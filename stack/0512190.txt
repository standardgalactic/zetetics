Abstract.
There are still no interacting models of the Wightman axioms, suggesting
that the axioms are too tightly drawn. Here a weakening of linearity for quantum
ﬁelds is proposed, with the algebra still linear but with the quantum ﬁelds no longer
required to be tempered distributions, allowing explicit interacting quantum ﬁeld
models. Interacting quantum ﬁelds should be understood to be nonlinear quantum
ﬁelds in this sense, because a set of eﬀective ﬁeld theories encodes a dependence on
the energy scale of measurement — which is a nontrivial property of the test functions
— so that correlation functions are implicitly nonlinear functions of test functions in
the conventional formalism. In Local Quantum Physics terms, the algebraic models
constructed here do not satisfy the additivity property. Finite nonlinear deformations
of quantized electromagnetism are constructed as examples.

Weakened linearity for quantum ﬁelds

1. Introduction
The free Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld is an operator valued linear map from a suitable
space of functions, ˆφ : f 7→ˆφf.
We will take f to be from a Schwartz space of
functions[1, §II.1.2], so that f(x) is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable and decreases as well
as its derivatives faster than any power as x moves to inﬁnity in any direction. For
the free Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld, ˆφ is then a tempered distribution. This is the
linearity we will weaken: we will allow the operator valued map ˆφ : f 7→ˆφf to be
nonlinear, so that the linear operators ˆφf, ˆφg and ˆφf+g will in general not satisfy the
linear dependence ˆφf + ˆφg = ˆφf+g. With this weakening, we cannot take a quantum ﬁeld
to be an operator-valued distribution ˆφ(x), we will be concerned only with operators
ˆφf. Note, however, that allowing ˆφ to be nonlinear does not weaken the linearity of
the algebra generated by the operators ˆφf, and we will be able to construct a linear
Hilbert space representation of the algebra of observables. The construction here is thus
diﬀerent from the nonlinear relativistic approach of Kibble, for example, who introduces
a nonlinear Hamiltonian operator[2].
The nonlinear quantum ﬁelds constructed here do not satisfy the additivity property
of Local Quantum Physics [1, Axiom B, §III.1]. This axiom requires that two algebras
of observables, associated with regions O1 and O2 in space-time, together generate the
algebra of observables associated with their union, A(O1 ∪O2) = A(O1) ∨A(O2), but
this is generally not possible if, for f and g with support in O1 and O2 respectively,
ˆφf+g ̸= ˆφf + ˆφg. The construction of this paper therefore casts some doubt on the
necessity of the additivity property as an axiom of quantum ﬁeld theory.
Locality and Lorentz covariance, however, will be preserved absolutely.
The
algebraic structure of a free linear quantum ﬁeld is given by the hermitian inner product
corresponding to the commutator, [ˆag, ˆa†
f] = (f, g), with ˆφf = ˆaf + ˆa†
f. A free linear
quantum ﬁeld is local just because [ˆφf, ˆφg] = (g, f) −(f, g) is zero whenever the test
functions f and g have space-like separated supports. Nonlinearity will be introduced
in two ways, ﬁrstly by the simple expedient of taking the commutator to be a sum of a
number of inner products such as, for example, without worrying here about constants,
[ˆag, ˆa†
f] = ξ(f, g) = (f, g) + (f + f 2, g + g2) + (f 2, g2) + (f(f, f), g(g, g))+
(f + ∂µf∂µf, g + ∂µg∂µg) + ...,
(1)
which will result in a local nonlinear quantum ﬁeld just because invariant polynomials in
the ﬁeld and its derivatives such as f n(x) = [f(x)]n or ∂µf∂µf have support contained
in Supp(f).
[ˆφf, ˆφg] = ξ(g, f) −ξ(f, g) is zero, as for the free ﬁeld, whenever the
test functions f and g have space-like separated supports. The constraints of locality,
positive semi-deﬁniteness and Lorentz invariance on the form of ξ(f, g) are satisﬁed by
many models, and it will turn out to be as easy to construct a vacuum state over this
algebra as over the linear free ﬁeld, allowing the GNS construction of a Hilbert space.
Secondly, we can deform the simple relationship ˆφf = ˆaf + ˆa†
f, setting ˆφf to be an

arbitrary self-adjoint operator-valued function of ˆaf + ˆa†
f, ˆaPi[f] + ˆa†
Pi[f], ...,
ˆφf = ˆF(ˆaf + ˆa†
f, ˆaP1[f] + ˆa†
P1[f], ˆaP2[f] + ˆa†
P2[f], X1(f), X2(f), ...),
(2)
where Supp(Pi[f]) ⊆Supp(f), and Xi(f) are arbitrary Poincar´e invariant scalar
functions of f — microcausality is satisﬁed whatever such scalar functions are
introduced. In the general case this deformation is quite nontrivial, more general than
a nonlinear coordinate transformation.
The energy scale of an experiment is essentially a pragmatic matter that is obvious
to an experimenter:
an experiment deals with phonons on a lattice, with atomic
energy levels, with nuclear energy levels, etc., without an exact explicit discussion
being necessary, and we can choose the cutoﬀappropriately for a given experiment
without too much detailed concern. From a quantum ﬁeld perspective, however, the
energy scale of an experiment is a very non-detailed measure of the structure of the test
functions involved in its description: if a test function appropriate to a description of
an experiment determines an eﬀective real-space length scale, or if the fourier transform
of the same (or another) test function is concentrated at a particular energy scale, then
such scales pragmatically determine what eﬀective ﬁeld model we use. Hence, there
is a prima facie case that the correlation functions of a quantum ﬁeld are nonlinearly
determined by properties of the test functions that describe an experiment, because the
test functions are involved in an explicit description of correlation functions not only
by smearing, so that interacting quantum ﬁelds should be understood to be nonlinear
quantum ﬁelds.
This signiﬁcantly reconceptualizes our understanding of interacting
quantum ﬁelds.
We will not here concern ourselves with the Hamiltonian operators of the theories
we discuss, because the Hamiltonian is a global (non)observable, so that any constraint
on it is essentially theoretical.
Additionally, the Hamiltonian is inessential to the
algebraic constructions of quantum ﬁeld theories given here. Instead, we will take n-
measurement correlation functions to be the observables of the theory, with empirical
adequacy achieved if a theory can accurately model experimental correlations.
Section 2 ﬁrst discusses free quantum ﬁelds, then section 3 introduces a large class of
models that weaken the linearity of the quantum ﬁeld by the introduction of a nonlinear
inner product, and section 4 discusses the introduction of a nonlinear map between ˆφf
and creation and annihilation operators. Section 5 applies the methods of section 3
to an electromagnetic ﬁeld, leaving the application of the methods of section 4 to the
future.
2. Free ﬁeld preliminaries
A simple way to construct the free Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld [3] is to project ˆφf
into two parts, ˆφf = ˆaf + ˆa†
f, and specify the algebraic properties of ˆa†
f and ˆaf by the
commutation relations
h
ˆag, ˆa†

(f, g) = ¯h
Z
d4k
(2π)42πδ(kµkµ −m2)θ(k0) ˜f ∗(k)˜g(k).
(4)
This ﬁxes the algebraic structure of the observables ˆφf, [ˆφf, ˆφg] = iω(f, g), where
ω(f, g) = i((f, g) −(g, f)) = −ω(g, f).
Note that the self-adjoint operators ˆφ′
f =
i(ˆaf −ˆa†
f) are taken not to be observable (if they were observable then we would be
able to send messages faster than light because [ˆφ′
f, ˆφg] = i((g, f) + (f, g)) is non-zero
when f and g have space-like separated supports‡). The vacuum expectation values
are ﬁxed by the trivial action of the operators ˆaf on the vacuum state, ˆaf |0⟩= 0,
and the normalization ⟨0|0⟩= 1. To compute any vacuum expectation value, apply
the commutation relations above repeatedly, eliminating any terms in which ˆaf |0⟩or
⟨0| ˆa†
f appear, until we obtain a number by ﬁnally applying ⟨0|0⟩= 1. For example,
⟨0| ˆφf ˆφg |0⟩= ⟨0| ˆafˆa†
g |0⟩= ⟨0| ((g, f) + ˆa†
gˆaf) |0⟩= (g, f).
The commutator algebra and the speciﬁcation of the vacuum state ﬁx the Wightman
functions of the theory at all times, which eﬀectively encodes all dynamical information,
so that a Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are superﬂuous in this approach to quantum
ﬁelds. Since the algebra and the deﬁnition of the vacuum are the only structures in this
approach, those are what we have to deform to create an interacting ﬁeld theory.
The free ﬁeld algebra determines that the probability density associated with
an observable ˆφf in the vacuum state is Gaussian.
The characteristic function can
be computed as ⟨0| eiλˆφf |0⟩= e−1
2λ2(f,f) by applying a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ
formula, leading to the probability density

, which is well-deﬁned
if we take f to be a Schwartz space function, but not if we take f to be a point-
like delta function.
In a similar way, we can compute the joint quasiprobability
density associated with two observables ˆφf and ˆφg in the vacuum state, which is
also Gaussian.
The characteristic function is ⟨0| eiλˆφf +iµˆφg |0⟩= e−1

Note that this quasiprobability is independent of the imaginary parts of (f, g). Finally
for the vacuum state, for a set of observables {ˆφfj} we obtain a characteristic function

‡ We can eliminate the creation and annihilation operators (which are too prominent in many
presentations of the free quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld), by presenting the algebra directly as [ˆφf, ˆφg] =
iω(f, g) and presenting the vacuum state using the generating function ⟨0| eiλˆφf |0⟩= e−1
2 λ2(f,f), with
ω(f, g) and (f, g) deﬁned as above. Together these are as suﬃcient to ﬁx the Wightman functions of
the theory as the construction in the main text is.

The singular condition det(F) = 0 is fairly innocuous, since it is the expectation values
that are signiﬁcant rather than any characteristic functions that can be used to generate
them.

The imaginary parts of (fi, g) contribute to equation (7), which consequently may be not
positive semi-deﬁnite§. It is straightforward, but progressively more time-consuming,
to compute n-measurement joint quasiprobability densities for higher states, which
introduce increasing deviations from a Gaussian distribution. We can in principle also
compute probability densities straightforwardly for higher order observables such as
ˆφf1 ˆφf2 + ˆφf2 ˆφf1.
The intention of this rather lengthy elementary discussion of characteristic functions
and quasiprobabilities is to give some sense of how we can compute empirically relevant
results quite eﬀectively by only considering the relations between explicit measurement
and state descriptions without ever considering operator-valued distributions ˆφ(x). We
have exclusively used inner products between the functions fi and g that were used
above to construct measurements and states. Using test functions universally has the
useful eﬀect of ensuring manifest Poincar´e invariance of the resulting formalism very
straightforwardly.
Note that we have used the term “n-measurement” correlations
instead of “n-point”, because we never measure anything at a point, and the idealization
of point-like measurements will become impossible when we introduce nonlinearity. All
calculations involve only Schwartz space functions, which are much easier to manipulate
than distributions, in particular because Schwartz space is closed under multiplication.
In a simple-minded way, it is arguable that the inﬁnities profusely generated by the
conventional perturbation of free quantum ﬁelds are caused by the introduction of higher
than quadratic products of distributions.
In more abstract terms, for free ﬁelds the properties of the vacuum state deﬁne a
state ϕ0 : A 7→⟨0| A |0⟩over the ⋆-algebra A generated by a ﬁnite number of creation
and annihilation operators, a linear map satisfying ϕ0(A†) = ϕ0(A), ϕ0(A†A) ≥0,
§ If instead of the inner product of equation (4), we use the real form (f, g) + (g, f), we still obtain
a quantum ﬁeld theory, but it is classical in the sense that [ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0 whatever the space-time
relationship between f and g, and equation (7) is accordingly positive semi-deﬁnite. For a comparable
perspective on the relationship between random ﬁelds and quantum ﬁelds see [3].

ϕ0(1) = 1, which allows the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction of a pre-Hilbert space
acted on by A, which can be closed in the norm to obtain a Hilbert space Hϕ0 (see
Haag[1, §III.2]).
For free ﬁelds, ϕ0(A) = ⟨0| A |0⟩satisﬁes ϕ0(A†A) = ⟨0| A†A |0⟩≥0 because

(g1 ⊗... ⊗gK, f1 ⊗... ⊗fK) 7→per[(gj, fk)],

is a complex hermitian positive semi-deﬁnite inner product on the symmetrized tensor
product space S⊗K, so that equation (8) deﬁnes a complex hermitian positive semi-
deﬁnite inner product on a direct sum of symmetrized tensor product spaces.
Any operator constructed as a multinomial in ˆφfi is not in the algebra B(Hϕ0) of
bounded observables acting on Hϕ0, so we generally have to pay attention to the domain
of A ∈A. The insistence on at least a Banach ⋆-algebra structure for the algebra of
observables is useful for analysis (allowing, for example, the extension of the action of
the algebra of observables to the Hilbert space Hϕ0), but for constructive calculations of
expectation values, characteristic functions, and probability distributions in particular
states, as above, if ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩is ﬁnite for a normalized vector |ψ⟩∈Hϕ0 then we can
interpret A as an observable for that state. This is a nontrivial extension of the pre-
Hilbert space because, for example, the normalized vector eˆa†
g |0⟩/
√
e(g,g) gives us a ﬁnite
state over A. As well as extending the pre-Hilbert space, we have already implicitly
extended the algebra A by using ⟨0| eiλˆφf |0⟩above as a characteristic function, since
eiλˆφf is not a polynomial in the ﬁeld.

where ξ(f, g) must be complex hermitian positive semi-deﬁnite on Schwartz space (in

normalized permanent per[(gj, gk)]/ QK

that is generated using inner products (gj, gk) measures how close the K functions gi are to being
parallel, independently of the relative lengths (gi, gi) of the functions, except in the singular case
when QK
i=1(gi, gi) = 0. If the functions are all parallel, the normalized permanent is K!; if they are
all orthogonal, the normalized permanent is 1. Comparably, the normalized determinant is zero if
any subset of the functions is linearly dependent; if all the functions are orthogonal the normalized
determinant is 1.

ﬁnite set of Schwartz space functions {fi}).
We will call ξ(f, g) a “nonlinear inner
product”; the term “inner product” historically indicates a sesquilinear form, so we will
always be explicit about nonlinearity. The operator valued map ˆφ : f 7→ˆφf cannot
be linear if ξ(f, g) is nonlinear. The algebra Ad generated by ˆφf is still linear, but the
linear dependence ˆφf + ˆφg = ˆφf+g generally does not hold.
Essentially, for any set of vectors {gi} used to construct an operator in the deformed
free ﬁeld algebra, we obtain a complex hermitian positive semi-deﬁnite matrix ξ(gi, gj).
As a complex hermitian positive semi-deﬁnite matrix, it is a Gram matrix based on
some other functions {fi} chosen so that (fi, fj) = ξ(gi, gj). The action of the vacuum
state on an operator A†A in Ad that is constructed using {ˆa†
gi} is positive semi-deﬁnite,
therefore, just because the action of the vacuum state on an operator constructed in the
same way in A using {ˆa†
fi} is positive semi-deﬁnite.
To ensure locality,
[ˆφf, ˆφg] = ξ(g, f) −ξ(f, g),
(11)
must be zero when f and g have space-like separated supports. There is a wide range of
possibilities for ξ(f, g): we can use the sum of any number of complex hermitian positive
semi-deﬁnite inner products such as
(f, g), (f + f 2, g + g2), (f 2, g2), ..., (f n, gn), ...,
(12)
just because the sum of positive semi-deﬁnite matrices is positive semi-deﬁnite.
All
these terms satisfy locality because f n has the same support as f, so that, for example,
ω(f n, gn) is zero if f and g have space-like separated support. We can also introduce
invariant polynomials in derivatives of the ﬁeld, such as ∂µf∂µf, which again have the
same support as f. Furthermore, we need not restrict ourselves to one inner product
(f, g), we can introduce diﬀerent mass Poincar´e invariant inner products for diﬀerent
invariant polynomials in the ﬁeld and its derivatives.
If the free quantum ﬁeld is a
4-vector or other nontrivial representation space of the Lorentz group, “f n”, perhaps
contracted in some way, will usually require a diﬀerent inner product than f (see section
5 for a concrete example). In general, ξ(f, g) can be a sum
ξ(f, g) =
X
i
(Pi[f], Pi[g])i
(13)
for a list of local functionals Pi, satisfying Supp(Pi[f]) ⊆Supp(f), and a list of linear
inner products (·, ·)i.
That we cannot in general expect the linear dependencies ˆφf + ˆφg = ˆφf+g and
ˆφλf ̸= λˆφf to hold requires a fresh understanding of what we do when we describe a
measurement using a function f +g or λf, which we must derive from the mathematical
structure of the nonlinear inner product. In the linear case, we can imagine in folk
terms that when we use the operator ˆφf we are asking how much f “resonates” with the
quantum state, insofar as the inner product of f with the functions gi that are used to
construct the state is a measure of similarity between the on-shell fourier components
of the functions. There is of course a minimal “resonance” of f with vacuum state

ﬂuctuations. In the nonlinear case, in the same folk terms, the nonlinear inner product
is a measure of similarity between not only the on-shell components of f and gi, but
also between the on-shell components of f 2 and g2
i , f + f 2 and gi + g2
i , etc. We cannot,
therefore, just add the results of measuring ˆφf and ˆφg to compute what we would have
observed if we had measured ˆφf+g, because the nonlinear resonances are not taken into
account by simple addition of the operators.
Analogously to equations (6) and (7), we can construct the pseudoprobabilities

(16)
in which the only change, predictably enough, is that we replace the inner product
(f, g) by the “nonlinear inner product” ξ(f, g) wherever it occurs.
The probability
densities generated for the vacuum state are still Gaussian (which will be addressed
by the method of the next section), but, for example, the fall-oﬀof the 2-measurement
correlation coeﬃcient with increasing distance is controlled by ξ(f, g), so the fall-oﬀis in
general nontrivially diﬀerent from the fall-oﬀfor the free ﬁeld. For scalar functions f(x)
and fa(x) = f(x+a) representing two measurements at separation aµ, and supposing the
dynamics is described by the inner product (4) with masses mi, then the 2-measurement
correlation function is given by
ξ(f, fa) = ¯h

so with a suitable choice of Pi, we have considerable control over the change of the
2-measurement correlation with increasing separation and for diﬀerent functions f.
4. Weakened linearity II
If we observe non-Gaussian probability densities, we can model them in linear quantum
ﬁeld theory by acting on the vacuum state with as many creation operators as
necessary, spread over as large a region of space-time as necessary, or by constructing
representations of the weakened linear commutation relations that are unitarily
inequivalent to the vacuum sector.
This section discusses the nonlinear alternative
already introduced in the introduction, which maps the creation and annihilation
operators nonlinearly to the quantum ﬁeld ˆφf,
ˆφf = ˆF(ˆaf + ˆa†
f, ˆaP1[f] + ˆa†
P1[f], ˆaP2[f] + ˆa†
P2[f], X1(f), X2(f), ...),

where Supp(Pi[f]) ⊆Supp(f), and Xi(f) are arbitrary Poincar´e invariant scalar
functions of f. Microcausality is preserved, [ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0 whenever f and g have space-
like separated supports, because [ˆaPi[f] + ˆa†
Pi[f], ˆaPj[g] + ˆa†
Pj[g]] = 0 ∀i, j, but if ˆF includes
a dependency on (f, f), for example, there is a larger sense in which the algebra of
observables is nonlocal. We take the set of observables to be the subalgebra of the
algebra of operators generated by ˆaf and ˆa†
f that is generated by ˆφf (as noted above,
the set of observables in the linear free ﬁeld case is generated by ˆφf, not by the creation
and annihilation operators).
In the simplest case, we can set G(ˆφf) = ˆaf + ˆa†
f for some invertible function
G(x); with this deformation, the gaussian probability density Pr(ˆaf + ˆa†
f = x) =
exp (−x2/2(f, f))/

2π(f, f) becomes
Pr(ˆφf = y) =

q
2π(f, f)
exp
 
−G(y)2
2(f, f)

G′(y).
(19)
This simplest case is of course more-or-less trivial, but in the most general case the
nonlinear map F is not so easily dismissed. Whether trivial or not, even for G(x) =
x −tanh x we obtain a probability density with the double maximum characteristic of
symmetry breaking,
Pr(ˆφf = y) =
1
q
2π(f, f)
exp
 
−(y −tanh y)2
2(f, f)

(1 −sech2 y)
(20)
(however this is not enough to claim that such a state corresponds to conventional
symmetry breaking).
Calculating n-measurement correlation functions in this
superﬁcially simple model for n ≥2 is not straightforward.
We have eﬀectively constructed a class of quantum ﬁelds that is analogous to
the class of integrable systems in classical ﬁeld theory in that they are reducible to
a free quantum ﬁeld by nonlinear (and possibly microcausality preserving but otherwise
nonlocal) maps.
In other attempts to construct algebras of observables using the
nonlinear operator-valued map ˆφ : f →ˆφf, using algebra deformations similar to those
of Arik-Coons type[6] (which work nicely in the one-dimensional case), I have not so
far found it possible to construct quantum ﬁeld algebras that are both microcausal and
associative, which I have taken to be essential requirements.
5. Deformation of electromagnetism
The electromagnetic potential and Dirac spinors are not observable ﬁelds, so we will
here deform the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld. To avoid excessive complexity, we will
use only the method of section 3. The dynamics of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in terms of
a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product on test functions is given by Menikoﬀand Sharp[7,
equation (3.27)] (except for a missing factor of (2π)−3 that is present in their equation
(3.25)):

Note that f1 and f2 are not electromagnetic ﬁeld tensors, they are classical test
functions that contribute to a description of measurement and/or state preparation of
the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld. The electromagnetic ﬁeld in an interacting theory
of the sort introduced here is not measurable at a point, so we always have to consider
ˆφf.
Supposing there is an observable 4-current ﬁeld, and that J1µ and J2µ are test
functions for it, we can introduce a massive free ﬁeld inner product

where σT ≥σS ≥0 determine the relative signiﬁcance of time-like and space-like
components (relative to kµ) of the 4-current. Note that any test function component for
which (f, f) is zero is in eﬀect inﬁnitely suppressed in the free theory¶, so σS = σT makes
only components orthogonal to kµ signiﬁcant and σS = 0 makes only the component
parallel to kµ signiﬁcant. In terms of these free ﬁeld inner products, we can introduce
an interacting nonlinear inner product,
( (J1, f1), (J2, f2) )I = (f1, f2)EM + (J1, J2)V +
λ1(Jα
1 + κ1J1µf µα
1 , Jβ
2 + κ1J2νf νβ
2 )V + λ2(J1µf µα

2 )V +
λ3(ǫµρσαJ1µf1ρσ, ǫντυβJ2νf2τυ)V
(23)
with λ1, λ2, and λ3 all ≥0, and of course higher order terms are possible. Degrees
of freedom that make no contribution to a noninteracting inner product may make
a contribution after we introduce a new term to a nonlinear inner product. Fourier
components of J1 that are not on mass-shell, for example, so that they make no
contribution to (J1, J2)V , may contribute to the on mass-shell fourier components of

1 . Introducing nonlinearity in this way, therefore, eﬀectively adds new degrees of
freedom as well.
Polynomial invariants in derivatives of both J and f can also be added, such as
(Jα

1 , Jβ
2 +κ2∂νf νβ
2 )V or (∂[αJ1µ]+κ3f1αµ, ∂[βJ2ν]+κ3f2βν)EM, again with higher
orders as necessary.
All the nonlinear terms introduced above can result in correlations between
the current and the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In the noninteracting case, the inner
product between test functions (J1, 0) and (0, f2) will always be zero, so there is no
correlation in the vacuum state between 4-current observables and electromagnetic ﬁeld
observables, but with the introduction of the nonlinear terms above there will generally
be correlations between 4-current observables and electromagnetic ﬁeld observables in
the vacuum state. Such interactions between the 4-current and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
through the action of nonlinearity in this approach are not immediately comparable
to the description of correlations in conventional perturbation theory through the
annihilation and creation of photon and charge lines in Feynman diagrams.
¶ The variance associated with the observable ˆφf in the vacuum state is (f, f); if this is zero, then the
observed value of ˆφf is always zero in the vacuum state (and indeed in every state).

If there is also an observable axial 4-vector, and S1µ and S2µ are test functions for
it, quite a few more terms become possible in a nonlinear inner product, even without
introducing derivatives,
( (J1, S1, f1), (J2, S2, f2) )I = (f1, f2)EM + (J1, J2)V + (S1, S2)V +

To these might also be added parity violating terms, and, with the introduction of a
scalar inner product, terms involving (J1µJµ
1 , J2νJν
2 )S, (S1µSµ
1 , S2νSν
2)S, (J1µSµ

Furthermore, every occurrence of an inner product could be
modiﬁed to make each term have a unique mass (and a diﬀerent contribution for the
time-like and space-like components of each 4-current and axial 4-vector term).
In view of the number of parameters that are apparently possible in this approach,
even in the case of electromagnetism, in contrast to the relatively tight constraints
imposed by renormalizability, equation (24) presumably has to be regarded as only
(potentially) phenomenologically descriptive, not as a fundamental theory, unless a
theoretically natural constraint on admissible terms emerges. Note that this approach
or some extension or modiﬁcation of it might be empirically useful, for example if it can
describe electromagnetic ﬁelds in nonlinear materials eﬀectively, without it being at all
equivalent to QED.
6. Conclusion
With all computations being entirely ﬁnite, it may be possible to use these nonlinear
quantum ﬁeld models more easily and with less conceptual uncertainty than using
conventional perturbation theory. The universal use of Schwartz space test functions to
describe measurement and state preparation ensures that there are none of the inﬁnities
that usually emerge in perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory.
Correlation functions for
measurements in a given state are straightforwardly computed in terms of the nonlinear
inner products between all the functions used to generate a state and to describe
measurements.
The mathematics allows a reasonable understanding of the nonlinearity that has
been introduced, and there seems to be no a priori reason to exclude this kind of
nonlinearity, in which the linearity of the algebra is preserved. Indeed, on the classical
precedent, nonlinearity ought to be expected. The apparent introduction of nonlinearity
by renormalization through the implicit nonlinear use of test functions gives a stronger
impetus to consider how empirically eﬀective the nonlinear models introduced here —
and perhaps more general models — can be.
The inﬁnite range of possibilities is at present a little uncontrolled, and the
mathematical analysis of the empirical consequences of particular terms in models of

the theory appear to be quite nontrivial — to my knowledge it is a novel mathematical
problem.
Quantum theory has largely moved to supersymmetry and string theory
because of the apparent impossibility of putting interacting quantum ﬁeld theory on a
sound mathematical footing, but the form of interacting quantum ﬁeld theories presented
here is a mathematically reasonable alternative.
It will be interesting to see what range of physical situations can be modelled with
these nonlinear quantum ﬁelds. Free ﬁelds are already useful as a ﬁrst approximation
in quantum optics, so it’s possible that the methods of this paper might make a useful
second approximation as a way to construct phenomenological models for nonlinear
materials.
These nonlinear quantum ﬁelds, however, are conceptually signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the interacting quantum ﬁelds of conventional perturbation theory, and
are manifestly diﬀerent from conventional constructive and axiomatic quantum ﬁelds.
