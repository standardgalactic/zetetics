Multi-Org Overview
Before Multi-Org structure was introduced, each unique Operating Unit or business unit 
required a separate Oracle instance. One-to-many relationships between Sets of Books, 
Legal Entities, and Operating Units were not possible within one Oracle installation.
Multi-org architecture is an application server-side enhancement that allows multiple 
operating units and their relationships to be defined within a single installation of Oracle 
Applications products. This keeps each operating unit's transaction data separate and 
secure.  
Multi-org structure allows you to logically partition all of your application data in one 
database. A type of an organization called an Operating Unit secures your application 
data.  It supports multiple organizations of the enterprise structure in a single database.  
Also, provides secure access to the data of the different organizations in your enterprise.  
Each application Responsibility is associated with an individual Operating Unit.

Definitions of Multi-org related components:
Set of Books
Set of Books is a combination of particular chart of accounts, functional currency, and accounting 
calendar. Oracle General Ledger secures transaction information (such as journal entries and balances) 
by set of books. When you use Oracle General Ledger, you choose a responsibility that is specific to a 
set of books. 
Business Group
The business group represents the highest level in the organization structure, such as the consolidated 
enterprise, a major division, or an operation company. The business group secures human resources 
information. Multiple sets of books can share the same business group if they share the same business 
group attributes, including HR flexfield structures.
Legal Entity
A legal company for which you prepare fiscal or tax reports. You assign tax identifiers and other legal 
entity information to this type of organization. There are currently only a few features provided for legal 
entities, such as intrastat movement reports and intercompany invoice generation.

Definitions of Multi-org related components contd…:
Operating Unit
OU is an organization that uses Oracle Cash Management, Order Management and Shipping Execution, 
Oracle Payables, Oracle Purchasing, and Oracle Receivables. It may be a sales office, a division, or a 
department. An operating unit is associated with a legal entity. Information is secured by operating unit 
for these applications. Each user sees information only for their operating unit. To run any of these 
applications, you choose a responsibility associated with an organization classified as an operating unit.
Inventory Organization
Inventory Organization is 1n organization for which you track inventory transactions and balances, 
and/or an organization that manufactures or distributes products.  Oracle Inventory, Bills of Material, 
Engineering, Work in Process, Master Scheduling/MRP, Capacity, and Receiving functions secure 
information by Inventory Organizations.  To run any of these applications, you must choose an 
organization that has been classified as an inventory organization.
Balancing Entity
Represents an accounting entity for which you prepare financial statements. This is a segment in the 
Accounting Key Flexfield structure (usually the Company segment) at which all accounting entries must 
balance. There may be multiple companies within the same structure, and each of these must balance 
within itself. Each legal entity can have one or more balancing entities.

Definitions of Multi-org related components contd…:
HR Organization
HR organizations represent the basic work structure of any enterprise. They usually represent the 
functional management, or reporting groups that exist within a business group. In addition to these 
internal organizations, you can define other organizations for tax and government reporting purposes, 
or for third part payments.
Project Organization
Oracle Projects allows you to define organization hierarchies to reflect company’s organizations 
structure. You can add Oracle Projects–specific organization types to the organization hierarchy to help 
you to better manage your project control requirements. You assign project and expenditure hierarchies 
to operating units.
Asset Organizations
An asset organization is an organization that allows you to perform asset–related activities for a specific 
Oracle Assets corporate depreciation book. Oracle Assets uses only organizations designated as asset 
organizations.

Multi Org Overview – contd….
Multi-Org is an important feature of Oracle Applications for several reasons:
- Allows multiple sets of books and multiple legal entities to be configured to operate 
in the same instance
- Provides support for data security between business units within a single applications 
installation
- Permits users to sell and ship products from different legal entities (in different sets 
of books) with automatic intercompany accounting
- Supports internal requisitions and purchasing/receiving products from different 
inventory organizations (within the same set of books)
- Enables an enterprise to be housed in one database instance of Oracle, spanning 
multiple countries, currencies, and legal entities without a reduction in response 
times (technical architecture-related)

The major components of Multi-Org
Business Group: The consolidated enterprise, a major division, 
or an operations company. Secures HR data like Organization, 
Employee. (This is assigned to Legal Entity.)
Set of Books: A set of books is a financial entity comprised of a 
chart of accounts, calendar, and functional currency. Oracle 
General Ledger secures information by set of books.
Legal Entity: A Legal entity for which fiscal or tax reports are 
prepared. Currently just a place holder for future Oracle 
functionality.
Operating Unit: Tied to a Legal Entity, an operating unit can 
only reference one set of books and one currency. Most Master 
Data Customers, Suppliers, Bank) and transaction data of AP, PO, 
AR, OM, CM are secured by Operating Unit. 
Inventory Organization: An organization that tracks inventory 
transactions by item. Oracle INV, BOM, Engineering, WIP, Master 
Scheduling/MRP, Capacity, and Purchasing Receiving all secure 
data by this type of organization. At least one Master Inventory 
Org needs to be defined to maintain item information.

Business Group
Highest level in the Multi-Org organization hierarchy.
The consolidated enterprise, a major division, or an operations 
company.
Secures HR data like Organization, Employee. 
Primarily used to segment the HR transactions and setups within 
a single instance installation by major enterprise groups
The employees or organizations defined within the business 
group drive the list of available employee or organization records 
that can be accessed by the applications at levels below it in the 
Multi-Org hierarchy.  For example, Purchasing is an operating-unit 
level application. The list of available employees that can be 
defined as buyers in the Purchasing module is controlled by the 
employees that are defined with the Business Group the 
operating unit rolls-up to.
Has no accounting impact

Set of Books (SOB)
Not directly in the organizational hierarchy, but highest level 
entity that impacts accounting
A set of books is associated with a single business group, but 
multiple sets of books can be associated to a single business 
group.
A set of books is a financial entity comprised of a chart of 
accounts, fiscal year calendar, and a functional currency (3 C’s). 
Oracle General Ledger secures information by set of books.
The set of books drives which chart of accounts, accounting 
calendar, and functional currency for all levels in the hierarchy 
below it.
The General Ledger (GL) is the primary application that secures 
financial data and transactions by set of books.

Legal Entity
A legal entity for which fiscal or tax reports are prepared. Tax 
identifiers and other relevant information are assigned at this 
level. 
Legal entities belong to a set of books and also belong to 
respective business group. One or more legal entities may be 
associated to a set of books, and multiple legal entities may be 
associated to a business group.
Some reports can be printed at Legal Entity level based on 
configuration
There is currently not much functionality at this level. Mainly a 
placeholder for future use of Oracle Multi-Org.
There are currently only a few features provided for legal entities, 
such as intrastat movement reports and intercompany invoice 
generation.

Operating Unit
Operating Unit is a level below Legal Entity in the hierarchy.
One or more operating units may belong to a single legal entity.
An operating unit can only reference one set of books. 
Master Data (Customers, Suppliers, Bank) and transaction data 
of AP, PO, AR, OM, CM are secured by Operating Unit. 
OU definition must be shared by all these modules and it would 
not be possible to determine centralized or decentralized 
functions.
An operating unit segments financial transactions by storing 
them in a sub-ledger. The sub-ledger is transferred to the 
General Ledger at the set of books level periodically in order to 
consolidate financial information across business units within the 
same management/statutory reporting entity.
A user responsibility is assigned to an operating unit. This 
restricts users logged-in with the responsibility to view and 
transact only upon data generated within that operating unit.

Inventory Organization
An organization tracks inventory transactions by item. 
Oracle Mfg modules like INV, BOM, WIP, MS/MRP, Capacity, 
and PO Receiving all secure data by Inventory Org. 
An inventory org rolls-up through one operating unit, but can 
be used in more than one operating unit within the same 
business group.
Inventory orgs to be accessed can be controlled as per 
responsibility by using Organization Access function.
In addition, the following can be controlled by Inventory 
Organization:
– Serial or Lot Number Control
– Manufacturing Workday Calendar
– Item Sourcing Rule for Replenishment etc
– Inventory Costing/Valuation Method

Additional components of Multi-Org (below Inventory org)
Master Organization and Child Organization: Inventory Org’s 
can be divided into 2 entities: Master Organization and Child 
Organization.  Master Organization is a kind of ‘reference inventory 
org’ to define items.  It is also called Item Master Org. Whereas 
Child Organization is an inventory org to track actual transaction 
data occurred in Mfg module like INV, COST, WIP, BOM etc for item 
assigned from master organization.
Subinventory: Subinventories are unique physical or logical 
separations of material inventory, such as finished goods or 
defective material. All material within an organization is held in a 
subinventory therefore, at least one subinventory is required.
Stock Locators: Stock Locators are used to identify physical areas 
where you store inventory items. Item quantities can be tracked by 
locator. Items can also be restricted to specific locators.

Components impacted by the Multi-Org structure
Responsibility: A responsibility lets a user access a specific set of Oracle Applications windows, 
menus, reports, and data to fulfill their role in the organization. Several users can share the same 
responsibility, and a single user can have multiple responsibilities.
Profile Option: A set of changeable options that affect the way your applications run.  These 
can be set at site, application, responsibility, and user level.
Balancing Entity: An entity for which you prepare a balance sheet, represented as a balancing 
segment in your accounting key flexfield.
Security Rules: Security rules limit the values of a Key Flexfield which the user will see.
Cost Center: A segment that indicates functional areas of your business, such as Accounting, 
Facilities, Shipping, and so on.  To make use of Cost Center Segment for dual purpose, for each 
Revenue and Expense natural account you must define a cost center segment value associated 
with it.  This way, the cost center segment will work as both Profit Center and Cost Center 
depending on the natural account associated with

Multi Org Decision Drivers
Financial Relationships:
Common denominator: Set of Books
– Chart of Accounts
– Calendar
– Currency
Financial transactions (i.e., intercompany accounting)
Financial reporting
Consolidations
Operational Relationships:
Common denominator: transactional data
Operational
– Transactions (internal requisitions, purchase orders across organizations, invoices, etc...)
– Reporting (sub-ledger, customer, etc…)
– Processes (transferring to GL, statements,  interfaces, etc…)

Considerations for Multi-Org Structure:
Security:
Data segregation and security by operating unit
Configuration:
Operating Unit applications can be configured by operating unit independently
Although some configuration setup information is shared, each application must be set up 
the same number of times as there are operating units 
Structure is more complex
Setup and maintenance increases
Functionality:
Multiple operating units or sets of books do not support centralized Entry.
Month-end reconciliation at sub-ledger level has to be done at each operating unit to 
facilitate closing the books. 
Customer sites are operating unit specific. Therefore, same customer information has to be 
entered and maintained in several OUs.
Vendor sites are operating unit specific.  They have to be maintained in several operating 
units.
Reporting:
Reporting security by responsibility can be set at the set of books, legal entity, or operating 
unit level
Most application reporting (except GL) is done at the operating unit level
Some reports can be done at the set of books, legal entity, or operating unit level.
