We review the recently discovered duality between color and kinematics in gauge theories. This duality leads
to a remarkably simple double-copy relation between diagrammatic numerators of gravity scattering amplitudes
and gauge-theory ones. We summarize nontrivial evidence that the duality and double-copy property holds to all
loop orders. We also comment on other developments, including a proof that the gauge-theory duality leads to
the gravity double-copy property, and the identiﬁcation of gauge-theory Lagrangians whose double copies yield
gravity Lagrangians.
1. Introduction
Gauge theory and gravity scattering ampli-
tudes have a far richer structure than evident
from their respective Lagrangians. As one such
example, in this talk we will describe a recently
discovered duality between color and kinematic
numerators of gauge-theory scattering amplitude
diagrams [1,2]. Remarkably, this duality appears
to have important implications for gravity: when
the gauge-theory numerators satisfy the duality,
the numerators of corresponding gravity theories
are given by a double copy of the gauge theory
numerators, diagram by diagram [1], as demon-
strated recently [3].
The double-copy property
has the beneﬁt of greatly clarifying the mysteri-
ous Kawai, Lewellen and Tye (KLT) relation be-
tween gauge and gravity tree amplitudes [4]. In
this talk we will focus on the recent progress in
extending the duality and double-copy properties
to loop level [2]. We also summarize the struc-
ture of gauge-theory Lagrangians whose Feynman
diagrams satisfy the duality, leading to gravity
Lagrangians that exhibit the double-copy prop-
erty [3].
Many of the recent developments for scatter-
ing amplitudes rely on on-shell methods, which
include on-shell recursion [5] at tree level and the
unitarity method [6] at loop level.

loops which decompose loop amplitudes into sums of

larly powerful approach to generalized unitarity
cut constructions [7] is the method of maximal
cuts [8,9], organizing the calculation starting from
unitarity cuts where all propagators are cut and
then systematically reducing the number of cut
propagators. On-shell methods allow one to con-
struct new amplitudes using simpler on-shell am-
plitudes as input. Cuts that decompose loop am-
plitudes into tree amplitudes, such as the sample
four-loop ones displayed in ﬁg. 1, are generally
the most advantageous ones to use. The unitar-
ity method gives a set of rules for reconstruct-
ing complete amplitudes from cuts. As discussed
in a variety of talks at this conference [10], the
unitarity method is by now a standard tool in
loop computations.
As one state-of-the-art ex-
ample from collider physics, it plays a central role
in progress towards the long-awaited NLO calcu-
lation of W + 4-jet production at the LHC, de-
scribed in this conference [11].
Multiloop calculations are typically rather in-
volved, yielding expressions with no easily acces-

sible structure or pattern.
Consider, e.g., the
rather lengthy results for gg →gg scattering am-
plitudes in QCD, given in refs. [12]. Might there
be a structure hidden in these rather opaque ex-
pressions? To answer this question, it is easiest to
begin by looking at one the simplest 2 →2 two-
loop amplitudes—identical helicity scattering in
QCD—ﬁrst computed in ref. [13].
The all-plus helicity amplitude is given in terms
of three integrals, two of which are displayed in
ﬁg. 2. The planar and non-planar double-box con-
tributions shown in ﬁg. 2 may be expressed in
terms of loop integrals as in ref. [13],

where the N(p, q) represent numerator polynomi-

that is, ℓi ≡ℓ[4]

+ λi, where ℓ[4]
i
has only four-
dimensional components and we take (−2ǫ) to be
positive. The propagators of the integrals are of
course diﬀerent and correspond to the two dia-
grams in ﬁg. 2. The prefactor depends on spinor
inner products ⟨i j⟩and [i j]; further details on
spinor-helicity notation may be found in, for ex-
ample, ref. [14]. We denote the number of gluon
states circulating in the loop by Ds −2, where
Ds is the dimension of spacetime. (Ds is the di-
mension of the polarization vectors which can be
taken to be independent of the dimension of the
loop momenta.)
The above result has a rather striking feature:
The numerators of the planar and non-planar in-
tegrals are identical. This feature is rather ob-
scure from a Feynman diagram point of view,
where no discernible relationship between the pla-
nar and non-planar contributions is apparent.
This curious feature seems to be an important
clue for novel structures in gauge-theory ampli-
tudes. But what might it be? We know now [1,2]
that this curiosity is a hint of hidden structures,
including:
• A new duality between color and kinemat-
ics.
• All-loop relations between planar and non-
planar diagrammatic integrands.
• A double-copy structure of gravity diagram
kinematic numerators in terms of gauge-
theory ones.
Although these properties are not yet com-
pletely proven, below we discuss evidence that
these properties hold to all loop orders.
2. A duality between color and kinematics
Any amplitude with all particles in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group can be arranged
into the form,
Atree
n
(1, 2, 3, . . ., n) =
X
i
ni ci
Q
αi p2αi
,
(1)
where the sum runs over the set of n-point dia-
grams with only cubic vertices and we suppress
factors of the coupling constant.
The product
runs over all propagators (internal lines) 1/p2
αi
of each diagram.
The ci are the color factors
obtained by dressing every three vertex with an
ef abc = i
√
2f abc structure constant, and the ni
are kinematic numerator factors depending on
momenta, polarizations and spinors (and Grass-
mann parameters for supersymmetric amplitudes
expressed in superspace). The form (1) follows

3
trivially from Feynman diagrams, by represent-
ing all contact terms as inverse propagators in the
kinematic numerators, which then cancel propa-
gators.
2.1. Tree-level duality
According to the duality proposal of ref. [1],
arrangements of the diagrammatic numerators in
eq. (1) exist such that they satisfy equations in
one-to-one correspondence with the color Jacobi
identities.
Speciﬁcally, we demand that every
color Jacobi identity induces a kinematic identity:
ci = cj −ck ⇒ni = nj −nk .
(2)
This duality is expected to hold in a large variety
of theories, including supersymmetric extensions
of Yang-Mills theory. At four points the duality
is automatically satisﬁed for any choice of valid
numerators [15,1], but at higher points the exis-
tence of such arrangements is rather nontrivial.
Indeed there is, as of yet, no complete proof that
this can always be accomplished.
Surprisingly,
this duality implies non-trivial relations between
the color-ordered partial amplitudes of gauge the-
ory [1]. A proof of these amplitude relations has
recently been given both in ﬁeld theory and in
string theory [16,17].
2.2. Gravity as a double copy of gauge the-
ory
Remarkably, once the gauge-theory amplitudes
are arranged into a form satisfying the duality
(2), gravity tree amplitudes are given by a double
copy of gauge-theory numerator factors [1],
−iMtree
n
(1, 2, . . . , n) =
X
i
ni ˜ni
Q
αi p2αi
,
(3)
where the ˜ni represent numerator factors of a sec-
ond gauge theory amplitude, the sum runs over
the same set of diagrams as in eq. (1), and we sup-
pressed the gravitational coupling constant. This
formula recently has been proven for pure gravity
and for N = 8 supergravity, under the assump-
tion that the duality (2) holds in the correspond-
ing gauge theories, by use of on-shell recursion [3].
If pure-Yang-Mills amplitudes are used, the ob-
tained gravity amplitudes correspond to Einstein
gravity coupled to an antisymmetric tensor and
dilaton; the n-graviton tree-level amplitudes of
this theory are those of pure Einstein gravity.
If both families of kinematic factors are for the
N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory, the gravity the-
ory amplitudes are those of N = 8 supergravity.
For this double-copy relation to hold, at least one
family of numerators (ni or ˜ni) needs to satisfy
the duality (2) [1,3]. Additionally, the ˜ni numer-
ator factors need not come from the same theory
as the ni factors. This allows for the construction
of gravity amplitudes with varying amounts of su-
persymmetry. The duality has also been studied
in string theory [18]. We note that the heterotic
string oﬀers a natural venue for understanding
these properties because of the parallel treatment
of color and kinematics [19].
2.3. Lagrangian insight
If one compares the Yang-Mills and Einstein
gravity Lagrangians
LYM =
1
4g2 F 2 ,
LG = 2
κ2
√−gR ,
(4)
it seems rather puzzling that gravity can be a dou-
ble copy of gauge theory. Indeed, the perturba-
tive expansions appear to be completely diﬀerent:
expanding the metric around ﬂat space, we ﬁnd
that gravity is composed of an inﬁnite sequence
of increasingly complicated vertices, whereas the
Yang-Mills Lagrangian has local interactions that
terminate at four points. On the other hand, the
KLT relations map the tree-level scattering am-
plitudes of gravity to those of gauge theory. This
suggests that the standard Lagrangians (4) ob-
scure the relation between the two.
Some initial steps in understanding the rela-
tionship between gravity and gauge theory at
the level of the Lagrangian were carried out in
ref. [20]. In particular, that paper developed some
tricks for separating the graviton Lorentz indices
into “left” and “right” classes, consistent with the
double-copy property. (See also ref. [21].) How-
ever, the connection to gauge theory remained
rather mysterious. As realized in ref. [3], the key
missing ingredient was the color-kinematic dual-
ity of ref. [1].
To see how to make the proper rearrangement,
consider ﬁrst the Yang-Mills Lagrangian.
The

4
Z. Bern, J. J. M. Carrasco and H. Johansson
initial step is to rearrange the Lagrangian so
its Feynman diagrams satisfy the color-kinematic
duality.
As noted earlier for four-point ampli-
tudes, the duality is automatic—the ordinary
form of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian generates di-
agrams that satisfy the duality.
Beyond four
points, for the duality to be satisﬁed directly
by the Feynman diagrams, we must modify the
Lagrangian yet leave the amplitudes unchanged.
For ﬁve points, this may be accomplished by
adding the following term to the Yang-Mills La-
grangian [3]:
L′
5 = −1
2g3(f a1a2bf ba3c
+f a2a3bf ba1c + f a3a1bf ba2c)f ca4a5
×∂[µ Aa1
ν] Aa2
ρ Aa3µ 1
□(Aa4νAa5ρ) .
(5)
This new term leaves the amplitudes unchanged
because it vanishes identically by the color-Jacobi
identity. Nevertheless, the canceling terms have
diﬀerent color structures and thus are associated
with diﬀerent diagrams. These terms modify the
individual diagrams so that the duality holds.
The additional term (5) is, however, nonlocal.
We can make the Lagrangian local by introduc-
ing a set of auxiliary ﬁelds as explained in ref. [3].
In fact, with a suﬃcient number of such ﬁelds,
all higher-point interactions can be replaced by
three-point interactions. Once the gauge-theory
Lagrangian has been put into this form, a gravity
Lagrangian which yields the correct amplitudes
is given simply by two copies of the gauge the-
ory Lagrangian, as described in ref. [3], with the
identiﬁcation Aa
µ ˜Ab
ν →hµν, dropping the color
factors. (The color indices play essentially no role
in this identiﬁcation.)
If one had an all orders Lagrangian, it would
be possible to investigate non-perturbative im-
plications. Because of the double-copy property,
one might expect that all classical solutions of
gravity could be written as double copies of solu-
tions of gauge theories. In particular, in coordi-
nate space we can expect gravity solutions to be
convolutions of gauge-theory solutions, with the
schematic form, gµν(x) ∼
R

µ(x −y) ˜Ab
ν(y).
3. The
color-kinematic
duality
at
loop
level
Very recently ref. [2] proposed that the color-
kinematic duality and gravity double-copy prop-
erty extends to all loop orders. This might seem a
rather bold conjecture, yet the unitarity method
provides strong motivation.
Indeed the duality
was ﬁrst observed in the three- and four-loop four-
point amplitudes of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills the-
ory, with various on-shell conditions imposed [1].
The success of the duality at the Lagrangian
level [3] is also quite suggestive.
The loop-level expressions for gauge and grav-
ity amplitudes would then be,

where we again suppressed the couplings and the
sums now run over all distinct n-point L-loop dia-
grams with cubic vertices. These include distinct
permutations of external legs, and the Sj are the
symmetry factors of each diagram.
As at tree
level, at least one family of numerators (nj or
˜nj) is constrained to satisfy the duality (2). We
expect these formulas to hold in a large class of
theories, including theories which are the low en-
ergy limits of string theories. It should also hold
in pure gravity, but in this case extra projectors
would be required to remove the extra unwanted
states arising in the direct product of two pure
Yang-Mills theories.
As at tree level, the ability to organize am-
plitudes around cubic graphs is trivially accom-
plished by inserting inverse propagators into the
numerators to account for contact terms.
The
non-trivial part of this conjecture is that there
always exists suﬃcient freedom to arrange gauge-
theory multiloop amplitudes in a way that sat-
isﬁes the color-kinematic duality (2).
The uni-
tarity method straightforwardly ensures that the
double-copy property of gravity extends to loop
level when it holds at tree level, since all cuts that
decompose loop amplitudes into products of tree
amplitudes will have this property [2,3].

3.1. Checks on the loop-level conjecture
Since we do not yet have a proof that the color-
kinematic duality holds, it is important to check
some explicit examples. The known one and two-
loop four-point amplitudes of N = 4 super-Yang-
Mills theory and N = 8 supergravity, as given in
ref. [22], satisfy the conjectures (6). Another ex-
ample is the previously mentioned two-loop four-
point identical-helicity amplitude of pure Yang-
Mills theory [13], which can also be shown to sat-
isfy the duality [1,2].
A more sophisticated example, which we out-
line here, is the three-loop four-point amplitude
of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory. This ampli-
tude oﬀers a rather non-trivial check of the dual-
ity given both the high loop order and the non-
trivial dependence of the numerators on loop mo-
menta. It was originally constructed in refs. [23,9]
via the unitarity method. In ref. [2], the duality
was made manifest by appropriate reshuﬄings of
terms in the earlier forms of the amplitude.
The duality requires that the numerator identi-
ties in eq. (2) must be imposed for every propaga-
tor in every diagram. In ﬁg. 4 we display one such
numerator relation. For any diagram, we can de-
scribe any internal line, carrying some momentum
ls, in terms of formal graph vertices V (pa, pb, ls),
and V (−ls, pc, pd) where the pi are the momenta
of the other legs attached to ls, as illustrated on
the left side of ﬁg. 4.
The duality (2) requires
that,
n({ V (pa, pb, ls), V (−ls, pc, pd), · · · }) =
n({ V (pd, pa, lt), V (−lt, pb, pc), · · · })
+ n({ V (pa, pc, lu), V (−lu, pb, pd), · · · }) ,
where n represents the numerator associated with
the diagram speciﬁed by the set of vertices, the
omitted vertices are identical in all three dia-
grams, and ls ≡(pc + pd), lt ≡(pb + pc) and lu ≡
(pb + pd) in the numerator expressions. There is
one such equation for every propagator in every
diagram. Solving the system of distinct equations
enforces the duality conditions (2). It turns out[2]
that a solution to the duality relations is found in
terms of the 12 diagrams displayed in ﬁg. 3.
Of course the amplitude must be the correct
one for the theory under consideration, and thus

The reader may check that all dual-

ity, conﬁrming it on a complete set of cuts using
the known amplitude [23,9].
4. Comments and conclusions
In this talk we summarized a recently proposed
gauge-theory duality between color and kinemat-
ics, leading to a double-copy property for gravity
theories [1,2].
Although the duality remains a
conjecture, we can even now exploit it to guide
loop computations, simply by enforcing the du-
ality and verifying the consistency with the uni-
tarity cuts.
This is helpful both for organizing
gauge-theory amplitudes and for obtaining the
corresponding double-copy gravity amplitudes.
There are a number of interesting open prob-
lems related to the color-kinematic duality.
In
particular, it would be helpful to carry out fur-
ther checks of the duality for multiloop processes.
More generally an all-orders proof would be im-
portant, especially if it leads to new insight into
the origins of the duality. The duality suggests
the existence of a group theoretical construc-
tion of the kinematic numerators, which would,
of course, be very interesting to develop.
We
would also like to have Lagrangians whose dia-
grams satisfy the duality to all orders, and which
give gravity Lagrangians as double copies, along
the lines described in ref. [3]. We expect this to
have non-trivial implications at strong coupling.
It seems likely that the duality should hold as well
in higher-genus perturbative string theory.
The duality and double-copy property may also
shed new light on the issue of ultraviolet diver-
gences in N = 8 supergravity.
For four-point
amplitudes through four loops, explicit compu-
tations show that ultraviolet cancellations exist
beyond those needed for ﬁniteness [22,23,9,24].
Beyond this, the situation is less clear. A consen-
sus has formed that supersymmetry alone cannot
prevent divergences in four dimensions starting
at seven loops [25,26,27].2
Although nontrivial
cancellations are known to exist to all loop or-
ders [29], we do not know if these cancellations
are suﬃcient to render the theory ﬁnite.
Re-
cent reviews discussing the ultraviolet properties
of N = 8 supergravity may be found in refs. [30].
The
color-kinematic
duality
and
gravity
double-copy structure likely have important non-
perturbative implications.
In particular, these
properties suggest that classical solutions in grav-
ity theories may be expressible as double copies
of classical solutions in gauge theories.
