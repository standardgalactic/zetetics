Abstract
The unfolded state of proteins displays a sur-
prisingly rich amount of local native structure, which
appears to be critical for driving the protein to its native
state. Peptides with the same sequence of the correspond-
ing structured segments can be used to interfere with the
correct folding of the protein. Using model simulations, we
investigate the folding of hen-egg lysozyme, identifying its
key segments. Activity assays, NMR and circular dichro-
ism experiments are used to screen the peptides which are
able to inhibit the folding of lysozyme. Few peptides,
corresponding to the segments of the protein which are
structured in the unfolded state, are identiﬁed to have
signiﬁcant inhibitory effects.

Introduction
Until few years ago, it was widely accepted that the
denatured state of proteins is a random coil. This idea was
based on measurements carried out by Tanford in the 1960s
[1], who showed that the size of a series of proteins
denatured by guanidinium chloride is the size of a random
coil. But, as pointed out only recently [2], something which
has the size of a random coil is not necessarily a random
coil. Moreover, the denatured state in guanidinium chloride
can be very different from the denatured state in biological
conditions, which is the one controlling folding [3].
As a matter of fact, NMR experiments on several
proteins point out the presence of weak but detectable
structure in the denatured state [4–7], even under strongly
denaturant conditions [8]; often such structure is native and
involves the same residues which build out the folding
nucleus (FN) [4, 5], that is the set of native contacts whose
formation allows the protein to overcome the main free-
energy barrier towards the native state. Simulations with
simpliﬁed models conﬁrm that a number of small, single-
domain proteins fold by structuring in the denatured states
in some segments, which dock together to form the FN [9].
We call these segments local elementary structures (LES).
These ﬁndings suggested the possibility of inhibiting the
biological activity of proteins by blocking their folding,
using for the purpose peptides (called p-LES) with the
same sequence of a LES of the target protein [10]. As a
p-LES has the same molecular structure as a LES, its
speciﬁcity with respect to the complementary LES, having
been tooled by evolution, is high and its afﬁnity strong. In
any case, as strong as the afﬁnity which stabilizes the FN.
Adding to the protein solution a concentration of p-LES
large enough, the entropic cost of binding is small and one
stabilizes a state which is partially denatured (and thus
inactive) with the p-LES bound in the interior. This
mechanism has been proven to be particularly efﬁcient to
inhibit the folding of HIV-1 protease [11]. In this case, as
in all the cases of viral proteins, p-LES inhibitors have a

great advantage with respect to traditional drugs. In fact, as
they target a segment of the protein which is critical for the
folding of the enzyme, it is unlikely that the virus can
mutate it in order to decrease its afﬁnity for the inhibitor,
producing pharmacological resistance.
The main problem in the application of the p-LES
strategy is to locate the LES of the protein one wishes to
inhibit. This can be done in different ways, for example
studying the early events of protein folding by model
simulations [13, 14]; studying the amino acid conservation
pattern and making the assumption that, because the LES
are so important for the folding of the protein, they should
be highly conserved [14]; testing the effect on folding/
activity of a set of peptides whose sequence overlap with
the full-length sequence of the protein [15, 16].
In the following sections we shall discuss the inhibition
of the folding of hen-egg lysozyme. Although this protein
is of no pharmaceutical interest, its folding has been widely
characterized [12, 17], it is easy to obtain and handle and,
consequently, is a good model to study and describe the
p-LES strategy.
Lysozyme is composed of 129 residues, its native
conformation displays ﬁve helices and a three-stranded
b-sheet, and is stabilized by four disulphide bridges. Its
native conformation is remarkably stable: at neutral pH, its
folding temperature is around 70oC [18] and it does not
unfold in 8M urea unless upon consistent addition of salts
[19]. At neutral pH only two states are populated at equi-
librium, while an intermediate appears at acidic conditions
[20]. Its folding kinetics is anyway complex: it displays at
least three time scales and thus suggests that transient
intermediates exist also at neutral pH, even if not populated
at equilibrium [17]. Its role is that of catalyzing the
hydrolysis of a polysaccharide which builds out the cellular
wall of several bacteria. Also the enzymatic reaction has
been widely studied [21] and involves Glu-35 and Asp-52.
First, we will study the folding of lysozyme with a
simpliﬁed model, identifying residual structure in the
unfolded state both in native- and strongly denaturant
conditions. Next, different experimental techniques are
used to screen the inhibition properties of a set of peptides
whose sequence overlaps exhaustively the sequence of
lysozyme. Few of these peptides, corresponding to regions
which are structured in the unfolded state, display signiﬁ-
cant inhibitory effects, preventing lysozyme from folding.
Materials and methods
Model simulations
Lysozyme (PDB code: 2LYZ) is simulated using a
coarse grained geometry representing both the backbone
and the side-chains. In particular, the backbone is rep-
resented by a connected chain of Ca atoms separated by
3.8 A˚ . The ith side-chain is geometrically represented by
a second bead, Cb(i), linked at ﬁxed distance l = 3.0 A˚
to the Ca(i) atom and whose position is uniquely deter-
mined by the positions of Ca(i - 1), Ca(i), a(i ? 1) as
described in the work of Park and Levitt [22]. It follows
that for the ﬁrst and last atoms of the chain, the Cb
position is undetermined and therefore replaced with the
Ca atom itself.
The Ca atoms interact with any other atom through a
generic excluded volume term while the interactions
between Cb atoms are given by a heterogeneous Go¯-like
potential Ubb written as follows

where {rij} are the positions of the Cb atoms in a given
conformation and {rij
N} are the Cb positions in the native
structure. RC = 5.5 A˚ and RH = 1.0 A˚ are the interaction
and hardcore range, respectively, and h(x) = 1 if x [ 0
and 0 otherwise. The energies constants eH = 1,000 and
eR = 5.0 are respectively the hardcore barrier and the
repulsive energy for non-native pairs, while Uij is the
attractive energy between native pairs. These matrix ele-
ments are the average Van der Waals interaction between
all the atoms of residues i and j averaged over a 10 ns all
atom explicit-solvent simulation of the native conforma-
tion at T = 300 K using the GROMOS force-ﬁeld and the
GROMACS package. The four disulﬁde bonds between
residues 6–127, 30–115, 64–80 and 76–94 are imple-
mented setting Uij = -1,000 resulting in unbreakable
bonds at the simulated temperatures. All the energies and
temperatures are expressed in kJ/mol unless otherwise
speciﬁed.
The speciﬁc heat shown in the inset of Fig. 1 is calcu-
lated by applying the multiple histogram method to 10
Monte Carlo simulation runs of 5 9 109 steps at a constant
temperature ranging from T = 1.5 to T = 4.0. From
its peak the folding temperature is found to be Tf = 1.97.
The protein is then simulated with 100 Monte Carlo runs
of 1 9 109 steps each at two different temperatures
T = 1.5 \ Tf and T = 2.5 [ Tf leading to 106 conforma-
tions for analysis. All the starting conformations were
randomly generated keeping the four disulﬁde bonds
formed.

presence of at least one native contact between the two
fragments (i.e. non null denominator) and a low stability of
this same contact(s) (low numerator). Using these two
parameters, we say that a LES must display a high P[n;m] in
the unfolded state while keeping P½n;m½n0;m0 low, reﬂecting
both local stability and poor non-local interactions in the
unfolded state.

Enzymatic activity of lysozyme was determined by

suspension
(substrate
solution)
at
ﬁxed
wavelength. The suspension of Micrococcus lysodeicticus
was prepared by mixing Micrococcus lysodeicticus (5 mg)
with a 66 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0
(50 ml). The mixture was suspended by gentle swirling and
incubated at 25C for 1 h. The samples of lysozyme and of
different complexes with peptides (obtained as described
below) were mixed with 1 ml of substrate suspension. The
intensity decrease in light scattering was monitored by a
Jasco UV–vis spectrophotometer (Jasco V-550) at 450 nm
for 180 s. The value of the initial velocity of the reaction
was determined by a linear extrapolation of the data.
In order to measure the enzymatic activity of lysozyme
incubated with 25 different peptides in DMSO 80%, we use
the following procedure. A 4.2 M lysozyme solution was
prepared in a 66 mM potassium phosphate buffer at
pH 7.0. Its concentration was determined spectrophoto-
metrically at 280 nm, using an extinction coefﬁcients of
2.63 mg ml-1 cm-1. 4 mg of each peptide was dissolved in
1 ml of DMSO and 20 ll of this solution was diluited with
980 ll of DMSO. The concentration of the obtained pep-
tide solution was 80 lM. In order to incubate the protein
with peptide, 25 ll of lysozyme solution was mixed with
100 ll of peptide solution. The lysozyme reference solu-
tion in absence of peptide was prepared in the same way
mixing 25 ll of lysozyme solution with 100 ll of DMSO.
The samples were incubated at 25C for 45 min. In the
incubated samples the enzyme and the peptide had a
nominal concentration of 0.9 and 64 lM, respectively. In
the case of peptides 6–15, 71–80, 91–100, 106–115 and
121–129, the same experiments were performed at differ-
ent concentrations (2, 10, 20 and 40 lM).
Activity assays for the determination of inhibition con-
stant within the Michaelis–Menten theory were performed
on a range of substrate concentrations from 0.3 to 0.02 mg/
ml. 1 ml of Micrococcus lysodeicticus suspension was
mixed with 12 ll of the incubated solutions prepared as
above with peptide 91–100 and peptide 106–115 and the
value of the initial velocity of the reaction was determined.
In the case of incubation of lysozyme with peptides 6–
15, 91–100, 106–115 and 16–25 in the presence of urea, we
use the following procedure. 2 ll of the solution of peptide
dissolved in DMSO were diluted with 98 ll of buffer
(pH 7.00) with urea 9 M. The concentration of the
obtained peptide solution was 80 lM. 25 ll of lysozyme
solution 4.2 lM was mixed with 100 ll of peptide solu-
tion. The sample was then heated at 85C for 90 s. After
45 min at 25C, the activity was measured. The lysozyme
reference solution in the absence of the peptide was
prepared in the same way mixing 25 ll of lysozyme
solution with 98 ll of buffer with urea 9 M and 2 ll of
DMSO. In the incubated samples, the enzyme and the
peptide had a nominal concentration of 0.9 lM and 64 lM,
respectively and the urea was 7.1 M.
For

spectroscopy,
the
lysozyme solution is prepared by mixing 4.6 mg of protein
in 500 ll of phosphate buffer at pH 6 together with 9 M
deutered urea. The solution of lysozyme and peptide 91–100
is prepared by mixing 4.6 mg of protein and 1 mg of
peptide in 500 ll of phosphate buffer together with 9 M
deutered urea. The samples are incubated at 85C for 90 s
in order to unfold it, and at 25C for 45 min. Homonuclear
1 H NMR experiments were performed at 600 MHz on a
Bruker Avance spectrometer. The probe temperature was
maintained at 298 K and water suppression was carried out
using the presaturation or the excitation sculpting with
gradients sequence. In TOCSY experiments, a mixing time
of 80 ms was applied to obtain remote scalar connectivi-
ties. NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing time of
300 ms. The spectral width was about 16 ppm.
Results
Lysozyme is, under biological conditions, a two-state
folder, displaying a phase-transition between a native (N)
and an unfolded (U) state [12]. While the native state has
been widely characterized in the literature, little is known
about the unfolded state due to the difﬁculty to study it both
experimentally and resorting to simulations.
It is important to notice that in all the simulations and
the experiments described below, the four disulphide
bridges which stabilize the native conformation are kept
intact.
The basis of folding inhibition: model simulations
of the unfolded state
All atom models in explicit solvent can appropriately
describe the interactions within proteins, but are compu-
tationally too demanding to sample the unfolded state. For
this purpose we make use of a coarse-grained protein
model (see ‘‘Materials and methods’’), which is able to
reproduce some experimental data [13] and can sample
exhaustively the conformational space of small proteins.
The free energy of lysozyme as a function of the
dRMSD to its crystallographic native state is shown in
Fig. 1 at a temperature slightly higher than its folding
temperature Tf, showing the expected two-state behavior.
The transition state, corresponding to the top of the free-
energy barrier which separates the two states, is located at
dRMSD & 6 A˚ . The folding temperature at which the
914
Eur Biophys J (2010) 39:911–919
123

speciﬁc heat shows a peak is Tf = 1.97 (cf. the inset of
Fig. 1).
The unfolded state is studied extracting from the simu-
lations a representative set of conformations with high
dRMSD (see ‘‘Materials and methods’’). The native contact
maps associated with the unfolded states obtained at
T = 1.5, to describe the unfolded state under native con-
ditions, and T = 2.5, to describe the unfolded state under
strongly denaturing conditions, are displayed in the higher
halves of Fig. 2 (upper and lower panel, respectively). The
tone of each square reﬂects the statistical weight of the
associated contact.
Looking at the high-temperature contact map, the most
stable contacts are mostly local (i.e., close to the diago-
nal) and involve regions of the ﬁrst two helices (residues
6–36) and the regions 58–65, 78–84 and 105–116. The
only non-local contacts are concentrated in regions close
to the four disulﬁde bonds between the eight cysteine
residues. On the other hand, the low-temperature contact
map, aside from an expected overall higher stability,
displays several non-local stable contacts, like those
between region 1–12 and region 25–41, that is the ﬁrst
alpha helix with the second one.
We are interested in locating the LES of the protein.
Since they are expected to drive the protein from the
unfolded to the native state, crossing the transition state, we
look for them among the segments of the protein which
build in the unfolded state stable local contacts (resulting in
a high P[n;m]), but do not stabilize non-local contacts (low
P½n;m½n0;m0). In fact, if two segments of the protein build
non-local contacts already in the unfolded state, their
docking cannot be associated with the crossing of the
transition state and hence cannot qualify as LES.
Operatively, we calculate the average stability of all the
possible segments of lysozyme of length between 8 and 15,
allowing for a maximum overlap of 4 residues. Within this
set, we keep only the ‘‘good candidates’’, those segments
which interact with at least another segment in the native
state, but whose mutual interaction in the unfolded state
is small (for details, see ‘‘Materials and methods’’). The
resulting data is shown in Fig. 3 for both cases of high
and low temperatures. At high temperature there are three
main regions where such segments are concentrated,
namely 1–25, 42–69 and 73–105 (named I, II and III
in Fig. 3). The same regions are also identiﬁed in the
low-temperature
data,
together with
a fourth region
corresponding to residues 29–41. The segment 105–116,
although resulting stable in the unfolded state, is already
docked to its native counterpart and thus does not appear in
Fig. 3.
From the contact map and the native tridimensional
conformation we observe that both regions 1–25 and 42–69
are in contact with region 73–105. Consequently, we
expect them to contain the LES of the protein and their
docking to nucleate its folding.
Folding inhibition: experimental results
It was shown in [10, 11, 15] that peptides (p–LES) with the
same sequence than that of a LES stabilize the unfolded
state. This effect is due to the fact that the p–LES binds to
its complementary LES in the protein, preventing the for-
mation of the correct FN and thus the crossing of the
transition state. The result is an inactive protein.
To identify experimentally the p–LES of lysozyme we
have measured the activity of hen egg lysozyme in the
presence of 25 peptides. Each of them is built out of ten
amino acids (except for the one corresponding to the
C-terminal, which is of length 9), and with sequence
identical to that of the segment of the enzyme delimited by
amino acids 1–10, 6–15,..., 111–120, 116–125 and 121–
129. The initial velocity of enzymatic reaction of lysozyme
by itself (v0) and of lysozyme incubated with each of the 25
peptides (vp) has been measured and the corresponding
ratios v0/vp are displayed in Fig. 4. Peptides 6–15, 91–100
and 106–115 show a v0/vp \ 0.5 and thus are good inhib-
itors of folding. Looking at the structure of the protein they
correspond to the ﬁrst helix A, to the last three turn of helix
C and to the helix D.
Unlike HIV-1 protease, which is marginally stable and
allows the corresponding p–LES to penetrate its native
conformation under biological conditions [11], lysozyme is
remarkably stable. Consequently, the incubation was car-
ried out placing the protein and the peptide in 80% DMSO,
to ensure enzyme denaturation, and then return to folding

conditions (8% DMSO). During this process the peptide
can penetrate the unfolded enzyme and compete with the
corresponding segment of the protein in forming its native
contacts.
The effect of the most efﬁcient inhibitory peptides
91–100 and 106–115 on the protein has been characterized
in detail. The enzymatic kinetics of the protein is formally
consistent with a noncompetitive inhibitions [15], due to
the presence of large kinetic barriers that the peptide meets
for binding the protein under native conditions. During the
incubation of the peptide with lysozyme in denaturating
conditions, the kinetic barriers are small and there is an
equilibrium between the two molecules. As the system is
brought back to native conditions, the kinetic barriers
return to be large and partitioning takes place between the
native enzyme and the inactive enzyme complexed with
peptide. From standard analysis we obtained the two con-
stants of inhibition KI = 19 lM for peptide 91–100 and
KI = 60 lM for peptide 106–115 [15]. These can be
compared with the values of KI obtained from the ratios
v0/vpep through a two-state model, which gave [15]
KI = 21 lM
for
peptide
91–100,
KI = 57 lM
for
106–115. From the velocity ratios displayed in Fig. 4 one
can also obtain KI = 43 lM (peptide 6–15), KI = 83 lM
(peptide 71–80) and KI = 59 lM (peptide 121–125).
If the mechanism we propose is correct, the inhibitory
efﬁciency of peptides is not expected to be dramatically
dependent on the denaturing agent used during incuba-
tion.The activity of lysozyme incubated at 85C for 90 s in
solution with peptides 6–15, 91–100, 106–115 and 16–25
(as negative control) has been measured in 9 M urea, to
avoid aggregation (lysozyme in 9 M urea at neutral pH is
folded and active [19], cf. Fig. 5). Their velocity ratios
v0/vpep are 0.44, 0.51, 0.62, respectively, for the three
inhibitory peptides (see Fig. 4), conﬁrming their ability to
inactivate lysozyme also upon heat denaturation, while it is
0.98 for the control peptide 16–25.
To prove that inhibition is due to unfolding of lysozyme,
NMR spectra have been recorded for the complex of
lysozyme with the peptide 91–100. Incubation was carried
out in the presence of 9 M urea solution as in the activity
assays in order to prevent aggregation and incubation has

been carried out at 85C. In Fig. 5, the 2D NOESY spectra
of lysozyme in water is shown (left panel), in the presence
of 9 M urea (central panel) and incubated with peptide
91–100 (right panel). The shapes of the ﬁrst two spectra are
similar and display a good dispersion of crosspeaks
between amide and sidechains signals, consistently with
the native character of the protein. In the spectrum of
lysozyme incubated with peptide 91–100 the peaks col-
lapse towards the chemical shifts associated with random
conformations, testifying to the fact that the protein is no
longer in its native conformation. In particular, all the
assigned peaks are lost and no more recognizable.
In order to quantify the ability of peptide 91–100 to inhibit
the folding of lysozyme, circular dichroism experiments have
been performed at different peptide concentrations (cf. ref.
[15]). The resulting inhibition constant extracted from the
values of ellipticity at a ﬁxed wavelength (k = 233 nm)
through a two-state model (see ref. [15]) is KI = 17 lM and
it is not inconsistent with those obtained from activity assays
(i.e., KI = 21 lM and KI = 19 lM, see above).
Can we predict the inhibitors from easily accessible
data?
So far, we have identiﬁed the LES (and thus the p–LES)
of lysozyme through extensive folding simulations and
through the direct measurement of the effect of peptides on
the enzyme. It is interesting to check if there are some
features of the protein which can be obtained more readily
and which allow to locate the LES or, at least, provide
some information about them.
A ﬁrst consideration which can be useful is that the
segments of the protein which are critical for its folding
are likely to be evolutionary conserved. Given a family
of proteins displaying the same native conformation, a
measure of the degree of conservation of each residue is the
entropy per site SðiÞ ¼ PpiðrÞlnðpiðrÞÞ; where pi(r) is
the frequency of appearance of residue of type r at site i.
Regions where sequence variation is high-yield low con-
servation and consequently have a high value of entropy
while regions where the sequence variation is low are
expected to display a low value of entropy.
Making use of a family of proteins structurally similar to
lysozyme but with sequence identity lower than 25% we
calculate the entropy per residue as shown in Fig. 6. In
particular residues 8, 12, 16, 30, 42, 54, 57, 84, 86, 87, 88,
89, 95, 96, 97 display a value of entropy lower than the
mean value minus standard deviations (\S[ = 1.80,
r = 0.28). The most conserved regions are then 1–20,
52–64 and 76–99. These segments are subsets of the three
LES identiﬁed by the folding simulations (1–25, 42–69 and
73–105) and two of them overlap with the p–LES found
experimentally (i.e., 6–15 and 91–100).
A second element playing a fundamental role during the
folding process is the interaction energy between amino
acids. In order to become stable at early stages of folding,
the segment of the protein must carry a signiﬁcant fraction
of the stabilization energy of the protein. Following the
method described in [25], we have calculated this quantity
making use of short all atom molecular dynamics simula-
tions in explicit water using GROMACS, extracting the
matrix Uij of the average interaction energy between the
pairs of amino acids. If the lowest eigenvalue displays a
large gap to the others, then the protein is stabilized
cooperatively by the residues identiﬁed by the eigenvector
corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue. The lowest
eigenvalue of lysozyme (k1 = -80.4 kJ/mol) displays a
large energy gap, that is 11.3 kJ/mol (corresponding to
4kBT), with respect to the next one. The associated eigen-
vector is displayed in Fig. 7. Two regions display large

amplitudes (23–35 and 105–116) and other two regions
with a lower but signiﬁcant amplitude (50–65 and 90–101).
Of these regions, 90–101 matches both the simulated LES
and the p–LES determined experimentally, 50–65 only the
former and 105–116 only the latter.
To be noted that a more naive analysis of the distribu-
tion of stabilization energies across the protein is not
easy to interpret. In fact, from the average energy per site
Ei ¼ P129
j6¼i Uij in the native conformation shown in Fig. 8
one cannot clearly identify any LES of the protein.
The same is true for the distribution of hydrophobic
residues along the chain. In Fig. 9, the degree of hydro-
phobicity according to the scale of Hopp and Woods [26] is
shown. Also in this case no clear pattern can be found.
From this analysis, we conclude that evolutionary data
of conserved residues in analogous proteins together with
the decomposition of the interaction matrix in its principal
eigenvector can help spotting the LES. On the other hand,
in more trivial analysis such as the average energy per site
or the residue hydophobicity, does not give any sensible
information. Anyhow, those methods must be comple-
mented with simulations or experimental assays to have a
clearer picture of the early structuring fragments and are
not sufﬁcient by themselves to identify the LES.
Discussion and conclusions
The characterization of the unfolded state is of great
interest to understand protein folding, because not only the
folding path is determined there, but it is also very difﬁcult
to carry out. Standard all-atom simulations in explicit
solvents are computationally very demanding. Experi-
mentally, the unfolded state can be stabilized and studied
by means of chemical denaturants; but, aside from the
tendency of the protein to aggregate, the denaturant alters
the interactions within the protein, and consequently one
studies a different system.
Simpliﬁed models can sample efﬁciently the confor-
mational space of small proteins and show that some
segments of lysozyme (1–25, 42–69 and 73–105) build
native contacts within each segment in the unfolded state,
but dock together only when they cross the transition state,
qualifying as LES. In fact, NMR experiments of reduced
lysozyme in water, in which case the disulphide bonds
which stabilize the native state are broken, indicate that
regions 19–32, 58–64, 106–116 and 119–124 are partially
structured in the unfolded state [23]. Circular dichroism
measurements of four peptides spanning the sequence of
lysozyme at pH 2 (in water) show that, while fragments
1–40, 41–60 and 61–82 appear to be unstructured, fragment
84–129 has considerable helical structure [24].
The importance of the experiments done with lysozyme
interacting with peptides displaying the same sequence as
segments of the protein itself is twofold. First, they are a
tool to investigate the unfolded state of a protein under
biological (i.e., non–denaturing) conditions. By means of
these peptides one can probe the assembly of the different
parts of the protein, locating the LES which are critical to
determine the folding pathway. Moreover, one can use the
p-LES, that is the peptides with the same sequence as a
LES, as an inhibitor or as a lead to design a peptidomi-
metic. This has been done with success, for example, in the
case of HIV-1 protease.
An interesting question is whether one can use any
easily available data to predict the LES of a protein without
the need of carrying out lengthy simulations or exhaustive
peptide screenings. Our results indicate that evolutionary
data and a proper analysis of how the stabilization energy

valuable information to locate the LES.
