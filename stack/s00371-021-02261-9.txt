Abstract
In this paper, a new method for image mosaicing (image stitching) is introduced based on Scale Invariant Feature trans-
form (SIFT). One of the main drawbacks of SIFT is the redundancy of the extracted keypoints, which leads to lower image 
mosaicing quality. Recently, a new method called Redundant Keypoint Elimination (RKEM) was presented to remove these 
redundant features, and enhance image registration performance. Despite the applicability of RKEM, its threshold value is 
considered the same in all parts of the image. This characteristic leads to inappropriate removal of keypoints due to the fact 
that distribution of keypoints in the high-detailed region is denser than the low-detailed ones. This paper proposes a new 
method to improve RKEM called Clustered RKEM (CRKEM) which is based on keypoints distribution. Moreover, in this 
paper a new blending algorithm is proposed based on a Gaussian-weighted function. In the proposed blending method, the 
Gaussian function is proposed based on the mean and variance of the pixels in the overlapped region of images to be mosi-
aced. In comparison with the classical methods, the experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed method in 
image mosaicing as well as to image registration and matching.

1  Introduction
Image mosaicing (image stitching) is the process of stitch-
ing two or more images together in order to create a larger, 
consistent and seamless composite image [1–4]. Image 
mosaicing is one of the most important and commonly used 
in the fields of image processing, machine vision, and com-
puter graphics, which has recently been the focus of many 
researchers [5–9]. Mosaicing process has many applica-
tions in image compression [10], image stabilization [11, 
12], medical image analysis [13], video indexing [14], pano-
ramic photography [15, 16], and mapping [17]. Although 
there are various methods for mosaicing images, the major-
ity of them are composed of three steps including feature 
extraction, image registration, image warping and blending 
[3, 18, 19]. In general, image mosaicing methods are divided 
into two categories: pixel-based (direct) methods [20–22] 
and feature-based methods [23–26]. In the direct methods, 
the information of the entire pixels of the image is used 
for mosaic image. Direct methods are good for mosaicing 
images with large overlap, translations, and small rotations 
[23, 27]. In the feature-based methods, image features are 
identified and then matching and homography between fea-
ture points are done. Feature-based methods are suitable for 
mosaicing images with little overlapping areas [27, 28]. In 
general, feature-based methods have more precision com-
pared to direct methods and are used more often in practical 
applications [29].
In feature-based methods, features are extracted from 
images in a variety of ways. In some methods, these fea-
tures are detected by deep neural networks [30, 31], and 
in some other methods, features are extracted by common 
feature detectors [32, 33]. Deep neural networks are com-
posed of three main layers: convolution, pooling and fully 
connected [34]. The features are identified by the convolu-
tion layer and these features are converted to the features 
vector by the pooling layer. Deep neural networks are widely

used in image processing [35–38], but these networks have 
weaknesses in feature extraction, including the incompre-
hensibility of image features physically, time consumin, and 
computational complexity [39]. These disadvantages have 
led to the continued attention to classical detectors in fea-
ture extraction. Feature-based detectors for image mosaicing 
are divided into two categories [40–43]: mosaicing images 
based on high-level features and low-level features. In the 
high-level feature algorithms, one part of the image (con-
tours) is identified as feature. In the low-level feature algo-
rithms, keypoints or corners are identified as features [44, 
45]. Typically, low-level feature algorithms are used more 
often for the image mosaicing process than high-level feature 
algorithms [2, 23, 29]. Low-level feature algorithms consist 
of two stages: identifying features and crating descriptors 
[46, 47]. At the feature identification stage, distinct positions 
of the image stable against different deviations (rotation, 
scale, affine, illumination) are extracted, and at the stage of 
creating descriptors, a descriptor is created for each identi-
fied feature using the specific area around each feature such 
as the gradient size, image information, texture, and edges. 
The most important and widely-used algorithm used in low-
level feature extraction is the Scale Invariant Feature Trans-
form (SIFT) algorithm [48, 49].
SIFT is a computer vision algorithm used to extract spe-
cific features of the images, and was originally proposed 
by David Lowe in 2004 at Columbia University, patented 
in the United States [32]. The features obtained from this 
algorithm are invariable against image scale and rotation 
as well as the change in the viewpoint, and the changes in 
intensity are partly fixed [50]. Despite the advantages men-
tioned, the algorithm has limitations that can reduce the 
image mosaicing process quality [51, 52]. Many studies 
have been conducted to solve the problems of this algorithm 
[53–64]. The PCA-SIFT algorithm has been introduced to 
reduce the size of the vector in the SIFT descriptor [53]. In 
this approach, the Principal Component Analysis is intro-
duced to reduce the size of the descriptors vector. In this 
algorithm, 128 dimensional SIFT descriptors are turned into 
a 40-dimensional vector, increasing the speed of the algo-
rithm performance and enhancing its performance in cases 
when images do not have much affine transformation. The 
Speed Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm is a resilient 
local feature detector that has been proposed to enhance 
the speed of SIFT, which is also constant against rotation 
and scale [54]. SURF uses fast measurement of the Hes-
sian matrix for the detector and distribution-based descrip-
tor. Although SURF performance is similar to SIFT, at a 
same time, SURF can operate faster. The N-Dimensional 
Scale Invariant Feature Transform (NSIFT) method has 
been presented to improve N-dimensional images match-
ing in SIFT [55]. This procedure is effective in the medical 
image matching that is three and four dimensional. Scale 
Restriction Scale Invariant Feature Transform) SRSIFT (has 
been introduced to reduce mismatches in SIFT [56]. This 
method eliminates some of the mismatches by modifying the 
keypoints gradient direction and scale limit standard lead-
ing to SIFT improvement in multi-modal remote sensing 
images. Auto-Adaptive SIFT ­(A2SIFT) has been proposed 
to improve SIFT over spatial distribution [57]. Affine SIFT 
(ASIFT) is the improved version of SIFT that is constant to 
affine deviations and much stronger against angle changes 
[58]. ASIFT extracts an impressive number of matching 
points in images, but often a large number of mismatches 
occur among them. The Iterative SIFT algorithm has been 
presented to reduce the number of features of SIFT [59]. 
Although this method can reduce the number of features and 
control the feature extraction step of SIFT but the distribu-
tion of keypoints in this method is not uniform. The Uniform 
Robust SIFT (UR-SIFT) algorithm has been introduced for 
more control over SIFT feature extraction [60]. RKEM-SIFT 
has been introduced to delete unnecessary keypoints in SIFT, 
the effectiveness of which in image registration [61], retinal 
image matching [63], and copy-move forgery detection [65] 
has been confirmed. In this algorithm, after identifying the 
keypoints according to the classic SIFT, in each image, the 
keypoint’s distance from each other is calculated first. After-
ward, when the distance between two different keypoints is 
less than a certain threshold value, the redundant keypoint 
is removed and the other one is maintained for the matching 
process. One of the major disadvantages of RKEM-SIFT 
is that it considers a single threshold value for the removal 
of redundant keypoints in all parts of the image regardless 
of the details of the image. In an image, one part may have 
many details and another part may have few details; a fixed 
threshold value in the whole image cannot lead to good 
results in the removal of redundant keypoints.
In this paper, to solve the mentioned problem of RKEM-
SIFT, a new method is proposed to find the appropriate 
threshold values based on the clustering approach. In this 
proposed method, after detecting the features by SIFT, based 
on the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm which is one 
the most applicable methods in data clustering, keypoints 
are placed in certain order clusters. Afterward, to remove 
redundant keypoints, according to the details of each region 
of the image, the appropriate threshold value is considered. 
The proposed Clustered Redundant Keypoint Elimination 
Method-SIFT (CRKEM-SIFT) can increase the matching 
precision and ultimately improves the performance of image 
mosaicing. Another innovation of the paper is the proposal 
of a new method in image blending. One of the major prob-
lems with classical methods is the combination of image 
artifacts and common lines. The Gaussian weight function is 
used in the proposed method of combining the mean and its 
variance, based on the mean and variance of the overlapped 
region, respectively.

The organization of the rest of paper is as follows. In 
Sect. 2, classical algorithms and their problems in image 
mosaicing are described, and in Sect. 3, the proposed 
approach is explained and in Sect. 4, we deal with the results 
of testing by different applications such as image matching, 
image registration, image mosaicing and change detection. 
Finally, the paper is concluded in Sect. 5.
2  Classical algorithms and their problems 
in image mosaicing
The image mosaicing process consists of three different 
steps according to Fig. 1. At first, the features of both input 
images are detected, and then the process of registration is 
done. Image registration refers to the geometric alignment of 
the image sets. Finally, image blending is carried out which 
modifies the image gray levels in the vicinity of a boundary 
to obtain a smooth transition between images by removing 
these seams and creating a blended image. RKEM-SIFT, 
and the common methods of blending such as the weighted 
average method [66], and ORB-improved blending [67] is 
described briefly, and finally the disadvantages of each of 
these algorithms are investigated in image mosaicing.
2.1  RKEM‑SIFT algorithm
RKEM-SIFT algorithm was introduced by Hossein-Nejad 
et al. in 2017 [61]. This algorithm is the improved form of 
SIFT algorithm in the feature extraction step. In this method, 
the features distance identified in the SIFT algorithm are 
calculated and proposed as the redundancy index criterion 
according to the distance between features. Then the fea-
tures distance which is less than the predetermined threshold 
value, the feature of the redundancy index of which is more 
than other features, is omitted.
2.2  RKEM‑SIFT problems
In an image, there are areas with many details, such as 
trees, and areas with least details such as the sky, the sea, 
where one of the problems of RKEM-SIFT method exits: 
in deletion of redundant keypoints, it does not pay atten-
tion to image details, so acting the same in all regions of 
the image. As shown in Fig. 2, image details at the bottom 
are more than those at the top of the image, so the number 
of the keypoints identified at the top of the image is less 
than those at the bottom. Finally, the distance between the 
keypoints is closer to the bottom of the image and there is 
even overlap in some areas. To remove features that overlap, 
attention should be paid to the image details because some 
of the features that are close to each other are not redundant 
in areas where there are many details. This problem men-
tioned in the RKEM-SIFT algorithm may interfere with the 
next processes, leading to problems such as the reduction in 
precision in image mosaicing. In the next section, we will 
examine the blending methods.

2.3  Blending algorithms
The process of image mosaicing requires to create an inte-
grated image without border-stitching after the registration 
stage. Image stitching is to create an image from blending 
of two or several other images so that their most important 
information is reserved and the boundaries of the images 
are not clear. The three common methods in image blending 
are the Weighted Average [21, 66], Wavelet Transform [68, 
69], and Spline Multi-resolution Method [70]. The Weight 
Average method is used most [67, 71]. Blending two images 
is presented according to Eq. (1), which provides various 
methods for calculating the amount 훽(x).
In this equation, IRef (x, y) and ITgt (x, y) are pixels in the 
reference image and the target image at the same location of 
the overlapping region.
In [66], the Weighted Average method is used for image 
blending, where 훽(x) is the cross-fade weighting function; 
its value is calculated according to Eq. (2).
In this equation, Xmin and xmax representing the left and right 
edge of a certain row in the overlapping region, respectively. 
The disadvantages of the weighted average method is the 
use of cross-fade function as this function creates artificial 
edges and blurring [67]. In [67] to solve the problem men-
tioned in the weighted average method, the Gaussian model 
is used instead of cross-fade function according to Eq. (3). 
The advantage of this method, is fewer artificial edges in the 
blended images. One of the disadvantages of this method 
[67] is the existence of boundary lines in the image.
In this equation, u and 2휎2 are obtained according to 
Eq. (4–5).
In this equation, Xmin and xmax represent the left and right 
edge of a certain row in the overlapping region, respectively.
2.4  Problems of blending methods
Each of image blending methods has some problems, each 
of which will be discussed below.

Most of the blended methods described shortly in the 
previous section are used to blend two images. However, 
normally more than two images are used to create panoramic 
images. Geometric adjustments, radiometric adjustments, 
altered imaging position, and changes in image texture and 
color cause problems in image blending. The most com-
mon problems are blurring of the image in common areas 
(Fig. 3a), artifacts (Fig. 3.b), boundary line in the blending 
area (Fig. 3c) and artificial edges (Fig. 3d).
3  Method
In this section, CRKEM-SIFT is proposed at the feature 
extraction stage and Gaussian-weighted blending function 
is proposed at the blending stage to improve image mosaic 
processes. The details of each method are as follows.
3.1  Proposed CRKEM‑SIFT method in feature 
extraction
The details of the proposed method are as follows.
Stage 0 A set of different images to be mosaicked is con-
sidered as the input to the algorithm.
Stage 1 The keypoints are identified in each image using 
SIFT.
Stage 2 For each keypoint of the image, one orientation is 
considered according to the classic SIFT [12].
Stage 3 The keypoints in each image are placed in m clus-
ters using the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm [46].
Stage 4 In each cluster, using Eq. (6), the number of each 
cluster’s keypoints (Nci) to the total detected keypoints in 
the image (Nt) is calculated. This value is considered as the 
threshold for each cluster. This threshold value is appropriate 
because the number of keypoints required for each cluster is 
identified by considering the image content in each cluster 
compared to the overall content of the image.
Stage 5 In each cluster, the Manhattan distance between 
each keypoint and other keypoints is calculated, respectively, 
according to Eq. (7).
In these Equation, pa (i) is the ith coordinate of the keypoint 
pa, pb (i) is the ith coordinate of the ­pb and k is the dimen-
sion of the keypoints. Then the total distance between each 
keypoint and other keypoints is calculated in each cluster 
according to Eq. (8).

In this equation, N is the number of keypoints in each cluster 
and d(pa, pj) is the distance between the keypoint pa and pj 
calculated according to Eq. (7).
Stage 6 If the Manhattan distance of two distinct key-
points is less than the threshold value obtained according 
to Eq. (6) in each cluster, we should eliminate one of the 
keypoints. Among these points, the keypoint, according 
to Eq. (9), whose redundancy is high is removed because 
Eq. (9) shows the amount of redundancy of the keypoints. 
The greater this amount is, the closer the keypoints are 
to one another.
Stage 7 at this stage, for each remaining keypoint of 
the image, a descriptor vector is computed according to 
the classic SIFT [12].

3.2  Proposed Gaussian‑weighted method 
in blending
Image blending is the mosaic final step to blend the pixels 
intensity in the overlapped region to avoid the seams. Image 
blending is used according to Eq. (10).
In this equation, IRef(x, y) and ITgt(x, y) are the pixels of the 
reference and target image in overlapping areas. 훽(x, y) is 
the Gaussian weighted function that gives a value to the 
pixel as weight according to the distance of the pixel to the 
boundary line. The Gaussian weighted function 훽(x, y) is 
according to Eq. (11).
(10)
I(x, y) = 훽(x, y)IRef(x, y) + (1 −훽(x, y))ITgt(x, y)

In these equations, xi is the data in the overlapping areas and 
n is the number of pixels in the overlapping areas.
4  Simulation results
In this section, a set of experiments in different applica-
tions is considered to assess the performance of the proposed 
CRKEM-SIFT method compared with SIFT [32], SURF 
[54], MSER-SIFT [72], RKEM-SIFT [61], ARKEM-SIFT 
[73], ORB-Weighted Mean method [67], AKAZE-MAC 
[3], SIFT-Voronoi Diagram [51], SURF-Multiband Blend-
ing [74], SIFT-weighted Average [75], SURF-LM [76], 
and SIFT-Improved Weighted Average [77]. In the first 
experiment series, effects of different threshold values on 
preservation of image details in RKEM and CRKEM-SIFT 
are investigated. In the second, the performance of the pro-
posed CRKEM-SIFT approach in the matching process is 
investigated. In the third and fourth sets, the performance 
of the proposed method in the applications of registration 
process and image mosaicing process are used, respectively. 
In these experiments, in order to prevent the selection of the 
parameters values from affecting the results, the algorithm 
parameters are selected constant. In the proposed algorithm 
of CRKEM-SIFT, the value of m which is the number of 
clusters is considered 3 and this number is considered exper-
imental. The amount of the parameter Tc is considered 0.01 
in order to extract the suitable number of features according 
to Lowe’s suggestion [32].
4.1  Image database
To assess the proposed method, it is necessary that the 
images be chosen in a way that include all distortions (differ-
ent scales, different viewpoints, different times and changes 
in rotation) between the images. To do so, the collection 
of images includes tree dataset, wall images downloaded 
from (www.​robots.​ox.​ac.​uk), bough images downloaded 
from (www.​robots.​ox.​ac.​uk), graffiti images downloaded 
from (http://​lear.​inria​lpes.​fr/​people/​mikol​ajczyk/​Datab​ase), 
building images downloaded from (https://​www.​mathw​orks.​
com), and Waterfall images.
4.2  Effects of different threshold values 
on preservation of image details in RKEM 
and CRKEM‑SIFT
In this experiment, an image was used to examine the 
removal of redundant keypoints and the performance of 
removing the redundant keypoints by RKEM-SIFT with dif-
ferent thresholds and the proposed CRKEM-SIFT is shown 
in Fig. 4.
As shown in Fig. 4b–f, by increasing the threshold value 
in the RKEM-SIFT method, more keypoints are considered 
as redundant points and eliminated. RKEM-SIFT does not 
pay attention to the details of the image to remove the redun-
dant keypoints, and in the part of the image that has a lot of 
details, the keypoints are removed in the same proportion 
as that of the part of the image with few details. It is shown 
in Fig. 4g with the proposed CRKEM-SIFT, much atten-
tion has been paid to the details of the image to remove the 
redundant keypoints, so that in the parts of the image where 
the details are many, more keypoints have been preserved. In 
general, RKEM-SIFT does not pay attention to the content 
and texture of the image removing redundant points, and 
uniformly removes keypoints that are closer than the pre-
determined threshold throughout the image. The proposed 
CRKEM-SIFT, on the contrary, pays attention to the con-
tent and texture of the image while removing the redundant 
points and adaptively removes fewer keypoints in parts of 
the image that have more content.
4.3  Experiment in the matching process
Matching is the process of determining correspondence 
between two or more images of the same scene received at 
different times, with different angles, or by different sensors. 
To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed CRKEM-
SIFT, a series of experiments with varied scales and view-
points is performed, and the resulting matching process is 
evaluated by the matching precision according to Eq. (12), 
feature repeatability rates according to Eq. (13), and the total 
number of matches.
In these equations, TP is the number of true matches and 
m is the total number of matches. Nref and Nsenc denote the 
total number of the detected features of the reference image 
and the target image, respectively. If the matching precision 
and feature repeatability rates are high, it has a better per-
formance in the matching process.
4.3.1  Matching process on images with varied scales
In this test, the "tree" dataset including images with differ-
ent scales is used, and the image matching performance is 
evaluated, which is shown in Fig. 5.
In Fig. 5, false matches are grouped by red squares 
based on the unnecessary SIFT keypoints, what indicates 
removal of redundant points using RKEM-SIFT, and

ARKEM-SIFT in addition to the improvement of matching 
precision by the proposed CRKEM-SIFT. The total num-
ber of matches is one of the important criteria. As seen in 
Fig. 4, the total number of matches in the ARKEM-SIFT 
method is much less than the proposed CRKEM-SIFT 
method. In ARKEM-SIFT, in order to remove the redun-
dant keypoints, the details of the image have not received 
attention, what has reduced the total number of matches, 
so it is important that the details of the image have been 
considered in the proposed CRKEM-SIFT method. Quan-
titative results obtained by different methods are given in 
Table 1, which shows the proposed CRKEM-SIFT per-
forms the best versus SIFT, SURF, MSER-SIFT, RKEM-
SIFT and ARKEM-SIFT in term of feature repeatability 
rate. In ARKEM-SIFT, the matching precision is more 
than the proposed CRKEM-SIFT, which does not indicate 
the proper performance of ARKEM-SIFT versus the pro-
posed CRKEM-SIFT. As the total number of matches in 
ARKEM-SIFT is significantly different from the proposed 
CRKEM-SIFT, the proposed CRKEM-SIFT is more robust 
to scale changes than the other methods.

4.3.2  Matching process on images with viewpoint changes
In this test, the "wall" dataset with different angles is 
used, and the matching performance in the proposed 
CRKEM-SIFT is evaluated, shown in Table 2.
In terms of the precision and repeatability metrics, 
RKEM-SIFT [61], ARKEM-SIFT [73] and specially the 
proposed CRKEM-SIFT, also have performed better than 
SIFT. The SURF method performs the worst among the 
other methods in two sets of experiments. It has obtained

4.4  Experiment on the image registration process
Image registration is the process of aligning two images from 
the same scene taken under various imaging situations [78]. 
To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed CRKEM-
SIFT, a series of tests on images with various rotations, 
scales, and viewpoints is performed, and the functionality 
of the proposed CRKEM-SIFT in the registration process 
is evaluated visually and by the RMSE criterion according 
to Eq. (14).
In this equation, (xi,yi) and (x′i, y′i) are the coordinates of the 
ith matching keypoint pair. If RMSE is relatively low, it has 
a better performance in image registration.

4.4.1  Registration process on images with different 
rotations and scales
In this experiment, seven pairs of the “bough” dataset which 
consist of images with changes rotation and scale are used, 
the performance results of which in the registration process 
are presented in Fig. 6.
As shown in Fig. 6, the proposed CRKEM-SIFT method 
has better performance than others. Performance of the reg-
istration process on a pair of images is shown in Fig. 7. As 
shown in this figure, CRKEM-SIFT has improved the reg-
istration process.
4.4.2  Registration process on images with viewpoint 
changes
In this experiment, the "graffiti" dataset which consists of 
images with different viewpoints is used, and the functional-
ity of the proposed CRKEM-SIFT in the registration process 
is evaluated, shown in Fig. 8.
Figure 8 and Table 3 show that alignment accuracy of 
the proposed CRKEM-SIFT compared to the others is more 
suitable.
4.5  Experiment on the image mosaicing process
In general, the image mosaicing process includes two impor-
tant steps: feature extraction and image blending. In this sec-
tion, to assess these two steps, first the proposed CRKEM-
SIFT method and then the proposed method (proposed 
CRKEM-SIFT and proposed blending method) for two and 
more image mosaicings are evaluated. Image mosaicing 
evaluation methods are divided into two categories: visual 
methods and objective methods. To evaluate the perfor-
mance of image mosaicing algorithms objectively, several 
articles have used the relationship between mosaicing and 
reference images, including the Median error (MEE), Max-
imum error (MAE) [79], and RMSE. On the other hand, 
overlapping areas are very important in mosaicing the image 
process. The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index [80], Peak 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) [3], Feature SIMilarity Index 
(FSIM) index [81] and Visual Saliency-Induced Index Vis-
ual saliency (VSI) [82] are overlapping criteria. The mecha-
nism for calculating these criteria is shown in Fig. 9.
4.5.1  Studying proposed CRKEM‑SIFT method in mosaicing 
process
To demonstrate the performance of the proposed CRKEM-
SIFT in the mosaicing process, a “Margoon waterfall1” data-
set which consists of images with different viewpoints is 
employed in this experiment (Fig. 10).
As shown in Table 4, the proposed method has obtained 
the highest alignment precision versus SIFT, RKEM-SIFT, 
ARKEM-SIFT, which denotes the proper performance of the

ing process has not shown a good performance by SURF, 
MSER-SIFT and ARKEM-SIFT. An example of improper 
performance of image mosaicing has been shown in Fig. 9 
with red squares, showing that it has not been able to mosaic 
the specified part properly.

4.5.2  Studying the proposed method for two‑image 
mosaicing
To demonstrate the performance of mosaicing process by the 
proposed method (proposed CRKEM-SIFT and proposed 
blending method), a dataset of the “underground city of 
Kariz2” which consists of images with different viewpoints 
is employed in this experiment (Fig. 11).
As shown in Fig. 11, some boundary lines can be seen by 
the results of ORB-Weighted Mean [67], AKAZE-MAC [3], 
SIFT-Voronoi Diagram [51] and SIFT-Improved Weighted 
Average [77]. In addition, parts of the image are not well 
stitched, indicating poor performance. By the proposed blend-
ing method, the blending process is well observed without any 
boundary lines.
As seen in Table 5, the proposed method has the highest 
value by the PSNR, SSIM, FSIM and VSI evaluation criteria 
and the lowest value by the MEE, RMSE and MAE evalua-
tion criteria, which indicates its successful performance in 
image mosaicing. Following the proposed method, based 
on PSNR, SSIM, FSIM and VSI evaluation criteria are 
AKAZE-MAC [3], SIFT-improved weighted average [77], 
SIFT-Voronoi diagram [51] and finally ORB-Weighted Mean 
[67] for success in image mosaicing, respectively.
4.5.3  Studying the proposed method for several images 
mosaicing process
In this experiment, a “building” dataset which consists of 
images with angle changes is used, the results of the mosa-
icing process on which are shown in Fig. 12. As it can be 
seen in this figure, the image mosaicing process by methods 
[74–77] have a large number of boundary lines (red squares 
in Fig. 12), but only one boundary line is shown in the pro-
posed method, indicating the effective performance of the 
proposed method. In the SIFT-Weighted Average method

5  Conclusion and future works
In this paper, a new approach for natural image mosaic-
ing process using a combination of two proposed methods 
CRKEM-SIFT and a Gaussian-Weighted blending method 
was introduced. At first, the features were extracted from 
the images using the proposed CRKEM-SIFT algorithm, 
which individually showed that the proposed CRKEM-
SIFT increased the matching precision and ultimately 
improved the performance of image mosaicing. Then, the 
mean and variance of the pixels of common areas were 
considered as the mean and variance in the Gaussian 
Weight function, showing the enhancement of the image 
blending. Therefore, the proposed method seems to be
