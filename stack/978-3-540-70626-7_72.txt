Feynman Diagrams
David Kaiser
Feynman diagrams are a powerful pictorial tool for making calculations in quantum
theory. They were invented by the American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman
(1918–88) during the late 1940s, in the context of  quantum electrodynamics
(QED), physicists’ quantum-mechanical theory of electric and magnetic forces. The
diagrams were intended to provide a shorthand for the famously unwieldy mathe-
matics of QED calculations, in which it had become common, since the 1930s,

for physicists to mistakenly conﬂate or omit terms within long series of expres-
sions. Feynman unveiled his new techniques at a private conference in 1948. He
also coached a young prot´eg´e, Freeman Dyson (born 1923, at that time a graduate
student at Cornell University in upstate New York, where Feynman taught), in how
to use the diagrams. Feynman and Dyson each published a pair of articles on the
new techniques during 1949 [1].
Feynman’s own route to the diagrams involved a major re-thinking of quantum
mechanics, based on his notion of  path integrals, which he developed for his
dissertation at Princeton University in 1942. Dyson, on the other hand, recognized
that the diagrams could be useful for calculations in  quantum ﬁeld theory in-
dependent of Feynman’s particular ideas about path integrals. Well into the 1960s,
most applications of Feynman diagrams, and most discussion of them in textbooks,
followed Dyson’s prescriptions, until Feynman’s path integrals entered the main-
stream [4,5].
As in any quantum-mechanicalcalculation, the main item of interest is a complex
number, or “amplitude,” whose absolute square yields a probability. For example,
A(t, x) might represent the amplitude that a particle will be found at a point x
at time t. Then the probability of ﬁnding the particle there at that time will be
|A(t, x)|2. (See  Born rule)
In QED, amplitudes are composed from a few basic ingredients, each of which
has an associated mathematical expression. Most often, the basic ingredients refer
to the behavior of virtual particles (see  QED) – particles that pop into existence
by “borrowing” energy from the vacuum, as long as they pay that energy back suf-
ﬁciently quickly, on timescales set by the  Heisenberg uncertainty principle. To
illustrate how the diagrams work, we may write, schematically:
• Amplitude for a virtual electron to travel undisturbed from spacetime point x to
spacetime point y: B(x, y);
• Amplitude for a virtual photon to travel undisturbed from spacetime point x to
spacetime point y: C(x, y);
• Amplitude for an electron and photon to scatter: eD.
Here e is the charge of the electron, which governs how strongly electrons and pho-
tons will interact, and we label coordinates as x = (t, x).
Feynman introduced his diagrams to keep track of all the different ways that
electrons and photons ( light quantum) could interact. The rules for using the dia-
grams are fairly straightforward: at every “vertex,” draw two electron lines meeting
one photon line. Draw all of the topologically distinct ways that electrons and pho-
tons can scatter (subject to this rule of always having two electron lines meet one
photon line). Then build an equation: substitute factors of B(x, y) for every virtual
electron line, C(x, y) for every virtual photon line, and eD for every vertex. Lastly,
because these vertices can occur anywhere in space and time, integrate over all the
spacetime points involving virtual particles.
The diagrammatic accounting scheme is so useful because e is so small: e2 ∼
1/137, in appropriate units. That means that diagrams that involve fewer ver-
tices – and hence fewer factors of this small number, e – tend to contribute more

to the overall amplitude than complicated diagrams, which contain many ver-
tices and hence many factors of e. Thus physicists can approximate an amplitude,
A, by expanding it in a series of progressively complicated terms, known as a
“perturbation-series expansion.” In principle the series includes an inﬁnite number
of distinct contributions – there are an inﬁnite number of different ways in which
virtual electrons and photons can scatter– but as a practical matter, physicists can
truncate the series at a desired level of accuracy.
For example, consider how an electron is scattered by an electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Quantum-mechanically, the ﬁeld can be described as a collection of photons. In the
simplest case, the electron (straight line) will scatter just once from a single photon
(dotted line) at just one vertex (circle at the point x0):
A(1)= eD
x0
In this case the electron is real, not virtual, and hence the only contribution comes
from the vertex.
Many more things can happen to the hapless electron. At the next level of
complexity, the incoming electron might shoot out a virtual photon before scat-
tering from the electromagnetic ﬁeld, reabsorbing the virtual photon at some other
point:
A(2)= e3 òDB(1,0) DB(0,2) DC(1,2)
x0
x1
x2
In this more complicated diagram, electron lines and photon lines meet in three
places, and hence the contribution to the overall amplitude from this diagram is
proportional to e3. Thus it is roughly one hundred times smaller in magnitude that
the contribution from the simplest diagram.
Still more complicated things can happen. At the next level of complexity, seven
distinct Feynman diagrams enter:

a
b
c
d
e
f
g
Each diagram – labeled a, b, c, and so on – will contribute a distinct term to
the overall amplitude. All seven of these contributions, deriving from diagrams
that contain ﬁve vertices, will be proportional to e5. As an example, consider the
contribution from the diagram labeled a at the upper left. We may label its contri-
bution A(3)a, meaning that this term enters at the third level of approximation, and
stems from diagram a:
x0
x1
x2
x3
x4
A(3)
a =e5òDB(1,0) DB(0,2) DC(1,3) D
 B(3,4) DB(4,3) C(4,2)
Similar terms can be written for each of the remaining diagrams at this level of ap-
proximation, leading to terms such as A(3)b, A(3)c, right through A(3)g. The total
amplitude for an electron to scatter from the electromagnetic ﬁeld may then be
written as the sum of all these terms:
A = A(1) + A(2) + A(3)a + A(3)b + A(3)c + . . .
and the probability for this interaction is |A|2.

Robert Karplus and Norman Kroll ﬁrst attempted this type of calculation using
Feynman’s diagrams soon after learning the new techniques from Dyson [2]. Eight
years later, several other physicists found a few algebraic errors in the calculation,
whose correction only affected the ﬁfth decimal place of the original answer. Since
the 1980s, Tom Kinoshita of Cornell University has gone all the way to diagrams
containing eight vertices – a calculation involving 891 distinct Feynman diagrams,
accurate to ten decimal places [3].
Although Feynman diagrams were developed as a tool for calculating the effects
of weakly-interacting forces (such as electromagnetism), the diagrams were quickly
adapted during the 1950s and 1960s to treat all kinds of other interactions, from
the strong nuclear force, to many-body interactions in condensed-matter physics, to
gravitation, and beyond [5]. They have become a ubiquitous element of the physi-
cist’s toolkit.
