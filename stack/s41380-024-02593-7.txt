Homo sapiens and Neanderthals underwent hybridization during the Middle/Upper Paleolithic age, culminating in retention of small
amounts of Neanderthal-derived DNA in the modern human genome. In the current study, we address the potential roles Neanderthal
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) may be playing in autism susceptibility in samples of black non-Hispanic, white Hispanic, and white
non-Hispanic people using data from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research (SPARK), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and
1000 Genomes (1000G) databases. We have discovered that rare variants are signiﬁcantly enriched in autistic probands compared to race-
matched controls. In addition, we have identiﬁed 25 rare and common SNPs that are signiﬁcantly enriched in autism on different ethnic
backgrounds, some of which show signiﬁcant clinical associations. We have also identiﬁed other SNPs that share more speciﬁc genotype-
phenotype correlations but which are not necessarily enriched in autism and yet may nevertheless play roles in comorbid phenotype
expression (e.g., intellectual disability, epilepsy, and language regression). These results strongly suggest Neanderthal-derived DNA is
playing a signiﬁcant role in autism susceptibility across major populations in the United States.

BACKGROUND
DNA evidence taken from human remains from the Middle
Pleistocene indicate that anatomically modern humans (AMH) and
other archaic humans underwent multiple introgression events
[1]. Of those archaic humans, Homo neanderthalensis (Nean-
derthals) has received the most attention, providing the most
fossil material and occupying the position as our closest known
cousin on the hominin tree of life. It has been estimated that
Eurasian-derived populations have approximately 2% Neanderthal
DNA, which was acquired during introgression events occurring
shortly after AMH migrated out of Africa [2, 3]. These hybridization
events occurred somewhere between 47–65 thousand years ago
(kya) [4]. A subset of Europeans later immigrated back into Africa
approximately 20 kya, bringing some of this Neanderthal ancestry
with them, such that all modern Africans have a small but
measurable amount of Neanderthal DNA from the event [5].
With
the
recent
sequencing
of
multiple
archaic
human
genomes, there has been growing interest concerning the
inﬂuence of archaic human-derived alleles on modern health
[6, 7]. With regards to Neanderthal-derived variants, previous
groups have identiﬁed positive selection on genes relating to
immune function, skin and hair pigmentation, physiological
responses to high altitude conditions, aspects of metabolism,
hypercoagulation, and propensity for depression [6, 8].
In general, dosage-sensitive genes are tightly conserved and
resistant to such introgression events [9, 10]. Most genes involved in
brain development follow this dosage-sensitive pattern and have
tended to be resistant to introgression [11]. In support of this,
Srinivasan et al. [12] found a depletion of Neanderthal-derived
variants within autism- and other brain-related genes in the general
population. On the other hand, other studies have reported a number
of non-synonymous and other single nucleotide variants within
neural genes that have been implicated in the condition [3, 13].
Additional research involving non-clinical populations has
identiﬁed strong links between certain brain and skull morphol-
ogies and enrichment of Neanderthal DNA [14, 15]. Speciﬁcally,
enrichment is associated with reduced globularity in the skull
shape of modern populations, a ﬁnding mildly reminiscent of the
elongated skull morphology characteristic of Neanderthal and
other archaic crania [15]. Enrichment of Neanderthal DNA is also
associated with enhanced neural connectivity within visual
processing systems, particularly between the intraparietal sulcus
(IPS) and the occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, and decreased
connectivity within the default mode (social) network [14, 16].
Importantly, many of these same connectivity patterns are
recapitulated in autism, which is a major impetus for the current
work. For instance, underconnectivity within the default mode
network is consistently reported in autism [17]. Meanwhile,
increased connectivity within visual processing networks is also
a commonly reported feature. Keehn et al. [18] tested autistic
children1 using a visual search task in which this group tends to
excel. They identiﬁed an “island of sparing” in autism reﬂected in
increased connectivity within occipital regions and enhanced

connectivity of these visual processing areas to the frontal lobes.
Autistic people also often have cognitive strengths in areas such
as mathematics. Iuculano et al. [20] found that during numerical
problem solving, autistic children had greater activation in the
fusiform gyrus and occipital lobes compared to non-autistic
children, again suggesting that visual processing modalities are an
area of strength in autism. Interestingly, many of these features
are shared by non-clinical groups with high Neanderthal DNA
content [14, 15].
In light of this evidence, in the current study we addressed
whether Neanderthal DNA is enriched in autistic people and their
siblings compared to ethnically-matched controls. We accessed
whole exome sequencing (WES) for autistic probands and
unaffected siblings from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism
Research (SPARK) Database [21] for comparison against individuals
in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and 1000 Genomes
(1000G) databases [22, 23]. Signiﬁcant enrichment in the autism
group was especially driven by rare Neanderthal-derived variants,
but also some common variants, which suggests weak but
ongoing purifying selection towards removal of some of these
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from the human genome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
An assemblage of Neanderthal-derived SNPs was provided by the
Sankararaman laboratory and has been previously published [7, 24]. Only
European-speciﬁc SNPs were used in the current study due to European
admixture across these various ethnic groups. The authors applied for and
received access to WES from the SPARK dataset (Clemson University
IRB2018-235), which is a collection of extensive genotype and clinical data
on autistic individuals and their unaffected siblings [21]. Samples have
been collected from a wide range of collection sites within the US and can
be found on the SFARI website (see: https://www.sfari.org/resource/spark/).
Only individuals of self-reported “white” (white Hispanic, white non-
Hispanic) and “black” (black non-Hispanic) backgrounds were used in these
analyses; any participant listed as “admixed” was removed. Autistic
individuals with potential confounding genetic and environmental factors
were also excluded from the study. These conditions include: congenital
anomalies, birth or pregnancy complications, premature birth, fetal alcohol
syndrome, and cognitive delays due to exposure or medical condition.
Ethnically matched controls were accessed from the GTEx Project (Clemson
University IRB2022-0589) for comparison with the black non-Hispanic and
white non-Hispanic SPARK groups respectively. Unfortunately, GTEx
includes too small of a sample (<2%) of Hispanic individuals for adequate
comparison, so these were removed from the GTEx sets and a different
control group was used for white Hispanics in the SPARK group [25]. For
white Hispanics, the Mexican (MXL) and Puerto Rican (PUR) ancestry
subgroups from 1000G were used as controls— data that are freely
available for download [23]. According to the Pew Research Center, people
of Mexican ancestry currently compose about 60% of all Hispanics within
the mainland US, while Puerto Ricans compose another 9% [26]. Together,
these two groups of Hispanics compose the largest subset of Hispanic
people in the mainland US and are available in 1000G, and for this reason
these subgroups have been selected to approximate a control group,
utilizing a 1:6 (PUR : MXL) ratio in order to best mimic the Pew data.
Allelic frequencies were determined using ethnically matched control
groups. While numbers of white non-Hispanic exomes were sufﬁcient
(GTEx N = 706, SPARK affected = 2004, SPARK unaffected siblings = 172),
the number of black non-Hispanic SPARK affected and GTEx individuals
were comparatively small (SPARK N = 72, GTEx N = 102), which limited our
analysis of this latter subset (see Table 1 for basic demographics). In
addition, the white Hispanic control group was similarly limited (N = 74),
which has likely affected the Rare NeanderScore results, creating the
appearance of an even greater divergence than probably exists; therefore,
these results should be interpreted with some caution. All SNPs with
missing data were removed from the analyses due to signiﬁcant
ﬂuctuations in results when even small amounts of missing data were
retained (e.g., even a 5% threshold for missing data dramatically altered
results with the current study design). After removal of 546 SNPs with
missing data, this left a total of 1288 SNPs for comparison across all groups.
To process the genotype calls from SPARK, GTEx, and 1000G VCFs, the
individual genotypes were converted into a binary call format (bcf) using
bcftools (see: https://github.com/samtools/bcftools). Subsequently, the bcf
ﬁles were transformed into genotype matrices using the JVARKIT tools
developed by Pierre Lindenbaum. The JVARKIT tools can be found at the
following GitHub repository (see: https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/).
Autism SNPs were categorized as “rare” (<1%) and “common” (≥1%),
according to their frequency within the respective GTEx/1000G control
datasets [27] (see Fig. 1A for rare-to-common SNP ratios by ethnic control
group). Across all groups, homozygous ancestral (non-Neanderthal) SNPs
were assigned a value of “0,” heterozygous Neanderthal SNPs were given a
value of “1,” and homozygous Neanderthal alleles assigned the value of
“2.” Raw NeanderScores were then calculated according to the average of
these values per individual (divided by total possible SNPs, e.g., 1288 for
Total NeanderScores) and larger group averages were subsequently
broken down into the rare and common categories for additional analysis.
The term, “NeanderScore,” is used here to refer to the average SNP
enrichment in any given individual, with “Rare, “Common,” and “Total”
NeanderScores referring to averages across groups of SNPs with varying
frequencies. For instance, a given individual’s “Rare NeanderScore” within
the white non-Hispanic group is calculated by tallying the total number of
hits
per
person
(0
=
homozygous
ancestral,
1
=
heterozygous
Neanderthal, 2 = homozygous Neanderthal) across the 348 rare SNPs
and then averaged by dividing with the total number of possible hits (i.e.,
348). This provides a percentage of enrichment, which, along with other
individuals’ Rare NeanderScores, can then be used to determine group
means and variance for comparison.
For enrichment analyses, all SNPs enriched by ≥5% in either the black
non-Hispanic or white non-Hispanic autism groups relative to controls, or
enriched by ≥10% in the white Hispanic autism group, were selected for
additional investigation. Although these cutoffs are somewhat arbitrary,
the white Hispanic cutoff was set higher relative to the other two ethnic
groups due to greater deviation between white Hispanic autism and
control data, which is likely due to poorer match of the control group and
therefore we felt warranted a more conservative cutoff (see Fig. 1B). SNPs
that achieved these cutoffs were statistically analyzed for enrichment
relative to controls using two-proportion Z tests with Benjamini-Hochberg
(BH) multitest correction. Finally, all SNPs that retained signiﬁcance after
correction but were not expressed in brain according to GTEx’s Locus
Browser (Variant-centric), which allows visualization of QTLs by tissue type,
were also removed. This resulted in a ﬁnal list of 6 brain-related QTLs in 5
host genes that were signiﬁcantly enriched in the black non-Hispanic
autism group, 18 SNPs in 15 host genes in the white Hispanic group, and 1
SNP in the white non-Hispanic group (25 in total). Gene consequences
were derived from dbSNP [28]. Using NIH’s LDexpress tool, a list of host
genes with SNPs in signiﬁcant linkage disequilibrium in brain with our 25
SNPs of interest was also produced [29]. The standard settings were used,
which included a window of 500k bp and R2 > 0.1, and all brain-related
tissues were selected prior to search, such as “Brain – Cortex,” “Brain –
Cerebellum,” etc. For each of the 6 SNPs enriched in black non-Hispanics,
African Ancestry in Southwest USA (ASW) was used as a population
background, as not all SNP pairings share LD on all genetic backgrounds.
Meanwhile, both the MXL and PUR populations were used as a combined
background for the 18 white Hispanic SNPs. And, ﬁnally, Northern
Europeans from Utah (CEU) were used as background for white non-
Hispanics. This resulted in a list of 43 host genes with additional brain-
related QTLs of potential interest.
The original 25 SNPs were then analyzed for clinical associations
available via the SPARK dataset. All other rare SNPs not signiﬁcantly
enriched in the autism groups were also assessed for clinical associations
using t-tests/Mann-Whitney U tests and ANCOVAs, as they may still play

important roles in comorbid clinical phenotypes despite a lack of relative
enrichment compared to controls. Only SNPs that were brain-related QTLs
were retained for the production of the genotype-phenotype Cytoscape
network.
Finally, all rare SNPs enriched (not necessarily signiﬁcantly) in our
respective autism groups were analyzed for various functional enrichment
patterns (e.g., Gene Ontology, KEGG Pathway, REAC, transcription factor
binding sites) using the g:Proﬁler platform, which provides a list of
signiﬁcant enrichment terms as well as FDR-adjusted p-values [30].
Statistics
For NeanderScores that followed a normal distribution, parametric
statistics were used (i.e., t-test, ANOVA), with standard post hoc comparison
when appropriate. Meanwhile, for datasets that were skewed (Shapiro-
Wilk) or displayed unequal variances (Levene’s), nonparametric analyses
such as Mann-Whitney U, Welch t-test, and Kruskal-Wallis were used, with
Games-Howell post hoc comparison when appropriate. For binomial data
(e.g., presence/absence), Chi-square and odds ratios were used. For
covariates such as “Language Regression x Epilepsy,” ANCOVAs were used.
Means and standard deviations for each analysis are available in the
Supplementary Materials, as are all statistical analyses. Analyses were
conducted and plots produced using R and Cytoscape, the former with the
ggplot2 package.
RESULTS
Within the present work, “NeanderScore” refers to an average of
the Neanderthal DNA content within a given person’s genome,
calculated based on the total number of Neanderthal-derived
SNPs surveyed [7, 24]. NeanderScores were further divided into
“Rare” and “Common” for additional analyses. All NeanderScores
for the current study were calculated using only genic content and
did not analyze intergenic regions.
Total NeanderScores differed signiﬁcantly between ethnic
groups as expected, with NeanderScores highest in white Hispanic
people, followed by white non-Hispanics, and ﬁnally black non-
Hispanics (H = 525.172, p = 2.939 × 10−111, η2 = 0.532] (Fig. 1B).
However, according to posthoc analysis, Total NeanderScores did
not differ between black non-Hispanic and white non-Hispanic
experimental
and
control
groups,
although
white
Hispanic
controls had signiﬁcantly higher Total NeanderScores than their
SPARK counterparts, which may be a reﬂection of small control
numbers (p = 0.004) (Supplementary Materials - Table 1).
Rare SNPs occur, by deﬁnition, in less than 1% of the general
population, while common in ≥1% of the population [27]. Within
each ethnic grouping, SNPs were broken down into these two
categories (rare and common) according to their frequency within
the GTEx or 1000G control groups and analyzed accordingly.
Utilizing this approach, we investigated potential enrichment of
common
Neanderthal-derived
SNPs
in
our
autism
groups
compared to ethnically matched controls. Both the black non-
Hispanic and white Hispanic autism groups exhibited signiﬁcantly
lower Common NeanderScores (i.e., had fewer common Nean-
derthal variants) (black non-Hispanic: W = 4617.500, p = 0.004;
white Hispanic: t(88.520) = −4.355, p = 3.568 ×10-5). Meanwhile,
autistic white non-Hispanics and their sibs did not signiﬁcantly
differ from the control group nor each other (F(2, 2879) = 2.225,
p = 0.108) (Fig. 1C) (Supplementary Materials - Table 2).
In contrast to Total and Common NeanderScores, it was apparent
there was a dramatic enrichment of rare SNPs in all SPARK groups
compared to ethnically matched controls (black non-Hispanics:
H = 1767.500, p = 5.308 × 10−9; white Hispanic: X2 = 281.994,
OR = 7.624, 95% CI (4.809, 10.440), p = 3.511 × 10−61; white non-
Hispanic post hoc: t = −3.997, pTukey = 1.940 × 10−4) (Fig. 1D).

According to Standard post hoc comparisons, white non-Hispanic
autistic people did not signiﬁcantly differ from sibs (ptukey = 0.746)
and sibs did not signiﬁcantly differ from controls (pTukey = 0.354) as
their scores hovered midway between the other two groups
(Supplementary Materials - Table 3). Unfortunately, sibling numbers
were too low in the other two ethnic groups to enable similar
comparisons. Lastly, sex was not a signiﬁcant predictor of rare SNP
enrichment within the various autism groups (p = 0.271–0.830),
although males in general tended to have higher scores.
In order to further test the validity of the rare SNP categorization,
we performed a randomization test on white non-Hispanic rare
SNPs as this autism group displayed the smallest divergence from
controls. The difference of the means of Rare NeanderScores
between autism and controls was 1.086 × 10−3. After 10,000
randomized repetitions, the average difference of the means was
4.191 × 10−6, which is signiﬁcantly less than the observed difference
(p = 1.000 × 10−4), indicating that the original result was not
obtained at random and lends further support to these results.
Following these analyses, we performed functional enrichment
studies on rare SNPs enriched (though not necessarily signiﬁ-
cantly) in each autism group using the g:Proﬁler platform. Across
all three ethnic groups, terms relating to “cytoskeleton” and/or
“cell projection” were over-represented in the rare enriched genes
(see Table 2). Within the white Hispanic rare genes, terms such as
“nervous system development” and “neurogenesis” were also
over-represented.
We next investigated signiﬁcant enrichment of speciﬁc SNPs
across the different ethnic groups. A total of 6 SNPs in the black
non-Hispanic autism group, 18 SNPs in the white Hispanic group,
and 1 SNP in the white non-Hispanic group were signiﬁcantly
enriched relative to controls and, according to the GTEx’s Variant-
centric Locus Browser, are brain-associated QTLs (see Table 3,
Supplementary Materials - Table 4). Numbers of black non-
Hispanic sibs were too small for analysis; however, white Hispanic
sibs showed a similar enrichment as their affected siblings and did
not signiﬁcantly differ from each other with the exception of a
single SNP (rs117034642), which was even higher in unaffected
sibs (Z = −2.776, BH adj. p = 0.049). There was no enrichment
difference between autistics and sibs regarding the single
enriched SNP in the white non-Hispanic group (Z = 0.759,
p = 0.447). These 25 SNPs were then fed into NIH’s LDexpress
tool, which resulted in a further 43 host genes containing brain-
related QTLs in signiﬁcant LD with our original SNPs of interest.
Interestingly, within the white Hispanic autism group, there was a
notable enrichment, not only of heterozygous variants in the 18
SNPs overrepresented in this group, but of homozygous variants
as well (heterozygous: W = 17,822.500, p = 2.146 × 10−13; homo-
zygous: W = 13,761.000, p = 1.878 × 10−4). Regarding the single
SNP enriched in white non-Hispanics, this same trend was not
seen (p = 0.174). This analysis was not performed on the black
non-Hispanic
group
as
none
of
the
6
SNPs
occurred
in
homozygous form in this group.
Following these analyses, we investigated additional clinical
associations connected with Rare NeanderScores. Initially, we
looked at relationships between the different autism-related
diagnoses denoted within the SPARK database. Rare Neander-
Scores signiﬁcantly differed by diagnosis in the white non-
Hispanic group [F(3, 2000) = 2.665, p = 0.046], although none of
the diagnostic groups signiﬁcantly differed from each other in
Standard post hoc comparison (p = 0.156-0.996), making this result
difﬁcult to interpret. The other two ethnic groups did not
signiﬁcantly
differ
in
this
way
(black
non-Hispanic:
F(3,
68) = 2.241,
p = 0.091;
white
Hispanic:
F(3,
308) = 1.915,
p = 0.127). We then performed additional analyses investigating
relationships between enriched SNPs that are brain-related QTLs
and autism comorbidities. Only one SNP (rs112406029, SLC37A1
host gene) in particular survived multitest correction in the white
non-Hispanic group (BH adj. p = 0.012) and was signiﬁcantly
associated with epilepsy, occurring in 39% of that sample
compared to 26% in non-epileptics and 22% in controls (Fig. 1E,
Table 4). In fact, approximately 8% of white non-Hispanic autistic
people with seizures were homozygous for this variant, compared
to 1.5% in those without epilepsy (X2 = 17.842, p = 2.400 × 10−5).
The rs112406029 enrichment was even more dramatic when
family type (multiplex vs. simplex) was added as a covariate [F(1,
1905) = 11.055, p = 9.014 × 10−4]. Sixty-seven percent of multi-
plex individuals with epilepsy carried at least one copy of this
variant, while 25% of those were homozygous (Table 4, Fig. 1E).
Additional clinical associations turned up in the other ethnic
groups as well. For instance, in the black non-Hispanic autism
group, the rs1805327 missense variant in the RAD1 host gene,
which is enriched in this group in general, is over-represented in
multiplex
cases
with
language
regression
(F(1,
66) = 8.766,
p = 0.004; post hoc: pTukey = 0.010–0.025). This is in contrast to
an inverse relationship between overall Rare NeanderScore and
language regression in autistic black non-Hispanics: individuals
with higher Rare NeanderScores are signiﬁcantly less likely to
experience language regression (W = 348, BH adj. p = 0.012). In
autistic white Hispanics, almost 80% of males with epilepsy carried
the rs2307073 synonymous variant within the epilepsy-associated
USP47 host gene, compared to ~1/3rd of other autistic cases and
15% in the matched controls [F(1, 308) = 9.494, p = 0.002; post
hoc: pTukey = 0.008-0.045) [31]. This particular SNP shares LD with
additional SNPs within the DKK3 host gene, which is also
implicated in the black non-Hispanic group and is involved in
regulation of canonical Wnt signaling [32]. (See Supplementary
Materials -Table 5 for full statistical results).
We
extended
this
analysis
by
investigating
relationships
between clinical phenotypes and rare SNPs by group—particularly
those SNPs that are brain-related QTLs. While there were no single
phenotype/SNP pairings that survived multitest correction, there
were a number of comorbid phenotypes that exhibited signiﬁcant
associations with particular rare SNPs (Fig. 1E, Table 4). A notable
example includes the rs20756613 SNP within the ONECUT1 host

gene in the white non-Hispanic group and its association with
epilepsy and various other clinical features, such as intellectual
disability (ID) and language delay. The rs4487571 variant in the
TFEB host gene, which is a transcription factor that acts as a master
regulator of a variety of metabolic and immune pathways, is
enriched in white Hispanics with language regression and
epilepsy. Finally, the rs73038782 variant in the A2ML1 host gene,
an inhibitor of various proteases and linked with some cases of
Noonan syndrome, is enriched in black non-Hispanics from
multiplex families without ID [33]. (See Supplementary Materials
- Table 6 for full statistical results).
DISCUSSION
Neanderthals experienced a prolonged genetic bottleneck, lead-
ing to greater retention of nonsynonymous mutations within their
dwindling population, suggesting some of these variants may still
be represented in the human genome today [34]. Juric et al. [35]
found that these weakly deleterious variants, though retained in
Neanderthals as a result of small population size, have been under
purifying selection once they entered the H. sapiens background
with access to a larger population. In support, Wei et al. [36]
reported Neanderthal variants are signiﬁcantly depleted in the
modern genome relative to alleles matched for frequency and
linkage disequilibrium.
Here we report an enrichment of a subset of rare and common
Neanderthal-derived polymorphisms in autism across three major
ethnic groups (black non-Hispanic, white Hispanic, and white non-
Hispanic). The low frequency of some of these SNPs, along with
their clinical associations, suggests they are weakly deleterious
and under continued purifying selection. These trends are not,
however, accompanied by a general enrichment in overall
Neanderthal content in the SPARK groups, which suggests that
not
all
Neanderthal-derived
DNA
is
equally
implicated
in
susceptibility.
Neanderthal-derived variants in other neurodevelopmental
conditions
Previous
studies
have
investigated
the
potential
roles
of
Neanderthal DNA in susceptibility to other neurodevelopmental
conditions. For instance, Gregory et al. [37] reported that lower
NeanderScores are associated with schizophrenia and, in parti-
cular, with the positive symptoms often present in the condition,
suggesting Homo sapiens-speciﬁc variants, rather than Nean-
derthal, may be playing a role in susceptibility to the condition.
We would point out, however, that these ﬁndings do not
necessarily disagree with the current study. For instance, the
present autism samples are not necessarily enriched in all
frequency types of Neanderthal variants studied. While white
Hispanic autistic people have a dramatic enrichment of rare
variants, they have lower total NeanderScores compared to
ethnically matched controls. A similar trend is seen in this group
and black non-Hispanics when calculating common Neander-
Scores, i.e., variants that occur in ≥1% in controls. We are,
therefore, proposing that a select subset of Neanderthal-derived
variants are playing roles in autism susceptibility and other
comorbid features, such as ID, epilepsy, and language regression.
It would be interesting to determine whether a subset of
Neanderthal-derived SNPs might not be playing similar roles in
schizophrenia susceptibility, despite lower overall NeanderScores.
Along a similar line of research, Srinivasan et al. [12] identiﬁed
lower rates of Neanderthal Selective Sweeps (Neanderthal variant-
enriched regions) in portions of the genome that are over-
represented by brain-related genes implicated in schizophrenia.
However, it has previously been recognized that brain-related
genes, including major effect genes implicated in autism, are
tightly conserved and generally mutation intolerant as a result of
dosage
sensitivity
[38].
A
similar
immutability
is
seen
in
schizophrenia-related genes [39]. Therefore, one would expect
genomic introgression to be underrepresented in such regions
following events such as hybridization. However, even small
numbers of key variants in such genes, as a result of their relative
intolerance, may nevertheless be keenly felt. In addition, it is vital
to understand the contexts under which Homo sapiens-speciﬁc
variation
occurred.
Hybridization
in
non-human
species
is
recognized as a destabilizing event with the potential to promote
compensatory adaptation in other regions of the genome and,
ultimately, speciation in some lineages [40]. Therefore, there is an
additional possibility that Homo sapiens-speciﬁc variants that
evolved after Neanderthal introgression may nevertheless be
inﬂuenced by these earlier events.
Neanderthal DNA, Social Cognition, & Visual Processing
The
roles
that
some
Neanderthal-derived
variants
play
in
connectivity within the intraparietal sulcus and their concomitant
inﬂuence on social abilities and visual processing have implica-
tions for some of the clinical features of autism. Given the results
of the current study, some may ask whether features of autism are
reminiscent
of
behaviors
seen
in
Neanderthal
people.
Of
relevance, recent evidence from numerous individuals from the
Altai Mountains of southern Siberia has shown that their genomes
held long segments of homozygosity, indicative of small breeding
pools [41]. From these and other data, the authors make
inferences about Neanderthals’ social organization, reinforcing
previous notions that they likely lived in small communities
(reviewed in [41]). Previous studies have found that social group
size of a primate species is strongly predictive of overall
neocortical size, suggesting links between group size and
cognitive function [42, 43]. While Neanderthals appear to have
maintained more regional patterns of social interaction, early
European AMH seem to have engaged in broader, better-
integrated social networks [44]. An interesting topic for future
research is whether Neanderthal-derived sociobehavioral tenden-
cies may be reﬂected in some people on the autism spectrum (a
topic colloquially known as the “Neanderthal Theory of Autism”)
[45].
Conversely, individuals on the autism spectrum often exhibit
strengths in visuospatial processing [17, 19]. While an extensive
array of tool-making techniques is associated with AMH in the
Upper Paleolithic, it should be noted that the Levallois technique,
which is most associated with Neanderthal societies in the Middle
Paleolithic, is thought to require more skill and training than those
necessary to produce the later Upper Paleolithic blades, indicating
that Neanderthals were indeed capable of exceptional craftsman-
ship [46]. Recent research has also revealed additional decorative
artistry in Neanderthal societies, with evidence of the use of ﬂight
feathers
culled
from
birds
of
prey
for
probable
personal
adornment, as well as early examples of cave art [47, 48]. Relevant
to the ﬁelds of paleoanthropology and paleoarcheology, there are
numerous examples of autistic savants with exceptional visuos-
patial
abilities
(e.g.,
artistic
ability)
who
nevertheless
have
signiﬁcant challenges with verbal communication, suggesting
that the use of visual symbolism in ancient humans is not
necessarily an adequate proxy for presumed language ability as
these are modular functions.
Pertinent to the topic of autistic abilities and savantism,
although most studies on autism genomics focus on the
deleterious nature of variants, there is the possibility some of
these autism-associated Neanderthal SNPs have been under weak
positive selection. In support, recent studies have identiﬁed
genetic variants implicated in both autism and high intelligence
[49]. Meanwhile, autistic people often perform better on tests of
ﬂuid intelligence than neurotypicals [50]. The variable penetrance
of these Neanderthal variants for autism, as evidenced by similar
patterns
of
enrichment
in
unaffected
siblings,
as
well
as
enrichment of some common variants, suggest a means for their
R. Pauly et al.

retention. In further support, studies on the cognitive ability of
unaffected siblings show sibs tend to have higher performance IQ
scores relative to verbal IQ – a pattern very similar to affected
siblings and different from neurotypicals [51]. In addition, families
of students studying disciplines like math, physics, and engineer-
ing are more likely to have autistic family members than students
studying the humanities, suggesting an extended cognitive
phenotype exists [52].
Of potential relevance to this topic, paleoarcheologists have
identiﬁed an “Upper Paleolithic Revolution” beginning around 50 kya,
which was a change in the ways AMH made tools, traveled and
engaged in trade, used and produced artistic materials, and
structured their living habitats, such as dividing the home into food
preparation, discard, cooking, and sleeping areas [53]. Interestingly,
this time period roughly coincides with hybridization between H.
sapiens and Neanderthals, suggesting hybridization may have been a
stimulus for cognitive change, one which may continue to inﬂuence
intellectual ability and susceptibility to neurodevelopmental condi-
tions in modern humans. This has been hypothesized before,
although from a sociocultural rather than a genetics perspective [54].
Further work is needed to address these possibilities.
Limitations
Despite strong clinical associations reported here, analyzing large
numbers of SNPs gives the viewer only a gross perspective of
potential roles Neanderthal-derived SNPs may be playing in
autism susceptibility. While a subset of variants may be playing
complex roles in susceptibility, there is much noise surrounding
this genic signal and the current work would beneﬁt in future
from greater magniﬁcation of networks of SNPs potentially driving
these results.
There are additional limitations we believe may have restricted
or inﬂuenced the current results. The ﬁrst concerns limitations
within some of the clinical data made available in the SPARK
database, most notably the lack of ASD levels (1-3), which
subsequently limited our ability to address potential enrichment
differences and SNP associations by severity level (although data
on comorbid ID were made available, as were pre-DSM-5
diagnoses).
Another
limitation
concerns
issues
surrounding
personalized medicine and population genetics: while there is
an ever-growing array of population-based genomic material
made
available
for
research,
the
genetic
backgrounds
of
subpopulations can vary signiﬁcantly from different collection
sites even across identical self-reported ethnic labels. In addition,
despite ethnic labels, humans are often signiﬁcantly admixed,
which can inﬂuence these types of studies. This emphasizes the
importance not only of continued efforts to identify ethnic
backgrounds
genetically
and
to
rely
less
on
self-reported
identiﬁcation for the purposes of genetics studies, but to also
stress the importance of collecting non-clinical control data from
the same clinical sites as the experimental groups, which may help
reduce background variability within these self-reported labels.
Related to this, it was challenging to acquire an appropriate ethnic
control match for white Hispanics within the SPARK dataset, which
we suspect has likely led to the insertion of noise within the
results. In future iterations of this research, we will be utilizing
admixture analysis rather than relying solely on self-reported
labels for group assignment.
The
ﬁnal
limitation
concerns
previous
research
on
the
Neanderthal genome. While Neanderthal introgression has indeed
been conﬁrmed across multiple studies through a variety of
algorithms, it has nevertheless been challenging to differentiate
introgression from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the latter due
to
common
ancestry
and
not
hybridization.
Unfortunately,
methods parsing introgression from ILS tend to have poor
speciﬁcity at the SNP level [55]. Therefore, it is possible that some
of the SNPs reported in the present work may be a result of ILS
rather than hybridization and may instead be shared by a deeper
human ancestry, which holds interesting possibilities regarding
human
brain
evolution
itself.
Future
studies
utilizing
new
algorithms will undoubtedly continue to improve on the available
data and provide better clarity regarding these questions.
CONCLUSION
This is the ﬁrst study to provide strong evidence for the active role
of a subset of rare, as well as some common, Neanderthal-derived
alleles in autism susceptibility in multiple major American
populations. We hope this research will lead to further investiga-
tion into the ongoing inﬂuences of ancient hybridization between
H. sapiens and Neanderthals in brain development, human
intelligence, and overall human health, as well as spur work into
additional clinical resources for this complex population.
