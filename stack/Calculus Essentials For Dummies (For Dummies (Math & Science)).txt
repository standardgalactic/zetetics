Introduction
T
he mere thought of having to take a required calculus 
course is enough to make legions of students break out in 
a cold sweat. Others who have no intention of ever studying 
the subject have this notion that calculus is impossibly diffi-
cult unless you happen to be a direct descendant of Einstein.
Well, I’m here to tell you that you can master calculus. It’s not 
nearly as tough as its mystique would lead you to think. Much 
of calculus is really just very advanced algebra, geometry, and 
trig. It builds upon and is a logical extension of those subjects. 
If you can do algebra, geometry, and trig, you can do calculus. 
Read this jargon-free book, get a handle on calculus, and join 
the happy few who can proudly say, “Calculus? Oh, sure, I know 
calculus. It’s no big deal.”
About This Book
Calculus Essentials For Dummies is intended for three groups 
of readers: students taking their first calculus course, students 
who need to brush up on their calculus to prepare for other 
studies, and adults of all ages who’d like a good introduction 
to the subject. For those who’d like a fuller treatment of the 
subject, check out Calculus For Dummies.
If you’re enrolled in a calculus course and you find your text-
book less than crystal clear, Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
is the book for you. It covers the two most important topics 
in the first year of calculus: differentiation and integration.
If you’ve had elementary calculus, but it’s been a couple of 
years and you want to review the concepts to prepare for, 
say, some graduate program, Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
will give you a quick, no-nonsense refresher course.
Nonstudent readers will find the book’s exposition clear and 
accessible. Calculus Essentials For Dummies takes calculus out 
of the ivory tower and brings it down to earth.

2
Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
This is a user-friendly math book. Whenever possible, I explain 
the calculus concepts by showing you connections between 
the calculus ideas and easier ideas from algebra and geometry. 
I then show you how the calculus concepts work in concrete 
examples. Only later do I give you the fancy calculus formulas. 
All explanations are in plain English, not math-speak.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions keep the text consistent and oh-so-
easy to follow.
 
✓ Variables are in italics.
 
✓ Calculus terms are italicized and defined when they first 
appear in the text.
 
✓ In the step-by-step problem-solving methods, the general 
action you need to take is in bold, followed by the specif-
ics of the particular problem.
Foolish Assumptions
Call me crazy, but I assume . . . 
 
✓ You know at least the basics of algebra, geometry, and trig.
 
 If you’re rusty, you might want to brush up a bit on these 
pre-calculus topics. Actually, if you’re not currently 
taking a calculus course, and you’re reading this book 
just to satisfy a general curiosity about calculus, you can 
get a good conceptual picture of the subject without the 
nitty-gritty details of algebra, geometry, and trig. But you 
won’t, in that case, be able to follow all the problem solu-
tions. In short, without the pre-calculus stuff, you can see 
the calculus forest, but not the trees. If you are enrolled 
in a calculus course, you’ve got no choice — you’ve got 
to know the trees. 
 
✓ You’re willing to do some w_ _ _ .
 
 No, not the dreaded w-word! Yes, that’s w-o-r-k, work. I’ve 
tried to make this material as accessible as possible, but it 
is calculus after all. You can’t learn calculus by just listen-
ing to a tape in your car or taking a pill — not yet anyway.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
Keep your eyes on the icons:
 
Next to this icon are the essential calculus rules, definitions, 
and formulas you should definitely know.
 
These are things you need to know from algebra, geometry, or 
trig, or things you should recall from earlier in the book.
 
The bull’s-eye icon appears next to things that will make your 
life easier. Take note.
 
This icon highlights common calculus mistakes. Take heed.
 
In contrast to the Critical Calculus Concepts, you generally 
don’t need to memorize the fancy-pants formulas next to this 
icon unless your calc teacher insists.
Where to Go from Here
Why, Chapter 1, of course, if you want to start at the begin-
ning. If you already have some background in calculus or just 
need a refresher course in one area or another, then feel free 
to skip around. Use the table of contents and index to find 
what you’re looking for. If all goes well, in a half a year or so, 
you’ll be able to check calculus off your bucket list:
 
___ Run a marathon
 
___ Go skydiving
 
___ Write a book
 
_x_ Learn calculus
 
___ Swim the English Channel
 
___ Cure cancer
 
___ Write a symphony
 
___ Pull an inverted 360° at the X-Games
For the rest of your list, you’re on your own. 


Chapter 1
Calculus: No Big Deal
In This Chapter
▶ Calculus — it’s just souped-up regular math
▶ Zooming in is the key
▶ Delving into the derivative: It’s a rate or a slope
▶ Investigating the integral — addition for experts
I
n this chapter, I answer the question “What is calculus?” in 
plain English and give you real-world examples of how it’s 
used. Then I introduce you to the two big ideas in calculus: 
differentiation and integration. Finally, I explain why calculus 
works. After reading this chapter, you will understand what 
calculus is all about.
So What Is Calculus Already?
Calculus is basically just very advanced algebra and geometry. 
In one sense, it’s not even a new subject — it takes the ordi-
nary rules of algebra and geometry and tweaks them so that 
they can be used on more complicated problems. (The rub, of 
course, is that darn other sense in which it is a new and more 
difficult subject.)
Look at Figure 1-1. On the left is a man pushing a crate up a 
straight incline. On the right, the man is pushing the same 
crate up a curving incline. The problem, in both cases, is to 
determine the amount of energy required to push the crate to 
the top. You can do the problem on the left with regular math. 
For the one on the right, you need calculus (if you don’t know 
the physics shortcuts).

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
6
For the straight incline, the man pushes with an unchang-
ing force, and the crate goes up the incline at an unchanging 
speed. With some simple physics formulas and regular math 
(including algebra and trig), you can compute how many calo-
ries of energy are required to push the crate up the incline. 
Note that the amount of energy expended each second 
remains the same.
Regular math problem
Calculus problem
Figure 1-1:  The difference between regular math and calculus: 
In a word, it’s the curve.
For the curving incline, on the other hand, things are con-
stantly changing. The steepness of the incline is changing — 
and it’s not like it’s one steepness for the first 3 feet and then 
a different steepness for the next 3 — it’s constantly changing. 
And the man pushes with a constantly changing force — the 
steeper the incline, the harder the push. As a result, the 
amount of energy expended is also changing, not just every 
second or thousandth of a second, but constantly, from one 
moment to the next. That’s what makes it a calculus problem. 
It should come as no surprise to you, then, that calculus is 
called “the mathematics of change.” Calculus takes the regular 
rules of math and applies them to fluid, evolving problems.
For the curving incline problem, the physics formulas remain 
the same, and the algebra and trig you use stay the same. The 
difference is that — in contrast to the straight incline prob-
lem, which you can sort of do in a single shot — you’ve got to 
break up the curving incline problem into small chunks and 
do each chunk separately. Figure 1-2 shows a small portion of 
the curving incline blown up to several times its size.

 Chapter 1: Calculus: No Big Deal
7
Calculus problem
Figure 1-2: Zooming in on the curve — voilà, it’s straight (almost).
When you zoom in far enough, the small length of the curving 
incline becomes practically straight. Then you can solve that 
small chunk just like the straight incline problem. Each small 
chunk can be solved the same way, and then you just add up 
all the chunks.
That’s calculus in a nutshell. It takes a problem that can’t 
be done with regular math because things are constantly 
changing — the changing quantities show up on a graph as 
curves — it zooms in on the curve till it becomes straight, 
and then it finishes off the problem with regular math. 
What makes calculus such a fantastic achievement is that it 
does what seems impossible: it zooms in infinitely. As a matter 
of fact, everything in calculus involves infinity in one way or 
another, because if something is constantly changing, it’s 
changing infinitely often from each infinitesimal moment to 
the next.
Real-World Examples of Calculus 
So, with regular math you can do the straight incline problem; 
with calculus you can do the curving incline problem. With 
regular math you can determine the length of a buried cable 
that runs diagonally from one corner of a park to the other 
(remember the Pythagorean Theorem?). With calculus you 
can determine the length of a cable hung between two towers 
that has the shape of a catenary (which is different, by the 
way, from a simple circular arc or a parabola). Knowing the 
exact length is of obvious importance to a power company 
planning hundreds of miles of new electric cable.

You can calculate the area of the flat roof of a home with regu-
lar math. With calculus you can compute the area of a compli-
cated, nonspherical shape like the dome of the Minneapolis 
Metrodome. Architects need to know the dome’s area to 
determine the cost of materials and to figure the weight of the 
dome (with and without snow on it). The weight, of course, is 
needed for planning the strength of the supporting structure.
With regular math and simple physics, you can calculate how 
much a quarterback must lead a pass receiver if the receiver 
runs in a straight line and at a constant speed. But when NASA, 
in 1975, calculated the necessary “lead” for aiming the Viking I 
at Mars, it needed calculus because both the Earth and Mars 
travel on elliptical orbits, and the speeds of both are con-
stantly changing — not to mention the fact that on its way to 
Mars, the spacecraft was affected by the different and con-
stantly changing gravitational pulls of the Earth, moon, Mars, 
the sun. See Figure 1-3.
Regular math problem:
What's the proper lead for
hitting the receiver?
Failure to complete this
pass is no big deal.
Calculus problem:
What's the proper "lead" for
"hitting" Mars?
Failure to complete this
"pass" is a big deal.

Differentiation
Differentiation is the first big idea in calculus. It’s the process 
of finding a derivative of a curve. And a derivative is just the 
fancy calculus term for a curve’s slope or steepness.

 Chapter 1: Calculus: No Big Deal
9
In algebra, you learned the slope of a line is equal to the ratio 
of the rise to the run. In other words, 
. In Figure 1-4, 
the rise is half as long as the run, so segment AB has a slope of  
1/2. On a curve, the slope is constantly changing, so you need 
calculus to determine its slope.

B
Figure 1-4: Calculating the slope of a curve isn’t as simple as rise over run.
The slope of segment AB is the same at every point from A to B. 
But the steepness of the curve is changing between A and B. At 
A, the curve is less steep than the segment, and at B the curve 
is steeper than the segment. So what do you do if you want the 
exact slope at, say, point C? You just zoom in. See Figure 1-5.

Figure 1-5: Zooming in on the curve.
When you zoom in far enough — actually infinitely far — the 
little piece of the curve becomes straight, and you can figure the 
slope the old-fashioned way. That’s how differentiation works.
Integration
Integration, the second big idea in calculus, is basically just 
fancy addition. Integration is the process of cutting up an area

into tiny sections, figuring out their areas, and then adding 
them up to get the whole area. Figure 1-6 shows two area 
problems — one that you can do with geometry and one 
where you need calculus.

Figure 1-6:  If you can’t determine the area on the left, hang up your  calculator.
The shaded area on the left is a simple rectangle, so its area, of 
course, equals length times width. But you can’t figure the area 
on the right with regular geometry because there’s no area for-
mula for this funny shape. So what do you do? Why, zoom in, 
of course. Figure 1-7 shows the top portion of a narrow strip of 
the weird shape blown up to several times its size.

Figure 1-7:  For the umpteenth time: When you zoom in, curves become 
straight.
When you zoom in, the curve becomes practically straight, 
and the further you zoom in, the straighter it gets — with 
integration, you actually zoom in infinitely close, sort of. You 
end up with the shape on the right in Figure 1-7, an ordi-
nary trapezoid — or a triangle sitting on top of a rectangle. 
Because you can compute the areas of rectangles, triangles, 
and trapezoids with ordinary geometry, you can get the area 

 Chapter 1: Calculus: No Big Deal 11
of this and all the other thin strips and then add up all these 
areas to get the total area. That’s integration.
Why Calculus Works
The mathematics of calculus works because curves are locally 
straight; in other words, they’re straight at the microscopic 
level. The earth is round, but to us it looks flat because we’re 
sort of at the microscopic level when compared to the size 
of the earth. Calculus works because when you zoom in and 
curves become straight, you can use regular algebra and 
geometry with them. This zooming-in process is achieved 
through the mathematics of limits.
Limits: Math microscopes
The mathematics of limits is the microscope that zooms in 
on a curve. Say you want the exact slope or steepness of the 
parabola 
 at the point (1, 1). See Figure 1-8.

Figure 1-8: The parabola 
 with a tangent line at (1, 1).
With the slope formula from algebra, you can figure the slope 
of the line between (1, 1) and (2, 4) — you go over 1 and up 3, 
so the slope is 3/1, or 3. But you can see in Figure 1-8 that this 
line is steeper than the tangent line at (1, 1) that shows the 
parabola’s steepness at that specific point. The limit process 
sort of lets you slide the point that starts at (2, 4) down toward 
(1, 1) till it’s a thousandth of an inch away, then a millionth, 
then a billionth, and so on down to the microscopic level. If 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
12
you do the math, the slopes between (1, 1) and your moving 
point would look something like 2.001, 2.000001, 2.000000001, 
and so on. And with the almost magical mathematics of limits, 
you can conclude that the slope at (1, 1) is precisely 2, even 
though the sliding point never reaches (1, 1). (If it did, you’d 
only have one point left and you need two separate points to 
use the slope formula.) The mathematics of limits is all based 
on this zooming-in process, and it works, again, because the 
further you zoom in, the straighter the curve gets.
What happens when you zoom in
Figure 1-9 shows three diagrams of one curve and three things 
you might like to know about the curve: 1) the exact slope or 
steepness at point C, 2) the area under the curve between A 
and B, and 3) the exact length of the curve from A to B. You 
can’t answer these questions with regular math because the 
regular math formulas for slope, area, and length work for 
straight lines (and simple curves like circles), but not for 
weird curves like this one.
The first row of Figure 1-10 shows a magnified detail from the 
three diagrams of the curve in Figure 1-9. The second row 
shows further magnification. Each magnification makes the 
curves straighter and straighter and closer and closer to the 
diagonal line. This process is continued indefinitely.
Finally, the bottom row of Figure 1-10 shows the result after 
an “infinite” number of magnifications — sort of. You can 
think of the lengths 3 and 4 in the bottom row of rectangles as 
3 and 4 millionths of an inch, no, make that 3 and 4 billionths 
of an inch, no, trillionths, no, gazillionths, . . . .

After zooming in “forever,” the curve is perfectly straight, and 
now regular algebra and geometry formulas work.
For the diagram on the left in Figure 1-10, you can now use 
the regular slope formula from algebra to find the slope at 
point C. It’s exactly 3/4 — that’s the answer to the first ques-
tion in Figure 1-9. This is how differentiation works.
For the diagram in the middle, the regular triangle formula from 
geometry gives an area of 6. So to get the total shaded area in 
Figure 1-9, you add the area of the thin rectangle under this tri-
angle (the thin strip in Figure 1-9 shows the basic idea), repeat 
this process for all the other narrow strips, and then just add 
up all the little areas. This is how regular integration works.
For the diagram on the right, geometry’s Pythagorean theo-
rem gives you a length of 5. Then to find the total length of the 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies

curve from A to B in Figure 1-9, you do the same thing for the 
other minute sections of the curve and then add up all the 
little lengths. This is how you calculate arc length (another 
integration problem).
Well, there you have it. Calculus uses the limit process to 
zoom in on a curve till it’s straight. After it’s straight, the rules 
of regular-old math apply. Calculus thus gives ordinary alge-
bra and geometry the power to handle complicated problems 
involving changing quantities (which on a graph show up as 
curves). This explains why calculus has so many practical uses, 
because if there’s something you sure can count on — in addi-
tion to death and taxes — it’s that things are always changing.

imits are fundamental for both differential and integral 
calculus. The formal definition of a derivative involves a 
limit as does the definition of a definite integral. 
Taking It to the Limit
 
The limit of a function (if it exists) for some x-value, a, is the 
height the function gets closer and closer to as x gets closer 
and closer to a from the left and the right.
Let me say that another way. A function has a limit for a given 
x-value if the function zeroes in on some height as x gets 
closer and closer to the given value from the left and the 
right. It’s easier to understand limits through examples than 
through this sort of mumbo jumbo, so take a look at some.
Three functions with one limit
Consider the function 
 in Figure 2-1. When we 
say that the limit of 
 as x approaches 2 is 5, written as 
, we mean that as x gets closer and closer to 2 
from the left and the right, 
 gets closer and closer to a 
height of 5. (As far as I know, the number 2 in this example 
doesn’t have a formal name, but I call it the x-number.) Look 
at Table 2-1.

In Table 2-1, y is approaching 5 as x approaches 2 from both 
the left and the right, and thus the limit is 5. But why all the 
fuss with the numbers in the table? Why not just plug the 
number 2 into 3x – 1 and obtain the answer of 5? In fact, if all 
functions were continuous (without gaps) as in Figure 2-1, you 
could just plug in the x-number to get the answer, and limit 
problems would basically be pointless. 
We need limits in calculus because of functions like the ones 
in Figure 2-1 that have holes. g is identical to f except for the 
hole at (2, 5) and the point at (2, 3). h is identical to f except 
for the hole at (2, 5).
Imagine what the table of input and output values would look 
like for g and h. Can you see that the values would be identi-
cal to the values in Table 2-1 for f? For both g and h, as x gets 
closer and closer to 2 from the left and the right, y gets closer 
and closer to a height of 5. For all three functions, the limit as 
x approaches 2 is 5.

 Chapter 2: Limits and Continuity 17
This brings us to a critical point: When determining the limit 
of a function as x approaches, say, 2, the value of the function 
when x = 2 is totally irrelevant. Consider the three functions 
where x = 2: 
 equals 5, 
 is 3, and 
 doesn’t exist (is 
undefined). But, again, those three results are irrelevant and 
don’t affect the answer to the limit problem.
 
In a limit problem, x gets closer and closer to the x-number but 
technically never gets there, and what happens to the function 
when x equals the x-number has no effect on the answer to the 
limit problem (though for continuous functions like f the func-
tion value equals the limit answer and it can thus be used to 
compute the limit answer).
One-sided limits
One-sided limits work like regular, two-sided limits except 
that x approaches the x-number from just the left or just the 
right. To indicate a one-sided limit, you put a superscript 
subtraction sign on the x-number when x approaches the 
x-number from the left or a superscript addition sign when x 
approaches it from the right:
Look at Figure 2-2. The answer to the regular limit problem, 
, is that the limit does not exist because as x approaches
3 from the left and the right, 
 is not zeroing in on the same 
height.

: An illustration of two one-sided limits.

18
However, both one-sided limits do exist. As x approaches 
3 from the left, p zeros in on a height of 6, and when x 
approaches 3 from the right, p zeros in on a height of 2. As 
with regular limits, the value of 
 has no effect on the 
answer to either of these one-sided limit problems. Thus,
Limits and vertical asymptotes
A rational function like 
 has vertical 
asymptotes at x = 3 and x = –1. Remember asymptotes? 
They’re imaginary lines that a function gets closer and closer 
to as it goes up, down, left, or right toward infinity. f is shown 
in Figure 2-3.
Consider the limit of f as x approaches 3. As x approaches 3 
from the left, f goes up to infinity; and as x approaches 3 from 
the right, f goes down to negative infinity. Sometimes it’s infor-
mative to indicate this by writing,

 Chapter 2: Limits and Continuity 19
But it’s also correct to say that both of the above limits do not 
exist because infinity is not a real number. And if you’re asked 
to determine the regular, two-sided limit, 
, you have to 
say that it does not exist because the limits from the left and 
from the right are unequal.
Limits and horizontal asymptotes
Up till now, I’ve been looking at limits where x approaches 
a regular, finite number. But x can also approach infinity or 
negative infinity. Limits at infinity exist when a function has a 
horizontal asymptote. For example, the function in Figure 2-3 
has a horizontal asymptote at y = 1, which the function crawls 
along as it goes toward infinity to the right and negative infin-
ity to the left. (Going left, the function crosses the horizontal 
asymptote at x = –7 and then gradually comes down toward 
the asymptote.) The limits equal the height of the horizontal 
asymptote and are written as
Instantaneous speed
Say you decide to drop a ball out of your second-story window. 
Here’s the formula that tells you how far the ball has dropped 
after a given number of seconds (ignoring air resistance):
(where h is the height the ball has fallen, in feet, and t is the 
amount of time since the ball was dropped, in seconds)
If you plug 1 into t, h is 16; so the ball falls 16 feet during the 
first second. During the first 2 seconds, it falls a total of 
, 
or 64 feet, and so on. Now, what if you wanted to determine 
the ball’s speed exactly 1 second after you dropped it? You 
can start by whipping out this trusty ol’ formula:

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
20
 
Using the rate, or speed formula, you can easily figure out the 
ball’s average speed during the 2nd second of its fall. Because 
it dropped 16 feet after 1 second and a total of 64 feet after 2 
seconds, it fell 64 – 16, or 48 feet from t = 1 second to t = 2 sec-
onds. The following formula gives you the average speed:
But this isn’t the answer you want because the ball falls faster 
and faster as it drops, and you want to know its speed exactly 
1 second after you drop it. The ball speeds up between 1 and 
2 seconds, so this average speed of 48 feet per second during 
the 2nd second is certain to be faster than the ball’s instanta-
neous speed at the end of the 1st second. For a better approxi-
mation, calculate the average speed between t = 1 second and 
t = 1.5 seconds. After 1.5 seconds, the ball has fallen 
, 
or 36 feet, so from t = 1 to t = 1.5, it falls 36 – 16, or 20 feet. Its 
average speed is thus
If you continue this process for elapsed times of a quarter of a 
second, a tenth, a hundredth, and so on, you arrive at average 
speeds shown in Table 2-2.

As t gets closer and closer to 1 second, the average speeds 
appear to get closer and closer to 32 feet per second.
Here’s the formula I used to generate the numbers in 
Table 2-2. It gives you the average speed between 1 second 
and t seconds. Figure 2-4 shows the graph of this function.

 Figure 2-4: The average speed function.
This graph is identical to the graph of the line y = 16t + 16 
except for the hole at (1, 32). There’s a hole there because if 
you plug 1 into t in the average speed function, you get
which is undefined. And why did you get ? Because you’re 
trying to determine an average speed — which equals total 
distance divided by elapsed time — from t = 1 to t = 1. But from 
t = 1 to t = 1 is, of course, no time, and “during” this point in 
time, the ball doesn’t travel any distance, so you get 
 as the average speed from t = 1 to t = 1. 
Obviously, there’s a problem here. Hold on to your hat — 
you’ve arrived at one of the big “Ah ha!” moments in the 
development of differential calculus.
 
Instantaneous speed is defined as the limit of the average 
speed as the elapsed time approaches zero.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
22
The fact that the elapsed time never gets to zero doesn’t 
affect the precision of the answer to this limit problem — the 
answer is exactly 32 feet per second, the height of the hole in 
Figure 2-4. Remarkably, limits let you calculate precise, instan-
taneous speed at a single point in time by taking the limit of 
a function that’s based on an elapsed time, a period between 
two points of time.
Limits and Continuity
A continuous function is simply a function with no gaps — a 
function that you can draw without taking your pencil off the 
paper. Consider the four functions in Figure 2-5.
Whether or not a function is continuous is almost always obvi-
ous. The first two functions in Figure 2-5 — f and g — have no 
gaps, so they’re continuous. The next two — p and q — have 
gaps at x = 3, so they’re not continuous. That’s all there is to it. 
Well, not quite. The two functions with gaps are not continuous 
everywhere, but because you can draw sections of them with-
out taking your pencil off the paper, you can say that parts of 
them are continuous. And sometimes a function is continuous 
everywhere it’s defined. Such a function is described as being 
continuous over its entire domain, which means that its gap or 
gaps occur at x-values where the function is undefined. The 
function p is continuous over its entire domain; q, on the other 
hand, is not continuous over its entire domain because it’s not 
continuous at x = 3, which is in the function’s domain.
Continuity and limits usually go hand in hand. Look at x = 3 on 
the four functions in Figure 2-5. Consider whether each function 
is continuous there and whether a limit exists at that x-value. 
The first two, f and g, have no gaps at x = 3, so they’re continu-
ous there. Both functions also have limits at x = 3, and in both 
cases, the limit equals the height of the function at x = 3, because 
as x gets closer and closer to 3 from the left and the right, y gets 
closer and closer to 
, respectively.

Figure 2-5: The graphs of the functions f, g, p, and q.
Functions p and q, on the other hand, are not continuous at 
x = 3 (or you can say that they’re discontinuous there), and 
neither has a regular, two-sided limit at x = 3. For both func-
tions, the gaps at x = 3 not only break the continuity, they 
also cause there to be no limits there because, as you move 
toward x = 3 from the left and the right, you do not zero in on 
some single y-value.
So continuity at an x-value means there’s a limit for that 
x-value, and discontinuity at an x-value means there’s no limit 
there . . . except when . . . (read on).
The hole exception
The hole exception is the only exception to the rule that con-
tinuity and limits go hand in hand, but it’s a huge exception. 
And, I have to admit, it’s a bit odd for me to say that continu-
ity and limits usually go hand in hand and to talk about this 
exception because the exception is the whole point. When you 
come right down to it, the exception is more important than 
the rule. Consider the two functions in Figure 2-6.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
24
These functions have gaps at x = 2 and are obviously not con-
tinuous there, but they do have limits as x approaches 2. In 
each case, the limit equals the height of the hole. 
 
An infinitesimal hole in a function is the only place a function 
can have a limit where it is not continuous.
So both functions in Figure 2-6 have the same limit as x 
approaches 2; the limit is 4, and the facts that 
 and 
that 
 is undefined are irrelevant. For both functions, as 
x zeroes in on 2 from either side, the height of the function 
zeroes in on the height of the hole — that’s the limit.
 
The limit at a hole is the height of the hole.

In the earlier “Instantaneous speed” section, I tried to calcu-

in the function. Function holes often come about from the 
impossibility of dividing zero by zero. It’s these functions 
where the limit process is critical, and such functions are at 
the heart of the meaning of a derivative, and derivatives are at 
the heart of differential calculus. 
 
A derivative always involves the undefined fraction  and 
 
always involves the limit of a function with a hole. (All 
the limits in Chapter 4 — where the derivative is formally 
defined — are limits of functions with holes.)

Plug-and-chug limits
Plug-and-chug problems make up the second category of easy 
limits. Just plug the x-number into the limit function, and if 
the computation results in a number, that’s your answer. For 
example,
This method works for limits involving continuous functions 
and functions that are continuous over their entire domains. 
These are well-duh limit problems, and, to be perfectly frank, 
there’s really no point to them. The limit is simply the function 
value.
 
The plug-and-chug method works for any type of function 
unless there’s a discontinuity at the x-number you plug in. In 
that case, the number you get after plugging in is not the limit. 
 
And if you plug the x-number into a limit like 
 and you 
 
get any number (other than zero) divided by zero — like 
 — 
then you know that the limit does not exist.
“Real” Limit Problems
If you plug the x-number into the limit expression and the result 
is undefined (usually ), you’ve got a “real” limit problem — 
and some work to do. In this chapter, you learn algebraic tech-
niques for solving these “real” limit problems.
You use two main algebraic techniques for “real” limit problems: 
factoring and conjugate multiplication. I lump other algebra 
techniques in the section “Miscellaneous algebra.” All algebraic 
methods involve the same basic idea. When substitution doesn’t 
work in the original function — usually because of a hole in the 

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Limits 27
function — you can use algebra to manipulate the function until 
substitution does work (it works because your manipulation 
plugs the hole).
Factoring
Here’s an example. Evaluate

stitution first.

 can be factored, so do it.
 
 
 
3. Cancel the (x – 5) from the numerator and 
 denominator.
 
 
 
4. Now substitution will work.
 
 
The function you got after canceling the (x – 5), namely (x + 5), 
is identical to the original function, 
, except that the 
hole in the original function at (5, 10) has been plugged. Note 
that the limit as x approaches 5 is 10, which is the height of the 
hole at (5, 10).
Conjugate multiplication
Try this method for fraction functions that contain square 
roots. Conjugate multiplication rationalizes the numerator or 
denominator of a fraction, which means getting rid of square 
roots. Try this one: Evaluate 
.
 
1. Try substitution.
 
 Plug in 4: that gives you  — time for plan B.

 Now do the rationalizing.
 
 
 
3. Cancel the (x – 4) from the numerator and 
 denominator.
 
 
 
4. Now substitution works.
 
 
As with the factoring example, this rationalizing process 
plugged the hole in the original function. In this example, 4 is 
the x-number,  is the answer, and the function 
 has a 
hole at

Miscellaneous algebra
When factoring and conjugate multiplication don’t work, try 
other basic algebra like adding or subtracting fractions, multi-
plying or dividing fractions, canceling, or some other form of 
simplification. 
Evaluate

1. Try substitution.
 
 Plug in 0: That gives you  — no good.
 
2. Simplify the complex fraction (that’s a big fraction 
that contains little fractions) by multiplying the

numerator and denominator by the least common 
denominator of the little fractions, namely 4(x + 4). 
 
 Note: Adding or subtracting the little fractions in the 
numerator or denominator also works in this type of 
problem, but it’s a bit longer than the method here.
 
 
 
3. Now substitution works.
 
 
Limits at Infinity
In the limits in the last section, x approaches a finite number, 
but there are also limits where x approaches infinity or nega-
tive infinity. Consider the function 
. See Figure 3-1.

You can see on the graph (in the first quadrant) that as x gets 
bigger and bigger — in other words, as x approaches infinity — 
the height of the function gets lower and lower but never gets 
to zero. This is confirmed by considering what happens when 
you plug bigger and bigger numbers into . The outputs get 
smaller and smaller. This graph thus has a horizontal asymp-
tote of y = 0 (the x-axis), and we say that 
. The fact that 
x never actually reaches infinity and that f never gets to zero 
has no relevance. When we say that 
, we mean that as 
x gets bigger and bigger without end, f gets closer and closer 
to zero. The function f also approaches zero as x approaches 
negative infinity, written as 
.
Horizontal asymptotes
Horizontal asymptotes and limits at infinity go hand in hand — 
you can’t have one without the other. For a rational function 
like 
, determining the limit at infinity or negative 
infinity is the same as finding the location of the horizontal 
asymptote.
Here’s what you do. First, note the degree of the numera-
tor (that’s the highest power of x in the numerator) and the 
degree of the denominator. You’ve got three cases:
 
✓ If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree 
 
 of the denominator, for example 
, 
 
 there’s no horizontal asymptote and the limit of the func-
tion as x approaches infinity (or negative infinity) does 
not exist.
 
✓ If the degree of the denominator is greater than the 
 
 degree of the numerator, for example 
, 
 
 the x-axis (the line y = 0) is the horizontal asymptote and 
.
 
✓ If the degrees of the numerator and denominator are 
 
 equal, take the coefficient of the highest power of x in the 
numerator and divide it by the coefficient of the highest 
power of x in the denominator. That quotient gives you 
the answer to the limit problem and the height of

Substitution doesn’t work for the problems in this section. 
If you try plugging  into x in any of the rational functions in 
this section, you get

Solving limits at infinity
Let’s try some algebra for the problem

1. Try substitution — always a good idea.
 
 No good. You get

and which tells you nothing (see the related Warning 
in the previous section). On to plan B.
 
 Because

 conjugate multiplication method seems like a natural 
choice, except that that method is used for fraction 
 
 functions. Well, just put

Now do the conjugate multiplication.

ifferential calculus is the mathematics of change and 
of infinitesimals. You might say it’s the mathematics of 
infinitesimal changes — changes that occur every gazillionth 
of a second.
Without differential calculus — if you’ve got only algebra, 
geometry, and trigonometry — you’re limited to the math-
ematics of things that either don’t change or that change 
or move at an unchanging rate. Remember those problems 
from algebra? One train leaves the station at 3 p.m. going 
west at 80 mph. Two hours later another train leaves going 
east at 50 mph. . . . You can handle such a problem with alge-
bra because the speeds or rates are unchanging. Our world, 
however, isn’t one of unchanging rates — rates are in con-
stant flux.
Think about putting men on the moon. Apollo 11 took off from 
a moving launch pad (the earth is both rotating on its axis 
and revolving around the sun). As the Apollo flew higher and 
higher, the friction caused by the atmosphere and the effect 
of the earth’s gravity were changing not just every second, not 
just every millionth of a second, but every infinitesimal fraction 
of a second. The spacecraft’s weight was also constantly chang-
ing as it burned fuel. All of these things influenced the rocket’s 
changing speed. On top of all that, the rocket had to hit a 
moving target, the moon. All of these things were changing, and 
their rates of change were changing. Say the rocket was going 
1000 mph one second and 1020 mph a second later — during 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
34
that one second, the rocket’s speed literally passed through 
the infinite number of different speeds between 1000 and 1020 
mph. How can you do the math for these ephemeral things that 
change every infinitesimal part of a second? You can’t do it 
without differentiation.
Differential calculus is used for all sorts of terrestrial things 
as well. Modern economic theory, for example, relies on differ-
entiation. In economics, everything is in constant flux. Prices 
go up and down, supply and demand fluctuate, and inflation 
is constantly changing. These things are constantly changing, 
and the ways they affect each other are constantly changing. 
You need calculus for this.
The Derivative: It’s Just Slope
Differentiation is the first of the two major ideas in calculus 
(the other is integration). Differentiation is the process of 
finding the derivative of a function like 
. The derivative 
is just a fancy calculus term for a simple idea you know from 
algebra: slope. Slope, as you know, is the fancy algebra term 
for steepness. 
 
In differential calculus, you study differentiation, which is the 
process of deriving — that’s finding — derivatives. These are 
big words for a simple idea: finding the steepness or slope of 
a line or curve. Throw some of these terms around to impress 
your friends. 
Consider Figure 4-1. A steepness of 1/2 means that as the 
stickman walks one foot to the right, he goes up 1/2 foot; 
where the steepness is 3, he goes up 3 feet as he walks 1 foot 
to the right. Where the steepness is zero, he’s at the top, 
going neither up nor down; and where the steepness is nega-
tive, he’s going down. A steepness of 
, for example, means 
that he goes down 2 feet for every foot he goes to the right.

The slope of a line
By now you should know that slope is what differentiation 
is all about. Consider the line y = 2x + 3. Plug 1 into x and y 
equals 5, which gives you the point located at (1, 5); plug 2 
into x and y equals 7, giving you the point (2, 7); plug 3 into 
x and y equals 9, that’s the point (3, 9), and so on. Now let’s 
calculate the line’s slope (yes, I realize that y = mx + b tells me 
that the slope is 2; just humor me). Recall that
 
The rise is the vertical distance between two points, and the 
run is the horizontal distance between the two points. Now, 
take any two points on the line, say, (1, 5) and (6, 15), and 
figure the rise and the run. You rise up 10 from (1, 5) to (6, 15) 
because 5 plus 10 is 15. And you run across 5 from (1, 5) to 
(6, 15) because 1 plus 5 is 6. Next, divide to get the slope:

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
36
Here’s how you do the same problem using the slope formula:
Plug in the points (1, 5) and (6, 15):
The derivative of a line
The preceding section showed you the algebra of slope. 
Now here’s the calculus. The derivative (the slope) of the line, 
y = 2x + 3 is always 2, so you write
  (Read dee y dee x equals 2.)
Another common way of writing the same thing is
  (Read y prime equals 2.)
And you say,
 The derivative of the function, y = 2x + 3, is 2.
The Derivative: It’s Just a Rate
Here’s another way to understand the idea of a derivative 
that’s even more fundamental than the concept of slope: A 
derivative is a rate. So why did I start the chapter with slope? 
Because slope is in some respects the easier of the two con-
cepts, and slope is the idea you return to again and again in 
this book and any other calculus textbook as you look at the 
graphs of dozens of functions. But before you’ve got a slope, 
you’ve got a rate. A slope is, in a sense, a picture of a rate; the 
rate comes first, the picture of it comes second. Just like you 
can have a function before you see its graph, you can have a 
rate before you see it as a slope.
Calculus on the playground
Imagine Laurel and Hardy on a teeter-totter — see Figure 4-2.

 Chapter 4: Differentiation Orientation 37
20"
10"
Figure 4-2: Laurel and Hardy — blithely unaware of the calculus implications.
Assuming Hardy weighs twice as much as Laurel, Hardy has to 
sit twice as close to the center as Laurel for them to balance. 
And for every inch that Hardy goes down, Laurel goes up two. 
So Laurel moves twice as much as Hardy. Voilà, you’ve got a 
derivative!
 
A derivative is simply a measure of how much one thing 
changes compared to another — and that’s a rate.
Laurel moves twice as much as Hardy, so you write
dL = 2dH
Loosely speaking, dL can be thought of as the change in 
Laurel’s position, and dH as the change in Hardy’s position. 
You can see that if Hardy goes down 10 inches, then dH is 10, 
and because dL equals 2 times dH, dL is 20 — so Laurel goes up 
20 inches. Dividing both sides of this equation by dH gives you
And that’s the derivative of Laurel with respect to Hardy. (It’s 
read as, “dee L, dee H,” or as, “the derivative of L with respect 
to H.”) The fact that 
 simply means Laurel is moving 2 
times as much as Hardy. Laurel’s rate of movement is 2 inches 
per inch of Hardy’s movement.
Now let’s look at it from Hardy’s point of view. Hardy moves 
half as much as Laurel, so you can also write

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
38
Dividing by dL gives you
This is the derivative of Hardy with respect to Laurel, and it 
means Hardy moves  inch for every inch Laurel moves. Thus, 
Hardy’s rate is  inch per inch of Laurel’s movement. By the 
way, you can also get this derivative by taking 
, which is 
the same as 
, and flipping it upside down to get 
.
These rates of 2 inches per inch and  inch per inch may seem 
odd because we often think of rates as referring to something 
per unit of time, like miles per hour. But a rate can be anything 
per anything. So, whenever you’ve got a this per that, you’ve 
got a rate; and if you’ve got a rate, you’ve got a derivative.
 
There’s no end to the different rates you might see: miles per 
gallon (for gas mileage), gallons per minute (for water draining 
out of a pool), output per employee (for a factory’s productiv-
ity), and so on. Rates can be constant or changing. In either 
case, every rate is a derivative, and every derivative is a rate.
The rate-slope connection
Rates and slopes have a simple connection. The previous rate 
examples can be graphed on an x-y coordinate system, where 
each rate appears as a slope. Laurel moving twice as much as 
Hardy can be represented by the following equation:
L = 2H
Figure 4-3 shows the graph of this function.
The inches on the H-axis indicate how far Hardy has moved up 
or down from the teeter-totter’s starting position; the inches 
on the L-axis show how far Laurel has moved up or down. The 
line goes up 2 inches for each inch it goes to the right, and its 

 Chapter 4: Differentiation Orientation 39
slope is thus , or 2. This is the visual depiction of 
, 
and it shows that Laurel’s position changes 2 times as much 
as Hardy’s.

. Well, you can 
think of dL as the rise and dH as the run. That ties everything 
together.
Don’t forget, a derivative is a slope, and a derivative is a rate.
The Derivative of a Curve
The previous sections in this chapter involve linear 
 functions — straight lines with unchanging slopes. But if 
all functions and graphs were lines with unchanging slopes, 
there’d be no need for calculus. The derivative of the Laurel 
and Hardy function graphed previously is 2, but you don’t 
need calculus to determine the slope of a line. Calculus is the 
 mathematics of change, so now is a good time to move on to 
parabolas, curves with changing slopes. Figure 4-4 is the graph 
of the parabola, 
.

Notice how the parabola gets steeper and steeper as you go to 
the right. You can see from the graph that at the point (2, 1), 
the slope is 1; at (4, 4), the slope is 2; at (6, 9), the slope is 3, 
and so on. It turns out that the derivative of this function 
equals 
 (I show you how I got that in a minute). To find the 
slope of the curve at any point, you just plug the x-coordinate 
of the point into the derivative, 
, and you’ve got the slope. 
For instance, if you want the slope at the point (3, 2.25), plug 3 
into the x, and the slope is  times 3, or 1.5. 
Here’s the calculus. You write
And you say,
The derivative of the function 
.
I promised to tell you how to derive this derivative of 
:

 Chapter 4: Differentiation Orientation 41
 
1. Take the power and put it in front of the coefficient.
 
 
 
2. Multiply.
 
 
 
3. Reduce the power by 1.
 
 In this example the 2 becomes a 1. So the derivative is 
 
 
The Difference Quotient
Sound the trumpets! You come now to what is perhaps the 
cornerstone of differential calculus: the difference quotient, 
the bridge between limits and the derivative. (But you’re 
going to have to be patient here, because it’s going to take 
me a few pages to explain the logic behind the difference quo-
tient before I can show you what it is.) Okay, so here goes. 
You know that a derivative is just a slope. You know all about 
the slope of a line, and in Figure 4-4, I gave you the slope of 
the parabola at several points and showed you the short-cut 
for finding the derivative — but I left out the important math 
in the middle. That math involves limits and the difference 
quotient, and takes us to the threshold of calculus. Hold on to 
your hat.
To compute a slope, you need two points to plug into the 
slope formula. For a line, this is easy. You just pick any two 
points on the line and plug them in. But say you want the 
slope of the parabola in Figure 4-5 at the point (2, 4). 
You can see the line drawn tangent to the curve at (2, 4), and 
because the slope of the tangent line is the same as the slope 
of the parabola at (2, 4), all you need is the slope of the tan-
gent line. But you don’t know the equation of the tangent line, 
so you can’t get the second point — in addition to (2, 4) — 
that you need for the slope formula. Here’s how the inventors 
of calculus got around this roadblock. Figure 4-5 also shows a 
secant line (a line intersecting a curve at two points) intersect-
ing the parabola at (2, 4) and at (10, 100).

Figure 4-5: The graph of 
 with a tangent line and a secant line.
The slope of this secant line is given by the slope formula:
This secant line is quite a bit steeper than the tangent line, 
so the slope of the secant, 12, is higher than the slope you’re 
looking for.
Now add one more point at (6, 36) and draw another secant 
using that point and (2, 4) again. See Figure 4-6.
Calculate the slope of this second secant:
You can see that this secant line is a better approximation 
of the tangent line than the first secant. Now, imagine what 
would happen if you grabbed the point at (6, 36) and slid it 
down the parabola toward (2, 4), dragging the secant line 
along with it. Can you see that as the point gets closer and 
closer to (2, 4), the secant line gets closer and closer to the 
tangent line, and that the slope of this secant thus gets closer 
and closer to the slope of the tangent?

Figure 4-6: The graph of

So, you can get the slope of the tangent if you take the limit of 
the slope of this moving secant. Let’s give the moving point 
the coordinates 
. As this point 
 slides closer and 
closer to 
, namely (2, 4), the run — that’s 
 — 
gets closer and closer to zero. So here’s the limit you need:
Watch what happens to this limit when you plug in three more 
points on the parabola that are closer and closer to (2, 4):
When the point 
 slides to (2.1, 4.41), the slope is 4.1.
When the point slides to (2.01, 4.0401), the slope is 4.01.
When the point slides to (2.001, 4.004001), the slope is 
4.001.
Sure looks like the slope is headed toward 4.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
44
As with all limit problems, the variable in this problem, the 
run, approaches but never actually gets to zero. If it got to 
zero — which would happen if you slid the point you grabbed 
along the parabola until it was actually on top of (2, 4) — 
you’d have a slope of , which is undefined. But, of course, 
that’s precisely the slope you want — the slope of the line 
when the point does land on top of (2, 4). Herein lies the 
beauty of the limit process. With this limit, you get the exact 
slope of the tangent line even though the limit function, 
, 
generates slopes of secant lines.
Here again is the equation for the slope of the tangent line:
And the slope of the tangent line is — yes — the derivative.
 
The derivative of a function 
 at some number x = c, written 
, is the slope of the tangent line to f drawn at c.
The slope fraction 
 is expressed with algebra terminology. 
Now let’s rewrite it to give it that highfalutin calculus look. But 
first, finally, the definition you’ve been waiting for:
 
Definition of the Difference Quotient: There’s a calculus 
 
term for the general slope fraction, 
 or 
, when you 
 
write it in the fancy calculus way. A fraction is a quotient, 
right? And both 
 and 
 are differences, right? So, 
voilà, it’s called the difference quotient. Here it is:
In the next two pages I show you how 
 morphs into the 
difference quotient.
 
Okay, let’s lay out this morphing process. First, the run, 
 
(in this example, 
), is called — don’t ask me why — h. 
Next, because 
 and the run equals h, 
 equals 2 + h. You 
then write 
 as 
 and 
 as 
. Making all the substitu-
tions gives you the derivative of 
 at x = 2:

 is simply the shrinking 
 stair step you 
 
can see in Figure 4-6 as the point slides down the parabola 
toward (2, 4).
Figure 4-7 is like Figure 4-6 except that instead of exact points 
like (6, 36) and (10, 100), the sliding point has the general 
coordinates of

expressed in terms of h.

 showing how a limit produces the slope of the 
tangent line at (2, 4).

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
46
Doing the math gives you the slope of the tangent line at (2, 4):
So the slope is 4. (By the way, it’s just a coincidence that the 
slope at (2, 4) happens to be the same as the y-coordinate of 
the point.)
 
Definition of the Derivative: If you replace the point 
 in
 
the above limit equation with the general point 
, you
 
get the general definition of the derivative as a function of x:
So at last you see that the derivative is defined as the limit of 
the difference quotient.
Now work out this limit and get the derivative for the parabola 
.

 Chapter 4: Differentiation Orientation 47
Thus for this parabola, the derivative — that’s the slope of the 
tangent line — equals 2x. Plug any number into x, and you get 
the slope of the parabola at that x-value! Try it.
Average and Instantaneous Rate
Returning once again to the connection between slopes and 
rates, a slope is just the visual depiction of a rate: The slope, 
, just tells you the rate at which y changes compared to x. 
If, for example, y is the number of miles and x is the number of 
hours, you get the familiar rate of miles per hour.
Each secant line in Figure 4-6 has a slope given by the formula 
. That slope is the average rate over the interval from 
. If y is in miles and x is in hours, you get the average 
speed in miles per hour during the time interval from 
.
When you take the limit and get the slope of the tangent line, 
you get the instantaneous rate at the point 
. Again, if y is 
in miles and x is in hours, you get the instantaneous speed at 
the point in time, 
. Because the slope of the tangent line is the 
derivative, this gives us another definition of the derivative.
 
The derivative of a function 
 at some x-value is the instan-
taneous rate of change of f with respect to x at that value.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies

Three Cases Where the 
Derivative Does Not Exist
By now you certainly know that the derivative of a function at 
a given point is the slope of the tangent line at that point. So, 
if you can’t draw a tangent line, there’s no derivative — that 
happens in two cases. In the third case, there’s a tangent line, 
but its slope and the derivative are undefined:
 
1. There’s no tangent line and thus no derivative at any 
type of discontinuity: infinite, removable, or jump. 
Continuity is, therefore, a necessary condition for dif-
ferentiability. It’s not, however, a sufficient condition 
as the next two cases show. Dig that logician-speak.
 
2. There’s no tangent line and thus no derivative at 
a sharp corner on a function (or at a cusp, a really 
pointy, sharp turn). See function f in Figure 4-8.
 
3. Where a function has a vertical inflection point (see 
function g), the slope is undefined and thus the deriva-
tive fails to exist.

n this chapter I give you shortcut techniques for finding 
derivatives that avoid the difficulties of limits and the 
difference quotient. Then, after you absorb this somewhat 
tedious material, Chapters 6 and 7 show you how to use the 
derivative to solve all sorts of interesting problems.
Basic Differentiation Rules
Calculus can be difficult, but you’d never know it judging by 
this section. Learning these few basic rules is a snap. 
The constant rule
This is simple. 
 is a horizontal line with a slope of zero, 
and thus its derivative is also zero. So, for any number c, if 
, then 
. Or you can write 
. End of story.
The power rule
Say 
. To find its derivative, take the power, 5, bring it in 
front of the x, and reduce the power by 1 (in this example, the 
power becomes a 4). That gives you 
. Piece o' cake.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
50
In Chapter 4, I differentiate 
 with the difference quotient. 
It takes eight lines of math to do it. Instead of all that, just 
use the power rule: Bring the 2 in front, reduce the power 
by 1, which leaves you with a power of 1 that you can drop 
(because a power of 1 does nothing). Thus,
Once you know the nifty shortcuts like this one, you’ll rarely 
use the difference quotient. So why bother learning all that 
difficult difference quotient stuff? Well, the difference quo-
tient is included in every calculus book and course because it 
gives you a fuller, richer understanding of the calculus and its 
foundations — think of it as a mathematical character builder. 
Or because math teachers are sadists. You be the judge.
The power rule works for positive, negative, and fraction 
powers. 
 
Make sure you remember how to do the last function. It’s the 
simplest function, yet the easiest problem to miss. You can 
just memorize that the derivative of x is 1. Or do it like this: 
Rewrite 
 as 
 and then apply the power rule: 
Bring the 1 in front and reduce the power by 1 to zero, giving 
you 
. Because 
 equals 1, you’ve got 
.
 
You can differentiate radical functions by rewriting them as 
power functions and then using the power rule. For example, 
if 
, rewrite it as 
 and use the power rule. 
You can also use the power rule to differentiate functions like 
 
. Rewrite this as 
 and use the power rule.
The constant multiple rule
What if the function you’re differentiating begins with a coef-
ficient? Makes no difference. A coefficient has no effect on 
differentiation. Just ignore it and differentiate according to 

 Chapter 5: Differentiation Rules 51
the appropriate rule. The coefficient stays where it is until the 
final step when you simplify your answer by multiplying by 
the coefficient.
Differentiate 
.
Solution: You know by the power rule that the derivative of 
 is 
, so the derivative of 
 is 
. The 4 just sits 
there doing nothing. Then, as a final step, you simplify: 
 
equals 
. So 
.
Differentiate y = 5x.
Solution: This is a line of the form y = mx + b with m = 5, so the 
slope is 5 and thus the derivative is 5: 
. (It’s important to 
think graphically like this sometimes.) But you can also solve 
it with the power rule. 
; so 
.
In a nutshell, the constant multiple rule takes a function like 
, differentiates the stuff — that’s 
 — while the 
10 just stays put. So, if 
, then 
.
 
Don’t forget that  (~3.14) and e (~2.72) are numbers, not 
variables, so they behave like ordinary numbers. Constants in 
problems, like c and k, also behave like ordinary numbers. 
Thus, if 
 — this works exactly like differentiating 
y = 5x. And because 
 is just a number, if 
 then 
 — 
this works exactly like differentiating y = 10. You’ll also see 
problems containing constants like c and k. Be sure to treat 
them like regular numbers. For example, the derivative of 
 (where k is a constant) is 5, not 
.
The sum and difference rules
When you want the derivative of a sum of terms, take the 
derivative of each term separately.
What’s 
Just use the power rule for each of the first four terms and the 
constant rule for the final term. Thus, 
.

If you’ve got a difference (that’s subtraction) instead of 
a sum, it makes no difference. You still differentiate each 
term separately. Thus, if 
, then 
. 
Differentiating trig functions
I have the high honor and distinct privilege of introducing you 
to the derivatives of the six trig functions.
Make sure you memorize the derivatives for sine and cosine — 
they’re a snap. You should learn the other four as well, but if 
you’re afraid that this knowledge will crowd out the date of 
the Battle of Hastings (1066), you can use the following nifty 
mnemonic device I made up.
 
Imagine you’re taking a test and can’t remember these four 
derivatives. You lean over to the guy next to you and whisper, 
“Psst, hey what’s the derivative of cscx?” Now, take the last 
three letters of psst (sst) — those are the initial letters of sec, 
sec, tan. Write these three down, and below them write their 
cofunctions: csc, csc, cot. Put a negative sign on the csc in the 
middle. Finally, add arrows like in the following diagram.
The sec on the left has an arrow pointing to sec tan — so the 
derivative of secx is secx tanx. The tan on the right has an 
arrow pointing to sec sec, so the derivative of tanx is 
. 
The bottom row works the same except both derivatives are 
negative. Believe it or not, this trick is easy to remember.

 Chapter 5: Differentiation Rules 53
Exponential and logarithmic 
 functions
If you can’t memorize the next rule, hang up your calculator.
That’s right, the derivative of 
 is itself! This is a special func-
tion. 
 and its multiples, like 
, are the only functions that 
are their own derivatives. 
If the base is a number other than e, you have to tweak the 
derivative by multiplying it by the natural log of the base:
 
If 
, then 
.
 
If 
, then 
.
Here’s the derivative of the natural log:
If the log base is a number other than e, you tweak this 
 derivative — as with exponential functions — except you 
divide by the natural log of the base instead of multiplying:
Derivative Rules for Experts
These rules, especially the chain rule, can be a bit tough.
The product and quotient rules
 
The Product Rule (for the product (duh) of two functions):

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
54
So, for 
 
The Quotient Rule (bet you can guess what this is for):
 
Most calculus books give this rule in a slightly different form 
that’s harder to remember. And some give a “mnemonic” 
involving the words lodeehi and hideelo or hodeehi and 
hideeho, which is easy to get mixed up — great, thanks a lot.
Memorize the quotient rule as I’ve written it. You’ll remem-
ber what goes in the denominator — no one ever forgets it. 
The trick is knowing the order of the terms in the numerator. 
Think of it like this: You’re doing a derivative, so the first 
thing you do is to take a derivative. The natural place to begin 
is at the top of the fraction. So the quotient rule begins with 
the derivative of the top. Remember that, and the rest of the 
numerator is almost automatic. 
Here’s the derivative of 
:
The chain rule
The chain rule is by far the trickiest derivative rule, but it’s 
not really that bad if you carefully focus on a few important 

 Chapter 5: Differentiation Rules 55
points. Let’s begin by differentiating 
. You use 
the chain rule here because you’ve got a composite function, 
that’s one function 
 inside another function (the 
square root function).
 
Here’s one way to quickly recognize a composite function.  
 is not a composite function because the argument of 
the square root — the thing you take the square root of — is 
simply x. Whenever the argument of a function is anything 
other than a plain old x, you’ve got a composite function. Be 
careful to distinguish a composite function from something 
like 
, which is the product of two functions, 
 
and sin x, each of which does have just an x as its argument.
Okay, so you’ve got this composite function, 
. 
Here’s how to differentiate it with the chain rule.
 
1. You start with the outside function, 
, and differ-
entiate that, IGNORING what’s inside. To make sure 
you ignore the inside, temporarily replace the inside 
function with the word stuff.
 
 So you’ve got 
. Okay, now differentiate 
 the same way you’d differentiate 
. 
Because 
 is the same as 
, the power rule 
 
 gives you 
. So for this problem, you begin 
 
 with 
.
 
2. Multiply the result from Step 1 by the derivative of 
the inside function, 
.
 
 
 
 Take a good look at this. All basic chain rule problems 
follow this format. You do the derivative rule for the 
outside function, ignoring the inside stuff, then multi-
ply that by the derivative of the stuff.
 
3. Differentiate the inside stuff.
 
 The inside stuff in this problem is 
, and its deriv-
ative is 
 by the power rule.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
56
 
4. Now put the real stuff and its derivative back where 
they belong.
 
 
 
 Or, if you’ve got something against negative powers, 
 
 
. Or, if you’ve got something against 
 
 fraction powers, 
.
Let’s differentiate another composite function: 
.
 
1. The outside function is the sine function, so you start 
there, taking the derivative of sine and ignoring the 
inside stuff, 
. The derivative of sin x is cos x, so 
for this problem, you begin with
 
 
 
2. Multiply the derivative of the outside function by the 
derivative of the stuff.
 
 
 
3. The stuff in this problem is 
, so 
 is 2x. When 
you plug these terms back in, you get
 
 
Sometimes figuring out which function is inside which can be 
tricky — especially when a function is inside another and then 
both of them are inside a third (you can have four or more 
nested functions, but three is probably the most you’ll see).
 
Rewrite the composite function with a set of parentheses 
around each inside function, and rewrite trig functions like 
 with the power outside a set of parentheses: 
.
For example — this is tough — differentiate 
. 
First, rewrite the cubed sine function: 
. Now 
it’s easy to see the order in which the functions are nested. 
The innermost function is in the innermost parentheses — 
that’s 
. Next, the sine function is in the next set of 

 Chapter 5: Differentiation Rules 57
parentheses — that’s 
. Last, the cubing function is 
outside everything — that’s 
. (Did you notice that the 
stuff in 
 is different from the stuff in 
? I admit this 
is quite unmathematical, but don’t sweat it. I’m just using the 
term stuff to refer to whatever is inside any function.) Now 
that you know the order of the functions, you differentiate 
from outside in.
 
1. The outermost function is 
 and its derivative is 
given by the power rule.
 
 
 
2. As with all chain rule problems, you multiply that by 
.
 
 
 
3. Now put the stuff, 
, back where it 
belongs.
 
 
 
4. Use the chain rule again.
 
 You can’t finish this quickly by just taking a simple deriv-
ative because you have to differentiate another compos-
ite function, 
. Just treat 
 as if 
it were the original problem and take its derivative. The 
derivative of sin x is cos x, so the derivative of 
 
begins with 
. Multiply that by 
. Thus, the 
derivative of 
 is
 
 
 
5. The stuff for this step is 
 and its derivative 
is 10x – 4. Plug those things back in.
 
 
 
6. Now that you’ve got the derivative of 
, 
plug this result into the result from Step 3, giving you 
the whole enchilada.
 
 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
58
You can save some time by not switching to the word stuff 
and then switching back. But some people like to use the tech-
nique because it forces them to leave the stuff alone during 
each step of a problem. That’s the critical point.
 
Make sure you . . . DON’T TOUCH THE STUFF.
Don’t change the inside function while differentiating the 
outside one. Say you want to differentiate 
. The 
argument of this natural logarithm function is 
. Don’t touch 
it during the first step of the solution, which is to use the 
natural log rule: 
, which says to put the argument 
of the natural log function in the denominator under the 1. 
So, after the first step in differentiating 
, you’ve got 
. 
Finish by multiplying that by the derivative of 
, which is 
. 
Final answer: .
 
Another way to avoid chain rule mistakes is to remember that 
you never use more than one derivative rule at a time.
In the previous example, 
, you first use the natural log 
rule, then, as a separate step, you use the power rule to differ-
entiate 
. At no point in any chain rule problem do you use 
both rules at the same time and write something like 
.
 
The Chain Rule (for differentiating a composite function):
 
If 
,
 
then 
.
Or, equivalently,
 
If 
,
 
then 
 (notice how the dus cancel).
Finally, differentiate 
. This one has a new twist — 
it involves the chain rule and the product rule. How do you 
begin?

 Chapter 5: Differentiation Rules 59
 
If you’re not sure where to begin differentiating a complex 
expression, imagine plugging a number into x and then evalu-
ating the expression on your calculator one step at a time. 
Your last computation tells you the first thing to do.
Say you plug the number 5 into the xs in 
. You 
evaluate 
 — that’s 100; then, after getting 
, you do 
, which is about 
. Finally, you multiply 100 by 
. Because your last computation is multiplication, your 
first step in differentiating is to use the product rule. (Had your 
last computation been something like 
, you’d begin 
with the chain rule.) So for 
, start with the 
product rule:
Now finish by taking the derivative of 
 with the power rule 
and the derivative of 
 with the chain rule:
Differentiating Implicitly
All the differentiation problems so far in this chapter are func-
tions like 
 or y = sin x (and y was sometimes written 
as 
, as in 
). In such cases, y is written explic-
itly as a function of x. This means that the equation is solved 
for y (with y by itself on one side of the equation).
Sometimes, however, you are asked to differentiate an equation 
that’s not solved for y, like 
. This equation 
defines y implicitly as a function of x, and you can’t write it as 
an explicit function because it can’t be solved for y. For this you 
need implicit differentiation. When differentiating implicitly, all 
the derivative rules work the same with one exception: when 
you differentiate a term with a y in it, you use the chain rule 
with a little twist.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
60
Remember using the chain rule to differentiate something 
like 
 with the stuff technique? The derivative of sine 
is cosine, so the derivative of 
 is 
. 
You finish the problem by finding the derivative of the stuff, 
, which is 
, and then making the substitutions to give you 
. With implicit differentiation, a y works just like 
the word stuff. Thus, because
The twist is that unlike the word stuff, which is temporar-
ily taking the place of some known function of x (
 in this 
example), y is some unknown function of x. And because you 
don’t know what y equals, the y and the 
 — unlike the stuff 
and the 
 — have to remain in the final answer. The con-
cept is the same, and you treat y just like the stuff. It’s just that 
because you don’t know what the function is, you can’t make 
the switch back to xs at the end of the problem like you can 
with a regular chain rule problem. Here goes. Differentiate 
.
 
1. Differentiate each term on both sides of the equation.
 
 For the first and fourth terms, use the power rule and 
the chain rule. For the second term, use the regular 
power rule. For the third, use the regular sine rule.
 
 
 
2. Collect all terms containing a 
 on the left side of 
the equation and all other terms on the right.
 
 
 
3. Factor out 
.
 
 
 
4. Divide for the final answer.

f you’ve read Chapters 4 and 5, you’re probably an expert 
at finding derivatives. Which is a good thing, because in 
this chapter you use derivatives to understand the shape of 
functions — where they rise, fall, max out and bottom out, 
how they curve, and so on. 
A Calculus Road Trip
Imagine that you’re driving along the function in Figure 6-1 
from left to right. Along your drive, there are several points 
of interest between a and l. All of them, except for the start 
and finish points, relate to the steepness of the road — in 
other words, its slope or derivative. I’m going to throw lots 
of new terms and definitions at you all at once here, but you 
shouldn’t have too much trouble because these ideas mostly 
involve commonsense notions like driving up or down an 
incline, or going over the crest of a hill.

✓ The function in Figure 6-1 has a derivative of zero at 
stationary points (level points) b, d, g, i, and k. At j, the 
derivative is undefined (a sharp turning point like j is a 
corner). These points where the derivative is either zero 
or undefined are the critical points of the function. The 
x-values of these critical points are the function’s critical 
numbers. 
 
✓ All local maxes and mins — peaks and valleys — must 
occur at critical points. However, not all critical points 
are local maxes or mins. Point k, for instance, is a critical 
point but neither a max nor a min. Local maximums and 
minimums — or maxima and minima — are called, col-
lectively, local extrema of the function. A single local max 
or min is a local extremum. Point g is the absolute maxi-
mum on the interval from a to l because it’s the highest 
point on the road from a to l. Point l is the absolute mini-
mum. Note that g is also a local max, but l is not a local 
min because endpoints (and points of discontinuity) do 
not qualify as local extrema.
 
✓ The function is increasing whenever you’re going up, 
where the derivative is positive; it’s decreasing whenever 
you’re going down, where the derivative is negative. The 

 Chapter 6: Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 63
function is also decreasing at point k, a horizontal inflec-
tion point, even though the slope and derivative are zero 
there. I realize that seems odd, but that’s how it works. 
At all horizontal inflection points, a function is either 
increasing or decreasing. At local extrema b, d, g, i, and j, 
the function is neither increasing nor decreasing.
 
✓ The function is concave up wherever it looks like a cup 
(rhymes with up) or a smile (or where it “holds water”) 
and concave down wherever it looks like a frown (rhymes 
with down; where it “spills water”). Wherever a function 
is concave up, its derivative is increasing; wherever a 
function is concave down, its derivative is decreasing. 
Inflection points c, e, h, and k are where the concavity 
switches from up to down or vice versa. Inflection points 
are also the steepest or least steep points in their imme-
diate neighborhoods.
 
Be careful with function sections that have a negative slope. 
Point c is the steepest point in its neighborhood because it 
has a bigger negative slope than any other nearby point. But 
remember, a big negative number is actually a small number, 
so the slope and derivative at c are actually the smallest of 
all the points in the neighborhood. From b to c the derivative 
of the function is decreasing (because it’s becoming a bigger 
negative). From c to d, it’s increasing (because it’s becoming a 
smaller negative).
Local Extrema
Now that you know what local extrema are, you need to know 
how to do the math to find them. Remember, all local extrema 
occur at critical points of a function — where the derivative 
is zero or undefined. So, the first step in finding a function’s 
local extrema is to find its critical numbers (the x-values of 
the critical points).
Finding the critical numbers

1. Find the first derivative of f using the power rule.
 
 
 
2. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.
 
 
 
 
These three x-values are critical numbers of f. Additional criti-
cal numbers could exist if the first derivative were undefined 
at some x-values, but because the derivative, 
, is 
defined for all input values, the above solution set, 0, –2, and 2 
is the complete list of critical numbers. Because the derivative 
of f equals zero at these three critical numbers, the curve has 
horizontal tangents at these numbers.

 Chapter 6: Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 65
Now that you’ve got the list of critical numbers, you need to 
determine whether peaks or valleys or neither occur at those 
x-values by using either the First Derivative Test or the Second 
Derivative Test. (Of course, you can see where the peaks and val-
leys are by just looking at Figure 6-2, but you still have to learn 
the math.)
The First Derivative Test
The First Derivative Test is based on the Nobel-prize-caliber 
ideas that as you go over the top of a hill, first you go up and 
then you go down, and that when you drive into and out of a 
valley, you go down and then up. This calculus stuff is pretty 
amazing, isn’t it?
Take a number line and put down the critical numbers you 
found above: 0, –2, and 2. See Figure 6-3.

Figure 6-3: The critical numbers of 
.
This number line is now divided into four regions: to the left 
of –2, from –2 to 0, from 0 to 2, and to the right of 2. Pick a 
value from each region, plug it into the derivative, and note 
whether your result is positive or negative. Let’s use the num-
bers –3, –1, 1, and 3 to test the regions.
These four results are, respectively, positive, negative, negative, 
or positive. Now, take your number line, mark each region with 
the appropriate positive or negative sign, and indicate whether 
the function is increasing (derivative is positive) or decreasing 
(derivative is negative). The result is a sign graph. See Figure 6-4.

.
Figure 6-4 simply tells you what you already know from the 
graph of f — that the function goes up until 
, down from 
 
to 0, further down from 0 to 2, and up again from 2 on.
The function switches from increasing to decreasing at 
;
you go up to 
 and then down. So at 
 you have a hill or a 
local maximum. Conversely, because the function switches 
from decreasing to increasing at 2, you have a valley there or 
a local minimum. And because the signs of the first derivative 
don’t switch at zero, there’s neither a min nor a max at that 
x-value (you get an inflection point when this happens).
The last step is to obtain the function values (heights) of 
these two local extrema by plugging the x-values into the 
original function:
The local max is at 
 and the local min is at 
. 
The Second Derivative Test
The Second Derivative Test is based on two more prize-winning 
ideas: That at the crest of a hill, a road has a hump shape, so 
it’s curving down or concave down; and that at the bottom of a 
valley, a road is cup-shaped, so it’s curving up or concave up.
The concavity of a function at a point is given by its second 
derivative: A positive second derivative means the function is 
concave up, a negative second derivative means the function 
is concave down, and a second derivative of zero is inconclu-
sive (the function could be concave up, concave down, or 

 Chapter 6: Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 67
there could be an inflection point there). So, for our function 
f, all you have to do is find its second derivative and then 
plug in the critical numbers you found (
, 0, and 2) and note 
whether your results are positive, negative, or zero. To wit —
At 
, the second derivative is negative (
). This tells you 
that f is concave down where x equals 
, and therefore that 
there’s a local max at 
. The second derivative is positive 
(240) where x is 2, so f is concave up and thus there’s a local 
min at x = 2. Because the second derivative equals zero at x = 0, 
the Second Derivative Test fails — it tells you nothing about the 
concavity at x = 0 or whether there’s a local min or max there. 
When this happens, you have to use the First Derivative Test.
Now go through both derivative tests one more time 
with another example. Find the local extrema of

 Because the first derivative of g switches from posi-
tive to negative at 0, there’s a local max there. And 
because the first derivative switches from negative to 
positive at 1, there’s a local min at x = 1.
 
5. Plug the critical numbers into g to obtain the func-
tion values (the heights) of these two local extrema.
 
 
So, there’s a local max at (0, 4) and a local min at (1, 3).
You could have used the Second Derivative Test instead of 
the First in Step 4. You’d need the second derivative of g, 
which is, as you know, the derivative of its first derivative:
Evaluate the second derivative at 1 (the critical number 
where 
).
Because 
 is positive, you know that g is concave up at 
x = 1 and, therefore, that there’s a local min there. The Second 
Derivative Test is no help where the first derivative is unde-
fined (where x = 0), so you’ve got to use the First Derivative 
Test for that critical number.
Finding Absolute Extrema 
on a Closed Interval
Every function that’s continuous on a closed interval has an 
absolute maximum and an absolute minimum value in that 
interval — a highest and lowest point — though, as you see in 
the following example, there can be a tie for highest or lowest 
value.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
70
 
A closed interval like [2, 5] includes the endpoints 2 and 5. An 
open interval like (2, 5) excludes the endpoints.
Finding the absolute max and min is a snap. All you do is com-
pute the critical numbers of the function in the given interval, 
determine the height of the function at each critical number, 
and then figure the height of the function at the two endpoints 
of the interval. The greatest of this set of heights is the abso-
lute max; and the least is the absolute min. Example: Find the 
absolute max and min of 
 in the closed 
interval 
.
 
1. Find the critical numbers of h in the open interval 
 
 
.
 
 
  
 
 Thus, the zeros of 
, and 
 
 because  is defined for all input numbers, this is the 
complete list of critical numbers.
 
2. Compute the function values (the heights) at each 
critical number.
 
  

 Chapter 6: Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 71
 
3. Determine the function values at the endpoints of 
the interval.
 
 
 
 So, from Steps 2 and 3, you’ve found five heights: 1.5, 
1, 1.5, 
, and 1. The largest number in this list, 1.5, is 
the absolute max; the smallest, 
, is the absolute min.
The absolute max occurs at two points: 
 and

A function’s absolute max and absolute min over its entire 
domain are the highest and lowest values of the function any-
where it’s defined. A function can have an absolute max or 
min or both or neither. For example, the parabola 
 has 
an absolute min at the point (0, 0) — the bottom of its cup 
shape — but no absolute max because it goes up forever to 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies

the left and the right. You could say that its absolute max is 
infinity if it weren’t for the fact that infinity is not a number 
and thus it doesn’t qualify as a maximum (ditto, of course, for 
negative infinity as a minimum).
The basic idea is this: Either a function will max out some-
where or it will go up forever to infinity. And the same idea 
applies to a min and going down to negative infinity.
To locate a function’s absolute max and min over its domain, 
find the height of the function at each of its critical numbers — 
just like in the previous section, except that here you consider 
all the critical numbers, not just those in a given interval. The 
highest of these values is the absolute max unless the function 
rises to positive infinity somewhere, in which case you say that it 
has no absolute max. The lowest of these values is the absolute 
min, unless the function goes down to negative infinity, in which 
case it has no absolute min.
If a function goes up or down infinitely, it does so at its 
extreme right or left or at a vertical asymptote. So, your last 
step (after evaluating all the critical points) is to evaluate 
 and 
 — the so-called end behavior of the 
function — and the limit of the function as x approaches each 
vertical asymptote from the left and from the right. If any of 
these limits equals positive infinity, then the function has no 
absolute max; if none equals positive infinity, then the abso-
lute max is the function value at the highest of the critical 
points. And if any of these limits is negative infinity, then the 
function has no absolute min; if none of them equals nega-
tive infinity, then the absolute min is the function value at the 
lowest of the critical points.
Figure 6-8 shows a couple functions where the above method 
won’t work. The function 
 has no absolute max despite 
the fact that it doesn’t go up to infinity. Its max isn’t 4 because 
it never gets to 4, and its max can’t be anything less than 4, 
like 3.999, because it gets higher than that, say 3.9999. The 
function 
 has no absolute min despite the fact that it 
doesn’t go down to negative infinity. Going left, 
 crawls 
along the horizontal asymptote at y = 0. g gets lower and 
lower, but it never gets as low as zero, so neither zero nor 
any other number can be the absolute min.

Concavity and Inflection Points
Look back at the function 
 in Figure 6-2. You 
used the three critical numbers of f, 
 0, and 2, to find the 
function’s local extrema: 
 and 
. This section 
investigates what happens elsewhere on this function — spe-
cifically, where the function is concave up or down and where 
the concavity switches (the inflection points).
The process for finding concavity and inflection points is anal-
ogous to using the First Derivative Test and the sign graph 
to find local extrema, except that now you use the second 
derivative. 
 
1. Find the second derivative of f.
 
 
 
2. Set the second derivative equal to zero and solve.

3. Determine whether the second derivative is unde-
fined for any x-values.
 
 
 is defined for all real numbers, so 
there are no other x-values to add to the list from Step 2.
 
 Steps 2 and 3 give you what you could call second 
derivative critical numbers of f because they are 
analogous to the critical numbers of f that you find 
using the first derivative. But, as far as I’m aware, this 
set of numbers has no special name. In any event, the 
important thing to know is that this list is made up of 
the zeros of 
 plus any x-values where 
 is undefined.
 
4. Plot these numbers on a number line and test the 
regions with the second derivative.
 
 Use 
 1, and 2 as test numbers (Figure 6-9 shows 
the sign graph).

 A positive sign on this sign graph tells you that the 
function is concave up in that interval; negative means 
concave down. The function has an inflection point 
(usually) at any x-value where the signs switch from 
positive to negative or vice versa.
 
 Because the signs switch at 
 and 
because these three numbers are zeros of 
, inflec-
tion points occur at these x-values. But in a problem 
where the signs switch at a number where 
 is unde-
fined, you have to check one more thing before you 

 Chapter 6: Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 75
can conclude that there’s an inflection point there. 
An inflection point exists at a given x-value only if 
there’s a tangent line to the function at that number. 
This is the case wherever the first derivative exists or 
where there’s a vertical tangent.
 
5. Plug these three x-values into f to obtain the function 
values of the three inflection points.
 
 
 
 The square root of two equals about 1.4, so there are 
inflection points at about 
, and about 
.
Graphs of Derivatives
You can learn a lot about functions and their derivatives 
by comparing the important features of their graphs. Let’s 
keep going with the same function 
; travel 
along f from left to right (see Figure 6-10), pausing to observe 
its points of interest and what’s happening to the graph 
of 
 at the same points. But first a (long) 
 warning: 
 
Looking at the graph of  in Figure 6-10, or the graph of any 
derivative, you may need to remind yourself frequently that 
“This is the derivative I’m looking at, not the function!” You’ve 
looked at so many graphs of functions over the years that 
when you start looking at graphs of derivatives, you can easily 
lapse into thinking of them as regular functions. You might, 
for instance, look at an interval that’s going up on the graph of 
a derivative and mistakenly conclude that the original function 
must also be going up in the same interval — an easy mistake 
to make. You know that the first derivative is the same thing as 
slope. So, when you see the graph of the first derivative going 
up, you may think, “Oh, the first derivative (the slope) is going 
up, and when the slope goes up that’s like going up a hill, so 
the original function must be rising.” This sounds reasonable 
because, loosely speaking, you can describe the front side of a 
hill as a slope that’s going up, increasing. But mathematically 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
76
speaking, the front side of a hill has a positive slope, not neces-
sarily an increasing slope. So, where a function is increasing, 
the graph of its derivative will be positive, but the derivative 
might be going up or down. Say you’re going up a hill. As you 
approach the top, you’re still going up, but the slope (the 
steepness) is going down. It might be 3, then 2, then 1, and 
then at the top the slope is zero. In such an interval, the graph 
of the function is increasing, but the graph of its derivative is 
decreasing. Got that?

 Chapter 6: Differentiation and the Shape of Curves 77
Okay, let’s get back to f and its derivative, shown in Figure 6-10. 
Remember, before the warning we were traveling along f from 
left to right. Beginning on the left, f increases until the local max 
at 
. It’s going up, so its slope is positive, but f is getting 
less steep so its slope is decreasing — the slope decreases until 
it becomes zero at the peak. This corresponds to the graph of  
(the slope) which is positive (because it’s above the x-axis) but 
decreasing as it goes down to the point 
.
 
Ready for some rules about how the graph of a function com-
pares to the graph of its derivative? Well, ready or not, here 
you go:
 
✓ An increasing interval on a function corresponds to an 
interval on the graph of its derivative that’s positive (or 
zero for one point if the function has a horizontal inflec-
tion point). In other words, a function’s increasing inter-
val corresponds to a part of the derivative graph that’s 
above the x-axis (or that touches the axis for a single 
point in the case of a horizontal inflection point). See 
intervals A and F in Figure 6-10.
 
✓ A local max on the graph of a function corresponds to 
a zero (or x-intercept) on an interval of the graph of its 
derivative that crosses the x-axis going down.
 
 When you look at points on a derivative graph, don’t 
forget that the y-coordinate of a point — like 
 — 
on a graph of a first derivative tells you the slope of the 
original function, not its height. Think of the y-axis on a 
first derivative graph as the slope-axis or the m-axis.
 
✓ A decreasing interval on a function corresponds to a nega-
tive interval on the graph of the derivative (or zero for one 
point if the function has a horizontal inflection point). The 
negative interval on the derivative graph is below the x-axis 
(or in the case of a horizontal inflection point, the derivative 
graph touches the x-axis at a single point). See intervals B, 
C, D, and E in Figure 6-10, where f goes down all the way to 
the local min at 
 and where  is negative — except 
for the point (0, 0) — until it gets to (2, 0).
 
✓ A local min on the graph of a function corresponds to 
a zero (or x-intercept) on an interval of the graph of its 
derivative that crosses the x-axis going up.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
78
Now retrace your steps and look at the concavity and inflection 
points of f in Figure 6-10. First, consider intervals A and B in 
the figure. Starting from the left again, the graph of f is concave 
down — a decreasing slope — until it gets to the inflection point 
at about 
. So, the graph of  decreases until it bot-
toms out at about 
. These coordinates tell you that 
the inflection point at 
 on f has a slope of 
. Note that 
the inflection point at 
 is the steepest point on that 
stretch of the function, but it has the smallest slope because its 
slope is a larger negative than the slope at any nearby point.
Between 
 and the next inflection point at (0, 0), f 
is concave up, which means the same thing as an increasing 
slope. So the graph of  increases from about 
 to where it 
hits a local max at (0, 0). See interval C in Figure 6-10.
 
Time for a couple more rules:
 
✓ A concave down interval on the graph of a function corre-
sponds to a decreasing interval on the graph of its deriva-
tive — intervals A, B, and D in Figure 6-10. And a concave 
up interval on the function corresponds to an increasing 
interval on the derivative — intervals C, E, and F.
 
✓ An inflection point on a function (except for a vertical 
inflection point where the derivative is undefined) cor-
responds to a local extremum on the graph of its deriva-
tive. An inflection point of minimum slope corresponds 
to a local min on the derivative graph; an inflection point 
of maximum slope corresponds to a local max on the 
derivative graph.
After (0, 0), f is concave down till the inflection point at about 
 — this corresponds to the decreasing section of  
from (0, 0) to its min at 
 — interval D in Figure 6-10. 
Finally, f is concave up the rest of the way, which corresponds 
to the increasing section of  beginning at 
 — intervals E 
and F in Figure 6-10.
The Mean Value Theorem
You don’t need the Mean Value Theorem for much, but it’s 
a famous and important theorem, so you really should learn

mumbo jumbo beneath it.

Okay, so here’s what the theorem means. The secant line con-
necting points 
 and 
 in Figure 6-11 has a slope 
given by the slope formula:
Note that this is the same as the right side of the equation in 
the mean value theorem. The derivative at a point is the same 
thing as the slope of the tangent line at that point, so the theo-
rem just says that there must be at least one point between a 
and b where the slope of the tangent is the same as the slope 
of the secant line from a to b. The result is parallel lines like 
you see in Figure 6-11.

n this chapter I finally get around to showing you how to use 
calculus to solve some practical problems. 
Optimization Problems
One practical use of differentiation is finding the maximum or 
minimum value of a real-world function: the maximum output 
of a factory or range of a missile, the minimum time to accom-
plish some task, and so on. Here’s an example.
The maximum area of a corral
A rancher can afford 300 feet of fencing to build a corral that’s 
divided into two equal rectangles. See Figure 7-1. What dimen-
sions will maximize the corral’s area?

1.a. Express the thing you want maximized, the area, as a 
function of the two unknowns, x and y.
 
 
 
 In some optimization problems, you can write the 
thing you’re trying to maximize or minimize as a func-
tion of one variable — which is always what you want. 
But here, the area is a function of two variables, so 
Step 1 has two additional substeps.
 
1.b. Use the given information to relate the two 
unknowns to each other.
 
 The fencing is used for seven sections, thus
 
 
 
1.c. Solve this equation for y and plug the result into the 
y in the equation from Step 1.a. This gives you what 
you need — a function of one variable.
 
 
 
2. Determine the domain of the function.
 
 You can’t have a negative length of fence, so x can’t 
be negative, and the most x can be is 300 divided by 
4, or 75. Thus, 
. You now want to find the 
maximum value of 
 in this interval. You use the 
method from Chapter 6’s “Finding Absolute Extrema 
on a Closed Interval.”
 
3. Find the critical numbers of 
 in the open inter-
val (0, 75) by setting its derivative equal to zero

and solving. And don’t forget to check for numbers 
where the derivative is undefined.
 
 
 
 Because 
 is defined for all x-values, 37.5 is the only 
critical number.
 
4. Evaluate the function at the critical number, 37.5, 
and at the endpoints of the interval, 0 and 75.
 
 
 
The min or max you want isn’t often at an endpoint, but it can 
be, so be sure to evaluate the function at the interval’s two 
endpoints.
The maximum value in the interval is 3,750, and thus, an 
x-value of 37.5 feet maximizes the corral’s area. The length is 
2x, or 75 feet. The width is y, which equals 
. Plugging 
in 37.5 gives you 
, or 50 feet. So the rancher will 
build a 75'×50' corral with an area of 3,750 square feet.
Position, Velocity, 
and Acceleration
Every time you get in your car, you witness differentiation 
first hand. Your speed is the first derivative of your position. 
And when you accelerate or decelerate, you experience a 
second derivative.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
84
 
If a function gives the position of something as a function of 
time, the first derivative gives its velocity, and the second 
derivative gives its acceleration. So, you differentiate position to 
get velocity, and you differentiate velocity to get acceleration.
Here’s an example: A yo-yo moves straight up and down. Its 
height above the ground, as a function of time, is given by the 
function 
, where t is in seconds and 
 
is in inches. At t = 0, it’s 30 inches above the ground, and after 
4 seconds, it’s at a height of 18 inches. Velocity, 
, is the 
derivative of position (height in this problem), and accelera-
tion, 
, is the derivative of velocity. Thus —
Take a look at the graphs of these three functions in Figure 7-2.
Using the three functions and their graphs, I want to discuss 
several things about the yo-yo’s motion:
 
✓ Maximum and minimum height
 
✓ Maximum, minimum, and average velocity
 
✓ Total displacement
 
✓ Maximum, minimum, and average speed
 
✓ Total distance traveled
 
✓ Positive and negative acceleration
 
✓ Speeding up and slowing down
That’s a lot to cover, so I’m going to cut some corners — like 
not always checking endpoints when looking for extrema if 
it’s obvious they don’t occur there. But before discussing the 
bullet points, let’s go over a few things about velocity, speed, 
and acceleration.
Velocity versus speed
Your friends won’t complain — or even notice — if you use 
the words “velocity” and “speed” interchangeably, but your 
friendly mathematician will complain. Here’s the difference.

acceleration functions from 0 to 4 seconds.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
86
For the velocity function in Figure 7-2, upward motion is 
defined as a positive velocity, and downward motion is a nega-
tive velocity — this is the standard way velocity is treated in 
most calculus and physics problems. (If the motion is horizon-
tal, going right is a positive velocity and going left is a nega-
tive velocity.) 
Speed, on the other hand, is always positive (or zero). If a car 
goes by at 50 mph, for instance, you say its speed is 50, and 
you mean positive 50, regardless of whether it’s going to the 
right or the left. For velocity, the direction matters; for speed 
it doesn’t. In everyday life, speed is a simpler idea than veloc-
ity because it agrees with common sense. But in calculus, 
speed is actually the trickier idea because it doesn’t fit nicely 
into the three-function scheme shown in Figure 7-2.
 
You’ve got to keep the velocity-speed distinction in mind 
when analyzing velocity and acceleration. For example, if 
an object is going down (or to the left) faster and faster, its 
speed is increasing, but its velocity is decreasing because its 
velocity is becoming a bigger negative (and bigger negatives 
are smaller numbers). This seems weird, but that’s the way 
it works. And here’s another strange thing: Acceleration is 
defined as the rate of change of velocity, not speed. So, if an 
object is slowing down while going in the downward direction, 
and thus has an increasing velocity — because the velocity is 
becoming a smaller negative — the object has a positive accel-
eration. In everyday English, you’d say the object is deceler-
ating (slowing down), but in calculus class, you say that the 
object has a negative velocity and a positive acceleration. (By 
the way, “deceleration” isn’t exactly a technical term, so you 
should probably avoid it in calculus class. It’s best to use the 
following vocabulary: “positive acceleration,” “negative accel-
eration,” “speeding up,” and “slowing down.” More on these 
things later.)
Maximum and minimum height
The maximum and minimum of 
 occur at the local 
extrema seen in Figure 7-2. To locate them, set the derivative 
of 
, that’s 
, equal to zero and solve.

 Chapter 7: Differentiation Problems 87
 
These two numbers are the zeros of 
 and the t-coordinates 
(time-coordinates) of the max and min of 
, which you can 
see in Figure 7-2. In other words, these are the times when the 
yo-yo reaches its maximum and minimum heights. Plug these 
numbers into 
 to obtain the heights:
So the yo-yo gets as high as about 31.1 inches above the 
ground at 
 second and as low as about 16.9 inches at 
 seconds.
Velocity and displacement
Again, speed is always positive, but going down (or left) is a 
negative velocity. The connection between displacement and dis-
tance traveled is similar: Distance traveled is always positive (or 
zero), but going down (or left) is a negative displacement. The 
basic idea is this: If you drive to a store 1 mile away — taking the 
scenic route and clocking 3 miles on your odometer — your total 
distance traveled is 3 miles, but your displacement is just 1 mile.
Total displacement
Total displacement equals final position minus initial position. 
So, because the yo-yo starts at a height of 30 and ends at a 
height of 18,
This is negative because the net movement is downward.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
88
Average velocity
Average velocity is given by total displacement divided by 
elapsed time. Thus,
This negative answer tells you that the yo-yo, on average, is 
going down 3 inches per second.
Maximum and minimum velocity
To determine the yo-yo’s maximum and minimum velocity 
during the interval from 0 to 4 seconds, set the derivative of 
, that’s 
, equal to zero and solve:
Now, evaluate 
 at the critical number, 2, and at the inter-
val’s endpoints, 0 and 4:
The yo-yo has a maximum velocity of 5 inches per second 
twice — at the beginning and the end of the interval. It reaches 
a minimum velocity of 
 inches per second at t = 2 seconds.
Speed and distance traveled
Unlike velocity and displacement, which have technical defini-
tions, speed and distance traveled have commonsense meanings. 
Speed, of course, is what you read on your speedometer, and 
you can read distance traveled on your odometer or “tripometer.” 
Total distance traveled
To determine total distance, add the distances traveled on each 
leg of the yo-yo’s trip: the up leg, the down leg, and the second 
up leg.

 Chapter 7: Differentiation Problems 89
First, the yo-yo goes up from a height of 30 inches to about 
31.1 inches (where the first turn-around point is), a distance 
of about 1.1 inches. Next, it goes down from about 31.1 to 
about 16.9 (the height of the second turn-around point). 
That’s 31.1 – 16.9, or about 14.2 inches. Finally, it goes up 
again from about 16.9 to its final height of 18 inches, another 
1.1 inches. Add the three distances to get total distance trav-
elled: 
 inches.
Average speed
The yo-yo’s average speed is given by the total distance trav-
eled divided by the elapsed time. Thus,
Maximum and minimum speed
You previously determined the yo-yo’s maximum velocity (5 
inches per second) and its minimum velocity (
 inches per 
second). A velocity of 
 is a speed of 7, so that’s the yo-yo’s 
maximum speed. Its minimum speed of zero occurs at the two 
turnaround points.
 
For a continuous velocity function, the minimum speed is zero 
whenever the maximum and minimum velocities are of oppo-
site signs or when one of them is zero. When the maximum 
and minimum velocities are both positive or both negative, 
then the minimum speed is the lesser of the absolute values of 
the maximum and minimum velocities. In all cases, the maxi-
mum speed is the greater of the absolute values of the maxi-
mum and minimum velocities. Is that a mouthful or what?
Acceleration
Let’s go over acceleration: Put your pedal to the metal.
Positive and negative acceleration
The graph of the acceleration function at the bottom of 
Figure 7-2 is a simple line, 
. It’s easy to see that 
the acceleration of the yo-yo goes from a minimum of 
 at t = 0 seconds to a maximum of 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
90
12 
 at t = 4 seconds, and that the acceleration 
is zero at t = 2 when the yo-yo reaches its minimum velocity (and 
maximum speed). When the acceleration is negative — on the 
interval [0, 2) — that means that the velocity is decreasing. When 
the acceleration is positive — on the interval (2, 4] — the veloc-
ity is increasing. 
Speeding up and slowing down
Figuring out when the yo-yo is speeding up and slowing down 
is probably more interesting and descriptive of its motion 
than the info in the preceding section. An object is speeding 
up (what we call “acceleration” in everyday speech) whenever 
the velocity and the calculus acceleration are both positive 
or both negative. And an object is slowing down (what we call 
“deceleration”) when the velocity and the calculus accelera-
tion are of opposite signs.
Look at all three graphs in Figure 7-2 again. From t = 0 to about 
t = 0.47 (when velocity is zero), the velocity is positive and the 
acceleration is negative, so the yo-yo is slowing down (till it 
reaches its maximum height). When t = 0, the deceleration is 
greatest (12 
; the graph shows negative 12, 
but I’m calling it positive 12 because I’m calling it a decelera-
tion, get it?) From about t = 0.47 to t = 2, both velocity and 
acceleration are negative, so the yo-yo is speeding up. From 
t = 2 to about t = 3.53, velocity is positive and acceleration is 
negative, so the yo-yo is slowing down again (till it bottoms 
out at its lowest height). Finally, from about t = 3.53 to t = 4, 
both velocity and acceleration are positive, so the yo-yo is 
speeding up again. The yo-yo reaches its greatest acceleration 
of 12 
 at t = 4 seconds.
Tying it all together
Note the following connections among the three graphs in 
Figure 7-2. The negative section on the graph of 
 — from 
t = 0 to t = 2 — corresponds to a decreasing section of the graph 
of

Related Rates
Say you’re filling up your swimming pool; you know how fast 
water is coming out of your hose, and you want to calculate 
how fast the water level in the pool is rising. You know one 
rate (how fast the water is pouring in), and you want to deter-
mine another rate (how fast the water level is rising). These 
rates are called related rates because one depends on the 
other — the faster the water is poured in, the faster the water 
level rises. In a typical related rates problem, the rate or rates 
you’re given are unchanging, but the rate you have to figure 
out is changing with time. You have to determine this rate at 
one particular point in time.
A calculus crossroads
One car leaves an intersection traveling north at 50 mph; 
another is driving west toward the intersection at 40 mph. At 
one point, the north-bound car is three-tenths of a mile north 
of the intersection and the west-bound car is four-tenths of a 
mile east of it. At this point, how fast is the distance between 
the cars changing?
 
1. Draw a diagram and label it with any unchanging 
measurements (there are none in this particular 
problem), and make sure to assign a variable to 
anything in the problem that’s changing (unless it’s 
irrelevant to the problem). See Figure 7-3.
 
 Note that variables have been assigned to the dis-
tance between Car A and the intersection, the distance 
between Car B and the intersection, and the distance 
between the two cars, because those are changing 
distances. The 0.3 and 0.4 are in parentheses to 
emphasize that they’re not unchanging measurements; 
they’re the distances at one particular point in time.
 
 In related rates problems, it’s important to distinguish 
between what is changing and what is not changing.

 You may run across a similar problem in your calcu-
lus textbook. It involves a ladder leaning against and 
sliding down a wall. The diagram for this problem 
would be very similar to Figure 7-3 except that the 
y-axis would represent the wall, the x-axis would be 
the ground, and the diagonal line would be the ladder. 
Despite the similarities between these two problems, 
there’s an important difference: The distance between 
the cars is changing, so the diagonal line in Figure 7-3 
is labeled with a variable, s. A ladder, on the other 
hand, has a fixed length, so the diagonal line in the dia-
gram for the ladder problem would be labeled with a 
number, not a variable.
 
2. List all given rates and the rate you’re asked to 
determine as derivatives with respect to time.
 
 As Car A travels north, y is growing at 50 miles per 
hour. That’s a rate, a change in distance per change in 
time. So,
 
 

 Chapter 7: Differentiation Problems 93
 
 As Car B travels west, x is shrinking at 40 miles per 
hour. That’s a negative rate:
 
 
 
 You have to figure out how fast s is changing, so
 
 
 
3. Write the formula that relates the variables in the 
problem: x, y, and s.
 
 There’s a right triangle in your diagram, so you use 
the Pythagorean Theorem: 
.
 
 
 The Pythagorean Theorem is used a lot in related rates 
problems. If there’s a right triangle in your problem, 
it’s likely that 
 is the formula you’ll need.
 
4. Differentiate your formula with respect to time, t.
 
 When you differentiate in a related rates problem, all 
variables are treated like the ys are treated in a typical 
implicit differentiation problem.
 
  
 
5. Substitute known values for the rates and variables 
in the equation from Step 4, and then solve for the 
thing you’re asked to determine, 
.
 
 
 
 There’s a glitch here because you don’t know s (you’ll 
run into this glitch in some but not all related rates 
problems). No worries, just use the Pythagorean 
Theorem again.
 
 
 
 You can reject the negative answer because s obvi-
ously has a positive length. So s = 0.5.
 
 Now plug everything into your equation.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
94
 
 
 
 This negative answer means that the distance, s, is 
decreasing. Thus, when car A is 3 blocks north of the 
intersection and car B is 4 blocks east of the intersec-
tion, the distance between them is decreasing at a rate 
of 2 mph.
 
 Be sure to differentiate (Step 4) before you plug the 
given information into the unknowns (Step 5).
Filling up a trough
Here’s another garden-variety related rates problem. A trough 
is being filled up with swill. It’s 10 feet long, and its cross- 
section is an isosceles triangle with a base of 2 feet and a 
height of 2 feet 6 inches (with the vertex at the bottom, of 
course). Swill’s being poured in at a rate of 5 cubic feet per 
minute. When the depth of the swill is 1 foot 3 inches, how 
fast is the swill level rising?
 
1. Draw a diagram, labeling the diagram with any 
unchanging measurements and assigning variables 
to any changing things. See Figure 7-4.

Figure 7-4: Filling a trough with swill — lunch time.

 Chapter 7: Differentiation Problems 95
 
 Note that Figure 7-4 shows the unchanging dimensions 
of the trough, 2 feet, 2 feet 6 inches, and 10 feet, and 
that these dimensions do not have variable names like 
l for length or h for height. And note that the chang-
ing things — the height (or depth) of the swill and the 
width of the surface of the swill (which gets wider as 
the swill gets deeper) — have variable names, h for 
height and b for base (I call it base, not width, because 
it’s the base of the upside-down triangle shape made 
by the swill). The swill volume is also changing, so you 
can call that V, of course.
 
2. List all given rates and the rate you’re asked to 
figure out as derivatives with respect to time.
 
 
 
3.a. Write down the formula that connects the variables 
in the problem: V, h, and b. 
 
 Remember the formula for the volume of a right prism 
(the shape of the swill in the trough)?:
 
 
 
 Note that this “base” is the base of the prism (the 
whole triangle at the end of the trough), not the 
base of the triangle labeled b in Figure 7-4. Also, this 
“height” is the height of the prism (length of the 
trough), not the height labeled h in Figure 7-4. Sorry 
about the confusion. Deal with it.
 
 The area of the triangular base equals 
, and 
 
 the “height” of the prism is 10 feet, so the formula 
becomes
 
 
 
 This formula contains a variable, b, that you don’t see 
in your list of derivatives in Step 2. So Step 3 has a 
second part — getting rid of this extra variable.
 
3.b. Find an equation that relates the unwanted variable, 
b, to some other variable in the problem so you can 
make a substitution that leaves you with only V and h. 
 
 The triangular face of the swill in the trough is similar 
to the triangular face of the trough itself, so the base 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
96
and height of these triangles are proportional. (Recall 
from geometry that similar triangles are triangles 
of the same shape; their sides are proportional.) Thus,
 
 
 
 Similar triangles come up a lot in related rates prob-
lems. Look for them whenever the problem involves a 
triangle, a triangular prism, or a cone shape.
 
 Now substitute 0.8h for b in your formula from Step 3.a.
 
 
 
4. Differentiate this equation with respect to t.
 
 
 
5. Substitute known values for the rate and variable in 
the equation from Step 4 and then solve.
 
 You know that 
 cubic feet per minute, and you 
 
 want to determine 
 when h equals 1 foot 3 inches, 
 
 or 1.25 feet, so plug in 5 and 1.25 and solve for 
:
 
 
That’s it. The swill’s level is rising at a rate of 1/2 foot per 
minute when the swill is 1 foot 3 inches deep. Dig in.
Linear Approximation
Because ordinary functions are locally linear (straight) — 
and the further you zoom in on them, the straighter they 
look — a line tangent to a function is a good approximation 

 Chapter 7: Differentiation Problems 97
of the  function near the point of tangency. Figure 7-5 shows 
the graph of 
 and a line tangent to the function at 
the point (9, 3). Near (9, 3), the curve and the tangent line are 
 virtually indistinguishable.

 and a line tangent to the curve at (9, 3).
Determining the equation of this tangent line is a breeze. 
You’ve got a point, (9, 3), and the slope is given by the deriva-
tive of f at 9:
Now just take this slope, , and the point (9, 3), and plug them 
into the point-slope form:
That’s the equation of the line tangent to 
 at (9, 3). Are
you wondering why I wrote the equation as 
? It 
might seem more natural to put the 3 to the right of 
, 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
98
which, of course, would also be correct. And I could have 
simplified the equation further, writing it in y = mx + b form. I 
explain later in this section why I wrote it the way I did.
Now, say you want to approximate the square root of 10. 
Because 10 is pretty close to 9, and because you can see from 
Figure 7-5 that 
 and its tangent line are close to each 
other at x = 10, the y-coordinate of the line at x = 10 is a good 
approximation of the function value at x = 10, namely 
. Just 
plug 10 into the line equation for your approximation:
Thus, the square root of 10 is about 
. This is only about 
0.004 more than the exact answer of 3.1623.
Now I can explain why I wrote the equation for the tangent 
line the way I did. This form makes it easier to do the com-
putation and easier to understand what’s going on when 
you compute an approximation. You know that the line goes 
through the point (9, 3), right? And you know the slope of the 
line is . So, you can start at (9, 3) and go to the right (or left) 
along the line in the stair-step fashion, as shown in Figure 7-6: 
over 1, up ; over 1, up  ; and so on.

the left, you go down  for each 1 you go to the left. When the 
line equation is written in the above form, the computation of 
an approximation parallels this stair-step scheme.
Figure 7-6 shows the approximate values for the square roots 
of 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12. Here’s how you come up with these 
values: To get to 8, for example, from (9, 3), you go 1 to the 
left, so you go down  to 
; or to get to 11 from (9, 3), you go 
two to the right, so you go up two-sixths to 
 or

go to the right one half to

a twelfth, to

Below are the errors for the approximations shown in Figure 
7-6. Note that the errors grow as you get further from the point 
of tangency (9, 3); also, the errors grow faster going down from 
(9, 3) than going up from (9, 3) — errors often grow faster in 
one direction than the other with linear approximations.
 
Linear Approximation Equation: Here’s the general form 
for the equation of the tangent line for a linear approxima-
tion. The values of a function 
 can be approximated by 
the values of the tangent line

f you’re still reading, I presume you survived differentiation 
(Chapters 4–7). Now you begin the second major calculus 
topic: integration. Just as two simple ideas lie at the heart of 
 differentiation — rate (like miles per hour) and the slope of a 
curve — integration can also be understood in terms of two 
simple ideas: adding up small pieces of something and the area 
under a curve. 
Integration: Just Fancy Addition
Say you want to determine the volume of the lamp’s base in 
Figure 8-1. Because no formula for the volume of such a weird 
shape exists, you can’t calculate the volume directly. You can, 
however, calculate the volume with integration. Imagine that 
the base is cut up into thin, horizontal slices, as shown on the 
right in Figure 8-1.
Do you see how each slice is shaped like a thin pancake? Now, 
because there is a formula for the volume of a pancake (a pan-
cake is just a very short cylinder), you can determine the total 
volume of the base by simply calculating the volume of each 
pancake-shaped slice and then adding up the volumes. That’s 
integration in a nutshell.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
102
Figure 8-1:  A lamp with a curvy base and the base 
cut into thin horizontal slices.
What makes integration one of the great achievements in 
the history of mathematics is that — to stay with the lamp 
example — it gives you the exact volume of the lamp’s base by 
sort of cutting it into an infinite number of infinitely thin slices. 
If you cut the lamp into fewer than an infinite number of slices, 
you can get only a very good approximation of the volume 
because each slice will have a weird, curved edge which would 
cause a small error.
Integration has an elegant symbol: . You’ve probably seen it 
before. You can think of the integration symbol as an elongated 
S for “sum up.” So, for our lamp problem, you can write
where dB means a little bit of the base — actually an infinitely 
small piece. So the equation just means that if you sum up 
all the little pieces of the base from the bottom to the top, the 
result is B, the volume of the whole base.
This is a bit oversimplified — I can hear the siren of the math 
police now — but it’s a good way to think about integration. 
By the way, thinking of dB as a little or infinitesimal piece of B 
is an idea you saw before with differentiation (see Chapter 4), 
where the derivative or slope, 
, is equal to the ratio of a 
little bit of y to a little bit of x, as you shrink the slope stair 
step down to an infinitesimal size — see Figure 8-2.

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 103

∆y = rise

So, whenever you see something like
it just means that you add up all the little pieces of the 
mumbo jumbo from a to b to get the total of all of the mumbo 
jumbo from a to b. Or you might see something like
which means add up the little pieces of distance traveled 
between 0 and 20 seconds to get the total distance traveled in 
that time span.
To sum up — that’s a pun! — the mathematical expression to 
the right of the integration symbol always stands for a little 
bit of something, and integrating such an expression means 
to add up all the little pieces between some starting point and 
some ending point.
Finding the Area under a Curve
The most fundamental meaning of integration is to add up. 
And when you depict integration on a graph, you can see the 
adding up process as a summing up of little bits of area to 
arrive at the total area under a curve. Consider Figure 8-3.

104

Figure 8-3:  Integrating f(x) from a to b means finding the area 
under the curve between a and b.
The shaded area in Figure 8-3 can be calculated with the 
 following integral:
Look at the thin rectangle in Figure 8-3. It has a height of 
 
and a width of dx (a little bit of x), so its area (length × width, of 
course) is given by 
. The above integral tells you to add 
up the areas of all the narrow rectangular strips between a and b 
under the curve 
. As the strips get narrower and narrower, 
you get a better and better estimate of the area. The power of 
integration lies in the fact that it gives you the exact area by sort 
of adding up an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles. 
If you’re doing a problem where both the x and y axes are 
labeled in a unit of length, say, feet, then each thin rectangle 
measures so many feet by so many feet, and its area — length × 
width — is some number of square feet. In this case, when you 
integrate to get the total area under the curve between a and 
b, your final answer will be an amount of — what else? — area. 
But you can use this adding-up-areas-of-rectangles scheme to 
add up tiny bits of anything — distance, volume, or energy, 
for example. In other words, the area under the curve doesn’t 
have to stand for an actual area.

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 105
If, for example, the units on the x-axis are hours and the y-axis is 
labeled in miles per hour, then, because rate × time = distance, the 
area of each rectangle represents an amount of distance, and the 
total area gives you the total distance traveled during the given 
time interval. Or if the x-axis is labeled in hours and the y-axis 
in kilowatts of electrical power — in which case the curve gives 
power usage as a function of time — then the area of each rect-
angular strip (kilowatts × hours) represents a number of kilowatt-
hours of energy. In that case, the total area under the curve gives 
you the total number of kilowatt-hours of energy consumption 
between two points in time.
Dealing with negative area
In the examples involving volume, distance, and energy (see 
previous two sections), you’re adding up positive bits of 
something. This is common with practical problems because 
you can’t, say, have a negative volume of water or use a nega-
tive number of kilowatt-hours. However, you will sometimes 
integrate functions that go into the negatives — that’s below 
the x-axis. Here’s what you do.
 
When using integration to calculate area, area below the x-axis 
counts as negative area. The total area between a and b for 
 
some curve 
 — given by the integral 
 — is really 
 
a net area where the total area below the x-axis (and above the 
curve) is subtracted from the total area above the x-axis (and 
below the curve).
Approximating Area
Before explaining how to calculate exact areas, I want to show 
you how to approximate areas. The approximation method is 
useful not only because it lays the groundwork for the exact 
method — integration — but because for some curves, inte-
gration is impossible, and an approximation of area is the best 
you can do.
Approximating area with left sums
Say you want the exact area under the curve 
 
between 0 and 3. See the shaded area on the graph on the left 
in Figure 8-4.

Figure 8-4:  The exact area under 
 between 0 and 3 (left) is 
approximated by the area of three rectangles (right).
You can get a rough estimate of the area by drawing three 
rectangles under the curve, as shown on the right in 
Figure 8-4, and then adding up their areas.
The rectangles in Figure 8-4 represent a so-called left sum 
because the upper left corner of each rectangle touches the 
curve. Each rectangle has a width of 1 and the height of each 
is given by the height of the function at the rectangle’s left 
edge. So, rectangle number 1 has a height of 
;
its area (height  width) is thus 
, or 1. Rectangle 2 has a 
height of 
, so its area is 
, or 2. And rect-
angle 3 has a height of 
, so its area is 
, or 
5. Adding the areas gives you 1 + 2 + 5, or 8. This is an under-
estimate of the total area under the curve because of the gaps 
between the rectangles and the curve.
For a better estimate, double the number of rectangles to six. 
Figure 8-5 shows six “left” rectangles under the curve and also 
how they begin to fill up the three gaps you see in Figure 8-4.
See the three small, darker shaded rectangles in the graph on 
the right in Figure 8-5? They sit on top of the three rectangles 
from Figure 8-4, and they represent how much the area esti-
mate has improved by using six rectangles instead of three.
Now total up the areas of the six rectangles. Each has a 
width of 0.5 and the heights are 
 and 
so on. I’ll spare you the math. Here’s the total: 0.5 + 0.625 + 
1 + 1.625 + 2.5 + 3.625 = 9.875. This is a better estimate, but 

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 107
it’s still an underestimate because of the six small gaps you 
can see on the left graph in Figure 8-5.

The Left Rectangle Rule: You can approximate the exact area 
 
under a curve between a and b, 
, with a sum of left 
 
rectangles given by the following formula. In general, the more 
rectangles, the better the estimate.
Where n is the number of rectangles, 
 is the width of each 
one, and the function values are the heights of the rectangles.
Look back to the six rectangles shown in Figure 8-5. The width 
of each rectangle equals the length of the total span from 0 to 
3 (which of course is 3 – 0, or 3) divided by the number of 
rectangles, 6. That’s what the 
 does in the formula.
What about those xs with the subscripts? The x-coordinate of 
the left edge of rectangle 1 in Figure 8-5 is 
, the right edge of 
rectangle 1 (the same as the left edge of rectangle 2) is at 
,
the right edge of rectangle 2 is at 
, the right edge of rect-
angle 3 is at 
, and so on up to the right edge of rectangle 6, 
at 
. For the six rectangles in Figure 8-5, 
 is 0, 
 is 0.5, 
 is 
1, 
 is 1.5, 
 is 2, 
 is 2.5, and 
 is 3. The heights of the six 
left rectangles in Figure 8-5 occur at their left edges, which are 
at 
 through 
. You don’t use the right edge of the last rect-
angle, 
, in a left sum. That’s why the list of function values in 
the formula stops at 
.
Here’s how to use the formula for the six rectangles in Figure 8-5:

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 109
Had I distributed the width of 1/2 to each of the heights after the 
third line in that solution, you’d see the sum of the areas of the 
rectangles — seen just before Figure 8-5. The formula uses the 
shortcut of first adding up the heights and then multiplying by 
the width.
Approximating area 
with right sums
Now let’s estimate the same area under 
 from 0 
to 3 with right rectangles. This method works just like the left 
sum method except that each rectangle is drawn so that its 
right upper corner touches the curve. See Figure 8-6.

The Right Rectangle Rule: You can approximate the exact 
 
area under a curve between a and b, 
, with a sum of 
 
right rectangles given by the following formula. In general, the 
more rectangles, the better the estimate.
where n is the number of rectangles, 
 is the width of 
each, and the function values are the heights of the rectangles.
If you compare this formula to the one for a left rectangle 
sum, you get the complete picture about those subscripts. 
The two formulas are the same except for one thing. Look at 
the sums of the function values in both formulas. The right 
sum formula has one value, 
, that the left sum formula 
doesn’t have, and the left sum formula has one value, 
, 
that the right sum formula doesn’t have. All the function 
values between those two appear in both formulas. You can 
get a handle on this by comparing the three left rectangles 

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 111
from Figure 8-4 to the three right rectangles from Figure 8-6. 
Their areas and totals, which we calculated earlier, are
Three left rectangles: 
1 + 2 + 5 = 8
Three right rectangles: 2 + 5 + 10 = 17
The sums of the areas are the same except for the left-most 
left rectangle and the right-most right rectangle. Both sums 
include the rectangles with areas 2 and 5. Look at how the 
rectangles are constructed — the second and third rectangles 
in Figure 8-4 are the same as the first and second rectangles in 
Figure 8-6.
Approximating area 
with midpoint sums
A third way to approximate areas with rectangles is to make 
each rectangle cross the curve at the midpoint of its top side. 
A midpoint sum is a much better estimate of area than either a 
left or a right sum. Figure 8-7 shows why.

You can see in Figure 8-7 that the part of each rectangle that’s 
above the curve looks about the same size as the gap between 
the rectangle and the curve. A midpoint sum produces such 
a good estimate because these two errors roughly cancel out 
each other.
For the three rectangles in Figure 8-8, the widths are 1 and the 
heights are 
, 
, and 
. The 
total area comes to 11.75. Table 8-3 lists the midpoint sums 
for the same number of rectangles used in Tables 8-1 and 8-2.

Sorry to give away the ending, but you’ll soon see that the 
exact area is 12. And to see how much faster the midpoint 
approximations approach the exact answer of 12 than the left 
or right approximations, compare the three tables. The error 
with 6 midpoint rectangles is about the same as the error with 
192 left or right rectangles!
 
The Midpoint Rule: You can approximate the exact area 
 
under a curve between a and b, 
, with a sum of 
 
midpoint rectangles given by the following formula. In general, 
the more rectangles, the better the estimate.

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 113
where n is the number of rectangles, 
 is the width of each, 
and the function values are the heights of the rectangles.
 
The left, right, and midpoint sums are called Riemann sums after 
the great German mathematician G. F. B. Riemann (1826–66).
Summation Notation
For adding up long series of numbers like the rectangle areas 
in a left, right, or midpoint sum, summation or sigma notation 
is handy.
Summing up the basics
Say you wanted to add up the first 100 multiples of 5 — that’s 
from 5 to 500. You could write out the sum like this: 
5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + ......... + 490 + 495 + 500
But with sigma notation, the sum is much more condensed.
This notation just tells you to plug 1 in for the i in 5i, then plug 
2 into the i in 5i, then 3, then 4, all the way up to 100. Then 
you add up the results. So that’s 
 plus 
 plus 
, and 
so on, up to 
. It’s the same thing as writing out the sum 
the long way. By the way, the letter i has no significance. You
can write the sum with a j, 
, or any other letter you like.
Here’s one more. If you want to add up 
, you can write the sum with sigma notation as follows:

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
114
Writing Riemann sums 
with sigma notation
You can use sigma notation to write out the right-rectangle 
sum for the curve 
 from the “Approximating Area” 
sections. Recall the formula for a right sum from the  
“Approximating area with right sums” section:
Here’s the same formula written with sigma notation:
Now work this out for the six right rectangles in Figure 8-8. 
You’re figuring the area under 
 between 0 and 3 with six 
rectangles, so the width of each, 
. So 
now you’ve got

Figure 8-8:  Six right rectangles approximate the area under

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 115
Now, because the width of each rectangle is , the right edges 
of the six rectangles fall on the first six multiples of : 0.5, 1, 
1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3. These numbers are the x-coordinates of 
the six points 
 through 
; they can be generated by the 
expression 
, where i equals 1 through 6. You can check that 
this works by plugging 1 in for i in 
, then 2, then 3, up to 6. 
So now you can replace the  in the formula with 
, giving you
Our function, 
 so 
, and so now 
you can write
If you plug 1 into i, then 2, 3, up to 6 and do the math, you get the 
sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 8-8. This sigma nota-
tion is just a fancy way of writing the sum of the six rectangles.
Are we having fun? Hold on, it gets worse. Now you’re going to 
write out the general sum for an unknown number (n) of right 
rectangles. The total span of the area in question is 3, right? 
You divide this span by the number of rectangles to get the 
width of each rectangle. With 6 rectangles, the width of each 
is ; with n rectangles, the width of each is . And the right 
edges of the n rectangles are generated by 
, for i equals 1 
through n. That gives you
Or, because 
,

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
116
For this last step, you pull the 
 and the  through the 
summation signs — you’re allowed to pull out anything 
except for a function of i, the so-called index of summation. 
Also, the second summation in the last step has just a 1 after 
it and no i. So there’s nowhere to plug in the values of i. No 
worries — all you do is add up n 1s, which equals n (I do this 
in a minute).
With sleight of hand, you’re now going to turn the previous 
Riemann sum into a formula in terms of n. The sum of the 
first n square numbers, 
, equals 
 (a formula you might want to memorize). So, 
you can substitute that expression for 
 in the last line of 
the sigma notation solution, and at the same time substitute 
n for 
:
The end. Finally! This is the formula for the area of n right 
rectangles between 0 and 3 under the function 
. You can 
use this formula to produce the results given in Table 8-2. But 

 Chapter 8: Introduction to Integration 117
once you’ve got such a formula, it’d be kind of pointless to 
produce a table of approximate areas, because you can use 
the formula to determine the exact area. I get to that in the 
next section.
But first, here are the formulas for n left rectangles and n mid-
point rectangles between 0 and 3 under the function 
. 
These formulas generate the area approximations in Tables 8-1 
and 8-3. 
Finding Exact Area with 
the Definite Integral
As you saw with the left, right, and midpoint rectangles in the 
“Approximating Area” sections, the more rectangles you have, 
the better the approximation. So, “all” you have to do to get the 
exact area under a curve is to use an infinite number of rectan-
gles. Now, you can’t really do that, but with the fantastic inven-
tion of limits, this is sort of what happens. Here’s the definition 
of the definite integral that’s used to compute exact areas.
 
The Definite Integral (“simple” definition): The exact area 
under a curve between a and b is given by the definite integral, 
which is defined as the limit of a Riemann sum:
Is that a thing of beauty or what? The summation above is iden-
tical to the formula for n right rectangles, 
, from a few pages 
back. The only difference is that you take the limit of that for-
mula as the number of rectangles approaches infinity.
This definition of the definite integral is a simple version 
based on the right rectangle formula. I’ll skip the more compli-
cated real-McCoy definition because you’ll never need to use 
it. All Riemann sums have the same limit — it doesn’t matter 
what type of rectangles you use — so you might as well use 
this right-rectangle definition.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
118
Here, finally, is the exact area under 
 between 0 and 3:
 
(This is what we 
got in the “Writing 
Riemann sums with 
sigma notation” sec-
tion after all those 
steps.)
 
  
 
= 12 + 0 + 0     (Remember, in a limit prob-
lem, any number divided by 
infinity equals zero.)
 
= 12
Big surprise.

hapter 8 shows you the hard way to calculate the area 
under a curve using the formal definition of integration — 
the limit of a Riemann sum. In this chapter, I do it the easy 
way, taking advantage of one of the most important discover-
ies in mathematics — that integration is just differentiation in 
reverse.
Antidifferentiation: Reverse 
Differentiation 
Antidifferentiation is just differentiation backwards. The 
derivative of sin x is cos x, so the antiderivative of cos x is 
sin x; the derivative of 
 is 
, so the antiderivative of 
 is 
 — you just go backwards . . . with one twist: The derivative 
of 
 is also

. Any function 
of the form 
, where C is any number, has a derivative of

The Indefinite Integral: The indefinite integral of a function 
, written as 
, is the family of all antiderivatives of 
the function. For example, because the derivative of 
 is 
, 
the indefinite integral of 
 is 
, and you write
You may recognize this integration symbol, , from the definite 
integral in Chapter 8. The definite integral symbol, however, 
contains two little numbers like  that tell you to compute the 
area of a function between the two numbers, called the limits 
of integration. The naked version of the symbol, , indicates an 
indefinite integral or an antiderivative. This chapter is about 
the intimate connection between these two symbols.
Figure 9-1 shows the family of antiderivatives of the parabola 
, namely 
. Note that this family of curves has an 
infinite number of curves. They go up and down forever and 
are infinitely dense. The vertical gap of 2 units between each 
curve in Figure 9-1 is just a visual aid.

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 121
The top curve on the graph is 
; the one below it is 
; 
the bottom one is 
. By the power rule, these three func-
tions, as well as all the others in this family of functions, have 
a derivative of 
. Now consider the slope of each of the 
curves where x equals 1 (see the tangent lines drawn on the 
curves). The derivative of each curve is 
, so when x equals 
1, the slope of each curve is 
, or 3. Thus, all these little 
tangent lines are parallel. No matter what x-value you pick, 
tangent lines like this would be parallel. This is the visual way 
to understand why each of these curves has the same deriva-
tive, and, thus, why each curve is an antiderivative of the 
same function.
The Annoying Area Function
This topic is pretty tricky. Put on your thinking cap. Say 
you’ve got any old function, 
. Imagine that at some t-value, 
call it s, you draw a fixed vertical line. See Figure 9-2.
s
x
y
t

Figure 9-2: Area under f between s and x is swept out by the moving line at x.
Then you take a movable vertical line, starting at the same 
point, s (for starting point), and drag it to the right, sweeping 
out a larger and larger area under the curve. This area is a func-
tion of x, the position of the moving line. In symbols, you write
Note that t is the input variable in 
 instead of x because x 
is already taken — it’s the input variable in 
. The sub-
script f in 
 indicates that 
 is the area function for the 
particular curve f or 
. The dt is a little increment along the 
t-axis — actually an infinitesimally small increment.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
122
Here’s a simple example to make sure you’ve got a handle 
how an area function works. Say you’ve got the simple func-
tion, 
 — that’s a horizontal line at y = 10. If you sweep 
out area beginning at s = 3, you get the following area function:
You can see that the area swept out from 3 to 4 is 10 because, 
in dragging the line from 3 to 4, you sweep out a rectangle 
with a width of 1 and a height of 10, which has an area of 1 
times 10, or 10. See Figure 9-3. 
So, 
, the area swept out as you hit 4, equals 10. 
 
equals 20 because when you drag the line to 5, you’ve swept 
out a rectangle with a width of 2 and height of 10, which has 
an area of 2 times 10, or 20. 
 equals 30, and so on.
Now, imagine that you drag the line across at a rate of one unit 
per second. You start at x = 3, and you hit 4 at 1 second, 5 at 
2 seconds, 6 at 3 seconds, and so on. How much area are you 
sweeping out per second? Ten square units per second because 
each second you sweep out another 1-by-10 rectangle. 
Notice — this is huge — that because the width of each rect-
angle you sweep out is 1, the area of each rectangle — given 
by height times width — is the same as its height because any-
thing times 1 equals itself.

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 123
 
Okay, are you sitting down? You’ve reached another one of 
the big Ah ha! moments in the history of mathematics. Recall 
that a derivative is a rate. So, because the rate at which the 
previous area function grows is 10 square units per second, 
you can say its derivative equals 10. Thus, you can write
Here’s the critical thing: This rate or derivative of 10 is the 
same as the original function 
 because as you go 
across 1 unit, you sweep out a rectangle that has an area of 
10, the height of the function.
This works for any function, not just horizontal lines. Look at 
the function 
 and its area function 
 that sweeps out 
area beginning at s = 2 in Figure 9-4.

Figure 9-4:  Area under g between 2 and x is swept out by the moving verti-

You can see that 
 is about 20 because the area swept out 
between 2 and 3 has a width of 1 and the curved top of the 
“rectangle” has an average height of about 20. So, during this 
interval, the rate of growth of 
 is about 20 square units 
per second. Between 3 and 4, you sweep out about 15 square 
units of area because that’s roughly the average height of 
 
between 3 and 4. So, during second number two — the interval 
from x = 3 to x = 4 — the rate of growth of 
 is about 15.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
124
 
The rate of area being swept out under a curve by an area 
function at a given x-value is equal to the height of the curve 
at that x-value.
The Fundamental Theorem 
Sound the trumpets! Now that you’ve seen the connection 
between the rate of growth of an area function and the height 
of the given curve, you’re ready for what some say is one of 
the most important theorems in the history of mathematics:
 
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Given an area func-
tion 
 that sweeps out area under 
,
,
the rate at which area is being swept out is equal to the height 
of the original function. So, because the rate is the derivative, 
the derivative of the area function equals the original function:
.
Because 
, you can also write the above equa-
tion as follows:
Now, because the derivative of 
 is 
, 
 is by defi-
nition an antiderivative of 
. Check out how this works by 
returning to the simple function from the previous section, 
, and its area function, 
.
According to the Fundamental Theorem, 
. Thus 
 must be an antiderivative of 10; in other words, 
 is a func-
tion whose derivative is 10. Because any function of the form 
10x + C, where C is a number, has a derivative of 10, the anti-
derivative of 10 is 10x + C. The particular number C depends 
on your choice of s, the point where you start sweeping out 
area. For a particular choice of s, the area function will be the 

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 125
one function (out of all the functions in the family of curves 
10x + C) that crosses the x-axis at s. To figure out C, set the 
antiderivative equal to zero, plug the value of s into x, and 
solve for C. 
For this function with an antiderivative of 10x + C, if you start 
sweeping out area at, say, s = 0, then 
, so C = 0, and 
thus 
, or just 10x. If instead you start 
sweeping out area at 
 and define a new area function, 
, then 
, so C equals 20 and 
 is
thus 10x + 20. This area function is 20 more than 
, which 
starts at s = 0, because if you start at 
, you’ve already 
swept out an area of 20 by the time you get to zero.
And if you start sweeping out area at s = 3, 
, so 
 and the area function is 
. This 
function is 30 less than on 
 because with 
, you lose 
the 3-by-10 rectangle between 0 and 3 that 
 has.
 
The area swept out under the horizontal line 
, from 
some number s to x, is given by an antiderivative of 10, 
namely 10x + C, where the value of C depends on where you 
start sweeping out area.
For the next example, look again at the parabola 
, our 
friend from Chapter 8, and the discussion of Riemann sums. 
Flip back to Figure 8-5. Now you can finally compute the exact 
area (from 0 to 3) in that graph the easy way.
The area function for sweeping out area under 
 
is 
. By the Fundamental Theorem, 
, and so 
 is an antiderivative of 
. Any 
function of the form 
 has a derivative of 
 (try 
it), so that’s the antiderivative. For Figure 8-5, you want 
to sweep out area beginning at 0, so s = 0. Plug 0 into the 
antiderivative and solve for C: 
, so C = 0, and 
thus

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
126
The area swept out from 0 to 3 — which we did the hard way 
in Chapter 8 by computing the limit of a Riemann sum — is 
simply 
:
That was much less work than doing it the hard way. 
And after you know the area function that starts at zero, 
, it’s a snap to figure the area of other 
sections under the parabola that don’t start at zero. Say 
you want the area under the parabola between 2 and 3. 
You can compute it by subtracting the area between 0 and 
2 from the area between 0 and 3. You just figured the area 
between 0 and 3 — that’s 12. And the area between 0 and 2 is 
. So the area between 2 and 3 is 
, 
or 
. This subtraction method brings us to the next topic — 
the second version of the Fundamental Theorem.
Fundamental Theorem: Take Two
Now we finally arrive at the super-duper shortcut integration 
theorem. But first a warning. . . . 
 
When using an area function, the first version of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, or its second version, 
areas below the x-axis count as negative areas.
 
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (shortcut version): 
Let F be any antiderivative of the function f; then

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 127
This theorem gives you the super shortcut for computing a 
definite integral like 
, the area under the parabola 
 between 2 and 3. As I show in the previous section, you 
can get this area by subtracting the area between 0 and 2 from 
the area between 0 and 3, but to do that you need to know 
that the particular area function sweeping out area beginning 
at zero, 
, is 
 (with a C value of zero).
The beauty of the shortcut theorem is that you don’t have to 
even use an area function like 
. You just find 
any antiderivative, 
, of your function, and do the subtrac-
tion, 
. The simplest antiderivative to use is the one 
where C = 0. So here’s how you use the theorem to find the 
area under our parabola from 2 to 3. 
 is an anti-
derivative of 
 so, by the theorem,
 
 can be written as 
, and thus,
Granted, this is the same computation I did in the previous 
section using the area function with s = 0, but that’s only 
because for the 
 function, when s is zero, C is also zero. 
It’s sort of a coincidence, and it’s not true for all functions. 
But regardless of the function, the shortcut works, and you 
don’t have to worry about area functions or s or C. All you do 
is 
.
Here’s another example: What’s the area under 
 
between x = 3 and x = 5? The derivative of 
 is 
, so 
 is an 
antiderivative of 
, and thus

What could be simpler? And if one big shortcut wasn’t enough 
to make your day, Table 9-1 lists some rules about definite 
integrals that can make your life much easier.

Antiderivatives: Basic 
Techniques
This section gives some basic techniques for antiderivatives.
Reverse rules 
The easiest antiderivatives are ones that are the reverse of 
derivative rules you already know. These are automatic, one-
step antiderivatives with the exception of the reverse power 
rule, which is only slightly harder.

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 129
No-brainer reverse rules
You know that the derivative of sin x is cos x, so reversing 
that tells you that an antiderivative of cos x is sin x. What 
could be simpler? But don’t forget that all functions of the 
form sin x + C are antiderivatives of cos x. In symbols, you 
write

The slightly more difficult reverse power rule
By the power rule, you know that

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
130
Here’s the simple method for reversing the power rule. Use 
 for your function. Recall that the power rule says to 
 
1. Bring the power in front where it will multiply the 
rest of the derivative.
 
 
 
2. Reduce the power by one and simplify.
 
 
To reverse this process, reverse the order of the two steps 
and reverse the math within each step. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Increase the power by one.
 
 The 3 becomes a 4.
 
 
 
2. Divide by the new power and simplify.
 
 
 
 And thus you write 
.
 
Especially when you’re new to antidifferentiation, it’s a good 
idea to test your antiderivatives by differentiating them — you 
can ignore the C. If you get back to your original function, you 
know your antiderivative is correct.
With the antiderivative you just found and the second version 
of the Fundamental Theorem, you can determine the area 
under 
 between, say, 1 and 2:

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 131
Guess and check
The guess-and-check method works when the integrand (that’s 
the expression after the integral symbol not counting the dx, 
and it’s the thing you want to antidifferentiate) is close to a 
function that you know the reverse rule for. For example, 
say you want the antiderivative of 
. Well, you know 
that the derivative of sine is cosine. Reversing that tells 
you that the antiderivative of cosine is sine. So you might 
think that the antiderivative of 
 is 
. That’s 
your guess. Now check it by differentiating it to see if you 
get the original function, 
:
This result is very close to the original function, except for 
that extra coefficient of 2. In other words, the answer is 2 
times as much as what you want. Because you want half that 
result, try an antiderivative that’s half of your first guess: 
. Check this second guess by differentiating it, and 
you get the desired result.
Here’s another example. What’s the antiderivative of 
?
 
1. Guess the antiderivative.
 
 This looks sort of like a power rule problem, so try the 
 
 reverse power rule. The antiderivative of 
 is 
 by 
 
 the reverse power rule, so your guess is 
.
 
2. Check your guess by differentiating it.

3. Tweak your first guess.
 
 Your result, 
, is three times too much, so 
make your second guess a third of your first guess — 
that’s 
, or 
.
 
4. Check your second guess by differentiating it.
 
 
 
 This checks. You’re done. The antiderivative of 
 is 
The two previous examples show that guess and check works 
well when the function you want to antidifferentiate has an 
argument like 3x or 3x + 2 (where x is raised to the first power) 
instead of a plain old x. (Recall that in a function like 
, the 
5x is called the argument.) In this case, you just tweak your 
guess by the reciprocal of the coefficient of x — the 3 in 3x + 2, 
for example (the 2 in 3x + 2 has no effect on your answer). In 
fact, for these easy problems, you don’t really have to guess 
and check. You can immediately see how to tweak your 
guess. It becomes sort of a one-step process. If the function’s 
argument is more complicated than 3x + 2 — like the 
 in 
 — you have to try the next method, substitution.
Substitution
In the previous section, you can see why the first guess in 
each case didn’t work. When you differentiate the guess, the 
chain rule produces an extra constant: 2 in the first example, 
3 in the second. You then tweak the guesses with 1/2 and 1/3 
to compensate for the extra constant.
Now say you want the antiderivative of 
 and you guess 
that it is 
. Watch what happens when you differentiate 
 to check it.

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 133
Here the chain rule produces an extra 2x — because the 
derivative of 
 is 2x — but if you try to compensate for this 
by attaching a 
 to your guess, it won’t work. Try it.
So, guessing and checking doesn’t work for antidifferentiating 
 — actually no method works for this simple-looking 
integrand (not all functions have antiderivatives) — but your 
attempt at differentiation here reveals a new class of func-
tions that you can antidifferentiate. Because the derivative of 
 is 
, the antiderivative of 
 must be 
. This function, 
, is the type of function you 
antidifferentiate with the substitution method.
 
The substitution method works when the integrand contains 
a function and the derivative of the function’s argument — in 
other words, when it contains that extra thing produced by 
the chain rule — or something just like it except for a con-
stant. And the integrand must not contain anything else.
The derivative of 
 is 
 by the 
 rule and the chain 
rule. So, the antiderivative of 
 is 
. And if you were 
asked to find the antiderivative of  
, you would know 
that the substitution method would work because this expres-
sion contains 
, which is the derivative of the argument of 
, namely 
.
You may be wondering why this is called the substitution 
method. I show you why in a minute. But first, I want to 
point out that you don’t always have to use the step-by-step 
method. Assuming you understand why the antiderivative 
of 
 is 
, you may encounter problems where you 
can just see the antiderivative without doing any work. But 
whether or not you can just see the answers to problems 
like this one, the substitution method is a good one to learn 
because, for one thing, it has many uses in calculus and other 
areas of mathematics, and for another, your teacher may 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
134
require that you know it and use it. So here’s how to find the 
antiderivative of 
 with substitution.
 
1. Set u equal to the argument of the main function.
 
 The argument of 
 is 
, so you set u equal to 
.
 
2. Take the derivative of u with respect to x.
 
 
 
3. Solve for dx.
 
 
 
4. Make the substitutions.
 
 In 
, u takes the place of 
 and 
 takes 
 
 the place of dx. So now you’ve got 
. The 
 
 two 2xs cancel, giving you 
.
 
5. Antidifferentiate using the simple reverse rule.
 
 
 
6. Substitute 
 back in for u — coming full circle.
 
 u equals 
, so 
 goes in for the u:
 
 
 
 That’s it. So 
.
If the original problem had been 
 instead of 
, you follow the same steps except that in Step 
4, after making the substitution, you arrive at 
. 
The xs still cancel — that’s the important thing — but after 
canceling you get 
, which has that extra  in it. No 
worries. Just pull the  through the  giving you 
. 
Now you finish this problem just as you did above in Steps 5 
and 6, except for the extra . 

 Chapter 9: Integration: Backwards Differentiation 135
Because C is any old constant, 
 is still any old constant, so 
you can get rid of the  in front of the C. That may seem 
somewhat unmathematical, but it’s right. Thus, your final 
answer is 
. You should check this by differentiat-
ing it. 
Here are a few examples of antiderivatives you can do with 
the substitution method so you can learn how to spot them.
 
✓ 
 
 The derivative of 
 is 
, but you don’t have to pay 
any attention to the 3 in 
 or the 4 in the integrand. 
Because the integrand contains 
, and because it 
doesn’t contain any other extra stuff, substitution works. 
Try it.
 
✓ 
 
 The integrand contains a function, 
, as well as the 
derivative of its argument, tan x — which is 
. 
Because the integrand doesn’t contain any other extra 
stuff (except for the 10, which doesn’t matter), substitu-
tion works. Do it.
 
✓ 
 
 Because the integrand contains the derivative of sin x, 
namely cos x, and no other stuff except for the 2/3, sub-
stitution works. Go for it.
You can do the three problems just listed with a method that 
combines substitution and guess and check (as long as your 
teacher doesn’t insist that you show the six-step substitution 
solution). Try using this combo method to antidifferenti-
ate the first example, 
. First confirm that the 
integral fits the pattern for substitution — it does, as seen 
in the first checklist item. This confirmation is the only part 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
136
 substitution plays in the combo method. Now finish the prob-
lem with guess and check.
 
1. Make your guess.
 
 The antiderivative of cosine is sine, so a good guess 
for the antiderivative of 
 is 
.
 
2. Check your guess by differentiating it.
 
 
 
3. Tweak your guess.
 
 Your result from Step 2, 
, is 3/4 of what you 
want, 
, so make your guess 4/3 bigger (note 
that 4/3 is the reciprocal of 3/4). Your second guess is 
 
 thus 
.
 
4. Check this second guess by differentiating it.
 
 Oh, heck, skip this — your answer’s got to work.

 figure it wouldn’t hurt to give you a break from the kind 
of theoretical groundwork stuff that I lay on pretty thick in 
Chapter 9, so this chapter cuts to the chase and shows you 
just the nuts and bolts of several integration techniques. 
Integration by Parts 
The basic idea of integration by parts is to transform an inte-
gral you can’t do into a simple product minus an integral you 
can do. Here’s the formula:
 Integration by Parts: 
And here’s the method in a nutshell. What’s 
? 
First, you’ve got to split up the integrand into a u and a dv so 
that it fits the formula. For this problem, choose 
 to be 
your u. Then everything else is the dv, namely 
. (I show 
you how to choose u in the next section.) Next, you differenti-
ate u to get your du, and you integrate dv to get your v. Finally, 
you plug everything into the formula and you’re home free. 
 
To help keep everything straight, organize integration-by-parts 
problems with a box like the one on the left in Figure 10-1. For 
each new problem, draw an empty 2-by-2 box, then put your u 
in the upper-left corner and your dv in the lower-right corner. 
The box for the above problem is on the right in Figure 10-1.

Ready to finish? Plug everything into the formula:
 
 
In the last step, you replace the 
 with C because 
 times 
any old number is still just any old number.

 Chapter 10: Integration for Experts 139
Picking your u
Here’s a great mnemonic for how to choose the u (again, once 
you’ve picked your u, everything else is the dv).
 
Herbert E. Kasube came up with the acronym LIATE to help 
you choose your u (calculus nerds can check out Herb’s arti-
cle in the American Mathematical Monthly 90, 1983 issue):
L Logarithmic 
(like log(x))
I Inverse trigonometric 
(like arctan(x))
A Algebraic 
(like 
)
T Trigonometric 
(like cos(x))
E Exponential 
(like 
)
To pick your u, go down this list; the first type of function on 
it that appears in the integrand is the u. Example: Integrate 
. (Integration by parts sometimes works for inte-
grands like this one that contain only a single function.)
 
1. Go down the LIATE list and pick the u.
 
 You see that there are no logarithmic functions in 
, but there is an inverse trigonometric 
function, 
. So that’s your u. Everything else 
is your dv, namely, plain old dx.
 
2. Do the box thing. See Figure 10-3.

3. Plug everything into the integration-by-parts formula.
 
 
 
 Now you can finish this problem by integrating 
 
 
 with the substitution method, setting 
 
 
 . Try it. Note that the u in 
 has noth-
ing to do with integration-by-parts u. Your final answer 
 
 should be 
.
Here’s another one. Integrate 
.
 
1. Go down the LIATE list and pick the u.
 
 Going down the LIATE list, the first type of function 
you find in 
 is a very simple algebraic one, 
namely x, so that’s your u.

 should be

Tricky Trig Integrals
In this section, you integrate powers of the six trigonometric 
functions, like 
 and 
, and products or 
quotients of trig functions, like 
 and 
. This is a bit tedious — time for some caffeine.
To use the following techniques, you must have an integrand 
that contains just one of the six trig functions like 
 
or a certain pairing of trig functions, like 
.
If the integrand has two trig functions, the two must be one 
of these three pairs: sine with cosine, secant with tangent, 
or cosecant with cotangent. For an integrand containing 
something other than one of these pairs, you can convert the 
problem into one of these pairs by using trig identities like 
 and 
. For instance,
After any needed conversions, you get one of three cases:
where either m or n is a positive integer.
 
Positive powers of trig functions are generally preferable 
to negative powers, so, for example, you want to convert 
 into 
.  

Calculus Essentials For Dummies

Sines and cosines
This section covers integrals containing sines and cosines.
Case 1: The power of sine is odd and positive 
If the power of sine is odd and positive, lop off one sine factor 
and put it to the right of the rest of the expression, convert 
the remaining sine factors to cosines with the Pythagorean 
identity, and then integrate with the substitution method 
where 
.
 
The Pythagorean identity tells you that, for any angle x, 
. And thus 
 and 
. 
Now integrate 
.
 
1. Lop off one sine factor and move it to the right.
 
 
 
2. Convert the remaining sines to cosines using the 
Pythagorean identity and simplify.
 
 
 
3. Integrate with substitution, where 
.
 
 
 
 You can save a little time in all substitution problems 
by just solving for du — as I did immediately above — 
and not bothering to solve for dx. You then tweak the 
integral so that it contains the thing du equals 
(
) in this problem. The integral contains 
a 
, so you multiply it by 
 to turn it into 
 and then compensate for that 
 by multi-
plying the whole integral by 
. This is a wash because 

 Chapter 10: Integration for Experts 143
 times 
 equals 1. This may not sound like much 
of a shortcut, but it’s a good time-saver once you get 
used to it. 
 
 So tweak your integral:
 
 Now substitute and solve by the reverse power rule:
Case 2: The power of cosine is odd and positive
This problem works exactly like Case 1, except that the roles 
of sine and cosine are reversed. Find 
.
 
1. Lop off one cosine factor and move it to the right.
 
 
 
2. Convert the remaining cosines to sines with the 
Pythagorean identity and simplify.
 
 
 
3. Integrate with substitution, where 
.
 
 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
144
 
 Now substitute:
 
 
 
 And finish integrating as in Case 1.
Case 3: The powers of both sine and cosine are even and 
nonnegative
Here you convert the integrand into odd powers of cosines by 
using the following trig identities:
 
 
 
Then you finish the problem as in Case 2. Here’s an example:
 
The first in this string of integrals is a no-brainer; the second 
is a simple reverse rule with a little tweak for the 2; you do the 
third integral by using the 
 identity a second time; and 
the fourth integral is handled by following the steps in Case 2. 
Do it. Your final answer should be
Secants and tangents
This section covers integrals — are you sitting down? — 
 containing secants and tangents!
Case 1: The power of tangent is odd and positive 
Integrate 
.

 Chapter 10: Integration for Experts 145
 
1. Lop off a secant-tangent factor and move it to the 
right.
 
 First, rewrite the problem: 
.
 
 Taking a secant-tangent factor out of 
 
may seem like squeezing blood from a turnip because 
 has a power less than 
, but it works:
 
 
 
2. Convert the remaining tangents to secants with the 
tangent-secant version of the Pythagorean identity.
 
 The Pythagorean identity is 
, and 
thus 
. Now make the switch.
 
 
 
3. Solve by substitution with 
 and 
.
 
 
Case 2: The power of secant is even and positive
Find 
.
 
1. Lop off a 
 factor and move it to the right.
 
 
 
2. Convert the remaining secants to tangents with the 
Pythagorean identity, 
.

3. Solve by substitution, where 
 and 
.
 
 
Case 3: The power of tangent is even and positive and 
there are no secant factors 
Integrate 
.
 
1. Convert one 
 factor to secants using the 
Pythagorean identity, 
.
 
 
 
2. Distribute and split up the integral.
 
 
 
3. Solve the first integral like in Step 3 of Case 2 for 
secants and tangents.
 
 You should get 
.
 
4. For the second integral from Step 2, go back to Step 
1 and repeat the process.
 
 For this piece of the problem, you get 
 
 
.
 
5. Repeat Step 3 for 
 (using Case 2, 
Step 3) for secants and tangents again).
 
 
 
6. Use the Pythagorean identity to convert the 
 from Step 4 into 
. 
 
 Both of these integrals can be done with simple 
reverse differentiation rules. After collecting all these 
pieces — piece 1 from Step 3, piece 2 from Step 5, and 
pieces 3 and 4 from Step 6 — your final answer should 
 
 be 
.

 Chapter 10: Integration for Experts 147
Cosecants and cotangents
Cosecant and cotangent integrals work exactly like the three 
cases for secants and tangents — you just use a different form 
of the Pythagorean identity: 
. Try this one:
Integrate 
. If you get 
, 
pass “Go” and collect $200.
 
If you get a secant-tangent or a cosecant-cotangent problem 
that doesn’t fit any of the cases discussed in the previous 
section or if you’re otherwise stumped by a problem, try 
converting it to sines and cosines and solving it with one 
of the sine-cosine methods or with identities like 
 
 and 
.
Trigonometric Substitution
With the trigonometric substitution method, you can do 
integrals containing radicals of the following forms: 
, 
, and 
 (as well as powers of those 
roots), where a is a constant and u is an expression contain-
ing x. For instance, 
 is of the form 
.
I’ve got some silly mnemonic tricks to help you keep the three 
cases of this method straight. (Remember, with mnemonic 
devices, silly works.) First, the three cases involve three trig 
functions, tangent, sine, and secant. Their initial letters, t, s, 
and s, are the same letters as the initial letters of the name of 
this technique, trigonometric substitution. Pretty nice, eh?
Table 10-1 shows how these three trig functions pair up with 
the radical forms listed in the opening paragraph.
Table 10-1 
A Totally Radical Table
 
 
 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
148
To keep these pairings straight, note that the plus sign in 
 looks like a little t for tangent, and that the other two 
forms, 
 and 
, contain a subtraction sign — s is 
for sine and secant. To memorize what sine and secant pair up 
with, note that 
 begins with the letter a, and it’s a sin 
to call someone an ass. Okay, I admit this is pretty weak. If you 
can come up with a better mnemonic, use it!
Case 1: Tangents
Find 
. First, note that this can be rewritten as 
, so it fits the form 
, where u = 3x and a = 2.
 
1. Draw a right triangle — basically a SohCahToa tri-
angle — where 
 equals  , which is 
. 
 
 Because you know that 
 (from SohCahToa), 
 
 your triangle should have 3x as O, the side opposite 
the angle , and 2 as A, the adjacent side. Then, by the 
Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the hypotenuse 
 
 automatically equals your radical, 
, or 
. See Figure 10-5.

2. Solve 
 for x, differentiate, and solve for dx.
 
 

 Chapter 10: Integration for Experts 149
 
 
 
3. Find which trig function is represented by the radi-
cal over the a and then solve for the radical.
 
 Look at the triangle in Figure 10-5. The radical is the 
 
 hypotenuse and a is 2, the adjacent side, so 
 is 
 
 
, which equals secant. So 
, and thus
 
 
.
 
4. Use the results from Steps 2 and 3 to make substitu-
tions in the original problem, then integrate.
 
 From Steps 2 and 3 you have 
 and 
. Now you can finally do the 
integration.
 
 
 
 
5. Substitute the x expressions from Steps 1 and 3 back 
in for 
 and 
. You can also get the expres-
sions from the triangle in Figure 10-5.
 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
150
 
For all three cases in trigonometric substitution, Step 1 always 
involves drawing a triangle in which the trig function in ques-
tion equals :
 
For all three cases, Step 3 always involves putting the radical 
over the a. The three cases are given below, but you don’t 
need to memorize the trig functions in this list because you’ll 
know which one you’ve got by just looking at the triangle—
assuming you know SohCahToa and the reciprocal trig func-
tions. I’ve left out what goes under the radicals because by 
the time you’re doing Step 3, you’ve already got the right radi-
cal expression.
Just remember  for Step 1 and 
 for Step 3.
Case 2: Sines
Integrate 
, rewriting it first as 
 so that 
it fits the form 
, where a = 4 and u = x.
 
1. Draw a right triangle where 
, which is .
 
 Sine equals 
, so the opposite side is x and the 
 
 hypotenuse is 4. The length of the adjacent side is 
 
 then automatically equal to your radical, 
. 
See Figure 10-6.

3. Find which trig function equals the radical over the 
a, and then solve for the radical.
 
 Look at the triangle in Figure 10-6. The radical, 
 
 
, over the a, 4, is 
, which you know from 
 
 SohCahToa equals cosine. So that gives you
 
 
 
4. Use the results from Steps 2 and 3 to make substitu-
tions in the original problem, then integrate.
 
 Note that in this particular problem, you have to 
make three substitutions, not just two like in the first 
example. From Steps 2 and 3 you’ve got 
, 
, and 
, so

5. The triangle shows that 
. Substitute 
back for your final answer.
 
 
Case 3: Secants
In the interest of space — and sanity — let’s skip this case. 
But you won’t have any trouble with it, because all the steps 
are basically the same as in Cases 1 and 2. Try this one. 
Integrate 
. I’ll get you started. In Step 1, you draw
a triangle, where 
, that’s . Now take it from there. 
You should get: 
.
Partial Fractions 
You use the partial fractions method to integrate rational 
functions like 
. The basic idea involves “unadding” 
a fraction. Adding works like this: 
. So you can “unadd”
  by splitting it up into  plus . This is what you do with the 
partial fraction technique except that you do it with compli-
cated rational functions instead of ordinary fractions.
Case 1: The denominator contains 
only linear factors
Integrate 
. This is Case 1 because the factored 
denominator (see Step 1) contains only linear factors. 

 Chapter 10: Integration for Experts 153
 
1. Factor the denominator.
 
 
 
2. Break up the fraction on the right into a sum of 
fractions, where each factor of the denominator in 
Step 1 becomes the denominator of a separate frac-
tion. Then put unknowns in the numerator of each 
fraction.
 
 
 
3. Multiply both sides of this equation by the denomi-
nator of the left side. 
 
 
 
4. Take the roots of the linear factors and plug them — 
one at a time — into x in the equation from Step 3, 
and solve for the unknowns.
 
 
 
 
5. Plug these results into the A and B in the equation 
from Step 2.
 
 
 
6. Split up the original integral into the partial frac-
tions from Step 5 and you’re home free.
 
 
Case 2: The denominator contains 
unfactorable quadratic factors
Sometimes you can’t factor a denominator all the way down 
to linear factors because some quadratics can’t be factored. 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
154
Here’s a problem: Integrate 
.
 
1. Factor the denominator.
 
 It’s already done! Note that 
 can’t be factored.
 
2. Break up the fraction into a sum of “partial fractions.”
 
 If you have an irreducible quadratic factor (like the 
), the numerator for that partial fraction needs 
two unknowns in the form Px + Q. 
 
 
 
3. Multiply both sides of this equation by the left-side 
denominator.
 
4. Take the roots of the linear factors and plug them — 
one at a time — into x in the equation from Step 3, 
and then solve.
 
 
  
 
 
 Unlike in the Case 1 example, you can’t solve for all 
the unknowns by plugging in the roots of the linear 
factors, so you have more work to do.
 
5. Plug into the Step 3 equation the known values of A 
and B and any two values for x not used in Step 4 to 
get a system of two equations in C and D.
 
 A = 1 and B = 2, so
 
 
 
 
6. Solve the system: 
 and 
.
 
 You should get C = 2 and D = 3. 

 Chapter 10: Integration for Experts 155
 
7. Split up the original integral and integrate.
 
 Using the values obtained in Steps 4 and 6, A = 1, B = 2, 
C = 2, and D = 3, and the equation from Step 2, you can 
split up the original integral into three pieces:
 
 
 And with basic algebra, you can split up the third inte-
gral on the right into two pieces, resulting in the final 
partial fraction decomposition:
 
 
 The first two integrals are easy. For the third, you use 
substitution with 
 and du = 2xdx. The fourth 
is done with the arctangent rule which you should 
 
 memorize: 
.
 
Case 3: The denominator contains 
repeated factors
If the denominator contains any repeated factors (linear or 
quadratic), like 
, here’s what you do: Say you want to
integrate 
. The x in the denominator has a
power of 2, so you get 2 partial fractions for the x (for the

. I’m skipping the solutions for these examples. 
The method’s the same as in Cases 1 and 2 above — just 
messier.
Equating coefficients
Here’s another method for finding your capital letter 
unknowns that you should have in your bag of tricks. Say you 
get the following for your Step 3 equation:
This equation has no linear factors, so you can’t plug in the 
roots to get the unknowns. Instead, expand the right side of 
the equation:
And collect like terms:
Then equate the coefficients of like terms from the left and 
right sides of the equation:
You then solve this system of simultaneous equations to get 
A, B, C, and D.
 
In a nutshell, you have three ways to find your A, B, C, etc.: 1) 
Plugging in the roots of the linear factors of the denominator 
if there are any, 2) Plugging in other values of x and solving 
the resulting system of equations, and 3) Equating the coef-
ficients of like terms. With practice, you’ll get good at combin-
ing these methods to find your unknowns quickly.

s I say in Chapter 8, integration is basically adding up 
small pieces of something to get the total for the whole 
thing — really small pieces, actually, infinitely small pieces. 
Thus, the integral
tells you to add up all the little pieces of distance traveled 
during the 15-second interval from 5 to 20 seconds to get the 
total distance traveled during that interval. In all problems, 
the little piece after the integration symbol is always an 
expression in x (or other variable). For the above integral, for 
instance, the little piece of distance might be given by, say, 
. Then the definite integral
 
would give you the total distance traveled. Your main chal-
lenge in this chapter is simply to come up with the algebraic 
expression for the little pieces you’re adding up. Before we 
begin the adding-up problems, I want to cover a couple other 
integration topics.

The Mean Value Theorem for

Figure 11-1: A visual “proof” of the mean value theorem for integrals.
The graph on the left in Figure 11-1 shows a rectangle whose 
area is clearly less than the area under the curve between 2 
and 5. This rectangle has a height equal to the lowest point on 
the curve in the interval from 2 to 5. The middle graph shows 
a rectangle whose height equals the highest point on the 
curve. Its area is clearly greater than the area under the curve. 
By now you’re thinking, “Isn’t there a rectangle taller than the 
short one and shorter than the tall one whose area is the same 
as the area under the curve?” Of course. And this rectangle 
obviously crosses the curve somewhere in the interval. This 
so-called “mean value rectangle,” shown on the right, basi-
cally sums up the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. It’s really 
just common sense. But here’s the mumbo jumbo.
 
The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals: If 
 is a continu-
ous function on the closed interval [a, b], then there exists a 
number c in the closed interval such that
The theorem basically just guarantees the existence of the 
mean value rectangle.

 Chapter 11: Using the Integral to Solve Problems 159
The area of the mean value rectangle — which is the same as 
the area under the curve — equals length times width, or base 
times height, right? So, if you divide its area, 
, by its 
base, 
, you get its height, 
. This height is the aver-
age value of the function over the interval in question.
 
Average Value: The average value of a function 
 over a 
closed interval [a, b] is
which is the height of the mean value rectangle.
Here’s an example: What’s the average speed of a car between 
t = 9 seconds and t = 16 seconds whose speed in feet per 
second is given by the function 
? According to the 
definition of average value, this average speed is given by
.
 
1. Determine the area under the curve between 9 and 16.
 
 
 
 This area, by the way, is the total distance traveled 
from 9 to 16 seconds. Do you see why? Consider the 
mean value rectangle to answer this question. Its 
height is a speed (because the function values, or 
heights, are speeds) and its base is an amount of time, 
so its area is speed times time which equals distance.
 
2. Divide this area, total distance, by the time interval 
from 9 to 16, namely 7.
 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
160
 
 The definition of average value tells you to multiply 
 
 the total area by 
, which in this problem is 
, 
 
 or . But because dividing by 7 is the same as multi-
 
 plying by , you can divide like I do in this step. It 
 
 makes more sense to think about these problems in 
terms of division: area equals base times height, so 
the height of the mean value rectangle equals its area 
divided by its base.
The Area between Two Curves 
This is the first of seven topics in this chapter where your 
task is to come up with an expression for a little bit of some-
thing and then add up the bits by integrating. For this first 
problem type, the little bit is a narrow rectangle that sits on 
one curve and goes up to another. Here’s an example: Find 
the area between 
 and 
 from x = 0 to x = 1. See 
Figure 11-2.

To get the height of the representative rectangle in Figure 11-2, 
subtract the y-coordinate of its bottom from the y-coordinate 
of its top — that’s 
. Its base is the infinitesimal dx. 
So, because area equals height times base, 

 Chapter 11: Using the Integral to Solve Problems 161
Now add up the areas of all rectangles from 0 to 1 by integrating:
To make things a little more twisted, in the next problem the 
curves cross (see Figure 11-3). When this happens, you have 
to split the total shaded area into two separate regions before 
integrating. Find the area between 
 and 
 from x = 0 to x = 2.

Volumes of Weird Solids
Integration enables you to calculate the volumes of shapes 
that you can’t get with basic geometry formulas.
The meat-slicer method
This metaphor is actually quite accurate. Picture a hunk 
of meat being cut into very thin slices on one of those deli 
meat slicers. That’s the basic idea here. You slice up a three- 
dimensional shape, then add up the volumes of the slices to 
determine the total volume.

 Chapter 11: Using the Integral to Solve Problems 163
Here’s a problem: What’s the volume of the solid whose length 
runs along the x-axis from 0 to  and whose cross sections 
perpendicular to the x-axis are equilateral triangles such that 
the midpoints of their bases lie on the x-axis and their top 
vertices are on the curve 
? Is that a mouthful or 
what? This problem is almost harder to describe and to pic-
ture than it is to do. Take a look at this thing in Figure 11-4.

So what’s the volume?
 
1. Determine the area of any old cross section.
 
 Each cross section is an equilateral triangle with a 
height of 
. If you do the geometry, you’ll see 
 
 that its base is

 (Hint: Half of an equilateral triangle is a 30°-60°-90° 
 
 triangle). So, the triangle’s area, given by

2. Find the volume of a representative slice.
 
 The volume of a slice is just its cross-sectional area 
times its infinitesimal thickness, dx. So you’ve got its 
volume:

3. Add up the volumes of the slices from 0 to  by 
integrating.
 
 
The disk method
This technique is a special case of the meat slicer method 
that you use when the cross-sections are all circles. Find the 
volume of the solid — between x = 2 and x = 3 — generated by 
rotating the curve 
 about the x-axis. See Figure 11-5.
 
1. Determine the area of any old cross section or repre-
sentative disk.
 
 Each cross section is a circle with a radius of

its area is given by the formula for the area of a circle, 
. Plugging

 It should take very little trial and error to see that

 intersect at x = 0 and x = 1. So the 
solid in question spans the interval on the x-axis 
from 0 to 1.
 
2. Figure the area of a thin cross-sectional washer.
 
 Each slice has the shape of a washer — see 
Figure 11-7 — so its area equals the area of the entire 
circle minus the area of the hole.

The matryoshka doll method
Now you’re going to cut up a solid into thin concentric cyl-
inders and then add up the volumes of all the cylinders. It’s 
kinda like how those nested Russian (matryoshka) dolls fit 
inside each other. Or imagine a soup can that somehow has 
many paper labels, each one covering the one beneath it. Or 
picture one of those clothes de-linters with the sticky papers 
you peel off. Each soup can label or piece of sticky paper is a 
cylindrical shell — before you tear it off, of course. After you 
tear it off, it’s an ordinary rectangle.
Here’s a problem: A solid is generated by taking the area 
bounded by the x-axis, the lines x = 2, x = 3, and 
, and 
then revolving it about the y-axis. What’s its volume? See 
Figure 11-8.

Figure 11-8:  A shape sort of like the Roman Coliseum and one of its 
representative shells.

 Chapter 11: Using the Integral to Solve Problems 169
 
1. Determine the area of a representative cylindrical 
shell.
 
 When picturing a representative shell, focus on one 
that’s in no place in particular. Figure 11-8 shows such 
a generic shell. Its radius is unknown, x, and its height 
is the height of the curve at x, namely 
. If, instead, 
you use a special shell like the outermost shell with a 
radius of 3, you’re more likely to make the mistake of 
thinking that a representative shell has some known 
radius like 3 or a known height like 
. Both the radius 
and the height are unknown. (This advice also applies 
to disk and washer problems.)
 
 Each representative shell, like the soup can label or 
the sticky sheet from a de-linter, is just a rectangle 
whose area is, of course, length times width. The 
rectangular soup can label goes all the way around 
the can, so its length is the circumference of the can, 
namely 
; the width of the label is the height of the 
can. So now you’ve got the general formula for the 
area of a representative shell:
 
 
 
 For the current problem, you plug in x for the radius 
and 
 for the height, giving you the area of a repre-
sentative shell:
 
 
 
2. Multiply the area by the thickness of the shell, dx, to 
get its volume.
 
 
 
3. Add up the volumes of all the shells from 2 to 3 by 
integrating.
 
 

Calculus Essentials For Dummies

With the meat-slicer, disk, and washer methods, it’s usually 
pretty obvious what the limits of integration should be (recall 
 
that the limits of integration are, for example, the 1 and 5 in ). 
 
With cylindrical shells, however, it’s not always as clear. A 
tip: You integrate from the right edge of the smallest cylinder 
to the right edge of the biggest cylinder (like from 2 to 3 in the 
previous problem). And note that you never integrate from 
the left edge to the right edge of the biggest cylinder (like 
from 
 to 3).
Arc Length
So far in this chapter, you’ve added up the areas of thin 
rectangles to get total area, and the volumes of thin slices or 
thin cylinders to get total volume. Now, you’re going to add 
up minute lengths along a curve, an “arc,” to get the whole 
length. The idea is to divide a length of curve into small sec-
tions, figure the length of each, and then add them all up. 
Figure 11-9 shows how each section of a curve is approxi-
mated by the hypotenuse of a tiny right triangle.

Figure 11-9:  The Pythagorean Theorem, 
, is the key to the arc 
length formula.

 Chapter 11: Using the Integral to Solve Problems 171
You can imagine that as you zoom in further and further, 
dividing the curve into more and more sections, the minute 
sections get straighter and straighter and the hypotenuses 
become better and better approximations of the curve. So, 
all you have to do is add up all the hypotenuses along the 
curve between your start and finish points. The lengths of 
the legs of each infinitesimal triangle are dx and dy, and thus 
the length of the hypotenuse — given by the Pythagorean 
Theorem — is
To add up all the hypotenuses from a to b along the curve, 
you just integrate:
A little tweaking and you have the formula for arc length. 
First, factor out a 
 under the square root and simplify:
Now you take the square root of 
 — that’s dx, of course — 
bring it outside the radical, and, voilà, you’ve got the formula.
 
Arc Length: The arc length along a curve, 
, from a to b, 
is given by the following integral:
The expression inside this integral is simply the length of a 
representative hypotenuse. 
Try this: What’s the length along 
 from x = 1 to x = 5?

1. Take the derivative of your function.
 
 
 
2. Plug this into the formula and integrate.
 
 
 
 (See how I got that? It’s the guess-and-check integration 
technique with the reverse power rule. The 4/9 is the 
tweak amount you need because of the coefficient 9/4.)
 
 
Improper Integrals
Definite integrals are improper when they go infinitely far up, 
down, right, or left. They go up or down infinitely far in prob-
lems like 
 that have one or more vertical asymptotes. 
They go infinitely far to the right or left in problems like 
 
or 
, where one or both of the limits of integration is 

 Chapter 11: Using the Integral to Solve Problems 173
infinite. It would make sense to use the term infinite instead 
of improper to describe these integrals, except that many of 
these “infinite” integrals have finite area. More about this in 
a minute.
You solve both types of improper integrals by turning them 
into limit problems. Take a look at some examples.
Improper integrals with 
vertical asymptotes
A vertical asymptote may be at the edge of the area in ques-
tion or in the middle of it.
A vertical asymptote at one of the limits of integration
What’s the area under 
 from 0 to 1? This function is 
undefined at x = 0, and it has a vertical asymptote there. So 
you’ve got to turn the definite integral into a limit:
 
This area is infinite, which probably doesn’t surprise you 
because the curve goes up to infinity. But hold on to your 
hat — the next function also goes up to infinity at x = 0, but its 
area is finite!
Find the area under 
 from 0 to 1. This function is also 
undefined at x = 0, so the solution process is the same as in 
the previous example.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
174
 
Convergence and Divergence: You say that an improper 
integral converges if the limit exists, that is, if the limit equals 
a finite number like in the second example. Otherwise, an 
improper integral is said to diverge — like in the first example. 
When an improper integral diverges, the area in question (or 
part of it) usually equals 
.
A vertical asymptote between the limits of integration
If the undefined point of the integrand is somewhere in 
between the limits of integration, you split the integral in 
two — at the undefined point — then turn each integral into 
a limit and go from there. Evaluate 
. This integrand is 
undefined at x = 0.
 
1. Split the integral in two at the undefined point.
 
 
 
2. Turn each integral into a limit and evaluate.
 
 For the  integral, the area is to the left of zero, so c 
 
 approaches zero from the left. For the  integral, the 
 
 area is to the right of zero, so c approaches zero from 
the right.
 
 

 Chapter 11: Using the Integral to Solve Problems 175
 
 
 
If you fail to notice that an integral has an undefined point 
between the limits of integration, and you integrate the ordi-
nary way, you may get the wrong answer. The above problem, 
 
, happens to work out right if you do it the ordinary 
 
way. However, if you do 
 the ordinary way, not only 
 
do you get it wrong, you get the absurd answer of negative 2, 
even though the function is positive from 
. Don’t risk it.
 
If either part of the split-up integral diverges, the original inte-
gral diverges. You can’t get, say, 
 for one part and  for the 
other part and add them up to get zero.
Improper integrals with infinite 
limits of integration
You do these improper integrals by turning them into limits 
where c approaches infinity or negative infinity. Here are two 
examples: 
 and 
.
So this improper integral converges. In the next integral, the 
denominator is smaller — x instead of 
 — and thus the 
fraction is bigger, so you’d expect 
 to be bigger than 
, which it is. But it’s not just bigger, it’s way, way 
bigger.

Calculus Essentials For Dummies 
176
This improper integral diverges.
When both of the limits of integration are infinite, you split 
the integral in two and turn each part into a limit. Splitting 
up the integral at x = 0 is convenient because zero’s an easy 
number to deal with, but you can split it up anywhere. Zero 
may also seem like a good choice because it looks like it’s in 
the middle between 
. But that’s an illusion because 
there is no middle between 
, or you could say that 
any point on the x-axis is the middle.
Here’s an example: 
 
1. Split the integral in two.
 
 
 
2. Turn each part into a limit.
 
 
 
3. Evaluate each part and add up the results.
 
 
 If either “half” integral diverges, the whole diverges.

From limits and differentiation to related rates and 
integration, this practical, friendly guide provides clear 
explanations of the core concepts you need to take your 
calculus skills to the next level. It’s perfect for cramming, 
homework help, or review.
•  Test the limits (and continuity) — get the low-
down on limits and continuity as they relate to 
critical concepts in calculus
•  Ride the slippery slope — understand how differ-
entiation works, from finding the slope of a curve 
to making the rate-slope connection  
•  Integrate yourself — discover how integration 
and area approximation are used to solve a bevy 
of calculus problems
•  Work it out — arm yourself with the problem-
solving skills you need to crack calculus code, 
from using the integral to analyzing arc length, 
and everything in between
Just the key
concepts you need
to score high in calculus
