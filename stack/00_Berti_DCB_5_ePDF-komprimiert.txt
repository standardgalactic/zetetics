A culture based upon the printed book, which has prevailed from the Renaissance
until lately, has bequeathed to us — along with its immeasurable riches –
snobberies which ought to be cast aside. We ought to take a fresh look at tradition,
considered not as the inert acceptance of a fossilized corpus of themes and
conventions, but as an organic habit of re-creating what has been received and is
handed on.

Acknowledgments
This book and the data described in it are the result of a number of years of re-
search activities, seminars, workshops, courses and summer schools, where I had
the privilege to meet many colleagues and students: I express my warmest thanks
to all of them for fruitful exchanges, discussions, and help.
My first acknowledgment goes to Gregory Crane, who has supported and
encouraged my research with his endless energy both at Tufts University and
at the University of Leipzig. Lisa Cerrato and Alison Babeu have contributed
to my work with many conversations in meetings and workshops at the Perseus
Project. Bridget Almas helped me experiment with annotating textual fragments
in Perseids at a time when web-based annotation tools for historical documents
were still missing.
My research is deeply inspired by Neel Smith and Christopher Blackwell,
with whom I have spent many hours to discuss the complexities of philological
citations. Their students at the College of the Holy Cross and at Furman Uni-

are of great inspiration for my work.
I’m very grateful to Charlotte Schubert for our discussions on Digital Clas-
sics and for her precious help in finalizing and publishing this monograph.
I also thank Stefan Schorn and Ernest Suyver for our fruitful conversations
on the complexities of representing historical fragmentary texts in the digital age.
Finally, my deep acknowledgment is to my husband Gianluca, who has been
teaching me how to program in order to study Classical sources and who has been
helping me create the projects described in this volume.

Introduction
This book is the publication of the Habilitation monograph that I wrote to describe
the results of new experimental research in Digital Classics carried out at the
University of Leipzig as part of the Open Philology project of the Alexander von
Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities.
The aim of this monograph is to present a new model for producing digi-
tal editions of historical fragmentary texts, by which I mean texts that are now
lost in their original form and transmitted only through quotations and reuses
in later works. Being a Classicist, in this research I analyze ancient Greek and
Latin sources with a main focus on historiography. The choice of this topic is due
to three main circumstances: 1) an interest in Greek fragmentary historiography
that led me to explore this genre and publish papers and critical editions of frag-
mentary authors,1 2) a related interest in the transmission of Classical texts and
in the philological contribution of the Alexandrian Library,2 and 3) the impact
of the digital revolution on Greek and Latin that brought me to work with the
Perseus Project at Tufts University and with the Open Greek and Latin initiative at
the University of Leipzig.3
The meaning of the term edition in the title of this book has to be explained,
given that this word is the focus of many scholarly debates in recent publications
concerning the Digital Humanities.4 In my work, the expression digital edition
refers not to the publication of a new reconstructed text of Greek historical frag-
ments that is the result of autopsies and new readings of manuscripts and other
historical media, but to the critical selection, production, analysis, interpretation
and annotation of digital data about fragmentary authors and works. Scholars

Introduction
with enough experience in digital data know that the computational environ-
ment is bringing new questions and solutions to the treatment and preservation
of historical texts. Centuries of philological practice have been contributing in an
impressive manner to the advancement of our knowledge of the Greco-Roman
world thanks to the technology of the printed book. If the goal of the digital turn
is to preserve these results and continue these exegetical efforts, it is indisputable
that the digital medium is very different from the printed medium and that it
requires a different approach.
This monograph describes practical and concrete problems that scholars
have to deal with when trying to digitally represent and analyze textual frag-
ments of lost authors and works. Publishing printed historical fragments is a
very difficult and complex task. Publishing digital historical fragments is an even
more difficult and complex task, because, if we always need to answer critical
research questions, we also have to navigate in a new dimension where we can’t
rely on the work of our predecessors and we can’t make use of conventions and
standards established by philology in the printed age.
This is the reason why results described in this book are experimental and
address new issues that still have to be properly discussed and solved if we want
to take full advantage of digital technologies and fulfill our responsibility to pre-
serve the Greek and Latin textual heritage. When I started my work on this topic,
the technology was different and many digital resources for analyzing Greek and
Latin were missing. A lot of time was spent on producing data and rethinking
our approach to historical sources.5 My future work and the work of future gen-
erations will certainly help go beyond naiveties and mistakes of this first phase
of research in Digital Classics.
Experiments and results of my research are also profoundly influenced by
and indebted to very different scholary environments I have been working for.
My Italian academic background taught me the principles of historiographical re-
search. My activities at the Perseus Project represented a fundamental moment to
move from analog to digital philology and concretely experiment with the pro-
duction of digital textual fragments. My research and teaching duties in the In-
stitute of Computer Science at the University of Leipzig have given me the pos-
sibility to deepen the computational aspect and produce new resources.
The outcome is a very interdisciplinary product that also reflects what is
happening not only in Classics, but also in Computational Linguistics and Digital
Humanities, where we can see the birth and growth of many projects that apply
new technologies to the study of historical languages and of the ancient world.6

Introduction
3
This monograph is structured in five chapters that introduce the new domain
of digital fragmentary literature and describe two related projects that I have been
working on in the last five years: the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
and the Digital Athenaeus.
Chapter 1 (Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture) explains the meaning of the
word fragment in Classical studies and individuates the most important scholarly
phases that have been producing modern collections of fragmentary texts. Statis-
tics are offered to quantify the amount of fragmentary authors and works on the
basis of available digital data, and a description of the characteristics of printed
editions of historical fragmentary texts is provided to show the role of the tech-
nology of the printed book in shaping the field of fragmentary historiography in
the last two centuries.
Chapter 2 (Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution) describes the first
generation of digital libraries where fragmentary texts are collected and pub-
lished in a way that still depends on the printed editorial practice. The chapter
analyzes how hypertextual theories are important for a new model of fragmen-
tary texts in a digital environment and describes the concept of cover-text, that
helps philologists move the attention from the isolated fragment to its context of
transmission. The chapter describes also experimental implementations of com-
putational techniques that in the future will be hopefully applied to the domain
of fragmentary literature, such as text reuse detection, intertextual analysis, and
translation alignment.
Chapter 3 (Distributed Annotations of Fragmentary Texts) explains the new
idea of conceiving fragmentary texts as annotations of textual elements about
lost authors and works. It also describes two resources for producing canonical
citations and annotations of historical fragments: the CITE Architecture and the
Perseids Fragmentary Texts Editor.
Chapter 4 (Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum) is the description of
the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG), which is the dynamic and
expanded version of the printed edition of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
(FHG) edited by Karl Müller.
Chapter 5 (Digital Athenaeus) is the description of the Digital Athenaeus,
which is a project that provides an inventory of authors and works cited in the
Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis and implements a data model for iden-
tifying, analyzing, and citing uniquely instances of text reuse, in order to produce
a text-based and annotated catalog of Greek fragmentary authors and works.
The Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum is not the mere digitization
of a printed collection, but the extraction, expansion, and deep analysis of its data
to produce further resources for the study of Greek fragmentary historians and
their works. The reasons for choosing this collection are fully explained in the

4
Introduction
following pages. Nevertheless and given the topic of this monograph, a reader
could ask why I didn’t produce a new born-digital edition of Greek fragmentary
historians. I have two main answers to this question.
The first answer is that many extant sources that preserve Greek historical
fragments are still missing in an open and digital format. A comparison with
the first volume of the indices of Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker by
Pierre Bonnechère shows how many sources of fragments and editions are not
yet digitized.7 This situation will be certainly overcome in the next decades, but
today is a significant limit considering that a complete collection of source texts
preserving testimonies and fragments is the preliminary condition to produce an
edition of a fragmentary author.
The second answer is that the time at my disposal for this project would have
allowed me to work only on one fragmentary author or on a small group of au-
thors with a limited number of fragments. The adverb only in this sentence may
seem provocative, because the study of a single fragmentary author can be ex-
tremely difficult and time consuming, as I know by experience. But, if we change
our perspective from a traditional philological point of view to a computational
point of view, this adverb makes better sense. Focusing on one author or on a
small group of authors would have resulted in a work very similar to what I edited
in a printed format, without a proper exploration of new computational possibil-
ities. The goal of this research was not to replicate what we can still achieve with
the technology of the printed book, but to experiment with new forms of analysis
in a digital environment, where a single fragmentary author or a few hundreds
fragments are not enough as an object of study.8
This book shows that digital libraries are transforming the concept of tex-
tual fragments. If in printed books textual fragments are chunks of texts extracted
from their original context, in digital editions they are annotations of textual el-
ements pertaining to lost authors and works. The Digital Athenaeus project was
born from the need to produce this model and move from the perspective of the
quoted author to that of the quoting author, which will be the prevailing per-
spective in the future development of digital fragmentary literature. The choice
of the Deipnosophists is not only due to historical and philological reasons that
are extensively described in the following pages, but also to the fact that its main
editions are openly available in a digital format and that data can be extracted
and structured from them in a sustainable way.
This monograph is written in English for two main reasons. The first rea-
son is that English is not only the language of the Digital Humanities, but also

the natural language that in the last decades has produced models and program-
ming languages to analyze textual data. If our responsibility as humanists and
philologists is to translate and express these models into other languages, we
can’t renounce to describe the results of our research in English, given that this
language permeates methods and standards of Digital Philology.
The second reason is that I was employed as an Academic Assistant of the
Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig
to develop an English program for teaching and research. I achieved this task by
contributing to the creation of a new Bachelor of Science and a new Master of
Science in Digital Humanities, where I currently teach courses in Digital Philol-
ogy and Digital Classics.9 I also fulfilled this task by promoting research projects,
conferences, and publications that include data described in this book.10

Part of this task was also the creation of Sunoikisis Digital Classics, which is an interna-
tional consortium of Digital Classics programs developed in collaboration with the Har-
vard’s Center for Hellenic Studies and the Institute of Classical Studies at the University
of London: Berti/Crane et al. (2015); Berti (2016b); Berti (2017c); Berti (2017b).

Bibliographic resources are collected in the Bibliography at the end of the volume with
DOIs and dates of access. The volume cites many links that are not provided with stable
identifiers, but are important to show the current state of research. The last access to these
links was on July 23, 2021. The Index at the end of the volume lists Digital Humanities and
Digital Classics projects not explicitly mentioned in chapter and section titles.


1 Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture
This chapter explains the meaning and the development of the word frag-
ment when referred to the domain of literary texts and print culture. The
first section (1.1) distinguishes between material fragments of ancient ev-
idence and textual fragments represented by quotations and text reuses.
The second section (1.2) traces the relationship between Classical schol-
arship and textual fragments by individuating the most important phases
that have been producing modern collections of fragmentary authors and
works. The third section (1.3) offers statistics for quantifying the amount
of fragmentary authors and works based on data available in contemporary
digital libraries. The fourth section (1.4) analyzes characteristics of printed
editions of historical fragmentary texts in order to understand the role of
the technology of printed books in determining the birth and the growth of
fragmentary historiography in the last two centuries.
1.1 Fragments and Fragmentary Texts
The English term fragment comes from the Latin word fragmentum and from
the verb frangere, which means to break. The Oxford English Dictionary defines
fragment (s.v.) as “a part broken off or otherwise detached from a whole; a broken
piece; a (comparatively) small detached portion of anything.” The word can also
be used figuratively as “a detached, isolated, or incomplete part; a (comparatively)
small portion of anything; a part remaining or still preserved when the whole is
lost or destroyed.” As far as artistic or literary works are concerned, the word
refers to “an extant portion of a writing or composition which as a whole is lost;
also, a portion of a work left uncompleted by its author; hence, a part of any
unfinished whole or uncompleted design.”
These definitions show that the inner characteristic of a fragment is its being
the surviving piece of something irremediably lost or never finished. In this sense
the word is applied to a great variety of physical remains of ancient evidence, such
as monumental ruins, potsherds, scraps of papyri and broken inscriptions. The
boundaries of these fragments are marked by margins, whose materiality draws
our attention to the exteriority of the evidence, influencing our reconstruction of
7

1 Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture
the wholeness to which the fragment belonged and our perception of the reasons
of its fragmentation, usually due to an external violent event like destruction or
consumption.1
Most of what we still have from the ancient world has been preserved in a
fragmented form and physical fragments include many typologies ranging from
big architectural elements to small sherds. When physical fragments bear textual
evidence the materiality of the fragment extends also to the text, which becomes
the surviving broken off piece of an ancient writing. Epigraphy and papyrology
are the disciplines devoted to collecting, restoring, studying and integrating texts
that have been engraved, painted, or written on any materials surviving from the
past. Fragmentary texts of this kind include many different types of documents
that pertain to public, private, documentary and literary spheres. Examples are
fragments of decrees, laws, ostraka, gravestones, inscribed vases, brick stamps,
loom weights, letters, private contracts, legal documents, accounts and literary
texts.2 An interesting group of this evidence is constituted by literary works
preserved only on physical fragments. Given that this book is mainly focused
on Greek historical and historiographical texts, two significant examples are the
Hellenica Oxyrhynchia and the Marmor Parium.
The Hellenica Oxyrhynchia is a 4th century BC work of history transmitted
on papyrus fragments of the 1st and 2nd century CE stored in different collec-
tions in Egypt, Great Britain, Italy and the United States of America.3 In this case
we have a fragmentary work in the literal sense of the word, because the historio-
graphical research of the author of the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia — whose identity is
still questioned — has been preserved only thanks to these fragments of papyrus.
The Marmor Parium is a Hellenistic chronicle on a marble slab coming from
the Greek island of Paros. The document contains a Greek chronology (1581/80–
299/98 BC) with a list of kings and archons accompanied by short references to
historical events mainly based on the Athenian history. The text is dated to the
3rd century BC and part of it survives in two fragments (A and B) preserved in
the Ashmolean Museum of the University of Oxford and in the Archaeological

P.Oxy V 842; PSI XIII 1304; P.Cair. temp. inv. no. 26/6/27/1–35. Editions of the work have
been published by Kalinka (1927), Bartoletti (1959), and Chambers (1993). Open to debate is
the belonging of P.Mich. 5982, 5796b, and other papyri to the same work: see Pesely (1994)
and Mariotta (2013). For a recent historiographical study of the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, see

Museum of Paros.4 As for the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, also the Marmor Parium
is a fragmentary work produced by an unknown author whose historiographical
text is still extant only through these fragments of marble. Another example is a
group of texts that the online Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) labels as Anonymi
Historici (tlg1139). This collection includes forty historical fragmentary texts pre-
served on inscriptions, papyri, manuscripts and quotations in later texts.5
Even if technically it is not a fragmentary text, I can also mention the Consti-
tution of the Athenians attributed to Aristotle. The Aristotelian work was known
only thanks to quotations and text reuses until the discovery in Egypt in the 19th
century of papyri bearing the text, which are now preserved in the Staatliche
Museen zu Berlin and in the British Library in London.6 The text is for the most
part complete and is a very important example of a literary work transmitted only
on papyrus and not through manuscript tradition in the Middle Ages.7
Scholarship employs the expressions fragment and fragmentary text to refer
also to another kind of evidence, which is constituted by incomplete textual quo-
tations and reuses. This category includes many different examples that range
from verbatim quotations to paraphrases and allusions.8 Fragmentary texts of
this type can be divided into two main groups:
1. Fragmentary texts of still extant works. This form of reuse is attested when
an ancient author quotes, paraphrases, or alludes to another author whose text
has been preserved by the tradition. In this case the reuse can be compared with
the original text in order to check the reliability of the quotation.

IG XII 5, 444. The upper part of fragment A is lost and known only from the transcription
produced by John Selden in the 17th century. Standard editions of the Marmor Parium are
still those published by Jacoby (1904) and in FGrHist 239. Cf. also BNJ 239. The Greek text
of the stone with Latin translation, chronological table, and commentary was published
by Karl Müller in FHG I, whose digital version is now available as part of the Digital Frag-
menta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) project, which is also producing an experimental
digital edition of the Marmor Parium: see section 4.5. For a recent study of the literary and
historiographical characteristics of the chronicle, see Rotstein (2016).

1 Fragmentary Texts and Print Culture
Examples are citations of Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides or Xenophon in the
Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis.9 Here is an example for Herodotus:
Deipn. 12.58 = 541bc: περὶδὲΣμινδυρίδου τοῦΣυβαρίτου καὶτῆς
τούτου τρυφῆς ἱστόρησεν Ἡρόδοτος ἐν τῇἕκτῃ, ὡς ἀποπλέων ἐπὶ
τὴν μνηστείαν τῆς Κλεισθένους τοῦΣικυωνίων τυράννου θυγατρὸς
Ἀγαρίστης, φησίν, ἀπὸμὲν Ἰταλίης Σμινδυρίδης ὁἹπποκράτεος
Συβαρίτης, ὃς ἐπὶπλεῖστον δὴχλιδῆς εἷς ἀνὴρ ἀφίκετο. εἵποντο
γοῦν αὐτῷχίλιοι μάγειροι καὶὀρνιθευταί. ἱστορεῖπερὶαὐτοῦκαὶ
Τίμαιος ἐν τῇἑβδόμῃ.10
Hdt. 6.127.1: ἀπὸμὲν δὴἸταλίης ἦλθε Σμινδυρίδης ὁἹπποκράτεος
Συβαρίτης, ὃς ἐπὶπλεῖστον δὴχλιδῆς εἷς ἀνὴρ ἀπίκετο (ἡδὲΣύβαρις
ἤκμαζε τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον μάλιστα), καὶΣιρίτης Δάμασος Ἀμύριος
τοῦσοφοῦλεγομένου παῖς.11
Athenaeus quotes almost verbatim the words of Herodotus, but the context is
different because he is talking about people who are famous for their love for
luxury (τρυφή), while the Halicarnassensis is mentioning Smindyrides in a pas-
sage concerning the family of the Alcmeonidae and he uses only the term χλιδή
(extravagance), which is different from τρυφή (luxury). If the work of Herodotus
was lost, we could read his words through Athenaeus, but we would attribute to
him also the information about the number of cooks and fowlers accompaning
the Sybarite, which doesn’t appear in his text and probably comes from the lost
historian Timaeus who is cited at the end of the passage.12
Another example is a reference to the History of the Peloponnesian War of
Thucydides in the text of the Deipnosophists:

Ambaglio (1990); Bouvier (2007); Bréchet (2007); Lenfant (2007c); Maisonneuve (2007); Ol-
son (2018). On quotations of Homer in the text of the Deipnosophists and how to represent
them in a digital environment, see Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016).
10
“Herodotus in Book VI told the story of Smindyrides of Sybaris and his addiction to luxury,
describing how he sailed off to court Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes, the tyrant of
Sicyon: From Italy, he says, came Smindyrides the son of Hippocrates of Sybaris, who was
more devoted to luxury than any of the others. He was accompanied, for example, by 1000
cooks and fowlers. Timaeus also discusses him in Book VII.” Trans. by Olson (2006–2012).
The same story is also narrated in Athen., Deipn. 6.105 (= 273bc).
11
“From Italy came Smindyrides of Sybaris, son of Hippocrates, the most luxurious liver of
his day (and Sybaris was then at the height of its prosperity), and Damasus of Siris, son of
that Amyris who was called The Wise.” Trans. by Godley (1920–1925).

1.1 Fragments and Fragmentary Texts
11
Deipn. 5.15 = 189c: λέγονται δὲἈθήνησι καὶἱεροί τινες αὐλῶνες, ὧν
μέμνηται Φιλόχορος ἐν τῇἐνάτῃ. καλοῦσι δ᾽ἀρσενικῶς τοὺς αὐλῶ-
νας, ὥσπερ Θουκυδίδης ἐν τῇδʹ καὶπάντες οἱκαταλογάδην συγ-
γραφεῖς, οἱδὲποιηταὶθηλυκῶς.13
Thuc. 4.103.1: ἐπὶταύτην οὖν ὁΒρασίδας ἄρας ἐξ Ἀρνῶν τῆς Χαλ-
κιδικῆς ἐπορεύετο τῷστρατῷ. καὶἀφικόμενος περὶδείλην ἐπὶτὸν
Αὐλῶνα καὶΒορμίσκον, ᾗἡΒόλβη λίμνη ἐξίησιν ἐς θάλασσαν, καὶ
δειπνοποιησάμενος ἐχώρει τὴν νύκτα.14
The two contexts are completely different because Athenaeus is discussing the
meaning of the words αὐλή (court), αὐλός (pipe), αὐλῶπις (helmet with a tube-
like opening) and αὐλών (hollow), while Thucydides is talking about the march of
the Spartan general Brasidas against Amphipolis and he mentions the toponym
Aulon (Αὐλών) in Chalcidice. If we didn’t have the text of Thucydides, it would be
impossible to infer the context of his passage, as for the lost text of Philochorus
who is mentioned in the same context.15 Moreover, Athenaeus is not precise
because Thucydides doesn’t refer to the noun but to the geographical place, and
the Naucratites was probably getting the citation of the passage of the historian
from an intermediate source.16
2. Fragmentary texts of lost works. This kind of reuse, which is the most
interesting and challenging one, is represented by authors who quote, cite, or
paraphrase other authors whose texts are currently lost. In this case the reuse
can’t be compared with the original text and its interpretation depends on many
factors. An example is a passage of the Lexicon of the Ten Orators of Harpocration
concerning the Athenian festival of the Panathenaea:17
Lex., s.v. Παναθήναια: Δημοσθένης Φιλιππικοῖς. διττὰΠαναθήναια
ἤγετο Ἀθήνησι, τὰμὲν καθ᾽ἕκαστον ἐνιαυτόν, τὰδὲδιὰπενταε-
13
“Certain sacred aulones (hollows) in Athens are referred to; Philochorus mentions them in
Book IX. Some authorities have the word in the masculine, as for example Thucydides in
Book IV and all prose-authors, whereas the poets have it in the feminine.” Trans. by Olson
(2006–2012).
14
“Against this place Brasidas marched with his army, setting out from Arnae in Chalcidice.
Arriving about dusk at Aulon and Bormiscus, where the lake Bolbe has its outlet into the
sea, he took supper and then proceeded by night.” Trans. by Smith (1928–1935).

little before the Great Panathenaia.’ The festival was first celebrated by Erikhthonios, son
of Hephaistos, as both Hellanikos and Androtion record, each one in the first (book) of
Atthis. Before this (the festival) was called Athenaia, as is made clear by Istros in the third
(book) of his Attika.” Trans. by Harding (2008) 39.

“μικρὸν δὲπρὸτῶν μεγάλων Παναθηναίων.” ἤγαγε δὲτὴν ἑορ-

In this entry Harpocration cites five authors, of whom two are still extant (De-
mosthenes and Isocrates) and three are lost (Hellanicus, Androtion, and Istros).
Demosthenes and Isocrates are cited as examples of the use of the expressions
Παναθήναια (Panathenaea) and μεγάλα Παναθήναια (great Panathenaea), but
their contexts don’t contain a description of the two festivals.18 As far as the
three Atthidographers are concerned and except for the few references of Har-
pocration, it is not possible to reconstruct the context of their texts and in fact
their contribution to the history of the festival of the Panathenaea is discussed by
scholars.19
All these examples show that the term fragment can be quite misleading
when referred to a reused text. In most cases a fragment is not the broken off
piece of a lost original text, but the result of the philological and historiographical
interpretation of the scholar who has to dig into the context in order to measure
the distance between the lost text and its reuse.20 This is one of the reasons why
in recent scholarship the focus has moved from the fragment to the preserving
context, and in the digital environment the expression text reuse is preferred to
fragmentary text.21
Classical scholarship makes also use of other terms to refer to other texts
transmitted in the form of quotations and reuses, such as, for example, epitoma,
excerptum, frustulum and reliquia.22 As far as epitomes are concerned, there are
many different examples among which I can remember the abridged versions
of the works of Livy (including the Periochae), the epitome of the Aristotelian
Politeiai by Heraclides Lembus, Iustinus’ epitome of Pompeius Trogus’ Historiae

physical objects, never to portions of discourse […] This metaphor seems not to have been
invented until relatively modern times […] small parts of a larger text are not fragments
but just quotations or excerpts.”

It is not always possible to distinguish between fragmenta and these forms of text reuses,
because many times there is an inevitable overlapping, but in any case this terminology
gives a sense of the vast variety of reuses of texts of Classical works: see Most (1997).

epitomes of the Aegyptiaca by Manetho.23 An important example of excerpts is
represented by the Excerpta Constantiniana that was produced in Constantinople
in the 10th century under the supervision of the emperor Constantinus Porphy-
rogenitus, who gathered a group of excerptores to extract and combine excerpts
about 53 topics from Classical and Byzantine historiographical works.24 Another
example is represented by the excerpts of ancient Greek geographers collected by
Karl Müller in the 19th century.25 The terms frustula and reliquiae are used, for
example, to refer to groups of anonymous poetic fragments and in the collection
of the fragments of the Roman historians by Hermann Peter.26
1.2 Classical Scholarship and Textual Fragments
Collecting fragments is not a recent activity, but dates back to ancient times when
authors excerpted passages of texts in order to assemble and transmit them for
many different purposes. Philologists, grammarians, and lexicographers pro-
duced collections of notes, extracts, quotations and references to other texts in
order to create bibliographies and research tools about a wide range of topics.
Alexandrian scholarship has a crucial role in this long and complex process that
has indirectly transmitted Classical works, and the tradition also preserves traces
of the methods used by authors like Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Aulus Gellius and
Athenaeus in their intellectual activities.27
Given that for a long period of time in antiquity texts were for the most part
still availabe, in this case collecting fragments didn’t originate from the need of
looking for lost works, but from the necessity of producing reference tools that
could facilitate information management and accessibility.28 From the Renais-
sance onwards, when humanists realized that recently discovered manuscripts
didn’t preserve the entirety of Classical textuality, collecting fragments became

a way for publishing the most celebrated authors and, after that, for gathering
traces of an irremediably lost past.29
Glenn Most individuates two phases in the history of postclassical scholar-
ship on collecting fragments. The first is the “humanist and early modern” phase
that began in the second half of the 16th century and was “largely aesthetic in
orientation,” because the interest was more in publishing the very best fragments
of the most important authors than in producing complete, critical, and exhaus-
tive collections.30 The second is the “romantic and contemporary” phase that
began in the second half of the 18th century and was characterised by a “refor-
mulated scholarship,” which brought a new attempt to understand the totality
of the past beyond the few surviving canonical works and “a new dignity to the
fragment.” These elements were fundamental for developing a new scholarship
on ancient literary fragments that took off in the middle and the second half of
the 19th century, when “systematic coherence and philological rigor” produced
big collections of fragmentary texts belonging to many different genres, as for
example epic poetry, comedy, tragedy, philosophy and historiography.31 This
second phase lies at the bottom of contemporary scholarship on fragmentary au-
thors, which still relies on four “basic methodological pillars”: 1) the efforts of
identifying and attributing (a) single lost works to individual authors, (b) single
fragments to individual authors and works, and (c) single fragments to literary
genres but not to a particular author or work; 2) the complete and exhaustive ex-
amination of all the sources that make possible the identification of fragments; 3)
the distinction between the original words of a lost text and the context in which
the reference to them is preserved; 4) a systematic source criticism in order to in-
vestigate and understand, as far as possible, the relationship among the sources
of fragments.32
A complete and detailed list of collections of fragmentary authors and works
produced between the 19th and the 21st century is beyond the scope of this book,
but I can cite the most important editions:

works remains widely if unobtrusively operative,” see Dionisotti (1997) 8, who explores
many different forms of fragmenta in Classical scholarship.

ing authors originally published in the FGrHist of Felix Jacoby, and the project

New technologies applied to philology are posing new questions and chal-
lenges about representing fragmentary texts in a digital environment. The goal
of this book is to discuss these questions and offer solutions by describing the
impact of the digital revolution on literary sources and by presenting the Digital
Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) and the Digital Athenaeus projects
(see chapters 2–5). I begin by showing preliminary statistics of the amount of
fragmentary authors and works at our disposal and by examining characteristics
of printed editions of fragmentary texts.
1.3 How Many Fragmentary Texts?
In an important paper significantly entitled Umblick im Trümmerfeld der griechis-
chen Geschichtsschreibung, Hermann Strasburger tried to quantify the “land of
ruins” of ancient Greek historiograhy and came to the conclusion that the tradi-
tion has preserved only about 2.5% of what was originally written, with a ratio of
1 to 40 between what is still extant and what is lost.41
Given the fragmentary state of ancient evidence and its complexity, count-
ing the amount of textual fragments and calculate its proportion in relation to
what has survived from the past are a difficult task that can’t produce complete
and definitive results, first of all because it’s not possible to establish with preci-
sion what is a fragmentary text.42 Nevertheless, undertaking this task is impor-
tant from a methodological and a numerical point of view: From a methodolog-
ical point of view, because a survey of fragmentary texts helps scholars identify
and overview different kinds of textual fragments and their characteristics across
the centuries and in different literary cultures; from a numerical point of view,
because this effort gives the opportunity to quantify — at least partially and in
a relative way — the amount of evidence that we have at our disposal and the
kind of work necessary to produce new editions of fragmentary authors and new
collections of fragmentary works.

1.3 How Many Fragmentary Texts?
17
In a digital environment this kind of task is even more relevant because it
allows research investigators to calculate the amount of data to be digitized, pro-
cessed, produced, critically edited and stored. These statistics become important
in order to plan digital projects that involve a certain number of people with dif-
ferent expertise, that might require a long period of time to be accomplished, and
that consequently request an estimate of project costs.
Hermann Strasburger based his statistics on the number of pages of the edi-
tiones minores of the Bibliotheca Teubneriana and on the number of books of frag-
mentary works and of pages of modern collections of fragmentary historians.43
The interest in counting books and the extent of library collections is evidenced
since ancient times. Callimachus of Cyrene in his Tables (Pinakes) of ancient lit-
erature classified authors by genre and, as far as we know, probably included also
information about the number of books and lines of every work.44 Ancient au-
thors tried also to quantify the amount of texts stored in the Library of Alexandria
and modern scholars have made an effort to check the reliability of these numbers
and produce new figures.45 All these methods depend on the kind of medium by
which works are transmitted, like papyri, manuscripts, printed books, and now
digital data.46 Moreover, we also have to take into account the nature and ar-
rangement of libraries and catalogs.
Digital technologies and the World Wide Web have been creating many dif-
ferent resources that range from huge collections (like Internet Archive, Google
Books, and HathiTrust) to digital library catalogs and repositories belonging to
specific domains of Classical literature. Most of these projects are collecting data
created for printed publications and are generating other data that is the result
of a digitization workflow of printed editions. In order to quantify what is now
available and what has to be done in the next decades, we can explore these dig-
ital collections to see how they reflect the “land of ruins” described by Hermann
Strasburger in his paper.
As far as ancient Greek fragmentary historians and works are concerned, I
provide here a first set of data and statistics drawn from different digital projects
pertaining to ancient Greek literature: the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG), the
Perseus Catalog, the Open Greek and Latin (OGL), the First One-Thousand Years of
Greek (First1KGreek), the Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ), and the Digital Fragmenta His-

fragments of it has been preserved. For the nature of this collection see, among many
others, Parsons (1952) 204–218, Witty (1958), and Blum (1991). Traces of ancient criteria
for calculating the extent of works can be also found in later authors as Athenaeus of
Naucratis and in encyclopedic works like the Suda: see, for example, Jacob (2001) lxiv ff.,
Jacob (2004), and Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016) 123.

toricorum Graecorum (DFHG). These resources are ongoing projects and therefore
I can only offer provisional statistics, which are in any case important to under-
stand the state of the art at the beginning of the 21st century, not only in terms
of numbers but also in terms of characteristics, limits, and omissions of these
collections.47
Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG). The TLG (subscription required) is the old-
est and biggest digital library of ancient Greek texts.48 The project started in 1972
at the University of California, Irvine, with the goal of creating a digital library of
Greek literaty texts from Homer (8th century BC) to 600 CE.49 The collection was
later expanded to include Byzantine works until 1453 CE and a large number of
texts up to the 20th century.50 Today the online version contains more than 110
million words from over 10,000 works associated with 4,000 authors. The TLG
Statistics page (subscription required) shows that the TLG collects 3,293 authors
for the period of time between the 8th century BC and the 20th century CE, in-
cluding authors dated as varia and incerta. Limiting the selection to the centuries
8th BC through 6th CE, the TLG has 2,120 authors + 99 varia and 90 incerta for a
total of 2,309 authors (fig. 1.1).

1.3 How Many Fragmentary Texts?
19
Since the beginning, the TLG has addressed the problem of including lost
authors. According to the Canon, the TLG lists authors “represented by some
form of text that owes its provenance to codices, papyri, inscriptions, or quota-
tions by later authors. There are, however, some authors who are lost except for
the testimonia provided by later authors. […] Some of these lost writers have,
in fact, been assigned a place in the Canon, although there has not been a con-
sistent effort to include every lost author mentioned in the surviving testimonia.
[…] Entirely omitted from the Canon, however, are authors who are known to us
only by way of anecdote or through recollected or (ostensibly) reported conver-
sation. Such authors remain lost, and it is the anecdotist whose text resides in the
data bank.”51 Luci Berkowitz and Karl Squitier clarify that the criterion for includ-
ing lost authors in the TLG Canon depends on printed collections of fragments,
where fragmentary authors may be represented by quotations (fragmenta), by ref-
erences to their literary production and activity (testimonia), or only by titles.52 In
the CD-ROMs of the TLG, work titles were accompanied by codes identifying the
means of transmission of texts, and the codes Q and NQ were used for quotation and
no quotation: They stood for direct and indirect quotations, and for testimonia
and titles.53 This criterion is still reflected in the online version of the TLG, where
there are no more codes for indicating the means of transmission of texts, but the
field Work Title includes the forms fragmentum, testimonium, and titulus.54 Ex-
amples are the Fragmenta of the comic author Aristophanes (tlg0019.012–018),
the Testimonia of the historian Acusilaus (tlg0392.001 and 003), and the Tituli of
the comic author Alexis (tlg0402.004).55
Considering this arrangement of texts and editions, it is possible to search
the online version of the TLG with the string fragm* in the TLG field All Fields
(which includes Author, Editor, Work Title, Publ. Title, Series and Publ. Year).

54
On the TLG work title Fragmentum or Fragmenta, see Berkowitz/Squitier (1990) xxiii.
The online version of the TLG has work classification tags, which include also the forms
fragm. and test. As for now, fragm. is used only for the fragments of Joannes Doceianus
(tlg3288.006), while test. is used for the Testimonia published in 147 editions of different
authors. On work classification tags and on the label Test. in the TLG Canon, see Berkow-
itz/Squitier (1990) xxviii and xlviii.
55
TLG authors have four-digit numbers, while TLG works have three-digit numbers. In the
examples mentioned in the text, multiple works correspond to multiple editions. Frag-
menta of Aristophanes are from seven editions and the Testimonia of Acusilaus from two
editions. In the past, TLG fragmentary works (i.e., works not to be found in an indepen-
dent text edition) had numbers with an x replacing the first of the three digits in the work
number (e.g., the fragments of Erasistratus quoted by Galen: tlg0690.x01): see Berkowitz/
Squitier (1990) xxii.

1.3 How Many Fragmentary Texts?
21
The search is not limited to the fields Author and Work Title because there are
TLG fragmentary works without a fragmentary specification (e.g., the work title
Κωμῳδούμενοι of a fragmentary comedy of the Comica Adespota: tlg0662.008).
On the other hand, it is also necessary to eliminate works that are included in the
results because the corresponding Publ. title has a form of the word fragmentum
(e.g., Lysias’ extant orations that are part of Christopher Carey’s edition entitled
Lysiae orationes cum fragmentis). For the period between the 8th century BC and
the 6th century CE, the TLG counts 1,131 fragmentary authors + 29 varia and
50 incerta, for a total of 1,210 fragmentary authors (fig. 1.2). Within this group,
there are 215 authors with both extant and fragmentary works, and 995 authors
with only fragmentary works (fig. 1.3). Examples are authors like Sophocles, for
whom we have both extant tragedies and fragmentary ones, and Hellanicus, who
is known only through references and quotations in later texts.56

Table 1.1 shows that for the period between the 8th century BC and the 6th cen-
tury CE (including varia and incerta) the TLG collects 1,210 fragmentary authors
and 2,314 fragmentary work titles whose texts have been digitized from 489 edi-
tions. The TLG field Series includes only the entry Poetarum Graecorum Frag-
menta. A deeper analysis reveals that there are other terms in the TLG field Work
Title used for fragmentary works: fragmentum, frustulum, epitome, excerptum,
testimonium and titulus with inflected forms. Table 1.2 shows the number of oc-
currences of these terms based on data filtered with the string fragm* in the TLG
field All Fields and for the period of time between the 8th century BC and the 6th
century CE (including varia and incerta).

TLG fragmentary works are classified according to 69 work classifications grouped
in 236 combinations:59
Alchemica, Apocalypsis, Apocrypha, Apologetica, Astrologica, Astronomica, Biographa, Bucolica,
Catena, Chronographa, Comica, Commentarius, Coquinaria, Dialogus, Doxographa, Ecclesiastica,

Given that the TLG is an ongoing project and new authors, works, and editions
are periodically added, this data is partly provisional, even if it mostly covers the
current state of textual transmission. Moreover, literary and geographical clas-
sifications of authors and works are always problematic. Nevertheless, the goal
of these statistics and numbers is to collect a first set of information concerning
what is available online in a digital format and the kind of challenges and issues
we have to deal with for new textual entries.
If we focus on historical fragmentary texts, which are the research question
of this book, the TLG includes 273 fragmentary historians (based on the TLG
author epithet Hist.) for the centuries 8 BC through 6 CE including varia and
incerta. Moreover, if we take into account the TLG combination of the epithet
Hist. with other epithets, there are 297 fragmentary historians (fig. 1.4):60
Abydenus (0116) Hist., Acesander (1832) Hist., Acusilaus (0392) Hist., Aelius Dius (2434) Hist.,

Perseus Catalog. The Perseus Digital Library and the Scaife Viewer (open access)
have no texts of fragmentary authors, but the Perseus Catalog collects informa-
tion about editions of fragmentary authors and works. The Perseus Catalog was
conceived in 2005 with the goal of collecting open bibliographic data and meta-
data about authors, works, and editions of Greek and Latin literature. Inspired by
the FRBR model (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records), the Perseus
Catalog aims at offering a complete view of the editorial and textual tradition of
every work of Classical literature producing linked data and using standards for
connecting its resources to bigger library systems and international data banks,
as for example WorldCat and the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF).61 The
Perseus Catalog includes not only ancient Greek and Latin works, but also Arabic
works, and it is browsable by Author, Work Title, Work Original Language, Edition
or Translation Year Published, Edition or Translation Language, Series and Subjects.
The catalog counts 2,072 authors and 4,584 work titles (table 1.3). The catalog
offers also numbers for works in the original language, series, and subjects (table
1.4).

Within the collection of the Perseus Catalog, there are 891 fragmentary authors,

tary works, and 141 subjects pertaining to fragmentary works (table 1.5, figures

As far as identifiers of Greek authors and works are concerned, the Perseus Cat-
alog has been making use of the codes of the last printed edition of the TLG
Canon by Berkowitz/Squitier (1990). Perseus Catalog entries have a main CITE
URN identifier for authors and TLG identifiers for authors and works that are
also part of Perseus CTS URNs for identifying works and editions.63 As for frag-
mentary authors, an example is Hellanicus of Lesbos, who is identified with
urn:cite:perseus:author.701 and with tlg0539. Hellanicus’ Fragmenta are cata-
loged with urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0539.tlg001.64
Given that both the online TLG and the Perseus Catalog are ongoing projects,
there are cases where authors are not any more in the online TLG (but were
62
Different figures of works and work titles depend on Perseus Catalog MODS records that
include both uniform official work titles and a list of alternative titles or translated titles
found within a record. An example is represented by the fragments of Istros the Calli-
machean (urn:cite:perseus:author.776), where the table of contents of the MODS file
includes the titles Atthis, Fragmenta incertae sedis, Apollinis apparitiones, Ptolemais, Ae-
gyptiorum coloniae, Argolica, Eliaca, Collectio sacrificorum creticorum, De proprietate cer-
taminum, Melopoei, Commentarii, Dictiones atticae and Incertorum operum fragmenta from
the section of the author’s fragments in the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG):

See http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cite:perseus:author.701 and http://catalog.
perseus.org/catalog/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0539.tlg001. The further specification opp–grc1
in the Perseus Catalog identifies the fragments of Hellanicus in the edition of the FHG. In
the TLG Canon, the codes 001, 002, and 003 identify the testimonia and the fragmenta of
Hellanicus in the FGrHist and in Mette (1978) 11–12.

present in the printed edition of the Canon and therefore are still in the Perseus
Catalog) and other cases where authors collected in the Perseus Catalog are not
existing in the online TLG.
An example of the first case is Amphion of Thespiae, who is a Greek frag-
mentary historian published in the FHG (IV 301) and in the FGrHist (387 = BNJ
387). This author was originally available in the printed edition of the TLG Canon
with the number tlg2271 and the letter Q as a mean of transmission, but is not
present in the online TLG.65 The Perseus Catalog preserves his TLG record.66
As far as the second case is concerned, an example is Nicander of Alexandria,
who was published in the FHG (IV 462) and in the FGrHist (1112). The author
has been never published in the TLG and is therefore included as fhg0480 in the
Perseus Catalog.67
Another interesting example is represented by the historian Acestodorus
of Megalopolis, who was originally inserted in the printed edition of the TLG
Canon as tlg1818. The author is mentioned in a scholion to Sophocles’ Oedi-
pus Coloneus that preserves also two fragments of Istros the Callimachean and
Andron of Halicarnassus.68 The printed edition of the TLG Canon gives this in-
formation and in fact identifies Acestodorus’ fragment as tlg1818.x01 adding a

Open Greek and Latin (OGL). The Open Greek and Latin (OGL) (open access) is a
project developed at the University of Leipzig for digitizing editions of Greek and
Latin sources produced in antiquity through the 6th century CE. The goal is to
generate OCR outputs that are encoded according to the TEI XML Guidelines and
are freely downloadable and reusable. OGL has been digitizing also fragmentary
authors and is making available a first limited set of editions of fragmentary works
through a GitHub repository (fragm–dev): https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLat
in/fragmentary-dev.
First One-Thousand Years of Greek (First1KGreek). The First One-Thousand
Years of Greek (First1KGreek) (open access) is a project maintained by the Open

Harvard Library, Mount Alison University, Tufts University, the University of
Leipzig and the University of Virginia.71 The goal of this project is to collect at
least one edition of every Greek work composed between Homer and 250 CE

Jacoby Online. Jacoby Online (JO) (subscription required) is a project devel-
oped by Brill publishers to produce a digital version of Die Fragmente der griechis-

FGrHist through the Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ).72
Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG). The DFHG (open ac-
cess) provides the digital edition of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG)
by Karl Müller (see chapter 4). It collects 636 Greek fragmentary historians, who
are searchable through the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog (see section 4.4.1).
The FHG doesn’t provide dates for each author, but arranges the content in 15 sec-
tions within 5 volumes according to general chronological classifications (figg. 1.8
and 1.9).

strategies for publishing printed critical editions of Greek and Latin sources. A
walk through the shelfs of a specialized library and an online search in Google
Books show how many different examples of printed editions of primary sources
of Classical antiquity have been produced in the last five centuries. Since the
experiments of Aldus Manutius in Venice up to very recent products of publishing
companies, the technology of the printed book has played a fundamental role in
producing and shaping forms of critical collections, arrangements, and editions
of information and knowledge about historical texts.73
The digital revolution has been affecting textuality in a dramatic way and
also Classical philologists are now faced with new questions about representing
their data in a digital environment.74 In this regard digital philology has two main
goals: 1) preserve the editorial heritage of the past by digitizing printed editions
and generating machine readable and structured outputs, and 2) produce a new
digital scholarly model for editing primary sources and publishing new born-
digital editions. In this scenario, digital philologists have the responsibility of
preserving the understanding of traditional print conventions and criteria in or-
der to transfer this editorial heritage to a computational format.75 At the sime
time and while never abandoning the rigor of well established methods, the re-
sponsibility of digital philologists is to become independent of the print model in
order to create a new digital scholarly environment and avoid the risk of produc-
ing digital replica of printed editions.
This is also valid for editions of fragmentary authors and works, and this
is the aim of the two projects that will be described in chapters 4 and 5. In the
following pages I present an overview of printed editions of ancient Greek frag-
mentary historians, focusing on the two big collections edited by Karl Müller and
Felix Jacoby (including its continuatio) and on the volumes of the Italian series I
Frammenti degli Storici Greci.76
The five volumes of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG) were
edited by Karl Müller with the help of Theodor Müller and Victor Langlois, and
printed in Paris between 1841 and 1873 by the publisher Ambroise Firmin-Didot.77
The FHG is a collection of excerpts from many different sources preserving infor-
mation and text reuses about 636 ancient Greek fragmentary historians. Exclud-
ing the first volume, authors are chronologically distributed and cover a period

1.4 Fragmentary Texts and Printed Editions

of time from the 6th century BC through the 7th century CE.78 In FHG I, critical
commentaries about the life and the intellectual activity of authors (testimonia)
are published at the beginning of the volume in a section entitled De vita et scrip-
tis auctorum. From FHG II onwards, introductory commentaries are printed at
the beginning of the section of each author or group of authors.79 There are also
authors without an introduction but only with a collection of fragmenta, and au-
thors who have only an introduction discussing testimonia about them and not a
collection of fragmenta.80
Müller doesn’t provide a formal distinction between testimonia and frag-
menta like Jacoby in the FGrHist — where the letters T and F clearly separate
the two kinds of sources — but inserts testimonia into the introductions to au-
thors, and only the fragmenta represent a seperate section with a numerical ar-
rangement.81 There are also cases where Müller summarizes the content of the
fragments in a section called Argumentum.82 Under each FHG author section,
fragments are arranged by fragmentary works and in a sequence that depends on
historiographical and philological decisions of the editor.83 Figure 1.10 shows the
first page of the section about Hecataeus of Miletus with numbered fragments.84
After the Greek title of a fragmentary work (e.g., Περίοδος γῆς) and a possible
work section (e.g., Α. Εὐρώπη), there is the number of the fragment (e.g., 1), a
reference to the witness of the fragment (e.g., Herodot. IV, 36), the text of the
fragment itself extracted from the source text of the witness, and sometimes also
78
For a detailed description of the content of this edition, see section 4.1.
79
Examples of groups of authors are Dionysodorus Boeotus and Anaxis Boeotus (FHG II 84),
who have only testimonia and not fragmenta, and the Andrones (FHG II 346–352: Andron
Ephesius, Andron Tejus, Andron Halicarnassensis, and Andron Alexandrinus).
80
An example of an author without an introduction is Ptolemaeus Euergetes II (FHG III 186–
189). Examples of authors without fragments are Cadmus Milesius (FHG II 2–4) and Psaon
Plataeensis (FHG III 198).
81
Exceptions are Strabo Amasensis (FHG III 490–491), Dexippus Atheniensis (FHG III 667),
Eunapius Sardianus (FHG IV 9–10), Priscus Panites (FHG IV 70), Malchus Philadelphensis
(FHG IV 111–112), Petrus Patricius (FHG IV 183–184), and Bardesane (FHG V 61–62), who
have separate sections entitled Testimonia. On different types of testimonia about authors
and works, and on the problem of distinguishing between testimonia and fragmenta, see
Laks (1997), part. 237: “La couple fragment/témoignage fait partie de l’appareil critique
primaire de tous les historiens de l’Antiquité, quel que soit le domaine considéré.” A fur-
ther example is the collection of the fragments of the Presocratic philosophers edited by
Diels/Kranz (1959–1960), who separate not only testimonia (A: Leben und Schriften) and
fragmenta (B: Fragmente), but also passages of texts influenced by fragmentary philoso-
phers (C: Imitationen).
82
See Pherecydes (FHG I 70), Eunapius Sardianus (FHG IV 10–11), Priscus Panites (FHG IV
70–71), Malchus Philadelphensis (FHG IV 112), Petrus Patricius (FHG IV 184), and Menan-
der Protector (FHG IV 200–201).
83
When fragments can’t be attributed to a fragmentary work, they are collected in sections
entitled fragmenta incerta, fragmenta incertae sedis, fragmenta incertorum operum, etc.

a short Latin commentary.85 Latin translations of work titles and fragments are
printed in the lower part of the page. FHG fragments may include more than
one witness under the same number, while in other cases related witnesses are
separated with different letters attached to the same fragment number.86 Frag-
ment numbers can be also accompanied by other characters like parentheses,
square brackets, and question marks which mean that Müller contests, suggests,
or doubts the attribution of a fragment to a certain author.87
Figure 1.10. Hecataeus of Miletus, FHG I 1
Given that the FHG includes a wide range of authors and works, there are parts
of the collection with different layouts. For example, in FHG I the chapters of
the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus are printed in two columns with the Greek text on
the left and the Latin translation on the right.88 Müller doesn’t produce a crit-
85
In many other cases works are divided into books with headings like liber primus, liber
secundus, etc. See, for example, the books of the Atthis of Philochorus: FHG I 384–410.
86
An example of the first case is fr. 161 of Ephorus (FHG I 276), which includes source
texts from both the Suda and Harpocration. An example of the second case is fr. 221 of
Theopompus (FHG I 315), which has two different witnesses numbered as fr. 221a and fr.
221b. On problems concerning the treatment of this kind of fragments in the DFHG, see p.
151 n. 51.
87
See, for example, FHG I 1, frr. 5 (?) and 7 (?); 56, fr. (83); II 14, fr. (5); 29, fr. [2]; 34, fr. [22];
361, frr. (4) and (5). On the representation of these characters, see p. 151 n. 52.

ical apparatus for the text of the fragmenta, excluding those fragments that are
excerpta from manuscripts. Examples are Diodorus Siculus, Polybius, and Diony-
sus of Halicarnassus at the beginning of FHG II, Nicolaus of Damascus in FHG
III, and John of Antioch in the appendix of FHG IV and in FHG V.89 FHG I in-
cludes also the text of the Marmor Parium (with Latin translation, chronological
table, and commentary) and the Greek text of the Marmor Rosettanum (with a
French literal translation as well as a critical, historical, and archaeological com-
mentary).90 FHG V has a different structure because it is divided into two parts.
The first part has fragments of Aristodemus, Eusebius, Priscus, John of Antioch,
John Malalas, Critobulus, Photius, the author of the Periplus of the Euxine Sea,
and Dionysius of Byzantium, while the second part has only the French transla-
tion of eleven authors with Greek and Syrian historical fragments preserved in
Armenian sources.91 Each volume of FHG I–IV has a praefatio (except for vol. III),
an index nominum et rerum, an index auctorum, an index titulorum, and addenda
et corrigenda. The two parts of FHG V have two distinct prefaces and final indices
of names.92
The fifteen volumes of the first three parts of Die Fragmente der griechischen
Historiker (FGrHist) were edited by Felix Jacoby and printed by the publisher
Brill between 1923 and 1958: Part I. Genealogie und Mythographie, Part II. Zeit-
geschichte, Part III. Geschichte von Städten und Völkern (Horographie und Ethno-
graphie).93 Authors are numbered sequentially within groups arranged by liter-
ary genres, and the organization of the collection is much more complex than
the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG).94 The FGrHist has a formal dis-
tinction between testimonia (T) and fragmenta (F), and the text of fragments is
provided with a critical apparatus, but not with a translation into a modern lan-
guage. Introductions to authors and commentaries to fragments are printed in
separate volumes.95 Jacoby groups fragments under work titles and book num-
bers, when this kind of information is available in the source texts, otherwise he

classifies them as of uncertain location. He also prints with spaced-out letters
those parts of the fragments that seem to be direct quotations.96 Volumes are ac-
companied by introductions, tables of contents, addenda, delenda and corrigenda,
cross-references, concordances with the FHG, and indices auctorum.97 Commen-
taries of the collection are in German, except for the supplement of volume B of
Part III which is in English (A Commentary on the Ancient Historians of Athens).98
Figure 1.11. Hellanicus, FGrHist 323a 40–41
Figure 1.11 shows the first page of Hellanicus at the beginning of the section of
the fragmentary local historians of Athens (FGrHist III B). In this part of the col-
lection Hellanicus has the number 323a with 8 testimonia and 29 fragmenta. Testi-
monies and fragments of Hellanicus are also printed in other parts of the FGrHist
because the author is classified according to different literary genres: nr. 4 (30
testimonia and 202 fragmenta) in FGrHist I (genealogy and mythography); nrr.
601a (2 fragmenta), 608a (7 fragmenta), 645a (1 fragmentum), and 687a (3 testimo-
nia and 11 fragmenta) in FGrHist III (under local histories of Thessaly, Egypt, and
Persia). In these different sections, the same source texts that preserve testimo-

(1979–1980), and Mette (1985). Complete indices of fragmentary historians and source
texts of FGrHist fragments have been published by Bonnechère (1999) with description
and review by Marincola (2000).

nia and fragmenta of Hellanicus are frequently printed more than once because
their evidence covers different categories devised by Jacoby for classifying an-
cient Greek fragmentary historians.99 This situation is reflected in the Thesaurus
Linguae Graecae (TLG) online, which follows the printed edition of the FGrHist
and therefore reprints the same source texts when repeated by Jacoby in differ-
ent parts of his collection.100 Going back to figure 1.11, information in round
brackets after the number of testimonia and fragmenta includes cross-references
to other fragments in the FGrHist and correspondences with fragment numbers
of the FHG. Lines of the texts of fragments are numbered and referenced to in
the critical apparatus at the bottom of the page. Further elements in the page
may include fragmentary work titles and book numbers (in ancient Greek), and
chronological data.

1 Stesimbrotos of Thasos, a close contemporary of Kimon’s.
2 As recorded by Stesimbrotos of Thasos, a contemporary of his (sc. Perikles)
who had seen him, in his book entitled On Themistokles, Thukydides and Perikles.
3 In my opinion I am the best speaker of all men on Homer, and neither
Metrodoros of Lampsakos, nor Stesimbrotos of Thasos nor Glaukon or
anybody else, who has ever lived, could express so many and such beautiful
thoughts on Homer as I can.
4 Do you know a more foolish kind of people than the reciters of epic
poems? ... But you (sc. Nikeratos) gave Stesimbrotos and Anaximandros and
many others much money with the intention, that nothing of great value
should escape your notice.

taken in their opinion—wrote that he was a servant of Panyasis the poet; for
he was his and Stesimbrotos’ disciple.

1. ON THEMISTOKLES, THUKYDIDES AND PERIKLES
1 In spite of this Stesimbrotos asserts that Themistokles was a pupil of
Anaxagoras and attended the lectures of Melissos the physicist. But here he
is obviously mistaken in his dates, for when Perikles, who was much younger than
Themistokles, was besieging Samos, Melissos was the general who opposed him, while
Anaxagoras was one of Perikles’ intimate friends. For this reason it is easier to believe
those writers who say that Themistokles was an admirer of Mnesiphilos, a member of
the same deme of Phrearrus.

(FGrHist Continued): Part IV on Biography and Antiquarian Literature edited by
Guido Schepens and Stefan Schorn, and Part V on Die Geographen edited by Hans-
Joachim Gehrke and Felix Maier. A few fascicles of Part IV have been already pub-
lished as printed volumes, while the rest is currently being made available online
before the final printed publication.103 The online publication is part of the Jacoby
Online project that includes also the Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ) edited by Ian Wor-
thington, which is a “fully-revised and enlarged edition” of the FGrHist.104 One
of the aims of the continuation of Jacoby’s FGrHist is to make more accessible
the philological and historiographical complexity of textual remains of fragmen-
tary authors. This is one of the reasons why fascicles of Part IV have an English
translation of each fragment, and commentaries and notes are printed together
with testimonia and fragmenta and not in separate volumes (fig. 1.12).105 To dis-
tinguish the FGrHist Continued from the work of Jacoby, numbering of authors
of FGrHist Part IV starts from 1000 and numbers of authors of FGrHist Part V
starts from 2000.106

1.4 Fragmentary Texts and Printed Editions
39
The Italian series I Frammenti degli Storici Greci directed by Eugenio Lanzil-
lotta is publishing monographs on single authors and sections originally collected
by Felix Jacoby in the FGrHist.107 The books of the series follow the traditional
way of publishing fragmentary texts in printed editions. They include a distinc-
tion between testimonia and fragmenta, which are accompanied by loci paralleli,
a critical apparatus, a translation into Italian, and a historical commentary. The
ancient text of testimonies and fragments is provided with an extensive context,
in order to help readers understand the reasons of the textual reuse.108 Com-
mentaries have footnotes and volumes include also bibliographies, concordances,
and indices of names and sources.109 In general, testimonia and fragmenta follow
the sequence of the FGrHist, but the goal of the series is to supplement and ex-
tend whenever possible the work of Jacoby by reviewing his work and adding
new fragments discovered after his publication.110 Figure 1.13 shows an example
of one of the fragments of Istros the Callimachean.111 The number of the frag-
ment is always accompanied, when available, by a reference to the corresponding
number of the FGrHist and of the FHG. Given the amount of witnesses for each
fragmentary author and given that the scope of the series is to provide histor-
ical commentaries, the critical apparatus is not based on new examinations of
manuscripts, papyri, and other primary surces, but on a selection of the most
important readings published in other editions.112 The goal of the historical com-
mentary is to focus on the context of the fragment and on the roles of the quoting
author who has preserved it.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital
Revolution
This chapter describes how fragmentary authors and works are represented
in the first generation of digital libraries. It also analyzes how hypertextual
models have been developing a new dimension, where textual fragments
are envisioned as text reuses preserved in contexts that cover and therefore
hide their original form. The first section (2.1) presents the relationship
between digital scholarship and textual fragments by describing how frag-
mentary texts are currently collected and published in digital libraries that
still depend on the printed editorial practice. The section introduces digital
projects that include Greek and Latin fragmentary texts, devotes specific
attention to the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (2.1.1) and to the Jacoby Online
(2.1.2) with the example of the edition of the fragments of Istros the Calli-
machean (2.1.3), and presents digital collections of physical fragments such
as inscriptions, papyri, and manuscripts that bear textual evidence (2.1.4).
The second section (2.2) describes how editions of fragmentary authors and
works are representations of hypertexts and how hypertextual theories in
literature and digital media are important for a new publishing model of
fragmentary texts in a digital environment. The last section (2.3) presents
the concept of cover-text that has led philologists to move the attention from
decontextualized fragments to the role of the context that preserves quota-
tions and reuses of lost texts. Parallel to this is the implementation of com-
putational techniques for text reuse detection that are now also applied to
historical data (2.3.1). Given that they are strictly connected to text reuse,
the two last sections focus the attention on intertextual analysis (2.3.2) and
translation alignment (2.3.3), whose methods are beginning to be experi-
mented with literary texts and historical documents.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
2.1 Digital Scholarship and Textual Fragments
The digital revolution has been affecting primary and secondary textual sources
of Greek and Latin works.1 The first generation of digital libraries has converted
into a machine readable format the reconstructed text of single editions of Clas-
sical works. The goal of the second generation of digital libraries is to publish
multiple editions of the same work, reproduce the critical apparatus and all other
paratextual elements (prefaces, introductions, indices, bibliographies, notes, etc.),
and generate collaborative environments for new born-digital critical editions of
Greek and Latin sources.2 Fragmentary authors and works are directly involved
in this process because they consist of quotations and text reuses preserved by still
surviving sources. The problem is that the model according to which fragmentary
texts are currently represented in digital libraries is not satisfactory, because it
strongly depends on printed editorial practices. In the following pages, I describe
varieties of this model according to the most important collections of Greek and
Latin sources.
As far as ancient Greek sources are concerned, the Thesaurus Linguae Grae-
cae (TLG) is the most extended digital library that also includes many editions of
fragmentary authors and works. Given the huge amount of TLG texts and the im-
portance of the TLG Canon, I refer to section 2.1.1 for a more specific and detailed
analysis of the TLG treatment of fragmentary texts in its databank. The Perseus
Digital Library and the new Scaife Viewer don’t contain editions of fragmentary
authors and works, but the Open Greek and Latin (OGL) project has been offer-
ing a first set of digitized versions of printed editions of fragmentary authors and
works. In this case, the goal is to generate OCR outputs with a basic TEI XML
encoding of printed editions in order to produce machine readable files that allow
scholars to create digital versions of printed books and extract data for many dif-
ferent purposes. An example is constituted by the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum (DFHG) that will be described in chapter 4. A project specifically fo-
cused on producing digital editions of Greek fragmentary authors is Brill’s Jacoby
Online, which is continuing in a digital format the work started by Felix Jacoby
one century ago for collecting evidence of lost Greek historians. Considering its

43
specificity, the project will be discussed in section 2.1.2.3 As for Latin literature,
PHI Latin Texts is one of the electronic databases of Greek and Latin sources pro-
duced by the Packard Humanities Institute.4 PHI Latin Texts is a digital archive of
836 Latin works from 362 authors up to 200 CE with a selection of sources from
later antiquity. The Canon of the PHI Latin Texts offers an overview of authors
and works that are part of the collection with references to the printed editions
on which digital texts are based: http://latin.packhum.org/canon. Authors and
works are identified with numbers and abbreviations. For example, Marcus Tul-
lius Cicero is [0474 Cic] and Cicero’s In Catilinam (ed. A.C. Clark 1905) is [0474
013 Cic].5
PHI Latin Texts includes collections of fragmentary authors, such as the His-
toricorum Romanorum Reliquiae (HRR) by Hermann Peter.6 An example are the
fragments of the Latin Annales of Fabius Pictor [0061 001 hist].7 In this case,
PHI reproduces the text of only three of the six Latin fragments of Fabius Pictor
originally edited by Peter under the section Fabii Pictoris Latini Annales (3, 4, and
3
On these projects see also section 1.3. There are other still in progress plans for producing
digital editions of single Greek fragmentary authors or groups of authors belonging to
specific genres, as for example the fragments of Protagoras of Abdera by Tazuko van Berkel
at Leiden University, the fragments of Demetrius of Scepsis by Alexandra Trachsel at the
University of Hamburg, the fragments of Sceptic philosophers by Stéphane Marchand at
the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, and the fragments of ancient Greek rhetoric and
oratory by Jan Heßler at the University of Würzburg. Another project is the collection and
edition of fragments and testimonies of historians from late antiquity at the University of
Düsseldorf, where they are producing printed editions with an online version. The project
is still in beta version and has been conceived as a traditional printed critical edition with
a parallel online presence: see Fischer (2017) 267–268.
4
These databases were originally published as CD-ROMs. PHI 5.3 was a collection of Latin
texts now freely accessible at http://latin.packhum.org: see Kozák (2018). PHI 7 was a
database of Greek inscriptions and documentary papyri. Greek inscriptions are online at
https://inscriptions.packhum.org, while documentary papyri are part of Papyri.info. On
PHI Greek Inscriptions, see p. 69.
5
The Canon of the PHI is now ingested in a new project for publishing and curating critical
editions of Latin texts, which is under development as the Digital Latin Library (DLL) and
which is also going to include fragmentary authors and works: https://digitallatin.org. The
HTML code of the PHI Canon embeds tags and attributes that can be used for extracting
data and reusing it for other purposes. The DLL has extracted this data and integrated
it in its catalog, which is a Linked Open Data (LOD) resource built according to the best
practices of library information science: https://catalog.digitallatin.org. For example,
Marcus Tullius Cicero is cataloged as DLL #A5129 and its entry is available at https://cata
log.digitallatin.org/dll-author/a5129. For a presentation of the DLL project, see Huskey
(2019) and Digital Latin Library Project (2021).

See https://latin.packhum.org/author/61. This data is ingested in the DLL Catalog with a
DLL identifier (DLL #W2649): https://catalog.digitallatin.org/dll-work/w2649. Fragments
of Fabius Pictor have been encoded in TEI XML as part of the Digital Fabius Pictor project
developed at the University of Leipzig as a result of a collaboration between the Institute
of Computer Science and the Historical Seminar: see Straßburger (2018).

6).8 Moreover, PHI doesn’t publish the critical apparatus, the commentary, and
the context of the witnesses as Peter does, but reproduces only the words that
can be attributed to the original lost texts of Fabius Pictor (fig. 2.1).
An identical treatment of the Latin fragments of the Annales of Fabius Pictor
is available in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina (BTL) and in the Library of Latin
Texts Series A (LLT–A). The BTL online provides electronic access to all printed
editions of the Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina with a database that includes about
13 million word forms.9 The BTL publishes the same portions of fragments 3, 4,
and 6 as in PHI Latin Texts (fig. 2.2). It allows to export a PDF file with the
text of the fragments and also different citation formats with a permanent URL.10
The Library of Latin Texts Series A (LLT–A) is part of a cluster of full-text Latin
databases and dictionaries which contains over 78 million Latin words from more
than 3,800 works attributed to ca. 1,200 authors.11 LLT–A provides the same por-
tions of fragments 3, 4, and 6 of Fabius Pictor as in PHI Latin Texts and in the
BTL, and allows users to export a PDF file with information about the author,
the texts, and the reference edition (figg. 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5).12 PHI Latin Texts
includes under the name of Fabius Pictor also the fragments of the Iuris Pontifi-
cis Libri ([0061 002 iur]) according to the edition Iurisprudentiae Anteiustinianae
Reliquiae by P.E. Huschke, E. Seckel, and B. Kübler (vol. I, 1908). LLT–A collects
8
Peter (1870–1914) I 112–113 (Greek fragments are at 5–39). PHI seems to publish only the
fragments that Peter attributed to Quintus Fabius Pictor and not those that he questioned
as being of Numerius Fabius Pictor. On these problems of attribution, see also FHG III
80–93, FGrHist (BNJ) 809, Cornell (2013) I 163–166, and Woodman (2015) 4–22.

As far as Latin fragments are concerned, I also point to Grammatici disiecti:
sources fragmentaires pour l’histoire de la grammaire latine (https://gradis.hyp
otheses.org/). The project is directed by Alessandro Garcea and is “a research
blog dedicated to gathering, for the first time, all Latin grammatical texts which
are preserved exclusively in fragmentary form.” The “primary purpose is to pub-
lish bio-bibliographical sketches of the authors of such texts, be they grammari-
ans, teachers, erudite writers or any other author who may have written works
on grammar, regardless of their position in society or their linguistic activity.”14
According to the description, Grammatici disiecti provides through a WordPress
website a list of Latin fragmentary grammarians dated between the 3rd century
BC and the 4th century CE. As soon as they are ready, the project publishes sep-
arate pages with complete bio-bibliographical presentations of the authors of the
collection.
Beyond the projects mentioned in these pages, there are also other resources
for accessing in many different ways digital versions of printed editions of frag-
mentary authors and works. For example, publishing companies have been of-
fering this kind of service through online subscriptions for individual and insti-
tutional customers. The Digital Loeb Classical Library offers “an interconnected,
fully searchable, perpetually growing, virtual library of all that is important in
Greek and Latin literature.”15 The online collection counts more than 520 vol-
14
A new edition of the corpus is in preparation for Les Belles Lettres editions (Collection des
Universités de France). As part of an interest in Latin grammarians, the project is connected
to the Corpus Grammaticorum Latinorum (CGL): see Garcea/Cinato et al. (2010).
15
See https://www.loebclassics.com. As of 2021, the annual subscription for individual
users is priced at $170 for the first year and $70 for subsequent consecutive years. Prices
for academic and public libraries depend on the size of the institutions interested in the
subscription.

umes of Latin, Greek, and English texts, which are available in an interface that
allows readers to browse, search, bookmark, annotate, and share content. The
Loeb online has also editions of fragmentary works, as for example the Greek
epic fragments published by Martin West in 2003 (fig. 2.7).16 Other examples
that are accessible with a subscription or direct payment are the Oxford Scholarly
Editions Online (OSEO), that enables readers to search across the texts, navigate
through reference forms and look up words in the Oxford Latin Dictionary (fig.
2.8),17 or the online Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana
that has put online PDF files of its editions including fragmentary authors and
works.18
Figure 2.7. Digital Loeb Classical Library: M.L. West, Greek Epic Fragments
A different kind of service is offered by mass digitization projects like Google
Books, Internet Archive, and HathiTrust, which have been giving free access to
millions of scanned copies of books that are in the public domain. These col-
lections contain also many volumes about Classical sources, allowing scholars
to rediscover past editions of ancient authors that comprise fragmentary ones.19

Needless to say that this is the first step toward an extraordinary contribution to
the preservation of an inestimable patrimony of past scholarship, which is often
neglected, not only because it is considered old and out-of-date, but also because
in many cases it is difficult to locate and consult in traditional libraries. An ex-
ample, among many others, is represented by the five volumes of the Fragmenta
Historicorum Graecorum (FHG) that will be described in chapter 4. These projects
offer not only the possibility to consult and read scholarly printed editions, but
also to get source files for experimenting with Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) techniques. As for ancient Greek sources, this kind of experimentation
is being performed by the Open Greek and Latin (OGL) project and by Lace: Greek
OCR, which is directed by Bruce Robertson at Mount Allison University.20 The
project has an online catalog with an updated list of OCRed texts including edi-
tions of fragmentary authors and works. Through the list, it is possible to access
single books, visualize the alignment of the image of each page with its OCR
stages, download the relevant files, and also contribute with manual OCR post-
correction.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
2.1.1 Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG)
As I mentioned in chapter 1, since the beginning the TLG has addressed the prob-
lem of dealing with lost authors in the Canon and in the online collection. As far
as the catalog and the publication of textual fragments are concerned, the TLG fol-
lows standards and conventions of printed editions of fragmentary authors and
works.21 An example is the fragmentary historian Hecataeus of Miletus, who
corresponds to tlg0538. In the TLG Hecataeus is classified as historicus, is dated
between the 6th and the 5th century BC (6–5 B.C.), and has the geographical
epithet Milesius. In this case, the reference edition is FGrHist 1 and the TLG fol-
lows the arrangement of Felix Jacoby with his distinction between 25 testimonia
(tlg0538.001) and 373 fragmenta (tlg0538.002).22
Figure 2.9. TLG: Hecataeus Milesius (tlg0538)
The TLG adds two other witnesses to Jacoby’s fragment 145 that were published
by Hans Joachim Mette as 145bis (a and b) (tlg0538.003).23 Figure 2.9 shows the
pop-up window of Hecataeus with bibliographic references and the word count
of the texts of testimonies and fragments, excluding the apparatus criticus and
the commentary that are not reproduced in the TLG. Figures 2.10 and 2.11 show
how Hecataeus’ fragment 145bis was originally published by Mette and how is
replicated in the online TLG, which closely reproduces the layout of the printed
page and adds symbols to mark lines in its files: l1 marks the line with the ref-
erence to the witness until the colon, 1 marks the line with the Greek text of the
21
For a list of epithets and work classifications that identify fragmentary authors and works
belonging to different literary genres in the TLG, see pp. 21 and 23.

For the fragmenta of Hecataeus, the TLG provides further classifications (Historica,
Mythographa, and Periegesis).

fragment, and @1 stands for page end.24 The TLG provides a link to cite the page
with the edition of Mette, which incorporates author and work numbers (0538
and 003): http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/Iris/Cite?0538:003:0 (fig. 2.12).25 As part
of the online TLG services, it is also possible to perform morphological analyses
and obtain statistics about the words of the texts of the fragments (see below).
Figure 2.10. Mette (1978) 6 = Hecataeus, FGrHist 1 F 145bis
Figure 2.11. TLG: Hecataeus, FGrHist 1 F 145bis = Mette (1978) 6
Figure 2.12. TLG: link to cite Hecataeus, FGrHist 1 F 145bis = Mette (1978) 6
Another example is Hellanicus of Lesbos, who is represented in a similar way
in the TLG with a reproduction of the testimonia and the fragmenta from the
FGrHist and Mette (1978). In this case, the TLG allows users to select fragments
from the different FGrHist sections of Hellanicus arranged by Felix Jacoby, and
24
@1: “marks end of page in source text regardless of whether page is part of the citation
system. All files end in @1”. This method seems to be not consistent in the TLG corpus.
Cf. the example of Hellanicus below.
25
On TLG author and work numbers, see p. 19 n. 55. The TLG doesn’t provide identifiers
for single fragments: in this case, 003 refers to the edition of Mette and not specifically to
fragment 145bis with its two witnesses.

52
2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
there is also a specific reference to fragments on papyrus (figg. 2.13 and 2.14).26
As far as the layout of the FGrHist page is concerned, the TLG tries to replicate
it. Figures 2.15 and 2.16 show how Hellanicus’ fragments 2–5 (FGrHist 323a) are
represented in the printed edition of Jacoby’s FGrHist and in the online TLG. The
TLG reproduces the text of the fragments including references to other source
texts and follows the FGrHist in printing with spaced-out letters those parts of
the fragments that seem to be direct quotations (cf. p. 36). Missing elements are
the critical apparatus and therefore line numbers for the text of the fragments,
references in round brackets to the corresponding numbers of the fragments in
other parts of the FGrHist and in the FHG, references in angle brackets to other
fragments of the same FGrHist section, chronological data in the margin of the
page, and references to fragmentary work titles (in this case Ἀτθίς) and to book
numbers (in this case Β) according to which fragments are arranged in the col-
lection.
Figure 2.13. TLG: Hellanicus (tlg0539)
Considering that the TLG is not only a digital collection of texts but also a cata-
log of ancient Greek works based on printed editions, it would have been better
to include at least the reference to fragmentary work titles and book numbers
provided by Felix Jacoby, because they are a fundamental element to understand
26
PSI X 1173; P.Oxy. X 1241; P.Giss. 307v; fr. 133bis (= P.Oxy. XXVI 2442). It is not clear the
criterion used by the TLG for selecting these papyri, because there are other fragments of
Hellanicus preserved on papyrus but not mentioned in the breakdown: FGrHist 4 F 19b
(P.Oxy. VIII 1084), F 68 (P.Oxy. XIII 611), and F 197bis (= PSI XIV 1390). There is also an
inscription among the testimonia: FGrHist 4 T 30 (IG II/III2 2363). On the evidence of these
physical fragments, see section 2.1.4.

theless, the online TLG provides a very powerful search engine and useful tools
for performing morphological analyses and getting statistics and n-grams, which
represent an invaluable addition to printed editions of ancient source texs. For
example, by selecting the word Ἀτθίδος in F 2 of Hellanicus (FGrHist 323a), it is
possible to get not only the morphological analysis of the word with links to the
entry in different lexica (LSJ, MiddleLS, and DGE), but also statistics about the use
and the distribution of the word in the TLG corpus: A summary of the use of the
lemma (fig. 2.17), its distribution by century, its relative distribution by century
(fig. 2.18), its highest use by author, and its relative distribution by author. The
TLG provides also work statistics and in this case, for example, it is possible to
visualize results for the FGrHist fragments of Hellanicus reproduced in the TLG
(tlg0539.002) (fig. 2.19).28
Figure 2.17. TLG: statistics for the lemma Ἀτθίς, -ίδος, ἡ(summary)
These examples, even if limited to historians, show how fragmentary authors and
works are accessible through the TLG. The same dependency on the printed ed-
itorial practice is evident if we examine fragmentary authors belonging to other
literary genres in the TLG. Moreover, one of the downsides of this structure of
the TLG is the fact that the corpus has duplicates of texts. This phenomenon is
intrinsic to scholarship of fragmentary literature, because “a collection of frag-
27
To our knowledge, titles (tituli) of fragmentary works are present in the TLG if they are
the unique evidence of a fragmentary work: cf. p. 19. As for fragmentary historians, an
example is the TLG author Promathidas (tlg2300) with one titulus (Ἡμίαμβοι: tlg2300.003)
from Lloyd-Jones/Parsons (1983) 345.
28
It is also possible to get statistics for the entire corpus of Hellanicus or only for the FGrHist
testimonia (tlg0539.001) and for the fragmentum published by Mette (1978) (tlg0539.003).

ments simply duplicates the information contained in other books in a good li-
brary. All the texts it brings are usually available elsewhere.” In a philological
world dominated by printed books, this condition is inevitable in order to collect
knowledge and “concentrate information otherwise widely disseminated.”29 In a
digital world, where resources are more easily accessible and linkable, the inher-
itance of printed editorial methods by digital libraries is problematic, because the
digital duplication of texts generates distorted results.30
Figure 2.20. TLG: N-grams for Ἀττικῶν, δεδήλωκεν, and Ἴστρος
Going back to the examples mentioned above, if we take into consideration F 2 of
Hellanicus (FGrHist 323a), we can see how the context of the fragment is repeated
several times in the TLG (fig. 2.20). If we activate the TLG n-gram functionality
for the string δεδήλωκεν Ἴστρος ἐν γʹ τῶν Ἀττικῶν, we can see that the text is
repeated four times in the TLG: as Hellanicus FGrHist 4 F 39 (tlg0539.002) and
323a F 2 (tlg0539.002), as Ister FHG I fr. 7 (tlg1450.004), and as Harpocr. Lex. s.v.
Παναθήναια (tlg1389.002). The text is also repeated under Androtion FHG I fr.

1 (tlg1125.003), but ends before the quoted string.31 In all these cases, the only
citable evidence is the text of the Lexicon of Harpocration, which is the surviving
text that reuses the lost passages of Hellanicus, Ister, and Androtion and which
is therefore repeated multiple times in the editions of these fragmentary authors.
If this situation has the advantage of allowing users to visualize the same text in
different editions, the problem is that from a computational point of view these
repetitions generate wrong results when querying the TLG corpus. They also
produce the wrong impression of the existence of fragmentary texts that, as a
matter of fact, don’t exist any more but are only preserved through quotations
and reuses in other texts.
Fragmentary texts come not only from quotations and text reuses, but also
from material fragments like papyri, inscriptions, and excerpts in manuscripts.
In the example of Hellanicus mentioned above, there are six fragments preserved
on papyrus and one testimony from an inscription (fig. 2.13).32 In this case the
texts of the fragments are reproduced following the content and the layout of
the FGrHist and of Mette (1978), but there are no links to external resources.33
Another example is the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, which is a historiographical work
preserved only on physical fragments. Also in this case the text is reproduced in
the TLG following its reference printed editions (tlg0558).34
2.1.2 Jacoby Online (JO)
Jacoby Online (JO) is a project specifically aimed at ancient Greek fragmentary
historians.35 It is maintained by the Dutch publisher Brill and is part of a big
scholarly enterprise whose goal is to continue and update the editorial work of
Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (FGrHist) began by Felix Jacoby in the
Twenties of last century (cf. pp. 35 ff.). The project is also the result of an ongo-
ing effort to make more user-friendly and accessible the volumes of the FGrHist,

The complete text of the lexical entry is published only under the Lexicon of Harpocration,
while in the other cases the text is partially cut in the same way as it is published in the
FHG and in the FGrHist.

which is a notoriously difficult tool to consult, especially for students of Classics.
The first steps of this effort were the publication of complete indices to FGrHist I–
III by Pierre Bonnechère and the production of a Windows compatible CD-ROM
version of the fifteen volumes of Jacoby’s FGrHist I–III and of Bonnechère’s in-
dices.36 The CD-ROM was welcomed as an “excellent tool” and as “a miracle of
20th-century scholarship with a miracle of 21st-century technology.”37 For the
first time, users had the possibility to search numerical and alphabetical lists of
the 856 FGrHist authors and to be immediately brought with one click to the rela-
vant part of the collection concerning the requested historian.38 Those who have
spent many hours in the library to consult the printed version of the FGrHist
— looking for information about authors scattered in the fifteen volumes of the
collection — greately enjoyed the advantages of a single CD-ROM with search
and hypertextual functionalities, and the possibility to visualize notes of the crit-
ical apparatus in dialogue babbles appearing on lines with textual problems and
variants.39 The CD-ROM version was based on the layout of the printed edition
(“page-based”) and the aim was to produce, as far as possible, an exact represen-
tation of the printed volumes.40
The CD-ROM version of the FGrHist is now superseded by the online edition
which is part of the Jacoby Online project. The current online version is under
revision and a new interface is going to be launched as part of a collaboration with
the company Eldarion, that has also developed the Scaife Viewer for the Perseus
Digital Library: https://scaife.perseus.org. An overview of the new version of the
Jacoby Online will be described in this section after a description of the current
version, which has been used by many scholars in the last ten years.41

For a detailed description of the CD-ROM, see Marincola (2005), who also points at its
limits, such as the price (€ 1,500) and the fact that pieces of information on the margins of
the FGrHist pages were not interactive and that the addenda and corrigenda sections had
to be manually searched.
41
I’m very grateful to Ernest Suyver and Mirjam Elbers for giving me access to the demo
version of the new Jacoby Online and in general for the opportunity to work with them
as a contributor and copy editor of the Jacoby Online project: see section 2.1.3. This col-
laboration now also includes the connection between the Jacoby Online and the Digital
Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) project, that I have been implementing and
that is described in chapter 4.

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
In order to be accessed and consulted, the Jacoby Online project requires a
subscription and includes five sections:42
1. Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker Part I–III. This is the online ver-
sion of the first three parts of the FGrHist originally published by Felix Jacoby.
It gives access to alphabetical and numerical lists of fragmentary authors, to the
“commentary on cities and peoples,” and to the addenda. In the “Prelims,” it is pos-
sible to consult an introduction to the life and the work of Felix Jacoby, notes for
readers (abbreviations, corrigenda, and indexes), and prefaces. Texts of fragments
are reproduced as they appear in the FGrHist, together with commentaries and
notes. Introductions, testimonia, fragmenta, commentaries, notes, and selected
addenda to every author are published together in the same web page. A menu
on the upper right part of the page contains links to each testimony and frag-
ment. Introductions to authors contain also note numbers, but without links to
the actual notes that seem not to have been included in the online collection. Fig-
ure 2.21 shows the example of FGrHist 323a F 2 in the Jacoby Online that can be
compared with the printed page at figure 2.15. References to corresponding FHG
and FGrHist fragments have been removed, as well as the notes on the margins of
the printed pages. Another difference with the printed edition is the addition of
links to the corresponding BNJ fragments (see below). Critical notes to the text
of the fragments are reproduced in footnotes at the bottom of the web page and
have numbers following the numerical sequence of the notes to the commentary.
Those parts of the fragments that Jacoby considered to be direct quotations are
reproduced with orange coloured letters and not with spaced-out letters as in the
FGrHist. Search and index functions are shared with other parts of the Jacoby
Online.43
2. Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker Part IV. This is the online ver-
sion of the FGrHist Continued on ancient Greek biography and antiquarian lit-
erature that Felix Jacoby was never able to publish. According to the plan, this
section will consist of 27 book volumes, some of which have been already pub-
lished in a printed format.44 Before the final printed publication, fragmentary au-
thors are progressively published online following the editorial guidelines of the
Jacoby Online project. This means that, after each introduction to authors with
interactive footnotes, there is a “brief encyclopaedia-style entry” with chrono-
logical, literary, and geographical metadata. A similar entry is at the beginning
of each testimony and each fragment with information on the witnesses, their

As of 2021, the “online subscription price” is € 1,1761 with an “annual update fee” of € 1,285.

chronology, language, and literary genre. Every testimony and fragment is ac-
companied by an English translation and a full commentary (see figure 2.22 to be
compared with the printed page at figure 1.12).45 Critical notes are expressed in
footnotes and there are interactive links to fragments of other parts of the FGrHist
and the BNJ. Each author section has a bibliography at the end of the web page.
Unlike the FGrHist, which was the work of one scholar, FGrHist IV is the result of
a team of researchers working on different authors under the direction of Stefan
Schorn and an editorial board. Search and index functions are shared with other
sections of the Jacoby Online.
3. Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker Part V. This is the part of the
FGrHist Continued that concerns geography. The plan is to publish testimonies
and fragments of 96 Greek historians with the collaboration of a team of scholars
under the direction of Hans-Joachim Gehrke and Felix Maier.46 The online edito-
rial layout is the same of FGrHist IV and search and index functions are shared
with other sections of the Jacoby Online.
4. Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ). The BNJ is described by its editor-in-chief Ian
Worthington in the home page of the project: “Brill’s New Jacoby is a fully-revised
and enlarged edition of Jacoby’s Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker I–III,
providing new texts of the ancient historians in many instances as well as several
new historians and many new fragments of existing historians that were either
unknown to Jacoby or excluded by him. Especially important is that for the first
time ever commentaries are provided on the final 248 historians in FGrHist I–
45
Given that this is an ongoing project, it is possible to see variants and changes in the
editorial treatment of authors and fragments.

III, which Jacoby was unable to prepare before his death. In addition, and also
for the first time, Brill’s New Jacoby presents facing English translations of all
the testimonia and fragments, new, critical commentaries on all the testimony
and fragments, and a brief encyclopedia-style entry about each historian’s life
and works, with a select bibliography.”47 Figure 2.23 shows the example of Istros
the Callimachean (BNJ 334 T 1). Editors of the BNJ are provided with guidelines
and a template to be filled in with metadata and data about fragmentary authors
and their works. In order to be consistent, the project offers also lists of sub-
jects for authors, testimonies, and fragments, and special tags are used by copy
editors for hyperlinks and anchors of named entities, bibliographic elements, tes-
timonies’ and fragments’ numbers.48 Each entry has a final Biographical essay
on the fragmentary author and a bibliography.49 The BNJ keeps the numbering
system of Jacoby and new authors are inserted in the appropriate section with
the same number as the preceding author followed by A or B in order to distin-
guish them.50 Following the principle of offering a more user-friendly version of
the FGrHist, the BNJ provides not only new commentaries and English transla-
tions, but also expanded references to source texts and to bibliographic entries,
chronological and literary information, and links and metadata to help readers
contextualize fragments and witnesses. Search and index functions are shared
with other sections of the Jacoby Online.
5. Brill’s New Jacoby, Second Edition (BNJ2). This part is a “revised and en-
larged edition of Brill’s New Jacoby (BNJ). New additions include an apparatus
criticus and a discussion of the provenance of each fragment where relevant, as
well as revised commentaries on the ancient historians in BNJ and updated bib-
liographies, all of which set BNJ2 significantly apart from the previous edition.”
The online editorial layout is the same of BNJ and search and index functions are
shared with other sections of the Jacoby Online.
As mentioned before, the current version of the Jacoby Online is going to be
substitued by a new version in the near future. This new version is presented in a
webpage entitled Documentation for Jacoby Online, which is maintained by Brill
Scholary Editions and published with GitBook.51 Given that this documentation
is public, my aim is not to repeat it here, but to summarize two main character-
istics of the new Jacoby Online there were also discussed as part of a seminar

65
Figure 2.24. New Jacoby Online demo (early 2020)
organized at Brill in Leiden on January 22, 2020 with the participation of Stefan
Schorn, James Tauber, Ian Worthington, Cecily Robinson, Mirjam Elbers, Ernest
Suyver and myself. The first important characteristic in order to combine the
needs of the contributors and the needs of the Jacoby Online is the substitution
of Brill XML files, that were used in the past, with BPT files as a basic format to
produce TEI XML files for the publication on Brill Scholarly Editions (fig. 2.24).52
New extended Guidelines for authors have been written about entry structure,
publication statement, the historian, testimonia, fragments, biographical essay
and bibliography.
The second important aspect of the new Jacoby Online is the adoption of
the CITE Architecture to produce uniform and stable identifiers of the following
seven JO objects:53 1) textgroup: a group of fragments, united by origin, theme,
and/or (most common) authorship; 2) fragment: a textual remnant of an other-
wise lost work (“Fragment is a child of textgroup. We could have a collection level
= fgrh”); 3) historian: author of an (in the case of JO) lost historiographical work
(“Historian is metadata about (a version of) a textgroup”); 4) work: (in the case
of JO) lost historiographical work (“Work is metadata about (a version of) a frag-
ment”); 5) source: text (itself a work) containing a citation of or reference to a lost
work or its author; 6) entry: a textgroup as analyzed by modern scholars (“Entry
is metadata about (a version of) a textgroup”); 7) edition: edition of the source
texts (“Edition is metadata about (a version of) a source”). Jacoby Online adopts
both CITE and CTS URNs to cite texts, papyri, inscriptions and fragments. The
52
BPT stands for Brill Plain Text and the language of these files is Markdown with some Brill-
specific extensions. BPT supports the inclusion of additional mark-up, such as Leiden+
for epigraphical texts (http://papyri.info/docs/leiden_plus), YAML for metadata and
references, and HTML. Figure 2.24 shows an example of the demo of the new Jacoby Online
with fragments of Hippias of Elis and the widget for the metadata about the historian.

syntax of each URN includes fgrh as the textgroup identifier and jo as the version
identifier. Table 2.1 shows examples for Hekataios of Miletos (FGrHist 1).

2.1.3 Printed and Digital Fragments: Istros the Callimachean
The edition of the fragments of Istros the Callimachean is an example of a work
shifting from printed to digital characteristics. I originally conceived this work
in the form of a printed book as part of the Italian series I Frammenti degli Storici
Greci. The first volume containing the fragments on Athens and Attica was pub-
lished in 2009 and its characteristics have been described in section 1.4.54 I pub-
lished a second edition with the testimonia and all the seventy-seven fragments of
Istros the Callimachean in 2015 for the Brill’s New Jacoby, as the result of an invi-
tation by Ian Worthington to complete the work originally begun by the late Steve
Jackson (fig. 2.25).55 This edition presents fragments according to the traditional
model of printed editions, but with the addition of metadata and hyperlinks that
will be further expanded in the revision of the fragments for the second edition
of BNJ and as part of the new version of the Jacoby Online.

2.1 Digital Scholarship and Textual Fragments
67
Figure 2.26. DFHG: Ister (concordance of editions)
As it will be extensively described in chapters 4 and 5, one of the goals of new
born-digital editions of fragmentary texts is to expand and connect resources. As
far as Istros is concerned, the first step was accomplished by producing the digital
version of its fragments published by Karl Müller in the Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum, which is fundamental to understand the edition of Felix Jacoby in
Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker. Figure 2.26 shows the concordance
among the entries of Istros in different resources as part of the Müller-Jacoby
Table of Concordance of the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum project
(see section 4.4.3). Future work will conceive the edition of the fragments of Istros
the Callimachean not as the extraction of chunks of text (fragmenta), but as the
annotation of pieces of information concerning him and his works in the context
of surviving sources.56 The lack of digital versions of all the sources that preserve
testimonies and text reuses of Istros is still a limit for the accomplishment of
this task, but preliminary results are now available through the Digital Athenaeus
project (see chapter 5).
Figure 2.27 shows the lemma Ἴστρος and its inflected forms in the Named
Entities Concordance of the Deipnosophists.57
The concordance highlights the
name of Istros (red) (and the homonymous river) and other named entities (blue-
green) pertaining to him, such as other authors, ethnica, and work titles that are
cited in the immediate context. The extraction and annotation of Named Entities
pertaining to text reuses of lost authors is the beginning of a new philological
practice that will enable scholars to produce new digital and dynamic editions of
fragmentary authors and works within their context of transmission.

2.1.4 Digital Collections of Physical Fragmentary Texts
The expression fragmentary texts refers not only to quotations and text reuses,
but also to physical fragments that bear textual evidence, which includes many
examples of literary texts. As we have seen before, the TLG and the Jacoby On-
line collect also texts of ancient Greek authors preserved on material fragments.
Scholars interested in getting more information about this type of sources have
now at their disposal many digital projects and resources devoted to collecting
data about physical fragments (inscriptions, papyri, manuscripts, etc.). A com-
plete description of these resources is beyond the scope of this volume, but, in
order to be up to date with them, I refer to the Digital Classicist Wiki, which is
a hub for collecting guidelines, suggestions, and catalogs of digital projects con-
cerning the Graeco-Roman world.58 In this section, I limit my presentation to the
most important digital reference tools that can be used in a scholarly work about
ancient Greek fragmentary authors and works.

2.1 Digital Scholarship and Textual Fragments

The PHI Greek Inscriptions is an electronic database produced by the Packard
Humanities Institute.59 It offers a comprehensive collection of searchable Greek
inscriptions arranged by ancient regions and modern scholarly collections. The
reconstructed text of the inscriptions is reproduced according to the main corpora
and reference printed editions, but without the critical apparatus and the com-
mentaries. This resource allows users to find the text of inscriptions that have
been classified also as testimonia or fragmenta of fragmentary authors. Examples
are IG II/III2 2363, IG XII 5, 444, and IG XIV 1293. IG II/III2 2363 is a 2nd-1st cen-
tury BC inscription from Piraeus with a catalog of mostly Attic writers including
Hellanicus (col. 2, 4 = FGrHist (BNJ) 4 T 30).60 IG XII 5, 444 is a 3rd century BC
inscription with the text of the Marmor Parium, which is a historiographical frag-
mentary work attested only on stone (= Jacoby (1904) and FGrHist (BNJ) 239).61
IG XIV 1293 is a marble plaque (Tabula Albana) with inscriptions of uncertain

the PHI Greek Inscriptions website (fig. 2.28).63 The resource provides links to
other publications within the PHI database, but not to external resources. Each
inscription has a unique reference number, which is also embedded in a stable

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution

and now expanding to the Ancient World in general.64 Trismegistos offers many
resources and gives the possibility to obtain metadata concerning also physical
fragments that have been attributed to fragmentary authors and works. An in-
teresting service is the Authors database for searching ancient author names and
work titles. The aim of the resource is to collect information about all authors who
wrote between 800 BC and 800 CE including also “authors attested only as frag-
ments in other works.” As for now, the resource is based on the Leuven Database
of Ancient Books (LDAB) and Trismegistos editors warn users about limits, errors,
and possible lack of data.
Going back to the examples mentioned in the previous pages, Trismegistos
has an entry about Hellanicus of Lesbos with a stable URI: https://www.trisme
gistos.org/author/358. The resource provides metadata (chronology, onomastics,
ethnic, genre, language and bibliography) and links to different types of external
resources such as Wikipedia, the manuscript collection of Pinakes, the Perseus Cat-
alog, the TLG Canon, and Jacoby Online (fig. 2.29). As far as Hellanicus’ works are
concerned, Trismegistos collects three papyri differentiating them between direct
attestations and quotations (fig. 2.30): P.Oxy. VIII 1084 (Atlantis), P.Oxy. XXVI
64
For a detailed history and description of the project, see Reggiani (2017) 56–73, and Depauw
(2018). Trismegistos was an open resource that, starting from January 1, 2020, requires a
subscription to access all search interfaces and visualisations due to shortcuts in funding:
1) unlimited access through a subscribed institution (€ 990,91 excl. VAT per year), 2) insti-
tutional access for one concurrent user through a login (€ 299 per year excl. VAT), and 3)
personal single user access through a login (€ 199 per year incl. VAT).

2442 + P.Oxy. LXXV 5039 (opus incertum), and PSI XIV 1390 (opus incertum).65
P.Oxy. VIII 1084 is a papyrus dated between the 1st and the 2nd century CE,
whose text has been attributed to the Atlantis of Hellanicus of Lesbos (FGrHist
(BNJ) 4 F 19b). Trismegistos offers a detailed description of the papyrus including
the attribution to Hellanicus (direct attestation), a reference to the FGrHist, and a
link to Papyri.info for other metadata and pictures (fig. 2.31).66 P.Oxy. XXVI 2442
is constituted by several fragments of papyrus dated to the 2nd and 3rd centuries
CE with fragments and scholia to Pindar that mention the name of Hellanicus
(fr. 29, 1–8 = Mette (1978) 7, fr. 133bis = BNJ 4 F 101a). P.Oxy. LXXV 5039 is
associated to the previous papyrus because it belongs to the same set of rolls, but
doesn’t contain the name of Hellanicus. Trismegistos has a page with metadata
about both papyri and includes the reference to Hellanicus specifying that this is
a reference to his name (quoted) and not one of his fragments (direct attestation),
but in the bibliography doesn’t refer to the BNJ.67 PSI XIV 1390 is constituted by
three fragments dated to the 2nd century CE and contains a scholion to Euphorion
that mentions the name of Hellanicus (FGrHist 4 F 197bis = BNJ 4 F 197a). Tris-
megistos has a page on the papyrus with metadata, a reference to the fact that
Hellanicus is quoted in the text but this is not one of his direct attestations, and
a link to the database of the Papiri della Società Italiana with further information
and pictures.68
The TM Authors database allows also to search work titles. An example
is the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia. In this case Trismegistos collects — as direct at-
testations under the heading Anonymus of the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, Hellenica
Oxyrhynchia — the fragments from the collections of Oxyrhynchos, Florence, and
65
It is not clear why PSI XIV 1390 is repeated twice, but Trismegistos editors warn about
possible duplicates still present in the database. Trismegistos text types are related to the
Leuven Database of Ancient Books (LDAB) metadata. As of now, there are four text types
in Trismegistos: 1) Direct attestation (13,445 of the 15,101 attestations of authors in texts):
this means that the text preserves the work of author X; 2) Quoted (882 attestations): this
means that in the text a work of author X is quoted or referred to; 4) Commented upon
(352 attestations): this means that a work of author X is the subject of a commentary;
5) Epitomised (422 attestations): this means that a work of author X is summarised. In
the past there was also 3) Translated, but now there is a separate entry in works for each
translation. I’m very grateful to Mark Depauw for this information about the current state
of text types in Trismegistos.

2.1 Digital Scholarship and Textual Fragments
73
Cairo.69 Given that Trismegistos collects data from other resources and the Au-
thors database is a work in progress, there are papyri associated with the name
of Hellanicus that are still missing or that are not yet imported in the author sec-
tion, and data from Jacoby Online seems not to have been completely ingested.70
In spite of that, Trismegistos is producing a fundamental resource for connecting
and aggregating databases and metadata about the ancient world through stable
identifiers and following recommendations and best practices of the Linked Open
Data (LOD) initiative.71 Considering the huge amount of data to be collected and
inserted into a complex database structure, the project is a model for establishing
a collaborative environment and an integrated network of scholars on the ancient
world.72 As far as fragmentary texts are concerned, this resource is very promis-
ing not only for publishing comprehensive digital data about physical fragments
of literary texts, but also for aggregating catalog data about fragmentary authors
and works (cf. sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2).
I.Sicily (Inscriptiones Siciliae) is a project directed by Jonathan Prag at the
University of Oxford for making freely available online the complete corpus of
inscriptions from ancient Sicily in all languages from the 7th century BC through
late antiquity.73
Inscriptions are encoded in XML according to the TEI Epi-
Doc schema and are stored in a database that can be filtered and searched in
many different ways.74 Each document has a unique identifier, as for example
ISic000298.75 Identifiers are cross-referenced with other collections like Tris-
megistos (TM), PHI Greek Inscriptions, and the Epigraphic Database Roma (EDR).
The goal of the project is to provide a new edition of every inscription with
images, a commentary, and an up to date bibliography maintained in a separate
public Zotero group library: https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445. An exam-
ple for our interests in ancient Greek fragmentary historiography is represented
69
https://www.trismegistos.org/authorwork/2177
70
An example is P.Oxy. X 1241 that is part of Trismegistos and bibliographical metadata
includes a reference to FGrHist 4 F 189, but the papyrus is not yet part of the Authors
database: https://www.trismegistos.org/text/63428. Another resource connected to
Trismegistos is the Digital Corpus of Literary Papyri (DCLP), which is building on tools and
data of the Integrating Digital Papyrology project and Papyri.info to establish a database of
literary papyri: http://www.litpap.info. Trismegistos numbers allow to obtain information
concerning literary papyrological resources about fragmentary historians. For example,
through TM 59974, it is possible to browse the DCLP and visualize the page on P.Oxy. VIII
1084, which is the papyrus with a fragment of the Atlantis of Hellanicus (see above in the
text): http://litpap.info/dclp/59974.

by five painted fragments dated between the 3rd and the 2nd century BC from
Tauromenium, which preserve traces of entries possibly belonging to a library
catalogue. The text contains bio-bibliographic information about ancient authors
who wrote in Greek: the fragmentary historians Callisthenes of Olynthus (BNJ
124), Philistos of Syracuse (BNJ 556), and Quintus Fabius Pictor (BNJ 809), an au-
thor from Elea whose name is lost and the fragmentary philosopher Anaximan-
der.76 The edition of the fragments in I.Sicily is still incomplete without images, a
physical and epigraphic description, a critical apparatus and a commentary, but
already includes bibliographic records, the current geo-location, and the date of
the autopsy of the document.77 The Greek text is based on the edition provided
by PHI and is published in three versions: interpreted, diplomatic, and download-
able TEI EpiDoc XML. The text has a corresponding identifier in Trismegistos (TM
494031), whose entry includes bibliographic records but still misses further meta-
data about the fragments and their linguistic content.78

tion of 13,000 works from 40,000 manuscripts preserved in 1,300 libraries. The re-
source is a very good starting point for obtaining information about manuscripts
and about authors and works preserved by them.
An example is Codex Palatinus Graecus 398, which is a manuscript of the
9th century from Constaninople that is part of the Bibliotheca Palatina of Hei-
delberg. The manuscript collects texts of sixteen authors including Phlegon of
Tralles and Hesychius of Miletus, who are part of the Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum and Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker.79 Pinakes has an en-
try about the manuscript with a detailed description and bibliography, and with
the list of authors and texts preserved by it which are part of a general Pinakes
catalog of ancient authors and works transmitted through manuscript tradition:
http://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/notices/cote/32479. Pinakes offers also a link to the
page of the Bibliotheca Palatina digital project with a complete description of the
manuscript, high resolution images of each page, and a stable identifier expressed
as a URN (urn:nbn:de:bsz:16–diglit–3033) (fig. 2.32).80
2.2 Textual Fragments as Hypertexts
Editions of fragmentary texts are collections of excerpts from many different
sources and are therefore representations of hypertexts.81 Figure 2.33 shows a
lost text of Istros the Callimachean quoted by Athenaeus of Naucratis that has
been extracted from the context of the Deipnosophists (on the right) and repro-
duced in a printed collection of fragments of Istros (on the left).82
As discussed in the previous sections, this is a characteristic of the print
culture that has been inherited by the first generation of digital libraries, which
have been digitizing both source texts and collections of textual fragments derived
from them (p. 55).

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
In this case, the model of the printed edition generates a static hypertext that
in a digital enviroment can be converted into a hyperlink from the fragment to
the passage of the Deipnosophists in order to help readers contextualize the reuse
of the lost text of Istros.83
Figure 2.33. Excerpting fragments: Istros F 12 Berti = Deipn. 3.74e
Printed collections of fragmentary texts contain many other hypertextual ele-
ments, as visible in figure 2.34.84 The number of the fragment (F 1) corresponds
to numbers of fragments in other collections (F 1 FGrHist; 1–2 FHG), where the
same and other source passages have been excerpted, edited, commented and

On the relationship between context and text reuse, see section 2.3. Cf. also Landow

emphasize intertextuality in a way that pagebound text in books cannot.”

classified to reconstruct the lost text of Istros.85 These correspondences are static
hyperlinks to other editions that have to be consulted for analyzing different in-
terpretations of text reuses of the same lost text.
Figure 2.34. Istros F 1 Berti
In this example the Lexicon of Photius is the source text that quotes Istros the
Callimachean (Photius [Τ 591] s.v. Τιτανίδα γῆν). This is a pure hypertext be-
cause the entry of the lexicographer, that has been extracted and reproduced in
the collection of the fragments of Istros, points to the entire lexicon of Photius
and its different editions. In figure 2.34, after the Greek text of the fragment,
there is a section that collects loci paralleli, which are other sources that preserve
a similar text reuse or discuss the same topic, and references to other lost authors
who are mentioned by Photius in the same context where appears the quotation
of Istros.86 All these parallel sources and editions are hypertextual elements de-
85
FGrHist 334 F 1 and Istros F 1 Berti publish the entry of Photius’ Lexicon ([Τ 591] s.v.
Τιτανίδα γῆν) as the main source of the fragment of Istros (in Berti the entry is complete,
while Jacoby prints only the first part of it). Müller in FHG I 418, fr. 1 publishes the same
entry of the Suda (s.v. Τιτανίδα γῆν) as the source text of the lost fragment of Istros and
cites Photius’ entry (s.v. Τιτανίδα γῆν) in the commentary to the fragment. Müller also
publishes a passage of the Collectio paroemiarum of Apostolius (XVIII 77) as the source text
of fragment 2 of the Attika of Istros, while Jacoby and Berti cite Apostolius (XVI 69) as a
locus parallelus of fragment 1. The two different citations of Apostolius depend on the use
of different editions (Jacoby and Berti used the edition by Ernst Ludwig von Leutsch, while
Müller used the edition by Daniel Heinsius).

Suda [Τ 677] s.v. Τιτανίδα γῆν (cf. [Τ 686] s.v. Τιτηνίδα γῆν); Apostol. XVI 69 (s.v. Τιτανίδα

TLG is adding some of these hyperlinks in its collection. For example, in the TLG entry of
Photius (tlg4040) there is a link to the fragment of Philochorus as published in the FGrHist.

rived from the analysis of the fragment of Istros. The last section of figure 2.34
is the apparatus criticus, that contains a critical summary of the historical tradi-
tion of the lexical entry of Photius and that generates another group of possible
hyperlinks to sources, manuscripts, and philological conjectures.87 Beyond these
elements that pertain to a single fragment, a printed edition of fragmentary texts
includes other hypertexts and potential hyperlinks in the commentaries, in the
footnotes, and in other sections at the end of the volume. Figure 2.35 is a screen-
shot from the project demo.fragmentarytexts.org that summarizes these elements
and describes them in separate web pages: 1) editing and commenting text reuse,
2) concordance tables, 3a) indexes of sources, 3b) indexes of names, and 4) bibli-
ography.88
Figure 2.35. Istros: print edition (static hypertext)
According to the definitions presented in chapter 1 and if I exclude physical frag-
ments of ancient texts, textual fragments can be described as quotations and
reuses of other texts that generate a complex multisequential and non-linear net-
work of hypertexts. As we have seen before, the first natural hypertext is between
the extracted fragment (e.g., Istros F 12 Berti) and its source text (Athen., Deipn.
3.6 = 74e). Other kinds of hypertexts are produced by parallel sources (loci paral-
leli). I have mentioned the example of Istros F 1 Berti and I can also analyze Istros
F 4 Berti.89 In this case the main source who quotes Istros the Callimachean is
87
For example: hyperlinks to the texts of the Etymologicum Magnum (s.v. Τιτανίδα γῆν)
and of the Lexicon of Hesychius ([Τ 974] s.v. Τιτανὶς γῆ), to different readings in different
manuscripts of the Suda, and to conjectures by Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and
Peter Paul Dobree.

Harpocration in his Lexicon of the Ten Attic Orators (s.v. Παναθήναια).90 The text
of Harpocration includes references to still extant sources, who are Demosthenes
and Isocrates, and to three lost authors, who are Hellanicus, Androtion, and Istros.
On the other hand, the tradition shows that the text of Harpocration was reused
by the author of the Suda ([Π 152] s.v. Παναθήναια) and probably also by Photius
in his Lexicon ([Π 376] s.v. Παναθήναια) (fig. 2.36).

“Panathenaia: Demosthenes in the Philippics (4.35). The Panathenaia held at Athens was
two-fold, one festival being held annually, and the other celebrated every five years, the
latter also called the Great Panathenaia. Isocrates in the Panathenaichus (12.17) says ‘a
short time before the Great Panathenaia.’ The first to conduct the festival was Erichthonius,
son of Hephaistos, according to the reports of Hellanicus (FHG I 54, fr. 65 = FGrHist (BNJ)
4 F 39 = FGrHist (BNJ) 323a F 2 = Ambaglio 1980 F 162) and Adrotion (FHG I 371, fr. 1
= FGrHist (BNJ) 324 F 2 = Harding 1994 F 2), both in the first book of the Atthis. Before
his time the festival was called the Athenaia, as Istros makes clear in the third book of his
Attika (FHG I 419, fr. 7 = FGrHist (BNJ) 334 F 4 = Berti 2009 F 4).” See pp. 11 and 52 ff. for
the Greek text of this entry, a commentary, and its treatment in the TLG.

80
2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
Another interesting example is Istros F 22 Berti.91 In this case we have two
different reuses of the same lost text of Istros preserved by two sources: the scho-
lion to Sophocles’ Oedipus at Colonus 1053 (Berti F 22a) and the scholion to Ly-
cophron’s Alexandra 1328 (Berti F 22b). Editors have classified the two sources
in different ways. I consider them as two parallel sources of the same fragment
of the Atakta of Istros, given that their texts are different but they both explicitly
mention Istros about the same topic (fig. 2.37).92 Jacoby prints only the text of
the scholion to Sophocles and adds the reference to the scholion to Lycophron in
parentheses as a parallel text (FGrHist 334 F 22). Müller publishes the two sources
as two different fragments of Istros’ Attika (FHG I 421, frr. 20–21).
Figure 2.38. Athen., Deipn. 5.189c = Thuc. 4.103.1
The last case I can mention is when an extant source text quotes or alludes to
another exant source text, as for example Athenaeus (Deipn. 5.189c) who quotes
Thucydides (4.103.1). This is a clear example of a hypertext that can generate
word alignments to see the differences between the two texts and how realiable
is Athenaeus in his reference (fig. 2.38).93
Fragmentary literature has the power to generate a huge amount of possi-
ble hypertexts beyond the examples presented in these pages. For our purposes, I
can classify them into two main groups: 1) hypertexts produced by extant sources
that preserve quotations and reuses of other texts, and 2) hypertexts produced by
critical editions of fragmentary texts that point to other sources, editions, com-
mentaries and reference tools. Now that source editions from which fragments
are extracted are becoming available in a digital form, it is possible to create a new
model of editions that are truly hypertextual and that include not only excerpts
but also links to scholarly sources from which those excerpts are drawn. Building
a digital corpus of fragmentary authors means addressing the problem of encod-
ing and representing both the text and the structure of a fragment.94 It is widely

The following pages collect reflections published in Berti (2015b).

2.2 Textual Fragments as Hypertexts
81
accepted that a digital representation of the internal and external characteristics
of a text consists not simply of a mere reproductive and mechanical process, but
of an interpretative act.95 Accordingly, encoding fragments is first of all the result
of interpreting them, developing a language appropriate for representing every
element of their textual features, thus creating meta-information through an ac-
curate and elaborate semantic markup. Editing fragments, therefore, signifies
producing meta-editions that are different from printed ones because they con-
sist not only of isolated quotations but also of pointers to the original contexts
from which the fragments have been extracted. While editors should be able to
define the precise chunks of text that they feel relevant and annotate these texts
in various ways (e.g., distinguishing what they consider to be paraphrase from
direct quotation), such fragments should also be dynamically linked to their orig-
inal contexts and to up-to-date contextualizing information.
On a broader level, the goal of a digital edition of fragments is to represent
multiple transtextual relationships as they are defined in literary criticism, which
include intertextuality (the presence of a text inside another text, such as quota-
tions, allusions, and plagiarism), paratextuality (i.e., all those elements which are
not part of the text, like titles, subtitles, prefaces, notes, etc.), metatextuality (criti-
cal relations among texts, such as commentaries and critical texts), architextuality
(the entire set of categories from which emerges each text), and hypertextuality
(i.e., the derivation of a text from a preexisting hypotext through a process of
transformation or imitation).96 Designing a digital edition of fragmentary texts
also means finding digital paradigms and solutions to express information about
printed critical editions and their editorial and conventional features. Working on
a digital edition means converting traditional tools and resources used by schol-
ars such as canonical references, tables of concordances, and indices into machine
actionable contents (cf. chapters 4 and 5).
In order to show some of the complex transtextual relations produced by
quotations and text reuses, I consider an example constituted by a series of frag-
mentary references embedded in a long section of the Life of Theseus by Plutarch,
which pertains to the unification of Attica and the beginning of democracy, the
annexation of the territory of Megara to Attica, the institution of the Isthmian
games, and the war against the Amazons.97

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
In these chapters Plutarch mentions many different sources: 1) three or-
acles;98 2) the text of an inscription;99 3) surviving authors, such as Aristotle,
Homer, Plutarch himself, and Pindar;100 4) a series of fragmentary historians, such
as Hellanicus, Andron of Halicarnassus, Philochorus, Pherecydes, Herodorus,
Bion, Menecrates, Clidemus, and the author of the Theseid.101
Beside these
sources, Plutarch adds also generic references to other unnamed authors as wit-
nesses of his account.102

ingly, the result of the printed representation of these fragments is that the same
text of the Life of Theseus is not only broken off in many excerpts, but also re-
peated as many times as are the authors quoted in it.104 Moreover, given that
it is not possible to clearly identify the boundaries of the quotations preserved
by Plutarch, editors have adopted different criteria for extracting them, and the
same fragment may have different lengths and divisions from one edition to an-
other.105 Digital technologies allow scholars to go beyond these limits because
standards, protocols, and tools now available permit to generate a model that can
express the hypertextual and hermeneutical nature of fragmentary texts, provid-
ing an interconnected corpus of primary and secondary sources of fragments that
also includes critical apparatuses, commentaries, translations, and modern bibli-
ography on ancient texts. The first requirement for building a digital collection
of fragmentary texts is to make the semantic contents of printed critical editions
machine readable, defining a general architecture for representing at least the
following main hypertextual elements that pertain to the domain of historical
fragmentary texts.106
1) Quotation as machine actionable link. The passage of the Life of Theseus
should be linked to the whole context of still extant sources and to editions of lost
104 On this problem for digital libraries, see p. 57.
105 Fig. 2.39 shows in blue the portion of text extracted by Müller and printed in the FHG. Fig.
2.40 shows in red a different portion of text for the same fragment extracted by Jacoby and
printed in the FGrHist. Different cut, copy, and paste methods used for the same fragment in
different editions are noticeable in the case of Philochorus (FHG I 392, fr. 49 = FGrHist 328 F
110) and Clidemus (FHG I 360, fr. 6 = FGrHist 323 F 18). There is also an example where the
same fragment of Hellanicus has two different lengths within the same collection: FGrHist
4 F 167a and FGrHist 323a F 17a. Finally Hellanicus, FHG I 55, fr. 76 partially corresponds
to four different fragments in Jacoby (FGrHist 4 F 165 = FGrHist 323a F 15 and FGrHist 4 F
166 = FGrHist 323a F 16a). For a digital and dynamic visualization of these differences, see

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
authors cited by Plutarch.107 On the other hand, editions of fragments should be
linked to the whole text of the Life of Theseus. This is the first function for a proper
representation of fragmentary texts to see each fragment directly within its con-
text of transmission and avoid the misleading idea of an independent material
existence of fragmentary texts, which derives from typographical representation
of excerpts that are actually the result of modern reconstructions of lost works.108
2) Start and end of a fragment. The next step is to provide a mechanism
for marking the beginning and the end of a fragment in its context according to
the choices of different editors. The result is that a scholar, while reading the
excerpt inside its source of transmission, is able to visualize simultaneously how
different editors have extracted different portions of text from the same context
in order to generate a fragment. As we will see in chapter 3, the ultimate goal
of a new born-digital edition of fragmentary texts is to go beyond the problem
of defining borders of text reuses and to produce what we could call borderless
fragments. This expression means that the result is not a chunk of text extracted
from the context, but a collection of annotations that mark up different elements
pertaining to a text reuse within its context of transmission.109 This function has
another important advantage in a digital library because it eliminates the problem
of the repetition of the same text inside a collection, as it happens for example in
the TLG (see pp. 57 ff.)
3) Numbering and ordering fragmentary authors and fragments. Numbering
and ordering fragmentary authors and their fragments may vary in a significant
way from one edition to another. These differences depend on the choices of the
editor, who can decide to date and classify authors and order fragments according
to different internal and external characteristics of the fragments themselves and
of their sources.110 Differences may also be the result of different fragmentations
of the same text or of the need to add new authors and texts to a collection of
fragments. My model provides the possibility of encoding this kind of informa-
tion, which is usually registered in the table of concordances of a printed edition.
Aligning multiple references to the same textual object can help readers visualize
different numberings and orderings of fragments in different editions, and the
model also permits to include new data if new editions are added.111
107 E.g., Homer and Aristotle, and Hellanicus and Philochorus in the FHG and the FGrHist.
108 On the role of the context, see section 2.3.
109 I have coined the expression borderless fragment from the concept of “borderless electronic
text” described by Landow (2006) 110–118.
110 In the FHG, Greek fragmentary historians are arranged chronologically, while in the
FGrHist they have a sequential number and are organized by genres.
Fragments are
grouped by works inside both collections: see section 1.4.
111 See section 3.2 on the use of the CITE Architecture for this purpose. See also section 4.4.3
for the digital table of concordance between the FHG and the FGrHist.

2.2 Textual Fragments as Hypertexts
85
4) Representing information about fragmentary authors and works.
The
sources that transmit fragments may include many elements that reveal the pres-
ence of the textual reuse, such as the name of a fragmentary author, the title or
the description of a fragmentary work, and other references to a fragmentary
work passage as for example the book number. Attributing a fragment to an au-
thor and a work can be a difficult task, because there are homonymous authors
and also because managing titles of ancient works can be quite challenging.112
Witnesses do not always cite work titles, and in ancient times titles were not
fixed and definitive as nowadays because they could be referred to with variants
and in the form of a description of the work content. The result is that differ-
ent editors may attribute the same fragment to different authors and works.113
The goal is to develop a comprehensive catalog with unique identifiers for every
fragmentary author and work that will include multiple expressions of the same
author and work and where each entry will have associated metadata, providing
scholars with a sort of canon that simultaneously includes all available informa-
tion on fragmentary authors and works, with pointers to primary and secondary
sources (cf. section 5.6). This function can help enhance one of the “theoretical
questions” suggested by Glenn Most when collecting fragments, which is the re-
lationship between fragmentary authors and the “shifting boundaries of canon
formation over time.”114
5) Classifying fragments. Fragmentary authors and works are classifiable
according to multiple criteria that range from internal to external factors. The
first classification is based on literary genres and subgenres that have led schol-
ars of printed editions to generate very complex categories for arranging authors
and texts within their collections (cf. sections 1.2 and 1.4). Another traditional
way of classifying fragments is distinguishing them between testimonia (i.e., frag-
ments providing biographical and bibliograpical information about fragmentary
authors) and fragmenta (i.e., actual text reuses of lost works). The printed rep-
resentation of these categories has many limitations because it is impossible to
draw a demarcation line among many different genres of fragmentary authors
and works that can be inserted in different overlapping categories. The result
again is that the same fragment is often repeated in many different sections cor-
responding to different categories.115 A digital collection in which every fragment
112 See the example of Crates of Athens and Crates of Mallus, who are both considered possible
authors of a work on Attic glosses attributed by ancient sources to a not further specified
Crates: Broggiato (2000). On titles in Greek literature see Castelli (2020).
113 See Harding (2008) 1 on the different ways in which ancient authors refer to the works of
the Atthidographers. See Berti (2009b) 6–8 on the different forms of the title of the work
on Athens of Istros the Callimachean.

phy, see Nicolai (2013) and Matijašić (2018).

2 Fragmentary Texts and the Digital Revolution
is preserved in its original context and represented with multiple pieces of meta-
data can express the complexity of modern classifications, while not scattering
and repeating the same excerpt many different times. In this way, it is possi-
ble to avoid the strictness of printed categories, allowing scholars to compare
a fragment with many other excerpts and visualizing its belonging to different
categories in a more dynamic and simultaneous way.
2.3 Cover-Text: From Fragments to Text Reuses
When 16th century humanists began to collect fragments of textual sources, the
main interest was in revealing and publishing the best traces of the most impor-
tant authors of Classical antiquity. Later scholarship established philological and
rigorous methods to find every possible evidence about lost authors, focusing
the attention on the concept of textual fragment and therefore producing big col-
lections of fragmentary authors and works, upon which we still depend for our
knowledge of otherwise unknown literary figures of ancient times.116
Recent scholarship developed during the 20th and the 21st century has been
moving the attention from the fragment to the context that preserves it. In an
important paper concerning fragmentary historiography, Guido Schepens has
coined the term cover-text to explain and define the complexity of extracting
“fragments” from their source of transmission: “[…] the methodological key-
problem the student of (historical) fragments has to face is invariably a problem
of context: either there is no context for giving (some) meaning to a detached
quotation, or only a drastically reduced context […], or there is another context:
the one of the work written by a later author in which the ‘fragment’ (how inap-
propriate is the term!) supposedly survives in some form. The latter is the way
the great majority of fragments of historical works have survived, a fact which
entails important consequences as to method. Of course, the context of the later
work must not always entail a distortion of the original meaning of a fragment,
but it often does. The student of historical fragments should be aware of the fact
that his basic working material — the texts quoted with the author’s name —
consists for the greater part of references that are made with a special purpose,
mostly in a critical or polemical spirit. We know that ancient historians, when
they wanted to take advantage of what their predecessors had written, usually
preferred an anonymous reference to one by name. As a rule they only cited
their precursor’s name when they disagreed or wanted to show off their better
knowledge. This tendency carries two important methodological implications.
116 See section 1.2.

2.3 Cover-Text: From Fragments to Text Reuses
87
First, the reference by name always needs to be examined critically before we can
think of using it as evidence for reconstructing the contents of lost works. […]
In view of the paramount importance of the analysis of the (con)text of the later
works in which the ‘fragments’ survive, one could perhaps think of calling these
works cover-texts. Apart from being a convenient short-hand, the notion ‘cover-
text’ conveys — I believe, better than the phrases commonly used (‘sources of
fragments’ or expressions like the ‘citing’ or ‘quoting’ later authors) — the conse-
quential and multiple functions these texts perform in the process of transmitting
a fragment. […] the word ‘cover’ has the triple meaning of: to conceal, protect
or enclose something. These are all activities which the later authors perform
(or can perform) when transmitting a precursor text: they, first of all, preserve (=
protect from being lost) texts drawn from works that are no longer extant; very
often, too, they more or less conceal the precursor text (for characteristics such
as the original wording and style of the precursor text are no longer discernible;
often also fragments seem to ‘hide’ in the cover-text, so that one can only guess
where a paraphrase begins or where a quotation ends); and, last but not least, the
cover-text encloses the precursor text: it is inserted or enveloped in a new con-
text, which may impose interpretations that differ considerably from the original
writer’s understanding of his text. […] Much work on Greek historiography still
fails sufficiently to take into account the full implications of the fact that in many
cases we are dependent on cover-texts. […] Second, any study of fragments
needs, if possible, to be supplemented, though under stricly limited conditions,
by an examination of the indirect tradition: such an investigation must always
take the named fragments as its starting-point, lest it end up in the speculative,
circular arguments of unwarranted Quellenforschung.”117
Guido Schepens points at two fundamental components of modern philolog-
ical methods for dealing with fragmentary texts: 1) the role of the context that
transmits information about lost texts by citing and quoting them in many differ-
ent ways, and 2) the necessity of a careful examination of the indirect tradition of
lost texts, which means a comparison between the context of the fragment and
other sources. Schepens doesn’t use the expressions text reuse and textual align-
ment, which are now key terms of many projects in the digital and computational
humanities for exploring and developing techniques of text reuse detection and
intertextual services. The goal of these services is to semi-automatically iden-
tify and represent relations and reuses of texts that include phenomena such as
quotations, allusions, paraphrases and plagiarism.
In the three following sections, I introduce new projects that have been ap-
plying text mining techniques to historical sources for text reuse detection and
intertextual alignment. The application of these techniques to historical texts is
117 Schepens (1997) 166–167. Cf. also Grafton (1997) 143 and Gorman/Gorman (2014) ch. 3.

still at the beginning and definitely needs more data and further developments.
Nevertheless, it is very interesting to see how recommendations expressed by
traditional philologists like Guido Schepens and experiments performed by digi-
tal philologists are converging into the idea of focusing the attention on primary
sources and of carefully exploring them as precious contexts of transmission of
further information about the ancient world.
2.3.1 Text Reuse Detection
In the last ten years many experiments have been carried out for applying text
reuse detection techniques to many different kinds of textual and electronic re-
sources.118 Experiments and projects are also currently in progress for applying
these techniques to historical documents.119 In this case, the detection is per-
formed for text reuses of still surviving sources where it is possible to compare
the reuse with the original text from which the reuse itself derives. As we have
seen in section 1.3, most of what was written in Classical antiquity has been lost
and now we rely on reuses of a lost textual heritage. The development of tech-
nologies for detecting reuses of lost texts has still to come and, as we will see in
the next chapters, it still requires the creation of more digital resources and the
preparation of training data.120
The Proteus Project. This is a project developed at the Center for Intelli-
gent Information Retrieval at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for build-
ing and evaluating research infrastructure for scanned books.121 The goal of the

and Basque): http://www.picapica.org.

historical sources.

project (Proteus Books) is to work with unstructured scanned book collections, as
for example the Internet Archive, and help scholars in the humanities navigate
and use them in an easier way. The project has five components: 1) language
identification, 2) duplicate detection, 3) duplicate alignment, 4) entity extraction,
and 5) quotation detection. The project has identified the language of 3,628,227
OCRed books from metadata of the Internet Archive, individuating also language
identification differences and errors.122 Proteus has then acquired the canonical
text of 803 English works and of 401 Latin works from the Perseus Digital Li-
brary, in order to compare them with English and Latin OCRed books from the
Internet Archive and find full and partial duplicates of the canonical works. After
performing duplicate detection, the OCRed text of duplicates have been aligned
with the text of canonical works to identify corresponding portions of the works.
Proteus has also performed Named Entity Recognition on 1,072,356 books from
the Internet Archive to identify people, places, organizations and things, and vi-
sualize them in a JSON format. In addition to NER, the project has been working
on finding matching quotations to see all occurrences of quotations of canonical
works in OCRed books from the Internet Archive, including commentaries and not
only copies of canonical works. An example is the Germania by Tacitus, which
is identified as urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002 in the Perseus Catalog. Proteus
allows scholars to read sections of the work and visualize portions of text that
have been identified as quotations in OCRed volumes from the Internet Archive.
The system provides an alignment between the canonical text of works and the
OCRed output with links to page images of the relevant OCRed book (fig. 2.41).123

eTRAP (Electronic Text Reuse Acquisition Project). This is a text reuse project
also with a focus on historical languages.124 The project has been developing the
TRACER machine, which is a command line engine for text reuse detection writ-
ten in Java. The goal is to semi-automatically detect text reuse between two or
multiple texts in the same language. The project provides guidelines for prepar-
ing corpora that can be analyzed with TRACER and the machine is continuously
improved thanks to the feedback gathered by tutorials and workshops organized
by eTRAP at international conferences and events.125 The project has been de-
veloping two related research works: the Digital Breadcrumbs of Brothers Grimm
and the Tracing Authorship In Noise (TrAIN) for detecting traces of the Brothers
Grimm’s tales and authorship attribution.
TRAVIz (Text Reuse Alignment Vizualization). eTRAP makes also use of
TRAVIz, which is a JavaScript library that “generates visualizations for Text Vari-
ant Graphs that show the variations between different editions of texts.”126 As
stated on the website of the project, TRAViz supports the collation task by provid-
ing methods to align various editions of a text, visualize the alignment, improve
the readability for Text Variant Graphs compared to other approaches, and inter-
act with the graph to discover how individual editions disseminate. The project
provides examples with different English and German translations of the Bible.
Text reuse detection experiments have been also carried out as part of the
project eAQUA (Extraktion von strukturiertem Wissen aus Antiken Quellen für die
Altertumswissenschaft), which was developed at the University of Leipzig for the
application of text mining methods and techniques to ancient Greek and Latin
sources.127 The first phase of the project (2008–2011) included 8 sub-projects:
1) Projekt Atthidographen, 2) Projekt Platon, 3) Projekt Metrik, 4) Projekt Camena,
5) Projekt Inschriften, 6) Projekt Papyri, 7) Projekt Fehlererkennung, and 8) Pro-
jekt Mental Maps.128 The second phase of the project (2011–2013) further applied
text mining techniques to specific research questions arising from sources related
to the Atthidographers (co-occurrences) and Plato (quotations and text reuses).
eAQUA has an online portal where it is possible to read information about the
project and access demo versions of the tools Kookkurrenz-Analyse and Zitatio-
nen. Both tools analyze data from different corpora that are free or protected by
copyright. Co-occurrences are searchable in the free corpora of the Codex Sinaiti-
cus, the Deutsches Textarchiv (DTA), Epiduke (Duke Databank of Documentary
Papyri), Herodot, PHI Latin Texts (PHI 5) and the Perseus Digital Library (Greek,

project is the access to the Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina (BTL), the Patrologia
Latina (PL/ML) and the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG CD-ROM E). The tool
Zitationen offers access to the free corpora of the PHI Latin Texts (PHI 5) and the
Perseus Digital Library (Greek and Latin), and through a limited account to the
corpus of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG CD-ROM E).
Figure 2.42. eAQUA: graph of Ἀτθίδος
As far as lost authors are concerned, eAQUA has published experimental results
on the Atthidographers, which is an expression alluding to a literary genre that
includes a group of ancient Greek local historians who wrote about Athens and
Attica but whose works are now lost.130
An example is the use of the term Ἀτθίδος, which is the genitive of the
adjective Ἀτθίς used as a title of histories of Attica written by the Atthidogra-
phers: ἡἈτθίς (συγγραφή) (Atthis and plural Atthides).131 eAQUA has analyzed
co-occurences of Ἀτθίδος in the TLG (CD-ROM E) and has produced visualiza-
tions through graphs, revealing in this way interesting connections about the
use of this work title in ancient Greek literature.132 The online tool Kookkurrenz-
Analyse allows to search and visualize lists of co-occurrences of ancient Greek
words, including Ἀτθίδος on which are based the results presented by Schubert

(2011).133 Other experiments in eAQUA have been performed using the Citation-
Graph to visualize sources preserving quotations and text reuses of the lost works
of the Atthidographers.134
Figure 2.44 shows an example of visualization of the sources that preserve
text reuses of the lost work of the Atthidographer Demon. Charlotte Schubert has
also experimented with text reuses of Clidemus. The CitationGraph doesn’t re-
veal new fragments of the lost Atthidographer, but allows to visualize the reuses
of his lost works with a perspective not dependent on the editorial selections
and arrangements of scholars who have published editions of Clidemus’ frag-
ments.135 These tools still need further developments and the ingestion of other
digital sources to produce more results and try to obtain previosuly unexplored
relations among texts.136 In any case, they already offer a first set of experimen-
tal functions and visualization possibilities that allow scholars to go beyond the
limits of traditional printed editions where the selection and the presentation of
source texts of fragmentary authors strongly depend on the decisions of the edi-
tor.137
Trismegistos (reuse of texts). A special and in some way related case of “reuse
of texts” is presented by the project Trismegistos.138 This case concerns physical
documents and the reuse of papyri, stones and other materials as writing surfaces,
which was a very common practice in antiquity. Text reuse is not the focus of
Trismegistos, but its team has been starting to devote a section of the project with
different categories for specifying if there is a relation among texts written on the
same physical objects.139 Even if strictly related to the material reuse of writing
objects, this tool has the possibility to expand and reveal relations among ancient

136 For example, the project still includes the texts of the CD-ROM version E of the TLG,
which is now superseded by the online version that constantly adds new sources to the

the lost author Ephippus of Olynthus and Nicobule: Pfeil (2013). Other results in eAQUA
have been published for detecting quotations in still extant sources, like Plutarch and Plato:
Schubert (2010b); Schubert/Klank (2012); Schubert (2017); Geßner (2010). As far as the
reception of Plato in antiquity is concerned, further research is now developed as part

139 There are many different cases where texts could be written on an object because related
or not related to the text already written on it. Trismegistos provides an experimental
search engine for exploring “sets of texts connected with reuse.” Interesting examples are
documents that were joined in a second stage for their users’ convenience and because of
their complementary contents. In this cases Trismegistos provides specific categories for
these types of connection.

texts generating further search criteria and types of reuse with the addition of
new records and the collaboration with other projects.
2.3.2 Intertextual Analysis
Strictly connected to text reuse is the concept of intertextuality, which aims at
exploring the intricate structure of meaningful relationships between texts. As
for Classical sources, the theory of intertextuality was originally developed in
the field of Latin literature, but is now expading to cover other genres as for ex-
ample Greek historiography.140 Digital philologists have been recently explored
methodologies for digitally representing intertextuality and for training and test-
ing the machine to automatically detect intertextual matches between historical
texts.141 Taking into consideration the complexity of historical sources and the
lack of complete and fully comprehensive digital corpora, a lot of work has still
to be done in order to prepare data and get proper results from it. Nevertheless,
the tools that I present in this section are already generating interesting results
that could be expanded with more data and a bigger involvement of the scholarly
community.
Tesserae. Tesserae is a collaborative project of the Departments of Classics
and Linguistics of the University at Buffalo, the Department of Computer Science
and Engineering of the University of Notre Dame, and the Département des Sci-
ences de l’Antiquité of the University of Geneva.142 The project offers a free and
open web interface for exploring intertextual parallels and detecting allusions in
Latin poetry by generating lists of lines that share two or more words within
a single line or phrase regardless of inflectional changes.143 Tesserae makes use
of corpora from different databases, such as The Latin Library, the Perseus Digi-
140 Berti (2012) 442–446 with bibliography; Coffee/Koenig et al. (2012) 383–384; Coffee (2018).
On the application of intertextual concepts to Classical historiography, see the papers on
Allusion and Intertextuality in Classical Historiography presented at the APA Annual Meet-
ing in San Antonio (Jan. 8, 2011), and on Historiography, Poetry, and the Intertext and
Intertextual Relationships Between Poetry, Prose and Historiography presented at the APA
Annual Meeting in Seattle (Jan. 4, 2013) and at the CA Annual Conference in Reading (Apr.
6, 2013). These papers are available online on the website of Histos. The On-line Journal of
Ancient Historiography. On intratextuality, which is the interaction between parts of the
same text or body of texts within a single author, see Harrison/Frangoulidis et al. (2018).
141 On how hypertext is “a fundamentally intertextual system,” see Landow (2006) 55.

3 is currently updated to continue its functionality. Examples in this book are taken from
version 3.

tal Library, DigilibLT (Digital library of late-antique Latin texts), the Open Greek
and Latin project, Musisque Deoque, and the Corpus Scriptorum Latinorum.144 As
of 2021, the project allows to begin testing with Greek and English texts, and
offers other experimental tools: Latin Multi-Text Search (cross-references dis-
covered parallels against the rest of the Latin corpus), Greek Multi-Text Search
(cross-references discovered parallels against the rest of the Greek corpus), LSA
Search Tool (search for thematic similarities even where phrases have no words in
common), Tri-gram visualizer (customizable, color-coded visualization of 3-gram
concentrations), Full-text display (displays the full text of the poems with refer-
ences highlighted in red), and Lucan-Vergil benchmark test (perform a search of
Lucan’s Pharsalia Book 1 against Vergil’s Aeneid, and compares the results against
a 3000-parallel benchmark set).
Figure 2.45. Tesserae: comparison of Catullus’ Carmina with Vergil’s Aeneid book 1
Figure 2.45 shows the example of a comparison between Catullus’ Carmina and
the first book of the Aeneid of Vergil. The search generates 737 results and in each
case displays two common words between the target text (alluding text: Vergil)
and the source text (alluded-to text: Catullus). Advanced search options allow
users to set different parameters such as units to be compared (lines or phrases),
features to be matched across texts (exact word, lemma, semantic match, lemma
+ semantic match, and sound), number of stop words and the stoplist basis to

orthography, and by removing all punctuation and capitalization.

determine frequencies for the stoplist, score and frequency basis for getting rarer
words closer together, and maximum distance and distance metric to exclude
matching words that are too far from each other. Results allow to visualize high-
lighted matching words, to re-sort results with sort options, to read both target
and source texts in their entire context, and to export data in CSV, TSV, and XML
formats. Regarding Latin poetry, the automatic detection of parallel phrases in
Tesserae is producing promising results. As reported by the team of the project,
it “recovers approximately a third of the parallels captured by traditional com-
mentators, and adds a third not previously recorded.”145 As far as prose texts and
Greek sources are concerned, the tool allows users to explore intertextual paral-
lels and obtain many results that need to be further selected and verified in order
to test the effectiveness of the algorithms.
TLG Intertextual Phrase Matching. As part of new features offered by the
online version of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG), there is also a tool for in-
tertextual phrase matching. The service is based on n-gram comparison (bigrams
and trigrams) for detecting sequences of two or three content words shared be-
tween two texts in order to identify common text passages.146 N-grams are used
in the TLG for 1) comparing two texts or two authors side by side (N-Grams), 2)
for seeing attestations of phrases in the corpus (Browse – Browse one text), and 3)
for selecting two passages and viewing their similarities (Browse – Parallel brows-
ing).147
A first example is a comparison between the Historiae of Thucydides (ed.
Jones-Powell: tlg0003.001) and all texts of Athenaeus of Naucratis (tlg0008).148
Figure 2.46 shows 8 results, 6 of which have as a target text the Deipnosophists
and 2 the epitome. As for the Deipnosophists, there are matches in books 5, 9, 10
and 11. Passages in books 5 and 11 have been also detected in printed editions
of the Deipnosophists by August Meineke, Georg Kaibel, and Douglas Olson.149
Passages in books 9 and 10 are not referred to in printed editions and seem not to
be relevant.150 As for the epitome, only the passage from the summary of book 11
of the Deipnosophists is pertinent.151 Missing are a direct quotation of a passage
145 Coffee/Koenig et al. (2012) 386.
146 The comparison is based on lemmata and the order of words within n-grams is ignored.
Stop-words that don’t contribute to the meaning of the comparison are removed.
147 Descriptions of these tools are available on the TLG website. For a recent review of the
TLG intertextual phrase matching, see Boogert (2019).
148 The texts of Athenaeus in the TLG are constituted by the Deipnosophists (ed. Kaibel:
tlg0008.001), one fragment of On the kings of Syria (FGrHist 166 F 1: tlg0008.002), and
the epitome of the Deipnosophists (ed. Peppink: tlg0008.003).
149 Ath., Deipn. 5.55 = 215f and 216a = Thuc. 4.96.5, 8; Deipn. 11.57 = 478f = Thuc. 7.87.2. The
passage in book 11 is one, but the TLG has chopped it up into two consecutive matches
because it is an extended passage.
150 Ath., Deipn. 9.29 = 383a = Thuc. 4.50.2; Deipn. 10.87 = 458a = Thuc. 5.111.4.
151 Ath., Epit. 2.2.58.10 Peppink = Thuc. 7.87.2.

from Thucydides and of course direct references to his name without quotations
or paraphrases of his text.152
Figure 2.46. TLG intertextual phrase matching: comparison of Thucydides with Athenaeus
Concerning lost texts, we can try to compare the fragments of Istros the Cal-
limachean (tlg1450) with Athenaeus of Naucratis (tlg0008).153 In this case, we
obtain 19 results (partial screenshot in fig. 2.47). Considering that passages are
chopped up into consecutive matches, the actual detected fragments are four from
the Deipnosophists and the epitome (frr. 14, 35, 38, 43) and they correspond to all
those published in the FHG. In this case, the intertextual phrase matching is use-
ful to align the lost text of the fragments as they were edited by Karl Müller in
the FHG and the original text of the Deipnosphists in the edition by Kaibel and of
the epitome in the edition by Peppink.
Through the TLG Parallel browsing it is also possible to select one fragment
of Istros and compare its text in the edition of the FHG with the whole context
of the passage of the Deipnosophists in the edition by Kaibel (e.g., fr. 14 in fig.
2.48). As part of the comparing functions, the TLG now offers also the possibility
152 Ath., Deipn. 1.42 = 23b = Thuc. 1.70.5 (the quoted passage is νικώμενοι ἐπ’ ἐλάχιστον
ἀναπίπτουσιν, which is detected in the text of the Deipnosophists when enabling n-grams
in the Browse one text section of the TLG); Deipn. 3.73 = 108f = Thuc. 7.33.4; Deipn. 5.15 =
189c = Thuc. 4.103.1; Deipn. 5.55 = 215d = Thuc. 5.2.1.
153 Istros’ fragments in the TLG are from Müller’s FHG (tlg1450.004) and from Mette (1978)
(tlg1450.003).

to compare two editions of the same text. In this case the TLG uses differences
between individual word forms, beta escapes, and punctuation in order to capture
finer distinctions between texts than with n-grams. The TLG provides the current
available list of texts with multiple editions with the goal of expanding it over
time.
2.3.3 Translation Alignment
Text reuses and intertextual parallels can be analyzed and detected also across
different languages. Figure 2.49 shows a passage of Livy (30.45), who explicitly
refers to Polybius (16.23) about the presence of the king Syphax in the triumphal
march of Scipio to Rome. Given that the Greek text of Polybius is preserved,
it is possible to compare it with its Latin reuse and generate an alignment of
the corresponding words.154 Many other examples are also offered in the field of
fragmentary literature, were original texts are lost. Figure 2.50 shows a passage of
the Astronomica of the Latin polymath Hyginus (2.40) mentioning the lost Greek
author Istros the Callimachean about Koronis (FGrHist 334 F 66 = BNJ 334 F 66).
Given that we don’t have the original text, it is not possible to check the accuracy
of the reference of Hyginus, except for speculating about the words that could
possibly derive from Istros’ work, whose name is the only evidence in the passage
of Hyginus.
Machine translation tools have been developed for “automatically producing
in a target language the translation of a text in a source language.” These tools are
devised for translations of everyday texts written in modern languages and not for
literature or poetry. Results are still not really satisfactory because translation is a
very difficult task that requires a profound knowledge and comprehension of the
text that has to be translated, and because machines still need a lot of training.155
154 Corresponding words are red in the figure. The page is available at http://demo.fragmen
tarytexts.org/en/istros/digital-edition/digital-edition-exploring-text-re-uses-across-lang
uages.html, where it is also available an XML output of the alignment produced with the
translation alignment editor of the Alpheios project.

World War, see Poibeau (2017). For an overview of the revolutionary effects that online
translation services and crowdsourced translations are producing and for their implications
for human languages, cultures and society, see Cronin (2013).

Figure 2.50. Text reuse of lost texts across languages (Hyginus cites Istros)
Translation of historical texts is an even more difficult task, because it is about
texts produced in the past and problems of comprehension are much bigger than
for modern and contemporary texts, and also because it is very difficult to agree
on what we mean by translation and by good translation. This is one of the rea-
sons why we still miss automatically generated translations of historical texts and
experiments are at the very beginning.156
Tesserae has been implementing a Greek-Latin search, which is available
online for testing results, and is producing a translation dictionary for linking
Greek lemmata to associated Latin terms.157 A similar method has been used as
part of the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) project in order to
align the Greek text of the fragments with their Latin translation provided by the
editor Karl Müller. This case is different from those mentioned before, because
it is not about two ancient languages, but about the translation of ancient Greek
into 19th century scholarly Latin. The method was based on the use of data from
the Dynamic Lexicon, which is a project of the Perseus Digital Library for creating
automatic bilingual dictionaries of Greek-English and Latin-English, using source
156 Bamman/Crane (2009); Crane (2019).

texts in Greek or Latin aligned with their English translations and using also
morpho-syntactic data from Greek and Latin treebank.158
Another method has been explored by combining data of the Dynamic Lexi-
con with data of the Ancient Greek WordNet (AGWN), which is a project of the In-
stitute for Computational Linguistics “A. Zampolli” in Pisa for producing a lexico-
semantic resource mapped on Princeton WordNet 3.0.159 Both approaches have
produced translation pairs that are not completely correct because they still need
accuracy improvement and manual validation, but they have shown that they can
be integrated in order to improve performances. One of the problems that clearly
emerges from these experiments is the lack of training data and the necessity of
producing it in order to expand dictionaries of historical languages that can be
used for increasing machine translation results.
Having this goal in mind, translation alignment tools have been developed
in the last years, such as the translation alignment editor of the Alpheios project
and Ugarit iAligner of the Open Philology project at the University of Leipzig.
The first editor is part of a set of reading and learning environments developed
by Alpheios to support worldwide study of classical languages and literatures.
The tool has been experimentally used for research and teaching initiatives and
as part of the Perseids project at Tufts University, allowing users to manually align
two texts in two different languages including Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Egyptian,
Persian, and Syriac.160 Ugarit iAligner is a tool that performs automatic syntax-
based intra-language alignment and automatic alignment of different versions of
a text using a modified version of the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm. It includes
an editor for manual alignment of up to three languages.161

dissertation written by Yousef (2015) under my supervision at the University of Leipzig.

periments have been also performed as part of the Sunoikisis Digital Classics program:

ing Persian poetry with modern languages and as part of the Digital Rosetta Stone project
(section 4.6) for aligning the Hieroglyphic, Demotic, and Greek scripts of the inscription.

3 Distributed Annotations of Fragmentary
Texts
This chapter is devoted to distributed annotations of fragmentary texts in a
digital environment. The first section (3.1) shows and explains the new idea
of conceiving fragmentary texts as annotations of textual elements about
reused authors and works. The second section (3.2) describes the CITE Ar-
chitecture, which is a protocol for producing canonical citations, and its ap-
plication to text reuse. The third section (3.3) describes an experiment de-
veloped by the Perseus Project for implementing a fragmentary texts editor.
3.1 Annotations of Reused Authors and Works
One of the main concerns when raising evidence of lost works is to reconstruct the
complex relationship between the fragment and its source of transmission. This
means weighing the level of interference played by the author who has reused
and transformed the original context of the fragment — measuring the distance
between the source text and the derived text — and trying to perceive the degree
of text reuse and its effects on the resulting target text.1 This interpretative pro-
cess is usually explained in the commentary of an edition of fragmentary texts or
in papers and monographs pertaining to various aspects of fragmentary authors
and works, but is completely lost in the printed representation of the fragments,
which are simply typographical reproductions of extracts of derived texts.2
As I described in section 2.2, textual fragments are a form of hypertext. In
this respect, a digital environment offers the possibility to represent fragments
as text reuses within their context of transmission, pointing directly to the ele-
ments that are traces of a text reuse and going beyond the problem of extract-
ing and decontextualizing extended chunks of texts that preserve quotations and
reuses of other texts.3 A straightforward example is a quotation of the lost author
Hecataeus of Miletus by Athenaeus of Naucratis in the Deipnosphists:

See section 1.4.

which is a “borderless electronic text,” see Landow (2006) 112–118.

Deipn. 10.67 = 447c: ῾Εκαταῖος δ᾽ἐν δευτέρῳΠεριηγήσεως εἰπὼν
περὶΑἰγυπτίων ὡς ἀρτοφάγοι εἰσὶν ἐπιφέρει· τὰς κριθὰς ἐς τὸπῶμα
καταλέουσιν. ἐν δὲτῇτῆς Εὐρώπης ΠεριόδῳΠαίονάς φησι πίνειν
βρῦτον ἀπὸτῶν κριθῶν καὶπαραβίην ἀπὸκέγχρου καὶκονύζης·
ἀλείφονται δέ, φησίν, ἐλαίῳἀπὸγάλακτος. καὶταῦτα μὲν ταύτῃ.4
In this passage the Naucratites quotes two works of Hecataeus that are now lost
and adds a few pieces of information about the source texts: The name of the
fragmentary author (῾Εκαταῖος), the titles of two fragmentary works (Περιήγησις
and τῆς Εὐρώπης Περίοδος) with book number (δεύτερος) in the first case, and
different text reuses, which are introduced by verba dicendi (εἰπών, ἐπιφέρει, φησι
and φησίν) and seem to be partly paraphrases or summaries and partly verbatim
repetitions of the original words of the lost works. This passage is usually split
into two different chunks of text corresponding to two fragments of Hecataeus:
see FHG I 8 fr. 123 and 20 fr. 290; FGrHist 1 FF 154 and 323a; BNJ 1 FF 154 and
323a.
If the concept of hypertext is nowadays taken for granted and if the annota-
tions of the elements shown above seems to be an easy process, in fact a proper
representation of all the components belonging to the domain of historical text
reuse requires a complex infrastructure with layers of annotations and tagsets.5
These annotations include not only the portion of text that can be considered a
reuse, but also many pieces of information like names and geographic provenance
of reused authors with variants, titles and/or descriptions of reused works, verba
dicendi, expressions of literary criticism, and other linguistic and morphosyntac-
tic features.
Building a digital library of text reuses of fragmentary authors means, first
of all, to select the string of words that belong to the portion of text which is
classifiable as a reuse and, secondly, to encode all those elements that signal the
presence of the text reuse itself (named entities, grammar, syntax, etc.).
The next step is to align and encode all information pertaining to other wit-
nesses that reuse the same original text with different words and a different syn-
tax, parallel texts that deal with the same topic of the text reuse, and finally dif-
ferent editions and translations of both the source and the derived texts.6

“Hecataeus in the Book II of the Tour reports that the Egyptians eat bread, and then contin-
ues: They grind up barley to produce the substance they drink. And in his Journey through
Europe he says that the Paeonians drink brutos made from barley, and parabiē made from
millet and fleabane; and they smear themselves, he claims, with oil made from milk. So
much for these topics.” Trans. by Olson (2006–2012).

3.2 The CITE Architecture

3.2 The CITE Architecture
Before addressing methods and strategies for annotating historical fragmentary
texts, it is necessary to introduce the CITE Architecture, which is a framework
for producing machine actionable citations of texts including quotations and text
reuses of extant and lost sources. CITE is a digital library architecture that stands
for “Collections, Indices, Texts, and Extensions.”7 This architecture was origi-
nally developed for the Homer Multitext (HMT), which is a project of the Har-
vard’s Center for Hellenic Studies to digitally represent language, structure, and
manuscript tradition of Greek epic poetry.8 The goal of the architecture is to pro-
vide a framework for identifying and retrieving machine actionable citations of
texts and other data that are the basis of scholarly publications in the humanities.9
The architecture makes use of the international standard of “Uniform Resource
Names” (URNs). This standard allows to make unique, complete, precise, and
machine actionable scholarly citations. Given that URNs can be hierarchical, the
architecture gives the possibility to cite at different levels of granularity.10
The architecture is based on two main data models: 1) the standard CTS URN
for identifying and retrieving texts and passages of texts, and 2) the standard CITE
URN for identifying and retrieving discrete objects and other data (e.g., manuscript
folios, images, syntactic structure, metrical feet, text reuse, etc.).11 The CTS URN
is based on the assumption that a text can be modelled as “an ordered hierarchy
of citation objects” (OHCO2) and defines “a citable text as a set of citable nodes”
that belong to a bibliographic hierarchy and to a citation hierarchy, and that are
ordered.12 Implementations of the CTS URN have been developed by different
projects, such as the Perseus Digital Library, Open Greek and Latin, the First 1000
Years of Greek, the Scaife Viewer, the Canonical Text Service of the University of
Leipzig and CapiTainS.13 An example of a scholarly citation that can be digitally
represented is “Homer, Iliad, edition of Wolf (1804), Book 1, line 1.” This citation
refers to the first line of the Iliad of Homer in the 1804 edition by Friedrich August

CTS stands for “Canonical Text Services.”
12
The acronym OHCO derives from DeRose/Durand et al. (1990), who argued that a text is
an “ordered hierarchy of content objects.” In Renear/Mylonas et al. (1996), the authors
thought again their model and recognized that there are overlapping hierarchies when
taking different perspectives on the content of a text. Smith/Weaver (2009) observed that a
better functional definition of text has the “citation object” as its fundamental unit, and so
proposed OHCO2. CTS is built on this definition. See Smith/Blackwell (2012), Blackwell/
Smith (2016) 3, and Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016) 124.

Wolf and is valid both if a scholar reads a printed text of the book or a digital
version of it in Google Books, Internet Archive, or HathiTrust:
Μῆνιν ἄειδε, θεά, Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος,
According to the CITE Architecture, it is possible to convert this citation into a
machine actionable format:
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.wolf1:1.1
This CTS URN represents different levels of the citation:
The CTS domain
(urn:cts:) which is required in the URN syntax, the namespace greekLit that
identifies works in ancient Greek, and a hierarchy that identifies the work and
the edition of the work. In this case the hierarchy is analogous to that of the
Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR).14 Within this hierar-
chy, texts exist in a text-group (in this case the Homeric poetry) and a text-group
contains one or more works (in this case the Iliad). Identifiers include numbers
of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG), where Homer is tlg0012 and the Iliad
is tlg001.15 wolf1 is a reference to the 1804 edition of the Iliad by the German
scholar Friedrich August Wolf. After the colon, 1.1 refers to book 1, line 1. It is
also possible to expand the citation to ranges of passages (e.g., 1.1–1.2) and add
a substring to cite a word of the text (e.g., 1.1@μῆνιν[1]).
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001 is the work-level identifier, where the Il-
iad is considered as an abstraction (notional work) that includes every edition
and translation of the work.
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.wolf1 is the “version-level” identifier (in
this case the 1804 printed edition of the Iliad by Wolf).
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.wolf1:1.1@μῆνιν[1] is the passage com-
ponent that also points to words (in this case the first occurrence of the string
μῆνιν in book 1, line 1 of the edition of the Iliad by Wolf).
The CITE component of the architecture allows to identify and retrieve
citations of discrete objects and other data like physical manuscript folios of
the Homer Multitext project.16 For example, urn:cite:hmt:msA.msA–12r uniquely
identifies a single object in the Homer Multitext collection, which is folio 12 recto
of the Venetus A manuscript. The CITE Architecture offers also the possibility
to cite other data, such as lexical tokens, metrical feet, syntax, and fragmentary
texts.17 As I described in chapter 1, there are two main kinds of fragmentary texts:
fragmentary texts of still extant works and fragmentary texts of lost works. The first
kind of fragmentary text is citable as an alignment of CTS URNs. Following the
examples described in chapter 1 (p. 10), the reuse of a passage of the Histories

of Herodotus (6.127.1) in the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus (12.58 = 541bc) can be
documented as:
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:12.58@ἀπὸ[1]–12.58@ἀφίκετο[1]
quotes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg002:6.127.1@ἀπὸ[1]–6.127.1@ἀπίκετο[1]
This alignment means that the string ἀπὸμὲν Ἰταλίης Σμινδυρίδης ὁἹπποκρά-
τεος Συβαρίτης, ὃς ἐπὶπλεῖστον δὴχλιδῆς εἷς ἀνὴρ ἀφίκετο of Ath., Deipn. 12.58
is a quotation of the string ἀπὸμὲν δὴἸταλίης ἦλθε Σμινδυρίδης ὁἹπποκράτεος
Συβαρίτης, ὃς ἐπὶπλεῖστον δὴχλιδῆς εἷς ἀνὴρ ἀπίκετο of Hdt. 6.127.1.18
The second kind of fragmentary text (lost text) is citable as an alignment of
CTS and CITE URNs. For example, Ath., Deipn. 3.6 (= 74e) is the only citable evi-
dence of a passage of the work of Istros the Callimachean that is now lost: Ἴστρος
δ' ἐν τοῖς Ἀττικοῖς οὐδ' ἐξάγεσθαί φησι τῆς Ἀττικῆς τὰς ἀπ' αὐτῶν γινομένας
ἰσχάδας, ἵνα μόνοι ἀπολαύοιεν οἱκατοικοῦντες· καὶἐπεὶπολλοὶἐνεφανίζοντο
διακλέπτοντες, οἱτούτους μηνύοντες τοῖς δικασταῖς ἐκλήθησαν τότε πρῶτον συ-
κοφάνται.19 In this case the text of the Deipnosophists can’t be aligned with any
other texts because the original work of Istros is lost. Moreover, in order to avoid
the duplication of the text of Athenaeus by extracting from it the chunk of text
with the reuse of Istros (as it happens in printed collections of fragmentary texts),
the CITE Architecture offers the possibility to represent the reuse within the text
of Athenaeus:
urn:cite:lofts:berti.istros12
quotes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:3.6@Ἴστρος[1]–3.6@συκοφάνται[1]
This alignment means that a passage of Ath., Deipn. 3.6 has been quoted and clas-
sified as fragment 12 (istros12) of Istros the Callimachean in the critical edition
of the scholar Berti.20 The CITE URN represents the level of the edition, while the
CTS URN represents a string of text that is cited for specific purposes. The CITE
Architecture allows different editors to cite and classify strings of text in differ-
ent ways. For example, the same or a shorter or longer string of text referring
to Istros in Ath., Deipn. 3.6 could be cited and classified by different editors and
with different numbers in different editions of the fragmentary author Istros.
CITE URNs can be used for many other kinds of citable analyses within the
domain of fragmentary literature. In this case the data model developed by the

3 Distributed Annotations of Fragmentary Texts
CITE Architecture has been experimented with the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus
of Naucratis and specifies five subjects of analyses with properties:21
1. Authors (properties)
– EntityUrn: a CITE URN that uniquely identifies a reused author. An example
is urn:cite:digAth:authors.auth3 that identifies “Archilochus” and is unique
for all occurrences of his name in the Deipnosophists.22
– CtsUrn: a CTS URN that identifies a passage where the author is mentioned.
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:1.2@Ἀρχίλοχον[1] is one of the passages
of the Deipnosophists where Archilochus is mentioned. This passage serves
to justify the author’s inclusion in the list.23 When an author is reused often,
the passage here should be a clear, unambiguous reference (e.g., “Homer says
[…]”).
– Label: a human-readable name for the author. E.g., “Archilochus of Paros.”
– OptionalCtsGroupUrn: a group-level CTS URN that identifies still extant au-
thors. E.g., urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012: (Homer).
2. Works (properties)
– EntityUrn: a CITE URN that uniquely identifies a reused work. For example,
urn:cite:digAth:works.work1 identifies the gastronomic work by Archestra-
tus of Syracuse or Gela.24
– AuthorUrn: a CITE URN that uniquely identifies a reused author and corre-
sponds to an author cataloged in Authors. urn:cite:digAth:authors.auth20
identifies Archestratus of Syracuse or Gela, who was the author of a gas-
tronomic work.
Athenaeus writes that Archestratus was from Syracuse
21
The Deipnosophists is a work full of many different kinds of quotations and reuses of other
texts and this is the reason why it fits well with experiments for producing annotations of
fragmentary texts in their context. On the Digital Athenaeus project and on the content of
the Deipnosophists, see chapter 5. The data model of the CITE Architecture has been devel-
oped in collaboration with D. Neel Smith and Christopher W. Blackwell and was presented
at the international conference Digital Humanities 2016: see Berti/Daniels et al. (2016) and
Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016) (texts and examples mentioned in the following pages are taken
from these papers).
22
In the syntax of the CITE URN, auth3 represents a sequence number in an ordered col-
lection. Each item has a sequence number that reflects the item’s sequence in the text of
the Deipnosophists. This value is programmatically generated by a CTS-aware script be-
fore publication of the collection: Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016). Given that text reuses in
the same text can be identified and cited in different ways by different scholars, sequence
numbers may differ in different collections. Examples provided here do not correspond to a
complete analysis of the Deipnosophists, but to a first theoretical experiment with the text
of Athenaeus.
23
This example is interesting because the citation of Archilochus is part of a passage of the
Deipnosophists that mentions “Archilochus’ successors” (τῶν μετ᾿Ἀρχίλοχον ποιητῶν) and
therefore includes two references: one to Archilochus and the other to the poets who came
after him. The CITE Architecture allows to represent both references with different citable
analyses of the same text.
24
For the syntax of the CITE URN that includes a sequence number for the items in the
collection, see n. 22.

3.2 The CITE Architecture
109
or Gela (Ἀρχέστρατος ὁΣυρακούσιος ἢΓελῷος).
Like for ancient ti-
tles (see n. 26), also places of origin of ancient authors are often uncer-
tain and sources reflect these uncertainties. The CITE Architecture allows
to cite the two traditions about the ethnic origin of Archestratus by gen-
erating two citable analyses that can be aligned to the same CITE URN
that identifies the author (see below the subject Mentions). In this case
the EntityURN urn:cite:digAth:authors.auth20 will correspond to the Ct-
sUrn urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:1.7@Ἀρχέστρατος[1]–1.7@Γελῷος[1],
whose textual content corresponds to both Ἀρχέστρατος ὁΣυρακούσιος and
Ἀρχέστρατος ὁΓελῷος.25
– CtsUrn: a CTS URN that identifies a passage in Athenaeus where the work is
mentioned. E.g., urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:1.7@ὅτι[1]–1.7@φησί[1]
identifies the passage of the Deipnosophists where the gastronomic work of
Archestratus is mentioned.26 This passage serves to justify the work’s inclu-
sion in the list. When a work is reused often, the passage here should be a
clear, unambiguous reference (e.g., “Eupolis says, in the Demoi […]”).
– Label: a human-readable name for the work. E.g., “Demoi.”
– OptionalCtsWorkUrn: a work-level CTS URN that identifies still extant works.
E.g., urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001: (Iliad).27
3. Characters (properties)
– EntityUrn: a CITE URN that uniquely identifies sophists (characters) who take
part in the banquet described by Athenaeus in the Deipnosphists.28 For exam-
ple, urn:cite:digAth:characters:character1 identifies Aemilianus Maurus.
– CtsUrn: a CTS URN that identifies a passage in Athenaeus where the character
is mentioned. urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:3.25@Αἰμιλιανὸς[1] is an
example of one of the passages of the Deipnosophists where Aemilianus is
mentioned and talks. This passage serves to justify the character’s inclusion
in the list; when a character is reused often, the passage here should be a clear,
unambiguous reference (e.g., “Ulpianus says […]”).
– Label: a human-readable name for the character. E.g., “Aemilianus Maurus.”
– OptionalCtsGroupUrn: for characters who were authors and whose texts are
25
For the annotation of this example with INCEpTION, see section 5.6.3.
26
The work of Archestratus is one of the many examples of ancient Greek literature with
different titles in the tradition. In the passage of the Deipnosophists cited here (1.7 = 4e)
Athenaeus testifies that this work was entitled Gastronomy (Γαστρονομία) according to
Chrysippus, Life of pleasure (Ἡδυπάθεια) according to Lynceus and Callimachus, Science
of dining (Δειπνολογία) according to Clearchus, and Art of cooking (Ὀψοποιία) according to
others. The CITE Architecture allows to cite all these four titles and align them to a unique
identifier that represents them, because they are different expressions of the same work.
27
An interesting example are names for specific books of the Iliad, which can have more pre-
cise CTS URNs in the OptionalCtsWorkUrn field: e.g., urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:18
= Making of arms (Ὁπλοποιία), which is the name of the eighteenth book of the Iliad.
28
This is a specific subject of analysis for the Deipnosophists, where the author describes a
group of twenty-two learned men (sophists) who take part in the banquet described in the
book and who cite many texts of ancient literature: see section 5.5.3.

110
3 Distributed Annotations of Fragmentary Texts
still extant, a group-level CTS URN that identifies the character. For example,
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0057: (Galenus of Pergamum).
4. Mentions (properties)
– EntityUrn: a CITE URN that uniquely identifies a reference in the text of
the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus. E.g., urn:cite:digAth:mentions.1 identifies
Archestratus of Syracuse.29
– CiteUrn: a CITE URN (from Authors or Works above) that identifies the
author or work mentioned in Athenaeus. urn:cite:digAth:authors.auth20
identifies Archestratus in the list of Authors.30
– CtsUrn: a CTS URN that specifies a passage in Athenaeus that mentions
the
author
like
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:1.7@Ἀρχέστρατος[1]–
1.7@Γελῷος[1].31
– Text: the relevant textual content of the passage specified by the CTS URN
(above). E.g., Ἀρχέστρατος ὁΣυρακούσιος.
– Notes: human-readable notes. May be empty.
5. Reuses (properties)
– EntityUrn: a CITE URN that uniquely identifies an instance of text reuse in the
Deipnosophists of Athenaeus. For example, urn:cite:digAth:reuse.1 identi-
fies a reuse of a lost verse of Eratosthenes of Cyrene.
– CiteUrn: a CITE URN (from Authors or Works above) that identifies the
author or work mentioned in Athenaeus. urn:cite:digAth:authors.auth13
identifies Eratosthenes of Cyrene.32
– CtsUrn:
a CTS URN that specifies a passage in Athenaeus con-
taining the text reuse.
This should be a range that includes lan-
guage marking the passage as text reuse (verbum dicendi, etc.).
E.g.,
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:1.3@τρὶς[1]–1.3@ἄμεινον[1] is the pas-
sage with the verse of Eratosthenes.33
– TextContent:
a string that contains the precise textual content (from
Athenaeus) that is reused; this will exclude verba dicendi, etc. For example,
29
As we have seen before, Archestratus has two possible places of origin and the CITE Archi-
tecture cites both. In this case another CITE URN refers to the possible origin of Arches-
tratus from Gela (urn:cite:digAth:mentions.2). Both CITE URNs (Mentions) correspond
to urn:cite:digAth:authors.auth20 (Authors): see below.
30
Archestratus’ work is transmitted with four different titles and therefore there are
four different CITE URNs for Mentions:
urn:cite:digAth:mentions.3 (Γαστρονο-
μία), urn:cite:digAth:mentions.4 (Ἡδυπάθεία), urn:cite:digAth:mentions.5 (Δειπνολο-
γία) and urn:cite:digAth:mentions.6 (Ὀψοποιία). All these CITE URNs correspond to
urn:cite:digAth:works.work1 (Works).
31
This passage refers to Archestratus with his two possible places of origin and the CTS
URN is valid for both urn:cite:digAth:mentions.1 (Ἀρχέστρατος ὁΣυρακούσιος) and
urn:cite:digAth:mentions.2 (Ἀρχέστρατος ὁΓελῷος).
32
In this case the text of the Deipnosophists doesn’t mention the name of Eratosthenes, but
the expression “the Cyrenean poet” (ὁΚυρηναῖος ποιητής) that has to be referred to Er-
atosthenes (cf. Suda [Ε 2898] s.v. Ἐρατοσθένης).

3.2 The CITE Architecture
111
“τρὶς δ᾿άπομαξαμένοισι θεοὶδιδόασιν ἄμεινον” is the verse of Eratosthenes.
– Analytical Edition URN [may be empty; only for extant works]: a CTS URN
that attaches the reused text (from Athenaeus) to the ordered, hierarchical
citation scheme of the reused work. Where Athenaeus reuses text from extant
works, which exist in other editions with citation schemes, we can produce
an Analytical Edition of that work, the “Athenaeus Edition”; this edition can
be cited by CTS URNs. For lost works, there is no citation scheme, nor any
inherent order to the text. For these, we will produce a collection of text
reuses. This Collection can be cited by CITE URNs.
– Alignment URN [may be empty; only for extant works]: a CTS URN that
specifies text in another edition of the reused work, used to assert an explicit
alignment between Athenaeus’ language and the language of another text.
For example, the use of βουλεύεσθαι at Ath., Deipn. 1.18 can be interpreted as
an allusion to βουληφόρε at Iliad 20.83; this is not a literal string match, nor
are the two instances of the same lexical entity; we are asserting an alignment
that is not discoverable by any automated process; the alignment urn allows
us to make this alignment explicit.
– Commentary [may be empty]: a commenary that explains the interpretation
of the text reuse.
– Resp.: The editor responsible for asserting the existence of, and documenting,
this instance of text reuse.
Further experiments with this data model have been performed for annotating
reuses of Homeric poetry in the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus with examples from
the Iliad, which means working with reuses of a still extant work.34 In this case
the data model developed by the CITE Architecture specifies six pieces of infor-
mation (records) to document text reuse:35
1. Analysis Record URN. Every documented instance of text reuse has a
CITE URN, that uniquely identifies this instance in a CITE collection. E.g.,
urn:cite:opdata:ahri:100 (item 100 in the ahri collection [Athenaeus’
Homeric Reuse: Iliad], in the opdata namespace [open philology data]).
2. Sequence Number. The collection of instances of Homeric text reuse is an
ordered collection; each item has a sequence number, reflecting the item’s
sequence in the text of the Deipnosophists. This value is programmatically
generated by a CTS-aware script before publication of the collection.
3. Analysed Text URN. A CTS URN that indentifies (as precisely or impre-
cisely as necessary) the span of text in the Deipnosophists that is the subject
34
As part of these experiments, citable analyses of text reuse of Homer’s Iliad in the Deip-
nosophists were collected by Ellie Daniel, Kimbell Dobbins, and Samantha Strickland from
Furman University during their internship at the University of Leipzig in the Summer 2015
under the supervision of Christopher W. Blackwell and myself.
35
A detailed description of the data model with examples is available in Berti/Blackwell et al.
(2016) 126–127, from which are taken the texts and the example mentioned in the following
pages.

112
3 Distributed Annotations of Fragmentary Texts
of this analysis of text reuse. The scope of the Analysed Text is determined
by the nature of the text reuse.
4. Reused Text. While the Analysed Text URN (above) identifies a coherent
and contiguous span of text, as it appears in the Edition being analysed, the
Reused Text is a string that identifies only the text being reused. The Anal-
ysed Text URN provides context and a basis for alignment, while the Reused
Text gives us the flexibility to call out non-contiguous text, to normalize
text, or even to promote morphological forms determined by indirect state-
ment to those appropriate for direct speech, without doing violence to our
source-Edition.
5. Alignment URN. This collection documents reuse of Homeric poetry, for
which there are extant editions with canonical citation. The Alignment
URN is a CTS URN that points to one specific edition of the Iliad that
(a) justifies the claim of text reuse, and (b) is the basis for attaching an Il-
iadic citation to this analysis. The Perseus edition of the Iliad of Homer
(urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus–grc:) is used for the Align-
ment URNs (edition by Thomas W. Allen).
6. Analytical Edition URN. The collected instances of Iliadic text reuse in
the Deipnosophists represent a new edition of the Iliad, whose text-content
is based on the analysis of the project’s edition of Athenaeus. The Analyt-
ical Edition URN is a CTS URN to an “Athenaeus Edition” of the Iliad; the
citation-value is based on that of the alignment URN; the text-content of
this edition is the reused text in Athenaeus. The Analytical Edition gives us
an orthogonal view of the Homeric text reuse in Athenaeus; it allows us to
navigate Athenaeus according to the OHCO2 structure of the Iliad. We cite
two notional editions in this field:
– urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.ogl1: is “Athenaeus’ edition of the Il-
iad.” We also cite, in at least one analysis,
– urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.ogl2: that is “Zenodotus’ edition of
the Iliad, according to Athenaeus.” ogl1 and ogl2 are 1) an Open Greek and
Latin edition of the “Iliad of Athenaeus,” consisting of collected Iliadic lan-
guage of the Deipnosophists, and 2) another Open Greek and Latin edition
of the “Iliad of Zenodotus, according to Athenaeus,” consisting of Iliadic
language attributed to Zenodotus’ edition in the Deipnosophists.36
36
For the example with a reference to the ancient scholar Zenodotus, see Ath., Deipn. 1.21
(= 12e–f) and Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016) 134–136 (for a detailed description) and 127.

3.2 The CITE Architecture
113
An example of this data model is a passage in the first book of the Deip-
nosophists (1.18 = 11a) where Athenaeus discusses how Homer equates drunke-
ness with madness:
καὶἈγαμέμνων δὲλέγει που περὶαὑτοῦ“Aἀλλ᾽ἐπεὶἀασάμην φρεσὶ
λευγαλέῃσι πιθήσας |Bἢοἴνῳμεθύων, ἤμ᾽ἔβλαψαν θεοὶαὐτοί,” εἰς
τὴν αὐτὴν τιθεὶς πλάστιγγα τὴν μέθην τῇμανίᾳ.37
The Homeric text under analysis is ἀλλ᾿[...] αὐτοί, but the “analysed text” be-
gins from καὶἈγαμέμνων […] because the introductory clause is the signal that
Athenaeus is quoting from Homer.38 The two lines of Homer generate two dif-
ferent records in the text reuse data: (A) and (B).
A (ἀλλ᾽ἐπεὶἀασάμην φρεσὶλευγαλέῃσι πιθήσας) is most straightforward
because it is a direct quotation of Homer that matches established editions of the
Iliad. It is possible to assign an Analysis Record URN and fill in the other data fields
(fig. 3.1). The first line of poetry in this passage of Athenaeus is found verbatim in
Iliad 9.119, when Agamemnon is expressing remorse for the quarrel with Achilles.
This will be the 100th instance of text reuse in the collection of Iliadic text reuse
in Athenaeus. This instance of reuse emerges when we analyse the passage that
begins “And Agamemnon says, somewhere […].” The specific reused text in the
passage under analysis is ἀλλ᾽[...] πιθήσας. This instance aligns with 9.119 in the
Perseus edition of the Iliad. In the “Iliad according to Athenaeus’ Deipnosophists,”
we can identify this text as 9.119, following the canonical citation of the poem.
Figure 3.1. Athen., Deipn. 1.18 (11a) – record (A)
B (ἢοἴνῳμεθύων, ἤμ᾽ἔβλαψαν θεοὶαὐτοί) is more complicated be-
cause Athenaeus is quoting a line that does not appear in any (other) edi-
tion of the Iliad.
It will share some data values with (A), but differ in oth-
37
“And Agamemnon says, somewhere, about himself, ‘But since I acted foolishly, obeying
my addled thoughts | either I was drunk with wine, or the gods themselves harmed me,’
placing drunkeness on the same balance as insanity.” Trans. Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016)

Figure 3.2. Athen., Deipn. 1.18 (11a) – record (B)
ers (fig. 3.2). In this editorial judgement, the dactylic hexameter text ἢοἴνῳ
μεθύων, ἤμ᾽ἔβλαψαν θεοὶαὐτοί is an instance of Homeric text reuse.
It
is assigned its own Analysis Record URN. This finding is the result of the
analysis of the text at urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.berti:1.18@καὶ[17]–
1.18@αὐτοί[1]. (B) shares the same Analysed Text URN as (A). The text of (B) is
after that of (A) in the text of Athenaeus, so (B) has a Sequence number one higher
than that of (A). The Analysed Text passage presents (A) and (B) as a natural se-
quence, rather than two quotations juxtaposed by Athenaeus. Because the Align-
ment URN locates (A) in the Iliad, and because the Analysed Text unites (A) and
(B), it is possible to use urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus–grc1:9.119
as the Alignment URN for (B) as well. However, in this “Athenaeus Edition” of
the Iliad, (B) is an additional citeable passage, which is identified as 9.119a.
3.3 Perseids Fragmentary Texts Editor
To annotate quotations and text reuses of fragmentary authors in digital source
texts experiments have been performed within Perseids, which “offers a free and
open online environment to produce collaborative data-driven editions of ancient
documents.”39
The work was developed in 2012 and 2013 as part of a collaboration be-
tween the Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the Univer-
sity of Leipzig and the Perseus Digital Library. The result is a demo version of a
Fragmentary Texts Editor (FTE) within Perseids, whose aim was to produce a pro-

See http://www.perseids.org. The development of Perseids was inspired by the work
of several pre-existing projects, such as the Tufts Miscellany Collection at Tisch Library
at Tufts University, the Homer Multitext project, and Papyri.info. The Son of SUDA OnLine
(SoSOL) application is at the core of Perseids. For more information, see Almas/Berti (2013),

The FTE demo uses methods of inline and stand-off markup to produce stable
ways for identifying and annotating text reuse, including canonical citations,
morpho-syntactic analyses, translation and text alignments. The FTE demo in-
terface collects texts from the printed edition of the fragments of Istros the Calli-
machean that I published in Berti (2009b). In this section I focus on a passage of
the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus (3.6 = 74e) that preserves a text reuse of Istros (F

tions for visualizing fragmentary texts.42 The left side of the demo is devoted to

– Source Text. This tab shows the passage of the source preserving the reuse
according to different editions. In this case the text of Deipn. 3.6 is pre-
sented in two tabs according to the two editions by Charles B. Gulick and
Georg Kaibel. The interface provides CTS URNs of Edition 143 and of Edi-
tion 2,44 and a function for visualizing the entire TEI XML file and the full
text of the two editions in separate windows.45 The “Show/Hide Quote”
hyperlink allows to highlight and hide in both editions the passage with
the reference to Istros, providing also the CTS URNs of the passage in the
two editions of the source text with a substring corresponding to the high-
lighted range of text.46 The portion of text highlighted in yellow corre-
sponds to the chunk of text of Deipn. 3.6 classified as fragment 12 in Berti
(2009b).47
– Witnesses. This tab is for representing other sources that preserve the
same or a similar text reuse of a fragmentary text. In the example described
here the tab is not active because there are no other witnesses for this frag-
ment of Istros.48
– Parallel. This tab allows to visualize parallel sources of the fragment of
Istros, which means other sources about the same topic.49
On the right side of the interface it is possible to visualize information about the
fragment annotated in the source text on the left side:
– Lost Content Item.
This tab provides a short summary of the con-
tent of the fragment with information about its editor.
Given that
this is a reuse of a lost text, the fragment is cited with a CITE URN:
urn:cite:perseus:lci.2.1. In the syntax of the CITE URN, lci stands for
Lost Content Items, which is the collection of text reuses of lost texts in the
FTE demo. Number 2 identifies the fragment in the collection. On the use
43
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus–grc1:3.6
44
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus–grc2:3.6
45
This function is not anymore available in the demo. The goal of the interface was to include
more than one edition of the same source text.
46
The CTS URN has a URL prefix in order to be part of a resolvable web address. In the CTS
syntax the FTE demo still uses the symbol “#” instead of “@” for separating the subreference
from the passage (e.g., #Ἴστρος1–συκοφάνται1): see Almas/Berti (2013), n. 1.
47
The FTE was implemented to include more editions of the same fragment, which means
representing different annotations of the same text reuse by different editors. For this
function, cf. the demo.fragmentarytexts.org described in section 2.2.
48
Berti (2009b) 99. Berti Istros F4 in the FTE demo provides the text of Suda [Π 152] s.v.
Παναθήναια as one of the “witnesses” of the fragment of Istros: https://pubs.perseids.org/
berti_demo/src/index.html. In this case the fragment has another witness (Photius), but,
being a demo, the FTE provides only the text of sources available in a digital format. Cf.
Berti (2009b) 59.
49
In this case the two parallel sources in the FTE are Plut., Sol. 24.1 (whose text is visualized
with its CTS URN) and Suda [Σ 1330] s.v. συκοφαντεῖν (with a link to the Suda On Line
project). For other parallel sources of this fragment, see Berti (2009b) 99–102.

– Translation. This tab provides translations of the text of the fragment.50
– Commentary. This tab provides a commentary to the fragment. As for
other annotations, the FTE demo was originally planned to include more
commentaries about the same reuse and each of them was collected and
identified in a Perseus Collection of Commentaries on Lost Content Items.51
– Aligment. This tab provides alignments of the text of the fragment with its
witnesses and/or parallel texts.52 Translation alignments in the demo were
produced in the Perseids platform using the Alpheios Translation Alignment
Editor.
– Syntax. This tab shows morpho-syntactic annotations of the text of the
fragment. Text reuse works not only at a word level, but also at a syntactic
one, because reusing a text means not only quoting and readapting words
in a new context, but also reproducing syntactic features. In this case the
goal is to produce annotations of text reuses with the Alpheios Treebank
Editor in order to collect and detect different examples of syntactic reuses
(e.g., reuse of different words with the same syntax and/or reuse of the same
words with a different syntax).53
– Links. This tab provides links to printed editions of the source text and of
the fragmentary author through available resources, as for example Google
Books and Internet Archive, or by uploading PDF files in the FTE demo.54
The work behind the Fragmentary Texts Editor combines TEI XML files, the Open
Annotation Core (OAC) data model, and the CITE Architecture to represent quo-
tations and text reuses via Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. All of
the textual and data elements presented in the display are defined as OAC an-
notations made available to the display code in a JSON-LD data structure. The
subject and object resources of these triples are resolved by Canonical Text and
CITE Collection Services to the TEI XML and other source data in real time in
order to produce new dynamic, data-driven representations of the aggregated in-
formation.55
50
In this case there are the English translation of the passage of the Deipnosophists from the
edition by Charles D. Yonge and the Italian translation of the fragment of Istros from Berti
(2009b).

3 Distributed Annotations of Fragmentary Texts
As I showed in section 3.2, a quotation of a still surviving text can be rep-
resented with a RDF triple: [subject cts–urn–1] quotes [object cts–urn–2]. For
example, I represent the annotation of a quotation of Homer in Athenaeus as:
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:3.X.x
(Athen., Deipn. passage X.x)
quotes
urn:cts:tlg0012.tlg001:X.xx
(Hom., Il. passage X.xx)
When working with text reuses of lost works the situation is different, because
the original text of the reused author is lost and we have just the text of the
reusing author, which is the only citable evidence. For this reason, a Perseus
Collection of Lost Content Items (urn:cite:perseus:lci) was created as part of
the FTE. These LCIs are assigned CITE URNs as unique identifiers, and assigned
descriptive properties, for example naming a specific text reuse of a lost author
as it is represented in a modern edition because we don’t have the original text
of the lost author and we have to express the citation at an edition-level. In our
example (Athen., Deipn. 3.6), the annotation triple is represented in the following
way:
urn:cite:perseus:lci.2.156
quotes
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:3.6#Ἴστρος[1]–συκοφάνται[1]57
This triplet expresses the relation between an object in a CITE Collection (an
edition of a fragment of Istros) and a passage of a text (the Deipnosophists of
Athenaeus who quotes Istros).
Annotations, and the texts and entities that they annotate, are the primary
data type behind the FTE demo. The demo combines the TEI XML (EpiDoc subset)
in which the source texts are encoded, with the CTS and CITE data models for
URN based text and data object identifiers, the CTS and CITE service APIs, and
the OAC standard for serialization of annotations.58 This application of standards
and data enables to present a new dynamic data-driven display leveraging Linked
Open Data and also to publish annotation data in a standard format to facilitate
its reuse.
The use of the OAC model enables to express FTE annotations according to
a defined and documented standard, increasing the feasibility of their reuse. Us-
ing the OAC data model, annotations are expressed as simple URI based triples,
56
This is the CITE URN identifier for the Perseus Collection Object that represents the text
reuse of Istros with a reference to the edition of Berti (2009b), where this portion of
Athenaeus’ text is reproduced and classified as Istros F12.
57
This is the CTS URN identifier for Athen., Deipn. 3.6 with the addition of substring refer-
ence for greater precision.
58
On the Perseus CTS API, see Almas/Berti (2013).

3.3 Perseids Fragmentary Texts Editor
119
with a controlled vocabulary to identify the motivation for the annotation. Ac-
cording to OAC, an annotation “target” is the resource being annotated and the
annotation “body” is the resource containing the contents of the annotation. The
URIs used for annotation bodies and targets can resolve to anything from sim-
ple text strings and vocabulary terms, to complex morpho-syntactic annotations.
OAC also supports many-to-many relationships between annotation targets and
annotation bodies. This is particularly useful for text reuse annotations, where
the text being reused (and/or the instance of its reuse) cannot be expressed by a
single contiguous range of text and instead is surrounded by words which are not
explicitly part of the reuse. In this case, we can use multiple CTS URN identifiers
for the substrings within the passage, the set of which become the target and/or
body of the annotation.
The primary set of annotations driving the demo links the passages from the
extant source text to the lost content item. These annotations identify the URI of
the extant source text in which a reuse occurs as the target of the annotation and
the URI of the CITE object representing the lost content item as the body of the
annotation. I use the OAC vocabulary term classifying to define the motivation
for these annotations, as we are classifying the passage in the extant source text as
an occurrence of text reuse. By contrast, my commentary annotations reference
the URI for the lost content item itself as the annotation target, and the URI for the
commentary as the annotation body. Translations of source texts reference the
URIs for the source text passages as their targets, and the URIs of the translated
passages as their bodies.
The OAC vocabulary term chosen for the motivation in this case is linking. I
link additional supporting resources, including other witnesses, translation align-
ments and morpho-syntactic annotations in a similar manner. The OA model en-
ables to serialize every annotation in its most simple form, as a link between one
or more target items being annotated, and one or more bodies representing the
contents of the annotation. OA also gives a standard vocabulary for categorizing
the motivation for the annotations. URIs are used to specify both the target and
the body of the annotation.
The OA data model was used both as the primary representation of an anno-
tation, in cases where the annotations are created by linking two identifiers (such
as a link between a passage in a text and an identifier for a named entity or event),
and also as a serialization method for more complex annotations, where the an-
notation process involves the creation of complex documents as the annotation
bodies which can be then referenced by their URI identifiers. In the latter case,
a variety of standard formats was used for the actual annotation bodies, includ-
ing the Perseus Ancient Greek and Latin Treebank schema for morpho-syntactic
analyses, the Alpheios translation alignment schema for text alignments, Mark-

down Syntax for short textual commentaries, TEI XML for primary and secondary
source texts.59
Using the JSON-LD syntax recommended by OAC allows to build a dynamic
display interface in Javascript that navigates the JSON-LD data object and re-
trieves the datasets identified as the targets and bodies of the annotations at
their addressable URIs. The demo code retrieves the resources that are identi-
fied by CTS and CITE URN enabled URIs (as served by the CTS and CITE ser-
vices discussed above) asynchronously as the page loads and in response to user
interaction with interface widgets, and uses XSLT stylesheets to transform the
XML content of the resources returned to HTML for display. The non CTS and
CITE enabled resources are served by various other web applications, present-
ing various formats of data, and, due to time constraints, the demo currently
presents these resources as links which open the original resource in a new tab
or window. The annotation that represents the assertion according to which a
text at Athen., Deipn. 3.6 describes a reuse of a lost work of Istros identified by
urn:cite:perseus:lci.2, serialized in OA using the JSON-LD format, might be
formalized as follows:60

The Perseids platform has at its core the Son of SUDA OnLine (SoSOL) applica-
tion, which is a Ruby on Rails application originally developed by Papyri.info that
serves as front end for a Git repository of documents, metadata, and annotations.
It includes a workflow engine that enables documents and data of different types

to pass through flexible review and approval process.61 The SoSOL application
includes user interfaces for editing XML documents, metadata, and annotations
(fig. 3.4).
Figure 3.4. Perseids XML editing environment
When developing features of Perseids to support these workflows, the focus was
first and foremost on the data. Considering that technologies change in a rapid
way and while including prototype representations of digital editions suitable
for publication on the web, the first priority was to enable scholars to create data
about the authors, texts and related commentaries, annotations, links, and trans-
lations in a way that encourages and facilitates their preservation and reuse.
The following core requirements were identified to meet this goal: the abil-
ity to represent the texts themselves, links between them, and annotations and
commentaries on them, in semantically and structurally meaningful ways that
adhere to well-accepted and documented standard formats; stable and resolvable
identifiers for all relevant data points, including the lost authors and their works,
the authors and extant texts that preserve quotations and text reuses of the lost
works, different editions and translations of the lost and extant texts, named enti-
ties (e.g., persons, places, and events) mentioned within the texts, commentaries
and annotations on the texts from ancient times through the present; the ability
to group any of the data points into collections representing different contextual
views of the data; the ability to accurately represent provenance information for
data and workflows.
As part of the FTE demo project and in order to represent the workflow of
a scholar who identifies and edits a text reuse of a lost work, an experiment was
done by applying and extending the Systematic Assertion Model (SAM), which is

a framework developed at the University of Illinois for the description of prove-
nance roles and agents essential to the identity of scientific data that accounts for
the events and roles essential to the creation of text-like resources.62
The focus of many provenance models, such as the W3C PROV model, is on
functional elements and processes of computational activities, while SAM sup-
plies a detailed account of the particular ways symbol structures are used in schol-
arly data and discourse. The experiment was done by presentig an example text
reuse scenario drawn from Perseids, demonstrating the use of a SAM-based RDF
vocabulary extended to support textual research in the humanities, along with el-
ements from PROV and the Open Annotation data model. This integrated account
provides a rich, contextualized view of the encoding and use of data in humanities
research (fig. 3.5).63
To test the extensions to the SAM framework, the project team modeled an
example of a scholarly assertion of text reuse. In this use case, the scholar (Berti)
identifies a section of text from Plutarch, Solon 24.1 that she believes was drawn
from the lost work of Istros the Callimachean:64
τῶν δὲγινομένων διάθεσιν πρὸς ξένους ἐλαίου μόνον ἔδωκεν, ἄλλα
δ᾿ἐξάγειν ἐκώλυσε· καὶκατὰτῶν ἐξαγόντων ἀρὰς τὸν ἄρχοντα ποι-
εῖσθαι προσέταξεν, ἢἐκτίνειν αὐτὸν ἑκατὸν δραχμὰς εἰς τὸδημό-
σιον. καὶπρῶτος ἄξων ἐστὶν ὁτοῦτον περιέχων τὸν νόμον. οὐκ ἂν
οὖν τις ἡγήσαιτο παντελῶς ἀπιθάνους τοὺς λέγοντας ὅτι καὶσύκων
ἐξαγωγὴτὸπαλαιὸν ἀπείρητο, καὶτὸφαίνειν ἐνδεικνύμενον τοὺς
ἐξάγοντας κληθῆναι συκοφαντεῖν.
The scholar wants to create an annotation that connects Plutarch’s text back to
Istros. To substantiate this argument, she identifies corroborating material from
another primary source, which is Athenaeus’ reference to Istros in the Deip-
nosophists 3.6:65

“Of the products of the soil, he allowed oil only to be sold abroad, but forbade the ex-
portation of others; and if any did so export, the archon was to pronounce curses upon
them, or else himself pay a hundred drachmas into the public treasury. His first table is
the one which contains this law. One cannot, therefore, wholly disbelieve those who say
that the exportation of figs also was anciently forbidden, and that the one who showed
up, or pointed out such exporters, was called a ‘sycophant,’ or fig-shower.” Trans. Perrin
(1914). See Berti (2009b) 99–102.

“Istrus in his Attic History says that the dried figs produced by these trees were not exported
from Attica, in order that only the inhabitants of the country could enjoy them. When
many people were found to be evading the law, those who informed the jurors about them
were then for the first time referred to as sycophants.” Trans. by Olson (2006–2012).

This scenario could include references to other primary sources that directly
quote, allude to, or paraphrase Istros or the consultation of additional resources,
such as comparisons of syntactic analyses and translations, or scholarly commen-
taries.66
Figure 3.5 shows the workflow of this text reuse scenario: Scholar Berti
[B] is the agent of an Indication [B1] — the selection of a string of text. [B1]
informs an Activity [S1] by the system — a Computation [S2] of the URI for a
text passage [P1] by Plutarch [P]. [B] makes an Assertion [B2], the substance of
which is Propositional Content [B3] as expressed by an Annotation [B4] targeting
the Plutarch text [P1] as a reuse of a Lost Content Item [l1] attributed to Istros the
Callimachaen [l]. [B] indicates another string of text [B5] that informs an Activity
[S3] by the system — a Computation [S4] of the URI for a text passage [A2] by
Athenaeus [A]. The text at [A2] is the primary expression of an Assertion [A1], the
substance of which is Propositional Content [A3] as expressed by an Annotation
[A4] targeting [A2] as a reuse of Lost Content Item [l1] attributed to Istros. B’s
Assertion [B2] is warranted by A’s ancient Assertion [A1].
Combining SAM entities and properties with those from other models, such
as W3C’s PROV and Open Annotation (OA), provides a richer, more contextualized
view of data encoding and use in humanities research:
– SAM Indication. Event in which some abstract structures (e.g., a series
of characters) are indicated in the pursuit of some intellectual or creative
goal.
– SAM Assertion. Event in which an agent advances a claim. The primary
expressive may be a natural language sentence or any abstract arrangement
of symbols. Assertions that are warranted by observations or computations
are systematic assertions.
– SAM Prospositional Content. Language-independent bearer of truth
values.
– SAM Computation.
An event that may reflect contingencies such as
scholarly interpretation. Does not necessarily imply creation. E.g., an ana-
lytic process may indicate a string of text which already existed.
– PROV Activity. Event through which entities come into existence and/or
change to become new entities. Activities are dynamic aspects of the world,
such as actions, processes, etc.

– OA Annotation. Expresses the relationship between two or more re-
sources, including metadata about the relationship concerning creation and
intent.
Combining complementary data provenance models enables to more precisely
track and document shared resources, ultimately improving data quality and en-
couraging further sharing. Using PROV Activities, it was possible to share precise
details about system actions and processes leading to the extraction of text and
creation of URI endpoints. SAM was used to identify the contingent aspect of
the underlying resources as things which are subject to interpretation and which
were in existence prior to their use as data in our analysis. OA was used to share
concrete serializations of the analyses in the form of annotations.67 In this use
case the model enabled to (1) reference ancient data that can be identified but that
did not literally come into existence as the result of any modern computational
interaction (and which may in fact no longer be extant in any preserved source),
and (2) identify the role a data item, such as an ancient scholarly assertion, plays
as the vehicle for the modern scholarly claims. A third (3) requirement, which
results from the second, is that it was necessary to represent the assertions of the
ancient scholars, on which our modern assertions depend, in a format that can
be included computationally in a common data set with the modern claims.

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum
This chapter presents origin and characteristics of the Digital Fragmenta His-
toricorum Graecorum (DFHG) project, which is the dynamic and expanded
version of the printed edition of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
(FHG) that was originally edited by Karl Müller. The first section (4.1) de-
scribes the printed edition of the FHG. The second section (4.2) describes
reasons and general characteristics of the DFHG project, while the third
and fourth sections (4.3 and 4.4) describe in details its tools and add-ons.
The two final sections present two projects about two documents included
in the printed collection of the FHG with two fragmentary inscriptions: the
Digital Marmor Parium project (4.5) and the Digital Rosetta Stone project
(4.6).
4.1 The Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
The Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG) is an edition of five volumes edited
by Karl Müller with the help of his brother Theodor Müller and Victor Langlois.
The work was printed in Paris between 1841 and 1873 by the publisher Ambroise
Firmin Didot.1
This edition is the first big collection of ancient Greek historical fragments
consisting of excerpts (fragmenta) from many different sources pertaining to 636
ancient Greek fragmentary historians. Authors cover a period of time from the
6th century BC through the 7th century CE and, excluding the first volume, are
chronologically distributed in the collection. Fragments are numbered sequen-
tially, arranged by works and book numbers if these pieces of information are
available in the source text, and almost every Greek fragment is translated or

political context of this enterprise, see Petitmengin (1983) and Grafton (1997). Karl Müller
edited also the fragments of the minor Greek geographers, the fragments of the historians
of Alexander the Great, and the fragments of Ctesias and of the chronographers: Müller
(1855–1861), Dübner/Müller (1846), Dindorf/Müller (1858).

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
summarized into Latin.2 The predecessor of the FHG is the collection planned
by Creuzer (1806) (Historicorum Graecorum Antiquissimorum Fragmenta), who
published the first part with the fragments of Hecataeus, Charon, and Xanthus,
but didn’t complete the project. Ctesias was published by Bähr (1824), Epho-
rus by Marx (1815), and Philistus and Timaeus by Göller (1818). Hellanicus,
Pherecydes, and Acusilaus had already been published by Sturz (1787) and Sturz
(1789).3
Other collections of fragmentary historians included Philochorus by
Lenz/Siebelis (1811), who also added the fragments of the Atthis of Androtion,
the Atthidographers by Lenz/Siebelis (1812), Theopompus by Wichers (1829), and
Phylarchus by Lucht (1836) and Brückner (1839). Surviving fragments of minor
Greek historians were published by Dindorf (1870–1871).4
FHG I collects 19 fragmentary historians together with the Bibliotheca
of Apollodorus and its fragments, the Parian Marble with Latin introduction,
translation, and commentary by Karl Müller, and the Greek text of the Rosetta
Stone with French introduction, translation, and commentary by Jean-Antoine
Letronne:
Hecataeus
Charon
Xanthus
Hellanicus
Pherecydes
Acusilaus
Apollodorus Atheniensis

Timaeus
Ephorus
Theopompus
Phylarchus
Clidemus
Phanodemus
Androtio
Demo
Philochorus
Ister
Apollodorus
Marmor Parium
Marmor Rosettanum
Fragmentary authors of this volume are dated between the 6th and the 2nd cen-
tury BC. After a first part with the fragments of Hecataeus of Miletus, Charon of
Lampsacus, Xanthus of Lydia, Hellanicus of Lesbus, Pherecydes, and Acusilaus
of Argos, Müller adds a supplement with the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus, who
is identified with the homonymous grammarian of Athens whose fragments of
other works are printed at the end of the volume. After this section he adds the
fragments of the historians of Sicily (Antiochus of Syracuse, Philistus of Syra-
cuse, Timaeus of Tauromenius), of Ephorus, Theopompus, and Phylarchus, and
finally of the Atthidographers (Clidemus, Phanodemus, Androtio, Demo, Philo-
chorus, Ister): FHG I, i–vii. The Parian Marble and the Greek text of the Rosetta
Stone were added in an appendix at the end of the volume for their importance as

historical and philological documents: FHG I, vii. The chronicle preserved by the
inscription of the so called Marmor Parium is a fragmentary work in the literal
sense of the word. The Marmor Rosettanum was added with the French literal
translation of the Greek text that Jean-Antoine Letronne produced at the request
of Jean-François Champollion to help him with the analysis of the differences
between the Egyptian and the Greek versions of the decree carved on the stone
(FHG I, v–viii from the avertissement of the section with the Marmor Rosettanum
at the end of the volume).5
FHG II–IV include a total of ten books (libri) corresponding to a chrono-
logical distribution of the authors (see figure 1.9). FHG II contains the first four
books corresponding to different periods of time between 520 and 247 BC (FHG

translations and commentaries of texts and fragments of 11 Greek and Syrian
authors whose works were translated and preserved in Armenian sources (histo-

Every volume of the FHG has a praefatio (except for volume III), an index
nominum et rerum, an index auctorum, an index titulorum, and addenda et cor-
rigenda. FHG I has a unique introduction at the beginning of the volume for all
the authors collected in it (de vita et scriptis auctorum, quorum fragmenta hoc vo-
lumine comprehenduntur) and its own index nominum et rerum at the end of the
volume. The Parian Marble and the Rosetta Stone have separate introductions
and the Rosetta Stone has a separate index (Table de mots grecs, et des principaux
faits expliqués). Starting from FHG II and when necessary, introductions to au-
thors are printed at the beginning of each relevant section. Addenda et corrigenda
of volumes I–IV and the index nominum et rerum of volumes II–IV are printed at
the end of FHG IV. This volume includes also and index auctorum and an index
titulorum of volumes I–IV.8
As anticipated in chapter 1, the volumes of Karl Müller were followed
and superseded by the collection of Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker
(FGrHist) edited by Felix Jacoby (pp. 35 ff.). In a fundamental paper about the
plan for a new collection of the fragments of the Greek historians (Über die En-
twicklung der griechischen Historiographie und den Plan einer neuen Sammlung
der griechischen Historikerfragmente), Felix Jacoby explains the reasons of his en-
terprise and discusses advantages and disadvantages of four different principles
for arranging collections of historical fragments:9 1) alphabetical order (alpha-
betische Ordnung), 2) chronological order (chronologische Ordnung), 3) local order
(lokale Ordnung), and 4) historical development (das Entwicklungsgeschichtliche

Jacoby (1909). This paper is now available in the English translation by Mortimer Chambers
and Stefan Schorn, which is based on the 1956 version of the text that was published with
editorial additions of Herbert Bloch in a selection of Jacoby’s essays and reviews: Jacoby
(1956); Jacoby (2015).

4.1 The Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum

Prinzip). Jacoby asserts his decision to follow the principle of the historical de-
velopment, which means the arrangement of the historical writings according to
literary genres. As a matter of fact, this is the principle that would have guided
the publication of fragmentary historians in the FGrHist and whose structure
(die Gesamtanlage der Fragmentsammlung) is explained in the above mentioned
paper. While doing this, Jacoby also describes the limits of Karl Müller’s collec-
tion complaining about “the lack of independence, the failure of criticism, and
the incompleteness of the collection […] the inconvenient, at many times abso-
lutely arbitrary order of the fragments and the authors […]” and about the fact
that “the chronological boundaries of the separate books are not useful and are
usually wrongly determined […].”10
Limits and lacks of the work of Müller are well known in the scholarly
community. It’s also indisputable that the collection of the FGrHist represents
a huge advancement in the editorial practice of historiographical studies and that
its monumental result is still an unsurpassed product of 20th-century philology.
Nevertheless, the goal of this book is not to discuss limits of the FHG and praise
scientific achievements of the FGrHist, but to describe how fragmentary authors
and works can be collected and edited in a computational environment.
The following sections describe the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graeco-
rum (DFHG) project, which is not a new edition of ancient Greek fragmentary
historians, but a digital model to provide textual, philological, and computational
methods for representing fragmentary authors and works in digital libraries. The
reason for choosing the collection of the FHG depends on different factors:11 1)
an interest in Greek fragmentary historiography, which offers many examples of
reuse of prose texts whose complexities are shared by other genres of fragmen-
tary literature;12 2) the necessity of digitizing printed editions and preserving
them not only as image files but also as structured machine readable collections
that can be accessed for experimenting with text mining of historical languages;13
3) the importance of the FHG for understanding more recent editions of Greek
historical fragments and in particular the FGrHist by Felix Jacoby, who spent his
life to change and improve the collection created by Karl Müller;14 4) the fact that
the corpus of the FHG is open (i.e., free of copyright) and big enough to perform
computational experiments and obtain results.

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
4.2 The DFHG Project
The Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DFHG) is a project with a twofold
aim: 1) digitize and preserve printed critical editions of fragmentary authors and
2) digitally represent fragmenta of lost authors and works according to the model
of the technology of the printed book.15 The reasons for choosing the collection of
the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum have been explained in section 4.1. Also,
the goal of the DFHG project is not isolated. In the broad field of the digital
humanities, the digitization of printed editions has quite a long history, and im-
pressive results are now available thanks to initiatives like Google Books, Internet
Archive, HathiTrust and Europeana, just to mention some of the most important
collections.
In the field of Classical philology and specifically of fragmentary historiog-
raphy, a parallel project is the Jacoby Online, part of which is dedicated to the
digital preservation of the printed volumes of Die Fragmente der griechischen His-
toriker edited by Felix Jacoby (see pp. 63 ff.). Even if the common goal is to
preserve printed critical editions of historical fragments, there are significant dif-
ferences between the Jacoby Online and the DFHG. Data and accessibility to the
DFHG project are open, not only because the volumes of the FHG are out of copy-
right, but also because this is a research project born in the spirit of the Open Greek
and Latin (OGL) initiative and developed in an academic institution and not in a
publishing company.16 The DFHG doesn’t include a new edition of the fragments
like the Brill’s New Jacoby, but extracts and expands DFHG data for further im-
plementations and connections with other editions and corpora. Extraction and
expansion of DFHG data involve philological interpretations and editorial deci-
sions that build a model for a new form of digital critical editing. Finally, DFHG
data and their implementation are important not only for a better understanding
of ancient Greek fragmentary historiography, but also for contributing to the in-
crease of digital data in the original ancient language, which is now essential and
urgent for future advancements in the field of Digital Classical Philology.17
In its current version, the DFHG project was developed between 2015 and
2018. The starting point was the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output
of the five volumes of the FHG that was produced as part of the OGL project.18
15
The project is available at http://www.dfhg-project.org. On the discussion about the use
of the terms “digitized” and “digital” to refer to digital scans of books, see Sahle (2016) and
Huskey (2019) 21 n. 8. In this respect, the DFHG project adopts the form “digital” because it
is not a mere scan of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum, but a philologically expanded
and enriched version of it.
16
On the OGL project and related activities, see Muellener (2019).
17
On these two last aspects, see the contributions in Berti (2019a).
18
See section 4.3.1.

4.2 The DFHG Project
137
Most of the work was spent on structuring the OCR output in order to produce
a database of the entire FHG collection. Parallel and sequent work was focused
on the creation of tools and add-ons that are extensively described in sections 4.3
and 4.4.
The DFHG project has been processing the following FHG data: 5 vol-
umes, 636 authors, 979 fragmentary works, 7256 fragments, 7925 source texts,
and 2,315,700 tokens.19
Figure 4.1. DFHG home page
The goal of the project was not only to produce digital data of ancient Greek his-
torical fragments, but also to implement a model for a Digital Classics project
that is sustainable in terms of temporal, financial, and computational resources.20
This is the reason why the project is first of all focused on the philological struc-
ture of the FHG collection in order to organize it in a database that permits the
extraction of structured DFHG data for producing different types of philological
resources. Moreover, DFHG data is downloadable and exportable for future de-
19
The expression fragmentary works refers to the number of titles of fragmentary works
attested in the FHG. Fragments refers to the number of fragments collected in the FHG even
if they include more than one source text (on this issue, see p. 151 n. 51). Source texts refers
to the number of extant texts collected in the FHG because they preserve quotations and
text reuses of other texts, and their number is bigger than the number of fragments because
it happens that Karl Müller collects more sources under the same fragment number. For
an expanded catalog of DFHG fragmentary authors and witnesses, see sections 4.4.1 and
4.4.2.

velopments of the project and for further implementations by other scholars.21
From a computational point of view, the DFHG project was conceived to be mod-
ular and easy to be updated and accessed. The modularity is based on creating
views of the data and services to analyze it around a database that represents the
original work of Karl Müller. The facility of updating data is guaranteed by the
structure of the database — that was projected more like a data warehouse than
a relational database — in order to be easily updated through loading CVS files
generated directly from the OCR output of the FHG volumes. Data is accessi-
ble through web-based services or APIs that manage it live. Web-based services
are AJAX oriented and make use of some of the state-of-the-art techniques like
asynchronous loading to guarantee the best possible usability (fig. 4.2). APIs are
coded to facilitate third-party services interaction with DFHG data.
The result is that the entire structure facilitates updates of the project in or-
der to follow technological advancements without a significant economical effort
using open source and free software for database and scripting technology. An-
other fundamental aspect is that all services are web-based so that users don’t
have to install complex frameworks to access data. The usage of modern web
design technologies (as for example AJAX) and of database capabilities allow to
create a series of advanced tools that are very powerful but light, like the DFHG
Digger and other tools for visualizing data that offer services without loading the
page.22
As already mentioned in section 4.1 and as it is possible to read in the fol-
lowing pages, the collection of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum adequately
represents the complexities of fragmentary authors and works because it includes
the most important characteristics of modern critical editions of historical frag-
ments, whose major achievement would have been reached by Felix Jacoby in the
FGrHist. In this respect, the representation of the FHG in the DFHG project offers
a model for the digital representation of fragmenta, by which I mean a digital rep-
resentation of historical quotations and text reuses based on the technology of the
printed book.23 This is the reason why the implementation of the DFHG project
has focused its attention on the element of the fragmentum as it was conceived
and represented by Karl Müller in his collection.

For another digital model of working with fragmenta and representing them as quotations
and text reuses within their context of transmission, see the Digital Athenaeus project in
chapter 5.

4.3 DFHG Tools
The DFHG provides users with a set of tools for accessing, querying, searching,
integrating, citing and exporting the collection of the Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum (fig. 4.3). These tools are based on the conversion of the printed edi-
tion of the FHG into a digital format and are described in the following sub-
sections: Content (4.3.1), Digger (4.3.2), Search (4.3.3), Integration (4.3.4), Data
Citation (4.3.5), Web API (4.3.6), and Outputs (4.3.7).
Figure 4.3. DFHG tools
4.3.1 Content
t The DFHG Content is the entire content of the five volumes of the FHG, which
is accessible online at http://www.dfhg-project.org. The online content can be
browsed by loading the whole collection or one single volume from the home-
page of the project (fig. 4.1). The DFHG slide in/out navigation menu represents
the structure of volumes, books, authors, works and fragments collected in the
printed edition, and it is available for the entire collection and for each volume.
The menu faithfully represents the arrangement of authors and texts in the FHG.
The “Expand All” and “Collapse All” functions allow scholars to navigate the FHG
with a comprehensive view of the structure of the whole collection by expanding
and collapsing every volume, book, author and work down to the fragment level.
This structure is very helpful because the printed version of the FHG doesn’t con-
tain detailed tables of contents of its volumes. At the beginning of each volume
there is a list of authors collected in it, but these lists are not complete because
they don’t always include authors collected in sections that group more than one
authors. For example, FHG II lists at the beginning only the name of Diony-
sius Milesius, whose fragments open a section that includes also the fragments of

Dionysius Mytilenaeus and Dionysius Rhodius or Samius (pp. 5–11). All author
names and work titles of voll. I–IV are available in the index auctorum and in the
index titulorum printed at the end of volume IV, but these indices are not meant
to be a list of contents of the whole collection. Only FHG V includes two tables
of contents for its two parts: p. 211 (scripta quae hoc volumine continentur) and
p. 421 (table des matières).
Figure 4.4. DFHG navigation menu (partly expanded)
Following each navigation menu element, users are able to jump to the relevant
section of the FHG without reloading the page (fig. 4.4).24 The navigation menu
gives access to the following contents as they are arranged in the FHG: volu-
mina (FHG I–V), praefationes (FHG I, II, IV and V), libri and other volume divi-
sions (FHG I–V), list of authors, works, books and fragments (FHG I–V), Index
Nominum et Rerum (FHG I), Index Marmoris Rosettani (FHG I), addenda et cor-
rigenda (FHG I–V).25 The DFHG main page of the entire collection and of each
volume allows to visualize and navigate the following contents (fig. 4.5):
A) introductions to FHG authors with notes;26
B) five-item rows for each fragment with the following data:
24
The DFHG appears as an Ajax web page automatically generated by a PHP script that
queries an SQL database of FHG contents. For a more detailed description of the visualiza-
tion of the DFHG main page, see section 4.3.1.2.
25
FHG III doesn’t have a praefatio. Still missing in the DFHG are the index auctorum, the
index titulorum, and the index nominum et rerum of volume II–IV that are printed at the
end of FHG IV, and the indices of the two sections of FHG V. Also, addenda et corrigenda
in the DFHG are represented as separate web pages at the end of each volume because
their integration in the relevant passages of the collection would have required too much
manual work. For a description of libri and other divisions of the FHG, see section 4.1.
26
FHG I has a unique introduction, which has been split into sections corresponding to each
author of the volume and inserted in the DFHG at the beginning of the relevant author
section. In this case the DFHG follows the model of the other FHG volumes, where almost
every author has a separate introduction (see below).

2) a reference to the source text of the fragment (sometimes with a short
or long commentary),
3) the Greek or the Latin text of the fragment,
4) the Latin (or French) translation/summary of Greek fragments,
5) the Latin (or French) commentary to the text of the fragment;

Books. The following are the Google Books IDs for the Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum: FHG I (y5pxAAAAIAAJ), FHG II (JA9DAAAAcAAJ), FHG III (beoUAAAAQAAJ),
FHG IV (quBFAQAAMAAJ), and FHG V (_N8GAAAAQAAJ). The |page= parameter links
specific page numbers. In the case of the FHG, there are pages for the inside cover
(|pg=PP), pages with Roman numerals (|pg=PR), and pages with Arabic numerals
(|pg=PA). These strings correspond to the actual pages of the printed edition and
allow to automatically generate Google Books URLs that link to FHG pages. Pages
of the three parts of FHG V (pars prior, première partie and seconde partie of pars
altera) are distinguished by adding RA1, RA2, and RA3 before the page number (e.g.,
|pg=RA2–PA48) in order to avoid conflicting URLs for the same page numbers of
different parts of the volume.31
In order to produce this visualization, the printed edition of the FHG has
been digitized and the output has been structured in a textual database. Each
volume has been OCRed by the social enterprise Digital Divide Data (DDD) and
released in five text files with a basic XML encoding that represents the layout
of each volume.32 Three XML tags are used in these files: <body> for each page
of the FHG, <p> for each paragraph within each page, and <pb> for each page
number. Other main elements of the layout of each page — as for example titles
of FHG sections and numbers of fragments — can be identified because they are
outside of XML tags and disposed in separate lines. Figures 4.6 and 4.7 show the
first page of the section with the fragments of Timaeus of Tauromenius (FHG
I 193). In the OCR output, elements outside of XML tags are arranged in sep-
arate lines as they were originally arranged in the printed edition: title section
(TIMAÆI|FRAGMENTA), work titles and subtitles (ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑΙ.|ΙΤΑΛΙΚΑ ΚΑΙ ΣΙ-
ΚΕΛΙΚΑ.), book divisions (LIBER PRIMUS.) and fragment numbers (1. and 2.).
Within each <p> tag, the arrangement of the text in different lines doesn’t corre-
spond to the original disposition of the text in the printed edition.33
All these characteristics have been used to structure semi-automatically the
contents of the entire collection of the FHG and produce a textual database. First
of all the structure has been generated by identifying the two main following
31
Due to the presence of the same page numbers in different parts of FHG V, it is possible
that page links of FHG V in the DFHG don’t point to the extact location in Google Books.

components represented by 1) paratextual elements like prefaces, introductions,
indices and addenda et corrigenda,34 and 2) FHG authors:
1) Paratextual elements have been extracted and treated separately:
a) Prefaces and addenda et corrigenda have been converted into HTML
files including footnotes and have been published online at the begin-
ning and at the end of each volume.35
b) Introductions have been extracted and added to the corresponding
parts in the DFHG. FHG I has a unique introduction (de vita et scrip-
tis auctorum, quorum fragmenta hoc volumine comprehenduntur) that
has been split into its subsections and added at the beginning of each
relevant author of FHG I.36 As mentioned before, in FHG II–IV al-
most every author has a separate introduction. The first part of FHG
V has prolegomena that have been partly inserted at the beginning of
the corresponding authors.37 The second part of FHG V has separate
introductions for each author.
c) The Index Nominum et Rerum and the Index Marmoris Rosettani of
FHG I have been structured in order to search their content.38 In this
case the OCR output includes <p> tags that correspond to single en-
tries of the indices. These entries have been extracted and manually
structured in their main components: main entry, subentries, descrip-
tions, notes and references to passages where entries and subentries

FHG I: praefatio (i–vii); FHG II: praefatio (i–iv); FHG IV: praefatio (i–iii); FHG V (pars prior):
praefatio (v–vi) and prolegomena (only vii–xxii: de codicibus); FHG V (pars altera): préface
(v–viii) and discours préliminaire (ix–xxxi). The other pages of the prolegomena of the first
part of FHG V (xxii–l: de fragmento Aristodemi; li–lv: Critobulus) have been inserted before
the corresponding parts about Aristodemus and Critobuls in the online version. FHG I–IV:
addenda et corrigenda (623–670 from volume IV); FHG V (pars prior): addenda (lvi–lxxi).
36
Hecataeus (ix–xvi), Charon (xvi–xx), Xanthus (xx–xxiii), Hellanicus (xxiii–xxxiii), Phere-
cydes (xxxiv–xxxvi), Acusilaus (xxxvi–xxxviii), Apollodorus (xxxviii–xlv), Antiochus (xlv),
Philistus (xlv–xlix), Timaeus (xlix–lvii), Ephorus (lvii–lxv), Theopompus (lxv–lxxvii) and
Phylarchus (lxxvii–lxxxi). The second part of the introduction is about the Atthidogra-
phers collected in the volume (De Atthidum scriptoribus: lxxxi–xci) and is arranged in two
subsections about authors’ lives (Clidemi, Phanodemi, Demonis, Androtionis, Philochori et
Istri vitae) and works (de operibus horum scriptorum): Clidemus (lxxxii and lxxxvi–lxxxvii),
Phanodemus (lxxxiii and lxxxvii), Demo (lxxxiii and lxxxvii–lxxxviii), Androtio (lxxxiii–
lxxxiv and lxxxviii), Philochorus (lxxxiv–lxxxv and lxxxviii–xc) and Ister (lxxxv and xc–
xci). The content of these pages including footnotes has been added in the DFHG at the
beginning of each relevant author of FHG I. Morevoer, each of the two subsections about
the Atthidographers is preceded by a short introduction that has been repeated at the be-
ginning of each Atthidographer’s section.

occur. The online version of both indices provides links to every pas-
sage and to cross entries. These indices are also accessible through
each fragment in the main page of the DFHG.39
2) FHG authors can be classified in three main categories:
a) Lost authors known through quotations and text reuses. Fragments
of these authors are extracted from source texts and, whener possible,
numbered by Müller according to their original belonging to works
that are now lost.40 Each fragment is preceded by an abbreviated ref-
erence to its source text and is sometimes followed by a short com-
mentary. Müller doesn’t provide a critical apparatus, but only transla-
tions into Latin (and in other cases into French) for Greek fragments.
In terms of layout, fragments are arranged in two columns with corre-
sponding columns for translations at the bottom of the page. Except
for very few examples, testimonia are not collected in a separate sec-
tion, but sometimes presented and discussed in the introduction to
the author.41
b) Authors known through manuscripts and other written objects. For
these authors Müller transcribes the text of manuscripts providing a
translation into Latin in a parallel column and extended critical com-
mentaries in footnotes. A special case of this category is represented
by the two inscriptions of the Parian Marble and the Rosetta Stone,
which are published in a separate appendix at the end of FHG I. Both
documents have separate introductions and extended commentaries,
and the text is presented with a translation in a parallel column.42
c) Still extant authors. This category is represented by the Bibliotheca of
Apollodorus printed in FHG I.43 The text is arranged in books, chap-
ters, and sections with two columns in each page for the Greek text
and its Latin translation.
Each of these categories presents complexities and special cases, but it is impor-
tant and interesting to note that Karl Müller was very consistent when planning
39
For a description of this functionality, see section 4.3.4.
40
Numbering depends on many different intepretations by the editor. This is the reason why
there are different numberings in different editions of the same fragment. On this issue,
cf. p. 84.
41
On the treatment of testimonia in the FHG and in other collections of fragmentary authors,
see p. 33 part. n. 81.
42
The Parian Marble also includes other four columns with corresponding chronologies of
the events mentioned in the chronicle. The final commentary (annotatio) is arranged by
events: (epochae). The French translation and the commentary of the Greek text of the
Rosetta Stone are arranged by lines of the inscription. See sections 4.5 and 4.6.
43
The difference with the previous category is due to the fact that in this case Müller publishes
the text without critical notes at the bottom of the page.

his collection and publishing it, especially if we consider that the FHG was con-
ceived and printed in thirty years of work in the second half of the 19th century.
The internal organization of the FHG has allowed to model a structure for
the whole collection and prepare an SQL database. Three main typologies (type)
have been identified for including paratextual elements and texts of authors of the
FHG: 1) intro for introductions, 2) fragment for texts of lost authors preserved
through quotations and text reuses, and 3) extant text for texts of still extant
authors.44 type is part of a database structure that includes a total of 28 fields for
the entire collection:
1. id: (integer) the primary key of the database that keeps track of the order
in which every text is published in the printed collection.45
2. volume: FHG volume name (Volumen primum, Volumen secundum, Vol-
umen tertium, Volumen quartum, Volumen quintum pars prior, Volumen
quintum pars altera).
3. sub_volume: internal divisions of FHG volumes from the second volume
onwards (e.g., LIBER PRIMUS of FHG II).46
4. sub_volume_note: descriptions provided by Müller about internal divisions
of FHG volumes.47
In this case the description in the DFHG includes
the entire text of the page that opens the relevant section.
For exam-
ple, FHG II 1 (LIBER PRIMUS): “INDE AB INCUNABULIS ARTIS HIS-
TORICAE AD FINEM BELLI PELOPONNESIACI. 520–404 A.C. NOMINA

in other cases, uppercase and lowercase letters are presented like in the
printed text of the FHG.

have names printed within round and square brackets.
FHG II: [DE-
MODAMAS HALICARNASSENSIS]. FHG IV: (ACHAEUS), (AGATHOS-
THENES), (HEGEMON ALEXANDRENSIS), (LEONIDES), (PAXAMUS) and
(PHILALIUS CORINTHIUS). Brackets are preserved in the DFHG database
and consequently in the DFHG main page and in the DFHG outputs.48
6. section: FHG author internal sections (e.g., PAMPHILAE EPIDAURIAE
FRAGMENTA: FHG III 520).49
7. work: titles of works of authors collected in the FHG (e.g., ΒΙΒΛΙΟΘΗΚΗΣ
of Apollodorus Atheniensis and ΠΕΡΙ ΠΟΙΗΤΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΜΟΥΣΙΚΩΝ of Glau-
cus Rheginus: FHG I 104 and II 23).50
8. work_note: commentaries about works of FHG authors (e.g., the note “Por-
phyrius ap. Eusebium in Pr. Ev. p. 467, D: Λυσιμάχου μέν ἐστι δύο (Βι-
βλία) Περὶτῆς Ἐφόρου κλοπῆς” about the work ΠΕΡΙ ΕΦΟΡΟΥ ΚΛΟΠΗΣ
of Lysimachus Alexandrinus: FHG III 342).
9. work_section: subdivisions of works of FHG authors (e.g., ΙΤΑΛΙΚΑ ΚΑΙ
ΣΙΚΕΛΙΚΑ of the ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑΙ of Timaeus and DE SOPHOCLE of the work
DE POETIS DRAMATICIS of Dicaearchus Messenius: FHG I 193 and II 247).
10. work_section_note:
commentaries and descriptions of subdivisions of
works of FHG authors (e.g., “Opus De Alcaeo, quantum e fragmentis colligi-
tur, commentarius erat in Alcaei carmina exegeticus criticusque. Praemissa
fuerit de vita et poesi Alcaei dissertatio” of the section ΠΕΡΙ ΑΛΚΑΙΟΥ of
the ΒΙΟΙ ΦΙΛΟΣΟΦΩΝ of Dicaearchus Messenius: FHG II 246).
11. book: book divisions of works of FHG authors (e.g., LIBER PRIMUS of the
ΓΕΝΕΑΛΟΓΙΑΙ of Hecataeus and ΒΙΒΛΙΟΝ Α of the Bibliotheca of Apol-
lodorus Atheniensis: FHG I 25 and 104).
12. book_note: commentaries and descriptions of book divisions of works of
FHG authors (e.g., Προυσίου συμπτώματα of the fourth book of the ΠΕΡΙ-
ΠΕΤΕΙΑΙ of Nicander Chalcedonius: FHG IV 462).
48
See sections 4.3.6 and 4.3.7).
49
Usually these forms are taken from the header of the FHG page belonging to the relevant
section.
50
In the first example, the genitive is due to the fact that the section with the Bibliotheca
of Apollodorus starts with ΑΠΟΛΛΟΔΩΡΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΑΘΗΝΑΙΟΥ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΙΚΟΥ ΒΙΒΛΙ-
ΟΘΗΚΗΣ ΒΙΒΛΙΟΝ Α (APOLLODORI ATHENIENSIS BIBLIOTHECAE LIBER PRIMUS),
which has been split into its components (section, work, and book). Greek titles have been
represented in the form given by Müller in the FHG. If not available, Latin translations
of titles provided by Müller have been used to produce the Greek form (e.g., ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑΙ of
Pherecydes in FHG I 70, where there is only the Latin form HISTORIARUM in the genitive
before the book number). And finally, if not present at all, they have been added in a Greek
form according to the principles of the collection (e.g., the ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑΙ of Ephorus in FHG I
234). The reason for adding in the DFHG information that is missing in the FHG is due to
the limits of the PHP visualization of the structure of the FHG in the main web page of the
project. On this aspect, see section 4.3.1.2.

150
4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
13. chapter: chapters of works of FHG authors (e.g., ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Γ of ΒΙ-
ΒΛΙΟΝ Α of the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus Atheniensis: FHG I 105).
14. section: sections of chapters of works of FHG authors (e.g., section 3 of
ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Β of ΒΙΒΛΙΟΝ Α of the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus Athenien-
sis and section XXXVIII of the fifteenth book of the ΠΕΡΙ ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΑΣ of
Memnon: FHG I 105 and III 545).
15. sub_section: subsections of works of FHG authors (e.g., subsection 3 of sec-
tion 1 of ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Β of ΒΙΒΛΙΟΝ Α of the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus
Atheniensis and subsection Z of section 7 of the ΠΕΡΙ ΤΩΝ ΕΝ ΠΑΙΔΕΙΑ
ΔΙΑΛΑΜΨΑΝΤΩΝ (ΣΟΦΩΝ) of the ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑ ΡΩΜΑΙΚΗ ΤΕ ΚΑΙ ΠΑΝ-
ΤΟΔΑΠΗ of Hesychius Mylesius: FHG I 105 and IV 165).
16. page: pages of the FHG printed volumes.
17. type: one of the three typologies of FHG texts presented above (intro,
fragment, and extant text).
18. sub_type: this field is for those parts where Müller adds commentaries
about further witnesses to FHG authors or addenda to FHG sections (e.g.,
the commentary about other possible fragments of Hellanicus after fr. 179
and the text “Fragm. 66, p. 207, b, lin. 12 in graecis post verba οὐπροσ-
ήρχοντο adde: οὔτε τοῦἱεροῦἐξήρχοντο; et in latinis pro nisi noctu lege:
neque templo nisi noctu egrediebantur” added at the end of the fragments
of Timaeus: FHG I 69 and 233).
19. fragment_number: numbers assigned by Müller to fragments of FHG authors
(e.g., fragment 3 of TIMAEI FRAGMENTA: FHG I 193).
20. fragment_letter: letters added by Müller to fragment numbers in order to
distinguish different witnesses of the same fragment (e.g., fragments 33a–
h of Pherecydes: FHG I 79–80). In this case Müller is not always consis-
tent and there are examples of fragments with more than one witness un-
der the same number but without disambiguating letters, like frr. 44 and
46 of Pherecydes (FHG I 83–84). In this case the DFHG keeps and rep-
resents FHG inconsistencies and doesn’t add letters that don’t appear in
the printed edition, even if this is not ideal for a computational database.
The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) includes fragments from the FHG and
generally adds letters to fragment numbers if they are missing. An interest-
ing example is fr. 1 of Apollodorus (FHG I 428). In this case Müller doesn’t
number the first witness of the work Περὶθεῶν at 428 (Photius Cod. CLXI),
but starts the numbering with the following two witnesses (Stephan. Byz.,
s.vv. Δωδώνη and Βωδώνη), which are numbered as fr. 1 of the first book
of the same work Περὶθεῶν. In this case, given that a fragment number
is necessary, the DFHG numbers Photius as fr. 1a and the two following

4.3 DFHG Tools
151
witnesses by Stephanus of Byzantium as fr. 1b.51
21. fragment_note: notes about fragments (e.g., the information Περὶἀνδριάν-
των καὶἀγαλμάτων printed before the text of fragment 45 of Hegesander
Delphus) and non-alphabetic characters that sometimes are added after the
number of the fragment to mean uncertainty, like parentheses (e.g., FHG I
56 fr. (83); FHG II 14 fr. (5) and 361 frr. (4) and (5)), square brackets (e.g.,
FHG II 29 fr. [2] and 34 fr. [22]), and question marks (e.g., FHG I 1 frr. 5
(?) and 7 (?)). FHG IV 421. Generally parentheses mean that Müller is not
sure about the attribution of a fragment to an author (reasons vary a lot),
square brackets are used by Müller to suggest the attribution of a fragment
to a certain author, and question marks indicate that the name of the frag-
mentary author is not mentioned by the source text, but that it’s possible
to propose an attribution to a certain author.52
22. witness: source texts of fragments (e.g., Athenaeus X 447, C as witness of
fragment 110 of Hellanicus: FHG I 59).53
23. text: actual text of paratextual elements, fragments, and extant texts of
FHG authors.
24. clean_text: it represents the text of the field text without punctuation and
with lowercase letters.
25. urn_text: each word of the text of the field clean_text is numbered with its
occurrence (e.g., “ἀκουσίλαος[1] ὁ[1] ἀργεῖος[1] ἐκ[1] καβείρης[1] καὶ[1]
ἡφαίστου[1] κάμιλον[1] λέγει[1] τοῦ[1] δὲ[1] τρεῖς[1] καβείρους[1] ὧν[1]
νύμφας[1] καβειράδας[1]” of fragment 6 of Acusilaus: FHG I 100). Num-
bering the occurrences of each word is essential for generating URNs of
DFHG texts (see section 4.3.5). The space between words is the delimiter
that transforms each text in an array of words. Words have lowercase let-
ters because in this way it is possible to detect equal words and number
their occurrences. Numbering words is computationally heavy and this is
the reason why the text is processed during the upload and the informa-
tion is stored in the database. clean_text and urn_text are two fields that
are preprocessed in order to speed up some capabilities, like the creation
of URNs in the visualization.54
51
The TLG adopts the same numbering, while in other cases it adds letters and also other
numbers, as for frr. 44 and 46 of Pherecydes (TLG frr. 44a–c and 46a–f) or for fr. 33a of
the same author (TLG frr. 33a1–3).

26. translation: translations of FHG texts into Latin or French.55
27. commentary: commentaries to fragments and texts of FHG authors (e.g., “Si-
tus incertus. Sed ibi Hecataeus etiam Phalannam videtur recensuisse, quae
ad borealem Penei ripam sita erat, cujus meminit in Historiis (fr. 333) ut
urbis Perrhaeborum. (Steph. Φάλαννα· Ἑκ. Ἱππίαν αὐτὴν καλεῖ)”, which
is a commentary to fragment 113 of Hecataeus: FHG I 8). This field is also
for critical notes about manuscripts, as for example FHG II vii.

Figures 4.8 and 4.9 show an example of the DFHG structured output of the frag-
ments of Timaeus of Tauromenium that has been semi-automatically generated

separators) have been produced for the texts of the fragments (structured output

As anticipated at p. 148, one of the three typologies that have been identified
for classifying texts of the collection of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum is
represented by extant text. This typology is used in the database of the DFHG to
label texts of the FHG that have to be distinguished by those preserved through
quotations and text reuses in other sources (type fragment). As we know, the term
fragmentum can be quite misleading and Classical scholarship has been debating
a lot about different possible classifications of fragmentary texts.58 In this case
the aim of the DFHG project is not to propose a new ontology for classifying
fragmentary texts, but to highlight characteristics of the method of Karl Müller,
who was able to collect many different kinds of historical fragmentary texts under
the heading fragmenta and to keep a relatively simple structure which is also
recognizable in the layout of the printed edition.
In this section, I list authors and works of the FHG that have been classified
as extant text in the database of the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum.
The following list is very interesting because it includes a significant group of
55
FHG V doesn’t include Syriac and Armenian texts, but only their French translations. For
experiments on automatic alignments of FHG texts with their translations, see Yousef/Berti
(2015) and Berti/Bizzoni et al. (2016).
56
In this example, the type is fragment.

historical sources transmitted by inscriptions, manuscripts and in the form of
extended excerpts. These sources, that in many cases have been collected and
published for the first time in the FHG, show the importance of the work of Karl
Müller in the field of Classical historiography between the 19th and the 20th cen-
tury, in spite of the strong criticism expressed by Felix Jacoby toward it:59
FHG I
– Apollodorus Atheniensis (104–179). The text of the Bibliotheca of Apol-
lodorus published by Müller is based on the reading of the archetypal
manuscript Parisinus Graecus 2722 (R), which is compared with the edition
of Christian Gottlob Heyne (1782–1783 and 1803).60
– Appendix
– Marmor Parium (542–555). Müller publishes only fragment A of the
Marmor Parium (ll. 1–93) on the basis of the edition by August Boeckh
(CIG 2374), because fragment B from Paros was discovered and pub-
lished in 1897: see FHG I vii and 535–541. The text is followed by
critical notes in the Annotatio (556–590). On the Digital Marmor Par-
ium project, see section 4.5.
– Marmor Rosettanum (1–6). The Greek text of the Rosetta Stone is pub-
lished by Jean-Antoine Letronne with his French translation: see FHG
I v–viii. Also in this case the text is followed by critical notes in the
Commentaire critique, historique et archéologique (7–42). On the Dig-
ital Rosetta Stone project, see section 4.6.
FHG II
– De insidiis quae regibus structae sunt excerpta
– Diodorus Siculus (vii–xxvi). Müller publishes excerpta of books VI,
VII, VIII, XXX–XL of the Historia of Diodorus Siculus from the Codex
Escurialensis Ω.I.11 (36324) (foll. 176r–187v) with critical notes.
– Polybius Megalopolitanus (xxvii–xxx). Müller publishes an excerptum
of book XV of the Historia of Polybius from the Codex Escurialensis
Ω.I.11 (36324) (foll. 188v–190v) with critical notes.
– Dionysius Halicarnassensis (xxxi–xlii). Müller publishes an excerp-
tum of book XII of the Historia of Dionysius Halicarnassensis from
the Codex Escurialensis Ω.I.11 (36324) (foll. 188r–v and 190v–196v)
with critical notes.

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
– Liber tertius
– Heraclides Ponticus (208–224). Müller publishes all the excerpta of
Aristoteles’ Politeiai attributed to Heraclides with critical notes and
an extended introduction, where he also describes eleven manuscripts
that preserve the excerpta and adds quotations of their descriptions
by Friedrich Wilhelm Schneidewin: Codex Parisinus 1657 (A), Codex
Leidensis (B), Codex Vaticanus 998 (C), Codex Parisinus 1693 (a), Codex
Parisinus 1694 (b), Codex Basiliensis F VI 29 (c), Codex Laurentianus LX
19 (d), Codex Laurentianus LXX (e), Codex Sluiscanus (f), Codex Am-
brosianus C 4 (g) and Codex Vaticanus 1375 (p): see FHG II 197–207.
For the publication of the text, Müller also relies on the editio princeps
by Camillo Peruschi (1545).61 Müller attributes the excerpta to Hera-
clides Ponticus, who is included in the section about Aristoteles and
his disciples in FHG II (101–339). Recent scholarship attributes the
exceperta of the Politeiai to Heraclides Lembus, whose fragments are
published by Müller in FHG III (167–171) in a section with authors
dated between 247 and 146 B.C.62
– Dicaearchus Messenius (254–264). Under the title Περὶτῶν ἐν Ἑλ-
λάδι πόλεων Müller publishes three excerpta (59, 60, and 61) with crit-
ical notes that are preserved by three manuscripts which were usu-
ally attributed to Dicaearchus: Codex Parisinus Suppl. Gr. 443, Codex
Parisinus Graecus 571, and the so called Codex Gudianus: see FHG II
227.63 The other FHG fragments of Dicaearchus are quotations and
text reuses preserved in extant sources (type fragment).
FHG III
– Liber septimus
– Nicolaus Damascenus (348–464). Some of the fragmenta of Nicolaus
in FHG III (frr. 3–10, 12, 14–21, 24, 27, 28, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 41, 43, 49–
70, 99–101) are excerpta from the Constantinian Excerpta de insidiis
and Excerpta de virtutibus et vitiis that Müller publishes with critical
notes from the Codex Escurialensis Ω I.11 and the Codex Turonensis C
980.64
– Memnon (526–558). Books 9–16 of the ΠερὶἩρακλείας of Memnon of
Heraclea have been transmitted as an extended summary by Photius
61
For a description of the entire manuscript tradition of Heraclides’ Politeiai, see Dilts (1965).
62
See Bloch (1940) and Dilts (1971) 8. This is the reason why the DFHG Witnesses Cata-
log (section 4.4.2) includes the FHG author Heraclides Ponticus under the witness author
Heraclides Lembus.

in the Bibliotheca. Müller doesn’t present the epitome of Memnon as a
numbered fragment, but follows the structure of other extant sources
with the Latin translation in a parallel column and detailed critical
notes at the bottom of the page.65
– Liber octavus
– Phlegon Trallianus (603–604 and 608–624). Some of the FHG frag-
ments of Phlegon Trallianus (frr. 1 and 29–64) are excerpta of his
works from the Codex Palatinus Graecus 398. The other FHG frag-
ments of Phlegon are quotations and text reuses preserved in extant
sources (type fragment).66
– Porphyrius Tyrius (689–702, 706–707, 711–717, 719–725). Müller pub-
lishes the excerpta of the Chronica of Porphyrius from Eusebius and
Georgius Syncellus with the same structure of other fragments that
have been classified as extant text, which means that the original
text has a parallel column with the Latin translation and extended
critical notes at the bottom of the page.67
FHG IV
– Liber nonus
– Hesychius Milesius (146–177). FHG fr. 4 of Hesychius is the excerp-
tum of the work Πάτρια Κωνσταντινουπόλεως preserved in the Codex
Palatinus Graecus 398.68 FHG fr. 7 is the text of a libellus entitled Περὶ
τῶν ἐν παιδείᾳδιαλαμψάντων σοφῶν, which is preserved by a few
manuscripts and originally attributed to Hesychius of Miletus. Müller
publishes the text with critical notes that include parallel biographical
entries from the Suda and other sources. After the edition by Johann
Konrad Orelli (1820), which was consulted by Müller (FHG IV 143–
145), the libellus was edited by Johannes Flach (Hesychii Milesii qui
fertur De viris illustribus librum, 1880), who considered the text spu-
rious and two years later published a complete reconstruction of the
original work of Hesychius (Hesychii Milesii Onomatologi quae super-
sunt, 1882).69
– Joannes Epiphaniensis (273–276). The FHG excerptum of the Historiae
of Joannes Epiphaniensis is preserved in the Codex Vaticanus Graecus
1065. Müller relies on the text edited by Karl Benedikt Hase at the
end of the edition of the History of Leo the Deacon (1819, 171–176):

see FHG IV 272.
– Appendix ad librum nonum
– Joannes Antiochenus (538–622).
Müller publishes the excerpta of
Joannes Antiochenus from the Excerpta Constantiniana, the Excerpta
Salmasiana, and from passages of the Codex Parisinus Graecus 1630.
Other fragments are text reuses from the Suda, Tzetzes, and Georgius
Codinus. The excerpta are published without Latin translations and
with extended critical notes at the bottom of the page. In FHG V (pars
prior 27–39) Müller added other excerpta of Joannes Antiochenus from
the Codex Escurialensis Ω.I.11.70
FHG V
The first part of FHG V (pars prior) collects Greek authors whose works are
published by Müller on the basis of recently discovered manuscripts.
– Aristodemus (1–20). The excerptum of Aristodemus is published by Müller
with extended critical notes from the Codex Parisinus Suppl. Gr. 607 (foll.
83v–87v). Characteristics and content of the manuscript are extensively
described in the prolegomena of FHG V (vii–xiv).71
– Eusebius (21–23). The two excerpta of Eusebius are published by Müller
with critical notes from different folia of the Codex Parisinus Suppl. Gr. 607
(foll. 17, 103v).72
– Priscus (24–26). The two excerpta of Priscus are published by Müller with
critical notes from the Codex Parisinus Suppl. Gr. 607 (foll. 93v–94v).
– Joannes Antiochenus (27–39). These excerpta are from the Codex Escuri-
alensis Ω.I.11.73
– Joannes Malala (38–39).
Müller publishes an excerptum of the Chrono-
graphia of Joannes Malala found in the Codex Escurialensis Ω.I.11 after the
text of Joannes Antiochenus.74
– Critobulus (52–161). The five books of De rebus gestis Mechemetis have been

published by Müller with critical notes from the Codex Constantinopolitanus
Seragliensis G.İ. 3. The text of the Epistula is also known from the Codex
Tischendorf. Both manuscripts are described in the prolegomena of FHG V
(xiv–xvi).75
– Photius (162–173). Müller publishes the text of two Homiliae of Photius
about the Rus’ siege of Constantinopolis (865 CE) from the Codex Athous
(Monê Ibêrôn), which is described in the prolegomena of FHG V (xvi) relying
on the edition of August Nauck (1867, 201–232).
– Anonymus (174–184). Müller publishes the text of chapter XLII (pars me-
dia) of the Anonymi Periplus Ponti Euxini from the Codex Londiniensis Musei
Britannici 19391. The manuscript is described in the prolegomena of FHG
V (xvi–xix). The other two parts of the Periplus, which are known from
the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 143 and the Codex Palatinus Graecus 398, are
published by Müller in the Geographi Graeci Minores (I 402–423): cf. FHG
V, xix–xx.76
– Dionysius Byzantius (188–190). Müller publishes the last part of the text
of the Anaplus Bospori of Dionysius Byzantius from the Codex Londiniensis
Musei Britannici 19391. The author is already published in the Geographi
Graeci Minores (II 1–101) with the surviving Latin paraphrase by Petrus
Gyllius.
The second part of FHG V (pars altera) has been curated by Victor Langlois
and collects French translations of Armenian historical sources that derive from
Greek and Syriac works. This section of FHG V is part of a bigger project of Lan-
glois, who published two volumes of a collection of historians of Armenia thanks
to the support of the editor Firmin Didot.77 The first volume of this collection
corresponds to the second part of the fifth volume of the Fragmenta Historico-
rum Graecorum, to which was added as a “complément” (FHG V, pars altera vii).
Greek texts published in this part of the FHG were reviewed by Johann Friedrich
Dübner. The project of Langlois and the idea of including part of it in the new
collection of the FHG have to be understood as a consequence of the great im-
pulse given to the Armenian studies in Europe by the move of the congregation
of the Mekhitarists to the island of Saint Lazarus in Venice in 1715 (FHG V, pars
altera v). The goal of Langlois was to publish authors who were for the most part
still unedited and never translated into a European language.78 Langlois individ-
uates historians who originally wrote in Syriac and/or Greek and whose works
have been preserved through their translations into Armenian (1 and 2), and lost

Greek historians known through references and extracts in Armenian authors
(3).79 The first two groups (1 and 2) include the following authors (1: Historiens
grecs traduit en arménien; 2: Historiens syriens traduit en arménien):
– Le Pseudo-Bardesane. Langlois publishes the French translation of the sur-
viving Book of the Laws of Countries (Le livre de la loi des contreées) by Bar-
daisan, which is preserved in a Syriac manuscript of the British Library
(Add MS 14658). Langlois attributes this work to a disciple of Bardaisan
(le Pseudo-Bardesane: FHG V, parsa altera 73–94). The French translation
is based on the Syriac text and Langlois relies on the edition by Cureton
(1855), which is now available online at http://syri.ac/bardaisan and which
also contains a small fragment of a work on the revolution of the stars that
Langlois publishes with the title Traité sur les révolutions des astres (95).80
– Agathange. The French translation of the surviving Armenian version of
the History of Agathangelos is published for the first time by Langlois, who
also adds the Greek version of it with the Latin translation by P. Johannes
Stilting: see FHG V, pars altera 105–194. The translation is based on the
Mekhitarist edition published in Venice in 1835 (FHG V, pars altera 101–
102).81
– Faustus de Byzance. Jean-Baptiste Émine publishes the first French trans-
lation of the Armenian version of the work of Faustus of Byzantium con-
sidering it what remains of the lost original Greek version: see FHG V, pars
altera 209–310. The French title is Bibliothèque historique and the transla-

See FHG V, pars altera vii (préface) and ix–xxxi (discours préliminaire), where Langlois
discusses the strong influence of the Syriac and Greek languages on Armenian translations.

in particular and on Armenian historiography in general, see Hacikyan/Basmajian et al.
(2000) 117–148 and Thomson (2014). Langlois also publishes the French translation of an
Armenian excerpt (extrait) of a history of the Armenia of the origins preserved in a work
attributed to Sebeos (Le Pseudo-Agathange. Histoire ancienne de l’Arménie 195–200): on
this text see Hewson (1975).

tion has been performed on the edition published in Venice in 1832.82
– Léroubna d’Édesse. Jean-Raphaël Émine publishes with critical notes the
first French translation of an Armenian text preserving the Letter of Abgar
(Bibl. Imp. Paris arm. 88 – Martyrologe, foll. 112v–126v). Victor Langlois
accepts the attribution of the text to Lerubna of Edessa and considers it
what remains of a lost original Syriac version: see FHG V, pars altera 315–
316 and 317–325.
– Zénob de Glag and Jean Mamigonien. Jean-Raphaël Émine publishes also
a French translation of the Armenian version of the History of Taron of
Zenob of Glak and the first French translation of its continuation by John
Mamikonyan: see FHG V, pars altera 337–355 and 361–382. The transla-
tions have been performed on two critical editions donated to Venice by
the Mekhitarists of Saint Lazarus (FHG V, pars altera 336 and 360).83
The third group (3) includes the following authors (3: Fragments d’historiens grecs
perdu, conservés dans les œuvres des historiens arméniens):
– Moïse de Khorène. Victor Langlois publishes the French translation of ex-
cerpts of the Armenian text of the History of Armenia of Moses of Khoren
where the author refers to Greek authors consulted for his own historical
research: see FHG V, pars altera 386–398. Extracts of the work of Moses are
also published at 13–53 under a section about Mar Apas Catina, who is iden-
tified by Langlois as author of a work extensilvely summarized by Moses.
Langlois individuates 24 Greek historians whose fragments are preserved
in the work of Moses (FHG V, pars altera 386: “Bérose, Alexandre Polyhis-
tor, Abydène, Josèphe, Manéthon, Céphalion, S. Épiphane de Constance,
Gorgias? (Korki), Panan, David, Olympiodore, Jules l’Africain, Hippolyte,
Polycrate, Évagoras, Camadrus, Phlégon de Tralles, Olympius d’Ani, Aris-
ton de Pella, Paléphate, Porphyre, Philémon, Khorohpoud (vulgo Éléazar),
Firmilien de Césarée”).84

A Master dissertation (MA) on Faustus of Byzantium has been written and defended by Uta
Koschmieder under my supervision at the Martin-Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg

a new English translation with commentary of the original Armenian text of Faustus, see
Garsoïan (1989), who entitles it The Epic Histories and shows that the work was originally
written in Armenian and not in Greek. On the necessity of a new critical edition of this
author, see Thomson (2014) 305.

– Le Pseudo-Callisthènes.
Langlois includes also a short commentary to
the Armenian translation of the Greek history of Alexander by Pseudo-
Callisthenes referring to the Mekhitarist edition published in Venice in
1842: see FHG V, pars altera 399.85
– Gregoire Magistros Duc de la Mesopotamie. Langlois publishes the French
translation of a short extract of a letter of Grigor Magistros where he refers
to his own translations of Greek and Syriac authors: see FHG V, pars altera
401–403. Langlois mentions the fact that the works of Grigor were pre-
served in the library of the Mekhitarists in Venice and in other collections
and still needed to be published.86
– Saint Epiphane, évêque de Salamine en Chypre. Langlois publishes the
French translation of two texts that preserve the Armenian and the Syriac
version of two fragments of the Treatise on Weights and Measures (Περὶ
μέτρων καὶσταθμῶν) of Epiphanius of Salamis: see FHG V, pars altera
405–408.87
4.3.1.2 Visualization
The DFHG is first of all a structured database of the contents of the Fragmenta
Historicorum Graecorum that can be exported to different formats.88 Experiments
have been carried out to navigate the data of the collection in dynamic HTML
pages.89 As a result, the DFHG appears as an Ajax web page automatically gen-
erated by a PHP script that queries the SQL database of the project.90 Using ad-
vanced techniques like asynchronous loading and AJAX, it is possible to load,
visualize, and navigate the entire content of the FHG in one single HTML page
in order to facilitate the usability of a very large collection.91 AJAX web pages
use client computation capabilities to render the page and provide the majority of

the services without reloading the web page and minimizing data transfer effort.
This computational delegation allows the DFHG to avoid the usage of an expen-
sive server infrastructure. The life cycle of each DFHG page is constituted by
the asynchronous download of many minimized HTML codes that are generated
(server-side) by PHP scripts querying the DFHG database. These HTML codes
are then unpacked and displayed in the correct order (client-side) by JavaScript
functions. DFHG content is downloaded asynchronously by FHG authors, so that
all HTML codes representing FHG author sections are requested at the same time,
become asynchronously available to the client, and are placed in the correct po-
sition of the page thanks to JavaScript functions.

The goal of the visualization is not to replicate the printed edition of the FHG in
a digital environment, but to improve its accessibility by offering services that
are not available in the printed format. Examples are the slide in/out navigation
menu, which represents the whole structure of the FHG with links to each of its
sections down to the fragment level, and the main page, which arranges in parallel
columns all the elements of the sources edited and collected in the FHG.
This visualization provides scholars with a possible solution for accessing
and navigating digital editions of historical fragmentary texts that intend to fol-
low the traditional model of collecting quotations and text reuses by extracting
chunks of texts (fragmenta) from their context. According to this model, a digital
collection of textual fragments (fragmenta) becomes a structured database where
it is possible to store source texts that preserve quotations and reuses of other
texts.
In this regard, the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum project has
been also presented in an exhibition as part of a workshop entitled The World in
Pieces: Fragments and the Fragmentary, that was organized by Matthew Payne and

printed and the digital version of the collection. Figure 4.10 shows a picture taken
at the exhibition where it was possible to see the volume of FHG II opened at pages
362–363 together with the tablet that displayed the corresponding section of the
DFHG main page about Demetrius Phalereus.93
4.3.2 Digger
È The DFHG Digger is a tool for browsing authors and works collected in the
Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum. This tool filters FHG data according to au-
thors, works, work sections and book numbers.94 By typing and selecting through
a live search, users can display the desired part of the collection.
Search Fields are: Author (e.g., Antiochus); Work (e.g., Atthis); Work Section
(e.g., ΑΘΗΝΑΙΩΝ: work section of Aristoteles’ ΠΟΛΙΤΕΙΑΙ); Book number (e.g.,
E LIBRO VICESIMO TERTIO: book 23 of the Historiae of Duris Samius and of
Posidonius Apamensis). It is possible to combine filters using logical AND/OR ex-
pressions to get a more precise selection. For example: CHARON (author) AND
ΠΕΡΣΙΚΑ (work); DEMO (author) OR ISTER (author).
For each query the output displays introductions to FHG authors and frag-
ments arranged by authors and works within FHG volumes and subvolumes. It
is also possible to search DFHG authors whose sections in the FHG don’t include
numbered fragments but only commentaries, as for example Cadmus Milesius
and Mnesiptolemus.95 As already mentioned in the previous sections, Greek and
Latin forms of authors, works, work sections and book numbers are those origi-
nally used by the editors in the printed edition of the FHG.
92
Other objects collected in the exhibition were manuscripts, papyri, and waxed tablets that
were chosen to show different examples of physical fragments of historical documents and
text reuses preserved on them.

4.3.3 Search
D DFHG contents (introductions, fragments, translations, commentaries and
source texts) are searchable in two different ways: 1) by holding down the SHIFT-
key when highlighting words with the mouse in the DFHG main page of the en-
tire collection or of a single volume; 2) by searching words directly in the search
tool.96 The search is performed on fragments, translations, commentaries and
source texts. Results show the number of occurrences in each DFHG author and
are organized by authors and works, and searched words are highlighted in the
texts of the DFHG. When available, results display also inflected forms and lem-
mata through Morpheus, the Suda On Line, and the Liddell-Scott Lexicon in the
CITE Architecture.97
4.3.4 Integration
Ŷ One of the main goals of the DFHG project is to integrate the Fragmenta His-
toricorum Graecorum with internal and external resources such as textual collec-
tions, authority lists, indices, dictionaries, lexica and gazetteers. These resources
are available through the DFHG main page and the DFHG search tool.
Promoting the usage of a network of interconnected resources developed
and maintained by different research groups and avoiding the creation of the same
functionalities inside the DFHG project are a strong encouragement to rethink the
way technical infrustructures in the digital humanities are growing. The goal is to
support service interaction instead of raw data publication, so that the community
doesn’t have to loose time recoding services that are already available and can
isolate useless monolythic client resources. The DFHG main page is currently
connected to the printed edition of the FHG available through Google Books, to
the 8427 entries of the Index Nominum et Rerum (FHG I), to the 249 entries of
the Index Marmoris Rosettani (FHG I), and to the OpenNLP POSTagger for Ancient
Greek. The first three resources allow users to compare the digital version and
the printed edition of the FHG by visualizing the original pages of the volumes
and by consulting the entries of each source text that have been collected by
Karl Müller and Jean-Antoine Letronne in the two indices of FHG I. The digital
versions of these indices provide links to other entries and their contexts.98 The
OpenNLP POSTagger for Ancient Greek is trained on the Ancient Greek Dependency
Treebank 2.0 and automatically parses the text of each Greek source of the FHG

in order to obtain the corresponding Part-of-Speech (POS) tag of each token.99
These resources can be consulted by clicking the page number and the two icons
f and c under each fragment number in the DFHG main page, as it is visible in
the example of figure 4.11.
The DFHG search tool is currently connected to the corresponding fragment
in the DFHG main page, to Morpheus, to the Suda On Line, and to the Liddell-Scott
Lexicon in the CITE Architecture. As described at p. 165, the DFHG search tool
displays results by showing the number of occurrences in each DFHG author and
by visualizing fragments and passages according to authors and works. Links to
each fragment and to each source text allow users to move from the search tool to
the main page in order to visualize each result in its relevant section within the
DFHG collection.

Morpheus is the open parsing and lemmatising tool of the Perseus Project that
returns the lemma (or multiple possible lemmata) of each token and a full mor-
phological breakdown of the form.100 The project provides a morphology service
API to access the resource. Due to the amount of data, the DFHG doesn’t inter-
rogate it on the fly, but has created a cached thesaurus of Morpheus’ entries in its
database in order to speed up the morphological analysis process which is avail-
able in the search tool. Given the complexities of an inflected language like ancient
Greek and the fact that Perseus doesn’t cover the entire corpus of Greek literature,
Morpheus still needs to perform additions, corrections, and disambiguations of its
entries.
Other projects have been addressing this task in the last years, as for ex-
ample the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) and Logeion. As reported on the
TLG website, “the TLG Lemmatization Project Work on lemmatization began in
2003 and benefited from access to software known as Morpheus developed by
the Perseus Project. Morpheus was designed to deal effectively with a relatively
narrow, well-documented cross section of the Greek language, i.e. the classi-
cal canon, meaning Epic and Attic Greek with some Doric, Ionic, and Koine
forms. The TLG corpus encompasses the totality of Greek literature, including
Early Modern Greek, and Byzantine texts. As a result, lemmatization of the TLG

corpus required a different philosophy and a significantly more complex archi-
tecture, which combines lexical and morphological databases, and extensive pro-
gramming in order to increase parses and achieve higher and more accurate form
recognition. At the time of its first release in December 2006, the TLG lemma-
tizer recognized approximately 88% of the unique wordforms in the TLG cor-
pus.”101 According to the same web page, at the end of February 2019 automatic
lemma recognition of the TLG was “up to 98.362%.” Inflected forms of the TLG
can be automatically linked through their URLs, but they require an individual
or institutional subscription in order to be accessed and consulted for getting the
corresponding lemmata and morphologycal analyses. Therefore, TLG data can’t
be directly accessed and exported to be used to perform automatic lemmatization
and morphological analysis of other textual collections.
Logeion was developed “to provide simultaneous lookup of entries in the
many reference works that make up the Perseus Classical collection.” The project
has been developing morphological analysis tools and ingests data from different
dictionaries of ancient Greek. The resource is open, but doesn’t provide an API
to access its database and lemmata are only available through a web interface.102
Future work of the DFHG project will query data from the Lemmatized Ancient
Greek XML corpus that includes, beside Perseus, Open Greek and Latin (OGL) texts
and is based not only on Morpheus but also on PerseusUnderPhiloLogic.103
Suda On Line (SOL) is a collaborative online project that offers English trans-
lations and annotations of the more than 31,000 entries of the Byzantine lexi-
con Suda.104 The integration of this resource with the DFHG is due to the im-
portance of the Suda as a source of quotations and text reuses of lost histori-
cal texts.105 Thanks to the automatic lemmatization of the Greek texts of the
DFHG and to a complete list of Suda’s headwords with corresponding URLs of
the Suda On Line, the DFHG search tool is able to automatically detect if lem-
mata of inflected forms of FHG texts correspond to Suda’s entries.106 An exam-
ple are the 19 FHG occurrences of the form Ἑκαταίῳ, whose lemma Ἑκαταῖος
correponds to two different entries in the Suda about Hecataeus of Abdera and

103 See https://github.com/gcelano/LemmatizedAncientGreekXML and http://perseus.uchi

ancient Greek are The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) and Diorisis: Burns (2019) 166–
168; Vatri/McGillivray (2018); Vatri/McGillivray (2020).

Hecataeus of Miletus, who are both authors collected in the FHG:107 Ε 359 s.v.
Ἑκαταῖος (http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/epsilon/359) and Ε 360 s.v. Ἑκα-
ταῖος (http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/epsilon/360). In this case the two en-
tries are quoted in the FHG in the introductions to Hecataeus (FHG I IX notes
1 and 3) and to Hecataeus Abderita (FHG II 384), but not as separate testimo-
nia or fragmenta.108 Other examples are the 26 FHG occurrences of the form
Τίμαιον, whose lemma Τίμαιος corresponds to three entries in the Suda: Τ 600
s.v. Τίμαιος (http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/epsilon/600), Τ 601 s.v. Τί-
μαιος (http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/epsilon/601), and Τ 602 s.v. Τίμαιος
(http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/epsilon/602). Part of the text of the entries 600
and 602 is quoted in the introduction to Timaeus (FHG I, xlix n. 1) in a discussion
about the identification of Timaeus Tauromenita.109
Future developments of the DFHG will also include data from Harpokra-
tion On Line (HOL) and Photios On Line (PhoOL), as soon as these projects will
have completed the translation of the entries of the Lexicon of the Ten Orators
of Harpocration and of the Lexicon of Photius.110 The integration with all these
resources is important not only because these encyplopedias and lexica preserve
many references to historical texts, but also because the integration itself is funda-
mental to improve data and expand interchanges among collections in the spirit
of Linked Open Data (LOD).
The Liddell-Scott Lexicon in the CITE Architecture is a resource that has been
recently implemented to provide access to the 116,502 entries of the LSJ as a CITE
Collection with the data for each entry formatted in Markdown.111 Thanks to the
lemmatization of the DFHG texts performed with Morpheus, the DFHG search
tool is able to detect if lemmata of FHG inflected forms correspond to LSJ entries.
An example are the 7 FHG occurrences of the inflected form συγγραφῇ, which
corresponds to three lemmata: συγγραφεύς,112 συγγραφή,113 and συγγράφω.114
These URNs are expressed according to the CITE Architecture and provide unique
107 In this example and in the following one the number of occurrences takes into account
only the occurrences in the ancient sources of the FHG and not the Greek forms cited in
the commentaries of the FHG, that are included in the results of the DFHG search tool. This
is the reason why a query in the DFHG gives a different number.
108 Both entries are testimonia in FGrHist (BNJ) 1 and 264.
109 Entry 602 is a testimonium in FGrHist (BNJ) 566.
110 See https://github.com/dcthree/harpokration and https://github.com/dcthree/photios.
111 The resource is available at http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/. For a technical discussion about
its implementation within the CITE Architecture, see Blackwell/Smith (2019). The digital
version of the LSJ is the 1940 edition of the Greek–English Lexicon of Henry George Liddell
and Robert Scott revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones. On various aspects of the
complex history and methodology of the LSJ, see now Stray/Clarke et al. (2019).

identifiers for the three lemmata of συγγραφῇ.115 A URL prefix make these URNs
web resolvable and linkable through the DFHG search tool.
The reason for integrating the database of the DFHG with all these resources
dipends on different questions: 1) the FHG is a rich collection of historical sources
about many different aspects of Classical antiquity, whose language is constituted
by significant Greek words that still need to be annotated and lemmatized;116
2) the integration with dictionaries, lexica, and encyclopedias allows to disam-
biguate and understand the language of the sources of the FHG; 3) on the other
side, the language of the FHG permits to enrich external linguistic resources that
still miss many ancient Greek words; 4) from a computational point of view, these
experiments are also fundamental to improve standardization and portability in
accordance with the principles of Linked Open Data about the ancient world.117
4.3.5 Data Citation
Đ Data citation is a computational problem that concerns many fields includ-
ing Digital Classical Philology.118 As discussed in section 3.2, the community of
Digital Classics has been addressing the problem and one solution is the CITE Ar-
chitecture, which provides stable, unique, and canonical identifiers for historical
resources.
A fundamental part of the DFHG project has been devoted to this problem,
considering also that in this case the object of citation is a critical edition produced
in the 19th century for the technology of the printed book. The collection of
the FHG doesn’t have author numbers as in the case of the FGrHist.119 FHG
authors are usually cited by referring to their names followed by a reference to
the FHG volume number. Given that authors don’t have numbers, FHG fragment
numbers are usually cited by referring also to the page number of the relevant
FHG volume. For example, fragment 1 of Strabo Amasensis can be cited as “FHG
III 491 fr. 1.” As I described in section 4.3.1, the digital version of the FHG is a
textual database arranged according to fields that fully respect the organization
of the printed collection by volumes, fragmentary authors, fragmentary works,
115 Results of the Liddell-Scott Lexicon in the CITE Architecture in the DFHG search tool show
also inflected forms. This is the reason why, searching συγγραφῇ, the DFHG search tool
returns this form in the entries of the Liddell-Scott Lexicon in the CITE Architecture.

dography, see Berti (2009b) 1–27.

and fragments. This arrangement can be visualized in the navigation menu of
the DFHG main page (fig. 4.4). Each menu element of the DFHG main page
has a unique identifier expressed as a URN. The syntax of each URN represents
the editorial work of Karl Müller, who arranged fragments in a sequence and
attributed them to fragmentary authors, works, work sections and book numbers.
The following examples show different levels of granularity of these URNs, that
are used to identify and cite fragmentary authors and works down to the fragment
level:
– urn:lofts:fhg.1.hecataeus identifies the author Hecataeus in FHG I;
– urn:lofts:fhg.1.hecataeus.hecataei_fragmenta identifies the whole sec-
tion of Hecataeus’ fragments in FHG I;
– urn:lofts:fhg.1.hecataeus.hecataei_fragmenta.genealogiae
identifies Hecataeus’ Γενεαλογίαι in FHG I;
– urn:lofts:fhg.1.hecataeus.hecataei_fragmenta.genealogiae.liber_secu
ndus identifies the second book of Hecataeus’ Γενεαλογίαι in FHG I;
– urn:lofts:fhg.1.hecataeus.hecataei_fragmenta.genealogiae.liber_secu
ndus:350 identifies fragment 350 of the second book of Hecataeus’
Γενεαολογίαι in FHG I.
A URN identifies itself as a uniform resource name in the LOFTS domain,
whose acronym stands for Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series (LOFTS)
that represents the domain of textual fragments.120
Work titles, work sec-
tions, books and chapters in the URN are expressed in the Latin translation
provided by Müller in the FHG.121 URNs are combined with a URL prefix
(http://www.dfhg-project.org/DFHG/#) to generate stable links. URNs are not
stored in the database, but are generated with the PHP script that creates HTML
pages of the DFHG content and are used as unique identifiers of the different
HTML tags that represent the entire structure of the FHG. The structure allows to
reach every part of the collection without realoading the page not only if we select
a menu element, but also if we use a link containing an anchor with a URN (e.g.,
#urn:lofts:fhg.1.hecataeus.hecataei_fragmenta.genealogiae.liber_secundus:
350).
By using URN identifiers, it is possible to export citations of DFHG frag-
ments and source texts down to the word level. By selecting a portion of text in
the DFHG main page and holding down the ALT-key, users get a pop-up window
with the URN that identifies the selected chunk of text. For example:
120 Berti/Almas et al. (2016); Berti (2018); Berti (2019c).
121 On these translations, see p. 149 n. 50.

relevant URNs. The pop-up window containing the URN is created on the fly via

from the identifier of the parent HTML tag containing the text of fragments and
source texts. The substring of the URN that identifies the word or the range of
words selected by the user is created via AJAX analyzing the HTML tags that
contain the first and the last word of the selected portion of text (cf. p. 151 n. 54).

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
The DFHG provides also a URN Retriever, which is a tool for retrieving
and citing passages and words in the fragments by typing their corresponding
URNs.122 For example:
– Hellanicus’ fragment 1 corresponds to
urn:lofts:fhg.1.hellanicus.hellanici_fragmenta.phoronis:1
– the beginning of Hellanicus’ fragment 1 (Ἑλλάνικος ὁΛέσβιος τοὺς
Τυῤῥηνούς φησι, Πελασγοὺς πρότερον καλουμένους, ἐπειδὴκατῴκησαν
ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ, παραλαβεῖν ἣν ἔχουσι προσηγορίαν) corresponds to
urn:lofts:fhg.1.hellanicus.hellanici_fragmenta.phoronis:1@ἑλλάνικος
[1]–προσηγορίαν[1]
In the second example, the DFHG URN Retriever highlights the portion of text
corresponding to the URN (fig. 4.14). A well known problem of the FHG is
that the editor was not always consistent with fragment numbers and there are
examples of fragments with more than one withness under the same number
but without disambiguating letters.
The DFHG maintains and represents
these inconsistencies, even if they are not ideal from a computational point
of view, and the DFHG URN Retriever works accordingly.123
For example,
Pherecydes’ fragment 44 in FHG I corresponds to three source texts. By typing
urn:lofts:fhg.1.pherecydes.pherecydis_fragmenta.historiai.liber_quintus:44,
the
DFHG URN Retriever returns as a result the three corresponding source texts
(fig. 4.15).
As far as author names are concerned, the FHG includes 5 cases of authors
who are homonymous but not edited in the same volume: Anonymus (FHG III
654–655; FHG V.1 174–187),124 Antiochus (FHG I 181–184; FHG IV 306), Eusebius
(FHG III 728; FHG V.1 21–23),125 Nicomachus (FHG III 664; FHG IV 465), and Theo-
cles (FHG III 665; FHG IV 512). The sixth case is the name Joannes Antiochenus,
who corresponds to the same author whose fragments are published in two dif-
ferent sections in FHG IV (535–622) and FHG V.1 (27–38). The inclusion of the
number of the FHG volume in the URN syntax avoids conflicting identifiers (e.g.,
urn:lofts:fhg.3.theocles and urn:lofts:fhg.4.theocles). The following FHG
authors are homonymous, but their headings include attributes to disambiguate
their identity:
122 http://www.dfhg-project.org/DFHG/urn_retriever.php
123 See p. 151 n. 51.
124 The second author in the FHG has the heading Anonymi Periplus Ponti Euxini. In this case,
the work title has been separated from the author name to fill in both fields in the DFHG
database.
125 Sources about this author are edited together in BNJ 101.

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
The DFHG project provides also CITE URNs of FHG authors according to
the guidelines of the CITE Architecture.
The syntax of these URNs is differ-
ent because they don’t represent the whole structure of the FHG, but only the
elements of traditional citations of FHG fragments. For example, Ephorus is
identified as urn:cite:lofts:fhg.1.ephorus and Ephorus fr. 1 is identified as
urn:cite:lofts:fhg.1.ephorus:1. CITE URNs are accessible through the DFHG
API, the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog, and the Müller-Jacoby Table of Con-
cordance.126
4.3.6 Web API
® In order to allow users to access data about the fragmenta of the FHG, the
project has implemented a Web API that can be queried by combining an author
name (author), a fragment number (fragment), and a volume name (volume):127
api.php?author=<author name>&fragment=<fragment number>&volume=<volume name>
The result of the query is a JSON that displays 27 key/value pairs, whose keys
contain data from 25 fields of the DFHG database with the addition of 2 keys for
URNs and CITE URNs of FHG texts.128 I present here five examples:
1) Acusilaus, fragment 10.
The query is api.php?author=ACUSILAUS&fragment=10 and generates the following
JSON object:
[
{
"volume": "Volumen primum",
"sub_volume": "",
"sub_volume_note": "",
"author": "ACUSILAUS",
"section": "ACUSILAI FRAGMENTA",
"work": "ΓΕΝΕΑΛΟΓΙΑΙ",
"work_note": "",
126 See sections 4.3.6, 4.4.1, and 4.4.3.
127 The DFHG Web API usage web page is available at http://www.dfhg-project.org/DFHG/ap
i.php. The author key is mandatory, while fragment and volume are optional. The web page
includes the list of authors who are accessible through the API and who are accompanied by
volume names (e.g., Volumen secundum) in order to disambiguate homonyms (see below).
There are 7 authors in the FHG whose names are printed within round and square brackets
(see p. 149 n. 48). Brackets are preserved in the DFHG database and consequently in the
Web API and in the list in the usage web page. Brackets are necessary in an API query in
order to get a JSON object.
128 For the description of the fields of the DFHG database, see pp. 148 ff. On identifiers of FHG
texts expressed in the form of URNs and CITE URNs, see p. 176.

not displayed in the JSON object because it is classified as extant text in the database
(see section 4.3.1.1). This is the reason why the JSON shows only the fragments of the
Bibliotheca that are classified as fragment (see below).

is the query api.php?author=PHERECYDES&fragment=44 that shows the three source texts
collected under fragment 44 of Pherecydes, but without disambiguating letters because in
this case they are missing in the FHG. On this issue, see p. 151 n. 51.

The goal of the DFHG Web API is to output information about FHG frag-
menta of authors who are lost. In order to generate this output, the API selects
FHG source texts that are classified as fragment in the DFHG database and that
correspond to 613 authors.133 This number includes 83 authors for whom Karl
Müller publishes only introductory commentaries and not numbered fragmenta.
In this case the field text in the database is empty, as in the example of Cadmus
Milesius mentioned in the previous pages. The names of these authors are re-
ported below and are arranged by volumes and in the order in which they appear
in the collection:

The DFHG Web API generates also JSON objects about 7 authors whose source
texts are classified part as fragment and part as extant text, like in the example
of Apollodorus Atheniensis mentioned in the previous pages. In these cases the
JSON shows only source texts classified as fragment:
133 These 613 authors are listed in the DFHG Web API usage web page. The FHG has a total
of 636 authors including both fragment and extant text. On this classification, see p. 148.

4.3.7 Outputs
V The DFHG project automatically exports data of the FHG collection in two
formats: 1) CSV format files and 2) XML format files. The goal of the Web API
is to access information about FHG sources that are classified as fragment, which
means quotations and text reuses of lost texts. On the other side, the goal of the
CSV and XML output is to export data about all texts collected in the FHG. This is
the reason why these outputs include sources classified both as fragment and as
extant text, generating 636 files that correspond to the total number of authors
edited in the FHG.134
A PHP script extracts from the database a CSV file for each of the 636 FHG
authors. These files can de downloaded through a dedicated web page of the
DFHG project where authors are arranged by FHG volumes and in the order in
which they are published in the printed edition (fig. 4.16).135 Each CSV file corre-
sponds to one FHG author and contains data records from the following 25 fields
of the DFHG database with the addition of 2 fields for LOFTS URNs and CITE

134 Data classified with the type intro are not exported in the CSV and XML files (cf. p. 148).
The reason for this choice is due to the fact that, if the DFHG project aims at preserving
the entire edition of the FHG in a structured and machine readable format, the main goal
is to focus on the ancient sources collected in the printed volumes.

As far as the XML format is concerned, a PHP script exports from the
database two different kinds of files: 1) 636 EpiDoc TEI XML files, and 2) 636 well
formed XML files. EpiDoc TEI XML files are encoded in accordance with EpiDoc
standards. These files are available through a GitHub repository and through a
dedicated web page of the DFHG project where authors are arranged by FHG vol-
umes and in the order in which they are published in the printed edition.137 The
structure of these files is based on guidelines that have been specifically devel-
oped for the DFHG project as part of the EpiDoc community.138 Every EpiDoc TEI
XML file corresponds to one FHG author, whose texts are encoded within a com-
plex structure that represents the editorial work of Karl Müller as it is published in
the printed edition. Every file is generated with a PHP script that extracts records
from the fields of the DFHG database. Each EpiDoc TEI XML file shares the same
TEI Header with information about the project, the relevant FHG volume, and
the relevant author:

The attributes @target and @cRef in the element <ref> include a URL with a LOFTS
URN of the relevant FHG author and the corresponding CITE URN. URNs are not
part of the DFHG database and are generated by a PHP script and added to the
EpiDoc TEI header.139 The structure of the element <body> of each EpiDoc TEI
XML file represents the structure of the FHG and follows the main distinction
between sources that are classified as fragment and as extant text. Data is ex-
tracted from the DFHG database and exported in corresponding TEI elements.
Texts classified as fragment are encoded with the following structure:

The attribute @target in the element <ref> embeds URLs with LOFTS URNs that
point to the relevant level of the structure of each FHG text. URNs are not part of
the DFHG database and are generated by a PHP script and added to the EpiDoc
TEI XML output. The focus of the project is to export information about source
texts and therefore notes to subvolumes, works, work sections, books and com-
mentaries are not extracted from the database. Numbers that refer to subsections
(e.g., subsection 1 of Apollod., Bibl. 1.9.13) are included in the attribute @n of the
element <p>. Letters that disambiguate fragment numbers and non-alphabetic
characters added to fragment numbers to mean uncertainty are included in the
attributes @n and @rend of the element <cit>.140 Due to their extent, commentaries

the sequence of the relevant FHG text in the XML file, the ID from the DFHG
database, the LOFTS URN and the corresponding CITE URN.143 The structure of
these files is much simpler than that of the EpiDoc TEI XMl files, represents the
structure of the DFHG database, and allows scholars to easily extract information
about sources collected in the printed edition of the FHG.
142 Disambiguating letters and non-alphabetic characters added to fragment numbers are in-
cluded in their own elements in the XML file. On the importance of the DFHG ID for
keeping track of the original sequence of source texts in the FHG collection, see p. 148 n.

143 Numbers of books, chapters, sections and subsections are included in their own elements
in the XML file.

4.4 DFHG Add-ons
The DFHG project not only offers access to its data with the tools and services
described in the previous sections, but also expands and connects it with external
collections in order to produce further data that in the future will contribute to the
creation of new resources for the study of fragmentary historiography and in gen-
eral of fragmentary literature. Figure 4.17 shows the icons of the add-ons of the
DFHG project: 1) the Fragmentary Authors Catalog and the Witnesses Catalog aim
at building and expanding a catalog of ancient Greek fragmentary historians and
of their witnesses; 2) the Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance is the first complete
concordance of ancient Greek fragmentary historians published in the Fragmenta
Historicorum Graecorum and in Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker includ-
ing the continuatio and the Brill’s New Jacoby; 3) OCR Editing offers a web-based
tool for OCR post-correction; 4) Text Reuse Detection is an experiment for applying
text reuse detection techniques to the collection of the Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum; 5) at the time of writing, the DFHG project is experimenting Named
Entity Recognition and the creation of a complete Thesaurus of Greek and Latin
data of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum.
Figure 4.17. DFHG add-ons
4.4.1 Fragmentary Authors Catalog
§ The DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog is an add-on for searching the 636
Greek fragmentary historians of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum and for
getting an overview about where and how these authors are arranged in the col-
lection.144 This resource is complementary to the other tools of the DFHG Project
and can be consulted in conjunction with the index auctorum and the index tit-

ulorum printed at the end of FHG IV (671–678 and 679–698). Search fields of
the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog are Author (e.g., Hippys Rheginus) and
Volume of the FHG (e.g., FHG 2). The Output displays the following data, if avail-
able:
– FHG Volume: e.g., FHG 1;
– FHG Sub_Volume: e.g., Liber primus;
– Historical period of a group of FHG authors according to the classification
of Karl Müller: e.g., Inde ab incunabulis artis historicae usque ad finem Belli
Peloponnesiaci;
– Date of the historical period of a group of FHG authors according to the
chronology of Karl Müller: e.g., 520–404 B.C.;
– FHG Author with a link to the DFHG author page: e.g., Critias Atheniensis
(http://www.dfhg-project.org/DFHG/index.php?volume=Volumensecun
dum#urn:lofts:fhg.2.critias_atheniensis);
– FHG pages with a link to the printed edition of the FHG available through
Internet Archive: e.g., 68–71 (https://archive.org/stream/fragmentahistori0
2mueluoft#page/68/mode/1up);
– CITE URN of each FHG author: e.g., urn:cite:lofts:fhg.1.hellanicus;
– Place corresponding to the geographical epithet of each FHG author ac-
cording to the language of Karl Müller and with links to Canonical URIs of
the Pleiades gazetteer: e.g., Athenae (https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579
885).
The catalog has been produced semi-automatically by combining DFHG data with
new data and by structuring them in the following fields (records are about the
FHG author Dionysius Rhodius sive Samius):
1. id: 29
2. FHG vol.: FHG 2
3. FHG sub_volume: Liber primus

Figure 4.18. DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog: Dionysius Rhodius sive Samius
The goal of the catalog is to collect data about the exact location of authors in
the FHG, their chronology according to the arrangement of the FHG, pages with
links to the digital and the printed version of the FHG, canonical citations of
DFHG authors according to the CITE Architecture, and places corresponding to
the geographical epithet of each FHG author used by Müller.146
Records in the fields FHG Date_description and FHG Date have been ex-
tracted from the descriptions of FHG subvolumes. These records preserve the
language of Karl Müller to describe the ten books (libri) of FHG II–IV: see pp. 129
ff. They cover a period of time from archaic Greece to the reign of the emperor
Phocas. Book three (Liber tertius) is a section with authors from Aristoteles to his
disciples (Aristoteles ejusque discipuli), while book ten (Liber decimus) includes a
big group of authors of uncertain age arranged in alpabetical order (Scriptores
aetatis incertae ex ordine literarum).
145 The author has two geographical epithets because this is how he is attested in the Suda ([Δ
1181] s.v. Διονύσιος, Μουσωνίου, Ῥόδιος ἢΣάμιος, ἱστορικός […]). In the FGrHist and in
the BNJ, the FHG author has been split in two different authors: Dionysios von Samos (der
Kyklograph) (15) and Dionysios von Rhodos (511).
146 Links to the Perseus Catalog have not been added because they are already part of the
Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance: see section 4.4.3. The distribution of authors in the
FHG can be visualized and exported through the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog
Chart: see section 4.4.1.2.

4.4 DFHG Add-ons
197
Latin chronological descriptions are available for every book, while numer-
ical forms of dates (e.g., 520–404 B.C.) are available only for book 1 and books
4–9.147 Chronological data is missing for FHG I, the first part of FHG II (De in-
sidiis quae regibus structae sunt excerpta), the appendix of FHG IV (Appendix ad
librum nonum), and FHG V (pars prior and pars altera). Except for FHG I, filling
in this missing data is not the goal of the DFHG, because the project aims — as
far as possible — at a faithful representation of the editorial work of Karl Müller.
On the other side, the reason for extracting chronological data from the FHG is
an experiment to make it available and to eventually connect it with external
resources (see below).
Records in the field Geographical_epithet correspond to the geographical
adjectives added by Müller to author names. These adjectives have been used
to obtain place names (Place) in order to query place resources of the Pleiades
gazetteer for obtaining canonical URIs (Pleiades_URI) and geographical coordi-
nates (Latitude and Longitude) of places connected to FHG authors. The reason
for providing two places (Place1 and Place2) is due to the fact that there are four
cases in the FHG with two geographical epithets: Dionysius Rhodius sive Samius
(FHG II 9–11), Menodotus Perinthius vel Samius (FHG III 103–105), Magnus Car-
rhenus. Eutychianus Cappadox (FHG IV 4–6) and Agathocles Cyzicenus vel Baby-
lonius (FHG IV 288–290).148 The catalog reveals that there are 365 author names
with geographical epithets out of a total of 636 FHG authors.149 The collection
contains the following 184 unique geographical epithets:150
147 These numerical forms are part of the FHG Latin descriptions and have been extracted to
generate a separate field in the database.
148 The fact that the authors Magnus Carrhenus and Euthychianus Cappadox are together
depends on the arrangement of Karl Müller, who published one single passage from the
Chronographia of Joannes Malalas (p. 328, 20 – 333, 6 ed. Dindorf) under the headings
Magnus Carrhenus. Eutychianus Cappadox and Magni et Eutychiani fragmenta. The pas-
sage of Malalas includes two sequent sections derived from Magnus Carrhenus (Μάγνος
ὁχρονογράφος ὁΚαρηνός) and Euthychianus Cappadox (Εὐτυχιανὸς ὁχρονογράφος ὁ
Καππάδοξ). The fragment is not numbered in the FHG collection. The passage has been
split and the two authors have been published in two separate parts in the FGrHist and in
the BNJ: 225 and 226. The concordance among these editions can be obtained by searching
the Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance: see section 4.4.3. The decision of the DFHG project
not to split the passage of Malalas and to keep the two authors together as published in
the FHG is of course questionable, but the first goal of the DFHG project is to preserve the
editorial decisions of Karl Müller with their ambiguities and complexities.
149 For the complete list of FHG authors, see pp. 128 ff.
150 Author names of FHG I don’t have geographical epithets, but corresponding places have
been added in the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog because there is a general agree-
ment on them in modern scholarship and because I wanted to include them in the DFHG
Fragmentary Authors Map (see section 4.4.1.1). As for other volumes, missing geographical
epithets in the FHG correspond to missing places in the DFHG.

The six differences between the two lists are due to few inconsistencies of geo-
graphical epithets in the FHG.151 Place names have been manually generated from
the geographical epithets and their forms correspond to the forms used for place
resource entries in the Pleiades gazetteer.152 Each Pleiades entry has a Pleiades
Canonical URI with metadata and corresponding representative points (latitude
and longitude) that have been used to generate the DFHG Fragmentary Authors
Map described in section 4.4.1.1.153
The principle for producing the correspondence between geographical ep-
ithets and Pleiades places has been guided by the goal of representing interpre-
tations and conclusions of the editor of the FHG. Latin geographical epithets of
author names have been converted into corresponding Pleiades places. FHG com-
mentaries to authors have been consulted to check the correctness of the cor-
respondences and solve ambiguites.154 Of course many other places could have
been added to FHG authors in accordance with information collected in the FHG,
but such an effort was out of the scope of the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Cata-
log and would have required too much manual work for extracting this data from
commentaries and from notes of the FHG collection.155
Ambiguities and uncertainties are inevitable because they are present in the
sources about fragmentary authors and because connecting places to ancient au-
thors can be extremely complex.156 The DFHG project has decided to begin to
follow those elements of the FHG that are more visible and not ambiguous, such
as the epithets that are part of author names in the collection.
In any case, the database of the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog can be
edited and expanded, and data is automatically updated and ingested also in the
151 Alexandrensis and Alexandrinus e Troade for Alexandria Troas, Heracleensis and Heracleota
for Herakleia, Lacedaemonius and Laco for Lacedaemon, Maleotes and Mallotes for Mallos,
Naucratita and Naucratites for Naucratis, Teius and Tejus for Teos.
152 On the distinction among Places, Locations, and Names in Pleiades, see Cayless (2019) 38.
153 Pleiades Canonical URIs have been identified for every place corresponding to a geograph-
ical epithet of FHG authors, except for the epithets Oechaliensis (Linus Oechaliensis, FHG
IV 439) and Pygelensis (Democles Pygelensis, FHG II 20–21). In the first case the Greek form
of the epithet is Οἰχαλιώτης and the corresponding place name is Οἰχαλία (see Steph. Byz.,
s.v. Οἰχαλία), but it is not possible to identify which of the ancient places with this name is
connected to Linus (cf. FHG IV 439). In the second case the place is Πύγελα, but it doesn’t
have any entries in the Pleiades gazetteer.
154 For example in the case of the use of the epithet Alexandreensis for the place Alexandria
Troas.
155 An example is Apion Oasita, whose epithet corresponds to his place of birth (Oasis Magna).
Sources attest his activity in Alexandria (cf. FHG III 506) and Felix Jacoby labels the author
as Apion von Oasis und Alexandreia (FGrHist 616) and Apion Oasis/Alexandria (FGrHist
1057). BNJ 616 has only Apion of Alexandria.

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
DFHG Fragmentary Authors Map and in the Chart. Other digital resources provide
chronological and geographical data for ancient Greek fragmentary historians.
The project Jacoby Online offers this data for the Brill’s New Jacoby. The guide-
lines of the BNJ have a section for metadata about fragmentary authors including
Historian's date and Place of origin. An example is Deinon of Kolophon (BNJ
690), who is dated to the “4th century BC” (Historian’s date) and whose origin
is located in “Asia Minor” (Place of origin).157 The language of the project and
therefore of places and dates is English. The guidelines of the BNJ precise that the
field Historian’s date may contain exact dates (e.g., “99 BC”), general descrip-
tions (e.g., “Hellenistic Period”), and centuries (e.g., “5th century BC”). In order to
be found in the search engine, general descriptions must be converted into cen-
turies (e.g., “Hellenistic period” becomes “3rd–1st century BC”), centuries can’t
include further specifications (e.g., “early 4th century AD” becomes “4th century
AD”) and have to be expressed with ordinal numbers (e.g., “4th century AD”).
Beside centuries, a few other values are permitted, like “c.”, “unknown”, “various”
(only for scholia), “mythical past”. These provisions are part of the last guidelines
distributed to BNJ contributors (2019). In the first edition of the BNJ most of the
times the field Place of origin is left empty, while in the second edition is filled
in if it is known: see the example of Demetrios of Byzantion in the first and in
the second edition of BNJ 162. All this data can be visualized through the BNJ
web page and can be searched with its search engine, but is not exportable or
accessible through stantardized file formats or an API.
The Canon of Greek Authors and Works of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae
provides dates and geographical epithets for its authors, including fragmentary
historians (see pp. 18 f). The field Date includes “the century of an author’s
life or floruit” and its values are expressed in English with Arabic numerals for
centuries, the abbreviations B.C. and A.D., and other elements to indicate a termi-
nus ante quem, a terminus post quem, and uncertain chronology (with a question
mark or the Latin adjective incertum).158 The field Geographic epithet provides
information about “the place of birth or literary activity” of an author, when it
157 See http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1873-5363_bnj_a690.
158 For a detailed description of dates in the TLG Canon, see Berkowitz/Squitier (1990) xix–
xx: “Thus, dates — with all of the imperfections and speculativeness that they imply —
have become a fixture of the canon, sometimes functioning as an organizing principle
in responding to certain requestes for information from the data bank.” Information and
updates of the Canon are now available on the TLG website.

is possible and reasonable to find and add these pieces of data.159 Also in this
case, like for the BNJ, data can be only visualized and searched through the TLG
website, but not exported and accessible with an API.
The Perseus Catalog provides chronological and geographical data about au-
thors, including fragmentary ones. If available, these pieces of information are
part of the name of the author in the Authority Record, as for example “Hellanicus
of Lesbos”160 or “Ister Cyrenaeus 3. Jh. v. Chr”.161 The web page of the authority
record of the catalog doesn’t display these pieces of data in separate fields, but
they are accessible in the metadata of the catalog, which is available as biblio-
graphic records for editions/translations of works and as authority records for
its authors/textgroups. Metadata is represented according to two standards from
the Library of Congress (LC): the MODS (Metadata Object Description Standard)
XML schema for bibliographic metadata and MADS (Metadata Authority Descrip-
tion Standard) for all authority records.162 Perseus MADS XML files include ele-
ments to mark up also geographical epithets and chronological data of authors.
The following one is the MADS XML file of Ister Cyrenaeus, where the element
<mads:authority> nests the elements <mads:name> and <mads:namePart> that en-
code in the attribute @type the geographical epithet Cyrenaeus ("termsOfAddress")
and his chronology 3. Jh. v. Chr ("date"), whose forms are expressed in accor-
dance with the record of the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF):163
159 On the difficulties of providing geographical epithets, see Berkowitz/Squitier (1990) xx–
xxii: “Obviously, it is impossible to provide an appropriate geographical epithet for every
author, although in some cases it is possible to suggest two or three places associated
with an author’s floruit. The inadequacy of geographical epithets lies in their failure to
distinguish place of birth from place of literary activity or place of residence in an official
or ecclesiastical capacity. […] An effort to be exhaustive in charting the lives and activities
of authors in terms of geographical epithets would be doomed to failure in most cases and
altogether absurd in many others. […] Geographical epithets can be especially useful for
the purposes of the Canon if they are used to distinguish authors of the same name […]
systematic assignment of geographical epithets remains a task for more leisurely days in
the future. In the meantime, those that do appear in this edition are the result of either a
fairly firm tradition (including a firm tradition of uncertainty) or a need to distinguish one
author from another. There are, moreover, many authors whose geographical connections
we can only surmise. […] Finally, there are many authors whose geographical connections
we cannot possibly guess. When this is so, the space allotted for geographical epithets
remains blank.”

Assigning geographical epithets and dates to ancient authors is a very complex
task. In spite of that, there are many reasons for experimenting with it, which
depend on the kind of research questions a scholar tries to answer. In a digital
environment, geographical and chronological information of historical data are
now the target of ongoing projects and their treatment is important in order to
generate outputs for statistical analyses and visualization tools.
For the geography of the ancient world, reference resources are the above
mentioned Pleiades gazetteer and also the Pelagios Network, which aims at con-
necting “researchers, scientists and curators to link and explore the history of
places” (https://pelagios.org).164 As for the chronology, GODOT (Graph of Dated
Objects and Texts) is a graph database system that aims at “creating and maintain-
164 Elliott/Gillies (2009); Simon/Barker et al. (2017).

206
4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
ing a gazetteer of calendar dates in different calendar systems, initially those used
in Greek and Roman antiquity across the Mediterranean area, and providing links
to attestations of these dates in online editions” (https://godot.date).165 Another
resource is PeriodO, which is “a public domain gazetteer of scholarly definitions
of historical, art-historical, and archaeological periods. It eases the task of linking
among datasets that define periods differently. It also helps scholars and students
see where period definitions overlap or diverge” (https://perio.do).166
The complexity of the data is also due to the fact that there is a stratifica-
tion of elements coming not only from primary sources, but also from secondary
sources and scholarly editions. In the current state of the art, the DFHG project
doesn’t provide annotations of geographical and chronological expressions in the
Greek and Latin texts collected in the FHG.167 As of today, semantic annotations
of this type can be performed, but they are out of the current scope of the project.
Nevertheless and thanks to the DFHG, ancient Greek and Latin texts of the FHG
are now available in a structured and machine readabale format, which means
that linguistic analyses focusing on places and dates can be performed with ex-
ternal resources and by other scholars.
The goal of the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog is to go beyond the col-
lection of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum and pose the foundation for the
creation of a digital catalog of ancient Greek fragmentary historians and hope-
fully of ancient Greek and Latin fragmentary literature. As described in the pre-
vious pages, there are projects and resources partially providing this kind of in-
formation, but they are still quite different in terms of standardization and ac-
cessibility, which are significant issues that still limit a satisfying and complete
integration of data. Data collected in the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog is
used to generate two further resources that are described in the following sec-
tions: 1) Fragmentary Authors Map and 2) Fragmentary Authors Chart.

166 Rabinowitz/Shaw et al. (2018).
167 An example of this language can be found in the Suda [Α 2191]: Ἀνδροτίων, Ἄνδρωνος,
Ἀθηναῖος, ῥήτωρ καὶδημαγωγὸς, μαθητὴς Ἰσοκράτους. The adjective Ἀθηναῖος can be an-
notated as a reference to the place of origin and activity of Androtion, while the expression
μαθητὴς Ἰσοκράτους can be converted into an approximate chronological span about his
lifetime. This source is collected in the FHG not as a fragment, but as a textual evidence in
the introduction to the life of the Atthidographer (FHG I, lxxxiii).

4.4.1.1 Fragmentary Authors Map
ǅ Geographical coordinates of the catalog of FHG authors generate the DFHG
Fragmentary Authors Map, which geolocates authors using Google Maps.168 The
map has a search engine with the complete list of FHG authors and their rele-
vant places in square brackets (e.g., Aretades Cnidius [Cnidus]). Authors who
are characterized by two geographical epithets — and therefore by two relevant
places — are mapped in both locations (see the example of Dionysius Rhodius sive
Samius at figure 4.20).
Figure 4.19. DFHG Fragmentary Authors Map: Athenae
By hovering the mouse over each Google Maps pin, a pop-up window opens with
the list of FHG authors who are geolocated in that specific place. Every author is
accompanied by his FHG volume number in square brackets. An example is the
place Athenae at figure 4.19. By clicking an author name in the list, it is possible
to open the corresponding web page of the author in the DFHG Fragmentary
Authors Catalog. The map takes advantage of some of the Google Maps features.
One of the more significant is the marker clustering that combines markers of
closed proximity into clusters and simplify the display of the markers on the map.
This feature allows users to visualize all the DFHG places and their distribution

Figure 4.20. DFHG Fragmentary Authors Map: fragmentary authors
on the map. Cluster colors, based on a heat map gradient, show even better the
most represented regions in the FHG (fig. 4.21). By clicking on a cluster, users
are able to zoom in the relevant region and visualize in details its places that may
be further clustered or not. The DFHG Fragmentary Authors Map provides also a
map search to look for a specific place, like for example Syracusae:169 http://ww
w.dfhg-project.org/Fragmentary-Authors-Catalog/map.php?center=Syracusae.

The map is an experiment to visualize the geography of ancient Greek frag-
mentary historians. The project has not only a scholarly purpose, but also an
educational one to help students understand the complexities of locating ancient
historians and dealing with them in a digital environment. Many possible im-
plementations can be envisaged for such a project, as for example expanding it
to other collections of fragmentary authors, creating a historical Google Maps
through time, and adding more geographical annotations for each author.170 As
for now, these implementations are out of the scope of the DFHG project, but
the experiment aims at making the community of scholars and students aware of
these possibilities and issues in order to address them in a proper and sustainable
way.171
4.4.1.2 Fragmentary Authors Chart
« The arrangement and distribution of authors in the FHG can be visualized
through the DFHG Fragmentary Authors Chart.172 The chart has been created
with Highcharts and can be exported to different formats, such as PNG image,
JPEG image, PDF document and SVG vector image. By hovering the mouse over
each blue bar corresponding to one of the fifteen FHG sections (sub_volume), it is
possible to visualize the list and the number of authors collected in it, as in the
example of figure 4.22 that shows the list of the eighteen authors of book 9 (Liber
nonus) of FHG IV.
4.4.2 Witnesses Catalog
N The DFHG Witnesses Catalog is an add-on for searching authors and works
(witnesses) that preserve quotations and text reuses of the fragmentary historians
collected in the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum.173 The reasons for producing
this resource depend on three different factors: 1) The Fragmenta Historicorum
Graecorum doesn’t provide an index of the sources of the fragments and the DFHG
Witnesses Catalog aims at complementing it;174 2) Pierre Bonnechère published
170 For experiments in this direction, see the geography of the Digital Marmor Parium in section
4.5.3.
171 On geodata and on the history and impact of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and
related digital mapping technologies in humanities research, see Dunn (2019).
172 http://www.dfhg-project.org/Fragmentary-Authors-Catalog/authors_chart.php
173 http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/
174 FHG IV has indices of fragmentary authors and works published in the first four volumes
of the collection, but not of their witnesses: see p. 141.

three volumes of indexes of Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker showing
the importance of this kind of resource, but these volumes are only available
in a printed output protected by copyright;175 3) metadata of the editions of the
Jacoby Online project includes a Source field for expanded references to witnesses
of fragments; given that the project is still in progress, witnesses of fragments are
not yet available in a separate and structured database.176
The DFHG Witnesses Catalog provides a model for extracting and structur-
ing information about source texts of historical fragments, in order to enrich them
with stable machine readable bibliographic identifiers and connect them with ex-
ternal resources through other metadata. Search fields of the DFHG Witnesses
Catalog are:
175 See Bonnechère (1999), part. preface and introduction of vol. I on the necessity of the
indexes and on the difficulties for creating them. The language of the indexes is Latin. The
first volume (I) is an “alphabetical list of authors conserving testimonia and fragments”,
the second volume (II) is a “concordance Jacoby – source”, and the third volume (III) is
an “alphabetical list of fragmentary historians with alphabetical list of source-authors for
each”. On the work of Bonnechère see Marincola (2000).
176 See, for example, fragment 6 of Androtion of Athens (BNJ 324: http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1
873-5363_bnj_a324). In this case the witness is an entry (Ἵππαρχος) from the Lexicon of
Harpocration. The guidelines of the BNJ project request that references are expanded and
made available in English. They should also include a reference to the edition consulted
by the author of the BNJ entry. This last aspect is very important in order to know where
the text of the witness comes from. This kind of information is generally not available in
the FHG and in the FGrHist.

Parium, Marmor Rosettanum, Proverbia Bodleiana, Titi Livii Epitome, Veteres glossae verborum
iuris, Vita Sophoclis, Vitae Aeschyli, Vitae Arati, Vitae Euripidis, Vitae Homeri.
The reason for the overlapping depends on the nature of these sources and also
on the model of the classification adopted by the TLG Canon, where works whose
author’s names are unknown are listed under the field Author Name.180 For exam-
ple, the Etymologicum Magnum in the TLG is an Author with a four-digit number
(tlg4099), but also a Work title with a three-digit number (tlg4099.0001).181 Six-
teen works out of the twenty-nine listed above have a four-digit number in the
TLG Canon. As a matter of fact and except for the Epimerismi Homerici and the
Glossae rhetoricae, in the online version of the TLG they can be accessed with a
search both in the field Author and in the field Work Title. The other thirteen
works don’t have a correspondence in the TLG, but in the DFHG Witnesses Cat-
alog they have been treated in the same way as the other sixteen. The following
list is the same that has been printed above with the addition of available TLG
numbers:182
Anthologia Palatina (tlg7000), Appendix proverbiorum (tlg9007), Argumentum in Sophoclis Oedy-
pum Tyrannum, Argumentum in Theocriti Idyllia VI, Aristeae epistula ad Philocratem (tlg1183),

180 Berkowitz/Squitier (1990) xv: “Entries in the Canon are arranged in alphabetical order
according to names of authors and, where authors’ names are not known, commonly rec-
ognized names of extant treatises, poems, or literary corpora.”
181 The work title corresponds to the text of the Etymologicum Magnum published in the TLG
which is extracted from the edition of Thomas Gaisford (1848, repr. 1967). On the classifi-
cation of authors and works in the TLG, see pp. 18 ff.
182 The DFHG Witnesses Catalog doesn’t include TLG numbers, but provides CITE and CTS
URNs of the Perseus Catalog that embed TLG numbers. Given that there are TLG authors
and works that are still missing in the Perseus Catalog, it is possible that authors and works
in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog are not provided with corresponding Perseus URNs and
therefore TLG numbers. For example, the Appendix proverbiorum (tlg9007) is not in the
Perseus Catalog.
183 In the TLG Canon the Epimerismi Homerici (tlg5004.001) are cataloged under the
Epimerismi (tlg5004).
184 In the TLG the Glossae rhetoricae (tlg4289.004) are cataloged under the Lexica Segueriana
(tlg4289).

Another case is the Byzantine lexicon Suda, which is in the list of authors
and not in the list of works, because Suda is labelled as witness_author with Lexi-
con as its corresponding witness_work. This classification is the same of the TLG,
where Suda is tlg9010 and under it are grouped the Lexicon (tlg9010.001) and the
Onomasticon tacticon (tlg9101.002). A difference with the TLG is represented by
scholia, because they are classified only as witness_author. The reason is due to
the fact that in the DFHG catalog of witnesses scholia are always accompanied by
work titles (witness_work), as in the example of the Scholia in Aristophanem that
group eleven comedy titles (Acharnenses, Aves, Ecclesiazusae, Equites, Lysistrata,
Nubes, Pax, Plutus, Ranae, Thesmophoriazusae, Vespae). These classifications are
of course questionable and sources could be treated in a different way. Never-
theless, the goal of this work is not to provide definitive data, but to show and
discuss the complexity of philological citations and how this complexity should
be addressed in a digital environment, expecially because results affect in a sig-
nificant way visualizations and statistics.
In order to produce the catalog, data was initially exported from the field
witness of the DFHG database (see p. 151). This field preserves the citations
provided by Karl Müller, which are compact, sometimes inconsistent, and full of
abbreviations.185 After that, semi-automatic reworking was performed in order
to expand the abbreviations and generate uniform citations, whose elements have
been split into different fields in the database of witnesses.
The goal of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog is not to preserve the original form
of the citations of the FHG, because they are already preserved in the DFHG
database, but to create a new tool that collects the rich set of philological citations
of the FHG, connects them to external resources, and expands them in order to
contribute to the creation of a unified digital catalog of witnesses of fragmentary
literature.186
Two examples are “Herodot. IV, 36” (witness of fragment 1 of Hecataeus:
FHG I 1) and “Dionys. Halic. Archaeol. I, 28” (witness of fragment 1 of Hellani-
cus: FHG I 45). Paragraph 28 of book 1 of the work of Dionysius Halicarnassensis
preserves also fragment 1 of Xanthus (FHG I 36), but in this case the citation is
expressed as “Dionys. Halicarn. Antiq. I, 28 73 Reisk.” The citation of Herodotus
has been expanded, the reference to the passage has been exported to two sep-
185 This consideration is not a criticism against the work of Karl Müller, because the digitiza-
tion of the FHG reveals how he was able to be precise and in general very consistent when
working in an age without computers and on an enterprise that lasted about thirty years
to publish five printed volumes. This reflection is about the unavoidable inconsistency and
imperfections of bibliographic references in big editorial projects: cf. Bonnechère (1999),
vol. I, vii–x.
186 The production of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog lasted ca. four months of almost full time
work. On the standardization of Jacoby’s citations, see Bonnechère (1999), vol. I, ix.

arate fields, the book number has been converted from a Roman to an Arabic
numeral, and the title of his work has been added and inserted in another field:
Herodotus|Historiae|4|36
By searching “Herodotus” as a witness_author in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog, it
is possible to obtain a web page with this citation together with other passages
of the Historiae that preserve Greek historical fragments (fig. 4.23):
http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/index.php?what[]=witness_au
thor|Herodotus&onoffswitch=on
The two citations of the same paragraph of Dionysius Halicarnassensis have
been expanded and made uniform in the following way:
Dionysius Halicarnassensis|Antiquitates Romanae|1|28
Like in the case of Herodotus, the passage of Dionysius is accessible in a web page
of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog together with other passages of other Dionysius’
works that preserve historical fragments (fig. 4.24):
http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/index.php?what[]=witness_au
thor|Dionysius+Halicarnassensis&onoffswitch=on
Dionysius Halicarnassensis is not only a witness of other authors, but also
an FHG author because Karl Müller publishes fragments of the Antiquitates Ro-
manae preserved in a manuscript of the El Escorial collection (FHG 2 xxxi–xlii):

see p. 155. This is the reason why Dionysius Halicarnassensis can be searched in
the DFHG Witnesses Catalog both as a witness_author and as an author.
The citations of Herodotus and Dionysius Halicarnassensis are straightfor-
ward examples, but there are many other cases in the FHG that present complex-
ities for generating complete, stable, and machine readable references. Examples
are the form “Idem:” as witness of fragment 17 of Theopompus (FHG I 280) and
the form “Steph. Byz.:” as witness of fragment 3 of Hecataeus (FHG I 1). In
the first case the actual reference was manually obtained by checking the previ-
ous reference in the collection (Theop. fr. 16), which reveals that the witness is
Stephanus Byzantius.187 The precise reference to the work of the lexicographer
was completed by analyzing the text of fragment 17 that includes the word of the
entry (Κάλπαι):188
Stephanus Byzantius|Ethnica|Κάλπαι
The second example is an evidence of many different possible ways for abbreviat-
ing an author. In the FHG, Stephanus Byzantius is abbreviated as “S. B.”, “St. B.”,
“Steph. B.”, “Steph. Byz.”, “Steph.”, “Stephan.” and “Stephanus”. Automatic expan-
sions of these abbrevations are of course not a complex task, by their different
forms and those of other abbreviated authors and works have to be individuated
and collected in advance in order to produce consistent expanded references.
Another complex example is the reference to the witnesses of fragment 19
of Xanthus (FHG I 39–42). Under the number 19, Karl Müller collects different
source texts. Among them, there is a reference to Hesychius and to the Suda:
“Eadem Gygi tribuuntur ap. Hesychium et Suidam, qui eodem Xantho auctore ex
eodem libro haec in medium proferunt:”. This reference is followed by the quota-
tion of a Greek text: “Ὅτι πρῶτος Γύγης ὁΛυδῶν βασιλεὺς γυναῖκας εὐνούχισεν,
ὅπως αὐταῖς χρῷτο ἀεὶνεαζούσαις.” This text is an excerpt from an entry of the
Suda ([Ξ 9] s.v. Ξάνθος). We don’t have the corresponding text from Hesychius
(of Miletus), but the reference by Müller is due to the discussion about the hy-
187 The same form “Idem” is used also for fragments 17 and 18 of Theopompus. According
to the tradition of philological citations, the FHG is full of cases where the adjective idem
is used, sometimes in the abbreviated form “Id.”. There are also cases in the FHG where
the form idem can be only partially inferred from the previous reference in the collection.
The conversion of these references into independent and complete citations has been done
manually.
188 When structuring the content of the FHG for producing the database, the punctuation used
by Müller at the end of his citations was used to separate the witness from the text of the
fragment. In the case of lexicographic works, Müller generally adds a colon after the name
of the author (e.g., “Hesych.:”, “Suidas:”, etc.). After the colon, he prints the text of the
lexicographic entry that preserves the fragment, which also generally includes the word
that in modern references is part of a complete lexicographic citation (e.g., “Suda [Π 1168]
s.v. Περιθοῖδαι:”). As a consequence, the lack of the reference to the actual entry in the
citation of the witness has required a substantial and time consuming manual work to infer
it from the text of the corresponding fragment.

pothetical reconstruction of the text of Hesychius and about how much material
the author of the Suda derived from him. This is the reason why in this case
the DFHG Witnesses Catalog collects both references to Hesychius Milesius and
to the Suda.189 Finally, another interesting example that shows the complexities
for connecting traditional philological citations with digital editions of Classical
sources is represented by Strabo. In the FHG Karl Müller uses the citation sys-
tem adopted by Isaac Casaubon (1620) for citing the geographer, which means
referring to the book number of the Geography of Strabo and to the page and the
section of the printed edition of Casaubon. For example, Strabo XII 550, B is the
citation of the passage that preserves Hellanicus fr. 172 (FHG I 69). Digital edi-
tions of Strabo adopt the citation system devised by August Meineke (1852–1853),
who arranges the Geography in books, chapters, and paragraphs. Consequently,
the above mentioned citation in the edition of Meineke corresponds to Strabo XII,
3, 21.190
The reason for this choice in digital editions is due to the fact that the sys-
tem of Meineke separates in a precise way chapters and paragraphs, while the
system of Casaubon is not precise and this is a problem in a computational envi-
ronment.191 The Perseus Digital Library and the TLG provide the digital version
of the edition of Strabo by Meineke, which means that they provide the arrange-
ment of the contents of the Geography by books, chapters, and sections. The
Perseus CTS URN of the passage of Strabo (ed. Meineke) that preserves Hellan-
icus fr. 172 is urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:12.3.21. In the
case of Strabo, the DFHG Witnesses Catalog keeps the citations of Karl Müller that
are based on the edition of Casaubon. For connecting these passages to external
digital editions of Strabo, the citations of the FHG should be converted into the
corresponding citations of Meineke and, through their corresponding CTS URNs,
linked to the digital text of the Geography.192
Figures 4.23 and 4.24 show that the original citations provided in the FHG
have been not only expanded and made uniform, but also enriched with meta-
189 As a matter of fact, see FHG IV 171, Ξ 47, where Karl Müller publishes the text of Hesychius
Milesius reconstructed from the entry of the Suda. On the work of Hesychius and his
treatment in the FHG, see p. 157. For a recent discussion about the relationship between
Hesychius Milesius and the Suda in relation to Xanthus, see BNJ 765 T1a.
190 Meineke preserves in his edition the corresponding citation system of Casaubon by print-
ing it on the external margins of the pages and by adding a “C.” before each Casaubon page
number.
191 This is a well known issue in Classical philology and concerns the citation of other authors.
For a more extended discussion of this topic in relation to the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus,
see section 5.4.1.
192 This kind of work has been performed for the Deipnosphists of Athenaeus in order to gen-
erate stable computational identifiers of the work of the Nucratites: see chapter 5.

Figure 4.25. DFHG Witnesses Catalog: Phanodemus
These centuries are records in the database field witness_date and are visualized
as metadata in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog. They are also represented in the Wit-
nesses Timeline through the corresponding values in the fields witness_date_in
and witness_date_out.200
The database field witness_date_note contains the
records “?” and “Varia” to express uncertain chronology and these records are
visualized as metadata in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog.
Every web page of each witness_author has a list of passages with the cor-
responding fragmenta preserved by them. Figures 4.23 and 4.24 show that each
fragment is accompanied by data about its relevant fragmentary author, frag-
mentary work, and FHG volume. Each fragmentary author and each fragment
are linked to the DFHG URN Retriever (see p. 172). The last column of each row

shows the icon Ĝ which is linkable for performing experimental text reuse de-
tection.201
The DFHG Witnesses Catalog allows also to search fragmentary authors and
fragmentary works of the FHG. In this case the aim is to display witnesses (au-
thors and works) that preserve them in order to get an overview of the transmis-
sion of lost authors and works. Figure 4.25 shows a screenshot with the example
of the first witnesses of Phanodemus (FHG I 366–370), who is searchable as author
and accessible through the following link:

Figure 4.26. DFHG Witnesses Catalog: Theocles
The web page provides a complete list of the witnesses of Phanodemus in alpha-
betical order by author. As described before, every witness has a Perseus CITE
URN for the author, a Perseus CTS URN for the work, and metadata. Every witness
has a list of the passages with the corresponding fragmenta of Phanodemus that

they preserve.202 In figure 4.25 the first witness is Athenaeus of Naucratis with his
work Deipnosophists. In this case the last column — which is headed TEXT REUSE
— includes not only the icon Ĝ but also the acronym DA, which stands for Dig-
ital Athenaeus. The reason is due to the fact that text reuse in the Deipnosophists
of Athenaeus is detected through the Digital Athenaeus (DA) project.203
As it was previously mentioned, the FHG includes five homonymous au-
thors who are not published in the same volume: see p. 172. An example is the
name Theocles, who corresponds to two authors published in FHG III (665) and
FHG IV (512). By searching the author Theocles in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog, it
is possible to visualize a list of the witnesses of both authors named Theocles with
metadata that allows to distinguish among them (fig. 4.26). Another example is
the fragmentary work title Ἀττικά, which is searchable as work and accessible
through this link (fig. 4.27):
http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/index.php?what[]=work|ΑΤΤΙ
ΚΑ&onoffswitch=on
In this case each passage of each witness lists the fragmenta that are classifed
by Karl Müller as originally belonging to fragmentary works entitled ΑΤΤΙΚΑ.204
Given that the structure of the FHG is not monolithic, there are other complexities
represented in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog. An example of these complexities
202 The order of the passages is by fragmentary work and by fragmentary number.
203 See section 4.4.5.
204 The order of the passages is by fragmentary author and fragment number.

230

is the record “No Witness Author” in the database field witness_author. This
record is used for FHG authors who don’t have a witness, by which we mean
three different situations: 1) authors without fragments, 2) authors to whom
Müller attributes works without fragments, and 3) authors who are preserved
by inscriptions and manuscripts or whose texts are published according to cer-
tain editions.205 The record “No Witness Author” is not present in the FHG, but
has been added in order to avoid empty fields in the database and in order to
represent fragmentary authors who have been published in the FHG with char-
acteristics and structures different from those cited in the previous pages.206
Another complexity is represented by authors who are partly fragmentary
and partly extant. An example already mentioned is Dionysius Halicarnassen-
sis, who is both a witness and an author in the FHG (see p. 218). Figure 4.28
shows Dionysius Halicarnassensis as author in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog.207
The web page displays the fragments of the Antiquitates Romanae preserved by
a manuscript of the El Escorial collection (see p. 155). In this case the database
represents the structure of the work of Dionysius with passages, books, and para-
graphs as they are arranged by Karl Müller in the printed edition of the FHG.
Finally, the field author of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog includes also ex-
tant authors.208 The reason for publishing these authors depends on the fact that
collections of fragmentary authors are first of all collections of extant texts that
preserve quotations and text reuses of lost authors and works, and in this respect
the FHG is a perfect example. Accordingly, the DFHG Witnesses Catalog includes
the Bibliotheca of Apollodorus Atheniensis and the two inscriptions of the Mar-
mor Parium and of the Marmor Rosettanum. The database of the catalog repre-
sents the FHG structure of these works.209 The Parian Marble and the Rosetta
205 For a discussion about these authors, see p. 236.
206 The output of the search “No Witness Author” in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog reveals
inconsistencies, because it includes metadata concerning the field witness_author. An ex-
ample is the inscription CIG I 380, where the chronology (3 A.D.) is repeated twice and
metadata about the literary epithet (Tituli) and the geography (Atheniensis – Athenae) are
connected to the field witness_author: http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog
/index.php?what[]=witness_author|No+Witness+Author&onoffswitch=on. The repeti-
tion of the chronology is due to the fact that in the database there are fields for the date of
inscriptions and manuscripts (see below). These pieces of metadata allow to visualize the
inscription in the map and in the timeline, but future developments of the DFHG Witnesses
Catalog will rearrange them in separate fields.

Figure 4.28. DFHG Witnesses Catalog: Dionysius Halicarnassensis (author)
Stone are classified both as author and as witness_author and witness_work.210
Apollodorus Atheniensis is more complex, because in the FHG the name of the
author is APOLLODORUS ATHENIENSIS and the title of his work is ΒΙΒΛΙ-
ΟΘΗΚΗΣ, while modern scholarship attributes the Bibliotheca to the so called
Pseudo-Apollodorus.211 Given that one of the aims of the DFHG Witnesses Cat-
alog is to go beyond the FHG and connect its citations with external resources,
this author is classified in the following way: APOLLODORUS ATHENIENSIS
(author), ΒΙΒΛΙΟΘΗΚΗΣ (work), Pseudo-Apollodorus (witness_author), Biblio-
theca (witness_work). The output of the search of the author Apollodorus Athe-
niensis displays him under the witness_author Pseudo-Apollodorus.212
Another interesting example in terms of complexities and expansion of data
is represented by Heraclides Ponticus, who is an author published by Karl Müller
in FHG II 197–224. In the DFHG Witnesses Catalog Heraclides Ponticus is search-
able as author, but the output displays him under the witness_author Heraclides
Lembus, who is also an author because published in FHG III 167–171. The reason
is due to the fact that recent scholarship attributes the excerpta of the Politeiai to
Heraclides Lembus (see p. 156).
The goal of this monograph is not to describe each example of the DFHG
Witnesses Catalog. By navigating the catalog and comparing its entries with the
printed edition of the FHG, it is possible to understand the complexities that we
have to deal with when working with philological citations and fragmentary lit-
210 For their classification as witness_author and as witness_work, see p. 216. The classification
as author reflects their inclusion among the authors of the FHG, where they don’t have a
title, but only a section name.

erature. The catalog is rather a way for beginning a discussion about different
possible models for digitizing and structuring philological citations of printed
critical editions and for creating new forms of them in a born-digital critical en-
vironment. As a consequence of this discussion, the DFHG Witnesses Catalog has
also addressed the problem of expanding data about editions, manuscripts, and
inscriptions cited by Karl Müller and linking them with external resources.
The database of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog has seven fields for
inscriptions,
manuscripts,
and editions:
Inscription,
Inscription_date,
Inscription_link, Manuscript, Manuscript_date, Manuscript_link, Edition. The
catalog currently contains 135 citations of 4 inscriptions: CIG I 380, CIG II 2905
(p. 573), IG XII 5, 444 and OGIS 90A. References to the Corpus Inscriptionum Grae-
carum (CIG) are present in the FHG, while those to the Inscriptiones Graecae (IG)
for the Marmor Parium and to the Orientis Graeci Inscriptiones Selectae (OGIS)
for the Marmor Rosettanum are additions because they were published after the
publication of the FHG.213 The addition of these collections is an example of the
expansion of data of the FHG in order to provide links to external resources and
further information about source texts originally collected by Karl Müller.214
Dates (Inscription_date) are based on their editions and expressed by cen-
turies without further specifications.215 If available, links (Inscription_link) are
to the epigraphic collection of the Packard Humanities Institute (PHI), otherwise to
the corresponding pages of the printed editions accessible through Google Books.
The catalog currently contains 592 citations of about 40 manuscripts.216
Dates (Manuscript_date) of manuscripts are mainly provided according to the
database Pinakes. Textes et manuscrits grecs.217 If available, the catalog provides
links (Manuscript_link) to digital collections of manuscripts, like the Bibliotheca
Palatina digital of the University of Heidelberg.218 An example is the Codex Palat-
inus Graecus 398 that is part of the Heidelberg collection, which provides access to
a high resolution image of each page of the manuscript with a DOI and a citation
link. The structure of the digital collection allows to access a specific section of
the manuscript, as for example the Mirabilia of Phlegon Thrallianus (216r–236r),
213 The first part of fascicle 5 of IG XII and the first volume of OGIS were both published in
1903.
214 IG and OGIS for the Marmor Parium and the Marmor Rosettanum have been chosen because
they are still considered reference editions. Of course the goal would ideally be to add other
corresponding later editions of these two inscriptions, but this kind of work has still to be
manually performed and can be only part of a larger effort for a centralized catalog of
witnesses of fragmentary literature.
215 See p. 227.
216 The number is not precise because there are cases where citations are ambiguous in the
FHG. An example is the generic reference to a “Codex Parisinus” for fragment 27 of
Mnaseas Patrensis.

whose text is published in the third volume of the FHG (611–624).219 Digital col-
lections of historical documents with metadata and stable identifiers are growing
every day. The possibility of visualizing high resolution images of manuscripts
that preserve fragmentary authors and works is an invaluable service for schol-
ars, but the problem is that these resources are not yet complete and centralized.
Due to these limits and also to the limits of the FHG, the DFHG Witnesses Catalog
is not meant to provide a definitive resource for getting information about the
manuscripts collected by Karl Müller, but to begin individuate needs and issues
for such a task.
Figure 4.29. DFHG Witnesses Catalog: Bekker. Anecdota Graeca II. Berolini 1816
Another experiment has been performed with critical editions that are sometimes
cited in the FHG as part of witnesses’ references to fragments. The catalog cur-
rently contains 483 citations of 34 editions. In this case an effort has been done to
find digital versions of these editions through Google Books and Internet Archive,
and to provide links (Witness_passage_link) to their pages that are cited in the
FHG.
219 The URN of the entire manuscript is urn:nbn:de:bsz:16–diglit–3033 and the DOI is ht

to experiment with expansions of the resource, two editions that were published
after the publication of the FHG have been added to the DFHG Witnesses Catalog:
the two volumes of the Pollucis Onomasticon by Erich Bethe (1900, 1931) and the
first volume of the Scriptores originum Constantinopolitarum by Theodor Preger
(1901). As in the case of inscriptions, these editions allow to see the differences
with the text published in the FHG and provide the entire context from which
the fragments of the FHG have been extracted. Data collected in the DFHG Wit-
nesses Catalog is used to generate three further resources that are described in the
following sections: 1) Witnesses Map, 2) Witnesses (Authors) Chart and Witnesses
(Works) Chart, and 3) Witnesses Timeline.
4.4.2.1 Witnesses Map
ǅ Data collected in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog has been used to produce a
Witnesses Map, which is an experiment for geolocating authors who preserve
quotations and text reuses of fragmentary authors published in the Fragmenta
Historicorum Graecorum using Google Maps.220 The method adopted for creating
the map is the same of the Fragmentary Authors Map.
Place names have been generated from geographical epithets of witnesses
and places have been geolocated thanks to Pleaides Canonical URIs.221 The differ-
ence is that, in the case of fragmentary authors, geographical epithets were pro-
vided by the FHG as part of author names (except for FHG I), while geographical
epithets of witnesses are rarely included in the FHG and therefore a significant
amount of time was devoted to add them using data from the TLG Canon, the
Perseus Catalog, and the Brill’s New Pauly.222 The map has a search engine with
the complete list of witnesses (authors) and of their relevant places in square
brakets (e.g., Plutarchus [Chaeronea]). By hovering the mouse over each Google
Maps pin, a pop-up window opens with the list of witnesses who are geolocated
in that specific place, as in figure 4.30 where it is possible to see the example of
witness authors from Athens.

4.4.2.2 Witnesses Charts
« Data of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog has been used to produce two charts: 1)
witnesses (authors) chart223 and 2) witnesses (works) chart.224 These two charts
have been generated with Highcharts and can be exported to different formats,
such as PNG image, JPEG image, PDF document and SVG vector image.
The Witnesses (Authors) Chart visualizes the total number of witnesses (au-
thors) of the FHG (244) and of their occurrences (10,339) with the corresponding
fragmentary authors.225 The aim of the chart is to show not only the number of
witnesses, but also the number of fragmentary authors preserved by each of them.
The chart extracts data from the field witness_author of the database of the DFHG
Witnesses Catalog.226 For each witness-author the chart shows the corresponding
fragmentary authors of the FHG. By hovering the mouse over each blue bar, it is
223 http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/authors_chart.php
224 http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/works_chart.php
225 As described in section 4.4.2, witnesses are distinguished between authors and works. The
total number of witness-authors in the database of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog is 245,
because one of them is labelled as “No Witness Author” (see p. 230).
226 This is the reason why editions, inscriptions, and manuscripts are not included in the chart:
on these fields see section 4.4.2.

236
4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
possible to see the list of the fragmentary authors who share the same witness-
author. The witness-author with most occurrences is Stephanus Byzantius (1,287)
and the witness-author with less occurrences is Gregorius Magistratus (1).
This chart reflects the work of Karl Müller and partly confirms results that
have been already gained by Classical philology, but it also reveals new data
and interesting aspects concerning the complexity of traditional classifications
of printed critical editions. For example, figures 4.31 and 4.32 show the number
of times that Harpocration and the Suda are mentioned in the FHG as witnesses
of fragmentary authors. The chart reveals that Harpocration preserves 317 frag-
ments of 56 historians, while the Suda preserves 288 fragments of 84 historians.
We therefore have more fragments preserved by Harpocration, but belonging to
lesser fragmentary authors than to those whose fragments are preserved by the
Suda.
The chart has a line whose witness_author is “No Witness Author” with 204
occurrences and a list of 94 fragmentary authors.227 80 authors of this list don’t
have fragments in the FHG, while the remaining 14 authors are characterized by
different situations:
– authors to whom are attributed works without fragments or fragments
without a text (Apion Oasita, De metallica disciplina; Cornelius Alexander
Polyhistor, Χαλδαικά; Hellanicus, fr. 148; Lysimachus Alexandrinus, Περὶ
Ἐφόρου κλοπῆς; Theopompus, fr. 315);
– authors who have fragments coming from inscriptions (Dexippus Athe-
niensis, fr. 1; Maeandrius Milesius, fr. 7);
– authors who have fragments preserved by manuscripts (Aristoteles, fr.
[274]; Dicaearchus Messenius, frr. 59–61; Joannes Antiochenus, frr. 2, 4, 6,
8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 217, 218; Mnaseas Patrensis, fr. 27; Phlegon Trallianus,
frr. 1, 29–64);
– authors who have fragments in the FHG that are published according to
previous editions (Anonymus qui Dionis Cassii Historias continuavit; Call-
inicus Petraeus, fr. 1).
Given that the DFHG Witnesses Catalog includes also extant texts, the Witnesses
(Authors) Chart visualizes them (see p. 230). In these cases there is a correspon-
dence between author and witness_author, and the chart allows to see the number
of their occurrences.228
The second chart is the Witnesses (Works) Chart that shows the total number
of witnesses (works) of the FHG (458) and of their occurrences (10,085) with the
corresponding fragmentary authors. The aim of the chart is to show not only the
number of witnesses, but also the number of fragmentary authors preserved by
227 On the meaning of “No Witness Authors” in the DFHG Witnesses Catalog, see p. 230.
228 An example is Pseudo-Apollodorus (Apollodorus Atheniensis) with 1,028 occurrences.

each of them. The chart extracts data from the field witness_work of the database
of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog. For each witness-work the chart shows the cor-
responding fragmentary authors of the FHG. By hovering the mouse over each
blue bar, it is possible to see the list of the fragmentary authors who share the
same witness-work. The witness-work with most occurrences is the Ethnica of
Stephanus Byzantius (1,286) and the witness-work with less occurrences is the
De mensuribus et ponderibus of Epiphanius (1).
4.4.2.3 Witnesses Timeline
E The Witnesses (Authors) Timeline is an experiment to visualize the chronolog-
ical distribution of the witness-authors of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graeco-
rum.229 The timeline has been generated with Highcharts and can be exported
to different formats, such as PNG image, JPEG image, PDF document and SVG
vector image. The timeline extracts records from the fields witness_date_in and
witness_date_out of the database of the DFHG Witnesses Catalog, which allow to
represent centuries before and after Christ (fig. 4.33).230

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
4.4.3 Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance
ȇ The Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance is an add-on that for the first time
allows to find concordances between ancient Greek fragmentary historians pub-
lished in the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum of Karl Müller and in Die Frag-
mente der griechischen Historiker of Felix Jacoby including the continuatio and the
Brill’s New Jacoby.231 This concordance complements the FGrHist and the Jacoby
Online, which provide incomplete or absent concordances to FHG authors.232
In the FGrHist Felix Jacoby publishes an incomplete concordance between
his edition and the FHG. This concordance is constituted by four different concor-
dances that are printed at the end of four volumes of the FGrHist and that are di-
vided into a concordance of fragments (Konkordanz der Fragmentzahlen zwischen
FGrHist(Jac) and C. Muellers Fragm. Hist. Graec.(Mü)) and an Index auctorum.233
In the Konkordanz der Fragmentzahlen Jacoby lists only a selection of FGrHist au-
thors for whom he provides correspondences with the FHG at the level of both
authors and fragments.234 In the Indices auctorum of FGrHist I–II Jacoby lists all
the other FGrHist authors and their correspondent FHG authors, but without a
correspondence of fragments. In the Index auctorum of FGrHist III the correspon-
dence with the FHG is missing.235
The Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance ingests concordances and indices of
the FGrHist and fill them in with data not provided by Felix Jacoby. Considering
the complexity of the FHG and of the FGrHist, which is evident by consulting
the Konkordanzen and the indices auctorum of the FGrHist, the concordance of
the DFHG project provides correspondences for authors and not for fragments
231 http://www.dfhg-project.org/Mueller-Jacoby-Concordance/
232 On the printed edition of the FGrHist see pp. 35 ff. On the Jacoby Online project, see
section 2.1.2.
233 FGrHist IA 43–52 (concordance for FGrHist I and index auctorum); IIB 1237–1257 (con-
cordance for FGrHist II and index auctorum for FGrHist I–II); IIIB 759–779 (concordance
for FGrHist IIIAB and index auctorum for FGrHist I–IIIB); IIIC 944–964 (concordance for
FGrHist IIIC and index auctorum for FGrHist I–IIIC).
234 One of the characteristics of the printed edition of the FGrHist is that Jacoby usually adds
numbers of FHG fragments that correspond to numbers of FGrHist fragments. This infor-
mation is missing in the online version of the FGrHist in the Jacoby Online project.
235 The publication of the FGrHist lasted many years and the difficulties and challenges of this
gigantic plan can be seen also through the Konkordanzen and the indices auctorum, where
Jacoby sometimes mentions authors he would have published in later volumes or authors
he never published and who are now published as part of FGrHist IV and V. Examples are
Aisopos and Pherekydes von Leros, who are numbered as 55a and 55b in the index auctorum
of FGrHist I, but who were later published with numbers 187a and 475. Another example
is Diogenianus (or Diogenianos), who is mentioned in the indices auctorum of FGrHist I–
II and I–IIIB, but who has been recently published in FGrHist V with the number 2015a.
Except for the Konkordanzen and the index auctorum of FGrHist I–IIIC, the other indices of
the FGrHist are available in the Jacoby Online website.

(see figure 4.34). A complete concordance of fragments is a work that requires a
significant investment in terms of time and human resources, because there are
many complexities and ambiguities that have to be identified and represented in
a digital environment.236 Also, data is still missing because the Jacoby Online is
not yet finished and because, in the current state of the Brill’s project, it is not
possible to automatically export identifiers (URLs) of fragments from the online
website.
Figure 4.34. Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance: Aristonicus Tarentinus
The goal of the Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance is to combine data produced
in the DFHG project, data extracted from the Jacoby Online, and information
collected from the printed edition of the FGrHist. The concordance includes all
the authors published in the FHG, in the FGrHist, and in the Brill’s New Jacoby
(1st and 2nd edition), because the main focus is on the close relation among these
three collections.237 Given that the continuatio of the FGrHist and the BNJ are
still open projects, their authors are progressively added to the concordance as
soon as they are published in the Jacoby Online.238 Karl Müller authored also
other editions that collect fragmentary authors which have been included in the
DFHG concordance, but only for those authors who have a correspondence in the
FHG.239 Finally, the Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance includes CITE URNs of
FHG authors and links to corresponding entries of the Perseus Catalog.240
236 Three months of mostly manual work have been invested for producing the Müller-Jacoby
Table of Concordance.
237 On the relationship between the works of Karl Müller and Felix Jacoby and on the differ-
ences between their two editions, see section 4.1.

for constantly keeping me up to date with new published entries.

240 On CITE URNs of the DFHG project, see p. 176.

242
4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
Search fields of the Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance are: 1) FHG volume
number (e.g., FHG 3); 2) FHG page number (e.g., 617–622); 3) FHG author name (e.g.,
Stesimbrotus Thasius); 4) FGrHist author name (e.g., Hellanikos von Lesbos); 5)
FGrHist author number (e.g., 323a);241 6) BNJ 1 author name (e.g., Akousilaos of
Argos); 7) BNJ 1 author number (e.g., 2); 8) BNJ 2 author name (e.g., Aristonikos of
Tarentum); 9) BNJ 2 author number (e.g., 57). The concordance allows to combine
filters using logical AND/OR expressions to obtain a more precise selection. For
example, it is possible to get data of all the sections about Hellanikos von Lesbos
in the FGrHist (4, 323a, 601a, 608a, 645a, 687a) or only of the section numbered
323a. The Output of the concordance displays the following data, if available:
– FHG volume number, author name, pages (with fragments when corre-
sponding to specific authors in the FGrHist and the BNJ), link to the printed
edition of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum in Internet Archive, DFHG
URLs, and CITE URNs;242
– SRAM author name, pages, and link to the printed edition of the Scriptores Re-
rum Alexandri Magni by Friedrich Dübner and Karl Müller in Google Books
(only for corresponding authors in the FHG, FGrHist, and BNJ);
– GGM volume number, author name, pages, and link to the printed edition
of the Geographi Graeci Minores by Karl Müller in Google Books (only for
corresponding authors in the FHG, FGrHist, and BNJ);
– Herodot. author name, pages, and link to the printed edition of the Herodoti
Historiarum libri ix by Wilhelm Dindorf and Karl Müller in Google Books
(only for corresponding authors in the FHG, FGrHist, and BNJ);
– FGrHist author name, author number, and link to the Jacoby Online;
– BNJ 1 author name, author number, and link to the Jacoby Online;
– BNJ 2 author name, author number, and link to the Jacoby Online;243
– Perseus Catalog author name and link to the Perseus Catalog entry.
Author names and numbers in the DFHG concordance faithfully represent forms
used by Karl Müller, Felix Jacoby, and other scholars who have been contributing
to the continuatio of the FGrHist and to the BNJ. As far as the FGrHist and the
241 Authors in the FGrHist are identified by unique numbers sometimes with the addition of
letters. This is the reason why the DFHG concordance doesn’t include a reference to the
FGrHist parts (I, II, III, IV and V). For an overview of the organization of the FGrHist, see
the Jacoby Online project website.
242 FHG fragments corresponding to specific authors in the FGrHist and the BNJ are fr. 3 of
Maeandrius Milesius (Leander Milesius) (FHG II 335), fr. 7 of Neanthes Cyzicenus. Lysi-
machus (FHG III 4), fr. 14 of Metrodorus Scepsius (FHG III 205), fr. 12 of Aristodemus The-
banus (FHG III 311), fr. 3 of Aristonicus Tarentinus (FHG IV 337), and frr. 7–8 of Dositheus
(FHG IV 402).
243 The Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance provides URLs for each author of the FGrHist, BNJ
1, and BNJ 2 available in the Jacoby Online website, whose access to the full version requires
a subscription through the publisher Brill or through an institution.

4.4 DFHG Add-ons
243
BNJ are concerned, entries are expressed according to the Jacoby Online, whose
language may slightly differ from the printed edition. As of 2021, the Müller-
Jacoby Table of Concordance includes 1,094 entries from the FGrHist, 865 entries
from BNJ 1, and 254 entries from BNJ 2.244 A complete list of the authors of the
concordance, together with the 636 authors of the FHG, is available through a
separate web page of the DFHG concordance (fig. 4.35).245

4.4.4 OCR Editing
Ƕ OCR Editing is an add-on of the DFHG project for experimenting with Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) post-correction. The printed edition of the FHG
has been OCRed by the social enterprise Digital Divide Data (DDD) and released
in five text files with a basic XML encoding that represents the layout of each
volume (see p. 143). Like other editions that have been OCRed as part of the Open
Greek and Latin project, the output of the FHG has not been proofread and still
244 These entries correspond to a total of 457 authors in the Perseus Catalog.

contains OCR errors.246 As for now, implementing a complete workflow for OCR
post-correction is out of the scope of the DFHG project, because such a task can
be only part of large-scale digitization projects. Nevertheless, in order to make
the community of scholars aware of the current state of OCR technologies applied
to critical editions of Classical sources, the DFHG project has implemented a web
interface for OCR post-correction based on models of crowd-sourcing projects.247
Figure 4.36. DFHG OCR Editing
This functionality is accessible through the DFHG Search and through the DFHG
URN Retriever. When searching DFHG contents or retrieving passages of DFHG
texts, results display the edit icon z on the right of the page in correspondence
of each fragment (fig. 4.14).248 By clicking the icon, users get access to a new
window for suggesting corrections of references to witnesses and of texts of frag-
ments, Latin translations, and commentaries (fig. 4.36). The window doesn’t re-
quest a registration, but only the name of the Submitter and a validation through
the reCAPTCHA system.249 The correction is ingested in a database and validated
by the DFHG project team through an administration page.
246 On results of OCR for ancient Greek and critical editions of Classical sources, see Pi-
otrowski (2012) 34–37, Robertson/Boschetti (2017), and Robertson (2019). The files with
the OCR output of the FHG provided by DDD missed pages, that were later OCRed and
post-corrected as part of the DFHG project: the entire section of the Marmor Rosettanum
and its index was missing in FHG I, 6 pages were missing in FHG II, 9 pages were missing
in FHG III, 14 pages were missing in FHG IV, and 2 pages were missing in FHG V.
247 On collaborative correction of OCR output, see Piotrowski (2012) 43–48. For projects of
cultural heritage that involve crowdsourcing and include OCR, see Ridge (2015) and Ridge
(2016).
248 On the Search function of the DFHG and on the URN Retriever, see sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.5.
The edit functionality works only for fragments.
249 On the use of reCAPTCHA for collaborative OCR correction, see Piotrowski (2012) 45–48.

4.4 DFHG Add-ons
245
In the Summer 2016 the OCR Editing of the DFHG project was experimented
by a group of three graduate students in Classics, who were selected to partic-
ipate in the CHS Summer Internship in Publications. The internship was held at
the Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington DC and organized in
collaboration with the Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at
the University of Leipzig as part of the Free First Thousand Years of Greek (FF1KG)
project.250 During the CHS Summer Internship, the three students worked two
hours per day for two weeks (June 16–30, 2016) on the Digital Fragmenta His-
toricorum Graecorum project and on the Digital Athenaeus project.251 As for the
DFHG, assignments included work on data citation and catalog entries of FHG
texts, on extracting combined searches in the DFHG Digger and in the DFHG
Search, on aligning Greek fragments with their Latin translations in the Alpheios
alignment editor, and on OCR post-correction.252 As far as OCR is concerned, stu-
dents edited minor errors (e.g., punctuation and capitalization) of 64 fragments
of the first volume of the FHG. The assignment was not only focusing on OCR
corrections with a sequential approach to the text, but also correcting texts that
resulted from searches in the collection to explore the structure of fragmentary
works and to analyse the language of fragmentary historiography.
The CHS Summer Internship was a lucky situation with a group of graduate
students in Classics, who were selected and supported by a renown institution
for working on a digital project whose aim is to edit and publish ancient Greek
and Latin data. As part of this opportunity, the DFHG project benefited in terms
of experiments and results, but this is not the usual situation in academic teach-
ing and research projects. This is the reason why OCR post-correction at large
scale still remains an open question for projects on historical and philological
documents.253
4.4.5 Text Reuse Detection
Ĝ The DFHG project offers automatic text reuse detection of fragmentary works
in their witnesses. As described in chapter 2, there are projects that have been ex-
perimenting with the application of text reuse detection to historical documents.
250 On the FF1KG project and on the CHS Summer Internships in Publications, see Muellener
(2019). The three students were Caitlin Miller (Yale University), Josh Blecher-Cohen (Har-
vard University), and Jack Duff (University of Massachusetts). The Summer Internship was
held from June 1 through July 31, 2016.
251 At the time, the DFHG project was still in progress and offered access only to the first
volume of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum.
252 On Alpheios, see p. 101.
253 On this note, cf. the review of the DFHG project by Buxton (2018).

246
4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
In these cases the detection is performed for text reuses of still surviving sources,
where it is possible to compare the reuse with the original text from which the
reuse itself derives.254
Classical fragmentary historiography mostly detects reuses of lost authors
and works, which means that the original versions are lost and that the analysis
has to be conducted only in the extant textual reuses. The technology for detect-
ing reuses of lost texts has still to come and requires the production of more digital
resources and training data. This is the reason why the DFHG project adopts text
reuse detection to compare the version of the witnesses of fragments that were
published by Karl Müller in the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum with other
editions of these witnesses that are available in a digital format. This kind of de-
tection allows to analyze how quotations and text reuses are extracted from their
witnesses and edited by Karl Müller in his critical edition of fragmentary authors
and works.
For reasons of sustainability, the DFHG project has not implemented new
text reuse algorithms, but makes use of a PHP implementation of the Smith-
Waterman Algorithm that performs local sequence alignment to detect similar-
ities between strings using words as tokens. This algorithm has been used for
sequencing DNA and for detecting plagiarism and collusion by comparing se-
quences of text.255 Text reuse can be detected through the DFHG Witnesses Cat-
alog (http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog), where each text passage
published in the FHG is aligned with the collections of XML files of Classical
sources of the Perseus Digital Library and of the Free First Thousand Years of Greek
(FF1KG) of the Open Greek and Latin project.256
As described at p. 228, for each FHG text passage the catalog provides text
reuse through the icon Ĝ in a column which is headed TEXT REUSE.257 By clicking
on the icon, a new window opens with the text of the selected passage. Figure
4.37 shows the example of Hdt. 4.36 (= FHG I, Hecataeus fr. 1) that has been
selected from the list of passages of the Historiae of Herodotus that are collected
in the FHG as witnesses of historical fragments (cf. fig. 4.23). The window offers
two possibilities for performing text reuse detection: 1) insert the URL of an XML
file of the text of the Historiae of Herodotus; 2) select one of the availale editions
of the Historiae of Herodotus from the Perseus Digital Library. If we select and
submit tlg0016.tlg001.perseus–grc2, the system aligns the text of Hdt. 4.36 pub-
254 See section 2.3.1.
255 This algorithm is used also as part of the project Passim: https://github.com/dasmiq/pass
im/tree/master/src/main/java/JAligner.
256 For both collections see https://github.com/PerseusDL and http://opengreekandlatin.org.
On the FF1KG project, see Muellener (2019).
257 See, for example, fig. 4.23. If the icon Ĝ is not present, this means that there isn’t a text
in the FHG.

ley (Loeb 1921–1924): https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit/tree
/master/data/tlg0016/tlg001. The result of the detection shows the text of FHG
Hecataeus fr. 1 and the corresponding text highlighted in yellow in the edition of
the Historiae by Godley (fig. 4.38). The web page shows also the corresponding
passage of the Perseus XML file where an attribute @ana with the value "DFHG"
has been automatically added to the element <p> of the relevant passage (Hdt.
4.36.2) in order to mark up the presence of a fragment according to the FHG. The
modified Perseus XML file can be downloaded. The yellow highlighted passage
contains grey words that mean a difference with the text published in the FHG.
In this case there are the following differences: lowercase words (γελῶinstead of
Γελῶ), OCR errors and different words (νοονεχόντως instead of νόον ἔχοντας),
different accents (οἳinstead of οἵ), absence of punctuation (πέριξ instead of πέ‐
ριξ, and κυκλοτερέα instead of κυκλοτερέα,) and a different accent with absence
of a particle (τὴν instead of τήν τε.)258
An interesting case is when paragraphs in the FHG are different from those
of other editions. If we select Hdt. 2.143 (= FHG I, Hecataeus fr. 276) from the list
of passages shown in figure 4.23 and we compare the Herodotean passage of the
FHG with the edition of Godley, we see that text reuse detection is split into the
corresponding four paragraphs of chapter 143 of the second book of the Historiae
in the Loeb edition.259
258 As every distance algorithm, the Smith-Waterman Algorithm returns a percent score of
similarity that detects similarities between two strings. This percent score has to be inter-
preted by determining a threshold value for evaluting if the requested text is detected or
not. After a series of experiments, the threshold value was set to 0.2.
259 Possible inconsistencies in the results of text reuse detection are due to the inconsistencies
of the structure of the XML files that are aligned with the requested FHG text passages.

Another example is when Karl Müller classifies the first part of the first
paragraph of chapter 46 of the Alexander of Plutarch as fragment 64 of Ister (FHG I
427). In this case he also adds a reference to the edition of Plutarchus by Henricus
Stephanus that he was consulting (“Plutarch. Alexand. p. 691 Frf., 1267 ed. Steph.
seu cap. 46”). A comparison of this passage with the Perseus XML version of
the edition of the Alexander of Plutarch by Bernadotte Perrin (Heinemann 1919:
tlg0007.tlg047.perseus–grc2) reveals that Karl Müller was accepting the edition
of Stephanus that keeps the reading of the manuscripts where appears the form
Πολύκριτος. Later scholarship accepts the correction of this name with the form
Πολύκλειτος, which is also present in the edition of Perrin (fig. 4.39).260
As mentioned before, text reuse detection in the DFHG is performed not
only on texts of the Perseus Digital Library, but also on editions that have been
digitized as part of the Free First Thousand Years of Greek (FF1KG) initiative of
the Open Greek and Latin (OGL) project. Figure 4.40 shows the example of the
detection of fragment 2 of the Βοιωτιακά of Leo Byzantius (FHG II 330), which is
extracted from the De fluviis of Pseudo-Plutarchus (2.2).261
In its current state, text reuse detection in the DFHG project includes edi-
tions of ancient Greek sources and not of Latin sources, which can be in any case
detected by inserting the URL of an XML file of the requested Latin text. Fig-
ure 4.41 shows the example of the detection of fragment 27 of the Περσικά of
Dino (FHG II 94), which is extracted from the Vita Cononis of Cornelius Nepos
(5) and which has been obtained by inserting the URL of the XML version of
the Teubner edition (1886) of the Vita Cononis from the Perseus Digital Library:
phi0588.abo009.perseus–lat2.xml.262
Text reuse in the DFHG is performed on the following 158 editions of ancient
Greek sources:
– Aelian – De Natura Animalium
[tlg0545.tlg001.perseus–grc1] (PERSEUS)
– Aelian – Varia Historia
[tlg0545.tlg002.perseus–grc1] (PERSEUS)

260 For a discussion about the correction of the name, which is important for the identification
of the author mentioned by Plutarch, see Pearson (1960) 70–72, BNJ 128 F 8, and BNJ 334 F
26. Karl Müller publishes the fragments of Polycleitus of Larissa and of Polycritus of Mende
in one section of the Scriptores Rerum Alexandri Magni (129–133), where he suggests the
correction of Πολύκριτος with Πολύκλειτος in Plut., Alex. 46 (129 and 132 fr. 6).
261 In this case the OGL edition of the De fluviis is from the Geographi Graeci Minores of Karl
Müller (II 637–665): tlg0094.tlg001.1st1K–grc1.xml.

This list with links is available at http://www.dfhg-project.org/text_reuse_detec
tion/Witnesses_vs_Digital_Libraries.php. The list distinguishes between texts
from the Perseus Digital Library (PERSEUS) and texts from the Free First Thousand
Years of Greek (OGL).263 Links to these editions and their metadata have been
semi-automatically extracted from the GitHub repositories of the Perseus Digital
Library and of the Free First Thousand Years of Greek, because it is not possible
to completely automatize the process. For this reason and also considering the
fact that both projects are ongoing and still have to add many other editions of
Classical sources, the DFHG project will progressively add — as soon as available
— other witness sources to be analyzed as part of text reuse detection. As for
now, the aim is to show complexities and needs that help implement a model for
detecting text reuses of fragmentary authors in modern philological editions.
A problem is represented by the fact that parts of Perseus URNs that refer
to editions are not stable. This means that links to Perseus XML files currently
provided by the DFHG project may not work. For example, when the text reuse
detection functionality was released in 2018, the edition of Plutarch’s Alexander
by Perrin was accessible in the GitHub repository of the Perseus Digital Library
as tlg0007.tlg047.perseus–grc1.264 This same XML file is currently accessible
as tlg0007.tlg047.perseus–grc2 and not anymore as tlg0007.tlg047.perseus–

project provides a message in the case that Perseus URNs are not available.
263 For more information on these editions and their URNs, see the Perseus Catalog.

Figure 4.42 shows the example of the edition of Perrin, where users are in-
formed that tlg0007.tlg047.perseus–grc1 is currently not available. The DFHG
project provides also a web page with the 158 editions listed in the previous pages
that shows how many of them are not anymore accessible.266
Figure 4.42. DFHG Text Reuse Detection: error message
Another desideratum of the current state of research is to provide more digital
editions of Classical sources, which is particularly relevant in the case of histor-
ical fragments because they are preserved by texts that still need to be digitized.
In order to check how many editions of witness sources are still missing in the
Perseus Digital Library and in the Free First Thousand Years of Greek, the DFHG
project provides a Witnesses Catalog – Text Reuse Detection tool.267 This resource
aligns the Witnesses Catalog of the DFHG with the list of the above mentioned
158 editions that have been collected for text reuse detection. By searching an
FHG author, a witness author, or a witness work, it is possible to see how many
editions are currently available. For example, if we search the FHG author Is-
ter, it is possible to get a list of his FHG witnesses that are currently available
in a digital format for text reuse detection (fig. 4.43). If we choose one of the
available editions (e.g., Harpocration, Valerius – Lexicon in decem oratores Atticos
– tlg1389.tlg001.perseus–grc2), the system automatically detects all the frag-
ments of Ister in the selected edition (fig. 4.44).268
266 See http://www.dfhg-project.org/text_reuse_detection/Witnesses_vs_Digital_Libraries_c
heck.php. Red entries are currently not available.
267 http://www.dfhg-project.org/text_reuse_detection/xml_catalog_alignment.php
268 In this case it is the edition of the Lexicon of Harpocration by Wilhelm Dindorf (1853). If
a link to a Perseus XML file doesn’t work, an error message informs users who are invited
to check the current version of the file identifier in the Perseus Digital Library GitHub
repository.

The DFHG offers also an integration with the Digital Athenaeus project. As
described at p. 228 and when the witness work is the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus,
the DFHG Witnesses Catalog includes not only the icon Ĝ but also the acronym
DA, which stands for Digital Athenaeus (fig. 4.25). By clicking DA, it is possible
to visualize the requested fragment within the text of the Deipnosophists pub-
lished in the Digital Athenaeus.269 For example, if we search Phanodemus in the
Witnesses Catalog and we select fragment 1, by clicking DA a new window of
the Digital Athenaeus project opens where we can visualize a yellow highlighted
portion of a paragraph of the Deipnosophists (9.47) that corresponds to the text
extracted by Karl Müller and published as fr. 1 of Phanodemus (fig. 4.45).270
Finally, the DFHG project provides an experimental alignment of the DFHG
Witnesses Catalog with the entire corpus of the 158 XML files of the Perseus Digital
Library and the Free First Thousand Years of Greek: http://www.dfhg-project.org/t
ext_reuse_detection/xml_catalog_corpus_alignment.php. In this case, text reuse
detection can be performed on the entire corpus by searching an FHG author, a
witness author, and a witness work (e.g., Plutarchus [witness author]).271
4.4.6 Thesaurus and Named Entity Recognition
As described in section 4.3.4, one of the main goals of the DFHG project is to
integrate the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum with external resources such as
textual collections, authority lists, indices, dictionaries, lexica and gazetteers. As
part of this goal, the DFHG aims at creating a complete Thesaurus of ancient
Greek texts of the FHG and perform Named Entity Recognition (NER).272
e Thesaurus. The FHG is a complex philological edition with many differ-
ent elements that are expressed in three languages: Greek, Latin, and French.273
Greek is the language of most of the fragments, Latin is the language of a smaller
portion of fragments, academic Latin and French are the languages of transla-
tions and commentaries. Thanks to the creation of a textual database, the DFHG
project can extract texts of the ancient sources published in the FHG. In terms of
data, the entire DFHG is constituted by a total of 2,315,700 tokens with 337,833
unique forms. The DFHG database field text contains a total of 730,384 tokens
269 See section 5.3.1.
270 The text of the Deipnosophists in the Digital Athenaeus is based on the Teubner edition of
Georg Kaibel: see section 5.3.

with 115,199 unique forms.274 If we select the type fragment for the databse field
text, we have a total of 684,977 ancient Greek tokens with 91,754 unique forms,
of which 56,553 forms have been lemmatized with 12,928 lemmata. The goal of
the FHG is to extract ancient Greek tokens from the field text (type fragment and
extant text) and build a Thesaurus. Ancient Greek fragmentary historiography
collects quotations and text reuses of lost historical texts that covered many dif-
ferent aspects of local traditions and antiquities, and therefore fragments preserve
a rich vocabulary that is usually not contained in dictionaries. This is the reason
why these fragments are an important resource to expand and improve digital
lexica and dictionaries. Every source in the DFHG database field text has been
tokenized in order to produce stable URNs of each word and to lemmatize each
inflected form through Morpheus. Ancient Greek lemmata are used to interrogate
external resources like the Suda On Line and the Liddel-Scott Lexicon in the CITE
Architecture.275 One of the purposes of producing a thesaurus is for detecting
Named Entities (NEs) in the fragments, by which we mean proper names such as
personal names, work titles, and geographical names.
Ǚ Named Entity Recognition. In this regard, the DFHG project is work-
ing on named entities recognition and on the creation of a complete DFHG the-
saurus by including other external authority lists. Figure 4.46 shows an example
with some of the DFHG occurrences of the Greek word Εὐρώπη, which is both a
personal and a place name. The lemmatization of the inflected forms automati-
cally identifies the word both in the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (LGPN) and
in Pleiades. A further work of analysis of the contexts of the DFHG fragments,
where this word appears, provides an overview of the use of Εὐρώπη in Greek
historiography both as a personal and a place name.276

4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
4.5 Digital Marmor Parium
As described at p. 129, the appendix of the first volume of the Fragmenta Histori-
corum Graecorum contains the editions of the Parian Marble and of the Greek text
of the Rosetta Stone. The DFHG database includes not only both documents as
part of the collection, but has also developed two independent projects: the Dig-
ital Marmor Parium and the Digital Rosetta Stone. The goal of these two projects
is to analyze and represent both inscriptions in a digital environment. The Digi-
tal Marmor Parium provides not only images and drawings of the stone, but also
digital data about named entities (geographical and personal names), chronolog-
ical expressions, and linguistic information preserved by the text of the Parian
Marble.277
The project concentrates on the following aspects: 1) character encoding of
ancient Greek in epigraphical texts with a focus on Attic acrophonic numerals;
2) contribution to the EpiDoc Guidelines for the inclusion of further elements
and characteristics of ancient Greek inscriptions to be encoded in XML; 3) digital
representation of ancient Greek chronological data; 4) Named Entity Recognition
and Annotation of ancient Greek personal and geographical names; 5) linguistic
annotation of epigraphical texts in ancient Greek; 6) reading and description of
images of the Parian Marble.
The following sections describe the inscription of the Marmor Parium and
data produced by the Digital Marmor Parium project according to the following
topics: 1) EpiDoc XML encoding of the Marmor Parium (4.5.2), 2) the geography
of the Marmor Parium (4.5.3), 3) onomastics and prosopography of the Marmor
Parium (4.5.4), 4) the chronology of the Marmor Parium (4.5.5), 5) linguistics of
the Marmor Parium (4.5.6), and 6) images of the Marmor Parium (4.5.7 and 4.5.8).
4.5.1 The Marmor Parium
The Parian Marble (IG XII 5, 444) survives in two fragments:278
– Fragment A (ll. 1–93). This fragment arrived at the palace of the Earl of
Arundel in London in 1627 after being probably purchased in Smyrna. The
upper part (ll. 1–45: fig. 4.47) is now lost and known thanks to the tran-
scription published by John Selden in the Marmora Arundelliana (London
1628–1629: 1–14 and 59–119).
277 The project is available at http://www.digitalmarmorparium.org. See Berti/Stoyanova
(2014), Berti (2016c), and Berti/Almas et al. (2016).
278 For a recent and detailed description of the Parian Marble, of the discovery of its fragments,
and of scholarship about them, see Rotstein (2016) 1–15.

263
Figure 4.47. IG XII 5, 444, fr. A1
The surviving portion (ll. 46–93: fig. 4.48) is displayed in the Ashmolean
Museum of the University of Oxford.
– Fragment B (ll. 1–34). This fragment (fig. 4.49) was discovered on the island
of Paros in 1897 and is currently preserved in the Archaeological Museum
of Paros.
The author of the text of the Parian Marble is unknown, but the date of the com-
position can be fixed after 264/63 BC thanks to the mention of the name of the
Athenian archon Diognetos (l. 3). The stone includes a list of events from the
reign of Cecrops (1581/80 BC) to the archonship of Euctemon (299/98 BC) with
a main focus on the Athenian history (fig. 4.50). Events are arranged in para-
graphs that present a very similar format, which includes a short description of
the event, the name of the Athenian king or archon, and the number of years that
elapse from 264/63 BC.
In the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum, Karl Müller published the text of
fragment A of the Marmor Parium following the edition of August Boeckh in the
Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum (2374). The text is preceded by an introduction
(introductio), is accompanied by a Latin translation and chronological tables, and
followed by an extended commentary (annotatio): FHG I 533–590.
The digital version of the FHG edition of the Parian Marble is available
in the DFHG main page, where the inscription is represented according to

(epochae): part I (0–24) and part II (25–78).279
Figure 4.51 shows the exam-
ple of the event (epocha) number 3, which is about the trial between Ares
and Poseidon on the Areopagus over Halirrhothius. The URN of the event is
urn:lofts:fhg.1.marmor_parium.i:3.280 The DFHG main page presents the Greek
text of the event with the Latin translation and the commentary provided by
Müller, together with parallel chronological data that in the printed edition are
inserted in four columns beside the commentary.281 The icon c below number
3 allows to automatically perform Part-of-Speech tagging of the text through the
OpenNLP POSTagger for Ancient Greek (see p. 165). The gray sidebar on the left
allows to open and consult the corresponding page of the printed edition of the
text available in Google Books.
4.5.2 EpiDoc XML Encoding of the Marmor Parium
The entire DFHG text of the Marmor Parium is accessible and exportable to a CSV
file and to two different XML files: 1) a well formed XML file; 2) a TEI EpiDoc XML
279 Epocha and the plural epochae (or the corresponding transliterated forms from the Greek
ἐποχή) are the terms used in the 19th and 20th century editions of the Marmor Parium to
refer to the events described in the inscription.
280 On data citation in the DFHG, see section 4.3.5.
281 FHG I 543. The four columns correspond to 1) the number of the year expressed in the
Marmor Parium, 2) the corresponding year according to the Julian calendar, 3) the corre-
sponding Olympic year, and 4) the corresponding Athenian king or archon.

Given that one of the goals of the DFHG project is to go beyond the printed
collection edited by Karl Müller and connect its data with external resources,
other editions of the Marmor Parium have been digitized to include also fragment
B that was discovered in Paros in 1897 after the publication of the Fragmenta
Historicorum Graecorum.285
As of 2021, three editions have been encoded according to the EpiDoc Guide-
lines (version 9.1):286 IG XII 5, 444, FGrHist 239, and Rotstein (2016) 21–38. The
text of the Inscriptiones Graecae is the first critical edition of the complete Parian
Marble and was published in 1903. The year after, Felix Jacoby published a new
edition of the stone in his Habilitationsschrift, that was later superseded in 1929
by his own other edition in the second part of Die Fragmente der griechischen
Historiker (Zeitgeschichte).287 Finally, in 2016 Andrea Rotstein published a new
edition of the Parian Marble based on her autopsy of the fragments of the stone
284 https://github.com/DFHG-project/volume_1/blob/master/data/epidoc_xml/MARMOR_P

From an encoding point of view, the Parian Marble has interesting charac-
teristics that have been addressed as part of the implementation of the EpiDoc
Guidelines.289 First of all, being a chronicle, the text includes chronological data
in the form of Attic acrophonic numerals and names of Athenian kings and ar-
chons. The system of the so called Attic acrophonic numerals contained six sim-
ple symbols (that, except for 1, derived from the first letters of the ancient Greek
words that the symbols represented) and four compounds:

The system was used only for cardinal numerals and symbols were combined
with an additive notation in descending order (see table 4.2).290 The author of the
text of the Parian Marble used only the following simple acrophonic numerals
and compounds for purposes of chronology, because he wanted to express the
number of years that elapsed from 264/63 BC and the age of people mentioned in
the text of the stone:291

lmarmorparium.org/bibliography.html. I’m very grateful to Andrea Rotstein for her
permission to encode in XML her edition of the Parian Marble. I’m also grateful to her
for a meeting at the Ashmolean Museum of the University of Oxford on the occasion of a
presentation of the Digital Marmor Parium project that I gave for the Oxford Ancient History
Seminar on Digital Classics on March 3, 2015. The podcast of the seminar is available at
http://www.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/digital-classics-digital-marmor-parium. As part of
the integration of the DFHG project with the Jacoby Online (section 2.1.2), the text of the
Marmor Parium edited by James Sickinger for BNJ 1 and currently reviewed for BNJ 2 will
be soon converted into EpiDoc XML and added to the Digital Marmor Parium repository.
289 I’m very grateful to Gabriel Bodard, Charlotte Rouché, and Simona Stoyanova for helpful
and fruitful discussions about the encoding of the Parian Marble.
290 For a detailed description of the system of acrophonic numerals with examples, see Keil
(1894) 253 n. 1, Tod (1911–1912), Larfeld (1914) 291–293, Tod (1926–1927), Tod (1936–1937),

MP A1, 3: Ἀφ᾿οὗδίκη Ἀθήνησι [ἐγέ]νετο Ἄρει καὶΠοσειδῶνι ὑπὲρ

The EpiDoc community has addressed this kind of numeral and chronological
notation, which is marked up in XML in the following way:293

As it is possible to see in this example, the EpiDoc Guidelines allow to repre-
sent both the type of numeral ("acrophonic") and the chronological information
(1531/30 BC) associated to it according to the dating method of the Parian Marble
292 The text is from the edition of Rotstein (2016) 38: “From the time a trial occured in Athens
between Ares and Poseidon over Halirrhothius, Poseidon’s son — hence the place was
called Areopagos — 1268 years (= 1531/0 BCE), when Cranaus was king of Athens.” See
Jacoby (1904) 136–137, FGrHist 239A, BNJ 239, Harding (2008) 33–36. On the complexities
of the chronology of the Marmor Parium and on its ambiguities, see Maddoli (1975) 51–61.
From now onwards and unless specified, events of the Marmor Parium are cited according
to the numbers of the edition of Rotstein (2016): MP A1 (0–29), A2 (30–80), B (1–27).

("#marmor_parium"). The kind of calendar that is adopted has to be declared in the
header (<teiHeader>) of the EpiDoc XML file within the element <calendarDesc>:

In the attributes @from and @to of the element <date>, the normalised Gregorian
dates are used according to the encoded edition, in the W3C four-digit format,
with an hyphen (-) for BC dates ("-1531" and "-1530"). The number of years
expressed in the text of the Marmor Parium is a value ("1268") of the attribute
@when-custom, which is used for a non-standard dating system. The attribute
@datingMethod explains the dating system ("#marmor_parium") and points to the
calendar declaration in the header of the XML file. The element <num>, which in-
cludes the acrophonic numeral, doesn’t have a @value attribute because the value
of the number is already expressed in details in the element <date>.
The author of the text of the Marmor Parium uses acrophonic numerals to
express also ages of people, like for example the age of Aeschylus at the time of
the battle at Marathon:294
MA A2, 48:
ἀφ’ οὗἡἐμ Μαραθῶνι μάχη ἐγένετο Ἀθηναίοις

294 The text is from the edition of Rotstein (2016) 44: “From the time the battle in Marathon
occured, the Athenians (fighting) against the Persians and Ar[taph]e[rnes], Darius’s
neph[ew, an]d [Da]tis the commander, which the Athenians won, 227 years (= 490/89 BCE),
when [Ph]a[i]n[i]p[pid]es t[h]e second was archon in Athens. In this battle fought Aeschy-
lus the poet, being 35 years of age.” See Jacoby (1904) 112, Maddoli (1975) 33, and Harding
(2008) 102. There are twelve references to ages in the text of the Parian Marble: MP A2,
48 (Aeschylus), 56 (Sophocles), 57 (Simonides), 59 (Aeschylus), 60 (Euripides), 63 (Euripi-
des), 64 (Sophocles), 66 (Socrates), 69 (Philoxenus), 76 (Timotheus); B, 11 (Aristoteles), 15
(Theophrastus).

In this example, acrophonic numerals are used to express the date of the battle
at Marathon (ΗΗΔΔ𐅃ΙΙ = 227) and the age of Aeschylus (ΔΔΔ𐅃= 35). Also in
the second case, the EpiDoc Guidelines allow to specify the type of chronological
information ("age") and the corresponding number in Arabic numerals (35).296
In the XML files showed above, the Greek Acrophonic Attic Five (𐅃) and the
Greek Acrophonic Attic Fifty (𐅄) are represented with their corresponding HTML
numeric codes &#x10144; and &#x10143;. The reason is due to the fact that, even
if both characters belong to the Unicode block Ancient Greek Numbers in the Sup-
plementary Multilingual Plane, not every font supports them.297 In the XML files
of the Digital Marmor Parium project, three acrophonic numerals of the text of
the Parian Marble are represented with the following HTML numeric codes:
𐅃
Greek Acrophonic Attic Five
&#x10143;
𐅄
Greek Acrophonic Attic Fifty
&#x10144;
𐅅
Greek Acrophonic Attic Five Hundred
&#x10145;
This is an issue also for web browsers, where the web page stylesheet needs to
load a font that includes a graphic representation (glyph) of the UTF codes of
Unicode Ancient Greek Numbers. Figure 4.52 shows the example of epocha 3 in
295 https://github.com/DigitalMarmorParium/EpiDoc/blob/master/rotstein_2016.xml
296 The values of the attribute @type for the text of the Marmor Parium in the EpiDoc XML
version of IG XII 5, 444 are "age" for a person’s age (epochae 48, 56, 60) and "life-span" for
the age at death (epochae 59, 63, 64, 66, 69, 76, 112, 116). The attribute @dur, that expresses
durations of time, includes values that follow rules codified in the W3C Recommendation
on Datatypes. On the use of this attribute for the text of the Marmor Parium, see also the
examples of the following pages.
297 See https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10140.pdf: Unicode Standard, Version 13.0. On
character encoding for ancient Greek and on Unicode, see Tauber (2019). Solutions have
been also discussed and partly found for typesetting Greek Attic numerals with LATEX: see
Syropoulos (1997), Beccari (2002), Beccari (2016), Syropoulos (2018).

272

the DFHG main page. In this case the font used by the web page to represent
the text doesn’t support the Greek Acrophonic Attic Fifty (𐅄), which is therefore
substituted by a placeholder that shows the corresponding Unicode code.
Figure 4.52. DFHG main page: first version with default font
Figure 4.53. DFHG main page: Safari web browser version 13.0.4 (15608.4.9.1.3)
This problem has been solved by choosing a font that contains glyphs of Unicode
Ancient Greek Numbers and by embedding it into the web page with Greek and
Greek Extended languages.298 Figure 4.51 shows the correct representation of the
Greek Acrophonic Attic Fifty (𐅄) in the current version of the DFHG main page.
Some web browsers have representation problems also with a suitable font. For
example, macOS Safari is not able to represent Unicode Ancient Greek Numbers
rendering the web page, even if it correctly shows them in the HTML code. Figure
298 In this case the Google font Noto Serif has been chosen.

4.5 Digital Marmor Parium
273
4.53 shows the example of epocha 21 of the Parian Marble in the DFHG main page,
where both the Greek Acrophonic Attic Five Hundred (𐅅) and the Greek Acrophonic
Attic Fifty (𐅄) are represented with two empty squares in the web page (upper
part of the figure) and with the correct glyphs in the code inspection window
(lower part of the figure). Attic acrophonic numerals that express dates in the
Parian Marble are accompanied by names of Athenian kings and archons, who
are encoded as prosopographical data according to the EpiDoc guidelines.299 An
example is the event concerning the foundation of Syracuse:300
MP A2, 31: ἀφ’ οὗἈρχίας Εὐαγήτου δέκατος ὢν ἀπὸΤημένου ἐκ
Κορίνθου ἤγαγε τὴν ἀποικίαν [καὶἔκτισε] Συρακού[σσας, ἔτη - - -
β]α[σι]λεύ[ο]ντος Ἀθηνῶν Αἰσχύλου ἔτους εἰκοστοῦκαὶἑνός.
The following lines show the EpiDoc XML encoding of the event:
1 <seg type="entry" n="31">ἀφ’ οὗ<persName><name>Ἀρχίας</name> <persName
><name>Εὐαγήτου</name></persName></persName> δέκατος ὢν ἀπὸ<

Αἰσχύλου</name></persName>, <date type="office−span" dur="P21Y">
ἔτους εἰκοστοῦκαὶἑνός</date>.</seg>
In this case the name of the Athenian king Aeschylus is encoded as a personal
name (<persName>) like the names of Archias son of Euagetes and Temenus, who
are mentioned in the same passage.301
299 The exception is the name of the archon of Paros, which is partly lost ([]υάνακτος) and
mentioned in the first paragraph of the stone together with the name of the Athenian
archon Diognetos.
300 The text is from the edition of Rotstein (2016) 42: “From the time Archias, son of Euagetes,
being tenth from Temenus, led the settlement from Corinth [and founded] Syracu[se, . . .
years], when Aeschylus w[a]s [k]ing of Athens, in his twenty-first year.” See Jacoby (1904)
94–95.
301 As recommended by EpiDoc (version 9.1), the nested element <name> is used to encode
not only individual names, but also subparts of personal names. For the text of the Parian
Marble, the nested element <name> is used for names of fathers and, in three cases, for the
name of the mother (MP A1, 12), of the uncle (MP A2, 48), and of the grandfather (MP
A2, 49). Another question is about the encoding of the ordinal number of homonymous
archons, as for example Κριτίου τοῦπροτέρου in MP A2, 36, where τοῦπροτέρου can
be included in the element <persName> used to mark up the name of the archon Critias.
Another possibility is to include τοῦπροτέρου into a <genName> element, even if the risk is
to imply a familial relationship and lineage that are not applicable in this case.

274
4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
The Personal names and prosopographical links section of the EpiDoc Guide-
lines (version 9.1) describes also solutions for specifying the class of name (@type),
the orthography and the primary reference form (@nymRef), and the identifier (@ref)
with a URL or a URI of a personal name in order to connect it with an entry in
person databases or online prosopographies.302
Future developments of the Digital Marmor Parium project will also provide
these kinds of data, whose production still depends on an agreement in the com-
munity of Classicists about the terminology of classes of ancient Greek names,
on the annotation and the lemmatization of ancient Greek named entities (NEs),
and on the subsequent creation of authority lists. In this respect, the Digital Mar-
mor Parium project already offers the encoding of the inflected forms of personal
names of different editions of the Parian Marble in the above described XML files
and a complete list of Latinized lemmata of these names.303 The annotation and
encoding of these forms and their corresponding lemmata depend not only on
the development of standards and on a discussion in the community of experts,
but also on the complexities of ancient texts. The Parian Marble is a fragmented
stone with gaps and ambiguous readings. As of today and from a technical point
of view, these complexities can be represented in a digital environment, but their
encoding, analysis, and annotation require time, editorial efforts, and contribu-
tions by epigraphists, philologists, and linguists that will be possible only thanks
to the work of future generations of scholars.
The EpiDoc XML example cited above shows also the encoding of the year
of Aeschylus’ reign (21st) that corresponds to the event of the foundation of Syra-
cuse:
1 <supplied reason="lost">βασι</supplied>λεύ<supplied reason="lost">ον</
supplied>τος Ἀθηνῶν <persName><name>Αἰσχύλου</name></persName>, <
date type="office−span" dur="P21Y">ἔτους εἰκοστοῦκαὶἑνός</date>
This encoding is in accordance with the Dates, dating formulae, ages section of the
EpiDoc Guidelines (version 9.1). Technically, also the name of Aeschylus could
be specified with a reference to his role of dating archon with the attributes @type
and @role:
302 In the EpiDoc XML file of IG XII 5, 444, the attribute @type of the element <persName> has
been experimentally used with the value "divine" for ten occurrences of names of divine
beings, in order to distinguish them from names of human beings.
303 The list is available in the Google Drive spreadsheet DMP Chronological Table of the Digital
Marmor Parium project and is arranged by Athenian kings, Athenian archons, and other
names: see section 4.5.5.

When both the acrophonic numeral and the name of the Athenian archon (or
king) are preserved, two possibilities have been discussed in the EpiDoc com-
munity.304 An example is the date when Croesus sent envoys and offerings to
Delphi:305
MP A2, 41: ἀφ’ οὗΚροῖσος [ἐξ] Ἀσίας [εἰς] Δελφοὺς ἀ[- - - ἔτη
Η]Η[𐅄]ΔΔΔΔΙΙ, ἄρχοντος Ἀθήνησιν Εὐθυδήμου.
The first possibility is to include the name of the archon in the element <date>
and add the attribute @role in the <persName> element, so that both elements of
the formula can be extracted together:
1 <date from="−0556" to="−0555" when−custom="292" datingMethod="#
marmor_parium"><num type="acrophonic">ΗΗ&#x10144ΔΔΔΔΙΙ;</num>,
ἄρχοντος <placeName>Ἀθήνησιν</placeName> <persName type="archon"
role="dating"><name>Εὐθυδήμου</name></persName></date>
The second possibility is to use two different <date> elements for the acrophonic
numeral and the name of the archon, and nest them into a bigger element<date>:
1 <date>
2 <date from="−0556" to="−0555" when−custom="292"
3 datingMethod="#marmor_parium"><num type="acrophonic">ΗΗ&#x10144ΔΔΔΔΙΙ;<
/num></date>,
4 <date from="−0556" to="−0555" when−custom="292"
5 datingMethod="#marmor_parium">ἄρχοντος <placeName>Ἀθήνησιν</placeName>
<persName type="archon" role="dating"><name>Εὐθυδήμου</name></
persName> </date>
6 </date>
304 I’m very grateful to Charlotte Rouché and Simona Stoyanova for this discussion. These
possibilities are not yet part of the EpiDoc Guidelines, but are the result of ongoing dis-
cussions about the complexities of encoding epigraphical texts.
305 The text is from the edition of Rotstein (2016) 43: “From the time Croesus . . . [from]
Asia [to] Delphi, 292 [years] (= 556/5 BCE), when Euthydemus was archon in Athens.” See
Jacoby (1904) 106–107.

276
4 Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum
Other chronological data, that can be currently encoded in EpiDoc XML, are
months and days. An example is the event about the conquest of Troy:306
MP A1, 24: ἀφ᾿οὗΤροία ἥλω, ἔτη 𐅅ΗΗΗΗΔΔΔΔ𐅃, βασιλεύον-
τος Ἀθηνῶν [Μενεσθέ]ως δευτέρου <καὶεἰκοστοῦ> ἔτους μηνὸς
Θ[αργηλιῶ]νος ἑβδόμηι φθίνοντος.
The following lines show the EpiDoc XML encoding of the event, where the Attic
month Thargelion and the number of the day (7) can be marked up within the
element <date> and with specific attributes:
1 <seg type="entry" n="24">ἀφ’ οὗ<placeName>Τροία</placeName> ἥλω, ἔτη <
date from="−1208" to="−1207" when−custom="945" datingMethod="#

αρ<lb n="40" break="no"/>γηλιῶ</supplied>νος <num value="7">
ἑβδόμηι</num> φθίνοντος</date>.</seg>
Still open are questions about the encoding of collective nouns (e.g., τῶν Ἰδαίων
Δακτύλων in MP A1, 11 and ὁΠερσῶν βασιλεὺς in MP A2, 42), of groups of people
from the same family (e.g., τῶν πεντήκοντα Δαναίδων in IG XII 5, 444, ep. 9), and
of the incomplete restoration of dates (e.g., ibid., ll. 57, 59, and 81).
4.5.3 The Geography of the Marmor Parium
The EpiDoc Guidelines allow to encode also places mentioned in the text of
the Marmor Parium. An example is the event concerning the death of the poet
Aeschylus:307
MP A2, 59: ἀφ’ οὗΑἰσχύλος ὁποιητής, «βιώσας ἔτη 𐅄Δ𐅃»ΙΙΙΙ, ἐτε-
λεύτησεν ἐγ [Γέλ]αι τῆς Σικελίας, ἔτη Η𐅄ΔΔΔΔΙΙΙ, ἄρχοντος Ἀθή-
νησι Καλλέου τοῦπροτέρου.
The following lines show the EpiDoc XML encoding of the event, where Γέλαι
and Σικελίας are marked up within the element <placeName>:
306 The text is from the edition of Rotstein (2016) 41: “From the time Troy was conquered, 945
years (= 1209/8 BCE), when [Menesthe]us was king of Athens, in his <twenty> second year,
in the month of Th[argeli]on, in the seventh day, (counting) from the end of the month.”
See BNJ 239.
307 The text is from the edition of Rotstein (2016) 45: “From the time Aeschylus the poet, being
69 years of age, died in [Gel]a on Sicily, 193 years (= 456/5 BCE), when Calleas the elder
was archon in Athens.”

The text of the Parian Marble is rich of other occurrences that can be classified
in the group of geographical terms, like mountains (e.g., τὸν Παρνασσὸν: MP A1,
2), tribunals (e.g., Ἀρείωι Πάγωι: MP A1, 25), ethnics (e.g., ὁΦρὺξ: MP A1, 10),
and names of people (e.g., Ἀθηναίους: ibid.). Beside the element <placeName>, the
EpiDoc Guidelines include also the elements <orgName> and <geogName> to mark
up these examples. Moreover, the attribute @nymRef can be added with a URL or
a URI that points to local databases or online authority lists and gazetteers such
as Pleiades.
In terms of place names and instead of marking them up within the same
XML file, another possibility is to annotate them externally. In this regard, the
Pelagios Network has been developing and maintaining Recogito, which is an on-
line platform for collaborative document annotation and visualization.308 Recog-
ito has been used to experiment with the annotation of places in the text of the
Marmor Parium. Recogito enables users to annotate places, persons, and events,
but the annotations of the Marmor Parium are for now limited to places, given
that the goal is to focus on the “geography” of the incription.309 The plain text
(.txt extension) of the edition of the Marmor Parium published in IG XII 5, 444
has been uploaded in Recogito in order to perform manual annotations.310
308 See Simon/Barker et al. (2017), and Bodard/Gheldof et al. (2016) (Paper 2. Early Geographic
Documents and the Pelagios Commons).
309 Place, Person, and Event are part of the Recogito vocabulary. On the complexities of defining
and annotating historical places, locations, and names, see the Pleiades website.
310 The text has been taken from the collection PHI Greek Inscriptions: https://epigraphy.pack
hum.org/text/77668. On this collection, see p. 69.

Figure 4.54. Recogito: document view with annotations of the Marmor Parium
Figure 4.54 shows the Document view of Recogito with the text of the Marmor
Parium that preserves the lign arrangement of the printed edition of the IG with
place annotations highlighted in green and in yellow.311 The document is acces-
sible through a Recogito account and is provided with a URL that allows to link
it also without logging in Recogito: https://recogito.pelagios.org/document/uyn
xk84uyyizck. Metadata of every annotated place is visible in a pop-up window
that shows the corresponding entry of the place in Pleiades with its URI, a brief
description, a map, and the possibility to edit the annotation and add a commen-
tary and tags. The hyperlink of the URI points to the relevant page in Pleaides,
where it is possible to obtain geo-coordinates and further information about the
annotated place (in this case Athenae = pleiades:579885).
311 The arrangement of the printed edition of the IG and consequently of PHI don’t correspond
to the actual arrangement of lines on the stone and numbers of line have been added by the
editor of the IG to show the correspondence. As for now, the text in Recogito doesn’t include
line numbers, which can be easily obtained through the text in the PHI collection. The
annotation of places of the Marmor Parium was originally performed in the Summer 2014,
when Recogito was still limited to the annotation of places and when it was not possible
to annotate words written between two lines of the inscription. This functionality is now
active and places between lines have been added to the annotation.

4.5 Digital Marmor Parium
279
In order to produce an annotation, the user has to highlight the relevant
word or words. At this point and if available, Recogito automatically offers a
list of places that match the annotation and the user can select one of them. If
not available, Recogito gives the possibility to search the place in its gazetteers
and select the desired option.312 Given that the Marmor Parium is a fragmented
inscription and the text of the IG edition is full of editorial critical signs, this
function doesn’t always work and places have to be manually searched.313
As of 2021, 267 entities (occurrences) have been annotated in the text of the
Marmor Parium.314 Five entities have been flagged and are not verified, because it
has not been possible to find a correspondent Pleiades URI or because their data
are not present in the gazetteers made available through Recogito:315 τοῦΔιὸ[ς
τ]ο[ῦ] [Ὀλυ]μ[πί]ου τὸἱ[ερ]ὸν, Ἄρειος Πάγος, Καδμεί-αν, Ἀρεί[ωι] Πάγωι, and
Κυβέλοις. According to the Annotation statistics provided by Recogito, a total of
142 unique places of the Marmor Parium are resolved.316 Table 4.3 shows a list of

312 As of 2021, Recogito makes available the following gazetteers: Pleiades (Pleiades Gazetteer
of the Ancient World), CHGIS (China Historical GIS), DPP Places (Places from the Digitizing
Patterns of Power project), DARE (Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire), MoEML (Map of Early
Modern London), HGIS de las Indias (Historical-Geographic Information System for Spanish
America, 1701–1808), GeoNames (A subset of GeoNames populated places, countries and first-
level administrative divisions), Kima (Kima Historical Gazetteer).
313 Editorial critical signs have been kept in Recogito because they have to be considered part
of the annotation.
314 Entity is the term used in Recogito. Names of people like Ἀθηναῖοι or Ἕλληνες have not
been annotated. As mentioned above, editorial critical signs and hyphens of words be-
tween two lines of the inscription are part of the annotated text. The context also allows
to disambiguate forms like ἄστ[ει (pleiades:579885), πόλις ἑλληνίς (pleiades:59672), and
νήσου (pleiades:707498).
315 The first and the last entities don’t have a Pleiades URI, while the other three have a Pleiades
URI that is not retrievable through Recogito. In these cases the color of the annotation is
yellow and the toponym is flagged. The verbs flag and verify are Recogito terms, like resolve
(see below).

Recogito provides also a Map view to visualize annotated places on different
Base Maps: https://recogito.pelagios.org/document/uynxk84uyyizck/map.
Empty Basemap (geographically accurate basemap of the ancient world by the
Ancient World Mapping Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); An-
cient Places (Roman Empire base map by the Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire,
Lund University, Sweden); Modern Places (modern places and roads via Open-
StreetMap); Aerial (aerial imagery via Mapbox). Figures 4.55 and 4.56 show an-
notated places of the Marmor Parium on an Empty Basemap and on an Ancient
Places map of the Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire. In terms of data, Recog-
ito allows users to download annotations and data to different formats, such as
CSV, RDF (JSON-LD, RDF/Turtle, RDF/XML), GeoJSON, KML (beta), TEI/XML,
Markdown (beta), IOB (beta), and Spacy JSON (beta) (fig. 4.57).
4.5.4 Onomastics and Prosopography of the Marmor Parium
The text of the Marmor Parium is a rich collection of personal names related to
the events described in the chronicle. In order to get an estimate and on the basis
of the edition of the Inscriptiones Graecae (XII 5, 444), names of kings, archons,
and other people have been provisionally extracted from the Marmor Parium and
listed according to their Latinized form.318 These names are available in different
sheets of the DMP Chronological Table Google Drive spreadsheet (p. 294). Tables
4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 show how 14 Athenian kings, 64 Athenian archons, and 193 other
names are distributed in the text of the Marmor Parium:

As described in section 4.5.2 concerning the EpiDoc Guidelines, personal names
can be encoded in XML with elements and attributes that specify roles and point
to external authority lists. As for geographical terms, it is also possible to anno-
tate personal entities outside of the XML file adopting ontologies for representing
relationships ad prosopographies.
In this regard, the Standards for Networking Ancient Prosopographies
(SNAP:DRGN) project is using Linked Open Data (LOD) to build a virtual au-
thority list for ancient people through aggregation of common information from
collaborating projects: “A unified authority of ancient persons will serve as a
convenient and powerful single resource for prosopographers, text editors and
scholars to use for disambiguating person references by means of annotations
that record the specific URI of a person identified by the SNAP graph. The graph
will provide: 1) identifiers for all persons who appear in one or more corpora and
catalogues; 2) gold standard normalization data for parsing and proofing tools;
3) visualization of ancient persons, names, titles and relationships; 4) research
tools for historians; 5) standards and software contributing to the Linked Ancient
World Data community.”319
As stated by the editors of the project, the goal is not to produce new uni-
versal datasets of historical persons, but create “single entry point — and related
identifier — coupled with a small subset of common fields made available both to
human researchers and for automated processing,” in order to facilitate “interop-
319 The quotation is from the website of the SNAP:DRGN project, about which see Bodard/
Gheldof et al. (2016) (Paper 1. Networking Ancient Person-data: community building and
user studies around the SNAP:DRGN project) and Bodard/Cayless et al. (2017). On Linked
Ancient World Data, see Cayless (2019).

erability and interchange, exploitation and discovery through common metadata,
and the recording of both known and newly discovered relationships between
person records. Users will be enabled and encouraged to (a) annotate their data
with SNAP URIs to disambiguate person references, and (b) add structured com-
mentary to the SNAP graph in the form of scholarly assertions, bibliography and
apparatus.” (Bodard/Gheldof et al. (2016) 44).
The model of SNAP is based on a simple structure that uses Web and LOD
technologies to represent relations between databases and link references in pri-
mary sources to authority lists of persons and names. The core of the project
is based on three large historical prosopographies and onomastica from the an-
cient world: 1) the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, 2) Trismegistos, and 3) Proso-
pographia Imperii Romani. SNAP:DRGN is an ongoing project and the SNAP
Cookbook is the result of discussions and meetings concerning the complexities of
prosopographical materials, in order to “set out details of several scenarios for the
encoding, publication and linking of ancient person data in RDF, and connecting
them to the SNAP graph.” (Bodard/Gheldof et al. (2016) 45).
As far as the Digital Marmor Parium project is concerned, the first step is to
annotate and lemmatize the names listed above in the original language and in
different editions according to standards and practices of Named Entity Recog-
nition, and cite them with identifiers of the LGPN database.320 Through these
identifiers, entities of the Digital Marmor Parium project will be part of the SNAP
graph and linked to other resources.
4.5.5 The Chronology of the Marmor Parium
As described in sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2, the Marmor Parium is a selection of events
whose chronology is expressed with numbers of years elapsing from 264/63 BC
and with eponymous kings and archons. This data is encoded according to the
EpiDoc Guidelines as part of the Digital Marmor Parium project. A comprehen-
sive view of the chronology of the Marmor Parium is available through the DMP
Chronological Table Google Drive spreadsheet (fig. 4.58).321
This table is based on the text of IG XII 5, 444 and compares chronologies of the
Marmor Parium in the form of Gregorian calendars as they have been interpreted
and published in the editions of the FGrHist and the IG.322
320 On NER for ancient Greek and on the use of the LGPN database in the Digital Athenaeus
project, see section 5.6.
321 The Google Drive Spreadsheet is available at https://bit.ly/2TdSRQ3 (view only).
322 Events are arranged as A(a) 0–29, A(b) 30–80, and B 1–27. As mentioned in the previous
section, the table includes also sheets with the names of the Athenian kings, Athenian
archons, and other people mentioned in the inscription.

4.5 Digital Marmor Parium
295
Figure 4.58. Digital Marmor Parium: chronological table
As for geographical and personal data, also chronological data can be annotated
and visualized externally. A possibility for the future is to represent chronological
data with Graph of Dated Objects and Texts (GODOT), which is a graph database
system that aims at creating and maintaining a gazetteer of calendar dates in
different calendar systems, initially those used in Greek and Roman antiquity
across the Mediterranean area, and provide links to attestations of these dates
in online editions.323 This possibility and related issues were discussed on the
occasion of the Epigraphy Edit-a-thon: Editing Chronological and Geographic Data
in Ancient Inscriptions, that I organized at the Universität Leipzig in 2016, and will
be part of future work of the Digital Marmor Parium project.324
As for now, an experiment has been conducted with TimelineJS to represent
the Gregorian chronology of events and kingship of fragment A (ll. 1–45) of the
Marmor Parium as listed in Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (fig. 4.59).325
323 See https://godot.date/. See also PeriodO, which is a public domain gazetteer of scholarly
definitions of historical, art–historical, and archaeological periods that eases the task of
linking among datasets that define periods differently and also helps scholars and students
see where period definitions overlap or diverge: https://perio.do. On these projects, see
Grieshaber (2016), Rabinowitz/Shaw et al. (2018), and Grieshaber (2019).
324 Berti (2016a).
325 The timeline is available at http://www.digitalmarmorparium.org/chronology.html. The
text of the visualization is based on the text of IG XII 5, 444. This experiment was performed
by Stella Dee while working as a research fellow at the Alexander von Humboldt Chair of
Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig.

4.5.6 Linguistics of the Marmor Parium
Events in the Parian Marble are arranged in sections that are characterized by a
very similar format and language. Experiments are currently being performed
to annotate the morphology and the syntax of the inscription according to the
guidelines of the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2.0. Annotations of the first
fifteen sections of the text have been produced by Giuseppe G.A. Celano at the
University of Leipzig and can be visualized through the online editor Arethusa
(fig. 4.60).326 In this case, main peculiarities are due to the fact that the text is
fragmentary and with gaps, and that the language depends on the epigraphical
nature of the chronicle. Morpho-syntactic annotations of inscriptions are not yet
part of the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2.0 guidelines, but they are a work
in progress of the community and part of the Digital Marmor Parium project is to
contribute to them in the future.327
4.5.7 Drawings and Images of the Marmor Parium
The surfaces of the surviving fragments of the Marmor Parium are unfortunately
very damaged and it’s now difficult to obtain better readings of the text than those
already published.328 Nevertheless, digital technologies may help scholars access
the two documents and analyze them on the screen. This is the reason why the

in particular to Charles Crowther for welcoming me during a visit to the Museum in the
Spring 2015 on the occasion of a presentation of the Digital Marmor Parium project that
I gave for the Oxford Ancient History Seminar on Digital Classics (see p. 268 n. 288). For

A first visit to the Archaeological Museum of Paros in the Summer 2015
allowed me to inspect fragment B of the Marmor Parium and plan a future visit in
order to take high resolution pictures of the stone.331 Drawings and images will
be used in the future not only for a better reading of the inscription, but also for
their annotation and alignment with transcriptions of the text.332

4.5.8 RTI Scans of the Marmor Parium
The Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) technique has been used to scan
the surface of fragment A of the Parian Marble preserved in the Ashomolean
Museum of the University of Oxford.333 I’m very grateful to Charles Crowther,
Lindsay MacDonald, and Nick Pollard for providing me with the RTI scans that
are available through the Digital Marmor Parium website. RTI scans have been
processed in order to be visualized in HTML pages of the Digital Marmor Parium
project using the WebRTIViewer (fig. 4.61).
331 I’m very grateful to Yannos Kourayos, Director of the Archaeological Musem of Paros, for
facilitating my autopsy of fragment B of the Parian Marble during my visit to Paros.
332 In this respect, the model is the Homer Multitext project of the Center for Hellenic Stud-
ies. For experiments and projects with students, annotations of images are now possible
through the platform Recogito: on the platform and for tutorials, see p. 277.

4.6 Digital Rosetta Stone
After the edition and the commentary to the Parian Marble, the first volume of
the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum prints also the Greek text of the Rosetta
Stone (Marmor Rosettanum) with a French literal translation and a commentary
by Jean-Antoine Letronne (see p. 129).
The inscription is part of the DFHG database, is accessible through the
slide in/out navigation menu of the main page, and is provided with the URN
urn:lofts:fhg.1.marmor_rosettanum. The online version follows the structure of
the printed edition.334 After the Avertissement, there are 54 lines (lignes) with the
Greek text, the French translation, and the corresponding commentary (commen-
taire critique, historique et archéologique). Each line of the Marmor Rosettanum is
aligned with the translation and the commentary, is linked to the entries of the
FHG Index Marmoris Rosettani, and the Greek text can be automatically parsed
with the OpenNLP POSTagger for Ancient Greek.335 As for the Digital Marmor
Parium, the DFHG has started a separate project to experiment with the analysis
and the representation of the Rosetta Stone in a digital environment. The descrip-
tion of this project is out of the scope of this book and I provide here only a very
short introductory presentation of it.
The Digital Rosetta Stone (Der Stein von Rosette digital) is a project developed
in collaboration with the Institute of Egyptology at the University of Lepzig for
producing a digital edition of the Rosetta Stone with textual alignment, transla-
tion alignment, and morpho-syntactic annotation of the three scripts of the stone
(fig. 4.62).336 This initiative started thanks to the support of StiL (Studieren in
Leipzig), which is a project of the University of Leipzig developed in the frame
of the Bund-Länder-Programms “Qualitätspakt Lehre” supported by the German
Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The Digital Rosetta Stone
was financed as part of the 7. Projektkohorte der LaborUniversität for the aca-
demic year 2017/2018 with an extension to the academic year 2019/2020. This
project was also one of the reasons why Franziska Naether and I were awarded
the Theodor-Litt-Preis 2018 of the University of Leipzig.
The main goal of the project was to integrate research on the Rosetta Stone
into the teaching activites of the courses in Digital Humanities, Digital Philology,

collaborated also with The Rosetta Stone Online developed as a cooperation of the German
Excellence Cluster Topoi and the Department of Archaeology of the Humboldt-Universität
zu Berlin: http://rosettastone.hieroglyphic-texts.net.

          Egyptology meets Computer Science : 
      The Digital Rosetta Stone Project  
https://rosetta-stone.dh.uni-leipzig.de 
Wer sind wir? 
„The Digital Rosetta Stone“ ist ein Verbundprojekt des Ägyptologischen 
Instituts und des Lehrstuhls für Digital Humanities an der Universität Leipzig. 
Gefördert 
wird 
das 
Vorhaben 
als 
Lehr-Lernprojekt 
durch 
das 
Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung im Rahmen von „StiL – 
Studieren in Leipzig“. Als Kooperationspartner fungieren die Humboldt-
Universität zu Berlin sowie das British Museum in London. 
Im Fokus stehen einerseits  die Sprachen des Steins von Rosette 
(Hieroglyphisch, Demotisch und Altgriechisch) und andererseits sein 
Textinhalt. Als Lehr-Lern-Projekt ist damit ein didaktischer Hintergrund 
verknüpft – nämlich der Erwerb von Textkompetenz, d. h.: 

Sprachkompetenz (Vokabular, Grammatik, Syntax; Interlinear-
glossierung) 

Wissensaktivierung (Abruf, Vertiefung, Erweiterung) 

Texttransformation (Interpretation des Inhaltes durch komplexe 
Sinnstrukturen) 

Textkritik (wissenschaftlicher Umgang mit Textübersetzungen). 
 
Verschiedene Werkzeuge aus dem Bereich der Digital Humanities sollen 
diesen Prozess unterstützen: 

Erlernen der Sprache: Alignment 

Morpho-syntaktische Strukturen (Textkomposition): Treebanking 

Darstellen von Schrift ohne Unicode: Bildverknüpfung. 
 
Ziel ist eine digitale Textedition, die die Methoden aus der Ägyptologie, der 
Klassischen Philologie und der Digital Humanities miteinander verknüpft. 
Laufzeit: 01.10.2017–30.09.2018. 
Was ist die Rosettana? 
Der Stein von Rosette ist ein Synodaldekret aus der Regierungszeit 
Ptolemaios V. Epiphanes (204-180 v. Chr.) und wurde am 27. März 196 v. 
Chr. aufgesetzt. Das Dekret ist in drei Schriftsprachen abgefasst: 
Hieroglyphisch (x+14 Zeilen, 707 Wörter), Demotisch (32 Zeilen, 2305 
Wörter) und Altgriechisch (54 Zeilen, 1505 Wörter). 
Der Stein ist ein Granodiorit, wiegt 762 kg und ist heute 114,4 cm hoch, 
72,3 cm breit und 27,93 cm stark. Ursprünglich war der Stein ca. 150 cm 
hoch. Der obere Teil sowie die rechte untere Ecke sind abgebrochen. 
Das Artefakt wurde während der Expedition Napoleons 1798/99 in der 
ägyptischen Hafenstadt el-Rashid entdeckt und befindet sich heute in 
London im British Museum (Inv.-Nr. EA 24). Es ist eines der berühmtesten 
Altertümer. Seine Bedeutung wird jedoch meist auf den Durchbruch 
innerhalb der Entzifferungsgeschichte der Hieroglyphen beschränkt. 1822 
arbeitete J.-F. Champollion (1790-1832; Abb. 5) dieses Schriftsystem 
anhand der Rosettana und einer Obeliskeninschrift aus und teilte dies in 
einem Brief an Bon-Joseph Dacier mit (Abb. 6).

Was steht drin? 
Die Beschlüsse der Priestersynode anlässlich der Krönung Ptolemaios‘ V. in 
Memphis beinhalten: Steuererleichterungen, Zugeständnisse an die 
Priesterschaft, Amnestie für Inhaftierte, Bestätigung von Tempelbesitz, 
wirtschaftliche Vergünstigungen, Niederschlagung von innerägyptischen 
Aufständen, Hinrichtung der Rebellen, Steuererlass, Sorge um Tierkult und 
Tempelausstattung seitens des Königs. Darüber hinaus wurden dem König 
und seinen Ahnen Ehren zuteil (Statue, Kult, Feste) und den Priestern ein       
neuer Titel verliehen. 
                                                                                                                          
 
Was ist textual Alignment? 
Vorarbeiten: Der griechische Texte der Rosettana ist im Rahmen der Leipzig 
Open Fragmentary Texts Series (LOFTS) übersetzt und annotiert worden. 
Für den hieroglyphischen Teil wurde ein Test-Alignment mit dem Tool 
Alpheios (https://alpheios.net/) erstellt. 
Das Alignment stellt eine Wort-Verknüpfung dar, die den Erwerb einer 
Sprache und den Sprachvergleich digital unterstützt. Im Projekt ist dafür die 
von Tariq Yousef entwickelte Software Ugarit iAligner (http://ugarit. 
ialigner.com/index.php) verwendet worden. 
 
 
 
 
Abb. 1: Alignment Demotisch – Deutsch. 
 
Das Programm bietet die Möglichkeit, bis zu drei Sprachen miteinander zu 
vergleichen. Die sich entsprechenden Wörter werden per Mausklick 
ausgewählt und miteinander verknüpft. Abb. 1 veranschaulicht diese 
Wortverknüpfung am Beispiel §39 (= Zeile 25) des demotischen Textes der 
Rosettana. Es kommen 1:1, 1:n, n:1 und n:n Beziehungen zwischen den 
Sprachen vor. 
Die drei Schriftsprachen des Dekretes sind jeweils einzeln mit dem iAligner 
bearbeitet worden. Dafür ist im Vorfeld jeder Textteil satzweise zerlegt 
worden. Um die drei Sprachen zu vergleichen, die jeweils den gleichen 
Text wiedergeben, ist im Rahmen des Projektes eine Synopse erstellt 
worden. Diese diente als Grundlage für ein zweites Alignment, das sich 
entsprechende Satzteile in den Blick nimmt (Abb. 2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abb. 2: Alignment Hieroglyphisch – Demotisch – Griechisch. 
Wie wird visualisiert? 
Da es für das Hieroglyphische und das 
Demotische noch kein Unicode gibt, sind für 
ihre Darstellung Fotos notwendig. Bei der 
Bildverknüpfung, 
basierend 
auf 
der 
Berechnung von Vektoren, können die 
Textdaten des Alignments mit der Schrift auf 
dem Foto verlinkt werden. Im Endergebnis ist 
auf 
dem 
Foto 
der 
Rosettana 
jeder 
zugewiesene Satz farblich markiert (Abb. 3).

1988: The Rosetta Stone Facsimile Drawing). 
Was ist Treebanking? 
Die im Projekt gesammelten Daten und Annotationen zur Grammatik und 
Syntax der drei Texte sollen mit Hilfe des Treebanking-Verfahrens optisch 
abgebildet werden. Testweise ist dies mit dem griechischen Text im Tool 
Arethusa (http://www.perseids.org) zuvor versucht worden: Die Syntax 
wird  als  Baumstruktur  ausgegeben. Weiterhin  können  zu  den  Wörtern

grammatische 
und 
morphologische 
Informationen abgerufen werden. Diese 
entstammen der Glossierung des Textes.

and Egyptology that are taught at the University of Leipzig by Franziska Naether
and myself. The result was the collaboration between a graduate student of Digi-
tal Humanities and Linguistics (Miriam Amin) and a PhD candidate of Egyptology
(Josephine Ensel), who produced digital data on the Rosetta Stone. The work con-
sisted in a complete new transcription of the text, in the alignment of the Hiero-
glyphic, Demotic, and Greek versions of it, and in the alignment with the German
translation of the inscription originally provided by Heinz-Josef Thissen.337 The
alignment was produced with the web-based platform Ugarit iAligner and the
result has been aligned with a new high-resolution picture of the stone.
The project produced also the complete morpho-syntactic annotation of the
Greek version of the inscription according to the Ancient Greek Dependency Tree-
bank 2.0, and work is in progress to expand the annotation to the Egyptian ver-
sions of the text and provide a tagset.
Part of the project has been also devoted to take new high resolution pictures
of the Rosetta Stone. This task was accomplished thanks to the collaboration with
the British Museum of London and with the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology
Project at the University of Florida.338 Even if the inscription is one of the most
famous objects from antiquity, high resolution pictures were still missing in order
to obtain a better reading of the three scripts, and especially of the Hieroglyphic
and Demotic sections. On June 28, 2018, 191 pictures of the stone were taken
with quadri-directional lighting (figg. 4.63 and 4.64).339 It was employed a shape-
from-shading technique to highlight the text and reconstruct in 3D the shape of
the inscribed surface.340 The goal is to provide a deep reconstruction of the stone.
Figure 4.65 shows an experiment with the left upper part of the Rosetta Stone,
which is one of the most difficult areas of the inscription. Work is in progress for
combining the pictures and provide the community with the final result.
337 The Hieroglyphic and Demotic versions are reprensented in transliteration, given that com-
plete Unicode is not available.
338 The project is very grateful to Ilona Regulski for facilitating the access to the Rosetta Stone
in the British Museum and to Angelos Barmpoutis and Elena Bozia for providing the equip-
ment and taking the pictures.

5 Digital Athenaeus
This chapter describes the Digital Athenaeus, which is a project that provides
an inventory of authors and works cited in the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus
of Naucratis and implements a data model for identifying, analyzing, and
citing uniquely instances of text reuse. The first section (5.1) describes char-
acteristics of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus and its role as a cover-text of
many citations of Classical authors. The second section (5.2) introduces
the Digital Athenaeus project. The third section (5.3) describes editions of
the Deipnosophists that are currently available in a digital format and how
the Greek text of this work can be accessed (5.3.1) and searched (5.3.2) in
the Digital Athenaeus project. The fourth section (5.4) describes data cita-
tion applied to the text of the Deipnosophists and two resources that have
been created as part of the project: the Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter
(5.4.1) and the CTS URN Retriever (5.4.2). The fifth section (5.5) describes
the production of the digital version of four indices of the Deipnosphists
(5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 5.5.4) and their alignment with the Greek text in order to
map their entries on to the text of Athenaeus (5.5.5 and 5.5.6). The sixth
section (5.6) describes Named Entity Recognition applied to the text of the
Deipnosophists, the production of a digger (5.6.1) and a concordance (5.6.2)
to access named entities in Athenaeus, and methods for their annotations
(5.6.3).
5.1 The Deipnosophists as a Cover-Text
The Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis is not only an erudite and liter-
ary encyclopedia of a myriad of curiosities about classical antiquity, but also an
invaluable collection of quotations of ancient authors, ranging from Homer to
tragic and comic poets and lost historians.1 Since the large majority of the works
cited by Athenaeus is nowadays lost, this compilation is a sort of reference tool
1
Athenaeus of Naucratis is almost unknown. The Byzantine lexicon Suda (Α 731, s.v. Ἀθή-
ναιος) describes him as coming from the Egyptian city of Naucratis, being a grammarian,
and living in the time of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Athenaeus presents himself as par-
ticipating in the banquets described in the Deipnosophists with other twenty-two sophists
(cf. section 5.5.3). He offers the account of the conversations to his friend Timocrates.

for every scholar of Greek theatre, poetry, historiography, botany, zoology, and
many other topics.2 The text has been transmitted in two different forms: 1) a
10th century mutilated copy of the original work (Marcianus Graecus 447), where
the first part of the text until the third book (Deipn. 73e = 3.4) and other scattered
folios are lost; 2) an epitome of the whole work in four copies (Parisinus Suppl.
Gr. 841; Laurentianus LX.2; BM Bibl. Regia 16.D.X; Erbacensis 4).3
Figure 5.1 shows folio 124 (verso) of the main manuscript of the Deip-
nosophists, which is preserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana of Venice
(Marc. Gr. 447).4 The image shows one of the peculiarities of the manuscript,
which is enriched with marginalia constituted by scholia, lemmata, and notes.5 In
this case margins include the following lemmata and notes that concern authors
and topics cited by Athenaeus in a passage of the seventh book about the cut-
tlefish, the squid, and red mullets (Deipn. 324a–f = 7.124–125):6 Ἱππῶναξ (324a),
ἐξήγησις Ἱππώνακτος (324a), Ἐρασίστρατος (324a), Γλαῦκος (324a), Ἀρχέστρα-
τος (324b), Ἀριστοφάνης (324b), Ἄλεξις (324b), περὶτρίγλης καὶκίχλης (324c), ὅτι
εἰκὸς τὴν τρίγλη‹ν› διὰτὸτρὶς τίκτειν οὕτως κεκλῆσθαι (324d), and ὅτι κυφὰς αὐ-
τὰς Ἐπίχαρμος καλεῖ(324e). The marginalia in Athenaeum are a rich collection
of ancient annotations to the text of the Deipnosophists, that show and confirm
the importance of this work as a “cover-text” of a huge mine of quotations and
text reuses of Classical authors.7
The Index Scriptorum of the edition of the Deipnosophists by Georg Kaibel
lists 809 entries, while the index of authors (repertorio degli autori e dei luoghi
citati) of the edition of the Deipnosophists by Luciano Canfora lists 897 entries.8
In order to estimate a proportion of the number of authors cited by Athenaeus, the
online Canon of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (2019) includes ca. 1,700 authors
for the period of time between the 8th century BC and the 3rd century CE, and a
total of ca. 3,300 authors up to the 20th century and including varia and incerta.9
Morevoer, citations in Athenaeus are precise and structured because they contain
references to author names (often with additional elements about geographical

numbers, and distinction among different editions of the same work.10 All these
characteristics make the Deipnosophists a reference resource for exploring the
language used by ancient authors to cite other authors and works.

5.2 The Digital Athenaeus Project
The Digital Athenaeus is a project that provides scholars with experimental tools
for accessing the text of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis and getting
information about citations of authors and works that are preserved in it (fig. 5.2):
http://www.digitalathenaeus.org.11 The reason for choosing this work is due to
its importance as a rich collection of quotations and text reuses (fragmenta) of
ancient Greek authors who belong to many different literary genres.12 The Deip-
nosophists offers the opportunity to experiment with a new way of representing
fragmentary texts inside their context of transmission, which is the main concern
when collecting evidence about reused authors and works. Textual fragments are
a form of hypertext and a digital environment permits to annotate and visualize
10
Cf. Jacob (2001).
11
The project is currently developed and expanded thanks to a new Deutsche Forschungsge-
meinschaft (DFG) grant that I was awarded to work on Text-based Extraction, Analysis, and
Annotation of Ancient Greek References to Authors and Works (project number 434173983).

them as reuses within their context. This possibility allows to go beyond the lim-
its of printed editions, where extended chunks of texts conserving fragmenta of
other texts are extracted, decontextualized, and reprinted in other editions.13
The Digital Athenaeus aims at providing an inventory of authors and works
cited by Athenaeus and at implementing a data model for identifying, analyzing,
and citing uniquely instances of text reuse in the Deipnosophists. This means
extracting and annotating a wide variety of elements that pertain to text reuse,
such as names of quoted authors, titles and descriptions of quoted works, and in
general the language of the text reuse itself. The Greek text of the Deipnosophists
in the Digital Athenaeus is based on the Teubner edition of Georg Kaibel (1887–
1890) and the project is producing tools and services for reading the text and
generating text reuse related data that are described in the following pages.14
5.3 Accessing the text of the Deipnosophists
As of today, the reference edition of the Deipnosophists is still represented by
Kaibel (1887–1890). The three volumes of this edition are out of copyright and
available in public collections like Internet Archive. The EpiDoc XML file of the
Greek text of this edition is available as part of the canonical–greekLit GitHub
repository of the Perseus Digital Library, where Athenaeus of Naucratis and the
Deipnosophists are registered as tlg0008 and tlg0001, and the edition of Kaibel as
perseus–grc3.xml.15 XML files of the complete edition of Georg Kaibel are avail-
able as part of the Open Greek and Latin project and include not only the Greek
text, but also introductions, indices, and the critical apparatus.16 The Perseus
13
Cf. pp. 83 ff.
14
Tools and services are available through the homepage of the project with detailed de-
scriptions and instructions. The Digital Athenaeus is not producing a new critical edition
of the text of the Deipnosophists, because this is not the scope of the project and because
this task is currently undertaken by Douglas S. Olson: see p. 314 n. 32 and cf. Magnani
(2018) 88–89.
15
See https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit/blob/master/data/tlg0008/tlg00
1/tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-grc3.xml. The string perseus–grc3 is not a stable identifier. It is
therefore recommended to check the Perseus Catalog and possible updates of the GitHub
repository. On this problem in relation to the DFHG project, see p. 255. On TLG identifiers,
see p. 19 n. 55. On the use of these identifiers in the Perseus Catalog, see Babeu (2019).

See http://opengreekandlatin.github.io/athenaeus-dev/. These XML files were produced
by the data entry company Digital Divide Data (DDD), who corrected and encoded the
OCR output generated by Bruce Robertson in accordance with the latest EpiDoc standards.
They are part of athenaeus–dev, whose –dev(elopment) suffix indicates that the repository
is open to improvement and that the files still need OCR post-correction. This data has
been used by the Digital Athenaeus project for the creation of the digital versions of the
indices scriptorum of the Deipnosophists: see section 5.5.

5 Digital Athenaeus
Digital Library provides also the Greek and the English translation of the Deip-
nosophists from the edition of Gulick (1951–1957) in two separate EpiDoc XML
files (perseus–grc4.xml and perseus–eng2.xml). The same repository includes also
the English translation of Yonge (1854) (perseus–eng3.xml).17 Finally, the com-
plete text of the four volumes of the edition of Meineke (1858–1867) is available
as a machine-corrected version in the Open Greek and Latin repository.18
5.3.1 Greek Text
The Digital Athenaeus project is currently based on the Greek text of the Teubner
edition of Kaibel (1887–1890).19 The text is available through an Ajax web page
that is automatically generated by a PHP script: http://www.digitalathenaeus.o
rg/tools/KaibelText/index.php. The Ajax technique allows to load, visualize, and
navigate the entire text of the Deipnosophists in one single HTML page in order
to facilitate the usability of the resource (fig. 5.3).20
The slide in/out navigation menu, which is accessible through the bar icon
on the top left hand side of the header bar, represents the whole tree of the text
by books and paragraphs. The “Expand All” and “Collapse All” functions allow to
navigate through the text with a comprehensive view of the structure of the edi-
tion of the Deipnosophists by Kaibel. Every book and every paragraph of the text
have a CTS URN expressed according to the CITE Architecture, as for example:21
– urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus–grc2:3 (Deipn. 3)
– urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus–grc2:3.7 (Deipn. 3.7)
The icons on the left of each paragraph are links to external resources: r list icon
(automatic alignment of the Greek text of the Deipnosophists with entries of the
indices by August Meineke, Georg Kaibel, and S. Douglas Olson) and c tag icon
(POS tagging of the text through the OpenNLP POSTagger for Ancient Greek).22

Digital Athenaeus project for the creation of the digital versions of the indices scriptorum
of the Deipnosophists: see section 5.5
19
The text has been extracted from the Perseus EpiDoc XML file of the edition of Kaibel. At
the time of the creation of the Digital Athenaeus resource, the Perseus XML file was labelled
as perseus–grc2.xml, which is the string still used in the CTS URNs of the Digital Athenaeus
project (see below). In the GitHub repository of the Perseus Digital Library, the same XML
file is currently labelled as perseus–grc3.xml: see n. 15.

5.3.2 Search
In the Digital Athenaeus project the text of the Deipnosophists is searchable in two
different ways: 1) by holding down the SHIFT-key when highlighting words of the
Greek text of the Deipnosophists with the mouse; 2) by searching words directly in
the Search tool.23 When available, results display also Morpheus’ inflected forms
and lemmata, Suda’s entries, entries from the Liddell-Scott Lexicon in the CITE
Architecture and entries from the Named Entities Digger.24 Figure 5.4 shows a
screenshot with the example of the search of the form Περγάμου, whose lemma
Πέργαμος allows to interrogate external resources and obtain information about
the word form, its occurrence in the Suda, and its function as a Named Entity in
the text of the Deipnosophists.

5.4 Retrieving citations in the Deipnosophists
The first requirement for accessing the text of the Athenaues and for retrieving
his citations is to provide stable identifiers based on the CITE Architecture.25 This
is the reason why the Digital Athenaeus project has created two resources: 1) the
Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter (section 5.4.1) that converts Casaubon ref-
erences into Kaibel references and generates CTS URNs; 2) the CTS URN Retriever
(section 5.4.2) that allows to retrieve and cite paragraphs, passages, and words of
the Deipnosophists.
5.4.1 Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter
In spite of the debate about a possible division of the Deipnosophists into thirty
books, modern editors have been using two different systems for enumerating
and referring to the text of the fifteen books of Athenaeus.26 After the reference

5.4 Retrieving citations in the Deipnosophists
313
to the book number (1–15), the two systems differ in the division into paragraphs:
1. The first system dates back to the 16th century edition of Isaac Casaubon.27 This
system includes an arabic numeral that refers to the page of the edition of Casaubon
followed by a letter (A–F) corresponding to the subdivision of the page into sections
of about ten lines of text (e.g., 683b).28
2. The second system was used in the 19th century by Johannes Schweighäuser, Wil-
helm Dindorf, August Meineke, and Georg Kaibel in their editions of the Deip-
nosophists.29 In this system each book is logically divided into paragraphs corre-
sponding to units of sense and the paragraphs are referred to with arabic numerals
whose numeration starts again at the beginning of each book (e.g., 12.31).30
The system of Casaubon allows to cite short passages of text, but is not precise
because the letters A–F printed in the page margins are not perfectly aligned
with the Greek text, and it’s therefore not possible to identify with precision the
beginning and the end of a section.31
The imprecision of the numeration of Casaubon is problematic also from a
computational point of view and this is one of the reasons why the Thesaurus
Linguae Graecae adopts only “Kaibel paragraphs” for its online edition of the
Deipnosophists (Kaibel ed.: tlg0008.001). Kaibel paragraphs are truly canonical,
independent of any particular manifestation of the text; they apply equally well
across editions, and to translations. Causabon citations are by definition tied to
page-breaks in a particular edition and are therefore not logical, and do not serve
well as canonical citations for scholarship in a digital environment (even though
27
Casaubon (1597). For a description of the work of Casaubon on Athenaeus, see Arnott
(2000). 51–52.
28
Given that the pagination is continuous for the entire edition, this system doesn’t require
the reference to the book number. Well known examples of similar reference systems are
the so called Bekker pagination for the works of Aristoteles and the Stephanus pagination
for the works of Plato.
29
Schweighäuser (1801); Dindorf (1827); Meineke (1858–1867); Kaibel (1887–1890).
30
These editions preserve the numeration of Casaubon on the margin of each page in or-
der to facilitate the correspondence with their texts, but they use only the numeration of
Casaubon in the indices.
31
This is evident in every edition published after Casaubon, where Causaubon’s references
are still adopted but are often different. See, for example, Olson (2006–2012), vol. I, xvii:
“Casaubon’s pages are generally divided into six sections (a–f), which consist for the most
part of ten, or sometimes 11 lines of text; the f-sections may be longer or shorter than the
others, and are occasionally omitted, e.g. in the first page of a Book. Because Casaubon’s
indications of section-divisions are not neatly aligned with his Greek text, I have at times
been forced to guess as to where they should be placed. In addition, his sections fail to
take account not just of punctuation but even of word-division, and I have chosen to mark
them after the words in which they fall, so as to keep my text as readable as possible.”
On alterations of Casaubon’s numbering in some books of the Deipnosophists, see Olson
(2006–2012), vol. III, vi; vol. IV, vii; vol. V, vii.

they are traditional).32 Kaibel citations by book and paragraphs are well suited
to a digital environment, and in particular to the CITE Architecture.33 This is the
reason why they represent the “citation object” of the Digital Athenaeus project,
which is based on references expressed with CTS urns.
The goal of the Digital Athenaeus project is to annotate quotations and text
reuses preserved in the Deipnosophists to accomplish two main results: 1) provide
an inventory of authors and works cited by Athenaeus and 2) implement a data
model for identifying, analyzing, and citing uniquely instances of text reuse. The
project has therefore produced tools and applied methods for generating semi-
automatic annotations and references of text reuses.
The first result was the creation of digital versions of indices scriptorum pub-
lished in printed editions of Athenaeus to map their entries on to the text of the
Deipnosophists.34 These indices are based on the numeration of Casaubon. It was
therefore necessary to convert the numeration of Casaubon into the numeration
of Kaibel, in order to generate CTS URNs of the citations of these indices.
This is the motivation that brought to the creation of the Casaubon-
Kaibel Reference Converter, which is a tool that was still missing in the com-
munity of Classicists.35
This task was performed automatically thanks to
the Perseus EpiDoc XML file of the edition of the Deipnsophists by Charles
Gulick (tlg0008.tlg001.perseus–grc4), which contains the numeration of both
Casaubon and Kaibel.36 In this file Casaubon sections are marked up with the el-
ement <milestone>, while Kaibel books and paragraphs are marked up with the
element <div>. Below is an example of the beginning of the Deipnosophists in the
Perseus XML file (Casaubon 1a–f = Kaibel 1.1–2):37

Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016) 124–125. From now onwards I refer to the numeration of the
Deipnosophists by books and paragraphs as Kaibel system, because the edition of Kaibel is
still the reference edition for the work of Athenaeus. S. Douglas Olson is editing a new
edition of the Deipnosophists for the Bibliotheca Teubneriana: see Olson (2019) and Olson
(2020).

the numeration of Kaibel was added in the Perseus XML file.

The resulting concordance has been manually checked on the basis of the
edition of Kaibel and a database has been created to produce the online Casaubon-
Kaibel Reference Converter.38 In addition to the converter, a web-based Applica-
tion Programming Interface (API) has been produced to integrate data into ex-
ternal services (see below).39 The tool offers not only the concordance between
the two reference systems, but also links to the corresponding pages of the PDF
files of the printed editions of Casaubon (1597) and Kaibel (1887–1890), allowing
users to automatically read the requested reference in the original edition.40
Figure 5.6. Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter: page links
When the converter was released in 2015, the PDF of the edition of Casaubon was
available through the website of the Biblioteca de la Universidad de Sevilla, whose
links embedded the actual page numbers of the edition of Casaubon allowing an
automatic match with the converter.41 Figure 5.6 shows a screenshot of the code
inspection window of the Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter page with the ex-

Pages of the edition of Kaibel were manually inserted, because the EpiDoc XML file of
Perseus contains the edition of Charles Gulick with its page numbers, that are different
from those of Kaibel (see the element <pb> in the XML code showed above).

ample of the correspondence between Kaibel 3.33 (pages 201–202) and Casaubon
86f–87c.42 The window shows the links to the editions of Casaubon (1597) and
Kaibel (1887–1890) available through the Biblioteca de la Universidad de Sevilla
and Internet Archive:
– http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/3883/145/athenai-ou-deipnoso

– https://archive.org/stream/athenaeinavcrati01atheuoft#page/201/mode/1
up
As of 2020, the links to the website of Sevilla don’t point anymore to the Spanish
library, but to Internet Archive, where the edition of Casaubon is available as part
of the Fondo Antiguo de la Universidad de Sevilla.43 In this case, unfortunately,
the page numbers of the links don’t correspond to the edition of Casaubon and,
in order to generate the new corresponding links that are now available in the
converter, pages had to be manually searched or inferred from their sequence.44
An alternative solution is to link the Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter to
the edition of the Deipnosophists published by Casaubon in 1657, which is avail-
able through Google Books (Casaubon (1657) – Google ID: = ZvGCkzC6SkEC&hl =
https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvGCkzC6SkEC&hl). In this case the actual
page numbers of the edition are embedded in the URL of each page of the PDF.
For example, https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvGCkzC6SkEC&hl=de&pg=
PA179 includes the reference to Casaubon page 179.45
As anticipated before, the Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter provides a
web-based API with a JSON output for integrating data into external services.
The API can be queried with Casaubon or Kaibel references:46
api.php?ref_system=<casaubon/kaibel>&reference=<Casaubon/Kaibel Reference>

44
See https://archive.org/details/ARes28201. High quality color images of the edition of
Casaubon (1597) are available through the platform for digitized rare books from Swiss
libraries (https://doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-6872), but also in this case links don’t correspond
to the page numbers of the printed edition. At 11.466d of the edition of Casaubon (1597),
there is a lacuna in the text, because a few folios of codex A were lost and the text begins
again after 466e. The lacuna was filled in by Johannes Schweighäuser with the insertion of
the Supplementum Libri Undecimi that Casaubon obtained from the epitome contained in
the codices C ed E and inserted at the end of book 15 (Animadversiones in Athenaei Deip-
nosophistas, VI, 1804 466). This explains why, after 466d, there is a section that runs from
781b to 784d. After this section, starts again the numeration with 466d. In the Casaubon-
Kaibel Reference Converter this section is present, but links to the pages of the edition of
Casaubon are missing, because these pages are missing in the copy of the University of
Sevilla.

5.4 Retrieving citations in the Deipnosophists
321
5.4.2 CTS URN Retriever
The CTS URN Retriever is a tool for retrieving and citing paragraphs, passages, and
words in the text of the Deipnosophists by typing the corresponding CTS URN.47
The syntax of the URNs follows the specification of the CITE Architecture. For
example:
– Ath. Deipn. 3.7: urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus–grc2:3.7
– The second occurrence of the word βίβλου in Ath. Deipn. 1.1:
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus–grc2:1.1@βίβλου[2]
– The quotation of the words of Antiphanes (ἀεὶ
δὲ
πρὸς
Μού-
σαισι καὶλόγοις πάρει, ὅπου τι σοφίας ἔργον ἐξετάζεται) in Ath.
Deipn. 1.4: urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-grc2:1.4@ἀεὶ[1]–
ἐξετάζεται[1]
The tool allows also users to type only book and paragraph of the Deipnosophists
and get the corresponding CTS URN, as for example 13.7 (= Ath. Deipn. 13.7).48
Using CTS URNs, it is possible to export citations of the Deipnosophists down to
the word level.49
Figure 5.7. Digital Athenaeus: CTS URN Retriever
By selecting a portion of text holding down the ALT-key, users get a pop-up win-
dow with the CTS URN that identifies the selected chunk of text. For example,

See section 4.3.5 for the use of this function also in the DFHG project.

322

by selecting Ἀθήναιος μὲν ὁτῆς βίβλου πατήρ in Ath. Deipn. 1.1, it is possible to
obtain the corresponsing CTS URN (fig. 5.7).
5.5 Looking for Athenaeus’ Quotations
One of the goals of the Digital Athenaeus is to experiment with semi-automatic
annotations of data related to text reuse. This is the reason why the project
has produced digital versions of indices of authors and works published in the
printed editions of the Deipnosophists by August Meineke, Georg Kaibel, and S.
Douglas Olson.50 SQL databases of these indices have been created starting from
OCR outputs of the printed editions and have been enriched with automatically
converted Kaibel references and with links to external resources for reading the
whole context of each reference.51 Dynamic graphs generate graphic visualiza-
tions of the indices and web APIs with a JSON output allows to integrate data
into external services. These indices offer lists of author names and work titles
cited by Athenaeus and they can be considered as already disambiguated lists of
named entities (author names and work titles) to be mapped on to the text of the
Deipnosophists to obtain a first set of annotations pertaining to text reuse.52 The
following sections describe characteristics and functions of each of these indices.
5.5.1 Meineke – Index Scriptorum
This index is part of the third volume of the Teubner edition of the Deipnosophists
published by August Meineke in 1859 (Index Scriptorum).53 The index includes a
list of authors and works cited by Athenaeus and the digital version of it has been
created starting from the OCR output of the printed volume.54 The OCR output
has been parsed using bash scripts and manually corrected in order to create
50
Meineke (1858–1867); Kaibel (1887–1890); Olson (2006–2012).
51
For experiments with testing OCR of ancient Greek using different editions of the Deip-
nosophists, see Boschetti (2018) 11–29 with further bibliography.
52
This is not the case of the index by Olson (section 5.5.4), because it includes not only authors
but also other personal names (index of authors, texts, and persons). The Digital Athenaeus
offers also the Dialogi Personae by Georg Kaibel (section 5.5.3), because this is a list of the
names of the sophists who participate in the dialogues described by Athenaeus and who
actually quote other authors and works. On the history of indices and on the practice of
index-making, see Wheatley (1878).
53
Meineke (1858–1867), vol. III 452–499. Meineke published also an Index Rerum (283–452).
54
See http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/MeinekeIndexScriptorum/. The digitization
of the edition of Meineke has been performed as part of the Open Greek and Latin project:
see section 5.3.

This data has been further structured to extract Athenaeus’ book numbers and
convert Casaubon citations into Kaibel citations using the Casaubon-Kaibel Ref-
erence Converter (section 5.4.1). Roman numerals have been converted into Arabic
numerals and the entire index has been proofread to correct OCR errors.
The first interesting complexity is represented by the different lengths of
Casaubon sections and Kaibel paragraphs. For example, Kaibel 9.15 corresponds
to Casaubon 373a–e.57 On the other side, Casaubon 502b corresponds to Kaibel
56
In this example the entry doesn’t have data for the fields Characterization and Note, that
are filled in for other entries (see below).

5.5 Looking for Athenaeus’ Quotations
325
11.105–107.58 These differences between the two reference systems generate am-
biguities in the conversion of index references. For example, the automatic con-
version of the first Casaubon reference to Tryphon Alexandrinus in the Index
Scriptorum of Meineke (p. 498) results in two Kaibel paragraphs: 109b = 3.73
and 3.74. Only the reading of the text of the Deipnosophists permits to disam-
biguate the reference and see if the citation of Tryphon Alexandrinus corresponds
to Kaibel 3.73 or 3.74.
This is the reason why the Digital Athenaeus project has inserted an exper-
imental voting system to enable users to vote for ambiguous references. Figure
5.8 shows the example of Tryphon Alexandrinus in the online Index Digger of
the Index Scriptorum of Meineke, where the interface includes a Vote button to
enable users to vote and disambiguate the reference.59 This Vote functionality
is experimental, because further work for disambiguating references is currently
done through the automatic alignment of index entries with the Greek text of the
Deipnosophists and through Named Entity Recognition.60 Votes are collected in
the database of the Digital Athenaeus and their percentage is visible in the Index
Digger.61

Experiments on voting ambiguous references were done by students during the CHS Sum-
mer Internship in Publications at the Center of Hellenic Studies in Summer 2016 (see p.
245) and by Samantha Strickland from Furman University during her Fulbright fellowship
at the University of Leipzig in the Academic Year 2015/2016.

The second interesting complexity is represented by reference ranges. For
example, the sixth reference to Mnesimachus in the Index Scriptorum of Meineke
(p. 484) is Casaubon 402f–403d. This reference has been expanded and split into
the corresponding Casaubon sections, which are convertible into the following
Kaibel paragraphs: 402f = 9.67, 403a = 9.67, 403b = 9.67, 403c = 9.67, 403d = 9.67,
403d = 9.68. In order to preserve the range, the database of the Index Scriptorum
includes a field called Is_Range, whose records range start, range, and range end
keep track of reference ranges. Figure 5.9 shows the example of the range 402f–
403d as represented in the database. The Index Digger of the Index Scriptorum
represents the range by grouping references in a black rectangle, which is visible
in the example of Mnesimachus at figure 5.10.62
Figure 5.9. Meineke, Index Scriptorum: Casaubon reference range
Figure 5.10. Meineke, Index Scriptorum: Mnesimachus
62
The entry of Mnesimachus is available at http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/Meineke
IndexScriptorum/digger.php?what[]=Name|Mnesimachus&onoffswitch=on. Preserving
reference ranges is important, because this is a way for showing the extension of a citation
according to the interpretation of a scholar (in this case August Meineke).

5.5 Looking for Athenaeus’ Quotations
327
Greek and Latin expressions used by Meineke in his index have been pre-
served and entries have been structured to separate data in the following search
fields that are accessible through the Index Digger:63
– Name:
author name (e.g., Anaxandrides) and other index entries (e.g.,
Anonymi poetae);
– Ethnicon: place of origin of an author (e.g., Cnidius);
– Characterization: literary genre or profession of an author (e.g., medicus);
– Note: Meineke’s notes to name, ethnicon and/or characterization fields (e.g.,
vixit Sophoclis aetate);
– Work: work titles (e.g., Σικελικά);
– Sub Work: sub works or book numbers (e.g., γ΄);
– Athenaeus Book: book numbers of the Deipnosophists for each occurrence
(e.g., Book 7);
– Casaubon Reference: references to passages in the Deipnosophists where
authors and works are cited (e.g., 2.67e);
– Kaibel Reference: conversion of Casaubon references into Kaibel refer-
ences (e.g., 2.76);
– Note (Reference): Meineke’s notes to Casaubon references (e.g., conf.
Σύνδειπνοι).
Additional output fields allow users to vote and disambiguate differences between
Casaubon and Kaibel references, to read the text of the Deipnosophists corre-
sponding to each citation reference, and also to annotate quotations:
– Vote: disambiguate and vote the right correspondence between Casaubon
sections and Kaibel paragraphs (e.g., 573b = 13.31 and/or 13.32);64
– Read Greek Text (Perseus): link to the Greek text of the Deipnosophists in
the Perseus Digital Library;65
– Read Greek Text (FrontEnd UniLeipzig): link to the Greek text of the
Deipnosophists in the CTS FrontEnd of the University of Leipzig;66
– Annotate with Perseids: annotate quotations and text reuses with the Per-
seids Fragmentary Texts Editor.67
63
http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/MeinekeIndexScriptorum/digger.php
64
On the reason of this functionality, see p. 325.
65
The text of the edition of Kaibel (1887–1890) is published in the Perseus Digital Library:
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perse
us-grc2. Perseus visualizes only one paragraph per page and, in the case of ambiguous
Kaibel paragraphs, users have two open two windows to read both paragraphs and vote
the correct one.
66
See Reckziegel/Jänicke et al. (2016). In this case the tool allows to scroll through the entire
text of Athenaeus and therefore read paragraphs in their sequence.
67
On the Perseids editor, see section 3.3. Each passage of the Index Scriptorum can be opened
in the Fragmentary Texts Editor, but the annotation functionality is not anymore fully sup-
ported by Perseids.

Figure 5.12. Dynamic Graph (Meineke): Homerus
The Index Digger can be used also to obtain combined search results, as for exam-
ple: Name (Homerus) AND Work (Ὀδ.); Characterization (orator) AND Athenaeus
Book (Book 13); Work (Ἱππεῖς) OR Work (Εἰρήνη).
The digital version of the Index Scriptorum offers also a Dynamic Graph to
produce a graphic visualization of index data.68 Results in the Dynamic Graph
can be obtained by filtering data using the following filter fields:
– Name:
author name (e.g., Anaxandrides) and other index entries (e.g.,
Anonymi poetae);
– Ethnicon: place of origin of an author (e.g., Cnidius);
– Characterization: literary genre or profession of an author (e.g., medicus);
– Work: work titles (e.g., Γαστρονομία);
– Sub Work: sub works or book numbers (e.g., δ΄).
The following are examples of filtered search results with their correspond-
ing links to the Dynamic Graph: Work + Name (Homerus) (fig.
5.11); Name +
Characterization (comicus); Name + Characterization (comicus) (limited to the
first 10 results). Results of the Dynamic Graph are visualized through Highcharts,
can be printed, and can be downloaded as PNG image, JPEG image, PDF document
and SVG vector image. It is also possible to hide/show graphs by selecting/des-

electing entries in the list at the right of the chart, and visualize the number of
occurrences in each book of the Deipnosophists by hovering the mouse over the
selected book (fig. 5.12).
The Digital Athenaeus provides also a Web API with a JSON output of Index
Digger queries of the Index Scriptorum of Meineke:69
api.php?what=<search string>&where=<search field>&exact=[yes:no]
Search fields of the Web API can be one of the following:

book,
casaubon_reference,
kaibel_reference, note_reference.
For example, if we want to visualize

This list is arranged according to the order in which these expressions appear in the Index
Scriptorum of Meineke, and data has been extracted from the database field Work of the
digital version of the index. As far as possible, these entries respect the language used
by Meineke, but there are cases where information about internal divisions of works has
been extracted and stored in the field Sub Work (e.g., the expression ἐν δευτέρῳπερὶτῶν
ἐν Δελφοῖς ἀναθημάτων under the entry of Alcetas at 453 of the index). On this aspect see

An interesting aspect of the work done by August Meineke is the effort to preserve
the original Greek forms used by Athenaeus in the Deipnosophists to refer to titles
and descriptions of works and to their internal divisions.73 The forms listed in the
previous pages are those printed in the Teubner edition of Meineke. Sometimes
they appear in an abbreviated form because references to book numbers and other
internal divisions have been separated and stored in the database field Sub Work.74
73
This aspect is also present in the indices of Georg Kaibel (sections 5.5.2 and 5.5.3), but not
anymore in those published by Douglas S. Olson (section 5.5.4).
74
An example is the expression ἐν τῷπρώτῳτῶν τῆς Ἀσίας Σταθμῶν that is part of the index
entry of Amyntas (p. 456) from Ath., Deipn. 500d (= 11.102). The expression has been split
into τῶν τῆς Ἀσίας Σταθμῶν (Work) and ἐν τῷπρώτῳ(Sub Work).

Future work of the Digital Athenaeus project plans two different tasks: 1)
align these forms with the Greek text of the Deipnosophists in order to automat-
ically annotate them in the context75 and 2) lemmatize these forms and create
entries for a complete text-based catalog of the works cited by Athenaeus.
Finally, the following 117 unique expressions are used by Meineke to char-
acterize authors in his index:76
Academicus (3) - actor scenicus (1) - Aegypti vectigalibus ab Alexandro praefectus (1) - Agesarchi

5.5.2 Kaibel – Index Scriptorum
This index is part of the third volume of the Teubner edition of the Deipnosophists
published by Georg Kaibel in 1890 (Index Scriptorum).77 The index includes a list
of authors and works cited by Athenaeus and, like for the Index Scriptorum of
Meineke, the digital version of it has been created starting from the OCR output
of the printed volume.78 Also in this case, the OCR output has been parsed using
bash scripts and manually corrected in order to create an SQL database organized
in fields containing data collected and arranged by Kaibel for each author and
work. Like in the Index Scriptorum of Meineke, the OCR output embeds each
index entry in a TEI XML element <p>.79 The structure of the Index Scriptorum
of Kaibel has more data than the Index Scriptorum of Meineke, as it is shown
in the example concerning the entry of Demetrius of Scepsis (p. 604) in table
5.1.80 Athenaeus’ book numbers have been extracted and collected in a separate
field, Roman numerals have been converted into Arabic numerals, and Casaubon
citations have been converted into Kaibel citations using the Casaubon-Kaibel
Reference Converter.81
Greek and Latin expressions used by Kaibel in his index have been preserved
and entries have been structured to separate data in the following search fields
that are accessible through the Index Digger (fig. 5.13):82
– Name: author name (e.g., AESCHYLVS) and other index entries (e.g., ΤΕΛ-
ΧΙΝΙΑΚΗ ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑ);
– Ethnicon 1: place of origin of an author (e.g., Samius);
– Ethnicon 2: second place of origin of an author, when applicable (e.g.,
Babylonius);
77
Kaibel (1887–1890), vol. III 565–676.
78
The digital version of the Index Scriptorum is available at http://www.digitalathenaeus
.org/tools/KaibelIndexScriptorum/. The digitization of the edition of Kaibel has been
performed as part of the Open Greek and Latin project: see section 5.3.
79
The XML file is available at https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/athenaeus-dev/blob/
master/athenaeusKaibel_3.xml.
80
The page of the printed edition can be visualized at https://archive.org/details/athe
naeinavcrati03atheuoft/page/604/mode/1up. In the table there are three fields called
Ethnicon because there are cases where Kaibel prints more than one ethnicon, as in the
examples of Agathocles (Cyzicenus, Babylonius) and of Polemo (ὁεἴτε Σάμιος ἣΣικυώνιος
εἴτ’ Ἀθηναῖος ὀνομαζόμενος). The field Passage has been added because Kaibel prints the
reference passages of cited works, including fragment numbers. Finally, the field Asterisk
includes the asterisk (*) that sometimes is printed by Kaibel to signal dubious works and
passages. On these fields, see below.
81
See section 5.4.1.
On the complexities represented by the correspondences between
Casaubon sections and Kaibel paragraphs and on reference ranges, see section 5.5.1.

The following are examples of filtered search results with their correspond-
ing links to the Dynamic Graph of the Index Scriptorum of Kaibel: Work + Name
(HOMERVS); Name + Characterization (tragicus) (fig. 5.14). Also in this case re-
sults of the Dynamic Graph are visualized through Highcharts, can be printed, and
can be downloaded as a PNG image, JPEG image, PDF document and SVG vector
image. It is also possible to hide/show graphs by selecting/deselecting entries in
the list at the right of the chart, and visualize the number of occurrences in each
book of the Deipnosophists by hovering the mouse over the selected book.84
The Digital Athenaeus project provides scholars with a Web API with a JSON
output of Index Digger queries of the Index Scriptorum of Kaibel:85
api.php?what=<search string>&where=<search field>&exact=[yes:no]
Search fields of the Web API can be one of the following: name, ethnicon_1,
ethnicon_2, ethnicon_3, characterization, note, work, sub_work, note_work,
passage, book, casaubon_reference, kaibel_reference, note_reference. For ex-
ample, if we want to visualize citations of Istros the Callimachean as they are
collected and arranged by Kaibel in his index, we get the following result:86

As already explained for the index of Meineke at p. 344, also Kaibel makes an
effort to preserve the original Greek forms of work titles cited by Athenaeus.
These forms are represented in the database of the Digital Athenaeus, but there are
many occurrences where information about book numbers and internal divisions
of works has been extracted and stored in the database field Sub Work.90
90
For example, the expression ἐν τετάρτῳπερὶΠοιημάτων in the entry of DEMETRIVS ὁΒυ-
ζάντιος at p. 603 of the index has been split into ἐν τετάρτῳ(Sub Work) and περὶΠοιημάτων
(Work).

5.5.3 Kaibel – Dialogi Personae
The Teubner edition of the Deipnosophists of Georg Kaibel includes also an in-
dex entitled Dialogi Personae, where the editor collects references to the fol-
lowing twenty-four deipnosophistai and a group of anonymi who participate in
the dialogues described by Athenaeus:92 Aemilianus Maurus, Alcides Alexan-
drinus, Amoebeus, Arrianus, Athenaeus Naucratita, Cynulcus, Daphnus Eph-
esius, Democritus Nicomedensis, Dionysocles, Galenus Pergamenus, Larensis,
Leonidas Eleus, Magnus (fortasse Romanus genere), Masurius, Myrtilus Thessalus,
Palamedes ὁἘλεατικός, Philadelphus Ptolemaeensis, Plutarchus Alexandrinus,
Pontianus Nicomedensis, Rufinus Nicaeensis, Timocrati Athenaeus amicus, Ulpi-
anus Tyrius, Varus, Zoilus, and Anonymi.
The digital version of this index has been created with the same method used
for the indices scriptorum of Meineke and Kaibel starting from the OCR output of
the printed edition.93 Also in this case each entry is embedded in a TEI XML ele-
ment <p>.94 Each entry has been structured in order to generate an SQL database
that can be queried with the following search fields that are accessible through
the Index Digger:95
– Name 1: character name (e.g., VLPIANVS);
– Name 2: second character name, when applicable (e.g., Maurus);
– Ethnicon: place of origin of a character (e.g., Alexandrinus);
– Characterization: literary genre or profession of a character (e.g., medi-
cus);
– Note: Kaibel notes to name, ethnicon and/or characterization fields (e.g.,
graece Λαρήνσιος s. Λαρίνσιος …);
– Speech: references to when and how characters speak in the Deipnosophists
(e.g., loquitur);
– Athenaeus Book: book numbers of the Deipnosophists for each occurrence
(e.g., Book 12);
– Casaubon Reference: references to passages in the Deipnosophists where
characters are cited (e.g., 3.83c);
92
Kaibel (1887–1890), vol. III 561–564. Entries are here reproduced as in the index of Kaibel.
The deipnosophistai are twenty-two with the addition of the narrator Athenaeus and his
interlocutor Timocrates. On the structure of the Deipnosophists and its characters, see
Wilkins (2000). The edition of Kaibel prints also an Index Nominum (677–780) and an Index
Glossarum (781–810).

– Kaibel Reference: conversion of Casaubon references into Kaibel refer-
ences (e.g., 3.25);
– Note (Reference): Kaibel notes to Casaubon references (e.g., cf. praef. I
vi).
Additional output fields are the same of the other indices, ambiguous corre-
spondeces between Casaubon sections and Kaibel paragraphs can be voted and
disambiguated, and reference ranges are represented like in the indices scripto-
rum of Meineke and Kaibel (see pp. 324 ff.). The following are examples of
combined search results: Name 1 (VLPIANVS) AND Speech (loquitur); Name 1
(ANONYMI) AND Athenaeus Book (Book 14); Characterization (grammaticus)
OR Characterization (medicus) (fig. 5.15).
Figure 5.15. Kaibel, Dialogi Personae: grammaticus or medicus
Also the Dialogi Personae has a Dynamic Graph where results can be obtained by
filtering data using the following filter fields:96
– Name 1: character name (e.g., VLPIANVS);
– Name 2: second character name, when applicable (e.g., Maurus);
– Ethnicon: place of origin of a character (e.g., Alexandrinus);
– Characterization: literary genre or profession of a character (e.g., medi-
cus);
– Speech: references to when and how characters speak in the Deipnosophists
(e.g., loquitur).

1 + Ethnicon (Alexandrinus). Also in this case results of the Dynamic Graph are
visualized through Highcharts, can be printed, and can be downloaded as PNG
image, JPEG image, PDF document and SVG vector image. It is also possible
to hide/show graphs by selecting/deselecting entries in the list at the right of the
chart, and visualize the number of occurrences in each book of the Deipnosophists
by hovering the mouse over the selected book.97
The Digital Athenaeus project provides scholars with a Web API with a JSON
output of Index Digger queries of the Dialogi Personae of Kaibel:98
api.php?what=<search string>&where=<search field>&exact=[yes:no]
Search fields of the Web API can be one of the following: name_1, name_2, ethnicon,
characterization, note, speech, book, casaubon_reference, kaibel_reference,
note_reference. For example, if we want to know when Athenaeus refers to him-
self in the Deipnosophists, we get the following result:99

These expressions have of course to be understood in connection with each entry
of the Dialogi Personae of Kaibel, but nevertheless they reveal the complexity of
the references to the protagonists of the dialogues of the Deipnosophists and the
deep level of interpretation and annotation by Kaibel.

5.5.4 Olson – Index of Authors, Texts, and Persons
The last index which is available in the Digital Athenaeus project is the Index of
Authors, Texts, and Persons published by Douglas S. Olson in the last volume of his
Loed edition of the Deipnosophists.101 This index is not a selection of authors and
works cited by Athenaeus, but a list that includes also other persons mentioned in
the text, as explained by Olson himself.102 The reference to the online Thesaurus
Linguae Graecae (TLG) and the possibility of searching ancient Greek words in
text of the Deipnosophists is certainly true, but this assertion reveals a traditional
perspective with an interest in single occurrences. The same consideration is also
valid for names of authors and titles/descriptions of works.
The value of the indices scriptorum of August Meineke and Georg Kaibel is
due to the efforts made by these editors to extract and disambiguate informa-
tion pertaining to the citations preserved by Athenaeus.103 As we will see in the
101 Olson (2006–2012), vol. VIII 220–360. The digital version of the index is available at http:
//www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/OlsonIndex/.
102 Olson (2006–2012) 219: “This index supersedes those at the end of the first seven indi-
vidual volumes of the new Loeb Athenaeus, which were prepared by different research
assistants working under my supervision, and which accordingly vary somewhat in for-
mat, coverage, citation style, and the like. Almost every personal name in the index is
followed by a brief identifier. Individuals of primarily historical rather than literary in-
terest are further identified, where possible, by reference to one or more of the relevant
standard prosopographies. In the case of obscure homonyms, I have generally chosen to
split rather than to combine entries, although absolute consistency in this matter — as in
many others — is impossible. Fragmentary authors and texts are identified by the modern
editor or editors on whose numbering I have relied; for clarity’s sake, I have attempted
to follow the individual preferences of such editors in the use of the designations fr., F,
and the like. Occasional parentheses around numbers indicate that while the editor of the
standard edition of the author or work in question regards this as a legitimate fragment
or testimonium, I do not. Lowercase Roman numerals at the beginning of entries refer to
page numbers in the introduction in Volume 1 (LCL 204). Gulick included a separate index
of Greek words in the final volume of his Loeb. The ongoing development of digital search
tools has made a printed — and thus inevitably selective — Greek index less necessary or
useful than one might have been in his day. I have accordingly chosen instead to catalog
material less easily accessible via a simple TLG search or the like.” Olson has published also
an Index of Places and People (ibid. 361–380: “This index includes commodities, flora and
fauna, dialects, measures, and the like associated with individual cities, regions, or peoples
named in the text. It does not include geographical terms used primarily as identifiers for
individuals. Thus, for example, Philip of Macedon is not included here under ‘Macedon.’
Nor does this index include geographical or ethnic terms that are merely part of the titles
of literary works (e.g., Aristophanes’ Lemnian Women and Crates’ Attic Dialect).”)
103 Meineke and Kaibel produced also an Index Rerum (in Latin), an Index Nominum (in ancient
Greek), and an Index Glossarum (in ancient Greek) in their editions: see pp. 322, 369, 
and 370. Charles Gulick, who is referred to by Olson, published a Greek Index and an 
English Index: see Gulick (1951–1957), vol. VII 277–327 and 329–345. Cf. also ibid. x: “In 
the Indixes, prepared with the devoted aid of my wife, effort has been made to show as 
completely as possible the vast scope and encyclopaedic nature of Athenaeus’ work.”

378
5 Digital Athenaeus
following sections and in particular in the discussion about Named Entity Recog-
nition, this is the reason why the work of Meineke and Kaibel is more useful than
the index of Olson in order to provide data for generating a catalog of ancient
Greek authors and works in the original language.104
The index of Olson is now readable as part of the Digital Loeb Classical Li-
brary, which is accessible with a subscription.105 This resource allows users to
consult the index on the screen, but is not dynamic and doesn’t connect index
entries with the text of the Deipnosophists and other tools. The Digital Athenaeus
project offers an expanded and dynamic version of the index of Olson that has
been generated from the HTML version of it. The output has been structured
in an SQL database that can be queried with the following search fields that are
accessible through the Index Digger:106
– Name: author/person/god name (e.g., Achaeus of Eretria);
– Identifier: literary genre, profession, or characterization of authors and
persons (e.g., philosopher);
– Sub Identifier: further characterization of authors, persons, and gods
(e.g., as Mother of the Gods);
– Prosopographical Reference: references to prosopographies (e.g., PAA);107
– Prosopographical Reference ID: prosopography identifiers for authors
and persons (e.g., 101398);
– Work: abbreviation of work titles (e.g., PV);
– Edition: references to modern editions and collections (e.g., FGrH);108
– Edition ID: edition and collection identifiers for authors and work passages
(e.g., 488);
– Passage: work passages cited and quoted in the Deipnosophists (e.g., T 1);
– Athenaeus Book: book numbers of the Deipnosophists for each occurrence
(e.g., Book 7);
– Casaubon Reference: references to passages in the Deipnosophists where
authors, persons, and texts are cited (e.g., 1.17d);
– Kaibel Reference: conversion of Casaubon references into Kaibel refer-
ences (e.g., 1.30).
Additional output fields are the same of the other indices, ambiguous correspon-
deces between Casaubon sections and Kaibel paragraphs can be voted and dis-
ambiguated, and reference ranges are represented like in the indices scriptorum
104 Also the indices of “names”, “things”, and “glossae” produced by Meineke and Kaibel (see n.
103) are useful as disambiguated lists of entries and lemmata than can be used to perform
NLP analyses of the text of the Deipnosophists.

Figure 5.17. Dynamic Graph (Olson, Index of Authors, Texts, and Persons): FGrH
Also the Index of Authors, Texts, and Persons has a Dynamic Graph where results
can be obtained by filtering data using the following filter fields:110
– Name: author/person/god name (e.g., Achaeus of Eretria);
– Identifier: literary genre, profession, or characterization of authors and
persons (e.g., philosopher);
– Sub Identifier: further characterization of authors, persons, and gods
(e.g., as Mother of the Gods);
– Prosopographical Reference: references to prosopographies (e.g., PAA);
– Prosopographical Reference ID: prosopography identifiers for authors
and persons (e.g., 101398);
– Work: abbreviation of work titles (e.g., PV);
109 See pp. 324 ff. The Index Digger of the index of Olson provides a further output field, which
is called Note Reference and visualizes Olson notes to Casaubon references (constituted
only by the forms note, round brackets to refer to the use of () by Olson to embed references,
and with note).

– Edition: references to modern editions and collections (e.g., FGrH);
– Edition ID: edition and collection identifiers for authors and work passages
(e.g., 488);
– Passage: work passages cited and quoted in the Deipnosophists (e.g., 1.225).
The following are examples of filtered search results with their corresponding
links to the Dynamic Graph: Name + Edition (FGrH); Name + Edition (FGrH) – lim-
ited to the 10 first results (fig. 5.17); Name + Identifier (goddess). Also in this case
results of the Dynamic Graph are visualized through Highcharts, can be printed,
and can be downloaded as PNG image, JPEG image, PDF document and SVG vec-
tor image. It is also possible to hide/show graphs by selecting/deselecting entries
in the list at the right of the chart, and visualize the number of occurrences in each
book of the Deipnosophists by hovering the mouse over the selected book.111 The
Digital Athenaeus project provides scholars with a Web API with a JSON output
of Index Digger queries of the Index of Authors, Texts, and Persons of Olson:112
api.php?what=<search string>&where=<search field>&exact=[yes:no]
Search fields of the Web API can be one of the following: name, identifier,
sub_identifier, prosopographical_reference, prosopographical_reference_id,
work, edition, edition_id, passage, book, casaubon_reference, kaibel_reference.
For example, if we want to know when and how Athenaeus refers to Cleidemus
of Athens in the Deipnosophists, we get the following result:113

of authors. Also, entries are in English and they generate a bigger distance than
the Latin forms of Meineke and Kaibel for the alignment with the Greek text of
the Deipnosophists.115 The two following sections show how all these indices of
the Digital Athenaeus project can be compared and used to map their entries on
to the text of the Naucratites.
5.5.5 Book Stream
The Book Stream is a tool that performs and visualizes the automatic alignment
of the four indices of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus described in the previ-
ous sections:116 Index Scriptorum by August Meineke; Index Scriptorum by Georg
Kaibel; Dialogi Personae by Georg Kaibel; Index of Authors, Texts, and Persons by
S. Douglas Olson. The tool is arranged by books and Kaibel paragraphs and each
paragraph is linked to Index to Text, which is an experimental tool based on the
Levenshtein Distance for the automatic alignment of index entries with their cor-
responding forms in the Greek text of the Deipnosophists.117 Figure 5.18 shows
the alignment of the entries of the four indices that correspond to Deipn. 1.1 on
the basis of Kaibel paragraphs.118 The menu on the left of the web page allows

to select a Kaibel paragraph and each entry of the corresponding paragraph is
linked to the entry in the Index Digger of the selected index. The column in the

to the corresponding text in Index to Text.119

5.5.6 Index to Text
Index to Text is a tool that automatically aligns each entry of the four indices of
Athenaeus with the Greek text of the Deipnosophists.120 The alignment is per-
formed with a PHP implementation of the Levenshtein Distance that measures
the distance between each element of each index entry and each word of the
Greek paragraph corresponding to the Kaibel reference of the relevant entries.
The alignment is based on the lowest of the following distances:121 1) between
each index entry and all Greek words, 2) between each index entry and all translit-
erated Greek words, 3) between each index entry and all Greek words romanized
into Latin (i.e., c instead of k, us instead of os, and u instead of ou), 4) between
each index entry and all Greek transliterated words where the letter k is substi-
tuted with the letter c, 5) between each entry and both the transliterated and the
119 For example, the paragraph of fig. 5.18 is linked to http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools
/KaibelText/indexTOtext.php?passage=1.1&T=2.
120 The Greek text is based on the edition of Georg Kaibel: see section 5.3.1.
121 The reason of these distances is due to the fact that most of the entries are in Latin and in
English (in the case of Olson) and can’t be directly aligned with the Greek text.

romanized lemma of all Greek words (where the letter k is substituted with the
letter c).122 Every word of the Greek text with a distance lower than the thresh-
old is highlighted with the same color of the aligned index entry.123 Words that
are aligned with more than one index entry (because there are four indices con-
taining more or less the same entries) are highlighted with all the colors of the
higlighted index entries.
The resource is based on the alignment of Kaibel references that have been
automatically generated by the conversion of Casaubon references included in
the printed versions of the indices. For example, if we read Deipn. 7.124–125
(= 323f–325a), we see that in these two paragraphs Athenaeus cites the follow-
ing forms corresponding to the names of sixteen authors:124 7.124 (Ἐπίχαρμος,
Σπεύσιππον, Ἱππώνακτος, Ἐρασίστρατός, Γλαῦκος δ᾽ὁΛοκρὸς, Ἀρχέστρατός,
Ἀριστοφάνης, Θεόπομπος, Ἄλεξις); 7.125 (Ἀριστοτέλης, Ἐπίχαρμος, Σώφρων, Δι-
οκλῆς, Σπεύσιππος, Τρύφων, Σώφρων).
Figure 5.19. Digital Athenaeus: Index to Text (Ath., Deipn. 7.124)
If we select these two paragraphs in Index to Text, we can see interesting results.
As far as 7.124 is concerned (fig. 5.19),125 the indices of Meineke and Olson list
nine entries corresponding to the nine authors cited in this paragraph. The index
of Kaibel doesn’t include the name of Epicharmus, because in the printed edition
122 Every entry and every Greek word is put in lower case at the beginning of the whole
process.
123 The Levenshtein Distance is one of the distances included in PHP functions and is defined
as the minimal number of characters you have to replace, insert, or delete to transform a
string into another one. For my alignment, I have chosen to consider two strings the same
if the Levenshtein Distance is lower than 2.
124 See p. 306 on the marginalia to these paragraphs in the manuscript Marc. Gr. 447.

the reference to 323f is in a note to 318e, where a very similar quotation of frag-
ment 18 of Epicharmus is cited by Athenaeus.126 No entries are listed under the
Dialogi Personae of Kaibel because there are no corresponding forms in the Greek
text. Except for the form Ἱππώνακτος, all the other eight forms in the text of
7.124 are aligned with the index entries of Olson, Kaibel, and Meineke. Below the
alignment, the web page of Indext to Text shows the distances between the en-
tries and the forms of the Greek text with their corresponding URNs that embed
a link to the text of the Deipnosophists (fig. 5.20).127 The same page shows also
a distinction between single references and multiple references under each index.
This is due to the fact that Index to Text is based on URNs generated from Kaibel
citations that are the result of the their conversion from Casaubon citations with
the Casaubon-Kaibel Reference Converter.
As it was explained at p. 324, the different length of Casaubon sections and
Kaibel paragraphs generates ambiguities in the conversion. In our example, the
entries of Olson about “Alexis of Thurii”, “Epicharmus of Syracuse”, and “Speusip-
pus of Athens” are labelled as multiple references because the automatic conver-
sion of their Casaubon references generates multiple Kaibel paragraphs.128 This is
also the reason why Index to Text sometimes shows entries that don’t correspond
to Greek forms in the aligned paragraph of the Deipnosophists. In our example,
the entry ARISTOTELES of the Index Scriptorum of Kaibel doesn’t correspond to
a name of 7.124, but to the Greek form Ἀριστοτέλης cited in 7.123.129
As far as 7.125 is concerned (fig. 5.21),130 the indices of Kaibel and Olson list
six entries corresponding to the six authors cited in this paragraph. The index of
Meineke doesn’t include an entry for Speusippus because this passage is missing
in the printed edition of the index. Every form of author names of 7.125 is aligned
with the index entries of Olson, Kaibel, and Meineke. Also in this case ambiguities
are due to ambiguities of references. By clicking on each entry in the web page
of Index to Text, it is possible to visualize the correspondences between Casaubon
and Kaibel citations for each URN through a resource that is an enhanced Index
Digger: http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/OlsonIndex/superdigger.php.
126 Ath., Deipn. 318e: Ἐπίχαρμος δ᾽ἐν Ἥβας γάμῳ· πώλυποί τε σηπίαι τε καὶποταναὶ
τευθίδες χἀδυσώδης βολβιτὶς γραῖαί τ᾽ἐριθακώδεες.
127 http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/KaibelText/indexTOtext.php?passage=7.124&T=2
128 For example, Deipn. 324c, which is the reference to Alexis of Thurii in the index of Olson,
corresponds to Kaibel 7.124 and 7.125 according to the automatic conversion. On the other
side, Deipn. 324b, which is the reference to Archestratus of Gela in the index of Olson,
corresponds to Kaibel 7.124 and this is the reason why this reference is labelled as single
reference.
129 The form Ἀριστοτέλης is also present in 7.125, but in this case the index entry of Kaibel is
unambiguously aligned with it: http://www.digitalathenaeus.org/tools/KaibelText/inde

This resource uses the Levenshtein Distance to solve ambiguities of index en-
tries that are generated by the automatic conversion of Casaubon references into
Kaibel references. Every index entry is aligned with the passage corresponding
to its Kaibel reference and the corresponding URNs are printed if the alignment
is detected. This resource is an experimental tool to try to automatically disam-
biguate Kaibel paragraphs instead of manually voting them.131
5.6 Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of information extraction that aims at
finding mentions of named entities in the text and classify their types into cat-
egories corresponding to proper names and quantities of interest, such as peo-
ple, places, organizations, time expressions, monetary amounts, percentages, etc.
NER is a relatively mature technology in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
its goal is to extract semantic content from texts by acquiring structured data from
unstructured information.132 NER is now generating a great interest to scholars
working in the digital humanities, as it is demonstrated by the implementation
of web-based platforms for the annotation of historical documents like Perseids
and Recogito.133 Moreover, infrastructure software projects like ANNIS and IN-
CEpTION — that are not associated with any single annotation project — are also
used in the digital humanities and for historical languages.134
As far as Classical languages are concerned, experiments have been done
for Latin and NER is in the agenda of The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK).135
Recogito provides automatic NER tagging for historical documents using Stan-
ford CoreNLP, but is still limited to English, French, German and Spanish with
beta support for Latin NER.136 For authority lists of named entities in ancient
Greek, we dispose of preliminary and partial data in the online Lexicon of Greek
Personal Names (LGPN), in the gazetteer Pleiades, in the beta version of Trismegis-
tos People, and in the project Standards for Networking Ancient Prosopographies

(SNAP:DRGN).137 These projects demonstrate that NER for historical data is chal-
lenging due to its nature, but also that plays a key role in document comprehen-
sion processes and that merits special attention in the context of both Classical
Philology and NLP. Moreover, even if linguistic annotations of ancient Greek and
Latin texts are growing,138 high quality annotations of NEs in these languages are
still missing.
The Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis is a rich collection of proper
names pertaining to a wide variety of typologies like personal names, peoples,
places, groups, languages, festivals, astronomical and meteorological phenomena,
chronological data and currencies.139 Moreover, Athenaeus’ work is a huge mine
of references to more than 900 authors of Classical literature and their writings,
as demonstrated by the data extracted from the indices that have been described
in the previous pages. This is the reason why the Digital Athenaeus project has
been experimenting with NER in order to extract from the Deipnosophists names
of ancient authors and titles and descriptions of ancient works for starting the
creation of a text-based catalog of ancient Greek literature.140 What we miss is a
structured knowledge resource about ancient Greek authors and works with word
forms in the original language, corresponding lemmata, contextual annotations,
coreferences and relations accompanied by a deep analysis of the language of
bibliographic citations in textual sources.
In order to obtain this result, the text of the Deipnosophists (ed. Kaibel) has
been tokenized, capitalized words have been extracted, and non-relevant enti-
ties have been removed.141 This method works because modern editions of an-
cient Greek sources generally capitalize words corresponding to proper names
and words after a full stop.
In the edition of the Deipnosophists by Kaibel, only the first word of the
first paragraph of each book has been capitalized for a total of fifteen occur-
rences, while beginning words of other paragraphs are typed in lower case un-
less they are proper names. Sometimes Kaibel prints content-related words en-

Leipzig: Berti (2019d). See also Berti (2021). Data has been also presented and discussed
at a conference organized in Trier in November 2020 (Fragmente einer fragmentierten Welt:
Gespräche zur Problematisierung eines traditionellen Begriffes in der modernen klassisch-
philologischen Forschung), whose proceedings are going to be published in the De Gruyter
Transmissions series, and at the Digital Classicist Seminar Berlin in December 2020. Infor-
mation presented in these pages derive from these publications and discussions.

tirely in capital letters and they have been identified and removed.142 The text of
the Deipnosophists includes 264,750 tokens distributed in 15 books for a total of
1,328 paragraphs and 21,460 sentences. Ca. 23,000 named entities have been ex-
tracted. These entities have been lemmatized to query them in external resources
for a first disambiguation.143 The lemmatization has been performed by querying
Morpheus, Logeion, the Lemmatized Ancient Greek XML, and the online Thesaurus
Linguae Graecae (TLG).

As of 2021, the result is the extraction of 22,924 inflected forms of single NEs cor-
responding to 8,435 unique forms and 4,470 lemmata. Lemmata have been used
to query external authority lists to obtain a first provisional set of disambiguated
annotations. Annotations of personal and geographical names have been au-
tomatically generated by querying lemmata in the online Lexicon of Greek Per-
sonalNames (LGPN) (ca. 63% of all NEs) and in the Pleiades gazetteer (ca. 17%
of all NEs).144 For the annotation, tags used in computational linguistics have
been adopted for labeling generic named entitity types: LOC, LOCderiv, ORG,
ORGderiv, OTH, PER, PERderiv (table 5.2).145 Missing lemmata have been man-
ually added providing a rich set of new lemmatized named entities that are still
missing in the above mentioned resources. Data is stored in an SQL database,
whose entries can be publicly interrogated in the Named Entities Digger and in

5.6.1 Named Entities Digger
The Named Entities Digger is a tool for digging single Named Entities (NE) into
the Greek text of the Deipnosophists.147 The tool is complementary to the Named
Entities Concordance,148 is experimental, based on semi-automatic methods and
linked to external resources. Results still need further correction, disambiguation,
NE relation and coreference resolution.149 The tool is also complementary to the
Book Stream and to Index to Text, and is linked to the CTS URN Retriever.150 The
following search fields allow to search inflected forms and lemmata by typing
Ancient Greek in Unicode or by using ASCII transliteration:
– Word form: inflected forms (with transliteration) of detected NEs as they
appear in the Deipnosophists (e.g., Αἰσχύλου [Aischylou])
– Lemma: lemmata (with transliteration) of inflected forms of detected NEs of
the Deipnosophists (e.g., Ἀμφικτύων [Amphiktyon]).

matically detect only inflected forms (lemmata can be accessed through inflected
forms).153
The Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (LGPN) and the gazetteer Pleiades dis-
ambiguate lemmata of personal and place names. In the LGPN, lemmata of per-
sonal names can be detected with the ancient Greek form, while places can be
detected only in the transliteration.154 In Pleiades, ancient Greek forms of places
can be detected and obtained, if available.155 The Index of Ancient Greek Lexica is
a resource developed by the DC3 (Duke Collaboratory for Classics Computing)
that allows to detect entries in different lexica of ancient Greek.156 VIAF is the
Virtual International Authority File that “matches and links widely-used authority
files and makes that information available on the Web.”157 For our purposes, VIAF
allows to search lemmata in ancient Greek.158 Gulick refers to an EpiDoc XML
file of the edition of the Deipnosophists by Charles Gulick that includes markup
of named entities.159 The following ten entities are marked up within the TEI
element <name> and the attribute @type:160 1) constellation (2), 2) ethnic (1,241),
153 On the morphological analysis of ancient Greek in the TLG, see http://stephanus.tlg.uci.

DFHG project with Logeion, see p. 167. Links to the TLG can be provided depending on an
individual or an institutional subscription (http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/subscriptions.php).
In this case I have chosen the individual subscription and, if users are logged in with an
institutional subscription, the resource can’t be accessed.
154 For example, http://clas-lgpn2.classics.ox.ac.uk/name/Θησεύς and http://clas-lgpn2
.classics.ox.ac.uk/place/Abydos. In terms of automatic detection, there are issues of
character encoding. For example, the personal name Ἴστρος is not detectable because in
the LGPN the beginning iota with smooth breathing and acute accent is represented as
a Unicode composing character and not as a precomposed character: cf. Tauber (2019).
This is the reason why the LGPN gives as a result only the place name “Istros”: http:
//clas-lgpn2.classics.ox.ac.uk/place/Istros.

Thanks to the extraction of marked up entities from the Perseus XML file, the
Named Entities Digger is able to add information deriving from the attribute @type
about inflected forms of NEs in the Deipnosophists.162
Internal resources connected to the Named Entities Digger allow scholars
to visualize each named entity in the context of the Deipnosophists through the
161 The lemma is in Beta Code with morphological information. Due to lack of documentation,
it is not possible to get information and meaning of ciphers in the attribute @key.

Search function163 and to obtain a CTS URN of each occurrence through the CTS
URN Retriever.164 Named Entity classes (LOC, LOCderiv, ORG, ORGderiv, OTH,
PER, PERderiv) are a first form of disambiguation according to standards of com-
putational linguistics that will be further specified with subclasses.165 Finally,
the connection with the indices of the Digital Athenaeus allows to see if detected
named entities are present in the indices of Meineke, Kaibel, and Olson and how
they have been annotated by these scholars.
5.6.2 Named Entities Concordance
The Named Entities Concordance is a tool for finding concordances of single
Named Entities (NE) in the Greek text of the Deipnosophists (ed. Kaibel).166 The
tool is complementary to the Named Entities Digger.167 The following search fields
allow to search inflected forms and lemmata by typing ancient Greek in Unicode
or by using ASCII transliteration:
– Word form: inflected forms (with transliteration) of detected NEs as they ap-
pear in the Deipnosophists (e.g., Πλάτωνος [Platonos] and Φιλόχορος [Philo-
choros]) (figg. 5.23 and 5.24);168
– Lemma: lemmata (with transliteration) of inflected forms of detected NEs of
the Deipnosophists (e.g., Ἀριστοφάνης [Aristophanes]) (fig. 5.25).169
Output fields show results of the requested inflected form or lemma and the out-
put visualizes each occurrence in the immediate context, where the requested
entity is red and other NEs in the immediate context are blue-green and link-
able (figg. 5.23, 5.25, and 5.24):
– Lemma:
– automatic detection of lemmata in Logeion.
– Inflected form:
– search in Kaibel: search every occurrence of detected NEs in the Greek
text of the Deipnosophists (ed. Kaibel);

Figure 5.23. Named Entities Concordance: Πλάτωνος [Platonos]
This dynamic concordance visualizes the function of each named entity in the
context and focuses on the language of bibliographic references, going beyond the
limits of a traditional sequential reading approach. For example, the extraction
of the occurrences of the name Ἀριστοφάνης in the Deipnosophists immediately
reveals the citations of three homonymous authors: the comic poet (tlg0019), the
historian from Boeotia (tlg1196), and the Byzantine grammarian (tlg0644). Ci-
tations in their context show when and how these authors are referred to and
if they are accompanied by expressions related to their literary activity (γραμ-
ματικός, κωμικός, etc.) and their works. For example, the form Πλοῦτος in the
Deipnosophists is not only the title of a comedy by Aristophanes (that Athenaeus
distinguishes between a first and a second edition), but also the title of works by
Epicharmus (tlg0521) and Nicostratus (tlg0484).170

5.6.3 Named Entities Annotation
Pre-annotated data described in section 5.6 has been imported into INCEpTION,
which is a web-based platform for semantic text annotation.171 The INCEpTION
platform reuses parts of WebAnno, which is a text annotation tool that was orig-
inally developed for the CLARIN community but that is now mainly maintained
as part of the INCEpTION project.172 INCEpTION combines WebAnno with new
functionalities such as the knowledge management, search, and more. Both tools
support a wide range of text annotation tasks including NE annotation. More-
over, INCEpTION supports interactive and semantic annotation, as for example
concept linking, fact linking, and knowledge base population.173
In the Digital Athenaeus project, INCEpTION is currently used to visualize,
correct, and nest annotations of single ancient Greek NEs that have been semi-
automatically extracted with the method described in section 5.6. Data has been
imported into INCEpTION as TSV files generated according to the WebAnno TSV
3.2 file format.174 Each file includes the text of single paragraphs of the Deip-
nosophists with sentences split in separate lines.175 Figure 5.26 shows how pre-
annotated data is stored in a TSV file, where each sentence and each token has
a number and where entities are annotated with a NamedEntity layer and a Lemma
layer. Each entity is also provided with a CTS URN. Figure 5.27 shows how this
data is visualized in INCEpTION in separate numbered lines, where single entities
have colored labels corresponding to the two layers NamedEntity and Lemma.
A layer called Catalog has been created in INCEpTION to annotate NEs
that correspond to names of ancient authors and to descriptions/titles of ancient
works, in order to disambiguate these entities and produce a text-based catalog
of Greek literature with annotations of ancient Greek inflected forms and their
corresponding lemmata. Figure 5.28 shows the Catalog layer, whose values cor-
respond to CTS URNs that uniquely identify authors and works.176
Individual entities have been linked together in spans corresponding to real
entities, as for example Ἀρχέστρατος ὁΣυρακούσιος ἣΓελῷος (Archestratus from
171 See https://inception-project.github.io/ and Klie/Bugert et al. (2018). On the annotation of
the Deipnosophists in INCEpTION, see https://inception-project.github.io/use-cases/digita

Syracuse or Gela), who is citable as urn:cts:greekLit:tlg1175. In the same line,
different forms of the title of Archestratus’ work are identified with a CTS URN
that also includes the reference to the author through the TLG four-digit number
tlg1175: urn:cts:greekLit:tlg1175.ath001.177
In the annotations, the TLG three-digit numbers used for works have been
experimentally substituted with the string ath### because TLG numbers are as-
sociated with the editions of the texts published in the corpus of the TLG. I use
the string ath### to express the fact that I’m annotating the text of Athenaeus
and, in theory, the editions used by him when composing the Deipnosophists.178
INCEpTION allows also to ingest data from the Wikidata knowledge base, which
acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects
including Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others. In this
case, the Wikidata item Q210507 identifies Archestratus and its label is included
in the catalog layer.179
177 The four forms are: Γαστρονομία, Ἡδυπάθεια, Δειπνολογία, and Ὀψοποιΐα. On the titles
of the work of Archestratus, see p. 109 n. 26.
178 Cf. Berti/Blackwell et al. (2016). This method has a computational and philological purpose,
but it’s certainly not a way to bypass the well known questions concerning the sources used
by Athenaeus. On TLG three-digit numbers, see p. 19 n. 55.

As part of a DFG-funded project, work is currently focused on standardize
lemmata, check annotations, correct inconsistencies, include complete NEs dis-
ambiguation and linking, and perform coreference resolution with a focus on en-
tities related to ancient Greek authors and works.180 Lemmatized and annotated
entities include names of authors (e.g., Θουκυδίδης and Ἀντισθένης ὁΣωκρατι-
κός) and words belonging to ancient titles or to descriptions of ancient works
(e.g., ἐν τῷπερὶἈττικῶν Ὀνομάτων ἢΓλωσσῶν and Πλούτῳδευτέρῳ). These
forms that have been annotated and revised with generic tags need to be further
specified according to their function in the Deipnosophists. For example, Θουκυ-
δίδης in the text of Athenaeus is not only a personal name [PER], but also the
name of an ancient author; Ἡρακλῆς is not only the name of a god [PER], but also
the title of different works.
In order to follow current practices in Linked Open Data (LOD), semantic
subtypes for domain-specific named entities will be defined according to the Func-
tional Requirements for Bibliographic Records entity-relationship model (FRBR),
which is also a reference standard of the Perseus Catalog and of the CITE Archi-
tecture.181 Semantic subtypes will cover the variety of words used by Athenaeus
to refer to authors, works, and editions. Tags and semantic subtypes will be part
of a tagset that will be uploaded into INCEpTION to visualize and correct data.
Considering the characteristics of bibliographic references in the Deip-
nosophists, this part of the work will allow to produce and export a tagset that
can be used to annotate bibliographic entities in other works of ancient Greek lit-
erature. The project will then disambiguate and extract bibliographic references
from revised entities. Single entities will be linked together in spans correspond-
ing to real entities, such as author names (e.g., Ἴστρος ὁΚαλλιμάχειος) and work
titles (e.g., Λακεδαιμονίων Πολιτείᾳ). Tags will be further specified according to
the BIO and BILOU annotation formats for multi-token entities.182
These tags will be nested with semantic subtypes. Disambiguation and ex-
traction will also capture parts of real entities not yet annotated, as for exam-
ple the lower-case title συμπόσιον in the expression τὸδὲΠλάτωνος συμπόσιον.
Transliterated lemmata will be aligned with entries of the indices scriptorum of
the Digital Athenaeus project and with entries extracted from the TLG Canon and
from the Perseus Catalog. Missing entities will be manually added. Given that
we don’t have bibliographic authority lists in ancient Greek, but only catalogs in
Latin or in modern languages, the work for disambiguating and extracting named
entities will be performed semi-automatically. The lemmatization will allow to
query lemmata of named entities in external resources to generate provisional

results. Ancient Greek lemmata will be queried in Logeion, VIAF, DBPedia and
Wikidata, in order to find author names of ancient Greek writers that will be fur-
ther disambiguated with a contextual analysis in the text of the Deipnosophists
to distinguish, for example, Πλάτων the philosopher and Πλάτων the comic poet.
These resources are very useful, because they provide a structured knowledge re-
source and are importing author names in ancient Greek, that are usually missing
in traditional catalogs and indices where these names are expressed in Latin or
in other modern languages.
Provisionally annotated data will be uploaded into INCEpTION for visual-
ization, query, correction, active learning and concept linking. INCEpTION will
also help perform coreference resolution for solving coreferences in order to iden-
tify and relate different references to the same entity like names, descriptions, and
pronouns. For example, Ἴστρος and Ἴστρος ὁΚαλλιμάχειος in the Deipnosophists
refer to same entity “Ister Cyrenaeus”.183 Another example is the adjective γραμ-
ματικός to be referred to Ἀριστοφάνης in order to disambiguate the grammarian
from other homonymous authors cited by Athenaeus.184 This work will produce
a knowledge base in INCEpTION for linking entity mentions to a structured vo-
cabulary for ancient Greek authors and works that can be used to annotate other
texts. As mentioned before, remote knowledge bases like DBPedia and Wikidata
will be also used in INCEpTION to link annotations with external resources.185

For exam-

which
means that this is the first occurrence of the word Ἑλλάνικον in this paragraph
of Athenaeus’ work. This instance of the name Hellanicus will be also assigned
urn:cite:perseus:author.701, which is the identifier of the author Hellanicus of
Lesbos in the Perseus Catalog.186

Ambiguities and manuscript variants will be documented, and authors and
works still missing in the TLG and in the Perseus Catalog will be assigned new
identifiers, as for example the grammarian Agallis of Corcyra cited in Deipn. 1.25.
This phase of the project will find semantic relations among annotated real enti-
ties, which means relating entities of bibliographic references in the text of the
Deipnosophists, as for example relating author name, book number, and title in
the expression Ξενοφῶν ἐν δευτέρῳἈναβάσεως in Deipn. 2.85.
The language of bibliographic references in the Deipnosophists is precise and
structured, and it is possible to identify regular patterns based on the morphology
and on the context of words of named entities including verba dicendi, like for
example γράφει, ἔφη, ἱστορεῖ, μέμνηται, μνημονεύει, φησίν, etc. Regular patterns
and contextual clues identified in this phase will be used to annotate bibliographic
relations in other texts.189
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging of the Deipnosophists is already available in
the Lemmatized Ancient Greek XML corpus and this data will be used during this
phase of the project. Finally, INCEpTION provides a “search functionality” that
allows to perform different queries for extracting and annotating relations.190 The
“fact extraction functionality” of INCEpTION will be also used to annotate rela-
tions and populate the knowledge base.191 Data produced will be imported into
ANNIS for visualization and retrieval. ANNIS is a DFG-funded project that offers
a web browser-based search and visualization architecture for complex multi-
layer linguistic corpora with diverse types of annotation.192 ANNIS is also used
for historical languages as in the project Coptic SCRIPTORIUM.193 ANNIS will be
used in the Digital Athenaeus project for visualizing and querying named entity
annotations.

Conclusion
Two main models emerge from this book: 1) the digitization of printed editions
of textual fragments and 2) the annotation of textual elements about fragmentary
authors and works. Both models have been presented with the description of the
Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum and the Digital Athenaeus projects.
Current standards and tools allow the realization of these models, but the agenda
still includes a request for more data in order to produce stable results. I can
summarize this request by individuating three main needs for dealing with frag-
mentary authors and works.
Optical Character Recognition technologies are already providing signifi-
cant results, but we need further advancements for converting and structuring
complex critical editions of Classical sources. The conversion into machine read-
able texts of these editions is fundamental to preserve ancient Greek and Latin
sources and the philological editorial work that has been produced on them.
More editions of sources that preserve information about fragmentary au-
thors and works have to be digitized in order to individuate, select, extract and
interpret data in the original language and expand it. This data is essential to en-
rich and create new dictionaries and authority lists with inflected forms, lemmata,
and named entities.
The work of scholars should focus on the production of semi-automatic an-
notations of textual elements about fragmentary authors and works in order to
go beyond the traditional concept of fragmenta and represent text reuses in their
context of transmission. These annotations will help create for the first time a
text-based catalog of fragmentary authors and works with occurrences and vari-
ants in the ancient language.
Greek and Latin fragmentary literature is part of a bigger historical textual
heritage and many other needs could be added to this short list, as demonstrated
by countless publications on the Digital Humanities. The goal of this monograph
and its related data is to concretely show some of these requests and opportuni-
ties, pointing also to the need for data assessment and evaluation, which have still
to be satisfactorily discussed to enhance academic careers and teaching programs.

This book describes a new model for digital editions of his­
torical fragmentary texts, i.e. texts that have been lost in 
their original form and survive only through citations and 
reuses in later works. This book describes the current state 
of digital libraries of fragmentary texts and presents two 
new related projects: the “Digital Fragmenta Historicorum 
Graecorum” project, which is the digital and expanded ver­
sion of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG), and 
the “Digital Athenaeus” project, which provides an inven­
tory of authors and works cited in the Deipnosophists of 
Athenaeus of Naucratis with a data model for their identifi­
cation and analysis.
