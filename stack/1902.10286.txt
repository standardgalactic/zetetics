Abstract
Unobserved confounding is a central barrier
to drawing causal inferences from observa-
tional data.
Several authors have recently
proposed that this barrier can be overcome
in the case where one attempts to infer the
eﬀects of several variables simultaneously. In
this paper, we present two simple, analytical
counterexamples that challenge the general
claims that are central to these approaches.
In addition, we show that nonparametric
identiﬁcation is impossible in this setting.
We discuss practical implications, and sug-
gest alternatives to the methods that have
been proposed so far in this line of work: us-
ing proxy variables and shifting focus to sen-
sitivity analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Estimating causal eﬀects in the presence of unobserved
confounding is one of the fundamental challenges of ca-
sual inference from observational data, and is known
to be infeasible in general (Pearl, 2009). This is be-
cause, in the presence of unobserved confounding, the
observed data distribution is compatible with many
potentially contradictory causal explanations, leaving
the investigator with no way to distinguish between
them on the basis of data. When this is the case, we
say that the causal quantity of interest, or estimand, is
not identiﬁed. Conversely, when the causal estimand
can be written entirely in terms of observable proba-
bility distributions, we say the query is identiﬁed.
A recent string of work has suggested that progress
can be made with unobserved confounding in the spe-
cial case where one is estimating the eﬀects of mul-

tiple interventions (causes) simultaneously, and these
causes are conditionally independent in the observa-
tional data given the latent confounder (Wang and
Blei, 2018; Tran and Blei, 2017; Ranganath and Per-
otte, 2018).
The structure of this solution is com-
pelling because it admits model checking, is compat-
ible with modern machine learning methods, models
real-world settings where the space of potential inter-
ventions is high-dimensional, and leverages this dimen-
sionality to extract causal conclusions. Unfortunately,
this work does not establish general suﬃcient condi-
tions for identiﬁcation.
In this paper, we explore some of these gaps, making
use of two simple counterexamples. We focus on the
central question of how much information about the
unobserved confounder can be recovered from the ob-
served data alone, considering settings where progres-
sively more information is available. In each setting,
we show that the information gained about the unob-
served confounder is insuﬃcient to pinpoint a single
causal conclusion from the observed data. In the end,
we show that parametric assumptions are necessary
to identify causal quantities of interest in this setting.
This suggests caution when drawing causal inferences
in this setting, whether one is using ﬂexible modeling
and machine learning methods or parametric models.
Despite these negative results, we discuss how it is still
possible to make progress in this setting under minor
modiﬁcations to either the data collection or estima-
tion objective. We highlight two alternatives. First,
we discuss estimation with proxy variables, which can
be used to identify causal estimands without paramet-
ric assumptions by adding a small number of variables
to the multi-cause setting (Miao et al., 2016; Louizos
et al., 2017). Secondly, we discuss sensitivity analy-
sis, which gives a principled approach to exploring the
set of causal conclusions that are compatible with the
distribution of observed data.

RELATED WORK
This paper primarily engages with the young litera-
ture on multi-cause causal inference whose primary
audience has been the machine learning community.
This line of work is motivated by several applications,
including genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
(Tran and Blei, 2017), recommender systems (Wang
et al., 2018), and medicine (Ranganath and Perotte,
2018). Wang and Blei (2018) include a thorough re-
view of this line of work and application areas.
These papers can be seen as an extension of factor
models to causal settings. Identiﬁcation in factor mod-
els is an old topic. The foundational results in this area
are due to Kruskal (1989) and were extended to a wide
variety of settings by Allman et al. (2009). For more
elementary results similar to those in our ﬁrst coun-
terexample, see Bollen (1989) or similar introductory
texts on factor analysis.
The approach taken in this paper is an example of sen-
sitivity analysis, which is a central technique for assess-
ing the robustness of conclusions in causal inference.
One prominent approach, due to Rosenbaum and Ru-
bin (1983) posits the existence of a latent confounder,
and maps out the causal conclusions that result when
unidentiﬁed parameters in this model are assumed to
take certain values. Our second counterexample takes
inspiration from the model suggested in this paper.

NOTATION AND
PRELIMINARIES
Consider a problem where one hopes to learn how
multiple inputs aﬀect an outcome.
Let A
=
(A(1), . . . , A(m)) be a vector of m variables (causes)
whose causal eﬀects we wish to infer, and let Y be
the scalar outcome variable of interest. We write the
supports of A and Y as A and Y, repsectively. For
example, suppose that A corresponds a set of genes
that a scientist could, in principle, knock out by gene
editing, where A(k) = 1 if the gene remains active and
A(k) = 0 if it is knocked out. In this case, the scien-
tist may be interested in predicting a measure of cell
growth Y if various interventions were applied. For-
mally, we represent this quantity of interest using the
do-operator:
P(Y | do(A)),
which represents the family of distributions of the out-
come Y when the causes A are set to arbitrary values
in A (Pearl, 2009).
In general, it is diﬃcult to infer P(Y | do(A)) from ob-
servational, or non-experimental, data because there
may be background factors, or confounders, that drive
both the outcome Y and the observed causes A. We
represent these confounders with the variable U, with
support U. In the presence of such confounders, the
conditional distribution P(Y | A) may be diﬀerent
from the intervention distribution P(Y | do(A)).
If U is observed, the following assumptions are suﬃ-
cient to identify the intervention distribution:
• Unconfoundedness:
U
blocks all backdoor
paths between A and Y , and
• Positivity: P(A = a | U) > 0 almost surely for
each a ∈A.
Importantly, under these conditions, no parametric as-
sumptions are necessary to identify the intervention
distribution. We say that the intervention distribution
is nonparametrically identiﬁed under these conditions.
The unconfoundedness assumption ensures that the
following relation holds between the unobservable in-
tervention distribution and the observable distribu-
tions:
P(Y | do(A = a)) = E[P(Y | do(A = a), U)]
= E[P(Y | A = a, U)]
=
Z
U
P(Y | A = a, U = u)P(U = u)du.
(1)
We will call P(Y | A, U) the conditional outcome dis-
tribution, and P(U) the integrating measure. Mean-
while, the postivity assumption ensures that all pairs
(A, U) are observable in the support of U, so that the
integrand in (1) can be evaluated along each point on
the path of the integral. The intervention distribution
P(Y | do(A = a)) is identiﬁed under these conditions
because (1) can be written completely in terms of ob-
servable distributions.

UNOBSERVED CONFOUNDING
AND MULTIPLE CAUSES
When the confounder U is unobserved, the uncon-
foundedness and positivity assumptions are no longer
suﬃcient for P(Y | do(A = a)) to be identiﬁed. In this
case, additional assumptions are necessary because (1)
is no longer a function of observable distributions.
The multi-cause approach attempts to infer (1) from
the observable data (A, Y ) alone under assumptions
about the conditional independence structure of this
distribution. Speciﬁcally, this approach incorporates
the assumption that the observed distribution of
causes P(A) admits a factorization by the unobserved
confounder U. We group these central assumptions in
Assumption 1 below, and illustrate them in Figure 1.

factor model, and are conditionally independent given
U.
In addition, the latent confounder U blocks all
backdoor paths between causes A = (A(1) · · · A(m))
and outcome Y .

tribution of a set of variables A iﬀ

Assumption 1. There exists an unobserved variable
U such that (i) U blocks all backdoor paths from A to
Y and (ii) U factorizes the distribution of A.
Under this assumption, the most general form of multi-
cause causal inference rests on the following identiﬁca-
tion claim.
Claim 1. Under Assumption 1, for any variable V
that factorizes A, the following relation (∗) holds
Z

P(Y | A = a, V = v)P(V = v)dv
(3)
(∗)
=
Z
U
P(Y | A = a, U = u)P(U = u)du
= P(Y | do(A = a)).
If this claim were true, one could obtain an arbitrary
factor model for the observed causes satisfying (2) and
calculate P(Y | do(A)).
In Section 5, we present a simple counterexample that
shows that this claim does not hold in general. The
crux of the counterexample is that factorizations of
P(A) are not always unique, and diﬀerences between
these factorizations can induce diﬀerent values for (3).
In light of this counterexample, it is natural to ask
whether identiﬁcation by (1) is feasible in the special
case that the factorization of P(A) is unique. In this
case, we say the factorization is identiﬁed. Depend-
ing on the speciﬁcation, a factor model may be identi-
ﬁed under fairly weak conditions, especially when the
latent factor U is categorical; Allman et al. (2009)
present a broad set of suﬃcient conditions.
Claim 2. Under Assumption 1, if the factorization of
P(A) is identiﬁed, then the intervention distribution
P(Y | do(A = a)) is identiﬁed by (1).
Ranganath and Perotte (2018) and Tran and Blei
(2017) make a variation of this claim by supposing
that U can be consistently estimated as a function of
A. In this case, the factorization is identiﬁed in the
limit where the number of causes m grows large.
Claim 3. Under Assumption 1, if there exists an es-
timator of U that is a function of A, ˆU(A), such that
ˆU(A)

then the intervention distribution is identiﬁed by
P(Y | do(A = a)) =
Z
U
P(Y | A = a, ˆU(A) = u)P( ˆU(A) = u)du. (4)
In Section 6, we give a counterexample and a theorem
showing that Claim 2 is false except in the trivial case
that the observational and intervention distributions
coincide; that is, P(Y | do(A = a)) = P(Y | A = a).
In a supporting proposition for this result, we show
speciﬁcally that Claim 3 is false because the consis-
tency premise implies that the positivity assumption
is violated.

FACTORIZATION EXISTENCE IS
INSUFFICIENT
5.1
Setup
In this section, we show that Claim 1 is false by a thor-
ough exploration of a counterexample. Speciﬁcally, we
show that, even under Assumption 1, it is possible that
the observed data is compatible with many distinct in-
tevention distributions P(Y | do(A)).
Consider a simple setting where all variables are lin-
early related, and all independent errors are Gaussian.
Letting ϵw ∼N(0, σ2
w) for each w ∈{A, Y, U}, the
structural equations for this setting are
U := ϵU
A := αU + ϵA
Y := β⊤A + γU + ϵY
Here, α, β are m × 1 column vectors, and γ is a scalar;
ϵA is a m × 1 random column vector, and ϵY , ϵU are
random scalars. This data-generating process satisﬁes
Assumption 1.
Under this model, the intervention distribution has the
following form:
P(Y | do(A = a)) = N(β⊤a, γ2σ2
U + σ2
Y ).
We will focus speciﬁcally on estimating the conditional
E[Y | do(A = a)], which is fully parameterized by β.

Multi-Cause Causal Inference: Counterexamples, Impossibility, Alternatives
Thus, our goal is to recover β from the distribution of
observed data.
The covariance matrix can be written as
ΣAY U =


ΣUU
ΣUA
ΣUY
ΣAU
ΣAA
ΣAY
ΣY U
ΣY A
ΣY Y


where ΣAA is m × m, ΣAY = Σ⊤
Y A is m × 1, and ΣY Y
is 1 × 1.
The marginal covariance matrix of the observable vari-
ables (A, Y ) is the bottom-right 2×2 sub-matrix of this
matrix. Its entries are deﬁned by:
ΣAA = αα⊤σ2
U + diag(σ2
A)
ΣAY = ΣAAβ + γσ2
Uα
ΣY Y = (β⊤α + γ)2σ2
U + β⊤diag(σ2
A)β + σ2
Y
In these equations, the quantity on the LHS is observ-
able, while the structural parameters on the RHS are
unobservable. The goal is to invert these equations to
obtain a unique value for β.
5.2
Equivalence Class Construction
When m ≥3, the number of equations in this model
exceeds the number of unknowns, but there still ex-
ists an equivalence class of structural equations with
parameters
(α1, β1, γ1, σ2
U,1, σ2
A,1, σ2
Y,1) ̸= (α, β, γ, σ2
U, σ2
A, σ2
Y )
that induce the same observable covariance matrix,
and for which β1 ̸= β. These parmeterizations can-
not be distinguished by observed data. In this section,
we show how to construct such a class.
The key to this argument is that the scale of U is not
identiﬁed given A, regardless of the number of causes
m. This is a well-known non-identiﬁcation result in
conﬁrmatory factor analysis (e.g., Bollen, 1989, Chap-
ter 7). In our example, the expression for ΣAA does
not change when α and σ2
U are replaced with the struc-
tural parameters α1 and σ2
U,1:
α1 := c · α
σ2
U,1 := σ2
U/c2.
In the following proposition, we state how the remain-
ing structural variables can be adjusted to maintain
the same observable covariance matrix when the scale
c is changed.
Proposition 1. For any ﬁxed vector of parameters
(α, β, γ, σ2
U, σ2
A, σ2
Y ) and a valid scaling factor c (de-
ﬁned below), there exists a vector of parameters that

We call the set of all parameter vectors that correspond

eter space. Parameters in the ignorance region cannot
be distinguished on the basis of observed data because
they all imply the same observed data distribution.
We plot an illustration of the ignorance region for β
from a numerical example in Figure 2.
In this ex-
ample, we set β = b · 1m×1 and α = a · 1m×1 to be
constant vectors for some constants a and b. In this
case β1(c) = s(c) · b · 1m×1 is a simple scaling of β, so
the ignorance region can be represented by the value
of this scalar s(c). In this example, the data cannot
distinguish between eﬀect vectors that have the oppo-
site sign of the true eﬀect vector β, and those those
that overstate the eﬀect of A by nearly a factor of 2.

Large-m Asymptotics
The ignorance region does not in general disappear
in the large treatment number (large-m) limit. Here,
we extend our example to an asymptotic frame where
the ignorance region maintains the same (multiplica-
tive) size even as m goes to inﬁnity. Consider a se-
quence of problems where the number of treatments
analyzed in each problem is increasing in the se-
quence.
Each problem has its own data generating
process, with some structural parameters indexed by
m: (αm, βm, γ, σ2
U, σ2
A,m, σ2
Y ). We keep the scalar pa-
rameters not indexed by m ﬁxed.
We consider the marginal variance of each A to be
ﬁxed, so for some ﬁxed scalar s2
0, for each problem m,
σ2
A,m = 1m×1s2
0.
Likewise, we expect the marginal variance of Y to be
relatively stable, no matter how many treatments we
choose to analyze. Given our setup, this means that if
the number of treatments is large, the eﬀect of each in-
dividual treatment on average needs to become smaller
as m grows large, or else the variance of Y would
increase in m (this is clear from the speciﬁcation of
ΣY Y ). To handle this, we ﬁx some constant scalars a0
and b0 and assume that, for problem m,
αm = 1m×1 · a0/√m;
βm = 1m×1 · b0/√m.
Thus, as m →∞, the norms of αm and βm, as well
as their inner product α⊤
mβm, which appears in the
expression for ΣY Y , remain ﬁxed. 1
Under this setup, the interval of valid values for the
latent scaling factor c remains ﬁxed for any value of
m.For a ﬁxed c in this interval, we examine how the
corresponding shift vector ∆β,m(c) = β1(c)−β behaves
as m grows large. The components of the shift ∆β,m(c)
scale as m−1/2.

Morrison formula,

FACTORIZATION UNIQUENESS
IS INSUFFICIENT
6.1
Impossibility of Nonparametric
Identiﬁcation
In this section, we consider identiﬁcation in the multi-
cause setting in the special case where the factoriza-
tion of P(A) by U is unique; that is, we consider the
case where P(A) can be decomposed uniquely into a
mixing measure P(U) and a conditional treatment dis-
tribution P(A | U). In this setting, Claims 2 and 3
assert that P(Y | do(A)) is identiﬁed by (1).
This
claim arises as a natural response to the counterexam-
ple in the last section, where the non-uniqueness of the
factorization contributes to non-identiﬁcation.
As in the last section, we show via counterexample
that the conditions in these claims are insuﬃcient for
identiﬁcation of P(Y | do(A)). In addition, we show
that, in general, parametric assumptions about the
conditional outcome distribution P(Y | U, A) are nec-
essary to identify P(Y | do(A)), except in the case
where there is no confounding, i.e., the intervention
distribution P(Y
| do(A)) and the observed condi-
tional distribution P(Y | A) are equal almost every-
where. We summarize this statement in the following
theorem.
Theorem 1. Suppose that Assumption 1 holds, that
P(U, A) is identiﬁed, and that the model for P(Y |
U, A) is not subject to parametric restrictions.
Then either P(Y | do(A)) = P(Y | A) almost every-
where, or P(Y | do(A)) is not identiﬁed.
Put another way, our theorem states that nonparamet-
ric identiﬁcation is impossible in this setting, except
in the trivial case. In this section, we prove two sup-
porting propositions for this theorem and demonstrate
them in the context of our running example. The proof
of the theorem, which follows almost immediately from
these propositions, appears at the end of the section.
6.2
Counterexample Setup
Let U
be a binary latent variable,
and A
:=
(A(1), · · · , A(m)) a vector of m binary causes. In the
structural model, we assume that the individual causes

Multi-Cause Causal Inference: Counterexamples, Impossibility, Alternatives
A(k) are generated independently and identically as a
function of U. Let the outcome Y be binary, and gen-
erated as a function of U and A.
U := Bern(πU)
A(k) := Bern(pA(U))
k = 1, · · · , m
Y := Bern(pY (U, A))
In addition to this structural model, we assume that
m ≥3 and that pA(U) is a non-trivial function of U.
These assumptions are suﬃcient for the factorization
of P(A) by U to be unique (Kruskal, 1989; Allman
et al., 2009). Thus, this example satisﬁes the premise
of Claim 2.
Our goal is to estimate the intervention distribution
for each a ∈A using the identity in (1). Here, the
intervention distribution can be summarized by the
following causal parameter:
πY |do(a) := P(Y = 1 | do(A = a))
= (1 −πU)pY (0, a) + πUpY (1, a).
(6)
Because the factorization of P(A) is identiﬁed, πU and
pA(U) are identiﬁable. Thus, to calculate (6), it re-
mains to recover pY (U, A) = P(Y = 1 | U, A).
We will show that this conditional probability cannot
be recovered from the observed data. Our approach
will be to analyze the residual distribution P(Y, U |
A = a). For each value A = a, we can characterize
P(U, Y | A = a) by 4 probabilities in a 2×2 table (see
Figure 3). We use shorthand notation puy|a := P(U =
u, Y = y | A = a) to denote the value in each cell of
this table. The values in this table are unobservable,
but they are subject to several constraints. The entries
of this table are constrained to be positive and sum
to 1. In addition, because P(Y, A) and P(U, A) are
identiﬁed, the margins of the table are constrained to
be equal to probabilities given by P(Y | A = a) and
P(U | A = a). We refer to these probabilities with
the shorthand πY |a := P(Y = 1 | A = a) and πU|a :=
P(U = 1 | A = a). Using this notation, we can rewrite
(1) as:
πY |do(a) = (1 −πU)
p01|a
1 −πU|a
+ πU
p11|a
πU|a
.
(7)
We consider identiﬁcation in two separate cases, de-
pending on the amount of information about U is con-
tained in the event A = a. We ﬁrst consider the case
where P(U | A = a) is non-degenerate, so that there
is residual uncertainty about U after A is observed.
We then consider the degenerate case, where U can be
deterministically reconstructed as a function of A (the
premise of Claim 3).

the factor model for P(U) is identiﬁed, the observed
data ﬁx the margins of the table, but leave one degree
of freedom unidentiﬁed.
6.3
Non-Degenerate Case
When P(U | A = a) is not degenerate, the table in
Figure 3 is underdetermined by the data, and has one
remaining degree of freedom. This degree of freedom
determines the dependence between Y and U con-
ditional on A.
We parameterize this dependence in
terms of p11|a := P(U = 1, Y = 1 | A = a). For pur-
poses of interpretation, p11|a is linearly related to the
cor(U, Y, | A = a) (Joe, 1997, Sec 7.1.1):
cor(U, Y | A = a) =
p11|a −πU|aπY |a
πU|a(1 −πU|a)πY |a(1 −πY |a).
The constraints on the table constrain p11|a to lie in
the following range (Joe, 1997):
max{0, πU|a + πY |a −1} ≤p11|a ≤min{πU|a, πY |a}.
(8)
Fixing a value for p11|a in this range determines the
values of all four cells in the table which, in turn, de-
termine the causal parameter πY |do(a) by (7).
By varying p11|a in the valid range (8), we can generate
the ignorance region of πY |do(a) values that are equiva-
lently compatible with the observed data. To demon-
strate, we instantiate the model with m = 6 causes.
To simplify plotting, we specify P(Y | U, A) so that it
only depends on S(A) = Pm
k=1 A(k). This ensures that
inferences about πY |do(a) only depend on S(a). In Fig-
ure 4, we plot ignorance regions for πY |do(a) indexed
by S(a).
The ﬁgure demonstrates that in this simple example,
P(Y | do(A)) is not identiﬁed in general. Speciﬁcally,
for all vectors a where S(a) ̸= 3, the ignorance region

is non-trivial. For each S(a), the extreme points of the
ignorance region correspond to the extreme values of
p11|a compatible with the margins given by P(Y | A)
and P(U | A). The true causal parameters P(Y = 1 |
do(A = a)) and the observational parameters P(Y =
1 | A = a) are always contained in this region. In some
cases, the ignorance region is large relative to the [0, 1]
interval.
Figure 4 also shows a trivial case, where P(Y | do(A =
a)) = P(Y | A = a), and thus the intervention dis-
tribution is identiﬁed despite p11|a being underdeter-
mined. This case arises because we deﬁned the struc-
tural parameters such that pA(1) = 1 −pA(0), which
ensures that when S(a) = m/2 = 3, P(U | A = a) =
P(U), and thus P(Y | do(A = a)) = P(Y | A = a).
6.4
Copula Non-Identiﬁcation in General
The non-identiﬁcation in the above example occurs
generally when P(Y | U, A) is nonparametric.
We
state this in the following supporting proposition for
Theorem 1. For the general case, we represent the un-
derdetermined degree of freedom by the copula den-
sity:
c(Y, U | A) :=
P(Y, U | A)
P(Y | A)P(U | A),
which speciﬁes the dependence between Y and U given
A, independently of the margins P(Y | A) and P(U |
A) (see, e.g., Nelsen, 2007). In the following proposi-
tion, we show in a very general setting that this copula
is not identiﬁed, and that this non-identiﬁcation pre-
cludes identiﬁcation of P(Y | do(A)).
Proposition 2. In the setting of Theorem 1, suppose
that P(U | A) is almost surely non-degenerate. Then,
the following are true
1. The copula density c(Y, U | A) is not identiﬁed.
2. Either P(Y | do(A)) = P(Y | A), or P(Y | do(A))
is not identiﬁed.
Proof. For the ﬁrst statement, the joint distribution
P(U, Y, A) can be written
P(U, A, Y ) = P(A)P(Y | A)P(U | A)c(Y, U | A),
By assumption, P(Y, A) and P(U, A) are identiﬁed,
but the copula density c(Y, U | A) remains unspeciﬁed
because there are no restrictions on P(Y | U, A).
For the second statement, note that the independence
copula c(Y, U | A) = 1 is compatible with the ob-
served data, as a result of the ﬁrst statement. Under
the independence copula, P(Y | do(A)) = P(Y | A).
If this causal hypothesis is not true, then the true
P(Y | do(A)) is also compatible with the observed
data, so multiple causal hypotheses are compatible

Multi-Cause Causal Inference: Counterexamples, Impossibility, Alternatives
with the observed data, and P(Y | do(A = a)) is not
identiﬁed.
6.5
Degenerate Case
We now continue our example and consider the case,
invoked in Claim 3, where P(U | A) is degenerate al-
most everywhere, i.e., where for any observable unit,
U can be written as a deterministic function of A. In
this case, the copula P(U, Y | A) is trivial, so the non-
identiﬁcation in Proposition 2 is not an issue. How-
ever, P(Y | do(A)) remains unidentiﬁed in this setting
because the degeneracy of P(U | A) implies that the
positivity assumption is violated.
This case is invoked asymptotically, so we analyze our
example as the number of causes grows large. First,
we show that U can indeed be consistently estimated
from A. As m grows large, the unobserved confounder
U can be estimated perfectly for any unit, up to label-
switching. Speciﬁcally, by the strong law of large num-
bers, for any unit with U = u, as m grows large,
ˆp(A) := S(A)/m
a.s.
→pA(u).
From this fact, and our assumption that pA(u) is a
non-trivial function of u, we can construct consistent
estimators ˆU(A) for U. For example, letting I{·} be
an indicator function,
ˆU(A) := I

ˆp(A) > pA(1) + pA(0)

is consistent as m grows large.
However, as m grows large, the causes A begin to
occupy disjoint regions of the cause space A, induc-
ing a violation of the positivity assumption. This is
the same phenomenon that drives the consistency of
ˆU(A). We illustrate in Figure 5, where we plot sam-
ples of the causes A at various values of m, projected
into two dimensions and scaled. The ﬁrst dimension
is obtained by calculating ˆp(A), expressed as a lin-
ear operator: ˆp(A) = A⊤(m−1 · 1m×1). The second
dimension is obtained by projecting A onto a vector
orthogonal to 1m×1. In this case, we choose the vec-
tor v2 = m−1/2 · (1⊤
(m/2)×1, −1⊤
(m/2)×1)⊤and calcu-
late A⊤v2. When m is small, A has the same support
whether U = 0 or U = 1, but as m grows, the causes
A concentrate on either side of the decision bound-
ary of our estimator ˆU(A), ensuring consistency of the
estimator, but violating positivity.
Because of this phenomenon, the conditional proba-
bilities P(Y = 1 | U = 0, ˆU(A) = 1) and P(Y = 1 |
ˆU(A) = 0, U = 1) are inestimable from the data in the
large-m limit, and we cannot evaluate (6). At best, we
can bound (6) by substituting extreme values 0 and 1
for the inestimable probabilities.
This problem is not merely asymptotic; it also mani-
fests for ﬁnite m, when the residual uncertainty about
U after observing A is small.
Consider the 2 × 2
table in Figure 3 corresponding to a cause vector a
for which πU|a = ϵ for some small epsilon satisfying
ϵ < min{πY |a, 1 −πY |a}.
The bounds in (8) imply
that p11|a ∈[0, ϵ], such that
P(Y = 1 | U = 1, A = a) ∈[0, 1],
i.e., the data provide no information about this condi-
tional probability. In the limit, as ϵ →0, the ignorance
region has the form
πY |do(a) ∈(1 −πU)P(Y = 1 | A = a) + [0, πU].
Similarly, for cases where πU|a approaches 1, the data
provide no information about P(Y | U = 0, A = a),
and the ignorance region has width equal to 1 −πU.
This regime appears in Figure 4 for small and large
values of S(a), where the ignorance region widths ap-
proach πU = 0.3 and 1 −πU = 0.7, respectively. As
m grows large, the probability that a sampled cause
vector A falls in this regime approaches 1.
6.6
Consistency and Positivity in General
The above positivity violation occurs in any case where
the latent confounder U can be reconstructed consis-
tently from the causes A. We summarize this fact in
the following supporting proposition for Theorem 1.
The central idea of this result is as follows: when ˆU(A)
is consistent in the large m limit, the event U = u
implies that A takes a value a such that ˆU(a) = u.
Thus, for distinct values of the latent variable U, the
observed causes A must lie in disjoint regions of the
cause space, violating positivity.
Proposition 3. Suppose that Assumption 1 holds,
that P(U) is not degenerate, and that there exists a
consistent estimator ˆU(Am) of U as m grows large.
Then positivity is violated as m grows large.
Proof. Because P(U) is non-degenerate, U takes on
multiple values with positive probability. In this case,
we establish that Am concentrates in diﬀerent sets of
Am depending on the value of U. For each m and each
latent variable value u in the support of U, deﬁne the
set
Em(u) = {am : ˆU(am) ̸= u}.
Em(u) is the set of cause vector values am ∈Am that
ˆU(·) would map to a value other than u.
Because
ˆU(Am) is consistent, for each u in the support of U,
as m grows large,
P(Am ∈Em(u) | U = u) = P( ˆU(Am) ̸= u | U = u) →0.

confounder U. Here, v1 = m−1 · 1m×1, such that A⊤v1 = S(A)/m = ˆp(A), and v2 is a vector orthogonal to v1,
scaled by m−1/2. These values are generated according to the model in Section 6. As m, the dimension of A,
increases, the treatment vectors A generated under each value of U become more distinct. We take advantage of
this distinctness to estimate U consistently; as m grows large, the black boundary encodes an estimator ˆU(A)
that calls U = 0 if a point lands to the left of the line, and U = 1 if it lands to the right. However, this separation
between red squares and blue circles also indicates a positivity violation.
Likewise, for any u′ ̸= u in the support of U,
P(A ∈Em(u) | U = u′) = P( ˆU(Am) ̸= u | U = u′) →1.
Thus, positivity is violated.
6.7
Proof of Theorem 1
We conclude with a proof of Theorem 1.
Proof. One of two cases must hold:
P(U | A) is
either degenerate almost everywhere, or not.
In
the non-degenerate case, Proposition 2 proves non-
identiﬁcation, except in the trivial case.
In the degnerate case, there are again two cases: either
P(U) is degenerate, or not. If P(U) is not degener-
ate, Proposition 3 shows that the positivity assump-
tion fails, and because P(Y | U, A) is nonparametric
by assumption, P(Y | U, A) is inestimable for some
(u, a) ∈U × A, and (1) is not identiﬁed. If P(U) is
degenerate, then the latent variable does not induce
any confounding, and P(Y | do(A)) = P(Y | A).

DISCUSSION
7.1
Practical Implications
In this section, we discuss practical implications of our
negative results, then end on a more hopeful note, and
suggest some constructive ways forward.
We put the bad news ﬁrst. Theorem 1 suggests that
one should generally be cautious about drawing causal
inferences in the multi-cause setting. Speciﬁcally, the
existence of a non-trivial ignorance region can make
conclusions highly dependent on modeling choices that
in other contexts would be innocuous. On one hand,
ﬂexible, nonparametric models are likely to behave un-
predictably when they are used to estimate causal ef-
fects in this setting.
In particular, within the igno-
rance region, point estimates will be driven primarily
by choices of regularization. To demonstrate this, we
plot the results of an estimation experiment on the
right of Figure 4.
In this experiment, we estimate
πy|do(a) for a given vector a from 15,000 datapoints
drawn from the binary example’s data generating pro-
cess. We perform estimation by maximum likelihood,
but we add a weak L2 penalty term on the log-odds ra-
tio γ := log
 p11|a
p10|a
. p01|a
p00|a

, which pushes estimates of
p11|a to take speciﬁc values. As expected, the penalty
determines where in the ignorance region the estimate
appears. This behavior can be unpredictable in com-
plex problems, especially when applying estimation
methods that involve tuning parameters or stochastic
training.
On the other hand, one may be able to obtain nu-
merically stable estimates of causal eﬀects with para-
metric assumptions in this setting, e.g., assuming that
E[Y
| U, A] is linear, but our results still suggest
caution, unless one has strong prior knowledge that
the parametric speciﬁcation is correct. Parametric as-
sumptions can induce identiﬁcation in this setting, but
this can be diﬃcult to conﬁrm without formal analysis
of the model, as our ﬁrst counterexample suggests. In

Multi-Cause Causal Inference: Counterexamples, Impossibility, Alternatives
addition, because of the lack of nonparametric identiﬁ-
cation, if one does obtain identiﬁcation via parametric
assumptions, the parts of these assumptions that de-
termine result of the analysis cannot be checked: the
data will be indiﬀerent to diﬀerent parametric speciﬁ-
cations that yield diﬀerent estimates in the ignorance
region. Finally, uncertainty estimates obtained under
parametric speciﬁcations may not faithfully represent
this sensitivity to functional form.
7.2
Proxy Variables
Despite these negative results, there are straightfor-
ward modiﬁcations to the multi-cause setting that can
yield nonparametric identiﬁcation. One alternative is
to incorporate proxy variables (a.k.a.
negative con-
trols) into the estimation procedure. A proxy variable
Z is a supplementary variable that is downstream of
the latent confounder U, but is causally unrelated to
either the outcome Y or the cause variables A. Several
authors have given suﬃcient conditions for causal iden-
tiﬁcation when using proxy variables in the presence of
unobserved confounding (see, e.g., Kuroki and Pearl,
2014; Miao et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2018). Recently,
Louizos et al. (2017) applied these results to estimate
causal eﬀects by calculating (1) from the posterior dis-
tribution of a variational autoencoder model.
Adding proxy variables to an analysis requires collect-
ing a slightly larger dataset, but it is plausible that in
many multi-cause settings collecting the appropriate
variables would not be onerous. For example, the suf-
ﬁcient conditions for nonparametric identiﬁcation in
Miao et al. (2016) require the addition of two proxy
variables, one conditionally independent of A given U,
and the other conditionally independent of Y given
U.
In the multi-cause setting, it is not diﬃcult to
ﬁnd a proxy of the ﬁrst type; each cause variable A(k)
satisﬁes this condition. Similarly, it is plausible that
proxies of the second type would be readily available
in many contexts that could be framed as multi-cause
causal inference problems, e.g., GWAS (Tran and Blei,
2017) or recommender systems (Wang et al., 2018).
For example, if the number of causes m is large because
A includes causes that span a large set of functions,
then it may be plausible to designate some loosely re-
lated causes as proxies of this second type. Likewise,
in cases where the latent confounder is shared by two
outcomes Y (1) and Y (2) that are conditionally inde-
pendent given U, each outcome can serve as a proxy
in estimating the intervention distribution of the other.
To demonstrate that the proxy approach addresses
some of the pathologies highlighted here, we repeat
the estimation experiment on the right side of Fig-
ure 4, adding two proxy variables to the data.
As
in Section 7.1, we estimate the model parameters by
maximum likelihood estimation for varying settings of
a weak regularizer. In this case, the regularizer has
negligible eﬀect on the estimates of πY |do(a), although
the estimates show signiﬁcant variability.
7.3
Sensitivity Analysis
To close, we note that the multi-cause setting could
present a fruitful use case for sensitivity analysis as an
alternative to point estimation of causal estimands.
In such a case, rather than focus on point-identifying
a causal estimand under strong assumptions, it can
be useful to relax our requirements, and attempt to
identify an ignorance region under weaker assumptions
(see, e.g., Manski, 2009). The multi-cause setting is
particularly amenable to sensitivity analysis, because
the assumptions about factorizations of P(A) repre-
sent a reasonable middle ground between the strong
assumption of no unobserved confounding at one ex-
treme and the weak assumption of unstructured con-
founding on the other. For example, although we pre-
sented it as a negative result before, Assumption 1 in-
duced ignorance regions obtained in Figure 4 that are
relatively narrow for some values of a; for some appli-
cations, analyses that explicitly map these sensitivity
regions could acceptably informative.
As a bonus, sensitivity analyses can often be applied
post hoc, so that an investigator is ﬁrst free to ﬁnd
a best-ﬁtting model for the observed data, and then
reason about the causal implications of the model sep-
arately (Franks et al., 2018).
We leave adaptation
of such methods to the multi-cause setting for future
work.
