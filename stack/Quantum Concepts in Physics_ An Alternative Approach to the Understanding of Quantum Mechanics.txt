Quantum Concepts in Physics
Written for advanced undergraduates, physicists, and historians and philosophers of physics,
this book tells the story of the development of our understanding of quantum phenomena
through the extraordinary years of the ﬁrst three decades of the twentieth century.
Rather than following the standard axiomatic approach, this book adopts a histori-
cal perspective, explaining clearly and authoritatively how pioneers such as Heisenberg,
Schr¨odinger, Pauli and Dirac developed the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and
merged them into a coherent theory, and why the mathematical infrastructure of quan-
tum mechanics has to be as complex as it is. The author creates a compelling narrative,
providing a remarkable example of how physics and mathematics work in practice. The
book encourages an enhanced appreciation of the interactions between mathematics, theory
and experiment, helping the reader gain a deeper understanding of the development and
content of quantum mechanics than with any other text at this level.

Preface
How this book came about
This book is the outcome of a long cherished ambition to write a follow-up to my book
Theoretical Concepts in Physics (TCP2) (Longair, 2003). In that book, I took the story of
the development of theoretical concepts in physics up to the discovery of quanta and the
acceptance by the physics community that quanta and quantisation are essential features of
the new physics of the early twentieth century. There was neither space nor scope to take
that story further – it was just too complicated and would have required more advanced
mathematics than I wished to include in that volume.
This book is my attempt to do for quantum mechanics what I did for classical physics
and relativity in TCP2. The objective is to try to reconstruct as closely as possible the
way in which quantum mechanics was created out of a mass of diverse experimental data
and mathematical analyses through the period from about 1900 to 1930. In my view,
quantisation and quanta are the greatest discoveries in the physics of the twentieth century.
The phenomena of quantum mechanics have no direct impact upon our consciousness
which to all intents and purposes is a world dominated by classical physics. But quantum
mechanics underlies all the phenomena of matter and radiation and is the basis of essentially
all aspects of civilisation in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
There is no lack of excellent books on quantum mechanics which is one of the staples of all
courses in undergraduate physics. Most of the successful texts adopt an axiomatic approach
in which quantum mechanics is derived from a set of basic axioms, the consequences
of which are elucidated in the subsequent mathematical elaboration. The ﬁrst complete
exposition of this approach was Dirac’s classic book Principles of Quantum Mechanics of
1930 which may be thought of as the ultimate goal of this book (Dirac, 1930a). But how
did it all come about? Can we understand why the theory has to be as complex as it is and
how did the interpretation of the formalism come about?
Just as the core of TCP2 was inspired by the essays of Martin J. Klein (1967), so this
book was inspired long ago by the book Sources of Quantum Mechanics edited by B. L. van
der Waerden (1967). I had an ambition to use van der Waerden’s book as the basis of the
equivalent of TCP2 for the development of quantum mechanics. This was reinforced by
the appearance of the massive six-volume series The Historical Development of Quantum
Theory by Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg which provides a very thorough, au-
thoritative survey of the history of quantum mechanics and which were published between
1982 and 2001 (Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982a,b,c,d, 1987, 2000, 2001). Equally inspiring

Preface
was The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics by Max Jammer which covers
similar ground in a single volume (Jammer, 1989). Another inspiration was the book Inward
Bound by Abraham Pais (1985) which sets the development of quantum mechanics and
quantum phenomena in a much longer time-frame. In my view, these truly excellent books
are quite hard work and can only be readily appreciated by those who already have a strong
foundation in classical and quantum physics. They are quite a challenge for those seeking
more readily accessible enlightenment.
The historical approach and level of presentation
The experience of teaching and writing a number of books convinced me of the value of
rethinking the foundations of physics from a somewhat historical perspective, at the same
time making as few assumptions as is reasonable about the mathematical sophistication of
the reader. As in TCP2, I assume some ﬂuency in physics and mathematics, but nothing
that would be beyond the ﬁrst couple of years of the typical course in physics. It is useful
to restate some of the objectives of TCP2 which apply equally to the approach adopted in
this book, in contrast to the standard way in which the subject is tackled.
The origin of TCP2 can be traced to discussions in the Cavendish Laboratory in the mid-
1970s among those of us who were involved in teaching theoretically biased undergraduate
courses. There was a feeling that the syllabuses lacked coherence from the theoretical
perspective and that the students were not quite clear about the scope of physics as opposed
to theoretical physics. As our ideas evolved, it became apparent that a discussion of these
ideas would be of value for all ﬁnal-year students. The course entitled Theoretical Concepts
in Physics was therefore designed to be given in the summer term in July and August to
undergraduates entering their ﬁnal year. It was to be strictly non-examinable and entirely
optional. Students obtained no credit from having attended the course beyond an increased
appreciation of physics and theoretical physics. I was invited to give this course of lectures
for the ﬁrst time, with the considerable challenge of attracting students to 9.00 am lectures on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays during the most glorious summer months in Cambridge.
The course was designed to contain the following elements:
(a) The interaction between experiment and theory. Particular stress would be laid upon
the importance of experiment and, in particular, the role of advanced technology in
leading to theoretical insights.
(b) The importance of having available the appropriate mathematical tools for tackling
theoretical problems.
(c) The theoretical background to the basic concepts of modern physics, emphasising
underlying themes such as symmetry, conservation, invariance, and so on.
(d) The role of approximations and models in physics.
(e) The analysis of real scientiﬁc papers in theoretical physics, providing insight into how
professional physicists tackle real problems.

Preface
(f) The consolidation and revision of many of the basic physical concepts which all ﬁnal-
year undergraduates can reasonably be expected to have at their ﬁngertips.
(g) Finally, to convey my own personal enthusiasm for physics and theoretical physics.
My own research has been in high energy astrophysics and astrophysical cosmology,
but I remain a physicist at heart. My own view is that astronomy, astrophysics and
cosmology are no more than subsets of physics, but applied to the Universe on the large
scale. I am one of the very lucky generation who began research in astrophysics in
the early 1960s and who have witnessed the astonishing revolutions which have taken
place in our understanding of all aspects of the physics of the Universe. But, the same
can be said of all areas of physics. The subject is not a dead, pedagogic discipline, the
only object of which is to provide examination questions for students. It is an active,
extensive subject in a robust state of good health.
My objective in writing Quantum Concepts in Physics has been to adopt the same user-
friendly approach as in TCP2 but now applied to the discovery of quantum mechanics.
I should emphasise that this is a personal approach to the understanding of quantum
mechanics, but it has the great virtue of forcing the writer and reader to think hard about the
issues at stake at each stage in the development through one of the most dramatic periods
in the evolution of our understanding of fundamental processes in physics. One of the
differences as compared with TCP2 is that somewhat more advanced mathematical tools
have to be introduced to appreciate the full essence of the story. I have tried to lay out the
necessary mathematics in as simple a form as I could devise, without sacriﬁcing rigour. In
my view, ﬁnal-year undergraduates and their teachers should have little trouble in coping
with these requirements.
Let me also emphasise that this book is not a textbook on quantum mechanics. It is
certainly not a substitute for the systematic development of these topics through the standard
axiomatic approach to the discipline. You should regard this book as a supplement to the
standard courses, but one which I hope will enhance your understanding, appreciation and
enjoyment of the physics. Certainly, I have learned a huge amount about quantum mechanics
through studying the works of genius of the pioneers of the subject.
The challenge
Let me make it clear at the outset that the amount of material which has to be condensed
into a single manageable volume is immense. Some impression of the magnitude of the
task can be appreciated from the almost 4500 pages of the magniﬁcent series by Mehra and
Rechenberg. In addition, the history of physics literature is vast. As a result, I have had to
be selective, and although the course is tortuous, I have had to streamline the story to reach
my goal in a ﬁnite space. For further enlightenment, which I thoroughly recommend, there
is no alternative but to delve into the writings of Mehra, Rechenberg, Jammer, Pais and the
many other authors cited in the text.

Preface
I should also confess that, although I have taught numerous courses on quantum physics,
I do not regard myself as a ‘black-belt’ quantum physicist. This has the advantage that I
am embarking on a voyage of personal intellectual discovery as well. I like very much the
splendid remark of Fitzgerald,
‘A Briton wants emotion in his science, something to raise enthusiasm, something with
human interest.’ (Fitzgerald, 1902)
I confess to belonging to that school. I hope you will enjoy this adventure as much as I do.

I have greatly beneﬁtted from interactions with many colleagues in the Cavendish Labo-
ratory over the years while this project has been mulled over in my mind. These began in
the 1970s when the hot debates in the Cavendish Teaching Committee, which I chaired for
a number of years, gave fascinating insights into what my distinguished colleagues con-
sidered to be the central core of physical thinking. The stimulus of giving parallel courses
in undergraduate physics with my colleagues undoubtedly inﬂuenced my understanding.
These colleagues include John Waldram, David Green and Paul Alexander, whose insights I
much appreciate. I also beneﬁtted from the lecture notes in quantum mechanics prepared by
Michael Payne and Howard Hughes, which I have used as reference points in my thinking
to ensure that I was to end up in the right place by the end of the book. Once the writing was
completed, I was most grateful to receive the advice of Malcolm Perry and Anna ˙Zytkow,
who generously scrutinised parts of the text where I felt deeper mathematical insights would
improve the clarity of the exposition – I am most grateful to them for the changes they
recommended and which I implemented.
As in my earlier books, I have greatly beneﬁtted from the advice of David Green on the
subtleties of LaTeX coding. His expert advice has greatly improved the appearance of the text
and the mathematics. I am most grateful to the librarians in the Rayleigh Library, Nevenka
Huntic and Helen Suddaby, who have been unfailingly helpful in tracking down many of
the rarer books and papers referred to in the text. Similar thanks go to Mark Hurn, Librarian
at the Institute of Astronomy, for uncovering various little-known treasures in that library.
I would emphasise that Quantum Concepts in Physics is a much more personal voyage
of discovery than my previous books. I knew what I wanted to achieve at the outset, but the
working out and research were carried out in parallel with the writing. As such, the usual
disclaimers that I am solely responsible for errors of content and judgement are even more
apposite than usual. This is a story which can be told in many different ways, with different
emphases according to the inclination of the writer. It is all the more important that the
reader should consult the many texts referenced in this book to obtain the fuller picture.
As in all my work, the love, support, encouragement and understanding of my family,
Deborah, Mark and Sarah, means more to me than can ever be expressed in words.

Physics and theoretical physics in 1895
1.1 The triumph of nineteenth century physics
The nineteenth century was an era of unprecedented advance in the understanding of the laws
of physics. In mechanics and dynamics, more and more powerful mathematical tools had
been developed to enable complex dynamical problems to be solved. In thermodynamics,
the ﬁrst and second laws were ﬁrmly established, through the efforts of Rudolf Clausius
and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and the full ramiﬁcations of the concept of entropy
for classical thermodynamics were being elaborated. James Clerk Maxwell had derived
the equations of electromagnetism which were convincingly validated by Heinrich Hertz’s
experiments of 1887 to 1889. Light and electromagnetic waves were the same thing, thus
providing a ﬁrm theoretical foundation for the wave theory of light which could account
for virtually all the known phenomena of optics.
Sometimes the impression is given that experimental and theoretical physicists of the
1890s believed that the combination of thermodynamics, electromagnetism and classical
mechanics could account for all known physical phenomena and that all that remained
was to work out the consequences of these recently won achievements. As remarked
by Brian Pippard in his survey of physics in 1900,1 Albert Michelson’s famous remark
that
‘Our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place of decimals.’ (Michelson,
1903)
has often been quoted out of context and is better viewed in the light of Maxwell’s words
in his inaugural lecture as the ﬁrst Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics in 1871:
‘I might bring forward instances gathered from every branch of science, showing how
the labour of careful measurement has been rewarded by the discovery of new ﬁelds of
research, and by the development of new scientiﬁc ideas.’ (Maxwell, 1890)
Maxwell’s prescient words were the battle-cry for the extraordinary events which were
to take place over the succeeding decades. In fact, the late nineteenth century was a period
of ferment in the physical sciences when many awkward fundamental problems remained
to be solved. These exercised the minds of the greatest physicists of the period. Ultimately,
the resolution of these problems was to revolutionise the foundations of physics with the
discovery of the wholly different world of quantum mechanics. Let us begin by reviewing
some of the issues which led to the crisis of early twentieth century physics.2

Physics and theoretical physics in 1895
1.2 Atoms and molecules in the nineteenth century
The origin of the modern concept of atoms and molecules can be traced to the understanding
of the laws of chemistry in the early years of the nineteenth century. In the late eighteenth
century Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier established the law of conservation of mass in chem-
ical reactions. Then, in the period between 1798 and 1804, Joseph Louis Proust established
his law of deﬁnite proportions, according to which:
‘A given chemical compound contains the same elements united in the same ﬁxed pro-
portions by mass.’3
For example, oxygen makes up 8/9 of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen
makes up the remaining 1/9. In 1803, John Dalton followed up this law with his law of
multiple proportions according to which:
‘When two elements combine together to form more than one compound, the weights
of one element which unites with a given weight of the other are in simple multiple
proportion.’
Next, in 1808 Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac published his law of combining volumes of gases,
which states:
‘The volumes of gases taking part in a chemical change either as reagents or as products,
bear a simple numerical relation to one another if all measurements are made under the
same conditions of temperature and pressure.’
For example, two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen in forming two
volumes of water vapour.
These concepts were synthesised and taken much further by Dalton in his inﬂuential
treatise A New System of Chemical Philosophy (Dalton, 1808). He asserted that the ultimate
particles, or atoms, of a chemically homogeneous substance all had the same weight and
shape and drew up a table of the relative weights of the atoms of a number of simple
substances (Fig. 1.1). According to his hypothesis, the atoms are particles of matter which
cannot be subdivided into more primitive forms by chemical processes. Originally, Dalton
and Berzelius considered that equal volumes of gases under identical physical conditions
contain the same number of atoms, but this concept did not agree with the observed
relations of the volumes of different combining gases. The solution was provided by
Amadeo Avogadro who in 1811 realised that the physical unit was not a single atom but
a cluster of a small number of atoms, which he deﬁned as molecules, namely the smallest
particle of the gas which moves about as a whole. Avogardo’s hypothesis then states that:
‘Equal volumes of all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain
the same numbers of molecules.’
A central role in what follows concerned the molecular, or atomic, weight of a substance.
This is deﬁned to be the weight of the particle on a scale in which the oxygen atom has
weight 16 units. Correspondingly, the gram-molecular weight was deﬁned as the weight
of the particle on a scale in which the weight of oxygen was 16 gram.4 Consequently,

the gram-molecular weights of all substances contain the same numbers of molecules.
Avogadro’s hypothesis was disregarded by chemists for almost 50 years until 1858 when
Stanislao Cannizzaro convinced the leading chemists of the truth of the hypothesis.
A major preoccupation was putting some order into the properties of the chemical
elements. In 1789, Lavoisier published a list of 33 chemical elements and grouped them
into gases, metals, non-metals and earths. The search was on for a more precise classiﬁcation
scheme. It was known that certain groups of elements had similar chemical properties –
for example, the alkali metals sodium, potassium and rubidium and the halogens, chlorine,
bromine and iodine. Dmitri Mendeleyev in 1869 and Julius Meyer in 1870 independently
published what became known as the periodic table of the elements. The tables were
constructed by listing the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and then starting a
new column when similar classes of elements appeared (Fig. 1.2). Mendeleyev left gaps in
the table if an appropriate element had not yet been discovered and then used the trends to
predict the properties of the missing elements. Examples included scandium, gallium and
germanium. On occasion, he altered the order by atomic weight in order to match similar
elements in different rows.

elements inserted so that similar elements would lie along the same row.
The process of ﬁlling in the elements in the periodic table continued throughout the
nineteenth century. The understanding of the physics of the atoms of different elements
was to be a major concern of Niels Bohr as he struggled to incorporate them into the old
quantum theory in the early 1920s. The chemists did not really need the atomic hypothesis
to make progress, but rather the empirical rules described above were sufﬁcient to enable
remarkable progress to be made in the understanding of chemical processes. As the interest
of the chemists waned, however, the physicists took up the reins with the need to provide a
microscopic interpretation of the laws of thermodynamics.
1.3 The kinetic theory of gases and
Boltzmann’s statistical mechanics
The discovery of the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics in the early 1850s placed
thermodynamics on a ﬁrm theoretical foundation and these laws were to be elucidated
by the next generation of theoretical physicists. Among the challenges was the physical

1.3 The kinetic theory of gases
interpretation of the law of increase of entropy which exercised the greatest minds of the
subsequent period, including Clausius, Maxwell, Boltzmann and Planck.
1.3.1 The kinetic theory of gases
The laws of thermodynamics describe the properties of matter in bulk. In fact, the theory
denies that there is any microscopic structure, its great merit being that it provides general
relations between the macroscopic properties of material systems. Nonetheless, Clausius
and Maxwell had no hesitation in developing the kinetic theory of gases, considering them
to consist of vast numbers of particles making continuous elastic collisions with each other
and the walls of the containing vessel. Clausius provided the ﬁrst systematic account of
the theory in 1857 in his paper entitled On the nature of the motion, which we call heat
(Clausius, 1857). He succeeded in deriving the equation of state of a monatomic gas by
working in terms of the mean velocities of the particles. Whilst accounting for the perfect
gas law admirably, it did not give good agreement with the known values of the ratios of their
speciﬁc heat capacities, γ = C p/CV for molecular gases, where C p and CV are the speciﬁc
heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume respectively. From experiment, γ
was found to be 1.4 for molecular gases, whereas the kinetic theory predicted γ = 1.67.
In the last sentence of his paper, Clausius recognised the important point that there must
therefore exist other means of storing kinetic energy within molecular gases which can
increase their internal energy per molecule.
One feature of Clausius’s work was of particular signiﬁcance for Maxwell. From the
kinetic theory, Clausius worked out the mean velocities of air molecules from his formula
RT = 1
3 N Mu2. For oxygen and nitrogen, he deduced velocities of 461 and 492 m s−1
respectively. The Dutch meteorologist Christoph Buys Ballot criticised this aspect of the
theory, since it is well known that pungent odours take minutes to permeate a room.
Clausius’s response was that the air molecules collide with each other and therefore diffuse
from one part of a volume to another, rather than propagate in straight lines. In his paper,
Clausius introduced the concept of the mean free path of the atoms and molecules of gases
for the ﬁrst time (Clausius, 1858). Thus, in the kinetic theory of gases, it must be supposed
that there are continually collisions between the molecules.
Both papers by Clausius were known to Maxwell when he turned to the problem of the
kinetic theory of gases in 1859 and 1860. His work was published in 1860 in a character-
istically novel and profound series of papers entitled Illustrations of the dynamical theory
of gases (Maxwell, 1860a,b,c). In a few brief paragraphs,5 he derived the formula for the
velocity distribution f (u) of the particles of the gas and introduced statistical concepts into
the kinetic theory of gases and thermodynamics,
f (u) du = 4π

(1.1)
Maxwell immediately noted
‘that the velocities are distributed among the particles according to the same law as the
errors are distributed among the observations in the theory of the method of least squares.’

Physics and theoretical physics in 1895
Francis Everitt has written that this derivation of Maxwell’s velocity distribution marks the
beginning of a new epoch in physics (Everitt, 1975). The statistical nature of the laws of
thermodynamics and the modern theory of statistical mechanics follow directly from his
analysis.
Maxwell, however, ran up against exactly the same problem as Clausius. If only the
translational degrees of freedom are taken into account, the value of γ should be 1.67.
Maxwell also considered the case in which the rotational degrees of freedom of non-
spherical molecules were taken into account as well as their translational motions, but this
calculation resulted in a ratio of speciﬁc heat capacities γ = 1.33, again inconsistent with
the value 1.4 observed in the common molecular gases. In the last sentence of his great
paper, he makes the discouraging remark:
‘Finally, by establishing a necessary relation between the motions of translation and
rotation of all particles not spherical, we proved that a system of such particles could not
possibly satisfy the known relation between the two speciﬁc heats of all gases.’
1.3.2 The viscosity of gases
Despite this difﬁculty, Maxwell immediately applied the kinetic theory of gases to their
transport properties – diffusion, thermal conductivity and viscosity. His calculation of the
coefﬁcient of viscosity of gases was of special importance.6 Speciﬁcally, he worked out
how the coefﬁcient of dynamic or absolute viscosity η is expected to change with pressure
and temperature. He found the result
η = 1
3λunm = 1
3
mu
σ ,
(1.2)
where λ is the mean free path of the molecules, u is their mean velocity, n their number
density and σ the collision cross-section of the molecules – λ and σ are related by λ = 1/nσ.
Maxwell was surprised to ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient of viscosity is independent of the pressure,
since there is no dependence upon number density n in (1.2). The reason is that, although
there are fewer molecules per unit volume as n decreases, the mean free path increases as
n−1, enabling the increment of momentum transfer to take place over greater distances.
Furthermore, as the temperature of the gas increases, u increases as T 1/2. Therefore, the
viscosity of a gas should increase with temperature, unlike the behaviour of liquids. This
somewhat counter-intuitive result was the subject of a brilliant set of experiments carried
out by Maxwell from 1863 to 1865 (Fig. 1.3). He conﬁrmed the prediction of the kinetic
theory that the viscosity of gases is independent of the pressure. He expected to discover
the T 1/2 law as well, but in fact found a stronger dependence, η ∝T .
In his great paper of 1867, he interpreted this result as indicating that there must be
a repulsive force between the molecules which varied with distance r as r−5. This was
a profound discovery since it meant that there was no longer any need to consider the
molecules to be ‘elastic spheres of deﬁnite radius’ (Maxwell, 1867). The repulsive force,

balance. The oscillations of the torsion balance were measured by reflecting a light beam from the mirror attached to

proportional to r−5, meant that encounters between molecules would take the form of
deﬂections through different angles, depending upon the impact parameter. Maxwell showed
that it was more appropriate to think in terms of a relaxation time, roughly the time it would
take a molecule to be deﬂected through 90◦, as a result of random encounters with other
molecules. According to Maxwell’s analysis, molecules could be replaced by centres of
repulsion, or, in his words, ‘mere points, or pure centres of force endowed with inertia’ – it
was no longer necessary to make any special assumption about molecules as hard, elastic
spheres. To express this insight more provocatively, the concept of collisions between
particles was replaced by interactions between ﬁelds of force.

1.3.3 The kinetic theory of gases and the law of increase of entropy
Another problem concerned the origins of the spectral lines observed in atomic and molec-
ular spectra. If these were associated with internal resonances within molecules, then
presumably these provided further means by which energy could be stored in the gas ac-
cording to the principle of the equipartition of energy, which awards an average of 1
2kT of
energy to each degree of freedom in equilibrium. Consequently, the number of degrees of
freedom N per molecule would increase and the ratio of speciﬁc heat capacities,
γ = C p
CV
=

2 NkT + kT

,
(1.3)
would tend to unity. The fact that the kinetic theory, and speciﬁcally the equipartition
theorem, could not satisfactorily account for all the properties of gases was a major barrier
to the acceptance of the kinetic theory. Furthermore, there was no direct experimental
evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules.
The status of atomic and molecular theories of the structure of matter came under attack
from a small number of prominent physicists, including Ernst Mach, Wilhelm Ostwald,
Pierre Duhem and Georg Helm who rejected the approach of interpreting the laws of
macroscopic physics at the microscopic level. Their approach was based on the concept of
‘energetics’, in which only energy considerations were invoked in understanding physical
phenomena, in clear conﬂict with those who favoured atomic and molecular theories. Most
late nineteenth century physicists were, however, of the view that, although the details were
not quite right, the atomic and molecular hypothesis was indeed the way ahead.
In 1867, Maxwell ﬁrst presented his famous argument by which he demonstrated how it
is possible to transfer heat from a colder to a hotter body on the basis of the kinetic theory of
gases, in violation of the strict application of the law of increase of entropy (Maxwell, 1867).
This argument is commonly referred to as involving ‘Maxwell’s demon’.7 The Maxwell
velocity distribution describes the range of velocities which inevitably must be present in a
gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature T . He considered a vessel divided into two halves,
A and B, the gas in A being hotter than that in B with a small hole drilled in the partition
between them. Whenever a fast molecule moves from B to A, heat is transferred from the
colder to the hotter body without the inﬂuence of any external agency. It is overwhelmingly
more likely that hot molecules move from A to B and in this process heat ﬂows from
the hotter to the colder body with the consequence that the entropy of the whole system
increases. According to the kinetic theory of gases, however, there is a very small but ﬁnite
probability that the reverse will happen spontaneously and entropy will decrease in this
natural process.
In the late 1860s, Clausius and Boltzmann attempted to derive the second law of ther-
modynamics from mechanics, an approach known as the dynamical interpretation of the
second law. The dynamics of individual particles were followed in the hope that they would
ultimately lead to an understanding of the origin of the second law. Maxwell rejected this
approach as a matter of principle because of the simple but compelling argument that
Newton’s laws of motion and Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld are time

1.4 Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic field
reversible and consequently the irreversibility implicit in the second law cannot be ex-
plained by a dynamical theory. The second law could only be understood as a statement
about the statistical behaviour of an immense number of particles.
Eventually, Boltzmann accepted Maxwell’s doctrine concerning the statistical nature of
the second law and set about working out the formal relationship between entropy and
probability,
S = k ln p ,
(1.4)
where S is the entropy, p the probability of that state and k is a universal constant. In
his analysis, the value of the constant k, Boltzmann’s constant, was not known. Boltz-
mann’s analysis is of considerable mathematical complexity and, indeed, this was one of
the problems which stood in the way of the scientists of his day fully appreciating the deep
signiﬁcance of what he had achieved. Among those who did was Josiah Willard Gibbs
who, in his fundamental text Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics, demonstrated
that systems of huge numbers of particles did indeed tend to thermodynamic equilibrium,
although there were necessarily ﬂuctuations about the average properties of the gas at every
stage of the evolution towards equilibrium (Gibbs, 1902).
1.4 Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic field
One of the unquestioned triumphs of nineteenth century physics was Maxwell’s discovery
of the equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld.8 Building on the brilliant experimental in-
vestigations of Michael Faraday, Maxwell discovered the equations for the electromagnetic
ﬁeld:9
curl E = −∂B
∂t ,
(1.5)
curl H = J + ∂D
∂t ,
(1.6)
div D = ρe ,
(1.7)
div B = 0 .
(1.8)
In this modern notation, D and B are the electric and magnetic ﬂux densities, E and
H are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths and J is the current density. The term
∂D/∂t is the famous displacement current, originally introduced on the basis of Maxwell’s
mechanical model for material media, or vacua (Maxwell, 1861a,b, 1862a,b). All mention
of the mechanical origins of his model disappears from the ﬁnal version of the theory in
his great paper A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (Maxwell, 1865).
Maxwell’s was only one of a number of theories of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and it took
some time before the full validation of his theory came about. The remarkable result of
Maxwell’s calculations was that the speed of light in a vacuum depended only upon the
fundamental constants of electrostatics ϵ0, the permittivity of free space, and magnetostatics
μ0, the permeability of free space, through the relation c = (ϵ0μ0)−1/2. The determination

of these quantities by laboratory experiments was a major concern of Maxwell and his
successor as Cavendish Professor, John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh.
The ﬁnal validation of the equations was obtained through the brilliant experiments of
Hertz in the period 1887–1889, almost a decade after Maxwell’s death (Hertz, 1893). Hertz
demonstrated that electromagnetic disturbances are propagated at the speed of light in free
space (Fig. 1.4). In addition, these waves behaved in all respects exactly like light, the
subject headings of his great book being rectilinear propagation, polarisation, reﬂection,
and refraction. This was the ﬁnal proof of the validity of Maxwell’s equations. Ironically, in
the same experiments which provided conﬁrmation of Maxwell’s theory, Hertz discovered
the photoelectric effect, the liberation of cathode rays by ultraviolet and optical radiation,
which was to prove to be evidence for the fact that, in some circumstances, radiation behaves
like particles.
Maxwell resigned from his post at King’s College London in 1865 in order to look after
the family estate at Glenlair in the Scottish borders and to continue his studies into his
many areas of scientiﬁc interest. During the succeeding years, he put an enormous effort
into the writing of his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (Maxwell, 1873). The Treatise
is unlike many of the other great texts such as Newton’s Principia Mathematica in that it
is not a systematic presentation of the subject but a work in progress, reﬂecting Maxwell’s
extensive approach to research. In a later conversation, Maxwell remarked that the aim of
the Treatise was not to expound his theory ﬁnally to the world, but to educate himself by
presenting a view of the stage he had reached. Maxwell’s somewhat disconcerting advice
was to read the four parts of the Treatise in parallel rather than in sequence.

1.5 The Michelson–Morley experiment
One of the most important results appears for the ﬁrst time in Part 4, Sect. 792 of
Volume 2 in which Maxwell worked out the pressure which radiation exerts on a conductor.
This profound result provides the relation between the pressure p and the energy density
ε of a ‘gas’ of electromagnetic radiation p = 1
3ε, derived entirely from Maxwell’s electro-
magnetic theory.10 This key result was used by Boltzmann in his paper of 1884 in which
he derived the Stefan–Boltzmann law from classical thermodynamics (Sect. 1.7.1).
But more than experimental validation of the equations was needed. A new and different
perspective had to be adopted to reveal the full power of Maxwell’s equations for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. As Freeman Dyson has written,
‘Maxwell’s theory had to wait for the next generation of physicists, Hertz and Lorentz and
Einstein, to reveal its power and clarify its concepts. The next generation grew up with
Maxwell’s equations and was at home with a Universe built out of ﬁelds. The primacy
of ﬁelds was as natural to Einstein as the primacy of mechanical structures had been for
Maxwell.’ (Dyson, 1999)
1.5 The Michelson–Morley experiment and the theory of relativity
The uniﬁcation of light and electromagnetism encouraged experimental physicists to ﬁnd
evidence for the medium through which electromagnetic phenomena are propagated, the
aether. The most famous experiment was the pioneering interferometric measurements of
Michelson (Fig. 1.5a). The ﬁnal result published by Michelson and Edward Morley (1887)
showed no evidence for the drift of the aether relative to the arms of the interferometer, the
level of signiﬁcance of this famous null result being quite enormous (Fig. 1.5b).
One of the concerns about Maxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld was that the
forms of the equations are not invariant with respect to the Galilean transformations of
Newtonian physics. For this reason, Maxwell’s equations were regarded as being ‘non-
relativistic’ – the equations would only hold good in a single preferred frame of reference
and in all others there would be additional terms.11 Woldmar Voigt (1887) was aware
of the null result of Michelson’s experiments and in 1887 published an analysis of the
transformations between inertial frames of reference with the assumption that the speed
of propagation of the waves was the same in all inertial frames. To express his insight in
different terms, he was the ﬁrst physicist to work out the set of transformations which would
leave the wave equation form invariant. He found the following transformations:

attention was paid to his analysis.12 Voigt showed that these transformations reduce to the
standard expression for the Doppler shift in the limit V ≪c.
Explanations of the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment were proposed
independently by Fitzgerald and Hendrik Lorentz. In his brief note of 1889, Fitzgerald
suggested that a contraction of the length of the arm of the interferometer by a factor
γ = (1 −V 2/c2)−1/2 in the direction of motion through the aether could account for the
null result (Fitzgerald, 1889). Lorentz had agonised about the null result of the Michelson–
Morley experiment and came to the same conclusion that it could be explained by a physical
contraction of dimensions in the direction of motion of the apparatus through the aether
(Lorentz, 1892a). Over the succeeding decade, he built the Fitzgerald–Lorentz contraction
into his theory of the electron. One of the suggestive results of the electrodynamics of
moving charges was that, according to Maxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the
ﬁeld lines would be squashed perpendicular to the direction of motion13 by the same factor
γ . Eventually in 1904 Lorentz arrived at the complete expressions for the Lorentz trans-
formations by a somewhat tortuous route14 (Lorentz, 1904), in stark contrast to the much
deeper and simpler approach of Einstein in his great paper of 1905, On the electrodynamics
of moving bodies (Einstein, 1905c). The Lorentz transformations established by Lorentz

1.6 The origin of spectral lines
The ﬁrst decades of the nineteenth century marked the beginnings of quantitative exper-
imental spectroscopy. The breakthrough resulted from the pioneering experiments and
theoretical understanding of the laws of interference and diffraction of waves by Thomas
Young. In his Bakerian Lecture of 1801 to the Royal Society of London, On the theory of
light and colours, he used the wave theory of light of Christiaan Huygens to account for
the results of interference experiments, such as his famous double-slit experiment (Young,
1802). Among the most striking achievements of this paper was the measurement of the
wavelengths of light of different colours using a diffraction grating with 500 grooves per
inch. From this time onwards, wavelengths were used to characterise the colours in the
spectrum.
In 1802, William Wollaston made spectroscopic observations of sunlight and discovered
ﬁve strong dark lines, as well as two fainter lines in the spectrum (Wollaston, 1802). The
full signiﬁcance of these observations only became apparent following the remarkable
experiments of Joseph Fraunhofer. Fraunhofer’s motivation for studying the solar spectrum
was his realisation that accurate measurements of the refractive indices of glasses should
be made using monochromatic light. In his spectroscopic observations of the Sun, he
rediscovered the narrow dark lines which would provide precisely deﬁned wavelength
standards. In his words,
‘I wanted to ﬁnd out whether in the colour-image (that is, spectrum) of sunlight, a similar
bright stripe was to be seen, as in the colour-image of lamplight. But instead of this, I
found with the telescope almost countless strong and weak vertical lines, which however
are darker than the remaining part of the colour-image; some seem to be completely
black.’

regions of the spectrum are labelled, as well as the letters A, a, B, C, D, E, b, F, G and H, indicating the most prominent
absorption lines. The continuous line above the spectrum shows the approximate solar continuum intensity, as
estimated by Fraunhofer (Fraunhofer, 1817a,b).
He labelled the 10 strongest lines in the solar spectrum A, a, B, C, D, E, b, F, G and H
and recorded 574 fainter lines between the B and H lines (Fig. 1.6) (Fraunhofer, 1817a,b),
the notation still used today. From the technical point of view, a major advance was the
invention of the spectroscope with which the deﬂection of light passing through the prism
could be measured precisely. To achieve this, he placed a theodolite on its side and observed
the spectrum through a telescope mounted on the rotating ring.
The understanding of the dark lines in the solar spectrum had to await developments
in laboratory spectroscopy. In his papers of 1817, Fraunhofer noted that the dark D lines
coincided with the bright double line seen in lamplight. In 1849, L´eon Foucault performed
a key experiment in which sunlight was passed through a sodium arc so that the two spectra
could be compared precisely. To his surprise, the solar spectrum displayed even darker
D lines when passed though the arc than without the arc present (Foucault, 1849). He
followed up this observation with an experiment in which the continuum spectrum of light
from glowing charcoal was passed through the arc and the dark D lines of sodium were
found to be imprinted on the transmitted spectrum.
Ten years later, the experiment was repeated by Gustav Kirchhoff who made the further
crucial observation that, to observe an absorption feature, the source of the light had to
be hotter than the absorbing ﬂame. These results were immediately followed up in 1859
by his understanding of the relation between the emissive and absorptive properties of any
substance, what is now known as Kirchhoff’s law of emission and absorption of radiation
(Kirchhoff, 1859).15 This states that, in thermal equilibrium, the radiant energy emitted
by a body at any frequency is precisely equal to the radiant energy absorbed at the same
wavelength. Speciﬁcally, for isotropic radiation, the monochromatic emission coefﬁcient jν
is deﬁned such that the increment in intensity dIν radiated into the solid angle d from the
cylindrical volume dV of area dA and length dl is
dIν dA d = jν dV d ,

1.6 The origin of spectral lines
where jν has units W m−3 Hz−1 sr−1. Since the emission is assumed to be isotropic, the
volume emissivity of the medium is εν = 4π jν. We can write the volume of the cylinder
dV = dA dl and so
dIν = jν dl .
(1.13)
The monochromatic absorption coefﬁcient αν is deﬁned by the relation
dIν dA d = −αν Iν dA d dl .
(1.14)
Kirchhoff showed that in thermodynamic equilibrium
αν Bν(T ) = jν .
(1.15)
In other words, the emission and absorption coefﬁcients for any physical process are
related by the unknown spectrum of equilibrium radiation Bν(T ). This expression enabled
Kirchhoff to understand the relation between the emission and absorption properties of
ﬂames, arcs, sparks and the solar atmosphere. In 1859, very little was known about the
form of Bν(T ). As Kirchhoff remarked,
‘It is a highly important task to ﬁnd this function.’
This was one of the great experimental challenges for the remaining decades of the nine-
teenth century. Kirchhoff’s profound insight was the beginning of a long and tortuous story
which was to lead to Planck’s discovery of the formula for black-body radiation over 40
years later.
Throughout the 1850s, there was considerable effort in Europe and in the USA aimed
at identifying the emission and absorption lines produced by different substances in ﬂame,
spark and arc spectra. Different elements and compounds possessed distinctive patterns
of spectral lines and attempts were made to relate these to the lines observed in the
solar spectrum. In 1859, for example, Julius Pl¨ucker identiﬁed the Fraunhofer F line with
the bright Hβ line of hydrogen and the C line was more or less coincident with Hα,
demonstrating the presence of hydrogen in the solar atmosphere.
The most important work resulted from the studies of Robert Bunsen and Kirchhoff. In
Kirchhoff’s great papers of 1861–1863 entitled Investigations of the solar spectrum and the
spectra of the chemical elements, the solar spectrum was compared with the spark spectra
of 30 elements using a four-prism arrangement with which it was possible to view both the
spectrum of the element and the solar spectrum simultaneously (Kirchhoff, 1861, 1862,
1863). Kirchhoff concluded that the cool, outer regions of the solar atmosphere contained
iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, nickel and chromium and probably cobalt, barium,
copper and zinc as well.
While the patterns of spectral lines provided the ﬁngerprints for the presence of different
elements in stars, a major challenge was to discover formulae which could describe the
wavelengths of the lines in the spectra of different elements. The ﬁrst and most impor-
tant success was the spectrum of hydrogen. In his remarkable papers of 1885, the Swiss
schoolmaster Johann Jakob Balmer used laboratory and astronomical spectra to describe

where m = 3, 4, 5, . . . and λ0 = 3645 ˚A. The constant λ0 corresponds to the wavelength

(1.17)
where R∞is known as the Rydberg constant. With the aid of subsequent astronomical ob-
servations, Balmer was able to test his formula up to m = 16 and found precise agreement
with (1.16) (Balmer, 1885).16 This was the ﬁrst quantum mechanical formula to be dis-
covered. Balmer died 15 years before the deep signiﬁcance of his numerological discovery
was appreciated by Niels Bohr. A similar regularity appeared in Pickering’s observation
of 1896 of the star ζ Puppis. He discovered a sequence of absorption lines resembling the
Balmer series, which became known as the Pickering series (Pickering, 1896). He showed
that the lines could be described by Balmer’s formula provided half-integral values of the
principal quantum number m were used.
Of the numerous formulae proposed to describe the lines in the spectra of different
elements, two are of special signiﬁcance. In 1889, Johannes Rydberg presented a memoir
to the Royal Swedish Academy in which he proposed that the spectral lines of all series in
atomic spectra could be described by the formula
n = n0 −
R∞
(m + μ)2 ,
(1.18)
where m is a positive integer and R∞, the same Rydberg constant introduced in (1.17), was
to be a constant for all series. The empirical constant μ is known as the quantum defect. The
spectroscopists had found various regularities in the spectra of the elements, the strongest
lines forming the principal series, while other regularities were found for broader lines
which were known as the diffuse series and a sharp series of lines which were so named.
For each series of each element, n0 and μ were estimated from the experimentally measured
wavelengths, the quantum defect μ lying in the range 0 < μ < 1. If μ = 0, the formula
reduces to Balmer’s formula. The formula was applied successfully to the principal, diffuse
and sharp series of the lines in the spectra of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and
zinc. This formula was later generalised to the following forms for the different series:
Principal series

where m = 3, 4, 5, . . . and the constants s, p and d are chosen to ﬁt the observed spectra
for each series.
In 1908, these formulae were generalised further by Walther Ritz (1908) who formulated
his combination principle according to which every spectral line could be expressed as the

1.7 The spectrum of black-body radiation
difference of two so-called spectral terms, each of which depended upon an integer m as
well as the constants appearing in (1.19)–(1.21). Thus, Ritz wrote:
ν = (2, p, π) −(m, s, σ) ,
(1.22)
where the terms in brackets are generalisations of the terms in (1.18). The inference is that
the spectral lines of any element include frequencies that are either the sum or the difference
of the frequencies of two other lines. Thus, if the individual terms in the Ritz formula are A,
B and C and the observed lines are (A −B) and (B −C), by adding the frequencies we ﬁnd
(A −B) + (B −C) = (A −C) and by subtracting them (A −B) −(A −C) = (C −B).
This proved to be a powerful tool for disentangling complex spectra of elements into their
different constituent series. But, even more importantly, Ritz’s combination principle was
to prove to lie at the very heart of the revolution which was to lead to the reformulation of
the laws of physics at the atomic level (Sect. 11.3).
1.7 The spectrum of black-body radiation
Kirchhoff’s exhortation about the central importance of determining the equilibrium dis-
tribution of radiation B(T ) stimulated theoretical and experimental physicists to take up
the challenge. The function B(T ) is known as the black-body spectrum because it is the
equilibrium spectrum of a perfect radiator and absorber in thermal equilibrium. The next
task is to understand the preliminaries which were to lead to Planck’s epochal discovery
in 1900. The ﬁrst steps involved determining the total amount of radiation emitted by a
black-body, the Stefan–Boltzmann law.
1.7.1 The derivation of the Stefan–Boltzmann law
Josef Stefan deduced the law which bears his name empirically from experimental data
published by Tyndall in 1865 on the radiation of a platinum strip heated electrically to
different temperatures. In 1879, he published a paper in which he stated:
‘From weak red heat (about 525 C) to complete white heat (about 1200 C) the intensity of
radiation increases from 10.4 to 122, thus nearly twelvefold (more precisely 11.7). This
observation caused me to take the heat radiation as proportional to the fourth power of
the absolute temperature. The ratio of the absolute temperature 273 + 1200 and 273 +
525 raised to the fourth power gives 11.6.’ (Stefan, 1879)
This relation refers to the total radiation emitted by the heated body,
−

= total radiant energy per second ∝T 4 .
(1.23)
In 1884, Boltzmann, Stefan’s pupil, deduced this law theoretically from considerations of
classical thermodynamics (Boltzmann, 1884). Suppose a closed volume is ﬁlled only with
electromagnetic radiation and that it contains a piston so that the ‘gas’ of radiation can be

compressed or expanded. If the heat dQ is added to the system, the total internal energy is
increased by dU and work is done on the piston as it is pushed outwards slightly so that the
volume increases by dV . By conservation of energy,
dQ = dU + p dV .
(1.24)
Now rearrange this relation by introducing the associated increase in entropy dS = dQ/T :
T dS = dU + p dV .
(1.25)
This relation is converted into a partial differential equation by dividing through by dV at
constant T

(1.27)
Thus, if we know the relation between U and T , that is, the equation of state for the gas,
the relation between temperature and energy density can be found. This relation for a ‘gas’
of electromagnetic radiation was derived by Maxwell in his Treatise on Electricity and
Magnetism, p = 1
3ε, where ε is the energy density of radiation (see Sect. 1.4).
Therefore, U = εV and p = 1

(1.28)
This is Boltzmann’s contribution to the Stefan–Boltzmann law. In modern form, the law
is written I = σ T 4, where I is the radiant energy emitted per unit area per second from
the surface of a black-body at temperature T . The experimental evidence for the Stefan–
Boltzmann law was not particularly convincing in 1884 and it was not until 1897 that
Lummer and Pringsheim undertook their very careful experiments which showed that the
law was indeed correct with high precision.
1.7.2 Wien’s displacement law and the spectrum of black-body radiation
The spectrum of black-body radiation was poorly known until the turn of the century
but there had already been some important work done on the theoretical form which the
radiation law should have. In 1894, Wilhelm (Willy) Wien published his derivation of his

1.7 The spectrum of black-body radiation
displacement law by a combination of electromagnetism and thermodynamics and this
was to prove to be of central importance in the development of the theory of black-body
radiation (Wien, 1894).
First, consider the adiabatic expansion of a ‘gas’ of electromagnetic radiation. The ﬂow
of heat in or out of the system dQ = dU + p dV and in an adiabatic expansion, dQ = 0.
Further, since U = εV and p = 1

d(εV ) + 1
3ε dV = 0;
V dε + ε dV + 1
3ε dV ;

V .
(1.29)
Integrating,
ε = constant × V −4/3 .
(1.30)
But ε = aT 4 where a = 4σ/c and hence
T V 1/3 = constant .
(1.31)
Since V is proportional to the cube of the dimension of a spherical volume, V ∝r3 and so
T ∝r−1.
The next step is to work out the relation between the wavelength of the radiation and
the volume of the enclosure. This is no more than the Doppler shift formula for radiation
enclosed within the expanding volume V , λ ∝r, that is, the wavelength of the radiation
increases linearly proportionally to the size of the spherical volume.18 We now combine
this result with the relation T ∝r−1 to ﬁnd
T ∝λ−1 .
(1.32)
This is one aspect of Wien’s displacement law. If radiation is adiabatically expanded, the
wavelength of radiation changes inversely with temperature if we follow a particular set
of waves. In other words, the wavelength of the radiation is ‘displaced’ as the temperature
changes. In particular, if we follow the maximum of the radiation spectrum it should follow
the T −1 law. This was found to be in agreement with experiment.
Wien now went further and combined the Stefan–Boltzmann law with the law T ∝λ−1
to set constraints on what the spectral form of the radiation had to be. My own version of
the argument is as follows. The ﬁrst step is to note that if any system of bodies is enclosed
in a perfectly reﬂecting enclosure, eventually they will all come to the same temperature
because of the emission and absorption of radiation. At the microscopic level, the system
comes into thermal equilibrium, whatever the properties of the walls, as a result of the
principle of detailed balance. The radiation comes into equilibrium with the objects in
the enclosure so that as much energy is radiated as absorbed by the bodies per unit time
and the equilibrium spectrum is a black-body spectrum. The radiation will be isotropic and
so the only parameters which can characterise the radiation are the temperature T of the
enclosure and the wavelength of the radiation λ.
If the black-body radiation is initially at temperature T1 and the enclosure is expanded
adiabatically, then since an adiabatic expansion takes place inﬁnitely slowly, the radiation
takes up an equilibrium spectrum at all stages in the expansion until it reaches temper-
ature T2. The crucial point is that, in an adiabatic expansion, the radiation spectrum has

black-body form at all stages in the expansion from T1 to T2. The unknown law for the
radiation spectrum must therefore scale appropriately with temperature.
Consider the radiation in the wavelength interval λ1 to λ1 + dλ1, and let its energy density
be ε = u(λ1) dλ1. Then, in the expansion, according to Boltzmann’s analysis, the energy
associated with the radiation of any particular set of waves decreases as T 4 and hence

.
(1.33)
But λ1T1 = λ2T2 and hence dλ1 = (T2/T1) dλ2. Therefore,

,
(1.34)
that is,
u(λ)
T 5 = constant ,
(1.35)
and, since λT = constant, this can be rewritten as
u(λ)λ5 = constant .
(1.36)
Notice that u(λ) is the energy density per unit wavelength interval in the radiation spectrum.
Now the only combination of T and λ which is a constant is the product λT and hence
we can write that, in general, the constant on the right-hand side of (1.36) can only be
constructed out of functions involving λT . Therefore the radiation law must have the form
u(λ)λ5 = f (λT ) ,
(1.37)
or
u(λ) dλ = λ−5 f (λT ) dλ .
(1.38)
This is Wien’s displacement law in its entirety and it sets constraints on the form of the
radiation law for black-body radiation. In terms of frequency, the relation can be written
u(λ) dλ = u(ν) dν;
λ = c/ν,

This brilliant argument shows how far Wien was able to get using only rather general
thermodynamic arguments. This work was new in 1894 when Planck ﬁrst became interested

1.8 The gathering storm
1.8 The gathering storm
The triumphs of nineteenth century physics were hard-won and their full implications were
still being understood. To the thorny problems described in the sections of this chapter were
about to be added a whole new set of discoveries which were indeed to rock the foundations
of the subject. Most physicists clung to the hope that the challenges described in this chapter
would eventually be resolved within the context of classical physics, but even that hope was
to prove illusory. Physics was about to enter a period when the foundations were cut away
and it would be 30 years before the theory of quantum mechanics was discovered. Through
this period of uncertainty, some of the greatest minds in physics pitted themselves against
almost insuperable problems with courage and imagination.

Planck and black-body radiation
2.1 The key role of experimental technique
1895 was not an arbitrary choice as the cut-off year for the history recounted in Chap. 1. Over
the following years a number of experimental discoveries were made which were to change
dramatically the face of physics. The origins of these discoveries can be traced to the need for
increased precision in experimental physics. The industrial revolution and the widespread
availability of electricity and electrical communication required more exact understanding
of the physical properties of materials and also the establishment of international standards.
These necessitated a much more professional approach to the teaching of experimental
physics and its associated theory. As part of that movement the Clarendon Laboratory
was founded in Oxford in 1868 and the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge in 1874. Of
particular signiﬁcance for this chapter was the foundation of the Physikalisch-Technische
Reichsanstaldt in Berlin in 1887 with the task of providing precise measurements of the
physical properties of materials which would be of importance to industry. There was an
expectation that these laboratories would develop new techniques for undertaking precision
measurements.
New experimental techniques were developed thanks to the development of new tech-
nologies. To mention only a few of the more important of these, better vacuums were
available to physicists through the invention of the Geissler pump, invented by Johann
Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler, a brilliant inventor and glass-blower, in about 1855. The vac-
uum was produced by trapping air in a mercury column and forcing it down the column
by the force of gravity. Typically pressures of 0.1 mm of mercury could be obtained
within his vacuum tubes. Higher voltages could be placed across discharge tubes with the
invention of the R¨uhmkorff coil which consisted of a transformer with a small number
of windings on the primary and a very large number on the secondary. High precision
spectroscopy was revolutionised by the superb diffraction gratings produced by Henry
Rowland, who pioneered the construction of high precision ruling engines. Samuel Pier-
point Langley perfected the techniques of infrared spectrometry through the invention of
the platinum bolometer with which temperature changes as small as 10−4 K could be
measured. Although Langley’s interests were primarily astronomical, the techniques were
used to great advantage in the determination of the spectrum of black-body radiation
in the ﬁnal decade of the nineteenth century. The combination of these and many other
advances in technology and experimental technique were about to produce unexpected
fruits.

2.2 The changing landscape of experimental physics
2.2 1895–1900: The changing landscape of
experimental physics1
The vacuum tube was to play a central role in the discoveries of the 1890s. The basic
apparatus consisted of a thin-walled glass vacuum tube with positive and negative electrodes
between which a high voltage could be maintained. It was realised in the early nineteenth
century that gases are poor conductors of electricity since they are electrically neutral.
At very low pressures and high voltages, however, electrical discharges were observed in
vacuum tubes. Geissler tubes became popular scientiﬁc toys and revealed a remarkable range
of coloured discharges. William Crookes began his systematic studies of the conduction
of electricity through gases in 1879. The appearance of the discharge in the vacuum tube
changed as the pressure of the gas decreased. The colourful displays disappeared as the
pressure decreased but a current continued to ﬂow. At low enough pressures, the walls
of the tube glowed green due to phosphorescence. It was found that objects placed in
the tube cast a shadow on the walls of the tube opposite the cathode. It was inferred
that a stream of cathode rays must be dragged off the cathode causing the walls of the
tube to glow. By 1895, it was established that the cathode rays were negatively charged
particles which could be deﬂected by magnetic ﬁelds. In 1895 Jean-Baptiste Perrin collected
the cathode rays inside a vacuum tube and found directly that they had negative electric
charge.
2.2.1 The discovery of X-rays
In 1895, Wilhelm Conrad R¨ontgen discovered, by accident, that wrapped unexposed pho-
tographic plates left close to discharge tubes were darkened. In addition, if a discharge tube
were completely surrounded by thin black cardboard, ﬂuorescent materials left close to it
glowed in the dark. R¨ontgen came to the correct conclusion that both phenomena were
associated with some new form of radiation emitted by the discharge tube, and he named
these X-rays (R¨ontgen, 1895). His startling X-ray image of his wife’s hand, showing the
bones of the hand and her massive ring, had an immediate impact (Fig. 2.1a). Overnight,
X-rays became a matter of the greatest public interest and were very rapidly incorporated
into the armoury of the doctor’s surgery. In 1896, there were already more than 1000 ar-
ticles on X-rays. The X-rays were more penetrating than cathode rays, since they could
blacken photographic plates at a considerable distance from the hot spot on the discharge
tube, which was known to be their source. Their identiﬁcation with ‘ultra-ultraviolet’ ra-
diation was only convincingly demonstrated in 1906, when Charles Barkla found that the
X-radiation was polarised (Barkla, 1906) and in 1912, when Max von Laue had the inspi-
ration of looking for their diffraction by crystals (Friedrich et al., 1912; Laue, 1912), in the
process opening up the new ﬁeld of X-ray crystallography. Measurements of the interaction
of X-rays with matter was to prove to be a central tool in disentangling the structure of
atoms.

radioactive salt had not been exposed to sunlight.
2.2.2 The discovery of radioactivity
The association of X-rays with ﬂuorescent materials led to the search for other sources of
X-radiation. In 1896, Henri Becquerel, who came from a distinguished family of French
physicists, tested several known ﬂuorescent substances before investigating samples of
potassium uranyl disulphate. The photographic plates were wrapped in several sheets of
black paper, the phosphorescent material was exposed to sunlight and then the plate devel-
oped to ﬁnd if it had been darkened by X-rays. Becquerel’s remarkable discovery was that
the plates were darkened even when the phosphorescent material was not exposed to light
(Fig. 2.1b). This was the discovery of natural radioactivity (Becquerel, 1896). In further
experiments carried out in the same year, Becquerel showed that the amount of radioactivity
was proportional to the amount of uranium in the substance and that the radioactive ﬂux of
radiation was constant in time. Another important discovery was that the radiation from the
uranium compounds discharged electroscopes. Pierre Curie and Marie Skłodowska-Curie
repeated Becquerel’s experiments in 1897 and showed that the intensity of radioactivity was
proportional to the amount of uranium in different samples. Other radioactive substances
were soon identiﬁed. Thorium was discovered in 1898 (Schmidt, 1898). By concentrating
uranium residues, the Curies discovered the new element polonium, named after Marie’s
native land. The new element decreased in radioactivity exponentially – radioactive sub-
stances have a certain half-life. In September 1898, very strong radioactivity was found in
the barium group of residues. Sufﬁcient of the radioactive substance was isolated to show
that a new element had been discovered, radium (Curie and Skłodowska-Curie, 1898; Curie
et al., 1898).

2.2 The changing landscape of experimental physics
As soon as the discovery of radioactivity was announced, Ernest Rutherford took up
the study of radioactivity. In his ﬁrst publication on the subject, Rutherford established
that there are at least two separate types of radiation emitted by radioactive substances
(Rutherford, 1899). He called the component which is most easily absorbed α-radiation (or
α-rays) and the much more penetrating component β-radiation (or β-rays). It took another
10 years before Rutherford conclusively demonstrated that the α-radiation consisted of
the nuclei of helium atoms (Rutherford and Royds, 1909). In contrast, the β-rays were
convincingly shown by Walter Kaufmann to have the same mass-to-charge ratio as the re-
cently discovered electron (Kaufmann, 1902). γ -radiation was discovered in 1900 by Paul
Villard as an extremely penetrating form of radiation emitted in radioactive decays – the
γ -rays were undeﬂected by a magnetic ﬁeld (Villard, 1900a,b). The γ -rays were conclusively
identiﬁed as electromagnetic waves 14 years later when Rutherford and Edward Andrade
observed the reﬂection of γ -rays from crystal surfaces (Rutherford and Andrade, 1913).
The α-, β- and γ -rays were the only known radiations which could cause the ionisation
of air. The characteristic property which distinguished them was their penetrating power.
In quantitative terms, these were:
r The α-particles ejected in radioactive decays produce a dense stream of ions and are
stopped in air within about 0.05 m. This is called the range of the particles.
r The β-particles have greater ranges, but there is not a well-deﬁned value for any particular
radioactive decay.
r The γ -rays were found to have by far the longest ranges, a few centimetres of lead being
necessary to reduce their intensity by a factor of 10.
2.2.3 The discovery of the electron
With R¨ontgen’s announcement of the discovery of X-rays, John Joseph (JJ) Thomson im-
mediately directed his research efforts to the study of electrical discharges in gases. Exper-
imenting with cathode rays was difﬁcult in Thomson’s time because a very good vacuum
was required. Otherwise, the cathode rays collided with air molecules, ionising the gas
and making it a conductor which shielded the rays. Thomson recognised the necessity of
extremely low pressures. He and his assistant Ebeneezar Everett, who built all his apparatus
and carried out the experiments, took great pains to secure excellent vacua and to eliminate
the effects of outgassing from the materials of the tube (Fig. 2.2).
The discovery of the electron in 1897 is traditionally attributed to Thomson on the basis
of his famous series of experiments, in which he established that the charge-to-mass ratio,
e/me, of cathode rays is about two-thousand times that of hydrogen ions. At the same time,
several physicists were hot on the trail.
r In 1896, Pieter Zeeman discovered the broadening of spectral lines when a sodium ﬂame
is placed between the poles of a strong electromagnet. Lorentz interpreted this result in
terms of the splitting of the spectral lines due to the motion of the ‘ions’ in the atoms
about the magnetic ﬁeld direction – he found a lower limit of 1000 for the value of e/me
of the‘ions’.

The vacuum tube with which J. J. Thomson measured the charge-to-mass ratio of cathode rays.
r In January 1897, Emil Wiechert used the magnetic deﬂection technique to obtain a
measurement of e/me for cathode rays and concluded that these particles had mass
between 2000 and 4000 times smaller than that of hydrogen, assuming their electric
charge was the same as that of hydrogen ions. He obtained only an upper limit to the
speed of the particles since it was assumed that the kinetic energy of the cathode rays
was Ekin = eV , where V is the accelerating voltage of the discharge tube.
r Walter Kaufmann’s experiment was similar to Thomson’s. He found the same values of
e/me, no matter which gas ﬁlled the discharge tube, a result which puzzled him. He found
a value of e/me 1000 times greater than that of hydrogen ions. He concluded
‘. . . that the hypothesis of cathode rays as emitted particles is by itself inadequate for a
satisfactory explanation of the regularities I have observed.’
Thomson was the ﬁrst of these pioneers to interpret the experiments in terms of a
sub-atomic particle. In his words, cathode rays constituted
‘. . . a new state, in which the subdivision of matter is carried very much further than in
the ordinary gaseous state.’ (Thomson, 1897)
Thomson further showed that the particles ejected in the photoelectric effect, discovered
by Hertz in 1887, were also identical with electrons. In 1898, Thomson modiﬁed one of
C. T. R. Wilson’s early cloud chambers to measure the charge of the electron. He counted
the total number of droplets formed and their total charge. From these, he estimated
e = 2.2 × 10−19 C, compared with the present standard value of 1.602 × 10−19 C. This
experiment was the precursor of the famous Millikan oil drop experiment, in which the
water-vapour droplets were replaced by ﬁne drops of a heavy oil, which did not evaporate
during the course of the experiment. Thus, Thomson pursued a more sustained and detailed
campaign than the other physicists in establishing the universality of what became known
as electrons, the name coined for cathode rays by Johnstone Stoney in 1891 (Stoney, 1891).

2.3 Planck and the spectrum of black-body radiation
2.3 Planck and the spectrum of black-body radiation
The discoveries in experimental physics summarised in the last section form the background
to Planck’s research into the nature of black-body radiation – these were the cutting-
edge areas of research which had uncovered a whole new range of phenomena which
required theoretical explanation. Up to 1894, Planck’s researches had been principally
into elucidating the nature of classical thermodynamics and the law of increase of entropy.
Following the death of Kirchhoff in 1889, he succeeded to Kirchhoff’s chair at the University
of Berlin. This was a propitious advance since Berlin was one of the most active centres of
physics research in the world.
In 1894, Planck turned his attention to the problem of the spectrum of black-body
radiation. It is likely that his interest in this problem was stimulated by Wien’s important
paper of that year, which was discussed in Sect. 1.7.2 (Wien, 1894). Wien’s analysis has a
strong thermodynamic ﬂavour, which must have appealed to Planck.
In 1895, Planck published the ﬁrst results of his work on the resonant scattering of
plane electromagnetic waves by an oscillating dipole. This was the ﬁrst of Planck’s papers
in which he diverged from his previous areas of interest in that it appeared to be about
electromagnetism rather than entropy. In the last words of the paper, however, Planck made
it clear that he regarded this as a ﬁrst step towards tackling the problem of the spectrum of
black-body radiation. His aim was to set up a system of oscillators in an enclosed cavity
which would radiate and interact with the radiation produced so that after a long time the
system would come into equilibrium. He could then apply the laws of thermodynamics to
black-body radiation with a view to understanding the origin of its spectrum. He explained
why this approach offered the prospect of providing insights into basic thermodynamic
processes. When energy is lost by an oscillator by radiation, it is not lost as heat, but
as electromagnetic waves. The process can be considered ‘conservative’ because, if the
radiation is enclosed in a box with perfectly reﬂecting walls, it can then react back on
the oscillator.2 Furthermore, the process is independent of the nature of the oscillator. In
Planck’s words,
‘The study of conservative damping seems to me to be of great importance, since it opens
up the prospect of a possible general explanation of irreversible processes by means
of conservative forces – a problem that confronts research in theoretical physics more
urgently every day.’3
Planck believed that, by studying classically the interaction of oscillators with electromag-
netic radiation, he would be able to show that entropy increases absolutely for a system
consisting of matter and radiation. These ideas, which were elaborated in a series of ﬁve
papers, did not work, as was pointed out by Boltzmann. One cannot obtain a monotonic
approach to equilibrium without some statistical assumptions about the way in which the
system approaches the equilibrium state. This can be understood from Maxwell’s simple but
compelling argument concerning the time reversibility of the laws of mechanics, dynamics
and electromagnetism.

Planck and black-body radiation
Finally, Planck conceded that statistical assumptions were necessary and introduced the
concept of ‘natural radiation’, which corresponded to Boltzmann’s assumption of ‘molec-
ular chaos’. Once the assumption was made that there exists a state of ‘natural radiation’,
Planck was able to make considerable progress with his programme. The ﬁrst thing he
did was to relate the energy density of radiation in an enclosure to the average energy
of the oscillators within it. This is a very important result and Planck derived it entirely
from classical arguments concerning the emission and absorption of radiation by a set of
oscillators.
Why did Planck treat oscillators rather than, say, atoms, molecules, lumps of rock, and so
on? The reason is that, in thermal equilibrium, everything is in equilibrium with everything
else – rocks are in equilibrium with atoms and oscillators and therefore there is no advantage
in treating complicated objects. The advantage of considering simple harmonic oscillators
is that the radiation and absorption laws can be calculated exactly. To express this important
point in another way, Kirchhoff’s law (1.15), which relates the emission and absorption
coefﬁcients, jν and αν respectively,
αν Bν(T ) = jν ,
shows that, if we can determine these coefﬁcients for any process, we can ﬁnd the universal
equilibrium spectrum Bν(T ).
I have given a detailed derivation of Planck’s relation between the mean energy of the
oscillator and the spectrum of radiation in thermal equilibrium with it in Chap. 12 of TCP2.
Here I summarise some of the key results and aspects of the analysis which will prove
important in later parts of the story.
2.3.1 The rate of radiation of an oscillator
Charged particles emit electromagnetic radiation when they are accelerated. The total rate
of loss of energy by an accelerated electron is
−
dE
dt

rad
=
| ¨p|2
6πϵ0c3 = e2|¨r|2
6πϵ0c3 ,
(2.1)
where p = e r is the dipole moment with respect to some origin and e the electric charge
of the electron – note that the radiation depends only upon the instantaneous acceleration
¨r of the electron. This result is often referred to as Larmor’s formula. The three essential
properties of the radiation of an accelerated charged particle are:
(a) The total radiation rate is given by Larmor’s formula (2.1) in which the acceleration is
the proper acceleration of the charged particle and the radiation loss rate is measured
in the instantaneous rest frame of the particle.
(b) The polar diagram of the radiation is of dipolar form, that is, the electric ﬁeld strength
varies as sin θ and the power radiated per unit solid angle varies as sin2 θ, where θ is
the angle with respect to the acceleration vector of the particle. There is no radiation
along the direction of the acceleration vector and the ﬁeld strength is greatest at right
angles to it.

2.3 Planck and the spectrum of black-body radiation
(c) The radiation is polarised with the electric ﬁeld vector lying in the direction of the
acceleration vector of the particle, as projected onto a sphere at distance r.
We now apply the result (2.1) to the case of an oscillator performing simple harmonic
oscillations with amplitude x0 at angular frequency ω0, x = |x0| exp(iωt). Therefore, ¨x =
−ω2
0|x0| exp(iωt), or, taking the real part, ¨x = −ω2
0|x0| cos ωt. The instantaneous rate of
loss of energy by radiation is therefore

The average value of cos2 ωt is 1

of electromagnetic radiation is
−
dE

0e2|x0|2
12πϵ0c3 .
(2.3)
As shown below, the energy E of the oscillator is E = 1
2m|x0|2ω2
0 and so
−dE
dt = γ E ,
(2.4)
where γ = ω2
0e2/6πϵ0c3m. This expression can be rewritten in terms of the classical elec-
tron radius re = e2/4πϵ0mec2. Thus γ = 2reω2
0/3c, where me is the mass of the electron.
2.3.2 Radiation damping of an oscillator
The equation of damped simple harmonic motion can be written in the form
m ¨x + a ˙x + kx = 0 ,
where m is the (reduced) mass, k the spring constant and a ˙x the damping force. The energies
associated with each of these terms is found by multiplying through by ˙x and integrating
with respect to time.

 t
0
d(˙x2) +
 t
0
a ˙x2 dt + 1
2k

d(x2) = 0 .
(2.5)
We identify the terms in (2.5) with the kinetic energy, the damping energy loss and the
potential energy of the oscillator respectively. For simple harmonic motion of the form
x = |x0| cos ωt, the average kinetic and potential energies are:
average kinetic energy = 1
4m|x0|2ω2
0;
average potential energy = 1
4k|x0|2 .
If the damping is very small, the natural frequency of oscillation of the oscillator is ω2
0 =
k/m. Thus, the average kinetic and potential energies of the oscillator are equal and the
total energy is the sum of the two,
E = 1
2m|x0|2ω2
0 .

Inspection of the second term on the left-hand side of (2.5) shows that the average rate of
loss of energy by radiation from the oscillator is

(2.7)
This relation can now be compared with the expression for the loss rate by radiation of the
oscillator (2.4). We obtain the correct expression for the decay in amplitude of the oscillator
by identifying γ with a/m in (2.7). This phenomenon is known as the radiation damping
of an oscillator.
We can appreciate now why Planck believed this was a fruitful way of attacking the
problem. The radiation loss does not go into heat, but into electromagnetic radiation and
the constant γ depends only upon fundamental constants, if we take the oscillator to be an
oscillating electron. In contrast, in frictional damping, the energy goes into heat and the
loss rate formula contains constants appropriate to the material. Furthermore, in the case
of electromagnetic waves, if the oscillators and waves are conﬁned within an enclosure
with perfectly reﬂecting walls, energy is not lost from the system and the waves can react
back on the oscillators returning energy to them.4 This is why Planck called the damping
conservative damping.
2.3.3 The equilibrium radiation spectrum of a harmonic oscillator
The expressions for the dynamics of an oscillator undergoing radiation, or natural, damping
which have just been derived are:
m ¨x + a ˙x + kx = 0;
¨x + γ ˙x + ω2
0x = 0 .
(2.8)
If an electromagnetic wave is incident on the oscillator, energy can be transferred to it and
a forcing term is added to (2.8),
¨x + γ ˙x + ω2
0x = F
m .
(2.9)
If the oscillator is accelerated by the E ﬁeld of an incident wave, F = eE0 exp(iωt). To ﬁnd
the response of the oscillator, a trial solution for x of the form x = |x0| exp(iωt) is adopted.
Then
|x0| =

(2.10)
Notice that there is a complex factor in the denominator and this means that the oscillator
does not vibrate in phase with the incident wave. This does not matter for our calculation.
We are only interested in the square of the modulus of the amplitude.
Now, let us work out the rate of radiation of the oscillator under the inﬂuence of the
incident radiation ﬁeld. If we set this equal to the ‘natural’ radiation of the oscillator, we
will have found the equilibrium spectrum – the work done by the incident radiation ﬁeld is
just enough to supply the energy loss per second by the oscillator. From (2.2), the rate of

The next step is to note that the loss rate (2.12) is part of a continuum intensity distribution
and so this sum can be written as an incident intensity5 in the frequency band ω to ω + dω,

Now the response curve of the oscillator is very sharply peaked about the value ω0,
because the radiation rate is very small in comparison with the total energy of the oscillator,
that is, γ ≪1 (see Fig. 2.3). We can therefore make some simplifying approximations.
If ω appears on its own, ω →ω0 and (ω2

The rate of radiation should now be set equal to the spontaneous radiation rate of the
oscillator. There is only one complication. We have assumed that the oscillator can re-
spond to incident radiation arriving from any direction. For a single oscillator with axis in,
say, the x-direction, there are directions of incidence in which the oscillator does not re-
spond to the incident wave – this occurs if a component of the incident electric ﬁeld is
perpendicular to the dipole axis of the oscillator. We get round this problem by the argu-
ment used by Richard Feynman. Suppose three oscillators are mutually at right angles to
each other. Then this system can respond like a completely free oscillator and follow any
incident electric ﬁeld. Therefore, we obtain the correct result if we suppose that (2.17) is
the radiation which would be emitted by three mutually perpendicular oscillators, each os-
cillating at frequency ω0. Equating (2.17) to three times (2.4), we ﬁnd the rather remarkable
result:

(2.20)
This is the remarkable result published by Planck in June 1899 (Planck, 1899). All
information about the nature of the oscillator has completely disappeared from the problem.
All that remains is the average energy of the oscillator. The meaning behind the relation is
obviously very deep and fundamental in a thermodynamic sense. The whole analysis has
proceeded through a study of the electrodynamics of oscillators, and yet the ﬁnal result
contains no trace of the means by which we arrived at the answer. One can appreciate how
excited Planck must have been when he discovered this basic result – if we can work out
the average energy of an oscillator of frequency ν in an enclosure at temperature T , we can
ﬁnd immediately the spectrum of black-body radiation.
2.3.4 Rayleigh and the spectrum of black-body radiation
In fact, the same relation (2.20) between the average energy of an oscillator and the
intensity of radiation in thermal equilibrium was also worked out by a completely different
route by John William Strutt, Baron Rayleigh in 1900.7 Rayleigh was the author of the
famous book The Theory of Sound (1894) and so approached the problem from the point
of view of the equilibrium distribution of waves in a box (Rayleigh, 1900). Suppose the
box is a cube with sides of length L. Inside the box, all possible wave modes consistent
with the boundary conditions are allowed to come into thermodynamic equilibrium at
temperature T . The wave equation for the waves in the box is
∇2ψ = ∂2ψ
∂x2 + ∂2ψ
∂y2 + ∂2ψ
∂z2 = 1
c2s
∂2ψ
∂t2 ,
(2.21)
where cs is the speed of the waves. The walls are ﬁxed and so the waves must have zero
amplitude ψ = 0 at x, y, z = 0 and x, y, z = L. The solution of this problem is well-known:
ψ = Ce−iωt sin lπx
L
sin mπy
L
sin nπz
L
,
(2.22)
corresponding to standing waves which ﬁt perfectly into the box in three dimensions,
provided l, m and n are integers. Each combination of l, m and n is called a mode of
oscillation of the waves in the box. These modes are complete, independent and orthogonal
and so represent all the ways in which the medium can oscillate within the box.

Planck and black-body radiation
We now substitute (2.22) into the wave equation (2.21) and ﬁnd the relation between the
values of l, m, n and the angular frequency of the waves, ω,
ω2
c2 = π2
L2 (l2 + m2 + n2) = π2 p2
L2
,
(2.23)
where p2 = l2 + m2 + n2. We thus ﬁnd a relation between the modes as parameterised by
p2 = l2 + m2 + n2 and their angular frequency ω. According to the Maxwell–Boltzmann
equipartition theorem, energy is shared equally among each independent mode and so we
need to know the number of modes in the range p to p + dp. We ﬁnd this by drawing a
three-dimensional lattice in l, m, n space and evaluating the number of modes in the octant
of a sphere in (l, m, n) space. If p is large, the number of modes in an octant of a spherical
shell of radius p and width dp is,
n(p) dp = L3ω2
2π2c3 dω .
(2.24)
The waves are electromagnetic waves and so there are two independent linear polarisations
for any given mode. Therefore, there are twice as many modes as given by (2.24).
According to the Maxwell–Boltzmann doctrine of the equipartition of energy, each mode
of oscillation has average energy E. Then, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation
in the box is:
u(ν) dν L3 = En(p) dp = L3ω2E
π2c3
dω ,
(2.25)
that is,
u(ν) = 8πν2
c3
E ,
(2.26)
exactly the same result as that derived by Planck from electrodynamics (2.20).
A number of features of Rayleigh’s analysis are worth noting. First of all, Rayleigh deals
directly with the electromagnetic waves themselves, rather than with the oscillators which
are the source of the waves and which are in equilibrium with them. Second, central to the
result is the doctrine of the equipartition of energy. What the Maxwell–Boltzmann doctrine
states is that, if the system is left long enough, irregularities in the energy distribution
among the oscillations are smoothed out by various energy interchange mechanisms. In
many natural phenomena, the equilibrium distributions are set up very quickly.
2.4 Towards the spectrum of black-body radiation
Planck’s next step is at ﬁrst slightly surprising. Classically, in thermodynamic equilibrium,
each degree of freedom is allocated 1
2kT of energy and hence the mean energy of a harmonic
oscillator should be E = kT , because it has two degrees of freedom, those associated with

the squared terms ˙x2 and x2 in the expression for its energy. Setting E = kT , we ﬁnd
u(ν) = 8πν2
c3
kT ,
(2.27)
exactly the result derived by Rayleigh. This turned out to be the correct expression for the
black-body radiation law at low frequencies, the Rayleigh–Jeans law. Why did Planck not
do this? First of all, the equipartition theorem of Maxwell and Boltzmann is a result of
statistical thermodynamics and this was the point of view which Planck had rejected. As we
discussed in Sect. 1.3, it was far from clear in 1899 how secure the equipartition theorem
really was. Planck had already had his ﬁngers burned by Boltzmann when he failed to note
the necessity of statistical assumptions in order to derive the equilibrium state of black-body
radiation (Sect. 2.3). He therefore adopted a rather different approach. To quote his words:
‘I had no alternative than to tackle the problem once again – this time from the opposite
side – namely from the side of thermodynamics, my own home territory where I felt myself
to be on safer ground. In fact, my previous studies of the Second Law of Thermodynamics
came to stand me in good stead now, for at the very outset I hit upon the idea of correlating
not the temperature of the oscillator but its entropy with its energy . . . While a host of
outstanding physicists worked on the problem of the spectral energy distribution both
from the experimental and theoretical aspect, every one of them directed his efforts solely
towards exhibiting the dependence of the intensity of radiation on the temperature. On the
other hand, I suspected that the fundamental connection lies in the dependence of entropy
upon energy. . . . Nobody paid any attention to the method which I adopted and I could
work out my calculations completely at my leisure, with absolute thoroughness, without
fear of interference or competition.’ (Planck, 1950)
In March 1900, Planck worked out the following relation for the change in entropy of a
system which is not in equilibrium (Planck, 1900a):
S = 3
5
∂2S
∂E2 E dE .
(2.28)
This equation applies to an oscillator the entropy of which deviates from the maximum
value in that an individual resonator deviates by an amount E from the equilibrium energy
E. The entropy change occurs when the energy of the oscillator is changed by dE. Thus,
if E and dE have opposite signs, so that the system tends to return towards equilibrium,
the entropy change is positive and the function ∂2S/∂E2 must necessarily have a negative
value. A negative value of ∂2S/∂E2 means that there is an entropy maximum and thus if
E and dE are of opposite signs, the system must approach equilibrium.
To appreciate what Planck did next, we need to review the dramatic developments in the
experimental determinations of the properties of black-body radiation. Otto Lummer had
been appointed to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstaldt in Berlin in 1887 and led
the group involved in establishing standards of luminosity. There was no intention initially
to determine the spectrum of black-body radiation, but this came about through the need
to develop precision methods of measurement of optical and infrared intensities. He was
joined by Ferdinand Kurlbaum in 1891 at the Reichsanstaldt and collaborated with Ernst
Pringsheim, who was appointed to a titular professorship at the University of Berlin in 1896,

and by Heinrich Rubens who was appointed to a professorship of physics at the Technische
Hochschule of Berlin in 1896.
This group made enormous advances in the determination of the properties of black-body
radiation. In particular, they emphasised the importance of developing sources of radiation
which were as uniform as possible. The preferred solution was to bring a cavity to as
uniform a temperature as possible and then allow the radiation to pass outwards through an
opening (Fig. 2.4a). In addition, Rubens pioneered the techniques of precise photometric
measurement in the infrared regions of the spectrum which were to be crucial in the coming
years.
Wien (1896) followed up his studies of the spectrum of thermal radiation by attempting
to derive the radiation law from theory. We need not go into his ideas, but he derived an
expression for the radiation law which was consistent with his displacement law and which
provided an excellent ﬁt to all the data available in 1896. Wien’s theory suggested that,
consistent with his displacement law, the spectrum should have the form
u(ν) = 8πα
c3 ν3e−βν/T .
(2.29)
This is Wien’s law, written in our notation. There are two unknown constants in the formula,
α and β; the constant 8π/c3 has been included on the right-hand side for reasons which
will become apparent in a moment. Rayleigh’s comment on Wien’s paper was terse:
‘Viewed from the theoretical side, the result appears to me to be little more than a
conjecture.’ (Rayleigh, 1900)

2.4 Towards the spectrum of black-body radiation
The importance of the formula was that it gave an excellent account of all the experimental
data available at the time and therefore could be used in theoretical studies. Typical black-
body spectra are shown in Fig. 2.4b. The wavelength regions close to the maxima were best
deﬁned by the experimental data – the uncertainties in the wings of the energy distribution
were much greater.
Returning to Planck’s paper of March 1900, the next step was the deﬁnition of the entropy
S of an oscillator,
S = −E
βν ln E
ανe ,
(2.30)
where E is its energy, α and β are the constants in Wien’s law and e is the base of natural
logarithms. In fact, Planck worked backwards from Wien’s law to determine this relation.8
The next step was crucial for Planck. The second derivative of (2.30) with respect to E
is needed in order to apply (2.28) to the black-body spectrum:
d2S
dE2 = −1
βν
1
E .
(2.31)
β, ν and E are all necessarily positive quantities and so ∂2S/∂E2 is necessarily negative.
Therefore, according to (2.28), Wien’s law is entirely consistent with the second law of
thermodynamics. The simplicity of the expression for the second derivative of the entropy
with respect to energy profoundly impressed Planck who remarked:
‘I have repeatedly tried to change or generalise the equation for the electromagnetic
entropy of an oscillator in such a way that it satisﬁes all theoretically sound electromagnetic
and thermodynamic laws but I was unsuccessful in this endeavour.’ (Planck, 1900a)
In his paper presented to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in May 1899 he stated:
‘I believe that this must lead me to conclude that the deﬁnition of radiation entropy and
therefore Wien’s energy distribution law necessarily result from the application of the
principle of the increase of entropy to the electromagnetic radiation theory and therefore
the limits of validity of this law, in so far as they exist at all, coincide with those of the
second law of thermodynamics.’ (Planck, 1899)
Planck had gone too far – in fact, many negative functions of energy would have satisﬁed
Planck’s requirement so far as the second law of thermodynamics was concerned.
These calculations were presented to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in June 1900.
By October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum had shown beyond any doubt that Wien’s law was
inadequate to explain the spectrum of black-body radiation at low frequencies and high
temperatures. They showed that, at low frequencies and high temperatures, the intensity
of radiation was proportional to temperature. This is clearly inconsistent with Wien’s
law because, if u(ν) ∝ν3 e−βν/T , then for βν/T ≪1, u(ν) ∝ν3 and is independent of
temperature. Therefore, the functional dependence must depart from (2.30) and (2.31) for
small values of ν/T .
Rubens and Kurlbaum showed Planck their results before they were presented in October
1900 and he was given the opportunity to make some remarks about their implications. The
result was his paper entitled On an improvement of Wien’s spectral distribution (Planck,

1900b). Here is what Planck did. At low frequencies ν/T →0, the experiments of Rubens
and Kurlbaum showed that u(ν) ∝T . The thermodynamic relations between S, E and T are
E ∝T,
dS
dE = 1
T .
Hence
dS
dE ∝1
E ,
d2S
dE2 ∝1

(2.32)
Therefore, d2S/dE2 must change its functional dependence upon E between large and
small values of ν/T . Wien’s law remains good for large values of ν/T and leads to
d2S
dE2 ∝1
E .
(2.33)
The standard technique for combining functions of the form (2.32) and (2.33) is to try an
expression of the form
d2S
dE2 = −
a
E(b + E) ,
(2.34)
which has exactly the required properties for large and small values of E, E ≫b and E ≪b
respectively. The rest of the analysis is straightforward.9 Integrating with respect to E,

Thus b must be proportional to the frequency ν. We can now write Planck’s formula in its

Of equal importance for the next part of the story is that Planck was also able to ﬁnd an

2.5 Comparison of the laws for black-body radiation with experiment
In their presentation of 25 October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum compared their new precise
measurements of the spectrum of black-body radiation with ﬁve different formulae. Two
of these were empirical relations proposed by Thiesen and by Lummer and Jahnke. The
others were:
r Wien’s relation (2.29);
r Planck’s formula (2.38);
r Rayleigh’s result (2.27), but modiﬁed to avoid the divergence of the Rayleigh–Jeans spec-
trum at high frequencies, the problem known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. Rayleigh was
well aware of ‘the difﬁculties which attend the Boltzmann–Maxwell doctrine of the
partition of energy’ and that (2.27) must break down at high frequencies because the
spectrum of black-body radiation does not increase as ν2 to inﬁnite frequency. In
the ﬁfth paragraph of his short paper, he stated, ‘If we introduce the exponential fac-
tor, the complete expression is’, in our notation,
u(ν) = 8πν2

kT e−βν/T .

Planck and black-body radiation
that Planck’s formula was superior to all the others and that it gave precise agreement with
experiment. Rayleigh’s proposal was found to be a poor representation of the experimental
data. Rayleigh was somewhat upset by the tone of voice in which they discussed his result.
When his scientiﬁc papers were republished two years later he remarked on his important
conclusion that the intensity of radiation should be proportional to temperature at low
frequencies. He pointed out,
‘This is what I intended to emphasise. Very shortly afterwards the anticipation above
expressed was conﬁrmed by the important researches of Rubens and Kurlbaum who
operated with exceptionally long waves.’ (Rayleigh, 1902)
Despite this success, Planck had not explained anything. The formula he derived was
based upon essentially thermodynamic arguments guided by experiment without theoretical
understanding at the microscopic level. The formula (2.38) was presented to the German
Physical Society on 19 October 1900 and on 14 December 1900, he presented another
paper entitled On the theory of the energy distribution law in the normal spectrum (Planck,
1900c). In his memoirs, he wrote
‘After a few weeks of the most strenuous work of my life, the darkness lifted and an
unexpected vista began to appear.’ (Planck, 1925)
2.6 Planck’s theory of black-body radiation
In his scientiﬁc biography, Planck wrote:
‘On the very day when I formulated this law, I began to devote myself to the task of
investing it with a true physical meaning. This quest automatically led me to study the
interrelation of entropy and probability – in other words, to pursue the line of thought
inaugurated by Boltzmann.’ (Planck, 1950)
Planck recognised that the way forward involved adopting a point of view which he had
rejected in essentially all his previous work. He was not a specialist in statistical physics and
we will ﬁnd that his analysis did not follow the precepts of classical statistical mechanics.
Despite the basic ﬂaws in his argument, he discovered the essential role which quantisation
plays in accounting for the spectrum of black-body radiation.
Planck’s analysis began by following Boltzmann’s procedure. There is a ﬁxed total energy
E to be divided among the N oscillators and energy elements ε are introduced. Therefore,
there arer = E/ε energy elements to be shared among the oscillators. Rather than following
Boltzmann’s procedure in statistical physics, however, Planck simply worked out the total
number of ways in which r energy elements can be distributed over the N oscillators. The
answer is10
(N + r −1)!
r!(r −1)!
.

Now Planck made the crucial step in his argument. He deﬁned (2.41) to be the probability
p to be used in Boltzmann’s expression for the entropy

But this looks rather familiar. The relation (2.46) is exactly the expression (2.39) for the

with the requirement b ∝ν. Thus, the energy elements ε must be proportional to frequency
and Planck wrote this requirement in the familiar form
ε = hν ,
(2.47)
where h is rightly known as Planck’s constant. This is the origin of the concept of quan-
tisation. According to the procedures of classical statistical mechanics, we ought now to
allow ε →0, but evidently we cannot obtain the expression for the entropy of an oscillator
unless the energy elements do not disappear, but have ﬁnite magnitude ε = hν. Therefore,
the expression for the energy density of black-body radiation is

Planck and black-body radiation
Finally, what about C? Planck pointed out that C is a universal constant relating the
entropy to the probability. Therefore, any suitable law such as the perfect gas law which
determines its value determines C for all processes. For example, we could use the results
of the Joule expansion of a perfect gas, treated classically and statistically. Then, the ratio
C = k = R/NA, where R is the gas constant and NA is Avogadro’s number, the number of
molecules per gram molecule.11 Hence, the Planck distribution in its ﬁnal form is:

This provides the determination of the value of the Stefan–Boltzmann constant σ in terms
of fundamental constants.
What is one to make of Planck’s argument? There are two fundamental concerns:
(1) Planck certainly does not follow Boltzmann’s procedure for ﬁnding the equilibrium
energy distribution of the oscillators. What he deﬁnes as a probability is not really
a probability of anything drawn from any parent population. Planck had no illusions
about this. In his own words:
‘In my opinion, this stipulation basically amounts to a deﬁnition of the probability
W; for we have absolutely no point of departure, in the assumptions which underlie
the electromagnetic theory of radiation, for talking about such a probability with a
deﬁnite meaning.’13
Einstein repeatedly pointed out this weak point in Planck’s argument:
‘The manner in which Mr Planck uses Boltzmann’s equation is rather strange to
me in that a probability of a state W is introduced without a physical deﬁnition of
this quantity. If one accepts this, then Boltzmann’s equation simply has no physical
meaning.’ (Einstein, 1912)
(2) A second problem concerns a logical inconsistency in Planck’s analysis. On the one
hand, the oscillators can only take energies E = rε and yet a classical result (2.1) has
been used to work out the rate of radiation of the oscillator. Implicit in that analysis

2.7 Planck and ‘natural units’
is the assumption that the energies of the oscillators can vary continuously rather than
take only discrete values.
These were major stumbling blocks and nobody quite understood the signiﬁcance of
what Planck had done. The theory did not in any sense gain immediate acceptance, there
being no further papers by Planck or others until Einstein’s papers of 1905 and 1906.
Nonetheless, the concept of quantisation had been introduced through the energy elements
ε without which it is not possible to reproduce the Planck distribution. In fact, in 1906
Einstein showed that, if Planck had followed strictly Boltzmann’s procedure, he would have
obtained the same answer whilst maintaining the essential concept of energy quantisation
(Sect. 3.3).
Why did Planck ﬁnd the correct expression for the radiation spectrum, despite the fact
that the statistical procedures he used were more than a little suspect? It seems quite likely
that Planck worked backwards. It was suggested by Rosenfeld, and endorsed by Klein on
the basis of an article by Planck of 1943, that he started with the expression of the entropy
of an oscillator (2.39) and worked backwards to ﬁnd W from exp(S/k). This results in the
permutation formula on the right-hand side of (2.43), which is more or less exactly the same
as (2.41) for large values of N and r. The expression (2.41) was a well-known formula
in permutation theory and appears early in Boltzmann’s exposition of the fundamentals
of statistical physics. Planck then regarded (2.46) as the deﬁnition of entropy according
to statistical physics. If this is indeed what happened, it in no sense diminishes Planck’s
achievement.
2.7 Planck and ‘natural units’
Planck appreciated that there are two fundamental constants in his theory of black-body
radiation, Boltzmann’s constant k and the new constant h, which Planck was to refer to as
the quantum of action. The fundamental nature of k was apparent from its appearance in
the kinetic theory as the gas constant per molecule and as the constant C in Boltzmann’s
relation S = k ln W. Both constants could be determined with considerable precision from
the experimentally measured form of the spectrum of black-body radiation (2.49), and from
the value of the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (2.50) or (2.51). Combining the known value
of the gas constant R with his new determination of k, Planck found a value of Avogadro’s
number, NA = 6.175 × 1023 molecules per mole, by far the best estimate known at that
time. The present adopted value is NA = 6.022 × 1023 molecules per mole.
The electric charge carried by a gram equivalent of monovalent ions was known from
electrolytic theory and is known as Faraday’s constant. Knowing NA precisely, Planck was
able to derive the elementary unit of charge and found it to be e = 4.69 × 10−10 esu,
corresponding to 1.56 × 10−19 C. Again, Planck’s value was by far the best available at
that time, contemporary experimental values ranging between 1.3 and 6.5 ×10−10 esu. The
present standard value is 1.602 × 10−19 C.

Equally compelling for Planck was the fact that h, in conjunction with the constant of
gravitation G and the velocity of light c, enabled a set of ‘natural’ units to be deﬁned in
terms of fundamental constants (Table 2.1). Often these Planck units are written in terms of
¯h = h/2π, in which case their values are 2.5 times smaller than those quoted in the table. It
is evident that the natural units of time and length are very small indeed, while the mass is
much greater than that of any known elementary particle. A century later, these quantities
were to play a central role in the physics of the very early Universe.
2.8 Planck and the physical significance of h
It was a number of years before the truly revolutionary nature of what Planck had achieved in
these crucial last months of 1900 was appreciated. Perhaps surprisingly, he wrote no papers
on the subject of quantisation over the next ﬁve years. The next publication which casts
some light on his understanding was his text Lectures on the Theory of Thermal Radiation
of 1906 (Planck, 1906). Thomas Kuhn gives a detailed analysis of Planck’s thoughts on
quantisation through the period 1900–1906 (Kuhn, 1978). What is clear from Kuhn’s
analysis is that Planck undoubtedly believed that the classical laws of electromagnetism
were applicable to the processes of the emission and absorption of radiation, despite the
introduction of the ﬁnite energy elements in his theory of quantisation. Planck describes
two versions of Boltzmann’s procedure in statistical physics, the ﬁrst being the version
described in Sect. 2.6, in which the energies of the oscillators take values 0, ε, 2ε, 3ε, and
so on. There is a second version in which the molecules were considered to lie within the
energy ranges 0 to ε, ε to 2ε, 2ε to 3ε, and so on. This procedure leads to exactly the same
statistical probabilities as the ﬁrst version. In a subsequent passage, in which the motions
of the oscillators are traced in phase space, he again refers to the energies of the trajectories
corresponding to certain energy ranges U to U + U, the U eventually being identiﬁed
with hν. Thus, Planck regarded quantisation as referring to the average properties of the
oscillators.
Planck had little to say about the nature of the quantum of action h, but he was well
aware of its fundamental importance. In his words,
‘The thermodynamics of radiation will therefore not be brought to an entirely satisfactory
state until the full and universal signiﬁcance of the constant h is understood.’ (Kuhn,
1978)

2.8 Planck and the physical significance of h
Planck spent many years trying to reconcile his theory with classical physics, but he
failed to ﬁnd any physical signiﬁcance for h beyond its appearance in the radiation formula.
In his words:
‘My futile attempts to ﬁt the elementary quantum of action somehow into the classical
theory continued for a number of years and they cost me a great deal of effort. Many of
my colleagues saw in this something bordering on tragedy. But I feel differently about it.
For the thorough enlightenment I thus received was all the more valuable. I now knew for
a fact that the elementary quantum of action played a far more signiﬁcant part in physics
than I had originally been inclined to suspect and this recognition made me see clearly the
need for the introduction of totally new methods of analysis and reasoning in the treatment
of atomic problems.’ (Planck, 1950)
It was not until after about 1908 that Planck fully appreciated the quite fundamental nature
of quantisation, which has no counterpart in classical physics. His original view was that
the introduction of energy elements was
‘a purely formal assumption and I really did not give it much thought except that no matter
what the cost, I must bring about a positive result.’ (Planck, 1931a)
Later in the same letter, he writes:
‘It was clear to me that classical physics could offer no solution to this problem and would
have meant that all energy would eventually transfer from matter into radiation. In order
to prevent this, a new constant is required to assure that energy does not disintegrate.
But the only way to recognise how this can be done is to start from a deﬁnite point of
view. This approach was opened to me by maintaining the two laws of thermodynamics.
The two laws, it seems to me, must be upheld under all circumstances. For the rest, I was
ready to sacriﬁce every one of my previous convictions about physical laws.’

Einstein and quanta 1900–1911
3.1 Einstein in 1905
The next great steps were taken by Albert Einstein and it is no exaggeration to state that
he was the ﬁrst person to appreciate the full signiﬁcance of quantisation and the reality of
quanta. He showed that these are fundamental aspects of all physical phenomena, rather
than just a ‘formal device’ for accounting for the Planck distribution. From 1905 onwards,
he never deviated from his belief in the reality of quanta – it was some considerable time
before the great ﬁgures of the day conceded that Einstein was indeed correct.
Einstein completed what we would now call his undergraduate studies in August 1900.
Between 1902 and 1904, he wrote three papers on the foundations of Boltzmann’s statistical
mechanics. In 1905, Einstein was 26 and employed as ‘technical expert, third class’ at the
Swiss patent ofﬁce in Bern. In that year, he completed his doctoral dissertation on A new
determination of molecular dimensions, which he presented to the University of Zurich on
20 July 1905. In the same year, he published three papers which are among the greatest
classics in the literature of physics.1 Any one of them would have ensured that his name
remained a permanent ﬁxture in the scientiﬁc literature. These papers are:
(1) On a heuristic point of view concerning the production and transformation of light
(Einstein, 1905a);
(2) On the motion of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the
molecular-kinetic theory of heat (Einstein, 1905b);
(3) On the electrodynamics of moving bodies (Einstein, 1905c).
The third paper is Einstein’s paper on the special theory of relativity which was described
brieﬂy in Sect. 1.5. The second paper conﬁrmed the correctness of the kinetic theory while
the ﬁrst introduces the concept of light quanta to describe the spectrum of black-body
radiation. Einstein confessed that he was no mathematician and the mathematics needed
to understand his papers of 1905 is no more than is taught in the ﬁrst two years of an
undergraduate physics course. His genius lay in his extraordinary physical intuition, which
enabled him to see deeper into physical problems than his contemporaries. The three great
papers were not the result of a sudden burst of creativity, but the product of deep pondering
about the fundamental problems of physics over almost a decade. His deliberations on
all three topics suddenly came to fruition almost simultaneously in 1905. Despite their
obvious differences, the three papers have a striking commonality of approach. In each

3.2 Einstein on Brownian motion
case, Einstein stands back from the speciﬁc problem at hand and studies the underlying
physical principles.
3.2 Einstein on Brownian motion
The second paper is more familiarly known by the title of a subsequent paper published in
1906 entitled On the theory of Brownian motion (Einstein, 1906a) and is a reworking of
some of the results of his doctoral dissertation. Brownian motion is the irregular motion
of microscopic particles in ﬂuids and had been studied in detail in 1828 by the botanist
Robert Brown, who had noted the ubiquity of the phenomenon. The motion results from
the statistical effect of very large numbers of collisions between molecules of the ﬂuid and
the microscopic particles. Although each impact is very small, the net result of a very large
number of them randomly colliding with the particle is a ‘drunken man’s walk’. Einstein
was not certain about the applicability of his analysis to Brownian motion, writing in the
introduction to his paper:
‘It is possible that the movements to be discussed here are identical with the so-called
‘Brownian molecular motion’; however, the information available to me regarding the
latter is so lacking in precision that I can form no judgment in the matter.’
In his autobiographical notes, he stated that he wrote the paper ‘without knowing that
observations concerning Brownian motion were already long familiar’ (Einstein, 1979).
Einstein begins with Stokes’ formula for the force acting on a sphere of radius a moving
at speed v through a medium of kinematic viscosity ν, F = 6π ν a v, where a is the radius of
the sphere and ν the coefﬁcient of kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid. By considering the one-
dimensional diffusion of the particles in the steady state, he found the diffusion coefﬁcient
for the particles in the medium, D = kT/6πνa, and from this the one-dimensional distance
the particle diffuses ⟨λ2
x⟩= 2Dt in time t. The result is his famous formula for the mean
squared distance travelled by the particle in time t in one dimension,
⟨λ2
x⟩= kT t
3πνa ,
(3.1)
where T is the temperature and k Boltzmann’s constant. Crucially, Einstein had discov-
ered the relation between the molecular properties of ﬂuids and the observed diffusion of
macroscopic particles. In his estimates of the magnitude of the effect for particles 1 μm
in diameter, he needed a value for Avogadro’s number NA and he used the values which
Planck and he had found from their studies of the spectrum of black-body radiation (see
Sect. 3.3 below). He predicted that such particles would diffuse about 6 μm in one minute.
In the last paragraph of the paper, Einstein states:
‘Let us hope that a researcher will soon succeed in solving the problem presented here,
which is so important for the theory of heat!’

drawing is based upon diagrams in Perrin’s paper of 1909 (Perrin, 1909).
Precise observations of Brownian motion were difﬁcult at that time, but in 1908, Jean
Perrin (1909) carried out a meticulous series of brilliant experiments which conﬁrmed in
detail all Einstein’s predictions (Fig. 3.1). This work convinced everyone, even the sceptics,
of the reality of molecules. In Perrin’s words,
‘I think it is impossible that a mind free from all preconception can reﬂect upon the
extreme diversity of the phenomena which thus converge to the same result without
experiencing a strong impression, and I think it will henceforth be difﬁcult to defend by
rational arguments a hostile attitude to molecular hypotheses.’ (Perrin, 1910)
Einstein was well aware of the importance of this calculation for the theory of heat – the
agitational motion of the particles observed in Brownian motion is heat, the macroscopic
particles reﬂecting the motion of the molecules on the microscopic scale.
3.3 Onaheuristicviewpointconcerningtheproductionand
transformationoflight (Einstein 1905a)
The ﬁrst paper listed in Sect. 3.1 is often referred to as Einstein’s paper on the photoelectric
effect but that scarcely does justice to its profundity. In a letter to his friend Conrad Habicht
in May 1905, Einstein wrote:
‘I promise you four papers . . . the ﬁrst of which I could send you soon, since I will soon
receive the free reprints. The paper deals with radiation and the energetic properties of
light and is very revolutionary, . . . ’ (Einstein, 1993)

3.3 Onaheuristicviewpoint
Here are the opening paragraphs of Einstein’s great paper. They demand attention, like the
opening of a great symphony.
‘There is a profound formal difference between the theoretical ideas which physicists
have formed concerning gases and other ponderable bodies and Maxwell’s theory of
electromagnetic processes in so-called empty space. Thus, while we consider the state
of a body to be completely deﬁned by the positions and velocities of a very large but
ﬁnite number of atoms and electrons, we use continuous three-dimensional functions to
determine the electromagnetic state existing within some region, so that a ﬁnite num-
ber of dimensions is not sufﬁcient to determine the electromagnetic state of the region
completely . . .
The undulatory theory of light, which operates with continuous three-dimensional
functions, applies extremely well to the explanation of purely optical phenomena and will
probably never be replaced by any other theory. However, it should be kept in mind that
optical observations refer to values averaged over time and not to instantaneous values.
Despite the complete experimental veriﬁcation of the theory of diffraction, reﬂection,
refraction, dispersion and so on, it is conceivable that a theory of light operating with
continuous three-dimensional functions will lead to conﬂicts with experience if it is
applied to the phenomena of light generation and conversion.’ (Einstein, 1905b)
In other words, there may well be circumstances under which Maxwell’s theory of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld cannot explain all electromagnetic phenomena and Einstein speciﬁ-
cally gives as examples the spectrum of black-body radiation, photoluminescence and the
photoelectric effect. His proposal is that, for some purposes, it may be more appropriate to
consider light to be
‘discontinuously distributed in space. According to the assumption considered here, in
the propagation of a light ray emitted from a point source, the energy is not distributed
continuously over ever-increasing volumes of space, but consists of a ﬁnite number of
energy quanta localised at points in space that move without dividing, and can be absorbed
and generated only as complete units.’
He ends by hoping that
‘the approach to be presented will prove of use to some researchers in their investigations.’
Notice how Einstein’s proposal differs from Planck’s approach. Planck found that the ‘en-
ergy elements’ ε = hν associated with the oscillators in thermal equilibrium at temperature
T must not vanish. These oscillators are the source of the electromagnetic radiation in the
black-body spectrum, but Planck had absolutely nothing to say about the radiation emitted
by them. He ﬁrmly believed that the waves emitted by the oscillators were the classical
electromagnetic waves of Maxwell. In contrast, Einstein proposes that the radiation ﬁeld
itself should be quantised.
After the introduction, Einstein states Planck’s formula (2.26) relating the average energy
of an oscillator to the energy density of black-body radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium
but does not hesitate to set the average energy of the oscillator E = kT according to the
kinetic theory. He then writes the total energy in the black-body spectrum in the provocative

(3.2)
This is exactly the problem which had been pointed out by Rayleigh in 1900 and which led to
his arbitrary introduction of the exponential factor to prevent the spectrum diverging at high
frequencies (see Sect. 2.5). This phenomenon was later called the ultraviolet catastrophe
by Paul Ehrenfest.
Einstein next goes on to show that, despite the high frequency divergence of the expression
(3.2), it is a very good description of the black-body radiation spectrum at low frequencies
and high temperatures, and hence the value of Boltzmann’s constant k can be derived from
that part of the spectrum alone. Einstein’s value of k agreed precisely with Planck’s estimate,
which Einstein interpreted as meaning that Planck’s estimate was independent of the details
of the theory he had developed to account for the black-body spectrum.
We have already emphasised the central role which entropy plays in the thermodynamics
of radiation. Einstein now derives a suitable form for the entropy of the spectrum of black-
body radiation using only thermodynamics and the observed form of the radiation spectrum.
Entropies are additive, and since, in thermal equilibrium, we may consider the radiation of
different wavelengths to be independent, we can write the entropy of the radiation enclosed
in volume V as
S = V
 ∞
0
φ[u(ν), ν] dν .
(3.3)
The function φ is the entropy of the radiation per unit frequency interval per unit volume.
The aim of the calculation is to ﬁnd an expression for the function φ in terms of the spectral
energy density u(ν) and frequency ν. No other quantities besides the temperature T can
be involved in the expression for the equilibrium spectrum, as was shown by Kirchhoff
(see Sect. 1.6). The problem had already been solved by Wien but Einstein gives an elegant
proof of the result,2

Einstein now uses (3.5) to work out the entropy of black-body radiation. Rather than use
Planck’s formula, he uses Wien’s formula since, although it is not correct for low frequencies
and high temperatures, it is the correct law in the region where the classical theory breaks
down and so the analysis of this part of the spectrum is likely to give insight into where the
classical calculation goes wrong.

(3.9)
Suppose the volume changes from V0 to V , while the total energy remains constant. Then,
the entropy change is
S −S0 = ε
βν ln(V/V0) .
(3.10)
But this formula looks familiar. Einstein shows that this entropy change is exactly the
same as that found in the Joule expansion of a perfect gas according to elementary statistical
mechanics. Boltzmann’s relation S = k ln W can be used to work out the entropy difference
S −S0 between the initial and ﬁnal states, S −S0 = k ln W/W0, where the Ws are the
probabilities of these states. In the initial state, the system has volume V0 and the particles
move randomly throughout this volume. The probability that a single particle occupies a
smaller volume V is V/V0 and hence the probability that all N end up in this volume V is
(V/V0)N. Therefore, the entropy difference for a gas of N particles is
S −S0 = kN ln(V/V0) .
(3.11)
Einstein notes that (3.10) and (3.11) are formally identical. He immediately concludes
that the radiation behaves thermodynamically as if it consisted of discrete particles, their
number N being equal to ε/kβν. In Einstein’s own words,
‘Monochromatic radiation of low density (within the limits of validity of Wien’s radiation
formula) behaves thermodynamically as though it consisted of a number of independent
energy quanta of magnitude kβν.’
Rewriting this result in Planck’s notation, since β = h/k, the energy of each quantum

Einstein and quanta 1900–1911
Einstein then works out the average energy of the quanta according to Wien’s formula for
black-body radiation. The energy in the frequency interval ν to ν + dν is ε and the number
of quanta is ε/kβν. Therefore, the average energy is
E =
 ∞
0 (8πα/c3)ν3 e−βν/T dν
 ∞
0 (8πα/c3)(ν3/kβν) e−βν/T dν = kβ
 ∞
0 ν3 e−βν/T dν
 ∞
0 ν2 e−βν/T dν = kβ × 3T
β = 3kT .
(3.12)
The average energy of the quanta is closely related to the mean kinetic energy per particle
in the black-body enclosure, 3
2kT .
So far, Einstein has stated that the radiation ‘behaved as though’ it consisted of a number
of independent particles. Is this just another ‘formal device’? The last sentence of Sect. 6
of his paper leaves the reader in no doubt:
‘the next obvious step is to investigate whether the laws of emission and transformation
of light are also of such a nature that they can be interpreted or explained by considering
light to consist of such energy quanta.’
Einstein considers three phenomena which cannot be explained by classical electromag-
netic theory.
1. Stokes’ rule is the observation that the frequency of photoluminescent emission is less
than the frequency of the incident light. This is explained as a consequence of the
conservation of energy. If the incoming quanta each have energy hν1, the re-emitted
quanta can at most have this energy. If some of the energy of the quanta is absorbed by
the material before re-emission, the emitted quanta of energy hν2 must have hν2 ≤hν1.
2. The photoelectric effect. This is the most famous result of the paper because Einstein
made a deﬁnite quantitative prediction on the basis of the theory expounded above.
Ironically, the photoelectric effect had been discovered by Hertz in 1887 in the same
experiments which fully validated Maxwell’s equations. Perhaps the most remarkable
feature of the effect was L´en´ard’s discovery that the energies of the electrons emitted
from the metal surface are independent of the intensity of the incident radiation (L´en´ard,
1902).
Einstein’s proposal provided an immediate solution to this problem. Radiation of a
given frequency consists of quanta of the same energy hν. If one of these is absorbed
by the material, the electron may receive sufﬁcient energy to remove it from the surface
against the forces which bind it to the material. If the intensity of the light is increased,
more electrons are ejected, but their energies remain unchanged. Einstein wrote this
result in the following form. The maximum kinetic energy which the ejected electron
can have, Ek, is
Ek = hν −W ,
(3.13)
where W is the amount of work necessary to remove the electron from the surface of
the material, the work function of the material. Experiments to estimate the magnitude
of the work function involve placing the photocathode in an opposing potential so that,
when the potential reaches some value V , the ejected electrons can no longer reach the
anode and the photoelectric current falls to zero. This occurs at the potential at which

3.4 The quantum theory of solids
Ek = eV . Therefore,
V = h
e ν −W
e .
(3.14)
In Einstein’s words,
‘If the formula derived is correct, then V must be a straight line function of the
frequency of the incident light, when plotted in Cartesian coordinates, whose slope is
independent of the nature of the substance investigated.’
Thus, the quantity h/e, the ratio of Planck’s constant to the electronic charge, can be
found directly from the slope of this relation. Nothing was known about the dependence
of the photoelectric effect upon the frequency of the incident radiation at that time. It
was only in 1916 that Millikan’s meticulous experiments conﬁrmed precisely Einstein’s
prediction.
3. Photoionisation of gases. The third piece of experimental evidence was the fact that
the energy of each photon has to be greater than the ionisation potential of the gas if
photoionisation is to take place. Einstein showed that the smallest energy quanta for
the ionisation of air were approximately equal to the ionisation potential determined
independently by Stark. Once again, the quantum hypothesis is in agreement with
experiment.
This is the work described in Einstein’s Nobel Prize citation of 1921.
3.4 The quantum theory of solids
In 1905, Einstein was not at all clear that Planck and he were actually describing the same
phenomenon. In 1906, however, he showed that the two approaches were, in fact, the same
(Einstein, 1906b). Then, later in the same year, he came to the same conclusion by a different
argument, and went on to extend the idea of quantisation to solids (Einstein, 1906c).
In the ﬁrst of these papers, Einstein asserts that he and Planck are actually describing the
same phenomena of quantisation.
‘At that time [1905] it seemed to me as though Planck’s theory of radiation formed a
contrast to my work in a certain respect. New considerations which are given in the
ﬁrst section of this paper demonstrate to me, however, that the theoretical foundation on
which Planck’s radiation theory rests differs from the foundation that would result from
Maxwell’s theory and the electron theory and indeed differs exactly in that Planck’s theory
implicitly makes use of the hypothesis of light quanta just mentioned.’ (Einstein, 1906b)
These arguments are developed further in the second paper of 1906. Einstein demon-
strated that, if Planck had followed Boltzmann’s procedures, he would have ended up with
the Boltzmann expression for the probability that a state of energy E = rε is occupied,
even although the limit ε →0 is not taken:
p(E) ∝e−E/kT .

Einstein and quanta 1900–1911
It is assumed that the energy of the oscillator is quantised in units of ε. Thus, if there are
N0 oscillators in the ground state, the number in the r = 1 state is N0 e−ε/kT , in the r = 2
state N0e−2ε/kT , and so on. Therefore, the average energy of the oscillator is
E = N0 × 0 + εN0 e−ε/kT + 2εN0 e−2ε/kT + · · ·
N0 + N0 e−ε/kT + N0 e−2ε/kT + · · ·
= N0ε e−ε/kT

N0

1 + e−ε/kT + (e−ε/kT )2 + · · ·

.
(3.15)
We recall the following series:
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · ;
1
(1 −x)2 = 1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + · · · ,
(3.16)
and hence the mean energy of the oscillator is
E =
ε e−ε/kT
1 −e−ε/kT =
ε
eε/kT −1 .
(3.17)
Thus, using the proper Boltzmann procedure, Planck’s relation for the mean energy of the
oscillator is recovered, provided the energy element ε does not vanish. Einstein’s approach
indicates clearly the origin of the departure from the classical result. The mean energy
E = kT is recovered in the classical limit ε →0 from (3.17). Notice that, by allowing
ε →0, the averaging takes place over a continuum of energies which the oscillator might
take. In that limit, equal volumes of phase space are given equal weights in the averaging
process, and this is the origin of the classical equipartition theorem. Einstein shows that
Planck’s formula requires this assumption to be wrong. Rather, only those volumes of phase
space with energies 0, ε, 2ε, 3ε . . . should have non-zero weights and these should all be
equal.
Einstein then relates this result directly to his previous paper on light quanta:
‘we must assume that for ions which can vibrate at a deﬁnite frequency and which make
possible the exchange of energy between radiation and matter, the manifold of possible
states must be narrower than it is for the bodies in our direct experience. We must in fact
assume that the mechanism of energy transfer is such that the energy can assume only the
values 0, ε, 2ε, 3ε . . .’ (Einstein, 1906c)
But this is only the beginning of the paper. Much more is to follow – Einstein puts it
beautifully.
‘I now believe that we should not be satisﬁed with the result. For the following question
forces itself upon us. If the elementary oscillators that are used in the theory of the energy
exchange between radiation and matter cannot be interpreted in the sense of the present
kinetic molecular theory, must we not also modify the theory for the other oscillators
that are used in the molecular theory of heat? There is no doubt about the answer, in my
opinion. If Planck’s theory of radiation strikes to the heart of the matter, then we must also
expect to ﬁnd contradictions between the present kinetic molecular theory and experiment
in other areas of the theory of heat, contradictions that can be resolved by the route just
traced. In my opinion, this is actually the case, as I try to show in what follows.’ (Einstein,
1906c)

3.4 The quantum theory of solids
The problem discussed by Einstein concerns the heat capacities of solids. According to the
Dulong and Petit law, the heat capacity per mole of a solid is 3R. This result can be derived
simply from the equipartition theorem. The model of the solid consists of NA atoms per
mole and it is supposed that they can all vibrate in the three independent directions, x, y, z.
According to the equipartition theorem, the internal energy per mole of the solid should
therefore be 3NAkT , since each independent mode of vibration is awarded an energy kT .
The heat capacity per mole follows directly by differentiation: C = ∂U/∂T = 3NAk = 3R.
It was known that some materials do not obey the Dulong and Petit law in that they have
signiﬁcantly smaller heat capacities than 3R – this was particularly true for light elements
such as carbon, boron and silicon. In addition, by 1900, it was known that the heat capacities
of some elements change rapidly with temperature and only attain the value 3R at high
temperatures.
The problem is readily solved if Einstein’s quantum hypothesis is adopted. For oscillators,
the classical formula for the average energy of the oscillator kT should be replaced by the
quantum formula
E =
hν
ehν/kT −1 .
Now atoms are complicated systems, but let us suppose for simplicity that, for a particular
material, they all vibrate at the same frequency, the Einstein frequency νE, and that these
vibrations are independent. Since each atom has three independent modes of vibration, the
internal energy is
U = 3NA
hνE
ehνE/kT −1 ,
(3.18)
and the heat capacity is

(ehνE/kT −1)2 .
(3.19)
Einstein compared the experimentally determined variation of the heat capacity of diamond
with his formula with the results shown in Fig. 3.2. The decrease in the heat capacity at low
temperatures is apparent, although the experimental points lie slightly above the predicted
relation at low temperatures.
We can now understand why light elements have smaller heat capacities than the heavier
elements. Presumably, the lighter elements have higher vibrational frequencies than heavier
elements and hence, at a given temperature, νE/T is larger and the heat capacity is smaller.
To account for the experimental data shown in Fig. 3.2, the frequency νE must lie in the
infrared waveband. As a result, all vibrations at higher frequencies make only a vanishingly
small contribution to the heat capacity. As expected, there is strong absorption at infrared
wavelengths corresponding to frequencies ν ≈νE. Einstein compared his estimates of νE
with the strong absorption features observed in a number of materials and found remarkable
agreement, granted the simplicity of the model.

Fig. 3.2
The variation of the heat capacity of diamond with temperature compared with the prediction of Einstein’s quantum
theory. The abscissa is T/θE, where kθE = hνE, and the ordinate the molar heat capacity in calories mole−1. This
diagram appears in Einstein’s paper of 1906 and uses the results of Heinrich Weber which were listed in the tables of
Landolt and B¨ornstein (Einstein, 1906c).
The most important prediction of the theory was that the heat capacities of all solids
should decrease to zero at low temperatures, as indicated in Fig. 3.2. This was of key
importance from the point of view of furthering the acceptance of Einstein’s ideas. At about
this time, Walther Nernst began a series of experiments to measure the heat capacities of
solids at low temperatures. His motivation was to test his heat theorem, or the third law of
thermodynamics, which he had developed theoretically in order to understand the nature of
chemical equilibria. The heat theorem enabled the calculation of chemical equilibria to be
carried out precisely and also led to the prediction that the heat capacities of all materials
should tend to zero at low temperatures. As recounted by Frank Blatt,
‘. . . shortly after Einstein had assumed a junior faculty position at the University of Zurich
[in 1909], Nernst paid the young theorist a visit so that they could discuss problems of
common interest. The chemist George Hevesy . . . recalls that among his colleagues it was
this visit by Nernst that raised Einstein’s reputation. He had come as an unknown man to
Zurich. Then, Nernst came, and the people at Zurich said, “This Einstein must be a clever
fellow, if the great Nernst comes so far from Berlin to Zurich to talk to him.”’ (Blatt,
1992)
3.5 Debye’s theory of specific heats
Einstein took little interest in the heat capacities of solids after 1907 but his ideas on
quantisation were taken signiﬁcantly further by Pieter Debye in an important paper of 1912

3.5 Debye’s theory of specific heats
(Debye, 1912). Einstein was well aware of the fact that the assumption that the atoms of a
solid vibrate independently was a crude approximation. Debye took the opposite approach
of returning to a continuum picture, almost identical to that developed by Rayleigh in his
treatment of the spectrum of black-body radiation (Sect. 2.3.4). Debye realised that the
collective modes of vibration of the solid could be represented by the complete set of
normal modes which follows from ﬁtting waves into a box, as described by Rayleigh. Each
independent mode of oscillation of a solid as a whole should be awarded an energy
E =
¯hω
exp(¯hω/kT ) −1 ,
(3.20)
according to Einstein’s prescription, where ω is the angular frequency of vibration of the
mode. The number of modes N had been evaluated by Rayleigh according to the procedure
described in Sect. 2.3.4 and was shown to be
dN = L3ω2
2π2c3s
dω ,
(3.21)
where cs is the speed of propagation of the waves in the material. Just as in the case of
electromagnetic radiation, we need to determine the number of independent polarisation
states for the wave modes. In this case, there are two transverse modes and one longitudinal
mode, corresponding to the independent directions in which the material can be stressed by
the wave, and so in total there are 3 dN modes, each of which is awarded the energy (3.20).
Debye makes the assumption that these modes have the same speed of propagation and that
it is independent of the frequency of the modes. Therefore, the total internal energy of the
material is

(3.22)
where x = ¯hω/kT .
The problem is now to determine the value of xmax. Debye introduced the idea that
there must be a limit to the total number of modes in which energy could be stored. In
the high temperature limit, he argued that the total energy should not exceed that given
by the classical equipartition theorem, namely 3NkT . Since each mode of oscillation has
energy kT in this limit, there should be a maximum of 3N modes in which energy is
stored. Therefore, recalling that there are 3N modes, Debye’s condition can be found by
integrating (3.21)

It is conventional to write xmax = ¯hωmax/kT = θD/T , where θD is known as the Debye
temperature. Therefore, the expression for the total internal energy of the material (3.22)

This integral cannot be written in closed form, but it provides a better ﬁt to the data on
the heat capacity of solids than Einstein’s expression (3.19). This is particularly true for
the data at low temperatures. If T ≪θD, the upper limit to the integral in (3.25) can be
set to inﬁnity, and then the integral has the value 4π4/15. Therefore, at low temperatures
T ≪θD, the heat capacity depends upon temperature as

Rather than decreasing exponentially at low temperatures, the heat capacity varies as T 3.

for one mole of the solid, where NA is Avogadro’s number. But L/N 1/3

is just the typical
interatomic spacing, a. Therefore, (3.27) states that νmax ≈cs/a, that is, the minimum
wavelength of the waves λmin = cs/νmax ≈a. This makes a great deal of sense physically.
On scales less than the interatomic spacing a, the concept of collective vibration of the
atoms of the material ceases to have any meaning.
3.6 Fluctuations of particles and waves – Einstein (1909)
Einstein’s startling new ideas on light quanta did not gain immediate acceptance by the
scientiﬁc community at large. Most of the major ﬁgures in physics rejected the idea that
light could be considered to be made up of discrete quanta. In a letter to Einstein of 1907,
Planck wrote:
‘I look for the signiﬁcance of the elementary quantum of action (light quantum) not in
vacuo but rather at points of absorption and emission and assume that processes in vacuo
are accurately described by Maxwell’s equations. At least, I do not yet ﬁnd a compelling
reason for giving up this assumption which for the time being seems to be the simplest.’
(Planck, 1907)

3.6 Fluctuations of particles and waves
Planck continued to reject the light quantum hypothesis as late as 1913. In 1909, Lorentz,
who was generally regarded as the leading theoretical physicist in Europe, and whom
Einstein held in the highest esteem, wrote:
‘While I no longer doubt that the correct radiation formula can only be reached by
way of Planck’s hypothesis of energy elements, I consider it highly unlikely that these
energy elements should be considered as light quanta which maintain their identity during
propagation.’ (Lorentz, 1909)
Einstein never deviated from his conviction concerning the reality of quanta and con-
tinued to ﬁnd other ways in which the experimental features of black-body radiation lead
inevitably to the conclusion that light consists of quanta. In one of his most impressive pa-
pers written in 1909, he showed how ﬂuctuations in the intensity of the black-body radiation
spectrum provide further evidence for the quantum nature of light (Einstein, 1909). Notice
how the theme of ﬂuctuations and stochastic processes keeps reappearing in Einstein’s
physical understanding. I have given a detailed treatment of the theory of ﬂuctuations in
the number densities of particles and waves in Sects. 15.2.1 and 15.2.2 of TCP2. Here the
results of these calculations are summarised.
3.6.1 Particles in a box
A box is divided into N equal cells and a large number of particles n is distributed randomly
among them. If n is very large, the mean number of particles in each cell is roughly the
same, but there is a real scatter about the mean value because of statistical ﬂuctuations.
Suppose p is the probability of a single cell being occupied and q the probability that it
is not occupied so that p + q = 1. The probability distribution can be worked out exactly
using permutation theory and then converted to a continuous distribution. The result is a
normal, or Gaussian, distribution p(x) dx, which can be written
p(x) dx =
1
(2πσ 2)1/2 exp

−x2
2σ 2

dx
(3.28)
where σ 2 = npq is the variance; x is measured with respect to the mean value np. If the box
is divided into N cells, the probability of a particle being in a single cell in one experiment
is p = 1/N, q = (1 −1/N). The total number of particles is n. Therefore, the average
number of particles per sub-box is n/N and the variance about this mean value, that is, the
mean squared statistical ﬂuctuation about the mean, is
σ 2 = n
N

1 −1
N

.
(3.29)
If N is large, σ 2 = n/N and is the average number of particles in each cell, that is,
σ = (n/N)1/2. This is the well-known result that, for large values of N, the mean is equal
to the variance. This is the origin of the useful rule that the fractional ﬂuctuation about the
average value is 1/M1/2 where M is the number of discrete objects counted.

3.6.2 Fluctuations of randomly superposed waves
The random superposition of waves is different in important ways. Suppose the electric ﬁeld
E at some point in space is the random superposition of the electric ﬁelds from N sources,
where N is very large. For simplicity, we consider only propagation in the z-direction and
only one of the two linear polarisations of the waves, Ex or Ey. We also assume that the
frequencies ν and the amplitudes ξ of all the waves are the same, the only difference being
their random phases. Then, the quantity E∗
x Ex = |E|2 is proportional to the Poynting vector
ﬂux density in the z-direction for the Ex component and so is proportional to the energy
density of the radiation, where E∗
x is the complex conjugate of Ex. Since the phases of the
waves are random,
⟨E∗
x Ex⟩= Nξ 2 ∝ux .
(3.30)
This is a familiar result. For incoherent radiation, meaning for waves with random phases,
the total energy density is equal to the sum of the energies in all the waves.
A similar calculation can be carried out for the ﬂuctuations in the average energy density
of the waves. We work out the quantity ⟨(E∗
x Ex)2⟩with respect to the mean value (3.30).
Recalling that ⟨n2⟩= ⟨n2⟩−⟨n⟩2,
u2
x ∝⟨(E∗
x Ex)2⟩−⟨E∗
x Ex⟩2 .
(3.31)
As shown in Sect. 15.2.2 of TCP2,
u2
x = u2
x ,
(3.32)
that is, the ﬂuctuations in the energy density are of the same magnitude as the energy density
of the radiation ﬁeld itself. Despite the fact that the radiation measured by a detector is a
superposition of a large number of waves with random phases, the ﬂuctuations in the ﬁelds
are as large as the magnitude of the total intensity. The physical meaning of this calculation
is clear. Every pair of waves of frequency ν interferes to produce ﬂuctuations in intensity
of the radiation u ≈u. Notice that this analysis refers to waves of random phase φ and of
a particular angular frequency ω, that is, what we would refer to as waves corresponding to
a single mode.
3.6.3 Fluctuations in black-body radiation
Einstein begins his paper of 1909 by reversing Boltzmann’s relation between entropy and
probability:
W = eS/k .
(3.33)
Consider the radiation in the frequency interval ν to ν + dν. As before, we write ε =
V u(ν) dν. Now divide the volume into a large number of cells and suppose that εi is the
ﬂuctuation in the ith cell. Then the entropy of this cell is

Einstein noted that the two terms on the right-hand side have quite speciﬁc meanings.
The ﬁrst term originates from the Wien part of the spectrum and, if we suppose the radiation
consists of photons, each of energy hν, it corresponds to the statement that the fractional
ﬂuctuation in the intensity is just 1/N 1/2 where N is the number of photons, that is,
N/N = 1/N 1/2 .

Einstein and quanta 1900–1911
According to the considerations of Sect. 3.6.1, this is exactly the result expected if light
consists of discrete particles.
Let us now look more closely at the second term. It originates from the Rayleigh–
Jeans part of the spectrum. We ask, ‘How many independent modes are there in the box
in the frequency range ν to ν + dν?’ We have already shown in Sect. 2.3.4 that there
are 8πν2V dν/c3 modes (see (2.24) et seq.). We have also shown in Sect. 3.6.2 that the
ﬂuctuations associated with each wave mode have magnitude ε2 = ε2. When we add
together randomly all the independent modes in the frequency interval ν to ν + dν, we add
their variances and hence
⟨δE2⟩

8πν2V dν ,
which is exactly the same as the second term on the right-hand side of (3.41).
Thus, the two parts of the ﬂuctuation spectrum correspond to particle and wave statistics,
the former corresponding to the Wien part of the spectrum and the latter to the Rayleigh–
Jeans part. The amazing aspect of this formula for the ﬂuctuations is that we recall that we
add together the variances due to independent causes and the equation
σ 2
ε2 =
hν

c3


(3.43)
states that we should add independently the variances of the ‘wave’ and ‘particle’ ﬂuctua-
tions of the radiation ﬁeld to ﬁnd the total magnitude of the ﬂuctuations. This remarkable
expression was to have long-term resonances in the struggles to interpret quantum mechan-
ics once the theory reached its deﬁnitive form in the late 1920s.
3.7 The First Solvay Conference
Among those who were persuaded of the importance of quanta was Walther Nernst, who
at that time was measuring the low temperature heat capacities of various materials. As
recounted in Sect. 3.4, Nernst visited Einstein in Zurich in March 1910 and they compared
Einstein’s theory with his recent experiments. These experiments showed that Einstein’s
predictions of the low temperature variation of the speciﬁc heat with temperature (3.19)
gave a good description of the experimental results. As Einstein wrote to his friend Jakob
Laub after the visit,
‘I consider the quantum theory certain. My predictions with respect to speciﬁc heats
seem to be strikingly conﬁrmed. Nernst, who has just been here, and Rubens are eagerly
occupied with experimental tests, so that people will soon be informed about this matter.’
(Einstein, 1910)
By 1911, Nernst was convinced, not only of the importance of Einstein’s results, but also of
the theory underlying them. The outcome of the meeting with Einstein was dramatic. The
number of papers on quanta began to increase rapidly, as Nernst popularised the results of
the quantum theory of solids.

right standing: Goldschmidt, Planck, Rubens, Sommerfeld, Lindemann, de Broglie, Knudsen, Hasen¨ohrl, Hostelet,
Herzen, Jeans, Rutherford, Onnes, Einstein, Langevin.
Nernst was a friend of the wealthy Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay and he persuaded
him to sponsor a meeting of a select group of physicists to discuss the issues of quanta and
radiation. The idea was ﬁrst mooted in 1910, but Planck urged that the meeting should be
postponed for a year. As he wrote,
‘My experience leads me to the opinion that scarcely half of those you envisage as
participants have a sufﬁciently lively conviction of the pressing need for reform to be
motivated to attend the conference . . . Of the entire list you name, I believe that besides
ourselves [only] Einstein, Lorentz, W. Wien and Larmor are deeply interested in the topic.’
(Planck, 1910)
By the following year, matters were very different. Debye, Haas, Hasen¨ohrl, Schidlof, Weiss
and Wilson had published papers on the quantum hypothesis.
The eighteen ofﬁcial participants met on 29 October 1911 in the Hotel Metropole in
Brussels and the meeting took place between the 30th of that month and 3 November
(Fig. 3.3). By this time, the majority of the participants took the quantum hypothesis
seriously. Two of them were against quanta – Jeans and Poincar´e. Five were initially
neutral – Rutherford, Brillouin, Skłodowska-Curie, Perrin, Knudsen. The eleven others were
basically pro-quanta – Lorentz (chairman), Nernst, Planck, Rubens, Sommerfeld, Wien,
Warburg, Langevin, Einstein, Hasen¨ohrl and Onnes. The secretaries were Goldschmidt,
de Broglie and Lindemann; Solvay, who hosted the conference, was there, as well as his

collaborators Herzen and Hostelet. The physicists who took a neutral position had done so
because they were unfamiliar with the arguments.
The conference had a profound effect in that it provided a forum at which all the arguments
could be presented. In addition, all the participants wrote their lectures for publication
beforehand and these were then discussed in detail. These discussions were recorded and
the full proceedings published within a year of the event in the important volume La Th´eorie
du rayonnement et les quanta: Rapports et discussions de la r´eunion tenue `a Bruxelles, du
30 octobre au 3 novembre 1911 (Langevin and De Broglie, 1912) Thus, all the important
issues were made available to the scientiﬁc community in one volume. As a result, the next
generation of students became fully familiar with the arguments and many of them set to
work immediately to tackle the problems of quanta. Furthermore, these problems began to
be appreciated beyond the central European German-speaking scientiﬁc community.
A particularly signiﬁcant convert was Poincar´e who immediately tackled the issue of
whether or not the introduction of what he called ‘discontinuities’ were essential in order
to understand the spectrum of black-body radiation. In his detailed analysis of the problem,
he came to the conclusion that if w(ε) is the probability density of Planck’s resonators, the
measured spectrum in the Wien region could only be accounted for if the function was a
discontinuous function of the energy ε (Poincar´e, 1912). It had to be zero for all values
of ε except ε = 0, hν, 2hν, 3hν. . . . Poincar´e’s paper was so compelling that even Jeans
conceded that he had to accept the quantum hypothesis in its entirety.
It would be wrong, however, to believe that everyone was suddenly convinced of the
existence of quanta. In his paper of 1916 on his famous series of experiments in which
he veriﬁed the dependence of the photoelectric effect upon frequency (Fig. 3.4), Millikan
stated:

3.8 The end of the beginning
‘We are confronted however by the astonishing situation that these facts were correctly
and exactly predicted nine years ago by a form of quantum theory which has now been
generally abandoned.’ (Millikan, 1916)
Millikan refers to Einstein’s ‘bold, not to say reckless, hypothesis of an electromagnetic
light corpuscle of energy hν which ﬂies in the face of the thoroughly established facts of
interference.’ (Millikan, 1916).
3.8 The end of the beginning
The 1911 Solvay Conference is a convenient point at which to conclude the introduction
to the history of quantum mechanics. The essential role of quanta and the fundamental
signiﬁcance of Planck’s constant h could not be ignored. At the same time, something had
gone spectacularly wrong with classical physics, but it was far from clear what was to
replace it. The remarkable analyses of Planck and Einstein had shown that oscillators and
radiation are quantised, but how did it all ﬁt together?
The next phase from 1911 to 1924 I have designated the era of the old quantum theory
during which many of the pieces began to fall into place and which were eventually to be
subsumed into the full theory of quantum mechanics, but the old theory was doomed to
failure. Nonetheless, these endeavours uncovered many of the essential features of quantum
processes which were only to be rationalised within the context of quantum mechanics
during the dramatic years from 1925 to 1930.

The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
Following the success of the 1911 Solvay Conference and the rapid dissemination of the
proceedings, the emphasis of research shifted towards the understanding of the spectra
of atoms and molecules. With the availability of precision spectroscopic techniques, the
bewildering variety of spectral features of atoms and molecules became apparent. The
efforts described in Sect. 1.6 indicate how regularities were found in the patterns of spectral
lines, the culmination of these investigations being the discovery of the formula for the
Balmer series and the various formulae to account for the principal, diffuse and sharp series
of the lines in the spectra of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and zinc. As Planck
remarked in 1902,
‘If the question concerning the nature of white light may thus be regarded as being solved,
the answer to the closely related but no less important question – the question concerning
the nature of light of the spectral lines – seems to belong among the most difﬁcult and
complicated problems, which have ever been posed in optics or electrodynamics.’ (Planck,
1902)
4.1 The Zeeman effect: Lorentz and Larmor’s interpretations
In 1862, Faraday attempted to measure the change in wavelength of spectral lines when
the source of the lines was placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, but failed to observe any
positive effect (Jones, 1870). Inspired by this negative result, Pieter Zeeman repeated the
experiment and discovered the broadening of the D lines of sodium when a sodium ﬂame
was placed between the poles of a strong electromagnet (Zeeman, 1896a). Zeeman used
a high quality Rowland grating with a radius of 10 feet and 14 938 lines per inch but the
10 kG produced by the magnet was insufﬁcient to resolve the broadened lines (Fig. 4.1). By
the end of October 1896, Zeeman was convinced that the broadening of the spectral lines
was a real effect, the broadening being proportional to the applied magnetic ﬂux density,
and his paper was presented on Saturday 31 October 1896 to the Science Section of the
Dutch Academy of Sciences. Over that same weekend, Lorentz interpreted this result in
terms of the splitting of spectral lines due to the motion of the ‘ions’ in the atoms in the
magnetic ﬁeld.
Lorentz had derived the correct expression for the force acting on a charge in combined
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in 1892, the Lorentz force,
F = e(E + v × B) ,

where E is the electric ﬁeld strength and B is the magnetic ﬂux density (Lorentz, 1892b).
Lorentz carried out the following calculation.1 It is supposed that the emission line is due
to the vibration of oscillators within the atoms of the material, each characterised by a mass
m and a spring constant k. In the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the z-direction,
the equations of motion of the oscillator under the inﬂuence of the Lorentz force can be
written,
m d2x

dt ,

The solution of (4.4) is z = a cos(ω0t + p) where a and p are constants and ω0 is the
angular frequency of the oscillator, ω0 = 2πν0 = √k/m. Lorentz found the following two
solutions for motion in the x- and y-directions:
x = a1 cos(ω1t + p1) ;
y = −a1 sin(ω1t + p1) ,
(4.5)
and
x = a2 cos(ω2t + p2) ;
y = a2 sin(ω2t + p2) ,

or
ν0 = ± eB
4πm .
(4.8)
This analysis made deﬁnite predictions about the polarisation of the broadened lines. First of
all, inspection of (4.5) and (4.6) shows that these motions correspond to circular motion in
opposite senses about the magnetic ﬁeld direction. Therefore, as viewed along the magnetic
ﬁeld direction, the radiation of the ‘ions’ should be circularly polarised in opposite senses on
either side of the unperturbed frequency ν0. Along this direction there should be no emission
at ν0 because the acceleration is along the line of sight.2 On the other hand, when viewed
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld direction, all three components should be observed.
They are all linearly polarised, the central frequency component being polarised parallel
to the ﬁeld direction and the displaced components perpendicular to the ﬁeld direction.
Zeeman continued his careful measurements over the next two months and discovered that
the polarisation properties of the broadened lines agreed with these expectations (Zeeman,
1896b). Several months later, the splitting of the blue cadmium line into separate lines
was observed (Zeeman, 1897). For observations along the magnetic ﬁeld direction two
components were observed, while triplets were observed for measurements perpendicular
to it.
Furthermore, according to (4.8), the splitting of the line depends upon the ratio e/m and
so the broadening of the line enables this ratio to be found for the ‘ions’ responsible for the
emission lines. Lorentz found a lower limit of 1000 for the value of e/me relative to that
of the hydrogen ion. This came as a surprise to Lorentz and his colleagues since the ions
responsible for electrolytic phenomena had values of e/m similar to that of the hydrogen
ion. The Zeeman effect thus provided a means of studying the internal structure of atoms.
At about the same time, an alternative approach to the splitting of spectral lines was
proposed by Joseph Larmor (Larmor, 1897). In the simplest case, consider a charged
particle of mass m and electric charge e moving in a circular orbit. There is an electric
current associated with this motion resulting in a magnetic moment μ which is related to
the angular momentum of the particle L by the classical relation μ = (e/2m)L. Suppose
the axis of the magnetic dipole of the orbit is at an angle θ with respect to the magnetic
ﬁeld direction B. Then, there is a torque acting on the orbiting electron, the magnitude and
direction of the torque being given by the vector relation  = μ × B. The action of the
torque causes the angular momentum vector to precess about the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld in the azimuthal φ direction since
 = dL
dt .

|L| sin θ = |μ||B| sin θ

(4.10)
This is exactly the same formula as derived by Lorentz. Thus, there were two ‘ion’ pictures
involving the magnetic ﬁeld – either the splitting was associated with the effect of the
magnetic ﬁeld upon a linear oscillator or with the precessional motion of an orbiting
charge.
These discoveries gave signiﬁcant insights into the physics of atoms, but the picture
was soon clouded by the discoveries of Michelson (1897) and Preston (1898) that the
spectral lines of atoms could be split into four, six or more components. These results were
inconsistent with the Lorentz picture which became known as the normal Zeeman effect.
The higher order splittings were referred to as the anomalous Zeeman effect, the explanation
of which was at least 20 years in the future.
4.2 The problems of building models of atoms
By 1900, the existence of the electron was clearly established through the discovery of
the Zeeman effect and the values of e/m determined from the discharge tube experiments
of Thomson, Wiechert and Kaufmann described in Sect. 2.2.3. As Planck noted above,
however, the problems of constructing models of atoms were formidable. Heilbron (1977)
conveniently lists six basic questions which faced the model builders.
r The nature of the positive charge necessary to create electrically neutral atoms. Was
charge neutrality provided by an equal number of positively charged electrons or by
some other distribution of positive charge?
r The number of electrons in the atom was uncertain. From their charge-to-mass ratio,
there could be thousands of electrons in the atom and that was perhaps not unreasonable
in view of the large numbers of spectral lines observed in atomic spectra. Even the
lightest elements have large numbers of spectral lines while several thousands of lines
are observed in the spectrum of iron.
r There is nothing in classical physics which could establish a natural length-scale for
atoms. A clue was at hand with the introduction of Planck’s constant h in his epochal paper
of 1900, but it was over a decade before Bohr showed how the concept of quantisation
could be applied to determine the size of the hydrogen atom.
r The problem of the collapse of the atom due to the radiation of electromagnetic radiation
by the orbiting electrons was a major stumbling block for atomic theorists. As we will
see in Sect. 4.3.2, there are ways of minimising the problem, but these were to prove
inadequate.
r Even if these problems could be overcome, there was still the problem of understanding
the origin of the various formulae for the spectral lines discussed in Sect. 1.6.

75
4.3 Thomson and Rutherford
r Finally, there remained the fundamental problem of understanding the nature of the
oscillators responsible for the observation of spectral lines.
These issues were to be addressed by a combination of experiment and theory over the
following decade, the pieces of the jigsaw gradually falling into place. Two of the problems
were to ﬁnd deﬁnitive solutions through the experiments of Thomson and Rutherford.
4.3 Thomson and Rutherford
4.3.1 Thomson and the numbers of electrons in atoms
In 1906, Thomson published his analysis of three different ways of estimating the number of
electrons in atoms (Thomson, 1906). His model of the atom involved a swarm of electrons
within a neutralising sphere of positive charge. The ﬁrst approach involved working out
the dispersion of light of different frequencies when it passes through a gas. He applied
the method successfully to hydrogen and found that the number of electrons had to be
approximately equal to the atomic mass number A = 1.
The second approach involved the scattering of X-rays by electrons. X-rays are scattered
by the electrons in atoms by Thomson scattering, the theory of which was worked out
by Thomson using the classical expression for the radiation of an accelerated electron
(Thomson, 1907). It is straightforward to show that the cross-section for the scattering of a
beam of incident radiation by an electron is
σT =
e4
6πϵ2
0m2ec4 = 8πr2
e
3
= 6.653 × 10−29 m2 ,
(4.11)
the Thomson cross-section, where re = e2/4πϵ0mec2 is the classical electron radius.3 In his
model of the atom, it was assumed that the ‘corpuscles’ behave like free electrons – notice
that the Thomson cross-section is independent of the frequency of the incident radiation.
As Thomson states in his paper,
‘Barkla has shown that in the case of gases the energy in the scattered radiation always
bears, for the same gas, a constant ratio to the energy in the primary whatever be the nature
of the rays, that is, whether they are hard or soft; and secondly, that the scattered energy
is proportional to the mass of the gas. The ﬁrst of these results is a conﬁrmation of the
theory, as the ratio of the energy scattered to that in the primary rays . . . is independent
of the nature of the rays; the second result shows that the number of corpuscles per cubic
centimetre is proportional to the mass of the gas: from this it follows that the number
of corpuscles in an atom is proportional to the mass of the atom, that is, to the atomic
weight.’
For a beam of X-rays passing through air, Barkla had measured the scattered fraction of
the X-ray intensity to be 2.4 × 10−4 cm−3 and consequently that there should be about
25 corpuscles per air molecule, roughly equal to the atomic mass number A of the air
molecules.

76
The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
The third approach involved the scattering of β-rays by matter. Thomson derived the
formula for what was called ‘multiple-scattering theory’, the energy loss due to multiple
electrostatic interactions between the fast electron and the electrons in atoms – this process
is also known as ionisation losses in the context of the interactions of electrons with atoms.4
Using estimates by Rutherford for the mean free path of β-rays, Thomson again found the
result n ∼A. The conclusion of his paper was dramatic – most of the mass of atoms could
not be due to the negatively charged electrons but must reside in the positive charge which
held the atoms together. The X-ray experiments were continued by Barkla who showed
that in fact, except for hydrogen, the number of electrons is roughly half the atomic weight
n ≈A/2 (Barkla, 1911a).
4.3.2 The radiative and mechanical instability of atoms
The construction of atomic models was a major industry in the early years of the twentieth
century, particularly in England, and has been splendidly surveyed by Heilbron (1977). A
key question was, ‘How are the electrons and the positive charge distributed inside atoms?’
However they are distributed, they cannot be stationary because of Earnshaw’s theorem,
which states that any static distribution of electric charges is mechanically unstable, in
that they either collapse or disperse to inﬁnity under the action of electrostatic forces. The
alternative is to place the electrons in orbits, what is often called the ‘Saturnian’ model of
the atom, as advocated by Perrin (1901) and Nagaoka (1904a,b). Nagaoka was inspired by
Maxwell’s model for Saturn’s rings and attempted to associate the spectral lines of atoms
with small vibrational perturbations of the electrons about their equilibrium orbits.
A major problem with the Saturnian pictures was the radiative instability of the electron.
Suppose the electron has a circular orbit of radius a. Then, equating the centripetal force
to the electrostatic force of attraction between the electron and the nucleus of charge Ze,
Ze2
4πϵ0a2 = mev2
a
= me|¨r| ,
(4.12)
where |¨r| is the centripetal acceleration. The rate at which the electron loses energy by
radiation is given by (2.1). The kinetic energy of the electron is E = 1
2mev2 = 1
2mea|¨r|.
Therefore, the time it takes the electron to lose all its kinetic energy by radiation is
T =
E
|dE/dt| = 2πa3
σTc .
(4.13)
Taking the radius of the atom to be a = 10−10 m, the time it takes the electron to lose
all its energy is about 3 × 10−10 s. Something is profoundly wrong. As the electron loses
energy, it moves into an orbit of smaller radius, loses energy more rapidly and spirals into
the nucleus.
The pioneer atom model builders were well aware of this problem. Fortunately, the
wavelength of light λ is very much greater than the size of atoms a and so the solution
was to place the electrons in orbits such that there would be no net acceleration when
the acceleration vectors of all the electrons in the atom are added together. This requires,

4.3 Thomson and Rutherford
there are two electrons in the atom, they can be placed in the same circular orbit on opposite
sides of the nucleus and so, to ﬁrst order, there is no net dipole moment as observed
at inﬁnity, and hence no dipole radiation. There is, however, a ﬁnite electric quadrupole
moment and hence radiation at the level (λ/a)2, relative to the intensity of dipole radiation,
is expected. Since λ/a ∼10−3, the radiation problem can be signiﬁcantly relieved. By
adding more electrons to the orbit, the quadrupole moment can be cancelled out as well
and so, by adding sufﬁcient electrons to each orbit, the radiation problem can be reduced
to manageable proportions. Thus, before Thomson’s paper of 1906, the radiative instability
could be overcome by assuming that a huge number of electrons were so disposed as to
result in no net multipole moments of the electron distribution. Each orbit had to be densely
populated with a well-ordered system of large numbers of electrons. This was the basis of
Thomson’s ‘plum-pudding’ model in which the well-ordered orbits were embedded in a
sphere of positive charge. Thomson’s result of 1906 that the numbers of electrons in atoms
is of the same order as the atomic mass number meant that this problem could no longer be
ignored. The radiative problem was particularly severe for hydrogen, which possesses only
one electron.
The other problem with the Saturnian picture of Nagaoka was its mechanical instability.
Nagaoka had been inspired by Maxwell’s model of Saturn’s rings in which stable oscillations
were found when rings of particles were perturbed. He attempted to associate the spectral
lines of atoms with these oscillations. In Maxwell’s case the perturbations were stable under
the attractive force of gravity between particles of the ring, but in the case of the repulsive
electrostatic forces between electrons, the perturbations were unstable. This mechanical
instability was inevitable, even if the radiative instability could be eliminated.
4.3.3 Rutherford, α-particles and the discovery of the atomic nucleus
The nature of β-rays as electrons was quickly assimilated into the armoury of the physicist,
but what about the nature of the α-particles? In 1902, while Rutherford was at McGill
University in Canada, he showed that the α-particles were deﬂected by electric and magnetic
ﬁelds and that their value of e/m was roughly that of the charge-to-mass ratio of hydrogen
ions (Rutherford, 1903). Rutherford took up the Langworthy Professorship of Physics at
Manchester University in 1907 and, in the following year, demonstrated convincingly that
α-particles are helium nuclei (Rutherford and Royds, 1909). A source of α-particles was
inserted into a ﬁne glass tube which could be inserted into an evacuated discharge tube.
Before this ‘needle’ was inserted, when a high voltage was maintained across the discharge
tube, no evidence for helium was observed. Once the needle was inserted into the tube,
the α-particles passed through the thin walls of the glass tube, which were only 0.01 mm
in thickness, and the characteristic lines of helium were observed in the discharge tube
(Fig. 4.2). This was convincing evidence that α-particles are the nuclei of helium atoms.
The discovery of the nuclear structure of atoms resulted from a brilliant series of exper-
iments carried out by Rutherford and his colleagues, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, in
the period 1909–1912. Rutherford had been impressed by the fact that α-particles could
pass through thin ﬁlms rather easily, suggesting that much of the volume of atoms is empty
space, although there was clear evidence for small-angle scattering. Rutherford persuaded

Marsden, who was still an undergraduate, to investigate whether or not α-particles were
deﬂected through large angles on being ﬁred at a thin gold foil target. To Rutherford’s
astonishment, a few particles were deﬂected by more than 90◦, and a very small number
almost returned along the direction of incidence. In Rutherford’s words:
‘It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was
almost as incredible as if you ﬁred a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came
back and hit you.’ (Andrade, 1964)
Rutherford realised that it required a very considerable force to send the α-particle back
along its track. In 1911 he hit upon the idea that, if all the positive charge were concentrated
in a compact nucleus, the scattering could be attributed to the repulsive electrostatic force
between the incoming α-particle and the positive nucleus. Rutherford was no theorist, but
he used his knowledge of central orbits in inverse-square law ﬁelds of force to work out the
properties of what became known as Rutherford scattering5 (Rutherford, 1911). The orbit

the observed distribution of scattering angles of the α-particles (Geiger and Marsden, 1913).
Rutherford had, however, achieved much more. The fact that the scattering law was
obeyed so precisely, even for large angles of scattering, meant that the inverse-square law
of electrostatic repulsion held good to very small distances indeed. They found that the
nucleus had to have size less than about 10−14 m, very much less than the sizes of atoms,
which are typically about 10−10 m.
Rutherford attended the First Solvay Conference in 1911, but made no mention of his
remarkable experiments, which led directly to his nuclear model of the atom. Remarkably,
this key result for understanding the nature of atoms made little impact upon the physics
community at the time and it was not until 1914 that Rutherford was thoroughly convinced
of the necessity of adopting his nuclear model of the atom. Before that time, however,
someone else did – Niels Bohr, the ﬁrst theorist to apply successfully quantum concepts to
the structure of atoms.
4.4 Haas’s and Nicholson’s models of atoms
Bohr was not, however, the ﬁrst physicist to attempt to introduce quantum concepts into
the construction of atomic models. In 1910, a Viennese doctoral student, Arthur Erich
Haas, realised that, if Thomson’s sphere of positive charge were uniform, an electron would
perform simple harmonic motion through the centre of the sphere, since the restoring force
at radius r from the centre would be, according to Gauss’s theorem in electrostatics,

Haas argued that the energy of oscillation of the electron, E = e2/4πϵ0a, should be quan-
tised and set equal to hν. Therefore,
h2 = πmee2a

.
(4.18)
Haas used (4.18) to show how Planck’s constant could be related to the properties of atoms,
taking for ν the short wavelength limit of the Balmer series, that is, allowing m →∞in
the Balmer formula (1.17) (Haas, 1910a,b,c). Haas’s efforts were discussed by Lorentz at
the 1911 Solvay Conference, but they did not attract much attention. According to Haas’s
approach, Planck’s constant was simply a property of atoms as described by (4.18), whereas
those already converted to quanta preferred to believe that h had much deeper signiﬁcance.
The next clue was provided by the work of the Cambridge physicist John William
Nicholson, who arrived at the concept of the quantisation of angular momentum. Nicholson
(1911, 1912) had shown that, although the Saturnian model of the atom is unstable for
perturbations in the plane of the orbit, perturbations perpendicular to the plane are stable
for orbits containing up to ﬁve electrons – he assumed that the unstable modes in the
plane of the orbit were suppressed by some unspeciﬁed mechanism. The frequencies of
the stable oscillations were multiples of the orbital frequency and he compared these with
the frequencies of the lines observed in the spectra of bright nebulae, particularly with
the ‘nebulium’ and ‘coronium’ lines. Performing the same exercise for ionised atoms with
one less orbiting electron, further matches to the astronomical spectra were obtained. The
frequency of the orbiting electrons remained a free parameter, but when he worked out
the angular momentum associated with them, Nicolson found that they turned out to be
multiples of h/2π. When Bohr returned to Copenhagen from England in 1912, he was
perplexed by the success of Nicholson’s model, which seemed to provide a successful,
quantitative model for the structure of atoms and which could account for the spectral lines
observed in astronomical spectra.
4.5 The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
Niels Bohr completed his doctorate on the electron theory of metals in 1911. Even at that
stage, he had convinced himself that this theory was seriously incomplete and required
further mechanical constraints on the motion of electrons at the microscopic level. He spent
the following year in England, working for seven months with Thomson at the Cavendish
Laboratory in Cambridge, and four months with Rutherford in Manchester. Bohr was
immediately struck by the signiﬁcance of Rutherford’s model of the nuclear structure of the
atom and began to devote all his energies to understanding atomic structure on that basis.
He quickly appreciated the distinction between the chemical properties of atoms, which
are associated with the orbiting electrons, and radioactive processes which are associated
with activity in the nucleus. On this basis, he could understand the nature of the isotopes
of a particular chemical species. Bohr also realised from the outset that the structure of
atoms could not be understood on the basis of classical physics. The obvious way forward

4.5 The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
was to incorporate the quantum concepts of Planck and Einstein into the models of atoms.
Einstein’s statement, quoted in Sect. 3.4,
‘. . . for ions which can vibrate with a deﬁnite frequency, . . . the manifold of possible states
must be narrower than it is for bodies in our direct experience.’ (Einstein, 1906c)
was precisely the type of constraint which Bohr was seeking. Such a mechanical con-
straint was essential to understand how atoms could survive the inevitable instabilities
according to classical physics. How could these ideas be incorporated into models of
atoms?
In the summer of 1912, Bohr wrote an unpublished memorandum for Rutherford, in
which he made his ﬁrst attempt at quantising the energy levels of the electrons in atoms
(Bohr, 1912). He proposed relating the kinetic energy T of the electron to the frequency
ν′ = v/2πa of its orbit about the nucleus through the relation
T = 1
2mev2 = Kν′ ,
(4.19)
where K is a constant which he expected would be of the same order of magnitude as
Planck’s constant h. Bohr believed there must be some such non-classical constraint in
order to guarantee the stability of atoms. Indeed, his criterion (4.19) absolutely ﬁxed the
kinetic energy of the electron about the nucleus. For a bound circular orbit,
mv2

4πϵ0a2 ,
(4.20)
where Z is the positive charge of the nucleus in units of the charge of the electron e. As is
well known, the binding energy of the electron is
E = T + U = 1
2mev2 −
Ze2
4πϵ0a = −Ze2
8πϵ0a = −T = U
2 ,
(4.21)
where U is the electrostatic potential energy. The quantisation condition (4.19) enables
both v and a to be eliminated from the expression for the kinetic energy of the electron. A
straightforward calculation shows that
T = mZ2e4
32ϵ2
0 K 2 ,
(4.22)
which was to prove to be of central signiﬁcance for Bohr. His memorandum containing
these ideas was principally about issues such as the number of electrons in atoms, atomic
volumes, radioactivity, the structure and binding of diatomic molecules and so on. There
is no mention of spectroscopy, which he and Thomson considered too complex to provide
useful information.
The breakthrough came in early 1913, when Hans Marius Hansen told Bohr about the
Balmer formula for the wavelengths, or frequencies, of the spectral lines in the spectrum
of hydrogen,

82
The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
where R∞= 1.097 × 107 m−1 is the Rydberg constant and n = 3, 4, 5, . . . As Bohr recalled
much later,
‘As soon as I saw Balmer’s formula, the whole thing was clear to me.’ (Bohr, 1963)
He realised immediately that this formula contained within it the crucial clue for the
construction of a model of the hydrogen atom, which he took to consist of a single negatively
charged electron orbiting a positively charged nucleus. He went back to his memorandum
on the quantum theory of the atom, in particular, to his expression for the binding energy,
or kinetic energy, of the electron (4.21). He realised that he could determine the value of
his constant K from the expression for the Balmer series. The running term in 1/n2 can be
associated with (4.23), if we write for hydrogen with Z = 1,
T =
mee4
32ϵ2
0n2K 2 .
(4.24)
Then, when the electron changes from an orbit with quantum number n to that with n = 2,
the energy of the emitted radiation would be the difference in kinetic energies of the two
states. Applying Einstein’s quantum hypothesis, this energy should be equal to hν. Inserting
the numerical values of the constants into (4.24), Bohr found that the constant K was exactly
h/2. Therefore, the energy of the state with quantum number n is
E = −T = −mee4
8ϵ2
0n2h2 .
(4.25)
The angular momentum of the state could be found immediately by writing T = 1
2 Iω′2 =
8π4mea2ν′2, from which it follows that
J = Iω′ = nh
2π .
(4.26)
This is how Bohr arrived at the quantisation of angular momentum according to the old
quantum theory. Perhaps most spectacularly, the theory enabled the value of the Rydberg
constant to be expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. From (4.25), it follows
immediately that
R∞=
mee4
8ϵ2
0h3c = 1.097 × 107 m−1 .
(4.27)
In the ﬁrst paper of his famous trilogy (Bohr, 1913a,b,c), Bohr acknowledged that Nicholson
had discovered the quantisation of angular momentum in his papers of 1912. These results
were the inspiration for what became known as the Bohr model of the atom.
In addition to the Balmer series of hydrogen, Bohr’s expression could account for the
Paschen series of hydrogen which had been discovered in the near-infrared region of the
spectrum by Friedrich Paschen in 1908 (Paschen, 1908). In this case, Bohr’s formula became

(4.28)
where again R∞= 1.097 × 107 m−1 but now m = 3 and n = 4, 5, 6, . . . The formula also
predicted a series of lines with m = 1 and n = 2, 3, 4, . . . , which was discovered by
Theodore Lyman in 1914, the Lyman series of hydrogen (Lyman, 1914).

4.6 The X-ray spectra of the chemical elements
In the ﬁrst paper of the trilogy of 1913, Bohr noted that a similar formula to (4.23)
could account for the Pickering series, which had been discovered in 1896 by Edward
Pickering in the spectra of stars (Pickering, 1896). In 1912, Alfred Fowler discovered
similar series in laboratory experiments (Fowler, 1912). Bohr argued that singly ionised
helium atoms would have exactly the same spectrum as hydrogen, but the wavelengths of the
corresponding lines would be four times shorter, as observed in the Pickering series. Fowler
objected, however, that the ratio of the Rydberg constants for singly ionised helium and
hydrogen was not 4, but 4.00163 (Fowler, 1913a). Bohr realised that the problem arose from
neglecting the contribution of the mass of the nucleus to the computation of the moments
of inertia of the hydrogen atom and the helium ion. If the angular velocity of the electron
and the nucleus about their centre of mass is ω, the condition for the quantisation of angular
momentum is
nh
2π = μωR2,
(4.29)
where μ = memN/(me + mN) is the reduced mass of the atom, or ion, which takes account
of the contributions of both the electron and the nucleus to the angular momentum; R is
their separation. Therefore, the ratio of Rydberg constants for ionised helium and hydrogen
should be
RHe+
RH
= 4
⎛
⎜⎝
1 + me
M
1 + me
4M
⎞
⎟⎠= 4.00160 ,
(4.30)
where M is the mass of the hydrogen atom (Bohr, 1913d). Thus, precise agreement was
found between the theoretical estimates and laboratory measurements of the ratio of Ry-
dberg constants for hydrogen and ionised helium. In a further paper to Nature, Fowler
acknowledged that Bohr’s formula was indeed a better and more elegant explanation of the
lines observed in the spectrum of singly ionised helium (Fowler, 1913b).
Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom was a quite remarkable achievement and the ﬁrst
convincing application of quantum concepts to atoms. Bohr’s dramatic results were per-
suasive evidence for many scientists that Einstein’s quantum theory had to be taken really
seriously for processes occurring on the atomic scale. In his biography of Bohr, Pais (1985)
recounts the story of Hevesy’s encounter with Einstein in September 1913. When Einstein
heard of Bohr’s analysis of the Balmer series of hydrogen, he remarked cautiously that
Bohr’s work was very interesting, and important if right. When Hevesy told him about the
helium results, Einstein responded,
‘This is an enormous achievement. The theory of Bohr must then be right.’
4.6 Moseley and the X-ray spectra of the chemical elements
Support for Bohr’s model was not long in coming. Barkla continued his studies of the
scattered X-ray emission of different elements and in 1908 he and Charles Sadler discovered

that each element had a characteristic X-ray signature which was correlated with the atomic
weight of the material (Barkla and Sadler, 1908). In these experiments, the absorption of
the X-rays by thin aluminium sheets was used to measure the ‘hardness’ or ‘softness’ of
the X-ray emission. For a number of elements the ﬂuorescent emission consisted of two
components, a ‘soft’ component which was readily absorbed and a ‘hard’ component which
suffered very much less absorption. In 1911, he summarised the results of his numerous
absorption experiments (Fig. 4.3), demonstrating that the materials had both hard and soft
components, which he labelled K and L (Barkla, 1911b).
Henry Moseley was a member of Rutherford’s team in Manchester, but rather than
working on radioactivity, he studied the characteristic X-ray emission of the elements.
Barkla’s experiments provided a rough indication of the spectra of ﬂuorescent X-rays but
the picture changed dramatically with von Laue’s discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by
crystals (Sect. 2.2.1). Von Laue and his colleagues used the crystal materials as transmission
gratings in which the diffracted X-rays passed through the crystal and the diffraction pattern
was recorded on a photographic plate. In contrast, William and Lawrence Bragg realised
that pure crystal samples such as rock salt could be used as a diffraction grating in which the
spectrum of the X-rays could be found in reﬂection according to Bragg’s law nλ = 2d sin θ,
where λ is the wavelength of the radiation, d is the lattice spacing and θ is the angle between
the crystal planes and the direction of incidence of the X-ray beam; n is an integer. The
invention of the X-ray spectrometer enabled X-ray spectra to be recorded on photographic
plates with high spectral resolution (Fig. 4.4).
In Moseley’s experiments, different pure materials were inserted into an X-ray tube
and the reﬂected X-rays were analysed spectroscopically by reﬂecting them from a care-
fully prepared sample of rock salt. He discovered that the reﬂected spectrum consisted of

continuum radiation superimposed upon which were strong X-ray lines. The continuum
radiation was the bremsstrahlung, or braking radiation, of the energetic electrons deceler-
ated in the material. The lines were responsible for the K and L components of the X-ray
emission identiﬁed by Barkla. The K lines were split into two components which Moseley
labelled Kα and Kβ. Corresponding splittings were observed in the L lines at somewhat
longer wavelengths. The Kα line was about ﬁve times stronger than the Kβ line but the Kβ
lines had frequencies about 10% greater than those of the Kα lines.
By this date, it was well known that the number of electrons in atoms was roughly
half the atomic weight and was correlated with the position of the element in the periodic
table. It was also known that the atomic weights of many of the successive elements in
the periodic table differed by about two mass units. In 1913, the Dutch lawyer Antonius
Johannes van den Broek made the proposal that, starting with Z = 1 for hydrogen, each
atom is characterised by the number of electrons which is exactly equal to the sequential
order of the elements in the periodic table (Fig. 1.2) (van den Broek, 1913). Since there
were gaps of more than two mass units in the periodic table, van den Broek proposed that
these were ﬁlled by as yet undiscovered elements.
The most spectacular result of Moseley’s experiments was the discovery of the correlation
between the frequency of the X-ray lines and the atomic number Z, corresponding to the
number of electrons in the neutral atom (Moseley, 1913, 1914). In his papers, he plotted
these correlations separately for the Kα, Kβ, Lα and Lβ lines (Fig. 4.5). The remarkable
linear correlation between the square root of the frequencies of the lines and the atomic
number had a number of crucial consequences. Moseley wrote the correlation between the
square root of the frequencies of the Kα lines and the atomic number in the somewhat

with m and n different values of the quantum number, generically to be called n, char-
acterising the stationary states. The Kα line would correspond to transitions between the
stationary states with n = 1 and n = 2, while the Lα lines would correspond to transitions
from n = 3 to n = 2. For the Kα line, this would occur if an electron were removed from
the n = 1 orbit and was replaced by an electron making a transition from the n = 2 to the
n = 1 state. Similarly, the Lα lines would arise from an electron being removed from
the n = 2 orbit and being replaced by one from the n = 3 orbital. It was a puzzle why
the dependence upon atomic number should be (Z −1)2 and (Z −7.4)2 rather than Z2.
This was to remain a puzzle until the screening of the nucleus by the inner electrons was
fully appreciated, but this realisation required a number of key additional features of atomic
structure which were to be discovered over the following decade. Rutherford immediately
appreciated the signiﬁcance of Moseley’s discovery. In his words,
‘The original suggestion of van den Broek that the charge of the nucleus is equal to the
atomic number and not to half the atomic weight seems to me very promising. The idea
has already been used by Bohr in his theory of the constitution of atoms. The strongest
and most convincing evidence in support of this hypothesis will be found in a paper by
Moseley in the Philosophical Magazine of this month. He there shows that the frequency
of the X-radiations from a number of elements can be simply explained if the number of
unit charges on the nucleus is equal to the atomic number. It would appear that the charge
of the nucleus is the fundamental constant which determines the physical and chemical
properties of the atom, while the atomic weight, although it approximately follows the
order of the nuclear charge, is probably a complicated function of the latter depending
upon the detailed structure of the nucleus.’ (Rutherford, 1913)
Conclusions (4) and (5) of Moseley’s paper of 1914 read:
(4) The order of the atomic numbers is the same as that of the atomic weights, except
where the latter disagrees with the order of the chemical properties.
(5) Known elements correspond with all the numbers between 13 and 79 except three.
There are here three possible elements still undiscovered.
Conclusion 4 resulted in the reordering of the elements nickel (Z = 28) and cobalt (Z = 27),
in accord with their chemical properties. Conclusion 5 resulted in the prediction of ele-
ments with atomic numbers 43, 61 and 75 (see Fig. 4.5) which were only discovered many
years later as the elements technetium (Tc), promethium (Pm) and rhenium (Re) respec-
tively. Tragically, Moseley was killed in action during the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey on
10 August 1915.

The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
Fig. 4.6
Franck and Hertz’ measurements to determine the ionisation potential of mercury vapour. In fact, the maxima in the
graph correspond to the excitation of electrons from the ground state to the first excited state 4.9 eV above the ground
level (Franck and Hertz, 1914).
4.7 The Franck–Hertz experiment
The reality of the stationary states within atoms was reinforced by the experiments of
James Franck and Gustav Hertz (Franck and Hertz, 1914). Their objective was to measure
the ionisation potentials of atoms by bombarding them with electrons which had been
accelerated through a precisely known electrostatic potential. In their classic experiment of
1914, they aimed to measure the ionisation potential of mercury vapour. Their results are
shown in Fig. 4.6 in which, at small voltages, the current plotted on the ordinate increases as
the energy of the electrons measured in electron volts increases. At an accelerating voltage
of 4.9 eV, however, there is a sudden decrease in the current. As the voltage is increased
further, the current again increases and then suddenly decreases at 9.8 eV. In fact, these
steep decreases were found at integral multiples of the voltage of the ﬁrst decrease at 4.9 eV.
In addition, they found evidence for an emission line at a wavelength of 253.6 nm, which
would correspond to an energy of hν = 4.9 eV. They interpreted 4.9 eV as the ionisation
potential of mercury vapour.
If this were correct it would have contradicted the basic postulates of the Bohr model of
the atom since the mercury spectrum also displayed higher frequency Paschen lines with
a series limit at 185.0 nm. Bohr interpreted the results of their experiments differently.
He argued that the energy of 4.9 eV corresponded to the excitation energy of an electron

4.8 The reception of Bohr’s theory of the atom
from the ground state to the ﬁrst excited state and that the line at 253.6 nm represented
the emission associated with the transition of an electron from the ﬁrst excited state to ﬁll
the vacancy in the ground state (Bohr, 1915). The steep decreases at multiples of the ﬁrst
excited state corresponded to the electron being accelerated through a sufﬁcient voltage to
remove two or more successive electrons from the ground state. In due course, Franck and
Hertz agreed with Bohr’s interpretation.
The signiﬁcance of the Franck–Hertz experiment was that it provided compelling evi-
dence for the existence of stationary states within atoms, quite independent of the spectro-
scopic data.
4.8 The reception of Bohr’s theory of the atom
The experiments and their interpretation described in the last three sections indicated
that, whatever reservations theorists might have had about the underlying physics of the
Bohr model of the atom, the concepts of quantisation and stationary states within atoms
had to be taken seriously. Despite the concerns about the stability of atoms according
to Bohr’s picture, many results were beginning to fall into place and the theorists could
not neglect them. The succeeding years would witness a major increase in activity in
experimental and theoretical physics dedicated to the study of quanta. The Bohr picture
contained only a single quantum number n which labelled the energies of the stationary
states. This was the ﬁrst step along a chain of events which would lead to the appreciation
that more quantum numbers and selection rules would have to be introduced to understand
the plethora of quantum phenomena observed in atoms. In these endeavours, Bohr was
fortunate in involving Sommerfeld in tackling these problems.

Sommerfeld and Ehrenfest – generalising
the Bohr model
5.1 Introduction
Bohr’s success in accounting for the frequencies observed in the spectral series of hydrogen
was rightly regarded as a triumph, despite the fact that it violated the classical laws of
mechanics and electromagnetism. It could not account, however, for the spectra of helium
and heavier elements. The Bohr model was the simplest possible model for the dynamics
of a single electron in the electrostatic potential of a positively charged point nucleus, in
that it involved only quantised circular orbits deﬁned by a single quantum number n, what
became known as the principal quantum number. At the 1911 Solvay Conference, before
Bohr’s announcement of his model for the hydrogen atom, Poincar´e had raised the issue
of how the quantisation conditions could be extended to systems of more than one degree
of freedom. The problem was attacked by both Planck and Sommerfeld. Their approaches
ended up being essentially the same, although expressed in somewhat different language.
We will follow Sommerfeld’s approach.
In 1891 Michelson had shown that the Hα and Hβ lines of the Balmer series dis-
played very narrow splittings (Michelson, 1891, 1892). Although incompatible with Bohr’s
theory, the problem was set aside in the face of the other remarkable successes of the
theory. Sommerfeld suspected that the explanation lay in the fact that Bohr’s quantisa-
tion condition involved only a single degree of freedom. In his papers of 1915 and 1916,
he extended the quantisation of the orbits of the electron to more than one degree of
freedom and accounted for the splitting of the lines of the Balmer series once a spe-
cial relativistic treatment of the model was adopted (Sommerfeld, 1915a,b, 1916a). These
advances are beautifully described in his inﬂuential book Atombau und Spektrallinien
(Atomic Structure and Spectral Lines) (Sommerfeld, 1919) which was based upon his lec-
ture courses on atomic spectra and their interpretation. Van der Waerden (1967) remarks
that,
‘it was mainly from this book that the young physicists who created Quantum Mechanics
in 1925–26 learned Quantum Theory.’
Let us demonstrate exactly what Sommerfeld achieved.

5.2 Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr model
Fig. 5.1
Illustrating the geometry of an ellipse with eccentricity ϵ = 0.5 in the (r, φ) coordinate system used in Sect. 5.2.
5.2 Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr model to elliptical orbits
The obvious extension of the Bohr model was to elliptical rather than circular orbits. The
equation for an ellipse in pedal, or (r, φ), coordinates is
λ
r = 1 + ϵ cos φ ,
(5.1)
where λ = a(1 −ϵ2) is the semi-latus rectum, a is the semi-major axis of the ellipse and ϵ
is its eccentricity. r is the radial distance from a focus to a point on the ellipse and φ is the
angle between the major axis and the radius vector r. The semi-minor axis of the ellipse is
b = a(1 −ϵ2)1/2. This geometry is illustrated in Fig. 5.1.
It is apparent that there are now two independent parameters which deﬁne the orbit of
the electron, r and φ. The Bohr model involves the quantisation of the angular coordinate
φ through the quantisation of angular momentum mevr = nφh/2π = nφ¯h, where r and v
are constants.1 Bohr and Sommerfeld realised that this quantisation condition could also
be written in the form
 2π
0
pφ dφ = nφh ,
(5.2)
where pφ is the angular momentum and φ the azimuthal angle. Sommerfeld, widely recog-
nised as one of the leading mathematical physicists in Europe, appreciated that pφ and φ
are canonical coordinates in Hamiltonian mechanics and so (5.2) provides the prescription
for the quantisation condition of such pairs of coordinates. As expressed by Jammer (1989),
‘Sommerfeld postulated that the stationary states of a periodic system with f degrees of
freedom are determined by the condition that the ‘phase integral for every coordinate is

#
pk dqk = nkh ,
(5.3)
where pk is the momentum corresponding to the coordinate qk, nk is a non-negative
integer and the integration is extended over a period of qk.’
Speciﬁcally, in the case of the elliptical orbits, the generalisation of the quantum conditions
to two coordinates becomes
# 2π
0
pφ dφ = nφh
and
#

pr dr = nrh ,
(5.4)
where nφ and nr are non-negative integers. In polar coordinates qk ≡(r, φ), the kinetic
energy T of the electron is
T = me
2 (˙r2 + r2 ˙φ2) .
(5.5)
Then, according to the prescription developed in Sect. 5.4.3 (equations 5.52, 5.53 and 5.61),
the corresponding momenta pk = ∂T /∂˙qk are
pφ = mer2 ˙φ
and
pr = me˙r ,
(5.6)
which are the azimuthal angular momentum and radial momentum of the electron respec-
tively.
The quantum condition for ( ˙φ, φ) yields exactly the same result given by the circular
Bohr model, namely,
 2π
0
pφ dφ = nφh ;
2πpφ = nφh
or
pφ = nφ¯h .
(5.7)
pφ is therefore a constant of the motion. To derive the quantum condition for the radial
component of the momentum, we ﬁrst rewrite (5.1) as follows:
1
r = 1
a

5.2 Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr model
Unlike pφ, pr is not a constant of the motion. The quantum condition for the radial
component of the momentum therefore becomes

(1 + ϵ cos φ)2 dφ .
(5.13)
This is the result we have been seeking. The right-hand side of (5.13) depends only upon
the eccentricity ϵ and, because nφ and nr are integers, the ellipticity is also quantised.
Sommerfeld (1919) evaluated the integral (5.13) in Section 6 of the Mathematical Notes
and Addenda of his book and found the result
1 −ϵ2 =
n2
φ
(nφ + nr)2 ,
(5.14)
indicating that, of all possible ellipticities, only those involving the integers nφ and nr are
allowed.
Next, the energies of the orbits are evaluated. The kinetic energy of the electron is

The potential energy of the electron can also be written in a form independent of r using
(5.8):
U = −Ze2
4πϵ0r = −Ze2
4πϵ0a
1 + ϵ cos φ
1 −ϵ2
,
(5.18)
where the charge of the nucleus is Ze, in other words, Z is the atomic number of the
nucleus. Therefore, the total energy of the electron in its elliptical orbit is

The total energy is time-independent and so must be independent of φ which changes by
2π radians per orbit. The terms in cos φ in (5.19) must therefore sum to zero and so we can
ﬁnd the value of a

(5.23)
This is the remarkable result obtained by Sommerfeld in 1916. Even in his book of 1919,
he can scarcely contain his excitement. He writes,
‘This result is of the greatest consequence and is superlatively simple: we have found
for the energy of elliptical orbits the same value as . . . for circular orbits, with the one
difference that the quantum number n in the latter case is replaced by the quantum
sum, nφ + nr. Each of the quantised ellipses of our family has an amount of energy
equivalent to that of a deﬁnite Bohr circle.’2
This result is identical to (4.25) for the hydrogen atom for which Z = 1 and nr = 0. The
range of potential quantum transitions has been greatly increased. Considering transitions
between the upper (u) and lower (l) quantum states characterised by (nu
φ, nu

r),
evidently (nu

(5.25)
Thus, the spectral series is again identical with the Balmer and other series of hydrogen, but
the number of ways in which the lines can be produced has been considerably increased.
Sommerfeld’s words, again printed in italics, state:
‘. . . it has a deepened theoretical signiﬁcance and its origin now has multiple roots. By
the admission of elliptical orbits, the series has gained no extra lines and has lost none
of its sharpness.’
Sommerfeld developed his model of the atom using the following arguments. The case
nφ = 0 corresponds to a degenerate ellipse, ϵ = 1, which is a straight line joining the foci
of the ellipse and so this trajectory would pass though the nucleus. Sommerfeld excluded
this possibility so that nφ = 1, nr = 0 is the lowest energy state. Secondly, when nr = 0,

5.2 Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr model
Fig. 5.2
The quantised circular and elliptical orbits parameterised by the quantum numbers nφ and nr according to the
Sommerfeld model. Orbits with the same values of (nφ + nr) have the same energies.
the orbits become circles ϵ = 0 as can be seen from (5.14) for the ellipticity of the electron’s
orbit. The resulting families of orbits for (nφ + nr) = 1, 2, 3, and 4 and nr = 1, 2, and 3
are shown in Fig. 5.2 in which the orbits have been drawn to scale with respect to the foci
of the ellipses.
But, much more has been achieved. Although the unperturbed hydrogen atom now has
numerous ways of creating sharp Balmer lines, when the atom is placed in an electric or
magnetic ﬁeld, the lines associated with different initial and ﬁnal states are split because of
the different kinematics of the electron in the perturbed elliptical orbits. Speciﬁcally, the
Stark and Zeeman effects should display plentiful ﬁne structure (see Sects. 7.2 and 7.3).
Consider for example the case of the transition (nu
φ + nu
r) = 4 to (nl
φ + nl
r) = 3. We can
combine any of the orbits with (nu
φ + nu
r) = 4 in Fig. 5.2 with any of those with (nl
φ +
nl
r) = 3, in other words, there are (nu
φ + nu
r) × (nl
φ + nl
r) = 4 × 3 = 12 ways in which
the line can be produced. Likewise, for the Balmer series for which (nu
φ + nu
r) = 2 and
(nl
φ + nl
r) = 3, 4, 5, . . . the degeneracies would be 3 × 2 = 6 for Hα, 4 × 2 = 8 for Hβ,
5 × 2 = 10 for Hγ , 6 × 2 = 12 for Hδ and so on. Sommerfeld appreciated that not all of
these would be realised in nature and so there had to be additional principles of selection,
or selection rules, which determine which transitions are allowed. Initially, he provided a
set of empirical rules to avoid excessive numbers of lines.
Sommerfeld proceeded to the next generalisation of the model by considering quantisa-
tion in three dimensions. Spherical polar coordinates are the natural extension of the polar
coordinates considered so far, the three independent coordinates now being (r, θ, φ), where
θ is the polar angle measured from the axis of the (r, φ) coordinate system used above. The
quantisation conditions follow exactly the same prescription as (5.4), namely,
#
orbit
pr dr = nrh ;
# 2π
0
pφ dφ = nφh ;
# π
0
pθ dθ = nθh ,
(5.26)
where the new quantum number nθ is associated with the conjugate pair (pθ, θ). Carrying
out a similar analysis to the above two-dimensional calculation, Sommerfeld found that the
energy levels had to satisfy the relation n = nφ + nθ, where n, nφ, nθ are non-negative
integers. Once again, the energy levels corresponded precisely to those of the hydrogen

atom with additional degenerate energy levels. If we denote the total angular momentum
pψ, the quantisation condition is
pψ = nh
2π = (nφ + nθ)h
2π
,
(5.27)
but now the quantised ellipses can only be found at certain angles with respect to any
speciﬁed direction. Thus, the component of angular momentum along a chosen direction
is nφh/2π while the total angular momentum is nh/2π = (nφ + nθ)/2π and so the angle
between the chosen direction and the total angular momentum vector is given by cos α =
nφ/n = nφ/(nφ + nθ). The inference is that the planes of the orbits of the ellipses can
only take certain angles with respect to the chosen direction, which might be deﬁned by an
imposed electric or magnetic ﬁeld. This was the discovery of space quantisation.
5.3 Sommerfeld and the fine-structure constant
Perhaps the most remarkable results of Sommerfeld’s paper concerned the extension of the
Bohr model to include the effects of special relativity. The quantisation conditions remain
the same as in (5.4),
# 2π
0
pφ dφ = nφh
and
#
orbit
pr dr = nrh .
(5.28)
In Sommerfeld’s picture, the effect of relativity is to relieve the degeneracy of the orbits
because the total energies of the orbits are now slightly different. A simple interpretation of
the effect is that the elliptical orbits have different energies because the electrons acquire
high speeds in close encounters with the nucleus and so the relativistic corrections differ
from orbit to orbit.
Sommerfeld’s analysis in his book Atombau und Spektrallinien (Sommerfeld, 1919) is a
brilliant and clear exposition of the energy changes of the orbits of the electrons when the
effects of special relativity are taken into account. The analysis is somewhat lengthy and
so we summarise the key results of the analysis. The ﬁrst realisation is that the ellipses are
no longer stationary in space, but the perihelion of the electron’s orbit, the point of closest
approach to the nucleus, precesses about the nucleus. This is illustrated by the diagram
from Sommerfeld’s book (Fig. 5.3). In polar coordinates, Sommerfeld writes the expression
for the precessing elliptical orbit as
1
r = C1 + C2 cos γ φ ,
(5.29)
which differs from the case of the stationary ellipse (5.1) by the inclusion of the factor γ in
the cosine term. The quantity γ is deﬁned to be
γ 2 = 1 −p2

where p is now the relativistic three-momentum and is quantised according to the rule
$
p dφ = nφh. p0 is deﬁned to be the quantity p0 = Ze2/4πϵ0c. In the case of circular
Bohr orbits, it is straightforward to show that γ = (1 −v2/c2)1/2, in other words, the inverse
of my normal convention for the Lorentz factor γ = (1 −v2/c2)−1/2. Just for this section,
we will use γ in Sommerfeld’s sense. Inspection of (5.29) shows that, since γ ≤1, the orbit
does not close up after φ = 2π radians, but after γ φ = 2π radians. This slight change per
orbit is illustrated by the angle φ in Fig. 5.3. The orbits return to the standard elliptical
form however if we introduce the coordinate ψ = γ φ. Sommerfeld shows that the equation
for the ellipse now becomes

r = 1

(5.31)
while the momenta corresponding to r, φ are
pφ = mr2 ˙φ ,
pr = m˙r ,
(5.32)
where the momenta are relativistic three-momenta, that is, in (5.32) m = me(1 −v2/c2)−1/2.
The one important difference is that the quantisation condition in the radial direction now
corresponds to the integration over a single ellipse in the ψ coordinate, that is,

because the ellipticities of the orbits now depend differently upon nφ and nr as compared
with (5.14). The result (5.14) is recovered in the non-relativistic limit, which is obtained by
setting the ﬁne-structure constant α equal to zero.
Next, the energies of the elliptical orbits are evaluated. In the two-dimensional case with

This expression has a number of remarkable features. First, in the non-relativistic limit
c →∞, α →0, the second term in curly brackets disappears and we recover (5.23) for
the energies of the elliptical orbits. Secondly, the second term in curly brackets is entirely
associated with the effects of special relativity. The term associated with the factor 1/4 in
this term corresponds to a shift in energy of the energy level labelled (nφ + nr) as a whole
and does not result in any splitting of the energy level. In contrast, the term associated
with the factor nr/nφ results in splitting of the energy levels and Sommerfeld identiﬁed
this as the cause of the splitting of the lines of the Balmer series. This is why the quantity
α = e2/2ε0hc = 1/137.036 is referred to as the ﬁne-structure constant.
For hydrogen, the effect is most pronounced in the optical waveband for the Hα line,
in particular, with the splitting of the lower energy state with (nφ + nr) = 2. The splitting
of this level corresponds to the difference between the energies of the orbits with (nφ =
2, nr = 0) and (nφ = 1, nr = 1). Inserting these values into (5.36), the difference in energy
corresponds to a frequency shift

This was found to be in good agreement with Michelson’s measurements of ﬁne structure
in the Hα and Hβ lines of hydrogen. Even better agreement was found from Paschen’s
measurement of the splitting of the Balmer line of ionised helium He+ which has the same
form of ﬁne structure but the effect is 16 times greater because of the Z4 factor in the
expression for the ﬁne-structure displacement of the energy levels. Referring Paschen’s
result to the expected splitting for the hydrogen Balmer lines, the measured value was
νH = 0.3645 ± 0.0045 cm−1.
Sommerfeld next applied the theory of ﬁne-structure splitting to the K and L X-ray
ﬂuorescence lines into (Kα, Kβ) and (Lα, Lβ) discussed in Sect. 4.6 and seen in Fig. 4.5.
In the case of the K lines, Moseley’s formula (4.31) showed that the effective nuclear
charge was (Z −1) while (4.32) showed it was (Z −b) for L lines. Sommerfeld carried
out his own analysis of the L lines and found b = 3.5. Using the ‘shielded’ charges in the

expressions for the splitting of the L X-ray energy levels, the splittings expected for the
elements shown in Fig. 4.5 were expected to be vastly greater than that of hydrogen because
of the roughly Z4 dependence upon the effective nuclear charge. Extrapolating from the Lα
and Lβ X-ray lines of the heavy elements back to the case of hydrogen, Sommerfeld again
found νH = 0.365 cm−1.
Sommerfeld was rightly triumphant. He fully appreciated the fact that the success of
the theory not only provided evidence for the elliptical orbits of electrons in atoms, but
also provided a demonstration of the correctness of the special relativistic formula for the
momentum of the electron. In his words:
‘Thus, the observation of the ﬁne-structure discloses the whole mechanism of the intra-
atomic motions as far as the motion of the perihelion of the elliptic orbits. The complex of
facts contained in the ﬁne-structures has just the same importance for the special theory
of relativity and for the atomic structure, as the motion of Mercury’s perihelion for the
general theory of relativity.’
These results provided the basic elements for the old quantum theory which was to be
greatly elaborated by Bohr and his associates. Sommerfeld took the generalised quantum
conditions
#
pk dqk = nkh
(5.38)
to be the ultimate foundations of quantum theory, statements which were ‘unproved and
perhaps incapable of being proved’. He also realised that much more powerful mathematical
tools were already available for carrying out calculations in the quantum theory. In fact, these
considerations were to lead to the natural mathematical language of quantum mechanics.
5.4 A mathematical interlude – from Newton to Hamilton–Jacobi
It is worthwhile reviewing how the methods of higher mechanics provided the route to the
analysis of problems in quantum theory. As Sommerfeld remarked,
‘It is truly a royal route for quantum problems.’
The history of the development of more and more powerful ways of expressing the
content of Newton’s laws of motion can be appreciated from the historical sequence of
approaches:

r D’Alembert’s principle,
r Hamilton’s principle,
r The principle of least action,
r Generalised coordinates and Lagrange’s equations,

Sommerfeld and Ehrenfest
Very often, various more advanced approaches provide much more straightforward routes
to the solutions to problems and provide a deeper appreciation of the basic features of
dynamical systems, including conservation laws and normal modes of oscillation of a
mechanical or dynamical system.
5.4.1 Newton’s laws of motion and principles of ‘least action’
Some of the most powerful approaches involve ﬁnding that function which minimises
the value of some quantity subject to well-deﬁned boundary conditions. In the formal
development of mechanics, the procedures are stated axiomatically. Let us take as an
example what Feynman refers to as the principle of minimum action. Consider the case of
the dynamics of a particle in a conservative ﬁeld of force, that is, one which is derived as
the gradient of a scalar potential, F = −grad V .
We introduce a set of axioms which enables us to work out the path of the particle subject
to this force ﬁeld. First, we deﬁne the quantity
L = T −V = 1
2mv2 −V ,
(5.39)
the difference between the kinetic energy T and the potential energy V of the particle in
the ﬁeld. To derive the trajectory of the particle between two ﬁxed endpoints in the ﬁeld in
a ﬁxed time interval t1 to t2, we ﬁnd that path which minimises the function
S =
 t2

2mv2 −V

dt =
 t2
t1


2m
dr
dt
2
−V

dt .
(5.40)
These statements are to be regarded as equivalent to Newton’s laws of motion or, rather,
what Newton accurately called his ‘axioms’. L is called the Lagrangian.
These axioms are consistent with Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion. If there are no forces
present, V = constant and hence we minimise S =
 t2
t1 v2 dt. The minimum value of S must
correspond to a constant velocity v between t1 and t2. If the particle travelled between the
endpoints by accelerating and decelerating in such a way that t1 and t2 are the same, the
integral must be greater than that for constant velocity between t1 and t2 because v2 appears
in the integral and a basic rule of analysis tells us that ⟨v2⟩≥⟨v⟩2. Thus, in the absence of
forces, v = constant, Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion.
To proceed further, we need the techniques of the calculus of variations. Suppose f (x)
is a function of a single variable x. The minimum value of the function corresponds to the
value of x at which d f (x)/dx is zero. Approximating the variation of the function about
the minimum at x = 0 by a power series,
f (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · · ,
(5.41)
the function can only have d f/dx = 0 at x = 0 if a1 = 0. At this point, the function is
approximately a parabola since the ﬁrst non-zero coefﬁcient in the expansion of f (x) about
the minimum is the term in x2 – for small displacements x from the minimum, the change
in the function f (x) is second order in x.

5.4 A mathematical interlude
The same principle is used to ﬁnd the path of the particle when S is minimised. If the
true path of the particle is x0(t), another path between t1 and t2 is given by
x(t) = x0(t) + η(t)
(5.42)
where η(t) describes the deviation of x(t) from the minimum path x0(t). Just as we can
deﬁne the minimum of a function as the point at which there is no ﬁrst-order dependence
of the function upon x, so we can deﬁne the minimum of the function x(t) as that function
for which the dependence on η(t) is at least second order, that is, there should be no linear
term in η(t).

We now seek to eliminate ﬁrst-order quantities in dη and hence we can drop the term
(dη/dt)2. We expand V (x0 + η) to ﬁrst order in η by a Taylor expansion,
V (x0 + η) = V (x0) + ∇V · η .
(5.44)
Substituting (5.44) into (5.43) and preserving only quantities to ﬁrst order in η, we ﬁnd

(5.45)
Now the ﬁrst two terms inside the integral are the minimum path and so are a constant. We
therefore need to ensure that the last two terms have no dependence upon η, the condition
for a minimum. We therefore need consider only the last two terms,
S =

(5.50)
Thus, our alternative formulation of the laws of motion in terms of an action principle is
exactly equivalent to Newton’s statement of the laws of motion.
These procedures can be generalised to take account of conservative and non-
conservative forces such as those which depend upon velocity, for example, friction and the
force on a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld (Goldstein, 1950). The key point is that we
have a prescription which involves writing down the kinetic and potential energies (T and
V respectively) of the system and then forming the Lagrangian L and ﬁnding the minimum
value of the function S. The advantage of this procedure is that it is often a straightforward
matter to write down these energies in some suitable set of coordinates. We therefore need
rules which tell us how to ﬁnd the minimum value of S in any set of coordinates which is
convenient for the problem in hand. These are the Euler–Lagrange equations.
5.4.2 The Euler–Lagrange equations
Let us consider a system of N particles interacting through a scalar potential function V .
The positions of the N particles are given by the vectors [r1, r2, r3, . . . , r N] in Cartesian
coordinates. Since three numbers are needed to describe the position of each particle,
for example, xi, yi, zi, the vector describing the positions of all the particles has 3N
coordinates. For greater generality, we wish to transform these coordinates into a different
set of coordinates which we write as [q1, q2, q3, . . . , q3N]. The set of relations between
these coordinates can be written
qi = qi(r1, r2, r3, . . . , r N),
and hence
ri = ri(q1, q2, q3, . . . , q3N) .
(5.51)
This amounts to no more than a change of variables.
The aim of the procedure is to write down the equations for the dynamics of the particles,
that is, an equation for each independent coordinate, in terms of the coordinates qi rather
than ri. We are guided by the analysis of the previous subsection on action principles to
form the quantities T and V , the kinetic and potential energies respectively, in terms of the
new set of coordinates and then to ﬁnd the stationary value of S, that is
L = T −V ,
δS = δ
 t2
t1
(T −V ) dt = 0 ,
(5.52)
where δ means ‘take the variation about a particular value of the coordinates’ as discussed
in the previous subsection. This formulation is called Hamilton’s principle and as before
L is the Lagrangian of the system. Notice that Hamilton’s principle makes no reference to
the coordinate system to be used in the calculation.
The kinetic energy of the system is
T =

5.4 A mathematical interlude
In terms of our new coordinate system, we can write without loss of generality
ri = ri(q1, q2, . . . , q3N, t)
and
˙ri = ˙ri(˙q1, ˙q2, ˙q3, . . . , ˙q3N, q1, q2, . . . , q3N, t) .
(5.54)
Notice that we have now included explicitly the time dependence of ri and ˙ri. Therefore, we
can write the kinetic energy as a function of the coordinates ˙qi, qi and t, that is, T (˙qi, qi, t),
where we understand that all the values of i from 1 to 3N are included. Similarly, we can
write the expression for the potential energy entirely in terms of the coordinates qi and t,
that is, V (qi, t). We therefore need to ﬁnd the stationary values of
S =
 t2
t1
[T (˙qi, qi, t) −V (qi, t)] dt =
 t2
t1
L(˙qi, qi, t) dt .
(5.55)
We repeat the analysis of Sect. 5.4.1 in which we found the condition for S to be
independent of ﬁrst-order perturbations about the minimum path. As before, we let q0(t)
be the minimum solution and write the expression for another function q(t) in the form
q(t) = q0(t) + η(t) .
(5.56)
Now we insert the trial solution (5.56) into (5.55),
S =
 t2
t1
L[˙q0(t) + ˙η(t), q0(t) + η(t), t] dt .

The equations (5.59) represents 3N second-order differential equations for the time evo-
lution of the 3N coordinates and are known as the Euler–Lagrange equations. They are
no more than Newton’s laws of motion written in the qi coordinate system which can be
chosen to be the most convenient for the particular problem at hand.

5.4.3 Hamilton’s equations
Another way of developing the equations of mechanics and dynamics is to convert (5.59)
into a set of 6N ﬁrst-order differential equations by introducing the generalised momenta
pi. There was no mention of the components of the momenta of the particles pi in the last
subsection but these can be introduced by taking the derivative of the Lagrangian (5.52) in
Cartesian coordinates with respect to the component of velocity ˙xi, and we ﬁnd

(5.60)
This expression indicates how the concept of momentum can be generalised within the
framework of the Lagrangian approach to mechanics. The quantity ∂L/∂˙qi is deﬁned to be
pi, the canonical momentum, conjugate to the coordinate qi, by
pi = ∂L
∂˙qi
.
(5.61)
The pi deﬁned by (5.61) do not necessarily have the dimensions of linear velocity times
mass if qi is not in Cartesian coordinates. Furthermore, if the potential is velocity dependent,
even in Cartesian coordinates, the generalised momentum is not identical with the usual
deﬁnition of mechanical momentum. An example of this is the motion of a charged particle
in an electromagnetic ﬁeld in Cartesian coordinates for which the Lagrangian is
L =

i

2mi ˙r2
i −

i
eiφ(xi) +

ei A(xi) · ˙ri ,
(5.62)
where ei is the charge of the particle i, φ(xi) is the electrostatic potential at the particle i
and A(xi) the vector potential at the same position. Then, the x-component of the canonical
momentum of the ith particle is
pix = ∂L
∂˙xi
= mi ˙xi + ei Ax ,
(5.63)
and similarly for the y- and z-coordinates.
With these deﬁnitions, a number of conservation laws can be derived.3 For example, if
the Lagrangian does not depend upon the coordinate qi, (5.59) immediately shows that the
generalised momentum is conserved, d ˙pi/dt = 0, pi = constant. Another standard result
is that the total energy of the system in a conservative ﬁeld of force with no time-dependent
constraints is given by the Hamiltonian H which can be written
H =

i
pi ˙qi −L(q, ˙q) .
(5.64)
It looks as though H depends upon pi, ˙qi and qi but, in fact, we can rearrange the
equation to show that H is a function of only pi and qi. Let us take the total differential of
H in the usual way, assuming L is time independent. Then

dH =

we ﬁnd from the Euler–Lagrange equation,

We thus reduce the equations of motion to the pair of relations
˙qi = ∂H
∂pi
,
˙pi = −∂H
∂qi
(5.69)
This pair of equations is known as Hamilton’s equations. They are ﬁrst-order differential
equations for each of the 3N coordinates. We are now treating the pis and the qis on the
same footing. If V is independent of ˙q, H is just the total energy T + V expressed in terms
of the coordinates pi and qi.
5.4.4 The Hamilton–Jacobi equations and action–angle variables
Why do we have to delve deeper into the principles of classical mechanics? Hamilton’s
equations (5.69) are often difﬁcult to solve but they can be simpliﬁed to tackle speciﬁc
problems. It turned out that the appropriate tools were available for application to the
quantum theory through Carl Jacobi’s extension of Hamilton’s equations. In his classic
textbook Classical Mechanics, Goldstein (1950) remarks:
‘For a long time action–angle variables remained an esoteric technique of classical me-
chanics used only by astronomers. The situation changed rapidly with the advent of Bohr’s
quantum theory of the atom, for it was found that the quantum conditions could be stated
most simply in terms of action variables. In classical mechanics the action variables pos-
sess a continuous range of values, but this is no longer the case in quantum mechanics.
The quantum conditions of Sommerfeld and Wilson required that the motion be limited
to such orbits for which the “proper” action variables had discrete values which were
integral multiples of h, the quantum of action.’

Sommerfeld and Ehrenfest
These ‘esoteric’ procedures had been used with considerable success in astronomical prob-
lems, for example, in Delauney’s Th´eorie du mouvement de la lune (1860, 1867) and in
Charlier’s Die Mechanik des Himmels (1902). It is no surprise that Karl Schwarzschild,
theoretical astrophysicist and the Director of the Potsdam Observatory, was one of the
principal contributors to the introduction of Hamilton–Jacobi theory into the solution of
problems in quantum theory.
The mathematical procedures which result in the Hamilton–Jacobi equations and their
application to astronomical and quantum problems are elegantly expounded by Goldstein
(1950). We present here a simpliﬁed version of that story aimed at deriving the useful
solutions as directly as possible. The essence of the approach is to transform from one
set of coordinates to another, while preserving the Hamiltonian form of the equations of
motion and ensuring that the new variables are also canonical coordinates. This approach
is sometimes called the transformation theory of mechanics. Thus, suppose we wish to
transform between the set of coordinates qi to a new set Qi. We need to ensure that the
independent momentum coordinates simultaneously transform into canonical coordinates
in the new system, that is, there should also be a set of coordinates Pi corresponding to pi.
Thus, the problem is to deﬁne the new coordinates (Qi, Pi) in terms of the old coordinates
(qi, pi):
Qi = Qi(q, p, t) ,
Pi = Pi(q, p, t) .
(5.70)
We need to ﬁnd the transformations which result in the (Qi, Pi) being canonical coordinates
such that
˙Qi = ∂K
∂Pi
,
˙Pi = −∂K
∂Qi
(5.71)
where K is now the Hamiltonian in the (Qi, Pi) coordinate system. The transformations
which result in (5.71) are known as canonical transformations. They are also known as
contact transformations. In the old system, the coordinates satisﬁed Hamilton’s variational
principle,

pi ˙qi −H(q, p, t)

and so the same rule must hold true in the new set of coordinates,

Pi ˙Qi −K(Q, P, t)

(5.73)
The equations (5.72) and (5.73) must be valid simultaneously. The clever trick is to note
that the integrands inside the integrals in (5.72) and (5.73) need not be equal, but can differ
by the total time derivative of some arbitrary function S. This works because the integral of
S between the ﬁxed endpoints is a constant and so disappears when the variations in (5.72)
and (5.73) are carried out,

The function S is known as the generating function because once it is speciﬁed, the trans-
formation equations (5.70) are completely determined. It looks as though S is a function
of the four coordinates (qi, pi, Qi, Pi), but in fact they are related by the functions (5.70)
and so S can be deﬁned by any two of (qi, pi, Qi, Pi). Goldstein (1950) and Lindsay and
Margenau (1957) show how the various transformations between the coordinate systems
can be written. For example, if we choose to write the transformations in terms of pi, Pi,
the transformation equations are
pi = ∂S
∂qi
,
Pi = −∂S
∂Qi
and
K = H + ∂S
∂t .
(5.75)
Alternatively, if we choose qi, Pi, the transformation equations become
pi = ∂S
∂qi
,
Qi = ∂S
∂Pi
with
K = H + ∂S
∂t .
(5.76)
The other two sets of transformations are included in the endnote.4
Example Let us ﬁrst work out the motion of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in this
new formalism. The mass of the oscillator is m and the spring constant k. From these, we
can deﬁne the angular frequency ω by ω2 = k/m. The Hamiltonian is therefore
H = p2
2m + kq2
2
.
(5.77)
Now introduce a generating function deﬁned by
S = mω
2 q2 cot Q ,
(5.78)
which depends only upon q and Q. We can therefore use (5.75) to ﬁnd the transformations
between coordinate systems. There is no explicit dependence of S upon time t and so, from
the third equation of (5.75), H = K. We can now ﬁnd the coordinates p and q in terms of
the new coordinates P and Q. From the ﬁrst and second equations of (5.75)
p = ∂S
∂q = mωq cot Q ,
P = −∂S
∂Q = mω
2 q2 cosec2 Q .
(5.79)
These can be reorganised to give expressions for p and q in terms of P and Q:
q =
*
2
mω
√
P sin Q ,
p =
√
2mω
√
P cos Q .
(5.80)
Substituting these expressions for p and q into the Hamiltonian (5.77), we ﬁnd
H = K = p2
2m + kq2
2
= ωP .
(5.81)
We now ﬁnd the solutions for P and Q from Hamilton’s equations
˙P = −∂K
∂Q ,
˙Q = ∂K
∂P ,

and so, from (5.81), it follows that
˙P = 0 , ˙Q = ω
and so
P = α , Q = ωt + β ,
(5.83)
where α and β are constants. These solutions can now be substituted into (5.80) and we
ﬁnd
p =
√
2mωα cos(ωt + β) ,
q =
*
2α
mω sin(ωt + β) .
(5.84)
Notice how economically we can determine the constants of the motion once we have found
an appropriate generating function S.
The question is then, ‘Can we ﬁnd the appropriate generating functions for the problem
at hand?’ For the cases in which we are interested in which there is no explicit dependence
upon the time t and in which the variables in the partial differential equations are separable,
the answer is ‘Yes’. We begin with the relation between the Hamiltonian H and the total
energy of the system E. For the cases we are interested in,
H(qi, pi) = E .
(5.85)
We can now replace pi by its deﬁnition in terms of the partial differentials of the generating
function S, pi = ∂S/∂qi so that

(5.87)
Equation (5.87) is known as the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in time-independent form. S is
also referred to as Hamilton’s principal function.
We are interested in periodic solutions of the equations of motion for conservative
motion under a central ﬁeld of force. There is no explicit dependence of the coordinate
transformations upon time and so the transformation equations (5.76) become
pi = ∂S
∂qi
,
Qi = ∂S
∂Pi
with
K = H .
(5.88)
We now deﬁne a new coordinate
Ji =
#
pi dqi,
(5.89)
which is known as a phase integral, the integration of the momentum variable pi being
taken over a complete cycle of the values of qi. In the case of Cartesian coordinates, it
can be seen that Ji has the dimensions of angular momentum and is known as an action
variable, by analogy with Hamilton’s deﬁnition in his principle of least action. During one
cycle the values of qi vary continuously between ﬁnite values from qmin to qmax and back
again to qmin. As a result, from the deﬁnition (5.89), the action Ji is a constant. If qi does

be cyclic.
Accompanying Ji there is a conjugate quantity wi,

.
(5.90)
The corresponding canonical equations are
˙wi = ∂K
∂Ji
,
˙Ji = −∂K
∂wi
,
(5.91)
where K is the transformed Hamiltonian. wi is referred to as an angle variable and so the
motion of the particle is now described in terms of (Ji, wi) or action–angle variables. If
the transformed Hamiltonian K is independent of wi, it follows that
˙wi = constant = νi ,
˙Ji = 0 ,
(5.92)
where the νis are constants. Therefore,
wi = νit + γi ,
Ji = constant .
(5.93)
The constants νi are associated with the frequency of motion. If we take the integral of
wi round a complete cycle of qi, we ﬁnd
wi =
# ∂wi
∂qk

(5.95)
the last equality resulting from the deﬁnition pk = ∂S/∂qk. Thus, wi = 1, if i = k and
wi = 0, if i ̸= k. In other words, each independent variable wi changes from 0 to 1 when
the corresponding qi goes through a complete cycle.
It is apparent from these considerations that action–angle variables are the ideal tools
for studying the orbits of electrons in the old quantum theory, Sommerfeld’s ‘royal route
for quantum problems’. The introduction of action–angle variables into quantum theory
was pioneered by Schwarzschild and Epstein in the contexts to be described in Sect. 7.2
(Schwarzschild, 1916; Epstein, 1916a). As remarked by Jammer (1989),
‘. . . it almost seemed as if Hamilton’s method had expressly been created for treating
quantum mechanical problems.’
Let us give the example of Sommerfeld’s treatment of the Bohr model in three dimensions.
5.5 Sommerfeld’s model of the atom in three dimensions
The best way of illustrating how these procedures provide a natural set of mathematical
tools for quantum problems is to repeat Sommerfeld’s analysis of the quantisation of angular

From (5.61), the canonical momenta in (r, θ, φ) coordinates are pr = m˙r, pθ = mr2 ˙θ and

where we have written Hamilton’s function as W, rather than S.5 The total energy associated
with the Hamiltonian H is E and is a constant of the motion. We now write the function W
in separable form,
W = Wr(r) + Wθ(θ) + Wφ(φ) .
(5.99)
First, we consider the partial differential term in φ in (5.98). This relation must be true for
all φ and so

The three equations (5.100), (5.102) and (5.103) are conservation equations for motion in
the three independent coordinates (r, θ, φ). The ﬁrst (5.100) is simply the conservation of
angular momentum about the ﬁxed polar axis. There is also, however, angular momentum
about the θ-axis. Conservation of the total angular momentum p is given by (5.102) as may

with (5.97). The third equation (5.103) corresponds to the conservation of total energy.
Now we convert these results to action–angle variables. These are deﬁned by
J1 ≡Jφ =
#
pφ dφ =
# ∂Wφ
∂φ dφ ,
(5.105)
J2 ≡Jθ =

pθ dθ =
# ∂Wθ
∂θ dθ ,
(5.106)
J3 ≡Jr =
#
pr dr =
# ∂Wr
∂r dr .
(5.107)
Using (5.100), (5.102) and (5.103), these integrals can be written

(5.110)
The ﬁrst integral is trivial,
Jφ = 2παφ .
(5.111)
The second integral is most simply evaluated by comparing the expressions for the kinetic
energy in spherical polar and plane polar coordinates, as was done in the comparison of
(5.104) with (5.97),
pr ˙r + pθ ˙θ + pφ ˙φ = pr ˙r + p ˙ψ ,
(5.112)
where p is the total angular momentum and ψ is the azimuthal angle in the plane of the
orbit. Hence, replacing pθ ˙θ by p ˙ψ −pφ ˙φ, the action integral for Jθ can be written
Jθ =
#
p dψ −
#
pφ dφ .
(5.113)
Taking both integrals round 2π, we ﬁnd
Jθ = 2π(p −pφ) = 2π(αθ −αφ) .
(5.114)
The third integral for the radial action therefore becomes
Jr =

(5.115)
On performing this integral, we ﬁnd a relation between the energy of the system and the
action integrals Jφ, Jθ and Jr. This calculation is carried out by Goldstein by contour
integration with the ﬁnal remarkable result

Sommerfeld and Ehrenfest
This calculation has been entirely classical and the values of the action variables are
continuous. Sommerfeld now applied his quantum conditions to the three action integrals
(5.105), (5.106) and (5.107) with the result
Jφ =
#
pφ dφ = nφh ,
(5.117)
Jθ =
#
pθ dθ = nθh ,
(5.118)
Jr =
#
pr dr = nrh ,
(5.119)
where nφ, nθ and nr are integers. Now only certain orientations of the orbits of the electrons
in space are allowed and the energy levels are again degenerate in the non-relativistic
limit. Inserting these values into (5.115) and setting k = Ze2/4πϵ0, the energies of the
three-dimensional elliptical orbits are
E = −
Z2e4m
8ϵ2
0h2(nr + nθ + nφ)2 ,
(5.120)
exactly the same form of result as (5.23).
Let us now work out the frequencies νi associated with each independent coordinate.
From (5.91) and (5.92),
νi = ˙wi = ∂H
∂Ji
,
(5.121)
and so from (5.116), we ﬁnd
ν = ∂H
∂Jr
= ∂H
∂Jθ
= ∂H
∂Jφ
=
4π2mk2
(Jr + Jθ + Jφ)3 .
(5.122)
Thus, the frequencies are the same for all three independent coordinates, r, θ and φ.
These results are the basis of quantisation in the old quantum theory. The rules are as
follows:
r Quantisation in the φ-coordinate corresponds to quantising the projection of the angular
momentum onto some chosen axis, which we can choose to be the z-direction of a
Cartesian coordinate system. The quantisation rule is Jz = nφh/2π = mh/2π = m¯h,
where m came to be known as the magnetic quantum number for reasons to be discussed
later.
r The combined quantisation in the θ- and φ-coordinates is given by J = Jθ + Jφ =
(nθ + m)¯h. This can be written J = k¯h where k is known as the azimuthal quantum
number and deﬁnes the quantised total angular momentum.
r The quantisation in the radial r direction is given by (5.116)–(5.119) and corresponds
to Jr = (nr + nθ + m)¯h. The quantum number (nr + nθ + m) deﬁnes the total energy of
the orbit given by (5.120) and is known as the principal quantum number.6
We have concentrated upon the non-relativistic case of hydrogen-like atoms in which
the electron moves in a strictly inverse-square law electrostatic ﬁeld of force. For other
atoms, the ﬁeld experienced by the electron is generally not an inverse-square law and

Illustrating the motion of an electron in the x–yplane when the frequencies of oscillation are different in the x- and
y-directions (Sommerfeld, 1919).
then the frequencies of oscillation of the independent coordinates need not be the same.
In particular, they need not be related by the ratios of integers. In these cases, the overall
motion of the electron is not simply periodic, although each of the coordinates undergoes
simple periodic motion. When the associated frequencies are not all rational fractions of
each other, the motion is referred to as conditionally periodic. In the two-dimensional case
in Cartesian coordinates, conditionally periodic motion can be represented by Lissajou
ﬁgures as illustrated in Fig. 5.4. The motion of the electron is represented by oscillations
at slightly different frequencies in the x- and y-directions. If the ratio of frequencies is
a ratio of integers, the loci will eventually repeat, but in the more general case in which
the ratio can be irrational, the loci never join up and the loci will ﬁll the complete x–y
plane.
These were very considerable triumphs and many of these features will reappear in a
very different guise in the full quantum theory of Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger. In 1916,
the tools of action–angle variables were clearly the way ahead and these had already
been developed to a high degree of sophistication by the dynamical astronomers. These
techniques ﬂourished and became the preferred methods of the theoretical physicist. While
the model of the hydrogen atom was a triumph, the classical Bohr–Sommerfeld model ran
into almost insuperable difﬁculties with multi-electron systems. Fortunately, the techniques
for dealing with small perturbations to planetary orbits, which would result in slow changes
of conserved quantities as the system evolved, had been pioneered by the astronomers
and so these tools were available. They were to be used to great effect in understanding
the inﬂuence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds upon the Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the
atom.
5.6 Ehrenfest and the adiabatic principle
Ehrenfest was no admirer of quantum theory. As he remarked in a letter to Lorentz of
25 August 1913,

Sommerfeld and Ehrenfest
‘Bohr’s work on the quantum theory of the Balmer formula (in the Philosophical Maga-
zine) has driven me to despair. . . . If this is the way to reach the goal, I must give up doing
physics.’
Again in May 1916, following Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr model, he wrote to
Sommerfeld
‘Even though I consider it horrible that this success will help the preliminary, but still
incomplete monstrous Bohr model to new triumphs, I nevertheless heartily wish physics
at Munich further success along this path.’ (Klein, 1970)
Despite his reservations, Ehrenfest became deeply involved in issues in quantum physics
and, in particular, introduced the concept of adiabatic invariance into the formalism of the
old quantum theory.
The seeds of this concept were already present in the discussions at the 1911 Solvay
Conference. Lorentz raised the issue of whether or not a quantised pendulum whose string
is being shortened remained in a quantised state. Without hesitation, Einstein replied,
‘If the length of the pendulum is changed inﬁnitely slowly, its energy remains hν if it was
originally hν.’ (Einstein, 1912)
This is an example of adiabatic invariance. Sommerfeld carried out this calculation in his
book Atomic Spectra and Spectral Lines (1919). Let us repeat it here and clarify exactly
what Einstein meant. The pendulum has length l and the bob mass m. The instantaneous
angle from the vertical direction is φ, the maximum amplitude φ0 being assumed to be
small. The angular frequency of oscillation of the pendulum is then ω0 = 2πν0 = √g/l.
The tension S in the string is the sum of the gravitational and centripetal forces acting on
the bob and so
S = mg cos φ + ml ˙φ2 .
(5.123)
Now the length of the string is shortened very slowly so that there are many swings of the
pendulum as its length decreases by dl. The average work done in shortening the string by
dl is
dW = S |dl| = −mg cos φ dl −ml ˙φ2 dl ,
(5.124)
where the bars indicate averages taken over a period of the pendulum swing. The signs are
negative since the increment of length dl is negative. Taking the motion of the pendulum
to be
φ = φ0 sin(ω0t + γ ) ,
(5.125)
we ﬁnd

5.6 Ehrenfest and the adiabatic principle
The ﬁrst term in dW, −mgdl, is the work needed to raise the mean position of the bob by
dl while the second represents the increase in the average kinetic energy of motion of the
pendulum. The total energy is, as usual, twice the mean kinetic energy, E = 2Ekin, where
Ekin = m
2 l2 ˙φ2 = mgl φ2

4 .
(5.128)
Differentiating this expression, the change in total energy is
dE = mg φ2
0
2 dl + mglφ0 dφ0 .
(5.129)
Equating (5.129) to the work done in increasing the motion of the pendulum, the term
−mgφ2
0dl/4 from (5.127), we ﬁnd
−3
4φ0 dl = l dφ0 ,
(5.130)
and so, integrating,
3
4 logl = −log φ0 + constant ,
l3/4φ0 = constant .
(5.131)
Thus, as the string of the pendulum shortens, its angular amplitude increases, although
the physical amplitude of the swing decreases, x = φ0l ∝l1/4. Since g is a constant, the
frequency of oscillation increases as ω ∝l−1/2 We can now work out the relation between
the total energy of oscillation of the pendulum and its frequency from (5.128). We obtain
the key result
E
ν = constant .
(5.132)
This is what Einstein meant in his response to Lorentz.
The quantity E/ν is an example of an adiabatic invariant. Adiabatic invariance had been
in the literature in various guises since the understanding of the ﬁrst and second laws of
thermodynamics in the mid-1850s. In classical thermodynamics, adiabatic processes play
a central role in deﬁning the underlying structure of the theory. To emphasise this point,
let me repeat the description of what is involved in reversible adiabatic processes from my
treatment in Theoretical Concepts in Physics (Longair, 2003).
‘A reversible process is one which is carried out inﬁnitely slowly so that, in passing from
the state A to state B, the system passes through an inﬁnite number of equilibrium states.
Since the process takes place inﬁnitely slowly, there is no friction or turbulence and no
sound waves are generated. At no stage are there unbalanced forces. At each stage, we
make only an inﬁnitesimal change to the system. The implication is that, by reversing the
process precisely, we can get back to the point from which we started and nothing will
have changed in either the system or its surroundings. . . .
Let us emphasise this point by considering in detail how we could carry out a reversible
isothermal expansion. Suppose we have a large heat reservoir at temperature T and a
cylinder with gas in thermal contact with it also at temperature T . No heat ﬂows if the
two are at the same temperature. But if we make an inﬁnitesimally small movement of the
piston outwards, the gas in the cylinder cools inﬁnitesimally and so an inﬁnitesimal amount
of heat ﬂows into the gas by virtue of the temperature difference. This small amount of

Sommerfeld and Ehrenfest
energy brings the gas back to T . The system is reversible because, if we compress the gas
at T slightly, it heats up and heat ﬂows from the gas into the reservoir. Thus, provided we
consider only inﬁnitesimal changes, the heat ﬂow process occurs reversibly.
Clearly, this is not possible if the reservoir and the piston are at different temperatures.
In this case, we cannot reverse the direction of heat ﬂow by making an inﬁnitesimal change
in the temperature of the cooler object. This makes the important point that, in reversible
processes, the system must be able to evolve from one state to another by passing through
an inﬁnite set of equilibrium states which we join together by inﬁnitesimal increments of
work and energy ﬂow.
To reinforce this point, let us repeat the argument for an adiabatic expansion. The
cylinder is completely thermally isolated from the rest of the Universe. Again, we perform
each step inﬁnitesimally slowly. There is no ﬂow of heat in or out of the system and there
is no friction. Therefore, since each inﬁnitesimal step is reversible, we can perform the
whole expansion by adding lots of them together.’
In the case of a reversible adiabatic expansion, the pressure and volume are related
by the expression pV γ = constant, where γ is the ratio of the speciﬁc heat capacities
at constant pressure and constant volume respectively, γ = C p/CV . In terms of pressure
and temperature, pT γ/(γ −1) = constant. At all stages in the expansion, the system is in
thermal equilibrium at temperature T and so the total energy of the system is E = V ε,
where ε is the energy density of the gas. The relation between pressure and internal energy
density is p = (γ −1)ε and so, since pV = RT , the relation between the energy E and
the temperature T for one mole of gas is
E =
RT
γ −1 ,
that is,
E
T = constant .
(5.133)
This is a further example of an adiabatic invariant. But, we have seen this before. The
derivation of Wien’s displacement law described in Sect. 1.7.2 involved the use of two
adiabatic invariants. From (1.31) and (1.32), we ﬁnd that the total energy E = V ε, the
frequency ν and the temperature T are related by the invariants
E/ν = constant ,
ν/T = constant
and so
E/T = constant .
(5.134)
Ehrenfest’s interest in adiabatic invariance resulted from his perplexity about Planck’s
and Einstein’s derivation of the form of the Planck spectrum in which classical and quantum
concepts were mixed together. Ehrenfest’s concern was that the Stefan–Boltzmann law and
Wien’s displacement law are derived by purely classical arguments as we demonstrated in
Sects. 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 and yet the highly non-classical procedure of quantisation had to be
included to derive the correct form of the black-body spectrum. By 1913, Ehrenfest had
resolved the conundrum when he realised that the quantities which were quantised were
in fact adiabatic invariants (Ehrenfest, 1913). As shown by (5.134), E/ν is an invariant in
the adiabatic expansion of a gas of radiation. If the rule of quantisation is applied to this
adiabatic invariant, we immediately ﬁnd
E/ν = nh
where
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(5.135)
Thus, the rule of quantisation is preserved during the adiabatic expansion from T2 to T1.
Besides resolving Ehrenfest’s concern, it provided a new approach to the issue of which

5.6 Ehrenfest and the adiabatic principle
quantities were to be subject to the rules of quantisation. At the time, little attention was
paid to Ehrenfest’s ideas, but Bohr and Einstein recognised its importance. Einstein called
this approach to quantisation Ehrenfest’s adiabatic hypothesis, namely
‘If a system be affected in a reversible adiabatic way, allowed motions are transformed
into allowed motions.’
In his paper of 1916, Ehrenfest stated,
‘. . . the hypothesis gives restrictions to the arbitrariness which exists otherwise in the
introduction of the quanta.’ (Ehrenfest, 1916)
This paper of 1916 presented a much more general and abstract deﬁnition of the concept
of adiabatic invariance. In Ehrenfest’s words,
‘Let the coordinates of the system be denoted by q1, . . . , qn. The potential energy  may
contain besides the coordinates q certain ‘parameters’ a1, a2 . . . , the values of which
can be altered inﬁnitely slowly. The kinetic energy T may be a homogeneous quadratic
function of the velocities ˙q1, . . . , ˙qn, the coefﬁcients of which are functions of q and may
be of a1, a2, . . . . By changing the parameters from the values a1, a2, . . . to a′
1, a′
2, . . . in
an inﬁnitely slow way, a given motion β(a) is transformed into another motion β(a′).
This special type of inﬂuencing upon the system may be called “a reversible adiabatic
affection”, the motions β(a) and β(a′), “adiabatically related to each other.”’
This last statement means that the process must be a reversible adiabatic change.
This hypothesis immediately accounted for one of the remarkable results of Sommerfeld’s
development of the Bohr model of the atom, namely that the period of the quantised circular
and elliptical orbits of the same principal quantum number had the same energies and
frequencies. It could be shown that the model with circular orbits is adiabatically related, in
Ehrenfest’s sense, to elliptical orbits of the same frequency. Consequently, since E/ν is an
adiabatic invariant and equal to nh, it follows that the orbits must have the same energies.
The ﬁnal step in the argument concerned the appropriate sets of coordinates which
should be employed in applying the quantum conditions. The answer came from the studies
of Schwarzschild and Epstein whose papers were concerned with the Stark effect, but
which contained within them the correct answer (Schwarzschild, 1916; Epstein, 1916a).
The answer was that, for systems of dynamical equations which were separable, the quantum
conditions should be applied in the action–angle coordinates discussed in Sects. 5.4.4 and
5.5. Speciﬁcally, they showed that the action variables J are the quantities to be identiﬁed
with adiabatic invariants and that these lead directly to Sommerfeld’s quantum conditions
(5.117)–(5.119). It is now clear why Planck referred to h as the quantum of action.
These results led to a great deal of mathematical study of the conditions under which the
dynamical equations would be separable and also to the issue of the degeneracy of the orbits
in the non-relativistic Bohr–Sommerfeld model. Burgers, a student and then collaborator
of Ehrenfest’s at Leiden, went on to study the conditions under which the quantisation
rules should be applied to systems in which the Hamiltonian is time-variable, that is, the

The conditions are not dissimilar from those for the time-independent equation and in
addition he showed that the action variables J are adiabatic invariants (Burgers, 1916).
These analyses provided the framework for the more detailed study of quantum phenomena,
in particular the Zeeman and Stark effects which are discussed in Chap. 7.
5.7 The developing infrastructure of quantum theory
After only a few years, Bohr’s dramatic insight into the nature of quantum phenomena in
atoms and molecules had been placed on a much more secure theoretical foundation. The
apparent arbitrariness of the quantum conditions had been replaced by the understanding that
the quantities which had to be quantised were the adiabatic invariants of classical physics.
Furthermore, the appropriate mathematical tools for treating quantised systems had been
established – the action–angle variables of the transformation theory of mechanics, which
were derived from Hamiltonian mechanics and dynamics. This mathematical technique,
which had been developed for applications in celestial mechanics, suddenly became the
tool of choice of theorists for the study of quantum problems. This brought with it the
full apparatus of higher mechanics which was to become the bread and butter of the
theoretical physicist. These developments had a long-range impact upon quantum theory
since many of the mathematical techniques were to ﬁnd application in somewhat different
guises when Heisenberg’s and Schr¨odinger’s versions of the theory of quantum processes
were enunciated.
The exploitation of this newly won understanding was the immediate goal of the theorists
who still had a long way to go before the theory could account for the details of quantum
phenomena.

principle and the first selection rules
6.1 The problem of transitions between stationary states
The understanding of adiabatic invariants as the quantities which are subject to the Bohr–
Sommerfeld quantisation conditions and their mathematical description through Hamilton–
Jacobi theory and action-angle variables provided the tools for determining the energies
of stationary states of quantum systems and hence the frequencies of the radiation emitted
in transitions between them. The theory had, however, nothing to say about the phys-
ical processes by which the transitions take place nor about the intensities and polar-
isations of the resulting radiation. Bohr proposed to address these issues through his
correspondence principle. In simple terms, the principle states that in the limit of large
quantum numbers, when n ≪n, the radiation processes between stationary states should
approach the classical results derived from Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic radia-
tion and so provide information about the intensity and polarisation properties of the
radiation.
This correspondence principle had already been foreshadowed in Planck’s theory of
the spectrum of black-body radiation of 1900. The expression for the equilibrium energy
density of radiation in an enclosure at temperature T , derived in Sect. 2.6, is
u(ν) = 8πhν3
c3
1
ehν/kT −1 .
(6.1)
In Planck’s derivation of this result, it was assumed that the energy levels of the oscillators
are quantised for the emission of radiation throughout the electromagnetic spectrum and
yet, at frequencies hν ≪kT , (6.1) reduces to the classical formula, the Rayleigh–Jeans
law,
u(ν) = 8πhν3
c3
1
ehν/kT −1 →8πν2
c3
kT .
(6.2)
This expression was derived by Rayleigh using purely classical arguments, as shown in
Sect. 2.3.4. This result was to be elaborated by Bohr into his correspondence principle, but
before that Einstein made a crucial advance in tackling the issue of quantum transitions
from a probabilistic perspective.

6.2 Onthequantumtheoryofradiation (Einstein 1916)
During the years 1911–1916, Einstein was fully preoccupied with the formulation of general
relativity, one of the most remarkable intellectual achievements in the history of physics.
Following the 1911 Solvay Conference, he wrote relatively little about quantum physics
until he returned to the origin of the spectrum of black-body radiation in 1916. As recounted
in Chaps. 4 and 5, by that time, the general opinion had shifted in favour of the view that
quanta and quantum theory had to be taken seriously in understanding the physics of atoms.
It is important to recall that Einstein’s proposal of 1905 that light is composed of discrete
quanta was signiﬁcantly more revolutionary than Planck’s introduction of quantisation
which only applied to the sources of the radiation. The quotations from the writings of
Planck in 1907 and Lorentz in 1909 in Sect. 3.6 indicate that they preferred to think of the
emission, absorption and propagation of radiation strictly in terms of Maxwell’s classical
electromagnetic theory. In contrast, Einstein never deviated from his belief in the reality
of light quanta. His paper on ﬂuctuations in the intensity of black-body radiation described
in Sect. 3.6 was an example of this continuing pursuit. The paper of 1916 was a further
contribution to his crusade to convince his colleagues of the reality of light quanta. The paper
is best remembered today for its introduction of what are now known as Einstein’s A and B
coefﬁcients but it also introduces concepts which were to be important in the development
of the theory of quanta, particularly the introduction of transition probabilities.
Following Bohr’s pioneering efforts of 1913, the emphasis of quantum physics shifted
to the understanding of the details of atomic spectra as discussed in Chaps. 4 and 5.
Let us look at Einstein’s paper of 1916 in a little detail (Einstein, 1916). He begins by
noting the formal similarity between the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the velocity
distribution of the molecules in a gas and Planck’s formula for the black-body spectrum.
Einstein shows how these distributions can be reconciled through his new derivation of the
Planck spectrum, which gives insight into what he refers to as the ‘still unclear processes
of emission and absorption of radiation by matter.’ The paper begins with a description of
a quantum system consisting of a large number of molecules which can occupy a discrete
set of states Z1, Z2, Z3, . . . with corresponding energies ε1, ε2, ε3, . . . . According to
classical statistical mechanics, the relative probabilities Wn of these states being occupied
in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature T are given by Boltzmann’s relation
Wn = gn exp

−εn
kT

,
(6.3)
where the gn are the statistical weights, or degeneracies, of the states Zn, meaning the
number of states with exactly the same energy εn. As Einstein remarks in his paper
‘[(6.3)] expresses the farthest-reaching generalisation of Maxwell’s velocity distribution
law.’
Consider two quantum states of the gas molecules, Zm and Zn with energies εm and
εn respectively, such that εm > εn. Bohr’s model associates the frequency of the radiation
emitted in such a transition as hν = εm −εn, but the mechanism by which this takes place is

6.2 Onthequantumtheoryofradiation (Einstein 1916)
not speciﬁed. According to Einstein’s picture, the transition is associated with the emission
of a quantum of radiation of energy hν, which for convenience we will refer to as a photon.1
Similarly, when a photon of energy hν is absorbed, the molecule changes from the state
Zn to Zm. Einstein’s aim was to develop a purely quantum approach to the emission and
absorption of radiation.
The quantum description of these processes follows by analogy with the classical pro-
cesses of the emission and absorption of radiation – Jammer (1989) remarks that this is an
early manifestation of what was to be embodied in Bohr’s correspondence principle.
r Induced emission and absorption By analogy with the classical case, if an oscillator is
excited by waves of the same frequency ν as the oscillator, it either gains or loses energy,
depending upon the phase of the wave relative to that of the oscillator, that is, the work
done on the oscillator can be either positive or negative. The magnitude of the positive
or negative work done is proportional to the energy density u of the incident waves with
frequency ν. The quantum mechanical equivalents of these processes are those of induced
absorption, in which the molecule absorbs the photon and is consequently excited from
the state Zn to Zm, and induced emission, in which the molecule emits a photon under the
inﬂuence of the incident radiation ﬁeld. The probabilities of these processes are written
Induced absorption
dW = Bm
n u dt ,
Induced emission
dW = Bn
mu dt .
The lower indices refer to the initial state and the upper indices to the ﬁnal state. Bm
n and
Bn
m are constants for a particular pair of energy states, and are referred to as coefﬁcients
associated with ‘changes of state by induced absorption and emission’.
r Spontaneous emission Einstein noted that an electric dipole oscillator emits radiation
‘spontaneously’ in the absence of excitation by an external ﬁeld. The corresponding
process at the quantum level is called spontaneous emission, the probability of the
emission of a photon taking place in the time interval dt without external causes being
dW = An
m dt .
(6.4)
Here Einstein used the analogy with the radioactive decay law, N = N0 exp(−αt), in
which the nucleus decays spontaneously. This can be interpreted in terms of a probability
of a decay occurring in the time interval dt by the rule p(t) dt = α dt. He remarked,
‘One can hardly think of it in any other way except as a radioactive reaction.’
We now seek the spectrum of the energy density of radiation u(ν) in thermal equilibrium.
The relative numbers of molecules with energies εm and εn in thermal equilibrium are given
by the Boltzmann relation (6.3) and so, in order to leave the equilibrium distribution un-
changed under the processes of spontaneous and induced emission and induced absorption
of radiation, the probabilities must balance, that is,

Once An

immediately. Einstein wrote exuberantly to his friend Michele Besso on 11 August 1916,
‘A splendid ﬂash came to me concerning the absorption and emission of radiation . . . A
surprisingly simple derivation of Planck’s formula, I would say the derivation. Everything
completely quantum.’
This important analysis occupies only the ﬁrst three sections of Einstein’s paper. The
remainder of the paper concerns the transfer of momentum as well as energy between
matter and radiation. We will not go through the details of the argument, but summarise its
physical content. According to standard kinetic theory, when molecules collide in a gas in
thermal equilibrium, there are ﬂuctuations in the momentum transfer between molecules
which amounts to
2
τ
= 2RkT ,
(6.11)
where  is the momentum transfer to a molecule during a short time interval τ and R is a
constant related to the ‘frictional’ force acting upon the moving molecules. Note the striking
similarity with Einstein’s famous formula (3.1) for the diffusion of microscopic particles
undergoing Brownian motion. Now suppose the density of atoms is reduced to an extremely
low value so that the momentum transfer is dominated by collisions between photons and
the few remaining atoms, which can be considered collisionless. According to Einstein’s

6.3 Bohr’s correspondence principle
quantum hypothesis, the photons have energy hν and momentum hν/c. Therefore, the
particles should be brought into thermal equilibrium at temperature T entirely through
collisions between photons and particles. This was the reason that Einstein needed his
equations for spontaneous emission and induced absorption and emission of radiation
since these determine the transfer of energy and, more important in the present context,
momentum between the particles and the radiation. In the rest of the paper of 1916, Einstein
showed that, assuming the momentum transfers occur randomly in directional collisions
between photons and electrons, the variance of the ﬂuctuations in the momentum transfer
is exactly the same expression as (6.11). This could not happen if the energy re-radiated
by the particles was isotropic because then there would be no random component in the
momentum transfer process. The key result was that, when a molecule emits or absorbs a
quantum hν, there must be a positive or negative change in the momentum of the molecule
of magnitude |hν/c|, even in the case of spontaneous emission. In Einstein’s words,
‘Outgoing radiation in the form of spherical waves does not exist. During the elementary
process of radiative loss, the molecule suffers a recoil of magnitude hν/c in a direction
which is determined only by “chance”, according to the present state of the theory.’
His view of the importance of the calculation is summarised in the version of the paper
published in 1917.
‘The most important thing seems to me to be the momenta transferred to the molecule
[atom] in the processes of absorption and emission. If any of our assumptions concerning
the transferred momenta were changed [(6.11)] would be violated. It hardly seems possible
to reach agreement with this relation, which is demanded by the [kinetic] theory of heat,
in any other way than on the basis of our assumption.’
Direct experimental evidence for the correctness of Einstein’s conclusion was only obtained
in 1923 from Compton’s X-ray scattering experiments (Compton, 1923). These showed
that photons undergo collisions in which they behave like particles, the Compton effect
or Compton scattering. It is a standard result of special relativity that the increase in
wavelength of a photon in collision with a stationary electron is
λ′ −λ =
hc
mec2 (1 −cos θ) ,
(6.12)
where θ is the angle through which the photon is scattered.2 Implicit in this calculation is
the conservation of relativistic three-momentum in which the momentum of the photon is
hν/c.

a profound impression upon Bohr who saw a way of relating the spontaneous transition

the correspondence principle. Allusion has already been made in Sect. 6.1 to the result that
the Planck spectrum reduces to the classical Rayleigh–Jeans formula in the limit of very low
frequencies. In addition, Bohr had shown that the same equivalence applied to transitions
between states of very large quantum numbers n for which the emitted frequencies are also
very low. Let us ﬁrst demonstrate this result for the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom with
circular orbits.
We showed in Sect. 4.5 that the kinetic energy of an electron in a state with principal
quantum number n is
T = 1
2mev2 =
mee4
8ϵ2
0n2h2 ,
(6.13)
from which it follows that the velocity of the electron in its circular orbit is given by
v2 =
e4
4ϵ2
0n2h2 .
(6.14)
The frequency of rotation of the electron about the nucleus νe is
νe =
v
2πr =
v2
2πvr = mev2
2π J = T
π J ,
(6.15)
where J = nh/2π is the quantised angular momentum of the electron. Therefore,
νe =
mee4
4ϵ2
0h3n3 .
(6.16)
Let us now work out the frequency of emission of radiative transitions between stationary
states with large values of n, the principal quantum number according to the Bohr picture.
From (4.28), we ﬁnd
ν = mee4
8ϵ2
0h3
 1
n2 −
1
(n + n)2

,
(6.17)
where n ≪n is the difference in principal quantum number between the upper and lower
states. We can therefore carry out a Taylor expansion of the term in (n + n)−2 and ﬁnd
that
ν =
mee4
4ϵ2
0h2n3 n .
(6.18)
Now, n = 1, 2, . . . and so we ﬁnd that the frequency of rotation (6.16) is exactly equal to
the emission frequency of the transition for n = 1, ν = νe. Thus, in this simplest case, we
see that there is an exact correspondence between the frequency of rotation of the electron
in its orbit about the nucleus, which classically gives rise to electromagnetic radiation
at the orbital frequency of the electron, and the frequency associated with the difference
in energies of the quantised stationary states of the electron. This is the feature which
Bohr exploited in his correspondence principle. His proposal was to use the theory of the
electromagnetic radiation of the orbiting electron according to Maxwell’s electromagnetic
theory to determine the intensity and polarisation properties of the emission lines according
to quantum theory.

125
6.3 Bohr’s correspondence principle
Notice another important feature of (6.18). The frequencies of lines with n =
2, 3, 4, . . . are exact harmonics of the orbital frequency νe, in other words, ν = τνe, where
τ = n takes the values τ = 2, 3, 4, . . . . This will prove to be an important result in the
transition from classical to quantum mechanics (Sect. 10.3).
The above argument can be readily extended to more general orbits using the action–
angle variables introduced in Sects. 5.4 and 5.5. It is immediately apparent from (5.122)
that the quantum frequency ν for non-relativistic elliptical orbits for hydrogen-like atoms
follows exactly the same quantum rules as for circular orbits, where the principal quantum
number is (nr + nθ + nφ) in the notation of Sect. 5.5. In his major paper of 1918, Bohr
established this equivalence in the following way (Bohr, 1918a). According to the formalism
of action–angle variables, (5.121) states that the frequency associated with the k coordinate
of a periodic, or more generally conditionally periodic, system is
νk = ∂H
∂Jk
= ∂E
∂Jk
,
(6.19)
where Jk is the action variable associated with the k coordinate and H the Hamiltonian,
which is just the total energy E. This can be compared with the quantum expressions
hνq = E ,
Jk = (n′
k −nk)h = τkh ,
(6.20)
where n′
k and nk are the principal quantum numbers describing the states before and after
the transition and τk takes the values 1, 2, . . . . In the limit of large quantum numbers, in
which the energy differences between neighbouring states are small, we can replace the
differences in E and Jk between states by their partial differentials, that is,
E
Jk
≈∂E
∂Jk
.
(6.21)
This relation encapsulates Bohr’s correspondence principle, the left-hand side being quan-
tum and the right-hand side classical. Therefore,
hνq = E = E
Jk
Jk ≈
 ∂E
∂Jk

Jk = τkνkh .
(6.22)
In other words, νq = τkνk. For the case τ = 1, we recover the exact equivalence between
the classical and the quantum results.
There is also an equivalence for higher harmonics of νk in the classical theory as well.
The values of τk > 1 correspond to harmonics of the fundamental frequency νk and this
has a counterpart in the classical theory of the emission of electromagnetic radiation of an
electron in orbit about the nucleus at frequency ν. The necessary tools have already been
described in Sect. 2.3.1. In particular, from (2.3), the average rate of radiation of a dipole
of dipole moment p0 = ex0 oscillating at angular frequency ω0 is

Therefore, the procedure is to decompose the periodic motion of the electron in its orbit
into a complete set of orthogonal dipoles and this is achieved by describing the motion in
terms of Fourier series.

emits a series of lines with frequencies ω, 2ω, . . . and the intensity of each line is given by
(6.23) with the dipole moment p0 being given by Dτ = eCτ. In other words, the intensities
of the lines are determined by the squares of the absolute values of the Fourier components
|Dτ|2. Bohr concluded
‘We must therefore expect that for large values of n, these coefﬁcients will on the quantum
theory determine the probability of spontaneous transition from a given stationary state
for which n = n′ to a neighbouring state for which n = n′′ = n′ −τ.’ (Bohr, 1918a)
Bohr had already noted that this result would be obtained in the case of an electron
moving in an elliptical orbit about the nucleus:
‘The possibility of an emission of a radiation of such a frequency may also be interpreted
from analogy with ordinary electrodynamics, as an electron rotating around a nucleus
in an elliptical orbit will emit a radiation which according to Fourier’s theorem can be
resolved into homogeneous components, the frequencies of which are τω, if ω is the
frequency of revolution of the electron.’ (Bohr, 1913b)
This was only the beginning of the story. In general, the orbits of the electrons will
not be simple ellipses because the electric ﬁeld is not a purely 1/r potential when other
electrons are present and so the motion is conditionally periodic rather than periodic. In
two dimensions, the motion can be visualised as shown in Fig. 5.4. Therefore, we need the
general k-dimensional Fourier series for general conditionally periodic motion. In Bohr’s
notation, the coordinates of the conditionally periodic system are q1, q2, . . . , qs and so the
displacement ξ of the particles in any direction can be expressed as a function of time by
what Bohr calls an ‘s-double inﬁnite Fourier series’ of the form
ξ =

Cτ1, τ2,...,τs cos 2π[(τ1ω1 + · · · + τsωs)t + cτ1, τ2,...,τs] ,
(6.26)
where the sum extends over all positive and negative values of τs and each ω is the
mean frequency of oscillation of each independent coordinate qk. The values of Cτ1, τ2,...,τs
depend upon the constants of motion αi derived from the Hamilton–Jacobi equations, such
as those described by (5.100)–(5.103). Notice that, unlike the degenerate elliptical orbits, in
general, ω1 ̸= ω2 ̸= · · · ̸= ωs, and so the ωs are not simply related to each other by ratios of

6.4 The first selection rules
integers. Notice also that the Fourier series contains not only harmonics of each fundamental
frequency ωk, but also ‘cross-terms’ (τkωk + τlωl) which correspond to coupling between
independent modes of oscillation.
Bohr’s insight was that the spontaneous transition probability An
m should be identiﬁed
with the dipole moments of the corresponding Fourier components of (6.26). Thus, if we
write the dipole moment associated with the transition n →m as Dn→m = eCn→m, we
equate the classical radiation formula (6.23) to the spontaneous emission luminosity of a
single electron transition,
An
mhν = ω4
n→m|Dn→m|2
12πϵ0c3
.
(6.27)
Therefore,
An
m = ω3
n→m
6ϵ0c3h |Dn→m|2 .
(6.28)
Strictly speaking, these correspondences should only apply for transitions n between
stationary states with large values of n such that n ≫n. Bohr, however, had little hesitation
in applying the correspondence principle to small values of n as well. In addition to
interpreting the intensity and polarisation properties of the emissions lines, the principle
also led to the concept of selection rules.
6.4 The first selection rules
The expression (6.26) indicates that there are very large numbers of stationary states and
correspondingly an even greater number of possible transitions, but not all of these are
realised in nature. In his paper of 1918, Bohr enunciated the ﬁrst selection rules which
would limit the number of permitted transitions between stationary states. Clearly, if the
Fourier component Dn→m in (6.28) is zero, the probability of the transition is zero and the
transition is forbidden for such electric dipole transitions.
Let us consider ﬁrst the case of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Because the
system is periodic, we can simplify the Fourier series (6.26) by writing
p = 1

τ=−∞
Dτ exp (iτω0t) ,
(6.29)
where the factor 1/2 is included since the summation spans the range −∞< τ < +∞.
The time variation of the dipole moment of the oscillator is harmonic and so

one cycle of the oscillation. The only Fourier components which are non-zero are those

Therefore, the expression for the spontaneous transition probability is

(6.33)
using the relation ω0 = 2πν0, the transition probability can also be written
An
m =
ω2
0e2
6πϵ0mc3 n .
(6.34)
These are rather remarkable properties of the quantised harmonic oscillator. It can be
seen that, because of the equal spacings between the energy levels and the selection rule
n = ±1, for all transitions, the frequency of the emitted radiation is exactly equal to that of
the oscillator for all permitted transitions. Notice also that although Bohr’s correspondence
principle was intended only to provide an estimate of the radiation rate for high energy
levels, the results hold true for transitions between all energy levels of the harmonic
oscillator. As remarked by Jammer (1989), these remarkable features of the quantised
harmonic oscillator are fortunate features of the early conceptual development of quantum
theory. In his pioneering investigations of 1900, Planck had assumed that the quantisation of
the harmonic oscillator resulted in equal energy differences between the energy levels and
that these differences corresponded to the frequency of the oscillator through the relations
E = ε = hν and ν = ν0. Notice also that this equally spaced quantum ‘ladder’ is found
because the oscillation is harmonic and so derived from a harmonic potential.
The same procedure was adopted by Bohr for transitions between the stationary states of
atoms. The transition probabilities are associated with the amplitudes of the components
of the Fourier series, but now the transitions in each of the r, θ and φ coordinates had to be
considered. Let us consider the simplest case of hydrogen-like atoms in which the orbits of
the electrons are ellipses, the periods of electrons with the same principal quantum number
n being ﬁxed. The solution of this problem was discussed in Sect. 5.5, the energy levels
being given by (5.120) and the frequencies associated with the three orthogonal coordinates
r, θ and φ given by (5.122) being all the same, namely,
E = −

νr = νθ = νφ =
4π2mk2
(Jr + Jθ + Jφ)3 .
(6.35)
Bohr pointed out in his paper of 1918 that in this case, the quantisation rules derived for
the harmonic oscillator also apply since there is only a single frequency associated with
the transition, just as in (6.30). Therefore similar selection rules apply, but now all three
quantum numbers need to be considered.

6.5 The polarisation of quantised radiation
The simplest approach is that presented by ter Haar (1967). The dipole moment can be
resolved into components along the x-, y- and z-directions as follows:
Px = er cos φ sin θ ,
(6.36)
Py = er sin φ sin θ ,
(6.37)
Pz = er cos θ ,
(6.38)
where (r, θ, φ) are standard spherical polar coordinates. The terms in θ and φ can be
written in the form e±iθ and e±iφ. For the case of hydrogen-like atoms, these factors as a
function of time t can be written in the form
eiφ(t) =

τ
Aτ e±iτωφt ∝e±iωφt,
(6.39)
eiθ(t) =

τ
Bτ e±iτωθt ∝e±iωθt ,
(6.40)
where Aτ and Bτ can be written in the same form of Fourier series as (6.29) and ωφ =
2πνφ = ωθ = 2πνθ = 2πνr. Just as in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the only terms
of the Fourier expansions which are non-zero are those with τ = ±1 and so the selection
rule for the quantum number in the θ-coordinate is
nθ = ±1 .
(6.41)
A similar result applies for the φ-component, but in addition, since there is no dependence
of pz on φ, νφ = 0 and so the selection rule nφ = 0 is also allowed. Therefore, for the
φ-component, the quantisation conditions are:
nφ = 0, ±1 .
(6.42)
Bohr went on to show that these quantisation rules also apply to the case in which the
frequencies νr, νθ and νφ are different, the case of conditionally periodic orbits. Thus,
by using the correspondence principle, Bohr was able to reduce the number of possible
transitions between stationary states to those which satisﬁed the above selection rules for
electric dipole transitions.
6.5 The polarisation of quantised radiation and selection rules
Further insight into the origin of the selection rules came from considerations of the
polarisation properties of the radiation emitted in quantum transitions. The basic premise
of the Bohr–Sommerfeld model of atoms is that the angular momenta of stationary states
are quantised in units of h/2π. In the simplest model with circular orbits, when a transition
occurs, there is a change in the energy of the electron in the atom hν and a corresponding
change in angular momentum h/2π. The angular momentum is transferred to the emitted
radiation. Bohr and Sommerfeld appreciated that since the radiation is quantised, there must
be selection rules which determine which transitions between stationary states can result in
electric dipole radiation.

Einstein coefficients
The application of the correspondence principle to the conservation of angular mo-
mentum in the emission of radiation was worked out by Sommerfeld’s assistant Adalbert
Rubinowicz and published in an important paper of 1918 (Rubinowicz, 1918a). Sommer-
feld’s exposition in Chapter 5 of his book Atomic Structure and Spectral Lines (1919)
provides a wonderful review of the problems of reconciling the classical and quantum
pictures of the process of emission of radiation by atoms which confronted the pioneers of
quantum theory. Rubinowicz’s approach to the emission of an electron in a general elliptical
orbit about the nucleus was adopted. They considered the radiation of a three-dimensional
dipole P which has components
px = a exp (iα) ,
(6.43)
P = p exp (iωt) ,
p = px + py + pz ,
py = b exp (iβ) ,
(6.44)
pz = c exp (iγ ) .
(6.45)
The amplitudes of the dipole in the x-, y- and z-directions are a, b and c and the phases of
the oscillators are determined by the quantities α, β and γ . If α = β = γ = 0, the dipole
is a linear oscillator with axis in the direction of P. A dipole rotating about the z-axis in
the x–y plane could be described by a = b, c = 0, α = 0, β = ±π/2.
The properties of the radiation of an oscillating dipole were described in Sect. 2.3.1.
More speciﬁcally, in the far ﬁeld limit, the instantaneous electric ﬁeld of the radiation is
given by
Eθ = | ¨p| sin θ
4πε0c2r .
(6.46)
The rate of energy ﬂow per unit area per second at distance r is given by the magnitude of
the Poynting vector S = E × H = E2
θ/Z0 ir, where Z0 = (μ0/ε0)1/2 is the impedance of
free space. The rate of energy ﬂow through the area r2 d subtended by solid angle d at

To ﬁnd the total radiation rate −dE/dt, we integrate over solid angle. Because of the
symmetry of the emitted intensity with respect to the acceleration vector, we can integrate

6.5 The polarisation of quantised radiation
energy loss rate is given by the Poynting vector ﬂux which is radial. This energy also
transfers the momentum of the waves to inﬁnity, the momentum ﬂow rate per unit area per
second being S/c. However, because of the symmetry of the emitted radiation, there is no
overall momentum loss by the particle. These results remain true for a linear oscillator and
for the rotating dipole.
There is, however, a difference in the case of the angular momentum, or the moment of
the momentum, of the radiation ﬁeld. The momentum per unit volume at distance r from
the dipole is S/c2 and so the moment of the momentum of the emitted radiation is
M = r ×
 S
c2

.
(6.50)
This quantity has to be integrated over all space. This calculation is carried out by Som-
merfeld in Appendix 9 of his book. In the case in which the dipole rotates about the z-axis
in the x–y plane, the angular momentum of the radiation transferred per unit time is
Nz = W
ω
2ab sin γ
a2 + b2
,
(6.51)
where W is the total energy radiated by the orbiting electron and γ = β −α is the phase
difference between the oscillations in the x- and y-directions. Let us check that this result
makes sense. In the cases in which only one component of the oscillator is present, say
b = 0, there is evidently no net angular momentum in the radiation, as would be expected
from the symmetry of the radiated emission. Likewise, if γ = 0 so that the oscillations in
the x- and y-directions are in phase, there is no angular momentum since the particle is a
linear oscillator at some ﬁxed angle in the x–y plane. If, however, the phase difference is
±π/2 and a = b, the quantity 2ab sin γ/(a2 + b2) takes maximum and minimum values
of ±1. These values correspond to circular polarisation in opposite senses when viewed
along the z-direction. Notice that these results are no more than the law of conservation
of angular momentum for the emission of radiation. An electron in a circular orbit, for
example, loses angular momentum as it radiates away energy and this is transferred to the
radiation ﬁeld which takes away the angular momentum as circularly polarised radiation.
Sommerfeld now translates these classical results to the quantum emission of radiation.
The energy removed in the quantum emission of radiation is W = hν and so, since ω = 2πν,
Nz = h

Now, according to the rules for the quantisation of angular momentum Jφ = nφh/2π and
so, when a quantum transition nφ is made,
Jφ = h
2π nφ .
(6.53)
Equating (6.52) and (6.53), we ﬁnd
nφ = 2ab sin γ

Now, we have just shown that the extremal values of the right-hand side of (6.53) are ±1
and so the only possible integral values of nφ are
nφ = +1 ,
nφ = −1 ,
nφ = 0 .
(6.55)
Sommerfeld’s analysis resulted in two key results for the quantum emission of atoms:
r The rule of selection states: the azimuthal quantum number can at most alter by one
unit at a time in changes of conﬁguration of the atom.
r The rule of polarisation demands that if the azimuthal quantum number alters by ±1,
the light is circularly polarised; if the quantum number remains constant, the light is
linearly polarised.
As we will discuss in the next chapter, Rubinowicz was to apply these concepts to the
understanding of the Stark and Zeeman effects in hydrogen and other atoms with some
success (Rubinowicz, 1918b).
Thus, Bohr’s and Rubinowicz’s somewhat different approaches resulted in the same
result that there are necessarily selection rules which determine which transitions in atoms
are to be permitted. Note that there is an important difference between their approaches.
Bohr worked exclusively in terms of the correspondence principle in which the transitions
between states were subject to the quantum rules and the selection rules were found by
analogy. In his picture, the radiation of the atoms themselves was determined by Maxwell’s
equations. In contrast, Rubinowicz considered both the atoms and the radiation to be part
of a single quantum system, as he described in his paper of 1921 (Rubinowicz, 1921). His
analysis endowed the emitted photons with energy and angular momentum.
6.6 The Rydberg series and the quantum defect
The Bohr model of the atom could successfully account in considerable detail for the
spectral properties of the hydrogen atom, but atoms with more than one electron were a
much greater challenge. Nonetheless, the fact that the Rydberg series of atoms such as
sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and zinc had similar forms to that of the hydrogen
atom, as illustrated by the Rydberg formulae (1.19)–(1.21), suggested that the same general
principles were involved. It is striking, for example, that the spectrum of sodium is similar
to that of hydrogen. What was needed was a suitable form for the electrostatic potential
experienced by an electron in the combined ﬁeld of the nucleus and the other orbiting
electrons.
Sommerfeld tackled this problem in his book Atomic Structure and Spectral Lines (1919)
by adopting a more general form for the electrostatic potential experienced by the electron.

6.6 The Rydberg series and the quantum defect
where the scale a is chosen to be the radius of the ﬁrst circular Bohr orbit, a = h2ϵ0/πmee2.
Assuming the electron moves in a planar orbit deﬁned by the coordinates r, φ in this central
electrostatic potential, the analysis is exactly the same as in Sect. 5.5, but now the potential
term k/r in (5.104) and similar formulae is replaced by (6.56). Thus, the quantisation
condition for φ takes the usual form pφ = nφh/2π. In the radial coordinate, Sommerfeld
showed that, including only the ﬁrst additional term in c1 and carrying out the same type
of integration which resulted in (5.116), the expression for the energies of the stationary
states of the electron are of the form
E = −
R∞
(nr + nφ + d) ,
(6.57)
where d = Zc1/n3. Thus, the additional term in d depends upon the nature of the additional
term in the potential. Similar results were obtained when the next term in c2 was included
in the expression for the electrostatic potential. Evidently, the inclusion of these additional
terms leads to energy levels of the type needed to account for the Rydberg formulae
(1.19)–(1.21).
The origin of this modiﬁcation to the standard Bohr formula can be understood from
the argument presented by ter Haar (1967). Considering for illustration the example of
the sodium atom, the Bohr–Sommerfeld picture would involve a nucleus with charge 11e,
surrounded by 11 orbiting electrons. If a single electron is responsible for the spectral line,
we can consider its motion in the combined ﬁeld of the nucleus and the other 10 electrons.
The potential due to the 10 other electrons can be represented by a spherically symmetric
central ﬁeld of force, an assumption which was to ﬁnd some justiﬁcation in the shell model
of the electron distribution in atoms. Therefore, when the electron is far from the nucleus,
it experiences a potential −e2/4πϵ0r as the nucleus is shielded from all but 1/11 of the
nuclear charge. On the other hand, when close to the nucleus, the electron experiences the
full nuclear electrostatic potential, −11e2/4πϵ0r.
The speciﬁc form of the potential is not known, but we can derive the general features of
the solution from the following line of reasoning. To ﬁnd the energy of the stationary states,
we need to ﬁnd the integral equivalent to (5.110) which was evaluated for a pure inverse-
square law electrostatic potential. Replacing the term 2mk/r by the general potential term
2mU(r), the action integral becomes,
Jr =
# +
2mE + 2mU(r) −α2
θ
r2 dr ,
(6.58)
since, according to classical mechanics, the radial component of the momentum of the
electron is given by the expression
p2
r = 2mU(r) −α2
θ
r2 + 2mE .
(6.59)
For the case of a pure inverse-square law of electrostatic attraction, U(r) = k/r and then
the motion of the electron can be represented by a diagram in which the square of the radial
momentum is plotted against distance from the nucleus (Fig. 6.1a). The total energy of the
bound orbit is E and is a negative quantity. At the points rmin and rmax, the radial component

of the momentum goes to zero since all the momentum is then in the azimuthal component
and the integral (6.58) is taken between these limits. Correspondingly, the radial motion of
the electron can be represented on a pr–r diagram which is shown in Fig. 6.1b.
Now, the quantisation condition is
Jr =
#
pr dr = nrh ,
(6.60)
and so this integral corresponds to the area bounded by the locus in the pr–r relation shown
in Fig. 6.1b. In other words, whatever the shape of the locus in the pr–r plane, the area is
quantised in units of h. Let us now consider the case of the sodium atom. At large radii,
the locus will have the same form as the hydrogen atom since it only feels a net single
electronic charge. Close to the nucleus, the potential will be much deeper since the charge
of the nucleus is 11e. Therefore, we would expect the p2
r –r relation to extend much closer
to the nucleus, as illustrated in the comparison of the U(r) ∝1/r potential and the potential
felt by the electron in the sodium atom in Fig. 6.2(i). The corresponding quantities in the
pr–r plane are shown in Fig. 6.2(ii). Now, the quantisation conditions for Jr for the sodium
atom is that the area enclosed by the locus (b) in Fig. 6.2(ii) is equal to nrh. This area is
equal to the area enclosed by the locus for the hydrogen atom plus the shaded area which
must be some fraction α of the total area. Therefore, we can write the quantisation condition

6.7 Towards a more complete quantum theory of atoms
Over a matter of a few years, Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom had been given a much
more secure theoretical basis. The models of atoms were now fully three dimensional and
the correspondence principle offered a route to understanding the intensity and polarisation
properties of the emission of atoms. The selection rules limited the numbers of allowed
transitions between stationary states. Despite the continuing concern about the incompat-
ibilities between the quantum and classical pictures, there was optimism that these ideas
provided the basis for the development of a more complete quantum theory of atoms.
The subtle use of the correspondence principle was behind many of the successes of the
theory. Sommerfeld remarked that the correspondence principle was like,
‘a magic wand that allowed the results of classical wave theory to be of use for the quantum
theory.’

establishment of modern quantum mechanics. . . . In fact, there was rarely in the history
of physics a comprehensive theory which owed so much to one principle as quantum
mechanics owed to Bohr’s correspondence principle.’
As we will discuss in Chap. 8, Bohr’s imaginative use of the correspondence principle led
to his theory of atomic structure and the origin of the periodic table. Bohr and Einstein held
quite different views about how the problems of atomic structure and quantum phenomena
should be addressed. By 1920, Bohr’s view was that the propagation of light is accurately
described by Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld, while the processes of the
emission and absorption of radiation are quantum phenomena bolted onto a mechanical
model of the atom. Einstein was critical of the insecure foundations of the old quantum
theory, taking the view that the emission, absorption and propagation of radiation are all
quantum processes. Despite these differing points of view, Einstein’s admiration for Bohr’s
insight and achievements was unstinting. Many years later, Einstein wrote:
‘That this insecure and contradictory foundation [of the quantum theory] was sufﬁcient
to enable a man of Bohr’s instinct and tact to discover the major laws of the spectral lines
and of the electron shells of atoms together with their signiﬁcance for chemistry appeared
to me like a miracle – and it appears to me as a miracle even today. This is the highest
form of musicality in the sphere of thought.’ (Einstein, 1949)

Understanding atomic spectra – additional
quantum numbers
7.1 Optical spectroscopy, multiplets and the splitting of
spectral lines
The achievements described in Chap. 6 represented a remarkable advance in the understand-
ing of quantum phenomena, but there remained major challenges which were ultimately to
undermine the successes of the old quantum theory. Continuing advances in spectroscopy
enabled high resolution spectra to be obtained and, with the ability to place the sources of
emission in strong electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the full complexity of atomic and molec-
ular spectra became apparent. Atomic spectra display regularities, for example, the series
spectra of elements such as sodium and calcium which could be described by the Rydberg
formula (Sect. 1.6). Some of the most prominent spectral features consisted, however, of
multiplets, meaning the splitting of a line into a number of separate lines with similar
wavelengths. Examples of multiplets are illustrated in Fig. 7.1, derived from observations
of the photosphere of the Sun from the Pic du Midi observatory.
The simplest lines are singlets, the example of the Hα line of the Balmer series of
hydrogen being shown in Fig. 7.1a. In fact, the line is a very narrow doublet, which
Sommerfeld attributed to the effects of special relativity upon the circular and elliptical
orbits of electrons of the same principal quantum number (Sect. 5.3). The splittings we are
interested in here are very much larger effects. The classic example of a doublet is the
splitting of the sodium D line into two bright components labelled D1 (589.592 nm) and
D2 (588.995 nm) (Fig. 7.1b). A number of lines are triplets, for example, the magnesium
triplet at 516.7 nm, 517.3 nm and 518.4 nm shown in Fig. 7.1c.
In addition to multiplets, individual lines are split into a number of components in the
presence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the Stark and Zeeman effects respectively. The
discovery and interpretation of the Zeeman effect has already been discussed in Sect. 4.1.
The simplest variant is the normal Zeeman effect, illustrated schematically in Fig. 7.2a.
Generally, however, the splittings are more complex. An important example is the splitting
of the sodium D1 and D2 lines, in which the longer wavelength D1 line is split into four
components with no central line, while the shorter wavelength D2 line is split into six
components, again with no central line (Fig. 7.2b). The Zeeman splitting of the triplet zinc
line is illustrated in Fig. 7.2c, showing that one of the lines displays the normal Zeeman
effect while the other two line splittings are similar to those of the sodium D lines. It was
to prove to be a major challenge to understand the origins of the splitting of spectral lines
by electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

7.2 The Stark effect
Following the discovery of the splitting of emission lines in magnetic ﬁelds by Zeeman in
1896, Woldemar Voigt predicted in 1901 that there should be an analogous effect if atoms
are subject to an electric ﬁeld (Voigt, 1901). He estimated theoretically the magnitude of
this effect for an elastically bound electron in an atom, but found the predicted splitting
to be too small to be measured experimentally. Despite this discouraging prediction, Stark
investigated the effect experimentally in 1913 using the emission of ‘canal rays’, the ions
which passed through the perforated cathode of a discharge tube in the opposite direction

to the electron beam (Fig. 7.3a) (Stark, 1913) – this apparatus was the precursor of the
mass spectrograph which was to be perfected by Francis Aston. In his laboratory at the
Technische Hochschule in Aachen, Stark discovered the splitting of the Balmer series of
hydrogen and the lines of helium into a number of components when the canal rays were
subjected to a strong electric ﬁeld. Almost contemporaneously, Antonino Lo Surdo at
Florence had detected a similar effect in his discharge tubes (Lo Surdo, 1913). Stark found
that, when viewed perpendicular to the direction of the electric ﬁeld, the Hα and Hβ lines
were split into ﬁve components, the central components being polarised perpendicular to
the direction of the ﬁeld – the outer components were polarised parallel to the ﬁeld. When
viewed along the electric ﬁeld direction, three unpolarised components were observed. The
separation of the lines was symmetrical about the central line and, to a ﬁrst approximation,
proportional to the electric ﬁeld strength. In subsequent experiments, Stark showed that
there was no further splitting of the Hα line, but Hβ was split into 13 components, Hγ
into 15 and Hδ in 17 components in both the transverse and longitudinal directions (Stark,
1914). In the case of helium, six components were observed: three with polarisation parallel
and three with polarisation perpendicular to the ﬁeld direction. More complex splittings of
the emission lines of helium and heavier elements were observed as greater electric ﬁeld
strengths became available (Fig. 7.3b).
In the same year, Warburg and Bohr realised that Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom
offered an explanation of the Stark effect (Warburg, 1913; Bohr, 1914). Suppose the electric
ﬁeld acts in the z-direction. Then, in addition to the electrostatic force of the nucleus,
f = Ze2/4πϵ0r2, there is a perturbing electrostatic force on the electron due to the ﬁeld
which does work −eEz, where z can be taken to be the distance from the nucleus in the
z-direction. The nucleus is assumed to be inﬁnitely heavy and so remains stationary. The
change of energy of the stationary state is found by averaging z over the orbit, so that
E ∼eEz. The effect of the perturbing ﬁeld clearly depends upon the orientation and
ellipticity of the orbit of the electron, but it is apparent that the result will be to remove the

degeneracy of the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms because of the differing ellipticities
of their orbits for a given principal quantum number (Fig. 5.2) – we recall that elliptical
orbits, with the same semi-major axis and with the nucleus in one focus, all have the same
total energy. Inspection of the orbits in Fig. 5.2 suggests that the actual splitting depends
upon the quantum numbers n and n′ and that z should be of the order a = ϵ0h2n2/πmee2Z,
the radius of a circular Bohr orbit with principal quantum number n. Hence, the change in
energy En of the nth energy level is expected to be of the order
En ∼ϵ0h2E
πmeZe n2 .
(7.1)
Bohr’s estimates of the magnitude of En provided a good account of the Stark effect in
hydrogen, but he understood that a complete solution would require the determination of
the perturbed orbit of the electron in the atom in the presence of a uniform electric ﬁeld.
The solution was provided almost simultaneously by Paul Epstein1 (1916a) and Karl
Schwarzschild2 (1916). They used the action–angle variables introduced in Sects. 5.4.4
and 5.5 and followed the procedures developed by Delaunay (1860) in his studies of
the perturbing effects of distant planets upon the dynamics of the Earth–Moon system.
Sommerfeld (1919) provides an elegant description of these calculations.
These authors began with the more general problem of the motion of an electron, or
satellite, in the ﬁeld of two centres of attraction. The astrophysicists had shown that the
problem can be reduced to Hamilton–Jacobi form in which the coordinate system consists
of a family of confocal ellipses and hyperbolae with the two planets as centres of attraction
in each focus. If one of the centres of attraction is then taken to inﬁnity while the force of
attraction at the other is kept constant, the result is the same as a uniform ﬁeld at the other
centre of attraction. In this limiting case, the system of coordinates becomes a set of confocal
parabolae parameterised by coordinates ξ and η as illustrated in Fig. 7.4a. To complete the
three-dimensional coordinate system, the angle ψ is taken to be the polar angle with respect

to (ξ, η) coordinates are:

ξ 2 + 2x = ξ 2 ,

η2 −2x = η2 .
(7.2)
We now follow the procedures for ﬁnding the orbit of the electron in (ξ, η, ψ) coordinates
according to the Hamilton–Jacobi prescription of Sect. 5.5. The total energy Etot of the
electron, or its Hamiltonian H, is found to be

The equations for the velocities and momenta in (ξ, η, ψ) coordinates are given by Hamil-
ton’s equations (5.69), which become

(7.5)
The importance of working in parabolic coordinates is that the Hamiltonian (7.3) is sep-
arable and furthermore, from the last equation of (7.5), the pψ momentum is a constant,
corresponding to the conservation of angular momentum. The details of the calculations to
ﬁnd the expressions for pξ and pη are given by Sommerfeld (1919). The result is a system
of conditionally periodic orbits similar to those illustrated in Fig. 5.4, but now in parabolic
coordinates (Fig. 7.4b). Again the orbits just touch the bounding quadrangle formed by the
parabolae ξmax, ξmin and ηmax and ηmin. The orbits would eventually pass through every
point within the bounding quadrangle.
The next step is to apply the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantisation conditions (5.117)–(119) in
the (ξ, η, ψ) coordinate system,
#
pξ dξ = n1h ,
#
pη dη = n2h ,

(7.6)
where n1, n2 and n3 are positive integers. n1 and n2 are referred to as parabolic quantum
numbers while n3 is known as the equatorial quantum number. Carrying out the calculations
for the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms to ﬁrst order in the electric ﬁeld E, Epstein
and Schwarzschild found the result

We recognise immediately that the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (7.7) is the same as
the expression (5.120) for the energy levels of the Bohr–Sommerfeld atom. In addition, the
quantisation conditions applied to these orbits in the presence of the electric ﬁeld results in
a splitting of each energy level, as given by the second term on the right-hand side of (7.7).
The term is of the same form as that derived from our order of magnitude calculation (7.1),
but now the dependence of the splitting of the energy levels on the quantum numbers n1, n2

and n3 have been determined. The frequency splittings associated with transitions between
an initial stationary state (m1, m2, m3) and a ﬁnal state (n1, n2, n3) is
ν =
3hϵ0E
2πmeZ|e|[(m1 −m2)(m1 + m2 + m3) −(n1 −n2)(n1 + n2 + n3)] .
(7.8)
Finally, Sommerfeld’s selection rules for radiative transitions between stationary states
could be applied to determine the predicted splittings of the lines of the Balmer series in
hydrogen. Epstein found that these rules provided a complete description of Stark’s data on
the splittings of the lines of the Balmer series, as well as showing empirically that even-
numbered differences in m3 −n3 give rise to polarisation in the direction of the external
ﬁeld, while odd-numbered differences give rise to polarisation perpendicular to the electric
ﬁeld. These calculations were of the greatest importance for promoting the case for the old
quantum theory. In particular, as seen from (7.8), the splitting of the Balmer lines in the
Stark effect depends upon Planck’s constant h, in contrast to Lorentz’ explanation of the
normal Zeeman effect which does not depend upon h. The argument provides independent
support for Bohr’s postulate of the central importance of quantisation effects on the atomic
scale. As Epstein (1916b) remarked
‘We believe that the reported results prove the correctness of Bohr’s atomic model with
such striking evidence that even our conservative colleagues cannot deny its cogency.
It seems that the potentialities of quantum theory as applied to this model are almost
miraculous and far from being exhausted.’
Sommerfeld was equally effusive:
‘All in all, we may regard the theory of the Stark effect as one of the most striking
achievements of the quantum theory in atomic physics.’ (Sommerfeld, 1919)
7.3 The Zeeman effect
In the mid-1890s, Lorentz and Larmor had accounted for Zeeman’s discovery of the broad-
ening and splitting of spectral lines in the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds by the action of
the magnetic ﬁeld upon the oscillating or gyrating ‘ions’ in atoms (Sect. 4.1). The splitting
of the line consisted of three components, a central line plus two lines, equally spaced on
either side of it with displacements
ω0 = ± eB
2me
or
ν0 = ± eB
4πme
.
(7.9)
This splitting was referred to as the normal Zeeman effect. Zeeman was fortunate in that he
only observed broadening of the D lines of sodium, whereas he detected the characteristic
triple splitting of the spectral lines of cadmium and zinc, which are singlet lines and display
the normal Zeeman effect. When Preston carried out his experiments on the Zeeman effect
in sodium using the powerful electromagnet at the Royal College of Science in Dublin, he
found something quite different (Preston, 1898). In his words,

7.3 The Zeeman effect
‘It is interesting to notice that the two lines of sodium and the blue line 4800 ( ˚A) of
cadmium do not belong to the class which show as triplets. In fact, the blue cadmium line
belongs to the weak-middled quartet class, while one of the D lines (D2) shows as a sextet
of ﬁne bright lines. . . . the other D line (D1) shows as a quartet . . . ’
These splittings of the D-lines were conﬁrmed by Cornu (1898), the D1 line being a
quadruplet and the D2 line a sextuplet (Fig. 7.2b). These phenomena were referred to as the
anomalous Zeeman effect.
Following the development of the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantum model of the atom, the
challenge to theorists was to apply these concepts to the description of the Zeeman effect,
in the hope that this would cast light upon the anomalous Zeeman effect. This was taken
up by Debye (1916) and Sommerfeld (1916b) who used the formalism of action–angle
variables which proved to be ideally matched to the requirements of quantum theory. The
motion of the electron was determined by the combined inﬂuences of the electrostatic ﬁeld
of the nucleus and the Lorentz force f = e(v × B) associated with the magnetic ﬁeld B.
If the magnetic ﬁeld is homogeneous and uniform along the z-direction, the equations of
motion are (see also (4.2)–(4.4)):
me ¨x = eB ˙y −∂V
∂x ,
(7.10)
me ¨y = −eB ˙x −∂V
∂y ,
(7.11)
me¨z = −∂V
∂z ,
(7.12)
where we have written B = |B| and V = −Ze2/4πϵ0r. To convert these equations into a
form suitable for the application of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations, we need the Hamiltonian
for the system. Because of the v × B term, no work is done by the magnetic ﬁeld on the
electron and so the total energy of the system is

2me˙z2 + V =

(7.13)
To convert this into a Hamiltonian, we need to replace the electron’s three-momentum by
its conjugate momenta which is pi = me ˙xi + eAi, where Ai is one of the three components
of the vector potential A, deﬁned by B = curl A and i = 1, 2, 3 (see Sect. 5.4.3). For a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the z-direction,

m1, m2 and m3 and includes the effects of the magnetic ﬁeld on the energy of the orbits.
We recognise that m3 is the azimuthal quantum number nφ introduced in Sect. 6.4 and,
following the considerations of Sect. 6.5, the selection rule for m3 is the same as (6.55),

7.4 The anomalous Zeeman effect
namely
m3 = +1 ,
m3 = −1 ,
m3 = 0 .
(7.25)
These splittings correspond exactly to the normal Zeeman effect and the polarisation
properties are identical to those described in Sect. 6.5, namely the central line m3 = 0 is
linearly polarised and the m3 = ±1 components are circularly polarised. It can also be
observed that the Zeeman splitting term in (7.24) does not contain Planck’s constant and so
is an entirely classical term. Sommerfeld was well aware of the fact that, despite the more
sophisticated tools used, the analysis provided no more than the classical results derived by
Lorentz and Larmor. As expressed by Sommerfeld
‘In the present state the quantum treatment of the Zeeman effect achieves just as much as
Lorentz’s theory, but not more. It can account for the normal triplet . . . but hitherto it has
not been able to explain the complicated Zeeman types.’
Sommerfeld went on to consider the relativistic case, but this did not provide any further
insights (Sommerfeld, 1916b).
Sommerfeld labelled m3 the magnetic quantum number because of its appearance in
(7.23) in the guise of ω = eB/2me where me is the mass of the electron – m3 reappears in
the full theory of quantum mechanics as the quantum number m. The quantum number m3
corresponds to the projection of the total angular momentum vector, characterised by the
quantum number k, onto the magnetic ﬁeld direction and hence the energy term associated
with the magnetic ﬁeld can also be written
m3hω

cos α ,
(7.26)
where |L| = kh/2π is the magnitude of the total angular momentum and α is the angle
between the magnetic ﬁeld direction and the total angular momentum vector L. Introducing
the magnetic moment of the electron μ = (e/2me) L in its orbit about the nucleus, this
energy can be written μ · B, the interaction energy between a magnetic dipole and a
magnetic ﬁeld. If we consider the magnetic moment of an electron in the lowest energy
Bohr orbit, k = 1, we ﬁnd that |μ| = (e/2me)(h/2π) = eh/4πme. Pauli introduced the
term Bohr magneton to refer to this natural unit of magnetic moment which is written
μB = eh/4πme = e¯h/2me.
7.4 The anomalous Zeeman effect
While the Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the atom could account for the normal Zeeman
effect, it could not account for the much more complex splittings observed in the anomalous
Zeeman effect. The origin of the multiplicities of spectral lines was clearly related to the
anomalous Zeeman effect since singlet lines displayed the normal Zeeman effect while the
higher multiplets all exhibited anomalous Zeeman effects. Although the Bohr–Sommerfeld
model could account for the properties of hydrogen-like atoms, multiple electron systems

Understanding atomic spectra
proved to be intractable – models for helium with two electrons and a nucleus with two
opposite electric charges could not be reconciled with the experimental results. Sommerfeld
realised that, with the analyses of Zeeman splitting discussed in Sect. 7.3, he had gone as far
as he could with the standard procedures of action–angle variables and a different approach
would be required. His efforts were devoted to ﬁnding empirical relations which would give
insight into the origin of the anomalous Zeeman effect.
The Rydberg series of elements such as sodium and calcium could be accounted for in
terms of a modiﬁed variant of the Bohr–Sommerfeld model in which the shielding of the
nuclear charge by the orbiting electrons was included in the expression for the electrostatic
potential, as was demonstrated in Sect. 6.6. This modiﬁed model could also account for
the multiplicities of spectral lines – just as in the Stark effect the degeneracy associated
with the Balmer series was lifted by an applied electric ﬁeld, so the internal electric ﬁeld
associated with the multiple electron systems could lead to the lifting of the degeneracy
of the energy levels and change their energies. We recall that the degeneracy of the states
of hydrogen-like atoms is associated with the assumption of the pure inverse-square law
electrostatic potential of the nucleus – the presence of additional electrons results in a
non-inverse-square law of attraction close to the nucleus.
These considerations led to a natural ordering of the various series in terms of the mag-
nitudes of the quantum defects described by the quantities s, p and d in (1.19), (1.20) and
(1.21). Sommerfeld had shown that the properties of the ellipses could be characterised
by the two quantum numbers n, which determined the energy of the stationary state and k
which determined the total angular momentum of the orbit (Sect. 5.5). The emission lines
were assumed to be associated with the ‘valance electrons’, the outermost electrons of the
atoms. Thus, the Rydberg terms with the smallest quantum defects could be associated with
valance electrons which had circular orbits and so experienced the fully shielded nuclear
charge whereas the ‘penetrating’ orbits with large eccentricities would be expected to have
the greatest quantum defects. The quantum defects of the different series increase in the or-
der s, p, d, f , . . . Therefore, it was argued that the series with the greatest quantum defects
should have the most ‘penetrating’ orbits, corresponding to the maximum eccentricity for a
given principal quantum number, that is, k = 1. On the other hand, those with the smallest
quantum defects should be associated with circular orbits for which n = k. This led to
the association of the quantum numbers k = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . with the terms s, p, d, f , . . . ,
corresponding to the designations associated with the sharp, principal, diffuse and funda-
mental series.
The issue arose whether or not the quantum numbers n and k, together with the selection
rules for k, were sufﬁcient to account for all the features observed in atomic spectra.
The introduction of the magnetic quantum number showed that this feature had to be
accommodated in the rules. Sommerfeld was also concerned by the fact that some transitions
which would have been permitted according to Ritz’s combination principle were not in fact
observed (Sommerfeld, 1920a). This suggested that some other selection principle was at
work, associated with an additional inner quantum number, which at Bohr’s suggestion, he
named j. Thus, each state would be characterised by three quantum number n, k and j. For
example, for a state with n = 5, k = 1 and j = 3, Sommerfeld introduced the notation 5s3,
since k = 1 characterised the s states. From his analyses of the doublets and triplets of the

diffuse series, Sommerfeld was able to assign numerical values of j such that the selection
rule for j became j = ±1 or 0. Alfred Land´e took the analysis further and showed that
the transition j = 0 to j = 0 also had to be excluded. Sommerfeld was well aware of the
fact that these were empirical rules without any underpinning theoretical justiﬁcation.
To give more physical signiﬁcance to the introduction of this additional quantum number,
Sommerfeld and Land´e developed their magnetic core hypothesis according to which the
atomic core, consisting of the nucleus and the inner, non-valence, electrons, was attributed
an angular momentum sh/2π, where s took values 1, 2, . . . Associated with s was the
corresponding magnetic moment μ = (e/2me) L which was to be aligned with the angular
momentum vector of the core (Sommerfeld, 1923, 1924; Land´e, 1921a,b, 1923a,c). This
may be thought of as an ‘inner Zeeman effect’, the angular momentum being subject to the
rules of quantisation and so the vector could only take speciﬁc quantised orientations with
respect to any given axis. Such a hypothesis had already been introduced by Roschdest-
wensky in connection with the doublet separation of the ﬁrst line of the principal series of
lithium (Roschdestwensky, 1920).
Let us return to some of the early results which stimulated Land´e’s interest in the
anomalous Zeeman effect. Gradually the patterns of Zeeman splittings began to show
signiﬁcant regularities. In 1898, Preston formulated his law that
‘All the lines of a given series of a substance exhibit the same pattern of components in
a magnetic ﬁeld; moreover, analogous spectral lines of the same series, even if belonging
to different elements have the same Zeeman effect.’ (Preston, 1898)
By ‘series’ is meant columns in the periodic table containing similar elements, such as
the sequence of the alkaline metals sodium, potassium, rubidium (Group 1) or the alkaline
earth metals magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium (Group 2). This was followed by the
rule discovered by Runge and Paschen (1900) to the effect that,
‘the frequency differences for lines of the same type (multiplicity) turned out to be the
same.’
Of particular interest for interpreting the nature of the anomalous Zeeman effect was
Runge’s analysis of 1907 in which he provided a remarkably simple expression for the
frequency, or wavelength, dependence of the splittings of the spectral lines (Runge, 1908).
The normal Zeeman effect could be written
a = ν0 = λ0
λ2
0
=
eB
4πme
.
(7.27)
In Runge’s words,
‘The hitherto observed complex splittings of spectral lines in a magnetic ﬁeld exhibit
the following peculiarity: the distances of the components from the centre are integral
multiples of just a fraction of the normal separation a . . . So far, the fractions a/2, a/3,
a/4, a/6, a/7, a/11 and a/12 have been deﬁnitely observed. That is, . . . δν the frequency
difference(s) were integral multiples of the quantity a/r, where . . . the denominator r is
an integer between 1 (for the normal Zeeman effect) and 12.’
The quantity r became known as the Runge denominator.

Understanding atomic spectra
Exceptions to the rules concerning the appearance of the anomalous Zeeman effect
were discovered by Voigt and Hansen in helium and lithium (Voigt and Hansen, 1912).
Particularly in the case of lithium, it had been expected that the lines would display the
same anomalous Zeeman effect as observed in sodium and potassium, but instead the normal
Zeeman effect was observed. As stronger magnetic ﬁelds became available, Paschen and
Back found that at large enough magnetic ﬂux densities, the anomalous Zeeman effect was
replaced by the normal effect (Paschen and Back, 1912). Thus, in the case of the oxygen
triplet, for example, below 0.6 T, the three lines separated into the standard anomalous
Zeeman effect. At 0.6 T, however, the effect of the strong magnetic ﬁeld was that the
different natural line components overlapped and, at greater magnetic ﬂux densities, a
transformation began to take place until at magnetic ﬂux densities of 4 T, the pattern of
line splittings reverted to the normal Zeeman effect with the standard three lines. This
Paschen–Back effect could account for all the exceptions to Preston’s law.
Sommerfeld appreciated that the interpretation of the anomalous Zeeman effect had
the potential to unlock further insights into quantum physics. His concept was to give
further physical meaning to the empirical rules associated with the anomalous Zeeman
effect. In 1919, he introduced his decomposition rule starting from an analysis of the Runge
denominators (Sommerfeld, 1920b). Sommerfeld began with Runge’s rule written in the
form νan = qa/r, where q, the integral numerator, took values 0, ±1, ±2, . . . and the
characteristic values of r were 1, 2 and 3 for singlet, doublet and triplet lines respectively.
According to the precepts of quantum theory, the lines had to originate between stationary
states of the atoms in the magnetic ﬁeld which had energy displacements with respect to
the unperturbed states W1 and W2, so that
νan = ν1 −ν2 = W1 −W2
h
.
(7.28)
To obtain Runge’s rule, the frequency shifts νi also had to satisfy the rule and so
νi = qia
ri
,
where i = 1, 2 ,
(7.29)
where q1 and ri are the Runge numerators and denominators associated with the individual
energy states. Hence, from (7.28) Runge’s rule could be written in the following form
νan = qa
r
=
q1a
r1
−q2a
r2

= a q1r2 −q2r1
r1r2
.
(7.30)
Now, Sommerfeld associated the Runge denominators with the properties of the energy
levels themselves and not just the transitions. In his words,
‘We denote the equation, r = r1r2, as the magneto-optical decomposition rule and the
Runge number observed in the anomalous Zeeman effect can be decomposed into Runge
numbers of the ﬁrst and second terms involved in the spectral lines.’ (Sommerfeld, 1920b)
This was the beginning of a complex story of the development of empirical rules to
describe the many features of the anomalous Zeeman effect.3 The principal contributors
to these developments were Land´e, Sommerfeld and the young Werner Heisenberg. Land´e
rapidly became the authority on the anomalous Zeeman effect, particularly after he joined

Paschen’s group at T¨ubingen in 1922 as an extraordinary (associate) professor of theoretical
physics. At that time, T¨ubingen was the leading centre for experimental studies of the
anomalous Zeeman effect and Paschen needed Land´e’s theoretical expertise to make sense
of the experimental results.
In 1919, Land´e introduced the vector model of the atom to represent the addition of
angular momenta by analogy with their vectorial representation in classical mechanics
(Land´e, 1919). He represented the angular momentum of the core by the vector R which
was to be combined vectorially with the angular momentum K of the electron responsible
for the optical emission to form a resultant vector J which represented the total angular
momentum of the atom (Fig. 7.5). As in classical mechanics, the separate R and K vectors
were assumed to precess about the resultant angular momentum vector J. In the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld, J itself would precess about the magnetic ﬁeld direction. R and K had
to be combined according to the rules of quantisation and so would combine at different
angles, resulting in a variety of different stationary states with different total energies. As a
result of the magnetic interaction between the magnetic moments of the core and the outer
electron, the energy levels were different and Land´e attributed the different energies of the
multiplets to this interaction.
Both Sommerfeld and Land´e developed sets of empirical rules to describe the anomalous
Zeeman effect. The vector model of the atom with integral quantum numbers ran into the
difﬁculty that the singlet states would be associated with a core quantum number s = 1
which implied that the orbital quantum number l = 0, which was contrary to the assignment
of k = 1 according to the standard Bohr–Sommerfeld model. A different assignment of
quantum numbers was proposed by Land´e (1921a; 1922) which was widely adopted. In
it, half-integral quantum numbers were introduced with the following assignments: R =
1/2, 2/2, 3/2, . . . for singlet, doublet, triplet, . . . systems and K = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, . . . for
the s, p, d, . . . states with J half-integral for odd multiplicities and integral for even
multiplicities as the quantum number associated with the sum of the R and K vectors. In

this scheme, R = s + 1
2 and K = l + 1
2. The objective of these schemes was to account
simultaneously for the numbers of splittings of the lines, their polarisation properties and
their separation from the lines in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld.
To account for the spacing of the lines in the anomalous Zeeman effect, Land´e worked
by analogy with the normal Zeeman effect in which the energy levels were given by (7.23)
En = m3hν0, where ν0 is the gyrofrequency. m3 is the magnetic quantum number which
we showed was the same as the azimuthal quantum number in the Bohr–Sommerfeld model
of the atom. Land´e then wrote the splitting of the lines in terms of the quantum number m
with a splitting factor g which determined the actual splitting in terms of combinations of
the vectors R, K and J so that E = gmhν0. Empirically, he found the formula
g = 1 + J 2 −1
4 + R2 −K 2
2(J 2 −1
4)
= 1 + J 2 + R 2 −K 2
2J 2
,
(7.31)
where
J =

(J + 1

2) ,
R =
%
(R + 1
2)(R −1
2)
and
K =
%
(K + 1
2)(K −1
2) .
(7.32)
This formula closely resembles the modern expression for the Land´e g-factor.
In order to give more physical content to the theory, Land´e next reverted to the vector
model of the atom, but now using J, R and K in place of J, R and K. From the geometry
of Fig. 7.5, the cosine rule can be used to ﬁnd the angle between the vectors J and R and
then
g = 1 + R cos(J, R)
J
.
(7.33)
If H is the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, then the quantisation of the angular momentum
vector associated with J is given by the magnetic quantum number m such that m =
J cos(J, H) and so
mg = J cos(J, H) + R cos(J, R) cos(J, H) .
(7.34)
Now the product of the two cosines in the last term of (7.34) is just the average value of
cos(R, H) and so the value of mg can be written
mg = K cos(K, H) + 2R cos(R, H) .
(7.35)
This is a rather dramatic result since it might have been expected that, if the angular
momentum vectors had been added together, then their projections on the magnetic ﬁeld
direction would have resulted in
mg = K cos(K, H) + R cos(R, H) ,
(7.36)
in other words, the second term associated with the magnetic core contributed twice what
might have been expected according to Larmor’s formula for the precession of the vector
about the magnetic ﬁeld direction. Land´e made the suggestion that there might be an
anomalous magnetic moment associated with the core such that the ratio of the angular
momentum to magnetic moment was only half of the Larmor value, that is, an anomalous

gyromagnetic ratio. Remarkably, there was independent experimental evidence for the
anomalous gyromagnetic ratio from the experiments of Einstein and de Haas and conﬁrmed
by the careful experiments by Beck, as discussed in the next section.
Land´e’s achievement was quite remarkable, but there remained a lot to be explained,
in particular, what was the signiﬁcance of the introduction of J = [(J + 1
2)(J −1
2)]1/2?
Sommerfeld used a slightly different notation for J such that J = j + 1
2 and so the quantity
J is
J =
0
j( j + 1) .
(7.37)
To the modern reader, this has a familiar ring but in 1924 its signiﬁcance was obscure.
Land´e’s achievement was to infer these new features of quantum physics from analysis of
the anomalous Zeeman effect, before the invention of quantum mechanics.
7.5 The Barnett, Einstein–de Haas and Stern–Gerlach experiments
7.5.1 The anomalous gyromagnetic ratio
The value of the gyromagnetic ratio for atoms had been the subject of various experi-
ments which originated in attempts to understand the phenomenon of the magnetisation
of materials in terms of the magnetic moment per unit volume associated with what were
termed ‘Amp`erian currents’. To recapitulate the argument, an electron in a circular orbit
corresponds to a circular current I = eν, where ν is the frequency of rotation of the electron
about the nucleus. If the area of the orbit is A = πr2, the magnetic moment of the electron
is μ = I A = eν A. The angular momentum of the electron is L = mevr, and so, since
ν = v/2πr, the gyromagnetic ratio is deﬁned to be
L
μ = 2me
e
.
(7.38)
The same result is obtained for the bulk properties of a material if the orbits are aligned.
Therefore, there should be a relation between the magnetisation of a material and its angular
momentum. In macroscopic terms,
|L|
|μ| = 2me
e
= 1.13 × 10−10
in SI units .
(7.39)
Samuel Jackson Barnett realised that it would be possible to measure such an effect using
a cylinder of iron which initially is at rest with zero magnetisation. Then, if the cylinder
acquires angular momentum about its long axis, it should become magnetised. After a long
series of careful experiments carried out at the Physical Laboratory at Ohio State University,
he eventually found a positive effect and measured its magnitude, what became known as
the Barnett effect (Barnett, 1915).
A similar experiment was proposed by Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas who
looked for an ‘AC’ effect by switching the direction of magnetisation of the cylinder at the

frequency of the torsion ﬁlament which was used to suspend the cylinder (Einstein and de
Haas, 1915). They found the expected value given by (7.39) with an accuracy of about 10%,
but this was about a factor of 2 greater than that found by Barnett. Over the next few years,
these tricky experiments were repeated by Emil Beck, Gustav Arvidsson and the Barnetts
with the result that the gyromagnetic ratio converged on a value half of that given by (7.39)
(Beck, 1919a,b; Arvidsson, 1920; Barnett and Barnett, 1922). This phenomenon became
known as the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio.
7.5.2 Space quantisation and the Stern–Gerlach experiment
The possibility of demonstrating experimentally spatial quantisation as predicted by Som-
merfeld’s analysis of the Stark effect was taken up by Otto Stern at the University of
Frankfurt, despite the scepticism of the theorists who viewed quantisation as simply a for-
mal set of procedures. In 1920, Stern used the method of atomic beams to measure the
mean velocity of neutral silver atoms and found indeed that the experimental value agreed
with the expectations of Maxwell’s kinetic theory (Stern, 1920). He also planned to mea-
sure the velocity dispersion of the atoms, but this would have required many reﬁnements
of the experimental set-up. Instead, he turned to the issue of measuring space quantisation
experimentally. He was joined at Frankfurt by Walther Gerlach, a gifted experimenter, to
attempt the much more difﬁcult task of demonstrating the splitting of spectral lines in a
strong magnetic ﬁeld gradient. It is a straightforward calculation to show that, although
there is no net force on a magnetic dipole in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, there is a net force
if the magnetic ﬁeld is inhomogeneous. The net force on the dipole is
F = (m · ∇)B = |m| cos θ ∂Bz
∂z ,
(7.40)
where in the last expression it is assumed that the magnetic ﬁeld gradient is in the z-direction
and θ is the angle between the axis of the dipole and the magnetic ﬁeld direction, in this
case the z-direction. Classically, the magnetic moment could take any angle with respect
to the magnetic ﬁeld direction and so it would be expected that there would be a random
distribution of deﬂection angles. If, however, space quantisation is a real physical phe-
nomenon, the deﬂections would only take place at speciﬁc deﬂection angles θ. According
to the Bohr–Sommerfeld model, an electron in orbit within an atom would have azimuthal
angular momentum pφ = h/2π and would assume only three orientations with respect to
the magnetic ﬁeld direction given by
cos θ = n1
nφ
= 0, ±1 .
(7.41)
Bohr had argued in 1918 that the case n1 = 0 would be unstable because then the plane of
the orbit of the electron would lie in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld and this he argued was
an unstable conﬁguration (Bohr, 1918b). Therefore, it was expected that the beam would
only be split into two components corresponding to cos θ = ±1. Equally, the magnetic-core
theory of ﬁne-structure splitting by Sommerfeld and Land´e predicted a splitting of the s-
states of atoms into only two ﬁne-structure lines with no central component, corresponding
to s = ± 1

where the ﬁeld gradient is measured in gauss per centimetre, the temperature in kelvin and

deﬂection of silver atoms at a temperature of 1000 ◦C (1273 K) only amounted to about
10−2 mm. By obtaining the support of various companies for a powerful electromagnet,
for cryogens and vacuum pumps, they worked ceaselessly from the summer of 1921 to
March 1922 on the experiment. Stern moved to the University of Rostock at the beginning
of January 1922 and Gerlach carried on the experiments himself. In their original set-up,
the narrow beam of silver atoms, which was produced by heating a platinum strip coated
with silver to a temperature just above the boiling point of silver at 960 ◦C, was collimated
by small circular holes (Fig. 7.6b), but Gerlach hit upon the idea that it would be better
to replace the second hole with a narrow slit and so increase the intensity of the beam
and allow a ‘differential’ means of observing the splitting. By February 1922, Gerlach
observed the splitting of the beam of silver atoms into two separate beams. Following
further experiments, their paper was published in March 1922 (Gerlach and Stern, 1922a).
In it, they wrote
‘The atomic beam splits up into two distinct beams in a magnetic ﬁeld. No undeﬂected
atoms can be detected . . . In these results we see direct experimental proof of the direc-
tional [space-] quantisation in a magnetic ﬁeld.’

through which the beam of silver atoms passed and, during the Easter vacation, they went
on to show that the magnetic moment of the silver atoms in the ground state was one Bohr
magneton per gram-atom (Gerlach and Stern, 1922b). The importance of the result was not
lost on the physics community. As Paschen wrote to Gerlach,
‘Your experiment proves for the ﬁrst time the reality of Bohr’s stationary states.’ (Gerlach,
1969)
The Stern–Gerlach experiment is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of exper-
imental physics, but it raised many issues about the fundamentals of quantum physics.
Stern pointed out that, if space quantisation was a real physical effect, it should give rise
to birefringence, or double refraction, in materials since there would be a difference in the
refractive indices along and perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld direction (Stern, 1921).
Such an effect had never been observed. In addition, there were problems in understanding
how the alignment of the orbits could come about according to classical physics. Einstein
and Ehrenfest (1922) pointed out that the alignment of the magnetic moments of an initially
random angular distribution would not take place instantaneously. Classically, the align-
ment would involve the exchange of angular momentum between atoms and their estimate
of the time-scale for this process was 1011 seconds, far longer than the 10−4 seconds that it
took the beam of atoms to pass through the magnetic ﬁeld distribution of the magnets. It
was inferred that there was something seriously wrong with the mechanical and dynamical
laws at the atomic level. This was only the beginning of the difﬁculties with the old quantum
theory – much worse was about to follow.

Bohr’s model of the periodic table and
the origin of spin
8.1 Bohr’s first model of the periodic table
We now need to retrace our steps and follow Bohr’s activities from his great Trilogy of 1913
to his model for the periodic table of 1922. In 1914, Bohr petitioned the Danish government
to create a professorship for him in theoretical physics and this was granted two years later.
In the meantime, he returned to Manchester as Schuster Reader in physics before taking up
his appointment as Professor of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen in 1916. In 1917, Bohr
successfully petitioned the physics faculty of Copenhagen University to found an Institute
for Theoretical Physics with Bohr as its founding director. The Institute was ofﬁcially opened
in 1921, but the strain of setting up the new institute combined with his continuing, almost
obsessive, research programme into the fundamentals of quantum theory, took a heavy toll
and in 1921 he suffered a serious bout of ill-health. Despite this, he remained the driving
force behind the attack on the problems of quantum theory on a very broad front. Thanks
to his tireless efforts and inspiration, Copenhagen became one of the two major centres
for the development of quantum theory, the other being in G¨ottingen, through the 1920s
when the foundations of the old theory were to be cut away and replaced by completely
new concepts. The Institute for Theoretical Physics, commonly referred to as the ‘Bohr
Institute’, became formally the Niels Bohr Institute in 1965, three years after his death.1
Already in the second paper of the Trilogy of 1913, Bohr aspired to account not just for
the spectrum of hydrogen, but for the structure of all the atoms in the periodic table and
their chemical properties (Bohr, 1913b). He had convinced himself that radioactive decay
was associated with the nucleus of the Rutherford atom while the chemical properties were
associated with the system of electrons orbiting the nucleus. His ﬁrst efforts to deﬁne the
electronic structure of atoms in the periodic table are engagingly told by Heilbron (1977).
Heilbron summarises the four assumptions upon which Bohr made his ﬁrst tentative steps
into atomic structure: (i) all the electrons lie in circular orbits in the same plane through the
nucleus; (ii) the populations of the innermost quantised rings increase with atomic number;
(iii) each electron, no matter how far from the nucleus, has angular momentum h/2π in
its ground state; (iv) the ground state is characterised by that which results in the lowest
energy for the given total angular momentum. Bearing in mind the need to account for the
periodic structure of the periodic table, he came up with an assignment of the numbers of
electrons to different shells in atoms given in Table 8.1.
Unlike the more theoretically minded physicists, Bohr lay considerable store in under-
standing the chemical properties of the atoms, for example, their valences and the similarity
of the properties of the elements in the different columns of the periodic table. The stability

of the circular orbits with increasing numbers of electrons also played a role in his thinking,
following the hints provided by Nicholson’s analysis of the stability of rings of electrons
to oscillations perpendicular to the orbital planes of the electrons (see Sect. 4.4). Since
the electrons were all assumed to have circular orbits in the same plane, the outermost
‘valence’ ring was shielded from the nuclear charge by the inner completed shells. As a
result, the valence shells of similar elements such as the alkali metals, lithium, sodium and
potassium were given the same outer electron structure, as did the alkaline earth metals,
beryllium, magnesium, calcium. This model had little lasting appeal, but it is indicative of
Bohr’s adventurous spirit in attempting to encompass a wide range of quantum and atomic
phenomena in a single scheme in the context of his great innovations of 1913. The concept
of shells of electrons was introduced, although Bohr was well aware of the provisional
nature of his assignments of quantum numbers to the different elements. This was the be-
ginning of the attempts by many theorists to create models of atoms including the quantum
concepts introduced by Bohr. Notice that the electron orbits are entirely determined by a
single quantum number, the principal quantum number n. As a result, this model is often
referred to as a one-quantum structure.
Following this foray into atomic structure, Bohr lay aside this aspect of his researches.
As he wrote to Moseley in 1913, ‘For the present I have stopped speculating on atoms.’
Others including Ladenburg, Vegard, Langmuir and Bury proposed alternative schemes,
but none of these gained general acceptance by the community of scientists. Bohr was
profoundly impressed by Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr atom to elliptical orbits and
the explanation of the ﬁne-structure splitting of spectral lines as the effects of special
relativity upon the orbits, which were described in Chaps. 5 and 6. As Bohr wrote to
Sommerfeld in March 1916,
‘I thank you so much for your paper, which is so beautiful and interesting. I do not think
that I have ever read anything which has given me so much pleasure.’2
At the same time, the analyses of the Stark and Zeeman effects by Schwarzschild, Epstein,
Sommerfeld and Debye greatly advanced understanding of the nature of quantum effects
within atoms. Bohr had planned to write a comprehensive review of quantum phenomena
in 1916 in an attempt to present the theory in a logically consistent manner, but he delayed
publication in the light of these advances. In fact, he did not publish the results of his
deliberations until 1918 when his important papers under the title On the quantum theory
of line spectra surveyed all that was known about atomic spectra and also advocated

8.2 The Wolfskehl lectures
Ehrenfest’s adiabatic hypothesis (Sect. 5.6) as a guiding principle for the formulation of
quantum theory (Bohr, 1918a,b). These papers contained the ﬁrst formulation of Bohr’s
correspondence principle as well as the selection rules for permitted quantum transitions
(see Chap. 6).
For the next few years, Bohr was largely preoccupied with the construction of the Institute
of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen and he published relatively few papers, but in 1921
he was spurred into action by a letter to Nature by Norman R. Campbell which proposed
that the static models of atoms and molecules developed by Lewis and Langmuir were ‘not
really inconsistent’ with the Bohr–Sommerfeld model (Campbell, 1920). Bohr disagreed
profoundly with this statement and went much further in advocating a model of atomic
structure based strictly upon the quantum principles he had enunciated in his papers of
1918 and the correspondence principle. In his words,
‘Thus, by means of a closer examination of the progress of the binding process this
principle offers a simple argument for concluding that these electrons are arranged in
groups in a way which reﬂects the periods exhibited by the chemical properties of the
elements within a sequence of increasing numbers. In fact, if we consider the binding of a
large number of electrons by a nucleus of higher positive charge, this argument suggests
that after the ﬁrst two electrons are bound in one-quantum orbits, the next eight electrons
will be bound in two-quantum orbits, the next eighteen in three-quantum orbits, the next
thirty two in four-quantum orbits.’ (Bohr, 1921a)
This announcement generated a great deal of interest in the physics and chemistry com-
munity which was anxious to hear about Bohr’s apparent solution of the problem of under-
standing atomic structure and the nature of the periodic table of the elements. Bohr reﬁned
his proposals in a further letter to Nature later that year (Bohr, 1921b). The opportunity to
give a complete picture of his thinking about quantum physics and the theory of the periodic
table came in 1922 with the invitation to deliver the Wolfskehl lectures at G¨ottingen, which
were to have a lasting impact upon the development of quantum theory.
8.2 The Wolfskehl lectures and Bohr’s second
theory of the periodic table
The mathematician Paul Wolfskehl died in 1906 and bequeathed 100,000 Marks to the
K¨onigliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften of G¨ottingen as a prize for the ﬁrst person to
provide a complete proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem,3 the statement that there are no integers
x, y, z and n which satisfy the equation xn + yn = zn for x, y, z ̸= 0 and n > 2. Until the
prize was awarded, the interest on the bequest should be used by the G¨ottingen Academy to
advance the mathematical sciences. Under Hilbert’s direction, an annual series of lectures
was set up to attract distinguished scientists in the areas of mathematics and physics to
deliver a series of lectures on frontier topics in these disciplines. The ﬁrst set of lectures
was delivered by Poincar´e in 1909, subsequent lecturers including Lorentz, Sommerfeld,
Einstein, von Smoluchowski, Mie and Planck. The invitation to Bohr was sent in November

1920 and, once his health had recovered, he delivered his seven lectures during the period
12–22 June 1922. The lectures attracted a galaxy of those working on the key problems of
quantum physics from all over Germany, as well as Ehrenfest from Leiden and Klein and
Oseen from Bohr’s Institute in Copenhagen. Sommerfeld brought with him from Munich
the 20-year old Werner Heisenberg, while 22-year old Wolfgang Pauli came from Hamburg.
The audience totalled about 100 physicists and mathematicians. Bohr took the occasion
very seriously and used it to present his personal survey of the entire ﬁeld of quantum and
atomic physics. Soon, the event became known as the Bohr Festspiele, or ‘Bohr Festival’
and was to have a major inﬂuence on the future directions which those present took to the
study of quantum physics.
The contents of the lectures are described in the fourth volume of Bohr’s collected works
(Bohr, 1977). The ﬁrst three lectures on the 12, 13 and 14 June 1922 concerned: Lecture 1:
Review of the history of quanta and quantisation and the Bohr model of the atom of 1913;
Lecture 2: The Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the atom, Ehrenfest’s adiabatic hypothesis,
multiply periodic systems and the relativistic theory of electron orbits; Lecture 3: The
interpretation of spectra, the Zeeman and Stark effects, the correspondence principle, space
quantisation and the Stern–Gerlach experiment. These topics have been discussed in earlier
chapters. Lectures 4, 5, 6 and 7 were devoted to Bohr’s interpretation of the periodic table
in atomic terms. In this analysis, he used the form of the periodic table presented by his
compatriot, Julius Thomsen, shown in Fig. 8.1, in which the lines join elements with similar
chemical properties (Thomsen, 1895a,b). The important innovation of Thomsen’s scheme,

as compared with that of Mendeleyev (Fig. 1.2), was the identiﬁcation of the noble gases,
helium (2), neon (10), argon (18), krypton (36) and xenon (54) as elements of zero valence
which completed the various periods of the periodic table. As expressed by Thorpe in his
History of Chemistry, Vol. 2. From 1850 to 1910,
‘The valency of such an element would be zero, and therefore in this respect also it would
represent a transitional stage in the passage from the univalent electronegative elements
of the seventh to the univalent electropositive elements of the ﬁrst group.’ (Thorpe, 1910)
Lecture 4 was devoted to the ﬁrst period of the table, the atoms hydrogen and helium.

indicated by the principal quantum number n and the azimuthal quantum number k and
written nk. If there are x electrons in the state nk, the designation (nk)x is used. We recall
that, according to the Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the atom, the orbits are circular if k = n
and the orbits with the greatest eccentricity have k = 1 if k ̸= n. Helium proved to be much
more problematic and most of the lecture was devoted to describing these difﬁculties. The
theory had to account for the fact that two separate systems of lines appeared in the helium
spectrum, what were termed parahelium, which consisted of singlet lines, and orthohelium
which consisted to triplet lines (see Fig. 16.1). Bohr and Kramers had wrestled with the
problems of understanding the dynamics and stability of the helium atom and eventually
adopted a model consisting of two electrons in separate circular orbits about the doubly
charged nucleus. Their stability arguments led them to the conclusion that the electrons
could not occupy the same plane, but rather that the planes of the two orbits had to be
inclined to each other as illustrated in Fig. 8.2b. Note that the size of the helium atom is
smaller than the hydrogen atom because of its doubly charged nucleus. Unlike the case of
hydrogen in which the ionisation potential and the energy levels were precisely predicted
by the quantum theory, satisfactory agreement could not be achieved for the helium atom.
Undaunted, Bohr proceeded to the rest of the periodic table in Lecture 5 and 6. There were
two important inﬂuences on his thinking. The ﬁrst was what he called his Aufbauprinzip,
or ‘building-up principle’, in which the atomic structure of successive elements is obtained
by adding an electron to the pre-existing structure of the previous element in the periodic
table, noting at the same time that the charge on the nucleus increased, providing stronger
binding to the nucleus. The second concept was the use of penetrating orbits to account
for the valence electrons. The elliptical orbits of the Bohr–Sommerfeld model now came
into their own, particularly thanks to a foray into atomic structure by Arnold Schr¨odinger.
In his paper of 1921, he solved the problem of the dynamics of an electron in a quasi-
elliptical orbit which penetrates within the atomic core of the inner electrons (Fig. 8.3)
(Schr¨odinger, 1921). In the outer region, the electron experiences the electrostatic force
of a single electronic charge, while inside the circular inner orbit, it feels the full force
of the nucleus. The small ellipse embedded within the circular orbit shows the resulting
kinematics. In addition, Schr¨odinger was able to account for the Rydberg formula of the
alkali metals, the reasoning being similar to the arguments described in Sect. 6.6.

8.2 The Wolfskehl lectures
Bohr argued that the third electron in lithium could not be in a 11 orbit because it would
be too tightly bound to the nucleus. The solution was to place it in the next shell as a 21
elliptical orbit about the helium nucleus, as illustrated in Fig. 8.2c. Notice the distortions
of the ellipse close to the ‘helium core’ and the consequent precession of the elliptical
orbit about the nucleus. The 21 orbit of the electron is evidently less tightly bound to the
nucleus and becomes the valence electron of lithium. Bohr placed the next electron in a
21 orbit to create the beryllium atom with double valence. Proceeding beyond boron, Bohr
found himself in uncertain waters. The one ﬁxed point was that, by the time he reached the
next noble gas neon, the structure should be stable with what we would now call a ‘closed
shell’. He achieved this by ﬁlling up the n = 2 state with 21 and 22 orbits, placing four
electrons in each and so accounting for the atomic number A = 10. The structure he had
in mind is shown in Fig. 8.2d. The diagram is to be interpreted as four 21 orbits and four
22 orbits in three dimensions as explained by Kramers and Helge Holst in their popular
book (Kramers and Holst, 1923). Bohr’s dilemma is indicated in the published form of his
electron assignments in the periodic table of Table 8.2 in which boron is tentatively given
a 22 electron and the ﬁlling of the remaining electrons to the shell left uncertain.
With the n = 2 shell ﬁlled, Bohr immediately assigned the eleventh electron to a 31 orbit
which gave it a similar valence role to that of lithium (Fig. 8.2e) while the twelfth electron
was also assigned a 31 orbit corresponding to the magnesium atom. In ﬁlling up the rest
of the n = 3 shell, there were now elliptical 32 orbits available and Bohr proposed that the
completion of the n = 3 shell at argon should consist of four electrons with 31 orbits and
four with 32 orbits (Fig. 8.4a). The next step was to continue to the n = 4 shell and it was
straightforward to assign one 41 electron to potassium and a second 41 electron to calcium.
However, now he had to incorporate the elements from scandium to nickel. These elements
have similar chemical properties and this could be explained if the inner n = 3 shell was
completed, including the circular 33 orbits, rather than electrons being added to the n = 4
level. Bohr advanced arguments that, in ﬁlling up the n = 3 levels rather than proceeding
with the n = 4 levels, these atoms would be in a lower state of total energy. The building up
of the elements proceeded in this way, with closed shells at krypton (Fig. 8.4c) and xenon
(Fig. 8.4d). The rare earth elements from cerium (58) to ytterbium (70) were associated
with the completion of inner shells with the result that their chemical properties would be
very similar. In his Nobel lecture of 1922, Bohr went so far as to state that
‘Indeed, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that if the existence of the rare earths had
not been established by direct experimental investigation, the occurrence of a family of
elements of this character within the sixth period of the natural system of the elements
might have been theoretically predicted.’ (Bohr, 1922)
Bohr proceeded to assign electrons to periods up to n = 7, his sketch of the radium
atom, drawn at twice the scale of the earlier diagrams, showing clearly the ‘shell’ structure
of the electron distributions (Fig. 8.5). He even suggested that the unknown element with
A = 118 should be stable.
Bohr implied that his assignments of the electrons to different shells were based upon
detailed calculations, including application of the correspondence principle to atomic struc-
ture. In fact, it seems that the assignments were primarily based upon symmetry, the need

to account for the similarities of the chemical elements, his deep pondering about how the
quantum concepts associated with the Bohr–Sommerfeld model could be extended to the
complete periodic table, and intuition. Bohr’s closest collaborator, Hans Kramers, proba-
bly had a better understanding of Bohr’s meaning of the correspondence principle and its
applications than anyone. In his popular book with Holst, he emphasised the provisional
nature of the assignments of the electron distributions and of the arguments which led to
these (Kramers and Holst, 1923). As remarked by Kragh, no evidence has been found that
Bohr’s conclusions were based upon detailed mathematical calculations (Kragh, 1985).
Bohr’s assignments of electronic structures to the elements had a major success in
predicting the properties of the unknown element with atomic number A = 72. According
to his scheme, it should have properties similar to zirconium with A = 40 (see Table 8.2).
A spanner was thrown in the works with the claim that an element with A = 72 had been
discovered by the French scientists in a sample of rare earths which they interpreted as a

new element which they called celtium. They inferred that the element should belong to
the rare earth group of lanthanides, in conﬂict with Bohr’s assignment shown in Table 8.2.
Bohr eventually persuaded Coster to examine ores of zirconium and found that indeed the
element with A = 72 was present with high abundance in all such samples. The element
was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, Hafnia. Bohr announced this
discovery in his Nobel Prize lecture of 1922.4
Bohr’s lectures had a major impact, particularly upon the younger participants. Although
provisional, Bohr’s model for the periodic table was an attempt using plausible quantum
physics to put order into many different aspects of the periodic table of the chemical
elements. As remarked later by Pauli,
‘It made a strong impression upon me that Bohr at that time and in later discussions was
looking for a general explanation that should hold for the closing of every electron shell
and in which the number 2 was considered as essential as 8.’ (Pauli, 1964)
The Bohr model provided a framework for many different attacks upon the problems of the
quantum physics of atoms and molecules.
8.3 X-ray levels and Stoner’s revised periodic table
It is striking that Bohr had been able to achieve so much employing only two quantum
numbers, the principal quantum number n and the azimuthal quantum number k. There is

8.3 X-ray levels
no mention of the inner quantum number, j or J, introduced by Sommerfeld and Land´e
to account for the anomalous Zeeman effect. Most of Bohr’s attention had concentrated
upon the interpretation of optical data and the valencies of the chemical elements which
are associated with the outer electronic structures of atoms. In contrast, X-ray emission
lines and X-ray absorption edges provided direct information about the innermost shells of
atoms. Bohr discussed the importance of the X-ray measurements in his seventh and ﬁnal
Wolfskehl lecture, but no mention is made of the inner quantum number.
In Moseley’s pioneering X-ray experiments of 1913 and 1914, the K and L X-ray lines
were used to order the chemical elements according to their atomic numbers, as discussed
in Sect. 4.6 (Moseley, 1913, 1914). The interpretation of Moseley’s data in terms of the
Bohr model was taken up by Kossel (1914, 1916). He reasoned that, when an electron is
ejected from the innermost n = 1 stationary state of a Bohr atom, this vacancy is reﬁlled
by an electron jumping from a higher energy state, in the process emitting a photon with
energy equal to the difference in energies of the initial and ﬁnal states. It was thus expected
that there would be a series of lines associated with transitions originating from the n = 2,
n = 3, . . . states. This model accounted for the fact that the characteristic X-ray emission
lines were always observed in emission and not in absorption. In Kossel’s interpretation,
the K and L shells corresponded to ﬁnal states with principal quantum numbers n = 1
and 2. Although not stated explicitly, Kossel assumed that there is a maximum number of
electrons which could occupy each shell which becomes particularly stable when it is ﬁlled
with the maximum number of electrons.
X-ray spectroscopy techniques developed dramatically over the succeeding years,5 the
spectral resolution of the measurements increasing by a factor of at least 100. A review of
these early developments is presented by Manne Siegbahn (1962), one of the pioneers of
precision X-ray spectroscopy, in which he pointed out that the X-ray spectroscopists had
access to wavelengths in the range 0.1–20 ˚A, far exceeding the range available to optical
spectroscopists. The high spectral resolution enabled details of the various X-ray multiplets
to be studied in detail. The clustering of X-ray lines into K and L shells is illustrated by the
X-ray spectrum of silver shown in Fig. 8.6a. Although there is a great deal of ﬁne structure,
the separation into K and L shells is clear. In addition to these emission spectra, the X-rays
are absorbed by atoms, but rather than emission lines, absorption edges were observed, as
illustrated by the variation of the absorption coefﬁcient of X-rays by silver atoms (Fig. 8.6b).
The wavelengths of the absorption edges are shorter than those of the emission lines of
the same series. This was attributed to the fact that absorption of X-radiation from, say,
the K level requires the photons to have energy ε ≥EK, the ionisation energy from the K
shell.
It can be seen from Fig. 8.6b that the K series is a singlet, in that there is only a single
absorption edge, whereas the L series has three absorption edges. Proceeding to higher
levels for elements with greater atomic numbers, it was found that the M series had ﬁve
edges and N seven. These results found a natural interpretation as multiplets of the different
shells of the atoms. Whilst a given level had the same principal quantum number n, different
sublevels would be associated with the different allowed values of k. This interpretation
was, however, in conﬂict with Bohr’s assignments of the number of sublevels in the L shells
which were only deﬁned by the two quantum numbers n = 2 and k = 2 and 1. There are only
two possible combinations of these quantum numbers (n = 2, k = 2) and (n = 2, k = 1)

which would have different energies since the former is a circular orbit and the latter an
ellipse. This conﬂicted with the observation that the L state is a triplet and correspondingly
the M series is a quintuplet rather than a triplet. Evidently, an additional quantum number
was needed and this was provided by the inner quantum number J. Land´e proposed the
distribution of electrons among the K, L and M levels shown in Table 8.3. Accompanying
these assignments was a set of selection rules in which k would change by 1 and J by 1
or 0.

studies with Rutherford and Fowler at Cambridge, to make the next major advance in

deﬁning the electronic structures of atoms. He was well aware of the difﬁculties of the Bohr
scheme and favoured Land´e’s scheme. He noted in addition that there is a strong analogy
with the inferred structure of the atom based upon Land´e’s interpretation of the anomalous
Zeeman effect. The X-ray levels could be related to the optical terms inferred from the
analysis of optical spectra. The last line of Table 8.3 shows the corresponding optical terms
for the doublet terms of the alkali metals in Stoner’s notation. In his paper, Stoner (1924)
wrote:
‘The number of electrons in each completed level is equal to double the sum of the inner
quantum numbers as assigned, there being in the K, L, M, N levels, when completed,
2, 8 (= 2 + 2 + 4), 18 (= 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 6), . . . electrons. It is suggested that the num-
ber of electrons associated with each sub-level separately is also equal to double the inner
quantum number.’
Thus, according to Stoner’s arithmetic and referring to Table 8.3,
The K level contains 2 × 1 = 2 electrons;
The LI sublevel contains 2 × 1 = 2 electrons;
The LII sublevel contains 2 × 1 = 2 electrons;
The LIII sublevel contains 2 × 2 = 4 electrons.
In this way, Stoner built up the periodic table, Fig. 8.7 showing the distribution of electrons
for the closed shells of the inert gases. The sublevels of a given shell, indicated by roman
capital numerals, are characterised by the azimuthal quantum number k and the inner
quantum number J which takes values k and k −1. Therefore, in Stoner’s scheme, the
maximum occupancy of a k shell is 2 × [k + (k −1)] = 4k −2. For a given value of n,
this resulted in the ﬁlling of the sublevels with 2 (k = 1), 6 (k = 2), 10 (k = 3), 14 (k = 4),

18 (k = 5), . . . The number of electrons in a completely ﬁlled shell with principal quantum
number n is 2, 8, 18, 32, 50 . . . , in other words 2n2. The total numbers of electrons in a given
atom is indicated by all the numbers above and to the left of the heavy line drawn under
each atom’s symbol. As compared with Bohr’s scheme, there was a greater concentration
of electrons in the outer subgroups and the closure of the inner subgroups at earlier stages.
Stoner’s scheme was immediately adopted by Sommerfeld who remarked:
‘Being based on the incontestable experience as to the number and order of X-ray levels,
and on the association of quantum numbers with these, Stoner’s scheme is much more
trustworthy than Bohr’s. It has an arithmetic rather than geometric-mechanical character;
without assuming any symmetry of orbits it exploits not some, but all available data of
X-ray spectroscopy.’ (Sommerfeld, 1925)
In his memoirs, Stoner wrote:
‘Probably no other single paper of mine has attracted so much attention. . . . It is of interest
to note, however, that an explicit statement is effectively made of what later became known
as the Pauli exclusion principle, though it is presented more as having been arrived at
inductively from experimental ﬁndings rather than as a basic axiom for a deductive
treatment of electron distribution as in Pauli’s paper. . . . ’ (Bates, 1969)
8.4 Pauli’s exclusion principle
Stoner’s insights impressed Wolfgang Pauli, in particular his statement:
‘Twice the inner quantum number does give the observed term multiplicity as revealed by
the spectra in a weak magnetic ﬁeld . . . In other words, the number of possible states of the
(core plus electron) system is equal to twice the inner quantum number, these 2J states
being always possible and equally probable, but only manifesting themselves separately
in the presence of the external ﬁeld.’ (Stoner, 1924)
Pauli inferred that a natural explanation of the shell structure of the atom was to postulate
that the state of electrons in atoms is determined by four quantum numbers, n the principal
quantum number, k the azimuthal quantum number, J the inner quantum number and m, the
component of angular momentum in the direction of an applied ﬁeld, where −J ≤m ≤J,
provided only one electron is allowed to occupy each of these states. These rules enabled
Pauli to recover Stoner’s results described in the last section. But the implications were
much deeper and were to have profound implications for the future development of quantum
mechanics. Pauli had enunciated the principle of exclusion, according to which within an
atom not more than one electron can occupy a stationary state with a single set of quantum
numbers, the Pauli exclusion principle. In his words,
‘There never exist two or more equivalent electrons in an atom which, in strong magnetic
ﬁelds, agree in all quantum numbers n, k, J and m. If there exists in the atom an electron
for which these quantum numbers (in the external ﬁeld) have deﬁnite values, this state is
“occupied”.’ (Pauli, 1925)

8.5 The spin of the electron
Pauli was impressed by the fact that the exclusion principle could account for the absence
of certain states in, for example, the alkaline earth metals such as calcium, which would
involve two electrons with the same quantum numbers. The physical signiﬁcance of the
internal quantum number J and the origin of the exclusion principle itself were, however,
obscure. Pauli associated the quantum number J with the valance electron itself rather than
with the core and, in the limit of strong magnetic ﬁelds when the Paschen–Back effect
dominates, he showed that J behaves like orbital angular momentum. He referred to the
property of the quantum number J of the valance electron as ‘classically not-describable
two-valuedness’. He was very close to discovering the spin of the electron and its magnetic
moment, but drew back from that ﬁnal step.6
8.5 The spin of the electron
The discovery of the spin and magnetic moment of the electron by Samuel Goudsmit
and George Uhlenbeck has an amusing history. The concept of the spin of the electron
was ﬁrst explored by Ralph Kronig in 1925 while he held a travelling fellowship from
Columbia University. During his visit to T¨ubingen, then the centre of spectroscopic studies
of atoms and molecules, Land´e showed him a letter from Pauli describing his work on
the exclusion principle and the need for four quantum numbers. Kronig hit upon the idea
that the J quantum number was associated with the intrinsic spin of the electron. If the
orbits of the electrons resembled a planetary system, he reasoned that the electron itself
would be spinning, just like the planets. He then associated a magnetic moment of one Bohr
magneton with the spinning electron. This concept immediately suggested an origin for the
splitting of the D lines of sodium into D1 and D2 components. The electron experiences
a magnetic ﬁeld B because of its motion through the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus of
magnitude B = (1/c2)(v × E). Consequently, there is an interaction energy associated
with the magnetic moment of the electron and the induced magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude
μ · B. Because the J quantum number took up two orientations with respect to the magnetic
ﬁeld direction, their interaction energies were different and gave excellent agreement with
the observed splitting of the sodium D lines. Furthermore, this model was also in full
agreement with Land´e’s semi-empirical ‘relativistic splitting rule’.
There were however concerns. Kronig went on to apply the magnetic coupling argument to
hydrogen atoms and found an answer similar to that found by Sommerfeld in his relativistic
treatment of the hydrogen atom. The worry was that Sommerfeld’s model accounted very
well for the observed ﬁne-structure splitting of hydrogen and so there would have to be some
remarkable ﬁne tuning if the combination of effects were to result in the observed splitting.
In fact, Kronig was always a factor of 2 out in obtaining the required compensation. There
was another concern which was that the velocity of the surface of a classical electron would
be rotating at a speed far exceeding the speed of light. This can be demonstrated by a simple
classical calculation. The Stern–Gerlach experiment was interpreted as evidence that the
angular momentum of the valence electron is ¯h/2. Therefore, the speed of rotation of the
surface of the electron would be given by the relation mvr = ¯h/2. Using the expression

Bohr’s model of the periodic table
for the classical electron radius found by equating the rest mass energy of the electron
to its electrostatic potential energy r = e2/4πϵ0mec2, v = c/2α, where the ﬁne-structure
constant α = e2/2ϵ0h ≈1/137. Thus, the speed of rotation of the surface of the electron
would far exceed the speed of light. Kronig discussed these ideas with Pauli, Kramers and
Heisenberg who were strongly critical of the proposal, Pauli being particularly dismissive.
Kronig let the matter rest.
After the publication of Pauli’s paper on the exclusion principle, the idea was revived
by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit (1925a). They were impressed by two considerations. The
ﬁrst, pointed out to them by Ehrenfest, was the calculation by Abraham that if the charge
of a rotating sphere is distributed over its surface, the magnetic moment is twice that
if the charge is uniformly distributed through the sphere (Abraham, 1903). The second
was the fact that Pauli’s paper required four quantum numbers to describe the motion
of the electron. Since they equated the number of quantum numbers with the number
of degrees of freedom, they could associate three of these with the kinematics of the
motion of the electron, but what about the fourth? Their guess was that it was associated
with the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron, rather than with that of the core.
They were well aware that a consequence would be that the rotation speed of the surface
of the electron would far exceed the speed of light. Pauli’s ‘classically not-describable
two-valuedness’ was to be associated with two allowed orientations of the spin axis of
the electron with respect to any chosen axis. Finally, they proposed that the ratio of the
magnetic moment of the electron to its angular momentum was twice that associated with
the electron’s orbital motion. Ehrenfest encouraged them to write a short paper for Die
Naturwissenschaften and suggested that they should send it to Lorentz for comments. The
following week they received a long response from Lorentz on the properties of rotating
electrons. It revealed further ﬂaws with the picture, including the fact that the magnetic
energy would far exceed the rest mass energy of the electron and in fact would be greater
than that of the proton. Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit decided against publication, but Ehrenfest
had already sent the paper off to Die Naturwissenschaften in which it was published on
20 November 1925.
Reaction to the paper was mixed, Bohr welcoming the concept referring to it as ‘a very
welcome supplement to our ideas of atomic structure’ as an addendum to the version of
Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit’s paper which appeared in Nature (Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit,
1925b). Kronig reiterated his concerns about the concept of electron spin and introduced
a new problem, the effect of the spins of electrons which were assumed to be present in
the nucleus (Kronig, 1925). In 1926, however, the consensus of opinion changed when
the factor of 2 problem for the splitting of the ﬁne structure of hydrogen was solved
by Llewellyn Thomas (1926), who showed that a second-order relativistic term had been
neglected in working out the magnitude of the spin–orbit coupling of the spinning electron
about the nucleus, the effect referred to as Thomas precession.7 Speciﬁcally, the energy
shift associated with the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron μ and
the magnetic ﬂux density B which it experiences in its instantaneous rest frame is

that is, exactly half the magnetic spin–orbit interaction and with the opposite sign. This
calculation persuaded Pauli that electron spin had to be taken really seriously and was to
lead to his introduction of Pauli spin matrices in the following year.
The problems of understanding electron spin uncovered by the pioneers of quantum
mechanics were well-founded. It turned out that the concept was very effective in under-
standing the features of atomic spectra and could be readily incorporated into Land´e’s
vector model of the atom. It was emphasised by Pauli, however, that electron spin has the
property of ‘classically not-describable two-valuedness’ – spin is an intrinsic property of
the electron itself. It is not an angular momentum in the sense of classical mechanics, but
rather, as Pauli expressed it, ‘an essentially quantum-mechanical property’. This can be
appreciated from the fact that it vanishes if h →0. We will return to these features of spin
in Sect. 16.6.

The wave–particle duality
Despite Einstein’s advocacy and Millikan’s dramatic veriﬁcation of Einstein’s expression
for the relation between the frequency of the incident radiation and the stopping voltage
of the photoelectrons in the photoelectric effect (Sect. 3.7), the concept of light quanta was
not taken seriously by the majority of physicists. As expressed by Mehra and Rechenberg,1
‘. . . the large majority of physicists working on quantum theory . . . subscribed to what
Planck, Nernst, Rubens and Warburg wrote in 1913 about Einstein: “that he may have
sometimes missed the target in his speculations as, for example, in his theory of light-
quanta.” And during the following decade hardly anyone took light-quanta seriously until
there appeared a paper to settle this question completely: this was the paper presented by
Arthur Holly Compton in December, 1922.’ (Compton, 1923)
Compton demonstrated that the law of scattering of energetic X-rays by electrons in atoms
follows precisely from the assumption that the quanta of light have energy ε = hν and
momentum p = (hν/c) ik. This was irrefutable evidence for the wave–particle duality
which was to play a central role in the development of quantum theory.
9.1 The Compton effect
The story begins with Thomson’s classical analysis of the scattering of radiation by free
electrons which was described in Sect. 4.3.1. The cross-section for Thomson scattering is
σT =

6πϵ2
0m2ec4 = 8πr2
e

= 6.653 × 10−29 m2 ,
(9.1)
where re = e2/4πϵ0mec2 is the classical electron radius. The angular distribution of the
radiation is given by the expression for the differential cross-section for Thomson scattering
dσT = r2
e
2 (1 + cos2 α) d ,
(9.2)
where α is the angle between the incident beam and the direction of the scattered radiation.
Integrating (9.2) over solid angle gives (9.1).2 Barkla and Ayres showed that this formula
was a good description of the scattering of soft X-rays by electrons (Barkla and Ayres,
1911). For more energetic X-rays and γ -rays, however, the agreement was not so good and
in particular, the scattered X- and γ -rays were of lower energy than the incident radiation
(Gray, 1913). Gray repeated these experiment in 1920, again estimating the energies of the
scattered X-rays by their absorption properties. He concluded that:

‘the results we have obtained would be explained if we could always look on a beam of X-
rays or gamma-rays as a mixture of waves of deﬁnite frequencies, and if rays of a deﬁnite
frequency were altered in wavelength during the process of scattering, the wavelength
increasing with the angle of scattering.’ (Gray, 1920)
With the invention of the X-ray spectrograph by the Braggs, the tools were available for
more precise studies of the scattering of high energy X-rays (Bragg and Bragg, 1913a,b).
In 1921, the challenge was taken up by Compton who was the ﬁrst investigator to use a
Bragg spectrometer in combination with a ‘recording device’ to analyse the wavelengths
of the scattered radiation. He soon conﬁrmed the result that the scattered wavelength was
greater than the incident wavelength, stating,
‘in addition to scattered radiation, there appeared in the secondary rays a type of ﬂuorescent
radiation, whose wavelength was nearly independent of the substance used as the radiator,
depending only upon the wavelength of the incident rays and the angle at which the
secondary rays are examined.’ (Compton, 1922)
From the beginning the challenge was to understand the mechanism by which the wavelength
of the radiation increased on scattering. Compton examined what would be expected if ‘each
quantum of X-ray energy were concentrated in a single particle and would act as a unit on
a single electron’. The result of his calculations was his famous formula for the change of
wavelength of the X-rays as a function of scattering angle θ,
λ =
 h
mec

(1 −cos θ) .
(9.3)
In his classic experiment, he used the Kα line of molybdenum as the primary radiation
and graphite as the scatterer. The results were reported to the American Physical Society in
April 1923 and published a month later in the Physical Review (Compton, 1923). In fact, the
same relation had been worked out by Debye and submitted to the Physikalische Zeitschrift
only a month before Compton’s presentation (Debye, 1923). The change in wavelength
and the intensity of the radiation as a function of scattering angle θ were in excellent
agreement with the expectation of Einstein’s light quantum hypothesis (Fig. 9.1). Initially,
not all the experimenters could reproduce Compton’s results, but by the end of 1924, there

The wave–particle duality
was general agreement that these held good and that the particle nature of light quanta was
securely established. In June 1929, Werner Heisenberg wrote in a review article, entitled
The development of the quantum theory 1918–1928,
‘At this time [1923] experiment came to the aid of theory with a discovery which would
later become of great signiﬁcance for the development of quantum theory. Compton found
that with the scattering of X-rays from free electrons, the wavelength of the scattered rays
was measurably longer than that of the incident light. This effect, according to Compton
and Debye, could easily be explained by Einstein’s light quantum hypothesis; the wave
theory of light, on the contrary, failed to explain this experiment. With that result, the
problems of radiation theory which had hardly advanced since Einstein’s works of 1906,
1909 and 1917 were opened up.’ (Heisenberg, 1929)
In his reminiscences in the year before he died, Compton stated:
‘These experiments were the ﬁrst to give, at least to physicists in the United States, a
conviction of the fundamental validity of the quantum theory.’ (Compton, 1961)
9.2 Bose–Einstein statistics
One of the intriguing questions about Planck’s derivation of the black-body energy distri-
bution is why he obtained the correct answer using the ‘wrong’ statistical procedures. One
answer is that he may well have worked backwards from his deﬁnition of the entropy of
a set of oscillators in thermal equilibrium, as discussed in Sect. 2.6. The deeper answer
is that Planck had stumbled by accident upon the correct method of evaluating the statis-
tics of indistinguishable particles. These procedures were ﬁrst demonstrated by the Indian
mathematical physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in a manuscript entitled Planck’s law and the
hypothesis of light quanta, which he sent to Einstein in 1924 (Bose, 1924). Einstein imme-
diately appreciated its deep signiﬁcance, translated it into German himself and arranged for
it to be published in the journal Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik. Bose’s paper and his collaboration
with Einstein led to the establishment of the method of counting indistinguishable parti-
cles known as Bose–Einstein statistics, which differ radically from classical Boltzmann
statistics.
Bose was not really aware of the profound implications of his derivation of the Planck
spectrum. To paraphrase Pais’s account of his paper, Bose introduced three new features
into statistical physics:
(i) Photon number is not conserved.
(ii) Bose divides phase space into coarse-grained cells and works in terms of the numbers
of particles per cell. The counting explicitly requires that, because the photons are
taken to be identical, each possible distribution of states should be counted only once.
Thus, Boltzmann’s axiom of the distinguishability of particles is gone.
(iii) Because of this way of counting, the statistical independence of particles has gone.

9.2 Bose–Einstein statistics
These are profound differences as compared with classical Boltzmann statistics.3 As Pais
remarks,
‘The astonishing fact is that Bose was correct on all three counts. (In his paper, he
commented on none of them.) I believe there had been no such successful shot in the dark
since Planck introduced the quantum in 1900.’ (Pais, 1985)
The argument starts by dividing the volume of phase space into elementary cells.4
Consider one of these cells, which we label k and which has energy εk and degeneracy
gk, the latter meaning the number of available states with the same energy εk within that
cell. Now suppose there are nk particles to be distributed over these gk states and that the
particles are identical. Then, the number of different ways the nk particles can be distributed
over these states is
(nk + gk −1)!
nk!(gk −1)!
,
(9.4)
using standard procedures in statistical physics. This is the key step in the argument and
differs markedly from the corresponding Boltzmann result. In the standard Boltzmann
procedure, all possible ways of distributing the particles over the energy states are included
in the statistics, whereas in (9.4) duplications of the same distribution are eliminated because
of the factorials in the denominator.5 Notice that this is the point at which the statistical
independence of the particles is abandonned. The particles cannot be placed randomly in
all the cells since duplication of conﬁgurations is not allowed.
The result (9.4) refers only to a single cell in phase space and we need to extend it to all
the cells which make up the phase space. The total number of possible ways of distributing
the particles over all the cells is the product of all numbers such as (9.4), that is,
W =
1
k
(nk + gk −1)!
nk!(gk −1)!
.
(9.5)
We have not speciﬁed yet how the N = 
k nk particles are to be distributed among the k
cells. To do so, we ask as before, ‘What is the arrangement of nk over the states which results
in the maximum value of W?’ At this point, we return to the recommended Boltzmann
procedure. First, Stirling’s theorem is used to simplify ln W:
ln W = ln
1
k
(nk + gk −1)!
nk!(gk −1)!
≈

k
ln (nk + gk)nk+gk
(nk)nk(gk)gk
.
(9.6)
Now we maximise W subject to the constraints 
k nk = N and  nkεk = E. Using the
method of undetermined multipliers as before,
δ(ln W) = 0 =

δnk{[ln(gk + nk) −ln nk] −α −βεk} ,
so that
[ln(gk + nk) −ln nk] −α −βεk = 0 ,

The wave–particle duality
and ﬁnally
nk =
gk
eα+βεk −1 .
(9.7)
This is known as the Bose–Einstein distribution and is the correct statistics for counting
indistinguishable particles.
In the case of black-body radiation, we do not need to specify the number of photons
present. We can see this from the fact that the distribution is determined solely by one
parameter – the total energy, or the temperature of the system. Therefore, in the method of
undetermined multipliers, we can drop the restriction on the total number of particles. The
distribution automatically readjusts to the total amount of energy present, and so α = 0.
Therefore,
nk =
gk
eβεk −1 .
(9.8)
By inspecting the low frequency behaviour of the Planck spectrum, we ﬁnd that β = 1/kT ,
as in the classical case.
Finally, the degeneracy of the cells in phase space gk for radiation in the frequency
interval ν to ν + dν has already been worked out in our discussion of Rayleigh’s approach
to the origin of the black-body spectrum (Sect. 2.3.4). One of the reasons for Einstein’s
enthusiasm for Bose’s paper was that Bose had derived this factor entirely by considering
the phase space available to the photons, rather than appealing to Planck’s or Rayleigh’s
approaches, which relied upon results from classical electromagnetism. Planck’s analysis
was entirely electromagnetic and Rayleigh’s argument proceeded by ﬁtting electromagnetic
waves within a box with perfectly conducting walls. Bose considered the photons to have
momenta p = hν/c and so the volume of momentum, or phase, space for photons in the
energy range hν to h(ν + dν) is, using the standard procedure,
dVp = V dpx dpy dpz = V 4πp2 dp = 4πh3ν2 dν
c3
V ,
(9.9)
where V is the volume of real space. Now Bose considered this volume of phase space to
be divided into elementary cells of volume h3, following ideas ﬁrst stated by Planck in his
1906 lectures, and so the numbers of cells in phase space was
dNν = 4πν2 dν
c3
V .
(9.10)
He needed to take account of the two polarisation states of the photon and so Rayleigh’s
result was recovered,
dN = 8πν2
c3
dν
with
εk = hν .
(9.11)
We immediately ﬁnd the expression for the spectral energy density of the radiation
u(ν) dν = 8πhν3
c3
1
ehν/kT −1 dν .
(9.12)
This is Planck’s expression for the black-body radiation spectrum and it has been derived
using Bose–Einstein statistics for indistinguishable particles.

9.3 De Broglie waves
Einstein did not stop there, but went on to apply these new procedures to the statistical
mechanics of an ideal gas (Einstein, 1924, 1925). As he stated, the application of these
statistics to a monatomic gas leads to a ‘far-reaching formal relationship between radiation
and gas’. In particular, he realised that the expression he had derived for the ﬂuctuations in
black-body radiation in his remarkable paper of 1909 (Sect. 3.6) must apply equally for the
statistics of monatomic gases as well. It will be recalled that his expression (3.43) for the
ﬂuctuations of black-body radiation consists of two parts:
σ 2
ε2 =
hν
ε +
c3
8πν2V dν

.
(9.13)
This is a dramatic result. Simply from the statistics of indistinguishable particles, the
expression for the ﬂuctuations consists of one term associated with the statistics of non-
interacting particles according to the Maxwell–Boltzmann prescription and a second term
associated with interference phenomena due to the wave properties of the particles. For
these reasons, Einstein was particularly intrigued by the work of Louis de Broglie, which
was reported by Langevin at the Fourth Solvay Conference in April 1924. De Broglie
had made another ‘shot in the dark’, by ascribing wave properties to the electron. This
conjecture was to have profound implications for the development of quantum mechanics.
9.3 De Broglie waves
The experimental and theoretical development of quantum physics was largely concentrated
in the major centres in Germany, G¨ottingen, Munich and Berlin, as well as at Bohr’s Institute
in Copenhagen. Following the end of the First World War, communications were broken
between France and Germany and the rapid exchange of results and ideas was not possible
until the 1920s. Paris was somewhat off the main track of the development of quantum
theory, but in many ways this was an advantage for the remarkable insights which resulted
from Louis de Broglie’s research. Unlike the majority of German physicists, de Broglie
had no hesitation in adopting Einstein’s light-quantum hypothesis. From the very beginning
of his doctoral studies, his objective was to ﬁnd techniques for reconciling the wave and
particle descriptions of the behaviour of light. But he went much further and single-handedly
introduced the concept of matter waves which completed the wave–particle duality of matter
as well as light. Let us follow his reasoning.
De Broglie’s three important papers were published in Comptes Rendus (Paris) in 1923
and were brought together in a single paper in English in the Philosophical Magazine in 1924
(de Broglie, 1923a,b,c, 1924b). He noted that there are two different ways of associating
a frequency with a moving electron. He began by associating a frequency with the rest
mass energy of the particle through Planck’s relation hν0 = m0c2. If the particle moves at
velocity v, the frequency associated with the particle in the external frame of reference will
be greater since then hν = γ m0c2, where γ = (1 −v2/c2)−1/2 is the Lorentz factor. On the
other hand, because of time dilation between the frame of reference of the moving particle
and the external observer, time intervals are increased and so the ‘internal frequency’ is

The wave–particle duality
observed with a lower frequency ν1 = m0c2/γ . The relation between these frequencies is
ν1 = ν/γ 2 .
(9.14)
How are these frequencies to be interpreted? He identiﬁed ν with a ‘ﬁctitious wave’
associated with the motion of the particle which propagated at a ‘superluminal’ velocity
c2/v. Because the wave moved at a speed greater than the speed of light, it could not
transport energy. At time t = 0, the location of the particle and the wave coincided. At time
t, the particle had moved to the position x = vt and the amplitude of its internal periodic
motion would be observed to be sin(2πν1x/v). At the same time, the amplitude of the
‘ﬁctitious wave’ would be sin[2πν(t −xv/c2)] since its propagation speed is c2/v. But,
because of (9.14), it follows that the two wave motions are always in phase. Inverting the
argument, if the two waves are always to remain in phase, it follows that the ‘ﬁctitious
wave’ must propagate at speed c2/v.
Now de Broglie identiﬁes the speed of the ﬁctitious wave, c2/v, with the phase velocity
vph of the wave. Then, the packet of energy associated with the wave will be propagated at
the group velocity vg which in modern notation we write
vg = dω
dk .
(9.15)
We can write k = 2π/λ = 2πν/vph and so
vg =
dν
d

ν/vph

with
ν = 1
h
m0c2
(1 −β2)1/2
and
vph = c2/v = c/β ,
(9.16)
where we have written the speed of the electron as β = v/c. Evaluating the differential to
obtain vg, we ﬁnd vg = v, that is, the group velocity of the ﬁctitious waves is exactly equal
to the velocity of the electron. As de Broglie writes in his paper (de Broglie, 1923a),
‘The velocity of the moving body is the energy velocity of a group of waves having
frequencies ν = 1
h
m0c2
(1 −β2)1/2 and velocities c
β corresponding to very slightly different
values of β.’
This represents a key insight into how to reconcile the wave and particle properties of light
quanta. But much more is to follow.
Next, de Broglie notes a further suggestive result by comparing the path of a light ray
according to Fermat’s principle of least time in optics with that of a particle according to the
principle of least action. Fermat’s principle is that, in a medium of variable refractive index,
the path of a light ray is that which minimises the travel time between any two ﬁxed points,

(9.22)
This is exactly the same expression as (9.19). De Broglie immediately concluded:
‘The rays of the phase wave are identical with the paths which are dynamically possible.’
Now de Broglie makes the key assumption.
‘It seems quite necessary that the phase wave shall ﬁnd the electron in phase with itself.
That is to say “The motion can only be stable if the phase wave is tuned with the length
of the path.” ’
To achieve this, there must be an integral number of wavelengths around the orbit. Then,

The wave–particle duality
There is another way of looking at this result. Consider the circular motion of the electron
and its associated wave according to the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom. If Tr is the period
of the orbit of the electron, the ‘ﬁctitious wave’ and the electron would meet on their circular
orbit after a time τ given by equating the distance the ﬁctitious wave travels round the orbit,
(c2/v)τ, to the distance moved by the electron plus the circumference of the orbit, vτ + vTr.
Therefore, writing ds = vdt, we ﬁnd
τ =
v2/c2
1 −v2/c2 Tr .
(9.26)
Therefore, the internal phase of the electron is changed by
2πν1τ = 2πν0(1 −β2)1/2 ×
β2
1 −β2 Tr = 2π m0c2
h
Trβ2
(1 −β2)1/2 .
(9.27)
This should be set equal to 2πn so that the electron and ﬁctitious wave remain in phase.
For circular orbits, we therefore recover again the relation
 Tr
0
m0β2c2
h
0
1 −β2 dt =
# γ m0v
h
ds = n .
(9.28)
This is de Broglie’s famous formula for the quantisation of the ‘ﬁctitious waves’ which
travel at the phase velocity c2/v round the electron’s orbit. The associated group velocity at
which the energy of the wave-packet travels round the orbit is just the velocity of the particle
v. As he remarked later in his paper, ‘I think that these ideas may be considered as a kind
of synthesis of optics and dynamics’. The second paper also contained the prediction that
the conclusions of his papers applied to electrons as well as to quanta of radiation and that
‘a stream of electrons passing through a sufﬁciently narrow hole should also exhibit
diffraction phenomena.’ (de Broglie, 1923b)
The closing paragraph of his great paper shows due caution and yet optimism that these con-
siderations represented a signiﬁcant advance towards a proper theory of quantum mechanics.
‘Many of these ideas may be criticised and perhaps reformed, but it seems that now
little doubt should remain of the existence of light quanta. Moreover, if our opinions are
received, as they are grounded on the relativity of time, all the enormous experimental
evidence of the “quantum” will turn in favour of Einstein’s conceptions.’
De Broglie went on to submit his doctoral thesis Researches on the theory of quanta in
November 1923 to the Faculty of Science at the University of Paris (de Broglie, 1924a).
The examining committee, consisting of Perrin, Cartan, Mauguin and Langevin, praised
the striking originality of de Broglie’s researches but was sceptical of the physical reality
of the waves associated with the electrons. When asked about experimental tests of the
hypothesis, de Broglie proposed the diffraction of beams of electron by crystals. It was not
realised that experimental evidence for diffraction effects had already been discovered, as
we recount in the next section.
A second important outcome was that Langevin discussed de Broglie’s researches at the
Fourth Solvay Conference held in April 1924, in particular with Einstein. At that time,
Einstein was working on the implications of Bose’s paper described in the last section and

9.4 Electron diffraction
realised the signiﬁcance of de Broglie’s hypothesis for his theory of ideal gases, in particular,
for the energy ﬂuctuation formula and the ﬂuctuation component due to the wave aspects
of the particles. Einstein received a copy of de Broglie’s dissertation in December 1924. He
realised the signiﬁcance of these ideas stating:
‘I shall discuss the interpretation in greater detail because I believe that it involves more
than merely an analogy.’ (Einstein, 1925)
9.4 Electron diffraction
Einstein discussed de Broglie’s thesis with Born who in turn brought it to the attention of
James Franck, head of the department of experimental physics at G¨ottingen, and Born’s
student Walter Elsasser. When Elsasser suggested that electron diffraction experiments
might be attempted, Franck commented that this:
‘would not be necessary since Davisson’s experiments had already established the expected
effect.’
What Franck was referring to were the experiments of Davisson and Kunsman which had
shown considerable structure in the angular distribution of electrons scattered from nickel
surfaces (Davisson and Kunsman, 1921). They had interpreted these results in terms of the
scattering of electrons which penetrate one or more of the outer electron shells of the nickel
atoms at the surface of the crystal. Elsasser and Franck interpreted the structure in the
angular distribution of the scattered electrons differently as the peaks associated with the
scattering of the electrons by the nickel crystal. The characteristics of the scattered electrons
were similar to the well-known phenomena of the scattering of X-rays by crystal surfaces
and agreed with the expectations of de Broglie’s theory if the waves associated with the
electrons have wavelength λ = h/mv. Elsasser also showed that interference effects could
also explain the Ramsauer–Townsend effect, the fact that the cross-section for scattering
of slow electrons by rare gases, particularly that of argon, decreases to a very low value
below electron energies of 25 eV (Ramsauer, 1921; Townsend and Bailey, 1922). Elsasser’s
note on the interpretation of these phenomena was published in Die Naturwissenschaften
in August 1925 (Elsasser, 1925).
Davisson was not, however, convinced but continued his experiments on the scattering
of electrons by nickel crystals. The remarkable series of events which led to his famous dis-
covery is recounted in the opening paragraphs of his paper with Germer of 1927 (Davisson
and Germer, 1927).
‘The investigation reported in this paper was begun as the result of an accident which
occurred in this laboratory in April 1925. At that time we were continuing an investigation,
ﬁrst reported in 1921 (Davisson and Kunsman, 1921), of the distribution-in-angle of
electrons scattered by a target of ordinary (poly-crystalline) nickel. During the course of
this work a liquid-air bottle exploded at a time when the target was at a high temperature;
the experimental tube was broken, and the target heavily oxidized by the inrushing air.

The wave–particle duality
Fig. 9.2
The results of the Davisson and Germer electron scattering experiments. The curves labelled A and B show the
diffraction maximum before (A) and after (B) the heating and recrystallisation of the nickel crystals for the ‘54 volt’
electron beam (Davisson and Germer, 1927).
The oxide eventually reduced and a layer of the target removed by vaporization, but only
after prolonged heating at various temperatures in hydrogen and in vacuum.
When the experiments were continued it was found that the distribution-in-angle of the
scattered electrons had been completely changed.’
What had happened was that the original nickel sample consisted of a number of separate
crystals. The effect of the processing subsequent to the accident was that the separate crystals
were fused into a single nickel crystal with much improved diffraction capabilities. The
improvement is illustrated in Fig. 9.2 which shows the famous diffraction maximum at
an angle of 50◦using the original crystals and the larger single crystal. This maximum
disappeared if the accelerating voltage was appreciably changed. The separation a between
the planes of atoms in the nickel crystal, the grating constant, was 2.15 ˚A and so Bragg’s
formula for the diffraction of X-rays, nλ = 2πa sin θ, can be used to estimate the wavelength
λ of the incident beam, where n is an integer and θ is the angle between the incident ray
and the scattering planes. This formula resulted in a wavelength of λ = 1.65 ˚A, in perfect
agreement with the expectation of de Broglie’s formula λ = h/mv = (150/V )1/2 ˚A for an
accelerating voltage V = 54 V.
In fact these results were not published until 1927, although they were well-known
through discussions with Born, Hartree and others at the 1926 meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science held in Oxford. The clinching experiments
were carried out by George P. Thomson, the son of J. J. Thomson, and Andrew Reid at
the University of Aberdeen. They passed a collimated beam of electrons through a thin
ﬁlm of celluloid and the resulting diffraction pattern was similar to that observed in the
diffraction of X-rays of the same energy as the electrons (Thomson and Reid, 1927). In

Examples of photographs of the diffraction rings observed in electron diffraction experiments in which a beam of
electrons is incident upon thin films of different materials (Thomson, 1928).
a subsequent paper, Thomson (1928) demonstrated diffraction rings associated with the
passage of electrons through thin ﬁlms of gold, celluloid and other substances (Fig. 9.3).
There followed numerous experiments demonstrating the wave nature of the diffraction
of beams of electrons. The 1937 Nobel Prize for physics was awarded to Davisson and
Thomson. As famously remarked by Jammer (1989),
‘. . . Thomson, the father, was awarded the Nobel prize for having shown that the electron
is a particle, and Thomson, the son, for having shown that the electron is a wave.’
These electron diffraction experiments provided incontrovertible evidence for the correct-
ness of de Broglie’s deep insight into the wave–particle duality for light and matter. We
have, however, now run far ahead of the chronological unfolding of the story. Let us review
the status of the old quantum theory as it stood at the end of 1924.
9.5 What had been achieved by the end of 1924
The discussion of the last six chapters demonstrates the remarkable efforts undertaken by
many outstanding physicists and mathematicians to come to terms with the challenges posed
by the introduction of quantisation and quanta into the infrastructure of classical physics. It
will be recognised that most of the distinctive features which a successful quantum theory
had to encompass were already in place, but there was no coherent quantum theory which
could accommodate all of them, let alone the deeper implications of what these discoveries
implied for the understanding of the physical world. It is helpful to list what had been
achieved by the end of 1924.
r The Bohr model of the atom and the concept of stationary states which electrons can
occupy in orbits about the atomic nucleus (Chap. 4).
r The introduction of additional quantum numbers to account for multiplets in atomic
spectra and the associated selection rules for permitted transitions (Chap. 5 and Sects. 6.4
and 6.5).

The wave–particle duality
r Bohr’s correspondence principle which enabled classical physical concepts to inform the
rules of the old quantum theory (Sect. 6.3).
r The explanation of the Stark and Zeeman effects in terms of the effects of quantisation
upon atoms in electric and magnetic ﬁelds (Chap. 7).
r Land´e’s vector model of the atom which could account for the splitting of spectral lines
in terms of the addition of angular momenta according to the prescription given by the
expression for the Land´e g-factor (Sect. 7.4).
r The experimental demonstration of space quantisation by the Stern–Gerlach experiment
(Sect. 7.5).
r The concept of electron shells in atoms and the understanding of the electronic structure
of the periodic table (Chap. 8).
r The discovery of Pauli’s exclusion principle and the requirement of four quantum numbers
to describe the properties of atoms (Sect. 8.3).
r The discovery of electron spin as a distinctive quantum property of these particles –
although inferred from angular momentum concepts, the intrinsic spin of the electron is
not ‘angular momentum’ in the sense of rotational motion (Sect. 8.4).
r The conﬁrmation of the existence of light quanta as a result of Compton’s X-ray scattering
experiments (Sect. 9.1).
r The discovery of Bose–Einstein statistics which differed very signiﬁcantly from classical
Boltzmann statistics (Sect. 9.2).
r The introduction of de Broglie waves associated with the momentum of the electron
and the extension of the wave–particle duality to particles as well as to light quanta
(Sect. 9.3).
The reader will immediately recognise that the above list is the product of hindsight,
highlighting features which would have to be incorporated into a new theory of what was
to become quantum mechanics. The old quantum theory could not accommodate these into
a single coherent theory. In essence, the old quantum theory can be considered classical
physics with the addition of the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantisation rules, namely,
#
pφ dφ = nh ,
(9.29)
as well as a set of selection rules to ensure that the observed optical and X-ray spectral
features could be reproduced.
Besides the problems of coherence, there was the highly non-trivial problem that, al-
though the properties of the hydrogen atom could be explained rather well by the Bohr–
Sommerfeld model, the next element in the periodic table, helium with two electrons rather
than one and twice the positive nuclear charge, deﬁed explanation despite the strenuous
efforts of many theorists. For heavier elements, the problems were no simpler.
But even more fundamentally, the stability of atoms, particularly the decay of the electron
orbits because of the emission of electromagnetic radiation had no satisfactory solution.
The old quantum theory got round this problem by simply requiring that accelerated
electrons at the atomic level did not radiate electromagnetic radiation. The best that could
be done was to assert that Bohr’s stationary states genuinely were ‘stationary’ and at the
atomic level the continuous loss of energy did not occur. Energy loss only occurred in

transition between stationary states. Einstein had proposed how this could be formalised
in his remarkable introduction of spontaneous and induced transition probabilities between
stationary states and, as we will see, this was to be the touchstone for the development of
approaches which would ultimately lead to the revolution of a genuine theory of quantum
mechanics. Something had gone profoundly wrong with classical mechanics and dynamics
at the atomic level – the solution of that problem was to prove to be truly revolutionary.

The collapse of the old quantum theory and
the seeds of its regeneration
‘In spite of its high-sounding name and its successful solutions of numerous problems
in atomic physics, quantum theory, and especially the quantum theory of polyelectron
systems, prior to 1925, was, from the methodological point of view, a lamentable hodge-
podge of hypotheses, principles, theorems and computational recipes rather than a logical
consistent theory. Every single quantum-theoretic problem had to be solved ﬁrst in terms
of classical physics; its classical solution had then to pass through the mysterious sieve of
the quantum conditions or, as it happened in the majority of cases, the classical solution
had to be translated into the language of quanta in conformance with the correspondence
principle. Usually, the process of ﬁnding the ‘correct solution’ was a matter of skillful
guessing and intuition, rather than of deductive or systematic reasoning.’ (Jammer, 1989)
Although written with the beneﬁt of hindsight, there is no doubt that, by the end of 1924,
there was a major crisis in the attempts to create a system of ‘quantum mechanics’1 which
could encompass all the features of atoms and their spectra. At the heart of the problem
was the wave–particle duality ﬁrst enunciated by Einstein in 1905 and reinforced by de
Broglie’s remarkable association of ‘matter-waves’ with electrons in 1924. As recorded by
Jammer (1989),
‘This state of affairs was well characterised by Sir William Bragg when he said that
physicists are using on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays the classical theory and on
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays the quantum theory of radiation.’
The transition from the old quantum theory to the completed theory of quantum mechanics
took place remarkably rapidly, over a period of only a few years, but it was not a simple
story. Born remarked that it was not even ‘a straight staircase upward’, but rather a ‘tangle
of interconnected alleys.’
The story begins with one of the thorniest problems, the understanding of the physics of
the dispersion of light by material media. Despite the apparently intractable nature of the
problem, the attempts to unravel it were to lead to new approaches which would soon lead
to a radically new description of physics at the atomic level.
10.1 Ladenburg, Kramers and the theory of dispersion
The dispersion problem is at the heart of the interaction between matter and radiation.
Classically, the dispersion of electromagnetic waves results from the dependence upon
frequency of the refractive index of the medium through which the waves propagate. The

The collapse of the old quantum theory
simplest example occurs in continuous media in which there is a linear dependence of the
polarisation P of the medium upon the applied electric ﬁeld strength E, P = χϵ0E, where
χ is the electric susceptibility of the medium. It is straightforward to solve the ﬁrst two
of Maxwell’s equations (1.5) and (1.6) for an incident electromagnetic wave. In a linear
medium,
D = ϵ0E + P = (1 + χ)ϵ0E = ϵϵ0E ,
(10.1)
where ϵ is the relative permittivity of the material. Going through the standard procedure2
of reducing (1.5) and (1.6) to a wave equation in E or H, the speed of propagation
of the waves is (ϵϵ0μ0)−1/2 = c/√ϵ. The refractive index of the material n = √ϵ is a
readily measurable quantity. The term dispersion is used to describe the phenomena which
occur when the refractive index is a function of frequency, resulting in the ‘dispersion’ or
‘smearing out’ of the frequency components of a wave-packet.
In the presence of an absorption line, there is a strong dependence of χ upon frequency
and it had been established empirically that the variation of χ with frequency could be
written in the form
χi = e2
me
fi
ω2
i −ω2 ,
(10.2)
where ωi is the central frequency of the absorption line and fi is a constant, the signiﬁcance
of which will become apparent shortly.
A relation of this form can be derived from classical electromagnetic theory and, in
fact, we have already almost derived it in Sect. 2.3.3 – the classical theory of dispersion
was expounded by Paul Drude (1900). Formally, the polarisation P is the dipole moment
per unit volume of the material,3 in this case, induced by the electric ﬁeld of the incident
electromagnetic wave. For convenience, we repeat the formula (2.9) which describes the
motion of an oscillator of natural angular frequency ω0 under the inﬂuence of an incident
electromagnetic wave:
¨x + γ ˙x + ω2
0x = F
me
.
(10.3)
For simplicity, we take the reduced mass of the oscillator to be the electron mass me. If
the oscillator is accelerated by the E ﬁeld of an incident wave, F = eE0 exp(iωt). To ﬁnd
the response of the oscillator, a trial solution for x of the form x = x0 exp (iωt) is adopted.
Then
x0 =
eE0
me

ω2
0 −ω2 + iγ ω
 .
(10.4)
The complex factor in the denominator means that the oscillator does not vibrate in phase
with the incident wave. The dipole moment of the oscillator is p = ex with respect to its
rest position and so, for a single oscillator, multiplying through by e, we ﬁnd
p =
e2E0

0 −ω2 + iγ ω

(10.6)
Thus, provided the frequency is not too close to the resonance frequency ω0, the second
term in square brackets in the denominator can be neglected and the expression for the
electric susceptibility χ0 of a single oscillator is
χ0 =
e2
me

ω2
0 −ω2 ,
(10.7)
exactly the same as the relation (10.2). Summing over all the oscillators with angular
frequencies ωi in unit volume of the material, Drude’s formula for the electric susceptibility
is obtained,
χ =

i
e2
me
fi
ω2
i −ω2 ,
(10.8)
where the factor fi was interpreted by Drude as the ‘number of dispersion electrons’ per
atom. The same formula was derived by Pauli in his important review of 1926 where fi was
referred to as the ‘strength’ of the oscillator (Pauli, 1926). This variation of the dispersion
in the vicinity of an absorption line was known as anomalous dispersion. If measurements
of the anomalous dispersion were measured away from the line centre, the value of fi could
be measured for the oscillator.
The seeds of a new approach to the wave–particle duality were contained in a paper by
Ladenburg (1921) who combined Drude’s theory with Einstein’s quantum theory of the
emission and absorption of radiation (Einstein, 1916) discussed in Sect. 6.2. Consider a
system of N oscillators each of mass me, charge e and oscillation frequency ν0 = ω0/2π
in thermal equilibrium in an enclosure. The classical average energy loss rate of a single
oscillator is given by (2.4),
−dE
dt = γ E ,
(10.9)
where γ = ω2
0e2/6πϵ0c3m. The radiation loss rate of the system of oscillators Jcl was
written in the following form by Ladenburg,
Jcl = U N
τ
,
(10.10)
where τ = 1/γ and U is the mean energy of each oscillator. As shown by Planck, the mean
energy of the oscillator is directly related to the mean energy density of radiation within
the enclosure. In Sect. 2.3.3, this relation was derived for the case in which the motion of
the electron could be modelled by three orthogonal oscillators and so for a single oscillator,
(2.20) can be written,
u(ν0) = 8πν0
3c3 U = 2ω2
0
3πc3 U .

192
The collapse of the old quantum theory
Notice that u(ν0) is the energy density of radiation per unit frequency interval. Therefore,
substituting for U in (10.10), the classical rate of loss of energy of the oscillator in the
enclosure can be written
Jcl =
e2
4ϵ0me
Nu(ν0) .
(10.12)
This expression relates the rate of loss of energy directly to the spectral energy density
u(ν0) of the radiation ﬁeld at frequency ν0.
Ladenburg now tackled the same problem from the quantum theoretical point of view
using the Einstein A and B coefﬁcients discussed in Sect. 6.2:
An
m = 8πhν3
c3
Bn
m
and
Bn
m = Bm
n .
(10.13)
m labels the lower energy state εm and n the upper state εn and so hν0 = εn −εm. The rate
of absorption of energy by the set of oscillators is therefore
Jqu = hν0Nm Bn
mu(ν0) .
(10.14)
Ladenburg next used Bohr’s correspondence principle to equate the classical energy loss
rate to the quantum theoretical rate of absorption of energy, Jcl = Jqu, and so from (10.13),
N = Nm
ϵ0mec3
2πν2
0e2 An
m .
(10.15)
According to Bohr, the correspondence principle should only be applied to transitions
between states with large principal quantum numbers, but Ladenburg assumed that (10.15)
should apply for all quantum transitions. Next, he identiﬁed N/Nm with fi, the number of
oscillators per atom derived in (10.8). We recall that classically Drude identiﬁed fi as the
number of dispersion electrons per atom. In Ladenburg’s exposition, Nm is taken to be the
number of atoms in the ground state. Therefore,
fi = ϵ0mec3

m .
(10.16)
Thus, Ladenburg had derived an expression for Einstein’s spontaneous emission coefﬁcient

m in terms of measurable quantities since fi can be found from the frequency dependence
of the polarisation properties of the medium. Inserting (10.16) into (10.8), we ﬁnd the

This expression can be thought of as describing the amplitude of the varying electric dipole
moment of the medium which is to account for dispersion phenomena. But, implicitly
Ladenburg had made a crucial conceptual advance, which was not explicitly stated in his
paper. As noted by van der Waerden (1967),
‘Ladenburg replaced the atom, so far as its interaction with the radiation ﬁeld is concerned,
by a set of harmonic oscillators with frequencies equal to the absorption frequencies ν0
of the atom.’

10.1 Ladenburg, Kramers and the theory of dispersion
This was explicitly recognised by Bohr, Kramers and Slater (1924) who referred to the
model as consisting of a set of virtual oscillators.
The result (10.17) was generalised by Kramers (1924) for the case in which the lower
state of the transition was not the ground state. In this case, he argued that (10.17) should
include the contribution of virtual oscillators with energies ε < εn. To convert (10.17) into
a more convenient form, let us label the energy level of the state we are interested in as i,
higher energy states by k and lower energy states by k′. Then, ν0 = νik = (εk −εi)/h and
νk′i = (εi −εk′i)/h. Thus, (10.19) becomes
P = χ E = ϵ0Ec3
8π3

k

(10.18)
Kramers showed that a similar additional term to that in (10.17) should be included when
the transitions are not to the ground state so that the full expression of the polarisation
would read
P = χ E = ϵ0Ec3

(10.19)
Kramers realised that this second term had a somewhat curious signiﬁcance, but that it had
to be there. As he wrote in his paper to Nature,
‘The reaction of the atom against the incident radiation can thus be formally compared
with the action of a set of virtual harmonic oscillators inside the atom, conjugated with
the different possible transitions to other stationary states. . . . one might introduce the
following terminology: in the ﬁnal state of the transition the atom acts as a “positive
virtual oscillator” of relative strength + f ; in the initial state, it acts as a negative virtual
oscillator of strength −f . However unfamiliar this “negative dispersion” might appear
from the point of view of the classical theory, it may be noted that it exhibits a close
analogy with the “negative absorption” which was introduced by Einstein, in order to
account for the law of temperature radiation on the basis of the quantum theory.’
The connection with the correspondence principle was rubbed home in the last sentence of
his paper
‘It may be remembered, however, that the presence of the second term in [10.19] is
necessary if the classical theory can be applied in the limiting region where the motions
in successive stationary states differ by only small amounts from each other.’
Kramers did not give the proof of (10.19) in his paper of 1924, but it was derived in detail
in his paper with Heisenberg in the following year (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925).
Without going through the details of that proof, we can understand why the second term
on the right-hand side of (10.19) is necessary. It will be recalled that, in Einstein’s derivation
of Planck’s formula using Einstein’s A and B coefﬁcients, it is essential to incorporate the
induced emission term in order to obtain the correct form of the black-body spectrum in
the long wavelength, or Rayleigh–Jeans, limit. If the term is omitted, the Wien, rather than
the Planck, distribution is obtained. Now, according to the correspondence principle, the
classical and quantum formalisms should coincide in the limit of large quantum numbers

The collapse of the old quantum theory
and this corresponds exactly to the Rayleigh–Jeans region of the Planck spectrum. This
explains why the ‘negative virtual oscillators’ need to be included in (10.19). This important
feature of the formalism was clariﬁed in a paper by John van Vleck (1924). Again, the
correspondence principle provides guidance about what the correct form of the quantum
relations has to be.
10.2 Slater and the Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory
The next contribution to the ‘tangle of interconnected alleys’ was made by John C. Slater
who completed his doctorate at Harvard University in 1923 and arrived in Copenhagen as
a Sheldon Fellow of Harvard University in 1924. The source of Slater’s insight came from
the difﬁculty of reconciling the classical picture of electromagnetic waves with Einstein’s
concept of light quanta. In particular, how could exact conservation of energy and momen-
tum be maintained when a continuous electromagnetic wave interacted with the discrete
energy levels within atoms? As expressed by Jammer (1989),
‘. . . it was hard to understand how, for example, in a system composed of an electromag-
netic radiation ﬁeld, susceptible of only continuous changes of energy, and an aggregate of
atoms, emitting and absorbing only discrete quanta of energy, the sum total of a continuous
and of a discrete amount of energy could be a constant. . . . But there was an alternative:
one could reject the energy principle as an exact law and regard it merely as a statistical
law.’
This concept had been advocated by Darwin (1922) who remarked that,
‘. . . as pure dynamics has failed to explain many atomic phenomena, there seems no reason
to maintain the exact conservation of energy, which is only one of the consequences of
the dynamical equations.’
Darwin’s paper of 1922 on the quantum theory of dispersion contained within it ideas
which were to be taken over by Slater. In particular, according to Darwin’s theory, when an
electromagnetic wave interacts with an atom, the atom acquires a probability of emitting
a spherical wave-train which interferes with the incident waves, the probability being a
function of the intensity of the incident radiation.
Slater (1924) went much further, suggesting that, so long as an atom is in a stationary state,
each atom can communicate with all other atoms through the action of a virtual radiation
ﬁeld originating from the virtual oscillators which have frequencies associated with the
quantum transitions between stationary states – these are the same virtual oscillators which
were introduced by Ladenburg and Kramers in their theory of dispersion. Here are Slater’s
own words.
‘Any atom may, in fact, be supposed to communicate with other atoms all the time it is in a
stationary state, by means of a virtual ﬁeld of radiation originating from oscillators having
the frequencies of possible quantum transitions and the function of which is to provide for
the statistical conservation of energy and momentum by determining the probabilities for

10.2 The Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory
quantum transitions. The part of the ﬁeld originating from the given atom itself is supposed
to induce a probability that that atom loses energy spontaneously, while radiation from
external sources is regarded as inducing additional probabilities that it gain or lose energy,
much as Einstein has suggested. The discontinuous transition ﬁnally resulting from these
probabilities has no other signiﬁcance than simply to mark the transfer to a new stationary
state, and the change from the continuous radiation appropriate to the old state to that of
the new.’
Slater’s vision was that the resultant virtual ﬁeld would determine the paths of the light
quanta and also determine the probability that they propagate in a particular direction.
Bohr and Kramers discussed these ideas intensively with Slater on his arrival in Copen-
hagen. Bohr was still not convinced of the reality of light quanta, despite the evidence of
Compton’s experiments on the inelastic scattering of X-rays (Sect. 9.1). The results of these
discussions was the paper by Bohr, Kramers and Slater (1924) which adopted many of
Slater’s ideas, but not those involving light quanta. They explicitly stated that the laws of
energy and momentum conservation were only to refer to statistical averages, rather than
to individual interactions. Two quotations will serve to illustrate the radical nature of the
proposal.
‘Further, we will assume that the occurrence of transition processes for the given atom
itself, as well as for the other atoms with which it is in mutual communication, is con-
nected with this mechanism by probability laws which are analogous to those which in
Einstein’s theory hold for the induced transitions between stationary states when illumi-
nated by radiation. On the one hand, the transitions which in this theory are designated
as spontaneous are, on our view, considered as induced by the virtual ﬁeld of radiation
which is connected with the virtual harmonic oscillators conjugated with the motion of
the atom itself. On the other hand, the induced transitions of Einstein’s theory occur in
consequence of the virtual radiation in the surrounding space due to other atoms.’
‘As regards the occurrence of transitions, . . . we abandon . . . any attempt at a causal con-
nexion between the transitions in distant atoms, and especially a direct application of the
principles of conservation of energy and momentum, so characteristic for the classical
theories.’
Thus, not only has conservation of energy and momentum at the microscopic level been
abandoned, causality has gone as well. There is no formal working out of these ideas in their
paper, which Pais refers to as a proposal rather than a theory and also as being ‘obscure in
style’ (Pais, 1991).
The Bohr, Kramers and Slater paper presented several experimental and theoretical chal-
lenges to the community. First of all, it was a challenge to the experimenters to demonstrate
the validity of the conservation of energy and momentum at the microscopic atomic level.
As Bohr, Kramers and Slater pointed out, the Compton scattering experiments were based
upon statistical averages rather than on individual scattering events. Experimental evidence
on the issue of the validity of the conservation laws was not long in coming. Bothe and
Geiger carried out Compton scattering experiments using early coincidence techniques,
in which they measured the arrival times of the scattered X-rays and the ejected K-shell
electrons (Bothe and Geiger, 1924). The likelihood of the coincidences they observed

ber experiments by Compton and Simon (1925) in which they determined the direction and
time of ejection of the electron from the target. They veriﬁed that one recoil electron is
produced on average for each scattered X-ray photon. Occasionally a secondary electron
track was created by the X-ray and from these measurements, the geometry of the collision
could be determined. They found the ‘unequivocal answer’ that the Compton collisions
obeyed precisely the expectations of the laws of conservation of energy and momentum at
the atomic level. As they stated
‘. . . the results do not appear to be reconcilable with the view of the statistical production
of recoil and photo-electrons by Bohr, Kramers and Slater. They are, on the other hand, in
direct support of the view that energy and momentum are conserved during the interaction
of radiation and individual electrons.’
Thus, although it was evident that classical dynamics could not account for physics at the
atomic level, the laws of conservation of energy and momentum still had to hold good.
Although the Bohr, Kramers and Slater proposal was shown to be incorrect in a remark-
ably short space of time, the paper itself was inﬂuential in that it rejected many of the
fundamental tenets of classical physics. The paper was widely discussed and illustrated the
necessity for quite different approaches to physics on the scale of atoms. Van der Waerden
summarised the three radical elements of the paper as follows (van der Waerden, 1967):
1. Slater’s concept of a virtual radiation ﬁeld associated with the virtual oscillators of
atoms;
2. The statistical conservations of energy and moment;
3. The statistical independence of the processes of emission and absorption of radiation.
The legacy of the paper was that the ﬁrst postulate was to prove to be correct, whilst
the second and third were in conﬂict with experiment. Following the intense discussions
stimulated by the paper, Kramers went on to make his contributions to the understanding
of the formula for the phenomena of dispersion, culminating in the major paper with
Heisenberg which was discussed in the last section (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925). In
turn, these considerations were to prove to be crucial for Heisenberg when he made the ﬁrst
major advances in the development of a completely new approach to quantum physics.
Equally important was the fact that in these works the concept of atoms was gradually
being displaced by a much more abstract concept of how physical processes should be
envisioned at the atomic level. Jammer noted that the introduction of virtual oscillators and
virtual radiation ﬁelds
‘paved the way for the subsequent quantum-mechanical concept of probability as some-
thing endowed with physical reality and not merely a mathematical category of reasoning.’
Atoms were to be thought of as systems which consisted of virtual oscillators which were
coupled to other atoms by virtual radiation ﬁelds associated with the oscillators. In the
development which we are about to trace, the concept of atoms themselves became much
more abstract. This was part of the penalty which had to be paid in coming up with a set of
rules to replace the laws of classical dynamics.

10.3 Born and ‘quantum mechanics’
10.3 Born and ‘quantum mechanics’
The inadequacy of the old quantum theory to account for physics on the scale of atoms was
now a central theme of the leading theoretical groups, nowhere more so than at G¨ottingen
where Max Born and his colleagues were searching for new approaches to the problem of
translating the structures of classical physics to the atomic domain. This change of attitude
is reﬂected in Born’s important paper of 1924 (Born, 1924). In the introduction to the paper
he wrote,
‘Since one knows that, in certain circumstances, atoms react to light waves completely
“non-mechanically” (i.e. they are excited by quantum jumps), it is not to be expected that
the interaction between electrons of one and the same atom should comply with the laws
of classical mechanics; this disposes of any attempt to calculate the stationary orbits by
using a classical perturbation theory complemented by quantum rules.’
He had been strongly impressed by the radical proposals by Bohr, Kramers and Slater and by
Kramers’ paper in which the dispersion formula had been derived. In particular, Kramers’
derivation of the dispersion relation involved the interaction between light and the virtual
oscillators and resulted in a quantum formulation for the process of dispersion while at the
same time satisfying the correspondence principle in the long wavelength limit. The object
of Born’s paper was to extend this formalism to the case of the interactions of electrons
within atoms. The ambition of the paper was to ﬁnd out whether or not Kramers’ approach
to quantisation was founded on some more general properties of perturbed mechanical
systems at the quantum level. In Born’s words,
‘What we shall do, is to bring the classical laws for the perturbation of a mechanical
system, caused by the internal couplings or external ﬁelds, into one and the same form,
which would very strongly suggest the formal passage from classical mechanics to a
“quantum mechanics”.’
For the ﬁrst time, the term quantum mechanics appears in the literature.
Born begins by developing the classical theory of the perturbation of multiply periodic
non-degenerate systems of the type discussed in Sect. 5.5. As discussed in Sect. 5.4, action–
angle variables provide the natural system of coordinates for such motions. The perturbed
Hamiltonian is written in the form
H = H0 + λH1 ,
(10.20)
where the perturbation H1 is given by a Fourier series. These procedures were by now well-
established in the literature, particularly because of the success of the formalism in the old
quantum theory. It was also familiar from the perspective of the dynamics of astronomical
systems where multiply periodic systems, such as the orbits of the planets, are subject to
small perturbations. Having set up the formalism, Born shows that, if the perturbation is
associated with incident electromagnetic waves, the classical expression for the dispersion
is obtained.
Born now makes the key innovation of this paper by showing how to translate the
formalism of classical mechanics to a ‘quantum mechanics’. The argument depends upon

The collapse of the old quantum theory
two relations which we have already derived. The ﬁrst is the use of action–angle variables
as the natural system of coordinates for the description of multiply periodic motions, such
as the orbits of electrons in atoms. As demonstrated in Sect. 5.5, the orbital frequency is
given by (5.121),
νi = ∂H
∂Ji
,
(10.21)
where H is the Hamiltonian which is the total energy in this case. The second is the ap-
plication of Bohr’s correspondence principle according to which the classical and quantum
relations should coincide for large quantum numbers and for small changes in the principal
quantum number n. This was demonstrated for the hydrogen atom in Sect. 6.3. There, the
key relation (6.18) can be written
ν = ανe ,
(10.22)
where α = n and νe is the orbital frequency of the electron in the orbit with principal
quantum number n, νe = mee4/4ϵ2
0h3n3. Classically, (10.22) has a natural interpretation in
that α = 1 corresponds to the orbital frequency of the electron and α = 2, 3, 4, . . . corre-
spond to the Fourier components of the orbital motion which can always be decomposed
into a series of harmonics. Combining (10.21) and (10.22), the formula for the frequencies
of the lines becomes
να = ανe = α dH
dJ .
(10.23)
Let us now write Bohr’s quantum frequency condition for the action variable J as follows:
J = nh and so
hν(n, n −τ) = E[J(n)]−E[J(n −τ)] ,
that is
ν(n, n −τ) = H[J(n)]−H[J(n −τ)]
h
.
(10.24)
In the limit in which n is very large and τ = 1, 2, 3, . . . small, a Taylor expansion of the
last term on the right-hand side of (10.24) gives
ν(n, n −τ) = 1
h
dH
dJ J
and, since J = hτ,
ν(n, n −τ) = τ dH
dJ .
(10.25)
Thus, the classical and quantum formulae (10.23) and (10.24) become the same in the limit
of large quantum numbers, satisfying Bohr’s correspondence principle. The last term in
(10.25) can also be written
ν(n, n −τ) = τ dH
dJ = τ
h
dH
dn .
(10.26)
Born’s key insight was that the translation between the classical and quantum prescrip-
tions involved replacing the differential τ dH/dn, by the difference H(n) −H(n −τ). Born
then postulates that this translation should apply more generally to all transitions between
the classical and quantum formulations. Thus, for any arbitrary function φ(n) which de-
ﬁnes the stationary state n, the differential τ dφ/dn should be replaced by the difference
φ(n) −φ(n −τ). Symbolically,
τ dφ(n)
dn
←→φ(n) −φ(n −τ) .

10.3 Born and ‘quantum mechanics’
This will play an important role in the future development of the structure of the theory.
For convenience, Jammer (1989) refers to this equivalence as Born’s correspondence rule.
Born then went on to show how, using this formulation, Kramers’ quantum dispersion
formula (10.19) could be derived. While Born was working on this paper, Heisenberg was
his assistant at G¨ottingen and he contributed to the calculations carried out in the paper. As
Born acknowledges in a footnote
‘By happy coincidence, I was able to discuss the contents of this paper with Mr. Niels Bohr
which contributed greatly to a clariﬁcation of the concepts. I am also greatly indebted to
Mr. W. Heisenberg for much advice and help with the calculations.’ (Born, 1924)
Heisenberg was only 22 years old at the time, but with his quick grasp of physical concepts
and his technical expertise, he greatly beneﬁtted from these studies with Born. He next
spent the winter of 1924–1925 in Copenhagen working with Bohr and Kramers. It was
there that he and Kramers worked out the full quantum theory of scattering and dispersion
discussed in Sect. 10.1 (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925). Their rigorous development of the
theory started with the classical picture and then the transition to the quantum formulation
was achieved by replacing the differential quotients ∂/∂J by the appropriate difference
quotients, according to Born’s correspondence rule.
Their result for the polarisation in the state i was given by an expression similar to
(10.19) which we quoted above from Kramers’ paper (Kramers, 1924), but with a signiﬁcant
difference in notation. Using (10.16) to write the polarisation in terms of fki rather than
Ak
i , their expression can be written
Pi = χi E =
e2E

⎥⎥⎦.
(10.28)
In the classical development fi was the number of dispersing electrons in the state i, whereas
in the new formulation the fik are not necessarily integers. They are better described as the
oscillator strengths, the terminology introduced by Pauli.
Although the signiﬁcance of the fiks has changed from the classical meaning, there is
an important relation discovered by Kuhn (1925) and independently by Thomas (1925)
concerning the sum of all the oscillator strengths of a given state i. Use is again made
of the correspondence principle. Let us ﬁrst simplify the notation by writing fa for the
fki, meaning absorption transitions from the state i and fe for the fik′, meaning induced
emission terms which must appear according to the analyses of Kramers and van Vleck.
Consider now the limit in which the frequency ν is very much greater than νki and νik′.

10.4 Mathematics and physics in G¨ottingen
The developments described in this chapter were the last contributions prior to Heisenberg’s
epochal paper of 1925 which was to lead eventually to quantum mechanics as we know
it today. The theoretical work was carried out principally in G¨ottingen and Copenhagen,
under the guidance of a number of distinguished experimental and theoretical physicists.
The Copenhagen Institute for Theoretical Physics was a very recent foundation, thanks to
the efforts of Bohr, and very quickly became an international centre of excellence in all
aspects of quantum physics. The most distinguished theorists visited Bohr regularly and
were put through the most rigorous examinations of their researches, principally by Bohr
himself.
The development of mathematical, theoretical and experimental research in G¨ottingen
was very different.4 There had been chairs of physics and mathematics in the University of
G¨ottingen since the mid-eighteenth century. The great tradition of mathematics research was
established by Carl Friedrich Gauss who became Professor of Mathematics in 1807. Gauss’s
vast contributions to mathematics need not be elaborated here, except to note that he strongly
encouraged the application of mathematics to physical problems and made many important
contributions. Wilhelm Weber was appointed to the Professorship of Physics in 1831 and
was at the forefront of the theoretical attack upon the problems of electromagnetism.

10.4 Mathematics and physics in G¨ottingen
Gauss was succeeded by a galaxy of distinguished mathematicians including Lejeune
Dirichlet, Bernhard Riemann, Alfred Clebsch and Felix Klein – Arnold Sommerfeld was
a student of Klein. In a separate appointment, David Hilbert became Director of the
Mathematics Institute in 1895. Four new institutes were founded in 1905 to complement
the existing Physics and Mathematics Departments and the Astronomical Observatory,
the Director of which was Karl Schwarzschild. The new institutes were the Geophysical
Institute, the Institute of Applied Electricity, the Institute of Applied Mechanics and the
Institute of Applied Mathematics, the respective directors being Emil Weichert, Hermann
Theodor Simon, Ludwig Prandtl and Carl Runge.
David Hilbert’s appointment as Professor of Mathematics led to a remarkable ﬂowering
of research in mathematics, what Mehra and Rechenberg describe as
‘a school of phenomenal brilliance, which had never been equalled before in the history
of mathematics.’5
In 1900, Hilbert enunciated his 23 great problems of mathematics, which were to challenge
the greatest mathematicians for the next century (Hilbert, 1900). Hilbert was not only
interested in pure mathematics, however, but also in its application to physics and in 1902
he laid out his plans for a closer involvement of mathematics in physics. In 1903, he attracted
his old friend from K¨onigsberg, Hermann Minkowski, to the Chair of Mathematics but sadly
Minkowski died in 1909 of appendicitis. This event interrupted Hilbert’s plans for physics,
but his endeavours were greatly helped by the endowment of the Wolfskehl Prize for the
proof of Fermat’s last theorem, which has already appeared in our story in connection
with Bohr’s Wolfskehl lectures of 1922 (Sect. 8.2). While Fermat’s last theorem remained
unsolved, the Mathematical Institute was allowed to use the interest on the capital, which
amounted to about 5,000 marks per year, to endow the series of Wolfskehl lectures. Hilbert
was encouraged by his colleagues to submit a solution to Fermat’s last theorem, but Hilbert
refused, remarking
‘Why should I kill the goose that lays the golden egg?’
Hilbert and Klein wanted to keep abreast of developments in physics, remarking that
‘Physics is much too hard for physicists’. As discussed in Sect. 8.2, Hilbert used the interest
on the Wolfskehl endowment to invite distinguished lecturers in physics to G¨ottingen on a
regular basis. Poincar´e delivered the lectures in 1909, Lorentz in 1910 and Sommerfeld in
1912. The sixth of the 23 problems which Hilbert had formulated in his 1900 lecture was
‘to establish the axioms of theoretical physics’.
In pursuit of this objective, he invited Einstein in the summer of 1915 to lecture on the
development of the general theory of relativity. In late 1915, just weeks after the appear-
ance of Einstein’s great paper of 1915, Hilbert independently derived the ﬁeld equations
of general relativity (Hilbert, 1915). In fact, he went signiﬁcantly further. In his axiomatic
approach, he assumed that, as in general relativity, at each point in space-time 10 gravita-
tional potentials gμν (μ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4) are required to describe the gravitational ﬁeld and
four potentials Aμ (μ = 1, 2, 3, 4) for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. From these potentials,
he formulated a Hamiltonian, a ‘world-function’ H, which depended on the gμν and their
ﬁrst and second spatial derivatives and the Aμ and their spatial derivatives. The ﬁrst axiom

asserted that the laws of physics should be determined by taking the variations of the inte-
gral

H√g dx4, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor gμν. The second axiom
was the ‘axiom of general invariance’ according to which H must be invariant with respect
to arbitrary coordinate transformations. From these axioms, Hilbert showed that general
relativity and a generalised form of Maxwell’s equations could be derived. Klein went on
to unify the different analyses of energy–momentum conservation in general relativity by
Einstein, Hilbert and Lorentz. In a further brilliant analysis, Emmy Noether, a student of
Hilbert and Klein, established the relationship between conservation laws and symmetry
(Noether, 1918).
Hilbert and Klein took the view that this ﬁeld-theoretic approach had solved Hilbert’s
problem 6 and provided the basis for the future development of theoretical physics. Although
Einstein admired greatly Hilbert’s deep understanding of mathematical physics, he was not
an enthusiast for Hilbert’s approach to ﬁeld theory. Nonetheless, he continued to develop
the ﬁeld-theoretic approach and this resulted in his long, and in the end fruitless, endeavours
to ﬁnd a uniﬁed ﬁeld theory. It would turn out that the breakthrough did not come from the
Einstein–Hilbert approach, but from a quite different route.
In 1919, Klein retired from his position as Professor of Mathematics because of ill health
and was succeeded by Richard Courant, who was not only an outstanding mathematician,
but also an excellent organiser. He began a series of monographs on Fundamental Topics
of Mathematical Sciences in Monographs. Signiﬁcantly, No. 12 of the series was the ﬁrst
volume of the famous monograph The Methods of Mathematical Physics by Courant and
Hilbert (1924). The book was based upon those aspects of Hilbert’s lectures which found
application in theoretical physics. This monograph set out systematically the mathematical
tools needed to tackle the mathematical physics of quantum theory. Courant also developed
ambitious plans for a mathematical institute similar to the institutes for the experimental
sciences and his success in this endeavour resulted in the opening of the Mathematical
Institute in 1929.
In physics, the older generation was represented by Rieche and Voigt but they supported
the researches of the new generation of physicists which included Max Abraham, Johannes
Stark and Walther Ritz. In 1920, Rieche retired and was replaced by Pohl. In the same year,
Debye left for Zurich and by good fortune it proved possible to appoint simultaneously
James Franck to the chair of experimental physics and Max Born to the chair of theoretical
physics.
This remarkable battalion of mathematicians and physicists was about to tackle the quite
different horizons opened up by Heisenberg’s new insights. Once the way was shown,
the strength of mathematical physics meant that the development of the theory proceeded
rapidly. The glory years were to continue until 1933 when the Nazi prohibition on those
of Jewish descent from holding university positions wreaked havoc with the brilliance of
G¨ottingen mathematics and physics. From the G¨ottingen faculties alone, Hermann Weyl,
Richard Courant, Edmund Landau, Emmy Noether, Max Born and James Franck all emi-
grated in the face of Nazi oppression.

The Heisenberg breakthrough
11.1 Heisenberg in G¨ottingen, Copenhagen and Helgoland
Werner Heisenberg studied under Sommerfeld in Munich and was present at the Bohr
Festspiele held in G¨ottingen in 1922 (Sect. 8.2). Although aged only 20, he challenged
Bohr’s support of Kramers’ analysis of the quadratic Stark effect, having studied the paper
in detail for Sommerfeld’s seminar in Munich. The result was a long walk with Bohr during
which they discussed this topic and the more general problems of quantum physics. This
encounter made a strong impression on Heisenberg. Much later Heisenberg stated:
‘That discussion, which took us back and forth over Hainberg’s wooded heights, was the
ﬁrst thorough discussion I can remember on the fundamental physical and philosophical
problems of modern atomic theory, and it has certainly had a decisive inﬂuence on my
later career. For the ﬁrst time, I understood that Bohr’s view of his theory was much more
sceptical than that of many other physicists – for example, Sommerfeld – at that time, and
that his insight into the structure of the theory was not a result of mathematical analysis
of the basic assumptions, but rather of an intense occupation with the actual phenomena,
such that it was possible for him to sense the relationships intuitively rather than derive
them formally.’
Heisenberg spent the winter of 1922–1923 working in G¨ottingen as Born’s assistant.
The astronomers had made great progress in the use of perturbations techniques within the
action–angle formulation of classical dynamics to study the gravitational perturbations of
planetary orbits. Born and Heisenberg adapted these procedures to the case of the orbits of
electrons in atoms, in particular, the problem of the two-electron helium atom. Although
some qualitative features of the helium atom could be accounted for, the quantitative results
did not agree with experiment (Born and Heisenberg, 1923a,b).
Born was so impressed by Heisenberg’s abilities that, following Pauli’s departure from
G¨ottingen, he asked Sommerfeld if he would release Heisenberg to become his assis-
tant once he had completed his doctoral dissertation in Munich. Sommerfeld agreed to
this. Heisenberg completed his PhD dissertation on turbulence in Munich and returned to
G¨ottingen in October 1923 as Born’s assistant. Born has provided a portrait of Heisenberg
at that time.
‘He looked like a simple peasant boy, with short, fair hair, clear bright eyes and a charming
expression. He took his duties as an assistant more seriously than Pauli and was a great
help to me. His incredible quickness and acuteness of apprehension has always enabled
him to do a colossal amount of work without much effort: he ﬁnished his hydrodynamical

The Heisenberg breakthrough
thesis, worked on atomic problems partly alone, partly in collaboration with me, and
helped me to direct my research students.’ (van der Waerden, 1967)
In the course of his studies with Sommerfeld in Munich and with Born in G¨ottingen,
Heisenberg perfected his use of their approaches and techniques, in which well-deﬁned
mechanical problems were tackled systematically according to the precepts of the old
quantum theory. He had already encountered Bohr’s quite different approach during the
1922 Wolfskehl lectures. Bohr had also been deeply impressed by Heisenberg’s abilities
and invited him to Copenhagen for a visit in March 1924. Bohr took a personal interest
in Heisenberg’s intellectual development which was deepened during a three-day walking
tour through the island of Zealand. Whereas Sommerfeld and Born were interested in the
solution of well-posed problems which were solved by rigorous mathematics, Bohr was
much more interested in the underlying physical concepts which he related to the results
of experiment. In this, he was much more akin to Einstein for whom physical concepts
were the basis of theory which were then elaborated using the appropriate mathematical
tools. Heisenberg appreciated that Bohr was thinking deeply and philosophically about the
underlying physical concepts which had to be incorporated into a new system of quantum
mechanics – Heisenberg’s speciﬁc interests in the Zeeman effect and the problems of
multi-electron atoms paled into insigniﬁcance in the light of Bohr’s deeper concerns.
During early 1924, Bohr was preoccupied with the development of the Bohr–Kramers–
Slater theory which sought to incorporate the concept of light quanta into the Bohr–
Sommerfeld picture of the atom, at the expense of the exact conservation of energy and
momentum in interactions between matter and radiation (Sect. 10.2) (Bohr et al., 1924).
At the same time, Kramers was developing his improved version of Ladenburg’s theory of
dispersion by replacing the atom by a collection of virtual oscillators (Sect. 10.1) (Kramers,
1924). The collaboration between Copenhagen and G¨ottingen intensiﬁed during this period
and, during a visit by Bohr to G¨ottingen, he invited Heisenberg to visit for a more extended
period during the winter semesters of 1924–1925. Heisenberg duly arrived in Copenhagen
in September 1924.
Kramers, who was ﬁve years older than Heisenberg, had been a collaborator of Bohr’s
since 1916 and had become Bohr’s principal assistant when the Institute for Theoretical
Physics in Copenhagen was opened in 1920. Initially, Heisenberg was somewhat in awe of
Kramers’ sophistication and technical ability but they soon became good friends. During
this longer visit, Heisenberg fully absorbed the ‘Bohrian’ approach and, in particular,
became an adherent of the correspondence principle and its reﬁnement in tackling the
problems of quantum physics. It was during this period that Kramers and Heisenberg
developed the much more complete quantum picture of the dispersion of light incorporating
Born’s correspondence rule (Sect. 10.3) (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925). Also, during his
visit, Heisenberg revisited the thorny problems of the anomalous Zeeman effect and the
interpretation of complex spectra.
In April 1925, Heisenberg returned to Germany, taking ﬁrst a well-deserved break in
Southern Germany before taking up his position as a Privatdozent at G¨ottingen at the
beginning of the next semester. With Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan and Friedrich Hund, Born
had assembled a very powerful team for theoretical physics and spectroscopy in G¨ottingen.

11.2 Quantum-theoreticalre-interpretation
In the meantime, Bohr had become more pessimistic about his recent researches. The
Bohr–Kramers–Slater picture was no longer tenable in the light of the experiments of
Bothe and Geiger (1924) and he lost faith in the models of multi-electron atoms and
complex spectra, which were the basis of Heisenberg’s researches at Copenhagen. As a
result, Heisenberg changed the direction of his research to the study of the intensities
of the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. His reasoning was that hydrogen is a single
electron system and so is not subject to the difﬁculties of helium or multi-electron atoms.
His intention was to apply Born’s correspondence rule for quantisation to the radiation of
the electron in circular and elliptical orbits about the nucleus. To achieve this, he had to
develop Fourier series in two dimensions for elliptical orbits and this programme rapidly
became prohibitively complex. Instead, he turned to a simpler problem, the emission of a
nonlinear oscillator. As we will discuss in Sect. 11.5, the nonlinear oscillator has the feature
that higher harmonics of the fundamental frequency can be found by recursive formulae.
Some of these ideas were foreshadowed in correspondence with Kronig in 1922.
By 1925, as the old quantum theory seemed to be irretrievably incapable of accounting
for the experimental data, Heisenberg decided that a more radical approach was needed,
inspired by the success of Ladenburg’s, Kramers’ and Born’s quite different approach to the
interaction of radiation with atoms. As discussed in Chap. 10, the orbits of electrons in atoms
were dispensed with and replaced by virtual oscillators with frequencies corresponding to
the observed lines in the spectra of atoms. In an inspired application of the correspondence
principle, Heisenberg argued that the Born approach to quantisation should be applied, not
only to quantities such as the frequencies of the virtual oscillator, but also to the kinematics
of the electron itself. The great, and profound, insight was that the spatial position of
the electron x(t) should be subject to the Born correspondence rule. In other words, the
classical kinematics of Galileo and Newton had to be replaced by their quantum theoretical
counterparts. The breakthrough occurred in June 1925 when Heisenberg suffered a severe
bout of hay fever. To recover, he took a break on the barren German island of Helgoland
in the North Sea – with its offshore climate, the island is almost free of pollen. During
the nine or ten days he was there, he worked out the mathematics of these ideas. On his
way back to G¨ottingen, he discussed his new ideas with Pauli in Hamburg, and then in
G¨ottingen wrote up his paper on the subject, sending it to Pauli for his urgent consideration.
Although notoriously critical, Pauli was impressed. Born recognised the signiﬁcance of what
Heisenberg had achieved and submitted it for publication to the Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik. This
paper marks the beginning of the major change of direction which was needed to develop
a consistent theory of quantum mechanics. Let us investigate exactly what Heisenberg did.

The Heisenberg breakthrough
faced by the old quantum theory (Heisenberg, 1925). Mehra and Rechenberg (1982b) point
out the remarkable similarities to Einstein’s great paper of 1905, On the electrodynamics of
moving bodies (Einstein, 1905c), which established the new framework of special relativity
and which abolished the concepts of absolute space and time. In contrast to Einstein’s paper,
which is a complete exposition of the underlying physics of the special theory of relativity,
Heisenberg’s paper is a work in progress.
Heisenberg’s summary at the beginning of the paper is as follows:
‘The present paper seeks to establish a basis for theoretical quantum mechanics founded
exclusively upon relations between quantities which in principle are observable.’
He begins by reviewing the well-known problems of the old quantum theory and states
unambiguously that
‘the Einstein–Bohr frequency condition (which is valid in all cases) already represents
such a complete departure from classical mechanics, or rather . . . from the kinematics
underlying this mechanics, that even for the simplest quantum theoretical problems the
validity of classical mechanics cannot be maintained.’
But he has a further concern. The old quantum theory is based upon calculations of the
orbits and orbital frequencies of electrons in atoms and he contends that these are unob-
servable quantities. The quantities which are observable are the frequencies and intensities
of emission and absorption lines – the positions of electrons in atoms are in principle un-
observable. Much later, this concept would be incorporated into Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle, but that was still a long way in the future. He goes on:
‘In this situation, it seems sensible to discard all hope of observing hitherto unobservable
quantities, such as the position and period of the electron, and to concede that the partial
agreement of the quantum rules with experience is more or less fortuitous. Instead, it
seems more reasonable to try to establish a theoretical quantum mechanics, analogous to
classical mechanics, but in which only relations between observable quantities occur.’
Heisenberg later stated that he had been strongly inﬂuenced by Einstein’s paper on special
relativity of 1905 in his insistence upon considering only observable quantities. The crucial
ﬁrst part of Einstein’s paper is entitled Kinematical part and demolishes Newton’s concepts
of absolute space and time. Space and time need to be deﬁned in terms of measurable
quantities with the result that simultaneity becomes relative, the key concept of the relativity
of simultaneity (Rindler, 2001). By using the two principles of relativity, namely that the
laws of physics should be form-invariant between inertial frames of reference and that
the speed of light is a constant in all such frames, Einstein discovered operationally self-
consistent deﬁnitions of space and time. To express this in another way, what had gone
wrong with Newtonian physics was the description of the kinematics of particles, that is,
the way in which points in four-dimensional space-time are described. The new kinematics
of particles and light waves are fully derived in this ﬁrst kinematical part of Einstein’s great
paper and are embodied in the Lorentz transformations.
Heisenberg was about to carry out a similar revolution in the concept of kinematics on the
scaleof atoms. Hewas tobeguidedbytheinsights gainedfromKramers’, Born’s andhis own

11.3 The radiation problem
studies of dispersion phenomena. In particular, he was to use Born’s correspondence rule
to create a quantum mechanics in which only relations between observables are permitted.
Heisenberg’s paper is not the easiest to comprehend. As we will see, even physicists
such as Enrico Fermi and Steven Weinberg1 have found the content difﬁcult and somewhat
obscure. The problem is compounded by changes of notation which Heisenberg adopted
in the course of the paper.2 Another problem is that Heisenberg does not describe how the
results he presents were obtained. These problems are addressed and resolved in an impres-
sive paper by Ian Aitchison and his colleagues (2004) which will be used in the exposition
which follows. In the following sections, I have translated Heisenberg’s arguments into a
single self-consistent notation which I hope does justice to the revolutionary content of the
paper.
11.3 The radiation problem and the translation
from classical to quantum physics
In the next part of the paper (Sect. 1), the basic postulates of the new approach are laid out,
in particular, the way in which the correspondence rule is to be used to translate between
classical and quantum physics. Heisenberg begins with the formula for the intensity of
emission in classical electrodynamics. First of all, he notes that the standard results for
dipole radiation are only the ﬁrst step in the evaluation of higher order terms associated
with quadrupole and higher multipoles of the acceleration history of the electron. These
can all be determined by ﬁrst taking the Fourier transform of the motion of the electron and
then working out the intensity of radiation associated with each Fourier component. But,
he has a deep insight – in his words,
‘The point has nothing to do with electromagnetism but rather – and this seems particularly
important – is of a purely kinematic nature. We may pose the question in its simplest form
thus: If instead of a classical quantity x(t) we have a quantum-theoretic quantity, what
quantum-theoretic quantity will take the place of x(t)2.’
We can appreciate his line of thinking by recalling the expression for the dipole radiation
of an oscillator. In the simplest case of dipole radiation, the radiation rate is given by (2.1),
namely
−
dE
dt

rad
=
| ¨p|2
6πϵ0c3 = e2|¨r|2

(11.1)
For the case of an oscillator performing simple harmonic oscillations with amplitude x0 at
angular frequency ω0, x = |x0| exp(iω0t) and then the average radiation loss rate is given
by (2.3),

The Heisenberg breakthrough
Let us note some features of this expression which were important for the pioneers of
quantum mechanics. The electric ﬁeld strength at distance r from the accelerated charge in
the far ﬁeld limit is given by the expression
Eθ = | ¨p| sin θ
4πϵ0c2r = e|¨x| sin θ
4πϵ0c2r = eω2
0|x0| sin θ
4πϵ0c2r
,
(11.3)
where p = er is the dipole moment of the electron. The radiation loss rate (11.1) is
obtained from (11.3) by integrating the Poynting vector ﬂux S = |E × H| = E2
θ/Z0 of the
emitted radiation over 4π steradians, that is, over 1
2 sin θ dθ, where Z0 = (μ0/ϵ0)1/2 is the
impedance of free space. The total radiation rate can be related to Einstein’s coefﬁcient
An
m for spontaneous emission by the following argument. We recall that An
m is deﬁned for
the isotropic emission of the oscillator, whereas (11.2) corresponds to the dipole emission
of a single oscillator. Just as we argued in Sect. 2.3.3, we obtain the isotropic result if we
consider the total loss rate to be associated with three mutually perpendicular oscillators.
Then, we ﬁnd
hν0 An
m = 3 × ω4
0e2|x0|2
12πϵ0c3
;
An
m = ω3
0e2|x0|2
2ϵ0c3h
.
(11.4)
Note the key result that An
m is the probability of spontaneous emission and that it depends
upon the square of the amplitude of the oscillator |x0|2. This is why Heisenberg asks the
question, ‘. . . what quantum-theoretic quantity will take the place of x(t)2?’
There is one further link between |x0| and electrodynamics. In the classical theory of the
emission of electromagnetic waves, it is simplest to derive the expression for the electric
ﬁeld strength E of the wave from the vector potential A using the relations
A = μ0

r = μ0

ev

E = −∂A
∂t = −
e¨r
4πϵ0c2r = −

(11.5)
Thus, for an oscillator of angular frequency ω0,
|E| = −
8888
∂A
∂t
8888 = ω0|A| .
(11.6)
Thus, comparing (11.3) and (11.6), the magnitude of the vector potential is also proportional
to |x0|, the maximum displacement of the oscillator.
After this mild detour into classical electrodynamics, let us return to the development of
Heisenberg’s paper. He takes the radical point of view that what had gone wrong with the
old quantum theory is that the spatial coordinates x0 should be replaced by their quantum
analogues. This is a dramatic step. As remarked by Jammer (1989),
‘Heisenberg, inﬂuenced by both Sommerfeld and Bohr, considered now the possibility
of ‘guessing’ – in accordance with the correspondence principle – not the solution of a
particular quantum-theoretic problem but the very mathematical scheme for a new theory
of mechanics. By integrating in this way the correspondence principle once and for all in
the very foundations of the theory, he expected to eliminate the necessity of its recurrent
application to every problem individually without jeopardising its general validity.’
A key difference which has to be built into this translation is that, according to classical
electrodynamics, the radiation rate depends only upon one quantum number, the principal

11.3 The radiation problem
quantum number n which determines the orbital frequency of the electron – there may also
be higher harmonics of the orbital frequency, but essentially the radiation depends only on
orbital frequency. This is formalised by (10.23) in which the classical frequencies of the
emission are given by
ν(α) = αν0 = α dW
dJ ,
(11.7)
where α is an integer, α = 1, 2, 3, . . . . In the old quantum theory, the orbit with principal
quantum number n has action variable J = nh and then (11.7) becomes
ν(n, α) = αν(n) = α dW
dJ = α 1
h
dW
dn .
(11.8)
In contrast, Bohr’s frequency relation necessarily depends upon the properties of two
states through the relation
ν(n, n −τ) = 1
h [W(n) −W(n −τ)] ,
(11.9)
where the Ws represent the binding energies of the stationary states and τ = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
There is also a contrast in the ways in which combinations of frequencies are added in
classical and quantum theory. Classically, for the case of radiation of harmonics α and β
associated with principal quantum number n, the combination rule is
ν(n, α) + ν(n, β) = ν(n, α + β) .
(11.10)
This type of combination of frequencies occurs in the nonlinear coupling between the
harmonics α and β. The corresponding quantum combination rule for the virtual oscillators
associated with transitions from the stationary state n to n −τ ′ and then to n −τ ′ −τ is
Ritz’s combination principle (Sect. 1.6) which Heisenberg writes:
ν(n, n −τ ′) + ν(n −τ ′, n −τ ′ −τ) = ν(n, n −τ ′ −τ) ,
(11.11)
ν(n −τ, n −τ ′ −τ) + ν(n, n −τ) = ν(n, n −τ ′ −τ) .
(11.12)
Notice the important point that at the atomic level, the classical frequency rule corresponds
to the frequency of the electron’s orbit and its harmonics, whereas the quantum theoretical
rule does not depend upon the orbital frequency, but upon the energy differences between
the three states deﬁned by n, n −τ ′ and n −τ ′ −τ; the associated frequencies in (11.11)
and (11.12) are all observables. This completes the ﬁrst part of Heisenberg’s agenda of
working only in terms of observable quantities.
The second part is to work out the intensities and polarisations of the radiation emitted
in the quantum transitions. Classically, the motion of the electron in an orbit with principal
quantum number n can be represented by a Fourier series expansion in harmonics of the
orbital frequency,
x(n, t) =

α
x(n, α) eiω(n)αt ,
(11.13)
where the sum extends over all positive and negative integral values of α, that is, 
α is
taken to mean α=+∞
α=−∞. From the requirement that x(n, t) must be real, it follows that
x(n, −α) = x∗(n, α), where x∗(n, α) is the complex conjugate of x(n, α).

The Heisenberg breakthrough
To ﬁnd the value of |x2| in the classical case, we multiply together the Fourier series
for x(n, t) and its complex conjugate, obtaining a double sum over the products of the
components of x(n, α). Since the Fourier series extends from −∞to +∞and the αs are
integers, we obtain the same result if we write
x(n, t) =

α′
x(n, α′) eiω(n)α′t =

α′
x(n, α′ −α) eiω(n,α′−α)t .
(11.14)
The complex conjugate of the last expression is 
α′ x(n, α −α′) eiω(n,α−α′)t and so we can
write for |x2| the double sum over α′ and α,
x2(n, t) =

α′
x(n, α′) eiω(n)α′t

×

α
x(n, α −α′) eiω(n)(α−α′)t

.
(11.15)
Multiplying out the components, the double sum can be rewritten
x2(n, t) =

α

α′
x(n, α′) x(n, α −α′) eiω(n)α′t eiω(n)(α−α′)t

.
(11.16)
Because of the rule (11.10), it immediately follows that the product of exponents in (11.16)
is eiω(n)αt and so the double sum can be reduced to the form
x2(n, t) =

α
x(2)(n, α) eiω(n)αt ,
(11.17)
where
x(2)(n, α) =

α′
x(n, α′) x(n, α −α′) .
(11.18)
From Heisenberg’s perspective this is the key result since x2(n, t) can now be represented
by the sum over Fourier components, or ‘virtual oscillators’, with frequencies αω(n) which
are directly related to the intensities of radiation through expressions of the form (11.2), in
other words, to the intensities and polarisations of the ‘virtual oscillators’.
Heisenberg now seeks the quantum theoretical equivalent for x(n, t). According to Bohr’s
correspondence principle, the quantum theoretical frequency ν(n, n −τ) corresponds to
ν(n, α) and so by analogy the quantity x(n, n −τ) corresponds to the Fourier component
x(n, α). This translation can be written symbolically
ν(n, α) ←→ν(n, n −τ)
and so
x(n, α) ←→x(n, n −τ) .
(11.19)
Notice that I am maintaining a clear distinction between the αs, which represent harmonics
of the fundamental frequency ω0, and τ which labels different stationary states of the
electron in the atom. But this procedure immediately encounters the problem that there is
no unique way in which x(t) can be represented by a sum over the quantities x(n, n −τ)
which depend upon two variables. Nonetheless, Heisenberg presses on with the following
statement:
‘However, one may regard the ensemble of quantities x(n, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)t] as a
representation of the quantity x(t) and then attempt to answer the above question: how is
the quantity x2(t) to be represented?’

11.3 The radiation problem
Consequently, Heisenberg seeks the quantum equivalent of (11.17) which can be written
x2(n, t) =

τ
x(2)(n, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)]) .
(11.20)
The next step is to ﬁnd the quantum theoretical equivalent of (11.18) for x(2)(n, n −τ).
These will be the quantities which can be inserted into the classical formula for dipole
radiation and so determine the intensities of the transitions with angular frequency ω(n, n −
τ).
Let us make the replacements (11.19) in (11.16). Then, the τ component of the outer
sum, the quantity in square brackets in (11.16), becomes

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) x[n, n −(τ −τ ′)] exp[iω(n, n −τ ′)t] exp[iω(n, n −(τ −τ ′))t] .
(11.21)
The problem with this replacement is that it does not result in terms with frequency
ω(n, n −τ). The quantum frequency addition rule (11.11) derived from Ritz’s combination
principle is
ω(n, n −τ ′) + ω(n −τ ′, n −τ ′ −τ) = ω(n, n −τ ′ −τ) ,
(11.22)
and so the sum in the exponential term in (11.21)
ω(n, n −τ ′) + ω[n, n −(τ −τ ′)]
(11.23)
is clearly unacceptable. Heisenberg was therefore driven to the ‘almost cogent’ conclusion
that the sum of the frequency factors had instead to satisfy the relation
ω(n, n −τ) = ω(n, n −τ ′) + ω(n −τ ′, n −τ) .
(11.24)
Consequently, (11.21) had to be rewritten as follows

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ ′)t] exp[iω(n −τ ′, n −τ)t]
=

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ)

exp[iω(n, n −τ)t] .
(11.25)
The quantum theoretical expression for x(2)(n, n −τ) therefore has to be
x(2)(n, n −τ) =

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′)x(n −τ ′, n −τ) ,
(11.26)
rather than (11.18). This is the new quantum theoretical multiplication rule which replaces
the classical expression (11.18). The quantities x(n, n −τ) can be thought of as transition
amplitudes since the square of their moduli determine the transition probabilities between
the states n and n −τ.
Heisenberg immediately carried out the same procedure to determine x3(n) and also
wrote down the expression for the product of two quantities xn and yn. If we write
x(n, α) ↔x(n, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)t] ,
y(n, α) ↔y(n, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)t] ,

The Heisenberg breakthrough
then, in general, xnyn ̸= ynxn. This can be understood by writing out the product as a sum
over the components τ ′ according to the prescription (11.25). Then, in general,

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) y(n −τ ′, n −τ) ̸=

τ ′
y(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ) .
(11.28)
The new multiplication rule of quantum mechanics is non-commutative and this result
seriously worried Heisenberg. It turned out, however, to be a key innovation of Heisenberg’s
paper.
11.4 The new dynamics
Undaunted by the puzzle of non-commuting variables, Heisenberg proceeded to the second
section of his paper which deals with the mechanics of particles incorporating the new
kinematics. According to the procedures of the old quantum theory, the analysis begins
with the classical equation of motion, for example,
¨x + f (x) = 0 ,
(11.29)
and this equation is solved classically. The phase integral J =
$
p dq = nh is then
introduced to satisfy the quantum conditions. In the one-dimensional case, p = m ˙x,
dq = dx = ˙x dt and so
J =
#
m ˙x2 dt = nh .
(11.30)
Heisenberg now evaluates J according to classical physics and then translates the result to
quantum physics using the new kinematics. First, x is written classically as a Fourier series,
exactly as in (11.13):
x = x(n, t) =

α
x(n, α) eiω(n)αt .
(11.31)
It follows that
m ˙x = m
+∞

−∞
x(n, α) iαω(n) eiω(n)αt .
(11.32)
We now form ˙x2, by multiplying ˙x by its complex and integrating over a period of the
motion t = 2π/ω(n). All the products of the series except those involving products such
as x(n, α)x(n, −α) are zero on integrating over one period. We also recall that x(n, −α)
conjugate is the complex conjugate of x(n, α) and so the integral over one period of the
motion is
J =

11.4 The new dynamics
Now the quantum condition J = nh is applied, but Heisenberg immediately takes
the derivative of nh with respect to n, preparing the way for the application of Born’s
correspondence rule,

(11.35)
Born’s correspondence rule (10.27) tells us that differentials are to be replaced by differences
according to the recipe
α dφ(n)
dn
←→φ(n) −φ(n −τ) .
(11.36)
This had been generalised by Kramers and Heisenberg (1925) in their theory of dispersion
as follows:
α dφ(n, τ)
dn
←→φ(n + τ, n) −φ(n, n −τ) .
(11.37)
In making this translation, the angular frequency of the α harmonic and the amplitude
x(n, α) are translated as
φ(n + τ, n) :
αω(n) ←→ω(n, n + τ)
;
x(n, α) ←→x(n, n + τ) , (11.38)
φ(n −τ, n) :
αω(n) ←→ω(n, n −τ)
;
x(n, α) ←→x(n, n −τ) . (11.39)
Consequently, (11.35) becomes

|x(n, n + τ)|2ω(n, n + τ) −|x(n, n −τ)|2ω(n, n −τ)

,
(11.40)
where we have used the fact that x is real to convert the sum from −∞to +∞to twice
that from 0 to +∞since |x(n, τ)|2 = |x(n, −τ)|2. Furthermore, the values of the xs can be
determined absolutely since there is a requirement that, in the ground state n0, no emission
processes are possible to a lower energy state, in other words, x(n0, n0 −τ) = 0 for τ > 0.
These are remarkable calculations, as Heisenberg realised:
‘Equations [(11.29)] and [(11.40)], if soluble, contain a complete determination not only
of frequencies and energy values, but also of quantum theoretical transition probabilities.
However, at present the actual mathematical solution can be obtained only in the simplest
cases.’
The concept is that the equation of motion is solved in terms of Fourier components and
then these values entered into the quantum theoretical relation (11.40) which incorporates
the quantisation conditions. But much more is obtained since the quantities x(n0, n0 −τ)
are directly related to transition probabilities. Heisenberg noted in a footnote that (11.40)
can be simply reduced to the Kuhn–Thomas relation by relating the values of x(n0, n0 −τ)
to Einstein’s A coefﬁcient for spontaneous emission and to the values of the oscillator

The Heisenberg breakthrough
We have already derived the relation between the Einstein A coefﬁcient and fi in (10.16),
namely,
fi = ϵ0mec3
2πν2
0e2 An
m .
(11.41)
We also showed in (11.4) how An
m can be related to |x0|2,
An
m = ω3
0e2|x0|2
2ϵ0c3h
.
(11.42)
Inserting this value for An
m into (11.41), we ﬁnd the relation
|x0|2ω0 =
h
πme
fi .
(11.43)
Now, we make use of the correspondence rule to write
[|x0|2ω0]a ←→|x(n, n + τ)|2ω(n, n + τ) =
h
πme
fa ,
(11.44)
[|x0|2ω0]e ←→|x(n, n −τ)|2ω(n, n −τ) =
h
πme
fe .
(11.45)
Inserting these relations for absorption from and induced emission into the quantum state n
into (11.40), Heisenberg demonstrated that the new formalism resulted in the Kuhn–Thomas
formula (10.34).3
This simple reduction illustrates how the new formalism operates entirely in terms of
observables, namely, the energies of the stationary states, the frequencies of emission and
the transition probabilities between states.
11.5 The nonlinear oscillator
Heisenberg realised that his new formalism could only be applied to the simplest cases. He
had already attempted to quantise the orbits of an electron in the hydrogen atom, but even
this case proved to be prohibitively complicated. Instead, in the third section of his paper,
he treats ﬁrst the case of the nonlinear oscillator and then a rotator in which an electron
orbits the nucleus at constant distance a. This is the most difﬁcult section of the paper
since Heisenberg gives no indication of how he obtained the results quoted. The paper
by Aitchison and his colleagues (2004) makes a convincing case for the route Heisenberg
probably followed to obtain these results and we will follow that exposition. The working
out requires a great deal of algebraic manipulation, but, as we have already noted, Born
commented that Heisenberg’s
‘. . . incredible quickness and acuteness of apprehension has always enabled him to do a
colossal amount of work without much effort.’ (van der Waerden, 1967)
On ﬁrst reading, the reader may prefer to jump to the results (11.93)–(11.97) – although
not easy reading, the following calculations have the virtue of demonstrating Heisenberg’s
remarkable technical ﬂuency.

11.5 The nonlinear oscillator
The classical equation of motion of a nonlinear oscillator can be written
¨x + ω2
0x + λx2 = 0 ,
(11.46)
where λx2 is the nonlinear term and λ is a small quantity. The advantage of treating this
oscillator over a purely harmonic oscillator is that the Fourier series to represent its motion
automatically contains a complete set of harmonics of the fundamental frequency ω0. The
form of Fourier series solution chosen by Heisenberg is as follows:
x = λa0 + a1 cos ωt + λa2 cos 2ωt + λ2a3 cos 3ω + · · · + λτ−1aτ cos τωt + · · · ,
(11.47)
where the coefﬁcients a0, a1, a2, . . . , aτ, . . . and ω are also expanded as power series in λ:
a0 = a(0)
0 + λa(1)
0 + λ2a(2)
0 + · · · ,
(11.48)
a1 = a(0)
1 + λa(1)
1 + λ2a(2)
1 + · · · ,
(11.49)
· · · = · · · ,
ω = ω(0) + λω(1) + λ2ω(2) + · · ·
(11.50)
The nonlinear equation (11.46) cannot be solved in general and so a perturbation solution is
sought in terms of power series in the small quantity λ. Inserting (11.47), (11.48) and (11.49)
into (11.46), the recursion formulae for values of a0, a1, a2, . . . are found by equating the
constant terms and those separately in cos ωt, cos 2ωt, cos 3ωt, . . . to zero. Ignoring terms
in λ, it is straightforward to repeat Heisenberg’s calculation and ﬁnd the following recursion
formulae for the ﬁrst few terms of the series for the classical nonlinear oscillator:

[−(3ω)2 + ω2

:

(11.51)
Heisenberg now makes the transition from classical to quantum mechanics. When x is
replaced by the x(n, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)], the ﬁrst two terms of (11.46) become
[−ω2(n, n −τ) + ω2
0]x(n, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)] .
(11.52)
The third nonlinear term in x2 has to be replaced by the quantum-theoretical multiplication
rule (11.26) and so the term becomes
λ

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′)x(n −τ ′, τ ′ −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)] .
(11.53)
Substituting (11.52) and (11.53) into (11.46), we obtain a recursion relation for the transition
amplitude x(n, n −τ),
[−ω2(n, n −τ) + ω2

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′)x(n −τ ′, τ ′ −τ) = 0 .

Once again no general solution can be found and Heisenberg carries out the same pertur-
bation analysis as for the classical case. He proposes that the translation should take the

. . .
. . .
λα−1aα(n) ←→λα−1a(n, n −α) cos ω(n, n −α)t ;
. . .
. . .
(11.55)
In his paper, Heisenberg simply writes out the result of going through exactly the same
analysis as in the classical case. Let us write down the appropriate translation to quantum
language of (11.47)–(11.50). (11.47) becomes
x = λa(n, n) + a(n, n −1) cos ω(n, n −1)t + λa(n, n −2) cos ω(n, n −2)t
+ λ2a(n, n −3) cos ω(n, n −3)t + · · · + λα−1a(n, n −α) cos ω(n, n −α)t + · · ·
(11.56)
Once again, as in (11.48)–(11.50), the a coefﬁcients and ω are expanded in a power series
in λ so that the equivalent functions are:
a(n, n) = a(0)(n, n) + λa(1)(n, n) + λ2a(2)(n, n) + · · · ,
(11.57)
a(n, n −1) = a(0)(n, n −1) + λa(1)(n, n −1) + λ2a(2)(n, n −1) + · · · ,
(11.58)
· · · = · · · ,
ω(n, n −α) = ω0(n, n −α) + λω(1)(n, n −α) + λ2ω(2)(n, n −α) + · · ·
(11.59)
Now, the same type of manipulation involved in deriving (11.51) is applied to
(11.46) and (11.56) to (11.59). In other words, recursion formulae for values of a(n, n),
a(n, n −1), a(n, n −2), . . . are found by equating the constant terms and those separately
in cos ω(n, n −1)t, cos ω(n, n −2)t, cos ω(n, n −3)t, . . . to zero. More details of the anal-
ysis are included in the paper by Aitchison et al. (2004) in which the recurrence relations for
the transition amplitudes up to second order in λ are given. Exactly as before, the recurrence
relations to zero order in λ, which Heisenberg quotes without proof, are as follows:

11.5 The nonlinear oscillator
Next, we recall that the object of the exercise is to determine the quantity x(2)(n, n −τ)
which is given by (11.26). We therefore need to relate the quantities a(n, n −τ) derived
above to the x(n, n −τ). In the classical case, xα(n) = x∗
−α(n) since x(t) is real. The
quantum theoretical analogue of this relation is
x(n, n −τ) = x∗(n −τ, n) .
(11.64)
This can be appreciated from the fact that the product of the associated exponentials
exp[iω(n, n −τ)] × exp[iω(n −τ, n)] = 1 according to the quantum rule for the addition
of frequencies. In principle, x(n, n −τ) could be a complex number, but Heisenberg
implicitly assumed that, by using the simple cosine expansion that they would the real.
Consequently,
x(n, n −τ) = x(n −τ, n) .
(11.65)
We can now compare this with the series expansion (11.56) for x(t), a typical term of
which can be written as follows:
λτ−1a(n, n −τ) cos ω(n, n −τ)t
= λτ−1
2
a(n, n −τ) {exp[iω(n, n −τ)] + exp[−iω(n, n −τ)]} .
(11.66)
Since Bohr’s frequency condition (11.9) requires ω(n, n −τ) = −ω(n −τ, n) and x(n, n −
τ) = x(n −τ, n), this expression can be rewritten
λτ−1
2
a(n, n −τ)exp[iω(n, n −τ)] + λτ−1
2
a(n −τ, n)exp[iω(n −τ, n)] . (11.67)
It is not surprising that the cosine expression corresponds to the sum of two exponentials
in the series (11.20). Equating the terms in exp[iω(n, n −τ)], it follows that
x(n, n −τ) = λτ−1
2
a(n, n −τ) .
(11.68)
Strictly speaking this equation only applies for positive values of τ. In general, the result is
x(n, n −τ) = λ|τ|−1
2
a(n, n −τ)
τ ̸= 0 .
(11.69)
The solutions of the equations of motion have been found in terms of a(n, n −τ) rather
than x(n, n −τ) and so it is convenient to use (11.69) to translate (11.40) into this notation.
Then,4

(11.70)
We can now ﬁnd the solutions for the transition amplitudes, the energies of the stationary
states and the transition frequencies. We obtain many of the key results from the lowest
order solutions in which all the λ terms are omitted. In this approximation, all the as and
ωs acquire the superscript (0), a(0) and ω(0). In this limit, (11.61) becomes
ω(0)(n, n −1) = ω0 ,

The Heisenberg breakthrough
for all n. This makes sense since, if the perturbation term in λ is zero, the nonlinear
oscillator becomes a linear oscillator with angular frequency ω0. Now we use (11.71) to
replace ω(0)(n, n + 1) and ω(0)(n, n −1) in (11.70). Then,
h
πmω0
= [a(0)(n, n + 1)]2 −[a(0)(n, n −1)]2 .
(11.72)
By inspection, we see that the solution of this difference equation is
[a(0)(n, n −1)]2 =
h
πmω0
(n + constant) .
(11.73)
The value of the constant is found from Heisenberg’s argument that there should be no
transitions from the ground state to lower states, that is,
[a(0)(0, −1)]2 = 0 .
(11.74)
Consequently, the constant is zero. The solution for a(0)(n, n −1) can therefore be written
a(0)(n, n −1) = β√n
where
β = (h/πmω0)1/2 .
(11.75)
We now repeat the procedure for (11.60):
a(0)(n, n) = −1
4ω2
0
9
[a(0)(n + 1, n)]2 + [a(0)(n, n −1)]2:
,
(11.76)
and so using (11.75),
a(0)(n, n) = −β
4ω2
0
(2n + 1) .
(11.77)
Next, we repeat the procedure for (11.62). Then,

:
a(0)(n, n −2) + 1
2a(0)(n, n −1) a(0)(n −1, n −2) = 0 .
(11.78)
The frequency ω(0)(n, n −2) must obey the frequency composition rule
ω(0)(n, n −2) = ω(0)(n, n −1) + ω(0)(n −1, n −2) ,
(11.79)
and since, ω(0)(n, n −1) = ω0 for all n, ω(0)(n, n −2) = 2ω0. In fact, it is obvious from
the frequency combination rule that repeated application gives the result
ω(0)(n, n −τ) = τω0 .
(11.80)
This result again makes a lot of sense. The harmonics of the nonlinear oscillator are simply
integral multiples of the fundamental frequency ω0 in the lowest approximation.
It is straightforward to show, by the same reasoning which led to (11.75) and (11.77),
that
a(0)(n, n −3) =
β3
48ω4

11.5 The nonlinear oscillator
The ﬁnal task is to work out the energies of the stationary states of the oscillator.
Heisenberg begins with the classical expression for the energy of a nonlinear oscillator.
Following the usual procedure, we multiply (11.46) by m ˙x and integrate with respect to
time with the result
W = 1
2m ˙x2 + 1
2mω2
0x2 + 1
3λmx3 .
(11.83)
He then quotes the answers according to classical and quantum physics without explaining
how they are obtained. Aitchison and his colleagues conjecture entirely plausibly that he
reasoned as follows. Heisenberg now had a formalism for taking products of transition
amplitudes, (11.25) and (11.26), which are repeated here for convenience:

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ ′)t] exp[iω(n −τ ′, n −τ)t]
=

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ)

exp[iω(n, n −τ)t] .
(11.84)
Therefore, x2 is represented by

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ)

exp[iω(n, n −τ)t] .
(11.85)
Correspondingly, ˙x2 can be replaced by the product

τ ′
iω(n, n −τ ′)x(n, n −τ ′)iω(n −τ ′, n −τ) x(n −τ ′, n −τ)
× exp[iω(n, n −τ ′)t] exp[iω(n −τ ′, n −τ)t]
=

τ ′
ω(n, n −τ ′)ω(n −τ, n −τ ′)x(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)t] ,
(11.86)
where we have used the relation ω(n, m) = −ω(m, n), according to Bohr’s frequency rela-
tion. Thus, the expression for the energy of the nonlinear oscillator is of the form
W = W(n, n −τ) exp[iω(n, n −τ)t]) .
(11.87)
Heisenberg fully appreciated the fact that energy will only be conserved if W is time-
independent, meaning that the terms in which τ ̸= 0 must be zero,
W(n, n −τ) = 0,
if
τ ̸= 0 .
(11.88)
This provided a key test of the validity of the new quantum formalism.
Let us ﬁrst evaluate W given the requirement (11.88). We are interested in the lowest order
solutions and so we can neglect terms in λ and its higher powers. Therefore, we can neglect
the term in 1
3λmx3 in the expression for the total energy. Likewise, in the expansion (11.56),
the only terms which do not depend upon λ are those in a(n, n −1) cos ω(n, n −1)t, in
other words, transitions in which n changes only by one. Therefore, the only terms which
survive in (11.87) are those in W(n, n), W(n, n −2) and W(n, n + 2). In fact, Aitchison
and his colleagues show that W(n, n −2) and W(n, n + 2) both sum to zero and so the

To ﬁnd the total energy, we sum over the only surviving terms in τ ′, τ ′ = ±1. The ωs can
now be awarded superscripts (0) since all terms in λ and its higher orders are omitted in the
lowest order. Therefore,
W = 1

(11.90)
From (11.65), x(n, n + 1) = x(n + 1, n) and we can now replace the xs by the a(0)s
according to (11.69). Also, because the transitions are all equally spaced in frequency,
ω(0)(n, n −1) = ω(0)(n, n + 1) = ω0. Therefore,

and
a(0)(n + 1, n) = β

Heisenberg immediately notes that this expression for the energy of the harmonic oscillator
differs from the ‘classical’ result W = nhω0/2π because of the inclusion of what is now
referred to as the ‘zero point energy’ 1
2hω0/2π.
The above analysis is only to zero-order in the small parameter λ. Heisenberg does not
proceed to evaluate the higher order corrections of the nonlinear oscillator (11.46), but
rather treats the simpler example
¨x + ω2
0x + λx3 = 0 ,

11.6 The simple rotator
He also makes the important parenthetical remark,
‘(I could not prove in general that all periodic terms actually vanish, but this was the case
for all terms evaluated)’
but gives no details about which terms he tested. As discussed in the context of (11.87) and
(11.88), a key requirement of the theory is to ensure that energy is conserved. Aitchison
and his colleagues (2004) demonstrate in Appendix B of their paper how these calculations
can be performed using Heisenberg’s approach and demonstrate that up to order λ the terms
W(n, n −α) are indeed zero, if α ̸= 0. They also carry out the equivalent analysis which
led to (11.96) for the case analysed by Heisenberg with the nonlinear term λx2 and ﬁnd the

Using Kramer’s and Heisenberg’s version of Born’s correspondence rule, this expression
translates into
h = 2πm[a2ω(n + 1, n) −a2ω(n, n −1)] .
(11.100)
Just as in the case of the nonlinear oscillator, the solution by inspection is
ω(n, n −1) = h(n + constant)
2πma2
.
(11.101)
Again, since there should be no amplitude for transitions from the ground state to lower
states, the constant is zero and so
ω(n, n −1) =
hn

The energy of the electron is W = 1

The Heisenberg breakthrough
As Heisenberg points out, this expression again satisﬁes the condition ω(n, n −1) =
(2π/h)[W(n) −W(n −1)]. This result can also be written in the suggestive form
W =

(11.104)
where I = ma2 is the moment of inertia of the electron in its orbit about the nucleus.5
The importance of this calculation for Heisenberg was that the expression (11.104) was
in excellent agreement with the band spectra measured by Adolf Kratzer (1922). Kratzer
had made a detailed analysis of the cyanide spectroscopic bands and found that he had to
introduce half-integral quantum numbers to account for details of these rotational spectra.
Heisenberg fully appreciated that his new quantum formalism automatically resulted in
half-integral quantisation.
The last paragraph of Heisenberg’s paper reads as follows:
‘Whether a method to determine quantum-theoretical data using relations between observ-
able quantities, such as that proposed here, can be regarded as satisfactory in principle, or
whether this method after all represents far too rough an approach to the physical problem
of constructing a theoretical quantum mechanics, an obviously very involved problem at
the moment, can be decided only by a more intensive mathematical investigation of the
method which has been very superﬁcially employed here.’
11.7 Reflections
Heisenberg’s caution in his concluding paragraph contrasts dramatically with its revolu-
tionary content. As we will see, the theory was rapidly taken up by the leading theorists and
converted into much more accessible form. There can be no doubt that Born fully appre-
ciated the importance of what Heisenberg had achieved and made the correct decision to
forward it to the Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik for immediate publication as soon as he had studied
it in detail.
Heisenberg was not happy with the paper, which contrasted with his previous papers
in which well-posed problems were solved using established mathematical procedures. In
his discussions with Pauli, he considered the ‘positive’ part of the paper to be ‘poor’. As
remarked by Mehra and Rechenberg (1982b)
‘Now, instead of a complete formulation of a consistent atomic theory, the future quantum
mechanics, Heisenberg felt that he was able to present only a step in formulating its
foundations, but by no means the ﬁnal solution. . . . He had just been able to write down
a few formal equations, which were difﬁcult to handle mathematically and even more
difﬁcult to interpret physically.’
What is staggering about the paper is how many ideas were to prove to be absolutely
correct. Let us review these achievements.

11.7 Reflections
1. By far the most signiﬁcant and original idea was the concept that what had gone wrong
with the old quantum theory was its kinematical content.
2. This concept was coupled with the innovation that the quantum theory had to be written
in terms of the properties of atomic systems which were measurable.
3. This led to the concept, modelled on classical electromagnetism, that the spatial co-
ordinates were to be replaced by ‘transition amplitudes’, the squares of which would
determine the probability of such transitions taking place.
4. Guided by the correspondence principle, the product law for the transition amplitudes
was found to be non-commutative.
5. In application to the speciﬁc problems which could be treated with his new formalism,
the quantum expression for the energy levels of an oscillator and a simple rotator had a
‘zero-point energy’ of hν/2.
6. In contrast to the kinematics, which was changed radically, the dynamics of particles
and oscillators remained ‘Newtonian’.
7. As pointed out by Aitchison and his colleagues (2004), many of the results derived by
Heisenberg have their exact analogues in the completed version of quantum mechanics.
For example, (11.54) illustrates a basic rule of quantum mechanics that a transition
amplitude for a transition from one state to another is found by summing over all
possible intermediate states.
Despite its problems, Heisenberg’s paper is undoubtedly one of the great papers in
theoretical physics. Almost immediately, it opened up routes to more powerful mathematical
approaches. Heisenberg could only have achieved so much under the joint inﬂuences of the
intuitive approach of Bohr and the more mathematical approaches of Born and Sommerfeld.

Matrix mechanics
12.1 Born’s reaction
In his reminiscences, Born recounted his memories of these exciting days (Born, 1978):
‘Meanwhile Heisenberg pursued some work of his own, keeping its idea and purpose
somewhat dark and mysterious. Towards the end of the summer semester, in the ﬁrst days
of July 1925, he came to me with a manuscript and asked me to read it and decide whether
it was worth publishing . . . He added that though he had tried hard, he could not make any
progress beyond the simple considerations contained in his paper, and he asked me to try
myself, which I promised . . .
His most audacious step consists in the suggestion of introducing the transition ampli-
tudes of the coordinates q and momenta p in the formulae of mechanics . . .
I was most impressed by Heisenberg’s considerations, which were a great step forward
in the programme which we had pursued . . .
After having sent Heisenberg’s paper to Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik for publication, I began to
ponder about his symbolic multiplication, and was soon so involved in it that I thought the
whole day and could hardly sleep at night. For there was something fundamental behind
it . . . And one morning . . . I suddenly saw the light: Heisenberg’s symbolic multiplication
was nothing but matrix calculus, well known to me since my student days from the lectures
of Rosanes at Breslau.’
At that time, matrices and matrix algebra were regarded as the province of the math-
ematicians and there were few examples of their application in physics. Heisenberg was
certainly unaware of matrices, as he himself confessed. In fact, Born was one of the few
physicists who had used matrices in his earlier researches with von K´arm´an on the theory of
crystal lattices (Born and von K´arm´an, 1912). He had therefore been familiar with matrix
algebra, with inﬁnite matrices and the techniques of transforming inﬁnite quadratic forms
to principal axes. Born had moved away from these pursuits, but now he recalled his earlier
activities.
What Born recognised was that Heisenberg’s new multiplication rule (11.26) for transition
amplitudes corresponded to the multiplication rule for matrices, namely,
x(2)(n, n −τ) =

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ) .
(12.1)
In addition, it was well known that the multiplication rule for matrices is non-commutative,
exactly the feature of his scheme which had caused Heisenberg so much concern. What
Born did was to change slightly Heisenberg’s notation, by setting the transition amplitude

12.1 Born’s reaction
q(n, n + τ) ≡q(n, m) and then regarding q(n, m) as the elements of a matrix q. Then,
when the matrix product pq of two matrices p and q is taken, it is not necessarily equal to
qp.
The calculation which Born carried out can be appreciated from Heisenberg’s product
rule (11.28) for the product of two transition amplitudes x(n, n −τ) and y(n, n −τ):
x(n, n −τ) y(n, n −τ) eiω(n,n−τ)t ≡

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) y(n −τ ′, n −τ) eiω(n,n−τ)t . (12.2)
Born immediately made the signiﬁcant step of deﬁning a quantised ‘momentum amplitude’
through the deﬁnition
p ≡p(n, n −τ) = m ˙x(n, n −τ) ,
(12.3)
by analogy with Heisenberg’s transition amplitudes. Thus, if x = x(n, n −τ) =

τ x(n, n −τ) eiω(n,n−τ)t, then
p = m ˙x(n, n −τ) = m

τ
x(n, n −τ) iω(n, n −τ) eiω(n,n−τ)t .
(12.4)
In so doing, Born had immediately introduced the pair of canonically conjugate space and
momentum variables in their quantum guise, p and q. Therefore, using the rule (12.2), the
product px is given by
px = m

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) iω(n, n −τ ′) eiω(n,n−τ ′)tx(n −τ ′, n −τ) eiω(n−τ ′,n−τ)t
(12.5)
= m

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) iω(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n −τ) eiω(n,n−τ)t ,
(12.6)
where 
τ ′ means ‘take the sum over all integral values of τ ′ from −∞to +∞’. Now, let
us evaluate this sum for the case τ = 0, corresponding to the time-invariant value of the
product of p and q and to the diagonal elements of the matrix product. Then,
px = m

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) iω(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n) ,
(12.7)
and so,
px −xp = m

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) iω(n, n −τ ′) x(n −τ ′, n)
−m

τ ′
x(n, n −τ ′) iω(n −τ ′, n) x(n −τ ′, n) .
(12.8)
We now use the rules ω(n, n −τ ′) = −ω(n −τ ′, n) from Bohr’s frequency condition and
x(n, n −τ ′) = x∗(n, n −τ ′) because the x should be real. Let us ﬁrst sum over all values
of τ ′ > 0. Then, (12.8) becomes
px −xp = 2mi

τ ′>0
ω(n, n −τ ′) |x(n −τ ′, n)|2 .

Matrix mechanics
We obtain a similar result if we sum over all values of τ ′ < 0, but let us now write
τ ′ = −τ ′(+), where the τ ′(+) are positive integers. Then,
px −xp = 2mi

τ ′<0
ω(n, n −τ ′) |x(n −τ ′, n)|2
=

τ ′(+)>0
ω(n, n + τ ′(+)) |x(n + τ ′(+), n)|2 .
(12.10)
Combining (12.9) and (12.10), we evidently obtain the result
px −xp = 2mi

τ ′>0

ω(n, n −τ ′) |x(n −τ ′, n)|2 −ω(n + τ ′, n) |x(n + τ ′, n)|2
.
(12.11)
This expression can now be compared with Heisenberg’s quantum relation (11.40),
h = 4πm
+∞

0

|x(n, n + τ)|2ω(n, n + τ) −|x(n, n −τ)|2ω(n, n −τ)

.
(12.12)
It immediately follows that
px −xp =
h
2πi .
(12.13)
Born appreciated the deep signiﬁcance of this result – the non-commutativity of the prod-
uct px −xp was directly related to quantum processes at the atomic level through the
appearance of Planck’s constant in (12.13).
He was well aware of the fact that the rule (12.13) only applied to the diagonal elements
of the matrix product, but he guessed that all the off-diagonal terms had to be zero. Then,
the non-commutativity rule could be written
px −xp =
h
2πiI ,
(12.14)
where I is the unit matrix, but he was unable prove this conjecture. He needed help.
12.2 Born and Jordan’s matrix mechanics
Born’s ﬁrst reaction was to ask Pauli to collaborate with him in developing the mathematical
physics of matrix algebra as applied to quantum mechanics, but Pauli was dismissive of
the suggestion – he did not believe in non-commutativity and preferred to let Heisenberg
continue the line of research he had pioneered. He was also opposed to Born’s formal
mathematical approach to quantum physics. He told Born
‘Yes, I know, you are fond of tedious and complicated formalisms. You will spoil Heisen-
berg’s physical ideas by your futile mathematics.’
Instead, Born turned to Pascual Jordan, another remarkably talented product of the
G¨ottingen school of mathematical physics. Jordan had attended Courant’s
courses on

mathematics and had assisted him in the preparation of his classic text with Hilbert The
Methods of Mathematical Physics (Courant and Hilbert, 1924). As a result of this work, he
had some familiarity with the theory of matrices, although he did not claim any particular
speciality in the ﬁeld. He had already helped Born in the preparation of his review of
the dynamics of crystal lattices (Born, 1923) and written a paper with Born in which
van Vleck’s theory of dispersion was extended to aperiodic motions (Born and Jordan,
1925b). He immediately took up Born’s challenge and within a few days proved Born’s
conjecture concerning the non-commutativity of (12.14) using matrix methods. Born and
Jordan now took up the challenge of attempting to work out a fully self-consistent system
of quantum mechanics using matrix methods. Born was exhausted and suffered a minor
breakdown during the succeeding month and so much of the analysis was carried out by
Jordan alone. In a remarkably short space of time, they made huge progress towards the ﬁrst
complete exposition of quantum mechanics using matrix methods. Their important paper
was submitted only 60 days after Heisenberg’s (Born and Jordan, 1925b).
Their agenda is clearly set out in the introduction to their paper
‘. . . it is in fact possible, starting with the basic premises given by Heisenberg, to build
up a closed theory of quantum mechanics which displays strikingly close analogies with
classical mechanics, but at the same time preserves characteristic features of quantum
phenomena.’
Born’s objective was to rewrite all the equations of classical physics in matrix notation
so that the key concept of non-commutativity would automatically be incorporated in the
new quantum mechanics. Let us review the remarkable contents of Born and Jordan’s
paper.
12.2.1 Matrix algebra
Matrices and matrix algebra had been highly developed by the mathematicians but had, as
yet, found few applications in mathematical physics. They appear in Chapter 1 of Courant
and Hilbert’s The Methods of Mathematical Physics and in Bˆocher’s Algebra (Bˆocher,
1911), which were consulted by Jordan.1 In Chap. 1 of Born and Jordan’s paper, the
elementary operations of matrix calculations were reviewed. We recall only the essential
features of these calculations, emphasising how Born and Jordan had to develop the standard
procedures.
First, they used a slightly different notation from the usual use of sufﬁces to identify the
matrix elements, the objective being to make the notation similar to that used by Heisenberg,
so that, as noted above x(n, n −τ) ≡x(n, m). We will adopt the following notation:
a = [a(nm)] =
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
a(00)

Then the standard texts show how many of the operations are similar to those of ordinary
algebra, an important exception being the rule for matrix multiplication. Thus,

Matrix mechanics
r The equality of two matrices:
a = b
means
a(nm) = b(nm) .
(12.16)
r Matrix addition:
a = b + c
means
a(nm) = b(nm) + c(nm) .
(12.17)
r Matrix multiplication:
a = bc
means
a(nm) =
k=∞

k=0
b(nk)c(km) .
(12.18)
This is the rule Born recognised in Heisenberg’s new multiplication rule for transition
amplitudes. Powers are deﬁned by repeated matrix multiplication.
r The associative rule for matrix multiplication and the distributive rule for combined
matrix multiplication and addition are
(ab)c = a(bc) ;
(12.19)
a(b + c) = ab + ac .
(12.20)
r Non-commutativity of matrix multiplication means that, in general,
ab ̸= ba .
(12.21)
If it turns out that ab = ba, the matrices a and b are said to commute.
r The unit matrix I is deﬁned by
I ≡[δ(n, m)]
δ(n, m) = 0
if n ̸= m
δ(n, n) = 1
if n = m .
(12.22)
It follows that
aI = Ia = a .
(12.23)
r The reciprocal matrix is deﬁned by
a−1a = aa−1 = I ,
(12.24)
provided the determinant of a is not zero. As shown in the standard textbooks, the
elements of a−1 are found by forming the adjoint matrix (adj a), the elements of which
are the transposed cofactors of a(nm). Then, a(adj a) = (adj a)a = |a|I.

functions of a parameter t, then differentiation of an element of the product ab is given

12.2 Born and Jordan’s matrix mechanics
Note the importance of the order of the differentiations because of the non-commutativity
of the matrix product.
r Repeated application of (12.26) results in the following rule
d
dt (x1x2 . . . xn) = ˙x1x2 . . . xn + x1˙x2 . . . xn + · · · + x1x2 . . . ˙xn .
(12.27)
r Finally, we can deﬁne functions of matrices, for example,
f1(y1, . . . ym; x1, . . . xn) = 0 ,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
(12.28)
fn(y1, . . . ym; x1, . . . xn) = 0 .
These results were all in the literature and they were quickly used by Jordan to demonstrate
the correctness of Born’s conjecture (12.14). For the case of the one-dimensional nonlinear
harmonic oscillator, Jordan rewrote the equation of motion as follows:
¨q + ω2
0q + λqn = 0 ,
n = 2, 3 . . .
(12.29)
Multiplying (12.29) by mq, ﬁrst from the right, then from the left and subtracting these
matrix relations, Jordan found the result
m (¨qq −q¨q) = 0 ,
(12.30)
where 0 is the inﬁnite zero matrix. We now use (12.26) to write
m d(˙qq)
dt
= m d˙q
dt q + m ˙q˙q = m ¨qq + m ˙q2 .
(12.31)
Similarly,
m d(q˙q)
dt
= m ˙q2 + mq¨q .
(12.32)
Substituting (12.31) and (12.32) into (12.30), we ﬁnd
m d
dt (˙qq −q˙q) = 0 .
(12.33)
Finally, in the spirit of Born’s extension of the concept of transition amplitudes to momenta,
we write p = m ˙q, and so
d
dt (pq −qp) = 0 .
(12.34)
Now, the off-diagonal terms of the product matrices pq and qp all contain exponential
time-varying terms of the form exp[(2πi/h) × (En −Em)t] where En and Em are the
energies of the stationary states n and m and so the only way in which (12.34) can be
satisﬁed is if the off-diagonal terms are all zero. This result, and the speed with which
Jordan obtained it, greatly pleased Born. They agreed to develop the full theory of matrix
mechanics collaboratively.
As remarked by Jammer (1989),
‘The equations of motion have shown that (pq −qp) is a diagonal matrix. That all
diagonal elements are equal to h/2πi has been a consequence of the correspondence

principle. Moreover, since [(12.14)], as Born soon realised, is the only fundamental
equation in which h appears, the introduction of Planck’s constant into quantum mechanics
has likewise been a consequence of the correspondence principle.’
Reﬂecting on these calculations, Born (1978) later remarked,
‘I shall never forget the thrill I experienced when I succeeded in condensing Heisenberg’s
ideas on quantum conditions into the mysterious equation (pq −qp) = (h/2πi)I.’
12.2.2 Matrix dynamics
With these new insights, Born and Jordan set about rewriting the laws of dynamics in matrix
form. While the results obtained above could be obtained from the standard textbooks, the
next steps involved the development of a formalism corresponding to the differentiation
of one matrix with respect to another. Again, care has to be taken since the variables do
not commute under matrix multiplication. Therefore, each matrix product has to be written
out and the correct order of differentiation preserved. For example, if y, x1, x2 and x3 are
matrices and if, say,
y = x2
1x2x1x3,
then
∂y
∂x1
= x1x2x1x3 + x2x1x3x1 + x3x2
1x2 ,
(12.35)
where we have used the permutation rule that x1x1x2x1x3 = x1x2x1x3x1 = x1x3x2
1x2 to
bring each x1 to the front of the queue for differentiation. These and further rules for matrix
manipulation completed Sect. 2 of Chap. 1 of Born and Jordan’s paper.
Chapter 2 introduces the laws of dynamics in matrix form. Immediately, they state that
the dynamical system is to be deﬁned by a spatial coordinate q and momentum p according
to the deﬁnitions
q =

q(nm) e2πi ν(nm)t
,
p =

p(nm) e2πi ν(nm)t
.
(12.36)
Whereas Heisenberg had developed his arguments starting from Newton’s laws of motion,
Born and Jordan replaced these by the more powerful methods of Hamiltonian dynamics
which had considerable success in the old quantum theory. Like Heisenberg, they only
considered systems of one degree of freedom, one of their intentions being to demonstrate
that this more rigorous formal approach could reproduce Heisenberg’s results and so create
a formally self-consistent theory of quantum mechanics in which the dynamical entities
were matrices.
Immediately, they noted that, in general, the q(nm) and p(nm) are complex numbers.
As a result, these matrices must be Hermitian matrices in which, on transposition, each
element goes over into its complex conjugate. As a result, it follows that
q(nm) q(mn) = |q(nm)|2
and
ν(nm) = −ν(mn) .
(12.37)
Then, in the case of Cartesian coordinates, they identiﬁed |q(nm)|2 as a measure of the
probability of the transitions n ↔m.
Next, they translated the Hamiltonian equations of classical mechanics, which we dis-
cussed in Sect. 5.4.3, into matrix form. The Hamiltonian (5.64) can be written in matrix

form as
H = 1
2m p2 + U(q) .
(12.38)
Then, the equations of motion can be written in canonical form
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
˙q = ∂H
∂p ,
˙p = −∂H
∂q .
(12.39)
They then showed that this formulation leads back to Heisenberg’s quantisation rule (11.40)
and to the Thomas–Kuhn expression (10.34).
Having set out the basic elements of matrix mechanics, Born and Jordan next state,
‘The content of the previous paragraphs furnishes the basic rules of the new quantum
mechanics in their entirely. All other laws of quantum mechanics, whose general validity
is to be veriﬁed, must be derivable from these basic tenets. As instances of such laws to
be proved, the law of conservation of energy and the Bohr frequency condition primarily
enter into consideration.’
The law of conservation of energy requires that ˙H = 0 and consequently, as we have shown,
the Hamiltonian matrix H must be diagonal. Then, Heisenberg identiﬁed the diagonal
elements H(nn) as the energies of the stationary states with quantum number n and so
Bohr’s frequency condition followed immediately:
hν(nm) = H(nn) −H(mm) ,
(12.40)
and the energy of the nth state is
Wn = H(nn) + constant .
(12.41)
Born and Jordan show formally how this comes about.
Chapter 3 of their paper concerns the application of their new approach to harmonic and
anharmonic oscillators, the intention being to derive Heisenberg’s result with the new matrix
formalism. Sufﬁce to say that they succeeded, but without the need to introduce some of the
assumptions made by Heisenberg. For example, Heisenberg had implicitly assumed that
transitions only occurred between neighbouring states, whereas the new formalism required
the quantum transitions to correspond to changes of quantum number n = ±1. The ﬁnal
Chap. 4 of their paper concerned an early application of these concepts to electromagnetic
radiation. A signiﬁcant feature of this last section was the demonstration that the squares
of the amplitudes of the matrix elements representing the dipole moment of the transition
determine the transition probabilities.
As already noted, Born was recovering from exhaustion during the elaboration of these
concepts and, whilst he was the instigator of the programme and introduced the concepts
of the matrix multiplication rule and the basic quantum relation (12.14), the detailed
elaboration of the rules of matrix mechanics and dynamics was largely Jordan’s work. Once
the paper was submitted, the collaboration with Heisenberg resumed and resulted in the
deﬁnitive paper describing the full theory of matrix mechanics by Born, Heisenberg and
Jordan (1926).

Matrix mechanics
12.3 Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926) – the Three-Man Paper
It is remarkable that the ‘Three-Man Paper’ ended up being as coherent as it did since
there was actually remarkably little face-to-face contact between the three authors. After
the completion of his revolutionary paper of 1925, Heisenberg spent nearly a month and a
half in Munich and a walking tour in the Alps. Then, rather than return to G¨ottingen, he
went back to Copenhagen and only returned to G¨ottingen in late October. Born returned to
G¨ottingen following his period of recuperation and then departed for his trip as a ‘foreign
lecturer’ to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on 31 August 1926. Thus, much of
the work on the paper, which was received for publication by the Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik
on 15 November 1926, was carried out by correspondence. Equally remarkable is the fact
that this long paper On quantum mechanics II was a remarkably complete exposition of
the theory of matrix mechanics as applied to quantum physics and dealt with many of the
incompletenesses of Heisenberg’s and Born and Jordan’s earlier papers (Born et al., 1926).
The fact that the theory was developed so rapidly can be attributed to a number of factors.
Although Heisenberg confessed that he had not appreciated that non-commutativity is a
key feature of the mathematics of matrices, as soon as he heard of Born and Jordan’s
successes, he was an instant convert and quickly learned and applied these tools to the
various problems he had worked on. Born and Jordan were delighted that he joined their
collaboration since he brought to the research quite different skills and approaches to those
of Born and Jordan. The second feature of the collaboration was that all three were experts
in the classical theory of multiply periodic systems, the perturbation schemes used and the
theory of canonical transformations. These classical techniques now had to be translated
into the language of matrix mechanics. The third piece of good fortune was that the
theory of inﬁnite quadratic forms had been developed by Hilbert, Born’s teacher, 20 years
earlier. Born not only had a deep understanding of these methods, but also realised that
the matrix theory of canonical transformations was identical with the theory of principal-
axes transformations which would turn out to be the route to the calculation of the energy
levels in atomic systems. A further bonus was that Hilbert’s formalism, as extended by
Ernst Hellinger, enabled discrete and continuous states of atomic systems to be treated in
a uniﬁed manner.
Mehra and Rechenberg provide a succinct summary of the achievements of the Three-
Man Paper:
‘The endeavours of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan led to the development of the theory
of matrix mechanics, which was applicable to all types of multiply periodic systems,
to non-degenerate and degenerate ones, and in principle even to aperiodic systems. In
addition, the authors realised that the matrix equations had a simpler structure than
the corresponding classical equations. Thus, for example, the set of Hamilton–Jacobi
partial differential equations of classical mechanics was replaced by a set of algebraic
equations; their solution established a unitary transformation of the quantum-mechanical
Hamiltonian matrix to a diagonal matrix. Now the discussion of conservation laws also
appeared to be considerably more elementary.’ (Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982c)

12.3 The Three-Man Paper
As discussed by van der Waerden (1967) and Mehra and Rechenberg (1982c), the ideas
were developed in a ﬂurry of correspondence between the three authors, as well as with
Pauli and Bohr. Let us give some impression of the contents of the ‘ﬁnal’ version of matrix
mechanics.
12.3.1 Basic theory – systems with one degree of freedom
The introduction was written by Heisenberg and he immediately summarised the advances
since his own paper (Heisenberg, 1925) and Born and Jordan’s Paper I (Born and Jordan,
1925b):
‘The present paper sets out to develop further a general quantum-theoretical mechanics
whose physical and mathematical basis has been treated in two previous papers by the
present authors. It was found possible to extend the above theory to systems having several
degrees of freedom (Chapter 2), and by the introduction of “canonical transformations”
to reduce the problem of integrating the equations of motion to a known mathematical
formulation. From this theory of canonical transformations we are able to derive a per-
turbation theory (Chapter 1, §4) which displays close similarity to classical perturbation
theory. On the other hand we were able to trace a connection between quantum mechan-
ics and the highly-developed mathematical theory of quadratic forms of inﬁnitely many
variables (Chapter 3).’
But, they recognised that the new quantum mechanics is not visualisable as was the old
quantum theory:
‘Admittedly, such a system of quantum-theoretical relations between observable quanti-
ties, when compared with the quantum theory employed hitherto, would labour under the
disadvantage of not being directly amenable to a geometrically visualizable interpretation,
since the motions of the electrons cannot be described in terms of the familiar concepts
of space and time.’
Despite this,
‘If one reviews the fundamental differences between classical and quantum theory, dif-
ferences which stem from the basic quantum theoretical postulates, then the formalism
proposed . . . , if proved to be correct, would appear to represent a system of quantum
mechanics as close to that of classical theory as could reasonably be hoped.’
Chapter 1 begins by setting out the basic formalism of matrix calculus for systems having
one degree of freedom and re-introducing Born’s equation (12.14),
px −xp =
h
2πiI .
(12.42)
They remark on the fact that this
‘. . . is the only one of the basic formulae in the quantum mechanics proposed here which
contains Planck’s constant h. It is satisfying that the constant h already enters into the
basic tenets of the theory at this stage in so simple a form.’

Matrix mechanics
This basic relation leads to a more general expression. They show that, if f(pq) is any
function of p and q, then
fq −qf = ∂f
∂p
h
2πi ,
(12.43)
pf −fp = ∂f
∂q
h
2πi .
(12.44)
They demonstrate this by showing that if the formulae (12.43) and (12.44) are valid for
each of the functions ϕ and ψ, then they must also be valid for the combinations ϕ + ψ
and ϕ · ψ. The ﬁrst of these is trivial, while the second follows from a simple calculation.
Setting f = ϕ · ψ, (12.43) becomes
(ϕ · ψ)q −q(ϕ · ψ) = ϕ(ψq −qψ) + (ϕq −qϕ)ψ
=

ϕ ∂ψ
∂p + ∂ϕ
∂p ψ
 h
2πi = ∂(ϕ · ψ)
∂p
h
2πi .
(12.45)
A similar treatment follows for p(ϕ · ψ) −(ϕ · ψ)p in (12.44). Therefore, since (12.43)
and (12.44) hold for p and q they must also be valid for every function f which can be
expressed as a power series in p and q.
Next, the canonical equations (12.39) are introduced and energy conservation and Bohr’s
frequency condition derived from the basic postulates. Central to the development is the
frequency combination principle according to which
ν(nm) + ν(mk) = ν(nk) ,
(12.46)
which leads to the expression
ν(nm) = (Wn −Wm)
h
,
(12.47)
where the Wns are the energy levels or ‘energy terms’. These can be converted into a
diagonal matrix W according to the deﬁnition
W = [W(nm)] = [δnm Wn] =

Wn for n = m ,
0 for n ̸= m .
(12.48)
Now, for any quantum theoretical matrix a, the elements of the matrix take the form
a = [a(nm) e2πi ν(nm)t] ,
(12.49)
and so the time derivative of a is
˙a = [2πi ν(nm) a(nm)] ,
(12.50)
where the exponential time dependence has been dropped since it cancels through all the
formulae. We can now use (12.48) to write the energy terms as follows:
Wa =

k
W(nk) a(km)

=

k
δnk Wk a(km)

= [Wn a(nm)] ,

12.3 The Three-Man Paper
Inserting these relations into (12.47) and (12.50), we ﬁnd the general result for any quantum
theoretical quantity a,
˙a = 2πi
h (Wa −aW) .
(12.53)
Next, we need to show that this formalism is consistent with Hamilton’s equations in
matrix form. In (12.53), we set successively a = q and a = p and substitute for ˙q and ˙P
in (12.39). Then, we use (12.43) and (12.44) with f = H to determine ∂H/∂q and ∂H/∂p.
The result is the pair of equations
Wq −qW = Hq −qH
;
Wp −PW = Hp −PH ,
(12.54)
which can be rewritten
(W −H)q −q(W −H) = 0
;
(W −H)p −p(W −H) = 0 .
(12.55)
Thus, (W −H) commutes with p and q and hence with every other function of (p, q). In
particular, it commutes with the energy function, or Hamiltonian, H,
(W −H)H −H(W −H) = 0 .
(12.56)
Hence, from (12.53), we ﬁnd
˙H = 0 .
(12.57)
This result proves that energy is conserved and that H is a diagonal matrix, H(nm) = δnm Hn.
Consequently, from the ﬁrst expression in (12.54),
q(nm)(Hn −Hm) = q(nm)(Wn −Wm)
;
(Hn −Hm)
h
= ν(nm) .
(12.58)
Now, Born and his colleagues invert the argument with important consequences for
the further development of the theory. If now they assume energy conservation and the
frequency condition (12.58) and that the energy function H is an analytic function of
variables P and Q, then provided
PQ −QP =
h
2πiI ,
(12.59)
the canonical equations
˙Q = ∂H
∂P
,
˙P = −∂H
∂Q
(12.60)
always apply. This leads naturally to one of the most important features of their scheme
of quantum mechanics, the concept of canonical transformations. The above arguments
suggest that a canonical transformation from variables (P, Q) to (p, q) can be written
pq −qp = PQ −QP =
h
2πiI .
(12.61)
Heisenberg and Born both worked on the nature of the transformations from variables
(P, Q) to (p, q). Born’s knowledge of matrix algebra enabled him to come up with the most

Matrix mechanics
general form of transformation which was of the form
P = SpS−1 ,
Q = SqS−1 .
(12.62)
By the same reasoning as above, these transformations must also hold good for sums and
products of p and q and so more generally,
f(P, Q) = Sf(p, q)S−1 .
(12.63)
The importance of this result is most simply explained in the authors’ own words:
‘The importance of the canonical transformation is due to the following theorem: If any
pair of values p0, q0 be given which satisfy [(12.60)], then the problem of integrating the
canonical equations for the energy function H(p, q) can be reduced to the following: A
function S is to be determined, such that when
p = Sp0S−1 ,
q = Sq0S−1 ,
(12.64)
the function
H(p, q) = SH(p0, q0)S−1 = W ,
(12.65)
becomes a diagonal matrix. Equation [(12.65)] is the analogue to the Hamilton partial
differential equation, and in a sense stands for the action function.’
This is the key result – the diagonal elements of the matrix W are the stationary energy terms
of the system. The problem has been reduced to the determination of the transformation of
H(p, q) to diagonal form and the procedures for doing this were already in the mathematical
literature. The remainder of Chap. 1 of their paper was devoted to showing how the new
formalism could deal with perturbation theory and time-variability of the energy function
H.
12.3.2 Systems with an arbitrary number of degree
of freedom and Hermitian forms
The second chapter deals with the extension of the formalism to several degrees of freedom,
f > 1 and involves replacing the two-dimensional matrices by 2 f -dimensional matrices
corresponding to the 2 f -dimensional manifold of stationary states:
qk = [qk(n1 . . . nk, m1 . . . m f )]
,
pk = [pk(n1 . . . nk, m1 . . . m f )].
(12.66)
The equations of motion corresponding to (12.39) can be taken over in the form
˙qk = ∂H
∂p k
; ˙pk = −∂H
∂q k
.
(12.67)
In addition, the commutation relations have to be extended as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
pkql −qlpk =
h
2πiδkl ,
pkpl −plpk = 0 ,
qkql −qlqk = 0 .

12.3 The Three-Man Paper
They demonstrated how all the results described in Sect. 12.3.1 can be extended naturally
to the 2 f -dimensional case. Also in Chap. 2, they showed how the scheme can deal with
degenerate as well as non-degenerate quantum systems.
Chapter 3 was written by Born. He had the advantage over Heisenberg and Jordan
in having in-depth knowledge of the mathematical advances carried out by Hilbert and
Hellinger which turned out to be exactly the tools needed to complete the formulation of
matrix mechanics. As Born expressed it,
‘But behind the formalism of this perturbation theory there lurks a very simple, purely
algebraic connection. . . . Apart from the deeper insight into the mathematical structure
of the theory, we thereby gain the advantage of being able to use the methods and results
developed earlier in mathematics.’
Born’s remark refers to his realisation that the transformation of matrices can be regarded
as equivalent to a system of linear transformations for bilinear forms. The reason is that, to
every matrix a = [a(nm)], there corresponds a bilinear form deﬁned by
A(xy) =

nm
a(nm)xnym ,
(12.69)
of the two series of variables x1, x2, . . . , xn and y1, y2, . . . , yn. One of the features of the
matrix elements of a is that they should be Hermitian so that the squares of the amplitudes
are real numbers. In the standard theory, Hermitian matrices are deﬁned such that the
transposed matrix a∗is equal to its complex conjugate ˜a, that is, ˜a = a∗. In terms of
bilinear forms, their Hermitian properties are deﬁned by a(mn) = a∗(nm). Then, if we
write yn = x∗
n, it follows that
A(xx∗) =

nm
a(nm) xn x∗
m
(12.70)
is real.
The importance of these considerations is that the theory of bilinear forms had been
pioneered by Hilbert and his studies were brought together in his book Grundz¨uge einer
allgemeinen Theorie der linearen Integralgleichungen (Hilbert, 1912). In particular, he
showed that, for a ﬁnite number of variables, it is always possible to carry out an orthog-
onal transformation of a bilinear form to a sum of squares, the procedure known as the
transformation to principal axes, speciﬁcally,
A(xx∗) =

n
Wnyny∗
n .
(12.71)
Rewriting this expression in terms of matrices, there exists an orthogonal matrix v such
that
v˜v∗= I
and
va˜v∗= vav−1 = W ,
(12.72)
where W = (Wnδnm) is a diagonal matrix. Born knew that the problem of the diagonalisation
of Hermitian forms was equivalent to an ‘eigenvalue problem’ and he called the solutions
for Wn the eigenvalues of the set of linear equations

a typical eigenvalue equation. As van der Waerden remarks, for Born the eigenvalues were
mathematical tools for determining the energy levels of the atomic system. Only with
the somewhat different approach of Schr¨odinger was it appreciated that the eigenvectors
(x1, x2, . . .) determine the properties of the stationary states of the atom.
Born and his colleagues also appreciated that, in addition to enabling the energy levels of
the atomic systems to be determined, the formalism of Hilbert and Hellinger also enabled
continuous spectra to be treated. Continuous spectra are solutions of the same equations
of motion, but the orthogonality relations now need to be written in terms of differential
spectra rather than discrete spectral lines. As they wrote in their paper,
‘The simultaneous appearance of both continuous and line spectra as solutions of the
same equations of motion and the same commutation relations seemed to us to represent a
particularly signiﬁcant feature of the new theory. . . . there nevertheless are characteristic
distinctions, both mathematically and physically, between continuous and discrete spectra,
corresponding to the differences between Fourier series and Fourier integrals in classical
theory.’
They illustrate the differences by considering the classical analogues of periodic and ape-
riodic motions. In the case of multiply periodic systems such as those considered in the
old quantum theory, a Fourier series a(ν) can be associated with oscillations of the form
exp(2πiνt). In contrast, for aperiodic motions, it is necessary to work in terms of Fourier
integrals where ϕ(ν) dν takes the place of a(ν). In the quantum mechanical case, the quan-
tities q(kl) are replaced by the differential quantities q(k, W) dW or q(W, W ′) dW dW ′,
depending on whether one or both indices lie in the continuous region, where we denote
states in the continuum by the Ws. Thus, the quantities to be subject to the orthogonality
conditions are differential energies rather than total energies.
It turned out that Ernst Hellinger, an old friend of Born’s, had completed his doctoral
dissertation at G¨ottingen in 1907 under Hilbert’s supervision on precisely the topic of
bilinear forms which could not be represented by discrete quantities q(kl) (Hellinger, 1909).

These matrices can then be used to reduce the momentum and coordinate matrices to

resulting in four types of elements for p, which are illustrated schematically in the matrix

These correspond to four types of transition: top left, from ellipse to ellipse; top right, from
ellipse to hyperbola; bottom left, from hyperbola to ellipse; bottom right, from hyperbola
to hyperbola. In the language of atomic physics, these correspond to bound–bound, bound–
free, free–bound and free–free transitions.
12.3.3 The quantisation of angular momentum
The fourth and ﬁnal chapter of the Three-Man Paper concerned physical applications of
the theory. The ﬁrst part of the chapter is devoted to the laws of conservation of momentum
and angular momentum and the determination of selections rules for transitions between
stationary states.

First of all, the matrix expressions for the components Mx, My, Mz of the total angular
momentum of the system M were written down by analogy with their classical counterparts.
Mx =
f/3

k=1
(pkyqkz −qkypkz) ,

Mz =
f/3

k=1
(pkxqky −qkxpky) .
(12.81)
Just as in the classical case, in the absence of external torques, these components are
conserved, but this now follows from the commutation properties of the ps and qs. Similarly,
total linear momentum and the components of the linear momentum are conserved in the
absence of forces
p =
f/3

k=1
pk = constant ,
px =

k=1
pkx = constant ,
. . .
(12.82)
From the commutation relations (12.68), they immediately derived the fundamental quan-
tum mechanical relation
MxMy −MyMx =
h
2πiMz .
(12.83)
The total angular momentum M is a diagonal matrix and its square commutes with the
z-component of the angular momentum:
M2Mz −MzM2 = 0 .
(12.84)
The elements of the diagonal total angular momentum matrix M2 were shown to be j( j +
1)(h/2π)2 where j is an integer or half-integer. Finally, the selection rules for transitions
were shown to be
m →m + 1
or
m
or
m −1 ,
(12.85)
j →j + 1
or
j
or
j −1 ,
(12.86)
where the js and ms are integers or half-integers and m ≤j. These are precisely the rules
which had been derived empirically by Land´e and his colleagues. The formalism also
enabled the intensities and polarisations of the lines to be determined.
After a brief discussion of the Zeeman effect, the paper concludes with an analysis by
Jordan of the statistics of the wave ﬁelds emitted by an ensemble of harmonic oscillators.
Using the new formalism, he was able to recover Einstein’s expression (3.41) for the
ﬂuctuations in black-body radiation

12.4 Pauli’s theory of the hydrogen atom
where zν dν is the number of eigenvibrations, or normal modes, in the frequency interval ν
to ν + dν.
12.3.4 Reflections
The Three-Man Paper was a quite remarkable achievement. The three authors were entering
entirely new areas of theoretical physics using new mathematical tools. The extraordinary
feature of their work is that they successfully worked out all the essential features of
the full theory of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. But this was achieved at a price –
the mathematics was known to relatively few physicists and the physical content of the
theory was not yet fully understood. The authors were well aware of this. In his introduction,
Heisenberg made every effort to endow the theory with physical meaning, but there was still
some way to go. Fortunately, they were in continuous correspondence with their theoretical
colleagues, in particular, with Pauli and Weyl. Once the clues were provided, they rapidly
produced independent analyses which resulted in the same set of commutation relations.
Still, the community of physicists at large was wary of the complexity of the new theory
until Pauli used the new matrix methods to derive the energy levels and selection rules for
the hydrogen atom.
12.4 Pauli’s theory of the hydrogen atom
Pauli was sceptical about matrix mechanics, still railing against what he perceived to be
Born’s excessively formal mathematical approach to the problems of quantum physics. He
felt that the 43-year old Born should leave the problems of quantum physics to the new
generation of young physicists – in his opinion, the new physics was Knabenphysik, young
man’s physics. Even by October 1925, he was still opposed to the G¨ottingen approach, as
he wrote to Ralph Kronig:
‘One must ﬁrst seek to liberate Heisenberg’s mechanics from G¨ottingen’s deluge of formal
learning and better expose its physical essence.’
Heisenberg was not to take this lying down. Having seen Pauli’s letter to Kronig, he
responded:
‘With respect to both of your last letters I must preach you a sermon, and beg your
pardon for proceeding in Bavarian: It really is a pigsty that you cannot stop indulging
in a slanging match. Your eternal reviling of Copenhagen and G¨ottingen is a shrieking
scandal. . . . When you reproach us that we are such big donkeys that we have never
produced anything new in physics, it may well be true. But then, you are also an equally
big jackass because you have not accomplished it either . . . ’
This provoked Pauli into action, showing the G¨ottingen physicists that he could beat them
at their own game. Born, Heisenberg and Jordan were well aware that the ‘crown jewels’
would be the demonstration that the new theory of matrix mechanics could account for

Matrix mechanics
the Balmer spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom was now
regarded, even by Bohr himself, as an ‘accident’ – according to the new perspective, it was
meaningless to talk about electron orbits since they did not correspond to observables. The
Three-Man Paper, however much it struck right at the heart of quantum mechanics, did not
produce the answer, much to their frustration.
The problem they encountered was that the matrix formalism could not be applied
directly to the conjugate of the angular momentum matrix M. Classically, the conjugate of
the action variable J is the angle variable φ, but there was no matrix corresponding to φ.
In the second section of his paper, Pauli explained the problem:
‘. . . we must ﬁrst . . . develop the requisite rules for simultaneously operating with matrices
x, y and z of the Cartesian coordinates of the electron . . . , the matrix r of the magnitude
of the radius vector, and their time derivatives. The present version of the laws of the
new quantum mechanics requires that we avoid the introduction of a polar angle φ. Since
this is not conﬁned within ﬁnite limits, it cannot, namely, be formally represented as a
matrix in the same way as the above-mentioned coordinates, which execute librations2 in
classical mechanics.’
Pauli quickly mastered the techniques of matrix mechanics and then discovered an
ingenious route for circumventing the problems associated with the polar angle φ. He had
just completed a major survey of quantum physics for the Handbuch der Physik and in that
review he described the approach to the analysis of orbits in an inverse-square law ﬁeld by
his colleague at Hamburg, Wilhelm Lenz (Pauli, 1926). Lenz avoided using the angle φ by
introducing another constant of the motion, the vector A, which was deﬁned by
A = 4πϵ0
Ze2m0
[M × p] + r
r ,
(12.88)
where m0 is the mass of the electron, p its linear momentum, M its angular momentum
vector and r the vector from the focus to a point on the ellipse. The signiﬁcance of A can
be appreciated from the following calculation. Taking the scalar product of A with r,
A · r = 4πϵ0

since M = r × p. This is exactly the expression for the elliptical orbit of an electron in an

and ε is the eccentricity of the ellipse. This result provides a physical interpretation of the
meaning of the vector A. Comparison of (12.89) and (12.90) shows that the magnitude of
A is the eccentricity ε of the ellipse and that the vector points from one focus of the ellipse

along the major axis towards the other focus, as can be appreciated from the geometry of
Fig. 5.1.
Next, (12.90) can be written in terms of the energy W of the orbit. According to classical
dynamics, the total energy of the elliptical orbit under the inﬂuence of the inverse-square
law of electrostatics is
W = T + U = −U
2 = −Ze2
8πϵ0a
where
a =

(1 −ε2) .
(12.91)
T and U are the kinetic and electrostatic potential energies respectively and a is the length
of the semi-major axis of the ellipse. This result was derived in Sect. 5.2 as expression
(5.22). Substituting the value of λ from (12.90),

that is,

.
(12.93)
The importance of this result for Pauli was the fact that the orbits of the ellipses in the
old quantum theory were conﬁned to a plane and were characterised by two variables, the
action–angle variables J and φ. Now, he had two independent vectors which are constants
of the motion, M and A, which do not suffer from the problems of the angle variable. In
addition, (12.93) depended only upon the values of the two constants of the motion and the
energy of the orbit. Pauli realised that the energies of the stationary states could be found
by converting this classical formalism into the new matrix mechanics and then the energy
levels of the hydrogen atom could be determined according to the prescription of Born,
Heisenberg and Jordan.
In an extraordinary tour de force, he now set about converting the vectors M and A into
matrix form, using his own very considerable ability at ‘formal mathematics’ as well as
ingenuity and insight in making the problem of the hydrogen atom soluble. An outline of
his calculation is as follows.4
First of all, the angular momentum matrix was deﬁned as M = me(r × v) and was
shown to commute with the Hamiltonian matrix of the one-electron atom. Hence, the
angular momentum was a constant of the motion. Next, from (12.88) he deﬁned the matrix
corresponding to A as
A = 4πϵ0
Ze2m0

(12.98)
The objective was now to ﬁnd the eigenvalues associated with the solutions of (12.98) but
Pauli was well aware of the fact that they would be degenerate. The same problem occurred
in the old quantum theory in which the energies of ellipses with the same semi-major axes
were all the same. There was, however, a standard procedure for relieving the degeneracy,
which had already been used by Born and Pauli in a paper of 1922, and that was to perturb
the Hamiltonian by the addition of a term of the from λH1 which would split the degenerate
energy levels. To achieve the complete separation of the levels, Pauli included two types of
perturbation in H1, a non-Coulomb radial ﬁeld and a magnetic ﬁeld in the z-direction. As
the small parameter λ tends to zero, the solution for the degenerate case is recovered.
Pauli knew about the rules of quantisation of angular momentum described in Sect. 12.3.3
and used these to obtain the same result as Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926) that the
eigenvalues of the matrix M2 were j( j + 1)(h/2π). The determination of the elements
of the matrix A remained a challenge which Pauli solved using the rules for the relative
intensities of the Zeeman components which had previously been derived by H¨onl (1925)
and Goudsmit and Kronig (1925). Finally, Pauli obtained the result that the absolute values
of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom were
Wn = H( j, m; j, m) =
Z2e4m0
8ϵ2
0h2( jmax + 1)2 .
(12.99)
Setting jmax + 1 = n, Bohr’s formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom (4.25) was
recovered:
Wn = Z2e4m0
8ϵ2
0h2n2 .
(12.100)
In coming to this spectacular result, Pauli obtained other key features of the hydrogen atom
as well. He showed that the values of j and m had to be integers and that the maximum
value of the angular momentum quantum number jmax = n −1, where n = 1 is the ground
state. Thus, unlike the old quantum theory, the lowest energy state of the hydrogen atom
has zero angular momentum. This is a pure quantum mechanical result, quite unlike the
lowest energy state of the Bohr atom. This had the effect of getting rid of the empirical
restrictions which had to be placed upon the allowed orbits in the old quantum theory, for
example, the exclusion of linear orbits in which the electron passes through the nucleus
(Sect. 5.2). It will be recognised that Pauli had derived many of the essential features of the
quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom.
In addition, the same new quantum conditions resolved the problem of the motion of the
electron in the hydrogen atom under the inﬂuence of crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
According to the old quantum theory, the perturbation of the energy of the state Wn in the
presence of crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds was

12.5 The triumph of matrix mechanics
where ω1 = νL + νs, ω2 = |νL −νs|, νL is the Larmor frequency and νs is the precession
frequency associated with the Stark effect. Pauli showed that according to the new quantum
theory, the quantum number n should be replaced by jmax = n −1, again eliminating linear
orbits in which the electron passes through the nucleus. In the old quantum theory, these
orbits had to be excluded arbitrarily since they violated the adiabatic principle.
12.5 The triumph of matrix mechanics and its incompleteness
Pauli’s achievement in solving the problem of the hydrogen atom according to matrix me-
chanics was universally applauded as a triumph for the new quantum mechanics. Pauli had
carried out the calculations described in Sect. 12.4 in only three weeks and communicated
the results to Heisenberg, who wrote on 3 November 1925,
‘I need not tell you how delighted I am about the new theory of hydrogen and how
pleasantly surprised I am about the speed with which you produced this theory.’
Bohr learned about Pauli’s new results from Kramers soon after this date and immediately
wrote to Pauli:
‘To my great joy I heard from Kramers that you have succeeded in deriving the Balmer
formula.’
Pauli responded by sending Bohr and his colleagues details of his calculations which
impressed them greatly. Bohr wrote to Pauli on 5 December 1925:
‘Kramers, Kronig and I, who have just gone once again with the greatest pleasure through
your beautiful calculation of the hydrogen spectrum, send you many friendly greetings
from Tisvelde.’
These remarkable calculations convinced most physicists that the new matrix mechanics
had the power to account for quantum phenomena in a self-consistent fashion.
The new quantum mechanics was however unfamiliar to the physicist-in-the-street and
there were relatively few problems which could be successfully addressed by the formalism
as it stood. The helium atom was still too hard and the spin of the electron still had to be
incorporated into the scheme of quantum mechanics.
One other notable success was the matrix mechanics of diatomic molecules which was
carried out by Lucie Mensing, a graduate student of Wilhelm Lenz in Hamburg. The two
papers of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1925b; 1926) had already considered the cases of
the nonlinear oscillator and the rotator in quantum mechanics and so she was able to use
much of the material already in these papers to address the quantisation of the vibrational
and rotational stationary states of diatomic molecules (Mensing, 1926). She found that the
energy states of the diatomic molecule were given by the expression

Matrix mechanics
This expression has a similar form to the classical expression for the vibrational and
rotational frequencies of a diatomic molecule, but with some important differences:
r The second term on the right-hand side represents the rotational states of the molecule
with the classical j2 being replaced by the quantum mechanical j( j + 1).
r The third term corresponds to the classical term hn(ν0 + βj2) and describes the har-
monic oscillations of the nuclei relative to their centre of mass and the mixed rotational-
vibrational modes.
r The fourth term describes the anharmonicity of the oscillations and replaces the classical
term hαn2.
r Particularly important was the inclusion of the factor (n + 1
2) in the third term. The term
one-half corresponds to the zero point energy of the oscillator and its presence resolved
the discrepancy between the experimental values of the vibrational modes of the molecule
and the classical theory. To account for this discrepancy half-integral quantum numbers
had been introduced, but Mensing’s calculation now showed that this was unnecessary.
The only allowed transitions were associated with j = ±1 for the rotational terms and
n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . for the vibrational terms.
The successes of matrix mechanics was undeniable, but there was still a long way to
go before the full richness of quantum phenomena could be encompassed by a fully self-
consistent theory. Matrix mechanics was only the ﬁrst step along the route to the modern
theory of quantum mechanics.

Dirac’s quantum mechanics
G¨ottingen and Copenhagen were the undoubted capitals of the new discipline of quantum
mechanics. The expertise in experimental and mathematical physics and in pure math-
ematics made G¨ottingen the epicentre of the revolution which was taking place in the
mathematical physics of quanta. Whilst this was to remain the case for the next few years,
other actors soon appeared on the scene who were to contribute to Born’s ‘tangle of inter-
connected alleys’. What was truly remarkable was how quickly the different approaches to
the problems of quantum theory were developed and the rapid assimilation of all of them
into a coherent and self-consistent theory of quantum mechanics. Whilst the theory itself
was completed relatively quickly, the understanding of its physical content was to take
many more years.
The new players on the scene included Paul Dirac at Cambridge, Erwin Schr¨odinger in
Vienna and Norbert Wiener at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Each of them
brought quite new approaches to the development of quantum theory – their innovations
were to supersede the matrix mechanics of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan, but there can
be no doubt that the success of that theory indicated clearly the route ahead. They were
however to involve the introduction of new mathematical techniques into the description of
quantum phenomena.
13.1 Dirac’s approach to quantum mechanics
Paul Dirac was trained as an electrical engineer at Bristol University, but he had a very
strong mathematical bent. He was a solitary character who was notoriously quiet and self-
effacing. He simply worked things out on his own. He was interested in problems which
could be treated on a strict mathematical basis and looked for beauty in the mathematics
needed to describe nature. On the one hand, his training as an engineer had taught him to be
somewhat pragmatic about the mathematics necessary to address any particular problem.
As he wrote in his memoirs of 1967,
‘I think if I had not had this engineering training, I should not have had any success with
the kind of work I did later on, because it was really necessary to get away from the point
of view that one should only deal with exact equations, and that one should deal only with
results which could be deduced logically from known exact laws which one accepted,
in which one had implicit faith. Engineers were concerned only with getting equations
which were useful for describing nature. . . .

Dirac’s quantum mechanics
And that led me of course to the view that this outlook was really the best outlook to
have. We wanted a description of Nature. We wanted to ﬁnd the equations which would
describe Nature, and the best we could hope for was usually approximate equations, and
we would have to reconcile ourselves to an absence of strict logic . . . ’ (Dirac, 1977)
On the other hand, the theory had to be ‘beautiful’. In the same memoir, he writes about
his meeting with Schr¨odinger:
‘. . . of all the physicists that I met, I think Schr¨odinger was the one that I felt to be
most closely similar to myself. I found myself getting into agreement with Schr¨odinger
more readily than with anyone else. I believe the reason for this was that Schr¨odinger
and I both had a very strong appreciation of mathematical beauty, and this appreciation
of mathematical beauty dominated all our work. It was a sort of faith with us that any
equations which described the fundamental laws of Nature must have great mathematical
beauty in them. It was like a religion with us. It was a very proﬁtable religion to hold, and
can be considered as the basis for much of our success.’ (Dirac, 1977)
13.2 Dirac and Thefundamentalequationsof
quantummechanics (1925)
Picking up the story from the end of Chap. 11, Heisenberg left the decision about whether
or not to publish his revolutionary paper of 1925 to Born, since he had to leave for
Cambridge where he was to deliver a lecture to the Kapitsa Club on 28 July 1925. These
gatherings had been instituted by Piotr Kapitsa and at them the latest developments in
physics were discussed by the staff and research students of the Cavendish Laboratory
and other cognate departments. Dirac was a member of the club. The title of Heisenberg’s
talk was Termzoologie und Zeemanbotanik and was principally concerned with his recent
researches into the anomalous Zeeman effect. Dirac had only vague memories of the
meeting, but some discussion of Heisenberg’s most recent work on the fundamentals of
quantum mechanics took place either during the lecture or in the informal discussions
afterwards. Ralph Fowler, who was Dirac’s supervisor, was impressed by what Heisenberg
described about this new work and asked Heisenberg to send copies of the proofs of his
paper when they became available. This duly happened a few weeks later and Fowler sent
the proofs to Dirac, who had returned home to Bristol for part of the vacation, seeking his
opinion on Heisenberg’s work.
In Dirac’s words,
‘I received it (the proofs) either at the end of August or the beginning of September . . . At
ﬁrst I was not very impressed by it. It seemed to me to be too complicated. I just did not
see the main point of it, and in particular his determination of quantum conditions seemed
to me too far fetched, so I just put it aside as being of no interest. However, a week or ten
days later I returned to this paper of Heisenberg’s and studied it more closely. And then I
suddenly realised that it did provide the key to the whole solution of the difﬁculties which
we were concerned with.

13.2 Thefundamentalequationsofquantummechanics
My previous work had been allconcerned with studying individualstates . . . Heisenberg
brought out the quite new idea that one had to consider quantities associated with two
stationary states rather than one.’
But this scarcely does justice to the profound impact Heisenberg’s paper had upon Dirac. He
quickly homed in on Heisenberg’s discovery that the variables involved at the quantum level
do not commute. Dirac’s great achievement in his paper of 1925 was to recast Heisenberg’s
insights into the language of Hamiltonian dynamics. As expressed by Jammer,
‘In a few weeks’ time he achieved his objective and thus established one of the most
profound and useful relations between quantum mechanics and the classical Hamilton–
Jacobi formulation of mechanics.’ (Jammer, 1989)
13.2.1 Reformulating non-commutability
Like Born, Dirac appreciated that the deep insights in Heisenberg’s paper were the introduc-
tion of quantities which depended upon two variables rather than one and the fact that these
quantities were non-commuting, the feature which greatly disturbed Heisenberg. Born’s
analysis led to the development of matrix mechanics which was the subject of Chap. 12.
Quite independently and entirely on his own, Dirac discovered a rather different and, in the
end, more powerful approach to the reformulation of quantum mechanics. An important
aspect of Dirac’s approach was that he ﬁrmly believed that, whatever the correct formulation
of the theory, it should be derivable from Hamiltonian mechanics, a subject in which he
was already an expert. Like most theorists at the time, he had become ﬂuent in the use of
the techniques of Hamilton–Jacobi theory and of action-angle variables in the old quantum
theory. As he remarked much later,
‘At that time, I was expecting some kind of connection between the new mechanics and
Hamiltonian dynamics (as Hamiltonian dynamics was used so much with Sommerfeld’s
development of the Bohr theory) and it seemed to me that this connection should show
up with large quantum numbers.’
Notice again Bohr’s correspondence principle at work.
To appreciate what Dirac did, let us recall the Heisenberg prescription for taking the
product of the quantities x and y, what Dirac refers to as the ‘Heisenberg product’. Following
Jammer (1989), consider the one-dimensional classical case, that is, a system of one degree
of freedom, in which x and y are functions of the action–angle variables J and w. As in
(11.13), for a multiply periodic system, x(n, t) and y(n, t) can be written as Fourier series:
x = x(n, t) = x(J, w) =

y = y(n, t) = y(J, w) =

(13.2)
where, according to the old quantum theory, J = nh. In Heisenberg’s scheme, the quantities
xτ(J) and yτ(J) correspond to the quantum quantities x(n, n −τ) and y(n, n −τ). Dirac
was interested in the limit of large quantum numbers n ≫τ, expecting that in this limit he

would ﬁnd the classical analogue of xy −yx. The (n, n −τ −σ) component of xy −yx
is given by the difference of Heisenberg products
(xy −yx)n,n−τ−σ = [x(n, n −τ) y(n −τ, n −τ −σ) −y(n, n −σ) x(n −σ, n −τ −σ)]
× exp[iω(n, n −τ −σ)t] .
(13.3)
Concentrating on the terms in the ﬁrst pair of square brackets on the right-hand side
of (13.3), this expression can be rewritten by subtracting and adding x(n −σ, n −τ −
σ) y(n −τ, n −τ −σ) to each of the terms so that
x(n, n −τ) y(n −τ, n −τ −σ) −y(n, n −σ) x(n −σ, n −τ −σ)
= [x(n, n −τ) −x(n −σ, n −σ −τ)] y(n −τ, n −τ −σ)
−[y(n, n −σ) −y(n −τ, n −τ −σ)] x(n −σ, n −τ −σ) .
(13.4)
Now, working backwards, these Heisenberg products can be converted into their classical
equivalents for large quantum numbers n ≫τ + σ using the equivalences x(n, n −τ) →
xτ(J) and y(n, n −σ) →yσ(J). Then,
⎧

Therefore, (13.4) becomes

= 2πi [τyτ(J) exp (2πiτw)] .

13.2 Thefundamentalequationsofquantummechanics
There is a delightful story about how Dirac realised the signiﬁcance of Poisson brackets
during the exciting days of October 1925. Dirac had a strict rule about relaxing on Sunday
afternoons by taking country walks around Cambridge. In his memoirs, he writes:
‘It was during one of the Sunday Walks in October 1925 when I was thinking very
much about this uv −vu, in spite of my intention to relax, that I thought about Poisson
brackets . . . I did not remember very well what a Poisson bracket was. I did not remember
the precise formula for a Poisson bracket and only had some vague recollections. But there
were exciting possibilities there and I thought I might be getting on to some big new idea.
Of course, I could not [ﬁnd out what a Poisson bracket was] right out in the country. I
just had to hurry home and see what I could then ﬁnd out about Poisson brackets. I looked
through my notes and there was no reference there anywhere to Poisson brackets. The text
books which I had at home were all too elementary to mention them. There was nothing I
could do, because it was Sunday evening then and the libraries were all closed. I just had
to wait impatiently through that night without knowing whether this idea was any good or
not but still I think my conﬁdence grew during the course of the night. The next morning,
I hurried along to one of the libraries as soon as it was open and then I looked up Poisson
brackets in Whittaker’s Analytic Dynamics [(1917)] and I found that they were just what
I needed. They provided the perfect analogy with the commutator.’
13.2.2 Poisson brackets
Like so many topics in analytic dynamics which have appeared in this story, Poisson
introduced what are now known as Poisson brackets in the course of a study of an n-body
problem in astronomy, namely, the motion of a planet about the Sun in the presence of the
(n −1) other planets. His problem was to solve the 3n Euler–Lagrange equations of motion
(5.59) in the presence of the time-varying perturbation  of the gravitational potential due
to the other planets. The full signiﬁcance of Poisson’s pioneering studies was only fully
appreciated later in the century when Jacobi independently discovered the power of Poisson
brackets. Jacobi referred to Poisson’s combination rule for Poisson brackets1 as ‘the most
profound discovery of Monsieur Poisson’ and ‘the most important theorem in dynamics’
(Jacobi, 1841).
The Poisson bracket2 of the functions g and h is deﬁned to be

Dirac’s quantum mechanics
Therefore, Hamilton’s equations can be rewritten
˙qi = [H, qi] ,
˙pi = [H, pi] .
(13.13)
What Dirac appreciated was that the Poisson brackets have exactly the commutation prop-
erties needed to describe the non-commutation features of the difference of Heisenberg
products xy −yx. Thus, in (13.10), if we set g = qi and h = q j, or g = pi and h = p j,
we obtain the results
[qi, q j] = 0 ,
[pi, p j] = 0 ,
(13.14)
because of the independence of the qis and pis. Furthermore, if j ̸= k,
[p j, qk] = 0 .
(13.15)
If, however, g = pk and h = qk, then
[pk, qk] = 1 ,
[q j, pk] = −1 .
(13.16)
Pairs of quantities with zero Poisson brackets are said to commute, whereas those with
Poisson brackets equal to unity are non-commuting. Pairs of quantities with Poisson brackets
equal to unity are said to be canonically conjugate. From (13.13), it follows that any quantity
which commutes with the Hamiltonian H does not change with time. In particular, H is a
constant of the motion since it commutes with itself.
But the Poisson brackets had other key properties. Most important was the fact that all
sets of dynamical variables Qk and Pk which are obtained from qk and pk by a canonical
transformation which leaves the Hamilton equations of motion unaltered, also leave their
Poisson brackets unchanged. We can summarise (13.14)–(13.16) by the expressions
[qk, pi] = δki ,
[qk, qi] = [pk, pi] = 0 ,
(13.17)
where δki is the Kronecker symbol meaning δki = 1 if k = i and zero otherwise. Then, if
Qk and Pk are obtained from qk and pk by a canonical transformation, it follows that
[Qk, Pi] = δki ,
[Qk, Qi] = [Pk, Pi] = 0 .
(13.18)
Furthermore, the Poisson brackets of any two functions F1 and F2 remain invariant under
all such transformations,

These and many other properties of Poisson brackets were included in Whittaker’s Ana-
lytic Dynamics and Dirac immediately set about rewriting Heisenberg’s insight in terms
of Hamiltonian dynamics. The great advance was that Dirac could now write down the
quantisation conditions in terms of classical Hamiltonian dynamics, using the equivalence
of the difference of Heisenberg products to Poisson brackets. From (13.9), this equivalence

(13.21)
There is another key feature of Dirac’s approach to quantum mechanics. Notice that the
procedure embeds quantum mechanics into the very heart of Hamiltonian dynamics. Just
as Heisenberg appreciated that he had applied quantum concepts to space itself, so Dirac
had done the same thing by treating the momentum and space coordinates on the same
footing and introducing Bohr’s quantisation condition into the foundations of Hamiltonian
mechanics. As expressed by Jammer (1989)
‘. . . Dirac absorbed, so to speak, the correspondence principle as an integral part of the
very foundation of his theory and, like Heisenberg, disposed thereby of the necessity of
resorting to Bohr’s principle each time a problem had to be solved.’
13.2.3 Thefundamentalequationsofquantummechanics (1925)
Dirac quickly wrote his paper with the above title and showed it to Fowler who fully
appreciated its importance. Fowler communicated the paper to the Royal Society for rapid
publication in the Proceedings of the Royal Society and it was received on 7 November
1925 – it was published on 1 December 1925. Dirac’s perspective was clearly laid out in
the introduction:
‘In a recent paper, Heisenberg [(1925)] puts forward a new theory which suggests that it
is not the equations of classical mechanics that are in any way at fault, but that the mathe-
matical operations by which physical results are deduced from them require modiﬁcation.
All the information supplied by the classical theory can thus be made use of in the new
theory.’
After summarising Heisenberg’s innovations, Dirac rewrites the Heisenberg product as
follows,
xy(nm) =

k
x(nk) y(km) .
(13.22)
Born had made the same simpliﬁcation and realised that (13.22) represented matrix multi-
plication. Dirac took the more general view that (13.22) should be the multiplication rule
for the quantum variables x and y without specifying at this stage exactly what they were.
They had however to obey the addition rule
{x + y}(nm) = x(nm) + y(nm) ,
(13.23)
as in the case of matrix addition. But now, Dirac takes a different route. He considers
the rules for differentiation of the quantum variables x and y which are functions of the
parameter v. As discussed by Mehra and Rechenberg, he now applied his knowledge of
projective geometry to the problem of deﬁning the differentiation dx/dv of the quantum
variable x. His key insight was that there should be a linear relation between dx/dv and

Dirac’s quantum mechanics
x. This is consistent with the fact that both dx/dv and x can be represented by Fourier
series of the form (13.1). Therefore, he assumed that the (nm) component of dx/dv could
be written as
dx
dv =

n′m′
a(nm; n′m′)x(n′m′) .
(13.24)
He then argued that quantum differentiation should satisfy the following conditions:
d
dv (x + y) = d
dv x + d
dv y ,
(13.25)
d(xy)
dv
= d
dv x · y + x · d
dv y ,
(13.26)
where the order of multiplication of the variables in (13.26) has to be preserved. Dirac now
carried out an analysis of the constraints on the process of quantum differentiation with
respect to v assuming that the rules (13.24) and (13.25) had to be maintained. From this
analysis, he concluded that the most general form of quantum differentiation was
dx
dv = xa −ax ,
(13.27)
where the new quantum variable a has components a(nm). Thus, the differential of the
quantum variable x with respect to any parameter v is expressed as the difference of
the Heisenberg products of the quantum variables x and a. This key result showed that the
differential equations of classical mechanics were to be replaced by algebraic equations
involving the addition and multiplication of quantum variables. Dirac was now in a position
to apply the full apparatus of classical Hamiltonian dynamics to quantum mechanics.
Particularly notable was his derivation of Bohr’s quantisation condition according to the
new formalism. Just as in the case of matrix mechanics, ‘diagonal’ terms of the form C(nn)
correspond to constants of the motion. Therefore, the Hamiltonian terms H(nn) correspond
to the energies of the stationary states of the system. From (13.13), it follows that
˙x = [H, x] .
(13.28)
Combining this with the fundamental relation (13.20),
x H −Hy = ih
2π [x, H] ,
(13.29)
it follows that
x(nm)H(mm) −H(nn)x(nm) = ih
2π ˙x(nm) = −h
2π · ω(nm)x(nm) ,
(13.30)
since the time dependence of x(nm) is entirely determined by the term exp[iω(nm)t].
Hence,
hν(nm) = h
2π ω(nm) = H(nn) −H(mm) = En −Em ,
(13.31)
where En and Em are the energies of the stationary states n and m.

13.3 Quantum algebra
Fowler fully appreciated the deep signiﬁcance of Dirac’s paper and this was corroborated
by the response of Heisenberg, to whom Dirac had sent a manuscript copy of his paper. On
20 November 1925, Heisenberg wrote to Dirac as follows:
‘I have read your extraordinarily beautiful paper on quantum mechanics with the greatest
interest, and there can be no doubt that all your results are correct as far as one believes
at all in the newly proposed theory. . . . [Dirac’s paper was] also really better written and
more concentrated than our attempts here [in G¨ottingen].’
Heisenberg particularly liked the derivation of Bohr’s frequency condition, which used
rather general principles rather than a speciﬁc model of atomic systems. Dirac was well
aware that Born, Heisenberg and Jordan had developed their matrix mechanical approach
to quantum mechanics and so he immediately turned all his energies to perfecting his own
rather different approach.
13.3 Quantum algebra, q- and c-numbers and the hydrogen atom
Dirac had stressed the formal algebraic nature of the quantum variables in his paper of
1925, but he now formalised the concept by introducing a distinction between the quantum
variables, which he called q-numbers, and the ordinary numbers of arithmetic, which he
called c-numbers. As he wrote, ‘q stands for quantum, or maybe queer, and c for classical,
or maybe commuting’ (Dirac, 1977). He makes this distinction clear in the introduction to
his paper (Dirac, 1926d).
‘The fact that the variables used for describing a dynamical system do not satisfy the
commutative law means, of course, that they are not numbers in the sense of the word
previously used in mathematics. To distinguish the two kinds of numbers, we shall call
the quantum variables q-numbers and the numbers of classical mathematics which satisfy
the commutative law c-numbers . . .
At present one can form no picture of what a q-number is like. One cannot say that
one q-number is greater or lesser that another . . . One knows nothing of the processes by
which the numbers are formed except that they satisfy all the ordinary laws of algebra,
excluding the commutative law of multiplication . . . ’
In his reminiscences, he wrote
‘Now, I did not know anything about the real nature of q-numbers. Heisenberg’s matrices
I thought were just an example of q-numbers; maybe q-numbers were something more
general. . . . I proceeded to develop a theory in which I felt free to make any assumption
I wanted to, unless they led immediately to an inconsistency. I did not bother at all about
ﬁnding a precise mathematical nature for q-numbers, or any kind of precision in dealing
with them.’ (Dirac, 1977)
In this paper and three succeeding papers of 1926 (Dirac, 1926b,c,e), Dirac put the em-
phasis upon the new algebra necessary to accommodate Heisenberg’s rules for quantum
multiplication, the last paper published in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical

Dirac’s quantum mechanics
Society having the title On quantum algebra (Dirac, 1926b). We recall the remark at the
beginning of his paper of 1925 that
‘[it is] not the equations of classical mechanics that are in any way at fault, but that
the mathematical operations by which physical results are deduced from them require
modiﬁcation.’
In other words, it is not the forms of the laws of motion which are at fault – the wrong
algebra is being used to carry out the mathematical operations.
Dirac had exactly the right training for making this imaginative leap in the dark. From the
beginning he had a strong mathematical bent with a particular interest in geometry. After
his engineering degree at Bristol University, he studied for a second degree in mathematics,
which he completed in two rather than three years A particularly important inﬂuence was
Peter Fraser, an outstanding mathematics lecturer, from whom Dirac learned the importance
of rigorous mathematics, as opposed to the non-rigorous tools commonly used by engi-
neers and physicists. He also learned projective geometry which was to have an important
inﬂuence on his thinking.
At Cambridge, his supervisor was Ralph Fowler, the leading quantum theorist in Cam-
bridge who stimulated his interest in atomic problems. At the same time, he participated
regularly in the Saturday afternoon geometrical tea parties held by Henry Baker, the Lown-
dean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry. All Baker’s students were required to attend
these parties and there were lectures and discussions of geometrical topics after tea – Dirac
presented his ﬁrst lecture at one of these.
Baker’s masterpiece was his six-volume Principles of Geometry, published from 1922
to 1925, volume one of which was to be of special signiﬁcance for Dirac (Baker, 1922). In
his memoirs, Dirac wrote:
‘. . . I was always very much interested in geometry . . . You can divide all mathematicians
into two classes, those whose main interest is geometry, those whose main interest is
algebra. . . . Now, a good mathematician has to be a master of both geometry and of
algebra, and he has to be able to pass from one to the other quite freely according to the
nature of the problem that he is working on. . . . my preference was strongly on the side of
geometry, and has always remained so.’
Later, he remarks
‘[Projective geometry] was a most useful tool for research, but I did not mention it in my
published work. . . . I felt that most physicists were not familiar with it. When I obtained a
particular result, I translated it into an analytic form and put down the argument in terms
of equations. That was an argument which any physicist would be able to understand
without having had this special training.’
Although projective geometry had applications in relativity theory, no-one had considered
that it would have importance for quantum theory. Dirac, however, appreciated a key result
contained in Baker’s book, namely, that there existed a complete set of laws for ‘non-
commuting’ numbers, similar to those of ordinary commuting numbers.
Section III of Chap. 1 of Baker’s ﬁrst volume describes the elements of symbolic algebra
needed to represent geometrical operations (Baker, 1922). He uses the term symbol rather

than variable since the algebraic rules should apply for a wide range of mathematical
entities, for example, vectors, matrices and so on – he gives examples of various types of
symbols on pp. 68–69. These examples include 2 × 2 matrices with complex components
which were eventually to become Dirac spin matrices. Speciﬁcally, he demonstrates with
these examples that ‘the equation ab −ba is not generally true’. Baker stated the basic
axiom as follows:
‘The symbols which we ﬁrst introduce are, speaking in general terms, subject to all
the laws of ordinary algebra, except the commutative law of multiplication. They are
not necessarily, and will not be ﬁnally, arranged in order of magnitude, so that, in their
entirety, they are wider than the real numbers of arithmetic.’
It is remarkable that Dirac takes over, almost word-for-word, the foundations of Baker’s
symbolic algebra as the basis for his rules of quantum algebra. Pages 62–69 of Baker’s
book indicate clearly the source of Dirac’s insights and of his translation of the symbols of
projective geometry into the variables of quantum algebra.
Thus, if z1, z2 and z3 are q-numbers, they obey the rules of ordinary algebra as follows:
z1 + z2 = z2 + z1 ,
(z1 + z2) + z3 = z1 + (z2 + z3) ,
(z1z2)z3 = z1(z2z3) ,
z1(z2 + z3) = z1z2 + z1z3 ,
(z1 + z2)z3 = z1z3 + z2z3 .
If
z1z2 = 0 ,
either
z1 = 0
or
z2 = 0 ;
but
z1z2 ̸= z2z1 ,
in general, except when z1 or z2 is a c-number.
In Sect. 2, the rules of Poisson bracket manipulations are adapted for q-numbers. In
particular, the full apparatus of Hamiltonian mechanics can be taken over into his quantum
algebra of q-numbers. Thus, if Qr and Pr are canonical variables, which are functions of
q-numbers, and these obey the rules for Poisson brackets
[Qr, Ps] = δrs ,
[Qr, Qs] = [Pr, Ps] = 0 ,
(13.32)
then, just as in Hamiltonian mechanics, Qr and Pr can be transformed to another set of
canonical variables qr and qs by relations of the form
Qr = bqrb−1 ,
Pr = bprb−1 ,
(13.33)
where b is a q-number. Notice the strong similarity to the canonical transformations (12.64)
introduced by Born and his colleagues in their matrix treatment of quantum algebra.
Interestingly, Dirac remarks that ‘these formulae do not appear to be of great practical
value’, whereas they were central to Born’s procedures for the transformation to principal
axes, that is, the diagonalisation of the matrices from which the energies of the stationary

Dirac’s quantum mechanics
states could be determined. By the same arguments, the equations of motion could be
written
˙x = [x, H] ,
(13.34)
where the Hamiltonian H is now a q-number. Dirac does not deﬁne what q-numbers are
until he is forced to confront the theory with experiment. He does however concede that,
in the case of multiply periodic motion, they can be represented by a set of harmonic
components of the form x(nm) exp iω(nm)t, where x(nm) and ω(nm) are c-numbers. Then
˙x has components iω(nm) x(nm) exp iω(nm)t.
Before proceeding to the application of this algebra to quantum mechanics, Dirac de-
velops a number of algebraic theorems which illustrate the care which has to be taken in
manipulating q-numbers, in particular, the order in which the operations are carried out.
Thus, for example, he establishes the results that
1
xy = 1
y · 1
x
;
d
dt
1
x

= −1
x ˙x 1
x .
(13.35)
The binomial expansion of (1 + x)n is the same as in ordinary algebra where n is a c-number
and the exponential series can be deﬁned as the same power series as in ordinary algebra.
Generally, however, ex+y ̸= ex ey, unless x and y commute.
Dirac now needed to show that the new formalism could be used to carry out useful
computations which could be compared with known results in quantum physics. This was
not a trivial task since there were relatively few problems which could be tackled with
the state of development of quantum algebra at the time. In his paper entitled Quantum
mechanics and a preliminary investigation of the hydrogen atom (Dirac, 1926d), Dirac
tackled the determination of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. To do this, he had to
convert the classical theory of multiply periodic systems into the language of q-numbers
and quantum algebra. He started with the advantage that he was already an expert on
the mathematical procedures of action–angle variables and their application to multiply
periodic systems. Section 4 of the paper carries out this translation. On the basis of his
new quantum algebra, he set out the postulates of the quantum theory of multiply periodic
dynamical systems where the action–angle variables Jr and wr are now q-numbers and so
have to obey the commutation relations.
Dirac showed that, using his new formalism he could work out the frequency of the orbits
of electrons in the hydrogen atom and Bohr’s quantum relation, noting that the quantities
involved were q-numbers rather than the c-numbers of the old quantum theory. In addition,
he derived Heisenberg’s multiplication rule for the quantities x and y,
xy(n, n −γ ) =

α
x(n, n −α)y(n −α, n −γ ) .
(13.36)
Sections 5, 6 and 7 are concerned with solving the orbital equations for the electron in
the hydrogen atom, but now using all the rules of quantum algebra. This analysis required
considerable care but resulted in a Hamiltonian of the form

2h and k2 = k −1
2h, k being the q-
number which describes the angular momentum, which is the conjugate momentum asso-
ciated with the angle variable θ.
After a detailed analysis, Dirac obtained the expression for the energies of the stationary
states of the hydrogen atom and the transition frequencies of the hydrogen atom in the

where P = mh and m takes integral values. This is precisely the formula for the lines in
the frequency spectrum of the hydrogen atom.
Dirac’s was no less of a tour de force than Pauli’s. They had both completed calculations
of very considerable complexity and, by quite different approaches – Pauli by applying the
concepts of matrix mechanics and Dirac by invoking his rules of quantum algebra – arrived
at the same result which agreed with experiment. In his correspondence with Heisenberg,
Dirac had been informed that Pauli had already solved the problem of the hydrogen atom
using matrix mechanics,4 but this did not worry Dirac particularly. From his point of view,
this was only a ‘reality check’, that quantum algebra was not just a theoretical construct,
but a version of quantum mechanics which could account for the results of experiment.
13.4 Multi-electron atoms, Onquantumalgebra and
a PhD dissertation
Dirac’s objective all along had been to use the formalism of quantum algebra to tackle the
problems of multi-electron atoms and this he proceeded to carry out, the end result being
the paper with the unpromising title The elimination of the nodes in quantum mechanics.
Once again, the inspiration had come from celestial mechanics and the problem of the orbits
of point masses acting under gravity. As expressed by Dirac,
‘In the classical treatment of the dynamical problem of a number of particles or electrons
moving in a central ﬁeld of force and disturbing one another, one always begins by
making the initial simpliﬁcation, known as the elimination of the nodes, which consists
in obtaining a contact transformation from the Cartesian co-ordinates and momenta of
the electrons to a set of canonical variables, of which all except three are independent
of the orientation of the system as a whole, while these three determine the orientation.
In the absence of an external ﬁeld of force, the Hamiltonian, when expressed in terms of
the new variables, must be independent of these three, which simpliﬁes the equations of
motion.’ (Dirac, 1926e)
The objective of the paper was to determine the necessary contact transformation to
enable the programme to be carried out. First of all, Dirac derived the properties of the q-
numbers representing linear and angular momentum in his quantum algebra and obtained
independently the rules for the quantisation of angular momentum which had already

Dirac’s quantum mechanics
been established by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926) (see Sect. 12.3.3). Next, the
appropriate forms of the action–angle variables are determined. Once this was achieved,
the transformation equations were determined, ﬁrst for a single electron, then for a system
of two electrons and ﬁnally for systems with more than two electrons. In the last case, the
multi-electron atom was modelled by the ‘core plus valance electron picture’ so that the
problem was reduced to a ‘two-electron’ problem (see Sect. 7.4).
The paper is once again a technical tour de force. Of particular interest is Dirac’s treat-
ment of the anomalous Zeeman effect in Sect. 9. He uses the standard atomic model of an
electron plus core and, following the experimental evidence for the anomalous value of the
gyromagnetic ratio (Sects. 7.5.2), gave the core twice the ratio of magnetic moment to an-
gular momentum as compared with the standard Lorenz value (7.39). With this assumption,
he derived an expression for the Land´e g factor

which agreed precisely with Land´e’s empirical expression discussed in Sect. 7.4 and given
by (7.31). Finally, he showed that the theory also gave Kronig’s results for the relative
intensities of the multiplets and their components in a weak magnetic ﬁeld.
The fourth paper was his short contribution On quantum algebra to the Mathematical
Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (Dirac, 1926b). This was a formal
description of the algebra of q-numbers stated axiomatically and concisely. It summarises
in one paper the necessary formalities for the application of quantum algebra to physics at
the quantum level.
Dirac submitted his PhD dissertation with the title Quantum mechanics in May 1926,
including in it the four papers discussed in this chapter (Dirac, 1926a). This was a remarkable
achievement in that it provided a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum mechanics,
all discovered in the previous nine months. The examiners included Arthur Eddington and
they were very impressed by the dissertation. In June 1926, Eddington took the unusual step
of writing personally to Dirac to congratulate him warmly on his remarkable achievement
(Farmelo, 2009).
This brought to a close Dirac’s ﬁrst burst of creativity in developing the fundamentals
of quantum theory. Soon, he was to add the quite different approach pioneered by Erwin
Schr¨odinger to his armoury of weapons for attacking the problems of quantum theory.

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
On 13 March 1926, the ﬁrst of six papers on wave mechanics by Erwin Schr¨odinger was
published in the Annalen der Physik with the title Quantisation as an eigenvalue problem
(Part 1)1 (Schr¨odinger, 1926b). The startling ﬁrst paragraph reads:
‘In this paper, I wish to consider, ﬁrst, the simple case of the hydrogen atom (non-
relativistic and unperturbed), and show that the customary quantum conditions can be
replaced by another postulate, in which the concept of “whole numbers”, merely as such,
is not introduced. Rather, when integralness does appear, it arises in the same natural way
as it does in the case of node-numbers of a vibrating string. The new conception is capable
of generalisation, and strikes, I believe, very deeply at the true nature of quantum rules.’
These papers were the fruits of an extraordinary burst of creativity on Schr¨odinger’s part
which resulted from his interactions with Einstein in the latter part of 1925. Central to
these exchanges were de Broglie’s remarkable researches which culminated in his famous
PhD dissertation and published papers of 1924. These events have already be recounted in
Chap. 9. The subsequent developments which led to Schr¨odinger’s discovery of the equation
which bears his name will be taken up in Sect. 14.2, but let us ﬁrst understand more about
Schr¨odinger’s background.
14.1 Schr¨odinger’s background in physics and mathematics
14.1.1 Education and career up to 1925
Unlike Heisenberg, Jordan, Pauli and Dirac, Erwin Schr¨odinger was not one of the young
Turks who developed Knabenphysik, young man’s physics. In 1926, they were all aged
about 25, while Schr¨odinger was 38, more or less of the same generation as Born who was
ﬁve years his senior. Schr¨odinger was born in 1887 in Vienna, which had become a leading
centre for experimental and theoretical physics in the latter years of the nineteenth century.
In 1866, Josef Stefan had become director of the Physical Institute of the University of
Vienna where his doctoral students included Ludwig Boltzmann, Marian Smoluchowski
and Johann Josef Loschmidt. In turn, Stefan and Boltzmann were the teachers of Friedrich
Hasen¨ohrl who was to succeed Boltzmann as Professor of Theoretical Physics at the
University of Vienna. Hasen¨ohrl was the only Austrian to participate in the 1911 Solvay
Conference on quanta. Following his tenure of the Chair of Physics at Prague, Ernst Mach
returned to the University of Vienna in 1895 as Professor of Philosophy. The stage was set

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
for the vehement debates between Boltzmann and Mach on the reality of the existence of
atoms.
Schr¨odinger began his university studies in 1906 as the community of Viennese scientists
was coming to terms with the tragedy of Boltzmann’s suicide in September of that year.
Schr¨odinger studied physics at the University of Vienna between 1906 and 1910 under Franz
Exner in experimental physics and Hasen¨ohrl in theoretical physics. He was recognised as
an outstanding student and, following a year’s military service, became an assistant at
Exner’s Physical Institute in 1911. Having obtained his Habilitation in January 1914, he
was appointed a Privatdozent at the University of Vienna where he carried out a wide range
of studies in both experimental and theoretical physics.
During the First World War, Schr¨odinger participated in the war effort as a commissioned
ofﬁcer in the Austrian fortress artillery. Tragically, Hasen¨ohrl was killed during the hostili-
ties in October 1915. Later, on receiving the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1933, Schr¨odinger
wrote in his autobiographical notes,
‘At that time, Hasen¨ohrl was killed in battle, and I feel that otherwise today his name
would now stand in place of mine.’ (Schr¨odinger, 1935)
In 1917, still on military duty, he returned to Vienna as an instructor in meteorology for
anti-aircraft ofﬁcer-candidates. He was able to continue his researches during the War years,
producing 10 scientiﬁc papers on a variety of themes. In 1919, he completed what was to
prove to be his last paper on experimental physics – from this time onwards, his scientiﬁc
papers were entirely of a theoretical nature.
With the collapse and breakup of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the First
World War and the poor prospects of obtaining a position in Austria, Schr¨odinger decided
that his future lay in Germany and in the spring of 1920 he became the assistant to Max Wien,
the brother of Wilhelm (Willy) Wien, at the University of Jena. This was the beginning
of a period of continuous transfer between one university and another as he moved up
the academic ladder. In September 1920, he was appointed an extraordinary Professor of
Theoretical Physics at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart and then in the spring of
1921 to an ordinary professorship at the University of Breslau. Finally, in October 1921 he
was called to the Professorship of Theoretical Physics at the University of Z¨urich where
he was to remain for the next six years – during this period he carried out his pioneering
researches in wave mechanics.
14.1.2 Scientific accomplishments up to 1925
Schr¨odinger had received a very thorough training in experimental and theoretical physics at
the University of Vienna. The most inﬂuential of his teachers was Hasen¨orhl whose excellent
lectures included the foundations of analytic mechanics, the dynamics of deformable bodies,
special attention being paid to the solution of partial differential equations and eigenvalue
problems, as well as Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic theory, optics, thermodynamics
and statistical mechanics. It is striking that Schr¨odinger’s interests in physics spanned a
very wide range of topics, whilst the problems of quantum physics occupied a relatively
minor role in his early work. He published papers on the kinetic theory of magnetism, on

14.2 Einstein, De Broglie and Schr¨odinger
dielectrics and anomalous dispersion, atmospheric electricity and the origin of penetrating
radiation. The last topic preceded the discovery in 1912 of the cosmic radiation by Victor
Hess, who was ﬁrst assistant to Stefan Meyer, director of the Institut f¨ur Radiumforschung in
Vienna (Hess, 1913). Schr¨odinger had worked on the height dependence of the penetrating
radiation assuming it originated in the Earth – Hess showed conclusively that the radiation
was extraterrestrial and made reference to Schr¨odinger’s paper in his article.
More germane to the present story was Schr¨odinger’s research on the atomic structure of
solids. Following the pioneering researches on the speciﬁc heat capacities at low tempera-
tures by Einstein and Debye, the lattice theory of the structure of solids had been the subject
of important papers by Born and von K´arm´an (Born and von K´arm´an, 1912). This work
was elaborated theoretically by Schr¨odinger in his ﬁrst important paper under the title On
the dynamics of elastically coupled point systems (Schr¨odinger, 1914). The theory required
the use of advanced methods in the eigenvalue theory for inﬁnite systems, but this posed
little difﬁculty for him because of his training in theoretical physics under Hasen¨orhl. In
his courses, Hasen¨ohrl had treated
‘the higher theoretical schemes of mechanics as well as the problem of eigenvalues in
continuum physics.’ (Schr¨odinger, 1935)
During the War years, Schr¨odinger studied Smoluchowski’s theory of ﬂuctuations and
general relativity. Towards the end of the War, he wrote a substantial review of atomic
and molecular speciﬁc heats which necessarily involved the introduction of quantisation to
understand their low temperature behaviour (Schr¨odinger, 1919). He continued his broad
interests in physics and other disciplines such as the theory of colours and colour perception.
He maintained an interest in quantum problems, for example, in his paper on penetrating
orbits which was discussed in Sect. 8.2 and which dates from his short stay at Stuttgart
(Schr¨odinger, 1921), but he was not one of the main protagonists of quantum theory. It
therefore came as a complete surprise when Schr¨odinger discovered wave mechanics which
at ﬁrst sight was a completely different approach from the technically complex methods
developed in G¨ottingen, Copenhagen and Cambridge. Let us trace the steps which led to
Schr¨odinger’s dramatic discovery of his wave equation.
14.2 Einstein, De Broglie and Schr¨odinger
The deep signiﬁcance of Bose’s famous paper of 1924 was fully appreciated by Einstein.
It described a new type of statistics for counting photons which resulted in an elegant
derivation of the spectrum of black-body radiation. Einstein realised that the counting
procedures for indistinguishable particles could be applied equally well to atoms as to
photons. The procedures described in Sec. 9.2 led to the expression (9.7) for the number of
particles in the state k

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
where the constants α and β are to be determined and gk is the degeneracy of the energy
level with energy εk for photons or atoms. On thermodynamic grounds, β = 1/kT and α
is determined by ﬁxing the number of photons or atoms. For black-body radiation, α is
set equal to zero, meaning that the photon number is not conserved, but that the number
density of photons is matched to the total energy under the black-body spectrum – the
properties of the black-body spectrum are uniquely deﬁned by the single parameter T , the
thermodynamic temperature of the radiation.
Einstein carried out an exactly parallel analysis for the atoms of a monatomic gas, but
now the numbers of particles had to be conserved and so α had to be a non-zero constant.
The same statistical procedures as in Sect. 9.2 (Einstein, 1924) were used. The total number
of available states in momentum space is given by (9.9), but now the momenta of the atoms
of the gas are given by p2 = 2mE, rather than by p = hν/c. Therefore, the volume of
phase space for a monatomic gas is
V dpx dpy dpz = V 4πp2 dp ,
(14.2)
where p = (2mE)1/2, dp = 1
2(2mE)−1/2 × 2m dE and V is the physical volume within
which the gas is contained. Since the elementary volume of momentum space is h3, the
number of available states with energy in the interval E to E + dE in the volume V is
gk = V 4πp2 dp
h3
,
(14.3)
and so the number of particles in the energy interval E to E + dE is
N(E) dE =
gk
eα+βE −1 = 4πV (2m3E)1/2
h3 
eα+βE −1
 dE .
(14.4)
In the limit of very low densities and high temperatures, (14.4) becomes the standard
Boltzmann distribution and so β = 1/kT . We can therefore write
N(E) dE =
gk

BeE/kT −1
 = 4πV (2m3E)1/2
h3 
BeE/kT −1
 dE ,
(14.5)
where B = eα.
Einstein fully appreciated the remarkable properties of this new distribution (Einstein,
1924, 1925). B cannot be less than one or else the number of particles could become
negative and so B ≥1. When B is very close to 1, the number of particles in low energy
states can become very large. In fact, the effect is much more dramatic than this, as Einstein
demonstrated in his second paper. A version of Einstein’s analysis is given in the endnotes.2
What had gone wrong was that the continuum approximation (14.3), in which gi was
replaced by N(E) dE, does not take account of the fact that the zero energy quantised
state can contain a ﬁnite number of particles. The quantisation of the states, which results
in a ground state with zero energy, has to be included in the calculation. At low enough
temperatures, T < TB, where

14.2 Einstein, De Broglie and Schr¨odinger
the particles accumulated in the zero energy state and, as T →0, all the particles would
be condensed into the same zero energy state. This is the origin of the phenomenon of the
Bose–Einstein condensation. The gas is split into two parts, the ‘normal phase’ in which
the particles are distributed among the excited energy states and the ‘condensed phase’ in
which all the remaining atoms of the gas are in the quantised ground state. At low enough
energies, essentially all the particles would be in this condensed phase. Although it was
not appreciated at the time, this was the ﬁrst realisation of a phase transition using the
techniques of statistical mechanics of identical particles.3
Einstein appreciated fully that Bose’s statistics were very different from classical Boltz-
mann statistics. The key difference is that the particles can no longer be considered to be
statistically independent. As explained in Sect. 9.2, since the particles are indistinguishable,
each possible conﬁguration is counted only once. In Boltzmann statistics the conﬁgurations
[A|B] and [B|A] are considered as separate realisations of the distribution of distinguishable
particles, whereas according to Bose–Einstein statistics, if A and B are indistinguishable,
they are counted only once. This induces a statistical correlation between the particles. In
his second paper on the Bose–Einstein gas, Einstein was quite clear about the strange nature
of the new statistics (Einstein, 1925):
‘[It] therefore expresses indirectly a certain hypothesis about a mutual dependence of the
molecules, which for the present is of a totally enigmatic nature and which just creates
the same statistical probability for the cases which are deﬁned here as complexions.’
There were two other suggestive features of the distribution to which Einstein drew
attention. First, the new distribution was consistent with Nernst’s heat theorem, or the third
law of thermodynamics, according to which the entropy of all gases tends to zero at zero
temperature. This is indeed the case for a Bose–Einstein distribution, but not for a classical
Boltzmann distribution.
Secondly, just as in the case of black-body radiation, the ﬂuctuations in the number
density of particles is composed of two parts. The fractional ﬂuctuation for photons is
given by (3.41) and a similar relation is found for the monatomic gas,
ν
nν
2
= 1
nν
+ 1
zν
,
(14.7)
where nν is the mean number of atoms and zν is the number of cells in phase space with
energies in the interval E to E + dE. The ﬁrst term is the usual statistical ﬂuctuation in
the number of particles according to a Poisson distribution, N/N ≈N −1/2. The sec-
ond term arises from ﬂuctuations associated with the superposition of random waves, as
was demonstrated in Sect. 3.6.2. Again, Einstein fully appreciated the signiﬁcance of this
result:
‘It arises in the case of radiation from interference ﬂuctuations. We may also interpret
it for gases in a corresponding way by associating with the gas, in a suitable manner, a
ray phenomenon and then computing the interference ﬂuctuations of the latter.’ (Einstein,
1925)
He went on to remark that

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
‘I pursue this interpretation further, since I believe that here we have to do with more than
a mere analogy.’
In December 1924, Einstein had been sent a copy of de Broglie’s doctoral thesis by
Langevin, who had been one of its examiners. Einstein was profoundly impressed, referring
to it as ‘a very notable publication’. In his paper of 1925, he suggested that the type of
matter waves proposed by de Broglie enabled him to interpret the ﬂuctuation term in (14.7)
for the Bose–Einstein gas and repeated de Broglie’s suggestion that experiments might be
carried out to search for the interference of matter waves in beams of particles, although
he realised that the effect would be extremely small. The subsequent story of the discovery
of electron diffraction by Davisson and George Thomson was recounted in Sect. 9.4, but
these results were not established at the time when Schr¨odinger began to take matter waves
seriously.
Schr¨odinger’s correspondence with Einstein began in February 1925 when he was study-
ing the various expressions for the entropy of an ideal gas at low temperatures. Having
studied Einstein’s ﬁrst paper on the equation of state of an ideal gas, he wrote to Einstein
about his concern that the particle distribution according to Bose–Einstein statistics was
inconsistent with the Boltzmann distribution. Einstein responded by stating that his concern
was indeed valid, but there was nothing wrong with his calculation. As Einstein wrote,
‘Your reproach is not unjustiﬁed, although I have not made a mistake in my paper. In
Bose statistics, which I use, the quanta or molecules are not considered as being mutually
independent objects.’
Schr¨odinger delayed replying until November 1925 when he confessed that he had not
appreciated the originality of Einstein’s paper. In particular, he was intrigued by the new
light it shed upon quantum degeneracy.
In the same letter, Schr¨odinger makes his ﬁrst reference to de Broglie’s thesis (de Broglie,
1924a). He had been intrigued by Einstein’s reference to it in his second paper on Bose–
Einstein statistics (Einstein, 1925) and only obtained a copy of it in late summer 1925.
He discussed the thesis with Pieter Debye, his colleague at Zurich, who suggested that
Schr¨odinger present a colloquium on de Broglie’s ideas. This duly took place in late
November or early December 1925. According to Felix Bloch,
‘When he had ﬁnished, Debye casually remarked that he thought this way of talking was
rather childish. As a student of Sommerfeld, he had learned that, to deal properly with
waves, one had to have a wave equation. It sounded quite trivial and did not seem to
make a great impression, but Schr¨odinger evidently thought a bit more about the idea
afterwards.’ (Bloch, 1976)
Just a few weeks later, Schr¨odinger gave another colloquium in which he is reported to have
begun with the following words:
‘My colleague Debye suggested that one should have a wave equation; well, I have found
one.’
This was the discovery of Schr¨odinger’s wave equation for the hydrogen atom.

14.3 The relativistic Schr¨odinger wave equation
14.3 The relativistic Schr¨odinger wave equation
In seeking a wave equation to describe de Broglie’s matter waves, Schr¨odinger began by
attempting to ﬁnd an appropriate relativistic wave equation. The reason is clear from the
fact that, as demonstrated in Sect. 9.3, de Broglie used extensively relativistic arguments
to ﬁnd a self-consistent description of the phase relations of the matter waves and the
kinematics of the electron. These ﬁrst attempts at the derivation of the relativistic wave
equation were never published, but the argument can be traced in Schr¨odinger’s notebooks
and a three-page memorandum he wrote on the eigenvibrations of the hydrogen atom. This
ﬁrst attempt was to be superseded by his ﬁrst non-relativistic paper on wave mechanics
(Mehra and Rechenberg, 1987).
Schr¨odinger was seeking a time-independent wave equation which would have the stan-
dard form
ψ + k2ψ = 0 ,
(14.8)
where k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber of the wave. u = ω/k is the phase velocity of the wave
and, in his dissertation, de Broglie had shown that u is the superluminal velocity u = c2/v,
where v is the speed of the electron (Sect. 9.3). Schr¨odinger therefore made the following
identiﬁcation:
u = c2
v = γ mec2
γ mev = E
p =
hν
γ m0v .
(14.9)
In place of de Broglie’s relation E = hν = γ mec2, Schr¨odinger includes the electrostatic
potential energy so that
hν = γ m0c2 −
e2
4πϵ0r .
(14.10)
These expressions were rearranged to eliminate the velocity v of the electron so that

(14.12)
Using the relation k = 2πν/u and substituting for u into the wave equation (14.8) using

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
As we will see, this equation is of the same form as the non-relativistic wave
equation.
Schr¨odinger was now on home ground and knew exactly how to treat (14.13) as an
eigenfunction problem. All he had to do was to follow the standard procedure of separating
variables in spherical harmonic coordinates, namely ψ(r, θ, φ) = R(r) (θ) (φ), and ap-
ply the appropriate boundary conditions. The functions (θ) and (φ) could be expressed
by the standard angular functions for m ≥0

R = 0 .
(14.16)
Schr¨odinger, after a bit of effort, solved this equation and found quantised energy levels,
but the solution was not quite right. He was well aware of the fact that one of the triumphs
of the old quantum theory had been Sommerfeld’s relativistic model for the hydrogen
atom which was discussed in Sect. 5.3. The issue is illustrated by the analysis of Mehra
and Rechenberg (1987) who show that the solutions for the constants A and B can be
written in equivalent form in terms of the quantities A′ and B′ for both the Sommerfeld
and Heisenberg solutions as follows:
Sommerfeld :

The constants A′ and B′ determine the energies of the stationary states of the electron in
the hydrogen atom and Sommerfeld’s expression (5.36) was in excellent agreement with
experiment. The extra factors of 1
2 in Schr¨odinger’s expression spoiled that agreement and
would require the introduction of half-integral quantum numbers. This was a discourage-
ment for Schr¨odinger and he set the problem aside for a brief period while he completed
other pieces of writing. Although it was not understood at the time, what had gone wrong
was that, as soon as a relativistic theory of the hydrogen atom is adopted, the spin of the
electron has to be included. This was, however, a signiﬁcant piece of analysis – it was the
ﬁrst time a wave equation for the electron in the atom had been introduced into quantum
physics. Notice that de Broglie’s waves were propagating waves whereas Schr¨odinger had
converted the problem into one of standing waves, like the vibrations of a violin string under
tension.

14.4.1 Preliminaries
Schr¨odinger spent the Christmas break of 1925–1926 at the Villa Herwig at Arosa where
he intended to relax and enjoy the skiing. His mind was, however, consumed by his recent
researches at the expense of what should have been a period of relaxation. As he noted in
a letter to Willy Wien of 27 December 1925,
‘At the moment I am plagued by a new atomic theory . . . I believe I can write down a
vibrating system – constructed in a comparatively natural manner and not by ad hoc
assumptions – which has as its eigenfrequencies the term frequencies of the hydrogen
atom.’
His notebooks show that the ﬁrst derivation of the non-relativistic wave equation for the
hydrogen atom was formulated during that holiday. In fact, the derivation was no more than
a straightforward simpliﬁcation of the relativistic wave equation discussed in Sect. 14.3. In
the non-relativistic case, (14.10) becomes
hν = mec2 + 1

(14.17)
and the phase velocity of the wave (14.9) becomes

velocity is obtained,

0h3c. This was a startling result – the
energies of the standing waves were exactly those of the stationary states of the hydrogen
atom and the differences in energies between them would result in Bohr’s formula for the
lines observed in the hydrogen spectrum.
Schr¨odinger still had a lot to do. In particular, he still had to solve (14.21) for the radial
dependence of ψ upon radius. He had with him Schlesinger’s textbook Introduction to the
Theory of Differential Equations (1900) and struggled to ﬁnd the solution. In fact, Courant
and Hilbert’s Methods of Mathematical Physics, Volume 1 had appeared in 1924 and gave
a solution to a similar equation in terms of Laguerre polynomials – the actual solution is
obtained using associated Laguerre polynomials, which appear in Part 3 of Schr¨odinger’s
papers of 1926 with the same title Quantisation as an eigenvalue problem (Schr¨odinger,
1926e).
14.4.2 The non-relativistic theory of the hydrogen atom
Within a few weeks, Schr¨odinger completed the ﬁrst of his great series of six papers and it
was received by the Annalen der Physik on 27 January 1926. The ideas and approach were
reﬁned with the striking feature that he devotes most of the arguments to the mathematical
requirements of the wave equation he had discovered, rather than relating the formalism
to the physics of the hydrogen atom, or quantum phenomena in general. He explains the
reason for this approach in the third section of his paper.
‘It is, of course, strongly suggested that we should try to connect the function ψ with
some vibration process in the atom, which would more nearly approach reality than the
electronic orbits, the real existence of which is being very much questioned today. I
originally intended to found the new quantum conditions in this more intuitive manner,
but ﬁnally gave them the above neutral mathematical form, because it brings more clearly
to light what is really essential. The essential thing seems to me to be, that the postulation

of “whole numbers” no longer enters into the quantum rules mysteriously, but that we
have traced the matter a step further back, and found the “integralness” to have its origin
in the ﬁniteness and single-valuedness of a certain space function.’
Schr¨odinger was to defer the more physical arguments to the second paper of the series.
His ﬁrst step was to rederive the wave equation (14.20) in a somewhat more formal
manner, starting from the Hamilton–Jacobi differential equation (5.86),
H

q, ∂S



(14.27)
which was derived in Sect. 5.4.4. He points out that the solutions for S are normally found
in terms of the sum of functions, each being a function of only one independent variable
qi. This was illustrated in the case of Sommerfeld’s analysis of the elliptical orbits in
the old quantum theory in Sect. 5.5. Rewriting (5.98) in our present notation in Cartesian
coordinates,

(14.28)
Now, in his analysis of the wave equation (14.20), Schr¨odinger had shown that the solution
should be sought in terms of the products of independent functions as illustrated by the
separation of variables which led to (14.21). In contrast, the analysis of Sect. 5.5 showed that
the solution is written as the sum of independent functions of the orthogonal coordinates
r, θ, φ. In Cartesian notation, (5.99) would be written
S = Sx(x) + Sy(y) + Sz(z) .
(14.29)
The solution is to write S as the logarithm of some function ψ such that S = K ln ψ. Then,
(14.27) can be written
H

(14.30)
He states that he is to apply this formalism to the non-relativistic case of the hydrogen atom.
Then comes the key to the new approach:
‘We now seek the function ψ, such that for any arbitrary variation of it the integral of
the said quadratic form, taken over the whole of coordinate space, is stationary, ψ being
everywhere real, single-valued, ﬁnite, and continuously differentiable up to second order.
The quantum conditions are replaced by this variation problem.’

This is the deﬁnitive version of Schr¨odinger’s time-independent wave equation for the
hydrogen atom.6 Most of the rest of the paper is concerned with a careful analysis of the
mathematical properties of the wave equation (14.37).
First of all, Schr¨odinger recognised that, because of the spherical symmetry of the
problem, spherical polar coordinates were the natural system to adopt. He sought solutions in
these coordinates by separation of variables, ψ = R(r) (θ) (φ), the functions Y(θ, φ) =
(θ) (φ) being the usual spherical harmonics given by (14.14) and (14.15). The key
feature of these functions is that, in order that the spherical harmonics are single-valued,
l can only take positive integral values l ≥0 while m can only take integral values in the
range −l ≤m ≤l. The spherical harmonics form a complete, orthogonal set of functions
so that any distribution on a sphere can be decomposed into the sum of spherical harmonics.

where l = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . Schr¨odinger now carries out a detailed analysis of the properties of
acceptable solutions of this equation, paying particular attention to the issues of singularities
at r = 0 and r = ∞. The solutions are found in terms of Laplace transformations and are
characterised by the quantity

(14.39)
He then establishes the following results – the italics are Schr¨odinger’s:
1. [(14.38)] has, for every positive E, solutions which are everywhere single-valued, ﬁnite,
and continuous; and which tend to zero as 1/r at inﬁnity under continual oscillations.
2. For negative values of E which do not satisfy the condition [that (14.39) takes integral
values] our variation problem has no solution.
3. For negative values of E, our variation problem has solutions, if and only if, E satisﬁes
the condition

(14.40)
where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
4. There are no solutions of the problem if l ≥n. Only values smaller than n (and there
is always one such at our disposal) can be given to the integer l, which denotes the
order of the surface harmonic appearing in the equation.
The energies of the stationary states can now be found from (14.40) and are
En = −mee4
8ϵ2
0n2h2 .
(14.41)
These are precisely the energies of the stationary states of the electron in the hydrogen
atom.
Schr¨odinger fully appreciated the signiﬁcance of these calculations. Immediately after
his derivation of the energies of the stationary states of the hydrogen atom, he explains the
signiﬁcance of the quantum numbers – I have translated the quantum numbers into modern
usage.
‘Our n is the principal quantum number. l + 1 is analogous to the azimuthal quantum
number. The splitting up of this number through a closer deﬁnition of the surface harmonic
can be compared with the resolution of the azimuthal quantum number into an “equatorial”
and “polar” quantum. These numbers here deﬁne the system of nodes-lines on the sphere.
Also the “radial quantum number” n −l −1 gives exactly the number of the “node-
spheres”, for it is easily established that the function [R(r)] has exactly n −l −1 positive
real roots. The positive E-values correspond to the continuum of hyperbolic orbits, to
which one may ascribe, in a certain sense, the radial quantum number ∞.’
He also notes that the amplitudes of the standing wave solutions for R(r) tend to zero at
radii greater than an/n, where an is the corresponding Bohr–Sommerfeld value for the
semi-major axis of the classical elliptical orbits.

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
14.4.3 Reflections
Schr¨odinger realised the importance of these calculations in providing insight into the
nature of quantisation. Close to the end of his paper, he writes:
‘It is hardly necessary to emphasise how much more congenial it would be to imagine
that at a quantum transition the energy changes from one form of vibration to another,
than to think of a jumping electron. The changing of the vibration form can take place
continuously in space and time, and it can readily last as long as the emission process
lasts empirically.’
He had made the remarkable discovery that quantisation can be introduced into the de-
scription of quantum phenomena through the essential requirement that the wavefunction
ψ should be everywhere real, single-valued, ﬁnite, and continuously differentiable up to
second order. As he emphasised, the somewhat arbitrary quantum conditions of the old
quantum theory are replaced by these constraints on the properties of the wavefunction.
The paper gives the impression of being written in the white heat of inspiration –
Schr¨odinger realises that there are many loose ends to be tied up, but he was driven to
publish his discovery in an almost unvarnished form. He fully acknowledges the importance
of de Broglie’s papers:
‘Above all, I wish to mention that I was led to these deliberations in the ﬁrst place by the
suggestive papers of M. Louis de Broglie (de Broglie, 1924a), . . . ’
It is perfectly understandable that he should give the highest priority to publishing his
wave equation, without going into a more thorough examination of his intellectual break-
through. Still working at breakneck speed, his next paper Quantisation as an eigenvalue
problem (Part 2) was received by the Annalen der Physik on 23 February 1926. Part 2 might
more logically have preceded Part 1 since it provides a deeper insight into how the wave
equation can be formulated as an extension of the principles of Fermat and Hamilton. The
analysis of that paper is our next task.
14.5 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part2)
Schr¨odinger’s second paper was concerned with providing a more formal basis for his
wave equation and providing further examples of its application (Schr¨odinger, 1926c).
The attempt to place Lagrangian mechanics and physical optics on the same formal basis
had been pioneered by Hamilton, inspired by Lagrange’s approach to classical mechanics
and Fresnel’s success in developing the wave theory of optics to describe diffraction and
interference phenomena. Hamilton’s objective was no less than to provide a single uniﬁed
theory which would describe both the motion of particles and the propagation of light rays
(Hamilton, 1833). He achieved this by showing that his characteristic function S, introduced
in Sect. 5.4, could be applied to both the dynamics of particles and the paths of light
rays.

14.5 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part2)
14.5.1 The fundamentals of undulatory mechanics
For light rays, Fermat’s principle of least time states that the path of a light ray is that which
minimises the time between the source of light and its detection through a medium in which
the refractive index n varies with position
δ
 n
c dl = 0 ,
(14.42)
where c is the speed of light and dl is the element of distance. Snell’s law of refraction,
n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2, follows immediately from the geometrical application of the principle,
where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the medium and the angles θ1 and θ2 are the
angles of incidence and refraction of the ray relative to the normal to the surface.
The analogue of Fermat’s principle for mechanical systems can be readily derived from
Maupertuis’ principle, historically the ﬁrst of the variational principles, and a variant of the
principle of least action. In the present instance, we are only interested in cases in which the
time does not appear explicitly so that neither the Lagrangian nor the Hamiltonian depend
upon time, in other words, the systems involve conservative ﬁelds of force. In terms of
general coordinates, the Hamiltonian H(p, q) = E = constant.
Landau and Lifshitz (1976) demonstrate that, under these conditions, Maupertuis’ prin-
ciple can be written
δS0 = 0
where
S0 =
 
i
pi dqi ,
(14.43)
where pi and qi are the generalised coordinates introduced in Sect. 5.4.3, with pi = ∂L/∂˙qi.
Schr¨odinger uses the principle in its simplest form in which pi is the Cartesian momentum
p = mv and q the position coordinate. Then the trajectory of a particle is given by that path
for which the minimisation condition is

(14.44)
where T is the kinetic energy.7 Expression (14.44) was to be the starting point for
Schr¨odinger’s next attack on the fundamentals of what he called in this paper undula-
tory mechanics.
Starting from Maupertuis’ principle (14.44), dt can be replaced by dl/v where v is
the velocity of the particle. Since the kinetic energy of the particle is 1

principle becomes
δ

n
⇛
C
[2m(E −U)]1/2 ,
(14.47)
where C is a constant. Jammer (1989) refers to this equivalence as Hamilton’s optical-
mechanical analogy.
Hamilton took the analogy further. Hamilton’s action function is deﬁned to be S =
 t
t0 L dt, where L = (T −U) is the Lagrangian, and deﬁnes an action surface S(x, y, z, t) =
constant. The properties of the action surface are directly related to the dynamics of the
particles of the system. From the action function, the following relations can be derived, as
demonstrated in the endnotes.8 The momentum and total energy of the particle are given
by
p = ∇S
and
∂S
∂t = L −pv = −E ,
(14.48)
where E is the constant total energy for motion under conservative forces. The corre-
sponding equations for the wavefront of a wave of the form exp(iφ) = exp [i(k · r −ωt)]
are
k = ∇φ
and
∂φ
∂t = −ω ,
(14.49)
where φ is the phase factor of the wave and ω = 2πν. Comparing (14.48) and (14.49),
the surfaces of constant action of a system of particles are the exact analogues of the
surfaces of constant phase for optical waves. In addition, the wavevector k is the analogue
of the momentum p and the angular frequency ω the analogue of the energy E of the
particle. These insights, published by Hamilton between 1828 and 1837 (Hamilton, 1931),
were far ahead of their time. The formal analogy was apparent, but there was no obvious
interpretation of the velocity v as a wave velocity. With the exception of few theorists, such
as Felix Klein, Hamilton’s optical-mechanical analogy was neglected until Schr¨odinger
brought the concept to the forefront of quantum theory in 1926.
In his second paper, Schr¨odinger emphasises that Fermat’s principle in optics and Hamil-
ton’s principle in mechanics provide the classical equivalence of ray optics and particle
mechanics. Fermat’s principle makes no reference to the wave nature of light. In contrast,
the variational procedures for wave motion were deeply embedded in Fresnel’s approach
to wave optics and so there should be a parallel wave equivalence for particle motion.
Classical ray optics works extremely well, provided the scale of the system is large com-
pared with the wavelength of light. It breaks down, however, when the wavelength is of the
order of scale of the system, giving rise to the characteristic diffraction and interference
phenomena. Schr¨odinger postulates that the same should be true for particle mechanics.
Classical mechanics works very well, provided the scale of the system is very much greater
than the typical scale over which quantum phenomena are observed. On the atomic scale,
however, the wave properties of matter cannot be neglected if the scale of the system is of
the same order as the de Broglie wavelength, λ = h/p, where p is the momentum of the
particle.

Schr¨odinger’s visualisation of the motion of the action surface defined by S =
 t
t0 L dt, where L = T −U is the
Lagrangian (Schr¨odinger, 1926c).
Schr¨odinger ﬁrst discusses the dynamics of the particle in terms of the motion of the
action surface and shows that its normal velocity is
v =
E
0
2m(E −U)
.
(14.50)
His pictorial representation of the motion of the action surface is shown in Fig. 14.1. We
can derive this relation directly from the equivalences discovered by Hamilton between
the velocity of the action surface and that of a wavefront, (14.49) and (14.50) respectively.
Thus, the phase velocity of the wave or action surface is

The problem which faced Hamilton and the nineteenth century theorists was that (14.50)
is not the velocity of the particle which is
vpart =
0
2m(E −U)
m
.
(14.52)
This was the principal reason why Hamilton’s insights were neglected.
Schr¨odinger realised, however, that, according to undulatory mechanics, the expression
(14.51) corresponded to a dispersion relation for standing waves associated with the sta-
tionary states of the electron in the atom. The energy of the stationary state is E = ¯hω and
so (14.52) becomes

This is precisely the expression for the velocity of the particle. Note also that vphvgr =

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
This reasoning is similar to de Broglie’s arguments which were developed in detail in
Sect. 9.3. In particular, the importance of distinguishing the de Broglie waves which move
with the phase velocity and the particle velocity which travels at the group velocity of
the superposition of these waves is demonstrated in the expressions (9.15) and (9.16).
Schr¨odinger explicitly recognises that this is precisely the insight provided by de Broglie,
writing
‘We ﬁnd here again a theorem for the “phase waves” of the electron, which M. de Broglie
had derived, with essential reference to the relativity theory, in those ﬁne researches [(de
Broglie, 1924b)] to which I owe the inspiration for this work.’
Sch¨odinger devotes considerable attention and caution to the formal underpinning of
undulatory mechanics according to the precepts of Hamilton–Jacobi theory and then adopts
the simplest means of formulating the wave equation. The standard wave equation for ψ
can be written
∇2ψ −1
v2
ph
¨ψ = 0 .
(14.55)
Time-independent solutions are sought in which the wavefunction ψ depends upon time as
exp(iωt) = exp(i2πνt) and so
∇2ψ + ω2
v2
ph
ψ = 0 .
(14.56)
Now substituting (14.52) for vph and recalling that E = hν, we ﬁnd
∇2ψ + 8π2m
h2
(E −U)ψ = 0 ,
or
∇2ψ + 8π2m
h2
(hν −U)ψ = 0 .
(14.57)
These equations are exactly the same as the wave equation (14.37) derived in his ﬁrst paper.
Schr¨odinger is duly cautious about the uniqueness of this equation, but argues on grounds of
simplicity that it will be adopted as the wave equation for describing quantum phenomena.
He also notes that, as a partial differential equation, very large numbers of solutions are
possible. Although the quantum relation E = hν has been introduced, the quantisation
of the energy levels of atomic systems is not bolted on arbitrarily, but is determined by
the boundary conditions needed to satisfy the requirements that the function ψ must be
single-valued, ﬁnite and continuous throughout conﬁguration space. He had applied these
concepts in Part 1 and now he gives further examples of the power of these methods.
14.5.2 Applications
The solution of Schr¨odinger’s wave equation for the hydrogen atom was a truly impressive
feat and now he extended the concepts to the problems which had already been treated with
success by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926). By the time he was working on Part 2
of his series of papers, he had discovered Courant and Hilbert’s Methods of Mathematical
Physics (1924) and was bowled over by its contents. In an enthusiastic letter to Wien of 22
February 1926, he writes:

14.5 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part2)
‘Time is ﬂying. Each second or third day brings with it a small novelty – it works, not
I, and that “It” is the magniﬁcent classical mathematics and Hilbert’s mathematics, the
wonderful ediﬁce of eigenvalues. These unfold everything so clearly before us, that all
we have to do is take it, without any labour and bothering; because the correct method
is provided in time, as soon as one needs it, completely automatically. I am so happy
to have escaped from terrible mechanics, including its action and angle variables and
the perturbation theory, which I have never really understood. Now everything becomes
linear, everything can be superposed; one computes as easily and comfortably as in good
old acoustics. Even perturbation theory [in the new mechanics] is not more complicated
than [considering] the forced vibrations of a string.’
This remarkable coincidence of the appearance of Courant and Hilbert’s book and the
immediate application of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to wave mechanics was one of
the reasons for Schr¨odinger’s amazingly rapid progress in 1926.
The Planck oscillator
The ﬁrst new application was to the harmonic oscillator, referred to as the Planck oscillator
because of its fundamental role in Planck’s pioneering paper of 1900. Writing the kinetic
and potential energy terms for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator as T = 1
2m ˙x2 and
U = 1

Changing the notation to a = 8π2mE/h2 and b = 4π2m2ω2
0/h2, this equation becomes
d2ψ
dx2 + (a −bx2)ψ = 0 .
(14.59)
Changing variables to y = xb1/4, the equation is reduced to a standard form

(14.60)
Eigenfunction solutions for this equation had been presented in Courant and Hilbert’s
Methods of Mathematical Physics (1924). The eigenvalues can only take the values a/
√
b =
1, 3, 5, . . . , (2n + 1), . . . and the eigenfunctions are
ψ(y) = e−y2/2 Hn(y) ,
(14.61)
where Hn(y) are the orthogonal Hermite polynomials, the ﬁrst few of which are
H0(y) = 1
H1(y) = 2y
H2(y) = 4y2 −2
H3(y) = 8y3 −12y
H4(y) = 16y4 −48y2 + 12

From the deﬁnitions of a and b, the eigenvalues are therefore

(14.63)
This striking relation is identical to Heisenberg’s results obtained from the matrix mechanics
approach to quantum phenomena. Schr¨odinger was also able to derive the forms of the
eigenfunctions, to which we will return in the next section. He was well aware of the
fact that the solution included the zero point energy, 1
2hν0, and that it is observed in
measurements of the frequencies of band edges (see Sects. 11.5 and 12.5).
Rotator with a fixed axis
In this case, the energy is entirely in the kinetic energy of rotation of the rotator and the only
variable is the phase φ of the angle of rotation. For this rotational motion, the equivalence
with the linear motion of the electron in a harmonic oscillator is
1
2m ˙x2 ≡1
2 I ˙φ2 ,
m ≡I ,
x ≡φ .
(14.64)
Therefore, the wave equation becomes

(14.66)
The quantisation arises from the requirement that the wavefunction be single-valued and
continuous and so (8π2I/h2)1/2 = 1, 2, 3, . . . , and the quantised energy levels of the
rotator are
En = n2h2
8π2I ,
(14.67)
in agreement with previous quantum arguments.
Rigid rotator with free axes
In this case, the motion of the rotator is constrained such that the ends of any diameter
lie on the surface of a sphere. Therefore, the wave equation has to be written in spherical
polar coordinates. The kinetic energy in the θ and φ directions is written in terms of the
angular momentum about the iθ and iφ directions. Since T = 1
2m(v2
θ + v2
φ) and the angular
momenta about these axes are Lθ = mrvθ and Lφ = mr sin θ vφ,

14.6 Wave-packets
where there is no radial dependence since the circumference of the rotator is constrained
to lie on the surface of a ﬁxed sphere – the Laplacian operator can only depend upon the
polar angles θ and φ. The solution is sought by the usual procedure of separating variables,
ψ = (θ) (φ), and then the quantisation condition enters from the requirement that the
functions (θ) and (φ) are continuous and single valued on the surface of the sphere.
These conditions lead to the requirement that only discrete values of the angular quantum
numbers are possible so that the energy eigenvalues are
El = l(l + 1)h2
8π2I
,
(14.70)
where l = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . Notice that we are using modern standard notation for the angular
momentum quantum number l, rather than Schr¨odinger’s n. This expression will be recog-
nised as the standard expression for the quantised energy levels of, for example, a diatomic
molecule.9
The non-rigid rotator – the diatomic molecule
In the ﬁnal part of his paper, Schr¨odinger tackles the problem of the rotating and vibrating
molecule. The problem now involves six degrees of freedom as well as harmonic coupling
between the two atoms of the diatomic molecule. We simply quote Schr¨odinger’s ﬁnal result
for the quantised energy levels:

√
1 + 3ϵ ,
(14.71)
where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and l = 0, 1, 2, . . . The small quantity
ϵ = l(l + 1)h2
16π4ν2
0 I 2
(14.72)
is the ratio of the rotational to vibrational energy of the molecule. Et is the molecule’s
translational energy. The second and third terms correspond to the quantised rotational
and vibrational energies and are the familiar terms with small corrections represented by
the small quantity ϵ for the coupling between the modes. Schr¨odinger recognised that this
calculation does not take account of the important deviations from a harmonic potential
for a more realistic model of interatomic forces. For this, perturbation solutions of the
wave equation are needed and the appropriate procedures were to be developed in Part 3 of
Schr¨odinger’s series of papers.

Schr¨odinger’s third paper, published on 9 July 1926, was a short note to Die Naturwis-
senschaften concerning the representation of an oscillator in undulatory mechanics by a
wave-packet, deﬁned by the superposition of the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator

(Schr¨odinger, 1926a). He summarises the results of the calculations for the wavefunctions
of the harmonic oscillator as follows:
ψn = e−y2/2 Hn(y) eiωnt ,
(14.73)
where ωn = (n + 1
2) ω0 and we have used the notation of Sect. 14.5.2. Hn(y) are the Hermite
polynomials and y = x√2πmω0/h. The functions (14.73) are normalised by multiplying
by (2nn!)−1/2 and these are referred to as Hermite’s orthogonal functions – the ﬁrst ﬁve
normalised wavefunctions are displayed in the range −3 ≤y ≤+3 in Fig. 14.2a, which is
taken from Schr¨odinger’s paper. Outside this range the wavefunctions decrease exponen-
tially to zero.
To create a wave-packet, Schr¨odinger adopts the complete set of eigenfunctions and
assumes that they are of large amplitude A ≫1. Then, he chooses the wave-packet to be
described by the following function
ψ =
∞

n=0

(14.74)
The signiﬁcance of (14.74) is that Hermite’s orthogonal functions (2nn!)−1/2ψn are weighted
by the factor An/
√
2nn!. The latter function can be compared with the function zn/n! which,
for large values of n has a sharp maximum at n = z. Thus, by weighting the eigenfunctions
with this factor, a narrow range of values of n is selected about the value n = A2/2. This
choice of weighting also has the advantage that the series (14.74) can be summed exactly

(14.77)
This is the remarkable ﬁnal result of Schr¨odinger’s calculation, one which was to usher in
a new approach to understanding the nature of physics at the quantum level. The solution
is illustrated in Fig. 14.2b. Schr¨odinger explains carefully the signiﬁcance of each term in
(14.77). The ﬁrst term in large square brackets is a Gaussian error-curve which is centred
at the position y = A cos ω0t. The width of the distribution is of order unity and so is small
compared with the amplitude of the oscillation of the error-curve along the y-axis. If we
now revert to the x-coordinate, the amplitude a of the oscillation is
a = A
0
h/2πmω0 ,
(14.78)
and so the classical energy of the oscillator, if the particle is assumed to have mass m,
is
Evib = 1
2ω2
0a2m = A2
2 ¯hω0 = n¯hω0 ,
(14.79)
exactly the mean energy of the oscillator which has the average quantum number n of
the group. Thus, the wave-packet represents the oscillation of a particle of mass m in the
quantum state n.
The second term in large square brackets in (14.78) represents the modulation of the
Gaussian error-curve by the ‘carrier’ signal, shown in Fig. 14.2b. The wave-packet oscillates
back and forward about y = 0, exactly as in the case of a harmonic oscillator. Schr¨odinger
notes the important point that, unlike normal wave-packets in which the waveform is
eventually broadened because of dispersion, there is no dispersion of the wave-packet
according to (14.77). We recall that the sum is an exact solution of the problem of the
oscillator and so there are no higher order corrections in the case of the Planck oscillator.
Another elementary example of the non-dispersive propagation of a wave-packet in wave
mechanics occurs in the case of the representation of a particle moving at constant speed
v, as illustrated in the endnote.10
The solution (14.78) for half an oscillation cycle is shown in Fig. 14.3 for the case
A = 20. This diagram illustrates how, for large quantum numbers n, the behaviour of
the wave-packet exactly mimics that of an oscillator of mass m. In this representation,
time t = 0 corresponds to the maximum value of x which occurs at cos ω0t = 1, so that
sin ω0t = 0. In this case, the second term in the second square bracket is zero and there
are no ‘beats’ in the proﬁle of the wave-packet. On the other hand, when cos ω0t = 0 and
sin ω0t = 1, the proﬁle is modulated by the function cos Ax = cos 20x. The overall mean
locus of the wave-packet in Fig. 14.3 is half a cosine wave centred on t = 0. In complete
analogy with classical mechanics, Schr¨odinger remarks that the

‘variability of the ‘corrugations’ is to be conceived as depending on velocity, and, as such,
is completely intelligible from all general aspects of undulatory mechanics – but I do not
wish to discuss this further at present.’
14.7 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part3)
Having discovered Courant and Hilbert’s Methods of Mathematical Physics, Schr¨odinger
redoubled his efforts. The next task was to develop perturbation theory, a major goal being
the application of these techniques to account for the Stark broadening of the Balmer lines
of hydrogen. This had been one of the great triumphs of the old quantum theory, thanks to
the work of Epstein (1916a,b) and Schwarzschild (1916).

14.7 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part3)
14.7.1 Courant and Hilbert (1924)
Courant and Hilbert’s remarkable textbook on the Methods of Mathematical Physics pro-
vided a complete summation of all the tools Schr¨odinger needed to ﬁnd solutions of his
wave equation. The titles of the chapters themselves provide an indication of how appro-
priate the mathematical methods were for the solution of wave equations – ‘III Linear
Integral Equations, IV The Calculus of Variations, V Vibration and Eigenvalue Problems,
VI Application of the Calculus of Variations to Eigenvalue Problems, VII Special Func-
tions Deﬁned by Eigenvalue Problems’. For many purposes, Schr¨odinger simply had to
translate the language of Courant and Hilbert into what he now called wave mechanics. As
he remarked in the introduction of this paper, Part 3 of the series,
‘The method is essentially the same as that used by Lord Rayleigh in investigating the
vibrations of a string with small inhomogeneities in his Theory of Sound [(Strutt (Lord
Rayleigh), 1894)]. This was a particularly simple case, as the differential equation of
the unperturbed problem had constant coefﬁcients, and only the perturbing terms were
arbitrary functions along the string. A complete generalisation is possible not merely with
regard to these points, but also for the specially important case of several independent
variables, i.e. for partial differential equations, in which multiple [eigenvalues] appear in
the unperturbed problem, and where the addition of a perturbing term causes the splitting
up of such values and is of the greatest interest in well-known spectroscopic questions
(Zeeman effect, Stark effect, Multiplicities).’
The key mathematical tools were the use of Hermitian operators and the techniques
developed by Sturm and Liouville to treat perturbation solutions of particular types of
second-order differential equations. The concepts of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues were
already well known, as indicated by the reference to Rayleigh’s analyses in the context
of sound waves, but now they had to be applied to Schr¨odinger’s wave equation. The key
mathematical features of the eigenfunctions involved in quantum mechanics are described
in textbooks on quantum mechanics and are as follows:
1. If L is a differential operator, the eigenvalue equation is
Lu(x) = λ u(x) .
(14.80)
The region  over which the problem is to be solved has to be prescribed and appropriate
boundary conditions adopted. The key feature of the solutions needed for quantum
mechanics is that L should be Hermitian, meaning that


u∗(x) Lv(x) d3x =


v∗(x) Lu(x) d3x
∗
,
(14.81)
where the asterisk means the complex conjugate and u and v are arbitrary functions
which satisfy the boundary conditions. The Hermitian behaviour of the wavefunctions
is exactly equivalent to the properties of Hermitian matrices, discussed in Sect. 12.3. In
the case of matrices, the process of determining the eigenvalues is part of the operation
of converting the matrices into diagonal form.

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
2. If L is a Hermitian operator, the eigenvalues are real, just as in the case of Hermitian
matrices.
3. The eigenfunctions of a Hermitian differential operator, associated with different eigen-
values, are orthogonal, meaning that
uv =


u∗(x) v(x) d3x = 0 ,
if u ̸= v .
(14.82)
4. Under very general conditions, the set of eigenfunction solutions forms a complete
orthogonal, normalised set, or orthonormal set, so that, just as in the case of Fourier
series, any well behaved function of x can be synthesised by an inﬁnite series of these
eigenfunctions. Thus,
f (x) =

n
cnun(x) .
(14.83)
Since the un are orthonormal, the coefﬁcients cn can be readily found,

A differential operator of special importance is that associated with the Sturm–Liouville
equation. The operator is



(14.85)
where y ≡y(x) is the dependent function, p ≡p(x), dp/dx and q ≡q(x) are continuous
functions of x and p ≥0. If L(y) = 0, this becomes a linear, homogeneous, second-order
differential equation and it can be readily shown to be Hermitian. Generalising for some
arbitrary weighting function ρ(x) which is a continuous function of x and which never
becomes negative or zero, the set of eigenfunctions found by setting L(y) = Eρ(x)y(x)
and satisfying the boundary conditions is complete and orthonormal. The solutions of the
homogeneous equation result in the eigenfunctions uk and eigenvalues Ek for the stationary
states in, for example, the hydrogen atom. Note that, with the inclusion of the weighting
function, the normalisation condition for the eigenfunctions is

ρ(x) ui(x) uk(x) dx = δi j =

1
if i = j
0
if i ̸= j.
(14.86)
The next step is to ﬁnd the solutions when the system is subject to a small perturbation. We
begin by assuming that the unperturbed solution for the eigenfunctions uk and eigenvalues
Ek are known and then ask how these change when a small perturbing term −λr(x)y is
added to the wave equation so that it become
L[y] −λr(x)y + Eρ(x)y(x) = 0 .
(14.87)
λ is assumed to be a small quantity and r(x) is an arbitrary continuous function of x. It is
therefore expected that the solutions will only result in small changes of the coefﬁcients q
in (14.85). The continuity aspect of the solutions was a key feature for Schr¨odinger. In the
introduction to the paper, he writes

14.7 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part3)
‘[The perturbation method] is based upon the important property of continuity possessed
by [eigenvalues] and [eigenfunctions], principally, for our purpose, upon their continuous
dependence on the coefﬁcients of the differential equation, and less upon the extent of the
domain since in our case the domain . . . and . . . the boundary conditions . . . are generally
the same for the unperturbed and perturbed problems.’
Again, Courant and Hilbert provide the complete solution. For small values of λ, the
energies and eigenfunctions of the perturbed eigenstates are slightly different from their
unperturbed values and so Schr¨odinger writes,
E∗
k = Ek + λϵk ;
u∗
k = uk(x) + λvk(x) .
(14.88)
Substituting these relations into (14.87) and recalling that the unperturbed eigenfunction
for uk satisﬁes the unperturbed wave equation, we ﬁnd
L[vk] = Ekρvk = (r −ϵkρ) uk .
(14.89)
This is now an inhomogeneous equation for vk. Courant and Hilbert showed that the eigen-
function equation for vk only has solutions if the right-hand side of (14.89) is orthogonal
to the associated solution of the homogeneous equation. Therefore,

(r −ϵkρ) u2
k dx = 0 ,
ϵk =

(14.90)
If the functions ui have been normalised, then
ϵk =

ru2
k dx .
(14.91)
Thus, the perturbed energy of the eigenstate k has been found, without determining the
perturbed eigenfunction vk. This result is the exact equivalent of that found in classical
mechanics, namely, that the energy perturbation is in the ﬁrst approximation equal to the
perturbing function averaged over the unperturbed motion.
Finally, to ﬁnd the function vk, the inhomogeneous equation is solved in terms of the
complete set of eigenfunctions ui(x),
vk(x) =

where the dash on the summation means that the term i = j should be omitted from the
sum.
Following his careful exposition of the fundamentals of perturbation theory, Schr¨odinger
extends the procedures to several independent variables, resulting in a set of partial, rather
than ordinary, differential equations.
14.7.2 The Stark effect
Schr¨odinger immediately applies the new formalism to the Stark effect, in which the
perturbation is associated with the inﬂuence of a uniform electric ﬁeld F upon the electron
in the atom. Hence, the perturbed Schr¨odinger wave equation becomes

written as F to avoid confusion with the energy E of the stationary states. He now solves
the perturbation problem in two different ways.
He ﬁrst uses the method of Epstein and Schwarzschild in which they transformed to
the parabolic coordinates used in celestial mechanics and solved the wave equation in that
coordinate system (see Sect. 7.2 and the relations (7.2)). The coordinate transformations
adopted by Schr¨odinger are:
x =
0
λ1λ2 cos φ ;
y =
0
λ1λ2 sin φ ;
z = 1
2(λ1 + λ2) .
(14.97)
With this transformation to λ1, λ2, φ coordinates, Schr¨odinger’s wave equation can be
written in self-adjoint, or Hermitian, form and the solution found by separation of variables,
ψ = 1(λ1) 2(λ2) (φ). First of all, the unperturbed solution is found using the associated
Laguerre polynomials, which Schr¨odinger had found in Courant and Hilbert’s book, to
describe the wavefunctions of the stationary states. Then, the solution for the perturbed
wavefunctions under the inﬂuence of a uniform electric ﬁeld is obtained. The perturbed
stationary states have energies
E = −mee4
8ϵ2
0h2n2 −3h2ϵF
2πmee n(k2 −k1) ,
(14.98)
where k1 and k2 are parabolic quantum numbers, corresponding exactly to the quantum
numbers n1 and n2 introduced in the classical Epstein–Schwarzschild result (7.7) in the
old quantum theory. The principal quantum number is n = n1 + n2 + n3 as in Sect. 7.2. In
addition, Schr¨odinger noted that, just as in Heisenberg’s theory, there are stationary states
with zero orbital quantum number and so the pendulum orbits, which had to be excluded
on heuristic grounds in the old quantum theory, do not exist.
But Schr¨odinger did not leave matters there – he wanted to evaluate the intensities of
the lines observed in the Stark effect as well. Here, he made use of his discovery of the
equivalence between wave mechanics and matrix mechanics so that the matrix elements,
which he had shown could be derived from wave mechanics, were identiﬁed with the dipole
moments associated with transitions between stationary states (see Chap. 15).

14.8 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part4)
Finally, he returned to his calculation of the stationary states in the presence of an electric
ﬁeld and recast the whole calculation in terms of (r, θ, φ) coordinates, what he referred to
as the method of Bohr. Following a lengthy calculation, he demonstrated that exactly the
same result as (14.99) was obtained, remarking that
‘On the whole, we must admit that in the present case the method of secular perturbations
[second approach] is considerably more troublesome than the direct application of a
system of separation [ﬁrst approach].’
14.8 Quantisationasaneigenvalueproblem(Part4)
The fourth paper of the series, received by the Annalen der Physik on 21 June 1926,
concerned the development of the time-dependent form of Schr¨odinger’s wave equation.
In the ﬁrst three papers of the series, Schr¨odinger had successfully developed the wave
mechanical formalism for time-independent wave phenomena, but now he needed to extend
the procedures to time-dependent phenomena such as, for example, particle scattering and
transitions between stationary states in which the eigenvalues change from their initial to
their ﬁnal states. He achieved this by returning to the original form of the wave equation
and understanding how it could be modiﬁed when, for example, the potential term is
time-varying.
In time-independent form, the wave equation
∇2ψ −2m (E −V )
E2
∂2ψ
∂t2 = 0
becomes
∇2ψ + 8π2m
h2
(E −V )ψ = 0 , (14.99)
where the time dependence of the wavefunction is assumed to be of the form
ψ ∝real part of

e±2πiEt/h
,
(14.100)
and E = hν = ¯hω. It follows from this relation that
dψ
dt = ±2πiE
h

e±2πiEt/h
= ±2πiE
h
ψ;
d2ψ
dt2 = −4π2E2
h2

e±2πiEt/h
= −4π2E2
h2
ψ .
(14.101)
Schr¨odinger’s aim was to eliminate the energy E of the eigenstate from the wave equation
so that it could become time-variable. He noted that the ﬁrst differential of ψ in (14.101)
determines the quantity Eψ in terms of dψ/dt and so he makes this substitution into
(14.99):
∇2ψ −8π2m
h2
V ψ = ±4πim
h
∂ψ
∂t .
(14.102)
Schr¨odinger recognised that, by making this substitution, he required the wavefunction to
be complex, but he had a prescription for overcoming this problem.
‘We will require the complex wavefunction ψ to satisfy one of these two equations [14.102].
Since the conjugate complex function ψ will then satisfy the other equation, we may take
the real part of ψ as the real wave function (if we require it).’

Schr¨odinger and wave mechanics
The necessity of introducing complex numbers into quantum mechanics to describe the
time dependence of the wavefunction can be understood from elementary arguments starting
from de Broglie’s relation, as described in the endnotes.11
Having established the time-dependent wave equation, Schr¨odinger was in a position
to tackle a wide variety of problems in quantum physics. In the remainder of Part 4, he
concentrates upon the problem of the theory of dispersion, a problem which had been
successfully tackled by Kramers and Heisenberg (1925) (see Sect. 10.3). He takes the
incident radiation to be described as a perturbation to the potential V associated with the
electric ﬁeld of the incident waves. Thus, the potential can be written
V = V0 + A(x) cos(2πνt) ,
(14.103)
where A(x) is the perturbation to the potential due to incident electric ﬁeld F of the light
waves and can be written −F 
i eizi. Then, the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
becomes
∇2ψ −8π2m
h2
(V0 + A cos 2πνt)ψ = ±4πim
h
∂ψ
∂t .
(14.104)
Schr¨odinger proceeds to solve this equation, ﬁrst by ﬁnding the unperturbed solution and
then by treating the time-varying incident ﬁeld as a perturbation of that solution. We will
not go through that analysis but simply note the form of the perturbed wavefunction,
ψ = uk(x) exp

Ek −En + hν
+ exp (2πit/h) (Ek −hν)
Ek −En −hν

.
(14.105)
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the expression is the free vibration of the system.
The second term shows the effect of the perturbation caused by the incident radiation. Note
that this formula excludes the resonant case in which hν = Ek −En. The important point
is that, just as in Kramers and Heisenberg’s analysis, there are two terms corresponding
to the cases of induced absorption and emission of radiation from states with energy hν
displaced from Ek −En.
The aim of the calculation was to determine the electric dipole moment, or polarisation,
of the medium under the inﬂuence of the incident radiation ﬁeld and Schr¨odinger adopted
the
‘heuristic hypothesis [that] the ﬁeld scalar ψ represents the electric density as a function
of space coordinates and the time, if x stands for only three space coordinates, i.e. if we
are dealing with the problem of one electron.’
Then, the integral of ψψ multiplied by the charge of the particle taken over all the coordi-
nates of the system is taken to represent the distribution of electric charge. Integrating over
all particles of the system, the induced electric dipole moment associated with the incident
radiation could be found. Speciﬁcally, if the classical expression for the dipole moment is
My =  ei yi, the resultant electric dipole moment is

where ρ is the weighting function which ensures that the wavefunctions are self-adjoint.
Schr¨odinger found that his expression for the dispersion of the medium was of similar
form to that deduced by Kramers and Heisenberg, but also was an improvement of their
expression. In later sections of the paper, he goes on to consider the resonant and degenerate
cases.
Schr¨odinger appreciated that these revolutionary new procedures opened up the route to
treating a vast range of problems in atomic physics. In his words,
‘By superposing the perturbations due to a constant electric or magnetic ﬁeld and a light
wave, we obtain magnetic and electric double refraction, and the magnetic rotation of
the plane of polarisation. Resonance radiation in a magnetic ﬁeld also comes under this
heading, . . . Further, we can treat the action of an α-particle or electron ﬂying past the
atom in this way, if the encounter is not too close for the perturbation of each of the two
systems to be calculable from the undisturbed motion of the other. All these questions
are mere matters of calculation as soon as the [eigenvalues] and [eigenfunctions] of the
unperturbed systems are known.’
14.9 Reflections
Schr¨odinger’s was a quite astonishing achievement. To quote Jammer (1989):
‘Schr¨odinger’s brilliant paper was undoubtedly one of the most inﬂuential contributions
ever made in the history of science. It deepened our understanding of atomic phenomena,
served as a convenient foundation for the mathematical solution of problems in atomic
physics, solid state physics and, to some extent, also in nuclear physics, and ﬁnally opened
new avenues for thought. In fact, the subsequent development of non-relativistic quantum
theory was to no small extent merely an elaboration and application of Schr¨odinger’s work.’
The impact upon the community of physicists was instant for here was a system of
wave mechanics which was founded upon well tried and tested procedures in analytic
dynamics. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions were the staple diet of the classical theorist
and here they found new applications in physics at the atomic level. The techniques were
immediately adopted by physicists such as Enrico Fermi and many others who found the
matrix mechanics of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan and Dirac’s q-numbers obscure and
difﬁcult to apply to real physical problems. In contrast, they felt at home with Schr¨odinger’s
transparent scheme of wave mechanics.
But, there was still a long way to go. We have intentionally discussed only ﬁve of the six
papers which Schr¨odinger published in 1926. We missed out his paper on the reconciliation
of the Born–Heisenberg–Jordan approach to quantum problems by matrix mechanics with
wave mechanics – this is the subject of the next chapter. Furthermore, spin has not yet been
incorporated into the infrastructure of quantum mechanics. Schr¨odinger fully appreciated
that spin had to be included in his scheme of wave mechanics and this would involve an
extension of the methods he had so successfully deployed so far. A central role would be
played by a deeper understanding of the role of linear operators.

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
The physics community was now faced with two theories of quantum phenomena which
could scarcely have differed more radically from one another and yet both had achieved
remarkable successes in explaining precisely the same physical phenomena – the spectral
lines of the hydrogen atom, the zero point energy of quantum systems, the quantisation
of the harmonic oscillator, the quantum rotator and the Stark effect. Furthermore, both
theories could account for the experimental data, unlike the predictions of the old quantum
theory. Perhaps these quite different approaches are not so surprising when it is appreciated
that matrix and wave mechanics started from the diametrically opposite poles of the wave–
particle duality.
At the heart of the Heisenberg approach1 was the fundamental role played by the
non-commutative behaviour of the quantum variables and the quantisation of both the
momentum and spatial variables. To accommodate these features, a new mathematical
calculus had been invented from the realisation that matrices followed precisely the correct
algebraic rules. The elaboration of this scheme led to the concept of the energy levels of a
quantum system being associated with the diagonalisation of matrices using the eigenvalue
procedure. As Jammer remarks, the theory
‘. . . deﬁed any pictorial representation; it was an algebraic approach which, proceeding
from the observed discreteness of spectral lines, emphasised the element of discontinuity;
in spite of its renunciation of classical description in space and time it was ultimately a
theory whose basic conception was the corpuscle.’
In complete contrast, Schr¨odinger’s approach was ﬁrmly based upon de Broglie’s insight
into the wave properties of particles and the need to describe these by a wave equation.
Again, quoting Jammer,
‘Schr¨odinger’s [approach] . . . was based on the familiar apparatus of differential equa-
tions, akin to the classical mechanics of ﬂuids and suggestive of an easily visualisable
representation: it was an analytical approach which, proceeding from a generalisation of
the laws of motion, stressed the element of continuity, and, as its name indicates, it was a
theory whose basic concept was the wave.’
Neither Heisenberg nor Schr¨odinger were initially particularly impressed by the other’s
approach. Heisenberg wrote to Pauli that
‘The more I ponder about the physical part of Schr¨odinger’s theory, the more disgusting
it seems to me,’
while Schr¨odinger stated that

15.1 Schr¨odinger (1926d)
‘I was discouraged, if not repelled, by what appeared to me a rather difﬁcult method of
transcendental algebra, defying any visualisation.’
Despite these reservations, a number of authors, including Schr¨odinger, sought to under-
stand how the different approaches could be reconciled. There were general similarities, for
example, in the use of eigenvalues in matrix algebra and in the solutions of the Schr¨odinger
wave equation. Schr¨odinger was in the vanguard of this reconciliation when he discovered
what he referred to as ‘a formal mathematical identity’ of wave and matrix mechanics. But
this was only one of a number of insights into the mathematics necessary to accommodate
both theories in a coherent picture – Lanczos, Born, Wiener, Pauli and Eckart all made
key contributions to the reconciliation of the two approaches. These endeavours led to a
deepening of the understanding of the content of the new theories and set the scene for the
development of the modern theory of quantum mechanics. Many of these developments
took place almost simultaneously and independently – they are all part of Born’s ‘tangle
of interconnected alleys’. Let us begin with Schr¨odinger and then introduce the insights of
the other pioneers.
15.1 Schr¨odinger (1926d)
Schr¨odinger interrupted his series of papers Quantisation as an eigenvalue problem be-
tween Parts 2 and 3 to write his paper On the relation between the quantum mechanics of
Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan, and that of Schr¨odinger which was received by the Annalen
der Physik on 18 March 1926 (Schr¨odinger, 1926d). He had been seeking an accommo-
dation between the two theories, but as late as 22 February 1926 he still had failed to ﬁnd
a solution. Then, suddenly, in a matter of a couple of weeks, he found the answer he was
looking for. In addition to demonstrating the equivalence of the theories, Schr¨odinger’s
paper was a stout defence of the wave mechanical approach to quantum physics, claiming
that it contained all the mathematical apparatus needed to account for the results obtained
by matrix mechanics with the additional virtue of being visualisable.
Schr¨odinger went straight to the heart of matrix mechanics, starting with Born’s funda-
mental relation (12.14), from which all else followed
pq −qp =
h
2πi I ,
(15.1)
where p and q are the matrices associated with the momentum and position variables
respectively and I is the unit matrix.
Immediately, Schr¨odinger translates (15.1) into the language of operator calculus. As
we will discover, all the methods of reconciling matrix and wave mechanics involved a
deepening appreciation of the role of operators in quantum mechanics. Their signiﬁcance
lay in the fact that it was already well-known in the mathematical literature that operator
calculus is non-commutative. Thus, if ;A and ;B are operators, the operator <
AB is not, in
general, the same as the operator <
B A, in other words, such operators do not commute. These
and many more of the key properties of operators had been surveyed by Salvatore Pincherle

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
in an important article of 1906 entitled Functional operators and equations published
in the Encyclop¨adie der mathematischen Wissenschaften (Pincherle, 1906). We will ﬁnd
that the importance of operator calculus began to be appreciated by all those who sought
to reconcile the different approaches to quantum mechanics and the essential tools were
already formulated in the section of Pincherle’s review entitled The elements of operator
calculus.
It is worth quoting Schr¨odinger’s words to understand how he approached the reconcili-
ation of the two theories.
‘The starting point in the construction of matrices is given by the simple observation
that Heisenberg’s peculiar calculating laws for functions of the double set of n quanti-
ties q1, q2, . . . , qn ; p1, p2, . . . , pn (position- and canonically conjugate momentum co-
ordinates) agree exactly with the rules, which ordinary analysis makes linear differential
operators obey in the single set of n variables q1, q2, . . . , qn. So, the co-ordination has
to occur in such a manner that each pl in the function is to be replaced by the operator
∂/∂ql. Actually, the operator ∂/∂ql is exchangeable with ∂/∂qm, where m is arbitrary,
but with qm only, if m ̸= n. The operator, obtained by interchange and subtraction when
m = l, namely,
∂
∂ql
ql −ql
∂
∂ql
,
(15.2)
when applied to any arbitrary function of the qs, reproduces the function, that is, the
operator gives identity. This simple fact will be reﬂected in the domain of matrices as
Heisenberg’s interchange rule.’
This is a key point in the argument. If we write an arbitrary function of qi as
ψ(q1, q2 . . . qn) ≡ψ(q), then
 ∂
∂ql
ql −ql
∂
∂ql

ψ(q) =
∂
∂ql
[qlψ(q)] −ql
∂ψ(q)
∂ql
= ψ(q) + ql
∂ψ(q)
∂ql
−ql
∂ψ(q)
∂ql
= ψ(q) ,
(15.3)
conﬁrming Schr¨odinger’s statement that the operator is an identity operator.
With these words, Schr¨odinger begins his own development of the rules of operator
calculus. He illustrates the rules by an example in which the function is described by a
power series in the ps and qs, a single term of which might be
F(qk, pk) = f (q1, . . . , qn)pr ps pt g(q1, . . . , qn)pr′ h(q1, . . . , qn) pr′′ ps′′ . . . (15.4)
Then, to convert to the operator formalism, he replaces the ps, for example pr, by the
operator K ∂/∂qr, emphasising that the variables need to be ‘well-arranged’. By this, he
means that, just as in the case of matrix multiplication, the order of the products of operators
must be carefully adhered to – the corresponding differentiations must be carried out in a
strict order. Thus, (15.4) is converted into an operator which Schr¨odinger writes as [F, ·]:
[F, ·] = f (q1, . . . , qn)K 3
∂3
∂qr ∂qs ∂qt
g(q1, . . . , qn) K
∂
∂qr′ h(q1, . . . , qn) K 2

15.1 Schr¨odinger (1926d)
If the operator [F, ·] acts upon the function u(q1, . . . qn), some new function [F, u] is
created. The operators must obey the multiplicative rule that, if G is another well-arranged
operator, applying G to [F, u], a new function [GF, u] is created, meaning that ﬁrst the
operator [F, ·] acts upon u and then [G, ·] operates upon [F, u]. In general, [GF, u] is not
the same as [FG, u].
Next, Schr¨odinger associates with the operator [F, ·] a matrix Fkl through the introduc-
tion of a complete orthonormal set of functions for l ≤k, l ≤∞. Writing x for the set
of variables q1, q2, . . . , qn and

dx for the integration over all q-space, the normalised
orthonormal set of functions is
u1(x)
0
ρ(x), u2(x)
0
ρ(x), u3(x)
0
ρ(x), . . . ad inf. ,
(15.6)
with the normalisation conditions

ρ(x) ui(x) uk(x) dx =

0
for i ̸= k ,
1
for i = k ,
(15.7)
where ρ(x) is the weight function introduced to ensure that the normalised functions are
self-adjoint. Schr¨odinger deﬁnes the elements of the matrix Fkl by the following integral2
Fkl =

ρ(x) uk(x) [F, ul(x)] dx .
(15.8)
In his words,
‘. . . a matrix element is computed by multiplying the function of the orthogonal system
denoted by the row-index (whereby we understand always ui, not ui√ρ) by the “density
function” ρ, and by the result arising from using our operator on the orthogonal function
corresponding to the column-index, and then by integrating the whole over the domain.’
Schr¨odinger identiﬁes ql with the ‘scalar operator’ ql and pl with the differential operator
K∂/∂ql. Thus, matrix elements can be associated with ql and pl as follows:
qik
l
=

ρ(x) ui(x) ql uk(x) dx ,
(15.9)

l = K

(15.10)
Next, this formalism is used to derive Born’s quantum condition (15.1). The rule (15.8)
can be used to derive the ik component of the matrix associated with the operator [F, ·] =

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
because of the fact that (15.2) is an identity operator and because of the orthogonality of the
set of functions ui(x) according to (15.7). This is exactly Born’s quantum relation (15.1) if
we set K = h/2πi. This calculation represents the introduction of the momentum operator
pi ≡
h
2πi
∂
∂qi
,
(15.14)
into quantum physics.
Schr¨odinger shows that every function F(p, q) can be translated into an operator [F, ·]
which in turn can be translated into a matrix Fkl using (15.8). Furthermore, these matrices
obey all the rules of matrix mechanics required by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926).
As expressed by Jammer (1989),
‘Any wave-mechanical equation could therefore consistently be translated into a matrix
equation, the operation of F on the wave function ψ, corresponding to the application of
the matrix (Fi j) on the column vector (ak) whose components are the Fourier coefﬁcients
of ψ.’
Schr¨odinger was again in full ﬂight – next he takes the complete set of orthonormal
functions to be the eigenfunctions of the wave equation, which could be written as an
operator equation
[H, ψ] = Eψ ,
(15.15)
where [H, ·] is the operator associated with the Hamiltonian of the system. In fact, (15.15)
is just his wave equation as can be seen as follows:
H = 1
2m (p2
x + p2
y + p2
z) + U(x, y, z) ≡1
2m (px px + py py + pz pz) + U(x, y, z) .

using
px ≡
(h/2πi) ∂/∂x, py ≡(h/2πi) ∂/∂y, pz ≡(h/2πi) ∂/∂z, and then substituting into (15.16),

(15.17)
exactly Schr¨odinger’s time-independent wave equation (14.37). This calculation is the
‘standard’ method of deriving the Schr¨odinger wave equation using operator techniques.
Next, Schr¨odinger had to establish the rules of differentiation of the operator F with
respect to the position ql and momentum pl coordinates. Just as in the case of Born,
Heisenberg and Jordan’s matrix mechanics, the deﬁnitions need some care. In his operator
notation, Schr¨odinger showed that the appropriate forms are

where l = 1, 2, 3, . . . n and i, k = 1, 2, 3, . . . ad inf. Now, according to (12.50), the time
derivative of the matrix element qik
l
associated with the pair of stationary states i and k is
given by
2πi ν(ik)qik
l
= 2πi (νi −νk) qik
l
,
(15.21)
where the frequencies νi and νk have been associated with the states i and k respectively.
Now identifying [F, ·] with the Hamiltonian operator [H, ·] and using (15.19) and the ﬁrst
equation of (15.20), we ﬁnd
(νi −νk)qik
l
= 1
h (Hql −ql H)ik .
(15.22)
Schr¨odinger now chooses the complete set of eigenfunctions associated with his wave
equation (15.15) as the basis for the determination of the matrix elements and so
Hik = El

ρ(x) uk(x) ul(x) dx =

Ei
for i = k ,
0
for i ̸= k .
(15.23)
This expression is then used to work out the terms (Hql)ik and (ql H)ik. We recall that we
need to sum over all the possible intermediate states m to ﬁnd the value of, say, (Hql)ik.
Note that this procedure can be traced back to Heisenberg’s rule (11.18) that the ‘classical’
Fourier term x(2)(n, α) = 
α′ x(n, α′)x(n, α −α′) should be converted into the matrix
format of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926) as xik = 
m ximxmk. Thus,
(Hql)ik =

m
Himqmk
l
.
(15.24)
But, according to the rules (15.23), the only non-zero member of the inﬁnite series is that
for which i = m, and for this case Hii = Ei. Therefore,
(Hql)ik = Eiqik
l
.
(15.25)
Performing the same analysis for (ql H)ik
(ql H)ik =

m
qim
l
H mk = Ekqik
l
.
(15.26)
It immediately follows from (15.25) and (15.26) that, substituting these values into (15.22),
(νi −νk) = 1
h (Ei −Ek) ,
(15.27)
relating the frequencies of transition to the differences of energies of the stationary states.
Schr¨odinger was triumphant:
‘Hence the solution of the whole system of matrix equations of Heisenberg, Born and
Jordan is reduced to the natural boundary value problem of a linear partial differential
equation. If we have solved the boundary value problem, then by the use of [15.8] we can
calculate by differentiations and quadratures every matrix element we are interested in.’

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
These were considerable achievements and demonstrated the equivalence of matrix and
wave mechanics. Strictly speaking, Schr¨odinger had demonstrated that he could trans-
late wave mechanics into matrix mechanics and obtain all the results derived by Born,
Heisenberg and Jordan. It was not so obvious that the translation would work completely
symmetrically in the opposite direction, namely, did matrix mechanics necessarily imply
wave mechanics, or did it contain additional features beyond those which could be described
by wave mechanics? A number of authors were hot on the trail.
15.2 Lanczos (1926)
In fact, Schr¨odinger was not the ﬁrst to seek a reformulation of the matrix mechanics of Born
and Jordan (1925b) in terms of continuous functions. As soon as their paper of 1925 was
published, Kornel (Cornelius) Lanczos showed that their matrix formulation of quantum
mechanics could be written in terms of the kernels found in integral equations. This did
not necessarily advance the cause of the new quantum mechanics among the community
of physicists since, as remarked by Jammer (1989):
‘. . . the use of integral equations with which physicists were – and still are – much less
familiar than with differential equations, the absence of any speciﬁc example or new result,
and certainly also the fact that the publication almost coincided with that of Schr¨odinger’s
ﬁrst communication, explain the relatively cool reception Lanczos’s paper was given.’
Lanczos had already used integral equations in his studies of general relativity in the weak
ﬁeld limit and had become familiar with the techniques through Hilbert’s pioneering study
of 1912 (Hilbert, 1912) and the relevant chapters of Courant and Hilbert’s Methods of
Mathematical Physics (1924).
A key feature of Heisenberg’s paper of 1925 was that the functions depended upon pairs
of variables, say m and n. Lanczos appreciated that the kernel function K(s, σ) found
in integral equations also depended upon two points s and σ in a coordinate space of
arbitrary dimensions. If the kernel is symmetrical, a system of eigenfunctions φi(s), with
s = 1, 2, 3, . . . can be associated with the solution of the integral equation
φ(s) = λ

K(s, σ) φ(σ) dσ ,
(15.28)
where λ is the corresponding eigenvalue. The system of eigenfunctions is orthonormal,
complete and satisﬁes the condition

φi(s) φk(s) ds =

1
for i = k ,
0
for i ̸= k .
(15.29)
Hence the function f (s, σ) can be expanded in terms of the φi(s) as
f (s, σ) =

i
ai(σ) φi(s) .

15.3 Born and Wiener’s operator formalism
Then, the ai(σ) can be expanded in terms of the same inﬁnite sequence of eigenfunctions
φk(σ) and so
f (s, σ) =

i,k
aik φi(s) φk(σ) .
(15.31)
Lanczos identiﬁed the matrix a ≡[aik] with the matrices of Born and Jordan’s matrix
mechanics. He further demonstrated how the complete system of matrix mechanics in Born
and Jordan’s paper could be expressed in terms of the kernels of linear integral equations.
He concluded,
‘Because of the mutual unique relation existing between the matrices and the kernel
functions used in our representation, it does not matter at all for the formal treatment of
the [quantum mechanical] problem, whether one writes down the fundamental equations in
the form of integral equations – as we have done here – or whether one starts immediately
from the constituent coefﬁcients and applies the matrix equation.’
The similarities with Schr¨odinger’s paper are apparent and he acknowledged Lanczos’s
contributions in a footnote to his paper. There is no question, however, about the greater
impact of Schr¨odinger’s paper which was couched in much more accessible mathematical
terms and was also part of a sequence of ground-breaking insights into the nature of the
new quantum mechanics.
15.3 Born and Wiener’s operator formalism
In Sect. 12.3, we left Max Born on his way to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
having completed the ‘Three-Man Paper’ with Heisenberg and Jordan. Born had met
Norbert Wiener in 1924 when the latter was a visitor to G¨ottingen. An exchange programme
was set up by Courant and Wiener, one of the ﬁrst fruits of this collaboration being Born’s
appointment as a ‘foreign lecturer’ at MIT for the fall term of 1925–1926. Born’s lectures
were centred upon the new matrix mechanics, but he was well aware of the shortcomings
of what he, Heisenberg and Jordan had achieved. They had found it impossible to deal
with aperiodic motions, including linear motion in a straight line, and, as described in
Sect. 12.4, there was no simple equivalence for the action–angle variables which were the
natural language of the old quantum theory. Furthermore, there were real mathematical
problems with Born’s assumptions about the properties of unbounded matrices. Despite
these concerns, the theory agreed well with the experimental results and eliminated the
intractable problems of the old quantum theory. Born fully realised that an extension of
matrix mechanics was needed and Wiener turned out to be exactly the person to do this.
Wiener was a mathematical prodigy who was to make many fundamental contributions
to stochastic processes, in particular to the mathematical elaboration of fundamental topics
in electronic engineering, electronic communication and control systems. Just before Born
arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Wiener had written a comprehensive account of the
operational calculus, in particular, a rigorous study of the concept of operators, including

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
Volterra’s integral transformations and Pincherle’s transformations of one power series to
another (Wiener, 1926). In his autobiography, Wiener wrote:
‘When Professor Born came to the United States he was enormously excited about the
new basis Heisenberg had just given for the quantum theory of the atom. Born wanted a
theory which would generalise these matrices . . . . The job was a highly technical one, and
he counted on me for aid. . . . I had the generalisation of matrices already at hand in the
form of what is known as operators. Born had a good many qualms about the soundness
of my method and kept wondering if Hilbert would approve of my mathematics. Hilbert
did, in fact, approve of it, and operators have since remained an essential part of quantum
theory.’ (Wiener, 1956)
As Jammer (1989) notes, the mathematical problems associated with the formulation of
the new quantum mechanics fostered a spirit of collaboration between the pure mathemati-
cians and the physicists, among the ﬁrst fruits of this collaboration being the joint paper by
Born and Wiener which was received by the Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik on 5 January 1926 (Born
and Wiener, 1926). Jammer provides a clear description of the route Born and Wiener
followed in formally introducing operators into quantum mechanics – we will follow his
presentation here. The main topic of Wiener’s paper of 1926 had been a generalisation
of the Fourier integral which made it possible to apply integral operators to both analytic
and non-analytic functions and this found immediate application in Born and Wiener’s
extension of matrix mechanics.
Consider the Fourier series for the two functions y(t) and x(t) of time t:
y(t) =

m
ym exp (2πiWmt/h) ,
(15.32)
x(t) =

n
xn exp (2πiWnt/h) .
(15.33)
The aim of the calculation is to develop an operator expression relating y(t) and x(t),
written symbolically y(t) = qx(t), where q will turn out to be an integral operator. The xn
are found by multiplying (15.33) by exp (−2πiWkt/h) and integrating over all t from −∞
to +∞. Then, the only non-zero term is that for which k = n, so that
xn = lim

(15.34)
Now, let us adopt the matrix transformation

15.3 Born and Wiener’s operator formalism
If we now write
q(t, s) =

m,n
qmn exp [2πi (Wmt −Wns) /h] ,
(15.38)
we can write
y(t) = lim
T =∞
1
2T
 +T
−T
q(t, s) x(s) ds .
(15.39)
Thus, x(s) is converted into y(t) by the integral operator
q = lim
T=∞
1
2T
 +T
−T
ds q(t, s) . . . ,
(15.40)
where it is understood that the function x(s) is to be taken inside the integral. They then
introduced the deﬁnition of a linear operator:
‘An operator is a rule in accordance with which we may obtain from a function x(t)
another function y(t) . . . . It is linear if
q[x(t) + y(t)] = qx(t) + qy(t) .’
(15.41)
Having established the procedure for obtaining the relation y(t) = qx(t), Born and Wiener
next consider the operator Dq ≡∂q/∂t. From (15.39), we ﬁnd
y(t) = Dq x(t) = lim
T =∞

 +T
−T
∂q(t, s)

(15.42)
Now, using the relation (15.38) for q(t, s), differentiation gives
∂q(t, s)
∂t
= 2πi
h

m,n
qmnWm exp [2πi (Wmt −Wns) /h] .
(15.43)
Just as (15.38) deﬁnes the relation between the operator q and the matrix qmn, so (15.43)
provides the relation between the operator Dq and the matrix element (Dq)mn, namely
(Dq)mn =
2πi
h Wmqmn

.
(15.44)
Next, consider the operator q D = q∂/∂t. Then,
y = q ∂x(t)

T=∞

q(t, s)∂x(s)

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
Hence, the matrix element mn associated with the operator (Dq −q D) has elements
(Dq −q D)mn = 2πiqmn
h
(Wm −Wn) .
(15.49)
Since hνmn = Wm −Wn, it follows that
(Dq −q D)mn = 2πiνmnqmn .
(15.50)
Born and Wiener recognised that the right-hand side of (15.50) corresponded to the
derivative of the mn component of the matrix with respect to time, as demonstrated by
(12.49) and (12.50), and so they identiﬁed the right-hand side with ˙qmn. The corresponding
operator equation becomes
Dq −q D = ˙q .
(15.51)
This operator equation can be compared with the corresponding matrix equation (12.53).
Given the clear correspondence between the matrix and operator formalisms, Born and
Wiener went on to identify the operator form of the commutation relation as
pq −qp =
h
2πi1 ,
(15.52)
where 1 is the unit operator, and the canonical equations
˙q = ∂H(pq)
∂p
, ˙p = −∂H(pq)
∂q
,
(15.53)
as operator equations in which the operators p and q are Hermitian. This provided a
complete equivalence between the operator and matrix mechanics formalisms.
With this new formalism, they identiﬁed the energy operator with (h/2πi)D. In addition,
they solved the problems of the quantised harmonic oscillator and linear motion, thus
demonstrating the ability of the scheme to deal with both periodic and aperiodic motion.
What is intriguing is that they did not make the simple identiﬁcation of the momentum
operator p through the relation p = (h/2πi) ∂/∂q, which would have led directly to wave
mechanics and Schr¨odinger’s wave equation. As Born lamented,3
‘We expressed the energy as d/dt and wrote the commutation law for energy and time as
an identity by applying [t(d/dt) −(d/dt)t] to a function of t; it was absolutely the same
for q and p. But we did not see that. And I never will forgive myself, for had we done
this, we would have had the whole wave mechanics from quantum mechanics at once, a
few months before Schr¨odinger.’
15.4 Pauli’s letter to Jordan
Born sent a copy of his paper with Wiener to Heisenberg in January 1926. Heisenberg
then forwarded a copy to Pauli as well as a copy of the paper by Lanczos. Pauli was
characteristically scathing about the formal mathematics developed by these authors and

15.4 Pauli’s letter to Jordan
developed his own version of operator methods, which we will not enter into here. More
signiﬁcantly, in early February, Sommerfeld had asked him to look out for the publication
of Schr¨odinger’s paper on wave mechanics which Sommerfeld described as involving a
‘totally crazy method’, but which reproduced many of the results of matrix mechanics.
Pauli worked on Schr¨odinger’s paper over the Easter holidays while he was visiting
Copenhagen. By early April, he had achieved what he later described as the ‘complete clar-
iﬁcation of the connection of Schr¨odinger’s theory and quantum mechanics’. The argument
was set out in a letter of 12 April 1926 to Pascual Jordan.4 Pauli was strongly impressed by
the fact that Schr¨odinger had been able to recover precisely his results for the hydrogen atom
and also by the fact that the two theories seemed to be based upon quite different hypotheses
and mathematical techniques. The ﬁrst part of the letter to Jordan simply reformulates de
Broglie’s insights and the derivation of Schr¨odinger’s wave equation. The second half of
the letter concerns Pauli’s reconciliation of the two theories.
For simplicity, Pauli considers only the one-dimensional case of the Schr¨odinger wave
equation which he writes
d2ψ
dx2 + 8π2m0
h2

E −Epot(x)

ψ = 0 .
(15.54)
As Schr¨odinger had shown, for E < Epot, the equation only has solutions for speciﬁc energy
eigenvalues E1, E2, E3, . . . with corresponding eigenfunctions ψ1, ψ2, . . . and these form
a complete orthonormal set with
 ∞
−∞
ψn ψm dx =

0
for n ̸= m ,
1
for n = m .
(15.55)
It is simplest to quote the central insights of the letter in Pauli’s own words:
‘Now one considers in particular the expansion of xψn:
xψn(x) =

m
xnmψm(x)
with
xnm =
 +∞
−∞
x ψn ψm dx .
(15.56)
One also puts
(px)nm = ih
2π
 +∞
−∞
∂ψn
∂x ψm dxi
with
ih
2π
∂ψn
∂x =

m
(px)nm ψm(x) .
(15.57)
. . . Now, if xnm = xmn is real, (px)nm = −(px)mn is purely imaginary. It can be shown
without difﬁculty, that the matrices for x and px thus deﬁned satisfy the equations of the
G¨ottingen mechanics. Namely,
pxx −xpx =
h
2πiI
and
H =
1
2m0
p2
x + Epot(x) ,
(15.58)
with H representing the diagonal Hamiltonian matrix whose elements En provide the
energy eigenvalues. From the rule of multiplication it follows that the matrix belonging
to any function F(x) of x is just given by the coefﬁcients
Fnm =
 +∞
−∞
F(x) ψn ψm dx .
(15.59)
I shall not write out the calculation in detail; you will be able to verify the assertion easily.’

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
Pauli fully appreciated the great power of Schr¨odinger’s approach which could be ex-
tended straightforwardly to incorporate perturbation theory and so to the solution of nu-
merous problems including the intensities of the spectral lines in the Zeeman effect. Two
further quotations from this letter are particularly noteworthy:
‘In principle, in the G¨ottingen theory as well as in de Broglie’s statement of the quantum
problem, no description of the electron in the atom in space and time is given.’
‘It seems that one also sees now, how from the point of view of quantum mechanics the
contradistinction between ‘point’ and ‘set of waves’ fades away in favour of something
more general.’
By 18 April 1926, Schr¨odinger had learned about Pauli’s achievements and wrote to
Sommerfeld the same day:
‘With Pauli I have exchanged a couple of letters. He really is a phenomenal person. How
he has discovered everything again? In a tenth of the time which I needed for it!’
15.5 Eckart and the operator calculus
In 1925, the 23-year old Carl Eckart won a fellowship to work at the California Institute
of Technology. He had the good fortune to attend the lectures which Born presented on his
latest research with Wiener into operator methods in quantum mechanics. These proved
to be the inspiration for his synthesis of the wave and matrix mechanical approaches to
quantum theory. Following Born’s lectures, he made a thorough study of the operator
formalism and, in his words,
‘The result was that I . . . was completely familiar with what is now known as the
Schr¨odinger operator (the energy operator) before Schr¨odinger’s papers appeared in
Pasadena.’
Then the papers of Lanczos and Schr¨odinger were published in March 1926. Eckart re-
alised that these were fully consistent with the Born–Wiener operator approach. What he
appreciated was the following:
‘The Lanczos quantum theory requires a set of orthogonal functions, by means of which
the matrices of Born and Jordan are to be determined . . . Schr¨odinger had published a
quantum principle which leads directly to a set of orthogonal functions . . . If these are
interpreted as the functions entering into the Lanczos theory, the matrices of the Born-
Jordan theory are readily obtained.’ (Eckart, 1926b)
Eckart published his paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences to
establish the precedence of his ideas and these were elaborated in much more detail in his
paper published in the Physical Review later the same year (Eckart, 1926a).
The motivation for these studies was the fact that, although the new Born–Wiener scheme
of operator dynamics provided a more rigorous foundation for quantum mechanics, it was
still difﬁcult to ﬁnd solutions for more than a few of the simpler problems of atomic

15.5 Eckart and the operator calculus
physics. Eckart’s objective was to sythesise the approaches of Born and Wiener, Dirac and
Schr¨odinger into a single operator calculus in which all the quantities appearing in the
equations are operators. Again, all the necessary tools were already available in Pincherle’s
review (Pincherle, 1906), but now they had to be reformulated for applications in atomic
physics.
In the ﬁrst part of his paper in the Physical Review, Eckart rewrote the equations of
classical mechanics entirely in the language of operators. Thus, Hamilton’s equations now
became
dPj
dT = −∂H(P, Q)
∂Q j
;
dQ j
dT
= ∂H(P, Q)
∂Pj
,
(15.60)
where the quantities, P, Q, T and H are all operators. In his ﬁrst paper, Eckart noted that,
‘In translating ordinary equations into operator notation, nothing new is introduced. The
transition involves merely a change of mental focus. Instead of concentrating the attention
on the numerical quantities, it is directed to the operations of combining them.’
The words are similar to those already quoted by Dirac:
‘. . . the classical equations are to be retained formally without alteration . . . only the
operations by which the quantities involved are combined are to be altered.’
Let us outline what Eckart did. His operator calculus made use of the results already
obtained by Dirac and by Born and Wiener. To do this, he adopted general linear opera-
tors which obeyed Born’s condition (15.41) and deﬁned an operator Dx by the following
equation,
Dx X −X Dx = [1⊗] ,
(15.61)
where the right-hand side denotes the unit operator. This expression ensures that the op-
erators are non-commutative. Then, following the rules of matrix calculus of Born and
Jordan and the q-number calculus of Dirac, the following algebraic rules for operators were
established:
dQ
dX = Dx Q −QDx ,
(15.62)
d
dX (Q + P) = dQ
dX + dP
dX ,
(15.63)
d
dX (QP) = dQ
dX P + Q dP
dX .
(15.64)
The deﬁnition (15.61) and the rule of differentiation (15.62) could be generalised to a
number of independent operator variables Q1, Q2, . . . , Qn so that
D j Qi −Qi D j = [δi j⊗] ,
(15.65)
dF
dQi
= D j F −FD j .

to be compared with experiment. Eckart used the result which could be derived from Born
and Wiener’s paper, namely,
1
ψ Pjψ = pi ,
1
ψ Q jψ = qi ,
(15.69)
or, more generally,
1
ψ Fψ = f ,
(15.70)
where F is any function of Pj and Q j. For stationary states, Born and Wiener had used the
result that the time dependence of the eigenfunctions takes the form Wn ∝exp(2πiWnt/h)
and so, using (15.70) for the Hamiltonian operator H(Pj Q j), it follows that
1
ψn
H(Pj Q j)ψn = Wn .
(15.71)
Eckert noted immediately that
‘[15.71] will be seen [to be] the equation published by Schr¨odinger in another
form . . . which, in addition to deﬁning ψn, serves to distinguish a certain discrete se-
quence of values of W from all others.’
To complete the argument, Eckart had to deﬁne the operators associated with Qi and Pi
and he chose the position operator Q j to mean multiplication by the scalar quantity q j and
Pj to be the canonically conjugate momentum operator
Pj =
h
2πi
∂
∂qi
.
(15.72)
Inserting these deﬁnitions into (15.71), Schr¨odinger’s wave equation follows directly and
hence the solution of the energies of the stationary states of the hydrogen atom. To complete
the picture, Eckart showed how to ﬁnd the matrix elements Q j(nk) associated with the
general operator F,
Q j f =

Fn Q j(nk)ψk .

15.6 The WKB approximation
He concluded his paper with the remark that:
‘The method of obtaining the matrices which has just been outlined differs very little
from Lanczos’s interpretation of the matrix calculus which is thus included in the present
calculus.’
This work, submitted to the Physical Review on 7 June 1926, but only published in October
1926, completed the formal identity of matrix and wave mechanics and demonstrated the
power of operator techniques in quantum mechanics.
15.6 Reconciling quantum mechanics and Bohr’s quantisation
of angular momentum – the WKB approximation
An issue which perplexed Bohr and his colleagues was: why was the simple Bohr model of
the atom so successful when it now appeared that the quantisation of orbits was associated
with boundary conditions which had to be imposed upon permissible solutions of the
Schr¨odinger wave equation at inﬁnity? The answer was soon provided by the independent
analyses of Gregor Wentzel (1926a), Kramers (1926) and L´eon Brillouin (1926), who used
what is now known as the WKB approximation.5
Except for a few special cases, analytic solutions of Schr¨odinger’s equation are not
available, but the WKB approximation enables approximate solutions to be found in cases
in which the potential varies slowly with position x. By ‘slow’, we mean that the changes
in potential are small on the scale of the de Broglie wavelength. These were the cases
discussed independently by Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin. In the case in which there
is no spatial variation of the potential function, the result corresponding to the solution
in classical mechanics is found. In the case in which the potential is slowly varying,
the solution to ﬁrst order in the small quantity h/2πi results in Sommerfeld’s quantum
relation
#
p dx = nh .
(15.74)
In the later analyses by Kramers and his colleagues (Niessen, 1928; Kramers and Ittmann,
1929), it was shown that the relation is in fact
#
p dx =

n + 1
2

h .
(15.75)
Enrico Persico (1938) gives a simple derivation of the result (15.75) starting from
Schr¨odinger’s equation, making exactly the same approximations as in the papers by Wentzel
(1926a), Kramers (1926) and Brillioun (1926). First, Persico writes the one-dimensional
Schr¨odinger wave equation for an oscillator in the usual form

(E −U)ψ = 0 .

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
Fig. 15.1
Fig. 1 (top) illustrates the potential function of a harmonic oscillator with various values ofU and Edescribed in the
text. Fig. 2 (bottom) shows a solution of the Schr¨odinger wave equation for a harmonic oscillator for principal
quantum number n = 8. Both diagrams are from Persico (1938).
The potential U and the solution of Schr¨odinger’s wave equation as a function of x are
illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 of Fig. 15.1 which are taken from Persico’s paper. It can be seen
that the oscillations of the wavefunction are much more rapidly varying than the change
in the potential U. To a good approximation, in the region AB away from the immediate
vicinity of the points A and B at which E = U, the angular frequency of oscillation is

A better approximation would be to seek a solution of the form
ψ(x) = F(x) sin[S(x)] ,
(15.80)
where F(x) is a slowly varying function of x. Inserting this trial solution into (15.78), we

F′′ −FS′2 + ω2F = 0 ;
2F′S′ + FS′′ = 0 .
(15.82)
If F is a slowly varying function of x, |F′′| ≪ω2|F|, and so the ﬁrst expression in (15.82)
becomes
ω2 = S′2.
(15.83)
The solution for S is then
S =

(15.84)
where θ is a constant.
The second expression in (15.82) can be integrated immediately to give
F =

(15.86)
Now, it is clear that the solution (15.86) is not valid at the points A and B, at which
E −U = 0. Dealing with A ﬁrst, Persico introduces the trick of replacing the parabolic
function U with a ‘step’, indicated by the dashed lines in the vicinity of A in Fig. 1 of
Fig. 15.1. In the interval A to A′′, the potential takes the constant value U1 and in the
interval A to A′, the constant value U2. The potentials U1 and U2 are chosen such that
U2 −E = E −U1 .
(15.87)
Therefore, in the interval A to A′′, the frequency of oscillation takes the constant value
ω1 =
+
8π2m

(E −U1) .
(15.88)
Inserting this value into (15.86), the wavefunction measured from A is
ψ =

sin [ω1(x −x1) + θ] .
(15.89)
Now consider the wavefunction in the interval A′ to A. In this region, U2 > E and so the

Reconciling matrix and wave mechanics
Now we need to join together the solutions (15.89) and (15.91) at A. As usual, for any

This is the WKB solution found by Kramers and his colleagues. Notice the important point
that the ﬁrst maximum of the wavefunction occurs at phase π/4 from x1 in the positive
x-direction.
Similar considerations apply to the wavefunction in the vicinity of B, the point x2 lying
π/4 beyond the last maximum. Therefore, the total phase difference between A and B, or
x1 and x2, is

related to the angular frequency of the wavefunction through (15.77), p = hω/2π. If we
now take the integral of p dx through one complete oscillation of the harmonic oscillator,

precisely with Bohr–Sommerfeld quantisation condition, including the term 1

We recall that there is no mention of the motion of the electron in the atom according
to either wave or matrix mechanics, a point emphasised in the quotation by Pauli at the
end of Sect. 15.4: ‘no description of the electron in the atom in space and time is given’.
It seems best to regard Bohr’s quantisation of angular momentum as a lucky coincidence
which opened up the route to the old and new quantum physics.
15.7 Reflections
By mid-1926, it was becoming clear that the operator calculus was the way ahead for
the study of quantum problems, stimulated by the remarkable insights of Born, Dirac,

achievement. In his obituary of Schr¨odinger, he referred to his papers of 1926 as ‘of a
grandeur unsurpassed in theoretical physics’ (Born, 1961b). Planck was equally effusive:
‘[Schr¨odinger’s wave equation] plays the same part in modern physics as do the equations
established by Newton, Lagrange and Hamilton in classical mechanics.’ (Planck, 1931b)
The next few years saw an extraordinary ﬂowering of quantum mechanics as more and
more ﬂesh was put on the skeleton of the operator calculus.

Spin and quantum statistics
The discovery of the spin of the electron by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit was a major ad-
vance in the understanding of physics at the atomic level. Its discovery coincided with the
development of both matrix and wave mechanics and its incorporation into the scheme of
quantum mechanics and statistics led to deeper understanding of the underlying structure
of quantum mechanics. Almost immediately, Heisenberg and Jordan used the new scheme
of matrix mechanics to derive the expression for the g-factor which Land´e had derived
empirically from a very close study of the anomalous Zeeman effect. An important con-
sequence of these developments was that the different approaches of matrix and wave
mechanics were brought together. In particular, the discovery of spin as a new quantum
number suggested the possibility of understanding systems containing more than one elec-
tron. Heisenberg’s analysis of the helium atom was to pave the way for the full incorporation
of spin into quantum mechanics and quantum statistics.
16.1 Spin and the Land´e g-factor
The story of the discovery of the spin of the electron by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit (1925a)
was told in Sect. 8.5. As discussed in that section, their discovery was based upon empirical
studies of the regularities observed in the anomalous Zeeman effect, inspired by the intricate
analyses of Land´e. Although based originally upon the classical concept of a rotating
electron, electron spin is a purely quantum mechanical property intrinsic to the electron.
Opinions were strongly divided about the validity of the concept, Pauli taking a strongly
negative position, while Bohr, Heisenberg and Jordan took a more positive view. The
challenge taken up by Heisenberg was to ﬁnd a quantum mechanical solution for the
anomalous Zeeman effect using the concept of a spin- 1
2 particle within the context of their
recently completed matrix formalism.
Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit’s innovations were to postulate that the electron has an intrinsic
spin with spin quantum numbers s = ± 1
2 and that the gyromagnetic ratio associated with
electron spin should be twice that associated with the electron’s orbital motion. We recall
that the gyromagnetic ratio for orbital motion of the electron μe(orb) is the ratio of the
magnetic moment associated with that motion to its angular momentum. For electron spin,
the gyromagnetic ration μe(spin) was postulated to be twice that value. Thus,
μe(orb) =
e
2me
L ;
μe(spin) = e
me
s ,

16.1 Spin and the Land´e g-factor
where L and s are the angular momentum vectors associated with the orbital motion and
electron spin respectively. Then, the Hamiltonian H for an electron in a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B can be written
H = H0 + H1 + H2 + H3 .
(16.2)
Heisenberg took the various contributions to H to be as follows:
r The term H0 is the energy associated with the non-relativistic motion of a spinless electron
about the nucleus in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld.
r The second term H1 represents the interaction energy between the orbital angular mo-
mentum L and spin s of the electron with the external magnetic ﬁeld B,
H1 =
e
2me
B · (L + 2s) .
(16.3)
r The term H2 represents the energy associated with the coupling between the induced
magnetic ﬁeld Bi observed in the frame of reference of the moving electron and the
magnetic moment of the electron, what is termed spin–orbit coupling. For a single
electron orbiting a nucleus of charge Ze, the electric ﬁeld strength at radius r from
the nucleus is
E =
Ze
4πϵ0r3 r
(16.4)
and so the induced, or internal, magnetic ﬂux density observed by the electron in its rest
frame is

(L · s) ,
(16.6)
where the overline means the value of r−3 averaged over the orbit of the electron. Note
that more generally, when the effects of shielding by other electrons in the atom are taken
into account, the electric ﬁeld will not be of inverse-square form but can be written
E = −dV (r)
dr
,
(16.7)
where V (r) is the mean radial electrostatic potential. Associated with the interaction
energy there is a precession of the axis of the magnetic moment of the electron about the
internal magnetic ﬁeld, just as in the case of the classical analysis of the Zeeman effect

is proportional to the interaction energy, LS ∝H2.

Spin and quantum statistics
r The ﬁnal term H3 represents the relativistic corrections to the Hamiltonian which was
taken from Sommerfeld’s analysis of the classical relativistic hydrogen atom (Sommer-
feld, 1916a).
Despite the less than encouraging views of Pauli, in November 1925 Heisenberg set
about putting the above Hamiltonian through what he referred to as the ‘matrix mill’ in
order to ﬁnd the stationary states and line splittings associated with the anomalous Zeeman
effect. Disappointingly, he almost reproduced Land´e’s formula for the anomalous Zeeman
effect, but the crucial spin–orbit coupling term resulted in a factor of 2 discrepancy from
Land´e’s expression, a result which cast doubt on the whole scheme.
In early January 1926, Heisenberg became aware of the new operator formulation of
quantum mechanics of Born and Wiener (1926) which opened up the route for extending
matrix mechanics to the more general operator formalism. He was then able to re-evaluate
the problem using action–angle variables, but nonetheless, the stubborn factor of 2 remained,
causing general disappointment among the proponents of electron spin.
The solution was, however, at hand thanks to the insight of Llewellyn Thomas who had
arrived recently at Bohr’s Institute in Copenhagen as a visiting graduate student. Thomas re-
examined the relativistic transformations between the frame of the electron and the external
frame and discovered that the expression (16.6) was not the complete story. Thomas was
aware of the fact that there is an addition kinematic effect associated with the orbital
motion of a vector, such as the spin vector of the electron, according to the special theory
of relativity. Thomas was aware of such a precession which had been worked out by de
Sitter in the context of the relativistic precession of the Moon and which is analysed in
Eddington’s book The Mathematical Theory of Relativity (Eddington, 1924). As Thomas
expressed it in his short paper to Nature (Thomas, 1926),
‘[According to the above argument], the precession of the spin axis . . . is its precession in a
system of coordinates (2) in which the centre of the electron is momentarily at rest. System
(2) is obtained from system (1), in which the electron is moving and the nucleus at rest,
by a Lorentz transformation with the velocity v. If the acceleration of the electron is [a],
and the system (3) is obtained from system (1) by a Lorentz transformation with velocity
v + a dt, then the precession which an observer at rest with respect to the nucleus would
observe, and which should be summed to give the secular precession, is that precession
which would turn the direction of the spin axis at time t in (2) into its direction at time
t + dt in (3) if both directions were regarded as directions in (1). To a ﬁrst approximation
system (3) is obtained from system (2) by a Lorentz transformation with the velocity a dt
together with a rotation (1/2c2)[v × a] dt.’
This purely kinematic effect results in an additional contribution to the precession, and
hence interaction energy, of the electron which amounts to
T = −1
2c2 [v × a] ,

and since, to a ﬁrst approximation, mea = eE, it follows that

16.2 Heisenberg and the helium atom
Thus, the effective internal ﬁeld is only half the value given by (16.6) and can account com-
pletely for the discrepant factor of 2. After considerable debate, even Pauli was converted
and the paper on the quantum mechanical explanation for the anomalous Zeeman effect
was published by Heisenberg and Jordan in June 1926 (Heisenberg and Jordan, 1926).
Rechenberg has written in his summary of the history of quanta and quantum mechanics
that the explanation of the anomalous Zeeman effect was one of the greatest triumphs of
matrix mechanics (Rechenberg, 1995).
16.2 Heisenberg and the helium atom
Following the departure of Kramers to take up the chair of theoretical physics at Utrecht,
Heisenberg succeeded to the post of university lecturer and assistant to Bohr in Copenhagen
in May 1926. It was well-known that the old quantum theory had insuperable problems
in dealing with atoms with more than one electron and Heisenberg was well aware of
these, having already worked on the theory of the helium atom on the basis of the Bohr–
Sommerfeld theory of atomic structure. By 1926, however, the problem was ripe for a
renewed attack. The discoveries of electron spin by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit (1925a)
and Pauli’s exclusion principle (1925) as well as the success with which Heisenberg and
Jordan had accounted for the anomalous Zeeman effect using the operator enhancement
of matrix mechanics suggested a new approach to the helium problem. At the same time,
Heisenberg rapidly assimilated Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics which provided a simpler
means of determining the relevant matrix elements.
The well-known problem associated with the spectra of helium and the alkaline-earth
metals, such as magnesium and calcium, was that there are two apparently separate and
independent sets of lines present in their optical spectra. In the case of helium, the corre-
sponding separate term diagrams were referred to as belonging to para and orthohelium
(Fig. 16.1). Both sets of energy levels were not so different from the terms appearing in the
hydrogen term diagram. The parahelium lines were all singlets whereas the orthohelium
series consisted of very narrow triplets – the energy levels of the ortho terms are slightly
more tightly bound than those of the corresponding para terms. Originally, it was thought
that helium was in fact a mixture of two gases, para and orthohelium.
According to Goudsmit’s recollections,1 he and Bohr discussed the problem of the helium
spectrum in February 1926 during a visit to Copenhagen, not long after the discovery of
spin. He recalled that
‘By looking at the helium spectrum Bohr understood right away that if you turned over
one of the two spins [of the electrons in the helium atom], the energy suddenly would be
entirely different.’
Goudsmit attempted to explain the large energy difference between the ground states of
ortho and parahelium in terms of a magnetic interaction between the magnetic moments of
the two electrons, but could not obtain as large a difference as observed.

Spin and quantum statistics
Fig. 16.1
The term diagram for helium (Herzberg, 1944). The term diagram on the left is for parahelium and is characterised by
the two electrons having opposite spins and so S = 0, corresponding to singlet states. The term diagram on the right
is for orthohelium in which the electrons have parallel spins so that S = 1 and the states are triplet states.
Transitions between the singlet and triplet states are forbidden.
Heisenberg realised that the solution to the problem lay in applying Pauli’s exclusion
principle to the helium atom (see Sect. 8.4). On a postcard written to Pauli towards the end
of April 1926, Heisenberg wrote
‘we have found a rather decisive argument that your exclusion of equivalent orbits [of
two electrons in an atom] is connected with the singlet–triplet separation. . . . Consider
the energy written as a function of the transition probabilities. Then, a large difference
results if one . . . has transition to 1S, or if, according to your ban [exclusion principle],
one puts them equal to zero. That is, para- and ortho-[helium] do have different energies,
independently of the interaction between magnets.’
This provided the spur to Heisenberg to begin calculating. According to the Pauli exclusion
principle, two electrons with opposite spins could occupy the ground state and would
correspond to the parahelium series. On the other hand, if the spins were parallel, one of
the electrons could remain in the ground state but the other would have to occupy a less
tightly bound orbit, well above the ground state. Central to the analysis was the fact that
the two electrons in the helium atom are identical particles and this could not be ignored.
In the scheme of matrix mechanics, neglecting the weak interaction between the magnetic
moments of the electrons, Heisenberg adopted a model in which the Hamiltonian matrix H0
was composed of two terms, Ha and Hb, each term referring to the motion of the electron
under the inﬂuence of the combined Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus and the two electrons.

16.2 Heisenberg and the helium atom
The charge experienced by an electron in the unshielded Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus
would be 2e, or e if the nuclear charge were shielded by the other electron. The key point
realised by Heisenberg was that the exchange of the a and b electrons would leave the
energies of the stationary states unaltered.
Heisenberg proceeded with the calculation of the stationary states of the helium atom
treating the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons as a ﬁrst-order perturbation. The
result was the discovery of two separate symmetric and antisymmetric solutions for the
stationary states, transitions being allowed within each set of separate energy levels, but
not between them. Initially, Heisenberg identiﬁed the symmetric solutions as the ones to
be adopted and considered this choice to be consistent with Pauli’s exclusion principle
and with Bose–Einstein statistics. Much later, in an interview in 1963, he confessed to his
confusion about the nature of the statistics to be associated with the electrons in atoms in
1926. He stated:
‘For a long time, I continued to mix up Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac statistics. I did not
know Fermi–Dirac statistics at that time; I knew only the Pauli exclusion principle. I was
always confused between Bose–Einstein statistics and the Pauli exclusion principle which
produce different ways of counting states. When I wrote the equations for two identical
electrons, there were two solutions, one symmetrical and the other anti-symmetrical. First I
thought that I had to take the anti-symmetrical solution to obtain the Bose statistics and that
must be the one that gave the Pauli principle. Later, I saw that it was the other way around.
One must take the symmetrical solution to get Bose statistics, and the antisymmetrical
solution to get Pauli’s exclusion principle.’ (Heisenberg, 1963)
Heisenberg proceeded to carry out the analysis to ﬁnd the energy levels of the helium atom
and, in doing so, made use of Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics to evaluate the perturbation
terms. The Hamiltonian for the helium atom can be written

where r1 and r2 are the distances of the electrons from the nucleus and r12 is the distance
between the electrons. For the unperturbed helium atom, in which the interaction between
the electrons as represented by the last term in (16.11) is omitted, Schr¨odinger’s equation is
separable and wavefunction solutions of the form ψ = φ1

Spin and quantum statistics
With this approximation, Heisenberg was able to ﬁnd a reasonable quantitative explanation
of the energy levels in the para and ortho states of the helium atom. In the second part of
his paper he included the small additional changes associated with electron spin, which
included the correct splitting of the singlet and triplet states. Heisenberg’s papers were pub-
lished in August and October 1926 (Heisenberg, 1926a,b). In the second paper, Heisenberg
acknowledged the value of Schr¨odinger’s approach to the evaluation of the energy levels
and transition probabilities. He wrote
‘I used Schr¨odinger’s formalism for help with the mathematics. It was clear to me that
in order to calculate the shift of the levels in the helium atom, matrix elements were
needed, and that they could be calculated quite well from Schr¨odinger’s scheme. Such a
calculation in matrix mechanics would have been difﬁcult.’
This major advance in understanding the properties of the helium atom were reﬁned by a
number of authors, leading ultimately to an accurate estimate of the ionisation potential of
the helium atom by Kellner (1927). These calculations were also to lead to the development
of the concept of exchange forces, the quantum mechanical force associated with the fact that
two identical electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state. This would ultimately lead to
Heisenberg’s application of the concept of exchange forces to the theory of ferromagnetism
(Heisenberg, 1928), but ﬁrst we need to get to grips with the statistical properties of spin- 1

particles, Fermi–Dirac statistics.
16.3 Fermi–Dirac statistics – the Fermi approach
The young Enrico Fermi visited G¨ottingen and Leiden as a research fellow in 1923–1925 and
became familiar with the issues of quantum physics. In 1925 he was appointed a lecturer in
physics at the University of Florence and then to a new professorship of theoretical physics at
the University of Rome in 1926. His early interest in quantum physics had been in the equa-
tion of state of an ideal gas, in particular, Nernst’s heat theorem according to which the heat
capacities of all substances tend to zero as the temperature tends to zero, contrary to the ex-
pectations of classical statistical mechanics. The papers by Bose and Einstein appeared in
1924 and 1925 (see Sect. 9.2) and Fermi certainly knew about them (Bose, 1924; Einstein,
1924, 1925). They had treated light quanta and the atoms of an ideal gas as indistinguishable
particles and argued that the procedure of allocating these entities to the available states in
phase space should avoid duplications, provided the particles were indistinguishable.
Fermi was even more strongly impressed by Pauli’s recent enunciation of the exclusion
principle for the electrons in the atom (Pauli, 1925), namely, that only one electron can
occupy a particular quantum state with a given set of atomic quantum numbers (Sect. 8.4).
In the standard formulation of statistical mechanics, the available states within an enclosure
are enumerated by counting the available states in momentum space, which is equivalent
to ﬁtting a ﬁnite, but very large, number of wavelengths within its reﬂecting walls – the
result is an essentially continuous distribution of energies and momenta of the particles.
Fermi now proposed reducing the size of the enclosure so that it included only a single atom
and then applying Pauli’s exclusion principle to that volume. But unlike Pauli, who applied

16.3 Fermi–Dirac statistics – the Fermi approach
his rule to the electrons in the atom, Fermi proposed applying the same type of exclusion
principle to the atoms of a perfect gas. Fermi wrote,
‘. . . one obtains a degeneracy [of the gas] of the expected order of magnitude, if one
chooses the vessel to be so small as to contain, on average, only one molecule. . . . We
shall demonstrate . . . that the application of the Pauli rule allows us to present a complete,
consistent theory of the degeneracy of ideal gases.’ (Fermi, 1926b)
Fermi’s ﬁrst publication on his new quantum statistics appeared in Italian in the Rendiconti
del Reale Accademia Lincei on 7 February 1926 and then in German in the Zeitschrift f¨ur
Physik on 11 May 1926 (Fermi, 1926a,b). Fermi’s model consisted of N gas molecules of
mass m located within a central ‘elastic’ potential U given by the expression
U = 2π2ν2mr2 ,
(16.14)
where ν is the frequency of oscillation of the molecules about the centre r = 0. Considering
only the translational motion of the atoms or molecules in the x-, y- and z-directions, the
energies in the three independent coordinates are quantised so that the energy of each
molecule is
w = hν (s1 + s2 + s3) = shν ,
(16.15)
where s1, s2 and s3 take integral values 0 ≤si ≤s. It is straightforward to show that the
number of different ways Qs of obtaining s for this range of s1, s2 and s3 is
Qs = (s + 1)(s + 2)
2
.
(16.16)
At absolute zero temperature, all the states would be occupied, with one molecule with zero
energy, three with energy hν, six with energy 2hν and so on.
At temperatures greater than absolute zero, the atoms or molecules are distributed among
the available states and Einstein had shown how this calculation is carried out in his paper
on the Bose–Einstein distribution (Einstein, 1924, 1925). If there are N molecules and the
total energy E is to be distributed among them, then


Ns = N,
and
hν

sNs = E ,
(16.17)
with the requirement that Ns ≤Qs. This becomes an exercise in the calculus of variations,
exactly paralleling Einstein’s analysis. The number of possible ways of distributing Ns
atoms among Qs possible locations is given by the usual permutation formula

Qs

and
so the total number of possible ways of distributing the particles is the product of these

showing the characteristic difference between Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics,
the plus sign in the denominator of the former and the minus sign of the latter.
Although the constants A and β could be determined from the statistical formula
S = k lnP and the thermodynamic relation T = dS/dS, Fermi was not certain about the
applicability of the thermodynamic laws at extremely low temperatures and so instead
derived the constants from the asymptotic value of the particle distribution at very large
distances from the origin. At these distances, the density of particles becomes very low and
the energy distribution tends to a Maxwellian velocity distribution. In this way, he found
that the constant β = hν/kT and determined the value of A. Of particular signiﬁcance was
his determination of the pressure of the gas in the extreme low-temperature limit, at which
the pressure is independent of temperature,

16.4 Fermi–Dirac statistics – the Dirac approach
Meanwhile, back in Cambridge, Dirac continued his personal, rather lonely, agenda for the
development of quantum mechanics, but proﬁting from correspondence with his colleagues
in G¨ottingen and Copenhagen, particularly with Heisenberg. The latter recognised that
Dirac’s quantum algebra was a more powerful approach than matrix mechanics. He drew
Dirac’s attention to Schr¨odinger’s papers and sought his advice and assistance in reconciling

16.4 Fermi–Dirac statistics – the Dirac approach
the very different approaches of matrix and wave mechanics. Heisenberg was well aware
of Dirac’s remarkable mathematical skills and he was not disappointed by the outcome.
Dirac’s q-number formulation of the rules of quantum mechanics had the advantage that
he did not need to state explicitly what the q-number was, but could use the formalism
for whatever mathematical object best suited his purposes for the problem at hand. As he
stated in the introduction to his paper On the theory of quantum mechanics (Dirac, 1926f),
‘One can build up a theory [of atomic systems] without knowing anything about the
dynamical variables except the algebraic laws that they are subject to, and can show that
they may be represented by matrices whenever a set of uniformising variables for the
dynamical system exists. . . . It can be shown however . . . that there is no set of uniformis-
ing variables for a system containing more than one electron, so that the theory cannot
progress very far on these lines.’
In his letters to Dirac, Heisenberg described the reconciliation of matrix and wave
mechanics and Dirac fully appreciated the advantages of Schr¨odinger’s theory. Character-
istically, he set about a systematic exploration of wave mechanics, recasting it in his own
language.3 The q-numbers of his theory could be taken to be differential operators, the
pairs of canonically conjugate position and momentum variables qr and pr and time and
energy variables t and W being deﬁned by
qr ,
pr = −i h
2π
∂
∂qr
,
(16.25)
t ,
Wr = −i h
2π
∂
∂t .
(16.26)
Furthermore, he showed that with these deﬁnitions, the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation
reduces to Schr¨odinger’s wave equation and so the whole apparatus of wave mechanics fol-
lowed naturally from his scheme of quantum mechanics. The relation between Schr¨odinger’s
eigenfunctions and the elements of the matrices was also clariﬁed:
‘. . . any constant of integration of the dynamical system . . . can be represented by a
matrix whose elements are constants, there being one row and one column of the matrix
corresponding to each eigenfunction ψn.’
Dirac’s clear and concise exposition of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics provided a
complete demonstration of the equivalence and merits of the different approaches of matrix
and wave mechanics. He had no hesitation in adapting Schr¨odinger’s approach to his way
of thinking.
Dirac had a long-standing interest in developing the quantum mechanics of multiple-
electron systems and in Sect. 3 of his paper concentrated upon the case of the helium
atom and then the statistics of identical particles (Dirac, 1926f). The nub of his thinking is
contained in the following quotation from his paper.
‘Consider now a system that contains two or more similar particles, say, for deﬁniteness,
an atom with two electrons. Denote by (mn) that state of the atom in which one electron
is in an orbit labelled m, and the other in the orbit n. The question arises whether the two
states (mn) and (nm), which are physically indistinguishable as they differ only by the

Spin and quantum statistics
interchange of the two electrons, are to be counted as two different states or as only one?
If the ﬁrst alternative is right, then the theory would enable one to calculate the intensities
due to the two transitions (mn) →(m′n′) and (mn) →(n′m′) separately, as the amplitude
corresponding to either would be given by a deﬁnite element in the matrix representing
the total polarisation. The two transitions are, however, physically indistinguishable, and
only the sum of the intensities for the two together could be determined experimentally.
Hence, in order to keep the essential characteristic of the theory that it shall enable one to
calculate only observable quantities, one must adopt the second alternative that (mn) and
(nm) count as one state.’
This paragraph encapsulates the key concept in his development of what was to become
Fermi–Dirac statistics.
This requirement of the indistinguishability of particles led to inconsistencies in a pure
matrix mechanical scheme, but it had a straightforward interpretation in terms of the
eigenfunction representation of the stationary states of the helium atom. Just as in the case
of Heisenberg’s analysis of the helium atom, if the interaction term between the electrons is
ignored, the Hamiltonian (16.11) is separable so that the wavefunction of the two electrons
can be written
ψm(x1, y1, z1, t) ψn(x2, y2, z2, t) = ψm(1) ψn(2) .
(16.27)
The eigenfunction ψm(2)ψn(1), however, corresponds to exactly the same identical state.
There must therefore be only one row and column of the matrices corresponding to both
(mn) and (nm) and this is achieved by writing the wavefunction ψmn in the form
ψmn = amn ψm(1) ψn(2) + bmn ψm(2) ψn(1) ,
(16.28)
where the amns and bnms are constants, the sets containing only one ψmn corresponding to
both (mn) and (nm). Furthermore, the amns and bnms must be chosen so that the matrix
can represent any symmetric function A of the two electrons. Thus, it must be possible to
expand the wavefunction ψmn in terms of the complete set of eigenfunctions so that
Aψmn =

m′n′
ψm′n′ Am′n′,mn ,
(16.29)
where the Am′n′,mn are constants or only functions of time.
There are then two ways of choosing the set of functions ψmn to satisfy these conditions.
Either amn = bmn, resulting in ψmn being a symmetrical function of the two electrons and so
all the eigenfunctions are symmetrical, or amn = −bmn, so that ψmn is an antisymmetrical
function of the two electrons and all the eigenfunctions are antisymmetrical. Dirac concludes
‘An antisymmetrical eigenfunction vanishes identically when two of the electrons are in
the same orbit. This means that in the solution of the problem with antisymmetric eigen-
functions there can be no stationary states with two or more electrons in the same orbit,
which is just Pauli’s exclusion principle. The solution with symmetrical eigenfunctions,
on the other hand, allows any number of electrons to be in the same orbit, so that this
solution cannot be the correct one for the problem of electrons in an atom.’
In the next section of this very impressive paper, Dirac makes clear the application of
the symmetrical and antisymmetrical wavefunctions to light and particles.

16.4 Fermi–Dirac statistics – the Dirac approach
‘The solution with symmetrical eigenfunctions must be the correct one when applied
to light quanta, since it is known that the Einstein–Bose statistical mechanics leads to
Planck’s law of black-body radiation. The solution with antisymmetrical eigenfunctions,
though, is probably the correct one for gas molecules, since it is known to be the correct
one for electrons in an atom, and one would expect molecules to resemble electrons more
closely than light-quanta.’
Dirac proceeds to determine the equation of state of the gas, under the assumption that
there can only be one or zero electrons associated with a given wave, or eigenfunction. The
waves are divided into a number of sets As, each of the same energy Es. Then, the number
of different ways in which Ns molecules can be distributed among the As waves is given
by the standard relation
ps =
As!
Ns!(As −Ns)! ,
(16.30)
the factorials in the denominator removing duplicates of identical occupancy or vacancies.
The total probability is then found by multiplying the probabilities of all possible states,
subject to the constraints N = 
s Ns and E = 
s Es Ns. Dirac writes
W = s
As!
Ns!(As −Ns)! .
(16.31)
This has reduced the problem to the same standard calculation in the calculus of variations
which was carried out by Fermi (1926a,b) and discussed in Sect. 16.3. The result is the
standard Fermi–Dirac distribution, which in Dirac’s notation is
Ns =
As
eα+Es/kT + 1 ,
(16.32)
exactly the same as Fermi’s expression (16.20). The expressions for the total numbers of
particles and their pressure in volume V follow by the standard procedure for counting the
numbers of states in phase space,

Dirac noted that, since pV = 2
3 E, by eliminating α between (16.33) and (16.34), the
equation of state of the gas could be found. He noted also that the speciﬁc heat of the
gas tended steadily to zero at zero temperature, as required by Nernst’s heat theorem.
The phenomenon of Bose–Einstein condensation does not occur.
Much later in an interview which took place in 1963, Dirac recalled that he had seen
Fermi’s paper, but had not paid much attention to it. Only when Fermi wrote to him about
it, Dirac recalled the paper and fully acknowledged the fact that Fermi had independently
discovered what is now referred to as the Fermi–Dirac distribution.4 While there is no
doubt about the priority of Fermi’s pioneering paper, Dirac’s had the greater impact since it
addressed the issue of quantum statistics in greater generality and was quickly assimilated
into the structure of quantum mechanics.

Spin and quantum statistics
16.5 Building spin into quantum mechanics – Pauli spin matrices
Despite Heisenberg and Jordan’s success in accounting for the anomalous Zeeman effect
(Sect. 16.1), the analysis was only a quantum mechanical extension of the classical expres-
sion for a spinning electron in a magnetic ﬁeld. The spin was represented by a spin vector
s which was added vectorially to the orbital angular momentum L. Pauli fully appreciated
that spin had not been properly incorporated into the scheme of quantum mechanics for
a simple reason. Whilst called an ‘angular momentum’, spin could not be represented in
the same way as orbital angular momentum because the orbital angular moment has three
independent directions, corresponding to rotation about the x-, y- and z-axes, Mx, My and
Mz, whereas the postulates of Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit required only two spin states asso-
ciated with s = + 1
2 and s = −1
2. The full signiﬁcance of this difﬁculty was appreciated by
Darwin (1927a) who wrote,
‘When what is required is to double the number of states of the electron, it is at the least
generous to introduce three extra degrees of freedom and then make an arbitrary (though
not unnatural) assumption which cuts down the triple inﬁnity to two. The electron is in
fact given a complete outﬁt of Eulerian angles, even if it may not be necessary so to
express the matter explicitly. Now we regard the electron as the most primitive thing in
Nature, and it would therefore be much more satisfactory if the duality could be obtained
without such great elaboration.’
Darwin elaborated his proposal to treat what Pauli called the electron’s ‘classically not-
describable two-valuedness’ as a vector quantity which involved two separate Schr¨odinger-
type equations to describe the different polarisations (Darwin, 1927b,c). He doubled the
number of equations so that the four new variables could be treated as the components of
a four-vector in relativity. The scheme was complex and incomplete and was overtaken by
Pauli’s invention of spin matrices which could be incorporated into quantum mechanics,
but this involved a quite different approach to the problem. The essence of what Pauli
(1927b) did is pleasantly summarised in the exposition by Lindsay and Margenau (1957)
who described the problem as follows:
‘. . . the operator corresponding to this new degree of freedom, which we shall metaphor-
ically continue to call ‘spin’, must have only two eigenvalues corresponding to the values
±h/4π of angular momentum in any one direction in which the external ﬁeld is imagined
to be placed. . . . To make a long story short, it is found very difﬁcult to obtain a differ-
ential operator . . . which, acting upon a function of a continuous variable, has only two
eigenvalues.’
Pauli’s approach was quite different from that previously used in quantum mechanics –
he chose a spin variable which has ﬁnite values at only two points. The variable s measures
the spin in, say, the z-direction. The associated spin state function is φ(s). Now we suppose
the range of s is only the two points 1 and −1. It is convenient for visualisation purposes to
think of s as the cosine of the angle between the electron’s spin axis and some direction in
space, so that s = +1 corresponds to alignment parallel to the chosen direction and s = −1

16.5 Building spin into quantum mechanics
to the antiparallel alignment. The state function φ(s) can only have ﬁnite values a at s + 1
and b at s = −1 and so the most general function of φ(s) is
φ(s) = a δs,+1 + b δs,−1 ,
(16.35)
where the δs are delta functions. The state function has to be normalised to unity and so

φ∗(s) φ(s) ds =

(a∗a δs,+1δs,+1 + a∗b δs,+1δs,−1 + b∗a δs,−1δs,+1 + b∗b δs,−1δs,−1) ds,
(16.36)
= a∗a + b∗b = 1 .
(16.37)
Interpreting φ∗(s) φ(s) as the probability that the system is found in the state s, we can
ﬁnd the state function, even without knowing the operator. If the eigenfunction describing
the system as being certainly in state s = +1 is ψ+(s), then ψ∗
+(s) ψ+(s) = δs,+1. Now
substituting this result into (16.35), it follows that a = 1, b = 0 and so
ψ+(s) = δs,+1 .
(16.38)
Similarly, if the system is certainly in the state s = −1, the eigenfunction is
ψ−(s) = δs,−1 .
(16.39)
For the purposes of the spin properties of the electron, (16.38) and (16.39) form a complete
orthonormal set.
We can now determine directly the spin operators σx, σy, σz. Suppose we wish to deter-
mine the spin angular momentum about the z-axis σz. Then, by hypothesis, the eigenvalues
are ±h/4π while the eigenfunctions are given by (16.38) and (16.39). If we write for
economy
σx,y,z = h
4π Sx,y,z ,
(16.40)
Sx,y,z has eigenvalues ±1. Then, the operator Sz must satisfy the equations
Sz ψ+ = ψ+ ,
Sz ψ−= −ψ−.
(16.41)
This is a key point in the argument. Sz cannot be a differential operator because the functions
ψ are not differentiable. Rather (16.41) deﬁnes the operator Sz. When it operates on ψ+, it
leaves it unchanged; when it operates on ψ−, it changes the sign of ψ−.
It is convenient to regard Sz as a matrix. Then, ψ+ and ψ−can be written as a column
vector ψ,

Notice a number of important features of these matrices. Only Sz is diagonal and so
determines the eigenvalues of the spin operator Sz. The others are not diagonal, as must be
the case since diagonal matrices commute and (16.45) shows that the spin matrices do not
commute. Notice that the spin matrices are simply a convenient shorthand for the following
operator equations:

Sz ψ−= −ψ−

It is apparent that ψ+ and ψ−are eigenstates only for the operator Sz, while the operators
Sy and Sx represent mixed states of the ψs.
The spin operators can now be used in Schr¨odinger’s equation following the usual rules
of replacing variables by operators. Consider, for example, the simplest case of an electron
in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B. The energy equation is Hψ = Eψ and we replace the spin
terms in the Hamiltonian H by spin operators. The energy term involving the interaction
between the magnetic moment of the electron μ and the magnetic ﬁeld is
H = μz Bz + μy By + μx Bx .
(16.48)
Using the vector relation μ = (he/mec)s, the corresponding operator for the magnetic
moment of the electron is (he/mec)S and so Schr¨odinger’s equation becomes

16.6 The Dirac equation and the theory of the electron
operator has the property that it converts Schr¨odinger’s equation directly into an algebraic
equation, rather than a differential equation.
The extension to incorporate spin into atomic physics follows by exactly the same
formulation as in the case of the electron in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. For example, for
the case of an electron in an atom in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, we can
write Hψ = Eψ with the Hamiltonian now consisting of two parts, H0 associated with the
operator which appears in Schr¨odinger’s equation for the atom and a second term which
represents the interaction of the electron with the magnetic ﬁeld,
H = H0 + |μ|BSz .
(16.51)
Suppose we represent the wavefunction by the product ψ(q)ψ(s), where q stands for the
three space coordinates and s for the spin coordinates. H0 operates only on the space
coordinates and ψ(q) is the resulting standard solution of the wave equation. Sz operates
only on the spin part of the wavefunction ψ(s). Consequently, by separation of variables,
the solution is found by solving separately the equations
H0ψ(q) = Eqψ(q) ,
|μ|Bszψ(s) = Esψ(s) ,
(16.52)
with E = Eq + Es. For any given stationary state, there are two solutions associated with
the spin of the electron with energies ±|μ|B relative to the case in which there is no
magnetic ﬁeld. There is another pleasant consequence of this result. If the magnetic ﬁeld
is decreased, the two spin states will tend towards degeneracy as B →0 and indeed the
two spin states are degenerate in the limit of zero ﬁeld. In fact, however, because of the
effects of spin–orbit coupling, the electron experiences a magnetic ﬁeld, as discussed in
Sect. 16.1. Therefore, in practice, the degeneracy is lifted and this coupling accounts for
the ﬁne splitting of the energy levels of the atom.
The important result of these calculations was that Pauli had succeeded in incorporating
spin into the scheme of quantum mechanics. This achievement had profound implications
for future studies of the quantum properties of matter since the way was opened up for fully
incorporating spin into many different types of quantum mechanical problem, in particular,
for systems of more than one electron. These studies led to the development of a self-
consistent scheme of spin in quantum mechanics and was able to explain a large number
of phenomena in atomic and condensed matter physics. There was, however, no deeper
understanding of the origin of the spin of the electron – what Pauli had achieved was to ﬁnd
the correct formalism for including spin in quantum calculations, once it is assumed that
the electron is a spin-half particle. The solution came with Dirac’s relativistic formulation
of quantum mechanics.
16.6 The Dirac equation and the theory of the electron
From the outset, there were difﬁculties in incorporating relativity into quantum mechanics.
Sommerfeld’s tour de force in using relativity to account for the splitting of the hydrogen
lines according to the old quantum theory was a remarkable feat, but it was recognised

Spin and quantum statistics
by the pioneers of quantum mechanics that building relativity into quantum and wave
mechanics was non-trivial. We recall that Schr¨odinger had begun with a fully relativistic
version of his wave equation which he had to abandon because it resulted in incorrect
energy levels for the hydrogen atom. With the undoubted successes of matrix and wave
mechanics and the incorporation of spin into the formalism of quantum mechanics, the
need to ﬁnd a route to a relativistic version of Schr¨odinger’s equation was pressing. The
hero of this story is undoubtedly Dirac who continued to pursue his own individual agenda
for the development of a fully relativistic theory of quantum mechanics. He achieved this
goal in a pair of remarkable papers published in 1928 in which he generalised Schr¨odinger’s
equation, resulting in the linear Dirac equation (Dirac, 1928a,b).
There is no question about Pauli’s priority in the discovery of the spin matrices, which
he had discussed with Heisenberg in November 1926. Dirac worked independently on the
problem of electron spin and derived his own version of the spin matrices during the early
months of 1927. He was certainly aware of Pauli’s paper during the summer of 1928 when he
prepared a set of Lectures on Modern Quantum Mechanics for delivery in the Michaelmas
and Lent terms of the 1927–1928 Cambridge academic year. As discussed in Sect. 13.3,
Dirac was also aware that the set of 2 × 2 matrices described by Baker in his Principles of
Geometry (1922) were q-numbers and so would ﬁt naturally into his approach to quantum
mechanics.6 According to Dirac’s reminiscences, he was not interested in incorporating
spin into a relativistic theory of quantum mechanics when he developed that theory in the
autumn of 1927. In his words,
‘I was not interested in bringing the spin of the electron into the wave equation, did not
consider the question at all and did not make any use of Pauli’s work. The reason for this
is that my dominating interest was to get a relativistic theory agreeing with my general
physical interpretation and transformation theory. I thought that this problem should ﬁrst
be solved in the simplest possible case, which was presumably a spinless particle, and only
after that should one go on to consider how to bring in spin. It was a great surprise to me
when I later on discovered that the simplest possible case did involve a spin.’ (Dirac, 1977)
The key role played by Pauli’s introduction of spin matrices is vividly portrayed by Kronig
who wrote in the Pauli memorial volume (Kronig, 1960),
‘In the formulation of quantum mechanics reported so far, the material particles are
considered as characterised by position coordinates only. It now became an urgent task
to incorporate the phenomenon indicated by the term ‘spin’ into the new scheme of
things. The initial step was taken by Pauli himself [(1927b)], who proposed that the
wave function of the electron, besides being determined by continuously variable position
coordinates, should be considered as also depending on a spin variable, capable of two
values only. . . . Thereby Pauli paved the way for the relativistic theory of the electron and
of hydrogen-like atoms which we owe to Dirac (1928a).’
Pauli’s advance was to incorporate the spin of the electron consistently into the scheme of
quantum mechanics by introducing a state vector ψ(s), which as demonstrated by (16.42),
has two components. As van der Waerden remarked,
‘The step from one to two components is large, whereas the step from two to four
components is small.’ (van der Waerden, 1960)

16.6 The Dirac equation and the theory of the electron
16.6.1 The Dirac equation of a free electron
Let us outline how the Dirac equation can be formulated without going into too many
technical details. The objective is to ﬁnd an operator formalism for the relativistic equivalent
of Schr¨odinger’s equation which reduces correctly to the standard equation in the non-
relativistic limit. The requirement of the relativistic theory must be that the equations are
invariant under Lorentz transformations. Schr¨odinger, Oskar Klein and Gordon had all
carried what might be regarded as the ‘natural extension’ of the operator formalism of
quantum mechanics to the relativistic Lagrangian of an electron in an electromagnetic
ﬁeld.
Let us consider ﬁrst the case of a free particle, for which the energy equation is
p2
2me
= E .
(16.53)
To ﬁnd Schr¨odinger’s equation, we replace p and E by the differential operators
p →−ih
2π ∇,
E →ih
2π
∂
∂t .
(16.54)
Schr¨odinger’s time-dependent wave equation follows immediately:
−
h2
8π2me
∇2ψ = ih
2π
∂ψ
∂t .
(16.55)
In the case of a free relativistic particle, the relation between momentum and energy, found
by equating the norms of the momentum four-vector of the electron in the external frame
and the rest frame of the electron, is given by the expression
p2c2 + m2
ec4 = E2 .
(16.56)
Using the deﬁnitions (16.54), this expression becomes
−h2c2
4π2 ∇2ψ + m2
ec4ψ = h2
4π2
∂2ψ
∂t2 .
(16.57)
This is the simplest form of the Klein–Gordon equation, derived independently by
Schr¨odinger, Klein and Gordon. As is apparent, it can only be used for particles with
zero spin. As Schr¨odinger had found in his earliest searches for a wave equation to ac-
commodate de Broglie waves, the solutions give the wrong answers for the energy levels
of the hydrogen atom. Notice also the issue that the equation involves the second deriva-
tive of the wavefunction with respect to time, whereas one of the great virtues of the
standard Schr¨odinger equation is that it is linear, involving only the ﬁrst derivative of the
wavefunction with respect to time.
An alternative approach would be to express (16.56) in terms of E rather than E2, in
which case we would write

hand side of the equation are inside the square root. Dirac had profound misgivings about

this approach to discovering the correct relativistic formulation of Schr¨odinger’s equation.
Speciﬁcally, he found that, although the Klein–Gordon equation could reproduce the same
results for the position coordinates of a particle as in the non-relativistic case, this was not
the case for dynamical variables such as momentum and angular momentum. Dirac was con-
vinced that his transformation theory approach to fundamental quantum processes should
underlie a proper relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics and this had consequences
for how the translation from relativistic mechanics to relativistic quantum mechanics should
be carried out. He stated in his great paper of 1928,
‘The general interpretation of non-relativity quantum mechanics is based on transforma-
tion theory, and is made possible by the wave equation being of the form
(H −W)ψ = 0 ,
(16.59)
that is, being linear in W or ∂/∂t, so that the wave function at any time determines the
wave function at any later time. The wave equation of the relativity theory must also be
linear in W if the general interpretation is to be possible.’ (Dirac, 1928a)
Dirac’s approach to the laws of quantum mechanics through the use of q-numbers had
the great advantage that he did not need to specify exactly what the q-numbers were –
what was important was that, whatever they were, the non-commutative properties ensured
that the non-commutation present at the heart of quantum mechanics would be preserved.
Speciﬁcally, the wavefunctions involved need not be scalar functions of a single variable,
but could be vectors, matrices, tensors, . . . Already, he and Pauli had shown that the spin
matrices provided the solution to the problem of incorporating spin into non-relativistic
quantum mechanics and so he was in the ideal position to extend these insights into the
development of the relativistic theory of the electron.
In his own words, he found the solution by ‘playing around with mathematics’. The
speciﬁc insight came from his considerations of ﬁnding relativistically invariant quantities
which could be built into his scheme of quantum mechanics. He needed the equivalent
of four-vectors, for which the norm, or the sum of squares of the four components of the
four-vector, are invariants. Again, in his words,
‘It took me quite a while, studying over this dilemma, before I suddenly realised that there
was no need to stick to the quantities σ [the spin matrices], which can be represented
by matrices with just two rows and columns. . . . Why not go over to four rows and four
columns? Mathematically, there was no objection to this at all. Replacing the σ-matrices
by four-row and column matrices, one could easily take the square root of the sum of four
squares, or even ﬁve squares if one wanted to.’ (Dirac, 1977)
Dirac worked out the new relativistic theory of quantum mechanics of the electron over
the 1927 Christmas break, using the insights which again must have been provoked by his
close understanding of Baker’s Principles of Geometry (1922). On page 69, Baker writes:

(16.60)
To illustrate what is involved in the derivation of the Dirac equation and its consequences,
we follow the presentation by Lindsay and Margenau (1957). There is an alternative way of
writing the energy of a free electron in special relativity. Let us write down the four-vectors
associated with the momentum and velocity of the electron, P and U respectively:
P =
 E
c , px, py, pz

;
U =

γ c, γ vx, γ vy, γ vz

,
(16.61)
where γ = (1 −v2/c2)−1/2 is the Lorentz factor.7 The scalar product of the four-vectors P
and U is an invariant and so
P · U = γ E −γ ( p · v) = constant = mec2 ,
(16.62)
since P · U = mec2 in the rest frame of the electron. Note that p and v are the relativistic
three-momentum, p = γ mev, and three-velocity v of the electron. Therefore, since H = E,
the Hamiltonian of the relativistic electron can also be written
H = p · v + mec2
γ
= p · v +
+
1 −v2
c2 mec2 .
(16.63)
This is now a ﬁrst-order expression for H.
We now make the following translation into the language of operators:

The momentum operator is the same type of differential operator as before, but the nature
of the α operators is undeﬁned – it is convenient to call them ‘symbols’ using Baker’s
language, the nature of which have yet to be determined. Their algebraic properties can be
found by applying the operator (16.64) twice and then comparing with the results of the
operator substitutions which resulted in the Klein–Gordon equation (16.57). These are two
different ways of describing H 2. Therefore, we require

(16.67)
(α4αx + αxα4) = (α4αy + αyα4) = (α4αz + αzα4) = 0 .
These results tell us that, applying the individual α operators twice, the result is the iden-
tity operator, that is, simply multiplying by one. Secondly, notice that the operators α
anti-commute – in other words, for commuting variables ab −ba = 0, for anti-commuting
variables ab + ab = 0. Thus, returning to the Hamiltonian equation (16.63) and the trans-

(16.68)
where the properties of the symbols αx, αy, αz, α4 are determined by the commutation
relations (16.67). Equation (16.68) is Dirac’s equation for a free electron.
Pauli’s spin matrices are 2 × 2 matrices which describe the two spin states of the electron.
Now we have four αs with the commutation properties (16.67). The simplest way of
accommodating these properties is by 4 × 4 matrices which were derived by Dirac. It will
not prove necessary to write these out for our present purposes. What is important is that
the wavefunction ψ must also be a matrix and the simplest form it can have is as a column
matrix with four elements,
ψ =

Thus, the Dirac equation (16.68) is actually four equations, one for each component of ψ.
To normalise the wavefunctions, we introduce the row vector ψ∗, with components which
are the complex conjugates of ψ. Thus, ψ∗= [ψ∗

Let us now work out the energies of the eigenstates of a free electron according to Dirac’s

reduces to
(E −α4mec2)ψ −hc
2πiαx

dx = 0 .
(16.71)
We note that (16.71) is a matrix equation and so E means E times the unit matrix, α4 is
a 4 × 4 matrix and the components of dψ/dx are (dψ1/dx, dψ2/dx, dψ3/dx, dψ4/dx).
The solution of (16.71) is an exponential function which we can write
ψ = A exp
2πi
h px

,
(16.72)
where p is a number which will turn out to be the relativistic three-momentum of the
electron and A is a column matrix with elements (A1, A2, A3, A4). Now substituting this
solution back into (16.71), we ﬁnd
(E −mec2α4 −cpαx) A = 0 .
(16.73)
Now, we can operate on both sides of this equation with the same operator to the left of A
so that
(E −mec2α4 −cpαx) · (E −mec2α4 −cpαx) A = 0 .
(16.74)
Recalling that we need to preserve the order of the operators and that E is a diagonal matrix
multiplied by E, we ﬁnd

A = 0 .
(16.75)
Now, the last term in round brackets α4αx + αxα4 in the left-hand side of this expression
is zero because of the commutation relations and the second term in round brackets is E
because of (16.73). Therefore, since α2
x = α2
4 = 1,
(−E2 + m2
ec4 + c2 p2) A = 0 .
(16.76)
Notice that what has happened is that the operators associated with each of the terms is
a unit matrix and so the terms in round brackets form an algebraic expression. Since A
cannot vanish, it follows that

The energies of the eigenstates of the electron according to the Dirac equation are one of
its most remarkable features. According to classical physics, the negative energy solution
can be discarded as meaningless. But this is not the case in quantum mechanics which
allows discontinuous transitions between the discrete energy levels which are the solutions
of the wave equation. These negative energy solutions were a paradox, to which we will
return.
Our presentation contains the elements of what Dirac set out in the second section of his
paper. In Sect. 3, he demonstrated that the formalism is fully Lorentz invariant. The real
triumph of the theory came, however, in Sect. 4 of the paper in which the motion of an
electron in electric and magnetic ﬁelds is discussed.
16.6.2 The Dirac equation for an arbitrary electromagnetic field
In compliance with Dirac’s dictum that the equations of classical mechanics are not at fault,
simply the interpretation of the algebra, the natural extension of the scheme is to use the
classical expression for the Hamiltonian in electromagnetic ﬁelds, but now armed with
the new precepts of relativistic quantum mechanics. According to classical Hamiltonian
mechanics we need to make the replacements

and there is no magnetic ﬁeld, A = 0. The solutions of the equations for the hydrogen
atom agreed precisely with the experimentally measured values, including the details of the
ﬁne structure of the energy levels, as demonstrated in the fourth edition of Sommerfeld’s
Atombau und Spektrallinien, which included additional material on Schr¨odinger’s wave
mechanics and Dirac’s papers of 1928 (Sommerfeld, 1929). Note that because the 4 × 4
matrices automatically take account of the spin of the electron and the new formulation is
fully relativistic, the ﬁne-structure calculations include all the effects of spin and relativity.
Sommerfeld’s ﬁne-structure constant appears naturally in these calculations.

16.6 The Dirac equation and the theory of the electron
Let us simplify the notation slightly. We can write
p′ = p + e
c A
;
H ′ = H + eφ ,
(16.82)
and then (16.81) can be written in more compact form as

cα · p′ + α4mc2 −eφ

ψ = Eψ .
(16.83)
This has been written like a vector equation, but it will be understood that the components
of the ‘vector’ α are the 4 × 4 α matrices and the equation is in fact a matrix equation. If
we add eφ to both sides of (16.81), we obtain
H ′ψ = E′ψ ,
(16.84)
where E′ = E + φ – notice that this is no longer an eigenfunction equation since E′ is no
longer a constant.
We now need to carry out some straightforward manipulation of the equations to reduce
the energy equation to a form like that of Schr¨odinger’s equation. First, we pre-multiply
(16.84) by E′ so that,
E′H ′ψ = E′2ψ .
(16.85)
We can rewrite the left-hand side of (16.85) as H ′E′ψ + (E′H ′ −H ′E′) ψ and then,
because of (16.84), the ﬁrst term of this expression is H ′2. Therefore,
[H ′2 + (E′H ′ −H ′E′)] ψ = E′2ψ .
(16.86)
Notice that the operator H ′ is just the expression in the ﬁrst equality of (16.81) or (16.83)
without the term −eφ. The objective is now to evaluate the terms in square brackets in
(16.86).
Let us deal ﬁrst with the term H ′2ψ. We can write this term as
H ′2ψ = c2[αx p′
x + αy p′
y + αz p′
z + α4mc2][αx p′
x + αy p′
y + αz p′
z + α4mc2] .
(16.87)
We use the commutation properties of the α matrices (16.67) and the p′ operators to reduce
(16.87) to the expression
H ′2ψ =

To complete the reduction of (16.88), let us introduce a new set of matrices deﬁned by
σz = −iαxαy ,
σy = −iαzαx ,
σx = −iαyαz .
(16.91)
Then, (16.88) can be written in the simple form

(16.92)
Next, we have to tackle the term (E′H ′ −H ′E′) ψ in (16.86). We use (16.82), (16.83)
and the relation E′ = E + eφ to write this term as
(E′H ′ −H ′E′) ψ = e(φH ′ −H ′φ) ψ = ce(φα · p′ −α · p′φ) ψ ,
= hce
2πi(φα · ∇ψ −α · ∇(φψ)) ,
= −hce
2πiα · (∇φ) ψ = hce
2πiα · E ψ .
(16.93)
E is the electric ﬁeld strength which is assumed to be given by E = −∇φ, in other words,
there is no induced electric ﬁeld and so ˙A = 0. Now substituting (16.92) and (16.93) into
(16.86), we obtain,

16.6 The Dirac equation and the theory of the electron
to compare with the Schr¨odinger equation, we need to separate out the rest mass energy. W
represents the energy level of the electron according to non-relativistic physics. Carrying
out these substitutions and dividing through by 2mec2, we ﬁnd

where we have written φ = e/4πϵ0r and E = W. If we remove all terms in 1/c from
(16.96), we see that it is identical with Schr¨odinger’s equation (16.97). In this case, the
four components of ψ, [ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4], all satisfy the same Schr¨odinger equation, and so
Dirac’s equation reduces correctly to the non-relativistic case.
The additional terms which appear in (16.96) are purely relativistic effects. The vector
potential terms in the second round bracket on the left of the equation are the usual terms
which appear when terms in 1/c are included and the relativistic correction on the right-
hand side, (W + eφ)2/2mec2, is a relativistic correction to the energy W. The remarkable
feature is the presence of the terms in the third round bracket on the left-hand side of

Suppose the electron had magnetic dipole moment μ and electric dipole moment μe. Then,
classically, the electron would have additional energy contributions associated with the
interaction with a magnetic and electric ﬁeld which would be

Thus, the terms in (16.98) correspond to the electron having magnetic and electric moments

Notice that what have been written as products of vectors in (16.98) are in fact 4 × 4
matrices. They are, however, closely related to the Pauli spin matrices. It is straightforward
to derive the forms of the matrices σ and α from Dirac’s paper and these are given in the
endnotes.8 The spin matrices σ are of particular interest. As an example, it is shown in
endnote 8 that the σz spin matrix is

Spin and quantum statistics
This is just an extension of the 2 × 2 spin matrix Sz of (16.46) to a corresponding 4 × 4
matrix which Dirac created by duplicating the 2 × 2 matrix and ﬁlling up the remaining
elements with zeros. In fact, in his analysis of his equation, Dirac recognised that the use
of 4 × 4 matrices duplicated the solutions for the spin states of the electron.
The result (16.100) is the remarkable result of Dirac’s great paper. It shows that, in the
relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics, there is necessarily a magnetic moment
associated with the spin of the electron and that its magnitude is eh/4πmec. This is exactly
the result derived empirically by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit that the magnetic moment
associated with the spin angular momentum had to be twice that associated with orbital
angular momentum.
In addition, (16.100) shows that there is also an electric dipole moment associated with
the electron, but that it is imaginary. Dirac appreciated the problem, but expressed his view
as follows:
‘This magnetic moment is just that assumed in the spinning electron model. The electric
moment, being a pure imaginary, we should not expect to appear in the model. It is
doubtful whether the electric moment has any physical meaning, since the Hamiltonian
in [(16.81)] that we started from is real and the imaginary part only appeared when we
multiplied it up in an artiﬁcial way in order to make it resemble the Hamiltonian of
previous theories.’ (Dirac, 1928a)
It has been worth all the effort to produce these remarkable results which formally
demonstrate the origin of the spin of the electron in quantum mechanics. The words of
Lindsay and Margenau reveal just how remarkable it is:
‘Dirac’s theory, therefore, produces the spin properties without a special postulate, and
this is its major achievement. . . . But equation [(16.96)] also warns us not to take the
electron spin too literally. The equation merely indicates in a formal way that the electron,
if placed in a ﬁeld, has an added energy part of which may be interpreted by saying that the
electron spins. . . . Furthermore, there is no term in [(16.96)] which could be interpreted
as energy due to mechanical rotation. On the whole, then, the situation is more complex
than would be in accord with the simple classical statement: the electron spins.’ (Lindsay
and Margenau, 1957)
16.7 The discovery of the positron
16.7.1 Dirac’s prediction of the anti-electron and antimatter
The existence of negative energy states with E = −mec2 according to Dirac’s theory was a
major concern. According to quantum mechanics, these states could not be ignored. Indeed,
they had to be included if Dirac’s relativistic quantum theory was to reduce correctly to the
classical results. In a letter to Pauli of 31 July 1928, Heisenberg showed that it was necessary
to include these negative energy terms if the correct expression for the dispersion formula

16.7 The discovery of the positron
was to be obtained. Furthermore, Oskar Klein and Yoshio Nishina in their derivation of the
relativistic quantum theory of the scattering of high energy radiation by electrons found that
it was essential to include the negative energy states in order to account for the Compton
scattering properties of electrons at energies hν ≳mec2 (Klein and Nishina, 1928, 1929).
Dirac proposed an ingenious solution to the problem by invoking Pauli’s exclusion
principle. He came up with a picture in which the Universe is so densely packed with
electrons in the negative energy states that they are all ﬁlled and so the electrons cannot
make transitions from the positive to the negative energy states. The proposal was that the
‘vacuum’ was ﬁlled with electrons, what became known as the ‘Dirac sea’. But there might
well be vacancies, or ‘holes’ in the sea, a situation similar to that which gives rise to X-ray
lines when an electron is removed from, say, the K-shell of the atom. On 26 November
1929, Dirac wrote to Bohr,
‘Such a hole . . . would appear experimentally as a thing with positive energy, since to
make the hole disappear (that is, to ﬁll it up) one would have to put negative energy into
it. Further one can easily see that such a hole would move in an electromagnetic ﬁeld
as though it had positive charge. These holes I believe to be protons. When an electron
of positive energy drops into a hole and ﬁlls it up, we have an electron and a proton
disappearing simultaneously and emitting radiation in the form of radiation.’
These ideas were published by Dirac in a paper entitled A theory of electrons and protons in
the 1 January 1930 edition of the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London (Dirac, 1930b).
The theory was immediately challenged on a number of grounds, the most signiﬁcant
being the conclusion demonstrated independently by Igor Tamm, Robert Oppenheimer and
Hermann Weyl that Dirac’s theory predicted that the electrons and holes should have the
same mass. Ultimately, Dirac withdrew his proposal and replaced it by the idea that the
holes would be ‘anti-electrons’. In his words,
‘It appears that we must abandon the identiﬁcation of the holes with protons and must
ﬁnd some other interpretation for them. Following Oppenheimer (1930), we must assume
that in the world as we know it, all, and not nearly all, of the negative-energy states for the
electrons are occupied. A hole, if there were one, would be a new kind of particle, unknown
to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron. We
may call such a particle an anti-electron.’ (Dirac, 1931)
Dirac went further and stated that the protons must be unconnected with the electrons
and that both electrons and protons should have negative energy states, thus introducing
the concept of both anti-electrons and antiprotons (Dirac, 1931). This represented the
introduction of the concept of antimatter into physics.
This famous prediction was only the prelude to the principal concern of his paper
which was entitled Quantized singularities in the electromagnetic ﬁeld and concerned the
theoretical possibility of the existence of magnetic monopoles (Dirac, 1931). He was well
aware of the fact that this concept involved ‘a symmetry between electricity and magnetism
quite foreign to current views’. His predicted value for the elementary magnetic pole
strength was μ = hc/4πe. Despite many investigations, the magnetic monopole has never
been detected.

16.7.2 The discovery of positive electrons – the positrons
The late 1920s and the 1930s were periods of unprecedented discovery in atomic and
nuclear physics. These will be summarised in Chapter 18. Sufﬁce to say that the discoveries
of the positron, the neutron, artiﬁcially induced nuclear interactions, the discovery of the
mesotron and so on were all rapidly built into the pantheon of the new physics with quantum
mechanics at its core. Here we are only concerned with the discovery of the positron.
We need to retrace our steps somewhat to take up the story of the discovery of cosmic
rays which were to provide a natural source of very high energy particles.9 In the early
1900s, it was known that there is a small amount of residual ionisation in the atmosphere
and, close to the surface of the Earth, this could be attributed to the effects of natural
radioactivity in rocks. In their pioneering experiments, Victor Hess and Werner Kolh¨orster
made high altitude balloon observations of the degree of ionisation of the atmosphere and
showed that above about 2 km altitude, the ionisation increases with increasing altitude.
This phenomenon was attributed to some form of cosmic radiation which originated from
above the Earth’s atmosphere (Hess, 1913; Kolh¨orster, 1913). They demonstrated that the
increase was exponential with increasing height, with n(l) ∝exp(αl) and α ∼10−3m−1.
This increasing ionisation corresponded to a path length of much more penetrating radiation
than was found for the most penetrating γ -rays observed in radioactive decays. As Hess
expressed it in his paper,
‘The results of the present observations seem to be most readily explained by the assump-
tion that a radiation of very high penetrating power enters our atmosphere from above,
and still produces in the lower layers a part of the ionisation observed in closed vessels.’
Originally it was assumed that the cosmic rays, as they were named by Millikan in 1925,
were high energy γ -rays with greater penetrating power than those observed in natural
radioactivity. In 1929, Dmitri Skobeltsyn, working in his father’s laboratory in Leningrad,
constructed a cloud chamber which was placed in the jaws of a strong magnet so that the
curvature of the tracks of the charged particles could be measured. Among the tracks, he
noted some which were hardly deﬂected at all and had all the appearance of being electrons
with energies greater than 15 MeV. He identiﬁed them with secondary electrons produced
by the ‘Hess ultra γ -radiation’.
A key technical development for these studies was the invention of the Geiger–M¨uller
detector by Hendrik (Hans) Geiger and Walther M¨uller in 1928. This enabled individ-
ual cosmic rays to be detected and the times of their arrival measured precisely (Geiger
and M¨uller, 1928, 1929). In 1929, B¨othe and Kolh¨orster carried out one of the key ex-
periments in cosmic ray physics in which they introduced the concept of coincidence
counting to eliminate spurious background events (Bothe and Kolh¨orster, 1929). By us-
ing two counters, one placed above the other, they found that simultaneous discharges
of the two detectors occurred very frequently, even when a strong absorber was placed
between the detectors. In one of the key experiments, slabs of lead and gold 4 cm thick
were placed between the counters and the mass absorption coefﬁcient was found to agree
very closely with that of the attenuation of the cosmic radiation in the atmosphere. The

One of the discovery records of the positron. This cloud chamber photograph shows a 63 MeV positron passing through
a 6 mm lead plate and emerging as a 23 MeV positron. According to Anderson, the length of the latter path is at least
10 times greater than the possible length of a proton path of this curvature (Anderson, 1933).
experiment demonstrated that the cosmic radiation consisted of highly energetic charged
particles.
From the 1930s until about 1960, the cosmic radiation provided a natural source of very
high energy particles, of very much greater energies than those produced in radioactive
decays. In 1930, Millikan and Anderson used an electromagnet 10 times stronger than that
used by Skobeltsyn to study the tracks of particles passing through the cloud chamber.
Anderson (1932) observed curved tracks identical to those of electrons, but with positive
electric charges (Fig. 16.2).
This discovery was conﬁrmed by Patrick Blackett and Guiseppe Occhialini in 1933
using an improved technique in which the cloud chamber was only triggered after it was
certain that a cosmic ray had passed through the supersaturated vapour within the chamber
(Fig. 16.3) (Blackett and Occhialini, 1933). They obtained many excellent photographs of
the positive electrons, on many occasions showers containing equal numbers of positive
and negative electrons created by cosmic-ray interactions within the body of the apparatus
being observed. Blackett and Occhialini’s analysis went considerably further than that of
Anderson in that they interpreted the positive and negative electrons as being produced
simultaneously in the interaction of the incoming cosmic ray particle with the material of
the chamber. They stated:

paper of 1933 (Blackett and Occhialini, 1933).
‘In this way one can imagine that negative and positive electrons may be born in pairs
during the disintegration of light nuclei. If the mass of the positive electron is the same as
that of the negative electron, such a twin birth requires an energy of 2mec2 ∼1 million
[electron] volts, that is much less than the translatory energy with which they appear in
general in the showers.’ (Blackett and Occhialini, 1933)
They used Dirac’s calculations to show that the annihilation of the positron would occur
very rapidly resulting in the formation of a pair of high energy photons. Thus, their paper
introduced the concept of pair-production and annihilation of electrons and positrons. These
experiments were conclusive evidence for the positron as predicted by Dirac’s theory of the
electron and the ﬁrst example of the existence of antimatter.

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
In completing the story of spin, we have run far ahead of the continued development of
the understanding of the matrix, operator and wave mechanical approaches to quantum
mechanics. The reconciliation of these approaches was described in Chap. 15, but there
remained the issue of the interpretation of the wavefunction and the deeper implications of
the theory. The understanding came gradually with Born’s interpretation of the wavefunc-
tion, Ehrenfest’s demonstration of the equivalence of the classical and quantum pictures and
Heisenberg’s enunciation of the uncertainty principle. These led to what became known
as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. At the same time, the formal
mathematical foundations of the different approaches to quantum phenomena were set on
a secure foundation thanks to the efforts of Hilbert and many others. These developments
resulted in what may be referred to as the completion of quantum mechanics, in the sense
that it laid the foundations for all the future development of physics at the atomic and
subatomic level – some of these achievements are summarised in Chap. 18.
17.1 Schr¨odinger’s interpretation (1926)
Schr¨odinger regarded wave mechanics as superior to the matrix mechanical approach
to quantum physics, not only because it was based upon the well-known eigenfunction
techniques of classical physics, but also because it was much more visualisable. His ﬁrst
attempt at interpreting the wavefunction appeared in the ﬁnal Sect. 7 of the fourth part of his
great series of papers (Schr¨odinger, 1926f) and was entitled On the physical signiﬁcance
of the ﬁeld scalar. There he identiﬁed the quantity ψψ∗as the ‘weight function’ of the
distribution of charge so that ρe = eψψ∗is the electric charge density. In support of this
picture, he carried out an analysis using the time-dependent wave equations (14.102) to
evaluate the rate of change of charge density according to this prescription. The rate of
change of charge is then

integral:

eψψ∗ρ dV = −

A
heρ
4πime
(ψ∗∇ψ −ψ∇ψ∗) · dA ,
(17.3)
where dA is an element of surface area. Next, we deﬁne the vector S as
S =
he
4πime
(ψ∗∇ψ −ψ∇ψ∗) ,
(17.4)
and then convert the surface integral back into a volume integral using the divergence
theorem,
∂
∂t

eψψ∗ρ dV = −

ρ div S dV .
(17.5)
Taking the time differential inside the integral, (17.4) is the equation of continuity for the
conservation of electric charge in classical electrodynamics,
∂ρe
∂t + div S = 0 ,
(17.6)
recalling that the density of charge is deﬁned as ρe = eψψ∗. S is the electric current
density, corresponding to the quantity J which appears in Maxwell’s equations of classical
electrodynamics.
Schr¨odinger’s interpretation was reinforced by his analysis of the harmonic oscillator ac-
cording to wave mechanics which was presented in Sect. 14.6 and illustrated in Fig. 14.3. His
interpretation was that the particles are represented by wave groups composed of the super-
position of an inﬁnite series of wavefunctions and that Fig. 14.3 represents the oscillation of
the electric charge in a harmonic oscillator. Therefore, just as in classical physics, the oscil-
lating charge emits dipole radiation at the frequency of the oscillator. Schr¨odinger believed
that the motion of the electron in the hydrogen atom could be interpreted in the same way:
‘We can deﬁnitely foresee that, in a similar way, wave groups can be constructed which
move round highly quantised Kepler ellipses and are the representation by wave mechanics
of the hydrogen electron. But the technical difﬁculties in the calculation are greater than
in the especially simple case which we have treated here.’ (Schr¨odinger, 1926a)
But this interpretation could not be correct as was pointed out by Heisenberg and Born.
In general, the wave-packets do spread out in space. Heisenberg showed that the case of
the harmonic oscillator was rather special because the successive energy levels are spaced
by equal amounts. Furthermore, in general, the wavefunction ψ is a function in a multi-
dimensional space and so the interpretation of the motion of the electron as a wave-packet in
three-dimensional space is not viable. Heisenberg was particularly opposed to Schr¨odinger’s
interpretation which seemed to omit many of the very considerable achievements of quan-
tum physics. As he wrote to Pauli in June 1926,
‘The more I ponder about the physical part of Schr¨odinger’s theory, the more horrible
I ﬁnd it. One should imagine the rotating electron, whose charge is distributed over the
entire space and which has an axis in a fourth and ﬁfth dimension. What Schr¨odinger
writes about the visualizability of his theory . . . I ﬁnd rubbish.’

17.2 Born’s probabilistic interpretation (1926)
Soon after, he complained that, while he admired the power of Schr¨odinger’s equation
in simplifying the evaluation of matrix elements in quantum mechanics, Schr¨odinger’s
interpretation
‘throws overboard everything which is ‘quantum theoretical’: namely, the photoelectric
effect, the Franck[–Hertz] collisions, the Stern–Gerlach effect, . . . ’
In addition, there was the problem of understanding the electron diffraction experiments
in crystals and collision phenomena involving electrons. In interpreting these experiments,
it had to be assumed that the waves dispersed, the classical analogue being Huygens’
construction for the interference of light waves, and so how could the stability of the
particle as a discrete entity be explained by Schr¨odinger’s picture? The new interpretation
came from Born’s study of the scattering of electrons by atoms.
17.2 Born’s probabilistic interpretation of the
wavefunction ψ (1926)
In his Nobel Prize speech of 1954, Born explained that he was opposed to Schr¨odinger’s
interpretation:
‘On this point, I could not follow him. This was connected with the fact that my Institute
and that of James Franck were housed in the same building of the G¨ottingen University.
Every experiment by Franck and his assistants on electron collisions (of the ﬁrst and
second kind) appeared to me as a new proof of the corpuscular nature of the electron.’
(Born, 1961a)
Born set about carrying out a quantum mechanical calculation of the scattering of charged
particles such as α-particles or electrons by atoms using wave mechanical techniques. As
he remarked,
‘. . . among the various forms of the theory, only Schr¨odinger’s formalism proved itself
appropriate for this purpose; for this reason I am inclined to regard it as the most profound
formulation of the quantum laws.’ (Born, 1926a)
These remarks were made in a preliminary report of his calculations which were explained
in much more detail in two further papers (Born, 1926b,d). The analysis involved what
became known as the Born approximation, in which the incoming particle is represented
by plane-wave functions incident upon the scattering centre from the positive z-direction.
The scattered outgoing waves are represented by plane waves at inﬁnity. Born treated the
scattered wave as a ﬁrst-order perturbation of the combined unperturbed wavefunctions of
the scattering centre and the incoming particle. If the unperturbed wavefunction of the atom
is ψ0
n(q) and the energy of the incoming electron E = p2/2me = h2/2meλ2, he took the
eigenfunction of the unperturbed system to be
ψ0
nE(q, z) = ψ0
n(q) sin(2πz/λ) ,

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
where n labels the nth wavefunction and q the spatial coordinates relative to the scattering
centre. Then, if V (x, y, z, q) is the potential energy of interaction between the charged
particle and the atom, he could apply the techniques of perturbation theory to evaluate the
amplitude of the scattered plane wave at inﬁnity,
ψ(1)
nE(x, y, z, q) =

m

dω ψ(E)
nm (α, β, γ ) sin k(E)
nm (αx + βy + γ z + δ) ψ0
m(q) . (17.8)
This equation has the following meaning. The superscript (1) means the ﬁrst-order per-
turbation solution for the scattered wave. The double integral is over the solid angle dω,
which is the element of solid angle in the direction of the unit vector, the components
of which are α, β and γ ; δ is an additional scalar phase factor. ψ(E)
nm (α, β, γ ) is a wavefunc-
tion which determines what is now referred to as the differential cross-section for scattering
in the (α, β, γ ) direction. Since all the experiments on electron scattering indicated that
the scattered electrons had a ‘corpuscular nature’, Born inferred that the only possible
interpretation of the expression |ψ(E)
nm (α, β, γ )|2 was that it represented the probability that
the electron, approaching along the z-axis, is scattered in the α, β, γ direction. The wave-
function ψ(1)
nE(x, y, z, q) was then related to the total cross-section for the scattering of the
electron by the atom.
The implications of Born’s calculations were profound. He concluded that quantum me-
chanics does not answer the question, ‘What, precisely, is the state of the system after the
collision?’, but rather the question ‘What is the probability of a particular state after the
collision?’ Thus, Born introduced the concept that the wavefunction ψ and the square of
its amplitude |ψ2| determine the probabilities of events occurring in quantum mechanics.
Born’s thinking was strongly inﬂuenced by Einstein’s interpretation of the relation be-
tween electromagnetic waves and light quanta, the very heart of the wave–particle duality.
According to Born, Einstein interpreted the electromagnetic ﬁeld E(x, y, z, t) as a ‘phan-
tom’ or ‘ghost’ ﬁeld, a ‘Gespensterfeld’, which served to guide the light quanta. The
intensities, and hence the density of light quanta, were determined by the square of the
amplitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In Born’s interpretation, the strict equivalence of
the wavefunction and the properties of electromagnetic waves was reinforced by the com-
parison of the wavefunction of a particle of energy E and momentum p and the expression
for the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave,

where ν = E/h and λ = h/p. The ﬁrst expression is proportional to the amplitude of the
electromagnetic wave and the second to the amplitude of the de Broglie wave associated
with the electron. Since the energy density of the light waves depends upon the square of
the amplitude of the waves, Born translated this into the statement that
‘. . . it was almost self-understood to regard |ψ|2 as the probability density of particles.’
It was soon appreciated that these probabilities are different from those used in classical
statistical mechanics and the theory of Gaussian statistics. Einstein had already understood

17.2 Born’s probabilistic interpretation (1926)
the difference between the statistics of waves and particles in his great paper of 1909
which was analysed in Sect. 3.61 (Einstein, 1909) . According to classical statistics, if p1
and p2 are the probabilities of outcomes 1 and 2 taking place in some experiment, the
combined probability that one or other of them occurring is p1 + p2. Translating this into
Born’s interpretation of the wavefunctions, this would mean that the probabilities would
correspond to |ψ1|2 + |ψ2|2, where ψ1 and ψ2 are the wavefunctions associated with p1
and p2. But this is not the correct rule for the superposition of waves. We need ﬁrst to form
the sum of the two wavefunctions ψ1 + ψ2 and then the probability is given by the square
of the modulus of the joint wavefunction,
p12 = |ψ1 + ψ2|2 = |ψ1|2 + |ψ2|2 + ψ1ψ∗
2 + ψ2ψ∗
1 .
(17.10)
The last two terms are the ‘interference terms’ which give rise to the phenomena of electron
diffraction and the ‘wave’ aspects of the wave–particle duality. Note that these are similar
in form to the terms which appear in the statistical properties of electromagnetic waves (see
Sect. 3.6).
Jammer’s commentary on what Born had achieved is revealing:
‘For Einstein the notion of probability, even as he applied it to reconcile his light-quantum
hypothesis with Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic waves, was the traditional concept
of classical physics, a mathematical objectivisation of the human deﬁciency of complete
or exact knowledge but ultimately a creation of the human mind . . . For Born probability,
as far as it was related to the wave function, was not merely a mathematical ﬁction
but something endowed with physical reality, for it evolved with time and propagated
in space in accordance with Schr¨odinger’s equation. It differed, however, from ordinary
physical agents in one fundamental aspect: it did not transmit energy or momentum.
Since in classical physics, whether Newtonian mechanics or Maxwellian electrodynamics,
only what transfers energy or momentum (or both) is regarded as physically ‘real’, the
ontological status of ψ had to be considered as something intermediate.’ (Jammer, 1989)
Born appreciated that the wavefunction ψ could be expressed as an expansion in a com-
plete, orthonormal set of eigenfunctions which are solutions of the appropriate Schr¨odinger
equation,
ψ =

n
cn ψn ,
(17.11)
with a completeness relation which results from the orthogonality relations for the eigen-
functions,

|ψ(q)|2 dq =

n
|cn|2 .
(17.12)
Born then interpreted

|ψ(q)|2 dq as the total number of particles and the |cn|2 as the
statistical frequency of occurrence of the nth eigenstate of the solutions of Schr¨odinger’s
equation.
This interpretation had a number of immediate successes. Wentzel (1926b) used Born’s
wave mechanical approach to derive the Rutherford scattering formula, while Fax´en and
Holtsmark (1927), Bethe (1930) and Mott (1928) used Born’s approach to study the passage

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
of fast and slow particles through matter. Among the successes of these papers was the
interpretation of the Ramsauer–Townsend effect, the minimum in the cross-section for the
scattering of low-energy electrons in the noble gases, argon, krypton and xenon (Ramsauer,
1921; Townsend and Bailey, 1922) – this phenomenon had no explanation according to
classical physics, but is found naturally in the quantum theory of electron scattering.
Born (1926c) next tackled the interpretation of the time-dependence of the wavefunction
using the time-dependent Schr¨odinger wave equation,
∇2ψ −8π2me
h2
U(x)ψ −4πime
h
∂ψ
∂t = 0 .
(17.13)
Assuming the wavefunctions ψn(x) are normalised, the general solution was taken to be
ψ(x, t) =

n
cnψn(x) exp
2πi
h
Wn t

,
(17.14)
where Wn is the energy of the nth eigenstate. Therefore, at time t = 0, the wavefunction is
ψ(x, 0) =

n
cnψn(x) .
(17.15)
Born considered the result of applying a force F(x, t) to the system which acts only during
the time interval 0 ≤t ≤T . He treated the action of this force as a small perturbation to
the potential U(x) so that U(x) was replaced by U(x) + χF(x, t) where the factor χ is
later used as a small expansion parameter. Using the perturbation techniques described by
Schr¨odinger in Part 4 of his series (Schr¨odinger, 1926f), Born demonstrated that, for the
simple case in which ψ(x, t) consists of only a single eigenfunction ψn(x), the solution of
the time-dependent problem for t ≥T is
ψn(x, t) =

bnm ψm(x) exp

h
Wm t

,
(17.16)
the coefﬁcients bnm being determined by the action of the force F(x, t) during the interval
0 ≤t ≤T . In the spirit of the probability interpretation of the wavefunction, he immediately
interpreted the quantity |bnm|2 as the probability that the system changed from the initial
state n to the ﬁnal state m, in other words, the quantities |bnm|2 represent the transition
probabilities between the states n and m.
Having dealt with a single wavefunction ψn(x), Born could then generalise to the case
in which the initial state is given by (17.15) and so, for t ≥T ,
ψ(x, t) =

n
cnψn(x, t) .
(17.17)
He now worked out the total transition probability from the state n by writing

17.3 Dirac–Jordan transformation theory
for times t ≥T . Using the orthogonality properties of the wavefunctions ψn(x), he derived
the key expression

(17.20)
In carrying out this calculation, Born had uncovered the rules for the determination of
probabilities in quantum mechanics which differ crucially from their classical counter-
parts. Thus, classically, if the transition probability from the state m to n is P1 = |bnm|2
and the probability of that state m occurring is P2 = |cm|2, the joint probability would be
P = P1 P2 = |bnm|2 |cm|2, which is quite different from the quantum rule for the addition
of amplitudes of the wavefunctions to generate the probabilities (17.20) – note the same dif-
ferences between classical and quantum probabilities as described by (17.10). As expressed
by Jammer (1989),
‘. . . Born advanced two theorems which were destined to play a fundamental role in the
further development of quantum theory, its interpretation, and its theory of measurement:
1. the theorem of spectral decomposition according to which there corresponds a possible
state of motion to every component ψn in the expansion or superposition of ψ;
2. the theorem of interference of probabilities according to which the phases of the
expansion coefﬁcients, and not only their absolute values, are physically signiﬁcant.’
These are profound insights into the physical meaning of quantum mechanical calculations.
The amplitudes and phases of the wavefunctions are both crucial in describing quantum
phenomena and consequently complex numbers, which incorporate both amplitude and
phase, are the natural language of quantum mechanics. These results were independently
discovered by Dirac in his important paper On the theory of quantum mechanics using his
rather different approach to quantum mechanics (Dirac, 1926f).
17.3 Dirac–Jordan transformation theory
Born’s probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction was a key advance which was to
be deepened as the formalism of quantum mechanics developed. At the same time, while
the matrix and wave mechanical approaches had been shown to be equivalent, a unifying
mathematical theory was not available at the time Born published his paper in 1926. We
took the story of Dirac’s formulation of quantum mechanics as far as his solution of the
problem of the hydrogen atom in Chap. 13 and then jumped ahead to his discovery of the
relativistic version of the Schr¨odinger equation, the Dirac equation, the magnetic moment
of the electron and the prediction of the positron and antimatter in Chap. 16.

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
We pick up the story from Sect. 13.3 where the elements of what became known as
transformation theory were described in the context of his introduction of q-numbers and
their algebra. There, we encountered the rules for the transformation of the canonical
variables Qr and Pr, which are functions of q-numbers, obeying the following rules in
terms of their Poisson brackets,
[Qr, Ps] = δrs ,
[Qr, Qs] = [Pr, Ps] = 0 .
(17.21)
Then, Qr and Pr can be transformed to another set of canonical variables qr and qs by
relations of the form
Qr = bqrb−1 ,
Pr = bprb−1 ,
(17.22)
where b is a q-number. We observed the strong similarity to the canonical transformations
(12.64) introduced by Born and his colleagues in the matrix treatment of quantum algebra.
As Born remarked,
‘A function S is to be determined, such that when
p = Sp0S−1 ,
q = Sq0S−1 ,
(17.23)
the function
H(p, q) = SH(p0, q0)S−1 = W ,
(17.24)
becomes a diagonal matrix.’ (Born et al., 1926)
The rigorous proof of this result was given by Jordan (1926) who developed the theory for
action and angle variables. Despite these advances, the theory was of limited usefulness
since, in general, it proved difﬁcult to ﬁnd the reciprocal matrices S−1. Furthermore, the
matrix mechanical approach could not deal with the case of constant p. With Schr¨odinger’s
demonstration of the equivalence of the matrix and wave mechanical approaches to quan-
tum phenomena, London (1926) carried over the concepts of matrix mechanics into the
framework of Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics. It was only after this work was completed that
it was realised that London had formulated the problem using closely analogous procedures
to those employed in the use of linear operators in functional spaces, which were discussed
in detail in Chap. 15. Jammer (1989) summarises London’s achievements and what Dirac
published a few weeks later as follows:
‘[The paper by London] started by applying canonical transformations to the wave me-
chanics of discrete eigenvalue problems and ended up with discrete transformation ma-
trices. A few weeks later, Dirac (1926g) published a paper which began by applying
canonical transformations to continuous or discrete matrices in Dirac’s matrix mechanics
of continuous and discrete eigenvalue problems. Dirac’s work thus complemented Lon-
don’s in two respects: it showed, so to speak, the reversibility of the conceptual process
under discussion and generalised it to continuous transformations.’
Dirac had no doubt about the central importance of the transformation theory of quantum
mechanics. As he wrote in the preface to the ﬁrst edition of his classic text The Principles
of Quantum Mechanics (Dirac, 1930a),

17.3 Dirac–Jordan transformation theory
‘. . . the growth of the use of transformation theory . . . is the essence of the new method
in theoretical physics.’
Dirac’s paper contained a number of innovations which were inspired by his appreciation
of Lanczos’s rewriting of matrix mechanics in terms of integral equations (Lanczos, 1926)
(see Sect. 15.2). Dirac appreciated that the elements of the matrices were now continuous
functions and the matrices were continuous matrices.
17.3.1 Discrete and continuous matrices
We can illustrate the similarities and differences between discrete and continuous matrices
by comparing Fourier series and Fourier integrals (Bohm, 1951). In the case of a Fourier
series expansion, a wavefunction ψ(x) can be written as a Fourier series
ψ(x) =

n
an ψn(x) ,
(17.25)
where ψn(x) may be taken to be, for example, the complete set of orthonormal harmonic
functions exp(2πinx/L), where 0 ≤n ≤∞. Thus, if the functions ψn(x) form a complete
orthonormal set, any wavefunction can be expressed as the sum (17.25) over all the discrete
values of n. Now consider a new wavefunction φm(x) obtained by applying the operator A
to ψm(x),
Aψm(x) = φm(x) .
(17.26)
Since the ψn(x) form a complete orthonormal series, φm(x) can be expressed as a sum over
all the components of the series so that
Aψm(x) =

n
anm ψn(x) .
(17.27)
The values of anm can be found using the orthonormal properties of the wavefunctions ψn
in the usual way
anm =

ψ∗
n (x) A ψm(x) dx .
(17.28)
Now the effect of operating on any function ψ(x) can be found by writing
Aψ(x) = A

m
Cmψm(x) =

m
Cm A ψm(x) =

n

m
Cm anm ψn(x) .
(17.29)
In the above exposition, the matrix elements anm are associated with the discrete eigen-
functions ψ.
In the case of Fourier transforms, the discrete functions φn(x) are replaced by continuous
functions. Thus, representing the function ψ by a Fourier integral
ψ(x) =
1
√
2π

φ(k) eik·x dk ,
(17.30)
the orthonormal functions are now the continuous set of functions eik·x and φ(k) are the
corresponding continuous expansion coefﬁcients. The matrix elements akk′ are now found

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
by analogy with (17.28):
akk′ = 1
2π

e−ik·x A eik′·x dx ,
(17.31)
with the key distinction that k and k′ are now continuous functions, rather than the discrete
functions associated with the Fourier components n and m. Thus, for any set of continuous
matrices ψp, we may deﬁne the matrix element app′
app′ =

ψ∗
p A ψp′ dx .
(17.32)
The following expressions, similar to those found for discrete matrices, follow naturally.
Any ψ(x) can be represented by
ψ(x) =

C p ψp dp ,
(17.33)
and so if the operator A acts upon ψ(x),
A ψ(x) =

C p app′ ψp′(x) dp′ dp .
(17.34)
The product rule for continuous matrices becomes
(AB)pp′ =

app′′bp′′ p′ dp′′ .
(17.35)
17.3.2 Dirac’s interpretation of quantum mechanics
Dirac now translated the canonical transformation (17.22) of the dynamical variable g into
G into the language of continuous matrices (Dirac, 1926f). The transformation
G = bgb−1
(17.36)
was written in terms of integrals over continuous matrices as
g(ξ ′ξ ′′) =
  ξ ′
α′

dα′ g(α′α′′) dα′′
α′′
ξ ′′

,
(17.37)
following the rules described in Sect. 17.3.1. The primed and double primed quantities are
continuous parameters, c-numbers, which number the rows and columns of the matrix ele-
ments; (ξ ′/α′) and (α′′/ξ ′′) represent the transformation functions b(ξ ′/α′) and b−1(α′′/ξ ′′)
respectively; g(ξ ′ξ ′′) and g(α′α′′) are dynamical variables and are q-numbers.
One of the objectives of Dirac’s paper was to discover the means of evaluating the trans-
formation functions b(ξ ′/α′) and b−1(α′′/ξ ′′). In the course of his analysis, he introduced
the famous Dirac δ-function. His training in electrical engineering proved to be invaluable
since, as he said,
‘All electrical engineers are familiar with the idea of a pulse, and the δ-function is just a
way of expressing a pulse mathematically.’

17.3 Dirac–Jordan transformation theory
The δ-function had been introduced by Kirchhoff and was used extensively by Oliver
Heaviside in his pioneering studies of electromagnetic theory. The δ-function was deﬁned
in the usual way as
δ(x) = 0
for all x ̸= 0
and

δ(x) dx = 1 .
(17.38)
Dirac was well aware of the fact that the δ-function is what Jammer calls a ‘convenient
mathematical artiﬁce’ and was candid about its mathematical status:
‘Strictly, of course, δ(x) is not a proper function of x, but can only be regarded as a limit of
a certain sequence of functions. All the same one can use δ(x) as though it were a proper
function for practically all purposes of quantum mechanics without getting incorrect
results. One can also use the differential coefﬁcients of δ(x), namely ˙δ(x), ¨δ(x), . . . ,
which are even more discontinuous and less “proper” than δ(x) itself.’
Dirac went on to show that the n-th derivative of δ(x) could be written
 ∞
−∞
f (x) δ(n)(a −x) dx = f (n)(a) .
(17.39)
This result was needed to deﬁne the elements of the unit continuous diagonal matrix
I(α′, α′′) labelled by the continuous parameters α′ and α′′ as
I(α′, α′′) = δ(α′ −α′′) .
(17.40)
Therefore, the elements of the generalised continuous diagonal matrix could be written
f (α′, α′′) = f (α′) δ(α′ −α′′) .
(17.41)
These results were needed in the succeeding analysis in his paper.
The spectacular result of Dirac’s analysis was his demonstration that the function (ξ ′/α′)
was just the appropriate solution of Schr¨odinger’s equation, with the substitutions ξ →q,
η →p, (ξ ′/α′) →ψE(q) and f (α′) →E. In Dirac’s own words
‘The eigenfunctions of Schr¨odinger’s wave equation are just the transformation functions
(or the elements of the transformation matrix previously denoted b) that enable one
to transform from the (q) scheme of matrix representation to a scheme in which the
Hamiltonian is diagonal.’
In fact, Dirac’s analysis was a generalisation of Schr¨odinger’s wave equation and he pro-
ceeded to provide a generalisation of Born’s interpretation of the wavefunction. Born’s
result could be written
ψ(q, t) =

n
cn(t) ψn(q) ,
(17.42)
where |cn(t)|2 was interpreted as the probability that the transition to the state n took place.
Now, Dirac generalised this result to the continuous energy ranges described by his new
formalism so that the equivalent of (17.42) became
ψ(q, t) =

c(E, t) dE ψE(q) ,

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
where |c(E, t)|2 dE was to be interpreted as the transition probability to a state with energy
in the range E to E + dE. Reformulating Born’s treatment of the scattering of electrons by
atoms to his new formulism, he found perfect agreement, provided
‘the coefﬁcients that enable one to transform from the one set of matrices to the other are
just those that determine the transition probabilities.’
Born’s statistical interpretation was also generalised by Pauli in a footnote to his paper
on Fermi statistics (Pauli, 1927a). He stated that the probability of ﬁnding the position
coordinates q1, q2, . . . , q f of a system of N particles in the volume element dq1dq2 . . . dq f
of the conﬁguration space was given by |ψ(q1, q2, . . . , q f )|2 dq1 dq2 . . . dq f , if the system
is in a state characterised by ψ. As Pauli wrote to Heisenberg,
‘Born’s interpretation may be viewed as a special case of a more general interpretation.
Thus, for example, |ψ(p)|2 dp may be interpreted as the probability that the particle has
momentum between p and p + dp.’
He further asserted that, for every pair of quantum mechanical quantities q and β, a function
φ(q, β) exists, the ‘probability amplitude’, such that |φ(q0, β)|2 dq is the probability that
q lies between the values q0 and q0 + dq, if β has a ﬁxed value β0. These insights were to
be used by Jordan to expound the ﬁrst axiomatic approach to the statistical transformation
theory.
17.3.3 Jordan’s axiomatic synthesis of the statistical transformation theory
Inspired by Pauli’s concept of probability amplitudes, Jordan developed an axiomatic ap-
proach to the transformation theory which was independent of London’s and Dirac’s for-
mulations (Jordan, 1927). According to Jammer, the three major axioms of his approach
were:
(1) ‘[the probability amplitude] φ(q, β) is independent of the mechanical nature (Hamil-
tonian function) of the system and depends only on the kinematic relation between q
and β.
(2) the probability (density) that for a ﬁxed value β0 of β the quantum-mechanical quantity
q has the value q0 is the same as the probability (density) that, for a ﬁxed q0 of q, β
has the value β0.
(3) probabilities are combined by superposition, that is, if φ(x, y) is the probability
amplitude for the value x of q at a ﬁxed value y of β, and χ(x, y) is the probability
amplitude for the value x of Q at the ﬁxed value y of q, then the probability amplitude
for x of Q at a ﬁxed value y of β is given by
(x, y) =

χ(x, z) φ(z, y) dz .
(17.44)
In the particular case Q = β, Jordan’s (x, y) becomes Dirac’s δ(x −y).’
In Jordan’s axiomatic approach, p is deﬁned as the momentum canonically conjugate to q
if the probability amplitude ρ(x, y), for every possible value x of p at a ﬁxed y of q, is

(17.45)
Jordan inferred that for a ﬁxed value of q, all possible values of p are equally probable and
vice versa.
Jordan’s somewhat formal and mathematical approach was not readily accessible, except
to experts in transformational theory, but it had some remarkable features. It will be noted
that (17.45) is a solution of the time-independent Schr¨odinger wave equation for a particle
moving with constant momentum. Hence, if the momentum is precisely known, all values
of q are equally likely, a precursor of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Jordan’s great
achievement was that, by adopting the full apparatus of Hermitian operators, he was able
to demonstrate that his theory encompassed not only Schr¨odinger’s wave equation and
Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics, but also the Born–Weiner operator calculus and Dirac’s
q-number calculus. The synthesis of all these approaches was to ﬁnd its ultimate expression
in the application of functional analysis to the formalism of quantum mechanics.
17.3.4 The new perspective
It is worthwhile reviewing what had been achieved as a result of Born’s probabilistic
interpretation of the wavefunction and the Dirac–Jordan statistical transformation theory,
following Jammer’s careful exposition. The achievements of Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg
may be summarised as follows. Schr¨odinger’s discovery of his wave equation was the
route for determining the energy eigenvalues of quantum mechanical systems. Similarly,
in Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics, the solutions for p and q were found for the diagonal
matrices for which the diagonal terms were the energy eigenvalues. The off-diagonal
terms were interpreted as transition probabilities. The observables were the energies of
the stationary states and the transition probabilities. But matrix mechanics could not deal
with the motion of a free electron, nor was the position variable accorded any status in the
scheme, being disguised though the process of taking Fourier transforms.
In contrast, the transformation theory, to quote Jammer (1989),
‘introduced the experimentally required generalisations by postulating that, in principle,
any Hermitian matrix A represents an observable quantity a, on a par with the energy, and
that the eigenvalues of A are possible results of measuring a. Through Dirac’s introduction
of continuous matrices and Born’s probabilistic interpretation of Schr¨odinger’s wave
equation, the notion of position was retrieved.’
17.4 The mathematical completion of quantum mechanics
In 1926, Heisenberg appealed to the mathematicians to take up the challenge of com-
ing up with the mathematics which would underpin the different approaches to quantum

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
mechanics. He was fortunate that the leader of this attack was David Hilbert who was
already well versed in the mathematical issues of quantum mechanics and was a close
neighbour of Born’s at Heidelberg. In late 1926, he began a systematic study of the math-
ematical foundations of quantum mechanics supported by his assistants Lothar Nordheim
and John von Neumann. During the winter of 1926–1927, Hilbert gave a two-hour lecture
every Monday and Thursday morning on the mathematics underlying quantum mechanics
and a summary of these was published in 1927 (Hilbert et al., 1927).
It would take us too far into pure mathematics to describe exactly what Hilbert and his
colleagues achieved, but sufﬁce to say that, as might be expected of the mathematician
who had axiomatised the fundamentals of geometry, he set about coming up with a self-
consistent and mathematically rigorous axiomatic basis for the application of probability
amplitudes in quantum mechanics. They established six axioms which the amplitudes had
to fulﬁl. Hilbert associated an operator with every dynamical variable and the resulting
operator calculus was to be the mathematics of the probability amplitudes associated with
each operator. Hilbert recognised, however, that strict mathematical rigour was not able
alone to encompass the needs of quantum physics. As he stated,
‘It is difﬁcult to understand such a theory if the formalism and its physical interpretation
are not strictly kept apart. Such a separation shall be adhered to even though at the
present stage of the development of the theory no complete axiomatisation has as yet
been achieved. However, what is deﬁnite by now is the analytical apparatus which will not
admit any alternations in its purely mathematical aspects. What can, and probably will,
be modiﬁed is its physical interpretation for it allows a certain freedom of choice.’
Hilbert adopted the integral equation approach to the operator formalism which he had
already pioneered in his paper of 1912 (Hilbert, 1912). Summarising the results of their
analysis, Hilbert and his colleagues found that the condition that the relative probability
density is real and non-negative is that the operators had to be Hermitian. Furthermore,
by introducing Dirac’s δ-function, they were able to derive both the time-independent and
time-dependent Schr¨odinger wave equations for both the energy and position coordinates.
Their transformation theory was fully consistent with Born’s probabilistic interpretation
of the wavefunction, that is, that the function |ψn(x)|2 is the probability that the atom is
found in the nth state and that it is located at x while in that state. The Hilbert–Neumann–
Nordheim reformulation of the transformation theory of Dirac and Jordan included both
wave and matrix mechanics and laid the rigorous mathematical foundations for quantum
mechanics.
There remained, however, the awkward properties of Dirac’s δ-function which appeared
in the reduction of the formal operator description in terms of integral equations into
Schr¨odinger’s wave equation. The legitimising of Dirac’s δ-function was only to take place
very much later.2 Von Neumann therefore adopted a different approach involving concepts
developed by Hilbert on linear equations and used these to provide a new mathematical
framework for quantum mechanics (von Neumann, 1927). This provided the most suitable
formalism for the elaboration of quantum mechanics and its subsequent extensions into
relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory. This involved the introduction of
what von Neumann called Hilbert space, an inﬁnite-dimensional complete separable linear

17.5 Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
space with a positive deﬁnite metric. Within this space, he developed a theory of linear
operators. In one realisation, the operators become functionals as studied in functional
analysis. Likewise, adjoint and Hermitian operators appeared naturally in the theory and
the most general description of Born’s statistical and probabilistic interpretation of quantum
mechanics was described.
The formal elaboration of the technical details of von Neumann’s scheme was a
formidable achievement and, although the overall scheme was laid out in his paper of
1927, it was not until 1929 that he had solved all the formal issues involved (von Neumann,
1929). The modern axiomatic exposition of quantum mechanics is ultimately founded upon
von Neumann’s ground-breaking papers. These cannot be appreciated without consider-
able effort and this qualitative summary does scant justice to his remarkable achievement.
Jammer provides more of the mathematical details, but even he has to refer the interested
reader to the original papers for a full appreciation of their mathematical content.
17.5 Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
While the tools of quantum mechanics were approaching completion, the interpretation
of the quantum mechanical operators and variables was still unclear. Heisenberg’s initial
reaction had been to reject the concept of position and velocity inside atoms as having
no meaning since they could not be observed – for Heisenberg, the only observables at
the atomic level were the emission and absorption properties of atoms, their frequencies,
intensities and polarisations of the radiation. Certainly, the concepts of position, velocity
and momentum could not have their classical signiﬁcance at the atomic level in view
of the fundamental quantum non-commutability relation pq −qp = h/2πi. And yet, the
formalism of quantum mechanics had its roots in classical physics which certainly worked
splendidly for macroscopic bodies. Born’s probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction
offered a compelling way forward, indicating that the outcome of experiments at the atomic
level have an intrinsic indeterminacy. This feature of quantum mechanics was certainly
appreciated by Dirac (1926g) who remarked that
‘One cannot answer any question on the quantum theory, which refers to numerical values
for both the p and the q. One would expect, however, to be able to answer questions in
which only the q or only the p are given numerical values . . . ’
Jordan (1927) likewise stated that ‘for a given value of q all values of p are equally possible’.
Heisenberg and his colleagues fully appreciated that, according to quantum mechanics, it
was
. . . ‘meaningless to speak of the place of a particle with a deﬁnite velocity . . . But if
one does not take it too seriously with the accuracy in using the notions of velocity and
position, then it may well make sense.’ (Heisenberg, 1960)
In a letter to Pauli of 28 October 1926, Heisenberg asserted that it made no sense to
talk about a monochromatic wave at a deﬁnite instant or extremely short period of time.

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
After four months of deliberation on these issues, he came up with a self-consistent solu-
tion to reconcile the classical and quantum interpretations of non-commuting variables, in
particular, in deﬁning the range of applicability of the classical concepts of position and
momentum. These are embodied in what became known as Heisenberg’s uncertainty prin-
ciple. The concepts were contained in a 14-page letter to Pauli who reacted positively and
enthusiastically to its contents. The contents of that letter constituted the bulk of Heisen-
berg’s famous paper on the uncertainty principle which was submitted to the Zeitschrift f¨ur
Physik at the end of March 1927 (Heisenberg, 1927).
Heisenberg used the newly developed statistical transformation theory of Dirac and
Jordan to deﬁne precisely the theoretically permissible values of non-commuting variables
such as q and p in terms of the statistical distributions of their p and q values. As discussed
in Sect. 17.3, this theory had the advantage of being able to deal with matrix elements
which were continuous functions. Heisenberg used results derived by Jordan in his version
of the Dirac–Jordan transformational theory (Jordan, 1927). Jordan took the probability
amplitude for q to be of the following form
S(η, q) ∝exp

−(q −q′)2
2q2
1
−2πip′(q −q′)
h

.
(17.46)
This expression has the following meaning. η is some ﬁxed parameter which will not enter
into the argument. S(η, q) is the probability amplitude that the electron will be at position
q if the mean value of the position is q′ with uncertainty q1. The probability is found by
taking the square of the modulus of the probability amplitude and so
|S(η, q)|2 = SS∗∝exp

−(q −q′)2
q2
1

.
(17.47)
This formulation has the advantage that it results in a Gaussian probability distribution of
possible values of q with ‘uncertainty’ q1.
Next, Heisenberg used the rules of the transformation theory to write down the corre-
sponding probability amplitude for p by using the relation
S(η, p) =

S(η, q) S(q, p) dq .
(17.48)
The function S(q, p) is given by (17.45) and so, carrying out the integration, Heisenberg
found that the probability amplitude for p is
S(η, p) ∝exp

−(p −p′)2

17.5 Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
This is Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle describing the intrinsic indeterminacy with which
p and q can be determined and provides a statistical interpretation of the basic non-
commutability relation pq −qp = h/2πi. As Heisenberg wrote,
‘The more accurately the position is determined, the less accurately the momentum is
known and conversely.’
In fact, the essence of Heisenberg’s calculation is most easily appreciated from the properties
of the integral Fourier transforms of a Gaussian distribution, as was demonstrated by
Darwin (1927d) – a simple analysis using that approach is presented in the endnote to
this chapter.3 It is striking that the Fourier transform approach indicates clearly the origin
of the complex terms in the probability amplitudes (17.46) and (17.49) in Jordan’s and
Heisenberg’s analyses.
Let us convert (17.51) into conventional notation by rewriting the Gaussian distributions
(17.49) and (17.50) in proper normalised form. In order that the distributions be standard
Gaussians, their standard deviations p and q are related to p1 and q1 by p = p1/
√
2
and q = q1/
√
2. Hence, (17.51) may be written
p q = h
4π .
(17.52)
Ditchburn (1930) demonstrated that in fact, because of the choice of Gaussian distributions
for p and q, the uncertainly relation (17.52) represents the minimum indeterminacy of p
and q, the inequality applying for all non-Gaussian distributions,
p q ≥h
4π .
(17.53)
Heisenberg’s great paper on the uncertainty principle was of central importance for many
different aspects of the understanding of quantum physics and for physics in general. Let
us highlight just a few of these consequences.
1. At the most elementary level, the principle tells us the scales on which the classical and
quantum theories are applicable. For example, applying the principle to an electron in
the Bohr model of the atom, its velocity in the ground state, n = 1, is 2.2 × 106 m s−1
and hence its momentum is p = mev = 2 × 10−24 kg m s−1. Therefore, taking p = p
and setting px = h/4π, we ﬁnd x = h/4πp = 0.3 × 10−10 m, roughly the size
of the ﬁrst Bohr orbit – this is no accident. What this calculation is telling us is that, on
the scale of atoms, we cannot know precisely where the electron is at any moment – we
can only describe very precisely where it is likely to be.
2. More generally, the principle tells us that, at any time, we cannot deﬁne the state of any
system at the microscopic level absolutely precisely. Thus, the concept of setting up a
system with a perfectly deﬁned set of initial conditions and then following precisely the
future evolution of the system is not feasible.
3. Another way of expressing this same concern is that causality at the microscopic level
becomes meaningless since the intrinsic uncertainty means that we cannot predict exactly
the outcome of any process. We can make accurate predictions about the various possible

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
outcomes of the experiment, but we cannot state with absolute certainty which will
actually occur.
4. The principle has profound implications for the theory of measurement and this topic
became a major preoccupation in the theory of quantum processes.
5. The principle had a major impact upon philosophy, in many ways demolishing many
of the basic tenets of classical philosophy and logic. For example, the way in which
probability amplitudes and probabilities are evaluated in quantum mechanics tells us that
events which might have happened, but didn’t, can affect the outcome of an experiment.
There is no scope for such constructs in classical physics, but they are an integral part
of the Universe we live in.
6. Perhaps most remarkable of all is the fact that statistical concepts were not explicitly
incorporated into the basic postulates and structure of the theory, and yet the predictions
are all of probability amplitudes and probabilities. Heisenberg should have the last word
on this subject
‘We have not assumed that the quantum theory, unlike classical physics, is essentially
a statistical theory in the sense that from exact data only statistical data can be inferred.
For such an assumption is refuted, for example, by the well-known experiments of Bothe
and Geiger. However, in the strong formulation of the causal law, “If we know exactly
the present, we can predict the future’ it is not the conclusion but rather the premise
which is false. We cannot know, as a matter of principle, the present in all its details.”
It is not perhaps surprising that it took some time before the full implications of Heisenberg’s
calculations were fully appreciated since they ran contrary to many of the most cherished
tenets of classical physics. Perhaps the most important conclusion of these calculations was
the clear distinction between the realms of applicability of classical and quantum physics.
17.6 Ehrenfest’s theorem
An important link between the classical and quantum pictures was provided by Ehrenfest
who carried out a ‘short elementary calculation without approximations’ (Ehrenfest, 1927).
In modern language, he showed that, according to quantum mechanics, the expectation
value of the time derivative of the momentum is equal to the expectation value of the
negative gradient of the potential function, the quantum equivalent of Newton’s second law
of motion. In only a page and a half, Ehrenfest quoted the result of his calculations, without
giving a mathematical derivation, which he regarded as ‘elementary’. The argument goes
as follows.
For simplicity, consider the one-dimensional, time-dependent Schr¨odinger wave equation

Thus, quantum mechanically, the mean, or expectation, value of the momentum is equal to
the product of the mass of the electron times the mean, or expectation, value of the velocity.
This is the exact equivalent of the deﬁnition of momentum in classic mechanics. Notice that
Planck’s constant has disappeared from this expression, despite the fact that the momentum
is deﬁned purely quantum mechanically.

This is Ehrenfest’s theorem which states that the rate of change of the expectation value of
the momentum is equal to the expectation value of the applied force. This is exactly the
same statement as Newton’s second law of motion, but derived purely from the rules
of quantum mechanics. Notice again that Planck’s constant has disappeared from the
expression. Ehrenfest’s theorem provided physicists with a natural continuity between the
quantum description of the action of forces and the world of classical physics.
Ehrenfest’s brief paper, in which only the results of his calculations were presented, was
important in furthering the cause of quantum mechanics among practising physicists. The
fact that the equivalent of Newton’s second law of motion could be derived from a purely
quantum mechanical set of operations made the theory much more acceptable to physicists,
despite the fact that the classical and quantum pictures are built on completely different
foundations.
17.7 The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics
By 1927, most of the elements of non-relativistic quantum mechanics were in place, but
their interpretation was the subject of hot debate among the principal contributors to the new
discipline. At the centre of these debates was Bohr, who continued to ponder deeply about
the meaning of the new vistas emerging from the brilliant analyses of Heisenberg, Jordan,
Born, Schr¨odinger, Pauli, Wiener, von Neumann and many others. The invitation to visit
Bohr in Copenhagen was a singular honour but also a test of the character of the individual
to match Bohr’s inexhaustibility in maintaining an intellectual argument over many hours
or days. Schr¨odinger was invited by Bohr to visit Copenhagen in September 1926 to discuss
his brilliant papers on wave mechanics. The discussion would often last whole days, leaving
Schr¨odinger in a state of exhaustion. The debates concerned the rationalisation of Bohr’s

insistence upon the concept of ‘quantum jumps’ and Schr¨odinger’s conviction that these
were unphysical and should be replaced by his continuous wavefunctions. At one point, in
exasperation, Schr¨odinger is reported to have stated,
‘If one has to stick to this damned quantum jumping, then I regret ever having become
involved in this thing.’
In conciliatory mood, Bohr responded
‘But we others are very grateful to you that you were, since your work did so much to
promote this theory.’
There is a large literature on the vicissitudes associated with the interpretation of quantum
mechanics, many of the key protagonists holding different views. Einstein was particularly
aggressive in his opposition to the probability interpretation of the wavefunction, his con-
viction of the incompleteness of the new quantum mechanics being expressed by his
well-known remark in a letter to Born of 4 December 1926,
‘I, at any rate, am convinced that He (God) does not throw dice.’
17.7.1 Bohr and complementarity
Bohr remained the godfather of the new discipline of quantum mechanics and agonised
over the interpretation of the new scheme of things. He had held out against the reality of the
wave–particle duality, particularly Einstein’s concept of light quanta, but eventually he con-
ceded, following the decisive results of the Bothe–Geiger experiments and the consequent
rejection of the Bohr–Kramers–Slater picture (see Sect. 10.2). For Bohr, the wave–particle
duality for radiation was at the heart of the new conceptions of quantum mechanics – how
was it possible for radiation to possess simultaneously both wave properties, as exhibited
by the phenomena of interference and diffraction, and the particle properties found in the
photoelectric and Compton effects? To resolve this apparent paradox, he introduced the
concept of complementarity, a conception which was designed as what Jammer calls a ‘new
logical instrument’ for the interpretation of classical and quantum phenomena. The words
of Jammer give as close to a deﬁnition of complementarity as will be found in the literature:
‘[Bohr] called it “complementarity”, denoting thereby the logical relation between two
descriptions or sets of concepts which, though mutually exclusive, are nevertheless both
necessary for an exhaustive description of the situation. In Heisenberg’s reciprocal un-
certainty relations he saw a mathematical expression which deﬁnes the extent to which
complementary notions may overlap, that is, may be applied simultaneously, but, of
course, not rigorously. The uncertainty relations, Bohr contended, tell us the price we
have to pay for violating the rigorous exclusion of notions, the price for applying to the
description of a physical phenomenon two categories of notions which, strictly speaking,
are contradictory to each other.’ (Jammer, 1989)
Bohr went on to relate the notion of complementarity to the issue of measurement in
quantum mechanics. In his interpretation, it was now impossible to separate out what was

The interpretation of quantum mechanics
being observed from the means by which it was observed. He contended that measuring
instruments produce results which are expressed in classical terms and that by observing the
system in different ways, complementary variables may be determined which however can
only be determined and reconciled according to the limitations imposed by Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle.
After a number of years in which he had published little on quantum mechanics, Bohr
ﬁrst described his new understanding at the 1927 International Congress of Physics held in
Como to celebrate the centenary of the death of Alessandro Volta, who had been born and
died there (Bohr, 1928). In his address The quantum postulate and the recent development of
quantum theory, Bohr set out his concepts for the ﬁrst time and these might be considered
a primitive form of what was later to be known as the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics. Bohr’s arguments did not make a strong immediate impression upon
his audience, but the emphasis upon the role of experiment in deﬁning what was measurable
at the elementary level was of lasting importance.
Bohr gave no exact deﬁnition of the principle of complementary in his various expositions
of the concept, and indeed later used the ﬂexibility of its deﬁnition to include areas outside
physics, as described in Pais’s biography of Bohr (Pais, 1991). Pauli sharpened up the
concept to give a precise operational meaning to the principle (Pauli, 1933). He stated
‘[two classical concepts – and not two modes of description – are] complementary if the
applicability of one (for example, position coordinate) stands in the relation of exclusion
to that of the other (for example, momentum).’
There ensued a debate among theorists, such as von Weizs¨acker and Feyerabend about the
exact meaning of Bohr’s complementarity, largely engendered by the vagueness of Bohr’s
deﬁnition of the conception. For some theorists its very vagueness was a virtue in allowing
ﬂexible interpretations of the relation of non-commuting variables to measurement and
observation.
17.7.2 Dirac notation
The ﬁrst complete exposition of the formal foundations of quantum mechanics was given
by Dirac in his classic text The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, the ﬁrst edition of which
was published in 1930 (Dirac, 1930a). Dirac’s book was an extraordinary achievement
setting out in detail the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics axiomatically.
The remarkable feature of his exposition is the constant interplay between the formal
structure of the statistical transformation theory and the need to account for observed
physical phenomena. In the ﬁrst edition, Dirac used the same notation he had adopted in
his papers from 1925 to 1930. This exposition of the principles of quantum mechanics
used the language and techniques of statistical transformation theory which he developed
from his pioneering geometric-algebraic approach discussed in Chap. 14 and developed in
Sect. 17.3. The various manipulations of operators and wavefunctions developed over the
last eight chapters were the tools used in Dirac’s exposition of 1930.
In 1939, Dirac invented the bra and ket notation which resulted in a signiﬁcantly more
elegant notation for the underlying algebraic structure of the theory (Dirac, 1939). This new

17.7 The Copenhagen interpretation
formalism was incorporated into the third edition (Dirac, 1947) and remained essentially
unchanged in the subsequent fourth and deﬁnitive edition (Dirac, 1958). Let us summarise
the translation from the notation of 1930 to the post-1939 version. This also completed
the transformation of the theory from a more-or-less self-consistent set of assumptions and
rules into the modern axiomatic exposition of quantum mechanics. Dirac’s notation works
as follows:
r The wavefunction (x, t) incorporates all knowledge about the evolution of the system.
In general, it is deﬁned in an inﬁnite dimensional function space, what is referred to as
Hilbert space. (x, t) can be thought of as a vector in this space. (x, t) may consist of
functions of the spatial coordinates and time as well as spin coordinates. It is referred to
as the state of the system, or the state vector and is written |⟩, meaning ‘the state with
state function (x, t)’. In the time-independent case, lower case Greek symbols are used
so that |ψ⟩means ‘the time-independent state with state function ψ(x)’.
r In carrying out the evaluation of the integrals over complete sets of eigenfunctions, we
need the complex conjugates of the wavefunctions in order to form integrals such as
 ∞
−∞
φ∗(x) ψ(x) dx .
(17.68)
Dirac introduced the notation ⟨φ| to rewrite the integral (17.68) as
 ∞
−∞
φ∗(x) ψ(x) dx = ⟨φ|ψ⟩,
(17.69)
so that |ψ⟩and ⟨φ| are shorthand notation for the wavefunction ψ and the complex
conjugate of the wavefunction φ respectively and the combination of the two, written as
⟨φ|ψ⟩, is an abbreviation for the integral (17.69). If the wavefunction ψ is normalised,
⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1. In Dirac’s language of 1939,
◦|ψ⟩is called a ket vector,
◦⟨ψ| is called a bra vector, the complex conjugate of ψ,
◦⟨φ|ψ⟩is called a Dirac bra(c)ket, or inner product of the state vectors.
r It is conventional to write operators with a ‘hat’ so that the operator A is written ;
A. Then,
the state found by operating upon ψ with ;
A is denoted | ;
Aψ⟩. We can also deﬁne the bra
vector corresponding to this state by analogy with the relation φ∗(x) →⟨φ| so that
( ;
A ψ)∗= ⟨;
A ψ| .
(17.70)
The integral corresponding to

and |φ⟩. Because of the rules for forming the complex conjugates of the states and the

An integral part of the formalism is that the operator ;

operators, ;
A = ;
A † and so
⟨A⟩∗= ⟨ψ| ;
A|ψ⟩∗= ⟨ψ| ;
A †|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ| ;
A|ψ⟩= ⟨A⟩.
(17.75)
r In the Dirac notation, the eigenvalue equation is written
| ;
A|ψ⟩= a|ψ⟩.
(17.76)
Thus, |ψ⟩is the eigenstate corresponding to the operator ;
A and a is the associated
eigenvalue; ψ(x) is the corresponding eigenfunction of ;
A. As examples of operators in
the Dirac notation, the momentum operator is ;p ≡(h/2πi) ∂/∂x in one dimension and
the Hamiltonian operator is
;
H = ;T + ;V =
h2
8π2me
∇2 + V (x) ,
(17.77)
where the two terms correspond to the kinetic energy operator ;T and the scalar potential
energy operator ;V . Thus, the eigenvalue equation for the stationary states of a system is
given by the solution of the eigenfunction equation
;
H ψ = ;T ψ + ;V ψ =
h2
8π2me
∇2ψ + V (x)ψ = Eψ ,
(17.78)
which is the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation with energy eigenvalues E.
Dirac’s great book repays close reading. The various complex pathways by which the
new understandings were obtained are bypassed and the structure no longer depended upon
concepts such as the correspondence principle. Just as Newtonian mechanics needed ﬁrst the
development of differential and integral calculus and then the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
approaches to perfect the mathematical structures, so Dirac’s book is an account of the
non-commutative algebra of operators. On ﬁrst encounter, it appears to be a somewhat
formal mathematical approach to quantum mechanics, but close reading shows how Dirac’s
thought was strongly governed at each stage by the need to account for a relatively small
number of phenomena which contain the essence of what the algebra had to encompass. It
is one of the great books of physics.

17.7 The Copenhagen interpretation
17.7.3 The Copenhagen interpretation
In due course, the rules of quantum mechanics were hammered out into a self-consistent
set of postulates which form the basis of what may be called the axiomatic approach to
quantum mechanics. It is often referred to as the Copenhagen interpretation and is based
upon the results of the many different analyses described in the last seven chapters. It has
to be said that exactly what constitutes the Copenhagen interpretation is a matter of debate,
but the following sets of rules, are fully consistent with what Bohr and his collaborators
eventually agreed upon.4
r The most complete knowledge we can have of a system is represented by the state vector
|⟩.
r To every observable A there corresponds a Hermitian operator ;A. The result of a mea-
surement of A must be one of the eigenvalues of ;A.
r If the eigenvalue a corresponds to the eigenstate |φ⟩, then the probability of obtaining
the result a when the system is in the state  is |⟨φ|⟩|2.
r As a result of the measurement of A in which the result a is obtained, the state of the
system is changed to the corresponding eigenstate |φ⟩.
r Between measurements, the state vector |⟩evolves with time according to the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation
ih
2π
∂
∂t |⟩= ;
H |⟩.
(17.79)
The consequences of these rules are profound. For example, we described in Sect. 17.2.2
how the expectation value of any measurement is found for the observable A which has
state vector |ψ⟩= 
j c j|φ j⟩in the time-independent case. The result of any particular
measurement is that the system is found in the eigenstate |φ j⟩with eigenvalue a j and that
the probability of that value being obtained is |c j|2 = |⟨φ j|ψ⟩|2. Hence, the expectation
value, in the sense of the mean value of a large number of experiments, is ⟨A⟩= 
j a j|c j|2.
But, once the measurement is made, the system is in one particular state |φ⟩j. The effect
of the measurement of the observable A is to force the system into one of the eigenstates
of ;A, with the result that c j is now 1 and all the other cis for which i ̸= j are zero. This is
a key feature of the way in which quantum mechanics works. This process of forcing the
system into one of the possible state functions is referred to as the collapse or reduction of
the wavefunction.
This is one of the most remarkable results of the formalism of quantum mechanics. In
terms of amplitudes, the theory is linear – it is only when an experiment is made that the
system is forced into one of the eigenstates and the a priori probabilities of this happening
are given by the square of the modulus of the probability amplitudes.

The aftermath
We have reached the goal I set myself when this journey began. From about 1927 onwards,
the quantum theory in its modern guise for non-relativistic quantum mechanics was essen-
tially complete, although there remained problems of interpretation which took a number
of years to unravel – some of them are still hotly debated. But much of the apparatus was
already in place and the subsequent developments changed completely the face of physics.
Jammer (1989) summarises the achievement as follows:
‘Since 1927, the development of quantum mechanics and its applications to molecular
physics, to the solid state of matter, to liquids and gases, to statistical mechanics, as well as
to nuclear physics, demonstrated the overwhelming generality of its methods and results.
In fact, never has a physical theory given a key to the explanation and calculation of
such a heterogeneous group of phenomena and reached such a perfect agreement with
experience as has quantum mechanics.’
As noted by Mehra and Rechenberg (2001), the 1930s also saw the beginning of the com-
partmentalisation of physics into separate quantum disciplines. Thus, during the 1930s, with
the general acceptance and success of quantum mechanics, the quantum physicists began
to specialise in disciplines such as atomic physics, molecular physics, solid state physics,
including metal and semiconductor physics, condensed matter physics and low tempera-
ture physics, while at high energies, nuclear, particle and cosmic ray physics developed as
disciplines in their own right. Whereas the pioneers of quantum mechanics regarded the
whole province of quantum physics as their domain, the various branches of quantum
physics became fragmented into these specialisms, not so different from those encountered
in any physics department today.
The years up to the outbreak of the Second World War were a golden age of theoretical
and experimental physics. Let us outline brieﬂy some of the major achievements of theory,
experiment, observation and the interpretation of these data. These topics are now part of the
basic infrastructure of modern physics and the details of the experiments and calculations
can be found in the standard textbooks.
18.1 The development of theory
Theoretical quantum mechanics developed into the various subdisciplines mentioned above,
but a key priority for theory and experiment was the development of a formalism which
could encompass the quantisation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld as well as the mechanics

18.1 The development of theory
and dynamics of particles. In fact, the ﬁrst attempt to include the quantisation of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld into the scheme of matrix mechanics appeared in the last sections of
the pioneering papers by Born and Jordan (1925b) and in the Three-Man Paper (Born et al.,
1926). In this approach, the electromagnetic waves were treated as a system of harmonic
oscillators. The interaction of radiation and matter next appeared in Dirac’s treatment
of Compton scattering using a relativistic version of his q-number approach to quantum
mechanics (Dirac, 1926c). In his next assault on the quantum theory of radiation, Dirac
extended the theory of the emission and absorption of radiation by requiring the q-numbers
which characterise the radiation to be the Fourier components of the energy Er and its
conjugate ‘phase’ θr and that they should satisfy the commutation relations
θr Er −Erθr = ih
2π .
(18.1)
His achievement in this paper was his demonstration that this procedure led to the determi-
nation of the values of Einstein’s A and B coefﬁcients (Dirac, 1927). According to Jammer
(1989), Dirac’s procedure for quantising the electromagnetic ﬁeld marked the beginning
of quantum electrodynamics. The derivation of the Dirac equation and the predictions of
the magnetic moment of the electron and positrons were spectacular achievements (Dirac,
Dirac (1928a,b), see Sect. 16.6) but the electromagnetic ﬁeld itself still had to be built
into a consistent theory of relativistic quantum mechanics. In the succeeding years, Dirac,
Heisenberg, Jordan, Klein and Pauli made major inroads into the proper formulation of
quantum electrodynamics, step-by-step incorporating the features now familiar in their
modern contexts.
To mention only a few of the steps along the way, in 1928, Jordan and Pauli published
their paper on the quantum electrodynamics of charge-free ﬁelds in which they extended
Dirac’s formalism by introducing non-commuting q-numbers for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
and casting them in relativistically invariant form (Jordan and Pauli, 1928). Heisenberg
and Pauli returned to the attack in early 1929. They had already introduced a relativistic
Lagrangian in which the quantum ﬁeld variables are given in a form similar to that used in
classical mechanics. The problem they faced was that the formalism led to the conjugate
momentum of the ﬁelds being identically zero. This was remedied by a ‘trick’ discovered
by Heisenberg of adding an extra term to the Lagrangian which was multiplied by the small
quantity ε. This resolved the problem of the vanishing conjugate momentum and led to
sensible results in the limit ε →0. The result of these endeavours was a long and important
paper by Heisenberg and Pauli (1929), which begins with the words,
‘So far it has not been possible to connect in quantum theory the mechanical and electrody-
namic laws, electrostatic and magnetostatic interactions on the one hand, and interactions
mediated by radiation on the other hand, in a uniﬁed point of view. In particular, one
has not proceeded to take into account correctly the ﬁnite velocity of propagation of the
actions due to electromagnetic forces.’
Their paper set out to provide this uniﬁed view and take account of retardation effects
in radiation problems. The three chapters describe the ‘general methods’, the derivation
of the ‘fundamental equations of the theory for electromagnetic and matter ﬁelds’ and

The aftermath
‘approximation methods for the integration of the equations and physical applications’.
The new relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory contained both Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein
statistics.
Pauli and Heisenberg sought to continue along the lines of their paper of 1929 and were
stimulated by the publication of Weyl’s Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik (1928) to
generalise the group-theoretical methods of Weyl to the case of wave ﬁelds. This had the
effect of simplifying the presentation of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory and of elimi-
nating the ‘trick’ of the vanishing ε which Heisenberg had introduced in their ﬁrst paper
(Heisenberg and Pauli, 1930).
In classical mechanics, there is a close relation between the symmetry properties of a
mechanical system and conservation laws.1 A much more general approach to the problems
of symmetry under different types of mathematical operation is provided by group theory.
Already in his paper of June 1926, Heisenberg had made use of group theoretical results in
his study of the many-body problem and resonances in quantum mechanics (Heisenberg,
1926a). These ideas were to be taken very much further by the young Eugene Wigner.
In 1927, he published an ambitious paper entitled Some consequences from Schr¨odinger’s
theory for the term structures (Wigner, 1927) in which group-theoretical concepts were
applied to Schr¨odinger’s wave equation. From these considerations, Wigner was able to
derive the selection rules for azimuthal quantum numbers as well as the term structure
and selection rules when atoms are subject to electric and magnetic ﬁelds. He concluded
triumphantly that he been able to
‘demonstrate that one can, by rather simple symmetry considerations with the Schr¨odinger
equation, already explain an essential part of the purely qualitative spectroscopic experi-
ence.’
In his subsequent development of the full power of group theory as applied to quantum
mechanical problems, he was joined by his colleague John von Neumann. The full signif-
icance of Wigner’s innovations can be appreciated from the remark of van den Waerden,
himself a specialist in group theory, that
‘Wigner’s paper seems to be the ﬁrst in which group theory was applied to [quantum]
physics. In this paper, some rules of term zoology were deduced, but the spin was left out of
account. In the papers of von Neumann and Wigner [Neumann and Wigner (1928a,b,c)],
the whole apparatus of group characters and representations was put into action and the
complete system of term zoology, including selection rules, intensity formulae [and] Stark
effect was developed.’ (van der Waerden, 1960)
For example, in the third paper by von Neumann and Wigner, the expression for the Land´e
g-factor was derived purely from group theory, speciﬁcally from the group-theoretical
multiplication formula, which resulted in
g = 1 + j( j + 1) −l(l + 1) + s(s + 1)
2 j( j + 1)
.

18.1 The development of theory
The works of Wigner and Neumann were incorporated into Weyl’s Gruppentheorie und
Quantenmechanik (1928), Weyl stating that he had independently derived many of the key
results.
The group-theoretical approach opened up new ways of tackling the problem of the
origin of the chemical bond. Hund had made use of symmetry arguments derived from
the group-theoretical aspects of Heisenberg’s and Wigner’s papers of 1927 to interpret the
binding of atoms in molecules (Hund, 1927c). These arguments provided a more visualisable
approach to the combination of wavefunctions for the atoms of a molecule. A pure group-
theoretical approach was adopted by Walter Heitler and Fritz London who investigated the
forces between two neutral atoms using Heisenberg’s exchange integral. The result was an
explanation for the homopolar covalent bonds found in molecular chemistry (Heitler and
London, 1927).
Following this advance, Heitler went on in his next paper to explore the full capabilities
of group theory for quantum chemistry (Heitler, 1927). What he did is best explained in
his own words.
‘London did not join me in that: he thought is was too complicated. Wigner’s paper
had appeared by that time, and I saw immediately that it could be useful for further
development of the theory of chemical bonds, but London wanted to go on in his own
more intuitive way . . .
So I started to study group theory. I ﬁrst read the book by Speiser . . . Later on I read
the papers by Schur and other people. The very nice thing was that the mathematicians
had prepared group theory so well for the use of the physicists without knowing it that
sometimes I could just copy, word for word, pages from a group-theory paper and use them
for my purposes.’ (Heitler interview: the Archives for the History of Quantum Physics,
1963)
Among the achievements of this paper was his demonstration that the closed shells of an
atom can result in no new splittings of the energy levels, but only a shift in the levels. As
he remarked,
‘[This conclusion is] solely responsible for the existence of the periodic system with
homologous sequences, in which the elements exhibit homologous spectroscopic and
chemical properties.’
These events reﬂect the fact that the theory of quantum mechanics was becoming increas-
ingly mathematically sophisticated and involved mathematics which was often beyond the
reach of the average physicist. Slater was among those disaffected by these developments,
referring to the group theory approach as the ‘Gruppenpest’, the pest of group theory
(Slater, 1975). But Slater did not simply complain, but converted the formalism of many-
electron atoms into a viable scheme for the determination of the energy levels and structure
of atoms. He realised that the atomic properties of atoms including their spin properties
could be written entirely in terms of antisymmetric wavefunctions, thus explicitly includ-
ing the Pauli exclusion principle (Slater, 1929). Combining these concepts with Douglas
Hartree’s ‘self-consistent ﬁeld’ approach to the determination of atomic structure (Hartree,
1927a,b) led to many important results in the understanding of atoms and their spectra. For

The aftermath
example, he was able to recover Heitler’s result that ﬁlled shells make no contribution to
the splitting of the energy levels of atoms. With some pride Slater recalled,
‘As soon as this paper became known, it was obvious that a great many other physicists
were as disgusted as I had been with the group-theoretical approach to the problem. As
I heard later, there were remarks made such as “Slater has slain the ‘Gruppenpest’ ”. I
believe that no other piece of work I had done was so universally popular.’ (Slater, 1975)
Despite these somewhat reactionary remarks, group theory was there to stay in the armoury
of weapons to be used in tackling problems in quantum mechanics.
To complete the story of the understanding of spin up to 1940, the ﬁnal piece of the jigsaw
was the relation of the spin of the particles to their statistical properties. This connection
was discovered in the studies of Markus Fierz who worked as an assistant to Pauli from
1936 to 1940. Fierz analysed the properties of quantum ﬁeld theories and, using the spinor
calculus of van der Waerden (1932), found that
‘Particles with integral spin must always satisfy Bose statistics and particles with half-
integral spin Fermi statistics.’ (Fierz, 1939)
These results were consolidated in joint papers with Pauli in 1939 and 1940 (Fierz and
Pauli, 1939; Pauli and Fierz, 1940). An even more general approach which gave the same
result was developed by Frederick Joseph Belinfante who introduced undons. These objects
could describe both integral and half-integral spin particles (Pauli and Belinfante, 1940).
18.2 The theory of quantum tunnelling
One of the earliest triumphs of quantum mechanics was the theory of quantum mechanical
tunnelling as applied to molecules and to the emission of α-particles in radioactive decays.2
Friedrich Hund’s objective was to understand the nature of the stationary states of diatomic
molecules. He modelled the potential well experienced by the electrons in molecules by a
double-well potential (Fig. 18.1) in order to work out the eigenstates of molecules (Hund,
1927a,b,d). He found that the superposition of the even ground state and the odd ﬁrst excited
state shown in Fig. 18.1b resulted in a non-stationary state in which the electron oscillated
back and forth between the two potential wells, the period T of the oscillation being

(18.3)
where τ = 1/ν is the period of oscillation of the electron in one of the potential wells when
they are widely separated and V is the height of the potential barrier. Notice the exponential
dependence of the oscillation frequency upon the height of the potential barrier.
In the same year, Lothar Nordheim published a paper on barrier penetration associated
with the thermionic emission of electrons from a heated metal surface (Nordheim, 1927).
In his calculations, he introduced the concept of a rectangular potential barrier, a picture
now familiar in every quantum mechanics textbook (Fig. 18.2).

this value, 4.2 MeV. Gamow realised that this was an example of barrier penetration in
quantum mechanics. The nuclear potential could be modelled as a deep rectangular poten-
tial well, as illustrated in Fig. 18.3a. Then, according to the quantum calculation for barrier
penetration, although the barrier is impenetrable according to classical physics, there is a

of the particle. This is illustrated by the diagram from Gamow’s paper (Fig. 18.3a) which
shows the amplitude of the wavefunction on both sides of the barrier and within it, another
diagram which appears in all the standard textbooks. In fact, Gamow and independently
Ronald Gurney and Edward Condon almost simultaneously solved Schr¨odinger’s equation
for the nuclear potential shown in Fig. 18.3a and derived a relationship between the de-
cay constant λ of the nucleus against α-particle decay and the energy of the α-particle
(Gamow, 1928; Gurney and Condon, 1928, 1929). This theory of α decay could account
naturally for the very narrow range of energies of the α-particle and the enormous range
of decay constants, as found by Hans Geiger and John Nuttall in 1911. The law can be
written
ln λ = −A Z
√
E
+ B ,
(18.4)
where λ = ln 2/(half-life), Z is the atomic number, E the total kinetic energy of the
α-particle and the residual nucleus, and A and B are constants (Geiger and Nuttall, 1911).
A modern version of the Geiger–Nuttall law is shown in Fig. 18.3b.
18.3 The splitting of the atom and the Cockcroft and
Walton experiment
During the last years of his tenure of the Chair of Physics at Manchester University,
Rutherford carried out a key experiment in which he bombarded nitrogen atoms with the
α-particles produced in the radioactive decays of radium-C (Fig. 18.4). The surprising

The aftermath
result was the detection of the emission of energetic particles, which, after a careful set
of further experiments, Rutherford concluded had to be protons liberated in collisions
between the α-particle and the nuclei of nitrogen atoms. As he wrote in the conclusion of his
paper,
‘From the results so far obtained it is difﬁcult to avoid the conclusion that the long-range
atoms arising from the collision of alpha particles with nitrogen are not nitrogen atoms
but probably atoms of hydrogen, or atoms of mass 2. If this be the case, we must conclude
that the nitrogen atom is disintegrated under the intense forces developed in a close
collision with a swift alpha particle, and that the hydrogen atom which is liberated formed
a constituent part of the nitrogen nucleus.’ (Rutherford, 1919)
We now understand that the origin of the fast protons was the nuclear interaction
14N + α →17 O + p .
(18.5)
Further experiments were undertaken by Rutherford and James Chadwick who found
similar fast protons when other atoms were bombarded by α-particles. A problem was that
the energies of the α-particles were limited to those available from naturally occurring
radioactive nuclides. Ideally, a more controlled beam of incident particles was required.
The problem was that, as can be seen from Fig. 18.3b, the energies of the particles would
have to be in the MeV energy range and it was a serious technological challenge to create
such electrostatic potentials in the laboratory.
Gamow realised that his theory of barrier penetration could account for the penetration
of α-particles into nitrogen nuclei in Rutherford’s experiments. He explained the theory
in a manuscript sent to Rutherford and his colleague John Cockcroft in December 1929.
Cockcroft repeated Gamow’s calculations and showed that, because of the process of barrier
penetration, protons accelerated to only 300 keV could penetrate a boron nucleus with about
0.6% probability. Cockcroft inferred that an accelerating electric potential of only 300 keV
would be sufﬁcient to penetrate the boron nucleus and induce nuclear transmutations.
By 1932, after a great deal of effort, Cockcroft and Ernest Walton had developed the
technology of electrostatic particle acceleration to the extent that potentials of 700 keV
could be sustained to accelerate protons to these energies (Fig. 18.5). They succeeded in
inducing the ﬁrst artiﬁcial nuclear disintegrations by bombarding lithium nuclei with high
energy protons (Cockcroft and Walton, 1932). The process involved was
7 Li + p →4He + 4He .
(18.6)
The energies of the accelerated protons were precisely known, as were the rest masses
of the lithium and helium atoms. The kinetic energies of the helium nuclei ejected in
the interaction (18.6) could be measured. As a result, this nuclear interaction provided
the ﬁrst direct experimental test of Einstein’s mass–energy relation E = mec2 – precise
agreement was found with Einstein’s prediction. This experiment marked the beginning
of experimental high energy physics in which particles are accelerated to high energies
and used as probes of the structure of the nucleus and as tools for the discovery of new
particles.3

18.4 Discovery of the neutron
Rutherford’s Bakerian lecture to the Royal Society of London in 1920 provides a vivid
picture of the state of knowledge of the properties of the atomic nucleus at that time
(Rutherford, 1920). Atomic nuclei have masses about two or more times that which can
be attributed to positively charged protons. The commonly held explanation was that the
nucleus was composed of electrons and protons, the ‘inner’ electrons neutralising the extra
protons. The fact that certain nuclei ejected electrons in radioactive β decays supported
this point of view. Rutherford speculated in his review that the neutral mass in the nucleus
might be in the form of some new type of particle, similar to the proton but with no electric
charge. As he wrote,
‘. . . it may be possible for an electron to combine much more closely with the H-nucleus
[than is the case in the ordinary hydrogen atom] . . . It is the intention of the writer to test
[this idea] . . . The existence of such atoms seems almost necessary to explain the building
up of the heavy elements.’ (Rutherford, 1920)
During the 1920s Rutherford and his colleagues, particularly James Chadwick, made a
number of unsuccessful attempts to ﬁnd evidence for these particles, which became known
as neutrons. Little attention was paid to Rutherford’s proposal.

The aftermath
Fig. 18.6
The apparatus with which Chadwick discovered the neutron (Chadwick, 1932).
In 1930, Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker discovered that very penetrating radiation was
emitted when light elements such as beryllium were bombarded by α-particles (Bothe and
Becker, 1930). Because the penetrating particles did not cause ionisation, they postulated
that the neutral particles were high energy γ -rays. In 1932, Ir`ene Joliot-Curie and her
husband Fr´ed´eric Joliot in France carried out a similar series of experiments in which the
penetrating neutral radiation hit a block of parafﬁn wax, which was found to emit energetic
protons. If the energetic protons were produced by Compton scattering, the γ -rays would
have had to be of very high energy, ∼50 MeV (Curie and Joliot, 1932). Chadwick guessed
that the penetrating radiation was rather a ﬂux of the elusive neutrons. Within a matter of
weeks, he performed the key experiment in which α-particles bombarded a beryllium target,
releasing neutrons which then collided with a block of parafﬁn wax (Fig. 18.6). Energetic
protons were emitted in collisions between the neutrons and the protons in the parafﬁn wax
which were detected in an ionisation chamber, enabling the mass of the invisible neutron
to be estimated. It was inferred that the neutral particles had masses roughly the same as
that of the proton (Chadwick, 1932). He interpreted the nuclear interaction as the following
process,
α + 9Be →12C + n .
(18.7)
This was the discovery of the neutron.
18.5 Discovery of nuclear fission
The discovery of the neutron had immediate implications for experimental nuclear physics.
Unlike the electron or the α-particle, the neutron is electrically neutral and so could penetrate
the Coulomb barrier of the nucleus. The discipline of nuclear physics was transformed since
heavy nuclei such as uranium could be bombarded with neutrons, resulting in the formation
of new isotopes. Such experiments were initiated by Fermi and his colleagues in Rome

18.6 Fermi’s theory of weak interactions
in 1934. They believed that they had demonstrated the formation of a new element with
atomic number 94 (Fermi et al., 1934), but the result was viewed with some scepticism.
The experiments were repeated by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann. In
1938, following the Anschluss in which she lost her citizenship, Meitner ﬂed to Sweden
and continued her collaboration with Hahn by mail. During this correspondence, Hahn
informed Meitner of his discovery of traces of barium when uranium was bombarded with
neutrons. This came as a complete surprise since barium has only 40% the atomic weight
of uranium. Meitner soon convinced herself and Hahn that the barium resulted from what
became known as the nuclear ﬁssion of the uranium nuclei. The results were published by
Hahn and Strassmann (1939). Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch, who was also working
in Sweden, published the results of their calculations that a new type of nuclear reaction
had been observed in Hahn and Strassmann’s experiments (Meitner and Frisch, 1939).
Leo Szilard was well aware of the signiﬁcance of these experiments for nuclear energy
generation. In 1933, following Chadwick’s discovery of the neutron, Szilard had realised
that a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction would be possible if the neutrons liberated in
the types of interaction involved in the Cockcroft and Walton experiment could be used
to initiate further nuclear interactions. He ﬁled patents for this concept and also carried
out unsuccessful experiments in which light elements were bombarded with neutrons to
demonstrate the effect. As soon as the results of Hahn and Strassmann’s experiments were
published, he immediately realised that this provided a route to a nuclear chain reaction,
both for the generation of nuclear power and for the creation of nuclear weapons. He urged
restraint in the publication of these results because of the impending war, but Joliot and his
colleagues in Paris did not hesitate. The theory of nuclear chain reactions was published
by both groups in 1939 (von Halban et al., 1939; Szilard and Zinn, 1939). The details of
this story and the subsequent development of nuclear weapons is vividly told in Rhodes’
classic book The Making of the Atomic Bomb (1986).
18.6 Pauli, the neutrino and Fermi’s theory of weak interactions
Unlike the process of α decay in which the decay of a radioactive nuclide results in a well-
deﬁned energy for the emitted α-particle, the β decay process results in a broad spectrum
of electron energies. An example of the continuous energy spectrum of electrons found
in the decay of radium-E (210Bi) is shown in Fig. 18.7 (Neary, 1940). There is an upper
limit to the energies of the emitted electrons of just over 1 MeV, but the spread of energies
extends to less than 4% of this value, the maximum occurring at just less than 300 keV and
the average energy amounting to 390 keV. During the 1920s, there was an ongoing debate
about whether or not the broad continuum electron energy spectrum could be attributed to
what was termed ‘ordinary’ processes, meaning that the electrons were created with a single
energy which was then redistributed by ‘ordinary’ processes such a Compton scattering.
After two years of challenging experiments, Charles Ellis and William Alfred Wooster
completed calorimetric experiments in which they showed that the average energy deposited
in their calorimeter was about 350 keV per disintegration, rather than about 1 MeV as

might be expected if all the energy was injected with maximum energy of 1MeV and then
dissipated by ‘ordinary’ processes (Ellis and Wooster, 1927). The experiment indicated that
the measured electron energy spectrum was indeed the intrinsic energy spectrum of the
β-decay process. The problem was that the process seemed to violate conservation of energy.
Furthermore, with the understanding of the quantum mechanical rules for the addition of
angular momentum, the hyperﬁne splitting of atomic lines could be used to determine the
magnetic moments and hence the spin of nuclei. The process of β decay seemed to involve
a violation of the law of conservation of angular momentum at the nuclear level. Thus, the
conservation of both energy and angular momentum were in jeopardy.
For some time, Bohr returned to his old concern about the validity of the law of con-
servation of energy at the atomic level. In 1930, in desperation, Pauli suggested that the
problem might be solved by invoking the existence of a neutral particle which he called a
‘neutron’. Note that at this date, the only known ‘subatomic particles’ were the proton, the
electron and the photon. Pauli’s radical proposal was contained in an impassioned letter to
his expert colleagues working on radioactivity at their meeting in T¨ubingen.4
‘Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have come to a desperate way out regarding the “wrong” statistics of the N- and
6Li nuclei, as well as the continuous β-spectrum, in order save the “alternation law” of
statistics and the energy law. To wit, the possibility that there could exist in the nucleus
electrically neutral particles, which I will call neutrons, which have spin 1/2 and satisfy
the exclusion principle and which are further distinct from light-quanta in that they do
not move with light velocity. The mass of the neutrons should be of the same order of
magnitude as the electron mass and in any case not larger than 0.01 times the proton
mass. . . . The continuous β-spectrum would then become understandable from the as-
sumption that in β-decay a neutron is emitted along with the electron in such a way that
the sum of the energies of the neutron and the electron is constant. . . .

18.7 Cosmic rays and the discovery of elementary particles
For the time being I dare not publish anything about this idea and address myself
conﬁdentially to you, dear radioactive ones, with the question how it would be with the
experimental proof of such a neutron, if it were to have a penetrating power equal to or
about ten times larger than a γ -ray.
I admit that my way out may not seem very probable a priori since one would probably
have seen the neutrons a long time ago if they exist. But only who dares wins and the
seriousness of the situation concerning the continuous β-spectrum, is illuminated by my
honoured predecessor, Mr. Debye, who recently said to me in Brussels: “Oh, it is best not
to think about this at all, as with new taxes”. One must therefore discuss seriously every
road to salvation. Thus, dear radioactive ones, examine and judge.
Unfortunately, I cannot appear personally in T¨ubingen since a ball which takes
place in Z¨urich the night of sixth to seventh of December makes my presence here
indispensable. . . .
Your most humble servant,
W. Pauli’
In 1932, Chadwick’s discovery of the neutron, meaning the neutral partner of the proton,
changed the picture. In the following year, Fermi suggested that Pauli’s ‘neutron’ might be
better called a neutrino and that usage was established from then on. In the following year,
Fermi published his theory of weak interactions and β decay (Fermi, 1934). In his famous
paper, he treated the process by analogy with the process of the emission of radiation
according to the rapidly developing theory of quantum electrodynamics. Neutrinos have
a very small cross-section for interaction with matter and it was not until 1956 that they
were detected experimentally by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan who used a ﬁssion
reactor as a source of neutrinos (Reines and Cowan, 1956). The discovery was made only
two and a half years before Pauli’s death. His response on receiving the news was sent in a
congratulatory telegram:
‘Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli.’
18.7 Cosmic rays and the discovery of elementary particles
From the 1930s until the early 1950s, the cosmic radiation provided a natural source of
very high energy particles which were energetic enough to penetrate the nucleus. This was
the principal technique by which new particles were discovered until the early 1950s. As
already recounted in Sect. 16.7.2, in 1930 Millikan and Anderson used an electromagnet
10 times stronger than that used by Skobeltsyn to study the tracks of particles passing
through a cloud chamber. Anderson observed curved tracks identical to those of electrons
but corresponding to particles with positive electric charge (Anderson, 1932). The discovery
of the positron was conﬁrmed by Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini in 1933 using
an improved technique in which the cloud chamber was only triggered after it was certain
that a cosmic ray had passed through (Blackett and Occhialini, 1933). They obtained many

The aftermath
excellent photographs of the positive electrons, on many occasions showers containing
equal numbers of positive and negative electrons created by cosmic ray interactions.
There were more surprises in store, however. Anderson noted that there were often much
more penetrating positive and negative particle tracks in the cloud chamber pictures. These
particles displayed little evidence of interaction with the gas in the chamber. By 1936,
Anderson and Seth Neddermeyer were sufﬁciently conﬁdent of their results to announce
the discovery of particles with mass intermediate between that of the electron and the
proton (Anderson and Neddermeyer, 1936). These mesotrons had mass between about 50
and 400 times the mass of the electron. This discovery coincided rather conveniently with
the theoretical prediction by Hideki Yukawa concerning the nature of the strong force
which binds neutrons and protons together in the nucleus. According to Yukawa’s theory,
the strong short-range force could be understood in terms of the exchange of particles about
250 times as massive as the electron (Yukawa, 1935). In fact, the particles discovered by
Anderson and Neddermeyer, nowadays known as muons, are not the particles which bind
nuclei together. The identiﬁcation was somewhat unsatisfactory because the mesotrons
showed little interaction with nuclei in the chamber, whereas the exchange particle was
expected to show a strong interaction with nuclei.
The same procedures were used immediately after the Second World War by George
Rochester and Clifford Butler who constructed a new cloud chamber to use with a large
electromagnet obtained by Blackett before the War. In 1947 they reported the discovery
of two cases of particle tracks in the form of ‘V’s with apparently no incoming particle
(Rochester and Bulter, 1947). They correctly suggested that the Vs resulted from the
spontaneous decay of an unknown particle, the mass of which could be estimated from the
decay products. Both had mass about half that of the proton. To obtain higher ﬂuxes of
cosmic radiation, the experiments were repeated at much higher altitudes. Two years later,
the experiments were carried out by Blackett’s group working at the Pic du Midi Observatory
in the Pyrenees and by Anderson and Cowan on White Mountain in California. Many more
examples of Vs were found and this class of particle became known as strange particles.
Both neutral and charged strange particles were discovered. Most of them had mass about
half that of the proton and are what are now referred to as charged and neutral kaons (K+,
K−, K0). There were a few examples, however, of neutral particles with mass greater than
the mass of the proton – these are now known as lambda particles (). What puzzled the
physicists was their long lifetimes – 10−8 and 10−10 s, which is many orders of magnitude
greater than the time-scale associated with the strong interactions.
Meanwhile another powerful tool for the study of particle collisions and interactions had
been developed by Cecil Powell at Bristol University. Photographic plates had played a
key role in the discovery of X-rays and radioactivity in the 1890s. Powell, in collaboration
with the Ilford company, developed special ‘nuclear’ emulsions which were sufﬁciently
sensitive to register the tracks of protons, electrons and all the other types of charged
particle which had been discovered. Powell and his colleagues mastered the techniques of
producing thick layers of emulsion by stacking layer upon layer of emulsion, resulting in a
three-dimensional picture of the interactions taking place in the emulsion. Among the ﬁrst
discoveries using this high precision technique was that of the pion (π) in 1947, which was
the particle predicted by Yukawa in 1936 (Lattes et al., 1947).

18.8 Astrophysical applications
By 1953, accelerator technology had developed to the point where energies comparable
to those available in the cosmic rays could be produced in the laboratory with known
energies and directed precisely onto the chosen target. After about 1953, the future of high
energy physics lay in the accelerator laboratory rather than in the use of cosmic rays.
18.8 Astrophysical applications5
The solution of the problem of energy generation in the Sun was one of the ﬁrst fruits
of the discovery of quantum mechanics. In his early papers Eddington had advocated the
annihilation of matter as an inexhaustible source of energy for the stars but in 1920 he
realised that, although there was no known mechanism by which nuclear energy could
be released, at least energetically this provided an attractive means of powering the stars.
In a remarkably prescient paragraph of his Presidential Address to the Mathematical and
Physics Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its Annual
Meeting, held in Cardiff, he stated (Eddington, 1920):
‘Certain physical investigations in the past year . . . make it probable to my mind that
some portion of this sub-atomic energy is actually being set free in the stars. F. W. Aston’s
experiments seem to leave no room for doubt that all the elements are constituted out
of hydrogen atoms bound together with negative electrons. The nucleus of the helium
atom, for example, consists of 4 hydrogen atoms bound with two electrons. But Aston has
further shown conclusively that the mass of the helium atom is less than the sum of the
masses of the 4 hydrogen atoms which enter into it; and in this at any rate the chemists
agree with him. There is a loss of mass in the synthesis amounting to about 1 part in 120,
the atomic weight of hydrogen being 1.008 and that of helium 4. . . . Now mass cannot be
annihilated, and the deﬁcit can only represent the mass of the electrical energy set free
in the transmutation. We can therefore at once calculate the quantity of energy liberated
when helium is made out of hydrogen. If 5 per cent of the star’s mass consists initially of
hydrogen atoms, which are gradually being combined to form more complex elements,
the total heat liberated will more than sufﬁce for our demands, and we need look no
further for the source of a star’s energy.’
Eddington had the good fortune to be working at the Observatories at Cambridge University,
only a twenty minute walk from the Cavendish Laboratory where Francis Aston was carrying
out his precise measurements of atomic and isotopic masses. At that time, nuclear energy
generation could be no more than a hypothesis, but Eddington had indeed hit upon the
correct solution for the energy source of the Sun. The beauty of Eddington’s argument was
that it did not depend upon the precise nature of the nucleus, but only upon the conservation
of energy and the mass–energy relation E = mc2.
The problem was that, even at the high temperatures of stellar interiors, the Coulomb
repulsion between protons and nuclei is so great that, according to classical physics, protons
could not penetrate the nucleus and so this energy source could not be tapped. The solution
of this problem had to await the theory of quantum mechanical tunnelling (Gamow, 1928;
Gurney and Condon, 1928). One year later, Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans applied

The aftermath
Gamow’s theory to the physics of nuclear reactions in the hot central regions of stars
(Atkinson and Houtermans, 1929). By considering the process of barrier penetration by
a Maxwellian distribution of protons, they established two key features of the process
of nuclear energy generation in stars. First, the most effective energy sources involve
interactions with nuclei of small electric charge since the Coulomb barriers are lower
than for nuclei with large charges. Second, the particles which can penetrate the Coulomb
barriers are those few particles in the high energy tail of the Maxwellian distribution. As
a result, nuclear reactions can take place at temperatures which are considerably lower
than might have been expected. These ideas also suggested why the luminosity of the stars
should be a sensitive function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the rate of
barrier penetration increases exponentially and so hotter, more massive stars should be
more luminous than less massive stars.
Atkinson’s objective was to account for the origin of the chemical elements by the
successive addition of protons to nuclei. He argued that the process of forming helium by
the combination of four protons was very unlikely and proposed instead that helium could
be formed by the successive addition of protons to heavier nuclei which, when they became
too massive for nuclear stability, would eject α-particles and so create helium (Atkinson,
1931a,b). This proposal was the precursor of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle,
which was discovered independently by Carl von Weizs¨acker and Hans Bethe in 1938
(Weizs¨acker, 1937, 1938; Bethe, 1939). In this cycle, carbon acts as a catalyst for the
formation of helium through the successive addition of protons accompanied by two β+
decays as follows:
12C + p →13N + γ ; 13N →13C + e+ + νe ; 13C + p →14N + γ
14N + p →15O + γ ; 15O →15N + e+ + νe ; 15N + p →4He + 12C.
In the meantime, it had become possible to make estimates of the reaction rates for the
simplest nuclear reaction, the combination of pairs of protons to form deuterium nuclei
which can then combine with other deuterons to form 3He and 4He. The ﬁrst calculations
were carried out by Atkinson in 1936 (Atkinson, 1936) and were much reﬁned in 1938 by
Bethe and Critchﬁeld who combined Fermi’s theory of weak interactions with Gamow’s
theory of barrier penetration (Bethe and Critchﬁeld, 1938). The principal series of reactions
in the proton-proton (or p-p) chain are as follows:
p + p →2H + e+ + νe
2H + p →3He + γ
3He + 3He →4He + 2p.
The crucial ﬁrst reaction in the chain involves a weak interaction in which a positron and
neutrino are released in what may be thought of as the transformation of one of the protons
into a neutron. This reaction accounts for most of the energy release in the p-p chain but
it has never been measured experimentally at the energies of interest for nucleosynthesis
in the Sun. Bethe and Critchﬁeld showed that this series of reactions could account for
the luminosity of the Sun. In addition, they found that the rate of energy production ε of
the p-p chain depends upon the central temperature of the star as ε ∝T 4. In 1939, Bethe
worked out the corresponding energy production rate for the CNO cycle and found a very

much stronger dependence, ε ∝T 17 (Bethe, 1939). He concluded that the CNO cycle was
dominant in massive stars while the p-p chain was the principal energy source for stars with
mass less than roughly the mass of the Sun, M⊙.
The theory of white dwarfs was one of the ﬁrst triumphs of the new quantum theory of
statistical mechanics as applied to astrophysics. In 1926, Ralph Fowler used Fermi–Dirac
statistics to derive the equation of state of a cold degenerate electron gas (Fowler, 1926)
and found the important result
p = (3π2)2/3

ρ
μemu

,
(18.8)
where μe is the mean molecular weight of the material of the star per electron and mu is
the uniﬁed atomic mass constant. The important aspect of this equation of state is that it
is independent of temperature and so the structure of white dwarfs can be derived directly
from the Lane–Emden equation of stellar structure.6 Unlike main sequence stars, in which
pressure support is provided by the thermal pressure of hot gas, the white dwarfs are
supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The source of their luminosity is the internal
thermal energy with which they were endowed on formation. According to Fowler’s picture,
the white dwarfs simply radiate away their internal thermal energies and end up as inert
cold stars with all the nuclei and electrons in their ground states.
In 1929, Wilhelm Anderson showed that the degenerate electrons in the centres of white
dwarfs with mass roughly that of the Sun become relativistic (Anderson, 1929). In the
extreme relativistic limit, the equation of state of the degenerate electron gas becomes
p = (3π2)1/3¯hc

(18.9)
Once again, the result is independent of temperature but the change in the dependence of
pressure upon density from p ∝ρ5/3 to p ∝ρ4/3 has profound implications. Anderson
and Edmund Stoner realised that the consequence was that there do not exist equilibrium
conﬁgurations for degenerate stars with mass greater than about the mass of the Sun
(Anderson, 1929; Stoner, 1929). The most famous analysis of this result was carried out by
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who had begun working on this problem before he arrived
to take up a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1930. He found the crucial result
that, in the extreme relativistic limit, there is an upper limit to the mass of stable white
dwarfs,

(18.10)
This mass is known as the Chandrasekhar mass (Chandrasekhar, 1931). The critical mass
depends upon the chemical composition of the material of the star through the value
of μe, the mean molecular weight of the stellar material per electron. Other than that,
the Chandrasekhar mass only depends upon fundamental constants. Since μe ≈2 for the
material of compact stars, the Chandrasekhar mass is usually quoted as MCh = 1.46M⊙.
The cause of the instability is that, in the extreme relativistic limit, both the internal
thermal energy Uth and the gravitational potential energy Ugrav of the star depend upon the

The aftermath
radius in the same way, Uth = (1/2)Ugrav ∝R−1. Now, the gravitational potential energy
is proportional to M2 whereas the thermal energy is proportional to the mass of the star
and so, for massive enough stars, the gravitational energy term dominates causing collapse,
which cannot be stabilised by the pressure of the degenerate gas since the two energies
always depend upon the radius in the same way. The inference is that there is nothing to
prevent degenerate stars more massive than MCh from collapsing to very high densities
indeed and possibly to a state of complete gravitational collapse.
Quite independently in 1932, Lev Landau had come to the conclusion that gravitational
collapse to a singularity should be taken seriously (Landau, 1932) and in 1938 Robert
Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder gave the ﬁrst general relativistic analysis of what would
be observed in the ﬁnal stages of the gravitational collapse of a pressureless sphere (Op-
penheimer and Snyder, 1939). In their paper, they described the key observed features of
what are now termed black holes.
Following Chadwick’s discovery of the neutron in 1932 (Chadwick, 1932), the ﬁrst
mention of the possibility of neutron stars appears as the famous ‘Additional Remark’ to
a paper by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky of 1934 (Baade and Zwicky, 1934b). In that
year, they published two papers on the energetics of what they termed ‘super-novae’. In
their ﬁrst paper, Baade and Zwicky proposed that the population of novae consists of two
types, the ordinary novae, which are relatively common phenomena and which had been
used by Lundmark as distance indicators for spiral nebulae, and the super-novae which
are very rare but very energetic indeed (Baade and Zwicky, 1934a). In their second paper,
they suggested that such events might be the sources of the cosmic rays, discovered by
Victor Hess in 1912 (Hess, 1913). Both proposals are remarkably close to the truth. As an
addendum to the second paper (Baade and Zwicky, 1934b), they wrote
‘With all reserve we advance the view that a super-nova represents the transition of an
ordinary star into a neutron star, consisting mainly of neutrons. Such a star may possess
a very small radius and an extremely high density. As neutrons can be packed much
more closely than ordinary nuclei and electrons, the “gravitational packing” energy in
a cold neutron star may become very large, and under certain circumstances, may far
exceed the ordinary nuclear packing fractions. A neutron star would therefore represent
the most stable conﬁguration of matter as such. The consequences of this hypothesis will
be developed in another place, where also will be mentioned some observations that tend
to support the idea of stellar bodies made up mainly of neutrons.’
It is best to allow Zwicky to describe how these ideas were received in a quotation from the
extraordinary preface to his Catalogue of Selected Compact Galaxies and of Post-Eruptive
Galaxies of 1968 (Zwicky, 1968).
‘In the Los Angeles Times of January 19, 1934, there appeared an insert in one of the
comic strips, entitled “Be Scientiﬁc with Ol’Doc Dabble” quoting me as having stated
“Cosmic rays are caused by exploding stars which burn with a ﬁre equal to 100 million
suns and then shrivel from 1
2 million miles diameter to little spheres 14 miles thick”, Says
Prof. Fritz Zwicky, Swiss Physicist. This, in all modesty, I claim to be one of the most
concise triple predictions ever made in science. More than 30 years were to pass before
this statement was proved to be true in every respect.’

18.8 Astrophysical applications
In the meantime, Gamow showed in 1937 that a gas of neutrons could be compressed
to a much higher density than a gas of nuclei and electrons and estimated the probable
densities of such a star to be about 1017 kg m−3 (Gamow, 1937, 1939). The issue of the
maximum mass of neutron stars was discussed by Landau in 1938 (Landau, 1938) and in
much greater detail by Oppenheimer, Robert Serber and George Volkoff (Oppenheimer and
Serber, 1938; Oppenheimer and Volkoff, 1939). The physics is the same as in the case of the
white dwarfs but now neutron degeneracy pressure holds up the star. Complications arise
because it is necessary to take into account the details of the equation of state of neutron
matter at nuclear densities and the effects of general relativity can no longer be neglected.
They found an upper mass limit of about 0.7 M⊙. This result is not so different from the
best modern estimates which correspond to about 2–3 M⊙.
This work created some theoretical interest but little enthusiasm from the observers. The
radii of typical neutron stars were expected to be about 10 km and so there was no prospect
of detecting signiﬁcant ﬂuxes of thermal radiation from such tiny stars. The idea of Baade
and Zwicky that a neutron star might be the remnant left behind after a supernova explosion
was proved correct 33 years later with the discovery of pulsars by Antony Hewish, Jocelyn
Bell(-Burnell) and their colleagues in 1987 (Hewish et al., 1968).

Epilogue
As expected when I started out on this project, this has proved to be a complex and,
at times, difﬁcult story. After all, what was involved was tearing up the foundations of
classical physics, which had been extraordinarily successful in explaining the macroscopic
world about us, and replacing it by something radically different and non-intuitive in terms
of our everyday experience. But the effort involved has been more than repaid by the very
much deeper appreciation I have gained of the extraordinary works of the pioneers of
quantum mechanics, both the theorists and the experimenters. If the brilliant theoretical
researches of Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, Schr¨odinger, Pauli, Dirac
and many others form the central core of this story, it should be remembered that their
researches were inspired by the equally brilliant achievements of experimental physics.
Another huge bonus has been a deepened understanding of quantum mechanics itself – if
only I had these insights more than 50 years ago when I ﬁrst encountered the subject.
There is a great deal more that could be said. I must reiterate that I have presented a
somewhat streamlined version of the story in order to ensure that there is some continuous
pathway, however tortuous, to the way in which the new understandings came about. For a
full appreciation of the complexity of the story and the numerous blind alleys and diversions
which took place, there is no substitute for in-depth absorption in Mehra and Rechenberg’s
magisterial exposition of the history of quantum theory. Likewise, Jammer’s wonderful
survey of the conceptual and philosophical development of the subject is indispensable.
I make no claim even to begin to approach the depth and thoroughness of these exposi-
tions. Building on these authors’ achievements, my much more modest aim has been to
demonstrate at an accessible level exactly what the great pioneers actually did and to enable
readers to reconstruct for themselves the extraordinary efforts of the imagination involved
in coming to these new understandings. In Chandrasekhar’s words, the appreciation of the
subject cannot be achieved with ‘modest effort’.
The story has an immediacy which corresponds exactly with my own experience as a re-
search scientist. It reveals how experimental and theoretical physicists go about discovering
new laws of nature and the way in which these then shape our world. I have concentrated
upon the intellectual, theoretical and experimental side of the story, but there is an equally
absorbing human story which is the subject of the numerous excellent biographies of the
protagonists of this story. My admiration for all the founders of quantum mechanics has
increased enormously through the detailed study of their original works. I personally ﬁnd
it a dramatic and awe-inspiring adventure which changed forever our understanding of the
nature of the physical world we live in.

Notes
Chapter 1
1. Pippard’s review provides an illuminating account of the profession of the experimental and
theoretical physicist in 1900 (Pippard, 1995). Equally important are the statistics in the essay by
Heilbron (1977) concerning the central role of European physicists, particularly those in Germany,
at the turn of the century.
2. Many more details of these issues and problems are contained in the various case studies described
in the second edition of my book Theoretical Concepts in Physics (TCP2) (Longair, 2003). The
various topics will only be summarised here with references to the relevant sections of TCP2.
3. I have enjoyed revisiting my old undergraduate chemistry textbook General and Inorganic Chem-
istry by P. J. Durrant (1952). I have used the formulation of the laws as expressed by Durrant.
4. In the modern SI system, the carbon-12 atom is used as the standard for atomic weights. One mole
is deﬁned as the mass of a substance which contains the same number of chemical units (atoms or
molecules) as exactly 12 grams of carbon-12. For example, since the molecular weight of oxygen
is 31.9988, one mole of oxygen has mass 31.9988 gram.
5. See TCP2, pp. 257–263. The outline of Maxwell’s derivation is as follows. The total number of
molecules is N and the x, y and z components of their velocities are vx, vy and vz. Maxwell
supposed that the velocity distribution in the three orthogonal directions must be the same after a
great number of collisions, that is,
N f (vx) dvx = N f (vy) dvy = N f (vz) dvz,
where f is the same function. The three perpendicular components of the velocity are entirely
independent and hence the number of molecules with velocities in the range vx to vx + dvx, vy to
vy + dvy and vz to vz + dvz is
N f (vx) f (vy) f (vz) dvx dvy dvz
But, the total velocity of any molecule v is v2 = v2
x + v2
y + v2
z . Because large numbers of collisions
have taken place, the probability distribution for the total velocity v, φ(v), must be isotropic and
depend only on v, that is,
f (vx) f (vy) f (vz) = φ(v) = φ[(v2
x + v2
y + v2
z )1/2] .
(1)
where we have normalised the function φ(v) so that
 ∞
−∞
 ∞

φ(v) dvx dvy dvz = 1.
Equation (1) is a functional equation. By inspection, a suitable solution is
f (vx) = C eAv2x ,
f (vy) = C eAv2y,
f (vz) = C eAv2z .
where C and A are constants. The distribution must converge as v →∞and hence A must be
negative. After normalisation (1.1) is obtained.

papers of 1861 and 1865, the equations were written out in a somewhat lengthier form than
(1.5)–(1.8) and involved seven equations. Maxwell’s equations were reorganised into their more
familiar form by Heaviside, Helmholtz and Hertz in the subsequent years.

Voigt set the constant κ = γ −1. Much later, long after the papers by Lorentz and Einstein, Lorentz,

the Lorentz transforms in 1887. Not only is the equation scale invariant, it is also conformally
invariant.

of experimental physics and its discoveries through the whole period covered by this book.

whatever the properties of the walls of the enclosure as a result of the principle of detailed
balance.

4. The argument also works for perfectly absorbing walls since, according to Kirchhoff’s theorem, a
perfect absorber is also a perfect emitter of radiation. Planck uses the case of perfectly reﬂecting
walls so that the argument is purely electrodynamic.
5. Notice that this intensity is the total power per unit area from 4π steradians. The usual deﬁnition
of intensity is in terms of W m−2 Hz−1 sr−1. Correspondingly, in (2.19), the relation between

within the enclosure to consist of particles travelling in random directions at the speed of light.

unit time is 1

of TCP2 (Longair, 2003).
Chapter 5
1. Different authors user different notation for the quantum numbers. For consistency, I will endeavour
to use a consistent notation throughout, but it will be different from those appearing in the primary
literature. As we will ﬁnd, the quantum numbers have slightly different meanings in the ﬁnal
version of quantum mechanics and so using nφ, nr and nθ in the old quantum theory should not
cause problems and should clarify the differences between the old and new theories.
2. I have preserved the italic and bold fonts of the original text.

and

and

5. This follows the notation of Goldstein (1950) who uses S in the time-dependent version of the
Hamilton–Jacobi equations and W in the time-independent version. W is referred to as Hamilton’s
characteristic function.
6. In the quantum mechanics of Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger, the principal quantum number is
denoted by n, rather than (nr + nθ + m). As will become apparent, the signiﬁcance of n in
deﬁning the stationary states in the ﬁnal theory of quantum mechanics is different from that in the
Bohr–Sommerfeld picture. The other quantum numbers have corresponding equivalences which
will be described in due course.

3. Note that, in Bohr’s usage, ω is the frequency of orbital motion, not the angular frequency. This
usage is adopted in (6.25) and (6.26).
4. Note that the quantum defects in (1.18) and (1.19)–(1.21) are written with a plus sign. The
difference between these and (6.63) is explained by adopting different initial values for the
principal quantum number n.

an enemy alien in Munich, during which period of internment, he carried out these pioneering
calculations.
2. Schwarzschild’s paper was published on the day he died, 11 May 1916, from the illness pemphigus
contracted while he was on military service on the eastern front in Russia.

Chapter 8
1. Details of Niels Bohr’s life and times are contained in the books Niels Bohr: A Centenary Volume
edited by A. P. French and P. S. Kennedy (1985) and Niels Bohr’s Times, in Physics, Philosophy
and Polity by A. Pais (1991)
2. See Mehra and Rechenberg (1982a), 1, 230.
3. The Wolfskehl Prize was awarded to Andrew Wiles on 28 June 1997 almost a century after
Wolfskehl’s death. Wiles completed his proof in 1995 but it took a further two years of expert
analysis to conﬁrm that the theorem had at last been proved.
4. A priority dispute ensued between the French and Danish physicists about the discovery of hafnium.
This caused Bohr considerable distress (see, for example, the discussion by Kragh (1985)).
5. The history of X-ray spectroscopy is presented in the book Fifty Years of X-ray Diffraction (ed.
P. P. Ewald) (1962). This book is available on-line in pdf form from the International Union of
Crystallography at http://www.iucr.org/publ/50yearsofxraydiffraction.
6. Van der Waerden has made a careful study of why Pauli did not press ahead and propose the
spin and magnetic moment of the electron when he was so very close to their discovery (van der
Waerden, 1960).
7. More details of this episode and its context are given in Sect. 16.1.
Chapter 9
1. See Mehra and Rechenberg (1982a), p. 511.
2. These results are derived in Chapter 9 of my book High Energy Astrophysics (Longair, 2011).
3. The differences were to ﬁnd an explanation in quantum mechanics and are associated with the
symmetries of the wavefunctions for particles of different spins (see Chap. 16 and Sect. 18.1).
4. An excellent concise treatment of the derivation of the Bose–Einstein distribution is given by
Huang in his book Introduction to Statistical Physics (Huang, 2001).
5. In terms of quantum mechanics, the explanation for this distinction is neatly summarised by Huang
who remarks: ‘The classical way of counting in effect accepts all wave functions regardless of their
symmetry properties under the interchange of coordinates. The set of acceptable wave functions is
far greater than the union of the two quantum cases [the Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein cases].’
6. In his paper, de Broglie uses the principle of least action in the form of Maupertuis’ principle
which can be applied in the case of a particle moving in a stationary potential (de Broglie, 1924b).
This is discussed in more detail in Sect. 14.5.1.
7. For a demonstration of this result, see Theoretical Concepts in Physics, Sect. 7.3 (Longair, 2003).
Chapter 10
1. The term ‘quantum mechanics’ ﬁrst appeared in the paper by Born (1924) which is discussed later
in this chapter. Jammer (1989) discusses the origin of this term and its signiﬁcance.
2. See, for example, Sect. 5.3.2 of Theoretical Concepts in Physics (Longair, 2003).
3. This result is demonstrated in, for example, Sect. 6.11 of Theoretical Concepts in Physics (Longair,
2003).
4. Mehra and Rechenberg (1982a) provide a detailed account of the history of appointments to
the chairs of mathematics and physics at G¨ottingen (see pp. 262–313). Their discussion tracks
the various routes through the academic profession from doctoral student, to Habilitation, to
Privatdozent, to extraordinary professor and ﬁnally to the most prestigious position as ordinary
professor. Because of a prohibition on appointing professorships by internal promotion from
Privatdozent, the winning of a professorship normally meant moving from one University to
another. This accounts for the somewhat complex movements of physicists and mathematicians
as they made their way up through the university profession.

Chapter 11
1. Fermi’s problems with Heisenberg’s paper are described by van der Waerden (1967). Weinberg’s
concerns are expressed in his book Dreams of a Final Theory (Weinberg, 1992). He writes
‘If the reader is mystiﬁed at what Heisenberg was doing, he or she is not alone. I have tried several times
to read the paper that Heisenberg wrote on returning from Heligoland, and, although I think I understand
quantum mechanics, I have never understood Heisenberg’s motivation for the mathematical steps in
his paper. Theoretical physicists in their most successful work tend to play one of two roles: they are
either sages or magicians . . . It is usually not difﬁcult to understand the papers of the sage-physicists,
but the papers of the magician-physicists are often incomprehensible. In that sense, Heisenberg’s 1925
paper was pure magic.’
2. The issues of the notation used by Heisenberg are discussed by van der Waerden (1967) who
shows how they are related to the notation used in the paper by Kramers and Heisenberg (1925)
and to his correspondence with Kronig and Pauli.
3. We obtain exact agreement if we set |x0| = |x0|/2 (see Mehra and Rechenberg (1982b), p. 301).
The justiﬁcation for this step is given in Sect. 11.5, equation (11.70).
4. As pointed out by Aitchison et al. (2004), Heisenberg confusingly uses the terminology a(n, n −τ)
in both (11.40) and (11.70) without explaining why the factor of 4 disappears from the latter
expression.
5. The expression (11.104) is identical to the result found in the quantum theory of rotation, the n
being replaced by the angular momentum quantum number j. Therefore,
W =
h2
8π 2I

j( j + 1) + 1

Chapter 12
1. I enjoyed revisiting the elementary text book by A.C. Aitken Determinants and Matrices (1959)
from which I learned matrix algebra.
2. The term libration means periodic perturbations to the elliptical orbits of planets in celestial
mechanics and of electrons according to the old quantum theory.
3. I have given an elementary proof of this relation in Appendix A4 of my text Theoretical Concepts
in Physics (Longair, 2003).
4. In Sect. IV.5 of Volume 3 of their series, The Historical Development of Quantum Theory. The
Formulation of Matrix Mechanics and its Modiﬁcations 1925–1926, Mehra and Rechenberg
(1982c) provide a clear summary of the contents of Pauli’s important paper.
Chapter 13
1. Poisson’s theorem is the statement that, for arbitrary functions F1, F2 and F3,
[[F1, F2], F3] + [[F2, F3], F1] + [[F3, F1], F2] = 0 ,
(9)
where the square brackets represent Poisson brackets.
2. I use the convention that Poisson brackets are contained within square brackets. In the literature,
they are often enclosed in round brackets.
3. In Dirac’s paper, he uses h to mean what we would now call ¯h = h/2π. Likewise, when he uses the
word frequency, he means what we would call angular frequency ω. I have made these translations
in the usage employed throughout this book and also converted to SI units.

4. Pauli’s paper was received by Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik on 17 January 1926 and published on
27 March 1926. Dirac’s paper was received by Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Soci-
ety on 22 January 1926 and published on 1 March 1926.

1. These papers and others were published in English in the bookCollected Papers on Wave Mechanics
(Schr¨odinger, 1928).
2. The origin of the Bose–Einstein condensation can be understood from the following arguments.
The Bose–Einstein distribution can be written
nk =
gk
eα+βεk −1 ,
(10)
where the constants α and β are to be determined. On thermodynamics grounds, β = 1/kT and
α is determined by ﬁxing the number of photons, atoms or molecules. For black-body radiation,
the number of photons is unconstrained and so α = 0. The number of photons is matched to the
total energy in the Planck distribution – all the properties of the radiation are determined by the
temperature T alone.
In the case of the atoms of a monatomic gas, as shown in Sect. 14.2, gk = 4πp2 dp and
E = p2/2m. Therefore, converting to a continuous energy distribution,
N(E) dE =
gk
(BeE/kT −1) = 4πV (2m3E)1/2
h3 (BeE/kT −1) dE ,
(11)
where B = eα. The constant B cannot be less than 1 or else the number density of particles could
be negative. Therefore, B ≥1, α ≥0. This expression can be rewritten as follows,
N(E) dE =
V

A plot of F(B) as a function of B is shown in Fig. 1. For large values of B, the function F(B)
tends to 1/B and the particle distribution to the Boltzmann distribution. The ﬁgure also shows
that F(B) tends to a ﬁnite limit as B →1. For B = 1, the integral for F(B) becomes

Einstein appreciated that this result led to a strange behaviour of the particle distribution at
temperatures below TB. According to (11), if N is ﬁxed, we would expect that, as the temperature
decreases, F(B) would increase, but Bose–Einstein statistics show that this increase does not
continue below TB. If F(B) reaches the limiting value of 2.612, the number of particles N must
decrease at temperatures lower than TB.
Einstein realised that what had gone wrong was that the continuum approximation whereby we
replaced gi by N(E) dE does not take account of the fact that the quantised zero energy state can
contain a ﬁnite number of particles. The solution was that, at temperatures below TB, the particles
accumulate in the zero energy state and that at low enough temperatures, all the particles would
be condensed into that state. This was the discovery of the Bose–Einstein condensation. Although
it was not realised at the time, this was the ﬁrst demonstration of a phase transition using the
techniques of statistical mechanics of identical particles.
3. In 1927, Willem Keesom and Mieczyslaw Wolfke discovered the strange variation of the speciﬁc
heat capacity of helium at the lambda point at 2.19 K which was identiﬁed as a phase transition
between the phases known as He i and He ii (Keesom and Wolfke, 1928). In 1938, Fritz London
proposed interpreting this phase transition as the onset of the Bose–Einstein condensation (London,
1938). Taking the number density of liquid helium at the λ-point to be 2.18 × 1028 m−3, TB = 3.1
K. There were however concerns about this identiﬁcation since the expression (14) for TB was
derived for an ideal gas, whereas the phase transition is observed in liquid helium.
4. Throughout this chapter, I have converted Schr¨odinger’s notation of quantum numbers to modern
usage. Thus, in Schr¨odinger’s notation, the angular quantum number l is written as n.

In the case discussed in Sect. 5.4.2, the ﬁrst term in square brackets disappears because the

on the convergence properties of the integral as r →∞. Let us continue with the integration in
the x-direction. The ﬁrst term of (19) can be evaluated in the x-direction from the terms inside the

The expressions (25) and (27) are those derived by Schr¨odinger in his ﬁrst paper on wave mechanics
(Schr¨odinger, 1926b).
6. In Schr¨odinger’s paper, he uses the wave equation in the form (14.37) until he derived the energy
levels of the hydrogen atom and then infers K = h/2π. He certainly knew this relation had to be
true from the outset of the paper.
7. A simple demonstration of the origin of Maupertuis’ principle in one dimension can be obtained
from the Euler–Lagrange equation (5.59) which is derived by precisely the same procedure for
ﬁnding the stationary function between two ﬁxed points. Writing 2T for L in (5.59) and considering
only motion in the x-direction,

In a conservative ﬁeld of force, T = 1
2m ˙x2 = E −U(x) and E is the constant total energy of the
particle. Inserting these relations into (14.44), we ﬁnd immediately
m d2x
dt2 = −dU(x)
dx
= fx ,
(29)
which is Newton’s law of motion and hence the proof of Maupertuis’ principle.
8. Hamilton’s action function is deﬁned to be S =
 t
t0 L dt, where L = (T −U) is the Lagrangian, and
deﬁnes an action surface S(x, y, z, t) = constant. The properties of the action surface are directly
related to the dynamics of the particles of the system. These can be most simply appreciated from
the exposition by Landau and Lifshitz (1976). Using their notation, the expression for δS (5.58),
can be rewritten

zero and so

(31)
We now set δq(t1) = 0 and let δq(t2) = δq. Then, since ∂L/∂˙qi = p, we ﬁnd
δS = p δq ,
(32)
or, summing over all the degrees of freedom,
δS =

pi δqi .
(33)
It follows that
pi = δS

.
(34)
Thus, the components of the momentum are the gradients of the action surface S in different
directions. In general we can write
p = ∇S .
(35)
From the deﬁnition of the action given at the beginning of this endnote, the total time derivative
is

Equations (35) and (40) are those used by Hamilton in comparing particle dynamics and the paths
of light rays.
9. The simple way of deriving this result, with a great deal of hindsight, is to recognise that the
quantisation of angular momentum results in the expression J 2 = l(l + 1)¯h2. Using the fact that
the expression for the energy of a stationary state is the same in quantum mechanics as in classical
mechanics,
E = J 2

10. In the mathematical description of the propagation of a wave-packet in a dispersive medium, the
pulse shape A(x) is modulated by a ‘carrier wave’ with wavevector K. The proﬁle of the wave-
packet is therefore f (x, t = 0) = A(x) eiK x. Taking the Fourier transform of the wave-packet, we
can write
A(x) eiK x =

where ω′ = dω/dk is the group velocity and ω′′ = d2ω/dk2 is the second derivative of the angular
frequency with respect to wavenumber k.
Let us consider the representation of the motion of a uniformly moving particle by a wave-
packet. The envelope of the wave-packet is modulated by the carrier frequency which moves at
the phase velocity vph = ω/k in the positive x-direction, term (i) in (43). Term (ii) in (43) shows
that all the Fourier components of the waveform move at the group velocity, vgr = dω/dk in the
positive x-direction. For a free particle, it is shown in endnote 11 that the dispersion relation
is ω = ¯hk2/2m and so vgr = dω/dk = ¯hk/m = p/m = v, where v is the constant speed of the
particle. Thus, the wave-packet propagates with the speed of the particle it is to represent.
The term (iii) represents the dispersion of the wave because generally, in classical physics, the
group velocity is slightly different at the leading and trailing edges of the wave-packet. For a
particle moving at constant speed according to de Broglie’s hypothesis, we have shown, however,

that dω/dk = v = constant and so d2ω/dk2 = 0. In other words, there is no dispersion of the
wave-packet which represents a particle moving at constant speed in the x-direction.
11. De Broglie postulated that the wavevector k associated with the momentum of a particle should
be p = ¯hk and that the relation between the energy of the particle E and angular frequency ω
should be similar to that for photons, E = ¯hω. For a free particle, the energy is the kinetic energy
E = 1
2mv2 = p2/2m. Therefore,
E = ¯hω = p2
2m = ¯h2k2
2m ,
or
ω = ¯hk2
2m .
(44)
This dispersion relationship must be the solution of our quantum mechanical wave equation for
a free particle. The expression ω = ¯hk2/2m is signiﬁcantly different from the dispersion relation
for light waves, ω = ck. However, the group velocity, vg = dω/dk, is
vg = dω
dk = ¯hk
m = p
m = v ,
the speed of the particle, as discussed in Sect. 14.5.1.
Suppose the wavefunction for a free particle is a sine wave, ψ(x, t) = A sin(kx −ωt). Taking
the second derivative of ψ with respect to x, the expression for sin(kx −ωt) is multiplied by k2:
∂2ψ(x, t)

= −Ak2 sin(kx −ωt) .

We cannot ﬁnd an equation involving a second derivative with respect to x and a ﬁrst derivative
with respect to t if the solution is to be simply a sine wave of the form sin(kx −ωt). If instead
the solution for a free particle is to be a complex wave of the form ψ(x, t) = A exp[i(kx −ωt)],
then, taking partial derivatives with respect to x twice and once with respect to t, we ﬁnd
∂2ψ
∂x2 = −k2 Aei(kx−ωt) = −p2
¯h2 ψ ,
∂ψ
∂t = −iωAei(kx−ωt) = −i E
¯h ψ .
(47)
We can also write Eψ = p2/2mψ and so
−¯h2
2m
∂2ψ
∂x2 = i¯h ∂ψ
∂t ,
Eψ = i¯h ∂ψ
∂t .
(48)
These relations are of exactly the same form as (14.102) for the time dependence of the wave-
function.

1. I use the term Heisenberg approach to refer to matrix mechanics as developed by Born, Heisen-
berg and Jordan in their seminal papers of 1925 and 1926 (Born and Jordan, 1925b; Born et al.,
1926).
2. Note that Schr¨odinger does not use a consistent set of sufﬁces for the matrix elements used in
this development. I have largely maintained the usage in Schr¨odinger’s paper.
3. This remark was made as part of a recorded interview with Born on 17 October 1962. The
interview is preserved in the Archive for the History of Quantum Physics (see Jammer (1989)).
4. This letter was translated by van der Waerden and appears with a commentary and analysis in
his paper From matrix mechanics and wave mechanics to uniﬁed quantum mechanics (van der
Waerden, 1973).
5. The method had been previously known to mathematical physicists, prominent among them
being Harold Jeffreys. For this reason, a ‘J’ is often added to WKB and the order of the initials
may vary from country to country.

6. Speciﬁcally, on page 69 of Baker’s Principles of Geometry (1922), a set of four 2 × 2 matrices is
given as an example which could form the basis of a self-consistent non-commutative geometry.
To quote Baker, ‘Using 0, 1, i, . . . let us consider then the four symbols

it is then easy to compute that

I 2 = J 2 = K 2 = −U .’
(52)
Evidently, Dirac had to ﬁnd corresponding matrices which could represent the three orthogonal
spin orientations, σx, σy and σz.
7. I am using the conventions used by Rindler (2001) in which the Lorentz transformations are
written:
ct′ = γ (ct −V x/c) ,
x′ = γ (x −V t) ,
y′ = y ,
z′ = z ,

where γ = (1 −v2/c2)−1/2 is the Lorentz factor. The prototype displacement four-vector is R =
[ct, x, y, z] and the norm of the displacement four-vector is norm(R) = c2t2 −x2 −y2 −z2.

Physics (Longair, 2003).
2. See the discussion by Jammer (1989), pp. 328–329.
3. The essence of Heisenberg’s analysis can be appreciated using Schr¨odinger’s representation of a
particle by a wave-packet and then using de Broglie’s relations between momentum and wavelength.
A localised wave-packet can be represented by a superposition of an inﬁnite number of waves.
Following Jordan and Heisenberg, let us choose a continuous distribution of waves which has a
Gaussian distribution of amplitudes about some central wavenumber k′,
A(k) = exp

−(k −k′)2
2k2
1

.
(54)
k1 is the standard deviation of the amplitudes of the waves of different values of k about the mean
value k′. When we dealt with discrete values of kn, we described the function as a summation of
sine or cosine waves. Let us consider the cosine waves for convenience,
ψ(x) =

n
An(kn) cos knx .
(55)
Converting this into a continuous distribution of wavenumbers, ψ becomes
ψ(x) =
 +∞
−∞
A(k) cos kx dk .
(56)
We carry out this integral for the above Gaussian distribution A(k). The integral becomes
 ∞
−∞
exp

−(k −k′)2

cos kx dk .
(57)
We write cos kx = ℜ(eikx) where the symbol ℜmeans ‘take the real part of’. Therefore, the
integral becomes

(58)
Note that this expression has exactly the same form as (17.49) and explains the origin of the
complex terms in Jordan’s expression for the probability amplitude. Now, let us deal with the
expression inside the exponential. To integrate the expression, we need to complete the square and

Notice that the terms after the ‘times’ sign do not contain the variable k and so these terms can be
taken outside the integral. Now, we change variables to
y = k −k′ −ixk2

relation k = 2π/λ = 2πh/p1 and so
