ABSTRACT
Betelgeuse is a well known bright red supergiant that shows semi-regular variations with four approximate periods of 2200, 420,
230, and 185 days. While the longest period was customarily regarded as LSP (long secondary period) of unknown origin, we
identify the ∼2200-d period as the radial fundamental mode, and the three shorter periods as the radial first, second, and third
overtones. From a nonadiabatic pulsation analysis including the pulsation/convection coupling, we have found that these radial
pulsation modes are all excited in the envelope of a model in a late stage of the core-carbon burning. Models with similar pulsation
property have masses around 11 𝑀⊙(19 𝑀⊙at ZAMS) with luminosities (log 𝐿/𝐿⊙= 5.27 ∼5.28) and effective temperatures
(log𝑇eff ≈3.53) that are consistent with the range of the observational determinations. We also find that a synthetic light curve
obtained by adding the fundamental and the first-overtone mode qualitatively agrees with the light curve of Betelgeuse up to
the Great Dimming. We conclude that Betelgeuse is in the late stage of core carbon burning, and a good candidate for the next
Galactic supernova.

1 INTRODUCTION
Betelgeuse (𝛼Orionis; HD 39801) is a nearby luminous red super-
giant (M1-2 Iab-a) located approximately 200 parsec from the Sun,
has a fascinating past. Recent investigations by Neuhäuser et al.
(2022) of pre-telescopic records reveal that this star exhibited sig-
nificantly higher temperatures two millennia ago. Betelgeuse shows
semi-periodic light variations, which have been observed for more
than a century (AAVSO1).
The brightness of Betelgeuse decreased abnormally (called ‘Great
Dimming’) from December 2019 to February 2020 (by ∼1.2 mag)
around a minimum epoch of ∼400 d variation (Guinan et al. 2019).
Stimulated by the mysterious dimming, many intensive observations
in various wavelengths, and detailed analyses have been carried out.
These investigations suggest that effective temperature decreased
by ∼100 K (e.g., Dharmawardena et al. 2020; Harper et al. 2020;
Taniguchi et al. 2022; Wasatonic 2022; Mittag et al. 2023) during the
Great Dimming, and a substantial mass ejection possibly occurred
(e.g., Montargès et al. 2021; Kravchenko et al. 2021; Taniguchi et al.
2022; Dupree et al. 2022; Jadlovský et al. 2023).
Given Betelgeuse’s high luminosity and its complex variations,
which could potentially indicate an impending supernova event, the
evolution of this star has been the subject of numerous investiga-
tions (e.g., Meynet et al. 2013; Dolan et al. 2016; Wheeler et al.
2017; Nance et al. 2018; Luo et al. 2022). Its high rotation rate
𝑣eq = 6.5+4.1
−0.8km s−1 (Kervella et al. 2018) as a red supergiant has
stimulated discussions on the evolution involving merger with a past
companion (Sullivan et al. 2020) as a source of angular momentum.

Pulsation periods of the semi-regular variations of Betelgeuse are
very useful to constrain its present fundamental parameters and the
evolution stage. Periods of 2200 d and 420 d are obvious and most
frequently mentioned. So far, the 420-d period was customarily con-
sidered to be the radial fundamental mode, and the 2200-d period
to be a LSP (Long Secondary Period) caused by something other
than radial pulsations. However, we will show, in this paper, that in a
luminous supergiant like Betelgeuse long-period pulsations are very
nonadiabatic so that 2200-d period is suitable for the radial funda-
mental mode. In other words, if the 420-d period is fitted with the
radial fundamental mode, the size of Betelgeuse would be signifi-
cantly underestimated.
2 OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
2.1 Global parameters
Lobel & Dupree (2000) obtained the surface gravity log 𝑔= −0.5
and effective temperature 𝑇eff = 3500 ± 100 K by fitting of synthetic
profiles to unblended metal absorption lines in the near-IR spec-
tra. Furthermore, from CO equivalent widths for Betelgeuse Carr
et al. (2000) obtained 𝑇eff = 3540 ± 260 K. More recently, Levesque
& Massey (2020) obtained 𝑇eff = 3600 ± 25 K from optical spec-
trophotometry. Based on these spectroscopic 𝑇eff determinations for
Betelgeuse, we adopt 𝑇eff = 3500 ± 200 K for a constraint for our
models, and note that the 𝑇eff range is the same as that adopted by
Dolan et al. (2016).
As emphasized in Josselin et al. (2000), K-magnitude is more
useful in deriving bolometric luminosity of Red supergiants (RSG)
rather than V-magnitude, because the K-bolometric correction is
insensitive to the effective temperature and surface gravity. In addi-

tion, K-magnitude is less affected by interstellar extinction or pul-
sation. From the 2MASS All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources (Cutri
et al. 2003), K-magnitude of Betelgeuse is −4.378 ± 0.186 mag.
Adopting the distance of 222+48
−34 pc from the new combined ra-
dio+Hipparcos astrometric solution obtained by Harper et al. (2017),
and K-bolometric correction 2.92 ± 0.16 (Levesque et al. 2005) for
𝑇eff = 3500±200 K, we obtain log 𝐿/𝐿⊙= 5.18±0.11 for Betelgeuse
(which is similar to 5.10 ± 0.22 adopted by Dolan et al. 2016).
2.2 Observed pulsation periods
The semi-regular light variations of Betelgeuse indicate several peri-
odicities ranging from ∼2200 d to 185 d to be simultaneously excited.
Indeed, every period analysis for Betelgeuse light curve yielded more
than two periods (Jadlovský et al. 2023; Ogane et al. 2022; Wasatonic
2022; Granzer et al. 2022; Joyce et al. 2020; Kiss et al. 2006; Stothers
& Leung 1971). Table 1 lists most recent period determinations by
various authors. Among five groups of periods, we have selected the
four periods 𝑃1,𝑃2,𝑃3 and 𝑃4 as listed in the last line of Table 1.
(The 365-day period of Jadlovský et al. (2023) is considered to be
one year alias.) Regarding these four periods being caused by ra-
dial pulsations of Betelgeuse, we have searched for evolution models
which simultaneously excite pulsations of the four periods 𝑃1, . . . 𝑃4
in the range of the error box for Betelgeuse in the HR diagram.
3 MODELS
Evolution models of massive stars from ZAMS (Zero-age main-
sequence) up to the end of core-carbon burning (to the end of silicon
burning for a selected case) have been computed using the recent
version of the Geneva stellar evolution code (GENEC: Ekström et al.
2012; Yusof et al. 2022). We have assumed the same initial chemical
composition of Yusof et al. (2022); i.e., initial mass fractions of
hydrogen and heavy elements are set as 𝑋= 0.706, 𝑍= 0.020.
The mixing length to pressure scale hight is set 1.6 for the envelope
convection. Convective core boundaries are determined using the
Schwarzschild criterion with a step overshooting of 0.1 𝐻𝑝with 𝐻𝑝
being the pressure scale height at the boundary.
We adopt initial rotation velocities, 𝑣i of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 𝑣crit with
𝑣crit being the critical rotation velocity at ZAMS. While the resulted
rotation velocities in the envelopes of the red supergiants are too small
to impact the radial pulsations, rotational mixing increases effective
core mass and hence luminosity (Ekström et al. 2012; Yusof et al.
2022). Furthermore, CNO abundances at the surface are affected by
the assumed initial rotation rates.
We have obtained periods and stability (i.e, excitation/damping)
of radial pulsations of various models using the same nonadiabatic
linear radial pulsation code employed in Anderson et al. (2016) for
Cepheid pulsations. The pulsation code is based on that described
in Saio et al. (1983) but revised to include the effect of the coupling
between pulsation and time-dependent convection. As summarized in
Sec.2.2 of Anderson et al. (2016), the convection effects are included
based on the works by Unno (1967) and Grigahcène et al. (2005),
which successfully predicts the red-edge of the cepheid instability
strip. Details of the pulsation code are discussed in Appendix A.

4 RESULTS
4.1 Periods of excited radial pulsations
We have applied our non-adiabatic radial pulsation code to selected
evolution models which enter the error box on the HR diagram (Fig-
ure 1). We have found that the four radial pulsation modes having
periods similar to those observed in Betelgeuse are excited in models
located in the cooler and luminous part of the error box in the HR di-
agram as shown in Figure 1. Table 2 lists particularly good models in
which all the excited radial pulsation periods agree with the observed
four periods. These models are in the carbon-burning (or ending)
phase having luminosities in the range of 5.26 < log 𝐿/𝐿⊙< 5.28.
The mass at ZAMS was 19 𝑀⊙and has been reduced to ∼11−12 𝑀⊙
at the phase of Betelgeuse.
Note that we need a high luminosity in the upper range of error
bar, because the predicted period of the third overtone mode deviates
from 𝑃4 quickly as the luminosity decreases. In addition, in the lower
luminosity range, an additional shorter period mode (fourth overtone)
is excited, but it is not observed.
The spatial amplitude variation of each excited mode is shown
in Figure 2 (top and middle panels) by solid lines as a function of
temperature in the envelope. In calculating linear pulsation modes
we solve a set of equations with an eigenvalue 𝜎, expressing the
temporal variation of radial displacement as 𝛿𝑟exp(𝑖𝜎𝑡), in which 𝜎
and 𝛿𝑟(sometimes called the eigenfunction) are a complex number
and a complex spatial function, respectively. The actual pulsation is
expressed as the real part [𝛿𝑟exp(𝑖𝜎𝑡)]r so that the imaginary part
of 𝛿𝑟expresses the deviation from the standing wave character in the
envelope (i.e., zero points of displacement shift during a cycle of pul-

sation), and 𝜎i (imaginary part of 𝜎) gives the damping/growth rate
of the pulsation mode. In contrast to the nearly adiabatic pulsations
of the classical Cepheids, pulsations of supergiants are very non-
adiabatic so that the imaginary parts of 𝛿𝑟and 𝜎can be comparable
to the real parts.
The top panel of Figure 2 shows that 𝛿𝑟of the longest period
𝑃1 (2181 d) mode is nearly flat in the outermost layers decreasing
gently toward the center, which is exactly the property of radial
fundamental mode. For this reason we identify 𝑃1 as the fundamental
mode (rather than LSP). The displacement of 𝑃2 (434 d) mode has a
dip at log𝑇≈4.4 corresponding to a node in the adiabatic pulsation,
which indicates 𝑃2 to be the first overtone mode. No clear nodes
appear in strongly nonadiabatic pulsations, because zero points of
real and imaginary parts of 𝛿𝑟are separated. In the middle panel, 𝛿𝑟
(solid lines) 𝑃3 and 𝑃4 change rapidly with a few dips. We identify
𝑃3 and 𝑃4 as second and third overtones, respectively. We note that
all pulsations are confined in the envelope of log𝑇< 6.
Note that |𝛿𝑟|’s for short period modes (for 𝑃3 and 𝑃4) in the mid-
dle panel of Figure 2 steeply change near the surface. This indicates
that the pulsation energy of these modes leaks at the surface, for
which we apply running-wave outer boundary condition in solving
the eigenvalue problem. In spite of the leakage of energy, we find
that these pulsations still grow (i.e., 𝜎i < 0) because the driving in
the inner part exceeds the energy loss at the surface.
4.2 Work integrals
A dashed line in the top or middle panel of Figure 2 presents the
cumulative work 𝑊of each mode. The sign of the gradient 𝑑𝑊/𝑑𝑟
indicates whether the layer locally drives (𝑑𝑊/𝑑𝑟> 0) or damps
(𝑑𝑊/𝑑𝑟< 0) the pulsation. Furthermore, whether 𝑊at the surface
is positive or negative means the pulsation to be excited or damped
in the model, respectively. The cumulative work 𝑊(𝑟) is calculated
as (e.g., Saio & Cox 1980)
𝑊(𝑟) ∝
∫𝑟
0
𝑟2𝑃Im
 𝛿𝜌

𝛿𝑃∗
𝑃

𝑑𝑟,
(1)
where 𝑃and 𝜌are pressure and density, respectively, while 𝛿means
the pulsational perturbation of the next quantity, and Im(. . .) and (∗)
mean the imaginary part and the complex conjugate, respectively.
Figure 2 indicates that the fundamental mode 𝑃1 of Betelgeuse is
mainly driven in the HeII ionization zone at log𝑇∼4.5 −4.6, while
for other shorter period modes the driving in the H/HeI ionization
zone (4.0 <∼log𝑇<∼4.4) is most important.
The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows the ratio of radiative to to-
tal luminosity, 𝐿rad/𝐿tot, which is considerably smaller than unity in
large ranges of the envelope indicating a significant fraction of the to-
tal energy flux to be carried by convection. The radiative/convective
flux ratio affects the period as well as the driving/damping of the
pulsation of a star with high luminosity to mass ratio, 𝐿/𝑀> 104
(in solar units). Because the thermal time is comparable or shorter
than the dynamical time in the envelope of such a luminous star,
the pulsational variation of energy flux plays an important role to
determine the pulsation period not only to excite or damp the pul-
sation. In fact, if we obtain pulsation periods of model C (Table,2)
neglecting convective flux perturbations (which is sometimes called
frozen convection approximation) we obtain periods of 1771, 409,
253, and 192 days. Comparing these periods with periods from the
full calculations in model C, 2181, 434, 252, and 184 days, we find
including convection flux perturbation to be important for longer
period pulsations in such luminous stars.

amplitudes are normalized as 𝛿𝑅/𝑅= 1 at 𝑡= 0 for both cases and
fixed by suppressing a possible amplitude growth with time.
The amplitudes of the luminosity and the temperature variations of
the 𝑃1 mode are much smaller than the corresponding amplitudes of
the 𝑃2 mode. In addition, the luminosity maximum of 𝑃1 mode oc-
curs around the phase of maximum displacement 𝛿𝑅/𝑅, while for 𝑃2
mode it occurs around minimum 𝛿𝑅when 𝛿𝑇/𝑇is nearly maximum.
The difference comes from the different strength of the non-adiabatic
effects, which are stronger in the long-period 𝑃1 mode than in the
𝑃2 mode. Strong non-adiabaticity reduces the temperature variation
significantly so that the radius effect in the luminosity variation
𝛿𝐿/𝐿= 4𝛿𝑇eff/𝑇eff + 2𝛿𝑅/𝑅.
(2)
exceeds the temperature effect. This explains why the luminosity
maximum of the 𝑃1 mode occurs around the maximum displacement
𝛿𝑅/𝑅. In contrast, for the shorter-period 𝑃2 mode, the temperature
perturbation to be large enough to exceed the effect of 𝛿𝑅/𝑅effect so
that the luminosity maximum occurs near the phase of temperature
maximum.
4.3 Synthesis of semi-periodic variation
All recent period analyses by various authors for the Betelgeuse light
curves yielded at least periods 𝑃1 and 𝑃2 (see e.g. Table 1). This
implies that the main features of the light variations of Betelgeuse
should be qualitatively represented by a superposition of the periodic
variations of 𝑃1 and 𝑃2. In order to confirm the property, we have
Figure 3. Periodic variations for 𝛿𝑅/𝑅(black), 𝛿𝑇/𝑇(red) and 𝛿𝐿/𝐿(blue)
at the surface, predicted by the linear perturbation analysis for the two lowest
radial modes excited in model C (Table 2), while growth of amplitude is not
included. The lower and the upper panels are for the fundamental (𝑃1) and
first overtone (𝑃2) modes with periods of 2181 d and 433.6 d, respectively.
The amplitudes are arbitrarily normalized as 𝛿𝑅/𝑅= 1 at 𝑡= 0 for both
cases.
constructed a synthetic semi-periodic variation by adding the two
pulsation modes (Figure 4). We have assumed that the two modes
start (at 𝑡= 0) with the same amplitudes to each other. While a linear
pulsation analysis assumes the (infinitesimal) amplitude proportional
to exp(−𝜎𝑖𝑡) with the imaginary part of the eigenfrequency 𝜎𝑖(<
0 for an excited mode), we assume a slower growth as (1 −𝜎𝑖𝑡)
because a rapid growth should be suppressed by non-linear effects
for the (observable) finite amplitude pulsation. The radial velocity,
RV is calculated as −(2/3)𝛿𝑅/𝑑𝑡, where a factor of 2/3 presents the
projection effect from the spherical surface. The RV variation (top
panel) is plotted as red-shift (contraction) upward, and the luminosity
variation is plotted in magnitude, Δmag ≡−2.5 log(1+𝛿𝐿/𝐿), where
𝛿𝑅/𝑅and 𝛿𝐿/𝐿are sums of the two pulsation modes.
The 1.2-yr (𝑃2; first overtone) mode variations are modulated by
the superposition of the 6.0-yr (𝑃1; fundamental) mode pulsation.
The modulation amplitude grows with time as pulsation amplitudes
grow. It is particularly interesting that the brightness variation (bot-
tom panel of Fig. 4) has a deep minimum at 𝑡≈14.5 mimicking
the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse. To fit the luminosity minimum
with the Great Dimming, we have normalized the luminosity vari-
ation such that Δmag = 1.2 mag at the minimum (𝑡= 14.5) by
multiplying a factor to 𝛿𝐿(𝑡). RV(t) and 𝛿𝑇eff(𝑡) are scaled to be
consistent with the luminosity variation. On the synthesized light
curve, we have superposed V-band photometry results of Betelgeuse
from various sources (indicated in this figure), in which all observed
magnitudes are shifted by −0.5 mag (assuming the mean magnitude
to be 0.5 mag), and observed time is shifted by −2005.6 yr to fit the
time of the theoretical minimum (at 14.5 yr) with the Great Dimming
at 2020.1 yr.
During the two cycles of 𝑃2 prior to the Great Dimming, the syn-

combining the fundamental (𝑃1) and the first-overtone (𝑃2) radial pulsations
excited in model C (Table 2). The radial velocity in the top panel is set to
be positive for ’red-shift’. The brightness variations in the bottom panel is
normalized such that the maximum magnitude variation in this time range to

(2020) and Ogane et al. (2022) are over-plotted, where the mean magnitude
is assumed to be 0.5 mag and the observed dates are shifted by −2005.6 yr to
fit with the model time. In the middle panel, relative deviations of 𝑇eff from

thesized light curve agrees with observation showing minima getting
deeper, which seems to indicate the Great Dimming to be caused
by a constructive interference between the fundamental and the first
overtone pulsations (Guinan et al. 2019; Harper et al. 2020). Long
before the time at the Great Dimming the low-amplitude modula-
tions associated with the fundamental mode approximately trace the
envelope of local maxima of the light variation. During this period,
shorter period variations of 𝑃3 and 𝑃4 seem to interfere considerably
with the 𝑃2 variation.
Just after the Great Dimming, the 𝑃2 (434-d) pulsation sud-
denly became invisible and is replaced with low-amplitude shorter
timescale variations (Dupree et al. 2022; Jadlovský et al. 2023),
while the fundamental mode pulsation seems to remain intact. This
disappearance of the first-overtone pulsation suggests that a massive
mass loss (Jadlovský et al. 2023; Dupree et al. 2022) at the Great
Dimming disturbed significantly the pulsation. Since the growth time
of the first-overtone pulsation is about 5.4 yr (Fig. 2), we expect the
434-d pulsation to appear again around 2025.
The predicted effective temperature variation (middle panel of Fig-
ure 4) hardly modulates with the period 𝑃1. This is understood as that
the temperature variation of the fundamental mode (corresponding to
𝑃1) is suppressed significantly due to the strong nonadiabatic effect
as seen in Figure 3. Effective temperature variations of Betelgeuse
obtained by Harper et al. (2020); Taniguchi et al. (2022) are plotted

for comparison. While observed results have some wiggles that are
probably caused by shorter period pulsations not considered here,
the observed range of 𝑇eff variations are comparable with our simple
two-mode prediction. We note that Wasatonic (2022); Mittag et al.
(2023) also obtained similar variations in the effective temperature
of Betelgeuse.
Around the Great Dimming, the synthesized RV curve (top panel)
attains maximum (red-shift) 0.1-yr after the minimum brightness.
This phase relation agrees with the observed relation (Dupree et al.
2022). Our model predicts 4.5 km s−1 at the maximum, which is
comparable with observed values (Kravchenko et al. 2021; Dupree
et al. 2022). However, the observed minimum RV (maximum ex-
pansion velocity) about −6 km s−1 that occurred ∼200-d before the
Great Dimming is smaller than our model prediction −1 km s−1. The
discrepancy may be consistent with the emergence of a shock in the
expansion phase found by Kravchenko et al. (2021) and Dupree et al.
(2022).
4.4 Surface CNO abundance
Figure 5 shows the evolutions of luminosity, mass, and CNO abun-
dance ratios at the surface for models with different initial (at ZAMS)

second panel from the top shows that the mass-loss occurs mainly in
the red-supergiant range (core He burning stage), where up to 6 𝑀⊙
is lost. The lost mass is larger for a larger 𝑣i because of a larger
luminosity associated with larger helium core, which was produced
by extensive rotational mixing around the convective core during the
main-sequence evolution.
Because of the large mass loss in the red-supergiant stage, CNO

processed matter emerges to the surface and increases N/C and N/O
ratios. The N/C and N/O ratios of the models in the core carbon
burning stage, whose pulsation periods agree well with the observed
periods of Betelgeuse, are, unfortunately, larger than the observed
values obtained by Carr et al. (2000). As a numerical example, the
model predicts a N/C that is 0.5 dex larger than measured. This dis-
crepancy seems to indicate that the rotational diffusive mixing is
overestimated. The present computation has been performed using
specific choices for the diffusion coefficients describing the trans-
port by shear turbulence and meridional currents (see references in
Ekström et al. 2012). The choice made in the present computation ac-
tually favors the mixing. Other choices would have produced smaller
results. As a numerical example, models of 15 M⊙with an initial
rotation equal to 40% the critical velocity at solar metallicity have
been computed with different choices of these diffusion coefficients
(see Nandal et al.2023 in preparation). The N/C ratio at the surface
when log𝑇eff = 3.6 can be reduced up to 0.5 dex changing the ex-
pressions of the diffusion coefficients describing the shear mixing.
Thus indeed, the solution to that problem can be linked to the specific
physics used here for rotational mixing. These models would how-
ever present similar structure of their envelope at the red supergiant
stage and thus we do not expect this will influence the properties of
the pulsation modes during that stage.
5 DISCUSSION
Our models that excite four radial pulsations consistent with observed
four periods of Betelgeuse (Table 2) have radii larger than 1200 𝑅⊙,
which are much larger than the previous seismological predictions
(∼800 to ∼900 𝑅⊙) by Joyce et al. (2020) and Dolan et al. (2016).
The difference arises from the fact that the previous analyses fitted the
period 𝑃2 (∼420 d) with the period of the radial fundamental pulsa-
tion, regarding the periodicity 𝑃1 (∼2200 d) to be a non-pulsational
origin. In contrast, we have fitted the period 𝑃1 with the fundamen-
tal non-adiabatic pulsation period of a core-carbon-burning model
having a radius of ∼1300 𝑅⊙(Table 2). The model excites not only
the fundamental mode which fits with 𝑃1 but also excites the first,
second, and third overtones whose periods agree with the observed
periods 𝑃2, 𝑃3, and 𝑃4, respectively.
The large radii of our models have some supports from interfer-
ometric observations of the angular diameter. Haubois et al. (2009)
obtained the angular diameter of Betelgeuse to be 45.03 ± 0.12 mas
which was confirmed by Neilson et al. (2011). Combining the angu-
lar diameter with the distance 222+48
−34 pc (Harper et al. 2017) yields
𝑅(𝛼Ori) = 1074+232
−165 𝑅⊙, which agrees with our models in Table 2.
Furthermore, Cannon et al. (2023) obtained an angular diameter of
59.02±0.64 mas in the spectral range between 8 and 8.75 𝜇m, which
corresponds to a radius 1409+319
−229𝑅⊙at the same distance as above.
In addition, we note that Weiner et al. (2000) obtained the angular
diameter 55.2 ± 0.5 mas at a wavelength of 11.15 𝜇m. All these in-
terferometric results with the 222-pc distance agree with the radii of
our models for Betelgeuse.
Furthermore, fitting interferometric observations with the limb-
darkening law, Neilson et al. (2011) obtained the radius to mass
ratio 𝑅/𝑀= 82.17+13.32
−11.51𝑅⊙/𝑀⊙, while our models in Table 2 give
𝑅/𝑀= 110 ± 2 𝑅⊙/𝑀⊙. Although 𝑅/𝑀of our models are slightly
larger than the Neilson et al. (2011)’s estimate, we do not think the
difference serious because the mass-loss rate assumed as a function
of stellar parameters certainly has some deviations from the real
mass-loss rates.
Kervella et al. (2018) estimated an equatorial rotation velocity of
Figure 6. Central abundances of various elements versus time (in logarithm
of base 10) to collapse for the model of 𝑀i = 19 𝑀⊙with the initial rotation
velocity 𝑣i = 0.2 𝑣crit.
𝑣eq = 6.5+4.1
−0.8km s−1. In contrast, our models of Betelgeuse have
rotation velocity less than 0.1 km s−1 even if they were rotating at
40% of critical value at the ZAMS stage. The lack of rotation is
common to the single-star models of Betelgeuse, as Wheeler et al.
(2017) proposes a merger with another star to get additional angular
momentum (see also Sullivan et al. 2020).
We have found that four periods of the photometric variations of
Betelgeuse are consistent with the four lowest order radial pulsations
in the carbon burning models which evolved from an initial stellar
mass of 19 𝑀⊙. As shown in Table 2, the evolution stage can be
very close to the carbon exhaustion. In fact, it is not possible to
determine the exact evolutionary stage, because surface conditions
hardly change in the late stage close to the carbon exhaustion and
beyond, while the property of radial pulsation depends only in the
envelope structure. To see the time to a core-collapse after the core
carbon exhaustion, we have extended the evolution for the model with
𝑣i = 0.2𝑣crit to the silicon exhaustion. Figure 6 depicts the central
abundance of elements of the model versus time to the collapse.
According to this figure, the core will collapse in a few tens years
after the carbon exhaustion. This indicates Betelgeuse to be a very
good candidate for the next Galactic supernova which occurs very
near to us.
6 CONCLUSION
We have found carbon-burning models that excite the radial funda-
mental mode, as well as the first, second, and third overtones. The
periods excited pulsation modes agree with periods of 2190, 417,
230, and 185 d that had been detected in Betelgeuse. On the HR dia-
gram, these models are located within the allowed range of effective
temperature and luminosity of Betelgeuse. Beginning with a mass
of 19 𝑀⊙at ZAMS (with a rotation velocity of 0.2 or 0.4 𝑣crit), the
models lose significant mass mainly in the core-He burning stage to

have a mass of 11 ∼12 𝑀⊙in the core carbon-burning stage. A large
radius of about 1300 𝑅⊙(needed for the long-period fundamental
mode) is supported by interferometric measurements of the angular
diameter combined with the distance. We conclude that Betelgeuse
should currently be in a late phase (or near the end) of the core car-
bon burning. After carbon is exhausted in the core, a core-collapse
leading to a supernova explosion is expected in a few tens years.

APPENDIX A: RADIAL PULSATION COUPLED WITH
CONVECTION
In this appendix we derive differential equations to solve radial pul-
sations taking into account the coupling with convection based on
the mixing-length theory. In the beginning we follow Unno (1967)’s
discussion but later we include additional terms to avoid rapid oscil-
lations where the turnover time is longer than the pulsation period
(e.g. Grigahcène et al. 2005). We summarise differential equations
of radial pulsations in the last part of this appendix.

perturbation. We neglect convective perturbation of the gravitational

A2 Equations for mean fluid
Taking a horizontal average (𝑽c = 0, (. . .)′ = 0) of equation(A1),
and assuming the Boussinesq approximation for convection motions,
we have
𝜌𝑑𝒖
𝑑𝑡+ 𝜌𝑽c · ∇𝑽c = −∇𝑃−𝜌∇𝜓,
(A4)
where the second term on the left-hand-side is the turbulent stress.
where we have defined

Similarly, taking horizontal averages of equations (A2) and (A3)
we obtain

and
𝜌𝑇𝑑𝑆
𝑑𝑡+ 𝜌𝑇𝑽c · ∇𝑆′ = 𝜌𝜖n −∇· 𝑭rad,

where we have assumed that |𝑇′| ≪𝑇and |𝜌′| ≪𝜌. Since ∇·𝑽c = 0
(Boussinesq approximation) and hence 𝑽c · ∇𝑆′ = ∇· (𝑽c𝑆′), we
approximately write equation (A7) as
𝜌𝑇𝑑𝑆
𝑑𝑡= 𝜌𝜖n −∇· 𝑭rad −∇· 𝑭con,

with defining the convective flux as
𝑭con ≡𝜌𝑇𝑽c𝑆′

A3 Equations for time-dependent convection
A3.1 Mechanical equations
Subtracting equation (A4) from equation (A1) and neglecting a non-
linear term 𝜌𝒖· ∇𝒖, we obtaine
𝜌𝑑𝑽c
𝑑𝑡+ 𝜌(𝑽c · ∇𝑽c −𝑽c · ∇𝑽c) + 𝜌𝑽c · ∇𝒖= −∇𝑃′ −𝜌′∇𝜓. (A15)
Here we have disregard 𝜌′ in the left hand side of equation (A1),
because we are using the Boussinesq approximation for convective
motion. Following Unno (1967)’s conjecture that convection motion
would approach to equilibrium in a time scale of the turnover time
of convective eddies, we assume that
𝑽c · ∇𝑽c −𝑽c · ∇𝑽c = 𝛼
 1
𝜏+ 𝜎r

𝑽c,
(A16)
where 𝛼is a numerical parameter of order one, and 𝜏is the turnover
time of convective eddies, which may be written as
𝜏= ℓ/𝑣
(A17)
with mixing length ℓand 𝑣≡|𝑉𝑟c |.
We have included 𝜎r (the real part of pulsation frequency) in
equation (A16) in addition to Unno (1967)’s original 1/𝜏term, in
order to prevent rapid spacial oscillations in pulsation amplitude that
occur near the bottom of the convection zone (where 𝜏≫1/𝜎r)
(Gonczi & Osaki 1980; Grigahcène et al. 2005). This modification
comes from the conjecture that if the pulsation period is much shorter
than the turn-over time 𝜏(associated with largest eddies), smaller
scale eddies having time-scales of ∼1/𝜎r would be important (Saio
1980). Similar assumption was adopted by Grigahcène et al. (2005).
Substituting equation (A16) into equation (A15) we obtain

A4 Pulsational perturbation on convection
In this subsection we consider spherical symmetric (radial) linear
Lagrangian perturbation 𝛿for convective eddies which, as in the
previous subsection, are treated locally. We will present 𝛿𝑉𝑟and 𝛿𝑆′
(convection variables perturbed by pulsation) as functions of regular
pulsation variables.

From equation (A19) we obtain

Taking the inner product between 𝒌and equation (A48) and using

(A53)
In deriving equation (A52), we assumed the relation 𝛿𝑣/𝑣= 𝛿𝑉𝑟c /𝑉𝑟
c0,
and used the relation between 𝑆′
0 and 𝑉𝑟
c0 given in equation (A35).
We also used the relation

(A54)
which can be derived from the relations 𝒌· 𝑽c0 = 0 (eq. A33) and
𝑘2𝑟/𝑘2 = 2𝑄/3 (eq. A43).
From equations (A46) and (A52) we can express 𝛿𝑉𝑟c /𝑉𝑟c and
𝛿𝑆′/𝑆′ as functions of pulsation variables, which are used in equa-
tion (A61) (below) to obtain the Lagrangian perturbation of convec-
tive luminosity, 𝛿𝐿conv.
A5 Equations for linear radial pulsations

sure 𝛿𝑃, and entropy 𝛿𝑆, linearised momentum (A4) and mass con-
servation (A6) equations can be written as
