ABSTRACT 
The RFID is a rapidly developing technology. It’s used in many applications such as logistics, ticketing, security, em-
ployee attendance record and others. Also, fractal technology is used in many areas, and recently in antenna design be-
cause it allows making multi-band and wide-band antennas. In this paper, two tri-band fractal antennas are studied for 
the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications using the Method of Moment (MoM). The first one is designed 
for the RFID readers and it operates at 3.85 GHZ, 5.80 GHZ and 8.12 GHZ. The second one is designed for the RFID 
Tags and it operates at 3.94 GHZ, 5.65 GHZ and 8.20 GHZ.

1. Introduction 
RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification, a term 
that describes any system of identification wherein an 
electronic device that uses radio frequency or magnetic 
field variations to communicate is attached to an item. 
The two most talked-about components of an RFID sys-
tem are the tag, which is the identification device atta- 
ched to the item we want to track, and the reader, which 
is a device that can recognize the presence of RFID tags 
and read the information stored on them. The reader can 
then inform another system about the presence of the 
tagged items. The system with which the reader commu-
nicates usually runs software that stands between readers 
and applications. This software is called RFID middle-
ware [1]. 
In a typical RFID system [2], passive tags are attached 
to an object such as goods, vehicles, humans, animals, 
and shipments, while a vertical/circular polarization an-
tenna is connected to the RFID reader. The RFID reader 
and tag can radio-communicate with each other using a 
number of different frequencies, and currently most 
RFID systems use unlicensed spectrum. The common 
frequencies used are low frequency (125 KHz), high 
frequency (13.56 MHz), ultra high frequency (860 - 960 
MHz/2.45 GHz), and microwave frequency (3.6/3.9/5.8/ 
5.9/8.2 GHZ [3]). The typical RFID readers are able to  
read (or detect) the tags of only a single frequency but 
multimode readers are becoming cheaper and popular 
which are capable of reading the tags of different fre-
quencies [4]. 
Several calculation methods are adopted to solve the 
Maxwell equations and then study the performance of the 
antennas. Among these, two are widely used in simula-
tion software:  
1) The method of moments (MoM) is used among oth-
ers in FEKO software (an abbreviation derived from the 
German phrase FEldberechnung bei Körpern mit belie-
biger Oberfläche (Field computations involving bodies of 
arbitrary shape)) [5].  
2) The method of finite integral (FIT) is used in the 
software CST Microwave Studio (Computer Simulation 
Technology Microwave Studio) [6]. 
In this work, we use the FEKO software. 
2. Fractal Antennas 
The fractal antennas use fractals and self-similar models. 
Several studies show that we can easily make compact, 
multi-band and wide-band antennas, suitable for minia-
turization and various applications such as RFID, WLAN 
(Wireless Local Area Network), WIMAX (WorldWide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access), WIFI (WIreless 
FIdelity) [7-9].

3. Antennas Geometry 
3.1. Readers Antennas 
The reader antenna is a fractal antenna 2nd iteration (Fig-
ure 1). 
The antenna is fed by a Coplanar Waveguide (CPW). 
The antenna, the feeding point and the ground plane are 
on the same plane (Figure 2). Several studies have used 
this mode of feeding [10-13]. 
The antenna is designed on an FR4 substrate (relative 
dielectric constant = 4.3, thickness = 1.6 mm, loss tan-
gent = 0.025). The overall dimension of the substrate is 
40 × 60 mm². 
The dimensions of the antenna are: L1 = 60 mm, L2 = 
40 mm, L3 = 22 mm, H = 1.6 mm, H1 = 23 mm, H2 = 21 
mm, H3 = 10 mm, W = 2.2 mm, S = 1 mm, G = 0.5 mm, 
 = 20˚,  = 40˚ (Figure 3). 
3.2. Tag Antenna  
The Tag antenna is a fractal antenna 3rd iteration (Figure 
4). 
The antenna is fed by a Coplanar Waveguide (CPW). 
The antenna, the feeding point and the ground plane are 
on the same plane (Figure 5). 
The antenna is designed on an FR4 substrate (relative 
dielectric constant = 4.3, thickness = 1.6 mm, loss tan-
gent = 0.025). The overall dimension of the substrate is 
30 × 90 mm². 
The dimensions of the antenna are: L1 = 90 mm, L2 = 
30 mm, L3 = 10 mm, H = 1.6 mm, W = 2.4 mm, S = 1 
mm, G = 1 mm (Figure 6).

For each one of the antennas, the read range calcula-
tion is done by taking a reference antenna of gain 3 dBi 
and minimum detectable power of 1 mW. The transmit-
ting power is 4 W [3]. Therefore, we can build the table 
below (Table 1). 
6. Comparison with other Methods of 
Calculation 
This study has been done with The CST Microwave Stu-
dio which is based on the finite integral method (FIT) [3]. 
Our results are similar, but with small differences sum- 
marized in the Table 2. 
Comparing these results, we note that:  
 For the Reader, there is a small frequency lag of 0.25 
GHZ (f1 FIT = 3.6 GHZ and f1 MoM = 3.85 GHZ) 
 For the Tag, there is a small frequency lag of 0.25 
GHZ (f2 FIT = 5.9 GHZ and f1 MoM = 5.65 GHZ) 
7. Conclusions 
The fractal antennas are preferred due to small size, light 
weight and multiband. This paper introduced RFID rea- 
der and tag antennas. The reader antenna exhibits a −10 
dB bandwidth of 305 MHz at 3.85 GHz, 201 MHz at 5.8

its a −10 dB bandwidth of 165 MHz at 3.94 GHz, 149 
MHz at 5.65 GHz, and 166 MHz at 8.2 GHz. The maxi-
mum read range obtained by the reader antenna is 74.72 
cm, and 83.83 cm by the tag antenna. 
By simulating the antennas using the Method of Moment 
(MoM) and comparing the results with another study using 
the method of finite integral (FIT), we find that the results 
are similar, even if there are small lags that are tolerable.
