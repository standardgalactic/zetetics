Preface
The present volume is based on the international conference Quantum Mathematical
Physics – A Bridge between Mathematics and Physics that was held at the
University of Regensburg (Germany) from September 29 to October 2, 2014. This
conference was a successor of similar international conferences which took place
at the Heinrich-Fabri Institute (Blaubeuren) in 2003 and 2005, at the Max Planck
Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences (Leipzig) in 2007 and at the University
of Regensburg in 2010. The basic intention of this series of conferences is to bring
together mathematicians and physicists to discuss profound questions in quantum
ﬁeld theory and gravity. More speciﬁcally, the series aims at discussing concepts
which underpin different mathematical and physical approaches to quantum ﬁeld
theory and gravity.
Since the invention of general relativity and quantum mechanics at the beginning
of the twentieth century, physicists made an enormous effort to incorporate gravity
and quantum physics into a uniﬁed framework. In doing so, many approaches have
been developed to overcome the basic conceptual and mathematical differences
between quantum theory and general relativity. Moreover, both quantum theory and
general relativity have their own problems and shortcomings. It turns out that many
of these problems are related to each other and to the problem of the uniﬁcation of
quantum theory and gravity. The aim of the conference was to shed light on these
problems and to indicate possible solutions.
On one hand, general relativity describes systems on large scales (like the solar
system, galaxies, and cosmological phenomena). This is reﬂected in the fact that
in general relativity, space-time has locally the simple structure of Minkowski
space, whereas gravitational effects usually show up in the large-scale geometry.
Under generic assumptions, there are phenomena like black holes and cosmological
singularities which are not yet understood in a physically satisfying way. Quantum
theory, on the other hand, usually describes systems on small scales (like atoms,
nuclei, or elementary particles). Indeed, on small scales the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle becomes relevant and quantum effects come into play. One of the open
problems is that there is no satisfying mathematical description of interacting
quantum ﬁelds.

Preface
One of the fundamental difﬁculties in combining gravity with quantum physics
lies in the fact that general relativity is a theory on the dynamics of space-time
itself, whereas quantum theory usually aims to describe the dynamics of matter
within a given space-time background (in the simplest case by Minkowski space).
Moreover, the geometric description of general relativity makes it necessary to
describe objects locally in an arbitrary small neighborhood of a point. But localizing
quantum mechanical wave functions to such a small neighborhood, the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle gives rise to large energy ﬂuctuations. Considering these
energy ﬂuctuations as a gravitational source, one obtains a contradiction to the
above picture that gravity comes into play only on large scales. Thus, although both
theories are experimentally well conﬁrmed, they seem to conceptually contradict
each other. This incompatibility also becomes apparent in the mathematical formu-
lation: From a mathematical perspective, general relativity is usually regarded as a
purely geometric theory. However, quantum physics is described mathematically in
an algebraic and functional analytic language.
There are various approaches to overcome these issues. For instance, in string
theory one replaces point-like particles by one-dimensional objects. Other ap-
proaches, like loop quantum gravity, causal fermion systems, or noncommutative
geometry, rely on the assumption that the macroscopic smooth space-time structure
should emerge from more fundamental structures on the microscopic scale. Alter-
natively, one tries to treat interacting theories as “effective theories” or considers
quantum theory from an axiomatic and categorical view point in a way that allows
to incorporate the concept of local observers. Most of these modern mathematical
approaches to unify quantum physics with general relativity have the advantage to
combine geometric structures with algebraic and functional analytic methods. Some
of these “quantum mathematical concepts” are discussed in the present conference
volume.
The carefully selected and refereed articles in this volume either give a survey
or focus on speciﬁc issues. They explain the state of the art of various rigorous
approaches to quantum ﬁeld theory and gravity. Most of the articles are based on
talks at the abovementioned conference. All talks of the conference were recorded,
and most are available online at
http://www.ur.de/qft2014.
For the ﬁrst time, the conference included two evening talks devoted to new
experimental developments (dark matter/energy and the Higgs particle). It was again
a main purpose of the conference to set the stage for stimulating discussions. To this
end, extra time slots were reserved for panel and plenary discussions. Here is a list
of some of the questions raised in the discussions:
1. Quantum gravity: What should a physically convincing theory of quantum
gravity accomplish? Which are the most promising directions to ﬁnd such a
theory of quantum gravity? Why does one need to “quantize” gravity – is it not
sufﬁcient to describe it classically? How important is mathematical consistency?
2. Quantization: Do quantum ﬁeld theories necessarily arise by quantizing a
classical ﬁeld theory? Is such a quantization procedure necessary in order to

Preface

have a physical interpretation of the resulting quantum ﬁeld theory? Does it make
physical sense to quantize pure gravity without matter?
3. Future perspectives: Which directions in mathematical physics seem most
promising for young researchers to work on? Is it recommendable for young
researchers to study new topics or should they rather work on well-established
problems? Which are the big challenges for mathematical physics in the next
years?
4. Axiomatic frameworks: Do the various axiomatic frameworks (such as alge-
braic quantum ﬁeld theory, causal fermion systems, noncommutative geometry,
etc.) offer a suitable framework for unifying gravity and quantum theory? Can
causality be expected to hold?
5. Dark energy and dark matter: Is dark energy related to quantum ﬁeld theoretic
effects like vacuum ﬂuctuations? Or do the explanations of dark energy and dark
matter require new physical concepts? Should dark matter and dark energy be
considered as some kind of “matter” or “ﬁeld” in space-time?
6. Mathematics of future theories: Which contemporary mathematical develop-
ments might play an important role in the formulation of new physical theories?
We are grateful to Klaus Fredenhagen (Hamburg), José Maria Gracia-Bondia
(Madrid), Gerhard Börner (München), and Harald Grosse (Wien) for contributing
to the discussions as members of the panel. The discussions were moderated by

Abstract The connection between spin and statistics is examined in the context of
locally covariant quantum ﬁeld theory. A generalization is proposed in which locally
covariant theories are deﬁned as functors from a category of framed spacetimes to
a category of -algebras. This allows for a more operational description of theories
with spin, and for the derivation of a more general version of the spin-statistics
connection in curved spacetimes than previously available. The proof involves a
“rigidity argument” that is also applied in the standard setting of locally covariant
quantum ﬁeld theory to show how properties such as Einstein causality can be
transferred from Minkowski spacetime to general curved spacetimes.

Introduction
In conclusion we wish to state, that according to our opinion the connection between spin
and statistics is one of the most important applications of the special relativity theory.
W. Pauli, in [33].
It is an empirical fact that observed elementary particles are either bosons
of integer spin, or fermions of half-integer spin. Explanations of this connection
between spin and statistics have been sought since the early days of quantum ﬁeld
theory. Fierz [19] and Pauli [33] investigated the issue in free ﬁeld theories, setting
in train a number of progressively more general results. The rigorous proof of a
connection between spin and statistics was an early and major achievement of the
axiomatic Wightman framework; see [5, 30] and the classic presentation in [38].
Similarly, general results have been proved in the Haag–Kastler framework [23],
for example, [8, 9, 22]. In these more algebraic settings, statistics is not tied
to the properties of particular ﬁelds, but is understood in terms of the graded
commutativity of local algebras corresponding to spacelike-separated regions [9],
or the properties of super-selection sectors [8, 22].
Nonetheless, the theoretical account of the spin-statistics connection is subtle
and even fragile. Nonrelativistic models of quantum ﬁeld theory are not bound by
it, and as Pauli observed [33], one may impose bosonic statistics on a Dirac ﬁeld
at the cost of sacriﬁcing positivity of the Hamiltonian. Ghost ﬁelds introduced in
gauge theories violate the connection, but also involve indeﬁnite inner products.
The rigorous proofs therefore rely on Hilbert space positivity and energy positivity.
Moreover, they make essential use of the Poincaré symmetry group and its complex
extension together with analyticity properties of the vacuum n-point functions. The
spin-statistics connection observed in nature, however, occurs in a spacetime which
is not Minkowski space and indeed has no geometrical symmetries. There is neither
a global notion of energy positivity (or, more properly, the spectrum condition) nor
do we expect n-point functions in typical states of interest on generic spacetimes to
have analytic extensions. Thus the general proofs mentioned have no traction and
it is far from clear how they can be generalized: a priori it is quite conceivable that
the theoretical spin-statistics connection is an accident of special relativity that is
broken in passing to the curved spacetimes of general relativity. Indeed, for many
years, work on the spin-statistics connection in curved spacetimes was restricted
to demonstrations that free models become inconsistent on general spacetimes if
equipped with the wrong statistics (e.g., imposing anticommutation relations on
a scalar ﬁeld) [32, 41] unless some other important property such as positivity is
sacriﬁced [24].
The breakthrough was made by Verch [39], who established a general spin-
statistics theorem for theories deﬁned on each spacetime by a single ﬁeld which,
in particular, obeys Wightman axioms in Minkowski space. Together with [27],
this paper was responsible for laying down many of the foundations of what has

On the Spin-Statistics Connection in Curved Spacetimes

become the locally covariant framework for QFT in curved spacetimes [2]. Verch’s
assumptions allow certain properties of the theory on one spacetime to be deduced
from its properties on another, provided the spacetimes are suitably related by
restrictions or deformations of the metric. In particular, the spin-statistics connection
is proved by noting that if it were violated in any one spacetime, it would be violated
in Minkowski space, contradicting the classic spin-statistics theorem.
Nonetheless, there are good reasons to revisit the spin-statistics connection in
curved spacetime. First, as a matter of principle, one would like to gain a better
understanding of why spin is the correct concept to investigate in curved spacetime,
given the lack of the rotational symmetries that are so closely bound up with
the description of spin in Minkowski space. A second, related, point is that [39]
describes spinor ﬁelds as sections of various bundles associated to the spin bundle.
While this is conventional wisdom in QFT in CST, it has the effect of basing the
discussion on geometric structures that are, in part, unobservable. This is not a great
hindrance if the aim is to discuss a particular model such as the Dirac ﬁeld. However,
we wish to understand the spin-statistics connection for general theories, without
necessarily basing the description on ﬁelds at all. With that goal in mind, one needs a
more fundamental starting point that avoids the insertion of spin by hand. Third, the
result proved in [39] is conﬁned to theories in which the algebra in each spacetime
is generated by a single ﬁeld, and the argument is indirect in parts. The purpose of
this contribution is to sketch a new and operationally well-motivated perspective on
the spin-statistics connection in which spin emerges as a natural concept in curved
spacetimes, and which leads to a more general and direct proof of the connection.
In particular, there is no longer any need to describe the theory in terms of one or
more ﬁelds. Full details will appear shortly [10].
The key ideas are (a) a formalisation of the reasoning underlying [39] as a ‘rigid-
ity argument’, and (b) a generalization of locally covariant QFT based on a category
of spacetimes with global coframes (i.e., a ‘rods and clocks’ account of spacetime
measurements). As in [39] the goal is to prove that a spin-statistics connection in
curved spacetime is implied by the standard results holding in Minkowski space;
however, the proof becomes quite streamlined in the new formulation. We begin
by describing the standard version of locally covariant QFT, describing the rigidity
argument and some of its other applications in that context, before moving to the
discussion of framed spacetimes and the spin-statistics theorem.
2
Locally Covariant QFT
Locally covariant QFT is a general framework for QFT in curved spacetimes,
due to Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch (BFV) [2], which comprises three main
assumptions. The ﬁrst is the assertion that any quantum ﬁeld theory respecting
locality and covariance can be described by a covariant functor A W Loc ! Alg

4
C.J. Fewster
from the category of globally hyperbolic spacetimes Loc to a category Alg of unital
-algebras.1
This assumption already contains a lot of information and we shall unpack it in
stages, beginning with the spacetimes. Objects of Loc are oriented and time-oriented
globally hyperbolic spacetimes (of ﬁxed dimension n) and with ﬁnitely many
components.2 Morphisms between spacetimes in Loc are hyperbolic embeddings,
i.e., isometric embeddings preserving time and space orientations with causally
convex image.
The category Alg has objects that are unital -algebras, with morphisms that are
injective, unit-preserving -homomorphisms. The functoriality condition requires
that the theory assigns an object A.M/ of Alg to each spacetime M of Loc, and,
furthermore, that each hyperbolic embedding of spacetimes  W M ! N is mirrored
by an embedding of the corresponding algebras A. / W A.M/ ! A.N/, such that
A.idM/ D idA.M/
and
A.' ı  / D A.'/ ı A. /
(1)
for all composable embeddings ' and  .
Despite its somewhat formal expression, this assumption is well-motivated from
an operational viewpoint3 and provides a natural generalization of the Haag–
Kastler–Araki axiomatic description of quantum ﬁeld theory in Minkowski space.
Indeed, as emphasized by BFV, this single assumption already contains several
distinct assumptions of the Minkowski framework.
The next ingredient in the BFV framework is the kinematic net indexed by O.M/,
the set of all open causally convex subsets of M with ﬁnitely many connected
components. Each nonempty O 2 O.M/ can be regarded as a spacetime MjO in
its own right, by restricting the causal and metric structures of M to O, whereupon
the inclusion map of O into the underlying manifold M induces a Loc morphism
O W MjO ! M (see Fig. 1). The theory A therefore assigns an algebra A.MjO/ and
an embedding of this algebra into A.M/, and we deﬁne the kinematic subalgebra to
be the image
A kin.MI O/ WD A.O/.A.MjO//:
(2)
As mentioned above, the net O 7! A kin.MI O/ is the appropriate generalization of
the net of local observables studied in Minkowski space AQFT. Some properties are
1Other target categories are often used, e.g., the unital C-algebra category C-Alg, and other
types of physical theory can be accommodated by making yet other choices.
2It is convenient to describe the orientation by means of a connected component of the set of
nonvanishing n-forms, and likewise to describe the time-orientation by means of a connected
component of the set of nonvanishing timelike 1-form ﬁelds. Our signature convention throughout
is C     .
3For a discussion of how the framework can be motivated on operational grounds (and as an
expression of ‘ignorance principles’) see [13, 15].

that
A kin.NI  .O// D A. /.A kin.MI O//
(3)
for all morphisms  W M ! N and all nonempty O 2 O.M/. This is an immediate
consequence of the deﬁnitions above and functoriality of A. Similarly spacetime
symmetries of M are realised as automorphisms of the kinematic net in a natural
way.
It is usual to assume two additional properties. First, the theory obeys Einstein
causality if, for all causally disjoint O1; O2 2 O.M/ (i.e., no causal curve joins
O1 to O2), the corresponding kinematic algebras commute elementwise. Second,
A is said to have the timeslice property if it maps every Cauchy morphism, i.e.,
a morphism whose image contains a Cauchy surface of the ambient spacetime, to
an isomorphism in Alg. This assumption encodes the dynamics of the theory and
plays an important role in allowing the instantiations of A on different spacetimes
to be related. In fact, two spacetimes M and N in Loc can be linked by a chain of
Cauchy morphisms if and only if their Cauchy surfaces are related by an orientation-
preserving diffeomorphism (see [17, Prop. 2.4], which builds on an older argument
of Fulling, Narcowich and Wald [21]). The construction used is shown schematically
in Fig. 2: the main point is the construction of the interpolating spacetime I that
‘looks like’ N in its past and M in its future. The assumption that A has the timeslice
property entails the existence of an isomorphism between A.M/ and A.N/; indeed,
there are many such isomorphisms, because there is considerable freedom in the
choice of interpolating spacetime, none of which can be regarded as canonical.
The assumptions just stated are satisﬁed by simple models, such as the free
Klein–Gordon ﬁeld [2], and, importantly, by perturbatively constructed models of a
scalar ﬁeld with self-interaction [1, 26, 27]. In order to be self-contained, we brieﬂy
describe the free theory corresponding to the minimally coupled Klein–Gordon
theory, with ﬁeld equation .M C m2/ D 0: in each spacetime M 2 Loc, one

is constructed from the advanced () and retarded (C) Green operators (which
obey supp .E˙

M.supp f/). This deﬁnes the objects of the theory; for the
morphisms, any hyperbolic embedding  W M ! N determines a unique morphism
A. / W A.M/ ! A.N/ with the property
A. /ˆM. f/ D ˆN. f/
.f 2 C1
0 .M//;
(5)
where   is the push-forward. The proof that A. / is well-deﬁned as a morphism
of Alg relies on the properties of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, the deﬁnition
of hyperbolic embeddings, and some algebraic properties of the algebras A.M/
[notably, that they are simple].
Our discussion will use two more features of the general structure. First, let
D be the functor assigning test function spaces to spacetimes, D.M/ D C1
0 .M/,
and the push-forward to morphisms D. / D  . Then (5) precisely asserts the
existence of a natural transformation ˆ between the functors D and A (modulo a
forgetful functor from Alg to the category of vector spaces) [2]. We take this as the
prototype of what a ﬁeld should be in the locally covariant setting, allowing for ﬁelds
depending nonlinearly on the test function by using a forgetful functor from Alg to
the category of sets, and for other tensorial types by suitable alternative choices of
D. As will be discussed later, spinorial ﬁelds require a modiﬁcation of the category
Loc.
Second, natural transformations may also be used to compare locally covariant
theories. A natural  W A
:! B is interpreted as an embedding of A as a subtheory
of B, while a natural isomorphism indicates that the theories are physically
equivalent [2, 17]. Naturality requires that to each M 2 Loc there is a morphism
M W A.M/ ! B.M/
N ı A. / D B. / ı M
(6)
for each morphism  W M ! N. The interpretation of  as a subtheory embedding
can be justiﬁed on several grounds – see [17].

On the Spin-Statistics Connection in Curved Spacetimes

The equivalences of A with itself form the group Aut.A/ of automorphisms of
the functor. This has a nice physical interpretation: it is the global gauge group [14].
Locally covariant QFT is not merely an elegant formalism for rephrasing known
results and models, but has also led to new departures in the description of QFT
in curved spacetimes. These can be divided into those that are model-independent
and those that are speciﬁc to particular theories. Those of the former type include
the spin-statistics connection [39]; the introduction of the relative Cauchy evolution
and intrinsic understanding of the stress-energy tensor [2]; an analogue of the
Reeh–Schlieder theorem [11, 34] and the split property [11]; new approaches to
superselection theory [3, 4] and the understanding of global gauge transforma-
tions [14]; a no-go theorem for preferred states [17], and a discussion of how one
can capture the idea that a theory describes ‘the same physics in all spacetimes’
[17]. Model-speciﬁc applications include, above all, the perturbative construction
of interacting models [1, 26, 27], including those with gauge symmetries [20, 25].
However, there are also applications to the theory of Quantum Energy Inequalities
[12, 16, 31] and cosmology [6, 7, 40].

A Rigidity Argument
The framework of local covariance appears quite loose, but in fact the descriptions of
the theory in different spacetimes are surprisingly tightly related. There are various
interesting properties which, if they hold in Minkowski space, must also hold in
general spacetimes. This will apply in particular to the spin–statistics connection;
as a warm-up, let us see how such arguments can be used in the context of Einstein
causality, temporarily relaxing our assertion of this property as an axiom.
For M 2 Loc, let O.2/.M/ be the set of ordered pairs of spacelike separated
open globally hyperbolic subsets of M. For any such pair hO1; O2i 2 O.2/.M/,
let PM.O1; O2/ be true if A kin.MI O1/ and A kin.MI O2/ commute elementwise and
false otherwise. We might say that A satisﬁes Einstein causality for hO1; O2i. It is
easily seen that there are relationships between these propositions:
R1
for all hO1; O2i 2 O.2/.M/,
PM.O1; O2/ ” PM.DM.O1/; DM.O2//;
where DM denotes the Cauchy development;
R2

PM.O1; O2/ H) PM.eO1; eO2/:

8
C.J. Fewster
R3 is an immediate consequence of isotony, and R1 follows from the timeslice
property. Property R2 follows from the covariance property (3) of the kinematic
net, which gives
ŒA.NI  .O1//; A.NI  .O2// D A. /.ŒA.MI O1/; A.MI O2//
(7)
and the required property holds because A. / is injective. In general, we will
describe any collection of boolean-valued functions PM W O.2/.M/ ! ftrue; falseg
obeying R1–R3 (with M varying over Loc) as rigid.

As a consequence, we see that the hypothesis that Einstein causality holds in
one spacetime is not independent of it holding in another. This is a prototype for the
spin–statistics connection that will be described later, and is similar to the arguments
used in [39]. Related arguments apply to properties such as extended locality (see
[29, 37] for the original deﬁnition) and the Schlieder property (see, likewise [36])
as described in [18].

Framed Spacetimes
The conventional account of theories with spin is phrased in terms of spin structures.
Four dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes support a unique spin bundle (up
to equivalence) namely the trivial right-principal bundle SM D M  SL.2; C/ [28]
and for simplicity we restrict to this situation. A spin structure  is a double cover
from SM to the frame bundle FM over M that intertwines the right-actions on SM
and FM: i.e.,  ı RS D R.S/ ı , where  W SL.2; C/ ! L"
C is the usual double
cover. Pairs .M; / form the objects of a category SpinLoc, in which a morphism
‰ W .M; / ! .M0; 0/ is a bundle morphism ‰ W SM ! SM0 which (a) covers
a Loc-morphism  W M ! M0, i.e., ‰.p; S/ D . .p/; „.p/S/ for some „ 2
C1.MI SL.2; C//, and (b) obeys 0 ı ‰ D   ı , where   is the induced map
of frame bundles arising from the tangent map of  . These structures provide the
setting for the locally covariant formulation of the Dirac ﬁeld [35], for instance.
From an operational perspective, however, this account of spin it is not completely
satisfactory, because the morphisms are described at the level of the spin bundle,
to which we do not have observational access, and are only ﬁxed up to sign by the
geometric map of spacetime manifolds. To some extent, one has also introduced the
understanding of spin by hand, as well, although this is reasonable enough when
formulating speciﬁc models such as the Dirac ﬁeld.
By contrast, the approach described here has a more operationally satisfactory
basis. Instead of Loc or SpinLoc, we work on a category of framed spacetimes FLoc
deﬁned as follows. An object of FLoc is a pair M D .M; e/ where M is a smooth
manifold of ﬁxed dimension n on which e D .e/n1
D0 is a global smooth coframe
(i.e., an n-tuple of smooth everywhere linearly independent 1-forms) subject to
the condition that M, equipped with the metric, orientation and time-orientation
induced by e, is a spacetime in Loc, to be denoted L.M; e/. Here, the metric
induced by e is 	e	e, where  D diag.C1; 1; : : : ; 1/, while the orientation

10
C.J. Fewster
and time-orientation are ﬁxed by requiring e0 ^    ^ en1 to be positively oriented,
and e0 to be future-directed. Similarly, a morphism  W .M; e/ ! .M0; e0/ in
FLoc is a smooth map between the underlying manifolds inducing a Loc-morphism
L.M; e/ ! L.M0; e0/ and obeying  e0 D e. In this way, we obtain a forgetful
functor L W FLoc ! Loc. Moreover, FLoc is related to SpinLoc by a functor
S W FLoc ! SpinLoc deﬁned by
S.M; e/ D .L.M; e/; .p; S/ 7! R.S/ej
p/;
(10)
where ej
p is the dual frame to e at p, and so that each FLoc morphism is mapped
to a SpinLoc-morphism S. / whose underlying bundle map is   idSL.2;C/.
Essentially, S.M; e/ corresponds to the trivial spin structure associated to a
frame [28], and we exploit the uniqueness of this spin structure to deﬁne the
morphisms. One may easily see that S is a bijection on objects; however, there
are morphisms in SpinLoc that do not have precursors in FLoc, namely, those
involving local frame rotations.5 Clearly, the composition of S with the obvious
forgetful functor from SpinLoc to Loc gives the functor L W FLoc ! Loc.
The description of spacetimes in Loc represents a ‘rods and clocks’ account
of measurement.6 However, we need to be clear that the coframe is not in itself
physically signiﬁcant, by contrast to the metric, orientation and time-orientation it
induces. In other words, our description contains redundant information and we
must take care to account for the degeneracies we have introduced. This is not
a bug, but a feature: it turns out to lead to an enhanced understanding of what
spin is.
In this new context, a locally covariant QFT should be a functor from FLoc to
Alg (or some other category, e.g., C-Alg). Of course, any theory A W Loc !
Alg induces such a functor, namely A ı L W FLoc ! Alg, and likewise every
B W SpinLoc ! Alg induces B ı S W FLoc ! Alg, but not every theory need
arise in this way. As already mentioned, we need to keep track of the redundancies
in our description, namely the freedom to make global frame rotations. These are
represented as follows. To each ƒ 2 L"
C, there is a functor T .ƒ/ W FLoc ! FLoc
T .ƒ/.M; e/ D .M; ƒe/;
where .ƒe/	 D ƒ	
e
.ƒ 2 L"

(11)
with action on morphisms uniquely ﬁxed so that L ı T .ƒ/ D L. In this way,
ƒ 7! T .ƒ/ faithfully represents L"
C in Aut.FLoc/. Moreover, any locally covariant
5Local frame rotations will appear later on, but not as morphisms.
6One might be concerned that the assumption that global coframes exist is restrictive, as it requires
that M to be parallelizable. However, this presents no difﬁculties if n D 4, because all four
dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes are parallelizable. Conceivably, one could modify the
set-up in general dimensions by working with local coframes, if it was felt necessary to include
non-parallelizable spacetimes.

(12)
which corresponds to applying the original theory A to a frame-rotated version of
the original spacetime. If we are to take seriously the idea that frame rotations of
this type carry no physical signiﬁcance then these theories should be equivalent. We
formalise this in the following
Axiom 4.1 (Independence of global frame rotations) To each ƒ 2 L"
C, there
exists an equivalence .ƒ/ W A
:! A ı T .ƒ/, such that
.ƒ/.M;e/˛.M;e/ D ˛.M;ƒe/.ƒ/.M;e/
.8˛ 2 Aut.A //:
(13)
The condition (13) asserts that the equivalence implementing independence of
global frame rotations intertwines the action of global gauge transformations.
Plausibly it might be relaxed (or modiﬁed) but it gives the cleanest results, so will be
maintained for now. Note that the equivalences .ƒ/ are not speciﬁed beyond this
requirement; what is important is that they exist. Obviously every theory induced
from Loc (i.e., A D B ı L, for some B W Loc ! Alg) obeys Axiom 4.1, simply by
taking .ƒ/ to be the identity automorphism of A.
The assumptions above have a number of consequences [10]. First, the .ƒ/
induce a 2-cocycle of L"
C, taking values in the centre of the global gauge group
Z.Aut.A //, and given by

.ƒ0; ƒ/.M;e/ D .ƒ/1
.M;e/.ƒ0/1
.M;ƒe/.ƒ0ƒ/.M;e/I
(14)
furthermore, any other system of equivalences e.ƒ/ W A
:! A ı T .ƒ/ obey-
ing (13) determines an equivalent 2-cocycle. We conclude that each theory A W
FLoc ! Alg obeying Axiom 4.1 determines a group cohomology class Œ
 2
H2.L"
CI Z.Aut.A /// in a canonical fashion.
It is worth pausing to consider some sufﬁcient conditions for Œ
 to be trivial.
This occurs, for instance, whenever A is induced from a theory on Loc, because
we may take .ƒ/ D idA, giving 
.ƒ; ƒ0/ D idA, and any other choice gives a
cohomologous 2-cocycle. Again, if A has global gauge group with trivial centre,
then 
 has no choice but to be trivial.
Next, the scalar ﬁelds of the theory form a vector space Fld.A / carrying an
action of both the gauge group

These two actions commute, and turn out to obey

(17)
which entails that irreducible subspaces of Fld.A / under the action of L"
CAut.A /
carry multiplier representations of L"
C, determined by 
. We deduce that the
scalar ﬁelds form Lorentz and gauge multiplets (extending a result on gauge
multiplets from [14]). Further, all multiplets in which the multiplier representation is
continuous (at least near the identity) must arise from true real linear representations
of the covering group SL.2; C/, and are therefore classiﬁed in the familiar way by
pairs .j; k/ where j; k are integer or half-integer spins. Accordingly our analysis has
led to an emergent understanding of spin, and answers the question of why this is
an appropriate physical notion in curved spacetimes.
In certain cases, we may say more immediately. Any theory induced from Loc,
or in which Z.Aut.A // is trivial, can only support ﬁelds of integer-spin, because Œ

is trivial. Similarly, all multiplets of observable ﬁelds are of integer spin, because 
is a global gauge transformation, and therefore acts trivially on such ﬁelds.
It seems remarkable that so much can be extracted from the single Axiom 4.1,
without the need to specify what the equivalences .ƒ/ actually are. In order to
prove the spin-statistics connection, however, it is convenient to be a bit more
speciﬁc, and to connect them to dynamics. This requires a generalization of the
spacetime deformation techniques to FLoc [10].
With this in mind, let us deﬁne FLoc-Cauchy morphisms to be FLoc morphisms
 whose image L. / in Loc is Cauchy according to our earlier deﬁnition. Further,
let us assume that A W FLoc ! Alg has the timeslice property and so maps any
FLoc-Cauchy morphism to an isomorphism in Alg. Fixing .M; e/ 2 FLoc, any eƒ 2
C1.MI L"
C/ that is trivial outside a time-compact set7 induces a relative Cauchy
evolution, illustrated in Fig. 4, and given by
rce.M;e/Œeƒ D A./ ı A.Œeƒ/1 ı A.CŒeƒ/ ı A.C/1:
(18)
However, it would seem strange if such a frame rotation could induce physical
effects in the overall evolution. Taking a more conservative stance, let us weaken
that to cover only those frame rotations that can be deformed away homotopically.
It seems reasonable to posit:
7That is, a set that lies to the future of one Cauchy surface and the past of another.

Spin and Statistics in Four Dimensions
We come to the proof of the spin–statistics connection [10]. As in [39], the idea
is to refer the statement in a general spacetime back to Minkowski space, where
standard spin–statistics results can be applied. In other words, we apply a rigidity
argument. The notion of statistics employed is based on graded commutativity of
local algebras at spacelike separation.
Deﬁnition 5.1 An involutory global gauge transformation  2 Aut.A /, 2 D id
is said to grade statistics in M if, for all spacelike separated regions Oi 2 O.M/,
every component of which has Cauchy surface topology R3, one has
A1A2 D .1/12A2A1
(26)
for all Ai 2 A kin.MI Oi/ s.t., MAi D .1/iAi.
The standard spin–statistics connection, in view of (25), asserts that .1/ grades
statistics in Minkowski space M0, where .S/ is deﬁned as in Sect. 4.
Theorem 5.2 If  grades statistics in M0, then it does so in every spacetime of
FLoc. Consequently, if the theory obeys the standard spin–statistics connection in
Minkowski space, .1/ grades statistics on every framed spacetime M 2 FLoc.
Proof (Sketch) For each hO1; O2i 2 O.2/.M/, let PM.O1; O2/ be the statement that
A1A2 D .1/12A2A1 for all Ai 2 A kin.MI Oi/ s.t., MAi D .1/iAi.
(27)
We argue that the collection .PM/M2FLoc is rigid, whereupon the result holds by a
generalization of Theorem 3.1 to FLoc. R1 and R3 hold for the same reasons used
in Sect. 3 for Einstein causality. For R2, we note that the subspaces
A kin
 .MI O/ D fA 2 A kin.MI O/ W MA D .1/Ag
 2 f0; 1g
(28)
obey, for any  W M ! f
M,
A kin
 .f
MI  .O// D A. /.A kin
 .MI O//
(29)
by naturality of  and injectivity of A. /. A further use of injectivity gives
Pe
M. .O1/;  .O2// ” PM.O1; O2/;
(30)
thus establishing R2 and concluding the proof.
What is really being proved is the connection between the statistics grading
in Minkowski space and that in arbitrary spacetimes. Thus, a locally covariant
theory that violates the standard spin-statistics connection in Minkowski space
(e.g., a ghost theory) but in which the statistics grading is still implemented (in

16
C.J. Fewster
Minkowski) by an involutory gauge transformation, would be covered by our result
– the statistics would be consistently graded in all spacetimes by the same gauge
transformation.

Summary and Outlook
The BFV paper [2] is subtitled ‘A new paradigm for local quantum physics’,
and indeed their paper marked the beginnings of a full development of a model-
independent account of QFT in CST, the current state of which is described in more
detail in [18]. At the heart of this approach is the fact that local covariance is a
surprisingly rigid structure, which makes it possible to transfer certain results from
the ﬂat spacetime situation into general curved spacetimes in a fairly systematic
way. This is a consequence of the timeslice property and also the structure of the
categories Loc and FLoc.
In this contribution, I have focussed particularly on the spin-statistics connection,
which was one of the starting points for the general theory. I have described a new
viewpoint, based on framed spacetimes, that gives a more operational starting point
for the discussion of spin in locally covariant QFT, without making reference to
unobservable geometric structures such as spin bundles. Instead, by recognizing that
we make physical measurements using frames, and by tracking the concomitant
redundancies, we are led naturally to a description that allows for spin. In our
discussion, the relative Cauchy evolution, which plays an important role in locally
covariant physics on Loc, is developed further so as to cater for deformation of the
framing, rather than just of the metric.
Certain issues remain to be understood. Our view of statistics has focussed
on graded commutativity at spacelike separation; it is not currently clear how
to make contact with the occurrence of braid statistics in low dimensions. The
coframed spacetimes we consider are necessarily parallelizable; while this is not
a restriction in four spacetime dimensions, one could seek generalizations that
accommodate nonparallelizable spacetimes of other dimensions. Finally, neither
the result described here, nor Verch’s result
[39], gives a direct proof of the
spin-statistics connection in curved spacetime; both rely on the classic results of
Minkowski space QFT. Now a proof is a proof, and perhaps one should not complain
too much, because it may be that a direct argument would be considerably more
involved than those we now have. Nonetheless, arguments that provide more insight
into the nature of the spin-statistics connection are still desirable and it is hoped that
the more operational account of spin presented here can be a further step along that
path.

Abstract We describe a functional renormalization group-based method to search
for ‘C-like’ functions with properties similar to that in 2D conformal ﬁeld theory.
It exploits the mode counting properties of the effective average action and is
particularly suited for theories including quantized gravity. The viability of the
approach is demonstrated explicitly in a truncation of 4 dimensional Quantum
Einstein Gravity, i.e. asymptotically safe metric gravity.

Introduction
A particularly intriguing result in 2-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory is Zamolod-
chikov’s c-theorem [1]. It states that every 2D Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory with
reﬂection positivity, rotational invariance, and a conserved energy momentum tensor
possesses a function C of its coupling constants, which is non-increasing along the
renormalization group trajectories and is stationary at ﬁxed points where it equals
the central charge of the corresponding conformal ﬁeld theory. After the advent of
this theorem many authors tried to ﬁnd a generalization that would be valid also
in dimensions greater than two [2–9]. This includes, for instance, suggestions by
Cardy [2] to integrate the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor hT	i
over a 4-sphere of unit radius, C /
R
S4 d4xpg hT	
	i, the work of Osborn [3],
and ideas based on the similarity of C to the thermodynamical free energy [4],
leading to a conjectural ‘F-theorem’ which states that, under certain conditions,
the ﬁnite part of the free energy of 3-dimensional ﬁeld theories on S3 decreases
along renormalization group (RG) trajectories and is stationary at criticality [5].
Cappelli, Friedan and Latorre [6] proposed to deﬁne a C-function on the basis of
the spectral representation of the 2-point function of the energy-momentum tensor.
While these investigations led to many important insights into the expected structure
of the hypothetical higher-dimensional C-function, the search was successful only
recently [10, 11] with the proof of the ‘a-theorem’ [2, 9]. According to the a-
theorem, the coefﬁcient of the Euler form term in the induced gravity action of a
4D theory in a curved, but classical, background spacetime is non-increasing along
RG-trajectories. Clearly theorems of this type are extremely valuable as they provide
non-perturbative information about quantum ﬁeld theories or statistical systems in
the strong coupling domain and constrain the structure of possible RG ﬂows.
In this article we are going to describe a functional RG-based search strategy by
means of which ‘C-like’ functions can possibly be identiﬁed under rather general
conditions, in particular in cases where the known c- and the a-theorems do not
apply. Our main motivation is in fact theories which include quantized gravity, in
particular those based upon the Asymptotic Safety construction [12–19].
According to this strategy, the ﬁrst step consists in trying to generalize the
‘counting property’ of Zamolodchikov’s C-function for a generic ﬁeld theory in
any number of dimensions: the sought-after function should roughly be equal to
(or at least in a known way be related to) the number of degrees of freedom that are
integrated out along the RG trajectory when the scale is lowered from the ultraviolet
(UV) towards the infrared (IR). Technically, we shall do this by introducing a higher-
derivative mode-suppression factor in the underlying functional integral which acts
as an IR cutoff. We can then take advantage of the well established framework of
the effective average action (EAA) to control the scale dependence [20], and to give
a well deﬁned meaning to the notion of a ‘number of modes’.
In a generic theory comprising a set of dynamical ﬁelds, ˆ, and associated
background ﬁelds, Nˆ, the EAA is a ‘running’ functional kŒˆ; Nˆ similar to the
standard effective action, but with a built-in IR cutoff at a variable mass scale

k. Its k-dependence is governed by an exact functional RG equation (FRGE). In
this article we shall argue that there exists a natural and ‘essentially universal’
map from k-dependent functionals k to functions Ck that are monotone along the
ﬂow and stationary at ﬁxed points. Here the term ‘universal’ is to indicate that we
would require only a few general properties to be satisﬁed, comparable to reﬂection
positivity, rotational invariance, etc. in the case of Zamolodchikov’s theorem. The
reason why we believe that there should exist such a map is that the respective
monotonicity properties of k and the C-function in 2D have essentially the same
simple origin. They both ‘count’ in a certain way the degrees of freedom (more
precisely: ﬂuctuation modes) that are already integrated out at a given RG scale
intermediate between the UV and the IR.
After a brief review of the necessary EAA apparatus, we shall present a promis-
ing candidate for a quantity with properties close to a C-function. It is obtained by
evaluating kŒˆ; Nˆ at a particularly chosen pair of k-dependent arguments .ˆ; Nˆ/,
namely ˆ D Nˆ  Nˆsc
k where Nˆsc
k is a self-consistent background ﬁeld. By deﬁnition,
Nˆ  Nˆsc
k is self-consistent (‘sc’) if the equation of motion for the dynamical ﬁeld
ˆ derived from k admits the solution ˆ D Nˆ. With other words, if the system is
put in a background which is self-consistent, the ﬂuctuations of the dynamical ﬁeld,
'  ˆ Nˆ, have zero expectation value and, in this sense, do not modify this special
background. As we shall see, in theories without fermions, Ck  kŒ Nˆsc
k ; Nˆsc
k 
has indeed a number of attractive properties making it almost a C-function. It is
stationary at ﬁxed points and it is monotonically decreasing along the ﬂow, at least
when split-symmetry is broken only sufﬁciently weakly.
The latter restriction is crucial and requires an explanation. In quantum gravity,
Background Independence is a central requirement [21] which, in the EAA frame-
work, is met by employing the background ﬁeld technique. At the intermediate
steps of the quantization one introduces a background spacetime, equipped with a
non-degenerate background metric in particular, but makes sure that no observable
prediction depends on it. This can be done by means of the Ward identities
pertaining to the split-symmetry [22–24] which governs the interrelation between
' and Nˆ. This symmetry, if intact, ensures that the physical contents of a theory is
independent of the chosen background structures. Usually, at the ‘off-shell’ level of
k, in particular when k > 0, the symmetry is broken by the gauge ﬁxing and cutoff
terms in the bare action. Insisting on unbroken split-symmetry in the physical sector
restricts the admissible RG trajectories which the EAA may follow [25, 26]; only
those which restore perfect split-symmetry at their end point (k D 0) are acceptable.
The ‘sufﬁciently weak split-symmetry breaking’ mentioned above is a related, but
not exactly the same requirement, namely that the amount of symmetry breaking,
on all scales k  0, does not exceed a certain bound (given by Eq. (36) below).
Speciﬁcally we shall apply these ideas within the Asymptotic Safety approach
to quantum gravity in the following [12–19]. The goal of the Asymptotic Safety
program is to precisely deﬁne, and then to actually compute functional integrals
over ‘all metrics’ such as
R
DOg eSŒOg	. The idea is to proceed indirectly and re-
construct the integral from a solution of the FRGE for the EAA. Contrary to the
functional integral, the FRGE is free from any UV singularities. The nontrivial issue

22
D. Becker and M. Reuter
then consists in ﬁnding an RG trajectory consisting of regular action functionals
fkŒ  g that is complete, i.e. has well deﬁned limits k ! 0 and k ! 1, respectively.
Asymptotic Safety is a property that ensures the existence of the UV limit, k ! 1.
Its prerequisite is a ﬁxed point of the RG ﬂow, . Let us assume there exists such
a ﬁxed point, and let SUV denote its UV critical manifold, that is the set of all
actions which are pulled into  under the inverse ﬂow (i.e. when going from the
IR to the UV). Then, for the k ! 1 limit to exist it is sufﬁcient (and probably also
necessary) to select any of the trajectories inside SUV; we can then be sure that it
has a singularity free UV behavior since it will always run into the ﬁxed point at
large scales and is easy to control then.
The only free choice in this entire construction concerns the theory space, T ,
i.e. the space of functionals on which the FRGE operates; in particular the ﬁelds
the functionals depend on, and their symmetries must be speciﬁed. Given T , the
form of the FRGE and so ultimately also its ﬁxed point properties are determined.
As k!1 is closely related to the bare action S, we are actually computing S
from the ﬁxed point condition, rather than putting it in ‘by hand’. Knowing 
and the RG ﬂow in its vicinity, and selecting an UV regularization scheme for the
functional integral, one can in principle compute how the bare parameters on which
this integral depends must be tuned in order to obtain a well deﬁned limit when its
UV regulator is removed, or the ‘continuum limit’ is taken [27]. For further details
on Asymptotic Safety and the status of the program we refer to the reviews [17–19].
The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we explain how the EAA
can be used in order to ‘count’ ﬁeld modes, and we identify a natural candidate
for a ‘C-function like’ quantity that exists in any number of dimensions. In Sect. 3
we apply these ideas to asymptotically safe metric gravity, or ‘Quantum Einstein
Gravity’ (QEG), and Sect. 4 contains the conclusions.
Our presentation follows Ref. [28] to which the reader is referred for additional
details.

From the EAA to the C-Function
We consider a general quantum ﬁeld theory on a d dimensional Euclidean space-
time, either rigid or ﬂuctuating, that is governed by a functional integral Z D
R
D Oˆ eSŒ Oˆ; Nˆ. The bare action S depends on a set of commuting and anticommuting
dynamical ﬁelds, Oˆ, and on a corresponding set of background ﬁelds, Nˆ. In a
Yang-Mills theory, Oˆ would contain both the gauge ﬁeld and the Faddeev-Popov
ghosts, and S includes gauge ﬁxing and ghost terms. Furthermore, the corresponding
background ﬁelds are part of Nˆ. As a rule, the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld O'  Oˆ Nˆ is always
required to gauge-transform homogeneously, i.e. like a matter ﬁeld. Henceforth we
regard O' rather than Oˆ as the true dynamical variable and interpret Z as an integral
over the ﬂuctuation variables: Z D
R
D O' exp

.

23
The set of background ﬁelds, Nˆ, always contains a classical spacetime metric
Ng	. In typical particle physics applications on a rigid spacetime one is not
interested in how Z depends on this background metric and usually sets Ng	 D ı	
throughout. Here in quantum gravity, where Background Independence is an issue,
one needs to know Z  ZŒNg	 for any background. In fact, employing the
background ﬁeld technique to implement Background Independence one represents
the dynamical metric as Og	 D Ng	 C Oh	 and requires invariance under split-
symmetry transformations

ıNg	 D "	; ıOh	 D "	

at the level of observable
quantities [25]. Assuming in the sequel that spacetime is dynamical, Og	 and Oh	
are special components of Oˆ and O', respectively.
Picking a basis in ﬁeld space, f'!g, we expand O'.x/ D P
! a! '!.x/, where
P
! stands for a summation and/or integration over all labels carried by the
basis elements. Then
R
D O' is interpreted as the integration over all possible
values that can be assumed by the expansion coefﬁcients a  fa!g. Thus, Z D

Let us assume that the '!’s are eigenfunctions of a certain differential operator,
L, which may depend on the background ﬁelds Nˆ, and which has properties similar
to the negative Laplace-Beltrami operator,  ND2. We suppose that L is built from
covariant derivatives involving Ng	 and the background Yang-Mills ﬁelds, if any, so
that it is covariant under spacetime diffeomorphism and gauge-transformations. We
assume an eigenvalue equation L'! D 2
!'! with positive spectral values 2
! >
0. The precise choice of L is arbitrary to a large extent. The only property of L
we need is that it should associate small (large) distances on the rigid spacetime
equipped with the metric Ng	 to large (small) values of 2
!. A ﬁrst (but for us not
the essential) consequence is that we can now easily install a UV cutoff by restricting
the ill-deﬁned inﬁnite product Q
! to only those !’s which satisfy ! < max. This
implements a UV cutoff at the mass scale max.
More importantly for our purposes, we also introduce a smooth IR cutoff at a
variable scale k 	 max into the integral, replacing it with

implements the IR cutoff. The extra piece in the bare action, Sk, is designed in such
a way that those '!-modes which have eigenvalues 2

 k2 get suppressed by a
small factor eSk 
 1 in Eq. (1), while eSk D 1 for the others. The function Rk
is essentially arbitrary, except for its interpolating behavior between Rk.2

The operator L deﬁnes the precise notion of ‘coarse graining’ ﬁeld conﬁgu-
rations. We regard the '!’s with ! > k as the ‘short wavelength’ modes, to
be integrated out ﬁrst, and those with small eigenvalues ! < k as the ‘long
wavelength’ ones whose impact on the ﬂuctuation’s dynamics is not yet taken into
account. This amounts to a diffeomorphism and gauge covariant generalization of
the standard Wilsonian renormalization group, based on standard Fourier analysis
on Rd, to situations with arbitrary background ﬁelds Nˆ D .Ng	; NA	;    /.
While helpful for the interpretation, it is often unnecessary to perform the
expansion of O'.x/ in terms of the L-eigenfunctions explicitly. Rather, one thinks
of (1) as a ‘basis independent’ functional integral
Zk D
Z
D0 O' eSŒ O'I NˆeSkŒ O'I Nˆ
(3)
for which the eigen-basis of L plays no special role, while the operator L as such
does so, of course. In particular the cutoff action Sk is now rewritten with 2
!
replaced by L in the argument of Rk:
SkŒ O'I Nˆ D 1

Z
ddx
p
Ng O'.x/ Rk.L/ O'.x/
(4)
Note that at least when k > 0 the modiﬁed partition function Zk depends on the
respective choices for L and Nˆ separately.
The family of k-dependent partition functions Zk enjoys a simple property which
is strikingly reminiscent of the C-theorem in 2 dimensions. Let us assume for
simplicity that all component ﬁelds constituting O' are commuting, and that Nˆ
has been chosen k-independent. Then (3) is a (regularized, and convergent for
appropriate S) purely bosonic integral with a positive integrand which, thanks to
the suppression factor eSk, decreases with increasing k. Therefore, Zk and the
‘entropy’ ln Zk, are monotonically decreasing functions of the scale:
@k ln Zk < 0
(5)
The interpretation of (5) is clear: Proceeding from the UV to the IR by lowering the
infrared cutoff scale, an increasing number of ﬁeld modes get un-suppressed, thus
contribute to the functional integral, and as a consequence the value of the partition
function increases. Thus, in a sense, ln Zk ‘counts’ the number of ﬁeld modes that
have been integrated out already. Before we can make this intuitive argument more
precise we must introduce a number of technical tools at this point.
Running actions Introducing a source term for the ﬂuctuation ﬁelds turns the
partition functions ZkŒJI Nˆ  eWkŒJI Nˆ into a generating functional:

with the solution to (7) inserted, J  JkŒ'I Nˆ. In the general case, k is the
Legendre-Fenchel transform of Wk, with Sk subtracted.
The EAA gives rise to a source-ﬁeld relationship which includes an explicit
cutoff term linear in the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld:

(9)
Here and in the following we write Rk

Rk.L/, and the notation RkŒ Nˆ
is used occasionally to emphasize that the cutoff operator may depend on the
background ﬁelds. The solution to (9), and more generally all ﬂuctuation corre-
lators h O'.x1/    O'.xn/i obtained by multiple differentiation of k, are functionally
dependent on the background, e.g. '.x/  'kŒJI Nˆ.x/. For the expectation value of
the full, i.e. un-decomposed ﬁeld Oˆ D Nˆ C O' we employ the notation ˆ D Nˆ C '
with ˆ  h Oˆi and '  h O'i. Using the complete ﬁeld ˆ instead of ' as the second
independent variable, accompanying Nˆ, entails the ‘bi-ﬁeld’ variant of the EAA,
kŒˆ; Nˆ  kŒ'I Nˆ
ˇˇ
'Dˆ Nˆ
(10)
which, in particular, is always ‘bi-metric’: kŒg	;    ; Ng	;    .
Organizing the terms contributing to kŒ'I Nˆ according to their level, i.e. their
degree of homogeneity in the '’s, we assume that the EAA admits a level expansion
of the form kŒ'I Nˆ D P1

Self-consistent backgrounds We are interested in how the dynamics of the
ﬂuctuations O' depends on the environment they are placed in, the background
metric Ng	, for instance, and the other classical ﬁelds collected in Nˆ. It would be
instructive to know if there exist special backgrounds in which the ﬂuctuations are
particularly ‘tame’ such that, for vanishing external source, they consists in at most
small oscillations about a stable equilibrium, with a vanishing mean: '  h O'i D 0.
Such distinguished backgrounds Nˆ  Nˆsc are referred to as self-consistent (sc)
since, if we prepare the system in one of those, the expectation value of the ﬁeld

26
D. Becker and M. Reuter
h Oˆi D ˆ D Nˆ does not get changed by violent O'-excitations that, generically, can
shift the point of equilibrium. From Eq. (9) we obtain the following condition Nˆsc
must satisfy (since J D 0 here by deﬁnition):
ı
ı'.x/kŒ'I Nˆ
ˇˇ
'D0; NˆD Nˆsc
k D 0
(11)
This is the tadpole equation from which we can compute the self-consistent
background conﬁgurations, if any. In general Nˆsc 
Nˆsc
k will have an explicit
dependence on k. A technically convenient feature of (11) is that it no longer
contains the somewhat disturbing Rk'-term that was present in the general ﬁeld
Eq. (9). Self-consistent backgrounds are equivalently characterized by Eq. (7),
ı
ıJ.x/WkŒJI Nˆ
ˇˇ
JD0; NˆD Nˆsc
k D 0
(12)
which again expresses the vanishing of the ﬂuctuation’s one-point function. Note
that provided the level expansion exists we may replace (11) with
ı
ı'.x/
L1
k Œ'I Nˆ
ˇˇ
'D0; NˆD Nˆsc
k D 0
(13)
which involves only the level-(1) functional L1
k . Later on in the applications this
trivial observation has the important consequence that self-consistent background
ﬁeld conﬁgurations Nˆsc
k .x/ can contain only running coupling constants of level
p D 1, that is, the couplings parameterizing the functional L1
k which is linear in '.
In our later discussions the value of the EAA at ' D 0 will be of special interest.
While it is still a rather complicated functional for a generic background where
kŒ0I Nˆ D WkŒJkŒ0I NˆI Nˆ, the source which is necessary to achieve ' D 0 for
self-consistent backgrounds is precisely J D 0, implying
kŒ0I Nˆsc

k Œ0I Nˆsc

k 
(14)
Here we also indicated that in a level expansion only the p D 0 term of k survives
putting ' D 0. Note that kŒ0I Nˆsc
k  can contain only couplings of the levels p D 0
and p D 1, respectively, the former entering via L0
k , the latter via Nˆ sc
k .
FIDE, FRGE, and WISS The EAA satisﬁes a number of important exact func-
tional equations which include a functional integro-differential equation (FIDE), the
functional RG equation (FRGE), the Ward identity for the Split-Symmetry (WISS),
and the BRS-Ward identity.
In full generality, the FIDE reads

Another exact relation satisﬁed by the EAA is the FRGE,

governs the ‘extra’ background dependence which it has over and above the one

gauge ﬁxing and ghost terms. Equation (17) is the Ward identity induced by the
split-symmetry transformations ı' D ", ı Nˆ D ", hence the abbreviation ‘WISS’.
First obtained in [22] for Yang-Mills theory, extensive use has been made of (17) in
quantum gravity [23] as a tool to assess the degree of split-symmetry breaking and
the reliability of certain truncations [24].
Pointwise monotonicity From the deﬁnition of the EAA by a Legendre transform
it follows that, for all Nˆ, the sum k C Sk is a convex functional of ', and that
.2/
k CRk is a strictly positive deﬁnite operator which can be inverted at all scales k 2
.0; 1/. Now let us suppose that the theory under consideration contains Grassmann-
even ﬁelds only. Then the supertrace in (16) amounts to the ordinary, and convergent
trace of a positive operator so that the FRGE implies
k@kkŒ'I Nˆ  0
at all ﬁxed '; Nˆ:
(18)
Thus, at least in this class of distinguished theories the EAA, evaluated at any ﬁxed
pair of arguments ' and Nˆ, is a monotonically increasing function of k. With other
words, lowering k from the UV towards the IR the value of kŒ'I Nˆ decreases
monotonically. We refer to this property as pointwise monotonicity in order to
emphasize that it applies at all points of ﬁeld space, .'; Nˆ/, separately.
In presence of ﬁelds with odd Grassmann parity, fermions and Faddeev-Popov
ghosts, the RHS of the FRGE is no longer obviously non-negative. However, if the

28
D. Becker and M. Reuter
only Grassmann-odd ﬁelds are ghosts the pointwise monotonicity (18) can still be
made a general property of the EAA, the reason being as follows. At least when
one implements the gauge ﬁxing condition strictly, it cuts-out a certain subspace of
the space of ﬁelds Oˆ to be integrated over, namely the gauge orbit space. Hereby the
integral over the ghosts represents the measure on this subspace, the Faddeev-Popov
determinant. The subspace and its geometrical structures are invariant under the RG
ﬂow, however. Hence the EAA pertaining to the manifestly Grassmann-even integral
over the subspace is of the kind considered above, and the argument implying (18)
should therefore be valid again. For a more detailed form of this argument we must
refer to [28]. From now on we shall make the explicit assumption, however, that the
sets ˆ and Nˆ do not contain fermions.
Monotonicity vs. stationarity The EAA evaluated at ﬁxed arguments shares the
monotonicity property with a C-function. However, kŒ'I Nˆ is not stationary at
ﬁxed points. In order to see why, and how to improve the situation, some care is
needed concerning the interplay of dimensionful and dimensionless variables, to
which we turn next.
(A) Let us assume that the space constituted by the functionals of ' and Nˆ admits
a basis fI˛g so that we can expand the EAA as
kŒ'I Nˆ D
X
˛
Nu˛.k/ I˛Œ'I Nˆ
(19)
with dimensionful running coupling constants Nu  .Nu˛/. They obey a FRGE in
component form, k@kNu˛.k/ D Nb˛.Nu.k/I k/, whereby the functions Nb˛ are deﬁned
by the expansion TrŒ    D P
˛ Nb˛.Nu.k/I k/ I˛Œ'I Nˆ.
(B) Denoting the canonical mass dimension1 of the running couplings by ŒNu˛ 
d˛, their dimensionless counterparts are deﬁned by u˛  kd˛ Nu˛. In terms of
the dimensionless couplings the expansion of k reads
kŒ'I Nˆ D
X
˛
u˛.k/kd˛I˛Œ'I Nˆ
(20)
Now observe that since k is dimensionless the basis elements have dimensions

I˛Œ'I Nˆ

D d˛. Purely by dimensional analysis, this implies that2
I˛ŒcŒ''I cŒ Nˆ Nˆ D cd˛I˛Œ'I Nˆ
for any constant c > 0.
(21)
1Our conventions are as follows. We use dimensionless coordinates, Œx	 D 0. Then Œds2 D 2
implies that all components of the various metrics have ŒOg	 D ŒNg	 D Œg	 D 2, and likewise
for the ﬂuctuations: ŒOh	 D Œh	 D 2.
2We use the notation cŒ''  fcŒ'i'ig for the set in which each ﬁeld is rescaled according to its
individual canonical dimension.

Is There a C-Function in 4D Quantum Einstein Gravity?
29
This relation expresses the fact that the nontrivial dimension of I˛ is entirely
due to that of its ﬁeld arguments; there are simply no other dimensionful
quantities available after the k-dependence has been separated off. Using (21)
for c D k1 yields the dimensionless monomials
kd˛I˛Œ'I Nˆ D I˛ŒkŒ''I kŒ Nˆ Nˆ  I˛Œ Q'I QNˆ
(22)
Here we introduced the sets of dimensionless ﬁelds,
Q'.x/  kŒ''.x/;
QNˆ.x/  kŒ Nˆ Nˆ.x/
(23)
which include, for instance, the dimensionless metric and its ﬂuctuations:
Qh	.x/  k2h	.x/;
QNg	.x/  k2Ng	.x/
(24)
Exploiting (22) in (20) we obtain the following representation of the EAA
which is entirely in terms of dimensionless quantities3 now:
kŒ'I Nˆ D
X
˛
u˛.k/ I˛Œ Q'I QNˆ  AkŒ Q'I QNˆ
(25)
Alternatively, one might wish to make its k-dependence explicit, writing,
kŒ'I Nˆ D
X
˛
u˛.k/ I˛ŒkŒ''I kŒ Nˆ Nˆ
(26)
In the second equality of (25) we introduced the new functional Ak which,
by deﬁnition, is numerically equal to k, but its natural arguments are the
dimensionless ﬁelds Q' and QNˆ. Hence the k-derivative of AkŒ Q'; QNˆ is to be
performed at ﬁxed . Q'; QNˆ/, while the analogous derivative of kŒ'I Nˆ refers
to ﬁxed dimensionful arguments:

(C) The dimensionless couplings u  .u˛/ can serve as local coordinates on theory
space,T . By deﬁnition, the ‘points’ of T are functionals A depending on
dimensionless arguments: AŒ Q'I QNˆ D P
˛ u˛ I˛Œ Q'I QNˆ. Geometrically speaking,
3Here one should also switch from k to the manifestly dimensionless ‘RG time’ t  ln.k/ C const,
but we shall not indicate this notationally.

The functions ˇ˛, components of a vector ﬁeld ˇ on T , are obtained by
translating k@kNu˛.k/ D Nb˛.Nu.k/I k/ into the dimensionless language. This leads
to the autonomous system of differential equations
k@ku˛.k/  ˇ˛.u.k// D d˛u˛.k/ C b˛.u.k//
(29)
Here b˛, contrary to its dimensionful precursor Nb˛, has no explicit k-depen-
dence, thus deﬁning an RG-time independent vector ﬁeld, the ‘RG ﬂow’
.T ; ˇ/.
If the ﬂow has a ﬁxed point at some u, i.e. ˇ˛.u/ D 0, the ‘velocity’
of any trajectory passing this point vanishes there, k@ku˛ D 0. Hence by (28)
the action Ak becomes stationary there, that is, its scale derivative vanishes
pointwise,
k@kAkŒ Q'I QNˆ D 0
for all ﬁxed Q'; QNˆ :

So the entire functional Ak approaches a limit, A D P

(31)
(D) This brings us back to the ‘defect’ of k we wanted to repair: While kŒ'I Nˆ
was explicitly seen to decrease monotonically along RG trajectories, it does
not come to a halt at ﬁxed points in general. The redeﬁned functional Ak,
instead, approaches a ﬁnite limit A at ﬁxed points, but is it monotone along
trajectories?
Unfortunately this is not the case, and the culprit is quite obvious, namely
the d˛u˛-terms present in the scale derivative of k, but absent for Ak. The
positivity of the RHS of Eq. (27b) does not imply the positivity of the RHS
of Eq. (27a), and there is no obvious structural reason for k@kAkŒ Q'I QNˆ  0
at ﬁxed Q', QNˆ. The best we can get is the following lower bound for the scale
derivative: k@kAkŒ Q'I QNˆ   P
˛ d˛u˛.k/ I˛Œ Q'I QNˆ.
The proposal The complementary virtues of Ak and k with respect to monotonic-
ity along trajectories and stationarity at critical points suggest the following strategy
for ﬁnding a C-type function with better properties: Rather than considering the
functionals pointwise, i.e. with ﬁxed conﬁgurations of either the dimensionless or

31
dimensionful ﬁelds inserted, one should evaluate them at explicitly scale dependent
arguments: Ck
‹D kŒ'kI Nˆk  AkŒ Q'kI QNˆk. The hope is that 'k  kŒ' Q'k, and
Nˆk  kŒ Nˆ QNˆk can be given a k-dependence which is intermediate between the two
extreme cases .'; Nˆ/ D const and . Q'; QNˆ/ D const, respectively, so as to preserve as
much as possible of the monotonicity properties of k, while rendering Ck stationary
at ﬁxed points of the RG ﬂow.
The most promising candidate which we could ﬁnd so far is
Ck D kŒ0I Nˆsc
k  D AkŒ0I QNˆ sc
k 
(32)
Here the ﬂuctuation argument is set to zero, 'k  0, and for the background
we choose a self-consistent one, Nˆsc
k , a solution to the tadpole equation (11), or
equivalently its dimensionless variant
ı
ı Q'.x/AkŒ Q'I QNˆ
ˇˇ
Q'D0; QNˆD QNˆsc
k D 0
(33)
The function k 7! Ck deﬁned by Eq. (32) has a number of interesting properties
to which we turn next.
(i) Stationarity at critical points. When the RG trajectory approaches a ﬁxed
point, AkŒ Q'I QNˆ approaches AŒ Q'I QNˆ pointwise. Furthermore, the tadpole
equation (33) becomes .ıA=ı Q'/Œ0I QNˆ D 0. It is k-independent, and so is
its solution, QNˆ. Thus Ck approaches a well deﬁned, ﬁnite constant:
Ck
FP
! C D AŒ0I QNˆ
(34)
Of course we can write this number also as C D kŒ0I kŒ Nˆ QNˆ wherein the
explicit and the implicit scale dependence of the EAA cancel exactly when a
ﬁxed point is approached.
(ii) Stationarity at classicality. In a classical regime (‘CR’), by deﬁnition, Nb˛ !
0, so that the dimensionful couplings stop running: Nu˛.k/ ! NuCR
˛
D const.
Thus, by (19), k approaches CR D P
˛ NuCR
˛ I˛ pointwise. Hence the dimen-
sionful version of the tadpole equation, (11), becomes k-independent, and the
same is true for its solution, Nˆsc
CR. So, when the RG trajectory approaches a
classical regime, Ck asymptotes a constant:
Ck
CR
! CCR D CRŒ0I Nˆsc
CR
(35)
Alternatively we can write CCR D AkŒ0I kŒ Nˆ Nˆsc
CR where it is now the explicit
and implicit k-dependence of Ak which cancel mutually.
We observe that there is a certain analogy between ‘criticality’ and ‘classi-
cality’, in the sense that dimensionful and dimensionless couplings exchange

32
D. Becker and M. Reuter
their roles. The difference is that the former situation is related to special points
of theory space, while the latter concerns extended regions in T . In those
regions, Ak keeps moving as AkŒ   D P
˛ NuCR
˛ kd˛ I˛Œ  . Nevertheless it is
natural, and of particular interest in quantum gravity, to apply a (putative) C-
function not only to crossover trajectories in the usual sense which connect
two ﬁxed points, but also to generalized crossover transitions where one of the
ﬁxed points is replaced by a classical regime.
(iii) Monotonicity at exact split-symmetry. If split-symmetry is exact in the sense
that kŒ'I Nˆ depends on the single independent ﬁeld variable Nˆ C '  ˆ
only, and the theory is one of those for which pointwise monotonicity (18)
holds true, then k 7! Ck is a monotonically increasing function of k. In fact,
differentiating (32) and using the chain rule yields
@kCk D .@kk/ Œ0I Nˆsc
k  C
Z
ddx @k Nˆsc
k .x/  ık
ı Nˆ.x/  ık
ı'.x/
ˇˇˇˇ
'D0; NˆD Nˆsc
k
(36)
In the ﬁrst term on the RHS of (36) the derivative @k hits only the explicit
k-dependence of the EAA. By Eq. (18) we know that this contribution is non-
negative. The last term, the ı=ı'-derivative, is actually zero by the tadpole
equation (11). Including it here it becomes manifest that the integral term
in (36) vanishes when k depends on ' and Nˆ only via the combination ' C Nˆ.
Thus we have shown that
@kCk  0
at exact split-symmetry
(37)
This is already close to what one should prove in order to establish Ck as a
‘C-function’. In particular in theories that require no breaking of split-symmetry
the integral term in (36) is identically zero and we know that @kCk  0 holds true.
Whether or not @kCk is really non-negative for all k depends on the size of
the split-symmetry breaking the EAA suffers from. To prove monotonicity of Ck
one would have to show on a case-by-case basis that the second term on the
RHS of (36) never can override the ﬁrst one, known to be non-negative, so as to
render their sum negative. In the next section we shall perform this analysis in a
truncation of Quantum Einstein Gravity, but by working directly with the deﬁnition
Ck D kŒ0I Nˆsc
k  instead of Eq. (36).
Relating Ck to a spectral density Under special conditions, the EAA can be shown
to literally ‘count’ ﬁeld modes. For a sharp cutoff, and if L  .2/
k Œ0I Nˆsc
k  is such
that it can be used as the cutoff operator, a formal calculation based upon the exact
FRGE yields for the scale derivative of our candidate C-function:

k2  .2/
k Œ0I Nˆsc

(38)

Is There a C-Function in 4D Quantum Einstein Gravity?
33
This is exactly the spectral density of the Hessian operator, for the sc-background
and vanishing ﬂuctuations, a manifestly non-decreasing function of k. If the k-
dependence of .2/
k
is negligible relative to k2, Eq. (38) is easily integrated:

Thus, at least under the special conditions described and when the spectrum is
discrete, Ck indeed counts ﬁeld modes in the literal sense of the word.
Regardless of the present approximation we deﬁne in general
Nk1;k2  Ck2  Ck1
(40)
Then, in the cases when the above assumptions apply and (39) is valid, Nk1;k2 has a
simple interpretation: it equals the number of eigenvalues between k2
1 and k2
2 > k2
1
of the Hessian operator .2/
k Œ0I Nˆsc
k . When the assumptions leading to (39) are not
satisﬁed, the interpretation of Nk1;k2, and Ck in the ﬁrst place, is less intuitive, but
these quantities are well deﬁned nevertheless.

Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity
Next, we test the above Ck-candidate and apply it to Quantum Einstein Gravity, a
theory which is asymptotically safe most probably, that is, all physically relevant RG
trajectories start out in the UV, for k ‘D’ 1, at a point inﬁnitesimally close to a non-
Gaussian ﬁxed point of the ﬂow generated by the FRGE (16). When k is lowered, the
trajectories run towards the IR, always staying within the ﬁxed point’s UV critical
manifold, and ultimately approach the (dimensionless) ordinary effective action.
Dealing with pure metric gravity here we identify ˆ  .g	;    /, Nˆ 
.Ng	;    /, and '  .h	;    / as the dynamical, background, and ﬂuctuation ﬁelds,
respectively, where the dots stand for the entries due to the Faddeev-Popov ghosts.
To make the analysis technically feasible we are going to truncate the corresponding
theory space. Following Ref. [28] we focus here on the so-called bi-metric Einstein-
Hilbert truncation. The corresponding ansatz for the EAA has the structure k D
grav
k
Œg; Ng C    where the dots represent gauge ﬁxing and ghost terms which are
taken to be k-independent and of classical form. The diffeomorphically invariant
part of the action, grav

the dynamical metric, g	, and its background analog, Ng	, respectively:

and only one Einstein-Hilbert term is retained in grav

term the two metrics appear independently.)

point (NGFP). A 2-dimensional projection of the RG ﬂow onto the gDyn-Dyn-plane
is shown in Fig. 1. It is strikingly similar to the well known phase portrait of the
corresponding single-metric truncation [16]. In this projection we can identify the
same familiar classes of trajectories, namely those of type Ia, IIa, or IIIa, depending
on whether the cosmological constant approaches 1, 0, or C1 in the IR. The
type IIIa trajectories display a generalized crossover transition which connects a
ﬁxed point in the UV to a classical regime in the IR. The latter is located on the
trajectory’s lower, almost horizontal branch where g; 

arises when all metrics Ngsc

the delicate issue of a topological change. This situation is realized, for example, if

the level-(1) cosmological constant is positive on all scales, as it is indeed the case
along the type (IIIa) trajectories: ƒ.1/

In the following we focus on this case, and we also specialize for d D 4. The
requirement of a ﬁnite volume is then met by a well studied class of Einstein spaces
which exist for an arbitrary positive value of the cosmological constant, namely
certain 4-dimensional gravitational instantons, such as Euclidean de Sitter space,
S4, the Page metric, the product space S2  S2, or the Fubini-Study metric on the
projective space P2.C/ [31]. If Vg	 is one of these instanton metrics for some

Numerical results In [25] the type IIIa trajectories on g.0/; .0/; g.1/; .1/-theory
space were analyzed in detail. In [28] representative examples were computed
numerically, and then Ck was evaluated along these trajectories. Concerning the
monotonicity of Ck, the results can be summarized as follows.
The set of RG trajectories that are asymptotically safe, i.e. originate in the
UV at (or, more precisely, inﬁnitesimally close to) the NGFP consists of two
fundamentally different classes, namely those that are ‘physical’ and restore split-
symmetry at their end point k D 0, and those which do not. (Within the present
truncation, and according to the lowest order of the WISS, Eq. (17), intact split-
symmetry amounts to g.0/
k
D g.1/
k
and .0/
k
D .1/
k .) Along all trajectories that do
restore split-symmetry, Ck was found to be perfectly monotone, and stationary both
at the NGFP and in the classical regime. Unphysical trajectories, not restoring split-
symmetry in the IR, on the other hand, can give rise to a non-monotone behavior of
Ck.
A similar analysis was performed on the basis of the single-metric version of
the Einstein-Hilbert truncation with a 2 dimensional theory space. It is less precise
than its bi-metric counterpart as it hypothesizes perfect split-symmetry on all scales,
something that can be true at best approximately because of the various unavoidable
sources of symmetry breaking in the EAA (cutoff action Sk, gauge ﬁxing term).
Regarding the monotonicity of Ck, we found that Ck fails to be monotone for
any of the single-metric type IIIa trajectories. The detailed analysis revealed that
this failure is due to the (not quite unexpected) insufﬁciency of the single-metric
approximation, rather than to a structural defect of the candidate Ck D kŒ0I Nˆsc
k .
For a typical RG trajectory, both the single- and bi-metric Ck-functions are depicted
in Fig. 2.
The numerical results [28] lend strong support to the following
Conjecture: In the full theory, QEG in 4 dimensions, or in a sufﬁciently general
truncation thereof, the proposed candidate for a ‘C-like’ function is a monotonically
increasing function of k along all RG trajectories that restore split-symmetry in the
IR and thus comply with the fundamental requirement of Background Independence.
Crossover trajectories and entropy of de Sitter space The function Ck for
truncated QEG is stationary at ﬁxed points as well as in classical regimes. This
is obvious from the following two alternative representations of the reduced

We see that Yk, and hence Ck becomes stationary when the dimensionless couplings
are at a ﬁxed point of the ﬂow, and also when the dimensionful ones become scale
independent; this is the case in a classical regime (‘CR’) where, by deﬁnition,
no physical RG effects occur. If ƒI
CR and GI
CR denote the constant values of
the cosmological and Newton constants there, this regime amounts to the trivial
canonical scaling I

CR.
As a result, there exists the possibility of generalized crossover transitions, not
in the standard way from one ﬁxed point to another, but rather from a ﬁxed point
to a classical regime or vice versa. Thereby Ck will always approach well deﬁned
stationary values C and CCR in the respective ﬁxed point or classical regime.
In quantum gravity, the investigations of such generalized crossover transitions
is particularly important since one of its main tasks consists in explaining the
emergence of a classical spacetime from the quantum regime.
Specializing again for an asymptotically safe type IIIa trajectory, the initial point
in the UV is a non-Gaussian ﬁxed point. For the limit C UV  limk!1 Ck the bi-
metric calculation yields C UV D C, with

According to the Einstein-Hilbert results for the NGFP, C=V.M; Vg/ is a positive
number of order unity, presumably between about 4 and 8. Concerning the opposite
limit C IR D limk!0 Ck, the trajectory describes a generalized crossover, enters a
classical regime, and restores split-symmetry for k ! 0. This entails C IR D CCR

(48)
Here we exploited that split-symmetry implies the values of GCR and ƒCR to be
level independent.
We may conclude that in an asymptotically safe theory of quantum gravity
which is built upon a generalized crossover trajectory from criticality (the NGFP)
to classicality the Ck-function candidate implies the ‘integrated C-theorem’ N 
N0;1 D C UV  C IR with ﬁnite numbers C UV, C IR, and N.
This ﬁniteness is in marked contrast to what standard perturbative ﬁeld theory
would predict. Clearly, the Asymptotic Safety of QEG is the essential prerequisite
for this property since it is the non-Gaussian ﬁxed point that assigns a well deﬁned,
computable value to C UV.
The quantity N can be interpreted as a measure for the ‘number of modes’ which
are integrated out while the cutoff is lowered from inﬁnity to k D 0. The notion
of ‘counting’ and the precise meaning of a ‘number of ﬁeld modes’ is deﬁned by
the EAA itself, namely via the identiﬁcation Ck D kŒ Nˆsc
k ; Nˆ sc
k . We saw in the
previous section that, under special conditions, Ck is literally counting the .2/
k -
eigenvalues in a given interval. However, generically we are dealing with a non-
trivial generalization thereof which, strictly speaking, amounts to a deﬁnition of
‘counting’. As such it is probably the most natural one from the perspective of the
EAA and the geometry of theory space.
Let us consider a simple caricature of the real Universe, namely a family of
de Sitter spaces along a type IIIa trajectory, whose classical regime in the IR has
ƒCR > 0. Assuming it represents the real ﬁnal state of the evolution, we have
C IR D 3=GCRƒCR < 0. Note that jC IRj equals precisely the well known semi-
classical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space.
If in particular GCRƒCR 
 1, corresponding to a very ‘large’ classical Universe,
we have jC IRj  1, while jCUVj D O.1/ is invariably determined by the NGFP
coordinates. As a consequence, the number N is completely dominated by the IR
part of the trajectory:
N D C UV  C IR  C IR  C
3
GCRƒCR
 1
(49)
Identifying ƒCR and GCR with the corresponding values measured in the real
Universe we would ﬁnd N  10120.
Thus, in the sense explained above, the familiar Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of
de Sitter space acquires a rather concrete interpretation, namely as the number of
metric and ghost ﬂuctuation modes that are integrated out between the NGFP in the
UV and the classical regime in the IR. It plays a role analogous to the central charge
of the IR conformal ﬁeld theory in Zamolodchikov’s case.

Is There a C-Function in 4D Quantum Einstein Gravity?
39
Beside monotonicity and stationarity, Ck has another essential property in com-
mon with a C-function: The limiting value C has a genuine inherent interpretation
at the ﬁxed point itself. It is a number characteristic of the NGFP which does not
depend on the direction it is approached, and in this role it is analogous to the central
charge. The interpretation of C is best known for the single-metric approximation
.g.0/  g.1/; .0/  .1// where, apart from inessential constants, it is precisely
the inverse of the dimensionless combination g D Gk!1ƒk!1. Its physical
interpretation is that of an ‘intrinsic’ measure for the size of the cosmological
constant at the ﬁxed point, namely the limit of the running cosmological constant
in units of the running Planck mass (G1=2
k
). In numerous single-metric studies the
product g has been investigated, and it was always found that g is a universal
quantity, i.e. it is independent of the cutoff scheme and the gauge ﬁxing, within
the accuracy permitted by the approximation. In fact, typically the universality
properties of g were even much better than those of the critical exponents.
Completely analogous remarks apply to the bi-metric generalization.
Concerning the ﬁniteness of N, the situation changes fundamentally if we try
to deﬁne the function k 7! Ck along trajectories of the type Ia, those heading for a
negative cosmological constant Dyn after leaving the NGFP regime, and of type IIa,
the single trajectory which crosses over from the NGFP to the Gaussian ﬁxed point.
For all type Ia trajectories, Ck becomes singular at some nonzero scale ksing > 0
when they pass Dyn D 0: As Eq. (45) shows, Y.  / and C.  / have a pole there so
that Ck diverges in the limit k & ksing. The number Nksing;1 is inﬁnite then, even
though not all modes are integrated out yet. There is a non-trivial RG evolution also
between ksing and k D 0. The tadpole equation has qualitatively different solutions
for k > ksing, k D ksing, and k < ksing, namely spherical, ﬂat, and hyperbolic spaces,
respectively (Sd, Rd, and Hd, say). This topology change prevents us from smoothly
continuing the mode count across the Dyn D 0 plane. This is the reason why we
mostly focused on type IIIa trajectories here.

Summary
The effective average action is a variant of the standard effective action which has
an IR cutoff built in at a sliding scale k. At least for systems without fermions it
possesses a natural mode counting and (‘pointwise’) monotonicity property which
is strongly reminiscent of, but actually not equivalent to, Zamolodchikov’s C-
function in 2 dimensions. Motivated by this observation, and taking advantage of the
structures and tools that are naturally provided by the manifestly non-perturbative
EAA framework, we tried to ﬁnd a map from the functional kŒˆ; Nˆ to a single
real valued function Ck that shares two main properties with the C-function in 2
dimensions, namely monotonicity along RG trajectories and stationarity at RG ﬁxed
points. Such a map is unlikely to exist in full generality. In fact, an essential part
of the research program we are proposing consists in ﬁnding suitable restrictions

on, or specializations of the admissible trajectories (restoring split-, or other
symmetries, etc.), the theory space (with respect to ﬁeld contents and symmetries),
the underlying space of ﬁelds (boundary conditions, regularity requirements, etc.),
and the coarse graining methodology (choice of cutoff, treatment of gauge modes,
etc.) that will guarantee its existence. We motivated a speciﬁc candidate for a map
of this kind, namely Ck D kŒ Nˆsc
k ; Nˆsc
k  where Nˆsc
k is a running self-consistent
background, a solution to the tadpole equation implied by k. This function Ck is
stationary at ﬁxed points, and a non-decreasing function of k provided the breaking
of the split-symmetry which relates ﬂuctuation ﬁelds and backgroundsis sufﬁciently
weak. Thus, for a concrete system the task is to identify the precise conditions under
which the split-symmetry violation does not destroy the monotonicity property of
Ck, and to give a corresponding proof then.
By means of a particularly relevant example, asymptotically safe QEG in 4
dimensions, we demonstrated that this strategy is viable in principle and can indeed
lead to interesting candidates for ‘C-like’ functions under conditions which are not
covered by the known c- and a-theorems. Within a sufﬁciently precise truncation of
QEG, on a 4 dimensional theory space, we showed that Ck has exactly the desired
properties of monotonicity and stationarity, provided it is based upon a physically
meaningful RG trajectory, that is, one which leads to a restoration of Background-
Independence once all ﬁeld modes are integrated out.

Introduction
Ultraviolet divergent amplitudes of Feynman diagrams in x-space are given by
functional expressions too singular at short distances to deﬁne distributions on all
of space(-time). Quite often, however, they can be represented on their domain of
deﬁnition as derivatives of bona ﬁde distributions, and so extended to the whole
space. “Differential renormalization” (DiffRen for short) in this sense does not need
previous regularization steps. It was introduced by Freedman, Johnson and Latorre
in a path-breaking article [1].
While that reference is a true tour de force, showing the calculational power of
the method (and of its authors), it did not attempt to disentangle the combinatorics
of successive renormalizations for non-primitive graphs in a systematic way. This
task was taken up in later work in differential renormalization [2].
Differential renormalization remained popular during the nineties, to peter out
in the third millennium. Now, a spate of papers [3–5] have recently dealt with
renormalization in x-space in the spirit of the classic article by Epstein and
Glaser [6], whose kinship with DiffRen is evident. Each of those solves the
renormalization recursion in its own way. Among them, reference [4] adheres to
DiffRen closely and improves it. Our aim here is to pedagogically revisit from its
viewpoint the combinatorics of the “subtraction” of subdivergences in [2] as well,
comparing methods and (hopefully) bringing improvement again.
As in the last-mentioned paper, for simplicity we deal mostly with the Euclidean
massless 4
4 model.
2
The Importance of Degree
We start by a point of rigour, that some readers may wish to skip. Naturally the
ﬁrst step in [2] is to determine whether a given graph needs renormalization. The
answer they give, in view of Weinberg’s “power counting” theorem [7, 8], is to
ﬁnd the superﬁcial degree of each generalized vertex (subgraph) in the graph. Now,
that theorem yields a sufﬁcient condition for renormalizability. While the question
of improving on it is moot for scalar models, experience with renormalization
of massless graphs suggests a less restrictive criterion. To wit, extension of log-
homogeneous graphs in the sense of [3, 4] produces log-homogeneous graphs of
the same order and higher degree. Whenever the extension can be made to a log-
homogeneous graph of the same degree, we understand that we deal with a matter
of (re)deﬁnition, the diagram is convergent, and no renormalization has taken place.
The subject is discussed in [3], but we deem it worthwhile to bring it here for
completeness in our review of [2]. We show a truly trivial example in the Minkowski
space M4. The distribution ı.x2/ appears routinely in formulas for the propagators
of free massless ﬁelds. However, its meaning is not altogether obvious. Given any
distribution f on R, one is able to deﬁne pullback distributions f.P/ on smooth
hypersurfaces P (codimension 1 submanifolds) of M4; in particular one deﬁnes ı.P/.

Differential versus Improved Epstein-Glaser Renormalization

However the lightcone x2 D 0 is not smooth at the origin, where grad x2 vanishes.
Thus prima facie ı.x2/ is deﬁned on M4 n f0g only—as a homogeneous distribution
of order 2. Consider, however, for small positive ", the distributions:
hı˙.x2  "/; i D

where the integrals are respectively concentrated on the upper and lower sheet of
the hyperboloid f x W x2 D " g, and 	" is a Leray form such that dx2 ^ 	" D d4x.

are obviously well deﬁned, and they extend the previous ı.x2/.
The extension of ı.x2/ of course is not unique; but crucially the one just deﬁned
preserves Lorentz symmetry and keeps the same degree of homogeneity: we then
reckon that no “renormalization” has taken place.1
A more sophisticated example is found in [3, Sect. 5]. The propagator of the free
electromagnetic ﬁeld is the quotient of a harmonic polynomial of degree 2 by the
third power of x2, and thus is logarithmically divergent by power counting. However,
it does possess an homogeneous extension, therefore it is convergent in our more
precise sense. The example offers little doubt, since, as is well known, it boils down
to second derivatives of the massless propagator [9].
3
Dealing with a Three-Point Problem
Let us continue by pointing to another difference between DiffRen as practiced
in [1, 2] and the (improved) Epstein–Glaser method [10]. In the former papers one
ﬁnds an extension for the “ﬁsh” graph of the 4
4 model, with vertices .0; x/:

the usual derivation rules, the expression ı0.x2/ on M4 is meaningless.

in the understanding that l D 1=M, where M is their mass scale; while, as explained

because x2RxŒx4

x2, while x2rxŒx4 fails to reproduce the convergent
amplitude x2. The algebra property of [10] generalizes throughout into the “causal
factorization property” of [3], which is the basis for a streamlined proof of the
recursive renormalization of subdivergences.
Now, our lodestone to deal with recursive renormalization in [4] was a rule
contained in the very illuminating paper [11]. It is written:
hRŒ; 'i D hRŒ; .=/ 'i:
(2)
In this formula any subgraph  of a given graph  is identiﬁed as a subset of the set
of vertices of  and the set of all lines joining any two elements of this subset.
There RŒ, RŒ and = denote amplitudes, respectively for the renormalized
graph and subgraph, and the bare cograph =; the test function ' is supported
outside the singular points of the latter. The rule works as a necessary and sufﬁcient
prescription: the RŒ are supposed known, and then RŒ must conform to the
formula above. It subsumes (the Euclidean version of) the causal factorization
property, which allowed a streamlined proof of recursive renormalization in [3], but
would be awkward in actual computation. Later we will show how rule (2) works
when there are internal vertices in , by means of an interesting six-loop diagram
considered in [2].
In [2], on the other hand, it is claimed that recursive renormalization is effected
by use of Bogoliubov’s subtraction operators [12, Ch. 29]; another good reference
for this method is [8]. For instance, according to them, the bare graph x4, with
vertices .x; 0/, is renormalized by
rx;0Œx4 D .I  Tx;0/x4
with
Tx;0 x4 WD x4 

:
Actually Tx;0 x4 as written above makes no sense, since if we compare both its
summands on the intersection of their natural domains we obtain zero. But it is
obvious how to get rid notationally of this ugly contortion, which makes violence to
DiffRen.
Let us start in earnest by considering, as the authors in that paper do, the example
of the winecup graph or ice-cream ladder graph, devoid of internal vertices:

Differential versus Improved Epstein-Glaser Renormalization

(In order to get closer to the notation in [2], we have exchanged vertices x and 0 in
the formulae in [4].) We denote it
.x; y/ for future use. The corresponding bare
amplitude is given by
f.x; y/ D
1
x2y2.x  y/4 :
Both papers [1] and [4] consider a “partially renormalized” version of the
winecup graph, for which the known formulas respectively yield:


C 2x4 ı.x  y/:
The last expressions indeed make sense for all .x; y/ ¤ .0; 0/.
The ﬁrst term on the right hand sides above is the one given in [2, Eq. 2.15].
Extension of the last term, not present there, to the thin diagonal (i.e., the whole
graph), clearly is no problem. So we concentrate in extending the ﬁrst: each of the
factors in rx;y

x2y2.x  y/4
is a well-deﬁned distribution, but their product is
not.
The tactic followed in [1, 4] is to invoke Green’s integration-by-parts formula
to shift the Laplacian to the left and use the fundamental solution for it. Paper [2]
purports instead to deal with the overall divergence “as a three-point problem”. Their
claim is ﬁrstly that the whole graph is renormalized by
.I  Tx;y;0/.I  Tx;0/x2y2.x  y/4:
Secondly, that the handy and correct formula
A.B/ D .A/B C @ˇ.A@ˇB  B@ˇA/;
(4)
employed in [1] and borrowed by [4], is not to be used, on the grounds that such
a trick reverts to a two-point problem, while they want to grapple directly with the
three-point problem. Thirdly, that the singular behaviors of rx;y

x2y2.x  y/4
and of 22 ı.y/ x4 log jxj=l are the same.
Again, the mathematical argument there given for all that is hard to bear.
However, the last assertion is correct, and it can be made sense of as follows. Note
that

The second integral is ﬁnite, and the ﬁrst one is proportional to

In practice we are back to the two-point problem. A similar argument works
whenever the graph has been rendered “primitive” by partial renormalization. The

with the contention that, although neither of the ﬁrst two terms in the last expression
exists strictu sensu, their combination is a well-deﬁned distribution. The situation
is then clariﬁed by use of (4) nevertheless, whereby the second term in the above
display completely drops out, and we are left with the third one plus a well-deﬁned
divergence—in the sense of vector calculus, see right below.

More General Procedures
It is plausibly claimed in [2] that more complicated graphs can be tackled by the
systematics of the Bogoliubov recursion, or its descendant the . That is,

where the sum is over the partitions of  into divergent generalized vertices v, and
Q prop denotes the product of propagators corresponding to all lines which connect
the different elements of the partition.
The notational contortions above are again clear, but we do not take issue with
them; rather we hasten to revisit a deﬁnitely amusing example. We ponder the six-
loop graph  obtained when one “stye” develops on each of the single propagators

Conclusion
Formulae (5) and (6) work like guiding principles, rather than calculational recipes.
Actual production of closed formulas relies on a bag of tricks. While the application
of the inductive principle of [4] often proﬁts from similar tricks, it appears to be
better adapted in practice to deal with complex diagrams.

Abstract Usually, the Lagrangian of a model for massive vector bosons is derived
in a geometric way by the Higgs mechanism. We investigate whether this geometric
structure is maintained under the renormalization group (RG) ﬂow. Using the
framework of Epstein-Glaser renormalization, we ﬁnd that the answer is ‘no’, if
the renormalization mass scale(s) are chosen in a way corresponding to the minimal
subtraction scheme. This result is derived for the U.1/-Higgs model to 1-loop order.
On the other hand we give a model-independent proof that physical consistency,
which is a weak form of BRST-invariance of the time-ordered products, is stable
under the RG-ﬂow.

Introduction
By the renormalization group (RG) ﬂow we have a tool to describe a QFT-model
at different scales. In this description, the basic ﬁelds, the gauge-ﬁxing parameter,
the masses and the prefactors of the various interaction terms are scale-dependent
quantities.
On the other hand, the derivation of the Lagrangian of a model for massive
vector bosons by the Higgs mechanism, i.e. by spontaneous symmetry breaking
of a gauge theory, implies that the prefactors of the various interaction terms are
uniquely determined functions of the coupling constant(s) and masses.
Do these functions remain unchanged under the RG-ﬂow, i.e. under an arbitrary
change of scale? This question is a reformulation of the title of this paper. Since
the non-trivial contributions to the RG-ﬂow come from loop diagrams and different
interaction terms get different loop-corrections, it is uncertain, whether the answer
is ‘yes’. Or – one can come to the same conclusion by considering the underlying
frameworks: the Higgs mechanism is formulated in classical ﬁeld theory and, to the
best of our knowledge, it is not understood in a pure QFT framework; on the other
hand, the RG-ﬂow is a pure quantum effect.
Some readers may wonder whether the Lagrangian of the scaled model still
describes a consistent QFT-model, if it is not derivable by the Higgs mechanism?
The answer is ‘yes’, for the following reasons: by Poincaré invariance, relevant
discrete symmetries and renormalizability are maintained under the RG-ﬂow,
the crucial requirement for consistency of a quantum gauge model is physical
consistency (PC) [8, 17]. This is the condition that the free BRST-charge1 commutes
with the “S-matrix” in the adiabatic limit, in order that the latter induces a well-
deﬁned operator on the physical subspace. We give a model-independent proof that
PC is maintained under the RG-ﬂow (Theorem 3.1).
In the literature we could not ﬁnd an explicit ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question in
the title. However, some papers silently assume that the answer is ‘yes’ – see the
few examples mentioned in [5, Introduction]. The answer certainly depends on the
renormalization scheme.
We work with the deﬁnition of the RG-ﬂow given in framework Epstein-Glaser
renormalization [12]: since a scaling transformation amounts to a change of the
renormalization prescription, it can equivalently be expressed by a renormalization
of the interaction – this is an application of the Main Theorem, see [3, 6, 15, 18]. The
so deﬁned RG-ﬂow depends on the renormalization scheme via the two possibilities

that the scaling transformation may act on the renormalization mass scale(s) or it
may not; and this may be different for different Feynman diagrams.
We investigate the question in the title by explicit 1-loop calculations – the
technical details are omitted in this paper, they are given in [5]. To minimise the
computations, we study the model of one massive vector ﬁeld, that is, we start the
RG-ﬂow with the U.1/-Higgs model.

Precise Formulation of the Question
Lagrangian of the initial model The just mentioned model has one massive vector
ﬁeld A	, the corresponding Stückelberg ﬁeld B, a further real scalar ﬁeld ' (“Higgs
ﬁeld”) and the Fadeev-Popov ghost ﬁelds .u ; Qu/. The Lagrangian reads

where ' means equal up to the addition of terms of type @aA, where jaj  1 and
A is a local ﬁeld polynomial. In addition we use the notations F2 WD .@	A 

respectively, as it turns out below in (6). The gauge-ﬁxing and ghost Lagrangian are
given by

respectively, where ƒ is the gauge-ﬁxing parameter. The masses of the A- and '-
ﬁeld are generated by the Higgs mechanism.

In view of perturbation theory we split Ltotal into a free part L0 (all bilinear terms)
and an interacting part L (all tri- and quadrilinear terms):

With s0 WD sjD0 we denote its version for the free theory. We point out that L and
L0 are invariant w.r.t. the pertinent BRST-transformation:
sL ' 0 ;
s0L0 ' 0 ;
(9)
where ' has the same meaning as above.
Deﬁnition of the RG-ﬂow In view of Epstein-Glaser renormalization [12] we write
L D  L1 C 2 L2
(10)
and introduce an adiabatic switching of the coupling constant by a test function
g 2 D.R4/:

(11)
For later purpose we have introduced the upper index m WD .m; mH/.
In the Epstein-Glaser framework the RG-ﬂow is deﬁned by a scaling transforma-
tion  [3, 6, 15]:

and a simultaneous scaling of the masses m 7! 1m D .1m; 1mH/; see [6]
for the precise deﬁnition of . Under this transformation the classical action is
invariant (up to a scaling of the switching function g).
In QFT scaling invariance is in general broken in the process of renormalization.
To explain this, we introduce the generating functional S.iL.g// of the time-ordered
products of L.g/, i.e.
Tn.L.g/˝n/ D
dn
in dn jD0 S.i L.g//
or generally
Tn D S.n/.0/ ;
(13)
which we construct inductively by Epstein-Glaser renormalization [12]. To deﬁne
the RG-ﬂow, we need to perform the adiabatic limit
SŒL WD lim
"#0 S.iL.g"// ;
g".x/ WD g."x/ ;
(14)
where g.0/ D 1 is assumed. For a purely massive model and with a suitable
(re)normalization of S.iL.g//, this limit exists in the strong operator sense. For a
rigorous proof of this statement we refer to [12, 13]; in this paper we treat the
adiabatic limit on a heuristic level.
The Main Theorem of perturbative renormalization [6, 15, 18] implies that a
scaling transformation of SŒL, i.e.
SmŒLm 7! .S1mŒ1
 .Lm// ;
can equivalently be expressed by a renormalization of the interaction Lm 7! z.Lm/
(“running interaction”), explicitly
.S1mŒ1
 .Lm// D SmŒz.Lm/ ;
(15)
where the lower index m of Sm denotes the masses of the Feynman propagators.
This is explained in detail in Sect. 3.
The form of the running interaction Using general properties of the running
interaction (derived in [6]), we know that each term appearing in z.L/ is Lorentz
invariant, has ghost number D 0 and has mass dimension 	 4. In addition, using
that L (7) is even under the ﬁeld parity transformation
.A; B; '; u; Qu/ 7! .A; B; '; u; Qu/ ;
(16)
one easily derives that also z.L/ is even under this transformation. One can also
show that only one term containing the Fadeev-Popov ghosts can appear in .z.L/
L/, namely a term  Quu. Moreover, with a slight restriction on the (re)normalization
of S.iL.g//, one can exclude 1-leg terms from z.L/ [5].

In view of the Higgs mechanism for L C z.L/ (27), the deﬁnition of 12 is
rather complicated. Apart from the A@B-term, we have absorbed the novel bilinear
interaction terms in the free Lagrangian. Since every new ﬁeld is of the form (19),
the condition (20) is an equation for polynomials in the old ﬁelds; equating the

By the renormalization of the wave functions, masses and gauge ﬁxing-
parameter, we change the splitting of the total Lagrangian L0 Cz.L/ into a free and
interacting part, i.e. we change the starting point for the perturbative expansion. To
justify this, one has to show that the two perturbative QFTs given by the splittings
L0 C z.L/ and L
0 C L, respectively, have the same physical content.2 Using the
framework of algebraic QFT, one has to show the following: given a renormalization
prescription for L0 C z.L/, there exists a renormalization prescription for L
0 C L,
such that, in the algebraic adiabatic limit, the pertinent nets of local observables
(see [2] or [3, 6]) are equivalent. This task is beyond the scope of this paper.

obtain rather restrictive relations among the coefﬁcients e which imply the

Physical Consistency and Perturbative Gauge Invariance
Physical consistency (PC) The generic problem of a model containing spin 1 ﬁelds
is the presence of unphysical ﬁelds. A way to solve this problem in a scattering
framework is to construct S.iL.g// such that the following holds. For the asymptotic
free ﬁelds let Hphys be the “subspace” of physical states. In the adiabatic limit lim
g ! 1, S.iL.g// has to induce a well deﬁned operator from Hphys into itself, which
is the physically relevant S-matrix.
To formulate this condition explicitly, let Q be the generator of the free BRST-
transformation s0 WD sjD0:
ŒQ; 
?  i„ s0 ;
 D A	 ; B ; ' ; u ; Qu ;
(42)
where Œ ; 
? denotes the graded commutator w.r.t. the ?-product and  means
‘equal modulo the free ﬁeld equations’. With that we may write Hphys WD
ker Q
ran Q,
and the mentioned, fundamental condition on S.iL.g// is equivalent to
0  ŒQ; SŒL?jker Q  lim
"#0ŒQ; S.iL.g"/=„/?jker Q ;
(43)
see [8, 17]. For simplicity we omit the restriction to ker Q and call the resulting
condition “physical consistency (PC)”.
Stability of PC under the RG-ﬂow A main, model-independent result of this
paper is that PC is maintained under the RG-ﬂow.
Theorem 3.1 Assume that Sm.iL.g// is renormalized such that the adiabatic limit
" # 0 exists and is unique for  ı S1m ı 1
 .iL.g"// 8 > 0, and such that
Sm.iLm.g// fulﬁlls PC for all values mj > 0 of the masses m D .mj/. Then, the
following holds:

Q; SŒz.L/

?  lim
"#0ŒQ; S.iz.L/.g"//?  0 ;
8 > 0 :
(44)
Hence, at least in this weak form, BRST-invariance of the time-ordered products is
stable under the RG-ﬂow.
Proof As a preparation we explain the construction of z.L/ and derive (15).
Assuming that S fulﬁlls the axioms of Epstein-Glaser renormalization, this holds
also for the scaled time-ordered products  ı S ı 1
 ; therefore, the Main Theorem
[6, 15] applies: there exists a unique map Z  Z;m from the space of local
interactions into itself such that
 ı S1m ı 1

D Sm ı Z;m
(45)
(the lower index m on S and Z denotes the masses of the underlying ?-product,
i.e. the masses of the Feynman propagators).

Perturbative gauge invariance (PGI) For the initial model S.iL.g// we admit all
renormalization prescriptions which fulﬁll the Epstein-Glaser axioms [6, 12] and
perturbative gauge invariance (PGI) [7, 9, 10, 19]. The latter is a somewhat stronger
version of PC, which is formulated before the adiabatic limit g ! 1 is taken.
In detail, PGI is the condition that to the given interaction L.g/ (11) there exists
a “Q-vertex”

(54)
The latter equation is understood in the sense of formal power series in  and „.
That PGI implies PC, is easy to see (on the heuristic level on which we treat the
adiabatic limit in this paper): the r.h.s. of (54) vanishes in the adiabatic limit, since
it is linear in the Q-vertex, the latter is linear in @g and @g"  ".
Requiring PGI, renormalizability and some obvious properties as Poincaré
invariance and relevant discrete symmetries, the Lagrangian of the Standard model
of electroweak interactions has been derived in [1, 7]. In this way the presence of
Higgs particles and chirality of fermionic interactions can be understood without
recourse to any geometrical or group theoretical concepts (see also [21]).
It is well-known that the U.1/-Higgs model is anomaly-free. Hence, our initial
model can be renormalized such that PGI (54) holds true for all values of m; mH > 0.
Using Theorem 3.1, we conclude that this model is consistent at all scales.

all scales, i.e. the Eqs. (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37), (38), (39) and (40),

The Two Ways to Renormalize

with jPj D n and jPj D 1, resp., are explicitly written out.
We are now going to investigate the contribution to the r.h.s. of (55) of a primitive
divergent diagram , i.e.  has singular order3 !./  0 and does not contain any
subdiagram 1   with less vertices and with !.1/  0. For such a diagram, the
expression in the second line of (55) vanishes.

For simplicity we assume that 0 	 !./ < 2; this assumption is satisﬁed for all
1-loop calculations which are done in [5] and whose results are used in this paper.
Applying the scaling and mass expansion (“sm-expansion”) [4], we then know that
t

Steinmann’s scaling degree of t, which measures the UV-behaviour of t [20]. In the Epstein-Glaser
framework, renormalization is the extension of a distribution tı 2 D0.Rl n f0g/ to a distribution
t 2 D0.Rl/, with the condition that sd.t/ D sd.tı/. In the case sd.tı/ < l, the extension is unique,
due to the scaling degree requirement, and obtained by “direct extension”, see [2, Theorem 5.2],
[6, Appendix B] and [11, Theorem 4.1].

version). The remainder scales homogeneously, D r
m=.y/ D r

can be renormalized by direct extension (see Footnote 3).
To investigate D t.y/t.y/, we omit the upper index  and use the notations
! WD !./, l WD .n1/ and Yj WD y2
j i0. We start with the unrenormalized version
tı 2 D0.R4l n f0g/ of t WD t, which scales homogeneously:
!C4l tı.y/ D tı.y/ :
(58)
We work with an analytic regularization [14]:
tı.y/ WD tı.y/ .M2lY1 : : : Yl/ ;
(59)
where  2 C n f0g with jj sufﬁciently small, and M > 0 is a renormalization mass
scale. tı scales also homogeneously – by the regularization we gain that the degree
(of the scaling) is .!C4l2l/, which is not an integer. Therefore, the homogeneous
extension t 2 D0.R4l/ is unique and can explicitly be written down by differential
renormalization [11, Sect. IV.D].
Using minimal subtraction for the limit  ! 0 we obtain an admissible extension

The breaking term is unique, i.e. independent of M; therefore, we may
admit different values of M for different diagrams, however, all M’s must be
independent of m; mH.
(B) In contrast, choosing M such that it is subject to our scaling transformation, i.e.
M WD ˛1m C ˛2mH where .˛1; ˛2/ 2 .R2 n f.0; 0/g/ may be functions of

Remark 4.1 The requirement that the initial U.1/-Higgs model fulﬁlls PGI, is
neither in conﬂict with method (A) nor with method (B), for the following reason:
we require PGI only for the initial model. Now, working at one ﬁxed scale, the
renormalization constant M appearing in (60) may have any value M > 0 for both
methods (A) and (B) and, hence, one may choose it such that PGI is satisﬁed. These
methods only prescribe how M behaves under a scaling transformation: using (A) it
remains unchanged, using (B) it is also scaled: M 7! 1M.

Equality of Certain Coefﬁcients to 1-Loop Order

the ﬁrst term (which is the corresponding massless distribution) is the same: tı

Renormalization is done by extending each term on the r.h.s. of (63) individually

j m the direct extension applies (see Footnote 3), which maintains homogeneous

We point out that different renormalization mass scales M for t1 and t2 are admitted,
only their behaviour under the scaling transformation must be the same. Therefore,
this renormalization prescription is compatible with PGI of the initial U.1/-Higgs
model.
Renormalizing certain Feynman diagrams, which go over into each other by
exchanging B $ ' for some lines, by the same method (in this sense) – also triangle
and square diagrams with derivatives are concerned – we obtain that some of the

and (40) on 1-loop level, we may use that the following ﬁnite renormalizations are
admitted by the axioms of causal perturbation theory [4, 6, 12] and that they preserve

We did not ﬁnd any further ﬁnite renormalizations, which fulﬁll, besides the

e.g. terms  @Qu@u or  m Quu', and
– that the Eqs. (64) are preserved.

How to Fulﬁll the Higgs Mechanism at all Scales
There are two necessary conditions for the Higgs mechanism at all scales, which are
crucial, since they cannot be fulﬁlled by ﬁnite renormalizations.

Since the admissible ﬁnite renormalizations (66) do not modify the coefﬁcients l.1/
j ,
there is no possibility to fulﬁll (76) in this way. However, computing explicitly the
relevant coefﬁcients l.1/
j by using the renormalization method (A) for all contributing
terms, we ﬁnd that (76) holds indeed true. This computation, which is given in [5],
involves cancellations of square- and triangle-diagrams – this shows that (76) is of
a deeper kind than the equalities derived in Sect. 4.2.
The identity (76) holds also if certain classes of corresponding diagrams are
renormalized by method (B).

Performing the ﬁnite renormalizations (66), i.e. inserting (67), (68), (69), (70),
(71), (72), (73), (74) and (75) into (77), we ﬁnd that all ˛j drop out – that is, the
condition (77) cannot be fulﬁlled by means of these ﬁnite renormalizations.
Computing the explicit values for the coefﬁcients a.1/
j ; b.1/
j by using method (A)
(see [5]), we ﬁnd that (77) does not hold. Hence, using method (A) throughout, we
have 12 6D 0, i.e. the geometrical interpretation (27) is violated by terms  A@B.
However, we can fulﬁll the condition (77) by switching the method from (A)
to (B) for all diagrams contributing to b.1/
1 and a part of the diagrams contributing
to a.1/
1 [5]. (This switch concerns also all diagrams contributing to a.1/
0 , hence we
obtain a.1/

A family of solutions of the Higgs mechanism at all scales The condi-
tions (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37), (38), (39) and (40) can be solved to
1-loop order as follows: initially we renormalize all diagrams by using method (A),
except for the diagrams just mentioned, for which we use method (B) to fulﬁll the
second crucial necessary condition (77). Then we take into account the possibility
to modify the coefﬁcients e.1/

by ﬁnite renormalizations (67), (68), (69), (70),
(71), (72), (73), (74) and (75). This procedure yields the following family of

The family (78) is by far not the general solution of the conditions (30), (31),

To 1-loop order one can even ﬁnd a non-trivial solution of the clearly stronger
property of BRST-invariance of .L0 C z.L//; but this requires a very speciﬁc
combination of the methods (A) and (B) for the various 1-loop diagrams and suitable
ﬁnite renormalizations. Hence, in general, s.L0 C z.L// is not ' 0, and also s0L0 is
not ' 0; in particular these two statements hold for the family (78) – see [5].
4.5
Frequently used Renormalization Schemes
In conventional momentum space renormalization a frequently used renorma-
lization scheme is dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction, which
preserves BRST-invariance generically. Applied to the 1-loop diagrams of our
initial model, this property implies that the resulting time-ordered products fulﬁll
PGI.4 Dimensional regularization needs a mass scale M > 0; which remains in
the formulas when removing the regularization by using minimal subtraction, and
plays the role of the renormalization mass scale. Usually M is chosen according
to method (A); and the minimal subtraction prescription forbids to perform any
ﬁnite renormalization. Therefore, using this prescription, the Higgs mechanism
is not applicable at an arbitrary scale, because the second crucial necessary
condition (77) is violated. Relaxing this prescription by admitting the ﬁnite PGI-
preserving renormalizations (67), (68), (69), (70), (71), (72), (73), (74) and (75),
the violation of (77) cannot be removed.
Another state independent renormalization scheme is the central solution of
Epstein and Glaser [12]. (For 1-loop diagrams this scheme corresponds to BPHZ-
subtraction at p D 0.) Since the subtraction point p D 0 is scaling invariant, the
central solution maintains homogeneous scaling (w.r.t. .x; m/ ! .x; m=/; cf. [4,
Sec. 2.3]); hence, the pertinent RG-ﬂow is trivial.
In the conventional literature one meets also state dependent renormalization
conditions: e.g. in the adiabatic limit the vacuum expectation values of certain time-
ordered products must agree with the “experimentally” known values for the masses
of stable particles in the vacuum, and analogous conditions for parameters of certain
vacuum correlation functions. Since “experimental” results are not subject to our
scaling transformation, a lot of diagrams are renormalized by method (A), if we use
such a scheme. To 1-loop level, the validity of the Higgs mechanism at all scales
amounts then mainly to the question: is it nevertheless possible to fulﬁll the second
4We are not aware of a proof of this statement, but it is very plausible. A corresponding statement
for higher loop diagrams involves a partial adiabatic limit, because such diagrams contain inner
vertices, which are integrated out with g.x/ D 1 in conventional momentum space renormalization
– but PGI is formulated before the adiabatic limit g ! 1 is taken.

crucial necessary condition (77), which requires to renormalize certain diagrams by
method (B)?

Summary and Conclusions
In the Epstein-Glaser framework the obvious way to deﬁne the RG-ﬂow is to use
the Main Theorem in the adiabatic limit [3, 6, 15, 18]: the effect of a scaling trans-
formation (scaling with  > 0) can equivalently be expressed by a renormalization
of the interaction: L 7! z.L/. The so deﬁned RG-ﬂow  7! z.L/ depends on the
choice of the renormalization mass scale(s) M > 0 for the various UV-divergent
Feynman diagrams: if M is subject to our scaling transformation (method (B)) –
e.g. the mass of one of the basic ﬁelds – the pertinent diagram does not contribute to
the RG-ﬂow. In contrast, if M is a ﬁxed mass scale (method (A)), the corresponding
diagram yields a unique (i.e. M-independent), non-vanishing contribution.
Performing the renormalization of the wave functions, masses, gauge-ﬁxing
parameter and coupling parameters, we obtain a description of the scaled model
L0 C z.L/ (L0 denotes the free Lagrangian) by a new Lagrangian L
0 C L, which
has essentially the same form as the original one, L0 CL; but the basic ﬁelds and the
parameters are -dependent. The title of this paper can be reformulated as follows:
is the new Lagrangian L
0 C L derivable by the Higgs mechanism for all  > 0?
We have investigated this question for the U.1/-Higgs model to 1-loop order.
We only admit renormalizations of the initial model which fulﬁll a suitable form of
BRST-invariance of the time-ordered products – we work with PGI (54). The answer
depends not only on the choice of the renormalization method ((A) or (B)) for the
various 1-loop Feynman diagrams; the RG-ﬂow can also be modiﬁed by ﬁnite, PGI-
preserving renormalizations (66) of the initial model. Using this non-uniqueness, we
have shown that one can achieve that the Higgs mechanism is possible at all scales;
one can even fulﬁll the much stronger condition of BRST-invariance of L0 C z.L/.
But this requires a quite (Higgs mechanism) or very (BRST-invariance) speciﬁc
prescription for the choice of the renormalization method ((A) or (B)) for the various
Feynman diagrams, and for the ﬁnite renormalizations. If one uses always method
(A) – minimal subtraction is of this kind – the geometrical interpretation is violated
by terms  A@B; weakening this prescription by admitting ﬁnite PGI-preserving
renormalizations, these A@B-terms cannot be removed.
If one accepts the Higgs mechanism as a fundamental principle explaining the
origin of mass at all scales (although it is not understood in a pure QFT framework),
our results exclude quite a lot of renormalization schemes, in particular minimal
subtraction.
On the other hand we give a model-independent proof, which uses rather weak
assumptions, that the RG-ﬂow is compatible with a weak form of BRST-invariance
of the time-ordered products, namely PC (Theorem 3.1). However, in [5] it is
shown that the somewhat stronger property of PGI gets lost under the RG-ﬂow in

general, and in particular if one uses a renormalization prescription corresponding
to minimal subtraction.

Abstract Free ﬁeld theories on a four dimensional, globally hyperbolic spacetime,
whose dynamics is ruled by a Green hyperbolic partial differential operator, can
be quantized following the algebraic approach. It consists of a two-step procedure:
In the ﬁrst part, one identiﬁes the observables of the underlying physical system
collecting them in a -algebra which encodes their relational and structural prop-
erties. In the second step, one must identify a quantum state, that is a positive,
normalized linear functional on the -algebra out of which one recovers the
interpretation proper of quantum mechanical theories via the so-called Gelfand-
Naimark-Segal theorem. In between the plethora of possible states, only few of
them are considered physically acceptable and they are all characterized by the so-
called Hadamard condition, a constraint on the singular structure of the associated
two-point function. The goal of this paper is to outline a construction scheme for
these states which can be applied whenever the underlying background possesses a
null (conformal) boundary. We discuss in particular the examples of a real, massless
conformally coupled scalar ﬁeld and of linearized gravity on a globally hyperbolic
and asymptotically ﬂat spacetime.

Introduction
Quantum ﬁeld theory on curved backgrounds has witnessed a period of renaissance
in the past 20 years. From a physical perspective, cosmology is acquiring an
everyday greater relevance, mostly on account of the expected, upcoming plethora
of experimental data. The models with which these should be compared are often
aimed at the description of the dynamics of the evolution of the early Universe and
are mainly based on ﬁelds living on homogeneous and isotropic manifolds. In this
framework quantum effects are expected to play a key role, for example in shaping
the ﬂuctuations of the cosmic microwave background.
Understanding quantum ﬁeld theory beyond Minkowski spacetime has shifted
from a purely academic question to a concrete necessity and, thus, it has been
accompanied contemporary by an increasing interest in developing its structural,
foundational and mathematical aspects. In this respect a framework appears to
claim the lion’s share of interest: algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory. In a few words,
this is a mathematically rigorous approach based on two key steps. In the ﬁrst,
one codiﬁes the observables of the physical system under investigation into a -
algebra A which encompasses the information about the dynamics, locality and
causality. In the second, instead, one identiﬁes a so-called algebraic state, namely
a positive, normalized linear functional ! W A ! C. Via the Gelfand-Naimark-
Segal (GNS) theorem, one associates to the pair .A; !/ a triplet of data which in
particular identiﬁes a Hilbert space, as well as both a representation of A in terms of
linear operators thereon and a unit norm, cyclic vector. In other words, one recovers
the standard interpretation of quantum mechanical theories. Much has been written
about the algebraic approach, especially on curved backgrounds, and we refer an
interested reader to the several recent reviews, e.g., [5, 18].
We will be interested, instead, in a more speciﬁc problem. For any given algebra
A, one can easily construct several algebraic states, but one can hardly call all of
them physically relevant. The reasons are manifold and often related to pathological
behaviors such as for example the occurrence of divergences in the quantum
ﬂuctuations of observables or the impossibility of constructing Wick polynomials,
which are the basis to deal with interactions at a perturbative level. Especially
for free ﬁeld theories on globally hyperbolic spacetimes this problem has been
thoroughly discussed since the seventies and, by now, it is almost unanimously
accepted that a state, to be called physical, must be of Hadamard form. Originally
it was a condition on the form in each geodesically convex neighborhood of the
manifold of the integral kernel of the two-point function. Verifying it in concrete

cases is rather complicated if not outright impossible and, for this reason, for
many years only few examples of Hadamard states were known, e.g., the Poincaré
vacuum on Minkowski spacetime and the Bunch-Davies state for a scalar ﬁeld on
de Sitter spacetime. Although generic existence results were known via deformation
techniques [20], a cornerstone in our understanding of Hadamard states came
from the papers of Radzikowski [31, 32]. He showed that the Hadamard condition
is fully equivalent to assigning a precise form to the wavefront set of the bi-
distribution associated to the two-point correlation function of a quasi-free/Gaussian
state. Despite the necessity of using microlocal analysis, controlling explicitly the
wavefront set turns out to be much easier in concrete scenarios and, hence, starting
from [31, 32], many construction schemes for Hadamard states were devised. In this
paper, we review a particular one which originates from a possible transposition to
the algebraic framework of the often mentioned holographic principle. Called also
bulk-to-boundary correspondence, this constructive scheme was ﬁrst discussed in
[11] and it is devised to work for free ﬁeld theories on four dimensional globally
hyperbolic spacetimes possessing a null (conformal) boundary. The main idea is
based on the observation that the generators of the observables of a free ﬁeld
theory are in correspondence with smooth and spacelike compact solutions of
the underlying equations of motion. On account of the properties of the (unique)
Green operators associated to the underlying dynamics, each of these solutions
propagates to the null boundary identifying thereon a smooth function. Hence, by
constructing a suitable -algebra of functions on the null boundary, one can put the
algebra of observables of a free ﬁeld theory in correspondence with a -subalgebra
of the boundary one. More importantly this entails that each algebraic state on
the boundary identiﬁes a counterpart for the free ﬁeld theory living on the bulk
spacetime. The net advantage of this procedure is twofold: On the one hand, the
boundary usually possesses an inﬁnite dimensional symmetry group, which, exactly
as the Poincaré group in Minkowski spacetime, allows to identify a distinguished
state thereon. On the other hand, the theorem of propagation of singularities in
combination with a control of the wavefront set of the Green operators allows
us to prove that such distinguished, boundary state induces a bulk counterpart of
Hadamard form.
Up to now this procedure has been applied successfully in several different
contexts and for different theories ranging from scalar ﬁelds on cosmological
spacetimes [12, 13] and on black hole spacetimes [9, 13], to Dirac ﬁelds on
cosmological and asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes [15], to free electromagnetism
[10]. It is noteworthy that this procedure allows also for the identiﬁcation of
local ground states [16] and it is suitable to be translated in the language of
pseudodifferential calculus, as shown recently in these interesting papers [21–23].
Since we cannot go into the details of all these results, we decided to focus our
attention on two special but instructive applications of the bulk-to-boundary corre-
spondence. The ﬁrst discusses the procedure for a real, massless and conformally
coupled scalar ﬁeld on asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes [11]. The second instead aims
at reviewing the most recent application of this construction and at showing the

additional complications arising for linear gauge theories, namely we shall discuss
linearized gravity following [6].
The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we outline the classical dynamics
of a real scalar ﬁeld and the construction of the algebra of ﬁelds. In Sect.2.1, ﬁrst we
introduce the class of asymptotically ﬂat and globally hyperbolic, four dimensional
spacetimes and, subsequently, we discuss the bulk-to-boundary correspondence
and particularly the construction of a Hadamard state for a massless, conformally
coupled scalar ﬁeld. In Sect. 3, we focus our attention on linearized gravity and we
show how to construct an algebra of ﬁelds while dealing with gauge freedom. To
conclude, in Sect. 3.1, we repeat brieﬂy the construction of Hadamard states starting
from future null inﬁnity, focusing mainly on the additional problems brought by
gauge invariance. On account of the lack of space, we plan to avoid giving detailed
proofs of all mathematical statements, referring each time instead to the relevant
literature.

Scalar Field Theory
In this section, we shall outline the quantization within the algebraic framework
of the simplest example of ﬁeld theory. First of all, we need to specify the
class of backgrounds which we consider as admissible and which, henceforth,
are referred to as spacetimes. We allow only four dimensional, connected, smooth
manifolds M endowed with a smooth Lorentzian metric g of signature .; C; C; C/.
Furthermore, we require .M; g/ to be globally hyperbolic, that is M possesses a
Cauchy surface †, a closed achronal subset of M whose domain of dependence
coincides with the whole spacetime – for more details, refer to [34, Ch. 8]. The
existence of a Cauchy surface leads to several noteworthy consequences. In between
them, we stress that the property of being globally hyperbolic entails in particular
that M is isometric to the Cartesian product R  † and thereon there exists a
coordinate system such that the line element reads

of view, they are all equivalent, two cases are often considered in the literature:

 D 0, also known as minimal coupling or 
 D 1
6, the conformal coupling. In this
paper, we will be interested mainly in this last option, moreover, with a vanishing
mass. Regardless of the value of m and 
, the operator P is a special case of a Green
hyperbolic partial differential operator – refer to [2]. Hence, the smooth solutions
of (1) can be constructed in terms of a Cauchy problem, for which smooth initial
data are assigned on any but ﬁxed Cauchy surface ftg  †. Yet, this approach
breaks manifestly covariance and, especially from the perspective of the algebraic
quantization scheme, it is more appropriate to adopt a different approach, namely
that of Green functions. To this end, we introduce a notable class of functions:
Deﬁnition 2.1 We call C1
tc .M/ the collection of all timelike compact functions, that
is f 2 C1
tc .M/ if f is a smooth function such that, for all p 2 M, supp. f/ \ J˙. p/
is either empty or compact. Here J˙. p/ stands for the causal future (+) and past (-)
of p.
Following [2, 33] and generalizing slightly the content of [3, 4],
Deﬁnition 2.2 We call retarded (+) and advanced () Green operators associated
to the Klein-Gordon operator P, two linear maps E˙ W C1
tc .M/ ! C1.M/ such
that, for every f 2 C1
tc .M/,

and supp

E˙. f/

propagator.
If we introduce the space of all smooth solutions of (1),
S.M/ :D f 2 C1.M/ j P D 0g;
(2)
advanced and retarded Green operators can be used to prove two important
properties of (1) which we only recollect here:
•
There exists an isomorphism of topological vector spaces between S.M/ and
C1
tc .M/
PŒC1
tc .M/ which is realized by E. In other words, for every  2 S.M/, there exists
Œ f 2

PŒC1
tc .M/ such that  D E. f/ regardless of the chosen representative in Œ f.
•
Let Ssc.M/  S.M/ be the vector subspace of the spacelike compact, smooth
solutions  to (1), that is supp./ \ .ftg  †/ is compact for all values of t.
Still via the causal propagator, Ssc.M/ is isomorphic to
C1

PŒC1

0 .M/
is the collection of smooth and compactly supported functions on M. Most
notably Ssc.M/ is a symplectic space if endowed with the following weakly non-

Having under control the space of all smooth solutions of (1), we can introduce
the notion of observable for a real scalar ﬁeld. Notice that, at this stage, we are still
working at a purely classical level. The underlying paradigm is that an observable
is nothing but an assignment of a real number to any conﬁguration of a physical
system, done in a way which is compatible with the underlying dynamics. At a
mathematical level, this heuristic statement can be translated as follows: Let us
consider off-shell/kinematical conﬁgurations, namely all  2 C1.M/ and, for any
f 2 C1
0 .M/, we deﬁne the linear functional
Ff W C1.M/ ! R;
 7! Ff./ :D
Z
M
d	g .x/f.x/:
(4)
The map Ff plays the role of a classical linear observable for the kinematical
conﬁgurations of a Klein-Gordon ﬁeld and, from standard results in functional
analysis, we can also infer that the assignment f 7! Ff is injective and that the
collection of all functionals, built in this way, is separating. This entails that, for
every ; 0 2 C1.M/, we can ﬁnd at least one f 2 C1
0 .M/ such that Ff ./ ¤
Ff.0/.
In order to codify in this construction the information of the dynamics, it sufﬁces
to restrict the kinematical conﬁgurations to the dynamically allowed, namely to
S.M/  C1.M/. In other words we consider now the assignment f 2 C1
0 .M/ 7!
Ff W S.M/ ! R. While the property of being a separating set is left untouched
by the restriction of the conﬁgurations allowed, injectivity is no longer valid. As a
matter of fact, one can prove that Ff./ D 0 for all  2 S.M/ if and only if there
exists h 2 C1
0 .M/ such that f D P.h/. For this reason we identify those linear
functionals Ff and Ff 0 on S.M/ such that f  f 0 2 PŒC1
0 .M/. To summarize, the
space of linear classical observables is

notice that Eobs.M/ is isomorphic to the labeling space
C1
0 .M/
PŒC1
0 .M/ and, thus, it comes
naturally endowed with the symplectic form (3). On the other hand, we remark that
the choice of observables is far from being unique. Our guiding principles have been
essentially three: We want Eobs.M/ to separate all dynamical conﬁgurations, to lack
any redundant observable and to be a symplectic space. While in the analysis of
a real scalar ﬁeld, our approach might look as an overkill, which ultimately yields
already well-known results, we stress that the paradigm that we used is very effective
as soon as we deal with gauge theories – see for example [7].

Hadamard States From Null Inﬁnity
83
Having under control the dynamics of a real scalar ﬁeld and having chosen a
linear space of classical observables is the starting point of the quantization scheme
that we follow. As mentioned in the introduction the algebraic scheme is based on
two steps, the ﬁrst of which consists of regrouping all observables into a suitable
-algebra. Starting from (5),
Deﬁnition 2.3 We call algebra of ﬁelds for a real scalar ﬁeld, whose dynamics is
ruled by (1), the quotient F.M/ D T .M/
I.M/ . Here
T .M/ :D

Eobs.MI C/˝n;
is the universal tensor algebra endowed with complex conjugation as -operation,
where Eobs.MI C/ D Eobs.M/ ˝ C while Eobs.MI C/˝0
:D C. I.M/ is the -
ideal generated by the canonical commutation relations Œ f ˝ Œ f 0  Œ f 0 ˝ Œ f 
iE .Œ f; Œ f 0/ I, where I is the identity in T .M/.
Notice that in the deﬁnition we have used implicitly the identiﬁcation between
classical observables and the labeling space
C1
0 .M/
PŒC1
0 .M/ while E .Œ f; Œ f 0/ is the
symplectic form (3). Although much has been written in the literature about F.M/,
we want to recall here two of its most important properties, the proof of which can
be found for example in [6].
Proposition 2.4 The algebra of ﬁelds F.M/
1. is causal, that is elements of F.M/ localized in causally disjoint regions
commute,
2. fulﬁlls the time-slice axiom. Let O
 M be a globally hyperbolic open
neighborhood of a spacelike Cauchy surface †, that is O contains all causal
curves for .M; g/ whose endpoints lie in O. Let F.O/ be the algebra of ﬁelds for
a real scalar ﬁeld in .O; gjO/. Then F.O/ is -isomorphic to F.M/.
We have completed the ﬁrst part of the algebraic quantization procedure and,
thus, we are left with the second and last one. From a more general point of view,
given any unital -algebra A, we call algebraic state a positive and normalized
linear functional ! W A ! C such that
!.I/ D 1;
!.aa/  0; 8 a 2 A;
where I is the unit of A. States are relevant since, in combination with A, they allow
for recovering the probabilistic interpretation proper of quantum theories via the
celebrated GNS theorem, which we recollect here – see [30, Ch. 14]:
Theorem 2.5 Let ! be a state on a unital -algebra A. There exists a dense
subspace D of a Hilbert space .H; .; //, as well as a representation  W A ! L.D/
and a unit norm, cyclic vector  2 D, such that !./ D .; .// and D D
.A/. The GNS triple .D; ; / is uniquely determined up to unitary equivalence.

84
C. Dappiaggi
We are interested especially in the case where the -algebra is F.M/. In
this respect, constructing algebraic states is not a difﬁcult operation and several
examples are easily available. Yet, in between all of them, most of these states
cannot be considered physically acceptable and one of the biggest challenges in
the algebraic approach to quantum ﬁeld theory has been indeed to identify suitable
criteria to single out states which yield a good physical behavior. Especially when
one cannot exploit Poincaré covariance to construct a (unique) vacuum state,
e.g., when the underlying background is curved, the question is of paramount
importance. After long debates it is nowadays almost unanimously accepted that the
answer consists of requiring that an algebraic state fulﬁlls the so-called Hadamard
condition.
From a physical perspective it amounts to saying that a state is physically
acceptable if all quantum ﬂuctuations of the observables are ﬁnite and if its
ultraviolet behavior is close to that of the Poincaré vacuum. Furthermore, the class of
Hadamard states allows for a local and covariant construction of Wick polynomials,
which is a prerequisite for dealing with interactions at a perturbative level [27].
The translation at a mathematical level is the following. As a starting point, we
notice that, since F.M/ is the quotient between T .M/ and I.M/, assigning a state
! W F.M/ ! C is equivalent to constructing all n-point correlation functions
!n W

C1
0 .M/
˝n ! C fulﬁlling suitable constraints so to ensure positivity
and compatibility both with the dynamics and with the canonical commutations
relations. In between all states, most notable are the quasi-free/Gaussian ones, which
are characterized by the property of being completely determined by the associated
two-point function. With a slight abuse of notation, this is tantamount to choosing a
suitable !2 2 D0.M  M/, extending it via the formula:
!2n.1 ˝ : : : ˝ 2n/ D
X
2n2S2n
n
Y
iD1
!2.2n.2i1/ ˝ 2n.2i//;
!2nC1 D 0;
where n 2 N. Here S2n stands for the ordered permutations of n elements. Quasi-
free states allow to formulate the Hadamard property as a constraint on the singular
structure of the associated !2:
Deﬁnition 2.6 A quasi-free state ! W F.M/ ! C is called Hadamard if the
associated two-point function !2 2 D0.M  M/ is such that its wavefront set has
the following form:
WF.!2/ D
˚
.x; y; kx; ky/ 2 TM2 n f0g j .x; kx/  .y; ky/; kx F 0

:
(6)
Here .x; kx/  .y; ky/ implies that there exists a null geodesic c connecting x to y
such that kx is coparallel and cotangent to c at x and ky is the parallel transport of kx
from x to y along c. Finally, kx F 0 means that the covector kx is future-directed.
Unfortunately Deﬁnition 2.6 is not constructive and, thus, one might wonder
how to build concretely examples of Hadamard states. For many years only abstract

Hadamard States From Null Inﬁnity
85
existence results via deformation techniques [20], or examples like the Poincaré
vacuum and the Bunch-Davies state respectively on Minkowski and on the de Sitter
spacetime were known. Yet, in the last decade, many novel construction schemes
for Hadamard states, applicable in different frameworks, were devised. In the next
section, we shall review one of them which is especially suited for those linear
ﬁeld theories built on globally hyperbolic spacetimes possessing a null (conformal)
boundary.
2.1
Hadamard States from Null Inﬁnity – I
In this section, we outline a procedure to construct explicitly Hadamard states,
sometimes known as bulk-to-boundary correspondence. We will not work in full
generality and we will be interested only in a massless, conformally coupled real
scalar ﬁeld, that is the dynamics is ruled by (1) with m D 0 and 
 D
1
6. It is
important to remark once more that the procedure, that we outline can be and has
been applied to a wider range of free ﬁelds and of curved backgrounds, as we have
already mentioned in the introduction. Since a full account of all these results would
require much more space than that at our disposal, we start by reviewing the ﬁrst
application of this construction method, as it appeared in [11, 28, 29].
In particular, as starting point, we focus our attention on a particular class of glob-
ally hyperbolic spacetimes which are distinguished since they possess an asymptotic
behavior along null directions which mimics that of Minkowski spacetime. Used
extensively and successfully in the deﬁnition of black hole regions [34], the most
general class of asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes includes several important physical
examples, such as for instance the Schwarzschild and the Kerr solutions to Einstein’s
equations. Here we employ the deﬁnition of asymptotic ﬂatness, as introduced
by Friedrich in [19]. To wit, we consider an asymptotically ﬂat spacetime with
future timelike inﬁnity iC, i.e., a globally hyperbolic spacetime .M; g/, hereby
called physical spacetime, such that there exists a second globally hyperbolic
spacetime .e
M; Qg/, called unphysical spacetime, with a preferred point iC 2 e
M, a
diffeomorphism ˆ W M ! ˆ.M/  e
M and a function „ W ˆ.M/ ! .0; 1/ so that
ˆ.„2Qg/ D g. Furthermore, the following requirements ought to be satisﬁed:
(a) If we call J
e
M.iC/ the causal past of iC, this is a closed set such that ˆ.M/ D
J

M.iC/ n @J

e
M.iC/ D I C [ fiCg, where I C is
called future null inﬁnity.
(b) „ can be extended to a smooth function on the whole e
M and it vanishes on
I C [ fiCg. Furthermore, d„ ¤ 0 on I C while d„ D 0 on iC and er	er „ D
2 Qg	 at iC.
(c) Introducing n	 :D er	„, there exists a smooth and positive function 
 supported
at least in a neighborhood of I C such that er	.
4n	/ D 0 on I C and the
integral curves of 
1n are complete on future null inﬁnity.

86
C. Dappiaggi
Notice that we shall, henceforth, identify M with ˆ.M/. Here er is the Levi-Civita
connection built out of Qg. In the above deﬁnition, future timelike inﬁnity plays a
distinguished role, contrary to what happens in the more traditional deﬁnition of
asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes where iC is replaced by i0, spatial inﬁnity – see
for example [34, Section 11]. The reason for our choice is motivated by physics:
We are interested in working with the algebra F.M/ of Deﬁnition 2.3 which is
constructed out of E, the causal propagator associated to the operator P as in (1)
with m D 0 and 
 D
1
6. This entails in particular that, for any smooth and
compactly supported function f, its image under the action of the causal propagator
is supported in the causal future and past of supp. f/. Therefore, it will be important
in our investigation that future timelike inﬁnity is actually part of the unphysical
spacetime, so to be able to control the behavior of E. f/ thereon. Such requirement
can be relaxed particularly if one is interested in studying ﬁeld theories on manifolds
like the Kruskal extension of Schwarzschild where iC cannot be made part of the
unphysical spacetime. The price to pay in this case is the necessity to make sure
that any solution of the classical dynamics falls off sufﬁciently fast as it approaches
future timelike inﬁnity. This line of reasoning has been pursued in [14], though we
shall not follow it here since it relies heavily on the fact that a very speciﬁc manifold
has been chosen. On the contrary, we work with a large class of backgrounds.
Before proceeding toward the construction of a Hadamard state for a massless,
conformally coupled, real scalar ﬁeld on a globally hyperbolic and asymptotically
ﬂat spacetime, we point out a few distinguished properties of future null inﬁnity –
see [28, 34] and references therein:
•
I C is a three dimensional, null submanifold of e
M, diffeomorphic to R  S2.
Furthermore, there exists an open neighborhood U of e
M containing I C and
a coordinate system .u; „; ; '/, called Bondi chart, such that .; '/ are the
standard coordinates on the unit 2-sphere, u is an afﬁne parameter along the
null geodesic generating I C, while „ is the conformal factor, promoted to
coordinate. In this system I C is the locus „ D 0 and the line elements reads

87
By direct inspection, it turns out that (7) identiﬁes the semidirect product
SL.2; C/ Ë C1.S2/. Notice that the BMS group coincides, moreover, with the
group of asymptotic symmetries of the physical spacetime .M; g/ [24].
We have all the ingredients to implement the bulk-to-boundary correspondence
mentioned at the beginning of the section. The procedure is based on two key
structures. First of all, one deﬁnes on top of I C a symplectic space of functions
and an associated -algebra of ﬁelds. Secondly, one looks for an injective -
homomorphism from F.M/, the algebra of ﬁelds deﬁned in the physical spacetime
.M; g/, and the one on I C. As a byproduct of such homomorphism, every algebraic
state on the boundary induces via pull-back a bulk counterpart. The net advantage
is the fact that, at a geometric level, future null inﬁnity comes endowed with the
BMS group, which is an inﬁnite dimensional symmetry group, which, exactly as the
Poincaré group in Minkowski spacetime, allows to identify a distinguished ground
state.
In order to implement this program, let us deﬁne:
S.I C/ :D ˚ 2 C1.I C/ j  and @u 2 L2.I C; d	I/ ;
(9)
where d	I D sin dudd'. This is a symplectic space if endowed with

Following the same procedure used starting from Eobs.M/ in (5),
Deﬁnition 2.7 We call -algebra of ﬁelds on I C, F.I C/ D T .I C/
I.IC/ , where
T .I C/ :D

S.I CI C/˝n:
Here S.I CI C/ D S.I C/ ˝ C whereas S.I CI C/˝0 :D C. I.I C/ is the -ideal
generated by the relation  ˝  0   0 ˝   iI. ;  0/I, where I is the identity
in T .I C/. The -operation is complex conjugation.
At this stage it becomes clear why we chose to work only with a massless, con-
formally coupled real scalar ﬁeld. Since we want to construct a -homomorphism
between F.M/ and F.I C/, compatibility between the canonical commutation
relations in I.M/ and those in I.I C/ suggest that we should start from an injective
symplectomorphism between .Eobs.M/; / and .S.I C/; I/. In order to relate an
equivalence class of compactly supported functions in M and a smooth function on
I C, the procedure calls for propagating the former to null inﬁnity via the causal
propagator E associated to the underlying dynamics. Yet, one needs to remember
that I C is a submanifold of the unphysical spacetime which is related to the

88
C. Dappiaggi
physical one by a conformal transformation. In this respect it is a well-known fact
that (1) is not well-behaved under such map, leading to pathological behaviors at
I C if a mass term or a coupling different from 
 D 1
6 is present. On the contrary, as
the name conformal coupling suggests, a solution to the massless and conformally
coupled Klein-Gordon on .M; g/ has the property of staying a solution of the same
equation on .e
M; Qg/ up to a conformal rescaling. More precisely, the following holds
true – see for example [11, 34]:
Proposition 2.8 Let .M; g/ be a globally hyperbolic and asymptotically ﬂat space-
time, whose associated unphysical spacetime .e
M; Qg/, QgjM D „2g, is also globally
hyperbolic. Let R and eR be the Ricci scalars built out of g and Qg respectively. If  is

P being the causal propagator of bP.
As a byproduct of this last proposition, we have associated to every observable
in the physical spacetime a spacelike compact smooth solution of the massless, con-
formally coupled Klein-Gordon equation on .e
M; Qg/. Due to the support properties
of the causal propagator, every such solution can be restricted to I C, which is a
smooth submanifold of e
M. The relevant map is

(10)
As proven in [28, 29] the following key property holds true:
Proposition 2.9 The application ‡, constructed in (10), is an injective linear map
from Eobs.M/ to S.I C/ which is, moreover, a symplectomorphism. In other words,
for every Œ f; Œ f 0 2 Eobs.M/

where  and I are respectively the bulk and the boundary symplectic forms.
Notice that this proposition allows us to extend the action of the projection map
‡ at a level of algebra of ﬁelds. On the one hand, we have automatically built a map
from T .M/ to T .I C/, since ‡ projects classical linear observables to elements
in S.I C/ which are respectively the generating space for the bulk and for the
boundary universal tensor algebra. On the other hand, since ‡ preserves at the same
time the symplectic form, such map is compatible with the ideal generated by the
canonical commutation relations on M and by I on I C. Since the -operation
is complex conjugation both in the bulk and in the boundary and since ‡ leaves it
untouched, we have the following lemma:
Lemma 2.10 There exists an injective -homomorphism  W F.M/ ! F.I C/
which is deﬁned by its action on the generators, namely .Œ f/ :D ‡.Œ f/, Œ f 2
Eobs.M/  F.M/, where ‡ is the map (10).

Hadamard States From Null Inﬁnity

The most important consequence of this lemma is the following: Let !I
W
F.=C/ ! C be a normalized, positive linear functional, then
! :D !I W F.M/ ! C;
a 7! !.a/ :D .!I/.a/ D !I..a//; 8 a 2 F.M/;
is a state for the algebra of ﬁelds on .M; g/.
As a consequence, we can focus our attention on constructing algebraic states
directly on null inﬁnity, studying only subsequently the properties of the bulk
counterpart, obtained via pull-back. As mentioned before, the advantage is the
presence of the inﬁnite dimensional BMS group on I C. Hence, the best course
of action is to build a quasi-free/Gaussian state for F.I C/ by looking for a BMS
invariant two-point function on future null inﬁnity. This problem has been discussed
thoroughly in different publications [14, 28, 29] and we report here the main results:
Theorem 2.11 Let !2;I W S.I C/ ˝ S.I C/ ! C be

where dS2.; '/ is the standard measure on the unit 2-sphere. Then the following
holds true:
1. !2;I deﬁnes a quasi-free state !I for F.=C/. In its folium this is the unique
BMS invariant state.
2. The state ! :D !I W F.M/ ! C is a quasi-free state for the algebra of ﬁelds
in the bulk which is

of Hadamard form,
•
invariant under the action of all isometries of .M; g/.
Notice that invariance under all bulk isometries implies that our construction,
applied to Minkowski spacetime, yields the Poincaré vacuum.

Linearized Gravity
The bulk-to-boundary correspondence, described in the previous section for a
massless, conformally coupled real scalar ﬁeld, can be applied to other free ﬁelds
and to other globally hyperbolic spacetimes possessing a null boundary. Barring
minor technical details, the procedure is always the same except when one deals
with non-interacting gauge theories, since one needs to control additionally the
gauge ﬁxing. There are two cases which are certainly of relevance at a physical
level: free electromagnetism and linearized gravity. The ﬁrst was discussed a couple
of years ago in [10], while the second was only analyzed last year and, therefore,
we review it here, pointing out in particular the additional difﬁculties compared to

90
C. Dappiaggi
the scalar case. We will summarize mainly the results of [6] and of [17]. As in the
previous sections, for the lack of space, we prefer to avoid giving the proofs of our
statements, each time referring a reader to the relevant literature.
We consider still an arbitrary, globally hyperbolic and asymptotically ﬂat
spacetime .M; g/ with the additional constraint that the Ricci tensor vanishes,
Ric.g/ D 0. In other words .M; g/ is a solution of the Einstein vacuum equations.
On top of .M; g/ we consider a smooth symmetric 2-tensor h 2 .S2TM/, where
S2TM :D TM ˝s TM, the subscript s standing for symmetrization. Dynamics is

Notice that, in this section, we will alternate between a notation where indices
are explicit and one where they are implicit. This choice is related to our desire to
avoid whenever possible a heavy notation where multiple subscripts appear.
As much as Einstein’s theory comes together with invariance under the action of
the diffeomorphism group, so (11) comes endowed with the linear counterpart. In
other words two solutions h; h0 of (11) are said to be gauge equivalent if there exists
 2 .TM/ such that
h0 D h C rS;
where .rS/ab
:D r.ab/. Per direct inspection, one can realize that the operator K
in (11) is not normally hyperbolic and, thus, one cannot construct smooth solutions
using Green operators. Yet, one must keep in mind that, in gauge theories, we are
not interested in single smooth solutions but actually in gauge equivalence classes
of solutions. Hence, one can start from (11) and look for a gauge transformation
which reduces the dynamics to that ruled by a normally hyperbolic operator or by
one which at least admits Green operators. The following proposition shows that it
is indeed possible – see for example [17]:
Proposition 3.1 Let

In this last proposition, we have introduced the standard de Donder gauge and
it is noteworthy since eP is manifestly the composition of a normally hyperbolic
operator with a trace reversal. Hence, adapting Deﬁnitions 2.1 and 2.2 to the case at
hand, we associate to eP the advanced () and the retarded (+) fundamental solutions

the causal propagator of eP. Yet, contrary to the scalar case, we cannot use only
Ge
P to characterize in a covariant way the space of solutions of linearized gravity
since we need also to take into account two additional data. On the one hand, there
is the gauge-ﬁxing condition div.IQh/ D 0. This can be implemented by suitably
restricting the space of admissible initial data, or more appropriately the admissible
smooth and timelike compact sections of S2TM, exploiting that div ı I ı G˙

 are the advanced () and the retarded (+) Green operators for
the d’Alembert wave operator acting on .TM/. On the other hand, (12) is not a
complete gauge ﬁxing. As a matter of fact, if Qh is a solution of (12), so is every Qh0
such that Qh0  Qh D rS,  2 .TM/ and  D 0. Using this additional data, one
can prove the following [6, 17]:
Proposition 3.2 There exists an isomorphism between SK.M/

Having under control the space of dynamical conﬁgurations for linearized gravity
we can proceed to introducing classical linear observables along the same lines as in
Sect. 2. There are two important differences which we shall point out. First of all, we
start from all kinematical conﬁgurations .S2TM/ and, for every  2 0.S2TM/,

92
C. Dappiaggi
we deﬁne the linear functional
O W .S2TM/ ! R;
h 7! O.h/ D .; h/ :D
Z
M
d	gabhab:
(13)
The map O plays the role of a classical observable for kinematical conﬁgurations.
At this stage comes the ﬁrst difference from the scalar case, namely we need to
encode the information of gauge invariance. This can be done by restricting our
attention to those functionals of the form (13) which vanish on all pure gauge
conﬁgurations, that is those h 2 .S2TM/ such that h D rS,  2 .TM/.
Using (13) and integration by parts, this entails
O.rS/ D .; rS/ D .div./; / D 0:
The arbitrariness of  and the non-degenerateness of the pairing .; / entails that
div./ D 0. In other words, we can introduce the space of gauge invariant
functionals
Linv.M/ D fO W .S2TM/ ! R; j div./ D 0;  2 0.S2TM/g:
As last step, we need to account for dynamics which can be done by restricting
the domain of deﬁnition of the observables from .S2TM/ to SK.M/. Identifying
once more the space of linear observables with its labeling space, hence, Linv.M/
with Ker0.div/ D f 2 0.S2TM/ j div./ D 0g, the above restriction entails that
Ker0.div/ includes redundant observables which we need to quotient. As shown in
[6] this is tantamount to deﬁning the following as the space of classical observables
for linearized gravity:
Lobs.M/ :D Linv.M/
Im0.K/ ;
(14)
where Im0.K/ D f 2 0.S2TM/ j  D K.˛/; ˛ 2 0.S2TM/g. Notice the
second big difference from the scalar case. While Eobs.M/ could be endowed with
a symplectic form, this is not necessarily the case for Lobs.M/, to which we can
associate the following pre-symplectic form:
 W Lobs.M/  Lobs.M/ ! R;
.Œ; Œ0/ 7! .; Ge
P/.0[/;
(15)
where Ge
P is the causal propagator of eP, while [ is the canonical, metric-induced
musical isomorphism. It is important to stress that it is known that  is non-
degenerate if the Cauchy surface of M is compact – see for example [17] – or on
Minkowski spacetime – see [26]. To the best of our knowledge, in all other cases
the problem is still open.

Hadamard States From Null Inﬁnity
93
Having chosen a space of classical observables entails that we can deﬁne a -
algebra of observables associated to the quantum theory.
Deﬁnition 3.3 We call algebra of ﬁelds for linearized gravity, the quotient
Fgrav.M/ D Tgrav.M/
Igrav.M/. Here
Tgrav.M/ :D
1
M
nD0
Lobs.MI C/˝n;
is the universal tensor algebra endowed with complex conjugation as -operation,
where Lobs.MI C/ D Lobs.M/˝C while Lobs.MI C/˝0 :D C. Igrav.M/ is the -ideal
generated by the canonical commutation relations Œ˝Œ0Œ0˝Œi .Œ; Œ0/ I,
where I is the identity in Tgrav.M/ and  is deﬁned in (15).
Notice that, since  is not known to be symplectic, we cannot conclude that
Fgrav.M/ is semisimple. Hence, it might contain an Abelian ideal, namely there
might exist observables behaving classically regardless of the state chosen for
Fgrav.M/. Furthermore, one can also show that Fgrav.M/ satisﬁes the counterpart of
Proposition 2.4 for F.M/: causality and the time-slice axiom. We will not enter into
the details to avoid useless repetitions. The next step in our construction will be the
identiﬁcation of algebraic states of physical interest for linearized gravity. While the
deﬁnition of an algebraic state and the content of Theorem 2.5 are left unchanged,
the Hadamard condition requires to be slightly adapted to account for gauge
invariance. More precisely, since we will be mainly interested in Gaussian states for
Fgrav.M/, we will be looking for two-point functions !2 W Lobs.M/˝Lobs.M/ ! R.
In view of (14), this is tantamount to building 2 W Linv.M/ ˝ Linv.M/ ! R, weak
bi-solution of (11). Yet, since, on account of gauge invariance, Linv.M/ includes
only those  2 0.S2TM/ which are divergencefree, we cannot ensure automatically
that 2 identiﬁes a bi-distribution e2 W 0.S2TM/  0.S2TM/ ! R. Additionally,
we need to take into account that, besideseP, also the trace-reversal is present in (11).
Following [17], we deﬁne a trace-reversal operation at the level of bi-distributions
and, with a slight abuse of notation, we indicate it still with the letter I. Let thus e2
be a bi-distribution on 0.S2TM/ we call trace reversal of e2

Hadamard States from Null Inﬁnity – II
In this section, we will show how the bulk-to-boundary correspondence can be
applied to linearized gravity. Hence, from now on .M; g/ will indicate a globally
hyperbolic, asymptotically ﬂat spacetime with vanishing Ricci tensor and .e
M; Qg/ the
associated unphysical spacetime. The most notable difference between a massless,
conformally coupled real scalar ﬁeld and linearized gravity consists of the behavior
under a conformal transformation of the equations ruling the dynamics. As a matter
of fact, by mapping g to „2g, (11) transforms in such a way that several terms
proportional to inverse powers of „ appear. Taking into account that the null
boundary of an asymptotically ﬂat spacetime is the locus „ D 0, such behavior is
problematic. This feature is not present only for linearized gravity, but also for free
electromagnetism, written in terms of the vector potential. The solution in all these
cases is to exploit gauge invariance, namely to look for a suitable gauge ﬁxing which
makes the dynamics hyperbolic and, upon a conformal transformation, controls all
possible divergences due to the terms proportional to inverse powers of „. While, in
free electromagnetism, the standard Lorenz gauge is the right choice, for linearized
gravity, the de Donder gauge is not suitable for this task. The problem was tackled
in the literature, especially in connection to the stability of asymptotically simple
spacetimes and an answer was found going under the name of Geroch-Xanthopoulos
gauge [25].
Let us now go into the details of the construction. As in the scalar case, the
starting point is the identiﬁcation of a suitable space of tensors living on future null
inﬁnity. Following [1], we deﬁne
eS.I C/ D f 2 .S2TI C/ j abna D 0 and abqab D 0g;
where na D era„ and er is the covariant derivative built out of Qg. The tensor q D g
where  W I C ! e
M and qab is any inverse such that qabqacqbd D qcd. Subsequently,
we consider a vector subspace
Sgrav.I C/ :D f 2 eS.I C/ j .; /I < 1;
and
.@u; @u/I < 1g;

.; 0/I :D

cdqacqbd:
As for the real scalar case, the space of functions on future null inﬁnity has been
chosen since it has two important properties:
1. It is a symplectic space if endowed with the following antisymmetric bilinear
form:
I W Sgrav.I C/  Sgrav.I C/ ! R;
.; 0/ 7! I.; 0/ D
Z
I
d	I.abLn0
cd  0
abLncd/qacqbd;
(16)
where Ln is the Lie derivative along the vector ﬁeld n on I C.
2. The pair .Sgrav.I C/; I/ is invariant under the following representation … of
the BMS group (7): Let us ﬁx a Bondi frame on I C, let .ƒ; ˛.z; Nz// 2 BMS and
let  2 Sgrav.I C/; then, recalling (8),

….ƒ;˛/

.u; z; Nz/ D Kƒ.z; Nz/.u C ˛.z; Nz/; z; Nz/:
(17)
In view of these properties of the space of functions, which we use on future null
inﬁnity, we can deﬁne an auxiliary -algebra on I C:
Deﬁnition 3.5 The -algebra of ﬁelds for linearized gravity on future null inﬁnity
is denoted by Fgrav.I C/ D Tgrav.I C/
Igrav.I C/, where
Tgrav.I C/ :D
1
M
nD0
Sgrav.I CI C/˝n:
Here Sgrav.I CI C/ D Sgrav.I C/ ˝ C whereas Sgrav.I CI C/˝0 :D C. At the same
time Igrav.I C/ is the -ideal generated by the relation ˝00˝iI.; 0/I,
where I is the identity in Tgrav.I C/. The -operation is complex conjugation.
The next step consists of associating to each classical linear observable in .M; g/
an element of Sgrav.I C/. We follow again the procedure devised in [1]. First of all,
we remark that, to every Œ 2 Lobs.M/, we can associate Ee
P.[/, which is a smooth
and spacelike compact solution of (12) and, thus, also of (11).
Deﬁnition 3.6 We call classical radiative observables, Lrad.M/, the collection of
all Œ 2 Lobs.M/, for which Ee
P.[/ is gauge equivalent to a smooth and spacelike
compact solution h of (11) in the Geroch-Xanthopoulos gauge, that is setting ab D

wheree refers to quantities computed with respect to Qg, e.g., eCabcd is the Weyl tensor
for Qg. At the same time, we call algebra of radiative observables Frad.M/ the -
subalgebra of Fgrav.M/ built out of Lrad.M/.
Radiative observables play a distinguished role since, as shown in [1, 25], (11)
in combination with the Geroch-Xanthopoulos gauge yields an hyperbolic system
of partial differential equations on .e
M; Qg/. Thus, every  D „h, h D Ee
P.[/ and
Œ 2 Lrad.M/, can be uniquely extended to a smooth solution of the conformally
transformed equations of motion for linearized gravity in the unphysical spacetime.
More importantly such extension can be restricted to future null inﬁnity and, as
proven in [1, 6],
Proposition 3.7 Let us endow Lrad.M/ with the restriction of (15) thereon. Then,
there exists a map ‡grav W Erad.M/ ! Sgrav.I C/ such that, for all Œ; Œ0 2
Erad.M/,
I.Œ; Œ0/ D .‡grav.Œ/; ‡grav.Œ0//;
where I is deﬁned in (16). ‡grav can be extended to a -homomorphism grav W
Frad.M/ ! Fgrav.I C/ which is completely deﬁned by its action on the generators,
namely, for every Œ 2 Lrad.M/, grav.Œ/ :D ‡grav.Œ/.
Notice that, contrary to the scalar case and due to our lack of control on the
non-degenerateness of (15), we cannot conclude that grav is injective. Yet, this is no
obstacle for constructing states on Frad.M/ via a pull-back of those for Fgrav.I C/.
Before investigating this problem, we need to answer an important question, namely
if Lrad.M/ coincides with Lobs.M/. In the original paper [25], it appeared as if every
smooth and spacelike compact solution of (11) could be transformed into one in the
Geroch-Xanthopoulos gauge. Yet, a closer investigation of the procedure unveils
the presence of obstructions. Most surprisingly it turns out that problems arise in
implementing (18a) rather than (18b). More precisely, let h 2 .S2TM/ be a
solution of (11) and let h0 D h C rS,  2 .TM/. Then, a direct computation
shows that h0 satisﬁes (18a) if and only if
rbrŒba D va.h/;
va.h/ :D rbhab  rah;
where the square brackets between the subscripts stand for total antisymmetrization,
including the prefactor 1
2. This identity entails that v 2 .TM/ must be a co-exact

Hadamard States From Null Inﬁnity
97
1-form, a property which is not obviously satisﬁed. In [6], the following has been
proven:
Proposition 3.8 Let h D Ee
P.[/ with Œ 2 Lobs.M/. Then h is gauge equivalent to
a solution of (11) if and only if Tr./ D gabab is the codifferential of a compactly
supported 1-form.
Proposition 3.8 offers a more practical condition to verify the implementability
of the Geroch-Xanthopoulos gauge, although the question is still non-trivial since
one has to account for two mixing conditions,  being divergence free and its
trace being co-exact. Yet, in [6] it has been proven that, while on Minkowski
spacetime the hypotheses of Proposition 3.8 are met, there exist asymptotically ﬂat,
globally hyperbolic and Ricci ﬂat spacetimes for which they are not. Most notably
it sufﬁces that the Cauchy surface † of .M; g/ is diffeomorphic to X  S1, X being
a codimension 1 submanifold of † and that g admits a Killing ﬁeld along S1.
Having understood under which conditions radiative observables coincide with
all classical linear ones, we can revert to our main investigation, namely the
construction of Hadamard states. At this stage the procedure will be identical to
the one described in Sect. 2.1 and we shall only sketch the key points. The starting
one is Proposition 3.7 and in particular the -homomorphism grav. First of all, we
identify a distinguished quasi-free state for Fgrav.I C/:
Proposition 3.9 The map !=
2 W Sgrav.I CI C/ ˝ Sgrav.I CI C/ ! R is such that
!=
2 . ˝ 0/ D  1

ab.u; ; '/0
cd.u0; ; '/qacqbd
.u  u0  i/2
du du0 dS2.; '/;
(19)
where dS2.; '/ is the standard line element on the unit 2-sphere, unambiguously
deﬁnes a quasi-free state != W Fgrav.I C/ ! C. Furthermore:
1. != induces via pull-back a quasi-free bulk state !M W Frad.M/ ! C such that
!M :D != ı ‡,
2. != is invariant under the action … of the BMS group induced by (17) on
Fgrav.I C/.
Notice that we use the symbol … with a slight abuse of notation since we have
already introduced it to indicate in (17) the representation of the BMS group on
S.I C/. Since Fgrav.I C/ is built out of S.I C/, we feel that no confusion can arise.
As a last step, we need to combine (19) with Deﬁnition 3.4 to conclude that, for all
those asymptotically ﬂat and globally hyperbolic spacetimes for which Eobs.M/ D
Erad.M/, it holds – see [6] for the proof:
Theorem 3.10 Let  W Frad.M/ ! Fgrav.I C/ be as in Proposition 3.7. The state
!M D != ı  W Frad.M/ ! C, where != is the state introduced in Proposition 3.9,
has the following properties:

1. Its two-point function is the restriction to Erad.M/  Erad.M/ of a bi-distribution

2. It is invariant under the action of all isometries of the bulk metric g, that is
!M ı ˛ D !M. Here  W M ! M is any isometry and ˛ represents the action
of  induced on Frad.M/ by setting ˛.Œ/ D Œ on the algebra generators

3. It coincides with the Poincaré vacuum on Minkowski spacetime.

Abstract It is well-known that thermal equilibrium states in quantum statistical
mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory can be described in a mathematically rigorous
manner by means of the so-called Kubo-Martin-Schwinger(KMS) condition, which
is based on certain analyticity and periodicity properties of correlation functions.
On the other hand, the characterization of non-equilibrium states which only locally
have thermal properties still constitutes a challenge in quantum ﬁeld theory. We
discuss a recent proposal for characterization of such states by a generalized KMS
condition. The connection of this proposal to a proposal by D. Buchholz, I. Ojima
and H.-J. Roos for characterizing local thermal equilibrium states in quantum ﬁeld
theory is discussed.

Introduction
Soon after the introduction of the algebraic approach to quantum ﬁeld theory,
developed by Araki, Haag and Kastler in the 1960s [1, 15], it became clear that this
framework allows for an immediate adoption to non-relativistic quantum systems,
for example spin lattice models. This led to the conclusion that equilibrium states
in quantum statistical mechanics should be described in the operator-algebraic
framework by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, which was ﬁrst
envisaged by Haag, Hugenholtz and Winnink in [16]. The mathematically rigorous
formulation of equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics based on the KMS
condition has offered many insights into the structural properties of equilibrium
states and at the same time has revealed previously unexpected connections to pure
mathematics, in particular to Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, which had a huge
inﬂuence on the understanding of quantum ﬁeld theory, see e.g. the review article of
Borchers [3]. For references and an extensive discussion of non-relativistic quantum
statistical mechanics in the operator algebraic formulation, the reader is referred to
the monograph by Bratteli and Robinson [4]. Interestingly, it took almost 20 years
until the KMS condition was used in the rigorous investigation of thermal properties
of relativistic quantum ﬁelds. This was initiated by Buchholz and Junglas [8, 9],
leading to a fully relativistic version of the KMS condition [5] and an axiomatic
approach to thermal ﬁeld theory (à la Wightman [25]), in which the relativistic
spectrum condition is replaced by the relativistic KMS condition [6].
Although the KMS condition turned out to be fruitful in this respect, it is clear
from the outset that, in general, an arbitrary state of a quantum system will not
be an equilibrium (KMS) state, since in nature there also arises a variety of non-
equilibrium states ranging from mild perturbations of equilibrium states to steady
states (e.g. a steady heat ﬂow through a metal bar) and hydrodynamic ﬂows (for
example water in a pipe), up to states which do not admit any thermal interpretation
at all. On the side of relativistic QFT, Buchholz, Ojima and Roos [10] developed
a method for distinguishing between states which are out of equilibrium but
locally still have a thermodynamical interpretation. Heuristically speaking, a local
thermal equilibrium (LTE) state is deﬁned as a state for which certain (point-like)
observables, representing intensive thermal quantities like temperature, pressure and
thermal stress-energy, take the same values as they take if the quantum ﬁeld is
in some thermal reference state (a KMS state or a mixture of such). Below we
will discuss how this can be made precise and review several aspects of the LTE
condition in quantum ﬁeld theory.
The KMS condition is based on given analyticity and periodicity properties of
correlation functions and yields an intrinsic characterization of equilibrium states.
In contrast, the LTE condition of Buchholz, Ojima and Roos has to be regarded an
extrinsic condition, since it is based on the comparison of a state with the members
of an a priori ﬁxed family of thermal reference states. It seems to be natural to
ask if one could characterize such local equilibrium states in a manner similar to
the KMS condition, i.e. by an intrinsic condition also based on analyticity and

periodicity properties of the correlation functions of LTE states. In fact, recent
results of Gransee, Pinamonti and Verch show that this is possible. Motivated by
the analysis of correlation functions of KMS states of the free quantized scalar ﬁeld,
in [14] a generalized version of the KMS condition, called local KMS (LKMS)
condition, is introduced. Following this, it is shown that a certain class of LTE states
in the sense of [10] can be equivalently described by this condition. We will discuss
the LKMS condition and its relation to the LTE condition in Sect. 3 below.
1.1
Preliminaries
The QFT model For simplicity we consider an uncharged free scalar quantum
ﬁeld on Minkowski spacetime M D R4, with the Minkowski pseudo-metric  of
diagonal form  D diag.C1; 1; 1; 1/. The ﬁeld is regarded as an operator-
valued distribution f 7! . f/ on the space S.M/ of Schwartz functions f, where the
operators are all deﬁned on a common dense and stable domain D of the underlying
Hilbert space H. The algebra of local observables is the -algebra A.M/, generated
by multiples of 1 and ﬁnite sums as well as products of the ﬁeld operators. This
algebra is stable under the action of the proper, orthochronous Poincaré group P"
C,
implemented on the ﬁeld operators by
.ƒ;a/.. f// D .f.ƒ;a//;
(1)
where f.ƒ;a/.x/ D f.ƒ1.x  a//, and stable under the action of the gauge group Z2,
acting as .. f// D . f/. Furthermore, we assume that
(i) f 7! . f/ is linear.
(ii) . f/ D .Nf/ for all f 2 S.M/.
(iii) Klein Gordon equation: ..Cm2/f/ D 0 for all f 2 S.M/, where  denotes
the d’Alembert operator and m  0 is the mass parameter.
(iv) Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR): Œ. f/; .g/ D iE.f; g/1 for all
f; g 2 S.M/, where E denotes the causal propagator, which is deﬁned as
the difference of the advanced minus the retarded fundamental solution of the
Klein-Gordon equation. Einstein causality is expressed by E.f; g/ D 0 if f and
g have mutually spacelike separated supports.
A state on A.M/ is a continuous normalized positive linear functional ! W
A.M/ ! C. The n-point “functions” of a state are distributions in S0.Mn/, formally
given by

Mostly, we will focus on quasifree states which are determined by their two-point
functions !2 through
! eit. f/ D e 1
2 !2.f;f/t2;
(3)
where the equation is to interpreted as equating terms of equal order in t. Further-
more, we assume that the states are gauge invariant, which means ! ı  D !.
In the following we will only consider (quasifree) states fulﬁlling the Hadamard
condition, characterized by the following restriction on WF.!2/, the wave front set
of their two-point functions,
WF.!2/ D f.x; x0; k; k/ 2 TM2 W x k x0; k0 > 0g;

or even analytic Hadamard states, characterized by a restriction on the analytic
wave-front set of their two-point functions:
WFA.!2/ D f.x; x0; k; k/ 2 TM2 W x k x0; k0 > 0g:

For a discussion of the properties and a deﬁnition, the reader is referred to
[19, 26] and references therein. For a motivation why one would prefer to consider
Hadamard states, see e.g. [2].
Deﬁnition 1.1 Let A be a -algebra, ˛t a one-parameter group of automorphisms
on A, ! a state on A and ˇ > 0. Deﬁne the open strip Sˇ by Sˇ WD fz 2 C W 0 <
=z < ˇg and denote by NSˇ the closed strip. Then ! is called a KMS state at value
ˇ with respect to ˛t (or .ˇ; ˛t/-KMS state, for short), iff for any A; B 2 A there
exists a function FA;B, which is deﬁned and holomorphic on Sˇ, and continuous on
NSˇ, with boundary values

A Lorentz frame is ﬁxed by the choice of a future-directed timelike unit vector e; this
means e 2 VC, where VC denotes the open forward lightcone, and e2  e	e	 D 1.
The set of those vectors will be denoted by V1
C in the following. In the present model
the one-parameter group of time evolution on A.M/ with respect to the Lorentz
frame ﬁxed by some e 2 V1

C. Therefore thermal equilibrium states in relativistic QFT are
indicated by both inverse temperature ˇ and time direction eˇ of the rest system.
It is convenient to combine the two quantities into the inverse temperature four-
vector ˇ D ˇeˇ 2 VC so that !ˇ denotes a .ˇ; ˛

/-KMS state on A.M/. We
therefore call !ˇ simply a ˇ-KMS state. To rule out possible phase transitions,
we assume that for any given ˇ there is a unique gauge-invariant ˇ-KMS state
!ˇ on A.M/. This assumption also implies that !ˇ is invariant under spacetime
translations. Furthermore we point out that ˇ-KMS states are quasifree states and
fulﬁll the analytic microlocal spectrum condition [26], in particular they are analytic
Hadamard states.
It has been shown in [5] that the correlation functions
FA;B.x/ D !ˇ.A.1;x/.B//; x 2 R4
of ˇ-KMS states !ˇ on A.M/ have in fact stronger analyticity properties than those
implied by the KMS condition. These analyticity properties can be seen as a remnant
of the relativistic spectrum condition in the case of a thermal equilibrium state.
Deﬁnition 1.2 A state !ˇ on A.M/ satisﬁes the relativistic KMS condition at
inverse temperature ˇ > 0 iff there exists some eˇ 2 V1

The LTE Condition of Buchholz, Ojima and Roos
The ﬁrst key step in the analysis of Buchholz, Ojima and Roos in [10] is the
construction of spaces Qq of idealized observables (density-like quantities) located
at q 2 M. Those observables are well-deﬁned as quadratic forms and their
expectation values can be calculated in all states with an appropriate high-energy
behaviour. From the spaces Qq one then selects subspaces Sq  Qq of local thermal
observables s.q/. The thermal interpretation of these observables is justiﬁed by
evaluating them in thermal reference states. The set of these reference states is
denoted by CB and consists of mixtures of KMS states !ˇ, with ˇ contained in
some compact subset B  VC. A generic state !B 2 CB is represented in the form
!B.A/ D
Z
B
d	.ˇ/!ˇ.A/;
A 2 A.M/;

M. Gransee
where 	 is a positive normalized measure on VC, with support contained in B.
The connection between the local thermal observables from the spaces Sq and
the macroscopic thermal properties of a reference state is provided as follows: As
discussed explicitly in [7], the local observables s.q/ yield the same information on
the thermal properties of the reference states as certain macroscopic observables S,
namely for certain sequences fn 2 D.R4/ with fn % 1R4 the limit
S D lim
n!1 s.fn/
(12)
exists in all thermal reference states and deﬁnes a macroscopic (central) observable,
i.e. S is commuting with any element A 2 A as well as with the spacetime
translations .1;a/; a 2 R4. One assumes that all macroscopic intensive thermal
parameters of a ˇ-KMS state are given by maps ˇ 7! S.ˇ/ which are called
thermal functions. For any s.q/ 2 Sq we can deﬁne such functions by
ˇ 7! S.ˇ/ WD !ˇ.s.q//;
(13)
which are Lorentz tensors with the tensorial character depending on s.q/. Further-
more, as a consequence of spacetime translation invariance of the states !ˇ, they
do not depend on the speciﬁc choice of the point q 2 M. The thermal functions
yield the central decomposition of the macroscopic observables S [7]. Thus, we
can identify S with the respective thermal function S.ˇ/ and the states !B can be
lifted to the space of macroscopic observables via
!B.S/.q/ WD !B.s.q//;
s.q/ 2 Sq:
(14)
In the present model the spaces of thermal observables are deﬁned as the spaces
Sn
q, spanned by the so-called balanced derivatives of the Wick square up to order n.
Those are deﬁned as
Ä	1:::	n W 2 W .q/ WD

/.q  
//  1 ;
(15)
where !vac is the unique vacuum state on A.M/ and the limit is taken along
spacelike directions 
. Of particular interest is the space S2
q which contains (besides
the unit 1) two thermal observables which play a prominent role. The ﬁrst one is
W  W2 .q/, the Wick square of  at the point q 2 M, which is usually regarded as
corresponding to a point-like “thermometer observable” ‚.q/. This is due to the fact

that its evaluation in a ˇ-KMS state yields for the Klein-Gordon ﬁeld with m D 01:
‚.ˇ/ WD !ˇ.W 2 W .q// D

B
12T2:
(16)
The other thermal observable contained in S2
q is Ä	 W 2 W .q/, the second balanced
derivative of W 2 W .q/. It is of special interest since its expectation values in a ˇ-
KMS state !ˇ are (up to a constant) equal to the expectation values of the thermal
stress-energy tensor [10]:

	1 : : : @ˇ


ˇ21 :
(18)
This makes clear that the thermal functions S.n/.ˇ/ can be constructed completely
out of ˇ.2 Thus they can be viewed as thermal functions corresponding to the
micro-observables s.q/. Furthermore, due to the invariance of !ˇ under spacetime
translations, they are independent of q. Note, that for odd n the thermal functions
are equal to 0.
The deﬁnition of local thermal equilibrium in the sense of [7, 10] can now be
stated for the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld3 as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.1 Let O  M and ! a Hadamard state on A.M/.
(1) We say that ! is a local thermal equilibrium state of order N in O with sharp
inverse temperature vector ﬁeld ˇ.O/, or Œˇ.O/; N-LTE state for short, iff there

temperature distribution 	, or Œ	; O; N-LTE state for short, iff there exists a
1In the massive case the expression !ˇ.W 2 W .q// yields a slightly more complicated but still
monotonously decreasing function of ˇ.
2This is also true in the massive case. Here, the thermal functions are given by a more involved
expression which is analytic in ˇ [17].
3In [10] a deﬁnition has been given which is valid for more general quantum ﬁelds , also including
interacting ones.

function 	 W q 7! 	q; q 2 O, where each 	q is a probability measure with
support in some compact B.q/  VC, and for any q 2 O

where the states !B.q/; q 2 O are deﬁned by
!B.q/.A/ D
Z
B.q/
d	q.ˇ/!ˇ.A/;
A 2 A.M/:
(21)
We say that ! is a Œ	; O-LTE state iff (20) holds for all n 2 N.
It is obvious from this deﬁnition that any ˇ-KMS state !ˇ is a ˇ.M/-LTE state
with constant inverse temperature vector ﬁeld given by ˇ.q/  ˇ. Although this
should be the case for consistency reasons the noteworthy feature of the above
deﬁnition lies in the possibility of a varying inverse temperature vector ﬁeld ˇ,
so an LTE state can have varying inverse temperature ˇq (resp. inverse temperature
distribution 	q) as well as varying rest frame at each q 2 O.
It is known from special relativistic thermodynamics that all relevant macro-
scopic thermal parameters, in particular the entropy current density, for a (local)
equilibrium state can be constructed once the components of E	 are known
[12, Chapter 4]. This means that in order to gain knowledge about the coarse
macroscopic properties of (local) equilibrium states it is sufﬁcient to analyze them
by means of the subset S2
q of all thermal observables. For increasing n the spaces
Sn
q contain more and more elements, i.e. the higher balanced derivatives of W 2 W
.q/. Thus, the Œˇ.O/; N-LTE condition introduces a hierarchy among the local
equilibrium states in the following sense: If we successively increase the order N
in this condition we obtain an increasingly ﬁner resolution of the thermal properties
of this state. For ﬁnite N we obtain a measure of the deviation of the state ! from
complete local thermal equilibrium (which would amount to a ˇ.O/-LTE state).
An example of a ˇ.O/-LTE state on A.M/ (massless case), with O D VC, has
been given in [10]. It is a quasifree state !hb on A.M/, the so-called hot bang state
deﬁned via
!hb

(23)
where !ˇ.q/ is the unique extremal ˇ.q/-KMS state with ˇ.q/ D 2q; q 2 VC.
Thus, the state !hb in fact is a ˇ.VC/-LTE state in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1. It
describes the spacetime evolution of a “heat explosion” with inﬁnite temperature at
the tip of the forward lightcone VC which justiﬁes the name hot bang state. For a

Local Thermal Equilibrium States in Relativistic QFT
109
more thorough discussion of the properties of !hb we refer to the article by Buchholz
[7]. Below we will see that such a state is in fact the generic example of an inﬁnite-
order and sharp-temperature LTE state of the massless Klein-Gordon ﬁeld.

A Local Version of the KMS Condition
The LTE condition of [10] is based on the heuristic assumption that one should
be able to obtain information about the (macroscopic) thermal properties of near-
to-equilibrium states by comparing them pointwise to thermal reference states
(KMS states or mixtures of such) by means of localized thermal observables. In
the present model those observables were modelled by the Wick square W 2 W
.q/ and its balanced derivatives. This choice has been largely motivated by the
fact that the expectation value of the Wick square in equilibrium is proportional
to the square of the equilibrium temperature (i.e. temperature in the sense of
the 0th law of thermodynamics). It would clearly be desirable to give further
arguments for the special choice of the thermal observables in the free ﬁeld case.
A physical motivation, based on the investigation of the behaviour of moving
detectors modelled by quantum mechanical two-level systems (Unruh detectors),
has been given in [20]. On the mathematical side, in view of the deﬁnition of the
balanced derivatives of the Wick square, Eq.(15), one should be able to encode the
thermal properties of an LTE state ! on A.M/ directly on the level of the two-
point functions !2. This assumption is further strengthened by observing that the
correlation functions !ˇ
2 .q
; q˙
/ for a ˇ-KMS state are completely determined
by the expectation values !ˇ.Ä	1	n W 2 W .q// for all n 2 N, as discussed in [10].
In the following we will discuss a recent proposal by Gransee, Pinamonti and Verch
[14] for characterizing LTE states by properties of their two-point function !2 which
are similar to the KMS condition. It will turn out that under reasonable additional
analyticity requirements this characterization yields the class of Œˇ.O/; N-LTE
states, which were introduced in the previous section.
A ﬁrst observation in [14] is, that for any Hadamard state ! on A.M/ and any
q 2 M the “function” wq, given by
wq.
/ WD !2 .q  
; q C 
/ ;

 2 R4;
(24)
can be meaningfully deﬁned as a distribution in S0.R4/. In particular, for any
timelike future-pointing unit vector e 2 V1
C the “function” uq;e, deﬁned by
uq;e.t/ WD !2 .q  te; q C te/ ;
t 2 R;
(25)

110
M. Gransee
is well-deﬁned as a distribution in S0.R/. If !ˇ is a ˇ-KMS state on A.M/ it follows
from the spacetime translation invariance of such states that the distribution uˇ,
deﬁned by
uˇ.t/ WD !ˇ
2

q  teˇ; q C teˇ

(26)
is independent of the choice of the point q 2 M. The role of the parameter t is
enlightened by the following observation: If !ˇ is a ˇ-KMS state on A.M/, then for
arbitrary but ﬁxed q 2 M there is a complex function fˇ, holomorphic on the strip
Sˇ, with (distributional) boundary values
fˇ.t/ D !ˇ

q  teˇ; q C teˇ

and
fˇ.t Ciˇ/ D !ˇ


q C teˇ; q  teˇ

:
(27)
This is to be seen as a remnant of the KMS condition, in which the parameter t
plays the same role as the parameter of the one-parametric group of time evolution
on A.M/, and where the boundary value conditions (6) and (7) are replaced by the
weaker property (27) above. However, the above properties are surely not sufﬁcient
to imply the ˇ-KMS condition. The main point is that these properties are valid
with respect to an a priori ﬁxed point q 2 M and therefore do not tell us anything
about spacetime translation invariance of the state !ˇ. Furthermore, the knowledge
of the distribution uq 2 S0.R/ (which arises as the restriction of the distribution
wq 2 S0.R4/ to the set f
 2 R4 W 
 D teq; t 2 Rg) does not completely determine the
correlation functions !.q
; q˙
/ but only their restrictions to timelike arguments

. However, if one makes the additional assumption that the state ! fulﬁlls the
analytic Hadamard condition (5), one observes [14]:
Observation An analytic Hadamard state ! fulﬁlls the ˇ.q/-LTE condition if and
only if there exists a ˇ.q/ 2 VC such that

which is to be understood in the sense of distributions.
This shows that the ˇ.q/-LTE condition together with the analytic Hadamard
condition is sufﬁcient to determine the correlation functions !.q 

completely. As mentioned above, the respective correlation functions for the
comparison equilibrium state !ˇ.q/ are completely ﬁxed by the expectation values
!ˇ.q/.Ä	1:::	n W 2 W .q// for any q 2 O. This provides an additional justiﬁcation for
the use of the balanced derivatives as the thermal observables in the present model.
Analyzing the analyticity properties of the correlation functions wˇ.q/.

observation is used in [14] to relax the KMS condition as follows:
Deﬁnition 3.1 Let q 2 M and ! be an analytic Hadamard state on A.M/. We say

Let O be a spacetime region. We say that ! fulﬁlls the ˇ.O/-LKMS condition, iff
there exists a continuous (resp. smooth, if O is open) map ˇ W O ! B  VC such
that ! fulﬁlls the ˇ.q/-LKMS condition for all q 2 O.
Any ˇ-KMS state !ˇ is a ˇ.O/-LKMS state with O D M, where ˇq  ˇ
and eq  eˇ are constant throughout Minkowski spacetime. However, the natural
question arises if there are other examples of nontrivial LKMS states. We ﬁrst note
that the ˇ.q/-LKMS condition can be shown [14] to have an equivalent momentum-
space formulation: A state ! on A.M/ fulﬁlls the ˇ.q/-LKMS condition if and only
if there exists a ˇ.q/ D ˇqeq 2 VC, such that in the sense of distributions
Owq.p/ D eˇ.q/p Owq.p/;
(34)
and the cluster property (33) holds.
The relation (34) can be seen as a remnant of the ˇ-KMS condition in momentum
space [6]. With the deﬁnition (22) of the hot-bang state !hb one sees that the latter is
an example of a ˇ.O/-LKMS state with O D VC and ˇ.q/ D 2q. Thus, the local
KMS condition appears as a non-trivial generalization of the KMS condition. More
generally, relations (33) and (34) yield

This shows that the ˇ.q/-LKMS condition (in position or in momentum space) is
sufﬁcient to completely determine the correlation functions wq.
/. In consequence,
this proves:
Theorem 3.2 Let q 2 M and ! an analytic Hadamard state on A.M/. Then the
following are equivalent:
(i) ! is a ˇ.q/-LTE state.
(ii) ! fulﬁlls the ˇ.q/-LKMS condition.
LKMS and ﬁnite-order LTE states For LTE states of ﬁnite order (in the sense of
Deﬁnition 2.1) it seems to be clear that the relation (28) will not be valid exactly,
but that a similar relation might hold. Informally, in view of the deﬁnition of the
balanced derivatives (15), one would expect the following to hold: The directional
derivatives with respect to 
 of the correlation functions !.q 
; q ˙
/ at the point

 D 0 coincide with those of the respective correlation functions of a comparison
equilibrium state !ˇ.q/, up to order N.
Of course, from a mathematical point of view, this statement is meaningless,
because the correlation functions are distributions in S0.R4/ and it is not clear what
is meant by “the directional derivatives of !.q  
; q ˙ 
/ at the point 
 D 0”.
Nevertheless, one has a mathematically well-deﬁned version of the above informal
statement [14]:
Observation Let q 2 M. An analytic Hadamard state ! on A.M/ fulﬁlls the
Œˇ.q/; N-LTE condition if and only if there exists a ˇ.q/ 2 VC such that
Œ@˛.wˇ.q/  wq/.0/ D 0

where wˇ.q/.

This observation can be used to further generalize the ˇ.q/-LKMS condition:
Deﬁnition 3.3 Let q 2 M and N 2 N. An analytic Hadamard state ! on A.M/ is
said to fulﬁll the Œˇ.q/; N-LKMS condition iff there exists a ˇ.q/ 2 VC such that
there is a complex function Fq with the following properties:

This deﬁnition can also be generalized to open regions O of Minkowski
spacetime. An analogous analysis as for the ˇ.q/-LKMS condition shows that
the Œˇ.q/; N-LKMS condition is sufﬁcient to determine the correlation functions
!.q  
; q ˙ 
/, similar to (28), but only up to some real-analytic “rest term”
Rq W R4 ! R4. Without going into details, we want to state that this implies the
following result:
Theorem 3.4 Let q 2 M and ! an analytic Hadamard state on A.M/. Then the
following are equivalent:
(i) ! is a Œˇ.q/; N-LTE state.
(ii) ! fulﬁlls the Œˇ.q/; N-LKMS condition.
(iii) There exists a ˇ.q/ D ˇqeq 2 VC and a symmetric ORq 2 S0.R4/ with
FŒp˛ ORq.p/.0/ D 0

(44)
such that the cluster property (43) holds and we have in the sense of
distributions:
eˇ.q/p. Owq C ORq/.p/ D . Owq C ORq/.p/:
(45)
For a proof of Theorem 3.4 we again refer to [14].
Constraints from the Klein-Gordon equation A further interesting question is
the following: Given a Œˇ.O/; N-LKMS state for some (open) subset O, is the form
of the map ˇ W O ! VC completely arbitrary? Surely, this is not the case if the
comparison equilibrium states !ˇ.q/ ought to fulﬁll the (relativistic) KMS condition.
It turns out (cf. also [7, 17]) that the equations of motion for the ﬁeld  imply
dynamical constraints on the correlation functions wq.
/ which give restrictions
on the map ˇ. For the case of the massless Klein-Gordon ﬁeld on can prove the
following [14]:

114
M. Gransee
Proposition 3.5 Let !  M be an analytic Hadamard state on A.M/ which fulﬁlls
the ˇ.O/-LKMS condition. Then there exists b 2 R4 such that O  fVC  bg (resp.
O  fVC  bg) and
ˇ	.q/ D c!q	 C b	
8q 2 O;
(46)
where c! > 0 (resp. c! < 0) is a state-dependent constant.
If we exclude the somewhat unphysical case c! < 0 this makes clear that the hot-
bang state !hb, deﬁned by (22), is the generic example of a ˇ.O/-LKMS state.
Namely, the analytic Hadamard condition on a ˇ.O/-LKMS state ! implies that
wq D wˇ.q/ for all q 2 fVCbg and, in consequence, that ! fulﬁlls the ˇ.fVCbg/-
LKMS condition, with
ˇ	.q/ D c!q	 C b	
8q 2 fVC  bg:
(47)
The hot-bang state then corresponds to b D 0 and any other ˇ.O/-LKMS state
arises from !hb by ! D !hb ı .1;b/;
b 2 R4.
For the massive Klein-Gordon ﬁeld the situation is even more restrictive: In this
case it turns out that for !  M the only states which can fulﬁll the ˇ.O/-LKMS
condition are the states for which ˇ.q/ D const. for all q 2 O. The analytic
Hadamard condition on O then implies that ! has to be the unique ˇ-KMS state
!ˇ on A.M/. Thus, there are no nontrivial inﬁnite-order LTE states of the massive
Klein-Gordon ﬁeld.
LTE states with mixed temperature The above discussion implies that states of
the massive Klein-Gordon ﬁeld which are thermal in a subset O  M always have
to be mixed-temperature LTE states in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1, characterized
at each q 2 O by some probability measure 	q. In [17] Hübener succeeded in
constructing a speciﬁc example of a Œ	q; O-LTE state. Apart from this, one has the
following general existence result [10]:
Proposition 3.6 Let q 2 M. For every ﬁnite-dimensional subspace SN
q of all
thermal observables and any compact Bq  VC there exists a probability measure
	q, with support contained in Bq, and states ! on A.M/ which are Œ	q; N-thermal.
This result has been generalized by Solveen [23] as follows:
Proposition 3.7 Let O be a compact region of Minkowski spacetime. For every
ﬁnite-dimensional subspace SN
q of all thermal observables there exists a map 	 W
q 7! 	q; q 2 O, where 	q is a probability measure compactly supported in VC, and
states ! on A.M/ which are Œ	.O/; N-thermal.
In view of these existence results, it seems to be desirable to give an intrinsic
characterization of such states similar to the LKMS condition. Similar to the case of
sharp-temperature LTE states one observes the following [14]:
Observation Let q 2 M. An analytic Hadamard state ! on A.M/ fulﬁlls the
Œ	; fqg; N-LTE condition if and only if there exists a probability measure 	q with

Local Thermal Equilibrium States in Relativistic QFT
115
support in some compact B.q/  VC, such that
Œ@˛.wB.q/  wq/.0/ D 0
8˛ 2 f˛ 2 N4
0 W j˛j 	 Ng;
(48)
where wB.q/.
/ D
R
B.q/ d	q.ˇ/wˇ.
/.
Unfortunately, one immediately obtains that, although the distribution wB.q/ can be
extended to a holomorphic function on a subset of C4, it does not have periodicity
properties in the imaginary space-time variable, since the state !B.q/ does not fulﬁll
the KMS condition with respect to some ˇ 2 VC. However, there might be the
possibility to characterize such states by remnants of the so-called auto-correlation
inequalities, which yield another (equivalent) characterization of equilibrium states
in algebraic quantum statistical mechanics (see e.g. [4, Thm. 5.3.15 and Thm.
5.3.17]). This problem is currently under investigation.

Summary and Outlook
In this article we reviewed some aspects of local thermal equilibrium states in
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. The necessity to introduce such states arises since
one would like to describe the macroscopic properties of states in quantum ﬁeld
theory which are not global equilibrium (KMS) states, but locally still possess well-
deﬁned thermal parameters, like temperature and thermal stress-energy. For the
characterization of LTE states of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld on Minkowski
spacetime one has in principle two options. One could describe these states in
operational way, as it has been done in [10], which results in an (extrinsic) LTE
condition. On the other hand, one could aim at a more intrinsic characterization,
based on properties of correlation functions, in the spirit of the KMS condition. Such
a generalized KMS condition, called local KMS condition, has been introduced
in [14], and it turns out that, under additional (physically motivated) analyticity
assumptions on the two-point function, both approaches yield the same class of non-
equilibrium states of the quantized Klein-Gordon ﬁeld on Minkowski spacetime.
Finally, we want to mention that the concept of LTE states has also been
generalized to include quantum ﬁelds on a generic curved spacetime [11, 22, 24]
and some results concerning the thermal behaviour of quantum ﬁelds in cosmo-
logical spacetimes of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker type [28] have been established
[13, 18, 21]. For an overview and a more in-depth discussion of these results and
other results concerning LTE states in quantum ﬁeld theory, we refer the interested
reader to the exhaustive review article by Verch [27] and the references therein. It
clearly is a challenging task to try to generalize the results concering the LKMS
condition also to situations in which gravity is present, i.e. in which space-time is
curved.

“Towards the Mathematics of Quantum Field Theory” (Paugam F, Towards the
mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory. Springer, Cham, 2014), to which we refer for
the details of our work and a list of references. The main interest of our approach is
that it gives a clear mathematical status to the various “spaces of ﬁelds” that appear
in the treatment of general classical and quantum gauge theories.

Pure Yang-Mills and Derived Smooth Spaces
Before giving the basic deﬁnitions necessary to understand what derived smooth
spaces are, we will explain how they appear in an important and concrete physical
example.
Let .M; g/ be a metric variety and G a semisimple group, with Killing form
h; i W g  g ! R:
The conﬁguration space for the equations of motion is given by the moduli space
BunConG.M/ whose points are given by pairs .P; A/ with:
1. P a principal G-bundle on M,
2. A a principal G-connection on P.
The aim of classical mechanics is to minimize the action functional
S.P; A/ D
Z
M
FA ^ FA d	g
with some boundary values on a convenient domain. Here, FA is the connection’s
curvature form,  is the Hodge star operator associated to the metric g and d	g the
Riemannian measure.
We would like to see this action functional as a smooth function on a smooth
space BunConG.M/. In order to equip this space with a smooth structure, we may
ﬁrst see it as a diffeological space, i.e., a set-valued sheaf on the category OpenC1
of open subspaces of Rn for varying n.
Recall that the manifold M may itself be seen as such a sheaf
M W Openop
C1 ! SETS
deﬁned by M.U/ D HomC1.U; M/, i.e., by taking the functor of points of M
parametrized by smooth open sets. The central result of category theory, called
Yoneda’s lemma, essentially tells us that the manifold M is completely determined
by the functor M. It is a sheaf, meaning that one may paste uniquely parametrized
points of M, i.e., a family of morphisms fi W Ui ! M, along a covering U D [iUi
of an open set U, whenever the morphisms are equal on common intersections.
Similarly, the group G deﬁnes a sheaf
G W Openop
C1 ! GRP

Categorical Methods in Quantum Field Theory
121
with values in the category of groups.
Now we may deﬁne the space BunConG.M/ by using parametrized families of
principal G-bundles with principal G-connections. More precisely, we will describe
it as the sheaf of sets
BunConG.M/ W Openop
C1 ! SETS
that sends an open U  Rn to the set BunConG.M/.U/ of pairs .P; A/ where P is
a principal G-bundle on M  U (a family of principal bundles on M parametrized
by U) and A is a principal G-connection in P relative to U (i.e., a smooth family
of principal connections on the ﬁbers of P at points of U, which are principal G-
bundles on M).
Now comes an important point: we would like to see BunConG.M/ as a space
of ﬁelds, i.e., of functions on M with values in some space. However, this is not
possible in the setting of set-valued sheaves, because the natural parameter space
for principal G-bundles is the classifying stack BG associated to the group sheaf
G, that is deﬁned as the “homotopical sheaf” with values in groupoids (categories
whose only morphisms are isomorphisms)
BG W Openop
C1 ! GRPD;
that sends U to the groupoid BG.U/ with one object and morphisms given by
G.U/ D HomC1.U; G/. A difﬁculty in this approach is to deﬁne the sheaf
condition, because the category GRPD of groupoids should be considered as a 2-
category, with 2-morphisms given by natural transformations between functors.
Remark that there is a natural functor
N W GRPD ! SSETS
from groupoids to simplicial sets sending a groupoid to its simplicial nerve.
Concretely, if BG.U/ is the groupoid with one object and morphisms given by
G.U/ D HomC1.U; G/, then the associated nerve NBG.U/ is the simplicial set
obtained by setting NBG.U/n WD G.U/n1, and the simplicial maps are given by
multiplication in G.U/ and insertions of units. By composing the functor BG with
the nerve functor we get a functor
NBG W Openop
C1 ! SSETS:
The “homotopical sheaf” associated to this functor is called the classifying 1-stack
(still denoted BG) of G. A similar but more complicated stack BGconn also exists
that classiﬁes parametrized families of pairs .P; A/ as above.
We may then deﬁne a new stack still denoted BunConG.M/ as the mapping stack
BunConG.M/ WD Hom.M; BGconn/:

122
F. Paugam
Its points parametrized by an open subset U  Rn are essentially given by the
(simplicial nerve of the) groupoid of isomorphisms of principal G-bundles with
principal connections.
The original formula for our action functional applied to parametrized families
of bundles with principal G-connections gives a functional
S W BunConG.M/ ! R;
where R.U/ D Hom.U; R/.
The usual critical space Crit.S/ D f.P; A/; dS.P;A/ D 0g for this action functional
is the space of solutions of the Yang-Mills equations. If X D BunConG.M/ would
be a usual smooth manifold, one may think of the critical space as the intersection
Crit.S/ D Im.dS/ \ T
X X  TX
of the image of the differential of S with the zero section of the cotangent bundle of
X. In general, this intersection is ill-behaved, and looks like being non-transversal,
so that one has to replace the critical space Crit.S/ by the derived intersection
RCrit.S/ D Im.dS/
h
TX T
X X:
One cannot deﬁne such a derived smooth space using only open subsets of Rn as
parameters: one has to deﬁne a new category of parameters, that contains open
subsets but also homotopical inﬁnitesimal extensions of them.
The extension of the category OpenC1 to a bigger category of derived smooth
opens is given by a procedure very similar to the one used to deﬁne diffeological
spaces and smooth 1-stacks: every open set U deﬁnes a functor of functions
C1.U/ W OpenC1 ! SETS
deﬁned by C1.U/.V/ WD HomC1.U; V/. This functor commutes with products,
and sends pullbacks along open inclusions V  W to pullbacks. One may think of
these two conditions as covariant analogs of the sheaf condition. We will thus deﬁne
a general smooth algebra A as a functor
A W OpenC1 ! SETS
that commutes with products and the sends pullbacks along open inclusions V 
W to pullbacks. With this formulation, it is very easy to give a homotopical
generalization of the notion of open subset U  Rn: it is given by the notion of
a homotopy smooth algebra A, that is a functor
A W OpenC1 ! SSETS

Categorical Methods in Quantum Field Theory
123
that commute homotopically to products and pullbacks along open immersions.
We denote ALGh
C1 the (higher) category of such homotopy smooth algebras. It is
possible, if G is a classical real group, to extend the classifying space of G to a
(homotopy) functor
BG W ALGh
C1 ! SSETS
on this category of homotopy smooth algebras with values in simplicial sets. Indeed,
the sum and product operations C W R  R ! R and  W R  R ! R are smooth
functions, so that one may use them to deﬁne a sum and product on A.R/, that makes
it a real (homotopy) algebra, and one then deﬁnes G.A/ as G.A.R/; C; /. We may
then, with some more work, deﬁne the derived moduli space of principal bundles
with connections BGconn, and get a derived moduli space
RBunConnG.M/ WD RHom.M; BGconn/ W ALGh
C1 ! SSETS:
It still carries the Yang-Mills action functional

new space is equipped with a natural (shifted) symplectic form !, that one may
try to quantize using deformation quantization or functional integral methods. This
symplectic form may be thought of as an analog of the Peierls bracket, in the case
of a theory with gauge invariance.

Functorial Geometry and Analysis
We will now give more precise mathematical deﬁnitions for the objects considered
in the previous chapter.

2.1
Yoneda and the Completion of Categories
Let LEGOS denote a category of simple building blocks for a given geometry (e.g.,
the category OpenC1 of smooth open subsets U  Rn). In general, the category
LEGOS have important drawbacks:
1. It does not have enough limits (e.g., solutions of equations, ﬁber products).
2. It does not have enough colimits (e.g., quotients by group actions).
3. It does not contain “spaces of ﬁelds”, i.e., functional spaces Hom.U; V/.
The solution to these problems was found and used by Grothendieck, Lawvere and
Ehresmann in the sities: one may use the Yoneda embeddings
LEGOS ,! Hom.LEGOSop; SETS/ and LEGOSop ,! Hom.LEGOS; SETS/
that send a building block U to the set-valued functor of points U D Hom.; U/
or the functor of functions O.U/ WD Hom.U; /. Yoneda’s lemma tells us that the
above functors are indeed embeddings, and the main interest of the target categories
is that they have arbitrary limits and colimits.
The main interest of this functorial approach to geometry is that it generalizes to
homotopical situations, that are necessary to treat obstructions in a geometric way
(stacks and derived stacks).
To get sensible generalizations of our building blocs, we want to be able to paste
functors of points, and to take tensor products of functors of functions. This is done
by the following method:
1. In the functional approach, one deﬁnes a generalized algebra to be a functor of
functions
A W LEGOS ! SETS
that commutes with ﬁnite products and sends pullbacks along open embeddings
to pullbacks. For example
C1.M/ W U 7! C1.M; U/
fulﬁlls these conditions.
2. In the punctual approach, one deﬁnes a generalized space to be a functor of points
X W LEGOSop ! SETS
that commutes with pasting of open subsets. For example,
M W U 7! C1.U; M/
fulﬁlls these conditions.

Categorical Methods in Quantum Field Theory
125
One has by deﬁnition the right tensor product (no need for completion) for
generalized algebras
C1.U  V/ Š C1.U/ ˝ C1.V/;
and the right covering properties or generalized spaces
U
a
U\V
V Š U
a
U\V
V:
This allows us to deﬁne a manifold M as a functor of point
M W LEGOSop ! SETS
that is a sheaf (i.e., respects pastings) and is equal to the colimit of its representable
open subsets i W U ! M. Every open subset U deﬁnes a manifold U, and one
may use pasting to deﬁne general manifolds from these basic building blocks. The
main output of the punctual approach is that it allows the deﬁnition of interesting
spaces of ﬁelds Hom.M; N/ given by smooth spaces of functions between two given
manifolds.
In the functional setting, one may deﬁne ﬁnitely presented rings as functors of
functions A that are the coequalizer of two morphisms f; g W C1.U/ ! C1.V/
between the functor of function of two smooth open subsets. These correspond
to formal solution spaces fx 2 V; f.x/ D g.x/g for the equations given by the
corresponding smooth functions f; g W V ! U. This allows the deﬁnition of smooth
algebras with nilpotents, such as C1.R/=.x2 D 0/, that play an important role
in the geometric formalization of inﬁnitesimal smooth calculus (called synthetic
differential geometry).
Usually, one uses a combination of the functional and the punctual approach,
by taking functors of points on functors of functions, to get both inﬁnitesimal and
functional spaces.
2.2
Functorial Analysis
The jump in abstraction that we have done to do functorial geometry seems to have
taken us far from the usual tools of analysis. We will now explain that using functors
of points is actually compatible with more classical analysis, if one takes the care of
translating things in this new language.
Recall ﬁrst that the inversion map
inv W R ! R
x 7! 1=x

126
F. Paugam
is a partially deﬁned function whose deﬁnition domain may be computed. We
will work with a very general notion of function, and hide the analytic aspects
in deﬁnition domains. The main interest of this approach is that it gives a clear
separation between analytic aspects and geometry, that allows supergeometric and
graded generalizations.
Let C be an ambient category, e.g., C D SETS or Hom.LEGOSop; SETS/. Deﬁne
a span f W X ! Y to be a morphism
Rf ! X  Y:
A partial function f W X ! Y is a span Rf such that Rf ! X is a monomorphism
(with image the domain of deﬁnition Df )
Let us look at this general notion by using as a toy model the notion of distri-
bution. We will work with the parametrized space of functions X D Hom.R; R/,
deﬁned by
X.U/ D HomC1.R  U; R/;
and denote R.U/ WD HomC1.U; R/.
If f 2 L1.R/ is an integrable function, we have a partial function (i.e. natural
transformation)

whose deﬁnition domain is given by Lebesgue domination condition

The work of the analyst is to ﬁnd a common deﬁnition domain for an interesting big
class of functionals. One may now actually deﬁne a distribution as a (partial) linear
function f W X ! R whose deﬁnition domain contains

2.3
The Critical Space
Now let us consider a variational problem, that is given by the datum of a space M
of parameters, a space C of conﬁgurations, and a projection  W C ! M, together
with a subspace H  .M; C/ of the space of possible trajectories, called the space
of histories, and an action functional S W H ! R.

Categorical Methods in Quantum Field Theory
127
The main object of interest in classical mechanics is the critical space:
Crit.S/ D f' 2 Hj d'S D 0g;
where S is the action functional (partially) deﬁned by the formula
S W H.U/ ! R.U/ WD C1.U/

Remark that if H D .M; C/, one gets by integration by parts natural boundary
conditions H0  H such that CritjH0 is the Euler-Lagrange partial differential
equation.
Let us look at the simple example of Newtonian mechanics. Let M D Œ0; 1 and
C D M  R3, ﬁx x0; x1 2 C and Ev0; Ev1 2 R3 the starting and ending directions. This
deﬁnes a space of histories H. The action functional of a free particle is

2.4
Homotopical Geometry
As explained on the example of the pure Yang-Mills formalism, it is necessary for
applications to consider also homotopy functors of points and homotopy functors of
functions. We will not explain here the full theory but just how one may think of it
in analogy with what we have said before.
The main tool in these homotopical generalization is given by the homotopy
category of simplicial sets SSETS. A simplicial set is a contravariant functor
X W op ! SETS
on the category  whose objects are ﬁnite ordered non-empty sets Œn D f0; : : : ; ng
and whose morphisms are increasing maps. Such an objects is completely deter-
mined by the family of sets X.Œn/ and by the additional datum of degeneracy and
face maps. The category SSETS is actually a homotopy category (also called 1-
category), in which there is a nice notion of homotopy (derived) ﬁber product and
of derived morphism space RHom.X; Y/ 2 SSETS.
One may extend the Yoneda embeddings of our category LEGOS of building
blocks for a geometry to Yoneda embeddings
LEGOS ! Hom.LEGOSop; SSETS/ and LEGOSop ! Hom.LEGOSop; SSETS/;
where Hom denotes the homotopy category of homotopy functors. We then deﬁne
homotopy algebras (aka derived algebras) as functors
A W LEGOS ! SSETS

Categorical Methods in Quantum Field Theory
129
that commute homotopically to ﬁnite products and open ﬁber products, and
homotopy spaces (aka stacks) as functors
X W LEGOSop ! SSETS
that commute homotopically to nerves of coverings. One may also deﬁne derived
homotopy spaces as functors
X W ALGh
LEGOS ! SSETS
on homotopy algebras that commute homotopically to nerves of (hyper-)coverings.
3
D-Geometry and Variational Calculus
An important difﬁculty that appears in the above formulation of variational calculus
is that the spaces we are working with are inﬁnite dimensional, so that there is not
good duality between differential forms and tangent vectors. The physicists way
of solving this problem is to work only with local quantities, which means, spaces
deﬁned by systems of non-linear partial differential equations. We will now explain
how these methods can also be formulated in a functorial way.
3.1
D-Spaces and Non-linear PDEs
If M is a smooth manifold, we denote O D OM its sheaf of smooth functions,
D D DM the sheaf of local endomorphisms
D W OM ! OM
of OM generated by OM and by the OM-module ‚M of derivations.
We will describe linear partial differential systems on M as D-modules and
(algebraic) non-linear partial differential systems on M as D-algebras. This gives
a coordinate-free treatment of both notions.
A D-algebra is a D-module A together with an O-algebra structure such that
multiplication fulﬁlls Leibniz’s rule with respect to derivations @ 2 ‚M, i.e., we
have
@. fg/ D @fg C f@g:
We denote ALGD the category of D-algebras on M. If F.x; u˛/ D 0 is an algebraic
partial differential equation on a locally trivial (non-linear) bundle C ! M, its

130
F. Paugam
solution space may be computed in every D-algebra A containing the dependent
variable u. This deﬁnes a functor
SolFD0.A/ WD fu 2 A; F.x; u˛/ D 0g:
This functor is a sheaf on ALGD with respect to its natural topology, and we will
deﬁne a general D-space to be such a sheaf
F W .ALGD/op ! SETS:
There is a very rich geometry for such spaces, that is more complicated than the
smooth geometry we have explained before, because of the fact that D is a non-
commutative ring.
The solution space SolFD0 is representable by the D-algebra Jet.OC/=.F/, i.e.,
there is a natural isomorphism
SolFD0./ Š HomALGD.Jet.OC/=.F/; /:
3.2
Variational Calculus
If A is a D-algebra, we now denote
DR.A/ WD n
M
L˝D A:
This is the de Rham cohomology of the given D-algebra.
There is a natural integration pairing between H;c.M/ and h.DR.A// with
values in differential forms on the smooth space .M; C/ of sections of the given
bundle. We deﬁne local functionals as elements in
h.A/ WD h0.DR.A//:
These cohomology classes represent true functionals of the form
S.'/ D
Z
M
L.x; '.x/; @˛'.x//dx:
The advantage of the cohomological formulation is that it allows to do all compu-
tations purely in differential terms, à la Lagrange. In particular, we can deﬁne the
Euler-Lagrange equation purely algebraically by the following recipe.

Categorical Methods in Quantum Field Theory
131
Let A WD Jet.OC/ be the algebra of coordinates on the jet space of the given
bundle C ! M. Let d W A ! 1
A be the universal D-derivation on A, and denote
‚A WD HomAŒD.1
A; AŒD/:
Remark that we have used D-duality, and not only A-duality. This is what makes
D-geometry and its differential calculus a bit more intricate than usual differential
calculus on smooth manifolds. Still, there is an interior product map
idS W ‚`
A ! A
with ‚`
A WD n ˝O ‚A is the left D-module associated to the right D-module of
local vector ﬁeld densities ‚A. If we denote IS WD im.idS/ the critical D-ideal in
A, given by the image of the interior product map, the critical space is given by the
Euler-Lagrange D-space
CritD.S/ D Spec.A=IS/:
This is a D-space over M whose solution space (if one chooses nice boundary
conditions for the action functional) is given by the smooth critical space Crit.S/
that we have already described before.
Remark that we have also a differential graded (derived) D-space called the
derived critical space
RCrit.S/ D RSpecD.SymAdg.‚`
A
idS
! A//:
It is a homotopy sheaf (stack) on the category of differential graded D-algebras on
M with values in the 1-category SSETS of simplicial sets. The nice property of
this derived space is that it always has a Poisson structure, given by the action of
derivations on A and the Lie bracket on derivations (Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket).

Homotopical Poisson Reduction of Gauge Theories
Now we arrive to the functorial D-geometric formulation of the standard method
used by physicists to prepare a gauge system for being quantized, called the Batalin-
Vilkovisky formalism.
An intrinsic deﬁnition of gauge symmetries may be given by setting
hS WD ‚Crit.S/=RCrit.S/;
where Crit.S/ ! RCrit.S/ is the natural inclusion, that we may think of as a the
inclusion of the critical space into its homotopy tubular neighborhood. This gives a

132
F. Paugam
natural homotopy Lie algebra structure on hS. Suppose we may choose a retraction
r W RCrit.S/ ! Crit.S/ such that
gS WD ‚RCrit.S/=Crit.S/ ! ‚RCrit.S/
induces an Hamiltonian ﬂow on the Poisson (actually odd symplectic) D-space
RCrit.S/. This will be called a Hamiltonian retraction. Then we may deﬁne the
homotopical Poisson reduction as the Poisson reduction of the derived critical space
by this Hamiltonian action. This essentially corresponds to the following more
explicit construction.

To quantize, on needs to ﬁx a (derived) Lagrangian in the odd Poisson BV space

necessary to its validity.

In our book, we also give a detailed and geometric construction, using functors of
points, of the gauge ﬁxing procedure, in full generality. Our main motivation is to
better understand perturbative quantization à la Epstein-Gläser in chiral algebras
using microlocal analysis.
5
Quantizing Gauge Theories
The output of the homotopical Poisson reduction of gauge theories, also called the
Batalin-Vilkoviski formalism, is a derived Poisson D-space XBV over the parameter
manifold M, whose functions correspond, in the physicists’ language, to local
functionals in the ﬁelds and antiﬁelds variables. There are now various ways to
formalize mathematically what it means to quantize this Poisson D-space.
5.1
The Deformation Quantization Approach
The most natural approach to quantize the Batalin-Vilkovisky space, from the
point of view of derived D-geometry, is given by the setting of Chiral algebras
and factorization spaces, that is a geometric formulation of the physical notion of
operator product expansion: using multijets instead of jets, one may extend the
derived D-space XBV to a D-space XRan
BV on the Ran (conﬁguration) space, that is
deﬁned by
Ran.M/ WD colimIJMI
where the colimit is taken along diagonals ./ W MJ ! MI associated to
surjections  W I  J of ﬁnite sets. One may think of XRan
BV as a space that encodes
power series expansions along ﬁeld derivatives at multiple points, in a way similar
to the way the jet space encodes power series expansions along ﬁeld derivatives at
points.
The operation
union W Ran.M/  Ran.M/ ! Ran.M/
of union of subsets and
j W .Ran.M/  Ran.M//disj ! Ran.M/  Ran.M/
of inclusion of disjoint pairs induce a chiral monoidal structure on D-modules on
Ran.M/ given by
˝ch WD unionjj.  /:

134
F. Paugam
One may show that the algebra of functions on XRan
BV deﬁnes a Lie algebra in
the category of D-modules on Ran.M/ for the chiral monoidal structure, that is
commutative, in some sense. The quantization problem is then to deform this Lie
algebra structure to a non-commutative one with associated semi-classical bracket
the given Poisson bracket on XBV.
Let us illustrate this in the simple case of a particle depending only on a time
variable in M D R. A chiral Lie algebra on R is simply an associative algebra, and
it is commutative if and only if the associative algebra is commutative. So in this
one parameter case, the aim of quantization is to deform a commutative algebra to
an associative one.
One may also understand the deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds in
this setting by using chiral algebras on the (compactiﬁed) Poincaré Half place
NH WD fz 2 Z; Im.z/  0g:
Indeed, every Poisson manifold .X; f; g/ deﬁnes a ﬁeld theory on NH called the
Poisson sigma model. By quantizing it by deformation, one gets a chiral algebra on
NH that may be pulled back to the real line R, to get an associative algebra that will
be the deformation quantization of the given Poisson manifold.
If we want to get to a more physical setting, we may start with a global hyperbolic
spacetimes M D R  M0. The quantization of the Batalin-Vilkovisky space of a
classical gauge theory on M would give a chiral algebra on M (i.e., a Lie algebra for
the chiral structure in D-modules on Ran.M/ supported on M) whose pullback on
R  fx0g will be a chiral algebra on R, that is known to be an associative algebra.
Now if we ﬁx time t0 and pullback the given chiral algebra on ft0g  M0, we get
a chiral algebra on M0, that is known to be, if M0 Š R3, an E3-algebra (aka 3-
associative homotopy algebra). This additional information (an actually the full 4-
dimensional chiral algebra structure) should be thought of as an algebraic analog of
the physicists’ operator product expansion.
5.2
Relation with Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Another approach to the quantization of the Batalin-Vilkovisky D-space of ﬁelds is
given by the causal approach of Epstein-Glaser-Brunetti-Fredenhagen. One needs
for this to develop a gauge ﬁxing procedure, which starts by giving the additional
datum of a Batalin-Vilkovisky graded bundle EBV over M whose sections correspond
the additional ﬁelds. We now work with graded spaces, whose building blocks are
algebras of the form .U; Sym.V// for V a graded bundle on an open subset U of
Rn.
The Batalin-Vilkovisky function Scm then gives a degree 0 functional
Scm W .M; EBV/ ! R:

Categorical Methods in Quantum Field Theory
135
One then needs to ﬁx the gauge, by using a Lagrangian D-subspace Xﬁelds of the
space XBV, represented by another bundle Eﬁelds on M and a morphism
L D .M; Eﬁelds/ ! .M; EBV/:
The composition of this map with the Batalin-Vilkovisky functional gives the so-
called gauge-ﬁxed action
Sgf W L D .M; Eﬁelds/ ! R;
and one should suppose that it is non-degenerate. In the free ﬁeld case, this means
that one may invert the corresponding linear differential operator, or at least, ﬁnd a
parametrix for it.
This action functional is now the one that should be used for the perturbative
approach to quantum ﬁeld theory, using functional integrals. For this, one needs
to decompose the local gauge ﬁxed action functional as a sum of a free part and
an interaction part with a small parameter, and write formal Gaussian integrals
associated to it. This leads to the renormalization problem. The renormalization
theory may then be formalized mathematically using the Epstein-Glaser formalism,
developed further by Brunetti-Fredenhagen and Rejzner (in the case of gauge
theories).

Abstract We review a sequence of papers in which we show that the quartic
matrix model with an external matrix is exactly solvable in terms of the solution
of a non-linear integral equation. The interacting scalar model on four-dimensional
Moyal space is of this type, and our solution leads to the construction of Schwinger
functions. Taking a special limit leads to a QFT on R4 which satisﬁes growth
property, covariance and symmetry. There is numerical evidence for reﬂection
positivity of the 2-point function for a certain range of the coupling constant.

Prehistory
In December 1999, Minwalla, van Raamsdonk and Seiberg demonstrated [31]
that quantum ﬁeld theories on noncommutative spaces, although nice at one-loop
order [26, 30], generate a severe problem in higher loops (UV/IR-mixing). The
mechanism was thoroughly analysed in two papers by Chepelev and Roiban [6, 7].
In summer 2002 we started a ﬁnal attempt to make sense of noncommutative
quantum ﬁeld theories. Quantum ﬁeld theory involves delicate limiting procedures
and it was not completely clear that the manipulations of oscillating integrals
are mathematically justiﬁed. A prerequisite to rigorous quantum ﬁeld theory is to
put the model into ﬁnite volume and to restrict it to ﬁnite energy. Inspired by
a discussion with Thomas Krajewski, we tried to analyse the Moyal models in
analogy to Polchinski’s renormalisation proof [35] of the 4
4-model using exact
renormalisation group equations. This approach has clear infrared and ultraviolet
cut-offs and proves rigorous bounds for the amplitude of Feynman graphs. All this
fails for oscillating integrals. The programme was rescued thanks to a hint by José
Gracia-Bondía who introduced us to his work [12, 42] on the matrix basis of the
Moyal space. We brieﬂy collect the most relevant results.
The Moyal plane is the space of Schwartz class functions equipped with the

for a certain integral kernel klImn of the Laplace operator. Angular momentum
conservation restricts to ıkiCmi;liCni. Then in both pairs kn and ml the kernel is, in
two dimensions, a tri-diagonal band matrix, in general a sum of local interaction
 ılmıkn plus nearest neighbour interaction ıki;mi˙1. To obtain Feynman rules we
must invert the kernel operator klImn and then introduce a cut-off. This was ﬁrst
done with a computer and small matrix cut-off N. We found that the graphs do not
behave well, for a surprising reason. The local part of klImn was ﬁne, but this was
destroyed by the nearest-neighbour terms. In December 2002 we came up with the
following working hypothesis: Let us scale the nearest neighbours down by a factor
< 1. Then everything worked (for the computer).
We asked ourselves what operator on x-space corresponds to the weakened
nearest neighbours. The answer is: an additional harmonic oscillator potential

A few remarks:
•
Translation invariance is explicitly broken. This will be repaired in the next
sections. On the other hand, the action is covariant under a duality found by
Langmann and Szabo [28]. This duality consists in exchanging the function and
its Fourier transform .x/ $ O.p/, position and momentum 2‚1x $ p and
then in reverting to the old variables by a modiﬁed Fourier transform with alter-
nating ˙i in the phase. This transform leaves the interaction

With some effort one can show [15] that all planar graphs with >4 external
legs and all non-planar graphs (amplitude  n) are ﬁnite. But this is not
enough, we need the analogue of locality. For instance, in the effective action
we get contributions to the 2-point function P GklImnˆklˆmn with (up to angular
momentum conservation) any k; l; m; n. But for renormalisability only the local
terms and the nearest-neighbour terms are allowed to diverge, and a single
subtraction at vanishing indices must remove the divergence. This turned out
to be true. A key step in the proof was an exact diagonalisation of the klImn-
kernel via Meixner polynomials. These are expressed in terms of hypergeometric
functions so that we were able to control the non-local terms.
During a visit of ESI early 2004 we computed the one-loop ˇ-function of that
model. We got explicit formulae, expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions,
showing that both  and  ﬂow, that ˇ D N d
dN is positive but vanishes at  D 1
[14]. At the end of a presentation of these results in Marseille, David Broadhurst
pointed out a remarkable coincidence with these formulae: The ﬂow is such that 2

remains constant! Since  ﬂows into its ﬁxed point 1 D 1, the running coupling
constant stays bounded over all scales, with ﬁnite 1 D
0
2
0 . There is no Landau
ghost [17]!
Shortly later, one of us (RW) had the chance to explain these results to Vincent
Rivasseau who visited the MPI Leipzig. A simple model without Landau ghost
was something he searched for long time. So we started a collaboration with the
aim to construct this model non-perturbatively [36]. Vincent Rivasseau infected
his scientiﬁc environment with this idea: Jacques Magnen, Margherita Disertori,
Jean-Christophe Wallet and a growing number of young people: Fabien Vignes-
Tourneret, Razvan Gurau, Adrian Tanasa, Zhituo Wang, Axel de Goursac and in

A Solvable Four-Dimensional QFT

some parts also Thomas Krajewski. There was a ﬁrst joint publication on multiscale
analysis [38], but then Rivasseau’s group was much faster: they reproved the
renormalisation theorem in position space [23], derived the Symanzik polynomials
[22], extended the method to the Gross-Neveu model [43] and so on [37].
The most important achievement started with a remarkable three-loop computa-
tion of the ˇ-function by Margherita Disertori and Vincent Rivasseau [8] in which
they conﬁrmed that at  D 1, ˇ vanishes to three-loop order. The great idea was to
work in the matrix basis but take advantage of the fact that the -kernel is local for
 D 1. Eventually, M. Disertori, R. Gurau, J. Magnen and V. Rivasseau proved
in [9] that the ˇ-function vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory. The key
step consists in an ingenious combination of Ward identities with Schwinger-Dyson
equation which they borrowed from a work of Benfatto and Mastropietro [1] on
one-dimensional Fermi systems.
We felt that the result of [9] goes much deeper: Using these tools it must be
possible to solve the model!

Details of the Solution
2.1
Reformulation as Matrix Model
We follow the Euclidean approach, starting from a partition function with source
term ZŒJ, which itself involves the action functional of the model. For concreteness,
let us look at the 4

It is absolutely crucial that, as in any rigorous construction, this action functional
cannot be taken as the naïve action SŒ. We have to regularise the action, namely
to place it into ﬁnite volume V and introduce an energy cut-off ƒ. These must be
removed in the very end to restore symmetry. For V ! 1 we study the free energy
density 1
V log.ZŒJ/ and functions derived from that. The limit 1
ƒ ! 0 is achieved by
the renormalisation philosophy. There is a renormalisation group ﬂow of effective
actions down in ƒ, and the key step is to impose mixed boundary conditions: ﬁnitely
many relevant and marginal couplings are ﬁxed at ƒR D 0, the inﬁnitely many
irrelevant couplings at ƒ ! 1. This involves an inversion of the renormalisation
group ﬂow which typically requires perturbation theory.
Finite volume is actually a compactiﬁcation of the underlying geometry. A more
sophisticated method than putting the model into a box is to add in (11) a harmonic
oscillator potential  7! H WD C!2kxk2. The result is the same, the resolvent
.H C i/1 is a compact operator (with discrete spectrum), and the D-dimensional
spectral volume is proportional to ! D
2 .

142
H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar
A well-known restriction of the energy density consists in introducing a lattice
of spacing a D
1
ƒ. This is the heart of the lattice gauge theory approach [46] to
quantum chromodynamics. As action one takes, for example, Wilson’s plaquette
action, which is non-local but converges for a ! 0 to the local Yang-Mills action.
We choose the Moyal product as our preferred non-locality:

This action is used to deﬁne the partition function. We should perform the
renormalisation and then take the limits N ! 1,  ! 0 and  ! 0 to rigorously
deﬁne the 4
4-model. This is not what we do; we take  D 1. At ﬁrst sight, this
cuts all ties to translation invariance. The only chance to kill the oscillator potential
for  D 1 is to let  ! 1. This is a highly singular limit in (1), although already
mentioned in [31] as ‘stringy’. We were able to make sense of this limit ﬁrst for
matrices [18] but later in position space [20], and surprisingly it not only restores
translation invariance but also full rotation invariance.

We can always choose an orthonormal basis where E is diagonal (but J is not). Since
E is of compact resolvent, E has eigenvalues Ea > 0 of ﬁnite multiplicity 	a. We
thus label the matrices by an enumeration of the (necessarily discrete) eigenvalues

The compactness of the resolvent of E implies that at the expense of adding a

In a perturbative expansion, Feynman graphs in matrix models are ribbon
graphs. Viewed as simplicial complexes, they encode the topology .B; g/ of a
genus-g Riemann surface with B boundary components. The kth boundary face is

144
H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar
characterised by Nk  1 external double lines to which we attach the source matrices
J. See e.g. [15]. Since E is diagonal, the matrix index is conserved along each strand
of the ribbon graph. Therefore, the right index of Jab coincides with the left index
of another Jbc, or of the same Jbb. Accordingly, the kth boundary component carries
a cycle Jp1:::pNk WD QNk

We stress that these weight functions Gjp1

NB j constitute the QFT;
we construct these functions rigorously and not a measure. The formal relation
to the partition function gives identities (Ward + Schwinger-Dyson) between the
weight functions. These identities, whenever deﬁned, are used to extend the weight
functions into regions for parameters where the measure does not exist. In the very
end, QFT is understood in terms of Schwinger or Wightman functions and scattering
amplitudes, not in terms of a measure.
Now comes the crucial step for the construction of the weight functions. We
turn the Ward identity (17) into a formula for the second derivative P

Formula (19) is the core of our approach. It is a consequence of the unitary group
action and the cycle structure of the partition function. The importance lies in the
fact that the formula allows to kill two J-derivatives in the partition function. As we
describe below, this is the key step in breaking up the tower of Schwinger-Dyson
equations.

reasonable limits which take (22b) and (22c) into account, similar to the double

here a non-trivial topology survives: The higher boundary components B  2 are not
suppressed; and in fact these contributions from B  2 make the model interesting!
By similar calculation we derive the Schwinger-Dyson equation for higher N-

The self-consistency equation (24a) was ﬁrst obtained in [19] for the Moyal model
by the graphical method proposed by [9]. There we also solved the renormalisation
problem resulting from the divergent summation P
p2I. The non-linearity of (24a)
was a considerable challenge which we successfully addressed in [18, 21].
The other topological sectors B  2 made of (N1C : : : CNB)-point functions

148
H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar
2-point function these equations are linear. The other functions with one Ni  3 are
purely algebraic.
We make the following key observation: An afﬁne transformation E 7! ZE C C
together with a corresponding rescaling 4 7! Z24 leaves the algebraic equations
invariant:
Theorem 2.4 Given a real quartic matrix model with S D V tr.Eˆ2 C 4

1. are ﬁnite without further need of a renormalisation of , i.e. all renormalisable
quartic matrix models have vanishing ˇ-function,
2. are given by universal algebraic recursion formulae in terms of renormalised
basic functions with Ni 	 2.
The theorem tells us that vanishing of the ˇ-function for the self-dual ˆ4
4-model
on Moyal space (proved in [9] to all orders in perturbation theory) is generic to all
quartic matrix models, and the result even holds non-perturbatively!
We remark that the algebraic equations for Ni  3 have a graphical realisation
in terms of non-crossing chord diagrams with additional decoration which describe
the denominators
1
EbiEbj . The different chord structures are counted by the Catalan
numbers. These functions alone would make the higher N-point functions very close
to trivial. It is the inclusion of the .2C2C : : : C2/-point functions which gives a rich
structure.
2.4
Inﬁnite Volume Limit and Renormalisation
We return to the Moyal-space regularisation of the 4
4-model. We know that the
unrenormalised 2-point function Gjabj satisﬁes the self-consistency equation (24a)
for Em D Z

and 4 D Z2. Because of the vanishing ˇ-function
(Theorem 2.4), there is no need to introduce a bare coupling bare. The matrix
indices have ranges a;    2 I WD N2
N , i.e. pairs of natural numbers with certain
cut-off. The index sum diverges for N2
N 7! N2.
It is important that all functions only depend on the spectrum of Em, i.e.
on the norms jmj D m1 C m2 and not on m1; m2 separately. It turns out that
also renormalisation respects this degeneracy. Therefore, all index sums reduce to

We stress that this procedure would be completely wrong for other models. Renor-
malisation is a recursive procedure [3, 24, 47] which has to take subdivergences
into account. Of course our 4-point subfunctions diverge, but these divergences
are exactly cancelled by the divergent vertex factors .Z2/ because ˇ is zero. So
there only remain divergent 2-point subfunctions, but inductively they are already
renormalised. In conclusion, ˇ D 0 permits a non-perturbative renormalisation
prescription, in some sense a renormalisation of all Feynman graphs at once. In
detail, we view (25) via (26) as an equation for ab and have together with 00 D 0
and .@/00 D 0 three equations for the three functions ab, 	bare
	
and Z which allows
us to eliminate 	bare and Z.

Eliminating 	bare is easy; eliminating Z is difﬁcult due to the non-linearity
in (25). We propose the following trick which postpones the non-linearity: If we
multiply (25) by Z 	2

term is independent of b. So we subtract from that equation the equation at b D 0.
Our problem is then equivalent to the difference equation plus (25) at b D 0. The
difference equation reads after elimination of 	bare, but before elimination of Z,

and C; C0 are arbitrary constants.
The possibility of C; C0 ¤ 0 is due to the fact that the ﬁnite Hilbert transform
has a kernel, in contrast to the inﬁnite Hilbert transform with integration over R.
The two formulae (30a) and (30b) are formally equivalent, but the solutions belong
to different function classes and normalisation conditions may (and will) make a
choice.
A lengthy discussion [21] shows that such a constant C; C0 arises for  > 0 but
not for  < 0. The key step in this analysis is to regard the deﬁning equation for #
as a Carleman type singular integral equation for Ga0. This allows to express Ga0 in
terms of #, and various identities in [41] and trigonometric addition theorems give
the result:
Theorem 2.6 ([21]) The matrix 2-point function Gab of the ?4

Some remarks:
•
We proved this theorem in 2012 for  > 0 under the assumption C0 D
0
in (30b), but knew that non-trivial solutions of the homogeneous Carleman
equation parametrised by C0 ¤ 0 are possible. That no such term arises for  < 0
(if angles are redeﬁned # 7! ) is a recent result [21].

We expect C; F to be ƒ-dependent so that

An important observation is Gab  0, at least for  < 0. This is a truly non-
perturbative result; individual Feynman graphs show no positivity at all!

152
H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar
•
As in [19], the equation for Gab can be solved perturbatively. This reproduces
exactly [18] the Feynman graph calculation! Matching at  D 0 requires C; F to
be ﬂat functions of  (all derivatives vanish at zero).
•
Because of Hƒ

•
The partition function Z is undeﬁned for  < 0. But the Schwinger-Dyson
equations for Gab and for higher functions, and with them log Z, extend to  < 0.
These extensions are unique but probably not analytic in a neighbourhood of
 D 0.
It remains to identify the boundary function Ga0. It is determined by (25) at
b D 0. The equation involves subtle cancellations which so far we did not succeed
to control. As substitute we use a symmetry argument. Given the boundary function
Ga0, the Carleman theory computes the full 2-point function Gab via (31). In
particular, we get G0b as function of Ga0. But the 2-point function is symmetric,
Gab D Gba, and the special case a D 0 leads to the following self-consistency
equation:

At this point we can eventually send ƒ ! 1. Any solution of (34) is automatically
smooth and monotonously decreasing. Any solution of the true equation (25)
(without the difference to b D 0) also solves the master equation (34), but not
necessarily conversely. In case of a unique solution of (34), it is enough to check
one candidate. Existence of a solution of (34) is established by the Schauder ﬁxed
point theorem. This was done in [18] for  > 0, and is work in progress for  < 0.
This solution provides Gab via (31) and all higher correlation functions via the
universal algebraic recursion formulae (24b), or via the linear equations for the basic
.N1C : : : CNB/-point functions [18].

Some comments:
•
Only a restricted sector of the underlying matrix model contributes to position
space: All strands of the same boundary component carry the same matrix index.
•
Schwinger functions are symmetric and invariant under the full Euclidean group.
This comes truly surprising since  ¤ 0 breaks both translation invariance and

manifest rotation invariance. The limit  ! 1 was expected to make this
symmetry violation even worse!

The

Ga1a1j:::jaBaB satisfy more complicated singular (but linear!) integral equations.
The solution techniques of the Carleman problem can be used in a ﬁrst step to
regularise these equations to linear integral equations of Fredholm type. These
have always a unique solution for jj small enough.
•
This (2C : : : C2)-sector describes the propagation and interaction of B (at
the moment Euclidean) particles without any momentum exchange. Such a
behaviour is necessary in any integrable model [27, 32]. It is tempting to
speculate that there might be an integrable structure behind that is responsible
for the model being solvable and for absence of momentum transfer.
•
We are aware of the problem that the absence of momentum transfer in four
dimensions is a sign of triviality. Typical triviality proofs rely on clustering,
analyticity in Mandelstam representation or absence of bound states. All this
needs veriﬁcation.
•
That the  ! 1 limit is so close to an ordinary ﬁeld theory expected for  ! 0
can be seen from the following observation: The interaction term in momentum

For  ! 1, this converges to zero almost everywhere by the Riemann-Lebesgue
lemma, unless pi; pj are linearly dependent. This case of linearly dependent

boundary components B > 1 which guarantee full Lebesgue measure!

Osterwalder-Schrader Axioms
Under conditions identiﬁed by Osterwalder-Schrader [33, 34], Schwinger functions
of a Eulidean quantum ﬁeld theory permit an analytical continuation to Wightman
functions [40, 45] of a true relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. In simpliﬁed terms, the
reconstruction theorem of Osterwalder-Schrader for a ﬁeld theory on RD says:
Theorem 3.2 ([33, 34]) Assume the Schwinger functions S.x1; : : : ; xN/ satisfy
(OS0) factorial growth,
(OS1) Euclidean invariance,

156

(OS2) reﬂection positivity,1
(OS3) permutation symmetry.

i >0, with

of Wightman functions in a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. If in addition the
S.x1; : : : ; xN/ satisfy
(OS4) clustering
then the Wightman functions satisfy clustering, too.
The Schwinger functions (38) clearly satisfy (OS1)C (OS3). Clustering (OS4) is
not realised. Bounds on Sc.	x1; : : : ; 	xN/ for large N follow from bounds on (24b)
at coinciding indices and eventually from bounds on derivatives of the 2-point
function. Formulae for @nC`Gab
@an @b` were derived in [21] and one has indeed a bound
	 C.nC`1/Š.
Thus the remaining problem is (OS2) reﬂection positivity. We will not discuss the
axiom itself. Instead we rely on the Källén-Lehmann spectral representation [25, 29]
of a Wightman 2-point function according to which the Wightman 2-point function
is a superposition of free ﬁelds with certain mass spectrum. Wightman functions
always have an analytic continuation to Schwinger functions. Comparing with
Sc.

Stieltjes functions form an important subclass of the class of completely mono-

function is Stieltjes. Widder found criteria [44] for the real function alone which
guarantee the existence of the measure and gave a sequence which weakly converges
to the measure. If the extension to the complex plane is known, then a function
f W C n 1; 0 ! C is Stieltjes if [2]
1. f.x/  0 for x > 0 (Euclidean positivity),
2. f is holomorphic on C n 1; 0,
3. f is anti-Herglotz, i.e. Im.f.x C iy/ 	 0 for y > 0 (Minkowskian positivity).
There is a complex inversion formula already due to Stieltjes (see [44]) which
recovers the measure from the boundary values at both sides of the cut.
From the anti-Herglotz property one concludes that p2 7! f.p2/ D

is Stieltjes precisely for 0 	  	 2, i.e. slower decay than p2. In this sense,
renormalisation (good decay of the propagator) contradicts positivity, and the only
chance to construct a renormalisable theory in 4 dimensions is by continuation of a
theory with good decay beyond its domain of deﬁnition, here to negative . Fourier

which must be positive. What happens is that the bare anomalous dimension is
positive for positive , but the leading term diverges. Renormalisation oversubtracts
so that the renormalised anomalous dimension gets the opposite sign of .

Recent Numerical and Analytical Results
A ﬁrst hint about the two-point function and reﬂection positivity can be obtained
from a numerical solution of the ﬁxed point equation (34). This was done in [21]
using MathematicaTM. The idea is to approximate G0b as a piecewise linear function
on Œ0; ƒ2 sampled according to a geometric progression and view (34) as iteration
GiC1
0b
D .TGi/0b for some initial function G0. We conﬁrmed the convergence of this
iteration in Lipschitz norm for any  2 R. It turned out that the required symmetry
Gab D Gba does not hold for  > 0, which is a clear hint that the winding number
contributions C; F.b/ are present for  > 0. For  < 0 everything is consistent
within small numerical errors. This allows us to compute for  < 0 all quantities of
the model with sufﬁcient precision.
We ﬁnd clear evidence for a second-order phase transition at c  0:39, which
is a common critical value in several independent problems. The ﬁrst one is the
derivative 1 C Y WD  dG0b
db
ˇˇ
bD0, viewed as function of  (Fig. 1). More precisely,
for  < c we have G0b D 1 in a whole neighbourhood of b D 0, and the length
of this neighbourhood serves as an order parameter. Since also 1 C Y D 0 for
 < c, the inﬁnite volume limit is ill-deﬁned; i.e. the model is inconsistent beyond
c. Another phase transition occurs at  D 0. It is not visible in G0b but in the full 2-
point function Gab which looses its symmetry for  > 0. This means that the ‘good’
phase is c <  	 0.

Of paramount importance is the question whether or not a 7! Gaa is a Stieltjes
function. We cannot expect a deﬁnite answer from a numerical simulation because
a discrete approximation, here a piecewise linear function, cannot be analytic.
The criteria for complete monotonicity [2] and Widder’s criterium for the Stieltjes
property [44] must fail for some order n. But reﬁning the approximation, i.e.
increasing the number L of sample points, the failure should occur at larger n, with
no failure in the limit. This is precisely what we observe: The critical index where

Property 2 excludes the Banach ﬁxed point theorem, but together with Property 3,
the Schauder ﬁxed point theorem guarantees existence of a solution Gb0.
As by-product of these investigations we obtain an analytic continuation of Gz0
to the complex plane. We prove that any function in exp.TK/, in particular any
ﬁxed point of (34), is anti-Herglotz. The function Gz0 is holomorphic outside the
negative reals and outside a certain curve in left half-plane. If we could prove that
Gz0 is differentiable on that curve, then Gb0 would be a Stieltjes. From here it is still
some work to prove that Gaa is Stieltjes, but the compatibilities established so far are
an extremely encouraging sign that this should also be true. We are thus convinced
that the model will deﬁne a true relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory in four dimensions.

Abstract The behaviour of solutions to the partial differential equation .D C
W/f D 0 is discussed, where D is a normal hyperbolic partial differential operator,
or pre-normal hyperbolic operator, on n-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The
potential term W is a C1
0
kernel operator which, in general, will be non-local in
time, and  is a complex parameter. A result is presented which states that there
are unique advanced and retarded Green’s operators for this partial differential
equation if jj is small enough (and also for a larger set of  values). Moreover, a
scattering operator can be deﬁned if the  values admit advanced and retarded Green
operators. In general, however, the Cauchy-problem will be ill-posed, and examples
will be given to that effect. It will also be explained that potential terms arising
from non-commutative products on function spaces can be approximated by C1
0
kernel operators and that, thereby, scattering by a non-commutative potential can
be investigated, also when the solution spaces are (2nd) quantized. Furthermore,
a discussion will be given in which the scattering transformations arising from
non-commutative potentials will be linked to observables of quantum ﬁelds on non-
commutative spacetimes through “Bogoliubov’s formula”. In particular, this helps
to shed light on the question how observables arise for quantum ﬁelds on Lorentzian
spectral geometries.

Introduction
The present contribution essentially reports on the results of a recent article by
Gandalf Lechner and the present author [14] to which—often without explicit
mentioning—the reader is referred for considerable further details and discussion.
The investigation of the said article is embedded in the quest for understanding the
relevant structures of quantum ﬁeld theories on non-commutative spacetimes. There
are various ways of approaching this theme, and sometimes the various strands
don’t seem to connect very well. An approach advocated by the present author
[2, 16, 20] is to attempt and combine a general description of non-commutative
spacetimes in a framework of Lorentzian spectral geometry [9, 16, 18–20] with
the basic principles of local covariant quantum ﬁeld theory [3, 7]. While this
undertaking has some promising aspects from a structural point of view, it is
hampered by being very ambitious—perhaps, overly ambitious—from the outset,
in that it attempts to design a framework for quantum ﬁeld theory on a large class
of non-commutative spacetimes, despite the fact that it is not even clear if we know
what “the general structure” of quantum ﬁeld theory on a ﬁxed non-commutative
spacetime should be. In particular, it is unclear if “the” is an appropriate preﬁx, as
there could be many structurally quite different concepts of quantum ﬁeld theory
on a given non-commutative spacetime which nevertheless appear reasonable for
the—hypothetical—physical situation for which they are conceived. Naturally, the
idea is to bring a suitably generalized principle of local covariance into play so as to
narrow down the potentially vast variety of choices one could make. Judging from
the present status of the development of quantum ﬁeld theory on non-commutative
spacetimes, there seems to lie still a long way ahead of us before this could be
achieved.
Yet, we will sketch elements of our preferred approach here. The starting point
is to set down some rudimentary conditions for a Lorentzian spectral triple, a sort of
nucleus for Lorentzian spectral geometry, and to notice that, irrespective of several
details (mostly pertaining to the analytical structure of a Lorentzian spectral triple),
one can associate a C-algebra of canonical anti-commutation relations to any
Lorentzian spectral triple. This amounts to an abstract construction of the quantized
Dirac ﬁeld on the—potentially non-commutative—spacetime geometry described
by the Lorentzian spectral triple. The usual Minkowski spacetime as well as Moyal
deformed Minkowski spacetime will serve as examples. In both examples, one
obtains the identical C algebra of the quantized Dirac ﬁeld, and thus there arises
the question of how to obtain the information that in the ﬁrst case one should regard

Wave Equations with Non-commutative Space and Time
165
the C algebra as describing the quantized Dirac ﬁeld on Minkowski spacetime,
while in the second case as describing the quantized Dirac ﬁeld on Moyal deformed
Minkowski spacetime. As we will discuss to some extent in Sect. 2, this can be
achieved by looking at the action of the algebra A of the Lorentzian spectral triple
on the quantum ﬁeld operators in the respective cases. This, in turn, may be derived
from scattering operators which relate solutions f to the Dirac equation with an
“external interaction potential”,
.D C Va/f D 0
to solutions f0 of the “free” Dirac equation Df0 D 0, at asymptotically early or
late times, akin to potential scattering in quantum mechanics. Here, D is the Dirac
operator on Minkowski spacetime, and Va is an action of an element a of A on the
f which are viewed as elements of the Lorentzian spectral triple’s Hilbert space,
H.1 Thus, in the case of Minkowski spacetime, a will typically be a (real-valued)
Schwartz function on R4 and Va will then amount to pointwise multiplication of f
by a, .Va f/.x/ D a.x/f.x/ .x 2 R4/. In contrast, in the case of Moyal deformed
Minkowski spacetime, Va is given by the Moyal product of a and f (see Sect. 2),
.Va f/.x/ D .a ? f/.x/
.x 2 R4/ :
As will be explained in Sect. 2, the scattering operators obtained from the potential
scattering in both situations lead to Bogoliubov transformations ˛ on the C
algebra of the quantized Dirac ﬁeld for any a, and differentiation with respect to the
coupling strength parameter  induces operators X.a/ (in the Hilbert space of the
vacuum representation of the “free” quantized, massless Dirac ﬁeld on Minkowski
spacetime) such that

Here, ‰.h/ is a quantized Dirac ﬁeld operator, and following the line of thought
of “Bogoliubov’s formula”, it may be regarded as an observable of the quantized
Dirac ﬁeld—in this case, linearly dependent on elements a in the algebra A of
the underlying Lorentzian spectral triple. It is the assignment a 7! X.a/ and the
algebraic relations of the X.a/ for various a which encode the information that
the quantized Dirac ﬁeld propagates in one case on usual Minkowski spacetime,
or in the other case, on Moyal deformed Minkowski spacetime. This conceptual
framework can in principle be transferred to more general Lorentzian spectral
triples.

At any rate, in order to obtain the assignment a 7! X.a/, the ﬁrst step is to obtain
scattering operators for a Dirac equation of the form
Df C a ? f D 0 :
The problem here is that the Moyal product acts non-locally, also with respect to any
time-direction on Minkowski spacetime, and therefore one cannot put this equation
into the form of a ﬁrst-order system. However, the operators Va f D a ? f can be
approximated by operators

where w is a C1

kernel (matrix-valued, since h has several components). In [14],
we have investigated question of existence and uniqueness of solutions f to the
equation

(2)
where D is either a 2nd order normal hyperbolic partial differential operator, or a
pre-hyperbolic partial differential operator (meaning that D is ﬁrst order, and there
is another ﬁrst order operator such that DD0 and D0D are normal hyperbolic—the
Dirac operator is an example) on n-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, and where
W is given by a C1
0 kernel as in (1). The results of [14], which will be summarized
in more detail in Sect. 3, are as follows: If jj is sufﬁciently small, then there are
unique advanced and retarded fundamental solutions (Green operators) for (2) (and
in fact, the Green operators are meromorphic in ); in general, the Cauchy-problem
for (2) is ill-posed (admitting arbitrary W); nevertheless, scattering operators for (2)
can be uniquely constructed. We elaborate a bit more on the perspectives of these
results for obtaining the operators X.a/ mentioned above in the ﬁnal Sect. 4.

Quantum Fields on Lorentzian Spectral Triples
In the spectral geometry approach to non-commutative spaces, the description of
a commutative or non-commutative manifold is given in terms of a spectral triple
.A; D; H/, where H is a Hilbert space, A is a -algebra of operators acting in H,
and D is a distinguished (unbounded) operator on a suitable domain in H. In the
case where the spectral triple corresponds to a “commutative” compact Riemannian
manifold with spin structure, H is formed by the space of L2 spinor ﬁelds on the
manifold, A is the—commutative—-algebra of complex valued functions on the
manifold, and D is the Dirac operator. On the other hand, Connes’ reconstruction
theorem [6] shows that, if a spectral triple has a commutative algebra A, then it
actually arises from a compact Riemannian manifold with spin structure in the

Wave Equations with Non-commutative Space and Time
167
way just indicated. That however needs further data objects for a spectral triple
and relations among them and, in particular, relations of the additional data objects
with the operator D. We refer to [5, 6, 13] for considerable further discussion.
At any rate, replacing the commutative algebra A by a non-commutative algebra
(while preserving relations between the data objects) leads to the concept of a non-
commutative compact Riemannian manifold in the spectral geometry approach. For
examples, see [13].
A physical spacetime is a four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime and it is
usually taken to be globally hyperbolic, and hence non-compact, to avoid causal
pathologies. This means that spacetimes do not ﬁt readily into the spectral geometry
approach which, therefore, must be suitably generalized to a form of Lorentzian
spectral geometry. While such a generalization of spectral geometry doesn’t appear
to have reached a ﬁnal form up to now, there is certain progress in this direction
[9–11, 16, 18, 19]. The basic idea is that a Lorentzian spectral geometry is again
described by a spectral triple .A; D; H; xi/ but with further data objects xi which
are different from the compact Riemannian manifold case mentioned before, and
have different relations among each other, and with D. As mentioned, the discussion
has not reached a ﬁnal form as to what the xi and their relations are. However, for
any promising choice, it is expected that the following holds: [4pt] Suppose two
(globally hyperbolic) Lorentzian spacetimes M and QM (with spin structures) are
described by Lorentzian spectral triples .A; D; H; xi/ and . QA; QD; QH; Qxi/. Then the
two Lorentzian spectral triples are unitarily equivalent if and only if M and QM are
isometric with equivalent spin structures. Here, the two Lorentzian spectral triples
are called unitarily equivalent if there is a unitary operator U W H ! QH such that
QA D UAU1 ; Qxi D UxiU1 ; Œ Œ QD; UaU1; Qb  D ŒUŒD; aU1; Qb
(3)
for all a 2 A, Qb 2
QA, where ŒA; B D AB  BA. [6pt] Let us introduce the
abbreviations L D .A; D; H; xi/ for a Lorentzian spectral triple and L
 U
! QL for
a unitary equivalence morphism between spectral triples induced by a unitary U as
in (3).
At this point it is in order to brieﬂy mention the basic structure of local
covariant quantum ﬁeld theory (see [3, 7] for further details not elaborated on in
these writings). A local covariant quantum ﬁeld theory consists of an assignment
M ! A.M/ of -algebras (or C-algebras) to globally hyperbolic spacetimes
M. The A.M/ are the algebras of observables, or more generally, of the quantum
ﬁeld (of a given type) on the spacetime M. Additionally, whenever there is an
isometric hyperbolic embedding M
 
! QM—i.e. if M can be viewed as a globally
hyperbolic sub-spacetime of
QM—then there should be an injective -algebra
morphism A.M/
˛ 
! A. QM/; moreover, the composition law ˛ 1ı 2 D ˛ 1 ı ˛ 2
is required to hold. Expressed in more mathematical terms, this says that a local
covariant quantum ﬁeld theory is a functor from the category of globally hyperbolic
spacetimes (all four-dimensional), with isometric hyperbolic embeddings as arrows,

168
R. Verch
to the category of -algebras, with monomorphisms as arrows. The interesting point
is that this does not amount to just dressing up quantum ﬁeld theory on general
spacetime manifolds in a fancy mathematical coat, but that it has led to signiﬁcant
new insights and results in quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetimes. We will
not report on this issue here any further but just refer to the recent survey [8] and
literature cited there for a fuller discussion.
It is suggestive to try and carry over this line of approach to quantum ﬁeld theory
on non-commutative spacetimes essentially by replacing the category of globally
hyperbolic spacetimes by the category of Lorentzian spectral triples with unitary
equivalences as arrows—for a start (this is certainly not general enough; see remark
to follow). Then a “covariant” quantum ﬁeld theory on Lorentzian non-commutative
spacetimes should be given by an assignment L ! A.L/ of a -algebra A.L/ to any
Lorentzian spectral triple L together with injective -algebra morphisms A. U/
for any unitary equivalence L
 U
! QL featuring the functorial property A. U1/ ı
A. U2/ D A. U1U2/.
The remark that this is not enough is in order now. One of the strengths of
the local covariant framework for quantum ﬁeld theory stems from the fact that
an embedding of a spacetime into a larger one is accompanied by an embedding
of the corresponding quantum ﬁeld theories. One would have to devise a similar
embedding for Lorentzian spectral triples which gives similarly rise to an embed-
ding of the associated quantum ﬁeld theory. It is not clear what a suitable concept
of embedding of Lorentzian spectral triples, to this end, would amount to. A ﬁrst
working hypothesis might be to replace the unitary U by a partial isometry, or a
partial isometry combined with a suitable generalization of the equalities in (3)
as holding only up to “negligible corrections”, an idea which is in fact of some
importance in spectral geometry [5, 13, 16]. At any rate, one encounters the problem
of what replaces the concept of locality in quantum ﬁeld theory on non-commutative
spacetimes at this point.
We are hopeful that our investigation reported on here will contribute to gaining
further understanding of these matters. To illustrate how we hope to approach that
matter, we will be more concrete and consider a very simple model for a non-
commutative version of Minkowski spacetime, the Moyal-deformed Minkowski
spacetime. As we have mentioned before, it is not entirely clear what the as-
sumptions on a Lorentzian spectral triple ultimately should be, but in case they
were set up in such a way that Moyal-deformed Minkowski spacetime does not
ﬁt into the framework, then the list of examples of quantum ﬁeld theories on
non-commutative Lorentzian spectral triple spacetimes would run thin indeed.
Therefore, we anticipate that Moyal-deformed Minkowski spacetime (as well as
Minkowski spacetime as such) can be modelled as Lorentzian spectral triples.
To that end, the primary indication and motivation comes from the discussion in
[12] (see also [2]) where Moyal planes are described as generalized Riemannian
spectral triples. That description can be given a Lorentzian variant which one
would expect to bear central features of Lorentzian spectral geometry. We outline
it here, very crudely. A Lorentzian spectral triple for “commutative” Minkowski

spacetime would start from taking a Hilbert space, H, of L2 spinors on Minkowski
spacetime. There is no Poincaré covariant notion of L2 spinors on Minkowski
spacetime but there are many possible choices depending on a choice of time
direction; consequently, the choice made will be recorded and forms a piece of
data of the spectral geometry. The algebra A can be taken to be S.R4/, the
Schwartz functions on Minkowski spacetime, with their commutative pointwise
multiplication as algebra product. The obvious choice for D is the usual Lorentzian
Dirac operator on Minkowski spacetime. To obtain a Lorentzian spectral triple for
Moyal-deformed Minkowski spacetime, one only needs to replace the commutative
algebra S.R4/ by S?.R4/, the Schwartz functions with the non-commutative
Moyal product2

as algebra product, rendering a non-commutative algebra A. (For more details, see
the references [4, 12, 17].)
The next step of interest to us is setting up a quantum ﬁeld theory on Minkowski
spacetime given in form of a Lorentzian spectral triple. Since spinors and the Dirac
operator appear in that description of Minkowski spacetime, as a beginning step it
appears most natural to start with the free quantized Dirac ﬁeld. There is indeed a
very simple way of associating to the Lorentzian spectral triple L0 D .S.R4/; D; H/
of Minkowski space the quantized Dirac ﬁeld: By deﬁning F.L0/ as the CAR
algebra—algebra of canonical anti-commutation relations—which is the unique C-
algebra generated by a unit element 1 and by elements ‰.f/, f 2 H, with the
properties:
.1/
f 7! ‰.f/ is linear ;
.2/
‰.Df/ D 0 ;
.3/

Here, the  appearing on the right hand side of (3) is a preferred complex
conjugation on H which is actually contained (previously unmentioned) in the full
list of data for a Lorentzian spectral triple. In (4), the notation used is: hf; hi is the
scalar product of the Hilbert space H, and 0 is an operator on H which is a further
datum of the Lorentzian spectral triple carrying the information about the time-
direction that has been chosen to obtain a Lorentzian scalar product on the spinors.
Incidentally, in the example at hand, 0 coincides with the Dirac matrix 0 if H is
2where .p  z/ D P
	D0;:::;3 p	z	 is the Euclidean scalar product on R4 and  is a real invertible
symplectic 4  4 matrix which is kept ﬁxed (and usually chosen with det./ D 1).

Finally, R D RC  R is the difference of retarded and advanced fundamental
solutions to the Dirac operator D which are deﬁned as (suitably continuous) linear
operators R˙ W S.R4; C4/ ! C1.R4; C4/ such that
DR˙f D R˙Df D f and supp.R˙f/  J˙.supp.f//
(6)
where J˙.supp.f// means causal future (+) / causal past ./ of supp.f/ in
Minkowski spacetime. In this case, it turns out that ihf; 0Rhi endows S.R4/ with
a semi-deﬁnite sesquilinear form, and the kernel of that form coincides with the
kernel of R.
This deﬁnes the algebra F.L0/ of the Lorentzian spectral triple of Minkowski
spacetime and it actually coincides with the usual CAR algebra of the quantized
Dirac ﬁeld in Minkowski spacetime. One observes that F.L0/ is nothing more
than an abstract “2nd quantization” of the Hilbert space H (together with the
complex conjugation ) of L0. Moreover, one also readily observes that the algebra
A D S.R4/ appearing in L0 does not enter the construction of F.L0/. On the
one hand, that can be taken as an advantage since it allows it to directly generalize
the construction of F.L0/ from L0 to the case of L? D .S?.R4/; D; H/. Clearly,
this results in F.L?/ D F.L0/ since, as mentioned, the data of L0 and L? are
identical apart from the different algebras S.R4/ and S?.R4/ which however don’t
appear in the construction. On the other hand, that invokes the question where the
information is stored that F.L?/ is the algebra of the quantized Dirac ﬁeld on
the non-commutative Moyal-deformed Minkowski spacetime whereas F.L0/ is the
algebra of the quantized Dirac ﬁeld on the classical, “commutative” Minkowski
spacetime. Obviously, in order to see the difference, one needs some kind of action
of the algebras S?.R4/ and S.R4/, respectively, on the algebra of the quantized
Dirac ﬁeld.
One possible such action can be derived from a scattering situation. Let a be
a (real) test-function of Schwartz type on R4. Regarding a as an element of the
commutative algebra S.R4/, one can modify the free Dirac equation Df0 D 0 to the
Dirac equation
.D C Va/f D 0
(7)
with a potential term Va and small (real) parameter , where
.Va f/.x/ D a.x/f.x/
(8)

Wave Equations with Non-commutative Space and Time
171
is just the action of the Schwartz function a on a spinor ﬁeld (to be thought of as an
element in H) by pointwise multiplication. On the other hand, if a is interpreted as
an element in S?.R4/, then the potential term Va takes e.g. the form
.Va f/.x/ D a ? f.x/ :
(9)
Now one can investigate the scattering problem of the Dirac equation with any of
the potentials Va of (8) or (9). This, as we will see, renders an action of a on the
ﬁeld operators ‰.f/. Let us recall how that proceeds for the potential Va in the
commutative case (8): Here, one can put the ﬁeld equation (7) in “Hamiltonian
form” (or “ﬁrst order form”). That means, denoting by u;t.x/ D f.t; x/ the Cauchy-
data at time t of a solution f to (7), f is a solution iff the u;t satisfy a ﬁrst-order
differential equation of the form
d
dtu;t C A;tu;t D 0
(10)
where A;t is, at each t, a partial differential operator acting with respect to the
spatial x-coordinates (with t-dependent coefﬁcients). In fact, a large class of partial
differential equations can be cast into this form, which often facilitates proving
existence and uniqueness of solutions to given Cauchy-data at some given value of
time t. Then one can deﬁne propagation operators T;t W u;0 7! u;t mapping data of
a solution at time 0 to the data at time t. Consequently, one can study the scattering
problem in complete analogy to the scattering problem in quantum mechanics, in
ﬁrst deﬁning the Møller operators
;˙ D
lim
t!˙1 T0;t.T;t/1
(11)
and consequently, the scattering operator (here still at “one-particle level”),
s D ;C.;/1 :
(12)
Under very general conditions, that scattering operator—mapping a solution f0 of
the Dirac equation Df0 D 0 to another solution sf0, i.e. Dsf0 D 0—induces
a C-algebra morphism ˛ on the algebra F.L0/ of the quantized Dirac ﬁeld on
Minkowski spacetime by
˛.ˆ.f0// D ˆ.sf0/
(13)
with
ˆ.Rh/ D ‰.h/
(14)
i.e. the ˆ.f0/ are again algebraic generators of the CAR-algebra of the quantized
Dirac ﬁeld, but labelled by solutions f0 to the “free” Dirac equation Df0 D 0,

172
R. Verch
whereas the ‰.h/ are labelled by test-functions; the connection between these
operators is a consequence of ‰.Dh/ D 0.
Then one can differentiate ˛.ˆ.f0// with respect to the coupling strength
parameter , evaluated at  D 0,
ıa.ˆ.f0// D

ˇˇˇˇ
D0

(16)
i.e. pointwise multiplication of the solution f0 to the free Dirac equation by
a followed by application of the advanced-minus-retarded Green operator R to
produce again a solution to the free Dirac equation. One can check that
ıa.ˆ.f0// D iŒW ‰C‰ W.a/; ˆ.f0/
(17)
where W ‰C‰ W is the normal-ordered squared Dirac ﬁeld operator. (Here interpreted
in the vacuum representation of the “free”, i.e. massless Dirac ﬁeld; ‰C is the Dirac-
adjoint ﬁeld to ‰.) Thus, (17) can be seen as an instance of “Bogoliubov’s formula”,
deriving observable ﬁelds from differentiating an S-matrix, or the corresponding
scattering transformation (in our case, ˛) with respect to the interaction strength.
This provides already a hint on how one can expect the algebra A to make an
appearance when setting up a quantum ﬁeld theory over a Lorentzian spectral triple:
In the present case, that would occur via the operators W ‰C‰ W.a/ which are to be
regarded as observables of the quantized Dirac ﬁeld (they correspond to the “squared
ﬁeld strength” weighted with a as smearing function).
Now we would like to implement a similar line of thought in the case of
the quantized Dirac ﬁeld on Moyal deformed Minkowski spacetime and ﬁnd
counterparts to the W ‰C‰ W.a/ in this case, which then provides a handle on how
S?.R4/ comes in play with the algebra F.L?/—and how this interplay differs
from the case of classical Minkowski spacetime. At that point, one encounters a
difﬁculty: The potential term Va of (9) is highly non-local, in particular, it is non-
local in time. This circumstance prevents turning the Dirac equation (7) into a
ﬁrst-order system of the form (10). Nevertheless, as will be mentioned in Sect. 4,
it is still possible to obtain (approximate) Møller operators and scattering operators
for solutions to (7), and thereby, implement “Bogoliubov’s formula” also for the
quantized Dirac ﬁeld on Moyal deformed Minkowski spacetime. We should like
to point out that this approach of gaining observables of the quantized Dirac
ﬁeld over some Lorentzian spectral triple is applicable generally—i.e. in principle
beyond Moyal-like deformations of Minkowski spacetime—once one can deﬁne the
scattering morphisms ˛ or their derivations ıa for the requisite Va corresponding to
the Lorentzian spectral triple at hand. In fact, as we will point out later, it works in
similar fashion for the localized Moyal-like deformations of Minkowski spacetime

In this section we will summarize the results of [14] on the solution behaviour of
partial differential equations of the form
Df D .D C W/f D 0
(18)
where D is a normal hyperbolic operator, or pre-normal hyperbolic operator, and f
is in C1.Rn; CN/, W is a C1
0 -kernel operator, and  is a complex parameter. The
requisite deﬁnitions from [14] are as follows:
Deﬁnition 3.1
1. A linear differential operator D on C1.Rn; CN/ is called normally hyperbolic if
there exist smooth matrix-valued functions U0; : : : ; Us; V W Rn ! CNN such
that

2. A linear differential operator D on C1.Rn; CN/ is called pre-normally hyperbolic
if D is of ﬁrst order, and there exists another ﬁrst order differential operator D0
on C1.Rn; CN/ such that D0D and DD0 are normally hyperbolic.
3. A C1
0 -kernel operator is a mapping W W C1.Rn; CN/ ! C1.Rn; CN/ which
can be represented as
.Wf/.x/ WD
Z
dy w.x; y/f.y/ ;
f 2 C1.Rn; CN/;
(20)
where w 2 C1
0 .Rn  Rn; CNN/. The family of all C1
0 -kernel operators will be
denoted by W.
As was already mentioned in the previous section, a normal hyperbolic or pre-
normal hyperbolic operator D possesses unique advanced and retarded fundamental
solutions (or Green operators) R˙ W C1
0 .Rn; CN/ ! C1.Rn; CN/ which are
characterized by the properties (6). The main result of [14], summarized in the
subsequent Theorem 3.2, states that this holds also for D D D C W where D
is (pre-) normal hyperbolic and W 2 W provided that jj is small enough, and even
more generally. However, owing to the non-local action of W in general, the support
properties of the Green-operators will not reﬂect the causal propagation behaviour
as in (6). (For a graphical illustration, see [14].)

Theorem 3.2 Let D D D C W where D is a normal hyperbolic or pre-normal
hyperbolic operator on C1.Rn; CN/, and W 2 W,  2 C. Suppose that supp.w/ 

the advanced/retarded Green operators of D.
For sufﬁciently small jj, there are unique continuous linear operators R˙

C1
0 .Rn; CN/ ! C1.Rn; CN/ such that for any f; g 2 C1
0 .Rn; CN/, the following
relations hold3:
1. DR˙
 f D f D R˙
 Df.
2. supp.R˙
 f/  J˙.suppf/ [ J˙.K/.
3. supp.R˙
 f  R˙f/  J˙.K/.
4. If J˙.suppf/ \ K D ;, then R˙
 f D R˙f.
5. If D and W are symmetric, i.e. D D D, W D W, and  2 R, then one has, for
any f; g 2 C1
0 .Rn; CN/,
hg; R˙
 fi D hR
 g; fi ;
(21)
where the scalar product h : ; : i is deﬁned analogously as in (5). Moreover,
the dependence of R˙
 on  is meromorphic (in a suitable topology)4 so that
operators R˙
 with the stated properties exist for all  values except for a nowhere
dense set.
For the proof, we refer to [14].
As mentioned already, since W will in general act non-locally (in space and time),
one cannot expect that the partial differential equation (18) admits a well-posed
Cauchy problem, even if  is chosen such that the unique advanced and retarded
Green operators R˙
 exist. We present two examples from [14] illustrating such
behaviour. The ﬁrst example shows that one may construct a W together with C1
0
initial data on a Cauchy surface such that there is no solution f to (18) with the
prescribed Cauchy data and  ¤ 0.
Proposition 3.3 Let D D  be the d’Alembert operator, † a Cauchy hyperplane,
and Wh WD hw1; hiw2 with w1; w2 ¤ 0 C1
0 functions on Rn such that supp w1  O1,
supp w2  O2 with two spacelike separated double cones O1, O2 based on †.5
Pick Cauchy data u on † supported in O1 such that f0Œu, the unique solution to
Df0Œu D 0 with these Cauchy data, satisﬁes hw1; f0Œui ¤ 0, and also assume that
Rw2 ¤ 0. Then there exists no solution f to (18) with  ¤ 0 and Cauchy data u.
3In the present context, Rn is viewed as n-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with metric
.C; ; : : : ; /, and time-direction corresponding to increasing x0-coordinate; J˙.G/ are the
causal future/past sets of G  Rn.

5That means that Oj D D.†j/ where †j are open subsets of † and D.†j/ denotes the open domain
of dependence.

Wave Equations with Non-commutative Space and Time
175
The next example from [14] shows that solutions to (18) are in general not
uniquely determined by Cauchy-data.
Proposition 3.4 Let D D  be the d’Alembert operator, Wf D hw1; fiw2, with
w1; w2 C1
0
functions on Rn having spacelike separated supports, and let † be a
Cauchy hyperplane such that supp w2  †, where † denotes the open causal
past of † (excluding †). Denoting the Cauchy data of Rw2 on † by u, let f WD
f0Œu  RCw2. Then w1 and  ¤ 0 can be chosen in such a way that the R˙
 exist, f
is a non-zero solution to Df D 0, and f has zero Cauchy data on †.
For proofs of these propositions and graphical illustrations of the situations, we refer
again to [14].
Despite these difﬁculties, one can still show that there are uniquely determined
Møller operators as well as scattering operators as soon as the Green operators
R˙
 exist. To describe the result obtained to this end in [14], we need to collect
some notation. Given D and W as before, we write R D RC
  R
 and Sol D
RC1
0 .Rn; CN/ for the space of solutions f to (18) obtained from the Green
operators (always assuming jj sufﬁciently small so that R˙
 exist uniquely). We
usually write R D R0, in keeping with previously used notation. Again we assume
that supp.w/  K  K where K is some compact subset of Rn, and we select two
Cauchy-surfaces, †˙, such that K is in the timelike past of †C and in the timelike
future of †. With these conventions, we can deﬁne the Møller operators
;˙ W Sol ! Sol0 ;
;˙.Rh/ D Rh . h 2 C1
0 .†˙
˙; CN/ /
(22)
where †C
C is the open causal future of †C and †
 is the open causal past of
†. Therefore, ; assigns to a solution f D Rh to the “interacting” equation
of motion Df D 0 the solution f0 D Rh to the “free” equation of motion Df0 D 0
which coincides with f everywhere sufﬁciently in the past of the interaction region
K. This assignment is unambiguous in view of Theorem 3.2, Item 4. The action of
;C is analogous, interchanging the past of the interaction region K with its future.
Consequently, one can deﬁne the scattering operator
s W Sol0 ! Sol0 ;
s D ;C.;/1 :
(23)
The following statement lists parts of the results in [14].

Discussion and Perspective
One can show that the scattering operator s induces, for sufﬁciently small (real)
 a Bogoliubov transformation on the CAR algebra (if D is Dirac operator)
which provides an abstract 2nd quantization of the Dirac ﬁeld (i.e. of the solution
space Sol0), as we have sketched in Sect. 2. Similarly, s induces a Bogoliubov
transformation on the CCR algebra which describes an abstract 2nd quantization of
a Bosonic ﬁeld in the case that D is a hyperbolic (wave-type) operator. Moreover,
one can establish the relations (15) and (16) for both the CAR and CCR quantized
cases. For details, see [14].
There is also the following generalization: Suppose that there is an operator W
on C1.Rn; CN/ which is no C1
0
kernel operator, but such that there is a sequence
W,  2 N, of C1
0 kernel operators which approximate W “suitably”. That means,
in particular, that (for the CAR/quantized Dirac ﬁeld case) the derivations
ı./.ˆ.f0// D

ˇˇˇˇ
D0
˛W;.ˆ.f0// D ˆ.RWf0/ ;
(26)
which are obtained from the scattering operators sW; corresponding to the potential
terms W, should converge in the limit  ! 1 to a derivation on the algebra of
ﬁeld operators of the quantized Dirac ﬁeld (in vacuum representation). That is in
fact expected to hold when taking Wh D a ? h for a Schwartz function a and the
Moyal product (4) with invertible ; it has been proved to hold in the case that  is
degenerate and has no non-zero “time-time” components [2]. It is likewise expected
to hold when taking Wh D a~h where ~ denotes a local non-commutative product
introduced by Stephan Waldmann and co-authors [1, 15]; see again [14] for further
discussion on this point. In fact, this should be obtainable by standard arguments,
and we hope to return to this issue elsewhere. Assuming that convergence of ı./
to a derivation ıW  ıa can be established in the mentioned cases, one anticipates,
as discussed in Sect. 2, that there is an assignment a 7! X.a/ of elements a in the
“non-commutative spacetime algebra” to quantum ﬁeld operators X.a/ that renders

ıa.‰.h// D iŒX.a/; ‰.h/. The non-commutativity of the elements of the spacetime
algebra is then reﬂected in algebraic relations of the X.a/ for different a, e.g. in
the behaviour of the commutator ŒX.a1/; X.a2/. However, depending on the non-
commutative structure of the algebra A from which the aj are taken, it is likely that
useful properties of ŒX.a1/; X.a2/ could only be derived for special elements a1; a2
of A. For instance, in case of A D S?.R4/, the elements of the oscillator basis of
the Moyal plane are promising candidates. This should furthermore shed a light on
potentially useful generalized locality concepts for quantum ﬁeld theories on non-
commutative spacetimes, within the Lorentzian spectral triple approach as well as
beyond.

Introduction
Quantum ﬁeld theory on “non-commutative spaces” [17] has been pursued in the
past years for a number of reasons: On the one hand, it is generally expected that
our picture of spacetime as a “classical” Lorentzian manifold, with matter described
by quantum ﬁelds that propagate on this spacetime, breaks down at extremely
small scales of the order of the Planck length P  1035 m. One expects that
localization measurements resolving such scales should not be possible [15], and
no sharp distinction between “matter” and “geometry” degrees of freedom should
exist in this regime. Since a “quantized” space with non-commuting coordinates, say
X1; : : : ; Xd1 (modeled as self-adjoint elements of some -algebra) automatically
yields uncertainty relations, i.e. lower bounds on products of uncertainties !X	 
!X, QFT on non-commutative spaces naturally leads to models in which sharp
joint measurements of several space-time coordinates is impossible.
Another motivation to consider such theories comes from renormalization
theory: Since localization at sharp points is impossible in non-commutative spaces,
one expects the ultraviolet divergences of QFT to be softer in such a setting than in
usual “commutative” Minkowski space (see, for example, [24, 33]).
Non-commutative QFT models also play a prominent role in the spectral
formulation of the standard model (see [10–12, 14] for just some sample articles),
or in approaches to quantum gravity via non-commutative structures [36].
Furthermore, also certain low-energy limits of string theory result in ﬁeld theories
QFT on non-commutative spaces [13, 34], providing further motivation to study
such models.
Finally, one can also take the point of view that the study of QFT on non-
commutative spaces can lead to new insights about QFT on commutative spaces [8].
Independentof the motivation, there is one type of non-commutativestructure which
is by far the simplest and best studied one, namely Moyal-Weyl space. Here one
postulates selfadjoint coordinate operators1 X0; X1; X2; X3, subject to the canonical
commutation relations

where 1 denotes the identity element of the algebra generated by the X	, and
the constants 	 form a real skew symmetric .4  4/-matrix. Such commutation
relations are, of course, well known from the Schrödinger representation of
quantum mechanics. In that situation, the X	 correspond to position and momentum
operators, and  is given by a factor of „ and the classical Poisson brackets.
In the setting of Moyal-Weyl spacetime, however, the interpretation of the X	 is
that of spatial (X1; X2; X3) respectively time (X0) coordinates (instead of coordinates

of phase space), deﬁning a non-commutative version of Minkowski spacetime. The
matrix  is a measure for the strength of non-commutative effects, and can be taken
to be proportional to 2
P.
This new view of the commutation relations (1) immediately leads to a well-
known problem: The symmetries of (1) do not match the Poincaré symmetry
of “classical” Minkowski space. Whereas translations, implemented by X	 7!
X	 C x	  1 with x 2
 4, do leave (1) invariant, the same is not true for Lorentz
transformations X	 7! ƒ	X. Only those Lorentz transformations that ﬁx the
matrix  also respect the relation (1), thus breaking Lorentz symmetry down to a
subgroup unless  D 0.
There are three different ways to deal with this situation, all of which have been
considered in the literature. We recall them here and list a few sample publications
for each approach.
First, one can simply accept the breaking of Lorentz symmetry, and work with
models with less symmetry than their counterparts on commutative Minkowski
space, see for example [23, 28]. As a second option, one can modify the commuta-
tion relations (1) in such a way that they become fully covariant. This point of view
has in particular been put forward by Doplicher, Fredenhagen, and Roberts [16],
who replaced the constant matrix  by an operator-valued matrix Q in the center of
the algebra generated by the X	, which has a full Lorentz orbit of real, Lorentz skew
symmetric2 .4  4/-matrices,
‚ D fƒ0ƒ1 W ƒ 2 Lg ;
(2)
as the joint spectrum of its components. Here 0 serves to ﬁx the particular orbit.
See also [21, 22] for other covariant models. Third, using methods from quantum
groups, one can “twist” the action of the Lorentz group in such a way that it is
compatible with (1) [9, 19, 39]. However, this approach is often equivalent to the
previous one [31].
In this article, we will consider the fully Poincaré covariant model proposed
in [21], with the aim to understand its behavior at ﬁnite temperature. As in the
approach taken in [16], this model involves a Lorentz orbit ‚ (2), but differs in its
localization properties. To brieﬂy introduce the model (more details will be provided
in the following section), consider the free scalar Klein-Gordon ﬁeld  on Fock
space H (i.e., in its vacuum representation, at zero temperature), and coordinate
operators X	 satisfying (1) for ﬁxed , realized on a “coordinate Hilbert space” V.

G. Lechner and J. Schlemmer
There exists a natural vacuum state on the algebra generated by the (smeared)
ﬁeld operators ˝
 , and when one passes to its GNS representation, one ﬁnds an
equivalent ﬁeld operator , acting on Fock space H instead of H ˝ V (see Sect. 2).
Concretely, this amounts to replacing the usual scalar free ﬁeld Q. p/ (in momentum
space) by its “twisted” version
Q. p/ D Q. p/  e i
2 pP ;
(4)
where P D .P0; P1; P2; P3/ denote the energy momentum operators on Fock space
(see also [3]).
When understood in a proper distributional sense, the construction (4) is unitarily
equivalent to the one on V ˝ H for ﬁxed  [21], but there is one big advantage:
Fields for different  are represented on the same Hilbert space and, since H is the
usual Fock space of the Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, one has a unitary representation U of
the full Poincaré group. Adjoint action with U.a; ƒ/ on a ﬁeld operator  yields
ƒƒ1 (which is compatible with (1)) but more importantly, is another well-deﬁned
ﬁeld operator on the same Hilbert space H. It is thus possible to make the theory
covariant, by not just taking ﬁeld operators  for some ﬁxed , but instead  for
all  from an orbit ‚ (2).
The model we want to consider is then described by the ﬁeld algebra P‚ of all
polynomials in (smeared) ﬁeld operators . f/, where  runs over the Lorentz orbit
‚, and f over the space of all test functions S. 4/. We also include the identity
operator 1, so that P‚ has the structure of a unital -algebra.
In this contribution, we want to discuss thermal equilibrium states for this
model as a concrete representative of a quantum ﬁeld theory on a non-commutative
spacetime. Below we list our motivations for this investigation and some of the
questions we want to address.
(Q1).
An important selection criterion for physically meaningful theories is their
ability to allow for thermal states. “Does the considered model have thermal
equilibrium states?”, the basic question preceding any analysis of thermal
behavior, will be investigated here. At ﬁrst sight, the appearance of functions
of the energy-momentum operators P	 in the ﬁeld algebra (already anticipated
in the twisted ﬁeld operators (4)) seems to threaten this. Further investigation
however shows that things are more complicated, warranting a more detailed
study.
(Q2).
On scales accessible to us, QFT on non-commutative spaces can be ex-
pected to yield only tiny deviations from the predictions of usual QFT. However,
it is not very clear what these deviations are, or how they could be observed. In
the model at hand, the effect of the noncommutativity parameter  on scattering
processes (at zero temperature) was investigated in [21], and shown to lead to
modiﬁcations in the phase shift of two-particle scattering. Here we ask in the
same model “what are the observational consequences of a non-commutative
structure of spacetime on the thermal behavior?”

Thermal States for QFT on Non-commutative Spacetimes
183
(Q3).
The model under consideration can also be considered as a “deformed”
theory of ﬁelds on ordinary Minkowski spacetime, where the ﬁelds are however
only localized in spacelike wedge regions. This observation is in line with several
investigations of deformations of quantum ﬁeld theories which are compatible
with Poincaré covariance and (at least partial) localization/causality properties
[38, Sect. 6],[29]. It is a common theme of these approaches that they make use
of a condition of positivity of the energy. Such a spectrum condition holds in
vacuum representations of QFT, where the vacuum state is a ground state for
the energy, but not in thermal representations because of the presence of a heat
bath from which arbitrary amounts of energy can be extracted. In fact, typical
deformation schemes do not lead to wedge-locality when considering thermal
ﬁeld theory instead of QFT in its vacuum representation [30].
From the point of view of deformation theory, it is interesting to ask what one
can do without the spectrum condition. As we shall see, an analysis of thermal
representations of deformed vacuum ﬁeld theories, such as the one considered
here, can shed new light onto this question.
On a mathematical level, these questions turn out to be best analyzed with
algebraic methods. As appropriate for proceedings of a conference covering a wide
range of topics, we will next outline the tools we rely on, essentially reviewing the
formalism of KMS states on unital -algebras (see, for example, [4]).
Following standard procedure in quantum physics [18], states on the ﬁeld (or
observable) algebra are modeled as certain functionals ! W P‚ !
, mapping
ﬁeld polynomials, generically denoted F 2 P‚, to their expectation values !.F/.
These functionals are taken to be linear, normalized in the sense that !.1/ D 1,
and positive. The precise deﬁnition of positivity depends a little on the topological
structure of the algebra,3 but always involves the condition that “squares” FF
should have positive expectation values,
!.FF/  0 ;
F 2 P‚ ;
(5)
which is necessary for ! to have a probability interpretation (positive uncertainties).
In our model, a simple example of such a state is the vacuum state on P‚: As
P‚ consists of operators on the Fock space H containing the (normalized) vacuum
vector , the vacuum state is !vac.F/ D h; Fi.
However, the concept of state is not restricted to vector states, and thinking of
thermal equilibrium states in quantum mechanics, one might consider states of the
Gibbs form !ˇ.F/ D Z1Tr.F eˇH/, where H D P0 is the Hamiltonian, ˇ D
1=T the inverse temperature, and Z D Tr.eˇH/ the partition function. Such Gibbs
ensembles are well-deﬁned in ﬁnite volume, where the Hamiltonian has discrete
3Usually, one also requires states to be continuous. In the case of a C-algebra, continuity is a
consequence of positivity, but for more general topological algebras such as the ﬁeld algebra
considered here, this is not the case. For the sake of simplicity, we do not go into these details
here.

spectrum and the trace exists. In the case of a theory in inﬁnite volume, such as the
one considered here, Gibbs states do however not exist per se, but rather only as
quantities approximating the equilibrium states in inﬁnite volume (thermodynamic
limit).
It is long since known [25] that a more intrinsic formulation of thermodynamic
equilibrium states can be given in terms of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS)
condition. This condition trades the explicit Gibbs form of the state for a boundary
condition, involving analytic continuation along the Heisenberg dynamics
t.F/ WD eitP0FeitP0 :
(6)
The precise deﬁnition of the KMS property again depends a little on the topological
structure of the algebra [20], but always involves the following condition (which is
sufﬁcient in the case of a C-algebra, and to which we restrict here for the sake of
simplicity). A KMS state at inverse temperature ˇ > 0 is a state ! on P‚ which has
the property that for each two ﬁeld polynomials F; G 2 P‚, the function

has an analytic continuation to the complex strip

continuous on the closed strip
  C iŒ0; ˇ, and satisﬁes the boundary condition
fF;G.t C iˇ/ D !.t.G/F/ ;

(8)
KMS states show the typical features of thermal equilibrium states in general, such
as invariance under the dynamics, stability, and passivity [4]. For states on “type
I von Neumann factors” [4], as they are encountered in quantum mechanics, and
dynamics with a Hamiltonian H such that Tr.eˇH/ exists, the KMS states coincide
with the Gibbs states. Thus the KMS condition provides a good characterization of
thermal equilibrium.
Returning to our above list of questions, the ﬁrst question
(Q1) can therefore be phrased as the question about existence of KMS states on
P‚. Explicit knowledge of such states (say, in terms of its n-point functions) is
also the basis of a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic behavior of
the considered system (question (Q2)). In the present conference paper, we restrict
ourselves to announce several results concerning the algebraic structure of P‚ and
its equilibrium states, including explicit formulas for their n-point functions. A
full analysis with detailed proofs will be presented elsewhere. We however wish
to motivate why it is useful to have a closer look at the algebraic structure of P‚ in
this context, and to this end, proceed with an outline of the paper.
In Sect. 2, we introduce the vacuum representation of the model in more detail.
The algebra P‚, containing smeared polynomials in all ﬁeld operators ,  2 ‚,
obviously has as subalgebras the polynomials in ﬁelds  with a ﬁxed  2 ‚. These
subalgebras will be denoted Pfg  P‚, and referred to as “ﬁbers”. Since each such
ﬁber is invariant under the dynamics t, it is clear that given a KMS state on P‚, it

Thermal States for QFT on Non-commutative Spacetimes
185
restricts to KMS states on each of the ﬁbers Pfg. Thus, as a preliminary step, we
consider in Sect. 3 the KMS states on a ﬁxed ﬁber.
It turns out that the thermal states of Pfg can be easily analyzed completely.
Namely, by exploiting a natural bijection with the “zero ﬁber” Pf0g, containing the
polynomials in the undeformed free Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, we ﬁnd that the KMS states
on Pfg and Pf0g are in one to one correspondence. Moreover, one can explicitly
calculate all n-point functions of these equilibrium states by basically the same
techniques as in the undeformed case. These results are obtained by making use of
the machinery underlying Rieffel’s deformation theory [32] and the related concept
of warped convolutions [7, 8], and allow us to substantially generalize ﬁndings
of Balachandran and Govindarajan about the thermal four-point function at ﬁxed
noncommutativity  [2].
Having settled the structure of thermal equilibrium states at ﬁxed  (i.e., for
the non-covariant models build on (1)), we proceed to the analysis of thermal
equilibrium states on the full ﬁeld algebra P‚ in Sect. 4. Here a completely new
aspect enters, both on the level of the structure of the ﬁeld algebra, and on the level
of its thermal equilibrium states. To see this effect, note that the ﬁeld operators4 (4)
satisfy the twisted commutation relation
Q. p/ Q0.p0/  eip.C0/p0 Q0.p0/ Q. p/ D QC.p; p0/ eip.0/P ;
(9)
where QC.p; p0/ denotes the (number-valued) momentum space commutator of two
undeformed ﬁelds Q. p/; Q.p0/. For ; 0 2 ‚,  ¤ 0, this shows that certain
functions of the energy momentum operators P	 are elements of P‚ (which are
not present in the ﬁbers Pfg). In addition to the ﬁbers Pfg, the algebra thus also
contains a commutative subalgebra T‚ containing functions of P.
This subalgebra has the peculiar property that, consisting of functions of the
(commuting) energy momentum operators P0; : : : ; P3, each of its elements is
invariant under the dynamics t.F/ D eitP0FeitP0.
Thus the functions fF;G.t/ D !.Ft.G// appearing in the KMS condition are
constant for each F; G 2 T‚, and because T‚ is abelian, ! automatically satisﬁes
the required analyticity and boundary condition (8). This observation implies that,
in sharp contrast to the situation on the ﬁbers Pfg, each state on T‚ is a KMS state.
In other words, the KMS condition does not put any constraints on the expectation
values !.F/, F 2 T‚.
As a consequence, a very large family of KMS functionals (at ﬁxed temperature)
appears. Usually, the appearance of several distinct KMS states at the same
temperature is taken as a sign for different thermodynamic phases that can coexist
at that temperature. The picture of many “non-commutative phases” appearing at
any ﬁnite temperature seems to be hard to maintain, and in fact, it has to be taken
into account that these KMS functionals must also meet the essential positivity

formulas.

condition (5) in order to have physical meaning. While on the level of linear relations
used to determine n-point functions, there are many similarities to thermal states of
free ﬁeld models – with the exception of the mentioned additional freedom on T‚ –
things get more complicated for the nonlinear relation (5).
Using yet another subalgebra J‚  P‚, namely an ideal generated by the
projection onto the vacuum vector, the positivity questions can be completely
settled. It turns out that the positivity requirement singles out a unique KMS state
on P‚. We discuss some of its properties in Sect. 4. In particular, we describe its
associated GNS representation, which is “more commutative” than the algebra P‚
at temperature zero. We end by explaining the implications of this observation for
the question (Q3) on our list, and with an account of some open questions which we
are currently investigating.

The Model
In this section we deﬁne the vacuum representation of the model that we consider.
Fixing a mass parameter m > 0, we consider the single-particle Hilbert space
H1 WD L2. 4; d	m. p//;
with the mass shell measure d	m. p/ D ı.p0  .p//
d4p
2. p/, where p D .p0; p/ and
.p/ D .m2 Cp2/1=2 is the single particle Hamiltonian. On H1 there acts the unitary
irreducible representation U1 of the proper orthochronous Poincaré group with mass
m and spin zero, given by .U1.a; ƒ/ /. p/ D eipa .ƒ1p/.
The full vacuum Hilbert space H is deﬁned as the Bose Fock space over H1. It
carries the second quantized representation U of the Poincaré group and contains
the U-invariant vacuum vector . For pure translation operators, we will also write
U.x/ D eixP  U.x; 1/ ;
x 2

(10)
Here P D .P0; P1; P2; P3/ are the energy-momentum operators (with joint spectrum
contained in the forward light cone). In particular, P0 D H is the Hamiltonian giving
the dynamics with respect to which we will be looking for thermal equilibrium.
The adjoint action of U on operators will, as usual, be denoted ˛x;ƒ.F/ D

On H, the (undeformed) free scalar Klein-Gordon ﬁeld  of mass m acts in the usual

with a, a Bose creation and annihilation operators, f 2 S. 4/ a test-function from

(14)
According to the terminology used in the Introduction, the ﬁeld algebra of the
free ﬁeld  is denoted Pf0g, because it corresponds to ﬁxed deformation parameter
 D 0. Since we are interested in QFT at ﬁnite temperature, we also recall the
known results about the KMS states of Pf0g.

Item (2.1) tells us that the linear relations already ﬁx the state up to normalization,
so the problem of determining KMS states is essentially a linear one.

form. Denoting the distributional kernels of f1 ˝ : : : ˝ fn 7! !0..f1/    .fn// (in

the -algebraic setting considered here, some weak continuity assumptions are required in order to
have analytical tools like Fourier transforms available. Here and in the following we will always
restrict to states whose n-point functions are temperate distributions.

Regarding (b), recall that any KMS state is invariant under the time translations 
it refers to, but not necessarily invariant under spatial translations as well. It is clear
from (16) and (13) that !0 is also invariant under spatial rotations (but not under
Lorentz boosts). However, the only relevant symmetry of !0 that we will exploit
later is its invariance under spacetime translations.
We also recall the GNS representation of Pf0g with respect to its KMS state !0,
the well-known Araki-Woods representation [1]: The representation Hilbert space
is7 H0 WD H ˝ H, the vector implementing the KMS state is 0 WD  ˝ ,
and the vacuum ﬁelds . f/ 2 Pf0g are represented on H0 as 0.. f// D ..1 C

!0.F0/ D h0; 0.F0/0iH0 ;
F0 2 Pf0g :
(17)
As !0 is invariant under translations, H0 also carries a unitary representation
U0 of the space-time translations, related to the translations U in the vacuum
representation by U0.x/ D U.x/ ˝ U.x/. Because of the conjugation in the second
tensor factor, this representation does not have positive energy, but rather all of
 4
as its energy-momentum spectrum.
Having recalled the relevant structures of the undeformed free ﬁeld theory, we
now proceed to its deformed version. Let  denote a real Lorentz skew symmetric

the deformation. Comparing  with the inversely deformed ﬁeld , one ﬁnds
localization in Rindler wedges. We refer to [21] for more details on this, and the

KMS States for the Fiber Algebras
Given any KMS state on the full ﬁeld algebra P‚, one obtains KMS states on all of
its ﬁbers Pfg  P‚,  2 ‚, by restriction. In this section, we therefore consider
the KMS states of the ﬁber algebras Pfg as a ﬁrst step towards understanding the
KMS states of P‚. This amounts to determining the thermal equilibrium states of
QFT models without Lorentz covariance, formulated on Moyal space with ﬁxed .
The analysis of thermal states on Pfg becomes most transparent if one uses
the fact that Pfg can be seen as a deformation of the “zero ﬁber” Pf0g (the ﬁeld

190
G. Lechner and J. Schlemmer
algebra of the Klein Gordon ﬁeld on commutative Minkowski spacetime), related to
introducing a new product on Pf0g.
This situation is familiar from deformation quantization, where one introduces
(non-commutative) star products on the (initially commutative) algebra of classical
observables by pulling back the operator product of the quantum observables. In
fact, since the commutation relations (1) are just the Heisenberg commutation
relations, it is no surprise that there are several mathematical analogies between
theories on Moyal space with a ﬁxed non-commutativity matrix  on the one hand,
and deformation quantization on the other hand. In the present setting, where also
the algebra Pf0g corresponding to the undeformed situation is non-commutative, the
right tools for setting up such a deformation are Rieffel’s procedure [32] and its
generalizations, in particular the “warped convolution” [7, 8]. We brieﬂy recall here
the relevant structures.
To begin with, we introduce the “Weyl-Moyal tensor product” between test
functions of several variables as a slight generalization of (20). For fn 2 S. 4n/,

This product is an adaptation of Rieffel’s product [32] to ﬁeld algebras as they
appear in Wightman QFT [22]. Equipping the zero ﬁber Pf0g with the product
 instead of its original product (the usual operator product, which for ﬁeld
operators corresponds to the normal tensor product between test functions) results
in a deformed version of Pf0g: The linear structure is the same as that of Pf0g, and

the product .

where .fn/ is deﬁned as in (24), with  replaced by , and then extended by
linearity.
Proposition 3.1 The map D is an isomorphism of unital -algebras between the
zero ﬁber .Pf0g; /, with the product , and the ﬁber Pfg over , with the usual
operator product. That is, D is a linear bijection satisfying for F0; G0 2 Pf0g,

Moreover, D commutes with translations, i.e.

(27)
We mention as an aside that just like Pf0g, also Pfg D D.Pf0g/ has the vacuum
vector  as a cyclic vector because D.F0/ D F0, F0 2 Pf0g [8].
Since .Pf0g; / and Pf0g coincide as vector spaces, it is straightforward to pass
from linear8 functionals on Pf0g to functionals on .Pf0g; /: One can simply use
the same functional. Formulated in terms of Pfg D D.Pf0g/, this means that a
functional ! W Pf0g !
 is transported to a functional ! W Pfg !
, deﬁned as
! WD !0 ı D
1 :
(28)
This deﬁnition yields a one to one correspondence between functionals on the
undeformed ﬁber Pf0g and the deformed ﬁber Pfg. For  D 0, one recovers the
original functional !0 D !.
In view of Proposition 3.1, the correspondence (28) preserves normalization and
invariance under translations, i.e. !.1/ D 1 if and only if !0.1/ D 1, and ! ı
˛x;1 D ! for all x 2
 4 if and only if !0 ı ˛x;1 D !0 for all x 2
 4.
We are interested in KMS states, and therefore also have to consider the
compatibility of the map ! 7! ! with positivity, and with the KMS condition.
The notion of positivity is a different one in Pf0g and .Pf0g; /: Whereas squares
of the form F
0 F0 are positive in the sense of Pf0g, squares of the form F
0  F0
are positive in the sense of .Pf0g; /. These two positive cones do not coincide,
and therefore a positive functional ! on Pf0g is in general not positive on .Pf0g; /
[27].
However, things simplify drastically when considering translationally invariant
functionals ! on Pf0g. In this case, one has [22, 35]
!.F0  G0/ D !.F0G0/ ;
F0; G0 2 Pf0g ;
(29)
8All functionals considered here are linear, so that we refer to them just as functionals for brevity.

192
G. Lechner and J. Schlemmer
similar to the well-known formula R d4x .f ? g/.x/ D R d4x f.x/g.x/ for the Weyl-
Moyal star product. From (29) it is clear that with a translationally invariant, positive
functional ! W Pf0g !
, also ! W Pfg !
 is positive (at least on squares).
Namely, for arbitrary F0 2 Pf0g, we have
!.D.F0/D.F0// D !.D.F
0  F0// D !.F
0  F0/ D !.F
0 F0/  0 :
Furthermore, by the same argument one also sees that the functions
t 7! !.D.F/t.D.G/// D !.Ft.G//
are independent of , so that their analyticity properties and the relation (8)
between their boundary values, as required in the KMS condition, transfer from
the undeformed ﬁber to the deformed one immediately.
All this applies only to KMS states that are invariant under all space-time
translations. However, since the (unique) KMS state on Pf0g has this property
(Lemma 2.1(b)), these considerations cover the situation of interest here. We ﬁnd
the following result.
Theorem 3.2
(a) The mapping !0 7! ! deﬁned above is a bijection between the functionals
on Pf0g and Pfg. The functional ! is normalized (respectively translationally
invariant) if and only if !0 is normalized (respectively translationally invariant).
(b) For translationally invariant functionals !0 on Pf0g, ! satisﬁes the KMS
condition (is positive) if and only if !0 satisﬁes the KMS condition (is positive).
(c) There exists a unique KMS state on each ﬁber Pfg, given by ! D !0 ı D 1.
(d) The n-point functions of this unique KMS state ! are
Q!;n.p1; : : : ; pn/ WD !. Q.p1/    Q.pn// D
Y
1	l<r	n
eiplpr  Q!0;n.p1; : : : ; pn/:
(30)
The formula for n-point functions stated in part (d) can be derived by straightfor-
ward calculation similar to the vacuum case [22].
The KMS states ! on Pfg can also be obtained by direct calculation of their
n-point functions by imposing the KMS condition (cf. the calculation at the
beginning of the next section). This approach was taken in [26], see also [2] for
a partial analysis in the context of non-covariant ﬁeld theories on Moyal space.
However, in our opinion, the more algebraic point of view taken here makes the
situation particularly clear. Moreover, it applies without essential modiﬁcations also
to more complicated ﬁeld theories – in particular, the commutation relations (13)
are not needed in our approach, but often form the basis of direct calculations.
The situation described in Theorem 3.2 closely resembles the case of undeformed
ﬁelds: For each inverse temperature ˇ > 0, there exists exactly one thermal equilib-
rium state, and this state is translationally invariant. Furthermore, the distributional

Thermal States for QFT on Non-commutative Spacetimes
193
kernels of its n-point functions in momentum space depend on  only via phase
factors. Note however that due to these phase factors, the thermal states on Pfg are
no longer quasi-free. This close relation between Pfg and Pf0g is also reﬂected on
the level of the (GNS) representations  and 0 induced by ! and !0: The GNS
representation  of Pfg with respect to its unique KMS state ! D !0 ı D 1
acts on the same representation space H0 as for  D 0, with the same implementing
vector 0 (cf. page 188). Analogously to the vacuum case (4), the representation of
the deformed ﬁber Pfg can be realized as (in the sense of distributions)
. Q. p// D . Q. p//U0.p/ :
(31)
That is, the thermal representation of a deformed ﬁber is given by warped convo-
lution w.r.t. the translation representation U0 on the thermal Hilbert space. In this
sense, deforming and going to a thermal representation commute on a single ﬁber.
However, the algebra generated by the ﬁelds .. f//, when  is no longer
ﬁxed but ranges over the orbit ‚, does not form a representation of P‚. This is
so because of certain residual localization properties that are present in P‚: If
the supports of two test functions f; g are carefully chosen (in spacelike wedges
depending on ), then Œ. f/; .g/ D 0 as a relation in P‚. This relation is
a consequence of the spectrum condition in the vacuum case, and clearly persists
in any representation of P‚. But the ﬁelds .. f// and ..g// do not
commute in general for f and g with the mentioned support properties. This is a
consequence of the spectrum condition being violated in the thermal representation
[30].
This observation already indicates that a thermal representation of the full
algebra P‚ has to take place on a “larger” space than H0, such that more elements
have the possibility to commute. How this representation, induced by a state with
many vanishing n-point functions, comes about, will be the topic of the next and
ﬁnal section.

KMS States for the Covariant Theory
After discussing KMS states for the ﬁber subalgebras Pfg  P‚ of our ﬁeld
algebra, we now come to the analysis of KMS states (and KMS functionals) on all
of P‚. As announced in the Introduction, here we present some preliminary results
that will appear in more detail in a forthcoming publication.
The structure of thermal expectation values can most easily be described by again
using (idealized) Fourier transformed, deformed ﬁelds Q. p/ at sharp momenta p;
some of the subtleties involved in a mathematically completely rigorous discussion
will be mentioned later.
To give a ﬁrst impression of some of the new aspects that appear, we
present the calculation of thermal two-point functions, the simplest non-vanishing
n-point functions. Using the symbolic expression Q. p/ D Q. p/U.p/ (4) for

194
G. Lechner and J. Schlemmer
the deformed ﬁelds, and the exchange relation U.x/ Q. p/ D eipx Q. p/U.x/ (14)
between translation unitaries U.x/ and (undeformed) ﬁeld operators Q. p/, products
Q1.p1/    Qn.pn/ of deformed ﬁelds can be written as products of undeformed
ﬁelds, multiplied from the right with a translation unitary and a phase factor.
Assuming a KMS functional ! on P‚, the task is thus to determine the expectation
values of expressions like Q.p1/    Q.pn/U.x/ (where x D  Pn
jD1 jpj depends
on the j and pj) in !. For the case of the two point function, this amounts to
determining the expectation value of Q. p/ Q.p0/U.p  0p0/ from the KMS
condition.
On a formal level, this can be done as follows. Since the translation unitaries
U.x/ are invariant under the dynamics, we have
t. Q.p0/U.x// D eitp0
0 Q.p0/U.x/
)
tCiˇ. Q.p0//U.x/ Deitp0
0ˇp0
0 Q.p0/U.x/ :
(32)
On the other hand, using the exchange relation of U.x/ with the Fourier transformed
ﬁelds, we ﬁnd
t. Q.p0/U.x// Q. p/ D eitp0
0Cixp Q.p0/ Q. p/U.x/
D eitp0
0Cixp  QC.p0; p/U.x/ C Q. p/ Q.p0/U.x/

(33)
Multiplying (32) from the left with Q. p/ and comparing with (33), we thus see that
in a KMS functional ! on P‚, the following equation must hold
.eˇp0
0ixp  1/!. Q. p/ Q.p0/U.x// D QC.p0; p/!.U.x// ;
(34)
and, setting x D p  0p0,
!. Q. p/ Q0.p0// D !.U.p  0p0//
QC.p; p0/
1  eˇp0Cip.pC0p0/ :
(35)
This calculation is, of course, only of a formal nature, a rigorous analysis requires
in particular a proper treatment of the distributional nature of the appearing ﬁelds.
Nonetheless, (35) illustrates the main difference to the KMS states on the ﬁber
algebras, where  D 0 is ﬁxed. In that case, the term !.U.x// as well as the
term ix  p in the exponential function are not present, because of the translational
invariance the commutator QC.p; p0/, leading to p0 D p. For  D 0, an analogous
calculation directly determines the expressions for (the kernel of) the Fourier-
transformed two-point function, up to normalization.
In the case of the full ﬁeld algebra, however, we retain an expectation value of an
element U.x/, which is precisely the point already mentioned in the Introduction:
Functions of the (vacuum) energy-momentum operators appear in the algebra and
their expectation values are a new freedom (not restricted by the KMS condition),
which is reﬂected in the n-point functions.

Thermal States for QFT on Non-commutative Spacetimes

In other words, P‚ contains a commutative subalgebra T‚ of functions of the
momentum operators P, on which the dynamics acts trivially, and we also have to
ﬁx ! on this subalgebra. When working with properly smeared ﬁelds, T‚ can be
identiﬁed with certain continuous functions on the joint spectrum of the momentum
operators. It then follows that each KMS-state ! on P‚ is given by an – a priori
arbitrary – measure  (with mass bounded by one) on the energy-momentum
spectrum.
By systematically exploiting the KMS condition along the same lines as in the
above calculation, the n-point functions can be determined for all n 2
 [26]. These
functions (which – by forming linear combinations – also give back the expectation
values on T‚), now contain as an additional ingredient the Fourier transform Q
of the measure . More precisely, a modiﬁed version O of Q, deﬁned to take the
value 1 at the origin but otherwise identical to Q, appears and is formally related
to the expectation values of translation operators by !.U.x// D O.x/. The n-point
functions still have some structural similarity to quasi-free states: they vanish for an
odd number of ﬁeld operators, and for an even number are given by

where the sum runs over all contractions as in (16).
At this point a few remarks are in order.
•
Whereas for the undeformed theory, and also for the Moyal-Weyl deformation
with ﬁxed , the thermal n-point functions for the Klein-Gordon ﬁeld (with
positive mass) are already uniquely determined by the (linear) KMS-condition
up to normalization, this condition is much less restrictive for the full ﬁeld
algebra P‚: We have a huge additional freedom when only using the KMS
condition; this freedom is parametrized by Fourier transforms of distributions
on the energy-momentum spectrum in the vacuum representation. Positivity on
T‚ reduces this freedom somewhat, but still all Fourier transforms Q of measures
on the spectrum remain as possible choices.
•
The structures appearing in these calculations look very similar to crossed
products from the theory of operator algebras. Furthermore, the calculation
of KMS functionals on elements given as undeformed ﬁelds times unitaries
representing translations can be reinterpreted in terms of a “twisted” KMS
condition [5]. We hope to return to these interesting links at a later point.
•
The formula (36) should be read as follows: If a KMS functional ! exists on
P‚, then its n-point functions must have the speciﬁed form, with some measure
. We are currently investigating also the converse direction, namely if given a
measure  on the energy-momentum spectrum, (36) deﬁnes a (KMS) functional
on P‚. To answer this question, one must in particular make sure that the
n-point functions (36) yield a well-deﬁned functional ! on P‚. In the case of the

196
G. Lechner and J. Schlemmer
undeformed theory, the algebra Pf0g is simple and can be written as a quotient
of a free algebra by a (maximal) ideal JRel. This ideal is generated by the usual
relations (a) linearity of f 7! . f/, (b) the Klein-Gordon equation, and (c) the
commutation relations (13). To formulate a well-deﬁned functional ! on Pf0g,
one therefore only has to check that its n-point functions are consistent with
(a)–(c).
In contrast, P‚ is not simple. We will consider a non-trivial ideal in it below,
but currently have no complete knowledge of its full ideal structure. Nonetheless,
we expect that for any measure , (36) deﬁnes a unique KMS functional on P‚.
We do however not make any claim towards positivity at this stage. Recall that
in the case of a single ﬁber, each normalized KMS functional was automatically
positive because of Lemma 2.1(c). This is not the case for the KMS functionals
on the full ﬁeld algebra, and we return to the positivity question below.
•
Although the structure of the n-point functions looks similar to the case of
single ﬁbers (and thus the non-deformed case), there are now terms involving
all momenta instead of only pairs. Furthermore the simple Bose factors are
modiﬁed by an additional imaginary term in the exponent. These two changes
might appear as minor details at ﬁrst sight, but make it very hard to directly check
for positivity (5) of the n-point functions (36). Even simpler, necessary properties
of states – like hermiticity, i.e. !.F/ D !.F/ – are not trivial to show.
The main question is now if there are choices for the measure  such that the
above n-point functions determine a positive functional, i.e. a state on P‚. To answer
this question, it turns out to be most efﬁcient to consider a particular ideal of P‚,
instead of directly analyzing the n-point functions.
This ideal is deﬁned as follows: A closer inspection of the subalgebra T‚  P‚
shows that it also contains functions whose support intersects the energy-momentum
spectrum only in f0g, i.e. the one-dimensional projection E D jihj is an
element of T‚. Multiplying this projection from both sides by elements from P‚,
one generates an ideal
J‚ WD fFEG W F; G 2 P‚g
(37)
of ﬁnite-rank operators, which can be shown to be dense in the C-algebra of all
compact operators on H.
By standard arguments [4], it follows that any KMS state ! on P‚ must vanish
identically on J‚. This implies directly that the measure  associated with ! must
satisfy .f0g/ D 0. In fact, even more is true: By suitably choosing F 2 P‚, one can
show that 0 D !.FE/ implies that the measure has to vanish altogether,  D 0.
Thus all except one of the KMS functionals (36), namely the one given by the
zero measure, are not positive. In contrast to the undeformed or single ﬁber case,
positivity plays an important role in selecting KMS-states: From an uncountable
family of candidate functionals which satisfy the KMS-condition, positivity selects
a unique one.

Thermal States for QFT on Non-commutative Spacetimes

Choosing  D 0 means that O is only non-zero at zero, which leads to a drastic
decoupling of the individual ﬁbers: Only n-point functions in which the deformed
ﬁelds 1; : : : ; n appear in pairs belonging to the same ﬁber Pfjg are non-zero.
Furthermore, the subalgebra T‚ of functions of momentum operators is mapped to
zero except for the case of the identity operator; intuitively the unitaries “average
out” by rapid oscillations in the thermodynamic limit.
To show that the remaining KMS functional, associated with the measure  D 0,
is positive, it is best to directly specify its GNS representation, as we shall do
next. The GNS space H‚ is a non-separable, inﬁnite tensor product labeled by
the elements in the orbit ‚, and the GNS representation ‚ reads (in the sense
of distributions)
‚. Q. p// D

1 ˝    ˝ 1 ˝ 0. Q. p// ˝ 1 ˝    ˝ 1


O
#2‚
U0.#p/ ;
(38)
where 0. Q. p// acts on the tensor factor labeled by , and 0 is the GNS
representation of the zero ﬁber w.r.t. its KMS state !0. Summing up, we have the
following theorem.
Theorem 4.1 On P‚, for each ˇ > 0 there exists precisely one KMS state at inverse
temperature ˇ. Its n-point functions are (36) with  D 0, the thermal representation
it induces is given by (38).
From the form of the GNS representation (38), also the mentioned decoupling of
the ﬁbers is most transparent: For  ¤ 0, one has the exchange relation
‚. Q. p// ‚. Q0.p0// D eip.C0/p0 ‚. Q0.p0// ‚. Q. p// ;
(39)
and the commutation relation in a ﬁxed ﬁber are unchanged. This is even stronger
than the wedge-local structure mentioned in the Introduction. Whereas in the
vacuum representation, . f/ and .g/ commute if the supports of f and g lie
in a particular spacelike position depending on , in the thermal representation ‚
we have commutation of ‚. Q. f// and ‚. Q.g// for arbitrary supports of f; g.
Thus the represented algebra ‚.P‚/ appears “more commutative” than its
vacuum counterpart P‚, its ﬁbers almost completely decouple at ﬁnite temperature.
In the context of question (Q3) from the Introduction, this decoupling is the
mechanism by which the representation ‚ becomes wedge-local despite violating
the spectrum condition. This however comes at the price of a non-separable
representation space, in contrast to the vacuum situation which is better behaved
from this point of view. It provides further evidence to the effect that the requirement
of a decent thermodynamic behavior can seriously restrict “twist structures”, as also
observed in supersymmetric theories [5, 6].

Abstract First, we review the C-algebraic foundations of loop quantization, in
particular, the construction of quantum conﬁguration spaces and the implementation
of symmetries. Then, we apply these results to loop quantum gravity, focusing on
the space of generalized connections and on measures thereon. Finally, we study
the realm of homogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology: once viewed as the
loop quantization of classical cosmology, once seen as the symmetric sector of
loop quantum gravity. It will turn out that both theories differ, i.e., quantization
and symmetry reduction do not commute. Moreover, we will present a uniqueness
result for kinematical measures. These last two key results have originally been due
to Hanusch; here, we give drastically simpliﬁed and direct proofs.

Introduction
The quantization of gravity is one of the grand unsolved problems in mathematical
physics. As can be seen from this edited volume again, there are several different
attempts to disclose at least glimpses of the desired theory. Loop quantum gravity
[9, 53], the approach that sets the framework for the present contribution, is one
of them. It originates in a formulation of gravity, by means of so-called Ashtekar
variables [2], as a canonical gauge ﬁeld theory with constraints that is quantized
along the ideas of Dirac [5, 10]. The kinematical part of loop quantum gravity has
been well understood; there are even very strong uniqueness results [29, 44] that play
the same role as the Stone-von Neumann theorem for quantum mechanics. However,
despite the marvelous results obtained by Thiemann et al. [53] and references
therein, our knowledge about dynamical consequences of the theory is still rather
poor. What to do?
One strategy to investigate complicated physical theories is to study toy models
with special symmetries hoping that these models exhibit key features of the full
system. In particular, gravity has very much proﬁted from such ideas. Among the
ﬁrst solutions to Einstein’s equations, there have been the Schwarzschild solution
corresponding to spherically symmetric black holes or the Friedmann solutions that
describe homogeneous and isotropic universes. All these have been results within
classical gravity. But also in loop quantum gravity, the reduce-symmetry strategy
has been successfully implemented. Some 15 years ago, Bojowald, based on his idea
with Kastrup [20], invented a theory, now called loop quantum cosmology [11]. He
simply quantized cosmological models along the lines of the full theory. It brought
about many interesting results like the resolution of big-bang singularities [18] or

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
203
later big-bounce scenarios [12]. As one had hoped, the dynamics of loop quantum
cosmology was much easier accessible, indeed.
The relation between loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology, how-
ever, has remained unclear. Before explaining this, let us recall some key ingredients
of the loop approach [5, 6, 10, 23]. First, there is some quantum conﬁguration space
X, which is compact and contains the classical one as a dense subset. Second,
X admits some appropriate measure 	 that induces the kinematical L2 Hilbert
space. Finally, states are constructed using Gelfand triples. Now, the original idea of
Bojowald and Kastrup [20] was as follows: consider the cosmological conﬁguration
space as a subset of that of full gravity, and continuously extend this embedding
to the corresponding quantum conﬁguration spaces. Based on this extension, one
constructs the algebras of basic variables and ﬁnally the states by duality.
This connection, however, broke down when Brunnemann and the author [21]
discovered that there is no continuous extension of the embedding at classical level
to one at quantum level. Note that this does not mean that loop quantum gravity or
loop quantum cosmology considered as theories of their own are now wrong; it has
merely been the bridge between both theories that has been destroyed.
In order to ﬁll that conceptual gap, the kinematics of loop quantum cosmology
has had to be carefully revisited. In the present article, we would like to report on
the present status of this endeavor [23, 31, 38]. For this, we will ﬁrst outline the
mathematical theory of how to construct quantum conﬁguration spaces in the loop
quantization framework, then apply it to loop quantum gravity and ﬁnally discuss
all the (kinematical) issues above for homogeneous isotropic cosmologies, being in
some sense the easiest example. It will surprisingly turn out that the original idea of
Bojowald-Kastrup remains valid if one modiﬁes their quantum conﬁguration space
appropriately.

Quantization and Symmetries
The conﬁguration space of loop quantum gravity has originally been obtained using
C-algebras [5]. Later, it has been shown that it can also be identiﬁed with a
certain projective limit [7, 8]. Although the latter framework is better suited for the
construction of measures, the C-algebraic approach has turned out best suited for
our purposes, namely quantization and implementation of symmetries. Its basic idea
is as follows: One starts with an arbitrary classical conﬁguration space X. Then, one
chooses some C-algebra A consisting of bounded complex-valued functions on X
that are to be quantized in some sense; this is the core part of loop quantization.
To implement symmetries, as usual, one assumes to be given a symmetry group S
acting1 on X. This allows to perform
1One may assume w.l.o.g. that the action is effective although we will never use this.

•
Quantization
The quantum conﬁguration space X is simply the spectrum of A.
•
Symmetry Reduction
The classical reduced conﬁguration space Xred comprises the elements in X that
are invariant w.r.t. the symmetry group S.
One is now immediately tempted to ask:
•
Quantization ı Symmetry Reduction
Can we quantize the reduced classical conﬁguration space as the full one? And
how are the quantum conﬁguration spaces of the full theory and the reduced
theory related? – Well, it will turn out, that the answer crucially depends on the
choice of the algebra in the symmetric case.
•
Symmetry Reduction ı Quantization
Can we implement symmetries even on quantum level? – Yes, provided the
underlying algebra is invariant.
This leads us to the most important question: Does it matter whether we
implement symmetry before or after quantization? Or even shorter:
Do quantization and symmetry reduction commute?
Unfortunately, there is no general answer. But at least for some particular cases in
loop quantum cosmology, the answer is known as we will have learned by the end
of this review.
To start with the general framework, in Sect. 2.1, we review the deﬁnition of
quantum conﬁguration spaces from [23].2 Then, in Sect. 2.2 we review, again from
[23], a criterion guaranteeing that a mapping between classical conﬁguration spaces
can be lifted to their quantum counterparts. The lifting is functorial (Sect. 2.3),
which allows to lift even group actions (Sect. 2.4). Finally, in Sect. 2.5, we review
the results from [38] on the relations between the quantum symmetric and the
symmetric quantum conﬁguration spaces.
2.1
Quantum Conﬁguration Spaces
Recall [46] that the spectrum of an abelian C-algebra A consists of all nontrivial
multiplicative linear functionals on A. The Gelfand transform Qa of any a 2 A is
given by
Qa W spec A ! C :

7! .a/
2Parts of Proposition 1 originate in [47].

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
205
The topology on spec A is the initial topology induced by all the Gelfand
transforms. The celebrated Gelfand-Naimark theorem states that a 7! Qa is an
isometric -isomorphism between A and C0.spec A/. If now A is an algebra of
functions on some conﬁguration space X, then the evaluation mapping provides us
with a natural embedding of X into spec A.
Proposition 1 Let X be a set and A  `1.X/ a C-subalgebra with empty kernel.3
Then the natural mapping  W X ! spec A deﬁned by the evaluation mapping
.x/ W A ! C
a 7! a.x/
is well deﬁned and has the following properties:
1. Qa ı  D a for all a 2 A.
2. .X/ is dense in spec A.
3.  and A separate the same points.
4.  is injective ” A separates the points in X.
5.  is continuous ” A consists of continuous functions on X only.
Here, for the ﬁnal assertion, we assumed X to be given some topology.
Proof Well-deﬁnedness follows from the empty-kernel assumption.
1. Observe ŒQa ı .x/  Qa..x// D Œ.x/.a/ D a.x/.
2. Let  2 spec A be outside the closure of .X/. Then, by regularity of locally
compact Hausdorff spaces, there is some  D Qa 2 C0.spec A/ with ./ ¤ 0,
but   0 on .X/. This implies a D Qa ı  D  ı  D 0 and   0.
3. Observe .x/ D .x0/ ” a.x/  .x/.a/ D .x0/.a/  a.x0/ for all a 2 A.
4. This follows immediately from the previous item.
5. By deﬁnition of the Gelfand-Naimark topology,  is continuous iff a  Qa ı  W
X ! C is continuous for all a.
ut
Deﬁnition 2 The quantum conﬁguration space X is the spectrum of A.
We will refer to A as the corresponding quantizing algebra. This algebra
should be rich enough to separate the points of X and to contain sufﬁciently many
physically “interesting” functions. Note, however, that the deﬁnition of X crucially
depends on the choice of A. This will become relevant in loop quantum cosmology.
3The kernel of A is deﬁned by T
a2A a1.0/. In particular, each unital A has empty kernel.
Throughout the whole article, any A will have empty kernel – or we will assume that.

2.2
Lifting Criteria
In the next step, we are going to compare different quantum conﬁguration spaces.
More concretely, we assume to be given two classical conﬁguration spaces X1 and
X2 that are related by some mapping  W X1 ! X2. There are two prime examples
we will be interested in: First, X1 is a subset of X2, given by certain invariant
elements in X2, with  being the canonical embedding; second, both spaces coincide
and  is some isomorphism, e.g., obtained from some group action. How can we
relate the corresponding quantum conﬁguration spaces? A very natural notion is
obviously that of a lift4:
Deﬁnition 3  is a lift of  (w.r.t. some algebras A1 and A2) iff it ﬁlls the diagram

Is there always a lift 
W

X 2 ﬁlling this diagram? Under which
circumstances is  unique? When is it continuous? When injective?
To get an idea how to answer these questions, assume that such a continuous lift
 exists for unital A1. Then, for any a2 2 A2, the function Qa2 ı  W X 1 ! C is
continuous, hence equals Qa1 for some a1 2 A1 by Gelfand-Naimark (and unitality
of A1). Moreover,

This motivates to deﬁne the restriction algebra5 of A2 w.r.t.  by
A2

`1.X1/ :
Thus, we have shown that A2  A1 is necessary for the existence of . But, could
this condition even be sufﬁcient as well?
So, let us assume A2  A1. Then, by Proposition 13, we have

extended to a continuous mapping  on X 1. In particular, it fulﬁlls

Qa2 ı 

for all a2 2 A2. Altogether, we have derived
Proposition 4 For unital A1, there is a continuous lift of  iff A2  A1.
Uniqueness of  is obvious as 1.X1/ is always dense. So, given existence, it
remains to ﬁnd a criterion for injectivity of . For this, observe ﬁrst that we obtain

Lemma 5 If A1 is unital and  exists, then for all x1 2 X 1
.x1/ D x1 ı  :
5To explain the term “restriction algebra”, assume that  is injective, whence X1 can be considered
as a subset of X2. Then A2 consists just of the restrictions of the functions in A2  `1.X2/ to
the domain X1. In order to avoid conﬂicts with the different notion of pull-back C-algebras, we
will use the notion “restriction algebra” also in the case where  is not injective.

This now implies

Consequently,  is injective iff X 1 D spec A1 separates to points in A2  A1,
which is equivalent to the denseness of A2 in A1 by the Stone-Weierstraß and the
Gelfand-Naimark theorems, provided A2 is unital. Altogether, we have
Theorem 6 Let A1 and A2 be unital. Then
 W X1 ! X2 has a continuous injective lift ” A2 is dense in A1
Moreover, the lift is unique if existing.
Note that we did not require  to fulﬁll any continuity condition. Indeed, we get
the continuity of  for free from the C-algebra construction.
For practical purposes, it is often nicer to use the criterion
Corollary 7 Let A1 and A2 be unital, and let B2 be a dense -algebra in A2. Then
we have
 W X1 ! X2 has a continuous injective lift ” B2 is dense in A1
Proof Observe that B2 always equals A2, since

Now the statement follows from Theorem 6 immediately.
ut
These criteria directly suggest what to do if one wants to embed the quantum
conﬁguration space for X1 into that of X2, given some . Simply deﬁne the algebra
A1 to be the completion of A2. We will apply this strategy to the case of loop
quantum cosmology in Sect. 4, where X2 is the conﬁguration space of full gravity
and X1 that of symmetric conﬁgurations describing a certain cosmology. But, before
that, we shall discuss how to lift group actions from any classical conﬁguration space
to its quantum counterpart.
2.3
Functoriality
Having seen how to lift conﬁguration spaces from the classical to the quantum level,
but also how to lift mappings between them, it is very natural to ask whether these

constructions are in some sense functorial. Indeed, they are. Consider the diagram:

Here, our lifting criterion tells us that  exists iff A2  A1 and that  exists iff
A3  A2. Together, we see that the liftability of  and  implies that
. ı /A3

A2

A1;
i.e.,  ı  is liftable as well. From the uniqueness part, we get immediately
 ı  D  ı  :
Finally, even the embedding criterion is functorial. Indeed, assume that  and  lift
to embeddings, i.e., A2 is dense in A1 as well as A3 is dense in A2. Now,
A2

.A3/

implies that . ı /A3 is dense in A1.
2.4
Group Actions
This functoriality immediately allows us to lift group actions. For this, let X be
some set and A be again some C-subalgebra of `1.X/. Recall that a (left) action
of a group S on X consists of mappings 's W X ! X that fulﬁll '1 D id as well
as 's1s2 D 's1 ı 's2 for all s1; s2 2 S. Ignoring continuity or smoothness issues for
the moment, we see that 's can be lifted to the quantum level iff '
s A  A. In order
to lift all 's, we just have to require that A is S-invariant, i.e., '
s A D A for all
s 2 S. Moreover, functoriality shows that 's1s2 D 's1 ı's2. As obviously the identity
is lifted to the identity, we even see that each 's is a homeomorphism on X with
's
1 D 's1. Altogether, we have
Theorem 8 A group action on X lifts to a group action on X iff A is
S-invariant. The lifted group action is even unique, and each group element acts by
homeomorphisms on X fulﬁlling
's.x/ D x ı '
s
(2)
with ' denoting the lifted action of S on X deﬁned by 's WD 's.

210
C. Fleischhack
The issue of continuity is a bit more subtle. For topological groups S, one can
show [38, 39] by methods from C-dynamical systems that ' W S  X ! X is
continuous if s 7! a ı 's is continuous for all a 2 A; the converse is true if A
is unital. Remarkably, this is completely independent from whether ' is continuous
or not. Indeed, in the relevant cases of loop quantum cosmology or loop quantum
gravity the action on the classical level is not necessarily smooth. But even in these
cases, we already get for free that 's is always a homeomorphism.
2.5
Symmetric Sectors
The presence of a group action immediately leads us to the notion of invariant (or
symmetric) elements. Here, the situation is even more interesting: we have group
actions both on the classical and on the quantum level. Can we relate both levels?
To be more speciﬁc, ﬁrst deﬁne the symmetric classical set by
Xred WD fx 2 X j 's.x/ D x
8 s 2 Sg
and, analogously, the symmetric quantum space by
X red WD fx 2 X j 's.x/ D x
8 s 2 Sg :
At the same time, however, we can consider the space Xred of symmetric classical
conﬁgurations as a conﬁguration space in its own right. This has been precisely the
standard way of thinking in loop quantum cosmology. In particular, we can quantize
it given some reasonable abelian C-algebra Ared of bounded functions on it. This
algebra can, in principle, be chosen quite arbitrarily. If, however, one wants to embed
the quantized reduced space Xred into the quantized full space X , one has to deﬁne
Ared by AjXred. It is now natural to ask how the spaces X red and Xred as well as the
closure of .Xred/ in X are related. Here, Xred is considered as a subset of X.
Theorem 9 We have
1. Xred is homeomorphic to .Xred/, provided A is unital.
2. .Xred/ is contained in X red.
3. X red is closed in X .
Note that later we will identify Xred and .Xred/.

hence, by compactness of red.Xred/,
.Xred/

..Xred// D .red.Xred//

.Xred/ :
Now, the proof follows as , by unitality, maps a compact space into a Hausdorff
space, hence is a homeomorphism onto its image.
2. Since 's ı  D  ı 's, each element of .Xred/ is invariant under each 's.
3. If the net .x˛/  X converges to x 2 X, then 's.x˛/ ! 's.x/ by continuity of
's. Closedness of X red is now obvious.
ut
It now remains to decide whether the inclusion relation between Xred and X red is
proper. More literally: can any invariant quantum conﬁguration be approximated
by invariant classical conﬁgurations? Seen functorially on the level of conﬁguration
spaces, this means: do quantization and symmetry implementation commute?
The general answer is – well, it depends. Indeed, we are neither aware of nor have
we been able to so far ﬁnd general conditions that imply commutativity – or non-
commutativity. In loop quantum cosmology, however, the usual answer is negative:
quantization and reduction do not commute. We will discuss this issue in Sect. 4.8.

Loop Quantum Gravity
Having settled the general mathematical framework for the quantization scheme
used in loop quantization, we are now going to apply it to gravity. First, in
Sect. 3.1, we review the classical conﬁguration space of general relativity, both for

metric and for Ashtekar variables. Then, following [8, 24], we describe its loop
quantum counterpart in three equivalent forms: as the spectrum of a C-algebra, as
homomorphisms of the path groupoid and as a projective limit of Lie groups. The
Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure [6] is described in Sect. 3.5, before we conclude
with an explicit example [24] of an element of the quantum conﬁguration space and
with the discussion of the underlying smoothness category.
3.1
Classical Conﬁguration Space
As we have learned in Sect. 2, we need two pieces of information to deﬁne the
quantum conﬁguration space of a physical theory: the classical conﬁguration space
X and some algebra A of bounded functions thereon. Let us start with the classical
conﬁguration space, now for gravity.
Metric Variables
Classical gravity, or general relativity, is described by a spacetime metric g fulﬁlling
the Einstein equations G C ƒg D 8T. Here, a spacetime metric is a metric of
Lorentzian signature on a 4-dimensional, connected, time-oriented and oriented
manifold. Moreover, the Einstein tensor G is deﬁned by G WD R  1
2Rscalg, with
R and Rscal being the Ricci and the scalar curvatures of g, respectively. Finally, ƒ is
the cosmological constant and T is the stress-energy tensor. We will set both terms
to zero, this way restricting ourselves to matter-free gravity in the vacuum.
Conceptually, general relativity is a covariant theory. Technically, it requires to
solve a nonlinear partial differential equation. At the same time, it is desirable to
formulate general relativity as an initial value problem, i.e. as a canonical theory.
However, canonical theories require some distinguished time variable, not naturally
given in relativistic theories. Nevertheless, there is a class of spacetimes that admit
a well-posed initial value formulation, namely globally hyperbolic spacetimes [54].
Originally, this notion had referred to the causal structure of the spacetime metric.
According to the celebrated results by Bernal and Sánchez [16, 17], it is equivalent
to the assumption that the spacetime manifold M is diffeomorphic to R  † for
some 3-manifold † and that the Lorentzian metric is given by f d2Cq for some
smooth families f and q of functions and Riemannian metrics on †, respectively.
Moreover, each level set † WD fg  † is then a Cauchy surface; usually, one
simply identiﬁes † with †0.
Now, given global hyperbolicity, we can consider Einstein’s equations as an
initial-value problem. For this, one ﬁrst observes that any spacetime metric on M
can be uniquely reconstructed from its restriction q to † and from the second
fundamental form (or, extrinsic curvature) K describing the shape of † as a

213
submanifold of M. Einstein’s equations transfer to some evolution equations for
q and K, but also imply that these two objects have to fulﬁll certain constraint
equations, namely the diffeomorphism constraint and the Hamilton constraint. They
encode the invariance of the theory under spatial and temporal diffeomorphisms. It
is a very remarkable result that our initial-value problem can now be solved at least
locally [34, 48, 50] iff these constraints are met. One can even show that the metric
q on † and some expression being linear (up to some weight) in K are canonically
conjugate variables. Thus, we can consider the space of Riemannian 3-metrics on †
as the (unconstrained) conﬁguration space of canonical general relativity.7
Ashtekar Variables
The conﬁguration space of Riemannian metrics became the starting point of the
Wheeler-DeWitt approach to quantum gravity. Its idea was basically to consider
quantum gravity as quantum mechanics of metrics, with the Hamilton constraint
inducing the Hamiltonian. Technically, the non-polynomiality of the Hamilton
constraint, however, was a big issue. In the 1980s, Ashtekar [2, 3] tried to cure
that problem introducing new variables, now carrying his name.
First, he encoded the metric by means of triads. Of course, each triad determines
a metric by requiring it to be oriented orthonormal. However, the other direction
is not unique. In fact, each metric admits a whole bunch of oriented orthonormal
triads; more precisely, two triads give the same metric iff they are related by some
SO.3/ element.
Second, he introduced a covariant derivative (or, Ashtekar connection) rA on †.
As triads comprise the information on the metric, the covariant derivative contains
that on the second fundamental form. For this, recall that the latter one is the
quadratic form deﬁned by the Weingarten mapping W with W.X/ WD 4rXn. Here,
n is the normal to † within .M; g/, and 4r is the Levi-Civita connection on .M; g/.
Now, the Ashtekar connection is deﬁned by [30, 33]
rA
XY WD rXY C ˇ W.X/  Y :
Here, the vector product has been transferred from R3 to T† using a q-orthonormal
triad. The complex number ˇ is a parameter [15, 42] of the theory and is called
Barbero-Immirzi parameter.
Ashtekar observed that the connection and the triad form a canonical pair of
variables. At the same time, there appeared an additional constraint, the so-called
Gauß constraint that originates in the gauge freedom introduced via replacing
metrics by triads. This, however, is no big deal as now, having connections as

phisms. This leads to the so-called superspace. However, its mathematical structure is rather
complicated [36].

C. Fleischhack
variables, we are in the realm of gauge ﬁeld theories. There, gauge invariance as
incorporated by the Gauß constraint can be tamed rather easily. The big advantage
of the original Ashtekar variables became apparent, when the Hamilton constraint
was calculated: for ˇ D ˙i, it is polynomial. This triggered the hope for a successful
and rigorous canonical quantization of pure general relativity. However, as physical
theories shall produce real numbers rather than complex ones, the choice of ˇ D ˙i
forced Ashtekar to introduce quite complicated reality conditions. It took about
10 years until Thiemann [51, 52] realized that the non-polynomiality which had
remained for ˇ ¤ ˙i, can be expressed by means of the Poisson bracket and some
appropriate volume function.
For our purposes, however, these considerations are less relevant. We are going
to study the conﬁguration space only – neither the phase space nor the constraints.
Thus, the main lesson we should keep in mind, is: general relativity, using
Ashtekar’s variables, can be formulated as a gauge ﬁeld theory, i.e., its conﬁguration
space is spanned by the covariant derivatives on T†. Alternatively, one can consider
T† as an vector bundle that is associated to any8 spin bundle over †. The latter one
is always an SU.2/ principal ﬁber bundle over †. Its connections are in one-to-
one correspondence with covariant derivatives on the tangent bundle over †. – To
summarize:
Deﬁnition 10 Let G be a connected compact Lie group, let M be some manifold,
and let P be some G-principal ﬁber bundle over M. Then A denotes the set of all
connections in P.
Now, the classical conﬁguration space of canonical general relativity is the
set of all connections in an SU.2/ principal ﬁber bundle over some 3-dimensional
manifold. Until the end of this section, however, we will not restrict ourselves to
G D SU.2/ and dim M D 3, but use A in the broader sense of the deﬁnition above.
Remark 11
1. Notably, for ˇ ¤ ˙i, the resulting gauge theory does no longer correspond to a
space-time gauge ﬁeld theory, as the Ashtekar connection cannot be extended to
a full space-time connection [49].
2. Neither for gravity nor for cosmology we will discuss the issue of gauge
transforms, although the space of connections modulo gauge transforms usually
serves as conﬁguration space of gauge theories. However, a careful implementa-
tion of gauge transforms into our framework is still lacking. Nevertheless, we do
not expect severe problems. But, the presentation would probably be much more
technical, whence we would have focused just on spaces of connections anyway.
8There are spin structures, hence spin bundles, as † is orientable [43].

3.2
Quantum Conﬁguration Space
Having settled the classical conﬁguration space A for general relativity, we now
have to select an appropriate algebra of functions on A. Here, the motivation comes
from lattice gauge ﬁeld theories. There, rather than connections themselves, one
considers parallel transports along the bonds of a lattice that is typically cubic. Here,
we will now consider parallel transports just along arbitrary paths. Indeed, one can
reconstruct a connection as soon as one knows all of its parallel transports.
Using all parallel transports, however, is technically a bit more subtle than in
usual lattice gauge ﬁeld theory. There, one always (at least implicitly) assumes to
be given some (possibly global) trivialization of the bundle. This allows parallel
transports to be just elements of the structure group. Actually, parallel transports are
mappings h;A W P.0/ ! P.1/ from the ﬁber over the starting point to the ﬁber
over the end point of the path  under consideration. Of course, each ﬁber is (non-
canonically) isomorphic to the structure group G; for instance, choosing .m/ in the
ﬁber Pm over m, we get such an isomorphism G ! Pm via g 7! .m/g. Only
now, as the mappings h;A commute with the right action of the structure group, one
can identify them with elements of G via h;A...0/// D ..1//hs
.A/. Here, the
set-theoretic global section9  W M ! P is any function with  ı  D idM for
 W P ! M the canonical projection.
Considering parallel transports as elements in G rather than equivariant mappings
between ﬁbers, indeed, is much more convenient for our purposes. In fact, as G is
assumed compact, h
 can now be considered as a mapping from A to G, whose
matrix element functions are bounded functions on A – exactly the structures we
need for our algebra.
Deﬁnition 12 Fix some set-theoretic global section in P and let B contain precisely
the functions f ı h
 W A ! C, with f W G ! C running over the matrix
functions10 and  running over all analytic paths in M. Then A is set to be the
unital C-subalgebra of `1.A/ generated by B.
In the loop quantum gravity literature, B (or, often, some slightly larger subsets
of A) is usually referred to as the set of cylindrical functions. Note that A does
not depend on the choice of the set-theoretic section . In fact, if 	 is another
section, there are some gx; gy 2 G, such that h
.A/ D g1
y h	
 .A/gx for all A and
all  connecting x and y. Now, it is clear that we get the same A in both situations.
In the following, we will tacitly assume to have ﬁxed some set-theoretic section for
calculating parallel transport functions, and simply write h instead of h
.
9Note that we do not require  to even be a local section in the bundle sense. In fact,  need not be
continuous; this is referred to by noting “set-theoretic” [26].
10We assume to have ﬁxedly chosen G as a Lie subgroup of some U.n/.

216
C. Fleischhack
According to Sect. 2, now the quantum conﬁguration space of canonical
general relativity in the loop approach is the spectrum of A. This is a compact
Hausdorff space and denoted by A. Its elements are called generalized connections.
By Proposition 12 it contains A as a dense subspace.
3.3
Groupoid Homomorphisms
At a ﬁrst glance, spectra of abelian C-algebras need not look easily accessible.
This, however, is not true for the set A of generalized connections.
For this, let us go back to the case of “classical” connections or better their
parallel transports. So far, we have always considered them as functions from
A to G, indexed by the paths in M. Now, we will consider them as mappings
hA W P ! G from the set P of paths to G indexed by the connections. Of course,
hA will be smooth in a certain sense, but that is not the property most relevant
for us. Instead, hA is multiplicative. In fact, given a path  cut in two pieces 1
and 2, the parallel transports obey hA./  hA.12/ D hA.1/hA.2/. Similarly,
hA.1/ D hA./1, for 1 being the path  passed in the opposite direction.
Thus, giving the set P of analytic paths the structure of a groupoid,11 each hA is a
homomorphism from P to G. And this is the key to the spectrum, giving
Proposition 13 A is isomorphic to Hom.P; G/.
This means, A consists of all homomorphisms, not just the sort-of-smooth ones.
The isomorphism itself is rather simply described. For this, note that we may extend
A 2 A to
A
W
A ˝ Cnn ! Cnn;
with our compact G embedded into U.n/  Cnn. Then we just have
A.h/ D A./;
where the right-hand A W P ! G is the homomorphismthat corresponds to the left-
hand A 2 A (extended as above). That the mapping above is indeed an isomorphism
follows from the homomorphy of parallel transports, and as h equals hı iff  and ı
coincide up to the parametrization.
We will identify A and Hom.P; G/ in the following.
11For this, one has to identify paths that coincide up to their parametrization.

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
217
3.4
Projective Limits
Beyond the formulations of A via C-algebras and via path groupoids, there is a
third one using projective limits. For this, consider any analytic graph , i.e., a ﬁnite
graph whose edges are analytic paths i. Any such  deﬁnes a surjective continuous
mapping h W A ! Gn via h.A/ D .A.1/; : : : ; A.n//. These mappings h can
be seen as canonical projections of an appropriate projective limit.
Indeed, we deﬁne an ordering on the set of analytic paths as follows. We say
 	 ı iff any edge in  can be decomposed into edges of ı or their inverses.
Corresponding to these decompositions, we deﬁne a projection
ı
 W G#ı ! G# :
For instance, if 1 D ı1ı2 and 2 D ı1
3 , then ı
.g1; g2; g3/ D .g1g2; g1
3 /. As
ı
 ı "
ı D "

for  	 ı 	 ",
these mappings form a projective system. One can easily show that
Proposition 14 A is homeomorphic to lim
  G via A 7!

h.A/

.
In particular, the canonical projections of the projective limit are just the h.
3.5
Ashtekar-Lewandowski Measure
One of the main breakthroughs of loop quantum gravity was not only the deﬁnition
of a compact quantum conﬁguration space for general relativity, but even more
the rigorous construction of a normalized Radon measure thereon, namely the
Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure. Its construction is very easy using the projective
limit framework, given the underlying ordering is directed which is the case for
analytic graphs. Recall that then the normalized Radon measures on a projective
limit are in one-to-one correspondence to consistent families of normalized Radon
measures on the constituents of the limit. In our case, this means that the measures
on A correspond to families .	/ of measures on the G# that fulﬁll
	 D .ı
/	ı
for all  	 ı.
The most obvious choice is to let each 	 be the normalized Haar measure. Indeed,
this family is consistent and corresponds to the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure
	AL. This measure underlies all the constructions in loop quantum gravity. In
particular, it provides us with a kinematical Hilbert space L2.A; 	AL/.

218
C. Fleischhack
Of course, there are many more measures on A, but the choice of the Ashtekar-
Lewandowski measure is indeed natural. There are strong uniqueness results that
single out 	AL. In particular, up to some technical assumptions like regularity and
cyclicity, both the holonomy-ﬂux algebra [44] and the Weyl algebra [29] can be
represented only on L2.A; 	AL/ in a diffeomorphism-covariant way.
3.6
Explicit Example
Having laid out the theory, we should show that we have made a nontrivial extension
of the classical conﬁguration space. So let us explicitly construct generalized, but
non-smooth connections. For this, ﬁx some path ı as well as some g 2 G, and
let n./ tell us how often  passes an initial segment of ı (counted negatively if
passed in the other direction). Now, Ag./ WD gn./ is a well-deﬁned generalized
connection. If, for simplicity, we assume P to be trivial, then it is a smooth
connection iff g D 1, showing that A is properly contained in A. For general P,
the argumentation is similar.
3.7
Paths
When deﬁning A to be the quantum conﬁguration space, we have assumed without
further comment that the algebra A is generated by the parallel transport functions
along all analytic paths in M. Why have we done this? Why have we not used further
paths? Why have we not restricted ourselves to smaller classes?
Well, ﬁrst of all, analytic objects behave very nicely. Indeed, if two analytic
paths have inﬁnitely many intersection points, they have to coincide on full intervals
which may even be taken maximal. This implies that two analytic graphs are always
subgraphs of a third analytic graph, i.e., the ordering on analytic graphs introduced
above is direct. This has turned out crucial for the construction of measures.
Of course, one has to grant that one can weaken the smoothness requirements the
paths are to fulﬁll. For that purpose, webs [13, 14, 27, 28] in the smooth category or
hyphs [25] in the arbitrary Ck categories have been introduced and widely studied.
Indeed, signiﬁcant parts of the theory have been transferred. Nevertheless, the use
of paths that are non-analytic, has lead to enormous technical difﬁculties. Thus, it is
at least a matter of convenience to choose the analytic category for all the manifolds,
bundles, and paths in the game.
Conceptually, there is even a further justiﬁcation for choosing analytic paths.
Actually, general relativity seems to contradict analyticity, as the former one is a
local, the latter one a non-local structure. However, this puzzle can be resolved
using semianalytic structures [29, 40, 44, 45] rather than analytic ones. Indeed,
semianalyticity provides us with non-local, i.e. non-rigid structures. Even more,

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
219
the loop quantum gravity uniqueness theorems mentioned above work in the
semianalytic framework. For paths, semianalytic just means piecewise analytic,
which is the same as to admit the concatenation of analytic paths. At the same time,
the C-algebra A generated by the analytic paths is the same as those generated by
piecewise analytic paths. Therefore, at the level of graphs it is completely justiﬁed
to restrict oneself to analytic paths.
It remains to discuss whether we might further restrict the set of paths, say to
straight lines when the base manifold is R3. Indeed, there is no obstruction to do
this. One just has to guarantee that with any admissible path all of its subpaths as
well as its inverse are admissible. These issues will become relevant in cosmological
models and will be discussed in more detail in Sect. 4.5.

Homogeneous Isotropic Loop Quantum Cosmology
Now we are going to apply our results to the case of k D 0 homogeneous isotropic
cosmology. After recalling the implications of homogeneity and isotropy as well as
explaining k, we will state the space of classical invariant connections. Then we will
investigate the algebra of functions whose spectrum can be continuously embedded
into the full space of generalized connections, in the analytic case. We also discuss
other smoothness categories focusing on their embedding properties. Afterwards,
we review the invariance of measures and close with the noncommutativity of
symmetry reduction and quantization.
4.1
Euclidean Group Action
In general, homogeneity and isotropy imply that the sectional curvature k of the
metric on the Cauchy surface † is constant [54]. If k even vanishes, then † is
necessarily covered by R3. As we will assume that the Cauchy surface is even
simply connected, † equals the Euclidean R3. Homogeneity and isotropy now mean
that our theory shall be invariant under all rigid motions, hence w.r.t. the connected
component E of the Euclidean group in 3 dimensions.
As we are going to study gravity and cosmology in their formulations using
Ashtekar variables, we have to consider now connections in an SU.2/-principal
ﬁber bundle P over † D R3. As † is contractible, the bundle is trivial, hence
P D †  SU.2/. The delicate point is how to lift the action of the Euclidean group
from † to P and to the connections in P. The action on the †-part, of course, remains
to be the deﬁning action of the Euclidean group E. But, how to act on the SU.2/-
part? Here, one should assume that not only E is acting, but even its covering group,
which is homeomorphic to R3  S3. Finally, this leads to the following situation
[38]:

220
C. Fleischhack
Deﬁnition 15 The symmetry group of k D 0 homogeneous isotropic cosmology
is
S D R3 Ì SU.2/ :
It acts from the left on P D R3  SU.2/ via

Here, SU.2/ acts on R3 via ﬁrst projecting SU.2/ to SO.3/ by the covering map.
More explicitly, we have Œryii D Adr.yjj/ for any su.2/ basis fig with Œi; j D

ij m.
4.2
Invariant Connections
In the next step, we have to identify the elements of Ared, i.e. the connections in P
that are invariant under the action of the symmetry group S on P.
Proposition 16 Ared is isomorphic to R. More precisely,
Ared D f C c  j c 2 Rg
with  being the Maurer-Cartan form on G D SU.2/ and with  being the su.2/-
valued one-form on P given by
.x;g/ D Adg i ˝ dxi
for all .x; g/ 2 P :
That the forms above are indeed invariant forms, can be calculated immediately.
More elaborate is the proof that there are not any other invariant forms [38].
The more common version of the forms above is given by their pullbacks c i˝dxi
to the base manifold using the canonical section into the trivial bundle P D R3 
SU.2/.
4.3
Quantizing Algebra
Recall that we are aiming at constructing a version of loop quantum cosmology
whose conﬁguration space can be embedded into that of full loop quantum gravity.
Therefore, we have to deﬁne the cosmological cylindrical functions as the restric-
tions of the gravitational cylindrical functions (see Deﬁnition 12) to Ared  A. For
this, let us study ﬁrst how parallel transports depend on Ared.

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
221
Let there be given a connection A 2 A. We identify A with the corresponding
connection one-form on M that one gets via pullback along the standard section in
P; recall that P is trivial. Moreover, let  W Œ0; 1 ! M be some path in M and let
t be its restriction to Œ0; t. Finally, denote by g.t/ WD hA.t/ the parallel transport
along t. Then g obeys the differential equation
Pg D A. P/ g

g.0/ D 1 .
(3)
Specializing to  C c 2 Ared Š R, any matrix function a of g fulﬁlls [21]

(4)
for certain f0; f1 2 CŒ0; 1 that can be expressed using P; moreover, a.0/ 2 C and
Pa.0/ 2 C C cC depend on . One can show that f0 and f1 vanish iff  is a straight
line; they are constant iff  is a spiral arc, comprising the cases of straight lines and
circles [21, 23].
In particular, we have now learned that the cosmological, i.e. reduced quantizing
algebra Ared is generated by the functions c 7! a.t/, whereas a solves (4), t runs
over Œ0; 1, and  (which determines coefﬁcients and initial values for (4)) runs over
all analytic paths in R3. Note that a, of course, depends on c via (4).
Let us calculate Ared. First consider straight lines. Here, (4) has the simple form
RaCc2a D 0. Hence, a.t/ is a linear combination of eitc and eitc. Carefully handling
the possible initial values, we see that any character c 7! eitc is contained in Ared.
If, next, we look at circles with radius 1=.2/, (4) leads to Ra C .c2 C 2/a D 0
(after some t-dependent rescaling of a, irrelevant for our purposes). Its solutions a
can be written as a linear combination of exponentials of ˙it
p
c2 C 2. Focusing
on their c-dependence, we see that for large c they behave like periodic functions.
A more careful investigation shows that a.t/ is indeed a linear combination of a
character of R and a function vanishing at inﬁnity. Again, exhausting all  > 0 and
handling the initial values properly, we see that we can even approximate any sum
of this type. This shows that Ared at least contains CAP.R/ C C0.R/, i.e. all sums
of an almost periodic function and a function vanishing at inﬁnity. It is not very
difﬁcult, but technically a bit more elaborate to show that these sums even comprise
all possibilities [23]:
Proposition 17 The quantizing algebra for loop quantum cosmology is
Ared D C0.R/ C CAP.R/ :
Note that Ared is indeed a C-algebra [33, 46].

222
C. Fleischhack
4.4
Generalized Invariant Connections
Our next task is to determine the spectrum R  Ared of Ared [31]. If the sum of
C0.R/ and CAP.R/ was direct in the sense of C-algebras, this would be an easy
game. However, obviously, this is not the case; the sum is only direct in the sense of
vector spaces. Nevertheless, there is a bit beyond nothing. Indeed, observe that both
algebras are C-subalgebras of `1.R/ with C0.R/ even being an ideal. This already
sufﬁces to show that the spectrum of Ared as a set equals the disjoint sum of the two
single spectra, namely R and the Bohr compactiﬁcation RBohr, respectively. To see
this, deﬁne

we see that  W R t RBohr ! R is well deﬁned. It is not very difﬁcult to show that
 is even bijective, whence we will identify R with R t RBohr.
The determination of the topology of R, however, is more elaborate [31]. As the
sum of C0.R/ and CAP.R/ is not direct, we cannot expect the topology to be the
disjoint-sum topology. Indeed, it is not. Instead, it is twisted. It is generated by the
following types of sets:
Type 1:
V t ¿
with open V  R
Type 2:
{K t RBohr
with compact K  R
Type 3: a1
1 .U/ t Qa1
1 .U/ with open U  C and a1 2 CAP.R/.
Nevertheless, the relative topologies on R and RBohr considered as subsets of R are
the usual ones. Also, R is open and dense in R. Moreover, the canonical mapping
red W R ! R  R t RBohr is the identity on R. Finally, as Ared is unital, R is
compact as desired.
4.5
Embeddings
By construction, R is continuously embedded into A extending the natural embed-
ding of R  Ared into A. In fact, as we have deﬁned Ared to be generated by

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
223
the parallel transport matrix functions restricted to Ared, the embedding criterion of
Corollary 7 is fulﬁlled automatically. However, there are also other versions of loop
quantum cosmology that have been discussed in the literature. They differ from our
strategy by using different quantizing algebras. Indeed, the original way Bojowald
invented loop quantum cosmology was to consider parallel transports along straight
lines only. As we have seen above, these functions span the algebra of almost
periodic functions whose spectrum is RBohr. However, CAP.R/ does not fulﬁll the
embedding criterion of Corollary 7. In fact, we have seen that AjAred is not contained
in CAP.R/ although that is a necessary condition for embeddability.
Of course, these arguments are only valid assuming that the quantizing algebra
for loop quantum gravity is indexed by all analytic graphs. Over the years, however,
several other choices have been discussed: smooth paths [13, 14, 27], Ck paths
[25], piecewise linear paths [22, 56], paths in a ﬁxed graph [35], or paths given by
iterated barycentric subdivisions [1]. Similarly, in the cosmological arena piecewise
linear paths [19, 22], parts of a ﬁxed geodesic [19] or just two paths having
incommensurable lengths [53] have been investigated. We have displayed in Table 1
for each combination whether the classical embedding Ared  A does lift to
the quantum level (C) or does not (). Note that we have excluded the gravity
cases based on a ﬁxed graph or barycentric subdivisions, as there the quantizing
algebras do, in general, not separate the classical conﬁguration space [23], whence
 W A ! A is not injective there. It should now be no surprise that a continuous
embedding is given if and only if the classes of paths used for the gravitational and
for the cosmological theories coincide [23].
Consequently, the strategy presented above, i.e. deﬁning the quantized algebras
for gravity and cosmology using identical sets of paths is the only way to get
embeddability. This, however, does not tell us a priori whether the choice for
cosmology should follow that for gravity or vice versa. Indeed, in order to keep
Bojowald’s original straight-line cosmology, it has been argued [22] that one should
restrict oneself to straight lines already at gravity level. We, however, think that this
is not desirable as then other symmetries might not be treatable within full gravity.
Therefore, we prefer our strategy “cosmology follows gravity”.

In order to deﬁne a kinematical Hilbert space and to then obtain quantum states,
one should look for ﬁnite measures on the respective quantum conﬁguration space.
For full gravity, the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure 	AL on A turned out to be
the measure distinguished by strong uniqueness results [29, 44]. In Bojowald’s
cosmology, the Haar measure on RBohr adopted that role [4]. What could now be
the measure of choice in our version of loop quantum cosmology?
Well, the easiest way would be to choose a Haar measure on the quantum
conﬁguration space R D R t RBohr. However, as Hanusch [39] pointed out, R
does not carry the structure of a topological group compatible with that on R. No
group structure – no Haar measure.
Thus, maybe we should lower our sights. Indeed, a Haar measure does not exploit
the full structure of a topological group. Instead, it is deﬁned to be invariant w.r.t.
the left translation of the group on itself. For the Bohr compactiﬁcation, we even
need less than full invariance:
Lemma 18 Any ﬁnite R-invariant Radon measure on RBohr is already RBohr-
invariant.
Proof Let U be a neighborhood in RBohr of some compact K that fulﬁlls 	.U/ <
	.K/ C ", and let b 2 RBohr. By denseness of R in the compact group RBohr, there
is some c 2 R with b C K  c C U, whence by R-invariance
	.b C K/
	
	.c C U/
D
	.U/
<
	.K/ C " :
This gives 	.b C K/ D 	.K/. Now the proof follows from regularity.
ut
On the other hand, using the general strategy from Sect. 2.4, the R-action on RBohr
can be considered as the lift of the standard R-action on R. For this, just observe that
RBohr is nothing but the quantum conﬁguration space for X D R and quantizing
algebra CAP.R/. But, why should we look for R-invariant measures at all? Well,
for the same reason as in full gravity. In fact, the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure
is invariant under all exponentiated ﬂuxes. In cosmology, their counterpart is just
translations by real numbers. Therefore, it is very natural to ask for R-invariant
measures in the cosmological case. The Haar measure, as shown above, is indeed the
only candidate in Bojowald’s construction of loop quantum cosmology; in fact, here
the quantizing algebra has been CAP.R/. In our framework, however, the quantizing
algebra is Ared D C0.R/ C CAP.R/. Do we get an R-action there as well? Yes,
of course. Theorem 8 tells us that the only condition is the R-invariance of Ared,
which is obviously given. Even more, as the action preserves the direct sum C0.R/C
CAP.R/, the restriction of the R-action on R to its components R and RBohr coincides

with the respective standard action. Finally, x 7! L
x a which maps R to Ared, is
continuous for all a 2 Ared [38], whence the R-action on R is continuous as well by
the closing remark in Sect. 2.4.
Now, we are left with just a ﬁnal observation: although the topology of R D
R t RBohr is not that of the disjoint sum, the Borel algebra of R is the disjoint sum
of the Borel algebras of R and of RBohr. This implies that the ﬁnite Radon measures
on R are the sums of ﬁnite Radon measures on R and on RBohr [31, 38].
Proposition 19 The Haar measure on the RBohr-part is the only normalized Radon
measure on R that is R-invariant [38].
Proof Let 	 D 	0C	1 be such a measure on R D RtRBohr. Setting I D Œ0; 1/, we
have 1  	0.R/ D P
n2Z 	0.n C I/ D P
Z 	0.I/ by R-invariance, which implies
	0 D 0. As now 	1 is R-invariant, the proof follows from Lemma 18.
ut
This proposition has an astonishing consequence: it reconciles the original approach
by Bojowald with that discussed here – both lead to the same kinematical Hilbert
space. Our approach, however, has the advantage that it is functorial. This means
that we can guarantee for a continuous embedding of the conﬁguration spaces being
a fundamental step in the Bojowald-Kastrup construction [20] of symmetric states
in loop quantum gravity.
The bridge between loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology that had
been destroyed by the non-embedding results [21] of Brunnemann and the author,
has now been rebuilt at another place.
4.7
Invariant Generalized Connections
So far, we have studied loop quantum cosmology as the quantum theory of the
cosmological sector of gravity. In other words, we have ﬁrst reduced the theory and
then quantized. Does this give the same result as ﬁrst quantizing and then reducing?
In other words, is loop quantum cosmology the homogeneous isotropic sector of
full loop quantum gravity?
From the general theory we know that we can lift the action of the classical
symmetry group S on A to an action on A. The generalized connections that are
invariant w.r.t. the lifted action form the space Ared which is a closed, hence compact
subset of A. Considering Ared as a subset of A, we already know that Ared is a subset
of Ared by Theorem 9. The ﬁnal question of this section is now: do both spaces even
coincide or not?12
12The results of Sects. 4.7 and 4.8 can, in principle, be found in the very voluminous and interesting
thesis [38] by Hanusch. Here, however, we have drastically simpliﬁed and streamlined notations,
statement presentations and proofs.

Invariant Homomorphisms
Before we will solve this problem in Sect. 4.8, we should ﬁrst go back to the level
of classical connections and re-consider the action of S on parallel transports. Using
the fact that parallel transports (in the sense of mappings between ﬁbers) commute
with the right action of the structure group, it is a straightforward calculation that
the action of S on A 2 A gives
h.'
s A/ D r1 hs.A/r
for all s D .x; r/ 2 S and paths  2 P.
As A is dense in A, the action of S lifts to an action on A D Hom.P; G/ with

s ı A./ D r1 A.s/ r
for all s D .x; r/ 2 S and paths  2 P.
Thus, we have determined the set Ared of S-invariant generalized connections:
Proposition 20 A generalized connection A 2 A is S-invariant iff
A.s/ D r A./r1
(7)
for all s D .x; r/ 2 S and all paths13  2 P.
Straight Lines
Let us study how the proposition above restricts the possible parallel transports
along straight lines. First of all, observe that shifting any path by some ﬁxed R3
element does not alter the parallel transport at all. Thus, we may restrict ourselves
to the lines v.t/ WD tv through the origin (w.l.o.g., v ¤ 0). Fix now some A 2 Ared
and some v 2 R3 and denote the parallel transport of A along v from 0 to t
by g.t/. Using the just obtained shift invariance and the homomorphy property of
generalized connections, we see that g W R ! SU.2/ is a one-parameter subgroup
of SU.2/. Observe, however, that g need not be continuous. As R is commutative,
the image of g is abelian, hence contained in a maximal torus. This means, it
factorizes into g D T ı b with b W R ! S1 being a (possibly non-continuous)
homomorphism, and T W S1 ! SU.2/ (a Lie embedding of) a maximal torus in
SU.2/. Using Pontryagin duality, we might identify b with an element of RBohr.
Can we further restrict the possible tori? Yes, we can. Observe that v is stabilized
by all r 2 SU.2/ with rv D v. These elements correspond to rotations exp.tvii/
around the axis deﬁned by v ¤ 0. They span a maximal torus Tv; seen as an
13In order not to overload the notation, we refrain from writing “paths modulo reparametrization”,
here and in the following. Indeed, it should be clear that and how the action of S transfers to these
equivalence classes.

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
227
embedding, it is given by
Tv W S1 ! SU.2/
with
T0
v D ivii:
By (7), however, this torus has to commute with all g.t/. Thus, if we assume for a
moment that g is not central this implies T D Tv. But, if g is central, we can and
will choose T D Tv as well. Altogether, we have g D Tv ıb, and the only remaining
freedom is the choice of b.
Symmetries of Paths
It is now very desirable to learn more about the restrictions that (7) imposes on
arbitrary paths. Basically, there are two constraints: ﬁrst the requirement to have
a homomorphism, and second to have an invariant one. For straight lines, we
can see immediately their consequences: the ﬁrst one implies that b has to be
a homomorphism, the second one implies that the torus T must be Tv. Similar
statements can also be found for several other curves; see, e.g., the thesis of
Hanusch [38] for a comprehensive treatment.
There, Hanusch starts his investigations by exploiting the invariance relations
ﬁrst. The crucial question is: which paths are in some sense independent from each
other? In other words, when can a path be mapped by some element of the symmetry
group S to itself, or at least when do they overlap? For this, obviously, one has to
investigate the symmetry behavior of analytic paths. Basically, there are (at least)
two sort-of independent types [38].
1. There are paths  that exhibit a continuous symmetry (Lie paths).
They are given by (subpaths of) .t/ D etXx where X lies in the Lie algebra
of S and x is in M. These are just the integral curves of the fundamental vector
ﬁelds induced by the symmetry group action on M.
2. There are paths  that exhibit a discrete symmetry (brick paths).
Here, we have (modulo the stabilizer of ) at most ﬁnitely many elements
s 2 S for which s and  share a common subpath. In particular, such a  has a
subpath that has no accumulation point with any of its S-translates.
Recently, the author of the present review has proven that these paths indeed
comprise all possible types in the homogeneous isotropic case; even more, this
statement remains true for all symmetry group actions that are pointwise proper
and analytic [32]. Moreover, it is known [38] that the types above are stable
w.r.t. decomposition and inversion of paths, and, of course, there is no symmetry
mapping a path from one class into another. Therefore, the parallel transports can
be assigned to paths in different classes completely independently (although there
remain constraints within the classes), which induces a product structure on Ared.
For the Lie curves, one can go even further. Indeed, also there one can introduce
a notion of independence which tells us basically that the respective curves do not
share full segments. Recall that any Lie curve is induced by some element in the Lie

228
C. Fleischhack
algebra s of S. Therefore, via independence, the algebraic relations in (7) induce
an equivalence relation on s. As non-equivalent paths can be assigned parallel
transports independently, this again reﬁnes the product structure of Ared. Within
the factors, the problem is reduced to the constraints on parallel transports of the
respective equivalence class. Finally, Hanusch obtained
Ared D RBohr 

red ;
(8)
where  indicates some sort of projectivation. Observe that the ﬁrst factor RBohr is
exactly the freedom that has remained for choosing parallel transports along straight
lines (see above). The other paths require a more elaborate discussion.
4.8
Reduction vs. Quantization
Finally, let us show that Ared is indeed larger than Ared. The basic idea is to show
that there are just two connections in Ared that have trivial parallel transports along
all straight lines, but inﬁnitely many in Ared.
Let us begin with the parallel transports for generalized invariant connections.
For this, let ﬁrst c 2 R and denote the straight line connecting 0 and tv by t. Recall
that c corresponds to the smooth invariant connection .c/   Cc 2 Ared, having
local one-form A D ci ˝dxi, hence A. P/ D c Pii. Thus, the corresponding parallel
transport along t is, by (3),
ht..c// D ectvii

Tv.eict/

Tv.t.c// :
(9)
For general c 2 R, the parallel transport of .c/ 2 Ared along t is given by
Œ.c/.t/ D Œ.c/.ht/
(A./ D A.h/ as A D Hom.P; G//

(.c/ D c ı  by Lemma 5/
D c.Tv ı t/
(see (9)/
D ŒTv ı c.t/
(algebras extended by Cnn/:
This shows immediately that 0 2 R and 0Bohr 2 RBohr are the only elements in R
for which the parallel transports along all straight lines are 1 (see (5) and (6)).
Let us now turn to the construction of a bunch of invariant generalized connec-
tions having trivial parallel transports along all straight lines. For every homomor-
phism b W R ! S1 deﬁne a generalized connection Ab by
Ab./ WD
(

if  does not pass a circular arc

if  has length t and rotates in direction n:

Kinematical Foundations of Loop Quantum Cosmology
229
Here, “in direction” n means that the rotation axis is parallel to n. Moreover, the
“length” t is set negative if  rotates according the left-hand rule.14 As Tn and b are
homomorphisms, Ab is in A. In particular, it is trivial on all straight lines. However,
it is also S-invariant: First, if  is not circular, then neither does any s; hence both
the parallel transports on  and on s are trivial, whence the invariance condition (7)
is trivially fulﬁlled. Second, if  rotates in direction n with length t, then s rotates
in direction rn with length t, as s D .x; r/ 2 S is an isometry. Now, (7) follows
as Tsn D Adr ıTn. This shows that Ab is in Ared for all b. And now it is clear that
there are more than two connections in Ared that are trivial along straight lines. This
proves
Theorem 21 We have Ared  Ared.
Thus, we have shown for the homogeneous isotropic case:
Quantization and symmetry reduction do not commute.

Conclusions
In our article, we have reviewed the mathematical theory underlying the conﬁgu-
ration space constructions of loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology.
Beginning with abstractly discussing the C-algebraic mathematical foundations
of loop quantization in general, we have ﬁnally seen that loop quantization and
symmetry reduction do not commute for homogeneous isotropic cosmology.
It is now natural to ask about other symmetries. Indeed, again Hanusch [38]
has already obtained several, at least partial results for spherically symmetric, for
homogeneous and for semihomogeneous cosmologies. He was able to calculate all
smooth invariant connections [37]; for the spherically symmetric case, this required
methods beyond the classical results by Wang [55] or Harnad, Shnider, Vinet [41].
In the other two cases, he was even able to prove again that quantization and
reduction do not commute. Here, the proofs are technically more involved than for
the homogeneous isotropic case. Besides, in all these cases, at least the invariant
homomorphisms along Lie curves (cf. (8)) have been derived by Hanusch. This
could make the deﬁnition of measures feasible not only on Ared as we showed here,
but also on Ared.
In general, conﬁguration spaces are only a small part of the problem. The next
one would be to study the full phase space. For loop quantum gravity, this lead to
the holonomy-ﬂux -algebra and the Weyl C-algebra whose representation theory
turned out to be fundamental. For homogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology,
the result by Ashtekar and Campiglia [4] has similar relevance. However, their proof
14This way, rotation in direction n with length t equals rotation in direction n with length t. The
homomorphy property of b together with Tn D T1

shows that Ab./ is well deﬁned.

relied on the Bojowald version of the conﬁguration space. It is now natural to ask
for an extension to the framework presented here. Indeed, one can expect to get
similar uniqueness as the R-invariance already singles out the same measure as in
[4], namely the Haar measure on RBohr. Having done this, one should enter the ﬁnal
stage of the Bojowald-Kastrup program: the construction of symmetric quantum
states.
But, even if we would be able to perform there well, there is still one conceptual
issue left open. Indeed, any measure, any phase space, any uniqueness result
above, rests upon one of the conﬁguration spaces of loop quantum cosmology. But,
typically, quantization and symmetry reduction do not commute. It is a completely
open ﬁeld to discuss all the questions above using the invariant conﬁguration space
of symmetric loop quantum gravity.

Abstract In cosmology the peculiar situation arises that all the parameters of a
standard cosmological model are precisely measured, whereas within the context of
this model 95 % of the cosmic matter and energy density are unknown quantities:
27 % are accounted for by nonbaryonic dark matter particles, and 68 % by a
mysterious something called dark energy. The astronomical observations leading to
this conclusion are presented in this article, the status of the experiments searching
for dark matter is reviewed, and some aspects of possible connections between dark
energy and fundamental theories are discussed.

Introduction and Outline
Over the past 15 years, the global properties of the universe have been well-
determined by astronomical observations. The term “universe” should just be
understood as the system of galaxies accessible to us. In that system, supernovae
of type Ia (SNe Ia) have been identiﬁed as reliable distance indicators, allowing to
measure the cosmic expansion to a precision of a few percent (cf. Sect. 2). Quite
surprisingly, a small deviation from the linear Hubble relation

where z is the redshift, d the distance, H0 the Hubble constant, and c the speed of
light, was detected, indicating that the expansion is accelerating. Detailed studies of
galaxies and clusters have revealed the existence of dark matter. These results are
in full agreement with the determination of cosmic parameters from the analysis of
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
It turns out that simple Friedmann-Lemaître (FL) cosmological models can
accommodate all the data. These models are derived from Einstein’s theory of
General Relativity (GR), and they describe the evolution of a homogeneous and
isotropic ﬂuid in a curved spacetime characterized by pressure p and density  which
are functions of time only (for the basic description of cosmology, I recommend
two textbooks [1, 2]). This can only be an approximation to the present state of the
universe, if the matter and radiation content is smoothed out over large scales, but it
seems to be adequate to derive global properties. Especially for early phases, when
density contrasts are small, the approximation becomes better.
The following rough picture emerges: the expansion time, the inverse of the
Hubble constant H0, is about 14 billion years. The total density is about equal to
the critical density, deﬁned as
c D 3H2

(2)
where G is the gravitational constant. Only a small fraction of the density of about
5 % is contributed by the baryonic matter, the “normal” matter consisting of protons,
neutrons, and electrons. About 27 % must be attributed to dark matter, clumps of
nonbaryonic particles. All this adds up to 32 %, leaving a deﬁcit in the balance
of 68 %, something which is distributed uniformly in space. Many call this “dark
energy”, not a very appropriate name, because we know since Einstein that matter
and energy are essentially the same. “Dark” matter and “dark” energy are, however,

very different: Whereas the mass in a comoving volume stays constant, the amount
of dark energy in a comoving volume increases with the volume. This stuff seems
to behave like a tension of empty space, relentlessly driving the expansion. “Dark
energy” is a name which hints at some mysterious substance, but pragmatically
speaking there is no mystery, it is just another parameter introduced so that the
model can ﬁt the data better (compare [14]).
Albert Einstein had introduced a “cosmological constant” to describe the world
model favored around 1915. Most astronomers at that time were convinced that
the world was nothing but a uniform, inﬁnite, unchanging assembly of stars. The
attractive force of gravity would pull all the stars together into one big clump, if it
were not balanced by a kind of repulsive gravity. A suitably chosen constant in the
equations can provide that balance (see Sect. 2). This approach fell into disrepute,
of course, once the expansion of the system of galaxies was discovered by Edwin
Hubble in the years after 1920. Moreover, this model is unstable against small
perturbations which drive it into expansion or collapse.
Now, astronomers have reinstalled the cosmological constant by recent very
precise measurements of the Hubble expansion. The data show that a cosmological
constant must account for about 68 % of the total energy content. This contribution
does not necessarily have to be just a constant. It might be a kind of potential energy
of a scalar ﬁeld which could perhaps change with time, although it looks like a cos-
mological constant now. There are as yet no convincing theoretical explanations for
the dark energy, but the attempts to understand it from a fundamental physics point
of view are vigorously pursued. Here seems to be an edge, where cosmology and
fundamental physical theories meet. The astronomical observations are supported
and conﬁrmed by the analysis of the anisotropies of the CMB. From the power
spectrum of the temperature ﬂuctuations in the CMB sky, all the cosmic parameters
can be determined (see Sect. 2). This is an independent piece of evidence, and the
fact that what is measured from the CMB agrees with the observations made from
stars and galaxies, indicates that the universe around us is well described by a simple
FL model with all its parameters precisely determined.
In what follows, I will ﬁrst (Sect. 2) discuss in some detail the astronomical
observations, and how they can all be nicely accommodated by a cosmological
model. This is the big success of modern cosmology. It works only, when dark
matter and dark energy are included in the picture. Therefore, I will describe in
Sects. 3 and 4 what we know of these two components of the cosmic substrate at
present. Possible connections to fundamental physics will be pointed out, and ﬁnally
the open questions remaining will be emphasized.

Measuring the Universe
The big telescopes have revealed a cosmos of galaxies of a great variety in shape
and luminosity (see Fig. 1, a famous sky map obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope).

Fig. 1 The Hubble Deep Field is one of mankind’s most distant optical views of the universe. The
dimmest galaxies in this picture are as faint as 30th magnitude. This 1 arcmin by 1 arcmin ﬁeld in
URSA Major contains about 2500 galaxies. The Hubble Space Telescope was pointed at this single
spot for 10 days (Courtesy of R. Williams, HDF team (Space Telescope Science Institute))
Two global properties of this system of galaxies are especially important: The
spectral lines of each of these galaxies are shifted toward the red, i.e. toward the
longer wavelengths. A few nearby galaxies, such as Andromeda, show a shift toward
the blue. But for the majority the “redshift” can serve as a measure for the distance,
as the American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble found in the 1920s. The further away
a galaxy is, the larger is its redshift. Hubble found that redshift z and distance d
are proportional to each other (cf. (1)). This rule holds for small values of z, i.e.
moderate distances. It can be interpreted as a Doppler effect: The galaxies move
away from us, and therefore the light emitted shows a Doppler-shift. Hubble’s
discovery changed the view of the cosmos dramatically. The idea of a static space
ﬁlled uniformly with stars had to be given up. It was replaced by the picture of an
expanding universe, where the galaxies move away from each other.
A second important point is just the fact that the velocity of light is ﬁnite. We
cannot see distant cosmic objects as they are now, because the light emitted by them
takes millions or billions of years to reach us. Astronomers see a kind of historical
cross section of the cosmos, where distant objects also are far back in the past. If
we follow the system of expanding galaxies back in time, we ﬁnd that 14 billion
years ago everything must have been very close together. The CMB, the cosmic
radiation ﬁeld, must have had a higher temperature at earlier epochs. This certainly
is true as long as quantum gravity effects are not important, i.e. at thermal energies

below the Planck energy of 1019 GeV. Thus, it seems to be a safe conclusion that
there must have been an extremely hot and dense early phase of the universe. All
the galaxies and stars which we observe now could not have existed in that hot
“big bang”. According to the known laws of physics, they were dissolved in a
structureless hot mixture of radiation and matter. The CMB gives us a record of
the very early time, when this cosmic primeval soup became transparent. These are
plausible considerations, and they can be made more quantitative in the framework
of a theoretical cosmological model.

Fig. 2 The qualitative time evolution of the expansion factor of FL cosmological models (here
plotted as “Relative size of the Universe” vs. Time) is shown in its dependence on the energy
density m and V, where the latter symbol corresponds to ƒ in the text. All models start from an
initial singularity, where the expansion factor is zero, and as a consequence density and curvature
become inﬁnite. This singular beginning marks the breakdown of the classical models. Probably
quantum gravity eventually will give an improved description of the models close to the singular
beginning. The model with m D 0:3, V D 0:7 is favored by observations. The orange graph is

GR describes the geometry and quantum ﬁeld theory gives the “vacuum energy”.
There are problems, however: “vacuum energies” derived from known ﬁeld theories
are too large, and lead to discrepancies with cosmological observations. Very likely a
quantum description of the geometry must be found in order to arrive at a consistent
picture. More about this in Sect. 4.
2.2
The Hubble Diagram of SNe Ia at High Redshifts
Naively, one plots a Hubble diagram as a graph where the velocities of galaxies are
plotted versus distance. For objects at cosmic distances, however, neither distance
nor velocity are directly measurable quantities. One commonly uses a formally
deﬁned luminosity distance DL
DL D
 L

(9)
where L is the intrinsic luminosity of the source and F is the observed ﬂux of energy.
It is convenient to set DL proportional to the “Hubble radius” c=H0, and deﬁne a
dimensionless quantity dL:
DL D c
H0
dL:
(10)
In all FL models, dL is a function of the redshift z and the important cosmic
parameters m and ƒ, where m includes all types of matter, also any kind of
dark matter. Plotting dL.zI m; ƒ/ versus z gives a Hubble diagram. Astronomers
commonly use logarithmic forms for L and F, so-called absolute and apparent

called distance modulus) such that

with
	 D M  5 log.H0  1 Mpc=c/ C 25
(Mpc D Megaparsec: 1 Mpc ' 3.28 million light years). Standard candles are
objects which ideally have constant absolute magnitude M, and thus 	 is a constant.
A relation between m and z determined from observations will give constraints on
m and ƒ. The main task is to ﬁnd suitable standard candles, and it has turned
out that SNe Ia are very promising candidates. The spectrum of these exploding
stars does not contain any hydrogen lines, only spectral lines of heavier elements
like helium, carbon, or oxygen. Very likely these are white dwarfs – compact
stars with the radius of the earth and the mass of the sun. The white dwarf star
probably is in orbit around a companion in a narrow binary system. Mass ﬂows
from the companion to the white dwarf, it grows in mass until it reaches the critical
Chandrasekhar mass, and becomes unstable. Then the gravitational collapse to a
neutron star occurs, or the degenerate carbon interior ignites, and a subsonic nuclear
burning front propagates outwards, and tears the white dwarf apart. In a few seconds
the stellar material is transformed into Ni56 and other elements between Si and
Fe. Ni56 decays into Co56 and later into Fe56. This radioactive decay produces the
luminosity of the supernova. SNe Ia are very bright and can be seen in far away
galaxies. They light up within a few hours or a few days, and then decay in the
course of several weeks.
Astronomers have found an empirical relation which allows them to determine
the maximum luminosity of a supernova from the shape of the lightcurve. A
slow decline of the lightcurve means that the peak luminosity is greater, while
a fast decline is usually connected with a smaller maximum. The quantitative
determination of this relation requires a calibration with supernovae whose distances
are known (e.g. from a Cepheid measurement), and many detections of supernovae
close to the maximum brightness. Over the years this has been achieved, such that
cosmic distances can be measured now with an accuracy of better than 10 %. There
remain, of course, systematic uncertainties which are difﬁcult to take into account,
especially the extinction of the radiation by intergalactic dust and evolutionary
effects on the appearance of SNe Ia such as changes in progenitor mass, in the
carbon to oxygen ratio over cosmic times. Theoretical models cannot yet predict
the outcome of SNe Ia explosions reliably since the complex physics of these
thermonuclear events requires multidimensional numerical simulations which must

include the treatment of strong turbulence. The studies accomplished so far show
that quite a variation in the amount of Ni56 is likely, and hence a range of peak
luminosities.
In view of these uncertainties, it is quite remarkable that the empirical relations
allow to push the intrinsic dispersion in peak luminosities below m D 0:17.
Figure 3 shows a Hubble diagram of 580 SNe [3], where the distance modulus 	
is plotted against the redshift z. The line drawn through the data points corresponds
to a cosmological model with total density tot. D 1, matter density m about 0.3,
and dark energy ƒ about 0.7. The Hubble constant is found as H0 D 70 in units of
kilometers per second per Megaparsec. In Fig. 4, we can see how the supernova data
can discriminate between different cosmological models [4]. The most surprising
result of these measurements is that the distant supernovae are actually more distant
than we would guess from Hubble’s law (1). They must have been accelerated
for some time in concordance with the acceleration (Ra > 0) caused by a positive
cosmological constant.
This observational fact has led many to consider seriously a mysterious “dark
energy” as the dominant component of the cosmic energy density, although it may
be nothing else than a cosmological constant. This spectacular result has been
conﬁrmed by the analysis of the anisotropies of the CMB. The cosmic microwave
radiation arrives almost isotropically in the wave length range between 0.5 mm and
10 cm, and its spectrum agrees perfectly with a theoretical Planck spectrum at a

temperature of 2.728 K (Fig. 5) [5]. From Eq. (6), one ﬁnds for the energy density
of a radiation ﬁeld a4 D const., and therefore the temperature T proportional to
a1. Thus, the temperature decreases in proportion to the growth of the expansion
factor, and at early times, it was correspondingly higher, eventually reaching thermal
energies of the order of the Planck energy of 1019 GeV close to the big bang. As
long as the temperature was above 3000 K, matter and radiation were in thermal
equilibrium. Below that temperature, atoms could form, the free electrons became
bound, and radiation and matter decoupled. This occurred at a redshift of about
1100, 380,000 years after the big bang.
An observer today detects the photons that had their last interaction with matter
at a redshift of z ' 1000, a look at the cosmos before stars and galaxies existed. The
CMB is almost smooth, but tiny variations in intensity across the sky of the order
of 105 can be detected. Figure 6 shows the pattern of the angular temperature
ﬂuctuations on the celestial sphere, obtained from measurements of the PLANCK
satellite. This ﬁgure is a snapshot of the distribution of radiation and energy at the
moment of recombination, giving us a picture of the universe when it was a thousand
times smaller and a hundred thousand times younger than today. In the PLANCK
sky map, the features subtending a given angle are associated with physics on a

spatial scale that can be computed from the angle and the angular diameter distance
to the last scattering surface. The latter depends on the cosmological model. The
physical processes responsible for the pattern are closely connected to the formation
of structures in the cosmos. Before recombination, small condensations in the dark
matter distribution existed already, and the plasma of photons and baryons followed
the gravitational pull of these condensations, but the radiation pressure of the
photons worked against this. Thus, the plasma clouds started to oscillate. The largest
cloud had been passed by such a pressure wave just once since recombination.
Larger clouds could not build up pressure, but just followed gravity, and contracted
slowly. Smaller clouds oscillated with a higher frequency. All oscillations were in
phase, perfectly synchronized by the big bang. During the contraction of the cloud,
the photon gas heated up, during expansion it cooled. At the recombination time,
the photons left the plasma clouds with slightly different temperatures, and show up
now as hot and cold spots on the CMB sky.
The statistical properties of these hot and cold regions of different angular size
can be determined from an autocorrelation function of the temperature differences
T across the sky. This shows a sequence of clearly deﬁned maxima (Fig. 7).
The data points are derived from a multipole expansion of .T/2 characterized
by an index `. Larger values of ` describe smaller angular scales. The angular
scale around ` ' 200 (corresponding to an angle of ' 1ı) is the location of a
prominent maximum. The physical scale corresponds roughly to the Hubble radius
at recombination which is the dividing line between the large-scale inhomogeneities
that have not changed much since their generation, and the small-scale perturbations
which have become smaller than the horizon before recombination and have been

substantially modiﬁed by the action of gravity. The power spectrum shown in Fig. 7
gives us direct information about the primordial spectrum of perturbations for `
less than 200, and for ` > 200 it enables us to derive all the parameters of the
cosmological model with high precision [6]. For a thorough description of how this
works, I recommend [2].
The latest results from the PLANCK satellite data tell us that the total density is
equal to the critical density
tot. D 1:
The matter component contributes 31.7 %, about 4.9 % are baryonic, 26.8 % are due
to dark matter, as yet unknown. There remains a deﬁcit of 68.3 % of some stuff
which does not cluster on the scale of superclusters of galaxies. This has been given
the name “dark energy”. It is the same quantity found from the accelerated Hubble
expansion, and it also agrees numerically. The accuracy of these measurements is a
few percent.

Dark Matter
3.1
Candidates
The CMB data indicate that the cosmic matter amounts to about 32 % of the critical
density, and that only 5 % of it is baryonic. This number is also obtained when one
considers the synthesis of the lightest elements deuterium, helium, and lithium in the
hot big bang, and compares theoretical results with astronomical measurements of
the abundances of these elements. The baryons observed in stars, or as a diffuse gas
producing X-rays, are only a fraction of this. So, even most of the baryonic matter is
dark (see, e.g. [1, 2]). Twenty-seven percent of the matter is dark and non-baryonic,
and as yet unknown. It is an experimental challenge to ﬁnd out the nature of these
particles. There are many particle physics candidates, and many experiments, but no
evidence as yet.
Some constraints can be derived for these candidates from the cosmological
model: They may have originated via decoupling from the thermodynamic equilib-
rium phase in the hot early universe, or they may have come from some nonthermal
process. Thermal relics may be relativistic or nonrelativistic at the moment of
decoupling. The relic particles which were relativistic at decoupling are called “hot
dark matter”, while “cold dark matter” is the name for the particles which were
nonrelativistic at the decoupling time. The neutrino and the neutralino are examples
of hot and cold relics, respectively.
In the beginning of dark matter research, a typical candidate for hot dark matter
were neutrinos. They are the only kind of nonbaryonic dark matter known to us.
It is known from the observation of solar neutrinos, and other experiments with
neutrino oscillations, that they have a nonzero mass. The mass difference between

246
G. Börner
the electron neutrino and the 	- or - neutrino is typically
0 < .m/2 	 104.eV/2:
If the neutrino masses are different, such that, e.g.
me < m	 < m;
then their masses are also proportional to
p
.m/2. Masses of the order of 102eV
may be a very realistic possibility. A degenerate mass spectrum, where the different
types of neutrinos have almost equal masses with small mass differences may still be
a possibility. Then the neutrino mass would be subject to an upper limit m 	 2:2eV
derived from ˇ-decay experiments.
However, neutrinos cannot be the right candidate for dark matter particles for
two reasons: They decouple when the temperature drops below 1 MeV, when only
electrons, positrons, and photons are still in thermal equilibrium. For each neutrino
species we have today

0 ' 0:5
 ' 0:13
in the case of mass degeneracy,
 ' 0:002
in the most likely case of m ' 102eV:
So, ﬁrstly, the neutrinos very likely do not contribute enough to the dark matter.
Secondly, they are streaming with relativistic velocities when they decouple, and
thus they damp out the inhomogeneities on scales smaller than the horizon scale
at decoupling. This is a large scale ' 13h2
0.1 C z/1 Mpc, larger than the size
of a galaxy cluster. As a result the large scale structure of the universe cannot
be explained, because this certainly requires ﬂuctuations on smaller scales. More
promising are models, where cold relics constitute the dominant part of the dark
matter. Cold relic particles decouple at temperatures corresponding to thermal
energies much less than their rest mass energy. Therefore their number density nx
is exponentially suppressed in comparison with n, the number density of photons.
To estimate nx at the time of decoupling, one equates their annihilation rate to the
Hubble expansion rate

Here, g.Tdec/ is a statistical factor; see, e.g. [2]. Weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs) which have masses between 10 GeV and a few TeV and cross sections
of approximately electroweak strength  ' 1038 cm2 are ideal candidates for
cold dark matter. Their number density freezes out at x  20, and they may
easily contribute the necessary 30 % to the total density of the universe. Several
experiments have been set up to search for WIMPs. In the next section, a status
report on these, up to now, unsuccessful searches is given.
3.2
Experimental Search for Dark Matter
The experiments to detect dark matter WIMPs directly via the interactions with
ordinary matter on Earth are usually placed underground to reduce signal back-
ground caused by high-energy cosmic rays. A very sensitive experiment of this
type is the Large Underground Xenon experiment (acronym LUX) at the Sanford
Underground Laboratory in the Homestake Mine in South Dakota. LUX consists
of an inner cryostat ﬁlled with 370 kg of liquid Xenon cooled to 100 ıC. 122
photomultiplier tubes detect light generated inside the detector. A cylindrical water
tank (8 m diameter, 6 m height) shields the detector from external radiation, such as
gamma rays and neutrons. The underground depth of 1500 m provides shielding
against cosmic rays. WIMPs interact exclusively with the liquid Xenon nuclei,
resulting in nuclear recoils. These interactions produce photons and electrons which
are registered. Neutron collisions with the Xe nuclei appear very similar. They must
be minimized through shielding and the use of appropriate building material. Since
WIMPs are so weakly interacting, most will pass through the detector unnoticed.
WIMPs which interact will have a negligible chance of interacting again. Neutrons,
on the other hand, have a reasonable large chance of multiple collisions within the
target volume. Thus, one compares single interactions to multiple interactions, and
once the ratio exceeds a certain value, the detection of dark matter is conﬁrmed.
In Fig. 8, the results of measurements done in 2013 are shown [7]. The result
is that so far there is no evidence for WIMP interactions. This is the most
sensitive result so far, and it rules out low-mass WIMP signal hints from previous
experiments. Below the blue line in Fig. 8 is the allowed range of cross section
and WIMP mass. The whole upper region, where previous tentative claims for
a detection are indicated, is excluded. Numerically the LUX experiment gives a
minimum upper limit for the cross section  	 7:6  1046 cm2 at a mass

WIMP-nucleon cross section (cm2)
Fig. 8 The ﬁgure shows the 90 % conﬁdence upper limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon
interaction cross section: LUX is compared to previous experiments. If WIMPs existed, as claimed
by these earlier experiments, LUX should have seen about 1500 of them (Source: The LUX
collaboration; [7]; http://www.lux.brown.edu)
(web-site: luxdarkmatter.org). The conclusion is clear: Up to now there is no
detection of a dark matter particle. An upgrade of LUX is under construction. The
experiments at the LHC in Geneva have detected the Higgs particle, but found no
hint for physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles. Thus, there
is also no indication which road should be followed when constructing theoretical
extensions of the standard model.
3.3
Alternative Theories of Gravity
Maybe there is no dark matter after all? Maybe we are missing the point in
postulating its existence, just as Ptolemy in ancient Egypt missed the point, when
he introduced more and more epicycles to ﬁt the motion of the celestial bodies to
circles? This is the motivation behind the attempts to change the laws of gravity such
that the observations can be explained without the need to introduce dark matter.
Modiﬁed Newtonian Dynamics (MOND; [8]) is the suggestion to set the
Newtonian gravitational force not just equal to mass times acceleration, but to write

That is, for accelerations a small compared to a constant a0, the force law is
modiﬁed. Proponents of MOND typically choose something like
	.x/ D .1 C x2/1=2:
Then, for an object in circular orbit around a central mass M, one ﬁnds for a small
acceleration GM=r2 D .1=a0/.v2=r/2, or
v4 D GMa0:
(14)
The velocity far away from the central mass is constant. More detailed ﬁts to galactic
rotation curves show that MOND can actually ﬁt the observed rotation curves very
well without the help of dark matter. The best ﬁts are achieved for a value of the
fundamental acceleration
a0 D 1:2  1010 ms2:
It is curious that MOND despite its ad hoc change of the dynamics can achieve
good agreement with observations on the galactic scale. Still, MOND is so far just
an alternative for Newtonian gravity. There is no underlying basic relativistic theory
of gravitation for it, although some extensions of GR have been constructed which
can lead to MOND type dynamics. These “Einstein-plus” theories consist of the
addition of basic vector and scalar ﬁelds, contain additional parameters, but still
cannot reproduce the full range of well-established results of GR (see, e.g. [10] for
a review). Therefore, the majority of cosmologists stick to GR and the standard
model of cosmology, and try to eventually solve the puzzles of dark matter and dark
energy within this framework.

Dark Energy
4.1
Dark Energy Models
The existence of a positive cosmological constant is experimentally well estab-
lished. From Fig. 9, we can clearly see how the combined evidence from CMB
and supernova observations singles out a small region in the m-ƒ plane. The
region can be narrowed down more by including the now available measurements
of baryonic acoustic oscillations, i.e. the signal recognizable in the clustering of
structure in the universe today caused by the oscillations within the baryon-photon
plasma before recombination. These measurements determine ƒ, the second free
constant in GR, and for the time being astronomers can be happy with that. No need
to talk about a mysterious “dark energy”. This pragmatic attitude is recommended,
e.g. in [14]. But many cosmologists are not content with that: It is true that one

can view ƒ just like Newton’s constant G as experimental input to the theory, but
it is curious that these two constants of nature are so different: G deﬁnes a huge
energy scale, the Planck scale of 1019 GeV D G1=2, while the energy density
ƒ=.8G/ D .1012 GeV/4 is tiny compared to particle physics energies. We can
phrase this in a different way: The cosmological constant deﬁnes a huge length
scale ƒ1=2 of about 1028 cm. Up to now nobody was able to bring this into contact
with microphysical units of length.
Whether or not quantum physical effects can lead to an understanding is an open
question at the moment. A deeper question is, why the typical ground state energy
densities of quantum theories do not contribute gravitationally. This is a problem of
quantum ﬁeld theory, separate from the measured result of a positive ƒ. Even for
ƒ D 0 this problem would be there [14]. In the following, I describe a few examples
to illustrate the research activity in this ﬁeld.
The ﬁrst example is the interpretation of ƒ as a dynamical quantity such as
the energy density of a slightly time-varying scalar ﬁeld. This case is referred to as

Cosmic Puzzles: Dark Matter and Dark Energy
251
“quintessence”. When we write the dark energy equation of state as
p D w;
then w D 1 corresponds to a cosmological constant or a vacuum energy density.
Any deviation of w from the value 1 points to a dynamical dark energy. It is a
challenge for the observers to narrow the uncertainties. Up to now w D 1 is
preferred. This would also have interesting consequences for the long-term future
of the universe. If dark energy is a cosmological constant, then the acceleration of
the expansion will continue forever, and the universe will become empty. If dark
energy is caused by a dynamical scalar ﬁeld, then this ﬁeld may decay, and ﬁll the
universe again with matter and energy. The “quintessence” model [9] makes use of
a scalar ﬁeld with a tailor-made potential. The basic idea is that the cosmological
constant is small because the universe is old. One considers a uniform scalar ﬁeld
with potential V./, and postulates a value 0 such that dV=d D 0 at 0. The
scalar ﬁeld  should approach this value, stay close to it, and change only slowly
with time. The densities of matter and energy are steadily decreasing as the cosmos
evolves, and eventually the potential energy dominates. Then the universe starts an
exponential expansion with the expansion factor a  exp.Ht/, and
H2.t/ ' 8G
3
V./:
(15)
The problem is, of course, why V./ should be small and of the order of the present
matter density at 0. It can be set up that way, if the potential is chosen appropriately.
One can construct “tracker” solutions, where the cross-over from an early matter
dominated expansion to a -ﬁeld dominated expansion can be arranged such that
the cross-over occurs just after recombination, and the desired properties arise. The
task remains to imbed such a scalar ﬁeld construction into a fundamental theory of
particle physics. Scalar ﬁelds with the desirable effective potential just may not exist
in such theories.
My second example is the model of inﬂationary cosmology [2]. The idea that a
short phase of rapid, exponential expansion, much faster than the a ' t1=2 law in
the radiation dominated phase of the standard model, occurs in the early universe,
has gained wide popularity. It seemingly explains various features of the standard
model in a natural way: the high entropy, the very nearly zero spatial curvature,
or equivalently the nearly critical energy density. The spectrum of initial density
ﬂuctuations can be calculated in inﬂationary models, and it agrees well with the
measurements from the CMB. These are strong points in favor of an early stage of
inﬂation. A scenario of this type almost appears to be necessary, because the horizon
structure of the standard FL models without inﬂation would not allow a physically
reasonable generation of density perturbations. It is an appealing scenario, but its
foundations in a fundamental theory are not laid out convincingly yet. Most models
employ a scalar ﬁeld  with potential energy V./. This looks very similar to the
quintessence models, but so far a relation between the two types of models has

252
G. Börner
not been established. How can the large potential energy of the inﬂation ﬁeld be
thermalized almost completely, except for a tiny remainder? This is difﬁcult to
achieve in a natural way.
A third example, completely within classical physics, is that the back reaction
of density inhomogeneities on the expansion may produce the measured effect of
an accelerated cosmic expansion [13]. Unfortunately the back-reaction term has not
been computed yet for a generic cosmological model, and one may suspect that it
turns out to be just a negligible correction. Density inhomogeneities on the scale of
galaxies and clusters are large, but the ﬂuctuations of the gravitational potential are
small, of order 0.01.
A fourth class of models for dark energy postulates deviations from GR. A
critical review of the rapidly growing literature in this case is [10]. Generally, the
alternative gravity models, such as the so-called f.R/ gravity (obtained by replacing
the Einstein action R  2ƒ by a function f.R/ of the Ricci scalar R) gain additional
freedoms by slight extensions of GR. Such additional terms to the Einstein action are
expected to arise from quantum gravity models. To explain dark energy, however,
these f.R/ models need extreme ﬁne tuning, and they all have severe problems of
their own in addition.
4.2
Vacuum Energy and Dark Energy
Quantum theory does not know empty space. The vacuum is a complex state with
ﬂuctuating quantum ﬁelds and condensates of various kinds. For a space-time metric
g	, we expect, because of Lorentz invariance, the vacuum expectation value of the
energy momentum tensor to read
< T	 >vac D g	vac C higher order curvature terms:
This would give rise to an effective cosmological constant ƒ D 8Gvac C ƒ0,
where ƒ0 is the bare cosmological constant in Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. Formally,
however, vac is inﬁnite, because it involves products of ﬁeld operators at the
same space-time point. Therefore, it has to be regularized and renormalized. In this
context the energy density of the vacuum is rather an input to the renormalization
than a prediction of the theory. It seems nevertheless reasonable to assume that the
regularization is provided by the short distance behavior of the products of ﬁeld
operators. Then a natural choice for the regularization is a cutoff at the energy scale,
where new physics is expected to appear. If one takes the Planck mass as the cutoff
scale, one ﬁnds a ratio of .1019 GeV/4 to .1012 GeV/4, i.e. a factor of 10123 over the
value of the measured dark energy. Similarly at the GUT scale a factor of 10108, and
at the electro-weak scale of 1 TeV a factor of 2  1059 between the vacuum energy
and the astronomical measurement of the cosmological constant. This is certainly
a fantastic failure of a theoretical prediction. This huge discrepancy means that the
vacuum energy densities must not be active gravitationally. An extremely precise

Cosmic Puzzles: Dark Matter and Dark Energy
253
cancellation between the bare ƒ0 and g	vac is required. At the moment there is
no good theoretical idea which tells us how to achieve this.
Clearly this problem would exist, even if the cosmological constant was zero. But
in some sense zero is not like any other number, because one might hope that some
symmetry principle could be found which would set the contribution of vacuum
energies exactly to zero and keep it at that value. A supersymmetric ﬁeld theory
may be a candidate, but such symmetries must be broken, since the real world is
not supersymmetric. The breaking scale must be at least about 1 TeV, and thus the
discrepancy remains huge. It seems difﬁcult to derive a small, but nonzero number
from a fundamental theory. Perhaps we have to wait for a theory of quantum gravity
to illuminate this question.
Superstring theory has had an interesting connection with the cosmological
constant [11]. First versions of superstring theory in ten dimensions gave rise
to a negative or zero cosmological constant, and for some time it seemed as if
the astronomical observations put the fundamental theory in trouble. Then it was
discovered in the attempts to solve the “moduli problem”, i.e. roughly speaking
the problem of how to make the higher extra dimensions stable, that the set of
6-dimensional Calabi-Yau spaces occurring in the compactiﬁcation of the theory
to a four-dimensional manifold had a much richer structure than anticipated. It
could be shown that in more complicated topologies the cosmological constant
could acquire a small positive value. This was a great relief, but there was also a
strange consequence to swallow: the number of independent classical background
conﬁgurations found in this approach increased tremendously. One estimates that
at least 10500 different solutions exist, each one giving rise to a different universe.
The hope that a unique theory of strings could be found, seems to fade away. Instead
a “landscape of superstring vacua”, and a “landscape of different universes” has
been proclaimed. In an act of desperation, so it seems, even famous physicists have
voiced the view that we live in a “multiverse”, and the properties of our universe can
only be understood by the appeal to an “anthropic principle” [12]. This expresses
the (trivial?) fact that we, perhaps generally intelligent life, can only exist in a world
with speciﬁc properties. This argument is merely a logical consistency which might
be regarded as a physical principle, if all these other worlds really existed. No
one knows, and no one even knows, whether our real world is among the 10500
conﬁgurations of string theory. Maybe they are all unstable, and then we would be
back at the pre-string theory status without a fundamental theory. Then it would not
be the “end of physics”, but a new beginning.
5
Outlook
It is fair to say that as of this time (mid-2015) there does not exist an explanation
of dark energy from a fundamental physics. A nasty-minded person might add that
many “models” are just a reformulation of the observational facts in the language of
ﬁeld theory. Seeing that there are many problems still unsolved should not give rise

254
G. Börner
to pessimism. Rather an optimistic outlook is appropriate: There is a lot to discuss,
and the chances are great that we will understand more and more things about our
world.
The most interesting aspect of the puzzles of dark matter and dark energy is in
my opinion that in both cases experiments and observations are in principle capable
of solving some of the problems: Within the next few years, one of the dark matter
searches will very likely come up with a positive result. The equation of state of
dark energy will be more precisely determined, and we will see whether a value of
w different from 1 is found.
Of course, many theoretical problems remain. The strange composition of the
cosmic substratum of 5 % baryonic matter, 27 % dark matter, and 68 % dark energy
must be explained by some fundamental theory. Why do these values add up to the
critical density? Why do we have dark matter and dark energy at all? Why do the
energy densities present in our modern quantum ﬁeld theories like QED or QCD
not have any gravitational effect? Maybe we will have to wait for an answer until a
uniﬁcation of GR and quantum theory has been found.
Another good problem for theorists is connected to the idea of cosmic inﬂation.
Why should the potential energy of the inﬂation ﬁeld have huge gravitational effects
in the early universe, leading to a rapid exponential expansion, while the vacuum
energies of quantum ﬁeld theories must not have any gravitational effect? An idea
which makes this distinction plausible is certainly very desirable.

Abstract The standard model of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics de-
scribes non-relativistic quantum matter, such as atoms and molecules, (minimally)
coupled to the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld. This model provides mathematically
solid and physically reasonable foundations for a description of all physical
processes arising from the interaction of matter and radiation. We review basic
notions, results and techniques in the theory of radiation and scattering, speciﬁcally,
Rayleigh scattering, within this model. We also describe some ideas entering the
proofs. This review is an extended version of the talk given at the Conference
“Quantum Mathematical Physics”, Regensburg, September/October, 2014.

Overview
The non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) was proposed in early days of
Quantum Mechanics. It was already taken for granted in 1932 when Fermi ([37])
wrote his review of theory of radiation. It was elaborated in an important way in
([69]) and its rigorous analysis was pioneered in [38, 39]. It describes quantum-
mechanical particle systems (minimally) coupled to the quantized electromagnetic
ﬁeld and arises from a standard quantization of a classical one (with possible
addition of internal – spin – degrees of freedom). In fact, it is the most general
quantum theory obtained as a quantization of a classical system. It gives a complete
and consistent account of electrons and nuclei interacting with electro-magnetic
radiation at low energies. It accounts for all physical phenomena in QED, apart
from vacuum polarization. In particular, it deals successfully with renormalization
of mass and energy and with the anomalous magnetic moment (see [7, 72, 79]). The
main issues a QED theory has to address are
•
Stability of elementary quantum systems such as atoms and molecules,
•
Radiation,
•
Scattering theory.
The headings above have the following translations into mathematical terms:
•
Stability ” Existence of the ground state,
•
Radiation ” Instability and decay of the excited states of particle systems,
•
Scattering ” Asymptotic behaviour of evolution at large times.

Radiation and Scattering in Non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics
259
Remarkable progress was made in the last 10 or so years in constructing
the rigorous theory of the stability, radiation and scattering. Three powerful and
unifying techniques emerged as the result of this development: theory of resonances,
giving a clear-cut mathematical description of processes of emission and absorption
of the electro-magnetic radiation, the spectral renormalization group, giving the
perturbation theory for bound states and resonances and the method of propagation
observables and propagation inequalities underpinning the scattering theory.
In this brief review, we summarize progress on the ﬁrst two items and give more
details on the last one. In considering the long-time dynamics, we concentrate on
energies below the ionization threshold (Rayleigh scattering). The review is based
on the papers [35, 36]. We also borrow some general material from our previous
review [73], to which we refer the reader for more details and references of the
problems of stability and radiation (see also the review [4] and the book [79]).
We formulate the key problems related the long-time dynamics which is the area
of concentration of this review. The Hamiltonian H of a non-relativistic particle
system coupled to the quantized electromagnetic or phonon ﬁeld is self-adjoint and
generates the dynamics through the Schrödinger equation,
i@t t D H t:
(1)
As initial conditions,  0, we consider states below the ionization threshold †, i.e.  0
in the range of the spectral projection E.1;†/.H/. In other words, we are interested
in processes, like emission and absorption of radiation, or scattering of photons on
a particle system (say, an atom or a molecule or an electron bound by an external
potential) in which the particle system is not being ionized.
Denote by ˆj and Ej the eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian H, below †, i.e. Ej < †. The following are the key characteristics of
the evolution of (1), in progressive order the depth of information they provide:
•
Local decay stating that photons are either bound to the particle system or escape
to inﬁnity, i.e. the probability that they occupy any bounded region of the physical
space tends to zero, as t ! 1.
•
Minimal photon velocity bound with speed c stating that, as t ! 1, with the
probability ! 1, the distance of the departing photons to the particle system
 c0t, for any c0 < c.
Similarly, if the probability that at least one photon is at the distance  c00t,
c00 > c, from the particle system vanishes, as t ! 1, we say that the evolution
satisﬁes the maximal photon velocity bound with speed c.
•
Asymptotic completeness on the interval .1; †/ stating that, for any  0 2
Ran E.1;†/.H/; and any  > 0, there are photon wave functions fj 2 F, with
a ﬁnite number of photons, s.t. the solution,  t D eitH 0, of the Schrödinger

(One can verify that ˆj˝sfj is well-deﬁned, at least for the ground state ( j D 0).)
In other words, for any  > 0 and with probability  1  , the Schrödinger
evolution  t approaches asymptotically a superposition of states in which the
particle system with a photon cloud bound to it is in one of its bound states ˆj,
with additional photons (or possibly none) escaping to inﬁnity with the velocity
of light.
We give the rigorous deﬁnitions of the local decay, the photon velocity and
asymptotic completeness in Appendix Appendix 5: and Sects. 4 and 5, respectively.
The reason for  > 0 in (2) is that for the state ˆj ˝s fj to be well deﬁned, as one
would expect, one would have to have a very tight control on the number of photons
in fj, i.e. the number of photons escaping the particle system. (See the remark at the
end of Subsection 5.4 of [35] for a more technical explanation.) For massive bosons
 > 0 can be dropped (set to zero), as the number of photons can be bound by the
energy cut-off.
The results and techniques discussed in this review are also applicable to the
phonon Hamiltonians. The latter are discussed in Appendix Appendix 2:.
In order to make the review more accessible to non-experts, we included

Ultra-Violet Cut-Off
We reintroduce the Planck constant, „, speed of light, c, and electron mass, mel, for
a moment. Assuming the ultra-violet cut-off 
.k/ decays on the scale k0, in order
to correctly describe the phenomena of interest, such as emission and absorption of
electromagnetic radiation, i.e. for optical and rf modes, we have to assume that the
cut-off energy,
„ck0  ˛2melc2; ionization energy, characteristic energy of the particle motion:
On the other hand, we should exclude the energies where the relativistic effects,
such as electron-positron pair creation, vacuum polarization and relativistic recoil,
take place, and therefore we assume
„ck0 
 melc2; the rest energy of the the electron:
Combining the last two conditions we arrive at ˛2melc=„ 
 k0 
 melc=„, or in our
units,
˛2mel

 mel :
The Hamiltonian (3) is obtained by the rescaling x ! ˛1x and k ! ˛2k of the
original QED Hamiltonian (see Appendix Appendix 1:). After this rescaling, the
new cut-off momentum scale, k0

proving the results discussed below, one ﬁrst proves them for the generalized Pauli-

Stability and Radiation
We assume for simplicity that our matter consists of electrons and the nuclei
and that the nuclei are inﬁnitely heavy and therefore are manifested through
the interactions only (put differently, the molecules are treated in the Born –
Oppenheimer approximation). In this case, the coupling constants j are equal,
j D , related to the electron charge e as  WD ˛3=2, where ˛ D

the ﬁne-structure constant, and mj D m. It is shown (see Sect. 7 and a review in [4]
for references and discussion) that the physical electron mass, mel, is not the same
as the parameter m  mj (the ‘bare’ electron mass) entering (3), but depends on m
and . Inverting this relation, we can think of m as a function of mel and . If we
ﬁx the particle potential U.x/ (e.g. taking it to be the total Coulomb potential), and
mel and e, then the Hamiltonian (3) depends on one free parameter, the bare electron
mass m (or the ultraviolet cut-off scale, ).
3.1
Results
We begin with considering the matter system alone. As was mentioned above, its
state space, Hp, is either L2.R3n/ or a subspace of this space determined by a
symmetry group of the particle system, and its Hamiltonian operator, Hp, acting
on Hp, is given by

where xj is the Laplacian in the variable xj and, recall, U.x/ is the total potential
of the particle system. Under the conditions on the potentials U.x/, given above,
the operator Hp is self-adjoint and bounded below. Typically, according to the HVZ
theorem, its spectrum consists of isolated eigenvalues, .p/

and continuum Œ†.p/; 1/, starting at the ionization threshold †.p/, as shown in the

The eigenfunctions corresponding to the isolated eigenvalues are exponentially
localized. Thus left on its own the particle system, either in its ground state or in
one of the excited states, is stable and well localized in space. We expect that this
picture changes dramatically when the total system (the universe) also includes the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, which at this level must be considered to be quantum. As was
already indicated above what we expect is the following
•
The stability of the system under consideration is equivalent to the statement of
existence of the ground state of H, i.e. an eigenfunction with the smallest possible
energy.
•
The physical phenomenon of radiation is expressed mathematically as emergence
of resonances out of excited states of a particle system due to coupling of this
system to the quantum electro-magnetic ﬁeld.
As a result, we would like to show that
(1) The ground state of the particle system is stable when the coupling is turned
on, while
(2) The excited states, generically, are not. They turn into resonances.
3.2
Infrared Problem
The resonances arise from the eigenvalues of the non-interacting Hamiltonian HD0.
The latter is of the form
H0 D Hpart ˝ 1f C 1part ˝ Hf :
(14)
The low energy spectrum of the operator H0 consists of branches Œ.p/
i ; 1/ of ab-
solutely continuous spectrum and of the eigenvalues .p/
i ’s, sitting at the continuous
spectrum ‘thresholds’ .p/
i ’s. Here, recall, .p/
0
< .p/
1
< : : : < †.p/ are the isolated
eigenvalues of the particle Hamiltonian Hp. Let .p/
i
be the eigenfunctions of the
particle system, while  be the photon vacuum. The eigenvalues .p/
i ’s correspond to
the eigenfunctions .p/
i
˝  of H0. The branches Œ.p/
i ; 1/ of absolutely continuous
spectrum are associated with generalized eigenfunctionsof the form .p/
i ˝g, where
g are the generalized eigenfunctions of Hf W Hf g D g; 0 <  < 1.
The absence of gaps between the eigenvalues and thresholds is a consequence
of the fact that the photons are massless. To address this problem we use the
spectral renormalization group (RG). The problem here is that the leading part of
the perturbation in H is marginal.

Approach
The main steps in our analysis of the spectral structure of the quantum Hamiltonian
H are:
•
Perform a new canonical transformation (a generalized Pauli-Fierz transform, see
Sect. 2.2 above)
H ! QH WD eiˆ.qx/Heiˆ.qx/;
in order to bring H to a more convenient form for our analysis;

Radiation and Scattering in Non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics
267
•
Apply the spectral renormalization group (RG) on new – momentum
anisotropic – Banach spaces.
The main ideas of the spectral RG are as follows:
•
Pass from a single operator
QH to a Banach space B of Hamiltonian-type
operators;
•
Construct a map, R, (RG transformation) on B, with the following properties:
(a) R is ‘isospectral’;
(b) R removes the photon degrees of freedom related to energies  .
•
Relate the dynamics of semi-ﬂow, Rn
; n  1, (called renormalization group) to
spectral properties of individual operators in B.

Minimal Velocity
Results We deﬁne the photon velocity in terms of its space-time (and sometimes
phase-space-time) localization. In a quantum theory this is formulated in terms of
quantum localization observables and related to quantum probabilities. We describe
the photon position by the operator y WD irk on L2.R3/, canonically conjugate to
the photon momentum k. To test the photon localization, we use the observables
d.1S.y//, where 1S.y/ denotes the characteristic function of a subset S of R3 and
d./ denotes the lifting of a one-photon operator  to the photon Fock space,

268
I.M. Sigal
The observables d.1S.y// can be interpreted as giving the number of photons in
Borel sets S  R3. They are closely related to those used in [41, 48, 63] (and
discussed earlier in [65] and [1]) and are consistent with a theoretical description
of the detection of photons (usually via the photoelectric effect, see e.g. [66]). The
quantity h ; .1S.y// i is interpreted as the probability that the photons are in
the set S in the state  . This said, we should mention that the subject of photon
localization is still far from being settled. (The issue of localizability of photons is a
tricky one and has been intensely discussed in the literature since the 1930 and 1932
papers by Landau and Peierls [62] and Pauli [68] (see also a review in [60]). A set
of axioms for localization observables was proposed by Newton and Wigner [67]
and Wightman [80] and further generalized by Jauch and Piron [59]. Observables
describing localization of massless particles, satisfying the Jauch-Piron version of
the Wightman axioms, were constructed by Amrein in [1].)
The fact that for photons the observables we use depend on the choice of polariza-
tion vector ﬁelds, ".k/,  D 1; 2; which are not smooth, is not an impediment here
as our results imply analogous results for e.g. localization observables of Mandel
[65] and of Amrein and Jauch and Piron [1, 59]: d. f man

of h D L2.R3I C2/. Here P? W f.k/ ! f.k/  jkj2k k  f.k/ is the orthogonal
projection on the transverse vector ﬁelds and, for two orthogonal projections P1 and
P2, the symbol P1 \ P2 stand for the orthogonal projection on the largest subspace
contained in RanP1 and RanP2. (The polarization vector ﬁelds ".k/ can be avoided
by using the approach of [64].)
In what follows, 	1 denotes a smoothed out characteristic function of the
interval .1; 1, that is it is in C1.R/, non-increasing, equal to 1 if x 	 1=2 and
equal to 0 if x  1. Moreover, 

As we discussed above, the operator H has a unique ground state (denoted here
as ˆgs) and that generically (e.g. under the Fermi Golden Rule condition), H has no
eigenvalues in the interval .Egs; a, where a < † can be taken arbitrarily close to
†, depending on the coupling constant and on whether the particle system has an
inﬁnite number of eigenvalues accumulating to its ionization threshold (see [9, 44,
47]). We assume that this is exactly the case:
Fermi’s Golden Rule ([7, 8]) holds for all excited eigenvalues 	 a of Hp.
(19)
Assumption (19) means that for every excited eigenvalue ej 	 a of Hp, we have
…jWIm..H0  ej  i0C/1 N…j/W…j  cj…j;
cj > 0;
(20)
where H0 WD Hp C Hf (for either model), W WD H  H0, …j denotes the projection
onto the eigenspace of H0 associated to ej and N…j WD 1  …j. In fact, there is
an explicit representation of (20). Since it differs slightly for different models, we
present it for the phonon one, assuming for simplicity that the eigenvalue ej is
simple:
Z
hj; g.k/Im.Hp C !.k/  ej  i0C/1g.k/jidk > 0;
(21)
where j is an eigenfunction of Hp corresponding to the eigenvalue ej and the inner
product is in the space Hp. It is clear from (21) that Fermi’s Golden Rule holds
generally, with a very few exceptions.
Let N WD d.1/ be the photon (or phonon) number operator and N WD d.!/

respectively.
(2) The estimate (26) states that, as t ! 1, with probability ! 1, either all photons
are attached to the particle system in the combined ground state, or at least one
photon departs the particle system with the distance growing at least as O.t˛/.

(Remember that the set ‡# excludes the ground state, and the exited states below
† are excluded by the condition (19).)
(3) With some more work, one can remove the assumption (19) and relax the
condition on  0 in Theorem 4.2 to the natural one:  0 2 P†D.d.hyi//,
where P† is the spectral projection onto the orthogonal complement of the

exposition and a more recent review) and extended to the non-relativistic quantum
electrodynamics in [26, 40–43, 48] and to the P.'/2 quantum ﬁeld theory, in [27].

Now, it is known (see [8, 51]) that the operator H has a unique ground state
(denoted here as ˆgs). Let Egs be the ground state energy and Egs < a < † be
such that the Hamiltonian H has no eigenvalues in the interval .Egs; a. We say that
asymptotic completeness holds on the interval  D ŒEgs; a, if, for every  > 0 and

Generically (e.g. under the Fermi Golden Rule condition, (19)), H has no
eigenvalues in the interval .Egs; a, where a < † can be taken arbitrarily close
to †, depending on the coupling constant and on whether the particle system has
an inﬁnite number of eigenvalues accumulating to its ionization threshold (see
[9, 44, 47]). We assume that this is exactly the case. Assumption (19) was stated
rigorously in (20) and discussed after that formula. As was mentioned above,
Fermi’s Golden Rule holds generally, with a very few exceptions. Treatment of

the (exceptional) situation when excited embedded eigenvalues do occur requires,
within our approach, proving a delicate estimate kP f.H/k . hgi, where P

Assumption (33) can be replaced by the slightly weaker hypothesis that there

The advantage of Assumption (34) is that the uniform bound on
N1 D d.!1/
is required to hold only for an arbitrary dense set of initial states and, as a result,
can be veriﬁed for the massless spin-boson model by modifying slightly the proof of
[20] (see the discussion below). Hence asymptotic completeness in this case holds
with no implicit conditions.
As we see from the results above, the uniform bounds, (33) or (34), on the
number of photons (or phonons) emerge as the remaining stumbling blocks to
proving asymptotic completeness without qualiﬁcations. The difﬁculty in proving
these bounds for massless ﬁelds is due to the same infrared problem which pervades
this ﬁeld and which was successfully tackled in other central issues, such as the
theory of ground states and resonances (see [4, 73] for reviews), the local decay and
the maximal velocity bound.
For massive bosons (e.g. optical phonons), the inequality (33) (as well as (22),
with 0 D 0) is easily proven and the proof below simpliﬁes considerably as well.

I.M. Sigal
In this case, the result is unconditional. It was ﬁrst proven in [26] for models with
conﬁned particles, and in [41] for Rayleigh scattering.
As was mentioned above, for the spin-boson model, a uniform bound
h t; eıN ti 	 C. 0/ < 1; ı > 0
on the number of photons, on a dense set of  0’s, was recently proven in the
remarkable paper [20].
To verify (34) for the spin-boson model, with 	 > 0, we proceed precisely in
the same way as in [20], but using a stronger condition on the decay of correlation
functions,

(35)
for some ˛  1, instead of Assumption A of [20], and bounding the observable
.1CN1=2/2 instead of eN. Assumption C of [20] on initial states has to be replaced
in the same manner. Assuming that our condition (34) on the coupling function g is
satisﬁed with 	 > 0 (and  D 1), we see that (35) holds with ˛ D 1 C 2	.
The form of the observable eN enters [20] through the estimate kKu;vk˘ 	
Cjh.u  v/j of the operator Ku;v deﬁned in [20, (3.4)] and the standard estimate
[20, (4.36)]. Both extend readily to our case (the former with h.t/ given in (35)).
Moreover, [20, (4.36)] is used in the proof that pressure vanishes – Eq. (4.39) in
[20] – and the latter also follows from Proposition A.1 of [35]. (One can also use
the observable ed. ln !/ – equal to .!/, see (16) below for the deﬁnition of
./ – and analyticity, rather than perturbation, in .)
Approach Once the minimal velocity estimates are proven, the ﬁrst step in the
proof of asymptotic completeness is to decouple the photons in the expanding ball
fb 	 ct˛g from those inside fb  ct˛g. To this end we use the second quantization,
.j/ W .h/ ! ˛.h ˚ h/ of a partition of unity j W h ! j0h ˚ j1h on the one-photon
space, j W h ! h ˚ h, with j0 localizing a photon to a region fb 	 ct˛g, and j1, to
fb  ct˛g, and satisfying j2

.j/.j/ D 1.
The partition .j/ is further reﬁned as ([26, 41]) L.j/ WD U.j/ W .h/ !
.h/ ˝ .h/, where U W .h ˚ h/ ! .h/ ˝ .h/ is the unitary map deﬁned
through the relations U D ˝, Ua.h/ D Œa.h1/˝1C1˝a.h2/U; for any
h D .h1; h2/ 2 h ˚ h, and is then lifted from the Fock space F D .h/ to the full
state space H D Hp ˝ F. As above, L.j/ L.j/ D 1. (We call L.j/ the Derezi´nski-
Gérard partition of unity .) Using L.j/, we deﬁne the Deift-Simon wave operators
([22, 26, 41, 74]),

reduce the problem to the estimate of the same integral as the one appearing in the
ﬁrst minimal velocity estimate for b. Then the latter estimate implies that the limits
in (42) exist.
The existence of the Deift-Simon wave operators implies that

Conclusion
Apart from the vacuum polarization, the non-relativistic QED provides a good
qualitative description of the physical phenomena related to the interaction of
quantized electrons and nuclei and the electro-magnetic ﬁeld.
The quantitative results though are still missing. Does the free parameter, m
(or ), sufﬁce to give a good ﬁt with the experimental data, say, on the radiative
corrections? Another important open question is the behaviour of the theory in the
ultra-violet cut-off.

Comments on Literature
The local decay property was proven in [8–10, 13, 44–47], by the combination of the
renormalization group and positive commutator methods. The maximal and minimal
velocity estimates were proven in [11] and [36], respectively. For models involving
massive bosons ﬁelds, some minimal velocity estimates are proven in [26].
In [20], the authors proved relaxation to the ground state and uniform bounds
on the number of emitted massless bosons in the spin-boson model. (Importance of
both questions was emphasized earlier by Jürg Fröhlich.)
Asymptotic completeness was proven for (a small perturbation of) a solvable
model involving a harmonic oscillator (see [2, 78]), and for models involving
massive boson ﬁelds ([26, 41–43]). Moreover, [48] obtained some important results
for massless bosons (the Nelson model) in conﬁned potentials.
Motivated by the many-body quantum scattering, [26, 41–43, 48] deﬁned the
main notions of scattering theory on Fock spaces, such as wave operators, asymp-
totic completeness and propagation estimates.
In [35], asymptotic completeness was proven for Rayleigh scattering on the states
for which the expectation of either the photon/phonon number operator, N, or an
operator, N1, testing the photon/phonon infrared behaviour is uniformly bounded on
corresponding dense sets. By extending the result of [20] in a straightforward way,
[35] have shown that the second of these conditions is satisﬁed for the spin-boson
model. For comparison of this ﬁrst result with [48], see [35].

Appendix 1:

0.y/ is the original

we arrive at the Hamiltonian (3), where   j WD ˛3=2 and A.y/ D A
.˛y/, with

.k/ WD 
0.˛2k/. After that we relax the restriction on U.x/ by allowing it to be
a standard generalized n-body potential (see Sect. 2). Note that though this is not
displayed, A.x/ does depend on . This however does not effect the analysis of the
Hamiltonian H. (If anything, this makes certain parts of it simpler, as derivatives of
A.x/ bring down .)
In order not to deal with the problem of center-of-mass motion which is not
essential in the present context, we assume that either some of the particles (nuclei)
are inﬁnitely heavy (a molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation), or the
system is placed in a binding, external potential ﬁeld. (In the case of the Born-
Oppenheimer molecule, the resulting V.x/ also depends on the rescaled coordinates
of the nuclei, but this does not effect our analysis except of making the complex
deformation of the particle system more complicated (see [57]).) This means that
the operator Hp has isolated eigenvalues below its essential spectrum. The general
case is considered below.

consider below only the most difﬁcult case !.k/ D jkj.
The operator I.g/ acts on H and represents an interaction energy, labeled by a
coupling family g.k/ of operators acting on the particle space Hp. In the simplest

potential and that 	  1=2. This can be easily upgraded to an Nbody system
(e.g. an atom or a molecule, see e.g. [53, 73]).

phonon models), (51) holds with 1 D hpi1 and 2 D hxi1.

Appendix 3:
Translationally Invariant Hamiltonians
If we do not assume that the nuclei are inﬁnitely and there are no external forces
acting on the system, then the Hamiltonian (3) is translationally symmetric. This
leads to conservation of the total momentum (a quantum version of the classical
Noether theorem). Indeed, the system of particles interacting with the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁelds is invariant under translations of the particle coordinates,
x ! x C y, where y D .y; : : : ; y/ (n tuple) and the ﬁelds, A.x/ ! A.x  y/,
i.e. H commutes with the translations Ty W ‰.x/ ! eiyPf‰.x C y/, where Pf is the

It is straightforward to show that Ty are unitary operators and that they satisfy the
relations TxCy D TxTy; and therefore y ! Ty is a unitary Abelian representation
of R3. Finally, we observe that the group Ty is generated by the total momentum
operator, Ptot, of the electrons and the photon ﬁeld: Ty D eiyPtot. Here Ptot is the
selfadjoint operator on H, given by
Ptot WD

formalize in what follows. Let  t D eitH 0, where H is a Hamiltonian of the
form (48)–(49), with the coupling operator g.k/ satisfying
(50) and (51). The
method reduces propagation estimates for our system say of the form

showing that t is a one-photon weak or strong propagation observable, i.e. to one-

Recall that the propagation speed of the light and the Planck constant divided by 2
are set equal to 1 and that the one-particle space is h WD L2.R3I C/, for phonons, and
h WD L2.R3I C2/, for photons. In both cases we use the momentum representation
and write functions from this space as u.k/ and u.k; /, respectively, where k 2 R3
is the wave vector or momentum of the photon and  2 f1; C1g is its polarization.
The Bosonic Fock space, F, over h is deﬁned by

where Sn is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace of totally symmetric n-
particle wave functions contained in the n-fold tensor product h˝n of h; and

The vector  WD .1; 0; : : :/ is called the vacuum vector in F. Vectors ‰ 2 F
can be identiﬁed with sequences . n/1
nD0 of n-particle wave functions, which
are totally symmetric in their n arguments, and  0 2 C. In the ﬁrst case these
functions are of the form,  n.k1; : : : ; kn/, while in the second case, of the form
 n.k1; 1; : : : ; kn; n/, where j 2 f1; 1g are the polarization variables.
In what follows we present some key deﬁnitions in the ﬁrst case, limiting
ourselves to remarks at the end of this appendix on how these deﬁnitions have to
be modiﬁed for the second case. The scalar product of two vectors ‰ and ˆ is given

Given an operator  acting on the one-particle space h, the operator d./ (the

More generally, for any operator, t, on the one-particle space L2.R3; C; d3k/ we

tization of t). The precise meaning of the latter expression can obtained by using a

Abstract We describe here a novel way of deﬁning Hamiltonians for quantum ﬁeld
theories (QFTs), based on the particle–position representation of the state vector
and involving a condition on the state vector that we call an “interior–boundary
condition.” At least for some QFTs (and, we hope, for many), this approach leads to
a well-deﬁned, self-adjoint Hamiltonian without the need for an ultraviolet cut-off
or renormalization.

Introduction
In quantum ﬁeld theories (QFTs), the terms in the Hamiltonian governing particle
creation and annihilation are usually ultraviolet (UV) divergent. The problem can
be circumvented by a UV cut-off, that is, by either discretizing space or attributing a
nonzero radius to the electron (or other particles). Another, novel approach [10, 19]
is outlined here, leading to Hamiltonians that are well deﬁned, involve particle
creation and annihilation, treat space as a continuum, and give radius zero to
electrons. They are deﬁned in the particle-position representation of Fock space
by means of a new kind of boundary condition on the wave function, which we call
an interior-boundary condition (IBC) because it relates values of the wave function
on a boundary of conﬁguration space to values in the interior. Here, the relevant
conﬁguration space is that of a variable number of particles, the relevant boundary
consists of the collision conﬁgurations (i.e., those at which two or more particles
meet), and the relevant interior point lies in a sector with fewer particles.
An IBC is a rather simple condition and provides, as we explain below, a
mathematically natural way of implementing particle creation and annihilation at a
source of radius zero. It is associated with a Hamiltonian HIBC deﬁned on a domain
consisting of functions that satisfy the IBC. For several models that our collaborators
Jonas Lampart, Julian Schmidt, and we have studied, we have been able to prove
the self-adjointness of HIBC; these results ensure that HIBC is free of divergence
problems, UV or otherwise. For suitable choice of the IBC, the Hamiltonian also
seems physically plausible, for several reasons that we will describe in more detail
in Sect. 4: (i) HIBC has relevant similarities to the original, UV divergent expression
for H that one would guess from physical principles; these similarities make HIBC
seem like a natural interpretation of that expression. (ii) HIBC has properties and
consequences that seem physically reasonable. (iii) In certain models it is possible,
after starting from the original expression for H and introducing a UV cut-off,
to obtain a well-deﬁned limiting Hamiltonian H1 by taking a suitable limit of

Avoiding Ultraviolet Divergence by Means of Interior–Boundary Conditions
295
removing the cut-off; H1 is called a renormalized Hamiltonian (see, e.g., [6]). We
have found in such cases that HIBC agrees with H1 up to addition of a ﬁnite constant;
this result supports that HIBC is physically reasonable and, conversely, provides an
explicit description of H1 that was not available so far.
In this paper, we focus on non-relativistic Hamiltonians; there is work in progress
[12] about similar constructions with the Dirac operator. Further work on IBCs is
forthcoming in [7, 9, 11]. A future goal is to formulate quantum electrodynamics
(QED) in terms of IBCs, building particularly on the work of Landau and Peierls
[13] about QED in the particle-position representation.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we give a gentle introduction to
the idea of an interior–boundary condition by means of a toy quantum theory. In
Sect. 3, we describe a similar IBC and Hamiltonian involving particle creation and
annihilation. In Sect. 4, we describe how this can be applied to QFTs by means of the
particle-position representation, and report some results on the rigorous existence of
self-adjoint Hamiltonians deﬁned by means of IBCs.
2
Simple Example of an Interior–Boundary Condition
To introduce the concept of an IBC, we start with a toy example, for which we will
set up a “conﬁguration space” Q, a Hilbert space H D L2.Q/, and a Hamiltonian
H on H.
2.1
Conﬁguration Space and Hilbert Space
Consider, as the conﬁguration space Q, the (disjoint) union of Q.1/ D R and Q.2/ D
˚
.x; y/ 2 R2 W y  0

; see Fig. 1.
Fig. 1 The conﬁguration
space of the toy example
consists of two disconnected
parts of different dimensions,
a line (bottom) and a half
plane (top)

296
S. Teufel and R. Tumulka
We refer to Q.1/ and Q.2/ as the two sectors of Q. Wave functions are complex-
valued functions on Q; any such function can be speciﬁed by specifying  .1/ and
 .2/, the restrictions of  to Q.1/ and Q.2/ (called the sectors of  ). To obtain a
Hilbert space H, we regard Q as a measure space with measure 	 deﬁned in the
obvious way by
	.S/ D .1/
S \ Q.1/
C .2/
S \ Q.2/
(1)
for measurable sets S  Q with .n/ the Lebesgue measure (n-dimensional volume)
in Rn, and take H D L2.Q; 	/. That is, the inner product is given by
h ji D

Q.1/
dx  .1/.x/ .1/.x/ C
Z
Q.2/

(2)
Equivalently,
H D H .1/ ˚ H .2/
(3)
with
H.n/ D L2Q.n/; .n/ :
(4)
The conﬁguration space Q has a boundary
@Q D
˚
.x; y/ 2 R2 W y D 0

:
(5)
That is, Q.2/ has a boundary, while the boundary of Q.1/ is empty. We call any
non-boundary point an interior point.
2.2
Interior–Boundary Condition and Hamiltonian
We now impose a boundary condition on  . Usual boundary conditions are
conditions on the value or a derivative of  at a boundary point. However, our
boundary condition, which we call an interior–boundary condition (IBC), relates
the value (or a derivative) of  at a boundary point to the value of  at an interior
point; in this case, the boundary point .x; 0/ 2 @Q.2/ gets compared to the point
x 2 Q.1/, which is an interior point in a different sector. The IBC reads:
 .2/.x; 0/ D  2mg
„2  .1/.x/
(6)
for every x 2 R. Here, m > 0 is a mass parameter and g > 0 a coupling
constant. Note that the IBC is a linear condition. We elucidate below how one can

Avoiding Ultraviolet Divergence by Means of Interior–Boundary Conditions
297
arrive at considering this condition. The IBC (6) goes together with the following
Hamiltonian H:
.H /.1/.x/ D  „2

x .1/.x/ C g @y .2/.x; 0/
(7a)
.H /.2/.x; y/ D  „2

@2
x C @2
y

 .2/.x; y/
for y > 0 :
(7b)
It consists of the free Schrödinger operators and a further term that links  .1/ to  .2/.
Note that H acts linearly on  D . .1/;  .2//. In order to understand the effect of
the additional term, and why (7) can be expected to deﬁne a unitary time evolution,
we need to consider the balance equation for the probability current.
2.3
Probability Current and Probability Balance
The well-known probability current vector ﬁeld associated with the free Schrödinger
Hamiltonian .„2=2m/r2 on Rn has the form
j D „
m Im

 r 

(8)
and satisﬁes a continuity equation with the probability density  D j j2,
@t D r  j :
(9)
Generally, it follows from the Schrödinger equation i„@t D H that
@j .q/j2
@t

„ Im
h
 .q/.H /.q/
i
(10)
at any conﬁguration q, and for H D .„2=2m/r2 the right-hand side becomes that
of (9).
When considering a conﬁguration space with boundary as in our example, the
possibility arises of a probability current into the boundary, which can mean a loss
of overall probability and thus a breakdown of unitarity. This can be avoided by
boundary conditions such as a Dirichlet condition
 .2/.x; 0/ D 0
(11)
or a Neumann condition
@y .2/.x; 0/ D 0 :
(12)

298
S. Teufel and R. Tumulka
Either of these conditions forces the current j to have vanishing normal component
at every boundary point, leading to zero current into the boundary. The IBC setup,
in contrast, allows nonvanishing current into the boundary while compensating this
loss by a gain in probability on a different sector. In fact, the balance equation for
the probability density in the ﬁrst sector reads

(13e)
where we have used ﬁrst (10) in (13a), then (7a) in (13b), then (6) in (13c), and
then (8) in (13e), writing j.2/
y
for the y-component of the 2-vector j.2/. The last
Eq. (13e) means that on Q.1/, j j2 changes due to two factors: transport along Q.1/
as governed by j.1/, plus a second term signifying gain or loss in probability that
compensates exactly the loss or gain in Q.2/ due to current into the boundary, since
the usual continuity Eq.(9) holds in the interior of Q.2/. In this way, the overall
probability p.1/.t/ C p.2/.t/, with

(14)
is conserved, while probability may well be exchanged between Q.1/ and Q.2/, so
that p.1/.t/ and p.2/.t/ are not individually conserved.
Readers may ﬁnd it useful to visualize the probability ﬂow in terms of Bohmian
trajectories [7]. The Bohmian conﬁguration corresponds to a random point Qt in
conﬁguration space that moves in a way designed to ensure that Qt has probability
distribution j .t/j2 for every t. In our example, this distribution entails, when  .1/
and  .2/ are both non-zero, that Qt lies in Q.1/ with probability p.1/.t/ and in Q.2/
with probability p.2/.t/. If in Q.2/, Qt moves according to Bohm’s law of motion
dQt
dt D j.2/.Qt; t/
.2/.Qt; t/
(15)

Avoiding Ultraviolet Divergence by Means of Interior–Boundary Conditions
299
until Qt hits the boundary at .X; 0/, at which moment the conﬁguration jumps1
to X 2 Q.1/. Once in Q.1/, the conﬁguration moves according to Bohm’s law of
motion, i.e.,
dQt
dt D j.1/.Qt; t/
.1/.Qt; t/ ;
(16)
and during any time interval of inﬁnitesimal length dt, Qt D Xt has probability
.Xt; t/ dt D maxf0; j.2/.Xt; 0; t/g
.1/.Xt; t/
dt ;
(17)
to jump to the point .Xt; 0/ on the boundary of Q.2/ and continue from there into
the interior of Q.2/ according to (15). From these laws it follows that if Qt is j .t/j2
distributed for t D 0, then Qt is j .t/j2 distributed also for t > 0 [7].
On another matter, it may seem from the deﬁning Eqs. (7) of H that H cannot be
Hermitian because there is no Hermitian conjugate to the term g @y .2/.x; 0/ in (7a).
However, the conservation of probability just discussed implies that there is no need
for such a term; rather, the IBC replaces it.
Let us return once more to the calculation (13) to understand how one arrives at
the Hamiltonian (7) and the IBC (6). Suppose we want (13e) to hold, i.e., we want
an additional term in the balance equation for .1/ that compensates the loss or gain
of probability in Q.2/ due to current into the boundary. Then we have to have, in the
expression for .H /.1/, an additional term T2 beyond  „2
2m@2
x .1/.x/, and in order to
go from (13a) to (13d) we need that
2
„ Im
h
 .1/.x/ T2
i
D  „
m Im
h
 .2/.x; 0/ @y .2/.x; 0/
i
:
(18)
This situation suggests that T2 should involve  .2/. Since T2 needs to be linear in
 , we need another ingredient that will allow us to replace the  .1/.x/ on the left-
hand side by a term involving  .2/, thus leading to an IBC. One possibility is that
 .2/.x; 0/ on the right-hand side is proportional to  .1/.x/ by virtue of the IBC,
and that the term @y .2/.x; 0/ comes from T2, and that leads to the equations we
gave above, with an arbitrary choice of the coupling constant g. (In fact, we may
allow g to be negative or even complex if we replace g by g in (6). However, this
does not really lead to more possibilities, as the resulting time evolution is unitarily
1An alternative way of looking at the situation, without jumps, arises from identifying Q.1/ with
the boundary of Q.2/; this is described under the name “radical topology” of Q in [7]. Such an
identiﬁcation must be used with care, for example because the measure on Q is still given by (1)
whereas boundaries usually have measure zero, and because the Laplacian on Q.1/ does not have a
@2
y term. If we make this identiﬁcation, which goes particularly naturally together with the IBC (6)
if 2mg=„2 D 1, then the Bohmian conﬁguration does not jump, but simply moves along the
boundary @Q.2/ D Q.1/ after reaching it.

equivalent to the one with real coupling constant jgj. That is because if  satisﬁes (6)
with g ! g and (7) then Q with Q .2/ D
g
jgj .2/, Q .1/ D  .1/ satisﬁes (6) and (7)
with g ! jgj.)
2.4
Neumann vs. Dirichlet Conditions
Another possibility for fulﬁlling (18) becomes obvious when re-writing
Im
h
 .2/.x; y/ @y .2/.x; y/
i
as
 Im
h
@y .2/.x; y/  .2/.x; y/

;
(19)
viz., that @y .2/.x; 0/ is proportional to  .1/.x/, thus leading to a different IBC,
while T2 is proportional to  .2/.x; 0/. This leads to the equations
@y .2/.x; 0/ D C 2mg

That is, while the original IBC (21a) was of Dirichlet type (in that it speciﬁes the
value of  .2/ on the boundary), the alternative IBC (20a) is of Neumann type (in
that it speciﬁes the normal derivative of  .2/ on the boundary). This change is
accompanied by a change of the term T2 in the equation for the Hamiltonian and
leads to a different time evolution.

Rigorous, Self-Adjoint Hamiltonian
Readers that are mathematicians may be interested in the rigorous deﬁnition of the
Hamiltonian, which we give here for the Dirichlet-type condition (6). The domain
D consists of functions in H that satisfy the IBC. More precisely, let
D0 D H2.R/ ˚ H2R  Œ0; 1/  H .1/ ˚ H .2/ ;
(26)
where H2 denotes the second Sobolev space, and H2
R  Œ0; 1/

contains the
restriction of functions in H2.R2/ to R  Œ0; 1/. By the Sobolev embedding
theorem (e.g., [1, p. 85]), any element  .2/ of H2.R2/ possesses a unique restriction
f 2 L2.R/ to the subspace R  f0g. The IBC (6), understood as the condition
f D .2mg=„2/ .1/, is thus meaningful for every  2 D0, and we can deﬁne
D D
n
 2 D0 W f D  2mg
„2  .1/o
:
(27)
Likewise, the y-derivative of any element of H2.R2/ lies in H1.R2/ and possesses,
by the Sobolev embedding theorem, a unique restriction h 2 L2.R/ to the subspace
R  f0g. Thus, the Hamiltonian can be deﬁned on D by

Particle Creation via IBC
We now transfer the IBC approach to a simple model of particle creation and
annihilation.
3.1
Conﬁguration Space and Hilbert Space
Suppose that x-particles can emit and absorb y-particles, and consider a single x-
particle ﬁxed at the origin. For simplicity, we take the x- and y-particles to be
spinless, and we intend to cut off from the Fock space for the y-particles any sector
with particle number 2 or higher. To this end, we consider only y-conﬁgurations
with 0 or 1 particle, so Q D Q.0/ [ Q.1/, where Q.0/ has a single element (the
empty conﬁguration ;), while Q.1/ is a copy of physical space R3. Wave functions
are again functions  W Q ! C, and the Hilbert space is
H D H .0/ ˚ H .1/ D C ˚ L2.R3/ ;

IBC and Hamiltonian
The relevant boundary of Q.1/ is the set @Q.1/ D fr D 0g, which corresponds to
the origin (the location of the x-particle) in R3 and is represented by the surface
f0gS2 in spherical coordinates. Probability current into this boundary corresponds
to the annihilation of the y-particle and current out of the boundary to the creation
of a y-particle. (In terms of Bohmian trajectories, when a trajectory Qt in Q.1/ hits
fr D 0g, so that the y-particle reaches the origin, then Qt jumps to ; 2 Q.0/, so
that the y-particles gets absorbed by the x-particle; conversely, if Qt D ;, then at a
random time, governed by a law similar to (17), Qt jumps to fr D 0g and moves
into the interior, fr > 0g, so that a y-particle gets emitted by the x-particle.)
In this setup, the IBC analogous to (6) reads: For every ! 2 S2,

It can be shown [10] that (36) deﬁnes a self-adjoint operator H on a dense domain
D in H consisting of functions satisfying the IBC (35). (It turns out that elements
of D satisfy a stronger version of (35) that has the limit r ! 0 replaced by the limit
r! ! 0; that is, the stronger version does not demand that the limit be taken in
the radial direction, keeping ! constant, but allows any way of approaching the
boundary surface, even without a limiting value for !.)
3.3
Remarks
1. 1=r asymptotics. As a consequence of the IBC (35), whenever  .0/ is nonzero
then  .1/ diverges at fr D 0g like 1=r. This behavior is to be expected, for a
reason that is perhaps most easily appreciated by means of the following simple
approximation: Consider an ensemble of systems in which the y-particle moves
at unit speed towards the origin and gets annihilated when it reaches the origin;
that is, the motion follows the equation of motion
dy
dt D  y
jyj :
(37)

304
S. Teufel and R. Tumulka
Suppose ﬁrst that the ensemble density is uniform over a spherical shell of
radius r and thickness dr; as the members of the ensemble move inwards, the
density increases like 1=r2 since the area of a sphere is proportional to r2 and the
thickness dr remains constant. As a consequence, the stationary density for the
particle motion (37) diverges at the origin like 1=r2. It thus comes as no surprise
that j j2 on Q.1/ should diverge at the origin like 1=r2, and so j j should diverge
like 1=r. Conversely, the 1=r divergence of  .1/ at the boundary fr D 0g makes
the r factor in the IBC (35) necessary, as limr&0  .1/.r!/ (without the r factor)
does not exist.
2. HIBC is not a perturbation of Hfree. We note that HIBC cannot be decomposed
into a sum of two self-adjoint operators Hfree C Hinteraction. As a consequence,
HIBC cannot be found when studying Hamiltonians of the form Hfree CHinteraction.
That is because the domain DIBC of HIBC is different from the free domain Dfree;
speciﬁcally, functions in DIBC diverge like 1=r at fr D 0g, while functions in the
free domain (the second Sobolev space) stay bounded at fr D 0g and thus yield
limr&0

r .1/.r!/

D 0. The Laplacian is not self-adjoint on DIBC (i.e., does
not conserve probability) because it allows a nonzero ﬂux of probability into the
boundary fr D 0g, while the additional term in HIBC compensates that ﬂux by
adding it to Q.0/.
3. Comparison to a known boundary condition. Boundary conditions at fr D 0g
have been used before; in particular, Bethe and Peierls [3] introduced the
boundary condition

IBC in QFT
The application of interior–boundary conditions in quantum ﬁeld theory is based
on the particle-position representation, in which a QFT becomes a kind of quantum
mechanics with particle creation and annihilation.
In relativistic QFT, there are issues with the particle-position representation, but
they do not seem fatal for the IBC approach: (i) Some QFTs appear to lead to an
inﬁnite number of particles (e.g., [5]); a conﬁguration space for an inﬁnite number
of particles will be more difﬁcult, but not impossible, to deal with. (ii) Photons are
believed not to have a good position representation (e.g., [4]). However, photon
wave functions are believed to be mathematically equivalent to (complexiﬁed)
classical Maxwell ﬁelds [4], and that may be good enough for IBCs. (iii) The
construction of the conﬁguration space is based on a choice of hypersurface in
space-time M; however, the use of multi-time wave functions [16] would avoid such
a choice, as such wave functions are deﬁned on (the spacelike subset of) [1
nD0Mn.
We focus here on non-relativistic models, for which the relevant Hilbert spaces
are bosonic or fermionic Fock spaces F˙, or tensor products of such spaces.
The corresponding conﬁguration space contains conﬁgurations of any number of
particles (see Fig. 2),

Model QFT
Suppose again that x-particles can emit and absorb y-particles. In [11] we study a
model QFT adapted from [17, p. 339], [15], and the Lee model [14], starting out
from the following, UV divergent expression for the Hamiltonian:

g > 0 a coupling constant, and E0  0 the amount of energy required to create a
y-particle. The Hilbert space is

We consider here a simpliﬁed version of this model, in which we allow only a

is ﬁxed at the origin 0 2 R3; such models are sometimes connected with the name of
van Hove [6, 21]. The Hilbert space of this model is H D FC

IBC Approach
What the IBC approach yields for this model is just the extension of the equations of
Sect. 3 to an unbounded number of y-particles. The relevant boundary of Q consists
of those conﬁgurations yn for which a y-particle collides with the x-particle, i.e.,
yj D 0 for some j 	 n; the related interior conﬁguration is obtained by removing yj
(and all other y-particles at 0, if any). The Dirichlet-type IBC reads as follows: For

Theorem 2 ([10]) On a certain dense subspace DIBC of H, the elements of which
satisfy the IBC (52), the operator HIBC given by (53) is well-deﬁned and self-adjoint.
It may seem that HIBC as in (53) should have the same UV problem as Horig
in (50); after all, we said that the problem with Horig is caused by the Dirac ı
function, and the last line of (53) coincides with that of (50), and in particular

Avoiding Ultraviolet Divergence by Means of Interior–Boundary Conditions
309
contains the same ı function. And yet, HIBC is well deﬁned and Horig is not! Here
is why. As in the model of Sect. 3 (see Remark 1),  grows like 1=r D 1=jyjj as
yj ! 0 due to the IBC (52), and as readers may recall from classical electrostatics,
where 1=r comes up as the Coulomb potential, the Laplacian of 1=r (which equals
the charge density, according to the Poisson equation of electrostatics) is 4ı3.x/.
As a consequence, the Laplacian in the ﬁrst row of (53) contributes a ı function,
which then gets exactly canceled by the ı function in the last row of (53). That is
how HIBC can manage to be a square-integrable function on Q.
The fact that the last line of (53) coincides with that of (50), that is, that both
equations have the same term for particle creation, underlines the parallel between
HIBC and Horig and suggests that HIBC may be regarded as a precise interpretation of
the formal expression (50) for Horig.
At this point, readers may wonder why the formula (36b) for the Hamiltonian
in the simpler creation model did not contain a ı function. The reason is merely a
matter of notation, as (36) can be equivalently rewritten as
.H /.0/ D

(54b)
In (36b), we explicitly assumed r > 0, thus stating the action of H only away from
the origin, so that the term involving ı3.y/ does not show up. In (53) and (54b), in
contrast, we did not exclude the origin because we wanted to make the ı behavior
explicit.

Remarks
4. Positive Hamiltonian. For E0 > 0, it can be shown [10] that HIBC as in (53) is a
positive operator.

As a consequence, for any two locations x1 and x2, the ground state energy of
the y-particles, given the x-particles at x1 and x2, is given by (58) with R D
jx1 x2j. Regarding this energy function of x1 and x2 as an effective potential for
the x-particles (which is appropriate when the x-particles move slowly, see, e.g.,
[18]), we see that x-particles effectively interact through an attractive Yukawa
potential, V.R/ D const.  e˛R=R.
7. Comparison to renormalization procedure. Returning to the scenario with a
single x-particle ﬁxed at the origin, consider Hcutoff D H' as in (51) with cut-
off function ' and take the limit ' ! ı3. It is known [6] that, if E0 > 0, there
exist constants E' ! 1 and a self-adjoint operator H1 such that

Abstract The theory of causal fermion systems is an approach to describe fun-
damental physics. We here introduce the mathematical framework and give an
overview of the objectives and current results.
Keywords Relativistic quantum theory • Uniﬁed theories

Causal fermion systems were introduced in [17] as a reformulation and generaliza-
tion of the setting used in the fermionic projector approach [8]. The theory of causal
fermion systems is an approach to describe fundamental physics. It gives quantum
mechanics, general relativity and quantum ﬁeld theory as limiting cases and is
therefore a candidate for a uniﬁed physical theory. In this article, we introduce the
mathematical framework and give an overview of the different limiting cases. The
presentation is self-contained and includes references to the corresponding research
papers. The aim is not only to convey the underlying physical picture, but also to
lay the mathematical foundations in a conceptually convincing way. This includes
technical issues like specifying the topologies on the different spaces of functions
and operators, giving a mathematical deﬁnition of an ultraviolet regularization,
or specifying the maps which identify the objects of the causal fermion system
with corresponding objects in Minkowski space. Also, we use a basis-independent
notation whenever possible. The reader interested in a non-technical introduction is
referred to [21].

The Abstract Framework
1.1
Basic Deﬁnitions
For conceptual clarity, we begin with the general deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 1.1 (causal fermion system) Given a separable complex Hilbert
space H with scalar product h:j:iH and a parameter n 2 N (the “spin dimension”),
we let F  L.H/ be the set of all self-adjoint operators on H of ﬁnite rank, which
(counting multiplicities) have at most n positive and at most n negative eigenvalues.
On F we are given a positive measure  (deﬁned on a -algebra of subsets of F),
the so-called universal measure. We refer to .H; F; / as a causal fermion system.
We remark that the separability of the Hilbert space (i.e. the assumption that H
admits an at most countable Hilbert space basis) is not essential and could be left
out. We included the separability assumption because it seems to cover all cases of
physical interest and is useful if one wants to work with basis representations.
A causal fermion system describes a space-time together with all structures
and objects therein (like the causal and metric structures, spinors and interacting

quantum ﬁelds). In order to single out the physically admissible causal fermion
systems, one must formulate physical equations. This is accomplished with the help
of an action principle which we now introduce. For any x; y 2 F, the product xy
is an operator of rank at most 2n. We denote its non-trivial eigenvalues (counting
algebraic multiplicities) by xy
1 ; : : : ; xy
2n 2 C. We introduce the spectral weight j : j
of an operator as the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. In particular, the
spectral weight of the operator products xy and .xy/2 is deﬁned by

where C is a given parameter (and tr denotes the trace of a linear operator on H).
In order to make the causal action principle mathematically well-deﬁned, one
needs to specify the class of measures in which to vary . To this end, on F we
consider the topology induced by the operator norm
kAk WD sup
˚
kAukH with kukH D 1

:
(6)
In this topology, the Lagrangian as well as the integrands in (4) and (5) are
continuous. The -algebra generated by the open sets of F consists of the so-called
Borel sets. A regular Borel measure is a measure on the Borel sets with the property
that it is continuous under approximations by compact sets from inside and by open
sets from outside (for basics see for example [30, §52]). The right prescription is
to vary  within the class of regular Borel measures of F. In the so-called ﬁnite-
dimensional setting when H is ﬁnite-dimensional and the total volume .F/ is ﬁnite,
the existence of minimizers is proven in [9, 10], and the properties of minimizing
measures are analyzed in [1, 26].

The causal action principle also makes mathematical sense in the so-called
inﬁnite-dimensional setting when H is inﬁnite-dimensional and the total vol-
ume .F/ is inﬁnite. In this case, the volume constraint (3) is implemented by
demanding that all variations ..//2.";"/ should for all ; 0 2 ."; "/ satisfy

(where j:j denotes the total variation of a measure; see [30, §28]). The existence
theory in the inﬁnite-dimensional setting has not yet been developed. But it is known
that the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to the causal action principle still
have a mathematical meaning (as will be explained in Sect. 4.1 below). This makes it
possible to analyze the causal action principle without restrictions on the dimension
of H nor on the total volume. One way of getting along without an existence
theory in the inﬁnite-dimensional setting is to take the point of view that on a
fundamental physical level, the Hilbert space H is ﬁnite-dimensional, whereas the
inﬁnite-dimensional setting merely is a mathematical idealization needed in order
to describe systems involving an inﬁnite number of quantum particles.
We ﬁnally explain the signiﬁcance of the constraints. Generally speaking, the
constraints (3), (4), and (5) are needed to avoid trivial minimizers and in order
for the variational principle to be well-posed. More speciﬁcally, if we dropped the
constraint of ﬁxed total volume (3), the measure  D 0 would be trivial minimizer.
Without the boundedness constraint (5), the loss of compactness discussed in [10,
Section 2.2] implies that no minimizers exist. If, on the other hand, we dropped the
trace constraint (4), a trivial minimizer could be constructed as follows. We let x be
the operator with the matrix representation

and choose  as a multiple of the Dirac measure supported at x. Then T

Space-Time and Causal Structure
A causal fermion system .H; F; / encodes a large amount of information. In order
to recover this information, one can for example form products of linear operators
in F, compute the eigenvalues of such operator products and integrate expressions
involving these eigenvalues with respect to the universal measure. However, it is not
obvious what all this information means. In order to clarify the situation, we now
introduce additional mathematical objects. These objects are inherent in the sense
that we only use information already encoded in the causal fermion system.

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
317
We ﬁrst deﬁne space-time, denoted by M, as the support of the universal measure,
M WD supp   F :
On M we consider the topology induced by F (generated by the sup-norm (6)
on L.H/). Moreover, the universal measure jM restricted to M can be regarded as a
volume measure on space-time. This makes space-time into a topological measure
space. Furthermore, one has the following notion of causality:
Deﬁnition 1.2 (causal structure) For any x; y 2 F, the product xy is an operator
of rank at most 2n. We denote its non-trivial eigenvalues (counting algebraic
multiplicities) by xy
1 ; : : : ; xy
2n. The points x and y are called spacelike separated
if all the xy
j have the same absolute value. They are said to be timelike separated if
the xy
j are all real and do not all have the same absolute value. In all other cases (i.e.
if the xy
j are not all real and do not all have the same absolute value), the points x
and y are said to be lightlike separated.
Restricting the causal structure of F to M, we get causal relations in space-time. To
avoid confusion, we remark that in earlier papers (see [14, 17]) a slightly different
deﬁnition of the causal structure was used. But the modiﬁed deﬁnition used here
seems preferable.
The Lagrangian (1) is compatible with the above notion of causality in the
following sense. Suppose that two points x; y 2 F are spacelike separated. Then
the eigenvalues xy
i all have the same absolute value. Rewriting (1) as

one concludes that the Lagrangian vanishes. Thus pairs of points with spacelike
separation do not enter the action. This can be seen in analogy to the usual notion of
causality where points with spacelike separation cannot inﬂuence each other.1 This
analogy is the reason for the notion “causal” in “causal fermion system” and “causal
action principle.”
The above notion of causality is symmetric in x and y, as we now explain. Since
the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, we know that

(8)
(where tr again denotes the trace of a linear operator on H). Since all our operators
have ﬁnite rank, there is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace I of H such that xy maps I

entanglement between regions with space-like separation. This will become clear in Sects. 1.4
and 5.3.

to itself and vanishes on the orthogonal complement of I. Then the non-trivial
eigenvalues of the operator product xy are given as the zeros of the characteristic
polynomial of the restriction xyjI W I ! I. The coefﬁcients of this characteristic
polynomial (like the trace, the determinant, etc.) are symmetric polynomials in the
eigenvalues and can therefore be expressed in terms of traces of powers of xy. As
a consequence, the identity (8) implies that the operators xy and yx have the same
characteristic polynomial and are thus isospectral. This shows that the causal notions
are indeed symmetric in the sense that x and y are spacelike separated if and only
if y and x are (and similarly for timelike and lightlike separation). One also sees that
the Lagrangian L.x; y/ is symmetric in its two arguments.
A causal fermion system also distinguishes a direction of time. To this end, we
let x be the orthogonal projection in H on the subspace x.H/  H and introduce
the functional
C W M  M ! R ;
C.x; y/ WD i Tr

y x y x  x y x y

(9)
(this functional was ﬁrst stated in [18, Section 7.5], motivated by constructions
in [14, Section 3.5]). Obviously, this functional is anti-symmetric in its two
arguments. This makes it possible to introduce the notions
(
y lies in the future of x
if C.x; y/ > 0
y lies in the past of x
if C.x; y/ < 0 :
(10)
By distinguishing a direction of time, we get a structure similar to a causal set (see
for example [3]). But in contrast to a causal set, our notion of “lies in the future
of” is not necessarily transitive. This corresponds to our physical conception that
the transitivity of the causal relations could be violated both on the cosmological
scale (there might be closed timelike curves) and on the microscopic scale (there
seems no compelling reason why the causal relations should be transitive down to
the Planck scale). This is the reason why we consider other structures (namely the
universal measure and the causal action principle) as being more fundamental. In
our setting, causality merely is a derived structure encoded in the causal fermion
system.
1.3
The Kernel of the Fermionic Projector
The causal action principle depends crucially on the eigenvalues of the operator
product xy with x; y 2 F. For computing these eigenvalues, it is convenient not
to consider this operator product on the (possibly inﬁnite-dimensional) Hilbert
space H, but instead to restrict attention to a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of H,
chosen such that the operator product vanishes on the orthogonal complement of
this subspace. This construction leads us to the spin spaces and to the kernel of
the fermionic projector, which we now introduce. For every x 2 F we deﬁne the

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
319
spin space Sx by Sx D x.H/; it is a subspace of H of dimension at most 2n. For
any x; y 2 M we deﬁne the kernel of the fermionic operator P.x; y/ by
P.x; y/ D x yjSy W Sy ! Sx
(11)
(where x is again the orthogonal projection on the subspace x.H/  H). Taking
the trace of (11) in the case x D y, one ﬁnds that
tr.x/ D TrSx.P.x; x// ;
making it possible to express the integrand of the trace constraint (4) in terms of
the kernel of the fermionic operator. In order to also express the eigenvalues of the
operator xy, we deﬁne the closed chain Axy as the product
Axy D P.x; y/ P.y; x/ W Sx ! Sx :
(12)
Computing powers of the closed chain, one obtains
Axy D .xy/.yx/jSx D x yxjSx ;
.Axy/p D x .yx/pjSx :
Taking the trace, one sees in particular that TrSx.Ap
xy/ D tr .yx/p. Repeating the
arguments after (8), one concludes that the eigenvalues of the closed chain coincide
with the non-trivial eigenvalues xy
1 ; : : : ; xy
2n of the operator xy in Deﬁnition 1.2.
Therefore, the kernel of the fermionic operator encodes the causal structure of M.
The main advantage of working with the kernel of the fermionic operator is that the
closed chain (12) is a linear operator on a vector space of dimension at most 2n,
making it possible to compute the xy
1 ; : : : ; xy
2n as the eigenvalues of a ﬁnite matrix.
Next, it is very convenient to arrange that the kernel of the fermionic operator is
symmetric in the sense that
P.x; y/ D P.y; x/ :
(13)
To this end, one chooses on the spin space Sx the spin scalar product :j:x by
ujvx D hujxuiH
(for all u; v 2 Sx) :
(14)
Due to the factor x on the right, this deﬁnition really makes the kernel of the
fermionic operator symmetric, as is veriﬁed by the computation
u j P.x; y/ vx D hu j x P.x; y/ viH D hu j xy viH
D hy x u j y viH D P.y; x/ u j vy

320
F. Finster
(where u 2 Sx and v 2 Sy). The spin space .Sx; :j:x/ is an indeﬁnite inner product
of signature . p; q/ with p; q 	 n. In this way, indeﬁnite inner product spaces arise
naturally when analyzing the mathematical structure of the causal action principle.
The kernel of the fermionic operator as deﬁned by (11) is also referred to as the
kernel of the fermionic projector, provided that suitable normalization conditions
are satisﬁed. Different normalization conditions have been proposed and analyzed
(see the discussion in [28, Section 2.2]). More recently, it was observed in [20]
that one of these normalization conditions is automatically satisﬁed if the universal
measure is a minimizer of the causal action principle (see Sect. 4.2 below). With this
in mind, we no longer need to be so careful about the normalization. For notational
simplicity, we always refer to P.x; y/ as the kernel of the fermionic projector.
1.4
Wave Functions and Spinors
For clarity, we sometimes denote the spin space Sx at a space-time point x 2 M
by SxM. A wave function  is deﬁned as a function which to every x 2 M associates
a vector of the corresponding spin space,
 W M ! H
with
 .x/ 2 SxM
for all x 2 M :
(15)
We now want to deﬁne what we mean by continuity of a wave function. For the
notion of continuity, we need to compare the wave function at different space-time
points, being vectors  .x/ 2 SxM and  .y/ 2 SyM in different spin spaces. Using
that both spin spaces SxM and SyM are subspaces of the same Hilbert space H,
an obvious idea is to simply work with the Hilbert space norm k .x/   .y/kH.
However, in view of the factor x in the spin scalar product (14), it is preferable to
insert a corresponding power of the operator x. Namely, the natural norm on the spin
space .Sx; :j:x/ is given by

(where jxj is the absolute value of the symmetric operator x on H, and
p

square root thereof). This leads us to deﬁning that the wave function  is continuous

Likewise,  is said to be continuous on M if it continuous at every x 2 M. We
denote the set of continuous wave functions by C0.M; SM/. Clearly, the space of
continuous wave functions is a complex vector space with pointwise operations, i.e.
.˛ C ˇ/.x/ WD ˛ .x/ C ˇ.x/ with ˛; ˇ 2 C.

It is an important observation that every vector u 2 H of the Hilbert space gives
rise to a unique wave function. To obtain this wave function, denoted by  u, we
simply project the vector u to the corresponding spin spaces,
 u W M ! H ;
 u.x/ D xu 2 SxM :
(16)
We refer to  u as the physical wave function of u 2 H. The estimate2

shows that  u is indeed continuous. The physical picture is that the physical wave
functions  u are those wave functions which are realized in the physical system.
Using a common physical notion, one could say that the vectors in H correspond to
the “occupied states” of the system, and that an occupied state u 2 H is represented
in space-time by the corresponding physical wave function  u. The shortcoming
of this notion is that an “occupied state” is deﬁned only for free quantum ﬁelds,
whereas the physical wave functions are deﬁned also in the interacting theory. For
this reason, we prefer not use the notion of “occupied states.”
For a convenient notation, we also introduce the wave evaluation operator ‰
as an operator which to every Hilbert space vector associates the corresponding

The structure of the wave functions (15) taking values in the spin spaces is
reminiscent of sections of a vector bundle. The only difference is that our setting
is more general in that the base space M does not need to be a manifold, and
the ﬁbres SxM do not need to depend smoothly on the base point x. However,
comparing to the setting of spinors in Minkowski space or on a Lorentzian manifold,
one important structure is missing: we have no Dirac matrices and no notion of
Clifford multiplication. The following deﬁnition is a step towards introducing these
additional structures.
Deﬁnition 1.4 (Clifford subspace)
We denote the space of symmetric linear
operators on .Sx; :j:x/ by Symm.Sx/  L.Sx/. A subspace K  Symm.Sx/ is

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
323
called a Clifford subspace of signature .r; s/ at the point x (with r; s 2 N0) if the
following conditions hold:
(i) For any u; v 2 K, the anti-commutator fu; vg  uv C vu is a multiple of the
identity on Sx.
(ii) The bilinear form h:; :i on K deﬁned by
1
2 fu; vg D hu; vi

for all u; v 2 K
(21)
is non-degenerate and has signature .r; s/.
In view of the anti-commutation relations (21), a Clifford subspace can be regarded
as a generalization of the space spanned by the usual Dirac matrices. However,
the above deﬁnition has two shortcomings: First, there are many different Clifford
subspaces, so that there is no unique notion of Clifford multiplication. Second, we
are missing the structure of tangent vectors as well as a mapping which would
associate a tangent vector to an element of the Clifford subspace.
These shortcomings can be overcome by using either geometric or measure-
theoretic methods. In the geometric approach, one gets along with the non-
uniqueness of the Clifford subspaces by working with suitable equivalence classes.
Using geometric information encoded in the causal fermion system, one can then
construct mappings between the equivalence classes at different space-time points.
This method will be outlined in Sect. 1.6. In the measure-theoretic approach, on
the other hand, one uses the local form of the universal measure with the aim
of constructing a unique Clifford subspace at every space-time point. This will
be outlined in Sect. 1.7. Before entering these geometric and measure-theoretic
constructions, we introduce additional structures on the space of wave functions.
1.5
The Fermionic Projector on the Krein Space
The space of wave functions can be endowed with an inner product and a topology.
The inner product is deﬁned by
< j> D
Z
M
 .x/j.x/x d.x/ :
(22)
In order to ensure that the last integral converges, we also introduce the scalar
product hh:j:ii by
hh jii D
Z
M
h .x/j jxj .x/iH d.x/
(23)

324
F. Finster
(where jxj is again the absolute value of the symmetric operator x on H). The one-
particle space .K; <:j:>/ is deﬁned as the space of wave functions for which the
corresponding norm jjj: jjj is ﬁnite, with the topology induced by this norm, and
endowed with the inner product <:j:>. Such an indeﬁnite inner product space with
a topology induced by an additional scalar product is referred to as a Krein space
(see for example [2, 32]).
When working with the one-particle Krein space, one must keep in mind that
the physical wave function  u of a vector u 2 H does not need to be a vector
in K because the corresponding integral in (22) may diverge. Similarly, the scalar
product hh uj uii may be inﬁnite. One could impose conditions on the causal
fermion system which ensure that the integrals in (22) and (23) are ﬁnite for
all physical wave functions. Then the mapping u 7!  u would give rise to an
embedding H ,! K of the Hilbert space H into the one-particle Krein space.
However, such conditions seem too restrictive and are not really needed. Therefore,
here we shall not impose any conditions on the causal fermion systems but simply
keep in mind that the physical wave functions are in general no Krein vectors.
Despite this shortcoming, the Krein space is useful because the kernel of the
fermionic projector gives rise to an operator on K. Namely, choosing a suitable
dense domain of deﬁnition3 D.P/, we can regard P.x; y/ as the integral kernel of a
corresponding operator P,

referred to as the fermionic projector. The fermionic projector has the following two

The symmetry of the kernel of the fermionic projector (13) implies that
P.x; y/ .y/ j  .x/x D  .y/ j P.y; x/ .x/y :
Integrating over x and y and applying (24) and (22) gives the result.

Geometric Structures
A causal fermion system also encodes geometric information on space-time. More
speciﬁcally, in the paper [14] notions of connection and curvature are introduced and
analyzed. We now outline a few constructions from this paper. Recall that the kernel
of the fermionic projector (11) is a mapping from one spin space to another, thereby
inducing relations between different space-time points. The idea is to use these
relations for the construction of a spin connection Dx;y, being a unitary mapping
between the corresponding spin spaces,
Dx;y W Sy ! Sx
(we consistently use the notation that the subscript xy denotes an object at the
point x, whereas the additional comma x;y denotes an operator which maps an object
at y to an object at x). The simplest method for constructing the spin connection
would be to form a polar decomposition, P.x; y/ D A

xy U, and to introduce the
spin connection as the unitary part, Dx;y D U. However, this method is too naive,
because we want the spin connection to be compatible with a corresponding metric
connection rx;y which should map Clifford subspaces at x and y (see Deﬁnition 1.4
above) isometrically to each other. A complication is that, as discussed at the end
of Sect. 1.4, the Clifford subspaces at x and y are not unique. The method to bypass
these problems is to work with several Clifford subspaces and to use so-called splice
maps, as we now brieﬂy explain.
First, it is useful to restrict the freedom in choosing the Clifford subspaces with
the following construction. Recall that for any x 2 M, the operator .x/ on H
has at most n positive and at most n negative eigenvalues. We denote its positive
and negative spectral subspaces by SC
x and S
x , respectively. In view of (14), these
subspaces are also orthogonal with respect to the spin scalar product,
Sx D SC
x ˚ S
x :
We introduce the Euclidean sign operator sx as a symmetric operator on Sx whose
eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues ˙1 are the spaces SC
x
and S
x ,
respectively. Since s2

F. Finster
dimensional Clifford subspace of signature .1; 0/. The idea is to extend sx to obtain
higher-dimensional Clifford subspaces. We thus deﬁne a Clifford extension as a
Clifford subspace which contains sx. By restricting attention to Clifford extensions,
we have reduced the freedom in choosing Clifford subspaces. However, there is still
not a unique Clifford extension, even for ﬁxed dimension and signature. But one
can deﬁne the tangent space Tx as an equivalence class of Clifford extensions; for
details see [14, Section 3.1]. The bilinear form h:; :i in (21) induces a Lorentzian
metric on the tangent space.
Next, for our constructions to work, we need to assume that the points x and y
are both regular and are properly timelike separated, deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 1.5 A space-time point x 2 M is said to be regular if x has the maximal
possible rank, i.e. dim x.H/ D 2n. Otherwise, the space-time point is called
singular.
In most situations of physical interest (like Dirac see conﬁgurations to be discussed
in Sects. 2 and 5 below), all space-time points are regular. Singular points, on the
other hand, should be regarded as exceptional points or “singularities” of space-
time.
Deﬁnition 1.6 The space-time points x; y 2 M are properly timelike separated if
the closed chain Axy, (12), has a strictly positive spectrum and if all eigenspaces are
deﬁnite subspaces of .Sx; :j:x/.
By a deﬁnite subspace of Sx we mean a subspace on which the inner product :j:x
is either positive or negative deﬁnite.
The two following observations explain why the last deﬁnition makes sense:
I Properly timelike separation implies timelike separation (according to Deﬁni-
tion 1.2):
Before entering the proof, we give a simple counter example which shows
why the assumption of deﬁnite eigenspaces in Deﬁnition 1.6 is necessary for the
implication to hold. Namely, if the point x is regular and Axy is the identity, then
the eigenvalues 1; : : : ; 2n are all strictly positive, but they are all equal.
If I  Sx is a deﬁnite invariant subspace of Axy, then the restriction AxyjI is a
symmetric operator on the Hilbert space .I; ˙:j:II/, which is diagonalizable
with real eigenvalues. Moreover, the orthogonal complement I? of I  Sx
is again invariant. If I? is non-trivial, the restriction AxyjI? has at least one
eigenspace. Therefore, the assumption in Deﬁnition 1.6 that all eigenspaces are
deﬁnite makes it possible to proceed inductively to conclude that the operator Axy
is diagonalizable and has real eigenvalues.
If x and y are properly timelike separated, then its eigenvalues are by deﬁnition
all real and positive. Thus it remains to show that they are not all the same. If
conversely they were all the same, i.e. 1 D    D 2n D  > 0, then Sx
would necessarily have the maximal dimension 2n. Moreover, the fact that Axy
is diagonalizable implies that Axy would be a multiple of the identity on Sx.

327
Therefore, the spin space .Sx; :j:/ would have to be deﬁnite, in contradiction
to the fact that it has signature .n; n/.
I The notion is symmetric in x and y:
Suppose that Axyu D u with u 2 Sx and  2 R n f0g. Then the vector w WD
P.y; x/ u 2 Sy is an eigenvector of Ayx again to the eigenvalue ,
Ayx w D P.y; x/P.x; y/ P.y; x/ u
D P.y; x/ Axy u D  P.y; x/ u D w :
Moreover, the calculation
 uju D ujAxyu D u j P.x; y/ P.y; x/ u
D P.y; x/u j P.y; x/u D wjw
shows that w is a deﬁnite vector if and only if u is. We conclude that Ayx
has positive eigenvalues and deﬁnite eigenspaces if and only if Axy has these
properties.
So far, the construction of the spin connection has been worked out only in the
case of spin dimension n D 2. Then for two regular and properly timelike separated
points x; y 2 M, the spin space Sx can be decomposed uniquely into an orthogonal
direct sum Sx D IC ˚ I of a two-dimensional positive deﬁnite subspace IC and
a two-dimensional negative deﬁnite subspace I of Axy. We deﬁne the directional
sign operator vxy of Axy as the unique operator with eigenvalues 1; 1; 0 such that
the eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues ˙1 are the subspaces I˙.
Having the Euclidean sign operator sx and the directional sign operator vxy
to our disposal, under generic assumptions one can distinguish two Clifford
subspaces at the point x: a Clifford subspace Kxy containing vxy and a Clifford
extension K.y/
x
(for details see [14, Lemma 3.12]). Similarly, at the point y we
have a distinguished Clifford subspace Kyx (which contains vyx) and a distinguished
Clifford extension K.x/
y . For the construction of the spin connection Dx;y W Sy ! Sx
one works with the Clifford subspaces Kxy and Kyx and demands that these are
mapped to each other. More precisely, the spin connection is uniquely characterized
by the following properties (see [14, Theorem 3.20]):
(i) Dx;y is of the form

328
F. Finster
The spin connection has the properties
Dy;x D .Dx;y/1 D .Dx;y/
and
Axy D Dx;y Ayx Dy;x :
All the assumptions needed for the construction of the spin connection are combined
in the notion that x and y must be spin-connectable (see [14, Deﬁnition 3.17]). We
remark that in the limiting case of a Lorentzian manifold, the points x and y are
spin-connectable if they are timelike separated and sufﬁciently close to each other
(see [14, Section 5]).
By composing the spin connection along a discrete “path” of space-time points,
one obtains a “parallel transport” of spinors. When doing so, it is important to
keep track of the different Clifford subspaces and to carefully transform them to
each other. In order to illustrate in an example how this works, suppose that we
want to compose the spin connection Dy;z with Dz;x. As mentioned above, the spin
connection Dz;x at the point z is constructed using the Clifford subspace Kzx. The
spin connection Dy;z, however, takes at the same space-time point z the Clifford
subspace Kzy as reference. This entails that before applying Dy;z we must transform
from the Clifford subspace Kzx to the Clifford subspace Kzy. This is accomplished
by the splice map U.yjx/
z
, being a uniquely deﬁned unitary transformation of Sx with
the property that
Kzy D U.yjx/
z
Kzx

U.yjx/
z
 :
The splice map must be sandwiched between the spin connections in combinations
like
Dy;z U.yjx/
z
Dz;x :
In order to construct a corresponding metric connection rx;y, one uses a similar
procedure to related the Clifford subspaces to corresponding Clifford extensions.
More precisely, one ﬁrst unitarily transform the Clifford extension K.x/
y
to the
Clifford subspace Kyx. Unitarily transforming with the spin connection Dxy gives
the Clifford subspace Kxy. Finally, one unitarily transforms to the Clifford exten-
sion K.y/
x . Since the Clifford extensions at the beginning and end are representatives
of the corresponding tangent spaces, we thus obtain an isometry
rx;y W Ty ! Tx
between the tangent spaces (for details see [14, Section 3.4]).
In this setting, curvature is deﬁned as usual as the holonomy of the connection.
Thus the curvature of the spin connection is given by
R.x; y; z/ D U.zjy/
x
Dx;y U.xjz/
y
Dy;z U.yjx/
z
Dz;x W Sx ! Sx ;

and similarly for the metric connection. In [14, Sections 4 and 5] it is proven
that the above notions in fact reduce to the spinorial Levi-Civita connection and
the Riemannian curvature on a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold if the
causal fermion system is constructed by regularizing solutions of the Dirac equation
(similar as will explained in the next section for the Minkowski vacuum) and
the regularization is suitably removed. These results show that the notions of
connection and curvature deﬁned above indeed generalize the corresponding notions
in Lorentzian spin geometry.
1.7
Topological Structures
From a mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a framework for
non-smooth geometries or generalized “quantum geometries.” In this context, it is of
interest how the topological notions on a differentiable manifold or a spin manifold
generalize to causal fermion systems. Such topological questions are analyzed
in [18], as we now brieﬂy summarize.
By deﬁnition, space-time M is a topological space (see Sect. 1.2). Attaching to
every space-time point x 2 M the corresponding spin space Sx gives the structure
of a sheaf, making it possible to describe the topology by sheaf cohomology. If one
assumes in addition that all space-time points are regular (see Deﬁnition 1.5), then
all spin spaces are isomorphic, giving rise to a topological vector bundle.
In order to get the connection to spinor bundles, one needs the additional
structure of Clifford multiplication. As explained in Sect. 1.4, the notion of a
Clifford subspace (see Deﬁnition 1.4) makes it possible to deﬁne Clifford structures
at every space-time point, but the deﬁnition is not unique and does not give the
connection to tangent vectors of the base space. In Sect. 1.6 these shortcomings
where bypassed by working with suitable equivalence classes of Clifford subspaces.
From the topological point of view, the basic question is whether one can choose
a representative of this equivalence class at each space-time point in such a way
that the representative depends continuously on the base point. This leads to the
notion of a Clifford section C`, being a continuous mapping which to every space-
time point x 2 M associates a corresponding Clifford subspace C`x (for details
see [18, Section 4.1]). Choosing a Clifford section leads to the structure of a so-
called topological spinor bundle. An advantage of working with topological spinor
bundles is that no notion of differentiability is required.
If M has a differentiable structure, one would like to associate a tangent
vector u 2 TxM to a corresponding element of the Clifford subspace C`x. This
leads to the notion of a spin structure  on a topological spinor bundle, being a
continuous mapping which to every x 2 M associates a mapping x W TxM ! C`x.
The topological obstructions for the existence of a spin structure on a topological
spinor bundle generalize the spin condition on a spin manifold (for details see [18,
Sections 4.2 and 4.5]).

330
F. Finster
A useful analytic tool for the construction of Clifford sections are so-called
tangent cone measures (see [18, Section 5]). These measures make it possible to
analyze the local structure of space-time in a neighborhood of a point x 2 M (again
without any differentiability assumptions). The tangent cone measures can be used
to distinguish a speciﬁc Clifford subspace C`x and to relate C`x to neighboring
space-time points.
We close with two remarks. First, all the above constructions generalize to the
Riemannian setting if the deﬁnition of causal fermion systems is extended to so-
called topological fermion systems (see [18, Deﬁnition 2.1]). We thus obtain a
mathematical framework to describe spinors on singular spaces (see [18, Sections 7
and 8] for many examples). Second, one can introduce nontrivial topological notions
even for discrete space-times by constructing neighborhoods of M in F (using the
metric structure of F induced by the norm on the Banach space L.H/) and by
studying the topology of these neighborhoods.
2
Correspondence to Minkowski Space
In order to put the abstract framework in a simple and concrete context, we now
explain how to describe Dirac spinors in Minkowski space as a causal fermion
system.
2.1
Concepts Behind the Construction of Causal Fermion
Systems
We let .M; h:; :i/ be Minkowski space (with the signature convention .C  /)
and d	 the standard volume measure (thus d	 D d4x in a reference frame x D
.x0; : : : ; x3/). We denote the spinor space at a point x 2 M by SxM, so that a Dirac
wave function  takes values in
 .x/ 2 SxM ' C4 :
The spinor space at x is endowed with an indeﬁnite inner product of signature .2; 2/,
which as in physics textbooks we denote by   (where  D  0 is the usual
adjoint spinor). Clearly, in Minkowski space one has a trivial parallel transport
of spinors, making it possible to identify the spinor spaces at different space-
time points. Thus the space-time index SxM of the spinor space is added only for
notational clarity.

(26)
making the solution space to a separable Hilbert space. We choose H as a closed
subspace of this Hilbert space with the induced scalar product h:j:iH WD .:j:/jHH.
Clearly, H is again a separable Hilbert space. In order to describe the vacuum
(i.e. the physical system where no particles and anti-particles are present), one
chooses H as the subspace spanned by all the negative-energy solutions (the “Dirac
sea vacuum”). To describe particles or anti-particles, one includes positive-energy
solutions or leaves out negative-energy solutions, respectively. But any other closed
subspace of the solution space may be chosen as well. We remark for clarity that
in this section, we only consider the vacuum Dirac equation (25), so that the Dirac
particles do not interact (interacting systems will be discussed in Sect. 5 below).
In order to get into the framework of causal fermion systems, to every space-time
point x 2 M we want to associate a linear operator F.x/ 2 F. Once this has been
accomplished, the resulting mapping
F W M ! F :
(27)
can be used to introduce a measure  on F. Namely, we say that a subset   F
is measurable if and only if its pre-image F1./ is a measurable subset of M.
Moreover, we deﬁne the measure of  as the space-time volume of the pre-image,
./ WD 	.F1.//. This construction is commonly used in mathematical analysis
and is referred to as the push-forward measure, denoted by
 D F	 :
Then .H; F; / will be a causal fermion system.
The basic idea for constructing F.x/ is to represent the inner product on the
spinors in terms of the Hilbert space scalar product, i.e.
h jF.x/iH D . /.x/
for all  ;  2 H :
(28)
The operator F.x/ gives information on the densities and correlations of the Dirac
wave functions at the space-time point x. It is referred to as the local correlation
operator at x. Relating the maximal number of positive and negative eigenvalues
of F.x/ to the signature of the inner product . /.x/, one sees that F.x/ indeed
has at most two positive and at most two negative eigenvalues. However, Eq. (28)
suffers from the shortcoming that the right side is in general ill-deﬁned because
solutions  ;  2 H are in general not continuous and thus cannot be evaluated
pointwise. This is the reason why we need to introduce an ultraviolet regularization
(UV regularization). Before entering the analysis, we ﬁrst outline our method and

332
F. Finster
explain the physical picture in a few remarks. The mathematical construction will
be given afterwards in Sect. 2.2.
In order to put our constructions in the general physical context, we ﬁrst note
that UV regularizations are frequently used in relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory as
a technical tool to remove divergences. A common view is that the appearance
of such divergences indicates that the physical theory is incomplete and should
be replaced for very small distances by another, more fundamental theory. The
renormalization program is a method to get along with standard quantum ﬁeld
theory by ﬁnding a way of dealing with the divergences. The ﬁrst step is the
UV regularization, which is usually a set of prescriptions which make divergent
integrals ﬁnite. The next step of the renormalization program is to show that the
UV regularization can be taken out if other parameters of the theory (like masses
and coupling constants) are suitably rescaled. Conceptually, in the renormalization
program the UV regularization merely is a technical tool. All predictions of theory
should be independent of how the regularization is carried out.
In the context of causal fermion systems, however, the physical picture behind
the UV regularization is quite different. Namely, in our setting the regularized
objects are to be considered as the fundamental physical objects. Therefore, the
regularization has a physical signiﬁcance. It should describe the microscopic
structure of physical space-time.
Before explaining this physical picture in more detail, we need to introduce
a microscopic length scale " > 0 on which the UV regularization should come
into play. Regularization lengths are often associated to the Planck length `P 
1:6  1035 m. The analysis of the gravitational ﬁeld in [6] suggests that " should be
chosen even much smaller than the Planck length (see [6, Section 4.9 and §5.4.3]).
Even without entering a detailed discussion of the length scales, it is clear that " will
be by many orders of magnitude smaller than most other physical length scales of
the system. Therefore, it is a sensible method to analyze the causal action principle
in the asymptotics when " is very small. In order to make such an asymptotics
mathematically precise, we necessarily need to consider the regularization length "
as a variable parameter taking values in an interval .0; "max/. Only for such a
variable parameter, one can analyze the asymptotics as " & 0.
For any " 2 .0; "max/, similar to (27) we shall construct a mapping F" W
M ! F by suitably inserting an UV regularization in (28). Then we construct
the corresponding universal measure as the push-forward by F", i.e.
" WD F"
	 :
(29)
This shall give rise to a causal fermion system .H; F; "/. We will also explain how
to identify the objects in Minkowski space with corresponding objects of the causal
fermion system:

With these identiﬁcations made, the structures of Minkowski space are no longer
needed. They are encoded in the causal fermion system, and we may describe the
physical space-time exclusively by the causal fermion system. We consider the
objects with UV regularization as described by the causal fermion system as the
fundamental physical objects.
In the following remarks we elaborate on the physical picture behind the UV
regularization and explain why our setting is sufﬁciently general to describe the
physical situation we have in mind.
Remark 2.1 (method of variable regularization) As just explained, the only reason
for considering a family of causal fermion systems is to give the asymptotics " & 0
a precise mathematical meaning. But from the physical point of view, a speciﬁc
regularization for a speciﬁc value of " should be distinguished by the fact that
the corresponding causal fermion system .H; F; "/ describes our physical space-
time. We again point out that this concept is different from standard quantum
ﬁeld theory, where the regularization merely is a technical tool used in order to
remove divergences. In our setting, the regularization has a physical signiﬁcance.
The regularized objects are to be considered as the fundamental physical objects,
and the regularization is a method to describe the microscopic structure of physical
space-time.
This concept immediately raises the question how the “physical regularization”
should look like. Generally speaking, the regularized space-time should look like
Minkowski space down to distances of the scale ". For distances smaller than ",
the structure of space-time may be completely different. The simplest method of
regularizing is to “smear out” or “mollify” all wave functions on the scale " (this
corresponds to Example 2.4 below). But it is also conceivable that space-time has a
non-trivial microstructure on the scale ", which cannot be guessed or extrapolated
from the structures of Minkowski space. Since experiments on the length scale "
seem out of reach, it is completely unknown what the microscopic structure of
space-time is. Nevertheless, we can hope that we can get along without knowing
this micro-structure, because the detailed form of this micro-structure might have
no inﬂuence on the effective physical equations which are valid on the energy
scales accessible to experiments. More precisely, the picture is that the general
structure of the effective physical equations should be independent of the micro-
structure of space-time. Values of mass ratios or coupling constants, however, may
well depend on the micro-structure (a typical example is the gravitational constant,
which is closely tied to the Planck length, which in turn is related to " as explained
in [6, Section 4.9]). In more general terms, the unknown micro-structure of space-

334
F. Finster
time should enter the effective physical equations only by a ﬁnite (hopefully small)
number of free parameters, which can then be taken as empirical free parameters of
the effective macroscopic theory.
Clearly, the above picture must be questioned and supported by mathematical
results. To this end, one needs to analyze in detail how the effective macroscopic
theory depends on the regularization. For this reason, it is not sufﬁcient to consider
a speciﬁc family of regularizations. Instead, one must analyze a whole class of
regularizations which is so large that it covers all relevant regularization effects.
This strategy is referred to as the method of variable regularization (for a longer
explanation see [8, §4.1]). It is the reason why in Deﬁnition 2.3 below we shall only
state properties of the regularization, but we do not specify how precisely it should
look like.
Þ
Remark 2.2 (sequences of ﬁnite-dimensional regularizations) The critical reader
may wonder why we consider a family of regularizations .H; F; "/ parametrized
by a continuous parameter .0; "max/. Would it not be more suitable to consider
instead a sequence of causal fermion systems .H`; F`; `/ which asymptotically
as ` ! 1 describes Minkowski space? A related question is why we constructed
the measure  as the push-forward of the Lebesgue measure (29). Would it not
be better to work with more general measures such as to allow for the possibility
of discrete micro-structures? The answer to these questions is that it is no loss of
generality and a simply a matter of convenience to work with the family .H; F; "/
with " 2 .0; "max/, as we now explain.
We ﬁrst point out that we do not demand our family .H; F; "/ to be in
any sense “continuous” in the parameter ". Therefore, one can also describe a
sequence .H; F; `/ simply by choosing the family " to be piecewise constant,
for example
" D `
if
1
` 	 " <
1
` C 1 :
Similarly, it is no loss of generality to take  as the push-forward measure of
the Lebesgue measure because F".x/ need not depend continuously on x 2 M.
For example, one can arrange a discrete space-time like a space-time lattice
by choosing F" as a mapping which is piecewise constant on little cubes of
Minkowski space. Clearly, this mapping is not continuous, but it is continuous
almost everywhere. Moreover, its image is a discrete set, corresponding to a discrete
micro-structure of space-time. For the method for representing a general measure 
as the push-forward of for example the Lebesgue measure we refer the interested
reader to the proof of [10, Lemma 1.4].
The remaining question is why we may keep the Hilbert space H ﬁxed. In
particular, we noted in Sect. 1.1 that the existence of minimizers of the causal
action principle has been proven only if H is ﬁnite-dimensional. Therefore, should
one not consider a ﬁltration H1  H2      H of H by ﬁnite-dimensional
subspaces? Indeed, from the conceptual point of view, this would be the correct

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
335
way to proceed. Nevertheless, the following consideration explains why we can just
as well replace all the Hilbert spaces H` by the larger space H: For a given causal
fermion system .H`; F`; `/ with H`  H, by extending all operators by zero to the
orthogonal complement of H`, one obtains the so-called extended causal fermion
system .H; F; `/. The fact that the causal fermion system was extended can still be
seen by forming the so-called effective Hilbert space as
Heff D spanfx.H/ j x 2 supp g :
Namely, for an extended causal fermion system, the effective Hilbert space still is
a subset of the original Hilbert space, Heff  H`. Moreover, the support of the
extended causal fermion system is still contained in F`  L.H`/. Therefore, we do
not lose any information by extending a causal fermion system. Conversely, when
analyzing a causal fermion system, it seems preferable to always make the Hilbert
space as small as possible by taking Heff as the underlying Hilbert space.
The delicate point about extending causal fermion systems is that the causal
action principle does depend sensitively on the dimension of the underlying Hilbert
space H. More speciﬁcally, the inﬁmum of the action is known to be strictly
decreasing in the dimension of H (see the estimates in [9, Lemma 5.1], which
apply similarly in the more general setting of [10]). Therefore, a minimizer  of
the causal action principle will no longer be a minimizer if the causal fermion
system is extended. However, the ﬁrst order Euler-Lagrange equations (for details
see Sect. 4.1 below) are still satisﬁed for the extended causal fermion system.
Therefore, for convenience we ﬁx the Hilbert space H and consider a family of
causal fermion systems .H; F; "/ thereon. In order for the causal action principle
to be well-deﬁned and for " to be a minimizer, one should replace H by the
corresponding effective Hilbert space Heff, which may depend on " and should be
arranged to be ﬁnite-dimensional. For the analysis of the Euler-Lagrange equations,
however, the restriction to Heff is unnecessary, and it is preferable to work with the
extended Hilbert space H.
Þ
We ﬁnally remark that the hurried reader who wants to skip the following
constructions may read instead the introductory section [17, Section 1.1] where
formal considerations without UV regularization are given. Moreover, a more ex-
plicit analysis of four-dimensional Minkowski space with a particularly convenient
regularization is presented in [14, Section 4]. For a somewhat simpler analysis of
two-dimensional Minkowski space we refer to [18, Section 7.2].
2.2
Introducing an Ultraviolet Regularization
We now enter the construction of the UV regularization. We denote the continuous
Dirac wave functions (i.e. the continuous sections of the spinor bundle, not neces-
sarily solutions of the Dirac equation) by C0.M; SM /. Similarly, the smooth wave

336

functions with compact support in a subset K  M are denoted by C1
0 .K; SM /.
For the Ck-norms we use the notation
jjCk.K/ D
X
j˛j	k

x2K
j@˛.x/j
for  2 C1
0 .K; SM / ;
where the ˛ are multi-indices. Here j:j is any pointwise norm on the spinor spaces
(we again identify all spinor spaces with the trivial parallel transport). Since any two
such norms can be estimated from above and below by a constant, the Ck-norms
corresponding to different choices of the norms j:j are also equivalent. For example,
one can choose j j2 WD  0 similar to the integrand in the scalar product (26).
But clearly, other choices are possible just as well.
The UV regularization is performed most conveniently with so-called regulariza-
tion operators, which we now deﬁne.
Deﬁnition 2.3 Consider a family of linear operators .R"/ with 0 < " < "max which
map H to the continuous wave functions,

again a solution of the Dirac equation. This could be imposed (as is done in [25,

Section 4]), but doing so seems too restrictive for the physical applications. We also
note that “almost all” in (ii) refers to the standard volume measure d	 on M.
For the mathematically interested reader we remark that the above properties (i)
and (ii) are very similar to the assumptions in the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem (see for
example [5, Section VII.5] or [35, Theorem 7.25]). In fact, if we replaced “almost
all” in (ii) by “all”, one could apply the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem and restate the
properties (i) and (ii) equivalently by saying that taking the image R".B1.0// of
the unit ball in H and restricting the resulting family of functions to any compact
set K  M, one obtains a relatively compact subset of C0.K; SM /. It is remarkable
that the properties (i) and (ii) come up naturally as conditions for a sensible UV
regularization, although we shall never use compactness arguments in our proofs.
Weakening “all” by “almost all” in (ii) makes it possible to describe discrete space-
times like space-time lattices, as was mentioned in Remark 2.2 above.
Simple examples of regularization operators are obtained by mollifying the wave
functions on the scale ":

Given a family of regularization operators, we can construct causal fermion
systems as follows. We ﬁx " 2 .0; "max/. For any x 2 M, we consider the bilinear
form
bx W H  H ! C ;
bx.u; v/ D .R" u/.x/.R" v/.x/ :
(35)

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
339
This bilinear form is well-deﬁned and bounded because R" is deﬁned pointwise and
because evaluation at x gives a linear operator of ﬁnite rank. Thus for any v 2 H, the
anti-linear form bx.:; v/ W H ! C is continuous. By the Fréchet-Riesz theorem (see
for example [33, Section 6.3]), there is a unique vector w 2 H such that bx.u; v/ D
hujwiH for all u 2 H. The mapping v 7! w is linear and bounded. We thus obtain a
bounded linear operator F".x/ on H such that
bx.u; v/ D hu j F".x/ viH
for all u; v 2 H :
Taking into account that the inner product on the Dirac spinors at x has signa-
ture .2; 2/, the local correlation operator F".x/ is a symmetric operator on H of rank
at most four, which has at most two positive and at most two negative eigenvalues.
Finally, we introduce the universal measure " D F"
	 as the push-forward of the
volume measure on M under the mapping F". In this way, for every " 2 .0; "0/ we
obtain a causal fermion system .H; F; "/ of spin dimension n D 2.
2.3
Correspondence of Space-Time
We now explain the connection between points of Minkowski space and points of
space-time M" WD supp " of the corresponding causal fermion system .H; F; "/.
We begin with a general characterization of M".
Proposition 2.5 For any " 2 .0; "max/, there is a subset E  M of 	-measure zero
such that the mapping F"jMnE W M n E ! F is continuous. Moreover, the support
of the universal measure M" WD supp " is given by
M" D F".M n E/
L.H/ :
(36)
Proof To show continuity, we need to estimate the sup-norm kF".x/  F".y/k. We
ﬁrst write the expectation value of the corresponding operator by
hu j

F".x/  F".y/

viH D .R" u/.x/.R" v/.x/ C .R" u/.y/.R" v/.y/

ˇˇ.R" v/.x/  .R" v/.y/
ˇˇ C
ˇˇ.R" u/.x/  .R" u/.y/
ˇˇ j.R" v/.y/j :
We now estimate the resulting spinor norms with the help of properties (i) and (ii)
of Deﬁnition 2.3. First, we denote the exceptional set of 	-measure zero where (31)
does not hold by E  M. Combining (30) and (31), one immediately sees that every

340
F. Finster
point x 2 M n E has a neighborhood U such that the boundedness property (30)
holds uniformly on U (i.e. j.R"u/.y/j 	 c kukH for all y 2 U). We thus obtain the
estimate
ˇˇhu j

F".x/  F".y/

viH
ˇˇ 	 2c ı kukH kvkH ;
valid for all y 2 U and u; v 2 H. Hence the sup-norm is bounded by kF".x/ 
F".y/k 	 2cı, showing that F" is continuous on M n E.
It remains to prove (36). Since 	.E/ D 0, the set E can be disregarded
when forming the push-forward measure. Therefore, taking into account that the
support of a measure is by deﬁnition a closed set, it sufﬁces to show that for
every x 2 M n E, the operator p WD F".x/ lies in the support of ". Let U  F
be an open neighborhood of p. Then the continuity of F" at x implies that the
preimage .F"/1.U/ is an open subset of M. Hence the Lebesgue measure of this
subset is non-zero, 	..F"/1.U// > 0. By deﬁnition of the push-forward measure,
it follows that ".U/ > 0. Hence every neighborhood of p has a non-zero measure,
implying that p 2 supp ". This concludes the proof.
ut
In order to have a convenient notation, in what follows we always identify a point
in Minkowski space with the corresponding operator of the causal fermion system,
identify
x 2 M
with
F".x/ 2 F :
(37)
In general, this identiﬁcation is not one-to-one, because the mapping F" need
not be injective. In the latter case, there are two points x; y 2 M such that the
bilinear forms bx and by coincide (see (35)). In other words, all correlations between
regularized wave functions coincide at the points x and y. Using a more physical
language, this means that the points x; y of Minkowski space are not distinguishable
by any experiments performed on the fermionic wave functions. We take the point
of view that in such situations, the points x and y should not be distinguished
physically, and that it is reasonable and desirable that the two points are identiﬁed in
the causal fermion system with the same space-time point F".x/ D F".y/ 2 M" WD
supp ". In philosophical terms, our construction realizes the principle of the identity
of indiscernibles.
We also remark that, due to the closure in (36), it may happen that the space-
time M" contains a point z which does not lie in the image of F", but is merely a limit
point in F".M/. In this case, the corresponding bilinear form b.u; v/ WD hujzviH
can be approximated with an arbitrarily small error by bilinear forms bx with x 2 M.
Since experiments always involve small imprecisions, we take the point of view that
it is again reasonable and desirable mathematically to include z into the space-time
points.
Generally speaking, the just-discussed cases that F" is not injective or its image is
not closed seem mostly of academic interest. In most applications, the mapping F"
will be injective and closed. In all these situations, Proposition 2.5 will give us a
one-to-one correspondence between points x 2 M and points F".x/ 2 M".

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
341
We ﬁnally note that, working with the push-forward measure (29), the volume
measure on space-time M" as deﬁned by the universal measure d" always agrees
under the identiﬁcation (37) with the Lebesgue measure d	 on M.
2.4
Correspondence of Spinors and Wave Functions
We proceed by explaining the connection between the spinor space SxM at a
point x 2 M of Minkowski space and the corresponding spin space SxM  H
of the causal fermion system (where we use the identiﬁcation (37)). This will also
make it possible to get a connection between Dirac wave functions in Minkowski
space and wave functions as deﬁned in Sect. 1.4. In preparation, we derive useful
explicit formulas for the local correlation operators. To this end, for any x 2 M we
deﬁne the evaluation map e"
x by
e"
x W H ! SxM ;
e"
x  D .R" /.x/ :
(38)
Its adjoint is deﬁned as usual, taking into account the corresponding inner products
on the domain and the target space, i.e.

We denote this adjoint by "

The next proposition gives the desired connection between the spinor space SxM
and the corresponding spin space SxM. We ﬁrst state and prove the proposition and
explain it afterwards.
Proposition 2.6 The mapping
e"
xjSx W SxM ! SxM
is an isometric embedding :

This proposition makes it possible to identify the spin space SxM  H endowed
with the inner product :j:x with a subspace of the spinor space SxM with the inner
product  . If the point x is singular, this is all we can expect, because in this case
the spaces SxM and SxM have different dimensions and are clearly not isomorphic.
As already mentioned after Deﬁnition 1.5, in most situations of physical interest the
point x will be regular. In this case, we even obtain an isomorphism of SxM and SxM
which preserves the inner products on these spaces. The identity (40) shows that,
under the above identiﬁcations, the physical wave function  u (as deﬁned by (16))
goes over to the regularized Dirac wave function .R"u/.x/. This shows again that
the causal fermion system involves the regularized objects. Moreover, one sees
that the abstract formalism introduced in Sect. 1 indeed gives agreement with the
usual objects in Minkowski space. We remark that the above isomorphism of SxM
and SxM also makes it possible to use unambiguously the same notation for the
corresponding inner product. Indeed, it is convenient denote the inner product on
the Dirac spinors at a time point x 2 M by
:j:x W SxM  SxM ! C ;
 jx D   :
In order to avoid confusion, we avoided this notation so far. But from now on we
will sometimes use it.

2.5
Correspondence of the Causal Structure
We now explain how the causal structure of Minkowski space is related to
corresponding notions of a causal fermion system (see Deﬁnition 1.2 and the time
direction (10)). To this end, we need to specify H as a closed subspace of the
solution space of the vacuum Dirac equation (25). Clearly, this Dirac equation can
be solved by the plane-wave ansatz
 .x/ D eikx k
with a constant spinor k. Evaluating the resulting algebraic equation for  shows
that the momentum k must lie on the mass shell k2 D m2. The solutions on the upper
and lower mass shell are the solutions of positive respectively negative energy. In
order to avoid potential confusion with other notions of energy (like energy densities
or energy expectation values), we here prefer the notion of solutions of positive and
negative frequency. Taking Dirac’s original concept literally, we here describe the
vacuum in Minkowski space by the completely ﬁlled Dirac sea. Thus we choose H
as the subspace of the solution space spanned by all plane-wave solutions of negative
frequency. We refer to this choice as a Dirac sea conﬁguration.
Lemma 2.8 If H is the subspace of the solution space of the Dirac equation (25)
spanned by all negative-frequency solutions, then the unregularized kernel of the
fermionic projector as deﬁned by (43) is the tempered bi-distribution
P.x; y/ D

(46)
where ‚ is the Heaviside function, and k.xy/ is a short notation for the Minkowski
inner product kj .x  y/j.
Proof The integrand in (46) clearly is a tempered distribution. Hence its Fourier
transform P.x; y/ is also a tempered distribution (in the vector y  x and also in
both vectors x and y). In addition, one veriﬁes by direct computation that P.x; y/ is
a distributional solution of the Dirac equation,

Due to the factor ‚.k0/, the distribution P.x; y/ is composed of solutions of
negative frequency. Moreover, since the matrix .=k C m/ has rank two, one sees
that P.x; y/ is indeed composed of all negative-frequency solutions. It remains to

The Fourier integral (46) can be computed in closed form, giving an expression
involving Bessel functions. In preparation, it is useful to pull the Dirac matrices out
of the Fourier integral. To this end, one rewrites the factor .=k C m/ in (46) in terms
of a differential operator in position space,

method is to subtract an explicit singular distribution and to show that the difference

a test function  2 C1

When taking the limit " & 0, one must be careful for two reasons. First, a
pole forms on the light cone t D ˙r. Second, the Bessel function K1 involves
logarithms, which must be evaluated in the complex plane using the branch cut
along the negative real axis. For clarity, we treat these two issues after each other.

We point out that the Bessel functions in (50) are all real-valued. In particular, one
sees that T.x; y/ is real-valued if the vector 
 is spacelike.
Using the result of Lemma 2.9 in (48), one can derive corresponding formulas
for P.x; y/. In particular, differentiating (49), one sees that P.x; y/ has an even
stronger singularity on the light cone which involves terms of the form 1=
4
and ı0.
2/. Differentiating (50), carrying out the derivatives with the chain rule
and using formulas for the derivatives of Bessel functions (see [34, (10.6.6)
and (10.29.4)]), one can also express the fermionic projector P.x; y/ in terms of
Bessel functions. We do not give the resulting formulas, because we do not need the
detailed form later on. Instead, we here prefer to argue with general properties of
the distribution P.x; y/. This makes it possible to infer qualitative properties of the
eigenvalues of Axy, even without referring to the detailed form of the formulas in
Lemma 2.9. From Lorentz symmetry, we know that for all x and y with spacelike or
timelike separation, P.x; y/ can be written as
P.x; y/ D ˛

Therefore, the eigenvalues of the closed chain are either real, or else they form a
complex conjugate pair. Which of the two cases appears is determined by the sign
of the factor 
2. This gives the agreement of the different notions of causality in the
following sense:
Proposition 2.10 Assume that P.x; y/ is the unregularized kernel of the fermionic
projector of the vacuum (46), and that the eigenvalues xy
1 ; : : : ; xy
4 are computed
as the eigenvalues of the closed chain (12). Then the following statements hold:
If the points x; y 2 M have spacelike separation in Minkowski space, then they
are also spacelike separated in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.2. If, on the other hand,
the points x; y 2 M have timelike separation in Minkowski space, then they are
also timelike separated in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.2. Even more, they are properly
timelike separated (see Deﬁnition 1.6) in the sense that the closed chain Axy has
strictly positive eigenvalues and deﬁnite eigenspaces. Finally, if the points x; y 2
M have lightlike separation in Minkowski space, then the causal structure of
Deﬁnition 1.2 is ill-deﬁned.
The fact that the causal structure is ill-deﬁned for lightlike separation again explains
why an UV regularization must be introduced.
Proof of Proposition 2.10 If the vector 
 D y  x is spacelike, then the term 
2 is
negative. Thus the eigenvalues in (56) form a complex conjugate pair, implying that
they all have the same absolute value. Thus the points are spacelike separated in the
sense of Deﬁnition 1.2.
If the vector 
 is timelike, the term 
2 in (56) is positive, so that the j are all real.
In order to show that they do not have the same absolute value, we need to verify
that the parameters a and b are both non-zero. This makes it necessary to refer to
the explicit formula involving Bessel functions (50): The Bessel functions Y1 and J1
do not have joint zeros on the positive real axis. As a consequence, the parameter ˇ
in (52) is non-zero. Likewise, the derivatives Y0
1 and J0
1 do not have joint zeros (as
can again be veriﬁed from the fact that the Bessel functions form a fundamental
system). This implies that the parameter ˛ in (52) is non-zero. We conclude that
the parameter b in (55) is non-zero. The combination of ˛ and ˇ in the formula
for a in (55) can be rewritten in terms of a Wronskian of the Bessel function. This
Wronskian can be computed explicitly using [34, (10.5.2)], implying that a is non-
zero. We conclude that the points x and y are timelike separated in the sense of
Deﬁnition 1.2.
In order to get the connection to proper timelike separation, recall that if 
 is
a timelike vector of Minkowski space, then the closed chain has the form (55)
with a; b ¤ 0. A direct computation shows that this matrix is diagonalizable and
that the eigenspaces are deﬁnite with respect to the spin scalar product. Moreover,
applying the Schwarz inequality to the explicit formulas (55), one obtains

proving that the eigenvalues in (56) are non-negative. It remains to show that none
of these eigenvalues vanishes. To this end, it sufﬁces to show that the inequality (?)
in (57) is strict, which in turn is equivalent to proving that
Im

This inequality follows by a detailed analysis of the Bessel functions (see [14, proof
of Lemma 4.3]). We conclude that x and y are indeed properly timelike separated.
If the vector 
 is lightlike, then P.x; y/ is not deﬁned pointwise. As a conse-
quence, the closed chain is ill-deﬁned.

This proposition cannot be applied directly to causal fermion systems because,
as explained in Sects. 2.1 and 2.2, constructing a causal fermion system makes it
necessary to introduce an UV regularization. Nevertheless, the above proposition
also gives correspondence of the different notions of causality for causal fermion
systems describing the Minkowski vacuum, as we now explain. Thus let us consider
the causal fermion system corresponding to the regularized fermionic projector of
the vacuum P".x; y/. In the limit " & 0, the kernel of the fermionic projector P".x; y/
converges to the unregularized kernel P.x; y/ (see (44) in Proposition 2.6). If this
convergence is pointwise, i.e. if for given space-time points x; y 2 M,
lim
"&0 P".x; y/ D P.x; y/ ;
(58)
then the results of Proposition 2.10 also apply to the causal fermion system, up
to error terms which tend to zero as " & 0. Thinking of " as the Planck scale,
this means physically that the notion of causality of Deﬁnition 1.2 agrees with the
usual notion of causality in Minkowski space, up to corrections which are so small
that they cannot be observed. The subtle point of this argument is that it requires
pointwise convergence (58). Clearly, such a pointwise convergence cannot hold if x
and y are lightlike separated, because the right side of (58) is ill-deﬁned pointwise.
Expressed for a causal fermion system for ﬁxed " on the Planck scale, this means
that the notion of causality of Deﬁnition 1.2 does not agree with the usual notion
of causality if the vector 
 is almost lightlike in the sense that
ˇˇj
0j  jE
j
ˇˇ . ".
This is not surprising because we cannot expect that the notion of causality in
Minkowski space holds with a higher resolution than the regularization scale ".
The remaining question is whether we have pointwise convergence (58) if the
points x and y have timelike or spacelike separation. The answer is yes for a
large class of regularizations (like for example the regularization by molliﬁcation
in Example 2.4). However, the general notion of Deﬁnition 2.3 only gives weak
convergence of the kernels (44). This shortcoming could be removed by adding a
condition to Deﬁnition 2.3 which ensures pointwise convergence away from the
light cone. On the other hand, such an additional condition seems unnecessary,
and therefore it seems preferable not to impose it. Nevertheless, the physical
picture is that the regularized kernel should converge pointwise, at least for generic
points x and y which lie sufﬁciently far away from the light cone. With this in

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
353
mind, Proposition 2.10 indeed shows that the notion of causality of Deﬁnition 1.2
corresponds to the usual notion of causality in Minkowski space, up to corrections
which are so small that they are irrelevant in most situations of interest.
We conclude this section by explaining why the functional C introduced in (9)
gives information on the time direction. Our ﬁrst task is to rewrite this functional in
terms of the regularized kernel of the fermionic projector P".x; y/.
Lemma 2.11 Assume that the operator P".x; x/ W SxM ! SxM is invertible. Then,
setting
.x/ D P".x; x/1 W SxM ! SxM ;

We point out that the operator .x/ in (59) is ill-deﬁned without UV regular-
ization because evaluating the distribution P.x; y/ on the diagonal x D y has no
mathematical meaning. As a consequence, the functional C is ill-deﬁned without UV
regularization, even if x and y have timelike separation. This makes the following
computation somewhat delicate. In order to keep the analysis reasonably simple,
we assume that the regularized kernel of the fermionic projector has vector-scalar
structure, meaning that it is of the general form
P".x; y/ D v"
j .x; y/ j C ˇ".x; y/

(61)

F. Finster
with a vectorial and a scalar component. Here v".x; y/ is a complex vector ﬁeld (i.e.
it can be written as v" D u" C iw" with Minkowski vectors u" and w" which need
not be collinear). Then, evaluating (61) for x D y, one sees that P".x; x/ can be
written as
P".x; x/ D v"
j .x/ j C ˇ".x/

(where we set v".x/ D v".x; x/ and ˇ".x/ D ˇ".x; x/). Since P".x; x/ is a symmetric
operator on SxM, it follows that v" is a real vector ﬁeld, and ˇ a real-valued function.
For a large class of regularizations, the matrix P".x; x/ is invertible because the
vectorial component dominates the scalar component. With this in mind, we here
assume that .x/ exists. Then it is given by

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
355
For the interpretation of the formula (63), we ﬁrst consider the case that y and x
have space-like separation. In this case, it turns out that the prefactor Im.˛ˇ/
vanishes, so that (63) gives no information on a time direction. This is consistent
with the fact that for points in Minkowski space with space-like separation, the
notions of future- and past-directed depend on the observer and cannot be deﬁned
in a covariant manner. However, if y and x have timelike separation, then the
factors a and Im.˛ˇ/ are indeed both non-zero (see the proof of Proposition 2.10).
Therefore, the functional C is non-zero, provided that the vector 
 is non-degenerate
in the sense that it is linearly independent of both v".x/ and v".y/. Since the
set of directions 
 for which these vectors are linearly dependent has measure
zero, we may always restrict attention to non-degenerate directions. Moreover, the
formula (63) shows that the functional C does not change sign for 
 inside the upper
or lower light cone. On the other hand, C is antisymmetric under sign ﬂips of 
because interchanging x and y in (9) obviously gives a minus sign.
We conclude that for the regularized Dirac sea vacuum, the sign of the func-
tional C distinguishes a time direction. Asymptotically as " & 0, this time direction
agrees with the distinction of the causal past and causal future in Minkowski space.
To summarize, in this section we saw how the intrinsic structures of a causal
fermion system correspond to the usual structures in Minkowski space. To this end,
we constructed causal fermion systems from a regularized Dirac sea conﬁguration
and analyzed the asymptotics as the UV regularization is removed. For brevity, we
only considered the topological and causal structure of space-time as well as spinors
and wave functions. The reader interested in geometric structures like connection
and curvature is referred to the detailed exposition in [14]. Moreover, in Sect. 5
below we shall explain how the methods and results introduced in this section can
be generalized to interacting systems.
3
Underlying Physical Principles
In order to clarify the physical concepts, we now brieﬂy discuss the underlying
physical principles. Causal fermion systems evolved from an attempt to combine
several physical principles in a coherent mathematical framework. As a result, these
principles appear in the framework in a speciﬁc way:
I The principle of causality is built into a causal fermion system in a speciﬁc way,
as was explained in Sect. 1.2 above.
I The Pauli exclusion principle is incorporated in a causal fermion system, as can
be seen in various ways. One formulation of the Pauli exclusion principle states
that every fermionic one-particle state can be occupied by at most one particle.
In this formulation, the Pauli exclusion principle is respected because every
wave function can either be represented in the form  u (the state is occupied)
with u 2 H or it cannot be represented as a physical wave function (the state
is not occupied). Via these two conditions, the fermionic projector encodes for
every state the occupation numbers 1 and 0, respectively, but it is impossible

356
F. Finster
to describe higher occupation numbers. More technically, one may obtain the
connection to the fermionic Fock space formalism by choosing an orthonormal
basis u1; : : : ; uf of H and forming the f-particle Hartree-Fock state
‰ WD  u1 ^    ^  uf :
Clearly, the choice of the orthonormal basis is unique only up to the unitary
transformations
ui ! Qui D
fX
jD1
Uij uj
with
U 2 U. f/ :
Due to the anti-symmetrization, this transformation changes the corresponding
Hartree-Fock state only by an irrelevant phase factor,
 Qu1 ^    ^  Quf D det U  u1 ^    ^  uf :
Thus the conﬁguration of the physical wave functions can be described by a
fermionic multi-particle wave function. The Pauli exclusion principle becomes
apparent in the total anti-symmetrization of this wave function.
I A local gauge principle becomes apparent once we choose basis representations
of the spin spaces and write the wave functions in components. Denoting
the signature of .Sx; :j:x/ by . p.x/; q.x//, we choose a pseudo-orthonormal
basis .e˛.x//˛D1;:::;pCq of Sx. Then a wave function  can be represented as
 .x/ D
pCq
X
˛D1
 ˛.x/ e˛.x/
with component functions  1; : : : ;  pCq. The freedom in choosing the basis .e˛/
is described by the group U. p; q/ of unitary transformations with respect to an
inner product of signature . p; q/. This gives rise to the transformations
e˛.x/ !
pCq
X
ˇD1
U1.x/ˇ
˛ eˇ.x/
and
 ˛.x/ !
pCq
X
ˇD1
U.x/˛
ˇ  ˇ.x/
with U 2 U. p; q/. As the basis .e˛/ can be chosen independently at each space-
time point, one obtains local gauge transformations of the wave functions, where
the gauge group is determined to be the isometry group of the spin scalar product.
The causal action is gauge invariant in the sense that it does not depend on the
choice of spinor bases.
I The equivalence principle is incorporated in the following general way. Space-
time M WD supp  together with the universal measure  form a topological
measure space, being a more general structure than a Lorentzian manifold.
Therefore, when describing M by local coordinates, the freedom in choosing

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
357
such coordinates generalizes the freedom in choosing general reference frames in
a space-time manifold. Therefore, the equivalence principle of general relativity
is respected. The causal action is generally covariant in the sense that it does not
depend on the choice of coordinates.
4
The Dynamics of Causal Fermion Systems
Similar to the Einstein-Hilbert action in general relativity, in the causal action
principle one varies space-time as well as all structures therein globally. This global
viewpoint implies that it is not obvious what the causal action principle tells us about
the dynamics of the system. The ﬁrst step for clarifying the situation is to derive
the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations corresponding to the causal action principle
(Sect. 4.1). Similar to the Einstein or Maxwell equations, these EL equations
should describe the dynamics. Additional insight is gained by studying Noether-
like theorems which specify the quantities which are conserved in the dynamics
(Sect. 4.2). Finally, we review results on the initial value problem (Sect. 4.3). We
remark that more explicit information on the dynamics is obtained by considering
limiting cases in which the EL equations corresponding to the causal action reduce
to equations of a structure familiar from classical ﬁeld theory and quantum ﬁeld
theory (see Sect. 5).
4.1
The Euler-Lagrange Equations
We now return to the abstract setting of Sect. 1. Our goal is to derive the EL
equations corresponding to the causal action principle in the form most useful for
our purposes. The method is to consider so-called variations of the physical wave
functions which we now introduce (for more general variations see Remark 4.3
below). Let .H; F; / be a causal fermion system. We assume that  is a minimizer
of the causal action principle. However, we do not want to assume that the total
volume .F/ be ﬁnite. Instead, we merely assume that  is locally ﬁnite in the sense
that .K/ < 1 for every compact subset K  F. Our starting point is the wave
evaluation operator ‰ introduced in (18),
‰ W H ! C0.M; SM/ ;
u 7!  u :
We now vary the wave evaluation operator. Thus for any  2 .ı; ı/ we consider a
mapping ‰ W H ! C0.M/. For  D 0, this mapping should coincide with the wave
evaluation operator ‰. The family .‰/2.ı;ı/ can be regarded as a simultaneous
variation of all physical wave functions of the system. In fact, for any u 2 H, the
variation of the corresponding physical wave function is given by
 u
 WD ‰.u/ 2 C0.M; SM/ :

358
F. Finster
Next, we introduce the corresponding local correlation operators F by
F.x/ WD ‰.x/‰.x/
so that
F W M ! F :
In view of (19), we know that F0.x/ D x. Therefore, the family .F/2.ı;ı/ is a
variation of the local correlation operators. Taking the push-forward measure gives
rise to a family of universal measures,
 WD .F/ :
(64)
Since F0 is the identity, we know that 0 D . Therefore, the family ./2.ı;ı/ is
indeed a variation of the universal measure.
We now work out the EL equations for the resulting class of variations of the
universal measure. In order for the constructions to be mathematically well-deﬁned,
we need a few technical assumptions which are summarized in the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.1 The variation of the physical wave functions is smooth and
compact if the family of operators .‰/2.ı;ı/ has the following properties:
(a) The variation is trivial on the orthogonal complement of a ﬁnite-dimensional
subspace I  H, i.e.
‰jI? D ‰
for all  2 .ı; ı/ :
(b) There is a compact subset K  M outside which the variation is trivial, i.e.

‰.u/

for all  2 .ı; ı/ and u 2 H :
(c) The Lagrangian is continuously differentiable in the sense that the derivative
d



(65)
exists and is continuous on M  M.
With the conditions (a) and (b) we restrict attention to variations which are
sufﬁciently well-behaved (similar as in the classical calculus of variations, where
one restricts attention to smooth and compactly supported variations). It is a delicate
point to satisfy the condition (c), because (due to the absolute values of the
eigenvalues in (1)) the Lagrangian is only Lipschitz continuous on FF. Therefore,
the derivative in (65) does not need to exist, even if F.y/ is smooth. This means that
in the applications, one must verify that the condition (c) holds (for details see the
computations in [6]). Here we simply assume that the variation of the wave functions
is smooth and compact.

(and similarly for the other integrals). Another beneﬁt of working with the push-
forward measure (64) is that the total volume is preserved. Namely, combining the
identity (66) with the assumption in Deﬁnition 4.1(b), one readily veriﬁes that the
volume constraint (3) is satisﬁed in the sense that  satisﬁes the conditions (7).
We consider ﬁrst variations, treating the constraints with Lagrange multipliers
(this procedure is justiﬁed in [1]). Since the volume constraint is already respected,
it remains to consider the trace constraint (4) and the boundedness constraint (5).
We conclude that ﬁrst variations of the functional

constants C and c are the prescribed values of the constraints. For clarity, we
point out that the boundedness constraint merely is an inequality. The method for
handling this inequality constraint is to choose  D 0 if T ./ < C, whereas in the
case T ./ D C the Lagrange multiplier  is in general non-zero (for details see
again [1]). Introducing the short notation

Now we can compute the ﬁrst variation by differentiating with respect to . It
is most convenient to express the causal action and the constraints in terms of the
kernel of the fermionic projector (just as explained at the beginning of Sect. 1.3).
Moreover, it is preferable to consider the Lagrangian L.x; y/ as a function only
of P.x; y/ by writing the closed chain as
Axy D P.x; y/ P.x; y/
(68)

360
F. Finster
(where P.x; y/ denotes similar to (13) the adjoint with respect to the spin scalar
product). We use the notation
ıP.x; y/ D d
d P.x; y/
ˇˇˇ
D0 ;
and similarly for other functions. When computing the variation of the Lagrangian,
one must keep in mind that L.x; y/ depends both on P.x; y/ and on its ad-
joint P.x; y/ (cf. (68)). Therefore, when applying the chain rule, we obtain
contributions which are complex linear and complex anti-linear in ıP.x; y/. We
write the ﬁrst variation with traces as
ıL.x; y/ D TrSy

B ıP.x; y/


C ıP.x; y/
with linear operators B W Sx ! Sy and C W Sy ! Sx. Since ıP.x; y/ can be chosen
arbitrarily, this equation uniquely deﬁnes both B and C. Since the variation of the
Lagrangian is always real-valued, it follows that C D B. Using furthermore the
symmetry of the Lagrangian in the arguments x and y, we conclude that the ﬁrst
variation of the Lagrangian can be written as (see also [8, Section 5.2])

Proposition 4.2 (Euler-Lagrange equations) Let  be a minimizer of the causal

We remark that the kernel Q.x; y/ also gives rise to an operator on the one-particle

that the operator Q is symmetric on the Krein space .K; <:j:>/. Equation (71) can

(73)
(where ‰ is again the wave evaluation operator (18)). In words, this equation
means that the operator .2Q  / vanishes on the physical wave functions.
However, the operator equation (73) is not satisfying mathematically because the
physical wave functions in the image of ‰ are in general not vectors of the Krein
space .K; <:j:>/ (see Sect. 1.5). Nevertheless, (73) is useful as a short notation for
the EL equations (71).
Remark 4.3 (more general variations) Clearly, only a special class of variations of
the universal measure can be described by variations of the physical wave functions.
As a consequence, the resulting EL equations (71) are only necessary conditions
for  to be a critical point of the action (67). We now explain how these necessary
conditions are related to the stronger EL equations as derived in [1].
As an example of variations which are not covered by the ansatz (64), one can
multiply the universal measure by weight functions
d D f d ;
(74)
where .f/2.ı;ı/ is a family of non-negative functions which are integrable and

Computing ﬁrst variations of the action (67) gives rise to the equation

This is an additional EL equation which minimizers of the causal action principle
must satisfy. It turns out that in the limiting case of an interacting system in
Minkowski space (to be discussed in Sects. 5.2 and 5.3 below), this equation can
be satisﬁed simply by a rescaling of the local correlation operators.
Variations of the physical wave functions as well as variations of the form (74)
have the property that the support of the universal measure changes continuously
(in the sense that for every compact set K  F and every open neighborhood U
of K \ supp  there is " > 0 such that supp  \ K  U for all  with jj < "). Such
variations can be regarded as the analogs of variations of the potentials, the metric
or the wave functions in classical ﬁeld theory or quantum mechanics. However, in
the setting of causal fermion systems there are also more general smooth variations
for which the support of the measure  changes discontinuously. A typical example

is to let  be a bounded measure and to set
 D .1  2/  C 2 .F/ ıx ;
(76)
where ıx is the Dirac measure supported at x 62
supp . The EL equations
corresponding to such variations have a different mathematical structure, which
we cannot explain in detail here. Generally speaking, for interacting systems in
Minkowski space, the EL equations of Proposition 4.2 give rise to an effective in-
teraction via classical gauge ﬁelds (this so-called continuum limit will be discussed
in Sect. 5.2). The EL equations corresponding to more general variations like (76),
however, give rise to an effective interaction via bosonic quantum ﬁelds. We will
come back to this point in Sect. 5.3.

4.2
Symmetries and Conserved Surface Layer Integrals
In [20] it is shown that symmetries of the Lagrangian give rise to conservation laws.
These results can be understood as adaptations of Noether’s theorem to the causal
action principle. Since the mathematical structure of the causal action principle is
quite different from that of the Lagrangian formulation of classical ﬁeld theory,
these adaptations are not straightforward. We now explain a few concepts and results
from [20] which are important for understanding the general physical picture.
We ﬁrst recall that the conservation laws obtained from the classical Noether
theorem state that the integral of a certain density over a Cauchy surface N does
not depend on the choice of N. For example, charge conservation states that the
spatial integral of the charge density gives a constant. As another example, energy
conservation states that in a static space-time background, the integral of the energy
density is a constant. In general terms, the conserved quantities are spatial integrals
over a Cauchy surface N (see the left of Fig. 1). In the setting of causal fermion
systems, it is unclear how such surface integrals should be deﬁned, in particular
because we do not have a measure on hypersurfaces and because it is not clear
what the normal  on the hypersurface should be. This is the reason why in the
Noether-like theorems in [20] one works instead of surface integrals with so-called
Fig. 1 A surface integral and a corresponding surface layer integral

364
F. Finster
surface layer integrals where one integrates over a boundary layer of a set   M
(see the right of Fig. 1). The width ı of this layer is the length scale on which L.x; y/
decays. For a system composed of Dirac particles (similar as explained in Sect. 2 for
the Minkowski vacuum and in Sect. 5.2 for interacting systems), this length scale
can be identiﬁed with the Compton scale  m1 of the Dirac particles. Thus the
width of the surface layer is a non-zero macroscopic length scale. In particular, the
surface layer integrals cannot be identiﬁed with or considered as a generalization of
the surface integrals of the classical Noether theorem. However, in most situations
of interest, when the surface N is almost ﬂat on the Compton scale (like for a
spatial hyperplane in Minkowski space), the surface layer integral can be well-
approximated by a corresponding surface integral. It turns out that in this limiting
case, the conservation laws obtained from the Noether-like theorems in [20] go over
to corresponding classical conservation laws.
From the conceptual point of view, the most interesting conservation law is
charge conservation. In order to construct the underlying symmetry, we let A be
a bounded symmetric operator on H and let
U WD exp.iA/
be the corresponding one-parameter family of unitary transformations. We introduce
the family of transformations
ˆ W F ! F ;
ˆ.x/ D U x U1

:
Since the Lagrangian is deﬁned via the spectrum of operators on H, it clearly
remains unchanged if all operators are unitarily transformed, i.e.
L

ˆ.x/; ˆ.y/

D L.x; y/ :
(77)
In other words, the transformations ˆ describe a symmetry of the Lagrangian. Next,
one constructs a corresponding one-family of universal measures by taking the push-
forward,
 WD .ˆ/ :
As a consequence of the symmetry (77), this variation of the universal measure
leaves the action invariant. Under suitable differentiability assumptions, this sym-

end, for simplicity we consider a system in Minkowski space (similar as explained

for the vacuum in Sect. 2) and choose a sequence of compact sets n which exhaust
the region between two Cauchy surfaces at times t D t0 and t D t1. Then the
surface layer integral (78) reduces to the difference of integrals over surface layers
at times t  t0 and t  t1. Next, we choose A D hui as the projection operator on
the one-dimensional subspace generated by a vector u 2 H. Then in the limit " & 0
in which the UV regularization is removed, the resulting surface layer integral at
time t  t0 reduces to the integral
Z
R3 u.t0; Ex/ j 0u.t0; Ex/.t0;Ex/ d3x ;
thereby reproducing the probability integral in Dirac theory. As a consequence, the
representation of the scalar product h:j:iH as an integral over a Cauchy surface (26)
has a natural generalization to the setting of causal fermion systems, if the surface
integral is replaced by a corresponding surface layer integral. This result also
shows that the spatial normalization of the fermionic projector (where one works
with spatial integrals of the form (47); for details see [28]) really is the correct
normalization method which reﬂects the intrinsic conservation laws of the causal
fermion system.
The conservation laws in [20] also give rise to the conservation of energy and
momentum, as we now outline. In the classical Noether theorem, these conservation
laws are a consequence of space-time symmetries as described most conveniently
using the notion of Killing ﬁelds. Therefore, one must extend this notion to the
setting of causal fermion systems. Before explaining how this can be accomplished,
we recall the procedure in the classical Noether theorem: In the notion of a Killing
ﬁeld, one distinguishes the background geometry from the additional particles and
ﬁelds. The background geometry must have a symmetry as described by the Killing
equation. The additional particles and ﬁelds, however, do not need to have any
symmetries. Nevertheless, one can construct a symmetry of the whole system by
actively transporting the particles and ﬁelds along the ﬂow lines of the Killing ﬁeld.
The conservation law corresponding to this symmetry transformation gives rise to
the conservation of energy and momentum.
In a causal fermion system, there is no clear-cut distinction between the
background geometry and the particles and ﬁelds of the system, because all of these
structures are encoded in the underlying causal fermion system and mutually depend
on each other. Therefore, instead of working with a symmetry of the background
geometry, we work with the notion of an approximate symmetry. By actively
transforming those physical wave functions which do not respect the symmetry, such
an approximate symmetry again gives rise to an exact symmetry transformation, to
which the Noether-like theorems in [20] can be applied. More precisely, one begins
with a C1-family of transformations .f/2.ı;ı/ of space-time,
f W M ! M
with
f0 D
 ;
(79)
which preserve the universal measure in the sense that .f/ D . The family .f/
can be regarded as the analog of a ﬂow in space-time along a classical Killing ﬁeld.

366
F. Finster
Moreover, one considers a family of unitary transformations .U/2.ı;ı/ on H with
the property that
U U D

for all  2 .ı; ı/ :
Combining these transformations should give rise to an approximate symmetry of
the wave evaluation operator (18) in the sense that if we compare the transformation
of the space-time point with the unitary transformation by setting


f.x/

 .‰U1
 u/.x/
.x 2 M; u 2 H/ ;
(80)
then the operator E
W H ! C0.M; SM/ should be sufﬁciently small. Here
“small” means for example that E vanishes on the orthogonal complement of a
ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of H; for details see [20, Section 6]. Introducing the
variation ˆ by
ˆ W M ! F ;
ˆ.x/ D U x U1

;
we again obtain a symmetry of the Lagrangian (77). This gives rise to conserved
surface layer integrals of the form (78). In order to bring these surface layer integrals
into a computable form, one decomposes the ﬁrst variation of ˆ as
ıˆ.x/ WD @ˆ.x/
ˇˇ
D0 D ıf.x/ C v.x/ ;
(81)
where ıf is the ﬁrst variation of f, (79), and v.x/ is a vector ﬁeld on F along M
which is transversal to M  F. Expressing v in terms of the operator E in (80) shows
that v is again small, making it possible to compute the corresponding variation of
the Lagrangian in (78). We remark that in the decomposition (81), the vector ﬁeld ıf
describes a transformation of the space-time points. The vector ﬁeld v, however,
can be understood as an active transformation of all the objects in space-time which
do not have the space-time symmetry (similar as described above for the parallel
transport of the particles and ﬁelds along the ﬂow lines of the Killing ﬁeld in the
classical Noether theorem).
In order to get the connection to classical conservation laws, one again studies
a system in Minkowski space and considers the limiting case where a sequence n
exhausts the region between two Cauchy surfaces at times t D t0 and t D t1. In this
limiting case, the conserved surface layer integral reduces to the surface integral
Z
R3 Ti0 Ki d3x ;
where Tij is the energy-momentum tensor of the Dirac particles and K D ıf is
a Killing ﬁeld. This shows that the conservation of energy and momentum is a
special case of more general conservation laws which are intrinsic to causal fermion
systems.

The Initial Value Problem and Time Evolution
In order to get a better understanding of the dynamics described by the causal action
principle, it is an important task to analyze the initial value problem. The obvious
questions are: What is the initial data? Is it clear that a solution exists? Is the solution
unique? How do solutions look like? Giving general answers to these questions is a
difﬁcult mathematical problem. In order to evaluate the difﬁculties, one should recall
that  describes space-time as well as all structures therein. Therefore, similar as in
the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations, solving the initial value problem
involves ﬁnding the geometry of space-time together with the dynamics of all
particles and ﬁelds. In view of the complexity of this problem, the only results
known at present are contained in the paper [15], where an initial value problem
is formulated and some existence and uniqueness theorems are proven. We now
review a few methods and results of this paper. Moreover, at the end of this section
we mention an approach proposed in [19] for obtaining more explicit information
on the dynamics by analyzing perturbations of a given minimizing measure.
Since the analysis of the causal action principle is technically demanding, in [15]
one considers instead so-called causal variational principles in the compact setting.
In order to get into this simpliﬁed setting, one replaces F by a compact metric space
(or a smooth manifold). The Lagrangian is replaced by a non-negative continuous
function L 2 C0;1.F  F; RC
0 / which is symmetric in its two arguments. Similar
to (2) one minimizes the action
S./ D
“
FF
L.x; y/ d.x/ d.y/
in the class of all normalized regular Borel measures on F, but now leaving out the
constraints (4) and (5). Space-time is again deﬁned by M WD supp . The resulting
causal structure is deﬁned by saying that two space-time points x; y 2 M are called
timelike separated if L.x; y/ > 0, and spacelike separated if L.x; y/ D 0. Clearly, in
this setting there are no wave functions. Nevertheless, causal variational principles
in the compact setting incorporate basic features of the causal action principle and
are therefore a good starting point for the analysis (for a more detailed introduction
and structural results on the minimizing measures see [26]).
When solving the classical Cauchy problem, instead of searching for a global
solution, it is often easier to look for a local solution around a given initial value
surface. This concept of a local solution also reﬂects the common physical situation
where the physical system under consideration is only a small subsystem of the
whole universe. With this in mind, we would like to “localize” the variational
principle to a subset I  F, referred to as the inner region. There is the complication
that the Lagrangian L.x; y/ is nonlocal in the sense that it may be non-zero for
points x 2 I and y 2 FnI. In order to take this effect into account, one describes the
inﬂuence of the “outer region” F n I by a so-called external potential  W F ! RC
0 .
In the limiting case when the outer region becomes large, this gives rise to the so-

368
F. Finster
called inner variational principle, where the action deﬁned by

(82)
is minimized under variations of  in the class of regular Borel measures on I (not
necessarily normalized because the volume constraint is now taken care of by the
corresponding Lagrange parameter s > 0).
The initial values are described by a regular Borel measure 0 (which is to be
thought of as the universal measure restricted to a time slice around the initial value
surface in space-time). The initial conditions are implemented by demanding that
  0 :
(83)
The naive method of minimizing (82) under the constraint (83) is not a sensible
concept because the constraint (83) would give rise to undesirable Lagrange mul-
tiplier terms in the EL equations. Instead, one minimizes (82) without constraints,
but chooses the external potential  in such a way that the minimizing measure
satisﬁes the initial values (83). It turns out that this procedure does not determine
the external potential uniquely. Therefore, the method proposed in [15] is to optimize
the external potential by making it in a suitable sense “small.” As is made precise
in [15] in various situations, the resulting interplay between minimizing the action
and optimizing the external potential gives rise to unique solutions of the initial-
value problem with an optimal external potential.
We point out that, due to the mathematical simpliﬁcations made, the results
in [15] do not apply to physically interesting situations like the initial value problem
for interacting Dirac sea conﬁgurations. Moreover, the methods in [15] do not seem
to give explicit information on the dynamics of causal fermion systems. Therefore,
it is a promising complementary approach to consider perturbations of a given
minimizing measure (which should describe the “vacuum conﬁguration”) and to
analyze the dynamics of the perturbations by studying the resulting EL equations.
This approach is pursued in [19] in the following way. In order to describe the
perturbations of the minimizing measure , one considers smooth variations for
which the support of  changes continuously. Combining (64) and (74), these
variations can be written as
Q D .F/
f 
with a family of mappings F W M ! F and a family of non-negative functions f.
Expanding in powers of , these variations can be described conveniently in terms
of sections of jet bundles over M. The EL equations yield conditions on the jets,
which can be rewritten as dynamical equations in space-time.

Limiting Cases
We now discuss different limiting cases of causal fermion systems.
5.1
The Quasi-free Dirac Field and Hadamard States
We now turn attention to interacting systems. The simplest interaction is obtained
by inserting an external potential into the Dirac equation (25),

Another situation of physical interest is to consider the Dirac equation in an external
classical gravitational ﬁeld as described mathematically by a globally hyperbolic
Lorentzian manifold .M; g/. In this section, we explain how the methods and results
of Sect. 2 generalize to the situation when an external ﬁeld is present. This will
also give a connection to quasi-free Dirac ﬁelds and Hadamard states. In order to
keep the explanations as simple as possible, we here restrict attention to an external
potential B in Minkowski space, but remark that many methods and results could or
have been worked out also in the presence of a gravitational ﬁeld.
The obvious conceptual difﬁculty when extending the constructions of Sect. 2 is
that one no longer has the notion of “negative-frequency solutions” which were
essential for introducing Dirac sea conﬁgurations (see Lemma 2.8). In order to
overcome this difﬁculty, one needs to decompose the solution space of the Dirac
equation (84) into two subspace, in such a way that without external potential the
two subspaces reduce to the subspaces of positive and negative frequency. This
external ﬁeld problem was solved perturbatively in [7, 16] and non-perturbatively
in [23–25] (for a more detailed exposition see [8, §2.1]).
We now brieﬂy outline the non-perturbative treatment, which relies on the con-
struction on the so-called fermionic signature operator. Choosing again the scalar
product (26), the solution space of the Dirac equation (84) forms a Hilbert space
denoted by .Hm; .:j:/m/. Moreover, on the Dirac wave functions (not necessarily
solutions of the Dirac equations) one may introduce a dual pairing by integrating
the spin scalar product over all of space-time,

(85)
The basic idea is to extend this dual pairing to a bilinear form on the Hilbert
space Hm and to represent this bilinear form in terms of the Hilbert space scalar
product

If M is a space-time of ﬁnite lifetime, this construction can indeed be carried out
and deﬁnes the fermionic signature operator S being a bounded symmetric operator
on Hm (see [25]). The positive and negative spectral subspaces of S give the desired
decomposition of Hm into two subspaces. We remark that the fermionic signature
operator makes it possible to study spectral geometry for Lorentzian signature
(see [22] and [12] for the connection to index theory).
In space-times of inﬁnite lifetime like Minkowski space, the above method does
not work because (85) does not extend to a continuous bilinear form on Hm  Hm.
The underlying problem is that the time integral in (85) in general diverges for
solutions of the Dirac equation. In order to circumvent this problem, one considers
families of Dirac solutions . m/m2I (for an open interval I D .ma; mb/  .0; 1/)
and makes use of the fact that integrating over the mass parameter generates decay
of the wave functions for large times (for details see [24]). As a result, one can make
sense of the equation
<

which uniquely deﬁnes a family of bounded symmetric operators .Sm/m2I. Now the
positive and negative spectral subspaces of the operator Sm again give the desired
decomposition of Hm into two subspaces.
Having decomposed the solution space, one may choose the Hilbert space H
of the causal fermion system as one of the two subspaces of the solution space.
Choosing an orthonormal basis .u`/ of H and introducing the unregularized kernel
of the fermionic projector again by (43), one obtains a two-point distribution P.x; y/.
Using that this two-point distribution comes from a projection operator in the Hilbert
space Hm, there is a canonical construction which gives a quasi-free Dirac ﬁeld
together with a Fock representation such that the two-point distribution coincides
with P.x; y/. In the language of algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory, this result is stated
as follows (see [23, Theorem 1.4]):
Theorem 5.1 There is an algebra of smeared ﬁelds generated by ‰.g/, ‰. f/
together with a quasi-free state ! with the following properties:
(a) The canonical anti-commutation relations hold:

This theorem means that before introducing an UV regularization, the description
of the Dirac system using the fermionic projector is equivalent to the usual
description of a quasi-free Dirac ﬁeld in quantum ﬁeld theory.

Moreover, it is shown in [23] that the two-point distribution P.x; y/ is of
Hadamard form, provided that B is smooth, not too large and decays faster than
quadratically for large times (for details see [23, Theorem 1.3] and the references in
this paper). This result implies that the representation of the quasi-free Dirac ﬁeld as
obtained from the fermionic projector is a suitable starting point for a perturbative
treatment of the resulting interacting theory (see for example [4]).
In our context, the fact that P.x; y/ is of Hadamard form implies that the
results in Sect. 1.2 also apply in the presence of an external potential, as we now
explain. The Hadamard property means in words that the bi-distribution P.x; y/ in
the presence of the external potential has the same singularity structure as in the
Minkowski vacuum. As a consequence, the arguments in Sect. 1.2 remain true if
the points x and y are sufﬁciently close to each other. More precisely, the relevant
length scale is given by the inverse of the amplitude jB.x/j1 of the external
potential. On the other hand, the separation of the points x and y must be larger than
the scale " on which regularization effects come into play. Therefore, the causal
structure of a causal fermion system agrees with that of Minkowski space on the
scale "

 jBj1 (where jBj is any matrix norm). Thinking
of " as being at least as small as the Planck length, in most situations of interest the
lower bound is no restriction. The upper bound is also unproblematic because the
causal structure on the macroscopic scale can still be recovered by considering paths
in space-time and subdividing the path on a scale ı 
 jBj1 (similar as explained
in [14, Section 4.4] for the spin connection). With this in mind, we conclude that the
causal structure of a causal fermion system indeed agrees with that of Minkowski
space, even in the presence of an external potential.
5.2
Effective Interaction via Classical Gauge Fields
We now outline how to describe interacting systems in Minkowski space by
analyzing the EL equations corresponding to the causal action principle as worked
out in Proposition 4.2. In this so-called continuum limit the interaction is described
by classical gauge ﬁelds. For brevity, we can only explain a few basic concepts and
refer the interested reader to the detailed computations in the book [6].
Let us begin with the Minkowski vacuum. As shown in Sect. 2.2, regularizing a
vacuum Dirac sea conﬁguration gives rise to a causal fermion system .H; F; "/.
Moreover, we saw in the following Sects. 2.3 and 2.4 that the inherent structures
of the causal fermion system can be identiﬁed with those of Minkowski space (in
particular, see (37) as well as Propositions 2.6 and 2.7). This makes it possible to
write the EL equations (71) as

F. Finster
where the regularized kernel Q".x; y/ is again deﬁned via (69) as the derivative of
the Lagrangian. Next, one chooses the Hilbert space H as in Sect. 2.5 as the Dirac
sea conﬁguration formed of all negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation.
Then P".x; y/ can be computed explicitly by regularizing the distribution P.x; y/
as given in momentum space by (46) and in position space by (48) and Lemma 2.9.
Computing Q".x; y/, it turns out that the EL equations are mathematically well-
deﬁned if the convolution integral in (86) is rewritten with the help of Plancherel’s
theorem as a multiplication in momentum space. The analysis of the continuum limit
gives a procedure for studying these equations in the asymptotics " & 0 when the
regularization is removed. The effective equations obtained in this asymptotic limit
are evaluated most conveniently in a formalism in which the unknown microscopic
structure of space-time (as described by the regularization) enters only in terms of
a ﬁnite (typically small) number of so-called regularization parameters. According
to the method of variable regularization (see Remark 2.1), one needs to analyze the
dependence of the regularization parameters in detail. It turns out that the causal
fermion systems obtained from the vacuum Dirac sea conﬁguration satisfy the EL
equations in the continuum limit, for any choice of the regularization parameters.
The ﬁrst step towards interacting systems is to consider systems involving
particles and/or anti-particles. To this end, one simply modiﬁes the constructions
in Sect. 2.5 by choosing the Hilbert space H differently. Namely, instead of choosing
all negative-energy solutions, one chooses H as a subspace of the solution space
which differs from the space of all negative-energy solutions by a ﬁnite-dimensional
subspace. In other words, H is obtained from the space of all negative-energy
solutions by taking out a ﬁnite number na of states and by adding a ﬁnite number of
states np of positive energy. Thus, denoting the regularized kernel of the fermionic
projector of the Minkowski vacuum for clarity by P"
sea.x; y/, the kernel of the
fermionic projector (42) can be written as
P".x; y/ D P"

(87)
where  k and l are suitably normalized bases of the particle and anti-particle
states, respectively. In this procedure, we again take Dirac’s concept of a “sea” of
particles literally and describe particles and anti-particles by occupying positive-
energy states and creating “holes” in the Dirac sea, respectively. We also remark that
the construction (87) modiﬁes the kernel of the fermionic projector only by smooth
contributions and thus preserves the singularity structure of P".x; y/ as " & 0. As
a consequence, the correspondence of the inherent structures of the causal fermion
systems to the structures in Minkowski space remains unchanged (just as explained
at the end of Sect. 5.1 for an external potential).
According to (87), the particle and anti-particle states modify the kernel of the
fermionic projector. It turns out that this has the effect that the EL equations in the

Causal Fermion Systems: An Overview
373
continuum limit no longer hold. In order to again satisfy these equations, we need
to introduce an interaction. In mathematical terms, this means that the universal
measure  must be modiﬁed. The basic question is how to modify the universal
measure in such a way that the EL equations in the continuum limit again hold. It
turns out that it is a useful ﬁrst step to insert an external potential B into the Dirac
equation (25) by going over to the Dirac equation (84). Choosing H as a subspace
of the solution space of this Dirac equation, the constructions of Sect. 2 again apply
and give rise to causal fermion systems .H; F; "/. The potential B modiﬁes the
dynamics of all physical wave functions in a collective way. Now one can ask the
question whether the resulting causal fermion systems satisfy the EL equations in
the continuum limit. It turns out that this is the case if and only if the potential B
satisﬁes certain equations, which can be identiﬁed with classical ﬁeld equations for
the potential B. In this way, the causal action principle gives rise to classical ﬁeld
equations. In order to make our concepts clear, we point out that the potential B
merely is a convenient device in order to describe the collective behavior of all
physical wave functions. It should not be considered as a fundamental object of
the theory. We also note that, in order to describe variations of the physical wave
functions, the potential in (84) can be chosen arbitrarily (in particular, the potential
does not need to satisfy any ﬁeld equations). Each choice of B describes a different
variation of the physical wave functions. It is the EL equations in the continuum
limit which single out the physically admissible potentials as being those which
satisfy the ﬁeld equations.
Before going on, we brieﬂy explain how the subspace H is chosen. Clearly,
the Dirac equation (84) cannot in general be solved in closed form. Therefore,
for an explicit analysis one must use perturbative methods. When performing the
perturbation expansion, one must be careful about the proper normalization of the
fermionic states (in the sense that spatial integrals of the form (47) should be
preserved). Moreover, one must make sure that the singular structure of P.x; y/
in position space is compatible with the causal action principle (meaning that
the light-cone expansion of P.x; y/ only involves bounded integrals of B and its
derivatives). Satisfying these two requirements leads to the causal perturbation
expansion (see [28] and the references therein). We also mention that regularizing
the perturbation expansion is a delicate issue. This can already be understood for
the simple regularization by molliﬁcation in Example 2.4, in which case it is not
clear whether one should ﬁrst mollify and then introduce the interaction or vice
versa. The correct method for regularizing the perturbation expansion is obtained
by demanding that the behavior under gauge transformations should be preserved
by the regularization. This leads to the regularized causal perturbation expansion
as developed in [8, Appendix D] and [6, Appendix F].
We proceed with a brief overview of the results of the analysis of the continuum
limit. In [6] the continuum limit is worked out in several steps beginning from
simple systems and ending with a system realizing the fermion conﬁguration of the
standard model. For each of these systems, the continuum limit gives rise to effective
equations for second-quantized fermion ﬁelds coupled to classical bosonic gauge
ﬁelds (for the connection to second-quantized bosonic ﬁelds see Sect. 5.3 below).

374
F. Finster
To explain the structure of the obtained results, it is preferable to ﬁrst describe
the system modelling the leptons as analyzed in [6, Chapter 4]. The input to this
model is the conﬁguration of the leptons in the standard model without interaction.
Thus the fermionic projector of the vacuum is assumed to be composed of three
generations of Dirac particles of masses m1; m2; m3 > 0 (describing e, 	, ) as
well as three generations of Dirac particles of masses Qm1; Qm2; Qm3  0 (describing
the corresponding neutrinos). Furthermore, we assume that the regularization of the
neutrinos breaks the chiral symmetry (implying that we only see their left-handed
components). We point out that the deﬁnition of the model does not involve any
assumptions on the interaction.
The detailed analysis in [6, Chapter 4] reveals that the effective interaction in the
continuum limit has the following structure. The fermions satisfy the Dirac equation
coupled to a left-handed SU.2/-gauge potential AL D

valid for ˛ D 1; 2; 3 (for notational simplicity, we wrote the Dirac current for one

the expectation value of the corresponding fermionic ﬁeld operators). Here M˛ are
the bosonic masses and c˛ the corresponding coupling constants. The masses and
coupling constants of the two off-diagonal components are equal, i.e. M1 D M2
and c1 D c2, but they may be different from the mass and coupling constant of the
diagonal component ˛ D 3. Generally speaking, the mass ratios M1=m1, M3=m1
as well as the coupling constants c1, c3 depend on the regularization. For a given
regularization, they are computable.
Finally, our model involves a gravitational ﬁeld described by the Einstein
equations

where Rjk denotes the Ricci tensor, R is scalar curvature, and Tjk is the energy-
momentum tensor of the Dirac ﬁeld. Moreover,  and ƒ denote the gravitational
and the cosmological constants, respectively. We ﬁnd that the gravitational constant
scales like   ı2, where ı  " is the length scale on which the chiral symmetry
is broken.
In [6, Chapter 5] a system is analyzed which realizes the conﬁguration of the
leptons and quarks in the standard model. The result is that the ﬁeld equation (89)
is replaced by ﬁeld equations for the electroweak and strong interactions after
spontaneous symmetry breaking (the dynamics of the corresponding Higgs ﬁeld
has not yet been analyzed). Furthermore, the system again involves gravity (90).
A few clarifying remarks are in order. First, the above ﬁeld equations come
with corrections which for brevity we cannot discuss here (see [6, Sections 3.8,
4.4 and 4.6]). Next, it is worth noting that, although the states of the Dirac sea are
explicitly taken into account in our analysis, they do not enter the ﬁeld equations.
More speciﬁcally, in a perturbative treatment, the divergences of the Feynman
diagram describing the vacuum polarization drop out of the EL equations of the
causal action. Similarly, the naive “inﬁnite negative energy density” of the sea
drops out of the Einstein equations, making it unnecessary to subtract any counter
terms. We ﬁnally remark that the only free parameters of the theory are the masses
in (88) as well as the parameter ı which determines the gravitational constant. The
coupling constants, the bosonic masses and the mixing matrices are functions of the
regularization parameters which are unknown due to our present lack of knowledge
on the microscopic structure of space-time. The regularization parameters cannot be
chosen arbitrarily because they must satisfy certain relations. But except for these
constraints, the regularization parameters are currently treated as free empirical
parameters.
To summarize, the dynamics in the continuum limit is described by Dirac spinors
coupled to classical gauge ﬁelds and gravity. The effective continuum theory is
manifestly covariant under general coordinate transformations. The only limitation
of the continuum limit is that the bosonic ﬁelds are merely classical. We shall come
back to second-quantized bosonic ﬁelds in Sect. 5.3 below.
5.3
Effective Interaction via Bosonic Quantum Fields
In Sect. 5.2 it was outlined that and in which sense the regularized Dirac sea
vacuum satisﬁes the EL equations (71). In simple terms, these results mean that
the regularized Dirac sea vacuum is a critical point of the causal action under
variations of the physical wave functions (see Deﬁnition 4.1). We now explain why
the regularized Dirac sea vacuum is not a minimizer of the causal action principle.
This argument will lead us to a method for further decreasing the causal action. It
also gives some insight on the structure of the minimizing measure. In particular, we
shall see that the effective interaction in the resulting space-time is to be described
effectively by bosonic quantum ﬁelds.

Suppose that .H; F; / is a causal fermion system describing a regularized Dirac
sea conﬁguration (see Sect. 2.5). In order to explain the basic idea, it sufﬁces
to consider the case that  has ﬁnite total volume (which can be arranged for
example by considering the system in a four-dimensional box). For a unitary
transformation V 2 U.H/, we deﬁne the measure V./ by
.V/./ D .VV1/ :

Due to the factor 1=L, the ﬁrst summand becomes small as L increases. The second
summand involves all the contributions for a ¤ b. If we can arrange that these
contributions become small, then the action of the new measure Q will indeed be
smaller than the action of .
Let us consider the contributions for a ¤ b in more detail. In order to simplify
the explanations, it is convenient to assume that the measures Va have mutually
disjoint supports (this can typically be arranged by a suitable choice of the unitary
transformations Va). Then the space-time QM WD supp Q can be decomposed into L

of how the action depends on the unitary operators Va. We ﬁrst note that in the
case a D b, the unitary operators in (95) drop out, so that Pa;a.x; y/ D P.x; y/.
This also explains why the ﬁrst summand in (96) involves the original action S./.
In the a ¤ b, however, the unitary operators in (95) do not drop out. In particular,

this makes it possible to introduce phase factors into the fermionic projector. For
example, one may change the phase of each physical wave function  ua arbitrarily
while keeping the physical wave functions  u
b for b ¤ a unchanged. Choosing
the resulting phases randomly, one gets destructive interference, implying that the
kernel Pa;b.x; y/ becomes small. Making use of this dephasing effect, one can make
the summands in (96) for a ¤ b small. A detailed analysis of the involved scalings
reveals that this indeed makes it possible to decrease the causal action (see [13]).
In words, this result means that minimizing the causal action triggers a mech-
anism which tends to decompose space-time M into many small sub-space-times
M1; : : : ; ML. The physical wave functions in the different sub-space-times involve
relative phases, with the effect that the correlations between the sub-space-times (as
described by the kernels Pa;b.x; y/) become small. Since the dephasing takes place
on a microscopic length scale, this effect is referred to as microscopic mixing.
Let us discuss what microscopic mixing implies for the effective macroscopic
interaction. One must distinguish two situations. One limiting case is complete
dephasing, in which case Pa;b is approximately zero. As a result, there are no
relations or structures between the two sub-space-times (note that for example the
causal structure is encoded in the kernel of the fermionic projector; see Sect. 1.3).
This entails that the two sub-space-times do not interact with each other. The
resulting picture is that space-time looks effectively like a “superposition” of the
different sub-space-times. This scenario is referred to as the microscopic mixing of
space-time regions. The dephasing can be understood similar to decoherence effects
in standard quantum ﬁeld theory (see for example [31]).
If each of the microscopically mixed sub-space-times involves a different
classical bosonic ﬁeld, one obtains effectively a superposition of classical ﬁeld
conﬁgurations. This makes it possible to describe second-quantized bosonic ﬁelds
(see [11]). However, as the different sub-space-times do not interact with each other,
each sub-space-time has it own independent dynamics. This dynamics is described
by the classical bosonic ﬁeld in the corresponding sub-space-time.
In order to obtain an interaction via second-quantized bosonic ﬁelds, one needs
to consider another limiting case in which the dephasing involves only some of
the physical wave functions. In this case, the fermionic projector Pa;b is not
necessarily small. This also implies that relations arising as a consequence of the
collective behavior of all physical wave functions (like the causal relations or
classical bosonic ﬁelds) still exist between the sub-space-times Ma and Mb. In more
physical terms, the sub-space-times still interact with each other. This scenario is
studied in [13] and is referred to as the microscopic mixing of wave functions. In
order to describe the effective interaction, one describes the unitary operators Va
by random matrices. Taking averages over the random matrices, one ﬁnds that the
effective interaction can be described perturbatively in terms of Feynman diagrams
which involve both fermionic and bosonic loops. The appearance of bosonic loops
can be understood by working with second-quantized bosonic ﬁelds. Working out
the detailed combinatorics and the implications of the resulting quantum ﬁeld theory
is work in progress (for the ﬁrst step in this program see [27]).

Abstract In light of the conference Quantum Mathematical Physics held in
Regensburg in 2014, we give our perspective on the external ﬁeld problem in
quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e., QED without photons in which the sole
interaction stems from an external, time-dependent, four-vector potential. Among
others, this model was considered by Dirac, Schwinger, Feynman, and Dyson as a
model to describe the phenomenon of electron-positron pair creation in regimes
in which the interaction between electrons can be neglected and a mean ﬁeld
description of the photon degrees of freedom is valid (e.g., static ﬁeld of heavy
nuclei or lasers ﬁelds). Although it may appear as second easiest model to study,
it already bares a severe divergence in its equations of motion preventing any
straight-forward construction of the corresponding evolution operator. In informal
computations of the vacuum polarization current this divergence leads to the need
of the so-called charge renormalization. In an attempt to provide a bridge between
physics and mathematics, this work gives a review ranging from the heuristic picture
to our rigorous results in a way that is hopefully also accessible to non-experts
and students. We discuss how the evolution operator can be constructed, how this

Heuristic Introduction
We begin with a basic and informal introduction inspired by Dirac’s original work
[9] to provide a physical intuition for the external ﬁeld QED model. Specialists
among the readers are referred directly to Sect. 1.1. As it is well-known, the free
one-particle Dirac equation, in units such that „ D 1 and c D 1,
.i=@  m/ .x/ D 0;
for  2 H D L2.R3; C4/;
(1)
was originally suggested to describe free motion of single electrons. Curiously
enough, it allows for wave functions in the negative part .1; m of the energy
spectrum .H0/ D .1; m \ ŒCm; 1/ of the corresponding Hamiltonian
H0 D 0.i  r C m/. As the spectrum is not bounded from below, physicists
rightfully argue [17] that a Dirac electron coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld
may cascade to ever lower and lower energies by means of radiation; the reason
for this unphysical instability is that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is an open system,
which may transport energy to spacial inﬁnity. Other peculiarities stemming from
the presence of a negative energy spectrum are the so-called Zitterbewegung ﬁrst
observed by Schrödinger [29] and Klein’s paradox [20]. As Dirac demonstrated
[9], those peculiarities can be reconciled in a coherent description when switching
from the one-particle Dirac equation (1) to a many, in the mathematical idealization
even inﬁnitely many, particle description known as the second-quantization of the
Dirac equation. Perhaps the most striking consequence of this description is the
phenomenon of electron-positron pair creation, which only little later was observed
experimentally by Anderson [1].
In order to get rid of peculiarities due to the negative energy states, Dirac
proposed to introduce a “sea” of electrons occupying all negative energy states. The
Pauli exclusion principle then acts to prevent any additional electron in the positive
part of the spectrum to dive into the negative one. Let us introduce the orthogonal
projectors PC and P onto the positive and negative energy subspaces HC and H,
respectively, i.e., HC D PCH and H D PH. Dirac’s heuristic picture amounts

A Perspective on External Field QED
383
to introducing an inﬁnitely many-particle wave function of this sea of electrons,
usually referred to as Dirac sea,
 D '1 ^ '2 ^ '3 ^ : : : ;
.'n/n2N being an orthonormal basis of H;
(2)
where ^ denotes the antisymmetric tensor product w.r.t. Hilbert space H. Given a
one-particle evolution operator U W H ý, such a Dirac sea may then be evolved
with an operator LU according to
LU D U'1 ^ U'2 ^ U'3 ^ : : : :
(3)
Such an ansatz may seem academic and ad-hoc. First, the Coulomb repulsion
between the electrons is neglected (not to mention radiation), second, the choice
of  is somewhat arbitrary. These assumptions clearly would have to be justiﬁed
starting from a yet to be found full version of QED. For the time being we can
only trust Dirac’s intuition that the Dirac sea, when left alone, is so homogeneously
distributed that effectively every electron in it feels the same net interaction from
each solid angle, and in turn, moves freely so that it lies near to neglect the
Coulomb repulsion; see also [3] for a more detailed discussion. Since then none
of the particles effectively “sees” the others, physicists refer to such a state as the
“vacuum”. A less ad-hoc candidate for  would of course be the ground state of a
fully interacting theory. Even though the net interaction may cancel out, electrons
in the ground state will be highly entangled. The hope in using the product state (2)
instead, i.e., the ground state of the free theory, to model the vacuum is that in
certain regimes the particular entanglement and motion deep down in the sea might
be irrelevant. The success of QED in arriving at predictions which are in astonishing
agreement with experimental data substantiates this hope.
As a ﬁrst step to introduce an interaction one allows for an external disturbance
of the electrons in  modeled by a prescribed, time-dependent, four-vector potential
A. This turns the one-particle Dirac equation into
.i=@  m/ .x/ D e=A.x/ .x/:
(4)
The potential A may now allow for transitions of states between the subspaces HC
and H. Heuristically speaking, a state '1 2 H in the Dirac sea  may be bound
by the potential and over time dragged to the positive energy subspace  2 HC. For
an (as we shall see, oversimpliﬁed) example, let us assume that up to a phase the
resulting state can be represented as
‰ D  ^ '2 ^ '3 ^ : : :
(5)
in which '1 is missing. Due to (4), states in HC move rather differently as compared
to the ones in H. Thus, an electron described by  2 HC will emerge from the
“vacuum” and so does the “hole” described by the missing '1 2 H in the Dirac
sea (5), which is left behind. Following Dirac, the hole itself can be interpreted as a

384

particle, which is referred to as positron, and both names can be used as synonyms.
If, as in this example, the electrons deeper down in the sea are not affected too
much by this disturbance, it makes sense to switch to a more economic description.
Instead of tracking all inﬁnitely many particles, it then sufﬁces to describe the
motion of the electron , of the corresponding hole '1, and of the net evolution of 
only. Since the number of electron-hole pairs may vary over time, a formalism for
variable particle numbers is needed. This is provided by the Fock space formalism
of quantum ﬁeld theory, i.e., the so-called “second quantization”. One introduces a
so-called creation operator a that formally acts as
a./'1 ^ '2 ^ : : : D  ^ '1 ^ '2 ^ : : : ;
(6)
and also its corresponding adjoint a, which is called annihilation operator. The state
‰ from example in (5) can then be written as ‰ D a./a.'1/. With the help
of a, one-particle operators like the evolution operator UA generated by (4) can be
lifted to an operator QU on F in a canonical way by requiring that
QUAa. f/. QUA/1 D a.UAf/:
(7)
This condition determines a lift up to a phase as can be seen from the left-hand side
of (7). Since the operator a. f/ is linear in its argument f 2 H, it is commonly split
into the sum
a. f/ D b. f/ C c. f/
with
b. f/ WD a.PCf/;
c. f/ WD a.Pf/:
(8)
Hence, b and c and their adjoints are creation and annihilation operators of
electrons having positive and negative energy, respectively. In order to be able
to disregard the inﬁnitely many-particle wave function  in the notation, one
introduces the following change in language. First, the space generated by states
of the form b. f1/b. f2/ : : : b. fn/ for fk 2 HC is identiﬁed with the electron

Fh D
M
n2N0
.H/^n:
(10)
Note that this time the annihilation operator of negative energy states is employed to
generate the Fock space. To make this evident in the notation, one usually replaces

A Perspective on External Field QED
385
c.g/ by a creation operator d.g/. However, unlike creation operators, c.g/ is anti-
linear in its argument g 2 H. Thus, in a third step one replaces H by its complex
conjugate H, i.e., the set H equipped with the usual C-vector space structure
except for the scalar multiplication ? W C  H ! H which is redeﬁned by
 ? g D g for all  2 C and g 2 H. This turns Fh into
Fh D
M
n2N0
.H/^n;
(11)
and the hole creation operator d.g/ D c.g/ becomes linear in its argument g 2 H.
To treat electrons and holes more symmetrically, one also introduces the anti-linear
charge conjugation operator C W H ! H, C D i2 . This operator exchanges
HC and H, i.e., CH˙ D H, and thus, gives rise to a linear map C W H !
HC. A hole wave function g 2 H living in the space negative states can then
be represented by a wave function Cg 2 HC living in the positive energy space.
Our discussion of the Dirac sea above may appear to break the charge symmetry as
 is represented by a sea of electrons in H. However, an equivalent description
that makes the charge symmetry explicit is possible by representing the vacuum 
through a pair of two seas, one in HC and one in H. Nevertheless, as the charge
symmetry will not play a role in this overview we will continue using Dirac’s picture
with a sea of electrons in H.
By deﬁnition (6) it can be seen that b; b and d; d fulﬁll the well-known anti-
commutator relations:
fb.g/; b.h/g D 0 D fb.g/; b.h/g;
fd.g/; d.h/g D 0 D fd.g/; d.h/g;
fb.g/; b.h/g D

g; PCh

idFe;
fd.g/; d.h/g D hg; PhiidFh :
(12)
The full Fock space for the electrons and positrons is then given by
F D Fe ˝ Fh:
(13)
In this space the vacuum wave function  in (2) is represented by j0i D 1 ˝ 1 and
the pair state ‰ in (5) by a./d.'1/j0i. Thus, in this notation one only describes
the excitations of the vacuum, i.e., those electrons that deviate from it. The inﬁnitely
many other electrons in the Dirac sea one preferably would like to forget about are
successfully hidden in the symbol j0i. Here, however, the story ends abruptly.
1.1
The Problem and a Program for a Cure
For a prescribed external potential A, one would be inclined to compute transition
probabilities for the creation of pairs, as for example for a transition from  to
‰ as in (2) and (5), right away. Given the one-particle Dirac evolution operator

386

UA D UA.t1; t0/ generated by (4) and any orthonormal basis .n/n of HC, the ﬁrst
order of perturbation of the probability of a possible pair creation is given by
X

n; UA'm
˛ˇˇ2 D kUA
CkI2;
(14)
where I2.H/ denotes the space of bounded operators with ﬁnite Hilbert-Schmidt
norm kkI2, and we use the notation UA
˙ D P˙UAP. For quite general potentials
A D .A0; A/, it turns out that:
Theorem 1.1 ([26]) Term (14) < 1 for all times t0; t1 2 R , A D 0.
In view of (14), the transition probability is thus only deﬁned for external
potentials A that have zero spatial components A. Even worse, the criterion for
the well-deﬁnedness of a possible lift QU of any unitary one-particle operator U
according to (7) is given by:
Theorem 1.2 ([30]) There is a unitary operator QU W F ý that fulﬁlls (7) ,
UC; UC 2 I2.H/.
Applying this result to the evolution operator UA, (14) and Theorem 1.1 imply
that the criterion in Theorem 1.2 is only fulﬁlled for external potentials A with zero
spatial components A. Even more peculiar, the given criterion is not gauge covariant
(not to mention the Lorentz covariance). Although the free evolution operator UAD0
has a lift, in the case that some spatial derivatives of a scalar ﬁeld  are non-zero,
the gauge transformed UAD@ does not. This indicates that an unphysical assumption
must have been made.
What singles out the spatial components of A? Mathematically, they appear in the
Hamiltonian, HA D 0.i  C m/ C A0  0  A, preceded by the spinor matrix
0 whereas A0 is only a multiple of the identity. Heuristically, if A is non-zero then
the 0 matrix transforms the negative energy states 'n in spinor space to develop
components in HC. There is no mechanism that would limit this development, not
even smallness of jAj, so there is no reason why the inﬁnite sum (14) should be ﬁnite
– and in general this is also not the case as Theorem 1.1 shows. In other words, for
A ¤ 0, instantly inﬁnitely many electron-positron pairs are created from the vacuum
state . Therefore, the picture is not nearly as peaceful as suggested by example
state (5). However, if A is switched off at some later time one can expect that almost
all of these pairs disappear again, and only a few excitations of the vacuum as in (5)
will remain (hence, the name virtual pairs that is used by physicists). Assuming
that at initial and ﬁnal times A D 0, it can indeed be shown that the scattering
matrix SA fulﬁlls the conditions of Theorem 1.2. The physical reason why the spatial
components are singled out is due to the use of equal-time hyperplanes and will be
discussed more geometrically in Sect. 2; see Theorem 2.8 below.
In conclusion, the problem lies in the fact that even the “vacuum”  consists of
inﬁnitely many particles. In the formalism of the free theory this fact is usually
hidden by the use of normal ordering. Without it the ground state energy of 
would be the inﬁnite sum of all negative energies, or the charge current operator

A Perspective on External Field QED
387
expectation value h; a	ai of the vacuum would simply be the inﬁnite sum of all
one-particle currents 'n	'n – both quantities that diverge. The rational behind the
ad-hoc introduction of normal ordering of, e.g., the charge current operator is again
the assumption that in the vacuum state these currents are effectively not observable
since the net interaction between the particles vanishes.
The incompatibility of Theorem 1.2 with the gauge freedom however shows that,
although the choice of  may be distinguished for A D 0 by the ground state
property, it is somehow arbitrary when A ¤ 0, and so is the choice in the splitting of
H into HC and H, which is usually referred to as polarization. As a program for a
cure of these divergences, one may therefore attempt to carefully adapt the choice of
the polarization depending on the evolution of A instead of keeping it ﬁxed. Several
attempts have been made to give a deﬁnition of a more physical polarization, one
of them being the Furry picture. It deﬁnes the polarization according to the positive
and negative parts of the spectrum of HA given a ﬁxed A. Unfortunately, none of the
proposed choices are Lorentz invariant as it is shown in [10] since the vacuum state
w.r.t. one of such choices in one frame of reference may appear as a many-particle
state in another. This is due to the fact that the energy spectrum is obviously not
invariant under Lorentz boosts.
Although a fully developed QED may be able to distinguish a class of states
that can be regarded as physical vacuum states, simply by verifying the assumption
above that the net interaction between the particles vanishes, the external ﬁeld
QED model has no mathematical structure to do so. Nevertheless, whenever a
distinction between electrons and positrons by means of a polarization is not
necessary, e.g., in the case of vacuum polarization in which the exact number of
pairs is irrelevant, it should still be possible to track the time evolution QUA and
study the generated dynamics – not only asymptotically in scattering theory but
also at intermediate times. The choice in admissible polarizations can then be seen
to be analogous to the choice of a convenient coordinate system to represent the
Dirac seas. Since the employed Fock space F depends directly on the polarization
of H into HC and H, see (9)–(10) and (13), the standard formalism has to be
adapted to allow the Fock space to also vary according to A, and the evolution
operator QUA must be implemented mapping one Fock space into another. While the
idea of varying Fock space may be unfamiliar from the non-relativistic setting, it is
natural when considering a relativistic formalism. A Lorentz boost, for example,
tilts an equal-time hyperplane to a Cauchy surface † which requires a change
from the standard Hilbert space H D L2.R3; C4/ to one that is attached to †,
and likewise, for the corresponding Fock spaces. Hence, a Lorentz transform will
naturally be described by a map from one Fock space into another [5]. In the special
case of equal-time hyperplanes, parts of this program have been carried out in
[21, 22] and [4]. In the former two works the time evolution operator is nevertheless
implemented on standard Fock space F by conjugation of the evolution operator
with a convenient (non-unique) unitary “renormalization” transformation. In the
latter work it is implemented between time-varying Fock spaces, so-called inﬁnite
wedge spaces, and furthermore, the degrees of freedom in the construction have
been identiﬁed. These latter results have been extended recently to allow for general

388
D. Deckert and F. Merkl
Cauchy surfaces in [5, 6] and are presented in Sect. 2. All these results ensure
the existence of an evolution operator by a quite abstract argument. Therefore,
we review a construction of it in Sect. 3 based on [4]. It utilizes a notation that
is very close to Dirac’s original view of a sea of electrons as in (2). Though it is
canonically equivalent to the Fock space formalism, it provided us a more intuitive
view of the problem and helped in identifying the degrees of freedom involved
in the construction. In Sect. 4 we conclude with a discussion of the unidentiﬁed
phase of the evolution operator and its meaning for the charge current in. Beside
the publications cited so far, there are several recent contributions which also take
up on Dirac’s original idea. As a more fundamental approach we want to mention
the one of the so-called “Theory of Causal Fermion Systems” [11–13], which is
based on a reformulation of quantum electrodynamics from ﬁrst principles. The
phenomenon of adiabatic pair creation was treated rigorously in [24]. Furthermore,
there is a series of works treating the Dirac sea in the Hartree-Fock approximation.
The most general is [16] in which the effect of vacuum polarization was treated
self-consistently for static external sources.

Varying Fock Spaces
In order to better understand why the spatial components of A had been singled out
in the discussion above, it is helpful to consider the Dirac evolution not only on
equal-time hyperplanes but on more general Cauchy surfaces.
Deﬁnition 2.1 A Cauchy surface † in R4 is a smooth, 3-dimensional submanifold
of R4 that fulﬁlls the following two conditions:
(a) Every inextensible, two-sided, time- or light-like, continuous path in R4
intersects † in a unique point.
(b) For every x 2 †, the tangent space Tx† of † at x is space-like.
To each Cauchy surface † we associated a Hilbert space H†.
Deﬁnition 2.2 Let H† D L2.†; C4/ denote the vector space of all 4-spinor valued
measurable functions  W † ! C4 (modulo changes on null sets) having a ﬁnite

subset of smooth and compactly supported functions will be denoted by C†.

general hyperbolic systems and more speciﬁcally for wave equations on Lorentzian
manifolds [2, 8, 14, 25], and [7]. For the purpose of our study we furthermore
introduced generalized Fourier transforms for the Dirac equation in [5] and extended
the standard Sobolev and Paley-Wiener methods in Rn to the geometry given by
the Cauchy surfaces and the mass shell of the Dirac equation. These methods were
required for the analysis of solutions. They play along nicely with Lorentz and gauge
transforms and allow for the introduction of an interaction picture. As a byproduct,
these methods also ensure existence, uniqueness, and causal structure of strong
solutions. Since we avoid technicalities in this paper, we assume A is a smooth and
compactly supported (although sufﬁcient strong decay would be sufﬁcient), and the
following theorem will sufﬁce to discuss the one-particle Dirac evolution.
Theorem 2.3 (Theorem 2.23 in [5]) Let †; †0 be two Cauchy surfaces and  † 2
C† the initial data. There is a unique strong solution  2 C1.R4; C4/ to (4) being
supported in the forward and backward light cone of supp  † such that  j† D  †
holds. Furthermore, there is an isometric isomorphism UA
†0† W C† ! C†0 fulﬁlling
 j†0 D UA
†0† †. Its unique extension to a unitary map UA
†0† W H† ! H†0 is
denoted by the same symbol.
Similarly to the standard Fock space (13) we deﬁne the Fock space for a Cauchy
surface on the basis of a polarization.
Deﬁnition 2.4 Let Pol.H†/ denote the set of all closed, linear subspaces V  H†
such that V and V? are both inﬁnite dimensional. Any V 2 Pol.H†/ is called a
polarization of H†. For V 2 Pol.H†/, let PV
† W H† ! V denote the orthogonal
projection of H† onto V.
The Fock space attached to Cauchy surface † and corresponding to polarization
V 2 Pol.H†/ is deﬁned by
F.V; †/ WD

Note that the standard Fock space is included in this deﬁnition by choosing † D
f0g  R3 and V D H.
Given two Cauchy surfaces † and †0, polarizations V 2 Pol.H†/ and V0 2
Pol.H†0/, and the one-particle evolution operator UA
†0† W H† ! H†0, we need a
condition analogous to (7) that allows us to ﬁnd an evolution operator QUA
V0;†0IV;† W
F.V; †/ ! F.V0; †0/. For the discussion, let a
† and a† denote the corresponding
creation and annihilation operators on any F.W; †/ for W 2 Pol.H†/; note that
the deﬁning expression of a in (6) does not depend on the choice of a polarization
W. In this notation, the lift requirement reads

The condition under which such a lift of the one-particle evolution operator UA
†0†
exists can be inferred from a slightly rewritten version of the Shale-Stinespring
Theorem 1.2:
Corollary 2.5 Let †; †0 be Cauchy surfaces, V 2 Pol.H†/, and V0 2 Pol.H†0/.
Then the following statements are equivalent:
(a) There is a unitary operator QUA
V0†0IV;†
W
F.V; †/

F.V0; †0/ which
fulﬁlls (17).
(b) The off-diagonals PV0?
†0 UA
†0†PV
† and PV0
†0UA
†0†PV?
†
are Hilbert-Schmidt opera-
tors.
Note again that if such a lift exists, its phase is not ﬁxed by (17) and the corollary
above does not provide any information about it. Therefore, we will discuss a direct
construction of the lifted operator QUA
V0†0IV;† in Sect. 3, which makes the involved
degrees of freedom apparent.
Coming back to the question which polarizations V 2 Pol.H†/ and V0 2
Pol.H†0/ guarantee the existence of a lifted evolution operator QUA
†0† W F.V; †/ !
F.V0; †0/, one readily ﬁnds a trivial choice. Let us pick a Cauchy surface †in in the
remote past fulﬁlling:
†in is a Cauchy surface such that supp A \ †in D ;:
(18)
When transporting the standard polarization along with the Dirac evolution we get
V D UA
††in P
†inH†in 2 Pol.H†/;
V0 D UA
†0†in P
†inH†in 2 Pol.H†0/;
(19)
which automatically fulﬁlls condition (b) of Theorem 2.5 as then the off-diagonals
.UA
††in/˙ become zero. This choice is usually called the interpolation picture.
Its drawback is that the polarizations V and V0 depend on the whole history
of A between †in and † and †0. Moreover, such V and V0 are rather implicit.
Luckily, there are other choices. Statement (b) in Theorem 2.5 allows to differ
from the projectors PV
† and PV0
†0 by a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. Hence, all admissible
polarizations can be collected and characterized by means of the following classes:
Deﬁnition 2.6 For a Cauchy surface † we deﬁne the class
C†.A/ WD
˚
W 2 Pol.H†/
ˇˇ W  UA
††inH
†in

(20)
where for V; W 2 Pol.H†/, V  W means that the difference of the corresponding
orthogonal projectors PV
†  PW
† is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.
As simple implication of Corollary 2.5 one gets:

A Perspective on External Field QED
391
Corollary 2.7 Let †; †0 be Cauchy surfaces and polarizations V 2 C†.A/ and
W 2 C†0.A/. Then up to a phase there is a unitary operator QUA
†0† W F.V; H†/ !
F.W; H†0/ obeying (17).
We emphasize again that any other possible polarization than the choice in (19) is
comprised in the respective class C†.A/ as Corollary 2.5 only allows for the freedom
encoded in the equivalence relation . Although the polarization (19) depends on
the history of the evolution it turns out that the classes C†.A/ are independent
thereof. The sole dependence of the classes C†.A/ is on the tangential components
of A, which can be stated as follows.
Theorem 2.8 (Theorem 1.5 in [6]) Let † be a Cauchy surface and let A and QA be
two smooth and compactly supported external ﬁelds. Then
C†.A/ D C†.QA/
,
AjT† D QAjT†;
(21)
where AjT† D QAjT† means that for all x in † and all vectors y in the tangent space
Tx† of † at x, the relation A	.x/y	 D QA	.x/y	 holds.
This theorem is a generalization of Ruijsenaar’s result [27] and helps to
understand why on equal-time hyperplanes the spatial components of A appeared to
play such a special role. The spatial components A are the tangential ones w.r.t. such
Cauchy surfaces. Furthermore, the classes C†.A/ transform nicely under Lorentz
and gauge transformations:
Theorem 2.9 (Theorem 1.6 in [6])
(i) Consider a Lorentz transformation given by L.S;ƒ/
†
W H† ! Hƒ† for a spinor
transformation matrix S 2 C44 and an associated proper orthochronous
Lorentz transformation matrix ƒ 2 SO".1; 3/, see for example [5, Section 2.3].
Then:
V 2 C†.A/
,
L.S;ƒ/
†
V 2 Cƒ†.ƒA.ƒ1//:
(22)
(ii) Consider a gauge transformation A0 D A C @ for some  2 C1
c .R4; R/ given
by the multiplication operator ei W H† ! H†,  7!  0 D ei . Then:
V 2 C†.A/
,
eiV 2 C†.A C @/:
(23)
As an analogy from geometry one could think of the particular polarization as
a particular choice of coordinates to represent the Dirac sea. Corollary 2.5 and
Theorem 2.9 explain why gauge transformations that introduce spatial components
in the external ﬁelds do not comply with the condition to the Shale-Stinespring
Theorem 1.2 in which the “coordinates” HC and H were ﬁxed.
The key idea in the proofs of Theorems 2.8 and 2.9 is to guess a simple enough
operator PA
† W H† ý depending only on the restriction Aj† so that

D. Deckert and F. Merkl
The claims about the properties of the polarization classes C†.A/ can then be
inferred directly from the properties of PA
†. This is due to the fact that (24) is
compatible with the Hilbert-Schmidt operator freedom encoded in the  equiva-
lence relation. The intuition behind the guess of PA
† used in the proofs presented
in [6] comes from the gauge transform. Imagine the special situation in which
an external potential A could be gauged to zero, i.e., A D @ for a given scalar
ﬁeld . In this case eiP
†ei is a good candidate for PA
†. Now in the case of
general external potentials A that cannot be attained by a gauge transformation
of the zero potential, the idea is to implement gauge transforms locally at each
space-time point. For example, if p.x; y/ denotes the informal integral kernel of
the operator P
†, one could try to deﬁne PA
† as the operator corresponding to the
informal kernel pA.x; y/ D eiA.x;y/p.x; y/ for the choice A.x/ D A.x/	.y  x/	.
The effect of A.x; y/ on the projector can be interpreted as a local gauge transform
of p.x; y/ from the zero potential to the potential A	.x/ at space-time point x. A
careful analysis of PA
†, which was conducted in Section 2 of [6], shows that PA
†
fulﬁlls (24).
Finally, given Cauchy surface †, there is also an explicit representative of the
polarization class C†.A/ which can be given in terms of the bounded operator QA
† W

QA

(25)
With it, the polarization class can be identiﬁed as follows:
Theorem 2.10 (Theorem 1.7 in [6]) Given Cauchy surface †,

The implications of these results on the physical picture can be seen as follows.
The Dirac sea on Cauchy surface † can be described in any Fock space F.V; H†/
for any choice of polarization V 2 C†.A/. The polarization class C†.A/ is uniquely
determined by the tangential components of the external potential A on †. When
regarding the Dirac evolution from one Cauchy surface † to †0, another choice
of “coordinates” V0 2 C†0.A/ has to be made. Then one yields an evolution
operator QUA
†0† W F.V; H†/ ! F.V0; H†0/ which is unique up to an arbitrary phase.
Transition probabilities jh‰; QUA
†0†ˆij2 for ‰ 2 F.V0; H†0/ and ˆ 2 F.V; H†/ are
well-deﬁned and unique without the need of a renormalization method. Finally, for
a family of Cauchy surfaces .†t/t2R that interpolates smoothly between † and †0
one can also infer an inﬁnitesimal version of how the external potential A changes
the polarization in terms of the ﬂow parameter t; see Theorem 2.6 in [6].
We remark that the kernel of the orthogonal projector corresponding to a
polarization in C†.A/, which can be interpreted as a distribution, is frequently called
two-point function. Two kernels belonging to two polarizations in the same class
C†.A/ may differ by a square-integrable kernel. This stands in contrast to the so-
called Hadamard property (see, e.g., [19]) which allows changes with C1 kernels
as freedom in two-point functions.

An Explicit Construction of the Evolution Operator
The argument in Sect. 2 that ensures the existence of dynamics on varying Fock
spaces is quite abstract. In this section we present a more direct approach that is
also closer to Dirac’s original picture in describing inﬁnite particle wave functions
like in (2). As discussed, the inﬁnitely many particles are also present in the usual
Fock space formalism but commonly hidden by use of normal ordering. But since
the very obstacle in a straight-forward construction of the evolution operator is due
to their presence, it seems to make sense to work with a formalism that makes them
apparent. One such formalism, introduced in Section 2 of [4], employs so-called
inﬁnite wedge spaces and will be used in the following.
To leave our discussion general, let H be a one-particle Hilbert space (e.g.,
H D H† as in Sect. 2) and let V 2 Pol.H/ be a polarization thereof. The
Dirac sea corresponding to that choice of polarization can be represented, using
any orthonormal basis .'n/n2N that spans V, by the inﬁnite wedge product
ƒˆ D '1 ^ '2 ^ '3 ^ : : : ;
(26)
i.e., the anti-symmetric product of all wave functions 'n, n 2 N. Slightly more
general, it sufﬁces if .'n/n2N is only asymptotically orthonormal in the sense that
the inﬁnite matrix .h'n; 'mi/n;m2N has a (Fredholm) determinant, i.e., that it differs
from the identity only by a matrix that has a trace. The reason for this property will
become clear when introducing the scalar product of two inﬁnite wedge products.
In order to keep the formalism short, we encode the basis .'n/n2N by a bounded
linear operator
ˆ W ` ! H;
ˆ en D 'n
(27)
on a Hilbert space `. The role of ` is only that of an index space, and one example
we have in mind is ` D `2.N/, i.e., the space of square summable sequences where
the vectors en, n 2 N, denote the canonical basis. In this language, the asymptotic
orthonormality requirement from above can be rewritten as ˆˆ 2 id` CI1.`/,
where I1.`/ is the space of bounded linear maps ` ! ` which have a trace, the
so-called trace class. We will also write ƒˆ D '1 ^ '2 ^ : : : which denotes the
inﬁnite wedge product (26) and refer to all such ˆ as Dirac seas.
Given another Dirac sea ‰ with  n D ‰en, n 2 N, the pairing that will later
become a scalar product
hƒ‰; ƒˆi D h 1 ^  2 ^ : : : ; '1 ^ '2 ^ : : :i D det.h n; 'mi/nm D det ‰ˆ
(28)
is well-deﬁned if ‰ˆ has a determinant, which is the case if ‰ˆ 2 id` CI1.`/.
Thus, it makes sense to build a Fock space, referred to as “inﬁnite wedge space
Fƒˆ”, based on a basis encoded by ˆ. It is deﬁned by the completion w.r.t. the

394
D. Deckert and F. Merkl
pairing (28) of the space of formal linear combinations of all such ‰; see Section 2.1
in [4] for a rigorous construction. This space consists of the sea wave function
ƒˆ, its excitations ƒ‰ that form a generating set, and superpositions thereof.
An example excitation analogous to (5) representing an electron-positron pair with
electron wave function  2 V? and positron wave function '1 2 V is given by
ƒ‰ D  ^ '2 ^ '3 ^ '4 ^ : : : :
(29)
Note, however, that mathematically ˆ is not distinguished as “the one vacuum”
state as it turns out that Fƒˆ D Fƒ‰ if and only if ‰ˆ has a determinant, i.e.,
if the scalar product hƒ‰; ƒˆi in (28) is well-deﬁned. This is due to the fact that
‰  ˆ W, ‰ˆ 2 id` CI1.`/ is an equivalence relation on the set of all Dirac
seas; see Corollary 2.9 in [4].
Next, let us consider another one-particle Hilbert space H0 und a one-particle
unitary operator U W H ! H0 such as the one-particle Dirac evolution operator
UA
†0†. To infer from this a corresponding evolution of the Dirac seas, we deﬁne a
canonical operation from the left as follows
LU W Fƒˆ ! FƒUˆ;
LU ƒ‰ WD ƒU‰ D .U 1/ ^ .U 2/ ^ : : : :
(30)
Here, ‰ is taken from the generating set of Dirac seas fulﬁlling ‰ˆ 2 1 C I1.`/;
see Section 2.2 in [4]. That the range of LU is FƒUˆ is due to the fact that ‰ˆ
has a determinant if and only if .U‰/.Uˆ/ does. Such a map LU represents an
evolution operator from one inﬁnite wedge space into another that in the sense of (6)
also complies with the previously discussed lift condition (7).
Nevertheless, the construction of the evolution operator for the Dirac seas does
not end here because the target space FƒUˆ in (30) is completely implicit, and
hence, LU alone is not very helpful. On the contrary, relying on the observations
made in Sect. 2, physics should allow us to decide beforehand between which
inﬁnite wedge spaces the evolution operator should be implemented. Consider the
example situation of
an evolution operator U D UA
†0† from Theorem 2.3;
H D H†;
V 2 Pol.H†/;
ˆ W ` ! H† such that range ˆ D V;
H0 D H†0;
V0 2 Pol.H†0/;
ˆ0 W `0 ! H†0 such that range ˆ0 D V0:
(31)
In this situation one would wish for an evolution operator of the form QU W Fƒ !
Fƒˆ0 instead of QU W Fƒ ! FƒUˆ. If we are not in the lucky case Fƒˆ0 D FƒUˆ,
there are two ways in which the equality may fail. First, Corollary 2.5 suggests that
polarization V and V0 must be elements of the appropriate polarization classes, more
precisely, V 2 C†.A/ and V0 2 C†0.A/. However, there is a more subtle obstacle
as for Fˆ0 D FƒUˆ to hold we need to ensure that hˆ0; Uˆi is well-deﬁned, which

A Perspective on External Field QED
395
even for ` D `0 and admissible V and V0 does need not to be the case. Thus, in
general Uˆ and ˆ0 belong to entirely different inﬁnite wedge spaces as the choice
of orthonormal bases encoded in ˆ and ˆ0 was somehow arbitrary. However, let
‰ W ` ! H0 be another Dirac sea with range ‰ D V0, then there is a unitary
R W `0 ! ` such that ˆ0 D ‰R. The action of R gives rise to a unitary operation
from the right RR characterized by
RR W Fƒ‰ ! Fƒ‰R;
RR ƒ Q‰ D ƒ. Q‰R/
(32)
for all Q‰ W ` ! H0 in the generating system of Fƒ‰, which connects the inﬁnite
wedge spaces Fƒ‰ and Fƒˆ0. The spaces Fƒ‰ and Fƒˆ0 coincide if and only if
` D `0 and R has a determinant. Slightly more generally, it sufﬁces if R is only
asymptotically unitary in the sense that RR has a non-zero determinant. Then the
operation from the right det.RR/1=2RR is unitary. Whether there is a unitary
R W `0 ! ` in the situation of example (31) above such that FƒUˆR D Fƒˆ0 is
answered by the next theorem. It can be seen as yet another version of the Shale and
Stinespring’s Theorem:
Theorem 3.11 (Theorem 2.26 of [4]) Let H; `; H0; `0 be Hilbert spaces, V 2
Pol.H/ and V0 2 Pol.H0/ polarizations, ˆ W ` ! H and ˆ0 W `0 ! H0 Dirac
seas such that rangeˆ D V and rangeˆ0 D V0. Then the following statements are
equivalent:
(a) The off-diagonals PV0?UPV and PV0UPV? are Hilbert-Schmidt operators.
(b) There is a unitary R W `0 ! ` such that Fƒˆ0 D FƒUˆR.
Coming back to the example (31) from above, in the case V 2 C†.A/ and
V0 2 C†0.A/, i.e., that the chosen polarization belong to the admissible classes of
polarizations, condition (a) of Theorem 3.11 is fulﬁlled, which implies the existence
of a unitary map R W V0 ! V such that the evolution operator
QUA
V;†IV0†0 W Fƒˆ ! Fƒˆ0;
QUA
V;†IV0†0 D RR ı LUA
†0†
(33)
is well-deﬁned and unitary. An immediate question is of course how many such
maps exist, and it turns out that any other operation from the right RR0 for which
RR0ıLU W Fƒˆ ! Fƒˆ0 is well-deﬁned and unitary fulﬁlls QUA
V;†IV0†0 D ei RR0ıLU
for some  2 R; see [4, Corollary 2.28]. Now ˆ and ˆ0 are Dirac seas in which
all states in V and V0 are occupied, respectively. A canonical choice for their
representation is to choose ` D V, `0 D V0, and to deﬁne the inclusion maps
ˆ W V ,! H†, ˆv D v for all v 2 V, and ˆ0 W V0 ,! H†0, ˆ0v0 D v0 for all
v0 2 V0. In this case there is a canonical isomorphism between the spaces Fƒˆ and
FV;† as well as between Fƒˆ0 and FV0;†0. Hence, we are again in the situation of
Corollary 2.5. We can identify the evolution of the Dirac seas only up to a phase
 2 R. However, now we have a more direct construction at hand which identiﬁes
the involved degrees of freedom:

396
D. Deckert and F. Merkl
(a) The choice of particular polarizations V 2 C†.A/ and V0 2 C†0.A/.
(b) The choice of particular bases encoded in ˆ and ˆ0.
The restriction of the polarizations to polarization classes in (a) has been discussed
in Sect. 2. Moreover, choice (b) can be given a quite intuitive picture coming from
Dirac’s original idea that the motion deep down in the sea should be irrelevant when
studying the excitations on its “surface”. Clearly, when a sea wave function ƒ‰ 2
Fƒˆ, which could represent an excitation w.r.t. ƒˆ, is evolved from † to ƒ‰0 on
†0, clearly also the particles deep down in the sea will “move”. Since there are
inﬁnitely many it will be impossible to directly compare ‰0 with ‰ in general.

(34)
the motion deep down in the sea is governed by U. Now, if according to Dirac’s
original idea the motion deep down in the sea can be considered irrelevant for the
behavior of the excitations on its surface one should still be able to compare ƒ‰0
to ƒ‰ when reversing the motion deep down in the sea with .U/1. If U is for
example sufﬁciently close to the identity this can be done explicitly since then U
has an inverse R D .U/1. As we shall see now, the inversion of the motion deep
down in the sea can be implemented by means of an operation from the right RR. For
R to induce an operation from the right it has to be asymptotically orthonormal, i.e.,
RR must have a determinant. Recall that condition (a) in Theorem 3.11 states that
the off-diagonals UC and UC are Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Thanks to UU D
idH the identity
U
U D idV .U/CUC
(35)
holds, and since the product of two Hilbert-Schmidt operators has a trace, one ﬁnds
U
U 2 idV CI1.V/. Thus, U
U and then also RR have determinants. Note
that in general det.RR/ ¤ 1, which implies that RR may fail to be unitary up to the
factor det jRj. By deﬁnition one ﬁnds
RR ı LUFƒˆ D FƒUˆR D Fƒˆ0
(36)
because ˆ0UˆR D PV0.UC C U/R D idV0, and therefore, has a determinant.
In consequence, we obtain the unitary Dirac evolution

which implements both the forward evolution of the whole Dirac sea and the
backward evolution of the states deep down in the sea.

The Charge Current and the Phase of the Evolution
Operator
Although the construction of the second-quantized evolution operator according to
the above program is successful, it fails to identify the phase. This short-coming has
no effect on the uniqueness of transition probabilities but it turns out that the charge
current depends directly on this phase. One way to see that is from Bogolyubov’s
formula of the current
J	.x/ D i QUA
Vin;†inIVout†out
ı
ıA	.x/
QUA
Vout;†outIVin;†in;
(38)
where †out is a Cauchy surface in the remote future of the support of A such
that †out \ supp A D ;. Changing the evolution operator by an A-dependent
phase generates another summand on the right hand side of (38) by the chain
rule. Until some phase is distinguished, (38) has no particular physical meaning
as charge current. Nevertheless, all possible currents can be derived from (38) given
an evolution operator and a particular phase. Therefore, the situation is better than
in standard QED. There, the charge current is a quantity whose formal perturbation
series leads to several divergent integrals which have to be taken out by hand until
only a logarithmic divergence is left, which in turn is remedied by means of charge
renormalization. On the contrary, here, the currents are well-deﬁned and in a sense
the correct one only needs to be identiﬁed by determining the phase of the evolution
operator. As already envisioned in [28] and discussed by [15, 22], this may be done
by imposing extra conditions on the evolution operator. One of them is clearly the
following property. For any choice of a future oriented foliation of space-time into
a family of Cauchy surfaces .†t/t2R and polarizations Vt 2 C†t.A/, t 2 R, the
assigned phase of the evolution operator QUA.t1; t0/ D QUA
†t1;Vt1I†t0;Vt0 constructed in
Sect. 3 should be required to fulﬁll QU.t1; t0/ D QU.t1; t/ QU.t; t0/. Other constraints
come from the fact that J	.x/ must be Lorentz and gauge covariant, and its vacuum
expectation value for A D 0 should be zero. The hope is that the collection of all
such physical constraints restrict the possible currents (38) to a class which can be
parametrized by a real number only, the electric charge of the electron. In the case of
equal-time hyperplanes one possible choice of the phase was given by Mickelsson
via a parallel transport argument [23]. On top of the nice geometric construction
and despite the fact that there are still degrees of freedom left, Mickelsson’s current
agrees with conventional perturbation theory up to second order. The aim of this
program is to settle the question which conditions are required to identify the charge
current upon changes of the value of the electric charge.

Abstract Riemann surfaces are two-dimensional manifolds with a conformal class
of metrics. It is well known that the harmonic action functional and harmonic maps
are tools to study the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. Super Riemann surfaces
are an analogue of Riemann surfaces in the world of super geometry. After a short
introduction to super differential geometry we will compare Riemann surfaces and
super Riemann surfaces. We will see that super Riemann surfaces can be viewed
as Riemann surfaces with an additional ﬁeld, the gravitino. An extension of the
harmonic action functional to super Riemann surfaces is presented and applications
to the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces are considered.

The theory of Riemann surfaces is a very old and very interesting topic. Since the
end of the nineteenth century Riemann surfaces have been explored with different
approaches from different areas of mathematics ranging from algebraic geometry to
analysis. In particular the description of Riemann surfaces in terms of conformal
classes of metrics and the Teichmüller theory has an interesting connection to
harmonic maps and the harmonic action functional (see, for example, [14]).
Harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces are particular non-linear sigma models.
In contrary, Super Riemann surfaces are a rather new topic. They appeared in
the context of super gravity and super string theory around 1985, see [10, 22].
Super Riemann surfaces have been formalized using the language of super geometry
(see e.g. [20]), an extension of differential or algebraic geometry. Super Riemann
surfaces are particular complex super manifolds of complex dimension 1j1. Even
though they possess one even and one odd dimension they are said to behave in
certain regards as if they were one-dimensional. Different approaches from the
theory of Riemann surfaces have been “superized”, such as uniformization [4] and
universal deformation spaces [19].
The approach to super Riemann surfaces via super conformality and a super
harmonic action functional is very interesting for physics, as it appears in a super
symmetric non-linear sigma model. In [2, 7] it was proposed to consider a super
symmetric extension of the harmonic action functional A.'; g/ where both the
metric g and the ﬁeld ' get a super partner,  and  respectively. This particular
super symmetric non-linear sigma model is relevant for string theory and super
gravity.
It was conjectured that a super Riemann surface M can be described by a metric g
and the super partner of the metric, called gravitino  on a two dimensional manifold
jMj. The action of the non-linear super symmetric sigma model would then be an
integral over the super manifold M, resembling the harmonic action functional on
jMj. Mathematically this leads to a different approach to the moduli space of super
Riemann surfaces. In a talk at the conference “Quantum Mathematical Physics” in
fall 2014 I presented my research to make precise the relation between the super
symmetric non-linear sigma model and super Riemann surfaces. The present paper
is a written up version of that talk.
The ﬁrst chapter gives a brief introduction to the necessary parts of super
geometry. We focus mainly on the local theory, that is the building block Rmjn.
Motivation is given by a toy example.
In the second section we will see how super Riemann surfaces can be reduced to
Riemann surfaces with an additional gravitino ﬁeld. A possible super Teichmüller
theory is discussed.
In the third section, the extension of the classical harmonic action functional
to super Riemann surfaces is given. Using the results of the second section it is
possible to formulate the super harmonic action functional as an integral over a
two-dimensional manifold. Symmetries of the action functional can be explained
with the help of the geometry of super Riemann surfaces. In analogy to the case of

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
403
Riemann surfaces, it is expected that the super harmonic action functional may help
to understand super Teichmüller space.

Super Geometry
The theory of super manifolds was developed in the 1970s and 1980s in order
to provide a geometrical framework for super symmetric theories in high-energy
physics. Already at that time two different approaches were developed. One
approach is to extend the deﬁnition of manifolds in terms of charts by replacing the
real numbers by certain Grassmann algebras, see e.g. [23]. The other approach is
inspired by algebraic geometry. It puts emphasis on functions rather than on points.
An early overview article for this approach is [20]. It is proven in [1] that both
approaches coincide. We will use here the algebraic approach to super manifolds
and certain generalizations given below.
Example 1.1 We will motivate and illustrate most deﬁnitions in this section by help
of the following toy model, inspired by [5, §1.3]. Let ' and  (classical) ﬁelds on
R. The main motivation for super geometry is to unify ' and  into one object
ˆ D ' C  
(1)
and to be able to interpret super symmetry, i.e. transformations of the following type
ı' D q 
ı D q@x'
(2)
in a geometric way. To this end one needs to extend the geometrical setting from the
domain R to R1j1, where the objects ˆ,  and the super symmetry transformations
get a precise meaning.
Recall that a locally ringed space M is a pair .kMk; OM/, where kMk is a
topological space and OM a sheaf of rings on M, see [12, §0.4]. Sections of OM
are called functions. A homomorphism of ringed spaces 'W M ! N is a pair
' D .k'k; '#/ consisting of a homomorphism k'kW kMk ! kNk of the underlying
topological spaces and a sheaf homomorphism '#W ON ! OM over '.
Deﬁnition 1.2 We denote by Rmjn the ringed space given by the topological space
Rm together with the sheaf of functions
ORmjn D C1.Rm; R/ ˝ ƒn
where ƒn is a real Grassmann algebra in n generators. A super manifold M is
a ringed space which is locally isomorphic to Rmjn. We say that M has m even
and n odd dimensions, or that M is of dimension mjn. A homomorphism of super
manifolds 'W M ! N is a homomorphism of locally ringed spaces.

404
E. Keßler
Let x1; : : : ; xm be the standard coordinate functions on Rm and 1; : : : ; n generators
of the Grassmann algebra ƒn. We call the tuple .XA/ D .xa; ˛/ of functions on Rmjn
coordinates of Rmjn. Any function f 2 ORmjn can be expressed as a ﬁnite expansion
in the odd coordinates ˛:
f D
X

f.x/ D f0 C ˛f˛ C : : :
Here the summation runs over all odd multiindices . The functions f are ordinary
functions on Rm.
Notice that ORmjn inherits a Z2 grading from the Grassmann algebra ƒn. We
will call elements of ORmjn of parity 0 even and elements of parity 1 odd. We use
here and in the following the convention, that small roman letters are used for even
objects, small greek letters for odd objects and capital letters for even and odd
objects together.
In contrast to the theory of manifolds, not every function f 2 ORmjn can be seen
as a map Rmjn ! R. This is a consequence of the graduation of the structure sheaf
ORnjm. By [20, Theorem 2.17], maps between super domains U  Rmjn and V 
Rpjq can be given in terms of coordinates.
Example 1.3 A ﬁrst possible interpretation for Eq. (1) would be that
ˆ D ' C  
is a function on R1j1 with coordinates .x; /. This would however restrict ' and  
to be smooth functions on R. Even though it looks like a drawback at ﬁrst sight, the
correct way is to consider maps ˆW R1j1 ! R. Let r be a coordinate function on R.
The map ˆ is then completely determined by the pullback ˆ#r which is an even
function on R1j1 because the ring homomorphisms ˆ# preserve automatically the
Z2-parity of the functions:
ˆ#r D '.x/ C  .x/
However, if ˆ#r is even the function  .x/ has to be zero. For the applications
we have in mind  .x/ is certainly expected to be non-zero. Therefore we need to
consider a family of maps ˆ parametrized by a super manifold B, i.e. a map that
makes the following diagram commutative:
R1|1 × B
R × B
B
Φ
pB
pB

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
405
Such a map is again completely determined by the pullback ˆ#r which is this
time an even function on R1j1  B:
ˆ#r D '.x/ C  .x/
Here the coefﬁcients functions '.x/ and  .x/ are functions on R1j0B. We suppress
the B-dependence in the notation. As ˆ#r is even, and  is odd, also  .x/ has to be
odd. This is possible if the base B possesses odd dimensions.
The Example 1.3 motivates the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 1.4 ([20]) A submersion pMW M ! B of super manifolds is also called a
family of super manifolds over B. A morphism f of families of super manifolds from
pMW M ! B to pNW N ! B is a morphism fW M ! N such that pN ı f D pM. Any
super manifold is a family over R0j0 D .fptg; R/. Any family is locally a projection
Rmjn  B ! B. We call mjn the dimension of the family.
According to [6, Remark 2.6.(v)] it is not necessary to ﬁx B. However B is always
supposed to be “big enough”, see Example 1.3. Henceforth, all super manifolds
and maps of super manifolds are implicitly to be understood as families of super
manifolds and morphisms of families of super manifolds. In particular, also Rmjn is
to be understood as the trivial family Rmjn  B.
Remark 1.5 Another quite popular approach to super manifolds is to use the functor
of points. Full discussions of this approach can be found in [24]. An advantage of
this approach is that one can treat inﬁnite dimensional super manifolds. Inﬁnite
dimensional manifolds can not be treated in the ringed-space approach. However
non-trivial families of super manifolds are usually not in the scope of the functor of
points approach. We will see in the next chapter, that we need non-trivial families
of super manifolds for the study of moduli spaces.
It is possible to extend a large part of differential geometry to super manifolds,
see e.g. [3, 6, 20]. In particular there are appropriate deﬁnitions of vector bundles,
tangent bundles, Lie groups and principle bundles.
Example 1.6 Let .xa; ˛/ be coordinates for Rmjn. Any vector ﬁeld V on Rmjn are
ORmjn-linear combination of the partial derivatives in coordinate directions:
V D Va@xa C V˛@˛
A particular vector ﬁeld on R1j1 is given by the even vector ﬁeld Q D q

@  @x

.
It acts on the function ˆ#r by
Qˆ#r D q

@  @x

.'.x/ C  .x// D q .x/ C q@x'
The coefﬁcients of Qˆ#r reproduce the super symmetry transformations from
Eq. (2). Consequently, the inﬁnitesimal super diffeomorphism given by the vector
ﬁeld Q can be identiﬁed with the super symmetry transformations (2).

406
E. Keßler
In order to study the relation between super manifolds and ordinary manifolds,
we need the concept of an underlying even manifold.
Deﬁnition 1.7 ([16]) Let M D .kMk; OM/ be a family of super manifolds of
dimension mjn over B. A family of super manifolds jMj D .kMk; OjMj/ of
dimension mj0 together with an embedding of families of super manifolds iW jMj !
M that is the identity on the underlying topological space is called an underlying
even manifold.
In [16] we have shown that such underlying even manifolds always exist. They are
unique, however, only if the odd dimension of B is zero.
Example 1.8 Remember that we have deﬁned the ﬁelds '.x/ and  .x/ as coefﬁ-
cients in the coordinate expansion of
ˆ#r D '.x/ C  .x/
with respect to ﬁxed coordinates .x; /, see Example 1.3. This deﬁnition is clearly
coordinate dependent. A general coordinate change on R1j1 (over B) is given by
x D g0.Qx/ C Qg1.Qx/
 D 0.Qx/ C Q1.Qx/
In the coordinates .Qx; Q/ the map ˆ is given by
ˆ#r D '.g0.Qx// C 0.Qx/ .g0.Qx// C Q
d'
dx .g0.Qx//g1.Qx/ C 1.Qx/ .g0.Qx//

With the help of a chosen embedding iW R1j0  B ! R1j1  B we are able to give a
coordinate independent deﬁnition of ' and  . Let y be the standard coordinate on
R1j0 and .x; / the standard coordinates on R1j1. Any embedding i can be expressed
in those coordinates as:
i#x D y
i# D 
for some odd function 
 in OR1j0B. At this point it is obvious why the embedding
is unique if B D R0j0.
The automorphism of R1j1  B given by
Qx D x
Q D   
yields i# Q D 0.
Deﬁne the ﬁeld ' D ˆ ı iW R1j0 ! R. One can assume without loss of generality
that the embedding i is given by i# D 0. Then the degree zero coefﬁcient of ˆ#r
coincides with ':
ˆ#r D '.x/ C f1.x/

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
407
Note that the choice of i ﬁxes only one component ﬁeld. Any coordinate change
x D Qx C Qg1.Qx/
 D Qx C Q1.Qx/
preserves '.x/, but not  . Any given embedding i splits all super diffeomorphisms
of R1j1 (Eq. (1)) into diffeomorphisms of R1j0 (given by g0), diffeomorphisms of
R1j1 that preserve i (given by g1 and 1), and diffeomorphisms of R1j1 that change i
(given by 0).
We deﬁne the second component ﬁeld  with the help of the vector ﬁeld D D
@ C @x. The vector ﬁeld D is characterized by the property that it commutes with
the super symmetry vector ﬁeld Q given in Example 1.6. The deﬁnition  D iDˆ
then assures that  is the super partner to ', because the action of the vector ﬁeld Q
on the component ﬁelds is given by
ı' D iQˆ D q 
ı D iQDˆ D q@x'
The deﬁnition of  given here shows that  is a section of 'TR and is independent
of the chosen coordinates. The vector ﬁeld D encountered here is crucial for the
deﬁnition of super Riemann surfaces in the next chapter. The particular structure of
super Riemann surfaces will then also assure that, contrary to our toy model here,
 is a spinor.
Integrals over a super manifold M can be reduced to integrals over jMj via an
embedding iW jMj ! M. Integration is deﬁned for sections of Ber T_M, a gener-
alization of the determinant line bundle. Integration is given in local coordinates
.xa; ˛/ such that i#˛ D 0 by

Rmj0 gtop.x/ dx1 : : : dxm
where gtop is the coefﬁcient of 1      n in the coordinate expansion of g.
Example 1.9 In our toy model, a super symmetric action for the ﬁelds ' and  is
given by
A.';  / D 1
2
Z
R
'02 C   0 dx
The action A.';  / can be formulated in terms of super symmetry via an integral
over R1j1 where the integrand depends on ˆ as follows:
A.';  / D A.ˆ/ D 1

Z
R1j1 @xˆDˆŒdx d
Note that the reduction of the integral over R1j1 to an integral over R is given with
respect to i. However the deﬁnition of A.ˆ/ does not depend on i. Consequently

408
E. Keßler
the integral A.ˆ/ has an additional symmetry, the change of embedding i. An
inﬁnitesimal change of embedding i is given by the even vector ﬁeld Q D

. The super symmetry of A.';  / can thus be interpreted geometrically,
in terms of a change of embedding of the underlying even manifold.

Super Riemann Surfaces
Super Riemann surfaces are 2j2-dimensional super manifolds with additional
structure. They appeared in the 1980s in the context of string theory and super
gravity. Early references are [10, 11, 19, 22]. We will see in this section how they can
be considered as a generalization of classical Riemann surfaces and give an outlook
to a possible super Teichmüller theory.
Let us recall, that there are several different ways to deﬁne and study Riemann
surfaces. From the viewpoint of complex geometry, Riemann surfaces are 1-
dimensional complex manifolds.
In differential geometry one can describe Riemann surfaces as two-dimensional
(real) manifolds with additional geometric structure, given by a conformal class
of metrics or an almost complex structure. Let jMj be a two-dimensional smooth
manifold of genus p. Let furthermore g and Qg be two Riemannian metrics on jMj.
Recall that the metrics g and Qg belong to the same conformal class Œg if there is
a positive function ƒ such that g D ƒQg. In two dimensions, a conformal class of
metrics together with an orientation induces an almost complex structure I by
g.IX; Y/ D dvolg.X; Y/
for all vector ﬁelds X and Y. It is also particular to the two-dimensional case that
this almost complex structure is always integrable, i.e. leads to a complex manifold.
Let fW jMj ! jMj be a diffeomorphism.The metric spaces .jMj; g/ and .jMj; f g/
are isometric. Consequently the resulting Riemann surfaces are isomorphic and iso-
morphism classes of Riemann surfaces are described by the quotient of conformal
classes up to diffeomorphisms:
Mp D fconformal classes Œg on jMjg = DiffjMj
(3)
Unfortunately the isomorphism classes of Riemann surfaces cannot be endowed
with a manifold structure. However, an inﬁnite cover of this space can be equipped
with a manifold structure, the Teichmüller space:
Tp D fconformal classes Œg on jMjg = Diff0 jMj
(4)
Here Diff0 jMj denotes diffeomorphisms of jMj that are homotopic to the identity. It
is a theorem due to Oswald Teichmüller, that the Teichmüller space Tp is isomorphic
to R6p6.

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
409
Inﬁnitesimal deformations of a given Riemann surface .jMj; g/ are tangent
vectors to the appropriate point in Teichmüller space. Since Riemann surfaces
are described here in terms of Riemannian metrics, inﬁnitesimal deformations
of Riemann surfaces are given by inﬁnitesimal changes ıg of the metric g.
Any inﬁnitesimal change of the metric ıg can be decomposed into inﬁnitesimal
conformal rescaling, Lie derivative of g (inﬁnitesimal diffeomorphism) and “true
inﬁnitesimal deformations” of the Riemann surface:
ıg D g C LXg C D
(5)
It can be shown that the true inﬁnitesimal deformations D are holomorphic quadratic
differentials, i.e. holomorphic sections of T_jMj ˝C T_jMj.
Super Riemann surfaces can also be described and studied with more algebraic
or more differential geometric methods. After a brief look at the algebraic deﬁnition
of super Riemann surfaces and its consequences we will turn to a more differential
geometric treatment of super Riemann surfaces. We will see that the differential
geometric picture allows to describe a super Riemann surface M in terms of a metric
g, a spinor bundle S, and a gravitino ﬁeld  on an underlying even manifold jMj.
This is a precise version of a conjecture to be found in [8, 15].
We use here the algebraic deﬁnition of super Riemann surfaces given in [19, 22].
Deﬁnition 2.1 A super Riemann surface is a 1j1-dimensional complex super
manifold M with a 0j1-dimensional distribution D  TM such that the commutator
of vector ﬁelds induces an isomorphism
1
2Œ; W D ˝C D ! TM=D:
Example 2.2 Let .z; / be the standard coordinates on C1j1 and deﬁne D  TC1j1
by D D h@ C @zi. The isomorphism D ˝ D ' TM=D is explicitly given by
Œ@ C @z; @ C @z D 2@z
This example is generic since any super Riemann surface is locally of this form,
see [19, Lemma 1.2].
The following proposition is an easy consequence of this deﬁnition:
Proposition 2.3 (see e.g. [24, Proposition 4.2.2]) There exists a bijection between
the set of super Riemann surfaces over R0j0 and the set of pairs .jMj; S/, where S is
a spinor bundle over the Riemann surface jMj, i.e. S ˝C S D TjMj.
Proof As indicated in the Example 2.2, the super Riemann surface M can be covered
by coordinate charts .z; / such that the holomorphic line bundle D is generated by

410
E. Keßler
@ C@z. Suppose .z; / and .Qz; Q/ are two pairs of such coordinates. In the formula
for the holomorphic change of coordinates
Qz D f.z/
Q D g.z/
(6)
the holomorphic functions f.z/ and g.z/ are related by the condition that @Q C Q@Qz
must be proportional to @ C @z. One can check that
@ C @z D g.z/

@Q C Q@Qz

if and only if f 0.z/ D g.z/2. As the unique underlying even manifold is given by
 D 0, the coordinates z induce a complex structure on jMj. The functions g.z/ can
be used as patching functions for a line bundle S such that S ˝C S D TjMj. As
explained before, a complex structure on a two-dimensional manifold corresponds
to a conformal class of metrics Œg. It can be shown that complex line bundles S such
that S ˝C S D TjMj are spinor bundles associated to a spin structure to any metric
g in the conformal class.
ut
The Proposition 2.3 shows that super Riemann surfaces over R0j0 are in one
to one correspondence to Riemann surfaces with spinor bundles. For non-trivial
families of super Riemann surfaces M ! B the proof of Proposition 2.3 fails
because the change of variables formula (6) can get more complicated in the
presence of odd dimensions in the base B (see [4]). We will see below that the
additional information of a spinor valued differential form  is needed to describe
non-trivial families of super Riemann surfaces.
It was furthermore shown in [19, 24, Theorem 8.4.4] that there is a semi-universal
family E ! ST p of super Riemann surfaces of genus p. That is any family M ! B
of super Riemann surfaces can be obtained in a non-unique way as a pullback of E
along a map B ! ST p. The base manifold ST p is a super manifold over R0j0 of
real dimension 6p  6j4p  4. Proposition 2.3 proves that the points of jST pj, i.e.
maps R0j0 ! ST p, are in one to one correspondence to Riemann surfaces with a
chosen spinor bundle. The super structure of ST p is encoded in non-trivial families
of super Riemann surfaces. In order to study non-trivial families of super Riemann
surfaces we will turn to a more differential geometric description of super Riemann
surfaces:
Theorem 2.4 ([11]) A super Riemann surface is a 2j2-dimensional real super
manifold with a reduction of the structure group of its frame bundle to
G D
A2 B
0 A
ˇˇˇˇA; B 2 C

 GLC.1j1/  GLR.2j2/
together with suitable integrability conditions. Remember that C is to be understood
as the trivial family C  B.

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
411
Theorem 2.4 is also interesting for the physical motivation of super Riemann
surfaces. It was shown in [11] that the integrability conditions of Theorem 2.4 are
related to the so-called “Torsion-constraints” that can be found in more physics-
oriented papers as [7, 8]. For a more recent approach via connections on super
manifolds and their torsion consult [18, 21].
The Theorem 2.4 shows that it is impossible to describe the geometry of super
Riemann surfaces as a super conformal class of super metrics. Any orthogonal
matrix that is upper triangular would indeed be diagonal. Consequently O.2j2/ ª G,
i.e. the choice of a super metric is not sufﬁcient to determine a super Riemann
surfaces. However there are particular super metrics that are compatible with the
structure of a super Riemann surface. They are given by further reduction to U.1/

The construction given here associates to any super Riemann surface M with
additional U.1/-structure a triple .g; S; / that consists of a metric g, a spinor bundle
S and a gravitino ﬁeld  on the underlying surface jMj. Different choices of U.1/-
structure on the same super Riemann surface lead to metrics and gravitinos which
differ from g and  only by a conformal and super Weyl transformation. A super
Weyl transformation is a transformation of the gravitino given by
.v/ 7! .v/ C .v/t
Here t is a section of S and W TjMj ! End.S/ is Clifford multiplication and v a
tangent vector ﬁeld to jMj.
It is surprising that the metric g, the spinor bundle S and the gravitino 
contain full information about the super Riemann surface M. Indeed, it was shown
in [16] that the super Riemann surface M and the embedding iW jMj ! M can be
reconstructed from the metric, the spinor bundle and the gravitino. Thus there is a
bijection
fiW jMj ! M; M super Riemann surfaceg
 ! fjMj; S; g; g =Weyl, SWeyl:
The metric g and the gravitino  do explicitly depend on the embedding i. The
normal bundle to the embedding iW jMj ! M is S D iD. Thus an inﬁnitesimal
deformation of the embedding i is given by a section q of S. The resulting
inﬁnitesimal change of metric and gravitino is given by (c.f. [16]):
ıfa D 2hbq; . fa/ifb
ıa D rS
faq D rLC
fa q C hbb; ai12q
(8)
Here the metric is expressed in terms of an orthonormal frame fa and the gravitino
in components a D . fa/. The spinor covariant derivative rLC is the Levi-Civita
connection lifted to S. Equations (8) are known as super symmetry transformations
of the metric and gravitino and will be a symmetry of the action functional
A.'; g;  ; ; F/ below. Furthermore one can show that it is possible to choose an
embedding i such that the gravitino vanishes around a given point p 2 jMj. If M is
a trivial family of super Riemann surfaces it is possible to choose an embedding i
such that the gravitino vanishes on the whole of jMj.
Having a description of super Riemann surfaces in terms of metrics and
gravitinos, it is natural to ask for a description of the super moduli space in terms
of metrics and gravitinos. Conjectures about such a super Teichmüller space can be
found in the literature, see e.g. [8, 15, Equation 3.85]. It is expected that there is a
one-to-one correspondence

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
413
fM; M super Riemann surfaceg = SDiff.M/
 !
fjMj; S; g; g =Weyl, SWeyl, Diff.jMj/; SUSY
(9)
The group of super symmetry transformations SUSY on the right hand side can
probably be identiﬁed with the change of embedding i. A precise deﬁnition of SUSY
and the study of the full quotient must be left for further research. A particularly
interesting question is, how the quotient by SUSY is related to the nonprojectedness
of the super moduli space (see [9]).
However it is possible to study an inﬁnitesimal version of the quotient (9). That
is inﬁnitesimal deformations of super Riemann surfaces can be studied in terms of
inﬁnitesimal deformations of metrics and gravitino. Similar to Eq.(5) it is possible
to decompose the inﬁnitesimal deformations
ıg D g C LXg C susy.q/ C D
ı D t C LX C susy.q/ C D
Here susy.q/ denotes the inﬁnitesimal super symmetry transformations from Eq. (8).
g is the inﬁnitesimal Weyl transformation and t the inﬁnitesimal super Weyl
transformation. It is possible to determine the free parameters , t, X, and q such
that the remaining “true deformations” D and D are holomorphic sections of
T_jMj ˝C T_jMj and S_ ˝C S_ ˝C S_ respectively. More precisely one has the
following:
Theorem 2.5 ([16]) Let M be the super Riemann surface given by g, S and  under
the embedding iW jMj ! M. The inﬁnitesimal deformations of M are given by
H0.T_jMj ˝C T_jMj/ ˚ H0.S_ ˝C S_ ˝C S_/
Here H0 denotes holomorphic sections.
This result is well-known (see e.g. [24] and references therein). However, the
approach outlined here gives a much more geometrical description of the even
and odd inﬁnitesimal deformations as inﬁnitesimal deformations of the metric and
gravitino, respectively.

Action Functional
In this chapter we are investigating a super symmetric extension of the harmonic
action functional on Riemann surfaces. This non-linear super symmetric sigma
model can be formulated as an integral over a super Riemann surface and may help,

414
E. Keßler
like the harmonic action functional on Riemann surfaces, to understand the moduli
space of super Riemann surfaces.
Let us ﬁrst recall how the harmonic action functional on Riemann surfaces can be
used as a tool to study the Teichmüller space. Details can be found in [13, 14]. Let
'W jMj ! N be a smooth map from the Riemann surface .jMj; g/ to the Riemannian
manifold .N; n/. The harmonic action functional as a functional of the metric g and
the map ' is given by
A.g; '/ D
Z
jMj
k d'k2
g_˝'n dvolg
(10)
The maps ' which are critical points of A.g; '/ are called harmonic maps.
In the case of two dimensional domains, as considered here, the action is
conformally invariant, i.e. A.ƒg; '/ D A.g; '/. The action functional A.g; '/ can
thus be considered as a functional on the conformal class of metrics. Furthermore it
is diffeomorphism invariant, i.e. for any diffeomorphism fW jMj ! jMj
A. f g; ' ı f/ D A.g; '/
The harmonic action functional can thus be viewed as a functional on isomorphism
classes of Riemann surfaces in the sense of Eq. (3) and also on the Teichmüller
space, see Eq. (4).
Deﬁne the energy-momentum tensor as the variation of A.g; '/ with respect to
the metric g:
ıgA.g; '/ D
Z
jMj
ıg  T dvolg
(11)
For a harmonic map ' the energy-momentum-tensor is the Noether current that
corresponds to diffeomorphism invariance. Inﬁnitesimal conformal rescalings ıg D
g and Lie-derivatives ıg D LXg must lie in the kernel of the variation ıgA.
The vanishing of ıgA on inﬁnitesimal conformal rescalings and Lie-derivatives is
sufﬁcient to show that the energy-momentum tensor T can be identiﬁed with a
holomorphic quadratic differential.
The preceding facts are particularly interesting in the case where the codomain
.N; n/ is also a Riemann surface. Let us assume that the genus of Riemann surfaces
jMj and N is strictly larger than one. It is possible to assume that the metrics g
and n have constant curvature 1. If, furthermore, the Riemann surfaces .jMj; g/
and .N; n/ are of the same genus p there is a unique harmonic map 'W jMj ! N
homotopic to the identity (see [14, Corollary 3.10.1]). The energy-momentum-
tensor T gives a map
Tp ! jMj.T_jMj ˝C T_jMj/
(12)

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
415
sending the Riemann surface .N; n/ to the holomorphic quadratic differential T
associated to '. The Teichmüller theorem [14, Thm 4.2.2] states that the above
map (12) is a diffeomorphism. The theorem of Riemann-Roch shows that the right-
hand side of (12), is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space isomorphic to C3p3 ' R6p6.
Summing up, we have seen that the harmonic action functional and harmonic
maps help to prove fundamental results in the theory of Teichmüller space.
Furthermore, as is shown in [13], harmonic maps are also useful to study a quantized
version of the harmonic action functional. We now present the outline of a similar
theory in the case of super Riemann surfaces.
Let M be a super Riemann surface with a ﬁxed U.1/-structure and local U.1/-
frames FA. Let ˆW M ! N be a map to an arbitrary Riemannian (super) manifold
.N; n/. The super symmetric extension of the harmonic action functional (10) is
given by
A.M; ˆ/ D
Z
M
k dˆjD k2Œdvol D
Z
M
"˛ˇhF˛ˆ; FˇˆiˆnŒF1F2F3F4
(13)
At a ﬁrst glance this action functional looks just like the harmonic action func-
tional (10). However notice that the norm of the differential dˆ restricted to D is
used. This difference to the harmonic action functional is crucial to show that the
action functional ((13)) does only depend on the underlying G-structure and not on
the chosen U.1/-structure. This analogue of conformal invariance, together with the
super diffeomorphism invariance of A.M; ˆ/ turns A.M; ˆ/ into a functional on the
moduli space of super Riemann surfaces as in the left-hand side of Eq. (9).
The action functional ((13)) can be found at different places in the literature, see
for example [8, 11]. In [11] the super conformal invariance of the action functional
A.M; ˆ/ is shown.
The maps ˆ that are critical with respect to A.M; ˆ/ are described by a
differential equation of second order:
0 D Dˆ D "˛ˇrF˛Fˇˆ C "˛ˇ .div F˛/ Fˇˆ
(14)
Analytical properties of the D-Laplace operator D, deﬁned here, still need to be
studied. Remember that a detailed understanding of the analysis of harmonic maps
is crucial for the deﬁnition of the Teichmüller map (12). In [16] it was shown that
Eq. (14) can be used to derive equations of motion for the component ﬁelds deﬁned
below in Deﬁnition 3.1.
Let now iW jMj ! M be an underlying even manifold for M. We have seen in the
last section that the super Riemann surface M can be described in terms of a metric
ﬁeld g and a gravitino ﬁeld . As explained in the ﬁrst section, every integral over
a super manifold can be reduced to an integral over the underlying even manifold.
Let us denote the resulting Lagrangian density on jMj by jLj, i.e.:
A.M; ˆ/ D
Z
jMj
jLj

416
E. Keßler
Of course the Lagrangian density jLj depends not only on g and , but also on
ˆ. In order to express this dependence in a geometric way, we will now introduce
component ﬁelds for ˆ.
Deﬁnition 3.1 Let ˆW M ! N be a morphism and iW jMj ! M be an underlying
even manifold. We call the ﬁelds
'W jMj ! N
 W jMj ! S_ ˝ 'TN
FW jMj ! 'TN
' D ˆ ı i
 D s˛ ˝ iF˛ˆ
F D iDˆ
component ﬁelds of ˆ. The vectors s˛ form the dual basis to the basis s˛ D iF˛ of
the spinor bundle S D iD on jMj.
The component ﬁelds are sufﬁcient to fully determine the map ˆ. There are
particular coordinates .xa; ˛/ on M such that in the case N D R the map ˆ can
be written as
ˆ#r D ' C 	 	 C 12F
This expansion is similar to the Example 1.8. It is an advantage of the geometric
deﬁnition of the component ﬁelds ',  and F, used here, to apply for arbitrary
target manifolds N.
With the help of the component maps ',  and F, as well as g and , the
Lagrangian density jLj can be calculated explicitly. For details on the rather long
computations, see the forthcoming thesis [17]. Note that the reduction of the
action functional A.M; ˆ/ to the action functional A.'; g;  ; ; F/ given below
was claimed in the literature almost 30 years ago (see, for example, [8]). This
reduction served as a major motivation for the introduction of super Riemann
surfaces, as supposedly the action functional A.M; ˆ/ would be easier to study than
the component action A.'; g;  ; ; F/. However, no proof of the reduction could be
found in the literature.
Theorem 3.2 Let M be a super Riemann surface and iW jMj ! M an underlying
even manifold. We denote by g, , and gS respectively the metric, gravitino, and
spinor metric on jMj induced by a given U.1/-structure on M. Let ˆW M ! N be a
morphism to a super Riemannian manifold .N; n/ and ',  , and F its component
ﬁelds, as introduced in Deﬁnition 3.1. One obtains

Super Riemann Surfaces and Super Conformal Action Functional
417
Notice that the symmetries of A.M; ˆ/ translate into several symmetries for
A.'; g;  ; ; F/. The G-invariance of the action A.M; ˆ/ leads to conformal and
super Weyl invariance of A.'; g;  ; ; F/. The invariance of A.M; ˆ/ under super
diffeomorphisms splits into diffeomorphism invariance and super symmetry of
A.'; g;  ; ; F/. Super symmetry of A.'; g;  ; ; F/ is the invariance up to ﬁrst
order under an inﬁnitesimal change of the embedding i parametrized by the spinor
q. The formulas for the super symmetry between g and  have been given in Eq. (8).
A full calculation for the super symmetry of ',  and F can be found in [17]. We
give here the resulting formulas for the special case F D 0 and RN D 0:
ı' D hq;  i
ı D .@xk'  h ; ki/ kq
We have thus given a super geometric explanation to all symmetries of the action
functional A.'; g;  ; ; F/ appearing in the literature (e.g. [2, 7]).
We now turn to applications of the action functional A.M; ˆ/ to the super moduli
space or super Teichmüller space. Similar to the case of Riemann surfaces and
the harmonic action functional, the action functional A.M; ˆ/ can be seen as a
functional on the super moduli space. By the left hand side of Eq. (9) the super
moduli space is given by the integrable G-structures up to super diffeomorphisms.
The action functional ((13)) depends explicitly on the G-structure and is super
diffeomorphism invariant. Thus one may expect that the action functional (13) and
its critical points—the maps ˆW M ! N solving Eq. (14)—may be useful to study
the super moduli space. However certain difﬁculties arise from the presence of
integrability conditions in Theorem 2.4. Let H be an inﬁnitesimal variation of the
G-frame FA, i.e. ﬁrst derivative of a family of frames
F.t/A D FA C tHB
AFB C o.t/:
If the family of frames F.t/A is a family of integrable G-frames, certain inﬁnitesimal
integrability conditions hold for H. Consequently, the H that do not fulﬁl those
inﬁnitesimal integrability conditions are not admissible inﬁnitesimal deformations
of the super Riemann surface deﬁned by FA.
The variation of the action functional ((13)) with respect to the variation of the
frames FA can be written as
ıFAA.M; ˆ/ D
Z
M
H  TsuperŒdvol
(15)
The tensor Tsuper can be seen as a super version of the energy-momentum-tensor in
Eq. (11). However it is not guaranteed that non-integrableinﬁnitesimal deformations
H lie in the kernel of the variation ıFAA.M; ˆ/. Thus, in contrast to the case of
Riemann surfaces, ıFAA.M; ˆ/ can not be interpreted as a cotangent vector to the
moduli space of super Riemann surfaces.
In order to circumvent the problem of integrability conditions one can turn to a
description of the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces in terms of metrics and

418
E. Keßler
gravitinos, i.e. to the right hand side of Eq. (9). It is an advantage of the description
of super Riemann surfaces in terms of metrics and gravitinos that there are no
integrability conditions, i.e. every triple .g; S; / forms a super Riemann surface.
Thus every deformation of the given metric and given gravitino is an admissible
deformation of the super Riemann surface at hand. Deﬁne the energy-momentum
tensor T of A.'; g;  ; ; F/ via
ıgA.'; g;  ; ; F/ D
Z
jMj
ıg  T dvolg
and the super current J by
ıA.'; g;  ; ; F/ D
Z
jMj
ı  J dvolg
If the ﬁelds ',  , and F are critical points of A.'; g;  ; ; F/, then T is the Noether
current with respect to diffeomorphism invariance, whereas J is the Noether current
with respect to super symmetry. It can be shown that T and J are components
of Tsuper similar to ',  and F being components of ˆ. Thus, once again,
diffeomorphism invariance and super symmetry are very much the same thing from
the viewpoint of super geometry. With the help of the diffeomorphism invariance
and super symmetry of A.'; g;  ; ; F/ one can show that T is, once again, a
holomorphic quadratic differential and J a holomorphic section of S_ ˝C S_ ˝C S_.
They are even, resp. odd tangent vectors to the moduli space of super Riemann
surfaces.
One can hope that the study of critical points of the action functional
A.'; g;  ; ; F/ turns out as useful for the study of the moduli space of super
Riemann surfaces as the study of harmonic maps is for Teichmüller theory.

deﬁnitions of star products and their equivalences both from a mathematical and
a physical point of view. Then we focus on two topics: the Morita classiﬁcation of

Introduction: A Historical Tour d’Horizon
In the last decades, deformation quantization evolved into a widely accepted
quantization scheme which, on one hand, provides deep conceptual insights into the
question of quantization and, on the other hand, proved to be a reliably technique
leading to explicit understanding of many examples. It will be the aim of this review
to give some overview on the developments of deformation quantization starting
from the beginnings but also including some more recent ideas.
The original formulations of deformation quantization by Bayen et. al. aimed
mainly at ﬁnite-dimensional classical mechanical systems described by symplectic
or Poisson manifolds [5] and axiomatized the heuristic quantization formulas found
earlier by Weyl, Groenewold and Moyal [56, 73, 89]. Berezin considered the more
particular case of bounded domains and Kähler manifolds [7–9]. Shortly after it
proved to be a valuable tool to approach also problems in quantum ﬁeld theories,
see e.g. the early works of Dito [41–43].
Meanwhile, the question of existence and classiﬁcation of deformation quanti-
zations, i.e. of star products, on symplectic manifolds was settled: ﬁrst DeWilde
and Lecomte showed the existence of star products on symplectic manifolds [39]
in 1983 after more particular classes [38, 40] had been considered. Remarkably,
also in 1983 the ﬁrst genuine class of Poisson structures was shown to admit star
products, the linear Poisson structures on the dual of a Lie algebra, by Gutt [57]
and Drinfel’d [47]. In 1986 Fedosov gave a very explicit and constructive way to
obtain star products on a symplectic manifold by means of a symplectic connection
[53], see also [54, 55] for a more detailed version. His construction is still one of the
cornerstones in deformation quantization as it provides not only a particularly nice
construction allowing to adjust many special features of star products depending
on the underlying manifold like e.g. separation of variables (Wick type) on Kähler
manifolds [14, 61, 62, 79] or star products on cotangent bundles [19–21]. Even
beyond the symplectic world, Fedosov’s construction was used to globalize the
existence proofs of star products on Poisson manifolds [36, 44].
Even though the symplectic case was understood well, the question of existence
on Poisson manifolds kept its secrets till the advent of Kontsevich’s formality
theorem, solving his formality conjecture [63, 64, 67]. To give an adequate overview
on Kontsevich’s formality theorem would clearly go beyond the scope of this short
review. Here one can rely on various other publications like e.g. [35, 52]. In a
nutshell, the formality theorem proves a very general fact about smooth functions on
a manifold from which it follows that every (formal series of) Poisson structures can
be quantized into a star product, including a classiﬁcation of star products. Parallel to
Kontsevich’s groundbreaking result, the classiﬁcation of star products on symplectic
manifolds was achieved and compared by several groups [10, 37, 58, 77, 78]. Shortly
after Kontsevich, Tamarkin gave yet another approach to the quantization problem
on Poisson manifolds [84], see also [65, 68], based on the language of operads
and the usage of Drinfel’d associators. Starting with these formulations, formality

theory has evolved and entered large areas of contemporary mathematics, see e.g.
[1–3, 45, 46, 65, 66] to name just a few.
While deformation quantization undoubtedly gave many important contribution
to pure mathematics over the last decades, it is now increasingly used in contem-
porary quantum physics as well: perhaps starting with the works of Dütsch and
Fredenhagen on the perturbative formulations of algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory
[49–51] it became clear that star products provide the right tool to formulate
quantum ﬁeld theories in a semiclassical way, i.e. as formal power series in „. Now
this has been done in increasing generalities for various scenarios including ﬁeld
theories on general globally hyperbolic spacetimes, see e.g. [4, 22, 23, 59].
Of course, from a physical point of view, deformation quantization can not yet
be the ﬁnal answer as one always deals with formal power series in the deformation
parameter „. A physically reasonable quantum theory, however, requires of course
convergence. Again, in the very early works [5] some special cases were treated,
namely the Weyl-Moyal product for which an integral formula exists which allows
for a reasonable analysis based on the Schwartz space. The aims here are at least
two-fold. On one hand one wants to establish a reasonable spectral calculus for
particular elements in the star product algebra which allows to compute spectra in
a physically sensitive way. This can be done with the star exponential formalism,
which works in particular examples but lacks a general framework. On the other
hand, one can try to establish form the formal star product a convergent version
such that in the end one obtains a C-algebra of quantum observables being a
deformation, now in a continuous way, of the classical functions on the phase
space. This is the point of view taken by strict deformation quantization, most
notably advocated by Rieffel [81, 82] and Landsman [70], see also [16, 30–33]
for the particular case of quantizable Kähler manifolds and [74–76] for more
general symplectic manifolds. Bieliavsky and coworkers found a generalization of
Rieffel’s approach by passing from actions of the abelian group Rd to more general
Lie group actions [11–13]. Having a C-algebra one has then the full power of
C-algebra techniques at hands which easily allows to get a reasonable spectral
calculus. However, constructing C-algebraic quantizations is still very much in
development: here one has not yet a clear picture on the existence and classiﬁcation
of the quantizations. In fact, one even has several competing deﬁnitions of what
one is looking for. It is one of the ongoing research projects by several groups to
understand the transition between formal and strict quantizations in more detail.
Needless to say, in the above historical survey we can barely scratch on the
surface of this vast topic: many aspects have not been mentioned like the role played
of symmetries and reduction, the applications to concrete physical systems, various
generalizations of deformation quantization to other geometric brackets, relations
to noncommutative geometry, and many more. In the remaining part of this review
we will focus on two aspects of the theory: ﬁrst, we discuss the role of classiﬁcation
results beyond the notion of equivalence, i.e. isomorphism. Here we are particularly
interested in the classiﬁcation of star products up to Morita equivalence. Second,
we give a short outlook on star products in inﬁnite dimensions and problems arising
there by investigating one particular example: the Weyl algebra of a vector space

with a (quite arbitrary) bilinear form. Beside the purely algebraic construction we
obtain a locally convex algebraic deformation once we start in this category.

From Poisson Manifolds to Star Products
In this section we give a more detailed but still non-technical motivation of the
deﬁnition of star products and list some ﬁrst examples.
The set-up will be a ﬁnite-dimensional phase space which we model by a
symplectic or, more generally, a Poisson manifold .M; / where  2 1.ƒ2TM/
is a bivector ﬁeld satisfying

identity for the Poisson bracket
f f; gg D   f;  ; g D .d f; d g/
(2)
determined by  for functions f; g 2 C 1.M/. One can then formulate classical
Hamiltonian mechanics using  and f  ;  g. For a gentle introduction to Poisson
geometry see [87] as well as [34, 48, 71, 85]. There are several important examples
of Poisson manifolds:
•
Every symplectic manifold .M; !/, where !
2
1.ƒ2TM/ is a closed
non-degenerate two-form, is a Poisson manifold with  D !1. The Jacobi
identity (1) corresponds then directly to d ! D 0.
•
Every cotangent bundle TQ is a symplectic manifold in a canonical way with
an exact symplectic form ! D d  where  2 1.T.TQ// is the canonical (or
tautological) one-form on TQ.
•
Kähler manifolds are particularly nice examples of symplectic manifolds as they
possess a compatible Riemannian metric and a compatible complex structure.
•
The dual g of a Lie algebra g is always a Poisson manifold with a linear Poisson
structure: the coefﬁcient functions of the tensor ﬁeld  are linear functions on
g, explicitly given by
f f; gg.x/ D xici

@g
@x` ;
(3)
where x1; : : : ; xn are the linear coordinates on g and ci
k` are the corresponding
structure constants of g. Since (3) vanishes at the origin, this is never symplectic.
•
Remarkably and slightly less trivial is the observation that on every manifold M,
for every p 2 M there is a Poisson structure  with compact support where 

has maximal rank.

To motivate the deﬁnition of a star product we consider the most easy example
of the classical phase space R2 with canonical coordinates .q; p/. Canonical
quantization says that we have to map the spacial coordinate q to the position
operator Q acting on a suitable domain in L2.R; d x/ as multiplication operator.
Moreover, we have to assign the momentum coordinate p to the momentum operator
P D i„ @
@q, again deﬁned on a suitable domain. Since we want to ignore functional-
analytic questions at the moment, we simply chose C1
0 .R/ as common domain for
both operators. In a next step we want to quantize polynomials in q and p as well.
Here we face the ordering problem as pq D qp but PQ ¤ QP. One simple choice is
the standard ordering
qnpm 7! %Std.qnpm/ D QnPm D .i„/mqn @m

for monomials and its linear extension to all polynomials. More explicitly, this gives

Now this formula still makes sense for smooth functions f which are polynomial
only in p, i.e. for f 2 C1.R/Œp. The main idea of deformation quantization is
now to pull-back the operator product: this is possible since the image of %Std is
the space of all differential operators with smooth coefﬁcients which therefore is a
(noncommutative) algebra. We deﬁne the standard-ordered star product by

as a simple integration by parts shows. We can repair this unpleasant feature by
deﬁning the Weyl ordering and the Weyl product by
%Weyl. f/ D %Std.Nf/
and
f ?Weyl g D N1.Nf ?Std Ng/:
(8)
Note that N is indeed an invertible operator on C1.R/Œp. Again, ?Weyl is associative.
Then we get
f ?Weyl g D g ?Weyl f
and
%Weyl. f ?Weyl g/ D %Weyl. f/%Weyl.g/:

For both products we can collect the terms of order „r which gives
f ? g D

with bidifferential operators Cr of order r in each argument. The explicit formula for
?Weyl is slightly more complicated than the one for ?Std in (6) and easily computed.
We have
f ? g D fg C   
and
f ? g  g ? f D i„f f; gg C    ;
(11)
where C    means higher orders in „. Also f ? 1 D f D 1 ? f. Note also that
the seemingly inﬁnite series in (10) is always ﬁnite as long as we take functions in
C1.R/Œp.
The idea is now to axiomatize these features for ? in such a way that it makes
sense to speak of a star product on a general Poisson manifold. The ﬁrst obstacle is
that on a generic manifold M there is nothing like functions which are polynomial
in certain coordinates. This is a chart-dependent characterization which one does
not want to use. But then already for ?Weyl and ?Std one encounters the problem that
for general f; g 2 C1.R2/ the formulas (6) and (9) will not make any sense: the
series are indeed inﬁnite and since we can adjust the Taylor coefﬁcients of a smooth
function in a rather nasty way, there is no hope for convergence. The way out is to
consider formal star product in a ﬁrst step, i.e. formal power series in „. This yields
the deﬁnition of star products [5]:
Deﬁnition 2.1 A formal star product ? on a Poisson manifold .M; / is an
associative CŒŒ„-bilinear associative product for C1.M/ŒŒ„ such that

3. Cr.1; f/ D 0 D Cr. f; 1/ for r  1,
4. Cr is a bidifferential operator.
Already in the trivial example above we have seen that there might be more
than one star product. The operator N interpolates between them and is invisible in
classical physics: for „ D 0 the operator N becomes the identity. As a formal series
of differential operators it is invertible and implements an algebra isomorphism.
This is now taken as deﬁnition for equivalence of star products: given two star
products ? and ?0 on a manifold, a formal power series T D P1
rD0 „rTr of
differential operators Tr with T1 D 1 is called an equivalence between ? and ?0

(13)
Note that T is indeed invertible as a formal power series. Hence this is an
equivalence relation. Conversely, given such a T and ? we get a new star product ?0
by (13).
We list now some basic examples of star products:
•
The explicit formulas for ?Std and ?Weyl immediately generalize to higher dimen-
sions yielding equivalent star products on R2n and hence also on every open
subset of R2n. Since by the Darboux Theorem every symplectic manifold looks
like an open subset of R2n locally, the question of existence of star products on
symplectic manifolds is a global problem.
•
For the linear Poisson structure (3) on the dual g of a Lie algebra g one gets
a star product as follows [57]: First, we note that the symmetric algebra S.g/
over g can be canonically identiﬁed with the polynomials Pol.g/ on the dual
g. Then the PBW isomorphism

(14)
from the symmetric algebra over g into the universal enveloping algebra allows
to pull the product of U.g/ back to S.g/ and hence to polynomials on g. One
can now show that after interpreting „ as a formal parameter one indeed obtains a
star product quantizing the linear Poisson bracket. This star product is completely
characterized by the feature that

The next interesting example is perhaps the complex projective space CPn and
its non-compact dual, the Poincaré disc Dn with their canonical Kähler structures
of constant holomorphic sectional curvature. For these, star products were
considered by Moreno and Ortega-Navarro [72] who gave recursive formulas
using local coordinates. Cahen, Gutt, and Rawnsley [30–33] discussed this in
their series of papers of quantization of Kähler manifolds as one of the examples.
The ﬁrst explicit (non-recursive) formula was found in [17, 18] by a quantization
of phase space reduction and extended to complex Grassmannians in [83]. Ever
since these star products have been re-discovered by various authors.
We brieﬂy comment on the general existence results: as already mentioned, the
symplectic case was settled in the early 1980s. The Poisson case follows from
Kontsevich’s formality theorem.
Theorem 2.2 (Kontsevich) On every Poisson manifold there exist star products.

Moreover, let X D „X1 C „2X2 C    2 „1.TM/ŒŒ„ be a formal vector ﬁeld,

Via the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series, the set of formal diffeomorphisms be-
comes a group and (17) is a group action. Since LX is a derivation of the Schouten
bracket, it follows that the action of exp.LX/ preserves formal Poisson structures.
The space of orbits of formal Poisson structures modulo this group action gives now
the classiﬁcation:
Theorem 2.3 (Kontsevich) The set of equivalence classes of formal star products
is in bijection to the set of equivalence classes of formal Poisson structures modulo
formal diffeomorphisms.
In general, both moduli spaces are extremely difﬁcult to describe. However, if
the ﬁrst order term 1 in  is symplectic, then we have a much easier description
which is in fact entirely topological:
Theorem 2.4 (Bertelson, Cahen, Gutt, Nest, Tsygan, Deligne, ...) On a sym-
plectic manifold .M; !/ the equivalence classes of star products are in bijection to
the formal series in the second deRham cohomology. In fact, one has a canonical
surjective map

(18)
such that ? and ?0 are equivalent iff c.?/ D c.?0/.
This map is now called the characteristic class of the symplectic star product.
In a sense which can be made very precise [29], the inverse of c.?/ corresponds to
Kontsevich’s classiﬁcation by formal Poisson tensors.

Morita Classiﬁcation
We come now to some more particular topics in deformation quantization. In this
section we discuss a coarser classiﬁcation result than the above classiﬁcation up to
equivalence.

Recent Developments in Deformation Quantization

The physical motivation to look for Morita theory is rather simple and obvious: in
quantum theory we can not solely rely on the observable algebra as the only object
of interest. Instead we also need to have a reasonable notion of states. While for C-
algebras there is a simple deﬁnition of a state as a normalized positive functional,
in deformation quantization we do not have C-algebras in a ﬁrst step. Surprisingly,
the notion of positive functionals still makes sense if interpreted in the sense of the
ring-ordering of RŒŒ„ and produces a physically reasonable deﬁnition of states, see
[15]. However, the requirements from quantum theory do not stop here: we also need
a super-position principle for states. Since positive functionals can only be added
convexly,we need to realize the positive functionals as expectation value functionals
for a -representation of the observable algebra on some (pre-) Hilbert space. Then
we can take complex linear combination of the corresponding vectors to implement
the super-position principle. This leads to the need to understand the representation
theory of the star product algebras, a program which was investigated in great detail
[24, 25, 27–29, 60], see also [86] for a review. The main point is that replacing the
ring of scalars from R to RŒŒ„ and thus from C to CŒŒ„ works surprisingly well as
long as we do not try to implement analytic concepts: the non-archimedean order of
RŒŒ„ forbids a reasonable analysis. However, the concept of positivity is entirely
algebraic and hence can be used and employed in this framework as well.
In fact, one does not need to stop here: any ordered ring R instead of R will do the
job and one can study -algebras over C D R.i/ and their -representation theory
on pre Hilbert modules over C. For many reasons it will also be advantageous to
consider representation spaces where the inner product is not taking values in the
scalars but in some auxiliary -algebra D.
Example Let E ! M be a complex vector bundle over a smooth manifold M.
Then 1.E/ is a C1.M/-module in the usual way. A Hermitian ﬁber metric h now
gives a sesquilinear map
h  ;  i W 1.E/  1.E/ ! C1.M/
(19)
which is also C1.M/-linear in the second argument, i.e. we have hs; tf i D hs; ti f
for all s; t 2 1.E/ and f 2 C1.M/. Moreover, the pointwise positivity of hp on Ep
implies that the map
h  ;  i.n/ W 1.E/n  1.E/n ! Mn.C1.M// D C1.M; Mn.C//
(20)
is positive for all n in the sense that the matrix-valued function hS; Si.n/
2
C1.M; Mn.C// yields a positive matrix at all points of M for all S D .s1; : : : ; sn/ 2
1.E/n.
Using this kind of complete positivity for an inner product yields the deﬁnition of
a pre Hilbert right module over a -algebra D, where the inner product takes values
in D. Then again, we can formulate what are -representations of a -algebra A
on such a pre Hilbert right module over D. Without further difﬁculties this gives

430
S. Waldmann
various categories of -representations of -algebras on inner product modules or
pre Hilbert modules over auxiliary -algebras.
Having a good notion of -representations of -algebras it is a major talks to
understand the resulting categories for those -algebras occurring in deformation
quantization. From C-algebra theory we anticipate that already with the full power
of functional-analytic techniques it will in general be impossible to “understand”
the category of -representations completely, beside rather trivial examples. The
reason is that there will simply be too many inequivalent such -representations and
a decomposition theory into irreducible ones is typically an extremely hard problem.
In a purely algebraic situation like for formal star product algebras, things are even
worse: here we expect even more inequivalent ones which are just artifacts of the
algebraic formulation. There are many examples of inequivalent -representations
which, after one implements mild notions of convergence and hence of analytic
aspects, become equivalent. From a physical point of view such inequivalences
would then be negligible. However, it seems to be quite difﬁcult to decide this before
convergence is implemented, i.e. on the algebraic side.
Is the whole program now useless, hopeless? The surprising news is that one
can indeed say something non-trivial about the -representation theories of the star
product algebras from deformation quantization, and for -algebras in general. The
idea is that even if the -representation of a given -algebra is horribly complicated
and contains maybe unwanted -representations, we can still compare the whole
-representation theory of one -algebra to another -algebra and ask whether they
are equivalent as categories.
This is now the basic task of Morita theory. To get a ﬁrst impression we
neglect the additional structure of ordered rings, -involutions, and positivity and
consider just associative algebras over a common ring of scalars. For two such
algebras A and B we want to know whether their categories of left modules are
equivalent categories. Now there might be many very strange functors implementing
an equivalence and hence one requires them to be compatible with direct sums of
modules, which is clearly a reasonable assumption. The prototype of such a functor
is then given by the tensor product with a .B; A/-bimodule. Since the tensor product
with A itself is (for unital algebras) naturally isomorphic to the identity functor and
since the tensor product of bimodules is associative up to a natural isomorphism,
the question of equivalence of categories via such tensor product functors becomes
equivalent to the question of invertible bimodules: Here a .B; A/-bimodule BE A is
called invertible if there is an .A; B/-bimodule
AE 0
B such that the tensor product
BE A ˝A AE 0
B is isomorphic to B and
AE 0
B ˝B BE A is isomorphic to A, always as
bimodules.
The classical theorem of Morita now gives a complete and fairly easy description
of the possible bimodules with this property:
BE A has to be a ﬁnitely generated
projective and full right A-module and B is isomorphic to EndA. E A/ via the left
module structure, see e.g. [69].
Now the question is how such bimodules look like for star product algebras.
Classically, the ﬁnitely generated projective modules over C1.M/ are, up to
isomorphism, just sections 1.E/ of a vector bundle E ! M. This is the

Recent Developments in Deformation Quantization
431
famous Serre-Swan theorem in its incarnation for differential geometry. As soon
as the ﬁber dimension is non-zero, the fullness condition is trivially satisﬁed. Hence
the only Morita equivalent algebras to C1.M/ are, again up to isomorphism, the
sections 1.End.E// of endomorphism bundles. The corresponding bimodule is
then 1.E/ on which both algebras act in the usual way. It now requires a little
argument to see that for star products, an equivalence bimodule gives an equivalence
bimodule in the classical limit „ D 0, i.e. a vector bundle. Conversely, the sections
of every vector bundle can be deformed into a right module over the star product
algebra in a unique way up to isomorphism. Thus for star products, we have to look
for the corresponding module endomorphisms of such deformed sections of vector
bundles. Finally, in order to get again a star product algebra, the endomorphisms of
the deformed sections have to be, in the classical limit, isomorphic to the functions
on a manifold again. This can only happen if the vector bundle was actually a line
bundle over the same manifold. Hence the remaining task is to actually compute the
star product of the algebra acting from the left side when the star product for the
algebra on the right side is known. Here one has the following results:
Theorem 3.1 (Bursztyn, W. [26]) Let .M; !/ and .M0; !0/ be a symplectic mani-
folds and let ?, ?0 be two star products on M and M0, respectively. Then ? and ?0
are Morita equivalent iff there exists a symplectomorphism  W M ! M0
 c.?0/  c.?/ 2 2iH2
dR.M; Z/:
(21)
The difference of the above classes deﬁnes then a line bundle which implements the
Morita equivalence bimodule by deforming its sections.
This theorem already has an important physical interpretation: for cotangent
bundles TQ the characteristic classes c.?/ can be interpreted as the classes of
magnetic ﬁelds B on the conﬁguration space Q. Then a quantization of a charged
particle in the background ﬁeld of such a B requires a star product with characteristic
class c.?/. Compared to the trivial characteristic class, c.?/ D 0, the above theorem
then tells that quantization with magnetic ﬁeld has the same representation theory
iff the magnetic ﬁeld satisﬁes the integrality condition for a Dirac monopole. Thus
we get a Morita theoretic interpretation of the charge quantization for magnetic
monopoles which is now extremely robust against details of the quantization
procedure: the statement holds for all cotangent bundles and for all equivalent star
products with the given characteristic class.
Also in the more general Poisson case the full classiﬁcation is known. Here the
actual statement is slightly more technical as it requires the Kontsevich class of
the star products and a canonically given action of the deRham cohomology on
equivalence classes of formal Poisson structures by gauge transformations. Then
one obtains the following statement:
Theorem 3.2 (Bursztyn, Dolgushev, W. [29]) Star products on Poisson manifolds
are Morita equivalent iff their Kontsevich classes of formal Poisson tensors are
gauge equivalent by a 2i-integral deRham class.

Beyond Formal Star Products
Since formal star products are clearly not sufﬁcient for physical purposes, one has to
go beyond formal power series. Here several options are available: on one hand one
can replace the formal series in the star products by integral formulas. The formal
series can then be seen as the asymptotic expansions of the integral formulas in the
sense of Taylor series of smooth functions of „, which are typically not analytic:
hence we cannot expect convergence. Nevertheless, the integral formulas allow for
a good analytic framework.
However, if one moves to ﬁeld theories and hence to inﬁnite-dimensional sys-
tems, quantization becomes much more complicated. Surprisingly, series formulas
for star products can still make sense in certain examples, quite unlike the integral
formulas: such integrals would consist of integrations over a inﬁnite-dimensional
phase space. Hence we know that such things can hardly exist in a mathematically
sound way.
This motivates the second alternative, namely to investigate the formal series in
the star products directly without integral formulas in the back. This might also be
possible in inﬁnite dimensions and yield reasonable quantizations there. While this
is a program far from being understood, we now present a class of examples with a
particular physical relevance: the Weyl algebra.
Here we consider a real vector space V with a bilinear map ƒW V  V ! C.
Then we consider the complexiﬁed symmetric algebra S
C.V/ of V and interpret this
as the polynomials on the dual V. In ﬁnite dimensions this is correct, in inﬁnite
dimensions the symmetric algebra is better to be interpreted as the polynomials
on the (not necessarily existing) pre-dual. On V, there are simply much more
polynomials than the ones arising from S
C.V/. Now we can extend ƒ to a
biderivation
PƒW S
C.V/ ˝ S
C.V/ ! S
C.V/ ˝ S
C.V/
(22)
in a unique way by enforcing the Leibniz rule in both tensor factors. If we denote
by 	W S
C.V/ ˝ S
C.V/ ! S
C.V/ the symmetric tensor product, then
fa; bgƒ D 	 ı .Pƒ.a ˝ b/  Pƒ.b ˝ a//
(23)
is a Poisson bracket. In fact, this is the unique constant Poisson bracket with the
property that for linear elements v; w 2 V we have fv; wg D ƒ.v; w/  ƒ.w; v/.
Hence the antisymmetric part of ƒ determines the bracket. However, we will use
the symmetric part for deﬁning the star product. This will allow to include also
standard-orderings or other orderings like Wick ordering from the beginning.
A star product quantizing this constant Poisson structure can then be found easily.
We set
a ? b D 	 ı exp.zPƒ/.a ˝ b/
(24)

433
where z 2 C is the deformation parameter. For physical applications we will have
to set z D i„
2 later on. Note that ? is indeed well-deﬁned since on elements in the
symmetric algebra, the operator Pƒ lowers the degree by one in each tensor factor.
In a next step we want to extend this product to more interesting functions than
the polynomial-like ones. The strategy is to look for a topology which makes the
product continuous and which allows for a large completion of S
C.V/. To start with,
one has to assume that V is endowed with a topology itself. Hence let V be a locally
convex Hausdorff space. In typical examples from quantum mechanics, V is the
(dual of the) phase space and hence ﬁnite dimensional, which makes the topology
unique. In quantum ﬁeld theory, V would be something like test function spaces, i.e.
either the Schwartz space S.Rd/ or C1
0 .M/ for a manifold M, etc. In this case V
would be a Fréchet or LF space.
We use now the continuous seminorms of V to extend them to tensor powers
V˝k for all k 2 N by taking their tensor powers: we equip V˝k with the -topology
inherited from V. This means that for a continuous seminorm p on V we consider p˝k
on V˝k and take all such seminorms to deﬁne a locally convex topology on V˝k.
Viewing the symmetric tensor powers as a subspace, this induces the -topology
also for S
C.V/, simply by restricting the seminorms p˝k. For the whole symmetric
algebra we need to extend the seminorms we have on each symmetric degree. This
can be done in many inequivalent ways. Useful for our purposes is the following
construction. We ﬁx a parameter R  1
2 and deﬁne
pR.a/ D
1
X
kD0
kŠRp˝k.ak/
(25)
for every a D P1
kD0 ak with ak 2 Sk
C.V/. Note that the sum is ﬁnite as long as
we take a in the symmetric algebra. Now taking all those seminorms pR for all
continuous seminorms p of V induces a locally convex topology on V. Clearly, this
is again Hausdorff. Moreover, all Sk
C.V/ are closed embedded subspaces in S
C.V/
with respect to this topology.
The remarkable property of this topology is now that a continuous ƒ will induce
a continuous star product [88]:
Theorem 4.1 Let ƒW V  V ! C be a continuous bilinear form on V. Then ? is a
continuous associative product on S
C.V/ with respect to the locally convex topology
induced by all the seminorms pR with p being a continuous seminorm on V, as long
as R  1
2.
The proof consists in an explicit estimate for a ? b. Note that the topology can
not be locally multiplicatively convex since in the Weyl algebra we have elements
satisfying canonical commutation relations, thereby forbidding a submultiplicative
seminorm.
Deﬁnition 4.2 (Locally convex Weyl algebra) Let ƒW V  V ! C be a contin-
uous bilinear form on V. Then the completion of S
C.V/ with respect to the above

434
S. Waldmann
locally convex topology and with the canonical extension of ? is called the locally
convex Weyl algebra WR.V; ?/.
Thus we have found a framework where the Weyl star product actually converges.
Without proofs we list a few properties of this Weyl algebra:
•
The locally convex Weyl algebra WR.V; ?/ is a locally convex unital associative
algebra. The product a ? b can be written as the absolutely convergent series
a ? b D 	 ı exp.zPƒ/.a ˝ b/:
(26)
•
The product ? depends holomorphically on z 2 C.
•
For
1
2
	 R < 1 the locally convex Weyl algebra WR.V; ?/ contains the
exponential functions e˛v for all v 2 V and all ˛ 2 C. They satisfy the usual Weyl
relations. Note that not only the unitary ones, i.e. for ˛ imaginary, are contained
in the Weyl algebra, but all exponentials.
•
The locally convex Weyl algebra is nuclear iff V is nuclear. In all relevant
examples in quantum theory this will be the case. In this case we refer to the
nuclear Weyl algebra.
•
If V admits an absolute Schauder basis, then the symmetrized tensor products of
the basis vectors constitute an absolute Schauder basis for the Weyl algebra, too.
Again, in many situations V has such a basis.
•
The Weyl algebras for different ƒ on V are isomorphic if the antisymmetric parts
of the bilinear forms coincide.
•
Evaluations at points in the topological dual V0 are continuous linear functionals
on WR.V; ?/. Hence we still can view the elements of the completion as
particular functions on V0.
•
The translations by elements in V0 still act on WR.V; ?/ by continuous auto-
morphisms. If R < 1 these translations are inner automorphism as soon as the
element ' 2 V0 is in the image of the musical map induced by ƒ.
We now conclude this section with a few comments on examples. First it is clear
that in ﬁnite dimensions we can take V D R2n with the canonical Poisson bracket
on the symmetric algebra. Then many types of orderings can be incorporated in
ﬁxing the symmetric part of ƒ, while the antisymmetric part is given by the Poisson
bracket. Thus all the resulting star products allow for this analytic framework. This
includes examples known earlier in the literature, see e.g. [6, 80]. In this case we get
a nuclear Weyl algebra with an absolute Schauder basis.
More interesting is of course the inﬁnite dimensional case. Here we have to
specify the space V and the bilinear form ƒ more carefully. In fact, the continuity of
ƒ becomes now a strong conditions since bilinear maps in locally convex analysis
tend to be only separately continuous without being continuous. However, there
are several situations where we can either conclude the continuity of a bilinear
separately continuous map by abstract arguments, like for Fréchet spaces. Or one
can show directly that the particular bilinear form one is interested in is continuous.
We give one of the most relevant examples for (quantum) ﬁeld theory:

Recent Developments in Deformation Quantization
435
Example Let M be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and let D be a normally
hyperbolic differential operator acting on a real vector bundle E with ﬁber metric h.
Moreover, we assume that D is a connection Laplacian for a metric connection with
respect to h plus some symmetric operator B of order zero. In all relevant examples
this is easy to obtain. Then one has advanced and retarded Green operators leading
to the propagator FM acting on test sections 1
0 .E/. We take V D 1
0 .E/ with
its usual LF topology. Then
ƒ.';  / D
Z
M
h1.FM.'/;  /	g
(27)
is the bilinear form leading to the Peierls bracket on the symmetric algebra S.V/.
Here 	g is the metric density as usual. The kernel theorem then guarantees that
ƒ is continuous as needed. Thus we obtain a locally convex and in fact nuclear
Weyl algebra from this. Now ƒ is highly degenerated. It follows that in the Poisson
algebra there are many Casimir elements. The kernel of FM generates a Poisson
ideal and also an ideal in the Weyl algebra, which coincides with the vanishing ideal
of the solution space. Hence dividing by this (Poisson) ideal gives a Poisson algebra
or Weyl algebra which can be interpreted as the observables of the (quantum) ﬁeld
theory determined by the wave equation Du D 0. It can then be shown that for every
Cauchy surface † in M there is a canonical algebra isomorphism to the Weyl algebra
build from the symplectic Poisson algebra on the initial conditions on †. Details of
this construction can be found in [88], see also [4] for the background information
on the wave equation.

Abstract The results of a study of the Dirac Hamiltonian for a point electron in
the zero-gravity Kerr–Newman spacetime are reported; here, “zero-gravity” means
G ! 0, where G is Newton’s constant of universal gravitation, and the limit
is effected in the Boyer–Lindquist coordinate chart of the maximal analytically
extended, topologically nontrivial, Kerr–Newman spacetime. In a nutshell, the
results are: the essential self-adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian; the reﬂection
symmetry about zero of its spectrum; the location of the essential spectrum,
exhibiting a gap about zero; and (under two smallness assumptions on some
parameters) the existence of a point spectrum in this gap, corresponding to bound
This is an expanded version of the talk titled “The Dirac equation and the Kerr-Newman space-
time,” given by the ﬁrst author at the Quantum Mathematical Physics conference.

states of Dirac’s point electron in the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the zero-G Kerr–
Newman ring singularity. The symmetry result of the spectrum extends to the
Dirac Hamiltonian for a point electron in a generalization of the zero-G Kerr–
Newman spacetime with different ratio of electric-monopole to magnetic-dipole
moment. The results are discussed in the context of the general-relativistic hydrogen
problem. Also, some interesting projects for further inquiry are listed in the last

Introduction
There are many studies of Dirac’s wave equation on curved background spacetimes,
see e.g. [4–7, 10, 12, 14–16, 20–23, 36, 37, 39, 42, 51–53]. The papers [2–4, 6, 7, 20–
23, 39, 45, 51, 52] in particular deal with Dirac’s equation on some member of the
Kerr–Newman family of spacetimes. However, to the best of our knowledge, nobody
has yet investigated Dirac’s equation on the entire maximal analytically extended,
topologically nontrivial Kerr–Newman spacetime. Such an investigation faces many
conceptual and technical obstacles, but it becomes feasible in a zero-gravity limit
which preserves the nontrivial topology of the Kerr–Newman spacetime and its
associated electromagnetic structures. In this limit one can rigorously study these
general-relativistic effects on the Dirac Hamiltonian, separated from—and not
obscured by—those caused by general-relativistic gravity. The results of such a
zero-gravity investigation [32, 47] are reported here.
Readers whose expertise includes hyperbolic partial differential equations on
nontrivial background spacetimes, and who right away want to ﬁnd out about the
results that we have obtained, may now want to jump to the technical Sect.3.
Readers with expertise elsewhere in mathematical physics may ﬁnd the few
introductory lines written above hardly motivating enough to read on, however.
Fortunately, a study of Dirac’s equation on a zero-gravity Kerr–Newman spacetime
can be motivated in at least two different other ways, one of which we are going
to elaborate on in the next section. There we discuss the perplexing problem
of the general-relativistic hydrogen spectrum, which ought to be interesting to
most mathematical quantum physicists.1 Yet another way to motivate our study—
which is even more intriguing, but was not yet ready for public announcement
1We are not suggesting that experimental physicists should not worry about this academic problem.
For the empirically relevant problem to estimate the inﬂuence of, say, Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld on
the spectrum of hydrogen in the lab, see Papapetrou [40].

tioned here (in the last section)—has meanwhile been made public in our paper
[31].
Our results are stated informally in the context of the general-relativistic
hydrogen problem at the end of the next section, while the precise statements and
some technical details are given in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we list open questions left
unanswered by our study, and we indicate the key idea of [31].

On the General-Relativistic Hydrogen Spectrum
Hydrogen has played a crucial role in the development of the quantum theory of
atomic spectra, and presumably this simplest of the chemical atoms will continue
to play an important role in the ongoing efforts to ﬁnd a more satisfactory
theory; for instance, one that does not rely on artiﬁcial UV cutoffs, etc. Yet
we do not have to venture into the realm of quantum ﬁeld theory or quantum
gravity to encounter perplexing issues that await clariﬁcation. We simply ask for
a general-relativistic counterpart of the special-relativistic spectrum of the quantum
mechanical Dirac Hamiltonian for an electron (modeled as a point charge) in the
electromagnetic ﬁeld of a proton (modeled either as a point—or spherical—charge,
or as a combination of electric charge plus current distribution to account also
for the proton’s magnetic dipole ﬁeld). Since gravity is very weak one would
expect the general-relativistic Dirac point spectrum to differ from Sommerfeld’s ﬁne
structure formula only by the tiniest amounts, and in particular to be computable
perturbatively using Newton’s constant of universal gravitation, G, as expansion
parameter. But if that is indeed what one expects, then one will be in for a
surprise!
2.1
The Coulomb Approximation
In this subsection only the electric ﬁeld of the proton is considered. To have a
reference point, we begin by recalling the spectral results of the familiar textbook
problem, which is Dirac’s equation for a point electron in ﬂat Minkowski spacetime
equipped with a proton, modeled as a point charge having a straight worldline; in
the rest frame of this model proton the electron experiences only the electrostatic
Coulomb ﬁeld of the point charge. Subsequently we turn to the general-relativistic
version of this problem.

The Dirac Electron in Reissner–Nordström Spacetime
We next switch on G and ask for the general-relativistic spectrum of a “test”
electron in the Reissner–Nordström “electromagnetic spacetime of a point proton.”
This spacetime is a spherically symmetric, eventually (in an open neighborhood of
spacelike inﬁnity) static, charged solution of the Einstein–Maxwell equations (see
2We follow the notation of Lieb and Loss [34]; thus C1
c .R3nf0g/ denotes functions which are
compactly supported away from the origin in R3.

here, .t; r; ; '/ are Schwarzschild-type coordinates which asymptotically near
spacelike inﬁnity become just the spherical coordinates of Minkowski spacetime
(obtained by setting f.r/  1 in the above metric). For the empirical values of mp
and e, one has Gm2
p=e2 
 1, so this spacetime is then static everywhere and covered
by a single chart of .t; r; ; '/ coordinates, exhibiting a timelike naked singularity5
at r D 0.
In the naked singularity sector Gm2
p < e2 (recall that the empirical proton’s
(mass, charge) pair belongs in this sector) one is confronted with the perhaps
unexpected result that the Dirac Hamiltonian is not essentially self-adjoint—any
general relativist who abhors naked singularities will presumably feel vindicated by
this result. Yet, as shown in [5, 8, 16], there exists a one-parameter family of self-
adjoint extensions of the Dirac operator with domain C1
c .R3nf0g/4 which commute
with the angular momentum operator, and all of these have an absolutely continuous
spectrum given by
ac D .1; mc2 [ Œmc2; 1/I
(6)
furthermore, Cohen and Powers [16] show that any pure point spectrum can only be
located inside the gap of the continuum. Unfortunately, Cohen and Powers merely
state that their preliminary studies indicate the existence of eigenvalues, and we are
not aware of any work that has actually shown the existence of eigenvalues for any
of the self-adjoint extensions of the formal Dirac operator on the naked Reissner–
Nordström spacetime.6
5This well-known naked singularity is usually not considered to be a counterexample of the (weak)
cosmic censorship hypothesis, based on the following reasoning: paraphrasing Freeman Dyson,
general relativity is a classical physical theory which applies only to physics in the large (e.g.
astrophysical and cosmic scales), not to atomic physics; and so, since cosmic bodies of mass M
and charge Q must have a ratio GM2=Q2  1, the Reissner–Nordström spacetime of such a body
(assumed spherical), when collapsed, exhibits a black hole, not a naked singularity. While we agree
that cosmic bodies (in mechanical virial-equilibrium) must have a ratio GM2=Q2  1, we don’t
see why the successful applications of general relativity theory at astrophysical and cosmic scales
would imply that general relativity cannot be successfully applied at atomic, or even sub-atomic
scales, where typically GM2=e2  1.
6Interestingly enough, though, Belgiorno–Martellini–Baldicchi [8] proved the existence of bound
states of a Dirac point electron equipped with an anomalous magnetic moment in the Reissner–
Nordström spacetime with naked singularity, provided the anomalous magnetic moment is large
enough; in that case, the Dirac Hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint.

Remark 2.1 One may also want to replace mp by other positive values, in particular
by mD  2mp (to study the deuterium spectrum) and by mT  3mp (to study the
tritium spectrum). These choices leave one in the naked-singularity sector of the
Reissner–Nordström spacetimes.
ut
While the general-relativistic hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium problems for-
mulated with the Reissner–Nordström spacetime for an electrostatic point proton
inevitably lead to the naked singularity sector, mathematical physicists have also
studied a whole family of “hydrogenic problems” with other possible positive mass
values M in place of mp. When GM2  e2, the analytical extension of the outer
Reissner–Nordström spacetime will feature the event horizon of a black hole behind
which lurks the timelike singularity. Moreover, when GM2 > e2 then there exists
yet another, inner horizon between the timelike singularity and the event horizon,
and the region between this and the event horizon is not static. Furthermore, the
maximal analytical extension features multiple copies of these spacetime patches,
which to some extent are causally separated by Cauchy horizons.
For the black hole sector GM2 > e2 of parameter space Cohen and Powers
[16] showed that the Dirac Hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint on the set of C1
bispinor-valued functions which are compactly supported outside the event horizon,
but its spectrum is the whole real line, and the pure point spectrum is empty. The
problem was picked up again by Belgiorno [5] and by Finster et al. [19], who also
proved the absence of bound states supported outside the outer event horizon in
the Reissner–Nordström black hole spacetime. The latter authors considered also
bispinor wave functions which are supported on both sides of the event horizon; in
particular, they also showed that in the extreme case GM2 D e2 any bound state
must be supported entirely behind the event horizon. An interesting open question
is whether in the subextreme black hole sector GM2 > e2 any bound state of a
self-adjoint Dirac operator must be supported entirely inside the event horizon.
Now, according to the mainstream view of relativists, only the black hole sector
of a spacetime family is physically relevant, and for physicists taking the (for a long
time also mainstream) positivistic view only the part outside of the black hole’s
event horizon is of concern to physics—this combination of viewpoints thus forces
one to conclude that in such a physical Reissner–Nordström spacetime there are no
bound states of a Dirac point electron without anomalous magnetic moment.
But positivism is just a form of philosophy, not universally shared by all
physicists. And so, if with Werner Israel one believes—as we do—that general
relativity makes statements about the physics inside the event horizon of a black
hole, and explores mathematically what it says the physics is, then bound states of a
Dirac point electron without anomalous magnetic moment may conceivably exist in
a physical Reissner–Nordström black hole spacetime, namely supported inside the
event horizon. In the same vein we may as well ignore the censorship hypothesis for
the naked-singularity spacetimes and worry about whether bound states of a Dirac
point electron without anomalous magnetic moment exist in a Reissner–Nordström

spacetime with naked singularity. In either case their existence would yet have to be
proved.
But one thing seems clear: none of these putative point spectra can be obtained
perturbatively from Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure spectrum by “switching on G.”
In particular, the black hole point spectrum would presumably vanish as G ! 0
because the black hole itself vanishes in this limit, and so bear no resemblance to
Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure spectrum as G ! 0. And whether any part of any
of the hypothetical point spectra for the naked singularity sector will resemble
Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure spectrum as G ! 0 is anybody’s best guess. Hopefully
someone will work it out eventually!
Remark 2.2 The putative failure of G-perturbative reasoning can be traced to the
non-integrable electromagnetic stresses and energy density which are the source
terms for the Ricci curvature tensor of the Reissner–Nordström spacetime. This
is the old problem of inﬁnite electrostatic self-energy of a point charge, which
because of the equivalence of energy and mass becomes its inﬁnite self-mass
problem. In a special-relativistic setting it assigns an inﬁnite inertia to a point
charge, which hounds one when trying to formulate a dynamical theory of charged
point particle motion beyond the test particle approximation, but in a general-
relativistic setting the gravitational coupling leads, in addition, to very strong
curvature singularities of the spacetime generated by the non-integrable self-energy
densities. Interestingly enough, for the remarkably accurate computation of the
special-relativistic quantum-mechanical point spectrum of hydrogen (in the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation) only the electrostatic interaction energy of a point
proton and a point electron enters the Dirac equation through the usual “minimal
coupling,” i.e. both self-energy terms are ignored. These self-energy terms are
also ignored in the electromagnetic minimal coupling term of Dirac’s equation
on a Reissner–Nordström spacetime. But the electric self-energy density of the
point proton enters the general-relativistic Dirac equation of a point electron
in the Reissner–Nordström spacetime also through the covariant derivatives of
the spacetime, for this non-integrable density is a curvature source term in the
Einstein–Maxwell equations. So one may contemplate purging it, too. This leads
to the vacuum Einstein equations, and so instead of the Reissner–Nordström
spacetime one would obtain the Schwarzschild spacetime; see [27] for a recent
pedagogical treatment. Yet to retain the electrostatic interaction between point
electron and proton in the Dirac Hamiltonian, consistent with this approximation,
one would next have to solve the Maxwell equations with a point proton as source
in a Schwarzschild background spacetime, with the point proton located in its
“center”—if this makes any sense at all—and then treat the Dirac point electron as a
test charge experiencing the uncharged background metric as well as the electric
ﬁeld of the point proton imposed on that background metric. We are not aware
of any such study; furthermore, we are not sure whether a mathematically well-
posed formulation of the indicated classical electrical problem is feasible because

448
M.K.-H. Kiessling and A.S. Tahvildar-Zadeh
the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is not static inside its event horizon, and its
singularity is spacelike, so that its “center” is a spacelike line, not a point, raising
the question where exactly to place the point proton! Yet it may be mathematically
interesting to sort this out.
ut
We close this subsection by emphasizing that the just contemplated removal
of the self-energy density of the point proton from the spacetime equations is a
rather contrived step and not easily justiﬁable—if at all—, in contrast to the readily
vindicated omission of the inﬁnite self-interaction terms from the electromagnetic
energy in the Hamiltonian. It has the ﬂavor of “a last desperate attempt” to cling
to the point proton approximation when setting up the general-relativistic hydrogen
problem for a Dirac “test electron” interacting with it. Since a physical proton is
a compound particle with a ﬁnite size, the mathematical catastrophes associated
with the point proton approximation may well be dismissed as the result of an
oversimpliﬁcation and declared not a cause for real concern. Indeed, since it is
known that ﬁnite-size proton models remove the special-relativistic catastrophe
of the hydrogenic problem at Z D 1=˛S  137:036 [26], it is not difﬁcult to
convince oneself that a ﬁnite-size model of a spherical proton avoids the general-
relativistic spacetime singularity of the Reissner–Nordström spacetime of a point
proton. Although this introduces the problem of having to make assumptions about
the structure of the proton, the tiny size of the proton suggests that all possible
spherical ﬁnite size models should yield the same leading order corrections (in
terms of powers of G) to the special-relativistic spectrum. For example, assuming
a model that produces a spherical surface charge, and zero binding energy, one
would obtain a spacetime which coincides with the Reissner–Nordström spacetime
for r > rp, and which is ﬂat for r < rp. Here, rp is the solution to mpc2 
e2=r D 0, viz. rp D e2=.mpc2/, which is 1836 times smaller than the so-called
“classical electron radius” e2=.mc2/, where m is the electron’s empirical mass. The
spacetime is not smooth at rp but its singularity corresponds to just a jump in its
Ricci curvatures. So a G-perturbative calculation of the Dirac spectrum should be
feasible.
2.2
The Hyperﬁne Structure
So far we have assumed that the proton has only an electric charge. However,
the physical proton appears to also possess a magnetic dipole moment. The
interaction of the electron spin-magnetic moment with this magnetic moment of the
proton accounts for a hyperﬁne structure of the hydrogen spectrum, as computed
with quantum-mechanical perturbation theory. Unfortunately, assuming a point
proton carrying an electric charge and magnetic dipole is QM-non-perturbatively
catastrophic even in a non-relativistic setting. A QM-non-perturbative calculation
requires a model of a ﬁnite-size proton. Pekeris [41] proposed that as a substitute
for such a ﬁnite-size model of the proton with charge and currents one may want to

Dirac’s Point Electron in the Zero-Gravity Kerr–Newman World
449
take the well-known electromagnetic Kerr–Newman spacetime family with its ring
singularity and electromagnetic ﬁelds which, near spacelike inﬁnity, approach an
electric monopole and a magnetic dipole structure. Of course, this proposal should
not be taken too seriously, in the sense that the inner structure of the proton is hardly
reproduced correctly by the Kerr–Newman solution. Yet it is certainly interesting to
investigate Dirac’s equation for a point electron in the Kerr–Newman spacetime with
its parameters matched to those of the proton.
The Dirac Electron in the Kerr–Newman Spacetime with G > 0
In the spirit of the previous subsection we now inquire into the general-relativistic
spectrum of a “test” electron in the electromagnetic Kerr–Newman spacetime [38],
pretending that its electromagnetic ﬁelds represent those of an extended proton with
charge and magnetic moment. We do not display its metric (the line element of
which is much more complicated than (4); a special case will be exhibited further
below, though) but only mention that it has three parameters—charge Q (here chosen
to equal e), ADM mass M (here chosen to equal mp), and ADM angular momentum
per unit mass a, here to be chosen such that ea equals the magnetic moment of
the proton. This puts us into the naked singularity sector, but as before, we give a
mini-survey of both, naked singularity sector and black hole sector, cf. [11].
•
The open black hole sector, GM2 > Q2 C a2c4=G, was studied in [7, 20, 21, 51],
and no bound states of the Dirac equation were found for its domain supported
either outside the event horizon or on both sides of it7; the latter situation was
studied only in [20, 21], involving also a matching across the Cauchy horizon
lurking inside the event horizon.
•
Interestingly, in the extreme case GM2 D Q2 C a2c4=G (the boundary of the
open Kerr-Newman black hole sector, which belongs to the black hole sector,
too), bound states supported outside the event horizon exist for a sequence of
special m values [51].
•
In the naked singularity sector, GM2 <
Q2 C a2c4=G, the whole spacetime
manifold is causally vicious, and we are not aware of any study of the Dirac
equation on it.
Since in this subsection we inquire into whether a G-deformation of the Sommerfeld
spectrum with hyperﬁne corrections can be computed by studying Dirac’s equation
on the Kerr–Newman spacetime, the outcome is somewhat disappointing: the proton
parameters M D mp and Q D e belong to the naked singularity sector of the Kerr–
Newman family, and nothing seems to be known about the Dirac equation on it.
On the other hand, since the proton mass does not enter the Sommerfeld
ﬁne structure formula, one may still ask about the G-dependence of the discrete
Dirac spectra in the extreme Kerr–Newman black hole spacetime and whether
7The addition of a positive cosmological constant [6] has not lead to bound states either.

450
M.K.-H. Kiessling and A.S. Tahvildar-Zadeh
they resemble the Sommerfeld spectrum with hyperﬁne corrections as G ! 0;
unfortunately, so far not much is known about these point spectra, either, but
someone should work out the answer eventually!
The Dirac Electron in the Zero-G Kerr–Newman Spacetime-
The inquiry started in the previous subsection suggests a closely related spectral
question about the Dirac operator and the Kerr–Newman spacetime, one which
avoids all the causal pathologies associated with the latter. Namely, since the canon-
ical (in the sense of Geroch [25]) zero-G limit of the maximal analytically extended
Kerr–Newman spacetime (zGKN) does not yield the Minkowski spacetime but a ﬂat
yet topologically nontrivial spacetime with a ring singularity [47], it is an interesting
question whether the Dirac spectrum for an electron in this spacetime bears any
resemblance to the Sommerfeld spectrum with hyperﬁne corrections.
The apparently ﬁrst investigation in this direction is by Pekeris [41]. However,
following Israel [28], he works with the zero-G limit of a single sheet of the Kerr–
Newman electromagnetic spacetime, which is a Minkowski spacetime decorated
with truncated multi-valued harmonic ﬁelds. Figure 1, produced by J. Gair and
published in [24], and in [35] by D. Lynden-Bell, and which is reproduced here
with permission from both D. Lynden-Bell and J. Gair, shows a drawing of electric
(top) and magnetic (bottom) lines of force in a planar section, containing the axis of
symmetry, of a spacelike snapshot. The ring singularity pierces the drawing at the
two singular points where all the ﬁeld lines seem to emerge from, respectively end
at.
If one chooses to interpret the zero-G limit of the spacetime in this single-
sheeted way, then one is forced to interpret the inevitable jump discontinuities in the
electromagnetic ﬁelds as being caused by ultra-singular two-dimensional sources. A
geometrically distinguished choice of such a source is the ultra-singular disc source
spanned by the ring singularity, studied by [24, 28, 35, 41], and [29]. These disc-
type charge and current densities are not integrable, but are magically compensated
in parts by oppositely inﬁnite charges and currents on the ring, in such a manner that
the ﬁnite charge of the Kerr–Newman ﬁelds is produced.
By contrast, from the perspective of a two-sheeted interpretation of the zGKN
spacetime and its electromagnetic ﬁelds the jump discontinuities across the line
spanned by the two singular points seen in Fig. 1 are artifacts of the single-sheeted
drawing of the multi-valued harmonic functions with branch cut placed arbitrarily
at the disc spanned by the singular ring. Namely, the sources of the ﬁelds living on
the double-sheeted maximal analytically extended zero-G Kerr–Newman spacetime
are ﬁnite sesqui-poles concentrated in the singular ring, see [47]. Thus the Dirac
equation on this maximal analytically extended zero-G Kerr–Newman spacetime
can be studied in an orderly manner. We have begun such an investigation [31, 32]
of Dirac’s equation on the maximal analytically extended zero-G Kerr–Newman
spacetime, and in the following we report on it.

If the limit a ! 0 of the discrete spectrum converges to the spectrum of the Dirac

and a negative Sommerfeld ﬁne structure spectrum.
Remark 2.3 Our sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of the discrete spectrum
presumably are not necessary conditions. In any event, for our inquiry into general-
relativistic effects on the hydrogen spectrum we use the empirical magnetic moment
of the proton and ﬁnd 2a  103„=.mc/ (in rough agreement with the empirical size
of the proton; cf. [41]), so the ﬁrst sufﬁcient smallness condition is fulﬁlled (note

condition becomes ˛S  1=137:036, so the second condition is fulﬁlled then, too. ut

In this section we present the essentials of our study. We begin by describing the
zero-G Kerr–Newman spacetime and its electromagnetic ﬁeld in more detail. Then
we formulate Dirac’s equation on it in its “standard” format, using Cartan’s frame
method, which allows us to deﬁne the Dirac Hamiltonian on a static, spacelike slice
of the zGKN spacetime. Finally, we state precisely our results, together with a few
remarks regarding our proofs.

becomes (7), solving Einstein’s vacuum equations R	 D 0 — usually obtained
by setting T	  0 — while their electromagnetic ﬁeld F D dA, with A given
by (8) solves the zero-G Maxwell equations (which in our compact notation look
unchanged) on the limiting zero-G spacetime.
The zGKN spacetime is readily illustrated as follows. Since it is static, it sufﬁces
to discuss a constant-t snapshot, N, whose metric is given by the space part
of (7), with .r; ; '/ oblate spheroidal coordinates. Since N is axisymmetric, it
furthermore sufﬁces to discuss a constant-' section of N. Shown in Fig. 2 are the

the coordinate grid on the sheets shows the constant- lines (hyperbolas) and
constant-r lines (ellipses). Solutions to Einstein’s equations having this two-sheeted
topology were ﬁrst discovered by Zipoy [54], for which reason we speak of Zipoy
topology.

They were discovered in this form by Appell [1] who realized that these are
multi-valued harmonic ﬁelds on Euclidean space. The insight that multi-valued
harmonic ﬁelds become single-valued on so-called branched Riemann spaces is
due to Sommerfeld [43], whose pioneering work was generalized and completed
by Evans [17] and his students. In particular, the ﬁelds E and B given in (12) are
single-valued harmonic ﬁelds on N. Moreover, due to the axisymmetry, the lines
of force of E and B are planar curves in doubled half-planes with Zipoy topology
which contain the axis of symmetry.
As an illustration of the single-valuedness, and smoothness (except for their
divergence at the ring singularity) of the electromagnetic ﬁelds on the max-
imal analytically extended zGKN spacetime, in Fig. 3 we show the graph of
the electric potential modulated onto the constant-.t; '/ section of spacetime
depicted in Fig. 2. The electric potential is positive on the upper and nega-
tive on the lower sheet, diverging at the ring singularity (omitted in this pic-
ture, yet discernible due to the spikes in the potential), and smoothly “criss-
crossing” at the disc spanned by the singular ring (a line in this constant-.t; '/
section). The electric lines of force (not shown in Fig. 3) are orthogonal to the
equipotentials.

Following the strategy of Glazman, in [32] we prove:
Theorem 3.1 Let any self-adjoint extension of the formal Dirac operator OH on H
be denoted by the same letter. Suppose E 2 spec OH. Then E 2 spec OH.
Remark 3.2 We can also replace Qa with Ia2=c in (8), introducing a KN-

singularity, independently of Q. This changes QA0 and QA2 to

The unique self-adjoint extension of OH will also be denoted by OH.

Theorem 3.4 For Q D e D Ia=c, the continuous spectrum of OH on H is R n

This is what one would intuitively expect from a negatively charged electron in the
r > 0 sheet that is attracted to a small-a ring singularity which appears positively
charged in the r > 0 sheet: the likelihood of ﬁnding the electron on the negatively
charged side of the ring singularity should be exponentially small. Interestingly, by
anti-symmetry, the negative energy “ground” state (in the sense of having smallest
absolute energy) is obtained by reﬂection of the positive energy ground state proﬁle
at r D 0. By the same kind of “intuitive explanation” given of the behavior of
the electron in the positive energy ground state, the negative energy ground state
corresponds to the behavior expected rather from a positron.

Summary and Outlook
4.1
Summary
Motivated by the mathematical-physics problem of general-relativistic extensions of
the Sommerfeld ﬁne-structure spectrum of hydrogen, in particular those including
the hyper-ﬁne structure, in this presentation we have addressed the Dirac equation
of a point electron in the zero-G limit of the maximal analytically extended, double-
sheeted Kerr–Newman spacetime. A related study has been proposed by Pekeris
[41] who, however, studied Dirac’s equation on a one-sheeted truncation of the
zGKN spacetime, which comes at the price of nonintegrable “proton” charge and
current “densities” concentrated in a disc8 and raises the question of boundary
conditions for the Dirac bispinors at the disc; cf. also [24]. By contrast, we have
found that our zGKN Dirac Hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint, and its unique
self-adjoint extension has a spectrum which is symmetric about zero, containing the
familiar continuum .1; mc2/ [ .mc2; 1/ plus, under a smallness condition, a
discrete spectrum in the gap of the continuum; for the hydrogen parameter values the
smallness condition is satisﬁed. Moreover, our results imply that the point spectrum
converges to two anti-symmetric copies of the Sommerfeld spectrum when the ring
radius of the zGKN spacetime vanishes, if it converges to the spectrum of the zero-a
operator.
We end this summary with a disclaimer: we are not advocating that the ring
singularity of the double-sheeted zGKN spacetime were an accurate model for a
physical proton. Rather, our zGKN Born–Oppenheimer hydrogen atom model is
merely an interesting toy model which reduces to the familiar special-relativistic
Born–Oppenheimer hydrogen atom model (and an anti-symmetric copy thereof)
when a D 0, and thus allows one to rigorously study non-perturbatively some
general-relativistic a > 0 effects on the quantum-mechanical hydrogen spectrum,
such as the hyperﬁne structure (which cannot be studied non-perturbatively with the
point proton model, featuring an electric charge and a magnetic dipole moment).

Outlook
Our study leaves many questions unanswered, but also suggests some intriguing
speculations (the latter were not included in the talk at Regensburg).
Open Questions
First of all, we would like to know the point spectrum of the “double-sheeted zGKN”
Dirac Hamiltonian in more detail, and as function of the ring radius a; a numerical
study is currently in progress.
More in line with PDE research into Dirac’s equation on general relativistic
spacetimes, we would like to know what happens when a Dirac bispinor wave
function impinges on the zGKN ring singularity; in particular, how much of it
scatters and how much will dive through the ring?
Furthermore, we would like to know what happens if the zGKN magnetic
moment Qa is replaced by Ia2=c, so that the electromagnetic zGKN spacetime
becomes a zGK spacetime decorated with an Appell–Sommerfeld ﬁeld of arbitrary
charge Q and current I. Is the Dirac Hamiltonian still essentially self-adjoint? If not,
are there distinguished self-adjoint extensions? Can one characterize the spectrum
of the self-adjoint extension(s)? Note that, if Q ¤ Ia=c then the Chandrasekhar–
Page–Toop ansatz to separate variables fails, and one is faced with a two-variable
PDE eigenvalue problem.
Incidentally, independent of any inquiry into the Dirac equation, the following
question is relevant to the problem of uniqueness of the Kerr–Newman manifold: is
it possible to G-deform the zGK spacetime decorated with an Appell–Sommerfeld
ﬁeld of charge Q and current I into a solution of the Einstein–Maxwell equations
only for the KN choice Qa D Ia2=c?
Thus we also would like to investigate what happens when gravity is “switched
back on.” After reviewing the enormous obstacles which are encountered in the
pertinent literature on the subject, we concluded that these are caused mainly by
the non-integrable electromagnetic self-energy densities of point electron and point
or ring proton as computed with the linear Maxwell–Lorentz equations which
lead to unphysical spacetime curvatures once gravity is switched on. To avoid
these problems we plan to study the nonlinear Einstein–Maxwell–Born–Infeld
system, which promises to yield the mildest conceivable spacetime singularities
[46]. Unfortunately, their nonlinearity is formidable, and progress will most likely
come slowly. Moreover, it is clear that one has to abandon the Born–Oppenheimer
approximation, but the full two-body problem (cf. [9]) may still be out of
reach.

Dirac’s Point Electron in the Zero-Gravity Kerr–Newman World

Speculations
As for the intriguing speculations, our research also led to a completely different
line of inquiry which we have embarked on in [31]. Namely, as has been advocated
by Stückelberg [44], Feynman [18], Thaller [48, 49], and others, the puzzling
spectral properties of Dirac’s equation interpreted quantum mechanically, as again
highlighted by the mysterious anti-symmetry of the Dirac spectrum of a “point
electron” in the anti-symmetric double-sheeted zGKN spacetime, suggest that
Dirac’s equation captures the dynamics and bound states of both electron and
positron. Yet interpreted as a quantum-mechanical equation, Dirac’s equation is
a single particle equation. This has suggested to us to entertain the hypothesis
that particles and anti-particles are merely “different sides of the same medal,” i.e.
forming a single meta-particle with a binary structure, rather than being different
particles in their own right. The very anti-symmetric structure of the zGKN ring
singularity supplies just such a binary structure, which in [31] we have tentatively
identiﬁed with an electron/anti-electron meta-particle. There we show that the
Dirac spectrum of such a zGKN-ring particle in the electrostatic ﬁeld of a given
point charge (now playing the role of the point proton) with straight world line in
the pertinent zGKN spacetime is determined by the same equation that we have
discussed in this presentation. It’s the narrative that changes, not the mathematics.
This narrative, where electron and anti-electron are just two different “sides of the
same medal,” is faithfully realized by the electromagnetic ring singularity of the
zGKN spacetime, and we ponder seriously the possibility of it having a true physical
signiﬁcance.

Abstract Noncommutative geometry allows to unify the basic building blocks
of particle physics, Yang-Mills-Higgs theory and general relativity, into a single
geometrical framework. The resulting effective theory constrains the couplings
of the standard model and reduces the number of degrees of freedom. After
an introduction of the basic ideas of Noncommutative geometry, I will present
its predictions for the standard model and the few known models beyond the
standard model based on a classiﬁcation scheme for ﬁnite spectral triples. Most
of these models, including the Standard Model, are now ruled out by LHC data.

Introduction
Noncommutative geometry as an algebraic approach to geometry has surprisingly
proved to be a useful tool to understand the geometry of the standard model of
particle physics. Connes’ spectral triples allow to transfer geometrical notions from
compact Riemannian spin manifolds to ﬁnite matrix spaces. The central object in
this construction is a generalised Dirac operator which in such ﬁnite cases can be
interpreted as a fermionic mass matrix of the particle model.
It came as a surprise that spectral triples, which were originally constructed to
investigate for example singular foliations of manifolds, allow to incorporate the
intricate structure of the standard model particle multiplets as well as its complicated
representation theoretic structure. Product spaces built from spectral triples over
manifolds and from ﬁnite spectral triples over matrix algebras proved to be very
useful to construct models known from particle physics, in particular the standard
model.
The Dirac operator is a central ingredient of a spectral triple and plays a multiple
role. On the one hand it substitutes for the metric of the underlying space(-time),
on the other hand it deﬁnes the dynamics of the fermions. If one constructs spectral
triples for the standard model, the Higgs ﬁeld becomes a natural part of the Dirac
operator acting as an inter-twiner of representations. In the noncommutative context
such scalar ﬁelds as the Higgs ﬁeld are then interpreted as connections of the internal
matrix space and are therefore considered as part of the metric.
In recent years the matrix geometries that underly the standard model have been
classiﬁed in various ways. As another surprise it was found that the standard model
not only ﬁts into the noncommutative framework but is also in many ways a very
minimal model and the chiral structure of the electro-weak sector appears to be quite
natural in the setting of ﬁnite spectral triples.
But the classiﬁcation schemes also allow to construct particle models beyond
the standard model. These models generally have a rich phenomenology and may
contribute interesting new insights to the dark matter problem which is probably one
of the most important open question in today’s particle physics.
These conference proceedings were written as a supplement to a talk given at
conference Quantum Mathematical Physics, A Bridge between Mathematics and

Noncommutative Geometry and the Physics of the LHC Era
473
Physics which took place in 2014 in Regensburg. The interested reader may proﬁt
from the talk and is referred to the web page [1].
The article is organised as follows. Section 2 aims to give an introduction into the
notion of a spectral triple, its axioms, almost-commutative spectral triples which are
central to the noncommutative approach to particle physics and some classiﬁcation
schemes for spectral triples. Furthermore it gives a short account of how gauge
groups appear in the framework and how the relevant Dirac operators appear. In
the third section we describe the spectral action which is a natural action functional
on spectral triples. We also give an overview on alternative action functionals for
Dirac operators. Some of those may naturally be applied in the Lorentzian setting.
The fourth section deals with the predictions noncommutative geometry makes for
the standard model and its short-comings in the light of recent experimental data,
in particular the detection of a Higgs-like boson by the LHC experiments. The ﬁfth
section gives examples of models beyond the standard model with a particular focus
on an extension which displays new fermions, gauge bosons and a new scalar ﬁeld.
This model seems to agree with experimental data and may provide interesting
dark matter candidates. We end this article with some questions to noncommutative
geometry and particle physics.

Spectral Triples
We try to give a short introduction into the basic concepts of noncommutative
geometry as needed for particle physics. For more in-depth introductions we
recommend the classical book of Connes [2] and the more recent general overview
of Connes and Marcolli [3].
For a pedagogical introduction to spectral triples we recommend Khalkhali’s
textbook [4] and for details on the particle physics side of the subject the excellent
book by van Suijlekom [5] and the lecture notes of Schücker [6].
2.1
General Deﬁnitions
Let us give a brief account on the basic ingredients of noncommutative geometry
in the formulation given by Connes [2, 7]. The basic geometric building blocks are
spectral triples .A; D; H/ which, in the even, real case, are given by the following
ﬁve components:
•
a unital pre-C algebra A.
•
a separable Hilbert space H on which the algebra is faithfully represented with
the representation  W A ! End.H/.
•
an unbounded self-adjoint operator D W dom.D/ ! H with compact resolvent.
This operator will be referred to as the Dirac operator.

474
C.A. Stephan
•
an anti-unitary operator J W H ! H. In the mathematical literature J is referred
to as the real structure while in physics literature it is usually called the charge
conjugation operator.
•
a unitary operator  W H ! H, the abstract volume element or chirality operator.
Example The standard example of a spectral triple is build on a compact
n-dimensional Riemannian spin-manifold .M; g/. In this case the algebra
A D C1.M/ and the Hilbert space consists of the square-integrable spinors
H D L2..†//. The representation of the algebra on the Spinors is simply by point-
wise multiplication. The Dirac operator is the standard Dirac operator associated to
the Levi-Civita connection r and is locally given by .=@ /.x/ WD P
i ei  rei .x/,
where ei, i D 1; ::; n form an orthonormal basis of the tangent space Tx.M/ and
X denotes the Clifford multiplication of a vector. The charge conjugation and the
volume element are the standard operators from particle physics.
The ﬁve components of the spectral triple are required to fulﬁl the following set of
axioms in order to constitute a spectral triple:
Axiom 1 This axiom assumes that there exists a classical (spectral) dimension n
associated to the growth of the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. It is also referred
to as the axiom of ﬁnite summability. Since the resolvent of D is compact its
eigenvalues form a decreasing sequence f˛ig. The axiom then states that there is
a smallest n 2 N such that the ith eigenvalue is asymptotically for i ! 1 of the
order of O.i1=n/. This smallest n is deﬁned as the dimension of the spectral triple.
Remark 2.1 The dimension of a spectral triple can be zero. Indeed this happens
for ﬁnite spectral triples build from matrix algebras which play a central rôle in
noncommutative approach to particle physics.
Remark 2.2 The dimension of the spectral triple of an n-dimensional Riemannian
spin manifold coincides by Weyl’s law for the growth of eigenvalues of =@ with the
dimension of the manifold.
Axiom 2 This axiom requires that the commutator of the Hilbert space representa-
tion of each element in the algebra with the Dirac operator is a bounded operator on
H. So we have for all a 2 A that ŒD; .a/ 2 B.H/.
From now on we will drop the explicit mentioning of the representation  when no
confusion arises.
Remark 2.3 This axiom certainly holds for the spectral triple of a manifold since
the commutator of the Dirac operator with a differentiable function equals Clifford
multiplication with its differential, i.e. Œ=@; f D df ] , f 2 C1.M/ and  2 .†/:
Axiom 3 The Dirac operator is a ﬁrst-order operator. In the algebraic setting of
spectral triples the axiom states that for all a; b 2 A we have ŒŒD; a; JbJ1 D 0.
Remark 2.4 This axiom can again be checked easily for the spectral triple of a
manifold since Œ=@; f is a zero-order differential operator for all f 2 C1.M/ and
therefore commutes with any function in the algebra.

Noncommutative Geometry and the Physics of the LHC Era
475
Axiom 4 The axiom of strong regularity states that the elements of the algebra
are differentiable in a suitable way. For any bounded operator T 2 B.H/ we
deﬁne deﬁne ı.T/ WD ŒjDj; T where dom ı D fT
2 B.H/jT.domjDj/ 
.domjDj/ andı.T/ 2 B.H/g. Furthermore we deﬁne H1 WD T1
jD1 dom Dj.
The axiom demands that A, ŒD; A and EndA.H1/ are in
B1.H/ WD
1
\
jD1
dom ◦j:
Axiom 5 The orientability axiom gives further conditions on the chirality operator.
It demands that 2 D idH and if the dimension n of the spectral triple is even that
D D D. In the odd-dimensional case  D idH. Furthermore we require that
 can be represented by a Hochschild n-cycle. For further details of this axiom we
refer to [7].
Remark 2.5 For the spectral triple of a manifold the abstract volume form 
coincides with the Clifford multiplication of the metric volume form dvolg.
Axiom 6 The reality axiom demands a set of commutation relations for the real
structure J with the other operators. In particular we have J2 D , JD D 0DJ and
J D 00J where the signs are given in the following table.

Here the p is the so called KO-dimension. We require also that ŒJaJ1; b D 0 for
all a; b 2 A, i.e. that JaJ1 is in the opposite algebra Aop.
For the spectral triple of a manifold the KO-dimension is usually taken to be
equal to the dimension of the manifold itself. In the ﬁnite case of matrix algebras
this requirement is dropped and it is precisely the fact that the KO-dimension and
the dimension of the spectral triple need not coincide that allows Majorana mass
terms for neutrinos.
That the abstract deﬁnition of a spectral triple gives for commutative A an
equivalent deﬁnition for a compact Riemannian spin manifold is the central content
of Connes’ reconstruction theorem. See Connes [7, 8] for an in depth proof of the
theorem and Sanders [9] for a very readable introduction.
Note that the deﬁnition of a spectral triple does not require that the algebra A
is commutative. It is precisely this possibility to pass to noncommutative algebras
which allows to generalise the frame work to noncommutative spaces.

Example To give an example of how to reconstruct geometric data from a spectral
triple let us consider the spectral triple of a manifold
.C1.M/; L2..†//; =@/:
As we have mentioned above, the dimension of the manifold M can be recovered
by Weyl’s law from the growth of the eigenvalues of =@. The metric distance
d. p; q/, p; q 2 M, can be reconstructed from Connes’ distance formula d. p; q/ WD
sup
f2C1.M/
.jıp. f/  ıq. f/j W jjŒ=@; f 	 1jj where ıp. f/ D f. p/ are ı-distributions. This
formula can be generalised to any spectral triple if we replace the ı-distributions by
states on the algebra.
Remark 2.6 Suppose we are given the algebra A, the Hilbert space H, the represen-
tation of the algebra , the real structure J and the chirality operator . Then these
data in generally do not uniquely ﬁx the Dirac operator D. In the case of the spectral
triple over a Riemannian manifold .M; g/ one may for example replace the Dirac
operator associated to the Levi-Civita connection by a Dirac operator associated to
any connection compatible with the metric g, i.e. by a connection with torsion [10].
One can also add scalar potentials [11] or terms of higher form degrees, as long as
they are compatible with the axioms. Here we will always assume that the Dirac
operator is associated to the Levi-Civita connection.
Deﬁnition 2.7 Given all the components .A; H; ; J; / of a real, even spectral
triple save the Dirac operator. Then the conﬁguration space of Dirac operators C.A/
is deﬁned to be
C.A/ WD fD W dom.D/  H ! Hj.A; H; D/ is a real; even; spectral tripleg
The conﬁguration space C.A/ is in general too big for applications in physics. So
one will usually choose a sub-space which has certain invariance or covariance
properties. In the case of particle physics models this will in general be the space
of generalised Dirac operator which can be interpreted as twisted Dirac operators
associated to suitable principal ﬁbre bundles.
It should be noted that spectral triples are tailored to describe Riemannian
manifolds. But it is quite clear that to model physical space-time one would need
a Lorentzian equivalent for a spectral triple. The endeavour to ﬁnd a suitable
replacement in the Lorentzian case proves to be an extremely difﬁcult task.
Some proposals have been made by Strohmaier [12], Paschke and Sitarz [13],
Besnard [14], Franco and Eckstein [15] and others. But no conclusive deﬁnition has
been achieved, yet. It seems that a major obstacle in the deﬁnition is the fact, that on
a Lorentz manifold the Dirac equation has no solutions in a suitable Hilbert space.
Solutions spaces of wave operators consist generally of tempered distributions and
are therefore not square integrable.

2.2
Almost-Commutative Geometries
Spectral triples have the nice property that the tensor product of two spectral triples
is again a spectral triple. This also holds for the even, real case with real structure and
chirality operator discussed above. Given two spectral triples .A1; D1; H1; J1; 1/
and .A2; D2; H2; J2; 2/ one constructs a new spectral triple .A; D; H; J; / with
the data
•
A WD A1 ˝ A2
•
H WD H1 ˝ H2
•
J WD J1 ˝ J2
•
 WD 1 ˝ 2
•
D WD D1 ˝ idH2 C 1 ˝ D2
If we want to construct particle models from spectral triples it turns out that such
products are very useful. In reminiscence to Kaluza-Klein theory one takes the
spectral triple of a compact Riemannian spin manifold and tensorises with a ﬁnite
spectral triple. A ﬁnite spectral triple is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.8 A ﬁnite spectral triple is given by a matrix algebra with m sum-
mands Af WD Lm
jD1 Matj.nj; Kj/, where nj 2 N, Kj D R; C; H, a ﬁnite Hilbert
space Hf WD CN and a Dirac operator Df 2 Mat.N; C/ such that .Af; Hf ; Df / with
suitable real structure Jf and f constitute a zero-dimensional spectral triple of KO-
dimension p.
One of the reasons why such ﬁnite spectral triples are useful in particle physics is
the fact that the group of unitaries U.Af/ WD fu 2 Af juu D uu D idg of the matrix
algebra can be identiﬁed, when properly lifted to the automorphisms of the Hilbert
space, with the structure group underlying the particle model. One can then interpret
the tensor product of the L2-spinors and the ﬁnite Hilbert space as a twisted spinor
bundle associated to the ﬁbre bundle product of the spin structure and a trivial vector
bundle associated to a (trivial) principle ﬁbre bundle associated to said structure
group. There are at the moment two approaches to deﬁne the structure group of the
particle model and we will come back to this point later.
In the context of particle physics the Hilbert space is the ﬁnite Hilbert space of
particle multiplets. In this case its rank N is even and one has to count particles
and anti-particles as well as left-handed and right-handed particles separately.
Consequently the Hilbert space is four times too big and the construction of the
Dirac action requires a projection on the physical Hilbert space. The Dirac operator
plays the rôle of the fermionic mass matrix and encodes the Yukawa couplings as
well as possible Dirac or Majorana mass terms. The real structure is then indeed
the charge conjugation operator from particle physics and the volume form can
be identiﬁed with the chirality operator that allows to project on left- and right-
handed spinors. It turns out that the KO-dimension should be chosen to p D 6 so
we will only consider this case. This choice of KO-dimension allows for Majorana
masses for right-handed neutrinos in the standard model, Barrett [16] as well as

478
C.A. Stephan
Chamseddine, Connes and Marcolli [17]. But such Majorana masses are in conﬂict
with the axiom of orientability [18]. KO-dimension six also implies that the number
of summands in the matrix algebra Af has to be even.
Deﬁnition 2.9 Given the spectral triple of a 4-dimensional Riemannian spin mani-
fold and a ﬁnite spectral triple, we call their tensor product an almost-commutative
spectral triple.
Example The standard example of such an almost-commutative geometry is the
spectral triple of the standard model. We will give the ﬁnite matrix algebra, its
representation on the Hilbert space and the Dirac operator in some detail to illustrate
the general structure of particle models in terms of spectral triples.
The ﬁnite algebra can be chosen to be
Af D C ˚ H ˚ M.3; C/ ˚ C:
We see that the group of unitaries is U.Af/ D U.1/  SU.2/  U.3/  U.1/. The
correct way to deal with the supplementary U.1/ terms to obtain the standard model
structure group GSM D U.1/  SU.2/  SU.3/ will be explained later. The ﬁnite
Hilbert space is taken from particle physics. It splits into four subspaces Hf WD
HL ˚ HR ˚ Hc

where the superscript c denotes the anti-particle spaces. One can choose as a basis
for the Hilbert space the particle multiplets of the standard model, i.e.

Note that the signs discriminating left-handed and right-handed particles change
from the particle sector to the anti-particle sector. This is due to the fact that we
construct a spectral triple of KO-dimension six.
A central object in the whole construction is the Dirac operator Df . It maps
left-handed particles to right-handed particles and vice versa but also contains
Majorana mass terms which map right-handed neutrinos to right-handed anti-
neutrinos. Therefore the conﬁguration space of Dirac operators consists of matrices

and refer to [17].
The ﬁnal spectral triple of the standard model is then the tensor product of
the ﬁnite spectral triple given above and the commutative spectral triple of a
4-dimensional compact Riemannian spin manifold .C1.M/; L2..†//; =@/. The
almost commutative algebra C1.M/ ˝ Af can be seen as the algebra of smooth
functions on M with values in the matrix algebra Af. We notice that the (lifted)
unitary group of C1.M/ ˝ Af is coordinate-dependent and therefore it can be
identiﬁed with the gauge group of a (trivial) principal ﬁbre bundle.
2.3
Classiﬁcations of Finite Spectral Triples
In consideration of the complexity of the standard model’s ﬁnite spectral triple one
could (and should) ask the question how unique or at least how special this model
is under certain extra assumptions. It therefore appears worthwhile to classify all
possible ﬁnite spectral triples and, if the general classiﬁcation turns out to yield too
many spectral triples, ﬁnd suitable conditions to single out spectral triple of interest
to particle physics.
A complete and general classiﬁcation has been performed independently by
Paschke and Sitarz [19] and by Krajewski [20]. Although the possible particle
models that can be built from ﬁnite geometries are strictly less than the models
which can be constructed in the classical formalism based on ﬁbre bundles, it is
nevertheless a far too big set. We will brieﬂy comment here on two proposals to cut
down this set of all ﬁnite spectral triples to sub-sets of potential physical interest.
Let us ﬁrst mention a recent classiﬁcation scheme proposed by Connes and
Chamseddine [21]. In this approach extra mathematical conditions are imposed
on the ﬁnite algebra and its representation. One assumes that the action of the
algebra has a separating vector and that the representation, i.e. the Hilbert space

Noncommutative Geometry and the Physics of the LHC Era
481
is irreducible. The second conditions demands that there are no nontrivial linear
projections acting on the Hilbert space which commute with the representation of
the algebra and the action of the real structure.
Applying these conditions to a ﬁnite matrix algebra one is essentially left with
two summands over the complex numbers, i.e. Af D Mat.k; C/ ˚ Mat.k; C/. If one
imposes as a further condition that the algebra should be symmetric under a certain
symplectic symmetry, one ﬁnds that only algebras of the type Af D Mat.r; H/ ˚
Mat.k; C/ are allowed. The commutation relations with the chirality operator then
require that r is an even number and the ﬁrst realistic model turns out to have the
algebra APS D H ˚ H ˚ Mat.4; C/.
We note that APS has a three-summand version of the standard model algebra as
a sub-algebra, namely C ˚ H ˚ Mat.3; C/  H ˚ H ˚ Mat.4; C/. It was shown
by Connes, Chamseddine and van Suijlekom [22] that the particle model of the
corresponding spectral triple is the well known Pati-Salam model.
An earlier classiﬁcation scheme was proposed by Iochum, Jureit, Schücker and
Stephan [23]. Here the idea was to put up a list of restrictions on the resulting particle
models, that appear necessary from the point of view of particle physics. The models
obtained from this classiﬁcation proved to be very useful for a bottom-up approach
in model building which has been exploited in [24, 25] and for the model [26] which
will be discussed in more detail below.
The requirements are such that the resulting particle model should
•
be irreducible i.e. to have the smallest possible internal Hilbert space (minimal
approach),
•
allow a non-degenerate Fermionic mass spectrum,
•
be free of harmful gauge anomalies,
•
have unbroken colour groups
•
and possess no charged massless Fermions.
Carrying out the classiﬁcation is a demanding combinatorial task [27] and has been
done for up to six summands in the matrix algebra Af [23] and can be summarised
as follows in terms of Af:
] summands

We call spectral triples with the matrix algebra Af D C˚Mat.2; C/˚Mat.n; K/˚C
of standard model type. The sub-algebra Mat.n; K/ is called the colour algebra.
The corresponding Hilbert space, representation of the algebra, real structure,
chirality operator and conﬁguration space of Dirac operators coincide in their

482
C.A. Stephan
general form with those of the standard model, thus the denomination. Note that
in this classiﬁcation scheme neither the number n of colours nor the ﬁeld K can
be determined. They rest as an input from experiment. Spectral triples with matrix
algebra Af D C ˚ C ˚ C ˚ Mat.n; K/ are called of electro-strong type since the
sub-algebra Mat.n; K/ is a colour algebra.
From the classiﬁcation follows that the standard model is indeed one of the
simpler models within the set of spectral triples. Furthermore the two types of
spectral triples we found from the classiﬁcation turned out to be very useful basic
building blocks to construct models beyond the standard model.
2.4
Gauge Groups
Up to now we have deﬁned spectral triples with their conﬁguration spaces of
Dirac operators and have classiﬁed certain interesting subsets. But the conﬁguration
spaces of Dirac operators is still far too big and we wish to constrain them by
specifying a gauge or structure group. The Hilbert space can be considered as a
space of sections of a vector (spinor) bundle associated to a principal ﬁbre bundle.
We will now deﬁne the necessary structure group for ﬁnite spectral triples with an
almost-commutative spectral triple.
Following Lazzarini and Schücker [28] we deﬁne the unitary automorphism
group of the Hilbert space of a spectral triple. It is a sub-group of the general
automorphism group of the Hilbert space and contains those unitary automorphisms
that are compatible with the structures of the spectral triple.
Deﬁnition 2.10 Let .A; H; D/ be a real, even spectral triple with real structure J
and chirality operator . The automorphism group of the Hilbert space is deﬁned as
AutA.H/ WDfU 2 End.H/jUU D UU D idH; UJ D JU;
U D U; U.A/U1  .A/g
where  is the representation of the algebra on the Hilbert space.
The last condition is called covariance condition. It ensures for example, that the
leptons and the quarks are charged under the same weak SU.2/-sub-group in the
case of the standard model.
Example For the standard model spectral triple one ﬁnds the following automor-
phism group of the Hilbert space [28]
AutAf .Hf/ D ŒU.2/w  U.3/c 
6
Y
jD1
U.3/=ŒU.1/  U.1/

Noncommutative Geometry and the Physics of the LHC Era
483
We notice that this group is larger than the standard model structure group U.1/ 
SU.2/  SU.3/. It contains family mixing unitaries Q6
jD1 U.3/ and can therefore
only be considered as a receptacle group for the true structure group.
In almost-commutativegeometry the true structure group is identiﬁed with the group
of unitaries of the algebra lifted to the Hilbert space or with a certain subgroup
which is then centrally extended. Let us ﬁrst give the deﬁnition of a structure group
following Connes and Chamseddine [29]. Assume that u 2 U.Af/. The lift of u to
the automorphisms of the ﬁnite Hilbert space is then deﬁned by
L.u/ WD .u/J.u/J1:
The structure group of the principal ﬁbre bundle is then Gcc WD fL.u/ju 2
U.Af/; det.u/ D 1g. The last condition is called the unimodularity condition. So
one can consider now the Hilbert space of the almost-commutative spectral triple as
the space of sections associated to the principal ﬁbre bundle P D PSpin ı PGcc where
PSpin is the natural spin structure.
A second approach that eliminates the need of the unimodularity condition was
developed by Lazzarini and Schücker [28]. It restricts the unitaries which are to
be lifted to the non-commutative unitaries Un.Af /, i.e. the unitaries of the non-
abelian matrix summands in the ﬁnite algebra. Here one apparently loses all the
U.1/-sub-groups which play an important part in the standard model. Yet, they can
be reintroduced by centrally extending the lift w.r.t. the determinant of the the non-
commutative unitaries. Let us denote this lift by L W Un.Af/ ! AutAf .Hf / without
giving the details (they are quite technical and we refer the interested reader to
[28]). But we note that the lift is not unique. In particular the central charges of the
central extension can be chosen freely. They are usually ﬁxed on physical grounds
by demanding that the resulting particle model be free of harmful U.1/-anomalies.
Deﬁnition 2.11 The structure group is in this case Gf WD fL.u/ju 2 Un.Af /g with
chosen central extension for the lift L.
In the extensions of the standard model we will usually work with this deﬁnition as
it proves to be more ﬂexible than the original one by Chamseddine and Connes.
We notice that the almost-commutative Dirac operator =@ ˝ 1 C dvol  ˝Df is
not gauge covariant and therefore not a Dirac operator induced by the associated
principal ﬁbre bundle P D PSpin ı PGf . So one deﬁnes the ﬂuctuated Dirac
operator Df . The ﬁnite Dirac operator Df gets promoted to an inter-twiner ˆ.Df / 2
End.L2..†// ˝ Hf / adapted to the principal ﬁbre bundle PGf . We will always
assume that the ﬁelds that constitute the inter-twiner are minimal in the sense that
for two sub-groups of Gf we only have one scalar multiplet of inter-twiners. This
assumption avoids the possibility of different Higgs ﬁelds for leptons and quarks.
We will also assume that the scalar ﬁelds that constitute the inter-twiner allow to
recover the ﬁnite Dirac operator if replaced by the identity, i.e. ˆ.Df / ! Df .
The derivative part =@˝1 gets promoted to a twisted Dirac operator =@˝1CP

Action Principles
One of the central objects in the noncommutative approach to the standard model
is the (covariant) almost-commutative Dirac operators. Therefore Chamseddine and
Connes proposed an action principle on the space of Dirac operators called spectral
action. This action has the disadvantage that it needs a Dirac operator with discrete
eigenvalues and is therefore only well deﬁned on compact Riemannian manifolds.
We will discuss this point brieﬂy when we consider alternative approaches to deﬁne
an action for Dirac operators.
3.1
The Spectral Action
The Chamseddine-Connes spectral action [29] for a spectral triple is deﬁned to be
the number of eigenvalues of the D in an interval Œƒ; ƒ where ƒ is a positive real
number. One usually considers the spectral action to be an effective action for the
gauge bosons which is valid at ƒ and subject to renormalisation when one wishes to
investigate different energy scales. For the fermions the action is given by the Dirac
action for D with a projection on the physical Hilbert space.
Since it is not possible to calculate the spectral action exactly from the above
deﬁnition, one smoothes the counting function and resorts to an alternative deﬁni-
tion which allows for approximate calculations. We take this approximation as the
actual deﬁnition of the spectral action.
Deﬁnition 3.1 Let f be a smooth cut-off function with support in Œ0; C1 which
is constant near zero and let ƒ 2 RC. The bosonic spectral action for the Dirac
operator D is

commutative spectral triple, i.e. it is of the form D D =@˝1CP

Assume further that the underlying manifold M is closed and dim.M/ D 4.
The calculations of the Seeley-DeWitt coefﬁcients are long but standard. So we
give here the ﬁnal results in a condensed notation. The a0-coefﬁcient is essentially
the volume of the manifold and will not concern us here. So we focus on the a2- and
the a4-coefﬁcient:

provide us exactly with the Lagrangian of a scalar ﬁeld that can act as a Higgs ﬁeld.
In particular they exhibit the “Mexican hat”-potential which can induce a symmetry
breaking mechanism.

486
C.A. Stephan
Note also that the quartic term for the scalar potentials as well as the Yang-Mills
Lagrangian for the covariant derivative appear in the same Seeley-DeWitt coefﬁcient
a4. If we decompose into the Yang-Mills Lagrangians of the sub-groups of the
ﬁnite structure group Gf and write it out in terms of the gauge coupling constants
we obtain relations among the quartic couplings of the scalar ﬁelds in the inter-
twiner ˆ.D/ and the gauge couplings [29]. These relations are not stable under
renormalisation group ﬂow and are therefore considered as boundary conditions for
the ﬂow, i.e. the spectral action is an effective action valid at the cut-off energy ƒ.
We notice furthermore that the trace of the square and the fourth power of the ﬁnite
Dirac operator Df also enter the relations among the quartic couplings and the gauge
couplings. In this way also the Yukawa couplings get involved.
Further restrictions on the Yukawa couplings can be obtained by normalising
the scalar ﬁelds to their proper mass dimension. In the present normalisation the
ﬁelds have mass dimension 2. It was discovered by Tolksdorf and Thumstädter [30]
that a proper normalisation of the bosonic and the fermionic action results in a new
constraint on the trace of D2
f , i.e. on the trace of the squared Yukawa matrix.
These constraints can be exploited to make the resulting particle models more
predictive than the usual models based on the differential geometric Yang-Mills-
Higgs approach. They provide extra boundary conditions at the cut-off energy which
have to match the measured values at other energies via renormalisation group
running.
3.2
Alternative Action Principles
Let give us give a short account on alternative approaches to action principles based
on a Dirac operator. The ﬁrst one is closely related to the spectral action. It is
basically another way to regularise the counting function for the eigenvalues.
Kurkov, Lizzi, Sakellariadou and Watcharangkool [31] recently proposed to use
a -function regularisation to give a well deﬁned value to the counting function of
the eigenvalues. The value of the -regularised spectral action can be given in terms
of Seeley-DeWitt coefﬁcients and turns out to be proportional to the a4-coefﬁcient.
This way of regularising the counting function is closely related to the deﬁnition
of the spectral action as Weyl anomaly as suggested by Andrianov, Kurkov and
Lizzi [32]. As the spectral action of Chamseddine and Connes this approach is only
well deﬁned on compact Riemannian manifolds. It was noted by Zahn [33] that the
Weyl anomaly, if calculated on a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold, leads to
similar results and may serve as a Lorentzian substitute.
A second approach which builds on a wider class of Dirac operators was
developed by Tolksdorf [34, 35]. Here the generalised Dirac operators contain also
curvature terms of the gauge connection as well as higher powers of the inter-twiner
scalar ﬁelds. Such Dirac-Yukawa operators can be decomposed naturally into two
terms D D =@B C !B (subscript B for Bochner) in the same way as one can write
the square of the Dirac operator in terms of the Bochner Laplace operator and a

Noncommutative Geometry and the Physics of the LHC Era

zero-order term D2 D B C VD. Tolksdorf notices [36] that the action functional

Z
M
tr.VD/
produces the bosonic action of the standard model (as well as the Einstein-Hilbert
action) for a suitable generalised Dirac operator of Yukawa type. This construction
does not depend on the signature of the metric on M. It is therefore perfectly suitable
in the Lorentzian setting.
4
Physical Predictions
Let us now return to the almost-commutative geometry of the standard model. We
wish to focus in this section on the constraints for the quartic couplings of the scalar
ﬁelds, the gauge couplings and the Yukawa couplings.
4.1
Constraints in Parameter Space
Calculating the full spectral action for the standard model is a long and tedious task
and we refer to the original publication of Chamseddine and Connes [29] for the
details.
The standard model has only one scalar doublet, the Higgs doublet, and only
one quartic coupling  in the Lagrangian. It has three gauge couplings g1, g2 and g3
corresponding to the sub-groups of its structure group Gsm D U.1/SU.2/SU.3/.
In the almost-commutative setting this structure group arises from Lazzarini’s and
Schücker’s lift of the noncommutative unitaries of the ﬁnite algebra Af D C ˚ H ˚
M.3; C/ ˚ C to the ﬁnite Hilbert space.
The ﬁnite Dirac operator Df contains then the Yukawa couplings and the Majo-
rana masses. Calculating the spectral action, normalising the ﬁelds and comparing
the terms in the a4 Seeley-DeWitt coefﬁcients leads to the following set of relations

4.2
Consequences for the Standard Model
Let us analyse these constraints for the standard model. We need to make some
extra assumptions. Namely we will assume the standard model particles constitute
the whole particle spectrum, i.e. we have a big desert. Furthermore we take the
experimental values of the gauge couplings at the mass of the Z-boson, i.e. g1.mZ/ D
0:3575, g2.mZ/ D 0:6514 and g3.mZ/ D 1:221 [37].
We also assume that the running of the couplings can be described by the
standard (1-loop) renormalisation group equations and that the top-quark and the
-neutrino Yukawa couplings dominate all other Yukawa couplings. We will take

A numerical analysis then shows that g2 D g3 at ƒ D 1:11017 GeV. The constraint
discovered by Tolksdorf and Thumstäter results in an upper bound on the top-quark
mass, mtop < 190 GeV. This is in good agreement with experiment, the experimental
value of the top-quark mass being mtop D 171:2 ˙ 2:1 GeV. Furthermore no 4th
generation of standard model particles is allowed as their masses were forced to be
smaller than the top-quark mass and should therefore be detectable.
The numerical analysis can be sharpened using the experimental value of the top-
quark mass as an extra input. This allows to calculate the value of the quartic Higgs
coupling  at the cut-off energy and then use the renormalisation group equations
to obtain a low energy value. This is the missing ingredient to calculate the Higgs
boson mass and one ﬁnds mH D 168:3˙2:5 GeV. Unfortunately the Higgs mass has
been measured by the LHC to be mH  125 GeV [40], so the almost-commutative
standard model is experimentally excluded.

One can also argue that the almost-commutative standard model has excluded be-
fore since 5
3 g1.ƒ/2 ¤ g2.ƒ/2. But this discrepancy has generally been considered
as less grim then the exact value of the Higgs mass.

Beyond the Standard Model
In view of the failure of the standard model within the setting of almost-commutative
geometry as well as the seeming experimental necessity of candidates for dark
matter particles it appears to make sense to search for models beyond the standard
model.
5.1
Different Approaches
We will focus on some of the ways to construct models that enlarge the particle
content of the standard model or change the gauge sector.
The classiﬁcation scheme of ﬁnite spectral triples as proposed by Chamseddine
and Connes [21] leads in general to extensions of the gauge sector w.r.t. the standard
model gauge group. The simplest viable example is a Pati-Salam type model [22].
Here the symmetry breaking mechanism is far more involved compared to the
standard model. This model produces several new scalar ﬁelds which may be used
to obtain the correct Higgs mass [41].
Another approach with relations to the classiﬁcation of Chamseddine and Connes
was put forward by Devastato, Lizzi and Martinetti [42]. Here the gauge group
is enlarged to incorporate also the Spin-group and a mixing of spinor degrees of
freedom and the ﬁnite Hilbert space. This allows to obtain a new scalar ﬁeld which
replaces the Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos and also leads to a Higgs
mass in accordance with experiment.
A different way to construct particle models was recently revived by Farnsworth
and Boyle [43]. They take up an earlier idea of Wulkenhaar [44] which replaces the
associative matrix algebras of almost-commutative geometries by non-associative
ones. Whether this will lead to interesting models beyond the standard model is still
under investigation.
Building on the classiﬁcation scheme [23] for ﬁnite spectral triples we proposed
a model building kit where one follows the following steps in order to obtain viable
extensions of the standard model:
•
ﬁnd a ﬁnite geometry that has the standard model as sub-model (tricky)
D> particle content, gauge group and its representation
•
make sure everything is anomaly free
•
compute the spectral action D> constraints on parameters
•
determine the cut-off scale ƒ with suitable sub-set of the constraints

C.A. Stephan
•
use renormalisation group equations to obtain low energy values of (hopefully)
interesting parameters (Higgs couplings, Yukawa couplings)
•
check with experiment! (and here we usually fail)
To ﬁnd a ﬁnite spectral triple with the standard model as a sub-geometry, it proved
successful to use the ﬁnite geometries of standard model type and electro strong
type. These can be combined to build bigger ﬁnite spectral triples which contain in
general new fermions and new gauge bosons. Whether the new model meets all the
constraints imposed by further theoretical requirements, such as being free of gauge
anomalies, or withstands the confrontation with experiment is often a non-trivial
question.
5.2
An Interesting Example
To illustrate viable extensions of the standard model building on the classiﬁcation
[23] we will sketch the model prosed in [26]. The matrix algebra of the internal
space is
Af WD C ˚ M2.C/ ˚ M3.C/ ˚ C ˚6
iD1 Ci
By a centrally extended lift in the sense of [28] one ﬁnds that the structure group of
the model is simply the standard model group with an extra U.1/ factor. So we have
Gf D U.1/Y  SU.2/w  SU.3/c  U.1/X
The ﬁnite Hilbert space is extended and has, additionally to the particles of the
standard model, the following fermion content in each generation:
X1
l ˚ X2
l ˚ X3
l W .0; 1; 1; C1/ ˚ .0; 1; 1; C1/ ˚ .0; 1; 1; 0/

Vw
` ; Vw
r W .0; N2; 1; 0/
Vc
`; Vc
r W .1=6; 1; N3; 0/
where we have given the representations of the structure group and thus the
dimension of the subspaces in a short hand notion. So for the Vw particles are in
the conjugate of the fundamental representation of the SU.2/w sub-group and are
neutral to all other sub-groups. They also couple vectorially to SU.2/w (left-right-
symmetric) and therefore form a C24 sub-Hilbert space since the anti-particles and
three generations have also to be taken into account.
The model has also a new scalar ﬁeld  W .0; 1; 1; C1/. We see that all the X-type
particles and the new scalar ﬁeld do not couple to the standard model subgroup
while the V-particle have vectorial couplings and therefore their masses should be
of the order of the cut-off scale of the effective theory, i.e. the spectral action.

Noncommutative Geometry and the Physics of the LHC Era
491
From the spectral action we ﬁnd the Lagrangians that have to be added to the
standard model Lagrangian. For the fermions and the gauge bosons we have
Lferm Dg;X1 NrX1
` C NX1
`mXX1
r C gX2 NX2

` mwVw
r C h:c:
Lgauge D 1

F	
X FX;	:
To keep the everything notationally short we only gave the fermionic Lagrangian
for one generation. The full Lagrangian contains also CKM-type matrices for the
X-particles.
For the scalar sector we write the full potential where we include the Higgs
ﬁeld H:
Lscalar D 	2
1jHj2  	2
2jj2 C 1
6 jHj4 C 2
6 jj4 C 3
3 jHj2jj2
Then the symmetry breaking pattern
U.1/Y  SU.2/w  SU.3/c  U.1/X ! U.1/e`:  SU.3/c  Z2
implies that the model has a new massive vector boson associated to the broken
U.1/X sub-group.
So the set of free parameters becomes larger with new Yukawa couplings for the
X-particles new quartic couplings 2 and 3, a new gauge coupling g4 and Dirac
mass terms for the X- and V-particles. But also the set of constraints from the
spectral action becomes larger. We ﬁnd the following boundary conditions on the
couplings at the cut-off energy ƒ:

where we again assumed that the top-quark and the -neutrino Yukawa coupling
dominate the Yukawa couplings of the standard model particles.
From a renormalisation group analysis we ﬁnd then that all of the constraints
can be met at ƒ  2  1018 GeV. The masses of the scalar ﬁelds do now depend
on the three couplings 1, 2 and 3. Their mass matrix is not diagonal anymore
and the free parameter in the mass matrix for the mass eigenvalues is the vacuum
expectation value of the new scalar ﬁeld. See Fig. 1 for a plot of the eigenvalues
w.r.t. the vacuum expectation value. The straight horizontal line is at 125 GeV, i.e.
the mass of the standard model Higgs.
If we require the smaller mass eigenvalue to be the experimental value of the
Higgs mass and also put in the experimental value of the top-quark mass with mtop 
172:9 ˙ 1:5 GeV we ﬁnd the following values for the remaining parameters
•
mtop  172:9 ˙ 1:5 GeV

The quite substantial errors on these predictions originate in the very ﬂat slope of
the lower mass eigenvalue, i.e. small errors in the Higgs mass translate into large
errors in the second mass eigenvalue and therefore in the other mass terms which
depend on it. Whether this model is already excluded is an open question. But such
types of models are referred to as dark sector models with a Higgs portal in the
particle physics literature and they seem to be quite difﬁcult to rule out.

Challenges for the Future
Let us just mention a couple of challenges and open questions that come into mind
in the context of noncommutative geometry and models beyond the standard model.
One of the major open problems in particle physics at the time is probably the
lack of mass in the universe. It appears that at least 60 % of the matter we observe
astronomically via gravitational effects is unaccounted for by the standard model.
So wether models as those discussed above contain viable dark matter candidates
seems a pressing question.
On a more fundamental point it is necessary to mention one of the major short-
comings of the almost-commutative approach to the standard model. The “space-
time”, i.e. the manifold on which part of the spectral triple is built needs to be of
Riemannian signature and has to be compact. This is in stark disagreement with the
universe we observe and which we model by a non-compact Lorentzian manifold.
For some proposals to solve this problem we refer to Strohmaier [12], Paschke and
Sitarz [13], Besnard [14] and Franco and Eckstein [15].
A solution to either of these problems within the context of noncommutative
geometry would certainly be a substantial breakthrough.

Introduction
One of the major aims in Riemannian geometry is to ﬁnd metrics with nice
properties on a given Riemannian manifold. The most common approach to this
problem is to detect such metrics as critical points of a geometric functional.
Einstein metrics are of particular importance since they satisfy the Einstein equation
from general relativity.
Let Mn be a compact manifold of dimension n  3 and let M be the set of smooth
Riemannian metrics on it. Einstein metrics can be variationally characterized as
critical points of the Einstein-Hilbert action

restricted to metrics of some ﬁxed volume [23]. It is well-known that Einstein
manifolds are neither local maximum nor minimum of the Einstein-Hilbert action
[34]. In fact, both index and coindex of S00 are inﬁnite on any Einstein space.
However, there is a notion of stability which is as follows: We say that an Einstein
manifold is stable if S00.h/ 	 0 for any h 2 .S2M/ satisfying trh D 0 and ıh D 0.
Such tensors are called transverse traceless. These tensors form the L2-orhogonal
complement of the orbit of the diffeomorphism group acting on the conformal class
of g. We call the manifold strictly stable, if S00.h/ < 0 for all nonzero transverse
traceless tensors.
This stability concept plays an important role in mathematical physics. In [1],
Andersson and Moncrief proved nonlinear stability (as solutions of the Einstein
equation) of Lorentz cones over compact Einstein metrics of negative scalar
curvature under the assumption that the compact Einstein metric is stable in the
above sense.
Compact Einstein metrics are also used to construct higher-dimensional solutions
of the Einstein equation which are considered as background metrics in higher
dimensional gravity theories. If the Einstein metric is unstable, there exist linear
perturbations of the background which are bounded in space but unbounded in time
which suggests nonlinear instability, i.e. small perturbations of initial data for the
Einstein equation may yield future incomplete solutions.
The stability condition in the sense of above also plays a role in dynamical
stability or instability of Einstein metrics under the Ricci ﬂow. The Ricci ﬂow is a
ﬁrst-order renormalization group ﬂow in string theory, and its solutions are believed
to approximate string ﬁeld theory processes in certain cases. The reason why these
stability concepts are deeply connected is that the second variational formulas of
Perelman’s entropies are given in terms of the Einstein operator.
This survey paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the notion of
stability of compact Einstein manifolds. In Sect. 3, we discuss the above mentioned

Variational Stability and Rigidity of Compact Einstein Manifolds

applications of this stability concept in mathematical relativity and string theory in
more detail.
In the next two sections, we present a variety of results on stability. Stability
theorems for Kähler manifolds and for spin manifolds are presented in Sect. 4. In
Sect. 5, stability theorems assuming certain bounds on the sectional curvature, the
Weyl curvature and the Bochner curvature are given. Finally, Sect. 6 presents some
results about inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations and the moduli space of Einstein
structures.

The Stability Problem
The second variation of S at Einstein metrics was considered in [26]. For details, see
also [3, Chapter 4]. It turned out that S00 admits a block diagonal form with respect
to the decomposition
TgM D .S2M/ D C1.M/  g ˚ Tg.g  Diff.M// ˚ tr1
g .0/ \ ı1
g .0/:
(1)
Here, ı W .S2M/ ! 1.M/ denotes the divergence. This decomposition holds for
any Einstein metric except the round sphere and all factors are inﬁnite-dimensional.
The ﬁrst factor of (1) is the tangent space of the conformal class of g. It
is known that S00 is positive on volume-preserving conformal deformations. By
diffeomorphism invariance, S00 vanishes on the second factor.
The tensors in the third factor are also often called transverse traceless or TT.
From now on, we abbreviate TTg D tr1
g .0/ \ ı1
g .0/. The second variation of S on
TT-tensors is given by

and R is deﬁned with the sign convention such that VRg D Ric.
Deﬁnition 2.1 We call the operator E W .S2M/ ! .S2M/, given by Eh D
rrh  2 VRh the Einstein operator.
This is a self-adjoint elliptic operator mapping TT to itself and by compactness
of M, it has a discrete spectrum, bounded from below and unbounded from above.

K. Kröncke
Deﬁnition 2.2 We call a compact Einstein manifold .M; g/ stable, if the Einstein
operator is nonnegative on TT-tensors and strictly stable, if it is positive on TT-
tensors. We call .M; g/ unstable, if the Einstein operator admits negative eigenvalues
on TT. Furthermore, elements in ker.EjTT/ are called inﬁnitesimal Einstein
deformations.
Example The manifolds Sn and CPn with their standard metrics are strictly stable.
Compact quotients of the hyperbolic space are strictly stable. The ﬂat torus is stable
but not strictly stable. The product metric on Sn  Sm is unstable.
Remark 2.3 Many unstable Einstein manifolds of positive scalar curvature have
been explicitly constructed [5, 16, 17, 19, 35, 36]. In contrast, no unstable Einstein
manifolds of nonpositive scalar curvature are known.
Question ([9, p. 65]) Are all compact Einstein manifolds with nonpositive scalar
curvature stable?
For the Ricci-ﬂat case, this question was already asked by Kazdan and Warner
[24, p. 315]. The question can be answered positively in certain cases, see
Sect. 4. The statement is not true in the noncompact case since the Riemannian
Schwarzschild metric is unstable (see [18, Sec. 5]).
Remark 2.4 If gt is a nontrivial curve of Einstein metrics through g D g0 orthogonal
to R  .g  Diff.M//, then Pg0 is an inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformation. Evidently, an
Einstein manifold is isolated in the space of Einstein structures (the set of Einstein
metrics modulo diffeomorphism and rescaling) if EjTT has trivial kernel.
Deﬁnition 2.5 An inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformation h is called integrable if there
exists a curve of Einstein metrics tangent to h.
Given a compact Riemannian manifold .M; g/, we call

the Yamabe invariant of the conformal class of g. By the solution of the Yamabe
problem, this inﬁmum is always attained by a metric of constant scalar curvature.
A metric realizes this inﬁmum is called Yamabe metric. Any Einstein metric is a
Yamabe metric. Moreover, any constant scalar curvature metric close to an Einstein
metric which is not the round sphere is a Yamabe metric [6, Theorem C].
The set C of unit-volume constant scalar curvature metrics close to an Einstein
metric g is a manifold with tangent space
TgC D Tg.g  Diff.M// ˚ TT
and the conformal Yamabe invariant equals the value of the Einstein-Hilbert action
on such metrics. Moreover, we have a smooth map

given by the pointwise multiplication .f; Qg/ 7! f Qg, which is a local diffeomorphism
around .1; g/ [27, Theorem 2.5]. Thus, the map Qg 7! Y.M; ŒQg/ is smooth on a
neighbourhood of g, g is a critical point and the second variation of Y is only
nonvanishing on TT-tensors where it is given by .1=2/E. A local stability
condition would be to say that g is a local maximum of the Yamabe invariant. It
implies the inﬁnitesimal condition in Deﬁnition 2.2.

Applications in Mathematical Physics
We start this section with a global existence theorem on the Einstein equation, using
stability of a compact Einstein metric. In [1], Andersson and Moncrief consider the
Lorentz cone
Qg D dt2 C t2
n2 g
over a compact ndimensional Riemannian Einstein metric g with normalized
scalar curvature  n1
n . The metric Qg is a Lorentzian Ricci-ﬂat metric, in particular,
it solves the Einstein vacuum equations. One may now ask if this solution is stable
as a solution of an initial value problem for the Einstein equation.
Observe that the above solution is globally foliated by hypersurfaces of constant
mean curvature surfaces g.t/ D .t=n/2g since the second fundamental form of g.t/
is k.t/ D t1g.t/ and thus, the mean curvature is n=t. The CMC-approach is
essential in the proof of the following
Theorem 3.1 ([1, Theorem 8.1]) Let .M; g0/ be a compact Einstein metric of
scalar curvature  n1
n . Suppose the Einstein metric is stable in the sense of
Deﬁnition 2.2 and that all inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations are integrable.
Then for any initial data set .g; k/ close enough to .g0; n1g0/, the corre-
sponding solution of the Einstein equation is geodesically complete in the future.
Moreover, the solution is globally foliated by CMC hypersurfaces and the induced
metric on the hypersurfaces converges (up to rescaling) to an Einstein metric close
to g0.
The conditions on the Einstein metric are needed in order to get nice energy
estimates. One may also look at the linearized Einstein equation at the background
metric Qg. It can be seen that stability is needed to get a nice decay of the linearized
perturbations [1, Section 6.4].
Compact Einstein metrics are also used as building blocks for solutions to higher
dimensional gravity and supergravity theories. A ﬁrst example is a product of two
Ricci-ﬂat metrics .M  N; g ˚ h/ where .M; g/ is a noncompact four-dimensional
Lorentzian manifold and .N; h/ is some compact Riemannian metric. We now
consider solutions of the linearized Einstein equations on the product metric which
are of the form f  k, where f 2 C1.M/ and k 2 .S2N/. If Eh D k, f has to

502

satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation
. C m2/f D 0;
m2 D :
If  < 0, this yields to solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation with imaginary
mass and to linear perturbations of the spacetime which are bounded in space but
unbounded in time. Therefore, stability in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.2 enters naturally
as a condition for such spacetimes.
In the context of AdS-CFT correspondence, one considers the so-called Freund-
Rubin compactiﬁcation. Here, we have backgrounds which are of the form .AdS5 
M5; gst C g/ where .AdS5; gst/ is the ﬁve dimensional standard Anti-de-Sitter space
and .M5; g/ is a compact 5-dimensional Riemannian Einstein manifold of positive
scalar curvature [15].
We may extend to arbitrary dimensions of the products and consider solutions of
the form .AdSn1 Mn2; gst Cg/ with factors being Einstein and the scalar curvatures
related by
n1  1

Again we look at linear perturbations of the form f  k, where f 2 C1.AdS/ and
k 2 .S2M/. If Eh D k, f has again to satisfy the equation
. C m2/f D 0;
m2 D :
Due to the negative scalar curvature of gst, such a perturbation is considered to be
unstable if m2 < n11
4n1 scalgst which implies the inequality  <  n21
4n2 scalg [7].
Evidently, we call a positive Einstein manifold .Mn; g/ physically stable if the
smallest eigenvalue of the Einstein operator on TT-tensors satisﬁes

ore equivalently, the smallest eigenvalue of the Lichnerowicz-Laplacian on TT-

This condition is also known as the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound.
Another important model in higher-dimensional gravity theory are generalized
black holes. Given an Einstein metric .Mn; g/ with scalar curvature n.n1/, we can
deﬁne the Generalised Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetimes as

where m is the mass of the black hole. Observe that one recovers the standard
Schwarzschild metric if .M; g/ D .S2; gst/. These spacetimes are Ricci-ﬂat, so they
satisfy the vacuum Einstein equation. We now consider solutions of the linearized
Einstein equation which are of the form e!t'.r/r2  k where k 2 .S2M/ and
Ek D k. By the work in [17], it turned out that if  violates the Breitenlohner-
Freedman bound, we can construct a solution of the above form such that ' is
bounded and ! 2 R; ! > 0. This yields a linear perturbation that is bounded
in space but unbounded in time, which is considered as being unstable. It is very
interesting that the same eigenvalue bound on the Einstein operator ensures stability
in two completely different models.
To conclude this chapter, we discuss applications of stability in studying
dynamical stability and instability of Einstein metrics under Ricci ﬂow. Recall that
the Ricci ﬂow is a 1-parameter family of metrics satisfying the evolution equation

renormalization group ﬂow equation

and so the Ricci ﬂow equation appears as the ﬁrst loop order term of this
renormalization group ﬂow. Connections between Ricci ﬂow and renormalization
group ﬂow have been investigated a lot, see e.g. [8]. Ricci ﬂow has been used in the
context of stability of black holes and of anti de Sitter space, see [13, 22, 38].
The ﬁxed points of the volume-normalized Ricci ﬂow (which is more common
in the context of compact manifolds) are Einstein metrics. It is now natural to ask
how the Ricci ﬂow behaves as a dynamical system close to an Einstein metric.
We present recent dynamical stability and instability theorems which are closely
related to the stability concept above. In the Ricci-ﬂat case, the theorems are due to
Haslhofer whereas in the case of positive and negative scalar curvature, the results
were obtained by the author.
Theorem 3.2 ([20, Theorem F],[31, Theorems 5.4.13 and 6.4.7]) Let .M; g/ be a
compact Einstein manifold with Einstein constant 	 such that the Einstein operator
is nonnegative on TT-tensors, the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian
satisﬁes  > 2	 and all inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations are integrable. Let
k  3.

504
K. Kröncke
Then for every Ck-neighbourhood U of g, there exists a smaller CkC2-
neighbourhood V  U of g such that any (volume-)normalized Ricci ﬂow starting
in V stays in U for all time and converges exponentially fast to some Einstein metric
g1 2 U as t ! 1.
Theorem 3.3 ([20, Theorem F],[31, Theorems 5.4.14 and 6.4.8]) Let .M; g/ be
an Einstein manifold with constant 	 and suppose that all inﬁnitesimal Einstein
deformations are integrable. If the Einstein operator admits negative eigenvalues
or there is a Laplace eigenvalue contained in .0; 2	/, then there exists a nontrivial
ancient normalized Ricci ﬂow emerging from it, i.e. there is a Ricci ﬂow g.t/, t 2
.1; 0 such that limt!1 g.t/ D g.
Remark 3.4 The integrability condition can also be dropped. In this case, the
conditions on the Einstein operator in both theorems are replaced by the condition
that g is a local maximum of the Yamabe invariant (for dynamical stability) or that
it is not a local maximum of the Yamabe invariant (for dynamical instability). As
consequences, we possibly have to pull back the ﬂow by diffeomorphisms to make
it convergent and the convergence speed is just polynomially. In in particular, any
Einstein metric is either dynamically stable or dynamically unstable. For details, see
[21, 30].
Remark 3.5 Various dynamical stability results have also been proven in the
noncompact case [2, 12, 37]. In this case, there are some subtleties concerning the
falloff conditions of perturbations at inﬁnity. All in all, the results are much less
complete than in the compact case.

Stability and Additional Geometric Structures
In this section, we discuss some stability results from the literature which assume
the presence of additional geometric structures. Moreover, we sketch how these
structures are used in the proofs.
Theorem 4.1 ([11, Corollary 1.2]) Any Kähler-Einstein manifold of nonpositive
scalar curvature is stable.
The proof idea is essentially due to [29]. It turned out that the Einstein operator
preserves hermitian and skew-hermitian tensors. If h is hermitian, we deﬁne a 2-
form by .X; Y/ D h ı J.X; Y/ WD h.X; J.Y// and
H D .Eh/ ı J C 2	;
(3)
where H is the Hodge Laplacian on 2-forms and 	 is the Einstein constant. If h is
skew-hermitian, we deﬁne a symmetric endomorphism I W TM ! TM by
g ı I D h ı J;

Variational Stability and Rigidity of Compact Einstein Manifolds
505
and since IJ C JI D 0, we may consider I as a T1;0M-valued 1-form of type .0; 1/.
We have the formula
g ı .CI/ D .Eh/ ı J;
(4)
where C is the complex Laplacian. The assertion now follows from the fact that
H and C are nonnegative.
Since any Ricci-ﬂat Kähler-metric carries a parallel spinor and any negative
Kähler-Einstein manifold carries a parallel spinc spinor, Theorem 4.1 follows from
Theorems 4.2 and 4.4 below. However, the above formulas allow us to compute the
space of inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations in terms of cohomology classes. We
discuss this in more detail in Sect. 6.
Theorem 4.2 ([41, Proposition 2.4], [10, Theorem 1.1]) Let .M; g/ be a compact
Ricci-ﬂat spin manifold carrying a parallel spinor. Then .M; g/ is stable.
The idea is as follows: Given a parallel spinor, we associate to each symmetric
.0; 2/-tensor a spinor-valued 1-form by
‰W .S2M/ !.TM ˝ S/;
h 7!.X 7! h.X/  /:
Here, S denotes the spinor bundle of .M; g/ and h is considered as an endomorphism
on TM. Now a straightforward calculation shows that if h 2 TT,
D2 ı ‰.h/ D ‰ ı E.h/
for any TT-tensor g. Here, D is the twisted Dirac operator acting on the space
.TM ˝ S/. Since D2 is a nonnegative operator, .M; g/ is stable.
Now assume that the manifold is spin and there exists a real Killing spinor , i.e.
rX D cX   for some c 2 R, c ¤ 0. Any Riemannian manifold carrying a real
Killing spinor is Einstein with constant 4c2.n1/. For such manifolds, stability can
not longer be derived but a weaker result holds:
Theorem 4.3 ([17, Section 4.3]) Let .M; g/ be a positive Einstein manifold which
is spin. If .M; g/ carries a real Killing spinor, it is physically stable (i.e. stable in
the sense of the eigenvalue bound (2)).
The prove is similar as above. Using the Killing spinor , we can deﬁne the map
‰ as above and we get
.D  c/2 ı ‰.h/ D ‰ ı E.h/ C c2.n  1/2‰.h/:
where c is the Killing constant. Thus, the smallest eigenvalue of EjTT is bounded
from below by  n1
4 	 where 	 > 0 is the Einstein constant. To ﬁnish this section,
we mention a stability theorem in the spinc-case:

506
K. Kröncke
Theorem 4.4 ([11, Theorem 1.1]) Let .M; g/ be a spinc Einstein manifold with
nonpositive scalar curvature. If .M; g/ admits a parallel spinc spinor, it is stable.
Having a parallel spinc spinor , one deﬁnes ‰ as above, but now it is a map
‰W .S2M/ ! .TM ˝ Sc/ where Sc is the spinc spinor bundle. The Bochner
formula reads
D2 ı ‰.h/ D ‰ ı E.h/ C ‰.Ric ı h/  ‰.h ı F/;
where F is the curvature form of the line bundle of the spinc structure. It can be
shown now that
Reh‰.Ric ı h/  ‰.h ı F/; ‰.h/i 	 0
which implies that E does not have negative eigenvalues.

by Koiso. Let the function r W M ! R by be deﬁned as

Then .M; g/ is stable. If the strict inequality holds, then .M; g/ is strictly stable.
The proof is based on the Bochner technique. For the Einstein operator, we have
the formulas

The result now follows quite immediately.
One can estimate r in a purely algebraic way in terms of sectional curvature
bounds and one gets the following corollaries as consequences thereof:
Corollary 5.2 (Bourguignon, unpublished) Let .M; g/ be an Einstein manifold
such that the sectional curvature lies in the interval . n2
3n ; 1. Then .M; g/ is strictly
stable.
Corollary 5.3 ([25, Proposition 3.4]) Let .M; g/ be an Einstein manifold with
sectional curvature K < 0. Then .M; g/ is strictly stable.
In our work, we used the fact that the curvature tensor of any Einstein metric
admits the decomposition
R D W C
	
2.n  1/g  g;
(8)
where 	 is the Einstein constant of g and  denotes the Kulkarni-Nomizu product

where VWh.X; Y/ D Pn

free at each point p 2 M and therefore, w  0. Using the Bochner formulas from
above, we can prove
Theorem 5.4 ([33, Theorem 1.4]) An Einstein manifold .M; g/ with constant 	 is

	 n C 1

:
If the strict inequality holds, then .M; g/ is strictly stable.
This theorem shows that if the Weyl tensor is small enough at each point, the
manifold is stable. However, we were also able to prove a criterion involving an
integral of the function w:
Theorem 5.5 ([33, Theorem 1.5]) Let .M; g/ be an Einstein manifold with positive
Einstein constant 	. If

508
K. Kröncke
then .M; g/ is stable. If the strict inequality holds, then .M; g/ is strictly stable.
Observe that for large dimensions, the two above conditions are close to each
other. The main tool we use for the second criterion is the Sobolev inequality

which holds for any unit-volume Yamabe metric and any f 2 H1.M/. It is not hard
to see that the Sobolev inequality also holds for tensor ﬁelds. The proof follows
from an optimal combination of (6), (10) and the Hölder inequality.
As is well-known, the Weyl tensor is conformally invariant. It is then not hard to
show that the Ln=2-norm of w is conformally invariant. This allows us to deduce
Corollary 5.6 ([33, Corollary 3.7]) Let .M; g/ be a Riemannian manifold and let

In dimension 6, we also proved a stability criterion involving the Euler charac-

then .M; g/ is strictly stable. Here, OW is the Weyl curvature operator acting on two-
forms.
Here, the proof follows from the Gauss-Bonnet formula in dimension six, a
Bochner-type formula for the Laplacian of the Weyl-tensor and Theorem 5.5.
In the Kähler-Einstein case, the Bochner-tensor B measures the deviation of the
manifold of being of constant holomorphic sectional curvature. Similarly as above,
we can also prove stability criterions involving the Bochner tensor. We introduce
the function

Inﬁnitesimal Einstein Deformations
Let g 2 M be Einstein with Einstein constant 	 and volume c > 0 and let E the set
of all Einstein metrics on a ﬁxed manifold. We are interested in the structure of the
set of Einstein structures, that is the image of E under the quotient map ' W M !
M=Diff.M/.
An appropriate tool to describe this set is provided by Ebin’s slice theorem [14,
Theorem 7.1], which states the existence of a local slice of the quotient map '. More
precisely, we have a smooth submanifold S  M with tangent space ı1.0/ and
any metric close to g is isometric to a unique metric in S.
Now, let us discuss the result of [29, Theorem 3.1]: There exists an analytic
ﬁnite-dimensional submanifold Z of S such that TgZ D ker.EjTT/ and F WD
fQg 2 E \ S j vol.Qg/ D cg is an analytic subset of Z. If all inﬁnitesimal Einstein
deformations are integrable, we may choose S and Z such that F D Z. In particular,
the moduli space of Einstein structures close to g is a manifold in this case.
If .M; g/ is a product of surfaces .†i; gi/ i D 1; 2 with hyperbolic metrics,
F is a manifold which is locally diffeomorphic to the product of the Teichmüller
spaces of †1 and †2. By choosing surfaces of high genus, we can easily construct
Einstein metrics whose moduli space of Einstein structures is locally of arbitrary
large dimension [1, Section 3.4].
In the Kähler case, there exists an important result which allows to compute the
dimension of ker.EjTT/ for many examples.

K. Kröncke
Proposition 6.1 ([29, Corollary 9.4]) Let .M; g; J/ be a Kähler-Einstein manifold.
Then we have

where ‚ is the sheaf of holomorphic vector ﬁelds.
The proof basically relies on (3) and (4). By the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov
theorem [4, 39, 40], all inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations are integrable in the
Calabi-Yau case. In other words the moduli space of Calabi-Yau metrics (which
equals the space of Einstein metrics in a small neighbourhood of g) forms a smooth
manifold whose dimension can be explicitly computed. For example, its dimension
is 57 in the case of the K3 surface.
Let us turn to a different case where the dimension can be explicitly computed:
We consider are ﬂat connected compact manifolds, which are called Bieberbach
manifolds. It is well known that any Bieberbach manifold is isometric to Rn=G,
where G is a suitable subgroup of the Euclidean motions E.n/ D O.n/ Ë Rn. On
Bieberbach manifolds, we can explicitly compute the dimension of the space of
inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations.
Theorem 6.2 ([32, Theorem 1.1]) Let .M D Rn=G; g/ be a Bieberbach manifold
and let  be the canonical representation of the holonomy of G on Rn. Let
 Š .1/i1 ˚ : : : ˚ .l/il
be an irreducible decomposition of . Then the dimension of the space of inﬁnitesi-
mal Einstein deformations is equal to

 1:
We use the fact that ker.EjTT/ coincides with the space of parallel traceless
symmetric 2-tensors whose computation can be computed using holonomy theory.
All these deformations are integrable since the map t 7! g C th generates a family
of ﬂat metrics if h is parallel. In particular, all Ricci-ﬂat metrics close to a ﬂat metric
are also ﬂat.
Let us now turn to the case of product manifolds. Let .M; g1/ and .N; g2/ be
Einstein manifolds. If both manifolds have the same Einstein constant, the product
manifold .M  N; g1 C g2/ is also Einstein and we may ask how the moduli space

Variational Stability and Rigidity of Compact Einstein Manifolds
511
of Einstein metrics on the product manifold is related to the moduli spaces of the
factors.
Andersson and Moncrief studied products of negative Einstein manifolds. They
showed the following: Let E	.M/ and E	.N/ be the sets of Einstein metrics of
constant 	 on M; N, respectively. Let .M; g1/ and .N; g2/ both be stable Einstein
manifolds of negative Einstein constant 	 and suppose, all inﬁnitesimal Einstein
deformations are integrable, there exist slices S.M/; S.N/ and S.M  N/ of the
spaces of metrics in M; N and M  N such that
E	.M  N/ \ S.M  N/ Š .E	.M/ \ S.M//  .E	.N/ \ S.N//;

In [32], we discussed the same questions for Ricci-ﬂat and positive stable Einstein
metrics under the same stability and integrability assumptions. We showed that in
the Ricci-ﬂat case, (13) and (14) do not longer hold if both factors admit parallel
vector ﬁelds. If X; Y are parallel vector ﬁelds on M; N, respectively, the symmetric
tensor product h D X ˇ Y is an inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformation which is
integrable.
In the case of positive scalar curvature, there exists a large class of examples

On S2  CP2n there exist inﬁnitesimal Einstein deformations which are all of the

of the form in (15) can be integrable and whether (13) can be violated.
