Abstract: The application of quantum algorithms to the study of many-particle quantum systems
requires the ability to prepare wave functions that are relevant in the behavior of the system under
study. Hamiltonian symmetries are important instruments used to classify relevant many-particle
wave functions and to improve the efﬁciency of numerical simulations. In this work, quantum
circuits for the exact and approximate preparation of total spin eigenfunctions on quantum computers
are presented. Two different strategies are discussed and compared: exact recursive construction
of total spin eigenfunctions based on the addition theorem of angular momentum, and heuristic
approximation of total spin eigenfunctions based on the variational optimization of a suitable cost
function. The construction of these quantum circuits is illustrated in detail, and the preparation of
total spin eigenfunctions is demonstrated on IBM quantum devices, focusing on three- and ﬁve-spin
systems on graphs with triangle connectivity.
Keywords: quantum computing; spin liquids; eigenstates; quantum error mitigation
1. Introduction
One of the central goals of quantum mechanics is to determine the behavior of multiple
interacting particles. A fundamental and important example is the determination of the
eigenstates of spin Hamiltonians, especially those with possibilities of frustration. Of
particular “richness” is the behavior of spin liquids [1,2], and signatures of spin liquid
behaviors have been observed in a variety of magnetic materials [3–5].
Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter featuring topological order and long-
range quantum entanglement, which motivated the proposal and exploration of techniques
to engineer such systems for topological protection of quantum information [6,7]. To gain a
more profound understanding of quantum spin liquids requires concerted experimental
and computational efforts.
Digital quantum computers have been proposed as alternative and complementary
approaches to the exploration of these strongly correlated quantum phases [8,9]. Systems
with frustration caused by the lattice geometry or long-range interactions have been iden-
tiﬁed as promising avenues in the search for quantum spin liquids [10–16]. Spin liquid
behavior in frustrated quantum systems has been explored with a variety of computational
platforms, namely annealers [17], superconducting quantum circuits [18,19], and atom
arrays [20].
Hamiltonian symmetries play a central role in the classiﬁcation of Hamiltonian eigen-
functions, and in improving the efﬁciency and the accuracy of algorithms for the solution
of the Schrödinger equation. The incorporation of symmetries in quantum simulation
algorithms is an active research area with many important declinations, including qubit

reduction [21–25], the careful design of state preparation circuits [26], the introduction of
symmetry violation penalties [27], and the adoption and reﬁnement of post-selection and
error-mitigation techniques. An important example, particularly for spin Hamiltonians, is
spin symmetry: when a Hamiltonian operator ˆH commutes with the total spin and spin-z
operators, respectively, ˆS2 and ˆSz, there exists a basis of simultaneous eigenfunctions of ˆH
and such constants of motion. Spin symmetry is encountered across a wide variety of situa-
tions relevant for the characterization of spin liquid behavior: from the Heisenberg model
on a complete graph ˆH = ∑i<j Si · Sj = ( ˆS2 −∑i ˆS2
i )/2, to spin Hamiltonian providing a
minimal model of magnetic correlations in molecular systems [28,29], and the electronic
structure of molecules and materials [30–34].
In this work, we explore quantum circuits for the synthesis of spin eigenfunctions
on quantum computers. Previous approaches typically concentrated on circuits for ex-
act or controllably approximated encoding of general spin eigenstates [35] that require
quantum resources (ancillae and multi-controlled multi-qubit gates) often beyond the
capabilities of contemporary quantum hardware, or circuits for encoding of speciﬁc spin
eigenstates [36,37], which have less generality but require less quantum resources.
Here, we investigate the balances among generality, accuracy, and computational costs
in the encoding of spin eigenfunctions by quantum circuits, by pursuing two approaches:
an exact recursive construction of spin eigenstates and a heuristic variational construction
of approximate spin eigenstates.
The remainder of the present work is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the
two families of circuits studied in this work. In Section 3, we apply the proposed circuits
to systems of three- and ﬁve-spin-1/2 particles on graphs with triangle connectivities,
using classical simulators of quantum computers and quantum hardware. Conclusions are
drawn in Section 4, and additional theoretical and implementation details are presented in
the Appendixes A and B.
2. Methods
In this section, we describe our approaches to encode spin eigenstates on quantum
computers. The exact recursive construction is presented in Section 2.1, focusing on the
structure and computational cost of the corresponding quantum circuits. The heuristic
variational construction is presented in Section 2.2, focusing on the Ansätze proposed and
tested in the present work.
2.1. Exact Recursive Construction
In this section, we consider a system of n spin- 1
2 particles, and our aim is to prepare
such a system in an eigenfunction |ℓ, m⟩of the total spin operators ˆS2 and ˆSz with eigen-
values ℓ(ℓ+ 1) and m, respectively, with ℓ= k/2, k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} and m = −ℓ, . . . , ℓ.
Following an established convention, we map the Hilbert space of a single spin-up particle
onto that of a single qubit as
|ℓ= 1/2, m = 1/2⟩→|0⟩,
|ℓ= 1/2, m = −1/2⟩→|1⟩.
(1)
A single qubit can thus be prepared in a spin eigenfunction by applying to the initial
state |0⟩one of the following unitary transformations,
ˆUℓ=1/2,m=1/2 = 1,
ˆUℓ=1/2,m=−1/2 = X,
(2)
where X denotes the Pauli X operator, deﬁned in Appendix B. A register of n = 2 qubits
can be prepared in a total spin eigenfunction using the quantum circuit shown in Figure 1,
which uses a single CNOT gate, also deﬁned in Appendix B.

representation of the total spin eigenfunction |ℓ, m⟩for n = 2 qubits, and gates Gℓ,m used to encode it.
In the remainder of this section, we will present a recursive procedure to prepare n ≥2
qubits in a total spin eigenfunction. For n = 2, such a preparation was shown in Figure 1.
Let us now show that the possibility to prepare n ≥2 qubits into a total spin eigen-
function implies the possibility to prepare n + 1 qubits into a total spin eigenfunction. The
starting point is the angular momentum addition theorem,
|ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ, m⟩= ∑
m1,m2
Cℓ,m
ℓ1,m1,ℓ2,m2 |ℓ1, m1⟩⊗|ℓ2, m2⟩
(3)
where |ℓ1, m1⟩, |ℓ2, m2⟩, and |ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ, m⟩are eigenfunctions of the total spin operators
with eigenvalues ℓ1, m1, ℓ2, m2, and ℓ, m, respectively, and Cℓ,m
ℓ1,m1,ℓ2,m2 is a Clebsch–Gordan
coefﬁcient. Here, our goal is to map |ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ, m⟩onto a wave function of n + 1 qubits. To
this end, let us consider the case ℓ2 = 1/2, so that Equation (3) takes the form
|ℓ1, 1/2, ℓ, m⟩= ∑
m2
ψm2 |ℓ1, m −m2⟩⊗|1/2, m2⟩,
ψm2 = Cℓ,m
ℓ1,m−m2,1/2,m2.
(4)
By the induction hypothesis, |ℓ1, m −m2⟩can be mapped onto an n-qubit wave func-
tion applying a quantum circuit ˆUℓ1,m−m2 to a register of n qubits prepared in |0⟩⊗n. Writing
ψ1/2 = cos(θ/2),
ψ−1/2 = sin(θ/2)
(5)
for a suitable angle θ ∈[0, 2π) shows that the state |ℓ1, 1/2, ℓ, m⟩can be mapped onto an
(n + 1)-qubit wave function, applying either of the the unitary transformations

to a register of n + 1 qubits prepared in |0⟩⊗(n+1). In Equations (6) and (7), Ry,i(θ) =
exp(−iθYi/2) is a Y rotation of an angle θ applied to qubit i, and the symbols ci and ci
indicate application of a unitary transformation when qubit i is in |0⟩or |1⟩, respectively.
The unitary transformations in Equations (6) and (7) are equivalent to the quantum circuits
shown in Figure 2.

other, and Equations (6) and (7), respectively.

As a simple and relevant example, in Figure 3, we apply the exact recursive construc-
tion to n = 3 spins. The gates G0, G′
0, G1, G′
1 are deﬁned as in the right portion of Figure 1,
and implement the unitaries ˆUℓ01,m−1/2 and ˆUℓ01,m+1/2, respectively, with

Comparing Figures 2b and 3, this show that the latter circuit is simpliﬁed, in order to
remove redundant gates.

Computational Cost
Compared against previous approaches, the exact recursive construction presented
here requires no ancillae [35], and applies to generic spin eigenfunctions [36]. However, it
requires a number of single-qubit and CNOT gates scaling exponentially with n.
This circumstance can be understood considering the structure in Figure 2. Construct-
ing an (n + 1)-qubit total spin eigenfunction requires two controlled n-qubit circuits and
a single-qubit Y rotation. Denoting cn, sn the number of CNOT and single-qubit gates
comprising the n-qubit circuit, respectively, one can easily see that the n(+1)-qubit circuit
requires cn Toffoli, sn controlled single-qubit gates, and one additional single-qubit gate. By
Lemmas 6.1 and 5.4 of [38], respectively, a Toffoli gate requires 8 CNOT and six single-qubit
gates, and a controlled single-qubit gate requires two CNOT and two single-qubit gates.
Therefore, cn+1 = 16cn + 4sn and sn+1 = 12cn + 4sn.
Numeric integration of these recursion relations, with the initial conditions c2, s2 = 1, 2
as seen in Figure 2, gives cn, sn ≃3n, which is exponential in the number of qubits.
We remark that, in practice, circuit simpliﬁcation techniques can lower this gate count,
especially for total spin eigenfunctions with low entanglement.
2.2. Heuristic Variational Construction
The high computational cost of exact construction techniques for arbitrary spin eigen-
functions makes it desirable to propose less-expensive alternative strategies that are more
suited to contemporary quantum devices. In this section, we present a technique for
heuristic variational construction of approximate total spin eigenfunctions.
Simulations of many-body ground and excited states on contemporary quantum
hardware frequently make use of parametrized families of wave functions, of the form
|Ψ(θ)⟩= ˆU(θ)|Ψ0⟩, where ˆU(θ) is a quantum circuit comprising free parameters, and |Ψ0⟩
is an initial wave function [39]. The best approximation to a target state within the set
|Ψ(θ)⟩is chosen by minimizing a suitable cost function with respect to the parameters θ
in the quantum circuit. A prominent example is the variational quantum eigensolver [40],
where the target state is the ground state of a Hamiltonian operator ˆH, and the cost function
is the expectation value E(θ) = ⟨Ψ(θ)| ˆH|Ψ(θ)⟩of the Hamiltonian over the state |Ψ(θ)⟩.
A natural choice for the cost function is
Cℓ,m(θ) =

⟨ˆSz⟩−m
2
+

⟨ˆS2⟩−ℓ(ℓ+ 1)
2
(9)
where ⟨·⟩denotes expectation value of an operator over the state Ψ(θ). In the present
work, we also consider the possibility to ﬁx the total spin of one or more qubit subsets

Symmetry 2022, 14, 624
5 of 17
Ω1, . . . , Ωr ⊂{0 . . . n −1} to a target value, respectively, ℓ1, . . . , ℓr. To achieve this goal, we
alter the cost function as follows,
Cℓ1,...,ℓr,ℓ,m(θ) = Cℓ,m(θ) +
r
∑
k=1

⟨ˆS2
Ωk⟩−ℓk(ℓk + 1)
2
,
(10)
where ˆS2
Ωk denotes the total spin of subset Ωk. The functional Cℓ1,...,ℓr,ℓ,m(θ) takes value 0
provided that Ψ(θ) is an eigenfunction of the operators ˆS2
Ωk, ˆS2, and ˆSz with eigenvalues
ℓk(ℓk + 1), ℓ(ℓ+ 1), and m, respectively.
The gradient of the cost function Equation (10) is computed using the chain rule,
and gradients of expectation values ⟨·⟩are computed analytically, rather than by ﬁnite
differences, using a suitable shift formula [41–45].
Ansätze
The quality of a variational simulation depends not only on the cost function, but also
on the underlying ansatz, i.e., the map θ →|Ψ(θ)⟩. In the present work, we explore several
Ansätze, with the goal of assessing and comparing their accuracy and efﬁciently in the
approximation of total spin eigenfunctions.
First, we consider the following Ry ansatz [46],

where |0⟩⊗n is an initial wave function, m is the number of qubits, Ry,i(θ) = exp(−iθYi/2)
is a Y rotation of an angle θ applied to qubit i, ciXj is a CNOT gate acting on qubits (i, j) ∈L,
and r is an integer denoting the number of times an entangling gate E followed by a layer
of Y rotations is repeated. The Ry ansatz is illustrated in Figure 4 for r = 3.

state |Ψ0⟩= |0, 0, 0⟩.
Next, we consider an ansatz inspired by time evolution. Reference [47] illustrated a
recursive procedure for the preparation of an n-qubit system in a total spin eigenfunction.
An (n −1)-qubit system is prepared in a total spin eigenfunction |ℓ, m⟩n−1 and coupled
with a qubit prepared in |1/2, 1/2⟩. The system evolves under the action of a Heisenberg
Hamiltonian with all-to-all coupling, ˆH = J ∑n−1
i<j=0 Si · Sj, leading to the wave-function
|Ψ(t)⟩= e−it ˆH|ℓ, m⟩n−1 ⊗|1/2, 1/2⟩= ∑
k=±1
ck(t)|ℓ+ k/2, m + 1/2⟩.

c+(t) =

,
c−(t) =

ℓ−m
2ℓ+ 1,
(13)
the state |Ψ(t)⟩is a total spin eigenfunction with eigenvalues ℓ, m. Motivated by this
result, following and adapting the construction of the QAOA method [48], we introduce

a variational form inspired by time evolution, shown in Figure 5. The Hamiltonian is
represented as

and in Figure 5a the time evolution operator is approximated with the following primitive
Trotter formula [49–52],

In Figure 5b, we further impose the following primitive Trotter approximation,

and substitute each unitary e−itJSi·Sj with a parametrized two-qubit gate of the kind shown

3. Results
Computational Details.
We used IBM’s open-source Python library for quantum computing, Qiskit [53]. Qiskit
provides tools for various tasks, such as creating quantum circuits, performing simulations,
and computations on quantum devices. It also contains an implementation of the VQE
algorithm, a hybrid quantum–classical algorithm that uses both quantum and classical
resources to variationally optimize the cost function, and a classical exact eigensolver
algorithm, against which to compare results. We then minimize the expectation value of
the cost function with respect to the parameters of the variational circuit. The minimization
is carried out through a classical optimization method [54–59]. In this work, we used
the conjugate gradient [59] on the noiseless and deterministic statevector_simulator
of Qiskit. We then used the optimized parameters to compute expectation values on
quantum hardware. We performed experiments on ﬁve-qubit devices available through
IBM Quantum Experience, each with a quantum volume [60] of 32, namely, ibmq_athens,
ibmq_santiago, and ibmq_manila [61].
Error mitigation.
We employed readout-error mitigation (EM) [62–65] as implemented in Qiskit Ignis
to correct measurement errors. We also used a noise extrapolation scheme, namely a
simpliﬁed form of the Richardson extrapolation (RE), which uses additional CNOT gates
at the minimum-energy VQE iterations to account for errors introduced by two-qubit
entangling operations [66,67]. More speciﬁcally, each CNOT gate in the circuit is replaced
with a product of 2k + 1 CNOT gates, cX →cX2k+1, and the expectation value Ak of an
observable is extrapolated with a linear ansatz,
Ak = Aextrapolated + (2k + 1)∆.
(17)

Symmetry 2022, 14, 624

Following reference [66], we call r = 2k + 1 the “noise parameter”.
Tomography.
An important goal of the present work is to assess how faithfully a quantum circuit
executed on a quantum device approximates a target wave function ψideal. To answer this
question, we compute the ﬁdelity
F(ρcircuit, ψideal) = ⟨ψideal|ρcircuit|ψideal⟩
(18)
between ψideal and the density operator ρcircuit prepared on the quantum hardware, and
the purity of the former,
P(ρcircuit) = Tr(ρ2
circuit).
(19)
The density operator ρcircuit is measured by quantum tomography [68], and Equations (18)
and (19) are computed on the statevector_simulator of Qiskit based on the measurement
outcomes.
Target problems.
In the present work, we consider systems of n = 3 and n = 5 spins on graphs with
triangle connectivity, illustrated in Figure 6. For three-spin problems, our goal is to prepare
total spin eigenfunctions starting from total spin eigenfunctions of the left spins (labeled
0,1 in Figure 6a). For ﬁve-spin problems, we start from total spin eigenfunctions of the
left spins (labeled 0,1 in Figure 6b and henceforth L), of the left and central spins (labeled
0,1,2 in Figure 6b and henceforth LC), and of the right spins (labeled 3,4 in Figure 6b and
henceforth R).

panel (b)).
3.1. Exact Recursive Construction
In Figure 7, we demonstrate the exact recursive construction for systems of n = 3 spins
prepared in the representative states |ℓ01 = 0, ℓ= 1/2, m = −1/2⟩and |ℓ01 = 1, ℓ= 3/2,⟩
m = −1/2. We focus on the evaluation of the total spin operators ˆS2
01 (total spin of qubits
0 and 1), ˆS2, and ˆSz. As naturally expected, the use of EM and EM + RE signiﬁcantly
improves the agreement between exact and simulated values for these quantities.
Two natural questions are whether the improved quality observed for the expecta-
tion values of spin operators translates to generic observables, and what decoherence
mechanisms are responsible for the deviations seen in raw hardware simulations.
To address these questions, in Table 1 we compute the ﬁdelity and purity of the
state ρcircuit, respectively, Equations (18) and (19). We observe F(ρcircuit, ψideal) < 1, which
mirrors the deviations between exact and simulated expectation values of spin operators.
Furthermore, P(ρcircuit) < 1 in raw hardware simulations, indicates that qubits are de-
polarized by decoherence. The combined use of EM + RE increases the ﬁdelity towards
one, indicating a more faithful representation of the quantities measured on the device.

ℓ= 1/2, m = −1/2. Although the trends seen for n = 3 qubits, especially the beneﬁcial
impact of EM + RE techniques, are conﬁrmed, a signiﬁcant difference exists between
Figures 7 and 9: in the latter case, error mitigation techniques do not close the gap between
exact and simulated expectation values. The same phenomenon is observed in Figure 10,
where we compute the ﬁdelities between exact and simulated total spin eigenfunctions, for
several representative states, using qasm_simulator and ibmq_manila. The different efﬁ-
cacy of error mitigation techniques for n = 3 and n = 5 qubits is an important observation
of the present work, and it will be discussed in detail in the conclusions.

3.2. Heuristic Variational Construction
In this section, we assess the accuracy and performance of VQE-based quantum
circuits for approximate encoding of total spin eigenstates. Unlike in the case of exact
recursive construction, variationally optimized circuits are not guaranteed to accurately
approximate all the total spin eigenstates. For each ansatz explored in the present work,
we thus begin our analysis by assessing the ansatz accuracy using classical simulators
of noiseless quantum hardware, and we ﬁnally demonstrate the corresponding quantum
circuits on IBM devices.
3.2.1. Ry Ansatz
In Figure 11, we show the optimized cost function Copt(ℓ01, ℓ, m) = minθ Cℓ,m,ℓ01(θ)
for the Ry ansatz with n = 3 qubits and the connectivity in Figure 4, as a function of the
ansatz depth r, as deﬁned in Equation (11). As seen, the choice r ≥2 ensures minimization
of the cost function within single numeric precision across all spin eigenstates. In Table 2,
we list the ﬁdelity between the state Ψopt = Ψ(θopt) and the target eigenstate |ℓ01, ℓ, m⟩.
As seen, the ﬁdelity is equal to 1 except for the Dicke states |1, 3/2, ±1/2⟩[69–73]. This is
not unexpected, as the Dicke states are the most entangled n-spin states and, therefore, the
most difﬁcult targets for a variational optimization.
In Figure 12, we compute the spin operators ˆS2, ˆSz and ˆS2
01 using qasm_simulator with
noise model from ibmq_athens and on the device ibmq_athens, and the Ry ansatz with depth
r = 3. Similar trends are seen in both cases, with the combined use of EM + RE systematically
improving results. It is clear that the noise models do not faithfully emulate the noise observe in
our experiments, as readily seen when comparing the data in Figure 12. Given that the results
are highly sensitive to noise affecting the qubits, it will be important to investigate these noise
sources further and determine the extent to which they can be mitigated.

While the combination of EM and RE reduces the deviations between exact and simulated
quantities, it does not completely remove them. To document this observation, in Figure 13,
we compute the fidelity between optimal exact total spin eigenstates and VQE wave functions
computed with statevector_simulator (seen in Table 2) and on ibmq_athens. As seen,
decoherence significantly affects the fidelities of the obtained wave functions.

3.2.2. Time-Evolution Variational Form
We now consider the time-evolution variational form. Unlike in the case of Ry, where
the initial state is customarily ﬁxed to |0⟩⊗n, here, the initial state is set to

|1, 3/2, −1/2⟩
|ψ(0)⟩= |01⟩+|10⟩
√

|0⟩
for
|1, 3/2, 1/2⟩
(20)
For r ≥2 repetitions, the time-evolution variational form returned Copt < 10−18 and
ﬁdelity F > 0.9999 for all total spin eigenfunctions, including Dicke states. On the other
hand, it should be noted that the better accuracy of the time-evolution variational form
corresponds to a higher computational cost, quantiﬁed in Table 3.
In Figure 14, we show the expectation values of the total spin operators for n = 3 qubits,
using the time-evolution variational form, computed with statevector_simulator (seen
in Table 2) and on ibmq_santiago. The higher computational cost of the time-evolution
variational form, compared with the Ry variational form, results in an increased sensitivity
to noise, and ultimately in a worse agreement between exact and simulated quantities, a
trend especially pronounced on the actual quantum device.

4. Conclusions
In this work, quantum circuits for the exact and approximate preparation of total
spin eigenfunctions on quantum computers were presented. We described two families

Symmetry 2022, 14, 624
13 of 17
of circuits, representative of two different approaches to address this problem. First, we
presented a recursive construction of total spin eigenfunctions based on the addition
theorem of angular momentum, which we demonstrated for systems of three- and ﬁve-spin
systems on graphs with triangle connectivity on IBM quantum devices. The approach
is simple to understand and implement, and it guarantees exact mapping of total spin
eigenfunctions on multi-qubit wave functions, without making use of ancillary qubits. On
the other hand, its computational cost is at worst exponential in the number of qubits,
which limits applications to large systems.
In addition, we presented a heuristic approximation of total spin eigenfunctions based
on the variational optimization of a suitable cost function. The approach does not guarantee
exact mapping of total spin eigenfunctions on multi-qubit wave functions. On the other
hand, the heuristic variational approximation lends itself to simulations on contemporary
quantum hardware, as it relies on families of quantum circuits whose computational costs
can, by construction, ﬁt within the computational budget allowed by a certain device.
We showed the effect of errors on the simulation of total spin eigenfunctions by
performing experiments on actual quantum devices. We observed that qubit decoherence
and gate errors cause signiﬁcant inﬁdelities between target and simulated wave functions.
The extent of such a phenomenon depends on the number of spins as well as on the
simulated circuit. We note particular problems with variational simulations of the most
strongly correlated states, such as the Dicke states for n = 3 spins, as well as topologies,
such as n = 5 spins in a bow-tie, with the four-way coordinated center spin.
Using the exact recursive construction, for n = 3 qubits and n = 5 qubits (as docu-
mented in Figures 8 and 10), inﬁdelities are ∼0.05 and ∼0.15, respectively, and roughly
consistent across various spin eigenfunctions.
Larger and less-uniform inﬁdelities are seen for n = 3 qubits when VQE is used
(Figure 13). These inﬁdelities translate into signiﬁcant deviations between the exact and
simulated observables, as seen in Figure 14.
We demonstrate the effect of state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques to reduce the
impact of measurement and gate errors on such results. To start with, systems with 3 qubits
will have less error than 5, due to the different size and topology of these systems.
Of particular signiﬁcance is the performance of the Richardson extrapolation, which
breaks down for some of the n = 5 qubits using the exact recursive construction (see
Figure 9) and some of the n = 3 qubits with very deep variational circuits (see Figure 14).
In the case of n = 5 qubits, we ascribe this effect mainly to the problem of frequency
crosstalk for the central qubit of the bow tie topology, which needs to couple to four other
closely valued (but different) frequency qubits. This problem will have to be solved if we
are ever going to look at strongly coupled spin qubits in spin liquids. Ideally, the next
system to study would be bow-tie (Figure 6) with the four corners (pairs (0,3) and (1,4))
also connected, with minimal connectivity.

Appendix B. Quantum Computing Terms and Symbols
In Figure A1, we illustrate the quantum operations used in the present work. Single-
qubit rotations are exponentials of single-qubit Pauli operators, for example, Rx(θ) =
exp(−iθX/2). Single-qubit Pauli operators are equal to special single-qubit Pauli rotations
up to a global phase, for example, X = Rx(π/2). Single-qubit operations in the Clifford
group (Hadamard, S and T gates) are equal to special single-qubit Pauli rotations up to a
global phase, namely S = Rz(π/2), T = Rz(π/4), and H = exp(−iπ/2(X + Z)).
The CNOT gate is sometimes denoted CNOTij, where i and j are called the control and
target qubit, respectively, and applies an X transformation to its target qubit (⊕symbol)
if its control qubit (• symbol) is in the state |1⟩, the cU can be written as a product of up
to two CNOT gates and four single-qubit gates, and the SWAP gate can be written as a
product of three CNOT gates, SWAPij = CNOTijCNOTjiCNOTij.
