MODULE-I 
 
INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS: 
 
             Electronics is the branch of science and engineering dealing with the theoty and 
use of a class of devices in which electrons are transported through a vacuum, gas or 
semiconductor. 
 
Signals: 
It contains information about a variety of things and activities. 
Example - Voice of the radio announcer, weather information 
Analog Signal: The signal magnitude can be represented at any instant of time by a 
sequence of numbers. 
 
Discrete Signal: It is a sequence of numbers that represent the magnitudes of the 
successive signal samples. 
 
Digital Signal: Signal is in the form of 0 and 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Frequency Spectrum of Signal: 
Any arbitrary signal is characterized by its frequency spectrum. The signal is 
represented in frequency domain. 
 
Fourier series:  It is an expansion of periodic signal as a linear combination of sine and 
cosine with different frequencies and amplitudes. It is applied to periodic signals. 
 
Fourier transform: Fourier transform can be applied to aperiodic signals to find the 
frequency spectrum. 

 
Low Pass Filter: 
• Filter that passes low frequency components of a signal but rejects the high 
frequency components of a signal is called as low pass filter. 
• Filters designed with passive components (Resistor, capacitor, inductor) are 
called as passive filters.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Behaviour of capacitor to frequency can be described as follows 
For f=0 (Low frequency) capacitive reactance of capacitor Xc=

For f=∞ (High Frequency) capacitive reactance of capacitor Xc=

=0So it 
acts as a short circuit 
Operation 
        For low frequency since capacitor is open circuited, current flowing in the      
        circuit is zero.  So the output voltage vout= vin 
        For high frequency since capacitor is short circuited, the output voltage across a   
        short is zero So the output voltage vout= 0 
        The frequency response curve can be shown as below

LPF as Integrator: 
• Output voltage (current) is directly proportional to the integration of the input 
voltage(current) 
• The time constant RC of the circuit should be very large as compared to the time 
period of the input wave. 
• The value of R should be 10 or more times larger than Xc. 
 
For high frequencies the capacitor has insufficient to charge up, its voltage is small. So 
the voltage across the resistor is approximately equal to the input voltage. 
                                   vin=VR

High Pass Filter: 
• Filter that blocks low frequency components of a signal but passes the high 
frequency components of a signal is called as high pass filter. 
• Filters designed with passive components (resistor, capacitor, inductor) are called 
as passive filters.  
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Operation 
        For low frequency Since capacitor is open circuited, current flowing in the      
        circuit is zero.  So the output voltage vout= VR=0 
        For high frequency since capacitor is short circuited, So the output voltage  
                                        vout= VR= vin 
        The frequency response curve can be shown as below

HPF as Differentiator: 
• Output voltage (current) is directly proportional to the differentiation of the input 
voltage(current) 
• The time constant RC of the circuit should be very small as compared to the time 
period of the input wave. 
• The value of R should be 10 or more times smaller than Xc. 
 
For high frequencies the capacitor has enough time to charge up. So the voltage across 
the capacitor is approximately equal to the input voltage.

Semiconductor: 
• Conductivity lies between conductor and insulator. 
• Forbidden energy gap 0.2-2.5eV. 
• At 0K a pure semiconductor behaves as an insulator. 
• Semiconductor materials show a reduction in resistance with increase in 
temperature. So said to have a negative temperature coefficient. 
Intrinsic Semiconductor: 
• Semiconductor refined to reduce the number of impurities to a very low level. 
e.g : Semiconductor in pure form 
• Group-IV elements. Si, Ge,  
Extrinsic Semiconductor: 
• To increase the conductivity, impurities also called dopant (Group III or V) are 
added to the pure semiconductor material and is called extrinsic Semiconductor 
(n-type or p-type). The process is called doping. 
• N-type Semiconductor- Pentavalent (As,Sb,P) atom is added to pure 
semiconductor. Diffused impurities with five valence electrons are called donor 
atoms. 
• P-type 
Semiconductor- 
Trivalent 
(Al,B,Ga) 
atom 
is 
added 
to 
pure 
semiconductor. Diffused impurities with three valence electrons are called 
acceptor atoms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

• Holes are the majority carrier in p-type semiconductor and electrons are 
minority carrier. In n-type semiconductor electrons are the majority carrier and 
holes are the minority carrier. 
 
Diode: 
 
• Solid state device created by joining the p-type and n-type material is called as 
semiconductor diode.  
 
No Bias (V=0) 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Absence of external voltage across the p-n junction is called the unbiased diode. 
Because of the density gradient electrons and holes diffuse and they combine 
leaving the ions unneutralised and are called uncovered charges. 
• The uncovered charges generate an electric field directed from n-side to p-side 
called as barrier field which opposes the diffusion process further. 
• Since the vicinity of the junction is depleted of mobile charges. Hence called a as 
depletion region. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Reverse Bias (VD<0V) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Positive polarity of the external bias VD is connected to n-type and 
negative terminal is connected to p-type. 
• The number of uncovered positive and negative ions will increase in the 
depletion region causing widening the depletion region which creates a 
great barrier for the majority carrier to overcome, effectively reducing 
the majority carrier flow to zero and hence the current due to majority 
carrier Imajority=0 
• The minority carriers which travels down the potential barrier remain 
unaffected and give a small current called the reverse saturation current 
denoted as Is. 
 
Forward Bias (VD>0V) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Positive polarity of the external bias VD is connected to p-type and negative 
terminal is connected to n-type. 
• External bias VD exerts a force on the mobile carriers to move them towards the 
junction. At the boundary they recombine with the ions and reduce the width of 
the depletion region. 
• The depletion region will continue to decrease in width as the voltage is increased 
further and a heavy flood of electrons will move from n-side to p-side giving the 
Imajority an exponential rise from p-side to n-side, 
• The minority carrier flow will not be affected by this because the conduction level 
is determined by the limited number of impurities in the material and the current is 

denoted by Is. 
The total current is given by  
 
                                             ID=IForward+IReverse 
                                                                         =Imajority - Iminority (Direction opposite) 
          
   In terms of reverse saturation current, ID can be written as 
                                             ID=Isexp( KT

Breakdown Condition: 
(a) Zener Breakdown 
• Too much of reverse bias across a p-n junction exert a strong 
force on a bound electron to tear it out from the covalent bond. 
Thus a large number of electron and hole pair will be generated 
through a direct rupture of the covalent bonds and they increase 
the reverse current and gives sharp increase in the characteristics. 
It is called zener breakdown. Diode employing the unique 
portion of the characteristics of a p-n junction is called zener 
diode. 
• Maximum reverse voltage potential that can be applied before 
entering the zener region is called the peak inverse voltage (PIV) 
or peak reverse voltage (PRV). 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
(b) Avalanche Breakdown: 
• With increasing reverse bias voltage, the electric field across the 
junction of a diode increases. At a certain value of the reverse 
voltage, the electric field imparts a sufficiently high energy to a 
thermally generated carrier. The carrier on colliding with an ion 
on its way disrupts a covalent bond and gives a new hole electron 
pair. This process is cumulative and gives an avalanche of 
carriers in a very short time. It is called avalanche multiplication. 
 
Diode equivalent Circuit: 
 
• Equivalent circuit is a combination of element properly chosen to 
best represent the actual terminal characteristics of a device or 
system in a particular operating point. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ideal diode in forward and reverse biased condition is as follows  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Diode Resistance levels: 
• According to the applied signal the resistance levels in a diode has 
following type 
1. DC or Static (DC signal) 
2. AC or Dynamic(Small AC signal) 
3. Average ac( Large AC signal) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CLIPPER 
 
It controls the shape of the output waveform by removing or clipping a portion of the 
applied wave. Half wave rectifier is the simplest example.It is also referred as 
voltage limiters/ amplitude selectors/ slicers. 
Applications:  
• In radio receivers for communication circuits. 
• In radars, digital computers and other electronic systems. 
• Generation for different waveforms such as trapezoidal, or squarewaves.  
Helps in processing the picture signals in television transmitters. 
• In television receivers for separating the synchronizing signals from 
composite picture signals  
 
 
 
 
 
Types of Clipper Circuit 
 
1. Series- Diode is in series with the source 
2. Parallel- Diode is in parallel with the source. 
 
• Clipper circuit which uses a DC battery is called a biased clipper.

Example of Other Parallel Clipper Circuits: 
 
 
 
CLAMPERS: 
 
• A diode and capacitor can be combined to “clamp” an AC signal to a specific DC 
level. 
• It must have a capacitor, a  diode and a resistive element. 
• For additional shift an independent DC supply can be introduced in the circuit. 
• The time constant τ=RC must be large enough to ensure that the voltage across 
the capacitor does not discharge significantly during the diode is nonconducting. 
Procedure to analyze a clamper circuit 
 
1. Consider the part of the input signal that will forward bias the diode. 

2. During the On state assume that the capacitor will charge up instantaneously to a 
voltage level determined by the network. 
3. Assume that during the diode is in OFF sate the capacitor will hold on to its 
established voltage level. 
4. The polarity of Vo must be same throughout the analysis. 
5. Total swing of the total output must match the swing of the input signal. 
 
-ve clamper analysis: 
 
-Diode is ON(Short Circuit) in the positive half cycle. 
- Established voltage level on the capacitor 
Vc=V 
-During negative half cycle the diode is OFF and the 
output voltage is 
Vo=VR= -Vi-Vc  = -2V 
-Total swing of output is -2V which is same as the total 
swing of the input. 
 
Biased Clamper Circuit: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-ve half cycle: 
 
Diode is ON (S.C). So applying KVL around the input 
loop we have 
                             -20+Vc=5=0 
Vc=25v and Vo=5v 
 
During +ve half cycle diode is OFF. Applying KVL 
around the outside loop we have 
                      10+25-Vo=0 
                       Vo=35v 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of the Clamper Circuit: 
 
RECTIFIERS 
 
An important application of “regular” diodes is in rectification circuits. These 
circuits are used to convert AC signals to DC in power supplies. 
 
A block diagram of this process in a DC power supply is shown below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Half-Wave Rectifier: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The above circuit is called as a Half-wave rectifier since it will generate a waveform 
vothat will have an average value of particular use in the ac-to-dc conversion process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During 0-

 (Positive Half Cycle) the diode is ON. Assuming an ideal diode with no 
voltage drop across it the output voltage vo will be 
vo= VR=Vm 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During 

 -T(Negative Half Cycle) the diode is OFF(Open Circuit). So the current flowing 
through the circuit will be 0. The output voltage vo will be                                
 
vo= VR=i x R = 0 
 
 
Figure shows the input and output waveform with output 
Vdc=0.318Vm. 
 
 

Disadvantage: 
1. The ac supply delivers power only half the time. 
2. Pulsating current frequency is equal to the supply frequency. 
 
Full wave Rectifier: 
 
The full wave rectifier utilizes both the positive and negative portions of the input 
waveform. Types of full wave rectifier are 
 
(a) Centre tapped configuration 
(b) Bridge configuration 
 
Centre tapped configuration: 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Current flows through the load resistance in the same direction during the full 
cycle of the input signal. 
• Centre tap transformer is used with the secondary winding. 
 
+ve Half Cycle: 
 
• Diode D1 is short circuited and D2 is open circuited. Current flows through the 
upper half of the secondary winding. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

-ve Half Cycle: 
• Diode D2 is short circuited and D1 is open circuited. Current flows through 
the lower half of the secondary winding. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Complete input and output waveform can be shown as 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While this full-cycle rectifier is a big improvement over the half-cycle, there 
are some disadvantages. 
 
Disadvantages: 
• It is difficult to locate the centre tap on the secondary winging. 
• The diodes must have high PIV. 
 
BridgeRectifier: 
  
The bridge rectifier uses four diodes connected in bridge pattern. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The operation ofthe bridge rectifier can be summarized as: 
+ve Half Cycle: 
• Diode D1 and D3 are short circuited and D2 and D4 are open circuited. 
Current flows through D1 and D3 to give the output voltage across the 
resistor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-ve Half Cycle: 
• Diode D1 and D3 are open circuited and D2 and D4 are short circuited. 
Current flows through D2 and D4 to give the output voltage across the 
resistor. 
  
 
Complete input and output waveform can be shown as 
 
 
 
 
 
Advantages: 
• No centre tapped transformer is required. 
• PIV is less. 
Disadvantages: 
• It requires four diode and the power loss in the rectifier element is more. 

MODULE-II 
TRANSISTOR: 
1. Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) 
2. Field Effect Transistor (FET) 
Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT): 
• pnp-- n-type semiconductor is sandwiched between two p-type semiconductor. 
• npn-- p-type semiconductor is sandwiched between two n-type semiconductor. 
• It has three terminal naming E-Emitter, B-Base and C-Collector. 
• Both electron and hole responsible for the current conduction. So called bipolar junction 
transistor. 
• Doping wise-Emitter>Collector>Base 
• Two Junctions- JEB (Junction emitter base) and JCB (Junction collector base). 
 
 
 
 
 
Transistor Operation: 
• JEB is forward biased by the battery VEE by which the depletion region will decrease and a 
majority carrier flow will occur from emitter to base giving current Imajority or IE. 
• JCB is reverse biased by the battery VCC by which the depletion region will increase and a 
minority carrier flow will occur from base to collector giving current Iminority. 
• When both the battery supplies are given simultaneously the holes in the base region due 
to the battery VEE will act as minority carrier. They will cross the base region to reach the 
collector giving the current IC. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So the current equations of BJT can be written as 
                                               IE= IC+ IB 
                                               IC= Imajority+ Iminority 
                                               IC =α IE+ ICO 
Where α is defined as the fraction of the total emitter current that represents holes which

    In this region JEB is forward biased and JCB is reverse biased. The collector current is

Where ICBO (also noted as ICO) is the leakage current called as collector to base leakage 
current when emitter is open. Since this current is very small in magnitude IC≈ IE. 
• Cut off Region: 
      Here both the junctions are reverse biased. The region below IE=0 characteristic is 
called as cut off region. In this region IC= ICBO and in the range of nano amperes. 
• Saturation Region: 
   Here both the junctions are forward biased. The region is to the left of the graph where 
VCB is slightly positive and IE=0.It gives an exponential variation in the collector 
current.JCB is forward biased means collector is positive with respect to base. It gives rise 
to a hole current flowing from collector to base and is opposite to the original flow due to 
the transistor action. Output resistance of CB is very high because a very large change in 
collector voltage cases a very small change in collector current.

Input Characteristics:  
• Graph is plotted between input voltage VBE and input 
current IB keeping output voltage VCE as a parameter. 
• Characteristics are similar to that of a forward biased 
diode. For a constant VBE the magnitude of the base 
current decreases. With increasing VCE. This is because 
increasing VCE the effective base width and hence the 
recombination base current decreases.

• Graph is plotted between output voltage VCE and 
output current IC keeping input current IB as a 
parameter. 
• Active Region:  
      In this region JEB is forward biased and JCB is 
reverse biased. Output characteristics in the active 
region are not horizontal lines because for a fixed 
value of IB the magnitude of collector current 
increases with VCE due to early effect.

Since the leakage current ICEO is very small IC ≈ βIB

called as cut off region. In this region IC= ICEO (Collector to emitter leakage current with 
base open)

    Here both the junctions are forward biased by at least the cutin voltage. The current IC 
is independent of IB.

Field-Effect Transistors 
INTRODUCTION 
The field-effect transistor (FET) is a three-terminal device used for a variety of applications that 
match, to a large extent, those of the BJT transistor. JFET transistor is a voltage-controlled 
device. For the FET the current ID will be a function of the voltage VGS applied to the input 
circuit. The FET is a unipolar device depending solely on either electron (n- channel) or hole ( p 
-channel) conduction. 
      
 
The term field effect in the name deserves some explanation. We are all familiar 
with the ability of a permanent magnet to draw metal filings to itself without the need for actual 
contact. The magnetic field of the permanent magnet envelopes the filings and attracts them to the 
magnet along the shortest path provided by the magnetic flux lines. For the FET an electric field 
is established by the charges present, which controls the conduction path of the output circuit 
without the need for direct contact between the controlling and controlled quantities. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
FIG. 1 
voltage-controlled amplifiers. 
 
 
Comparison of  some of the general characteristics of BJT with  FET: 
 
One of the most important characteristics of the FET is its high input impedance. 
The variation in output current is typically a great deal more for BJTs than for FETs for the same 
change in the applied voltage. 
FETs are more temperature stable than BJTs, and FETs are usually smaller than BJTs, making 
them particularly useful in integrated-circuit (IC) chips. 
The construction characteristics of some FETs, however, can make them more sensitive to 
handling than BJTs. 
 
Type of FET: 
Three types of FETs : the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), the metal–oxide–
semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), and the metal– semiconductor field-effect 
transistor (MESFET). The MOSFET category is further broken down into depletion and 
enhancement types. The MOSFET transistor has become one of the most important devices 
used in the design and construction of integrated circuits for digital computers. Its thermal 
stability and other general characteristics make it extremely popular in computer circuit design. 
 
 

CONSTRUCTION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF JFETs 
 
JFET is a three-terminal device with one terminal capable of controlling the current between 
the other two. The major part of the structure is the n-type material, which forms the channel 
between the embedded layers of p-type material. In the absence of any applied potentials the 
JFET has two p–n junctions under no-bias conditions. The result is a depletion region at each 
junction, as shown in Fig. 2 that resembles the same region of a diode under no-bias conditions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
FIG. 2 
Junction field-effect transistor (JFET). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VG = 0 V, VDS Some Positive Value 
 
A positive voltage VDS is applied across the channel and the gate is connected directly to the 
source to establish the condition VGS =0 V .Under the conditions the flow of charge is relatively 
uninhibited and is limited solely by the resistance of the n-channel between drain and source. 
The depletion region is wider near the top of both type materials. The current ID will establish 
the voltage levels through the channel as indicated on the figure. The result is that the upper 
region of the p-type material will be reverse-biased by about. 
 
As the voltage VDS is increased from 0 V to a few volts, the current will increase as 
determined by Ohm’s law and the plot of ID versus VDS.As VDS increases and approaches a 
level referred to as VP , the depletion regions will widen, causing a noticeable reduction in the 
channel width. The reduced path of conduction causes the resistance to increase. The more 
horizontal the curve, the higher the resistance, suggesting that the resistance is approaching 
“infinite” ohms in the horizontal region. If VDS is increased to a level where it appears that the 
two depletion regions would touch” , a condition referred to as pinch-off will result.  
 
 
 
 
 

                 
                               FIG 3  JFET at VGS = 0 V and VDS 7 0 V         FIG 4  ID versus VDS for VGS = 0 V.                               
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As VDS is increased beyond VP, the region of close encounter between the two depletion regions 
increases in length long the channel, but the level of ID remains essentially the same. In essence, 
therefore, once VDS  7 VP the JFET has the characteristics of a current source. As shown in Fig. 
5, the current is fixed at ID  =  IDSS, but the voltage VDS (for levels 7 VP) is determined by the 
applied load. 
The choice of notation IDSS is derived from the fact that it is the drain-to-source current with a 
short circuit connection from gate to source.IDSS is the maximum drain current for a JFET and is 
defined by the conditions VGS =0 V and 
 VDS>| VP |. 
VGS < 0 V 
The voltage from gate to source, denoted VGS, is the controlling voltage of the JFET. Curves of 
ID versus VDS for various levels of VGS can be developed for the JFET. For the n-channel 
device the controlling voltage VGS is made more and more negative from its VGS= 0 V level. 
The effect of the applied negative-bias VGS is to establish depletion regions similar to those 
obtained with VGS     0 V, but at lower levels of VDS. Therefore, the result of applying a 
negative bias to the gate is to reach the saturation level at a lower level of VDS, as shown in Fig. 
6 for VGS  =  - 1 V. The resulting saturation level for ID has been reduced and in fact will 
continue to decrease as VGS is made more and more negative. Eventually, VGS when VGS  =  - 
VP will be sufficiently negative to establish a saturation level that is essentially 0 mA, and for all 
practical purposes the device has been “turned off.” In summary: 
The level of VGS that results in ID= 0 mA is defined by VGS =VP, with VP being a negative 
voltage for n-channel devices and a positive voltage for p-channel JFETs.

TRANSFER CHARACTERISTICS                                             
Derivation 
For the BJT transistor the output 
current  and the input controlling 
current   are 
related by beta, which was considered constant for the analysis to be performed. In equation 
form 
                                                IC  =  f (IB) =  βIB      -(1)      
 The squared term in the equation results in a nonlinear relationship between ID and VGS, 
producing a curve that grows exponentially with decreasing magnitude of VGS. 
                                            
    
                          
                                                                          
-(2)                                                                                  
      
The squared term in the equation results in a nonlinear relationship between ID and VGS, 
producing a curve that grows exponentially with decreasing magnitude of VGS. 
The transfer characteristics defined by Shockley’s equation are unaffected by the network in 
which the device is employed

DEPLETION-TYPE MOSFET   
 
       MOSFETs are further broken down into depletion type and 
enhancement type. The terms depletion and enhancement define 
their basic mode of operation; the name MOSFET stands for 
metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor 
 
Basic Construction: 
The basic construction of the n-channel depletion-type MOSFET 
is provided in Fig. A slab of p-type material is formed from a 
silicon base and is referred to as the substrate. It is the foundation 
on which the device is constructed. In some cases the substrate is 
internally connected to the source terminal. The gate is also 
connected to a metal contact surface but remains insulated from 
the n-channel by a very thin silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer. SiO2 is 
a type of insulator referred to as a dielectric, which sets up 
opposing (as indicated by the prefix di-) electric fields within the 
dielectric when exposed to an externally applied field.

Basic Operation: 
The gate-to-source voltage is set to 0 V by the direct connection from one terminal to the 
other, and a voltage VDD is applied across the drain-to-source terminals. The result is an attraction 
of the free electrons of the n-channel for the positive voltage at the drain. The result is a current 
similar to that flowing in the channel of the JFET. In fact, the resulting current with VGS     0 V 
continues to be labeled IDSS. 
VGS is set at a negative voltage such as -1 V. The negative potential at the gate will tend to pressure 
electrons toward the p-type substrate (like charges repel) and attract holes from the p-type substrate 
(opposite charges attract). 
 
Depending on the magnitude of the negative bias established by VGS, a level of recombination 
between electrons and holes will occur that will reduce the number of free electrons in the n-channel 
available for conduction. The more negative the bias, the higher is the rate of recombination. The 
resulting level of drain current is therefore reduced with increasing negative bias for VGS. 
 
 
 
ENHANCEMENT-TYPE MOSFET  
 
The characteristics of the enhancement-type MOSFET are quite different from depletion type 
MOSFET. 
 
Basic Construction: 
A slab of p-type material is formed from a silicon 
base and is again referred to as the substrate. As with 
the 
depletion-type 
MOSFET, 
the 
substrate 
is 
sometimes internally connected to the source terminal, 
whereas in other cases a fourth lead (labeled SS) is 
made available for external control of its potential 
level. The source and drain terminals are again 
connected through metallic contacts to n-doped 
regions, but note in Fig.  the absence of a channel 
between the two n-doped regions. This is the primary 
difference between the construction of depletion-type 
and enhancement-type MOSFETs—the absence of a 
channel as a constructed component of the device. In 
summary, 
therefore, 
the 
construction 
of 
an 
enhancement-type MOSFET is quite similar to that of 
the depletion-type MOSFET, except for the absence of 
a channel between the drain and source terminals. 
 
 
Basic Operation: 
If VGS is set at 0 V and a voltage applied between the drain and 
the source of the device of Fig, the absence of an n-channel (with its generous number of free 
carriers) will result in a current of effectively 0 A—quite different from the depletion-type 
MOSFET and JFET, where ID  =  IDSS. It is not sufficient to have a large accumulation of 
carriers (electrons) at the drain and the source (due to the n-doped regions) if a path fails to exist 
between the two. With VDS some positive voltage, VGS at 0 V, and terminal SS directly 
connected to the source, there are in fact two reverse-biased p–n junctions between the n-doped 
regions and the p-substrate to oppose any significant flow between drain and source. 
The level of VGS that results in the significant increase in drain 
current is called the threshold voltage and is given the symbol VT. On specification sheets it is 
referred to as VGS(Th), although VT is less unwieldy and will be used in the analysis to follow. 
Since the channel is nonexistent with VGS     0 V and “enhanced” by the application of a 
positive gate-to-source voltage, this type of MOSFET is called an enhancement-type MOSFET. 
 

                                       
FET Biasing 
 
For the field-effect transistor, the relationship between input and output quantities is nonlinear due 
to the squared term in Shockley’s equation. Linear relationships result in straight lines when plotted 
on a graph of one variable versus the other, whereas nonlinear functions result in curves as obtained 
for the transfer characteristics of a JFET. The nonlinear relationship between ID and VGS can 
complicate the mathematical approach to the dc analysis of FET configurations. A graphical 
approach may limit solutions to tenths-place accuracy, but it is a quicker method for most FET 
amplifiers. Since the graphical approach is in general the most popular, the analysis of this chapter 
will have graphical solutions rather than mathematical solutions. 
 
FIXED-BIAS CONFIGURATION: 
The simplest of biasing arrangements for the n-channel JFET appears in Fig.1. Referred  to as the 
fixed-bias configuration,

The fact that the negative terminal of the battery is connected directly to the defined positive 
potential of VGS clearly reveals that the polarity of VGS is directly opposite to that of VGG. 
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law in the clockwise direction results in  
- VGG  - VGS  =  0 
VGS  =  - VGG        
Since VGG is a fixed dc supply, the voltage VGS is fixed in magnitude, resulting in the 
designation “fixed-bias configuration.” 
 The drain-to-source voltage of the output section can be determined by applying 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law as follows:          
                     VDS  =  VDD  - ID RD                                                                                                           

                              
 
              
=  VDS + =  VDS + 0 V,                                                                                                          
 
 
SELF-BIAS CONFIGURATION     
 
The self-bias configuration eliminates the need for 
two dc supplies. The controlling gate-to-source 
voltage is now determined by the voltage across a 
resistor RS introduced in the source leg of the 
configuration. 
 
For the dc analysis, the capacitors can again be 
replaced by “open circuits” and the resistor RG 
replaced by a short-circuit equivalent since  
IG  =  0 A.

VOLTAGE-DIVIDER BIASING                                                  
 
The basic construction is exactly the same, but the dc analysis of each is quite different. IG  =  
0 A for FET amplifiers, but the magnitude 
of IB for common-emitter BJT amplifiers 
can affect the dc levels of current and 
volt- age in both the input and output 
circuits. Recall that IB provides the link 
between input and output circuits for the 
BJT 
voltage-divider 
configuration, 
whereas VGS does the same for the FET 
configuration. 
 
Since IG  =  0 A, Kirchhoff’s current law 
requires that IR1   =  IR2, and the series 
equivalent circuit appearing to the left of 
the figure can be used to find the level of 
VG. The voltage VG, equal to the voltage 
across R2, can be found using the voltage-
divider rule as follows:

Feedback Amplifiers and Oscillators: 
 
• Feedback implies the transfer of energy from the output of a system to its input. If a 
portion or the whole of the output signal of an amplifier is fed back and superimposed on 
the input signal, the performance of the amplifier changes significantly. Then the 
amplifier is said to be a feedback amplifier. 
• Negative/Inverse/Degenerative Feedback:- Feedback signal diminishes the magnitude of 
the input signal. 
• Positive/Direct/Regenerative Feedback:- Feedback signal enhances the magnitude of the 
input signal. 
 
Negative/Inverse/Degenerative Feedback 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the above circuit the input signal to the amplifier with gain A is the difference of the input 
signal VS and feedback signal Vf . The feedback circuit can contain passive elements like 
resistors, inductors, capacitors and active elements like transistors. 
Transfer Gain of a feedback amplifier: 
VO=AVi     (A= VO/ Vi  is the gain without feedback or open loop gain) 
Vf = βVO    (β= Vf/VO is known as the feedback fraction, the feedback ratio, the reverse    
                    transfer  ratio or the reverse transmission factor) 
Vi=Vs- Vf   (Positive sign for positive feedback) 
Vs = Vi +Vf= VO/A+ βVO 
Af=VO/Vs=A/(1+Aβ)  is the gain with feedback called as closed loop gain. 
The quantity Aβ is called as loop gain, the feedback factor, the return ratio or the loop 
transmission. 
The feedback introduced into an amplifier is usually expressed in decibles(dB) by the 
relationship

For negative feedback F is negative and for positive feedback F is positive. 
Feedback amplifier topologies:

topologies.

Effect of 
Negative 
Feedback: 
A number of improvements are obtained in negative feedback 
1. Better stabilised voltage gain 
2. Higher input impedance and lower output impedance 
3. Improved frequency response 
4. Reduced noise  
5. More linear operation 
Positive/Direct/Regenerative Feedback: 
In positive feedback input signal to the amplifier with gain A is the additione of the input signal 
VS and feedback signal Vf . 
VO=AVi      

Vf = βVO     
Vi=Vs+Vf    
Vs = Vi -Vf= VO/A- βVO 
Af=VO/Vs=A/(1-Aβ)   
Oscillator Operation: 
 
 
 
 
 
     The use of positive feedback that results in a feedback amplifier having closed-loop gain Af 
greater than 1 satisfies the phase conditions will result in operation as an oscillator. 
When the switch at the amplifier input is open, no oscillation occurs. Considering fictitious 
voltage Vi at the amplifier input VO=AVi. And Vf=AβVi. 
      If the circuits of the base amplifier and the feedback network provide Aβ of a correct 
magnitude and phase, Vf can be made equal to Vi. Then, when the switch is closed and the 
fictitious voltage Vi is removed, the circuit will continue operating since the feedback voltage is 
sufficient to drive the amplifier, resulting in a proper input voltage to sustain the loop operation. 
The output waveform will still exist after the switch is closed if the condition Aβ=1 is met. This 
is known as Barkhausen criterion for oscillation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Operational Amplifier 
The Operational Amplifier is a direct-coupled , high gain , negative feedback amplifier. It is 
nothing more than a differential amplifier which amplifies the difference between two inputs.  
 
General circuit diagram of an op-amp 
The terminal marked - is called the inverting terminal which means signal applied there will 
appear phase inverted at the output while the terminal marked + is called the non inverting 
terminal means that the signal applied here will appear in phase and applied at the output . Please 
understand that the - and + do not denote any type of voltage it means that output voltage is 
proportional to the difference of Non Inverting and inverting voltages which is Vo = V2 - V1 . 
When there is no feedback , no voltage or  capacitor between output and input the op-amp is said 
to be in open loop condition . 
Characteristics of an ideal op-amp 
An Ideal Op-Amp has the following characteristics. 
* An infinite voltage gain 
* An infinite bandwidth 
* An infinite input resistance: The resistance b/w V1 and V2 terminals is infinite . 
* Zero output resistance: Vo remains constant no matter what resistance is applied across output . 
* Perfect balance: When V1 is equal to V2 the Vo is 0 . 
Single-Ended Input 
Single-ended input operation results when the input signal is connected to one inputwith the 
other input connected to ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIG.2.Single ended input 

Double-Ended Output 
       While the operation discussed so far had a single output, the op-amp can also be operated 
with opposite outputs, as shown in Fig. 1. An input applied to either input will result in outputs 
from both output terminals, these outputs always being opposite in polarity. Figure 3 shows a 
single-ended input with a double-ended output. As shown, the signal applied to the plus input 
results in two amplified outputs of opposite polarity. Figure 4 shows the same operation with a 
single output measured. 
 
FIG.3Double-ended output 
 
 
FIG.4Double-ended output with single-ended input 
 
Common-Mode Operation 
When the same input signals are applied to both inputs, common-mode operation results, the two 
inputs are equally amplified, and since they result in opposite polarity signals at the output, these 
signals cancel, resulting in0-V output. Practically, a small output signal will result 
 
 
FIG.5Common-modeoperation 
Common-Mode Rejection 
 
        A significant feature of a differential connection is that the signals which are opposite at the 
inputs are highly amplified, while those which are common to the two inputs are only slightly 
amplified—the overall operation being to amplify the difference signal while rejecting the 
common signal at the two inputs. 

 
DIFFERENTIAL AND COMMONMODEOPERATION 
 
     One of the more important features of a differential circuit connection, as provided in an op-
amp, is the circuit’s ability to greatly amplify signals that are opposite at the two inputs, while 
only slightly amplifying signals that are common to both inputs. An op-amp provides an output 
component that is due to the amplification of the difference of the signals applied to the plus and 
minus inputs and a component due to the signals common to both inputs. Since amplification of 
the opposite input signals is much greater than that of the common input signals, the circuit 
provides a common mode rejection as described by a numerical value called the common-mode 
rejection ratio (CMRR). 
Differential Inputs 
 
When separate inputs are applied to the op-amp, the resulting difference signal is the difference 
between the two inputs. 
 
Common Inputs 
When both input signals are the same, a common signal element due to the two inputscan be 
defined as the average of the sum of the two signals. 
 
 
Output Voltage 
Since any signals applied to an op-amp in general have both in-phase and out-of phase 
components, the resulting output can be expressed as 
 
Where Vd = difference voltage given by Eq.  
Vc = common voltage given by Eq.  
Ad =differential gain of the amplifier 
Ac = common-mode gain of the amplifier 
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio 
Having obtained Ad and Ac (as in the measurement procedure discussed above), wecan now 
calculate a value for the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), which isdefined by the 
following equation: 
 

The value of CMRR can also be expressed in logarithmic terms as 
 
We can express the output voltage in terms of the value of CMRR as follows: 
 
 
Basic of Op-Amp 
 The circuit shown provides operation as a constant-gain multiplier. An input signal, V1, is 
applied through resistor R1 to the minus input. The output is then connected back to the same 
minus input through resistor Rf. The plus input is connected to ground. Since the signal V1 is 
essentially applied to the minus input, the resulting output is opposite in phase to the input signal. 
Figure 6a shows the op-amp replaced by its ac equivalent 
circuit. If we use the ideal op-amp equivalent circuit, replacing Ri by an infinite resistance and 
Ro by zero resistance, the ac equivalent circuit is that shown in Fig.6b. The circuit is then 
redrawn, as shown in Fig. 6c, from which circuit analysis is carried out.

PRACTICAL OP-AMP CIRCUITS 
Inverting Amplifier 
The most widely used constant-gain amplifier circuit is the 
inverting amplifier, as shown. The output is obtained by 
multiplying the input by a fixed or constant gain, set by the 
input resistor (R1) and feedback resistor (Rf)—this output 
also being inverted from the input. Using Eq. (14.8) we can 
write 
 
Noninverting Amplifier 
The connection of Fig. 8shows an op-amp circuit that works as a noninverting amplifier or 
constant-gain multiplier. It should be noted that the inverting amplifier connection is more 
widely used because it has better frequency stability (discussed later). To determine the voltage 
gain of the circuit, we can use the equivalent representation shown in Fig. 14.16b. Note that the 
voltage across R1 is V1 since Vi =0 V. This must be equal to the output voltage, through a 
voltage divider of R1 and Rf, so that 
 
FIG.8.Noninverting constant-gain multiplier 
 

Summing amplifier 
The circuit shows a three-input summing amplifier circuit, which provides a means of 
algebraically summing (adding) three voltages, each multiplied by a constant-gain factor. Using 
the equivalent representation shown in Fig. 9, the output voltage can be expressed in terms of the 
inputs as 
 
In other words, each input adds a voltage to the output multiplied by its separate constant-gain 
multiplier. If more inputs are used, they each add an additional component to the output.

Subtractor: 
 
FIG.10 Substractor 

The aim of the subtractor is to provide an output which is equal to the difference of the two input 
signals or proportional to their difference. For minimum offset error R1 || R2 = R3 || R4 . 
Op-Amp as Integrator 
 
The operational amplifier integrator is an electronic integration circuit. Based around the 
operational amplifier (op-amp), it performs the mathematical operation of integration with 
respect to time; that is, its output voltage is proportional to the input voltage integrated over time. 
The input current is offset by a negative feedback current flowing in the capacitor, which is 
generated by an increase in output voltage of the amplifier. The output voltage is therefore 
dependent on the value of input current it has to offset and the inverse of the value of the 
feedback capacitor. The greater the capacitor value, the less output voltage has to be generated to 
produce a particular feedback current flow. 
Ideal circuit 
 
        The circuit operates by passing a current that charges or discharges the capacitor Cf during 
the time under consideration, which strives to retain the virtual ground condition at the input by 
off-setting the effect of the input current. Referring to the above diagram, if the op-amp is 
assumed to be ideal, nodes v1 and v2 are held equal, and so v2 is a virtual ground. The input 
voltage passes a current vin/R1.through the resistor producing a compensating current flow 
through the series capacitor to maintain the virtual ground. This charges or discharges the 
capacitor over time. Because the resistor and capacitor are connected to a virtual ground, the 
input current does not vary with capacitor charge and a linear integration of output is achieved. 
The circuit can be analyzed by applying Kirchhoff's current law at the node v2, keeping ideal op-
amp behavior in mind. 

 
 in an ideal op-amp, so: 
 
Furthermore, the capacitor has a voltage-current relationship governed by the 
equation: 
 
Substituting the appropriate variables: 
 
in an ideal op-amp, resulting in: 
 
Integrating both sides with respect to time: 
 
If the initial value of vo is assumed to be 0 V, this results in a DC error of: 
 
The Op-amp Differentiator Amplifier 
The basic Op-amp Differentiator circuit is the exact opposite to that of the Integrator Amplifier 
circuit that we looked at in the previous tutorial. Here, the position of the capacitor and resistor 
have been reversed and now the reactance, Xc is connected to the input terminal of the inverting 
amplifier while the resistor, Rƒ forms the negative feedback element across the operational 
amplifier as normal. 

This Operational Amplifier circuit performs the mathematical operation of Differentiation that 
is it “produces a voltage output which is directly proportional to the input voltage’s rate-of-
change with respect to time“. In other words the faster or larger the change to the input voltage 
signal, the greater the input current, the greater will be the output voltage change in response, 
becoming more of a “spike” in shape. 
As with the integrator circuit, we have a resistor and capacitor forming an RC Network across 
the operational amplifier and the reactance ( Xc ) of the capacitor plays a major role in the 
performance of a Op-amp Differentiator. 
Op-amp Differentiator Circuit 
 
  
The input signal to the differentiator is applied to the capacitor. The capacitor blocks any DC 
content so there is no current flow to the amplifier summing point, X resulting in zero output 
voltage. The capacitor only allows AC type input voltage changes to pass through and whose 
frequency is dependent on the rate of change of the input signal. 
At low frequencies the reactance of the capacitor is “High” resulting in a low gain ( Rƒ/Xc ) and 
low output voltage from the op-amp. At higher frequencies the reactance of the capacitor is much 
lower resulting in a higher gain and higher output voltage from the differentiator amplifier. 
However, at high frequencies an op-amp differentiator circuit becomes unstable and will start to 
oscillate. This is due mainly to the first-order effect, which determines the frequency response of 
the op-amp circuit causing a second-order response which, at high frequencies gives an output 
voltage far higher than what would be expected. To avoid this high frequency gain of the circuit 
needs to be reduced by adding an additional small value capacitor across the feedback resistor 
Rƒ. 
 

 The charge on the capacitor equals Capacitance x Voltage across the capacitor 
 
 The rate of change of this charge is 
 
 but dQ/dt is the capacitor current i 
 
  
from which we have an ideal voltage output for the op-amp differentiator is given as: 
 
Therefore, the output voltage Vout is a constant -Rƒ.C times the derivative of the input voltage 
Vin with respect to time. The minus sign indicates a 180o phase shift because the input signal is 
connected to the inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

MODULE-3 
Number System 
 The decimal number system (Base 10) is a familiar number system.  Some other number 
systems that are having equal importance are: Binary (Base 2),octal(Base 8), Hexadecimal(Base 
16) 
All number systems have some common characteristics: 
• The digits are consecutive. 
• The number of digits is equal to the size of the base. 
• Zero is always the first digit. 
• The base number is never a digit. 
• When 1 is added to the largest digit, a sum of zero and a carry of one results. 
• Numeric values determined by the have implicit positional values of the digits. 
 
Binary Numbers 
The binary number system is used to model the series of electrical signals computers use to 
represent information. It is also called the “Base 2 system”. 
 
Each digit in binary is a 0 or a 1 and is called a bit, which is an abbreviation of binary digit. 0 
represents the no voltage or an off state  and 1 represents the presence of voltage or an on 
state  
 
There are several common conventions for representation of numbers in binary.The most 
familiar is unsigned binary. An example of a 8-bit number in this case is 
010011112 = 0*27 + 1*26 +_ _ _+ 1*20 = 64 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 7910 
 
The largest number which can be represented by n bits is 2n − 1. For example, with 4                   
bits the largest number is 11112 = 15. 
 
The most significant bit (MSB) is the bit representing the highest power of 2, and the 
Least significant bit (LSB) represents the lowest power of 2. 
 
Example :              Binary: 1110110111

Decimal to Binary Conversion 
The easiest way to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent is to use the 
repeated division of  a decimal number by 2 and records the quotient and remainder. 
 
The remainder digits (a sequence of zeros and ones) form the binary equivalent in 
least significant to most significant digit sequence 
    
  Example: Convert 67 to its binary equivalent: 
   6710 = x2 
    Step 1: 67 / 2 = 33 R 1         Divide 67 by 2.  Record quotient in next row 
    Step 2: 33 / 2 = 16 R 1       Again divide by 2; record quotient in next row 
    Step 3: 16 / 2 = 8 R 0 
            Repeat again 
    Step 4: 8 / 2 = 4 R 0 
 
  Repeat again 
    Step 5: 4 / 2 = 2 R 0 
 
        Repeat again 
    Step 6: 2 / 2 = 1 R 0 
 
             Repeat again 

    Step 7: 1 / 2 = 0 R 1 
 
 
STOP when quotient equals 0 
 
Thus (67)10= (1 0 0 0 0 1 1)2 
 
 
Similarly we can convert 57 and 211 as given below 
 
 53  
= 32 + 16 + 4 + 1 
 
= 25 + 24 + 22 + 20 
 
= 1*25 + 1*24 + 0*23 + 1*22 + 0*21 + 1*20 
 
= 110101 in binary 
 
= 00110101 as a full byte in binary 
 
 211= 128 + 64 + 16 + 2 + 1 
 
= 27 + 26 + 24 + 21 + 20 
 
= 1*27 + 1*26 + 0*25 + 1*24 + 0*23 + 0*22 + 
 
   1*21 + 1*20 
 
= 11010011 in binary 
 
Binary to Decimal Conversion 
 
Multiply the binary digits by increasing powers of two, starting from the right and then find 
the decimal number equivalent by summing those products. 
 
Example:  
 
 What is 10011010 in decimal? 
10011010     = 1*27 + 0*26 + 0*25 + 1*24 + 1*23 +  
 
 
         
       0*22 + 1*21 + 0*20 
 
 
 
    = 27 + 24 + 23 + 21 
 
 
 
    = 128 + 16 + 8 + 2 
 
 
 
    = 154 
 
 What is 00101001 in decimal? 
 00101001   = 0*27 + 0*26 + 1*25 + 0*24 + 1*23 +  
 
 
 
       0*22 + 0*21 + 1*20 
 
 
 
    = 25 + 23 + 20 
 
 
 
    = 32 + 8 + 1 
 
 
 
    = 41 
Representation of Negative Numbers 
 
There are two commonly used conventions for representing negative numbers. With sign 
magnitude, the MSB is used to flag a negative number. So for example with 4-bit numbers we 
would have 0011 = 3 and 1011 = −3. This is simple to see, but is not good for doing arithmetic. 

 
With 2's complement, negative numbers are designed so that the sum of a number and its 2's 
complement is zero. 
  
Using the 4-bit example , we have 0101 = 5 and its 2's complement −5 = 1011. Adding 
(remember to carry) gives 10000 = 0. (The 5th bit doesn't count!) 
 Both addition and multiplication work as you would expect using 2's complement. 
There are two methods for forming the 2's complement: 
1. Make the transformation 0 ! 1 and 1!0, then add 1. 
2. Add some number to −2MSB to get the number you want. For 4-bit numbers an 
example of finding the 2's complement of 5 is −5 = −8 + 3 = 1000 + 0011 = 1011.

 Octal Number System 
 
Also known as the Base 8 System. Uses digits 0 – 7.It can be readily converts to binary  by 
grouping  three (binary) digits starting from the radix point. Each octal number converts to 3 
binary digits 
Example: 
1) Convert 42710 to its octal equivalent: 
 
 
427 / 8 = 53 R3 
 
Divide by 8; R is LSD 
 
53 / 8 = 6 R5  
Divide Q by 8; R is next digit 
 
6 / 8 = 0 R6 
 
Repeat until Q = 0 
Thus 42710= 6538 
 
2) Convert 6538 to binary

Thus  6538= 1101010112 
 
Hexadecimal Representation 

It is very often quite useful to represent blocks of 4 bits by a single digit. Thus in base 16 there is 
a convention for using one digit for the numbers 0,1,2,: : :,15 which is called hexadecimal. It 
follows decimal for 0 to 9, then uses letters A to F for representing 10 to 15 respectively. 
 
 
CONVERSIONS 
• Convert  83010 to its hexadecimal equivalent: 
 
 
830 / 16 = 51 R14 
 
 
51 / 16 = 3 R3 
 
 
3 / 16 = 0 R3 
             Thus 83010 = 33E( As 14 is represented as E) 
 
Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion 
 
The easiest method for converting binary to hexadecimal is to use a substitution code.Each 
hex number converts to 4 binary digits as shown in the table.

Logic Gates 
A logic gate is a hardware implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical 
operation on one or more logical inputs, and produces a single logical output. Depending on the 
context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has for instance zero rise time and 
unlimited fan-out( the number of gate inputs it can feed or connect to), or it may refer to a non-
ideal physical device 
Logic gates are primarily implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic witches, 
but 
can 
also 
be 
constructed 
using vacuum 
tubes, 
electromagnetic 
relays , fluidic  
ogic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements. With amplification, logic 
gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the 
construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms 
and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic.

more one or more of its inputs are true. A plus (+) is used to show the OR operation. 
 
NOT gate 
• The NOT gate is an electronic circuit  that produces an inverted version of the input at its 
output.  
• It is also known as an inverter.  
• If the input variable is A, the inverted output is known as NOT A.  

• This is also shown as A', or Ā with a bar over the top. 
 
NAND gate 
• This  is  a NOT-AND gate which is equal to an AND followed by a NOT gate. 
• The outputs of all NAND gates are true if any of the inputs are false.  
• The symbol is an AND gate with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents 
inversion. 
 
NOR gate 
• This  is  a NOT-OR gate which is equal to an OR gate followed by a  gate followed by a NOT 
gate  . 
• The outputs of all NOR gates are false if  any of the inputs are true.  
• The symbol is an OR gate with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents

EXOR gate  
• The 'Exclusive-OR' gate is a circuit which will  give a true output if either, but not both, of its 
two inputs are true.  
• An encircled plus sign (⊕) is used to show the EXOR operation.  
 
EXNOR gate 
• The 'Exclusive-NOR' gate circuit does the opposite to the EXNOR gate. 
• It will give a false output if either, but not both, of its two inputs are true.

n Once the Boolean expression for a given logic circuit has been determined, a truth table 
that shows the output for all possible values of the input variables can be developed. 
n Let’s take the example: 
 
 
 
A(B+CD)  
n There are four variables, hence 16 (24) combinations of values are possible.  
n To evaluate the expression A(B+CD), first   
 find the values of the variables that make 
 the expression equal to 1 (using the rules for 
 Boolean add & mult). 
n In this case, the expression equals 1 
 only if A=1 and B+CD=1 because 
 
 
 
A(B+CD) = 1·1 = 1  
n Now, determine when B+CD term equals 1. 
n The term B+CD=1 if either B=1 or CD=1 
 or if both B and CD equal 1 because 
 
 
 
B+CD = 1+0 = 1 
 
 
 
B+CD = 0+1 = 1 
 
 
 
B+CD = 1+1 = 1  
n The term CD=1 only if C=1 and D=1

• 
Present output not only depends on present inputs but also on the previous state of output. 
• 
It can be realized as combinational circuit with a feedback path along with a memory element. 
 
The most basic memory element can be realized by two inverters forming a static 
memory cell.  Assume A=0 and B=1, then the below circuit will maintain these values 
indefinitely (as long as it has power applied) . The state is defined by the value of the 
memory cell

S-R Latches : 
• Most basic type of latch. 
• It is known as set-reset latch as it has two stable output state. 
• 
 NOR gates can be used instead of inverters. The SR latch below has two inputs S and R, 
which will control the outputs Q and Q’. 
• 
Here Q and Q’ feed back into the circuit. They’re not only outputs, they’re also inputs! 
• 
To figure out how Q and Q’ change, we have to look at not only the inputs S and R, but 
also the current values of Q and Q’: 
Qnext = (R + Q’current)’ 
Q’next = (S + Qcurrent)’

Gated SR latch 
 
A gated SR latch circuit diagram constructed from NOR gates. 
A synchronous SR latch (sometimes clocked SR flip-flop) can be made by adding a second level 
of NAND gates to the inverted SR latch (or a second level of AND gates to the direct SR latch). 
The extra NAND gates further invert the inputs so the simple SR latch becomes a gated SR latch 
(and a simple SR latch would transform into a gated SR latch with inverted enable). 
With E high (enable true), the signals can pass through the input gates to the encapsulated 
latch; all signal combinations except for (0,0) = hold then immediately reproduce on the (Q,Q) 
output, i.e. the latch istransparent. 
With E low (enable false) the latch is closed (opaque) and remains in the state it was left the last 
time E was high. 
The enable input is sometimes a clock signal, but more often a read or write strobe. 

Gated D latch 
 
A D-type transparent latch based on an SR NAND latch 
 
A gated D latch based on an SR NOR latch 
This latch exploits the fact that, in the two active input combinations (01 and 10) of a gated SR 
latch, R is the complement of S. The input NAND stage converts the two D input states (0 and 1) 
to these two input combinations for the next SR latch by inverting the data input signal. The low 
state of the enable signal produces the inactive "11" combination. Thus a gated D-latch may be 
considered as a one-input synchronous SR latch. This configuration prevents application of the 
restricted input combination. It is also known as transparent latch,data latch, or simply gated 
latch. It has a data input and an enable signal (sometimes named clock, or control). The 
word transparent comes from the fact that, when the enable input is on, the signal propagates 
directly through the circuit, from the input D to the output Q. 
Transparent latches are typically used as I/O ports or in asynchronous systems, or in 
synchronous two-phase systems (synchronous systems that use a two-phase clock), where two 
latches operating on different clock phases prevent data transparency as in a master–slave flip-
flop. 
Latches are available as integrated circuits, usually with multiple latches per chip. For example, 
74HC75 is a quadruple transparent latch in the 7400 series.

Symbol for a gated D latch
The truth table shows that when the enable/clock input is 0, the D input has no effect on the 
output. When E/C is high, the output equals D. 
 
J-K Flip-flop 
This simple JK flip Flop is the most widely used of all the flip-flop designs and is considered to 
be a universal flip-flop circuit. The sequential operation of the JK flip flop is exactly the same as 
for the previous SR flip-flop with the same “Set” and “Reset” inputs. The difference this time is 
that the “JK flip flop” has no invalid or forbidden input states of the SR Latch even 
when S and R are both at logic “1”. 
The JK flip flop is basically a gated SR Flip-flop with the addition of a clock input circuitry that 
prevents the illegal or invalid output condition that can occur when both inputs S and R are 
equal to logic level “1”. Due to this additional clocked input, a JK flip-flop has four possible input 
combinations, “logic 1″, “logic 0″, “no change” and “toggle”. The symbol for a JK flip flop is 
similar to that of an SR Bistable Latch as seen in the previous tutorial except for the addition of 
a clock input. 

 
Both the S and the R inputs of the previous SR bistable have now been replaced by two inputs 
called the J and K inputs, respectively after its inventor Jack Kilby. Then this equates 
to: J = S and K = R. 
The two 2-input AND gates of the gated SR bistable have now been replaced by two 3-
input NANDgates with the third input of each gate connected to the outputs at Q and Q. This 
cross coupling of the SR flip-flop allows the previously invalid condition of S = “1” and R = “1” 
state to be used to produce a “toggle action” as the two inputs are now interlocked. 
If the circuit is now “SET” the J input is inhibited by the “0” status of Q through the 
lower NAND gate. If the circuit is “RESET” the K input is inhibited by the “0” status of Q through 
the upper NAND gate. As Qand Q are always different we can use them to control the input. 
When both inputs J and K are equal to logic “1”, the JK flip flop toggles as shown in the 
following truth table.

Shift registers 
 
Shift registers are a type of sequential logic circuit, mainly for storage of digital data. They are a 
group of flip-flops connected in a chain so that the output from one flip-flop becomes the input 
of the next flip-flop. Most of the registers possess no characteristic internal sequence of states. 
All flip-flop is driven by a common clock, and all are set or reset simultaneously. 
 
Register: 
n A set of n flip-flops 
n Each flip-flop stores one bit 
n Two basic functions: data storage (Fig 1.2) and data movement (Fig 1.1). 
Shift Register: 
 A register that allows each of the flip-flops to pass the stored  information to its adjacent 
neighbour.  Fig 1.1  shows the basic data movement in shift registers. 
Counter: 
 A register that goes through a predetermined sequence of states 
 
Figure 1.1: Basic data movement in shift registers [Floyd]  
 
Fig 1.2: The flip-flop as a storage element 
 

 
Storage Capacity: 
The storage capacity of a register is the total number of bits (1 or 0) of digital data it can retain. 
Each stage (flip flop) in a shift register represents one bit of storage capacity.  Therefore the 
number of stages in a register determines its storage capacity. 
Classification  
 The shift registers can be classified as 
• Serial In - Serial Out(SISO) Shift Registers 
• Serial In - Parallel Out (SIPO)Shift Registers 
• Parallel In - Serial Out (PISO)Shift Registers 
• Parallel In - Parallel Out (PIPO)Shift Registers 
Serial In - Serial Out Shift Registers 
The serial in/serial out shift register accepts data serially – that is, one bit at a time on a single 
line. It produces the stored information on its output also in serial form. 
Basic four-bit shift register 
A basic four-bit shift register can be constructed using four D flip-flops, as shown in Fig 2.1. 
The operation of the circuit is as follows. 
• The register is first cleared, forcing all four outputs to zero. 
• The input data is then applied sequentially to the D input of the first flip-flop on the left 
(FF0). 
•  During each clock pulse, one bit is transmitted from left to right. 
•  Assume a data word to be 1001. 
•  The least significant bit of the data has to be shifted through the register from FF0 to 
FF3. 
 
 
Fig 2.1: Basic four-bit shift register 
 
In order to get the data out of the register, they must be shifted out serially. The data is loaded 
to the register when the control line is HIGH (ie WRITE). The data can be shifted out of the 
register when the control line is LOW (ie READ). 

Fig. 2.2 illustrates entry of the four bits 1010 into the register. Fig.2.3 shows the four bits (1010) 
being serially shifted out of the register and replaced by all zeros. 
 
Figure 2.2: Four bits (1010) being entered serially into the register. 
 

 
Figure 2.3: Four bits (1010) being serially shifted out of the register and replaced 
by all zeros 
Serial In - Parallel Out Shift Registers 
 
For this kind of register, data bits are entered serially in the same manner as discussed in the 
last section. The difference is the way in which the data bits are taken out of the register. Once 
the data are stored, each bit appears on its respective output line, and all bits are available 
simultaneously. A construction of a four-bit serial in - parallel out register is shown 
below(Fig.2.4). 
 
 
Fig.2.4:  A four-bit serial in - parallel out register 
 
Parallel In - Serial Out Shift Registers 
A four-bit parallel in - serial out shift register is shown below. The circuit uses D flip-flops and 
NAND gates for entering data (ie writing) to the register. 
 
 
Fig.2.4:  A four-bit serial in - parallel out register 
 
D0, D1, D2 and D3 are the parallel inputs, where D0 is the most significant bit and D3 is the 
least significant bit. To write data in, the mode control line is taken to LOW and the data is 
clocked in. The data can be shifted when the mode control line is HIGH as SHIFT is active high. 
 
Parallel In - Parallel Out Shift Registers 

For parallel in - parallel out shift registers, all data bits appear on the parallel outputs 
immediately following the simultaneous entry of the data bits. The following circuit is a four-bit 
parallel in - parallel out shift register constructed by D flip-flops. 
 
 
 
Fig.2. 5: parallel in - parallel out shift registers 
The D's are the parallel inputs and the Q's are the parallel outputs. Once the register is clocked, 
all the data at the D inputs appear at the corresponding Q outputs simultaneously. 
 
Bidirectional Shift Registers 
The registers discussed so far involved only right shift operations. Each right shift operation has 
the effect of successively dividing the binary number by two. If the operation is reversed (left 
shift), this has the effect of multiplying the number by two. With suitable gating arrangement a 
serial shift register can perform both operations. 
A bidirectional, or reversible, shift register is one in which the data can be shift either left or 
right. A four-bit bidirectional shift register using D flip-flops is shown below.

CATHORE RAY OSCILLOSCOPE: 
Cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is a versatile instrument used to visually 
observe wave shapes and to take measurements on them applied to the input 
terminals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic principle 
• Electron Gun:  It generates the beam which moves down the tube and strikes 
the screen. The screen glows at the point of collision, producing a bright 
spot. Electric or magnetic fields are used to deflect and move the spot to 
trace out a patter. 
• Y plates (Vertical deflection plates): These are used to deflect the beam 
vertically. 
• X plates (Horizontal deflection plates): These are used to deflect the beam 
horizontally. 
• When voltage is applied to the vertical and horizontal plates simultaneously 
the deflection of the beam is proportional to the resultant of the two voltages 

and the position of the beam is in between the vertical and horizontal axis of 
the screen. 
• For ac signal display the signal voltage is applied to the vertical plates and it 
moves the spot vertically to positions, corresponding to the instantaneous 
values of the signal. Simultaneously the spot is moved horizontally by a 
sweep voltage applied to the horizontal plates. The sweep must be linear and 
must move in one direction. 
 
Signal Generators: 
• A standard signal generator produces known and controllable 
voltages. It is used as a power source for measurement of gain, signal-
to-noise ratio, bandwidth, SWR and other properties. 
•  
•  
•  
•  
• RF oscillator generates the carrier frequency using LC tank circuit 
with constant output over any frequency range. 
• Modulation is done with the wideband amplifier which delivers the 
output to an attenuator. The output voltage is read by an output meter. 
• Modulation oscillator gives the frequency that has to be modulated by 
the carrier frequency. 
Principles of Communication: 
Modulation is the process by which some characteristics of a high frequency wave 
called the carrier, is changed according to the instantaneous value of a low 

frequency wave called the modulating wave. The resultant wave is called the 
modulated wave. 
Amplitude Modulation: 
Amplitude modulation is obtained by varying the amplitude of the carrier by the 
modulating signal, the change in amplitude from the unmodulated value being 
proportional to the instantaneous value of the modulating signal independent of its 
frequency. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Modulating signal in sinusoidal form can be written as 
vm=Vmcoswm t 
Carrier wave can be written as 
vc=Vccoswc t 
The amplitude of the modulated carrier is  
V(t)= Vc+ KaVmcoswm twhere Ka is the proportionality constant. 
The amplitude modulated carrier is represented by 
(vc)AM=Vc( 1+mcoswm t)coswc t 
where m(=KaVm/Vc) is known as the modulation index. 

AM Transmitter: 
 
CARRIER OSCILLATOR 
A oscillator is used to operate  the transmitted at a desirable fixed radio 
frequency (RF).The power output of the oscillator,being not sufficiently 
large,is amplified in several stage to the desirable. 
BUFFER AMPLIFIER 
This amplifier isolates the oscillate from the succeeding stage, so that the 
variation of coupling and antenna loading do not influence the oscillator 
frequency. 
FREQUENCY MULTIPLIER 
Oscillator cannot generate very high carrier frequencies. To obtain such 
frequencies, the frequency multiplier is used to multiply the frequency of 
oscillator output signal to the required value. 
POWER AMPLIFIER 
The modulated carrier is fed to this stage for final amplification before being 
carried to the antenna. 
AUDIO AMPLIFIER 

This amplifier is used to amplify the audio signal output of the microphone 
that converts the speech or music to be transmitted into equivalent electrical 
signal. 
MODULATOR 
The function of the modulator is to amplitude modulate the RF carriernin 
accordance with the amplified audio signal. 
AM RECIEVER 
 
ANTENNA 
    The antenna picks up all radiated signals and feeds them into the RF amplifier. 
These signals are very small (usually only a few microvolt). 
 RF AMPLIFIER                                                     
     This circuit can be adjusted (tuned) to select and amplify any carrier frequency 
within the AM broadcast band. Only the selected frequency and its two side bands 
pass through the amplifier. (Some AM receivers don't have a separate RF amplifier 
stage.) 
LOCAL OSCILLATOR                                                
   This circuit generates a steady sine wave at a frequency 455 KHz above the 
selected RF frequency. 
MIXER                                                                 
    This circuit accepts two inputs, the amplitude modulated RF signal from the 
output of the RF amplifier (or the antenna when there is no RF amplifier) and the 
sinusoidal output of the local oscillator (LO). These two signals are then "mixed" 
by a nonlinear process called heterodyning to produce sum and difference 

frequencies. For example, if the RF carrier has a frequency of 1000 KHz, the LO 
frequency is 1455 KHz and the sum and difference frequencies out of the mixer are 
2455 KHz and 455 KHz, respectively. The difference frequency is always 455 
KHz no matter what the RF carrier frequency. 
   IFAMPLIFIER                                                      
    The input to the If amplifier is the 455 KHz AM signal, a replica of the original 
AM carrier signal except that the frequency has been lowered to 455 KHz, The IF 
amplifier significantly increases the level of this signal. 
   DETECTOR                                                             
   This circuit recovers the modulating signal (audio signal) from the 455 KHz IF. 
At this point the IF is no longer needed, so the output of the detector consists of 
only the audio signal. 
 
   AUDIOANDPOWERAMPLIFIERS                           
   This circuit amplifies the detected audio signal and drives the speaker to produce 
sound. 
 
 
FM MODULATION 
 Mathematically, a frequency modulated (FM) waveform can be described using 
the equation 
 
  
 
where s(t) is the FM wave, Accos2πfct is the high frequency sinusoidal carrier and 
m(t) is the baseband message signal (the voice signal). The parameter kf is the 
frequency sensitivity of the FM modulator.

This transforms the audio amplitude changes into frequency changes of the

TRANSMITTER OSCILLATOTR 
An RF oscillator is used here to generate the desirable oscillations. 
FREQUENCY MULTIPLIER 
A number of frequency multipliers are used in this stage to raise the frequency to 
the required value. 
MIXER 
A part of the output of block of frequency fc and that of frequency fo .The frequency 
multipler block beat together in the mixer stage to produce a fc-fo Signal. 
IF AMPLIFIER 
The IF amplifier significantly increases amplitude of  fc-fo frequency component 
signal. 
DISCRIMINATOR:The output of the IF amplifietr is applied to a phase 
discriminator which gives a zero DC output voltage if the frequency of its input 
signal to which it is tuned remains constant. 
FM RECEIVER 

 
The RF amplifier amplifies the received signal intercepted by the antenna. The 
amplified signal is then applied to the mixer stage. 
The second input of the mixer comes from the local oscillator. The two input 
frequencies of the mixer generate an IF signal of 10.7 MHz. This signal is then 
amplified by the IF amplifier.. 
The output of the IF amplifier is applied to the limiter circuit. The limiter removes 
the noise in the received signal and gives a constant amplitude signal. This circuit 
is required when a phase discriminator is used to demodulate an FM signal.  
The output of the limiter is now applied to the FM discriminator, which recovers 
the modulating signal. However, this signal is still not the original modulating 
signal. Before applying it to the audio amplifier stages, it is de-emphasized.  
De-emphasizing attenuates the higher frequencies to bring them back to their 
original amplitudes as these are boosted or emphasized before transmission. The 
output of the de-emphasized stage is the audio signal, which is then applied to the 
audio 
stages 
and 
finally 
to 
the 
speaker.  
It should be noted that a limiter circuit is required with the FM discriminators. If 
the demodulator stage uses a ratio detector instead of the discriminator, then a 
limiter is not required. This is because the ratio detector limits the amplitude of the 
received signal. In Figure (a) a dotted block that covers the limiter and the 
discriminator is marked as the ratio detector.  
In FM receivers, generally, AGC is not required because the amplitude of the 
carrier is kept constant by the limiter circuit. Therefore, the input to the audio 
stages controls amplitudes and there are no erratic changes the volume level. 
However, AGC may be provided using an AGC detector. This generates a dc 
voltage to control the gains of the RF and IF amplifier.
