professionals. It also includes case history forms and a wide range of interpretive informa-
tion, interview questions for various and specific communicative disorders, and instructions 
and examples for reporting assessment information.
Part III provides a variety of materials and suggestions for assessing communicative disor-
ders. Chapter 5 includes general assessment procedures, materials, and worksheets common 
to all disorders. The remaining chapters are dedicated to specific communicative disorders. 
Each chapter contains a variety of reference materials, worksheets, procedural guidelines, 
and interpretive assessment information specifically designed to address the unique char-
acteristics of speech, fluency, language, voice, dysphagia, or neurologically based disorders. 
Part IV is a quick-reference section covering hearing disabilities; medical conditions 
associated with communicative disorders; normal speech, language, and motor development; 
and tables, images, and caregiver handouts.  Some tables and images from earlier chapters 
are duplicated in this section, but are presented in a caregiver-handout format to enhance 
the assessment process.
Each chapter includes a listing of ‚ÄúSources of Additional Information.‚Äù  The Internet 
sites recommended were deemed appropriate and stable at the time of printing.  Because the 
Internet is a dynamic environment, some sites may no longer exist or may have changed in 
content.  We apologize for any frustration this may cause.  New in this edition, apps appro-
priate for speech-language assessment are also recommended.  Again, this is a burgeoning 
industry and continually changing.  Consider those listed here a springboard into exploring 
apps for diagnostic purposes.  
Prior editions contained a CD with supplemental material.  We are pleased to now offer 
this content online. Forms found throughout the text are available in downloadable format 
to meet individual clinical needs.  Many of the stimulus materials used for assessment are 
also available, including storyboard art, illustrations, and reading passages.  These can be 
used in their digital form or downloaded and printed.  Clinicians are encouraged to down-
load content onto a flash drive or other portable storage device so that they have access to 
these files if they work in environments where Internet access is not readily available.
Assessment in Speech-Language Pathology: A Resource Manual can be a valuable resource 
for beginning or experienced clinicians. No other manual provides such a comprehensive 
package of reference materials, explanations of assessment procedures, practical stimulus 
suggestions, and hands-on worksheets and screening forms.

PART I Preparatory Considerations

efore venturing into the assessment process, it is important to gain an understanding of 
the underlying principles and philosophies of assessment in speech-language pathology. 
The foundations of assessment provide the framework for all clinical activities. This chapter 
will define assessment and describe the foundations of assessment that cause it to be mean-
ingful and useful.
OVERVIEW OF ASSESSMENT
Assessment is the process of collecting valid and reliable information, integrating it, and 
interpreting it to make a judgment or a decision about something. It is the process of mea-
suring communicative behaviors of interest. Assessment is synonymous with evaluation. 
The outcome of an assessment is usually a diagnosis, which is the clinical decision regard-
ing the presence or absence of a disorder and, often, the assignment of a diagnostic label. 
Speech-language pathologists use assessment information to make professional diagnoses 
and conclusions, identify the need for referral to other professionals, identify the need for 
treatment, determine the focus of treatment, determine the frequency and length of treat-
ment, and make decisions about the structure of treatment (e.g., individual versus group 
sessions, treatment with or without caregiver involvement). Ultimately, all initial clinical 
decisions are based on information derived from an assessment process.
For an assessment to be meaningful and useful, it must have foundational integrity. This 
integrity may be assured if each assessment adheres to these five principles:
1. A good assessment is thorough. It should incorporate as much relevant information  
as possible so that an accurate diagnosis and appropriate recommendations can be 
made.
2. A good assessment uses a variety of assessment modalities. It should include a combina-
tion of interview and case history information, formal and informal testing, and client 
observations.
3. A good assessment is valid. It should truly evaluate the intended skills.
4. A good assessment is reliable. It should accurately reflect the client‚Äôs communicative  
abilities and disabilities. Repeated evaluations of the same client should yield similar 
findings, provided there has been no change in the client‚Äôs status.
5. A good assessment is tailored to the individual client. Assessment materials that are  
appropriate for the client‚Äôs age, gender, skill levels, and ethnocultural background 
should be used.
Completing an assessment involves gathering relevant information, assimilating it, draw-
ing conclusions, and then sharing the findings and recommendations. We have summarized 
the process by providing this overview of seven steps the clinician should take in completing 
an assessment:
1. Obtain historical information about the client, the client‚Äôs family or caregivers, and 
the nature of the disorder.
2. Interview the client, the client‚Äôs family or caregivers, or both.
3. Evaluate the structural and functional integrity of the oralfacial mechanism.

4. Sample and evaluate the client‚Äôs speech and language use and abilities in the areas  
of articulation and speech, language, fluency, voice, and resonance. In the case of a  
dysphagia assessment, assess the client‚Äôs chewing and swallowing abilities.
5. Screen the client‚Äôs hearing or obtain evaluative information about hearing abilities.
6. Evaluate assessment information to determine impressions, diagnosis or conclusions, 
prognosis, and recommendations.
7. Share clinical findings through an interview with the client or caregiver, formal written 
records (such as a report), and informal verbal contacts (such as a telephone contact 
with a physician).
The overall emphasis of each assessment differs depending on the client, the type of 
disorder, the setting, the client‚Äôs history, the involvement of the caregivers, and other factors. 
For example:
 t Some disorders have extensive histories; others do not.
 t Clients have different primary communicative problems. Some exhibit problems  
of articulation, others of voice, still others of fluency, and so forth.
 t Some cases involve extensive interviewing; others do not.
 t Some cases require detailed written reports, whereas others do not.
Even though assessment emphases differ across clients, some consideration of each of 
the seven general areas listed above is necessary with most clients.
ASSESSMENT METHODS
The end purpose of an assessment in speech-language pathology is to draw a conclusion 
about an individual‚Äôs communicative abilities. The paths to that end are varied. There are 
several methods and approaches that are appropriate for validly and reliably collecting assess-
ment data. Regardless of the approach used, it is always important to use the most recent 
edition of a published test. This is required by insurance and law agencies, and it is also 
a best practice to not use outdated or obsolete materials. The following sections describe 
 norm-referenced assessment, criterion-referenced assessment, and authentic assessment ap-
proaches. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Although they are differentiated 
here, they sometimes overlap. Most clinicians use a combination of these methods to obtain 
the most complete assessment data.
Norm-Referenced Tests
Most of the commercially available tests used by speech-language pathologists are norm- 
referenced tests. They are most commonly used for evaluating clients for articulation or 
language disorders. Norm-referenced tests are always standardized. They allow a compari-
son of an individual‚Äôs performance to the performance of a larger group, called a normative 
group. Norm-referenced tests help answer the question, ‚ÄúHow does my client compare to the  
average?‚Äù It is the responsibility of test developers to determine normative standards that will 
identify what average is for a given test. Test developers accomplish this by administering the

test to a representative sample group. The results of this sample are analyzed to establish the 
normal distribution. This normal distribution then provides a range of scores by which others 
are judged when they take the same test.
The normal distribution is often depicted using a bell-shaped curve, as shown in  
Figure 1-1. The normal distribution is symmetrical. The height and width of the bell are 
dependent upon two quantities: the mean and the standard deviation. The mean determines 
the peak, and it represents the average performance. (In a perfect distribution, the peak also 
depicts the median, which is the middle of the distribution, and the mode, which is the most 
frequently occurring score.) The standard deviation determines the width, or spread, and it 
represents the distribution away from the group average. The Empirical Rule for a normal 
curve states that:
 t 68% of all outcomes will fall within one standard deviation of the mean (34% on each 
side).
 t 95% of all outcomes will fall within two standard deviations of the mean (47.5% on 
each side).
 t 99.7% of all outcomes will fall within three standard deviations of the mean (49.85% 
on each side).
There are advantages and disadvantages of using norm-referenced tests. Some of the 
advantages include the following:
 t The tests are objective.
 t The skills of an individual can be compared to those of a large group of similar 
individuals.

CHAPTER 1 Foundations of Assessment
 t Test administration is usually efficient.
 t Many norm-referenced tests are widely recognized, allowing for a common ground  
of discussion when other professionals are involved with the same client.
 t Clinicians are not required to have a high level of clinical experience and skill to  
administer and score tests (administration and interpretation guidelines are clearly 
specified in the accompanying manual).
 t Insurance companies and school districts prefer known test entities for third-party 
payment and qualification for services.
Some of the disadvantages include the following:
 t Norm-referenced tests do not allow for individualization.
 t Tests are generally static; they tell what a person knows, not how a person learns.
 t The testing situation may be unnatural and not representative of real life.
 t The approach evaluates isolated skills without considering other contributing factors.
 t Norm-referenced tests must be administered exactly as instructed for the results to be 
considered valid and reliable.
 t Test materials may not be appropriate for certain populations, such as culturally and 
linguistically diverse clients.
Criterion-Referenced Tests
Criterion-referenced tests do not attempt to compare an individual‚Äôs performance to any-
one else‚Äôs (as opposed to norm-referenced tests); rather they identify what a client can and 
cannot do compared to a predefined criterion. These tests help answer the question, ‚ÄúHow 
does my client‚Äôs performance compare to an expected level of performance?‚Äù Criterion- 
referenced tests assume that there is a level of performance that must be met for a behavior 
to be acceptable. Any performance below that level is considered deviant. For example, when 
evaluating an aphasic client, it is not helpful to compare the client‚Äôs speech and language 
skills to a normative group. It is much more meaningful to compare the client‚Äôs abilities to a 
clinical expectation‚Äîin this example, intelligible and functional speech and language.
Criterion-referenced tests are used most often when assessing clients for neurogenic dis-
orders, fluency disorders, and voice disorders. They may also be used for evaluating some as-
pects of articulation or language. Criterion-referenced tests may or may not be standardized.
There are advantages and disadvantages of using criterion-referenced tests. Some of the 
advantages include the following:
 t The tests are usually objective.
 t Test administration is usually efficient.
 t Many criterion-referenced tests are widely recognized, allowing for a common 
ground of discussion when other professionals are involved with the same client.
 t Insurance companies and school districts prefer known test entities for third-party 
payment and for qualification for services.
 t With nonstandardized criterion-referenced tests, there is some opportunity for 
individualization.

Some of the disadvantages include the following:
 t The testing situation may be unnatural and not representative of real life.
 t The approach evaluates isolated skills without considering other contributing factors.
 t Standardized criterion-referenced tests do not allow for individualization.
 t Standardized criterion-referenced tests must be administered exactly as instructed for 
the results to be considered valid and reliable.
Authentic Assessment Approach
Authentic assessment is also known as alternative assessment or nontraditional assessment. 
Like criterion-referenced assessment, authentic assessment identifies what a client can 
and cannot do. The differentiating aspect of authentic assessment is its emphasis on 
contextualized test stimuli. The test environment is more realistic and natural. For ex-
ample, when assessing a client with a fluency disorder, it may not be meaningful to use 
contrived repeat-after-me test materials. It may be more valid to observe the client in 
real-life situations, such as talking on the phone to a friend or talking with family mem-
bers during a meal at home.
Another feature of authentic assessment is that it is ongoing. The authentic assess-
ment approach evaluates the client‚Äôs performance during diagnostic and treatment phases.  
Assessment information is maintained in a client portfolio, which offers a broad portrait of 
the client‚Äôs skills across time and in different settings. When appropriate, the client actively 
participates in reviewing the portfolio and adding new materials. This provides an oppor-
tunity for the client to practice self-monitoring and self-evaluation. Artifacts of the client‚Äôs 
performance on standardized tests, nonstandardized tests, and treatment tasks are items that 
are included in the client‚Äôs portfolio.
Using an authentic assessment approach requires more clinical skill, experience, and  
creativity than does formal assessment because skills are assessed qualitatively. Testing  
environments are manipulated to the point of eliciting desired behavior, yet not so much 
that the authentic aspect of the client‚Äôs responses is negated. There are several strategies 
recommended for evaluating clients using an authentic assessment approach, which can be 
modified for different clinical situations. They are:
 t Systematic observations
 t Real-life simulations
 t Language sampling
 t Structured symbolic play
 t Short-answer and extended-answer responses
 t Self-monitoring and self-assessment
 t Use of anecdotal notes and checklists
 t Videotaping
 t Audiotaping
 t Involvement of caregivers and other professionals

FOUNDATIONS OF
ASSESSMENT
CHAPTER 1 Foundations of Assessment
There are advantages and disadvantages to using an authentic assessment approach.  
Advantages include the following:
 t The approach is natural and similar to the real world.
 t Clients participate in self-evaluation and self-monitoring.
 t The approach allows for individualization. This is particularly beneficial with cultur-
ally diverse clients or special needs clients, such as those who use Augmentative or 
Alternate Communication (AAC) systems.
 t The approach offers flexibility.
Disadvantages include the following:
 t The approach may lack objectivity.
 t Procedures are not usually standardized, thus reliability and validity are less  
assured.
 t Implementation requires a high level of clinical experience and skill.
 t The approach is not efficient, requiring a lot of planning time.
 t Authentic assessment may be impractical in some situations.
 t Insurance companies and school districts prefer known test entities for third-party 
payment and qualification for services.
Dynamic assessment (DA) is a form of authentic assessment. The purpose of dynamic 
assessment is to evaluate a client‚Äôs learning potential based on his or her ability to modify 
responses after the clinician provides teaching or other assistance. It is an especially appro-
priate strategy when assessing clients with cognitive communication disorders or those from 
culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (enabling clinicians to distinguish between 
a language disorder and language difference).
The dynamic assessment approach follows a test-teach-retest method. Specifically:
1. A test is administered without prompts or cues to determine current performance.
2. The clinician teaches strategies specific to the skills being evaluated, observing the  
client‚Äôs response to instruction and adjusting teaching accordingly. (This is referred to 
as a mediated learning experience, or MLE.)
3. The test is re-administered and results from the pre- and post-test are compared.
The clinician pays particular attention to teaching strategies that were effective at improving 
the client‚Äôs success. These may include use of cuing (e.g., verbal, visual, tactile, or auditory), 
graduated prompting, making environmental adjustments, conversational teaching (e.g., 
asking questions such as ‚ÄúWhy did you . . .?‚Äù and then instructing ‚ÄúAh, I see . . . .‚Äù), or other 
strategies.
Dynamic assessment allows the clinician, as part of the diagnostic process, to determine 
baseline ability and identify appropriate goals and strategies for intervention. If one of the 
clinician‚Äôs purposes is to discern a language difference versus a language impairment, it is 
helpful to note that clients who do not demonstrate improvement following teaching likely 
have a language impairment, whereas clients who are able to make positive changes follow-
ing brief teaching experiences are likely to have a language difference.

PART I Preparatory Considerations
PSYCHOMETRIC PRINCIPLES
Psychometrics refers to the measurement of human traits, abilities, and certain processes. It is 
what speech-language pathologists do when evaluating a client‚Äôs communication. The basic 
principles of psychometrics are described in the following sections. Read one of the texts on 
research methodology and evaluation listed in the ‚ÄúSources of Additional Information‚Äù at 
the end of this chapter for more detailed information on these principles.
Validity
Test validity means that a test truly measures what it claims to measure. There are several 
types of validity:
 t Face validity means that a test looks like it assesses the skill it claims to assess. A lay-
person can make this judgment. Face validity alone is not a valuable measure of valid-
ity because it is based merely on appearance, not on content or outcomes.
 t Content validity means that a test‚Äôs contents are representative of the content do-
main of the skill being assessed. For example, a valid articulation test should elicit all 
phonemes, thereby assessing the spectrum of articulation. Content validity is related 
to face validity; content validity, though, judges the actual content of the test (rather 
than superficial appearance) and is judged by individuals with expert knowledge.
 t Construct validity means a test measures a predetermined theoretical construct, which 
is an explanation of a behavior or attribute based on empirical observation. For ex-
ample, the theoretical construct that preschool children‚Äôs language skills improve with 
age is based on language development studies. Therefore, a valid test of early language 
development will show improved language skills when administered to normally  
developing preschool children of progressively increasing ages.
 t Criterion validity refers to validity that is established by use of an external criterion. 
There are two types of criterion validity:
 - Concurrent validity refers to a test‚Äôs validity in comparison to a widely accepted 
standard. For example, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale is already accepted  
as a valid assessment of intelligence. Newer intelligence tests are compared to the  
Stanford-Binet, which serves as the criterion measure.
 - Predictive validity refers to a test‚Äôs ability to predict performance (the criterion 
measure) in another situation or at a later time. It implies that there is a known 
relationship between the behaviors the test measures and the behaviors or skills ex-
hibited at some future time. College entrance exams, such as the Graduate Record 
Examination (GRE), are used because of their predictive validity. The GRE scores 
are expected to predict future academic performance.
Reliability
Reliability means results are replicable. When administered properly, a test gives consistent 
results on repeated administrations or with different interpreters judging the same adminis-
tration. There are several types of reliability:
 t Test-retest reliability refers to a test‚Äôs stability over time. It is determined by adminis-
tering the same test multiple times to the same group and then comparing the scores.

FOUNDATIONS OF
ASSESSMENT
CHAPTER 1 Foundations of Assessment
If the scores from the different administrations are the same or very similar, the test is 
considered stable and reliable.
 t Split-half reliability refers to a test‚Äôs internal consistency. Scores from one half of the 
test correlate with results from the other half of the test. The halves must be com-
parable in style and scope and all items should assess the same skill. This is often 
achieved by dividing the test into odd-numbered questions and even-numbered 
questions.
 t Rater reliability refers to the level of agreement among individuals rating a test. It is 
determined by administering a single test and audio- or videotaping it so it can be 
scored multiple times. There are two types of rater reliability:
 - Intra-rater reliability is established if results are consistent when the same person 
rates the test on more than one occasion.
 - Inter-rater reliability is established if results are consistent when more than one  
person rates the test.
 t Alternate form reliability, also called parallel form reliability, refers to a test‚Äôs correla-
tion coefficient with a similar test. It is determined by administering a test (Test A) 
to a group of people and then administering a parallel form of the test (Test B) to 
the same group of people. The two sets of test results are compared to determine the 
test‚Äôs alternate form reliability.
Standardization
There are many commercially available speech and language assessment tools that are 
standardized. Standardized tests, also called formal tests, are those that provide stan-
dard procedures for the administration and scoring of the test. Standardization is  
accomplished so that test-giver bias and other extraneous influences do not affect the 
client‚Äôs performance and so that results from different people are comparable. Most of 
the standardized tests clinicians use are norm-referenced. But standardized is not synon-
ymous with norm-referenced. Any type of test can be standardized as long as uniform test  
administration and scoring are used.
Test developers are responsible for clearly outlining the standardization and psychomet-
ric aspects of a test. Each test‚Äôs manual should include information about:
 t The purpose(s) of the test
 t The age range for which the test is designed and standardized
 t Test construction and development
 t Administration and scoring procedures
 t The normative sample group and statistical information derived from it
 t Test reliability
 t Test validity
It is important to become familiar with this information before using any standard-
ized test for assessment purposes. Lack of familiarity with this information or inappropriate  
application of it could render results useless or false.
Form 1-1, ‚ÄúTest Evaluation Form,‚Äù is a worksheet that may be helpful for evaluating test 
manuals to determine whether they are worthwhile assessment tools. It is also helpful to read

test reviews in professional journals or to consult analyses published by the Buros Institute of 
Mental Measurements, an organization dedicated to monitoring the quality of commercially 
published tests.
STANDARDIZED TEST ADMINISTRATION
Read the accompanying manual before administering any standardized test. Each is unique 
in administration protocols and scoring. There are some foundational principles that apply 
to most tests, and these are described in the following sections.
Determining Chronological Age
Chronological age is the exact age of a person in years, months, and days. It is important for 
analyzing findings from standardized tests, as it allows the clinician to convert raw data into 
meaningful scores.
To calculate chronological age:
1. Record the test administration date as year, month, day.
2. Record the client‚Äôs birth date as year, month, day.
3. Subtract the birth date from the test date. If necessary, borrow 12 months from the year 
column and add to the month column, reducing the year by one, and/or borrow 30 or 
31 days (based on number of days in month borrowed from) from the months column 
and add to the days column, reducing the month by one.
Two examples are presented here. The first is a complicated example, requiring two  
instances of borrowing‚Äî12 months were borrowed from the year column, and 31 days were 
borrowed from the month column (which became May, not April, after the first borrow, so 
31 days borrowed):
Test date is April 2, 2015. Client‚Äôs birth date is December 12, 2008.

Chronological age is 10 years, 2 months, 15 days.
Easy-to-use chronological age calculators are available online and as apps that can be 
downloaded onto smartphones or tablets. The user plugs in the test date and birth date and 
chronological age is automatically calculated. A few of the free chronological age calculators 
available include:
 t Chronological Age Calculator App, by Smarty Ears Apps
 t Pearson Assessments, Chronological Age Calculator: http://www.pearsonassess 
ments.com/hai/Images/ageCalculator/ageCalculator.htm
 t Super Duper Publications, Chronological Age Calculator: available as an app or  
online at http://www.superduperinc.com/AgeCalculator/
For preemie infants and toddlers, it is important to consider adjusted age, also referred to 
as corrected age. Adjusted age takes into account the gestational development that was missed 
due to premature delivery. For example, a normal 10-month old baby born 8 weeks prema-
ture would be more similar, developmentally, to a normal 8-month old. This is important 
when considering milestones that have or have not been achieved and when applying stan-
dardized norms. Adjusted age is determined by using the child‚Äôs due date, rather than actual 
birth date, when calculating chronological age. Adjusted age becomes less relevant as a child 
grows, and is generally not a consideration for children over age 3.
Basals and Ceilings
Basal refers to the starting point for test administration and scoring. Ceiling refers to the 
ending point. Basals and ceilings allow the tester to hone in on only the most relevant testing 
material. It would not be worthwhile or efficient, for example, to spend time assessing pre-
speech babbling skills in a client who speaks in sentences, or vice versa.
It is important to read test manuals to determine basals and ceilings. Typically, a start-
ing point is suggested according to a client‚Äôs age. The basal is then established by eliciting 
a certain number of consecutively correct responses. If the basal cannot be established 
from the recommended starting point, test items before the suggested starting point are 
administered until the predetermined number of consecutively correct responses is elic-
ited. For example, if a test‚Äôs basal is three consecutively correct responses, and the recom-
mended starting point is test item #20, the tester will start test administration on item 
#20. If, however, the client does not answer three consecutive prompts correctly, the tester 
will work backwards from test item #20 until the basal is established (i.e., administer test 
items #19, #18, #17, etc.).

14
PART I Preparatory Considerations
The test ceiling is also predetermined and stated in the test manual. A ceiling is typically 
determined by a requisite number of consecutively incorrect responses. It is imperative to 
review the manual before administering a test. Basals and ceilings vary with every test. Many 
tests do not have a basal or ceiling and are designed to be administered in their entirety. And 
in some cases, certain subsets of an individual test require a basal and ceiling, whereas other 
subtests of the same test do not.
Standardized Administration, Modification, and Accommodation
Standardized tests are designed to be administered in a formulaic manner. That makes them, 
by definition, standardized. It is important to administer test items according to the protocol 
outlined in the test manual. For example, if the test is to be administered without repeating 
prompts or cuing, then do not repeat or cue. If the test is to be administered within a spec-
ified period of time, do not allow extra time. It is also important to understand the popula-
tion for which the test was designed. Normative scores are not valid for a client who is not 
reflected in the normative sample, even when standardized administration is applied. That 
said, our clients do not always match a test‚Äôs profile, and special considerations sometimes 
need to be made when administering a test.
Accommodations are minor adjustments to a testing situation that do not compromise 
a test‚Äôs standardized procedure. For example, large-print versions of visual stimuli may 
be used, or an aide may assist with recorded responses. As long as the content is not 
altered, the findings are still considered valid and norm-referenced scores can still be 
applied.
In contrast, modifications are changes to the test‚Äôs standardized administration protocol. 
For example, a test giver might re-word or simplify instructions, allow extra time on timed 
tests, repeat prompts, offer verbal or visual cues, skip test items, allow the test taker to explain 
or correct responses, and so forth. Any such instance of altering the standardized manner of 
administration invalidates the norm-referenced scores.
Understanding Standardized Test Scores
Once a test is administered, scores can be calculated and findings can be interpreted. A raw 
score is the initial score obtained based on number of correct responses. Read the test manual 
to determine how to calculate raw scores (and other scores) for a given test. Some tests award 
more than one point for a correct response. Incorrect calculation of raw score will skew all 
findings and make test results inaccurate. Raw scores are not meaningful until converted to 
scaled scores, which include z-scores, percentiles, and stanines. Scaled scores allow the tester 
to compare the abilities of the test taker to the appropriate normative sample (as defined by 
the test designer in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, etc.).
A z-score, also called standard score, allows the clinician to compare the client‚Äôs score to 
the normative sample. The z-score tells how many standard deviations the raw score is from 
the mean. The z-score is useful because it shows where an individual score lies along the 
continuum of the bell-shaped curve, and thus tells how different the test taker‚Äôs score is from 
the average.
Percentile rank is another expression of individual standing in comparison to the nor-
mal distribution. The percentile rank tells the percentage of people scoring at or below a

CHAPTER 1 Foundations of Assessment
particular score. For example, scoring in the 75th percentile indicates that the individual 
scored higher than 75% of the people taking the same test. The 50th percentile is the median;  
50% of the test takers obtained the median score.
Stanine (standard nine) is an additional method of ranking an individual‚Äôs test perfor-
mance. A stanine is a score based on a 9-unit scale, where a score of 5 describes average per-
formance. Each stanine unit (except for 1 and 9) is equally distributed across the curve. Most 
people (54%) score stanines of 4, 5, or 6; few people (8%) score a stanine of 1 or 9.
Test manuals provide specific instructions for interpreting raw scores. It is always im-
portant to read the statistical data in each test manual before drawing conclusions about a 
client‚Äôs performance. As a general guideline, though, there is cause for concern if a client per-
forms near the bottom 5% of the normal distribution, or approximately 21.5 to 22 standard 
deviations below the mean (Haynes & Pindzola, 2012).
The confidence interval represents the degree of certainty on the part of the test developer 
that the statistical values obtained are true. Confidence intervals allow for natural human 
variability to be taken into consideration. Many test manuals provide statistical data for a 
confidence interval of 95% (some lower, but the higher the better when considering test 
reliability). This allows the clinician to obtain a range of possible scores in which the true 
value of the score exists 95% of the time. In other words, a 95% confidence interval provides 
a range of reliable scores, not just a single reliable score.
Many test manuals provide scores for age equivalence (or sometimes grade equiva-
lence). Be aware that these scores are the least useful and most misleading scores ob-
tained from a standardized test. An age-equivalent score is the average raw score for a 
particular age. For example, if 30 is the average raw score for 8-year olds, then all test 
takers who obtain a raw score of 30 obtain an age-equivalent score of 8 years. Although 
it seems logical that raw scores transfer easily to age equivalence, age-equivalent scores 
do not take into account the normal distribution of scores within a population. It would 
be incorrect to conclude that a 10-year-old child with an age-equivalent score of 8 years 
is performing below expectations based on age equivalence alone. It could very well be 
true that the 10-year-old‚Äôs score is within the range of normal variation. Age-equivalent 
and grade-equivalent scores are not considered a reliable measure and should generally 
not be used.
HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY  
AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA)
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law designed to 
improve the health care system by:
 t Allowing consumers to continue and transfer health insurance coverage after a job 
change or job loss,
 t Reducing health care fraud,
 t Mandating industry-wide standards for electronic transmission of health care infor-
mation and billing, and
 t Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of health information.

PART I Preparatory Considerations
The law affects all consumers of health services. It also affects all health care practi-
tioners who transmit any information in electronic form for which a national standard has 
been established. Many speech-language pathologists, particularly those working in a pri-
vate practice, are required to comply with the law. Clinicians who are uncertain if they are 
a ‚Äúcovered entity‚Äù (required participant) should certainly do their homework to find out. 
And, if they are covered entities, they should follow the letter of the law, as there are signifi-
cant fines for noncompliance. HIPAA is regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and  
Human Services (DHHS). Detailed information about HIPAA, including what constitutes 
a covered entity, electronic submission standards, privacy policies, and more, can be found on 
the DHHS website at www.hhs.gov.
Some of the major requirements of HIPAA that affect speech-language pathologists 
include the following:
 t Health care providers must obtain a National Provider Identifier (NPI) number.
 t All clients must be given a copy of the clinician‚Äôs privacy policies. Clients must sign 
an acknowledgement that they received a copy. The privacy policy must also be 
posted in a prominent location in the clinician‚Äôs place of business.
 t All protected health information must be handled confidentially. Clinicians may 
transmit only the minimum information about a client that is necessary to conduct 
business. This applies to oral, paper, and electronic information.
 t National standards for electronic health care transactions must be followed.
 t Clinicians must maintain an ‚Äúaccounting of disclosures,‚Äù which is a record of all in-
stances when a client‚Äôs information is shared.
 t Business associates who manage health care information on behalf of a provider must 
also comply with HIPAA regulations.
These points are for general knowledge only. The need for clinicians who are covered entities 
to do further research and become informed providers cannot be overemphasized.
CODE OF FAIR TESTING PRACTICES IN EDUCATION
The Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education, presented in Figure 1-2, was developed by 
the Joint Committee on Testing Practices, which is sponsored by professional associations 
such as the American Psychological Association, the National Council on Measurement  
in Education, the American Association for Counseling and Development, and the  
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. The guidelines in the Code were devel-
oped primarily for use with commercially available and standardized tests, although many of 
the principles also apply to informal testing situations.
There are two parts to the Code: one is for test developers and publishers, the other  
is for those who administer and use the tests. Only the sections for test users are presented 
in Figure 1-2.

FOUNDATIONS OF
ASSESSMENT
CHAPTER 1 Foundations of Assessment
A. Selecting Appropriate Tests. Test users should select tests that meet the intended 
purpose and that are appropriate for the intended test takers.
 1. Define the purpose for testing, the content and skills to be tested, and the 
intended test takers. Select and use the most appropriate test based on a thor-
ough review of available information.
 2. Review and select tests based on the appropriateness of test content, skills 
tested, and content coverage for the intended purpose of testing.
 3. Review materials provided by test developers and select tests for which clear, 
accurate, and complete information is provided.
 4. Select tests through a process that includes persons with appropriate knowl-
edge, skills, and training.
 5. Evaluate evidence of the technical quality of the test provided by the test de-
veloper and any independent reviewers.
 6. Evaluate representative samples of test questions or practice tests, directions, 
answer sheets, manuals, and score reports before selecting a test.
 7. Evaluate procedures and materials used by test developers, as well as the 
resulting test, to ensure that potentially offensive content or language is 
avoided.
 8. Select tests with appropriately modified forms or administration procedures 
for test takers with disabilities who need special accommodations.
 9. Evaluate the available evidence on the performance of test takers of diverse 
subgroups. Determine, to the extent feasible, which performance differences 
may have been caused by factors unrelated to the skills being assessed.
B. Administering and Scoring Tests. Test users should administer and score tests cor-
rectly and fairly.
 1. Follow established procedures for administering tests in a standardized 
manner.
 2. Provide and document appropriate procedures for test takers with disabili-
ties who need special accommodations or those with diverse linguistic back-
grounds. Some accommodations may be required by law or regulation.
 3. Provide test takers with an opportunity to become familiar with test question 
formats and any materials or equipment that may be used during testing.
 4. Protect the security of test materials, including respecting copyrights and 
eliminating opportunities for test takers to obtain scores by fraudulent 
means.
 5. If test scoring is the responsibility of the test user, provide adequate training 
to scorers and ensure and monitor the accuracy of the scoring process.
 6. Correct errors that affect the interpretation of the scores and communicate 
the corrected results promptly.
 7. Develop and implement procedures for ensuring the confidentiality of scores.

PART I Preparatory Considerations
C. Reporting and Interpreting Test Results. Test users should report and interpret test 
results accurately and clearly.
 1. Interpret the meaning of the test results, taking into account the nature of the 
content, norms or comparison groups, other technical evidence, and benefits 
and limitations of test results.
 2. Interpret test results from modified test or test administration procedures in 
view of the impact those modifications may have had on test results.
 3. Avoid using tests for purposes other than those recommended by the test  
developer unless there is evidence to support the intended use or interpretation.
 4. Review the procedures for setting performance standards or passing scores. 
Avoid using stigmatizing labels.
 5. Avoid using a single test score as the sole determinant of decisions about 
test takers. Interpret test scores in conjunction with other information about 
individuals.
 6. State the intended interpretation and use of test results for groups of test 
takers. Avoid grouping test results for purposes not specifically recommended 
by the test developer unless evidence is obtained to support the intended 
use. Report procedures that were followed in determining who were and who 
were not included in the groups being compared, and describe factors that 
might influence the interpretation of results.
 7. Communicate test results in a timely fashion and in a manner that is under-
stood by the test taker.
 8. Develop and implement procedures for monitoring test use, including consis-
tency with the intended purposes of the test.
D. Informing Test Takers. Test users should inform test takers about the nature of the 
test, test taker rights and responsibilities, the appropriate use of scores, and proce-
dures for resolving challenges to scores.
 1. Inform test takers in advance of the test administration about the coverage 
of the test, the types of question formats, the directions, and appropriate 
test-taking strategies. Make such information available to all test takers.
 2. When a test is optional, provide test takers or their parents/guardians with 
information to help them judge whether a test should be taken‚Äîincluding 
indications of any consequences that may result from not taking the test (e.g., 
not being eligible to compete for a particular scholarship)‚Äîand whether 
there is an available alternative to the test.
 3. Provide test takers or their parents/guardians with information about rights 
test takers may have to obtain copies of tests and completed answer sheets, to 
retake tests, to have tests rescored, or to have scores declared invalid.
 4. Provide test takers or their parents/guardians with information about respon-
sibilities test takers have, such as being aware of the intended purpose and uses

FOUNDATIONS OF
ASSESSMENT
CHAPTER 1 Foundations of Assessment
CODE OF ETHICS FOR SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS
Speech-language pathologists have an obligation to provide services with professional  
integrity, achieve the highest possible level of clinical competence, and serve the needs of the 
public. Clinicians need to be aware of biases and prejudices that may be personally held or 
prevalent in society. Such biases and prejudices should not hinder the assessment process. It 
is the clinician‚Äôs responsibility to determine whether a communicative disorder exists, and if 
so, recommend a treatment plan that is in the best interests of the client. Negative feelings 
or attitudes should never affect clinical impressions or decisions.
Principles of professional ethics and conduct are outlined in the American Speech- 
Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Code of Ethics. The ASHA Code of Ethics can 
be found online at http://www.asha.org/Code-of-Ethics/.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
This chapter highlighted the foundational aspects of assessment. Assessment was defined 
and the overall assessment process was outlined. Psychometric principles were discussed. 
Information about norm-referenced, criterion-referenced, and authentic assessment was 
provided, including advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Although each aspect 
of assessment was differentiated from the others, in true clinical settings some of these con-
cepts and approaches overlap.
of the test, performing at capacity, following directions, and not disclosing 
test items or interfering with other test takers.
 5. Inform test takers or their parents/guardians how long scores will be kept on 
file and indicate to whom, under what circumstances, and in what manner 
test scores and related information will or will not be released. Protect test 
scores from unauthorized release and access.
 6. Describe procedures for investigating and resolving circumstances that might 
result in canceling or withholding scores, such as failure to adhere to specified 
testing procedures.
 7. Describe procedures that test takers, parents/guardians, and other interested 
parties may use to obtain more information about the test, register complaints, 
and have problems resolved.

C
ulturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) clients present unique challenges to clinicians 
assessing communicative skills. These clients come from a wide range of socioeconomic 
circumstances, educational and cultural linguistic backgrounds, and personal experiences. 
They also demonstrate varying degrees of English proficiency. No single chapter or book 
can provide all of the information needed to effectively serve each individual. The materials 
presented in this chapter are intended to provide core information and serve as a springboard 
for becoming fully prepared to assess CLD clients.
PREASSESSMENT KNOWLEDGE
Evaluating a client with a multicultural linguistic background often requires some amount 
of preassessment research. Before evaluating a CLD client, a clinician needs to understand 
the client‚Äôs culture, normal communication development associated with the culture, and the 
client‚Äôs personal history. Without this knowledge, assessment procedures may be inappropri-
ate, and diagnostic conclusions may be incorrect.
Know the Culture of the Client
Every culture has a set of pragmatic social rules that guide communicative behaviors. Knowl-
edge of these rules enables clinicians to exchange information with clients and their care-
givers in a culturally sensitive manner. A disregard for these rules may be offensive, could 
result in misunderstandings, and could lead to an inaccurate diagnosis. We have listed several 
social customs and beliefs that may be relevant when communicating with CLD clients and 
caregivers. Information about specific cultural groups was obtained from Goldstein (2000), 
Roseberry-McKibbin (2008), and Westby (2002). Be aware that within each culture, there is 
individual variation. What is true for a culture as a whole may not be true for an individual 
from that culture.
1. Cultural groups have differing views of disability and intervention. In some cultures 
(e.g., Asian), having a disability is considered the person‚Äôs fate and any recommended 
intervention may be considered futile. In other cultures, parents may feel personally 
responsible for a child‚Äôs disability (e.g., certain Hispanic groups). In certain religions 
(e.g., Hindu, Native American Spiritism), it is believed that a disability is a spiritual 
gift or punishment. In these cases, the client may be opposed to any intervention that 
would change the disability. Some cultures (e.g., Asian, Native American) rely on 
non-Western methods of treatment or healing, such as herbal remedies, massage, hot 
baths, and acupuncture, and may be skeptical of a clinician‚Äôs ability to help.
2. Cultural groups hold diverse views of a woman‚Äôs role in society. In some cultures  
(e.g., Arab), clients or their caregivers may not respect female professionals. It may  
be socially inappropriate for a female professional to make any physical contact with  
a man, such as a handshake, or to ask a man direct questions. Female caregivers may 
not respect suggestions offered by a female professional who is not also a mother. 
These cultural social rules can be particularly problematic because many speech- 
language pathologists are women. In some cultures (e.g., Asian), women and young 
girls are primarily care providers for the family, and school-aged girls may be fre-
quently absent from or drop out of school to care for other family members at home.

27
MULTICULTURAL
CONSIDERATIONS
CHAPTER 2 Multicultural Considerations 
3. Cultural groups hold different views of familial authority. In some cultures (e.g., Middle 
Eastern regions, Hispanic, Asian), the father is the spokesperson for the family and 
the highest authority. Addressing anyone other than the father may be considered  
disrespectful. In other cultures (e.g., Asian, Middle Eastern regions, Native American), 
it is the godparents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, or tribal elders who make familial 
decisions.
4. Names and titles you will use during communicative exchanges may vary among different  
cultures. In some cultures (e.g., Asian), it is more common to address certain family 
members by relationship rather than name (e.g., Grandmother rather than Mrs. Chang). 
When you are unsure, it is best to simply ask how an individual prefers to be addressed.
5. Certain cultural groups may be uncomfortable with many of the case history and interview 
questions that are often asked in some settings in the United States. In some cultures (e.g., 
African American), certain questions may be perceived as rude and highly personal. In 
these cases, it is wise to establish a rapport with the client and caregivers before asking 
personal questions. This may require that all of the salient information is gathered 
across multiple visits rather than during an initial interview.
6. Certain cultural groups may be uncomfortable with some of the testing practices we tra-
ditionally use. For example, not all cultural groups use pseudoquestions. These are 
 questions that are asked not to gain new knowledge but to test the person being  
questioned. In our mainstream culture it is common to ask a child ‚ÄúWhere is your 
nose?‚Äù even when we already know where the child‚Äôs nose is. Some CLD clients  
(e.g., Native American) would probably not answer the question so as not to insult  
the person asking. In a diagnostic session, this cultural difference requires the clinician 
to be particularly creative in assessing a client‚Äôs speech and language abilities. In some 
cultures (e.g., African American, Hispanic, Native American), children learn mostly 
by observation. These clients may be unwilling to attempt unfamiliar tasks or may 
expect a demonstration of assessment tasks. ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù itself may be a completely unfa-
miliar concept.
7. Individual achievement is viewed differently among cultural groups. In some cultural 
groups (e.g., Middle Eastern, African American) group performance is valued more 
highly than individual performance; showing individual achievement, as expected in 
many traditional testing situations, may be socially inappropriate. Some cultures  
(e.g., Asian) value humility and modesty very highly. Touting individual achievement 
may be frowned upon.
8. Cultural groups hold differing views about a child‚Äôs behavior in the company of adults.  
In some cultural groups (e.g., Asian), children are expected to be seen and not heard. 
In other groups, children do not initiate conversations (e.g., Hispanic). In contrast, 
people from certain cultures (e.g., African American) expect a very high level of  
conversational participation from their children.
9. Cultural groups maintain different views about the use of eye contact in communication. In 
some cultures (e.g., African American, Hispanic), it is disrespectful for a child to make 
frequent or prolonged eye contact with adults because it is perceived as a challenge 
to authority. In Asian populations, adults also avoid prolonged eye contact with other 
adults. In contrast, in mainstream American culture, we expect children and adults to 
look us in the eyes when we speak to them.

PART I Preparatory Considerations
10. Cultural groups view time differently. In some cultures (e.g., Hispanic, Native  
American, Middle Eastern), arriving on time for an appointment or answering  
questions within a proposed time frame is superfluous.
11. Different cultural groups express disapproval in varying ways. In some cultures (e.g., 
Asian), it can be considered inappropriate to contradict others. Caregivers may appear 
cooperative and agreeable during interview situations; however, they may be merely 
‚Äúsaving face‚Äù or showing courteous respect while having no intention of following 
through with your recommendations or requests. They may also smile and appear 
agreeable, even when they are quite angry.
12. Perceptions of personal space vary across cultures. In some cultures (e.g., Middle Eastern, 
Hispanic, Asian), it may be common to have many people living in a relatively small 
home or apartment. Also, in some cultures (e.g., Hispanic), physical distance between 
people is rather close. They may be offended if you step away from them during 
conversation. In contrast, other cultures (e.g., Japanese) are more comfortable with 
a greater amount of personal space. In some cultures (African American), physical 
touch is used to express approval. In contrast, other cultures (Japanese) exhibit very 
limited physical contact during social interactions.
13. Certain cultural groups expect varying amounts of small talk before engaging in the business 
at hand. In some cultures (e.g., Hispanic, Arab), it is rude to jump right to business 
without engaging in a satisfactory level of preliminary small talk.
14. Some cultural groups harbor generalized mistrust of other cultural groups. These are typically 
politically driven hostilities. Whether justified or not, it is important to be aware of them.
The degree to which an individual has been acculturated into the mainstream American 
culture will shape the adherence to these social rules. Some individuals may not share most 
of the dispositions common to their cultural background. In such cases, stereotyping them 
would be offensive. For instance, it would be inappropriate to assume that an Asian woman 
is a full-time care provider when, in fact, she is a highly educated professional pursuing a 
full-time career.
Ethnography is one method of becoming more culturally knowledgeable. Ethnography 
is the scientific study of a culture. Ethnographic research is accomplished by observing and 
interviewing members of a culture. Its purpose is to understand a culture from an insider‚Äôs 
perspective without interjecting personal judgments or biases.
The ‚ÄúClinician‚Äôs Cultural Competence Worksheet,‚Äù Form 2-1, is helpful for collecting 
information about a client‚Äôs cultural background. There are several potential strategies for 
obtaining this information:
 t Interview members of the cultural community.
 t Observe the members of the community in naturalistic situations.
 t Ask the client to share about his or her culture.
 t Consult with other professionals, particularly speech-language pathologists who are 
from the same cultural group or who have extensive experience working with individ-
uals from that group.
 t Read as much relevant professional literature as possible.
 t Read some of the classical literature from the client‚Äôs culture.

CHAPTER 2 Multicultural Considerations 
Know the History of the Client
In addition to the questions asked as part of a traditional case history, there are questions 
particularly relevant to the assessment of CLD clients. Answers to certain questions offer 
insight into a client‚Äôs current and past cultural linguistic environments.
Form 2-2, the ‚ÄúMulticultural Case History Form for Children,‚Äù and Form 2-3, the

tion. They are intended to supplement the standard child and adult history forms provided 
in Chapter 3 of this manual. Be sensitive about how this information is obtained. In some 
cases, it may be best to gather it orally. For example, individuals with limited English pro-
ficiency may not understand the questions or be able to write the responses. Other respon-
dents may be intimidated or offended by the personal nature of some of the questions. It 
may be most prudent to ask these questions after having met with the client and caregivers 
several times and to establish a positive rapport. It may be necessary to ask an interpreter 
to translate the forms.
Know the Normal Communicative Patterns  
of the Client‚Äôs Dominant Language
It is important to be familiar with normal communication patterns associated with a cul-
tural group; otherwise it will be difficult to determine whether a client is demonstrating a 
communicative disorder or a communicative difference. The appendices at the end of this 
chapter include several tables that provide information about normal speech-language pat-
terns and development among African American English speakers, Spanish speakers, and 
Asian language speakers. Unfortunately, for many languages there are no published data that 
help identify what is normal versus what is delayed or disordered. In these situations, clini-
cians must do some investigating. This is usually accomplished by interviewing others who 
are very familiar with the cognitive and linguistic developmental patterns of the language. 
Sources of this information may include:
 t Other professionals, especially speech-language pathologists
 t Interpreters
 t Teachers who have taught children who are of the same cultural background and age
 t The client‚Äôs family members
 t Community members from the same culture
Within any language, there may be many dialects. Dialects are variations in grammatical 
and phonologic rules that are adhered to by identifiable groups of people. These subgroups 
may share a common ethnicity, socioeconomic history, or geography. In the United States, 
African American English (AAE) is a commonly spoken dialect among some members of 
the black community.
A dialect is not a disorder; therefore, it is important to know the characteristics 
of a client‚Äôs dialect. Some individuals have been inappropriately placed in therapy or 
special education programs because dialectal differences were improperly diagnosed as 
language disorders.

PART I Preparatory Considerations
Normal Patterns of Second-Language Acquisition
There are normal processes that occur during the acquisition of a second language. These are 
important to understand because they can help to differentiate between a language disorder 
and a language difference. Roseberry-McKibbin (2008) identified the following six normal 
processes of second-language acquisition:
1. Interference or transfer. This occurs when communicative behaviors from the first  
language are transferred to the second language.
2. Fossilization. This occurs when specific second-language errors become ingrained even 
after the speaker has achieved a high level of second-language proficiency.
3. Interlanguage. This occurs when a speaker develops a personal linguistic system while 
attempting to produce the target language. Interlanguage is constantly changing as the 
speaker becomes more proficient in the second language.
4. Silent period. This is a period of time when a second-language learner is actively  
listening and learning but speaking little.
5. Code-switching. This occurs when a speaker unknowingly alternates between two 
languages.
6. Language loss. This is a decline in a speaker‚Äôs first-language proficiency while a second 
language is being learned.
Normal acquisition of a second language is dependent upon the continued development 
and proficiency of a speaker‚Äôs first language. For this reason, it is advantageous for multi-
lingual clients to develop and maintain proficiency in the primary language while learning 
the second language. These advantages also extend into other aspects of communication, 
including reading, writing, and cognition.
Proficient acquisition of a second language generally occurs in two stages, as de-
scribed by Cummins (1992). The first is basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS). 
It is social communication, such as language used on a playground or lunchroom, at a 
party, or during a sporting event. Social language typically occurs in a meaningful con-
text and is not cognitively demanding. The second stage is cognitive academic language 
proficiency (CALP). It is the more formal academic language required for success in 
school. CALP includes cognitively demanding forms of communication with little to 
no help from context or shared experience. According to Cummins, in ideal situations it 
takes approximately 2 years to develop BICS and 5 to 7 years to develop CALP. When 
evaluating multilingual clients, it is important to consider both social and academic 
language proficiency. A client may have strong BICS, yet struggle in school. In such a 
situation it is important to differentiate between normal academic language acquisition 
and possible learning disability.
PLANNING AND COMPLETING THE ASSESSMENT
After gaining the foundational knowledge of the client‚Äôs cultural and linguistic background, 
an appropriate assessment can be planned and executed. In most cases, formal methods of as-
sessment are not effective and in certain situations may even be detrimental to serving the best

CHAPTER 2 Multicultural Considerations 
interest of the client. A thorough assessment will include elements of traditional assessment, al-
though it may be necessary to evaluate these elements using creative and nontraditional methods.
Standardized tests are almost always inappropriate for use with culturally and linguis-
tically diverse clients (although there is a slowly expanding repertoire of standardized tests 
that are written for specific cultural groups). Standardized tests are often culturally biased, 
usually favoring the mainstream, white culture. Some test writers have attempted to ex-
pand their stimulus materials and normative sample groups to include diverse populations. 
Unfortunately, these tests are still not appropriate for most CLD clients. It is imperative 
to critically review the standardization information included with a test to determine the 
appropriateness of using the test with diverse populations. It is also inappropriate to mod-
ify a standardized test by directly translating the assessment tasks. There may not be direct 
translations for certain words and concepts, salient words and concepts from the client‚Äôs 
background that should be included may not be included, and images depicted in the test 
may be unfamiliar in the client‚Äôs native culture.
Authentic assessment is a desirable alternative to standardized testing. Authentic as-
sessment allows for the evaluation of a client‚Äôs behaviors in real-life situations and contexts. 
Assessment materials can be tailored to reflect the client‚Äôs culture. The approach is also  
dynamic. Assessments are completed over time and in different environments rather than in 
one or two sessions in a clinician‚Äôs office. Data are maintained in an assessment portfolio to 
allow for ongoing evaluation. Authentic assessment allows clinicians to determine whether 
a client‚Äôs functional communicative abilities are adequate to meet the demands of different 
communication situations.
When not fluent in the client‚Äôs primary language, it may be advantageous to learn some 
basic vocabulary and social phrases even though an interpreter will assist with a majority  
of the communication. Speaking to the client and caregivers in their primary language, even 
a small amount, may help them feel more at ease and it will demonstrate effort in relating 
to them.
If the client is school-aged, it is often helpful to interview his or her teacher as part of the 
assessment process. Specific interview questions may include:
 t How does the student interact with classmates?
 t How well is the student able to follow directions?
 t How well is the student able to communicate needs and ideas?
 t How quickly is the student able to learn new skills as compared to other classmates?
 t How well is the student able to stay on topic?
 t How disorganized or confused does the student appear to be?
 t How adept is the student at following classroom routines?
 t How well does the student perform gross and fine motor tasks?
 t What are some of the specific difficulties the student is experiencing in the 
classroom?
 t To what extent does it seem the student‚Äôs difficulties are related to limited English 
proficiency?
 t Are there differences between this student and others from a similar educational  
and cultural linguistic background?

32
PART I Preparatory Considerations
A good assessment incorporates all of the knowledge obtained thus far so that valid and 
reliable assessment data are obtained in a culturally sensitive manner. Take the following 
steps when planning and administering an evaluation:
1. Use culturally appropriate assessment materials. Use stimulus items that are familiar to 
the client, and do not use materials that might be offensive.
2. Test in the client‚Äôs dominant language and in English. Test in one language at a time.
3. Collect multiple speech-language samples. Collect samples from a variety of contexts, 
such as home, school, playground, neighborhood, and work. Tape record or, preferably, 
video record the samples. Obtain samples of the client communicating with a variety 
of people, including siblings, parents, peers, and teachers. Also sample in a variety of 
academically and cognitively demanding situations.
4. Use narrative assessment. Evaluate the client‚Äôs ability to construct and recall stories. 
Wordless storybooks may be particularly helpful.
5. Focus on the client‚Äôs ability to learn rather than focusing on what the client already knows. This 
will help determine whether the client‚Äôs current communicative patterns are due to lim-
ited experience with the language or due to an underlying language-learning disability.
6. Be prepared to modify your assessment approach as you learn more about the client‚Äôs abilities. 
Allow the process to be dynamic and flexible.
7. Consult with other professionals, such as physicians and teachers. It is often helpful to  
review medical or academic records. Some teachers may have experience working with 
students of a similar age and background and can provide information about the  
client‚Äôs behaviors in comparison to the client‚Äôs peers.
8. Consult with an interpreter. An interpreter can provide insight into the client‚Äôs speech, 
language, and cognitive behaviors in comparison to what may be considered normal 
in the culture. The interpreter can also help you synthesize information gathered from 
the client‚Äôs caregivers and anticipate the amount of cooperation and support likely to 
be given if treatment is recommended.
9. Be sensitive when meeting with clients or caregivers in an interview situation. Make every 
effort to help them feel as comfortable as possible. Keep in mind that some clients or 
caregivers may not value the (re)habilitative process. If they are uncomfortable, they 
may not return for future appointments.
MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
It is important to differentiate between a communicative disorder and a communicative  
difference. Some CLD clients may demonstrate communicative difficulties that appear to be 
disorders. It will be necessary to determine whether the client is also experiencing difficul-
ties in his or her predominant language(s). Legally and ethically, a disorder can be diagnosed 
only when the client demonstrates difficulties in all of his or her languages. If the difficulties 
are present only while speaking Standard American English (SAE), they are considered  
language differences. In most settings, clinicians cannot recommend therapy for clients who 
exhibit only communicative differences. It is acceptable, however, to provide therapy to 
clients who are electively receiving treatment for communicative differences. For example,

CHAPTER 2 Multicultural Considerations 
a client may choose to receive therapy to modify a foreign accent. These situations are usually 
limited to private practices or university clinics.
To make a diagnosis, integrate all of the collected data as if putting the pieces of a puzzle 
together. When analyzing the assessment data:
 t Examine the phonological, grammatical, semantic, and pragmatic aspects of the  
client‚Äôs language both in English and in the predominant language.
 t Determine the client‚Äôs ability to effectively use language in various environments.
 t Note the client‚Äôs level of participation and appropriateness.
 t Note whether the client is able to make requests and follow directions.
 t Note whether the client‚Äôs discourse is logical and organized.
 t Determine the client‚Äôs ability to describe events and objects.
 t Determine the client‚Äôs ability to make accurate predictions and judgments.
 t Analyze how much the client is using contextual cues to comprehend discourse.
 t Determine whether the client has difficulty learning new skills.
There are certain patterns of behavior that are more likely to be present in the case  
of a communicative disorder. When evaluating the speech-language samples, the presence of 
these behaviors may be indicators of a disorder:
 t Nonverbal aspects of language are inappropriate.
 t The client does not adequately express basic needs.
 t The client rarely initiates verbal interaction with peers.
 t When peers initiate interactions, the client responds sporadically.
 t The client replaces speech with gestures and communicates nonverbally when talking 
would be more appropriate.
 t Peers indicate that they have difficulty understanding the client.
 t The client often gives inappropriate responses.
 t The client has difficulty conveying thoughts in an organized, sequential manner that 
is understandable to listeners.
 t The client shows poor topic maintenance.
 t The client has word-finding difficulties that are caused by factors other than the  
client‚Äôs limited experience using the language.
 t The client fails to provide significant information to the listener.
 t The client has difficulty taking turns appropriately during communicative interactions.
 t The client perseverates on conversation topics.
 t The client fails to ask and answer questions appropriately.
 t The client needs to have information repeated, even when that information is easy to 
comprehend and expressed clearly.
 t The client often echoes what is heard. (adapted from Roseberry-McKibbin, 2008)
It is important to remember that a client exhibits a disorder only when speech and lan-
guage deficiencies occur in all languages the client speaks, even though the degree of severity

may vary from one language to the next. If a disorder is diagnosed, speech-language therapy 
is warranted. In some cases, the client will not qualify for therapy, but may benefit from other 
programs such as English as a Second Language (ESL), bilingual assistance, tutoring, coun-
seling, or parent and family education programs. These programs may be available through 
schools, churches, hospitals, and community organizations.
WORKING WITH INTERPRETERS
Interpreters are invaluable for providing knowledge and assistance. They also bring partic-
ular challenges. Consider the years speech-language pathologists have put into developing 
clinical expertise. When working with an interpreter clinicians effectively need to transfer 
aspects of their knowledge to the interpreter so that the information obtained is reliable and 
valid. Once accustomed to working with interpreters, clinicians will appreciate the tremen-
dous benefits and insights they provide.
There are several guidelines that should be followed when selecting an interpreter. It may 
not be possible to find this ‚Äúideal‚Äù interpreter, but do follow these principles as much as possible:
1. Select an interpreter who is proficient in English and the language of the client, in-
cluding the client‚Äôs regional dialect.
2. Select an interpreter who is experienced and trained in cross-cultural communication. 
The interpreter should understand and respect the cultural customs and subtleties of 
both parties.
3. Select an interpreter who has training and knowledge of issues relevant to speech- 
language pathology.
4. Avoid using a child as an interpreter when communicating with adults, as this could 
violate culturally based child and adult societal roles.
5. Avoid using the client‚Äôs family members or friends as interpreters, as it could violate 
family privacy, and it may preclude unbiased interpretation.
Some work environments have staff interpreters. In other settings, clinicians are respon-
sible for finding an interpreter. Consider these potential sources:
 t Local churches, synagogues, mosques, and embassies
 t Community leaders from the client‚Äôs cultural group
 t Other professionals and staff members in the same work setting
 t Other parents, if in a school setting (be sensitive to confidentiality issues)
Effective interpreters are hard to find. They should be treated with respect and appreci-
ation, and they should be financially compensated for their professional services. Langdon 
and Cheng (2002) suggest that working with an interpreter involves a three-phase process 
summarized as Briefing, Interaction, and Debriefing. The Briefing is a meeting with the in-
terpreter and the clinician only. It takes place prior to meeting with the client to accomplish 
the following goals:
 t Review the agenda and purposes of the meeting, clarify expectations, and discuss  
potentially sensitive issues.
 t Discuss technical information that will be addressed.

MULTICULTURAL
CONSIDERATIONS
CHAPTER 2 Multicultural Considerations 
 t Train the interpreter to administer any tests. Give the interpreter an opportunity to 
practice administering the test. This will allow both of you to clarify instructions and 
ensure that there is no undesirable prompting or cuing.
The Interaction takes place with all parties present and includes the following guidelines:
 t At the beginning of the meeting, introduce yourself and the interpreter to the client. Ex-
plain in simple language what you will be doing and how the interpreter will be assisting.
 t Talk to the client, not the interpreter. Maintain appropriate eye contact with the  
client even when the interpreter is speaking.
 t Use brief sentences and a normal rate of speech. Pause regularly so that the inter-
preter can convey the information.
The Debriefing is another meeting with only the interpreter and the clinician. It takes 
place after the Interaction to accomplish the following goals:
 t Discuss any difficulties that were encountered.
 t Discuss the interpreter‚Äôs impressions of the meeting and learn as much as you can 
about the client‚Äôs communication and culture through the lens of the interpreter.
 t Provide additional training, if necessary, to hone the interpreter‚Äôs skills for future 
meetings.
Clinicians and the interpreters may benefit from special training to develop the skills 
necessary to work effectively together. The integrity of the assessment may depend upon it, 
so that false diagnoses are not made.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
This chapter presented some specific considerations for the assessment of culturally and 
linguistically diverse clients. Before assessing CLD clients, clinicians need to become knowl-
edgeable about the client‚Äôs cultural values, beliefs, and communicative behaviors, and the 
client‚Äôs social and linguistic history. Assessments need to be custom-designed to meet the 
unique needs and situations of the client. Collaboration with an interpreter is often necessary.
Although assessing culturally and linguistically diverse clients is more time consuming 
because it requires assessing performance in both languages, it is important to be thorough. 
Clinicians must differentiate between a communication disorder and a communication  
difference, because only the former warrants a treatment recommendation.

Spanish Speakers
ARTICULATION CHARACTERISTICS
SAMPLE ENGLISH PATTERNS
 1.  /t, d, n/ may be dentalized (tip of tongue is placed 
against the back of the upper central incisors).
 2. Final consonants are often devoiced.
dose/doze
 3. b/v substitution
berry/very
 4.  Deaspirated stops (sounds like speaker is omitting  
the sound because it is said with little air release).
 5. ch/sh substitution
chew/shoe
 6.  d/voiced th, or z/voiced th (voiced ‚Äúth‚Äù does  
not exist in Spanish).
dis/this, zat/that
 7.  t/voiceless th (voiceless ‚Äúth‚Äù does not exist  
in Spanish).
tink/think
 8.  Schwa sound is inserted before word initial  
consonant clusters.
eskate/skate
espend/spend
 9.  Words can end in 10 different sounds: 
A, e, i o, u, l, r, n, s, d
may omit sounds
at the ends of words
10.  When words start with /h/, the /h/ is silent.
‚Äôold/hold, ‚Äôit/hit
11.  /r/ is tapped or trilled (tap /r/ might sound like  
the tap in the English word ‚Äúbutter‚Äù).
12.  There is no /dZ/ (e.g., judge) sound in Spanish; 
speakers may substitute ‚Äúy.‚Äù
Yulie/Julie
yoke/joke
13.  Spanish /s/ is produced more frontally than  
English /s/.
Some speakers may sound  
like they have frontal lisps.
14  The √± is pronounced like a ‚Äúy‚Äù (e.g., ‚Äúba√±o‚Äù 
is pronounced ‚Äúbahnyo‚Äù).
Spanish has 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u (ah, E, ee, o, u) and 
few diphthongs. Thus, Spanish speakers may produce 
the following vowel substitutions:
15. ee/I substitution
peeg/pig, leetle/little
16. E/ae, ah/ae substitutions
pet/pat, Stahn/Stan

PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
T
horough assessments involve obtaining comprehensive information about clients and 
their communicative disorders. Collect as much information as possible before the actual 
assessment session is conducted. Primary sources of preassessment information include:
 t A written case history
 t An interview with the client, parents, spouse, or other caregivers
 t Information from other professionals
The preliminary information gathered, combined with actual assessment results, will  
enable the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis and develop the most appropriate treat-
ment recommendations.
WRITTEN CASE HISTORIES
The written case history is a starting point for understanding clients and their communi-
cative problems. A case history form is typically completed by the client or a caregiver and 
reviewed by the clinician prior to the initial meeting. This enables the clinician to anticipate 
those areas that will require assessment, identify topics requiring further clarification, and 
preselect appropriate evaluation materials and procedures for use during the evaluation ses-
sion. Be aware, though, that sometimes the value of a case history form as a preassessment 
tool is limited, due to potential problems such as:
1. The respondent may not understand all the terminology on the form. As a result, inaccurate 
or incomplete information may be provided.
2. Insufficient time may be provided to complete the entire form. Realize that it can take 
considerable time to collect certain requested information, such as dates of illnesses or 
developmental history.
3. The respondent may not know, or may have only vague recall of, certain information.  
Naturally, the amount and accuracy of information provided is related to the length 
and depth of the relationship between the client and the person completing the form. 
The client‚Äôs parent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, social worker, teacher, or others will 
not all have equal knowledge of the client‚Äôs history and communicative behavior.
4. Significant time may have elapsed between the onset of the problem and the speech-language 
assessment. Respondents will usually have a greater recollection of recent events than 
events that occurred months or even years ago.
5. Other life events or circumstances may hinder the respondent‚Äôs ability to recall certain infor-
mation. For example, the parent of an only child will probably remember developmen-
tal milestones more clearly than the parent who has several children. Or the parent of 
a child with multiple medical, communicative, and academic problems will likely be 
less focused on speech and language development than the parent of a child who has 
only a communication disorder.
6. Cultural differences may interfere with accurate provision of information. The respondent 
may not understand cultural innuendos reflected in the case history queries, or by their 
own responses.
Clearly, there are potential dangers to overrelying on the information obtained in a  
case history. However, when viewed cautiously, case histories provide an excellent starting

point for understanding clients, the problems they have experienced, and the difficulties they 
are facing. No one knows a client‚Äôs situation better than the client him- or herself, or in the 
case of a child, the child‚Äôs parent or primary caregiver. The input provided is certainly an 
important piece of assessment data.
In the field of communicative disorders, a standard case history form used by all profes-
sionals does not exist. Practitioners in different settings typically develop or adapt forms that 
reflect the information they feel is needed. Form 3-1, ‚ÄúChild Case History Form,‚Äù is a case 
history form for use with children, and Form 3-2, ‚ÄúAdult Case History Form,‚Äù is designed for 
use with adults. These are basic forms that can be adapted for different practices or settings.
ALLERGY AWARENESS
Some clients may have mild to life-threatening allergies. For example, some clinicians use 
food products such as peanut butter to assess lingual range of motion. Obviously, this tech-
nique would not be appropriate for clients who are allergic to nuts. Form 3-3, ‚ÄúAllergy Alert 
Form,‚Äù is reproducible for use in the clinic. Copy the form onto a brightly colored paper so 
that it is a prominent document in the client‚Äôs file.
INFORMATION-GATHERING INTERVIEWS
Professionals in communicative disorders generally conduct three types of interviews.  
These are information-gathering, information-giving, and counseling interviews (Shipley 
& Roseberry-McKibbin, 2006). The information-gathering interview, sometimes called an 
intake interview, consists of three phases‚Äîthe opening, the body, and the closing. The basic 
content of each phase is as follows:
Opening Phase
 t Introductions
 t Describe the purpose of the meeting.
 t Indicate approximately how much time the session will take.
For example: 
‚ÄúI am Mrs. Smith, the speech pathologist who will be evaluating  
Sarah‚Äôs speech today. I‚Äôd like to begin by asking you some questions 
about her speech. Then I‚Äôll spend some time with Sarah by herself 
and get together with you again when we are finished. This should 
take about 90 minutes.‚Äù
Body of the Interview
 t Discuss the client‚Äôs history and current status in depth. Focus on communicative de-
velopment, abilities, and problems, along with other pertinent information such as the 
client‚Äôs medical, developmental, familial, social, or educational history.
 t If a written case history form has already been completed, clarify and confirm rele-
vant information during this portion of the interview.

68
PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
Closing Phase
 t Summarize the major points from the body of the interview.
 t Express your appreciation for the interviewee‚Äôs help.
 t Indicate the steps that will be taken next.
For example: 
‚ÄúThank you for all of the helpful information. Now I‚Äôd like to spend 
some time with Sarah and evaluate her speech. In about an hour we 
will get together again, and I‚Äôll share my findings with you.‚Äù
The opening and closing phases are generally brief and succinct. A majority of the in-
terview occurs in the second phase‚Äîthe body of the interview‚Äîduring which the major 
content areas are discussed. The content and length of this phase are directly influenced by 
the amount and type of information provided on the written case history, the concerns of the 
client or the caregiver, and the needs of the clinician to best understand the client and the 
problems he or she is experiencing.
Questions Common to Most Communicative Disorders
During an interview, both open-ended questions (e.g., How would you describe your speech?) 
and closed-ended questions (e.g., Which sounds are difficult?) are asked. Closed-ended ques-
tions typically elicit short, direct responses. Open-ended questions are less confining, allow-
ing the respondent to provide more general and elaborate answers. It is usually best to begin 
an interview with open-ended questions. This will help identify primary concerns that often 
require further clarification and follow-up through closed-ended questions.
The following questions are often asked about most communicative disorders during the 
body of the interview. Some or all of these questions may be used with clients, their caregiv-
ers, or both. Select those that are appropriate and integrate them into the interview. Answers 
to these questions, when combined with information from the case history, provide insight 
into the client‚Äôs communicative handicap and become a springboard for asking questions 
that are more specific to the presenting disorder.
 t Please describe the problem.
 t When did the problem begin?
 t How did it begin? Gradually? Suddenly?
 t Has the problem changed since it was first noticed? Gotten better? Gotten worse?
 t Is the problem consistent or does it vary? Are there certain circumstances that create 
fluctuations or variations?
 t How do you react or respond to the problem? Does it bother you? What do you do?
 t Where else have you been seen for the problem? What did they suggest? Did it help?
 t How have you tried to help the problem? How have others tried to help?
 t What other specialists (physician, teachers, hearing aid dispensers, etc.) have  
you seen?
 t Why did you decide to come in for an evaluation? What do you hope will result?

Questions Common to Specific Communicative Disorders
Once the general questions have been asked, more specific questions related to the present-
ing disorder can be introduced. Questions that are common to the disorders of articulation, 
language, fluency, or voice are listed here. Be aware that asking every question is not usually 
necessary. Ask the appropriate questions and adapt as needed to gain a more complete un-
derstanding of the client‚Äôs problems. When questioning a parent or caregiver about a child, 
substitute the words your child or the child‚Äôs name for you or your.

INFORMATION FROM OTHER PROFESSIONALS
Information is sometimes available from other professionals who have seen the client.  
Occasionally, such information is necessary before commencing treatment (as in the case of 
an otolaryngologic evaluation before the initiation of voice therapy), and this information 
is often helpful for understanding the disorder more thoroughly before making a diagnosis.  
There are many sources for such preassessment information, including other speech- 
language pathologists, audiologists, physicians (general or family practitioners, pediatri-
cians, otolaryngologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, etc.), dentists or orthodontists, regular 
and special educators (classroom teachers, reading specialists, etc.), school nurses, clinical

or educational psychologists, occupational or physical therapists, and rehabilitation or voca-
tional counselors. Of course, this list is not all-inclusive. Professionals from other fields may 
also be involved with a client. Information from other professionals may help identify:
 t The history or etiology of a disorder
 t Associated or concomitant medical, social, educational, and familial problems
 t Treatment histories, including the effects of treatment
 t Prognostic implications
 t Treatment options and alternatives
Be aware that information from other professionals can potentially lead to a biased view 
of a client‚Äôs condition. It is important to maintain an objective position throughout the  
assessment, relying primarily on direct observation and evaluation results.
Federal law mandates that any information obtained from, or provided to, another per-
son or agency must fall under the guidelines of the Health Insurance Portability and Ac-
countability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.1 The Privacy Rule states that it is not legal to 
request information about a client that is not reasonably necessary for the client‚Äôs care (nor 
is it appropriate to provide protected information to another provider that is not reasonably 
necessary). Although not mandated by the Privacy Rule, we also strongly recommend that 
you obtain client or caregiver authorization before contacting other professionals. A written 
permission is sometimes required and is always advisable. Licensure requirements in many 
states, ethical practice principles, and common sense dictate that students should never con-
tact an outside professional or agency without the full knowledge and permission of their 
clinic supervisor. Virtually all speech and hearing clinics have specific procedures and proto-
cols for contacting outside agencies. These are available by contacting the clinic supervisor, 
the office staff, or the clinic director.
A ‚ÄúSample Release of Information,‚Äù ‚ÄúSample Request for Information,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSample 
Referral for Medical Evaluation‚Äù are provided in Appendices 3-A, 3-B, and 3-C at the end 
of this chapter. These can be adapted for different clinical situations.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Three primary sources of obtaining information about a client were discussed in this chapter. 
These were written case histories, information-gathering interviews, and information from 
other professionals. It is best to obtain as much information as possible to aid in diagnosing 
the communicative disorder, designing a treatment program, assessing prognosis, and prepar-
ing recommendations. Important information may include various histories of the disorder, 
current levels of functioning, and previous and current reports of evaluations or treatment. The 
amount, quality, and clinical applicability of the information collected will vary. Some infor-
mation will be immensely helpful, whereas other information will be of less use. The degree of 
applicability is, of course, related to the information itself and to the clinician‚Äôs ability to use it. 
Information can sometimes be like a computer‚Äîa dust collector to one person and an indis-
pensable tool to another. Information and its use is, indeed, in the hands of the holder.

REPORTING

FINDINGS
CHAPTER 4 Reporting Assessment Findings 
T
here are two primary methods for conveying clinical findings, conclusions, and recom-
mendations: information-giving conferences and written reports. This chapter describes 
each method and provides examples that can be used and adapted for different practices.  
In many cases both information-giving conferences and written reports are used to convey 
assessment results and recommendations.
INFORMATION-GIVING CONFERENCES
Information-giving conferences are conducted with the client and the client‚Äôs caregivers. 
They are typically completed in person, but can be conducted online or over the telephone in 
some cases. Information-giving conferences usually consist of an introduction, a discussion 
of findings, and a conclusion. The basic information in each phase includes:
Introduction
 t Introduce the purpose of the meeting.
 t Indicate approximately how much time the session will take.
 t Report whether adequate information was obtained during the assessment.
 t If reporting to caregivers, describe the client‚Äôs behavior during the assessment.
For example: 
‚ÄúSarah was very cooperative and I enjoyed working with her. I was 
able to get all of the information I needed. I‚Äôd like to spend the next 
10‚Äì15 minutes sharing my results and recommendations with you. 
Here‚Äôs what I found. . . .‚Äù
Discussion
 t Discuss the major findings and conclusions from the assessment.
 t Keep your language easy to understand and jargon-free.
 t Emphasize the major points so that the listener will be able to understand and retain 
the information you present.
 t Provide a written reports that summarizes findings.
 t Use illustrations, charts, and/or diagrams as needed to help explain and clarify certain 
materials.
Conclusion
 t Summarize the major findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
 t Ask if the listener has any further comments or questions.
 t Thank the person for his or her help and interest.
 t Describe the next steps that will need to be taken (e.g., seeing the client again, 
 making an appointment with a physician, beginning treatment).

PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
For example: 
‚ÄúThank you for bringing Sarah in today. Do you have any more ques-
tions before we finish? Once again, (restate major points). . . . That‚Äôs 
why I think the next thing we should do is. . . .‚Äù
When working with children, it is important to listen carefully to the parent‚Äôs or primary 
caregiver‚Äôs responses and concerns throughout the conference. Although they are not pro-
ficient in professional issues of speech-language pathology, they certainly know their child 
better than the clinician does. Caregiver input is vital to the entire assessment and treatment 
process.
WRITING ASSESSMENT REPORTS
The precise format, style, scope, length, and degree of detail needed for a diagnostic report 
varies across settings, university programs, and even different supervisors in the same set-
ting. In some situations (e.g., individualized family service plans [IFSPs] and individualized 
education plans [IEPs]), the structure of a report is dictated by a particular clinic or agency. 
In other situations, clinicians write reports according to their own style and preferences, 
regardless of the style of the report. Most assessment or diagnostic reports have a simi-
lar format and generally present the same basic information, which includes the following 
components:
Identifying Information
 t Name
 t Date of birth/age
 t School/teacher/grade (if appropriate)
 t Address
 t Phone numbers
 t Email addresses
 t Physician(s)
 t Billing party (if appropriate)
 t Diagnostic code (if appropriate)
 t Date of evaluation
Overview/Background/Presenting Complaint/Initial Status
 t Referral source
 t Dates and locations of previous evaluations and treatment
 t Presenting complaint (unintelligible speech, disfluency, voice problem, etc.)

FINDINGS
CHAPTER 4 Reporting Assessment Findings 
Speech-Language Pathologist‚Äôs Name and Signature
Three sample reports are included in Appendix 4-A. These sample reports vary in length 
and amount of detail provided. There are many other possible styles. Consult with a super-
visor to determine specific expectations for report writing in each setting.
Although report styles do vary across clinical settings, there are some generally accepted 
standards for all reports. When preparing a written report, consider the following questions 
to check content and quality:
1. Does it contain all of the major information needed?
2. Is the information appropriately categorized? For example, is the historical information 
presented under a history heading or subheading? Is the information from language 
testing under language?
3. Is there redundancy of words, phrases, or topics?
4. Is it too wordy? Are any sentences too long?
5. Is all terminology used correctly? Are professional words used appropriately? Should 
professional terminology be used instead of lay terms?
6. Is the report written objectively?
7. Are the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù truly based on fact? Or are there facts that are actually interpretations 
or presumptions?
8. Is the focus on the major points? Are there any major points that have been omitted 
or underemphasized? Are secondary points overemphasized?
9. Does the report contain ambiguities that could be misinterpreted? Is it specific?
10. Is it written in a logical progression? Do introductory sections lead to assessment 
findings, which then lead to conclusions and recommendations?
11. Are the mechanics appropriate (spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc.)?
It may be tempting, especially for students learning to write reports, to ask peers or  family 
members to read their reports for basic readability, organization, spelling, and  grammar. Keep 
in mind that this is inappropriate for most clinical reports, as it would violate the  client‚Äôs 
confidentiality‚Äîwhether or not the outside reader knows the client‚Äîand could subject 
the student to penalties imposed by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  
(HIPAA) regulations.
WRITING IFSPs AND IEPs
The Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) and Individualized Education Plan (IEP) are 
written documents specific to children from birth through high school. They outline the 
disabilities and needs of an individual child, describe services to be provided, and empha-
size the importance of family participation in the child‚Äôs well-being. An IFSP is typically 
for infants and toddlers and should transfer somewhat seamlessly to an IEP at age three. 
Table 4-1 summarizes the major differences and similarities of IFSPs and IEPs. More de-
tailed information can be found on the website of the National Dissemination Center for 
Children with Disabilities at www.nichcy.org.

IFSPs
Early intervention is provided to infants and toddlers with a disability or developmental 
delay, and their families. Services are coordinated through regional centers, where a service 
coordinator implements the IFSP. The IFSP is developed by a team, which includes, at min-
imum, the child‚Äôs parent or parents, the service coordinator, one or more professionals who 
evaluates the child and family, and one or more professionals who provide early intervention 
services if needed. Professionals involved may be medical specialists, speech-language pa-
thologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, audiologists, nutritionists, psycholo-
gists, social workers, and others.
Although early intervention services are federally mandated, guidelines for determining 
qualifications and developing an IFSP are regulated by individual state agencies. Clinicians

will need to research specific requirements in the states in which they practice. In general, 
the following information must be included in every IFSP:
 t The child‚Äôs present levels of functioning and needs in the areas of physical, cognitive, 
social/emotional, communicative, and adaptive development
 t The parent‚Äôs or legal guardian‚Äôs concerns, priorities, and resources
 t Description of intervention services the child will receive
 t Results and outcomes expected
 t Start date, frequency, duration, and location of services to be provided 
 t Who will pay for services
 t The name of the service coordinator
 t At the end of the IFSP period (usually age 3), transitional steps out of the early inter-
vention and into another program if needed
 t Written consent for services from the parents or legal guardian
The IFSP is reviewed every 6 months and is updated at least once per year. Revisions are 
made depending on growth and progress toward stated goals. A sample IFSP is provided in 
Appendix 4-B.
IEPs
Special education services for school-age children with a disability are coordinated through local 
educational agencies, typically school districts. The IEP is the written document that describes 
the services and educational goals that will best meet the child‚Äôs individual needs. It is written 
by a team that includes the child‚Äôs parents, the child‚Äôs regular and special education teachers, 
a local educational agency (LEA) representative who disseminates services, an interpreter and 
integrator of assessment findings, other professionals with particular knowledge or expertise 
related to the child (such as a speech-language pathologist), and, when appropriate, the student 
for whom the IEP is provided. Each child‚Äôs IEP contains the following information:
 t The child‚Äôs present levels of functioning and academic achievement, particularly relat-
ing to his or her success in school
 t Measurable annual goals. Benchmarks or short-term objectives are required for those 
who take alternate assessments aligned to alternate achievement standards.
 t Description of how progress toward meeting goals will be measured and when 
 periodic progress report will be provided
 t Description of special education or other services the child will receive
 t Amount of time per school day the child will receive special education or special 
 services separate from nondisabled peers
 t If and how the child will participate in state- and district-wide standardized assess-
ments, and what modifications will be allowed; if an alternate assessment is recom-
mended, an explanation of why the specific alternate assessment is selected and why 
the child cannot participate in the regular assessment
 t Start date, duration, frequency, and location of services to be provided
 t Written consent for services from the parents or legal guardian

PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
The IEP is reviewed annually; goals and services are updated to address changing needs. 
During the transition to adulthood, which starts when the child reaches age 16, the child 
becomes a mandatory member of the IEP team. A sample IEP is provided in Appendix 
4-B. Additional samples can be found at http://specialchildren.about.com. From this home 
page, search ‚Äúsample IEPs.‚Äù This site provides sample IEPs for specific disabilities. Another 
helpful resource is the IEP Goal Bank, which is a shared collection of goals written by 
speech- language pathologists. It can be found at http://www.speakingofspeech.com/IEP_
Goal_Bank.html. 
CLINICAL CORRESPONDENCE
Sending letters or reports to other professionals is a common clinical practice. Recipients 
of clinical information may include physicians, social workers, mental health professionals, 
teachers, other school personnel, and family members. The Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule mandates that clinical information can only 
be forwarded when it is essential and for the benefit of the client.1 It is necessary to have 
a client‚Äôs written approval before forwarding confidential information to another party. A 
‚ÄúSample Release of Information Form‚Äù is included in Appendix 4-C. It can be adapted for 
different clinical environments.
Written correspondences vary in length and scope depending on the client, the find-
ings, and the recipient. Many professionals, particularly physicians, prefer a short report that 
simply gets to the point without excessive background or verbiage. Others prefer a lengthier 
report that provides a thorough description of the clinical findings. Three sample correspon-
dences are presented in Appendix 4-D. The first is brief, the second is moderately detailed, 
and the third is very detailed.
WRITING SOAP NOTES
SOAP notes are often used in medical settings for reporting client information. They are used 
to facilitate communication among professionals, such as physicians, nurses, dietitian, and 
other therapists, who are involved with the same client. SOAP notes are used on an ongoing 
basis during the evaluative and treatment phases of a client‚Äôs care and are written immediately 
after working with a client. These notes are part of the client‚Äôs legal medical records.
SOAP is an acronym for subjective, objective, assessment, plan. The basic elements of a 
SOAP note are described next, followed by an example of a SOAP note.
 t Subjective: This section contains nonmeasurable and historical information. Sum-
marize the problem from the client‚Äôs or caregiver‚Äôs point of view. Include the current 
complaint and relevant past history and recent history. Include information about the 
client‚Äôs level of concern, degree of cooperation, and overall affect.
 t Objective: This section contains measurable findings. For an initial diagnostic session, 
document the examination results. For a treatment session, document objective per-
formance measures on treatment tasks.

Learning to write (and read) SOAP notes can be challenging for beginning clinicians be-
cause of the medical abbreviations they contain. Refer to the common medical abbreviations 
provided in Table 4-2 to assist in this process. This is certainly not an exhaustive list, but it 
does define many of the most common abbreviations used by speech-language pathologists.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Once assessment information is gathered and the diagnostic evaluation completed, it is time 
to begin the process of sharing results with the client, caregivers, and other professionals. 
Results and suggestions are typically conveyed through an information-giving conference, 
a clinical assessment report, a SOAP note, and/or specific correspondence to other pro-
fessionals. In all cases, the effectiveness of the information conveyed depends on adequate 
 assessment data, knowledgeable interpretations of the data, and the use of good oral or 
written reporting skills. Acceptable presentation and dissemination of clinical findings is 
extremely important. Remember that the best assessment in the world may have little effect 
unless the information is presented effectively to others.

School Status: 2nd grade, Holt Elementary
History and Presenting Complaint
Adam, a 7-year 5-month-old male, was seen for a speech-language evaluation at the University Clinic on 
September 14, 20xx. He was accompanied by his mother.
Adam attended Holt Elementary School and received speech therapy two times per week for remediation of 
disfluent speech. Mrs. McCune reported that Adam began stuttering at approximately 3 years of age. She also 
stated that his stuttering fluctuated and increased during stressful situations. Mrs. McCune stated that her 
father also stuttered.
Adam‚Äôs medical history was unremarkable.
Assessment Findings
Speech: The Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-2 was administered to assess Adam‚Äôs production of conso-
nants in fixed positions at the word level. Adam lateralized /s/ and /z/ in all positions. He substituted /nk/ for 
/n/ in the medial and final positions. Adam was stimulable for /s/ and /z/ at the word level.
A 384-word conversational speech sample revealed similar errors. He also omitted /d/ and /t/ in the final 
position during connected speech. Adam was 100% intelligible during this sample.
Orofacial Examination: An orofacial examination was administered to assess the structural and functional 
integrity of the oral mechanism. Facial features were symmetrical. Labial and lingual strength and range of 
motion were normal during speech and nonspeech tasks. Lingual size and shape were normal. Appropriate 
velar movement was observed during productions of /a/.
Diadochokinetic syllable tasks were administered to assess rapid movements of the speech musculature. Adam 
repeated /p√∏t¬¥k¬¥/ at a rate of 4.04 repetitions per second. This was within normal limits for a child his age.

Language: The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-IV was administered to assess receptive vocabulary. A raw 
score of 92 and a standard score of 108 were obtained. Age equivalency was 8:0 and percentile rank was 70. 
The results indicated average to above-average receptive vocabulary skills.
Analysis of the conversational speech-language sample revealed appropriate expressive language skills. 
Syntactic, morphologic, and semantic structures of the language were appropriate. Adam‚Äôs average length of 
utterance was 10.9 words.
Voice: Adam exhibited a normal vocal quality. An s/z ratio of 1.0 was obtained.
Fluency: A 384-word spontaneous sample was elicited to assess Adam‚Äôs fluency rate, and he was 82% fluent 
on a word-by-word basis. Disfluencies averaged 2 seconds in duration with a range of .8 seconds to 4 seconds. 
Disfluencies included:

Adam was stimulable for fluent speech at the 3-syllable phrase level when he was required to use an easy onset 
and syllable stretching.
Hearing: A hearing screen was administered at 20 dB HTL for the frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 
and 6000 Hz. Adam responded to all sounds bilaterally.
Summary and Recommendations
Adam exhibited moderate disfluency characterized by sound interjections and sound, word, and phrase repe-
titions. He was stimulable for fluent speech, which suggests a good prognosis for improvement with therapy. 
Adam also exhibited mild articulatory errors of substitutions and additions. He was stimulable for all pho-
nemes. Expressive and receptive language abilities were age appropriate.
It was recommended that Adam receive speech therapy to train fluent speech and correct his articulation 
errors.

Email: lbreckenridge@email.com
History and Presenting Complaint
Mrs. Breckenridge, a 35-year-old female, was referred to the University Clinic by Stuart Goehring, M.D., sub-
sequent to the development of bilateral vocal nodules. The patient complained of a hoarse voice. She reported 
that the problem started about 5 months ago and had become especially problematic during the last 2 months.
At the time of the evaluation, Mrs. Breckenridge reported that she taught four periods of high school math-
ematics per day at San Joaquin High School. There were approximately 35 students per class. She stated that 
she needed to project her voice during that time.
Mrs. Breckenridge stated that she liked to sing, but did so rarely because it aggravated her voice problem. 
She reported that she did not smoke and consumed a minimal amount of alcohol (i.e., a glass of wine once 
in a while). She also stated that she did not yell excessively, use inhalants, talk in noisy environments (other 
than the classroom), or cough excessively. She did not report a history of allergies, asthma, or frequent colds. 
Caffeine intake included, at most, one or two iced teas per day.
Assessment Findings
Mrs. Breckenridge exhibited the symptoms of vocal nodules. Her voice was characterized by hoarseness, inter-
mittent breathiness, pitch breaks, and intermittent glottal fry. The symptoms were exacerbated when she was 
asked to increase her vocal intensity. Attempts to increase her loudness levels were accompanied by increased 
feelings of discomfort in the laryngeal region.
Mrs. Breckenridge‚Äôs fundamental frequency was approximately 220 Hz when sustaining ‚Äúah‚Äù for 151 seconds. 
An increase in breathiness and the occurrence of pitch breaks were noted during the last 51 seconds of these 
vocalizations.
She exhibited a low vertical focus in the use of her voice. This created a lower pitch and poor vocal projection. 
In an attempt to increase her projection, she increased her vocal effort. This type of vocal abuse is typically 
associated with the development of vocal nodules.

Appendix 4-A. continued
With instruction and modeling, Mrs. Breckenridge was able to raise her vertical focus and produce clearer, 
louder, nonhoarse, and nonbreathy vocal productions. During these stimulability tasks, Mrs. Breckenridge 
reported that she was not feeling the vocal tension and aggravation that typically accompanied her speech and 
voice use. This indicated a good prognosis for improved voice quality with therapy.
Diagnosis and Recommendations
Mrs. Breckenridge was diagnosed with moderate dysphonia secondary to vocal nodules. She was stimulable 
for improved voice quality during trial therapy tasks. She was also counseled on improved vocal hygiene. Voice 
therapy two times per week for 8 weeks was recommended. Additional therapy will be considered at the end 
of the initial treatment period.

History and Presenting Complaint
Christopher Elvi, a 38-year-old male, was evaluated at the University Clinic on May 7, 9, 14, and 16, 20xx. 
His attendant accompanied him. Mr. Elvi suffered a closed head injury as a result of a motor vehicle accident 
on July 4, 20xx. At the time of the evaluation, he was enrolled in his fifth semester of speech therapy at the 
University Clinic for remediation of mixed dysarthria and apraxia.
General Observations
Mr. Elvi was confined to a wheelchair. He had right hemiparesis and reported that before the accident, he was 
right-handed. He frequently used fingerspelling as a means of communication when speech was especially 
difficult. Fingerspelling was also used as a self-cuing strategy to elicit sound productions. He often corrected 
his own errors of articulation and language.
Mr. Elvi exhibited a significant amount of inappropriate laughter during the initial diagnostic session. He was 
able to control his outbursts and laugh more appropriately during the last two diagnostic sessions.
Orofacial Integrity
An orofacial evaluation revealed a mild drooping of the left lip corner at rest and while smiling. Mild groping 
movements were noted during lip puckering and mandibular depression. Lingual and labial strength were 
within normal limits bilaterally with slight nasal emission noted during evaluation of labial strength. The 
tongue deviated to the left upon protrusion. Degree of mandibular range, elevation, and depression were nor-
mal, with apparent jerky movements and temporomandibular joint noises noted during depression. It was also 
noted that Mr. Elvi maintained an open mouth rest posture.
Asymmetrical velopharyngeal movement was observed during the production of /A/ with deviation of the 
velum to the left. Nasality was also noted. Nasal emission was present during blowing, cheek puffing, and the 
production of /A/. A gag reflex was not elicited.
Diadochokinetic syllable rates were slow and labored with irregular timing. Mr. Elvi produced 25 productions 
of /p√∏/ in 8.44 seconds and 19 productions of /b√∏/ in 9.91 seconds. He was able to produce three repetitions 
of both /t√∏/ and /k√∏/ in 3 seconds; 1.5 repetitions of /dIp¬¥dIdIp¬¥dIdu/, 1.5 repetitions of /lIp¬¥dIlIp¬¥dIdu/, and

PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
1.25 repetitions of /gIp¬¥dIgIp¬¥dIgu/ were completed in 3-second intervals. Severe groping behavior was noted 
during complex diadochokinetic syllable tasks.
Hearing
A hearing screening revealed hearing to be within normal limits.
Voice
Mr. Elvi was required to sustain the vowel /i/ over four trials to assess velopharyngeal efficiency. He exhibited 
nasal emission and significant variation in his ability to maintain the original pitch on each trial. On the fourth 
trial, he was asked to lower his pitch and was able to control his pitch with more accuracy. However, there 
was still significant pitch variability. The average vowel duration was 8 seconds (range 5‚Äì9 seconds), which 
indicated velopharyngeal insufficiency as compared to the normal average of 15 seconds.
Mr. Elvi exhibited a high-pitched, strained-strangled voice quality with frequent nasal emission and hyper-
nasality. Other features include poor control of pitch, pitchbreaks, and audible inhalation. Mr. Elvi exhibited 
monostress during conversational speech. With training, stimulability of appropriate stress during contrastive 
stress drills was good.
A fundamental frequency indicator was used to assess Mr. Elvi‚Äôs habitual pitch and pitch range during con-
versational speech. Habitual pitch was determined to be 250 Hz, which is significantly higher than the adult-
male average of 124 Hz. His pitch range was determined to be 150‚Äì300 Hz.
Control of loudness was poor. Mr. Elvi was required to produce selected vowels with continuous phonation 
for each vowel while changing from soft to loud. He exhibited poor control of loudness and pitch during this 
task. Vowels that appeared especially difficult were /i/ and /u/, while better control was exhibited during the 
productions of /A/, /e/, and /≈ì/.
The s/z ratio of sustained productions also revealed deficits in respiration. Nasal emission was noted on all 
productions. Productions were inappropriately high in pitch and continued to rise following vocal onset. 
Audible inhalation was also noted. Mr. Elvi was able to maintain the production of /s/ for an average of  
8.86 seconds, which is significantly below the average of 20‚Äì25 seconds. The s/z ratio was 1.0. Results indi-
cated severe respiratory inefficiency and reduced vital capacity.
Repetitions of progressively more complex phrases revealed deficits in short-term memory, fluency, and res-
piration. Mr. Elvi was unable to repeat entire phrases of over seven syllables in length without cues provided 
by the clinician. He completed a maximum of three words per breath, and inhaled after almost every word 
in longer phrases (seven to nine syllables). It was also noted that he took frequent breaths in conversational 
speech, rarely completing more than three words following inhalation.
Fluency
Mr. Elvi exhibited frequent pauses, hesitations, and sound prolongations secondary to verbal apraxia and poor 
respiratory control.
Articulation
Mr. Elvi exhibited a severe articulation disorder characterized by sound omissions, substitutions, additions, 
and distortions. Intelligibility in conversational speech was approximately 92% with context known. Mr. Elvi 
exhibited severe groping behavior during all verbal speech tasks.

Appendix 4-A. continued
Mr. Elvi was stimulable for all sound errors. He exhibited notable difficulty contrasting between productions 
of voiced and voiceless phonemes when sounds were modeled in isolation by the clinician. He also exhibited 
difficulty initiating phonation when preceded by sounds without phonation (/h/ to /hA/). He was stimulable 
for articulation tasks with practice.
The Apraxia Battery for Adults was administered to assess volitional control of the limbs and the speech mus-
culature during verbal and nonverbal speech tasks. Results indicated a mild-moderate limb apraxia, a mild-
moderate oral apraxia, and a severe-profound verbal apraxia.
Language
Selected items of the Western Aphasia Battery were administered to assess auditory comprehension, repe-
tition, naming, reading, writing, and apraxia. Mr. Elvi performed well on tasks of yes/no responses, word 
recognition, object naming, sentence completion, reading, matching written word to object, spelled word 
recognition, oral spelling, and volitional oral and limb movements. He exhibited mild difficulty with 
responsive speech, word fluency, sequential commands, and repetition. On the subtest requiring oral 
reading and performing of commands, Mr. Elvi did not read all of the commands orally although he per-
formed all tasks with ease. It was assumed he did not read aloud because of his difficulty programming 
speech sounds. He responded that the task was ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù when the clinician asked why he did not read 
the commands orally. The writing subtest was the most difficult for Mr. Elvi. He struggled to write his 
first and last name and could not complete writing his address. He wrote with his left hand, which was 
not his dominant hand before the accident.
The Boston Naming Test was administered to assess Mr. Elvi‚Äôs confrontational naming skills. The following 
results were obtained:

Scores indicated the presence of moderate anomia. The number of items that required phonemic cues was 
significant.
Mr. Elvi experienced much difficulty during oral reading of sentences. A conversational speech sample was 
taken to assess Mr. Elvi‚Äôs mean length of response in connected speech. His mean length of response was 
1.8¬†words or 2.2 morphemes.
Memory
Mr. Elvi exhibited short-term and long-term memory deficits as judged by informal assessment. He  
frequently could not recall what he had done or what he had eaten for a meal during the day of evaluation. 
He also had difficulty recalling words during conversational speech and would often give up because he was 
unable to remember the appropriate word to complete his message.

Summary
Christopher Elvi was diagnosed with severe mixed dysarthria and concurrent verbal apraxia, severely reduced 
respiratory control, and moderate anomia. His speech and language were characterized by imprecise conso-
nant productions, hypernasality, audible inhalations, monostress, a harsh and strained-strangled voice quality, 
and an abnormally high-pitched voice with severely reduced laryngeal control of pitch. He took frequent 
breaths and exhibited a significant amount of groping movements during volitional speech tasks. He also 
exhibited word retrieval difficulty during conversational speech and confrontational naming tasks.
Prognosis
Prognosis for improvement of speech and language abilities with treatment is good. He was stimulable for in-
creased articulatory accuracy and for improved pitch and vocal stress during trial treatment tasks. Considering 
the extent of Mr. Elvi‚Äôs neurological impairments and the length of time that has passed since onset, prognosis 
for complete recovery with treatment is poor.
Recommended Plan of Treatment
It was recommended that Mr. Elvi continue obtaining speech and language therapy. The following treatment 
goals and objectives for a 6-month treatment period were recommended:
 1. Christopher Elvi will imitatively produce four-syllable phrases without laryngeal tension and with  
precise articulation with 90% accuracy.
Treatment will begin at the one-syllable word level. The clinician will model whispered productions of one-
syllable words and Mr. Elvi will imitate. When he is able to precisely articulate a word in a whisper with no 
laryngeal tension, voicing will be added. Productions will be mildly breathy and soft in order to maintain the 
relaxed quality. The breathiness will be gradually eliminated when the client exhibits the ability to control 
laryngeal tension in single words with 90% accuracy.
Syllabic length of modeled phrases will systematically increase by one syllable when Mr. Elvi exhibits the 
ability to imitatively articulate phrases without laryngeal tension at each preceding level with 90% accuracy.
 2. Christopher Elvi will imitatively produce four-syllable phrases in a single breath with 90% accuracy.
This goal will be addressed in conjunction with goal #1. Mr. Elvi will produce each phrase modeled by the 
clinician in a single breath. Syllabic complexity of each phrase will increase by one syllable when the 90% 
criterion is met at each preceding level.
 3. Christopher Elvi will imitatively produce four-syllable phrases at a pitch level determined to be appro-
priate by the clinician with 90% accuracy.
This goal will also be addressed in conjunction with goal #1. The clinician will require the client to lower 
his pitch to an appropriate level. Each phrase that the client imitates must be produced at this prede-
termined pitch level. A criterion of 90% must be met at each level before proceeding to the next syllabic 
phrase level.

 4. Christopher Elvi will recall five activities he participated in during each current day of treatment with 
90% accuracy in the absence of auditory or visual cues.
At the onset of each treatment session, Mr. Elvi‚Äôs attendant will provide a list of activities the client partic-
ipated in during the day. The clinician will then ask the client questions about what he did during the day. 
Phonemic and visual cues will be provided as necessary to elicit the appropriate responses.

Family‚Äôs Priorities, Concerns, Resources:
Janelle was referred to the Early Start Program by her pediatrician due to concerns about her slow communi-
cative development. She was accompanied to the clinic by both of her parents. The parents shared that she is 
not talking as much as other children her age and communicates mostly by gesturing. They reported that she 
seems to understand what is said to her. 
The family lives in a remote region of the city. The mother is able to provide transportation to a clinic if  
in-home services are not available. Medical needs are provided through People‚Äôs Healthcare.
Natural Environment
Janelle lives at home with both parents and her older brother, Timothy (age 5). The primary language spoken 
in the home is English. Both parents also speak fluent French. Her dad works full-time outside of the home. 
Her mom is home full-time. Janelle enjoys frequent visits to the library and the park with her mom and 
brother. Grandparents also live nearby and visit regularly.

Appendix 4-B. continued
Present Levels of Functioning
Janelle was evaluated on 4/21/xx at the Early Start clinic. Assessment information was gathered via observa-
tion, parent interview, record review, and administration of the Battelle Developmental Inventory, 2nd edition 
(BDI-2). 
General Health
Janelle‚Äôs overall health is good. Her mother reports no significant illnesses or injuries. Vision and hearing are 
normal. Janelle weighs 26 pounds and is 33 inches tall. 
Gross and Fine Motor
Gross and fine motor skills are within normal expectations for her age. She is able to run without falling, kick 
a ball forward, point with her index finger, scribble linear and circular patterns, and use the pads of her fingers 
to grasp a pencil. She is able to turn book pages independently, place rings on a post, and stack three cubes. 
She requires some assistance to walk up and down stairs or fasten her clothing. Her parents report that she 
sometimes has a hard time stabbing her food with a fork. 
Cognitive
Cognitive abilities are within normal expectations for her age. Janelle is an inquisitive little girl and seemed 
to enjoy exploring and manipulating test items during the assessment. She shows interest in age-appropriate 
books, points to pictures in a book, searches for missing objects, and attends to learning tasks for 5 minutes 
or more. She is able to match some colors, and can nest objects with demonstration. She seems to understand 
that she is the cause of certain events. She completes age-appropriate puzzles with assistance.
Communicative
Janelle‚Äôs receptive language skills are similar to those of an 18-month-old. She identifies family members when 
named, associates words with common objects or actions, and responds to her name when called. She can 
identify her own eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and feet when prompted. She sometimes follows one-step verbal and/
or gestural commands. She enjoys being read to, and will point to familiar items in a book when prompted.
Janelle‚Äôs expressive language skills are similar to those of a 15-month-old. She primarily communicates using 
sounds and gestures. She says the names of family members (mama, dad ) and calls her brother Timothy Im. 
She named (approximated) the following items from a picture book during the assessment: dog, duck, ball, 
baby. Her parents reported that she also says no, bye-bye, some, beebee (for blanket), and hold-you (spoken as a 
single word). She does not use two-word phrases with the exception of bye-bye Mama. During the assessment, 
Janelle babbled with long chains of unintelligible jargon-like speech. At times, she did not seem to be talking 
to anyone in the room. 
Social/Emotional
Social and emotional abilities are within normal expectations for her age. She is somewhat shy around unfa-
miliar people, but warms up quickly. She looks to her mother regularly for reassurance in unfamiliar situations. 
She enjoys having stories read to her and allows others to participate in her activities. She responds positively 
to familiar adults, and is helpful with simple household tasks, such as putting dishes in the dishwasher or 
putting her diaper in the garbage. Other than her brother, she does not have a lot of interaction with other 
children. She sometimes plays cooperatively with him, but seems to prefer to play by herself. She does imitate 
his play behaviors.

Appendix 4-B. continued
Adaptive/Self Help
Janelle‚Äôs adaptive/self-help skills are within normal expectations for her age. She is able to feed herself 
bite-size pieces of food with her fingers and sometimes uses utensils. She can drink from a cup with min-
imal spilling. She removes her clothes by herself, but needs assistance to put them on. Janelle is not yet 
potty trained but is showing an emerging awareness of bowel movements, as she sometimes sneaks behind 
a chair to soil her diaper. She puts her toys away when asked and seems to demonstrate caution and avoid  
common dangers. 
Summary 
Janelle is a delightful little girl. At the beginning of the session, she was somewhat reserved, but quickly 
warmed up to the clinician and was cooperative with assessment tasks. Parents provided developmental in-
formation for behaviors not elicited in the clinic, and also reported that the behaviors observed were typical. 
Current findings are considered an accurate reflection of her skills at this time.

PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
Appendix 4-B. continued
Concerns
John‚Äôs parents report that he started stuttering at the age of 3. They were hopeful the behavior would resolve 
on its own, but it has not. They are concerned that he is shutting down at school over embarrassment and fear 
of talking in front of other people. His teacher reports that he is a quiet boy and rarely volunteers to speak in 
the classroom or on the playground. She concurred that he may be avoiding speech situations because of the 
stuttering.
Present Levels of Performance
John is currently performing within age expectation in all academic areas. A fluency evaluation was completed 
by the speech-language pathologist. Multiple speech samples were taken, including in the school‚Äôs speech 
therapy room, in the classroom, and on the playground. His mother provided video-recorded speech sam-
ples from home. A total disfluency index of 14% was calculated. Prevalent disfluency types were part-word 
repetitions and prolongations. Both environments were similar in terms of fluency; however, it is significant 
that John spoke at home much more freely than he did at school. He did not demonstrate associated motor 
behaviors.
John‚Äôs oral mechanism was evaluated and all oral structures appeared normal. Other aspects of speech and 
language, including voice quality, receptive and expressive language, and articulation, were informally assessed 
and appeared within normal limits for his age. 
Annual Goals and Measurement
Goal 1. John will demonstrate increased control of fluency in academic and social environments at school.
Benchmark 1. John will learn and apply stuttering modification and fluency-enhancing strategies with 80% 
accuracy during moments of stuttering in structured activities. Measurement: Data collection by SLP
Benchmark 2. John will interact with his teacher and peers without perceived avoidance 5 times per day. 
Measurement: Observation by SLP and/or classroom teacher
Benchmark 3. John will demonstrate knowledge about stuttering by passing a quiz on stuttering facts.  
Measurement: Test administered by SLP

Re: Peggy Kiskaddon (DOB: 4-2-20xx)
Dear Dr. Clay:
Peggy was seen for an evaluation on January 12, 20xx. She has difficulty producing several speech sounds‚Äî
specifically r, l, th, and most consonant blends (such as br, pl, and thr).
I was able to stimulate several sounds during the session, and she could produce these new sounds in several 
words and short phrases. Peggy will be enrolled for therapy to improve her misarticulations beginning in two 
weeks. Her prognosis for improvement with therapy is good.
I will forward a complete report of my findings if it would be helpful to you. Please let me know if you would 
like a copy. Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
Linda J. Rees, M.A., CCC/SLP

Re: Eric Armstrong (DOB: 10-13-20xx)
Dear Dr. Lapsley:
Thank you for referring Eric to our clinic. His speech was evaluated on January 17, 20xx. He was cooperative 
throughout the 75-minute evaluative session and a good sample of his speech was obtained.
Eric exhibited a severe stuttering disorder. His speech was approximately 40% disfluent and included five 
different types of disfluencies. Eric and his mother confirmed that his stuttering was bothersome to both of 
them, that he avoids certain speaking situations, and that the stuttering patterns have become more prominent 
during the last 6 months.
Several techniques (particularly an easier onset of speech and a slower rate) resulted in fluent speech in the 
clinic. Eric‚Äôs and his mother‚Äôs levels of concern, their motivation, and the child‚Äôs ability to produce fluent 
speech were considered good signs for teaching him a more fluent speech pattern with therapy. He will be 
enrolled for 40-minute sessions three times per week beginning this June.
Other areas of communication (articulation, hearing, language, and voice) were normal or above normal. Thus, 
I will focus only on his ability to produce fluent speech.
A more detailed report of my findings has been written. Please contact me if this is of interest to you. I will 
send you periodic reports of Eric‚Äôs progress in treatment.
Again, thank you for referring Eric to us.

Re: Timothy Mathias
DOB: 7-25-19xx
Dear Dr. Rees,
Thank you for referring Timothy Mathias, a 73-year-old male, to our clinic. A complete dysphagia evaluation was 
completed at the Our Lady of Mercy Skilled Nursing Facility, where Mr. Mathias has been a resident for the past 
7 months. Prior to his residence at the SNF, he was residing at home with his wife (who died 10 months ago).
Nurses at the facility reported that Mr. Mathias lost 7 pounds in the last 3 weeks and has been complaining of 
difficulty chewing his food. His medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), em-
physema, and a mild stroke that occurred 3 years ago. At the time of his stroke, he experienced oral dysphagia, 
characterized by reduced oral motor strength and range of motion, primarily on the right side. At that time, he 
received speech therapy services by another speech-language pathologist affiliated with the ABC Clinic and 
made a full recovery. Until recently, he has not experienced any additional chewing or swallowing difficulties.
Assessment:
The current evaluation took place during Mr. Mathias‚Äôs afternoon meal. Mr. Mathias was seated in his wheel-
chair. He was served a hamburger, tomato soup, watermelon, pudding, and iced tea. He was in good spirits and 
was very cooperative. His cognitive status was excellent. Mr. Mathias reported that he preferred to eat in his 
room and occasionally ate while sitting up in his bed. He said that he has not been able to complete his meals 
in the past 4 to 5 weeks because of difficulty chewing his food. He said that hard foods, such as meats and 
raw vegetables, were usually most difficult for him to eat. He also reported that he often feels pressed for time 
during meals because the kitchen staff comes by to pick up the lunch trays about 30 minutes after delivering 
them, and sometimes he has not finished eating yet. When I asked him if he experiences coughing episodes 
during or immediately after meals, he said no.
A complete orofacial examination revealed adequate lingual and labial range of motion. Lingual strength was 
reduced bilaterally. Labial strength was adequate. Dentition was within normal limits for his age, with an 
upper partial plate in place. He was able to produce a dry swallow. Laryngeal elevation and timing appeared 
within normal limits. Dry cough was also within normal limits.

PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
Appendix 4-D. continued
Mr. Mathias managed puree and liquid textures without difficulty. No coughing or choking was noted.  
Laryngeal elevation and timing was good. When he attempted to eat his hamburger, I noticed that he paused 
frequently while chewing and his breathing was slightly more labored. I suggested that he take the meat out 
of the hamburger and chop it into smaller bites. Mr. Mathias reported that the smaller bites were easier for 
him to manage. I noted that he still took frequent pauses while chewing, but he was improved compared 
to the prior trial. Laryngeal elevation and timing of the swallows were within normal limits. Pocketed food 
was noted under the tongue. He was unable to clear the pocketed food on subsequent swallows. He also had  
difficulty moving a moderately sized hamburger bolus from side to side.
He said he normally eats about one-third of his meals. During the examination, he was able to eat about 
three-quarters of the meal. I did ask the kitchen staff to come back later for his tray when they arrived at the door 
to check on his progress because Mr. Mathias was not finished yet. I recommended that he do the same in the 
future. He said he feels a bit shy to do so, but he will start letting them know he would like more time to eat. I also 
recommended that he chop his food into smaller pieces, as he had done today, when he has difficulty chewing it.
Diagnosis:
Mr. Mathias presented with mild-moderate oral dysphagia characterized by reduced lingual strength and 
difficulty chewing solid food textures.
Recommendations:
t Change diet to a chopped-solids diet.
t Allow extra time for Mr. Mathias to eat his meals.
t Serve all meals while Mr. Mathias is seated upright in his wheelchair or with his bed fully raised so that his 
back and hips are at a 90¬∞ angle.
t Dysphagia therapy five times per week for 2 weeks to address the following goals.
Treatment goals:
t Increase lingual strength to within normal limits.
t Educate caregivers and Mr. Mathias about his dysphagia and train them to follow the recommendations 
listed above.
t Upgrade chopped-solids diet to regular diet upon completion of therapy.
Prognosis:
Prognosis for completion of goals is excellent considering Mr. Mathias‚Äôs motivation and cognitive status stim-
ulability for improvement, and the mild-moderate severity of the dysphagia.
A copy of this report was placed in Mr. Mathias‚Äôs medical chart and I personally reviewed my recommenda-
tions with the head nurse and the dietitian. At the end of the treatment period, I will send you an updated 
report on his progress and condition.
Thank you again for the referral. Please contact me if you would like any further information.
Sincerely,
Janelle Davis, M.A., CCC/SLP

his chapter describes methods for assessing most speech and language disorders. Not  
every procedure is necessary for each client, although a majority of assessments will  
include several, if not most, of the procedures described here.
OROFACIAL EXAMINATION
The ‚ÄúOrofacial Evaluation Form‚Äù (Form 5-1) is an important component of a complete 
assessment. Its purpose is to identify or rule out structural or functional factors that relate 
to a communicative disorder or dysphagia. The materials in this section pertain primarily 
to communicative function. Because the orofacial component of a dysphagia examination 
is more specific to chewing and swallowing, it is presented in greater detail in Chapter 15.
At minimum, the clinician will need disposable gloves, a stopwatch, a small flashlight, 
and a tongue depressor to complete an orofacial examination. A bite block (to disassociate 
tongue and jaw movements), cotton gauze (to hold the tongue in place), an applicator stick 
(to assess velopharyngeal movement), a toothette, or a mirror may also be needed. When 
evaluating young children, especially those who are reluctant to participate, a sucker may be 
used in place of a tongue depressor or toothette. Foods such as peanut butter or applesauce 
can also be strategically placed in the oral cavity to help assess lip and tongue movements. 
Keep in mind that some children have allergies to certain foods. Be sure to obtain parental 
permission before giving a food product.
Precautions should always be followed to protect all parties from possible contact with 
body fluids and infectious materials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
has mandated Universal Precautions (UP) to be followed to reduce a person‚Äôs exposure to 
diseases that are spread by blood and certain body fluids. Specific precautions that are rele-
vant to settings in which speech-language pathologists work are listed here. Always assume 
clients, and possibly other staff, are an infectious risk and use appropriate barrier practices, 
such as:

 t Abnormal color of the tongue, palate, or pharynx: A grayish color is normally associated 
with muscular paresis or paralysis. A bluish tint may result from excessive vascularity 
or bleeding. A whitish color present along the border of the hard and soft palate is 
a symptom of a submucosal cleft. An abnormally dark or a translucent color on the 
hard palate may be an indication of a palatal fistula or a cleft. Dark spots may indicate 
oral cancer.

PART II Obtaining, Interpreting, and Reporting Assessment Information
 t Abnormal height or width of the palatal arch: The shape of the palatal arch may vary 
considerably from client to client. If the arch is especially wide or high, the client may 
experience difficulties with palatal-lingual sounds. An abnormally low or narrow arch 
in the presence of a large tongue may result in consonant distortions.
 t Asymmetry of the face or palate: This is often associated with neurological impairment 
or muscle weakness.
 t Deviation of the tongue or uvula to the left or right: This may indicate neurological 
involvement. If so, the tongue may deviate to the weaker side because the weaker 
half of the tongue is unable to match the extension of the stronger half. On 
phonation, the uvula may deviate to the stronger side as the palatal muscles on 
that strong side pull the uvula farther toward the velopharyngeal opening. Facial 
asymmetry is also likely to be present. The client may exhibit concomitant apha-
sia, dysarthria, or both.
 t Enlarged tonsils: Many children have large tonsils with no adverse affect on 
speech production. In some cases, however, enlarged tonsils interfere with gen-
eral health, normal resonance, and hearing acuity (if the eustachian tubes are 
blocked). A forward carriage of the tongue may also persist, resulting in abnormal 
articulation.
 t Missing teeth: Depending on which teeth are missing, articulation may be impaired. 
It is important to determine whether the missing teeth are the primary cause of, or 
a contributor to, the communicative disorder. In most cases, especially in children, 
missing teeth do not seriously affect articulation.
 t Mouth breathing: The client may have a restricted passageway to the nasal cavity. If 
this is a persistent problem and the client also exhibits hyponasal (denasal) speech, a 
referral to a physician is warranted. Mouth breathing may also be associated with an-
terior posturing of the tongue at rest.
 t Poor intraoral pressure: Poor maintenance of air in the cheeks is a sign of labial weak-
OFTT*UJTBMTPBTJHOPGWFMPQIBSZOHFBMJOBEFRVBDZ¬âNPSFTQFDJGJDBMMZWFMPQIBSZOHFBM
insufficiency (a structural problem) or velopharyngeal incompetence (a functional 
problem). Check for nasal emission or air escaping from the lips. This client may also 
have dysarthria, hypernasality, or both.
 t Prominent rugae: This may indicate an abnormally narrow or low palate or both, or 
an abnormally large tongue in relation to the palatal areas. Pronounced rugae is also 
associated with tongue thrust.
 t Short lingual frenum: This may result in an articulation disorder. If the client 
is unable to place the tongue against the alveolar ridge or the teeth to produce 
sounds such as /t/, /d/, /n/, /l/, /tS/, and /dZ/, the frenum may need to be clipped 
by a physician.
 t Weak, asymmetrical, or absent gag reflex: This may indicate muscular weakness in the 
velopharyngeal area. Neurological impairment may be present. It is important to note, 
however, that conclusions cannot be made without considering other factors. Some 
people with normal muscular integrity do not have a gag reflex.
 t Weakness of the lips, tongue, or jaw: This is common among clients with neurological 
impairments. Aphasia, dysarthria, or both, may be present.

productions, fluency, rhythm, voicing, rate, and coordination of respiration, phonation, and 
articulation. DDK rate is measured in one of two ways: (1) counting the syllables produced 
within a predetermined number of seconds, or (2) measuring the seconds it takes to produce 
a predetermined number of syllables.  The latter is the more traditional method used.

Administration follows the second method just described.  More specifically:

SPEECH AND LANGUAGE SAMPLING
Speech-language samples are invaluable in the assessment of a client‚Äôs communicative abili-
ties and disorders. They can be the basis for determining whether a problem exists and, if so, 
identifying the client‚Äôs specific deficiencies and needs. A speech-language sample should be 
long enough to obtain a truly, representative sample of the client‚Äôs speech and language. A 
minimum of 50‚Äì100 distinct utterances is needed for a language sample, and we emphasize 
the word minimum$PMMFDUJOHoVUUFSBODFTEPFTOPUHVBSBOUFFBOBEFRVBUFTBNQMF
rather, 200 or more different utterances will provide a better data set.
To obtain a reliable and valid speech-language sample, utilize the following recom- 
mendations:
 t Strive for a long sample.
 t Establish a positive relationship before collecting a sample.
 t #FBTVOPCUSVTJWFBTQPTTJCMFNJOJNJ[FJOUFSSVQUJPOTBOEEJTUSBDUJPOT

objects or body parts.
Pictures
Pictures are often useful for eliciting a speech-language sample. They provide a known  
context, which may be helpful when assessing clients with significantly impaired intelligi-
bility. It is important to use pictures that illustrate a variety of activities. Pictures that show 
little action, depict few things to talk about, or elicit naming-only responses are of little use. 
When possible, use pictures to transition to more natural dialogue. For example, ask ‚ÄúHas 
that ever happened to you?‚Äù after the client describes a scenario. Figures 5-2 through 5-5 in 
Appendix 5-B are provided to help elicit a speech-language sample.
Narratives
An important form of a speech-language sample is a narrative, or story. Narrative production 
differs from conversational production in that the client must use certain rules of cognitive 
PSHBOJ[BUJPOBOEMBOHVBHFTFRVFODJOHUPSFMBZFWFOUTUIBUIBWFBCFHJOOJOHNJEEMFBOE

tell it back. Figures 5-6 and 5-7 in Appendix 5-B are narratives with pictures that are helpful

for narrative sampling. After reading each story, encourage the client to retell it with as much 
detail as possible. Other sources of narratives include:

READING PASSAGES
Information obtained during oral reading is valuable for making many assessment decisions 
because it allows the clinician to observe the client‚Äôs articulation, voice, fluency, and reading 
abilities. Compare oral reading results with those evoked from single-word or short-phrase 
utterances and conversational speech samples. Eight reading passages that vary in difficulty 
and age appropriateness are provided in Appendix 5-A. The first five passages are intended 
for children. All of the consonant phonemes of the English language are included in each

There are also three adult reading passages. The Grandfather and the Rainbow Passage 
have been used for clinical and research purposes in our field for many years. The third adult 
passage is a portion of the Declaration of Independence. Two of the children‚Äôs passages, The 
Amazing Spider and The Toothbrush, are also appropriate for some adults. Other sources of 
reading materials for children and adults include children‚Äôs books, grade-level readers, gen-
eral textbooks, popular magazines, newspapers, and reading apps.
EVALUATING RATE OF SPEECH
A client‚Äôs speech rate can directly affect articulation, intelligibility, voice production, and 
fluency. With some clients, obtaining periodic rates will be necessary as a measure of im-
provement (e.g., such as with fluency) or deterioration (e.g., such as intelligibility associated 
with myasthenia gravis) over time.
It is important to note that speech rates vary tremendously among normal speakers. 
This statement is reinforced by the data in Table 5-1, which presents findings from several 
speech-rate studies. Some people who use seemingly slow speech rates have excellent speech, 
whereas others with the same rate struggle with a communicative disorder. Some people 
who speak exceedingly fast may have excellent intelligibility and control of their speech, 
whereas others exhibit communicative impairments due to the rapid speech rate.

*Purcell and Runyan (1980) studied children in first through fifth grade and reported an incremental increase in average 
speech rate at each grade level.
The importance of measuring the speech rate is not to compare it with preestablished 
norms, which only indicate whether the speech rate is normal, faster than normal, or slower 
than normal. The value of assessing rate of speech is that it allows the clinician to evaluate 
its effect on the client‚Äôs communicative abilities. Consider the rate of speech and its effects 
on the articulation of sounds, intelligibility, voice production, and fluency. Will the use of 
a faster or slower rate result in better communication? Can a better speech rate be elicited?

cations of speech rate on communication.
Determining Speech Rate
To determine a client‚Äôs speech rate, record a sample of connected speech (devoid of sig-
nificant pausing) in oral reading, in conversational speech, or both. In a 60-second inter-
val, count the number of words produced and divide by 60 (or 120 for a 2-minute sample,  
180 for a 3-minute sample, etc.). For example, 200 words produced in 60 seconds is 200 words 
per minute (wpm). If there are no 60-second intervals of connected speech, use the following 
procedures to calculate the speech rate. Use a stopwatch to time the speech intervals.
1. Time the sample (e.g., 20 seconds).
2. Count the number of words produced (e.g., 62 words).
3. Divide the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of seconds in the  
sample (20 seconds in the example): 60 4 20 5 3.
4. Multiply the number of words in the sample (62 in the example) by the number in Step 3  
(3 in the example): 62 3 3 5 186. The wpm is 186.
Greater reliability in wpm calculations is possible by collecting several samples. The  
following is based on three samples:

3. The number of seconds in 3 minutes (60 seconds per minute times three samples) is 
180 seconds. Divide the number of seconds (180) by the number of seconds in the

4. Multiply the number of words in the sample (60) by the number in Step 3 (2.4):

Calculating intelligibility is necessary when considering the need for treatment, identifying 
factors that contribute to poor intelligibility, selecting treatment goals, recording baseline 
information, and monitoring the effects of treatment over time. An ‚ÄúAssessing Intelligibility 
Worksheet,‚Äù Form 5-3, is provided to help calculate intelligibility.

and Language Sampling‚Äù and ‚ÄúConversation Starters for Eliciting a Speech-Language Sample‚Äù 
earlier in this chapter for specific suggestions for collecting a sample. Audio or video recording 
the sample is helpful for analysis and future comparison. The speech-language sample used can 
be from a clinical session, from the client‚Äôs home, or from another environment (e.g., class-
room, workplace, etc.). It is best to obtain representative samples from different environments.
When analyzing the speech sample, realize that there are many factors that can nega-
tively influence intelligibility. These include:
 t The number of sound errors. Generally, the greater the number of sound errors, the 
poorer the intelligibility.
 t The type of sound errors. For example, omissions and additions sometimes result in 
poorer intelligibility than substitutions or distortions.
 t Inconsistency of errors.
 t Vowel errors.
 t The rate of speech, especially if it is excessively slow or fast.
 t Atypical prosodic characteristic of speech, such as abnormal intonation or stress.
 t The length and linguistic complexity of the words and utterances used.
 t Insufficient vocal intensity, dysphonia, hypernasality, or hyponasality.
 t Disfluencies, particularly severe disfluencies that disrupt the context.
 t The lack of gestures or other paralinguistic cues that assist understanding.
 t The testing environment (such as at home versus in the clinic).
 t The client‚Äôs anxiety about the testing situation.
 t The client‚Äôs lack of familiarity with the stimulus materials.
 t The client‚Äôs level of fatigue. Fatigue particularly affects very young children, elderly 
clients, and clients with certain neurological disorders.
 t The clinician‚Äôs ability to understand ‚Äúless intelligible‚Äù speech.

clinicians need to:
 t Identify factors that affect intelligibility.
 t View the intelligibility rating as being approximate, rather than absolute or definitive.
 t Take more than one speech-language sample, and seek varied environments when 
possible.
 t Secure a representative sample of speech. The client or the client‚Äôs caregiver can usu-
ally help you determine whether a particular sample was a typical representation of 
the client‚Äôs speech.
We also recommend that clinicians:
 t 6TFBIJHIRVBMJUZSFDPSEJOHEFWJDF
 t Avoid stimulus items that tend to elicit play rather than talk (e.g., blocks, doll houses, 
puzzles).
 t Use open-ended stimuli (e.g., ‚ÄúTell me about the car.‚Äù) rather than closed-ended 
stimuli (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat color is it?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is it used for?‚Äù).
 t Consider reporting intelligibility in ranges (e.g., 65‚Äì75%), particularly when intel-
ligibility varies. For example, a child may be 90‚Äì100% intelligible when speaking in 
utterances of one to three syllables. However, the same child may be only 50% intelli-
gible in utterances of four or more syllables.
 t Compare intelligibility on word-by-word and utterance-by-utterance bases. For some 
clients, the results will be very similar. For others, they may be considerably different. 
For example, a client whose loudness and articulation deteriorate in longer utterances 
may have many intelligible words, particularly at the beginning of individual utter-
ances. But the end of the child‚Äôs utterances may be unintelligible. A child with a prag-
matic or organizational language disorder may produce many intelligible words, but 
the connected discourse may be unintelligible. Jargon aphasic speech may also contain 
many intelligible words, but be contextually illogical.
SYLLABLE-BY-SYLLABLE STIMULUS PHRASES
Clinicians use verbal phrases as stimuli for a variety of sampling tasks. They are especially 
valuable for evaluating stimulability, assessing the maintenance of newly learned target  
behaviors in the clinical setting, and determining the client‚Äôs maximum phrase length for 
optimal speech production. Syllable-by-syllable phrases are useful for assessing many dis-

using syllable-by-syllable phrases:
 t Can the hyponasal (denasal) client maintain appropriate nasal resonance across  
increasingly longer phrases containing nasal sounds?
 t Can the hypernasal client produce the nonnasal phrases without nasality?
 t What speech rate is optimal for the client to be able to articulate all sounds correctly 
in phrases of increasing length?

Syllable-by-syllable phrases are versatile and can be used with different disorders. Artic-
ulation, rate, prosody, inflection, and intonation can all be sampled across a variety of disor-
ders using these phrase lists. The phrases in Table 5-2 can be imitated from the clinician‚Äôs 
model, read by the client, or both. Note the syllable lengths at which the desired behavior 
(e.g., fluent speech, appropriate voice, articulatory accuracy) can be maintained, as well as the 
lengths at which the desired behavior cannot be maintained. Also identify contexts that may 
be either easier or more difficult for the client. The phrase levels where breakdowns occur are 
often good starting points for treatment when therapy is initiated.

CHARTING
Charting is useful for both diagnostic and treatment activities. It provides a method of scor-
ing a client‚Äôs responses and objectively identifying the client‚Äôs communicative abilities and 
deficits. Desirable behaviors (e.g., correct sound productions, fluent speech) or undesirable 
behaviors (e.g., misarticulations, throat clearing) can be charted. This information provides 
an assessment baseline for diagnostic decisions, and demonstrates progress in treatment. 
Virtually any behavior can be charted during an evaluation. For example:
 t Correct and incorrect productions of a particular sound at a specified syllable  
or word level
 t 'SFRVFODZPGTQFDJGJDEJTGMVFODZUZQFT

 t Instances of motor behaviors associated with stuttering (e.g., facial grimaces)
 t Groping or pre-posturing behaviors in clients with apraxia
 t Specific language features (e.g., copula verbs, plural morphemes, verb phrases)
 t Word-finding problems or circumlocutions in clients with aphasia
 t Correct phonatory behaviors, such as nonhoarse vocal productions
 t Inappropriate vocal behaviors, such as throat clearing or harsh phonatory onset
Charting is also appropriate for behaviors that are important in treatment but not neces-
sarily caused by the communicative disorder. For example, record each time a child responds 
to a stimulus, stays in the chair for 30 seconds, and so forth. There are several ways to chart 
behaviors, including:
1. Note each time a preselected behavior is exhibited. For example, record each instance of 
throat clearing, each associated motor behavior, every interjection (e.g., ‚ÄúOK‚Äù or ‚Äúuh‚Äù), 
and so forth. In this method, opposite behaviors (e.g., the absence of throat clearing) 
are not recorded. The result is a count of the number of times a specified behavior  
occurred within the time interval sampled.
2. Note each instance of both correct and incorrect behaviors. Use a check (‚úì) or plus (1) for 
each desirable production, and a zero (0) or a minus (2) for every undesirable produc-
tion. For example, after 10 productions of a given sound, perhaps 7 were correct and  
3 were incorrect. This yields a percentage (70% in this case) that can be compared 
with previous or future results.
3. Note behaviors according to one of several preselected criteria. For example, when charting 
articulation, a specified sound may be omitted (O), approximated (A), or produced 
correctly (C). Percentages can then be determined for each type of response.
Various forms are available that are simple to use and appropriate for different clients. 
Two such worksheets are provided in this manual. Form 5-4, ‚ÄúCharting Worksheet I,‚Äù allows 
the clinician to chart up to 200 responses. A different target response can be entered on each 
row so progress on different stimulus items can be monitored. The worksheet is appropriate 
for charting children, adolescents, or adults.
Form 5-5, ‚ÄúCharting Worksheet II,‚Äù is designed especially for children. A total of  
100 responses can be charted on the sheet. Children enjoy receiving a star, stamp, happy face, 
or sticker in each box when they correctly produce the target behavior. It is also an enjoyable 
way to teach children to chart their own responses.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
The procedures described in this chapter are used to assess many different communicative 
disorders. Most of these procedures, or some variation of them, are included in diagnostic 
sessions. This does not mean that each procedure has to be used during every assessment. 
For example, it may not be necessary to evaluate a client‚Äôs speech rate or include a reading 
task during every evaluation.
The procedures described here, although common to most communicative disorders, do 
not focus on specific problems associated with each disorder. The information and procedures

Swimming
I like to swim when it is hot outside. It is very fun. I swim in a big pool. I 
can jump in the water. I get all wet. I can float on my back. I can float on 
my tummy too. I open my eyes under the water. I can see my brother. I 
can see my mom. They watch me. I think the water is cool. It feels good. 
I like to splash and blow bubbles and yell. After I swim, I dry off with 
my towel. My towel is yellow. It has a picture of a treasure chest on it.

Nicknames
The word nickname means ‚Äúadded name.‚Äù Nicknames are used in place 
of a person‚Äôs real name. Some nicknames are based on a person‚Äôs first 
name. For example, Matt is a nickname for Matthew. Some nicknames 
are based on what a person has done. John Chapman traveled around the 
country handing out apple seeds. Now he is known as Johnny Appleseed.
Nicknames can also be based on how a person looks. A person with

have nicknames. Some are nice nicknames. Some are not very kind.  
Many people who liked Abraham Lincoln called him Honest Abe. 
People who didn‚Äôt like him called him Old Abe.
Some people are given nicknames based on where they were born. 
For example, a person from Texas might be called Tex. If you are an 
American, you might be called a Yankee. Sometimes people are given 
special, loving nicknames. Some moms and dads call their children 
Precious or Sweetie. Moms and dads often use nicknames, like Honey 
or Dear, when they talk to each other, too. It is not unusual to have a 
nickname. Do you have one?

The Amazing Spider
A spider is an amazing animal. It can build its own home and it doesn‚Äôt 
even have to chop wood or buy a saw. Before the spider begins to build, 
it looks for the perfect spot. A spider usually likes to live in a grassy area 
where lots of insects can get caught in its web. Then the spider eats the 
insects for dinner. The spider also has to figure out which way the wind 
is blowing. The wind has to be on the spider‚Äôs back before it is able to 
make its house.
After it finds a good place to live, it is ready to spin its webs. The

the first thread as a bridge to travel from one side to the other. Then it 
continues to build its web strand by strand until its home is complete.

The Toothbrush
Did you know that the toothbrush was invented in a prison? One morn-
ing in 1770, a man in an English jail woke up with a new idea. He 
thought it would be better if he could use a brush to clean his teeth, 
rather than wipe them with a rag. At dinner he took a bone from his 
meat and kept it. Then he told the prison guard about his unusual idea. 
The guard gave him some bristles to use for the brush. The prisoner 
made holes in the bone and stuffed the bristles into the holes. It was 
a success! The prisoner was so excited about his new invention that he 
went into the toothbrush making business when he got out of jail.
For more than 200 years we have used toothbrushes similar to the 
one the prisoner invented. Toothbrushes are not made out of bones 
anymore. They come in all kinds of colors, shapes, and sizes. The next 
time you brush your teeth, think about the prisoner in England who 
invented the toothbrush.

Rainbow Passage
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act like a prism 
and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many 
beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path 
high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, 
according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no 
one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his 
friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
Throughout the centuries men have explained the rainbow in various 
ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
To the Hebrews, it was a token that there would be no more universal 
floods. The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to 
foretell war or heavy rain. The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a 
bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
Other men have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. Aristotle 
thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun‚Äôs rays by 
the rain. Since then, physicists have found that it is not reflection, but 
refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow. Many complicated

ideas about the rainbow have been formed. The difference in the rainbow 
depends considerably upon the size of the water drops, and the width 
of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. The 
actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of superposition 
of a number of bows. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green 
of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow 
band, since red and green lights when mixed form yellow. This is a very 
common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or 
no green or blue.

FIGURE 5-7. Jacob‚Äôs Day (Continued)
(a) Jacob was a young boy who had two big brothers and one big sister. He didn‚Äôt like 
being the smallest boy in the family because he never got to do things by himself. One 
day Jacob asked his mom if he could go to the store to buy a candy bar. Of course she 
said, ‚ÄúNot by yourself, Jacob.‚Äù That made Jacob very mad. Jacob said sadly, ‚ÄúOkay,  
I guess I‚Äôll go play outside.‚Äù
(b) Once Jacob got outside, he got an idea. He thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just go by myself anyway.  
I can get there and back without Mom ever knowing I was gone.‚Äù So Jacob counted 
the money in his pocket to make sure he had enough and then got on his bicycle and 
pedaled to the store as fast as he could.
(c) 
He went inside the store and looked for the candy bar aisle. ‚ÄúOh, look at all the 
choices!‚Äù he thought to himself. He was so excited! Jacob finally picked his favorite 
candy bar and stepped toward the counter.
(d) As he was paying for the candy the cashier asked, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you a little young to be here 
alone?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh no, I‚Äôm older than I look,‚Äù he said with a smile. He felt so grown up.

OVERVIEW OF ASSESSMENT
Normal speech production requires a series of coordinated actions. It requires exact place-
ment, sequencing, timing, direction, and force of the articulators. This occurs simultaneously 
with precise airstream alteration, initiation or halting of phonation, and velopharyngeal  
action. Articulation errors occur when this complex process is disrupted.
Articulatory problems result from organic (a known physical cause) or functional  
(no known physical cause issues such as) etiologies. Some organically based articulatory 
or phonological disorders are related to hearing loss, cleft lip or palate, cerebral palsy, 
ankyloglossia (tongue-tie), apraxia, or dysarthria. There are also many articulation dis-
orders of a functional etiology. Clinicians attempt to identify physical causes, particu-
larly during the oral-facial examination. However, in many cases, the precise cause of a 
speech sound disorder is unknown.
The primary purposes of an assessment of articulation and phonological processes 
include:
 t Describing the articulatory or phonological development and status of the client
 t Determining whether the individual‚Äôs speech sufficiently deviates from normal expec-
tations to warrant concern or intervention
 t Identifying factors that relate to the presence or maintenance of the speech disorder
 t Determining the direction of treatment
 t Making prognostic judgments about change with and without intervention
 t Monitoring changes in articulatory or phonological abilities and performance across 
time (Bernthal & Bankson, 2004, p. 202)

SCREENING
The purpose of a screening is to quickly identify those people who communicate within nor-
mal limits and those who may have a communicative disorder. People in the second group 
are seen or referred for a complete evaluation. A screening is not an in-depth assessment and 
should not take more than a few minutes. Screenings most commonly occur in the schools, 
where large numbers of children in the early grades are screened for communicative disorders.
An articulation or phonological processes screening test does not have to be formal. 
Many clinicians listen to the person‚Äôs speech and have him or her perform simple tasks, such 
as counting, reciting the days of the week, reading, naming objects or colors, and so on. Other 
clinicians prefer to use published tests. There are several available, including:
 t Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Dodd, Hua, Crosbie, 
Holm, & Ozanne, 2006)
 t Fluharty Preschool Speech and Language Screening Test (Fluharty-2) (Fluharty, 2000)
 t Hodson Assessment of Phonological Patterns (HAPP-3) (Hodson, 2004)
 t Phonological Screening Assessment (Stevens & Isles, 2011)
Clinicians can develop their own screening instruments by using some of the resources 
in this manual, such as the reading passages and the pictures in Chapter 5. If using pic-
ture stimuli, be sure to select pictures that will elicit the later-developing sounds. Refer to  
‚ÄúDevelopmental Norms for Phonemes and Blends‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Frequency of Occurrence of 
Consonants‚Äù in selecting appropriate target sounds when screening articulation.
FORMAL TESTS
There are many standardized tests that clinicians use to identify articulation errors. The web-
site of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) includes an extensive 
directory of assessment instruments. Some of the more widely used traditional tests include:
 t Arizona Articulation Proficiency Scale (Arizona-3) (Fudala, 2000)
 t Clinical Assessment of Articulation and Phonology (CAAP) (Secord, Donohue, & 
 Johnson, 2002)
 t Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Dodd, Hua, Crosbie, 
Holm, & Ozanne, 2006)
 t Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation 2 (Goldman & Fristoe, 2000)
These tests, and others like them, assess sounds in the initial, medial, and final positions 
(e.g., the /l/ in light, balloon, and ball ), allowing the clinician to identify the number and 
types of errors.
Articulation tests are used to identify a client‚Äôs articulation errors in a relatively quick 
and systematic fashion. They are popular and useful assessment tools. However, they do have 
limitations. For example, consider these drawbacks:
 t These tests usually elicit phonemes in only one phonetic context within a preselected 
word. Even if the client produces the sound correctly, there may be other contexts and 
words in which the client cannot produce the target sound correctly. Or, an error may 
be elicited that is not reflective of a general pattern in other contexts.

SPEECH SOUND 
DISORDERS
CHAPTER 6 Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders 
 t Most articulation tests elicit phonemes at the word level for the assessment of initial, 
medial, and final position productions. However, conversational speech is made up of 
complex, coarticulated movements in which discrete initial, medial, and final sounds 
may not occur. Thus, sound productions in single words may differ from those in 
spontaneous speech.
 t Some articulation tests examine only consonants, yet accurately produced vowels are 
also important for well-developed speech.
 t These tests provide only an inventory of the sounds sampled. They do not yield  
certain diagnostic information, such as whether a particular sound error might be  
developmentally appropriate.
 t The reliability of findings may be questionable with disorders that result in variable 
sound productions. For example, a key feature of childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is 
inconsistently produced sounds. Many clients with CAS produce a sound or word cor-
rectly one time and incorrectly the next. With a variable disorder, the clinician who sam-
ples a given word once or only a few times may draw conclusions that are not accurate.
When evaluating clients with moderate to severe articulation disorders, tests of phono-
logical processes may prove more diagnostically valuable than traditional articulation tests. 
Phonological processes are described later in this chapter. Some of the tests commonly used 
to examine these processes include:
 t Assessment Link Between Phonology and Articulation‚ÄîRevised (ALPHA-R) (Lowe, 2000*)
 t Clinical Assessment of Articulation and Phonology (CAAP) (Secord & Donohue, 2002)
 t Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP-2) (Wagner, Torgesen, & 
Rashotte, 2009)
 t Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Dodd, Hua, Crosbie, 
Holm, & Ozanne, 2006)
 t Hodson Assessment of Phonological Patterns (HAPP-3) (Hodson, 2004)
 t Kahn-Lewis Phonological Analysis‚Äî2nd ed. (KLPA-2) (Khan & Lewis, 2003)
 t Smit-Hand Articulation and Phonology Evaluation (SHAPE) (Smit & Hand, 1997).
Electronic assessment tools are helpful for automatically generating a phonemic and 
phonologic profile. Some tools allow the clinician to select from different assessment levels, 
and results can be stored in a client‚Äôs digital file for future retrieval. Keep in mind that not 
all electronic resources are standardized and/or norm-based, and results must be considered 
with this limitation in mind. Some electronic assessment tools are:
 t ‚ÄúArticulation Test Center‚Äù (app by Little Bee Speech)
 t ‚ÄúSunny Articulation and Phonology Test‚Äù (app by Smarty Ears)
 t Computerized Articulation and Phonology Evaluation System (CAPES) (Masterson & 
Bernhardt, 2001)
 t Computerized Profiling for Phonology (PROPHET) (Long, Fey, & Channell, 2006)
 t Hodson Computerized Analysis of Phonological Patterns (HCAPP) (Hodson, 2003)

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
IDENTIFYING SOUND ERRORS FROM A SPEECH SAMPLE
Procedures for collecting a speech-language sample were described in Chapter 5. The speech 
sample is especially important for accurately diagnosing disorders of speech sound produc-
tion. After obtaining one or more representative samples of the client‚Äôs speech, analyze the 
sample with a focus on the following behaviors:
 t Number of errors
 t Error types
 t Consistency of errors between the speech sample and the articulation test, within the 
same speech sample, and between different speech samples
 t Correctly produced sounds
 t Intelligibility
 t Speech rate
 t Prosody
Most articulation tests allow for easy identification of sound errors. This is a more difficult 
task with speech samples because they may not elicit all of the phonetic sounds unless the 
sample is elicited in a systematic manner. To complete a thorough diagnostic evaluation, the 
clinician will need to compare errors made during the articulation test to those errors made 
during connected speech. For some sounds, there may be multiple error types. It is also nec-
essary to inventory correctly produced sounds. Form 6-1, ‚ÄúComparison of Sound Errors from 
an Articulation Test and Connected Speech,‚Äù will help to identify the errors produced during 
the speech sample and then compare the results with errors identified on the articulation test. 
Typically, more sound errors will be found during the connected speech sample. Also note that 
initial, medial, and final sound positions are not as definitive in connected speech.
STIMULABILITY
Stimulability refers to a client‚Äôs ability to produce a correct (or improved) production of an 
erred sound. The client attempts to imitate the clinician‚Äôs correct production, often after 
receiving specific instructions regarding the articulatory placement or manner of sound pro-
duction. For example, the clinician may hold the client‚Äôs lips together to form a /p/, or touch 
the client‚Äôs hard palate with a tongue depressor to show tongue placement for the production 
of /t/. In some cases, a mirror is helpful for eliciting the target sound.
The assessment of stimulability provides important prognostic information. If the clini-
cian is able to stimulate a target behavior at the sound level or word level during the diag-
nostic session, it is more likely that the desired behavior will be trainable at more complex 
levels. Those behaviors that are most easily stimulated provide excellent starting points in 
therapy because they often lead to treatment success quicker than other, less stimulable 
behaviors.
The ability to stimulate erred sounds is based on a good working knowledge of phonetics. 
The clinician must know what needs to be changed in order to improve the production. It is 
also important to realize that, in some cases, there is more than one way to correctly articu-
late a sound. For example, a ‚Äútextbook description‚Äù of /t/ will state that it is a lingua-alveolar

SPEECH SOUND 
DISORDERS
CHAPTER 6 Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders 
sound produced by tapping the tongue on the hard palate. However, some people produce a 
good /t/ by tapping the tongue on the front teeth.
Another key to stimulability is visually observing the client‚Äôs erred productions. Even 
though not all sounds are visible, many are. Beginning clinicians tend to listen to speech 
more than watch speech, but seeing an error can help identify what needs to change in order 
to produce a better sound.
There are resources that provide helpful instructions for stimulating each phoneme. 
These are some that we recommend:
 t Applied Phonetics: The Sounds of American English (3rd ed.) (Edwards, 2003)
 t Manual of Articulation and Phonological Disorders (2nd ed.) (Bleile, 2004)
 t Eliciting Sounds: Techniques and Strategies for Clinicians (2nd ed.) (Secord, Boyce,  
Donohue, Fox, & Shine, 2007)
Once a sound is stimulated at the sound or syllable level, sample it at the word and  
phrase levels. The words and phrases in Appendix 6-A are provided for this purpose. The 
‚ÄúSyllable-by-Syllable Stimulus Phrases‚Äù in Chapter 5 can also be used to assess stimulability 
in phrases of increasing length (Secord, Boyce, Donohue, Fox, & Shine, 2007).
Form 6-2, ‚ÄúSounds That Are Stimulable,‚Äù can be used to summarize stimulability as-
sessment findings. In many cases, the form will help identify patterns of stimulable sounds  
at different levels, providing potential starting points for therapy. The clinician may also  
get a clearer picture of specific error types that may be more amenable to earlier treatment 
(e.g., bilabials may be more stimulable than velars).
DEVELOPMENTAL NORMS FOR PHONEMES AND BLENDS
Clinicians often use normative data to determine whether or not a child is developing within 
normal expectations. Although norms are helpful, consider these limitations of overreliance 
on developmental norms:
 t A norm is only an average age at which a behavior occurs. It refers, therefore, to a  
hypothetical child who does not, and never did, exist.
 t True norms are collected from and apply to a normal, randomly selected sample. 
These exact representative samples rarely exist in the real world.
 t Different norms are rarely in agreement with each other. The differences are caused 
by many factors, including when the study was conducted, where the study was con-
ducted, the size and characteristics of the sample, the research design followed, and 
the mastery criteria used.
Despite these limitations, norms are useful for estimating approximately how well a child‚Äôs 
sounds are developing. In current practice, the more recent studies presented in Table 6-2 
are referred to most frequently. Generally, the later studies indicate an earlier development 
of consonants than the earlier studies from the 1930s. The following notes are offered as a 
general explanation of the material in Table 6-2:
 t Wellman, Case, Mengurt, and Bradbury‚Äôs (1931) study represents the earliest age at 
which 75% of the 204 children tested (ages 2 to 6 years) correctly produced the con-
sonant phoneme in the initial, medial, and final positions.

SPEECH SOUND 
DISORDERS
CHAPTER 6 Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders 
The data from the normative studies in Table 6-2 resulted in a specific age of develop-
ment, but these ages do not reflect normal and acceptable developmental variability. Sander 
(1972) reinterpreted the data collected by Templin (1957) and Wellman et al. (1931) and 
compiled the age ranges presented in Figure 6-1. It is important to view ranges, because 
they provide useful information about developmental variations. For example, compare 
Table 6-2 with Figure 6-1. In Table 6-2, Sander suggests that /p/ develops before age 2.  
However, in Figure 6-1, you can see he also found that /p/ in normal development may con-
tinue to develop until age 3.
Keep in mind that normative data only tell part of the story, as certain errors are devel-
opmentally appropriate whereas others are not. For example, consider two different errors 
involving /s/. A substitution of /t/ for /s/ is acceptable at age 2 but not at age 4, but a /T/ 
for /s/ at age 4 may not be a concern. Remember to interpret normative data for individual 
sounds relative to their overall patterns.
Normative data for the development of consonant clusters is presented in Table 6-3. 
The information is based on research by Smit, Hand, Frelinger, Bernthal, and Byrd (1990). 
The data reflect the ages at which at least 50% (first column) or 75% (second column) of 
the children in the sample group accurately produced each consonant cluster in the initial 
position of words.

FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF CONSONANTS
Table 6-4 contains the percentages of occurrence of intended American English consonants 
in continuous speech. The information is from Shriberg and Kwiatkowski (1983), who sum-
marized several studies of the frequency of consonant productions in natural speech. The 
studies they evaluated included data from children with normal and delayed speech devel-
opment, as well as adults with normal speech.
A cumulative percentage of consonant occurrence is provided in the right-hand col-
umn of the table. Note that the sounds /n/, /t/, /s/, /r/, /d/, and /m/ cumulatively represent

DESCRIPTIVE FEATURES OF PHONEMES
Phonemes of the English language can be grouped and separated according to similar and 
dissimilar features. Sounds are most commonly described according to place of articulation, 
manner of articulation, and voicing, as shown in Table 6-5. When completing an assessment, 
take note of whether phoneme errors tend to occur within specific categories (e.g., errors of 
fricatives, errors of alveolars, errors of voicing).

SPEECH SOUND 
DISORDERS
CHAPTER 6 Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders 
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF CONSONANTS
Individual sounds consist of unique and distinct features that, make each sound differ-
ent from all other sounds. For example, /f/ and /v/ are two sounds that share four fea-
tures (consonantal, anterior, continuant, strident) but differ by one feature (voicing), which 
makes them separate sounds. Clinicians often use distinctive features to identify error 
patterns. Once the patterns are identified, therapy focuses on training the features that 
will improve speech productions. The advantage of the distinctive features approach is its 
ability to target one or more specific features that will help improve more than one sound 
at the same time.
The following examples show several distinctive feature patterns:
Example One:
/t/ for /k/ 
(tup for cup)
/d/ for /g/ 
(dumb for gum)
/n/ for /N/ 
(lawn for long)
The erred feature in this example is an anterior placement. Sounds are produced in front 
of the mouth instead of the back.
Example Two:
/d/ for /n/ 
(dice for nice)
/b/ for /m/ 
(bake for make)
/g/ for /N/ 
(lug for lung)
The erred pattern involves nasality. Nonnasal sounds are substituted for nasal sounds.
Example Three:
/w/ for /f/ 
(wine for fine)
/l/ for /v/ 
(lase for vase)
/t/ for /s/ 
(toap for soap)
omissions of /s/, /S/, /tS/, /Z/, and /dZ/
Although these errors do not initially appear to be related, the missing distinctive feature 
in all the sounds is stridency.
Table 6-6 is based on Chomsky and Halle‚Äôs (1968, 1991) listing of the distinctive  
features of English consonants. Definitions of each feature are also provided.

Round: Produced by rounding the lips.
PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES
As stated previously, distinctive features refer to the characteristic features of individual 
sounds. Phonological processes, on the other hand, apply to larger segments that include 
individual sounds. Phonological processes describe what children do in the normal develop-
mental process of speech to simplify standard adult productions. When a child uses many 
different processes or uses processes that are not commonly present during speech acquisi-
tion, intelligibility may be impaired.
The advantage of using a phonological processes approach when analyzing articulation 
is that the clinician can identify error patterns and then target those patterns to remediate 
more than one sound at a time. For example, if a child exhibits a final consonant deletion pat-
tern, the clinician may choose to target final consonants in general rather than focus on only 
a few sounds in the final position. Many commonly used tests for evaluating phonological 
processes are listed earlier in this chapter under the heading ‚ÄúFormal Tests.‚Äù

by age 8. Table 6-7 presents developmental norms for phonological processes in normally 
developing children. Keep in mind that some children may be diagnosed with a phonolog-
ical disorder even if certain phonological processes identified are considered within normal 
expectations for their age. This can occur when many processes are present and intelligibility 
is significantly impaired.
Form 6-3, ‚ÄúPhonological Processes Worksheet,‚Äù is a worksheet for identifying phono-
logical processes elicited during connected speech or on a formal test. An inventory of pho-
nological processes is most valuable when working with children who have poor speech 
intelligibility due to multiple articulation errors. For children with only a few errors, use

CHILDHOOD APRAXIA OF SPEECH
Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a motor speech disorder. A child with CAS has dif-
ficulty sequencing sounds, syllables, and words for speech even though there is no muscle 
weakness, paralysis, or other physical limitation. Its etiology is usually unknown, although in

some cases it is secondary to a genetic disorder or acquired from a stroke or brain injury. It 
is similar to acquired apraxia of speech (AOS; presented in Chapter 14) in that oral-motor 
programming for speech is impaired. What makes CAS different from AOS, however, is 
the significant negative impact it has on linguistic and phonologic development. It is not a 
disorder a child will outgrow, and severe cases can have a potentially devastating impact on 
oral communication. 
Published tests for the diagnosis of apraxia of speech include:
 t Apraxia Battery for Adults (ABA-2) (Dabul, 2000)
 t Quick Assessment for Apraxia of Speech (Tanner & Culbertson, 1999)
Differential diagnosis is challenging because behaviors associated with CAS are also 
associated with other communicative disorders. These may include dysarthria, speech delay, 
fluency disorder, expressive and receptive language impairment, literacy disorder, and pho-
nological impairment. This is complicated by the fact that CAS often co-occurs with one or 
more of these other communicative disorders. Behaviors associated with CAS vary from one 
child to another, and also vary within the same child as the child matures.
Table 6-8 presents behaviors and characteristics that are associated with CAS. It is rele-
vant to note that not all professionals are in agreement about symptoms of CAS, and some 
behaviors are considered characteristic even though they have not been validated through 
controlled studies.
Although currently there are no distinguishing features that completely differentiate 
CAS from other childhood speech disorders, there are behaviors that are especially char-
acteristic of CAS. An American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) ad hoc 
committee identified the following three segmental and suprasegmental features of CAS:
1. Inconsistent errors on consonants and vowels in repeated productions of syllables  
or words
2. Lengthened and disrupted coarticulatory transitions between sounds and syllables
3. Inappropriate prosody, especially in the realization of lexical or phrasal stress  
(ASHA, 2007a)
The same committee stressed that clinicians should focus on differentiating CAS from 
other similar disorders during an assessment. Evaluate all aspects of speech that may be  
affected, with particular emphasis on:
 t Automatic versus volitional actions
 t Single postures versus sequences of postures
 t Simple contexts versus more complex or novel contexts
 t Repetitions of the same stimuli versus repetitions of varying stimuli

CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Various assessment materials and procedures were presented in this chapter. These ranged 
from articulation screening to administration of formal articulation tests, and from obtain-
ing speech samples to assessing stimulability. The resource materials included normative 
data, distinctive features, and phonological processes. Some of the resources in Chapter 5 are 
also useful for assessing disorders of articulation and phonological processes.

  Date: 
Examiner‚Äôs Name: 
Instructions: Compare speech errors identified during an articulation test and connected speech. Here are 
recommended ways to mark errors:
Omission:  
use a dash (‚Äî) or write omit
Distortion:  
 use diacritics; describe the error; or use a D or write dist and indicate severity with  
1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). For example, D3 is a severe distortion.
Substitution:  
transcribe the error
Addition:  
transcribe the error
Stimulable:  
 use a check (!) or a plus (1); if the error is improved but not perfectly correct,  
mark an upward arrow (‚Üë) or describe the nature of the improvement.
Not Stimulable:  use NS (not stimulable) or zero (0)
Then summarize your findings to identify error patterns.

The words and sentences provided in Table 6-9 are designed for assessing stimulability of misarticulated 
phonemes. Three words and sentences are provided for each phoneme in the initial, medial, and final posi-
tions. For each sound, the single words contain a front vowel, a central vowel, and a back vowel for assessing 
consonant productions in different contexts. The normative age data for individual phonemes in the left-hand 
column are from Prather, Hedrick, and Kern (1975), and reflect the age at which 75% of the children tested 
correctly produced the targeted sound in the initial and final positions. Initial position blends are included, 
following the singletons. The normative age data for blends are from Smit, Hand, Frelinger, Bernthal, and 
Byrd (1990), and reflect the age at which 75% of the children tested correctly produced the targeted sound in 
the initial position of words. (Refer to the ‚ÄúDevelopmental Norms for Phonemes and Blends‚Äù in the chapter 
for more information on the use of norms.) Three words (each containing a front, central, and back vowel 
when possible) and a short phrase or sentence are provided for each blend.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
Assessment Approaches
Even though there are a multitude of resources for assessment, language pathology can 
sometimes be one of the most challenging disorders to evaluate. This is not surprising con-
sidering how varied and complex language really is. Consider these complicating factors:
 t The development of language is influenced by other aspects of development such as 
cognition, motor development, and social development. Clinical conditions such as 
mental retardation, hearing impairment, various genetic syndromes, and autism also 
affect language.
 t The components of language (i.e., pragmatic, semantic, syntactic, morphologic, and 
phonologic) do not occur in isolation; they are integrated with one another. In addi-
tion, assessment of these individual components does not provide information about 
a client‚Äôs use of language holistically.
 t Expectations of language performance change across time. What is normal at age 1 
may be deviant at age 3.
 t Speakers of any given language are not a homogeneous group. Individual experiences 
and abilities result in a broad definition of normal language.
 t Because of individual variability, there is no ‚Äúbest‚Äù approach for the assessment of lan-
guage with all clients.
Owens (2013) described two approaches for assessing language: the psychometric  
approach and the descriptive approach. The psychometric approach is a traditional language 
assessment approach with an emphasis on ranking individuals according to norms. Perfor-
mance is summarized by using percentile ranks and standard scores. The use of standardized, 
norm-referenced tests is emphasized.
There are certain advantages of using a psychometric approach for the assessment of 
language. A broad content area is usually assessed with a high degree of objectivity, reliability, 
and validity. Norm-referenced tests also help determine whether a problem exists and help 
identify specific problem areas. There are also limitations of the psychometric approach. 
Norm-referenced tests often do not adequately assess the complex, multidimensional aspects 
of language, nor are they appropriate for many of the clients speech-language pathologists 
typically evaluate (i.e., profiles of the clients do not match the profiles of the sample group 
on which the norms are based).
The second approach, the descriptive approach, is an authentic assessment method 
with a focus on describing behaviors and comparing past performance to current perfor-
mance. Spontaneous speech-language sampling and observation in naturalistic contexts is 
emphasized. Language is assessed in all of its richness and complexity. This approach allows 
clinicians to determine whether (and if yes, how) the presenting problems are affecting the 
client‚Äôs day-to-day communicative interactions. This approach also has its limitations. Reli-
ability and validity of the findings are dependent upon the level of expertise of the clinician 
and how representative the language samples obtained are. The speech-language pathologist 
must be truly expert in understanding and evaluating the complexities of language.
An integrated approach that combines aspects of both the psychometric and the de-
scriptive approaches is the recommended assessment approach. The assessment is typically a 
work in progress, as findings in the earlier stages of the assessment inform later assessment 
choices. For example, the case history, caregiver interview responses, and direct observation 
of the child will likely guide the clinician toward certain formal tests that will yield the most

beneficial objective data. Findings from formal assessments may guide the clinician to probe 
for and analyze specific aspects of language during language sampling.
Components of Language
When completing a language evaluation, it is important to understand the basic elements of 
language. The five components of language are defined below. Four of the five components 
are described in more detail later in this chapter. The phonologic component is described in 
greater detail in Chapter 6.
1. Semantic: refers to the meaning of language
2. Syntactic: refers to the rules of grammar
3. Morphologic: refers to units of meaning
a. Free morphemes: units that can stand alone (most words)
b. Bound morphemes: units that cannot stand alone; they must be attached to a free 
morpheme (e.g., pre-, -ing)
4. Pragmatic: refers to the social aspects of language (e.g., eye contact, turn-taking)
5. Phonologic: refers to speech sounds, sound patterns, and rules of sound organization
Cognition and Language
Cognition is not a component of language; however, cognition is intrinsically related to 
language and is worthy of mention in this chapter. A child‚Äôs cognitive abilities affect lan-
guage in all aspects. Mental processes for learning, remembering, and using knowledge 
are essential for normal language acquisition and use. During a language assessment, it 
is helpful to take note of the child‚Äôs cognitive abilities, including his or her attention and 
focus, reasoning ability, perception, memory, organization of self and thoughts, and over-
all executive function. If concerns arise, further cognitive assessment may be warranted. 
Chapter 13, Assessment of Neurocognitive Disorders, provides more information about 
assessment of cognition.
Language Disorder Categories
There are several diagnostic categories of language disorders. In most cases, deficient lan-
guage is not the only clinically significant feature of these conditions. We mention them here 
to provide a framework for understanding language disorders in a broad sense. This chapter 
is primarily concerned with the assessment and diagnosis of the first one, specific language 
impairment, although chapter materials can be modified to aid in the assessment of several 
of the other categories as well.
Specific language impairment (SLI)
A seemingly pure language impairment with no obvious cause or co-occurring condition. 
Children with SLI follow the same general sequence of language acquisition as normally 
developing children, although at an impaired rate.
Language-learning disability (LLD)
A condition characterized by difficulties in acquiring and using skills for listening, speaking, 
reading, writing, reasoning, or mathematics. It is believed to be caused by central nervous 
system dysfunction.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD)
A disorder characterized by impairment in communication and social skills and stereotyped 
and restricted behavioral patterns. The assessment of clients with an autism spectrum disor-
der is discussed in Chapter 9.
Brain injury
A neurological condition that occurs after some type of insult to the brain, such as traumatic 
brain injury, stroke, tumor, convulsive disorder, infection, or congenital malformation. Brain 
injury as a result of traumatic brain injury or stroke is discussed in Chapter 13.
Mental retardation (MR)
A condition characterized by intellectual function that is significantly below normal. It usu-
ally is caused by a biological medical condition or syndrome.
Deafness
A state of having minimal to no hearing. Causes may be biological or environmental. The 
impact of deafness on language is profound.
SCREENING
In some settings, screening for language disorders may seem like an overwhelming task. All 
of the components of language need to be screened in both receptive and expressive contexts 
quickly and efficiently. The purpose of a screen is to determine whether an in-depth assess-
ment is necessary. Various tests and scales are commercially available for screening purposes. 
These include:
 t Adolescent Language Screening Test (Morgan & Guildford, 1984)
 t Boehm Test of Basic Concepts (Boehm, 2001)
 t Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Screening Test (Semel,  
Wiig, & Secord, 2004)
 t Early Language Milestone Scale, 2nd ed. (ELM Scale-2) (Coplan, 1993)
 t Fluharty Preschool Speech and Language Screening Test (2nd ed.) (Fluharty, 2000)
 t Joliet 3-Minute Preschool Speech and Language Screen (Kinzler, 1993)
 t Joliet 3-Minute Speech and Language Screen-Revised (Kinzler & Johnson, 1993)
 t Kindergarten Language Screening Test (Gauthier & Madison, 1998)
When selecting an appropriate screening tool, consider variables such as the amount of 
time necessary for administration and the areas of language that are sampled. Many clini-
cians develop their own informal screening instruments. Several items in this resource (such 
as Forms 7-3, ‚ÄúAssessment of Language Development‚Äù; 7-5, ‚ÄúChecklist for an Informal  
Assessment of Language‚Äù; 7-6, ‚ÄúWorksheet for Recording a Language Sample‚Äù; 7-9, ‚ÄúAs-
sessment of Semantic Skills‚Äù and 7-10, ‚ÄúAssessment of Syntactic Skills‚Äù) can be adapted for 
screening purposes.

ASSESSMENT OF EARLY LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT
Babies are born with limited ability to communicate. By the time they reach their fifth 
birthdays, normally developing children achieve nearly adult-like communication skills. 
Their language growth is dramatic from one year to the next. Table 7-1 provides a gen-
eral summary of the major milestones of language development in the first five years. 
For a more detailed listing, which also includes speech and motor development, see 
content in Chapter 18.
The first three years of life are extremely important for setting the foundation for later 
development; therefore intervention for very young children who are struggling is critical. 
Research has shown that language problems in the early years may persist well into the 
school years and will likely affect academic performance in all areas.
Traditional methods of assessment are not feasible with the youngest clients. Most toddlers 
will not attend to the static formal tests that are commonly used with older children. Instead, 
information gathered on a case history form, questionnaire, and through parent interview are

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
primary sources of data. Interaction with the client is play-based, with the clinician manipu-
lating the play situation just enough to test desired behaviors. The clinician‚Äôs goal is to ask the 
right questions, observe the right behaviors, and administer the right tests in order to obtain 
valid findings that are an accurate reflection of the child‚Äôs true abilities and disabilities. Testing 
in the child‚Äôs natural environment using familiar toys, people, and routines is ideal.
The young child‚Äôs parents are active participants in the assessment process. They are the 
best source of information about a child‚Äôs history and present skill level. They can answer 
questions about what the child can and cannot do, describe the child‚Äôs daily routine, report 
about the client‚Äôs behavior in other environments and with other people, and validate or 
clarify the clinician‚Äôs observations. It is helpful to ask the parent if behaviors observed during 
the session are typical or atypical. Parents can often interpret what they believe their child 
is trying to communicate. Parents can also be called on to administer test probes when the 
child is reluctant or shy. For example, the clinician might ask the parent to see if the child can 
identify certain objects in a picture book while parent and child read together.
An important consideration is parent‚Äìchild interaction. Observing the child with a parent 
or very familiar caregiver can often provide the best and most representative language and 
behavioral samples. It is also enlightening to note the parent‚Äôs communication style. It may be-
come clear that a child is not developing within normal expectations because the parent model 
is deficient. Form 7-1,‚ÄùWorksheet for Analyzing Child‚ÄìCaregiver Interactions‚Äù is useful for 
analyzing the communicative behaviors of the child with the parent or other caregiver.
Because normal expectations vary significantly as babies mature to toddlers and then pre-
schoolers, we have grouped the assessment for early intervention into three broad categories. 
When evaluating a nonverbal or preverbal child, note these communicative behaviors:
 t Does the child use gestures or signs to communicate?
 t Are there nonspeech vocalizations?
 t Are there meaningful vocalizations?
 t How does the child respond to verbal stimulation?
 t Does the child use eye contact?
 t Does the child use objects and toys appropriately?
 t Can the child imitate words?
 t Does the child attempt to spontaneously produce words?
 t How does the child communicate intent?
 t Does the child follow simple commands?
 t Can the child point to named objects in a picture book or in the environment?
If the client is minimally verbal, consider all of the above and also include:
 t Does the child name familiar objects?
 t Can the child count or say the alphabet?
 t Does the child use any word combinations?
 t Does the child use simple grammatical morphemes (e.g., -ing, -s)?
 t What is the child‚Äôs mean length of utterance?
 t Does the child understand words and simple phrases?
 t Does the child take turns in conversation?

CHAPTER 7 Assessment of Language in Children 
LANGUAGE  
IN CHILDREN
If the child speaks in short phrases, consider all of the above plus the following:
 t Does the child respond to multiple-step commands?
 t Does the child use appropriate syntax?
 t Does the child use a variety of descriptive and objective words?
 t Is the child difficult to understand?
 t What phonological processes are noted?
 t Does the child demonstrate appropriate back-and-forth communicative exchanges?
And if the child is conversational, consider all of the skills previously mentioned and also 
include the following:
 t Does the child have narrative ability?
 t Does the child understand humor?
 t Can the child respond to complex commands?
In addition to the more obvious aspects of language, an assessment for early interven-
tion should include an expanded focus. The clinician should also consider the child‚Äôs  
language-learning aptitude in general. For example:
 t What is the child‚Äôs temperament?
 t Is the child easily distracted?
 t How determined is the child?
 t What is the child‚Äôs attention span?
 t What are the child‚Äôs coping behaviors?
 t Does the child seek help when needed?
 t Does the child visually focus on and track objects of interest?
Piaget‚Äôs Stages of Early Cognitive Development
Early cognitive behaviors lay a foundation for the development of language. Part of our 
current understanding of intelligence comes from research by Jean Piaget. Piaget described 
four stages of cognitive development. These are summarized in Table 7-2. The sensori-
motor stage is strongly correlated with the development of language and is summarized in 
Table 7-3. Of particular interest to speech-language pathologists is the development of the 
concepts defined in the following list because they, in particular, are related to the ability to 
comprehend and use language.
 t Imitation: Acknowledgement of the existence of a behavior and the ability to  
repeat it.
 t Deferred imitation: Imitation of a behavior following a lapse of time.
 t Means-end: Production of a volitional act to achieve a desired goal.
 t Object permanence: An understanding that an object exists even though it is not  
currently seen.
 t Functional use of objects: The use of an object as it was intended to be used.
 t Symbolic play: The use of an object to represent something else.

Late Talker vs. Language Disordered
Some children are ‚Äúlate bloomers‚Äù when it comes to verbal expression. It is sometimes difficult 
to determine which children will experience lasting language impairment and which will out-
grow it. Form 7-2, ‚ÄúLanguage Development Survey‚Äù is a predictive tool for the identification of 
expressive language delay in toddlers. Children who have fewer than 50 expressive words or no 
word combinations at age 2 are at increased risk of long-term language concerns. Those children 
who do not catch up to their same-age peers by age 3 demonstrate a language delay that is likely 
to persist throughout the school years. Additional risk factors and developmental signs that help 
clinicians predict whether a child will or will not outgrow a language delay include:
 t Family history of language disorders
 t Medical conditions such as frequent ear infections, hearing loss, or medical 
syndromes
 t Prematurity, especially with low birth weight
 t Maternal drug abuse or alcohol consumption
 t Poor nutrition
 t Minimal use of gestural communication
 t Poor eye contact
 t Minimal smiling
 t Reduced joint attention
 t Lack of symbolic play
 t Does not seem curious about surroundings or point out things of interest
 t Delayed babbling
 t Early phonological difficulties
 t Limited and simplified syllable structures
 t Limited phonetic inventories
 t Frequent deletion of initial and final consonants
 t Numerous vowel errors
 t Substitution of /h/ or glottal consonants for other consonants
 t Atypical error patterns
 t Fewer than 50 expressive words and no word combinations at age 2
Children who are more likely to outgrow a language delay tend to demonstrate:
 t Frequent and effective nonverbal communication
 t Strong language comprehension
 t Good articulatory accuracy
 t Complexity of syllable structures
 t Larger phonetic inventories
 t Typical developmental error patterns

CHAPTER 7 Assessment of Language in Children 
LANGUAGE  
IN CHILDREN
Form 7-3, ‚ÄúAssessment of Language Development,‚Äù and Form 7-4, ‚ÄúParent Question-
naire for Early Language Development‚Äù are provided in this manual to aid in the assessment 
of very young children.
FORMAL LANGUAGE TESTING
There are literally hundred of formal language tests available for the assessment of lan-
guage. Some commonly used formal tests, each with a brief summary of its focus and 
purpose, are listed in Table 7-4. A more comprehensive list can be found on the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) website. Access at http://www 
.asha.org/assessments.aspx or search for ‚ÄúDirectory of Speech-Language Pathology  
Assessment Instruments‚Äù from the homepage.
With so many tests to choose from, it is sometimes difficult to select the most appro-
priate one. Each test is unique and useful in a different situation. There is no one test, or 
even set of tests, that is right for all children or all clinicians. Be thoughtful when selecting 
appropriate testing materials. Questions to consider include:
 t How old is the client?
 t What are the specific language concerns that need to be evaluated
 t What is the client‚Äôs ethnic background?
 t How much time is available to administer the test?
 t How well will the client be able to participate in testing?
 t Is an insurance company, employer, or other agency requiring a certain test?
In all situations, administer only the most recent edition of a test. Also become familiar 
with each test‚Äôs uses, strengths, and weaknesses. See Form 1-1, ‚ÄúTest Evaluation Form,‚Äù in 
Chapter 1 for guidelines on evaluating formal assessment instruments.
INFORMAL ASSESSMENT
Informal assessment is an important component of a complete language evaluation. It allows 
the clinician to assess certain aspects of language more deeply than formal assessment al-
lows, and it provides the opportunity to view a client‚Äôs functional use of language in natural 
contexts. Relevant cognitive abilities can also be considered. In some situations, informal 
assessment data are the primary source of diagnostic information.
Informal tasks can be receptively or expressively based. They often require a certain 
amount of creativity on the part of the clinician to assess targeted behaviors. A small 
sampling of activities some clinicians use to assess language skills informally is presented 
in the following list. The techniques used will depend upon many things, including the 
age of the child, his or her current linguistic abilities, and the specific behaviors to be 
assessed.
 t Ask the child to follow verbal commands.
 t Ask the child to count, recite the alphabet, or perform other serial tasks.

 t Ask the child to name objects or pictures. Ask the child to point to more than one of 
a named item. For example, ‚Äúpoint to the pencils‚Äù (versus pencil ).
 t Ask the child to name items from a category, or identify a category when provided 
examples.
 t Ask the child to describe similarities and differences of objects.
 t Ask the child to place an object (e.g., a block) over, under, and beside the table  
(to sample basic prepositional understanding).
 t Ask the child to describe a picture, recount an event, or tell a short story.
 t Describe absurd situations and ask why they are absurd.
 t Ask the child to explain how to play a game, such as Go Fish.
 t Play Simon Says.
 t Engage in role-playing activities. For example, pretend to serve food at a restaurant; 
then reverse roles.
 t Ask the child to guide a blindfolded listener through a task, such as putting lids 
on pens.
 t Present what-if scenarios and have the child offer solutions. For example, ‚ÄúWhat 
would happen if you forgot to bring your lunch to school?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat would you do if 
you found $100 in your backpack?‚Äù
 t Play deductive ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of . . .‚Äù games.
LANGUAGE SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS
Language sampling is a vital part of a complete evaluation of language. Specific procedures 
for collecting a language sample are described in Chapter 5. There are several aspects of 
collecting a language sample that are especially important for assessing language disorders:
 t Collect a representative sample based on real conversation, not a contrived situation.
 t Collect multiple samples.
 t Vary the contexts and activities used to elicit the sample to assess different aspects of 
language.
 t Ask others to interact with the client during the sample, such as a parent, a sibling, a friend, 
or a teacher. Children commonly vary their language use depending on the audience.
 t Video-record the sample for later analysis.
Form 7-6, ‚ÄúWorksheet for Recording a Language Sample,‚Äù is helpful for collecting data. 
The following guidelines are useful when transcribing the language sample:
 t Transcribe the entire sample.
 t Indicate the speaker for all utterances. For example, mark A for adult (or P for part-
ner) and C for client or child. Create your own abbreviations as needed.
 t Use phonetic symbols only to transcribe unintelligible or partially intelligible utter-
ances. A dash (‚Äî) can also be used to indicate each unintelligible word. For example, 
‚ÄúI want ‚Äî ‚Äî‚Äù indicates a four-word utterance with two unintelligible words.

 t Capitalize only proper nouns and the pronoun I.
 t Keep punctuation to a minimum.
 t Indicate utterance endings with a slash (/).
 t Number the client‚Äôs utterances.
 t Transcribe utterances consecutively from the recording. The first few utterances can 
be omitted because this could be considered a ‚Äúwarming-up‚Äù period.
A good language sample may provide the most useful information about a client‚Äôs func-
tional use of language. When analyzing the language sample, make observations about the 
following features of language:
 t Form of language: Does the child primarily use single words, phrases, or sentences? 
Are the sentences of the subject-verb-object form exclusively? Are there mature nega-
tives, interrogatives, and passive sentences? Does the child elaborate the noun or verb 
phrase? Is there evidence of embedding and conjoining?
 t Understanding of semantic intent: Does the child respond appropriately to the  
various question forms (what, where, who, when, why, how)? Does the child confuse 
words from different semantic classes?
 t Language use: Does the child display a range of illocutionary functions such as asking 
for information, help, and objects; replying; making statements; providing informa-
tion? Does the child take conversational turns? Does the child introduce topics and 
maintain them through several turns? Does the child signal the status of the commu-
nication and make repairs?
 t Rate of speaking: Is the rate inordinately slow or fast? Are there noticeable or lengthy 
pauses between the caregiver‚Äôs and the child‚Äôs turn? Are there noticeable or lengthy 
pauses between the child‚Äôs adjacent utterances? Does the child use fillers frequently or 
pause before producing certain words? Are there frequent word substitutions?
 t Sequencing: Does the child relate events in a sequential fashion based on the  
order of occurrence? Can the child discuss the recent past or recount stories? 
(Owens, 1995, p. 76)
The analysis of a language sample can be a very time-consuming endeavor. Comput-
erized tools are helpful for analyzing samples efficiently. The clinician also benefits from 
having data stored electronically for future retrieval. Computer-based tools for the analysis 
of a language sample include:
 t Computerized Profiling (Long, Fey, & Channell, 2006)
 t Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) (Miller, 2012)
 t The CHILDES Project: Tools for Analyzing Talk (MacWhinney, 2000)
ASSESSMENT OF MORPHOLOGIC SKILLS
Morphology is the study of how morphemes (the smallest units of meaning) are combined 
to form meaning. Free morphemes are words that can stand alone to convey meaning (e.g., 
case or boy), whereas bound morphemes (e.g., -s or -ing) are word segments that must be

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
attached to a free morpheme to convey meaning. Grammatic morphemes are free or bound 
morphemes with little or no meaning when produced by themselves, such as articles (a, the, 
etc.), prepositions (in, at, etc.), and grammatical word segments (-ing, -ed, etc.).
Bound morphemes can be either derivational or inflectional. Derivational morphemes 
are those that change the meaning and grammatical class of a word (e.g., the verb vote to 
the noun voter, or the adjective quick to the adverb quickly). Inflectional morphemes are 
those that affect nuances of meaning, but not the basic meaning or grammatical class of a 
word (e.g., the noun apple still refers to the same fruit when an -s is added to form apples). 
An extensive list of bound morphemes is presented in Table 7-5. The clinician can use the 
information in this table to identify which features a client is using appropriately and which 
features are not used or have not yet been sampled.

The ‚ÄúAssessment of Morphologic Features,‚Äù Form 7-7, is provided to help identify the 
morphologic structures a client uses correctly and incorrectly. This is a challenging task  
because it is difficult at times to structure opportunities to produce the various target  
features. We recommend using the language sample to identify as many forms as possible, 
then using structured questions to elicit those forms that were not sampled through the 
language sample.
DETERMINING MEAN LENGTH OF UTTERANCE
The mean length of utterance (MLU) is the average number of morphemes (or words, as 
will be described later) that a client produces in an utterance. MLU provides important 
information about language development, and it is one indicator of a language delay or dis-
order. Generally, a normal child‚Äôs chronological age (up to age 5) will correspond closely to 
his or her MLU. For example, a normally developing 4-year, 3-month-old child will often 
exhibit a MLU of approximately 4.3 (plus or minus a few tenths). This method of interpre-
tation is very general and must, of course, be used with caution when diagnosing or ruling 
out language disorders. Remember, children develop language at varying rates.
Roger Brown‚Äôs (1973) classic study of three preschool-age children‚ÄîAdam, Eve, and 
Sarah‚Äîprovided the foundation for much of our current understanding of the relationship 
between MLU and language development.
Although Brown‚Äôs research was based on only three subjects, subsequent research has 
largely validated his early findings. MLU is considered to be a valid and reliable index of  
general language development. Brown‚Äôs developmental stages are presented in Table 7-6. In 
addition to identifying stages of language development, Brown also identified a sequence of 
normal development for 14 grammatical morphemes. His findings are based on 90% mastery 
of each morpheme. His sequence of morphologic development is presented in Table 7-7.

Using a larger number of subjects, Miller and Chapman (1981) conducted a study in 
which MLUs from conversational speech samples were compared with children‚Äôs chrono-
logical ages. Their findings are presented in Table 7-8. The table outlines predicted MLUs 
and standard deviations (SDs) for children 18 months through 5 years of age. The sample 
group in Miller and Chapman‚Äôs study consisted of 123 middle- to upper-class midwestern 
children in Madison, Wisconsin. As with any normative data, use caution when applying the 
information to children who are dissimilar to the population studied.
Before calculating MLU, it is important to obtain a sizeable speech-language sample. 
The more utterances sampled, the more accurate the MLU findings will be. (Information 
on obtaining speech samples can be found in Chapter 5.) After transcribing the sample, the 
clinician may use the following guidelines for counting morphemes per utterance (based on 
Brown, 1973; Lund & Duchan, 1993).
Count as one morpheme:
 t Grammatical morphemes that are whole words (nouns, verbs, articles, prepositions)
 t Auxiliaries (e.g., is, will, have, must, would)
 t Diminutives (e.g., mommy, doggy)
 t Catentatives (e.g., wanna, gonna)
 t Uninflected lexical morphemes (e.g., run, fall)
 t Inflections (possessive -‚Äôs, plural -s, third-person singular -s, regular past-tense -ed, 
progressive -ing)
 t Irregular past tense (e.g., did, was, got, went)

 t Contractions (e.g., I‚Äôll, can‚Äôt) only if individual segments do not occur elsewhere in the 
sample. If either of the constituent parts of the contraction occur elsewhere, the con-
traction is counted as two morphemes.
 t Plurals that do not occur in singular form (e.g., us, clothes)
 t Gerunds and participles that are not part of a verb phrase (e.g., She was tired. Swim-
ming is fun.)
 t Stuttered words (e.g., My, my, my . . .)

Count as more than one morpheme:
 t Inflected forms: regular and irregular plural nouns, possessive nouns, third-person sin-
gular verbs, present participle and past participle when part of the verb phrase, regular 
past-tense verbs, reflexive pronouns, comparative and superlative adverbs, adjectives

 t Contractions only when one or both of the constituent parts occurs separately else-
where in the sample (e.g., It‚Äôs if it or is occurs elsewhere)
 t Repeated words only if the word is produced for emphasis (e.g., No, no, no! is counted 
as three morphemes)
Do not count:
 t Partial utterances
 t Imitations that immediately follow a model utterance
 t Elliptical answers to questions
 t Unintelligible utterances
 t Rote passages (e.g., nursery rhymes, songs)
 t False starts and reformations
 t Noises, unless they are meaningfully integrated into an utterance (e.g., She went kkkhhh.)
 t Fillers (e.g., um, oh, you know)
 t Counting, sequences, or other enumerations (e.g., cow, dog, pig, horse)
After the morphemes in each utterance are counted, the MLU can be calculated. The 
traditional method of calculating MLU is to divide the number of morphemes by the num-
ber of utterances. For example:
150 morphemes
50 utterances
 " 3.0 MLU
Many clinicians also calculate the MLU for words by dividing the number of words by 
the number of utterances. This calculation does not reflect the use of bound morphemes 
(e.g., -ing, -ed, -s); therefore, the MLU for words will always be equal to or smaller than the 
MLU for morphemes. For example, the same 100-word sample might have:
100 words
50 utterances
 " 2.0 MLU-words
120 morphemes
50 utterances
 " 2.0 MLU-morphemes
MLU is a gross but reasonably accurate index of grammatical development up to four to 
five morphemes (Brown, 1973). It is considered gross because the MLU is a general measure 
that tells us nothing about specific forms or structures used. However, the use of both free 
and bound morphemes is needed for utterance lengths to increase.
ASSESSMENT OF PRAGMATIC SKILLS
Pragmatics is the study of the use of language in communicative interactions. Pragmatic be-
haviors are situationally and environmentally specific; therefore, it is helpful to assess prag-
matic skills in a variety of situations. Form 7-8, ‚ÄúAssessment of Pragmatic Skills,‚Äù allows the 
clinician to assess 15 pragmatic behaviors in a semistructured manner. Several suggestions 
are provided for each behavior for eliciting pragmatic responses.

ASSESSMENT OF SEMANTIC SKILLS
Semantics is the study of language meaning, which can be expressed verbally, vocally, and 
gesturally. Meaning is complex and strongly influenced by context. Word definitions, syntac-
tic structures, environmental situations, speaker relationships, pragmatic behaviors, and su-
prasegmental aspects of language intertwine to give language its meaning. Imagine greeting 
a friend by saying starch instead of hi. Even though the friend knows what the word starch 
means, it would have no meaning in such a social context.
Assessing semantic skills is difficult because of this inherent complexity and also due to a 
lack of normative standards. In general, when assessing semantic skills, look for variety. The 
more mature the speaker, the greater the range of words and word types the speaker should 
exhibit. Children with semantic language disorders usually demonstrate limited vocabularies 
and difficulty integrating semantic information with other aspects of language, particularly 
grammar.
Some clinicians evaluate language according to semantic relations. The most common 
semantic relations are presented in Table 7-9. When categorizing a language sample accord-
ing to semantic relations, note the range of semantic categories used by the client. A limited 
range would indicate a possible language disorder.

Form 7-9, ‚ÄúAssessment of Semantic Skills,‚Äù is a worksheet for the informal assessment 
of semantic abilities. The clinician may also want to use other materials in this book, such 
as ‚ÄúPictures,‚Äù ‚ÄúNarratives,‚Äù or ‚ÄúConversation Starters for Eliciting a Language Sample‚Äù (see 
Chapter 5). Playing games such as Simon Says, telling jokes, and looking through picture 
books may also be helpful. While conversing with the child, try using words inappropriately 
or making nonsense remarks and note the child‚Äôs response. When assessing semantic skills, 
note the following:
 t Number of different words
 t Unusual use of words
 t Incorrect word substitutions
 t Overgeneralizations
 t Undergeneralizations
 t Frequent use of empty words such as thing or that
 t Word-finding problems, such as circumlocutions, repetitions, and frequent pauses
 t Types of words (e.g., function, prepositions, negatives, descriptive)
 t Excessive use of pronouns
 t Frequent use of routinized expressions such as you know
 t Unusual sentence formulations
 t Difficulty with word comprehension
 t Difficulty with sentence comprehension
 t Poor understanding of nonliteral forms (e.g., idioms, metaphors, proverbs)
 t Poor understanding of common slang terms
ASSESSMENT OF SYNTACTIC SKILLS
Syntax refers to sentence structure. Our English language is based on many syntactic struc-
tures, making syntax a difficult area to assess. A solid understanding of the basic syntactic 
elements of language is necessary before any type of analysis can be completed. The various 
parts of speech are summarized in the following list. For more in-depth study, consult a book 
on English grammar and form.
There are eight major parts of speech:
 t Noun: A word that represents a person, place, or thing (e.g., flower, family, anger)
 t Pronoun: A word that takes the place of a noun (e.g., I, it, this, which)
 t Adjective: A word that modifies a noun or pronoun, usually by description  
(e.g., happy, long, difficult)
 t Verb: A word that indicates action or a state of being (e.g., run, make, have, am)
 t Adverb: A word that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb by answering the 
question how? when? where? why? or to what extent? (e.g., badly, loudly, well )
 t Preposition: A word that shows the relationship of the noun or pronoun to some 
other word in the sentence (e.g., in, by, with, throughout)

CHAPTER 7 Assessment of Language in Children 
LANGUAGE  
IN CHILDREN
 t Conjunction: A word that joins a phrase, clause, sentence, or other words together 
(e.g., and, but, because, or)
 t Interjection: A stand-alone word that expresses emotion (e.g., ouch, oh, yeah, bravo)
These foundational parts of speech are combined into units. The most basic units are 
phrases and clauses. Phrases are groups of related words that do not contain both a subject 
and a predicate. These include:
 t Noun phrase: A group of words that acts as a noun (That book is funny. Going to the 
zoo was the highlight. The boy in the middle is David.)
 t Verb phrase: A group of words that acts as a verb (The project will be finished soon. 
Good mothers discipline with love and patience.)
 t Prepositional phrase: A group of words that acts as a preposition (the girl in front, a 
tree in the park)
 t Adjective phrase: A group of words that modifies a noun or pronoun (Tired from the 
long day, he fell asleep. The girl with the long hair)
Clauses are groups of related words that have both a subject and a predicate. There are 
two types:
 t Main clause or independent clause: A grammatically complete unit that can stand 
alone and make sense (She went to the store, and she bought same cookies. The ball rolled 
away and landed under the table.)
 t Subordinate clause or dependent clause: A unit that cannot stand alone and make 
sense without being joined to a main clause (Because it is late, I must leave now. Sarah 
wrote that you were coming.)
Clauses and phrases are combined to form sentences. Sentences are generally classified 
according to structure or function. There are four basic sentence structures:
 t Simple sentence: A sentence that contains one main clause (He is old. Why are you  
doing that?)
 t Compound sentence: A sentence that contains two or more related main clauses 
(Mommy made the cake and daddy made the punch. You like green; I like blue.)
 t Complex sentence: A sentence that has one main clause and one or more subordinate 
clauses (Even though it was late, mom let us stay up to watch the fireworks. After we went 
home, we fell asleep quickly just as you said we would. [main clauses are underlined])
 t Compound-complex sentence: A sentence that has two or more main clauses and  
one or more subordinate clauses (Because the weather was nice, the children played and  
I planted flowers. If it‚Äôs heads, you win; if it‚Äôs tails, I win. [main clauses are underlined]).
Sentence classification according to function is as follows:
 t Declarative: A sentence that states a fact or makes an assertion (I am going now. You‚Äôre late.)
 t Interrogative: A sentence that asks a question (What happened? Whose is it?)
 t Imperative: A sentence that gives a command or makes a request. The subject ‚Äúyou‚Äù is 
often understood and not expressed (Go away! Please give this to your teacher.).
 t Exclamatory: A sentence that conveys a strong feeling. In some cases, the subject is 
understood without being expressed (How thoughtful! We were so surprised!).

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
The most predominant and basic order of words in a sentence is subject-verb-object 
(S-V-O) word order (I went home. The children are playing soccer.) This is an active sentence 
format in which the subject performs an action. Normally developing speakers learn to  
rearrange the subject/verb/object elements. For example, a passive sentence is based on an 
object-verb-subject format (The boy was bit by a dog. The crops were destroyed by the rain.)
The most significant strides in semantic aspects of language development are made dur-
ing the first 5 years of life. Table 7-10 outlines the developmental stages of early syntactic 
acquisition. The more complex forms just described continue to be learned well into the 
elementary and middle school years.
In the preceding section on assessment of semantic skills, it was stated that variety is 
one of the best indicators of a child‚Äôs language abilities. The same is true when analyzing se-
mantic features of language. Look for a variety of word types, phrases, clauses, and sentence

types. Also look for patterns of correct usage and incorrect usage. Children with language 
impairments are likely to demonstrate:
 t Simple, less elaborate noun phrases
 t Shorter utterances
 t Limited range of sentence types
 t Overreliance on the S-V-O sentence structure
 t Lack of sentence complexity
 t Confusion with pronoun references
 t Misinterpretations of passive sentences
Form 7-10, ‚ÄúAssessment of Syntactic Skills,‚Äù is a worksheet for identifying syntactic fea-
tures utterance by utterance. There are also computerized programs that are particularly 
helpful for evaluating syntactic elements of language. Several were listed earlier in this chap-
ter in the section as language sampling and analysis.
MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
In each subsection of this chapter, criteria for diagnosing the particular element of language 
addressed are provided. There are also some general guidelines that are helpful for making 
an appropriate diagnosis. A child with a language disorder will typically demonstrate one or 
more of the following deficiencies:
 t Delayed onset of language
 t Limited amount of language
 t Deficiencies in syntactic, semantic, and morphologic components
 t Deficient cognitive skills
 t Academic problems
 t Limited language comprehension
 t Poor listening skills
 t Limited conversational skills
 t Limited ability to narrate experiences
 t A general inappropriate use of language
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Spoken language is complex, varied, and often challenging to evaluate. A combination of 
formal and informal assessment measures usually provides the most complete diagnostic in-
formation. For children who are still in the early developmental stages of language, parental 
input and involvement is particularly important. A representative language sample is valu-
able for understanding a client‚Äôs functional use of language, including pragmatic, semantic, 
syntactic, and morphologic components.

L
iteracy is commonly defined as an ability to read and write.1 There is a strong reciprocal 
relationship between expressive language and literacy. Many of the same linguistic skills 
are necessary for the acquisition and functional use of both oral and written language, with 
additional higher-level skills required for written language. This chapter is an extension of 
the preceding chapter, as both chapters address issues of language assessment. Chapter 7 
focused primarily on the assessment of nonwritten language. This chapter will provide re-
sources for evaluating and diagnosing written language disorders.

1 The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 defines literacy as ‚Äúan individual‚Äôs ability to read, write, and speak in English [or other 
language for non-English speakers], compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job, in the 
family of the individual and in society‚Äù (National Institute for Literacy, 2006). This text adheres to the more common definition, 
which is limited to reading and writing, even though technically it is less accurate.

Role of the Speech-Language Pathologist
Historically, speech-language pathologists have been involved in the diagnosis and treatment 
of receptive and expressive aspects of language; that is, listening, comprehension, and speaking. 
More recently, we have become important members of the interdisciplinary team that serves 
clients with developmental reading and writing disabilities. Other members of the team include 
teachers, reading specialists, and other special educators. Because of their training in language 
acquisition, speech-language pathologists are able to identify literacy problems and also explain 
why problems exist. Specific roles and responsibilities of speech-language pathologists are:
 t Prevention of written language problems
 t Identification of clients with, or at risk for, literacy problems
 t Assessment of reading and writing as they relate to spoken communication and aca-
demic (or professional) achievement
 t Intervention for reading and writing deficits
 t Other roles, including advocating for effective literacy practices, advancing 
the knowledge base, and assisting teachers, families, and students (American 
Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2002)
NORMAL READING AND WRITING DEVELOPMENT
The development of reading precedes the development of writing in much the same way audi-
tory comprehension precedes verbal expression; the former lays the foundation for the latter. The 
development of all aspects of language begins at birth. The following developmental progression 
highlights milestones for reading and writing in a normally developing child (data from American  
Speech-Language Hearing Association, 2009; Chall, 1983, 1996; Gentry, 2004).
Birth‚Äì2 Years
Reading
 t From birth, a child is exposed to print (e.g., on household items, billboards, books, etc.).
 t Child accumulates knowledge about letters, words, and books.

 t Metalinguistic knowledge develops (i.e., knowledge that language consists of discrete 
phonemes, words, phrases, and sentences).
 t Phonological awareness develops (i.e., awareness that words are made up of sound segments).
 t Knowledge of the alphabetic principle begins (i.e., letters in English represent speech 
sounds).
 t Child recognizes words that rhyme (e.g., hat, rat) and words that begin with the same 
sound (e.g., big ball).
 t Print awareness develops; child understands that print has meaning and structure 
(e.g., moves from left to right, top to bottom; words are separated by space). Child 
recognizes trademark logos (e.g., McDonald‚Äôs¬Æ) and the child‚Äôs own name.
Writing
 t Child scribbles, but with no discernable letters.
 t Some scribble shows basic knowledge of conventional rules of writing; scribble may 
occur in lines, may flow from left to right and top to bottom, and may show some 
conventional spacing.
4 Years
Reading
 t Phonemic awareness develops (i.e., awareness that words are made up of specific units 
of sounds that have distinct features).
 t Child says words that rhyme (e.g., dog, frog) and words that begin with the same 
sound (e.g., cup, cap).
 t Child segments a sentence into separate words (e.g., The boy jumped is segmented to 
the-boy-jumped).
 t Child counts the number of syllables in words.
Writing
 t Writing resembles standard letters and words.
 t Child must interpret his or her writing for others.
5 Years (Kindergarten)
Reading
 t Child knows when words do not rhyme (e.g., hog does not rhyme with hat).
 t Child recites and names letters of the alphabet and numbers 1‚Äì10.
 t Child identifies the first sound of a spoken word and separates it from the rime (the first 
vowel and any following vowels and consonants of a syllable) (e.g., dog begins with d).
 t Child blends the beginning sound with the remaining sounds of a word.
 t Child segments multisyllabic words into syllables (e.g., elephant is el-e-phant).
 t Child reads some familiar words by sight.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
Much of our current knowledge of reading and writing development is based on 
the work of psychologist Jeanne Chall. She was an advocate of phonics-based reading 
instruction and described reading as a developmental process. It is now widely accepted 
that children learn to read through third grade; from then on, they read to learn. Begin-
ning in fourth grade, students face more complex sentence structures, abstract concepts, 
and advanced vocabulary. A person who has not mastered the basics of reading is likely 
to experience significant challenges throughout his or her lifetime academically and 
professionally.
DESCRIPTIONS AND CATEGORIES OF READING DISABILITIES
There are three main categories of reading disability: dyslexia, language-based learning dis-
ability (LLD), and hyperlexia. Descriptions and features of each category are as follows:
 t Developmental dyslexia is also called specific reading disability. Dyslexia is geneti-
cally based and is caused by atypical neurological development (Shaywitz, 2003). 
Children with dyslexia are sometimes considered ‚Äúunexpected reading failures‚Äù 
because they appear to be developing normally until they start trying to read. The 
primary symptom of dyslexia is poor phonemic awareness. A child with dyslexia 
will perform normally on receptive/expressive language tests, but poorly on read-
ing tests.
 t Language-based learning disability (LLD) is a more generalized language disability 
that includes deficiencies in all areas of language. A child with an LLD will perform 
poorly on both receptive/expressive language tests and reading tests.
 t Hyperlexia is an ability to read words significantly above age expectations but without 
comprehension of what is read. It can be a symptom of autism.
There are certain behaviors and characteristics that children with a reading disability 
may demonstrate. These include:
 t Poor phonemic awareness
 t Poor word recognition
 t Difficulty with orthographic processing
 t Difficulty with phonetic decoding of new words
 t Difficulty attaching meaning to words, phrases, and sentences
 t Difficulty with grammar, including knowledge of regular and irregular morphemes 
and knowledge of various sentence structures
 t Difficulty processing complex sentences
 t Overreliance on contextual cues, sometimes guessing instead of decoding
 t Lack of interest in literature; frustration instead of pleasure
 t Reduced speaking rate and increased pausing during speaking
 t Limited vocabulary
 t Poor comprehension of stories
 t Poor social skills

LITERACY
CHAPTER 8 Assessment of Literacy
ASSESSMENT OF EARLY LITERACY
Preschool-age children with oral language deficits are at high risk of developing written lan-
guage deficits in their school years. Deficits in oral language, phonological awareness, print 
awareness, and metalinguistics that are identified and remediated early can significantly in-
crease a child‚Äôs potential for academic success later in life. Speech-language pathologists in 
the preschool environment are often best able to identify children at risk for future literacy 
problems.
Early indicators of reading disability include:
 t Family history of reading disability
 t First word not produced until after 15 months of age
 t Words not combined until after 24 months of age
 t Difficulty pronouncing words past 6 years of age
 t Poor memory for, and awareness of, rhymes during preschool years
 t Inability to segment words into syllables before age 5 (Naremore, Densmore, &  
Harman, 2001; Shaywitz, 2003)
Children in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten should be screened for phonological 
awareness skills to predict the later development of a reading disability. Evaluate children on 
measures of the child‚Äôs:
 t Phonemic awareness
 t Rapid naming of letters, numbers, and objects
 t Print awareness (Goldsworthy, 2003)
Form 8-1, ‚ÄúChecklist of Early Literacy Skills,‚Äù can be completed by a child‚Äôs parent, 
teacher, resource specialist, speech-language pathologist, or other person involved in a child‚Äôs 
care. Sections of Form 8-2, ‚ÄúAssessment of Phonemic Awareness,‚Äù are also appropriate for 
evaluating early literacy.
ASSESSMENT OF READING
When testing for a reading disorder, evaluate all aspects of language, with a particular  
emphasis on the child‚Äôs:
 t Phonological awareness
 t Word fluency
 t Narrative schema knowledge
Clients with a reading disability are most likely to show struggle in one or more of these 
three areas. When evaluating older children, measures of writing skills are also important 
considerations. A referral to an audiologist for an assessment of hearing may be necessary to 
rule out hearing loss or (central) auditory processing disorder. A vision screen or evaluation 
may also be necessary to rule out visual deficiencies.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
Phonological Awareness
The most distinguishing feature of a reading disability is poor phonological awareness. The 
child has difficulty identifying and blending together individual phonemes in words. Vinson 
(2001, 2007) recommends these considerations when assessing phonemic knowledge:
 t Phonetic segmentation (sound differentiation): Can the child count phonemes in  
a word? Pronounce individual sounds? Delete or add sounds to words? Relocate  
phonemes in words?
 t Phoneme synthesis (sound blending): Can the child blend sounds that are presented 
in isolation to form a word?
 t Sound comparison: Can the child compare the sounds of different words (e.g., Which 
words begin with the same sound: cat, tap, cap?)
Clinical expectations of phonemic awareness vary depending upon a child‚Äôs age. Table 8-1  
presents a progression of phonemic awareness benchmarks for children ages 3 through 8. 
This information can be helpful in the diagnostic process to discern whether a child‚Äôs skills 
are developmentally normal or if there is cause for concern.

LITERACY
CHAPTER 8 Assessment of Literacy
Form 8-2, ‚ÄúAssessment of Phonemic Awareness,‚Äù is an informal assessment for evaluat-
ing phonemic knowledge. There are also many commercially available tests for the evalua-
tion of phonemic awareness and other aspects of literacy. Table 8-2 lists several commonly 
used tests. Age and grade ranges are provided, as well as assessment features of each test.
Word Fluency
Another strong indicator of a reading disability is word fluency, also called rapid naming 
skills. Word fluency is an ability to name symbols, words, or pictures rapidly. This discrim-
inating skill is based on speed, not accuracy. Poor readers are usually able to name symbols, 
words, and pictures accurately, but they are characteristically slower than skilled readers.
An effective method of evaluating word fluency is to prepare index cards with letters, 
numbers, pictures, or words. The prompts on the cards will depend upon the age and abilities 
of the child; some children cannot be expected to read words but can be expected to name 
pictures, numbers, or letters. Present each card separately and take note of the amount of 
time taken by the child to name the prompt. Delay or struggle is symptomatic of reading 
difficulty.
Standardized assessments are also helpful for objectively evaluating word fluency. See 
Table 8-2 for a list of formal tests.
Reading Fluency
Reading fluency may be assessed in children who can read short paragraphs or longer read-
ing passages. It is a measure of the average number of words the student correctly reads per 
minute. Poor reading fluency indicates possible problems with phonemic awareness, decod-
ing skills, comprehension, or vocabulary. To determine word fluency for oral reading:
1. Count the number of correctly read words in a passage.
2. Multiply that number by 60.
3. Determine the number of seconds taken to read the passage.
4. Divide the number obtained in Step 2 by the number obtained in Step 3.

LITERACY
CHAPTER 8 Assessment of Literacy
For example, if a student reads 407 words in 4 minutes, 25 seconds, that student‚Äôs reading 
rate is 47 words per minute. Step-by-step, that is:
1. 407 words in the passage
2. 407 3 60 5 24,420
3. 4:25 minutes taken to read the passage 5 265 seconds
4. 24,420 4 265 5 92 words correctly read per minute
A minimum of two unrehearsed samples should be obtained for calculating reading  
fluency. Table 8-3 summarizes reading fluency norms for students in grades 1‚Äì8, assessed at 
different times during the academic year. It is based on the extensive research of Hasbrouck 
and Tindal (2006). They recommend a fluency-building program for students who score 10 
or more words below their grade level‚Äôs 50th percentile, as shown in the table. Review their 
research for additional normative data.
Narrative Schema Knowledge
Another important component of a literacy assessment is evaluation of narrative schema 
knowledge, which is knowledge of story structure. Children with poor narrative schema 
knowledge also demonstrate poor linguistic complexity and reading comprehension 
(Naremore, Densmore, & Harman, 2001). Narrative production requires an ability to simul-
taneously sequence events, use appropriate vocabulary, follow rules of sentence structure, and

present a story in a cohesive and logical fashion. Stein and Glenn (1979) labeled the essential 
and binding elements of a story the story grammar. Their elements are:
 t Setting: introduction of main characters, time, place, and context
 t Initiating event: the situation or event that sets up the conflict
 t Internal response: the characters‚Äô plan or response to the initiating event
 t Attempt: actions taken toward resolution of the conflict
 t Consequences: success or failure of the attempt; resolution
 t Reaction: characters‚Äô reaction to the resolution (feelings, actions)
Even simple narratives contain most, if not all, of these elements. As children mature, 
they are able to manipulate story grammars to weave multiple events and more complex 
layers into a single story.
There are different strategies for assessing narrative schema knowledge. The age and 
ability of the client will dictate the most appropriate method. One strategy is to read a short 
story to the client and ask comprehension questions. For example:
 t Who was in the story?
 t Where did the story take place?
 t What was the problem in the story?
 t How was the problem solved?
 t What happened in the end?
 t Did you like the story?
 t What did you like/not like about it?
 t What would you have done if you were (main character)?

CHAPTER 8 Assessment of Literacy
 t What would have happened if (change a key element of the story)?
 t What is the title of the story?
 t If you were to give this story a new title, what would it be?
 t Who wrote this story?
Another strategy is to ask the client to retell a known story. Ask the client to tell the story 
of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Charlotte‚Äôs Web, or another popular children‚Äôs tale. Or using 
one of the narratives with pictures located in Chapter 5 (see Figures 5-6 and 5-7), read the 
story to the client and then ask the client to retell the story. The pictures can be used to aid 
in retelling, or removed to assess the child‚Äôs memory and comprehension of the story without 
visual cues. Telling stories from wordless picture books is also useful for assessing narrative 
schema knowledge.
More-capable clients may be able to make up a story or share a story from their lives. 
Use prompts such as:
 t Make up a story about an alien coming to our school.
 t Make up a story about winning a million dollars.
 t Make up a story about meeting George Washington.
 t Tell me about hitting a home run at your baseball game.
 t Tell me an adventure you had with your pet.
 t Tell me a story about something that happened to you when you were younger.
Regardless of the method used to elicit the narrative sample, analyze the narrative in 
these areas:
 t Knowledge of story elements: Is it organized with a beginning, middle, and end?  
Is the setting clear? Does it have character and plot development? Does it contain 
conflict and resolution? Does is make sense? If a story was read to the client, can the 
client answer questions about the basic elements of the story?
 t Comprehension of the story:
 - Literal comprehension: Does the client know the central theme of the story?  
Can the client paraphrase the story? Can the client identify the main characters? 
Can the client answer questions about the story?
 - Inferred comprehension: Can the client infer character thoughts, emotions or  
motivations? Can the client connect the story to personal experiences?
 t Linguistic complexity of the narrative: Did the client use a variety of sentence types, 
including simple and complex sentences? Was the vocabulary appropriate?
Form 8-3, ‚ÄúWorksheet for Narrative Analysis,‚Äù is provided to help with narrative 
assessment. Other commercially available materials for evaluating narrative knowledge 
include:
 t Assessment of Narrative Skills: What‚Äôs the Story? (Apel & Masterson, 1998)
 t Test of Narrative Language (Gillam & Pearson, 2004)

Informal Reading Inventories
An informal reading inventory (IRI) is a useful diagnostic tool for assessing reading ability 
and comprehension of grade-level material. IRIs enable the clinician to evaluate the student 
using authentic classroom-like resources, thus providing information about how well the 
student is able to read and understand academic literature.
IRIs generally consist of grade-level word lists and reading passages. The clinician can 
obtain appropriate grade-level materials from teachers, or use books with publisher-rated 
reading levels. The word lists are used to assess word recognition and fluency. The reading 
passages are used to assess reading fluency, story schema knowledge, comprehension, and 
frustration level. The student may read passages orally and/or silently, or, to assess listen-
ing ability, the clinician may read passages to the student. After each passage, the clinician  
asks 5‚Äì10 comprehension questions, including simple questions based on knowledge and 
more difficult questions based on inference. Reading accuracy is the percentage of correctly 
read words.
Findings are often categorized according to the following three levels:
1. Independent: The student can read the material independently. Reading accuracy is 
97‚Äì100%. Comprehension is excellent (90% or higher).
2. Instructional: The student can read the material with a typical amount of classroom 
help. Reading accuracy is 94‚Äì96%. Comprehension is satisfactory (75%).
3. Frustrational: The student has difficulty reading the material in a classroom setting. 
Reading accuracy is below 94%. Comprehension is poor (below 50%).
Form 8-4, ‚ÄúInformal Reading Inventory,‚Äù is a worksheet for recording informal reading 
inventory findings.
ASSESSMENT OF WRITING
Writing is, in general, the most complex form of language. In many cases, a child‚Äôs language 
difficulties are most pronounced in his or her writing. Children with oral expressive language 
problems are likely to demonstrate writing deficiencies such as spelling errors, syntactic and 
semantic errors, morphologic errors, omissions of words or word endings, and general con-
tent incongruities. Often, individuals with reading disabilities do not know how to edit or 
revise written materials, their own or another‚Äôs, because they do not have functional knowl-
edge of high-level language strategies.
Writing takes different forms depending on the audience and the writer‚Äôs purpose. Eval-
uation of narrative, expository, and persuasive forms will be described later in this chapter. In 
general, however, assessment for all types of writing should focus on:
 t Productivity: How many sentences are there? How many clauses? How many differ-
ent ideas are presented? How many words are there altogether?
 t Complexity: How many different clause types are there? How complex are they? 
How many words per sentence or clause? How many grammatically correct 
sentences?

LITERACY
CHAPTER 8 Assessment of Literacy
 t Appropriateness for audience and topic: Is the form appropriate for the topic? Is it 
written well for the intended audience?
 t Cohesiveness: Is it organized well? Does it make sense?
 t Mechanics: Are words spelled correctly? Is punctuation correct? Are capital  
letters used?
 t Analytic aspects: Does the writing have the intended effect? How successfully can the 
writer revise and edit his or her work?
Form 8-5, ‚ÄúWorksheet for Analyzing a Writing Sample,‚Äù is useful for analyzing a variety 
of written productions. It may be helpful to obtain samples of a client‚Äôs writing from his or 
her teacher. The teacher can also provide additional information about the client‚Äôs typical 
writing skills and grade-level academic benchmarks.
There are several commercially available tests for the assessment of writing skills. These 
include:
 t OWLS Written Expression (WE) Scale (Carrow-Woolfolk, 1996)
 t Test of Early Written Language (TEWL-2) (Hresko, Herron, & Peak, 1996)
 t Test of Written Language (TOWL-3) (Hammill & Larsen, 1996)
 t Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT-II) (Wechsler, 2001)
More specific analysis of writing takes different forms depending on the audience and 
the purpose of the writing. The following sections describe assessment of narrative writing, 
expository writing, and persuasive writing. Assessment of spelling is also described.
Assessment of Narrative Writing
Narrative writing tells a story or shares an experience. It can be fiction or nonfiction, and 
content is often from personal experience. The elements of a narrative were described earlier 
in this chapter in the section on narrative schema knowledge. The assessment of narrative 
writing is similar to the assessment of oral narrative except that, obviously, the written nar-
rative is recorded on paper. Analyze written narrative in the same way as oral narrative with 
additional attention paid to writing mechanics. Also, compare a client‚Äôs written narratives to 
oral narratives. Analyze similarities and differences in these areas:
 t In what general ways is the language similar or different?
 t Does the child use vocabulary in speaking that is not used in writing?
 t What word forms are used in writing as opposed to speaking?
 t In which sample is sentence complexity greater?
 t What is the average number of words per sentence or clause in each sample?
 t Which sample has a greater variety of clause types?
 t Is there variation in presentation or audience considerations?
Form 8-3, ‚ÄúWorksheet for Narrative Analysis,‚Äù can be used for analyzing written and oral 
narratives. The above questions are more easily answered if the form is used to analyze both 
sample types.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
Assessment of Expository Writing
Expository writing is a more advanced form of writing. It is nonfiction essay writing and 
its purpose is to explain, describe, or inform. Personal feelings or opinions should not be 
included. Expository writing adheres to a three-part format:
1. The thesis statement is presented in the opening paragraph.
2. Supporting paragraphs each present a different central idea that lends credence to the 
thesis. All sentences within each supporting paragraph factually relate to the para-
graph‚Äôs central idea. Transition words and phrases are important for helping the reader 
to follow the writer‚Äôs logic.
3. The concluding paragraph restates the thesis. New material is not introduced. Students 
are expected to use expository writing in the upper-elementary grades all the way through 
high school and college. Students with writing deficits of expository form are at risk for 
significant academic and life-long struggles. Form 8-6, ‚ÄúWorksheet for Expository  
Writing Analysis,‚Äù is provided to help evaluate expository writing.
Assessment of Persuasive Writing
The most advanced form of writing is persuasive writing. Its purpose is to convince the 
reader that a particular point of view is valid and correct. It includes personal opinion, sup-
ported by factual information. The format of a persuasive essay is as follows:
1. The opening paragraph contains the topic sentence, which is a statement of a position, 
not fact.
2. The supporting paragraphs present specific evidence, examples, or statistics to sup-
port the position statement. Each sentence should clearly and logically relate to the 
sentence before it and to the topic sentence. Statements of transition are important so 
that the reader can follow the writer‚Äôs logic.
3. The concluding paragraph restates the topic sentence and the most compelling sup-
portive evidence. New material is not introduced.
Form 8-7, ‚ÄúWorksheet for Persuasive Writing Analysis,‚Äù is provided to help evaluate 
persuasive writing.
Assessment of Spelling
Evaluating spelling proficiency can provide valuable diagnostic information about phono-
logical awareness and language in general. When a student is struggling with spelling, it is 
helpful to determine why. Spelling ability may provide insight into other types of knowledge 
necessary for written communication. Poor spelling may reveal weaknesses in one or more of 
the following linguistic components:
 t Phonemic awareness
 t Orthographic knowledge
 t Semantic knowledge
 t Morphologic knowledge

Commercially available assessments for spelling include the following:
 t Spelling Performance Evaluation for Language and Literacy (SPELL) (Masterson,  
Apel, & Wasowicz, 2002). This is a software assessment tool that analyzes spelling 
errors and recommends objectives for treatment.
 t Test of Written Spelling (TWS-4) (Larsen, Hammill, & Moats, 1999)
 t Word Identification and Spelling Test (WIST) (Wilson & Felton, 2004)
MULTICULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
Cultural-linguistic background must be taken into consideration during an assessment of 
literacy. Narrative conventions vary across cultures. Standards of reading and writing in 
American English are not necessarily the same, or even similar, in other languages. Clients 
who come from homes in which English is not the primary language frequently develop 
problems with written language. English may not be spoken in the home or, if spoken, it 
may not be a good model for oral and written English development. Some children may be 
from lower-income homes where the parents are not highly educated; the children may not 
be exposed to literature that facilitates the development of reading and writing.
Keep in mind that academic language ability, referred to as cognitive academic language 
proficiency (CALP), develops slower than social language proficiency, referred to as basic 
interpersonal communication skills (BICS), among individuals learning English as a second 
language. CALP and BICS are described in more detail in Chapter 2. A student‚Äôs level of 
progress on the continuum of second-language acquisition needs to be considered when 
assessing reading and writing aptitude.
Speech-language pathologists working with multicultural children often find it bene-
ficial to address the needs of both the child and the child‚Äôs family. In many communities, 
family literacy programs exist that are designed specifically to help parents improve their 
own literacy skills and promote the literacy of their children. Information about local 
family literacy programs and other resources may be found by contacting the following 
organizations:
 t County Offices of Education
 t State Directors of Adult Education
 t The National Center for Family Literacy
 t U.S. Department of Education Division of Adult Education and Literacy 
Clearinghouse
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Oral language provides the foundation for the development of reading and writing. Chil-
dren with oral language problems frequently develop disorders of literacy. Speech-language 
pathologists are able to use their knowledge of language development, phonology, and mor-
phologic, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic systems to diagnose or predict language-based 
reading and writing disorders.

CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the  American 
Psychiatric Association, is the authoritative resource for defining many deviant speech- 
language behaviors, including social communicative disorders and autism spectrum disor-
ders. In the 5th edition of the DSM (DSM-5, 2013), the definition of autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) was significantly redefined. The previous subcategories of autistic disorder‚Äî 
Asperger disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett syndrome, and pervasive develop-
mental disorder not otherwise specified‚Äîare now replaced with a single diagnosis of autism 
spectrum disorder with varying degrees of severity. Most individuals with a pre-existing 
diagnosis are assigned the new DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD without need for reevaluation. 
The current definition of ASD is based on two areas of function: (1) social communication

and (2) fixated interests and repetitive behaviors. A diagnosis of ASD requires evidence of 
deficits in both areas. A severity rating is then applied to each area based on the amount  
of support needed. Severity values are as follows:
 t Level 1 ‚Äî Requiring support
 t Level 2 ‚Äî Requiring substantial support
 t Level 3 ‚Äî Requiring very substantial support
A more complete summary of ASD symptoms is presented in Table 9-1. Severity guidelines 
are presented in Table 9-2.
TABLE 9-1. 
Diagnostic Criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder
All five of these criteria must be present to positively diagnose ASD:
1. Impaired Social Communication. The individual has difficulties with social communication 
and interaction in multiple contexts that cannot be accounted for by general developmental 
delay, intellectual disability, or other condition. These difficulties are manifest by all three of the 
following symptoms:
a. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity. The individual demonstrates abnormal social 
approach, lack of social initiation or response, deficient back-and-forth communicative 
exchange, and/or limited sharing of interests, emotions, or affect. 
b. Deficits in nonverbal communication used for social interaction. The individual demonstrates 
poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication, abnormal eye contact and body 
language, poor knowledge and use of gestures, or lack of facial expression.
c. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. The individual does 
not adjust behaviors according to social context, demonstrates deficient imaginative play, 
has difficulty making friends, or altogether lacks interest in peers.
2. Restricted and Repetitive Interests, Activities, and Behaviors. The individual demonstrates at 
least two of the following four symptoms:
a. Stereotyped or repetitive speech, motor movements, or use of objects. This may include 
abnormal motor behaviors such as rocking or spinning, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases,  
or repetitive and unusual use of objects such as flipping, spinning, or lining up toys.
b. Inflexibility. The individual is abnormally distressed by small changes in routine, has trouble 
with transitions, or expresses rigid patterns of thought. He or she may demonstrate ritualized 
verbal or nonverbal behavior, insist on the same driving routes or foods, or incessantly 
question changes to routine.
c. Abnormally restricted or fixated interests. The individual demonstrates unusually strong 
attachments to or preoccupation with unusual objects, an extremely limited range of 
personal interests, or perseverative behavior.
d. Hyper- or hypoactive sensory behavior. The individual may demonstrate extreme responses 
(overreaction or lack of response) to sensations such as pain, hot/cold temperatures, 
sounds, textures, or smells. He or she may be fascinated with lights or spinning objects.
3. The person‚Äôs social communicative challenges have a negative impact on relationships, 
academic achievement, and/or occupational performance.
4. Onset of symptoms occurs in early childhood even if behaviors are not recognized until later 
when communication demands exceed abilities.
5. These behaviors cannot be accounted for by intellectual disability, developmental delay,  
or any other diagnosis.

It is important to note that ASD is separate from intellectual disability or other 
speech-language diagnosis; however, more than one diagnosis can co-occur in the same 
client. In order to accurately diagnose ASD, the client‚Äôs social communication should be 
below what would be expected for his or her overall developmental level or other known 
diagnoses. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL (PRAGMATIC)  
COMMUNICATION DISORDER
Some clients may seem to have difficulty with social communication, yet do not meet the re-
quirements for a diagnosis of ASD. These clients may meet the criteria for social (pragmatic) 
communication disorder (SCD), a new diagnosis introduced in the DSM-5. Characteristics 
of SCD are:
 t Difficulty with social verbal and nonverbal communication that cannot be accounted 
for by intellectual disability, specific language impairment, autism spectrum disorder, 
or other diagnosis.

 t Difficulty acquiring and using spoken and written language. The individual may 
demonstrate difficulty following rules for conversation and storytelling, or may not 
understand nonliteral or ambiguous language. 
 t Inappropriate responses in conversation. The individual may have difficulty modify-
ing communication according to changes in audience or context.
 t The person‚Äôs social communicative challenges have a negative impact on relationships, 
academic achievement, and/or occupational performance.
 t Onset of symptoms occurs in early childhood even if behaviors are not recognized 
until later when communication demands exceed abilities.
EARLY INDICATORS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER  
OR SOCIAL COMMUNICATION DISORDER
It is important to diagnose ASD or SCD as early as possible so that appropriate interventions 
can begin. Current research indicates that diagnoses before children are 3 years of age, when 
made by knowledgeable and experienced professionals, are stable; children do not outgrow the 
disorder. It is also worth noting that a positive diagnosis requires the presence of abnormal behav-
iors in early childhood, even if these behaviors are not clearly recognized until later in life. Many 
of the early indicators of ASD and SCD are listed below. In most cases, early signs have more to 
do with what a child does not do than what a child does do. Young children with autism often:
 t Do not respond to social bids
 t Do not smile responsively
 t Do not reciprocate affection
 t Use limited to no eye contact during interactions
 t Do not imitate the actions of others (e.g., wave goodbye)
 t Do not repeat behaviors that produce attention or laughter
 t Show limited interest in other children
 t Do not understand gestures or use gestures to communicate
 t Do not engage in a broad repertoire of functional play activities
 t Do not create simple play schemes or sequences with toys
 t Do not engage in imaginative play
 t Engage in repetitive play activities
 t Demonstrate repetitive motor behaviors
 t Respond inconsistently to sounds
 t Show unusual visual interests (e.g., spinning objects, studying objects)
Although the behaviors in the previous list may or may not be early signs of ASD or SCD, the 
presence of the following behaviors are absolute indicators of a need for further evaluation:
 t No warm smiles or joyful expressions by 6 months
 t No back-and-forth communicative exchange of sounds, smiles, or other facial expres-
sions by 9 months
 t No babbling by 12 months

 t No communicative gesturing by 12 months
 t No single words by 16 months
 t No meaningful two-word phrases by 24 months (some echolalic phrases may be present)

The ‚ÄúAutism and Social Communication Disorder Screening Form,‚Äù Form 9-1, is a 
parent questionnaire designed to identify young children who may have autism spectrum 
disorder or social communication disorder. Other screening tools for early identification 
include:
 t Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers-Revised with Follow Up (M-CHAT-R/F) 
(Robins, Fein, & Barton, 2009) (Note: available online as free download for clinical 
use at www.m-chat.org)
 t Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (Stone, Coonrod, & Ousley, 2000)
 t Social Communication Questionnaire (Rutter, Bailey, Lord, & Berument, 2003)
SOCIAL COMMUNICATION
Social communication refers to the knowledge and use of language and pragmatics to in-
teract with another person or group of people. There are many skills involved in effectively 
and naturally interacting with others. These include reciprocating experiences and emotions, 
understanding and using gestures and facial expressions, following rules of conversation, 
recognizing social cues and adjusting as needed, and using appropriate language and voice. 
A significant and central component of both autism spectrum disorder and social communi-
cation disorder is a client‚Äôs deficient social communication. In order to assess a client‚Äôs social 
communication skills, it is important to know normal developmental expectations. Table 9-3

LANGUAGE CONCERNS
Even though language development and use are not identified as specific characteristics of 
autism or social communication disorder, clients with these disorders are likely to demon-
strate certain patterns of language comprehension and expression. Several behaviors that are 
typical are listed below by category. Because of individual variability, not all of the behaviors 
will be seen in every client.

ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS
An authentic assessment approach is the most desirable approach for evaluating the speech 
and language skills of clients with autism spectrum disorder or social communicative disorder. 
Clinical judgments and decision are based primarily on case history information, consultations 
with other professionals who work with the client, clinical observations in multiple settings, play 
assessment, and communication and behavioral analysis. Traditional standardized tests may be 
used, but many have limitations. Most standardized tests do not evaluate the pragmatic deficits 
that are typical of these social disorders. Because these clients often perform better in struc-
tured environments, some may perform within normal expectations during formal testing even 
though they demonstrate functional communication deficits in nonstructured situations.
Specific strategies for assessing clients with ASD or SCD include:
 t Interview teachers, parents, caregivers, and others who spend significant time with 
the client.
 t Consult with other members of the multidisciplinary team. Review school records 
and medical records. Review cognitive assessment results obtained by a psychologist 
or psychiatrist.
 t Rule out hearing problems, or determine the degree to which hearing problems are 
contributing to the overall behaviors.
 t Obtain communication samples in a variety of settings. Include one-on-one settings 
and group settings.
 t Assess the client during play situations
 t Take note of inappropriate physical behaviors
 t Consider the client‚Äôs development of theory of mind
Theory of mind (ToM) is a person‚Äôs ability to understand that people engage in mental 
processes, such as cognitive knowledge and emotion, separate from his or her own processes. 
More generally stated, it is an ability to ‚Äúread another‚Äôs mind.‚Äù Individuals with ASD or SCD 
may have particular delays and deficits in the development of ToM. Normal developmental 
milestones of ToM are presented in Table 9-4.

It is necessary to obtain samples of the client‚Äôs communicative behaviors in a variety of 
clinical and extra-clinical situations. These suggestions may help to elicit certain targeted 
responses:
 t Have the client assemble a simple puzzle. Before giving him or her the puzzle,  
remove one piece and replace it with a piece that is obviously from a different puzzle.
 t Spin a top; when it stops spinning, hand it to the client.
 t Place a desirable object out of the client‚Äôs reach.
 t Intentionally fall off your chair.
 t When the client is engaged in something interesting, change the scene suddenly by 
taking away the interesting object and offering a new one.
 t Place an object on the edge of a table where it might easily fall off.
 t Open a jar of bubbles, blow a few, then close the jar and hand it to the client.
 t Show pictures of people who are expressing different emotions. Ask what the people 
are feeling.
 t Play a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs pretend‚Äù game.
 t Have the client make up a story. It may be helpful to offer an opening sentence  
(e.g., ‚ÄúTwo brothers were lying in their beds, when suddenly they heard a loud noise‚Äù).
 t Have the client ‚Äúread‚Äù a wordless, plot-based picture book. Ask the client to explain 
and predict events.
 t Have the client interpret video stories that have music and sound effects, but no  
spoken words.

Form 9-2, ‚ÄúBehavioral Analysis Worksheet,‚Äù is helpful for analyzing communicative be-
haviors in a variety of settings. A clinician, parent, teacher, or daycare provider can complete 
the form, or another person involved in the child‚Äôs life. It is helpful to obtain informa-
tion from a variety of settings using a different form to analyze each situation. It may also 
be helpful to video-record samples when possible. Audiotaped samples are less desirable  
because nonverbal aspects of communication are not recorded. 
Form 9-3, ‚ÄúAssessment for Autism Spectrum Disorder,‚Äù is provided to help clinicians as-
sess clients with possible autism spectrum disorder. It is crucial to be thorough and thought-
ful before making a positive diagnosis. Some behaviors may seem a bit ‚Äúoff ‚Äù but may not 
justify a diagnosis of ASD. Consider the following:
 t Are the behaviors clearly atypical?
 t Can the behaviors be otherwise explained (e.g., physical, developmental, or intellec-
tual explanation)?
 t Do the behaviors occur regularly and in multiple settings? (This is not a determiner, 
but is an important consideration.)
 t Are there multiple examples of a particular behavior?
 t How persistent and frequent are the behaviors?
 t Are there behaviors that occurred in the past but have since diminished or disappeared? 
(These are acceptable for positive diagnosis unless accounted for by normal development)
Clients who demonstrate atypical social behaviors but do not qualify for a diagnosis of 
ASD may qualify for a diagnosis of CSD. Form 9-4, ‚ÄúAssessment for Social (Pragmatic) 
Communication Disorder,‚Äù is provided to help with this determination. 
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
This chapter provided an overview of assessment procedures for autism spectrum disorder 
and social communication disorder. In some cases, behaviors of each condition are similar 
and overlap. However, these disorders are separate and distinct conditions. It is important 
to know the criteria for making an accurate diagnosis and thoroughly consider alternative 
diagnoses before assigning either diagnostic label to a client.

Some individuals are severely limited in their ability to communicate verbally, due to 
 cognitive disabilities or physical impairments. These clients are often candidates for aug-
mentative or alternative communication (AAC). AAC is a communication system that 
compensates for impairments and disabilities of clients with severe expressive commu-
nication disorders. There are a variety of AAC systems available, ranging from inexpen-
sive, low-technology options such as sign language or communication boards, to costly, 
high-technology communication devices using synthesized speech output. An AAC  system 
may be needed temporarily or permanently, depending on the client‚Äôs individual abilities 
and prognosis.

AUGMENTATIVE 
OR ALTERNATIVE 
COMMUNICATION
CHAPTER 10 Assessment for Augmentative or Alternative Communication (AAC) 
Client conditions that may warrant use of an AAC device are not limited to but include 
the following:
 t Severe aphasia
 t Severe apraxia
 t Intellectual disability
 t Cerebral palsy
 t Down syndrome
 t Parkinson‚Äôs disease
 t Traumatic brain injury
 t Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
 t Multiple sclerosis
 t Autism spectrum disorder
 t Alzheimer‚Äôs disease
 t Vocal surgery
 t Intubation
 t Limited English proficiency
A speech-language evaluation can determine whether AAC will be beneficial and what type 
of AAC system will be most appropriate for a client. When completing an evaluation of clients 
with a severe expressive impairment, the evaluation process needs to be modified to accommo-
date the client‚Äôs language and physical limitations. The evaluation typically involves consulting 
a team of professionals, such as physicians, therapists, psychologists, social workers, and teachers, 
who can provide valuable information to help the clinician make the most appropriate assess-
ment decisions. The assessment of clients for AAC generally includes four broad areas:
 t Determining the client‚Äôs communicative needs
 t Assessing the client‚Äôs sensory and motor abilities
 t Assessing the client‚Äôs language and cognitive abilities
 t Predicting the most suitable AAC system
When determining the client‚Äôs communicative needs, consider the client‚Äôs current com-
munication system, how effective that system is, what kind of success or failure the client 
has experienced with other systems, and what communicative situations and messages are 
typical for the client. This information can be gathered by interviewing the client as well 
as other caregivers who interact with the client regularly, especially parents and teachers. 
The assessment environment needs to be as natural as possible, mimicking what the client 
experiences during routine day-to-day activity. Glennen and DeCoste (1997) have devised 
an assessment worksheet that is helpful for evaluating a nonverbal client‚Äôs communicative 
needs. We have adapted it and reprinted it in Form 10-1, ‚ÄúAugmentative and Alternative 
Communication Information and Needs Assessment.‚Äù

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
ASSESSING SENSORY AND MOTOR CAPABILITIES
A client with limited verbal skills may have severe sensory or motor impairments that will 
need to be identified in order to make the most appropriate assessment decisions and AAC 
recommendations. It is important to modify test administrations to accommodate certain 
deficits, and to carefully consider the client‚Äôs abilities and disabilities when selecting an AAC 
system. The specific sensory and motor abilities to consider are: 
 t positioning
 t hearing
 t visual tracking and scanning
 t motor dexterity
During the assessment, position the client so that success in completing evaluative tasks 
is maximized. Pillows, wedges, foam rolls, or other support structures are sometimes helpful 
for achieving optimal positioning. Consider whether the client can position him- or herself 
or if restraints are needed. Also note whether the client is able to walk or is confined to a 
wheelchair. Various AAC systems accommodate a variety of user postures and positions.
The client‚Äôs visual tracking and scanning abilities also need to be considered. Visual 
tracking refers to the ability to watch an object or person move through more than one visual 
plane, and visual scanning refers to the ability to look for and locate an object among several 
other objects. Both skills will have an impact on assessment administration and recommen-
dations for AAC. Evaluate the client‚Äôs ability to visually track vertically, horizontally, and 
diagonally in two directions. Evaluate the client‚Äôs ability to visually scan words, objects, and 
symbols that may be used in an AAC system. Use a variety of stimulus items and include 
repeated trials. Also determine:
 t Whether the client can visually focus on an object
 t If the eyes move in a smooth, continuous motion
 t If nystagmus (oscillating movement of the eyeball) is present
 t Whether there are areas of visual neglect
 t If the eyes move together
 t At what rate the client tracks or scans (e.g., slowly, quickly, inconsistently)
 t The distance from the face the item needs to be to successfully view it
 t Where the client begins tracking or searching for objects (e.g., at midline, to the 
right, to the left, up, down)
 t Whether there is an identifiable pattern of scanning
 t The number of items the client is able to scan
Form 10-2, ‚ÄúVisual Scanning and Tracking Checklist,‚Äù is provided to help evaluate a 
client‚Äôs visual skills for the assessment for AAC.
Hearing acuity becomes particularly important if visual skills are deficient because many 
AAC devices have auditory scan features that clients with adequate hearing can access.  
Assessment of hearing is usually straightforward, and an audiologist with or without AAC 
experience can evaluate hearing abilities.

AUGMENTATIVE 
OR ALTERNATIVE 
COMMUNICATION
CHAPTER 10 Assessment for Augmentative or Alternative Communication (AAC) 
The evaluation process also includes a determination of the client‚Äôs motor abilities and 
deficits and how they will impact the usefulness of various AAC systems. Specific consider-
ations include:
 t The primary medical diagnosis
 t The presence of abnormal reflexes or tremor
 t How easily and how much the client fatigues
 t Loss of use of one or both hands
To use certain AAC systems, a client must be able to use some part of the body, prefera-
bly a hand, to produce voluntary, controlled, and consistent movements. If physical disability 
precludes the use of either hand, the head and chin, feet, knees, elbows, or other body part 
could possibly be used. Even controlled eye blinks or movements of the tongue have been 
used to access AAC devices.
ASSESSING LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE SKILLS
The assessment of language and cognitive skills is important for determining current levels 
of expressive and receptive abilities, understanding how the client perceives the world, and 
accurately predicting the most suitable AAC system to maximize the client‚Äôs communica-
tion. To determine cognitive levels, make observations about the client‚Äôs abilities and deficits 
in the following areas:
 t Alertness: Note whether the client is aware of his or her surroundings and if the client is 
oriented to time and space. The Rancho Los Amigos Levels of Cognitive Functioning 
(described in Chapter 13) is often used to assign or describe general levels of alertness.
 t Fatigue level
 t Attention span: Determine how long the client can attend to an activity or 
conversation.
 t Knowledge of ‚Äúcause and effect‚Äù: Note whether the client understands the concept that 
one behavior causes another, such as activating a switch causes a tape recorder to play 
music.
 t Symbolic representation skills: Note whether the client recognizes symbols, such as 
pictures of common objects, and is able to correlate pictures with real objects. Also 
determine the client‚Äôs reading and writing skills.
 t Memory skills
Also important is knowledge of the client‚Äôs receptive and expressive language abilities. 
Clearly, the method of assessing language will have to be modified to accommodate physical 
and verbal disabilities. For example, the clinician may need to allow the client to use eye gaze 
in place of pointing when administering certain tests. Client-specific stimulus activities may 
need to be created in order to elicit desired responses. For example, to assess the client‚Äôs abil-
ity to follow simple or complex commands, present directives that the client is motorically 
capable of doing. Note whether comprehension occurs with verbal direction only or with 
verbal direction accompanied by gesture.

Some of the assessment materials presented in Chapter 5, Assessment Procedures  
Common to Most Communicative Disorders, and Chapter 7, Assessment of Language in 
Children, in this resource manual can also be adapted.
The client‚Äôs ability to identify objects and pictures will need to be known prior to admin-
istering certain language assessments. This will help determine whether incorrect responses 
are truly language based or simply due to physical limitations. The clinician can then pro-
ceed with more complex communicative tasks that will help in the selection of an appropri-
ate AAC system based on the client‚Äôs language, cognition, sensory skills, and motor skills. 
During the assessment, determine whether the client can associate icons with real objects 
and concepts, use multiple icons to convey a message (e.g., ‚ÄúI want‚Äù ‚Äúto eat‚Äù ‚Äúsome cereal‚Äù), 
and recognize categories of icons, pictures, or objects. Also assess the client‚Äôs ability to read 
and write. Take note of the size and position of the stimulus materials presented.
DETERMINING THE MOST APPROPRIATE AAC SYSTEM
Once the assessment information is gathered and evaluated, recommendations can be 
made regarding the type of AAC system that may be most appropriate to meet the client‚Äôs 
needs. This is a complex decision, and the recommendation should be made by an indi-
vidual, or team of individuals, with knowledge of and experience with the various types of 
AAC systems and devices available. Often, several options can be presented. Even with 
the most carefully considered decision, field testing will be necessary. Judgments should 
be made concerning:
 t The appropriateness of the AAC system
 t The client‚Äôs proficiency in using the AAC system
 t The client‚Äôs progress in developing communication skills
 t The proficiency of the client‚Äôs communication partners in utilizing the AAC system
Types of AAC system options vary widely. For example, consider these AAC systems 
that range from free and simplistic to expensive and sophisticated:
 t Body language, including gestures, mime, and sign language
 t Pen and paper
 t Communication boards or books

Apps for AAC
An iPad or other tablet can be a very desirable AAC device. These devices are relatively in-
expensive and easy to transport, and the clinician can select apps appropriate to the client‚Äôs 
current age and changing needs. Most apps are customizable, allowing the user to input the 
most relevant content, determine the complexity of the user experience, and add personal 
photos and messages. Some apps that are useful for AAC include:
 t ‚ÄúAutisMate‚Äù by SpecialNeedsWare
 t ‚ÄúGoTalk Now‚Äù by Attainment Company
 t ‚ÄúLAMP Words for Life‚Äù by Prentke Romich Company
 t ‚ÄúMy First AAC‚Äù by NCSOFT
 t ‚ÄúMy Talk Tools‚Äù by 2nd Half Enterprises LLC
 t ‚ÄúPredictable‚Äù by Therapy Box Limited
 t ‚ÄúProloquo2Go‚Äù by AssistiveWare
 t ‚ÄúSonoflex‚Äù by Tobii Technology
 t ‚ÄúSpeak for Yourself ‚Äù by Speak for Yourself LLC
 t ‚ÄúSPEAKall!‚Äù by SPEAK MODalities LLC
 t ‚ÄúTouchChat‚Äù by Silver Kite
 t ‚ÄúVerbally‚Äù by Intuary
For most clients, it is wise to make the iPad a dedicated communication device. Avoid 
using the same iPad for games, music, videos, or other entertainment, as these can be dis-
tracting for the user. 
The selection of the most beneficial AAC system for a client is an ongoing process and 
is usually not completed during a single evaluation. There are many factors to consider,  
including the client‚Äôs proficiency at using a particular system, the client‚Äôs willingness to use it, 
and changes in the client‚Äôs disability, needs, and maturation over time. Commercially available 
tests that are useful for initial evaluation and subsequent ongoing assessment include:
 t INteraction CHecklist for Augmentative Communication (Bolton & Dashiell, 1998)
 t Lifespace Access Profile: Assistive Technology Assessment & Planning for Individuals with 
Severe or Multiple Disabilities (Williams, Stemach, Wolfe, & Stanger, 1995)
 t Test of Aided-Communication Symbol Performance (Bruno, 2010)
Probably the ultimate consideration in selecting AAC is the client‚Äôs desire and willingness to 
use it. A recommended device may be seen as the answer to a client‚Äôs communicative needs and 
have the enthusiastic support of the clinician, the client‚Äôs family, teachers, and other communi-
cative partners. However, if the client resists or rejects a device, it will serve as nothing more than 
a futile (and perhaps expensive) undertaking. Counseling, ongoing assessment, and alternative 
means of communication may need to be offered until an accepted system is found.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Augmentative or alternative communication may be indicated to improve the functional 
communication of severely impaired clients. This chapter provided an overview of assess-
ment procedures and considerations for clients who may benefit from AAC. Selection of an 
AAC system is an ongoing process that must consider a client‚Äôs current needs and abilities.

luent speech flows in a rhythmic, smooth, and effortless manner. Disfluencies are dis-
ruptions of fluid speech. All speakers experience moments of disfluency. It is normal to 
occasionally repeat a sound or word, pause briefly mid-utterance, or interject extra syllables 
such as ‚Äúuh‚Äù while speaking. It is not normal for disfluencies to handicap a speaker to the 
point of impairing communication or causing anxiety in the speaker or listener. When eval-
uating a client for a stuttering or cluttering disorder, the speech-language pathologist must 
consider many factors and discern whether the presenting problem is a disorder or a case of 
normal disfluency.

STUTTERING  
AND CLUTTERING
CHAPTER 11 Assessment of Stuttering and Cluttering 
DEFINING STUTTERING
Stuttering is perhaps the oldest known communicative disorder, and the most familiar 
among the lay population.1 Most people are aware of celebrities or others who struggle with 
a stuttering disorder. Over the years, stuttering has been widely researched and many theo-
ries of etiology exist. Yet, despite these facts, the cause of stuttering remains somewhat of a 
mystery. We do know that:
 t Stuttering can develop for no apparent reason.
 t Stuttering is more common among boys than girls.
 t Stuttering is more common among highly sensitive children.
 t Some people are genetically predisposed to stutter.
 t The onset of stuttering usually occurs before the age of 6.
 t Most children experience a period of disfluent speech between the ages of 2 and 5; 
some outgrow it whereas others do not.
 t Stuttering is variable. A person may be completely fluent in one situation and  
extremely disfluent in another.
 t Some disfluency types are more indicative of a fluency disorder than others.
 t Stuttering causes personal grief, fear, and frustration.
Disfluencies are often categorized by type. The disfluency types that are most typically 
associated with a stuttering disorder are part-word repetitions, monosyllabic whole-word 
repetitions, sound prolongations, silent pauses (blocks), and broken words. In contrast, the 
disfluency types that are more frequently associated with normal disfluency are interjections, 
revisions, multisyllabic whole-word repetitions, and phrase repetitions. The major disfluency 
types are as follows (from Hegde & Davis, 2005, p. 416):
Repetitions
Part-word repetitions 
‚ÄúWhat t-t-t-time is it?‚Äù
Whole-word repetitions 
‚ÄúWhat-what-what are you doing?‚Äù
Phrase repetitions 
‚ÄúI want to-I want to-I want to do it.‚Äù
Prolongations
Sound/syllable prolongations 
‚ÄúLlllllet me do it.‚Äù
Silent prolongations 
 A struggling attempt to say a word when 
there is no sound.
 1. This chapter focuses on developmental stuttering. Some researchers report two types of acquired stuttering: neurogenic stuttering 
(resulting from a neurological insult) and psychogenic stuttering (resulting from a psychologically traumatic event).

SPEECH SAMPLING
The most important procedure for any evaluation of stuttering is a speech sample. Speech 
samples should be gathered from more than one session and, if possible, from more than 
one setting in order to obtain the most representative sample possible. Attempt to obtain 
samples that contain the fewest disfluencies, the most disfluencies, and the typical number 
of disfluencies present in the client‚Äôs speech. Obtain samples from a variety of speaking situ-
ations, including oral reading, dialogue, and monologue. Also obtain samples when speaking 
to different audiences, including family members, friends, peers, and superiors. The collec-
tion of an adequate sample is critical because it is the primary basis on which most analyses 
and judgments about fluency are made.
Collect speech samples from:
 t The clinic or testing site
 t Outside the assessment area but still in proximity to it
 t Home
 t Classroom
 t Playground
 t Work environment
 t Other places the client spends time and interacts with others

STUTTERING  
AND CLUTTERING
CHAPTER 11 Assessment of Stuttering and Cluttering 
If it is not feasible to collect samples from different settings, ask the client or a parent to 
provide recorded samples for analysis. Because stuttering is variable, it is important to ask 
how typical the samples are. It could be quite embarrassing and damaging to one‚Äôs credibil-
ity to make judgments and recommendations, only to learn later that the client‚Äôs stuttering 
behaviors were uncharacteristic during the assessment.
Specific procedures and stimulus materials for collecting a speech sample were presented 
in Chapter 5. For the assessment of stuttering, the following materials from Chapter 5 may 
be particularly helpful:
 t Pictures
 t Narratives
 t Reading Passages
 t Syllable-by-Syllable Stimulus Phrases
After obtaining thorough and representative samples of the client‚Äôs speech, the analysis 
phase of the assessment can begin. Specifically, determine:
 t The total number of disfluencies
 t Frequencies of different types of disfluencies
 t Disfluency indexes
 t The duration of individual instances of disfluency
 t Speech rate
 t Types and frequencies of accessory behaviors
DISFLUENCY INDEXES
A disfluency index refers to the percentage of disfluent speech present in a speech sam-
ple. Disfluency indexes should be determined in several different environments (the 
therapy room, outside, at home, at work, etc.), within different modes of speech (reading, 
spontaneous speech, etc.), and across more than one assessment session. The ‚ÄúFluency 
Charting Grid,‚Äù Form 11-1, and ‚ÄúFrequency Count for Disfluencies,‚Äù Form 11-2, are 
methods for identifying and quantifying disfluencies. Use Form 11-1 to count the total 
number of disfluent and fluent productions and, for more sophisticated charting, to code 
each disfluency type. Form 11-2 can be used to tally occurrences of each type of dis-
fluency. Form 11-2 may be preferable for charting short samples, or for more informal 
charting such as screenings.
Form 11-3, ‚ÄúCalculating the Disfluency Index,‚Äù is helpful for assessing fluency. When 
determining a disfluency index, count each repetition of a sound, part of a word, whole word, 
or phrase only once. For example, ba-ba-ba-ba-ball is one disfluency, I-want-I want-I want 
to go is one disfluency, and go-go-go-away is also one disfluency.2
 2.  There are times when counting the number of repetitions per disfluency provides useful information. In the examples just 
provided, calculate the average number of repetitions per disfluency. But for calculating a disfluency index, do not count every 
repetition.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
The Total Disfluency Index reflects all disfluencies produced by the client. For example, 
consider a 500-word sample with the following number of disfluencies:
 
 75 repetitions
 
 50 pauses
 
 25 sound prolongations
 
150 total disfluencies
To calculate the Total Disfluency Index:
1. Count the total number of words in the speech sample (500 in this example).
2. Count the total number of disfluencies (150).
3. Divide the total disfluencies by the total words. In this example: 150 ! 500 " 0.30.
4. Change to a percentage: 0.30 " 30% Total Disfluency Index.
Separate indexes can also be determined for individual disfluency types. For example, to 
calculate a Total Repetitions Index (using the previous example data):
1. Count the total number of words in the speech sample (500 in this example).
2. Count the number of specified disfluencies (75 repetitions in this example).
3. Divide the total specified disfluency (repetitions) by the total words. In this example: 
75 ! 500 " 0.15.
4. Change to a percentage: 0.15 " 15% Total Repetitions Index.
Indexes for any disfluency type can be calculated using the same method.
A third type of disfluency index reflects the percentage of each disfluency type based on 
the Total Disfluency Index. For this calculation, base the computation on the total number 
of disfluencies. Using the same example:
1. Count the total number of disfluencies in the speech sample (150 in this example).
2. Count the number of specified disfluencies (75 repetitions).
3. Divide the total specified disfluency (repetitions) by the total disfluencies. In this  
example: 75 ! 150 " 0.50.
4. Change to a percentage: 0.50 " 50% of all disfluencies present were repetitions.
Occasionally, a client will exhibit very few disfluencies, resulting in a normal disfluency in-
dex. However, some of the disfluencies exhibited will be long in duration and therefore indicate 
a possible fluency disorder. In these cases, time the duration of the disfluencies and determine 
a mean duration of disfluency. Time each disfluency with a stopwatch. Pauses or prolongations 
are most commonly measured, but the duration of repetitions can also be timed. For example, 
10 disfluencies resulting in a total of 42 seconds yields an average duration of 4.2 seconds.
ACCESSORY BEHAVIORS
People who stutter often develop accessory behaviors, also called secondary behaviors in re-
sponse to, or in anticipation of stuttering. These behaviors are reinforced and become ha-
bitual when the speaker has initial success in maneuvering out of or postponing disfluent

CHAPTER 11 Assessment of Stuttering and Cluttering 
speech. Accessory behaviors are learned responses to stuttering. They are present only during 
disfluent speech, and the speaker may or may not be aware of these behaviors. Although 
such behaviors are common, not all people who stutter exhibit them. These behaviors may 
include:
 t Associated motor behaviors
 t Physiologic responses
 t Avoidance
 t Expectancy
Associated motor behaviors are extraneous body movements. These visible displays 
of tension usually involve parts of the oralfacial mechanism and may include behaviors 
such as eye blinking, wrinkling the forehead, frowning, distorting the mouth, moving 
the head, and quivering the nostrils. Sometimes they include movements of body parts 
that are not normally associated with speech, such as movements of the arms, hands, 
legs, feet, or torso.
During the assessment, note all unusual movements the client exhibits. Form 11-4, 
‚ÄúAssessment of Associated Motor Behaviors,‚Äù is designed to help identify these extraneous 
movements. Note that the form lists the most common behaviors; it is not an exhaustive list 
of all the possible behaviors clients may exhibit. Once the behaviors are identified, chart their 
frequency in the same manner other disfluencies are charted.
A client may also exhibit abnormal physiological behaviors associated with stuttering. 
These may affect respiratory, phonatory, articulatory, and prosodic aspects of speech pro-
duction. Form 11-5, ‚ÄúAssessment of Physiological Factors Associated with Stuttering,‚Äù is 
provided to help identify several physiological factors that may be observed during an assess-
ment. Clinicians need to carefully examine whether these factors are present during fluent 
and disfluent speech or only during disfluencies.
Avoidance is a learned response to unpleasant stimuli. Just as people learn to avoid touch-
ing a hot stove because it is painful to get burned, many people who stutter learn to avoid 
certain sounds, words, or speaking situations that are especially difficult for them. Stuttering 
clients occasionally circumlocute‚Äîor talk around a subject‚Äîto avoid disfluencies. Specifi-
cally, some stutterers tend to avoid difficult:
 t Sounds
 t Words
 t Topics
 t People (e.g., employer, teacher, strangers)
 t Situations (e.g., ordering in a restaurant, talking on the telephone)
 t Communicative events (e.g., public speaking, speaking with members of the  
opposite sex)
During the assessment, pay particular attention to avoidance behaviors. Ask probing 
questions during the interview and observe the client‚Äôs speech during the speech sample.
Avoidance behaviors can be described as primary or secondary. Primary avoidances 
refer to the client‚Äôs attempts to alter verbal output. Secondary avoidances are acts of 
reducing or ceasing verbal output. Examples of primary and secondary avoidances are 
provided next.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
Primary Avoidances
 t Starters: using words, sounds, gestures, or rituals to initiate speech.
 t Postponements: silences (e.g., pretending to think), ritualistic acts (e.g., lip licking),  
or verbal stalling.
 t Retrials: repeating a fluent utterance to ‚Äúhurdle‚Äù a feared word or phrase.
 t Circumlocutions: sound, word, or phrase substitutions.
 t Antiexpectancies: altering the communicative text by speaking with an accent,  
imitating someone else‚Äôs voice, overemphasizing articulation, speaking rhythmically, 
whispering, or singing.
Secondary Avoidances
 t Reducing verbal output or not talking at all.
 t Relying on others to communicate for them.
Expectancy, also known as anticipation, is the expectation of a disfluency before it 
occurs. Expectancies can occur for sounds, words, people, or specific situations. Some cli-
ents respond to expectancy by ‚Äúpushing forward‚Äù into the disfluency. Others respond with 
avoidance behaviors. Obtain information about expectancy by observing and listening 
during speech tasks and interviews. Ask the client to report when he or she experiences 
expectancy.
SPEECH RATE
Specific procedures for assessing rate of speech are provided in Chapter 5. Assessing speech 
rate is an especially important element of the evaluation of stuttering. Evaluate:
 t Overall rate including disfluencies
 t Normal rate excluding disfluencies
These two measures often produce very different results. For example, a person who stut-
ters may produce only a few words per minute when both fluent and disfluent segments are 
measured. But if only segments of fluent speech are analyzed, the same person may actually 
exhibit a fast rate of speech. A rapid speech rate, which can go undetected if only the overall 
rate is assessed, may be a major contributor to the fluency disorder.
ASSESSING FEELINGS AND ATTITUDES
Stuttering is a debilitating handicap that can cause feelings of great pain, anguish, and frus-
tration. The person who stutters may be corrected, teased, ridiculed, mocked, chastised, 
avoided, isolated, pitied, or scorned because of the speech disorder. He or she is likely to 
experience negative feelings and attitudes as a result of the communication difficulty.
Erickson (1969) developed the S-Scale, a 39-item form used to assess stutterers‚Äô attitudes 
about various speaking situations. This scale was later modified into a 24-item scale by

Andrews and Cutler (1974) so that it could be readministered across time to assess progress. 
Researchers have reported conflicting results from studies of the S-Scale and its modified 
form. One criticism is that the items are not exclusive to stutterers and, therefore, they are 
not fully discriminative between people with normal and disordered fluency. However, peo-
ple who stutter answer ‚Äútrue‚Äù to items on the scale more often than people who do not stutter.
Understanding a client‚Äôs feelings and attitudes about his or her stuttering behavior may 
be helpful for making decisions about the client‚Äôs care. Administering the modified S-Scale 
is useful for gathering this information. It is provided in Form 11-6, ‚ÄúThe Modified S-Scale.‚Äù  
For young children, the form can be adapted and completed by a parent by changing I to my 
child. The parent should answer from the child‚Äôs point of view.
Because parents are likely to have fears, anxieties, and concerns of their own about a 
child‚Äôs stuttering pattern, it is helpful to consider the attitudes and feelings of the parent as 
well as the child. A separate form, the ‚ÄúParental Speech Chart,‚Äù Form 11-8, can be com-
pleted to assess level of concern from the parent‚Äôs point of view.
Bray, Kehle, Lawless, and Theodore (2003) used a form similar to the Modified S-Scale 
that is specifically for adolescent-age clients. Their ‚ÄúAdolescent Communication Question-
naire‚Äù is provided in Form 11-7.
CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSING STUTTERING
Authorities do not agree on what constitutes a stuttering disorder versus normal nonfluent 
speech. This makes it difficult in some cases to diagnose. Clinicians must use professional 
judgment and experience to make an appropriate diagnosis. There are several factors to 
consider. A diagnosis of stuttering disorder is often made if one or more of these conditions 
exist:
 t The client has a Total Disfluency Index of 10% or greater.
 t The client‚Äôs disfluency indexes for repetitions, prolongations, and intralexical pauses 
are 3% or greater.
 t The duration of disfluencies is 1 second or longer.
 t The most prevalent disfluency types are part-word repetitions, monosyllabic whole-
word repetitions, sound prolongations, silent pauses, or broken words.
 t Secondary accessory behaviors are present.
 t The client‚Äôs (or parent‚Äôs) degree of concern is significant.
Making a diagnosis is sometimes more complicated when the client is a young child. 
Most clinicians agree that normally developing children experience a period of nonfluent 
speech. This typically occurs during the preschool years, between the ages of 2 and 5. Unfor-
tunately there are no sure indicators that a child will naturally outgrow stuttering behavior. 
Professionals have varying opinions about diagnosing a fluency disorder and recommending 
therapy for children who stutter.
In general, a stuttering disorder requiring intervention is more likely if:
 t The child is male.
 t Stuttering has continued for 6 months or longer.

 t Onset of stuttering occurred before the child‚Äôs third birthday.
 t The child demonstrates associated motor behaviors.
 t Other speech or language disorders are present.
 t The child or child‚Äôs family have strong fears or concerns about stuttering.
When assessing a nonfluent child, it is also important to consider his or her language, 
articulation, and oral-motor skills. In some cases, an apparent ‚Äústuttering disorder‚Äù may ac-
tually be a secondary behavior of another communicative disorder.
Speech-language pathologists rely on experience, knowledge of stuttering, and profes-
sional judgment to make diagnoses and recommendations. Commercial assessment instru-
ments are also available to assist in the assessment process. These include:
 t Behavior Assessment Battery (BAB) for School-Age Children Who Stutter (Brutten & 
Vanryckeghem, 2007)
 t Stuttering Prediction Instrument for Young Children (Riley, 1981)
 t Stuttering Severity Instrument (SSI-4) (Riley, 2008)
 t Test of Childhood Stuttering (TOCS) (Gillam, Logan, & Pearson, 2009)
STIMULABILITY
Stimulability of fluency refers to a client‚Äôs responsiveness to techniques that improve fluency. 
Clinicians typically elicit fluent speech by using the same techniques that are used in treat-
ment. Several of these techniques are described in Table 11-1.
Imitation and adequate instruction are key elements to successful stimulation. These 
techniques are used in combination with response-contingent management (specifically, 
TABLE 11-1 
Fluency Modification Techniques
TECHNIQUE
DESCRIPTION
Prolonged speech
The clinician seeks to prolong the client‚Äôs duration of sounds, usually 
with a slow, well-controlled transition between sounds and syllables.
Gentle onset/airflow
The stutterer is directed to initiate vocalization with a stable egressive 
airflow and a gentle onset of phonation.
Reduced speech rate
The stutterer maintains a reduced rate of speech, usually beginning 
with single-word productions and advancing to longer, more 
complex utterances. Normal phrase boundaries and prosodic 
features are maintained.
Reduced articulatory 
effort
The client minimizes articulatory tension by bringing the specific 
articulatory patterns of ongoing speech into conscious attention.

positive or negative reinforcement of desired responses and punishment of undesired re-
sponses). Stimulation usually begins at the single-word level and increases in incremental 
steps. The ‚ÄúSyllable-by-Syllable Stimulus Phrases‚Äù in Chapter 5 are especially useful for 
assessing stimulability of fluency in increasingly longer phrases.
CLUTTERING
Cluttering is a fluency disorder that often coexists with stuttering, but can also be present on 
its own. The characteristics of cluttering include:
 t Rapid speech rate, which negatively affects other aspects of communication
 t Excessive disfluencies (normal nonfluencies predominate)
 t Coexisting disorders of language and/or articulation
 t Monotone voice
 t Indistinct ‚Äúmumbling‚Äù speech; sound distortions and omissions are common.
 t Errors present in connected speech are less pronounced or not present during  
single-word articulation tests or during more slowly produced speech segments.
 t Telescoped errors‚Äîfor example, statistical may become stacal, or refrigerator may  
become reor.
 t Spoonerisms, in which sounds are transposed in a word, phrase, or sentence‚Äîfor  
example, hit the books may be produced as bit the hooks, or many people think so may  
become many thinkle peep so.
 t Lack of awareness of the speech disorder, at least initially. Clients who clutter are 
sometimes genuinely surprised when the disorder is diagnosed or when other people 
do not understand them.
 t Short attention span, restlessness, and hyperactivity
 t Poor handwriting
 t Poor thought organization and expression
 t Lack of rhythm or musical ability
 t Difficulty in treatment. Establishing and maintaining a slower speech rate and gener-
alizing treatment behaviors into everyday speech are often difficult
Table 11-2 describes differential characteristics of stuttering and cluttering.
Assessment
Because cluttering affects all four primary aspects of communication‚Äîarticulation, language, 
voice, and fluency‚Äîits assessment must also include each of these areas. The procedures that 
usually provide the best information for diagnosing cluttering are articulation testing and 
spontaneous speech sampling. A thorough examination of language is also recommended.

The following procedures and stimulus materials may be helpful for completing an assess-
ment of cluttering:
 t ‚ÄúReading Passages‚Äù (Chapter 5)
 t ‚ÄúSpeech and Language Sampling‚Äù (Chapter 5)
 t ‚ÄúEvaluating Rate of Speech‚Äù (Chapter 5)
 t ‚ÄúDetermining Intelligibility‚Äù (Chapter 5)
 t ‚ÄúOrofacial Examination Form‚Äù (Form 5-1)
 t ‚ÄúDiadochokinetic Syllable Rates Worksheet‚Äù (Form 5-2)
 t ‚ÄúFormal Tests‚Äù (Chapter 6)
 t ‚ÄúComparison of Sound Errors From an Articulation Test and Connected Speech‚Äù 
(Form 6-1)
The ‚ÄúChecklist of Cluttering Characteristics,‚Äù Form 11-9, is designed to help compile 
and evaluate assessment findings. Normally, a cluttering client will not exhibit every associ-
ated characteristic. Consider the presenting behaviors in light of other assessment informa-
tion to make an accurate diagnosis. Also be aware that some cases of apraxia or stuttering 
resemble cluttering, at least initially. It is important to be familiar with the differentiating 
characteristics of each disorder.

CHAPTER 11 Assessment of Stuttering and Cluttering 
Stimulability
Once the cluttering behaviors are identified, it is important to see if the client can improve 
his or her speech. Two of the five techniques for eliciting improved fluency in Table 11-1 
are also useful for cluttering, specifically prolonged speech and reduced speech rate. These are 
useful because excessive speech rate is a primary problem with a cluttering pattern. Another 
technique is borrowed from dysarthria therapy. Called syllable-by-syllable attack, it empha-
sizes that the client correctly produce every syllable in an utterance (see Darley, Aronson, & 
Brown, 1975; Rosenbek & LaPointe, 1985). To accomplish this, the client usually reduces 
his or her speech rate.
Even though the cluttering client usually exhibits errors of articulation, language, and 
voice, stimulation of all these deficits may not need to be the primary focus of stimulability 
assessment. In many cases, reducing the speech rate to a slower, more manageable speed 
reduces or eliminates the effects of these secondary characteristics. As with other disorders, 
stimulability should start at the most simple level and incrementally increase in complexity. 
The ‚ÄúSyllable-by-Syllable Stimulus Phrases‚Äù in Chapter 5 are especially useful for assessing 
stimulability across different syllable lengths.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
The assessment of fluency disorders is an intriguing and challenging aspect of clinical work 
for speech-language pathologists. The behaviors exhibited vary considerably among individ-
ual clients, as do their reactions to these problems. The valid assessment of a fluency disorder 
is a prerequisite to effective clinical treatment. The clinician‚Äôs understanding of the disorder, 
the patterns exhibited, and the client‚Äôs (and caregiver‚Äôs) reaction all enter into the diagnostic 
process. The absence of accurate knowledge and information precludes, or at least reduces, 
the chances of effectively diagnosing and treating the disorder.

ocal production occurs via vibration of the vocal folds as air is pushed up by the respi-
ratory system and passes through the glottis. The umbrella term for a voice disorder is 
dysphonia (faulty phonation), or, in some situations, aphonia (no phonation). Features of the 
voice are pitch, quality, and loudness. Resonance is affected by conditions of the vocal tract. 
Features of resonance are nasal resonance and oral resonance. Disorders of voice and resonance 
are distinct, yet they are often addressed together in professional literature. Assessment pro-
cedures for both conditions are presented in this chapter because of the overlapping nature 
of portions of the assessment process. The chapter concludes with assessment procedures 
for two special populations that are associated with a voice or resonance disorder: alaryngeal 
clients and clients with cleft lip and/or palate.
Voice and resonance evaluation and management is a specialized science within our pro-
fession. A clinician should not enter into an evaluation without proper experience or super-
vision. This chapter is provided as a resource and aid; however, it is not possible to provide 
depth of information, or necessary training on specified equipment, in a text of this nature.

ANATOMY FOR VOICE AND RESONANCE
Healthy voice production requires normal and synchronized participation of the respiratory 
system (lungs, diaphragm, ribs, and abdominal and chest muscles), the vibratory system 
( larynx, vocal folds, and glottis), and the resonating system (pharyngeal, oral, and nasal cav-
ities). See Figure 12-1 for a pictorial representation of the voice mechanism. Figure 12-2 
shows normal vocal folds open and closed. Figure 12-3 shows some of the most common 
vocal fold pathologies.

VOICE AND  
RESONANCE
CHAPTER 12 Assessment of Voice and Resonance 
CATEGORIES OF VOICE DISORDERS
There are four primary categories of voice disorders, grouped according to etiology:
1. Functional disorders: nonorganic disorders that result from vocal misuse or abuse.  
The most common conditions are vocal nodules, contact ulcers, and granuloma.
2. Neurogenic disorders: organic disorders that result from illness, disease, or damage to 
the nervous system. Conditions may include partial or complete vocal fold paralysis, 
spasmodic dysphonia, and voice associated with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS).
3. Psychogenic disorders: disorders that result from psychological and emotional conflict 
such as extreme stress or anxiety. Resultant voice disorders may include tense voice, 
aphonia, and mutational falsetto.
4. Alaryngeal communication: voice production without a larynx, usually because of a tra-
cheostomy or because the larynx has been partially or completely removed. Commu-
nication options include artificial larynx, electrolarynx, and pseudoglottis.
It is important to realize that, in some situations, these categories may seem to overlap. For 
example, a speaker with a neurogenic disorder may misuse his or her voice in an effort to 
compensate for poor respiratory support, and thus develop a secondary functional voice 
disorder. Or a speaker may be distraught following a laryngectomy, adding an emotional 
component (know that the resultant voice disorder would not be considered a psychogenic 
disorder). Also, some conditions can occur in more than one category depending on etiol-
ogy. For example, aphonia could be caused by a functional disorder, psychogenic disorder, or 
alaryngeal communication.
THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM
Voice and resonance disorders are typically managed by a team. At minimum, the team 
consists of a laryngologist, the speech-language pathologist, and the client. Other members 
of the team may include a primary care physician, neurologist, allergist, gastroenterologist, 
pulmonologist, orthodontist, radiologist, plastic surgeon, psychologist, psychiatrist, nurse, 
audiologist, social worker, teacher, music or drama specialist, voice coach, family members, 
or others. Including the client as an integral member of the team is imperative. Without the 
client‚Äôs cooperation and participation during the diagnostic and decision-making period, 
progress with treatment will not be possible.
The role of the speech-language pathologist is primarily to describe and characterize 
the features of the voice, determine if the features differ from the norm, and, if a disor-
der is present, explore intervention approaches that will improve the client‚Äôs voice. The 
speech-language pathologist will also make recommendations and referrals as appropri-
ate. Many speech-language pathologists who specialize in disorders of voice physically 
share office space with laryngologists, providing an ideal environment for professional 
collaboration.

SCREENING
A screen for voice and resonance disorders can be accomplished with a few quick and easy 
tasks. For example, ask the client to:
 t Imitate words and phrases of varying lengths
 t Count to 20
 t Recite the alphabet
 t Read a short passage
 t Talk conversationally for a couple of minutes
 t Prolong the following vowels for 5 seconds each: \A\, \√∏\, \i\, \u\, \≈ì\.
 t Produce sustained /s/ and /z/ for calculation on an s/z ratio (described later in this chapter)
During the screen, listen carefully to the client‚Äôs resonance, tone, pitch, and loudness. Any 
perceived deviation from normal suggests that further evaluative measures should be pursued.
CLIENT HISTORY AND PRESENT CONCERNS
Thoroughly gathering historical information and evaluating a client‚Äôs current perceptions 
and concerns is an important aspect of a complete evaluation. Obtain copies of all relevant 
professional reports. In some situations, these reports will already be available. In other situ-
ations, the speech-language pathologist may need to make referrals for additional evaluation. 
In either case, a treatment program should not be initiated until all appropriate medical eval-
uations have been completed, as therapy may prove detrimental in some situations.
In addition to the standard case history queries, these issues or questions should be 
considered:
 t How is the client‚Äôs voice impacting his or her daily life?
 t Has there been previous medical or surgical treatment for a laryngeal pathology?
 t Has there been previous treatment for a voice or resonance disorder?
 t Are there craniofacial anomalies?
 t Has there been laryngeal trauma?
 t Does the client have a neurological condition?
 t Does the client have a hearing loss?
 t Has the client experienced a hormonal disturbance?
 t What ethnocultural variables might influence the client‚Äôs voice and resonance?
It is particularly helpful to understand how a client perceives his or her own voice. 
Form 12-1, ‚ÄúThe Voice Handicap Index (VHI),‚Äù was designed by a team of professionals 
to quantify the psychosocial consequences of voice disorders. It consists of three subscales: 
the functional prompts evaluate the impact of a person‚Äôs voice on daily activities, the emo-
tional prompts evaluate the client‚Äôs affective response to his or her voice, and the physical 
prompts evaluate the client‚Äôs own perceptions of vocal quality. Page 1 of Form 12-1 is the

questionnaire portion of the VHI and is to be given to the client to complete. Page 2 is for 
clinical use for calculating results. The data in Table 12-1 can be used to interpret findings.
Forms 12-2 and 12-3 offer checklists that are helpful for identifying behaviors that 
may be contributing to a voice disorder. Form 12-2, ‚ÄúVocally Abusive Behaviors Check-
list‚ÄîAdult,‚Äù is most appropriate for adults and Form 12-3, ‚ÄúVocally Abusive Behaviors  
Checklist‚ÄîChildren and Youth,‚Äù is for younger clients.
PERCEPTUAL AND INSTRUMENTAL EXAMINATION OF VOICE
The perceptual component of an evaluation is the somewhat subjective ‚Äúhuman‚Äù piece of the 
assessment. What does the voice sound like, and does it draw attention to itself in a negative 
way? On the other hand, instrumental examination provides the objective data that vali-
date and quantify perceptual judgments. Instruments provide acoustic, aerodynamic, and/or  
imaging-based analysis. Both perceptual and instrumental assessment measures are impor-
tant aspects of a complete evaluation.
For both perceptual and instrumental examination it is important to collect multiple rep-
resentative samples of the client‚Äôs speech. Specific procedures for collecting a speech sample 
were described in Chapter 5. The ‚ÄúConversation Starters for Eliciting a Speech-Language 
Sample,‚Äù ‚ÄúPictures,‚Äù ‚ÄúNarratives,‚Äù and ‚ÄúReading Passages‚Äù are possible resource materials. 
The clinician can also ask the client to perform serial tasks, such as count to 20, name the 
days of the week, name the months of the year, or recite the alphabet. Listen to and observe 
the client, and note the following:
 t Pitch
 t Intensity
 t Vocal quality
 t Vocal habits (including abusive behaviors)
 t Resonance
 t Respiratory support
 t Posture, tension, and behaviors

Use a high-quality audio-recording device, or, better, a video device so that behaviors can 
be heard and viewed. Ask the client to provide samples from other environments, such as the 
workplace, school, entertainment venues, and home. Do not delete files, as they are helpful 
for location comparisons and to assess changes over time.
Evaluation of Pitch
Pitch, or frequency, is expressed in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz) and is a measure of the 
speed of vocal fold vibration. Frequency is influenced by vocal fold mass, length, and tension. 
During an assessment, determine a client‚Äôs fundamental frequency, range, and best pitch.
The fundamental frequency (F0), also called habitual pitch, is the average pitch that a client 
uses during speaking and reading. Table 12-2 presents normal fundamental frequencies for 
males and females of various ages, and includes the approximated equivalent note value on 
a piano or pitch pipe.
Several methods exist for determining a client‚Äôs fundamental frequency. The most objec-
tive way is to use an assessment instrument or computer software program. If such a device 
is not available, analyze recorded samples of the client‚Äôs speech. Use a musical instrument

VOICE AND  
RESONANCE
CHAPTER 12 Assessment of Voice and Resonance 
(e.g., piano or pitch pipe) to match the client‚Äôs pitch at several different moments in the sam-
ple. An average can be approximated from those pitches. A quick way to estimate a client‚Äôs 
habitual pitch for screening purposes is to ask a yes-no question and have the client reply 
with ‚Äúmmm-hhmm‚Äù (yes) or ‚Äúhhmm-mmm‚Äù (no). The pitch the client uses for the ‚Äúmmm‚Äù 
syllable is often the client‚Äôs habitual pitch.
Also determine the client‚Äôs pitch range. Ask the client to phonate ‚Äúah‚Äù at a comfortable 
pitch and glissando up to the highest note possible. Identify the pitch at the top of the range. 
Repeat twice. To determine bottom of the range, ask the client to glissando down to the 
lowest note possible. The highest and lowest pitches elicited determine vocal range.
For most speakers, habitual pitch is also their best pitch. In some cases, however, a person 
may habitually speak at a frequency that is not ideal and may be abusive to vocal structures. 
During an assessment, explore pitches at which the client‚Äôs voice is least effortful and most 
natural sounding. As a general guideline, best pitch for a male speaker is approximately 25% 
above the lowest pitch in his range, and best pitch for a female is approximately 18% above 
the lowest pitch in her range.
Jitter, also called pitch perturbation, is a measure of the minuscule variations in fundamen-
tal frequency from cycle to cycle. Jitter is determined using sensitive instrumentation. Jitter 
values in normal voices range from 0.2% to 1%. Higher measurements indicate interference 
with vocal fold vibration.
Evaluation of Vocal Intensity
Vocal intensity, or loudness, is measured in decibels (dB). Vocal intensity is a reflection of 
the amplitude of vocal fold vibrations. The greater the amplitude, the greater the perceived 
loudness. Vocal intensity is controlled by the amount of airflow coming up from the lungs 
and the amount of resistance by the vocal folds to the airflow. Table 12-3 presents normal 
conversational intensity and range data.
Consider if the client‚Äôs habitual loudness is appropriate for the setting, and whether there 
is normal or abnormal variation in loudness levels used. Also assess the client‚Äôs ability to vary 
vocal intensity during informal tasks. Ask him or her to whisper, speak softly, speak loudly, 
and shout. To assess range, ask the client to count upward from one, starting with a soft voice 
and increasing vocal intensity with each number.
Shimmer, also called amplitude perturbation, is a measure of the miniscule variations in 
amplitude from cycle to cycle. Shimmer values below 0.5 dB are normal in the human voice. 
Like jitter, shimmer is measured using sensitive instrumentation.

Evaluation of Vocal Quality
Vocal qualities are the general characteristics of a person‚Äôs voice. Until recently, there was 
not a standardized process for perceptual assessment of vocal quality. In 2002, the American 
Speech-Hearing-Language Association (ASHA) formed a team of professionals to remedy 
the void. As a result, the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) was 
developed. It is reprinted in this text as Form 12-4.
The six standard attributes of vocal quality, as defined by the CAPE-V, are:
 t Overall severity: a global and integrated impression of voice deviance
 t Roughness: a perceived irregularity in the voicing source
 t Breathiness: audible air escape in the voice
 t Strain: a perception of excessive vocal effort; hyperfunction
 t Pitch: the perceptual correlate of fundamental frequency (Does the speaker‚Äôs voice 
sound too high or too low considering his or her gender, age, and culture?)
 t Loudness: the perceptual correlate of intensity (Does the speaker‚Äôs voice sound too 
soft or too loud considering his or her age, gender, and culture?)
Additional attributes may include:
 t Diplophonia: simultaneous production of two different pitches
 t Fry: a rhythmic creaking or popping quality that occurs below the lowest note of a 
speaker‚Äôs pitch range. It is normal at the end of phrases and sentences on occasion, 
but problematic if habitual.
 t Falsetto: the use of a pre-pubescent voice in adulthood
 t Asthenia: a weak, thin voice
 t Aphonia: absence of voice
 t Pitch instability: involuntary pitch changes
 t Tremor: a rhythmic fluctuation of vocal loudness and/or pitch
 t Wet/gurgling voice: a wet quality to the voice
Normal vocal quality is in the ears of the listener. There is huge variation in what is consid-
ered normal. In general, vocal quality is abnormal if it draws negative attention to itself and/or 
has a negative impact on the speaker‚Äôs daily life. Many qualities, such as mild roughness, are 
sometimes validated by society, but they can lead to significant functional vocal pathologies.
Assessing Respiratory Support for Speech
Good respiratory support is critical for normal vocal production. Some clients with voice 
disorders demonstrate poor breathing habits. During the assessment, observe the client‚Äôs 
respiratory behavior following instruction to ‚Äútake a deep breath‚Äù and during connected 
speech. Note the following:
 t Tension in upper chest, shoulders, face and/or neck
 t Shallow inhalation

Maximum Phonation Time
Maximum phonation time (MPT) is a measure of glottic efficiency. The sequence of admin-
istration is as follows:
1. Ask the client to take a deep breath and exhale ‚Äúah‚Äù (or other vowel) at a comfortable 
pitch and loudness, sustaining as long as possible. Time the production using a stop-
watch or other instrument.
2. Repeat for two more trials.
3. Record the longest phonation as MPT.
MPT may vary significantly among speakers with normally functioning vocal folds. Typ-
ical adult males can sustain vowel sounds for 25 to 35 seconds and adult females can sustain 
vowel sounds for 15 to 25 seconds. In general, glottic insufficiency is a concern for speakers 
who are able to sustain vowel sounds for fewer than 10 seconds.
S/Z Ratio
The s/z ratio is another widely used test for measuring respiratory and phonatory efficiency. 
Because /s/ and /z/ are produced the same way, except for voicing, a speaker with normal 
phonatory function will sustain both sounds for approximately the same amount of time. 
Sequence of administration is as follows:
1. Ask the client to take a deep breath and sustain /s/ for as long as possible. Time the 
production using a stopwatch or other instrument. Repeat twice.
2. Ask the client to take a deep breath and sustain /z/ for as long as possible. Time the 
production using a stopwatch or other instrument. Repeat twice.
3. Divide the longest /s/ by the longest /z/.
Interpret findings according to the following guidelines:
 t A 1.0 ratio with normal duration for both phonemes (approximately 10 seconds 
for children and 20 to 25 seconds for adults) indicates normal respiratory and vocal 
function.
 t A ratio above 1.0 with normal duration of /s/ and reduced duration of /z/ indicates 
vocal fold pathology. The higher the ratio is above 1.0, the greater the likelihood that 
a laryngeal pathology exists.
 t A 1.0 ratio with reduced duration for both sounds indicates respiratory inefficiency.

ASSESSMENT HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
Objective analysis of voice and resonance is possible with the use of specialized hardware 
or software. These tools often provide the objective counterpart to perceptual assessment. 
They range from simple apps to sophisticated and comprehensive assessment systems.  
Instruments that assess acoustic properties quantify aspects of voice such as fundamental 
frequency, range, intensity, quality, tremor, jitter, shimmer, maximum phonation time, and 
vocal efficiency. Instruments that analyze aerodynamic properties measure aspects of res-
piration that affect voice and speech production such as phonatory flow rates and volumes, 
subglottic pressure, resistance, vital capacity, s/z ratio, and maximum phonation time. Imag-
ing techniques allow direct viewing of the larynx and vocal folds.
Some of the most commonly used hardware and software tools for assessment of reso-
nance and voice include the following:
 t Aerophone II: an instrument that measures aerodynamic properties of speech includ-
ing sound pressure levels, airflow, and air pressure.
 t Computerized Speech Lab (CSL; KayPENTAX): a complete hardware and software 
system for acoustic analysis of multiple aspects of voice, speech, and fluency.
 t Digital endoscope: a fiberoptic tube fitted with a light and camera that can be  
directed into the oral cavity for visual viewing of the larynx. A stroboscope is a type  
of endoscope that emits a pulsing light, as opposed to constant light, allowing for a 
motionless or slow motion effect when viewing the vocal folds.
 t Electroglottograph: a noninvasive instrument that measures vocal fold contact during 
voice production and aids in assessment of abductory function of the vocal folds.
 t Fundamental Frequency Indicator: a computerized instrument that measures multi-
ple aspects of pitch, including habitual pitch, best pitch, and pitch range.
 t Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP: KayPENTAX): a powerful software 
tool that analyzes multiple aspects of vocal quality and their interactive effects on one 
another.
 t Nasometer (KayPENTAX): an instrument that quantifies nasality by measuring 
acoustic energy in the mouth and nose during speech.
 t Phonatory Function Analyzer: a computerized instrument that measures aerody-
namic and acoustic properties of speech including airflow rate, volume of expired  
air, vocal frequency, and pitch.
 t ‚ÄúPitch Analyzer‚Äù (by Ting Wang): a simple app that identifies pitch frequency, ampli-
tude, and equivalent note name and location on a music staff and keyboard.
 t Pratt (Boersma & Weenink, 2014): a software program that analyzes multiple acous-
tic aspects of speech and voice. It can be downloaded free from the Internet at  
http://www.praat.org.
 t Visi-Pitch (KayPENTAX): a hardware/software system that measures several aspects 
of voice and speech, including fundamental frequency, pitch range and intonation,  
intensity, glottal attack, and stress patterns.
 t ‚ÄúVoice Test‚Äù (by Danube Team): a simple app that provides basic measures of funda-
mental frequency, shimmer, and jitter.

VOICE AND  
RESONANCE
CHAPTER 12 Assessment of Voice and Resonance 
Form 12-5, ‚ÄúAssessment of Voice Worksheet,‚Äù is helpful for recording and summarizing 
findings from a voice assessment.
ASSESSMENT OF RESONANCE
Resonance disorders result from faulty sound vibration in the oral, nasal, and/or pharyngeal 
cavities. They should not be confused with voice disorders, which result from faulty laryngeal 
function, although both influence perceptions of a speaker‚Äôs voice. Normal resonance occurs 
when air for speech is directed through the oral cavity, by closure of the velopharyngeal port, 
during production of all vowels and oral consonants, and directed through the nasal cavity 
during production of nasal consonants, specifically /m/, /n/, and /N/.
The most common disorders of resonance are:
 t Disorders due to incomplete closure of the velopharyngeal port:
 - Hypernasality: occurs when there is too much sound vibration in the nasal cavity 
during vowels and voiced oral consonants.
 - Nasal emissions: occurs when air escapes through the nose during speech.
 - Phoneme-specific velopharyngeal dysfunction: occurs when there is audible nasal emis-
sion on only certain sounds (usually /s/ and /z/). It results from velopharyngeal mis-
learning, not dysfunction, and is not a structural issue.
 t Disorders due to an obstruction:
 - Hyponasality: occurs when there is too little sound vibration in the nasal cavity 
during nasal consonants. Phoneme /m/ sounds like /b/, /n/ sounds like /d/, and /N/ 
sounds like /g/.
 - Cul-de-sac resonance: occurs when airflow in the oral cavity is obstructed, often by 
enlarged tonsils, resulting in a muffled voice quality.
A quick assessment of resonance can be accomplished by making a nasal listening tube 
from a bendy straw or piece of tubing. The clinician places one end of the tube in his or her 
ear and the other end at the client‚Äôs nostril. The client is then asked to speak conversationally 
or perform a targeted speech task. Assess findings according to the following guidelines:
 t If the clinician hears sound through the tube during production of vowels or plosives, 
hypernasality is indicated.
 t If minimal or no sound is heard through the tube during production of nasal sounds, 
hyponasality or cul-de-sac resonance is indicated.
This assessment technique allows the clinician to test each naris separately to obtain 
more discriminative information.
To assess velopharyngeal function specifically, gently pinch the client‚Äôs nose closed and ask 
him or her to repeat some of the nonnasal sentences containing pressure consonants presented in 
Table 12-4. The pressure consonants require a great amount of intraoral air pressure to produce. 
Hypernasality is identified if excessive nasal pressure is felt or if nasopharyngeal snorting occurs.
Assimilation nasality occurs when nonnasal sounds that precede or follow nasal consonants 
are also nasalized. To evaluate, instruct the client to repeat the following words and phrases with 
nasal sounds. Listen carefully for the presence of assimilation nasality. Pay particular attention to 
the client‚Äôs speech rate in relation to the severity of the assimilation nasality. Is the assimilation 
nasality more noticeable at a faster speech rate? Is it eliminated at a slower speech rate?

Compensatory articulatory productions, usually pharyngeal or glottal sounds, may occur if 
there is velopharyngeal dysfunction. These productions may linger even after the structural 
defect has been repaired, requiring articulation treatment. Some of the more common com-
pensatory patterns are noted in the following list. Phonetic symbols used during transcrip-
tion are provided in parentheses.
 t Glottal stops (///): The vocal folds are used in an effort to produce plosive consonants. 
This strategy is frequently detected in cleft palate speech.
 t Pharyngeal stops (/ /, unvoiced; / / voiced): Produced by lingual contact with the  
posterior pharyngeal wall.
 t Mid-dorsum palatal stops (/ /, unvoiced; / / voiced): The mid-dorsum of the tongue 
makes contact with the mid-palate.
 t Pharyngeal fricatives (/¬ø/, unvoiced; /?/ voiced): Produced by narrowing the pharyn-
geal airway through linguapharyngeal constriction. These are attempted substitutes 
for sibilant fricatives.
 t Velar fricatives (/X/, unvoiced; /V/ voiced): Fricatives are produced in the approximate 
place where /k/ and /g/ are normally produced.
 t Nasal fricatives (/ /, / /, / /): Excessive nasal emission is used as a substitute for con-
sonants. These are also referred to as ‚Äúnasal snorts,‚Äù ‚Äúnasal rustles,‚Äù or ‚Äúnasal friction.‚Äù
 t Posterior nasal fricatives (/ ©/): Produced when the velum or uvula approximates the 
posterior pharyngeal wall of the nasopharynx. The back of the tongue may elevate in 
an attempt to assist in velopharyngeal closure.
 t Nasal grimaces: A narrowing of the nostrils produced in an attempt to control nasal 
emission and inefficient use of the air source.
To assess hyponasality, instruct the client to repeat the sentences containing nasal sounds 
listed previously. Listen carefully for appropriateness of resonance. Then have him or her 
repeat the sentences while you gently pinch the client‚Äôs nose closed. If unoccluded and  
occluded productions sound the same, hyponasality is present.
The procedures described in this section for assessing velopharyngeal dysfunction may 
not be adequate for identifying mild or borderline instances. Instruments and/or software 
programs that measure aerodynamic factors or allow direct viewing of the velopharyn-
geal mechanism may be required, such as a nasometer, the MDVP (described earlier), or a 
nasopharyngoscope. These tools require prior training and expertise before using.
Clients diagnosed with hypernasality or generalized nasal emission should be referred to 
a craniofacial medical doctor for further assessment. These are structural defects requiring 
surgical management. Hyponasality or cul-de-sac resonance typically results from obstruc-
tion in the vocal tract, and should be assessed by a laryngologist. Speech intervention is 
appropriate when a client demonstrates phoneme-specific nasality, nasal emission due to 
faulty articulation, or a compensatory articulation disorder that persists following surgical 
management of velopharyngeal dysfunction.

Assessment of Alaryngeal Clients
Laryngectomy is the surgical removal of all or part of the larynx. Most commonly, laryngec-
tomy is performed to remove cancerous tumors, or, in the case of traumatic injury, to remove a 
larynx that is severely damaged and not repairable. Obvious and immediate changes occur to 
the physiology of the speech mechanism as a result of a laryngectomy. Figure 12-4 shows the 
anatomical changes. The major respiratory and vocal changes are summarized in Table 12-5.

VOICE AND  
RESONANCE
CHAPTER 12 Assessment of Voice and Resonance 
Because the vocal mechanism is completely or partially gone, oral communication is 
profoundly impaired. A primary responsibility of the speech-language pathologist is to help 
the client establish an adequate postoperative means of communication as soon as possible. 
Assessment involves preoperative and postoperative consultations. Prior to the preoperative 
visit, consult the client‚Äôs physician and review all relevant medical records to learn as much 
information as possible about the surgery. Form 12-6, ‚ÄúAlaryngeal Assessment,‚Äù may be used 
to collect this information.
The preoperative consultation with the client provides an opportunity to describe the  
effects of surgery on communication and discuss post-surgery communication options. 
Other objectives are given in the following list. During this initial visit, be sensitive to just 
how much information the client is prepared to receive. Some of the information may need 
to be repeated or deferred until the postoperative consultation.
 t Determine what the client already knows.
 t Be positive about post-surgery outcomes.
 t Instruct the client to be patient with him- or herself as a new mode of communica-
tion is learned.
 t Correct misunderstandings, reinforce correct information, and provide new 
information.
 t Provide information about support groups.
 t Encourage family involvement.
 t If the client is amenable, have a rehabilitated alaryngeal speaker visit the client  
and family.

The patient could inhale air into the lungs  
 through the nose or the mouth or both. 
The patient can take air into the lungs only  
 through the stoma in the neck. 
The patient could exhale air from the lungs  
 through the nose or the mouth or both. 
The patient can exhale lung air only through  
 the stoma in the neck. 
The air inhaled through the nose was  
  warmed, moistened, and filtered en route  
to the lungs. 
The air taken into the stoma passes rapidly into  
  the lungs without the benefit of passing 
through upper respiratory tract passages. 
The respiratory tract was continuous from the  
  lungs through the bronchi, trachea, and 
larynx to the pharynx, mouth, and nose. 
The tracheal stump is sutured to, and terminates  
  at, the stoma. No communication exists 
between the mouth, nose, pharynx and the 
trachea, bronchi, and lungs. 
Pulmonary air is exhaled directly through the  
 stoma.

 t Discuss communication options.
 t Provide printed information about laryngectomy, postoperative care, and alaryngeal 
communication options.
 t Informally assess cognition and speech and language skills.
 t Informally observe or assess writing skills.
The postoperative visit provides opportunity to review information provided preop-
eratively and focuses on more detailed discussion and demonstration of alaryngeal com-
munication options. Encourage the client to try a variety of options that are suitable 
considering his or her needs and situation. The selection of one option does not preclude 
the use of another.
Alaryngeal Communication Options
There are three primary alaryngeal communication options:
 t An artificial larynx is an electronic or mechanical instrument that provides a sound 
source as speech is shaped by the articulators. Some devices are held against the neck, 
whereas others have a tube that is placed in the oral cavity. In many cases, an artificial 
larynx is a first means of alaryngeal communication following surgery.
 t Esophageal speech relies on a client‚Äôs remaining anatomical structures to produce an 
internal source of sound. The speaker takes air in through the mouth, traps it in the 
throat, and then releases it back through the mouth, articulating normally. Esopha-
geal speech is difficult to master.
 t A tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) is a surgical procedure whereby a surgeon makes 
a small hole in the common wall shared by the trachea and esophagus and fits it with 
a one-way shunt valve. The speaker inhales air into the lungs through the stoma, 
and then covers the stoma to direct the air through the valve and into the esophagus, 
which vibrates and creates a sound source for speech. This is one of the more com-
mon alaryngeal communication options.
All three alaryngeal communication options have advantages and disadvantages. These 
are summarized in Table 12-6.
In some cases, one option is used initially and another is used later. For example, an arti-
ficial larynx is often selected as an immediate form of communication while a client awaits 
healing of the region for later use of TEP.
ASSESSMENT OF CLIENTS WITH CLEFT LIP AND/OR PALATE
Orofacial clefts are malformations that occur early in the gestational period when the tissues 
in the mouth or lip area, or both, do not fuse together properly. Clefts vary in size, extent, 
and severity, and therefore have varying impact on normal speech development. Figure 12-5 
shows normal structures, unilateral and bilateral cleft lip, cleft palate, and unilateral and bi-
lateral cleft lip and palate.
Surgical closure of a cleft before single-word development begins (at approximately 
age¬†1) often precludes the development of cleft-related speech problems. This is not al-
ways the case, however. A primary characteristic of cleft palate speech is faulty resonance.

TABLE 12-6 
 Advantages and Disadvantages of the Three Primary 
Alaryngeal Communication Options
ARTIFICIAL LARYNX
Advantages:
Easy to use
Speech is generally intelligible
Suitable for use immediately after surgery in most cases
Can be an interim source of communication
Disadvantages: 
Mechanical, ‚Äúrobot-like‚Äù vocal quality
Draws attention to the speaker 
Requires good articulation skills
Requires the use of one hand
ESOPHAGEAL SPEECH
Advantages: 
Does not require reliance upon a mechanical device
Both hands are free while speaking
Vocal productions are the client‚Äôs ‚Äúown voice‚Äù
More natural sounding than electromechanical devices
Disadvantages: 
 
Difficult to learn (approximately one-third of laryngectomees are unable  
to learn esophageal speech)
Client may need to learn to habitually speak in shorter phrases
Vocal intensity is sometimes insufficient
Client may have a hoarse voice quality
Potential articulatory errors, excessive stoma noise, ‚Äúklunking,‚Äù and facial 
grimacing need to be overcome during the learning process
TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL SPEECH
Advantages: 
Most natural voice quality of all alaryngeal communication options
Greater pitch and intensity range than esophageal speech
Easier and faster to learn than esophageal speech
Clients can effectively produce sentences of normal length
Disadvantages: 
Requires additional surgery
Maintenance of the prosthesis is required
Manual occlusion of the stoma is required if a tracheostoma valve is not used
Some risk of aspiration of the prosthesis
Children with clefts are also at increased risk for voice and articulation disorders due to their 
efforts to compensate for structural abnormalities. Many of the worksheets and guidelines 
provided in this chapter for assessment of voice and resonance are appropriate for assessing 
clients with clefts. Additionally, worksheets and guidelines in other chapters are also useful 
for basic assessment protocols.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
Language disorders are not necessarily associated with clefts, as many children in this 
population develop language normally. However, children with clefts often have language 
disorders due to cleft-related hearing loss, negative social and emotional factors, or cognitive 
delay, especially if the cleft coexists with other conditions.
An orofacial examination is an important component of a complete evaluation of a client 
with a cleft. In addition to the traditional elements of an orofacial examination, these factors 
should be considered when assessing a client with a cleft lip and/or palate:
 t Type of cleft
 t Stage and adequacy of repair
 t Presence of other facial abnormalities such as fistulas or labial pits
 t Presence of a submucosal cleft. This is often indicated by a bifid uvula, reduced or 
asymmetrical palatal movement, translucency or thinning of musculature at the velum 
midline, or a palpable notch on the posterior edge of the hard palate.
 t Perceived length of the velum
 t Perceived depth of the nasopharynx
 t Shape of the alveolar ridge (e.g., notched, cleft, wide, collapsed)

CHAPTER 12 Assessment of Voice and Resonance 
Articulation considerations specific to clients with clefts include:
 t Possible hypernasality during production of pressure consonants
 t Increased hypernasality during vowel production
 t Possible nasal emission, especially during production of sibilants /s/ and /z/
 t Possible presence of less common phonological processes
 t Worsened nasality during connected speech, as opposed to individual word productions
Form 12-7, ‚ÄúChecklist for the Assessment of Clients with Clefts,‚Äù is provided to help 
summarize information gathered during the speech-language evaluation. Other assessment 
instruments that are helpful for evaluating clients with clefts include:
 t Great Ormand Street Speech Assessment: A Screening Assessment of Cleft Palate Speech 
(Sell, Harding, & Grunwell, 1994)
 t Several assessment protocols in Communicative Disorders Related to Cleft Lip and  
Palate (5th ed.) (Bzoch, 2004)
Feeding concerns may be a primary focus of care for infants with clefts. More informa-
tion about pediatric feeding and swallowing is presented in Chapter 15.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
The evaluation of voice and resonance is multifaceted. Respiratory, vibratory, and resonatory 
systems all influence perceptions of voice. A thorough case history, physical examination, 
perceptual evaluation, and instrumental analysis are all important aspects of a complete as-
sessment. The speech-language pathologist typically works with a team of professionals to 
provide appropriate services to clients. Alaryngeal clients and clients with cleft lip and/or 
palate often present with voice and/or resonance disorders.

his chapter focuses on the assessment of neurocognitive speech and language disorders that 
have a major impact on communication‚Äîspecifically, aphasia, right hemisphere syndrome, 
traumatic brain injury, and dementia. These conditions are most commonly associated with 
adults, although they can affect any age group. The qualifying marker for classification as a 
neurocognitive disorder is a decline, either suddenly or over time, in cognitive function.

ASSESSMENT OF APHASIA
Aphasia is defined as a loss of language function due to an injury to the brain in an area asso-
ciated with the comprehension and production of language. Aphasia is most often caused by 
a stroke or cerebral vascular accident (CVA). Other etiologies include accident, tumor, infec-
tion, toxicity, and metabolic and nutritional disorders that affect brain function. Aphasia can 
have multiple ramifications. Every client will be different depending on a variety of factors, 
including the site of the injury, the severity of the injury, and the uniqueness of the individ-
ual. The fact that clients may vary so dramatically from one another makes it challenging to 
clearly define aphasia in terms of a set of behaviors and deficits.
Experts have different opinions about how aphasia ought to be classified or indeed 
whether classifications should exist at all. These differences of opinion are due to the fact 
that the brain functions to integrate all aspects of language, and an injury to a particular site 
typically affects all language modalities to one degree or another. Therefore, clear-cut symp-
toms following a brain injury simply do not exist. On the other hand, classification systems 
do help us clarify broad categories of language deficiencies based on the site of the injury 
even though there is a degree of variation from one client to another.
Table 13-1 summarizes several types of aphasia according to one of the most commonly 
used classification systems. The aphasia types are differentiated according to fluent and non-
fluent characteristics. Keep in mind when using this type of classification system that apha-
sia is not always so easily simplified. In practice, a clinician will typically not find ‚Äútextbook

cases‚Äù of the different types of aphasia. In reality, aphasia is manifest differently in every 
client, and the lines separating one type from another are not clearly defined.
Although there is variation from one aphasic client to the next, there are certain behav-
iors and deficits of communication that are characteristic of aphasia. These include:
 t Impaired auditory comprehension
 t Impaired verbal expression
 t Presence of paraphasias
 t Perseveration
 t Agrammatism, or grammatical errors
 t Nonfluent speech or nonmeaningful fluent speech
 t Impaired prosodic features of speech
 t Difficulty repeating words, phrases, and sentences
 t Problems with naming and word finding (anomia)
 t Impaired reading ability (alexia or dyslexia)
 t Impaired writing ability (agraphia or dysgraphia; possibly confounded by loss of use 
of the dominant right hand due to hemiparesis)
 t In bilingual clients, unequal impairment between the two languages
 t Pragmatic deficits
 t Difficulty using or understanding gestures
When completing an evaluation of aphasia, identify strengths and deficiencies within all 
these areas in order to make the most complete and realistic diagnosis and treatment plan for

the client. Several formal tests are available for the assessment of aphasia. Some of the most 
commonly used published tests include:
 t Aphasia Diagnostic Profiles (ADP) (Helm-Estabrooks, 1992)
 t Boston Assessment of Severe Aphasia (BASA) (Helm-Estabrooks, Ramsberger,  
Morgan, & Nicholas, 1989)
 t Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE-3) (Goodglass, Kaplan, & Barresi, 
2000)
 t Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) (Swiburn, Porter, & Howard, 2004)
 t Examining for Aphasia: Assessment of Aphasia and Related Impairments (EFA-4)  
(La Pointe & Eisenson, 2008)
 t Quick Assessment for Aphasia (Tanner & Culbertson, 1999)
 t Reading Comprehension Battery for Aphasia (RCBA-2) (La Pointe & Horner, 1998)
 t Western Aphasia Battery Revised (WAB-R) (Kertesz, 2006)
Tasks for identifying skills and deficits of aphasic clients are found in Form 13-1  
‚ÄúEvaluation of Aphasia.‚Äù These evaluation procedures are based on principles and tasks 
common to many examinations of aphasia. The materials in Form 13-1 allow the clinician to 
assess a variety of receptive and expressive skills by using simple tasks that vary in difficulty. 
In the ‚ÄúComments‚Äù sections, make specific notes about the client‚Äôs behaviors, such as delayed 
responses (include length of time), self-corrections, numbers and types of cues provided by 
the therapist, perseverations, visual neglect, response accuracy (e.g., incorrect response but 
correct response class), and so forth. Gain as much relevant information as possible for a 
complete assessment.
Although failure to respond correctly to some items may be the result of aphasia, incor-
rect responses may also be the result of other disorders (e.g., language deficiencies secondary 
to severe hearing impairment, visual impairment, mental impairment, poor academic skills, 
schizophrenia). Know the client‚Äôs medical history! Aphasia results from a neurological in-
sult. The symptoms have a sudden onset (at the time of neurological insult), not a gradual 
onset as in the case of other disorders that have similar symptoms. To accurately assess 
aphasia, obtain as much information as possible about the nature of the disorder, including 
events surrounding its onset, communicative abilities prior to its onset, and results of any 
related neurological assessments (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computerized 
tomographic [CT] scan).
The test items are not score-based or criterion-based. Rather, the tasks are designed 
to identify strengths and weaknesses. When administering the items, include tasks from 
each section. Administer entire sections or sample from within each section. The tasks are 
arranged in an easy to difficult sequence; sample some of the more difficult tasks before  
assuming a client does or does not have a deficit in that given area.
ASSESSMENT OF RIGHT HEMISPHERE SYNDROME
Traditionally, the left hemisphere of the brain is known as the hemisphere of language 
function. However, both cerebral hemispheres perform specific tasks that complement and 
are integrated with tasks that are specific to the opposite hemisphere. Simply stated, both

hemispheres are vitally important for normal and functional communication. The left hemi-
sphere is primarily responsible for basic language functions, such as phonology, syntax, and 
simple-level semantics. The right hemisphere is primarily responsible for complex linguistic 
processing and the nonverbal, emotional aspects of communication.
Injury to the right hemisphere of the brain results in a unique set of deficits that can 
significantly affect a person‚Äôs ability to communicate and function appropriately in his or her 
environment. As with other neurologically based disorders, outcomes from right hemisphere 
damage can vary significantly from one client to another. However, there are specific im-
pairments that are characteristic of right hemisphere damage. These are summarized from 
Brookshire (2003) and Tompkins (1995) and fall into four categories:
Perceptual and Attentional Deficits
 t Neglect of the left visual field
 t Difficulty with facial recognition (prosopagnosia)
 t Difficulty with constructional tasks
 t Impulsivity, distractibility, and poor attention to tasks
 t Excessive attention to irrelevant information
 t Denial of deficits (anosognosia)
Affective Deficits
 t Difficulty expressing emotions
 t Difficulty recognizing emotions of others
 t Depression
 t Apparent lack of motivation
Communicative Deficits
 t Difficulty with word retrieval
 t Impaired auditory comprehension
 t Reading and writing deficits
 t Impaired prosodic features of speech
 t Difficulty with pragmatics
 t Dysarthria
Cognitive Deficits
 t Disorientation
 t Impaired attention
 t Difficulty with memory
 t Poor integration of information
 t Difficulty with logic, reasoning, planning, and problem solving
 t Impaired comprehension of inferred meanings
 t Difficulty understanding humor

Many of the characteristics of right hemisphere syndrome are similar to those of aphasia, 
resulting from left hemisphere damage. To assist in the differential diagnosis of these two 
disorders, see Table 13-2.
The ‚ÄúCognitive‚ÄìLinguistic Evaluation,‚Äù Form 13-2, is an informal assessment designed 
to identify specific problem areas that may be present in a client with a right cerebral hemi-
sphere injury. There are also a variety of other assessment materials included in this book 
that may be helpful. These include:
 t ‚ÄúEvaluation of Aphasia,‚Äù Form 13-1. Selected subsections may be used to assess 
memory, logic, reasoning, problem solving, auditory processing, thought organization, 
reading, and writing.
 t ‚ÄúAssessment of Pragmatic Skills,‚Äù Form 7-8. This worksheet may be useful for assess-
ing a variety of pragmatic responses.
 t ‚ÄúAssessment of Clients with Traumatic Brain Injury,‚Äù Form 13-3. Selected questions 
in this behavioral profile may be helpful for gathering specific information from 
 family members or other caregivers.

ASSESSMENT OF CLIENTS WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the result of an acute assault on the brain. There are two 
subcategories of TBIs: penetrating injuries and closed-head injuries. Penetrating injuries 
occur when an object, such as a bullet or a knife, penetrates the skull and rips through the 
soft brain tissue, damaging nerve fibers and nerve cells. The neurological damage is focal 
(localized) and the resulting behaviors vary, depending on the severity and location of the 
injury. Closed-head injuries are incurred from the collision of the head with an object or 
surface that does not penetrate the skull. Even though the skull remains intact, the brain can 
be severely damaged. The damage is diffuse (nonlocalized), and the resulting behaviors vary 
depending on the severity and location(s) of the injury.
Considering the varying nature of a TBI, one can understand why there is no such thing 
as a typical brain injury. Also, a brain injury can occur at any age. These factors pose a unique 
challenge to the clinician attempting to assess the communicative skills of a client who has 
suffered a head injury. A uniform set of symptoms characteristic of all TBIs does not exist. 
However, some commonly seen consequences of brain injury include:
 t Inconsistency
 t Attention deficits
 t Impaired memory
 t Impaired language
 t Disorientation to time and place
 t Poor organization
 t Impaired reasoning
 t Reduced ability to write or draw
 t Anomia

 t Restlessness
 t Irritability
 t Distractibility
 t High frustration and anxiety
 t Aggressive behavior
 t Inconsistent responses
 t Disorders of smell and taste
 t Poor judgment
 t Poor control of emotions
 t Denial of disability
 t Poor self-care
These behaviors vary depending upon the type of injury, the severity, the cerebral systems 
involved, the presence of additional neuromedical variables (e.g., extended coma, cerebral 
hemorrhage), the client‚Äôs age, and the pre-trauma status.
A person who has suffered a TBI normally experiences a period of unconsciousness at the 
time of injury. It may last for only a few seconds, or for many days or months. The Glasgow 
Coma Scale (GCS) is a frequently used scoring system for assessing levels of conciousness 
following TBI. It is based on objective measures of eye opening (E), verbal response (V), and 
motor response (M). The score is expressed as individual categories and as a summation of 
the three categories (e.g., E3 ! V3 ! M4 " GCS10). Total scores range from 3 (comatose) 
to 15 (grossly neurologically intact). The GCS and interpretive information is presented in 
Table 13-3.
Another frequently used rating system is The Rancho Levels of Cognitive Functioning. 
It is helpful for identifying cognitive status in clients with recent-onset, severe head injuries. 
There are eight levels, each identified with a Roman numeral. The Rancho Levels of Cogni-
tive Functioning with specific cognitive characteristics are presented in Table 13-4.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
The assessment of clients with TBI will vary depending upon many factors, including 
the client‚Äôs age, severity of the injury, and current level of consciousness. Before meeting  
with the client, obtain a thorough case history. Research the type and severity of the head 
injury, the date of onset, and the cerebral areas affected. Obtain evaluation dates and results 
from other assessments (e.g., CT scans, MRIs). Review GCS ratings and Rancho Levels, 
noting changes across time. It is important to continually review the client‚Äôs medical chart 
during the assessment process and treatment because of the significant changes that often 
occur following a brain injury.
The direct assessment will typically include the following considerations:
 t Visuospatial, visuomotor, and visuoconstructional abilities
 t General motor functioning
 t General emotional functioning
 t Chewing and swallowing abilities
 t Pragmatic behaviors
 t Speech
 t Expressive and receptive language abilities
 t Cognitive and intellectual abilities, including memory, processing, reasoning judg-
ment, and problem-solving
 t Execution of activities of daily living
Several formal speech and language assessment instruments that are appropriate for  
assessing the communicative effects of TBI include:
 t Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (3rd ed.) (Goodglass, Kaplan, & Barresi, 2000)
 t Brief Test of Head Injury (Helm-Estabrooks & Hotz, 1991)
 t The Cognitive Assessment of Minnesota (Rustad et al., 1993)

 t Ross Information Processing Assessment (2nd ed.) (RIPA-2) (Ross-Swain, 1996)
 t Ross Information Processing Assessment‚ÄîPrimary (RIPA-P) (Ross-Swain, 1999)
 t Scales of Cognitive Ability for Traumatic Brain Injury (Adamovich & Henderson, 1992)
 t Western Aphasia Battery‚ÄîRevised (WAB-R) (Kertesz, 2006)
Form 13-3, ‚ÄúAssessment of Clients with Traumatic Brain Injury,‚Äù is a worksheet for 
informally evaluating clients with a TBI. Ask a family member, nurse, or other caregiver to 
serve as the informant. Ideally, the form is to be completed over an extended period of time 
(1 to 2 days) by someone who spends a significant amount of time with the client. Some less 
impaired clients may be able to answer the questions themselves.
Other resources included in this manual may also be helpful for assessing clients with 
TBI. For example:
 t Form 13-2, ‚ÄúCognitive‚ÄìLinguistic Evaluation,‚Äù is appropriate for assessing memory, 
orientation, auditory processing and comprehension, problem solving, reasoning, 
thought organization, visual processing, and graphic expression.

ASSESSMENT OF CLIENTS WITH DEMENTIA  
(MAJOR NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER)
Major neurocognitive disorder, more commonly known as dementia, is characterized by 
progressive deterioration of memory, orientation, intellectual ability, and behavioral appro-
priateness. It generally progresses from a very mild to a very severe cognitive impairment 
over the course of months or even years. This section on the assessment of dementia focuses 
on irreversible dementias, but there are forms of dementia that are reversible. For example, 
certain medications can cause symptoms of dementia. Depression can manifest in dementia-
like behaviors. Also, certain medical conditions such as tumors or infections may result in 
dementia. These reversible forms of dementia are generally treated by other health care pro-
fessionals, yet it is still important for the speech-language pathologist to be knowledgeable 
about nonreversible dementias and conditions related to reversible dementia.
The most common form of progressive, irreversible dementia is Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. 
Other dementias include multi-infarct dementia (MID), Pick‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease 
(PD), Huntington‚Äôs disease (HD), Wilson‚Äôs disease, supranuclear palsy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease, and Korsakoff ‚Äôs syndrome. Most dementias follow a general pattern of progression. 
We have divided this pattern into three stages, although there may be variability from one 
client to another and from one dementia type to another. The following stages are primarily 
related to dementia of the Alzheimer‚Äôs type; however, several other forms of dementia have 
similar patterns of progression.
Stage 1: Early Dementia
 t Slow, insidious onset
 t Some memory loss
 t Word-finding problems
 t Poor attention span
 t Disorientation
 t Reasoning and judgment problems
 t Difficulty with abstract concepts
 t Empty speech at times
 t Intact automatic speech

 t Intact articulation and phonological skills
 t Intact syntactic skills
 t Mechanics of writing and reading intact, although meaning may be obscured
 t Possible anxiety, depression, agitation, and apathy
 t Attitude of indifference toward deficits
Stage 2: Intermediate Dementia
 t Increasing memory loss (The client may forget the names of loved ones, although 
usually remembers his or her own name.)
 t Increasing word-finding deficits
 t Decreasing orientation
 t Empty speech
 t Poor topic maintenance
 t Intact automatic speech
 t Intact articulation and phonological skills
 t Intact syntactic skills
 t Mechanics of writing and reading still intact, although meaning is more obscured
 t Wandering
 t Unable to take care of own needs
 t Inability to perform complex tasks
 t Perseveratory behaviors such as chewing or lip smacking
 t Withdrawal from challenging situations
 t Personality and emotional changes such as delusional behaviors, obsessive behaviors, 
anxiety, agitation, and previously nonexistent violent behaviors
Stage 3: Advanced Dementia
 t Severely impaired memory
 t Profound intellectual deterioration
 t Severely impaired verbal abilities, speech is meaningless or absent.
 t Unable to participate in social interaction
 t Physical debilitation
 t Aimless wandering
 t Restlessness and agitation
 t Possible violent outbursts
 t The client requires assistance for all activities of daily living.
During the speech-language evaluation, the case history questions are especially  
important for determining the etiology and prognosis of a client‚Äôs dementia. As many of the  
client‚Äôs primary caregivers and family members as possible need to be consulted to offer

details related to the onset and progression of the client‚Äôs condition. In addition to tradi-
tional case history questions, the clinician may also want to ask:
 t What behaviors were first noticed and when?
 t How have the behaviors changed over time?
 t Was the onset sudden or gradual?
 t What other events were occurring in the client‚Äôs life at the time of onset?
 t What is the client‚Äôs psychiatric history?
 t What problems is the client having taking care of his or her daily needs?
 t How has the client attempted to compensate for his or her deficits?
 t How do you and others currently communicate with the client?
One frequently used dementia assessment tool is the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975/2001). It is often used as an initial test for 
a possible diagnosis of dementia. The examination is quick to administer, only taking about 
10 minutes, and the outcome can provide direction for further assessment. The examination 
measures memory, orientation, and cognitive abilities. Other commercially available assess-
ment tools include:
 t Alzheimer‚Äôs Quick Test (AQT) Assessment of Temporal-Parietal Function (Wiig, Nielsen, 
Minthon, & Warkentin, 2002)
 t Cognitive-Linguistic Quick Test (Helm-Estabrooks, 2001)
Each can be used as a screening tool for identification of neurologic dysfunction.
If the outcome of a dementia screening test indicates a need for further evaluation, there 
are several commercially available assessment tools for dementia. Take care to select testing 
materials that are appropriate for the client‚Äôs level of cognition and awareness because as-
sessment tools vary widely in their focus, length, and application. Some evaluative tools to 
consider include:
 t Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD) (Bayles &  
Tomoeda, 1993)
 t Communication Activities of Daily Living (CADL-2) (Holland, Fratalli, &  
Fromm, 1999)
 t Dementia Rating Scale (DRS-2) (Mattis, Jurica, & Leitten, 2001)
 t Functional Linguistic Communication Inventory (Bayles & Tomoeda, 1995)
 t Ross Information Processing Assessment‚ÄîGeriatric (RIPA-G) (Ross-Swain &  
Fogle, 1996)
 t Severe Impairment Battery (Saxton, McGonigle, Swihart, & Boller, 1993). This test is 
appropriate for a client who scores less than eight on the MMSE.
There are also assessment materials in this book that can be adapted for evaluating a 
client with a dementia disorder. For example, subsections of the ‚ÄúCognitive‚ÄìLinguistic  
Evaluation‚Äù (Form 13-2) are appropriate for assessing orientation, memory, auditory pro-
cessing and comprehension, thought organization, and pragmatics. The ‚ÄúEvaluation of 
Aphasia,‚Äù Form 13-1, is useful for assessing memory, semantic concepts, and language

skills. The ‚ÄúAssessment of Pragmatic Skills,‚Äù Form 7-8, can be adapted for the assessment 
of a variety of pragmatic skills. The ‚ÄúReading Passages‚Äù (Chapter 5) can be adapted for 
the assessment of reading comprehension and memory of written material. The ‚ÄúPictures‚Äù 
(Chapter 5) can be used to evaluate thought organization, confrontational naming, and 
language skills. Finally, the ‚ÄúNarratives‚Äù (Chapter 5) can be used to assess auditory com-
prehension and memory.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
The basic principles and methods for the assessment of four neurologically based disorders 
have been addressed in the preceding sections. Each disorder presents a different pattern of 
symptoms and communicative behaviors. Even though each neurologically based disorder is 
a distinct clinical entity, many clients are affected by several disorders simultaneously. This 
requires the clinician to carefully evaluate a variety of communicative skills and abilities. The 
clinician must determine a hierarchy of clinical importance for each disorder diagnosed. It 
is important to view the ‚Äúwhole picture‚Äù and prioritize immediate and less-immediate needs 
for making appropriate diagnostic and treatment decisions.

DIFFERENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS 
OF DYSARTHRIA AND APRAXIA
Dysarthria and apraxia are both motor speech disorders that affect verbal expression. These 
disorders are sometimes confused with each other, especially by beginning clinicians. How-
ever, their symptoms are actually quite different. It is important to understand the differ-
ences between the two disorders to make an appropriate diagnosis. The general differences 
between dysarthria and apraxia are outlined in Table 14-2.
TABLE 14-2 
Differential Characteristics of Dysarthria and Apraxia
DYSARTHRIA
APRAXIA
All processes of speech are affected  
  (including respiration, phonation, 
resonance, articulation, and prosody).
The speech process for articulation is primarily  
 affected. Prosody may also be abnormal.
There is a change in muscle tone  
  secondary to neurologic involvement 
that results in difficulty with voluntary 
and involuntary motor tasks (such as 
swallowing, chewing, and licking).
There is a change in motor programming for speech  
  secondary to neurologic involvement, but muscle 
tone is not affected. Involuntary motor tasks 
typically are not affected.
Speech errors result from a disruption  
  in muscular control of the central and 
peripheral nervous systems.
Speech errors result from a disruption of the message  
  from the motor cortex to the oral musculature.
Errors of speech are consistent and  
  predictable. There are no islands of 
clear speech.
Errors of speech are inconsistent and unpredictable.  
  Islands of clear, well-articulated speech exist.
Articulatory errors are primarily distortions  
 and omissions.
Articulatory errors are primarily substitutions, repetitions,  
  additions, transpositions, prolongations, omissions, 
and distortions (which are least common). Most 
errors are close approximations of the targeted 
phoneme. Errors are often perseveratory or 
anticipatory.
Consonant productions are consistently  
 imprecise; vowels may be neutralized.
Consonants are more difficult than vowels; blends  
  are more difficult than singletons; initial consonants 
are more difficult than final consonants; fricatives 
and affricates are the most difficult consonants. 
Errors increase as the complexity of the motor 
pattern increases.

MOTOR SPEECH 
DISORDERS
CHAPTER 14 Assessment of Motor Speech Disorders
ASSESSMENT OF DYSARTHRIA
Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that results from muscular impairment. Muscular 
weakness, slowness, or incoordination can affect all the basic processes of speech‚Äîrespiration,  
phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody. Articulation errors are the most common 
feature of dysarthria, followed by impairments of voice, resonance, and fluency. Dysarthria 
is sometimes confused with apraxia of speech, also a motor speech disorder associated with 
expressive speech impairment, but the two disorders are quite different. A primary differ-
entiating characteristic is that dysarthria is associated with muscular impairment; apraxia of 
speech is not.
There are six types of dysarthria, each characterized by a different etiology and differ-
ent speech behaviors. During a diagnostic evaluation, it is easy to confuse the dysarthrias, 
because many of their characteristics overlap and more than one type may be present.  
Drs. Arnold Aronson and Frederick Darley of the Mayo Clinic pioneered research into the 
differential characteristics of the dysarthrias. Their work has led to a standard classification 
system for identifying the different dysarthrias in clinical practice. A summary of their work 
and a listing of potential etiologies for each dysarthria are presented in Table 14-3.
To complete an assessment of dysarthria, complete an orofacial examination and obtain a 
good speech sample at structured levels (according to syllabic length) and in continuous speech. 
These samples will be the basis for identifying the primary speech characteristics the client ex-
hibits. Suggestions for obtaining a speech sample are found in other sections of this book. The 
‚ÄúReading Passages‚Äù and ‚ÄúSyllable-by-Syllable Stimulus Phrases‚Äù in Chapter 5 may be helpful for 
obtaining a sample. Three frequently used tests for evaluating dysarthric speech are:
 t Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (Yorkston, Beukelman, & Traynor, 
1984)
 t Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (2nd. ed.) (EDA-2) (Enderby & Palmer, 2008)
 t Quick Assessment for Dysarthria (Tanner & Culbertson, 1999)
Form 14-1, ‚ÄúIdentifying Dysarthria,‚Äù is another useful tool for analyzing a client‚Äôs speech 
and identifying the type of dysarthria present.
DYSARTHRIA
APRAXIA
The speech rate may be slow and  
  labored; strain, tension, and poor 
breath support may be apparent.
A prosodic disorder may occur as a result of  
  compensatory behaviors (stopping, restarting, 
and difficulty initiating phonation and correct 
articulatory postures).
Speech intelligibility is often reduced as  
  the speaking rate increases.
Speech intelligibility sometimes increases as the  
 speaking rate increases.
Increases in word/phrase complexity  
  result in poorer articulatory 
performance.
Increases in word/phrase complexity result in poorer  
 articulatory performance.

MOTOR SPEECH 
DISORDERS
CHAPTER 14 Assessment of Motor Speech Disorders
ASSESSMENT OF APRAXIA
Apraxia is a motor disorder resulting from neurological damage. It is characterized  
by an inability to execute volitional (purposeful) movements despite having normal mus-
cle tone and coordination. In other words, the muscles are capable of normal function-
ing, but faulty programming from the brain prevents the completion of precise, purposeful 
movements.
There are three types of apraxia: limb, oral, and verbal. Limb apraxia is associated with 
volitional movements of the arms and legs. The client may be unable to wave good-bye or 
make a fist on command, even though the muscular strength and range of motion necessary 
to complete the tasks are present and the client is able to automatically perform the tasks. 
The client with oral apraxia may be unable to protrude the tongue or smack the lips voli-
tionally. Oral apraxia is sometimes confused with the third type, verbal apraxia, as they both 
involve orofacial muscles, but they are not the same. Verbal apraxia is a disorder of motor

programming for the production of speech. The client with verbal apraxia has difficulty 
positioning and sequencing muscles involved in the volitional production of phonemes. Cli-
ents may exhibit one, two, or all three types of apraxia. Verbal apraxia is the most common 
type and limb apraxia is the least common type. Form 14-2, ‚ÄúChecklists for Limb, Oral, and  
Verbal Apraxia,‚Äù is provided to help identify the type(s) of apraxia a client exhibits.
This section on the assessment of apraxia focuses on the assessment of apraxia of speech 
(AOS) in adults or as a result of neurological insult. Childhood apraxia of speech, which 
presents itself as a developmental concern, is presented in Chapter 6. AOS may also be re-
ferred to as acquired apraxia, verbal apraxia, or dyspraxia. AOS is characterized by difficulty 
sequencing sounds in connected speech. It can be caused by a stroke, traumatic brain injury, 
dementia, a brain tumor, or a progressive neurological disorder. Shipley, Recor, and Nakamura  
(1990) list 25 characteristics of AOS, including specific diagnostic features. Summarized  
excerpts from their work are as follows:1
 t The number of misarticulations increases as the complexity of the speech task 
increases.
 t Misarticulations occur on both consonants and vowels. Articulation errors occur  
more frequently on consonant clusters than on singletons. Vowels are misarticulated 
less frequently than consonants.
 t Sounds in the initial position are affected more often than sounds in the medial or 
final positions.
 t The frequency of specific sound errors is related, at least in part, to the frequency of 
occurrence in speech. More errors are noted with less frequently occurring sounds.
 t Sound substitutions, omissions, distortions, and additions are all observed. The most 
frequent misarticulations are substitutions and omissions.
 t Articulation errors and struggle behaviors increase as the length and complexity of 
the target word, phrase, or sentence increases.
 t Speech production is variable. It is common for a person with AOS to produce a 
sound, syllable, word, or phrase correctly on one occasion and then incorrectly on 
another. It is also common to observe several different misarticulations for the same 
target sound.
 t Struggling behaviors (such as groping to position the articulators correctly) are  
observed in many patients with AOS.
 t Automatic speech activities (such as counting to 10 or naming the days of the week) 
tend to be easier and more error-free than volitional speech. Reactive speech (such as 
‚Äúthank you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù) is also easier for clients with apraxia to produce.
 t Metathetic errors (errors of sound or syllable transposition) are common. For exam-
ple, the client may say snapknack for knapsack or guspetti for spaghetti.
 t ‚ÄúSyllable collapses‚Äù may occur. Syllable collapses are not commonly reported in the 
literature, but can be common. The client reduces or disrupts the number of syllables 
in motorically complex words or phrases. For example, a client might say glost gers for

Los Angeles Dodgers or be neers for Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In both examples, the num-
ber of syllables is collapsed and the remaining syllables are inaccurately produced.
 t Receptive language abilities are often, but not always, superior to expressive abilities. 
However, the language skills are separate from the apraxia.
 t People with apraxia of speech are usually aware of their incorrect articulatory produc-
tions. Therefore, they may be able to identify many of their own correct and incorrect 
productions without feedback from the clinician.
 t AOS can occur in isolation or in combination with other communicative disorders 
such as dysarthria, delayed speech or language development, aphasia, and hearing loss.
 t Oral apraxia and limb apraxia may or may not be present with verbal apraxia. Often, 
an individual with oral apraxia will also have verbal apraxia.
 t Severity varies from client to client. Some clients cannot volitionally produce a target 
vowel such as /a/. Others have speech that is fine until they attempt to produce mo-
torically challenging phrases such as statistical analysis or theoretical implications.
The ‚ÄúIdentifying Apraxia‚Äù worksheet (Form 14-3) may help confirm or rule out AOS. 
Use this worksheet in conjunction with the ‚ÄúChecklists for Limb, Oral, and Verbal Apraxia‚Äù 
for a more thorough evaluation. Evaluate the client‚Äôs speech during automatic speech, spon-
taneous speech, and oral reading. To obtain a sample of automatic speech, ask the client to 
count to 50, name the days of the week, name the months of the year, or perform a similar 
task. To obtain the spontaneous speech sample, ask the client to describe pictures, describe 
the plot of a movie, or talk about hobbies or other interests. To obtain the oral reading sam-
ple, have the client read a section from a book, a popular magazine, or one or more of the 
reading passages from Chapter 5 of this manual.
Be sure to compare the errors found in different speech contexts. Clients with apraxia of 
speech usually exhibit multiple errors in spontaneous speech and oral reading, whereas fewer 
or no errors are exhibited during automatic speech. If the client exhibits an excessive number 
of errors during automatic speech, dysarthria may be present.
Published tests for the diagnosis of apraxia of speech include:
 t Apraxia Battery for Adults (ABA-2) (Dabul, 2000)
 t Quick Assessment for Apraxia of Speech (Tanner & Culbertson, 1999)
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Dysarthria and apraxia are motor speech disorders caused by neurological damage. Dys-
arthria is characterized by muscular weakness, and apraxia is characterized by poor pro-
gramming of the speech muscles. These motor speech disorders often coexist with other 
neurocognitive disorders, voice or resonance disorders, and/or dysphagia.

any of the muscles used for speech production are also used for chewing and swallow-
ing. Because speech-language pathologists are knowledgeable about oral and pharyn-
geal anatomy and physiology, clinicians frequently evaluate and treat dysphagia (chewing or 
swallowing dysfunction), even when a client does not have a communicative disorder. This 
chapter describes the normal swallow function and procedures for evaluating a client with a 
possible swallowing impairment. Assessment procedures unique to tracheostomized clients 
are also included.
It is critical to exercise caution when completing any evaluation with a client with sus-
pected dysphagia; it is a life-threatening disorder. For example, aspiration pneumonia, which 
can be caused by food or liquid in the lungs, can lead to death. Speech-language pathologists 
will need to work closely with physicians, nurses, and other medically related personnel to 
provide safe client care.

DYSPHAGIA
CHAPTER 15 Assessment of Dysphagia 
OVERVIEW OF A NORMAL SWALLOW
Before evaluating a client for a swallowing disorder, it is important to understand the dynamics 
of a functional swallow. The normal swallow occurs in four phases, each described in the follow-
ing list. The client with dysphagia will exhibit difficulties within one or more of these phases.
1. Oral Preparatory Phase: The food or liquid is manipulated in the oral cavity, chewed 
(if necessary), and made into a bolus, which is sealed with the tongue against the hard 
palate. In infants, sucking occurs during the oral preparatory phase.
2. Oral Phase: The tongue moves the food or liquid toward the back of the mouth  (toward 
the anterior faucial pillars). To achieve this, the tongue presses the bolus against the 
hard palate and squeezes the bolus posteriorly. The oral-preparatory and oral phases 
are voluntary, not reflexive, actions.
3. Pharyngeal Phase: During this phase, the swallow reflex is triggered and the bolus is car-
ried through the pharynx. These simultaneous actions occur: (a) the velopharyngeal port 
closes; (b) the bolus is squeezed to the top of the esophagus (cricopharyngeal sphincter); 
(c) the larynx elevates as the epiglottis, false vocal folds, and true vocal folds close to seal 
the airway; and (d) the cricopharyngeal sphincter relaxes to allow the bolus to enter the 
esophagus.
4. Esophageal Phase: During this fourth and final phase, the bolus is transported through 
the esophagus into the stomach.
The first three phases are of most interest for speech-language pathologists. Problems 
with the fourth phase (esophageal phase) are treated medically. Figure 15-1 depicts the first 
three stages of a normal swallow.

Anatomical structures involved in swallowing are presented in Figure 15-2. The illus-
tration highlights differences between an adult and an infant. Individual structures change 
and mature at different rates. Logically, when evaluating pediatric clients it is necessary to 
consider the child‚Äôs age and stage of maturation.
A sequence of normal development related to feeding and swallowing is presented next. 
The developmental milestones include physical changes, refinement of oral motor skills, and 
social behaviors that influence feeding and swallowing (data from Arvedson & Brodsky, 2002; 
Hall, 2001; Leonard & Kendall, 1997; Swigert, 1998). When evaluating a child who was born 
prematurely, it is important to consider the child‚Äôs adjusted age rather than chronological 
age. This is calculated by subtracting the number of weeks premature by the child‚Äôs current 
chronological age. For example, a 12-week old infant born at 34 weeks‚Äô gestation (6 weeks 
premature) will have an adjusted age of 6 weeks. Therefore, assuming no other complicating 
factors, this child‚Äôs development will be more similar to a 6-week-old than a 12-week-old.
Gestational Period
Physical Development
 t Primal sucking reflex is present (11 weeks).
 t Primal swallow reflex is present (27 weeks).
 t Phasic bite reflex is developed (28 weeks).
 t Transverse tongue reflex is developed (28 weeks).
 t Rooting reflex is developed (32 weeks).
 t Suck-swallow reflex is strong (37 weeks).
 t Tongue protrusion reflex is developed (38‚Äì40 weeks).
Chewing and Swallowing Skills
 t Strength and coordination of swallow is adequate to begin oral feeding in a preterm 
infant at 34‚Äì35 weeks‚Äô gestation.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF PEDIATRIC DYSPHAGIA
We cannot overstate the importance of specific training and study of dysphagia prior to 
administering a pediatric dysphagia assessment. The information and forms presented in 
this manual are basic procedures for evaluating pediatric clients. The specific and complex 
needs of individual children cannot be presented in a text of this nature; therefore we cau-
tion against using this text as a sole source of information for evaluating children with this 
potentially life-endangering disorder. Materials recommended in the ‚ÄúSources of Additional 
Information‚Äù at the end of this chapter are a few of the many resources available for increas-
ing knowledge and skill in this area.

DYSPHAGIA
CHAPTER 15 Assessment of Dysphagia 
The assessment of pediatric dysphagia necessarily begins with a thorough case history. 
Knowing the child‚Äôs history and current status will lay the foundation for the remainder of 
the clinical assessment. Forms 15-1, ‚ÄúPediatric Dysphagia Case History Form and Caregiver 
Questionnaire‚ÄîInfant 0‚Äì6 Months,‚Äù and 15-2, ‚ÄúPediatric Dysphagia Case History Form 
and Caregiver Questionnaire,‚Äù are provided to guide this data collection. The first form is 
appropriate for infants who have not transitioned to solid foods (0 to 4‚Äì6 months of age). 
The second form can be used for all children (ignore irrelevant sections according to child‚Äôs 
age and situation). Either form can be completed by a caregiver prior to the assessment or 
the data can be collected during an information-gathering interview. Information about the 
infant‚Äôs or child‚Äôs current status can also be obtained by reviewing the client‚Äôs medical records 
and consulting other professionals involved in the child‚Äôs care. Specifically:
 t Identify the child‚Äôs medical status. For example, was the child born prematurely? Are 
there neurological concerns? Are there craniofacial abnormalities? Does the child 
have a history of aspiration pneumonia? Has the child been losing weight?
 t Identify the child‚Äôs feeding status. For example, what is the child‚Äôs typical diet? How is 
the child positioned during meals? Does the child use adaptive equipment? Has the 
child been refusing to eat? Does the child self-feed?
 t Be aware of dietary restrictions. For example, does the child have food allergies? Is the child 
diabetic? Be careful not to present food or liquids that could be harmful to the child.
 t Converse with caregivers. For example, learn about the child‚Äôs feeding/swallowing 
problems from the caregiver‚Äôs point of view. Discern the social aspects of mealtimes 
in the home. Ask the caregiver to bring feeding equipment (chairs, bottles, spoons, 
etc.) that the child typically uses. Interview the child‚Äôs pediatrician, nurses, or dietitian 
to obtain critical information.
Form 15-3, ‚ÄúPediatric Dysphagia Clinical Evalution,‚Äù will help with the completion of the 
clinical portion of the evaluation. A majority of the clinical assessment involves observation of 
current physical and feeding status. The clinician should also stimulate for improved feeding 
and swallowing ability by introducing various compensatory techniques. In many instances, 
the case history and clinical assessment are sufficient for informed diagnostic decisions and 
recommendations. In other situations, instrumental assessment will also be necessary. Meth-
ods of instrumentally assessing swallowing function are described later in this chapter.
Administration and Interpretation
Pediatric clients who are being assessed for dysphagia vary widely in age, medical and physi-
cal status, and feeding status. Clients served may be premature babies, older school-age chil-
dren, or somewhere in between; therefore the assessment process will necessarily be modified 
depending upon the age and diagnosis of each child. The assessment worksheet provided in 
this manual can be adapted for varying situations and needs.
Observing alertness is particularly important when assessing infants. Alertness measures 
provide information about the infant‚Äôs ability to prepare for and attend to feeding. Six states 
of consciousness identified by pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton (Als et al., 1977; Brazelton & 
Nugent, 1995) are widely used to define levels of alertness. They are:
1. Deep sleep: Respiratory patterns are deep and regular; the eyes are closed with no rapid 
eye movements. The body is completely relaxed. The infant may startle, but will not 
rouse. The infant is relatively ‚Äúunreachable.‚Äù

2. Active sleep: Respiratory patterns alternate between regular and irregular. The eyes are 
closed, although rapid eye movements may be noted under the eyelids and the infant 
may open and close the eyes on occasion. Random spontaneous movements of the 
limbs may occur. Facial movements may be observed.
3. Drowsy/in-between state: A dazed expression is observed, with fully or partially open 
eyes. Smooth movements of the limbs may occur. Respiration is regular. Infant arouses 
quickly to stimulation.
4. Awake/alert: Eyes are alert and bright. The infant‚Äôs body is mostly still and the face is 
attentive. The infant responds predictably to auditory and visual stimuli.
5. Alert agitated: Eyes are alert. The body is active. Movements are often disorganized 
and jerky. The infant is fussy, although readily soothed, in this state. Fussing may esca-
late to the next state, crying.
6. Crying: Intense crying with difficulty comforting. The face may redden and limbs may 
exhibit tremor-like shaking.
In addition to alertness, physiologic status is also very important to observe when assess-
ing for dysphagia. Physiologic status includes respiratory rate, oxygen saturation levels, and 
heart rate. Respiratory problems are among the most common causes of dysphagia in young 
children (Hall, 2001). Observing respiratory patterns, particularly noting changes that occur 
during and after feeding, provides information about the child‚Äôs ability to coordinate breath-
ing and eating. A child who is unable to breathe adequately or protect the airway during oral 
intake will need to be tube fed. Problematic breathing patterns include:
 t Apnea: Sporadic cessation of breathing
 t Belly breathing: Extreme abdominal movement (Note: This may be a normal pattern 
for infants 0‚Äì5 months of age.)
 t Reverse breathing: Abdomen expands on exhalation and compresses on inhalation
 t Thoracic breathing: Extreme upper chest movement
 t Irregular breathing: Absence of a normal pattern
 t Shallow breathing: Minimal movement
 t Gulping: Rapid and short inhalations with slight backward head movement
Other aspects of physiologic status such as oxygen saturation levels, heart rates, and  
respiratory rates can also be noted when the child is hooked up to monitors. Nursing staff can 
assist in reading monitors and interpreting results. Note changes that coincide with or follow 
oral feeding. Table 15-1 presents normal physiologic data for full-term and preterm infants.

DYSPHAGIA
CHAPTER 15 Assessment of Dysphagia 
Observing sucking is another important procedure when evaluating infants for 
 dysphagia. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) is a normal and important infant behavior; it is 
a prerequisite for normal nutritive sucking. NNS occurs in a rhythmic, organized pattern 
called a burst. Typically, an infant will suck non-nutritively in bursts of six to eight sucks in 
3‚Äì4  seconds, swallow, then pause for 6‚Äì7 seconds to breathe and rest before repeating the 
sequence.  Cycles that deviate from this may indicate poor endurance or poor coordination 
of the suck- swallow-breathe pattern. An infant who demonstrates respiratory difficulties 
during NNS is likely to show even greater struggle during nutritive sucking. The infant‚Äôs 
suck strength can be assessed by placing a gloved finger in the mouth, pad side down. Note 
how well the tongue cups the finger, whether lip closure is obtained, and the strength of 
the suck.
The nutritive sucking (NS) pattern is slower than the NNS pattern. NNS is usually two 
sucks per second, while NS is one per second. A newborn will suck once, swallow once, and 
breathe once per burst. The number of sucks per burst will increase to two to three sucks 
in the first few months as the oral cavity enlarges. The infant will maintain this pattern 
for 60‚Äì80 continuous seconds before pausing to rest. As the infant becomes satiated and 
fatigued, the pattern usually slows down, with fewer sucks and longer pauses by the end of 
the feeding. It may be difficult to assess strength and efficiency of the suck during nutritive 
sucking, especially if the infant is breast feeding. Generally, if the infant has to work hard to 
express fluid or if the infant is unable to maintain an organized sucking pattern, he or she 
may need supplemental feeding and/or a bottle with a modified nipple.
Several infantile reflexes should be present at birth. These primitive reflexes cease during 
the first several months of life. The absence of one or more of these reflexes, or their persis-
tence beyond the age of normal cessation, may indicate neurological impairment. Table 15-2 
highlights primitive reflexes that affect feeding and swallowing. Methods of eliciting the 
reflex, as well as the normal age of cessation, are included. Keep in mind that some reflexes 
are necessary for proper feeding and swallowing development, whereas others interfere and 
have a negative impact. Points of clinical significance are described as follows:
 t Asymmetric tonic neck reflex (also called tonic neck reflex or fencing reflex): The presence 
of this reflex may interfere with hand-to-mouth feeding.
 t Babkin (also called hand-mouth reflex): The hand-to-mouth action may aid the ability 
to receive food into the mouth.
 t Gag reflex: The gag reflex may or may not be related to swallowing. A hyperactive or 
hypoactive gag may indicate neurological impairment.
 t Moro reflex (also called startle reflex): Presence of this reflex may interfere with head 
control, attention, or hand-to-mouth action for feeding.
 t Palmar grasp: Presence of this reflex may aid early finger feeding and ability to hold a 
bottle, cup, or spoon.
 t Phasic bite reflex: This reflex may assist with the development of the early munching 
patterns.
 t Rooting reflex: Rooting helps the infant‚Äôs mouth find the nipple in early feeding. The 
infant will continue to root until he or she latches on.
 t Sucking or suckling reflex: This reflex is important for early breast or bottle feeding 
and later for spoon feeding and cup drinking. The infant instinctively and rhythmi-
cally compresses the nipple and draws liquid out, or draws food from a spoon or cup. 
The term sucking is often generically used to refer to both sucking and suckling. The

DYSPHAGIA
CHAPTER 15 Assessment of Dysphagia 
primary difference between sucking and suckling is the motion of the tongue, which 
moves forward-back during suckling and up-down during sucking.
 t Swallow reflex (also called pharyngeal swallow): This reflex is triggered when a bolus 
of food enters the pharynx. The reflex protects the airway and propels the bolus into 
the esophagus.
 t Tongue thrust reflex: This reflex provides protection against choking in the early 
months. Introduction of spoon feeding of solids cannot productively occur until the 
tongue thrust reflex has ceased.
Abnormal reflexes may also be observed during a dysphagia assessment. Presence of one 
or more of these reflexes may indicate neurological damage; some are common among chil-
dren with cerebral palsy. Abnormal reflexes include:
 t Palmomental reflex: When the palm of the infant‚Äôs hand is scratched at the base of the 
thumb, the chin and corner of the mouth contract unilaterally on the same side as the 
stimulation. This reflex diminishes by 4 months of age.
 t Tonic bite reflex: The jaw clamps down when teeth or gums are stimulated, and the 
child may have difficulty releasing it. Firm pressure applied bilaterally to the tem-
poromandibular joints may release the bite. Presence of this reflex interferes with ap-
propriate oral feeding and manipulation of a nipple, cup, or utensil in the oral cavity.
 t Jaw thrust: The lower jaw is forcefully extended down and appears to be stuck open. 
It causes difficulty in receiving and keeping food in the mouth.
 t Tongue retraction: The tongue is pulled back into the hypopharynx, while the tip of 
the tongue may be held against the hard palate. The child will have difficulty remov-
ing food from a utensil and using the tongue for chewing and swallowing.
 t Tongue thrust: Strong abnormal, and sometimes repetitive, protrusion of the tongue in re-
sponse to oral stimulation. It interferes with transport of food and liquid to the pharynx. 
The reflex is abnormal if present after 18 months of age. It should not to be confused 
with the normal primitive tongue thrust reflex that diminishes by 6 months of age.
 t Lip retraction: Lips are tightly pulled back in a horizontal line. The child will have 
difficulty sucking from a nipple, removing food from a spoon, cup drinking, and 
keeping food in the mouth while chewing.
 t Nasal regurgitation: Swallowed bolus flows back through the nose. It is associated 
with abnormal function of the velopharynx.
The assessment of the child‚Äôs orofacial structures focuses primarily on behaviors or deficits 
that may impair the child‚Äôs ability to safely feed, chew, or swallow. With infants, this portion 
of the assessment is done primarily through observation of the structures at rest. Function 
can be more readily assessed in older children who are capable of imitating oral movements 
or responding to directives. Clinical significance of findings include the following:
 t Structural abnormalities often impair feeding or swallowing ability. For example, 
clefts of the soft or hard palate usually interfere with sucking ability. Cleft lip may 
result in poor labial seal. Abnormalities such as a tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula and 
esophageal atresia preclude safe oral feeding.
 t Oral-motor weakness and/or incoordination may result in poor sucking ability and 
oral control of the bolus. For example, food or liquid may spill out of the child‚Äôs

mouth or pool in the mouth after swallowing. The child may be unable to latch onto 
a nipple or achieve adequate intra-oral pressure for sucking.
 t Abnormal muscle tone may impair oral awareness, sucking ability, manipulation of 
the bolus, or self-feeding. For example, flaccid tone may result in inadequate  stability 
of head or body. The child may be ‚Äúfloppy‚Äù and unable to feed, chew, or swallow.  
Tension may cause difficulty bringing the hand to the mouth. Abnormal reflexes  
are likely to be noted, such as jaw thrust, tonic bite, and tongue retraction.
 t Reduced or abnormal movement of oral structures may impair chewing and swallow-
ing ability. For example, restricted range of jaw movement may cause difficulty latch-
ing onto a nipple or biting into solid foods.
 t Facial and oral sensitivity may impair a child‚Äôs ability to feed, chew, or swallow.  
Reduced sensitivity may reduce awareness and control of food on the face or in the 
oral cavity. A child who is hypersensitive may refuse to eat.
 t Coughing, choking, or wet vocal quality indicate penetration of food or liquid into 
the airway.
An infant begins eating solid foods usually between 4 and 6 months of age. Once that 
milestone is met, it is necessary to make observations about feeding, chewing, and swallow-
ing ability with solid foods, and later with cup drinking. Clinical expectations vary depend-
ing on the child‚Äôs age, medical status, and physical maturity. We recommend referring to the 
sequence of normal development presented earlier in this chapter to enlighten this portion 
of the assessment. Assess the child‚Äôs ability to chew and swallow different textures, progress-
ing from the least to most difficult to manage. Note chewing efficiency, oral motor strength 
and coordination, control of bolus, and pharyngeal behaviors for each texture presented.  
Also observe the child‚Äôs posture, attention, and ability to self-feed. When assessing older 
children, it may be appropriate to refer to the adult clinical assessment of dysphagia section 
of this chapter for additional diagnostic information.
When appropriate, clinicians should attempt to stimulate improved feeding and swallow-
ing as part of the assessment process. Compensatory or facilitative techniques may include:
 t Modify posture: For example, incline or recline the head, put the child in a prone po-
sition, or have the child positioned fully upright. Any of these may improve jaw sta-
bility or reduce clenching, or minimize tongue or jaw thrusting or retraction. It may 
improve lip motion and seal, or eliminate nasopharyngeal reflux. It also may improve 
airway protection or improve head control.
 t Manually support jaw, lips, or cheeks: This may improve a weak suck, assist with labial 
seal, or minimize jaw or tongue thrusting or retraction. Strategically placed support or 
pressure can also minimize clenching, reduce anterior loss of food, or reduce pooling.
 t Provide adaptive equipment: For example, a modified nipple may assist suck, improve 
organization of suck, or enable desired respiratory function. A maroon spoon  
(flat-bowled) may inhibit a tonic bite reflex. A child with poor orofacial strength  
may be able to drink successfully from a straw. An angle-neck bottle may allow a 
more desirable feeding posture.
 t Alter food: For example, thicker liquids and foods may improve oral control of the 
bolus or reduce reflux. Some children may respond better to bland foods with neutral 
smells, whereas others may do better while eating spicy or tart foods with stronger 
smells. Modifying food temperature may also improve swallowing.

543
DYSPHAGIA
CHAPTER 15 Assessment of Dysphagia 
 t Alter feeding environment: For example, dimming the lights and playing quiet and 
calming music or a repetitive noise may calm a child who is alert but unfocused. A 
calm environment may also help improve an infant‚Äôs suck-swallow-breathe organi-
zation and feeding endurance. Less frequently, but occasionally, a child may require a 
more stimulating environment to attain a desired level of alertness.
 t Manipulate pace of feeding: For example, pull or tip the nipple to interrupt flow. Allow 
frequent pauses to allow the child to rest, reorganize, and maintain respiratory safety.
 t Modify food placement: For example, touching the lower lip with the spoon before 
placing it into the mouth may inhibit a tonic bite reflex.
 t Stimulate the face or oral structures: For example, massaging the cheeks may minimize 
lip retraction, heighten facial sensitivity, or calm the child. Oral stimulation may in-
crease the child‚Äôs readiness for feeding or improve lip closure.
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF ADULT DYSPHAGIA
Form 15-4, ‚ÄúAdult Bedside Dysphagia Evaluation‚Äù will help with the completion of an adult 
client (bedside) assessment of dysphagia. The form is divided into two segments. The first 
involves information gathering and an orofacial evaluation specific to dysphagia. The second 
involves presentation of foods or liquids.1 It is not necessary to administer both segments 
with all dysphagic clients. If the client is not alert or if the type of dysphagia is already 
known, complete the evaluation without presenting food or liquids. If food or liquid are 
administered orally, and the client exhibits signs of aspiration after swallowing (i.e., choking, 
coughing, wet voice quality), discontinue the evaluation. Then notify the physician to mod-
ify or discontinue oral feeding. Proceed with therapy or refer the client for a radiographic 
examination to diagnose the disorder more specifically. Be aware that silent aspiration can 
occur. In this case, the client does not exhibit the outward signs of aspiration. If silent aspi-
ration is suspected, a radiographic study will be necessary to confirm or rule out dysphagia.
Administration and Interpretation
Before beginning the direct assessment, gather thorough information about the client‚Äôs cur-
rent status. The best way to obtain this information is to consult with the client‚Äôs physician 
or nurse or review the client‚Äôs medical records. Sometimes a family member or the client can 
provide this information. Specifically:
 t Identify the client‚Äôs neurological and medical status. For example, was there a recent 
stroke? Does the client have Parkinsonism? Are there any neurological indicators? Does 
the client have a history of aspiration pneumonia? Does the client wear dentures?
 t Identify the client‚Äôs feeding status. For example, is the client on a regular diet? Puree 
diet? Fed via a nasogastric tube? Has the client been losing weight or refusing to eat? 
Has the client been experiencing backflow, reflux, or vomiting after meals? Is the 
 client fed by someone else? Who will feed the client after discharge from a hospital?
 1.  Caution: Do not administer the feeding portion of the evaluation without some prior training and experience or without the 
 direct supervision of a trained and knowledgeable professional.

PART III Resources for Assessing Communicative Disorders
 t Be aware of dietary limitations. For example, does the client have food allergies? Is 
the client diabetic? Obtain this information so that foods or liquids are not presented 
that could be detrimental to the client.
 t Identify the client‚Äôs cognitive status. For example, is the client alert? Is the client able 
to follow commands? Is there dementia? Will the client be able to cooperate in ther-
apy if treatment is indicated?
Once this preliminary information has been gathered, assess the integrity of the oral 
mechanism. This assessment is similar to the orofacial evaluation administered as a standard 
procedure for most communicative disorders, but for a dysphagic client it is important to 
make special note of behaviors or deficits that may affect the person‚Äôs ability to safely chew 
and swallow.
 t Poor oral control may be a result of weak and/or uncoordinated lips, tongue, or jaw, or 
poor oral sensitivity. The client may have difficulty forming a bolus and manipulating 
the food for chewing or propelling the food back for swallowing, or difficulty keeping 
the food in the mouth. If the weakness is unilateral, the food typically leaks from the 
weaker side.
 t Chewing difficulties may be caused by incoordination or weakness of the jaw. Also, 
normal food textures may not be appropriate for a client if teeth are absent or if the 
client‚Äôs dentures do not fit properly.
 t Nasal regurgitation may occur if velopharyngeal movement is impaired.
 t Penetration of the bolus into the airway or complete aspiration may result from weak 
or uncoordinated laryngeal musculature. If the larynx does not have normal range of 
motion or if the laryngeal reflex is slow or delayed, the airway is at risk of being ob-
structed during swallowing. Also, the client may not be able to productively clear food 
out of the airway if aspiration does occur.
For the second segment of the bedside dysphagia evaluation, present small bites of 
different textures of food or liquids in order from the easiest to manage (puree) to the 
most difficult to manage (liquid). A puree texture (e.g., mashed potatoes or applesauce) 
easily forms into a cohesive bolus and does not need to be chewed. Soft-texture foods 
(e.g., chopped meat with gravy, or cooked beans) require some chewing, but are easier to 
manage than regular textures. Regular-texture foods (e.g., toast or chunks of meat) are the 
most difficult foods to chew and prepare into a bolus. Liquids are the most difficult to 
manipulate because swallowing liquids involves the least voluntary and reflexive control. 
Assess the client‚Äôs ability to manage liquids presented from a spoon, a straw, and a cup. Do 
not present liquids at all to a client who has difficulty with puree textures.
Part II of the bedside evaluation form lists behaviors that may be observed during the 
presentation of foods or liquids. The behaviors are grouped according to the applicable phase 
of the normal swallow. Suspect dysphagia if the client is having difficulty with one or several 
of these behaviors.
Oral Preparatory Phase
 t Food or liquid spills out of the mouth because of poor labial seal. Normally it leaks 
from the weaker side of the mouth if unilateral paresis is present.
 t Food is not chewed adequately because of reduced mandibular strength, reduced lin-
gual strength and range of motion, or reduced oral sensitivity.

DYSPHAGIA
CHAPTER 15 Assessment of Dysphagia 
 t A proper bolus is not formed because of reduced lingual strength and range of mo-
tion or reduced oral sensitivity.
 t Residual food is pocketed between the cheeks and tongue (lateral sulcus) after the 
swallow due to reduced buccal tension.
 t Residual food is pocketed under the tongue after the swallow due to reduced lingual 
strength.
Oral Phase
 t Food or liquid spills out of the mouth due to poor labial and lingual seal. Normally, 
leakage occurs from the weaker side of the mouth if unilateral paresis is present.
 t Food or liquid falls over the base of the tongue and may be aspirated because of re-
duced tongue strength or range of motion, or reduced oral sensitivity.
 t Residual food is pocketed between the cheeks and tongue (lateral sulcus) after the 
swallow due to reduced buccal tension.
 t Residual food is pocketed under the tongue after the swallow due to reduced lingual 
strength.
 t Residual food is present on the hard palate after the swallow because of reduced lin-
gual elevation.
 t Food is spit out of the oral cavity from tongue thrusting.
 t The time taken to move the bolus posteriorly is abnormally slow.
 t Excessive tongue movement is noted during the swallow due to lingual incoordination, 
or as a compensatory strategy due to a delayed or absent swallow reflex.
Pharyngeal Phase
 t Coughing, choking, or a wet voice quality occurs when food or liquid enters the 
airway because of a delayed or absent swallow reflex, reduced laryngeal elevation, 
reduced laryngeal closure, reduced pharyngeal peristalsis (squeezing), or cricophar-
yngeal dysfunction. With some clients, these outward symptoms do not occur even 
when aspiration has taken place.
 t Nasal regurgitation occurs due to inadequate velopharyngeal closure.
 t Excessive saliva and mucus are present due to aspiration and the body‚Äôs attempt to 
clear away the foreign material.
Esophageal Phase
 t Coughing, choking, or a wet voice quality occurs when food or liquid enters the 
esophagus, is partially regurgitated, and then enters the airway because of cricophar-
yngeal dysfunction.
 t Regurgitation occurs due to cricopharyngeal dysfunction.
BEDSIDE ASSESSMENT OF THE TRACHEOSTOMIZED CLIENT
When evaluating a tracheostomized client, the swallowing evaluation is modified some-
what. The presence of a tracheostomy may change the pharyngeal pressures that contribute 
to a functional swallow. Also, the actual hardware can obscure a client‚Äôs ability to swallow

normally and safely. Due to complicating factors related to the tracheostomy, it is critical 
that the client‚Äôs physician and respiratory therapist be consulted prior to administering the 
swallowing assessment. The client‚Äôs physician can provide valuable information about the 
client‚Äôs history and current medical status, and the respiratory therapist can provide infor-
mation about the client‚Äôs respiratory status. If possible, have the respiratory therapist present 
during portions of the evaluation. He or she can monitor the client‚Äôs ventilation status, assist 
with cuff deflation and inflation, and suction as needed.
The first portion of the evaluation is the case history. Review medical records, commu-
nicate with other caregivers, and talk to the client to gather as much relevant information  
as possible. In addition to more traditional case history queries, the clinician will also want 
to ask:
 t Why is the person tracheostomized?
 t How long has the tracheostomy been in place?
 t What kind of tracheostomy tube is present? Is it cuffed? Is it fenestrated?
 t What stage, if any, of weaning is the client in?
 t What is the client‚Äôs medical status?
Next, complete the oral-motor assessment. Apply traditional evaluation techniques for 
determining lip, tongue, and jaw integrity. Occlude the opening of the tracheostomy briefly 
and ask the client to say ‚Äúah‚Äù to see if the client can phonate. If the tracheostomy is cuffed, 
it will need to be deflated to continue the assessment. It is vitally important that the client‚Äôs 
physician authorize cuff deflation. Due to other health issues, cuff deflation may be life 
threatening. If this is the case, postpone further laryngeal evaluation and presentation of 
food or liquid until the client is more medically stable. If the client can tolerate cuff defla-
tion, deflate the cuff and continue the assessment of laryngeal function.
The Blue-Dye Test
The blue-dye test is a useful tool for determining whether a client is aspirating. Ideally, a 
blue-dye test is administered over several sessions and days with only one texture introduced 
per day. This allows the most accurate assessment of the client‚Äôs abilities to manage varying 
textures. Follow these five steps to administer a blue-dye test:
1. Ask a respiratory therapist to suction the mouth, the tracheostomy region, and the 
lungs. If the cuff is still inflated, deflate it now (with physician approval).
2. Add blue food coloring to food or liquid, preferably testing only one texture at a time.
3. Present small amounts of the blue-dyed food or liquid to the client and occlude the 
tracheostomy tube during every swallow.
4. Suction again and look for the presence of blue dye in the tracheal region.
5. Repeat suctioning every 15 minutes for the next hour, and monitor the tracheal area 
for blue dye for the next 24 hours. It is important to let other caregivers know that a 
blue-dye test is in progress so that they can continue to watch for blue coloring in your 
absence. Form 15-5, ‚ÄúBlue-Dye Test Worksheet,‚Äù can be posted at the client‚Äôs bedside 
to assist in this process. Interpretation: Any positive identification of blue food coloring 
in the tracheal region indicates that some degree of aspiration has occurred.

DYSPHAGIA
CHAPTER 15 Assessment of Dysphagia 
The blue-dye test can also be used to assess a client‚Äôs management of his or her saliva 
even if no food or liquid is introduced. Dab a small amount of blue food coloring on the 
client‚Äôs tongue and monitor the tracheal region in the same manner as if food or liquid had 
been introduced.
The blue-dye test is a very useful assessment tool, but we must offer this word of cau-
tion concerning its reliability: the presence of blue dye in the tracheal region will positively 
identify aspiration; however, the absence of blue dye does not necessarily mean the absence 
of aspiration (Dikeman & Kazandjian, 2003). For this reason, do not use the blue-dye test 
exclusively to assess for dysphagia.
GRAPHIC IMAGING
Clinical assessment is often inadequate for diagnosing dysphagia. There are two widely used 
approaches for graphically viewing swallowing function. These are videofluoroscopy and 
videoendoscopy. Both approaches allow later in-depth analysis of swallowing ability by way 
of videotaping the studies.
Videofluoroscopy
A videofluorographic swallowing study (VFSS) is a radiographic examination that provides 
a motion X-ray of the swallow. The procedure may also be called a modified barium swallow 
(MBS) or oral pharyngeal motility study (OPMS). During the assessment, the client is pre-
sented with barium mixture of varying consistencies (e.g., thin liquid, thick liquid, pudding) 
and sometimes food coated with barium (e.g., cracker, banana). The client swallows the 
barium mixture as the examiner observes the progression of the barium through the oral and 
pharyngeal cavities and into the esophagus.
The test allows the clinician to determine whether a client is aspirating or penetrating 
the airway. It also helps to identify the specific site of aspiration or penetration, its cause, 
and possible strategies that will increase swallowing safety for the client, such as changing 
head positioning or modifying bolus size. Although the examination is administered by a 
radiologist, the speech-language pathologist should make explicit requests about position-
ing, food consistencies, and compensatory strategies that need to be included as part of the 
study. When possible, the clinician should be present during the examination to maximize 
its diagnostic benefits.
Videofluoroscopy is currently the preferred method of graphic assessment because it 
provides more complete diagnostic information. However, in many situations videofluoros-
copy is not feasible. Videoendoscopy is an acceptable alternative in these situations.
Videoendoscopy
Videoendoscopy uses endoscopic equipment to allow the clinician to view the oral and phar-
yngeal structures before and after the swallow. The procedure is also called fiberoptic endo-
scopic examination of swallowing (FEES). During the assessment, a small, flexible scope is 
passed through the nose down to the level of the soft palate. The scope allows the clinician 
to view pharyngeal and laryngeal structures before and after swallowing, but not during the

swallow. Various food consistencies and textures can be presented, or the clinician can view 
the client‚Äôs ability to manage saliva in the absence of food or liquid.
The test allows the clinician to monitor overall condition of the swallow, whether there 
is adequate airway protection, overall timing of the swallow, whether spillage occurs before 
the swallow, presence of residue after the swallow, ability to clear residue, presence of reflux, 
and presence of aspiration. Strategies for improving swallow safety and efficiency by way 
of postural changes, diet modifications, and swallowing maneuvers can also be identified. 
 Videoendoscopy can be done as a bedside procedure.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Although dysphagia is not a disorder of communication, its evaluation and treatment 
are frequently under the domain of the speech-language pathologist. It is a potentially 
life-threatening disorder and should be evaluated with caution and a thorough understand-
ing of dysphagia. It is important to communicate regularly with a client‚Äôs physician and 
other health care professionals so that the client‚Äôs health and safety are not jeopardized.  
A clinical or bedside evaluation is often adequate for making diagnostic conclusions about a 
client with suspected dysphagia; however, there are cases when a graphic study is necessary 
for completing a thorough examination.
There are diagnostic procedures unique to tracheostomized clients that are followed 
when completing a dysphagia evaluation. The client‚Äôs physician and respiratory therapist 
are invaluable sources of assistance and information. It is especially important to discuss 
the assessment protocol with the physician prior to completing the evaluation to determine 
whether the client is medically stable enough to tolerate the assessment. The blue-dye test 
can be administered to detect aspiration in a tracheostomized client.

T
he assessment of hearing is within the professional province of the audiologist, not the 
speech-language pathologist. However, the speech-language clinician is interested in clients‚Äô 
hearing abilities since hearing loss directly affects the development or maintenance of optimal 
communicative skills. Specifically, we are interested in the effects of hearing impairment on:
 t The assessment of communicative development and abilities
 t The development or maintenance of a communication disorder
 t Treatment recommendations and the selection of appropriate treatment procedures 
and target behaviors
 t Academic, social, or vocational development
Even though speech-language pathologists are limited to screening a client‚Äôs hearing, it 
is important for clinicians to understand hearing loss, audiological assessment procedures, 
interpretation of findings Clinicians, and implications of hearing loss on speech and lan-
guage development.
OVERVIEW OF COMMON HEARING PATHOLOGIES
There are three types of hearing loss: conductive, sensorineural, and mixed. In addition, it 
is helpful for speech-language pathologists to have basic knowledge of auditory processing 
disorder and retrocochlear pathology.  These conditions are described in this section. To help 
with foundational understanding of ear anatomy in relation to these pathologies, a pictorial 
representation of the ear is presented in Figure 16-1.

CHAPTER 16 Hearing Considerations
HEARING 
CONSIDERATIONS
Conductive Hearing Loss
A conductive hearing loss occurs when the transmission of sound is interrupted. This occurs 
in the outer ear or, more frequently, in the middle ear. In children, the most common cause of 
middle ear dysfunction is otitis media, or middle ear infection. (See ‚ÄúMedical Conditions Asso-
ciated with Communicative Disorders‚Äù in Chapter 17 and the Glossary for descriptions of  otitis 
media.) In adults, the most common cause of conductive hearing impairment is  otosclerosis, 
a disease of the middle ear ossicles that may cause the footplate of the stapes to attach to the 
oval window. The most common cause of conductive hearing impairment among the geriatric 
population is ear canal collapse. Other less common causes of conductive hearing loss are aural 
atresia (closed external auditory canal), stenosis (narrow external auditory canal), and external 
otitis (infected and swollen external auditory canal; also known as ‚Äúswimmer‚Äôs ear‚Äù).
Sensorineural Hearing Loss
A sensorineural hearing loss occurs when the hair cells of the cochlea or the acoustic nerve 
(CN VIII) are damaged. The impairment is associated with the loss of hearing through bone 
conduction, and it is considered a permanent impairment. Causes of sensorineural hearing 
loss include:
 t Ototoxicity, or damage from drugs (including certain antibiotics)
 t Infections, such as meningitis or maternal rubella
 t Genetic factors, such as certain birth defects that result in partially developed or 
missing parts of the cochlea or auditory nerve
 t Anoxia or syphilis contracted during the birth delivery
 t Presbycusis associated with the effects of aging
 t M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease, a unilateral disease that is characterized by vertigo (dizziness) and 
tinnitus (noise in the ear)
Mixed Hearing Loss
Mixed hearing losses involve a combination of a conductive and sensorineural loss. Both air and 
bone conduction pathways are involved so the hearing loss is partially conductive and partially 
sensorineural, but the hearing by bone conduction is typically the better of the two. The sensori-
neural component of a mixed hearing loss determines the amount of speech sound distortion 
that is present. Thus, bone conduction audiograms are the best indicators of the degree of diffi-
culty a client will have recognizing and discriminating speech, even if it has been amplified.
Auditory Processing Disorder
Auditory processing disorder (APD), also called central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), 
is a neurological condition that stems from problems in the auditory center of the brain. 
Hearing acuity and intelligence are normal, yet the client is unable to process auditory infor-
mation normally. Clients with APD may have difficulties detecting or localizing sound or 
discriminating speech. Noisy or highly distracting environments tend to worsen the difficul-
ties. Tinnitus may also be present.
Children with APD often struggle academically. They may be unable to follow complex 
verbal directions, exhibit spelling and reading deficits, have difficulty engaging in class dis-
cussions, or have difficulty focusing and completing assignments. The symptoms of APD

are similar to those of other conditions, such as dyslexia, attention deficit disorder, autism 
spectrum disorder, or specific language impairment. It is important to differentiate APD 
from other disorders, and to be aware that APD may coexist with these other conditions. 
Although the assessment and diagnosis of APD is primarily the responsibility of an audiol-
ogist, a speech-language pathologist may participate as a member of a diagnostic team.
Retrocochlear Pathology
Retrocochlear pathology involves damage to the nerve fibers along the ascending auditory path-
ways from the internal auditory meatus to the cortex. This damage is often, but not always, the 
result of a tumor. Depending on the pathology, a hearing loss may or may not be detected when 
hearing is tested with pure tones. However, many clients with retrocochlear pathology perform 
poorly on speech-recognition tasks, particularly when the speech signal is altered by filtering, 
adding noise, and so forth. Several speech-recognition tests as well as auditory brainstem re-
sponse (ABR) tests and other auditory evoked potentials help identify the presence of retroco-
chlear pathology. Such testing is clearly beyond the province of the speech-language pathologist 
and, depending on their training and the equipment available to them, some audiologists as well.
STANDARD CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING LOSS 
AND¬†THE¬†EFFECTS ON COMMUNICATIVE DEVELOPMENT
Hearing losses vary in severity from individual to individual. A frequently used standard 
classification system for describing severity levels of hearing loss is presented in Table 16-1. 
The classifications described are related to average hearing levels obtained during pure tone 
audiometry. Because hearing losses vary immensely, their influence on speech and language 
development also varies. Logically, the greater the severity of the hearing loss, the greater its 
potential negative impact on speech and language. You can easily see this relationship in Table 
16-2, which presents the rehabilitative and communicative effects of hearing loss at different 
severity levels. Keep in mind that the guidelines are general. Hearing loss affects individuals 
differently, regardless of severity, and specific intervention is dependent on such factors as:
 t The type of loss
 t The dB levels and frequencies affected
 t Age of onset

 t The client‚Äôs age when the loss was diagnosed
 t Previous intervention (e.g., therapy or educational placement, type of intervention, 
communication mode)
 t Medical intervention (e.g., ongoing, sporadic)
 t The client‚Äôs intelligence
 t The client‚Äôs motivation
 t The client‚Äôs general health
 t Care and stimulation provided by caregivers (For example, caregivers may provide 
speech and language stimulation in the home, learn sign language, learn how to ‚Äútrou-
bleshoot‚Äù hearing aid problems, or include the client in family activities.)
Figure 16-2 shows phonemes plotted on an audiogram according to frequency and loudness 
during normal conversational speech. Because of the shape of the speech zone, this is often re-
ferred to as the speech banana. Speech-language pathologists sometimes use the speech banana 
TABLE 16-2 
Effects of Hearing Loss on Communication and Types  
of Habilitative Intervention with Children
Minimal hearing loss  
 (16- to 25-dB HL)
At 15 dB a student can miss up to 10% of the speech signal  
  when a teacher is at a distance greater than 3 feet and 
when the classroom is noisy.
Mild hearing loss  
 (26- to 40-dB HL)
With a 30-dB loss, a student can miss 25‚Äì40% of a speech  
  signal. Without amplification, the child with 35-to 40-dB 
loss may miss at least 50% of class discussion.
Moderate hearing loss  
 (41- to 55-dB HL)
Child understands conversational speech at a distance of  
  3 to 5 feet (face to face) only if structure and vocabulary 
are controlled. Without amplification, the amount of 
speech signal missed can be 50‚Äì75% with a 40-dB loss, 
and 80‚Äì100% with a 50-dB loss.
Moderate to severe hearing loss  
 (56- to 70-dB HL)
Without amplification, conversation must be very loud to be  
  understood. A 55-dB loss can cause a child to miss up to 
100% of speech information.
Severe hearing loss  
 (71- to 90-dB HL)
Without amplification, the child may hear loud voices about  
  1 foot from the ear. When amplified optimally, children with 
hearing ability of 90 dB or better should be able to identify 
environmental sounds and detect all the sounds of speech.
Profound hearing loss  
 (>90-dB HL)
Aware of vibrations more than tonal patterns. May rely  
  on vision rather than hearing as the primary avenue for 
communication and learning.
Unilateral hearing loss (normal  
  hearing in one ear with the 
other ear exhibiting at least a 
mild permanent loss)
May have difficulty hearing faint or distant speech. Usually  
  has difficulty localizing sounds and has greater difficulty 
understanding speech in background noise.

when counseling clients or caregivers on the effects of hearing loss on speech and language 
development. A client‚Äôs audiological findings can also be superimposed over the speech banana 
audiogram to show which phonemes the individual may and may not be able to perceive.
SCREENING
Speech-language pathologists often provide a hearing screening as part of the complete 
diagnostic evaluation to identify a potential peripheral hearing loss that may affect a client‚Äôs 
communicative development or abilities. When a client fails a screen, he or she should be 
referred to an audiologist for further evaluation.
Screens are typically administered at 20 or 25 dB for the frequencies 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 
and 4000 Hz. For some clients, particularly children, it is common to use more conservative 
criteria‚Äî15 dB at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 8000 Hz‚Äîto reduce the risk 
of missing someone with a mild hearing loss. Form 16-1, the ‚ÄúHearing Screening Form,‚Äù is 
useful for recording findings.
INTERPRETING AUDIOGRAMS AND TYMPANOGRAMS
The audiologist is responsible for the complete evaluation and diagnosis of hearing impair-
ment. However, the speech-language pathologist needs to understand hearing, how it is 
tested, how to interpret assessment results, and how the results apply to individual clients. 
The reference materials in this section are designed to help the speech-language pathologist 
more thoroughly understand a client‚Äôs hearing impairment and its impact on the communi-
cative disorder, diagnosis, treatment program, and referral process.
Audiograms are used to record the results of audiological testing. The symbols used on 
an audiogram are listed in Table 16-3. These symbols may be presented in differentiating

Audiograms
The audiograms in Figures 16-3 through 16-9 illustrate several basic patterns of hearing 
loss. Exact configurations vary across individuals and according to the type, frequencies, and 
decibel levels of the loss. The hearing losses in these examples are bilateral (involving both 
ears), although unilateral hearing losses are also common.

Tympanograms
The purpose of tympanometry is to determine the point and magnitude of greatest compli-
ance (mobility) of the tympanic membrane. A tympanogram is a graph that illustrates the 
compliance on the y-axis (left-hand side) and pressure (in mm H2O) on the x-axis (across 
the bottom). The results provide important information about middle ear function and help 
diagnosticians detect different conditions and diseases of the middle ear. Tympanograms can 
be interpreted according to the peak pressure point, peak amplitude, and shape. Based on 
dimensions of the tympanogram, several classifications and possible etiologies are:
Pressure (shown by location of peak)
 t Normal peak: Otosclerosis, ossicular chain discontinuity, tympanosclerosis, cho-
lesteatoma in the attic space
 t No peak/flat: Perforated tympanic membrane
Compliance (shown by height of peak)
 t Increased amplitude: Eardrum abnormality, ossicular chain discontinuity
 t Reduced amplitude: Otosclerosis, tympanosclerosis, tumors, serous otitis media
 t Normal amplitude: Eustachian tube blockage, early acute otitis media
Shape (shown by slope)
 t Reduced slope: Otosclerosis, ossicular chain fixation, otitis media with effusion, tumor
 t Increased slope: Eardrum abnormality, ossicular chain discontinuity
 t Not smooth: Vascular tumors, patulous eustachian tube, ossicular chain discontinuity, 
eardrum abnormality
Figures 16-10 through 16-14 illustrate the five common patterns of tympanograms that 
clinicians encounter.

CHAPTER 16 Hearing Considerations
HEARING 
CONSIDERATIONS
SPEECH AUDIOMETRY
Speech audiometry evaluates a client‚Äôs ability to hear and understand speech. It can also be 
useful for assessing the effects of amplification. Two important speech audiometric findings 
are Speech Reception Threshold (SRT) and Speech Recognition scores. An SRT indicates the 
lowest decibel level at which a client can correctly identify a standard list of two-syllable 
words (called spondees) 50% of the time. Cupcake, baseball, and hotdog are examples of spondee 
words. A normal SRT is within plus or minus 6 dB from the pure tone average (average of 
pure tone thresholds at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz).
The speech recognition score reveals the client‚Äôs ability to recognize words. The test is 
administered at a comfortable decibel level above the SRT. The client is asked to select the 
correct word from similar-sounding pairs (cat-bat, beach-peach, etc.), or to repeat back single 
words (day, cap, etc.). A normal score is 90‚Äì100% correct.
ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE LEVELS
Table 16-4 lists several environmental noises that occur at different decibel levels. This in-
formation is useful for counseling clients or their caregivers about hearing loss and its effect 
on communication.

HEARING AIDS
There are three basic styles of hearing aids:
1. In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids fit completely inside the outer ear. They are commonly 
recommended for mild to severe hearing loss, and are worn primarily by adults. Some 
include a telecoil (T) that allows the user to receive sound through the circuitry of the 
hearing aid instead of the microphone.
2. Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids are worn behind the ear and connect to a plastic 
earmold that is worn inside the outer ear. They are used for mild to profound hearing 
loss. Although they are appropriate for individuals of any age, children most com-
monly use them; this is because the earmolds need to be replaced regularly to accom-
modate the changing shape of the child‚Äôs outer ear.

CHAPTER 16 Hearing Considerations
HEARING 
CONSIDERATIONS
3. Canal hearing aids are very small and fit tightly in the ear canal. In-the-canal (ITC) 
aids are made to fit the size and shape of the user‚Äôs ear canal. Completely-in-canal 
(CIC) aids fit deeper in the canal and are almost completely hidden in the ear canal. 
They are recommended for mild to moderately severe hearing loss and are worn pri-
marily by adults.
Before beginning a diagnostic evaluation of a client with a hearing impairment, do a 
quick listening check of his or her hearing aid(s). This is important! Imagine making a diag-
nosis of moderate articulation disorder or mild receptive language impairment only to discover 
that the client‚Äôs malfunctioning hearing aid was impeding his or her typical communication. 
Do not allow a broken hearing aid to skew diagnostic conclusions and recommendations. 
Complete a quick listening check by following these six steps. Attach the aid to a stetho-
scope or your own earmold for Steps 2 through 5.
1. Check the battery. Is it missing? Is it weak?
2. Alternate the on-off switch. Do you hear distortions? Crackling noises? Other un-
usual sounds? No sound at all?
3. Turn the hearing aid to low volume and gradually increase to maximum volume. Is the 
transition smooth? Distorted?
4. Produce the sounds /a/, /i/, /u/, /‚à´/, and /s/. Are they audible? Clear?
5. Tap on the case. Do you hear changes in the sound?
6. Check for feedback. Is there a crack somewhere?
Troubleshooting Hearing Aid Problems
Depending on the work setting, the clinician may see clients who are having trouble with 
their hearing aids. In some cases, the problem will have to be addressed by a trained hearing 
aid specialist (i.e., audiologist, hearing aid dispenser, hearing aid manufacturer). In other 
cases, you will be able to identify the problem and possibly correct it. For example, a client 
may report that the hearing aid is not amplifying anything. On inspection, you may discover 
that the tubing is twisted, the battery is dead, or the T (telecoil) switch is on. These problems 
are easily resolved on the spot by untwisting the tubing, replacing the battery, or turning the 
T switch off. If unable to resolve the problem, refer the client to the hearing aid dispenser 
or manufacturer if the aid is broken, or to a physician if the trouble is caused by impacted 
ear wax.
Table 16-5 is a troubleshooting guide for basic hearing aid problems. Refer to this table 
when encountering a client with hearing aid trouble.
VIBROTACTILE AIDS
Vibrotactile aids are sometimes used by clients with profound hearing losses. Essentially, the 
vibration of sound is felt through the skin. These vibratory aids are worn on the hand, wrist, 
stomach, back, arm, or thigh. Depending on the hearing loss, vibrotactile aids may be used 
together with more traditional amplification or used alone. One primary benefit of vibrotac-
tile stimulation is its capacity to increase speech-reading abilities.

COCHLEAR IMPLANTS
Cochlear implants may be an appropriate alternative to conventional amplification for some 
clients. Candidates include children and adults with severe hard of hearing or profound deaf-
ness. The implant bypasses damaged portions of the ear and directly stimulates the auditory 
nerve, which the brain interprets as sound. The implant consists of an external unit that sits 
behind the ear and an internal unit that is surgically placed under the skin. The external unit 
has a microphone that collects sound and a speech processor that arranges the sound picked 
up by the microphone. The signal is then received by the internal transmitter/stimulator and 
converted to electrical impulses that are sent to different parts of the auditory nerve.
A cochlear implant does not restore normal hearing. Adults receiving implants after loss 
of functional hearing must relearn how to interpret sounds. Children receiving implants 
must also participate in a post-implantation therapy program to help them acquire speech 
and language skills. The benefits people receive from cochlear implantation vary and are 
dependent upon several factors. These include:
 t The length of time the person was deaf or severely hearing impaired
 t The extent of the person‚Äôs prior hearing experience
 t The number of functioning auditory nerve fibers present
 t The motivation of the user, and the user‚Äôs parents if a child
 t The availability of auditory skills development programs to assist in hearing training 
or retraining
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Hearing is an extremely important factor in the development and maintenance of com-
municative abilities. A hearing loss can contribute to or even be the single cause of many 
communicative disorders. The audiologist is responsible for evaluating and diagnosing hear-

T
here are hundreds of medical diagnoses that can impact a client‚Äôs communicative abil-
ities. This chapter provides a brief description of many of the most common diseases, 
conditions, and syndromes, and highlights their clinical significance. Keep in mind that most 
illnesses or conditions have potential implications for the development of a speech-language 
disorder. For example, a person prone to frequent illness, whether or not each incident is long 
lasting or serious, is also more prone to a communicative disorder. This is especially true for 
children who have had multiple hearing losses due to otitis media during the crucial period 
of speech-language acquisition, or those who have frequently missed school due to illness 
and now lag behind their peers in communicative, social, and educational development.
A disease condition acquired by a pregnant woman may also influence the normal growth 
of her unborn child. Specific disruptions in fetal development are related to the time during 
gestation that the illness was acquired. First trimester illnesses impose the greatest devel-
opmental risks on the growing baby. Many congenital disorders have associated speech and 
language impairments.
DISEASES AND CONDITIONS
Adenoidectomy
An adenoidectomy is a partial or complete surgical removal of the adenoid tissue. This pro-
cedure is usually performed when a child‚Äôs adenoids enlarge and block the nasopharynx or 
eustachian tubes. The blockage often results in breathing difficulties or frequent bouts of 
otitis media.
Clinical Significance
 t The child may have experienced a prolonged period of hearing loss due to otitis me-
dia prior to the adenoidectomy.
 t Velopharyngeal incompetence resulting in hypernasality may occur in rare cases.
Allergies
Allergies are physical hypersensitivities to substances that are eaten, inhaled, injected, or 
brought into contact with the skin. Symptoms of an allergy attack often include headache, 
shock, excessive mucus production, constriction of bronchioles, and skin conditions such as 
redness, swelling, and itching.
Clinical Significance
 t Fluid buildup in the middle ear can occur, possibly resulting in hearing loss and asso-
ciated speech and language difficulties.
Asthma
Asthma is characterized by periodic attacks of wheezing, tightness in the chest, and breath-
ing difficulties. It can be triggered by allergies, emotional stress, infection, drug use, inhala-
tion of irritants, vigorous exercise, or a psychosomatic disorder. Asthma is relatively common 
among school-age children, and there is a tendency to outgrow the condition over time. 
Asthma can usually be kept under control with medical assistance.

MEDICAL  
DIAGNOSES
CHAPTER 17 Medical Diagnoses Associated with Communicative Disorders 
Clinical Significance
 t Successive and severe attacks can result in reduced oxygen supply to the body and 
permanent disability.
Cerebrovascular Accident
See Stroke.
Chickenpox (Varicella)
Chickenpox is a mild, infectious disease caused by a herpes virus. The primary symptom is 
a rash that appears mostly on the skin and the lining of the mouth and throat. Chickenpox 
primarily affects children between the ages of 5 and 9. It is less common in adolescents and 
adults. In children, recovery is usually fast (7 to 10 days); adolescents and adults are more 
prone to complications and a slower recovery period. Immunization is available for individ-
uals over the age of 12 months.
Clinical Significance
 t Chickenpox is usually a mild illness. However, in rare cases, it is associated with severe 
complications, such as Reye‚Äôs syndrome, pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death.
 t If the chickenpox eruptions occur in the ears, there may be a toxic effect that results 
in bilateral hearing loss.
Colds
The common cold is usually caused by a viral infection of the nose and throat, although 
the larynx and lungs may also be involved. Symptoms include nasal congestion, runny 
nose, sneezing, mild sore throat, watery eyes, hoarseness, abdominal pain, and coughing. 
A temporary conductive hearing loss may also be present. Colds usually occur in win-
ter months, and children are most prone to acquiring them. Immunity to cold viruses 
increases as a child grows older; therefore, the frequency of infection and severity are 
reduced over time.
Clinical Significance
 t Colds are not serious in most cases, although infections can spread to the middle ears, 
sinuses, larynx, trachea, or lungs. This can result in secondary bacterial infections with 
complications such as laryngitis, bronchitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.
Convulsions
See Seizures.
Croup
Croup is a viral disorder characterized by a barking-like cough, hoarseness, respiratory dis-
tress, and inhalatory stridor resulting from swelling of the larynx and trachea. In most cases, 
it is a complication of influenza or a cold. It can also be caused by an allergic reaction.

PART IV Additional Resources
Croup is a childhood disorder, primarily affecting children between the ages of 3 months 
and 3¬†years (although it can affect children up to 7 years of age). Attacks usually occur at 
night and subside after a few hours, and the condition may continue for several days. It is 
most common in the fall and winter months.
Clinical Significance
 t Severe croup is an indication of epiglottitis, which can be fatal.
 t In rare cases, there may be reduced oxygen supply to the body and permanent disabil-
ity. An emergency tracheostomy may be necessary.
Dizziness
Dizziness is a sensation of spinning, either within the person or in the person‚Äôs environment. 
It is a symptom of several types of neurological or aural disturbances. The person with dizzi-
ness may also feel nauseated, vomit, and have reduced control of balance. Dizziness can occur 
as a result of a severe blow to the head. It may also be an indication of a stroke, transient 
ischemic attack, subdural hemorrhage or hematoma, or brain tumor.
The term vertigo is often used interchangeably with dizziness, but they are not the same. 
Vertigo is dizziness experienced secondary to a middle ear pathology such as M√©ni√®re‚Äôs dis-
ease, otitis media, labyrinthitis, or ototoxicity.
Clinical Significance
 t A middle ear pathology may be present.
 t Because dizziness is associated with balance problems, a person could fall down and 
suffer a head injury, although this is rare.
Draining Ear
Draining ear is not a disease condition, but is a common symptom of certain disorders. A 
greenish- yellow discharge from the ear canal may be an indication of otitis externa, otitis media, 
or mastoiditis. The infected person may also experience pain in the ear during head movement.
Clinical Significance
 t Complications associated with draining ear must be evaluated according to the  
etiology of the condition.
 t When the drainage obstructs the outer ear canal, a temporary hearing loss may occur.
Encephalitis
Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain cells. Symptoms of mild encephalitis are similar 
to those of most viral infections, including fever, headache, and a loss of energy and appetite. 
Other symptoms and complications include irritability, restlessness, drowsiness (which may 
deepen into a coma in severe cases), loss of muscular power in the arms or legs, double vision, 
brain dysfunction, and impairment of speech and hearing. Babies and the elderly are at the 
highest risk for such complications.

DIAGNOSES
CHAPTER 17 Medical Diagnoses Associated with Communicative Disorders 
Clinical Significance
 t In severe cases, permanent brain damage can occur.
 t Speech and language impairments may result.
 t Recovery from a severe episode of encephalitis may be very slow, requiring long-term 
rehabilitation.
Flu
See Influenza.
German Measles (Rubella)
German measles is a contagious viral disease that is similar to, but milder than, common 
measles. It is characterized by a rash of small, flat, reddish-pink spots that appear on the 
face and neck and spread to the trunk and limbs. German measles is most common among 
children. Immunization is available for children over the age of 12 months.
Clinical Significance
Developing fetuses of pregnant women who have contracted the disease or received a vac-
cine within the three months preceding conception are at great risk for serious birth defects. 
These defects include:
 t Malformations, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, and meningoencephalitis
 t Heart defects and vision defects
 t Mental retardation
 t Deafness
 t Behavior problems such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, poor attention span, and sleep 
disturbances
 t Delayed speech and language development
Headaches
Headaches occur because of increased strain on muscles of the face, neck, and scalp (called 
tension headaches), or because of increased swelling of the blood vessels in the head (called 
vascular headaches). The resulting pain is located in the meninges, not the brain tissues. 
Many factors can lead to headaches, including stress, alcohol consumption, overeating, ex-
posure to noise, eyestrain, poor body posture, and head injury. They can also be a symptom 
of another medical condition, such as a viral infection or a hemorrhage. Common head-
aches should be differentiated from migraine headaches, which are much more intense and 
incapacitating.
Clinical Significance
 t A headache may be a symptom of more serious medical conditions, such as a central 
nervous system disorder or a hemorrhage.

High Fever
A high fever is a rise in body temperature above 100¬∞F (37.8¬∞C). It is usually a symptom of 
an infection. Other causes include severe trauma, reaction to medication or immunization, 
and certain types of cancer. In young children, a high fever can lead to febrile seizures. If the 
fever is very high, up to 107¬∞F (41.6¬∞C), permanent brain damage can result.
Clinical Significance
 t Clinical is usually dependent upon the etiology of the high fever.
 t In rare cases, hearing loss can occur if a high fever generates damaging toxins.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
See Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) under Syndromes later in this chapter.
Influenza (Flu)
Influenza is a viral disease that is characterized by chills, high fever, muscular pains, head-
ache, sore throat, and sneezing. A dry, hacking cough, possible chest pains, and runny nose 
follow these symptoms. Complete recovery typically occurs within 1 to 2 weeks. The disease 
is highly contagious and usually occurs in epidemics, especially in the winter and spring 
months. Complications include bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, otitis me-
dia, febrile seizures, skin rash, Reye‚Äôs syndrome, and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. Infants, the 
elderly, and people with suppressed immune systems or certain chronic diseases are most 
susceptible to complications.
Clinical Significance
 t Conditions that occur as complications of influenza may be associated with speech 
and language difficulties.
Mastoiditis
Mastoiditis is an inflammation of all or part of the mastoid process. It occurs most com-
monly when a middle ear infection spreads to the mastoid. Symptoms include intense pain 
behind the ear, fever, a rapid pulse rate, discharge from the affected ear, swelling behind the 
affected ear, and a pronounced hearing loss. A mastoidectomy (partial or complete removal 
of the mastoid) may be necessary in severe cases.
Clinical Significance
 t Speech and language difficulties associated with hearing loss may be present.
Measles (Rubeola)
Measles is a viral disease that primarily affects the skin and respiratory tract. Symptoms in-
clude nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, fever, and a characteristic rash. Measles is a highly 
contagious and potentially dangerous disease. Complications include hearing loss, otitis me-
dia, bronchitis, pneumonia, learning disabilities, encephalitis, meningitis, permanent brain 
damage, mental retardation, vision problems, seizures, and death. A pregnant woman who

contracts measles is at risk for premature labor or spontaneous abortion. Her newborn baby 
may have a low birth weight and, if the disease was contracted during the first trimester of 
fetal development, congenital malformation.
Measles often occurs in epidemics, but because immunization is available for children 
over 12 months old, it is not common. It should not be confused with German measles  
(rubella), which is much less serious, except during pregnancy.
Clinical Significance
 t Speech and language difficulties associated with hearing loss may be present.
 t The client may exhibit learning disabilities.
 t Neurological problems may be present.
M√©ni√®re‚Äôs Disease
M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease is a condition of the middle ear. Characteristic symptoms of M√©ni√®re‚Äôs 
disease include tinnitis, rotational vertigo, a feeling of fullness in the middle ear, and sen-
sorineural hearing loss. These symptoms are episodic, progressive, and fluctuate in intensity 
and frequency. The disease usually begins as a unilateral condition but it eventually becomes 
bilateral.
Clinical Significance
 t Complete deafness in one or both ears can occur.
 t In severe cases of vertigo, a person could fall and suffer a head injury.
Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges (the membranous coverings of the brain and 
spinal cord). Bacteria or viruses can spread to these membranes through the bloodstream or 
cavities and bones of the skull, or from a skull fracture. Symptoms include fever, headache, 
chills, nausea, vomiting, irritability, a stiff neck, confusion, and photophobia (inability to tol-
erate bright light). A deep red or purplish skin rash occurs in some cases.
The viral form of meningitis usually imposes no associated complications. Meningitis 
stemming from a bacterial infection, however, is a very serious condition requiring aggressive 
medical treatment. Complications associated with bacterial meningitis include convulsions, 
coma, permanent deafness, permanent blindness, mental deterioration, or death. Babies and 
the elderly are especially prone to these complications.
Clinical Significance
 t Brain damage can occur in severe cases.
 t Speech and language problems associated with hearing loss or neurological problems 
may be present.
Mumps
Mumps is a contagious viral infection of the salivary glands, particularly of the parotid 
glands located just anterior to the ears. The infected person may experience difficulty open-
ing the mouth, dryness of the mouth, pain during swallowing, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and

general feelings of illness. Once the mumps virus has entered the body, it can pass through 
the bloodstream to many different glands and to the brain. Mumps can occur at any age, but 
it is most common in children between the ages of 5 and 15. Immunization is available for 
children over the age of 12 months.
Clinical Significance
 t Meningitis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, febrile seizures, respiratory tract infections, or 
ear infections can occur as a complication.
 t A mild to severe hearing loss can occur. The hearing loss is typically (but not exclu-
sively) unilateral.
Otitis Media
Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear. The infection may be viral or bacterial, and 
it usually spreads from the nose and throat to the ear through the eustachian tube. The in-
fection can also enter the middle ear through a ruptured eardrum. The symptoms of acute 
otitis media include a feeling of fullness in the affected ear that is followed by pain, fever, 
and hearing loss. If untreated, the acute condition may lead to chronic otitis media, which is 
much more serious and permanently damaging. Otitis media is very common among chil-
dren, particularly those under 6 years of age.
Clinical Significance
 t Otitis media is nearly always associated with a temporary hearing loss. This can di-
rectly influence speech and language development because repeated infections are 
common among children during the critical years of speech and language acquisition.
 t Middle ear pressure from pus buildup may cause the eardrum to burst.
 t Permanent hearing impairment can occur in chronic cases.
Parkinson‚Äôs Disease
Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a degenerative condition caused by gradual deterioration of nerve cen-
ters in the brain. This deterioration disrupts the brain‚Äôs normal balance of dopamine and 
acetylcholine, resulting in progressive loss of control of movement. One of the first symp-
toms of Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a rhythmic tremor of the hands and head, often accompanied 
by involuntary rubbing together of the thumb and forefinger. As the condition progresses, 
automatic physical movements associated with walking, writing, and speaking also become 
impaired. Other symptoms include excessive salivation, abdominal cramps, and, in the latest 
stages of the disease, deterioration of memory and thought processes. It most often affects 
people who are late middle age and older. Parkinson‚Äôs disease is sometimes medically con-
trolled with carbidopa/levodopa which can significantly reduce the severity of the condition.
Clinical Significance
 t Parkinson‚Äôs disease can result in mild to profound communication and swallowing 
impairments, depending on the individual and the stage of progression of the disease.
 t Dysphagia and hypokinetic dysarthria are characteristic.
 t As deterioration increases, cognitive function may be impaired.

MEDICAL  
DIAGNOSES
CHAPTER 17 Medical Diagnoses Associated with Communicative Disorders 
Pneumonia (Pneumonitis)
Pneumonia is a general term for inflammation of the lungs. The several types of pneumonia 
are differentiated by their origins and severity. Most cases are viral or bacterial in origin al-
though fungi; inhalation of food, vomit, or pus; or inhalation of poisonous gas can also cause 
pneumonia. Symptoms vary according to the type of pneumonia. Symptoms include nasal 
congestion, cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath, bluish skin, chest pain, sweating, blood 
in the phlegm, or possible mental confusion. Severity varies considerably from mild and 
uncomplicated to extremely dangerous and life threatening.
Clinical Significance
 t Pneumonia, particularly aspiration type, may indicate dysphagia.
Rubella
See German Measles (Rubella).
Rubeola
See Measles (Rubeola).
Seizures
Seizures, also called convulsions, are uncontrollable muscle contractions caused by  abnormal 
electrical activity in the brain. They vary considerably in severity. During a generalized 
 tonicoclonic seizure, also called a grand mal seizure, the person loses consciousness and exhibits 
jerking movements of the whole body. The seizure may last only seconds or several minutes 
before the person regains consciousness and then often falls into a deep sleep. Most febrile 
convulsions (those associated with a fever) are of this type.
Absence seizures, also called petit mal seizures, are much less severe. The person may exhibit 
a blank stare and appear to be daydreaming for several seconds. After the seizure is over, he 
or she does not remember that it happened. This type of seizure can occur many times in 
one day.
A psychomotor seizure, also called a temporal lobe attack, occurs when a person exhibits 
violent behavior, laughs, or cries for no apparent reason. The seizure lasts for a few minutes. 
Afterward, he or she is not aware that it occurred.
Infantile spasms are sudden episodes in which a baby or toddler drops his or her head to 
his or her chest and doubles up at the waist. Afterward the child may fall asleep. These con-
vulsions last only a second to a few seconds and can occur several times a day.
Seizures occur most often in children and are often outgrown by adulthood. People 
prone to seizures usually have idiopathic epilepsy or a minor fever-causing infection. Other 
causes include meningitis, encephalitis, hypoglycemia, brain damage, cerebral palsy, or a 
brain tumor.
Clinical Significance
 t A head injury can occur during a seizure, although this is rare.
 t Neurological problems related to speech, language, and swallowing may be present.

PART IV Additional Resources
Sinusitis
Sinusitis is an inflammation or infection of the sinuses (the moist air spaces behind the 
bones of the upper face). Symptoms include coughing, a greenish discharge through the 
nose, increased nasal congestion, fever, and a general feeling of illness. Facial pain may also 
be present in the area(s) of the inflamed sinus or sinuses. Sinusitis is common. Some people 
have repeated attacks nearly every time they have a cold. The condition can also be acquired 
through damage to the nasal bones, nasal obstruction by a foreign object, or a nasal deformity.
Clinical Significance
 t Untreated sinusitis can spread to the bones or into the brain.
Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident)
A cerebrovascular accident (CVA), commonly known as a stroke, occurs when part of the 
brain is damaged because its blood supply is disrupted. There are three etiologies of a stroke. 
A cerebral hemorrhage occurs when an artery bursts or leaks and blood seeps into the brain 
tissue. A cerebral thrombosis occurs when a clot forms in an artery and eventually grows until 
it partially or completely blocks the flow of blood at that point. A cerebral embolism occurs 
when foreign material is carried through the bloodstream and becomes caught, obstructing 
the flow of blood to the brain. The result of a stroke is dependent on the area of the brain 
affected and the severity of the damage. Symptoms of a stroke include headache, blurred or 
double vision, confusion, dizziness, slurred speech or an inability to talk, weakness or numb-
ness on only one side of the body, difficulty swallowing, and loss of consciousness. These 
symptoms persist for a period of at least 24 hours and usually significantly longer (unlike a 
transient ischemic attack).
Clinical Significance
 t Depending on the severity of the stroke, the consequent deficits can be mild to pro-
found. Speech, language, swallowing, and cognition can be affected, resulting in dys-
arthria, aphasia, apraxia, dysphagia, or cognitive-linguistic impairments.
Tinnitus
Tinnitus is an unwanted noise in the ear that varies in quality and pitch among people with 
the condition. Various descriptions of tinnitus have included a buzzing sound, a highpitched 
whistle, a grinding noise, or a low-pitched roar. Some people experience the condition contin-
uously, while others report intermittent attacks of tinnitus. Tinnitus is usually associated with 
ear problems such as earwax buildup, M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease, age-related hearing loss, trauma from 
loud noises, or trauma from a sudden change in barometric pressure. Stress, a virus, diet, thy-
roid problems, hypertension, head trauma, drug intake, and dental problems can also trigger it.
Clinical Significance
 t Tinnitus can be an early symptom of progressive hearing loss, meningitis, encephali-
tis, ototoxicity (loss of hearing from medications), or an acoustic neuronoma (a tumor 
in the ear).

MEDICAL  
DIAGNOSES
CHAPTER 17 Medical Diagnoses Associated with Communicative Disorders 
Tonsillitis
Tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Symp-
toms include sore throat, pain when swallowing, headache, chills, fever, swollen glands on 
the neck, and red, inflamed tonsils. Some children experience febrile convulsions. The dis-
ease is common among children, especially those between 2 and 6 years of age. Tonsillitis 
is highly infectious and is often accompanied by an infection of the adenoids, otitis media, 
and sinusitis. If the condition occurs frequently or is especially severe, a tonsillectomy may 
be recommended.
Clinical Significance
 t Frequent bouts of tonsillitis may be associated with intermittent hearing loss.
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs when there is an interference of normal blood 
flow to the brain. Typically, a foreign material flowing through the bloodstream becomes 
caught and disrupts the brain‚Äôs blood supply, much like a cerebral embolism (see Stroke). 
The symptoms are very similar to a stroke and include headache, dizziness, blurred or dou-
ble vision, confusion, slurred speech, swallowing difficulty, and weakness or numbness on 
one side of the body. These symptoms, however, are short lived (less than 24 hours) because 
the foreign material is eventually dislodged or broken up and blood circulation to the brain 
is restored.
Clinical Significance
 t A TIA is usually not complicated because the resulting impairments are temporary, 
although it is often a warning of an impending stroke.
SYNDROMES
A syndrome is a distinct collection of symptoms that together are characteristic of a specific 
disease or disorder. The etiology may be viral, bacterial, genetic, chromosomal, teratogenic 
(a foreign agent causing embryonic or fetal structural abnormalities), or traumatic. Many 
syndromes have been named and described, yet many more remain unidentified by medical 
experts. Some of the major syndromes that affect communicative abilities, and therefore may 
be seen by clinicians for speech, language, or hearing services, are described in this section. 
Use caution when using this information and consider these factors:
1. Syndrome severity varies tremendously. A child diagnosed with a given syndrome may 
exhibit barely detectable symptoms or may be a ‚Äútextbook example.‚Äù
2. Individual symptoms vary. For example, a child with mental retardation may be se-
verely intellectually impaired or may have near normal intelligence.
3. All symptoms associated with a syndrome need not be present. Syndromes are a collection

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), in which infected particles enter the blood-
stream and replicate themselves to the point of outnumbering healthy cells, is caused by the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A person infected with HIV may appear healthy for 
several years or a lifetime before developing AIDS. The virus is transmitted through some 
infected bodily fluids. An unborn baby will acquire the virus if his or her mother is a carrier. 
AIDS symptoms include:
 t Impaired natural defense mechanism due to the depletion of healthy white  
blood cells
 t High risk for multiple infections (especially pneumonia, swollen lymph glands, fever, 
and encephalitis), cancer (particularly skin cancer), and neurological illnesses
 t In adults: fever, weight loss, swollen glands, general weakness, headaches, drowsiness, 
confusion, and infections of the mouth, skin, or chest
 t In children: low birth weight, developmental delay, upper respiratory infections, 
pneumonia, ear diseases, and sensorineural hearing loss. Children are prone to more 
severe infections than adults. Infected children are especially at risk for cancer of the 
external ear, cancer of the oral cavity, and cortical atrophy.
 t Dysphagia associated with generalized weakness
 t Language disorders associated with hearing loss
 t Articulation disorders associated with hearing loss
Alport‚Äôs Syndrome

Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Syndromes (Including Hurler, Scheie, 
Hunter, Sanfilippo, Morquio, Maroteaux-Lamy, and Sly Syndromes)
The mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) syndromes are a group of rare disorders (perhaps 100‚Äì700 
occurrences per year in the United States). Common characteristics include:
 t Excessive storage of complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharidoses) in the body 
 t Progressive physical and mental deterioration
 t Hearing loss
 t Thick hair and eyebrows
 t Speech, language, and hearing problems: these occur in all of the MPS disorders, but 
there is limited documentation about specific communication impairments associated 
with each syndrome.
The most common MPS syndromes are Hurler and Hunter syndromes. The differential 
diagnosis of Hunter syndrome is essential because it is a recessively inherited syndrome that 
carries a 25% chance of subsequent recurrence. Other MPS syndromes include Sanfilippo, 
Morquio, Maroteaux-Lamy, and Sly syndromes.
Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF-2)
Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF-2) is a genetic syndrome characterized by:

CONCLUDING COMMENTS
This chapter described many medical conditions, diseases, and syndromes that have a potential 
impact on speech-language development and function. The information provided here is sim-
pliÔ¨Åed and non-exhaustive. Further research is recommended, especially when working with 
a client diagnosed with a particular diagnosis. An accurate assessment for a speech-language 
disorder depends upon thorough knowledge of associated medical diagnoses.

SUGGESTIONS FOR INCREASING SPEECH AND LANGUAGE  
DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN
 t From birth, talk to your child a lot. Bath time, mealtime, and bedtime are perfect 
 opportunities to model language and build vocabulary. Talk about what you are doing, 
seeing, or thinking, or talk about what is going to happen. 
 t Provide a good language model. Speak clearly, maintain eye contact, and use natural 
intonation when talking to your child. 
 t Acknowledge and expand on what your child says. If he or she says,‚ÄùMilk,‚Äù reply with 
‚ÄúYou want milk? I will get milk for you. Here is your milk.‚Äù 
 t Give your child opportunities to communicate. Ask questions that require a choice, 
such as, ‚ÄúDo you want water or juice?‚Äù If your child points to something he or she 
wants, encourage speech by saying, ‚ÄúTell me what you want?‚Äù Pause after asking 
 questions or making comments to give your child an opportunity to talk. 
 t Imitate and reinforce sounds and words your child says. If a word is said incorrectly, 
never criticize. Repeat it back, modeling the correct pronunciation.
 t Sing children‚Äôs songs, especially repetitive songs such as The Wheels on the Bus 
and If You‚Äôre Happy and You Know It. Use hand and body motions to reinforce 
the¬†words.
 t Play with your child frequently. Name objects and colors, count, describe things, 
make animal sounds, and take turns. Play ‚Äúlet‚Äôs pretend‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of . . .‚Äù 
games.
 t Read to your child frequently. Name pictures in a book and talk about the story. 
Rhyming books are especially good for early literacy development. 
 t With older children, make up stories together with a setting, characters, a plot with a 
conflict, and a resolution.
 t Avoid screen time as a passive activity. Instead, watch or play together. Talk about 
what you are watching. Make predictions and talk about the characters. Play cognitive 
and language-building games together on devices such as iPads or tablets. Solo play 
does not build language and can hinder growth.
 t Follow your child‚Äôs lead. For example, if he or she likes animals, read books about 
 animals; talk about what animals say, where they live, what they eat, what they look 
like, etc.; visit a zoo together.
 t Consult a speech-language pathologist if you are concerned about your child‚Äôs 
 communicative development.

READING AND WRITING DEVELOPMENT
The following information presents the normal sequence of development for reading and 
writing. 
Birth‚Äì2 Years
Reading
 t From birth, a child is exposed to print (e.g., on household items, billboards,  
books, etc.).
 t Child accumulates knowledge about letters, words, and books.
3 Years
Reading
 t Metalinguistic knowledge develops (i.e., knowledge that language consists of discrete 
phonemes, words, phrases, and sentences).
 t Phonological awareness develops, (i.e., awareness that words are made up of sound 
segments).
 t Knowledge of the alphabetic principle begins (i.e., letters in English represent speech 
sounds).
 t Child recognizes words that rhyme (e.g., hat, rat) and words that begin with the same 
sound (e.g., big ball).
 t Print awareness develops; child understands that print has meaning and structure 
(e.g., moves from left to right, top to bottom; words are separated by space). Child 
recognizes trademark logos (e.g., McDonald‚Äôs¬Æ) and the child‚Äôs own name.
Writing
 t Child scribbles, but with no discernable letters.
 t Some scribble shows basic knowledge of conventional rules of writing; scribble may 
occur in lines, may flow from left to right and top to bottom, and may show some 
conventional spacing.
4 Years
Reading
 t Phonemic awareness develops (i.e., awareness that words are made up of specific units 
of sounds that have distinct features).
 t Child says words that rhyme (e.g., dog, frog) and words that begin with the same 
sound (e.g., cup, cap).
 t Child segments a sentence into separate words (e.g., The boy jumped is segmented to 
the-boy-jumped).
 t Child counts the number of syllables in words.

648
PART IV Additional Resources
Writing
 t Writing resembles standard letters and words.
 t Child must interpret his or her writing for others.
5 Years (Kindergarten)
Reading
 t Child knows when words do not rhyme (e.g., hog does not rhyme with hat).
 t Child recites and names letters of the alphabet and numbers 1‚Äì10.
 t Child identifies the first sound of a spoken word and separates it from the rime (the 
first vowel and any following vowels and consonants of a syllable) (e.g., dog begins 
with d).
 t Child blends the beginning sound with the remaining sounds of a word.
 t Child segments multisyllabic words into syllables (e.g., elephant is el-e-phant).
 t Child reads some familiar words by sight.
Writing

COMMUNICATION OPTIONS FOR LARYNGECTOMEES
This table describes the major advantages and disadvantages of the three primary commu-
nication options following laryngectomy.
Advantages and Disadvantages of the Three Primary Alaryngeal 
Communication Options
ARTIFICIAL LARYNX
Advantages:
Easy to use
Speech is generally intelligible
Suitable for use immediately after surgery in most cases
Can be an interim source of communication
Disadvantages: 
Mechanical, ‚Äúrobot-like‚Äù vocal quality
Draws attention to the speaker 
Requires good articulation skills
Requires the use of one hand
ESOPHAGEAL SPEECH
Advantages: 
Does not require reliance upon a mechanical device
Both hands are free while speaking
Vocal productions are the client‚Äôs ‚Äúown voice‚Äù
More natural sounding than electromechanical devices
Disadvantages: 
 
Difficult to learn (approximately one-third of laryngectomees are unable to learn 
esophageal speech)
Client may need to learn to habitually speak in shorter phrases
Vocal intensity is sometimes insufficient
Client may have a hoarse voice quality
Potential articulatory errors, excessive stoma noise, ‚Äúklunking,‚Äù and facial 
grimacing need to be overcome during the learning process
TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL SPEECH
Advantages: 
Most natural voice quality of all alaryngeal communication options
Greater pitch and intensity range than esophageal speech
Easier and faster to learn than esophageal speech
Clients can effectively produce sentences of normal length
Disadvantages: 
Requires additional surgery
Maintenance of the prosthesis is required
Manual occlusion of the stoma is required if a tracheostoma valve is not used
Some risk of aspiration of the prosthesis

IMPACT OF HEARING LOSS IN A CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT
Effects of Hearing Loss on Communication and Types of Habilitative 
Intervention with Children
Minimal hearing loss  
 (16- to 25-dB HL)
At 15 dB a student can miss up to 10% of the speech signal  
  when a teacher is at a distance greater than 3 feet and 
when the classroom is noisy.
Mild hearing loss  
 (26- to 40-dB HL)
With a 30-dB loss, a student can miss 25‚Äì40% of a speech  
  signal. Without amplification, the child with 35- to 40-dB 
loss may miss at least 50% of class discussion.
Moderate hearing loss  
 (41- to 55-dB HL)
Child understands conversational speech at a distance of  
  3 to 5 feet (face to face) only if structure and vocabulary 
are controlled. Without amplification, the amount of 
speech signal missed can be 50‚Äì75% with a 40-dB loss, 
and 80‚Äì100% with a 50-dB loss.
Moderate to severe hearing loss  
 (56- to 70-dB HL)
Without amplification, conversation must be very loud to be  
  understood. A 55-dB loss can cause a child to miss up to 
100% of speech information.
Severe hearing loss  
 (71- to 90-dB HL)
Without amplification, the child may hear loud voices about  
  1 foot from the ear. When amplified optimally, children with 
hearing ability of 90 dB or better should be able to identify 
environmental sounds and detect all the sounds of speech.
Profound hearing loss  
 (>90-dB HL)
Aware of vibrations more than tonal patterns. May rely  
  on vision rather than hearing as the primary avenue for 
communication and learning.
Unilateral hearing loss (normal  
  hearing in one ear with the 
other ear exhibiting at least a 
mild permanent loss)
May have difficulty hearing faint or distant speech. Usually  
  has difficulty localizing sounds and has greater difficulty 
understanding speech in background noise.

Assessment in Speech-Language Pathology
Atresia: Congenital absence, pathological closure, or severe underdevelopment of a normal 
orifice or cavity. As used in audiology, it often refers to an abnormally small or mal-
formed pinna (the visible outside part of the ear).
Atrophy: The wasting away of tissues or an organ due to disease or lack of use.
Audiogram: A graphic illustration of hearing sensitivity. An audiogram depicts hearing 
levels (in dB) at different frequencies (Hz) of sound.
Auricle: The outside visible part of the ear. Also called the pinna.
Autism: A serious disorder characterized by significant deficits in social communication and 
fixated interests and/or behaviors.
Automatic speech: Speech that is produced with little conscious effort or thought, such as 
counting from 1 to 10 or reciting the alphabet. Examples of automatic speech include 
saying ‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù after bumping against something, or responding to a greeting with 
‚ÄúFine, how are you?‚Äù without thinking about it.
Auxiliary verb: A verb used with a main verb to convey condition, voice, or mood; a ‚Äúhelping 
verb‚Äù be, do, or have, such as is going, did go, or have gone.
