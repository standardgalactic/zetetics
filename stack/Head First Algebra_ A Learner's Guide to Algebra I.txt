Advance Praise for Head First Algebra
“Head First Algebra is a clear, easy-to-understand method to learn a subject that many people find 
intimidating. Because of its somewhat irreverent attitude in presenting mathematical topics for beginners, 
this book inspires students to learn algebra at a depth they might have otherwise thought unachievable.”
— Ariana Anderson 
“The way this book presents information is so conversational and intriguing it helps in the learning 
process. It truly feels like you’re having a conversation with the author.”
— Amanda Borcky
“What do punk bands need to know about algebra? How will quadratics make your listening experiences 
better? Crack the spine on this to find out in a fun and engaging way!”
— Cary Collett
“This has got to be the best book out there for learning basic algebra. It’s genuinely entertaining.”
— Dawn Griffiths, author of “Head First Statistics”
“I wish I had a book like Head First Algebra when I was in high school. I love how the authors relate math 
concepts to real-life situations. Not only does it make learning Algebra easy, but also fun!”
— Karen Shaner
“Head First Algebra is an engaging read. The book does a fantastic job of explaining concepts and taking 
the reader step-by-step through solving problems. The problems were challenging and applicable to 
everyday life.”
— Shannon Stewart, Math Teacher
“The book is driven by excellent examples from the world in which students live. No trains leaving 
from the same station at the same time moving in opposite directions. The authors anticipate well the 
questions that arise in students’ minds and answer them in a timely manner. A very readable look at the 
topics encountered in Algebra 1.”
— Herbert Tracey, Instructor of Mathematical Sciences, Loyola University

Authors of Algebra
Dan Pilone is a Software Architect 
for Vangent, Inc. and has led software 
development teams for the Naval Research 
Laboratory and NASA. He’s taught graduate 
and undergraduate Software Engineering at 
Catholic University in Washington, D.C.
This is Dan’s second Head First Book, 
but it still comes with some firsts: his first 
book outside of Computer Science and 
his first book co-authored by his wife (who, 
incidentally, is much better looking than his 
last co-author. Sorry, Russ.) Working with 
Tracey on this book changed it from being 
work to being family fun time. Well, not 
entirely, but still an amazing experience.
Dan’s degree is in Computer Science with a 
minor in Mathematics. For anyone who needs 
inspiration that Algebra can be fun, fire up a 
good game of Halo and think about all the 
x’s, y’s, and z’s that make it all possible.
Tracey Pilone would first like to thank her 
co-author and husband for being unwavering 
in his support and open enough to share the 
Head First world with her.
She is a freelance technical writer who 
supported mission planning and RF analysis 
software for the Navy, right before she decided 
to write a math book.
She spent several years before becoming a 
writer working as a construction manager on 
large commercial construction sites around 
Washington DC. That’s where she actually 
used Algebra on a somewhat regular basis 
and saw first hand that math is what makes 
buildings stay up.
She has a Civil Engineering degree from 
Virginia Tech, holds a Professional Engineer’s 
License, and received a Masters of Education 
from the University of Virginia.

Your brain on Algebra.   Here you are trying to learn something, while 
here your brain is doing you a favor by making sure the learning doesn’t stick.  Your 
brain’s thinking, “Better leave room for more important things, like which wild 
animals to avoid and whether naked snowboarding is a bad idea.” So how do you 
trick your brain into thinking that your life depends on knowing Algebra?

Taking Algebra on the road
Imagine a world where there is more than ONE thing you 
don’t know. Not only are there problems with more than one unknown, but 
sometimes you’ve got one unknown that appears multiple times in the same 
equation! No worries, though... with the tools you’ll learn in this chapter, you’ll be 
solving more complicated expressions in no time at all.

Sometimes you just gotta follow the stinking rules. 
But when it comes to Algebra, rules are a good thing. They’ll keep you from 
getting the wrong answer. In fact, lots of times, rules will help you solve for an 
unknown without a lot of extra work. Leave your dunce cap behind for this chapter 
because we’ll be following a few handy rules all the way to a perfect score.
Podcasts that spread like the plague
Could you multiply that again... and again? 
There’s another way to express multiplication that’s repeated over and over and 
over again, without just repeating yourself. Exponents are a way of repeating 
multiplication. But there’s more to exponents, including some smaller-than-usual 
numbers (and we don’t just mean fractions). In this chapter, you’ll brush up on bases, 
roots, and radicals.

graphing
Sometimes an equation might be hiding things. 
Ever looked at an equation and thought, “But what the heck does that mean?” In times 
like that, you just might need a visual representation of your equation. That’s where 
graphs come in. They let you look at an equation, instead of just reading it. You can 
see where important points are on the graph, like when you’ll run out of money, or 
how long it will take you to save up for that new car. In fact, with graphs, you can make 
smart decisions with your equations.

Can’t quite get enough?
Sometimes enough is enough... and sometimes it’s not. 
Have you ever thought, “I just need a little bit more”? But what if someone gave 
you more than just a bit more? Then you’d have more than you need... but life 
might still be pretty good. In this chapter, you’ll see how Algebra lets you say, 
“Give me a little more... and then some!” With inequalities, you’ll go beyond 
two values and allow yourself to get more, or less.

You can graph equations with two unknowns, but can

lately: C and t, x, and y, and more. But what about actually solving equations with 
two variables? That’s going to take more than one equation. In fact, you need an 
equation for every unknown you’ve got. But what then? Well, a little substitution, 
a few lines, and an intersection are all you need to solve two-variable equations.

Breaking up is hard to do
Sometimes being square is enough to give you fits. So far, 
we’ve dealt with variables like x and y. But what happens when x is squared in 
your equations? It’s time to find out—and you already have the tools to solve these 
problems! Remember the distributive rule? In this chapter, you’re going to learn how to 
use distribution and a special technique called FOIL to solve a new kind of equation: 
binomials. Get ready—it’s time to break down some really tough equations.

quadratic equations
Not everything in life is linear. But just because an equation doesn’t 
graph as a straight line, doesn’t mean it’s unimportant. In fact, some of the most 
important unknowns you’ll have to work with in life end up being non-linear. 
Sometimes you’ve got to deal with terms that have exponents greater than 1. In 
fact, some equations with squared terms graph as curves! How’s that work? Well, 
there’s only one way to find out...

Everyone has limits
Some equations are like suburban neighborhoods... 
	
	
	
	
	
	
  ...they’re fenced in.  
You’ll find that in the real world, many equations are limited. There are only certain 
values that an equation is good for. For instance, you can’t drive a car -5 miles or dig 
a hole 13 feet up. In those cases, you need to set boundaries on your equations. And 
when it comes to putting some limits on your equations, there’s nothing better than a 
function. A function? What the heck is that? Well, turn the page, and find out... through 
the lens of reality TV.

Build on a solid foundation
Do you ever feel like you can’t even get started? 
Algebra is great, but if you want to learn it, you have to have a good understanding of 
number rules. Suppose you’re rolling along and realize that you forgot how to multiply 
integers, add fractions, or divide a decimal? Well, you’ve come to the right place! Here 
we’re going to cover all the pre-Algebra you need—fast.

the intro
“How can this be a serious Algebra book?”
“What’s with all the graphics?”
“Can I actually learn it this way?”
Your brain craves novelty. It’s always searching, scanning, waiting for something 
unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive. 
So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things you 
encounter? Everything it can to stop them from interfering with the brain’s 
real job—recording things that matter. It doesn’t bother saving the boring 
things; they never make it past the “this is obviously not important” filter.
How does your brain know what’s important? Suppose you’re out for a 
day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens inside your head 
and body? 
Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. 
And that’s how your brain knows...
This must be important! Don’t forget it!
But imagine you’re at home, or in a library. It’s a safe, warm, tiger‑free zone. 
You’re studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn some tough 
technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, ten days at the most.
Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s trying to 
make sure that this obviously non-important content doesn’t clutter up scarce 
resources. Resources that are better spent storing the really big things. Like 
tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like remembering where all of the 
warp zones are in Super Mario Brothers. And there’s no simple 
way to tell your brain, “Hey brain, thank you very much, but no 
matter how dull this book is, and how little I’m registering on the 
emotional Richter scale right now, I really do want you to keep this 
stuff around.”
We know what you’re thinking
We know what your brain is thinking
Your brain thinks 
THIS is important.
Your brain thinks 
THIS isn’t worth 
saving.
Great. Only 520 
more dull, dry,

how to use this book
We think of a “Head First” reader as a learner.
So what does it take to learn something? First, you have to get it, then make sure 
you don’t forget it.  It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the latest 
research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, learning 
takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.
Some of the Head First learning principles:
Make it visual. Images are far more memorable than words alone, and make learning 
much more effective (up to 89% improvement in recall and transfer studies). It also 
makes things more understandable.  Put the words within or 
near the graphics they relate to, rather than on the bottom 
o r 
on another page, and learners will be up to twice as likely to solve 
problems related to the content.
Use a conversational and personalized style. In recent studies, 
students performed up to 40% better on post-learning tests if the content 
spoke directly to the reader, using a first-person, conversational style rather 
than taking a formal tone. Tell stories instead of lecturing. Use casual language. 
Don’t take yourself too seriously. Which would you pay more attention to: a 
stimulating dinner party companion, or a lecture?
Get the learner to think more deeply. In other words, unless you actively flex your 
neurons, nothing much happens in your head.  A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and 
inspired to solve problems, draw conclusions, and generate new knowledge. And for that, you need 
challenges, exercises, and thought-provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides of the 
brain and multiple senses.
Get—and keep—the reader’s attention. We’ve all had the “I really want to learn 
this but I can’t stay awake past page one” experience. Your brain pays attention to 
things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. 
Learning a new, tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be boring. Your brain will 
learn much more quickly if it’s not.
Touch their emotions. We now know that 
your ability to remember something is largely 
dependent on its emotional content.  You remember what you care 
about.  You remember when you feel something. No, we’re not talking 
heart‑wrenching stories about a boy and his dog. We’re talking emotions 
like surprise, curiosity, fun, “what the...?” , and the feeling of “I Rule!” that 
comes when you solve a puzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is 
hard, or realize you know something that “I’m more technical than thou” 
Bob from engineering doesn’t.

the intro
Metacognition: thinking about thinking
I wonder how 
I can trick my brain 
into remembering 
this stuff...
If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more 
deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. 
Learn how you learn.
Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we 
were growing up. We were expected to learn, but rarely taught to learn.
But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you really want to master 
Algebra. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time. If you want to 
use what you read in this book, you need to remember what you read. And for 
that, you’ve got to understand it. To get the most from this book, or any book 
or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on this 
content. 
The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as 
Really Important. Crucial to your well‑being. As important as a tiger. 
Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to 
keep the new content from sticking.
So just how DO you get your brain to treat Algebra 
like it was a hungry tiger?
There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The 
slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you are able to learn 
and remember even the dullest of topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your 
brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t feel important to him, but he 
keeps looking at the same thing over and over and over, so I suppose it must be.”
The faster way is to do anything that increases brain activity, especially different 
types of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, 
and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For 
example, studies show that putting words within the pictures they describe (as opposed to 
somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to 
makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. 
More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to get that this is something worth 
paying attention to, and possibly recording.
A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they 
perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up 
their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily care that the “conversation” 
is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your 
brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful 
of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.
But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning…

xxiv    intro
how to use this book
Here’s what WE did:
We used pictures, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your 
brain’s concerned, a picture really is worth a thousand words. And when text and 
pictures work together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works 
more effectively when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a 
caption or buried in the text somewhere.
We used redundancy, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media 
types, and multiple senses, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more 
than one area of your brain. 
We used concepts and pictures in unexpected ways because your brain is tuned 
for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least some emotional content, 
because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. 
That which causes you to feel something is more likely to be remembered, even 
if that feeling is nothing more than a little humor, surprise, or interest.
We used a personalized, conversational style, because your brain is tuned to pay more 
attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively listening 
to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re reading.
We included more than 80 activities, because your brain is tuned to learn and 
remember more when you do things than when you read about things. And we made 
the exercises challenging-yet-do-able, because that’s what most people prefer.
We used multiple learning styles, because you might prefer step-by-step procedures, 
while someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and someone else just wants 
to see an example. But regardless of your own learning preference, everyone benefits from 
seeing the same content represented in multiple ways.
We include content for both sides of your brain, because the more of your brain you 
engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay 
focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a 
chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time. 
And we included stories and exercises that present more than one point of 
view, because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make 
evaluations and judgments. 
We included challenges, with exercises, and by asking questions that don’t always have 
a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to work at 
something. Think about it—you can’t get your body in shape just by watching people at the 
gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the right things. 
That you’re not spending one extra dendrite processing a hard-to-understand example, 
or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.
We used people. In stories, examples, pictures, etc., because, well, because you’re a person. 
And your brain pays more attention to people than it does to things.

the intro
So, we did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a 
starting point; listen to your brain and figure out what works 
for you and what doesn’t. Try new things.
6
Drink water. Lots of it.
Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. 
Dehydration (which can happen before you ever 
feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function. 
9
Use Algebra in the Real World.
There’s only one way to get comfortable with 
Algebra: do it a lot. Now, that doesn’t mean you 
need to lock yourself in a room with graph paper 
and pencils. But it does mean you should think 
about how Algebra fits in to the world around you. 
What problem are you trying to solve? What are 
the knowns and unknowns? How do they relate 
to each other? The point is that you won’t really 
get Algebra if you just read about it—you need 
to do it. We’re going to give you a lot of practice: 
every chapter is full of exercises and asks questions 
that you need to think about. Don’t just skip over 
them—most of the learning actually happens when 
you work on the exercises. Don’t be afraid to peek 
at the solutions if you get stuck, but at least give the 
problems a try first. 
8
Feel something.
Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get 
involved with the stories. Make up your own 
captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke 
is still better than feeling nothing at all.
7
Listen to your brain.
Pay attention to whether your brain is getting 
overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim 
the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time 
for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you 
won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and 
you might even hurt the process.
5
Talk about it. Out loud.
Speaking activates a different part of the brain. If 
you’re trying to understand something, or increase 
your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud. 
Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. 
You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover 
ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were 
reading about it.
4
Make this the last thing you read before bed. 
Or at least the last challenging thing.
Part of the learning (especially the transfer to 
long-term memory) happens after you put the book 
down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more 
processing. If you put in something new during that 
processing time, some of what you just learned will 
be lost. 
3
Read the “There are No Dumb Questions”
That means all of them. They’re not optional 
sidebars, they’re part of the core content! 
Don’t skip them.
Cut this out and stick it 
on your refrigerator.
Here’s what YOU can do to bend 
your brain into submission
2
Do the exercises. Write your own notes.
We put them in, but if we did them for you, that 
would be like having someone else do your workouts 
for you. And don’t just look at the exercises. Use a 
pencil. There’s plenty of evidence that physical 
activity while learning can increase the learning. 
Don’t just read. Stop and think. When the book asks 
you a question, don’t just skip to the answer. Imagine 
that someone really is asking the question. The 
more deeply you force your brain to think, the better 
chance you have of learning and remembering.
Slow down. The more you understand, the 
less you have to memorize.

how to use this book
Read Me
This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately stripped out everything 
that might get in the way of learning whatever it is we’re working on at that point in the 
book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning because the book 
makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.
We start off by teaching how to solve algebraic equations.
Believe it or not, even if you’ve never taken Algebra, you can jump right in and start solving 
for unknowns. You’ll also learn about the deeper motivations for the study of Algebra, and 
why you should learn it in the first place.
Calculators are only for arithmetic you can’t solve easily, NOT for 
solving equations.
There are lots of calculators out there that can do lots of things, including solving equations 
and plotting graphs. Since the entire purpose of working through this book is to learn how 
to solve and graph equations yourself, using a calculator to do it would just cheat you out of 
your learning experience!
If you’re rusty on some pre-Algebra topics, we can help.
You need to be able to work with fractions, decimals, integers, and exponents to get into 
Algebra and solve for unknowns. The good news is that if you have a decent understanding 
of these concepts, but you can’t quite remember how to get a common denominator, there 
is a big appendix at the back to help you. It’s quick and dirty, but it can bring you back up to 
speed on how to work with those tricky pre-Algebra topics.

the intro
Algebra is not just about getting the right “answer.”
There’s a lot in this book about the process: writing out the steps, understanding what’s 
going on at each point, and really understanding what you’re doing. We have taken a 
lot of time to make sure that each exercise is well explained, and there’s a reason for 
it—you’re trying to learn here, right? So don’t just skip to the x = 5 and see if you’re 
right, because that’s only a piece of the answer.
The activities are NOT optional. 
The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. 
Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some will help 
you apply what you’ve learned. Don’t skip the exercises. 
The redundancy is intentional and important. 
One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to really get it. And 
once you finish the book, we want you to remember what you’ve learned. Most reference 
books don’t have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about learning, so you’ll 
see some of the same concepts come up more than once. 
Everyone can learn Algebra, even if you think you’re not a “math 
person.”
You need to leave all of this “I’m not a math person” stuff behind. Everybody is a “math 
person,” you just might not know it yet. You actually do a lot of Algebra every day, it’s 
just not labelled that way. If you haven’t yet found your inner “math person,” or you’re 
rusty, you’ve come to the right place. You’re going to finish the book knowing how to 
handle Algebra. Now get going and solve some equations!

Acknowledgments
Our editors:
Thanks to Sanders Kleinfeld, who took this book from the first 
outline through the first draft.  He also put up with endless questions 
(mostly from Tracey), and let us wax philosophical about the math 
books that 80’s TV stars write. 
And to Brett McLaughlin, who in addition to running the whole 
series, got us from the first draft across the finish line. His feedback 
had a whole lot of “why didn’t we think of that” in it, which was 
incredibly helpful. His understanding about the kids and dog in the 
background on conference calls was also a plus.
Thanks also to Lou Barr, who somehow managed to 
take notes that say things like “Lou, can you make this 
look cool?” and made things look cool. Since neither 
of us have any artistic talent at all, anything that looks 
fantastic is clearly her work.  
To the reviewers:
Thanks to all of you for reading the whole book with such enthusiasm. To Amanda Borcky, for being our sample 
audience and telling us when we were not being cool. To Herbert Tracey, who, in addition to teaching Tracey 
Trig and Calculus, also gave us extremely detailed feedback that made this a much better math book. To Ariana 
Anderson and Shannon Stewart, who, as math teachers, could point out gaps in our assumptions and good 
questions to ask. Finally, to Cary Collett and Dawn Griffiths, who helped with the math and made sure that we 
were keeping true to the Head First way.
To our friends and family:
To all of the Pilones and all of the Chadwicks, if it hadn’t been for your love and support, we wouldn’t have passed 
Algebra the first time!  To Tracey’s math teachers—Mr. Tracey, Mrs. Vesley, and Mrs. Booth—who turned her 
from a being math hater into an engineer; and to Dan’s math teachers—Br. Leahy, Mr. Cleary, Fr. Shea, and 
Mrs. Newell—you saw past him getting his head stuck in the door and put the first draft of this book in motion so 
many years ago....
And last but not least, thanks to Vinny and Nick—the first two projects that Dan and Tracey worked on together—
who put up with a lot of “Daddy and Mommy have a call” and learned more Algebra than any preschooler or 
kindergartner should know.
The O’Reilly team:
To Caitrin McCullough, for the cool website and Karen Shaner, for being both a tech 
reviewer and keeping the review process running smoothly.
To Brittany Smith, the book’s Production Editor, who always answered questions really 
fast, somehow made sense of all of the computer files that went into this thing, and always 
sent happy emails. 
Last but not least, to Laurie Petrycki, who gave us a chance to write a math book that 
we’re very excited about!

we possibly afford it?
what is algebra?

Solving for unknowns...
I don’t know... but it can’t 
be that much, right? The 
salesman said that twelve times 
its price was $22,400, and that 
didn’t seem too much at the time.
Do you ever wish you knew more than know? Well, that’s 
what Algebra’s all about: making unknowns known. By the time you’re 
through this first chapter, you’ll already have a handle on X being a lot more 
than a mark where treasure’s buried. You’ll get a handle on equations, 
keeping both sides of an equation balanced, and why solving for unknowns

It all started with a big gaming sale
Jo has been watching the game system battles for a while now and 
has finally decided on the one she wants. Her favorite system’s on 
sale this week, and she’s ready to buy. But can she afford it? That’s 
where she needs a little help from you.
Jo’s been waiting for the 
right game system to 
come along.
This is the system Jo’s been 
waiting for - it’s on sale... 
but will the system and a few 
accessories cost too much?
I can handle $199 - but is 
that really how much the 
system’s going to cost?

What does a system really cost?
When you buy things—especially expensive electronic things—there are lots of pieces 
that add into the price besides just the number on a sales flyer:  sales tax, an extended 
warranty, shipping and handling, etc. So what will a KillerX system really cost?

solving for unknowns
This is stupid. I thought we were 
supposed to be learning Algebra!
Figuring out the total wasn’t just addition! It 
was solving for an unknown—and that’s 
Algebra. In this case the unknown was how 
much everything was going to cost.
This was the unknown - you had all the 
other information. You knew there was 
some price that Jo was going to have to 
pay to walk out with that console, and 
that was the unknown!
Algebra is about solving for unknowns
Algebra is about finding the missing information that you’re looking for 
by using the information you already have. The unknown could be the cost of 
a car loan, the quantity of soda you need, or how high you can throw a water 
balloon. If you don’t know it, it’s an unknown.
All the other things that you’ll learn in Algebra are just ways to jiggle things 
around to help you find a piece of missing information. There are rules about 
when you can multiply things or when you can bump something from one side 
of an equals sign to another, but at the end of the day, they’re all just tricks to 
help you find that missing piece of information you’re looking for.

Jo’s got more unknowns
So Jo knows how much it will take to buy an awesome gaming 
system, including an extended warranty. But she still doesn’t have any 
games... or another controller... or a headset.
Jo started with  $315.27 in her bank account. Now that she’s paid for 
the console,  how much can Jo spend on accessories? Let’s start by 
writing this out in words:

Here’s the cost

Here’s what’s in her

...and here’s our 
unknown.
Let’s take a closer look at what we just did. First, we’re going to swap out the 
unknown box for the standard Algebra version of an unknown—an x.
There’s no magic to 
the letter x - that’s 
just the most common

We can also turn this around to be:
We’ll talk more about why you can swap 
these around and other tricks you can 
do later in the chapter. The important 
thing for now is that these are the same, 
regardless of whether the x is on the 
right or left.
Understanding a problem and finding the unknown, x, is working with 
Algebra. Using tricks like writing the problem out with words and flipping 
things around are just ways to make finding that unknown possible.

situation is called a variable. In the real world, problems present themselves every day; 
translating them into mathematical equations allows you to solve them.
Q:Will the unknown always be x?
A: Nope. As you progress with math, you’ll see x, y, and z pretty 
often. You can use any letter that you want, though.
Q: Back on page 6, how come you could just flip that equation?
A: All we really did was switch the same equation around, called

Equations are math sentences
Equations, like the one you used earlier to figure out how much Jo could 
spend on accessories, are just math sentences. They’re a mathematical 
way of saying something. So when we talked about Jo’s account balance, 
we were actually using an equation:
Our equation means “The account balance minus how much we spend on the 
console equals how much we have left for accessories.”  So, that means that the 
account balance must equal the cost of  the console plus the money for accessories. 
If we write that sentence as an equation it looks like this:
Both sentences mean the same thing; they’re just phrased differently. 
Over the next few pages, you’ll learn how to rearrange math 
sentences and make sure that you don’t change any values.
The account 
balance...
equals how 
much we spend 
on the console...
...plus how much 
we have left 
for accessories.
Equations can 
be rearranged

different forms of the

Now SOLVE for the unknown
What we really care about here is what x is—the unknown number of games. 
We don’t really care about the seven games on the left side of the equation. In 
fact, we can get rid of that seven as long as we make sure we do the same 
thing to both sides of the equation.
An equals sign means that both sides are the same. So if we take 7 away 
from one side, we have to do the same thing to the other side of the 
equation:.
7 games...
7 games...
10 games...
10 games...
We can take away 7 games by 
subtracting 7 from both sides 
of the equation.
And that leaves us 
with three games left...
hmmm...
So here’s what we have left:
or
Some unknown 
number of games...
Some unknown 
number of games...
Jo is trying to decide if it’s worth it for her to buy a LIVE subscription. She has 
10 games, and 7 of them don’t have any online play. How many does she have 
that can be played online? Does it make sense for her to buy the subscription?
We’re going to jump right 
into the equation without 
the sentence. If it helps, 
you can write it out, but 
just thinking about the 
equation in words first 
should be enough to help.
Hmm, I can only play 3

isolate your variables

           x = 3
You don’t need pictures to do algebra.
What you need is a way to use the operations that you already know 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to solve equations.
The tricky part? You must preserve the equality. Equality means the 
same. When you do something to one side of the equation, you have 
to do the same thing to the other side of the equation. 
Here’s another way to look at Jo’s online problem without pictures:
How does that help! I’m not going to 
spend the rest of my life drawing pictures 
of all my problems.
When you get x all by itself, you’re isolating the variable. That’s 
the most important part of solving an equation. Isolating the variable 
means you’ve gotten the variable by itself on the left side of the 
equation and everything else stacked up over on the right. If you can 
isolate a variable, then you’ve solved the equation—the answer just 
pops out, like x = 3.
Knowing that your goal is to isolate the variable means that you know 
which numbers to move away from the left side. Since you’re trying to 
get x alone, that means that you move the seven, not the 10!
Since 7 - 7 is 0, we end up 
with just X on this side...
And 10 - 7 is 3, which is all 
we needed to know...
... here we subtract 
7 from both sides to 
preserve the equality...
the initial equation for 
Jo’s games.
The answer is going to be 
x = something, so we need 
to get rid of the seven

what is algebra?
So which operation do you use when?
The opposite of addition is subtraction.  So, if some number is being added on 
one side of the equation, and you want to move that number to the other side, you 
can subtract that number from both sides. The math term that describes opposite 
operations is inverse operations.
The basic math operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
An inverse operation is the operation that undoes an operation (like addition undoes 
subtraction). Inverse operations let you shift a number or variable from one side of 
the equation to the other by “undoing” that number on one side of an equation.
The inverse operation for 
addition is subtraction...
This is why when you needed 
to get rid of the seven (an 
added number), you subtracted 
seven from both sides.
Look at the equation and figure out what numbers to move.
Using Jo’s equation, we had to get rid of the 7. That’s because we’re 
trying to isolate the variable, the x.
1
Figure out which operation to use.
You need to use the inverse operation for the number to remove it. For a 
subtracted number, add. For a divided number, multiply, and so on.
2
Preserve equality.
Whatever you decide to do to one side of the equation, you must do to 
the other. That keeps the equation the same.
3
There are other inverse operations out there. Can 
you think of other operation pairs that work?

inverse operations
Head First: And welcome back to Algebra at Night. 
Tonight’s guest... or guests... are inverse operations. So do 
you guys always travel in pairs?
Inverse Ops: Well, yes. We’re not inverse operations 
unless both of us are here. We’re about maintaining 
balance.
Head First: Ah, right. So addition is always paired with 
subtraction, multiplication always with division.. why is 
that?
Inverse Ops: Opposites attract, and multiplication is the 
opposite of division.
Head First: Same with addition and subtraction, right? 
Inverse Ops: Yeah, and we’re all opposites because we 
all undo each other.
Head First:   When you say undo each other, do you 
mean if there’s a multiplication, than division can make it 
go away?
Inverse Ops:  Well, not really go away—remember, our 
job is to keep everything in balance. We just move things 
around. If you have a multiplication you need to move, 
you can undo that multiplication with a division—on both 
sides of the equation.
Head First: Ok, I think I get it—you can move numbers 
from one side of the equation to the other. So you’re 
pretty useful for getting a variable by itself?
Inverse Ops: Absolutely! That’s what we do best. A 
little addition here or multiplication there, and you can get 
almost any variable by itself.
Head First: Very cool! So any last words before we sign 
off?
Inverse Ops: Just a couple thoughts. You have to be 
careful that you keep the equation balanced. There are 
also a few more pairs of us floating around out there, but 
they’ll turn up later.
Head First: Well, it’s been great talking to you—all of 
you—and I appreciate you coming by. Until next time, 
may your multiplications always have a division, and your 
additions subtract.

After I figured out I 
could buy 2 games, I went to buy them 
and it came up to more than $86.32! 
I must have done something wrong - I 
thought I had enough money!
Jo figured out that she had $86.32 
left in her account for accessories. 
She decided that she wants to get 
more games and not worry about the 
headset just yet.
Jo did some quick Algebra to figure 
out how many game she can buy:

Games
A variety of games for 
the oPOD system 
(HD-ISH-5309)

games on special. 
Fix Jo’s problem! Figure out where she went wrong. 
49x = 86.32

always check your work
Fix Jo’s problem! Figure out where Jo went wrong.
Jo messed up working with the sales prices. 
Could she have prevented her mistake?
Cecking your work...
Checking
You’ll find as you go forward with Algebra that the problems 
become more complicated, and it’s pretty easy to make a mistake. 
Jo didn’t divide correctly, and that got her! Checking your work 
doesn’t mean just looking over what you did. It also means using a 
specific technique called substitution. 
Substitution uses your solution in the original equation
Substitution means putting something in for something else. A substitute 
teacher is in the place of a regular teacher, right? To check your work, you 
substitute in the answer you found for the variable in the original equation. 
Substitution is a process that can be used not just for checking your work, 
but for other things too. When we get to more complex equations, and 
equations with more than one variable, you’ll want to use substitution as 
part of the solving process.
Checking Jo’s work:
The answers 
don’t match, 
so Jo’s wrong!
49x = 86.32x
49x/49 = 86.32/49
49(2.007) = 86.32?
89.343 = 86.32
x = 1.76
The division was wrong!
49x = 86.32
2.007 = x
49x/49 = 86.32/49
Jo’s work
49x = 86.32
Take Jo’s 
answer and 
substitute 
it for x in 
the original 
equation.

what is algebra?
Substitution means 
putting a new 
value back into the 
original equation.
Q: So about this “checking your work” thing...
A: Do it. It’s easy to do, and it will tell you if you have 
the right answer!! Seriously. If you have an equation like 
5 + x = 11, and you say x = 2, when you plug 2 back in you 
end up with 5 + 2 = 11, which is seriously wrong. x does not 
equal 2. It’s easy to check your work after you’ve solved for 
the unknown. 
Q: When else will we use substitution?
A: You’ll see it come up again and again—always with 
checking your work, but also as a starting point to solve 
equations with two variables, for graphing lines, figuring out 
inequalities ...keep reading, we’re getting there!
Q: Why are there different notations for 
multiplication and division?
A: It’s really more convenient and a lot less confusing 
than the traditional multiplication and division signs. As 
you get to later chapters, you’ll see more complicated 
equations where being able to show division as a single line 
really makes a huge difference. Multiplication (especially 
with parentheses) is the same way—sometimes what’s 
inside that parentheses can get pretty complicated. Finally, 
multiplying a number by a variable is so common that just 
writing them next to each other is a lot less confusing than 
having a multiplication symbol in between.
Q: When should I use parentheses versus dots 
versus just bumping the number and variable together?
A: There’s no difference between the different notations; 
it’s just whatever is easier and looks cleanest. If you have a 
number times a bunch of things, you can use parentheses. 
We’ll talk a lot more about that in chapter 2. If you have a 
number times a variable, just push them together. As for the 
dot... well, it’s good for variety if you’re bored with the other 
notations. 
 
With division, you almost always see the stacked form, 
unless you’re typing an equation in a word processor or an 
email, where the stacked form is a pain. In those cases, you 
can use the slash.
Q: Do addition and subtraction have other notations, 
too?
A: Nope, they stay the same. Plus means addition, and 
the minus means subtraction, but...
Q: What’s the difference between a negative number 
and subtracting a positive number?
A: As far as working with them, none. That means that 
when you have a -4, it’s the same thing as + (- 4).
Q: There seem to be a lot of elements that go into 
solving an equation, how do I keep track?
A: There are a lot, but they’ll soon become second 
nature. Once you get used to working with equations, you’ll 
automatically use inverse operations to move numbers 
around, you’ll simplify the equation you end up with, and 
then you’ll just keep going until you get that variable by itself.  
 
Later we’ll follow the exact steps, but really they are just 
“what you do” when you get an equation. Probably the 
easiest one to forget is checking your work...make sure you 
do it!

(more) complicated equations
Always start with what you know
The best way to work any problem is to figure out what things 
you know and what things you don’t know. The big unknown in 
this problem is how many friends Paul can bring. Let’s call this 
g for guys. We also know Paul’s got $1,330 in his bank account. 
Paul can spend up to that amount on the trip.
Here’s what we know:
Paul’s Savings Account

Amount

$1330.00
The max Paul can spend is 
$1330 - that’s the first 
“known” in our equation.
But there’s still a lot of things missing. We can’t simply set these 
things equal to each other... that doesn’t make any sense.
What else has to go into the equation to add up to the total cost 
of the trip? Does it matter how many people come?

There’s a COST for each guy
Paul is going to have to spend money on gas to get to Florida. But what 
about food? Tickets? Hotel rooms? Those all depend on how many 
guys come (and Paul is one of those guys). 
So we’ve got to figure out the fixed costs, like gas, and then we’ve got to 
figure out how much each guy costs. That’s got to be multiplied by each 
guy, and added to the fixed costs. And all of that has to be related to 
how much money Paul can actually spend.
So we’ve got something that looks like this:
The fixed costs won’t change, but the total cost goes up as we add 
more guys (g). The question is how do we figure out how much 
each guy costs? 
What else has to go into the equation to add up to the total cost 
of the trip? Does it matter how many people come?
The costs are: gas, hotel, food, and tickets. Some depend on how 
many people come, but not all of them. 
These three depend 
upon how many guys go.
Gas is the same no matter how 
many guys are in the car.

Cost per 
guy
Here’s how many 
people can come,

Each person that

Fixed costs are just 
costs that don’t 
change depending on 
how many guys come.

Gas is our the fixed cost - it 
doesn’t really matter if Paul 
comes by himself or if he 
crams 10 people clown-style 
into his car. So this stays over 
here on the left.
Be sure you didn’t use something like (Paul + Friend #1 
+ Friend #2...) here... because that assumes you 
already know how many friends Paul can bring.
Here’s the important part - each guy needs food, 
a ticket, and a place to crash. We need to multiply 
these costs by the number of guys to figure out 
how much this whole thing is going to be.
And here’s how much it can 
all add up to - we’re going to 
assume Paul is going to spend 
every last penny, so we’ll just use 
the $1330 left in his account.
This is why the number of guys (g) is our unknown... 
we need to figure out how each guy affects the 
cost of the trip.

(more) complicated equations
160 + 410g = 1330
160 + 410g = 1330
Now solve for g... one step at a time
You’ve got an equation (160 + 410g=1330) that can tell you how many 
guys Paul can take on his trip. Back in Chapter 1, you worked equations 
to isolate the variable. In this case, the variable is g, and we can use 
inverse operations to get to just g:
We have to get 160 
off of this side of 
the equation...
...and over to this 
side...
We’ll need to get 
that 410 out of 
the way too...
...but you have to keep the equation equal!
We need to isolate the variable (g) in this equation to figure out how many 
guys can go on the trip. But where should you start? There are two things 
you need to do to get that g buy itself: you’ve got to get rid of the 160 on 
the left side that’s added to 410g, and you’ve also got to get rid of the 410 
that’s multiplied by g. And no matter what you do,  you’ve got to keep the 
sides of the equation equal.
Do we move the 
160 first?
Or the 410?
The cost equation is a multistep equation. You have to deal with both the 160 
and the 410 in order to solve for g. Which should you do first? Will you get 
different answers if you do one before the other? Which is right?

The most important part of equations is that they stay equal on both sides. 
So you could first move the 160 by using subtraction, if you wanted to, or 
you could deal with the 410g part first by using division. So the question is 
really, which is easiest to do first?
If you try to get rid of the 410 first, you’ll need to divide both sides of the 
equation by 410. Since 410g isn’t the only thing on the left side of the 
equation, we have to divide everything by 410, like this:
When you’ve got more 
than one way to solve 
an equation, look for the 
SIMPLEST way to work 
with your equation.
We have to divide 
everything by 410...
These numbers aren’t 
very fun to work with.
- 0.3902 +
- 0.3902
Working with 410 first was fine, but we were left with all those nasty 
decimal numbers to work with. That’s not bad, but without a calculator, it 
might be harder than it really needs to be.
Even though you’ll get the same answers doing things both ways, sometimes 
one particular way is easier. Let’s try and work things out the other way, by 
subtracting the 160 from both sides first...
Seriously... there’s nothing 
wrong with picking the easy way 
out when it comes to Algebra.
Now we subtract 
.03902 from both sides.

160 + 410g = 1330
        410g = 1170
             g = 2.8537 
410    410
Doing the subtraction first was easier, and we got the same answer. It was 
easier for two reasons: you didn’t have to deal with decimals until the end, 
and solving the equation took less steps!
It’s not always easy to determine which steps you should do first, but the 
good news is that even if you don’t pick the easiest strategy, you can still 
get to the right solution. Just follow the rules, and you’ll get the same 
solution, no matter what order you work things out in.
Guys don’t come in fractions. 
The number for g doesn’t seem to 
make sense. What do you think we 
need to do here?
- 160
- 160 +
We have to do the 
same thing to both 
sides of the equation.
Whole numbers are usually easier 
to work with
Instead of dividing everything by 410 and getting that nasty 
160/410 thing, let’s try subtracting 160 from both sides of the 
equation, like this:
See! The 
same answer.
So 2.8537 guys can go on Paul’s 
trip? That doesn’t make any 
sense... How are we supposed to 
take Paul, one other dude, and 
.8537 of a third guy?
Subtracting first left

manipulate the equation
Q: What about the order of operations? Don’t I need to do 
multiplication and division before addition and subtraction?
A: If you have a bunch of additions, subtractions, multiplications, 
and divisions all together that you need to work out, then yes, you 
need to follow the order of operations. But what we’re doing here 
is just manipulating the equation. We’re keeping things equal by 
doing exactly the same thing to each side of the equation. When you 
manipulate an equation, it doesn’t matter what you do first as long as 
you do that thing to both sides of an equation.
Q: Do I always have to solve my equations twice? How would 
I know which operation to do first on a problem?
A: You don’t have to solve problems twice. We just did that here to 
show that either approach works. As for what to do first with different 
problems, well, it depends. When you have the option of doing 
addition or subtraction to get terms from the left to the right, they’re 
usually the easiest to knock out first. Then you have fewer things to 
deal with for later manipulations, like multiplication or division. 
Q: Can there be even more complicated equations? What if 
there are lots and lots of steps?
A: Equations can get really long, and we’ll get to some of 
those later, but the general idea remains the same. You’ll need 
to determine which variable you need to get by itself and then 
manipulate the equation to get that variable alone. 
It doesn’t matter how many times you apply inverse operations or 
multiply both sides of an equation or any other operation. As long as 
you follow the rules, you’ll get the solution you’re after.
Q: When you start with a big long problem, do you have to 
write the problem out with words first?
A: Not really. It’s up to you, but using words is a helpful way to get 
the idea of the problem you’re solving down on paper without getting 
bogged down with numbers. 
Writing out a problem also means you have to step back for a second 
and think about the context of the problem.
	
	
     We’re going to talk a lot more 
about the order of operations.
Don’t worry if you’re still a little 
confused about the order of operations. 
We’ll be using the order over and over in 
the rest of this book. By the time you’re 
through, you’ll be a pro when it comes to 
ordering your operations.

Whoa - hang on. You can afford to 
bring more of us if you don’t pay for a 
hotel room for each of us. We can put 
2 people in a room.
I can bring 2.8 guys, 
including myself. Hmm. O’Brien 
you’re a bio major—can I bring 
0.8 of one of you guys?
So, you technically got a correct solution for g, but 2.8537 is 
probably not the right answer for this particular problem. Since 
Paul can’t bring 0.8 of a person, the right answer to the problem 
is actually 2 guys (including Paul). Since you can’t bring 3 guys (3 
is more than 2.85, so more than Paul can afford), you’ve got to go 
down to 2 guys: that’s Paul and one buddy.
When you’re solving an Algebra problem, part of the problem 
is working the equation... but another part of the problem is 
keeping up with what the problem means. That’s called the 
context of the problem. Math is not just about numbers or 
manipulating equations; it’s about solving real-world problems.
Paul’s buddies are right! Our equation charges each 
guy $300 for the hotel. But we can put two guys in 
each room. How do we fix this? What part of our 
equation has to change? Is the cost for each guy still 
based on the number of guys?

one variable, many appearances
A variable can appear in an equation 
MORE THAN ONE TIME
The hotel rooms cost $300. And right now, we’re multiplying that 
$300 by each guy on the trip.
Wait - we have two g’s in the equation 
now. What are we supposed to do with 
those? Are they the same?
160 + g  (60 + 50 + 300) = 1330
160 + g  (60 + 50) + 300 = 1330
160 + g  (60 + 50) + 150g = 1330
This $300 gets added in, then 
multiplied by the number of guys. So 
each guy costs $300 in hotel fees.
Now the $300 doesn’t get 
multiplied by each guy... but this 
isn’t right... the cost is still related 
to the number of guys going.
Since each guy is paying 
half, we divide $300 
by 2 to get 150.
Then multiply by g to get 
each guy to pay $150.
But now, we need to take that $300 and separate it out. Each 
guy doesn’t have to pay $300 because 2 guys can fit into a 
room. So let’s pull out the $300 hotel fee first:
For every 2 guys, the room costs $300. So for each guy, then, 
the room cost is $150... like this:
YES! If the same variable shows up more than once in an equation, 
the variable has to have the same value. A variable just represents a 
number in an equation. So each time g shows up, it must represent 
the same value. 
In fact, since g represents the same value each time it shows up, you 
can combine terms where g is the variable. For example, 2g + 3g = 
5g. Let’s see how we can use that to help us out...

                   260g = 1170
                   260g = 1170
                       g = 4.5
                   260    260
And here’s our new answer!
g works out to be 4.5 guys, which is the correct answer mathematically, but obviously Paul can’t bring 
half a person. However, by putting two people in a room, now 4 people can come instead of just 2!
Below is the new trip cost equation. Your job was to use the new 
costs to figure out how many guys can go if guys share a room.
So does this answer work? Really, how many guys can come?

First we’ll get rid of the 
parentheses by adding up the values.
Now we can get rid of the 
160 by subtracting 160 from

(more) complicated equations
Q: Why did we plug 4.5 back into the 
equation when we said 4 was the answer 
to the problem?
A: The numerical answer to the equation 
is 4.5. That’s the value that makes all of the 
numbers work out. But since Paul can’t bring 
half a person, 4 is the answer he actually 
needs. But, when we go back to check our 
work, we need to use the mathematically 
correct answer, 4.5.
Q: Is it worth taking all that time to 
check your work?
A: Absolutely. It is crazy-frustrating to go 
through a whole problem and get an answer, 
but get it wrong. That is a totally preventable 
problem if you go back and check your work.
Q: My work looks a little different than 
the solution, but I got the right answer. 
Did I do something wrong?
A: Not at all. With Algebra, you just need 
to apply the rules consistently, and you’ll get 
to the same answer. The solutions we’ve 
presented are the way we would go about 
getting the answer, but they’re definitely not 
the only way.
Q: When we isolated the variable, how 
did you know to subtract before you 
divided?
A: We were trying to minimize the number 
of terms we’d have in our division. If you can 
reduce the number of terms in the equation 
by combining like terms, that usually makes 
things easier for later steps. There will be 
fewer terms to deal with. By subtracting both 
sides, we could get rid of the 160 altogether, 
and only have to divide one term by 260.
Q: What if I miss combining a term?
A: No problem. As long as you manipulate 
the equation using the rules properly, you 
will not get a wrong answer... but your 
problem may get more complicated. 
If you do start to feel like you’re going down 
the wrong road, don’t feel like you have to 
keep going that way. Just go back to your 
original problem and start over.
Q: How can this be math if there is 
more than one way to do the problem? 
Isn’t there supposed to be just one right 
answer?
A: There’s a big difference between “one 
right answer” and “one way to get there.” A 
big part of mathematics is that there are 
different ways to solve problems and still 
arrive at the same (correct) answer.  
For example, you could do away with 
multiplication and just use lots of additions. 
But using multiplication is another way to get 
to the same answer. Different problems will 
need different techniques, but you should 
always end up at the same place when 
you’re done.
Algebra is about 
solving for an 
unknown, but it’s also 
about making smart 
choices about how to 
get to that solution.

 A term is a piece of an equation.
No matter how many terms you 

have, you’re still looking to isolate 
the variable in order to solve an 
equation.
Whether you’re manipulating an

Pajama Death’s Profit
This tour for Pajama Death is pretty important. They make most of their money 
on the road (the music industry is a tough business). The deal Pajama Death 
has with the record company is that they get the same percentage of profit from 
all of the different revenue they make on tour. In order for the band to make 
$15,000 a show, what is the minimum percentage of the revenue they need to 
get from the record label? 
Touring Revenue
1. Avg. Food Sales—$17,000/night
2. CDs (sold at the show)—$10/each, 100 per show.
3. T-shirts—$15/each, 800 sold per show
4. Tickets—$50/each, 4,000 seats per venue.
A couple of hints: a percentage 
will be a decimal or fraction in

multi-variable equations
What’s a road trip without some girls?
You’ve figured out how many guys can come, but what about girlfriends? 
Paul doesn’t have any more money, so if girls are coming, Paul can’t bring 
as many guys. Not only that, but girls might not cost as much as guys to 
bring...
So there are a few things we’ll need to change with the equation to add 
girls to the mix:
	
- Girls don’t want to share a room with a guy—they’re going to 
need their own hotel rooms.
	
- Girls only need $30 for food.
The problem we have is that our current equation multiplies the number 
of guys coming on the trip by their costs:
This is Paul’s 
girlfriend, 
Amanda.
Number of 
girls to take
Money Paul

Number of

I want to go too! And I’m not 
real excited about being the 
only girl, so I want to bring 
some friends..
Here we multiply the number of guys times the 
cost per guy... but now we’ve got girls that cost a 
different amount. We need to make some changes...
We need another variable
Since girls have a different cost associated with them, we need to treat them 
separately in our equation. We’re going to have to introduce another variable. 
Let’s call this variable r for girls (since g is already taken...). Now our equation 
looks something like this:

Use the information about cost per guy and the information 
about cost per girl to write up the new equation we need to solve 
to figure out who can come.
We did these terms already. They are 
the same as earlier in the chapter. 
Gas + g  (food + ticket price) + g  (hotel/2) + r  (food + ticket) + r  (hotel/2) = $1330
These are the same type of costs for 
the girls, just some different values.
160 + g  (60 + 50) + 150g + r  (30 + 50) + 150r = 1330
Food is $30 for each girl.
Tickets are the 
same, guys or girls.
Hotel room costs the 
same for girls, but it 
has to be girls only!
The equation really hasn’t changed 
much - it’s just similar costs with 
an additional variable, r.
160 + 110g + 150g + 80r + 150r = 1330
-160 + 160 + 260g + 230r = 1330 - 160
160 + 260g + 230r = 1330
260g + 230r = 1170
Get all the numbers 
on one side.

terms, you can only combine

Now what do we do? We have

Hmm - how does this relate to

with g’s and r’s?
Two variables seem to be a problem, but it’s something we can handle. 
Just think about how you worked with one variable. You put together a 
equation to say how things relate to each other in terms of the variable. 
So with just guys, we were putting the cost of the trip in terms of the 
number of guys going, the g variable. Even the individual parts of the 
trip were that way, like how we figured out the cost of the hotel:
Great question. For that, we need 
to talk a little bit more about what 
exactly a term is...

terms are algebraic chunks
A term is a chunk of an algebraic equation
It’s important to make a distinction between a variable and a term. A variable is some 
letter we use to stand in for something that’s unknown: g for guys, r for girls, etc. A term, 
on the other hand, is just a piece of an equation. So, the equation 6g + 10g = 32 only has 
one variable, g, but it has three terms: 6g, 10g, and 32. When we talk about combining 
like terms, it just means pick the terms that have the same variable, 6g and 10g, and 
combine them: 6g + 10g, so 16g.
But how do you figure out how many terms there are in an equation? They’re held together 
by multiplication (or division). So, 60b is a term, but 60 + b is two terms. How about 
3(x+2)? Well, that’s just one term. Everything is glued together because everything is 
multiplied by 3.
Term - A piece of an algebraic statement that is 
related by multiplication or division.
“In terms of” is the secret to multiple variables in an equation
In Algebra, a lot of expressions have multiple variables.  The most common 
equations you will see in multiple variables will be x and y, even though in our 
equation, we’ve got g and r.
When you get into multiple variable equations, this is where “in terms of ” 
really starts to matter. If you have an equation in two variables: 
This is the key to 
our guy-girl problem 
- we’ll come back to 
this in just a second...
It’s much easier to work with if you get one variable “in terms of ” the 
other. That makes substitution possible.
A single equation in two variables can not be solved without an 
additional relationship.
An equation in two variables establishes a proportional relationship 
between the two variables.

(more) complicated equations
I think we should have 
the same number of 
girls as guys.
Finish up the road trip equation, and solve for g. Then 
solve for r.
Only do the division to 
one decimal place. (We 
can’t bring less than 1 
a whole person, right?)
What’s the relationship between  
guys and girls?
From what we know about multiple variables in 
an equation, we have to find another relationship 
between guys and girls (g & r) in order to get any 
further with Paul’s problem. To make things fair, 
let’s say that we have to bring the same number of 
guys and girls. That’s a new relationship!
If we say we have to have the same number of guys 
and girls coming on the trip, then we can say g = r. 
Once we say that, everywhere you see an r, you can 
substitute in a g (since they are equal). Suddenly the 
equation looks a whole lot more solvable...
260g + 230r = 1170
Since g = r, we can substitute 
g wherever we have an r...

66    Chapter 2
what’s the context?
Q: Why did we only write part of the 
decimal, and not the whole thing?
A: Because for this problem, we can 
only bring whole people. You could round 
down to the nearest whole person and 
just show two decimal places, but to avoid 
confusion, we used one decimal place. 
Remember to always think about the context 
of the problem. The math might work out to 
2.387755102 people, but who really wants to 
be that .387755102 part?
Q: So can we just say that g = r?
A: Sure, because that’s the second 
relationship (equation) that we were given 
for this problem. It was part of the problem 
statement, and we just worked with it to 
solve our initial equation. Knowing that g = r 
means that you can substitute g back in for 
r in the original equation and then solve for 
one variable. 
Q: Can it sometimes be the end of the 
problem if you don’ t have a number? 
What if you can only get an equation in 
terms of two variables?
A: Depending upon your problem, that 
may be all you need. It’s another case of 
needing to think about the entire problem, 
not just the equation. The goal may just be 
the proportion of the variables and not a 
numerical answer.
Yor job was to finish up the road trip equation, and solve for 
g. Then solve for r.
Combine like terms
We only show one decimal but the 
full answer is 2.387755102...
Going back to the new g = r relationship, you also know 
that r =2.3. That makes sense, because the total number 
of g + r is still 4.6, just like when it was just guys.
260g + 230r = 1170
490g = 1170
490g = 1170
490     490
g = 2.3 and r = 2.3

160 + 110g + 150g = 1330
        160 + 260g = 1330
 -160 + 160 + 260g = 1330 - 160
                   260g = 1170
                   260g = 1170
                       g = 4.5
                   260    260
160 + g  (60 + 50) + 150g = 1330
First we’ll get rid of the 
parentheses by adding up the values.
Now we can get rid of the 
160 by subtracting 160 from 
both sides of the equation.
Now to get the g by 
itself we need to divide 
both sides by 260.
Then combine the like terms 
(110 + 150 = 260)..

rules for numeric operations
Kate is right because Kate’s answer 
follows the rules for working with numbers.
Kate solved the expression properly because she used the 
order of operations. She got the correct answer because 
she followed that order—which is really just a rule for 
working with numbers—precisely.
If you don’t follow the rules 
nothing’s going to work out 
the way it’s supposed to.
Jack DIDN’T follow the rules, so Jack 
got the wrong answer.
Jack worked his problem from left to right. That seems 
pretty logical, but since that’s not what everyone else 
doing Algebra has agreed on, he’s not going to get the 
right answer to problems.
Equations and expressions are written to communicate 
an order. That order needs to be the same for 
everyone who works with the expression, or 
there wouldn’t be any right answers. Hello math chaos!
You need to learn and use the order of operations to 
solve problems, and that’s what we’re going to do next. 
That way, you can be sure you—and the Math or No 
Math contestants—are following the rules.
The order of operations is one 
of the ways everyone can get the 
same answer to the same problem.

there’s order to algebra
There’s an order for working expressions
The order you’re supposed to work with numbers in a math expression is called 
the order of operations. If you always follow the order of operations, you’ll 
get the same answers to problems that everyone else does. Here’s the order:
^ h
Anything in here
This is an exponent.
You need to work through 
and get all of those pieces 
simplified first and write 
those down.
After simplifying inside the 
parentheses, the exponent 
needs to go next.
Multiplication and division 
are the exact opposite of 
each other, so they are the 
same “strength” operation.
Addition & subtraction 
are also opposites.
Addition & subtraction are 
the “weakest” operations, 
so they go last.

Parentheses include everything that is grouped in the expression. 
First, do...
Exponents
Everything in the expression that is raised to a power, any power (that 
includes roots, too).
Then, do...
Multiplication & Division
These operations are equal in order, so work left to right, simplifying both 
the multiplication and division parts of the expression:
Next, do...
Addition & Subtraction
Addition and subtraction are equal in terms of the order, so work from left 
to right doing all the addition and subtraction. Once you’ve finished that, 
the expression should be simplified.
Last, do...

Math Magnets Solution
Your job is to figure out what the next thing to do in the problem is. 
Use the order of operations, and place the correct magnet for the 
operation you’d do next.
Exponent
Multiplication
Exponent
You should drop the parentheses, and 
then do the exponent (the square root).
Since everything is grouped over the 2, 
you need to simplify inside the parentheses 
-and in there the exponent goes first.
Inside the parentheses is 
simplified, so the next thing 
is multiplication.
The addition goes first because 
it’s grouped over the division sign.
You still need to work inside the parentheses - but you need to 
handle the exponent inside first - and don’t forget that roots 
are just another way of writing exponents.

rules for numeric operations
Q: Where did the order of operations 
come from?
A: It was established by early 
mathematicians (geeky people who do 
Algebra for fun) who were trying to compare 
their work. The order let those folks talk to 
each other and get the same answers for 
their problems, which is a pretty big deal.
Q: Why did the order of operations get 
set up this way?
A: The strongest operations go first. 
Parentheses are a way to say, “Do this first!” 
Then, exponents, and then multiplication and 
division. Finally, addition and subtraction. 
And we work on what’s what’s left by moving 
from left to right because that’s the way we 
read. 
Q: Are roots exponents?
A: Yes, which means that they go second 
in the order of operations. If you need a 
refresher on the details, just turn to the 
appendix, where exponents and roots are 
discussed. A root is just an expression raised 
to a fractional power, like 1/2 or 1/3 (for 
square root and cube root respectively).
Q: Do inverse operations always go 
together in the order of operations?
A: They do. Addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division are pretty 
straightforward. Exponents and roots are 
also inverse operations.
Q: Do I have to memorize this?
A: Yes, but if you just think of the 
operations going in order of strength that 
should help.
Q: Do I need to reduce fractions right 
away?
A: The fractions are up to you. If 
you want to work with large numerators 
and denominators, you can (but it’s not 
recommended).
Q: So are fractions really division, or 
can you leave fractions alone?
A: Both. In the case of a fraction, you’re 
not changing the value of the number, just 
how it’s expressed (1/2 vs. 0.5), so you can 
work with it either way. If you want to divide 
your fractions to get a number like 0.5, you 
can... or you can leave fractions as they are.
Q: When can you drop the 
parentheses? Do they need to stay after 
you did what was inside? 
A: That’s up to you. Just like the fractions, 
when you’ve combined whatever was in a 
set of parentheses and you’re down to the 
most simplified form, you’re done. Some 
people like to keep the parentheses to 
indicate multiplication or to clarify exponents, 
but it’s not required.
Q: This seems like a lot of steps. Is it 
hard to keep track of all this?
A: It can be, that’s why you should write 
down your work as you’re solving a problem. 
In fact, since Jack wrote down his steps, we 
were able to figure out where he made his 
mistakes, and why he got a wrong answer.
It’s a good idea to 
write down what 
your expression looks 
like at each step. 
You can keep track 
of what you did and 
check your work.

rules for numeric operations
What? Kate totally blew off 
the order of operations, but 
got the right answer. What’s 
that about?
There are properties as well as rules.
Kate didn’t ignore the order of operations; she 
just used some other properties of numbers first. 
Kate used the associative and commutative 
properties to work with her equation, and then 
applied the order of operations.
Properties like the associative and commutative 
properties are really just another type of rule... and 
you can apply these properties before, during, or after 
applying the order of operations. 
Go back and look at Kate’s work. Circle where 
you think she used a special property. Don’t turn 
the page until you think you know where Kate 
did something sneaky.

You can re-group your equations
The associative property lets you change the grouping of 
numbers in addition or multiplication operations. Suppose 
you’ve got a bunch of numbers you need to add. You can 
change the groupings of those numbers around all you want. 
In fact, that’s what Kate did:
What’s going on here? Because all of the operations are addition, 
the parentheses don’t affect the outcome. The associative property 
says that when you’re performing addition or multiplication, 
grouping does not affect the outcome, so you can regroup those 
types of problems all you need.
You can take a problem like 10 x (4.2 x 0.225) and reorder it 
to something easier, like (10 x 4.2) x 0.225. It’s much easier to 
multiple things by 10 than 0.225, so it’s better to rearrange the 
grouping of this problem some.
Kate used the associative property 
to re-group parts of her problem. 
So she worked with common 
denominators next to each other 
first, and then did the rest.
The Associative Property - Changing the groupings 
of a set of numbers being added or multiplied 
does not change the outcome of the operation.

rules for numeric operations
Q: So do we need the order of operations 
or not?
A: Yes - the order of operations 
(parentheses, exponents, multiplication & 
division, addition & subtraction) is the order in 
which you need to simplify a problem. With the 
associative property, you are not changing the 
order of operations—you’ll still do parentheses 
first—you’re just moving certain parts of a 
problem around.
Q: What’s the point of the associative 
property anyway? So what if I can move 
groupings around?
A: The associative property means you 
can work through an expression in the easiest, 
fastest way. Grouping together fractions that 
are easy to work with saves tons of common 
denominator time, and you can do the same 
thing with decimals, too. 
Grouping things in terms of how you want to 
work on them can sometimes help you get 
started on a tough problem, too! 
Q: Are there more properties?
A: Yes - we’re going to talk about two 
more in the next few pages, the commutative 
property and the distributive property. The 
commutative property lets you reorder items 
in an equation. The distributive property helps 
spread multiplication and division out across 
the equation (or pull it together into a single 
term, but we’ll get to that later).
Q: So the associative property lets me 
change the order of numbers, right?
A: No - the associative property just says 
you can change the grouping of numbers that 
are added or multiplied. But you can’t change 
any orderings, or move numbers from one part 
of your problem to another.  
However, all is not lost, There is a property that 
will help you out with ordering: the commutative 
property. Once you get that figured out, you’ll 
be able to reorder and regroup. Keep reading...
The associative 
property says 
you can change 
groupings in 
addition or 
multiplication, 
but NOT with 
subtraction or 
division!
	
       The associative property only works for 
addition or multiplication - NOT subtraction 
and division.
This means you cannot regroup subtraction or division 
problems without changing the value of the solution. You 
have to solve expressions with subtraction and division as written.

90    Chapter 3
re-order your problem
It looks like Kate did more 
than just re-group things... she 
re-ordered things too. So is 
there a property that lets you 
move numbers around, too?
Kate did something 
tricky with the order 
of these numbers.
You can re-order numbers as well 
as re-group them... using the 
commutative property. 
The commutative property deals with the 
order of the terms in addition or multiplication 
operations. The commutative property says 
that you can add the numbers involved in 
addition operations or multiply the numbers 
in multiplication operations in any order 
and not affect the value of your answer.
You still have to follow the 
order of operations and 
do multiplications before 
additions though!
The Commutative Property - You can change the order 
that terms are added or multiplied without changing the 
value of the answer.

rules for numeric operations
Associative Property: Hi, commutative. Is 
everything all right? You look a little mixed up.
Commutative Property: Ha, I get it. Mixing it 
up is my specialty. If you have some additions or 
multiplications, I can move the numbers around 
without causing any problems.
Associative: Nice. I work with addition or 
multiplication too, but I’m not allowed to jiggle 
numbers around. I just work with parentheses.
Commutative: Wait, aren’t parentheses the top of 
the food chain in the order of operations?
Associative: Yes, and that’s who I work with. 
There are strict rules, though. I can’t mess with the 
order of operations or change the answer, so I can 
only move parentheses around if they are all around 
additions or multiplications.
Commutative: Yeah, I have the same rules. I can’t 
change the answer, so I can only reorder numbers 
in addition or multiplication, too. I guess you’re not 
allowed to do anything with division or subtraction 
either, right?
Associative: Right. Subtracting or dividing 
changes the answer, so I can’t change those types of 
groupings.
Commutative: Same problem over here. Order is 
really important for subtraction and division, I guess, 
so I have to keep my hands off. 
Associative: You know, I think we need to clear 
something up, as long as we’re chatting here.
Commutative: What?
Associative: That both of us can be used outside 
of the order of operations without changing the 
answer.
Commutative: Sure. I’m used to it, but I guess that 
can seem confusing. We work any time! Addition or 
multiplication, they can be regrouped or reordered at 
any point when you’re simplifying.
Associative: See, we’re always helpful. Oh... 
before I go, did you hear the one about the addition 
expression that was wrongly accused?
Commutative: It had its sentence commuted. 
Associative: No, what about it?

The problem’s worth a single point again, and 
there’s a bonus point for solving the problem as

another win for kate?
Instead of 
simplifying inside the 
parentheses, Kate 
multiplied each term 
inside by 12.
These numbers are 
what’s left after 
the denominators are 
canceled out
All that was left was 
to do the exponent and 
then add and subtract.
Jack had to 
get all the 
fractions 
with the same 
denominators.
The exponent 
is next.
Here’s where Jack lost: 
dealing with all these 
fractions.
Jack canceled 
things out here.

The distributive property lets you multiply over 
several numbers. (And it’s not a trick, really.)
Kate got rid of all the fractions in one step by multiplying all 
her fractions by 12. That canceled her denominators. When you 
multiply everything in a group by the same numbers, you’re using 
the distributive property. Let’s take a closer look at what 
exactly Kate did... and how you can do the same thing.

Here’s Kate’s work, broken down even 
further. So what’s really going on?
Kate multiplied 
each term 
inside the 
parentheses by 
12.
Kate didn’t change 
anything else at 
this step.
Here, Kate 
simplified each 
fraction by 
dividing out the 
denominators.
These factors 
are all that was 
left after the 
denominators were 
canceled out.
She went on with the 
order of operations.
Are you kidding me? Every time 
we figure out how to judge these 
things, Kate pulls out another trick.

distribute, distribute
When you take a value and multiply over a grouping, you’re distributing 
that value. The distributive property says that if you have two groups 
multiplied together, you can simplify the groups, then multiply; or multiply 
first and then simplify.
Here’s the piece of Kate’s work where she used the distributive property:

Here’s what Kate did. She multiplied 
through first, then simplified.
Here’s the work if you simplify 
inside the parentheses first, and 
then multiply.
These two are the same - 
working inside the parentheses 
first or multiplying first.
Q: Can we multiply before we do the parentheses?
A: Yes. If you have a situation where you’re multiplying two groups 
together, you can multiply and then simplify; or you can simplify and 
then multiply.
Q: Isn’t the distributive property ignoring the order of 
operations?
A: No, it’s just knowing when you can work around the order of 
operations. Just like with the associative and commutative properties, 
the distributive property is about working with problems in a simpler, 
more efficient way. And these properties work with the order of 
operations, not against them.
Q: What if there is subtraction or division inside the 
parentheses?
A: It doesn’t matter. You just have to keep the same operators 
after you distribute a value that’s outside the parentheses. If a 
number is subtracted inside the parentheses, it’s still subtracted after 
the distribution.
Q: So parentheses don’t have to go first?
A: Not if you’re multiplying what’s in the parentheses by a number. 
In that case, you can distribute the number over the grouping.
The 12 outside 
the parentheses is 
multiplied with each 
number inside the 
parentheses.

I think that using the order of operations 
was faster since there were fewer steps.
The order of operations was faster  
because the fractions went away.

How am I supposed to remember all this? 
First there was the order of operations, and now 
there are all these rules... it’s like a paragraph 
for each one. I’m supposed to memorize these?
The Commutative Property
You can change the order 
of the terms with addition 
or multiplication without 
changing the results.
The Associative Property
You can change the grouping of 
terms with addition or multiplication 
without changing the outcome.
The Distributive Property
A number being multiplied by 
a group produces the same 
result by either simplifying the 
group and then multiplying, or 
multiplying each term within the 
group and then simplifying.
You can memorize some general 
equations, not a lot of text.
Remembering all those sentences for each 
property is a pain... and this is math, not 
composition! Fortunately, we can turn these 
rules into some simple equations.
But to do that, we need a way to represent 
numbers... we need constants. But what 
exactly is a constant?

102    Chapter 3
constants stand in
A constant stands in for a number
A constant is a term used to describe an unknown in an 
equation that represents a number that doesn’t change. In 
other words, a letter “a” on one side of an equation is the 
same number as an “a” on the other side of an equation. The 
constant just represents a number.
Constants are great for turning specific problems into more 
general ones because we can use letters instead of specific 
numbers. For example...
The Commutative Property
You can change the order 
of the terms with addition 
or multiplication without 
changing the results.

This is a very specific problem, and

We can take 2,

...we’ll call 8 “b”...
...and call 16 “c.”
At first, it might seem like these letters are just 
as hard to remember as a bunch of sentences. 
But let’s make things even simpler:
This is the commutative property 
for multiplication.
This is the commutative property

A general equation

Roll the credits...
After going through Kate’s work, we figured out that 
she got all the problems right and was the fastest.
Kate solved the first question using the order 
of operations.
After seeing what happened with Jack, everybody can’t just 
go their own way, so the order of operations is important.
1
Kate solved the second question using the 
associative and commutative properties before 
applying the order of operations.
Kate got done faster and smarter and could make the 
fractions much easier.
2
Kate got the third question right, faster, by 
using the distributive property first, and then 
the order of operations.
Kate made fractions much easier by distributing.
3
Jack was the runner up. He learned the order of operations from his first problem, 
but he needed some more properties up his sleeve to compete with Kate.
Jack got the first question wrong because he didn’t follow the 
order of operations.
Jack tried to solve the easiest parts of the question first, regardless of the 
order of operations... and completely missed the question.
1
Jack got question two right by using the order of operations.
Unfortunately, Jack didn’t use the associative or commutative properties, so it 
took him longer than Kate to solve question two.
2
Jack got question three right, too, but he lost the speed 
competition again.
The order of operations never let him down, but it slowed him down!

Could you multiply that again? Could you multiply that again? 
There’s another way to express multiplication that’s repeated over and over and over 
again, without just repeating yourself. Exponents are a way of repeating multiplication. 
But there’s more to exponents, including some smaller-than-usual numbers (and we don’t 
just mean fractions). In this chapter, you’ll brush up on bases, roots, and radicals, all 
without getting arrested for any sit-in protests. And, as usual, zero and one come with 
their own problems... so jump into a podcasting exponentiation extravaganza.

Addie’s been getting  a lot more listeners lately. To take

an even better podcast... but that takes a lot of cash.
Addie’s got a website to host her podcasts, and she

She’s lined up some possible sponsors, but they won’t 
help out until Addie proves she can get some real traffic

Addie knows she’s got big fans. Here’s a letter she’s worked up 
to send out to her 3 top listeners:
Dear TOP 3 Listeners,
I’m trying to get some sponsors for the podcast 
so we can buy some new equipment. There will be 
some advertisers tracking the hits to the site 
over the next two weeks, and we need to have 
5,000,000 hits in a single day.
Please make sure that you visit the site today 
and send this email out to 3 more people.  If 
everyone keeps visiting the site and emailing 3 
new people for 14 days, I think we’ll make it!
Thanks,
Addie from the StarTalk Podcast

I keep trying to work this out with my calculator, but I 
keep losing count of how many threes I’ve put in.
What?

Well, it’s 14 days, and if everybody who gets the 
email hits the site, that’s 3 times 3 for each day.
Here’s an image. Here are the first 2 rounds.
Exactly.
Exponents are a shorthand way to show

The base is the number being multiplied (in Addie’s case, 3), and the exponent is the 
number of times you repeat it (in Addie’s case, 14). Those two numbers are all you need 
to put in your calculator, and you’ll get the answer.
This means multiply x 
by itself “a” times.

Rewrite Addie’s equation using exponent notation, and solve (using a calculator to get the 
number is a good idea).

Can Addie and Alex get enough hits?
Alex has offered to send off another round of emails for Addie.  He’ll start 
with 3 friends, just like she did, and try to help get 5,000,000 hits in 14 days. 
To figure out the total number of hits, you’ll need to figure out how to add up 
both groups that Addie’s working with. In chapter 2, you combined like terms 
to help Paul on his road trip, and this is the same idea. You may remember 
from chapter 2 that a term is any part of an equation held together with 
multiplication or division. Since an exponent is just a shorthand version of 
multiplication, that means exponential terms with the same base and 
the same exponent are like terms.
With exponents, you can combine terms that have the same base. Let’s try that 
out and see how it works:

Wait.  Why is that 
2(314) and not (314)2?
Because (314)2 is multiplication, not addition.
A term is something held together by multiplication, which 
means that the entire exponential term is treated as a group.
When you group two like terms together, you’re adding those 
terms together. But if you take those two terms and use 
exponents (that 2 at the end of (314)2 ), then you’re multiplying, 
and that’s not what we want. Look:
314 is one term, 
not two.
314 + 314 = 2(314)
(314)2 = 314  314
This term
plus this 
term
means two of 
the same term.
Remember - the exponent 
means you multiply.
This is just another way to write 
multiply 314 by itself 2 times.

exponent operations
Q: : Why use exponents and not just multiplication?
A: Because it can save you a bunch of work. Writing out a value to 
multiply over and over again is tedious and leads to error. And when 
the numbers start to get really big (like an exponent of 14), they are 
just impossible to deal with otherwise.
Q: Why do you need the same base and the same exponent 
to do addition and subtraction?
A: Because they need to be like terms. Remember that 
exponents are a shorthand for multiplication.  Because of the order 
of operations, you can’t add two multiplication expressions together 
without doing the multiplications first... unless you’ve got like terms.  
If the expressions are like terms, then you can collect them together 
into a single term. That’s exactly what adding exponential terms with 
the same base and exponent does!
Q: Where are exponents in the order of operations?
A: They’re second. Since exponents are just a more powerful form 
of multiplication, they go before multiplication. So it’s parentheses, 
exponents, then multiplication and division.
Q: How do you work with exponents with different bases?
A: We’re going to be looking at those next. But fair warning, 
there’s not much you can do to make those problems simpler. If you 
have two bases, then there are two things that need to be multiplied, 
divided, or whatever. There’s not a good way to combine terms like 
that since you’ve got to keep track of both bases separately.
Q: What happens if I’m dividing exponential terms and the 
exponent becomes negative?
A: Great question! When you divide exponential terms, you 
subtract the exponents. This means that you could end up with a 
negative exponent.  The good news is that this is easy to deal with.   
A negative exponent just means 1 over the positive exponential term.  
So: 
	
2-1 is 1/2, 
	
x-25 is 1/x25 
...and so on.

Since those terms have different 
bases, they can’t be combined as 
variables, right? 
Different bases = NOT like terms.
Terms with different bases are not like terms (regardless of the exponent). 
They just don’t have anything in common. As exponential terms, they’re 
not multiplying the same number, regardless of how many times.
As we saw earlier, 
they’re only like 
terms if the base 
AND the exponent 
are the same.
You can’t add exponents with different bases
If we just talk about the bit of Addie’s equation that has two terms, it 
looks like this:
xb - yc = ?
This is just a piece 
of Addie’s equation.
You know that you can’t add or subtract these two because they’re not 
like terms. Multiplication and division don’t work either. Exponential 
terms being multiplied together just get written together, like this:

exponents first
Q: Do I really have to memorize all of these rules for working 
with exponents?
A: No, because you can always work through these equations by 
working out each term separately. But if you can remember these 
rules, you’ll be able to combine like terms and solve equations more 
quickly. It’s much easier to combine terms and do one calculation. 
That’s a lot better than working out a ton of terms separately, 
especially if the terms can be combined because they’re like terms.
Q: What if the bases are different and the exponents are the 
same?
A: Well, there’s a little bit you can do there. If the exponents are 
the same, then each term is being multiplied the same number of 
times, so you CAN mush them together, like this: 
It only works because of the commutative and associative properties. 
This is all just multiplication, so you can mix up the order, and it will 
still work.
Q: So what about that Brain Power?  How could you show it 
without solving the math?
A: You can do it with variables, so instead of 3 and 4, let’s use x 
and y.  Then we have x2y3 = x●x●y●y●y and 
(xy)(2)(3)=(xy)6=xy●xy●xy●xy●xy●xy = 
You can just look at those two and see they’re not equal.
The order of operations says exponents FIRST
You can’t split up bases and combine different exponents because each base has 
to stay with its own exponent. The order of operations says that exponents go 
before multiplication. That means the exponents have to be simplified before 
they can be combined with something else.

A root is the INVERSE of an exponent
We need an operation that can unravel an exponent. So when we have the 
exponent, what’s the base to get a certain answer? Well, that’s the root. When 
you find a root of something, you’re finding the number that can be 
multiplied over and over to reach the final number. 
For Addie, we need take the ninth root of both sides of her equation. That 
will isolate x and give us a numeric value on the other side.  
This is the equation 
we started with
We take the ninth root of both 
sides. This undoes the exponent 
of nine on the right.
How did you figure out 
that crazy root? Do you have 
to be some sort of times-

a root key and the root you want (like 9 or 3). 
Let’s look at a little closer at roots:
This is the root.
If you wanted to read this, you’d say, “The second root of nine is three.” The 
actual root is three, and it’s the number that you multiply twice by itself to find the 
number under the radical. So, to find the ninth root for Addie, all you need is a 
calculator.
We know this side needs to be x because 
the root and the exponent are the same, 
and they cancel each other out.
32 = 9 (See the 
connection?)
734,166 = x9
Addie’s equation.
We need the 9th 
root here.

exponent operations
Q: Just put the problem in a 
calculator? Is that for real?
A: There are actually several ways to find 
roots of numbers. There are tables where 
you can look them up, there’s even a way 
to find them by hand that looks like long 
division. But honestly, they’re all really old 
school. For most folks, a calculator is perfect. 
Another way to get near the root of a number 
is to remember the perfect squares (2x2=4, 
3x3=9,etc.). Then you can get an idea of 
what numbres might at least be close to 
what you’re looking for.
Q: What’s the inverse operation of 
exponents? The radical?
A: Not quite. It’s finding the root.  The 
radical is the symbol for the operation. It’s 
just like the dot symbolizing multiplication.
Q: What if I see a radical without an 
index number?
A: Assume an index of 2. That’s the 
square root. It’s convention that if there isn’t 
an index, then the equation is talking about 
the square root.
Q: Can you have a fractional 
exponent?
A: Yes.  That simply means you should 
take the root of the base.  For example, if 
you see 1/2 as an exponent, it means square 
root. 1/3 would be the third root, and so on.  
Q: My calculator doesn’t have a 9th 
root button, what do I do?
A: You can write a root as fractional 
exponent. So, a ninth root can be written 
as                         or  
 
Most calculators have an exponent button. 
So you could just put in a root of (1/9) and 
get the same answer.
Q: Will I ever need to solve for an 
exponent and not the base?
A: Not anytime soon. There are more 
operations out there that you can use to do 
this sort of problem, but they’re well beyond 
this book. Don’t worry about it for now. (Isn’t 
that good to hear!) 
Q: What about an exponent of 0?
A: Any number raised to the 0 power is 
one. Why? If you go back to the division 
of exponents, you subtract the bottom 
exponent from the top exponent.  If you end 
up with the same term on the top and the 
bottom, then it’s the base to the 0 power. 
That’s always the number “1.”
Q: What about an exponent of 1?
A: Any number raised to an exponent of 
1 is itself. That means an exponent of one 
is implied over EVERY number and EVERY 
variable. It can come in handy sometimes to 
know that.
Q: Can an exponent be negative?
A: Yes - it means that it’s the exponent in 
the denominator. So 
 
That ties right in with subtracting exponents 
again. Since there’s no exponent in the 
numerator, it’s a negative exponent.
Q: Can you use negative exponents to 
get rid of fractions?
A: Yes. If you have an expression with 
fractions in it, you just rewrite the expression 
with the denominators as negative 
exponents. This really only helps if you find 
working with exponents easier than working 
with fractions. Of course, some people prefer 
that, and it’s a perfectly okay way to work.  
This also works the other way: if you think 
fractions are easier than exponents, just pull 
out all your negative exponents and rewrite 
them as fractions.
Q:  I’ve heard of something called the 
principle root. What’s that about?
A: When we talk about finding roots, 
we’re actually talking about finding the 
principle root.  That’s the positive root of a 
value.  There are other roots to numbers, too, 
though. The most common is the negative 
root.  For example, the principle square root 
of 9 is 3, but -3 is a square root of 9, too, 
since (-3)(-3) = 9.

Ever looked at an equation and thought, “But what the heck does that mean?” 
In times like that, you just might need a visual representation of your equation. 
That’s where graphs come in. They let you look at an equation, instead of just 
reading it. You can see where important points are on the graph, like when 
you’ll run out of money, or how long it will take you to save up for that new car. 
In fact, with graphs, you can make smart decisions with your equations.

general equations rock
Using the information that Ed has given you, 
figure out the general equation for his income 
over the next weeks and months. 
Solution
Ed’s cash = all lawns in a week times cost per lawn times weeks
This is how much Ed has made over 
some length of time, call it “C.”
This is what changes, we’ll 
call it “t” (for time).
C = (712)t
C = 84t
Now Ed can know what his cash is at ANY time
The general equation that you’ve written can work in two different ways 
because you have two variables. If Ed has a time when he wants to know 
how much money he’ll have, you just substitute that time for t, and solve 
for C. Or,  if Ed knows how much money he wants, you can tell him 
when he’ll get there by substituting the amount in for C and solving for t. 
So when can I get 
that hedge trimmer?
Substitute for C, solve for t. 
Just substitute the value of the hedge 
trimmer in for C and solve for t.

Why don’t you just SHOW me the money?
What if we could come up with a way where we could look up a value, like the 
amount an accessory costs, and then see what t was for that amount? In fact, there 
is a way to show all the possible “what if’s” that you can have for an equation. A 
graph allows you to draw all of the possible points for an equation and then look 
up different points as you need them.
Then you can see how much money Ed will have at any given time and tell him 
if he can afford something, without having to solve that same equation again and 
again. Let’s start by taking the information we know and drawing it on a grid:

you draw a line that connects all of those dots, you’ll be able to use it

Graphs show an ENTIRE relationship
Once we add the line to the picture of the points that we’ve figured out, it turns out we’ve drawn a 
graph of the relationship between C (Ed’s cash) and t (the number of weeks he’s been cutting grass):
There’s something else that covers the entire relationship
We also have an equation that covers the entire relationship between C and t: 
C = 84t
It turns out that what we have—the graph with the line and everything—is 
actually a graph of the equation. It shows us the equation and lets us look at 
how C and t are related. 
On top of that, this graph shows a trend for the equation: the general direction 
that the relationship is heading. Ed’s graph is trending upward. That means he’s 
going to have made more money as time goes on (meaning he’ll keep moving 
lawns, save more cash, and so on). 
Now, when Ed wants to buy something, he can just look up the value for C he 
wants. Let’s see exactly how that works...

Q: Is the graph of the equation the line 
or the points?
A: Both. A line is made up of an infinite 
number of points. So the points that we 
computed for Ed were just a few from the 
relationship. Once we draw a line, that’s the 
graph of the entire equation. 
Equations and graphs both demonstrate 
a relationship between variables. In this 
case, the variables are C and t. Graphs and 
equations are just different ways of showing 
the same thing. 
Q: How do I know where to plot my 
points if they don’t fall on an exact line 
on the grid?
A: Don’t stress! Just look at the numbers 
on the axis (that’s the line at the edge of 
the graph that tells you what numbers go 
on what grid line) and estimate where your 
point should go. As long as you’re consistent 
about being close, the graph will be good 
enough to use. 
Another thing to think about is that graphs 
won’t always be as big as Ed’s is. He’s 
thinking pretty long term. If you’ve got a 
graph that you can work with just between 
0 and 10, for example, it’s going to be much 
easier to be exact with that smaller range of 
numbers. 
Q: What’s is exactly is a trend again?
A: A trend is just the general direction 
of a line. If a graph is heading upward, that 
means that as one variable increases, so 
does the other. And if the line is heading 
downhill, as one variable increases, the 
other variable decreases.
Q: How do I know which number to 
plot using the bottom axis, and which 
number to plot with the side axis?
A: Usually, each axis on your graph is 
labeled, like “time” or “number of weeks” or 
“Ed’s cash.” Once you see that, you’ll be able 
to plot each value along the right axis line.  
 
If not, you should label them! If your 
equation is in terms of x and y, then the x is 
horizontal and the y is vertical. In the case 
where your variables are different, hang 
on—you’ll be learning how to identify the 
structure of a linear equation, and then you’ll 
be able to see which variable is acting like 
the x and is horizontal. 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: Can a graph show any variables?
A: Just like with equations, you can 
use any variable you want. x and y are the 
most common, with x typically being on the 
horizontal axis, and y on the vertical axis, 
but you can use anything you like.
Q: Do we have to figure out the points 
first every time? Or can we just draw the 
line right away somehow?
A: You don’t have to always plot points 
first. We’re going to learn some methods 
that you can use that don’t require ANY 
computations at all. Then, you’ll be able 
to graph an equation by just looking at the 
equation. But you’re going to need some

Ed needs to subcontract.
Ed can’t afford to lose all of his customers

We need to expand the graph to read 
that last value, right? If the C values went 
lower, that would work... but he’s in debt, 
so C will be less than zero.
The Cartesian Plane allows values to go BELOW zero
Lots of graphs need to show negative numbers. The math standard for a 
graph is called the Cartesian Plane. Using the Cartesian Plane, both 
of the axis values can go negative, which means your values can also be 
negative, or less than zero.

the cartesian plane
Let’s graph Ed’s equation on the Cartesian Plane
Just because we started with a smaller portion of the plane for Ed’s graph doesn’t mean 
we need to stay there. If we put Ed’s graph on the Cartesian Plane, we’ll be able to read 
off the value we need and figure out how far Ed is going to go into debt. 
When we first started with Ed’s graphs, we just made up a grid and plotted the points 
we knew. Each point was actually an ordered pair: one number followed by another 
number. We write those like this: (0, 252). The first number is the horizontal number, 
the second is for the vertical, and the parentheses say the numbers are connected. So 
each point for Ed’s graph is (t, C), where t is time, and C is Ed’s cash:
Ed’s graph has two INTERCEPT points
A linear equation is an equation that expresses a relationship between two 
variables—like the relationship between Ed’s cash and time. The line that 
represents a linear equation has points where it crosses the x-axis and y-axis, 
called intercepts. 
Where C = 0 is the t-intercept, which is where the line crosses the t-axis. And 
where t = 0 is the value for the C-intercept, where the line crosses the C axis. 
These intercepts are usually called x- or y-intercepts because x and y are the 
standard labels for the horizontal and vertical axis lines.

Hey, how can you just extend the 
lines into those other quadrants? We 
don’t have any points to plot over there.
Plot two points that satisfy your equation.
1
Draw a straight line through (and past) your two points.
Lines go on forever in both directions, so the line you draw has to go 
past both of your plotted points.
2
Add arrows on both ends of the line.
The arrows indicate that the line goes past the part of the equation 
represented on your graph.
3
Lines go on forever.
After you’ve figured out any two points for an equation, you can draw a 
line through those points, and you’ve graphed your linear equation. But 
lines don’t just stop. If nothing changes, they’ll go on forever—to infinity.
It makes sense that two points make a line, but why? Because to be a 
specific line, you need a point and a direction. If you plot just one point, 
you can draw lines in all different directions that go through that point. 
Once you’ve picked a second point, you know which direction that line 
has to go to hit both of them.  
 
To graph a straight line:
The truth about linear equations...
A linear equation is an equation that defines a line. That means any equation 
of this type, when you graph it, will produce a line. You can identify a linear 
equation by looking at it: if it has one or two variables, those variables have an 
exponent of 1, and all of the terms are constants or constants multiplied by 
variables, it’s a linear equation.
Once you have looked at an equation and determined that it’s linear, plot two 
points and draw your line. Start by setting one variable to 0, and solve for the 
other variable. Then flip the variables: assign the second one to zero, and solve 
for the first. This will give you your two intercepts. Then you can draw a line 
through the intercepts, and you’ve got your graph! 
C = 252 - 49t
Ed’s equation is linear:
The terms are all either 
one of the two variables 
multiplied by a constant 
or just a constant

bullet points and questions
Q: Why are intercepts such a big deal?
A: Because they are one of those 
things that makes life easier. Ever noticed 
that when you throw a zero into the mix, 
equations seem to get easier? Since the 
x- and y- intercepts both allow you to set one 
coordinate in an equation to zero, they make 
finding a point to plot pretty easy.
Q: I’ve heard of a table of values, what 
is that all about?
A: A table of values is a more formal way 
of solving an equation to get points to use 
on a graph. Typically, you set up a table with 
columns for the x value, the y value, and the 
equation. You plug in values for x and solve 
for y, and then vice versa. In fact, that’s a lot 
like we did with Ed... just a little more formal. 
The big difference between using a table of 
values and solving just for the intercepts is 
speed. You’re only solving for two, easy-to-
find points with intercepts, and that’s usually 
pretty quick to do.
Q: What about equations with more 
than two variables?
A: That’s a 3D graph, and we won’t be 
doing any of that! You don’t need to worry 
about those types of graphs in Algebra.
Q: Is there a way to check my graph?
A: Yes. The easiest way is to solve for 
another point and make sure that it’s on 
your line. For our example, if you substitute 
x = -1 and solve for y, the y-value you come 
up with should be on your line. If it’s not, 
something’s wrong.
Q: Why is that grid called the 
Cartesian Plane?
A: This standard form of a grid was 
created by a guy named Rene Descartes in 
1637 as part of his work to merge Algebra 
and Geometry. It works perfectly since we’re 
going to be creating shapes (like lines) that 
can be described by Algebraic equations.
Q: Why are the quadrants written in 
roman numerals?
A: That’s just the standard way all 
mathematicians talk about graphs—using 
roman numerals.
Q: Is there a standard variable for 
each axis?
A: Yes, typically x is the horizontal axis, 
and y is the vertical. That doesn’t mean they 
have to be, though. Ed’s equation used C 
and t, and that was okay, too. 
The Cartesian Plane just shows a 
relationship between two variables. You 
can either swap out the variables in your 
equation for x and y, or you can re-label 
each axis in the graph.

The typical variables for a graph are 
x for the horizontal axis, and y for the 
vertical axis. 
x

-intercept is the point where the 
graph crosses the x-axis (x, 0).
To solve for the

 x-intercept, set y = 0 
and solve for x.
The 

y-intercept is the point where the 
graph crosses the y-axis, (0, y).
To solve for the

y-intercept, set x = 0 
and solve for y.

These slopes are just 
lines on a graph, right? So 
don’t those lines represent 
equations, too?
An equation can take several different 
forms... and you can use the form that 
helps you out the most.
When linear equations are written a certain way, they 
have a particular form. The form is just the order of 
the variables, numbers, and operations. Sometimes 
a form has two points, and sometimes it has an 
intercept and a slope.
But no matter what form of a linear equation you’re 
looking at, every line has a slope, intercepts, 
no exponents greater than one, and two 
variables. Understanding the forms just means 
knowing how to interpret the equations and write 
them in different ways.
A line on a graph always 
represents an equation.
In fact, if you know one point on a line 
and the slope of a line, you can write out 
the equation for that line.
How can that be?

Linear equations in point-slope form
The point-slope form of a linear equation represents an 
equation as a point on the line and the slope of the line. So as

use the point-slope form:

These terms probably look a little weird and are a little confusing. Are they 
variables or constants? And what are those little numbers?
Subscripts
Here’s the deal. The little 1’s below and to the side are called subscripts. They indicate 
a specific value of x and y, and since the subscripts are the same, they indicate that those 
x and y values go together. So here’s an ordered pair:
,
x y
1

_
i
This pair represents a point somewhere along the line. It can be an intercept, but it doesn’t 
have to be. With any single point you can still write the equation.
Since they’re a point on a graph, they are also constants, not variables. So in the point-slope 
form, you’re taking an ordered pair that represents a point on the line and splitting the two 
numbers of that pair up in the equation.

two points for his lawns, so we could pick 
whichever one we want to use for the point-
slope form of an equation.
Q: This slope thing seems a little fuzzy. 
“Downhill,” “rise,” “run”... are these really 
math words?
A: Sure. Just because it’s Algebra doesn’t 
mean it’s complicated and weird. These 
concepts can be much easier to learn with 
more basic terms. Saying that a negative 
slope is downhill just makes sense, right?
Q: Why is the slope so important?
A: Every line is defined by some type 
of slope. If you have a negative slope or a 
positive slope, you’ll know if  y goes up or 
down with x. 
That translates into whatever two variables 
you’re working with. For example, Edward 
saves more money (C) as time (t) goes on. 
So that equation has a positive slope.
Q: Do we need to memorize the form 
of the point-slope equation? 
 
A: Yeah. It’s pretty easy to do, though. 
The slope-intercept equation comes from the 
definition of slope.

The trickiest part of this equation is that positive x1 and y1 values 
are subtracted. That means if you see addition signs in the point-
slope equation, you’re dealing with a negative coordinate value, 
not a positive one.

The same holds true for any line for which you know a point and the slope. Just start with the 
general point-slope equation, and substitute the values for m and x1 and y1 , and you have a 
valid equation for the line.
Watch the signs! If you have a negative value for either x1 or y1, put it in the equation with the 
negative and then simplify. You’ll end up with an added value in the equation for the line.

So now what do we 
do? With a 0 slope, 
everything’s messed up.
Horizontal lines require a different form
Ed is looking at a nice, flat lawn. The rise of the line is 0, so 
it doesn’t matter what the run is because the slope will still 
come out to be zero.
Writing an equation that describes a horizontal line like this 
is actually pretty simple. Since all of the y values are the 
same (2 in this case), you can just write:
The slope of a horizontal 
line is always 0.
y =    
With a slope of 0, things get weird.
There are cases where the point-slope form won’t 
quite describe the line, like when a line has a slope 
of 0. 
That last lawn is definitely a straight line. So how 
do we express an equation for that line? Well, we 
know that the equation will have to be in terms of 
x and/or y somehow, but what about slope? How 
does a zero‑slope work?
Answer: 2
So since the slope is zero, 
what happens to x? It can’t 
be zero, too, right?
Write in your y-values here.
There’s an x with a coefficient of 0.
If you have a coefficient of a variable that’s zero, the 
variable will disappear. This equation can be written as: 
y - 2 = 0x
It still doesn’t really look quite right.  Good thing 
there’s another form that will work better...

standard form
Equations also have a standard form
There’s a form of a linear equation called the standard form. A 
horizontal line is a very specific case in which point-slope won’t 
work, but there’s a more general form. The standard form actually 
takes both y and x into account and works when the slope of a line 
is zero:
ax
by
c
+
=
Can you figure out what a and 
b would be for a line where the 
equation is y = 2.
a, b, and c are numbers in 
an equation for a line.
In this form, there’s no m. That means none of those variables 
mean slope. And a, b, and c do not stand for anything relating 
to a graph, either. So this form isn’t quite so easy to turn into a 
graph. But that’s okay because this equation handles every type 
of line, no matter what.
So, if we set a = 0, b = 1 and 
c = 2, we have the equation 
for Ed’s flat lawn, right?
That’s right!
Any other form of a linear equation can 
be turned into the standard form. So 
we can turn the earlier equation, y = 2, 
into the ax + by = c form.
That’s 0X + 1y = 2

Are there any 
other forms we need 
to know about?
There’s one more form... and this 
form IS great for graphing.
The last equation form that’s left is similar to 
point-slope in what it contains. This last form 
comes with a point and a slope within the 
equation. 
This form includes the y-intercept, so it’s called 
the slope-intercept form.
The slope-intercept form is EASY to graph
Not only that, but slope-intercept comes with the same constant for slope, 
m. So m is the slope, just like it was earlier. On top of that, x and y are still 
variables, like all the other forms of linear equations. The intercept is the part 
that’s different. Here’s what this format looks like:
Slope intercept equation - A linear equation of the 
form y = mx + b where m is the slope of the line 
and b is the coordinate for the y term of the 
y-intercept.
y
mx
b
=
+
m = slope, like always.
This is the same slope 
we’ve been talking about 
rise over run.
(0, b) is the y-intercept. So b is 
where a line crosses the y-axis.
To draw this line, just plot the y-intercept at (0, b) and then find your 
second point using the slope, m, just like you did before.

This form has a lot going for it. It gives you a quick point to plot, and it gives you a

works for all lines, and it’s an easy equation to manipulate.
Graphing is tough with standard form because you don’t 
have a slope or a point to start with. The only way to 
graph this form is to solve for a couple of points and then 
plot those points and draw a line.

This form gives you the y-intercept, and it gives you a slope so you can plot the rest of the line. 
Slope-intercept is a good middle ground. It’s easy to manipulate, and it gives you a point right 
away. However, if the y-intercept for the graph is really high or really low, it can make graphing 
the line really tough.
Slope-intercept is great for

You’re ready to graph some equations. Here are several equations 
in different forms... draw a visual representation of each one.
This is a point slope equation.

Start at (1, -2)
Go down 1 and 
to the right 2
This is a slope-intercept equation.
This is the y-intercept 
coordinate, (0, -2). 
This is the slope. 
Rise is 3, run is 1.
y = 3x - 2
Start here, with the 
intercept (0, -2).
“Rise” 3 
and “run” 1
This is in standard form.
All of the 
points have 
7 as their x 
value. This is 
a vertical line.
Just by remembering that 
the 0 makes y go away, you 
can see that this is x = 7
x = 7
This means the y value for 
your point is -2. Since the 
form subtracts the point, 
-(-2) becomes +2.
The point you get out 
of this is (1, -2) so 
plot that first.

Q: Why does m stand for slope?
A: Nobody really knows. Descartes (Mr. Cartesian Plane 
himself) didn’t use it. There are ideas about “modulus” or 
maybe it’s just because it’s a letter in the middle of the alphabet. 
At this point, it’s just what everyone else uses.
Q: Why do we use “b” for the y-intercept?
A: Well, that’s another mystery, like slope. In modern day 
math, several other countries use different letters for the 
y-intercept, like k, n, or h.
Q: If x and y are on the same side of the equation, can 
the equation still be in slope-intercept form?
A: Sure, but you’ll have to manipulate the equation to get it 
in the form y = mx +b. The signs can be different, but that just 
means that the constant is a negative number.
Q: Why are m and b constants but x and y variables? 
How can you tell when a letter is a variable and not a 
constant?
A: The constants are what will appear as numbers in 
a typical situation. When you learn a standard form of an 
equation (like slope-intercept), you know now that m and b are 
constants because they’ll always be the same in the equation.  
And here’s another clue when looking at a new equation: the 
coordinate plane is based on x and y, making them variables. x 
can take on all sorts of values, just like y, but m and b stay the 
same.
Q: If m is a whole number, then what’s the “run” of “rise 
over run”?
A: Think back to your fractions! Any whole number is the 
same as a fraction with the whole number in the numerator and 
one in the denominator. So, if you have a slope of 5, then it’s 
the same thing as 5 over 1, or, “rise 5, run 1.”
Q: You keep saying that “form” is what’s important. What 
does that really mean?
A: The form of the equation is just the arrangement of 
variables and constants. For example, in a point-slope equation, 
you have to have the y isolated on one side of the equation and 
an x term on the right for it to be in point-slope form.
Q: What if I have an equation like y = x? Is that in any 
special form?
A: Yes. y = x is exactly the same as 
y=1x + 0, which is slope-intercept form. So here, m = 1, and 
b = 0. And since you have an m and a b, you’re ready to plot 
your graph.
Q: When would you start with a graph and need to write 
the equation?
A: It happens a lot, actually. When you have a plot of actual 
data—financial data or experimental data—and you need to 
write a line to generalize what’s happening, you’ll have a graph 
before you have an equation.
Q: You can really just figure out the slope and the 
intercept and write an equation?
A: That’s the beauty of having standard forms. Everybody 
knows that the coefficient for the x term is the slope, and the 
constant that’s added onto the equation is the y-coordinate of 
the y-intercept.
If your slope is a whole 
number, the RUN of the 
slope is that number, and 
the RISE of the slope is 1.

the future looks bright
Your job was to figure out how much Ed is going to make by the end of the summer, and draw 
him a graph to show his cash projections for the next 22 weeks (that’s how long his plan runs). 
Week #

15-16
Different rates: 8 
at $12 each, 1 at $15, 
and 1 at $20
$131 per week at 
2 weeks = $ 262
Different rates - 
all of the  lawns 
from 15 - 16 plus 2 
more at $ 15
$131 + $30 per week 
= $ 161 per week
$ 252

$84 per week for 3 
weeks = $252

$12 per lawn, but it 
cost him $19 per lawn 
= - $7 per week
 -$49 per week for 
10 weeks = - $ 490
$ 238
$24

Cash = $161 a week times weeks +  $ 12 he starts with
C = 161t + 12
This is in the y = mx + b form - easy to plot!
Don’t forget about the 
money Ed started with.
This is a lot like Ed’s early equation, 
but he’s now making more money a week.
The y - intercept is (0, 12)

$1000! Even after the broken leg - that’s awesome. I’m 
going to take the graph you made and make some plans!
A picture might also be worth 1,000 bucks!
Sometimes an equation has a lot to say about the future. In 
fact, an equation can tell Ed how much to save, how many 
yards to mow, even how a particular yard will profit his 
business.
But sometimes you need more than a bunch of numbers 
and letters. In those cases, a graph can help you see your 
equation... and make informed decisions.
C = 161t + 12

The slope is 161, so go 
up 161 and over 1.

Can’t quite get enough?
Oh, the inequality of it 
all... I should have been enough, 
but I came up just short.
Sometimes enough is enough... and sometimes it’s not. 
Have you ever thought, “I just need a little bit more”? But what if someone gave 
you more than just a bit more? Then you’d have more than you need...but life 
might still be pretty good. In this chapter, you’ll see how Algebra lets you say, 
“Give me a little more... and then some!” With inequalities, you’ll go beyond two 
values and allow yourself to get more, or less.

Kathleen really loves football
Kathleen wants to start her own fantasy football team but needs 
your help managing it. Each team is limited to spending no 
more than $1,000,000 on player salaries. Your job is to help 
Kathleen put together a balanced team. 
Each team can spend $1,000,000, but I 
need to spread that out over my defense, 
some offensive players, and a quarterback.
As manager of Kathleen’s 
team, you’ve got to 
figure out how much to 
spend on each position.
For defense, you 
get to buy a whole 
team as a unit, not 
just single players.

Using the team price equation below, can you come up with a team 
that works? If not, why? Is there a problem with our equation?
The problem with using an equals sign is that there isn’t a combination of players that will equal exactly 
$1,000,000.. We don’t need exactly $1,000,000; the team just can’t cost any more than that.
You’re really working with a comparison...

WORDS. You’ll 
see them all the 
time in word 
problems.
We aren’t looking for equality here. The cost of the entire team 
just needs to be less than or equal to $1,000,000. What 
we need is a way to show that the cost can be less than that 
amount, just not more than it.
When you have a comparison, you use something different 
than an equals sign. For that, use a comparison symbol like 
less than (<) or greater than (>).
Means “less than or equal to.”
So the < sign compares one side 
of the equation to the other, right?
The <, >, ≤ and ≥ symbols are comparisons.  
The first one, <, means the thing on the left is less than the 
thing on the right. The next one, >, means the thing on 
the left is greater than the thing on the right. The last two 
are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to, respectively. 
Statements using these comparison symbols are called 
inequalities since it’s about two things not being equal.

inequalities
Inequalities Up Close
The = sign means “equal to,” and you already know how it works. It 
means both sides of an equation are the same:
The equals sign says 
everything on this side...
...is equal to this side.
With Kathleen’s problem, we’re dealing with inequalities. That means that 
the two sides aren’t equal, but there is still a relationship. An inequality can 
be written with one of four symbols. They all express a different relationship: 
greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to. They 
will appear in an equation exactly where you would expect to see an equals sign:
Everything on 
this side...
is less than...
this side.

Inequalities are COMPARISONS
The inequality symbols provide a way to compare two numbers, or two 
sets of numbers. Let’s take a look a the number line, which is a great way 
to see the relationships between numbers. Numbers are smaller as you go 
to the left of the line, and they get bigger on the right.

1 is left of 3, so 1 is less 
than (<) 3.
Positive two

than
negative three.
The number to the left on the 
number line is always the smallest.
2 is to the right of -3 on the number line, so 
2 is greater than -3.
Below are some inequalities. Some are correct, some aren’t. Write 
whether each inequality is true or false.

Write an inequality using the money Kathleen has already spent 
and figure out what’s the most she could spend on her quarterback.
The big difference between an inequality and an 
equality is the MEANING of your ANSWER.  
The solution to the equation means Kathleen can spend at most $103,000 
on a quarterback. But that doesn’t mean she has to spend exactly that 
amount. If there was a quarterback for $94,000, Kathleen could spend 
that, and her equation would be true ($94,000 ≤ $103,000). 
Reading the solution of an inequality is the easiest way to make sense of 
it. For instance, “q is less than or equal to 103,000.” With inequalities, a 
range of answers work. The answers that work with an inequality are 
called the solution set. 
Defensive Team + Running Back + Wide Receiver + Kicker + Quarterback ≤ 1,000,000
333,000 + 197,000 + 212,000 + 155,000 + q ≤ 1,000,000
897,000 + q ≤ 1,000,000
-897,000 + 897,000 + q ≤ 1,000,000 - 897,000
q ≤ 103,000
I’m just not getting it. We did exactly the 
same math as if it had been an equals sign. Why 
are we going through this inequality stuff?
A solution set is all of the values 
that satisfy an expression. In 
Kathleen’s case, it’s any number less 
than or equal to 103,000.
why inequalities matter
Let q be how much 
Kathleen can spend on 
her quarterback.

inequalities
Q: Why do we need inequalities?
A: An inequality is a lot more realistic 
in many situations. If you only need to find 
out if you have enough gas, any amount of 
gas over what you need is fine. So that’s an 
inequality. 
For Kathleen, there are a bunch of different 
ways she can spend $1,000,000, and they 
all work...even if none of them add up to 
exactly 1,000,000.
Q:What’s the difference between “less 
than” and “less than or equal to”?
A: ”Less than” means that the solution set 
includes everything up to (but not including) 
the value on the other side of the inequality. 
That includes decimals and fractions, too. 
So, if you have x < 6, x can be any number 
below 6. For example, 5.99999999999 is 
okay, but not 6 itself. 
If you change the expression to x ≤ 6, then 
6 is an answer that works.
Q: Same deal with “‘greater than” and 
“greater than or equal to”?
A: Yes, except the answers are higher.  
So if the inequality is x > 6, the solution set 
is above 6, for example, 6.000000001. 
Q: We performed inverse operations 
around an inequality sign. So do 
inequality signs always work just like an 
equals sign?
A: Well, not always. We’ll get into more 
detail later, but as long as you’re only doing 
addition and subtraction, the inequality 
behaves just as an equality.
Q: What do you mean, not always?
A: With multiplication and division of 
negative integers, things can get interesting. 
In those cases, the inequality sign can 
change. We’ll talk more about that in just a 
few pages.
Q: Does this inequality thing really 
help? I mean, having a whole mess of 
answers doesn’t seem very exact.
A: It’s not. What is important to 
understand is that when you’re dealing with 
many real-world situations, you don’t need a 
single number. You actually need to know all 
the numbers that would work. 
Algebra is able to deal with many more 
complex situations than traditional arithmetic, 
and this is one of them. Part of Algebra is 
manipulating expressions to figure out the 
solution, but you also have to check that 
your solution actually makes sense.
Q: When do you use a number line?
A: Any time you feel like you’re not quite 
sure about a comparison or how to analyze 
your answer. We’ll revisit number lines later 
in the chapter as a way to show the entire 
solution set.
Q: An equation usually has a set 
number of solutions, right? How many 
solutions do inequalities have?
A: Inequalities have an infinite number 
of solutions. You’re trying to find the 
boundaries: the highest or lowest values 
that are allowed. Once you know that, you 
can solve your problem. And remember, just 
because there might be an infinite number of 
mathematically correct solutions, it doesn’t 
always mean all those values make sense in 
the real world. 
For example, there are infinite numbers 
between $102,999.999 and $103,000.00, 
but they probably don’t make a whole lot of 
a difference to Kathleen. Since she’s talking 
about money, $102,999.999 is basically the 
same as $103,000.00 for her problem.
Q: With equality, it means the same 
thing on both sides. What does inequality 
mean? Not the same?
A: Generally, yes. By reading the 
inequality symbol that is used in the 
expression, you can figure out exactly what 
the relationship is between two sides.
Q: What about that ≠ sign that 
I’ve seen in math books? Is that an 
inequality? 
A: It means “not equal to.” Like: 
  	
4 ≠ 6 
 
As symbols go, it’s not very descriptive. It is 
an inequality symbol, though.

Inequalities involving some negative number 
operations need special treatment
Kathleen still needs a good quarterback, but there’s another way she can stack 
the deck in her favor. The fantasy football league she’s in allows you to handicap 
another team by buying “penalty points” before a game. For every penalty point she 
buys, the opposing team loses ten yards of offense when they play her team.
I’m playing my brother’s team next, 
so I want a safety net for the upcoming game. I 
want at least 50 yards off my opponent.
Since Kathleen said she wants at least 50 yards, we’ve got 
an inequality. We can let g be the number of penalty points 
Kathleen needs to buy, and we have this inequality:
Take a close look at this. For every pentalty point (g), the 
opposing team loses 10 yards (-10). And Kathleen wants her 
brother to start out at -50 yards.
To solve this, we need to  divide both sides by -10:
What could Kathleen 
have said to make this 
an equality instead?
There is so much wrong here; I don’t even know 
where to start. Why is -10g less than or equal to -50 
when Kathleen said “at least”? Then, you get g ≤ 5? That 
works for g = 5, but anything less than that, and it’s 
completely wrong! If g is 4, then we end up with -40. And 
that’s less than or equal to -50?
This can’t be 
right... we must have 
something wrong here.
Inequalities with negative numbers need 
some SPECIAL RULES.  
Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on.

First let’s deal with the “at least” part of the problem. Kathleen wants at least 50 yards 
taken off of her opponent’s offense. 51 yards, 52 yards, 60 yards... those all work. But 
40 yards is not enough. Since these are actually negative yards for the opponent, that 
means -50 yards works, -60 yards works, but -40 yards doesn’t:
Since numbers on the left of the number line are less than numbers on 
the right, the expression we’re trying to solve has to be less than -50. So 
what we end up with is this:
Whatever the left side of our inequality comes out to be, it has to be less 
than or equal to -50.
Multiplication and division of negative numbers 
causes problems for inequalities
So now we need to figure out what went wrong at the end when we 
solved for g. The reason that the inequality doesn’t work with negative 
numbers is simple: negative numbers are backward. For example, -10 is 
actually less than -2, exactly the opposite of the positive numbers 10 and 2.
One million is a 
really BIG number
But, since it’s 
negative, it’s way 
less than zero, and 
it’s value is small.
Ten is not a very 
big number...
...but it’s also pretty 
close to zero, so it’s 
value is bigger.
The end result of all of this is that when you multiply or divide by a 
negative number, the relationship expressed with the inequality is reversed. 
That’s because you’re changing the direction of the relationship of the 
numbers to zero.
So, how do you handle that? 
If you multiply 
or divide by a 
negative number 
the inequality 
becomes backwards.
We know 50 yards works...
... but so do -60, -70, etc.

FLIP the inequality sign with negative 
multiplication and division
Since the value of negative numbers is the opposite of the size 
of the number, negative numbers reverse the relationship of the 
inequality. For an example, let’s multiply both sides by -2.

18 is a big number, 
but, now it’s negative, 
a lesser value.
Now the one is 
positive two - 
a bigger value.
The inequality started with a larger number on the left and ended 
with a larger number on the right—the opposite relationship. The 
solution to how to work with this is easy. When you multiple or divide 
by a negative number, flip your inequality sign..

inequalities
When you’re working with an inequality 
and negative multiplication or division...
Start with a valid inequality.
The inequality can contain numbers or unknowns, and it just needs to 
be true (and if you can check it with a number line, that’s good too).
1
Multiply or divide both sides by a NEGATIVE number.
If you need to multiply or divide by a negative number, be sure and do 
that to both sides of your equation. But you’re not done. Anytime you 
multiply or divide by a negative, you’ve got to immediately...
3
Flip the inequality symbol in the equation.
Do this right away! Greater-than becomes less-than, less-than-or-equal 
becomes greather-than-or-equal, and so forth. And you have to do this 
every time you multiply or divide by a negative number.
4
Negative 
numbers get 
LARGER in 
value as they 
get CLOSER 
to zero.
It’s easy to visualize the location of your numbers on a number line and figure out how 
the inequality relationship changes. The inequality sign is just a way to keep track of the 
relationship in your equation. Your job is to work with your equation and the inquality sign 
in a way that preserves a correct relationship.
So, all you have to do is reverse the inequality when you multiply or divide by negative 
numbers. You’re not changing the expression... you’re actually preserving the expression.
Work with the equality just like an equation, as long 
as you don’t need to multiply or divide by a NEGATIVE 
number.

214    Chapter 6
Q: How can we just flip the inequality? 
Isn’t that changing everything?
A: Actually, flipping the inequality is how 
you keep things the same. If you remember 
the number line,when you multiply or divide 
by a negative number, you change the 
relationship between the two sides of the 
equation. 
The inequality symbol is just keeping track 
of which side is worth more. A high negative 
number is worth much less than a low 
positive number (and visa versa).
Q: How do you flip a ≤ ?
A: If your inequality has an “equal to” 
component, you replace it with the opposite 
“equal to” inequality. So, “less than or equal 
to” flipped is “greater than or equal to.”
Q: Can you tell me again exactly what 
a solution set is?
A: The solution set for an inequality 
contains ALL of the numbers that make your 
inequality true.
Q: Will I ever have to flip an inequality 
sign more than once?
A: Possibly. If the inequality is written 
in such a way that you have to multiply or 
divide both with a negative number more 
than once, you’ll flip your sign more than 
once. Just flip your sign every time you do 
the negative multiplication or division, and 
you’ll be okay. 
It’s just like when you solve equations; if you 
apply all the rules correctly, you’ll get the 
right answer every time.
Q: What if I need to multiply or divide 
by a fraction, or a decimal. Do I need to 
flip my inequality sign then?
A: Only if it’s a negative decimal or 
fraction. It doesn’t matter what form the 
negative number comes in; if it’s negative, 
you’ll need to flip the inequality sign.
Q: What if I add or subtract a negative 
number?
A: There’s no flipping required. That’s 
because you’re preserving the direction 
things are going. If you add a negative 
number to both sides, both sides of the 
inequality will be moving to the left on the 
number line at the same rate. That means 
the sides of the equation have the same 
relationship to each other. 
Remember, it’s all about the relative 
relationship of the sides. If that doesn’t 
change, then there’s no reason to change 
anything. 
Q: What if we’re just simplifying an 
inequality by multiplying or dividing 
one side of an inequality by a negative 
number? Something like (-3)(2) > -10?
A:In that case, since you’re not moving a 
negative number across the inequality, you 
don’t change the sign. So, if you work the 
example, you get -6 > -10, which is correct.

Now that you can handle negative inequalities, you can solve 
Kathleen’s penalty points problem correctly. Here are a few other 
inequalities to try out, too.  Use the number line at the bottom to 
check your work.
“I’m playing my brother’s team next, so I want a safety net for the 
upcoming game. I want at least 50 yards off my opponent.” Figure out 
how many penalty points Kathleen needs to buy.
The league gives 40 points for each game you win, and you have to have more than 
260 points to get the Heisman Trophy at the end of the season. How many games 
does Kathleen need to win for her Quarterback to get the Heisman?
League rules say if you have more than 10 penalties in the season, your team is disqualified. 
Kathleen wants to make sure she spaces penalties out evenly over her 16 games. What’s the 
maximum number of penalties she can get per game and not get disqualified?

Now that you can handle negative inequalities, you can solve 
Kathleen’s penalty points problem correctly. Here are a few other 
inequalities to try out, too.  Use the number line at the bottom to 
check your work.
-10g ≤-50
-10g ?-50
   g ≥ 5
-10   -10
Kathleen needs to buy 5 or more penalty points.
40w > 260
40w > 260
   w > 6.5
40     40
Kathleen needs to win more than 6.5 games, but since you can’t win half a game, she needs to win 7 or more games.
16p ≤10
16p ≤10
  p ≤ 0.625
16   16
The mathematical answer is less than or equal to 0.625 penalties per game, but since you can’t get 
part of a penalty, she can’t space her penalties evenly over all of the game. She’ll have to decide 
which games she needs to play dirty in and which ones she’ll need to be on good behavior for.

Don’t forget to flip 
the sign when you 
divide by -10.

You can visualize a solution set on a number line
The number line is a great way to visualize a solution set. You’ve been using 
number lines to show points, but how about a range of points or an 
entire solution set? That would help us pick numbers to check our work 
and also help to understand what numbers will satisfy an inequality.
Here’s what we need to do:
103, 000
q #
This is Kathleen’s 
quarterback’s salary equation.
103,000
Determine the point of interest (in this case, 103,000). This is the known 
boundary point of your solution set. 
Look at the inequality symbol to decide what type of point to start with.
#

or
Draw a solid point.
This indicates that the 
soution set includes the 
boundary point.
Draw an arrow along the number line in the direction of solutions that work. 
That’s to the left on your number line for “less than” solutions and to the 
right on the number line for “greater than” solutions.
<

This indicates that the solution

All the numbers from the circle

220    Chapter 6
Q: Why bother with the number line?
A: The number line is useful as a tool to help you 
understand a solution set. If you are having trouble visualizing 
which numbers are included with your solution, try plotting your 
inequality on a number line. 
Here’s another way to think about the number line: a number 
line is really just a graph with a single axis. And your line is a 
plot of all the points that solve your equation on that axis.
Q: Isn’t all of this number line stuff a little juvenile?
A: Absolutely not, especially if it helps you get your 
solutons. Anything that helps you to understand an inequality, 
a relationship, or a solution is valuable and should be used. 
Just because you learned about a tool when you were younger, 
doesn’t make that tool less useful now. 
Number lines, in particular, are extremely helpful when you’re 
trying to work with integers and inequalities. When you go back 
and forth around zero, it can be easy to lose track of which way 
you’re going!
Q: What do we do if there’s a big number and I can’t 
draw a line that goes up that high?
A: You need to be flexible with how big your spacing is on 
the number line. When we showed the quarterback’s salary on 
the previous page, the tick marks were 10,000 each. Until then, 
they’d been at 1 or 10 each. It just depends on your problem 
and the situation. You can always draw your solution; you just 
have to show your number line in the proper scale. 

Number lines are a great tool for 
checking work and visualizing 
solutions.

 for ≤ or ≥

 for < or >
Just indicate the direction of the 

range on the number line—you can’t 
draw them all!

You can change the SCALE 
on your number line without 
affecting the VALUES on that 
number line. Use whatever 
scale makes sense for YOUR

Let’s call this d.
So, what can I 
do with that? 
Subsitution?
Substitution is 
almost always a 
good idea. 
For example, suppose you 
find a quarterback you 
like who makes $185,000. 
You can substitute back 
into the inequality, and 
then you’ll always get 
another valid inequality 
that you can use for the 
defensive team, d.
Put 185,000 
in for q.

inequalities
Try graphing the inequality on the graph below.
Trial and error every time? That seems 
really inefficient. Is there another way?
Remember graphing? With equations, a graph gives you an entire line 
worth of solutions (if the equation has two variables). So graphing is 
actually a way to see the solutions to an equation.
Let’s try graphing a basic inequality. There are a couple of things to 
keep in mind:
When you graph an inequality, start with a line.
Just graph the inequality the way you would any other equation.
1
Figure out what range the inequality’s solutions fall in.
Is your answer above or below the line? This is similar to graphing with 
the number line: think about how your answer relates to your line.
2
Mark the side of the line your solutions are on.
You can used dashed lines, solid lines, shading... anything you want.

Use your y-intercept to

Using the slope, go up 3 and over 
one for your second point (1,5).
Since y is greater 
than the line 
equation, the area 
of greater y values 
is shaded.
Here’s the line
The line is dashed because it’s 
“greater than,” so it’s over, 
but not including the line.
The solution set is the 
ENTIRE shaded area.

inequalities
Use a graph to visualize the solutions to an inequality
Graphing inequalities in two variables is like graphing equations, with some extra shading. (Just 
like solving inequalities is like solving equations.) If you have an inequality, to graph the whole 
solution, you need to do the following:
Start with a valid inequality in two variables. The variable on the 
vertical axis (usually y) needs to be isolated.
1
Decide the format for the line:
2
Draw a solid line.
Draw a dashed line.
Draw the line the way you would an equality. Just make sure that it’s 
dashed or solid, depending upon your inequality.
3
Figure out if the shading should be above the line or below the line.

A dashed line (because

Shading shows potential answers
The ordered pairs in the shaded region satisfy the inequality. Every 
pair is a solution! The great thing about this is that it makes trial and 
error a thing of the past. If you decide you want x to be -1.5, you 
can use all the y values that are greater than the line and still satisfy 
the inequality.
Give it a try! If you substitute in both numbers, you should always 
get a valid inequality:
Try (-1.5, 3.2)
It’s plotted up 
on the graph, 
and it’s in the 
shaded area.

c + p = 5
So (5, 0) is a point.
c + 0 = 5
(0, 5) is another point.
So they’re (0, 5) and (5, 0)
If c = 0, then the punch is all pineapple juice, and if p = 0, then the punch is all cider. 
0 + p = 5
p = 0
c + p = 5
-p + c + p = 5 - p
c = 5 - p
c = -p + 5

This graph shows that as c goes up, p goes down.
So that means that the more cider that goes in, the less pineapple juice goes in. 
Not only that, but since the slope is -1, c and p go up or down at the same rate..
A line means infinite solutions
Since we have a line that shows the entire relationship between p

Zach is worried about how sparkling the punch is, not just what will

You can’t have -1 gallons of liquid!
If you’re working with a real-world problem, you have to keep in mind your 
problem’s context. The values for c and p can’t be less than zero because 
you can’t have less than zero gallons of punch.
So we know that some of the answers on our graph don’t work, but we still 
don’t know what mixture Zach should use. So what do we do now?
We have MANY

All Zach has is a bunch of 
ways to mix up cider and

than just 5 gallons of mix. He 
needs 5 gallons of mix, and 
he needs a 52% sparkling

something we’re missing...
Download at WoweBook.Com

246    Chapter 7
Your job was to come up with another equation, related to how 
sparkling Zach’s punch is. Here’s what we did:
Q: Where did those numbers before c 
and p come from?
A: We applied the same logic to c and p 
that we did for the total volume of punch. If 
you can multiply the total volume of punch by 
the percentage of sparkling (converted to a 
decimal), you can do the same thing for the 
other two liquids. 
100% sparkling cider = 1c 
40% sparkling pineapple juice = 0.4p
Q: How can you just “figure out” the 
amount of sparkling punch?
A: This problem of Zach’s is actually a 
classic mixture problem. Mixture problems 
like this are usually based on a proportion, in 
our case, how sparkling the punch will be. If 
52% of the total punch needs to be sparkling, 
then the amount of punch that is just 
sparkling is 2.6 gallons (52% of 5 gallons).
Q: Can I rewrite the equation in terms 
of x and y to make it easier?
A: Sure. Either you can have the equation 
and the graph in terms of x and y or in terms 
of c and p. It’s really up to you.
Q: How much do we need to worry 
about negative solutions?
A: For this problem, you don’t need to 
worry about negative solutions since you 
can’t have negative punch. 
We’ll look at how to express those types of 
limitations as part of an equation when we 
learn about functions in a few chapters.
Q: How can we work with these two 
equations together?
A: That’s what’s coming up next. But the 
volume equation has an infinite number of 
solutions, and the sparkling equation has an 
infinite number of solutions. There’s a way 
those solutions can work together...
two variables means two equations
The sparkling stuff is: 100% cider, 40% pineapple juice, and should create 52% punch.
To write an equation for this, 
figure out the amount of 
sparkling that would be in one 
mixture of punch. 
1c + 0.4p = 0.52(5)
c stands for the 
volume of cider.
p stands for the volume 
of pineapple juice.
This is the total 
volume of punch.
c + 0.4p = 2.6
This is our second equation
Cider is 100% (1.0).
The juice is 
40% (0.4).
We dropped the 1 from 1c.

systems of equations
c = The amount of sparkling cider, in gallons.
p = The amount of pineapple juice, in gallons.
52% carbonated

= 5 gallons x 0.52
=
2.6 gallons
If you’re hazy about how 
to work with decimals and 
percents - jump to the 
appendix and brush up.
This is how much pure 
sparkling liquid we need.
If you apply the same idea to the c and p variables, we’ve got a new equation. 
The sparkling cider is 100% sparkling, and the pineapple juice is 40% sparkling:
1c + (0.4)p = 2.6
This is the volume of 
cider that’s sparkling 
(all of it).
The volume of Pineapple 
juice that’s carbonated, 
just 40%
How does the sparkling equation work?
The problem Zach has with just the first equation is that there are an infinite number of 
ways to mix the ingredients together and get 5 gallons of punch. But none of those solutions 
specifically deal with his girlfriend’s request that the punch is 52% sparkling. 
By coming up with another equation that deals with the mixing, we can figure out which 
solutions create the right mix. This second equation will help because we’re using the same 
variables representing the same thing.
To develop the second equation, we took the second piece of information that we had 
about each variable—how sparkling each liquid is—and applied it to the variables to 
come up with a new problem:. 
Zach’s girlfriend gave 
him this number.
We’ve got another linear equation
This is another linear equation in terms of the same 
variables that we used in the first equation, c and p. 
This equation is in standard form, and you can work 
with it in exactly the same way.
What can we do with the 
second equation to help find a 
solution to the punch problem?

248    Chapter 7
Now we have TWO linear equations
So now we’ve got two equations with the same two variables. c is the 
volume of cider, and p is the volume of pineapple juice. Since both 
equations talk about the same thing, with the same variables, they can be 
looked at together:
5

p

0.4
2.6

=
We know that this is a linear equation - 
which means that all the points on the 
solution line solve this equation.
This is a linear equation, too. All the points on 
this equation’s line solve this problem.
One equation is in terms of total volume of punch, and the 
other is in terms of the sparkling volume of punch, but both 
equations are about volume. Each equation comes with 
an infinite number of ordered pairs that will solve the equation. 
Remember, solving an equation means coming up with values for 
the unknowns that will make that particular equation true. 
What we need, though, is a set of numbers that will solve both

The INTERSECTION of the lines solves

The point where the lines meet is the point where both equations 
have a solution. So for Zach’s punch problem, we need to find 
where the two lines meet. That’s the amount of liquid we want to 
make the perfect party punch.
Both equations individually have an infinite number of 
solutions.
Each line is an infinite set of ordered pairs that satisfy that 
particular equation and make the equation true.
 
The point where the lines intersect solves the problem.
The intersection is the solution because it solves both equations at 
the same time. The intersection is a point on both solution lines.
 
Check the solution point (4, 1) in both equations to see if it works.

Solve multiple unknowns with a  
SYSTEM of EQUATIONS
You’ve just solved a system of equations! A system of equations is a 
group of equations that can be treated as one problem. The solution is the 
point that satisfies all of the equations at the same time.
When it comes to a system of equations, though, you have to 
have two equations to find two unknowns. Why? Because if 
you only have one equation with two unknowns, you have a line that 
goes on forever. 
To know which point on the line to pick, you need more 
information. A second equation gives you a second line, and then 
you can find the intersection of the two lines to solve your system.
If you have two 
unknowns you need 
two independent 
relationships to 
find the values of 
the unknowns.

Q: Do we have to check our work?
A: Yes! Really, we’re going through this 
again? It takes like two seconds and then 
you know you got the right answer. Imagine, 
walking away from a problem knowing it’s 
completely right. 
It’s also good practice for manipulating the 
equation and substitution.
Q: Is graphing the only way to figure 
the answer out?
A: Stay tuned, there are more options 
coming up! The big advantage of graphing, 
though, is that it helps you see what could 
happen if something changed in your system.
Q: How did you know you can work 
with both equations together?
A: Well, it goes back to understanding the 
situation, not just manipulating equations. 
Algebra is a tool to solve a problem 
you’re dealing with, not the other way 
around. So when you’re working with 
equations, you need to always keep the 
context of your problem in mind. 
Zach was interested in a punch that was 
not only 5 gallons, but also had the perfect 
amount of sparkle. That means you need 
two equations, not just one.
Q: What if I only have one equation 
and two variables, can I get an answer?
A: Not without some kind of extra 
information. To figure out one unknown, you 
need one equation. To figure out two, you 
need two equations. To figure out three... 
well, you get the idea.
Q: What is a system of equations 
good for in real life?
A: Quite a lot, actually. Mixture problems 
(like we used here), supply and demand 
situations, area and perimeter, distance 
vs. time problems..... pretty much anything 
where you’ve got two related unknowns.
Q: If I have two equations with the 
same two variables, is there always a 
solution that solves both equations?
A: Not necessarily. Sometimes there isn’t 
an answer to the two specific equations. This 
means the lines never intersect.
More trouble... Zach dropped some glasses
When Zach and his girlfriend were setting up for the party, Zach broke a few 
glasses. The glasses were rented, so Zach’s got to pay to replace them. Now 
Zach’s trying to figure out how many more glasses he needs, and he can’t 
remember how many of each type he dropped. Here’s what he knows:
These tumblers cost 
$4 each to replace.
The wine glasses 
cost $6 to replace.
Kathleen said we 
paid $33 for broken 
glasses, and there were 7 
broken glasses.

Solve your system of equations using a graph
Graphing both equations is a way to find the values that satisfy 
both equations. We can graph the line that solves each equation, 
and then find the intersection point. Then we check our work 
in both equations, and Zach’s in and out of the glasses store in 
time to party.

You can substitute substitution 
for graphing
Sometimes graphing a system of equations just isn’t 
useful. The points of intersection aren’t falling along 
gridlines, for example. In those cases, you can use 
substitution to solve your system of equations instead.
To make substitution work, start with solving one 
equation for one variable.
7
x
y
+
=
We’ll solve this for 
x in terms of y.
-y + x + y = 7 - y
x = 7 - y
Now you’ve got a way to represent x in terms of y. 
So now, put that value for x into the other equation. 
That’s the substitution part:
4
6
33
x
y
+
=
4(7 - y) + 6y = 33
Once you have y, just put that value back into your 
first equation and solve for x.
Now we’ve got all 
y, and can solve 
this equation.
y = some number
x + y = 7
x + number = 7
x = 7 - number
The great thing about substitution is that you can get a 
fraction or a decimal answer, and it’s no big deal. With the 
graphing method, that doesn’t work well. 
The substitution method works because a system of equations 
is a set of equations with the same variables. If you can solve 
for one variable in terms of another variable, you can get a 
valid equation in terms of one variable.
The substitution 
method works 
because a system of 
equations is a set of

Using substitution, figure out how many of each type of glass Zach needs to replace.
Q:Is the substitution method better 
than the graphing method?
A: Better isn’t really the right word. 
Substitution has some advantages: you 
get an exact answer, and since you’re not 
estimating on a graph, it may be more exact. 
It has some disadvantages, too. There’s 
a lot of equation manipulation to be done, 
and that can take a while. Substitution 
also doesn’t allow you to see any of what’s 
going on. If you are trying to figure out what 
happens anywhere else in your system of 
equations, substitution doesn’t help much.
Q: Why is it ok to treat both equations 
as part of the same problem? Can you 
really exchange two variables in two 
different equations?
A: If the problem statement says that they 
are the same two variables, then they are! 
It can either be the problem situation (like 
Zach’s punch) or two specific equations that 
are given together. 
The reason you have two equations and two 
unknowns is that you know two different 
things about how these things are related. 
Q: How do I decide which equation to 
use first? How about which variable to 
solve for first?
A: It’s a bit of a judgement call, really. The 
best bet is to look at both equations and 
figure out which one is the easiest to work 
with. The important thing to remember is 
that you will always get to the right answer 
eventually, as long as you keep your 
algebraic manipulation within the rules.

Q: Can I use any variables that I want?
A: Yes! We picked s and f to stand for slow and fast,

Solving equations this way is called the elimination method. The 
elimination method is the process of adding up both of the equations 
and then working with the resulting equation.
This is a valid way of working with equations because both equations have 
the same unknowns, just with different relationships. Specifically, since 
you’re dealing with an equation where the left side, s+f, equals the right 
side, 60, you’re doing the same thing to both sides of the other equation. 
So you’re still following the rules of Algebra. This method is really useful 
because it can cut out a whole bunch of steps in your solution. 
The elimination method - a method of solving 
a system of equations through adding the 
two equations together and working with the 
resulting equation.
f is gone with almost no work
With some clever addition, you’ve gotten f out of both equations. Because these 
two equations are a system of equations, and they have the same unknowns, you 
can skip some steps by just adding up all of the terms of both equations. If the 
equations are set up right, you’ll lose one of the variables and make life much 
easier, without graphing or substitution.
Now you can solve for s, and then substitute it back into either one of the 
original equations and solve for f:

Q: Can we always just make variables 
disappear?
A: Yes, if your equations are set up the 
right way first. You need coefficients that will 
cancel each other out. We had -1f and+1f, 
which add up to zero. We’ll talk more about 
how you can set that up in a moment.
Q: Does it matter which equation we 
put the first solution into?
A: No. Once you solve for one of the 
unknowns, you can substitute your value into 
either equation to solve for the remaining 
unknown. 
That makes sense, right? The solution for a 
system of equations is still the ONE point 
that will solve both equations. That means 
for that one point, x and y (or s or f) are the 
same for both equations.
Q:Why is it ok to just add up two 
equations like this?
A: The elimination method is like high-
speed substitution. The variables are the 
same thing at the solution point. So you can 
work with both equations because they are 
both describing the same variables. Each 
equation is just written a different way, so 
combining them gets you a single solution. 
Adding the equations together is just another 
way of working with all of the variables. It’s 
like manipulating both equations at once.
Q: Which method should I use:  
graphing, substitution, or elimination?
A: The good news is that any of them 
will work for any problem. As you saw, the 
limits on the graphing method is you have to 
be able to read the graph, so it’s tough with 
decimal or fractional answers. 
  
Substitution is the most straightforward, but 
it’s a lot of back and forth. That can take a 
lot of time, and there’s a greater chance 
for mistakes. Elimination is great if your 
equations are setup right, and they’re usually 
pretty fast, too.
Q: What if the equations aren’t set up 
to cancel each other out?
A: Then you’ll need to manipulate one (or 
both) of the equations so you end up with 
variables that will cancel each other out.  
Suppose you have two equations, one with 
a -4f, and one with a +f. You could multiply 
that entire second equation by 4 (all of the 
terms, both sides of the equation so it stays 
equal), to get 4f, and then add the equations 
up. That will give you a situation where the 
variables will cancel out.

systems of equations
Manipulate your equations for elimination
Add the two punch equations together and, you’ll get an equation in two 
variables that you still can’t solve. To eliminate a variable, you need to 
have the coefficient in front of one of your variables be the opposite of the 
coefficient in front of the same variable in your second equation.
After figuring out your system of equations, you need to look at the system 
and figure out a couple of things:
Do either of the variables cancel each other 
out when you add the equations together?
For the punch equation, we started with 
+1c and +1c, and +1p and +0.4p. 
None of these cancel out right away.
1
If not, figure out what variable to eliminate.
Which variable are you going to try and get to be the 
opposite coefficient of the same variable in your other 
equation? Here’s where some strategy comes in.
2
Which variable?
The options with the punch are to change one of the +1cs to a -1c, or 
change around the +1p to a -0.4p, so the ps cancel out. 
Let’s try and work with c since there aren’t any decimals. So how do we 
change a +1c to a -1c? Multiply the entire equation by negative one. Then 
we can add the two equations and use elimination.
Determining the variable to cancel out, and manipulating the equation to get 
there, is the tricky part of the elimination method. Here are a few things you 
can look out for:
Look for variables with constants that 
are multiples of each other, like 2 and 4. 
And 1 works with anything.
To make the variable constants cancel 
each other out and keep your equation 
balanced, you need to multiply the entire 
equation by the right constant.

Q: What if I pick the wrong variable to eliminate?
A: There’s really no “wrong variable.” As long as you properly 
apply the rules of manipulating an equation, you won’t get the 
wrong answer. 
There is usually an “easiest” variable, though. You’ll get a better 
idea of which variables to choose as you have more experience 
solving equations, but if there’s one that has a coefficient of 
1, it’s usually easiest to go for that variable. Then, it’s easy to 
figure out what has to be done to the entire equation to make it 
work and eliminate the variable.
Q: Why is it ok to add up the two equations?
A: Because both equations are using the same variables, 
representing the same things. It’s just like adding two numbers 
together. But you can’t swap around sides or otherwise change 
the equations. Just add the two equations together to eliminate 
one variable, and solve. 
Q: Does it matter which equation I put my solution value 
back into?
A: No, either one will work. But just like choosing which 
variable to eliminate, there’s usually an easier equation to use. If 
one equation uses whole numbers, and the other uses fractions 
or decimals, it’s probably easier to use the equation with whole 
numbers to get a quicker solution.
Q: So I should use substitution for solving all my 
systems of equations?
A: It really just depends on the equation. You can use 
graphing, substitution, or elimination, and all will work. It’s really 
just a matter of figuring out what works best for you in a certain 
situation, and going with that. 
Remember: as long as you follow the rules, you’ll get the same 
answer no matter which method you use.

either the elimination method or the substitution method.
Zach has been working on figuring out his income from the party. He let people get tickets 
two ways—either in advance for $18, or at the door for $22. He had a total of 1,512 people

many were purchased at the door?
Zach ordered 11 cakes for the party and paid for them, but the bakery called him up and

systems of equations
Head First: What’s it like being a system of 
equations? Do you find you have identity problems?
System: Not at all—just because I have multiple 
equations, doesn’t mean I have multiple personalities! 
All of my equations work for the same problem.
Head First: I didn’t mean to upset you. I just meant 
that being made up of two completely different 
equations must be tricky.
System: It’s all I’ve ever known. Really, I just think 
it’s easier to have a couple of equations that describe 
me. The equations working together is what really 
makes me tick. Since I usually have two unknowns, I 
couldn’t be solved uniquely without both of them. 
Head First: There are a number of ways to solve 
you—let’s talk about substitution, okay?
System: Ok. The substitution method is one of my 
favorites because it gives you an exact answer, but 
there’s really not much planning involved. You just 
go ahead and get one variable in terms of the other, 
and then switch equations and substitute. It doesn’t 
require any fancy thinking ahead.
Head First: Doesn’t working that way occasionally 
get complicated?
System: That’s true. You get one variable, let’s 
say x, in terms of the other, which is probably y 
with some constants. As you start performing the 
substitution, there can be a lot of manipulating to 
work out a solution.
Head First: There’s another option for finding an 
exact solution, right?
System: Certainly, that’s the elimination method. 
With elimination, you have to figure out in advance 
what variable you need to cancel out. Once you do 
that, all of the manipulation is done in advance.
Head First: What do you mean?
System: Well, with the elimination method, you 
add up the two equations, all the terms on the left of 
both equals signs, and all of the terms on the right of 
both equals signs together. As long as one variable is 
eliminated, you will end up with one equation in one 
variable.
Head First: I see, that does sound easy. But 
speaking of seeing—what about those of us who like 
to see what’s going on?
System: Well then there’s the graphing method. 
To solve me that way, you just graph both equations 
and look for an intersection. Graphing is great for 
getting a sense of the trends of both lines and a good 
starting point for guessing what may be coming next, 
say if you add more cider.
Head First: System, it’s been a pleasure. You’re 
complicated, but nobody can say there aren’t plenty 
of ways to work with you!

When shopping leads to relationship ruin!
While Zach has been busy planning his party, his girlfriend, 
Kathleen, has been getting ready too.
In addition to being a fantasy-football mogul, Kathleen loves to shop. 
She’s been hitting the mall pretty hard lately, looking for something 
to wear to the party.
Kathleen’s shopping is not something that Zach is a big fan of, so 
when she gets a good deal, Kathleen makes sure Zach knows 
about it.
For the party, she needed dresses and shoes. She found an 
awesome sale: dresses for only $16 and shoes for $8 a pair. That 
means Kathleen only spent $72 in total!
While showing off her purchases, Kathleen said that she bought 
twice as many dresses as shoes and got 6 things all together.
Using his mad Algebra skills, Zach did some quick math and then 
got pretty upset. They’d argued about this before. “How could you 
lie to me?” he asked her.
How did Zach know that Kathleen was lying?

When shopping leads to relationship ruin -

How did Zach know Kathleen was lying?
To figure out that Kathleen was lying, Zach needed to 
to figure out how many pairs of shoes and how many 
dresses she actually bought. Let’s start with figuring 
up some equations:

Figure out the knowns from the problem:

Dresses: We’ll call them d, and they’re $16 
each.
Shoes:     We’ll call them s, and they’re $8 a pair.
Totals:    $72 spent, and twice as many dresses 
as pairs of shoes for a total of 6.

When shopping leads to relationship ruin - solved!
How did Zach know Kathleen was lying?
Zach knew from his quick math that there is no solution to Kathleen’s equations, 
so she must be lying about something.
The lines are parallel! That means that there isn’t any one 
point that will satisfy both equations. Parallel lines go on 
forever without crossing, so there’s no intersection. 
That means that what Kathleen said can’t be true because 
there’s no combination of shoes and dresses that will satisfy both 
equations. That means she has an extra dress or something!
Fifteen Minute 
Mystery 
Solved
Hmm - I noticed that 
those lines have the same slope 
but different intercepts...
Parallel lines share a slope, but 
nothing else.
That’s actually the key indicator that two lines are 
parallel. If you have two equations with the same 
slope, you don’t need to graph it. The lines are 
parallel, and there’s no solution.
Well, except for one case...

Sometimes two equations aren’t two lines
You know a lot about equations at this point: you can graph them a bunch of different ways, and 
if you have a system of equations, you can solve them three different ways. Not only that, but if 
you have two equations with the same slope, there’s no answer, right?
Not quite.
You can have two equations that have the same slope, but they may look a little different. 
However, when you plot them, the lines look exactly the same:

So, if you come across two lines with 
the same slope, just check and see if the 
intercepts are the same, too. If they are, it’s 
the same line, and if not, they’re parallel.

Breaking up is hard to do
Sometimes being square is enough to give you fits. 
So far, we’ve dealt with variables like x and y. But what happens when x is 
squared in your equations? It’s time to find out—and you already have the 
tools to solve these problems! Remember the distributive rule? In this chapter, 
you’re going to learn how to use distribution and a special technique called 
FOIL, to solve a new kind of equation: binomials. Get read—it’s time to 
break down some really tough equations.
So she said, “I totally hate

And we’re breaking up.” And that

Okay, but how did James actually come up 
with his answer? I mean, that’s great that the... 
ahem... producers had the right answer... but 
we don’t usually have people giving us answers, 
right? So what’s really going on?
Those expresions are binomials.
To understand what James did, you need 
to know how to handle exponents in 
equations. That means learning about 
binomials and polynomials.

All binomials
Even though these are 
numbers, they’re also terms
The two terms can be 
different variables.
One or both of the 
terms can be squared.
Not a binomial! 
Three terms = trinomial.
First term
Second term
There can be a mix of 
variables and numbers...
Remember, terms are held 
together with multiplication, so 
2x is actually just one term.
Polynomial - an expression containing any number of 
algebraic terms with whole number exponents of at least 0.
Binomial - is a special case of a polynomial that is a 
group of two algebraic terms.
Binomials are groups of two algebraic terms
Kate and James are working with binomials on this round of Math or No Math. 
A binomial is an expression that contains two algebraic terms. Binomials 
are actually part of a larger family: polynomials. Poly just means many, so a 
polynomial is any expression with multiple terms.
So anytime you see an expression with more than one term, think polynomial. 
And if there are just two terms, think binomial. Look:

The distributive property, revisited
Look back at the problem Kate and James were given in the contest. You 
can’t simplify the algebraic terms within the parentheses. So how about just 
doing the multiplication? Since the expression can’t be simplified, we’re going 
to have to do multiplication with multiple terms—we’re going to have to 
distribute. Both terms in the first binomial need to be distributed 
over both terms of the second binomial.
We need to multiply x 
times 2x and -1...
...and 3 times 2x 
and -1, also.
Distribute ALL of your first binomial...
The distributive property is all about multiplying groups together. Here’s 
what that looks like:
a
ab
ac
b
c
+
=
+
^
h
The distributive 
property
The first term
can be multiplied by both 
terms of the binomial
to get this...
That’s great if you only have one number multiplied over a binomial. But 
we’re dealing with is a binomial multiplied over a binomial. So we’ve first 
got to distribute both terms of the first binomial over the entire second 
binomial.
Multiplying two binomials means you 
have to distribute both terms from 
the first binomial over both terms of 
the second binomial.

Simplify binomials with the distributive property
So now we just need to actually distribute our entire binomial. Before digging into Kate 
and James’ problem, let’s take a look at how we’d do this distribution in general:
x
a
x
b

^

h

x x
b
a x
b
+
+
+
^
^
h
h
x
bx
ax
ab
2 +
+
+
Typical binomials: 
x plus a constant.
Split up the first binomial 
and distribute it...
...and then multiply 
everything out.
Now we can simplify a little bit more. We have two x terms, bx and ax. Since a and 
b are constants, bx and ax are actually like terms. We can combine those:
x
a
b x
ab
2 +
+
+
^
h
a and b are constants, like 2 
or 18. They can be added up.
This is combining like terms, to simplify the 
equation even further.

2x2 + 5x - 3
Q: The distributive property says we have to spread out 
both terms?
A: Yes. The distributive property says that you have to distribute 
the first binomial over the entire second binomial. That means both 
terms of the first binomial need to be multiplied by both terms of 
the second. 
Q: Expanding binomials seems complicated. Is there an 
easier way?
A: There are some tools you can use, but you’ve still got to 
know that multipying binomials is really about distribution. It’s not 
that bad as long as you take the first terms and multiply them over 
the second binomial.
Q: So this works the same for numbers and variables?
A: It sure does. Of course, in cases where you’ve got all 
numbers, you can just work inside the parentheses first and avoid 
all this distribution. But you’ve noticed something important: any 
rule that applies to variables also applies to numbers.
Q: How often do you really have to multiply binomials?
A: Actually, you’re most likely to use this the other way around. 
We’ll talk about it in the next section, but when you have certain 
types of equations, you’ll have to go from that equation to a couple 
of binomials. Sound confusing? Don’t worry, we’re going to spend 
a lot more time on that next.

Multiplying two binomials is a 
common Algebra problem.
To multiply two 

binomials, you 
need to apply the distributive 
property.
Each term of the first binomial 

needs to be multiplied by each 
term of the second binomial.

Kate cheated, didn’t she? She 
didn’t even show her work!
The SQUARE pattern
If you have two binomials that only differ in the sign of the second term, you’re 
dealing with a square pattern. In the problem that Kate and James just worked 
on, the first term of both binomials was x and the second term was 2 and -2.
Kate looked for patterns instead of 
working the problem out.
Have you ever noticed little patterns in a friend’s 
phone number or how a football team runs their 
offense? A pattern lets you figure out what’s going on 
based on some key things you recognize... and you 
don’t have to work anything out.
Math is like that sometimes, too. There are patterns 
that let you avoid lots of extra work.
This is the first term, 
x, squared.
This is the second 
term squared.
What you’ve got here is the difference of two squares. You square the 
first term and subtract from it the square of the second term. Everything 
else gets canceled out and goes away. 
So anytime you see two binomials that are exactly the same, except for 
the sign before one of the constants, then the solution is the difference of 
the squares of the two terms. You can just skip the middle steps and jump 
right to the answer!
look for square patterns
The first term in 
both binomials is x.
The second term in 
both binomials is 2.
We can work this out 
the normal way to see 
what the answer is.

to the final solution.

both binomials is x.
The second term in 
both binomials is 5.
This is with the 
same signs...
...and this is with 
opposite signs.

Q: Those patterns are great. Will they always work?
A: As long as the binomials match one of the patterns, then 
you bet! Just make sure you watch your signs and coefficients.
Q: What if the binomials are close but don’t exactly 
match one of those square patterns? 
A: Then you’re going to have to use distribution to figure out 
what the simplified equation really is. Multiply the terms through, 
collect your like terms, and then you have the answer. But these 
patterns only work if there’s an exact match.

Since the signs are 
different, the answer 
is the difference of 
two squares.
Square the first term, square 
the last term, and add 2 
times the first times the last 
term in the middle.
This isn’t as hard as it seems. You still square x 
and 7, but the difference is in the middle term. 
You multiply 2 by x by the second term, which is 
negative 7. So you get negative 14x.

Sometimes there’s just not a pattern...
Suppose you’re on a fast-paced, high-dollar game show, forced 
to simplify binomials at a moment’s notice. When the square 
patterns aren’t working, you’ve got to have another way to

But distribution isn’t that fast. Thankfully, there’s another sort

FOIL saves you an extra step, but it also makes the steps 
you do have to do a lot easier. You don’t have to think 
about distribution as much, and you’re usually left with an 
easy combining of like terms at the end.
And, best of all, FOIL always works, even if there’s not a

Un-distribution is called FACTORING
So far, we’ve talked a lot about distribution. That’s when you 
take a number or term and multiply it over a group of terms. But 
James did just the opposite of that... he un-distributed, which is 
called factoring in Algebraland. Let’s take a closer look. Here’s 
what James started with:

Here’s the original 
expression to solve.
James actually saw this another way, though... he saw that everything 
on the top part of the fraction could be represented as being 
multiplied by 11. So here’s how the same expression looks, with that 
11 shown explicitly:
When you’ve got a number or term that everything else is multiplied by, 
that number or term is called a factor. So 11—and x, for that matter—
is a factor of the top part of this equation:
But look... with that 11x pulled out, the remaining terms on the top 
match the fraction’s denominator exactly. So we can cancel all that out!
These two are the same 
quantity, so they cancel out.

11x is a factor... so we can 
un-distribute this factor and 
write is separately, like this.
A factor can be multiplied 
by your terms to get back 
to the original form of 
your equation or expression.
James basically pulled an 11 
out of each term... making 
the expression look like this.
This was the tricky one... but 
James realized that 33/4 is 
really the same as 11 * 3/4.
Nothing’s changed here... this is 
the same equation as before.
A factor is 
a term that’s 
multiplied over 
an ENTIRE 
expression.

Factoring is un-mulitplying
Pulling out common factors from a term or group is called factoring. (Clever, isn’t 
it?) Once you’ve pulled out a common factor, you can work with the group or the 
factor, doing things like canceling terms (which is what James did).
Factoring is, basically, the opposite of multiplying. And when you’re working with a 
group of terms, factoring is the opposite of distributing. Remember, the distributive 
property is all about multiplying groups together:
Factoring is the inverse of the distributive property.
 
Factoring is pulling numbers and terms apart 
by finding terms that multiply together to make 
another term or expression.

The distributive 
property
This is the 
common term.
That term is multipled by 
this group...
...to get this 
answer.
So the opposite of this is to take the solution, and pull out the common factor:
By taking advantage of the distributive property in reverse, you can pull out 
common terms. By manipulating the terms this way, you can set up an equation 
that is usually easier to work with. Sometimes you can cancel out a common 
factor, or even an entire group. 
(
)

a is a factor in 
both terms...
...so we can turn that 
into a common factor 
multiplied over a group.
factoring explained
The distributive 
property means 
that you need to 
evenly distribute a 
factor over all the 
terms of a group.

Factor by looking for common terms
Factoring isn’t a nice process like FOIL... it’s more like looking for patterns. 
But these aren’t patterns that are as easy as the square patterns. Instead, 
you’ve got to try and “see” common factors in an expression. Sound tricky? It 
is a bit, but you’ll get better with practice.
Here are some ways to get started when you’re solving an equation and you 
think factoring might help: 
Look at your equation. If there are quite a few terms, look for numbers 
that repeat, or multiples of numbers that keep showing up.
Next, figure out the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms 
you’re interested in. This is probably one of the numbers that kept 
showing up in the first step.
Pull out the GCF and write it down, and then write in a set of 
parentheses. Inside the parentheses, write the new terms that are 
left after the GCF is pulled out. These are your original terms, each 
divided by the GCF you just pulled out.
Start out by looking for repeating numbers. 
Here, you’ve got 11, 11/3, and 33/4... but 
33 is 3 * 11, so that’s another 11.
If you’re rusty on 
the GCF, jump to the 
appendix and brush up.

The common factor for 
all of those terms is 11x, 
so pull that out.
What’s left inside is the original 
terms divided by the GCF.

find the GCF of 11x,       x
and       x.

Head First: Welcome, Factoring. Good to have you!
Factoring: Thanks! I’m really looking forward to 
explaining more about who I really am.
Head First: There does seem to be some confusion. 
What exactly are you?
Factoring: Any time a term, set of terms, or 
equation has a factor removed from it, I’m the one 
doing with work.
Head First: That seems pretty general; can you be 
more specific?
Factoring: Not really, I’m just flexible that way. I’m 
a general term, that’s all.
Head First: Well then, what would you say your 
strengths are? How can you help?
Factoring: Well, when you use me to get your 
variable away from all of its coefficients, equations 
seem to get a lot easier to solve.
Head First: Ok, that makes sense. So it’s sort of like 
high-speed variable isolation, right?
Factoring: Exactly! One easy step and you’ve 
got your variable alone. Then you can solve your 
equation. Who doesn’t love that?
Head First: It does sound like you’re pretty 
powerful.
Factoring: Well, yeah! I don’t like to flex my 
muscles too much, but I do have some mad skills.
Head First: Do you work with any other 
properties?
Factoring: I’m the way you can undo a distribution 
or multiplication, since I identify factors and remove 
them from a group you’re working with.
Head First: Hmm, interesting.
Factoring: And, although I don’t work directly with 
them, the associative and commutative properties 
need to be involved most of the time, too.
Head First: Anything else you want to add?
Factoring: Don’t forget implied numbers! If a 
variable is written alone, there’s a one if you factor 
away the variable. People forget that all the time!
Head First: Thanks for your time... this was great.
Factoring: Thank you for letting me clear the air. I 
feel so separated from the group most of the time.

Zero times anything is 0
Kate was working her problem out the normal way, but James 
noticed something... his two terms multiplied out to zero. Suppose 
the first grouping is a, and the second grouping is b:
If:

:

b =

=

Both a and b can be quantities, 
numbers, variables, whatever.
Then:
and / or
Now, if a is (x-3) and b is (x+7), we just have to solve for x so that 
either (x-3) is 0, or (x+7) is 0.
If either of those groupings is zero, then it will cause the entire 
equation to go to zero. That’s called the Zero Product Rule: any 
number or term multipled by zero is always zero.
We need either a or b to be 
zero to make this work out.
Let’s zero these things out...

expanding binomials and factoring
Q: Does a common factor have to 
appear in all the terms in an equation?
A: You can factor any or all terms of the 
equation. But when you pull out the factor, 
it’s only multiplied by the terms you pulled 
that factor out of. 
In Algebra, all of the terms on one side of 
the equals sign are typically factored at once. 
But in more complicated math, you may 
have several factors in a single equation.
Q: What if I choose a right factor, but 
it doesn’t help me solve my problem?
A: As long as you  follow the rules and 
factor correctly, you can always go back 
to your original equation. Just like inverse 
operations and distributing, all of these tools 
can be tried out and undone if they don’t 
help.
Q:How come James got to work on 
only part of his equation at a time?
A: That’s thanks to the Zero Product Rule. 
Since only one part of the equation has to be 
zero, both of those pieces can be set equal 
to zero and then solved independently. By 
applying the ZPR, you can work with two 
equations separately, and both solutions will 
work.
Q: How can we have two solutions for 
a single equation?
A: Good question, and we’ll talk about 
that a lot more in the next chapter. For now, 
you just need to know that if you substitute 
each value you found for x back into the 
equation, and you get the right solution, 
you’re good to go.
Q: How can I tell when to factor?
A: Well, it depends. Usually you can get 
at the solution for a problem several different 
ways, factoring being just one of them.  
If you try factoring something and it doesn’t 
get you anywhere, don’t worry; just try 
something else!
Q: What about equations in terms of 
multiple variables? What if we have x, y, 
z, and w?
A: They can be factored the same way. 
If the GCF has multiple variables, you can 
factor them all out. Another strategy with an 
equation of multiple variables is to factor out 
just one of the variables, if you can. And, of 
course, the Zero Product Rule is always a 
great option. 

Factoring is a tool to 
help manipulate the 
equation.
Any time you pull out a 

common number or 
term, you’re factoring 
.
The 


Rule means that 
if terms multiplied 
together equal zero, 
then one or all of those 
terms must be zero.

Getting out of line
This is stupid. I’m just 
supposed to wait in this line 
all day? Look, it even curves 
around the block!
Not everything in life is linear. But just because an equation 
doesn’t graph as a straight line, doesn’t mean it’s unimportant. In fact, some 
of the most important unknowns you’ll have to work with in life end up being 
non-linear. Sometimes you’ve got to deal with terms that have exponents 
greater than 1. In fact, some equations with squared terms graph as curves! 
How’s that work? Well, there’s only one way to find out...

Jon’s upgrading his technology
Jon’s bringing in a catapult. With a catapult, he can be 
more accurate and hit Pi Gamma Delta’s president even 
harder, and that means he’ll get into the frat for sure! 
The catapult comes with a range equation in 
terms of height and distance. If you know how 
high you want a balloon to go, you can figure out 
where to place the catapult so it plummets right 
down on the Pi Gamma Delta president’s head.
This is the website where Jon 
ordered his catapult. The site 
lists the range of each catapult in 
terms of an equation
Only trouble is, Jon doesn’t know 
Algebra... that’s where you come in.

is on the ground.
To make this easier to

326    Chapter 9
Introducing a new type of equation: quadratic
A quadratic equation is any polynomial equation that has a degree of 
two; that just means that the largest exponent for any variable is two. The 
degree of the equation also dictates how many solutions there can be, and 
since a quadratic equation has a degree of two, these equations can have 
up to two solutions. 
So Jon’s equation needs to be manipulated to solve for x twice. The Zero 
Product Rule (ZPR) can also help. If we can manipulate the quadratic 
equation so it’s a product of two quantities equal to zero, these equations 
will be a lot easier to solve.
Expanding two binomials made a quadratic equation, so maybe factoring 
the quadratic back to two binomials is the way to go. Let’s try that and see 
what happens.
Any equation with 
a degree of 2 is a 
quadratic equation.
We saw with linear equations, 
like 3 = 4x - 2 (which is a 
degree of one) that there is 
one solution per variable.

For the first shot, the Pi Gamma Delta president is sitting on the lawn, so 
h = 0. Figure out x so they can place the catapult in the right spot.
To make this easier to 
work with, multiply 
both sides by -1.
Now, what’s x? Try a couple of values out with 
substitution and see what you come up with.
try x = 10
102 - 10(10) - 75 = 0 ?
-75 = 0
try x = 20
202 - 10(20) - 75 = 0 ?
125 = 0
try x = 0
02 - 10(0) - 75 = 0 ?
-75 = 0
You may have picked different values. That’s 
ok, but it’s pretty obvious that trial and 
error isn’t the way to go. There must be a 
way to solve these things algebraically.
We actually saw several 
quadratics last chapter... we

Where does Jon put the catapult?
So x is -5 or 15. But what does that actually mean? How can a catapult fire a 
balloon a distance of -5? Keep in mind the context of this problem. How can a 
water balloon travel -5 anything?
A negative distance means that the balloon goes behind the front of the catapult. 
That doesn’t make sense in this context, so we can ignore that answer. What we 
needed was the 15. The balloon will travel 15 feet. So let’s shoot the catapult from 
15 feet away from the president...
Uh oh... the president’s relocated
While you were figuring out how to hit the president, he got clever and moved! 
Now the president’s hiding in a custom-dug water balloon bunker.

The 21 foot hole changes things. Write the new equation that you 
need to solve for Jon.
h = -x2 + 10x + 75
You have to go back to the original equation, 
so you can substitute the new h back in.
-21 = -x2 + 10x + 75
The height is a negative 
height because it’s a a hole 
and it’s below the ground.
+21 -21 = -x2 + 10x + 75 + 21
0 = -x2 + 10x + 96
You should always factor with a PLAN
If we’re going to get the balloon to hit the president, we’ve got to 
solve our quadratics faster this time.
What we did with the first equation wasn’t very organized, or 
consistent. We tried a bunch of factors, and then had to do FOIL in 
reverse. Neither was that quick.
Let’s look closer at what we did with x2 - 10x +75 = 0 and figure out 
how to get a bit faster.
We need a standard form.
The equation needes to be in the standard form of a quadratic, set 
to zero. You have to have the zero, or you can’t use the zero product 
rule and split up the possible solutions.
1
We need two binomials.
Once the equation is in the proper form, you know you’re going to 
need two binomials that start with x. Fill those in and you’ve already 
got half of the terms ready.
2
Figure out the other two terms in the binomials.
The last two terms need to accomplish two things. First, they have to 
be multiplied together to get the constant in the quadratic equation. 
Second, they need to add together to get the middle x term.
3
x2 - 10x - 75 = 0
(x    15)(x    5) = 0
(x      )(x      ) = 0
The standard form of a quadratic 
equation is three terms:
an x2 term, an x term, and a constant.
These need to be multiplied 
together to get 75.
These need to be added (or subtracted) 
to get the x term the -10x.
factoring takes planning

Fill in the signs and check your work.
To finish up your binomials, fill in the signs. Your binomial constants 
need to be multiplied to get the same sign in front of the constant (75), 
and added to get the right x term (-10x). Then, expand the binomials 
you came up with, using FOIL, and make sure that it matches what you 
started with.
4
(x - 15)(x + 5) = 0
Factoring Up Close
Picking the last two terms to fill in for the binomials is the trickiest part of 
factoring. Sometimes it helps to get even further into the details.
(x      )(x      ) = 0
Picking these two
The easiest way to find out what numbers you can use is to list all of the possible 
factors of the constant term of the quadratic equation. Why? Because when you 
multiply this thing back out using FOIL, you know that those two numbers multiplied 
together will end up as the constant in your equation.
75 = 75   1
     = 25   3
     = 15   5
Once you know that these are the options, then 
you move on to look at the x term, 10, in our 
case. There needs to be a set of these that 
added (or subtracted) together gets to 10.
15 - 5 = 10
Look over these factors closely. Which pair will let you get to the middle x term? Since 
our middle x term is 10, we can take 15 and 5, which have a difference of 10.
(x    15)(x    5) = 0
x2 - 10x - 75 = 0
x2 + 5x - 15x - 75 = 0
Use your new factoring skills and the equation you just wrote for the subterranean president to 
figure out where the catapult needs to go now.

0 = -x2 + 10x + 96
This is not quite the right 
form... but you can swap the 
zero to the other side.
-x2 + 10x + 96 = 0
-1 (-x2 + 10x + 96 ) = -1(0)
x2 - 10x - 96 = 0
x + 6 = 0
x - 16 = 0
- 6 + x + 6 = 0 - 6
+ 16 + x - 16 = 0 + 16
x = -6
x = 16
(x + 6)(x - 16) = 0
x2 - 16x + 6x - 96 = 0
x2 - 10x - 96 = 0
Use  FOIL to check this
Then get rid of 
that -1.
(x      )(x      ) = 0
The options for the last 
two terms come from 96 = 96   1
     = 48   2
     =32   3
     =24   4
     = 16    6
We also know that we need -10x 
in the middle, so the two terms 
need to work out to 10.
(x + 6)(x - 16) = 0
(x     16)(x     6) = 0
For the signs to get a -96, one has to be positive, and one negative. 
Since we want a -10x, the bigger number is the negative, -16
Now we’re in standard form 
for a quadratic equation.
Jon needs to stick the catapult back 16 feet to 
hit Pi Gamma Delta where it hurts!
Yeah! Direct hit! He can 
run, but he can’t hide...
Use your new factoring skills and the equation you just wrote for the subterranean president to

quadratic equations
Q: Do I have to write all of those teeny steps?
A: Not forever. Whenever you learn something new, it’s good to 
write down as much as you can so that you can check your work. 
We actually wrote down a few middle steps that make it easier to 
understand. The binomial only needs to be written once, not 3 times. 
The bottom line is that you should write down as many steps as you 
need to so that you can understand and complete your work.
Q: Is this just FOIL backward?
A: Yes! We’re working on figuring out what two binomials will get 
you back to where you started. Why? Because if you apply the Zero 
Product Rule, you can solve the quadratic!
Q: What are quadratics good for in the real world?
A: Quadratic equations can be used to address a whole new set of 
real world scenarios. For instance, Jon’s equation is a simplified form 
of a projectile motion equation that describes how objects will travel 
in the air.  
Quadratic equations are also used to design parabolic microphones, 
satellite dishes, and suspension bridges. They are even used to 
design water fountains like those outside fancy Las Vegas hotels.
Q: How can one equation have two solutions?
A: When you have an equation with a degree of two, there are two 
solutions. Remember, a solution means a number that makes the 
equation true; that’s it. As you check your solutions, you’ll see that 
there really are two ways to make these equations work.
Q: What’s standard form for a quadratic equation?
A: The general way to write it is ax2 + bx + c = 0.
Q: What if there’s an ax2? We’ve only done just x2 terms.
A: Things get more complicated. The process doesn’t change, but 
if you think back to FOIL, that means two things. First, the first terms 
of the binomials need to come up to ax2, not just x2, so now you’re 
looking at a coefficient in front of one or both of the x terms.   
Second, that means when you expand the binomials back out you 
have to keep that coefficient in mind when you’re getting the x term. 
It means you’re looking at a lot more trial and error to get it done.
Q: Can you always factor an equation?
A: Yes and no. There are methods, like completing the square, 
that allow you to work with fractions to factor any equation. But it’s 
tricky and really more of an Algebra 2 topic, anyway.  
So what does a quadratic that doesn’t easily factor look like? Good 
question. Turn the page and see...

After using that formula from the side of the box, we figured out that 9 feet 
works for the catapult at two locations: -4.54 feet and 14.54 feet. 
Both of these numbers are the distance from the front of the catapult to the 
location where the water balloon will be 9 feet off the ground. That’s good 
news for Jon because it means that the water balloon is above 9 feet before 
it passes the front of the catapult and until 14.54 feet away. As long as the 
catapult is less than 14.54 feet from the wall, it should clear it!

The quadratic formula
The other way to solve a quadratic equation besides factoring is by 
using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is written for 
the standard form of a quadratic equation that allows you to solve any 
quadratic equation, whether or not it can be factored.

This is the x in the 
quadratic equation.
The a, b, and c in this equation 
are the a, b, and c in the 
standard form of a quadratic.
This symbol means “plus or minus.”
The quadratic formula is great because you can use it to solve any 
equation, but it is a bit cumbersome. To get both solutions for the 
quadratic (remember, a quadratic has two solutions), you have to work 
with the “plus or minus” symbol. To handle that, you simplify the 
expression once for addition of the quantity under the root, and a second 
time for subtraction of the quantity under the root, like this:
x

What was that thing that you 
used? Jon just found it in the 
small print on the website!
It’s the quadratic formula.
There’s a formula out there that can give you the solution 
to any quadratic equation—no factoring required— and it’s 
what was printed on the side of the box. 
Standard form is :
ax2 + bx + c = 0

Q: Why didn’t we use the quadratic formula first? Isn’t 
factoring a waste of time?
A: We didn’t do this first because we knew that you would say 
that! The quadratic formula is fantastic if you can’t factor, but if you 
can, factoring quickly gives you the whole number solutions. 
 
Another issue with the quadratic formula is that it’s easy to mess 
up. You need to watch the order of operations and the square root. 
If you get either of those wrong, then your answers will be wrong.
Q: That square root was really long. How much of it do we 
have write down?
A: It’s a judgement call. There is a standard for how many 
decimals you should use, called scientific notation. For now, let’s 
say that two to four decimal places is enough.
Q: What if there are fractions for a, b, or c?
A: That’s no problem. You can do two things: 
 
First, just go ahead and put the fractions in the quadratic equation 
and simplify. It can sometimes be pretty difficult to do that, but if 
you watch your order of operations, there shouldn’t be a problem. 
 
The other option is to multiply the equation by a number that will 
allow you to clear the fractions, like 4 if you have 1/4 or 3/4, then 
use the resulting coefficients in the quadratic formula.
Q: Will the square root always be a decimal?
A: Most of the time it will be, so you’ll need a calculator. There 
are, of course, perfect squares (9, 16, 25, etc.), but it’s not very 
often you’ll get one under the radical.
Q: Will real world equations have decimals?
A: Most of the time you’ll have decimals. Unfortunately, the 
real world tends to be messy and not easily quantified. A lot of 
equations deal with real materials (like water or steel) or real 
phenomenon (like speed) are based on measurement, which 
typically are written in decimals.
Q: Where did the quadratic formula come from?
A: The quadratic formula can be derived using a special 
factoring technique called “completing the square.” If you use the 
a, b, and c general constants when you complete the square, you’ll 
come up with the quadratic formula. 
 
You’ll learn how to complete the square for any equation later on in 
math... it’s nothing to worry about right now.
Q: What if the value under the root is negative?
A: You mean, what if b2 - 4ac is negative? Well, you can’t take 
the root without learning about a whole new class of numbers... 
and that’s another book altogether. 
 
So what do you do if you come across this now? Keep reading...
	
       The quadratic formula requires precision.
You have to get the order of operations right when you’re 
working with the quadratic formula. Everything under the 
radical has to be simplified before you can take the root.
You also have to watch the signs! It’s easy to lose track, so if you need to 
write all your steps out, that’s a good way to keep from making mistakes.

What the heck is a discriminant?
Wait a second! I thought that the quadratic 
formula was always supposed to work. With that 
first one, we’re totally stuck before we even finish 
under the radical! In the second one, the root just 
goes away. What’s that about?
The quadratic formula always works... but it may give 
you some surprising answers.
A quadratic can have two solutions... but it can also have one solution. And, 
to really throw you, sometimes the solutions are undefined. An undefined 
solution is what we call a solution that forces you to take the square root of a 
negative number.
So how do you know what to expect? It’s all about the discriminant.
The discriminant is the portion of the quadratic formula that is under the 
radical, that square root sign:
x

This piece 
is the

IF

b
ac

, then there is only one unique solution.
IF 
 
4
0
b
ac <
2 -
, then the solutions are undefined.
In this case, there’s just a single solution that makes the quadratic true.
Here, there aren’t any real x values that will make the equation true. This is 
because you’d have to take the root of a negative number.
This is the typical situation we’ve been dealing with so far: two solutions that 
are independent and real.

Head First: Hi Discriminant. It seems you haven’t 
gotten much publicity lately.
Discriminant: So true. Most of the time, people 
are required to learn about me, but they just don’t 
appreciate my usefulness.
Head First: Umm, yeah. So, what exactly are you 
good for?
Discriminant: I’m a short cut! Using the quick 
b2 - 4ac check can save you from doing lots of work.
Head First: How so?
Discriminant: If you just run that formula and 
compare it with zero, you can figure out how many 
answers you’re looking for with a quadratic equation.
Head First: I see. So if you’re less than zero, the 
solutions are undefined, right?
Discriminant: That’s true. There aren’t any real 
numbers that can be squared to get a negative 
number. 
Head First: What about if you’re equal to zero?
Discriminant: There’s just one number that works - 
so if you’re going to solve the equation, you know that 
you’re only looking for one answer.
Head First: And if you’re greater than zero?
Discriminant: Then there are two solutions, like 
you’d expect for a quadratic equation.
Head First: So it’s a neat little trick to figure that 
stuff out, but how does it really help to figure you out 
first, instead of just factoring?
Discriminant: It’s almost like checking your work 
in advance. If you know how many solutions you’re 
after, you’ll know when you get some solutions you’re 
on the right track.
Head First: That seems helpful. Do you have any 
other tips?
Discriminant: If you figure me out and I turn out to 
be a perfect square, the solutions to the equation may 
be a round number.
Head First: Just to review, why are the solutions 
undefined if you’re negative?
Discriminant: Because you can’t take a root of a 
negative number. A negative square root is undefined. 
That’s a property of a square root. 
Head First: Thank you so much for your time. Now 
I think we all have a better understanding of what you 
do.
Discriminant: Thank you! I’m so sick of being seen 
as a waste of time. I’m actually a real time saver.

Q: Checking my work with the quadratic formula 
is a pain...
A: Yeah, it kinda is, but it’s worth it. The quadratic 
formula is pretty easy to mess up... those signs can be 
a real killer. 
The decimals make checking your work tricky, too, and 
they make solving the original equation difficult. That’s 
why checking your work is so important!
Q:Why can’t you take a negative square root?
A: Because a negative times a positive is a negative. 
A square root is supposed to be two things that are 
exactly the same multiplied together, and you can’t do 
that and get a negative. 
You can, though, take a cube root of a negative number. 
Since a cube root is three numbers multiplied together, 
a negative times a negative is a positive, times another 
negative is a negative. 
Q: If I want to start with the discriminant, do I 
have to get the actual solution for it to be useful?
A: You can totally eyeball it! If you get 1 minus some 
giant number, it’s obviously negative, and that’s all you 
need. Just use your best judgement!
Q: Which is better, factoring or the quadratic 
formula?
A: It depends. Usually, if an equation’s factorable, 
then factoring is easier. If you start with the discriminant 
and it comes out as a perfect square, it’s probably a 
good idea to try factoring first. If you factor, you get 
nice whole number answers, which makes life so much 
easier. 
On the other hand, if you just want to solve an equation, 
go quadratic, and you’ll get the answer every time. The 
downside is that it’s easy to mess up.

Jon’s water balloon can only go up so high, and there’s a different x for

How can you graph x2?
We know lots of stuff about an equation in the degree of one: it has 
a slope, some intercepts, and it’s a straight line. But a second-degree 
equation may have some other shape that we don’t know about yet. 
We do know that it can have two solutions, not just one, which must 
mean something about the graph... 
The simplest way to plot a graph of an equation is to plot a few 
points, and then connect the dots. Since we don’t know the shape of 
this graph, let’s start by picking a bunch of points and plotting them

A parabola is the shape of a quadratic equation
A parabola is basically a “U” shape. The width and placement of the U-shape 
changes, depending on the equation. A parabola is also symmetrical around an 
 axis of symmetry and it’s lowest (or highest) point is called the vertex.
y
x 2
=
Axis of 
symmetry
Vertex is at 
the origin.
The overall shape is 
called a parabola.
The simplest parabola, y = x2, is symmetric about the y-axis, and the vertex is the 
origin (0, 0). It’s the most basic parabola, and that makes it a great example to use 
to talk about the parts of the graph of a quadratic equation.
Once you start adding x terms, coefficients, and constants to a quadratic equation, 
the graph changes. Jon’s catapult graph was upside down because our quadratic 
had a -x2 term. Other coefficients in front of the x2  affect how wide of narrow the 
U-shape is. The x term and the constant term in a quadratic equation move the 
basic parabola around on the plane: up, down, or side to side.
The y = x2 parabola is the basic 
shape of all quadratic equations.
a quadratic is shaped like a parabola
This is an invisible 
line that splits the 
parabola in half.
This particular parabola’s 
axis of symmetry is the 
y-axis. But it doesn’t 
always work out that way.
Symmetrical means it’s the same 
on both sides of the graph.

The vertex is ( 5, 100)
Graphing a parabola depends upon the vertex
Once you know what the vertex of a quadratic equation is, you can pick some points on 
the left and right of the vertex to draw a nice curve. That’s all you need!
Finding the x-coordinate for the vertex is easy, it’s: x
2a
b
=-
-x2 + 10x + 75 = h
To find our catapult’s vertex, start with the equation in standard form and use the formula:
Substitute the 
x-coordinate for the 
vertex back into the 
equation to get the vertical 
coordinate (h, in our case).
Use and understand the vertex
The vertex is either the top or the bottom of the parabola. How can you tell? If 
the quadratic starts with a positive x2 term, it’s the bottom of the parabola; if the 
quadratic starts with a negative x2 term, it’s the top of the parabola.
Vertex
Vertex
To finish the graph after you 
know the coordinates for the 
vertex, you just need a couple 
of points along the two sides of 
the parabola to finish the graph.
To pick the rest of the points to 
graph, just go to the left and the 
right of the vertex, and you’ll 
have the basic shape.

If you go up 30 feet, the options are 
Up 15 feet, it’s either -4 or 14.5 feet, so put the catapult 14.5 feet from the porch.
The catapult won’t go that high! It’s more than the vertex, at 100 feet, so we’ll miss him.

Work with the parabola, the SMART way
Now that you know all about the shape of a parabola and how it relates to the equation 
and the discriminant, we can put it all together and see how everything works. 
-x2 + 10x + 75 = h
Our original 
equation
We know that the parabola is pointing down because the 
x2-coefficient is -1.

You can easily figure out the vertex with

x
2a
b
=-
x = -(10) = 5
2(-1)
-(52) + 10(5) + 75 = h
-(25) + 50 + 75 = h
100 = h
Substitute this back into 
the original equation to find 
the other vertex coordinate.
Evaluate the discriminant to find out how many solutions there will be 
for the catapult’s quadratic equation.
3
discriminant = 102 - 4(-1)(75)
= 100 + 300
= 400
Since this is greater than zero, that 
means there are two real solutions.
Two real solutions to the 
equation indicates two x 
values where the vertical 
value (h in our case) is 
zero. We already know 
those values:
This was the first 
time you solved the 
equation, h = 0.
(15, 0) and (-5, 0)
What if the discriminant 
was 0 or less than 0? What 
would that mean for the graph?
The parabola can sit two other 
ways on the Cartesian plane 
with respect to the x-axis.
b2 - 4ac
That means the vertex is at (5, 100) when you plot the graph.

The solutions are undefined and the graph 
sits above the x-axis and never crosses.
Like the picture of y = x2, the graph sits on the x-axis but won’t cross the axis.
An undefined solution means that the quadratic equation has no number that 
will work  if the equation is set to zero. On a graph, it’ll look like it’s floating...
The solutions for the quadratic equation are the two values that work when the 
equation is set to zero and where it crosses the x-axis. 
The discriminant can help with our graph, too
Discriminant values fall into three categories: greater than zero, less than zero, or zero. 
We’ve talked about what those values mean for the number of solutions to a quadratic 
equation, but what about for the graph of a quadratic?
So here’s our final graph:
Take all that information, and you’ll end up with the same graph as 
before. But, this time, we’ve got some built-in checks for our work. 
We knew to expect an upside-down parabola, with two real solutions, 
that crossed the x-axis in two places.
The solutions 
for a quadratic 
equation are 
the x values 
when the 
other variable 
(usually y) is 0.

The parabola should be 
upside down and cross

The solutions 
are (-5, 0) and 
(15,0) which work 
with what the 
discriminant told us.

quadratic equations
Q: What’s the deal with always having two answers?
A: When we talked about the discriminant, there were three 
different options for answers. One answer, two answers, or no 
answers. The basic parabola, y = x2, only touches the x-axis at 
one point, so that’s one solution.  
The typical parabola, like the catapult’s, has two solutions and two 
places it crosses the x-axis. When we used the quadratic formula 
to solve this equation, the answers we got were the two places 
that the parabola crosses the x-axis.
Q: How do I find the vertex again?
A: The vertex has a consistent x coordinate,                  .It 
is a fantastic place to start plotting points because it’s the top 
(or bottom) of the parabola, and you know that you’ll have 
symmetrical points on either side of the vertex.
Q: Is there another way to graph a parabola besides 
plotting points?
A: Yes, but it’s complicated. We’re just scratching the surface 
on parabolas, and in order to learn all the deep dark secrets of 
parabolas, there’s a lot more math involved. Algebra 2 will explain 
all of that! For now, we’ll stick with plotting points, usually starting 
with the vertex.
Q: Which kind of quadratic equations have a graph that is 
an upside down parabola?
A: If an equation has a negative x2 term, the parabola is upside 
down, or pointed down. If the x2 term is positive, then the parabola 
is upward. 
Q: Is there a way to find the axis of symmetry?
A: The axis of symmetry is the vertical line that goes through 
the vertex of the parabola.  
So if you think back to the standard form of a vertical line, it’s just 
x = the x - coordinate of the vertex, which is:

tools for your algebra toolbox
Form matters.
The equation needs to be in standard form of a quadratic, 
set to zero. You have to have the zero or you can’t use 
the zero product rule and split up the possible solutions.
Set up the binomials.
Once the equation is in the proper form, you know you’re 
going to need two binomials that start with x. Fill them 
in and you’ve already got half of the terms done!
Find out the other two terms 
in the binomials.
The last two terms need to accomplish two things. 
They have to be multiplied together to get the 
constant in the quadratic equation (75). They also 
need to add together to get the x term (-10x).
Fill in the signs and check your work.
To finish up the factor, fill in the signs. They need to be 
multiplied to get the same sign in front of the constant (75) 
and added to get the right x term (-10x). Then, expand the 
binomials you came up with, using FOIL, and make sure that it 
matches what you started with.

You’ll find that in the real world, many equations are limited. There are only certain values that 
an equation is good for. For instance, you can’t drive a car -5 miles or dig a hole 13 feet up. In 
those cases, you need to set boundaries on your equations. And when it comes to putting 
some limits on your equations, there’s nothing better than a function. A function? What the

R = 1000(20) + 100x
R = 20,000 + 100x.
For 1515 seats, R = 20,000 + 100(1515) = 171,500
PJ Death’s cut 5% = (0.05)(171,500) = $ 8,575
Pretty good for one show!
Uh oh... there’s a change in venue
At the last minute, the taping location changed. Now only 1,511 seats are 
available, not 1,515. Sound hokey? In the real world, limits exist all the time. An 
equation on paper doesn’t have limits, but problems in the real world do.
Our current equation doesn’t say enough about the problem it models. Sure, we 
can solve for R, but there’s nothing to prevent us from accidentally putting in too 
many seats for x... and overestimating what Pajama Death will actually make.
Limits for this equation will come from the x vales, not R. Since R is totally 
dependent upon x, if you limit x, which is the number of tickets, then R will 
also be limited. 
So what do we know about the number of tickets (x)? 
Worst case?
The worst case scenario for Pajama Death and ticket sales? Nobody 
comes. That’s zero tickets sold.
 
Best case?
Pajama Death sells out all 1,511 seats. If you sell more than that, 
people are going to be mad because they’ll have nowhere to sit... so 
that’s the maximum x value.
 
How can we 
turn the these

functions
A function can be expressed as an equation
A function is really just a special type of equation, and usually carries 
along some extra information. And since equations can also be functions, 
there needs to be different notations for functions, so we can tell what 
we’re dealing with. A function isn’t written in terms of a variable like y, 
but is instead written like this: f(x).
So we can use the powers of a function to limit the revenue equation for 
Pajama Death, we need to rewrite the equation as a function. To limit 
the number of tickets, we’re looking to work with the x variable, right? 
That means the expression needs to contain x and be set equal to f(x). 
So we can dump R, and rewrite this equation as a function:
Fill in the limits for the Pajama Death revenue function.

Equations have limits (most of the time)
The real world is full of limitations like tickets, time available for a TV 
show, the number of songs that Pajama Death can sing before they lose 
their voices...  and each of these limits may need to be modeled with math.
Fortunately, Algebra just happens to have the perfect thing for this 
situation: a function. Among other things, a function can limit certain 
values for its variables. These variables are called inputs in a function.
For Pajama Death, the limits will be the maximum and minimum number 
of tickets, x,  that can be sold. Those limits will make sure that we don’t 
go figuring numbers for more seats than there are, and in turn, limits the 
amount of money that Pajama Death can make in a show. 
20, 000

f
x
x =

^ h
This f means “a

The variable inside the parentheses 
is the input variable.
The equals sign means something slightly 
different now, it means “is defined by”.
Just like regular variables, 
a function doesn’t have to 
be f(x), it can be c(d) or 
r(x). But f(x) is the most 
common function you’ll see.
In the Pajama Death equation, 
rewritten as a function, the 
input would be x, the number 
of seats sold.

382    Chapter 10
The input limits are the domain of 
the function
All functions have a domain, which is the set of valid inputs for 
the function. The group of values which is valid for the function 
is usually written as an inequality. The domain inequality is 
in terms of the input variable, which is the variable inside the 
parentheses of the f(). 
So for our function, x is the input, and the domain is all the 
numbers that x can take on: 0 to 1,511.
0

1511
1511
In general, the domain of a function can be completely 
arbitrary (based on the problem or it’s situation) or 
defined because of the expression itself. How many 
tickets you can sell is arbitrary, because it’s dictated by 
how many seats are in the arena. It’s not something 
related to the math expression.

Q: What do you mean, limited because of the 
expression itself?
A: Many mathematical expressions don’t go on forever, 
and are self-limiting. If you have an expression with an 
x denominator, a parabola that only covers part of the 
Cartesian plane, or a place where you may end up with 
a negative square root, the domain is limited due to the 
expression, not necessarily because of the real world 
problem the function models.

How much did the band make for the first show? If the numbers 
stay at 473 for the remaining 10 shows, will they make enough to 
buy the new equipment they want?
What a terrible turnout. 
We’re never going to sell out 
stadiums! We can’t sell out and 
still not get our gear! That’s a 
total zero-input situation.

Pajama Death needs $52, 375 by the 
end of the season, 10 more shows
f(x) = 20000 + 100x
f(473) = 20000 + 100(473)

473 is within the 
domain, so it’s ok to use.
f(473) = 67300
This is the total show revenue
5% of the revenue = (0.05)(67300) = $ 3,365
That’s a lot less than the band needs.
Total at 473 = 11 (3365)
11 - that’s 10 more shows plus 
the one that already happened
Total at 473 = $37, 015
$37, 015 is way less than $ 52,375
Pajama Death is not going 
to make enough for the new 
equipment they need!

Functions have minimum and maximum outputs
Function inputs make up the domain, we know that. By limiting the numbers that can 
go into a function, we’re limiting the numbers that can come out of a function. If only 
1,511 tickets can be sold, we can figure out the most that f(x) can equal... and we can do 
the same for the minimum value of the function. These minimum and maximum values 
are the limits for the output of the function.
The process of determining a function’s outputs is called evaluating the function. So 
every time you plug in x, and solve for f(x), you’re evaluating the function for a certain 
input value. That’s really just like solving the equation, which you’ve done a ton of times.
So what’s the MAXIMUM we can make?  
What’s the MINIMUM?
Using the domain as the starting point, we can find the minimum and maximum 
outputs of a function. That’s basically saying, how small and how big can f(x) get?

All of the valid outputs are called the range
Just as there is a set of inputs over which the equation is valid (the domain) 
for every function - there is also a range. The range of a function is the set 
of numbers over which there are valid outputs. The range actually provides 
the minimum of the function (the lowest possible output) and the maximum 
(the highest possible output) of the function.
You write the range like the domain: as an inequality. Also like the domain, 
functions are written with their range so you can know the limits of the 
function’s outputs. And, of course, the range for certain functions will be 
limited because the graph may not cover the entire Cartesian plane.

be as an ordered pair (1511, 171100)
This is how much the band would 
make for one sold out show.

Suppose there are 10 more sold out 
shows with the one lousy show...
That’s much more than 
the $52,375 they need!
	
       The limits of the domain don’t always give you 
the maximum and minimum outputs of a function.
In the case of the revenue function, the least value of the 
domain results in the minimum value of the range, and the 
highest value for the domain results in the maximum. That’s 
because we’re dealing with a line that has a positive slope. If the line had 
a negative slope, though, the values would be reversed. If we had a curve, 
the maximum could be in the middle of the domain!

functions
What we’ve learned about functions so far are some characteristics of functions: 
domain, range, inputs, and outputs. But what’s a function, really?
The official definition of a function is:
A function is a relation where one input results 
in a single output. It can be represented as an 
equation or as a set of ordered pairs, and has 
both a domain and a range. 
Ok, so functions have a domain 
and a range. Is there anything else 
I’ve got to worry about? This stuff 
seems pretty useful...
Functions have a very specific definition.
The thing about functions is that they aren’t always 
defined in terms of equations. Functions are even more 
general...

Algebra is really about relations
A relation is the general way in which two sets of numbers go together, 
and they are usually represented as ordered pairs. The difference 
between a relation and an equation is that there does not need to be a 
pattern in a relation: it can be totally random. A relation does have a 
domain and a range, which you can determine directly from reading the 
ordered pairs.
Let’s look at a simple relation that’s not based on an equation to get an 
idea of what we’re talking about:
{(4, 1), (4,
1), (2, 0)}
-
This is a relation. The 
curly braces are the 
beginning and the end of 
the relation.
{2, 4}
{
1, 0, 1}
-
Domain:
Range:
The domain and range come from 
reading the points in the relation.
Relation - A set of ordered pairs 
with a domain and a range. 
All you need 
for a relation 
is a set of 
ordered pairs.
A function is just a specific type of relation. It’s a relation that has 
one output for one input. That means that the relation above 
is not a function, because for the input 4, there are two possible 
outputs, 1, and -1.
{(4, 1), (4,
1), (2, 0)}
-
The x value is the input, 
and there are two in this 
relation that input 4.

{
1, 0, 1}
-

Range:
There are two possible outputs 
for the input 4, -1 and 1

functions
Q: A function doesn’t have to be an 
equation?
A: Nope. A function can be an equation, 
but it can also be a set of ordered pairs. In 
that case, the ordered pairs are going to 
be (input, output). Ordered pairs probably 
seem weird, but it’s much easier to figure 
out the domain and the range - it’s given! 
And remember, an equation for a line 
defines an infinite set of ordered pairs. 
Q: Are range and domains given, or 
do I have to figure them out?
A: It depends upon the situation. 
Sometimes the domain or the range will 
be given, sometimes it will be part of the 
problem statement (like ticket sales), and 
sometimes you’ll need to figure it out. But 
more about that later. 
Q: One input and one output... 
what’s the big deal about that?
A: It means that in a function you won’t 
get two f(x) values for one x, ever. 
Q: Are all equations functions?
A: Nope. That’s something that you’ll 
need to figure out soon enough, too. If an 
equation has multiple output values for one 
input, it’s not a function. It’s still a perfectly 
good equation, though.
Q: The ordered pairs look a lot like 
ordered pairs for graphing. Is that a 
coincidence?
A: No, you can graph functions just 
like you graph points or equations. We’re 
coming up on the details of how it works, 
but graphing helps out a lot with functions.
Q: Does the one input, one output 
thing mean that you can’t have the 
same f(x) value as an output for 
different inputs?
A: You’re saying, can you have a 
function like this f(x) = {(1,4), (-1,4)}? The 
function can have the same outputs for 
different inputs, that’s fine. You just can’t 
go the other way... so {(1,4), (1,3)} is 
NOT a function. You can’t have different 
outputs for the same input.
Q: Is the maximum of the function 
the maximum of the range?
A: Yes. But the tricky thing is you can’t 
necessarily get those values from plugging 
in the low and high values for the domain 
to find the range.
Q: Why not?
A: Because if your function has any 
kind of a curve in the middle of your 
domain limits, you may miss a maximum or 
a minimum for the function.  
For example, if the vertex of a parabola 
was between the two points for your 
domain, the maximum range for that 
function would be based on a value 
between your domain’s limits, not at one 
extreme or the other.
Q: This function thing has a lot of 
rules...
A: The definition of a function was 
created by mathematicians, to make sure 
everybody’s consistent with what they’re 
talking about. That’s important so that 
everyone gets the same results.
Q: Are all functions relations?
A: Yes. Since functions have a domain 
and a range and represent a set of ordered 
pairs, they’re a relation. 
It doesn’t work the other way, though. A 
relation does not have to have a one 
output to one input requirement, so it isn’t 
necessarily a function.
Q: Why would you use a relation?
A: It’s a math way to tie numbers 
together that may not have an easy 
pattern. Think about statistics; if you were 
keeping track of housing data, you’d just 
need an address and a price. It really 
wouldn’t matter what order they were in or 
how much they each cost. 
A function is 
always a relation, 
but relations 
are not always 
functions.

I’m totally confused. What does a relation have to do with anything? 
We were working with functions, and then these things showed up.
What about equations? That’s what we’ve 
been doing for ages, and now they’re gone.
Huh... but what about functions? Are they 
equations or not?
...
I think I get relations. They are just any set of 
ordered pairs. Super general.
Same deal as before, though, right? If an equation follows 
those same rules, one input to one output, it’s a function.
Oh! An equation is also a relation, right?
What?!
Right. There’s all these rules about what makes up a function, 
but a relation just has to be any set of ordered pairs.
They’re not gone! Remember, an equation is just a way to 
write an infinite number of ordered pairs. They have a pattern.
The definition of a function is a relation with one output for 
each input. That’s a set of ordered pairs that follow some rules.
Not really, they’ve always been there.
Must be, because it’s a group of ordered pairs.
They can be, but they don’t have to be.
Yeah.

A function MUST be a relation and MAY be an equation.
Functions are very specific. They have to be a set of ordered pairs, 
and that makes them a relation, too. But not all sets of ordered pairs 
can be expressed as an equation. 
 
An equation in two variables MUST be a relation and 
MAY be a function.
Since an equation is a list of an infinite number of points, that 
means all equations are relations. But functions still have that special 
one-input-to-one-output rule, something not required by equations. 
So not all equations are functions.
 
Relations, linear equations, and functions all have a 
domain and a range.
The domain is the valid input values, and the range is the valid 
output values. The domain and range may be infinite, but they 
always exist.
 
Relations, linear equations, and functions are all sets of 
ordered pairs.
An equation is just a set of (x, y) points if you graph it. The same is 
true for functions and relations, although the ordered pairs don’t have 
to connect for functions and relations. 
 
Relations, equations, and functions 
all go TOGETHER
These three terms are just different ways to characterize a group 
of ordered pairs. That’s a lot to keep up with, so let’s take a step 
back and look at all three terms. How do they relate? How are 
they the same? When are they different?
Since some functions can be written as an 
equation, how do you think you work with 
functions? Can you graph them and solve them?

Constraints on functions allow 
you to be more realistic in the 
way math represents the world.
Head First: Hi function! We’ve been learning 
a lot about you lately.
Function: Thanks, that’s very flattering.
Head First: But what everyone wants to hear 
about you, is, how do people work with you? 
Just like a plain equation?
Function: In some ways, yes. If I happen to 
also be an equation, you can solve me for values 
in the same way you do with an equation.
Head First: So if we set f(x) = 0 that’s ok?
Function: Yes. That way you can solve for the 
zeroes of the function.
Head First: What about graphing?
Function: Again, if I’m written as an equation 
with a domain and range, you can graph me in 
the much the same way as you would a regular 
equation. But you have to show the constraints 
on the graph.
Head First: Oh, I see, so we should only graph 
the values where you’re valid, over your domain, 
for example.
Function: Right. So if my domain goes from 
-1 to 10, then the graph for me should also only 
go from -1 to 10.
Head First: So really, if you’re written as an 
equation, we can just treat you the same as 
equations?
Function: Yes and no. You can, as long as 
whatever you’re doing is within my domain and 
range. Don’t go drawing a graph that goes too 
far, or solving me for values that aren’t in my 
domain. If you do that, it won’t work.
Head First: So you’re more constrained than 
an equation?
Function: Yes, but I prefer to call it realistic. 
The world has limits, and so do I. It means 
that with me, you can work with more realistic 
situations.
Head First: Thanks. Now we have a much 
better idea of how to work with you...

we graphed inequalities.
Just think of graphing a function as graphing an equation, with a twist.
Graph the basic equation on a scale of f(x) vs. x scale.
Just substitute the f(x) values for y on a typical Cartesian plane, and 
go ahead and graph your function. So you’ll usually have an x axis,

Q: How can I figure out the domain of my function?
A: It depends upon how the function is presented. If it’s 
given as an equation in a problem, analyze the problem 
situation and see what limits there are. If the function is a set 
of ordered pairs, the domain can be read directly from the 
points presented.
Q: How do I find the range of my function?
A: The best, easiest way is to graph the function and 
then read the range points off your graph. Why? Because if 
anything weird happens to the equation (or with the points) 
between the boundaries of the domain, you’ll see it.
Q: Can I just evaluate the function for the upper and 
lower values for the domain and get the range?
A: Sometimes, but not always. This really only works if you 
have a line with a positive slope. If you have a quadratic, with 
the vertex between the boundary points, that won’t work at all. 
Unless you are positive that you know exactly what is going 
on with an equation or a relation presented, it’s best to graph 
your relation and then determine the range.
Q: What’s the difference between the range and the 
maximum and minimum values?
A: Good question. The range is all the f(x) values the 
equation can take on. The maximum and minimum values for 
the function are the boundary values...  but just those values.
Q: How can you tell if an equation is a function?
A: An equation is a function if and only if for each input 
there is a single output. That means for each x, there is only 
one f(x) value. If you think about it, there’s a way to see it on 
a graph, too... but more on that later.

Graphing functions is similar to 
graphing equations.

a solid point for an “or equal to” 
inequality, and an open point for just

Jot down some ideas of how you could check to see if the relation 
between seats (s) and customer IDs (c) a function.
In a function, we can only have one f(x) for every x, and that’s 
what we want here. We don’t want any duplicate f(x) values, 
because that would mean two customer IDs are associated with 
the same seat. Not good!
There should be a one-
to-one mapping here. One 
seat produces a SINGLE 
customer ID, no more.

Graphing reveals the nature of a relation
The difference between having the seat assignments right and wrong  is 
exactly the same as the difference between a relation and a function. If 
the seating assignments are one input to one output, then everybody has 
somewhere to go... and that’s a function. If not, there are going to be fist 
fights over a relation that should have been a function, but wasn’t!
Let’s downshift and examine the difference in the graphs of two sets of 
ordered pairs; one that’s just a relation and one that is actually a function.

Two f(x) values for one x... that’s like two y 
values for the same x, right? Sort of like a vertical 
line?
A vertical line is not a function!
A function can’t have more than f(x) for any x. That’s 
like saying for a given x value, there can’t be two points 
lined up vertically:
(1,2)
(2,5)
(-1, -2)
(1,2)
(2,5)
(1, 4)
You can move this 
line anywhere... 
and it should 
never touch TWO 
points at once.
For this one x value, 
there are TWO f(x) 
values... this is NOT 
a function.

Functions pass the vertical line test
This whole “looking at the graph” thing is called the vertical line 
test. It’s based on the fact that if you have two points that are vertically 
stacked, anywhere on a  graph, then that graph is NOT a function. 
So if a vertical line passes through two points on the graph, it’s NOT a 
function. That’s it. To test a graph, you can use a ruler, your eyeball, or 
run the edge of a piece of paper over the graph to see if it’s a function.

A graph allows you to use the 
vertical line test and see if it’s a 
function.
A graph shows the 

domain of a 
function or relation.
A graph also shows the 

range of a 
function or relation.
A graph can provide the 

zeroes of an 
equation or a function.
Q: So, should I always graph a function?
A: It depends upon what you’re after. A graph of a function, 
equation, or relation, is the best way to visually look at the 
situation and it does give you valuable information, but there are 
some limits.  
You are limited to what you can actually read from the graph. If 
there are decimals involved, or the scale of your graph is large, it 
can be difficult to read values.  
Creating a graph takes time. If you are in a test situation and 
you’re only after a specific value, then just evaluate the function 
for your specific value, and move on.
Q: Can you really just treat functions like equations?
A: It’s a really good starting point. If a function is represented 
as an equation, you can solve for the zeroes of the function, and 
then graph the function.  
The only things to watch are that you limit the graph properly 
(keeping the domain and range in mind) and substitute 0 for f(x). 
Q: Is it always f(x)? Can it be, like, f(t) or something?
A: Sure! It’s typically f(x), but that’s not required. The format 
is really what you’re looking for; it can be r(q) or g(t) too. r(q) 
indicates r is a function of q, for example. The axes on any graph 
will need to be adjusted, but other than that, everything else 
would be the same.
Q: Functions seem like more work than just equations. 
You’ve got to keep up with domains and ranges. So why are 
they so much better?
A: Better is a pretty subjective word. The thing is, functions are 
just more realistic in most cases. The real world has limits, and 
with functions you can easily communicate what those limits are 
and see them on a graph. That’s a helpful thing.

What’s going on? During the sound check 
we had VIPs showing up with free tickets. 
What’s the deal with them?
The second show is starting, and now there are 
free tickets? How does that change things?
After running back to check the fine print, there was a clause in 
the contract that you (and Pajama Death) missed!
Apparently, the network can issue 350 free tickets per show to 
VIPs. It makes the audience look cooler... or so they think.
What does that mean for 
Pajama Death’s income?
The FIRST 350 tickets are always free!
Wow, this complicates things. So now, there are still 1,511 possible 
seats. But for each show, the first 350 seats are given away, no charge 
(and no revenue for Pajama Death). Then, the rest of the seats are 
sold at the normal rate. So we’ve got something like this:
0
350
x
#
#
20, 000
100
f
x
x =

^ h
This is fine - the domain is 
still in terms of x, so the 
function is too
0

For the first 350 seats, there’s 
no revenue. So this domain 
changes, and so does the 
function output for that domain.
$ =

Per show, how 
much money will 
they make now?
1511 Seats
Tickets are $100 a 
seat, but the first 
350 are FREE
Still $20, 000 in 
ad revenue
VIPs mess up the numbers
No matter how many 
people come, if there are 
less than 351 tickets that 
go out, the revenue is just 
ad revenue: $20,000.

But... what about the REST of the tickets?
The tickets that are sold after the VIP’s are handled are still $100 a piece. 
That means the equation is almost the same as before... but only after those 
first 350 tickets are gone.
So that throws in a new wrinkle. Revenue is $100 per ticket, but only for 
tickets 351 and up. We’ve got to account for that:

those all go for free now.

The domain changes, too. This 
whole equation ONLY works for 
tickets 351 to 1511.
One function, two parts = real life
These functions can be treated together, as long as you keep track of 
where things are happening. When you have a situation like this, 
where the function needs to have different values over different parts of 
the domain, is called a piecewise defined function. We show this as 
one big function, with different domains, like this:
f
20, 000

20, 000

This bracket means that you have to 
consider the equations together.
Each domain is written next to the 
equation the domain applies to.
So now we’ve got two different functions, each with a separate equation 
and domain. So how do we show that mathematically?
How do you evaluate a piecewise defined 
function? You can’t figure out Pajama Death’s 
income until you know how to do that...
This is the 
updated equation.
So this function behaves differently 
based on the input domain.

408    Chapter 10
Use the function piece you NEED
This is another case where it’s pretty important to keep in mind 
what your function represents. In the real world, you have to 
consider an entire situation, and with piecewise functions, the 
domain is the key. Since you have different equations applying to 
different inputs (in this case, x values), you just need to determine 
which equation applies to the situation you’re working on..
Evaluate only the portion of the function 
that applies to the domain.
Use the correct equation, evaluate, and use or plot your 
answer. Any other pieces of the function don’t apply!
2
After you have a value to evaluate, 
determine where the value falls in your 
function’s domain.
1
Graph piecewise functions just like “normal” functions!
Graphing is much like it was for regular functions. You just graph the 
equation that applies, over the domain where it applies. So you’ll have a 
different section of your graph for each piece of the function... and that’s 
okay. That’s why the function’s called piecewise in the first place.
The conventions for the points at the end of the domain are the same: solid 
circles and open circles, depending on the type of inequality.
To evaluate a piecewise function
What happens if you need to evaluate the function for a number? 
You just see what domain that number falls in, and use the matching 
equation to evaluate for that value. It goes like this:

Piecewise functions are just a series of functions 
grouped together.
The domains typically 

don’t overlap.
The graphing rules for functions 

don’t change.
To evaluate a piecewise function, just 

determine 
the domain that applies and evaluate the portion 
of the function that applies.
Piecewise functions allow you to express that 

different things are happening at different times.

exercise solution
0 < x < 350
351 < x < 1511
This part is just a straight line!
f(x) = 20000 + 100x - 35000
f(x) = 100x - 15000
f(351) = 100(351) -15000 = 20100
f(1511) = 100(1511) -15000 = 136100
Simplify the expression and 
get it into an easier format.
(351, 20100)
(1511, 136100)
The first part is the

Both domain boundaries are solid points 
because these are less than or equal to.

CHAPTER 10
This chapter was all about functions. 
Find the domain of a function.
When presented with an equation that’s also 
a function, you can figure out the domain by 
understanding the equation. Watch for division by 0, 
or cases where a negative root could happen. If it’s 
a line, it goes on forever; if it’s a parabola it only 
covers part of the Cartesian plane and that can limit 
the domain. Graphing may help.
Find the range of a 
function/graph the function.
The best way to go about finding the range is to 
graph. There are some cases (like linear equations) 
where you can easily tell what the range will be - 
but typically graphing is the way to go. Once you 
know the domain, it’s just a matter of cutting 
off the graph and interpreting what’s left.
Solve for the zeroes of the 
function.
You already know how to do that! Simply set 
f(x)=0 and solve the remaining expression for 
x. It’s exactly the same rules as when working 
with equations; inverse operations, FOIL, the 
quadratic equation, the whole thing. The solution 
is the value for x that makes the function true.
If you have a graph and you can read the value 
where f(x) = 0, you can even read it straight 
off the graph!
Evaluate the function.
This just means that you are given an input and they 
are looking for the output. The hardest part about 
this question is understanding what it’s asking! 
Working with piecewise functions.
Piecewise functions are just different functions 
grouped together that apply over different parts of 
the domain. The important thing to remember is to 
work with each piece separately.

That’ll be really helpful. Let’s do it...
IM Chat: Car Payments 
What are the algebraic unknowns you’ll need to deal with?
What kinds of things are going to control the costs? (What are things going to be “in terms of”?)
Your job was to write down some of the things Max has to think 
about when it comes to buying a car. Here's what we wrote down...
We’re going to have to deal with the cost of the car, 
car insurance, car loan rates, how much money Max can put down, and how long he wants to take a loan for.
Some of the costs will depend on how much the car is (insurance, how much he pays in interest on the loan, etc.), 
what goes into a car payment?
and some cost will depend on time, like how long he takes his loan for, and how fast he can pay things off.

There are a lot of things that go into buying a car, but most 
of these depend on how much the car costs, right?
That’s right. Ok, so his savings has to be 9 months times whatever his monthly 
payment is, plus his down payment. We can write that as an equation like this: 
      savings = down payment + 9 (monthly payment) 
Then we just solve for the monthly payment
Hmm... if we need to limit the values that work, we need 
to use a function, right?
...
And don’t forget that Max has 9 months of school left before he even gets a job!
Oh wait! If we have it as a function, then we can graph it, right?
Yeah, and that’s going to depend on how much of a down payment 
Max can put together. Most dealerships require at least $1000.
Hmm, that’s tough. Since he doesn’t have a job, his down 
payment and monthly payments have to come from savings.
Yeah. We have to write this as a function and limit the domain and range.
Yup! And that will show us down payments versus monthly payments.
Well, it’s tricker than that. The dealership says we have to have at least $1000 down, 
and the payments obviously can’t be negative. So it’s not just a simple equation.

0 ≤ m ≤ 700
1000 ≤ d(m) ≤ 7300
- 7300 + 7300 - d(m) = 9(m) -7300
We want d(m) in terms of months, so let's isolate d(m) 
and think in terms of the down payment.
You could also subtract 9m from both sides 
to get d(m) by itself. Either approach 
works just fine... it's up to you.
The monthly payment has 
to be 0 or more.
For the upper boundary, the most that Max will have 
available is $ 7300- $1000, the minimum down payment. 
So that's $6300. Take that and divide over 9 months, and 
his maximum monthly payment is $700/month.
The down payment has to be at least $1000, 
and less than Max's total savings.
What does this graph really mean? 
It’s showing that the higher the 
down payment, the smaller the 
available monthly payment. 
If Max puts $1000 down, that 
means that he’ll have $700 a 
month available for payments. And 
that will max out how much he can 
spend on a car. 
This is the biggest

IM Chat: Principle and Interest

So we need to worry about that loan. The total loan is going to be the 
principle he borrows plus the interest they charge him. Something like this: 
         principle + interest = total loan
...
Nice! So $700 a month for payments. We can work with that.
That's still pretty good. Hello, new wheels.
Oh, wait. We forgot about car insurance. He’s required to have that. I made a 
few calls. We should assume $150 a month. If we subtract $150 a month from his 
$700 payment, that means he can actually afford $550 a month in payments. 
Whoa, hang on. We haven't talked about interest yet. We know 
what Max can pay each month, but not all that money goes to his 
car... he's got to pay a bank interest to borrow money.
Ok, and from Max’s perspective, he needs to pay it off by the monthly 
payments times the number of payments he’s going to make, like this: 
           total loan = monthly payment x number of payments
Right, so $550 is spread out over interest and the principle. We 
need to figure out what kind of loan he can work with. Some of these 
questionable dealers are charging ridiculous interest rates.
Kristina
That’s right. Banks charge interest on the principle—how much 
you borrow. So Max can pay $550 a month, but it's not all actually 
paying for his car, right?

Calculate interest from your interest rate  
and the principle amount you're borrowing
We know what terms the bank offers: 3 years (36 months), 4 years (48 months), 
and 5 years (60 months). And we know the interest rates from each of those 
terms. What we need for our equation, though, is the amount of interest. So 
how can we get that?

Q: Why is the interest equation so complicated?
A: The equation that we’re using for interest is a standard 
equation for figuring out simple interest. It's actually not that 
complicated, although the unusual letters and terms do make it look a 
bit trickier at first glance. 
Q: How does that interest equation really work?
A: This equation: 
is actually fairly simple. It states that the total interest of the loan is 
the interest rate times the amount borrowed, multiplied by the time 
the money is borrowed over. 
The lesson here? Two things really drive up the cost of a loan: how 
much your interest rate is, and how long you borrow the money for.
Q: When I figured out the interest, it was more for the five 
year loan, but the monthly payment was lower. Why is that?
A: With the way the loan works, the time factor is a bigger 
influence than the interest rate. Adding a year onto the loan adds 12 
more payments. So there's a lot more interest, but it's spread out 
over 12 extra months. The end result is a smaller monthly payment. 
It’s worth noting in the long term, a longer loan will make the car cost 
quite a bit more. A shorter loan would mean less interest and would 
cost Max less overall. Shorter is better, if you can afford it.

IM Chat: Cars Depreciate
Kristina
Exactly. So, what this "salesman" is trying to sell is 
called gap insurance. It covers the gap between what a 
car is worth and what is still owed to the bank.
John
...
Jane
This guy gives me the heebee-jeebees. What’s this 
gap insurance he’s talking about?
Jane
Wow, seriously? So Max could end up owing the bank more money?
Kristina
Well, you know how cars depreciate right away? The 
problem is that cars depreciate really quickly at the 
beginning and end up being worth less than you owe.
John
Well, Max won't really end up owing more, his car is just worth a lot less. 
It works like this: say he borrows the $28,800 that he needs to buy the car 
($24,000 plus interest). Well, as soon as he drives off the lot, the car is 
worth about $20,000 because of depreciation.
Jane
Wow, he’d still owe the bank $8,800 and 
not have a car anymore?
Jane
But that's one more thing to pay for, isn't 
it? Can Max even afford that? Is it worth it?
Kristina
So if he’s in an accident on his way home from the dealer, 
then he gets $20,000 back from the insurance company, since 
that’s what his car’s worth. But he'll still owe the bank the entire 
$28,800? That seems pretty unfair...

Bank Balance

Depreciation is a sad fact of life
But the bank still gets their money
Things get old fast... especially cars. Tires, brakes, fluids, and wear on 
the engine happen every mile that you drive. That’s why used cars are 
less expensive than new cars. 
Depreciation is the term that is used to describe exactly how much 
value a car has lost. The depreciated value is the value of the car 
minus the depreciation. In other words, it's what the car is worth at a 
particular moment in time.
Unfortunately, cars lose about 20% of their value as soon as you drive 
them off the lot. Then they lose their remaining value over about 10 
years, at which point they’re basically worthless. 
The value of the car, then, is actually dropping faster than you're 
paying the bank. So there's a gap between what you owe the bank, and 
what your car is worth:
Your amount owed 
goes down at a 
fixed rate as 
you pay the bank 
each month.
Your car is usually 
worth less than 
you actually owe, 
though.
THE GAP
calculate what the car is worth
Suppose Max got a bank statement for his 
car... this might be what it'd look like.
Max's car is worth only 
$20,000 once he drives it 
off the lot.
Max owes the bank $24,000 
plus $4,800 in interest.
This is a piecewise function! 
Forgot what that means? Check 
back in Chapter 10 for details.
There's a gap... the 
difference between your 
car's value and what you 
owe the bank.

Domain:
v(t) = 25000 - 0.2(25000)t
v(t) = 28800 - 480t
v(t) = 25000 - 5000t
v(t) = 20000 - 166t
= 25000 - 0.2(25000) = 20000
This means loan value 
as a function of time
This number is the total cost of the loan: 
principle plus the interest we figured out earlier.
Use minus because each payment is 
lowering what you owe.
480 a month, times t, the 
number of months.
0 ≤ t ≤ 60
2 ≤ t ≤ 60
0 ≤ t < 1
The initial value 
of the car
Piece one of 
the function
less the depreciation
This is 20% of the initial 
car value, times t.
Piece two of 
the function
First, figure out what the car is 
worth after the initial drop.
The new initial value
This is still the value of the car 
over time, just for t > 1.
We know the car's going to drop 
over 10 years. Average that out as 
a 10% per year drop
Divide by 12 to get from a 
yearly rate to a monthly rate.
This is true for the rest of the 
life of the loan: 60 months.
The domain for this function starts when Max 
buys his car, and goes for 60 months (five 
years), the term of his loan.
v(t) = 20000 -      (20000)t

You don't need to GUESS with Algebra
Max definitely needs some type of gap insurance to cover him while 
his car is worth less than he owes. But which option? 1 or 2?
Between the graph, the functions, and your mad Algebra skills, 
you can figure this out. You need to determine Max’s maximum 
potential risk at any time, and how much the different gap insurance 
options cost. You also need to think about his monthly budget and 
the overall cost of each gap insurance option.
... but remember to keep the context of 
the problem in mind
First, we need to know how much Max can afford in 
additional premiums on top of his car payment and 
existing insurance. But that's not the only thing Max 
needs to worry about.
Here’s what we need to do:
Figure out what Max can afford.
Determine Max's leftover balance from his initial purchase and 
make sure he can afford either premium for gap insurance.
1
Evaluate Option #1.
Figure out the worst case gap over the first 18 months (that’s Max’s 
risk), and the total premium that he’ll pay for this option's coverage. 
2
Evaluate option #2.
Figure out the worst case between 18 months and 3 years (that’s 
the additional risk that would be covered with option 2), and the 
total in premiums he’d pay over three years for option 2. 
3
Pick the wisest option.
Using the new information and the graph of the gap, what’s the 
smart plan? Which option should Max choose?
4
pick the right coverage
Gap Insurance - Terms and Premiums
Option #1
18 months of coverage @ $20 per month
Option #2

The premium is $20 a month, which Max can definitely afford.
So, for $360, Max covers a maximum possible risk of $8000.
The worst gap between 18 months and 3 years is about $2000. 
Premiums paid = 36(60) = $2160
Premiums paid = 18(20) = $360
The premium is $60 a month, so Max can afford that, too.
For a total of $2160, Max would cover the same $8000 risk as 
Option #2 is not worth it! Max would have to pay over $1440 extra (option 2 cost - option 1 
cost) to cover an additional risk of $2000. So his extra premiums end up only potentially saving 
him $600! Better to take option 1 and drive carefully around month 19 and 20!
option 1, but he'd also cover a risk of $2000 that would occur after option 1's plan expired.
$480 < $550
= 480

(24,000 + 4, 800)
Sweet! It works! Max can afford 
his car if he takes the longest 
loan and have $70 leftover..
We figured this out way back 
on page 432 when Max was 
picking a loan.
The worst gap in the first 18 months comes at the initial dip - it looks like about $8,000.

Monthly Premium
Total option 1 premiums
Maximum risk for Max

Total option 2 premiums
The overall maximum risk is still 
$8000 in the first few months. 
But the maximum risk not covered 
by option 1 is $2000, around 
month 18 or 19.

Distributing the 
exponent
What’s going on here? It’s really a matter of cancelling things out... here’s a simple 
example, where you can see the cancelling in action:
Using the division of 
exponential term rules
Since both approaches are both 
valid, the answers are the same.
A negative exponent means that you divide one by the exponential term, with its exponent stripped 
of its negative sign. Negative exponents are a great way to get rid of fractions.  Any fraction can be 
rewritten as a negative exponent, and you can work with it the same way you would work with any 
other exponent.
In general:
Take this 
exponential 
term...
...and put 
it as a 
denominator, 
without the 
negative sign.

#2 Table of values for graphing
We mentioned them a couple of times, and even showed one, but what exactly is 
a table of values? 
A table of values is a table that is set up with both of the variables that are 
in an equation and allows you to easily keep track of the results for different 
substitutions. It’s another way to keep track of points for graphing.  For lines, it’s 
not typically necessary because you only need two points, but for other shapes...

-(52) + 10(5) +75
This is from chapter 9.  This table 
shows the equation, the x values, and 
the resulting h values.
You can set one of these up for any equation you’re graphing, if 
you think it will help you keep track of what’s going on. 
Since the 
equation is 
quadratic, it’ll 
be a parabola.

You’ve learned a lot about how to manipulate and solve equations, but we didn’t get to cover 
how you handle an equation when there’s an absolute value in there.
You know how to handle the absolute value of a number, but what if you have a variable 
inside the absolute value signs that you want to isolate? When you have an equation with an 
absolute value, even though there is only one unknown, there are two solutions.

This must be true because 
you strip the number of it’s 
sign with the absolute value.
What happens if there’s more than one term inside the absolute value signs? If that 
happens, you have to treat the whole quantity inside the absolute value as an unknown, 
and isolate it before you can do anything else.  
You have to treat the 
“x + 3” part as an 
unknown and isolate it.

#4 Calculators
Generally, the work in this book can be completed by hand (if you have enough paper). If you 
used a calculator, it didn’t need to be anything past a basic calculator with exponents.
There are a lot of calculators out there that can graph, solve equations, and plug and chug the 
quadratic formula for you. For now:
Don’t use a calculator to solve your equations!
The point of this book and the material in it is to learn how to manipulate the first level of 
equations while understanding what is going on.  If you simply plug things into a calculator, 
what you’ve really understood is how to work your calculator!
As you progress in math, you’ll need 
to use technology more - but not yet!
#5 More practice, especially for factoring
The best way to get good at all of this work is to practice it more. Working through the 
exercises in this book is a great start, but you should pull out your classroom textbook and 
work on those problems, too.  
This book describes all of the principles you’ll need to work in most Algebra I textbooks, 
and the more you work on them, the better you’ll get. 
Factoring, in particular, is a skill that you will be able to do much faster the more you do it.

pre-algebra review
How do you work with negative numbers?
Operations with negative numbers are similar to operations with positive numbers; you just have to 
keep track of the sign of the numbers that you’re dealing with. The first thing to understand is how the 
negative and positive numbers relate to each other. The number line will help with this.
The number line
-3 < 1
-3 is to the left 
of 1, so -3 is less 
than 1.
To determine the relationship between integers, plot both numbers on a number line. The number farthest to 
the left is always less. That’s because the left side of the number line is headed off to negative infinity, a very, 
very small number.
The number farthest to the right is always the larger number. Since as you go farther to the right on the 
number line, you are closer and closer to positive infinity—a huge number.  Looking at -3 and 1 on the 
number line, it’s clear that -3 is less than 1 since it’s farther to the left. 
Use the number line above to plot the relationships and fill in less 
than or greater than signs.

The negative version of a number will

If two numbers are of the same sign and

Addition and subtraction of integers
You’ve probably been adding positive numbers for ages, so you have no problem with 
that. The good news is that when you’re working with numbers of the same sign, there 
are some simple rules to follow.  
Adding two positive numbers is a positive number.
Nothing’s changed here. They just keep going up!
1
Adding two negative numbers is a negative number.
With two negative numbers, just add the number part first and put a 
negative sign in front of it; that’s it.
2
Rules for adding & subtracting mixed integers.
Move left on the number line for negative numbers, move right for 
positive numbers.
3
Did you notice that there’s no “subtracting positive numbers” on that list? Now that 
you’re working with integers, the line between addition and subtraction gets a bit murky.  
Subtracting a number is the same thing as adding a negative number. For example, 2-3 is 
the same as 2 + (-3).
How do you know? To actually perform the operation, you can work with the number 
line. The rules are simple: for every negative number (or subtraction), move left on the 
number line, and for every positive number (or addition), go to the right.

Multiplication and division of integers
To multiply and divide integers, you use the same operations as with regular positive 
numbers, with a few simple rules about how you work with the signs. When you come 
across an integer multiplication problem, first figure out the number piece:
2
3
?

This is the 
original problem.
First just do the 
number part.
And a sign (a positive 
or a negative)
This is what you need to 
learn the rules about.
The rules for integer signs - multiplication and division
Now that you know where you need the rules, here they are. Remember, you just 
carry out the multiplication (or division) as you would for positive numbers, and then 
add the sign in front to get your answer.
A positive number multiplied or divided by a positive 
number is a positive number.
So, you figure out the number part, and that’s it.
1
A negative number multiplied or divided by a negative 
number is a positive number.
The two negative signs cancel each other out.
2
A negative number multiplied or divided by a positive 
number is a negative number.
So, if the numbers are mixed, the negative sign carries.
3
So now let’s add a sign to 
that problem:

the numbers end up positive. Here’s what it looks like:

This is the

The absolute value sign means 
“take the sign off of this 
number.”
How do you treat the absolute value sign and the numbers inside it? The absolute value sign acts like 
parentheses; you have to do what’s inside it first and then take off the sign. So if it shows up in an expression 
you’re working with, you have to handle it before moving on. 
If you think of the absolute value sign as a brick wall, that might help.

What absolute value means
Absolute value really means the distance between a number and zero on the number 
line. It’s important in cases where you’re more interested in difference than direction. 
The number alone tells you how far you’ll travel, and the sign tells you the direction 
you’ll move in—to the left of zero, if the sign is negative, or to the right of zero, if the 
sign is positive. 
Absolute value means caring about the distance, not the sign.

Absolute value - The absolute value of a number is 
the value of the number without its sign. It is the 
distance of the number from zero on the number line.

Q: What is absolute value used for in the real world?
A: Distance is, at its core, just absolute value. It’s the answer to 
“How far are you going?” It doesn’t matter which way, so you’re the 
distance you give will always be positive—an absolute value. 
 
Another example is temperature change. Since temperatures are 
measured in terms of above and below zero, you may need to know 
how much the temperature needs to be raised. If you start at below 
zero and are going above zero (say, from -10 degrees to +32), you 
need the absolute value of those numbers added together, not just 
numbers themselves.
Q: Isn’t the number line a little juvenile?
A: No, the number line is a great, easy way to keep track of what’s 
going on when you’re adding positive and negative numbers. Don’t 
feel like you need to use something complicated just because you’re 
getting ready for Algebra!
Q: What if we have three integers that are multiplied 
together? Which sign wins?
A: If you have a string of integers multiplied together, here’s the 
deal: If it’s all positive, the answer’s positive. If you have an even 
number of negative signs, then the answer is positive. If you have an 
odd number of negative signs, the answer is negative.
Q: Zero is an integer, too?
A: It sure is. It’s included because the integers are really whole 
numbers, so you need to keep the zero. Stay tuned, later in the 
chapter, we’ll learn about zero and how it works. 
Q: What if my integers get really big? Then the number line 
won’t work as well?
A: Yes and no. You might not be able to count out your answer, 
that’s true, but you could draw a number line with the tick marks 
meaning 10’s, for example. 
Q: Is subtraction done?
A: It’s just a matter of perspective, really. Subtraction and addition 
of a negative are the same thing. That being said, it doesn’t really 
matter what you call them; you do the same thing to deal with the 
operation. 
 
The big take away from this is that you can put the negative inside 
the parentheses and work with it that way if it’s easier in any given 
situation.

{1, 2, 3, ...}
Counting Numbers:
The curly braces mean “a 
mathematical set.”
This means “more in this direction 
like this” (4, 5, 6, etc.).
The numbers listed are included 
in the set and also establish the 
pattern for the rest of the set.
The number sets
In mathematics, there is a typical notation for sets of numbers. Here’s what 
it looks like:
The counting numbers are the smallest set. They’re just the numbers that you use to count things. It’s also the first set 
of numbers that you work with when you’re learning about math.
Whole Numbers:
{0,1, 2, 3, ...}
Just the counting 
numbers with zero added
The whole numbers are just the counting numbers and zero. You’ll need zero to indicate there’s nothing of something.
{Any number a/b}
Rational Numbers:
Rational numbers are a bit more complicated. Any number that can be written as a fraction is a rational number. Since 
counting and whole numbers (like 2) can be written as a whole number divided by 1 (like 2/1), they’re rational, too, 
just like all of the integers. This number set is helpful when we work with fractions. Decimals that can be converted to 
fractions are also rational. 
{Any number that can’t 
be written as a fraction}
Irrational Numbers:
Irrational numbers are numbers that can’t be fractions. You’ll see them more and more as you get into geometry and 
the real world, but there are numbers that go on and on—non-repeating and non-terminating decimals. There are 
square roots that go on forever, and there’s pi, the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle.
{All of them so far}
Real Numbers:
Real numbers are just the set that encompasses all of the numbers, both rational and irrational. Since a rational number 
can’t be irrational, but they’re both numbers that can exist in the world, this set includes all of them.
Integers:
{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 , 2, 3, ...}

It’s important to be able to communicate a piece of a whole thing, and there are three ways

hundreds, decimals have places, too.

The size of the piece of the thing.
The numbers to the right of the decimal point communicate that size in 
pre-determined pieces. For example, if a number is in the tenths place, it 
is that many tenths. 
2
How decimals communicate
Just by having the format of a decimal, you can tell two big things 
about the number.
If you need to deal with parts, 
and you need to deal with a 
calculator, you’re probably going 
to need decimals.

Addition and subtraction with decimals
Addition and subtraction with decimals are almost exactly the same as addition 
and subtraction with whole numbers, but you must line up the decimal 
points.  Just like with whole numbers, with decimals, you have to add the right 
place, so tenths must be added to tenths, hundredths to hundredths, etc. The 
way to do that is to make sure that the decimal points line up.

together (the addends).

Where does the decimal go? 
Since they’re not lined up, you 
can’t tell...
If you just add 
up the numbers on 
the right, you’re 
adding tenths to 
hundredths.
Carrying across columns is the same as it is with whole numbers.
Borrowing from other columns is the same, too.
Subtraction works the same as addition, just line up the decimal 
points, and you’ll be ok. 
When you add and subtract 
decimals you must line up the 
decimal points.

Decimal multiplication
Multiplying decimals is almost the same as multiplying whole numbers; however, there is a 
twist at the end. You can set up a decimal multiplication problem exactly the same way you 
would whole numbers: line the numbers up on the right, and start multiplying. After you’ve 
multiplied the first number by each digit of the second number, you can add them up. 
The last step, the one that’s different with decimals, is you need to count the number of places 
to the right of the decimal point in both of the factors, and then put that total number of 
decimal places in the answer.

These are the two ways 
you should be used to 
seeing division.
If you’re dealing with decimals, take regular long division and make the following changes: 
If there’s a decimal point in the divisor, you need to remove it.
If you have a decimal point in the divisor, you need to eliminate it. First, move the 
divisor decimal point to the right as many times as you need to make the divisor a 
whole number. Then, move the decimal point in the dividend the same number of 
places to the right.

If there is a decimal point in the dividend, then put the decimal 
point in the same place in the solution above.
After setting up the problem, just stick the decimal point in the solution right above 
it. If there was no decimal point in the divisor, then divide exactly the same way 
you would with whole numbers.  If you moved the decimal in step one, remember 
to use the new position.

Adjust the decimal points as needed. If 
the divisor has a decimal point, move it to

Remainders don’t exist for you anymore! 
Since you’re working with decimals, you 
can add a zero to the dividend without 
changing any values, and keep on going.  
Just don’t forget to put a zero in your 
solution when you need to add a zero to 
the dividend.

Special decimals
There are a couple of special cases that you need to be prepared for with decimals. Decimal 
division can actually end in three ways: 
Terminating decimals.
The one we just did is a terminating decimal. That means it ends.
1
Repeating decimals. 
These decimals get in a rut. The thirds (1/3, 2/3) are the easiest 
example. Once you start the division, it never ends. There’s a 
convention for writing them:
2
Non-terminating, non-repeating decimals.
These go on forever. You just keep adding zeros and dividing 
numbers. When you start to see that happening, just write what 
you have, and add a note that it doesn’t terminate.

Go ahead and 
try this. It’s 1 
divided by three.
This bar means the 
number after the 
decimal is repeating.
Q: With repeating decimals, will it just 
be one number?
A: Not necessarily. Sometimes it’s several 
numbers that repeat, like 1.234234234.  
 
These numbers are written with a bar on top 
of the entire sequence that repeats: 
 
 
Q: How do I know if it’s a non-
terminating, non-repeating, or just a long 
sequence that repeats?
A: Most of the time, the problem will tell 
you how many decimals to use before you 
decide. For example, it may say, “Only take 
the division out 5 places.” 
Q: How do you use repeating 
decimals? You can’t add them to other 
numbers, right?
A: With repeating decimals and non-
terminating, non-repeating decimals, it’s 
much easier to work with them as fractions.
Q: Why can you just add zeros on the 
end when dividing by decimals?
A: Since the zero comes after the decimal, 
it’s not changing the value of the dividend 
at all. 15.126 has the same value as 
15.12600000. Adding the zero is a trick that 
makes it easier to finish long division.

You’re 100% right!
Decimals and percentages are almost the same thing. Percentages are just 
a convention that we use to work with decimals, primarily those between 
zero and one. 0% is 0, and 100% is 1; everything else is some decimal 
in between. There are a lot of times when you need to talk about some 
consistent piece of something that’s between zero and one—tax rates, 
contribution rates...
Dealing with percentages is easy. Just convert them back to decimals and 
work with them that way.
Saying 5% sounds 
way better than 5 
hundredths.
1% = 1 out of 100 = 0.01
To convert a percent to 
a decimal, just move the 
decimal point two places 
to the left. 
Q: Does it work the other way—going 
from a decimal to a percent?
A: Yes. If you want to convert a decimal to 
a percent, just move the decimal point to the 
right two places. 
 
Q: What if the percent is bigger than 
100?
A: The process stays the same; you 
move the decimal two places to the left. The 
number that you come up with at the end will 
be over one, that’s all. 
Q: Can a percentage be written as a 
fraction?
A:It sure can, and we’ll find out how to 
do it soon. For now, just remember that all 
of these things—decimals, percents and 
fractions— are all ways to work with parts 
of numbers.

Working with percents
With a typical percentage problem, you’re looking for some percent of 
something, like sales tax. In chapter 1, we help Jo buy a game console, 
and when you buy something, you have to pay the taxes:
First let’s deal with sales tax...
The base price is $199.  After that, we need 
to think about taxes.  In Mathopolis, the sales 
tax rate is 5%. Let’s figure out how much we’ll 
have to pay in taxes.
The game 
console is $199.
To find the percent of something, there a three steps.
Figure out the number you are taking the percentage of.
1
199
You need to find the 
percentage of the base 
price, $199.
Convert the percentage to a decimal. You do that my simply 
moving the decimal point in the percent two places to the left.

5 %=0.05
Take out the 
percent sign.
This decimal is there, 
even if it’s not written.
5%
Start with 5%
0
Moving the decimal two places 
means you have to add a zero.
Multiply the decimal to the first number. The value you’ll 
get is the result you’re looking for!

Improper fractions
An improper fraction is one where the numerator is larger than the denominator. 
Since the numerator is larger, the fraction actually represents more than one.
For example, the last fraction in the previous exercise has a denominator of 2, 
which means that the whole is cut into 2 pieces. The numerator of three means 
that there are three pieces of it (more than one total pie).

This number is 
bigger than
this one.

pies cut in two.
Divide to make an improper fraction proper
To convert an improper fraction to a proper fraction, you need to remember that 
the line in the fraction means division.
Sometimes (like with multiplication and division) 
it makes more sense to keep working with the 
improper fraction. But what if you just wanted to 
know how many pies there are? 
2
3
This line means 
division.
Another way to read 
this would be “3 
divided by 2.”
So, do the 
division!

one half of a pie.
Here’s your proper 
fraction (the official 
term is a mixed 
number).
Any remainder of the division just goes 
back over your denominator.  The whole 
number part of the division stays as a 
whole number.

The mixed numbers make things tricky.  You have to make these improper

Whole numbers would just complicate this problem.

This means that you have 
two wholes and one sixth

The reciprocal of a fraction is a fraction with the numerator and denominator 
switched. To divide two fractions using this method, you can multiply by the 
reciprocal instead of cross multiplying.

reciprocals.

no dumb questions
Q: Why do we have to learn fractions? 
Don’t most people use calculators?
A: It’s true that most people use 
calculators. The problem is that when you 
get to funky decimals like repeating decimals, 
for instance, it’s actually way easier to work 
with the fraction. If you need to carry that 
small number through a few steps in Algebra, 
it could get ugly.
Q: How do you know what each 
decimal place is? 10ths, 100ths?
A: That is basic number knowledge, and 
you just have to memorize it. The good 
news is that 0.1 is one tenth, 0.01 is one 
hundredth, and it keeps going up by a factor 
of 10 each time. 
 
Knowing that, it’s easy to convert a decimal 
to a fraction. 
 
 
 
Q: Addition and subtraction of 
decimals are the same as whole 
numbers?
A: Yes if you LINE UP THE DECIMALS. 
Don’t line them up to the right, because then 
you’ll have 100ths added to 10ths, and that 
won’t work. 
Q: How long can I keep adding zeroes 
if I’m dividing?
A: Good question. As long as you want, 
really. If you have a repeating decimal, you’ll 
figure it out pretty fast—probably by the 
hundredths place. Otherwise, keep going 
until you have no remainder or you have 
enough decimal places that you can answer 
your question. That will depend upon the 
context of the problem. 
Q: Percents are really just decimals?
A: That’s right! They were developed so 
we could easily talk about one hundredth of 
a thing. Since that’s also how divide up our 
money, it’s so convenient!
Q: For what do you use improper 
fractions for?
A: They are great for speed. If you 
have several steps to go through with 
multiplication and division of fractions, it’s 
much easier to keep working with the 
improper fraction. If you convert improper 
fractions in the middle of a problem to a 
proper fraction (say, a whole number and 
a fraction), and then you need to multiply, 
you’ll just end up going back again. 
Q: Which is better, cross 
multiplication or using the reciprocal for 
fraction division?
A: It’s a style thing, really. Both of them 
work fine, but for one, you need to rewrite 
the fraction, and for the other, you don’t. It 
may bother you that cross multiplication 
doesn’t involve writing exactly what you’re 
doing. When you write out the reciprocal, the 
math you’re doing is exactly the same thing, 
but the notation is different.

Adding and subtracting fractions
Addition and subtraction of fractions are a bit more complicated than multiplication and 
division.  You can multiply and divide any two fractions without much trouble. To add

Why? Because the answer you are looking for will be in a given denominator, which says 
how many pieces your whole is cut up into.

Equivalent fractions get you matching denominators
You may remember from your times tables that any number times one is itself. This one little fact 
makes it possible to change a denominator without changing the value of the fraction—the size of 
the pie piece that you’re going to get. 
To get an equivalent fraction (say, to add them, since they need the same denominator), you have 
to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number (like 2 over 2). You can do that 
because 2 over 2 is equal to one, so you’re not changing the value of the fraction, just the way it’s 
written.
When you do this to get an equivalent fraction, you find a different way to express the same amount 
of pie. Let’s try it out.

simple, it should be the lowest common denominator.
Lowest common denominator
The smallest 
number...
that all the fractions 
involved could share...
as a 
denominator.
To find the lowest common denominator, you need to find the least common multiple 
of the numbers that are the denominators of your fractions (in our case 3 and 4).  Once 
you’ve done that, then you can figure out how to find the equivalent fractions of each 
addend with the right denominator. 
A multiple of a 
number is the result 
of the original 
number times any 
other number.
Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24...
Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24...
We’re looking for the least common 
multiple, so we’re stopping here, but 
we could go on forever.
These are the multiples that the 
denominators have in common.
When you’re presented with two fractions, and you want the lowest common denominator, just list 
the multiples for each number and choose the smallest one that they share. 
Since we’ve found 12 is our least common multiple, now we can use it as the lowest common 
denominator.  
Least common multiple (LCM) - The lowest 
multiple that numbers have in common.
Lowest common denominator (LCD) -  The lowest 
common multiple of denominators.

Still feel like you can’t add fractions? You’re closer than you think—you just 
need to put it all together. Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) and 
multiply by 1 to get a common denominator. 
Write out the initial problem. If you have a word problem, make 
sure that you know what you’re working with by writing it out first.

Pick this one - it’s the 
least common multiple of 
both numbers.
Determine what version of 1 to use to get both fractions with 
the LCD. You know what denominator you need to get to (12). Now 
you have to figure out what fractional form of 1 to use to get there.

Dividing by one doesn’t change the value
Dividing by one doesn’t change anything either, which means that you can divide a fraction by one 
(in any of its many forms) without changing the size of the piece of pie that you have.
All of this is just another way to express the identity of one. Any number divided by one is 
itself. Now the question is how do you figure out what to divide by?

, really? That’s not very user friendly at all.  
I do not want to be finding LCD’s that big.
We know how to find an equivalent fraction with a 
larger denominator—what about a smaller one? 
It happens pretty often that you get into a situation where your 
LCD is still pretty big, and then your answer is this big fraction. 
When that happens, you just need to divide by one in a way that 
gets you a smaller, more user friendly, but still equivalent, fraction. 
It’s called reducing the fraction.
But why is that ok?

Reduce fractions by dividing by 1
To reduce a fraction, you need to find out the version (or versions ) of 1 that you can divide into 
both the numerator and the denominator. You can do this division as many times as you want to, 
so to get started, you just need to find a common factor for both numbers—any one will do.
You know, doing this 
over and over is boring. Is there 
a way to speed this up?

Reduce this to make 
it more user friendly.
These numbers are both even, so 
you can divide the top and the 
bottom by 2.
That’s better, but if there’s another common 
factor, you need to pull it out too - that way 
the fraction will be completely reduced. 
To completely reduce a fraction, you need to remove all of the common factors from the 
fraction. That means you keep trying to divide out numbers until they’re aren’t any more in 
common. Since 46 and 30 are both even, you know that there’s at least another 2 in there.

You can’t stop reducing the fraction until there aren’t any more common factors. That means 
that either the numerator or the denominator must be prime, or there aren’t any more factors 
in common.

Factor trees can eliminate lots of little steps
There’s an easy way to come up with factors of a number; it’s called a factor 
tree. A factor tree is a table that lists all of the factors, so it’s easier to come up 
with your factor list and then reduce your fractions.
Let’s do 60 
first - it’s a 
little smaller.
60

30
15

3
Write your number.
1
Pick a number to divide 
by first.
If it’s an even number, 2 is 
the way to go. You can usually 
come up with the other number 
off the top of your head.
2
Put the result of the 
division here.
So the two numbers on 
this line can be multiplied 
to get the number above it 
(2x30 = 60).
3
Stop the branch of the 
tree if all that’s left is 
one and the number itself.
Everybody knows that 1 goes 
into everything, so don’t bother. 
This branch is done.
4
Divide your new 
number by two 
if it’s a factor.
Pull this number 
apart too.
5
Repeat until you don’t have 
any branches left.
6
Pick out the prime factors
You may not know how to read it yet, but you now have a list of all of the factors that make up your 
number. The form of the tree tells you one important thing, too. The end of each of the branches are 
the prime factors of the number.
If you list all of the prime factors, it’s called prime factorization, and those are the smallest 
pieces that can be multiplied together to get your big number. Not only that, but multiplying them in 
different combinations will give you all of the factors of the numbers.
Prime factorization of 60: 2, 2, 3, 5
You write both 2’s out because it’s the 
prime factorization, not just the prime 
factors. 
In this form, you can use the 
list of factors as a check 
list to figure out all of the 
factors.

Q: What’s the GCF? I’ve heard it 
before, but I’m not sure what it’s used for.
A: The GCF stands for greatest common 
factor. That is the largest number that can be 
pulled out of two larger numbers.
Q: I’ve heard of using the GCF for 
reducing fractions. How does that work?
A: The GCF is actually used in much the 
same way for reducing fractions as the LCM 
is used for coming up with the LCD. If you 
can list the factors that go into both your 
numerator and denominator, it’s easy to find 
the biggest one.  
 
Once you do that, you can simply divide 
the numerator and denominator by the GCF. 
The problem is, it’s tricky to come up with 
the factor list. The factor tree and the prime 
factorization always work the first time.
Q: What’s the difference between the 
LCD and the LCM?
A: The LCM (lowest common multiple) is 
a numeric property of any two numbers. You 
use the LCM of two numbers as the LCD 
(least common denominator). It’s basically 
the LCM applied to a specific situation—
fractions. 
 
 
Q: Working with fractions seems to be 
much harder than working with decimals. 
Is it worth it?
A: Getting started with fractions is a bit 
trickier than starting with decimals. The thing 
is, once you get the hang of it, fractions can 
actually be faster and easier because they 
tend to stay neater than decimals. 
 
Think about it, working with non-terminating, 
non-repeating decimals would not be pretty.
Q: When do you need to reduce 
fractions?
A: Sometimes you’ll want to do it just 
to make the fractions easier to deal with. 
Working with large denominators gets pretty 
ugly if you need to come up with a LCD and 
add or subtract. 
 
Other times, your problem will ask you to 
reduce the fraction, or you will get an answer 
that just doesn’t make much sense if it’s not 
reduced. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: Why is it called a factor tree?
A: Not really sure, but did you ever think 
that they kinda look like evergreen trees?
Q: What if I can do the factorization in 
my head? Do I still need to do the factor 
tree?
A: Nope, you can skip it (but the tree 
tends to keep you from messing up).
Q: Apparently dividing by one and 
multiplying by one are both important?
A: Very. Working with the identity property 
of one makes all of this fraction manipulation 
possible.

Can I just say, I am so over fractions. 
Is there a way to just convert them to 
decimals? Then I can just deal with them 
that way.
YES! You can convert fractions to decimals.
Now that you have the skills to reduce fractions and change their 
denominators, you’re ready to find out how to convert decimals to fractions 
and back again. And since decimals and percentages are pretty much the 
same thing, you can convert to percentages, too.
Converting from a fraction to a decimal
Converting from a fraction to a decimal is actually very simple. You just do the division. 
We know from converting improper fractions that the line in the middle of the fraction just 
means division. We also know, from decimal division, that you can add as many zeros as you 
need after the decimal to finish the division. If you put those together, you can convert fractions 
to decimals.

Converting decimals to fractions
The key to converting decimals to fractions is the decimal places themselves. Remember that 
0.1 is one tenth? As in, one over ten. So, to convert a decimal, just drop the decimal, put the 
numerals of the decimal in the numerator, and then put a one and the number of zeros for the 
decimal (like, 1000 for thousandths) in the denominator.

Division by Zero doesn’t work
There’s a special case with division: division by zero doesn’t work (and since fractions are 
just division, it’s a fraction problem, too). Mathematically speaking, division by zero 
is undefined. To understand division by zero, it’s best to start off with division by a few 
numbers close to zero. If you move to smaller and smaller numbers, a disturbing trend 
starts appear.

Division by 0 
is undefined.  
That means 
that there is 
no answer.
The closer you get to dividing by zero, the bigger the answer gets.  
If 1/100 gets you 500, imagine 1/1000 or 1/1,000,000! As you 
get closer and closer to zero, you get closer and closer to infinity.  
You just can’t divide by zero—there’s no answer.

Sometimes multiplication takes forever!
What if you wanted to write out an expansion of multiplying the same number over and 
over again? Say you send a chain letter to two people, who then also send it to two people. 
How many people would get it by the third day? 
That sounds like multiplication...

The original two people.
Then, they send it 
to two people each 
(that gives the 2 
times 2).
Those people send it 
to two each (again, 
so then times 2).
This is how many 
people get it on the 
third day.
Is there a shorter way?
Seems like there should be an easier way to write this thing out. It’s pretty easy to mess 
up how many 2’s get written, and you’re just writing the same thing over and over again. 
That’s why we have exponents. An exponent is a notation above a number that means 
“multiply the base by itself this many times.”
If we rewrite the equation we wrote before with an exponent, it would look like this:
2
8
3 =
This is the 
exponent, 3.
This number is called 
the “base.” It’s the 
number that gets 
multiplied.
These equations are 
exactly the same 
thing, just with 
exponent notation.
Now that you have an idea of how exponents work, how many people will have the chain letter 
on Day 4? How about on Day 5?

pre-algebra review
We’ve figured out what happens to the chain letter on the third day.  What if we wanted 
to know about the 4th day, or the 10th day? It’d be helpful to generalize the equation.
We know that each person who gets the letter will send it on to two people—that won’t 
change. What does change is how many days have passed, which is the exponent.
Since each person sends the letter to two other 
people, our base is two.  Each day is basically 
how many 2’s we have—that’s our exponent.
How quickly things spread...
Day 1: 
2 letters...
Day 2: 
2 * 2 = 4 letters
Day 3: 
2 * 2 * 2 = 8 letters
Day 4: 
2 * 2 * 2 * 2= 16 letters

Simplify some exponents. Make sure to write out the whole 
expanded expression first. You’re probably going to need a 
calculator for some of these.
Just because this is a fraction, 
don’t worry - just write it out 
like you do for whole numbers.
Remember, with 
fraction multiplication, 
you just go straight 
across.
Negative numbers don’t 
change anything either, 
just write them out and 
think about it!

Arts and crafts:
If you want to see a real life example of 
exponents in action, go grab a piece of 
paper. Fold it in half. The stack is now two 
sheets thick, right? Nothing exciting yet...
Then fold it in half again, and now it’s four 
sheets thick. One more time - now it’s eight 
sheets thick.
How would you express this as a base and 
an exponent so that if someone told you 
how many times they folded it you’d know 
how many sheets thick the stack was?
