 Red Seal Occupational Standard – Industrial Electrician - 2016 
FOREWORD 
 
The Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship (CCDA) recognizes this Red Seal 
Occupational Standard (RSOS) as the Red Seal standard for the Industrial Electrician trade. 
 
 
Background 
 
The first National Conference on Apprenticeship in Trades and Industries, held in Ottawa in 1952, 
recommended that the federal government be requested to cooperate with provincial and territorial 
apprenticeship committees and officials in preparing analyses of a number of skilled occupations. 
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) sponsors the Red Seal Program, which, under the 
guidance of the CCDA, develops a national occupational standard for each of the Red Seal trades. 
 
Standards have the following objectives: 
 
• 
to describe and group the tasks performed by skilled workers; 
 
• 
to identify which tasks are performed in every province and territory; 
 
• 
to develop instruments for use in the preparation of Interprovincial Red Seal Examinations and 
assessment tools for apprenticeship and certification authorities; 
 
• 
to develop common tools for apprenticeship on-the-job and technical training in Canada; 
 
• 
to facilitate the mobility of apprentices and skilled workers in Canada; 
 
• 
to supply employers, employees, associations, industries, training institutions and governments 
with analyses of occupations. 
 
Any questions, comments, or suggestions for changes, corrections, or revisions to this standard or any of 
its related products may be forwarded to:

Industrial electricians install, maintain, test, troubleshoot, service and repair industrial electrical equipment 
and associated electrical controls. These include equipment or components directly or indirectly exposed 
to electrical power such as motors, generators, pumps and lighting systems. Industrial electricians are 
employed by electrical contractors and maintenance departments of plants, mines, manufacturing 
facilities, government, and other industrial establishments. 
 
Industrial electricians must read and interpret prints, drawings and codes for layout and installation of 
electrical equipment. They install, service and maintain electrical components such as lighting fixtures, 
switches, conduit and electrical controls. They test electrical systems and continuity of circuits using test 
equipment to ensure system safety and compatibility. They conduct preventative and predictive 
maintenance programs and keep maintenance records. Industrial electricians may specialize in 
maintenance functions in areas such as high voltage and process control. 
 
Industrial electricians must possess manual dexterity, and good planning, organizational and 
communication skills. They also require strong analytical, mathematical and problem-solving skills in 
order to read and interpret schematics, drawings and specifications. They should have good mechanical 
aptitude to install, troubleshoot and repair equipment. It is important for industrial electricians to have a 
good grasp of digital technology because many of the skills and technology for an industrial electrician 
are computer based. They must also have good vision and hearing, the ability to distinguish colours and a 
willingness to upgrade their skills to adapt to new developments in the trade. 
 
The work environment of industrial electricians can expose them to hazards. Their work is performed 
indoors or outdoors in extreme climate conditions, and may be at variable heights or in confined spaces. 
Occupational risks include electrical shocks, arc flashes, falls, and injury from lifting and kneeling. 
 
This occupational standard recognizes similarities or overlaps with the work of construction electricians, 
powerline technicians, instrumentation and control technicians, electric motor systems technicians, 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technicians, telecommunications technicians and 
industrial mechanics (millwrights). Industrial electricians also work with process operators, engineers and 
inspectors. 
 
With experience, industrial electricians may act as mentors and trainers to apprentices in the trade. They 
may also advance to managerial, inspection, facilitation or teaching positions.

ESSENTIAL SKILLS SUMMARY 
 
Essential skills are needed for work, learning and life. They provide the foundation for learning all other 
skills and enable people to evolve with their jobs and adapt to workplace change. 
 
Through extensive research, the Government of Canada and other national and international agencies 
have identified and validated nine essential skills. These skills are used in nearly every occupation and 
throughout daily life in different ways. 
 
A series of CCDA-endorsed tools have been developed to support apprentices in their training and to be 
better prepared for a career in the trades. The tools can be used independently or with the assistance of a 
tradesperson, trainer, employer, teacher or mentor to: 
• 
understand how essential skills are used in the trades;  
• 
learn about individual essential skills strengths and areas for improvement; and 
• 
improve essential skills and increase success in an apprenticeship program. 
 
The tools are available online or for order at: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-
development/programs/essential-skills/tools.html 
 
The application of these skills may be described throughout this document within the skills and knowledge 
which support each sub-task of the trade. The most important essential skills for each sub-task have also 
been identified. The following are summaries of the requirements in each of the essential skills, taken 
from the essential skills profile. A link to the complete essential skills profile can be found at 
www.red-seal.ca  
 
READING 
In their daily work, industrial electricians read and comprehend several types of text. These include work 
orders, safety and workplace documents as well as more complex technical electrical codes, regulations 
and equipment manuals. 
 
DOCUMENT USE 
Industrial electricians must use workplace documents such as electrical diagrams and schematic 
drawings, Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and shift schedules. They must be familiar with electrical codes. It is 
necessary for industrial electricians to seek service and repair information from manuals and other 
sources. 
 
WRITING 
Industrial electricians use writing skills to record comments or notes in logbooks or work records. They 
write messages to colleagues or management to give work details or reply to requests for technical 
information. They also write longer service reports to describe problems and their solutions. 
 

 
10 
 
 Red Seal Occupational Standard – Industrial Electrician - 2016 
ORAL COMMUNICATION 
Industrial electricians use oral communication skills to coordinate work with production crews and 
equipment operators. Clear communication of technical and complex information is very important to 
avoid injuries and promote efficiency. Industrial electricians also use communication skills when working 
with co-workers and supervisors, and mentoring apprentices in the trade. Good listening skills are also 
required of industrial electricians for comprehension and understanding such as the ability to repeat back 
clearly what has been stated or learned. 
 
NUMERACY 
Industrial electricians use a range of complex math skills in their day to day work. These include 
scheduling, measurement, conversions and calculations. They use electrical theory by applying formulas 
from electrical codes to determine equipment and wiring specifications and to analyze measurements. 
 
THINKING  
Industrial electricians require strong analytical skills to troubleshoot and diagnose malfunctions in 
equipment. They use logic and memory to determine the faults. They must use decision-making skills to 
perform work planning and prioritizing. Decisions about when to perform shut-downs have important 
implications on safety in their workplace. 
Industrial electricians organize the most effective use of their time within the framework of assigned tasks. 
Routine tasks are generally assigned by supervisors or dictated by a procedure established by the 
employer. Much of their other work is in response to broken or malfunctioning equipment. They often 
have to re-prioritize tasks several times a day. Industrial electricians coordinate their work with other 
trades and production staff, all of whom have different needs and priorities. 
 
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY 
Skills in digital technology are increasingly important for industrial electricians. They use general 
applications such as e-mails, Internet, word processing, databases and original equipment manufacturer 
(OEM) software to communicate, perform research, organize their work and configure and update 
electrical equipment operating parameters. More trade specific applications include computer assisted 
design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and logic controllers. 
 
WORKING WITH OTHERS 
Industrial electricians work as part of a team that includes other tradespeople and professionals to install, 
repair and maintain industrial electrical systems and equipment. They most often work independently, co-
ordinating their work with the work of others, but for large jobs they work with a partner or crew. 
 
CONTINUOUS LEARNING 
Industrial electricians often receive in-house safety training to update their certifications such as 
Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS), transportation of dangerous goods (TDG), 
First Aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). They also receive training so that they can safely 
operate equipment such as forklifts, scissor lifts and scaffolding. They learn about new equipment on the 
job by reading manuals, taking courses and through hands-on experience. They obtain computer training 
by taking courses off-site and through e-learning.

TRENDS IN THE 
INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICIAN TRADE 
 
Technology 
Technological advancements have improved the way industrial electricians perform their work on a daily 
basis. Digital technology is increasingly being used for research, communication, programming, ordering, 
record keeping and diagnostics. New types of test equipment, along with equipment becoming more user-
friendly, has reduced the time it takes to diagnose and troubleshoot problems. Control and monitoring of 
electrical equipment is starting to migrate to both wired and wireless technology utilizing the platform of 
‘Internet of things’ (IoT). 
 
In the maintenance of industrial electrical equipment and systems, inspection and evaluation is evolving 
into a more critical area of focus. In fact, inspection is gaining more importance in assuring the health and 
safety of employees and the continued reliable operation of machinery and components. 
 
Predictive and preventative maintenance programs, using computerized maintenance management 
systems (CMMSs), are becoming more prevalent in the workplace. These systems have enhanced 
efficiency and organization of the tasks required for maintenance of electrical systems. They also 
centralize other functions such as trends, component ordering, project control, history, costing, work 
hours and tool cribs. 
 
Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and distributed control systems (DCSs) facilitate the monitoring 
and control of industrial processes and building controls. This equipment has become more pervasive. 
Smaller units are readily available for a variety of applications. Human machine interface (HMI) is 
becoming more integrated to the process control systems. Industrial electricians work increasingly less 
with hardwired devices. 
 
Reliability centered maintenance and process safety management including safety instrumented systems 
(SIS) such as safety PLCs, light curtains and area scanners are becoming more common in industry 
causing a change in focus and duties of industrial electricians. 
 
Digital technology has facilitated the use of new components, making the tracking of energy usage more 
reliable and efficient. It is simpler to replace many of the old parts and devices now that they are smaller 
and available in digital format. Data communications has evolved from multiple protocols (data highways, 
DeviceNet, Modbus) to being harmonized on a global ethernet protocol. Industrial electricians need to 
constantly upgrade their knowledge of this technology. 
 
Industry in Canada is moving towards efficient and environmentally friendly techniques and energy saving 
devices such as light emitting diode (LED) lighting, automated lighting control and variable speed drives. 
Industrial electricians need to be aware of governmental programs and regulations and energy saving 
initiatives. Industrial electricians may also be involved in the installation and maintenance of renewable 
energy systems such as solar and wind, and their associated energy storage systems. 
 
In many sectors of industry, robotic technology is being utilized. Therefore, some industrial electricians 
are now required to develop specialized skills to keep abreast of this new technology.

Safety 
The combination of various factors in the presence of a fault may cause an electrocution, arc flash and 
blast which could result in extreme burns, serious injury or death. Injuries caused by arc flash have led to 
heightened safety measures. New practices, procedures, safety equipment and jurisdictional regulations 
have been created and implemented in order to address the issue. 
 
The parameters of work for industrial electricians has increased in process control, environmental control 
and building control systems. There is now an increased emphasis on accountability for safety in the 
workplace. 
 
 

 
13 
 
 Red Seal Occupational Standard – Industrial Electrician - 2016 
INDUSTRY EXPECTED PERFORMANCE 
 
All tasks must be performed according to the applicable jurisdictional codes and standards. All health and 
safety standards must be respected and observed. Work should be done efficiently and at a high quality 
without material waste or environmental harm. All requirements of the manufacturer, company and client 
specifications, the Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) and Authority having Jurisdiction (AHJ) must be met. 
At a journeyperson level of performance, all tasks must be done with minimal direction and supervision. 
As a journeyperson progresses in their career there is an expectation they continue to upgrade their skills 
and knowledge to keep pace with industry and promote continuous learning in their trade through 
mentoring of apprentices. 
 
 

 
14 
 
 Red Seal Occupational Standard – Industrial Electrician - 2016 
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS 
 
It is expected that journeypersons are able to understand and communicate in either English or French, 
which are Canada’s official languages. English or French are the common language of business as well 
as language of instruction in apprenticeship programs.

TASK B-8 Installs and maintains protection devices 
 
TASK DESCRIPTOR 
Overcurrent protection devices provide protection against excessive currents and short circuits to service 
entrance, feeder and branch circuit conductors, and equipment. Ground fault protection devices provide 
protection against shock and current leakage and are usually used in conjunction with overcurrent 
devices. Arc fault protection devices provide protection from the effects of arc faults by de-energizing the 
circuit when an arc fault is detected. These devices also have overcurrent protection for the circuit. Surge 
protection devices prevent transient voltages from entering or leaving the system. Under and over voltage 
devices prevent under and over voltage condition to protect the downstream equipment. 
For the purpose of this standard, “install” includes both new installations and upgrading of systems by 
removing and replacing components. 
Industrial electricians maintain overcurrent, ground fault, arc fault, surge protection devices and 
under/over voltage devices by troubleshooting, diagnosing faults, replacing devices and repairing them. 
They also perform maintenance on these devices to ensure they are in good operating condition. 
For the purpose of this standard, “maintain” includes inspection, preventative/predictive maintenance, 
troubleshooting, replacing and repairing activities.

MAJOR WORK ACTIVITY C 
Installs and maintains wiring systems 
 
TASK C-16 Installs and maintains raceways, cables, conductors and 
enclosures 
 
TASK DESCRIPTOR 
Raceways contain and protect conductors and cables. Enclosures may be used to access and terminate 
the content of the raceway, and to facilitate the installation of conductors and the interconnection of 
components. Raceways and cables are installed in various environments. Industrial electricians install, 
and maintain raceways, cables and conductors. 
It is understood that conduits and tubing are raceways, however for the purpose of this standard, 
raceways are separated from conduits and tubing to identify the different skills needed to install and 
maintain them. 
For the purpose of this standard, “install” includes both new installations and upgrading of systems by 
removing and replacing components. 
For the purpose of this standard, “maintain” includes inspection, preventative/predictive maintenance, 
troubleshooting, replacing and repairing activities.

TASK D-23 Installs and maintains drives 
 
TASK DESCRIPTOR 
Electrical motors can be controlled by both AC and DC drives to achieve precision operation (e.g. speed, 
positioning) of the motors depending on the application. Industrial electricians install and maintain these 
drives in the motor circuits. They also perform maintenance to ensure motor drives and their controls are 
in good operating condition. 
For the purpose of this standard, “install” includes both new installations and upgrading of systems by 
removing and replacing components. 
For the purpose of this standard, “maintain” includes inspection, preventive/predictive maintenance, 
troubleshooting, replacing and repairing activities. 
Both installation and maintenance include programming and tuning.

TASK DESCRIPTOR 
Communication systems allow information to be transmitted by voice, sound, lighting and data from one 
point to another, using wireless and structured cabling, which includes fiber optic, copper and coaxial 
cables. These types of systems may include Class 1 and Class 2 circuits, low-voltage power circuit, extra-
low voltage power circuit or low energy power circuit. They include voice/data/video (VDV), voice over 
Internet protocol (VoIP), community antenna television (CATV), public address (PA), intercom, nurse call 
systems, and various other industrial data communication systems. 
Industrial data communication systems such as DeviceNet, Ethernet, Modbus are becoming more 
prevalent in the control environment for industrial electricians. 
For the purpose of this standard, “install” includes both new installations and upgrading of systems by 
removing and replacing components. 
For the purpose of this standard, “maintain” includes inspection, preventive/predictive maintenance, 
troubleshooting, replacing and repairing activities.

TASK F-30 Installs, programs and maintains automated control 
systems 
 
TASK DESCRIPTOR 
In industrial environments, the process requires control and the ability to interface with other systems. 
These controls can be complex automated systems. Automated control systems are often programmable 
systems such as PLC and DCS.  
The operator interfaces for many of these systems have migrated from physical hardware to graphical 
user interfaces (GUI) such as HMIs. As a result, the electrical work pertaining to the input/output devices 
has become software based. 
Automated control systems may also be integrated with Building Automation Systems. 
For the purpose of this standard, “install” includes both new installations and upgrading of systems by 
removing and replacing components. 
For the purpose of this standard, “maintain” includes inspection, preventative/predictive maintenance, 
troubleshooting, replacing and repairing activities.

APPENDIX C 
GLOSSARY 
 
arc flash 
extremely high temperature electrical discharge produced by an electrical fault 
in the air that occurs on live equipment resulting from a low impedance 
connection to ground or another voltage phase in an electrical system. The 
intensity of the discharge is dependent on the size of the energy source and 
the size of the conductors 
bonding 
low impedance path obtained by permanently joining all non-current- carrying 
metal parts to assure electrical continuity and having the capacity to conduct 
safely any current likely to be imposed on it 
cable 
a complete manufactured assembly of one or more insulated conductors which 
may also include optical fibres, fillers, strength members, insulating and 
protective material, having a continuous overall covering providing electrical, 
mechanical and environmental protection to the assembly 
cathodic protection 
protection technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that 
surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell 
dip switches 
a group of miniature switches 
commissioning 
initial startup of new equipment systematically to OEM specifications 
extra low voltage 
any voltage up to and including 30 volts, as per CEC 
grounding 
permanent and continuous conductive path to the earth with 
sufficient ampacity to carry any fault current liable to be imposed on it, and of 
a sufficiently low impedance to limit the voltage rise above ground and 
to facilitate the operation of the protective devices in the circuit  
high voltage 
any voltage exceeding 750 volts, as per CEC 
low voltage 
any voltage exceeding 30 volts but not exceeding 750 volts, as per CEC 
raceway  
any channel designed for holding wires, cables, or busbars, and, 
unless otherwise qualified by rules of the CEC, the term includes conduit 
(rigid, flexible, metal, non-metallic), electrical, metallic and nonmetallic tubing 
(EMT and ENT) underfloor raceways, cellular floors, surface raceways, 
wireways, cable trays, busways, and auxiliary gutters 
unit equipment 
a piece of equipment with its own storage battery, charging means, transfer 
switch, lamps or output terminals, test switch and indicators
