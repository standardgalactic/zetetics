Physics of Optoelectronic Devices 

Preface 
This textbook is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduate 
students in electrical engineering. physics, and materials science. It also pro- 
vides an overview of the theoretica1 background for professional researchers 
in optoelectronic industries and research organizations. The book deals with 
the fundamental principles in semiconductor electronics, physics, and elec- 
tromagnetic~, and then systematically presents practical optoelectronic de- 
vices, including semiconductor lasers, optical waveguides, directional 
couplers, optical modulators, and photodetectors. Both bulk and quantum- 
well semico~lductor devices are discussed. Rigorous derivations are presented 
and the author attempts to make the theories self-contained. 
Research on optoelectronic devices has been advancing rapidly. To keep up 
with the progress in optoelectronic devices, it is important to grasp the fun- 
danle~ltal physical principles. Only through a solid understanding of fun- 
damental physics are we able to develop new concepts and design novel 
devices with superior performances. The physics ofoptoelectronic devices is a 
broad field with interesting applications based on electromagnetics, sen~ico~i- 
d~lctor physics, and quantum meclianics. 
I have developed this book fbr a course 011 optoelectronic devices which 1, 
have taught at the University of Illinois at ' rbana-Champaign for the past ten 
years. Many of our students are stiin~.~lated 
by the practical applications of 
quantum mechanics in sen~iconductor optoelectronic devices because many 
.# 
quantum phenomena can be observed directly using artifical materials such 
as quantum-,well heterostnlctures with absorption or emission wavelengths 
determined by the quantized energy levels. 
Scope 
This book emphasizes the theory of' semiconductor optoelectror~ic devices. 
Comparisons between theoretical and experimental results are also shown. 
The book starts with the fundanlentals, including Maxwell's equations, the 
continuity equation, ar.d the basic semiconductor equations of solidLstate 
slcctronics. These equations are 'essetltial in learning scn,icond~ictor physics

confincd to the w:~veeuicle in a laser cavi ly. An undel-standing of the modula- 
tion of light is useful in designing optical switches and nlodulators. The 
absorption coefficient or bulk and cliianturn-well se~niconcluctors dernon- 
strates how light is detected and leads to a discussion on the operating prin- 
ciples of photodetectors. 
Features 
lnlportant topics such as semiconductor heterojunctions and band struc- 
ture calculations near the band edges for both bulk and quantum-well 
senliconductors are presented. Both Kane's model, assuming parabolic 
bands and-Luttinger-Kohn's model, with valence-band mixingeffects in 
quailtun] wells, are presented. 
Optical dielectric waveguide theo~y 
is discussed and applied to semicon- 
ductor lasers, dil-ectional couplers, and electrooptic modulators. 
Basic optical transitions. absorption, and gain are discussed with the 
tinle-dependent perturbation theory. The general theory for gain and 
absorption is then applied to studying interband and intersubband tran- 
sitions in bulk and quantum-well semicondtictors. 
Inlportant se~niconductor lasers such as double-heterostructure, stripe- 
geometry gain-guided sernicond~ictor lasers. quantum-well lasers, dis- 
tributed feedback lasers, coupled laser arrays, and s~lrfiice-emittinglasers 
are discussed in great detail. 
High-speed modulation of semiconductor lasers using both linear and 
nonlinear gains is investigated systen:atically. The analytical theory for 
the laser spectral linewidth enhancenlerlt factor is derived. 
New subjects such as theories on the band structures ofstrained semicon- 
ductors and strained quantum-well lasers are investigated. 
The electroabsorptions, in bulk (Franz-Keldysh effccts) and quantum- 
well sen~iconductors (quantum confined Starkeffects). are discussed sys- 
ten~aticalty including exciton effects. Both the bound and continuum 
states of escitons ilsing the hydrogen atom model are disc~~ssed. 
Intersubband transitions in quantum wells, in addition to conventional 
interband absorptions for fc.r-infrared photodetector applications, are 
presented.

Introduction 
Semiconductor optoelectronic devices, such as laser diodes, light-emitting 
diodes, optical waveguides, directional couplers, electrooptic modulators, and 
photodetectors, have important applications in optical communication sys- 
tems. To understand the physics and the operational characteristics of these 
optoeIectronic devices, we have to understand the fundamental principIes. In 
this chapter, we discuss some of the basic concepts of optoelectronic devices, 
then present the overview of this book. 
I 
BASIC CONCEPTS 
?'he basic idea is that for a semiconductor, such as GaA.s or InP, many 
interesting optical properties occur near the band edges. For example, 
Table 1.1 shows part of the periodic tabIe with many of the elements that are 
important for semiconductors [I, 21, including group IV, 111-V, and 11-VI 
compounds. For a 111-V compound semicon 'rlctor mlch as GaAs, the gal- 
lium (Ga) and arsenic (As) atoms form a zinc-biei;de structure, which consisls 
of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic Iattices, one made of gallium 
atoms and the other made of arsenic atoms (Fig. 1.1). The Ga atom h+"an 
atomic nun-tber 31, which has an [Ar] 3d1"s'-tp1 
configuration, i.e., three 
valence electrons on the outermost shell. (Here [Ar] denotes the configbra- 
tion of Ar, which has an atomic nu~nber 18, and the 15 electrons are 
clistribrlted as ls22s22p63s23p6.) 
The As atom has an atomic number 33 with 
an [Ar] 3d104s24p3 configuration or five valence electrons in the outermost 
shell. For a simplified view, we show a planar bonding diagram [3, 41 in Fig. 
1.2a, where each bond between two nearby atoms is indicated rvith two dots 
representing two valence electrons. These valence electrons are contributed 
by either Ga or As atoms. The bonding diagram shows that each atom, such 
as Ga, is connected to four nearby As atoms by four valence bonds. If we 
assume that none of the bonds is broken, tve have all of the electrons in the 
valence band and no free electrons in the concf~.rction band. 'The energy 
band diagram as a function of positiog is shown in Fig. 1.2b, where E, is 
the band edge of the cor~cluc:irjn b:in.(:i 3.11~1

constant and v is the frequency of the photon, 
: 
where c is the speed of light in free space and h is wavelength in microns 
(pm). The absorption of a photon may break a valence bond and create an 
electron-hole pair, shown in Fig. 1.2c, where an empty position in the bond 
is represented by a hole. The same concept in the energy band diagram is 
illustrated in Fig. 1.2d, where the free electron propagating in the crystal is 
represented by a dot in the conduction band. It is equivalent to acquiring an 
energy larger than the band gap of the semiconductor, and the kinetic energy 
of the electron is that amount above the conduction-band edge. The reverse 
process can also occur if an electron in the conduction band recombines with 
a hoIe in the valence band; this excess energy may emerge as a photon, and 
the process is caIled spontaneous emission. In the presence of a photon 
propagating in ,the semiconductor with electrons in the conduction band and 
holes in the valence band, the photon may stimulate the downward transition 
of the electron from the conduction band to the valence band and emit 
another photon, which is called a stimulated emission process. Above the 
conduction-band edge or below the valence-band edge, we have to know the 
energy vs. momentum relation for the electrons or holes. These relations 
provide important information about the number of available states in the 
conduction band and in the valence band. We can imagine that by measuring 
the optical absorption spectrum as we tune the optical wavelength, we can 
somewhat map out the number of states per energy interval. This concept of 
joint density of states, which is discussed further in the following chapters, 
plays an important role in the optical absorption and gain processes in 
semiconductors. 
The recent pr6gress in modern crystal growth techniques [5] such as the 
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and the metal-organic chemical vapor depo- 
sition (MOCVD), has demonstrated that it is possible to grow serniconduc- 
tors of different atomic compositions on top of another semiconductor 
substrate Mtith monolayer precision. This opens up extremely exciting possibil- 
ities of the so-called "band-gap engineering." For example, aluminum ar- 
senide (AlAs) has a similar lattice constant as gallium arsenide ( G a ~ s ) .  We 
can grow a few atomic layers of AlAs on top of a gallium arsenide substrate, 
then grow alternate layers of GaAs and MAS. We can also grow a ternary 
compound such as AI,KGa,-,As (where the aluminum mole fraction x can be 
between 
O and 1) on a GaAs substrate and form a heterojunction 
(Fig., l.3a). Interesting applications have been found using heterojunction 
structures. For example, when thc wide-gap A1 ,Cia, -,As is doped by donors, 
the free electrons from the ionized doril:*?~ renil to fall to the conduction 
bancl of the GaAs region becri.~:se of the !ohver patentia1 eriergy on that side; 
the band diagram is shown ill Fig. 1.31;. (This band bending is investigated in

heterojunction formed with different band gaps. The 
band-edge discontinuities in the conduction band and the valence band are AE, = 67%A E, and 
AE,. = 33%AEG. (b) With n-type doping in the wide-gap AI,Gal-,As 
region, the electrcins 
ionized from the donors fall into the heterojunction surface layer on the GaAs side where the 
energy is smaller and an internal electric field pointing from the ionized (positive) donors in the 
A1,Gal-,As 
region toward the electrons with negative charges cl-eateT5a band bending, which 
looks like a triangular potential well to confine the electrons. 
will create a conduction current. Since these electrons conduct in a channel 
on the GaAs region, which is undoped, the amount of impurity scatterings 
can be reduced. Therefore, the electron mobility can be enhanced. Based on 
this concept, the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) has been realized. 
For optoelectronic device applications, hetero,i.rnction structures [6].play 
important roles. For example, when semiconductol lasers were invented, they 
had to be cooled down to cryogenic temperature (77 K), and the lasers could 
lase only in a pulsed mode. These lasers had large threshold current densi- 
ties, which mearis that a large amount of current has to be injected before the 
lasers could start lasing. With the introduction of the heterojunction semi- 
conductor IaserS, the concept of carrier and photon confinements makes 
room temperature cw operation possible, because the electrons and holes, 
once injected by the electrodes on both sides of tile wide-band gap Y-N 
regions (Fig. 1.4), will be confined in the central GaAs region where the band 
gap is smaller, resulting in a smaller potential energy for the electrons in the 
conduction band as well as a smaller potential energy for holes in the valence 
band. Note that the energy for the holes is measured downward, which is 
opposite to that of the electrons. For the photons, it turns out that the optical 
refraotive index of the narrow band-gap material (GaAs) is larger than that of 
the wide-band gap material (A1,cGal -,,As). Thereforz, the photons can be 
confined in the active regior! as well. This double confinement of both 
carriers and photons ~nztkes the ~ti~~-lulaied 
emission process niore efficient 
and leads to the room-tarnperatrire operation of laser diodes. 
The control of the mole fractions of different atoms also makes the 
band-gap engineering cxtrernely ex.~itiilg. For opticaI comm~inication systems,

it has been found that minimum attenuation [7] in the fibers occurs at 1.33 
and 1.55 p m .  It is therefore natural to design sources such as light-emitting 
diodes and laser diodes, semiconductor modulators, and photodetectors 
operating at these desired wavelengths. For example, by controlling the mole 
fraction of gallium and indium in an In,-,Ga,As 
material, a wide tunable 
range of band gap is possible since TnAs has a 0.354 eV band gap and GaAs 
has a 1.424 eV band gap at room temperature. At x - 0.47, the In,Ga,-,As 
alloy has a band gap of 0.75 eV and is lattice-matched to .the InP substrate, 
because the lattice constant of the ternary alloy has a iinear dependence on 
the mole fraction: 
where u(AJ3) is the lattice constant of the binary compound AB and a(BC) is 
that of the compound BC. This linear interpolation formula works very well 
for the lattice constant, but not for. the band gap. FOI: the band-gap depen- 
dence, a quadratic dependence on the mole fraction x is usually required 
(see Appendix K for some important material systems). For &,Gal-,As 
ternary compounds with 0 5 x < 0.4, the following linear formuia is com- 
monly used at room temperature: 
Most ternary compounds require a quadratic. term. From the above formu.la, 
we can calculate the cond~.ictic>n and vall:r!cc:

These include the quantization of the subband energies with corresponding 
wave f~inctions (Fig. 1.5a). 
The success in the growth of quantum-well structures makes a study of the 
introductory quantum physics realizable in these man-made semiconductor 
materials. Due to the quasi-two-dimensional confinement of electrons and 
holes in the quantum wells, many electronic and optical properties of these 
structures differ significantly from those of the bulk materials. Many interest- 
ing quantum mechanical phenomena using quantum-well structures and their 
applications have been predicted and confirmed experimentally [8]. For a 
simple quantum-well potential, we have the partic- in a box (or well) model. 
These quantized energy levels appear in the optical absorption and gain 
spectra with exciting applications to electroabsorption modulators, quantum- 
well lasers, and photodetectors, because enhanced absorption occurs when 
the optical energy is close to the difference between the conduction and hole 
subband levels, as shown in Fig. 1.5a. The density of states in the quasi-two- 
dimensional structure is also different from that of bulk semiconductor. A 
significant discovery is that room temperature observation of these quantum 
mechanical phenomena can be observed. 'When an electric field bias is 
applied through the quantum-well region using a diode structure, the poten- 
tial profiles are tilted and the positions of the quantized subbands are shifted 
(Fig. 1.5b). Therefore, the optical absorption spectrum can be changed by an 
electric field bias. This makes practical the applications of electroabsorption 
niodulators using these quantum-well structures. 
Experimental work on l ( ~ w  threshold current quantum-well lasers [9] has 
, 
been reported for different m:iterial systems, such as GaAs/AlGaAs, In- 
GaAsPI' InP, and InGaAs /' InGr-ASP. .kclva t~ tages of the quantum-well lasers, 
such as a higher temperature stability, an improved linewidth enhancement 
factor, and wavelength tgnabiljiy, have also been demonstrated. 71kese- de-

the carrier and the optical confinements (Fig. 1.G). 
The effect of the uniaxial stress perpendicular to the junction on the 
threshold current of GaAs double-heterostructure lasers was studied experi- 
mentally in the 1970s. The idea of using strained quantum wells [9, 101 by 
growing senliconductors with different lattices constants for tunable wave- 
length photodetectors and semiconductors was expIored in the 1980s. 
Strained-layer quantum-well lasers have been investigat 
for low threshold 
current operation, polarization switching, and bistability applications. Impor- 
tant advantages using the strained-layer superlattice or quantum wells in- 
clude the reduction of the threshold current density due to the raising of the 
heavy-hole band relative to the light-hole band, the elimination of the 
intei-vale~lce band absorption, and the reduction of the Auger recombination. 
Due to the selection. rule for optical transitions, the polarization-dependent 
gains are also changed by the stress, since the optical gain is mainly TM 
polarized for the transition between the electron and the light-hole bands 
and TE polarized for the transition between the electron and the heavy-hole 
bands. Many of these details for valence subband electronic pro~erties and 
polarization selection rules in quantum-well dcvices are explained in this 
book.

optoelectronic devices. In Fig. 1.7 we illustrate the important fundamental 
equations and their applicatio~is. In the presence of inje.. .ion of electrons and 
holes using a voltage bias or an optical source, the semiconductor materials 
may change their absorptive properties to become gain media due to the 
carrier population effects. This implies that the optical dielectric function can 
be chanied. This change can be modeled with the knowledge of the elec- 
tronic band structures, which require the solutions of the Schrodinger 
equ,ation or the so-called effective-mass equation for the given bulk or 
quantum-well semiconductors. Using Mawell's equations, we obtain the 
optical electric and magnetic fields, assuming that we know the dielectric 
@nction of the semiconductors. The electronic band structur-e is. aIso depen- 
dent on the static electric bias voltage, which determines the electron and 
hole current densities.

The semiconductor electronic equations governing the electron and hole 
concentrations and their corresponding current densities have to be solved.

most complete solution would require a self-consistent scheme, which would 
require heavy co1nput;itions. Fortunately, with good understalldings of most 
of the device physics, various approximation rnetllods, such as the depletion 
approximation and pert~~rbatiop 
theories for various device operation condi- 
tions, are possible. The validity of the models can be checked with full 
numerical solutions and confirmed with experimental observations. 
After we explore the fundamentals, we investigate optoelectronic devices 
for propagation, generation, modulation, and detection of light. Below, we 
list some of the major issues of study in this book.

refers to a wide-band-gap nzaterial doped P type, and a small p 
refers to a sn~aller band-gap semiconductor doped p type.

is a very important step to understanding the device operation 
characteristics.

bounded b,y the Coulomb attractive potential, which is exactly the

intensive investigation. The materials presented in this book emphasize the 
fundamental principles and analytical skills on the essentials of the physics of

physics of optoelectronjc devices to analyze their research results, to under- 
stand more advanced materials in journal papers and research, monographs, 
and to generate novel designs of optoelcctrunir devices. Many hooks that are

Fundamentals 


Basic Semiconductor Electronics 
In the study of semiconductor devices such as diodes and transistors, the 
characteristics of the devices are described by the voitage-current relations. 
The injection of electrons and holes by a voltage bias and their transport 
properties are studied. When optical injection or emission is involved, such as 
in laser diodes and photodetectors, we are interested in the optical field in 
the device as well as the light-matter interaction. In this case, we loolc for the 
light output versus the device bias current for a laser diode, or the change in 
the voltage-current relation due to the illumination of light in a photodetec- 
tor. In general, it is useful to know the voltage, current, or quasi-static 
potentials and electric field in the electronic devices, and the optical electric 
and magnetic fields in the optoelectronic devices. Thus, a full understanding 
of the basic equations for the modeling of these devices is very important. In 
this chapter, we review the basic Maxwell's equations, semiconductor elec- 
tronics equations, and boundary conditions. We also study the generation 
and recombination of carriers in semiconductors. The gen~ral theory for 
semiconductor heterojunctions and semiconductor/metal junctions is also 
invest?gated. 
2.1 
MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS [I, 21 
Maxwell's equations are the fundamental equations in electromagnetics. 
They were first established by James Clerk Maxwell in 1873 and were verified 
experimentally [3] by ~ e i n r i c h  Hertz in 1888. Maxwell unified all knowledge 
of electricity and magnetism, 'added a displacement current density ter~n 
JD/ar in Ampkre's law, and predicted electromagnetic wave motion. He 
explained light propagation arci 
an clectr~nlagnetic wave phenomenon. 
Heinrich Hertz demonstrated experimentally the electromagnetic wave phe- 
nomenon using a spark.-gap ger~er;itor as a !ransmittcr and a loop of' wire 
with a very small gap as a receiver. He then set off' a spark in the transmitter 
and showed that a spark at the receiver was pr:c!clucecl. For' a histcxical 
account of the classical and qu.a-litrl!n thc.ory of i-ight, see Ref. 3.: for example.

( v - s / m b r  webers/m2). The two source terms, the charge density p 
(C/m3) and the current density J ( A / ~ ~ ) ,  
are related by the continuity 
equation 
where no net generation or recombination of elect]-ons is assumed. In the 
study of electromagnetics, one usually assumes that the source terms p and J 
are given quantities. It is noted that (2.1.4) is derivable from (2.1.1) by taking 
the divergence of (2.1.1) and noting that V 
(V X E) = 0 for any vector E. 
Similarly, (2.1.3) is derivable from (2.1.2) using (2.1.5). Thus, we have only 
two independent vector equations, (2.1.1) and (2.1.2), or six sca1;-!r equations, 
since each vector has three components. However, there are E, H, D, and B, 
12 scalar unknown components; thus we need six more scalar equations. 
These are the so-called constitutive relations which describe the properties of 
a rrledium. In isotropic media, they are given by 
D = E E  
B = p H  
In anisotropic media, they may be given by 
- 
D = ~ - E  B = P - H

is the permeability tensor: 
For electromagnetic fields :it optical frscluencies, p 5 0 and J = 0. 

2.2.2 Boundary Conditions 
By applying the first two Maxtvell's equations over a sinall rectangular surface 
with a width 6 (dashed line in Fig. 2.la) across the interface of a boundary 
and using Stokes7 theorem, 
the following boundary conditions can be derived by letting the width 6 
approach zero [I]: 
ii X (El - E,) = O

where J, (= limJ,,,

the unit normal vector fi points from medium 2 to medium 1. Similarly, if we 
apply Gauss's 1:lws (2.1.3) and (2.1.4) and integrate over a small volume 
(Fig. 2.1b) with a thickness 6 and let 6 approach zero, e.g., 
we obtain the following boundary conditions:

i ' ( D ,  - D,) =p, 
ii' (B, - Bz) = 0 
where p, (= lim ,,,,

For an interface between a dielectric medium and a perfect conductor, 
since the fields E,, H,? D,, and B, inside the perfect conductor vanish. The

surface charge density and the current density are supported by the perfect 
conductor surface. 
2.1.3 Quasi-electrostatic Fields 
For devices with a dc or low-frequency bias, since the time variation is very 
slow ( d / d t  - 0), we usually have 
.. 
and H = 0, B r 0 for the electronic devices for which no external magnetic 
fields are appIied. En this case, the solution of the electric field can be put in 
the form of the gradient of an electrostatic potential (25: 
and 
in an isotropic medium. Ecluatio~l (2.1.19) is Poisson's equation. When the 
frequency becomes higher, for examplc, in a microwave transistor, one may

2.2 SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRONICS EQU,!YI'%ONS 
In this section, we present the basic senlicorlductor electronics ecluations, 
which are very useful in the modeling of semiconductor devices [4-71. These 
erluations are actualIy based on the Maxwell's equations and the charge 
continuity equations. 
2.2.1 Poisson's Equation 
As shown in the previous section, Poisson's equation in the semiconductor is 
given by (2.1.19): 
where 4 is the electrostatic potential, and p is the charge density given by 
p = q ( p  - n  + C,) 
c,=N,+- N, 
Here q = 1.6 x 
C is the magnitude of a unit charge, p is the hole 
concentration, n  is the electron concentration, N,f is the ionized donor 
concentration, and Ni is the ionized acceptor concentration. 
2.2.2 Continuity Equation 
Since Ampkre's. law gives 
. 
where the conduction current density is 
and J, and J, are the hole and electron current densities, respectively, we 
have 

Assuming that C,, = N;- Ni is independent of time, we have 
a 
V -  (J, + J,,) + q-(y - n) = 0 
d l  
(2.2.8) 
Thus, we may separate the above equation into two parts for electrons and 
holes: 
a 
V - J,, - q-n 
= + q K  
d r 
(2.2.9) 
where R is the net recombination rate (cmV3 s - 9  of electron-hole pairs. 
Sometimes it is convenient to write the generation rates (G, and GI,) and 
recombination rates ( R ,  and X , , )  explicitly: 
R = R,, - GI, 
(2.2.11) 
for electrons and 
for holes. Thus, we have the current continuity equations for the carriers: 
an

2.2.3 Carrier Transport Equations 
The carrier transport equations (assuming Boltzmann digtrib~rtions for carri- 
ers) can be written as 
where E = -V$ 
is the electric field, p, and p, are the electron and hole 
nlobiIity, and D,! and U,, are [he electron and .hole diffusion coefficient, 
respectively. We may express the electric field in terms of the electrostatic 
potential in the carrier trilrlspc)ri equation. We then have J,), J,,_ 6 ,  p, n ,  or 
nine scalar components as unltnotvns. We also have (2.2.1), (2.2.13), (2.2.14]), 
(2.2.15), and (2.2.16); 
or nine scalar eclu~tticjns. We may also eliminate some 
af the ~ ~ n k n o w n  
fui:ctions

equations to three:

(2.2.19) 
with three unknowns n, p, and 4. In principle, these three unknowns can be 
solved using the above three equations once we specify the bounda.ry condi- 
tions for a given device geometIy. 
2.2.4 
Auxiliary Relations 
Often it is convenient to introduce two auxiliary relations with cwu more 
functions, F,(r) and F,(r), the quasi-Ferrni levels for the electrons and holes, 
respectively: 
n ( r )  = r l ,  exp 
(2.2.20 j 
p(r) = rl, exp 
(2.2.2 1 j 
where the intrinsic carrier concentration n i  depends on the band edge 
concentration parameters N, and N , ,  the band gap, and the temperature 
and the intrinsic energy level is 
E,(r).= -qsi,jr) -t- E,. 
(2.2.23) 
Mere E,. is a reference constant energ!,. 
We may substitute (2.2.20) and 
(2.2.21 ) into (2.2.17)-(2.2.19). and use only three unknowns, +(r): +,,(r), and 
+,(r?, which have the same dimensions ( V ) :  
.., 
1 he t~vo auxiliary relations are t'irr- !:onclegzneratc sernico.rlr:luctors, for wtlich 
the hlnswell-Bol tznzann stilt is ti.t.s ;:re applicable. To Eaki" into ascwnt the 
effect of degeneracy, one may rncjilify (2.2.20j and (2.221) simply by using the 

Fermi--Dil-ac statistics together with the elcc tron and hole del~~ity-of-state 
frlnctions p,(E) and p,,(E): 
and 
where 
is theJermi-Dirac 
distribution for electrons and 
is the Fermi-Dirac distribution for the holes. 
Density of States. 'The density of states for electrons, P,(E), is derived as 
follows. The number of electrons per unit volume is given by 
where the factor of 2 takes care of both spins of the electrons. For the 
electron states above the conduction band, we may assume that the electrons 
are in a box with a volume L,LLL- with wave numbers satisfying

(2.2.37)

nondegenerate limit, it can be sl~own that (2.2.26) and (2.2.27) reduce to 
(2.2.20) and (2.2.21).

Approximate Formula for the Fermi-Dirac Integral. An approximate ana-

is given 
by [5, 8-10] 
where, for j = f ,  one uses either [S]

The ~naximum errors of (2.2.43) are only 0.5 percent. We also see that 
These asymptotic limits are shown as dashed lines and comparecl with the 
exact numerical integration in Fig. 2.2. 
Determination of the Fermi Level EF. For a bulk seniicond~~ctor 
under 
thermal equilibrium, the Fermi level EF (= F, = F,) is determined by the 
cllarge neutrality condition: 
where N;^ is the ionized acceptor concentration and N,f is the ionized 
donor concentration. W-e have

ciegen.=s;lt.e as a res~tlt ol the two 

ciegcnerate valence bands nf k = 0, and 
where gD is the ground state degeneracy of the donor impurity level and 
equals 2. For example, assuming that NA - 0 and N, = 5 x 101'/cm3 for a 
GaAs sample at 300 K, Fig. 2 3 ,  we can plot n, p, and N '  
from (2.2.39), 
(2.2.40) and (2.2.47) vs. energy to determine the intersection point between 
the curve for NL+ p vs. energy and the curve of n vs. energy [4]. The 
horizontal reading of the intersection point gives the Ferrni energy E,.. 
In Fig. 2.3b7 we repeat the same procedure for a larger donor concentra- 
tion N, = 5 x 10's/col'. 
We can see that the Fermi level EF moves closer 
to the conduction band edge E,. Notice that at thermal equilibrium, F Z , ~ ,  
= 
n:.-~or extrinsic semiconductors, we have two cases: 
1. n-type, N,+ - N;>> n,, therefore, 
no = NL- Ni and p, =

2. p-type, N,- - N,i >> n,, therefore,

So far, we assume that p is given by the heavy holes only, since the density 
of states of the heavy holes is usually much larger than that of the light holes. 
If we take into account the contribution due to light holes, the total hole 
concentration should be

The maximum error [1.0, 111 of the above furmilla is 0.006. Further improve-

A n  alternative approach for taking into account the degenerate semicon- 
ductor is to replace ni in (2.2.20) and (2.2.21) by an effective intrinsic carrier

Fermi's golden rule. The latter approach will be discussed when we study the 
optical absorption or gain in semiconductors in Chapter 9. In general, these 
generation-recombination processes can be classified as radiative or nonra-
diative. The radiative transitions involve the creation or annihilation of 
photons. The nonradiative transitions do not involve photons; they may 
involve the interaction with phonons or the exchange of energy and momen-
tum with another electron or hole. The fundamental mechanisms can all be 
described using Fermi's golden rule with the energy and momentum conser-
vation satisfied by these processes. The processes may also be discussed in 
terms of band-to-bound state transitions and band-to-band transitions. 
2.3.1 
Intrinsic Band-to-Band Generation-Recombination Processes 
For band-to-band transitions [13-15) as shown in Fig. 2.4, the recombination 
rate of electrons and holes should be proportional to the product of the 
electron and hole concentrations 
(2.3.1) 
and the generation rate may be written as 
G = G = e 
n 
p 
(2.3.2)

nation rate is

2.4.2 Nonuniform Carrier Generation 
If the carrier generation rate is not uniform, carrier diffusion will be impor- -. 
tant. For example, if the optical illumination on the semiconductor is limited 
to only a width S, instead of the length e (Fig. 2.9a), the excess carriers 
generated in the illumination region will diffuse in both directions, assuming 
there is no external field applied in the x direction [13]. Another example is 
in a stripe-geometry semiconductor laser [20] with an intrinsic (i) region as 
the active layer where the carriers are injected by a uniform current density 
within a stripe width S (Fig. 2.9b). We ignore the current spreading outside 
the region lyl I

solution to Eq. (2.4.16) is 
where L, = (D,,T,)'/' 
is the electron diffusion length. From the symmetry of 
the problem, we know that 6rz(y) must be an eb'en function of y. Therefore, 
the coefficients A ancl B must be ecli;al. Another way to look at this is 
that the y cornponeni of thc electron current hensity J,,(y) must be zero ;it 
the symnletry plane 1) = 0. Therefore (d,/dy)i';fl(y) = O at y = 0, which also 
gives A = B.

Tlle total carrier concentration n( y) = no + an( y) -- art( y); since the active 
region is undoped, no is very small. This carrier distribution n(y) (Fig. 2.9d), 
is proportional to the spontaneous emission profiIe from the stripe-geometry 
semiconductor laser measured experimentally. In Chapter 10, we discuss in 
more detail the stripe-geometry, gain-guided semiconductor laser, and take 
into account the current spreading effects.

2.5 SENIICONDUCTOR p-N AND n-P IlETEROJUNCTIONS C20-251 
When two crystals of semiconductors with difierent energy gaps are com- 
bined, a heterojunction is formed. The conductivity type of the smaller 
energy gap crystal is denoted by a lower case n or p and that of the larger 
energy gap crystal is denoted by an upper case N or P. Here we discuss the 
basic Anderson model for the heterojunctions [21, 221. It has been pointed 
out that a more fundamental approach using the bulk and interface proper- 
tics of the semiconductors should be used for the heterojunction model 
[33-251. In Appendix D, we also discuss a model-solid theoly for the band 
lineups of semiconductor heterojunctions including the strain effects, which 
are convenient for the estimation of band-edge discontinuities. 
2.5.1 Senriconductor p-rV Heterojunction 
Consider first a p-type narrow-gap semiconductor, such as GaAs, in contact 
with an N-type wide-band-gap semiconductor, such as AI,Ga,_,As. 
Let x 
be the eIectroil affinity, which is the energy required to take an electron from 
the conduction band edge to the vacuum level, and let @ be the work 
function, which is the energy difference between the vacuum level and the 
Fermi level. In each region, the Fermi IeveI is determined by the charge 
neutrality condition 
where rr ancl p art: related tu the ilu~~si--F'i-rmi 
ieve!s f;;, and F,, respectively, 
through (2.2.39) or (2.2.47). Fr~r e.:itnlple, ir; tlle 17 region; y >is= 11, we may

then have 
which will determine the Fermi level Fp in the p region. Similarly, using 
N 
D = No+- NA- as the "net7' ionized donor concentration, we have 
which wilI determine the bulk Fermi level FN in the N region before contact. 
When the two crystals are in contact, the Fermi level will line up to be a 
constant across the junction under thermal equilibrium conditions without 
any voltage bias. Thus there will be redistributions of eIectrons and hoIes 
such that a built-in electric field exists to prevent any current flow in the 
crystal. To find the band bending, we use thc depletion approximation.

Depletion Approximation for an Unbiased p-N Junction. Since the charge 
density is 
and the free carriers y and 17 are depleted in the space charge region near 
the junction, we have 
where again N,, 
is the net acceptor concentration in the p side, and N, is 
the net donor concentration on the N side.

level should approach its thermal equilibrium value in the bulk region, 
respectively, that is, FN(x -+ +m) --+ FN (bulk value on the N side) and 
F,(x + -a) + Fp (bulk value on the p side), since the ,carrier concentra- 
tions are hardly affected away from the junction. 
It is usually assumed that the quasi-Fermi Ievels stay ,as constants across 
the depletion region, that is, F,(x) 
= FN for -x, 
5 x < :+m and F,(x)

for -a < s < x N ,  as shown in Fig. 2.14. This is equivalent to the statement 
that the carrier distribution in eilergy lor the same spe'cies of carrier across 
the depletion region stays the sanle in the depletic~n region. As, a result of 
this assumption, we find that, for the BoItznla~lr! distribution, on the p side

Basic Quantum Mechanics 
In this chapter, we present some basic quantum mechanics, which in later 
chapters will help explain the physics of optoelectronic processes and devices., 
In quantum mechanics, there are three important potentials, which have 
exact analytical solutions and are presented in most undergraduate texts 
[I, 21 on modern physics or introductory quantum mechanics. 
1. A simple sqrlnre rvell porerltinl. This potential is presented in Section 
3.2. We take into account the fact that the effective masses inside and outside 
the quantum we1.l are different for a semiconductor quantum- well. More 
discussions on semiconductor quantum-well structures are presented in 
Chapter 4. 
2. A harrnorzic oscillcrtnr. The solutions arc Hermite-Gaussian functions 
[I.-31 and are discussed in Section 3.3. A simiIar situation exists for the 
eIectric field of a waveguide with a parabolic permittivity or gain profile, since 
the solutions to the wave equation with a parabolic dependence on the 
position are also the Hermite-Gaussian functions. 
3. A hydrogen ntonz. The solutions for both the bo~lnd states ( E  < 0) and 
the unbound (continuum) states ( E  > 0) are presented. Most textbooks 
cliscuss the bound states only, because they are important for hydrogen 
atoms. We use the hydrogen atom model to describe an exciton, which is 
formed by an electroll-hole pair. The optical absorption process involving 
the CouIomb interadion between the electron and hole is called the excitonic 
absorption. The excitonic absorption spectrum is strongly dependen.t on the 
energies and wavc functions of the exciton bound and continuum states. In 
bulk semiconductors, the el-ectron-hole interaction is a Coulomb potential in 
a three-dimensional space. In quantum-well semiconductors, electrons and 
holes are confined to a quasi-twc-diinensional structure; thus, their binding 
energy is diffkrent from the three-dimensional results. In Section 3.4 we 
summarize the analytical soltltions for the hydrogen mode1 in both three- 
dirncnsional ,and two-ctimensional space fur both the bound and unboiirld 
states [4-81,. The cle tailed derivntior.ls are prescn ted in Appendix A. These 
results are 'used in Cl~apttrr i.3 whew vie (discuss excitonic absorption ancl 
cluantuni-confined Stark elYzct.:i. 
Since most potentials e:tc'c p t tliz ai?(:)vr: three clo not have exact, :tnalyticnI 
so!utiuns, we h:~ve to use pert~rrbatiol! rr!i:thod~ to fincl their eigenfunctions 

and eigenenergies. We present a conventional time-independent perturba- 
tion tl~eory in Section 3.5, then a slightly modified perturbation theory, called 
the Lowdin's method [9] in Section 3.6. The Liiwdin's method is applied to 
derivc the semiconductor band structures, such as the Luttinger-Kohn 
Hamiltonian in Chapter 4. In Section 3.7, we present the time-dependent 
perturbation theory and derive Fermi's golden rule, which is important to our 
~~nderstanding 
of tk.emission and absorption of photons.

which is the continuity equation or the conservation of probability density. It 
is analogous to the charge continuity equation in electromagnetics. 
The expectation value of any physical quantity is given by 
where 0 is an operator for the physical quantity and the volume of integra- 
tion is over the whole space. In the above real-space representation, that is,

If V(r, t )  is independent of t ,  the solution @(r, t )  can always be obtained

which is the so-called time-independent Schradinger equation. The solution 
may be in terms of quantized energy levels E, with corresponding wave 
functions @n(r), or a continuoils spectrum E with corresponding wave func- 
tions $&-). 
In generaI, any solution of the Schrodinger equation may be 
constructed from the superposition af these stationary solutions: :

For a two-particle system, we use a wave function +(r,, r,, t )  to describe 
the particle 1 at r,, and particle 2 at r,, al time t. Here we assume that the

3.2.1 Infn.ite Barrier lVZodel 
First we assume tha-t V,, is infinitely high; thus, the wave function vanishes at 
the boundaries. The solution to the infinite barrier model satisfying the

i-e., the energy En and the wave nutnber k 7  in the z direction are quantized. 
The wave function has been normalized j ~ l ~ , , ( z ) 1 2  
dz = 1. 
If the origin of the coordinate z = 0 is chosen at the center of the well, 
V ( + z )  = V ( - z ) ,  the solution can always be put in terms of even or odd 
functions by parity consideration: 
n even 
n odd 
which can be obtained from (3.2.2) by replacing z by z + L / 2  and discarding 
any minus signs, since we have the freedom to choose the phase of the wave 
function. The parity consideration is very useful since the symmetry proper- 
ties of the system are employed; thus, the wave functions have associated 
symmetry properties. 
In general, if V ( z )  = V ( - z ) ,  for any solution +(z) of the Schrodinger 
equation (3.2.1.), +(-z) will also be a solution with the same eigenenergy, as 
can be seen by changing I ro - z  in (3.2.1). If we form linear combinations of

In this section, we summarize the major results of the energies and wave 
functions for the hydrogen atom model with both bound (E < 0) and 
continuum ( E  > 0) state solutions. The hydrogen atom is a two-particle 
system for the positive nucleus (with a mass m,) at a position r ,  and an 
electron (with mass rn,) at a position r,. A general solution is to transform 
from r, and r ,  coordinates to the center-of-mass coordinates R and the 
difference coordinates r:

In most practi~lil physical systems, the Schrodinger equations do not have 
exact or analytical soIutions. It is always convenient to find the solutions 
using the perturbation method when the problem of interest can be sepa- 
rated into two parts: One part consists of an "unperturbed". Hamiltonian 
with known solutions, Ht"), and the other pal-t consists of a smalI perturbing

The second subscript

 IT.^ = I., 2,. . . , N, may also be degenerate wave functioils. Substituting (3.5.31) 
directly into (3.5.30) and taking the inner product with respect to &iO), 
I\: = 1,. . . , N, gives 
if (4:)) form an orthonormal set. If (#$', m = 1,2,. . . , N )  are not orthonor- 
ma1 to each other, 
then, the above eigenequation becomes 
The eigenequations (3.5.33) or (3.5.35) can be solved by letting 
detJI-i,, - ES,,(

(3 -5.36) 
det(H,,,, - EN,,(

The above procedure is equivalent to diagonalizing -the matrix H,,, 
in 
(3.5.33) or simultaneously diagonalizing H,, 
and N,, 
in (3.5.35) (noting that 
N is also Hermitian). Finally, one: finds the eigenvalues for E and the 
eigenvector a,,. The wave function is ':obtained from (3.5.31), which should be 
normalized.

3.5.3 Variational Principle 
The above equations can also be derived from the variational principle by 
minimizing the functional for the energy 
assuming 

for the eigenfunction. Using 
SA - ESB

if E = A / B ,  we obtain 
When the basis functions (+I:)) 
are orthonormal to each other, the above 
equation reduces to

3.6 LOWDIN-:; RENONVLALIZATION METHOD [91 
A n  interesting technique in perturbation theory is Lowdin's perturbation 
method. It may be useful to divide the eigenfunctions and energies into two 
classes, A and B. Suppose we are mainly interested in the-states in class A, 
and we look for a formula for class A with the influence from the states in B 
as a perturbation. \Ye start wit11 eige-nequation (3.5.42), ' assuming that the

Or, equivalently, we solve the eigenvalue problems for a,, ( n  E A): 
and 
When the coeFcients n,, belonging to class A are determined from the 
eigenequation (. !.5), the coefficients n ,  in class B can be found from (3.6.6). 
A necessary condition for the expansion of (3.6.4) to be convergent is 
In practice, to the second order in perturbation, we may replace E by EA in 
(3.6.4), where EA is an average energy of states in class A, and truncate the 
series (3.6.4) at the second-order term. For example, if class A consists of 
only a single nondegenerate state n. then class B consists of the rest. 
Equation (3.6.5) gives only one equation:

To find the solution +(r, t )  to the time-dependent Schrodinger ecluation, we 
expand the wave function in terms of the unperturbed solutions:

Theory, of Electronic Band Structures 
in Semiconductors 
To understand the optical properties of semiconductors, such as absorption 
or gain due to electronic transitions in the presence of an incident optical 
wave, we have to know the electronic band structure, including the energy 
band and the corresponding wave function. Knowing the initial and final 
states of the electrons, we may calculate the optical absorption using Fermi's 
golden rule (Section 3.7). In this chapter, we discuss the calculation of the 
band structures. For optical devices, most semiconductors have direct band 
gaps, and many physical phenomena near the band edges are of great 
interest. We focus on the conduction and valence band structures near the 
band edges, where the k . p method is extremely useful. 
4.1 THE BLOCH Tf-i LOREM AND THE k . p METHOD 
FOR SIMPLE BANDS 
For a periodic potential, the electronic band structure and the wave function 
can be derived from the Hamiltonian, which satisfies the symmetry of the 
senliconductor crystals. The general theory follows the BIoch theorem [I], 
which is discussed in this section. Numerical methods to find the band 
structures and the wave functions include the tight binding, the pseudopoten- 
tial, the orthogonalized plane wave, the augmented plane wave, Green's 
function, and the cellular methods. Many texts on solid-state physics have 
detailed discussions on these methods [I, 21. Our interest here is near the 
, 
band edges of direct band-gap semiconductors, where the wave vector k 
deviates by a small amount from a vector k, where a local minimum or 
maximum occurs. The k . p method was introduced by Bardeen [3] and Seitz ' 
[dl. The method has also been applied by many yesearchers to semiconduc- 
tors [5-101. Here we discuss Krtne's model [7, 81, which takes into account the 
spin-orbit 
interaction, 2nd Lurtinger-Kohn's 
models [9] for degenerate 
bands. These models are very popular in st~lclying bulk and 'quantum-well 
semiconductors and have beer) used during the past three decades. They are 
much easier to apply than most other nunlerical methods. For a general 
discussion? see Refs. 1 1 - 1.4.

For ar, electron i11 a periodic potential 
where R = n,a, + n,a, + n,a,, and a,, a,, a, are the lattice vectors, and 
n,,n,, and n, are integers, the electron wave function satisfies the Schrodinger 
equation 
?'he Hamiltonian is invariant under translation by the lattice vectors, r -+ 
r + R. If $(r) describes an electron moving in the crystal, $(r + R) will- also 
be a solution to (4.1.2). Thus, +(r + R) will differ from *(r) at most by a 
constant. This constant must have a unity magnitude; otherwise, the wave 
function may grow to infinity if we repeat the translation R indefinitely. ?'he 
general solution of the above equation is given by

Here n refers to the band and k the wave vector of the electron. A full 
description of the band structure requires numerical methods [I, 21. An 
example of the GaAs band structure calculated [I51 by the pseudopotential 
method is shown in Fig. 4.1a, which represents the general energy bands 
along different k directions. Our interest will focus near the direct band gap 
(r* valley) between the valence t~and edges and the conduction band edge, as 
shown in Fig. 4.l.b, where the energy dispersions for a small k vector are

4.1.1 The k . p Theory for a Single Band 
If the band structure o, .nterest is near a single band, such as the band edge 
of a conduction band (Fig. 4.2a) and the coupling to other bands is negligible, 
then the perturbation theory and Lowdin's method (as discussed in Sec- 
tion 3.6) give the same results. Here the particular band of interest, labeled 
n, is called class A, and class R consists of the rest ofithe bands, nf # n. The 
time-independent perturbation theory, Eq. (3.5.21b) in Section 3.5, gives the 
energy to second order in perturbation: 
I 
and the wave function to the first order in perturbation (3.5.16a):

If k, is at an extremum of E,(k), then Et,(k) must depend quadratically on k 
near k, and P,~,, = 0. That is wlzy we need to go to second-order perturbation 
theory for the energy correction and only the first-order correction is needed 
for- the wave function. Since we set k, to 0, we have

zred, we call them class A, as shown in Fig. 4.2b. To solve (4.1.6), we gssume

In Kane's model for direct band semiconductors, the spin-orbit interaction is 
taken into account. Four bands-the 
conduction, heavy-hole, light-hole, and 
the spin-orbit split-off bands-are 
considered, which have double degener- 
acy with their spin counterparts (Fig. 4.3a).

Suppose we are mainly interested in the six valence bands (the heavy-hole, 
light-hole, and spin-orbit split-off bands, all doubly degenerate) and ignore 
the coupling to the two dagenerate conduction bands with both spins. It is 
convenient to use Lowdi.: 
perturbation method and treat the six valence 
bands in class A and put the rest of the bands in class B (Fig. 4.3b). Note 
that Luttinger-Kohn's model can also be generalized to include both conduc- 
tion bands in class A, especially for.-narrow. band-gap semiconductors.

4.4.1 The Eflective Mass T h m ~  
for a Single Band 
The most important conclusion o.f the effective mass theory (EMT) for a 
single band is as fc?Ilows: If the energy dispersion relation for a single band rr 
near k, (assuming 0) is given bjl 
for the Hamiltonian H, with a periodic potential V(r) 
then the solution for the Schrodinger equation with a perturbatit~ln U(r) such 
as an impurity potential or a quantum-we11 potential 
is obtainable by solving 
for the envelope function F(r) and the energy E. The wave function is 
approximated by 
I 
The most important result is that the periodic potential V(r) determines the 
energy bands and the effective masses, ( I / ~ z " ) , ~ ,  and the effective mass 
equation (4.4.5) contains only the extra perturbation potential U(r), since the 
effective masses already take into account the periodic potkntia~ (Fig. 4.5).

the most important parametel-s characterizing any semiconductor materials.

will be under biaxial tension (Fig. 4.7). Here biaxial tension 
means that the lattice in the parallel ( x y )  plane will experience a tensile 
strain with a simultaneous compressive strain along the growth ( 2 )  direction. 
On the other hand, if x < 0.468, we have a(x) > a,, and we wi1.l have the 
case of biaxial compression. 
At the zone center, k = 0, we have only PE and Q, appearing in the 
diagonal terms of the matrix (4.5.13) nonvanishing. Therefore, we obtain the 
band-edge energies of the heavy-hole and light-hole bands: 
On the other hand, the conduction band-edge energy of the electron is given 
by

The effective band gaps are given by

unstrained case, the following expressions, 
give the heavy-hole and light-hole dispersion relations. 
The dispersion relations for the heavy-hole band EHH(k) and the light-hole 
band ELH(k) vs. the crystal growth direction k, and the parallel direction k, 
can be obtained analytically from (4.5.27~1) and (4.5.27b), respectively. AJong 
the parallel plane, e.g., the k ,  direction ( k ,  = k ,  = 01, we have for Q, < 0 
(biaxial compression) and k ,  is finite

which agree with (4.5.19). Along the k z  direction: we obtain for both

The results of the valence-band structure for EkIH and EL,+ versus k, and k, 
for both compression and tensio~l are shown in- Fig. 4.8 for Ga ,Inl -,As 
grown on InP substrate. \We cari see clearly that the heavy-hole band has a 
lighter efiective mass than the light-hole band in the li, direction near 
k, = 0 for the compressioll case ((I, 
< 0). The heavy hole still keeps its 
feature of a heavy effective mass along the ki direction, and it is above the 
light-hole band at k = 0 for the conipression case, On the other hand, the 
light-hole band is above the heavy hole band in the case of tension ( x  > 0.468). 
For a finite and fixed strain, the small-k expansion of the above dispersion 
relation can be written as 
where the transverse wave vector has a m;! itude k ,  = dk: + k : .  From

4.5.3 Band Structures of Strained Semiconductors With Spin-Orbit 
Split-Off Bands Coupling [351 
If the coupling with the spin-orbit split-off bands is taken into account, the 
6 x 6 Hamiltonian (C.24) in Appendix C has to be used. For the band edge 
at k = 0, the Hamiltonian H is simplified to

band coupling. (After Ref. 38.) 
Clearly, the heavy-hole bands are decoupled from 
2 rest of bands, while the 
light-hole bands (1:. 
'.. + f}) are coupled with the split-off bands (It, i)) 
through the strain-dependent off-diagonal terms. This coupling would be 
totally trnaccounted for in the 4 x 4 approximation. For In, -,Ga,As 
on InP, 
the transition energies from the heavy-hole and the light-hole bands to the 
conduction band with and without the SO coupling are shown [38] in Fig. 4.9. 
The comparison demonstrates how important it is to include the spin-orbit 
split-off bands, because the error in the light-hole energies could be as large 
, 
as several tens of millielectron volts. The error is comparable to the heavy-hole 
and light-hole energy splits and is certainly too large to be ignored. As a 
consequence of the coupling, the eigenvectors corresponding to the energy

and split-off states. The band-edge energies can be readily solved from 
(4.5.33) or (4.5.35a), 
If the split-off bands are included in the 6 x 6 Hamiltonian, the E-k 
relation determined by (4.5.26) becomes a sixth-order polynon~ial of E, which 
apparently can be decomposed into two identical cubic polynomials because 
of the symmetry property of the Hamiltonian. However, an attempt to 
expand and factor directly the determinantal equation is tedious. The details 
are given in Ref. 38. 
The most important results are obtained from the series expansion of E 
up to the second order of k near the band edges: 
where f + and f'- are dimensionless, strain-dependent factors 
where .r = Q,.,/h and I<' - A,: + !;'. 
The hand-edge energies 111 (4.5.37a)- 
(4.5.37~) 
are given in (4.5.3:ia)--li.S.-3!;c!. 

From (4.5.37a)-(4.5.37c) we obtain tlle effective nlasses perpendicular 
(I 
= z )  and parallel (11 - I )  to the x-JJ plane: 
Note that f + = 1, f - = 0 for the limiting case of zero strain (Q, + 0, x + O), 
-... 
and the effective masses derived from the 6 X 6 Hamiltonian become iden.ti- 
cal to those derived from the 4 x 4 Hamiltonian.

KRONIG-PENNEY MODEL FOR A SUPERLATTICE 
In this section, we apply the propagation matrix approach discussed in 
Section 4.6 to study a one-dimensional periodic potential problem [44]. The 
results are the fionig-Penney model for a superlattice structure [45-451. 
The superlattice structure is shown in Fig. 4.14. Each period (or cell) 
consists of one barrier region with a width b and a well region with a width 
w. The period is L - b + w. The potential within a period 0 < z < L is 
given by 
and V(z + nL) = V ( z )  for any integer rz.

In Fig. 4.160 we plot the energy spectrum for the electron minibands for a 
superlattice with a well width w = 100 A and the barrier width b varying 
from 1 to 80 A. We see that the width of the miniband energy decreases as 
the barrier width is increased because the coupling among wells becomes 
weaker f'or a thicker barrier. The heavy-hole and light-I:.;:le minib~mds for the 
same GaAs/A.lo,,Gao,,As superlattice are shown in Figs. 4.16b and c, 
respectively. We use AE, = 0.33 AE,, and rnk, = rn0/(y, - 2y,), m;, =

BAND STRUCTURES OF SEMICONDUCTOR QUANTUM WELLS 
Ip Section 4.4, we discussed the effective mass theory for a single band and 
degenerate bands. In this section, we study the calculation of the band 
structures of semiconductor quantum wells. Many papers [51-671 on the 
recent development of the effective mass theory or the k - p theory for 
quantum-we11 structures have been published. Theoretical methods such as 
the tight-binding [68] and the bond-orbital models [69, 701 have also been 
introduced. Here we focus on the k - p method of the Luttinger-Kohn 
Hamiltonian together with the strain terms of Pikus and Bir, as discussed in 
Sections 4.4 and 4.5. 
4.8.1 Cr.nduction Band 
The effective mass theory for the conduction band is obtained frorn the 
dispersion relation 
where the effective-mass of the electron in the conduction band is rrz* = m,* 
in the barrier region and nz* = nz*, in tfie quantum well. In the presence of 
the quantum-well potential, 
where the energies are all rncasur-ec'r frorn the cond~lction band edge. Ths

effective mass equation (4.4.5) for a single band is 
where ( l / n t ) ( d / d z )  appears inside d / d z  to ensure that the probabiIity 
current density 
is continuous at the heterojunction. 
In general, the wave function $(r) can be written in the form 
and 
I 
The eigenvalue and the eigenfunction are obtained from the above equation, 
foIlowing the procedures discussed in Chapter 3. Here we ignore the k t  
dependence of $ ( z ) .  Equation (4.8.5) is usually solved at k !  = 0 for the nth 
subbancl znergy E,,(O) with a wave function $ ( z )  = fn(; . Then we have 
En(k,) = E,,(O) + f ~ ~ k : / 2 r n , .  
4.8.2 
Valence Band 
Band-Edge Energy. For a given cpantum-well potential, 
let us find the band-edge energy at k ,  = 0 first. The Luttinger-Kohn Hamil- 
tnnian (4.3.14) or (4.5.13) is diagonal for k, 
= k,, = 0: 

Define 
Since the parameters y ,  and y 2  in the well are different from those in the 
barrier regions, we solve 
where (m) 
= (hhm) or (Ihm). Therefore, the band-edge energies for the hhm, 
or lhm subbands can all be found from the equation identical to that for the 
pa~mabolic band model. We only have tc! use the appropriate effective masses 
(4.8.83) and (4.8.8b) in the corresponding regions.

well width L,. We can see that Fol- thc magnitudes all energy levels decrease 
with an increasing well width.

98 A wells (doped in the center 35 A) at the above indicated concentration

valence band mixing behavior in quantum wells. 
We can see that the coupling between the heavy-hole HH1 and the light 
LH1 subbands leads to warping (or nonparabolicity) of the band structure. 
These valence band mixing effects cause the wave function to exhibit both the 
heavy-hole and the light-hole characteristics. Here the labeling of H H  and 
LH is according to their wave functions at k ,  = k ,  = 0, since I;, f +) are 
assigned to that of the 11e;lvy hole, and it, f f) are assigned to that of the

we find that the energy subband dispersion relation is independent of the 
angle 4 because 
and the Hamiltonian depends only on the magnitude of the vector k , .  This is 
called the axial approximation. Note that in this approximation, we assume 
that y ,  -- y, in the R, term only, while we still use y, and y, in the other 
terms. We obtain 
and 
4.8.6 Numerical Approach for the Solutions of the Upper 2 x 2 
HamiItonian under Axial Approximation 
Let us look itt the upper 2 X 2 Hamiltonian in (4.8.16). The wa1.c' function for 
the hole subbands can be written generally as 
This wave function satisfies the Hamiltonian equation 
where P, 0, 
and R are all dii!erir!ti:!l 
operators i~nd can be obtained from 
(C.23 and (4.8.25) with k; replaced by - L(?/dz). These wave functions g'" 
and g('' depend on the rni~gnitudi: of thr. LY;LV< vector k :  and position 2 ,  and 

are independent of the direction o f  the wave vector (or the angle us): 
The built-in quantum-well potential for the holes Vh(z) has been incorpo- 
rated into the diagonal terms of the Hamiltonian. Since V/,(z) is a stepwise 
potential, boundary conditions between the well and the barrier interface 
have to be used properly. The basic idea is that the envelope function and 
the probability current density across the hcterojunction should be continu- 
ous. Therefore, to ensure the Hermitian property of H, we have to write all 
operators of the form 
and 
We then have the following boundary conditions: 
[::I 
= continuous 
?dote th;it- the l,uttinger prirarne:zrs 
y , ,  y,, anci y, in ':he corxsponding 
region have t~ be used. 

Eq. (4.3.25) can be solved using a propagation-matrix niethocl [37], which is 
very efficient, or using a finite-cliffercnce n~cthod [76]. The solution to the 
Schrodinger equation in matrix f ~ r m  (4.8.38) will be a set of subband 
where the subband index rn refers to HH1, HH2,. . . and LH1, LH2,. . 
subbands. The superscript U refers to the upper Hamiltonian. 
4.8.7 Solutions for the Lower 2 X 2 Harniltonian under Axial Appropimation 
Similar procedures hold for the Iower 2 X 2 Hamiltonian of (4.8.16). The 
wave function is 
which satisfies the Hamil tonian equation 
The solution will be a set of dispersion curves labeled as m in E k ( k ,  ). For a 
symmetrical potential, we find that E;(k,) 
of the lower Hamiltonian is 
degenerate with that of the upper Hamiltonian ~ L ( k , ' l  
for each subband m. 
The wave functions g(3'(k,, z )  and g(')(k,, z )  can also be reIated to g")(k,, z) 
and g(')(k,, z ) ,  respectively, if we change z --+

Subband Energies in a Strained Quantum Well 
The conduction band-edge energy for a strained quantum well is given by 

Si~nllarly, the valence band-edge energy for the tinstrained cluantum well is 
defined as 
The valence band-edge energies f'or the strained quantum well are obtained 
from EHH(0) and ELkf(0) 
in (4.5.36) ignoring the coupling with the spin-orbit 
split-off band. 
where 
The subband edge energies can all be obtained from a simple quantum-well 
,.' 
model using the band-edge effective masses: 

where the subscripts w axd h in the effective mass parameters designate the 
well and the barrier region, respectively. 
If the spin-orbit split-off band is included, we find that the band-edge 
energies for heavy hole E,,,,(z) and mi, are not affected, but 
and 
where f+ is defined in (4.5.38). 
4.9.2 Valence Subband Energy Dispersions in a Strained Quantum Well. 
Using H from (4: .13), we can solve the valence subband energi-- . and 
eigenfunctions using (4.5.14):

Electromagnetics 
In this chapter, we discuss a few important results using electromagnetic 
theory. In Section 5.1 we present the general solutions to Maxwell's equa- 
tions for a given current density J and a charge density p which satisfy the 
continuity equation. We discuss the gauge transformation including 
the b r e n t z  gauge and the Coulomb gauge; the latter will be used in the 
HamiItonian to account for the interaction between the electrons and the 
photon field in semiconductors in Chapter 9. The time-harmonic fields and 
the duality principle, which will be useful in studying the propagation of light 
in waveguides and laser cavities, are presented in Section 5.2. The duality 
principle allows us to obtain the guided wave solutions for the transverse 
magnetic (TM) polarization of light once we obtain the solutions for the 
transverse electric (TE) polarization of light, as we show in Chapter 7. 
The plane wave reflection from a layered medium is investigated in 
Section 5.3 for both TE and TM polarizations. These results are useful for 
understanding the ray-optics approach to the optical waveguide theory. T1. 
radiation of the electromagnetic tield is pi-esented in Section 5.4 with the aini 
that the far-field pattern from a diode laser and laser arrays will be derived 
once we know the laser mode on the facet of the laser cavity. In Appendix E, 
we discuss the EC1-arners-Kronig relation, which relates the real part of a 
permittivity function to its inlagiriary part. This is useful in optical materials 
because often the absorption coefficients of the semiconductors are mea- 
sured, then the real parts of the refractive indices are calculated based o n  the 
Kramers-Kronig relation. The Poyntjng's theorem for power conservation 
and the reciprocity theorem are included in Appendix F. 
5.1 GENERAL SOLUTIONS TO ;MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS 
AND GAUGE TRANSFORMATlONS [11 
In this section, we study the general solution5 to Maxwell's equations: 

where the sou;-ce terms 1, :mcl .J satisfy the continuity equation 
Since 
for any vector A, we can write B in the form 
However, this equation does not uniquely specify A. If we add V t  to A, where 
6 is an arbitrary function, we find that 
still satisfies V x A' = H .  From the fundamental theorem of vector analysis, 
to uniquely define a vector A, we have to specify both its cur1 and its 
divergence. 
Substituting (5.1.7) into (5.1 .I), we obtain 
Since O x (-V+) - 0 for any ftlnction #, we may write 
Assuming an isotropic honlogeneous medium 
and substituting the expressions for B and E from (5.1.7) and (5.1.10) into

Thus, generally speaking, we should find the solutions for the scalar potential 
4 and the vector potential A from (5.1.13) and (5.1.15) in terms of the sources 
p and J. We still have to choose a gauge to uniquely specify the potentials 4 
and A. Since for any 4 and A satisfying (5.1.7) and (5.1.10), the following 
gauge transformations 
atso satisfij (5.1.7) and (5.1.10), where ( is an arbitrary function. Thus, we 
have to specify V . A. There are two common ways to specify V - A: the 
Lorentz gauge and the Coulonlb gauge.

TIME-HARMONIC FIELDS AND DUALITY PRINCIPLE [I]

their depcndencies on the angular frzqucncy o are implicitly assumed.

then Maxwell's equations stay unchanged. Thus, for a given solution (E, H) in 
a medium (,u, E ) ,  we have a corresponding solutio~~ 
(H, -E) in a rnedi~im 
(E, p). This is the duality principle. Since the boundn~y conditions in which 
the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields are continuous 
across the dielectric interfaces and stay the same in both media, we have a 
dual situation such that the simultancous replacements in (5.2.13) give the 
soIutions to Maxwell's ecluations .as well. If including both electric and 
mngne tic sources, we write 

Once we make the following identification 
we find that Wlaxwell's equations are invariant. As an application, if we know 
the solutions (E, H) to the original Maxwell equations in a meditlm ( p ,  E )  due 
to the electric sources p, and J, wc can obtain the "dual" set of solutions due 
to the magnetic sources p, 
and M in a medium ( E ,  p )  with "dual" boundary 
conditions. For example, tangential magnetic fields are continuous vs. tan- 
gential electric fields ct~ntinuous in the original problem with electric sources. 
Applications of (5.2.13) are discussed in Chaptcr 7, where we explore the 
optical waveguide theory for* both the TE and T M  polarizations. The idea is 
that once tve obtain the field solutions for the TE polarization in a dielectric 
waveguide from Maxwell equations, we can use the duality principle to write 
down the T M  solutions silllply by inspection.

5.3 PLANE WAVE REFLECTION FROM A LAYERED MEDIUM [I, 31 
In this section, we first discuss plane wave reflection from a single planar 
interface between two dielectric media. We then present a propagation-matrix 
approach to plane wave reflection from a multiple layered medium.

for dielectric materials. 
The reflected fields are given by 
The transmitted fields are

the tangential magnetic field ! H z )  is continuous leads to

occurs at an angle of incidence larger than the critical angle B,, given by the 
condition when 8, = 90": 
k ,  sin 8,. = k ,

along the - x  diiection: 
The reflection coefficient beconies

The fraction of the power reflected from its boundary is given by the 
reflectivity R: 
The transmissivity is given by 
Power conservation requires R + T = 1, which can also be checked by 
substituting (5.3.14) and (5.3.15) into (5.3.20) and (5.3.21). It is clear that if 
Oi > 8,, total internal reflection occurs; the tra~lsmissivity is zero since k,, is 
purely imaginary, and the reflectivity is unity, ) r 2  = e-i'4121 = 1. However, 
the reflected field experiences an optical phase shift of an amount -2412.

This angle is called the Goos-Hanchen phase shift.

Propagation Matrix Approach for Plane Wave Reflection

If the medium is inhomogeneous along the x direction E = ~ ( x )  
and p =

gation matrix method, as shown in Section 4.6 for the Schrodinger equation. 
We use

In many cases of radiation of the fields, for example, if the source distribu- 
tion is over a finite region and the observation point r is far away from the 
source, we may approximate 
where r^ is a unit vector along the r 'direction, as shown in Fig. 5.4. The 
distance r^ - r' is the projection of r' on r^ and the distance Jr - r'l is 
approximately the difference -between the length r and: i - r'. With this 
approximation, we further approximate 
where k = kr^ is along the direction of observatiod. We keep the term F . r' 
only in the phase factor, since any small variation in r' comparable with 
wavelength causes a big change in the phase ,of e-ik"' , but a negligible 
change in the denominator of (5.4.18). since r is very large in the far-field 
region. We consider radiotioa into the free spa&, k = li, = W ~ G .

Propagation of Eight 

Light Propagation in Various Media 
The propagation of light is an interesting topic because many common 
phenomena such as refraction of light, polarization properties of light, and 
scattering of light can be observed every day. The Rayleigh scattering of light 
by water molecules has been used to explain why the sky is blue in the 
daytime and red in the evening. In this chapter, we discuss some basic 
properties of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in isotropic and 
uniaxial media [I-21. For light propagation in gyrotropic media and the 
magne tooptic effects, see Appendix G. 
6.1 PLANE WAVE SOLUTlONS FOR MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS 
IN HOMOGENEOUS MEDIA 
We shall investigate solutions to Maxwell's equations in regions where 
J = p = 0. Maxwell's equations for a harmonic field become 
We also assume that the media are homogeneous; therefore, we have plane 
wave solutions of the form exp(ik r). Since all complex field vectors E, H, B, 
and D have the same spatial dependence exp(ik. r), we obtain the basic 
relations for plane waves prop-agation in source-free homogeneous media: 
We see that the wave vector ki is altx~ys pez-pendiculrtr tu B and D from 
(6.1.2~) and (G.1.2d). But we cannut sity th::tt k is always perpendicular. to H or 

E unless the media are isotropic. J.n isotropic media, D = EE and 'sB = p H .  
Therefore, 11 and I3 are parallel to E and H, respectively. Otherwise, the 
media are called anisotropic. 'Thus, the tirne-averaged Poynting vector, which 
is given by $ R ~ ( E  
X H'"), does not necessarily point in the direction of k in 
an anisotropic medium. In other words, the direction of power flow of a 
plane wave may not always be in the direction of the wave vector k. 
In the following sections, we discuss how characteristic polarizations and 
propagation constants in a given medium are obtained. A characteristic mode 
or normal mode is defined as a wave with a polarization, which does not 
change while propagating in the homogeneous medium. This polarization is 
called the characteristic polarization of the medium. 
6.2 
LIGHT PROPAG.ATION IN ISOTROPIC MEDIA 
In isotropic media, the constitutive relations are simply 
Thus, D is always parallel to E, and £3 is parallel to H. Any polarization 
direction of E can be a characteristic polarization of the isotropic medium. 
Equations (6.1.2a)-(6.1.2d) become 
These are the equations satisfied by plane waves in isotropic media. One sees 
clearly that 
1. k is perpendicular to both E and H. 
2. k x E points in the direction of H, and k X H points in the direction 
of -E. 
Thus, the three vectors E, H, and k are p:-rpendicular to each other. 
Let us take the cross pr-~!uct of (6.2.3~1) h : ~  k from the left-hand side: 

The left-hand side can be simplified using the vector identity 
where we have made use of (6.2.36). We obtain 
using (6.2.3b). The result is simply 
The solutions to the above equation are either a trivial solution, E = 0 (no 
field, which is not of interest), or

At an optical energy below the band gap of most semiconductors, the 
absorption is usually small or negligible. Above the band gap, the optical 
absorption is important. When a plane wave is normally incident from the air 
to a semiconductor surface, the reflectivity of the power is 
which takes into account the absorption effec* when the refractive index E is 
complex and n, of the air is 1.

The polarization of the electric field given by Eq. (6.3.13a) is another 
characteristic polarization of the uniaxial medium since it is a characteristic 
mode of the medium from the fact that the fields (6.3.13a)-(6.3.13d) satisfy 
all of Maxwell's equations. This wave propagates with a wave vector deter- 
mined by Eq. (6.3,10). We note again that 
k - H = 0 since (B/lH) 
(6.3.14~) 
Thus the wave vector k is not perpendicular to the electric field E. The 
complex Poynting vector, E x H*, is therefore not in the direction of k. The 
solutions of the fields (6.3.13a)-(6.3.13d) are called extraordinary waves. 
The dispersion relation of the extraordinary waves is given by (6.3.10). On 
the other hand, the solutions of the fields (6.3.9a)-(6.3.9d), for which the 
wave vector k is perpendicular to E, H, D, and B, are called ordinary waves. 
The complex Poynting vector points in the direction of k. The ordinary waves 
behave the same as those in isotropic media with a permittivity E .  A summary 
of results of the ordinary and extrziordinary waves are shown in Fig. 6.3.

relation is given by-an ellipsoid in the k space: 
which is a result of rotating the ellipse of (6.3.16) around the optical 
axis. 
Special Cases 
1. If the wave propagates perpendicularly to the optical axis, for example,

It should be noted that the index ellipsoid is directly defined from the 
inverse of the permittivity function, and it contains information about the 
refractive indices of the characteristic polarizations. On the other hand, the k 
surfaces depend on the polarization and the direction of wave propagation. 
For a uniaxial medium, there are two k surfaces, one for the ordinary wave 
and the other for the extraordinary wave, with only one index ellipsoid to 
define the medium. The concept of index ellipsoid will be used again when 
we discuss electroptical effects in Chapter 12.

absorbed by the polaroid. This setup actually works as a light absorber, which 
can be used to absorb laser light to avoid stray light reflections in the

Optical Waveguide Theory 
This chapter covers topics on optical dielectric waveguide theory, which will 
be useful for studying heterojunction semiconductor lasers. We present the 
fundamental results in Section 7.1 for transverse electric (TE) and transverse 
magnetic (TM) nlodes in a symmetric dielectric waveguide including the 
propagation constant, the optical field pattern, the optical confinement 
Factor, and the cutoti conditions. We then discuss an asymmetric dielectric 
waveguide in Section 7.2. A ray optics approach is shown in Section 7.3, 
which explains the waveguide behavior. More practical structures, such as 
rectangular dielectric guides used in index-guidance diode lasers, are then 
discussed using an approximate Marcatili's method in Section 7.4 and the 
effective index method in Section 7.5. The results for a laser cavity with gain 
and Ioss in the media are derived to obtain the lasing conditions of a 
Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser cavity. Reference books on general wave- 
guide theory can be found in Refs. 1-4 if the readers are interested in more 
extensive treatment of the subject. 
7.1. SknaMETFUC DIELECTRIC SLAB WAVEGUIDES 
,I 
The dielectric slab waveguide theory is very important since it provides 
almost a11 of the basic principles for general dielectric waveguides and the 
guidelines for more complicated cross sections such as the optical fibers. Let 
us consider a slab waveguide as shown in Fig. 7.1, where the width cv is much 
larger than the thickness d, and the field dependence on y is negligible 
(d/iJy = 0). From the wave equation 
(G' + w ' ~ . E ) E  = O

VVe assume that the waveguide is symmetric, that is, the permittivity and 
thc permability are t. ancl p,. respectively, for Is( 2 d / 2 ,  and E ,  and p, for 
1 . ~ 1  < d / 2 .  The orisin h:~s been  chose:^ to be at the center of the guide, since

boundary conditions satisfied; the transverse spatial. profile and its polariza- 
tion remain unchanged while propagating down the waveguide.

7.1.1 Derivations of Electric Fields and Guidance Conditions 
for TE Polarization 
For TE polarization, the electric field only has an E, component: 
TE Even Modes. We obtain the guidecl mode solutions by exanlining wave 
equation (7.1.2), which h:ts solutions of the form {exp(i k , z ) ,  expf --ik,z)) x 
{exp(i k , x ) ,  exp(-- i k , x ) ,  or cos kL.x, sin k ,  x). Since the guide is trmslation- 
aIly invariant along the z direction, we choose exp(ik,z) for a guided mode 
propagating in the +z direction. We then choose the standing-wave solution 
cos k,rx or sin k,x inside the guide and exp(-as) or exp(+crx) outside the 
waveguide since the wave is a guided mode solution. 
With the above obse~qations, the electric field for the eve,n rrlodcs can be 
written in the form 

(a) Even modes 
(b) Odd modes

as shown in Fig. 7.23, whe.re k x ,  k,, and CY satisfy 
which are obtained by substituting (7.1.3) into the wave equation (7.1.2). 
Matching the boundary conditions in which E, and Hz are continuous at 
x = d / 2  and x = - d / 2 ,  we obtain 
where Hz = (l/icup)(dE,/dx) 
has been used. Note that the permeability is 
p ,  for 1x1 I 
d/2. Eliminating C, and C,, from (7.15a) and (7.1.5b), we find 
the eigenequation or the guidance condition: 
The above guidance condition also shows that iri order for E, of the form 
(7.1.3) to be a guided rnode solution, the standing-wave pattern along the 
transverse .t- direction or- the amount of oscillations (determined by k , d )  has 
to match the decay consttint a oatside ille guide. An interesting limit is to 
. 
consider that the decay rate LY is infiniteiy large, E,, will be zeru outside the 
guide, and (7.1.6) gives ii.,.d/") - ~ / 2 , 3 ~ / 2 ,  
. . . or i;,ycl - m r ,  which is 

the same as the guidance condition for a metaIlic.waveguide, of which the 
tangential electric field vanishes at the surfaces of the perfectly conducting 
waveguide. 
TE Odd Modes. The electric field call be written in the form 
as shown in Fig. 7.2b. Matching the tangential field components E,, and H, 
at A: = d /  2 or - d /  2, we obtain

7.1.2 Graphical Solution for the Guidance Conditions 
To find the propagation constant k Z  of the guided mode, we have to solve for 
.k,, k,, and a from (7.1.4a), (7.1.4b), (7.1.6), and (7.1.9). We rewrite the

We have only two unknowns, k ,  and cr. The solutions for a and li,, can be 
obtained from a graphical approach by looking at the (a d / 2 )  vs. ( k ,  d/2) 
plane [4, 51. 
Equation (7.1.1 1) appears as a circle with a radius 
in Fig. 7.3 and the two eigenequations (7.1.10a) and (7.1.10b) arc also plotted 
on the same plane. Their interceptions give the solutions for ( a  d / 2 )  and 
( k ,  d / 2 ) .  Here the refractive index inside the guide n, = \ / p , ~ ,

propagation constant k =  from either (7.1.4a) or (7.1.4b) after k ,  or cr is 
determined.

7.1.3 Cutoff Condition 
1 
It is clear from the graph that the cutoff condition occurs at R = rn 7 ~ / 2  
for 
the TE,, mode 
Thus the TE, mode has no cut08 frequency. (Note: Here we assume that the 
refractive indices are ind5p~rlci~nt 
of the fl-equency. Xn semiconductors, the 

frt:quency-dependent refractive indices should be used.) For 
there are (nz + 1) guided TE modes in the dielectric slab. --- 
For a single mode operation, the condition ( k ,  d/2)fi1: - n2 < ~ / 2  
is 
required. This puts a limit on o, d, or n: - n'. For example, given the 
wavelength h, in free space and the waveguide dimension d, 
If n7- is almost eclual to 12, as is the case in an A1,,.Gal-,As/'GaAs/ 
A.l,Ga, -,As wztvcguide, we have 
using nl - tr2 = 2rt1 A N .  For example, at n, = 3.6, we have An < 0.035 at 
A, = d. Single-mode operation is achieved with a small difference in the 
refractive index An < 0.035. 
7.1.4 Low- and High-Frequency Limits 
1. In the low-frequency limit, the waveguide nlodcs can be cut off. At 
cutoff? ((k0d/2)J-1'= 
HI ~ / 2 ,  and a = 0, as can be seen fi-om the 
gr.;lphicul soiution. (The cutoff condition can be achieved by reducing the 
frequency, or d, or ni - n'.) We find /i,,~1/2 = nz 7 1 2  and from (7.1.4h)

shows that ( k ,  d/2) --. (nr + l ) r / 2  and ( a d / 2 )  --.

Since m is a fixed mode number, we find that (a d/2) + R + m, as can also 
be seen from the graphical solution. Therefore, 
or k = u

= wrr,/c. The propagation constant k ,  approaches that in 
the waveguide since the mode decays rapidly outside the guide ( a  -, m). 
Most of the power is guided inside the waveguide, Fig. 7 . 4 ~ .  
7.1.5 Propagation Constant k, and the Effective Index n,, 
From Eqs. (7.1.17) and (7.1.181, we see that the propagation constant k ,  
starts from w f i  at cutoff and increases to w 4% 
as the frequency goes 
to infinity. The dispersion cuives k ,  vs. w\/poe, are plotted in Fig. 7.4a. An 
effective index for the guided mode is defined as 
Again we have the lowcr bound 
OV,LLE 
= 1 5  and the upper bound 
u d K / k , ,  = n, at the low- and high-frequency limits, and the dispersion 
curves in Fig. 7.421 map to a set of effective i i ~ d e x  curves as shown in Fig. 7.5a.

number w / c .  (t,) The normalized propagation parameter fi vs. the nofrnalized parameter V 
number for the TE,, modes. 
Very often a normalized propagation parameter 
is aIso plotted vs. the V number or normalized frequency 
in Fig. 7.5b, showing a set of universal curves for the lowest three TE modes. 
Notice that the above discussions assume that n and n, are independent 
of the frequency. In semiconductors, the dispersion effect of the refractive 
index near the band edge can be significant. It is important to know the 
refractive index at the operation wavelength rz(A). The effective index n,,(A) 
still falls betweer1 n ( h )  < nefl(h) < n,(h) when the material dispersion is 
taken into account.

band gap for AI,rGa,-,As with various aluminum mole fractions .r. For

alloys. 
More data and theoretical fits on GaAs, N,Ga ,-,, 
As, In ,-., Ga.,A,P, - Y ,

that the refractive index is gznerally dispersiCe near or above the band gap 
with a fast variation near various interband transition energies. It also 
depends slightly on the doping conce1;tration of the semiconductors, the 
temperature, and thi: strain. Above the bani! gap, both the real and the

and (7.1.10t3) for the even and odd modes, respectively.

The total phase delay (noting that the Goos-Hanchen phase shifts are

7.4 RECTANGULAR DIELECTRIC WAVEGUIDES 
The rectangular dielectric waveguide theory is very useful since most wave- 
gliides have finite dimensions in both the x and y directions. There are two 
possible classes of modes. The analyses are approximate here, assuming 
krl 2 d, as shown in Fig. 7.12. The method we use here is sometimes calIed 
Marcatili's method for rectangular dielectric waveguides [20, 211. These 
modes are 
1- HE,, 
modes or E&+I,(~+,, 
modes: H, and E,, are the domina- 
components. 
2. EH,, 
modes or E&+ l X q +  
modes: E ,  and H9 are the dominant 
components. 
In general, we have d j d z  = ik, and Maxwell's equations in the following 
-forn~s will be used as the starting equations in ,the later analysis for both

HE,,, and EH,,, modes: 
Here we have assumed that the permittivity is a constant in each region. 
7.4.1 
HE,, Modes (or Ef, 
+ ,, modes) 
Suppose we start with the HE,, 
modes. The large components are H, and 
E,.. The other components Ex, E z ,  H,., and Hi are assumed to be small. In 
principle, we can assume that H, = 0, and express Ex, E,, E,, and Hz in 
terms of H, using Maxwell's equations. These are called the HE,, modes or 
E;, modes. Alternatively, we can also assume Ex = 0, and express E,, H,v;' 
H,, and Hz in terms of E,. Since these are all approximate solutions, they 
have to be compared with the exact solutions [22, 231. We find that bbth 
approximations give essentially the same eigenequations with minor differ- 
ences. We call these modes HE,, modes, where p labels the nuniber of 
nodes for a wave function in the x direction and q for the y direction. The 
solution procedure is as follows. 
1. Solve the wave equation for H., 
everywhere:

Boundary Conditions. To derive the guidance conditions and the relations 
between the field coefficients C ,  -

1. At x = 0 and x = d, Hz and E,. are continuous. The other boundary 
condition for 6, continuous is ignored since E, is small. 
At x = 0,

which can also be seen from the ray optics approach. An intuitive way to 
understand the approximate boundary conditions is that for (i) at x = 0 and 
x = 11, the optical power density of interest is its x component bouncing back 
and forth between the two interfaces at x = 0 and d. We therefore need 
E,,Hib and HTE,. However, H, = 0. We need only E, and H_ and drop E, 
since it is small. For boundary conditions (ii) at y = 0 and w ,  we use only Hi 
and Ex, or N, and E- for the y component of the optical power density. 
Both pairs give the same results since H, is not of concern.

For the E q , ,  mode, the domlnant field components are E ,  and H,. We can

boundary conditions. iVt: use

tions are found ai'ter matching the boundary conditions,

Alternatively, we may assdme that E, = 0 and Ex is of the form (7.4.10), and

and mode patterns.

Example 
We consiclcr a rectanguiar waveguide where t h e  aspect ratio 
w / d  = 2, the refractive index of the waveguide rrl is 1.5, and the backgrou~d 
medium is free space 
= 1. We plot in Fig. 7.131, after Ref. 23, the 
normalized propagation constant p vs. a normalized frequency B = V/a, 
and 
where the V number is defined the same as that of a slab waveguide with a 
thickness d, 
The corresponding transverse electric and magnetic field patterns inside the 
dielectric waveguide are also plotted in Fig. 7.13b. Note the dual relations 
between the transverse electric field E : ~  of the HE,, 
mode and the trans- 
verse magnetic field H : ~  of the EH,, 
mode. We can see that the field 
patterns provide the information on the intensity variations of the Ex, E,, 
H,, and H, components of the waveguide modes (Fig. 7.13~). The intensity 
pattern of the HE,, mode is almost indistinguishable from that of the EH,, 
mode. Therefore, only one set of intensity patterns is shown. These mode 
patterns should be interesting to compare with those of the metallic wave- 
guides [24]. The results in Fig. 7.13a have been compared with those of Goell 
[22] with a good agreement. The original labels of the modes in Ref. 23 are 
slightly different. In Figs. 7.13a and b, we use our convention for the 
HE,,( = ETP+ ,xu+ 1) ) modes and tht EH,,(= 
E;,+ 
) modes, and the 
coordinate system is shown in Fig. 7.12, where the vertical axis is the x axis 
and the horizontal axis is the JJ axis. This coordinate system is chose11 such 
that when the width w + m, lhe resulls here approach those of the slab 
waveguides discussed in Sections 7.1-7.3 using the same coordinate system. 
Our convention is the same as those for Marcatili [20] and Goell [22] using 
the E?p+ ,,,,+I, 
and E & + ~ x ~ + I ,  
modes, except that our aspect ratio is 
~ / c l  > 1, where w is the width along the y direction instead of the x 
direction.

modal distribution as a function of x. This field distribution will also vary

the modal distribution will be a function of only y, called G ( y ) .  Thus the

It is interesting to compare the two eigenequations (7.5.1) and (7.5.2) 
obtained here with Eqs. (7.4.19) and (7.4.20) derived in Section 7.4. The 
I 
difference is that the "effective permittivities" appear in (7.5.2) in the 
effective index method, while the material permittivities are used in (7.4.20) 
in the previous approximate Marcatili method. When comparing the propa- 
yation constants with the numerical approach from the full-wave analysis, the 
I 
results of both Marcatili's method in Section 7.4 and the effective index 
methocl agree very well with those of ths numerical method, generally

Waveguide Couplers and 
Coupled-Mode Theory 
In this chapter, we discuss how a light can be coupled into and out of a 
waveguide, and how it can be coupled between two parallel waveguides or 
coupled within the same waveguide with a distributed feedback coupling. We 
present the coupled-mode theory for wave propagation in parallel wave- 
guides. An analogy of this coupling between two propagation modes in 
dielectric waveguides is a coupled pendulum system or a coupled LC res- 
onator system. The coupling of two resonators leads to energy transfer 
between two resonators at a frequency determined by half of the beat 
frequency of the two system modes: the in-phase mode and the out-of-phase 
mode. For coupling of propagation modes between two parallel waveguides, 
;t 
beat length can also be defined, which is twice the minimum distance 
required for the exchange of the guided power between the waveguides. 
Many interesting physical systems exhibit the phenomena of the coupling of 
modes, which can be understood from a simple model of two coupled 
pendulums. 
8.1 WAVEGUIDE COUPLERS 11-31 
-We discriss transverse couplers, prism couplers, and grating couplers and 
point out the significance of the phase-matching condition in this section. 
8.1.1 Transverse Couplers 
Ilirect Focusing. As shotvll in Fig. 8.1, a lens is used to focus and shape the 
beam profile so that it is matched to the modal distrihutio~~ 
it1 the waveguide. 
'The coupling e.fficie11cy depends on the ovsrlap integral between the field 
profile of the incident wave and t t ~ c  li~~d;il 
profile of the guided mode in the 
thin film. This configuratii:,n can achieve   early !.GO% efficiency. However, it 
may not be suitable for gent.r:~I intsgratcd optics applications because of the 
ilorxplnnr~.r configuration.

End-butt Coupling. As shown in Fig. 8.lb, the efficiency of an end-butt 
coupling can be controlled by the gap width t ,  the waveguide dimension d 
and refractive indices of the waveguide and the substrate, n, 
and n,, 
respectively. 
8.1.2 Prism Couplers 
For a waveguide mode, the propagation constant P along the z direction has 
to satisfy the conditions, k,n, < P < k,n, and k,n, < P < k,n,, where 
lio = 2.rr/ho is the wave number and ho is the wavelength in free space. For 
an incident plane wave from region 0, its horizontal wave number is k ,  = 
kon,sin 8, < lion, for any real incident angle Bi. "Thus, .the wave cannot be 
phase matched to the guided mode since k,no < P, Fig. 8.2b. The excitation 
of the guided mode is very weak. However,, using a prism above the wave- 
guide with a small gap (assuming n, > no and n, > n,), Fig. 8.2a, the 
phase-matching condition can be satisfied: k,n,sin 8, = P, Fig. 8 . 2 ~ .  This 
angle of incidence 8, will be larger thanthe critical angle for the interface

The reflected wave is E, = $E,(s, r). Since the boundaiy condition requires 
that the tangential electric field vanish at the conductor surface, the reflected

Phase Matching Condition for Grating Couplers. A dielectric grating can 
therefore be used as a waveguide input or output coupler, as shown in 
Fig. 8.5. Suppose we have a dielectric slab waveguide with a propagation

5.2.1 Energy Conservationl Condition 
Let us consider two resonators, 1 and 2, coupled through a capacitor as 
shown in Fig. S.6b. Without the coupling capacitor, each variable a,(t) or 
~z,(t) satisfies the differential equation of the form (8.2.5) with a resonant 
frequency o, or w,, respectively. With the coupling capacitor, ,they satisfy 
This assumes that the coupling is weak; thus--the coupling coefficients 
1K,,I ((: w ,  and IK,,( -c o,, and the energy stored in the coupling capacitor 
is negligible. A similar coupling system, a coupled pendulum system, is shown 
in Fig. 5.7. 
Therefore, from energy conservation in which the total energy in two 
resonators should stay as a constant (neglecting the energy storage in the 
weak coupling capacitor),

Since a, and a ,  are arbitrary (defined by the e.nergy and phase in each 
resonator), we conclude that the two coupling coefficients must be related by

and /a,(t)lZ = 1 - la,(r)('. Since I Kz, 
< 1, we find the peak energy 
transferred to resonator 2 is lK,, /L!lZ, which means that the energy transfer 
from resonator 1 to 2 is never 100%. The energies la,(t)12 and l~-1,(t)1~ 
are 
plotted in Fig. 8.9a. We see that the energy transfers periodically between 
two resonators with a period T = rr/n = 271-/(w+- w-). The "beat" angu- 
lar frequency w, = w ,- 
- w = 2!2 determines the energy exchange rate. This 
frequency splitting, as shown in Fig. 8.8a, is larger than the original energy 
difference before coupling, w ,  - w ,  = 2A. In other words, the two frequen- 
cies appear to "repel" each other in the coupled resonator system.

onators is a coupled quantum-well system. The in-phase mode for two 
coupled quantum wells has a lower eigenenergy than that of the out-of-phase

the

PI,, ktrh = Knl,, ancl lib,, - &,, have been assumed here. In general, we can 
always use the more accurate parameters yo, y,, k,,, and k,,, if necessary. 
The power transfer from waveguide b to waveguide a is determined by 
Therefore, we have complete power transfer at Kt' = w/2, 3 ~ / 2 ,  5 ~ / 2 ,  
etc., only at w = w,, P,, = P,, A = 0 and 4 = K,, = K,,,(= K ) .  For a fixed 
coupler length L' = ~ r / 2 K ,  for example, an incident light with a wide 
spectrum on waveguide b, the output optical power in waveguide n will 
contain signals of frequences close to w,. The directional coupler acts as an 
optical filter. Furthermore, if the materials are electrooptical so that we may 
apply a voltage to change the refractive indices n, and n,, the intersection 
frequency w ,  will be tunable. 
Optical wavelength filters using waveguide couplers have been reported 
for Ti:LiNbO, and InGaAsP/ InP materials. The In ,_,Ga, As,, PI -, 
/ InP 
material system is especially interesting because of its applications at 1.3 or 
1.55 p m  wavelengths and its potential for optoelectronic integrated circuits. 
The experiment reported in Ref. 44 has two-coupled waveguides: one has a 
narrower guide width d, = 0.42 pm, but a larger refractive index n, than n, 
(obtained following Ref. 45) with y, = 0.127; the other has a guide width 
d, = 0. .: p m  and y, = 0.075. The galIium mole fraction x u  (or x,) depends 
on the arsenic mole fraction y, (or y,) for lattice matching. The input power 
is assumed to be I in waveguide b. The output power from waveguide a ,  P,, 
peaks at 1.12 p m .  We have applied the improved coupled-mode theory and 
compared our theoretical results (solid and dashed lines> with the experimen- 
tal results (open circles) in Fig. 8.17. The 
reported in Ref. 44 
used for the theoretical calculations are within the measurement accuracy. 
?'he possible reasons of discrepancy may be that (1) there is still some 
difference between the tl~eoretical model in Ref. 45 and the experimental 
values for the refractive index, and (2) the losses in the waveguides are not 
taken into account. However, the comparison shown in Fig. 5.17 shows very 
good agreement in general.

only if A" 
0 and Kt' = (2n2 + l)7r/2, where 
= 0, 1,2,. . . . We call this 
a cross state 8 when the total power is transferred from one waveguide to 
the other. These cross states are represented by only discrete points labeled 
as @ on the vertical ( K O  axis. 
Using ti:,. electrooptical effects, which are discussed further in Chapter 12, 
the refractive indices in the waveguides can be changed by an applied voltage 
bias. The refractive index difference between two waveguides, or the mis- 
match factor A = (p, - P,)/2, can be tuned by the voltage. Therefore, we 
can switch the directional coupler from a cross state at Kt' = ~
/

(and 
A = 0) to a parallel state, shown as the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 8.19. 
8.5.3 The ilp Coupler 
It is difficult to achieve switching in the design of a single-section waveguide 
coupler since the coupling coefficient is a function of the spacing and the 
material parameters; these parameters are harder to adjust in the fabrication 
processes. It is generally easier to control coupling by an applied voltage to 
change Ap = Pb - P,,. 
A two-section waveguicle coupler has been proposed [46] to achieve 
switching with more flexibility, as s h o w  in Fig. 5.20. The amplitudes a ( z )  
and b ( z )  for a coc~pled waveguide configuration as shown in the first half 
szction of Fig. 5.21) are related to thc initi:~l conditions by

where K is the coupling coeffi- 
cient of the two identical guides, find the expressions for the 
electric field profile at the outprlt facet and its far-field radiation 
pattern. Use the approximates for the TEo mode profile in (a) and 
(b) for simplicity. Explain how one may control the radiation 
pattern using the directional coupler.

(a) Find the far-field pattern due to the TE, mode using the numeri- 
cal values from PI-oblem 7.1 of Chapter 7 on the output facet of a 
diode in the 8, 
direction. For simplicity, assume that the TE, 
mode i iiniform in the y direction froin - kV to + W, and D is 
very largc: (see Fig. 5.5). Plot the power pattern VS. 0, 
roughly. 
(b) Consider a directional coupler with three identical guides as in 
part (a). Using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from Problem 8.3, 
plot (i) the three electric field profiles of the coupled waveguide 
system and (ii) the far-field radiation pattern P(0, ) of the three 
eigenmodes, assuming that the waveguide center-to-center spacing 
is A,,/ 2, as shown in Fig. 5.34.

Optical Processes in Semiconductors 
The quantum theory of light has been an intriguing subject since 1900 when 
Planck [I] proposed the idea of quantization of the electromagnetic energy. 
In this theory, the light or the electromagnetic wave with an oscillating 
frequency w is quantized into indivisible packets of energy Ftw. In 1905, 
Einstein [2] proposed that the photoelectric effect could be explained using a 
corpuscIe concept of the eIectromagnetic radiation. With the invention of 
lasers, quantum theory of light also plays an important role in our under- 
standing of many optical and electronic processes in materials such as 
semiconductors. Rigorous in-depth treatments of the quantum theory of light 
can be found in Refs. 3 and 4. 
In this chapter, we study the optical transitions, absorptions, and gains in 
semiconductors. We start with the Fermi's golden rule, using the time-depen- 
dent perturbation theory derived in Section 3.7. We discuss the Einstein A 
and B coefficients for spontaneous and stimulated emissions and show how 
they can be calculaF -d quantum mechanically. A formal density-matrix ap- 
proach can also be L. :d to derive the optical absorption and gain coefficients 
in semiconductors and is shown in Appendix I. 
We then discuss the optical processes in bulk and quantum-well semicon- 
ductors. The optical matrix elements are derived based on Kane's model for 
the semiconductor concluction and valence-band structures. For serniconduc- 
tor quantunl wells, valence-band mixing effects play an important role in the 
optical gain of a clunntum-well laser. We show how these heavy-hole and 
light-hole band mivi~lg effects can be taken into account in the modeling of 
gain spectrum in quantum-well structures.

OPTICAL TRANSITIONS USING FERhII'S GOLDEN RULE 
C'onsicfrr a semiconc1ucto1- illuniinated by light. The interaction between the

J-Ian~il toni:~n [5] 

where I U ,  is thc free electron mass, e = -lei for electrons, A is the vcctor 
poterltial accounting for thc presence of the elect]-omagnetic field, and V(r) is 
the periodic crystal potential. The above Hanliltoniarl can be understood 
because taking the partial derivatives of H with respect to the momenturn 
variable p and the positiorl vcctor r will lead to the classical equation of 
motion described by the Lorentz force equation [5] in the presence of an 
electric and a magnetic field (see Problem 9.1). 
9.1.1 The Electron-Photon Interaction Hamiltonian 
The Hamiltonian can be expanded into 
= H,, + H' 
-. 
where H ,  is the unperturbed Hamiltonian and H' is considered as a 
perturbation due to light: 
., 
The Coulomb gauge (discussed in Section 5.1) 
C - A = O  
has been used such that p A = A . p, noting that p = (it/i)C. The last term 
e2~'/2nz,, is much smaller than the terms linear in A, since leA/ -s< Jpl for 
most practical optical field intensities. This can be checked using p - Zzk = 
0 
frr/a,,, where a ,  - 5.5 A is the lattice constant. Assuming the vector

unit vector in the direction of the optical electric field, we have 
since the scalar potential cp vanishes ( p  = 0) for the optical field. Thus the 
Poynting vector for the power intensity (w/cm2) is given by 
-

P 
which is pointing along the direction of wave propagation k,,. The time 
average of the Poynting flus is simply 
noting that the time average of the sin2(.) function is 1/2. Thus, the

9.11.2 Transition Rate due to Electron-Photon Interaction 
The transition rate for the absorption of a photon (Fig. 9.la), assuming an 
electron is initially at state E,, is given by Fermi's golden rule and has bcen 
derived in Section 3.7 using the time-dependent perturbation theory: 
where Eb > E, has been assumed. Similarly the transition rate for the 
emission of a photon (Fig. 9.lb) if an electron is initially at state E,, 
is

We can see that the factors containing A; are canceled since the linear 
optical absorption coefficient is indepetldent of the optical intensity, which is

Similar procedures apply to (9.1.37) and (9.1.38). 
9.2 SPONTANEOUS AND STIMULATED EMISSIONS 
In Section 9.1, we presented a quantum mechanical deviation for optical 
absorption of semiconductors in the presence of a monochromatic electro- 
magnetic field using Fermi's golden rule. Here we discuss the spontaneous 
and stimulated emissions in semiconductors and derive the relations between 
the spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, and absorption spectra 
[4, 6, 71. 
First we consider a discrete two-leveI system in the presence of an 
electromagnetic field with a broad spectrum (Fig. 9.2a). The total transition 
rate per unit volume (s- 'cm-') is given by

The expression 
OPTiCAL PF.C("ESSI:S Ti4 SEMICONDUCTORS 
is the number of photons per state following the Bose-Einstein statistics for 
identical particles (photons), and a factor of 2 accounts for two polarization 
states for each k vector. The photon field can be described by a plane wave 
for simplicity as 
9.2.1 Density of States for the Photons 
To define the density of states for the photon field, we use the periodic 
boundary conditions that the wave function should be periodic in the x ,  y, 
and z di-rections with a period L .  Therefore, 
The volume of a state in the k space is therefore ( ~ T / L ) ~  
(Fig, 9.2b). Using 
the dispersion relation for the photon, 
where c/n, is the speed of light in the medium with a refractive index rz,, we 
can change the sum over the k vector to an integral. 
Let us look at the integral using the number of states with a difierential 
volume in the k space d 5 k / ( 2 n / ~ ) '  = k' dk d f 2 / ( 2 7 r / ~ ) ~ ,  
where d R  is the 
differential solid angle,

which is the number of states with photon energy E,, per unit volume per 
energy interval, crnA3(ev)- l, and E,, = E, - E, is the energy spacing be- 
tween the two levels. Note that the Ylanck constant /z instead of h is used in 
(9.2.8). 
9.2.2 Spontaneous and Stimulated Emissions: 
Einstein's A and B Coefficients 
Define 
as the transition rate per incident photon within an energy interval, (eV/s). 
We obtain the upward transition rate per unit volume (s-I ~ m - ~ )

spectrum or incoherent light (blackbody radiation)

Thc ratio of the stimuIated and spontaneous emission rates is

single photon with E = h o )  instead of a light spectrum, we use r-$f( E), that 
is, the net upward transition rate per unit volume per energy intervaI from

discussed. The crossing point F2 - F ,  in the gain spectrum serves as a good 
way to estimate the carrier density in a 1ase1- diode or a light-emitting diode 
in addition to matching both the gain and the spontaneous emission spectra. 
More details 011 the gain spectrum and the population inversion condition, 
izo < F, - F,, are given in Sections 9.3 and 9.4. 
9.3 INTERBAND ABSORPTION AND GAIN 
For interband transitions between the valence band and conduction band of 
a sen~iconductor, we have to evaluate the optical matrix element, using either

The vector potential for the optical field is A(r) = A e i k ~ ~ . '

The Bloch functions for electrons in the valence band E, and the conduction 
band E, are, respectively, 
where cr,.(r) and cl,(r) are the periodic parts of the Bloc11 functions, and the 
remainders are the envelope functions (plane waves) for a free electron. The 
momentum matrix elemen t is

where we noted that [u;(rXII/i) V'u/r)] and [u;(r)uu(r)] are fast varying 
functions over a unit ceJl and are periodic, while the envelope functions are 
slowly varying functions over a unit celL Therefore, the integral over d3r can 
be separated into the product of two integrals, one over the unit ceJl l1 for 
the fast varying part, and the other over the slowly varying part. Alternatively, 
for an integral 
(9.3.6) 
where F(r) is slowly varying over a unit cell, we may use the periodic 
property of the Bloch periodic functions 
(9.3 .7) 
where the G's are the reciprocal lattice vectors: 
= L LeG! e'G ·(c+R)F(r + R) d 3r 
R 
G 
n 
(9.3 .8) 
the R's are the lattice vectors, and exp[iG . R] = 1. Since F(r) is slowly 
varying over a unit cell, we may approximate F(r + R) '" F(R) and put it 
outside of the integral over a unit cell. Therefore, 
(9.3.9) 
where l1 is the differential volume d 3r when we consider the sum 
of the envelope function over the whole crystal. Note that the orthogonal 
property fnu;u u d 3r = 0 has been used in (9.3.4). Also note that from 
<"'al"'a) = <"'bl"'b) = 1, the normalization conditions for ue and U u are 
O/l1)fnu;ue d 3r = (l/l1)fu~u u d3r = 1. From the matrix element (9.3.4), 
we see that the momentum conservation 
(9.3.10) 
is obeyed. The electron at the final state has its crystal momentum like equal 
to its initial momentum IIku plus the photon momentum IIkop- Since

is the lattice constant of the semiconductors, which is typically of the order of

5.5 A and is much smaller than An, we may ignore k o p and obtain
(9.3.11 )
which is the k-selection rule in
the optical
trans: nons. Notice that the
interband momentum matrix element,
PCL:' depends only on the periodic
parts (u c and u) of the Bloch functions and is derived from the original
optical momentum matrix element Pba' which, on the other hand, depends on
the full Bloch functions (i.e., including the envelope functions).
9.3.2
Absorption
Using the k-selection rule, we find that the absorption coefficient (9.1.25) for
a bulk semiconductor is
(9.3.12b)
where the Fermi-Dirac distributions for the electrons

and in the conduction band are, respectively

the conduction band is empty, t,

The proper momentum matrix elements Ie . PeLf for bulk and quantum
wells are discussed in Section 9.5. It is important to note that the momentum
matrix element is isotropic for bulk cubic semiconductors, and it is polariza-
tion dependent for quantum-well semiconductors. Theory and experiments
on polarization-dependent gain in quantum-well structures based on Kane's
model [13] have been investigated [14-20]. The momentum matrix Ie . PCI,,1 2

from Fig. 9.10. The materials are lnO.53GaU..nAs quantum wells lattice-

concentration, Fig. 9.10a, that only n = 1 electron and hole subbands con-
tribute to the gain. The gain for TE polarization is larger than that of the TM
polarization since most of the holes occupy the heavy hole subband. At a
higher carrier concentration in a quantum well with a larger well width in
Fig. 9.10b, the second electron and hole subbands are occupied and features
like double steps appear in the TE gain spectrum.

MOl\tlENTUM MATRIX ELEi\lENTS OF BULK AND QlIANTUM-
WELL SEMICONDUCTORS
In a bulk semiconductor, the optical matrix element is usually isotropic.
However, in a quantum-well or superlattice structure, th e optical matrix
element will depend on the polarization of the optical electromagnetic field
[14]. In Kane's model for the semiconductor band structures near the band
edges, as discussed in Section 4.2, the electron wave vector is originally
assumed to be in the z direction. The wave functions at the band edges have
also been obtained as
I~, ±
~ ) for heavy holes, It + t> for light holes, and
I-!, + i) for spin-orbit split-off holes.

Consider a quantum-well structure with the growth axis along the z
direction. In general [141, the z axis for the p-state functions does not have to
coincide with the z axis for the quantum-well structures. However, when
averaged over the angle in the plane of the quantum well, it is found that the
same matrix elements for both polarizations give the same results as those
obtained assuming that both z axes coincide with each other.

matrix element for TE polarization (e = x) due to the transitions from the

INTERSUBBAND ABSORPTION
In an n-type doped quantum-well structure, intersubband absorption is of
interest because of its applications to far-infrared photodetectors [21-23], for
example.
In
this section, we study the infrared absorption [24J due to
intersubband transitions in the conduction.nd of a quantum-well structure
with modulation doping. We assume that tile doping is not large enough so
that screening or many-body effects due to the electron-electron Coulomb
interaction [25J can be ignored. The far-infrared photodetector applications
using intersubband transitions are discussed in Section 14.5.

centration N. However, if the concentration is too high, the screening, band
bending, and many-body effects [25] will be important as they affect the
energy levels and, therefore, the peak absorption wavelength. The occupation
of the second level N z will also decrease the absorption.
•
Example
We consider GaAs / Al O.3Ga O.7As superlattice structures, as shown
in Fig. 9.12, with a well width Wand a barrier width b. The absorption
o
spectrum is shown in Fig. 9.13a for a structure with
~V = b = 100 A and in
o
0
Fig. 9.13b for
~V = 100 A and b = 20 A. We can see that as the barrier width
o
b is reduced from 100 to 20 A the interminiband width is broadened because
of the strong coupling of well states. We assume a surface concentration of
N, = 2 X 10 ll/cm Z, T = 77 K and a linewidth T = 15 meV.
o
If we reduce the well width W to 40 A, th
.ntersubband transitions will
occur from the bound to the continuum minibands. The resultant absorption
spectrum is a broader spectrum with a longer energy tail at the high-energy
side, as shown in Fig. 9.13c. Here we use the same N, = 2 X lOII/cmZ and a

A period of a quantum cascade laser [27] using intersubband transition between
£3 and £2' The barriers are A10Aglno.52As and the wells are In.,..p G a O.53 As materials. The
calculated values are £3 -
£2 = 295 me V and £2 - E, = 30 meV.
Samples A, B, and C were designed for the bound-to-continuum transition;
sample E was designed for bound-to-bound state transition and sample F for
bourid-to-quasibound state transition. It can be seen that the bound-to-bound
transition (sample) E has a large peak absorption spectrum with a narrow
linewidth. Sample F has a narrower spectrum than those of the bound-to-
continuum transitions in samples A, B, and C. These samples result in
different responsivities because the carrier collection by the electrodes also
play an important role. For example, the respon.. ";ity of sample F is larger
than that of sample E because the electrons arriving at the final (quasibound)
state can easily be collected compared with those in the final bound state of
sample E.
9.6.4
Intersubband Quantum Cascade Laser [27]
Intersubband lasers using a structure such as that shown in Fig. 9.15 as a
period have been demonstrated [27] recently. The laser structure was grown
with the Alo.4sIno.52AsjGao..nIno.5JAs heterojunctions lattice matched to
InP substrate by MBE. There are 25 periods of the active undoped regions,
with graded regions consisting of an AlInAsjGalnAs .superlattice with a
constant period shorter than the electron thermal de Broglie wavelength.
o
Electrons are injected through the 45-A AllnAs barrier into the E 3 energy
level of the active region, as shown in Fig. 9.15. The reduced spatial overlap
of the E J and E, wave functions and the strong coupling to the E I level in
an adjacent well- ensure a population inversion between these states. The
laser operates between the
E J and
£2 levels with an energy difference
E J -
£2 ;::::; 295 meV or an operation wavclength
>
4.2 /-Lill. The applied bias
field is around 100 kVjcm and the band diagram is as shown in Fig. 9.15,
where the graded region is ncar Hat-band condition. The estimated tunneling

:lxl
time into the first trapezoidal barrier is around 0.2 ps, Therefore, the filling
of the state E." is very efficient, while the intersubband optical-phonon-limited
relaxation time
T 32 is estimated to be around 4.3 ps at this bias field with a
reduced overlap integral. Since T3'2 is relatively long, the population inversion
can be achieved because the lower state empties with a fast relaxation time
o
(around 0.6 ps) due to the adjacent 28-A GalnAs well with £1 state. The
relaxation between the
£2 and
E 1 states is very fast because the energy
separation is equal or close to an optical phonon energy so that scattering
occurs with essentially zero momentum transfer. Finally, the tunneling out of
the last 30-A barrier is extremely fast (smaller than 0.5 ps), The laser emits
photons at a wavelength of 4.2 ,urn with a peak power above 8 mW in pulsed
operation. The operation temperature was as high as 88 K.

GAIN SPECTRUM IN A QUANTUM-WELL LASER
"VITH VALENCE-BAND-l\'lIXING EFFECTS
In Section 9.4, we present a simplified model for the interband gain of a
quantum-well laser based on the parabolic band structures. In quantum
wells, valence-band-mixing effects between the heavy-hole and light-hole
subbands are important and the subbarid structures can be highly non-
parabolic, especially for strained quantum wells, as discussed in Sections 4.8
and 4.9. In this section, we present a general theory for the gain spectrum in
quantum wells, taking into account the valence-band-mixing effects [26]. The
theory is applicable to both strained and unstr ined quantum-well lasers.
9.7.1
General Formulation for the Gain Spectrum with Valence Band Mixing
Our starting equation follows (9.1.25) for the absorption spectrum with the
delta function replaced by a Lorentzian function (9.1.31) to account for
scattering broadenings,

Notice that the form (9.7.17) or (S'.7.14) is similar to (9.4.9a) using the
parabolic band model. For a symmetric quantum well without an applied
electric field, we find that the two valence bands with
CT = U and
(J = L are
degenerate. The matrix elements turn out to be the same for
(J = U and L.
Therefore, the sum over
(J can be replaced by a factor 2 and only
g;,~) and
g;;) have to be calculated with the corresponding energy dispersion relation
E,~(k/).
In Fig. 9.16a, we plot the matrix elements 2Jvl(k,)/MJ using Eqs. (9.7.15)
and (9.7.16) for the TE polarization and the TM polarization for the first
conduction band to the first heavy hole subband (CI-HHl) and to the first

Inl-XGaxAsI-YPy quantum well lattice matched to InP substrate with a well
o
width of 60 A. The factor of 2 here accounts for sum over 0- of the hole spins
in the valence band (not in the conduction band). The conduction band spin
degeneracy of a factor of 2 is always included in the density of states. The
barrier Inl-xGa x As 1 _yPy
has a bandgap wavelength of 1.3 p.m
and
its
parameters can be obtained from Table K.3 in Appendix K. The valence
subband structures are plotted in Fig. 9.16b, with HHI as the top valence
subband. The nonparabolic behavior is clearly seen.
The gain spectra for both TE and TM polarizations are plotted in Fig. 9.17
for two carrier concentrations n. The surface carrier concentration is n s =
nls, and the gain coefficient in a period of a total width L T = L z + L b is
proportional to 1/L T instead of 1/ L z in (9.7.17). Here L b is the thickness of
the barrier. We can see that for a given carrier density,
the TE gain
coefficient is larger than that of the TM gain coefficient because the holes
will occupy the lowest subband which is heavy hole in nature, and the
conduction-to-heavy hole dipole matrix is mostly TE polarized as can be seen
from Fig. 9.16a. Similar behaviors for the GaAsjAJxGal_xAs quantum-well
lasers can be 'found in Ref. 26.

.Semiconductor Lasers
Semiconductor lasers are important optoelectric devices for opticalcomrnu-
nication systems. For a historical account of the inventions and development
of semiconductor lasers, see Refs. 1-3. The first semiconductor lasers were
fabricated in 1962 using homojunctions [4-7]. These lasers had high thresh-
old current density (e.g., 19 000 Ay cm") and operated at cryogenic tempera-
tures. The estimated current density [2] for room temperature operation
would be 50 000 A / ern 2• The concept of heterojunction semiconductor lasers
was realized in 1969-1970 with a low threshold current density (1600 A /cm 2 )
operating at room temperature [S-11]. These double-heterostructure diode
lasers provide both carrier and optical confinements, which improve the
efficiency for stimulated emission, and make applications to optical communi-
cation systems practical as transmitters.
In the late 1970s, the concept of quan tum-well structures for semiconduc-
tor lasers was proposed and realized experimentally [12-16]. The threshold
current dens. .; was reduced [16] to about 500 Ay cm'. The rec..iction of the
confinement region for the electron-hole pairs to a tiny volume in the
quantum-well region improves the laser performance significantly. The quan- .
tum-well structures provide a wavelength tunability by varying the well width
.'
and the barrier heigh t. These idevices are also excellent practical examples
for textbook problems on basic quantum mechanics, that is, the particle in a
box model.
In the late 1980s, strained quantum-well lasers were proposed to improve
the laser performance [17, l'S]. Superior diode lasers using strained quantum
wells reduced [19] the threshold current density to 65 A /cm 2 at
room
temperature. Further reduction in threshold current density using strain
effects has been possible' [20]. The threshold current density of semiconduc-
tor lasers has improved by approximately one order of magnitude smaller per
decade since their invention in 1962. The improvements resulted from the
development of novel ideas and a realizable technology such as liquid-phase
epitaxy (LPE), molecular-beam epitaxy (1V1BE), or metal-organic chemical-
vapor deposition (MOCYD) [21].
In the 1990s, research on strained q uantum-well lasers continued. with
remarkable progress toward high-performance diode lasers. Quantum-wire
semiconductor lasers ha ve been realized, The potential improvement using
quantum-wire and quantum-dot semicond uc to r lasers has been under investi-

gation both theoretically and experimentally [22-25]. Novel structures such as
surface-emitting lasers [26-28] and microdisk lasers [29, 30] have also been
realized. The microdisk lasers using a small disk with a radius R of the order
10 J.Lil1 and a thickness of 0.6 J.Lm show interesting resonator physics with
gallery-whispering-mode lasing characteristics. Many of these structures also
make research on the cavity quantum electrodynamics practical [31].
In this chapter, we study the basic semiconductor lasers and their physical
principles. Various important designs and their models arc discussed. Since
the research on semiconductor lasers and technology is so rapid, these
physical principles and theoretical models will provide a good tool to design
diode lasers with the desired characteristics, or to set up a foundation to
design novel laser structures with superior performance.

Energy Band Diagram and Carrier Injection
Let us first consider a P-InP/p-Inl __xGaxAsl_yPy/N-InP double hetero-
junction [32, 33] structure. Before the formation of the heterojunctions, the
energy band diagram is shown schematically in Fig. 10.1a, where the energy
levels are all measured from the vacuum level. At thermal equilibrium
(Fig. lO.Ib), the Fermi level is a constant across the three regions. The band
diagram still contains the features of the bulk properties in the regions away
from the heterojunctions, assuming that the central region

the carrier lifetime

From the electron and hole concentrations, nand p, or the quasi-Fermi

Also, the leakage current I L may also be increased with an increase in I. The

to be
(10.1.35)
where Do JL accounts for any additional increase in the leakage current due to
the increase of I . A typical output power vs. injection current relation is
shown in Fig. lOA. Below the threshold injection current, the output light
intensity is negligibly small. Above threshold, the output power is linearly
increasing until saturation effects occur.
There are three possible reasons for saturation [33]:
1. The leakage current increases with the injection current J, i.e., 6.IL
=1= O.
2. The threshold current I th may also depend on the injection current J
due to junction heating. The increase in temperature reduces the
recombination lifetime
Tt!' For example, the Auger recombination rate
increases when the temperature is raised.
3. The internal absorption a int increases with an increase in the injection
current J.

Light-Emitting Diode vs. Laser Diode: The Role of Spontaneous
Emission vs, Amplified Spontaneous Emission
In Chapter 9, we discuss the spontaneous emission rSpon(hw) from a forward
biased p-n junction diode. The typical spontaneous emission spectrum is
commonly used in light-emitting diodes (LEOs). The band gap of semicon-
ductors is chosen such that LEDs in the visible region and the infrared region
can be designed with high quantum efficiency. For a simple planar structure
such as shown [37-39] in Fig. 10.5, the light emission from the top surface of
the cladding layer due to a spontaneously emitted photon will be limited by a
cone angle of 2ec ' where Bc is the critical angle between the p-type semicon-
ductor and the ai-. Light with an angle of emission outside of this c'e angle
will be reflected i.ack to the semiconductor region. Therefore, the g _ometric
design such as a hemispherical lens or parabolic lens above the p-n junction
diode has been used to optimize the light emission. Other important consid-
erations for visible LEOs include the responsivity of human eyes. "Infrared

LEDs for applications in optical communication are designed such that
efficient coupling into optical fibers can be achieved, as shown in Fig. 10.6,
with a surface emitter configuration [40]. The double heterojunction Al-
GaAs j GaAs structure also provides the carrier confinement to increase the
efficiency [41].
For a laser diode, the cavity design and the amplified spontaneous emis-
sion will be important for the formation of laser modes. To understand the
physics of the laser diode vs. light-emitting diode operation, we consider an
LED that is designed to have the same Fabry-Perot structure as an LD
except that its two ends are antireflection coated. If we measure the sponta-
neous emission power spectrum from the top or bottom of the diode, called

Analysis of the Amplified Spontaneous Emission
In a laser diode, the Fabry-Perot cavity provides feedback reflections of light
inside the cavity. We can understand the lasing action by looking at the
amplifiedspontaneous emission process below threshold. The intensity of a
Fabry-Perot mode inside the cavity satisfies [47, 48]

CK i is the net modal gain, f3
is a spontaneous coupling
factor which accounts for the fraction of the spontaneous emission photons
coupled into the

and
the factor 1/2 accounts for

propagating in the +z and -z directions. The solutions for the forward and
backward propagation light intensities are

The boundary conditions at z = 0, 1+(0) = R1r-(O) and at z = L, 1-(L) =

In reality, the optical output is not infinity; we may say that the net threshold
gain G; approaches (but is slightly smaller than) the mirror transmission
losses (I j 2L )In(l j R] R 2 ) · An interesting 1imit occurs when both facets arc
antireflection coated, R]
= R 2 =
O. We find
(10.1.55)
which is the same as the facet light power L F( trw) per unit cross section wd
as expected. We also note that the transmissivity T', = 1 - R 2 can also be
written as In(ljR z) when
R z ~ 1 because In[lj(l -
T 2 ) ] = lntl + Tz) =
Tz = (l - R z)· Therefore, the mirror loss in its distributed form
am =
(lj2L)ln(JjR 1R z) is used very often.
The evolution of the facet light or amplified spontaneous emission from a
laser diode as the injection current increases from below-threshold opera-
tions (I = 6 and 8 rnA) to near-threshold (r= 13 rnA) and above-threshold
operation (I = 15 rnA) is shown in Fig. 10.11. Note that the vertical scales
are not the same for the four figures. The lasing action starts to show
drastically when the injection current approaches the threshold level 03.5
rrtA). An expansion of the plot for the amplified spontaneous emission
spectrum at 8 mA was' shown in Fig. 7.17, where the Fabry-Perot mode
o
spacing can be seen clearly to be around 7.9 A for the laser with a cavity
length L
= 370 u.tt». The carrier concentrations n extracted from the gain
measurement below and near the threshold can be extracted and plotted as a
function of the injection current. Above threshold, the carrier concentration
in the laser diode is pinned at the threshold carrier density, since most of the
extra. carriers injected contribute to stimulated emission and output optical
power. Important issues on the mode fluctuations and temperature depen-
dence are discussed in Refs. 42 and 43.

GAIN-GUIDED AND INDEX-GUIDED

In this section, we study both gain-guided and index-guided semiconductor
lasers. The difference is in the lateral confinements of the optical mode and
the carriers. The index-guided semiconductor lasers have been demonstrated
to have superior performance to that of the gain-guided geometry. However,
the gain-guided structures are still use d because of their ease of fabrication.
They are
investiga ted here because many interesting physical processes,
includ ing carrier injection and diffusion, optical gain, and spatial carrier
profiles, can be extracted from these structures.

Stripe-Geometry Gain-Guided Semiconductor
Lasers l34, 38, 49-57]
A stripe-geometry gain-guided semiconductor laser is shown in Fig. 10.12,
where the metal contact is the stripe with a width S defined by processing
procedure. The injected current] spreads along the lateral (i.e., y) direction.
Therefore, the carrier density II distributes along the y direction determined
by the current spreading and the lateraldiffusion. The effective width of the
carrier density distribution and the gain profile along the lateral direction are
therefore wider than the stripe width S. This gain inhomogeneity along the y
direction provides the guiding mechanism for the optical mode confinement
in the lateral direction. An associated effect is the antiguidance due to the
reduction in the refractive index variation induced by the gain profile. In this
section, we study an approximate analysis method to model the gain-guided
stripe-geometry semiconductor laser.
Analysis of the Optical Modal Profile and Complex Propagation Constant.
We consider the TE mode with index guidance in the x direction, perpendic-
ular to the p-n junction plane, and with gain guidance along the y direction,
which is transverse to the propagation direction. The optical electric field is

Therefore,

spectrum depends on the local carrier density ni:y), a measurement of the
emission profile

will determine the density profile.
Therefore, the carrier density profile can be mapped out from the emission
intensity profile, and the results agree very well [50, 54] with the theoretical
curve calculated using (10.2.28), as shown in Fig. 10.14.

Index-Guided Semiconductor Lasers [33, 58, 59J

laser performance. index-guided structures have been used such that a better

For a ridge waveguide laser, an effective index profile n eff ( y) along the
lateral
y direction can be obtained using the effective index method by
solving the slab waveguide problem at a fixed cross section defined by a
constant
y. The guidance condition and the optical field pattern are then
obtained from the waveguide theory for the index profile n eff ( y), following
the procedures described (60] in Section 7.5. The effective index method can
also be applied to a rectangular dielectric waveguide structure as the active
region of the etched-mesa buried-heterostructure laser. We find the optical
electric field for the fundamental TE mode (or higher-order TE modes) from
(7.5.3):

current densities as compared with those for conventional double-hetero-
structure (OH) semiconductor diode lasers. Research on quantum-well physics
and semiconductor lasers has been of great interest recently. For a brief
history, sec Ref. 3. Various designs such as single-Quantum-well (SQW),
multiple-quantum-well (MQvV) and graded-index separate-confinement het-
erostructures (GRINSCH) have been used for semiconductor lasers [21]. As
we have seen in Chapter 9, quantum-well structures show quantized sub-
bands and steplike densities of states. The density of states for a quasi-two-
dimensional structure has been used to reduce threshold current density and
improve temperature stability. Energy quantization provides another degree
of freedom to tune the lasing wavelength by varying the well width and the
barrier height. Scaling laws for quantum-well lasers and quantum-wire lasers
show significant reduction of threshold current in reduced dimensions [24].

ation. The polarization-dependent momentum matrix element is listed in

Zero-Temperature Gain Spectrum
To understand the gain spectrum, let us consider the gain at T = 0 K.
Remember that the model here is oversimplified, since it does not include
the effects of scatterings or inhomogeneous broadenings such as those due to
well-width fluctuations and the electron-hole Coulomb interactions. Our
model here is to show the simplest picture for population inversion for the
optical gain process. At T = 0 K, the Fermi-Dirac distributions are step
functions. For the electrons in the conduction subband, we have
E<Fc

For unstrained quantum wells, the topmost subband is a heavy-hole subband.
The hole effective mass in the plane of the quantum well mrz

For an NIQW structure with
nIl' quantum wells and a cavity length L, the
required modal gain G th at threshold condition is
(10.3.30)
where ex is the internal optical loss, f w is the optical confinement factor per
well, and R 1 and R 2 are the optical power reflection coefficients at both
facets. We should note that gw is a "material gain" for the quantum-well
region assuming that all of the electron-photon interactions occur in the well
region and g w a 1/L z in the gain model. The optical confinement factor I'w
for a single well takes into account the optical modal distribution and only
that fraction of the photons inside the well provides gain. A simple approxi-
mation is, therefore [77],
f
=
w
( 10.3.31)
where
~Vmode is the "full width" at nearly half maximum of the intensity
profile of the optical mode. For a separate-confinement structure as in
Figs. 10.16a and b, we can calculate the optical confinement factor f o for the
optical waveguide part, ignoring the well region first, then use
(10.3.32)
where 1'0 takes into account the refractive index difference of the large
optical waveguide for optical confinement, and L::: / }Vmodc accounts for the
carrier confinement and stimulated emission. The modal gain for a single
quantum wellshould be
G =
rJ,.\.g\.\.

which is also the maximum achievable gain for a single quantum well. For n w

I tll =
(10.3.35)

where 17 is the internal quantum efficiency of the injection current. There-
fore, we can also plot the material gain (nwg w ) vs. the injection current
density (n wIw) using [72-78) (10.3.9):
tl wg w = tlwg+n(::~: 1+ 1]
assuming that the well-to-wel! coupling can be ignored for simplicity. This
relation is plotted in Fig. 10.24b for n w = 1, 2, 3, and 4. For n w = 1, as
shown in Fig. 10.~4a, the intersection with the horizontal axis is 1,\. = Ioe - 1
and
gw = O. When
J.... = 10 , we have gw = go' For n ;
= 2, we firrd that
2g w = 0 occurs at (2Iw ) = 2Ioe - 1; therefore, the horizontal intersection is
shifted to the right by a factor of 2. At 2Iw
= 21o, we obtain the vertical axis
(2g w ) = (2go), which is twice that for Il w = 1. Therefore, the gain-current
density curve for n w = 2 starts at twice the transparency current density of
that for J1w = 1, and increases by a factor of two faster than that for n ..... = 1.
We obtain the threshold current density by [72-76) substituting 00.3.29) into

STRAINED QUANTUM-WELL LASERS
In recent years, strain effects in semiconductors have been proposed and
explored
intensively for optoelectronic device
applications [79,
80]. The
tunability of strained materials makes them attractive for designing semicon-
ductor lasers, electrooptic modulators, and photodctectors operating at a
desired wavelength. The concept of band structure engineering [17, 18, 81] is
further explored in strained semiconductors beyond the previous applications
using quantum wells by controlling the well width and the barrier height.
Using strained material systems such as In1 __xGaxAs/lnP, In1_xGaxAsl
Inl_XGaxAsl_yPy, and Inl_xGaxAs/GaAs quantum wells, a wide tunable
range of wavelength is possible. Furthermore, the band structure including
the band gap, the effective masses, and therefore the density of states can be
engineered. It has been proposed that by using a compressively strained
quantum-well structure, semiconductor lasers with a lower threshold current
density can be achieved because of the reduced; n-plane heavy-hole effective
mass [17,
18, 81]. A reduced threshold carrier density also reduces the
nonradiative Auger recombination, one of the limiting factors for long-wave
length (1.55-fLrn) semiconductor lasers.
Experimentally, high-performance strained quantum-well lasers [82, 83],
such as low-threshold current density [19, 20, 84--89], high-power output
[90-93], and high-temperature operation [94-97]' have been demonstrated
I with remarkable results. Theoretical models using both simplified parabolic
band structures and realistic band structures of strained quantum wells have
also been used to investigate the optical gains in these semiconductor lasers
[98-105J.
To
understand
the
strained
quantum-well
systems,
we
will
use
the
111 1 _.lG~l .r As I InPmaterials as an illustration. The ternary In L_xGa xAs alloy
has a lattice constant
a(x), which is a linear interpolation of the lattice
t."( 1:1Sl.;:ll1 (S of GaAs and InAs. u( GaAs), and «(In.As):

o
The lattice constant of the InP substrate ao is 5.8688 A. When a thin
In l-xGa xAs layer is grown on the InP substrate, at x = 0.468 = 0.47, the
lattice constant of Ino.53Gao.47As is the same as that of InP. It is the
lattice-matched condition.
lfa(x) > a 0 (i.e., x < 0.47), an elastic strain occurs which will be com-
pressive in the plane of the layer resulting in a tensile strain in the direction
perpendicular to the interface. We call this case biaxial compression, or just
compressive strain. Similarly, if a(x) < ao(InP) (i.e., x > 0.47), the strain in
the plane of the layer is tensile and there is a compressive strain in the
perpendicular direction. We usually call this case biaxial tension, or tensile
strain. Theoretical work [106, 107] shows that beyond a critical layer thick-
ness, large densities of misfit dislocations are formed to accommodate the
strain. Therefore, the strained layer dimension is always kept below the
critical thickness for optoelectronic material applications.
10.4.1
The Influence of the Effective Mass on Gain and Transparency
Carrier Density
A band structure calculation shows that the effective mass of the heavy-hole
band along the parallel plane of a quantum well has a reduction in its
effective mass. Therefore, the density of states of the heavy-hole subband is
reduced. This helps to reduce the transparency carrier density required for
population inversion, as shown in Fig. 10.27. The Bernard-Duraffourg popu-
lation inversion condition [108] requires the separation of the quasi-Fermi
levels Fe - Fe + E g > hco > E g + Eel - E lzl (= E;fl}
For conventional semiconductors, the heavy-hole effective mass is always
several times that of the electron in the conduction band. The quasi-Fermi
level of the hole is usually above the valence band edge instead of being
below the band edge, while the conduction band degenerates easily with
electron population.
Since
a large separation of the quasi-Fermi levels
F; - F; + E g > E;ff (the effective band gap of the quantum well) is required,
an ideal situation will be a symmetric band structure configuration such that
nlh = m;, as
shown in
Fig.
10.27b. The population inversion condition
F, - F( + Es = E;ff can then be satisfied easily at a smaller carrier density,
as shown. If we take the simplified model for the peak gain [62, 64] from the
previous section, 'then

intersection point t. = t, determines the transparency density n If' at which
the peak gain is zero. This transparency density n tr is reduced when the mass
rate is reduced from R

Fig.

at a smaller value when n increases, since gm

Band Structure of a Strained Quantum ","'eU
For a quantum-well structure such as an In I _.~Ga x As layer sandwiched
between InP barriers, the band structures are shown in Fig. 10.30 for (a) a
compressive strain (x < 0.468), (b) no strain (x = 0.468), and (c) a tensile
strain (x > 0.468). The left-hand side shows the quantum-well band struc-
tures in real space vs. position along the growth (z ) direction. The right-hand
side shows the quantized subband dispersions in momentum space along the
parallel (k) direction in the plane of the layer. These dispersion curves show
the modification of the effective masses or the densities of states due to both

the quantization and strain effects. More precise valence band structures can
be found in Section 4.9.
Example: Gain Spectrum of a Strained Quantum Well
Using the formulation
for the gain spectrum in a strained quantum well, we plot in Fig. 10.31 the
gain spectrum for light with a TE (x or9) or TM (i) polarization for the
three cases in Fig. 10.30. We consider an In1_xGaxAs quantum-well system
with In l_xGaxAs l-yPy barriers (band-gap wavelength Au = 1.3 j.Lm) lattice-
matched to InP substrate. Electronic and optical properties of similar quan-
tum-well structures were shown in Figs. 4.22a-d, Fig. 9.16, and Fig. 9.17. As
shown in Fig. 10.31a for compressive strain (quantum-well gallium mole
fraction x = OA1, well width = 45 A) and Fig. lO.31b for the lattice-matched
o
case (x = OA7, L:; = 60 A), the gain of the TE polarization is always larger
than that of the TM polarization, because the top valence subband for these
two cases is always heavy hole in nature and the optical matrix element for
Cl-HH1 transition prefers TE polarization. The injected holes populate
mostly the ground (HH1) subband. On the other hand , Fig. lO.31c shows-that
the TM polarization may be dominant for the tensile strain case (x = 0.53,
o
and
L ;; =
15 A). The well widths are chosen such that all
the lowest
band-edge transition wavelengths are close to 1.55
I-Lm. The gains were
o
calculated for the sam e total width L y
= L z + L b = 200 A in a unit period,
where L;
is the barrier width. The same surface carrier concentration

as k t increases, as shown in Fig. 10.32, using the valence-band mixing model
in Section 9.7 and ignoring the spin-orbit split-off band. Laser actions with
the above polarization characteristics, TE for compressive strain and lattice-
matched Quantum-well lasers and TM for tensile strain quantum-well lasers,
have been reported [111J. These phenomena also agree with those in conven-
tional externally stressed or thermally stressed diode lasers [112, ] 13].

sive) < L. (lattice-matched) < L. (tensile). As discussed in Section 10.3, it is

where L, will cancel with the factor OIL z ) in g. Therefore, it is more useful
to compare the modal gain fg for three different strains if the well width L,
varies. We see that the compressive strain quantum-well
laser has the
smallest transparency carrier density at which g =
O. However, it also satu-
rates faster than the other two cases. On the other hand, the tensile strain
case (TM polarization) has a larger transparency current density, yet it
increases faster, implying a larger differential gain.
We can also plot the radiative current density
(10.4.12)
where the well width factor L z is canceled, since rSpon(hw) a. 1/L z from

The peak optical gain can also be plotted vs. the radiative current density Jr ad
directly for three strains, as shown in Fig. 10.35. We see that the compressive
strain case has the lowest transparency current density and its gain saturates
faster as the current density is increased. In real devices, the injected current
density has other losses, such as nonradiative Auger recombination and
intervalence band absorptions, which have to be added to the horizontal axis
to obtain the true
G-J relation. If these loss current densities are less
sensitive to
strains, we would expect the threshold gain G lh = r gIll
to
determine the threshold current density by the intersection of the G-J curve
with a horizontal line G
= G th . We see that for a small G th the compressive
strain laser will have the smallest threshold current density. On the other
hand, if G th is large, the tensile strain laser may have the smallest threshold
current density. These G-J curves provide good design rules for strained
quantum-well lasers.
An empirical G-J relation using the logarithmic dependence
(10.4 .15)
as discussed in Section 10.3 has also been used to study strained quantum-well
lasers with very good agreement with experimental data [75, 76, 114]. The
major equations are the same as those discussed in Section 10.3 and are not
repeated here. The same analysis using 00.3.35)-00.3.42) has been applied
to study strained quantum-well lasers.
Advanced issues such as Auger recombination rates [l1S-U8], tempera-
ture sensitivity [119], and high-speed carrier transport and capture in strained
quantum wells [120, 121] are II nder intensive investigation. Many-body effects
[122, 123] due to carrier-carrier Coulomb interactions on the gain spectrum
have been investigated. Many of these require more theoretical and experi-
mental work to fully understand the physics of strained quantum-well lasers.

COUPLED LASER ARRAYS
Coherent high-power semiconductor laser arrays [124-137] have been of
considerable interest recently. Shown in Fig.
10.36 are two examples of
gain-guided and buried-ridge semiconductor laser arrays [125, 130]. The
concept of coupled laser arrays is very similar to that of the antenna arrays.
Since the amount of power of a single element semiconductor laser is limited
because of its small size in the radiation aperture (facet), a coupled array is
expected to deliver a higher power with a narrower radiation pattern (i.e., a

better directivity) if the elements are properly excited. The challenging
research issues in laser arrays are how to excite the desired (fundamental)
mode without wasting optical powers to different sidelobes.
In pririciple, for a given semiconductor laser array, the optical modes
should be calculated [134J by solving Maxwell's equations for a given gain and
index profile, which is determined by the injection and coupling conditions.
Here we present a supermode analysis for its simplicity and ease of under-
standing the operation of laser arrays. The supermode analysis for a coupled
laser array follows closely the coupled-mode theory [126]. The optical electric
field can be written as a linear combination of the field of each element,

= L an(z)E(n\x, y)

(10.5.1 )
where E(n)(x, y) refers to the optical electric field in the 11th element before
the coupling effect is taken into account. The coupling effort is included in
the coupling coefficient K assuming only nearby coupling.

As we can see in Fig. 10.37, the highest-order mode t = 5 has alternating
amplitudes with zero crossings between the elements. This out-of-phase
mode tends to dominate the lasing behavior of the laser ar-nys because the
overlap of the optical field with the gain profile is maximized for this mode.
When the optical field goes to zero between adjacent elements, the mode
experiences a minimum of optical absorption between the emitters. There-
fore.rthe laser threshold gain is minimized for the out-of-phase mode and it
will lase first with enough injection current. Lasing of this out-of-phase mode
is undesirable since it gives double sidelobes in the radiation pattern. Various
schemes have been used to improve the laser array performance [133, 134].

are represented by vertical bars. The corresponding far-field patterns are
shown in Fig. 10.38b. We can see that for the fundamental (t =

highest (t = 10) order modes, the amplitudes are not uniform throughout
the elements.
To improve the uniformity of the near-field profile, the two outermost
waveguides are chosen [128] to have
a smaller spacing to increase the
coupling coefficient by a Ii factor, with all the other guides equally spaced.

The lowest and the highest supermodes have a uniform near-field intensity
envelope and the injected charges will be utilized more efficiently. These
supermodes should be relatively stable with increased pumping above thresh-
old. Another design is to use a Y-junction waveguide [129] str .ture such that
all waveguide modes will lase in phase with equal amplitudes.
Using closely spaced antiguided waveguides [133, 134], a new class of
phase-locked diode laser arrays has been developed. Fundamental array-mode
operation in a diffraction-limit-beam pattern is obtained up to 200 rnW. The
out-of-phase mode is also shown to lase with 110 mW per uncoated facet.
The threshold currents of these antiguided arrays have been shown to be in
the 270- to 320-mA range with an external quantum efficiency near 30 to 35%
and cw operation up to 200 m W, As pointed out before, the real optical
modal profiles in the
laser arrays using gain-guided [132] or antigu ided
[134-136] structures have to be calculated properly to compare with experi-
mental data. The supermode analysis is presented in this section only to
provide some basic understanding of the laser array characteristics.

propagation constant f3 from the Bragg wave number tTl/A, where t
refers
to the order of the grating mode used in the OFB process. We can see that
the periodic structures provide an optical frequency selection property. In
Fabry-Perot-type semiconductor lasers, there are many longitudinal modes
within the gain spectrum, which is generally broad. Although there are some
side-mode suppressions in cw operation of the semiconductor lasers above
threshold, the powers of the side modes increase rapidly when the laser
diode is pulsed at high bit rates. In optical communication systems with
common chromatic dispersion in optical fibers, these undesirable side-mode
power partitions limit the band width of the information transmission rate.
Therefore, a mode selectivity provided by periodic structures such as dis-
tributed feedback lasers or distributed Bragg reflectors are attractive for
applications
for
single
longitudinal-mode operation
of diode
lasers.
A
schematic diagram of a distributed feedback (OFB) semiconductor laser is
illustrated in Fig. 10.39, where a grating above the active region provides the
optical distributed feedback coupling. Using the coupled-mode theory in
Section 8.6, we summarize the results for the optical electric field in a

emitting laser. As a matter of fact, a DBR laser is just a Fabry-Perot laser
with a mirror reflectivity varying with the wavelength. The lasing threshold
occurs at the wavelength for which the overalI reflectivity is maximum. The
analysis is very similar to that of a Fabry-Perot laser except that r 1 and r 2

From the threshold gain 00.6.31) or 00.6.34), the threshold current density

Stable single-mode operation of semiconductor lasers using DFB and
DBR structures has.been
achieved. The temperature
stability of these
structures has also been demonstrated. In a conventional Fabry-Perot semi-
conductor laser,
the lasing wavelength

dominated
by
the
temperature
coefficient of the
peak gain wavelength
dAp/dT, which
is approximately 0.5 nm y degree for long-wavelength In-
GaAsP/ InP double-heterostructure lasers [139].
On the other hand, for
DBR and DFB lasers, the lasing wavelength is dominated by the temperature
coefficient of the refractive index, dn/dT, which is approximately 0.1 nrn y'
degree. Therefore, a stable fixed-mode operation of a DBR or DFB laser
over a wide range of temperature (> 100 degrees) has been achieved [139].

SlIRFACE-El\tIITfING LASERS
Recently, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VeSEL) [26-28, 142-147]
have been developed with performances comparable to those of conventional
Fabry-Perot
edge-emitting diode
lasers.
A
few
schematic diagrams
are
shown in Fig. 10.41. The light output is orthogonal to the plane of the wafers.
This change in the direction of laser emission drastically changes the design,
fabrication scalability, and array configurability of semiconductor lasers.
The concept of surface emission from a semiconductor laser dates back to
1965 when Melngailis reported [148] on a vertical cavity structure. Later
different groups reported on the grating surface emission [149, 150] and
4SO-corner turning mirrors etched into the device [15;n. Major work on
VeSELs was done [147, 152J after 1977. More recently many improvements
with significant progress on the performances of the VeSELs have been
demonstrated. Because of their short cavity lengths, the 'surfuce-ernitting
lasers have inherent single-frequency operation. They have other advantages
such as wafer scale probing and ease of fiber coupling. Therefore, VCSELs
have potential applications for optical interconnects, optical communication,
and optical processing.

where d is the active layer thickness, L is the cavity length, 'Y =
2 if the thin
active layer is placed at the maximum of the standing wave, and 'Y = 1 for a
thick active layer. The factor d / L
accounts for the longitudinal optical
confinement, and S is the transverse optical confinement factor. The symbol
(t accounts for the optical absorptions inside and outside the active region,
plus any diffraction loss due to the mode mismatches when the laser mode
propagates to the reflecting mirrors. This diffraction toss depends on the size
of the diameter of the active region and the locations of the mirrors.
10.7.2
Carrier Injection and Optical Profile
Depending on the fabrication processes and the structures of the surface-
emitting lasers, the current distribution, the carrier density profile, and
the optical mode pattern vary. For example, as shown in Fig. 10.42a, the
ion-implanted regions act as insulators and the injected current into the
active layer will have a distribution as shown in Fig. l0.42b. The guidance of
the surface-emitting laser in the transverse direction is the same as that for
the gain-guided stripe geometry diode laser, except that here the injection
profile has a circular cross section instead of a long stripe geometry, and the
light propagation is along the vertical
direction
instead of the parallel

g ( r) = go In -----;;;:

(10.704b)
where go and no are constant parameters. Approximate analytic formulas
can be found in Ref. 153.
For the surface-emitting laser in Fig. 10.41b, the device has been etched
all the way through the active region to provide lateral carrier confinement.
The top structure has a cylindrical semiconductor region with air as the
outside region. The interface scattering and diffraction losses also provide a
certain degree of mode selectivity and the fundamental (EH 11' HE lJ
or
TEM oo) mode of a rectangular or cylindrical waveguide is considered to be
very important.
In the following, we show the experimental results from Ref. 144. In Fig.
10.43, we show the near-field patterns of a I5-j1.m-square VeSEL with a
structure (using a shallow implant range of about 1 u.tt: with a proton dosage
of 3 X 1015j cm 2 at 100 keV) at various current injection levels above tl. esh-
old. At a small injection current above threshold condition, the fundamental
TEM on mode (called the EH oo mode in Chapter 7) lases with a full-
width-half-maximum of 7.8
j1.m, as shown in Fig. 1043a, and its lasing
wavelength is 9500.85 A, as shown in the emi~sion spectrum in Fig. 10.44a.
As the current increases, the lasing mode changes to a TEM o 1 mode, shown
o
in Fig. 1O.43b, with a lasing wavelength
9~05.90oA, shown in Fig. 10.44b, and
then shifts to a TEM 10 mode lasing at 9517.40 A, shown in Fig. 10.43c and in
Fig. J0.44c over a small range of current. At an even highe r current level,
both the TEM 00 and TEM II modes lase with the total near-field pattern
shown in Fig. 10.43d, and their emission wavelengths are 9516.92 and 9523.80
oA, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10044d. The mode pattern in Fig. l0.43d can
be spectrally resolved due to the wavelength difference of the two modes and
is shown in Fig. 10.43e, where the TEM an and TEM II modes are clearly
separated in the near-field image.
The red shift of the lasing wavelength is caused by the junction heating as
the injection current increases. The narrow linewidths of the lasing spectra
also indicate that the laser emits a single transverse mode, since the wave-
length separations between two udjaceni transverse modes are around J to '2
A for the gain-guided VC:SELs

Modulation of Light

11
Direct Modulation
of Semiconductor Lasers
For a semiconductor laser, the output power of light intensity P increases
linearly with the injection current above threshold, as discussed in Section
10.1, Eq. (10.1.31):
hco
In(l/R)
P = qTfi cr.L + In l/R (1 - 1tlt )
Therefore, for an injection current with a dc component and a small signal ac
modulation,
1=10+i(t)
we expect the optical output power to have corresponding dc and ac compo-
nents (Fig. 11.1):
P(t) =Po+p(t)
.>
In this chapter, we study the direct current modulation of diode lasers and
some intrinsic effects, such as relaxation oscillations, modulation speed, and
the laser linewidth theory. Our goal is to understand how the laser light
output characteristics vary as /we increase the modulation frequency of the
injection current.

Rid E EOUATrONS AND LINEAR GAIN AI'iAL'(SIS
accounts for the carrier loss due to radiative and nonradiative recombina-
tions. The time constant
T generally depends on N, but is assumed to be a
constant for simplicity. The term Lg(N)S is the carrier loss due to stimulated
emISSIOns.
In the second rate equation 01.1.2) for photon density S, the first term
rL!g(N)S, is the increasing rate of the number of photons per unit volume
due to stimulated emissions. The second term, - S/ Tp ' is the decreasing rate
of the photon density due to
absorptions and
transmission through the
mirrors of the laser cavity,

R
p
(11.1.4)
where
T p
has the physical meaning of the average photon lifetime in the
cavity. Photons disappear from the cavity via absorption processes or trans-
~~mission out of the end facets. The last term,
{3R sp ,
is the fraction of
spontaneous emission entering the lasing mode, which is generally very small.
The spontaneous emission factor {3 can be calculated with a simple analytical
expression for index-guided laser modes with a plane phase front (5]. For a
gain-guided laser with a cylindrical constant phase front, the spontaneous
emission is shown to be enhanced by another factor [6, 7].
It is noted [3] that the optical confinement factor r
appears only in
01.1.2). This is because the optical mode extends beyond the active region d
by the factor r. The two rate equations ensure that the total carrier and
photon numbers are balanced taking into account the difference in the
thicknesses (d versus d / I ).

saturation effect can be ignored, we have a simplified gain model:

SElVIlCONDUCTOR LASER SPECTRAL LINEWlDTH
AND THE LINEWIDTH ENHANCEMENT FACTOR
The spectral properties of semiconductor lasers have been investigated since
the early 1980s. Experiments by Fleming and Mooradian [28] showed that the
laser spectral linewidth has a Lorentzian shape and the linewidth is inversely
.p roportional to the op tical output power. However, the magnitude of the
.linewidth was much larger than they had expected from conventional theo-
ries. A model proposed by Henry [29, 30J explained the phenomena by noting
that the se mico nd uctor laser is similar to a detune.d oscillator, an d there is a
spectrum linewidt h e nha ncement due to the coupling between the amplitude
and phase fl uctuations of the optical field . A linewidth enhancement factor
0'<, is introduced

Experimental data [33] for the laser linewidth 6./ depending on the op tical
output power with an inverse law are shown in Fig. 11.6. The surprisingly
large linewidth measured in this set of data was explained by Henry [29] using
the correction factor (l + a ~), where a e = S. More measurements have been
done for various semiconductor lasers including index-guided double-hetero-
structure,
unstrained
and
strained
quantum-well
lasers,
with
reduced
linewidth enhancement factor [34, 35] a e .
In a semiconductor laser, the injected carrier-ind uced refractive index
change is associated with the change in the gain. The linewidth enhancement
factor a t can be directly expressed in terms of the differential change of the
refractive index per injected carrier vs. the differential gain:

The linewidth enhancement factor
LYe vs. wavelength of two types of strained
MQW lasers. The lasing wavelength is indicated by the arrows. (After Ref. 14.)
where we have used dn"/dN = (-1/2)(dg/dN)/(21T/A) in 01.3.10) with
w / c = 274/A, and A as the wavelength in free space. The linewidth enhance-
ment factor varies from about 1.5 to 10 and is dependent on the lasing
wavelength. Experimental data of
Q'e for two strained quantum-well lasers
are shown in Fig. 11.7. The high-speed modulation characteristics of these
lasers are shown in Fig. 11.4.
The dependence of
CI.' <: on the loss or the Fermi levels of semiconductor
lasers has also been shown to be important [36]. For strained quantum wells,
theoretical analysis [37] shows that
Q'e can be reduced to about 1.1 using
tensile strains with TM polarization of semiconductor quantum-well lasers.
Similar behavior to the spectral broadening in semiconductor lasers also
occurs in an intensity modulator using the electroabsorption effects [38-40].
This is because a phase modulation due to the change in the refractive index
is associated with the change in the absorption coefficient.

Electrooptic and Acoustooptic Modulators
In this chapter, we discuss eleetrooptic effects and modulators. The bulk
electrooptic effects are discussed first, and their applications as amplitude
and phase modulators are presented. These devices using waveguide struc-
tures are then shown. The basic idea is that the optical refractive index of
electrooptic materia Is, such as LiNbO3' KH 2 P04 , or GaAs, and ZnS semi-
conductors, can be changed
by an applied electric
field. Therefore, an
incident optical field propagating through the crystal with a proper polariza-
tion experiences efficient electrooptic effects. The transmitted field changes
in either phase or polarization, which can be used in the designs of phase
modulators as well as amplitude modulators. We then discuss scattering of
light by sound and present a coupled-mode analysis for acoustooptic rncdu-
lators.
12.1
ELECTROOPTIC EFFECTS AND AMPLITUDE
MODULATORS [1, 2]
To understand the electrooptic effects, we consider a crystal described by the
constitutive relation associating the displacement vector D to the electric
field E by a permittivity tensor E.

The coordinate system iILwhich £ is diagonalized is called the principal

12.1.1
Electrooptic Effects
In a linear clcctrooptic material, the
index ellipsoid is changed
in the
presence of an applied electric field F, and K i j becomes K i j + 11 K i} , where
the change 11 K i j is linearly proportional to the electric field:

E u 11K,} = L r i j k r,
k=J
(12.1.7)
The linear electrooptic effect is also called the Pockels effect, after. Friedrich
Pockels (3] 0865-1913), who described it in 1893. These ri j k coefficients are
also called Pockels coefficients. Equation (12.1.7) can also be generalized to
include the quadratic eicctrooptic effects. which are usually smaller than the
linear effects,

However, for materials with centrosvmrn ctry, the index ellipsoid function
must be an even funct ion of th e applied el ectric field, since it must remain
invariant upon the sign reversal of the el ectric field. Therefore, r i j /.; vanishes
and the quadratic e1cctrooptic effects dominate. The quadratic electrooptic
effect is also called the Kerr effect, after John Kerr [3] (1824-1907), who
discovered the effect in 1875. From the symmetry property of the crystal, the
following matrix correspondence is defined:

ELECT1l00P'flC EFFECTS iN \YAVEGUIDE DEVICES
In Chapter 8, we discussed optical directional couplers using parallel wave-
guides. Here we d iscuss briefly the applications of electrooptic effects in
waveguide structures. We have discussed the use of KDP and LiNb0 3 in
electrooptic amplitude and phase modulators. Some of these materials, such
as LiNb0 3, as electrooptic crystals have been used in many commercial
devices. Here, we discuss the use of GaAs in electrooptic waveguide devices.
For integrated optoelectronics, semiconductor materials, especially III-V
compounds, are 'at tractive be cause many active and passive components, such
as semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, and field effect transistors, are made
of these compound semiconductors. However, considerable research work is
still necessary for integrating passive and active devices with desired opera-
tion characteristics.

maximum power. If they are out of phase by 180°, they will cancel each other.
Anther way to look at this is that if they add up to a first-order mode, it will
leak out over a very short distance, since the waveguide is designed to guide
the fundamental mode only, resulting in a destructive output. A plot of the

where the input power is assumed to be 1. Since 6.f3 = f3a -
f3b = kn>63F3
= kn>63V/ d, we plot the output power Pa vs. 6.f3 t . Suppose we design the
modulator with a length t
such that Pa = 0, and Pb = 1, at 6.f3 = 0, i.e.,
K t =
7T/ 2. To switch to Pa = 1, and Po = 0, we require at least 6.f3 t = 137T,
assuming the field-induced change in the refractive index affects the coupling
coefficient negligibly. (Otherwise, we can calculate the field-dependent K
and still use the expressions for Pa and Pb in 02.3.7) and (12.3.8) to find the
output : -wers.) To switch from a cross state to a parallel state, the applied
volta ge Las to be large enough such that 6.f3 t = 131T is satisfied. A plot of
P, vs. 6.f3 t for K t =
7T/2 is shown as the thick solid curve in Fig. 12.9. We
also plot P; vs. 6.f3 t
for K t = 7T, and K t = 37T/2. We see that complete
switching from the
@ state to the 0) state is possible (fo r K t = 7T/2 or
37T/ 2). For K t =
'TT , where we start with the B
state at 6.{3 t = 0, it is
impossible to switch to the
Q9 state simply by ch anging 6.f3 t
alone. This fact
can also be checked 'with the switching diagram in F ig. 8.19.

SCATTERING OF LIGHT BY SOUND: RMIAN-NATH
AND BRAGG DIFFRACTIONS
The refractive index of a medium can be caused by a mechanical strain
produced by an acoustic wave; this is called the acoustooptic effect. A sound
wave creates a sinusoidal perturbation of the density, or strain or pressure of
the m.iterial. The induced change in refractive index can be described as
(12.4.1)
with
W s = the angular frequency, k , = the wave vector, k , = 2711 As' As =
wavelength, and Vs =
W s I k: s is the velocity of sound in the medium.

wave propagates acts like

Electroabsorption Modulators
Electrcabsorption effects near the semiconductor band edges have been an
interesting research subject for many years. These include the interband
photon-assisted tunneling or Franz-Keldysh effects [1-3J and the exciton
absorption effects [4-9]. With the recent development of research in scmi-
conductor quantum-well structures, optical absorptions in quantum wells
have been shown to exhibit a drastic change by an applied electric field
[10-13]' Wh i1e previous excitonic electroabsorptioris in bulk semiconductors
were mostly observed at low temperatures, sharp excitonic absorption spectra
in quantum wells have been observed at room temperature. These so-called
quantum-confined Stark effects (QCSE) [11, 12] show a significant amount of
change of the absorption coefficient with an applied voltage bias because of
the enhanced exciton binding energy in a quasi-two-dimensional structure
using quantum wells. The quantum-well barriers confine both the electrons
and holes within the wells; therefore, the exciton binding energy is increased
and the exciton is me
difficult to ionize. The analytic solutions for pure
two-dimensional and three-dimensional hydrogen models in Chapter 3 show
that the exciton binding energy of the Is ground state is four times larger in
the 20 case than in the 3D case (14]. The sharp excitonic absorption
spectrum with a small scattering linewidth shows the possibility of a big
change of the absorption" coefficient by an applied voltage bias. The change in
the absorption coefficient can be as large as 104 em - I in GaAs / Al xGa I-x As
quantum wells [10-13]. Interesting quantum-well electroabsorption modula-
tors at room temperature have be en the subject of intensive research re-
cently.
In th is chapter we discuss the theory for electroabsorptions with and
without excitonic effects. In Section 13.1 we present the effective mass theory
for a two-particle system: an electron-hole pair. The general formulation for
the optical absorption due to an electron-hole pair is discussed. We show
th at a change of variables from the electron and hole position coordinates r e
and 'It to thei r differe nce coordinates r
= r", -
r h and their center-of-mass
coordinates R lead to po ssible an alytical solutions [4, 5, 8, 9] when the
interaction potentia! is due
to (l ) an electric field
only, which leads
to
electroabsorption effe cts in whi ch a ligh t is incident , or (2) the Coulomb
interaction between the electron
'.lnd th e hole, which gives the excitonic

5YI
absorption when a light is incident, or (3) both an electric field bias and the
exciton effects.
Case 0), the Franz--Keldysh effect, is discussed

L3.2. The
exciton effects, case (2), are presented in Section 13.3. Both have analytical
solutions for direct band-gap semiconductors near thc absorption edge. Case
(3) in a quantum well, presen ted in Section ] 3.4, is called the quantum-con-
fined Stark effect. The general solutions are obtained using two methods:
One is based on a numerical solution of the Schrodinger equation in the
momentum space for an electron-hole pair confined in a quantum well with
an applied electric field [15]. The other method is based on a variational
method [11, 12], which is commonly used in the literature because of its
relative simplicity and accuracy especially for the bound state energy of the
Is excitons. Device applications including quantum-well electroabsorption
modulators [16, 17] and self-electrooptic effect devices (SEEDs) [18-20] are
discussed in Sections 13.5 and 13.6, respectively.

GENERAL FORMULATION FOR OPTICAL ABSORPTION
DUE TO AN ELECTRON-HOLE PAIR
In Chapter 9, we derive the general formula for absorption coefficient in SI
units:

nrcEumuw
(13.l.1b)
The absorption coefficient depends on the initial state Ii) with corresponding
energy r; and the final state if) with corresponding energy EJo The summa-
tion over the initial and final states taking into account the Fermi occupation
factor f( E) of these states gives the overall absorption spectrum. We also
note that the delta function accounts for the energy conservation and the
matrix element in (13.1. I a) takes into account the momentum conservation
automatically, as has been discussed in Chapter 9, where no interaction
between the electrons and holes is considered.

The Airy functions [27] Ai(Z) or Bi(Z) are the solutions. Since the wave

the Airy function Ai(Z) has to be chosen. The energy spectrum is continuous

Experimental Results for 3D and Quasi.2D Excitons
Experimentally, the linewidth y is always finite and increases with tempera-
ture. For example, in Fig. 13.4a, we show the absorption spectra [30] of a
bulk (3D) GaAs at four different temperatures, T = 21, 90, 186, and 294 K.
We can see that the exciton linewidth is broadened with an increasing
temperature. The absorption edge has a red shift since the GaAs bandgap

Ino.53Ga0.47As/Ino.52AI0.4sAs' (lattice-matched to InP substrate) quantum-
well structure at different temperatures in Fig. 13.4b. The quantum-well
structure has a quasi-two-dimensional character since the electron and hole
wave functions are confined in the z direction with a finite well width instead
of being restricted to the x-y plane as in the" pure" 2D case. It is expected
that the binding energy of the Is exciton in the quasi-2D structure will be
between the 3D value (,= R y) and 2D value (= 4R). Furthermore, we also
see the splitting of the 'heavy-hole (HH) exciton and light-hole (LH) exciton
in a quasi-2D structure, while we do not observe the HH and LH exciton
splittings in a bulk GaAs sample because of the degeneracy of the HH and
LH bands at the zone center of the valence-band structure. The energies and
absorption spectra of the HH and LH excitons are further investigated in
Section 13.4.

shift due to the electric field is quite clear and appears stronger than the
binding energy change with the electric field. Variational methods instead of
the above perturbation method for the band-edge energies have also been
used [44-47].
13.4.7
Exciton Absorption Spectrum and Comparison
With Experimental Data
Theoretical absorption spectrum for a single pair of transitions from the first
conduction subband to the first heavy-hole subband is shown in Fig. 13.6,
where the discrete Is bound state Ex = E i S contributes as a Lorentzian
spectrum, and the steplike density of states enhanced by the Sommerfeld
factor contributes as the high-energy tail.
With an applied electric field, the quantum confined Stark effects can be
measured from the shift of the peak absorption coefficient as a function of
the applied electric field. Figure 13.7 shows the polarization-dependent
/
optical absorption spectra for (a) TE and (b) TM polarizations [17, 48] with
estimated electric fields [13]. Theoretical results using the parabolic band
model [15] presented in this section and using a valence-band mixing model
[43] have been used to successfully match these experimental data, as shown
in Fig. 13.8. To understand these data, we make the following observations;
1. The exciton absorption peak energy depends on the band-edge transi-
tiop energy Ehi(F), which shifts quadratically as a function of the field,
minus the amount of the Is state exciton binding energy E 15 , which is
about 8 meV for the heavy hole exciton. The transition energies of the
heavy-hole and light-hole exciton peaks vs. the applied electric field are
shown in Fig. 13.9. The binding energy for a bulk (3D)GaAs R y is

a pure 2D exciton. A
quasi-two-dimensional quantum-well structure gives a binding energy
corresponding to an "effective dimension" between 2D and 3D. There-
fore, the binding energy of the quantum well is somewhere between 2D
and 3D.
As a matter of fact, since analytical solutions for the hydrogen atom
equation in an a-dimensional space have analytical solutions for an
integer a such as 2 and 3, the idea is to extend the general result for a
given a using the concept of analytical continuation. Using this ap-
proach, the oscillator strength for the bound and continuum states can

the binding energy calculated variationally, as discussed in this section,
with the analytical formula for binding energy·[49].
2. The TE oscillator strength for the heavy-hole exciton is approximately
three times that of the light-hole exciton. However, since the light-hole
exciton transition energy is already in the continuum states of the
heavy-hole transition, the spectrum would not show a 3:1 ratio.
3. The TM polarization spectra show that it is the light-hole exciton
transition which is dominant for this polarization as a result of the
optical momentum matrix-selection rule.

L will decrease the transmissivity T(O) exponentially. We may achieve an
infinite on / oft ratio using an
infinitely long cavity and obtain no light
transmission even for the on-state. If T(O) -;, 0, the insertion loss approaches
100%. Naturally, this is not desirable and an optimum design, which maxi-
mizes the extinction ratio and minimizes the insertion loss, is necessary. Note
that

SELF-ELECTROOPTIC EFFECT DEVICES
(SEEDs) [18-20, SO-56]
Interesting optical switch devices such as the self-electrooptic effect devices
have been demonstrated using the quantum confined Stark effects. These
devices show optical bistability and consist of a multiquantum-well p-i-n
diode structure with different possible loads, such as a resistor (R-SEED), a
constant current source, or another p-i-n multiple-Quantum-well diode (Sym-
metric or S-SEED). In this section, we discuss basic physical principles of an
R-SEED. As shown in Fig. 13.11a, the circuit equation is given by Kirchoff's
voltage law:

well diode V and the current lR is determined by the simultaneous solutions
of the above two equations. A graphical illustration of these two equations is
plotted in Fig. 13.11b, where the intersection points stand for the possible
solutions for I R and V.
As can be seen from Fig. 13.11b, when the optical input power Pin is
increased, the photocurrent is irtcreased, in general, and the number of
intersection points varies. For an optical power equal to P.
}, we have two
In,
intersection points A and E with corresponding voltages VA and VE . There-
fore, there are two possible output states: PO UI = T(VA)Pin, " which is higher
in output power, and
POU I = T(VE)Pin l' which is lower in output power
because of the transmissivity T(VA ) > r(VE ) (Fig. 13.llc). Once we increase
the optical input power to Pin,2' we find that there are three intersection
points, B , D, and F, with corresponding voltages VB' VD , and VF . Therefore,
the optical output powers through the diode are given by three possible
values: Pout = T(VB)Pin, 2 > T(VD)Pin, 2 > T(VF)Pin, 2 ' Increasing the optical
input power to P in, 3 , we have only two intersection points, C and G, with
corresponding voltages, Vc and .Ve . Therefore, we obtain the output powers
Pout = T(VC )Pin, 3 > T(VC )P in,3 '
The switching curve and the directions are shown in Fig. 13.11d. At a
small input power, Pin < Pin, l' the optical transmission power Pout = T( V)?in
is monotonically increasing with the input power P in' since the photocurrent
is small for a small incident optical power. Therefore, most of the reverse
bias voltage is across the diode and V is close to Va (VA < V < Va)' In this
range of voltage, the transmission coefficient is rather flat or monotonic. As
the input optical power exceeds
Pin, l' Pin.2 , and P in, 3 ' photocurrent will
appear in the circuit, and the voltage drop across the diode will drop from Vc
to Ve , where the transmission will drop from a high value T(Vc ) to-a low
value T(Ve ). After Pin> Pin, 3 ' the output power starts to increase again,
since
Pout = T(V)Pin increases as
Pin increases. This switch sequence is

In the reverse direction, if we switch down the optical input power from a
large value of Pin at H, it will go through H

at point E the voltage has to switch from VE to VA as we decrease the input

field can give nearly optimum performance [53]. .From the I-V curve of a
SEED (Figs. 13.11a and b), we see that negative differential conductivity
exists. A SEED oscillator [19, 52] can also be designed by a series connection
of a SEED and an L-C resonator circuit and the SEED is optically pumped
to produce a negative electric conductance in the photocurrent response. For
example, oscillators with oscillation frequencies from 8.5 to 110 MHz have
been demonstrated [52]. For the 8.5-MHz oscillator; frequency tuning by
changing the bias voltage of the SEED has a tuning rate 16.7 kl-Izy V, This
frequency tuning is caused by the change in the capacitance in the depletion
layer of the SEED with the voltage change. The capacitance can also be
changed optically by changing the optical power coupled to the SEED.

Photodetectors
Photodetectors play important roles in optical communication systems. The
major physical mechanism of photodetectors is the absorption of photons,
which changes the electric properties of the electronic system, such as the
generation of a photocurrent in a photoconductor or a photovoltage in a
photovoltaic detector. The performance of a photodetector depends on the
optical absorption process, the carrier transport, and the interaction with the
circuit system.
For intrinsic optical absorptions, such as interband processes in a direct
semiconductor, the general theory for the absorption spectrum has been
presented in Chapter 9. The interband absorption creates electron-hole
pairs. The carrier transport of these electrons and holes after generation
depends on the design of the photodetectors. In this chapter, we study
photoconductors, photodiodes using
p-n
junctions and
p-i-n
structures,
avalanche photodiodes, and intersubband quantum-well photodetectors. Our
focus is on
the understanding of the physical processes of the carrier
generation and transport. We derive the relation between the optical pr .er
and the photocurrents. Some important noises in these photodetectors are
also discussed. More extensive treatment of photodetectors can be found in

The above expression has a good physical interpretation. The term Go t A is
the total number of electron-hole pairs created per second in the sample
with a volume tA., The ratio
7 n/7/ gives the photoconductive gain, which is
determined by how fast the electrons can transit across the electrodes and
contribute to the photocurrent in the circuit before they can recombine with
holes.
As shown in Fig. 14.1, when an electron-hole pair is created, the pho-
tocurrent will be small if the electron and the hole immediately recombine
before they can be collected by the electrodes (i.e.; the recombination

T lI is much shorter than the transit time). On the other hand, when
the transit time
T( is short, a significant number of photogenerated electrons
will be able to reach the left electrode before they recombine with holes in
the semiconductor. To preserve charge neutrality in the semiconductor, the
left electrode will provide the same number of holes at the same rate as the
electrons reaching that electrode per second, resulting in th e photoconductor
current measured by the external circuit. For example, Tn I T(

lent to having ten round-trips taken by the electron before it disappears by
recombination in the photoconductor.

Noises in Photoconductors [6]

spectral density function for noises in photodetectors. Important noises such

Thermal Noise (also Johnson Noise or Nyquist Noise) [6-8]. In a photode-
tector, the random thermal motion of charge carriers contribute to a thermal

Il-l-P-l Superlattice Photoconductor [10, 11]
Recently, modulation doping in semiconductors has been introduced for
novel device applications. An interesting example is a GaAs doping superlat-
tice used as a photoconductor. For an extensive review of the compositional
and doping supe rlattices, see Refs. 10 and ] 1. Here we consider a GaAs
doped periodically n-type and p-type separated by intrinsic regions as shown
in Fig. 14.3a. The electric field profile Et.z') can be obtained by noting that
dE(z)/d z = p(z)/e, where p(z) = +qND in the n-doped regions, -qNA in
the p-doped regions, and zero in the intrinsic regions. Therefore, E(z)
is either a linear profile with a positive slope qND / e in n regions, a neg-
ative slope -qNA /e in p regions, or a zero slope in the intrinsic regions
(Fig. 14.3b). The potential profile for the conduction band edge Ec(z) =
-qcp(z) =
+qf~ooE(z')dz' is the integral of the electric field profile and is
shown in Fig. 14.3c.
For an incident light with energy above the band gap, the photogenerated
carriers will fall to the band edge and will drift or diffuse to the valleys of

This
enhancement of a long lifetime has been found to be many orders of
magnitude larger than the bulk carrier lifetime. Since the photocurrent
response is proportional to CaT,l' an extremely large responsivity using the

where the first term is due only to the voltage bias, and the last term is due to

within a diffusion length L p away from the depletion boundary can diffuse
(and survive) to the depletion region and be swept across the depletion
region by the electric field and collected as the photocurrent by the external
circuits. This means that the majority of the carriers on the p side have to

Therefore, the photocurrcnt is proportional to the generation rate G o, which
is proportional to the incidcnt optical power P o p t '
The problems with the p-n junction photodiodes are as folJows:
1. Optical absorption within the diffusion lengths L p and L" is very small ,
that is, over narrow regions of L p and L; near the depletion region.
Since L p and L" are very sm all, the contributions of the photocurrents
are not effective.
2. The diffusion process is slow, which results in a slow photoresponse if
the optical intensity varies with time.
3. The junction capacitance C , is simply cA /x w ' where
X w is the total
depletion wid th derived in (2.5.24) simplified for a hornojunction diode
with cp = CN = e :

RoA Product [15]. A useful figure of merit for the p-n junction photodiodes
is the RoA product. Since the photodiode is operated at zero-bias voltage in

the contribution to 1/(RoA) from the diffusion current on the n side of the

There can also be other contributions to RoA products, such as the genera-

reverse diode saturation current, and (3) the background radiation induced

Long-wavelength
p-i-n
photodiodes for
high-speed receiver applications are of great interest for optical communica-
tion systems. For high-sensitivity optical receivers, photodiodes with a small
junction area around a few tens of microns in diameter and a low doping
depletion region of a few microns are desired [16]. At low doping, the center
absorption region can be depleted at a small bias voltage and reduce the
tunneling leakage current. Most of the long-wavelength photodetectors use
In0.47Gao.53As grown on an InP substrate as the absorption region. The
leakage current in InGaAs
p-i-n
diodes is dominated by the interband
tunneling at high reverse-bias voltages and generation-recombination pro-
cesses at low voltages [17, 18]. Hybrid
p-i-n / FET receivers have been
assembled for high-speed photoreceivers, which offer better sensitivity than
other p-i-n photodiode receivers [16, 19]. Ultrawideband p-i-n photodetec-
tors have also been shown to have a great potential for high-speed applica-
tions [20] with an impulse response in the picosecond scale.

AVALANCHE PHOTODIODES
To enhance the photocurrent response, some built-in multiplication pro-
cesses may be utilized such that more photocurrents can be extracted in the
external circuits at a given optical illumination. Ideally, we would have a
single carrier-type photomultiplier; the carrier concentration will grow if
impact ionization occurs in a region with a large electric field. In semiconduc-
tors, both electrons and holes can impact ionize more electron-hole pairs, as
sh own in Fig. 14.7a. A schematic diagram for an avalanche diode is shown in

We now consider the special case in which only electrons can impact ionize.
Suppose we have an incident current density J/x) at a plane located at
position x (Fig. 14.8a). Over an incremental distance L1 x, the total generated
electron-hole pairs is a nL1x multiplied by In(x), since a nL1x is the number
of ionized electrons per incident electron in a distance Lix. Therefore, the
current density In(x + L1 x ) is the sum of the incident (or primary) current
density and the ionized (or secondary) current density:

Both Electron and Hole Capable of Impact Ionization
Let us write the complete coupled equations when both electrons and holes
cause impact ionizations in the presence of optical generation as well:

dx1p(x) = an(x)ln(x) + f3p( x )l p( x ) + qG(x)

Note that each impact ionization process creates an electron-hole pair, as
does the optical generation rate G(x) per unit volume. We see that the above
two equations lead to
:'1

or the total current density

( 14.4.14)
which is independent of the position, as it should be since this is a one-
dimensional problem. Any current passing through a surface at x has to be
the same at steady state. The two coupled first-order differential equations
can be solved using one of the two variables, for example, I n( x ):
where 1

By controlling the electron injection in the p region or the hole injection

the reverse biased voltage

can be determined [24-31]. They usually
increase very slowly at a low .reverse bias and show an exponentially increas-
ing behavior above a certain large bias voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.10. These
reverse bias voltages can be of the order of 30 or 40 V. Once M; and M p are
measured, an and {3p are supposed to be found from (14.4.27) and (14.4.28).
If both an and {3p are independent of the position x, the integrations can be
carried out analytically. We can express an and f3p in terms of M; and M p :

From the above discussions, we see that in order to determine the impact
ionization coefficients from the multiplication of photocurrerit, proper experi-
mental conditions [24-26] have to be met: (1) .Mn(V) and M/V) for pure
electron injection and pure hole injection, respectively, have to be measured
in the same diode, but not in complementary p + nand n +p devices, (2) the
primary injected photocurrent (without multiplication) must be determined
accurately as a function of bias voltage, and (3) the electric field should .be
slowly varying in space and uniform in the active region. The dependence of
the electric field on the position and bias voltage must be accurately known.
It
is not easy to meet
all of these conditions without
approximations.

Separate Absorption and Multiplication (SAM) APD [29, 30, 41, 42]. Vari-
ous contributions to the dark current of an APD have been investigated,
which include the generation-recombination via midgap traps in the deple-
tion region, tunneling of the carriers across the band gap and a surface
leakage current across the p-n junction in InGaAs APD, for example. When
the reverse bias is above a certain value before the breakdown voltage VB' it
has been found that the tunneling current is dominant, unless the doping
density ND in the absorption region can be reduced below a certain value in
which the tunneling current can be reduced to be smaller than the genera-
tion-recombination current. A separate absorption and multiplication struc-
ture has also been proposed (41] to reduce the tunneling current. The
geometry is shown in Fig. 14.12a, where a low-field InGaAs region is used as

the absorption region and the photogenerated carriers are swept into the
high-field InP binary region where
avalanche multiplications occur [16].
Since the InP layer has a larger band gap than that of the InGaAs absorp-
tion region, the tunneling current can be reduced. The electric field pro-
file E(z) = iE(z) can be obtained using the charge density profile p(z)
based on the depletion approximation at a large reverse bias voltage since
JsE(z) /Jz = p(z). Since
6 is slightly different in InGaAs and InP layers, a
slight discontinuity in Ei.z ) occurs at the InGaAs/InP interface.
Multiple-Quantum-Well APD. Heterostructure avalanche photodiodes have
been fabricated for high-speed low dark current operations [41-43] since the
late 1970s. Research on quantum-well photodiodes was started in the early
1980s. A plot of the excess factor F shows that the excess noise factor is
minimized if f3 p / an «
1 using electron injection or an / f3 p «
1 for hole
injection. In those limits, an ideal single-carrier-type multiplication process
will dominate, and the excess noise caused by the feedback process of the
impact ionization caused by the secondary electrons or holes in the opposite
direction can be minimized.
Ideas using multiple-quantum-well (MQW)
structures for APD applications have been proposed and explored both
theoretically and experimentally [44-52]. For example, consider GaAs /
AlxGal_xAs MQW structures as the impact ionization region for electron
injection
(Fig.
14.13).
Since
s e.r s «, = 2:1 cs s, = 0.67 fl£g'
fl E; = 0.33 fl £g), the electrons coming from the left barrier region will gain
a larger kinetic energy fl E; when entering the barrier region than that of the
holes traveling in the opposite direction. Therefore, the electron impact
ionization coefficient an will be enhanced compared with f3p • We expect
a n / f3p »

ments of the effective ionization coefficients an and f3 p show an enhance-
ment of a n / f3 p from 2 in a bulk GaAs to about 8 in a GaAs/AlxGa1_xAs

multiple-Quantum-well structure [45, 46] and M n , = 10 at an electric field
E = 250 kY/cm. It has also been reported [47] that this ratio cx n / f3 p varies
(not monotonically) with the aluminum mole fraction x. At higher values of
x
(~ 0.45) above the onset of indirect electron transitions, the noise is
increased.
Intersubband Avalanche Photomultiplier. Avalanche photomultipliers using
an intersubband type (bound-to-continuum state transition) in an
n-type
doped or p-type doped multiple-quantum-well structure have also been
proposed and investigated both theoretically [50, 51] and experimentally
[52-54]. The idea is to introduce electrons in the quantum-well regions by
doping the wells
n
type. Incident photogenerated carriers will "impact
ionize" those carriers confined in the wells and kick them out of the wells via
Coulomb interaction contributing to the avalanche multiplication current.
Since this is a single-carrier type of photomultiplication, the excess noise is
expected
to
be
minimized.
Experimental
results
on
this
intersubband
avalanche multiplication have been reported [52-54].
14.5
INTERSUBBAND QUANTUM-WELL PHOTODETECTORS
In Section 9.6, we discussed intersubband absorption in a quantum-well
structure. To provide carriers for the intersubband transitions, donors for
n-type electronic transitions have to be introduced in the quantum wells (or
barriers) to provide free electrons which will be confined in the well regions
at steady state without a bias voltage. When an incident infrared radiation
illuminates the QW detector, electrons may absorb the photon energy and
jump to a higher energy subband and be collected by the electrodes with an
applied voltage. Theory and experiments on intersubband absorption and
quantum-well intersubband photodetectors (QWIP) [55..:.87] have been inves-
tigated for long wavelength applications, which may be competitive with
HgCdTe detectors. The advantages include the mature GaAs growth and
processing technologies for
high
uniformity and
reproducibility.
For an
extensive review of the subject, see Refs. 86 and 87 and the references
therein.
For n-type multiple quantum-well photodetectors, the optical matrix selec-
tion rule shows that the optical polarization must have a component along
the growth (z) axis, i.e., it must be TM polarized, as discussed in Section 9.6.
For TE polarized light, the absorption is expected to be very small. However, .
for p-type doped quantum-well photodiodes, the valence-band mixing effects
due to the heavy-hole and light-hole states show that the x- and y-polarized
light can have as large an absorption coefficient as the z-polarized light
[87-90]. Therefore a normal incidence geometry is possible for p-type QWIP.
In this section, we discuss mostly n-type QWIPs because of their potential
for 3 to ~-,um and 8 to 12-,um photodetector applications. In Fig. 14.14, we

show two examples using (a) a-4SO-coupled QWIP and (b) a two-dimensional
grating-coupled QWIP. These designs provide the necessary polarization
selection rule such that the infrared radiation will have a component along
the growth direction of the multiple quantum-well absorption region. Our
theory in Section 9.6 shows that the absorption spectrum is a Lorentzian
function:
a(hw)
r/(27T)
= a o
2
2
(E 2 1 -
hw)
+ (r/2)
(14.5.1)
where the intersubband energy E 2 l = £2 - E 1 is the subband spacing in a
simple single-particle model as presented in Section 9.6. If the Coulomb
interactions and screening effects are included, E 21 will have a slight shift
due to the many-body effects [91-94]. The measured absorption spectrum
[87] for a bound-to-bound transition is shown in Fig. 14.15 as a Lorentzian
shape. Note that the absorption is dependent on 1<<t»2Izl<t»t>1 2 ; therefore, a
rotation of the polarization as a function of the polarization angle <t» mea-
sured from the TM polarization waveincident at a fixed angle of incidence
set at the Brewster angle 0B = 73° shows the polarization dependence [95,
96J in Fig. 14.16 a cos 2<t», as expected from the theory. At
<t» = 90°, the
incident light is polarized along the'TE direction (i.e., the polarization of the
incident radiation is perpendicular to the plane of incidence; therefore, it is
parallel to the quantum-well plank of the QWIP), and no absorption occurs
for this polarization.
Photoconductive Gain in Quantum Wells. For the bound-to-bound state
transition shown in Fig. 14.17a, the photoexcited electrons in the E 2 level
have to get out of the well either by tunneling or by thermionic emission (or
by other phonon or impurity scattering processes). It is therefore desirable to
design the £2 level to be close to the barrier energy such that the absorption

oscillator strength (i.e., the intersubband dipole moment) and the escape
probability can be optimized.
For a bound-to-continuum state transition (Fig. 14.17b), the electrons have
a greater probability to transport into the barrier region and be collected by
the electrode and contribute to the photocurrent, although the intkrsubband
dipole matrix between the ground state £1 wave function and the highly
oscill atory continuum-state wave function may be smaller. For a simplified
analysis [87, 97, 98], we look at Fig. 14.17b, where Pc is treated as an effective
capture probability for an incident current I p for both the case (a) bound-to-
bound and the
ca~e (b) bound-to-continuum transitions. Vie obtain Pc I p as
the fraction of incident current captured by the well and (l - Pc)Ip as the
remaining current transmitted to the next period. The incident infrared
radiation creates a photocurrent ip:

expand the solution l/J(r) in terms of these functions:

where G sums over all reciprocal lattice vectors. Therefore,
( n k IV In'k') = E C ( n k , n' k' , G) [;k - k' - G

Semiconductor Heterojunction Band
Lineups in the Model-Solid Theory [1]
Semiconductor heterojunctions and superlattices have been under intensive
investigation both theoretically and experimentally for th e past three decades.
The potential device applications using heterojunctions are tremendous. In
this appendix, we discuss a simplified model to determine the energy band
lineups of semiconductor heterojunctions based on the model-solid theory
. Jl -4]. The goal is to develop a reliable model to predict band offsets for a
wide variety of heterojunctions without the need for difficult calculations
such as in the local-density-functional theory or ab initio pseudopotential
method. The relation of the model-solid theory to the fully self-consistent
first-principles calculations can be found in Refs. 2 and 3.
The major idea is to set up an
absolute reference energy level. All
calculated energies can then be put on an absolute energy scale, allowing us
to derive band lineups. In the model-solid theory, an average energy over the
three uppermost valence bands (the heavy-hole, the light-hole, and the
spin-orbit split-off bands) E u•av is obtained from theory and is referred to as
the absolute energy level. The values of E;
av for different semiconductors
are usually tabulated [1] (Table K.2 in Appendix K) so that no calculations
for these values are necessary. These results should be compared with those
of the first-principle calculations whenever possible to justify the model. An .
estimate of the maximum possible error is about 0.1 eV. Band offsets should
be checked with experimental data such as those in Refs. 5-19. The model-
solid theory provides a simple guideline for estimating the band offsets for
materials, especially ternary compounds with varying compositions for which
experimental data may not be always available.

UNSTRAINED SEMICONDUCTORS
If materials A and B have the same lattice constants, we may have an ideal
heterojunction and there is no strain in the semiconductors. For this case, the
heavy-hole and light-hole band edges (E HH and E L H ) are degenerate at the
zone center, and their energy position is denoted as E u :

SOME EXPERIMENTAL REPORTS ON BAND-EDGE
DISCONTINUITIES
There has been a considerable amount of experimental data on band offsets,
mostly on unstrained systems. For strained semiconductors, the band offsets
are complicated by the deformation potentials, which also shift the conduc-
tion and valence-band edges. Therefore, fewer data are available for strained
heterojunctions.

Krarners-Kronig Relations
The induced electric polarization P in a material is due to the response of the
medium to an electric field E (ignoring the spatial dependence on r):

(E.l)
The integration over
T is from -
00 to t in the first expression, since the
response p(t) at time t comes from the excitation field before t. In other
words, the function X( T ) has the property that
for T < 0
(E.2)
i.e., the system is causal. Since
D(t) = coE(t) + Pt z)
we find in the frequency domain
D(w) = c(w)E(w)
by taking the Fourier transform of (E.3), where
Since X( T) is a real function (it is in the time domain), we see that
c( -w) = c*(w)

that is, the real part of c(w} is an even function, and the imaginary part is an
odd function of w. Another physical property of £(w) is that, in the high-
frequency limit, £(w) tends to eo, because the polarization processes PC!),
which are responsible for X, cannot occur when the field changes sufficiently

If integrating over a volume V enclosed by a surface S, we obtain Poynting's

i.e., the power flow out of the surface S equals the decreasing rate of the
stored electric and magnetic energies plus the power supplied by the source,

Since the two sources J I and J2 are distributed over finite regions, such as

fields due to J(1) and J(2\ evaluated at the positions of the other sources·
occupying volumes V2 and VI' respectively. This is the reciprocity relation.

be in the x-z plane without loss of generality:

The wave is generally elliptically polarized in the x-y plane with a propaga-
tion constant k = J( K 4 - K;) / K 2 . The wave vector is always on the x-y
plane since (j =

Equations (G.24) to (G.26) show that either the electric field is polarized in
the z direction and k 2 = K'1, or polarized in the y direction (since Ex = 0,
E, = 0 from (G.26)) and k 2 = K 2. Both waves are linearly polarized propa-
gating with different velocities. This birefringence is called the Cotton-Mou-
ton effect.

chosen to be linearly polarized at an angle of 45° with respect to the static
magnetic field. The transmitted wave does not experience a rotation; it
becomes elliptically polarized, however. The phase angle or the amount of

Density-Matrix Formulation
of Optical Susceptibility
The density-matrix theory plays an important role in applications to linear
and nonlinear optical properties of materials in quantum electronics. The
basic idea is that the density-matrix formulation provides a most convenient
method to predict the expectation values of physical quantities when the
exact wave function is unknown.
1.1
DENSITY-MATRIX THEORY [1, 2]
Assume that ljJ(r, t) is the wave function of the material system under a
perturbation Hamiltonian, which can be due to an electromagnetic field or
other excitations. The density-matrix operator p is defined as the ensemble
average of the form
(1.1)
where an overbar means the ensemble average. Explicitly, we can expand the
wave function ljJ(T, t) using a complete set of wave functions ¢Jr):

Though not required, {¢n(r)} are usually chosen to be the solutions of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian H 0' which describes the electronic states of the
material system in the absence of any perturbation. The ensemble average of
a physical quantity P is given by

DENSITY-MATRIX APPROACH TO THE OPTICAL PROCESSES

An advantage of the density-matrix approach is that it gives general expres-
sions for the linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities [2]. This approach
has been shown to be very useful to study quantum electronic processes in
different material systems. The density operator P satisfies the equation of
motion as derived in (1.9):
where the Hamiltonian operator consists of three parts:
H = H o + H' + Hrandom

(1.11)
H o is the unperturbed Hamiltonian, H' accounts for the interaction such as
the electron-photon interaction, -ror which

We find that the relation
(1.42)
is observed. This can also be checked with the symmetry property of the
complex permittivity function
E'(W) + iE"(w), discussed in Eqs. (E.8) and
(E.9) in Appendix E, in which the real part c'ew) is an even function and the
imaginary part E"(W) is an odd function of w.
When a distribution of states is considered, for example, the energy bands
(1.43a)
and
(1.439)
for two sets of wave vectors k , and k b . We have to sum over the density of
states in the k space. Assume that E b > E; and h co is close to E; - Ea' The
second term in EOXi/W) will be the resonant contribution:
"
The spins sa and
Sb are considered. If the states \a) and Ib) db not include
the mixing of spins, one finds that the spin summation gives simply a factor of
2 since the dipole operator M is independent of spin and
.
(1.45)
that is, the spins s., and
S b must be the same. Thus; the spin selection rule

gives a factor of 2 when summing over spins.
(1.46)
For a plane wave propagating in an anisotropic medium with
(1.47)
where (Eb)ij is the background dielectric tensor, the solutions are in the 'form
of ordinary and extraordinary waves with corresponding propagation con-
stants.
Let us consider the simple case when (Eb)ij and Xu are diagonal:
(1.48)
That is, the induced polarization has the same direction as the applied
electric field direction, i = i:

(1.52)
where tiYi« = f /2 is the half linewidth. We see that the expression for cz in
(1.52) is the same as (9.1.38) if the conversion (9.1.31) is used. The expression
for
