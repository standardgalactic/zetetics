College of Arts and Science, Division of Health Professions Mission Statement 
The CAS Division of health professions is firmly committed to fulfilling the mission of 
Andrews University through the didactic and clinical training of health professionals. The 
health profession departments provide multi-level educational programs for diverse groups of 
students. Each is accredited by the appropriate professional accrediting association or adheres 
to their accrediting association standards. The health profession faculty provides high quality 
education, research, and service within a Christ centered environment that fosters 
collaboration and mutual respect. Graduates of these programs serve Christ by ministering to 
the needs of others through the delivery of effective contemporary healthcare. 
2.    The Speech-Language Pathology & Audiology Department Mission Statement 
The Department of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology at Andrews University 
provides faith-affirming Christian education focusing on the knowledge and practice of 
speech-language pathology and audiology. Majors are expected to become knowledgeable 
about a variety of communication disorders, their etiology, and treatment; develop 
professional oral and written language and demeanor; treat all patients with respect regardless 
of age, gender, or ethnicity; provide effective clinical services; and successfully prepare for 
graduate education and service to the world.  
3.    Relationship to the University’s Mission 
The Department of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology at Andrews University 
contributes to the university‘s overall mission by a) instructing students in sound and current 
theoretical approaches in their areas of study, b) facilitating and guiding the practical training 
that develops the relevant competencies, c) encouraging students to develop their own 
techniques to therapy based on the dual considerations of i) applicable theoretical knowledge 

3 
 
and ii) the individualized needs of the client, and d) providing a context of on-going research 
that stimulates students‘ inquisitiveness, sharpens their analytical powers, and demonstrates 
the effectiveness of appropriate strategies through outcomes that satisfy clients, family 
members, as well as other professionals. Students are also encouraged to explore the arts, 
letters and sciences within the context of a Christian worldview, and to respect ethnic and 
cultural diversity.  
B. Pertinent History  
Departmental History 
The Speech Department, which later became the Communication Department, was established 
at Andrews University in 1956. Beginning in 1969, a concentration in speech therapy was 
added, allowing students to complete course work preparing them for entrance into a Master‘s 
program in Speech Pathology or Audiology.   In 1980, Communication Disorders became a 
department separate from the Communication Department.  In 1988, the name of the 
department was changed to Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology to more effectively 
convey the nature of the Department. 
Clinic History 
The operation of a speech and hearing clinic was begun in 1972. The clinic was established in 
order to provide speech and hearing services to the community and clinical practicum 
opportunities for students.  The speech and hearing clinic was originally staffed by faculty 
members who were responsible for teaching academic content as well as the clinical 
supervision of students.  As a result, faculty members worked under significant overload.  For 
example, during the early ‗80s the audiologist‘s caseload was almost equal to a full-time 

4 
 
audiologist with no teaching or supervision responsibilities.  In September 1989, the clinic 
was granted Professional Service Board (PSB) accreditation.  PSB represents ASHA‘s official 
recognition that a clinical program meets professional standards of quality and is capable of 
providing the best possible service to the public. At that time the clinic received high 
commendations from the Board for several reasons, including: 
 excellent qualifications and dedication of the staff 
 stimulating professional environment 
 superior supervisor-student protocols far in excess of minimum standards 
 good array of equipment available in the clinic 
In May 1990, the university clinic became affiliated with the Lakeland Regional Health 
System, Inc. A new facility was built and equipped at 9045-3 U.S. 31 in Berrien Springs on 
the edge of campus.  The facility, which became known as Lakeland Speech and Hearing 
Center provided a clinical site where students could both do observations and participate in 
clinical practica.  The affiliation agreement required that both the business previously 
conducted at the AU clinic and the recently obtained (PSB) affiliation status be turned over to 
the Lakeland cooperation.  According to the terms of the agreement, in exchange the new 
clinical facility would be available to students and faculty to meet their clinical needs.  This 
arrangement worked well and lasted for the next nine years, but was abruptly terminated in 
1998 or 1999.  As a result the Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology department lost a 
fully-equipped clinic, its business clientele and its PSP accreditation.  So far, a suitable or 
comparable space for providing students with clinical experiences has not been obtained by 
the department.

C. Benchmarking 
What is the demand for the SPLAD program within the Adventist community--
Regionally, Nationally and Globally? 
National Demand 
Note: Speech-language Pathology and Audiology are dual professions that converge at the 
undergraduate level and separate at the graduate level.  The recommended term for referring 
to both disciplines is: Communication Sciences & Disorders (CSD) while the professions 
are labeled as (a) Speech-Language Pathology, and (b) Audiology.  The AU SPLAD 
department has decided to retain the longer nomenclature so as to distinguish itself from the 
Communications Department. 
           The demand for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and audiologists (AUDs) in the 
workforce continues to be high across the United States. According to the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS), employment opportunities are expected to be ―excellent‖, for speech-
language pathologists, and ―favorable‖ for audiologists throughout the next decade. 
Nationally, the employment rate of both speech-language pathologists and audiologists is 
expected to demonstrate growth of about 10% between the years 2006 and 2016.  These 
predictions translate into about 12,000 new jobs for SLPS and 1,200 new jobs for audiologists 
over a 10-year span.  
          Increases in the demand for these services will be fuelled by an aging ‗baby boom‘ 
generation who may be prone to suffer from neurological diseases strongly associated with 
speech, language, hearing, and swallowing impairments. Advances in medicine which 
increase the survival rate of premature infants, and trauma and stroke victims, will also drive 
growth in demand for SLP and audiology services. 

6 
 
         The demand for services in educational settings is also expected to increase based on (a) 
projected growth in the numbers of special education students in public school settings; and 
(b) federal laws which mandate services to all children with speech, language and hearing 
problems enrolled in public education.

Excerpted from: Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 
 
Data obtained from national surveys done by ASHA and the U.S. Office of Special Education 
indicate that the number of job openings for SLPs currently exceed the number of job seekers 
by 47 % in medical settings and 72% in school settings (ASHA Work Conditions Trends, 
2009). Findings also indicated that whereas, job openings  varied by geographical and 
employment settings in health care settings, the demand for SLPs exceeded supply in school 
settings  regardless of type of employment facility. Both ASHA and BLS data document a 
critical need for bilingual (Spanish-speaking) speech-language pathologists nationwide. 
State-wide Demand 
The State of Michigan is also experiencing a current shortage of SLPs—especially in 
educational settings.  In 2007, a taskforce was set up at the request of the State of Michigan‘s 
Department of Education to investigate solutions for addressing persistent vacancies occurring 
in school districts across the state. The group, which became known as the Michigan 

7 
 
Communication Disorders Personnel Advisory Group, was comprised of the chairs of all 
university programs based in Michigan (including Andrews University) along with 
representatives from medical and educational settings.  The purposes of the advisory group 
included: (a) gathering data on supply and demand for SLPs in the state of Michigan; (b) 
partnering with colleges and universities to develop a plan to meet documented shortages; and 
(c) developing recruitment and retention plans for school SLPs and audiologists. 
              In an attempt to obtain verifiable data regarding the perceived shortage, the advisory 
group conducted a survey of Michigan Special Education Administrators (MAASE).  Results 
indicated that 100% of respondents anticipated SLP hiring needs over the next 5 years and 
projected a total of 273.6 additional positions within a similar time frame. The figure was 
estimated based on a number of factors, including increased student identification, 
replacement of retiring staff and replacement of staff that leave for other positions.  The table 
below summarizes the estimated number of vacancies over the next five years:

Michigan CD Advisory Group Report, 2008 
 
The Advisory group also ascertained that current speech-language pathology and audiology 
programs in the state of Michigan were not producing sufficient graduates to meet in-state 
needs, and that given the national demand for the professions, graduates were seeking more 
competitive out-of-state jobs.   

8 
 
              Among the solutions proposed by the group was the need to increase the number of 
students admitted to graduate programs in the state of Michigan.  As of Fall 2009, all of the 
five graduate programs increased the number of students admitted to their programs by 5, to a 
possible increase of 25 graduate students across programs—but a woefully inadequate attempt 
to fill the need.  Other recruitment strategies proposed by the group included: (a) creating 
incentives for retirees to return to work; (b) financing the cost of certification reinstatement; 
(c) lobbying for loan forgiveness programs in the state of Michigan; and (d) increasing and 
improving recruitment strategies at the high school level. 
 
Local Demand--Berrien County 
Anecdotal evidence in support of local shortages also exists.  The current chair of the 
Andrews University program receives emails and telephone calls on an almost daily basis 
regarding vacancies (medical & school) in Berrien County.  Recruiters are sometimes willing 
to pay up to $100.00 an hour (as compared to the national average of $45.00) for contract 
positions within a 50-mile radius of Andrews University. The department has also been 
approached by several local Special Education directors and local Nursing home directors 
regarding their willingness to partner with Andrews in providing employment should our 
program produce graduate students.  Over the past 12 months, the Provost‘s office has 
received several letters encouraging Andrews to consider a Master‘s program in Speech-
Language Pathology.  What follows is a quote from a letter dated August 27th, 2008 from an 
administrator in the Berrien Springs School System: 
―For many years, it has been extremely difficult to find speech therapists, not only in 
southwestern Michigan, but across the country…  We are not the only local school 
district with this dilemma. There are several Berrien County districts starting school 
without speech therapists. Some have been searching for two or three years‖.  

9 
 
Another area Supervisor of Special Education in her letter to the Provost dated July 9, 2008 
indicated her awareness of the need for speech therapists in her school district: 
―I have spoken with educators in other school districts and discovered that there is 
….a great need for such a program in our area.   I would aggressively promote the 
hiring of qualified graduates from Andrews University‖. 
The demand for these professions (especially school-based speech-language pathology) has 
reached almost crisis proportions, both nationally and locally. [See Appendix 1 for entire text 
of letters and additional Supply and Demand data]. 
 
[Compare this program with competing institutions with respect to (a) institutional 
resources allocated, (b) program expenses (c) student enrollment, and (d) student success.]  
 
The only competing program for speech-language pathology and audiology in the Adventist 
educational system is located at Loma Linda University in California. Loma Linda University 
(LLU) and Andrews University (AU) are the only two Seventh-day Adventist institutions 
(nationally and globally) with CSD programs.  Loma Linda offers an undergraduate program 
in speech-language pathology and audiology and a graduate program in speech-language 
pathology only. Undergraduate students are accepted for their junior and senior years only. 
There are no Seventh-day Adventist institutions that offer a graduate degree in audiology.  
This may be due to the fact that the occupation is relatively small, and requires a significant 
outlay of resources for equipment and technology. The impact of LLU‘s program on 
enrollment trends at Andrews is not clear and has not been documented. 
           Calvin College, a small Christian college about 100 miles northeast of Andrews 
University may also be viewed as a close competitor.  At present they offer an undergraduate-
only degree in speech-language pathology and audiology.  Based on personal communication, 

10 
 
Calvin College will initiate a graduate program in speech-language pathology in the Fall of 
2010.   
             In terms or public university programs, there are at present five universities in 
Michigan that offer graduate programs in CSD.  These are: (a) Western Michigan University 
(WMU), (b) Michigan State University (MSU), (c) Eastern Michigan University (EMU),  
(d) Wayne State University (WSU), and (e) Central Michigan University (CMU).  Like 
Andrews University, Northern Michigan University has an undergraduate-only program.  
MSU has recently voted to close their undergraduate program (as of the 2010-2011 school 
year), but retain their graduate program.  Thus far, Western Michigan University is our closest 
competitor offering both undergraduate and graduate programs in speech-language pathology. 
Other competitors may include St. Mary‘s College in South Bend, IN which started an 
undergraduate-only program about 5 years ago. Also, very recently (11/03/ 09),  Grand Valley 
State University  posted a vacancy on their website for an Associate Professor/ Coordinator of 
Speech-Language Pathology Emphasis for a  new undergraduate Communication Disorders 
program scheduled to begin in the Fall of 2010.  Because Andrews serves a very distinct 
clientele, the proliferation of programs in Michigan/Indiana is not viewed so much as a threat, 
but rather as evidence of the demand for the program. 
          Given the geographical distance between Loma Linda University and Andrews 
University, it may be assumed that as Seventh-day Adventist institutions, each may be 
attracting a different group of students based on geographic proximity to their home states. 
However, the possibility also exists that some SDA students may choose Loma Linda 
University over Andrews University with the hope of remaining at the same university for the 
master‘s program. Many AU graduates have taken advantage of the proximity of WMU for 

11 
 
pursuing their graduate studies so that they may maintain contact with the social/spiritual 
atmosphere at Andrews University. 
           Please find below Benchmarking data for two private, parochial undergraduate-only 
programs: Calvin College and Augustana College.  The latter founded in 1860, is affiliated 
with the Evangelical Lutheran Church and has a reputation for offering one of the most 
rigorous undergraduate programs nationally.  Analysis of benchmarking data indicate that 
although Augustana College‘s total number of majors is less than that of Andrews, the total 
number of faculty in the department exceeds Andrews‘ numbers by 200%.   Also, whereas 
student enrollment at Calvin College is about 28% higher than at Andrews, Calvin‘s total 
number of faculty exceeds that of Andrews by 200%.  The three programs are similar in the 
number of credits offered. See Table 3.

D. Internal Impact 
[How does the program contribute to the Success of Andrews University?] 
 
        A clear majority of the courses offered by the Speech-Language Pathology and 
Audiology Department are geared to students in the major.  There is only one service course, 
SPPA 435-Commuication Development & Disorders for Classroom Teachers that fulfills 
requirements for students in various majors in the School of Education.  Two other courses 
required for SPLAD majors, SPPA 234 Introduction to Speech-Language Pathology & 
Audiology and SPPA321 Normal Language Development, are included in the list of required 
courses for Language Arts majors in the School of Education. Occasionally, other students in 
the English Department and the Seminary have elected to take other courses offered as Topics 
courses, such as Accent Modification or Central Auditory Processing Disorders. The 
department does not offer any courses that fulfill GE requirements.   
 
[How does the program contribute to the success of programs in other departments?] 
 
            Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology are by nature cross disciplinary 
professions—incorporating the fields of medicine, linguistics, sociology and education. This 
department does not only enjoy a close relationship with the School of Education from a 
spatial standpoint (we are housed in their building), but engage in several interdisciplinary 
academic endeavors.  Our faculty regularly lecture in several Educational Psychology classes.

The department chair is currently on four dissertation committees housed in the School of 
Education.  We also collaborate with the English department in terms of class offerings for 
second-language learners. 
Criterion 2: PROGRAM QUALITY (Inputs) 
[What difference are you making through your program? And how can you validate your 
program’s impact? Provide documentation for program inputs and outputs.  Document the 
quality of program inputs and processes. In what ways can you document that learning is taking 
place in your department?] 
 
 A. Human Resources 
[How many faculty, staff and student workers are assigned to the program? What are the 
degrees\qualifications of the faculty to teach in the discipline (how many have discipline 
appropriate/ terminal degrees)? What percentage of instruction is offered by full-time faculty?]  
         Faculty. The department has three full-time faculty members all of whom are certified 
by the American Speech-Language-Hearing-Association (ASHA).  Two faculty members are 
certified in speech-language pathology and one is certified in audiology.  The audiologist is 
also licensed to work in the State of Michigan.  Michigan is currently in the process of 
instituting a licensure requirement for speech-language pathologists. Two of the three faculty 
members hold the entry-level qualifications for clinical practice in their areas—the master‘s 
degree in speech-language pathology and the Doctor of Audiology degree. These degrees are 
the minimum entry-level qualifications for professional practice and are appropriate for an 
undergraduate-only program.  A third faculty member holds two terminal research doctorates 
(Ed.D., Ph.D) in the areas of Special Education and Speech-Language Pathology, 
respectively. Table 4 below summarizes faculty rank and qualifications. (See Appendix 2 for 
complete faculty CVs).

Staff. This department has operated with minimal administrative support for almost two 
decades. For most of the period under review, a budget for a staff position was not available to 
the department.  After nearly 20 years of minimal staff support, half time contract funding for 
an administrative assistant was made available for the 2009-2010 school year. During the 
2008-2009 school year, four student workers were employed as readers and office assistants, 
including a half-time Graduate Assistant funded by the Graduate division of the College of 
Arts and Sciences.  In addition two undergraduate research assistants were employed and 
funded by a faculty research grant and an external research grant, respectively.  This year, in 
addition to the half-time student worker, a half-time graduate assistant and three student 
workers are also employed.   
B. Physical Resources 
[What are equipment, facilities, and other resources used by the program?] 
           Audiological Equipment. The profession (and pedagogy) of audiology relies heavily on 
technological equipment.  Generally, the equipment presently available to the department is 
sufficient for meeting basic teaching needs.  An audiology booth and sound-isolated chamber is 
housed within the limited space allocated to the department in Bell Hall, and accounts for about 
20% of the available departmental space in terms of square footage.  

15 
 
Available audiological equipment includes a fully computerized MED Rx Avant 
audiometer, one portable Beltone audiometer, a GSI 33 Middle Ear Analyzer, and an 
Acoustic Impedance Microprocessor. This equipment is used for both teaching and clinical 
purposes and is sufficient to meet the needs of a maximum class size of about 10.  Recent 
enrollment increases that more than doubled the number of students in the department, 
showcased the need for increased booth space and more portable diagnostic equipment for 
student practice and training.  The MED Rx audiometer was obtained from funding received 
about four years ago from Physics Enterprises, and represents cutting edge state-of the-art 
technology.  The GSI Middle Ear Analyzer (Tympanometer) was obtained at the beginning of 
the 2009-2010 school year and replaced a machine that was more than 20 years old.  The 
equipment is maintained in good repair and is serviced and calibrated annually through a 
Gordon Stowe contract.  Although the majority of the equipment is current and up-to-date, 
there is very limited available space for housing the equipment and both students and clients 
are forced to stand in   the hall way and/or take turns in the booth during most diagnostic 
teaching procedures.   
                Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Supplies.  Since 2006, the department has been 
the recipient of an ongoing clinical materials grant—also referred to as the University 
Partnership Program-UPP—from one of the largest suppliers of therapeutic materials, Super 
Duper Publications.  The value of the materials received thus far is close to $30,000.00.   In 
addition to therapy materials, UPP also supplies or significantly discounts all the cognitive, 
linguistic and psychological tests published by the company.  The UPP relationship with Super 
Duper was made possible by a grant request developed by Dr. Lena Caesar. Therapy materials 
at this time are adequate to departmental needs, however, accessibility to the materials caused 

16 
 
by very limited space for storage, and the absence of a designated therapy area, limits students‘ 
access to the materials, and clients‘ access to the benefits.  
         Other Equipment and Supplies.  Equipment for audio and video recording is necessary 
both for training student clinicians and providing client services.  These include 4 digital voice 
recorders and 2 video cameras.  The recording equipment was initially obtained for gathering 
data for a clinical research grant obtained from ASHA during the 2008-2009 school year.  The 
grant allows for all equipment to remain in the PI‘s department at the end of data collection. 
         Office and Pedagogical Equipment.  The SPLAD department owns very limited 
audiovisual equipment.  There is one laptop with PowerPoint and content-based interactive 
software (in the areas of Anatomy, Speech science, Voice, Phonetics) available to all three 
faculty members.  There is one portable projector that is almost 10 years old, and a mobile TV 
cart with DVD/VCR.  The department houses two printers: one color, one black and white.  
There is no student computer lab or work area.  Students are forced to peruse confidential 
therapy reports and materials as they stand or sit in the narrow departmental hallways or crouch 
in corners. 
           Faculty Computers.   Each faculty member presently has a personal computer that is less 
than 5 years old, and equipped with basic software packages (Microsoft Office Pro Suite 2003, 
Outlook, Gradekeeper and Banner).  Only one computer has the SPSS statistical software 
package.  (Please see Appendix 4 for a detailed listing of equipment, tests and clinical 
supplies).

C. Curriculum 
[Describe your program’s curriculum. What is the scope of the program (its breadth and

           The major in speech-language pathology and audiology at Andrews University offers 
pre-professional (undergraduate) education for those interested in becoming speech-language 
pathologists or audiologists. The undergraduate curriculum not only provides students with 
the prerequisite coursework for graduate school admission, but also with opportunities for 
clinical experience in the department and community. (See Appendix 3 for full course 
descriptions).  
         Individuals desiring to become speech-language pathologists must obtain a master's 
degree. Individuals desiring to become audiologists must obtain a clinical doctorate (AuD). 
Students entering the program with a minimum of 25 credits are required to have a cumulative 
GPA of 2.75 or above. Only two courses, SPPA234 and SPPA270, are open to all students 
regardless of major or GPA. A cumulative 3.0 GPA is required before entering all upper 
division courses. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required for students transferring into 
the program during their junior year. The major is designed so that it may be completed 
during a student's junior and senior years. The BS degree in this major requires 46 credits; the 
minor consists of 22 credits. 
            The Undergraduate Core Requirements for the major conform to pre-professional 
guidelines established by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). 
According to ASHA, students are expected to have completed a set of courses at the 
undergraduate level that provide substantial academic foundations for the study of SLP, to 
include foundations in: (a) the basic sciences and mathematics; (b) social/behavioral 
sciences, (c) communication sciences; and (c) communication disorders. (See Table below).

ASHA has also designated nine competency areas that students are required to master prior to 
obtaining professional certification. KASA refers to Knowledge and Skills Acquisition, a 
complex set of nine knowledge areas designed to ensure that students achieve a 
comprehensive set of critical knowledge-based and skill-based competencies that are needed 
in order to earn the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology (CCC-
SLP) from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) at the end of their 
graduate education.  The undergraduate program at Andrews University addresses at least 8 of 
these 9 skill areas in addition to fulfilling ASHA‘s requirements for undergraduate 
coursework.  These nine competency areas are as follows: (a)Articulation; (b) Cognitive

D. Technology  
[How adaptable is the program to the advancements in technology? Can 
restructuring and\or technological innovations be implemented that will more 
effectively utilize educational best practice and the newest information technology 
while containing costs?  What is the relationship of the program to emerging trends 
in distance and asynchronous learning?]    
 
 
The SPLAD program is extremely adaptive to advancements in technology—given that the 
professions themselves (especially audiology) are technologically-based.  In terms of 
pedagogy, innovative didactic approaches that often utilize technology include: 
 Technology-enhanced lectures (Power-Point, web-based interaction, CD-ROM 
Simulations, etc) 
 Problem-based Learning 
 Field trips and Hands-on Learning experiences 
 Group/Cooperative Learning Opportunities 
 Independent research projects 
          At present, the department does not have any online offerings. Although the nature of 
the profession may not support widespread distance learning, faculty are pursuing the 
possibility of offering SPPA 234-Introduction to Speech Pathology and Audiology in an on-
line format.  Loma Linda University currently offers  a similar course in a distance learning 
format. Pre-speech-language pathology students at Southern Adventist University are required 
to take the course that Loma Linda offers.  

21 
 
         The department has recently begun to take steps toward becoming ―paperless‖.  As of 
the Fall 2009 semester, all clinical forms have been uploaded to the department‘s website and 
are accessible to students as PDF documents. 
E. Enrollment Trends 
[What have been the program enrollments for the past five years? What are the enrollments 
in courses required for other programs?] 
 
 
        Enrollment numbers in the department indicate a definite upward trend. This department 
has seen considerable fluctuations in enrollment since its inception in 1987 when there were 
only three majors. Over the past 10-year span (1998-2008), enrollment has again fluctuated, 
but has generally remained in the 30s—with the exception of the 2002-2003 and the 2003-
2004 school years when the numbers hovered in the low 20s. Since 2004, enrollment has not 
dipped below 30 and has shown a steady upward trend.  Enrollment numbers for the  2008-
2009 school year stood at a record-breaking 58—the highest number of students ever enrolled 
in the department.  Since the 2003-2004 school year, when the numbers of majors stood at 26, 
the enrollment has grown by more than a 120%.   See the following bar graphs  for 2005-
2008 enrollment numbers.

F. Productivity 
[What are the numbers of credit hours generated, degrees or certificates awarded, services 
rendered, research developed, creative efforts produced, attendance at performances?]  
 
        As indicated below, departmental productivity in terms of credit hours generated  
reveal a steady upward trend—except for a sharp decline in the 2006-2007 school year when 
freshmen comprised the majority of incoming majors. Freshmen only take one 3-credit class 
in the major during their first year.  Transfer students generally comprise the majority of in-
coming majors and may take as many as 21 credits during the junior year.  The low numbers 
of graduates 2004 and 2007 may represent the end of an era of low enrollment.  All current 
classes in the department boast of double digit numbers.   In terms of graduate school 
acceptance rates, please note that not all graduates apply to graduate school immediately after 
graduation—many find related jobs.

Criterion 2: PROGRAM QUALITY (Outputs) 
A. Student Retention 
[How well are students retained? What is your program’s graduation rate?] 
 
        Almost all SPLAD majors (90%) who begin the program as freshmen, graduate at the 
end of four years—with the exception of those who are also Spanish majors and are required 
to spend an extra year abroad.  The retention rate of transfer juniors is also close to 100%--
given that the program is selective and transfer students are required to have a 3.0 GPA prior 
to enrolling in junior-level courses. Students transferring into the major as Sophomores (with 
entering GPAs of less than 3.0) have the lowest retention rates (79%).  
B. Program Quality 
[What results demonstrate the quality of the program? Is there external validation of 
quality? What examples of exemplary performance does the program demonstrate?] 
Academic Quality 
        Teaching quality is also very good in the department. All faculty rate above average on  
student course evaluations, as compared with university faculty and national norms. One   
faculty member, was selected as the 2007-2008 teacher of the year by the Andrews University 
student body (AUSB), and faculty members have been repeatedly nominated to Who‘s Who 
Among American Teachers. All faculty utilize innovative approaches in their teaching and 
continue to research and experiment with new approaches to encourage and enhance student 
learning. Faculty is also committed to incorporating faith and learning and all faculty have 
worship and/or prayer before classes. Most classes allow time for students to share prayer 
requests and blessings and individual prayer is frequently held with students in faculty offices. 
(See Appendix 6 for Student/Alumni Testimonials of Program Quality). 

25 
 
         Many graduate schools (Central Mission University, The Ohio State University, Howard 
University, Penn State University, etc) have specifically commended our program on the 
quality and preparedness of our graduates. (See Appendix 7 for evidence of external 
validation).  But perhaps the success of our students in terms of Graduate school acceptance 
has been the greatest measure of our academic respectability. A clear majority of students (80-
100%) who choose to apply to graduate school are accepted. Consistently, our students gain 
admission to graduate programs ranked among the top 10 in the nation.  Some of these 
programs include: Northwestern University (#1), University of Wisconsin-Madison (#2), and 
Purdue University (#3).  Other prestigious institutions where our graduates are presently 
enrolled include: The George Washington University, James Madison University, Galludet 
University, and Loma Linda University—to name a few. The program‘s effectiveness is 
therefore demonstrated by the quality of students it prepares for further professional training 
and meaningful service contributions.  
Clinic Quality 
         The Andrews University Central Auditory Processing (CAPD) service is an important 
part of the Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology program.  Students in the major spend 
at least one semester in clinical practicum for both speech and hearing disorders. The hearing 
clinic, located in the SPLAD department and directed by Dr. Darah Regal, includes a sound 
proof booth and is equipped for full evaluations of hearing ability and middle ear function.  
Besides pure tone testing, the hearing clinic also offers specialized testing in Central Auditory 
Processing Disorders (CAPD), for which it draws clients from across Michiana.  This is the 
only service of its kind within a 100-mile radius.  During the 2008-2009 school year, the 
hearing clinic provided services to about 70 clients, and currently has a waiting list of about 

26 
 
30 individuals for the current school year. There has also been an increase in the range and 
variety of referral sources, including pediatricians, school psychologists & ENTs—a clear 
indication of the growing reputation of the AU Speech and Hearing Clinic.  (See Appendix 5 
for Client Testimonials of Program Quality). 
Research Quality: 
        Faculty has made more than 25 professional presentations over a 5-year time span.  Also 
more than half a dozen scholarly papers have been published in peer-review journals. The 
department has also collaborated with other universities for research and clinical training 
purposes.  The following report was first published on the Western Michigan University 
College of Health and Human Services website: 
 Students from the Speech-Language Pathology & Audiology Departments (SPLAD) of 
Andrews University and Western Michigan University (WMU) participated in a collaborative 
clinical research study led by Andrews University SPLAD professor, Dr. Lena Caesar.  WMU 
professor, Dr. Nickola Nelson, a nationally-acclaimed researcher in the field of language and 
literacy acquisition, served as technical consultant and co-investigator.  The study, entitled  
―Supporting the Acquisition of  Language and Literacy through School-Home Activities‖ 
(SALSA), was designed to examine the effectiveness of a home-school partnership for 
stimulating language and literacy skills in Spanish-speaking children of migrant farmers.  The 8-
week research study conducted at a Migrant Head Start Center in southwest Michigan focused 
on expanding children‘s abilities to produce oral narratives based on drawings of home 
experiences provided by parents.  More than 30 families participated in the SALSA activities.  
Findings of the study will be presented at the National Convention of Speech-Language 
Pathologists that meets in New Orleans later this year. 
C. Student Outcomes 
[What are tests scores on nationally standardized instruments that measure attainment? 
How have the graduates fared on the GRE, the LSAT, the MCAT, and other standardized 
tests? How successful are program graduates in seeking graduate and professional 
admission? In the case of performance- music, drama, art- what evidence is there of 
achievement outcome? What is the track record of the graduates on state professional 
licensure and certification examination?] 
 
         As an undergraduate department, majors are not required to take any of the standardized 
tests indicated above.  Success of the program is measured by the percentage of graduate 

27 
 
school admissions from students who apply.  Data from the Assessment office in the form of 
Senior Exit Test scores do provide some comparative data for student performance by majors 
and schools.  This information indicated that SPLAD students‘ performance was slightly 
below the 50th percentile for the 2008-2009 testing.  See Appendix 8 for entire report. 
The following tables summarize students‘ goals and outcomes for the 2005-2008 period

D. Student, Alumni and Employer Satisfaction 
          Student Satisfaction. Student perceptions of overall program quality and academics 
were measured using the Senior Exit Survey sent out to graduating majors during the last 
semester of their Senior year. The tables that follow (Tables 8 & 9) demonstrate that 
graduating students‘ perceptions of academic and program quality were generally in the 
‗above average‘ to ‗excellent‘ range.   Spring 2008 was the first year that a departmental 
Senior Exit survey was used for measuring student satisfaction.

         Alumni Satisfaction.   Alumni perceptions of overall program quality and academics 
were measured using an Alumni Survey sent out to SPLAD alumni via an online survey in 
2008.  Twenty three alumni responded.  The tables that follow (Tables 10 & 11) demonstrate 
that SPLAD department alumni were generally very satisfied with program quality and  rated 
the quality of most areas in the ‗above average‘  range.   Spring 2008 was the only year that a 
departmental  survey was used for measuring alumni satisfaction. The department intends to 
gather alumni data on a biennial basis.

E. Program Philosophy 
[Does the program successfully provide for the intellectual, social and spiritual 
development of students?] 
 
         Professionals working in the areas of speech-language pathology and audiology have 
unique opportunities to work with individuals with impairments of communication.  The 
SPLAD department prepares students academically and clinically to provide services to those 
with communication disorders.  As part of the academic component, research activities are 
encouraged early in the program for students who show potential in this area.  All students are 
involved in clinical practicum courses, conducting therapy and assisting in speech, language 
and hearing evaluations.  As part of the commitment to service, students are also encouraged 
to be involved in speech and hearing screenings conducted in the community to identify 
individuals who need further evaluation.  Our students are therefore prepared, academically 
and clinically, for graduate education while they learn about the needs of others through 
involvement in service. Specific activities available to students to foster development in 
social, spiritual and intellectual areas are as follows: 
--Social Development: (a) Speech and Hearing Club; (b) Social events, such as the yearly 
welcome-back party by the lake; and (c) professional outings to state and national 
professional meetings and conferences. 
 --Spiritual Development:  (a) Vespers are held regularly at faculty members‘ homes and 
students are strongly encouraged to participate in week-end worship experiences. A weekly 
of prayer & praise is reserved in many of the SPLAD classes.  All classes/social events/ 
assemblies begin with prayer and a short devotional. Students are encouraged to share their 
prayer requests and petitions in both corporate and individualized sharing opportunities. 
Department-wide worships along with social activities are held every month in respective 

35 
 
faculty homes. Intentional, transparent integration of faith and learning is also fostered and 
encouraged. 
--Intellectual Development: Departmental offerings are rigorous and thought-provoking.  
Students are provided with several opportunities to attend research and professional 
conferences.  Students also have the opportunity to participate in research studies and 
present at local and national conferences.  
F. Evidence of Faculty Growth and Reputation 
[How well do program faculty achieve in measures of teaching effectiveness and 
professional development? What is the track record of the program faculty in producing 
research accepted in peer-reviewed publications or for juried presentation? What 
recognition does faculty bring to program in the areas of community, denominational and 
professional service?] 
 
         The tables below summarize faculty involvement in terms of teaching, research and 
service. Teaching skills are evaluated through Student Course Evaluations, and Department 
Chair Evaluations. Peer Evaluations are being implemented for the current school year.  All 
faculty members score at or above university means on their course evaluations and on 
student and alumni ratings of faculty expertise and teaching.  The tables below (12, 13, 14) 
summarize faculty activities in terms of teaching, research, and service.

Criterion 3: Finances 
A. Departmental Revenue 
Does the revenue from tuition, fees and other sources of income such as entrepreneurial 
activities associated with department offering the degree, cover the direct costs of program 
as well as an appropriate contribution to institutional overhead?  
 
        Yes.  Between the 2005-2006 and the 2008-2009 school years, revenue generated by the 
department has been sufficient to cover the direct costs of the department as well as contribute 
to institutional overhead.  The 2006-2007 academic year constitutes an exception to that trend 
when the program operated at 0.98 productivity.   Although the productivity data for the 2008-
2009 academic year appears to have exceeded 2.0, actual productivity may be less when 
adjusted for the 10-month ‘08 fiscal year.   Productivity data were obtained from the Dean‘s 
office of the College of Arts and Sciences. See Table 15 below.

Although data were not available for benchmarking other undergraduate SPLAD programs, 
comparative data from the four other health-related programs at Andrews University indicate 
that SPLAD‘s productivity trends are somewhat below or similar to the majority of the 
programs with the exception of Nutrition and Wellness.   This may be due to several reasons. 
For example, whereas the PT and CLS students receive practical training at off-campus sites 
with ‗adjunct‘ supervisors, faculty in the SPLAD and Nursing departments directly supervise 
their students.  The relatively high productivity of the Nutrition and Wellness department may 
be reflective of their GE coursework offerings in the area of wellness. Table 16 provides a  
4-year comparison of the productivity trends for the five health professions at Andrews 
University.

B. Revenue from External Grants 
 
[What income has the program generated for itself from external grant activity, and what 
does it receive as a result of overhead or indirect cost recovery for the institution?] 
 
In addition to income earned from tuition and fees, the SPLAD department has generated 
monies from the following sources: 
 
 
 

41 
 
 
A.      Grant Amount            Source                  P I                    Duration

B.      Gift/Donations 
 
        $30,000 (approx)        Super Duper Pub.       N/A        2006 - present 
                                          Therapy Supplies                                         (Ongoing) 
C.      Clinic Income 
          $15,000.00 (approx)   Clinic Fees          N/A        2005-2009 
C. Departmental Efficiencies 
 
What demonstrable efficiencies in the way the program is operated (or which could be 
inaugurated) are beneficial to the institution? 
      
        The SPLAD department is the smallest academic department (in terms of faculty & 
operating budget), but operates at comparable efficiency as compared to other health 
professions in CAS (See Table 16 above).  Members of the SPLAD faculty work under very 
extreme circumstances in an attempt to run both a clinical and an academic program with very 
meager faculty and staff support.  The department functioned for several years on a 2-person 
staff—who taught all professional courses, ran a clinic,  and supervised practicum students.  
We are grateful to be functioning with a full complement of 3 faculty members since the Fall 
of 2006.  We are still challenged by the absence of a clinical supervisor for student practica, 
and the unavailability of sufficient support staff to handle the clinical services that we offer to 
the public. Yet our research productivity and reputation for academic rigor are as good or 
better than many other departments with many more resources (CAS productivity report, 
2008). Over the last 5 years, several donations and small grants have been obtained for the 
purchase of clinical materials and tests. These monies, along with the income from clinical 

42 
 
services, reduce the expenditure of departmental funds. We are still challenged by our lack of 
space and the shortage of support staff to handle the clinical services that we offer to the 
public.  However, it is very evident  that in the SPLAD department much is being 
accomplished with very little. 
Criterion 4: A Strategic Analysis of Future Opportunities 
 
[Evaluate future threats to this program in the light of past weaknesses, including past 
inefficiencies, failures to innovate and less than effective service to the students involved. 
Considering the strengths of the program, frankly evaluate opportunities for growth in 
effectiveness, new directions in service, likely financial performance, new impact on students 
involved, resources necessary to achieve new levels of effectiveness, etc]. 
 
Focus on the future opportunities of this program. Briefly summarize the strengths and 
weaknesses already covered, including: 
A. Academic Successes and Challenges 
            The academic strengths (and weaknesses) of the SPLAD department are 
categorized and discussed according to the following three areas: (a) Faculty,  
(b) Curriculum, and (c) Academic-Service Relationship. The following discussion also 
addresses the program‘s effectiveness in preparing graduates for meaningful service: 
a. Faculty.  The experience, expertise, and renown of the department‘s three faculty 
members represent a definite strength.  All faculty members are fully certified by the 
American-Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), and represent a combined 
total of over 50 years of experience and employment in both educational and health 
settings. All faculty are intentional about developing their teaching and clinical expertise 
through a variety of means, including doctoral education, professional conferences, 
professional presentations, publications and  research. Within the last 5 years, the 
department has moved from having no faculty with terminal doctoral degrees, to now 
having 3 doctoral degrees among the 3 faculty.  During the period under review, faculty-

43 
 
authored, peer-reviewed and professional publications have appeared in several highly-
ranked academic journals and the number of professional presentations at State and 
National conferences have exceeded 25.   In 2008, one faculty member was one of three 
individuals nationally to be awarded an external research grant by ASHA; one faculty 
member was also asked to serve as expert reviewer for a $1.2 million grant competition 
from the Alberta Medical Foundation in Canada. The Audiologist receives constant 
requests for her expert opinion and diagnostic competence from school districts, and ENT 
offices all across Michiana.  
b. Diversity. The  reality of both faculty and student diversity may also be viewed as a 
strength. Whereas Andrews University is less than 50% diverse, the percentage of 
students from minority backgrounds in this department ranges from 65 – 85% in any 
given year.  Nationally, the profession of speech-language pathology indicates a 
desperate shortage of minority professionals, with minorities accounting for only about 
5% of the professional core nationwide. Faculty backgrounds are also reflective of rich 
diversity:  One is of Caucasian American descent, one of Caucasian Icelandic descent 
and one of Afro-Caribbean descent.  Whereas the diversity of the faculty in terms of 
cultural background may be viewed as a strength, gender diversity is a definite area of 
weakness.  Although male professors were consistently on faculty during the first 
decade of the program‘s existence, the department has not succeeded in recruiting a 
single male faculty member in the last 20 years. The fact that the present faculty 
composition is 100% female may account for the low male enrollment in the 
department and the erroneous assumption that the profession is exclusively female.   

44 
 
Overall, faculty has maintained high academic standards by providing excellent teaching and 
ready availability to students, despite the space and staff constraints under which they 
operate. Many majors report that they entered the department because of positive student 
reports regarding program quality. 
c. Curriculum.  The B.S. degree in speech-language pathology and audiology at Andrews 
University provides a solid background for careers in audiology, speech-language 
pathology, speech science, hearing science, health care, and special education. The 
curriculum provides students with coursework and experiences above and beyond the 
typical offerings of other undergraduate programs.  For example, Andrews University 
may be the only undergraduate program nationally where students have access to 
cadavers for their Anatomy & Physiology lab work.  The curriculum also offers an 
average of 50% more coursework on specific disorders than other undergraduate 
programs.  In addition, students are required to participate in clinical practicum 
courses, conducting therapy with ‗real‘ patients and assisting in speech, language, and 
hearing evaluations—an opportunity most often reserved for the graduate level.  
Several undergraduate majors have also had the opportunity to participate in faculty 
research and have presented at both state and national professional conferences (See 
Appendix 2, Faculty CV). Alumni of the program have consistently reported that upon 
admission to graduate school, they have felt very prepared and well able to compete 
with peers who completed their undergraduate degrees at other programs.  
d. Strong Academic-Service Relationship. The SPLAD department holds great potential 
for being of service to both the university community and the surrounding society.  
Whereas many larger universities have eliminated clinical practica opportunities at the 

45 
 
undergraduate level, the department‘s clinical practicum requirements are designed to 
engage students in service as early and as adequately as possible. Students‘ 
participation in clinical activities allows them the opportunity to provide speech and 
hearing services to both the university population and the surrounding community.  
Potential clients for in-house services may include individual faculty, staff and 
students in need of hearing testing, along with early identification clinics for students 
enrolled in the Crayon Box, Ruth Murdoch Elementary and Andrews Academy.  The 
local community is well aware of the services that we offer, and a waiting list exists 
for speech/language services and hearing evaluations.  Although there has been 
increased interest in services offered by the Speech and Hearing Clinic in recent years, 
it is possible that the clinic continues to be under-utilized by university personnel.  The 
lack of appropriate clinical space is a definite deterrent to maximizing the services of 
the Clinic. 
B. Effectiveness in Promoting Christian Growth & Denominational Goals 
         A Unique Service to the Church.  The program at Andrews University is one of only two 
SDA programs that offers a bachelor‘s degree in speech-language pathology and audiology.  
The other program, located at Loma Linda University in California, offers both undergraduate 
and graduate training, but only accepts undergraduate students in their junior and senior years. 
In addition, Loma Linda caps both their undergraduate and graduate enrollment at 60 students 
(30 undergrads, 30 grads=15 students per class, per year). Andrews is the only 4-year 
undergraduate program strategically located to offer services to the eastern and Midwestern 
sections of the country.  Enrollment at Andrews University‘s program topped the 50-student 
mark during the 2008-2009 school year. A significant percentage of the majors in the 

46 
 
department transfer from other Adventist colleges—suggesting that many more students are 
interested in this major than Loma Linda could possibly accommodate.  It is clear that the 
demand for this major among Seventh-day Adventist students cannot be met by one 
university.  At present, there is a desperate shortage of SDA  speech-language pathologists 
and audiologists.  Many SDA institutions (academic & healthcare) are experiencing difficulty 
in finding trained SDAs to fill vacant positions. The SPLAD department at Andrews 
University answers to a unique and specific need for attracting and preparing Seventh-day 
Adventists for service to the world church. 
C. Financial Strengths and Weaknesses 
            Clinical services offered by the department have the potential of providing a source 
of financial income. The department has the potential to increase its clinical earnings 
through increased services to the community. However, this would require the hiring of at 
least a half-time clinical supervisor position and a full-time office assistant for billing 
insurance companies and school districts.  Expanding clinical offerings would also require a 
significant expansion of the present clinical space (the issue of space will be further 
discussed in the ‗Threats‘ section which follows). The desperate shortage of trained 
professionals in this area would guarantee sufficient income for offsetting the costs of 
additional personnel. 
             Data on the department‘s fiscal productivity may mask the true extent of the 
constraints under which faculty now work.  Although the department does not generate an 
impressive number of credits (though the credits generated have increased significantly over 
the past five years), the nature of the program, demands one-on-one supervisory time with 
each major—a common feature of many health professions programs, including nursing  (See 

47 
 
Table 16, page 40 for fiscal productivity comparisons). ASHA requires 100% supervision by 
the program faculty for the first 25 clock hours of a student‘s practicum experience.  Each 
student in the SPLAD department is required to have at least 20 hours of supervised practical 
training before graduation.  This limits placement opportunities in settings that are 
inaccessible to faculty. Faculty also invest vast outlays of time in reviewing and editing 
diagnostic reports and language-based therapy plans. The increase in the number of majors 
has therefore resulted in a dramatic increase in the numbers of actual clock hours that faculty 
spend supervising students‘ practicum experiences. 
              Another reason for the relatively low number of credits generated is the fact that this 
department‘s course offerings are directed to SPLAD majors only.  At present, the department 
offers no General Education (GE) courses—as is typical of most highly-specialized 
professional programs.  In the past, the possibility of developing a course with broad appeal 
that could count as fulfilling GE requirements has been discussed.   Possible courses under 
consideration include: (a) SPPA 280 Anatomy and Physiology of Speech and Hearing 
(already in existence)  which is a 4-credit course with a 2-hour lab that may be used to meet 
GE science requirements; (b) A specialized course on ―Communication Strategies for Health 
Professionals‘ which would meet the communication requirement for all five of the health 
professions; and (c) A course in ―American Sign Language‖ which would meet the Foreign 
language requirement for the BA degree.  
D. Potential Departmental Threats 
[Evaluate future threats to this program in the light of past weaknesses, including past 
inefficiencies, failures to innovate and lass than effective service to the students involved]. 
What internal and external environmental factors affect the institution (SPLAD 
department) in such ways that opportunities or threats are created? Which factors must this 
program seize or avoid?]  

48 
 
  
The Andrews University SPLAD department has been in existence for more than 40 
years. Unfortunately, for most of  that  time it has been under continuous threat: threats of 
closure, threats of merger, and threats of being compressed into less and less space. These 
threats have generated fear and anxiety among current and prospective students, as well as 
SPLAD faculty.  The fear of closure may also have been a contributing factor to the 
fluctuations in enrollment evident over the years.  In the late 1990s and early years of this 
decade, several parents and prospective students were heard to voice such concerns as reasons 
for not enrolling in Andrews.  
Lack of space. Prospective students, clients and other visitors often express surprise 
about the very limited space available for student observation and clinical services. Over the 
years a few unsuccessful attempts have been made to resolve the situation. For example,  the 
University‘s involvement (along with Lakeland) in the remodeling of the Medical Specialties 
Building in the 1990s was a heroic attempt to stabilize the department. When the Lakeland 
partnership failed after only a few years and the clinic was closed down, the department‘s 
crisis was further exacerbated by the School of Education repossessing more than one-third of 
the space that the department had occupied for over 30 years.   
The space issue is still unresolved.  In 2008, hopes were raised when the faculty was 
invited to participate in the Buller Hall planning meetings and was included in the first sets of 
blueprints.  In time, the Buller Hall bid was lost and a promise was made by the Provost to 
incorporate our needs into the Nethery Hall renovation plans instead.  As yet, no definite 
commitments have been made with regard to Buller, Nethery, or any other space allocation. 
The historic and present reality of the department‘s ongoing turf war, may suggest that the 

49 
 
most serious threat to the department‘s growth may be as much related to ambivalent and 
sporadic administrative support as to mere limitations in space allocations.   
The following designated spaces are specifically needed: 
 HIPPA-appropriate conference room where confidential patient information can 
be shared and discussed 
 Storage for equipment and instrumentation 
 Work space for students  
 A clinic area with waiting rooms, student observations rooms,  therapy rooms, and 
storage for clinical supplies 
        Salary Scale inequities.  Another serious threat to faculty recruitment and morale is the 
inequity and imbalance reflected in the University‘s newly-implemented salary scale.  The 
new salary scale which was purportedly designed to reflect market trends, appears 
inconsistent in its allocation of rank.   Based on 2008-2009 data from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, the market earnings for speech-language pathologists and audiologists, are higher 
than 3 of the 4 other professions listed—yet SPLAD salaries at AU  are on the lowest rung of 
AU‘s salary scale. (See Table 17 below).  This issue is seen as crucial to the upgrading of 
departmental course offerings  to the  Master‘s level—a move that would require (a) the 
recruitment and hiring of additional faculty, and (b) the evaluation and scrutiny of  the 
university‘s hiring practices by the ASHA accreditation board.

        In addition, most universities (public and private) that utilize discipline-specific wage 
scales, remunerate Health Professions faculty according to the same salary scale. Examples of 
such programs include Western Michigan University‘s College of Health and Human Services 
and Loma Linda University‘s School of Allied Health Professions.  What follows is an 
excerpt of an email correspondence from Dr. Jean Lowry, retired chair of the Speech 
Pathology & Audiology Department at Loma Linda University.   
Every faculty member in Allied Health – PT, OT, Clinical Lab, Rad Tech, Health Info, Cardio Pulmonary, 
Speech Path, and Nutrition are all on the same pay scale.   As faculty we all do the same job of teaching, 
placing students for clinicals, supervising students as well as the other things that any faculty member 
does.  We are academics first and licensed clinicians second. (J. Lowry, Quote from personal email 
correspondence, 8/21/08). 
 
According to the 2009 NCA self study report, Andrews University‘s compensation structure 
follows a discipline-specific model based on CUPA-HR standards. The unavailability of 
CUPA-HR  data on all of AU‘s health professions precluded the possibility of a comparative 
analysis of  average college and university earnings.  See Table 18 for CUPA-HR SPLAD.

E. Opportunities for Growth 
1 . Considering the strengths of the program, frankly evaluate opportunities for 
growth in effectiveness, new directions in service, likely financial performance, new 
impact on students involved, resources necessary to achieve new levels of 
effectiveness, etc.]. 
 
Several factors suggest that the department may be ready for an academic upgrade to a 
Masters program in speech-language pathology. (An audiology graduate program would 
require a clinical doctorate program (AuD) and is not being considered at this time).  Some 
of these factors include: 
 The very positive trend with regards to enrollment, credits generated, and 
student/faculty ratio and productivity.  The SPLAD department UG student 
headcount is almost equal to Loma Linda‘s combined undergraduate and 
graduate numbers. 

52 
 
 Faculty preparedness as evidenced by the presence of doctorate-qualified 
faculty;  given that there are already two individuals with terminal degrees in 
the department, only one or two more PhDs may need to be hired.  
 A critical demand for the program—locally, nationally and denominationally.  It 
is clear that Loma Linda is not able to meet the needs of SDA students 
applying to their graduate program since their resources limit the number they 
can admit to 12-15.  According to Dr. Terry Douglas (Pre-enrollment advisor), 
admission is very competitive as evidenced by the fact that Loma Linda  
receives an average of 100-120 applications per year.  According to ASHA, 
graduate schools nationwide reject about 90% of applicants-- due not to student 
quality issues, but rather to lack of space.  Most graduate programs admit a 
maximum of only 30 students annually.   
 The scholarly and research renown of faculty.  Andrews University faculty 
publications are being referenced and cited internationally—including in 
speech- language pathology and audiology textbooks currently in use in many 
academic programs. 
 Adequate clinical supplies as a result of the clinical materials and research grants 
already obtained. 
These indicators clearly show that the SPLAD department is ready to initiate a Master‘s 
program in addition to the current undergraduate offerings. Barring faculty and space issues, 
the program has the academic, personnel and student resources necessary to move to the next 
logical step.  With an undergraduate enrollment approaching 60, a profession that requires a 
master‘s degree in order to practice, faculty personnel with demonstrated leadership skills, 

53 
 
and cutting edge clinical resources and expertise—the SPLAD department intends to seek 
permission to begin a master‘s program before the year 2012. 
            The following table benchmarks two graduate programs in speech-language pathology 
and provides data that demonstrate the feasibility of  a graduate SPLAD program at Andrews 
University.  Loma Linda University (LLU) was selected based on denominational similarity to 
Andrews, while Western Michigan University (WMU) was selected based on its geographical 
proximity.  As compared to WMU, Loma Linda has a relatively small program.  Loma Linda 
accepts undergraduate students for their junior and senior years only—about 15 per year.  
They also accept 12-15 graduate students per year.    From several points of view (size, SDA  
affiliation, etc)  LLU may be the model that AU may be best able to emulate for our Master‘s 
program.  At present, undergraduate enrollment in AU‘s SPLAD program exceeds Loma 
Linda‘s undergraduate numbers by nearly 100%, making the undergraduate program a more 
than adequate feeder program for a Master‘s program with an enrollment similar to Loma 
Linda‘s.  (That is, 20-30 graduate students—in addition to 50-60 undergraduate students).

                    The SPLAD department‘s decision to upgrade its offerings to a Master‘s  
program in speech-language pathology would entail an assessment  for accreditation by the 
Council for Academic Accreditation in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (CAA). 
The CAA  has identified six components as essential to quality education and has established 
accreditation standards accordingly.  The six components (and the criteria for meeting those 
standards) are listed below: 
1.  Administrative structure and governance (the university holds regional 
accreditation) 
2.  Faculty (faculty are qualified and competent; resources for professional 
development exist) 
3.  Curriculum--academic and clinical (2 years of graduate education; 400 clinical 
clock hours) 
4. Students (criteria for accepting students meet or exceed institutional policy) 
5. Assessment (ongoing and systematic formative and summative assessments are 
conducted) 
6. Program Resources (the institution provided adequate financial support, facilities, 
equipment, clerical and technical staff and library resources). 
In terms of the six components mentioned above, the department‘s greatest challenge will be 
in the areas of Faculty recruitment (given the scarcity of PhD-trained SDA professionals), and 
Program Resources (especially clinical space.)  These challenges have been discussed 
elsewhere in the document. 

55 
 
2.  How might cooperative or collective relationships with other programs\institutions 
contribute to future opportunities, services and effectiveness?  
 
        There are many cooperative/consortium relationships that the department could 
investigate as the introduction of a Master‘s degree is considered.   These may include both 
academic and clinical relationships, such as: 
1.  Offering a master‘s degree with a Bilingual Emphasis, in cooperation with the 
International Languages Department ( like Indiana University—Bloomington); 
2.  Offering a graduate degree with a Literacy emphasis in collaboration with the School of 
Education (like the University of Central Florida); 
3.  Participating in a consortium relationship with Loma Linda University for sharing 
faculty, and decreasing program costs.  (A similar relationship existed in the late 80s, 
when one faculty member had a joint appointment at both AU and LLU).    
4.  Partnering with the Lakeland Health System for student training and preparation. 
5.  Forming clinical relationships with Andrews‘ entities (The Crayon Box, Ruth Murdoch, 
Andrews Academy) for use as clinical sites.  
6.  Forming clinical relationships with local school districts in need of SLPs by 
encouraging them to provide scholarships in exchange for students‘ commitment to 
remain in the area for designated periods of times.  Such programs already exist in 
several states including Maryland, Arizona, Colorado and New Jersey. 
 
 

56 
 
Summarizing Statement 
          The department of Speech-Language Pathology & Audiology operates a high-quality 
program, and is poised to transform itself in new and different ways in order to meet the needs 
of twenty-first century learners. The present unavailability of graduate offerings in a 
profession where a graduate degree is the entry-level qualification (nationally and 
internationally) may be viewed as a major deterrent to departmental survival and growth. 
However, the prospect of preparing students to fulfill market needs by initiating a Master‘s 
program is also an exciting and attainable prospect.  After over 40 years of relative curricular 
stagnation, the department is ready for the challenge of expanding its program to offer both 
undergraduate and graduate degrees in the very near future.  There is no doubt that the 
university as well as the department will be strengthened by this significant step.

Michigan Speech Language Hearing Association 
Michigan Communication Disorders Personnel Advisory Group: Two Year Report May 
2006-2008 
 
Introduction: The Michigan Speech-Language-Hearing Association (MSHA) 3-year (June 
2005-2008) strategic plan has had seven areas of concentration including a focus area of 
―personnel shortages/persistent vacancies.‖ Outcome indicators established included (1) 
maintaining current state standards for certification for SLPs; (2) increasing availability of 
data related to personnel shortages and vacancies; and (3) decreasing the number of reported 
vacancies for audiologists and SLPs in education settings. To support our work, MSHA 
received the ASHA focused grant. This one-page report describes work to addressing school 
personnel issues. 
Activities, Outcomes, and Impact:  Four objectives and the impact of the work generated are 
described below.  
1. Establish a state advisory group of stakeholders to be called the Michigan Communication 
Disorders Personnel Advisory Group (Advisory Group). To date, twelve meetings (face-to-face 
and teleconference) were held with representatives from the State Board of Ed., regional public 
school administrators, regional SLPs and higher ed, and MSHA leadership. Outcomes/impact to 
date include the following: (a) greater understanding of each others‘ obligations to constituents; 
(b) identification and clarification of state regulations governing SLP employment in schools, 
including potential problems identified for state compliance with Medicaid for services in schools; 
(c) statewide dissemination of employment regulations to SLPs and training programs; (d) 
discussion of pros/cons of support personnel; (e) reinstatement of tenure for school SLPs with 
teaching certification; (f) development of collaborative relationship to address the needs of 
children with speech and language disorders; (g) the benefits of SLP licensure; and (h) 
clarification of problems related to CFY employment regulations. 
2. Gather data on supply and demand for services & SLPs within the state. A formal survey of 
MI special education administrators was conducted during, and results were disseminated in 2008. 
(See executive summary attached.) Three methods were used to gather data: snowball‖ sampling 
expert reports from school SLPs in ISD regions in the MI UP and LP; individual interviews of 
special education administrators; and quantitative survey data from the Michigan Association of 
Administrators in Special Education (MAASE). Results continue to reveal discrepant findings. 
While administrators report shortages exist, persisting vacancies are difficult to document. What 
seems to be more the case is that administrators may have a single applicant for a vacancy or one 
vacancy in a staff composed of 40 or more SLPs. SLPs are leaving MI due to poor economic 
conditions statewide, and new graduates are seeking employment where salaries are higher and 
family members can also find work. New graduates are also taking jobs in medical settings 
immediately after graduation in April and May rather than waiting for the academic school year 
positions to begin in September. Again, rather than shortages per se, interviews suggest that SLP 
recruitment and retention in rural and/or inner city schools is more related to recruitment practices 
than a lack of graduates.  Clearly, there is not a surplus of SLPs in MI, however, 120 to 150 MAs 
are graduating yearly. While, administrators believe the simple solution is to admit more students 
to educational programs or employ support personnel, the reality is that, especially today, 
economic conditions in Michigan are not conducive to retaining graduates or employees. Finally, 
employers in medical contexts are recruiting SLP employees through financial incentive and loan 

67 
 
repayment programs whereas the Michigan school employment settings are not taking advantage 
of the opportunities for federal and/or state loan forgiveness program.   
3. Partner with colleges and universities to develop a plan to meet documented shortages. Three 
educational summits, one annually each year of the strategic plan, and 2 conference calls were held 
with MI CSD chairs and directors of grad and undergrad programs. In 2008 and in response to the 
appeal of MSHA leaders, all five program directors reached consensus to increase enrollments by 
a minimum of 5 students (for a total of potentially 25 more new graduates per year) during the 
upcoming academic year despite lack of increases in resources from the State.   
4. Develop recruitment and retention plans for school SLPs and audiologists. The MSHA web-
based clearinghouse for vacancies is targeted for completion by the fall of 2008.  Even though 
MSHA has requested the opportunity to present to MAASE on the topic of effective recruitment 
and retention practices, our requests have been declined. We have shared some of these practices 
with individual administrators in defined regions; the consensus is that plans need to be locally 
constructed to take into account the unique needs of the geographic location, student body, and 
personnel needs. We have also begun conversations with legislators for loan forgiveness or tuition 
support, all with no success given MI‘s economic conditions and political intransigence.

Client Testimonial -1 
 
 
Hello!  Brynja Davis emailed me and wanted us to share our experiences at the Andrews 
Dept. of Speech, Language, and Audiology.  Our son, Alex, was diagnosed at Mayo clinic 
with ADD and learning disabilities.  That year, our dentist also recommended that Alex have 
his frenulum clipped.  It was a difficult year for us as we struggled to help Alex with his 
schoolwork. It was also a challenge for him to pronounce words  and to communicate his 
ideas to us.   
 
We had an IEP at Alex's school, and the team recommended speech therapy.  Alex had speech 
therapy at school, first with a therapist who was short-tempered and impatient, at which point 
I cancelled further sessions with her.  Then Alex had a nice therapist who did a great job with 
him, but he was with 2-3 other students during a therapy session, and he was the quiet guy in 
the room who barely spoke. 
 
I needed somewhere else to take Alex, but I didn't know where to take him.  A friend 
suggested the Speech department at Andrews, and, after I contacted Andrews, Alex was put 
on a waiting list for about 6 months.  When I received that phone call from Brynja to start 
speech therapy with her, I was so excited! 
 
I loved Brynja from the start.  She was kind, soft-spoken, and really connected with Alex from 
the very first day.  She is a mom and knows how we moms worry about their kids.  Brynja 
and her students worked with Alex one-on-one for 45 minutes every week, after Alex's school 
day.   
 
Slowly, we could understand Alex better, and he was beginning to communicate with us and 
his brothers and friends more.  He definitely has a lot to say, but he couldn't say it in a way 
that we could comprehend, that is, until his time with Brynja.  I was often left speechless 
seeing my kid who had been on the sidelines for so long getting more comfortable relaying his 
thoughts.  My elderly parents could even understand him over the phone!   
 
Still, Brynja felt like there was something missing from Alex, and so she asked the audiologist 
(I cannot remember her name, but she, too, was wonderful) to evaluate Alex.  She fit us in at 
the very end of the school year when she had so little wiggle room to work with.  She 
discovered a problem with Alex's auditory processing.  That was a piece of the puzzle that 
really helped us fit everything together.  Since that time, we have used some suggestions from 
the audiologist, such as using books on tape, sitting on a certain side of the classroom, giving 
Alex extra time to collect his thoughts for writing or just in conversation, and others.  This has 
helped us tremendously! 
 
Alex also completed the Fast ForWord program and had "tongue therapy" with April 
Gelesko.  All of these things combined have helped Alex in different ways, and we are certain 
that he is doing so well because of all of them. 
 
Brynja and her students were fabulous with Alex. They had fun games for him to play and 

103 
 
laughed at his jokes and gave him a prize at the end of the session.  He always left happy.  I 
am so pleased with the results!   Alex just completed his first year of middle school with all 
A's and B's.  Even more important, he has friends who he can really relate to, and vice-versa.  
What kind of life would Alex have had if he couldn't pronounce words and therefore his ideas 
to others?  I think he would have had a very different existence. 
 
We will forever be grateful to Brynja and her crew.  They produced results in Alex when we 
were agonizing over his speech issues. 
 
My husband and I have discussed giving a gift to Andrews in the next year or so, because they 
have been so instrumental in Alex's success.  I have also recommended Andrews speech dept. 
to a few of my friends whose children are struggling with speech problems. 
 
Thank you again!    Truly, Lynne Reuter   mom to Alex

Client Testimonial-2 
 
 
It is with gratitude to Andrews University and Dr. Lena Caesar that I express my thoughts 
about their Department of Speech Pathology and the impact it has had on my family. 
 
At age two, my son Lucas‘s pediatrician was concerned about his speech development; 
specifically, her opinion was that he was not speaking the number of words he should be for 
his age.  She recommended that he be evaluated, which started a nearly two-year search for 
services for him.  As any parent in the Southwest Michigan/Northern Indiana area whose child 
needs speech services can attest, it is difficult to find someone qualified who has openings in 
his or her practice to actually provide therapy.  Prior to coming to Andrews University, Lucas 
went through two lengthy, expensive evaluations, each which took months just to schedule.  
The second evaluation was sought after the unsatisfactory conclusion of the first: that Lucas 
needed whatever speech therapy our insurance would pay for.  The second evaluation was 
different, but similarly unhelpful, in that the recommendation was to allow him time to 
outgrow his deficits. 
 
Subsequent to the two evaluations, I made many telephone calls to professionals who worked 
with children, in order to obtain some sort of guidance on how to get help for our son.  As the 
months passed, it was clear that not only was he delayed in the number of words he spoke, but 
that the words he did use were very difficult to understand.  Interestingly, I received Dr. 
Caesar‘s name from two different professionals from Indiana and Michigan.  Both spoke 
highly of her reputation and abilities and indicated that Andrews University had helped other 
children they had referred.  When I contacted Dr. Caesar, I felt, for the first time, that Lucas 
might have a chance at learning to speak correctly before he went to school. 
 
Having observed two other speech evaluations, I feel able to opine that the evaluation Lucas 
had at Andrews was excellent. Dr. Caesar and her students spent over two hours with my son, 
testing him in many ways, including taping him for a computer assessment of his speech.  Dr. 
Caesar met at length with me, as well, to learn about Lucas and his speech, and later to inform 
me about the results of the evaluation and her treatment recommendations.  This evaluation, 
which far surpassed the others we had undergone in the variety of testing and the in-depth 
written report, cost a mere $40.00, compared to the $500.00 and $600.00 costs of the other 
evaluations.  I was even more impressed with Andrews University when I was told of the cost 
of the evaluation and the semester‘s therapy.  I had learned how hard speech services were to 
find, and I was glad that another barrier--that of unmanageable costs for treatment--had been 
removed for families who would otherwise not be able to afford help.     
 
Lucas completed a semester of speech therapy in the spring of 2009 after an hour-long session 
each week taught by Dr. Caesar and a senior student.  I sat in the hall and listened to the 
sessions (he prized his time with Dr. Caesar and wanted me out of the room!) and heard Lucas 
learn more and more.  It was clear that each session had been meticulously outlined and 
prepared, and geared specifically to the short attention span of a three-year-old boy.  Lucas 
was provided with a folder and work to take home each week, which he enjoyed.  If I delayed 

105 
 
in reviewing his homework with him on a particular day, he would get out his folder, tell me 
he was ―Dr. Caesar boy‖ and quiz me on the exercises.   
He loved going to Andrews and seeing his friends each week.  He was evaluated again at the 
end of the semester and I was provided with the written report.  The report was a great help in 
securing ongoing speech therapy for Lucas. 
 
I hope that Andrews is able to continue and expand its Speech Pathology Department.  The 
need for qualified speech therapists is great, and the department at Andrews is uniquely able 
to educate its students and provide a wonderful service to the community.  My family will 
always be thankful to Dr. Caesar and Andrews University for giving my son the ability to 
succeed in the speaking world.

Student Open-ended Comments 
 
Student  Perceptions of Department Strengths & Weaknesses 
 
Strengths 
 Weaknesses 
 
1. I think that the SPLAD program has much 
potential to grow and make the 
department even larger if the resources 
were used properly to continue to grow 
the department.  I love professors like 
Brynja and Dr. Caesar who show us 
practical ideas to use in therapy.  
1.  The amount of proper advising that you 
receive to make sure you are taking the right 
classes and that the teachers have some idea 
about the classes that they are placing you 
into. 
 2.  Not having much hands-on practical 
guidance in your sophomore and junior years 
is a waste.  
3.  There needs to be a class in the SLP 
department just like PT that is geared to 
teaching the student how to the take the GRE 
properly to prepare for graduate school.  
4.  I also think that there needs to be more 
than 10 clinical hours required in both Speech 
Pathology and Audiology.  
 
2. The strengths include the opportunity to 
participate in practicum in both audiology 
and speech pathology, the knowledgeable 
professors, and the [striving] for 
excellence of the program by professors.  
5.   Phonetics,  lack of AAC, clinical 
principles and practices. 
3. Multicultural issues, audiology practicum, 
caring faculty, family atmosphere, 
integration of spirituality, projects that 
make us think beyond the classroom. 
6.  It does not have a Masters program which 
I really wish Andrews did. 
 
4. It is small and intimate therefore you have 
good relationships with others in the 
department as well as the teachers. 
7. Not enough faculty so classes could be 
divided between teachers.  
8. Also more classes could be added to help 
us prepare more for graduate school.  
5. The willingness of the faculty to help you 
outside the class in topics that you didn‘t 
understand in class.  
6. Small class sizes which makes more 
interaction between student and teacher. 
9. Not enough facilities to face the growing 
needs of the department. 
7. Faculty involvement in all aspects of life, 
academically, spiritually, and socially. 
10. I think there needs to be a bigger facility 
for the program. 
8. The closeness of the faculty with the 
students. 
11. I believe that each professor needs to be 
well informed in both aspects of Speech and 
Audiology.  

108 
 
9. During Grad school interviews, it was 
interesting to see how many schools were 
shocked at the classes that Andrews 
offered.  
 
10. I think the greatest strength of the 
department is keeping up with the 
constant changes in speech and 
audiology.

Alumni Open-Ended Comments 
Alumni  Perceptions of Department Strengths & Weaknesses 
 
 Strengths 
Alumni Weaknesses 
1. Practicum experiences, cadaver lab 
experience, excellence in teaching 
Hearing aid technology introduction 
2. This program offers great learning 
experiences in both Audiology and Speech 
Pathology practicums. The faculty of the 
department are advanced in their knowledge 
of both speech Pathology and Audiology 
and are always open and willing to offer 
help. The classes offered are challenging 
and thorough; they go beyond the textbooks 
by applying what we are learning to real life 
situations and case studies.  
Could have benefited with more of an 
emphasis in process of evaluations and 
writing Individual Education Plans (Specially 
Designed Instruction, Goals, etc.) in the 
school setting, Alternative and Augmentative 
Communication, and strategies for delivering 
instruction in articulation/phonology. 
3. Small class sizes. Individual attention. True 
commitment to student‘s success. Quality 
faculty.  
Department size/space for training 
4. I was a step ahead of a lot of my colleagues 
when entering graduate school because I 
had a clinical foundation and a lot of my 
peers had not had clinical experience prior 
to entering graduate school. I also had a 
strong background in language and language 
disorders as well as in audiology. In 
addition, the small program really allows 
close relationships between faculty and 
students as well as increased opportunities 
for learning. Also, just having courses like 
stuttering and voice really strengthened my 
knowledge. 
When I attended Andrews, the program 
lacked courses in neurogenic communication 
disorders as well as a course in speech science 
which a majority of undergraduate programs 
had. Therefore, I entered my graduate 
program with limited knowledge in these 
areas. Also, I think the option of conducting 
research wasn't offered as much as it could 
have been. Also, an interviewing and course 
regarding multicultural issues would also be 
helpful 
5. This program is a small program; therefore, 
there are some family-like traits that it has 
that makes the students more in touch with 
each other, the faculty, and with God. The 
professors are very competent and familiar 
in the field with a great deal of experience 
that is helpful to students seeking future 
employment. The professors are also loving 
and kind, as well as showing genuine 
concern for their students well being within 
and also outside of the field. The professors 
all make the lessons interesting, using 
practical application assignments that make 
learning easier and more permanent.  
I wish that the school would fund this 
department as well as establish a master‘s 
program. This undergraduate program has 
greatly prepared me for my future in this field 
and I feel that if there were a graduate 
program for both degrees that the 
undergraduate students would greatly benefit 
and be prepared for a full-time career in the 
field. 

110 
 
6. Because it is a small department, the faculty 
is really able to connect with its students. 
Each of them has different strengths which 
help in the classroom.  
A lot of the structures/models or hands on 
things are locked in the office so if a student 
wants to study after office hours they do not 
have access to these things 
7. Clinical experience and academic courses 
No Graduate Program! I would have loved to 
stay at Andrews University for grad school! 
8. Compared to my peers in Graduate School at 
a different University, I was very well 
prepared for Graduate School and had much 
more experience and information regarding 
Speech Pathology and even Audiology! The 
clinical experience and coursework prepared 
me for Graduate School! 
Student/teacher ratio. At the time I was there 
needed more audiology focus/classes. 
9. Small and close knot. Attention to detail. 
Personalized attention. Unbiased. 
Lack of terminal degrees among faculty (in 
my time) 
Cancellation of Adult Neurogenics course 
Lack of course in counseling 
10. The quality of faculty and their interest in 
students' success 
The camaraderie encouraged among 
students of the department 
The relatively 'open-door' of the department 
Need more room, facilities to do treatment 
and practice clinical skills. 
11. Closeness of students and teachers. 
Availability of help. Great classes that apply 
to real world 
Limited experience and exposure to adult 
related speech/Language and cognitive 
disorders 
12. Faculty members who honestly care about 
their students both in and out of the 
classroom.  
Providing student with a strong and broad 
academic base to build on in graduate 
school. 
It would be nice to see a broader clinic 
experience provided in various facilities. 
More attention could also be put into courses 
that analyze the methodology of speech and 
language treatment. 
13. The professors care about students and want 
them to succeed and therefore push students 
to reach their true potential. They also make 
themselves available to students so that 
students can receive the support they need. 
The physical size of the department. I wish 
they had more room for the students to come 
and gather to review materials in the 
department or work on paperwork for clinical 
practicum. 
 
 
 
 
14. The small class size and the accessibility of 
the faculty. The professors are always 
willing to help and continue to be a mentor 
beyond graduation. 
For me, I wish that I had had more exposure 
and practice with the various diagnostic tests 
for both children and adults. 
15. - Availability of faculty 
- Family atmosphere, faculty really care about 
Hmmm. I'm guessing maybe funding!  
 My suggestions are the following: 

111 
 
19. The student 
- Strong emphasis on whole-person care, not 
just on treating a disorder or diagnosis 
- Provides excellent foundations in Audiology 
and Basic Speech-Pathology courses. 
1. Incorporate more AAC knowledge and 
training 
2. Spend more time discussing practical, 
evidence based treatment approaches 
especially targeting ASD (Autism Spectrum 
Disorders) and CAS (Childhood Apraxia of 
Speech) 
3. For observation hours have students see a 
variety of Disorder types as well as settings 
16.The availability and willingness of the staff 
to aid in the student's success, having a Christ 
centered program, having high standards for 
each student with the overall goal of enabling 
students to be competent Christ centered 
clinicians. 
I was a step ahead of a lot of my colleagues 
when entering graduate school because I had 
a clinical foundation and a lot of my peers had 
not had clinical experience prior to entering 
graduate school. I also had a strong 
background in language and language 
disorders as well as in audiology. In addition, 
the small program really allows close 
relationships between faculty and students as 
well as increased opportunities for learning. 
Also, just having courses like stuttering and 
voice really strengthened my knowledge. 
17.  The faculty and staff. They were always 
willing to help in whatever way they could. The 
education I received was very helpful and 
useful going from graduating straight into the 
field two months later as a School Speech and 
Language teacher 
We need more space to expand and we need 
to be taken more seriously. Speech, Hearing, 
and Language is VERY important! 
18. The faculty love what they do and you are 
very well prepared for graduate school in either 
Speech-Language Pathology or Audiology.
