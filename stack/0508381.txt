ABSTRACT
Sphere packings in high dimensions interest mathematicians and physicists and have
direct applications in communications theory. Remarkably, no one has been able to provide
exponential improvement on a 100-year-old lower bound on the maximal packing density due
to Minkowski in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd. The asymptotic behavior of this bound
is controlled by 2−d in high dimensions. Using an optimization procedure that we introduced
earlier [TS02] and a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings in Rd,
we obtain a conjectural lower bound on the density whose asymptotic behavior is controlled
by 2−0.77865...d, thus providing the putative exponential improvement of Minkowski’s bound.
The conjecture states that a hard-core nonnegative tempered distribution is a pair correlation
function of a translationally invariant disordered sphere packing in Rd for asymptotically
large d if and only if the Fourier transform of the autocovariance function is nonnegative.
The conjecture is supported by two explicit analytically characterized disordered packings,
numerical packing constructions in low dimensions, known necessary conditions that only have
relevance in very low dimensions, and the fact that we can recover the forms of known rigorous
lower bounds. A byproduct of our approach is an asymptotic conjectural lower bound on the
average kissing number whose behavior is controlled by 20.22134...d, which is to be compared
to the best known asymptotic lower bound on the individual kissing number of 20.2075...d.
Interestingly, our optimization procedure is precisely the dual of a primal linear program
devised by Cohn and Elkies [CE03] to obtain upper bounds on the density, and hence has
implications for linear programming bounds. This connection proves that our density estimate
can never exceed the Cohn-Elkies upper bound, regardless of the validity of our conjecture.

Introduction
A collection of congruent spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd is called a sphere
packing P if no two of the spheres have an interior point in common. The packing density or
simply density φ(P) of a sphere packing is the fraction of space Rd covered by the spheres.
We will call
φmax = sup
P ⊂Rd φ(P)
(1)
the maximal density, where the supremum is taken over all packings in Rd.
The sphere
packing problem seeks to answer the following question: Among all packings of congruent
spheres, what is the maximal packing density φmax, i.e., largest fraction of Rd covered by the
spheres, and what are the corresponding arrangements of the spheres [Rog64, CS98]? The
sphere packing problem is of great fundamental and practical interest, and arises in a variety
of contexts, including classical ground states of matter in low dimensions [CL95], the famous
Kepler conjecture for d = 3 [Hal98], error-correcting codes [CS98] and spherical codes [CS98].
For arbitrary d, the sphere packing problem is notoriously diﬃcult to solve. In the case
of packings of congruent d-dimensional spheres, the exact solution is known for the ﬁrst three
space dimensions.
For d = 1, the answer is trivial because the spheres tile the space so
that φmax = 1. In two dimensions, the optimal solution is the triangular lattice arrangement
(also called the hexagonal packing) with φmax = π/
√
12. In three dimensions, the Kepler
conjecture that the face-centered cubic lattice arrangement provides the densest packing with
φmax = π/
√
18 was only recently proved by Hales [Hal98]. For 3 < d < 10, the densest known
packings of congruent spheres are lattice packings (deﬁned below). However, for suﬃciently
large d, lattice packings are likely not to be the densest. Indeed, this paper suggests that
disordered sphere arrangements may be the densest packings as d →∞.
We review some basic deﬁnitions that we will subsequently employ. A packing is saturated
if there is no space available to add another sphere without overlapping the existing particles.
The set of lattice packings is a subset of the set of sphere packings in Rd. A lattice Λ in Rd is
a subgroup consisting of the integer linear combinations of vectors that constitute a basis for
Rd. A lattice packing PL is one in which the centers of nonoverlapping spheres are located at
the points of Λ. In a lattice packing, the space Rd can be geometrically divided into identical
regions F called fundamental cells, each of which contains the center of just one sphere. Thus,
the density of a lattice packing φL consisting of spheres of unit diameter is given by
φL = v1(1/2)
Vol(F) ,
(2)
2

where
v1(R) =
πd/2
Γ(1 + d/2)Rd
(3)
is the volume of a d-dimensional sphere of radius R and Vol(F) is the volume of a fundamental
cell. We will call
φL
max = sup
PL⊂Rd φ(PL)
(4)
the maximal density among all lattice packings in Rd. For a general packing of spheres of
unit diameter for which a density φ(P) exists, it is useful to introduce the number (or center)
density ρ deﬁned by
ρ =
φ(P)
v1(1/2),
(5)
which therefore can be interpreted as the average number of sphere centers per unit volume.
Three distinct categories of packings have been distinguished, depending on their be-
havior with respect to nonoverlapping geometric constraints and/or externally imposed vir-
tual displacements: locally jammed, collectively jammed, and strictly jammed [TS01, TDS03,
DTSC04]. Loosely speaking, these jamming categories, listed in order of increasing stringency,
reﬂect the degree of mechanical stability of the packing. A packing is locally jammed if each
particle in the system is locally trapped by its neighbors; i.e., it cannot be translated while
ﬁxing the positions of all other particles. Each sphere simply has to have at least d + 1 con-
tacts with neighboring spheres, not all in the same d-dimensional hemisphere. A collectively
jammed packing is any locally jammed conﬁguration in which no ﬁnite subset of particles can
simultaneously be continuously displaced so that its members move out of contact with one
another and with the remainder set. A strictly jammed packing is any collectively jammed
conﬁguration that disallows all globally uniform volume-nonincreasing deformations of the
system boundary. Importantly, the jamming category is generally dependent on the type of
boundary conditions imposed (e.g., hard wall or periodic boundary conditions) as well as the
shape of the boundary. The range of possible densities for a given jamming category decreases
with increasing stringency of the category. Whereas the lowest-density states of collectively
and strictly jammed packings in two or three dimensions are currently unknown, one can
achieve locally jammed packings with vanishing density [B¨or64]. This classiﬁcation of pack-
ings according to jamming criteria is closely related to the concepts of “rigid” and “stable”
packings found in the mathematics literature [CBB98].
In the next section, we summarize some previous upper and lower bounds on the maxi-
mal density. For large d, the asymptotic behavior of the well-known Minkowski lower bound
[Min05] on the maximal density is controlled by 2−d. Thus far, no one has been able to provide
3

exponential improvement on this lower bound. Using an optimization procedure and a con-
jecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings in high dimensions, we obtain
conjectural lower bounds that yield the long-sought asymptotic exponential improvement on
Minkowski’s bound. We believe that consideration of truly disordered packings is the key
notion that will yield exponential improvement on Minkowski’s lower bound. A byproduct of
our approach is an asymptotic conjectural lower bound on the average kissing number that is
superior to the best known asymptotic lower bound on the individual kissing number.

Some Previous Upper and Lower Bounds
The nonconstructive lower bounds of Minkowski [Min05] established the existence of reason-
ably dense lattice packings. He found that the maximal density φL
max among all lattice packings
for d ≥2 satisﬁes
φL
max ≥ζ(d)
2d−1,
(6)
where ζ(d) = P∞
k=1 k−d is the Riemann zeta function. Note that for large values of d, the
asymptotic behavior of the Minkowski lower bound is controlled by 2−d. Since 1905, many
extensions and generalizations of (6) have been obtained [DR47, Bal92, CS98], but none of
these investigations have been able to improve upon the dominant exponential term 2−d. It
is useful to note that the density of a saturated packing of congruent spheres in Rd for all d
satisﬁes
φ ≥1
2d.
(7)
The proof is trivial. A saturated packing of congruent spheres of unit diameter and density φ
in Rd has the property that each point in space lies within a unit distance from the center of
some sphere. Thus, a covering of the space is achieved if each sphere center is encompassed
by a sphere of unit radius and the density of this covering is 2dφ ≥1. Thus, the bound (7),
which is sometimes called the “greedy” lower bound, has same the dominant exponential term
as (6). In Section 4.1, we show that there exists a construction of a disordered packing of
congruent spheres that realizes the weaker lower bound of (7), i.e., φ = 2−d.
The best currently known lower bound on φL
max was obtained by Ball [Bal92]. He found
that
φL
max ≥2(d −1)ζ(d)
2d
.

As d →∞, Table 1 gives the dominant asymptotic behavior of several lower bounds on φL

Nontrivial upper bounds on the maximal density φmax for any sphere packing in Rd
have been derived.
Blichfeldt [Bli29] showed that the maximal packing density for all d
satisﬁes φmax ≤(d/2 + 1)2−d/2. This upper bound was improved by Rogers [Rog58, Rog64]
by an analysis of the Voronoi cells. For large d, Rogers’ upper bound asymptotically becomes
d2−d/2/e. Kabatiansky and Levenshtein [KL78] found an even stronger bound, which in the
limit d →∞yields φmax ≤2−0.5990d(1+o(1)). Cohn and Elkies [CE03] obtained and computed
linear programming upper bounds, which provided improvement over Rogers’ upper bound for
dimensions 4 through 36. They also conjectured that their approach could be used to prove
sharp bounds in 8 and 24 dimensions. Indeed, Cohn and Kumar [CK04] used these techniques
to prove that the Leech lattice is the unique densest lattice in ℜ24. They also proved that no
sphere packing in ℜ24 can exceed the density of the Leech lattice by a factor of more than
1 + 1.65 × 10−30, and gave a new proof that E8 is the unique densest lattice in ℜ8. Table 2
provides the dominant asymptotic behavior of several upper bounds on φmax for large d.

Realizability of Point Processes
As will be described in Section 5, our new approach to lower bounds on the density of sphere
packings in Rd rests on whether certain one- and two-point correlation functions are realizable
by sphere packings. As we will discuss, a sphere packing can be regarded to be a special
case of a point process and so a more general question concerns the necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for the realizability of point processes in Rd. Before discussing the realizability of
5

point processes, it is useful to recall some basic results from the theory of spatial stochastic
(or random) processes. Let x ≡(x1, x2, . . . xd) denote a vector position in Rd. Consider a
stochastic process {Y (x; ω) : x ∈Rd; ω ∈Ω}, where Y (x; ω) is a real-valued random variable,
ω is a realization generated by the stochastic process and (Ω, F, P) is a probability space
(i.e., Ωis a sample space, F is a σ-algebra of measurable subsets of Ω, and P is a probability
measure). For simplicity, we will often suppress the variable ω.
3.1
Ordinary Stochastic Processes
We will assume that the stochastic process is translationally invariant (i.e., statistically ho-
mogeneous in space). Let us further assume that the mean µ = ⟨Y (x)⟩and autocovariance
function
χ(r) = ⟨[Y (x) −µ][Y (x + r) −µ]⟩
(9)
exist, where angular brackets denote an expectation, i.e., an average over all realizations. The
fact that the mean µ and autocovariance function χ(r) are independent of the variable x is a
consequence of the translational invariance of the measure. Clearly,
χ(0) = ⟨Y 2⟩−µ2
(10)
and it follows from Schwarz’s inequality that
|χ(r)| ≤⟨Y 2⟩−µ2.
(11)
It immediately follows [Lo`e63] that the autocovariance function χ(r) must be positive semidef-
inite (nonnegative) in the sense that for any ﬁnite number of spatial locations r1, r2, . . . , rm
in Rd and arbitrary real numbers a1, a2, . . . , am,
m
X
i=1
m
X
j=1
aiajχ( bfri −rj) ≥0.
(12)
It is clear that ⟨[Y (x + r) −Y (x)]2⟩= 2[χ(0) −χ(r)]. Thus, if the autocovariance function
χ(r) is continuous at the point r = 0, the process Y (x) on Rd will be mean square continuous,
i.e., limr→0⟨[Y (x + r) −Y (x)]2⟩= 0 for all x. Stochastic processes that are continuous in the
mean square sense will be called ordinary. It is simple to show that if χ(r) is continuous at
r = 0, it is continuous for all r.
Does every continuous positive semideﬁnite function f(r) correspond to a translationally
invariant ordinary stochastic process with a continuous autocovariance χ(r)? The answer is
6

yes, and a proof is given in the book by Lo`eve [Lo`e63] for stochastic processes in time. Here
we state without proof the generalization to stochastic processes in space.
Theorem 3.1 A continuous function f(r) on Rd is an autocovariance function of a transla-
tionally invariant ordinary stochastic process if and only if it is positive semideﬁnite.
Remark:
Assuming that f(r) is positive semideﬁnite, one needs to show that there exists a random
variable Y (x) on Rd such that ⟨[Y (x)−µ][Y (x+r)−µ]⟩= f(r). This is done by demonstrating
that there exists a Gaussian (normal) process for every autocovariance function [Lo`e63]. A
crucial property of a Gaussian process is that its full probability distribution is completely
determined by its mean and autocovariance.
The nonnegativity condition (12) is diﬃcult to check. It turns out that it is easier to es-
tablish the existence of an autocovariance function by appealing to its spectral representation.
We denote the space of absolutely integrable functions on Rd by L1. The Fourier transform
of an L1 function f : Rd →ℜis deﬁned by
˜f(k) =
Z
Rd f(r)e−ik · r dr.
(13)
If f : Rd →R is a radial function, i.e., f depends only on the modulus r = |r| of the vector
r, then its Fourier transform given by
˜f(k) = (2π)
d
2
Z ∞
0
rd−1f(r)J(d/2)−1(kr)
(kr)(d/2)−1 dr,
(14)
where k is the modulus of the wave vector k and Jν(x) is the Bessel function of order ν. The
Wiener–Khintchine theorem states that a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence
of a continuous autocovariance function χ(r) of a translationally invariant stochastic process
{Y (x) : x ∈Rd} is that its Fourier transform is nonnegative everywhere, i.e., ˜χ(k) ≥0 for all
k [Yag87, Tor02]. The key “necessary” part of the proof of this theorem rests on a well-known
theorem due to Bochner [Boc36], which states that any continuous function f(r) is positive
semideﬁnite in the sense of (12) if and only if it has a Fourier–Stieltjes representation with a
nonnegative bounded measure.

3.2
Generalized Stochastic Processes
The types of autocovariance functions that we are interested in must allow for generalized
functions, such as Dirac delta functions. The Weiner-Khintchine theorem has been extended
to autocovariances in the class of generalized functions called tempered distributions, i.e.,
continuous linear functionals on the space S of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions Φ(x) such
that Φ(x) as well as all of its derivatives decay faster than polynomially. Nonnegative tempered
distributions are nonnegative unbounded measures ν on Rd such that
Z
Rd
dν(r)
(1 + |r|)n < ∞
(15)
for some n.
The interested reader is referred to the books by Gel’fand [GV64] and Ya-
glom [Yag87] for details about generalized stochastic processes. It suﬃces to say here that
{Y (Φ(x)) : x ∈Rd} is a generalized stochastic process if for each Φ(x) ∈S we have a random
variable Y (Φ(x)) that is linear and mean square continuous in Φ. Then the mean is the linear
functional µ(Φ(x)) = ⟨Y (Φ1(x))⟩and the autocovariance function is the bilinear functional
⟨[Y (Φ1(x))−µ(Φ(x1))][Y (Φ2(x+r))−µ(Φ(x2))]⟩, which we still denote by χ(r) for simplicity.
Theorem 3.2 A necessary and suﬃcient condition for an autocovariance function χ(r) to
come from a translationally invariant generalized stochastic process {Y (Φ(x)) : x ∈Rd} is
that that its Fourier transform ˜χ(k) is a nonnegative tempered distribution.
Remark:
We will call Theorem 3.2 the generalized Wiener-Khintchine theorem.
3.3
Stochastic Point Processes
Loosely speaking, a stochastic point process in Rd is deﬁned as a mapping from a probability
space to conﬁgurations of points x1, x2, x3 . . . in Rd. More precisely, let X denote the set of
conﬁgurations such that each conﬁguration x ∈X is a subset of Rd that satisﬁes two regularity
conditions: (i) there are no multiple points (xi ̸= xj if i ̸= j) and (ii) each bounded subset
of Rd must contain only a ﬁnite number of points of x. We denote by N(B) the number of
points within x∩B, B ∈B, where B is the ring of bounded Borel sets in Rd. Thus, we always
have N(B) < ∞for B ∈B but the possibility N(Rd) = ∞is not excluded. We denote by
U the minimal σ-algebra of subsets of X that renders all of the functions N(B) measurable.
8

Let (Ω, F, P) be a probability space. Any measurable map x(ω) : Ω→X, ω ∈Ω, is called a
stochastic point process [SKM95]. Point processes belong to the class of generalized stochastic
processes.
A particular realization of a point process in Rd can formally be characterized by the
random variable
n(r) =
∞
X
i=1
δ(r −xi)
(16)
called the “local” density at position r, where δ(r) is a d-dimensional Dirac delta function.
The “randomness” of the point process enters through the positions x1, x2, . . .. Let us call
IA(r) =
1,
r ∈A,
0,
r /∈A,
(17)
the indicator function of a measurable set A ⊂Rd, which we also call a “window.” For a
particular realization, the number of points N(A) within such a window is given by
N(A)
=
Z
Rd n(r)IA(r) dr
=
∞
X
i=1
Z
Rd δ(r −xi)IA(r) dr
=
X
i≥1
IA(xi).
(18)
Note that this random setting is quite general. It incorporates cases in which the location of
the points are deterministically known, such as a lattice. A packing of congruent spheres of
unit diameter is simply a point process in which any pair of points cannot be closer than a
unit distance from one another.
It is known that the probability measure on (X, U) exists provided that the inﬁnite set
of n-point correlation functions ρn, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . meet certain conditions [Len73, Len75a,
Len75b].
The n-point correlation function ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) is the contribution to the ex-
pectation ⟨n(r1)n(r2) · · ·n(rn)⟩when the indices on the sums are not equal to one another,
i.e.,
ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) =
*
∞
X
i1̸=i2̸=···̸=in
δ(r1 −xi1)δ(r2 −xi2) · · · δ(rn −xin)
+
.
(19)
Note that the distribution-valued function ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) also has a probabilistic interpreta-
tion: apart from trivial constants, it is the probability density function associated with ﬁnding
n diﬀerent points at positions r1, r2, . . . , rn. For this reason, ρn is also called the n-particle
density and, for any n, has the nonnegativity property
ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) ≥0
∀ri ∈Rd
(i = 1, 2, . . . n).
(20)
9

Translational invariance means that for every constant vector y in Rd, ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) =
ρn(r1 + y, . . . , rn + y), which implies that
ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) = ρngn(r12, . . . , r1n),
(21)
where ρ is the number (or center) density and gn(r12, . . . , r1n) is the n-particle correlation
function, which depends on the relative positions r12, r13, . . ., where rij ≡rj −ri and we have
chosen the origin to be at r1.
For such point processes without long-range order, gn(r12, . . . , r1n) →1 when the points
(or “particles”) are mutually far from one another, i.e., as |rij| →∞(1 ≤i < j < ∞),
ρn(r1, r2, . . . , rn) →ρn. Thus, the deviation of gn from unity provides a measure of the degree
of spatial correlation between the particles, with unity corresponding to no spatial correlation.
Note that for a translationally invariant Poisson point process, gn is unity for all values of its
argument.
As we indicated in the beginning of this section, the ﬁrst two correlation functions,
ρ1(r1) = ρ and ρ2(r1, r2) = ρ2g2(r), for translationally invariant point processes are of central
concern in this paper. If the point process is also rotationally invariant (statistically isotropic),
then g2 depends on the radial distance r = |r| only, i.e.,
g2(r) = g2(r),
(22)
and is referred to as the radial distribution function. Strictly speaking, one should use diﬀerent
notation for the left and right members of Eq. (22), but to conform to conventional statistical-
mechanical usage, we invoke the common notation for both. Because ρ2(r1, r2)/ρ = ρg2(r) is
a conditional joint probability density, then
Z(r1, r2) =
Z r2
r1
ρs1(r)g2(r) dr
(23)
is the expected number of points at radial distances between r1 and r2 from a randomly chosen
point. Here s1(r) is the surface area of a d-dimensional sphere of radius r given by
s1(r) = 2πd/2rd−1
Γ(d/2) .
(24)
For a packing of congruent spheres of unit diameter, g(r) = 0 for 0 ≤r < 1, i.e.,
supp(g2) ⊆{r : r ≥1}.
(25)
Note that the radial distribution function g2(r) (or any of the ρn) for a point process must be
able to incorporate Dirac delta functions. We will speciﬁcally consider those radial distribution
10

functions that are nonnegative distributions. For example, g2(r) for a lattice packing is the
rotational symmetrization of the sum of delta functions at lattice points at a radial distance
r from any lattice point [TS03].
For a translationally invariant point process, the autocovariance function χ(r) is related
to the pair correlation function via
χ(r) = ρδ(r) + ρ2h(r),
(26)
where
h(r) ≡g2(r) −1,
(27)
is the total correlation function. This relation is obtained using deﬁnitions (9) and (16) with
Y (x) = n(x). Note that χ(r) = ρδ(r) (i.e., h = 0) for a translationally invariant Poisson point
process. Positive and negative pair correlations are deﬁned as those instances in which h is
positive (i.e., g2 > 1) and h is negative (i.e., g2 < 1), respectively. The Fourier transform of
the distribution-valued function χ(r) is given by
˜χ(k) = ρ + ρ2˜h(k),
(28)
where ˜h(k) is the Fourier transform of h(r). It is common practice in statistical physics to
deal with a function trivially related to the spectral function ˜χ(k) called the structure factor
S(k), i.e.,
S(k) ≡˜χ(k)
ρ
= 1 + ρ˜h(k).
(29)
A natural question to ask at this point is the following: Given a positive number density ρ
and a pair correlation function g2(r), does there exist a translationally invariant point process
in Rd with measure P for which ρ and g2 are one-point and two-point correlation functions,
respectively.
Two obvious nonnegativity conditions [TS02] that must be satisﬁed are the
following:
g2(r) ≥0
for all
r
(30)
and
S(k) = 1 + ρ˜h(k) ≥0
for all
k.
(31)
The ﬁrst condition is trivial and comes from (20) with n = 2.
The second condition is
nontrivial and derives from the generalized Wiener-Khintchine theorem (3.2) using relations
(28) and (29).
However, for realizability of point processes in arbitrary dimension d, the
two standard conditions (30) and (31) are only necessary, not necessary and suﬃcient. The
11

same state of aﬀairs applies to the theory of random sets [Tor02], where it is known that the
Wiener-Khintchine theorem only provides a necessary condition on realizable autocovariance
functions. The simplest example of a random set is one in which Rd is partitioned into two
disjoint regions (phases) but with an interface that is only known in a probabilistic sense. (A
packing can therefore be viewed as a special random set). Thus, a random set is described
by a random variable that is the indicator function for a particular phase, i.e., it is a binary
stochastic process. The class of autocovariances that comes from a binary stochastic process
is a subclass of the total class that comes from an ordinary process {Y (x) : x ∈Rd} and
meets the existence condition of Theorem 3.2. Similarly, the class of autocovariances that
comes from a point process is a subset of of a generalized process {Y (Φ(x)) : x ∈Rd} and
therefore the existence condition of Theorem 3.2 is only necessary.
It has recently come to light that a positive g2 for a positive ρ must satisfy an uncount-
able number of necessary and suﬃcient conditions for it to correspond to a realizable point
process [CL04]. However, these conditions are very diﬃcult (or, more likely, impossible) to
check for arbitrary dimension. In other words, given ρ1 = ρ and ρ2 = ρ2g2, it is diﬃcult to
ascertain if there are some higher-order functions ρ3, ρ4, . . . for which these one- and two-point
correlation functions hold. Thus, an important practical problem becomes the determination
of a manageable number of necessary conditions that can be readily checked.
One such additional necessary condition, obtained by Yamada [Yam61], is concerned with
σ2(A) ≡⟨(N(A) −⟨N(A)⟩)2⟩, the variance in the number of points N(A) contained within a
window A ⊂Rd. Speciﬁcally, he showed that
σ2(A) ≥θ(1 −θ),
(32)
where θ is the fractional part of the expected number of points ρ|A| contained in the window.
This inequality is a consequence of the fact that the number of points N(A) within a window
at some ﬁxed position is an integer, not a continuous variable, and sets a lower limit on the
number variance. We note in passing that the determination of the number variance for lattice
point patterns is an outstanding problem in number theory [Ken48, KR53, SS05]. The number
variance for a speciﬁc choice of A is necessarily a positive number and generally related to the
total pair correlation function h(r) for a translationally invariant point process [TS03]. In the
special case of a spherical window of radius R in Rd, it is explicitly given by
σ2(R) = ρv1(R)

1 + ρ
Z
Rd h(r)α2(r; R) dr

≥θ(1 −θ),
(33)
where σ2(R) is the number variance for a spherical window of radius R in Rd, v1(R) is the
volume of the window, and α2(r; R) is the volume common to two spherical windows of radius
12

R whose centers are separated by a distance r divided by v1(R). We will call α2(r; R) the
scaled intersection volume. The lower bound (33) provides another integral condition on the
pair correlation function.
For large R, it has been proved that σ2(R) cannot grow more slowly than γRd−1, where
γ is a positive constant [Bec87]. This implies that the Yamada lower bound in (33) is always
satisﬁed for for suﬃciently large R for any d ≥2. In fact, we have not been able to construct
any examples of a pair correlation function g2(r) at some number density ρ that satisfy the
two nonnegativity conditions (30) and (31) and simultaneously violate the Yamada condition
for any R and any d ≥2.
Thus, it appears that the Yamada condition is most relevant
in one dimension, especially in those cases when σ2(R) is bounded.
We note that point
processes (translationally invariant or not) for which σ2(R) ∼Rd−1 for large R are examples
of hyperuniform point patterns [TS03].
This classiﬁcation includes all lattices as well as
aperiodic point patterns.
Hyperuniformity implies that the structure factor S(k) has the
following small k behavior:
lim
k→0 S(k) = 0.
(34)
The scaled intersection volume α2(r; R) appearing in (33) will play a prominent role in
this paper. It has support in the interval [0, 2R), the range [0, 1] and the following integral
representation:
α2(r; R) = c(d)
Z cos−1(r/(2R))
0
sind(θ) dθ,
(35)
where c(d) is the d-dimensional constant given by
c(d) =
2Γ(1 + d/2)
π1/2Γ((d + 1)/2).
(36)
Following the analysis given by Torquato and Stillinger [TS03] for low dimensions, we obtain
the following new series representation of the scaled intersection volume α2(r; R) for r ≤2R
and for any d:
α(r; R) = 1 −c(d)x + c(d)

x2n−1,
(37)
where x = r/(2R). This is easily proved with the help of Maple. For even dimensions, relation
(37) is an inﬁnite series, but for odd dimensions, the series truncates such that α2(r; R) is
a univariate polynomial of degree d. Except for the ﬁrst term of unity, all of the terms in
(37) involve only odd powers of x. Figure 1 shows graphs of the scaled intersection volume
α2(r; R) as a function of r for the ﬁrst ﬁve space dimensions. For any dimension, α(r; R) is a
13

monotonically decreasing function of r. At a ﬁxed value of r in the interval (0, 2R), α2(r; R)
is a monotonically decreasing function of the dimension d. For large d, we will subsequently
make use of the asymptotic result

Before closing this section, it is useful to note that there has been some recent work that
demonstrates the existence of point processes for a speciﬁc ρ and g2 provided that ρ and g2
meet certain restrictions. For example, Ambartzumian and Sukiasian proved the existence
of point processes that come from Gibbs measures for a special g2 for suﬃciently small ρ
[AS91]. Determinantal point processes have been considered by Soshnikov [Sos00] and Costin
and Lebowitz [CL04]. Costin and Lebowitz have also studied certain one-dimensional renewal
point processes [CL04]. Stillinger and Torquato [ST04] discussed the possible existence of
a general interparticle pair potential (associated with a Gibbs measure) for a given ρ and
g2 using a cluster expansion procedure but did not address the issue of convergence of this
expansion. Koralov [Kor05] indeed proves the existence of a pair potential on a lattice (with
the restriction of single occupancy per lattice site) for which ρ is the density and g2 is the
pair correlation function for suﬃciently small ρ and g2. There is no reason to believe that
Koralov’s proof is not directly extendable to the case of a point process corresponding to
a sphere packing in Rd, where the nonoverlap condition is the analog of single occupancy
on the lattice. Thus, we expect that one can prove the existence of a pair potential in Rd
14

corresponding to a sphere packing for a given ρ and g2 provided that ρ and g2 suﬃciently
small.

Disordered Packings in High Dimensions and the Decor-
relation Principle
In this section, we examine the asymptotic behavior of certain disordered packings in high
dimensions and show that unconstrained spatial correlations vanish asymptotically, yielding
a decorrelation principle. We deﬁne a disordered packing in Rd to be one in which the pair
correlation function g2(r) decays to its long-range value of unity faster than |r|−d−ε for some
ε > 0. The decorrelation principle as well as a number of other results (that will be discussed
in Section 5) motivate us to propose a conjecture in Section 5 that describes the circumstances
in which the two standard nonnegativity conditions (30) and (31) are necessary and suﬃcient
to ensure the existence of a disordered sphere packing.
4.1
Example 1: Disordered Sequential Packings
First we show that there exists a disordered sphere packing that realizes the greedy lower
bound (7) (φ = 1/2d) for all d. Then we study the asymptotic properties of the n-particle
correlation functions in the large dimension limit.
The disordered packing that achieves the greedy lower bound is a special case of a general-
ization of the so-called random sequential addition (RSA) process [Tor02]. This generalization,
which we introduce here, is a subset of the Poisson point process. Speciﬁcally, the centers of
“test” spheres of unit diameter arrive continually throughout Rd during time t ≥0 according
to a translationally invariant Poisson process of density per unit time η, i.e., η is the number
of points per unit volume and time. Therefore, the expected number of centers in a region
of volume Ωduring time t is ηΩt and the probability that this region is empty of centers is
exp(−ηΩt). However, this Poisson distribution of test spheres is not a packing because the
spheres can overlap. To create a packing from this point process, one must remove test spheres
such that no sphere center can lie within a spherical region of unit radius from any sphere
center. Without loss of generality, we will set η = 1.
There is a variety of ways of achieving this “thinning” process such that the subset of
points correspond to a sphere packing. One obvious rule is to retain a test sphere at time t only
15

if it does not overlap a sphere that was successfully added to the packing at an earlier time.
This criterion deﬁnes the well-known RSA process in Rd [Tor02], and is clearly a statistically
homogeneous and isotropic sphere packing in Rd with a time-dependent density φ(t). In the
limit t →∞, the RSA process corresponds to a saturated packing with a maximal or saturation
density φs(∞) ≡limt→∞φ(t). In one dimension, the RSA process is commonly known as the
“car parking problem”, which Re´nyi showed has a saturation density φs(∞) = 0.7476 . . .
[Re´n63]. For 2 ≤d < ∞, an exact determination of φs(∞) is not possible, but estimates for
it have been obtained via computer experiments for low dimensions [Tor02]. However, as we
will discuss below, the standard RSA process at small times (or, equivalently, small densities)
can be analyzed exactly.
Another thinning criterion retains a test sphere centered at position r at time t if no other
test sphere is within a unit radial distance from r for the time interval κt prior to t, where κ
is a positive constant in the interval [0, 1]. This packing is a subset of the RSA packing, and
therefore we refer to it as the generalized RSA process. Note that when κ = 0, the standard
RSA process is recovered, and when κ = 1, a relatively unknown model due to Mat´ern [Mat86]
is recovered. The latter is amenable to exact analysis.
The time-dependent density φ(t) in the case of the generalized RSA process with κ = 1
is easily obtained. (Note that for any 0 < κ ≤1, the generalized RSA process is always an
unsaturated packing.) In this packing, a test sphere at time t is accepted only if does not
overlap an existing sphere in the packing as well as any previously rejected test sphere (which
we will call “ghost” spheres.) An overlap cannot occur if a test sphere is outside a unit radius
of any successfully added sphere or ghost sphere. Because of the underlying Poisson process,
the probability that a trial sphere is retained at time t is given by exp(−v1(1)t), where v1(1) is
the volume of a sphere of unit radius having the same center as the retained sphere of radius
1/2. Therefore, the expected number density ρ(t) and packing density φ(t) at any time t are
respectively given by
ρ(t) =
Z t
0
exp(−v1(1)t′) dt′ =
1
v1(1)[1 −exp(−v1(1)t)]
(39)
and
φ(t) = ρ(t)v1(1/2) = 1
2d[1 −exp(−v1(1)t)].
(40)
We see that φ(t) is a monotonically increasing function of t. This result was ﬁrst given by
Mat´ern using a diﬀerent approach and he also gave a formal expression for the time-dependent
radial distribution function g2(r; t) (see Section 3). Here we present an explicit expression for
16

g2(r; t) at time t for any dimension d:
g2(r; t) =
Θ(r −1)

Here

(42)
is the unit step function and
β2(r; R) = 2 −α2(r; R)
(43)
is the union volume of two spheres of radius R (whose centers are separated by a distance r)
divided by the volume of a sphere of radius R and α2(r; R) is the scaled intersection volume
of two such spheres given by (35). Our approach for obtaining (41) is diﬀerent than Mat´ern’s
and details are given elsewhere [TS06].
It is useful to note that at small times or, equivalently, low densities, formula (40) yields
the asymptotic expansion φ(t) = v1(1)t/2d −v2
1(1)t2/2d+1 + O(t3), which when inverted yields
t = 2dφ/v1(1) + 2d−1φ2 + O(φ3). Substitution of this last result into (41) gives
g2(r; φ) = Θ(r −1) + O(φ3),
(44)
which implies that g2(r; φ) tends to the unit step function Θ(r −1) as φ →0 for any ﬁnite d.

(46)
We see that the greedy lower-bound limit on the density is achieved in the inﬁnite-time limit
for this sequential but unsaturated packing. This is the ﬁrst time that such an observation
has been made. Obviously, for any 0 ≤κ < 1, the maximum (inﬁnite-time) density of the
generalized RSA packing is bounded from below by 1/2d (the maximum density for κ = 1).
Note also that because β2(r; 1) is equal to 2 for r ≥2, g2(r; ∞) = 1 for r ≥2, i.e., spatial
correlations vanish identically for all pair distances except those in the small interval [0, 2).
Even the positive correlations exhibited for 1 < r < 2 are rather weak and decrease with
increasing dimension.
The function g2(r; ∞) achieves its largest value at r = 1+ in any
dimension and for d = 1, g2(1+; ∞) = 4/3.
The radial distribution function g2(r; ∞) is
plotted in Fig. 2 for the ﬁrst ﬁve space dimensions. Using the asymptotic result (38) and
relation (46), it is seen that for large d,

and thus g2(r; ∞) tends to the unit step function Θ(r −1) exponentially fast as d →∞
because the scaled intersection volume α2(1; 1) vanishes exponentially fast.
The higher-order correlation functions for this model have not been given previously. In
another work [TS06], we use an approach diﬀerent from the one used by Mat´ern to obtain not
only g2 but an explicit formula for the general n-particle correlation function gn, deﬁned by
(21), for any time t and n and for arbitrary dimension d. To our knowledge, this represents the
ﬁrst exactly solvable disordered sphere packing model for any d. These details are somewhat
tangential to the present work and for our purposes it suﬃces to state the ﬁnal result in the
limit t →∞for n ≥2:
gn(r1, . . . , rn; ∞) =

where the sum is over all the n distinguishable ways of choosing n−1 positions from n positions
r1, . . . rn and the arguments of gn−1 are the associated n−1 positions, which we denote by Qi,
18

and g1 ≡1. Moreover, βn(r1, . . . , rn; R) is the union volume of n congruent spheres of radius
R, whose centers are located at r1, . . . , rn, where rij = |rj −ri| for all 1 ≤i < j ≤n, divided
by the volume of a sphere of radius R.
Lemma 4.1 In the limit d →∞, the n-particle correlation function gn(r1, . . . , rn; ∞) ∼1
uniformly in (r1, . . . , rn) ∈Rd such that rij ≥1 for all 1 ≤i < j ≤n. If rij < 1 for any pair
of points ri and rj, then gn(r1, . . . , rn; ∞) = 0.
Proof: The second part of the Lemma is the trivial requirement for a packing. Whenever
rij ≥1 for all 1 ≤i < j ≤n, it is clear from (48) that we have the following upper and lower
bounds on the n-particle correlation function:
n

n−1 denotes the largest possible value of gn−1. The scaled union volume βn of n spheres

(50)
but since the scaled intersection volume of two spheres α2(r; 1) attains its maximum value for
r ≥1 when r = 1, we also have
n −n(n −1)
2
α2(1; 1) ≤βn ≤n.
(51)
Use of this inequality and the recursive relation (48) yields the bounds
1 ≤gn ≤

.
(52)
Using the asymptotic result (38), we see that the upper bound tends to the lower bound for
any given n as d →∞, which proves the Lemma.
In summary, the Lemma enables us to conclude that in the limit d →∞and for φ = 1/2d
gn(r12, . . . , r1n; ∞) ∼
n
Y
i<j
g2(rij; ∞),
(53)
where
g2(r; ∞) ∼Θ(r −1).
(54)
Importantly, we see that the asymptotic behavior of g2 in the low-density limit φ →0
for any d [cf. (44)] is the same as the high-dimensional limit d →∞[cf. (54)], i.e., spatial
19

correlations, which exist for positive densities at ﬁxed d, vanish for pair distances beyond
the hard-core diameter. Note also that gn for n ≥3 asymptotically factorizes into products
involving only the pair correlation function g2.
Is the similarity between the low-density
and high-dimensional limits for this model of a disordered packing a general characteristic of
disordered packings? In what follows, we discuss another disordered packing that has this
attribute and subsequently formulate what we refer to as a “decorrelation principle.”
4.2
Example 2: The Classic Gibbsian Hard-Sphere Packing
The statistical mechanics of the classic Gibbsian hard-sphere packing is well established (see
[Tor02] and references therein). The purpose of this subsection is simply to collect some results
that motivate the decorrelation principle. Let ΦN(rN) be the N-body interaction potential
for a ﬁnite but large number of particles with conﬁguration rN ≡{r1, r2, . . . , rN} in a volume
V in Rd at absolute temperature T. A large collection of such systems in which N, V and
T are ﬁxed but in which the particle conﬁgurations are otherwise free to vary is called the
Gibbs canonical ensemble. Our interest is in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., the distinguished
limit in which N →∞and V →∞such that the number density ρ = N/V exists. For a
Gibbs canonical ensemble, when the n-particle densities ρn (deﬁned in Section 3) exist, they
are entirely determined by the interaction potential ΦN(rN). For a hard-sphere packing, the
interaction potential is given by a sum of pairwise terms such that
ΦN(rN) =
N
X
i<j
u2(|rj −ri|).
(55)
where u2(r) is the pair potential deﬁned by
u2(r) =
(
+ ∞,
r < 1,
0,
r ≥1,
(56)
Thus, the particles do not interact for interparticle separation distances greater than or equal
to unity but experience an inﬁnite repulsive force for distances less than unity. The hard
spheres have kinetic energy, and therefore a temperature, but the temperature enters in a
trivial way because the conﬁgurational correlations between the spheres are independent of the
temperature. We call this the classic equilibrium sphere packing, which is both translationally
and rotationally invariant.
In one dimension, the n-particle densities ρn for such packings are known exactly in
the thermodynamic limit. The density φ lies in the interval [0, 1] but this one-dimensional

packing is devoid of a discontinuous (ﬁrst-order) transition from a disordered (liquid) phase to
an ordered (solid) phase. Although a rigorous proof for the existence of a liquid-to-solid phase
transition in two or three dimensions is not yet available, there is overwhelming numerical
evidence (as obtained from computer simulations) that such a transformation takes place at
suﬃciently high densities. The maximal densities for equilibrium sphere packings in two and
three dimensions are φmax = π/
√
12 and φmax = π/
√
18, respectively, i.e., they correspond to
the density of the densest sphere packing in the respective dimension.
Figure 3 shows the three-dimensional radial distribution function as obtained from com-
puter simulations for a density φ = 0.49, which is near the maximum value for the stable
disordered branch. It is seen that the packing exhibits short-range order [i.e., g2(r) has both
positive and negative correlations for small r], but g2(r) decays to its long-range value expo-
nentially fast after several diameters. By contrast, in the limit d →∞, it has been shown that
the “pressure” [Rue99] of an equilibrium packing is exactly given by the ﬁrst two terms of its
asymptotic low-density expansion for some positive density interval [0, φ0] [WRF87, FP99].
(Roughly speaking, the pressure is the average force per unit area acting on an “imaginary
planar wall” in the packing due collisions between the spheres and the wall.) Frisch and Percus
[FP99] have established, albeit not rigorously, that φ0 = 1/2d. This result for the pressure
implies that the leading-order term of the low-density expansion of the radial distribution

function in arbitrary dimension [Tor02]
g2(r) = Θ(r −1)

becomes asymptotically exact in the limit d →∞in the same density interval. The presence
of the unit step function Θ(r −1) in relation (57) means that the scaled intersection volume
α2(r; 1) need only be considered for values of r in the interval [1, 2]. Since α2(r; 1) is largest
when r = 1 for 1 ≤r ≤2 and α2(1; 1) has the asymptotic behavior (38), the product
2dα2(1; 1)φ vanishes no more slowly than (6/π)1/2/[(4/3)d/2d1/2] in the limit d →∞for 0 ≤
φ ≤1/2d, and therefore g2(r) tends to Θ(r −1) exponentially fast. In summary, we see again
that spatial correlations that exist in low dimensions for r > 1 completely vanish in the limit
d →∞. Moreover, this is yet another disordered packing model in which the high-dimensional
asymptotic behavior corresponds to the low-density asymptotic behavior.
The corresponding n-particle correlation function gn, deﬁned by (21), in the low-density
limit [Sal58] is given by
gn(r12, . . . , r1n) =
n
Y
i<j
g2(rij)
h
1 + 2dαn(r12, . . . , r1n; 1)φ + O(φ2)

(58)
where αn(r12, . . . , r1n; R) is the intersection volume of n congruent spheres of radius R (whose
centers are located at r1, . . . , rn, where rij = rj −ri for all 1 ≤i < j ≤n) divided by the
volume of a sphere of radius R. The scaled intersection volume αn(r12, . . . , r1n; R)/n has the
range [0, 1]. Now since α2(rij, 1) ≥αn(r12, . . . , r1n; 1) for any pair distance rij = |rij| such
that 1 ≤i < j ≤n, then it follows from the analysis above that in the limit d →∞for
0 ≤φ ≤1/2d
g2(r) ∼Θ(r −1)
(59)
and
gn(r12, . . . , r1n) ∼
n
Y
i<j
g2(rij).
(60)
Again, as in the generalized RSA example with κ = 1, gn factorizes into products involving
only g2’s in the limit d →∞. Moreover, we should also note that the standard RSA process
(generalized RSA process with κ = 0) has precisely the same asymptotic low-density behavior
as the standard Gibbs hard-sphere model [Tor02]. More precisely, these two models share
the same low-density expansions of the gn through terms of order φ and therefore the same
asymptotic expressions (59) and (60).
22

4.3
Decorrelation Principle
The previous two examples illustrate two important and related asymptotic properties that
are expected to apply to all disordered packings:
1. the high-dimensional asymptotic behavior of g2 is the same as the asymptotic behavior
in the low-density limit for any ﬁnite d, i.e., unconstrained spatial correlations, which
exist for positive densities at ﬁxed d, vanish asymptotically for pair distances beyond
the hard-core diameter in the high-dimensional limit;
2. and gn for n ≥3 asymptotically can be inferred from a knowledge of only the pair
correlation function g2 and number density ρ.
What is the explanation for these two related asymptotic properties? Because we know from
the Kabatiansky and Levenshtein (1979) asymptotic upper bound on the maximal density that
φ must go to zero at least as fast as 2−0.5990d for large d, unconstrained spatial correlations
between spheres must vanish, i.e., statistical independence is established. (An example of
constrained spatial correlations is described below.) Such a decorrelation means that the gn
for n ≥3 are determined entirely from a knowledge of the decorrelated pair correlation function
g2. In the speciﬁc examples that we considered, the gn factorize into products involving only
g2’s, but there may be other decompositions. For example, the gn for n ≥3 can be functionals
that only involve ρ and g2.
We will call the two asymptotic properties the decorrelation
principle for disordered packings. This principle as well as other results described in Section
5 leads us to a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings in high
dimensions, which we state in Section 5.1.
An example of constrained spatial correlations that would not vanish asymptotically is
illustrated in Fig. 4, where we show the pair correlation function g2(r) for a three-dimensional
sphere packing near the so-called maximally random jammed state [TTD00, Tor02]. A special
feature of g2(r) for a maximally random jammed packing is a delta-function contribution
at r = 1, which reﬂects the fact that the average kissing number (i.e., average number of
contacting particles per particle) is eﬀectively six for this collectively jammed packing, meaning
that the packing is isostatic [DST05]. A positive average kissing number is required if the
packing is constrained to be jammed and in Rd this means that the average kissing number
is 2d for either collective or strict jamming [DST05]. Isostatic packings are jammed packings
with the minimum number of contacts for a particular jamming category. According to the
Decorrelation Principle, as d tends to inﬁnity, g2 for a maximally random jammed packing

explicitly shown) corresponds to an average kissing number of about six.
would retain this delta-function contribution but the unconstrained spatial correlations beyond
r = 1 would vanish. Of course, the manner in which the g2 shown in Fig. 4 approaches the
asymptotic limit of a step function Θ(r −1) plus a delta-function contribution at r = 1 is
crucial. We note that maximally random jammed packings contain about 2–3% rattler spheres,
i.e., spheres trapped in a cage of jammed neighbors but free to move within the cage.

New Approach to Lower Bounds
The salient ideas behind our new approach to the derivation of lower bounds on φmax were
actually laid out in our earlier work [TS02]. The main objective of that work was to study
sphere packings in three dimensions in which long-range order was suppressed and short-
range order was controlled (i.e., disordered sphere packings in ℜ3) using so-called g2-invariant
processes. A g2-invariant process is one in which a given nonnegative pair correlation g2(r)
function remains invariant for all r over the range of densities
0 ≤φ ≤φ∗.
(61)
The terminal density φ∗is the maximum achievable density for the g2-invariant process subject
to satisfaction of the structure factor S(k) inequality (31). A ﬁve-parameter test family of
24

g2’s had been considered, which incorporated the known features of core exclusion, contact
pairs, and damped oscillatory short-range order beyond contact. The problem of ﬁnding the
maximal packing fraction φ∗was posed as an optimization problem: maximize φ over the set
of parameters subject to the constraints (30) and (31). We noted in passing that when the
damped-oscillatory contribution to g2 was set equal to zero, the optimization problem could
be solved analytically for all space dimensions, leading to a terminal density φ∗= (d+2)/2d+1.
Under the assumption that such a g2 was a realizable packing, we also observed that this φ∗
was a lower bound on the maximal density for any sphere packing [i.e., φmax ≥(d + 2)/2d+1]
because the terminal density would have been higher by including the damped-oscillatory
contribution to g2. This conjectural lower bound was noted to provide linear improvement
over Minkowski’s lower bound, but we were not aware of Ball’s similar lower bound [Bal92]
at the time. Since our original 2002 paper, we also learned about other necessary conditions
for the realizability of a point process for a given number density ρ and g2, such as Yamada’s
condition (32). In any event, our brief remarks about lower bounds on sphere packings were
not intended to be mathematically rigorous.
It is our intent here to make our optimization methodology to obtain lower bounds on φmax
more mathematically precise, especially in light of recent developments and the considerations
of the previous two sections. We then apply the optimization procedure to provide alternative
derivations of previous lower bounds as well as a new bound.
We will consider those “test” g2(r)’s that are distributions on Rd depending only on the
radial distance r such that h(r) = g2(r) −1. For any test g2(r), we want to maximize the
corresponding density φ satisfying the following three conditions:
(i)
g2(r) ≥0
for all
r,
(ii)
supp(g2) ⊆{r : r ≥1},
(iii)
S(k) = 1 + ρ (2π)
d
2
Z ∞
0
rd−1[g2(r) −1]J(d/2)−1(kr)
(kr)(d/2)−1 dr ≥0
for all
k.
We will call the maximum density the terminal density and denote it by φ∗.
Remarks:
1. The conditions (i)–(iii) are just recapitulations of (25), (30), and (31) for this class of test
functions. We will call condition (ii) the hard-core constraint.
2. When there exist sphere packings with g2 satisfying conditions (i)–(iii) for φ in the interval
25

[0, φ∗], then we have the lower bound on the maximal density given by
φmax ≥φ∗.
(62)
The best lower bound would be obtained if one could probe the entire class of test functions.
In practice, we will consider here only a small subset of test functions and in particular those
that are amenable to exact asymptotic analysis. In some instances, we will associate with the
terminal density φ∗an optimized average kissing number Z∗. Thus, whenever inequality (62)
applies, the maximal kissing number Zmax is bounded from below by Z∗, i.e.,
Zmax ≥Z∗.
(63)
In the next subsection, we put forth a conjecture that states when the conditions (i)–(iii) are
necessary and suﬃcient for the existence of disordered sphere packings.
3. Remarkably, the optimization problem deﬁned above is identical to one formulated by Cohn
[Coh02]. In particular, it is the dual of the primal inﬁnite-dimensional linear program that
Cohn employed with Elkies [CE03] to obtain upper bounds on the maximal packing density.
One need only replace S(k) with ˆg −cδ(k), where c plays the role of number density, g is a
tempered distribution and ˆg is its Fourier transform in Cohn’s notation. Thus, even if there
does not exist a sphere packing with g2 satisfying conditions (i)–(iii), our formulation has
implications for upper bounds on φmax, which we discuss in Section 6. For ﬁnite-dimensional
linear programs (and many inﬁnite-dimensional ones) there is no “duality gap,” i.e., the optima
of the primal and dual programs are equal. However, in this inﬁnite-dimensional setting, it
is not clear how to prove that there is no duality gap [Coh02]. Therefore, it is rigorously
true that the terminal density φ∗can never exceed the Cohn-Elkies upper bound, which is a
desirable feature of our formulation, otherwise the terminal density could never correspond to
a rigorous lower bound.
We will show that for the test radial distribution functions considered in this paper, the
Yamada condition (32) is only relevant in one dimension, and even then in just some cases.
A remark about the Yamada condition for sphere packings is in order here. In earlier work
[TS03], we observed that for any sphere packing of congruent spheres, the number variance
for a spherical window of radius R deﬁned by (33) obeys the lower bound
σ2(R) ≥2dφRdh
1 −2dφRdi
(64)
for any R. This is a tight bound for suﬃciently small R and is exact for R ≤1/2. However,
we note here that provided that 2dφRd ≤1, the Yamada lower bound (32) and lower bound
26

(64) are identical. Thus, the Yamada lower bound for any sphere packing only needs to be
checked for R > R0, where
R0 =
1
2φ1/d.
(65)
5.1
Existence of Disordered Packings in High Dimensions
We have seen that a necessary condition for the existence of a translationally invariant point
process with a speciﬁed positive ρ and nonnegative g2 is that S(k) is nonnegative [cf. (31)].
In other words, given ρ and g2, it does not mean that there are some higher-order functions
g3, g4, . . . for which these one- and two-point correlation functions hold.
The function g2
speciﬁes how frequently pair distances of a given length occur statistically in Rd. The third-
order function g3 reveals how these pair separations are linked into triangles. This additional
information generally cannot be inferred from the knowledge of ρ and g2 alone, however.
The fourth-order function g4 controls the assembly of triangles into tetrahedra (and is the
lowest-order correlation function that is sensitive to chirality) but g4 cannot be determined
by only knowing ρ, g2 and g3. In general, gn for any n ≥3 is not completely determined from
a knowledge of the lower-order correlations functions alone. This is to be contrasted with
general stochastic processes in which nonnegativity of ﬁrst- and second-order statistics (mean
and autocovariance) are necessary and suﬃcient to establish existence because one can always
ﬁnd a Gaussian process with such given ﬁrst- and second-order statistics. For a Gaussian
process, ﬁrst- and second-order statistics determine all of the high-order statistics.
There are a number of results that suggest it is reasonable to conclude that the gener-
ally necessary nonnegativity conditions for the existence of a disordered sphere packing be-
come necessary and suﬃcient for suﬃciently large d. First, the decorrelation principle of the
previous section states that unconstrained correlations in disordered sphere packings vanish
asymptotically in high dimensions and that the gn for any n ≥3 can be inferred entirely from
a knowledge of ρ and g2. Second, as we noted in Section 4, the necessary Yamada condition
appears to only have relevance in very low dimensions. Third, we will demonstrate below that
other new necessary conditions also seem to be germane only in very low dimensions. Fourth,
we will describe numerical constructions of conﬁgurations of disordered sphere packings on the
torus corresponding to certain test radial distributions functions in low dimensions for den-
sities up to the terminal density. Finally, we will show that certain test radial distributions
functions recover the asymptotic forms of known rigorous bounds. In light of these results,
we propose the following conjecture:
27

Conjecture 5.1 For suﬃciently large d, a hard-core nonnegative tempered distribution g2(r)
that satisﬁes g2(r) = 1 + O(|r|−d−ε) for some ε > 0 is a pair correlation function of a
translationally invariant disordered sphere packing in Rd at number density ρ if and only
if S(k) ≡1 + ρ˜h(k) ≥0. The maximum achievable density is the terminal density φ∗.
Remarks:
1. A weaker form of this conjecture would replace the phrase “for suﬃciently large d” with
“in the limit d →∞.”
2. Employing the aforementioned optimization procedure with a certain test function g2 and
this conjecture, we obtain in what follows conjectural lower bounds that yield the long-sought
asymptotic exponential improvement on Minkowski’s bound. Before obtaining this result, we
ﬁrst apply the procedure to two simpler test functions that we examined in the past.
5.2
Step Function
The simplest possible choice for a radial distribution function corresponding to a disordered
packing is the following unit step function:
g2(r) = Θ(r −1).
(66)
This states that all pair distances beyond the hard-core diameter are equally probable, i.e.,
spatial correlations vanish identically. The corresponding structure factor [cf. condition (iii)]
for this test function in any dimension d is given by [TS02]
S(k) = 1 −φ23νΓ(1 + ν)
kν
Jν(k),
(67)
where ν = d/2. Since there are no parameters to be optimized here, the terminal density φ∗is
readily obtained by determining the highest density for which the condition (31) is satisﬁed,
yielding
φ∗= 1
2d.
(68)
Now we show that the Yamada condition (32) is satisﬁed in any dimension for 0 ≤φ ≤
2−d. Consider the more general class of radial distribution functions:
0 ≤g2(r) ≤1
for
r > 1.
(69)
28

The test function (66) belongs to this class. Note that for any dimension, the scaled intersec-
tion volume given by (37) obeys the inequality
α2(r; R) ≤1 −r
2R
for
0 ≤r ≤2R,
(70)
where the equality applies when d = 1. For g2(r) satisfying (69), relation (33) and inequality
(70) yield the following lower bound for any d:
σ2(R) ≥2dφRd

1 + d2dφ
Z 2R
0
rd−1h(r)
h
1 −r
2R
i
dr

.
(71)
At φ = 1/2d, the lower bound (71) for the test function (66) is given by
σ2(R) ≥
d
2(d + 1)Rd−1
(72)
and because R0 = 1 [cf. (65)], we only need to consider R > 1. In particular, the right side of
this inequality is smallest at R = 1 so that
σ2(R) ≥
d
2(d + 1).
(73)
Since σ2(R) ≥1/4 for d ≥1, Yamada’s condition is satisﬁed for all R for the step function
(66) at φ = 1/2d as well as all φ < 1/2d.
We already established in Section 4 that there exist sphere packings that asymptotically
have radial distribution functions given by the simple unit step function (66) for φ ≤2−d.
Nonetheless, invoking Conjecture 5.1 and terminal density speciﬁed by (68) implies the asymp-
totic lower bound on the maximal density is given by
φmax ≥1
2d,
(74)
which provides an alternate derivation of the elementary bound (7).
Using numerical simulations with a ﬁnite but large number of spheres on the torus, we
have been able to construct particle conﬁgurations in which the radial distribution function
(sampled at discretized pair distances) is given by the test function (66) in one, two and
three dimensions for densities up to the terminal density [CTS03, OST06]. The existence
of such a discrete approximation to (66) of course is not conclusive proof of the existence
of such packings in low dimensions, but they are suggestive that the standard nonnegativity
conditions may be suﬃcient to establish existence in this case for densities up to φ∗.
29

5.3
Step Plus Delta Function
An important feature of any dense packing is that the particles form contacts with one another.
Ideally, one would like to enforce strict jamming (see Introduction). The probability that a
pair of particles form such contacts at the pair distance r = 1 for the test function (66) is
strictly zero. Accordingly, let us now consider the test radial distribution function given by
the previous test function plus a delta-function contribution as follows:
g2(r) = Θ(r −1) +
Z
s1(1)ρδ(r −1).
(75)
Here s1(r) is the surface area of a d-dimensional sphere of radius r given by (24) and Z is a
parameter, which is the average kissing number. Because we allow for interparticle contacts
via the second term in (75), the terminal density is expected to be greater than 2−d, which
will indeed be the case. The corresponding structure factor [cf. (iii)] for this test function in
any dimension d is given by [TS02]
S(k) = 1 −φ23νΓ(1 + ν)
kν
Jν(k) + Z2νΓ(1 + ν)
dkν−1
Jν−1(k),
(76)
where ν = d/2. The structure factor for small k can be expanded in a MacLaurin series as
follows:
S(k) = 1 + (Z −2dφ) +
 2d−2φ
1 + d/2 −Z
2d

k2 + O(k4).
(77)
The last term changes sign if Z increases past 2dφd/(d + 2). At this crossover point,
S(k) = 1 −2d+1
d + 2φ + O(k4)
(78)
Under the constraint that the minimum of S(k) occurs at k = 0, then we have the exact
results
φ∗= d + 2
2d+1 ,
Z∗= d
2.
(79)
We see that at the terminal density, the average kissing number Z∗= d/2, which does not
even meet the local jamming criterion described in the Introduction.
The Yamada condition (32) is violated only for d = 1 for the test function (75) at the
terminal density speciﬁed by (79). It is easy to verify directly that the Yamada condition
becomes less restrictive as the dimension increases from d = 2. Interestingly, we have also
shown via numerical simulations that there exist sphere packings possessing radial distribution
functions given by the test function (75) (in the discrete approximation) in two and three
dimensions for densities up to the terminal density [OST06]. This is suggestive that Conjecture
5.1 for this test function may in fact be stronger than is required.
30

In the high-dimensional limit, we invoke Conjecture 5.1 and the terminal density given
by (79), yielding the conjectural lower bound
φmax ≥d + 2
2d+1 .
(80)
This lower bound provides the same type of linear improvement over Minkowski’s lower bound
as does Ball’s lower bound [Bal92].
5.4
Step Plus Delta Function with a Gap
The previous test function (75) provided an optimal average kissing number Z∗= d/2 that did
not even meet the local jamming criterion. Experience with disordered jammed packings in low
dimensions reveals that the kissing number as well as the density can be substantially increased
if there is there is a low probability of ﬁnding noncontacting particles from a typical particle at
radial distances just larger than the nearest-neighbor distance. This small-distance negative
correlation is clearly manifested in the graph of g2(r) for the three-dimensional maximally
random jammed packing (Figure 4) for values of r approximately between 1.1 and 1.5. We
would like to idealize this small-distance negative correlation in such a way that it is amenable
to exact asymptotic analysis. Accordingly, we consider a test radial distribution function that
is similar to the previous one [cf. (75)] but one in which there is a gap between the location
of the unit step function and the delta function at ﬁnite d, i.e.,
g2(r) = Θ(r −σ) +
Z
s1(1)ρδ(r −1).
(81)
The expression contains two adjustable parameters, σ ≥1 and Z, which must obviously be
constrained to be nonnegative.
According to the decorrelation principle of Section 4, the
location of the step function r = σ must approach unity asymptotically, i.e., it must approach
the previous test function (75). However, as we have emphasized, the manner in which the test
function (81) approaches (75) is crucial. Indeed, we will see that the presence of a gap between
the unit step function and delta function will indeed lead asymptotically to substantially higher
terminal densities.
The structure factor is given by
S(k) = 1 −23νφσdΓ(1 + ν)
(kσ)ν
Jν(kσ) + 2νZΓ(1 + ν)
dkν−1
Jν−1(k).
(82)
The goal now is to ﬁnd the optimal values of the the adjustable nonnegative parameters Z and
σ that maximize the density φ subject to the constraint (iii). This search in two-dimensional
31

parameter space can be reduced by imposing the further condition that a minimum of the
structure factor occurs at k = 0. The MacLaurin expansion of expression (82) gives
S = 1 + [Z −(2σ)dφ] +
2d−1σd+2φ
d + 2
−Z
2d

k2 + O(k4).
(83)
Requiring that a zero of S(k) occurs at the origin (hyperuniformity) such that the quadratic
coeﬃcient is nonnegative implies the restrictions
Z = (2σ)dφ −1
(84)
and
(2σ)dφ[dσ2 −(d + 2)] + d + 2 ≥0.
(85)
Combination of (82) and (84) yields the structure factor as
S(k) = 1 −c1(d)Jν(kσ)
(kσ)ν + c2(d)Jν−1(k)
(kσ)ν−1,
(86)
where the d-dependent coeﬃcients c1(d) and c2(d) are given by
c1(d) = φσd23νΓ(1 + ν)
(87)
c2(d) = [(2σ)dφ −1]2ν Γ(1 + ν)
d
.
(88)
Now the problem reduces to ﬁnding the optimal value of the parameter σ(d) as a function of
the space dimension d that maximizes the density φ subject to the constraint (iii). It will be
shown below that the optimal σ is of order unity and approaches unity in the limit d →∞. It
immediately follows from (86) and the asymptotic properties of the Bessel functions of ﬁxed
order that S(k) →1 for k →∞.
In general, S(k) will possess multiple minima and thus we want to ensure that the values
of S(k) at each of these minima are all nonnegative. To ﬁnd the minima of S(k), we set its
ﬁrst derivative to zero, yielding the relation
c1(d)
σν−1 Jν+1(kσ) = c2(d)kJν(k),
(89)
where we have used the identity

(90)
For suﬃciently small d (d ≤200), the search procedure is carried out numerically using
Maple, and is made more eﬃcient by exploiting the fact that the minima of S(k) occur at

Figure 5 shows the optimized structure factor for d = 12 and
d = 24. Our numerical examination of S(k) for a wide range of d values has consistently
shown that the ﬁrst minimum for positive k is the deepest one. Although we have not proven
this rigorously, we assume that this is a general result.
We should note that the Yamada condition (32) is violated only for d = 1 for the test
function (81) for the terminal density φ∗and associated optimized parameters σ∗and Z∗
[calculated via (84)]. One can again verify directly that the Yamada condition becomes less
restrictive as the dimension increases from d = 2. However, although the test function (81)
for d = 2 with optimized parameters φ∗= 0.74803, σ∗= 1.2946 and Z∗= 4.0148 satisﬁes the
Yamada condition, it cannot correspond to a sphere packing because it violates local geometric
constraints speciﬁed by σ∗and Z∗. Speciﬁcally, for an average kissing number of 4.0148, there
must be particles that are in contact with at least ﬁve others. But no arrangement of the ﬁve
exists which is consistent with the assumed pair correlation function (step plus delta function
with a gap from 1 to 1.2946). Simple geometric considerations show that either some pairs
of the ﬁve would be forced into the gap, or they would be restricted to ﬁxed separations that
would correspond to undesired delta functions beyond the gap. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst example of a test radial distribution function that satisﬁes the two standard non-
negativity conditions (30) and (31) and the Yamada condition (32), but cannot correspond to
a point process. Thus, there is at least one previously unarticulated necessary condition that
has been violated in the low dimension d = 2.
In three dimensions one obtains φ∗= 0.5758254, σ∗= 1.246997, and Z∗= 7.932582.
The last of these requires that some nonzero fraction of the spheres must have at least 8
contacting neighbors. We have veriﬁed that valid arrangements of both 8 and 9 contacts are
possible, thereby avoiding the analog of the violation encountered in d = 2. As is the case

with the Yamada condition (32), this additional necessary condition appears to lose relevance
as d increases.
The terminal density φ∗and the associated optimized parameters σ∗and Z∗are listed
in Table 3 for selected values of the space dimension between d = 3 and d = 200. Note that
for d ≤56, the terminal density lies below the density of the densest known packing. For
d = 56, the densest arrangement is a lattice (designated by L56,2(M) [Neb98]) with density
φ = 2.327670 × 10−11, which is about twice as large as φ∗, as shown in the table. However,
for d > 56, φ∗can be larger than the density of the densest known arrangement. For d = 60,
the densest known packing is again a lattice (designated by L56,2(M) [CS98]) with density
φ = 2.966747 × 10−13, which is about ﬁve times smaller than φ∗, as shown in the table. The
next dimension for which data is available is d = 64, where the densest known packing is the
Ne64 lattice [Neb98] with density φ = 1.326615 × 10−12, which is about six times larger than
φ∗. The table also reveals exponential improvement of the terminal density φ∗over the one
for the gapless case, i.e., φ∗= (d + 2)/2d+1. The crucial question is whether such exponential
improvement persists in the high-dimensional limit.
34

To obtain an asymptotic expression for φ∗for large d, we use the fact that (2σ)dφ ≫1,
implying that c1(d)/c2(d) →d [cf. (87) and (88)]. Therefore, the minima of S(k) for large d
are the solutions of
Jν+1(kσ)
σν−1
= k
dJν(k).
(91)
We see that the locations of the minima depend only on σ (not on φ). The deepest minimum
of S(k), after the one at k = 0, is a zero and occurs at the wavenumber k = kmin. [This
characteristic is true in any dimension (see Figure 5).] Therefore, S(k = kmin) = 0, c2(d) =
c1(d)/d, and relation (82) gives the condition

We ﬁnd the solutions of (91) by linearizing each Bessel function in (91) around its respec-

and x0 and y0 denote the locations of the ﬁrst positive zeros of Jν(z) and Jν+1(z), respectively.
Similarly, we employ the linearized form
xJν(x) = x0β1(x0)(x −x0) + O
 (x −x0)2

(99)
Use of these relations in (91) yields the following equation for kmin:
kmin ≃x0 −

This formula provides an excellent approximation for kmin. For example, for d = 200 (or
ν = 100), substitution of the exact values x0 = 108.8361659, y0 = 109.8640469 and β1/β2 =
1.003189733 as well as the numerical search solution σ∗= 1.008510 into this formula predicts
kmin = 108.4368917. This value is to be compared to the numerical search solution of kmin =
108.4395. This supports the fact that the higher-order terms in the aforementioned linearized
forms of the Bessel functions are negligibly small. Indeed, we expect that this can be rigorously
proved, but we shall not do so here. We will assume the validity of the linearized forms in the
asymptotics displayed below.
For large d = 2ν, we make use of the asymptotic formulas

For d = 200, this
asymptotic formula [together with the constants speciﬁed by (105), (106), (111), 114), (A-5)
and (A-19)] predicts φ∗= 5.626727001×10−44, which is in good agreement with the numerical
search solution of φ∗= 5.667098×10−44. Note also that the formula (94) with kmin estimated
from (100) yields φ∗= 5.666392126 × 10−44, which is remarkably close to the numerical
solution. For large d, result (115) yields the following dominant asymptotic formula for the
conjectural lower bound on φmax:
φmax ≥φ∗∼

√π 2[3−log2(e)]d/2 = 3.276100896 d1/6

(116)
This putatively provides the long-sought exponential improvement on Minkowski’s lower
bound. Note that the constant D1 = 0.1084878572 appearing in (116) is determined from
the appropriate relation in (111) using the value for q1 given by (105) and the more reﬁned
estimate of C1 given by (A-21).
Substitution of the asymptotic expression (116) into (84) and use of (63) yields a conjec-
tural lower bound on the maximal kissing number
Zmax ≥Z∗∼21/3e2q1d1/6

2[log2(e)−1]d/2 = 40.24850787 d1/6 20.2213475205... d,
(117)
which applies for large d. This result is superior to the best known asymptotic lower bound on
the maximal kissing number of 20.2075...d [Wyn65]. Note that such a disordered packing would
be substantially hyperstatic (the average kissing number is greater than 2d [DST05]) and
therefore would be appreciably diﬀerent from a maximally random jammed packing [TTD00,
Tor02], which is isostatic (see Section 4.3) and hence signﬁcantly smaller in density.

Discussion
Our results have immediate implications for the linear programming bounds of Cohn and
Elkies [CE03], regardless of the validity of Conjecture 5.1. As we noted earlier, our optimiza-
tion procedure is precisely the dual of the their primal linear programming upper bound. The
existence of our test functions (75) and (81) that satisfy the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of
Section 5 for densities up to the terminal density φ∗narrows the duality gap [cf. (79) and
(115)]. In particular, inequality (115) provides the greatest lower bound known for the dual
linear program. Moreover, the existence of the inequalities (80) and (115) proves that linear
programming bounds cannot possibly match the Minkowski lower bound for any dimension d.
38

Finally, this link to the Cohn-Elkies formulation proves that the terminal density φ∗can never
exceed the Cohn-Elkies upper bound, which obviously must be true if the terminal density
corresponds to a rigorous lower bound.
Conjecture 5.1 concerning the existence of disordered sphere packings is plausible for a
number of reasons: (i) the decorrelation principle of Section 4.3; (ii) the necessary Yamada
condition appears to only have relevance in very low dimensions; (iii) other new necessary
conditions described in Section 5.4 also seem to be germane only in very low dimensions; (iv)
there are numerical constructions of conﬁgurations of disordered sphere packings on the torus
corresponding to these test radial distributions functions in low dimensions for densities up to
the terminal density [CTS03, OST06]; and (v) the test radial distributions functions (66) and
(75) recover the asymptotic forms of known rigorous bounds. Concerning the latter point, if
Conjecture 5.1 is false, it is certainly not revealed by the results produced by the test functions
(66) and (75) because the forms of known rigorous results, obtained using completely diﬀerent
techniques, are recovered. If Conjecture 5.1 is false, why would it suddenly be revealed by the
introduction of a gap in the test radial distribution function [cf. (81)] relative to (75)? This
would seem to be unlikely and lends credibility to the conjecture in our view.
Conjecture 5.1, the particular choice (81) and our optimization procedure leads to a lower
bound on the maximal density that improves on the Minkowski bound by an exponential
factor. Our results suggest that the densest packings in suﬃciently high dimensions may be
disordered rather than periodic, implying the existence of disordered classical ground states
for some continuous potentials. A byproduct of our procedure is an associated lower bound
on the maximal kissing number, which is superior to the currently best known result. By
no means is the choice (81) optimal. For example, one may be able to improve our putative
lower bound by allowing the test function to be some positive function smaller than unity for
1 ≤r ≤σ. Of course, it would be desirable to choose test functions that make asymptotic
analysis exactly rather than numerically tractable.
Our putative exponential improvement over Minkowksi’s bound is striking and should
provide some impetus to determine the validity of Conjecture 5.1. As a ﬁrst step in this
direction, it would be fruitful if one could show that for suﬃciently small densities, the two
standard nonnegativity conditions on the pair correlation function g2 are suﬃcient to assure
the existence of a point process, whether it is a sphere packing or not. Another problem
worth pursuing is the demonstration of the existence of a pair interaction potential in Rd
corresponding to a sphere packing for a given ρ and g2 provided that ρ and g2 are suﬃciently
small. Such a proof may be possible following the methods that Koralov [Kor05] used for the
39

lattice setting. It would also be proﬁtable to pursue the construction of disordered sphere
packings with densities that exceed 1/2d for suﬃciently large d.

The function Aν(x) cos[ων(x) −π/4] in (A-1) actually represents the dominant term in the
asymptotic expansion (4) on page 244 of Watson [Wat58] for Jν(x) when ν is large and
x > ν and Aν(x) multiplied by the big-O term represents the largest absolute error when
this dominant term is used to estimate Jν(x). A problem of central concern is an estimate of
Jν(x) in the vicinity of its ﬁrst positive zero x0 when ν is large. The ﬁrst positive zero has
the asymptotic expansion [Olv60]
x0 = ν + a1ν1/3 + a2

Thus, substitution of the values for the constants a1 and a2 into the expressions above yields
the estimates
C1 = −1.104938082,
C2 = 1.627074727.
(A-19)
For d = 200 (ν = 100), for example, the asymptotic expansions (A-13) - (A-15) predict
−0.04778125640, −0.04743934518 and −0.04812316762, respectively.
This is to compared
to the corresponding exact results: −0.04829366129, −0.04799533693 and −0.04859672879.
Note that although the estimates of the constants C1 and C2 given by (A-19) involve a small
error due to our use of only the dominant asymptotic term (A-1), the functional forms of the
asymptotic expansions (A-13) - (A-15) are exact.
We can show that the exact expressions for the constants C1 and C2 appearing in (A-13)
- (A-15) are rapidly converging asymptotic expansions in inverse powers of the constant a1
appearing in (A-4). For example, using expansion (4) on page 244 of Watson, we ﬁnd that
the ﬁrst three terms of the expansion of C1 is given by
C1 = C11

The ﬁrst term of the expansion (A-20) is the dominant one and is identical to the estimate
given in (A-16). The ﬁrst term of (A-20) is about 66 times larger than the second term in
absolute value and the second term is about 7 times larger than the third term in absolute
value. Substitution of the constant a1 into (A-20) yields the more reﬁned estimate
C1 = −1.123958144.
(A-21)
This reﬁned estimate diﬀers from the dominant ﬁrst-term estimate given in (A-19) in the third
signiﬁcant ﬁgure. One could continue correcting this estimate by including additional terms
in the asymptotic expansion but this quickly becomes tedious and is not necessary because,
as we show at the end of Section 5, the precise value of C1 is not relevant for the putative
exponential improvement of Minkowski’s lower bound on the density, as speciﬁed by (116).
