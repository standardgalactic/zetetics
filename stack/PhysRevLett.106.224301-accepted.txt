Abstract
We show that thin sheets under boundary conﬁnement spontaneously generate a universal self-
similar hierarchy of wrinkles. From simple geometry arguments and energy scalings, we develop a
formalism based on wrinklons, the transition zone in the merging of two wrinkles, as building-blocks
of the global pattern. Contrary to the case of crumple paper where elastic energy is focused, this
transition is described as smooth in agreement with a recent numerical work [1]. This formalism
is validated from hundreds of nm for graphene sheets to meters for ordinary curtains, which shows
the universality of our description. We ﬁnally describe the eﬀect of an external tension to the
distribution of the wrinkles.

The drive towards miniaturization in technology is demanding for increasingly thinner
components, raising new mechanical challenges [2].
Thin ﬁlms are however unstable to
boundary or substrate-induced compressive loads: moderate compression results in regular
wrinkling [3–7] while further conﬁnement can lead to crumpling [8, 9]. Regions of stress
focusing can be a hindrance, acting as nucleation points for mechanical failure. Conversely,
these deformations can be exploited constructively for tunable thin structures. For example,
singular points of deformation dramatically aﬀect the electronic properties of graphene [10].
Here, we show that thin sheets under boundary conﬁnement spontaneously generate a
universal self-similar hierarchy of wrinkles; from strained suspended graphene to ordinary
hanging curtains. We develop a formalism based on wrinklons, a localized transition zone
in the merging of two wrinkles, as building-blocks to describe these wrinkled patterns.
To illustrate this hierarchical pattern, we show in Fig. 1a wrinkled graphene sheet along
with an ordinary hanged curtain. These patterns are also similar to the self-similar circular
patterns ﬁrst reported by Argon et al. for the blistering of thin ﬁlms adhering on a thick
substrate [11].
The diversity and complexity of those systems, characterized by various
chemical and physical conditions, could suggest, a priori, that the underlying mechanisms
governing the formation of these patterns are unrelated. However, these systems can be
depicted, independently from the details of the experiments, as a thin sheet constrained at
one edge while the others are free to adapt their morphology. These constraints can take the
form of an imposed wavelength at one edge or just the requirement that it should remain
ﬂat.
As illustrated in Fig. 1 and 2, sheets made from various materials constrained at one
edge by an imposed sinusoidal proﬁle spontaneously develop a hierarchical pattern of folds
or wrinkles. At ﬁrst sight, as quoted by numerous authors [9, 11–17], these patterns consist
of a hierarchy of successive generations of folds whose typical size gradually increases along
x (Fig. 1b). We propose to rationalize these various hierarchical patterns by considering the
evolution of the average wavelength, λ, with the distance to the constrained edge, x. This
evolution is adequately described by a simple power law, λ ∼xm, see Fig. 1c, which conﬁrms
the self-similarity of these patterns as hypothesized in previous theoretical studies [9, 12–14].
Interestingly, curtains made of various materials with contrasted properties exhibit similar
exponents. We observe values close to 2/3 for “light” sheets and to 1/2 for “heavy” sheets.
Therefore the exponent m is a robust feature of these folding patterns.

In this work, we describe in terms of simple scaling laws the theoretical arguments de-
veloped in the mathematical studies of the von Karman equation [9, 13, 14, 16] and infer
the properties of the hierarchical patterns. We also compare these results with extensive
experimental data. To the best of our knowledge, the experimental characterization of these
patterns had not been carried out before.
Assuming inextensibility of the sheet along the y direction, the imposed undulation along
this direction exactly compensates for an eﬀective lateral compression of the membrane by
a factor (1 −∆) deﬁned as, (1 −∆) ≡W/W0 = W/
R W
0
q
1 + (∂z/∂y)2 dy, where W0
and W are the curvilinear and projected width of the curtain, respectively, and z(x, y) is
the out-of-plane deformation of the sheet. At any position along the x axis, the function
z(x, y) is typically sinusoidal along y, with an amplitude A(x) and a wavelength λ(x). The
inextensibility hypothesis along the y axis imposes ∆∼(A/λ)2 at the lowest order, where
the lateral compression is assumed to be constant throughout the length of the curtain. The
undulations of the sheet along y are characterized by a curvature κ ≃∂2z/∂y2 whose typical
value, varying along x, is of order κ(x) ∼A/λ2. The corresponding energy per unit area, ub,
for bending the membrane is thus of order ub ∼Eh3 κ2 ∼Eh3∆/λ2, where E is the Young
modulus and h the thickness of the sheet. Since ub is proportional to 1/λ2, the membrane
adopts the largest possible wavelengths, in order to minimize energy.
This tendency to
increase the wavelength, combined with the constraint imposed at the boundaries, is the
source of the observed hierarchical wrinkling pattern.
Inspired by previous models based on successive period-doubling transitions [1, 9, 14], we
consider that the allometric laws mentioned above can be derived by considering that the
global pattern results from the self-assembly of building-blocks which we denote wrinklons. A
single wrinklon corresponds to the localized transition zone needed for merging two wrinkles
of wavelength λ into a larger one of width 2λ. This transition requires a distortion of the
membrane which relaxes over a distance L. In other words, each wrinklon is characterized by
a size, L, which depends on the material properties and on the wavelength λ. To investigate
the properties and behavior of wrinklons, we have performed model experiments using thin
plastic sheets.
The sheets were constrained with sinusoidal clamps: two opposite edges
are constrained by a wavelength λ (amplitude A) and 2λ (amplitude 2A), respectively, see
Fig. 2a,b. The normalized size of the wrinklons, L/λ, is plotted in Fig. 2c as a function of
the normalized amplitude, A/h; the data collapse on a single curve deﬁned by L/λ ∼
q
A/h.
4

This relation implies that L ∝λ3/2 since A ∼λ
√
∆.
In a further step, the wrinklons can be assembled to mimic the behavior of a complete
hierarchy. Indeed, if L is the distance over which the wavelength increases from λ to 2λ,
its variation, dλ/dx, is thus of order λ/L. Hence, the evolution of λ as a function of the
distance from the constrained edge, x, is given by
dλ
dx ≃λ
L.
(1)
Considering the scaling L ∝λ3/2 deduced from the single wrinklon experiments, equation (1)
indicates that the wavelength along the sheet should evolve like λ ∝x2/3. The excellent
agreement between this power law and the experimental data measured for light sheets
(Fig. 1c) provides a strong support to the concept of wrinklons as building-blocks. Equa-
tion (1) can now be regarded as a tool that connects the properties of single wrinklons to
the features of the full wrinkling-cascade pattern.
We now focus on the description of an elementary building block. For conﬁned thin sheets,
stretching deformations are costly as compared to pure bending. The sheet tends to adopt
an isometric (developable) shape [8]. However, the only developable solutions compatible
with boundary conditions generally include ﬂat domains surrounded by edge or point-like
singularities. These singularities, which focus the elastic energy into narrow regions, have
been classiﬁed as developable cones [18, 19], ridges [8, 20], or curved ridges [21]. In our
case, the scenario is however signiﬁcantly diﬀerent: in contrast to crumpling, stretching is
smoothly distributed in the transition zone as pointed out recently in numerical simulations
of deformed membranes [1]. The necessary stretching required for connecting the periodic
patterns can be illustrated by a simple origami model made with a sheet of paper (see supp.
info.). The stretching energy can be estimated through the elongation strain of the sheet
along x within a transition domain. The typical value of the strain along x is of order α2,
where α ∼A/L ∼λ∆1/2/L is the average slope of the membrane. The stretching energy
thus reads Us ∼Eh (α2)2Lλ ∼Eh λ5∆2L−3.
As observed in Figs. 1 and 2, wrinklons should also include a tip singularity (a small
region where Gaussian curvature is large). This singularity can be described as a semi-
circular fold of radius ρ (Fig. 2b). The energy of these singularities has been derived by
Pogorelov [21] in a study of deformed shells. In our context, the energy of such curved
folds reads Ucf ∼Eh5/2 α5/2ρ1/2 ∼Eh5/2 ∆5/4λ7/2L−3, where the radius at the tip of the
5

wrinklon is taken as ρ ∼λ2/L as suggested by the roughly parabolic shape of the crest
of the defect (Fig. 2b). Nevertheless, the ratio of the curved fold energy to the stretching
energy of the wrinklon, Ucf/Us ∼(h/A)3/2, is very small in our experiments : the eﬀect of
this concentrated region can therefore be neglected in the following.
The total energy of a wrinklon, of characteristic area Lλ, is thus given by Utot = Us+Ub ≃
Eh λ5∆2L−3 + Eh3∆Lλ−1. The size of a single wrinklon is ﬁnally obtained by minimizing
Utot with respect to L, yielding
L(λ) ∼∆1/4 λ3/2h−1/2.
(2)
This scaling emerges from a balance between bending and stretching energies and was pre-
viously reported for other situations, such as the decay length of an imposed curvature in a
sheet [20] or the extension of a pinch in a pipe [22]. The scaling for the wavelength describing
the whole hierarchical pattern is obtained by integration of equation (1) with L(λ) given by
equation (2) and is found to be
λ(x)∆1/6

(3)
The scaling law, λ ∝x2/3, is in very good agreement with the observed power laws for light
curtains, e.g. made of fabric or paper sheets (Fig. 1c). In addition to yielding the proper
exponent, this relation enables the comparison of the data obtained from seemingly dis-
parate systems, over a wide range of lengthscales and independently of material properties.
Figure 3a provides a remarkable collapse of the evolutions of the wavelengths measured with
light curtains and various thin plastic sheets.
Heavy curtains, made from fabric or rubber, and constrained graphene bilayers do not
follow this behaviour (instead, they obey λ ∝x1/2). In these experiments, an additional
tensile force is acting on the sheet. This tension, T, is given by the longitudinal tensile strain
induced by thermal manipulation in the case of graphene sheets [6] and by gravity for heavy
curtains (T = ρcgh(H −x) ∼ρcghH, where ρc, g, h, and H are the density of the curtain,
the gravity constant, the thickness and the height of the curtain). These systems can also
be compared to the cascade of wrinkles observed for compressed thin polystyrene ﬁlms on
an air-water interface [15] since the surface tension of water at the free edges pulls the thin
sheet.
The tension exerted along x per unit width, imposes an additional stretching energy
given by Ut ∼T α2 Lλ ∼T∆λ3L−1, and becomes dominant when Ut > Us, that is when
6

T > Eh2∆/A. The total energy of the distorted membrane thus becomes Utot = Ut + Ub.
The length of a wrinklon found from the minimization of Utot is
L(λ) ∼λ2

(4)
Similar relations, reﬂecting a balance between tension and bending energies, were previously
proposed for single wavelength patterns in stretched sheets and heavy curtains [4, 17]. As
expected, the tensile force increases the length of wrinklons for a given wavelength [16]. By
integration of equation (1) with L(λ) given by equation (4), we obtain the corresponding
spatial evolution of the wavelength along a heavy sheet

(5)
This scaling is in excellent agreement with the power laws observed for heavy curtains and
graphene bilayers, (Fig. 1c). The data of various macroscopic curtains, graphene bilayers
and nanometric polystyrene indeed collapse onto a single master curve without any ﬁt-
ting parameters (see Fig. 3b). Our formalism is thus validated from hundreds of nm for
graphene sheets to meters for rubber and fabric curtains, which shows the universality of
our description. The transition between the stretching and tension regimes can be obtained
by comparing the relations (3) and (5). The critical distance from the edge at which this
transition occurs is given by x⋆/h ∼(Eh/T)3/2∆. In gravity dominated systems, the ten-
sion T ≃ρghH, gives the typical curtain length Hc ∼h(E/ρgh)3/5∆2/5 above which tension
dominates. Curtains shorter than Hc (about 1m for our fabric) were used to observe the
regimes dominated by stretching (“light sheets”), whereas the top part of longer curtains
were used for experiments concerning “heavy sheets”.
In summary, we showed that the self-similar patterns observed in sheets constrained at
one edge cannot be described with d-cone or ridges singularities.
In contrast, they can
be built by stitching together building-blocks, called wrinklons characterized by a diﬀuse
stretching energy. The self-similar structure is then related to the size of these wrinklons
that depends on material properties and the local wavelength. Interestingly, we also show
that these building-blocks can be readily manipulated through the size and energy cost of a
single wrinklon by applying a tension. For large values of tension, we even expect a transition
towards a purely cylindrical pattern along the sheet with a single wavelength. Finally, we
can draw a parallel between this study and the previously reported fractal buckling of torn
7

plastic sheets [23]. The imposed metric indeed determines the three-dimensional shape of
the distorted membrane, characterized by a superimposition of various modes. In contrast,
the patterns observed here for constrained thin sheets exhibit a continuous evolution of the
wavelength.
