Turbulent ﬂows above a solid surface are characterised by a hydrodynamic roughness that
represents, for the far velocity ﬁeld, the typical length scale at which momentum mixing
occurs close to the surface. Here, we are theoretically interested in the hydrodynamic
roughness induced by a two-dimensional modulated surface, the elevation proﬁle of
which is decomposed in Fourier modes. We describe the ﬂow for a sinusoidal mode
of given wavelength and amplitude with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations
closed by means of a mixing-length approach that takes into account a possible surface
geometrical roughness as well as the presence of a viscous sublayer. It also incorporates
spatial transient effects at the laminar–turbulent transition. Performing a weekly nonlinear
expansion in the bedform aspect ratio, we predict the effective hydrodynamic roughness
when the surface wavelength is varied and we show that it presents a non-monotonic
behaviour at the laminar–turbulent transition when the surface is hydrodynamically
smooth. Further, with a self-consistent looped calculation, we are able to recover the
smooth–rough transition of a ﬂat surface, for which the hydrodynamic roughness changes
from a regime where it is dominated by the viscous length to another one where it scales
with the surface corrugation. We ﬁnally apply the results to natural patterns resulting from
hydrodynamic instabilities such as those associated with dissolution or sediment transport.
We discuss in particular the aspect ratio selection of dissolution bedforms and roughness
hierarchy in superimposed ripples and dunes.

1. Introduction
The length scale over which mixing occurs in the superﬁcial layer of a turbulent boundary
layer, close to a solid surface, is a key quantity in meteorology and geomorphology.
This length, later deﬁned as the ‘hydrodynamic roughness’, is for example necessary to
account for the effect of relief and vegetation on winds (Bradley 1980; Finnigan 1988;
Raupach 1992; Raupach, Gillette & Leys 1993; Wolfe & Nickling 1993; Marticorena
& Bergametti 1995; Lancaster & Baas 1998; King, Nickling & Gillies 2006; Gillies,
Nickling & King 2007). Remote sensing methods including satellite imagery (Jasinski &
Crago 1999), airborne light detection and ranging (Paul-Limoges et al. 2013), tethersonde
and eddy correlation systems (Tsuang et al. 2003; Tsai et al. 2010), Global Positioning
System radiosondes (Han et al. 2015), European Remote Sensing scattermeter (Prigent
et al. 2005) and terrestrial laser scanning (Nield et al. 2013), have been employed to
evaluate the hydrodynamic roughness and its relation to geometrical asperities of the
ground. In glaciology, these measurements are also used to quantify the turbulent heat
exchange between the surface of glaciers and the atmosphere, and their contribution
to the ice melt (Smeets & Van den Broeke 2008). Similarly, the determination of the
hydrodynamic roughness of the sea surface is important in oceanography to quantify
the exchange of momentum at the air–sea interface (Maat, Kraan & Oost 1991)
and the nucleation of waves (Aulnette, Rabaud & Moisy 2019; Perrard et al. 2019).
As a ﬁnal example, this length scale directly controls the vertical thermal exchange
with the atmosphere in cities (Crago, Okello & Jasinski 2012; Kent, Grimmond &
Gatey 2017).
Some of these applied problems belong to the generic case of a turbulent boundary layer
above a ﬂat rough surface. Since the earliest investigations in the 1930s, including those of
Nikuradse (1933) and Schlichting (1937), it has been found that the velocity proﬁle in such
ﬂows is logarithmic with respect to the distance z to the surface. Following dimensional
analysis (Prandtl 1925; Pope 2000; Schlichting & Gersten 2000), the rate of momentum
mixing in this turbulent layer is determined by the mean velocity gradient, over a length
scale, called the mixing length, ℓ, proportional to the geometrical distance z. For a steady
and homogenous ﬂow over a ﬂat substrate in neutral conditions, the velocity proﬁle away
from the boundary takes the classical form
ux = u∗
κ ln
 z
z0

,
(1.1)
where ux is the time-averaged velocity along the ﬂow direction x; u∗is the friction velocity,
related by u∗= √τxz/ρ to the shear stress τxz and the ﬂuid density ρ; τxz represents the
ﬂux of momentum across surfaces parallel to the solid substrate and is therefore conserved
in the z direction; κ ≈0.4 is the phenomenological von Kármán constant. The length z0
is the altitude at which the logarithmic velocity proﬁle (1.1) seems to vanish above the
ground, when extrapolated, hence appearing as a reference level below which the velocity
becomes very small. It is called the hydraulic roughness in hydraulic engineering (Van
Rijn 1984; Flack & Schultz 2010), the aerodynamic roughness in the case of an air ﬂow and
here is generically named hydrodynamic roughness. The parameter z0 can be interpreted
as a mixing length governing the turbulent ﬂuctuations close to the solid surface. The
physical origin of the hydrodynamic roughness depends on the processes at play close to
the surface. It has for instance been experimentally studied in wind tunnels with discrete
roughness elements placed on a ﬂat substrate (Taylor, Gent & Keen 1976; Schmid & Bünzli
1995; Hobson, Wood & Brown 1999; Sadique et al. 2017). It is modiﬁed when the solid is
covered by slender ﬂexible structures such as plants (De Langre 2008). It can be produced

by turbulence ﬂuctuations themselves, by roughening of the surface of the ocean. Another
example is the case of sediment transport, which can dominate the interaction between
the granular bed surface and the ﬂow, and typically increases the hydrodynamic roughness
(Owen 1964; Raupach 1991; Gillette, Marticorena & Bergametti 1998; Sherman & Farrell
2008; Durán, Claudin & Andreotti 2011).
A situation of interest is that of a turbulent ﬂow over an elevation proﬁle that presents
several nested length scales. This situation of a gentle topography with superimposed
patterns is typically relevant of sedimentary bedforms (Van Rijn 1982, 1984; Elbelrhiti,
Claudin & Andreotti 2005; Venditti, Church & Bennett 2005; Narteau et al. 2009; Nield
et al. 2013; Durán Vinent et al. 2019). A generic example is grains that form sand
ripples, themselves covering the surface of dunes. As shown in ﬁgure 1, sedimentary
bedforms can present up to four interlocking scales: grains, small impact ripples, large
hydrodynamic ripples and dunes. How to account for the fact that the grains control
the hydrodynamic roughness for the ﬂow over the sand ripples, and the ripples that
over the dunes? How to handle such a multi-scale roughness hierarchy? Here, we
consider a two-scale problem, and investigate the hydrodynamic roughness induced by
a large-scale topography whose surface presents a roughness at a much smaller scale.
What is the effect of the inner surface roughness on the outer topography-induced
roughness, far from the surface? What are the separate effects of amplitude and
horizontal length scale of the large-scale elevation proﬁle on the outer hydrodynamic
roughness? Is there a signature of the laminar–turbulent transition on this hydrodynamic
roughness?
The article is organised as follows. In § 2, we perform the weakly nonlinear analysis
of the turbulent ﬂow above a modulated surface using two expansion techniques. We
ﬁrst discuss the smooth–rough transition, and present the turbulent closure used to
relate the Reynolds stresses to the velocity gradient inspired from models developed for

erosion, dissolution and sublimation pattern formation (Charru, Andreotti & Claudin 2013;
Claudin, Durán & Andreotti 2017; Durán Vinent et al. 2019). This closure involves a
mixing length which allows us not only to account for surface geometrical roughness
and viscous sublayer, but also to incorporate transient effects at the laminar–turbulent
transition. The most technical mathematical considerations are gathered in several
appendices. The results are presented in § 3 where we study the outer hydrodynamic
roughness induced by a topography, with an emphasis on the effect of the inner, surface
roughness. We show that a self-consistent looped calculation allows us to recover the
hydrodynamic roughness induced by a rough surface of equivalent grain size d. We then
come back to the questions mentioned in the previous paragraph, compare some of our
ﬁndings with salient results from the literature and address the laminar–turbulent transition
from the point of view of bed roughness. Open problems and perspectives conclude the
manuscript.
2. Hydrodynamic model
2.1. Smooth–rough transition
We consider here a turbulent boundary layer above a solid surface whose elevation
proﬁle presents two well-separated length scales: a large-scale topography whose surface
presents a roughness at a smaller scale. This situation is typically that of sand grains
at the surface of sand ripples, or that of sand ripples at the surface of sand dunes. A
simplifying description is to consider the large-scale topography as smooth, described by
a vertical elevation proﬁle z = Z(x), invariant along the spanwise y-direction and to take
into account the effect of the roughness of the solid surface in the hydrodynamic model
(ﬁgure 1a).
The situation where the topography is ﬂat provides important constraints to calibrate
such a model (ﬁgure 2). When the surface roughness is much smaller than the thickness
of the viscous sublayer ∼ν/u∗, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid, the
hydrodynamic regime is said to be smooth: the logarithmic velocity proﬁle is regularised
by a laminar ﬂow close to the surface (Pope 2000; Schlichting & Gersten 2000). In
this case, the hydrodynamic roughness is consequently found to be controlled by the
viscous length ν/u∗, independent of the amplitude of the solid surface asperities and is
around z0 ∼ν/(7u∗) (Raupach, Antonia & Rajagopalan 1991b; Schlichting & Gersten
2000). In contrast, when the viscous sublayer is thin enough, z0 is rather controlled by
the geometrical roughness of the solid surface and the hydrodynamic regime is said to
be rough. In this context, the reference situation is a granular bed composed of natural
sand grains of size d, which leads to a hydrodynamic roughness z0 = rd in the rough
regime. For a static sand bed of grain size d, the hydrodynamic roughness measured by
extrapolation of the velocity log proﬁle (1.1) in the rough regime gives typical values
in the range r ≃0.03–0.1 (Bagnold 1941; Kamphuis 1974; Schlichting & Gersten 2000;
Andreotti 2004). For an arbitrary rough substrate it has been proposed to deﬁne an
equivalent sand grain such that its hydrodynamic roughness is the same as that of a sand
bed composed of grains of that size (Flack & Schultz 2010; Chung et al. 2021; Kadivar,
Tormey & McGranaghan 2021). This approach assumes that the hydrodynamic roughness
is essentially proportional to the average roughness element height (Fang & Sill 1992).
Here, we will show, however, that the hydrodynamic roughness presents more subtle
dependences on other parameters such as the element spacing density and shape (Wiberg
& Nelson 1992; Dong, Liu & Wang 2002; Xue et al. 2002; Jiménez 2004; Cheng et al.
2007; Brown, Nickling & Gillies 2008).

from the surface (dashed orange line).
2.2. Governing equations and turbulent closure
In a spirit similar to Taylor, Sykes & Mason (1989), we consider that the inner surface
roughness is characterised by an equivalent grain size d. The smooth–rough transition
is controlled by the grain size based Reynolds number Rd = du∗/ν. The velocity u and
pressure p ﬁelds are described by means of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations,
which state
∂iui = 0,
(2.1)
ρui∂iuj = −∂jp + ∂iτij,
(2.2)
where ρ is the ﬂuid density and τij is the Reynolds stress tensor. As a classical mixing
theory for boundary layer ﬂows, we take here a ﬁrst-order closure (Pope 2000) to relate the
stress to the strain rate ˙γij = ∂iuj + ∂jui, which adds microscopic molecular and turbulent
viscosities
τij = ρ(ν + ℓ2| ˙γ |) ˙γij −1
3ρχ2ℓ2| ˙γ |2δij,
(2.3)
where | ˙γ | = (1
2 ˙γij ˙γij)1/2 is the mixing frequency proportional to the modulus of the
strain rate. Here, χ is a phenomenological constant, which is in the range 2–3 (Pope
2000). It has no importance here as only the normal stress difference τxx −τzz matters
in the calculations (Fourrière, Claudin & Andreotti 2010; Claudin et al. 2017). The
parameter ℓis the mixing length, which is the key input of the model. The simplest
expression of the mixing length presenting a smooth–rough transition is ℓ= κ(z + rd),
where the grain-induced roughness rd is added to the geometrical distance to the solid, z.

However, this formula overestimates turbulent mixing in the viscous sublayer in the
smooth hydrodynamical regime. A classical empirical approach is to introduce a factor to
the geometrical length contribution (Van Driest 1956) which exponentially kills turbulent
mixing when the local Reynolds number u∗z/ν is smaller than a transitional value R0
t ≃
25 (Pope 2000). We adopt here an expression introduced and tuned in the context of the
linear stability analysis for sedimentary or dissolution bedforms (Richards 1980; Ayotte,

(2.4)
Here, κ is the von Kármán constant as in (1.1). The parameter s controls the induction
of turbulent ﬂuctuations in the viscous layer upon increasing the surface roughness. Both
r ≃1/30 and s ≃1/3 have been calibrated using measurements of velocity proﬁles over
varied rough walls (Schultz & Flack 2009; Flack & Schultz 2010) (ﬁgure 2b). In the
smooth regime (Rd ≪1), these numbers give a hydrodynamic roughness controlled by
the viscous length: z0 ≃ν/(7u∗). In the rough regime (Rd ≫1), it rather gives z0 ≃d/30.
The model needs to account for the hydrodynamic response of the ﬂow to the
perturbation generated by the surface elevation proﬁle in the van Driest exponential term.
Let us call λ the typical horizontal length scale of this proﬁle – λ will later be the
wavelength of a particular Fourier mode. When λ is small compared with the viscous
sub-layer thickness, the ﬂow perturbation induced by this topography stays conﬁned
to the viscous layer. In contrast, when λ is much larger than ν/u∗, the perturbation
penetrates the outer turbulent zone so that the ﬂow response is turbulent. In the transitional
regime between laminar and turbulent responses, the surface bumps generate turbulent
perturbations that develop downstream, due to an adverse pressure gradient (diverging
mean streamlines). This effectively modulates the thickness of the viscous sub-layer. In the
mixing-length expression (2.4), this translates into a non-constant value of Rt. To describe
these variations, Hanratty (1981) proposed an empirical relaxation equation in which the
viscous sub-layer thickness lags behind the pressure gradient by a distance scaling with
the viscous length. Here, we write it in terms of Rt as
u∗
ν (Rt −R0
t ) + a∂xRt = b R0

∂x(τxx −p).
(2.5)
Both constants a ≃2000 and b ≃35 have been calibrated in Charru et al. (2013) on
measurements of the basal shear stress over a modulated surface (Zilker, Cook & Hanratty
1977; Zilker & Hanratty 1979; Frederick & Hanratty 1988). The predicted amplitude of
the ﬂow response to topography is very sensitive to these values. In the smooth case, this
response presents strong variations for a narrow range of λ, at the transition from a viscous
response to a turbulent response (Claudin et al. 2017). In the rough case, this transitional
regime disappears as the surface roughness destabilises the viscous sub-layer. We will
show that this hydrodynamic ‘anomaly’ associated with the laminar–turbulent transition,
has a signature in the outer hydrodynamic roughness.
2.3. Weakly nonlinear expansion
We consider a solid surface of vertical elevation proﬁle Z(x), which is decomposed in
Fourier modes. The computation of the outer hydrodynamic roughness induced by Z(x)
from the ﬂow response to this topographical perturbation is a nonlinear calculation, as one

needs to compute the correction to the base (uniform) ﬂow. We perform this calculation
below, starting from the base ﬂow and then expanding the governing equations at second
order in amplitude of the Z variations, considering only their inﬂuence on the zero mode,
i.e. on the average ﬂow. Without loss of generality, a single Fourier mode of wavenumber
k = 2π/λ and amplitude ζ can be considered
Z(x) = ζ eikx.
(2.6)
Here, ζ is the amplitude of the surface modulation, and the following perturbation theory
will be developed in powers of kζ assumed small. We use standard notations with complex
numbers for all quantities involved for the linear development in the sake of mathematical
convenience, although only real parts are understood. We introduce the dimensionless
vertical coordinate η = kz, the wavenumber-based Reynolds number R = u∗/kν, the
rescaled equivalent grain diameter ηd = kd = Rd/R and the dimensionless mixing length
Υ = kℓ.
The base state corresponds to a homogenous substrate in the x-direction (ζ = 0). In this
case, the strain rate reduces into ∂zux, and correspondingly (2.2) reduces to ∂zτxz = 0, or
equivalently τxz ≡ρ|u∗|u∗once integrated. The mixing length then simpliﬁes into
Υ = κ(η + rηd)

1 −exp


.
(2.7)
Summing up the turbulent and viscous contributions of the shear stress τxz, (2.3) yields
ρ(ℓ2|∂zux|∂zux + ν∂zux) = ρ|u∗|u∗.
(2.8)
We deﬁne the function U(η) giving the ﬂow velocity proﬁle in the base state as ux ≡u∗U.
Following the above equation, U obeys
Υ 2|U′|U′ + R−1U′ = 1,
or equivalently
U′ = −1 +

(2.9)
where primed quantities denote derivatives with respect to η. This equation is solved with
the boundary condition U(0) = 0 corresponding to the no-slip condition of the ﬂuid at
the solid surface. The viscous sublayer is described by U′ = R in the limit of negligible
Υ 2R2. Figure 2(b) shows a typical velocity proﬁle of a base state, with the characteristic
outer logarithmic dependence in z from which the hydrodynamic roughness z0 is extracted.
Data available in the literature are collected to demonstrate that the predicted velocity
proﬁles by the present model agree well with experimental measurements.
Next, we seek to compute the ﬂow in response to the surface perturbation (2.6) one step
further than in previous papers by Jackson & Hunt (1975), Sykes (1980), Hunt, Leibovich
& Richards (1988), Fourrière et al. (2010) and Claudin et al. (2017). At the linear order,
Fourier modes can be treated independently of each other, and the computation of the
response to a pure sinusoidal proﬁle (2.6) provides the complete ﬁeld. At the next quadratic
order in (kζ)2, the computation rules when taking products for nonlinear contributions
show that these quadratic terms are of two kinds, those in e2ikx and those homogeneous in
x. Here, only the latter, which provide corrections to the base ﬂow, matter. For our purpose,
we consequently write the weakly nonlinear expansion for ux as
ux = u∗[U + (kζ) eikxU1 + (kζ)2U0],
(2.10)
where U1 and U0 are the modal functions respectively for the linear and homogeneous
quadratic responses. The systematic expansion of Navier–Stokes equations and of

the Reynolds-averaged closure around the undisturbed proﬁle U is summarised in
Appendix A. An important point, beside technical details, is that the validity of this
expansion has a limited range of kζ, which is not known in advance. Within the
same expansion framework, different representations of the solution can be built, which
have different ranges of validity (see Appendix B). In general, the elevation proﬁle Z
presents different Fourier modes, and the contributions of these modes at the linear and
homogeneous quadratic orders are additive. Importantly, even if all modes contribute to
build the hydrodynamic roughness, they do not interact. To account for the small-scale
surface corrugations one could have for example considered them as part of the elevation
proﬁle, and worked with two well-separated modes. Here, however, the surface roughness
is encoded in the turbulent mixing length (2.4) by means of two terms expressed with the
equivalent sand grain size d, and it affects the base velocity proﬁle U, the turbulent mixing
at the surface and the homogeneous ﬂow response U0. One could then wonder whether
these two ways are equivalent, and we shall see in the next section that mode coupling is
required to obtain self-consistent results and to recover the smooth–rough transition.
2.4. Self-consistent looped expansion
A simple way of coupling the different modes of the elevation proﬁle is to ensure that the
base ﬂow used for the expansion incorporates the corrections due to the corrugations of
the solid surface at all scales. This is fundamentally different from the introduction of new
terms in the mixing length. In practice, we use the following iterative procedure. For each
mode of given kζ and R, we compute the quadratic correction U0 to the ﬂow induced
by this perturbation using the base ﬂow velocity proﬁle U as described in the previous
paragraph. We deduce the corrected homogeneous velocity proﬁle ˆU = U + (kζ)2U0 and
compute the next correction using ˆU (instead of U) for the new base ﬂow in the weakly
nonlinear expansion described in Appendix A: all convective turbulent mixing terms are
then computed with a velocity proﬁle that accounts for that perturbation. We repeat this
loop until convergence to a ﬁnal proﬁle ˆU which, used in the expansion, leads to the proﬁle
of U0 giving that ˆU. This self-consistent expansion around the disturbed average velocity
proﬁle, is a priori more precise than the non-looped expansion. This approach resembles,
in spirit, implicit (as opposed to explicit) schemes in numerical solvers of differential
equations. The price to pay, however, is this iterative procedure that must be performed
for each value of kζ.
3. Results
We present in this section the results obtained with the above model to compute the
effective hydrodynamic roughness ze induced by the surface elevation proﬁle (2.6). We
start with the standard perturbative calculation, which will allow us to discuss different
regimes and to evidence the signature of the laminar–turbulent transition on ze. With the
looped calculation, we will then show how to match inner and outer roughnesses, with
application to the smooth–rough transition as well as to superimposed bedforms.
3.1. Hydrodynamic roughness from homogeneous quadratic velocity correction
Following (2.10), the homogeneous part of the velocity proﬁle shows that the base state U
is corrected by the quadratic term (kζ)2U0. The modal function U0 associated with this
correction is illustrated in ﬁgure 3(a), for various values of R and Rd. Its vertical proﬁle
tends towards a constant U0 ∼−E far from the surface, approximately for z ≳λ. We can

Figure 3(b) shows the velocity proﬁles in the shifted representation (Appendix B). One
observes that ze indeed increases with kζ. Interestingly, the ratio ze/z0 not only depends
on the amplitude ζ of the surface elevation, but also on R and Rd. We describe and analyse
below the variations of the coefﬁcient E, which encodes the dependence with respect to
these two quantities.
3.2. Roughness coefﬁcient E in the different regimes
The variations of the coefﬁcient E on the parameters R and Rd are illustrated in ﬁgure 4.
For a given Rd, E essentially decreases with kν/u∗= R−1 (panel a), with E systematically
smaller for larger Rd. Below kν/u∗≃10−2, the variations are rather weak (but note
the vertical log scale). Above kν/u∗≃10−1, the curves become straight and steeper,
corresponding to E ∝R, with a collapse at small Rd. When plotted as a function of
kz0, the coefﬁcient E is also generally decreasing, except within an intermediate range
kz0 ≃10−4–10−1, where non-monotonic variations develop, all the larger for smaller Rd
(panel b). Below kz0 ≃10−4, a collapse along a parabolic behaviour is observed. This
non-monotonic behaviour is in fact also noticeable in panel (a), but less visible due to the
vertical log scale. Below, we comment in more detail these different regimes and provide,
when possible, some asymptotic scaling behaviours.
In the viscous regime, the ﬂow perturbation is imbedded in the viscous sub-layer. In
this limit R is small and one can see in ﬁgure 4(a) that this regime starts at kν/u∗≳100,

and c ≃0.
which roughly corresponds to kz0 ≳10−1. Since turbulent ﬂuctuations are not relevant in
this limit, the mixing length vanishes and the shear stress is dominated by the viscous term
τxz ∼ρν∂zux. It follows that all stress modal functions are simply related to the derivatives
of those of the velocity as: St1 ∼R−1U′
1 and St0 ∼R−1U′
0. The nonlinear correction
to the stress St0 can only come from the inertial term in the momentum balance of the
Navier–Stokes equations, which becomes negligible in this limit. As a consequence, U′
0 →
0, so that U0 tends to a constant, whose value can be deduced from the lower boundary
condition. In order to get no slip at the surface, i.e. ux(Z) = 0 at second order in kζ, U0
must compensate the variation of U1: −U0(0) ∼U′
1(0). Relating this derivative to the
stress, we then obtain −U0(0) ∼RSt1(0). A proper derivation of the equations in this
asymptotic regime (see Appendix C) leads to
E = −U0 ∼1
2RA,
(3.2)
where the basal shear coefﬁcients St1(0) = A + iB have been introduced (Fourrière et al.
2010; Claudin et al. 2017). This asymptotic scaling with respect to R is nicely veriﬁed by
the full model (orange line in ﬁgure 4a). Furthermore, all curves collapse in this viscous
limit for the smaller values of Rd. This is consistent with the fact that the in-phase stress
coefﬁcient A →2 in the smooth regime (Benjamin 1959; Charru & Hinch 2000; Charru
et al. 2013), so that one expects that E ≈R, which is indeed what we obtain up to Rd ≃
100.
For larger values of Rd, the curves in ﬁgure 4(a) at large wavenumber decollapse
but remain parallel in this log–log representation. This means that they share the same
dependence ∝R, but with a prefactor that decreases with Rd. Having both small R
and large Rd may appear to be an unphysical limit, as it would correspond to a surface
perturbation at a scale λ smaller than the equivalent roughness size d. However, one
could for example imagine non-geometrical sources of effective surface roughness, such
974 A16-10

Hydrodynamic roughness induced by a multiscale topography
as random jet injection (Park & Choi 1999; Kametani et al. 2015), that could obey this
scale hierarchy. In this case, a simple argument is to keep the scaling E ∼R, but replace
the viscosity involved in the deﬁnition of R by an effective turbulent viscosity νt ∼u∗d,
such that
E ∼u∗
kνt
∼R/Rd.
(3.3)
This decreasing behaviour in 1/Rd at large Rd is nicely veriﬁed by the dashed part of the
curves in ﬁgure 4(a) (inset).
Let us turn now to the fully turbulent regime, typically for kν/u∗≲10−3, corresponding
to kz0 ≲10−4. In this limit, one can infer an expression for E(kz0) estimating U0 at a
typical (dimensionless) height η ∼1, above which its proﬁle becomes constant (ﬁgure 3a).
For that purpose, we shall combine estimations of the shear stress from the momentum
balance (2.2) and from the turbulent closure (2.3).
The momentum balance essentially writes ρu∂xu ∼∂zτ. Because the quadratic response
we are interested in is homogeneous in x, the only way to contribute to the homogeneous
stress correction is U2
1 ∼St0, where we have also used the fact that horizontal and vertical
derivatives both scale as ∂x ∼∂z ∼1/η ∼1. Similarly, the relation between stress and
strain rate (2.3) can be expressed in a scaling way as τ ∼ρℓ2(∇u)2. For the homogeneous
correction in (kζ)2, the left-hand side of this relation is again St0, but we expect for its
right-hand side several contributions from the product of the different factors, combining
their expressions in the base state, at linear order 1 and quadratic homogeneous order 0.
Gathering these contributions, and as detailed in Appendix C, one essentially obtains St0 ∼
U0 + U2
1 + U1 + Cst. Finally, using the relation for the asymptotic expression for the
linear correction of the velocity (Fourrière et al. 2010) U1 ∼(A + iB)/(2κ) ln(η/kz0) ∼
ln(kz0), we ﬁnally obtain for E ∼−U0 at η ∼1
E ≃a ln2 kz0 + b ln kz0 + c.
(3.4)
The coefﬁcients a, b and c are expected to be approximately constant, since they come from
A and B, which are only weakly dependent on kz0 in the turbulent regime (Fourrière et al.
2010; Charru et al. 2013). Their adjustment to the result of the full integrated model gives a
good ﬁt to the data for hydrodynamically rough conditions (ﬁgure 4b), in practice valid on
the entire range of kz0. Although not directly expressed in terms of such a coefﬁcient E, a
similar quadratic behaviour was derived by Jacobs (1989) by means of asymptotic analysis
of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations closed by Launder–Spalding turbulence
model. Taylor et al. (1989) also report linear variations of the equivalent of E with ln kz0
in the range 10−8–10−3, with different turbulent closures.
Finally, at intermediate wavenumbers, one observes a non-monotonic variation of E
with respect to kz0. It signiﬁcantly increases the effective roughness around kz0 ≃10−3.
It is most pronounced when the ﬂow is hydrodynamically smooth and it becomes less
and less signiﬁcant as Rd increases (ﬁgure 4b). This striking behaviour is similar to what
is also observed in the ﬂow linear response for the behaviour of the stress coefﬁcients
A and B (Charru et al. 2013; Claudin et al. 2017), and the pressure coefﬁcients C and D
(Claudin, Louge & Andreotti 2021), when 10−4 ≲kz0 ≲10−2. This ‘anomaly’ takes place
at the transition between a laminar and a turbulent response of the ﬂow to the elevation
proﬁle, discussed above. It is included in the description by the relaxation equation of the
transitional Reynolds number Rt (2.5), associated with this laminar–turbulent transition.
A qualitative picture of this transition is that turbulent bursts are produced at the crest and
develop on the downstream side (Charru et al. 2013), when the disturbance reaches the
size of the viscous boundary layer. This effect shares some similarities with the drag crisis

on a sphere or a circular cylinder (Choi, Jeon & Kim 2008). A deeper understanding of it
is, however, missing and new experiments as well as numerical simulations are deﬁnitively
needed to go further on this fundamental question.
3.3. Matching between inner and outer scales
So far, we have modelled the inner roughness by terms in the mixing length proportional
to the equivalent grain size d. Consider again the case of grains at the surface of sand
ripples superimposed on a large dune. At the largest scale, the sand ripples are the source
of dune-surface roughness. They then could be also treated by a modiﬁed mixing length
with a corresponding equivalent grain size. However, one can zoom on these sand ripples
and consider them as geometrical disturbances to the dune surface, rather than a source
of turbulent mixing. Similarly, zooming on the grains, one expects the roughness they
induce to be an emergent property of their geometrical effect. The model should therefore
be self-consistent when considering the induced roughness from the two perspectives: a
source of turbulent mixing and a geometrical corrugation.
As a ﬁrst test, we consider a ﬂat rough surface whose corrugations are modelled by a
smooth surface of wavelength λ, which will be set by the equivalent grain size d (ﬁgure 5b).
However, to avoid confusion, we will keep the notation λ. Following the perturbative
prediction (3.1) for a smooth surface, the effective hydrodynamic roughness induced by
such an elevation of amplitude ζ reads
ze ≃
ν
7u∗
exp[κ(kζ)2E],
(3.5)
where E is given by the red curve in ﬁgure 4(a) (smooth limit), computed for k = 2π/d.
When plotted as a function of du∗/ν to compare with the data (dashed line in ﬁgure 2(a),
for kζ = 0.88, see below), we see that the agreement is good in the smooth regime, but
starts to diverge from the measurements when the roughness becomes of the order of the
viscous sublayer: zeu∗/ν ≃1. This expansion is thus unable to reproduce the transition
towards the rough regime, and predicts a hydrodynamic roughness signiﬁcantly larger than
that observed: the dependence is exponential rather than linear. The problem lies in the fact
that, when the surface corrugation increases, it induces inertial mixing of momentum that
destroys the viscous sublayer. The smooth base proﬁle with its viscous sublayer is thus not
the relevant uniform state around which the expansion should be performed.
The idea is then to use instead the looped expansion introduced in § 2.4. We start with
the smooth base velocity proﬁle U0, i.e. computed from (2.9) with ηd = 0 in (2.7), choose
a value of kζ and iterate the described procedure until convergence. To avoid numerical
instabilities, we use the numerical trick to approximate at each loop ˆU by the base proﬁle
Ude computed for a non-vanishing de, so that their hydrodynamic roughnesses are the same
(ﬁgure 5a).
We show in ﬁgure 6(a) the effective roughness computed in this self-consistent manner
for various values of kζ, as a function of λu∗/ν. It can be seen that the transition from
smooth to rough regimes is indeed recovered: the roughness changes from zeu∗/ν ≃1/7
to a linear increase with λ. This asymptotic increase is steeper for larger values of kζ.
When compared with the data on rough ﬂat surfaces by setting λ = d, this prediction ﬁts
well the measurements when kζ ≃0.88 (see the red solid curve in ﬁgure 2a). Interestingly,
this value corresponds to the sinusoidal approximation of the surface of a periodic array
of touching grains Z ≃0.14d cos(2πx/d), which gives kζ ≃0.14 × 2π ≃0.88 (red line
in ﬁgure 5b).

Although the direct and self-consistent derivations of the effective hydrodynamic
roughness (dash-dotted and solid red curves in ﬁgure 2a, respectively) are both expansions
at the second order in aspect ratio kζ, their range of validity is rather different. The better
performance of the self-consistent approach is due to the fact that it takes into account the
topography-induced velocity reduction at the scale of λ. Consistently, we can interpret
the observation that the self-consistent derivation predicts a lower ze than the direct
calculation, as accounting for ﬂow recirculations at the scale of the topography reduces
the effective corrugation of the bottom (ﬁgure 5c).

Figure 7. Self-consistent calculation of the effective roughness vs bedform wavelength (a) and the equivalent
grain size vs bedform wavelength (b). These are computed for a perturbation of various surface roughness
Rd encoded by different colours (see legend for the colour code in both panels) and with an aspect ratio
kζ ≃0.25, typically representative of sedimentary dunes. Dashed lines correspond to the moment at which λ
becomes smaller than d.
3.4. Superimposed sedimentary bedforms
The other situation where inner and outer roughnesses must match is that of superimposed
bedforms: the outer roughness of a given level in the scale hierarchy is the inner roughness
of the next one, as we illustrated with grains, ripples and dunes (ﬁgure 1a). For this
purpose, the looped calculation described in § 2.4 must be initiated at some ﬁnite value of
Rd. The resulting curves are displayed in ﬁgure 7 for kζ = 0.25, a typical value for dunes
at equilibrium (aspect ratio of the order of 1/12). Figure 7 shows consistent increasing
trends for larger and rougher bed. The curves start to diverge from the smooth case when
Rd is larger than a few units. In addition, the resulting effective roughness can be further
transformed into the Darcy friction factor (or skin friction) and the hydraulic resistance (or
form drag) of bedforms (Engelund 1977; Zanke, Roland & Wurpts 2022). An empirical
formula for the hydrodynamic roughness of sedimentary bedforms has been proposed by
Van Rijn (1984), which reﬂects the growth of the hydrodynamic roughness from a value
selected by the grain diameter d to a value selected by the bedform wavelength, as the
aspect ratio kζ increases. At small aspect ratio, for kζ ≲0.25, which includes the typical
aspect ratio of sedimentary ripples and dunes, the looped calculation performed here turns
out to be recovering values close to this empirical prediction.
This situation of multi-scaled pattern is particularly relevant in the sub-aquatic case, as
well as for low-pressure – e.g. planetary – gaseous environments, which provide viscous
or transitional conditions (Colombini & Stocchino 2011; Jia, Andreotti & Claudin 2017;
Durán Vinent et al. 2019; Andreotti et al. 2021; Gunn & Jerolmack 2022). We shall
illustrate here how to apply the present results to the emblematic example of Martian dunes
and ripples (ﬁgure 1b,c). The dunes, whose typical length is of the order of a few hundreds
of metres, exhibit large metre-scale ripples on their surface; these ripples themselves
are superimposed with decimetre-scale small ripples (Lapôtre et al. 2016, 2018). A
hydrodynamic-based explanation for the existence of these intermediate bedforms has
been proposed by Durán Vinent et al. (2019), and veriﬁed by Rubanenko et al. (2022):
the anomaly associated with the laminar–turbulent transition creates a forbidden gap in
974 A16-14
https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.795 Published online by Cambridge University Press

Hydrodynamic roughness induced by a multiscale topography
wavelength that stops the coarsening of the most unstable mode. As discussed above, this
anomaly is present in the smooth regime only. Estimating Martian conditions with a grain
size d ≃100 μm, a shear velocity u∗≃0.5 m s−1 and a viscosity ν ≃10−3 m2 s−1, one
obtains Rd ≃0.05, i.e. a hydrodynamically smooth granular bed. The question is then to
evaluate, for the large metre-scale ripples, the hydrodynamic roughness induced by their
superimposed small ripples. Taking, for these small ripples, a wavelength λ ≃0.1 m and
an aspect ratio of the order of 1/20, i.e. kζ ≃0.15, one obtains, with λu∗/ν ≃50, an
effective roughness zeu∗/ν ≃0.2 corresponding to an equivalent sand grain Reynolds
number Rde ≃5. This indicates that the ﬂow over the large ripples is indeed in the
smooth regime, consistently with the hypothesis of Durán Vinent et al. (2019). Now,
taking for these large ripples λ ≃3 m, i.e. λu∗/ν ≃1.5 × 103, and kζ ≃0.25, we see in
ﬁgure 7 (Rd = 5 is between the blue and black lines) an effective roughness zeu∗/ν ≃1.5,
corresponding to an equivalent sand grain Reynolds number Rde ≃55. This means that
the ﬂow over the large dunes should be considered intermediate between smooth and
rough regimes. Importantly, aeolian saltation – and sediment transport in general (Van Rijn
1984) – is known to increase the sediment bed roughness, with z0 of the order of a few d in
the terrestrial case, associated with Bagnold’s focal point (Durán et al. 2011; Valance et al.
2015). In low-pressure (Martian) conditions, no such measurement is available so far, but
we have checked that the above conclusions are unchanged when doing this hierarchical
looped calculation with an initial similar saltation-induced surface roughness.
3.5. Nonlinear size selection of dissolution bedforms
Finally, the self-consistent prediction of the effective roughness induced by a wavy surface
can be used to revisit the argument given by Claudin et al. (2017) for the selection of
the aspect ratio of dissolution patterns. The instability at the origin of these bedforms
is associated with the hydrodynamic anomaly on smooth modulated beds for a narrow
range of wavenumbers around kν/u∗≃10−3. This anomaly, and thus the instability
mechanism, disappears when the bed is rough enough. Because the development of the
bedforms generates an effective roughness, the idea is that they would stop growing when
this threshold in Rd is reached. Here, we can make this argument more quantitative
with the proposed nonlinear calculations. The looped computation of ze equivalently
provides a corresponding equivalent grain size de, which depends on kζ (ﬁgure 6b).
Experimental studies on the development of ice ripples and scallops report equilibrium
shapes with the inverse Reynolds numbers in the range kν/u∗≃8 × 10−4–2 × 10−3, and
aspect ratios 6–8%, i.e. kζ ≃0.19–0.25 (Ashton & Kennedy 1972; Bushuk et al. 2019).
The corresponding induced roughness reads from ﬁgure 6(b) around deu∗/ν ≃50. This
value is nicely consistent with the instability threshold computed for parameters relevant
to the case of ice melting (Claudin et al. 2017).
4. Concluding remarks
Pursuing our goal to describe the hydrodynamic response to a bed perturbation, we have
here gone one step beyond the linear order, and computed the homogeneous correction
to the base ﬂow induced by the topography. This is a quadratic effect in the amplitude of
the bed elevation, thus requiring weakly nonlinear calculations. Three main results can be
emphasised: we quantify how the bed corrugation increases the effective hydrodynamic
roughness; we show that this effect is sensitive to the laminar–turbulent transition; this
model is able to reproduce the smooth–rough transition in a self-consistent manner and

can be applied to multiscale elevation proﬁles where inner and outer roughnesses are
hierarchically nested.
The expression (3.1) shows that the effective roughness ze cannot be simply related to a
single geometrical length (Schlichting & Gersten 2000; Van Rijn 1982; Raupach, Antonia
& Rajagopalan 1991a; Wiberg & Nelson 1992), here the amplitude ζ of the surface
elevation proﬁle. It still depends on the inner roughness of the ﬂat surface z0. Moreover,
it involves a coefﬁcient E that also depends on the wavenumber of the surface proﬁle,
typically decreasing with larger k. Interestingly, it shows a non-monotonic behaviour for
a range of wavenumber. This anomaly is larger for smoother surfaces, and disappears in
the rough limit. Consistently with a similar anomaly for the stress and pressure response
(Claudin et al. 2017, 2021), it can be associated, in the model, with the lag between
the thickness of the viscous sub-layer (parametrised by Rt) and the pressure gradient
(2.5). This anomaly plays a key role in the formation of sedimentary, dissolution or
sublimation bedforms, especially in low-pressure planetary conditions (Durán Vinent
et al. 2019; Bordiec et al. 2020). However, its direct experimental evidence is limited
to a series of measurements by Hanratty and co-workers (Zilker et al. 1977; Frederick &
Hanratty 1988), that involve a dedicated apparatus with electro-kinetic probes to obtain
the basal shear stress response. The present work suggests that the measurement of the
hydrodynamic roughness induced by a sinusoidal smooth bottom, achievable by more
standard and non-intrusive velocimetric techniques, could offer an alternative way to
provide experimental evidence for this anomaly and allow for a better calibration of
the relaxation equation (2.5). Importantly, as larger surface perturbations induce the
smooth to rough transition, the self-consistent calculation of ze shows that the anomaly
disappears when kζ is too large, and the non-monotonic behaviour of the roughness is
effectively observed here typically for kζ ≲0.05. Finally, these results also shed light on
open hydrodynamic topics associated with such transitional shear ﬂows over a solid wall
(Tuckerman, Chantry & Barkley 2020; Gomé, Tuckerman & Barkley 2022).
Numerical simulations provide another way to investigate these questions. In particular,
direct numerical simulation over wavy surfaces, in the spirit of those of Maaß & Schumann
(1996) and De Angelis, Lombardi & Banerjee (1997), would allow one to gain a deeper
understanding of Hanratty’s anomaly. In such simulations, the good control of the imposed
ﬂow as well as the surface properties (wavelength, amplitude, roughness), together
with a scale separation which requires a resolved viscous sub-layer much smaller than
the surface wavelength, itself sufﬁciently smaller than the system size, is deﬁnitively
challenging at relevant values of the Reynolds number, but probably reachable with current
numerical techniques and computer power (Lee & Moser 2015). The understanding and
the description of the interplay between a wavy surface and the associated modulation of
the viscous sublayer then remains an interesting open problem both from numerical and
experimental points of view, with signiﬁcant potential applications for geomorphology and
geophysical ﬂows.

Appendix A. Weakly nonlinear expansion
In this appendix, we provide detailed information on how to perform the weakly
nonlinear expansion. The aim is to derive two sets of closed equations for the linear and
homogeneous quadratic responses, which are then solved with boundary conditions at the
bottom and top of the computing domain.
The weakly nonlinear expansion for ux has been given in (2.10) as follows:
ux = u∗[U + (kζ) eikxU1 + (kζ)2U0],
(A1)
with U1 and U0 being the modal functions, respectively, for the linear and homogeneous
quadratic responses. Herein, standard notations with complex numbers are used for all
quantities involved for the linear development in the sake of mathematical convenience,
although only real parts are understood. However, when computing the nonlinear terms,
one must go back to real notations through the transform f →( f + f ∗)/2, with f ∗being
the complex conjugate of f. In the same way, expansions are respectively performed for the
vertical velocity uz, the shear stress τxz, the normal stress difference τzz −τxx, the vertical
component of the stress p −τzz and the dimensionless mixing length kℓas

Introducing the above expansions into the Navier–Stokes equations (2.1)–(2.2), we
derive the differential equations at linear and homogeneous–quadratic orders on the modal
functions. The linear components yield

thus decouples from the present problem focused on the computation of U0. Furthermore,
the stress functions St0 and Sn0 can be obtained by integration over η, once the linear order
(U1 and W1) is known.
The integration of the two above sets of differential equations (A15)–(A21) requires
boundary conditions at the substrate surface and at inﬁnity. The upper boundary
corresponds to the limit η →∞, in which the vertical ﬂux of momentum vanishes
asymptotically. This means that the corrections to the vertical velocity and to the shear
stress must tend to zero at both orders: (i) W1(∞) = 0 and (ii) St1(∞) = 0, St0(∞) = 0.
In practice, we introduce a ﬁnite height H (or ηH ≡kH), at which we impose a null
vertical velocity and a constant tangential stress −ρu2
∗, so that W1(ηH) = 0 and St1(ηH) =
0, St0(ηH) = 0. Then, we consider the limit H →+∞, i.e. when the results become
independent of H. Both components of the velocity should vanish at the substrate surface,
i.e. for η = kZ. The condition ux(x, kZ) = 0 then yields
U1(0) = −U′(0),
(A22)
U0(0) = −1
4U′′(0) −1
4U′
1(0) −1
4U′∗
1 (0).
(A23)
Similarly, for uz(x, kZ) = 0, we get W1(0) = 0.
The differential equations (A15)–(A18) for the functions associated with the linear
terms are ﬁrst solved by integrating with the corresponding boundary conditions. The
solutions are then used to solve equations (A19)–(A20) for the functions associated with
the homogeneous terms.
Appendix B. Shifted representations and streamfunction
A ‘shifted’ representation of the modal functions is used in some parts of the paper, noted
with an additional tilde. In this study, all ﬁelds are expanded up to the homogeneous second
order in kζ in a non-shifted representation as in (2.10) for the streamwise velocity. For
some of the graphs, we sometimes prefer to present the velocity proﬁles in the shifted
representation as
ux = u∗[U(ξ) + (kζ) eikx ˜U1(ξ) + (kζ)2 ˜U0(ξ)],
(B1)
where ξ = η −kζ eikx. Expanding the functions ˜f(η −kζ eikx) with respect to kζ, one
obtains
˜U0 = U0 + 1
4U′′ + 1
4(U′
1 + U′∗
1 ),
(B2)
where ˜U1 = U1 + U′ has been given in Fourrière et al. (2010). The shifted representations
for the other ﬁelds work in a similar fashion, except that there could be no base proﬁle as
U in the expressions.
To compute the streamlines, we introduce the streamfunction Ψ (x, z). In the shifted
representation, one solution is Ψ =

 z
0 ux dˆz, and this integral is computed between the
surface ˆz = 0 and some vertical distance ˆz = z. Following (B1), one then has
Ψ = u∗

[U(ˆξ) + (kζ) eikx ˜U1(ˆξ) + (kζ)2 ˜U0(ˆξ)] dˆξ.

(B5)
where we have used the boundary conditions U(0) = 0, W1(0) = 0 and U1(0) = −U′(0).
For the streamfunction in the self-consistent expansion analysis (§ 2.4), it should be
noted that in this equation the homogeneous velocity of the base state U in the integration
should be estimated with Rd = 0 as U0, and that the other quantities should be estimated
with Rd = deu∗/ν. Here, for the plots (ﬁgure 5c), only the real part of (B5) is considered.
Appendix C. Asymptotic regimes of the roughness coeﬃcient E
In this appendix, we provide more details in the scaling arguments for the viscous and
turbulent regimes of the roughness coefﬁcient E.
C.1. Viscous regime
In the viscous response limit, the ﬂow is governed by the Stokes equations. At the linear
order in kζ, the corresponding equations on the modal functions are
U′
1 = −iW1 + St1
R−1 ,
(C1)
W′
1 = −iU1,
(C2)
S′
t1 = i(Sn1 + Sd1),
(C3)
S′
n1 = iSt1.
(C4)
At the homogeneous quadratic order, we have
U′
0 = St0
R−1 ,
(C5)
S′
t0 = 0,
(C6)
S′
n0 = 0.
(C7)
Using the boundary condition St0(ηH) = 0, we can deduce from (C6) that St0 = 0. From
(C5), we therefore obtain U′
0 = 0, i.e. U0 is a constant. Considering the no-slip boundary
condition at the surface (A23), we have
U0 = U0(0) = −1
4U′′(0) −1
4U′
1(0) −1
4U′∗
1 (0).
(C8)
In this viscous limit U′ = R, independent of η, and therefore U′′(0) = 0. From (C1), we
deduce
U′
1(0) = St1(0)R,
(C9)
where we have used the condition W1(0) = 0. Considering St1(0) = A + iB, we then have
U0 = −1
4(St1(0) + S∗
t1(0)) = −1
2R A,
(C10)
and thus
E = −U0 = 1
2R A.
(C11)

Hydrodynamic roughness induced by a multiscale topography
C.2. Turbulent regime
In this limit, one can infer an expression for E(kz0) estimating U0 at a typical
(dimensionless) height η ∼1, above which its proﬁle becomes constant (ﬁgure 3a). For
that purpose, we combine estimations of the shear stress from the momentum balance (2.2)
and from the turbulent closure (2.3).
Let us start with (2.3), we can express in this limit as τ ∼ρℓ2(∇u)2. For the
homogeneous correction in (kζ)2, it writes
St0 = Υ 2U′U′
0 + L2
0U′2 + Υ 2U2
1 + Υ 2U′2
1 + Υ L1U′U′
1 + L2
1U′2,
(C12)
where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side comes from the velocity gradient taken at the
quadratic order U0, with all other factors taken in the base state (Υ for the dimensionless
mixing length and U for the dimensionless velocity). The second term is the modulated
mixing length at this order 0, and the base velocity. The other contributions come from
combinations of terms at linear order. A ﬁrst possibility is to take a base mixing length
with velocity horizontal and vertical derivatives. A second possibility is with a modulated
mixing length and (vertical) velocity derivative. A last possibility is to take a modulated
mixing length with a base velocity. One can recognise all these terms in (A9), properly
expressed with complex notations and correct prefactors. We can estimate their scaling
behaviour having in mind that, in this rough turbulent limit, we have: Υ ∼κη, U′ ∼1/Υ ,
L1 ∼κ and L0 →0. Also, we estimate quantities and vertical derivatives at the scale
η ∼1, so that U′ ∼U/η ∼U (and similarly for U1 and U0). This essentially leads to
St0 ∼U0 + U2
1 + U1 + Cst.
