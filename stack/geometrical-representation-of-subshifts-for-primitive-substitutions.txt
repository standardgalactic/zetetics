Abstract. For any primitive substitution whose Perron eigenvalue is a Pisot unit, we
construct a domain exchange that is measurably conjugate to the subshift. Additionally,
we give a condition for the subshift to be a ﬁnite extension of a torus translation. For the
particular case of weakly irreducible Pisot substitutions, we show that the subshift is either
a ﬁnite extension of a torus translation or its eigenvalues are roots of unity. Furthermore, we
provide an algorithm to compute eigenvalues of the subshift associated with any primitive
pseudo-unimodular substitution.

1. Introduction and main results
In the seminal paper [Rauzy], Rauzy constructed a geometrical representation of the
subshift associated with some particular substitution. He constructed a compact subset
of R2 which is called now a Rauzy fractal, and that tiles the plane and gives a measurable
conjugacy between the subshift and a translation on the torus T2. It was generalized later
by many people, such as Arnoux and Ito, see [AI].
For irreducible Pisot unit substitutions, it is conjectured that Rauzy fractals give a
measurable conjugacy between the subshift and a translation on a torus. What is known is
that it gives a ﬁnite extension of a torus translation.
THEOREM 1.1. (Host, unpublished) Let σ be an irreducible Pisot unimodular substitution
over an alphabet of d + 1 letters. Then the uniquely ergodic subshift (σ, S) is a ﬁnite
extension of a translation on the torus Td.
Recently, Durand and Petite gave a very interesting proof of this result in [DP]. Their
starting point is to construct a proper substitution whose subshift is conjugate to the
subshift of the ﬁrst substitution (see Theorem 2.4). However, this construction does not
preserve irreducibility. So they have to deal with reducible substitutions. Moreover, primi-
tive reducible substitutions naturally arise from some dynamical systems (see for example
the 9-letter substitution in [ABB], coming from an interval exchange transformation).
We use the strategy for the proof of Durand and Petite to extend Theorem 1.1 to a
large class of pseudo-unimodular substitutions, that is, substitutions whose product of all
non-zero eigenvalues of the incidence matrix equals ±1.
THEOREM 1.2. Let σ be a proper primitive pseudo-unimodular substitution. Assume that
the Perron eigenvalue of the incidence matrix is a Pisot number β of degree d + 1.
Additionally, assume that every generalized eigenvector for every other eigenvalue of
modulus ≥1 has sum zero. Then, the subshift (σ, S) is a ﬁnite extension of a minimal
translation on the torus Td.
Moreover, we show that the Pisot hypothesis is necessary (see Proposition 8.1). This
theorem, together with Theorem 2.4, permits to check easily that many non-proper
substitutions have a subshift which is a ﬁnite extension of a torus translation. However,
we do not know if the reciprocal of Theorem 1.2 is true. Nevertheless, in the particular
case of weakly irreducible Pisot substitutions (that is, the only eigenvalue of the primitive
incidence matrix of modulus greater that 1 is a Pisot unit, and every eigenvalue of modulus
one is a root of unity), we have the following alternative.

THEOREM 1.3. Let σ be a weakly irreducible Pisot substitution. Then one of the following
is true:
•
eigenvalues of the subshift (σ, S) are roots of unity;
•
the subshift (σ, S) is a ﬁnite extension of a minimal translation of the torus Td, where
d + 1 is the degree of the Pisot number.
Moreover, there is an algorithm to decide in which case we are.
Notice that for unimodular substitutions, the ﬁrst point implies that the subshift is
weakly mixing by Lemma 6.7. We give a geometrical representation of the subshift for
any primitive substitutions whose Perron eigenvalue is a Pisot unit.
THEOREM 1.4. Let σ be a primitive substitution such that the Perron eigenvalue of its
incidence matrix is a unit Pisot number of degree d + 1. Then, the uniquely ergodic
subshift (σ, S) is measurably isomorphic to a domain exchange (R, E, λ), with R ⊆Rd.
In the particular case of irreducible substitutions, this result is due to Durand and Petite.
Notice that this result is similar to [BS, Theorem 6], but in this paper, we give a proof, and
Theorem 2.4 of Durand and Petite permits us to avoid the strong coincidence hypothesis.
The set R is a Rauzy fractal, but potentially for another substitution. This result, together
with Theorem 1.2, gives a generalization of the main theorem in [DP].
We also give a way to compute eigenvalues of the subshift associated with any primitive
pseudo-unimodular substitution.
THEOREM 1.5. Let σ be a primitive proper pseudo-unimodular substitution over an
alphabet A. Then e2iπα is an eigenvalue of (σ, S) if and only if there exists a row vector
w ∈ZA such that for every generalized eigenvector v of Mσ for eigenvalues of modulus
≥1, we have:
•
wv = α if v has sum 1;
•
wv = 0 if v has sum 0.
In this theorem, it is enough to check the condition for any choice of bases of generalized
eigenspaces for eigenvalues of modulus ≥1. Additionally, thanks to the propriﬁcation
algorithm of Durand and Petite (see §7.1), this theorem permits to completely describe
and compute the set of eigenvalues of the subshift for any primitive pseudo-unimodular
substitution. We provide an algorithm and an implementation doing this computation
(see §7). Notice that a different way to compute eigenvalues is given in [FMN].
Note that Theorem 1.5 implies that eigenvalues of (σ, S) are in the form e2iπα with α
in a free Z-module of ﬁnite rank in Q(β), where β > 1 is the Perron eigenvalue of Mσ.
The hypothesis that σ is proper and pseudo-unimodular in Theorem 1.5 are needed only
for the direct implication. Moreover, this hypothesis can be lightened. All we need is the
fact that if e2iπα is an eigenvalue of the subshift, then α(1, . . . , 1)Mn −−−→
n→∞0 mod ZA.
It is the case if there is no non-trivial coboundary and if the initials period is 1 (see [Host]
for more details and see [Mossé]). It is in particular the case if a power of the substitution
is left-proper. Additionally, in Theorem 1.2, the hypothesis that σ is proper can also be

replaced with the hypothesis that a power of σ is left-proper, since it also implies the
strong coincidence property.
1.1. Organization of the paper.
We start in §2 by deﬁnitions and notation. Then, in §3,
we introduce the notion of a generalized Rauzy fractal. It permits to generalize the notion
of a Rauzy fractal to reducible substitutions, with various possible choices of projection.
It will allow to get translations on a torus as a factor of the subshift and also to get domain
exchanges, but with different projections. Section 4 focuses on the particular choice of
projection giving usual Rauzy fractals, for which we get many nice properties. In §5,
we prove Theorem 1.4, by constructing usual Rauzy fractals that permits to get domain
exchanges. In §6, we prove Theorem 1.5. Then in §7, we provide an algorithm to compute
the eigenvalues. In §8, we prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.3. We ﬁnish with §9 by giving
examples.
2. Deﬁnitions and notation
This section aims to give all the deﬁnitions and notation that will be used in the paper.
2.1. Algebraic numbers.
An algebraic number β is a root of a polynomial with rational
coefﬁcients. The smallest unitary polynomial P with rational coefﬁcients such that
P (β) = 0 is called minimal polynomial. The degree of β is the degree of its mini-
mal polynomial. Two different algebraic numbers are conjugate if they have the same
minimal polynomial. An algebraic number β is an algebraic integer if coefﬁcients of its
minimal polynomial are in Z. An algebraic number β is a unit if it is an algebraic integer
such that the constant term of its minimal polynomial is ±1. This is equivalent to saying
that β and 1/β are algebraic integers. A Pisot number is an algebraic integer β > 1 whose
conjugates γ satisfy |γ | < 1.
2.2. Words and worms.
An alphabet is a ﬁnite set. If A is an alphabet, then we denote by
A∗the set of ﬁnite words over A. We denote by |u| the length of a word u. An occurrence
of a word w in a word u is the length |p| of a word p such that u = pws, where s ∈A∗
is a word. We denote by |u|w the number of occurrences of w in u. The abelianization of
a ﬁnite word u ∈A∗is the vector ab(u) = (|u|a)a∈A. For every letter a ∈A, we denote
ea = ab(a). The family (ea)a∈A is the canonical basis of RA.
The set of bi-inﬁnite words over A is AZ. Inﬁnite words over A are elements of AN.
For a (bi-)inﬁnite word u and for every n ∈N, we use the standard notation u[0,n) =
u0u1 . . . un−1. For n < 0, we use the convention ab(u[0,n)) = −ab(u[−n,0)).
The usual metric on AZ is deﬁned for u ̸= v by
d(u, v) = 2−n
where n = max{k ∈N | u[−k,k] = v[−k,k]}.
For this metric, AZ is compact. A subshift (, S) is a compact subset  ⊆AZ which is
invariant under the shift map:
S :
AZ
→
AZ,
(ui)i∈Z
	→
(ui+1)i∈Z.

Geometrical representation of subshifts for primitive substitutions
5
The orbit of a bi-inﬁnite word u ∈AZ is O(u) = {Snu | n ∈Z}. A subshift (, S) is said
to be minimal if every orbit is dense in , and aperiodic if every orbit is inﬁnite.
We deﬁne the worm associated to a bi-inﬁnite word u ∈AZ as
W(u) = {ab(u[0,n)) | n ∈Z}.
We also deﬁne
Wa(u) = {x ∈W(u) | x + ea ∈W(u)}.
The notion of a worm can also be deﬁned for inﬁnite words in an obvious way (see
[Pythéas]).
Properties 2.1
•
For every u ∈AZ, we have W(Su) = W(u) −ab(u0).
•
We have
W(u) =

a∈A
Wa(u) =
 
a∈A
Wa(u) + ea

∪{0},
and these unions are disjoint.
2.3. Matrices and subspaces.
We denote by In ∈Mn(N), or just I when there is no
ambiguity, the identity matrix. A matrix is said to be irreducible if its characteristic
polynomial is irreducible. Let M ∈Mn(N) be a matrix. We say that M is primitive if
there exists n ≥1 such that every coefﬁcient of Mn is strictly positive. We say that M is
pseudo-unimodular if the product of all its non-zero eigenvalues, counting multiplicities,
equals ±1. In particular, unimodular matrices are pseudo-unimodular.
We use the following well-known theorem.
THEOREM 2.2. (Perron–Frobenius) If M ∈Mn(N) is primitive, then M has a simple real
eigenvalue equal to the spectral radius of M. Moreover, the corresponding eigenvector can
be chosen with strictly positive components.
We call this maximal eigenvalue the Perron eigenvalue of M and we call the associated
eigenvector a Perron eigenvector.
We say that v ∈Cn is a generalized eigenvector of M for an eigenvalue β if v is
a non-zero vector in the generalized eigenspace ker((M −βI)k) where k ≥1 is the
algebraic multiplicity of β.
We extend the notion of projector to linear maps that are not endomorphisms. We say
that a linear map V : Rn →Rd is a projection along a subspace F of Rn if ker(V ) = F
and d + dim(F) = n. Such a map is onto.
We have the following lemma.
LEMMA 2.3. Let V : Rn →Rd be a projection along F and let M : Rn →Rn be a linear
map such that M(F) = F. Then there exists a unique linear map N : Rd →Rd such that
NV = V M and we have det(N) = det(M′), where M′ : Rn/F →Rn/F is the quotient
map.

P. Mercat
Proof. The map V gives an isomorphism V ′ : Rn/F →Rd and the map M gives a
map M′ : Rn/F →Rn/F. Then, we can deﬁne N by N = V ′M′(V ′)−1, and it satisﬁes
NV = V M and det(N) = det(M′). The unicity comes from the fact that V is onto: if N
and N′ are two such maps, then (N −N′)V = 0, so N = N′.
We say that a subspace is rational if it admits a basis with coefﬁcients in Q. We say that
a vector v has a totally irrational direction if the coefﬁcients of v are linearly independent
over Q. A projection is totally irrational if it is a projection along a vector with a totally
irrational direction.
2.4. Substitutions.
We say that a morphism σ : A∗→A∗is non-erasing if for every
a ∈A, |σ(a)| ≥1. A substitution over an alphabet A is a non-erasing morphism of A∗.
The incidence matrix of a substitution σ is the matrix Mσ = (|σ(a)|b)(b,a)∈A2. For any
ﬁnite word u ∈A∗, we have the relation ab(σ(u)) = Mσ ab(u). We say that a substitution
is primitive, irreducible, or any property that has a meaning for a matrix, if its incidence
matrix has the corresponding property.
The subshift of a primitive substitution σ is the dynamical system (σ, S), where
σ is the smallest non-empty compact subset of AZ invariant under the substitution and
by the shift map. We denote it by  when there is no ambiguity. It can be shown that
for every primitive substitution σ, the subshift (σ, S) is minimal and uniquely ergodic
(see [Queffélec, §V.2 and Theorem V.13]). We say that the substitution σ is aperiodic
if every orbit in the subshift is inﬁnite. Notice that if a substitution is primitive and
pseudo-unimodular, then it is aperiodic since the Perron eigenvalue is irrational.
For every ﬁnite word v, w ∈A∗, we denote by [v · w] the cylinder of :
[v · w] = {u ∈ | u[0,|w|) = w and u[−|v|,0) = v}.
Additionally, we denote [w] = {u ∈ | u[0,|w|) = w}.
A ﬁxed point of a substitution σ is a bi-inﬁnite word u ∈AZ such that σ(u) = u. A
periodic point of σ is a bi-inﬁnite word u ∈AZ such that there exists n ≥1 such that u is
a ﬁxed point of σ n. We say that a ﬁxed point or a periodic point is admissible if it is an
element of the subshift σ. Every primitive substitution has an admissible periodic point.
We say that a substitution σ is left-proper (respectively right-proper) if there exists a
letter a0 ∈A such that for every a ∈A, σ(a) starts (respectively ends) with letter a0. The
substitution is proper if it is left-proper and right-proper.
The following theorem is due to F. Durand and S. Petite (see [DP, Corollary 9]).
THEOREM 2.4. (Durand–Petite) Let σ be a primitive substitution. Then there exists a
proper primitive substitution ξ such that:
•
(σ, S) is conjugate to (ξ, S);
•
there exists l ≥1 such that the substitution matrices Ml
σ and Mξ have the same
eigenvalues, except perhaps 0 and 1.
Moreover, the proof is effective.
We call a propriﬁcation algorithm an algorithm that inputs a primitive substitution σ
and that outputs a proper substitution ξ as in this theorem. We say that we proprify a

Geometrical representation of subshifts for primitive substitutions
7
substitution σ if we apply to it such an algorithm, and the output substitution is called a
propriﬁcation of σ. See §7.1 for more details about the propriﬁcation algorithm of Durand
and Petite.
We say that a substitution is weakly irreducible Pisot if it is primitive, the Perron
eigenvalue β is a unit Pisot number, and every other eigenvalue of its incidence matrix
is either a conjugate of β, a root of unity, or zero. Note that the class of primitive
pseudo-unimodular substitutions is strictly larger than this (e.g. Example 9.1 and irre-
ducible Salem substitutions).
2.5. Preﬁx–sufﬁx automaton and Dumont–Thomas numeration.
Let σ be a substitution
over an alphabet A. The preﬁx–sufﬁx automaton of σ is an automaton whose states are the
set A, and whose transitions are a
p,s
−→b for every letter a, b ∈A and word p, s ∈A∗such
that σ(a) = pbs. In all of this article, we denote by a
p,s
−→b if and only if σ(a) = pbs, if
there is no ambiguity on what is the substitution σ.
The abelianized preﬁx automaton is the same automaton where we replace transitions
a
p,s
−→b by a
t−→b, where t = ab(p).
For the subshift σ and for every letter a ∈A, we have the relation
[a] =

b
p,s
−→a
S|p|σ([b]).
Additionally, we have a similar relation for worms: for every u ∈, we have
Wa(σ(u)) =

b
t−→a
MσWb(u) + t.
Any word u ∈ can be written uniquely in the form
u = σ n(vn)σ n−1(pn−1) . . . σ(p1)p0 · bs0σ(s1) . . . σ n−1(sn−1)σ n(wn),
for vn a left-inﬁnite word, wn a right-inﬁnite word, and such that we have a path
pn−1,sn−1
−−−−−→
. . .
p0,s0
−−−→b in the preﬁx–sufﬁx automaton. We call a sequence of preﬁxes the sequence
(pn)n∈N = (pn(u))n∈N associated to u. The sequence of abelianized preﬁxes of u ∈ is
deﬁned by tn(u) = ab(pn(u)).
Hence, to any word u ∈, we associate a unique left-inﬁnite path in the preﬁx–sufﬁx
automaton or in the abelianized preﬁx automaton (see [CS, Proposition 3.2]). Notice that
such a path can be considered as a path in a Bratelli diagram of .
2.6. Eigenvalues of a subshift.
We denote by S1 the set of complex numbers of modulus
one. We say that η ∈S1 is an eigenvalue of a subshift (, S) if there exists a continuous
function f :  →S1 called an eigenfunction such that f ◦S = ηf . Notice that for
primitive substitutions, if we allow the eigenfunctions to be only measurable rather than
continuous and the image to be C rather than S1, it does not give more eigenvalues (see
[Host, Theorem 1.4]).
We say that a subshift (, S) is an extension of a translation on a torus Td = Rd/Zd, if
there exists a continuous map f :  →Td and α ∈Td such that f ◦S = f + α. We say
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2023.101 Published online by Cambridge University Press

8
P. Mercat
moreover that this extension is ﬁnite if the cardinality of f −1(x) is ﬁnite for almost every
x ∈Td, for the Lebesgue measure that we denote as λ.
Notice that if 1, α1, . . . , αd ∈R are linearly independent over Q, then the translation
by α = (α1, . . . , αd) on the torus Td is minimal and uniquely ergodic. It implies that an
eigenfunction f is necessarily almost everywhere constant-to-one, but with a constant that
can be inﬁnite if the extension is not ﬁnite.
We say that a subshift (, S) is weakly mixing if its only eigenvalue is 1 and if this
eigenvalue 1 is simple. Notice that if σ is a primitive substitution, then eigenvalues of
(σ, S) are simple since it is uniquely ergodic.
2.7. Domain exchange.
We call a domain exchange a subset R ⊆Rd, with a map E :
R →R almost everywhere deﬁned for the Lebesgue measure λ such that there exists a
ﬁnite number of subsets Ra, a ∈A, such that:
•
R = 
a∈A Ra and the union is Lebesgue disjoint;
•
each Ra is the closure of its interior;
•
the boundary of each Ra has zero Lebesgue measure;
•
for every a ∈A, E|int(Ra) is a translation;
•
λ(R) = λ(E(R)).
We say that a map f : R →Rd, where R ⊂Rd, is a translation by pieces if there exists
a ﬁnite measurable partition R = 
i∈I Ri such that for every i ∈I, the restriction f |Ei is
a translation.
Notice that the map E associated with a domain exchange is a translation by pieces. And
note that a translation by pieces is ﬁnite-to-one.
3. Generalized Rauzy fractals
In this section, we generalize the usual notion of Rauzy fractal. As we will see,
the construction depends on the choice of a projection map. For subshifts associated
to irreducible substitutions, the choice of the projection is obvious, but for primitive
substitutions several choices can be made. One choice gives a domain exchange, and
another one permits to get a translation on a torus as a factor.
PROPOSITION 3.1. Let (, S) be a minimal aperiodic subshift over an alphabet A and
let V : RA →Rd be a linear map. Assume that there exists u ∈ such that V W(u) is
bounded. Then, the map
φ : O(u) →Rd
Snu 	→V ab(u[0,n))
can be extended by continuity to the whole subshift .
Proof. This proposition is a generalization of [AM, Lemma 8.2.5], with a more general
projection map V and with bi-inﬁnite words rather than right-inﬁnite words. However, the
same proof works.
We call the image φ() a Rauzy fractal of . We denote this map by φu,V , and we
will omit u, V, or  when there is no ambiguity.

Geometrical representation of subshifts for primitive substitutions
9
Remark 3.2. With this deﬁnition, a Rauzy fractal is always compact. It is possible to give
a more general deﬁnition that allows unbounded Rauzy fractal as in [Andrieu].
The following proposition gives properties of the map φ.
PROPOSITION 3.3. Under the hypothesis of Proposition 3.1, we have the following.
•
The Rauzy fractal R = φ() is the closure of V W(u).
•
For every v ∈, φ(Sv) = φ(v) + V ab(v0).
•
For every v ∈, φv is well deﬁned and φu −φv is constant.
•
If v and w are two bi-inﬁnite words of  with the same left-inﬁnite or right-inﬁnite
part, then φ(v) = φ(w).
Proof. By continuity of φ, R is the closure of φ(O(u)). Additionally, by construction,
φ(O(u)) = V W(u). Thus, R is the closure of V W(u).
By construction, we have for every n ∈Z, φ(Sn+1u) −φ(Snu) = V ab(un). Since 
is minimal, the orbit of u is dense in , and since φ is continuous, we get that for every
v ∈, φ(Sv) = φ(v) + V ab(v0).
Let v ∈. Then, the set
V W(v) = {V ab(v[0,n)) | n ∈Z} = {φu(Snv) −φu(v) | n ∈Z}
is bounded, so φv is well deﬁned. Additionally, for every n ∈Z, we have φu(Snv) −
φv(Snv) = φu(v) + V ab(v[0,n)) −V ab(v[0,n)) = φu(v). By density of the orbit of v and
by continuity, we get that φu −φv is constant to φu(v).
If u and v are two elements of  having their right-inﬁnite parts in common, then the
proof of Proposition 3.1 shows that φ(u) = φ(v). If it is the left-inﬁnite parts that u and
v have in common, then we come back to the previous case by symmetry, looking at the
mirror of the words.
The following proposition permits us to show that the Rauzy fractal is well deﬁned
for the subshift of a substitution, as soon as the projection and the incidence matrix are
compatible.
LEMMA 3.4. Let σ be a primitive and aperiodic substitution over an alphabet A, and let u
be an admissible ﬁxed point of σ. If V : RA →Rd is a linear map such that 
n∈N ∥V Mn
σ∥
converges, then the hypothesis of Proposition 3.1 is satisﬁed and φu,V ,σ : σ →Rd is
well deﬁned. Moreover, for every v ∈, we have the equality
φu,V ,(v) =
∞

n=0
V Mntn(v),
where tn(v) = ab(pn(v)) is deﬁned in §2.5.
Proof. The subshift (σ, S) is minimal since σ is primitive. We have φV (O(u)) =
{V ab(u[0,n)) | n ∈Z}. The positive part is described by
{V ab(u[0,n)) | n ∈N} =

N

Since tn are in a ﬁnite set (abelianizations of preﬁxes of σ(a), a ∈A) and since

n∈N ∥V Mn∥converges, we get that the set is bounded. The negative part can
be described in the same way and is also bounded. Thus, V W(v) is bounded, so
φV : σ →Rd is a well-deﬁned continuous map.
To prove the last equality, note that the sum f = ∞
n=0 V Mntn deﬁnes a continuous
map f :  →Rd since every tn :  →RA is continuous and since the series is normally
convergent. Hence, it is enough to check the equality on the dense subset {Sku | k ∈N}.
Let k ∈N. There exists N ∈N such that tn(Sku) = 0 for every n ≥N. Then, we have
f (Sku) =
N−1

n=0
V Mntn(Sku)
= V ab(σ N−1(pN−1(Sku)) . . . σ(p1(Sku))p0(Sku))
= V ab(u[0,k))
= φ(Sku).
4. Usual Rauzy fractal
The previous section deﬁned a Rauzy fractal for general subshifts and for various choices
of projections. In this section, we focus on subshifts associated with primitive substitutions
whose Perron eigenvalue of the incidence matrix is a Pisot unit, and we consider a
particular choice of projection that permits to have many nice properties. More precisely,
we assume the following.
HYPOTHESIS 4.1
•
σ is a primitive substitution over an alphabet A such that the Perron eigenvalue of Mσ
is a unit Pisot number β of degree d + 1.
•
u ∈σ is an admissible ﬁxed point of σ.
•
V : RA →Rd is a projection along ker((M −βI)P (M)), where P ∈Z[X] is such
that the characteristic polynomial of Mσ has the form πβP , where πβ is the minimal
polynomial of β. In other words, V is a projection along every generalized eigenspace
except for the conjugates of modulus less than 1 of the Perron eigenvalue β.
•
φ = φu,V ,σ, R = φ(σ) and for every a ∈A, Ra = φ([a]).
Deﬁnition 4.2. Under Hypothesis 4.1, we say that R is a usual Rauzy fractal of σ.
Such usual Rauzy fractals have a lot of nice properties.
Properties 4.3. Under Hypothesis 4.1, we have the following properties:
•
there exists a unique invertible endomorphism N of Rd such that NV = V Mσ and
| det(N)| = 1/β;
•
the union Ra = 

t−→a NRb + V t is disjoint in Lebesgue measure;
•
V restricted to W(v) is one-to-one, for every v ∈AZ;
•
each Ra is the closure of its interior;
•
each Ra has a boundary of zero Lebesgue measure.
In the remainder of this section, we prove these properties.

The map N is given by Lemma 2.3. The determinant of N is equal to the determinant
of the quotient map M : RA/F →RA/F, where F = ker((M −βI)P (M)). The eigen-
values of this quotient map are all the roots of πβ but β. The hypothesis that the Perron
eigenvalue is a Pisot unit gives us that the product of the roots of πβ is ±1, thus we get
det(N) = ±1/β.
Now, we give several lemmas that permits to prove the other properties.
LEMMA 4.4. We assume Hypothesis 4.1. Then, the pieces Ra, a ∈A, of the Rauzy fractal
are the smallest non-empty compact solutions of the equations
N−1Ra =

Rb + Da,b,
a ∈A,
where Da,b = {N−1V t | b
t−→a}.
Proof. Since u is a ﬁxed point, we have the union
Wa(u) =

b
t−→a
MWb(u) + t.
Then, applying V to both sides and using NV = V M, we get
Ra =

b
t−→a
NRb + V t.
Now, assume that R′
a, a ∈A, are non-empty compact sets satisfying such equations. Since
we have ∥N∥< 1, iterating such equations gives for every a ∈A,
 ∞

n=0
NnV tn | . . .
tn−→· · ·
t0−→a
	
⊂R′
a.
Thus, by Lemma 3.4, we have Ra ⊆R′
a. So Ra, a ∈A, are indeed the smallest non-empty
compact subsets satisfying the equations.
If we iterate the equations of this lemma, we get
N−nRa =

Rb + Dn
a,b,
a ∈A,
where Dn
a,b = {n−1
i=0 Ni−nV ti | b
tn−1
−−→· · ·
t0−→a}.
LEMMA 4.5. There exists ϵ > 0 such that for every a, b ∈A and every n ∈N, the set Dn
a,b
is ϵ-separated: for all x ̸= y ∈Dn
a,b, ∥x −y∥> ϵ.
In the following, we need some notation. The projection map V : RA →Rd can be
factorized: V = VβVP , where VP : RA →ker(πβ(M)) is the projection onto ker(πβ(M))
along ker(P (M)), and where Vβ : ker(πβ(M)) →Rd is a projection along the Perron
eigenspace of M. The projection Vβ is totally irrational, since it is a projection along the
Perron eigenspace of the endomorphism M|ker(πβ(M)) whose characteristic polynomial πβ
is irreducible.

Proof. As VP is a projection along a rational subspace,  = VP ZA is a lattice of
ker(πβ(M)). Additionally, we have M ⊆ since ker(πβ(M)) is invariant under M. We
have det(M|ker(πβ(M))) = ±1 since β is assumed to be an algebraic unit. Thus, we have
M−1 = .
Now let us consider the set
T n
a,b =
 n−1

i=0
Mi−nVP ti | b
tn−1
−−→· · ·
t0−→a
	
.
It is a subset of  since every ti is in ZA. Moreover, since the ti are in a ﬁnite set, it stays
at a bounded distance D > 0 of a hyperplane P of ker(πβ(M)) which is the orthogonal
complement of a left Perron eigenvector of M|ker(πβ(M)). Let
TD = {x ∈ | d(x, P) ≤D}.
For every α > 0, the set T2D ∩V −1
β B(0, α) is ﬁnite, since ker(Vβ) ⊕P = Im(VP ). Thus,
as Vβ is totally irrational, there exists ϵ > 0 such that B(0, ϵ) ∩VβT2D has cardinality one.
Then, for every x, y ∈VβTD such that ∥x −y∥≤ϵ, we have x −y ∈VβT2D ∩B(0, ϵ) by
triangular inequality, so x = y. In other words, the set VβTD is ϵ-separated.
Since we have for every a, b ∈A and every n ∈N, Dn
a,b = VβT n
a,b ⊂VβTD, we get the
result.
Such subsets VβTD of Rd are sometimes called cut-and-project sets.
LEMMA 4.6. Under Hypothesis 4.1, the projection V is one-to-one on W(v) for any
bi-inﬁnite word v ∈AZ.
Proof. Let V ˆβ : RA →ker(M −βI) be the projection on ker(M −βI) along ker(Q(M))
where (X −β)Q(X) is the characteristic polynomial of M. Let us show that V ˆβ is
one-to-one on W(v). We have V ˆβM = βV ˆβ, so the matrix of V ˆβ is a left Perron eigenvector
of M for any choice of basis of ker(M −βI). Thus, we can choose a basis of ker(M −βI)
such that it has strictly positive coordinates. Now, if we take two distinct elements of W(v),
their difference is the abelianization of a non-empty word, so it is a non-negative and
non-zero vector of ZA. Thus, its image by V ˆβ is strictly positive and V ˆβ is one-to-one on
W(v). As, we have V ˆβ = V ˆβVP , it proves that VP is also one-to-one on W(v). Then, the
total irrationality of Vβ and the fact that VP W(v) is rational give the result.
LEMMA 4.7. Under Hypothesis 4.1, the Lebesgue measure of Ra is non-zero for every
a ∈A.
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of [SW, Proposition 2.8]. Thanks to Lemma 4.5,
one can choose ϵ > 0 such that for every n ∈N, the set Dn
a = 
b∈A Dn
a,b is 2ϵ-separated.
Thanks to Lemma 4.6, the cardinality of the set Dn
a,u0 is |σ n(u0)|a = et
aMneu0, where u0
is the ﬁrst letter of the ﬁxed point u. Hence,
λ(

Let D be large enough such that for every b ∈A, N 
x∈Dn
b B(x, D) ⊆B(0, D). Then the
sequence of sets Nn 
x∈Dna B(x, D) decreases and its intersection is Ra, thus
λ(Ra) = lim

This limit is strictly greater than zero since 1/βnMn converges to the matrix in the
canonical basis of the projector V ˆβ deﬁned in the proof of Lemma 4.6 and since we have
et
aV ˆβeu0 > 0.
LEMMA 4.8. Under Hypothesis 4.1, for every a ∈A, Ra has a non-empty interior and is
the closure of its interior.
Note that this lemma has similarities with [AM, Lemma 8.3.4] but it is not equivalent:
it has different hypotheses, different conclusion, and the tools used are not the same even
if in both cases the idea is to use the self-similarity of the objects. To show this lemma, we
use the following theorem due to Sirvent and Wang, see [SW, Theorem 3.1].
THEOREM 4.9. (Sirvent–Wang) Let (X1, . . . , XJ ) be the attractor of a strongly con-
nected graph-directed IFS
A(Xi) =
J
j=1
(Xj + Dij),
i = 1, . . . , J.
Assume that there exists ϵ > 0 such that the sets Dm
i,j are ϵ-separated for all i, j, m, and
assume that X1 has a positive Lebesgue measure. Then every Xi has a non-empty interior
and is the closure of its interior.
Proof of Lemma 4.8. Let us show that the hypotheses of Theorem 4.9 are fulﬁlled. The
sets Ra, a ∈A, are the attractor of an equation of this form, with A = N−1 and Dij =
{N−1V t | j
t−→i} thanks to Lemma 4.4. The sets Dn
a,b are ϵ-separated by Lemma 4.5.
Additionally, the sets Ra have non-zero Lebesgue measure by Lemma 4.7. Therefore, we
can apply the theorem and it gives the result.
It remains to show that the union
Ra =

b
t−→a
NRb + V t
is disjoint in measure. We follow a classical argument due to Host (see [AI]). We have the
inequality
λ(Ra) ≤

b
t−→a
λ(NRb) = 1
β

b
t−→a
λ(Rb).
Let X = (λ(Ra))a∈A. We get the inequality X ≤(1/β)MX since the matrix of the
preﬁx–sufﬁx automaton is M. Now we use the following lemma.
https://doi.org/10.1017/etds.2023.101 Published online by Cambridge University Press

14
P. Mercat
LEMMA 4.10. (Perron–Frobenius) Let M be a primitive positive matrix, with maximal
eigenvalue λ. Suppose that v is a positive vector such that Mv ≥λv. Then the inequality
is an equality and v is an eigenvector with respect to λ.
Proof. See [AI, Lemma 11].
We deduce from this lemma that the inequality X ≤(1/β)MX is an equality, thus the
union Ra = 
b
t−→a NRb + V t is disjoint in Lebesgue measure.
Now, to prove that each Ra has a boundary of zero Lebesgue measure, it sufﬁces to use
that some Ra0 has non-empty interior and to iterate
Ra0 =

k=0
V Mktk,
up to having a term of the union of the form Nn+1Ra + t completely included in the
interior of Ra0. As the union is disjoint in Lebesgue measure, it gives that the boundary of
Ra has zero Lebesgue measure.
It ﬁnishes the proof of Properties 4.3.
5. Conjugacy with a domain exchange
In this section, we prove Theorem 1.4. The domain exchange is obtained as a usual Rauzy
fractal for a proper substitution thanks to the following. The following proposition will also
be useful to construct ﬁnite extensions of torus translations. It is a generalization of [AM,
Lemma 8.2.7].
PROPOSITION 5.1. Assume Hypothesis 4.1 and assume that σ is proper. Then we have the
following:
•
the unions R = 
a∈A Ra = 
a∈A Ra + V ea are disjoint in Lebesgue measure;
•
we can deﬁne a domain exchange almost everywhere by
E : R
→R
x
	→x + V ea
if x ∈Ra,
and it is invertible;
•
φ is a measurable conjugacy between the uniquely ergodic subshift (σ, S) and the
domain exchange (R, E, λ).
In particular, we have the following theorem.
THEOREM 5.2. Let σ be a primitive proper substitution such that the Perron eigenvalue
of the incidence matrix is a unit Pisot number of degree d + 1. Then, the uniquely ergodic
subshift (σ, S) is measurably isomorphic to a domain exchange (R, E, λ), with R ⊂Rd.
In these results, the hypothesis that σ is proper can be replaced with the strong
coincidence hypothesis (see [AI]). Notice that this result is already stated in [BS, Theorem
6], but without proof, and it is proven but not stated in [SW] (they assume additional
hypotheses that are not really used in their proof). The result could be generalized by

Geometrical representation of subshifts for primitive substitutions

avoiding the hypothesis that the Pisot number is a unit by considering p-adic spaces, but it
would complicate the proof.
Proof of Proposition 5.1. Let a0 ∈A be the letter such that for every b ∈A, σ(b) starts
with the letter a0. Hence for every letter b ∈A, b
0−→a0 is a transition in the abelianized
preﬁx automaton. Thus, the union 
b∈A NRb appears in the union Ra0 = 
b
t−→a0 NRb +
V t, so it is Lebesgue disjoint by Properties 4.3. Then,
λ(R) = λ
 
b∈A
Rb + V eb

≤

b∈A
λ(Rb) = λ
 
b∈A
Rb

= λ(R),
thus the union 
b∈A Rb + V eb is also Lebesgue disjoint.
Then, the domain exchange E can be deﬁned almost everywhere and is invertible. Then,
let F0 = (
a∈A int(Ra)) ∩(
a∈A int(Ra) + V ea). The maps E and E−1 are everywhere
deﬁned in F0. Then, for every n ∈N, we deﬁne by induction the open subsets Fn+1 =
E(Fn) ∩E−1(Fn) ∩F0. The intersection F = 
n∈N Fn is a subset of R of full Lebesgue
measure being invariant under E and E−1.
Now we deﬁne the natural coding. Since V is one-to-one on W(u), φ is one-to-one on
O(u), and we can deﬁne the map χ : G →A, where G = F ∪φ(O(u)), by χ(x) = a if
x ∈F ∩Ra and χ(x) = un if x = φ(Snu). Additionally, we can also deﬁne E on φ(O(u))
by E(φ(Snu)) = φ(Sn+1u) = φ(Snu) + V ab(un) and E is well deﬁned on G. Then, we
deﬁne the coding map, well deﬁned on G by
cod : G →AZ,
x
	→(χ(Enx))n∈Z.
We have cod ◦E = S ◦cod and the restriction of cod ◦φ to O(u) is the identity.
Let us show that Im(cod) ⊆. For x ∈φ(O(u)), we have cod(x) ∈O(u) ⊆. Let
x ∈F. For every N ∈N, since the set FN is open, there exists a neighborhood U of x such
that for every n ∈[−N, N], χ ◦En|U is a constant. Additionally, since φ(O(u)) is dense
in R, U contains an element of φ(O(u)). Thus, cod(x) is arbitrarily close to an element of
O(u) so it is in .
Moreover, the map φ is continuous. Thus for every x ∈F and every ϵ > 0, there exists
a neighborhood U of x whose image by φ ◦cod has a diameter at most ϵ. Additionally,
for y ∈U ∩φ(O(u)) ∩B(x, ϵ), we have φ ◦cod(y) = y, thus |φ ◦cod(x) −x| ≤|φ ◦
cod(x) −φ ◦cod(y)| + |y −x| ≤2ϵ. We deduce that φ ◦cod is the identity map of G.
Now, let μ be the push-forward measure of the Lebesgue measure λ by the continuous
map cod |F . Then μ is an invariant measure and we get that (, S, μ) is isomorphic to
(R, E, λ).
Thank to Theorem 2.4, we can proprify σ. Thus, Theorem 1.4 is a consequence of
Theorem 5.2.
6. Eigenvalues of the dynamical system
This section aims to prove Theorem 1.5. Note that for one implication, we do not need
properness or unimodularity.

PROPOSITION 6.1. Let σ be a primitive aperiodic substitution. Assume that there exists
a row vector w ∈ZA such that for every generalized eigenvector v for an eigenvalue of
modulus ≥1, wv = α if v has sum 1 and wv = 0 if v has sum 0, then e2iπα is an eigenvalue
of (σ, S).
For the reciprocal, we need the following proposition (see [DP, Proposition 13]).
PROPOSITION 6.2. Let σ be a primitive proper substitution. If e2iπα is an eigenvalue of
(σ, S), then α(1, . . . , 1)Mn
σ −−−→
n→∞0 mod Z.
Additionally, we give a characterization of this condition.
LEMMA 6.3. Let α ∈R and let M ∈Md(Z) be a pseudo-unimodular matrix. We have the
equivalence:
α(1, . . . , 1)Mn −−−→
n→∞0 mod Zd,
⇕
there exists w ∈Zd, (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)Mn −−−→
n→∞0.
To prove this equivalence, we need the following.
LEMMA 6.4. Let M ∈Md(Z) be a pseudo-unimodular matrix. Then there exists m ∈N≥1
such that for all y ∈Zd ∩Im(Mm), there exists x ∈Zd ∩Im(Mm) such that Mmx = y.
Proof. Let m ≥1 such that ker(Mm) and Im(Mm) are supplementary subspaces. Since
Im(Mm) is a rational subspace, the intersection  = Im(Mm) ∩Zd is a lattice of Im(Mm).
Let f : Im(Mm) →Im(Mm) be the restriction of Mm to Im(Mm). We have f () ⊆
and the pseudo-unimodular hypothesis gives det(f ) = ±1. The matrix of f in a basis of
the lattice is in GLr(Z), where r is the rank of Mm, thus f −1() ⊆.
Proof of Lemma 6.3. Assume that
α(1, . . . , 1)Mn −−−→
n→∞0 mod Zd.
Let an ∈Zd be the row vector such that α(1, . . . , 1)Mn −an ∈(−1/2, 1/2]d. We have
anM −an+1 −−−→
n→∞0, so there exists n0 ∈N such that for every n ≥n0, an+1 = anM.
Let m ≥1 be given by Lemma 6.4 for the matrix Mt. Then, there exists a row vector
w ∈Zd such that an = wMn for every n ≥(n0 + 1)m. Hence, we have (α(1, . . . , 1) −
w)Mn −−−→
n→∞0. The reciprocal is obvious.
Now we give another characterization of the condition.
LEMMA 6.5. Let α ∈R, let M be a matrix of size d, and let w ∈Zd be a row vector. We
have (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)Mn −−−→
n→∞0 if and only if for every generalized eigenvector v for
an eigenvalue of modulus ≥1,

wv = α
if v has sum 1,
wv = 0
if v has sum 0.
Moreover, the convergence is exponential.

Proof. [⇒] Let us show that for every generalized eigenvector v for an eigenvalue β
with |β| ≥1, we have (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)v = 0. We show it by induction on k ≥1 such
that (M −βI)kv = 0 and (M −βI)k−1v ̸= 0.
•
If k = 1, then (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)Mnv = βn(α(1, . . . , 1) −w)v −−−→
n→∞0. Thus, it
implies that (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)v = 0.
•
If k > 1, for every n ∈N, we have
Mnv −βnv =
k−1

i=1
n
i

βn−i(M −βI)iv ∈ker((M −βI)k−1),
so by the induction hypothesis, we have βn(α(1, . . . , 1) −w)v −−−→
n→∞0 and we
conclude.
Now, if v has sum 1, the equality (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)v = 0 implies α = wv. If v has
sum 0, it implies wv = 0.
[⇐] Let x ∈Rd. Then, there exists coefﬁcients c1, . . . , cd ∈C and generalized eigen-
vectors v1, . . . , vd such that x = c1v1 + · · · + cdvd. We can assume that each vector vi as
a sum 0 or 1. Then, we have (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)Mnx = d
i=1 ci(α(1, . . . , 1) −w)Mnvi.
If vi is associated to an eigenvalue βi with |βi| < 1, then Mnvi −−−→
n→∞0. Otherwise,
the hypothesis gives (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)vi = 0. Thus, for all x ∈Rd, (α(1, . . . , 1) −
w)Mnx −−−→
n→∞0. We conclude that (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)Mn −−−→
n→∞0. Moreover, the con-
vergence is exponential.
LEMMA 6.6. Let σ be a primitive aperiodic substitution and let α ∈R. Suppose there
exists a row vector w ∈ZA such that (α(1, . . . , 1) −w)Mn
σ −−−→
n→∞0.
Then, e2iπα is an eigenvalue of the dynamical system (σ, S).
Proof. Let v = α(1, . . . , 1) −w. Thanks to Lemma 6.5, the convergence of vMn is
exponential. Now by Lemma 3.4, the map φv = φu,v,σ is well deﬁned, for an admissible
ﬁxed point u of σ (we can assume that σ has an admissible ﬁxed point up to replace σ by
a power of itself). For every a ∈A, we have vea = α mod Z, so we have φv ◦S = φv + α
mod Z, by Proposition 3.3.
Thus, we get that π ◦φv : σ →R/Z is well deﬁned, where π : R →R/Z is the
canonical projection, and we have π ◦φv ◦S = π ◦φv + α. We conclude that e2iπα is
an eigenvalue of (σ, S) for the continuous eigenfunction e2iπ(π◦φv).
Now, Proposition 6.1 and Theorem 1.5 are obvious consequences of these lemmas.
In the particular case of unimodular substitutions, Proposition 6.2 gives the following.
LEMMA 6.7. Let σ be a primitive proper unimodular substitution. Then, the only
eigenvalue of the subshift (σ, S) being a root of unity is 1.
Proof. Let α ∈Q such that ei2πα is an eigenvalue of the subshift (σ, S), and let
p ≥1 be an integer such that αp ∈Z. Since Mσ is unimodular, it is in the ﬁnite
group GL(Z/pZ) modulo p, thus there exists k ≥1 such that Mk
σ is the identity

matrix modulo p. By Proposition 6.2, we have α(1, . . . , 1)Mkn
σ −−−→
n→∞0 mod ZA. Thus,
α(1, . . . , 1) −−−→
n→∞0 mod ZA, so α ∈Z.
7. Explicit computation of eigenvalues
Thanks to Theorems 2.4 and 1.5, we can compute the eigenvalues of the subshift for any
primitive pseudo-unimodular substitution. The aim of this section is to provide an explicit
computation algorithm. From an input substitution, we compute a proper substitution
in §7.1 and then we compute eigenvalues of the subshift from the proper substitution
in §7.2.
7.1. Propriﬁcation algorithm.
In this subsection, we compute a propriﬁcation, as
deﬁned in §2.4. We do it by following the propriﬁcation algorithm of Durand and Petite
(see [Durand] and see [DP, Corollary 9] for more details).
We start with an input primitive substitution σ. The ﬁrst step is to compute the return
substitution. To do it, perform the following.
•
Replace σ by a power of itself to ensure that it has an inﬁnite ﬁxed point.
•
Let a ∈A be the ﬁrst letter of a left-inﬁnite ﬁxed point u ∈AN. We call a return word
on letter a, a word w such that wa is a subword of u, and such that w has a unique
occurrence of the letter a, at the ﬁrst position.Let w0 ∈A∗be the unique return word
such that u starts by w0. Start with S = {w0}.
•
Take out an element w from S. Decompose σ(w) as a product of return words (such
decomposition is unique). Add to S every return word w not already seen. Continue
until S is empty.
The number of return words being ﬁnite, this terminates and gives a return substitution τ,
whose alphabet is the set R of return words.
Then, we deﬁne a substitution ξ over the alphabet B = {(r, p) | r ∈R, 1 ≤p ≤|r|} by
ξ(r, p) =

ψ((τ(r))p)
if 1 ≤p < |r|,
ψ((τ(r))[|r|,|τ(r)|])
if p = |r|,
where ψ : R∗→B∗is the morphism deﬁned by ψ(r) = (r, 1)(r, 2) . . . (r, |r|). We can
show that a power of ξ is left-proper. Additionally, we easily get a proper substitution from
this. However, the fact that a power of ξ is left-proper is enough to apply our results.
Example 7.1. Let σ : 1 	→213, 2 	→4, 3 	→5, 4 	→1, 5 	→21.
The cube of σ has a left-inﬁnite ﬁxed point
1421352142135213142135214213142135213142 . . .
Return words on 1 are a = 142, b = 1352, and c = 13, and we get the return substitution
τ : a 	→ababc, b 	→abacabc, c 	→abac which is left-proper.

Then, the substitution ξ
is 0 	→012, 1 	→3456, 2 	→012345678, 3 	→012, 4 	→
3456, 5 	→012, 6 	→78012345678, 7 	→012, 8 	→345601278, with the identiﬁcations
0 = (a, 1),
1 = (a, 2),
2 = (a, 3),
3 = (b, 1),
4 = (b, 2),
5 = (b, 3),
6 = (b, 4),
7 = (c, 1), 8 = (c, 2). The square of ξ is left-proper and its subshift is conjugate to
the subshift of σ.
7.2. Computation of eigenvalues for a proper substitution.
Now, a power of σ is
assumed to be left-proper. The computation of eigenvalues of the subshift is as follows.
Let K be the splitting ﬁeld of the characteristic polynomial of the incidence matrix
M. Let v0, . . . , vk be a family of vectors of KA formed as a concatenation of bases
of generalized eigenspaces for eigenvalues of modulus ≥1, and with v0 the Perron
eigenvector of sum 1. Then, we compute a set S as follows. Start with S = ∅. Then, for
every i ∈{1, . . . , k}:
•
if vi has sum zero, then add it to S;
•
otherwise normalize vi such that it has sum 1, then add vi −v0 to S.
Now, the possible row vectors w ∈ZA of Theorem 1.5 are exactly those that are
orthogonal to every vector of S. We can describe this set as the kernel of an integer matrix
by the following.
Choose a basis of the number ﬁeld K seen as a Q-vector space. Decompose each vector
of S in this basis. Form a matrix MS whose columns are these components. Multiply in
place the matrix MS by an integer to have MS with coefﬁcients in Z.
Then, we obtain eigenvalues as the set
{e2iπwv0 | w ∈ZA and wMS = 0}.
Additionally, we can completely describe this set by computing a basis of the Z-module of
such w, and then computing a basis of the Z-module of possible wv0, using for example
the Schmidt normal form.

is irreducible and has two eigenvalues of modulus ≥1, associated to eigenvectors of
non-zero sum. Hence, the set S is reduced to one element which is the difference of the
two different eigenvectors of sum 1. Here, both eigenvectors live in the ﬁeld Q(β), with β
the Perron eigenvalue, so we can do the computation in this ﬁeld rather than the splitting
ﬁeld. The computation in this ﬁeld gives S = {1/41(−6β3 + 9β2 −17β + 7, 18β3 −
27β2 −31β + 20, −14β3 + 21β2 + 15β −11, 2β3 −3β2 + 33β −16)t}. Thus, in the
basis (1, β, β2, β3), the matrix MS is

Then, the set of row vectors w ∈Z4 such that wMS = 0 is the Z-module generated by
(1, 1, 1, 1) and (0, 3, 4, 1). Then, we get
{wv0 | w ∈ZA and wMS = 0} = Z + (−β2 + β + 2)Z = Z[
√
2],
where v0 is the Perron eigenvector of sum 1.
We can moreover check that σ has no non-trivial coboundary and it has an initial period
of 1 (see [Host] for more details), so the eigenvalues of the subshift are indeed e2iπn

n ∈Z. The computation from a propriﬁcation leads to the same result. Notice that there is

8. Finite extension of a torus translation
This section mainly aims to prove Theorem 1.2. However, before we show that, the
hypothesis that the Perron eigenvalue is Pisot is necessary.
PROPOSITION 8.1. Let σ be a primitive pseudo-unimodular substitution. If the Perron
eigenvalue β of the incidence matrix is not Pisot, then the subshift has strictly less
rationally independent eigenvalues than the degree of β.
Proof. Thanks to Theorem 2.4, we can assume that σ is proper. Let β > 1 be the
Perron eigenvalue of the incidence matrix. Let γ be a conjugate of β with |γ | ≥1.
Let ϕ : Q(β) →Q(γ ) be the morphism of ﬁelds such that ϕ(β) = γ . Let e2iπα be an
eigenvalue of the subshift. Let vβ be the Perron eigenvector of sum 1. Then, vγ = ϕ(vβ)
is an eigenvector of sum 1 for the eigenvalue γ . By Theorem 1.5, there exists a row
vector w ∈ZA such that α = wvβ = wvγ . Thus, we have ϕ(α) = α. Hence, α lives in
the Q-vector space {x ∈Q(β) | ϕ(x) = x} whose dimension is strictly less than deg(β)
since it does not contain β.
8.1. Proof of Theorem 1.2.
Our proof of Theorem 1.2 is similar to the proof of the
main theorem in [DP]. The idea is the following. We start by showing that there exists
rationally independent eigenvalues. Then, we get a minimal translation on the torus Td
as a factor, with a Rauzy fractal R′. Then, we use the fact that the substitution is proper
to construct a domain exchange on another Rauzy fractal R, which is conjugate to the
subshift. Additionally, we deﬁne a map ψ : R →R′ being a translation by pieces, thus
ﬁnite-to-one, so the extension is ﬁnite.

8.1.1. Existence of rationally independent eigenvalues.
Let us show that there exists
rationally independent numbers 1, α1, . . . , αd such that e2iπα1, . . . ,e2iπαd are eigenvalues
of the subshift. We decompose the minimal polynomial of M = Mσ in the form πβXkQ,
where πβ is the minimal polynomial of the Perron eigenvalue β, and with Q(0) ̸= 0.
We can assume that k = 1 up to replacing σ by σ k. Then, the row vector (1, . . . , 1) is
orthogonal to ker(Q(M)) thanks to the following lemma.
LEMMA 8.2. Let M be a matrix with integer coefﬁcients. If γ is an eigenvalue of M
such that every associated generalized eigenvector has sum zero, then every generalized
eigenvector associated with a conjugate of γ also has sum zero.
Proof. Let β be a conjugate of γ and let ϕ : Q(β) →Q(γ ) be the morphism of ﬁelds
sending β to γ . Let v be a generalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue β. Let k ≥1 such that
(M −βI)kv = 0. Then it gives (M −γ I)kϕ(v) = 0. Thus, ϕ(v) is a generalized eigen-
vector for the eigenvalue γ . Additionally, we have ϕ((1, . . . , 1)v) = (1, . . . , 1)ϕ(v) = 0,
so (1, . . . , 1)v = 0.
Let w0 = (1, . . . , 1), w1, . . . , wd be row vectors in the orthogonal complement
of ker(Q(M)) that are linearly independent modulo the orthogonal complement of
ker((πβQ)(M)). As we have rational subspaces, we can assume that every vector wi is
in ZA.
Let v0 be the Perron eigenvector of sum 1. Let us show that 1, w1v0, . . . , wdv0
are rationally independent. Let c0, . . . , cd ∈Q such that c0w0v0 + · · · + cdwdv0 =
0 = (c0w0 + · · · + cdwd)v0. Then, as c0w0 + · · · + cdwd is rational, it is orthogonal
to every conjugate of v0, thus to ker(πβ(M)). As c0w0 + · · · + cdwd is orthogonal to
ker((πβQ)(M)), every ci is zero. Additionally, by Proposition 6.1, e2iπαi are eigenvalues
of the dynamical system, where αi = wiv0, since every generalized eigenvector of zero
sum, for an eigenvalue of modulus at least 1, is in ker(Q(M)).
8.1.2. Minimal torus translation as a factor.
Now, we show that the subshift is an
extension of a minimal translation of the torus Td. Let V ′ be the matrix whose rows
are αi(1, . . . , 1) −wi, i = 1, . . . , d. By Lemma 6.5, the convergence V ′Mn −−−→
n→∞0
is exponential. Thus, by Lemma 3.4, the map φV ′ = φu,V ′,σ
of Proposition 3.1
is well deﬁned. It permits to deﬁne a Rauzy fractal R′ = φV ′(σ). Additionally,
for every x ∈σ, we have φV ′(Sx) = φV ′(x) + V ′ ab(x0) = φV ′(x) + α mod ZA,
where α = (α1, . . . , αd) ∈Rd. Thus, by the map π ◦φV ′ :  →Td, the subshift is a

22
P. Mercat
measurable extension of the translation by α on the torus Td. This translation is minimal
since 1, α1, . . . , αd are linearly independent over Q.
To end the proof of Theorem 1.2, it remains to show that this extension is ﬁnite.
8.1.3. Construction of a domain exchange.
Now, we show that the subshift is conjugate
to a domain exchange. Let  be the projection on Im(M) = ker((πβQ)(M)) along
ker(M). We have M = M and we can use the following lemma.
LEMMA 8.3. Let  be a rational matrix such that M = M. Then, the row vectors
(1, . . . , 1), w1, . . . , wd are linearly independent.
Proof. Let c0, c1, . . . , cd be such that c0(1, . . . , 1) + c1w1 + · · · + cdwd = 0.
We can assume that every ci is in Q since  and wi have rational coordinates. Then,
wiMn = αi(1, . . . , 1)Mn + on→∞(1), so
(c0 + c1α1 + · · · + cdαd)(1, . . . , 1)Mn = on→∞(1).
As, (1, . . . , 1)Mn diverges when n tends to inﬁnity, we get c0 + c1α1 + · · · + cdαd = 0.
Then, the linear independence over Q gives ci = 0 for every i.
This lemma tells us that V = V ′ is of rank d. Now, let us show that V satisﬁes
Hypothesis 4.1 to have a usual Rauzy fractal.
We
want
to
show
that
ker((M −βI)MQ(M)) ⊆ker(V ).
As
rank(V ) = d =
codim ker((M −βI)MQ(M)), it will give also the other inclusion. Since polynomials
X −β, X and Q are pairwise coprime, we have
ker((M −βI)MQ(M)) = ker(M −βI) ⊕ker(M) ⊕ker(Q(M)).
By deﬁnition of , we have ker(M) = ker() ⊂ker(V ). By construction, each wi is
orthogonal to ker(Q(M)) and the row vector (1, . . . , 1) is also ortho- gonal to ker(Q(M)),
thus we have ker(Q(M)) ⊆ker(V ′). We also have ker(M −βI) ⊆ker(V ′) by Lemma
6.5. Since, M = M, we obtain ker(M −βI) ⊂ker (M −βI) = ker(M −βI) ⊆
ker(V ) and similarly ker Q(M) ⊂ker(V ). Then, we get the equality ker(V ) = ker((M −
βI)MQ(M)).
Hence, Hypothesis 4.1 is satisﬁed, and φu,V ,σ is well deﬁned and deﬁnes a usual Rauzy
fractal, for an admissible ﬁxed point u (which exists up to replacing σ by a power of itself).
Moreover, since the substitution σ is proper, Proposition 3.3 gives us a domain exchange
on R = φV (σ) measurably conjugated to the subshift.
8.1.4. Translation by pieces.
Now, we show that the almost everywhere deﬁned map
ψ = φV ′ ◦φ−1
V
: R →R′ is a translation by pieces. For almost every x ∈, we have
ψ
 
n∈N
V Mntn(x)

=

n∈N
V ′Mntn(x).
However, for every n ≥1, we have V Mn = V Mn = V ′Mn. Thus, ψ is a translation
by (V ′ −V )t on each piece φV (t−1
0 (t)) = 
b
t−→a NRb + V t for every label t of the
abelianized preﬁx automaton, where t0 = ab ◦p0 : σ →Zd is the map deﬁned in §2.5.

8.1.5. End of the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Since ψ is a translation by pieces, it is
ﬁnite-to-one. The map π : Rd →Td restricted to R′ is also ﬁnite-to-one since R′
is bounded. Hence, π ◦ψ : (R, E, λ) →(Td, Tα, λ) is ﬁnite-to-one, where Tα is the
translation by α = (α1, . . . , αd). Thus, the continuous map π ◦φV ′ : (, S) →(Td, Tα)
is almost everywhere ﬁnite-to-one. It ends the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Remark 8.4. The map ψ = φV ′ ◦φ−1
V
can always be deﬁned almost everywhere, as in
this proof, as soon as V and V ′ are well deﬁned with φV almost everywhere invertible.
Additionally, we have
ψ : R
→R′
∞
n=0 V Mntn 	→∞
n=0 V ′Mntn,
where tn are labels of left-inﬁnite paths in the abelianized preﬁx automaton. However, in
general, this map does not seem to be always ﬁnite-to-one (see Example 9.8).
In the following subsection, we prove the last remaining theorem to prove.
8.2. Proof of Theorem 1.3.
By Theorem 2.4, we can assume that σ is proper. Addition-
ally, up to replacing σ by a power of itself, we can also assume that the only eigenvalue of
the matrix being a root of unity is 1.
If there is no generalized eigenvector v of sum 1 for the eigenvalue 1, then the hypothesis
of Theorem 1.2 is satisﬁed and the subshift is a ﬁnite extension of a translation on the
torus Td.
Otherwise, we use Theorem 1.5. Let v be a generalized eigenvector of sum 1 for the
eigenvalue 1. As the generalized eigenspace for the eigenvalue 1 is rational, we can assume
that v has rational coordinates. Then the eigenvalues of the subshift are of the form e2iπα
with α = wv ∈Q, for some row vectors w ∈ZA. Hence, eigenvalues of the subshift are
roots of unity, and it ends the proof of Theorem 1.3.
9. Examples
Example 9.1. (Non-Pisot, [FMN]) For the primitive unimodular substitution

the subshift has eigenvalues e2inπ

2, n ∈Z. The characteristic polynomial x4 −2x3 −
7x2 −2x + 1 of Mσ is irreducible and the Perron eigenvalue θ1 is not Pisot since there
is another root θ4 of modulus > 1. The subshift is not weakly mixing, in contrast
to what is said in [FMN, Example 1]. They made a miscalculation. They say that
α = θ3

example, Q(X) = 6X −11X2 + 19X3 is a solution that gives α = (7 +

Pisot substitution 1 	→2, 2 	→3, 3 	→14, 4 	→5, 5 	→1425 is measurably conjugate to a
translation on T2. The incidence matrix of a left-propriﬁcation has only one eigenvalue of

modulus ≥1, thus Theorem 1.2 applies. The domain exchange and fundamental domain
are depicted in Figure 1. The eigenvalues of the dynamical system are e2iπα, with
α ∈((2β2 + β −6)/11)Z + (β2 + β)Z, where β is the Pisot number root of X3 −X2 −
X −1.
Example 9.3. (2-to-1 extension of a torus translation) It can be shown that the subshift
of the weakly irreducible Pisot substitution σ : a 	→Ab, b 	→A, A 	→aB, B 	→a is a
2-to-1 extension of a translation on T1. Note that it is a 2-to-1 cover of the subshift
of the original Fibonacci substitution a 	→ab, b 	→a. A left-propriﬁcation of σ has
an incidence matrix with eigenvalues zero, roots of unity associated to generalized
eigenvectors of sum zero, and golden number and conjugate. Thus, Theorem 1.2 applies.
An approximation of the graph of ψ is plotted in Figure 4(right). The eigenvalues of the
subshift are e2iπnϕ, n ∈Z, where ϕ is the golden number.
Example 9.4. (Presumably inﬁnite extension of a torus translation) The subshift of
the primitive substitution 1 	→11116, 2 	→1, 3 	→1111112, 4 	→1111113, 5 	→466,
6 	→566 is a (presumably inﬁnite) extension of a minimal circle translation. Its incidence
matrix is not diagonalizable. Its characteristic polynomial is (x2 −4x −1)(x2 −x −1)2.
The eigenvalues of the dynamical system are e2iπα where α ∈(45/2)ϕZ, where ϕ is the
golden number.
Example 9.5. (Two Pisot, intermediate) The subshift of the primitive substitution
1 	→1116, 2 	→1, 3 	→2, 4 	→3, 5 	→1146, 6 	→566
is neither a ﬁnite extension of a minimal translation of T3 nor weakly mixing. Indeed, the
eigenvalues of the subshift are e2iπα, where α ∈57ϕZ, where ϕ is the golden number, but
the degree of the Perron eigenvalue is 4. The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is
(x2 −x −1) · (x4 −4x3 + 2x2 −x + 1).

gives a weakly mixing subshift. Its incidence matrix has two Pisot eigenvalues of degrees
2 and 3. However, we can describe it geometrically with a domain exchange, see Figure 2.
Example 9.7. (Two Pisot, presumably inﬁnite extension of (T2, T )) The subshift of the
substitution 1 	→16, 2 	→122, 3 	→12, 4 	→3, 5 	→124, 6 	→15 is an (presumably inﬁ-
nite) extension of a translation on the torus T2. Note that the square of this substitution is
left-proper. The incidence matrix has two Pisot eigenvalues of degrees 3. The eigenvalues
of the dynamical system are e2iπα, where α ∈3βZ + 3β3Z, where β is the Perron
eigenvalue of the incidence matrix. We show the domain exchange and the image by ψ
in Figure 3.
Example 9.8. (Two Pisot, presumably inﬁnite extension of (T1, T )) The subshift of the
substitution 1 	→114, 2 	→122, 3 	→2, 4 	→13 is an (presumably inﬁnite) extension of
a translation on R/Z. The incidence matrix has two Pisot eigenvalues of degrees 2. We
plot an approximation of the graph of the function ψ in Figure 4(left). We can see that the
almost everywhere deﬁned function ψ seems to be inﬁnite-to-one. The eigenvalues of the
subshift are e2iπ

is an example for which the usual Rauzy fractal overlaps (see Figure 5). However, we can
proprify it and it permits to obtain a domain exchange that is measurably conjugate to the
subshift of σ. Moreover, the propriﬁcation of σ satisﬁes Theorem 1.2, thus it is also a ﬁnite
extension of a torus translation.
Notice that the return substitution of σ 3 on any letter has only three letters. The
eigenvalues of the subshift are e2iπα, where α ∈Z[β], where β is the real root of
