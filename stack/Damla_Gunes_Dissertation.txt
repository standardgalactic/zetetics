Abstract
Understanding Carry Trade Risks using Bayesian Methods:
A Comparison with Other Portfolio Risks from Currency, Commodity and Stock Markets
Damla Gunes
The purpose of this dissertation is to understand the risks embedded in Carry Trades.
For this, we use a broad range of stochastic volatility (SV) models, estimate them using
Bayesian techniques via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and analyze various risk mea-
sures using these estimation results. Many researchers have tried to explain the risk factors
deriving Carry returns with standard risk models (factor models, Sharp ratios etc.). How-
ever, the high negative conditional skewness of Carry Trades hints the existence of jumps
and shows that they have non normal returns, suggesting looking only at ﬁrst two moments
such as sharp ratios or using standard risk models are not enough to understand their risks.
Therefore, we investigate Carry risks by delving into its SV and jump components and sep-
arate out their eﬀects for a more thorough analysis. We also compare these results with
other market portfolios (S&P 500, Fama HML, Momentum, Gold, AUD/USD, Euro/USD,
USD/JPY, DXY, Long Rate Carry and Delta Short Rate Carry) to be able to judge the
riskiness of Carry relative to other investment alternatives.
We then introduce a new model diagnostic method, which overcomes the ﬂaws of
the previous methods used in the literature. This is important since model selection is a
central question in SV literature, and although various methods were suggested earlier, they
do not provide a reliable measure of ﬁt. Using this new diagnostic method, we select the
best-ﬁtted SV model for each portfolio and use their estimation results to carry out the risk
analysis. We ﬁnd that the extremes of volatility, direct negative impact of volatilities on
returns, percent of overall risk due to jumps considering both returns and vols, and negative
skewness are all more pronounced for Carry Trades than for other portfolios. This shows

that Carry risks are more complicated than other portfolios. Hence, we are able to remove
a layer from the Carry risks by analyzing its jump and SV components in more depth.
We also present the rolling correlations of these portfolio returns, vols, and jumps to
understand if they co-move and how these co-movements change over time. We ﬁnd that
despite being dollar-neutral, Carry is still prone to dollar risk. DXY-S&P appear to be neg-
atively correlated after 2003, when dollar becomes a safe-haven investment. S&P-AUD are
very positively correlated since both are risky assets, except during currency speciﬁc events
such as central bank interventions. MOM becomes negatively correlated with Carry during
crisis and recovery periods since MOM yields positive returns in crisis and its returns plunge
in recovery. Carry-Gold are mostly positively correlated, which might be used to form more
enhanced trading and hedging strategies. Carry-S&P are mostly very positively correlated,
and their jump probability correlations peak during big ﬁnancial events. Delta Carry, on
the other hand, distinguishes from other portfolios as a possible hedging instrument. It is
not prominently correlated to any of the portfolios. These correlations motivate us to search
for common factors deriving the 11 portfolios under consideration. We ﬁnd through the
Principal Component Analysis that there are four main components to explain their returns
and two main components to explain their vols. Moreover, the ﬁrst component in volatility
is the common factor deriving all risky asset vols, explaining 75% of the total variance.
To model this dynamic relationship between these portfolios, we estimate a multivari-
ate normal Markov switching (MS) model using them. Then we develop a dynamic trading
strategy, in which we use the MS model estimation results as input to the mean-variance
optimization to ﬁnd the optimal portfolio weights to invest in at each period. This trading
strategy is able to dynamically diversify between the portfolios, and having a sharp ratio of
1.25, it performs much better than the input and benchmark portfolios. Finally, MS results
indicate that Delta Carry has the lowest variance and positive expected return in both states
of the MS model. This supports our ﬁndings from risk analysis that Delta Carry performs
well during volatile periods, and vol elevations have a direct positive impact on its returns.

Introduction
Currency Carry Trades are investment strategies where one borrows in low interest rate
currencies and invests in high interest rate currencies. The value of the exchange rate at the
end of the period is the sole source of risk. The hope is for the high interest rate currency
not to depreciate with respect to the low interest rate currency more than what would oﬀset
the gain from the interest rate diﬀerence by the end of the holding period.
Uncovered interest parity (UIP), one of the most fundamental theorems in interna-
tional ﬁnance, assumes that high interest rate currencies depreciate with respect to low
interest rate currencies, making the excess Carry return equal to zero. However, empirically
the opposite tends to happen. Hence, currency Carry Trades have yielded very high returns
historically. This empirical result is called the ’forward premium anomaly,’ and it is one of
the most prominent features of the exchange rate market.
Considering the very liquid foreign exchange market with a daily $4 trillion turnover
(Bank of International Settlements, 2010), the forward premium anomaly has been of interest
to many practitioners and academicians. The most common way they have tried to explain
this phenomenon is by investors’ risk aversion (Brunnermeier, Nagel, & Pedersen, 2008;
Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski, & Rebelo, 2008; Jurek, 2008).
Uncovered interest
parity assumes that investors are risk neutral. However, investors are generally assumed to
be risk averse (Fama & MacBeth, 1973; Merton, 1973; Hansen & Hodrick, 1983). So, high
returns of Carry Trades have been attributed to the investors’ demand to be compensated
for taking on the risk of exposure to big exchange rate losses in volatile times. One example
of this is during the 2008 crisis when the gains earned by Carry Trades for 5 years evaporated
during the crisis period.
Many people considered time-varying risk premia and crash risk as a solution to the
UIP puzzle. However, empirical literature can’t convincingly identify risk factors that drive
these premia.
Without a complete explanation to the UIP puzzle, international ﬁnance

2
continues to falsely assume that UIP applies.
The motivation of this research is to identify the risks embedded in currency Carry
Trades beyond what can be seen through simple Sharp ratios and standard risk models.
The high negative conditional skewness of Carry Trades hints the existence of jumps and
shows that they have non normal returns, suggesting looking only at ﬁrst two moments
such as Sharp ratios or using standard risk models are not enough to understand their risks.
Here, using a broad range of stochastic volatility models (SV) in a Bayesian framework, we1
delve into the SV and jump components of Carry returns and separate out their eﬀects.
And, we compare these with risks of other market portfolios from stocks, currencies and
commodities. We show that the volatility extremes, negative impact of volatility on returns,
percent of variance due to jumps in returns and volatilities, and negative skewness are all
more pronounced for Carry Trades than for other market portfolios. The implications of
these ﬁndings are listed below.
Since jumps play the biggest role in the riskiness of Carry, more of the large deviations
from expected return will be due to rare but extreme losses (from return or vol jumps).
However, for other portfolios, we expect these deviations to occur less from these extreme
events and more from consecutive losses due to small volatility elevations. This is important
in forming portfolio decisions since, whereas a single jump can wipe out about 20% of the
return, and they are hard to predict, volatility elevations can be captured via some signals,
which can allow getting out of the position. Supporting the observation that jumps, which
are expected to be negative, play a big role in Carry risks; Carry has the second highest
negative conditional skewness after S&P. So, we expect more negative returns than positive
returns for Carry compared to other portfolios. Moreover, Carry volatilities elevate to much
higher levels relative to its average vol compared to other portfolios (together with MOM
and HML). This also indicates why we should not rely on simple sharp ratios.
Even if
1I have chosen to use the academic ’we’ instead of ’I’ in my dissertation; however, there should be no
doubt that it is the result of my own work and so are all shortcomings.

its average volatility is lower than some other portfolios (resulting in lower sharp ratio), it
reaches to higher extremes, which is what is important in the risk analysis since big losses
usually occur either due to return jumps or big volatility elevations (such as vol jumps).
Hence, Carry is more prone to big losses than other portfolios due to its extreme volatility
elevations. Finally, we ﬁnd that only for Carry, vol elevations have a direct negative impact
on returns. For other portfolios, vols aﬀect returns only through the noise term.
The above observations show that Carry risks are more complicated than other port-
folios. We are able to remove a layer from its risks by analyzing its jump and stochastic
volatility components in more depth.
We start our analysis by exploring diﬀerent stochastic volatility models to ﬁnd the
one that best describes each of the market portfolios we consider. Stochastic volatility (SV)
models have long attracted researchers in ﬁnance and economics since they are useful in
explaining the random behavior of ﬁnancial markets (Eraker, Johannes, & Polson, 2003;
Jacquier, Polson, & Rossi, 2002; Kim, Shephard, & Chib, 1998). However, Johannes and
Polson (2003) observe a number of reasons why it is diﬃcult to estimate the model. First, it is
a nonlinear and continuous model, whereas data observations are discrete. Second, there are
latent state variables, and these together with parameters are usually very high dimensional.
And ﬁnally, the state variables have non-normal and non-standard distributions.
We use Bayesian techniques via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to
overcome these problems. Bayesian statistics is an inference method where the probabilities
of unknown parameters and latent variables are computed conditional on the observed data.
Bayesian inference has strong theoretical foundations. These are noted by Johannes and
Polson (in press) as follows. It removes the need for calculating marginalized likelihoods and
provides a way to estimate the parameters and latent variables together. It also naturally
incorporates newly arriving data, takes into account prior belief or information and by treat-
ing parameters as unknowns, it considers estimation risk. One caveat of Bayesian inference

4
is its computational complexity. Most posteriors don’t have closed-form distributions, and
some approximating methods were used in earlier periods. However, the development of
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods overcame this complexity and made Bayesian
applications practical and eﬃcient.
MCMC is a simulation-based estimation method that produces dependent draws from
a distribution f, which form an Ergodic Markov chain whose stationary distribution is f.
In estimating SV models, we ﬁrst discretize the models to eliminate the problem of
discrete observations for a continuous model. Then Bayesian statistics computes the poste-
rior distributions of the parameters and latent variables conditional on the data. Johannes
and Polson (2003) explain how MCMC eﬃciently simulates from these posteriors. MCMC
estimates the latent variables and parameters simultaneously, so it removes the need for
approximate ﬁlters and variable proxies.
MCMC eliminates maximization and long un-
conditional state variable simulations and only simulates through the conditional posterior
distributions. Hence, it is usually computationally very fast. Also, MCMC naturally decom-
poses the impact of jumps and the diﬀusion.
In this dissertation we use four SV models. We ﬁrst attempted to use the two most
common stochastic volatility models for our applications: the Stochastic Volatility Models
with Jumps in return (SVJ) and the Stochastic Volatility Models with Correlated Jumps
in Return and Volatility (SVCJ). As the name suggests, SVJ model only has jumps in re-
turns and assumes they are normally distributed. SVCJ includes exponentially distributed
jumps in volatility where the jumps sizes for returns and volatility are correlated. However,
the most prominent problem with these models is that they assume independent, identical
distributed jumps. When we look at the estimation results, we see clear violations of these
assumptions such as jump clustering (observing jumps in consecutive periods) and jump
reversals (observing jumps with opposite signs in consecutive periods). So to pursue new
models, we adopted the Time-Varying-Jump-Intensity SVCJ model (TVSVCJ) and the Sep-

5
arate Positive and Negative Jumps SVCJ (JPNSVCJ) model. The TVSVCJ model takes
out the assumption of independent, identical distributed (iid) jumps and instead formulates
the jump intensity as a function of the volatility. Therefore, periods with high volatility
tend to have more jumps, and jumps trigger more jumps, which are consistent with real
data observations. In the JPNSVCJ model, the positive and negative jumps are modeled
separately.
Both are exponentially distributed, but they have diﬀerent means and jump
intensities. This better reﬂects the asymmetry in positive and negative jumps than in other
models. Both positive and negative jumps then create a jump in volatility, which is also
exponentially distributed.
Although these enhanced models aim at overcoming caveats of the previous models,
they come with extra parameters to estimate, or they include indirect simulations that
add to computation time. Therefore, one of the central questions in the SV literature is to
judge whether sophisticated models do improve model ﬁt, making them worth the additional
estimation burden. Many authors have tried to come up with methods to deal with this
problem (Eraker, 2004; Vo, 2011). In this dissertation we show that some of these suggested
methods are not theoretically correct and have been falsely carried through the literature.
Instead, we propose a new model diagnostic method and use our diagnostic method to choose
the best-ﬁtted SV model for each portfolio under consideration. We then carry out our risk
analysis using the estimation results of these selected models.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In the ﬁrst chapter, we present the four SV
models used, which are the main tools of this dissertation. We then discuss our estimation
methodology, Bayesian statistics, and MCMC methods in more depth. Later, we provide
details of our empirical study, which is carried out on the 11 portfolios from stock, com-
modity and currency markets. These portfolios are Carry Trade, S&P 500, Fama-French’s
Momentum and HML (High minus Low book-to-market ratios) portfolios, Gold, DXY (dollar
index), AUD/USD, Euro/USD, USD/JPY, Long Rate Carry, Short Rate Diﬀerential Carry
(Delta Carry) portfolios. Finally, we present the estimation results of our empirical study,

6
which form the building blocks for our risk analysis.
In the second chapter, we introduce our new model diagnostic method. We show the
correctness of our proposed method, discuss the ﬂaws of some other methods used in the
literature, and empirically validate these claims through some simulation studies.
In the third chapter, we ﬁrst use our diagnostic method to ﬁnd the best-ﬁtted SV
model for each portfolio under consideration. Then we use these best-ﬁtted model estimation
results to compare the risks of the portfolios through various measures. The measures we
use are variance decompositions, skewness and kurtosis analysis, volatility percentiles, and
impact of volatility on returns. As mentioned earlier, we ﬁnd that the volatility extremes,
negative impact of volatility on returns, percent of variance due to jumps in returns and
volatilities, and negative skewness are all more pronounced for Carry Trades than for other
market portfolios.
Later, we exhibit the return, volatility and jump rolling correlations
of these portfolios to understand their relationships and how these relationships change
over time. Finally, we run a Factor Analysis on these portfolio returns and volatilities to
determine whether there are common factors deriving the riskiness or returns of the portfolios
under consideration. We ﬁnd that there are four main components deriving these portfolio
returns and two main components deriving their volatilities. Moreover, Principal Component
Analysis further suggests that there is a common factor deriving the volatilities of all the
risky assets, explaining 75% of the total variance.
Lastly, in chapter four, we develop a trading strategy, in which we ﬁrst estimate a
multivariate normal Markov switching (MS) model with all the portfolios. The common fac-
tors, stochastic volatilities, and the dynamic nature of the correlations among these portfolios
motivate us to use the Markov switching model. The estimation results conﬁrm our earlier
ﬁndings, and we observe that there are indeed switches between these portfolio correlations,
means, and variances. We ﬁnd that two states are adequate to represent these switches.
Then, at each time period, we reestimate the MS model and use these estimation results

7
to ﬁnd the optimal portfolios to invest in by the Markowitz model. Utilizing this strategy
yields a sharp ratio of 1.25, which is higher than all the input and benchmark portfolios.

Literature Review
Literature review for our work can be summarized in two categories. First is the research
on Carry Trades, in which researchers mostly try to explain the forward premium anomaly
by time varying risk factors, crash risk, or peso problems. All these papers use classical
econometric methods to obtain their ﬁndings. The second category consists of papers using
Bayesian methods and that delve into exchange rate markets. We ﬁrst summarize these
papers and state how they are similar or diﬀerent to our approach. Then we state how our
research adds on to the existing literature.
0.2.1
Carry Papers:
The roots of empirical work on testing UIP go back to Hansen and Hodrick (1980) and Fama
(1984). Since then, many authors have tried to ﬁnd explanations to the deviation from UIP
and have investigated Carry risks. Longworth (1981) and Froot and Thaler (1990) claimed
that the deviation from UIP was due to market ineﬃciencies. Krasker (1980) and Kugler
and Weder (2005) used peso and reverse-peso eﬀects to explain the UIP puzzle. Flood and
Garber (1980) and Bacchetta and Van Wincoop (2005) argued that UIP puzzle was due to
regime shifts such as slow moving investors and asset price bubbles. Shifting slightly from
the previous approaches, Bansal and Dahlquist (2000) and Lustig and Verdelhan (2005) tried
to explain the deviation from UIP and high Carry returns by risk premia. They used CAPM
models to explain Carry risks.
Looking closer to more recent research on Carry Trades, one of the most well-known
paper is written by Jurek (2008). He ﬁnds that except for the dollar neutral Carry Trade, the

8
hedged Carry Trade (using wide range of delta options) still has positive returns. He states
that the implied volatilities should be four times larger to make the hedged Carry returns
zero. Since his dollar neutral Carry returns are insigniﬁcant, he concludes that Carry returns
are a compensation for risk and dollar exposure. He also ﬁnds that future realized skewness is
correlated with past returns and risk-neutral skewness. In addition to that, the risk-neutral
skewness is positively correlated with the realized returns. His paper conﬁrms that as the
rate diﬀerentials increase, so does the skewness. We look at the eﬀect of the dollar index
on Carry Trades too, but we do so more formally by showing the high correlations in their
returns and volatility. We also investigate the skewness of Carry Trades, but we use the
correlation between returns and volatility as well as jumps to infer about this.
The next important paper is Burnside et al. (2008). They ﬁnd none of the risk factors
they consider to be signiﬁcant, and that not only unhedged but also hedged (using ATM
options) Carry Trades generate positive alpha returns.
Following Jurek (2008), Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen (2008) also ﬁnd that as
the rate diﬀerentials increase, skewness increases as well, but they also show that there is
less future realized skewness in this case. They claim that past returns negatively predict
future skewness. They regress the TED spread and VIX diﬀerentials on Carry returns and
risk reversal, and they ﬁnd that in both cases these have positive, signiﬁcant coeﬃcients.
This is supported by our ﬁnding that the VIX diﬀerential has a signiﬁcant impact on Carry
returns and volatility.
Farhi et al. (2009) focus on the risk reversals in Carry Trades claiming that they do
not predict future returns. These authors ﬁnd that the average risk reversal for Carry (over
all currencies) is negatively correlated with Carry returns.
Berge, Jorda and Taylor (2010) model the appreciation of a currency with respect
to another currency as a factor of distance from their equilibrium exchange rate, interest
rate diﬀerential, momentum and diﬀerence in price levels. They also regress VIX and VIX

9
diﬀerentials in Carry returns and ﬁnd that they are both signiﬁcant. They claim that the
forward yield curve has a predictive power of FX states.
Using a slightly diﬀerent approach Menkhoﬀet al. (2010) use global FX volatility
rather than the VIX index, and they deﬁne volatility innovations as the error term in AR(1)
of global FX volatility. Then they do a simple regression of each currency return with the
volatility innovations.
Finally, Nirei, and Sushko (2010) investigate Carry Trade returns using Bayesian
techniques. The authors look at Yen/Dollar and ﬁnd that the positive and negative jumps
show asymmetry; hence, they model the jumps as exponential dampened power law and
make the jump sizes a factor of the interest rate diﬀerential.
We model the asymmetry
in positive and negative jumps as well, but we take a very diﬀerent approach and use a
modiﬁed SVCJ model with exponentially distributed positive and negative jumps, having
separate means and jump intensities. We assume that both positive and negative jumps
create jumps in volatility, whereas these authors don’t have jumps in volatility. They show
that the Carry Trade unwinding can be explained by the Bayes-Nash equilibrium.
Despite numerous attempts on trying to explain Carry Trade risk, the above papers
cannot completely identify risk factors deriving Carry returns using classical approaches.
Also there is no substantial literature that uses Bayesian methods to explore Carry Trades.
Most Bayesian papers on exchange rate markets are applications to single currencies. Now
we brieﬂy discuss papers closest to our methodology and modeling; however, they are not
directly Carry Trade related.
0.2.2
Stochastic Volatility / Bayesian Papers:
Alizadeh, Brandt, and Diebold (2001) use a two factor stochastic volatility (SV) model and
solve it with quasi-maximum likelihood methods. One of the factors mean reverts slowly,
controlling persistence, and the other mean reverts quickly, controlling volatility of volatility.

10
They use the two factor SV model to estimate a single currency exchange rate.
Similarly, Hardiyanto (2006) uses a log SV model to estimate the Ruble/ Dollar
exchange rate using Bayesian techniques. On the other hand, Chib, Omori, and Asai (2009)
develop a multivariate Log SV model to estimate an exchange rate matrix.
Johnson (2002) also examines exchange rate volatility. He tests the eﬀect of long run
exchange rate returns on the exchange rate volatility by running a regression using Bayesian
methods. He claims that skewness is time and return dependent, and he shows that model
implied risk reversal and spot rates are almost linear.
Della Corte, Sarno, and Tsiakas (2008) use Bayesian model comparison to compare
random walk, the Monetary Fundamental Model, and Carry Trades for modelling returns
and to compare linear regression, GARCH and SV for modeling variance. They use utility
diﬀerence to ﬁnd the fees investors are willing to pay to switch to Carry Trades. They also
apply particle ﬁltering to calculate the likelihoods.
Busch et. al. (2010) plugs Implied Volatility as a regressor into realized volatility
(including jump and continuous component) and then separately regresses Implied Volatility
into the jump and continuous components. He ﬁnds it to be signiﬁcant in all three cases.
As mentioned above, the classical papers on Carry Trades fail to completely ex-
plain Carry Trade risk, and there are no substantial papers dealing with this problem using
Bayesian methods. We ﬁll in this gap and use a broad range of SV models to extensively
investigate Carry risk and its relationship with other market portfolios using Bayesian tech-
niques. We are able to remove a layer from the risks in Carry Trades by delving into its time
varying volatility and jumps, and we are also able to separate out the eﬀects of stochastic
volatility from jumps to better understand the deriving factors of Carry Trade risks.

Introduction
The main purpose of this dissertation is to analyze Carry Trade risks and compare them with
other market portfolio risks. Our main tool in achieving this goal is Stochastic Volatility
(SV) models.
SV models formulate the evolution of time-varying volatility independent of the asset
returns. This enables them to capture the random behavior of ﬁnancial markets and impose
more realistic assumptions making them empirically useful. Shephard and Andersen (2008)
detail the origins of SV models. The need for stochastic volatility as opposed to deterministic
volatility was ﬁrst realized by Mandelbrot (1963) and Fama (1965). However, the introduc-

tion of the ﬁrst SV model was made by Clark (1973), which was a discrete-time SV model.
The ﬁrst continuous-time work on SV was done by Johnson (1979), but the more widely
recognized continuous-time SV model was originated by Hull and White (1987). Although
these models gained much appreciation, the lack of a known closed form likelihood function
made them hard to estimate. Hence, they became widespread only after simulation based
inference methods were developed in the 90s.
The need for jumps in returns to address the sudden discrete changes in asset prices
rests on Merton (1976) and Bates (1996). Andersen et. al (2002) and Eraker, Johannes
and Polson (2003) (EJP) later exhibited the improvement in model ﬁt by adding jumps in
returns. EJP have further extended this model by including jumps in the volatility process,
and they showed how this is crucial in providing a better model ﬁt for equities.
One of the most common simulation based estimation method for SV models is the
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. MCMC allows one to simulate volatilities
given the return data and parameters (i.e V |Y, θ). Origins of MCMC, as described by Robert
and Casella (2011), goes back to the Monte Carlo (MC) methods developed in 1940s. MC
methods correspond to estimating expectations of variables through independent sampling.
The average of these sample draws are shown to approximate the expectation integral under
suitable conditions. Later Metropolis et. al. (1953) proposed a random walk modiﬁcation
of the MC method to improve the eﬃciency, which was generalized by Hastings (1970). The
introduction of the Cliﬀord-Hammersley theorem in early 1970s, which states that the joint
distribution of variables can be recovered from their full set of conditionals, was the main
step in the development of Gibbs sampling. However, it was formally introduced by Geman
and Geman in 1984. This completed the necessary tools for MCMC, and it started to become
widely used especially after the 90s as more papers analyzed its properties, assumptions and
Ergodic theorems (Tierney, 1994; Rosenthal, 1995; Liu et. al, 1995).
Unlike MC methods, MCMC provides an eﬃcient and ﬂexible way of generating

13
dependent samples from the conditional distributions of random variables. These samples
form a Markov chain. It is shown under the MCMC theory that these Markov chains are
Ergodic, which guarantees convergence of the chain to its limiting distribution. Moreover,
the law of large numbers and central limit theorems for Ergodic chains apply as well.
MCMC methods have especially played a central role in Bayesian statistics, which
is an inference technique that computes the distributions of unknown variables based on
observed data. In the example given above for MCMC (V |Y, θ), Bayesian method estimates
volatilities and parameters together given the data (V, θ|Y ) from their posterior distribution
P(V, θ|Y ). By making use of the Bayes’ theorem, Bayesian inference writes the posterior
distribution of variables as a product of the likelihood function and the prior distribution.
The likelihood function summarizes the information contained in the data, and the prior
distribution allows us to incorporate our ex ante knowledge about the variables of the models.
By Bayesian inference, the latent variables and parameters are estimated together, which
makes them a dominant approach for latent variable models such as the SV models.
The roots of the Bayesian tecnique, as detailed by Fienberg (2006), go back to Bayes
(1763), who is the founder of the Bayes’ theorem. His theorem was explained in more clarity
by Laplace (1774) and Jeﬀery (1931). The subjective probability concept, which is in the
core of Bayesian statistics, was ﬁrst introduced by Keynes (1921). Later Ramsey (1926)
developed this concept, and De Finetti (1937) gave a justiﬁcation of subjective probabilities
through exchangeability and prior distributions. In the 1950s Savage, who was known to be
one of the leaders of Bayesian statistics in the US, built on to their research and brought
a new approach to subjective probabilities through maximizing expected utility (Savage,
1954).
After 1960, Bayesian statistics grew in terms of number of papers and authors; how-
ever, it did not become as commonly used until the 1990s, when MCMC techniques were
fully developed. Despite the advantages of Bayesian approach explained above, they usually

14
lead to high dimensional posterior distributions and are computationally expensive. MCMC
methods overcame this diﬃculty by providing an eﬃcient way of sampling from the posterior
distributions. This was a turning point in Bayesian statistics, which became the leading ap-
proach in estimating latent variable models such as SV models and regime switching models.
In this dissertation we use SV models in examining the risks of various portfolios, and
we use Bayesian statistics to estimate these models via MCMC methods. In this chapter
we explain in detail the SV models, their modiﬁcations we use, our estimation methodology
and the empirical study we carry out. In the empirical study, we consider 11 portfolios from
currency, stock and commodity markets and estimate the SV models and their modiﬁcations
using these 11 portfolio returns. These estimation results build a foundation for our risk
analysis that will be presented in chapter 3.
1.2
SV Models
In this section, we will detail the four main square-root SV models and their modiﬁcations,
which will be at the center of this dissertation. These are Stochastic Volatility Models with
Jumps in Returns (SVJ), Stochastic Volatility Models with Correlated Jumps in Returns and
Volatility (SVCJ), SVCJ model with Time-Varying Jump Intensity (TVSVCJ) and SVCJ
model with Separate Positive and Negative Jumps in Return (JPNSVCJ). Finally, we will
describe the SVCJ models with VIX modiﬁcations, which will be used to test the eﬀect of
VIX on Carry returns and volatilities (vols).
1. SVJ:
SVJ model is one of the most commonly used SV model in the literature. It
incorporates jumps in returns in addition to the stochastic volatility term, which cor-
responds to sudden discrete changes in asset price and creates fat tails in the return

15
distribution. The continuous model is as follows:
dyt
=
µ dt + ψVt dt +
p
Vt dW y
t + Zy dNy
t
dVt
=
k(θ −Vt) dt + σv
p
Vt dW v
t
where: yt is the logarithm of asset prices, log(St). W y
t and W v
t are standard Brownian
motions with the leverage eﬀect, ρ = corr(W y
t , W v
t ). Ny
t is a Poisson process with
intensity λ and Zy
t ∼N(µy, σ2
y) is the jump size in return.
To estimate this model we will ﬁrst have to discretize it. The discrete version
then can be written as:
yt+1
=
yt + µ + ψVt +
p
Vtεy
t+1 + Zy
t+1Jy
t+1
Vt+1
=
Vt + k(θ −Vt) + σv
p
Vtεv
t+1
The ﬁrst equation is called the return equation, and the second one is the volatility
equation. µ, ψ, k, θ, σv, ρ, µy, σy, λ are the model parameters, and V, Z, J are the latent
variables of the model. And ﬁnally, εy
t and εv
t are sequentially the residuals of the return
and volatility equations, which are assumed to have a standard normal distribution.
Including jumps in addition to the diﬀusion terms is empirically found to be
crucial in representing sudden large movements in returns.
More generally, jumps
in returns are important in specifying non-persistent movements in returns. In the
absence of jumps, these sudden movements cause very large shocks, which are far from
their mean and, hence, have low observance probabilities. This disturbs the assumption
of their standard normality.
We also add the leverage eﬀect, which is the correlation between return and
volatility errors, since it is an important feature in determining skewness of returns.
The reason is that when the correlation between return and volatility shocks are pos-

16
itive, higher volatility will likely generate more positive returns, and more positive
returns will generate an increase in the volatility, thus generating more fat tails in the
positive side of returns. In contrast, a negative correlation will result in more negative
returns as volatility increases. More negative returns will have an increasing eﬀect
on volatility, hence, generating more fat tails in the negative side of returns. So, we
can see how the correlation coeﬃcient ρ (i.e. leverage eﬀect) has a determining fac-
tor on skewness. To be more speciﬁc, skewness is mostly determined by the leverage
eﬀect and the jumps in returns. The eﬀect of jumps in skewness is easy to see. In
the presence of asymmetry in jumps, more pronounced positive jumps will generate
more fat tails in the positive side of returns, and more pronounced negative jumps will
generate fatter tails in the negative side of the returns. So the mean of jump size to-
gether with the leverage eﬀect are the main factors that specify the skewness of returns.
2. SVCJ:
The SVCJ model allows for jumps in returns to induce jumps in volatility.
Hence, there is a single Poisson process deriving both return and volatility jumps,
which have correlated jump sizes. The continuous model is as follows:
dyt
=
µ dt + ψVt dt +
p
Vt dW y
t + Zy dNt
dVt
=
k(θ −Vt) dt + σv
p
Vt dW v
t + Zv dNt
The discrete model can be written as:
yt+1
=
yt + µ + ψVt +
p
Vtεy
t+1 + Zy
t+1Jt+1
Vt+1
=
Vt + k(θ −Vt) + σv
p
Vtεv
t+1 + Zv
t+1Jt+1

17
where: Zv
t ∼exp(µv) and Zy
t |Zv
t ∼N(µy + ρjZv
t , σ2
y)
Although the magnitude of jumps will be correlated by ρj, they have diﬀer-
ent distributions with separate parameters, which provides additional ﬂexibility in the
model. Diﬀerently from jumps in returns, jumps in volatility will represent the per-
sistent changes in returns. This will prevent the need for return jumps in consecutive
periods when jumps in volatility can capture the drifts in volatility levels accurately.
This is important since consecutive jumps violate the independent and identically dis-
tributed (iid) jumps assumption. Also, similar to jumps in returns, jumps in volatility
prevent the need for large shocks in volatility.
3. TVSVCJ:
Shifting slightly from SVCJ, the TVSVCJ model assumes that the jump inten-
sity is time-varying and evolves as a function of the volatility. Hence, the model is
exactly as in SVCJ, except that the Poisson process Nt has intensity λt = λ1 + λ2Vt−1
instead of a constant intensity λ.
One caveat of the SVJ and SVCJ models are that they assume jump occurrences
to be independent and identically distributed. When the estimation results are studied,
one issue that is observed very frequently is jump clustering and jump reversals, in
other words, observing multiple jumps that have same or opposite signs in consecutive
periods.
Both of these violate the iid assumption of jump occurrences since jump
intensities are usually very small (around 2%) and observing consecutive jumps has a
very low probability.
The advantage of the TVSVCJ model over the SVCJ model is that it removes
the iid assumption of jumps by making the jump intensity time-varying. The reason for
jump clustering and reversals is mostly due to the fact that jumps cause an increase in
volatility, which in return creates more jumps. TVSVCJ makes use of this observation

18
and models jump intensity as a function of the volatility. So an increase in volatility
leads to a higher jump intensity, which as a result generates more frequent jumps. This
is consistent with the actual data.
4. JPNSVCJ:
The JPNSVCJ model is designed to better reﬂect the asymmetries and skewness
of the returns by allowing the positive and negative jumps to have separate jump
intensities and jump size means. The model is as follows:
dyt
=
µ dt + ψVt dt +
p
Vt dW y
t + Zp dNp
t −Zn dNn
t
dVt
=
k(θ −Vt) dt + σv
p
Vt dW v
t + Zv( dNp
t + dNn
t )
The discrete model can be written as:
yt+1
=
yt + µ + ψVt +
p
Vtεy
t+1 + Zp
t+1Jp
t+1 −Zn
t+1Jn
t+1
Vt+1
=
Vt + k(θ −Vt) + σv
p
Vtεv
t+1 + Zv
t+1(Jp
t+1 + Jn
t+1)
where: Zv
t ∼exp(µv), Zp
t ∼exp(µp), Zn
t
∼exp(µn), Np
t is Poisson process with
intensity λp and Nn
t is a Poisson process with intensity λn.
One of the most important feature of jumps in returns is the asymmetry in
positive and negative jumps. Depending on the nature of the asset and the skewness of
its returns, either the positive or negative jumps tend to be more pronounced. Jumps
are one of the determining factors of skewness; hence, modeling the asymmetry in jumps
is also important in properly specifying the skewness of returns. The JPNSVCJ model
was created to address this issue. In our model, we have two separate jump distributions
for positive and negative jumps in returns.
They are both truncated exponentials
with diﬀerent means and jump intensities. Jumps in volatility also have truncated

19
exponential distribution with mean µv, and they are triggered by both positive and
negative jumps in returns. Hence, λv = λp + λn. We found this to be the best ﬁt to
real data, compared to having λv = λn or λv = λp. The truncations prevent observing
noise as a jump. One additional feature we include is that we do not let positive and
negative jumps occur in the same period.
This is to prevent having dysfunctional
jumps that cancel each other out.
This model diﬀers from those used previously in the literature in the following
ways. Kou and Wang (2004) use double exponential distribution with a single jump
intensity but assign any occurred jump to being positive or negative with probabilities
p and (1 −p). They do not have truncations or jumps in volatility. Madan (2007) uses
a similar model to ours by deﬁning both positive and negative jumps as separately
exponentially distributed with separate jump intensities.
However, similar to Kou
and Wang, he does not have jumps in volatility and does not impose truncations to
exponential distributed jumps.
5. SVCJ Model with Regressor Modiﬁcations to Test the VIX Eﬀect:
We tested ﬁve variations of adding the VIX index as a regressor in the SVCJ
model to see its eﬀect on portfolio returns and volatilities. These variations are:
i) VIX as a regressor in return equation

=
µ dt + ψV IXt dt +

v) ∆V IX2 as a regressor in volatility equation
dyt

The VIX index is an indicator of the market’s expectation of stock volatility
in the next 30-day period. It is measured using implied volatilities of a wide range
of options on the S&P 500, which are then annualized and expressed in percentage
points.
Adding the VIX as a regressor in the return or volatility equations enables us to
test its signiﬁcance on that portfolio’s return or volatility. When the coeﬃcient of the
VIX index is very close to zero with opposite signed estimation conﬁdence intervals,
we can conclude that it is insigniﬁcant. In contrast, if we ﬁnd the coeﬃcient to be
strictly positive or negative with the same signed estimation conﬁdence bands, we can
say that the regressor (the VIX index) has a signiﬁcant impact on the returns or the
volatility.
We will use the above formulations later (Chapter 3) to test the eﬀect of VIX

21
in Carry Trade returns and volatilities. Our purpose will be to determine whether any
of the above forms of the VIX index, which is perceived as a gauge for the general
volatility in ﬁnancial markets, has a signiﬁcant impact on Carry Trades.
1.3
Estimation Methodology
We will use Bayesian statistics and estimate the models via MCMC methods in this paper.
As mentioned in the introduction section, Bayesian inference is a statistical inference method
where the probabilities of unknown parameters and latent variables are computed conditional
on the observed data. In the SV models above, if we call the set of all parameters θ, and
latent variables (V, ξ, J), then Bayesian inference computes the probability P(V, Z, J, θ|Y ).
These probabilities are called posterior probabilities, and by using Bayes’ Theorem, it can
be shown that these conditional probabilities are the product of the likelihood function and
the prior distributions (i.e P(V, Z, J, θ|Y ) = P(Y |V, Z, J, θ)P(V, Z, J, θ)). Prior distributions
are subjective probabilities attached to the parameters or latent variables based on prior
information or belief. Bayesian inference has strong theoretical foundations. It removes the
need for calculating marginalized likelihoods and provides a way to estimate the parameters
and latent variables together. It also naturally incorporates newly arriving data, takes into
account prior belief or information and by treating parameters as unknowns, it considers
estimation risk. One caveat of Bayesian inference in the earlier periods was its computational
drawback. Most posteriors don’t have closed-form distributions, and some approximating
methods were used. However, the development of MCMC methods overcame this complexity
and made Bayesian applications practical and eﬃcient.
MCMC method, for the simulation of a distribution f, is any method producing
an Ergodic Markov chain X(t) whose stationary distribution is f (Robert & Casella, 2004).
MCMC draws samples from the joint posterior distribution of parameters and latent variables
and forms an Ergodic Markov chain from these samples. By the Ergodic property, it can be

22
shown that the limiting distribution of these samples converges to the stationary distribution
of their joint posteriors. By the Law of Large Numbers for Ergodic chains, we can show that
the averages of these samples estimate the expected value of the parameters and latent
variables given the data.
The Cliﬀord-Hammersley theorem, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Gibbs sam-
pling are the building blocks of MCMC. They make sampling from the posterior distri-
butions very simple and eﬃcient. Cliﬀord-Hammersley states that the posterior distribu-
tion of latent variables and parameters can be represented by their full set of conditional
distributions.
For the SV models this implies that instead of the high dimensional pos-
terior: P(V, Z, J, θ|Y ), we can sample sequentially from the low dimensional posteriors:
P(V |Z, J, θ, Y ), P(Z|V, J, θ, Y ), P(J|Z, V, θ, Y ) and P(θ|V, Z, J, Y ).
By the Law of Large
Numbers for Ergodic chains, we can show that the averages of these samples drawn from
the conditional distributions will converge to the expected values of these variables given the
data, i.e. limG→∞
1
G
PG
g=1(θ(g)) = E(θ|Y ).
Together with the Cliﬀord-Hammersley theorem, the use of the Metropolis-Hastings
Algorithm and Gibbs sampling adds to the simplicity of MCMC. In most cases, the condi-
tional posterior distributions are not readily known distributions that we can draw samples
from. For these unknown distributions, Metropolis-Hastings provides a sampling method
based on drawing samples from a proposal distribution. Then these draws are accepted or
rejected according to the acceptance probabilities, which are calculated using the proposal
and target densities. Gibbs sampling, on the other hand, corresponds to sampling directly
from a known posterior distribution. Once the joint posterior is broken down into low di-
mensions, for known conditional posteriors a Gibbs sampling and for the unrecognized ones,
a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be applied. This is the approach we take in our model
estimations.

1.3.1
Joint Posterior and Conditional Densities
As explained above, our aim is to sample latent variables and parameters from their joint
posterior distribution. The joint posteriors for all the four SV models considered in this
chapter are given below:
SVJ : P(V, J, Zy, θ|Y ) ∼P(Y |V, J, Zy, θ)P(V, J, Zy, θ)
SVCJ : P(V, J, Zv, Zy, θ|Y ) ∼P(Y |V, J, Zv, Zy, θ)P(V, J, Zv, Zy, θ)
TVSVCJ : P(V, J, Zv, Zy, λ1, λ2, θ|Y ) ∼P(Y |V, J, Zv, Zy, λ1, λ2, θ)P(V, J, Zv, Zy, λ1, λ2, θ)
JPNSVCJ : P(V, Jp, Jn, Zv, Zp, Zn, θ|Y ) ∼P(Y |V, Jp, Jn, Zv, Zp, Zn, θ)P(V, Jp, Jn, Zv, Zp, Zn, θ)
However, these distributions are unknown, and we cannot directly sample from them. There-
fore, we apply the Cliﬀord-Hammersley theorem to sample sequentially from the their full set
of conditionals. These conditionals are given below for the SVCJ model. It can be derived
very similarly for the other three models.

1.3.2
Sampling From the Conditional Posterior Distributions
Conditional Posteriors of Latent Variables
We now give the details of the MCMC algorithm of sampling from the above conditional
posterior distributions.

Since this posterior is not known in closed-form, we use the random walk Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm to sample volatilities. So, at each time, we draw a new candidate
volatility using the previous iteration’s draw and accept the new candidate with an
acceptance probability of:
Paccept = min
P(new|Y ) ∗q(new, old)
P(old|Y ) ∗q(old, new) , 1

where, q is the transition probabilities between the old draw and the new candidate,
and P is the posterior probability.
• Sampling Jump Times

25
Jump times are binary variables with a conditional posterior distribution for Jt = 1:
P(Jt = 1|Zv
t , Zy
t , Vt, Vt−1, θ, Y ) ∼P(Y |Jt = 1, Zv

and a posterior distribution for Jt = 0:
P(Jt = 0|Vt, Vt−1, θ, Y ) ∼P(Y |Jt = 0, Vt, Vt−1, θ)P(Vt|Vt−1, Jt = 0, θ)P(Jt = 0|θ)
∼(1 −λ) exp

..
exp

−0.5(Vt −Vt−1 −k(θ −Vt−1))2
Vt−1σ2v

Then Jt can be drawn from the Bernoulli distribution, which takes value 1 with prob-
ability:
P(Jt = 1|Zv
t , Zy
t , Vt, Vt−1, θ, Y )
P(Jt = 1|Zv
t , Zy
t , Vt, Vt−1, θ, Y ) + P(Jt = 0|Vt, Vt−1, θ, Y )
• Sampling Volatility Jump Sizes
Once a sample for Jt is drawn, if it is equal to 1, then the conditional posterior distri-
bution of the volatility jump size for time t is calculated by marginalizing the return
jump size as follows:

26
P (Zv
t |Jt = 1, Vt, Vt−1, θ, Y ) ∼

By completing the squares, we ﬁnd the posterior of Zv

where:
µz = σ2

Modiﬁcations in Latent Variable Posteriors for the other SV Models
The above derived posteriors are for the SVCJ model as we stated at the beginning of
the section. For the SVJ model, the only diﬀerence is that there are no jumps in volatility,
hence, all Zv
t = 0 in the above equations. The rest of the derivations will be the same. For
TVSVCJ, all the above formulas will be the same except P(Jt = 1|Vt−1, θ) = λ1 + λ2Vt−1.
Hence, we only need to change this in the posterior of jump times. We also marginalize
the jump times from the volatility equation for TVSVCJ. This requires a small modiﬁcation
in the volatility posterior.
Instead of P(Vt|Vt−1, Vt+1, Jt, Jt+1, Zv
t , Zy
t , Zv
t+1, Zy
t+1, θ, Y ), we
calculate
(λ1 + λ2Vt)P(Vt|Vt−1, Vt+1, Jt, Jt+1 = 1, Zv

Posterior of Zn

t can be written similar to Zp
t and Jp
t . When we complete squares
in the above equations, Zv
t , Zp

t posteriors become truncated normals. Their means and
variances can be derived similar to Zv in the SVCJ case.
Conditional Posteriors for Parameters
We again start by deriving the posteriors for the SVCJ model, and then we will show the
necessary modiﬁcations for the other three models.
• Posterior for [σv, ρ]:
Let’s call φv = σvρ, ωv = σ2
v(1 −ρ2). Then we can write the volatility equation as:
Vt+1 −Vt −k(θ −Vt) −Zv
t+1Jt+1
√Vt
= φv
(yt+1 −yt −µ −ψVt −Zy
t+1Jt+1)
√Vt

Now, if we rewrite this replacing

√Vt
= ytσ and
(yt+1−yt−µ−ψVt−Zy
t+1Jt+1)
√Vt

xtσ we get:
ytσ = φvxtσ + √ωvεv
t+1
Then, stacking up ytσ and xtσ for all t to get the matrix yσ and xσ and using conjugate
priors NIG(a, A, b/2, B/2) yield the conditional posterior: [φv, ωv] ∼N(aT , ωvAT)IG(bT/2, BT/2),
where:
AT = (x′
σxσ + A−1)−1
aT = AT(x′
σyσ + A−1a)
bT = b + T
BT = B + y′
σyσ + a′A−1a −a′

• Posterior for [k, θ]:

• Posterior for [µ, ψ]:
We can write the return equation as follows:

AT = (x′
µxµ + A−1)−1
aT = AT(x′
µyµ + A−1a)
• Posteriors for [µy, ρj, σy]:

31
The posteriors for these jump parameters are derived from the jump size equation:
Zy
t Jt = µy + ρjZv
t Jt + σyεz
t
We can write this as:
ytj = xtj[µy ρj]′ + σyεz
t
where, ytj = Zy
t Jt and xtj = [1.Jt
Zv
t Jt]. Stacking up xtj
and ytj to get matrix
xj, yj and using conjugate prior NIG(a,A,b,B) yield the posterior: ([µy ρj], σ2
y) ∼
N(aT , σ2
jAT)IG(bT, BT) where,
AT = (x′
jxj + A−1)−1
aT = AT(x′

bT = b + 0.5(
X
Jt)
BT = B + 0.5(y′
jyj + a′A−1a −a′
TA−1
T aT )
An alternative would be to sample each of these three parameters sequentially from
the jump size equation above. In that case, from the regression, µy
(ρj) will have
posterior ∼N(aT , AT), given ρj (µy). And σ2
y will have posterior ∼IG(bT, BT) as
above.
• Posterior for µv:
Using a conjugate prior ∼IG(b, B), the posterior for volatility jump size mean can be

32
derived as follows:
P(µv|Zv, J) ∼(

Modiﬁcations in Parameter Posteriors for the other SV Models
Similar to latent variables, the only diﬀerences in SVJ parameters are in the volatility
jump parameters. µv and ρj do not appear in the SVJ model; hence, all we need to do is
to replace these with zero in the above equations. Therefore, we only need to estimate nine
parameters for the SVJ model instead of 11 parameters.
TVSVCJ has the same 10 parameters SVCJ has, but instead of the jump intensity
parameter λ, TVSVCJ has two jump intensity parameters λ1 and λ2. In this case, we don’t
have conjugate priors like we did for constant λ, so we use random walk Metropolis to sample
λ1 and λ2, where posterior probability in the acceptance probability is:
P(λ1|λ2, J) =
Y
t
(λ1 + λ2Vt−1)Jt(1 −λ1 −λ2Vt−1)1−Jt
And ﬁnally, for JPNSVCJ instead of λ, µy, σy, ρj, we have λp, µp, λn, µn. The rest of the
parameters are the same (in their conditional posteriors all we need to do is to replace JtZy
t
with Jp
t Zp
t −Jn
t Zn
t and to replace the volatility jumps with (Jn
t + Jp
t )Zv
t ). The posteriors
for the jump size means µp, µn are similar to µv in SVCJ since all are assumed to be
exponentially distributed, resulting in IG posteriors. We only need to adjust the number of

34
jumps with the appropriate positive and negative jump counts as follows:
µp ∼IG(bT, BT) :
bT = b +
X
t
Jp

BT = B +

where c1, c2, c3 are the truncation points of the exponential distributions of µp, µn, µv
respectively.
The derivation of λp, λn are similar to λ; however, one thing to note is that since we
do not allow positive and negative jumps to occur at the same time, we redeﬁne the jump
intensities as shown below and assume priors on these new variables.
λp
1 = λp(1 −λn)
λn
1 = λn(1 −λp)

Empirical Study
1.4.1
Data and Summary Statistics
As mentioned in the introduction, our main purpose in this paper is to understand Carry
Trade risks and compare these with other market portfolio risks from the currency, stock
and commodity markets. These 11 portfolios under consideration are: Carry Trade Portfolio
(consisting of G10 currencies), S&P 500, Fama’s Momentum (MOM), HML (High minus
Low) portfolios, Gold, DXY (Dollar Index), AUD/USD, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, Long Rate
Carry Trade, Delta Short Rate Carry Trade Portfolios. Therefore, in our empirical study, we
estimate all four SV models introduced in this chapter (SVJ, SVCJ, TVSVCJ, JPNSVCJ)
using these 11 portfolios. Our aim is to compare these portfolio risks based on the model
estimation results.
So in the next chapter, we will select the best-ﬁtted model for each
portfolio, and later we will use various measures to compare their risks based on the selected
models’ estimation results.
We estimate the models using daily returns for all portfolios. We collect the data
from Global Financial Data, ranging from January 1987 to May 2010 (we collect data on
MOM and HML portfolios from Fama-French’s website: French, 2010). This yields 5802
daily observations. We also collect the VIX index data for the same time period from the
Chicago Board Options Exchange.
For all three Carry portfolios we follow the calculations of Ang and Chen (2010).
For Carry Trade returns we use G10 currencies, where Mark is replaced with Euro after
December 1998. Canada is included to the portfolio after ’90 and New Zealand after 2003
since we do not have data on their interest rates before these periods. Exchange rates are
in terms of dollar prices of one unit of the foreign currency. We use three month Libor rates
for the short term interest rates. We take long-short positions that have zero net value.
To do this, we buy the three highest interest rate currencies and sell the three lowest with

36
equal weights. Rebalancing is done daily. We take the perspective of a US investor; hence,
the proﬁt from borrowing one USD at rt to purchase 1/Si
t units of foreign currency i and
depositing the proceeds at ri
t is:
Πi
t+1 = Si
t+1/Si
t(1 + ri
t) −(1 + rt)
This is called the excess return. Thus, the total proﬁt from the Carry strategy at period
t+1 is:
X
i
Πi
t+1Ci
t
where, Ci
t = 1 if currency i is longed in period t, Ci
t = −1 if it is shorted, and 0 otherwise.
For Long Rate Carry Trade Portfolio, we sort the currencies in terms of their long
term interest rates, which we use 10 year government bond yields for. And for Delta Short
Rate Carry, we sort the currencies according to their short term interest rate diﬀerentials
(the diﬀerence between the short term rate of the day and the previous day). The rest of
the calculations are same as the Carry Trade.
The descriptive statistics for the daily percent values of the 11 portfolio returns are
presented in Table 1.1. As can be seen from the table, Carry has the highest Sharp ratio,
however, our aim in this dissertation is to show the risks embedded in Carry Trades beyond
what can be seen through this simple Sharp ratio.

Priors and Posterior Estimations for Parameters
In the conditional posterior derivations above, we have mentioned the conjugate priors for
each parameter. In our empirical analysis we follow these conjugate priors. In order to
make a fair comparison among the four SV model results, we use the same priors across
all models for the same portfolio. We pick diﬀuse priors for all the parameters except the
return jump size variance in SVJ, SVCJ and TVSCVJ models, volatility jump size mean
in all models except SVJ, and positive, negative jump size means in the JPNSVCJ model.
For the return jump size variance parameter (σ2
y), we make use of the return data to form
more informative priors to be able to separate the jumps from the diﬀusion terms so that
they represent rare events. We take the maximum of nine times the variance of returns and
nine times the absolute return squared and use this as the prior mean. For the volatility
jump size mean prior (µv), we make use of the variance of returns. And, for the positive,
negative return jump size means (µp, µn), we make use of the SVCJ posterior estimations.
For all these parameters, we place adequately large variances to our priors in order not to
restrict their posteriors on the prior means. Therefore, across diﬀerent portfolios, the only

38
parameter priors we adjust are for σ2
y in the SVJ model, σ2
y and µv in the SVCJ, TVSVCJ
models, and µp, µn, µv in the JPNSVCJ model.
For the remaining parameters, the diﬀuse priors used for all portfolios and all models
are:
P([α, β]) ∼N([0.98, 0.016], [0.16, 0; 0, 0.16])
P([µ, ψ]) ∼N([0, 0], [1, 0; 0, 1])
P([ρσ, σ2(1 −ρ2)]) ∼NIG(0, 0.3, 6, 0.082)
P([µy]) ∼N(0, 5)
P([ρj]) ∼N(0, 1)
P([λ]) ∼Beta(2, 40)
P([σ2
y]) ∼IG
P([µv]) ∼IG
The 5th, 50th and 95th percentile values of these priors are presented in Table 1.2.

The few diﬀerences for some models are listed here. For the SVJ model, we do not
have ρj and µv parameters, hence, do not have these priors. For the TVSVCJ model, we
sample λ1 and λ2 by a Metropolis step, so we do not need priors.
For the JPNSVCJ model, we only select the portfolios for which our prior for both
the positive (µp) and negative jumps (µn) are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than zero. The reason is
that the jump sizes in JPNSVCJ are assumed to be exponentially distributed, and when we

39
have a prior which is almost zero, this causes numerical issues. Also, in such a case where
there is no substantial positive (or negative) jump, the normal distribution can well represent
the negative (or positive) jump sizes. So as we mentioned earlier, this model is useful when
there are asymmetric non zero positive and negative jumps. As mentioned above, to form
priors on the jump sizes (µp, µn), we look at the SVCJ jump size posterior estimations.
We make sure that the variance of our priors are large enough so that we don’t restrict the
jumps with the SVCJ estimates. Following this strategy, the portfolios selected to estimate
JPNSVCJ are Gold, DXY, AUD, JPY, Euro and Delta Carry.
The parameter posterior estimation results obtained using the above priors are shown
in Tables 1.3-1.13. Here, we present the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile values of the parameter
posteriors for all 11 portfolios for each SV model estimated.

A few observations worth noting are in order. The second parameter, β = 1−k, can be
interpreted as the autocorrelation of volatility. As we can see from the table, this parameter

43
decreases in value as we move from the SVJ model to the other models for all portfolios.
This can be attributed to the volatility jumps, which cause larger drifts in volatility and
the volatility mean reverts faster. The parameter α = kθ, on the other hand, can be used
to identify the changes in θ, which plays an important role in the volatility mean. The
parameter θ is derived from the α and β parameters and is listed towards the end of the
table. We can see from its values that θ decreases as we move from the SVJ model to the
other models. This is in line with our expectations since θ is the sole determining factor
of volatility mean in SVJ, whereas in the other models, jumps in volatility also enter into
picture explaining a big portion of the mean volatility, reducing the role of θ.
Parameter µ is more or less stable through diﬀerent models. However, ρ decreases
slightly in absolute terms as we move from SVJ to more sophisticated models. This is be-
cause, diﬀerently from SVJ, the volatility jumps in SVCJ, the time-varying jump intensity in
TVSVCJ, and the asymmetric jump speciﬁcation in JPNSVCJ better represent the skewness
of returns, diminishing the need for a high ρ. σv, on the other hand, is observed to be higher
for the TVSVCJ model and lower for the SVCJ model than the SVJ model. This is not
surprising since in the TVSVCJ model, the jump intensity increases as volatility elevates,
resulting in more frequent jumps. This increases the volatility further, naturally impacting
the volatility of volatility as well. And, for the SVCJ model, the addition of jumps in volatil-
ity reduces the role of the volatility diﬀusion term, decreasing the value of σv compared to
the SVJ model.
When we look into the jump parameters, we see that the mean of jump sizes and
jump intensities change for each model.
This is intuitive since all models have diﬀerent
assumptions on jump distributions. However, an important feature is that across all models
µy ∗λ for SVJ and SVCJ , µy ∗(λ1 + λ2V ) for TVSVCJ and µp ∗λp −µn ∗λn for JPNSVCJ
are approximately the same for return jumps. Similarly, µv ∗λ for SVCJ, µv ∗(λ1 + λ2V ) for
TVSVCJ and µv(λp + λn) for JPNSVCJ show proximity to each other in volatility jumps
(these values are calculated and listed at the end of the tables). This is expected since for

44
the same return data the overall impact of jumps on returns should not be very diﬀerent for
diﬀerent models.
The coeﬃcient of volatility regressor in returns, ψ, is mostly stable for diﬀerent mod-
els. However, small diﬀerences occur as the mean of volatility or jump parameters diﬀer-
entiate across models, which is in line with our expectations. The correlation coeﬃcient
between jumps in volatility and jumps in returns, ρj, is observed to be smaller in absolute
terms for the TVSVCJ model. This can be attributed to the fact that the time-varying and
volatility-dependent jump intensity partially plays the role of a correlation between volatility
and return jumps, diminishing the need for ρj. Hence, we observe smaller values for this
parameter in the TVSVCJ model.
Now we present the prior and posterior distribution plots to show that we do not
impose too restrictive priors on the parameters. We have already stated that for all the
parameters except σ2
y, µv, µp, and µn, we use diﬀuse priors. Hence, the posterior distri-
butions of these parameters are concentrated in a tiny range of their prior distributions.
This can be observed by comparing the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile values of their priors
versus posteriors presented in Tables 1.2 and 1.3-1.13. A sample from these diﬀuse prior
versus posterior distributions is also plotted in Figure 1.1. As can be seen, the posterior
percentiles have a much lower dispersion compared to their priors and are concentrated in a
small region of their prior percentiles for these parameters. Therefore, we only present some
selected prior-posterior distribution plots (Figures 1.2-1.6) for the parameters that we use
information obtained from the return data (σ2
y, µv, µp, µn).

are not restrictive, and we provide enough variance in our priors that give ﬂexibility to the

1.4.3
Latent Variable Posterior Estimations
We have so far described the data used in our empirical study, exhibited the priors and
posterior estimates for the model parameters, and shown their prior versus posterior distri-
butions. As a ﬁnal step, we now present the latent variable posterior estimations. Latent
variables are volatilities, return jump sizes, volatility jump sizes and jump occurrence prob-
abilities. For the SVJ model we do not have the volatility jumps size, and for the JPNSVCJ
model we have both positive and negative return jump sizes. Since we have 11 portfolios
in our empirical study and have used each to estimate all four SV models (with only a few
exceptions for JPNSVCJ as mentioned in the previous subsection), this gives us 167 latent
variables posteriors in total. Due to the massiveness of the latent variable set, here we only
exhibit some of the selected ones and mention them brieﬂy.
Since our main goal is to understand Carry Trade risks in this paper, we ﬁrst present
the Carry Trade latent variables for SVJ, SVCJ and TVSVCJ models (Carry was not used
to estimate JPNSVCJ since our prior on positive jumps was very small).

Carry Volatility Jump Sizes for TVSVCJ
Figure 1.14:
Carry Vol Jump Sizes for
TVSVCJ.
First, we start by pointing to the changes in the latent variable estimations across
diﬀerent models. As is evident from the volatility posterior ﬁgures (Figures 1.7-1.9), SVJ
model exhibits much lower vols than the SVCJ and TVSVCJ models. This is due to the lack
of volatility jumps in SVJ, which prevents vols to elevate quickly in times of stress. In the
SVJ model, vols only increase via the diﬀusion term; hence, elevations in vols are obtained by
small consecutive increases in volatility. So the level to which vols can reach are much lower
than what could be achieved by volatility jumps. As a consequence of this, to compensate
for the lack of volatility peaks, SVJ models usually bare more frequent and larger jumps in
returns. This can be observed from the return jump sizes in Figures 1.10-1.12. SVJ return
jump sizes are larger and have more of the small jumps, which are not seen in the other
models. The TVSVCJ model, on the other hand, shows more dense jumps than the other
models. This is because TVSVCJ jump intensity increases as vols elevate; hence, jumps
trigger more jumps, resulting in more dense jumps especially in times of continuing market
stress like the 2008 crisis. Similarly, in the volatility jump sizes (Figures 1.13-1.14), TVSVCJ
model has more of the dense, small jumps instead of very large single jumps.
Second, the volatility ﬁgures suggest that vols reach their peaks during December ’87,
April ’92, March ’95, July ’07 and the 2008 crisis. Volatility jumps support this observation
as well. The following market events are observed on these dates. After the October ’87

51
crisis, the FED lowered rates, and the dollar dropped to its lows. This resulted in mar-
ket intervention from G-7 countries in December ’87, which partially supported the dollar.
Currency vols elevated, resulting in an increase in Carry Trade vols as well. Similarly, after
the Gulf War and Soviet Unrest, the FED cut rates through ’91-’92. After the cut in April
’92, dollar vols elevated, aﬀecting Carry vols too. During March ’95, the dollar was going
through a free fall, interventions were not successful, and all currencies were very volatile.
In July ’07, home issues started to arise in the US, risky currencies such as the AUD and
NZD, which were longed in the Carry portfolio, started falling, and the Swiss Franc and
Yen, which were shorted in the Carry portfolio, started gaining value. This resulted in a
plunge in Carry returns, elevating its vol. Similarly during the 2008 crisis, due to the fall
in risky currencies and gain in safe-haven currencies, Carry returns deteriorated, peaking its
volatility.
Since the changes in latent variable estimations across diﬀerent models for the other
ten portfolios are very similar to the features we observed for Carry Trades, we will not give
the same comparison for each portfolio here. Now we show some selected latent variables
from diﬀerent portfolios for a representative model to give an intuition on the diﬀerences in
the portfolio properties. We will analyze these in detail in Chapter 3, where we compare all
the portfolios’ risk analysis and present their latent variables’ rolling correlations and factor
analysis.

MOM Volatility for TVSVCJ
Figure 1.16: MOM Volatility for TVSVCJ.

Figure 1.15 displays the volatility elevations of the S&P for the SVCJ model. The
time periods when it peaks are observed as the crash of October ’87, the Russian Crisis in
August ’98, monetary policy shifts (from the US, Japan and ECB) in April ’01, 9/11, the
break from the long lasting bear market in July ’02 and the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. These are
big ﬁnancial events in history that impacted stock markets dramatically; hence, it is not
surprising to see volatility elevations during these time periods. An interesting feature seen
in MOM vols (Figure 1.16) is that the volatility peaks to its highest during 2009, when S&P
vols start to drop after reaching their peak in 2008. This can be attributed to the positive
Momentum portfolio returns during the 2008 crisis, when all the risky portfolios were getting
a big hit. And reversely during 2009, when all the risky assets were recovering from their
losses, MOM returns plunged. The reason for this is that the loser stocks during the crisis
were ﬁnancials and highly levered stocks, which have high betas with the market and went
down a lot during the crisis period. Conversely, the winner stocks were the ones that had
low betas and did not do as poorly during the crisis. When the market reversed in 2009, the
high beta stocks, which were the losers during the crisis, gained value rapidly, resulting in
very negative returns for the Momentum portfolio (Daniel, 2011).

DXY vols (Figure 1.17) show more frequent but smaller elevations compared to other
portfolios. The most striking vol elevations occured during the ’91-’92 period, which is a time

53
when the FED cut rates multiple times after the Soviet Unrest. This resulted in a continuous
decline in the dollar. Later DXY vols peaked in September ’92, which corresponds to the
ERM crisis that resulted in volatility surges for all currencies.
Another time that DXY
vols elevate more than usual is during ’95, when the dollar went through a free fall despite
multiple central bank interventions.
An interesting feature worth noting is that we do not observe any signiﬁcant volatility
jumps in DXY after the 2000s (except the 2008 crisis)(Figure 1.18). This can be due to the
fact that before this time we observe a more volatile inﬂation ﬁgure and monetary policy,
which was what mainly aﬀected the dollar. However, especially after 2003, the monetary
policy has been more stable (for prolonged time) and has aﬀected the dollar less. Hence, the
dollar has played more of a safe-haven investment role. We can see that before 2003, the
dollar is not a remarkable safe haven. Some examples to this claim are the Soviet Unrest,
the Asia (Hong Kong) crisis in ’97, the Russian Crisis, the LTCM crisis, 9/11, the Argentina
Peso crisis. During these times, we observe a drop in the dollar, which is contrary to what we
would expect from a safe-haven currency. During these times, whenever there is an inﬂation
expectation, the dollar losses value due to fear of rate hikes, and after 2003, as the dollar
gains a more prominent role as a safe-haven currency, we observe a gain in the dollar value
in volatile times.

Figures 1.19-1.20 display Gold volatility and jumps in return for the SVCJ model. We
observe that Gold faces high volatility as well as negative jumps during the ’90-’91 Gulf War
period since after the war started, due to conﬁdence in the US, oil and gold prices started to
fall. Later in September ’99, there were inﬂationary fears, and the FED started to hike rates,
which elevated Gold vols. In February ’02, during the tech bubble, inﬂationary fears had
started growing, giving a boost to Gold prices. Hence, we see positive jumps in Gold prices
during this period. Similarly, in May ’01, gold prices soared as the FED started cutting rates,
and the dollar started plunging. Finally, during May ’06, inﬂationary fears had escalated
even though the FED had been hiking rates. More rate hikes were expected, which caused
gold to soar continuously and stocks to plummet. However, as the rate hike became certain,
and as the market digested the news, gold prices plunged, resulting in negative jumps.

AUD Volatility Jump Sizes for SVCJ
Figure 1.22: AUD Vol Jump Sizes for SVCJ.
In Figure 1.21, AUD vols exhibit many small elevations, however, we do not observe
big peaks. This is conﬁrmed by jumps in volatility (Figure 1.22). There is only one big
jump in volatility during the 2008 crisis and two small jumps in February-May ’89 and July
’07. In ’89, RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) started increasing its interventions in the
foreign exchange market substantially. Especially during May ’89, the size and frequency of
interventions were so large that the AUD dropped to its lowest levels, which caused a spike
in its volatility. In July ’07, AUD vols elevated as the home issues started arising in the
US. Other than these time periods, increases in AUD vols are due to the volatility diﬀusion

55
rather than jumps (events have transient rather than persistent impact).

Figures 1.23-1.34 show volatilities, volatility jump sizes, positive and negative return
jump sizes, and positive and negative jump probabilities of JPY and Euro for the JPNSVCJ
model. When we compare these ﬁgures with the portfolios presented earlier, it is evident
that, like AUD, JPY and Euro exhibit many small elevations in volatility instead of large
rare peaks. However, diﬀerently from AUD, JPY and Euro display very frequent but small
jumps in both returns and volatilities. Moreover, JPY has very high jump probabilities for
all these frequent jumps, whereas Euro has much lower probabilities assigned to them. To
summarize, the currency portfolios all exhibit many small elevations in volatilities rather
than big rare peaks. Among these three portfolios, AUD has the highest average volatility
but shows rare jumps. JPY and Euro, on the other hand, have lower average volatilities
but display small frequent jumps in both returns and volatilities. However, the diﬀerence
between these two currencies is that JPY demonstrates a high jump probability for all these
frequent jumps, but Euro has much lower jump occurrence probability, suggesting that on
average, JPY is expected to have more jumps in returns and volatilities.
These observations are not aﬀected by the model choice. Above we presented the
vols and volatility jump sizes of AUD for the SVCJ model. In Figures 1.35-1.36, we also
show AUD jump occurrence probabilities of positive and negative jumps in returns for the
JPNSVCJ model, to be consistent with JPY and Euro. As can be seen from the ﬁgures, our
claim holds for this model as well, and AUD jump probabilities are much smaller.

Finally, Figures 1.37-1.40 display the volatilities and return jump sizes for the Long

Carry and Delta Carry portfolios. We observe that vols of the three Carry Trade portfolios
(the original Carry Trade, Long Carry and Delta Carry) are very similar to each other.
However, although the elevation periods are almost the same for all of them, increases in
Delta Carry vols are much smaller than the other two portfolios; hence, the average vol of
Delta Carry is smaller than the others. A similar feature is seen for the return jumps as well.
Delta Carry exhibits much smaller and less frequent jumps than Long Carry. Moreover, we
see more positive jumps for Delta Carry than there is in Long Carry (their average jump
occurrence probabilities are very similar). This is an interesting observation, and more about
the properties of Delta Carry in volatile times will be mentioned in Chapter 3.

Summary
In this chapter, we have introduced the four SV models used, which are the main tools of
our risk analysis. We have also presented in detail our estimation methodology, in which
we use Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We then described our
empirical study where we estimate all four SV models using 11 portfolios from stock, currency
and commodity markets. Finally, we presented the estimation results of their parameters
and latent variables, pointing out to changes in estimations across diﬀerent models and
diﬀerences in properties of the 11 portfolios based on their estimation results.
Our main purpose in this dissertation is to reveal the risks of Carry Trades and to
compare these with other portfolio risks from currency, commodity and stock markets. The
SV model estimation results are our main tools for this risk analysis. We ﬁrst want to select
the best-ﬁtted model for each portfolio under consideration and then use the estimation
results of these selected models for the risk analysis. Hence, in the next chapter we start by
proposing a new model diagnostic method.

Chapter 2
Model Diagnostics
2.1
Introduction
Since Mandelbrot (1963) and Fama (1965), the necessity of using stochastic volatility (SV)
has been known. Clark (1973) was the ﬁrst one to model a discrete time SV model. However,
SV models have only become widespread in ﬁnancial and econometric literature in 1990s as
simulation-based estimation procedures were developed. Since then numerous SV models
and their modiﬁcations have been suggested (Shephard & Andersen, 2008).
In the ﬁrst chapter, we have introduced some of these models and their modiﬁcations.
Although each new model is aimed at overcoming caveats of previous models and contributing
to the existing literature, they usually come with extra parameters to estimate or add to the
computation time via the indirect simulations they require (such as additional Metropolis-
Hastings steps). Therefore, one of the central questions in SV literature is: do enhanced
models improve model ﬁt and better represent the data, which would make using them
worth their burden?
Many authors have tried to come up with strategies to deal with this problem (Eraker,
2004; Vo, 2011; Kim, Shephard, & Chib, 1998). The most common methods in literature to
60

61
assess model ﬁt analyze residual posteriors. The noise terms (standard Brownian motion)
are assumed to have standard normal distribution in their discretized versions. Therefore,
numerous approaches have been taken in operating on residuals in order to be able to compare
them to the standard normal distribution and infer about model ﬁt.
One of the most commonly used approach is to average residual posteriors over all
simulations, for each time period, and to compare these to the standard normal distribution
(Eraker, 2004; Zhang & King, 2008; Ignatieva, Rodrigues, & Seeger, 2010; Pollard, 2007; Li,
2011). Another method that naturally arises from the ﬁrst approach is to take the whole set
of residuals across all simulations and times and to compare them to standard normal. Vo
(2011) and Vo and Ding (2010) use a mixture of the ﬁrst and the second method.
One other common approach is to calculate the cumulative distribution functions
(CDF) of predicted returns. According to Probability Integral Transform, these values should
be uniformly distributed. Hence, these CDFs are then compared to uniform distribution to
test model ﬁt. This method is usually applied to Log SV models; however, for the square
root SV models that we use in this paper, it is more cumbersome to ﬁnd the predictive
distributions. Hence, an alternative use of CDF for residual posteriors can occur. This can
be done by calculating the residual CDFs of past returns for each time period by averaging
over all simulations. Then these CDFs can be compared to the uniform distribution.
In this paper, we argue that these methods listed above are not theoretically correct
and have been falsely carried through the literature. We present simulation results in addition
to theoretical explanations to prove our thesis, and we propose a new strategy to assess model
ﬁt.
The remainder of the chapter is organized as such. First, we present our proposed
strategy and discuss why it is correct. Then, we detail the methods listed above and explain
why they are not correct. Finally, we present simulation results of our proposed strategy
versus other methods to show how our claims work in practice, and we exhibit that our

62
strategy is not aﬀected from parameter uncertainty.
2.2
Proposed Method
Residual posteriors are the error terms implied by the model estimations.
They can be
thought of as latent variable posteriors. At every iteration and for each time period, there
is a corresponding residual, resulting in N*T residual posteriors (where N is the number of
iterations in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, and T is the sample size
of the data). To extract these residuals, at each iteration and every time period, we plug in
the corresponding parameter and latent variable estimates to the return equation (deﬁned
in Chapter 1). For the SVJ model this could be shown as follows (this is similar for other
models under consideration and can be derived with a few adjustments):
ǫ(i)
t
= yt −yt−1 −µ(i) −ψ(i)V (i)
t−1 −ρ(i)/σ(i)
v (V (i)
t
−V (i)
t−1 −k(i)(θ(i) −V (i)
t−1)) −Z(i)
t J(i)
t
q
(1 −ρ(i)2)V (i)
t−1
Hence, the resulting residual posteriors can be represented in a matrix form where rows
correspond to diﬀerent iterations and columns correspond to diﬀerent time periods:

Since in the original models the error terms are assumed to be standard normal then,
given the latent variables and parameters, each of these residual posteriors will be standard

63
normal if the models are correctly speciﬁed.
Most of the methods adopted by other researchers rely on ﬁrst operating across sim-
ulations then comparing these through time. We take a diﬀerent approach. Our proposed
method is to take the order statistics of the residual posteriors across time for each simula-
tion and then to average these ordered residuals across all simulations. We claim that for
long time series the averaged ordered residuals will have the same empirical distribution as
the standard normal.
More speciﬁcally, considering the initial residual matrix, by taking the order statistics
of residuals through time, we form a new matrix where each row is ordered in itself. Then
we average these over the columns and obtain T averaged order statistics of residuals. We
will show that the empirical distribution obtained from these T values will converge to the
standard normal distribution.

Correctness of the Proposed Method
In the previous section, we claimed that the empirical distribution of the averaged ordered
residuals will converge to the standard normal for a correctly speciﬁed model. Provided that
this claim is right, we can use this fact for model speciﬁcation purposes. If the model under
consideration ﬁts the data correctly, then the T averaged ordered residuals should be very
close to a sample from the standard normal distribution. Hence, we can test model ﬁt by
employing normality tests on these averaged order statistics. In this section, we explain why
this claim is correct.
Before going into the details of our claim, we deﬁne order statistics and list some of
their main properties:
• Order statistics X(1), X(2), ..X(n) are random variables that are formed by sorting any
given random variables X1, X2, ..Xn, in increasing order.
• The kth order statistic is the kth smallest value of the sample. Hence, in a sample of
size n, for α = k/n and q standing for the quantile, we have X(k) = qα. Therefore,
order statistics correspond to empirical quantiles.
• The distribution of each order statistic is asymptotically normal with:
O(i) ∼AN

F −1(i/T), (i/T)(1 −i/T)
T(f(F −1(i/T)))2

where F is the CDF, and f is the probability density function (PDF) of the original
random variables X1, X2, ..Xn, assuming they were independent, identically distributed
(iid).
Now we turn our attention to the properties of the averaged order statistic of residuals.
As mentioned in the previous section, given the latent variables and parameters, each residual
posterior is standard normal under the correct model. Although there is weak dependence

65
along the Markov chain (across diﬀerent iterations), the residual posteriors across time at
each iteration are iid standard normals. Hence, when we take the order statistics of residuals
across time, the original distribution in our case is the standard normal distribution (labeled
as F in the order statistic properties above).
According to our proposed method, after we take the order statistics of residuals over
time (for each row in the original residual matrix), we average these order statistics across
diﬀerent iterations of the Markov chain (the columns of the original residual matrix). Because
of the Ergodic property of the Markov chain, we can use the Law of Large Numbers and
show that each of these averaged order statistics will converge to its expectation: E(O(i)),
which is equal to F −1(i/T) (as was stated in the properties of order statistics above) i.e.:
1
G
G
X
g=1
ǫg
(i) →F −1(i/T) ∀i = 1, ..T
Hence, by applying our method, the averaged order statistics of residuals will form a set:
F −1(1/T), F −1(2/T), ...F −1(T/T) (where F is the standard normal distribution). Now, it is
evident from the Inverse Probability Integral Transform (IPIT) that when T is large enough,
this set will have the same properties as a sample from F, the standard normal distribution.
This is due to the fact that when T goes to inﬁnity, the terms (1/T), (2/T), ...(T/T) converge
to an ordered sample from the continuous uniform distribution. IPIT states that given a con-
tinuous uniform random variable U in [0,1] and an invertible function F, the random variable
X = F −1(U) has distribution F. Moreover, if U(1), U(2), ...U(n) are order statistics from the
continuous uniform distribution, then X(1) = F −1(U(1)), X(2) = F −1(U(2)), ...X(n) = F −1(U(n))
form an ordered sample from F (Gibbons & Chakraborti, 2003). Therefore, applied to our
case, when T goes to inﬁnity, the set F −1(1/T), F −1(2/T), ...F −1(T/T) becomes an ordered
sample from the distribution F, the standard normal distribution.

Empirical Veriﬁcations
To exhibit the validity of this claim for a number of diﬀerent distributions F, we simulated a
matrix of random variables drawn from standard normal, uniform, exponential, and gamma
distributions, all of which mimic the original residual matrix. We then ordered each row and
took the averages across columns. This yields T averaged order statistics, which according
to our claim above, should converge to a sample from the original distribution F. Hence, we
compared these T values to their original distributions F, using QQ-plots.

Figure 2.1 exhibit the validity our claim for the considered distributions F. When
using residuals, the only diﬀerence is the Markov chain property. In the above experiments
we have independent columns, which is not the case for Markov chains. However, by the
Ergodic property of Markov chains, we can still use the Law of Large Numbers to achieve the
same results as the independent case above. To show that the Markov Chain feature does

67
not distort the above ﬁndings, we compared the averaged order statistics obtained from our
original residual matrix with the averaged order statistics obtained from a simulated matrix
of random variables drawn from the standard normal distribution. Figures 2.2-2.4 below
show the empirical CDFs of both samples, their histograms, QQ-plots and sample plots.

Figure 2.4: Histograms of Averaged Order Statistics Obtained from the Simulated Residual Matrix and

As can be seen from the ﬁgures, the averaged order statistics obtained from our resid-
ual and simulated standard normal variables matrix are indistinguishable from each other
and form a set with the same properties as a sample from the standard normal distribution.
This supports our claim and shows that the Markov chain feature doesn’t disturb the above
properties.
Since we have shown that when the model is correctly speciﬁed, the averaged order

69
statistics of residuals will have the same properties as a sample from the standard normal,
and their empirical distribution will converge to the standard normal distribution (when T
is large), we can now use them for model diagnostics. So by applying normality tests to the
averaged ordered residuals, we can check whether the model under consideration ﬁts the data
accurately. In our applications (Chapter 3), we will mostly use this diagnostic technique to
select between competing models for a given set of data. Among these models, the one that
has averaged ordered residuals closer to normality will be our preferred model. The most
commonly used normality tests include QQ-plots, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, skewness and
kurtosis analysis.
2.4
Other Methods Used in the Literature
Next, we will delve into some other commonly used methods by researches that we have
mentioned in the introduction section. We will explain why these approaches do not work,
and then we will compare our proposed method with the other methods through some
simulation studies to show the validity of our claims empirically.
2.4.1
Using Posterior Means of Residuals
The most common method used for SV model diagnostics was introduced by Eraker, Jo-
hannes, and Polson (2003) (EJP). They suggested that the means of the residual posteriors
across simulations have a joint standard normal distribution. In other words, considering the
initial residual posterior matrix, at each time t, they average residuals over all simulations
(across columns); hence, obtaining T residual estimates. Then, they compare these T values
to normal distribution usually through QQ plots to check for model ﬁt. Many researchers
follow EJP (Eraker, 2004; Zhang & King, 2008; Ignatieva et. al, 2010; Pollard, 2007; Li,
2011).

70
We claim that this method is not theoretically correct because the averaged residuals
would not be jointly standard normal under the correct model. This is due to the fact that
each of the residual posterior in the original matrix is draws from its conditional posterior
distribution given parameters and latent variables (i.e ǫi
t ∼P(ǫt|θ, Vt, Jt, Zt, Y )). By the
Ergodic property, we can use the Central Limit Theorem and argue that the averages of
these residuals across the Markov chain (iterations) for each time period will be normally
distributed. However, for each time period, the mean of this normal distribution will depend
on the latent variables. This is because, by the Law of Large Numbers for Ergodic Markov
chains, we know that the averaged residuals across iterations will converge to the expected
value of that residual given the data, i.e.
1
G
PG
i=1(ǫi
t) →E(ǫt|Y ) ∀t. This E(ǫt|Y ) will be the
mean of the normal distribution that the averaged residuals across the Markov chain will
converge to. To ﬁnd this expectation we would need to integrate out the latent variables and
parameters: E(ǫt|Y ) =
R
E(ǫt|θ, Vt, Jt, Zt, Y )P(Vt, Jt, Zt, θ|Y )dV, dZ, dJ, dθ. However, since
the posterior distributions of the latent variables, P(Vt, Zt, Jt|Y ), will be diﬀerent for each
time period, when they are integrated out, E(ǫt|Y ) will be diﬀerent for all t as well. This
shows that the means of the normal distributions that the averaged residuals converge to
at each time period will be diﬀerent. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the joint
distribution of the set of T averaged residuals; hence, comparing them to normal distribution
will be wrong.
2.4.2
Using the Complete Set of Residuals
Another approach that follows naturally from the previous method is to compare the whole
set of residuals across time and all simulations to standard normal. In other words, con-
sidering the original residual posterior matrix, instead of any kind of averaging, all matrix
elements are taken together to form a set of size G*T. This set is then compared to stan-
dard normal. Although it is not very clear whether they are averaging the residuals across

71
simulations or not, Vo (2011) and Vo and Ding (2010) seem to follow this approach rather
than the previous one.
However, although each residual posterior (each element in the original matrix) is
standard normal, as we have mentioned before, they are not independent across diﬀerent
iterations since they form a Markov chain. So, the elements in each row (residuals across
time for the same iteration) are independent, but the rows are not independent from each
other. Therefore, because of the interdependence, the joint distribution of the whole residual
set will not be standard normal and cannot be used for model diagnostics.
2.4.3
Using Cumulative Distribution Functions for Past Returns
Kim et. al (1998) have introduced an elegant method for model diagnostics that relies on
using the predictive density function. They suggest that using data up to time t, one can
sample from the prediction density to estimate the probability that returns y2
t+1 will be less
than the observed returns yo2
t+1, which are named as ’generalized residuals’.
uM
t+1 = 1
M
M
X
j=1
P(y2
t+1 ≤yo2
t+1|V j
t+1, θ)
where, V j
t+1 are M draws from the prediction density. Under a correctly speciﬁed model,
for each time t, uM
t
converge in distribution to iid uniform random variables as M goes to
inﬁnity. They then map these uniform random variables into normal variables by the inverse
transform method. The variables nM
t
= F −1(uM
t ) are then tested for normality to infer about
model ﬁt (F is the CDF of standard normal).
The models under consideration in Kim et.
al (1998) are Log SV models.
This
simplest SV model has not been introduced in the previous chapter. The model can be

72
shown as follows:
yt+1 =
p
(Vt)ǫt+1
log(Vt+1) = α + β log(Vt) + σvǫv
t+1
This model can be written as a linear, conditional Gaussian state space model by the
following approximation:
log(yt+1) = −log(2) + log(Vt) + log(ǫ2
t+1)
Although log(ǫ2
t+1) ∼χ2
1, it can be approximated by a mixture of normals.
For Log SV models, there are various ways to calculate predictive densities. These are
using Kalman ﬁlters, particle ﬁlters, and importance sampling methods. Many researchers
have followed Kim et. al and used the generalized residuals via predictive densities for testing
Log SV models and their extensions (Lisenfeld & Richard, 2003; Krichene, 2003; Tsiakas,
2004; Gerlach & Tuyl, 2006; Durham, 2007; D’Cruz & Andersen, 2007; Asai, 2008).
Although it is more straightforward to calculate predictive densities for Log SV mod-
els, which can be transformed into a linear, conditional Gaussian model, the same is not true
for the square-root SV models with jumps, which are the focus of this paper. These mod-
els are non-linear and non-Gaussian; hence, Kalman ﬁlters cannot be used in estimations or
predictions. The only way to calculate generalized residuals is by using particle ﬁlters, which
become more cumbersome for SV models with jumps. Hence, to the best of our knowledge,
these predictive generalized residuals have not been used for square-root SV models with
jumps.
One alternative use of the cumulative distribution function for model diagnostics in
square-root SV models with jumps would be to replace the predictive returns with past
returns. This would remove the need for predictive densities; and hence, particle ﬁlters.

73
Let us call ǫq
t = yt −yt−1 generalized residuals, as above.
We want to ﬁnd the
probability P(ǫq
t ≤yo
t −yo
t−1), where the terms in the right-hand-side stand for observed
returns. We want to calculate this probability based on model estimations using information
up to time t.
Now, since the error terms for returns are known to be standard normal, ǫq
t is a normal
random variable with mean and variance determined by the SV model’s return equation. For
the SVJ model, we can write the probability of generalized residuals as:
P(ǫq
t|Y )
=
Z
P(ǫq

where φ stands for standard normal density.
In order to ﬁnd the probability P(ǫq
t ≤yo
t −yo
t−1), we need to know the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of ǫq
t. To calculate this CDF, we follow the steps detailed below:
• First, we ﬁnd the probability density function (PDF) of ǫq
t
• To ﬁnd the PDF, we approximate the continuous range of possible values ǫq
t can take
by the values x ǫ [-10:0.01:10]
• Second, we calculate the probabilities P(ǫq
t = x) for all x ǫ [-10:0.01:10]:

74
• Lastly, we use the PDF constructed to evaluate the CDF for each x ǫ [-10:0.01:10]:
Fǫq
t(x|Y ) =
x
X
i=−10
P(ǫq
t = i|Y )
Once we calculate the CDF function, we can ﬁnd P(ǫq
t ≤yo
t −yo
t−1) by searching for the
interval in [-10:0.01:10] that yo
t −yo
t−1 falls into and taking the corresponding CDF.
Now, we can repeat this procedure for every time t. Under the correct model, we
expect ut = P(ǫq
t ≤yo
t −yo
t−1) to converge in distribution to a uniform random variable.
However, we cannot take the set of ut for all t and claim that this set will have an iid
uniform distribution using probability integral transform (PIT). The reason is, PIT states
that given a set of independent random variables x1, ...xN from a distribution with a CDF
F or from independent CDFs F1, F2, ..FN, the set F1(x1), ...FN(xN) will be independently
uniformly distributed.
But in our case, the set (Fǫq
1(x1), ...Fǫq
T (xN)) is not independent.
The random variables ǫq
t are conditioned on YT = y1, ...yT for all t, hence, making their
distributions correlated. Because of this interdependency, the set of CDF values will not
be iid uniformly distributed, and we cannot use this method for model diagnostics. This
diﬀerentiates from Kim et. al’s (1998) method, which involves predictive densities. Diebold
and Gunther (1998) have shown that the predictive densities provide a factorization of the
CDFs that make the ex-ante predictive return CDFs independent. This independence makes
the uniforms ut for all t iid uniform distributed in Kim et. al’s (1998) approach.
We argued above that the three alternative methods for model diagnostics are not
theoretically correct.
We have proposed a new strategy and showed why it works.
In
summary, our method’s distinction in overcoming the main problem other approaches have
is to remove the conditionality on time by taking the order statistics of residuals.
Next, we present simulation studies to show empirically how our proposed strategy
works much better than the alternatives described above.

75
2.5
Simulation Results
As mentioned before, our method works in theory when the sample size is large enough.
Therefore, we run two sets of simulations, one for a large sample of size 5,000 and then,
to test the method on a small sample, one for a size of 200. We simulate data with the
SVJ and SV models (SV is same as SVJ except there are no jumps in returns). Then we
estimate both models using the correctly speciﬁed data, and we also estimate the SV model
using data simulated from SVJ. This yields two correctly estimated (one SVJ, one SV) and
one misspeciﬁed model (SV) estimation. We then apply the four model diagnostics detailed
above to all three model estimations. Each of these diagnostic methods test the normality
of one of the computed values below:
1. Averaged order statistics of residuals (our method)
2. Averaged residuals across iterations for all time periods
3. The whole residual set (G*T)
4. Normal inverse of the CDFs of the generalized residuals (of past returns) for all time
periods (Φ−1(u1), ...Φ−1(uT)).
Hence, we expect these values to be approximately normal for the correctly estimated
models and the misspeciﬁed model to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from normality. To show
how these diagnostic methods perform empirically, we exhibit the QQ-plots, Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests, skewness and kurtosis analysis results of the four terms listed above (each
corresponding to one of the four diagnostic methods) for all three model estimations. Our
ﬁndings support our earlier claims. We observe that according to all normality tests, our
proposed method works perfectly well in all three cases not only for large samples but also for
small samples. All the remaining three methods fail to capture the correct and misspeciﬁed
model estimations.

Figure 2.16: QQ Plot for Correctly Speciﬁed SV Model Using Method Four.
As can be seen from the QQ plots (Figures 2.5-2.16), our proposed method works very well
in capturing the correct and misspeciﬁed models. For the correctly speciﬁed SV and SVJ
models, the averaged ordered statistics’ quantiles ﬁt the normal quantiles perfectly, whereas
the misspeciﬁed model exhibits much heavier tails as expected and is obviously far from
being normal. However, the remaining three diagnostic methods fail to identify the correct
models.
Although the correctly speciﬁed models have a better ﬁt in the quantiles than

80
the misspeciﬁed models, the correct models do not exhibit ﬁt to normality either. Their
tails are far from normal. Hence, this supports our claim that under the correct model the
terms (listed at the beginning of this section) that these other diagnostic methods test the
normality of, are not theoretically normally distributed.
The QQ plots that we have presented above are all for return equation residuals.
For all models under consideration, we have the volatility equation, which has normally
distributed error terms as well.
Therefore, we can construct a similar residual posterior
matrix for the volatility residuals too. These residuals can be extracted from the volatility
equation by plugging in the latent variable and parameter estimations at each iteration and
for all time periods as follows:
ǫv(i)
t
= V (i)
t
−V (i)
t−1 −k(i)(θ(i) −V (i)
t−1) −ρ(i)σ(i)

t−1 −Z(i)
t J(i)
t )
σ(i)
v
q
(1 −ρ(i)2)V (i)

Then, applying the same diagnostic methods as above but now for the volatility

As can be seen from Figures 2.17-2.22, volatility residuals are not useful in model speciﬁca-
tion. Although the misspeciﬁed model shows slight distortion in normality compared to the
correct models, they are less distinguishable than they were for return residuals. Therefore,
in our analysis we focus on return residuals.
We next look at the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and skewness & kurtosis analysis re-
sults (Table 2.3-2.4) for each three model estimate using the four diagnostic methods. These

83
analysis are once again carried on the four terms, listed at the beginning of the chapter, that
each method tests the normality of.

Once again Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the normality for the correctly speciﬁed
models for all other three diagnostic methods, whereas for our proposed method, it does not
reject the correct models and only rejects the misspeciﬁed model as we would expect.
Similarly, although skewness results are close for all diagnostic methods, our proposed
method does much better in the kurtosis analysis. The kurtosis of the averaged order statis-
tics of residuals are very close to their normal distribution value (3) for the correct models
and far from it for the misspeciﬁed one. Especially the correct models don’t perform that
well for the remaining three methods 1.
1The terms compared to normality for all other three models are of size T. However, for the third model,
the size of the complete residual set, which is compared to standard normal, is G*T. Hence, the skewness

84
In summary, QQ plots, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and skewness and kurtosis analysis
all show that our method correctly identiﬁes the correct and misspeciﬁed models using these
normality tests. For the correct models all these tests show close proximity to normality,
whereas the misspeciﬁed model is found to be far from normal. However, for the remaining
methods, the correct models can not be identiﬁed. Both correct and misspeciﬁed models are
found to be far from normal.
2.5.2
Small Sample Results
In section 2.5.1, we have seen that for large sample sizes our proposed method is the best
in identifying the correct and misspeciﬁed models.
As was mentioned earlier, in theory
our method works well for large samples only.
So we want to check its performance on
small samples as well and see whether it still performs better than the other diagnostic
methods.
The same normality tests (QQ plots, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, skewness and
kurtosis analysis) are used for the small sample simulation results in this section.
Our sample size is 200. We again simulate data using the SVJ and SV models. Then
we estimate both models with the correctly speciﬁed models and estimate SV model using
the SVJ data. The QQ plots, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and skewness and kurtosis analysis
results are presented below.
and kurtosis conﬁdence bands and QQ plots for this model are biased, and should be interpreted together
with the performance of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

We observe from Figures 2.23-2.34 that the results of the large sample simulations
hold for small samples as well. Although there is a slight distortion in the normality of the
correctly speciﬁed models for all diagnostic methods, for our proposed method, they are still
clearly very close to normal. For all other methods, the QQ plots show heavier tails than
the normal distribution for the correct models.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test results, shown in Table 2.5, support the QQ plot
ﬁndings. The KS test for the second (averaged residuals across iterations) and the fourth
methods (inverse CDFs of generalized residuals) is correctly rejecting the misspeciﬁed model
and fails to reject the correctly speciﬁed ones. Although it is failing to reject all models for
our proposed method, when we look closely to the p-values generated by the KS test, we
observe that for our proposed method, the p-values of not rejecting the correct models are
0.999 and 1. The p-value drops to 0.06 for the misspeciﬁed model. However, for the other
methods, the correct model p-values are much smaller than one. The correct model p-values
are 0.5, 0.3 for the second method while the misspeciﬁed model is 0.01. For the fourth model
these drop to 0.25, 0.15 for correct models and 0.12 for the misspeciﬁed one. For the third
method all p-values are close to 0, and normality for all three models are rejected. So, we can
conclude that the other methods cannot identify the correct models with as high signiﬁcance
as our method does.

90
The skewness and kurtosis analysis (Table 2.6) exhibit the same results as large
sample simulations as well. Although the skewness for all four methods is very close to one
another, our method performs much better in kurtosis analysis. The correct models have
much closer kurtosis to the standard normal value (3) for our method. Hence, once again
we can conclude that our proposed method distinguishes between the correctly speciﬁed and
misspeciﬁed methods very well compared to the other diagnostic methods. Although they
all reject the normality of the misspeciﬁed model, the correct model cannot be identiﬁed as
accurately using other methods except our proposed one 2.
As a ﬁnal comparison, we carry out a simulation study where we simulate 1,000 sample
paths of size 200 from the SV model and estimate the SV model using correctly speciﬁed
data for each 1,000 sample path. We then apply the four diagnostic methods for each of
these 1,000 model estimations and run a skewness and kurtosis analysis on the four terms
listed at the beginning of this section. As a result, we obtain histograms for skewness and
kurtosis based on these 1,000 simulation paths (Figures 2.35-2.38). Our aim is to show that
our proposed method yields a skewness and kurtosis distribution, which is more centered
around the standard normal values than the other methods.
One thing to note is that we carry out this study with 200 samples because, as we
mentioned earlier, our method works much better for large sample sizes. If we can show that
it performs better than other methods in the skewness and kurtosis analysis for 200 data
points, then we know that it will perform much better for large sample sizes. Since the large
sample study with repeated simulation paths would be computationally too exhausting, we
only show the results for the small samples.
2The terms compared to normality for all other three models are of size T. However, for the third model,
the size of the complete residual set, which is compared to standard normal, is G*T. Hence, the skewness
and kurtosis conﬁdence bands and QQ plots for this model are biased, and should be interpreted together
with the performance of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

To assess the centeredness of the skewness and kurtosis distributions, for each di-

92
agnostic method we ﬁnd the 5th, 50th, 95th percentiles and standard deviations of the 1,000
samples’ skewness and kurtosis values. The results are shown in Table 2.7. As can be seen
from these results, our method has the lowest standard deviation for both skewness and
kurtosis. It also shows a much centered and less heavy tailed distribution for both skewness
and kurtosis compared to other methods. The 95th percentile values are similar for all four
methods; however, the 5th and 50th percentile values are closer to the standard normal values
for our proposed method. Hence, even with a sample size of 200, the skewness and kurtosis
analysis for 1,000 simulation paths show that our method yields a closer ﬁt to normality for
a correctly speciﬁed model than the other methods.
2.6
Parameter Uncertainty
So far we have proposed a new diagnostic method, shown that it is correct theoretically,
described some other methods used in the literature, explained why these methods do not
work, and exhibited simulation results, using both small and large samples, that support our
claims.
The ﬁnal question we want to answer is whether our method is aﬀected from param-
eter uncertainty. To answer this question, we run two sets of tests. First, we estimate the
SVJ model using simulated data from the SVJ model with a sample size of 100. Then we
only estimate the latent variables (volatility and jumps) given the true parameters for the
same sample. We present the QQ plots of the averaged order statistics of residuals for both
these estimation results in Figures 2.39-2.40. Second, we run the same study of simulating
1,000 sample paths of size 200 from the SV model as in section 4.2. We estimate the SV
model using these samples once only estimating latent variables given the true parameters
and once estimating both parameters and latent variables. We plot the histograms of the
skewness and kurtosis results for these 1,000 sample paths in Figures 2.41-2.42.

We ﬁnd that the QQ plots for estimations with and without parameter uncertainty
are indistinguishable. We observe the same from the skewness and kurtosis histograms; for
both estimation results the histograms look identical. These ﬁndings suggest that param-

94
eter uncertainty does not aﬀect the performance of our proposed method. In both cases it
identiﬁes the correctly speciﬁed models perfectly well.

Summary
In this chapter, we have introduced a new model diagnostic method, which is one of the main
contributions of this dissertation. Selecting between competing models is one of the central
questions in the SV literature as well as a crucial step for the purposes of this dissertation.
Many authors have tried to ﬁnd solutions to this problem, but in this chapter we have
shown that some of these methods suggested are not theoretically correct and have been
falsely carried through the literature. We have further exhibited the validity of our claims
by presenting simulation studies carried out on our proposed method versus other methods
in the literature.
In the next chapter, we will use our proposed diagnostic method to select the best-
ﬁtted model for each of the portfolios under consideration.
Then we will run our risk,
correlation, and Factor Analysis based on the selected models’ estimation results.

Chapter 3
Risk Analysis
3.1
Introduction
In this chapter, we delve into risk analysis of Carry Trades and compare it with some other
portfolios from currency, commodity and stock markets. The portfolios under consideration
are: S&P 500, Fama-French Momentum (MOM) and High (book-to-market ratio) Minus
Low (HML) portfolios, the Dollar Index (DXY), Gold, AUD/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/USD,
Long Carry and Delta Carry Portfolios.
In the ﬁrst chapter, we have deﬁned our main tools which are the Stochastic Volatility
Models with Jumps and their modiﬁcations.
We also estimated each of our main four
models with all 11 market portfolios to obtain parameter, jump and volatility latent variable
estimations. In the second chapter, we introduced a new diagnostic method to compare
diﬀerent models. In this chapter, we will use this diagnostic method to infer which model
ﬁts each portfolio best. Once we choose the best-ﬁtted model for each portfolio, we will use
those model estimation results (parameters and latent variables) to reveal the risks embedded
in Carry Trades and how these risks are related to other market portfolio risks.
To reveal these risks and their relationships, we will answer some of these questions:
95

96
how much of the total risk of returns is due to jumps and how much is from diﬀusion;
how much of the volatility(vol) variance is due to jumps for each portfolio; how does the
skewness estimated by the models compare for each portfolio; how do volatilities of each
market compare to each other, and how do they eﬀect returns; how are Carry volatilities and
returns related to the VIX index; how are Carry returns, volatilities, and jumps correlated
with other market portfolios, what kind of ﬁnancial events derive these correlations, and
how do these relationships change over time; when do Carry Trade jumps occur; and ﬁnally,
are there common factors deriving these market returns and volatilities, and do they change
over time.
To answer these questions we will look at: variance decompositions of returns and
volatilities, skewness and kurtosis of returns simulated using model estimations, volatility
percentiles, regressor coeﬃcient of volatility in return equation, regressor coeﬃcient of VIX
in volatility and return equations of Carry, volatility, return and jump rolling correlations,
jump analysis of Carry Trade, day to day analysis of Carry and S&P correlations, and Factor
(principal component) Analysis.
We ﬁnd that the Carry Trade consistently performs worse than other portfolios in
all these analysis.
It has the highest percent of variance due to jumps considering both
returns and volatilities. The Carry Trade has the second most negative skewness. We also
ﬁnd that it is the only portfolio with a statistically signiﬁcant negative regressor coeﬃcient
for volatility in returns, its 95th percent volatility percentile is one of the highest among
other portfolios, showing it has one of the highest volatility extreme. These observations
reveal a layer from the Carry Trade risks and show it has a more complicated risk structure
than other portfolios. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that Carry jumps mostly occur during country
speciﬁc events, whereas its jump probabilities become positively correlated to S&P jump
probabilities during big ﬁnancial events and become positively correlated to Gold and DXY
during monetary and inﬂationary shifts.

97
Grouping the 11 portfolio returns under six main factors and volatilities under four
main factors, we also conﬁrm that there are some common factors deriving these portfolio
returns and vols. PCA analysis shows that there are four main components that reduce the
overall variance of their returns, and two main components for their vols. More interestingly,
we observe that there is a single factor deriving all the risky asset volatilities that explains
75% of the total variance. These observations motivate us for the trading strategy we develop
in the next chapter, in which we use a multivariate Markov switchig model to estimate the
matrix of all 11 portfolios. Depending on the estimated state for each period, we invest
in the optimal portfolio that is chosen according to the Markowitz model using the Markov
switching model estimations. We ﬁnd that the portfolios invested for each state are consistent
with the factors suggested by the Factor Analysis.
In addition to the above analysis, we have done a sub-sample analysis in order to
test the robustness of the model estimations. We ﬁnd that the parameter estimations of the
selected models are very robust, and the conﬁdence intervals overlap for all portfolios.
3.2
Model Selection
The four Stochastic Volatility (SV) models we have used to estimate portfolios all have their
advantages as well as draw backs as discussed in Chapter one. Compared to the simplest
model, SVJ (Stochastic Volatility Model with Jumps in returns), SVCJ (Stochastic Volatil-
ity Model with Correlated Jumps in returns and volatilities) includes jumps in volatilities
to capture sudden and large elevations in volatilities. These large elevations result in ex-
treme noise terms or clustered jumps in returns for SVJ, distorting its model ﬁt. JPNSVCJ
(Stochastic Volatility Model with Separate Positive and Negative Jumps) aims at capturing
the asymmetry in positive and negative jumps. TVSVCJ (Time-Varying Stochastic Volatil-
ity Model with Correlated Jumps) removes the independent and identically distributed (iid)
assumption of jumps and models the jump intensity as a function of the volatility. This over-

98
comes the issue with clustered jumps (or jump reversals), which disturbs the iid assumption
in all previous three models.
However, the improved models don’t come for free, as we move from SVJ to TVSVCJ,
the number of parameters that needs to be estimated increases. Also, for TVSVCJ, there is
an additional Metropolis-Hastings step for the jump intensity parameters, which adds to the
computation time. Therefore, for each portfolio we apply the diagnostic test to all models
to see whether improved models do indeed provide a better ﬁt than the simpler models.
As was described in the previous chapter, averaged order statistics of residuals provide
an easy way to assess about model ﬁt.
When the model correctly represents the data,
we expect the averaged order statistics of residuals to have the same empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF) as the standard normal distribution. Hence, to ﬁnd the model
that best represents each portfolio we take the following steps for each portfolio and model
pair:
• First, we order the residuals through time and take the averages of order statistics
across simulations.
• Second, we ﬁnd the skewness and kurtosis of these averaged order statistics.
• Third, we compute how diﬀerent the skewness and kurtosis are from their theoretical
(standard normal) values in terms of standard errors.
We do this by dividing the
diﬀerence between the observed skewness and kurtosis and the theoretical values with
the standard errors of skewness and kurtosis. These standard errors are 0.032 and
0.064 respectively for the given number of data in our portfolios.
• We also apply a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess weather we can reject the standard
normality of some models.
To select the best-ﬁt model:

99
• We ﬁnd the model that has the lowest standard error diﬀerence of skewness and kurtosis
from theoretical values for each portfolio.
• We eliminate the models that are more than 1.5 standard errors further from the model
with the lowest standard errors.
• We also eliminate the models that are rejected by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using
5% signiﬁcance.
• Once all these eliminations are made, among the remaining models, we favor for the
simpler model (which has the lowest number of parameters to estimate, in our case the
order of models from the most simple is: SVJ, SVCJ, JPNSVCJ, TVSVCJ)
• However, when we have SVJ, SVCJ or JPNSVCJ as a favored model, we apply a second
test which is testing for jump clusters and jump reversals. Since these models assume
independent and identically distributed jumps, jump clustering and reversals violate
the model assumption, suggesting the model is not a very good ﬁt for the data.
• Finally, if the simpler models pass the jump clustering and reversal tests, we select the
simpler model. If they fail, then we select TVSVCJ given that it was not eliminated
in the previous steps.

Table 3.1 shows the number of standard errors skewness and kurtosis of each model’s
averaged order statistics is away from the standard normal values. In addition to that, the
Kol-Smir result shows whether Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the normality of this model,
where one indicates rejection and zero otherwise. The p-value indicates the probability of
observing these averaged order statistics given they have a standard normal distribution.
According to these outputs, we follow the steps outlined above for each portfolio:
For the portfolios that have negligible positive or negative jumps, hence, are not used
to estimate the JPNSVCJ model 1:
• Carry: Among all models, the lowest standard error of kurtosis is 1.57. So we eliminate
SVJ, which has a kurtosis standard error of 3.26, more than 1.5 standard errors higher
than 1.57.
Among SVCJ and TVSVCJ, the diﬀerences between the skewness and
kurtosis standard errors are less than 1.5. Moreover, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test cannot
reject either of these models. However, SVCJ model exhibits jump clusterings during
both August, 16 1991 and February 28, 2008; hence, we select TVSVCJ model for
Carry.
• S&P: Since all skewness and kurtosis standard errors are within the 1.5 range from
each other, and we cannot reject any models according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
we test for jump clustering starting from the simplest model. SVJ exhibits two jumps
in one week during the October 1987 crisis and jumps in consecutive days on October
27, 1997. However, SVCJ takes care of these, and we do not observe any jump clusters
for SVCJ. Hence, SVCJ is the selected model for S&P.
• MOM: The smallest kurtosis standard error is 0.64. We can eliminate SVJ since its
kurtosis standard error is 2.23, more than 1.5 higher than 0.64. Hence, among SVCJ
1JPNSVCJ assumes that both positive and negative jumps are exponentially distributed. Hence, when
the prior for the mean of these jumps which has Gamma distribution (conjugate prior), the jump posteriors
which are drawn from truncated normal distribution runs into numerical errors. Therefore, we use JPNSVCJ
for portfolios for which we have jump mean priors signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than zero.

102
and TVSVCJ, we test for jump clusters since we cannot reject either of them using
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We ﬁnd that SVCJ displays two jumps within three days
during October 87 crisis, two consecutive jumps on October 10, 2008, and two jumps
in the same week on February 2009. Therefore, we select TVSVCJ model for MOM.
• HML: Similar to S&P, all three models have skewness and kurtosis standard errors
within the 1.5 range, and we cannot reject any models based on the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test. So we look for jump clusterings and ﬁnd that both SVJ and SVCJ bear
jump clusters. For SVJ, there are consecutive jumps on October 27, 1997, and for
SVCJ there are consecutive jumps during the October 1987 crisis and two jumps in
the same week during April 1999. Hence, we select TVSVCJ model for HML.
• Long Carry: Like HML and S&P, all three models that have been estimated by
Long Carry have skewness and kurtosis standard errors within the 1.5 range, and
none of them can be rejected by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Hence, we check for jump
clusterings starting from SVJ. We observe three consecutive jumps during the October
’87 crisis, two jumps in the same week in January 1992, and two jumps on consecutive
days in March 2004. Similarly, we ﬁnd consecutive jumps on August 26, 1998, two
jumps in the same week during August 2008, and October 2008 for SVCJ. Therefore,
we select TVSVCJ for Long Carry.
For portfolios with signiﬁcant positive and negative jumps, hence, are used to estimate
JPNSVCJ:
• Gold: As the smallest standard error of kurtosis is 3.14 for SVJ, we can eliminate
TVSVCJ and JPNSVCJ models which have 5 and 5.09 standard errors respectively.
SVJ and SVCJ both have skewness and kurtosis standard errors within 1.5 range, and
neither can be rejected by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, so we look at their jump clusters.
Although both have jump clusterings, SVCJ overcomes most of the clusterings SVJ

103
exhibits. SVJ has two jumps in the same week for seven diﬀerent time periods, jumps
on consecutive days at three dates, and has four consecutive jumps on one time period.
SVCJ has two and three consecutive jumps on two diﬀerent dates and has jumps on
the same week for four time periods. Hence, we prefer SVCJ to SVJ for Gold.
• DXY: Although all four models have both skewness and kurtosis standard errors
within the 1.5 range, we can reject SVCJ since it has a p-value lower than 0.05. Among
the other three models, we favor the simplest one, which is SVJ. We test for jump
clustering, and we ﬁnd that SVJ does not have any jump clustering or reversals. Hence,
we select SVJ for DXY.
• AUD: The lowest kurtosis standard error observed is 2.29 for SVJ. This eliminates
JPNSVCJ, which has a kurtosis standard error of 3.79. Among the three remaining
models, we cannot discard any by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For this reason, we
favor SVJ; we check for jump clusterings and do not ﬁnd any, so we select SVJ for
AUD.
• JPY: The lowest standard error of kurtosis is 1.21 for SVJ, so we can eliminate
TVSVCJ, which has 2.75 and SVCJ, which has 2.7 standard errors of kurtosis. Between
SVJ and JPNSVCJ, we cannot eliminate any by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However,
SVJ exhibits two jumps in the same week for six diﬀerent periods and has consecutive
jumps in three diﬀerent times. JPNSVCJ reduces these jump clusterings, and there
are only three times in which there are two jumps in the same week and three times
where there are consecutive jumps. Therefore, we select JPNSVCJ for JPY.
• Euro: All four models show skewness and kurtosis standard errors that are within
the 1.5 range. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test cannot reject any of the four models either,
so we favor SVJ. However, for both SVJ and SVCJ we observe clustered jumps in
August 1991, during the Soviet Unrest.
However, JPNSVCJ does not exhibit any
jump clusterings. Hence, we select JPNSVCJ for Euro.

104
• Delta Carry: The lowest kurtosis standard error is 2.11 for Delta Carry; therefore, we
can eliminate SVCJ and TVSVCJ, which have 4.07 and 4.75 kurtosis standard errors
respectively. We cannot rule out either SVJ or JPNSVCJ by Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, so we check for jump clusterings. We ﬁnd that SVJ has two jumps in the same
week for ﬁve diﬀerent time periods and also exhibits consecutive jumps in one period,
whereas JPNSVCJ only has one time period with two jumps in the same week. Hence,
we select JPNSVCJ for Delta Carry.
In summary, the chosen models for each portfolio are: TVSVCJ for Carry, MOM,
HML, Long Carry; SVJ for DXY, AUD; SVCJ for S&P, Gold; JPNSVCJ for Delta Carry,
Euro and JPY.
From now on, we will carry out the risk analysis for each portfolio based on the
selected model estimations.
3.3
Subperiod Analysis
Before presenting the risk analysis results, we want to check whether our model estimations
are persistent over diﬀerent time periods. In order to make reliable judgements about the
riskiness of the portfolios, we need to have robust parameter estimations.
To check for
robustness, we estimated all the selected models (for each portfolio) using the full data
sample (from 1987 to 2010) and using sub-period data, excluding the latest crisis (1987 to
2007). Since the crisis was the most extreme period where the long-run parameters were
most distorted, our intuition is that, if the parameters are consistent with and without the
crisis period, then these model parameter estimations are robust, and the risk analysis will
reﬂect the long-run behavior of the portfolios.
Once we estimate the models with these two diﬀerent data sets, we compare the 5th
and 95th percent conﬁdence bands of the parameter estimations, and we assume robustness

105
if these conﬁdence bands overlap. We conclude otherwise if there is no overlap.

Figure 3.3: Conﬁdence bands for parameter ρ.
As presented in Table 3.2, and illustrated in Figures 3.1-3.3 (for some of the param-
eters), there are big overlaps in all parameter conﬁdence bands for all portfolios. The only
exception is for parameters α and β in Delta Carry (however, the remaining 9 parameters

108
pass our robustness test). The conﬁdence bands for these parameters are adherent without
any overlaps in this portfolio. For the remaining 10 portfolios all parameters pass our ro-
bustness test. Hence, we can comfortably use the full sample estimations to infer about the
riskiness of the portfolios.
3.4
Variance Decomposition
Jumps are rare events that can cause extreme losses. For instance, for stocks, a single jump
can wipe out about 20% of the returns and can elevate the volatility by 10%. Therefore, it
is important to understand how much of the total risk is coming from these rare extreme
events. We follow Eraker, Johannes and Polson (2003) in decomposing the total variance
of returns and volatility into its jump and diﬀusion parts. To reveal the role of jumps in
the riskiness of Carry Trades compared to other market portfolios, we ﬁnd the return and
volatility variance decompositions of all portfolios for the corresponding selected models.
The variance decompositions for returns are computed as follows for each of the models:
SV J :
(µ2
j + σ2
j )λ
(µ2
j + σ2
j)λ + V
SV CJ :
((µj + ρjµv)2 + σ2
j)λ
((µj + ρjµv)2 + σ2
j)λ + V
TV SV CJ :
((µj + ρjµv)2 + σ2
j )(λ1 + λ2V )
((µj + ρjµv)2 + σ2
j )(λ1 + λ2V ) + V

109
JPNSV CJ :
λ1(2µ2
1) + λ2(2µ2
2)
λ1(2µ2
1) + λ2(2µ2
2) + V
Variance decompositions for volatilities are computed as:
SV CJ :
λ(2µ2
v)
λ(2µ2
v) + σ2
vV
TV SV CJ :
(λ1 + λ2V )(2µ2
v)
(λ1 + λ2V )(2µ2
v) + σ2
vV
JPNSV CJ :
(λ1 + λ2)(2µ2
v)
(λ1 + λ2)(2µ2v) + σ2vV
Since there are no jumps in volatilities for SVJ model, we do not have a volatility variance
decomposition for this model.
Return and variance decompositions for all portfolios are computed for their selected
models.

As can be clearly seen from Table 3.3, considering both returns and volatilities, Carry
Trade portfolio has the highest variance decomposition on average.
For return variance
decompositions, the percent of total risk due to jumps is largest for JPY and Gold. Carry
and Long Carry have approximately the same percent of risk coming from jumps and are
the next highest after Gold and JPY. For volatility variance decompositions, Carry is still
one of the portfolios with the highest percent of variance due to jumps. Momentum, which
had a much lower return variance decomposition than Carry, has the largest percentage
of volatility variance decomposition. Carry and HML have very close vol decompositions
and are the second highest after MOM. On the other hand, Gold and JPY which had the
highest return variance decompositions have much lower volatility variance decompositions,
and HML, which has the second highest volatility variance decomposition, has a much lower
return variance decomposition.
In short, the few portfolios that have a higher return variance decomposition than
Carry have a much lower volatility variance decomposition, and the few portfolios that have a
higher volatility decomposition than Carry have a much lower return variance decomposition.
Hence, Carry is the only portfolio that consistently has one of the highest return as well as

111
volatility variance decompositions. This shows that in the overall portfolio risk, jumps play
the biggest role for Carry Trade.
In other words, we expect most of the deviation from expected return in Carry to be
due to rare extreme losses (from return or vol jumps). For other portfolios, we expect these
deviations to occur less from these extreme events and more from consecutive losses due to
small volatility elevations. This is important in forming portfolio decisions since, whereas a
single jump can wipe out about 20% of the return, and they are hard to predict, volatility
elevations can be captured via some signals, which can allow getting out of the position.
3.5
Skewness and Kurtosis Analysis
Skewness is a measure of asymmetry in the probability distribution of a variable. A negative
skew indicates that the left tail of the distribution is longer, therefore, we can observe more
negative values than positive values in absolute terms. Kurtosis, on the other hand, measures
heavy tails and peakedness of a distribution. Hence, it shows how much of the variance is
due to infrequent large deviations. Skewness and kurtosis are important in comparing the
riskiness of portfolios since higher negative skewness for returns indicates a higher possibility
of observing big losses in returns. Higher kurtosis, on the other hand, both implies a higher
peakedness and suggests that observing extreme returns are more probable. For this reason,
in this section we compare the conditional skewness and kurtosis of all portfolios. As opposed
to the unconditional skewness and kurtosis, the model implied (conditional) ones provide
information on what skewness and kurtosis values are likely to be found in a ﬁnite sample
data instead of what is observed in a chosen sample.
Das and Sundaram (1997) provide closed forms to calculate the skewness and kurtosis
of SVJ models for two special cases. The ﬁrst one is without correlated errors but including
jumps in returns, and the second speacial case is having correlated errors but excluding

112
jumps. Jiang (2002) combines these two special cases and includes additional features to
the SVJ model, introducing a closed-form solution for skewness and kurtosis. However, one
caveat of this closed form expression is that it does not account for parameter uncertainty.
The second draw-back of using these closed forms in our case is that as we move from the
simplest SVJ to more complicated models such as JPNSVCJ and TVSVCJ, these formulas
become unmanageable. Hence, in our analysis we take the simulation approach, which is
commonly used in literature (Johannes, 2000; Han, 2007), to ﬁnd the skewness and kurtosis
of each portfolio implied by the selected model results.
The skewness and kurtosis, conditional on the model estimations, can be found by
simulating portfolio returns given the parameter posteriors of the models.
P(yT+1|YT) =
Z
P(yT+1|θ, VT, JT+1, ZT+1)P(VT, JT+1, ZT+1|θ)P(θ|YT)dθdJT+1dZT+1dVT
We can approximate the above integral with the MCMC parameter outputs. To do this,
we use the parameter estimations from the last 5,000 iterations.
Because there is both
parameter and latent variable uncertainty, for each parameter estimation, we simulate 100
latent variables and ﬁnd the corresponding simulated returns. We repeat this procedure
for ten-day returns. As a result, for each 10 time periods (T+1, T+2,..T+10, where T is
our sample size, 5802), using 5,000 iterations’ parameter estimates, we simulate 100 latent
variables, and using those parameters and simulated latent variables, we simulate portfolio
returns. This procedure yields 5,000*100 simulated returns for each 10 time periods. Now,
we can estimate the skewness and kurtosis of returns implied by the models by calculating
the skewness and kurtosis of 5,000*100 simulated returns for all 10 periods. This is useful
in interpreting how the skewness and kurtosis is estimated to change as we move further in
the future (due to the nature of the models, all the features might not kick in immediately,
hence, all time period skewness and kurtosis should be considered together).
One thing to note is, for all 5,000*100 paths, we start oﬀthe simulations using the

113
long-run average volatilities. In other words, to estimate returns in T+1, we assume the
volatility at time T was the long-run expected volatility estimated by the selected model for
that portfolio. Once we start from this volatility at time T, all the preceding volatilities at
T+1 to T+10 are simulated similar to other latent variables. The reason for starting oﬀfrom
the long-run vols is because of the mean-reversion property of volatilities. If we start them
from the estimated volatilities at each iteration, we may end up initiating some portfolios
from their lowest vols and some from their highest vols.
This would lead to misleading
skewness and kurtosis results since due to mean reversion we know that both will eventually
converge to their long run averages. Therefore, for a fair comparison, these statistics should
be computed starting from their long-run average vols. The long-run average volatilities
corresponding to each model is:
SV J :
θ
SV CJ :
θ + µvλ
k
TV SV CJ :
kθ + µvλ1
k −µvλ2
JPNSV CJ :
θ + µv(λ1 + λ2)
k
The skewness and kurtosis results are presented in Tables 3.4-3.5:

As Table 3.4 suggests, considering all time periods, Carry has the second highest
negative skewness after S&P. JPY, Long Carry and MOM also have substantial negative
skewness and are listed after Carry and S&P. These results are consistent with the raw data
skewness in Table 3.6. One feature worth nothing is, although, S&P and JPY have high
negative skewness like Carry, they are pretty stable through T+1 to T+10, whereas the
skewness for Carry is expected to increase signiﬁcantly as time progresses. Actually, among
all 11 portfolios, only the expected skewness for Carry and Long Carry show substantial
continuous increases through time. Hence, once again, Carry appears as a portfolio with
one of the most negative estimated skewness, so more negative than positive returns are
expected for Carry compared to other portfolios.
To infer about the weekly return skewness, we carried out the same analysis by
simulating daily returns for T+1 to T+50. Aggregating these, we formed 10 weekly returns
and computed the skewness for 5,000*100 iterations. We obtained almost the same values as
the daily skewness. The only exception was for MOM, which showed a similar characteristic
as Carry and Long Carry, and its expected skewness increased as time progressed. Carry
still had the highest negative conditional skewness after S&P; only in the last time periods
MOM had a higher negative skewness than both Carry and S&P.
The conditional kurtosis results suggest that S&P has the highest kurtosis, followed
by JPY, Delta Carry, Gold, MOM, Long Carry and Carry, which all have very similar
kurtosis. These are consistent with the raw returns, where S&P has the highest kurtosis,
followed by MOM, Carry, Long Carry. However, a few exceptions are JPY and Gold, which
have much lower unconditional kurtosis then the model implied, and AUD, which has a lower
conditional kurtosis then the raw data suggests. We also observe that Carry, Long Carry,
Delta Carry and MOM are the only portfolios, for which the expected kurtosis increases
substantially through time.

Average Volatility Percentiles
Big losses in portfolio returns are usually either attributed to jumps in returns, or to big
elevations in volatility (possibly a jump in volatility). Therefore, as important as it is to
understand the nature of jumps for a portfolio (such as variance decompositions), it is also
crucial to know the extremes of its estimated volatility since these extremes can also cause
large negative returns.
For this reason, we compare the 5th and 95th percentiles of the
volatilities relative to their average volatility for all portfolios. Equivalently, we take the
expected volatility for each time period and then ﬁnd the 5th and 95th percentiles of these
values. We then divide these extreme points by the overall average volatility of that portfolio.
These values corresponding to the 11 portfolios are shown in Table 3.7

Again, Carry is one of the portfolios with the highest extreme volatility compared to
its average vol. Hence, this shows that Carry vols can elevate tremendously compared to
most other portfolios. The other two portfolios that have this property are MOM and HML.
This also indicates why we should not rely on Sharp ratios.
Even if the average
volatility of Carry is lower than some other portfolios (resulting in lower Sharp ratio), it
reaches to higher extremes, which is what is important in risk analysis since big losses
usually occur either due to return jumps or big volatility elevations (such as vol jumps).
Hence, Carry is more prone to big losses than other portfolios due to its extreme volatility
elevations.

117
3.7
Impact of Volatility on Portfolio Returns
As mentioned above for average volatility percentiles, jumps and volatilities are important to
understand big losses in portfolio returns. However, although jumps appear directly in the
return equation, volatilities are only a coeﬃcient of the noise term. Therefore, unlike jumps,
for which we can directly interpret their eﬀect by the jumps’ intensity and size parameters,
we cannot simply make a one-to-one relationship between the volatilities and their impact
on returns. In other words, if the average volatility of a portfolio is two times larger than
another one, we cannot conclude that the volatility of the ﬁrst portfolio will impact its return
twice as much as the second one.
Therefore, in all models, we added volatility as a regressor in the return equation.
This provides a coeﬃcient for the volatility regressor that could be directly interpreted as the
impact of volatility on portfolio returns. Since this coeﬃcient can be disturbed when there
is a jump in volatility or when the nature of jumps in returns change, to be able to make a
fair comparison between diﬀerent portfolios, we stick to the same model in estimating this
coeﬃcient for all portfolios. The estimated 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of this coeﬃcient
using the SVJ model are shown in Table 3.8.

Table 3.8 reveals a very interesting feature: among all portfolios, only Carry has both
a negative 5th and 95th percentile value, and only Delta Carry has both a positive 5th and
95th percentile value for the regressor coeﬃcient of volatility. All the other portfolios have
opposite signed 5th and 95th percentile values. In other words, for all the other portfolios,

118
the coeﬃcient of volatility is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than zero, whereas for Carry it is
signiﬁcantly negative, and for Delta Carry it is signiﬁcantly positive.
To support this result, we also look at the estimations from the SVCJ model shown
in Table 3.9.

Coeﬃcient of Carry is still signiﬁcantly negative and Delta Carry is signiﬁcantly
positive.
The only exception in this case is Long Carry, which also bares a statistically
signiﬁcant negative coeﬃcient in the SVCJ estimations. This is not surprising since Carry
and Long Carry portfolios mostly have the same currencies invested; their structure is very
similar.
This can be observed from the proximity of their variance decompositions and
skewness analysis (Sections 3.4 and 3.5).
Hence, we can conclude that only for Carry, volatility elevations have a signiﬁcant
direct negative impact on returns, and only for Delta Carry, volatile periods result in signif-
icant positive returns. We will point to this feature of Delta Carry in correlation analysis as
well (Section 3.9). We observe that S&P and Delta Carry returns bear negative correlation
during the crisis. In fact Delta Carry exhibits positive returns during the 2008 crisis, which
is a striking property for diversiﬁcation purposes. For all other portfolios, vols aﬀect returns
only through its impact on the noise term.

119
3.8
VIX Eﬀect on Carry Returns and Volatilities
The VIX index is an indicator of the market’s expectation of stock volatility in the next
30-day period. It is measured using implied volatilities of a wide range of options on S&P
500, which are then annualized and expressed in percentage points.
Although the VIX index is a measure of stock volatility, it is usually perceived as a
gauge for the overall volatility in ﬁnancial markets. That is why it is also called the ’fear
factor’. By deﬁnition, we know that the VIX index will be a signiﬁcant regressor in all
stock related portfolio returns. However, we want to know if the VIX has a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on Carry returns or if it is related to Carry volatilities as well. Therefore, we add VIX as
a regressor in return and volatility equations in a couple of diﬀerent forms, and we check
whether the regressor coeﬃcient is signiﬁcant for the Carry portfolio in any of these cases.
These formulations were described in Chapter 1 as regressor modiﬁcations, when we
introduced the SV models. The ﬁve diﬀerent forms that we add the VIX as a regressor in
the SV models are:
1. VIX as a regressor in return equation

The reason we do not have VIX as a regressor in volatility equation is because the VIX
is a gauge of volatility, whereas in SV context Vt is the variance of returns. Hence, to be
consistent in notations, we only have V IX2 variations in the volatility equation so that we
have variances in both sides.
To infer which forms of VIX have statistically signiﬁcant coeﬃcients on Carry returns
and vols, we look at the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of the regressor coeﬃcients for all the
above models. These estimation results are shown in Table 3.10.

We ﬁnd that for Carry, only the formulations in three and ﬁve have signiﬁcant VIX
coeﬃcients. Hence, only the increments in V IX2 have a signiﬁcant negative impact on Carry
returns and are statistically positively related to Carry vols. This once again conﬁrms VIX
as not only a stock market measure but an indication of the overall market volatility. This
also suggests that there could be common factors deriving stock and Carry returns and vols.
3.9
Correlation Analysis
We next look at the rolling correlations of weekly returns, volatilities and jumps of our 11
portfolios. The rolling period is chosen as 80 weeks. Our aim is to check if these portfolios
co-move, how these co-movements change over time, what events cause these changes, and
whether there are hidden relationships among portfolios that are not readily seen from return
correlations but can be captured by volatility and jump correlations. Since our main purpose
is to reveal Carry Trade risks in this paper, we mainly focus on Carry return, vol, and jump
correlations to understand how the Carry Trade portfolio is related to the other market
portfolios. However, we also examine a few interesting correlations among other portfolios
to motivate the readers for the Factor Analysis in the next section and the Multivariate
Markov Switching (MS) Model applied to the 11 portfolios in the next chapter.
Factor
Analysis searches for a few common factors that derive all the 11 portfolio returns and
volatilities; hence, showing that some of the portfolio pairs are highly positively or negatively

122
correlated through the rolling correlations conﬁrms this thesis. Moreover, in the MS model,
the mean vector and covariance matrix (therefore correlations and standard deviations) of the
11 portfolios are assumed to change as the model switches states. Again, rolling correlations
reveal how the correlations of portfolio pairs vary through time, supporting the switches in
the MS model. Stochastic volatility also emphasizes the dynamic nature of the standard
deviations of portfolio returns, hence, bolstering the switches of the covariance matrix.

Figure 3.4: Carry Return Correlations.
As can be seen from the ﬁgure, S&P and Carry returns are mostly positively
correlated. The most striking exception to this happens during the ’91-’93 period. This was
a period when interest rates were kept low to support the weak economy after the Gulf War,
thus stocks were supported by monetary policy. However, the dollar sank to record lows,

123
resulting in multiple interventions by the FED (Federal Reserve Bank), German Bundesbank
and BOJ (Bank of Japan); hence, Carry Trade was facing downward pressure by volatile
currencies.
Gold-Carry correlations are mostly positive and show an adverse character with
DXY-Carry correlations; in periods when one correlation is high the other one seems to be
low. This is intuitive since gold and the dollar tend to have a negative relationship. When
the dollar weakens, the price of gold increases since gold is denominated in US dollars. Also,
gold is used as an inﬂation protection. So during periods when there are inﬂation fears,
investors move away from investing in dollar to gold.
Carry-Momentum and Carry-DXY show an interesting feature during the 2008-
2009 period. Although most other portfolios are positively correlated during the crisis and
the recovery period, both Carry-MOM and Carry-DXY show a negative relationship at these
times. This can be attributed to the positive Momentum portfolio returns during the 2008
crisis, when all the risky portfolios (including Carry) were facing big losses. And reversely
during 2009, when all the risky assets were recovering from losses, MOM faced big losses.
The reason for this is that the loser stocks during the crisis were ﬁnancials and highly lev-
ered stocks, which have high betas with the market and went down a lot during the crisis
period. Conversely, the winner stocks were the ones that had low betas and did not do as
poorly during the crisis. When the market reversed in 2009, the high beta stocks, which
were the losers during the crisis, gained value rapidly, resulting in very negative returns for
the Momentum portfolio (Daniel, 2011). Similarly, DXY gained value during the ﬁnancial
crisis since it was seen as a safe haven and started loosing value when the market reversed
in 2009.

Figure 3.5: Carry Return Correlations.
As the ﬁgures suggest, AUD and JPY are mostly positively correlated with Carry
returns. This is expected since AUD is a relatively high interest rate currency and is usually
longed in the Carry portoﬂio. JPY, on the other hand, is a low interest rate currency and is
usually shorted in the Carry portfolio. However, since JPY is expressed in terms of its dollar
value (USD/JPY), positive returns for JPY actually means JPY is losing value against the
dollar, which corresponds to a gain in the Carry value. Hence, these returns are positively
correlated as well. The most striking exception to this is seen during the ’91-’94 period. All
three of AUD, DXY and JPY show negative correlation with Carry (JPY has a negative
correlation through ’91-’92 only). During the ’91-’92 period, after the Soviet tensions, and
after all the rate cuts in 1992, the dollar lost value, AUD depreciated after the volatile
environment caused by Soviet tensions and the ERM crisis in ’92, whereas JPY gained value
(leading to a drop in USD/JPY). The Carry portfolio shorted both AUD and JPY at this
time so Carry realized positive returns, causing negative correlations between Carry returns
and DXY, AUD, JPY returns. Later in 1994, FED hiked rates a few times, leading to a gain
in the dollar value. AUD, which was shorted in the Carry portfolio, started gaining value,

125
resulting in a loss in Carry Trade. Therefore, we observe negative correlations between Carry
versus DXY and AUD returns.
Long Rate Carry portfolio returns have very positive correlations with Carry
returns, which is not surprising since long and short term interest rates are directly related.
However, the Delta Carry portfolio seems to be less correlated with the Carry portfolio.
The correlation ﬂuctuates around zero, taking both positive and negative numbers. This can
be useful in identifying strategies to diversify the investment portfolio.
Now we look into some of the other market portfolio’s return correlations:

Figure 3.6: S&P Return Correlations.
S&P and MOM portfolios are mostly positively correlated since they are both stock
portfolios. However, two main exceptions are seen in the 2003 and 2009 period. In 2003,
after the Iraq War, since there was conﬁdence in the US, stocks started gaining the value
that they had lost during the uncertain period before the war, whereas the MOM portfolio
realized negative returns. Similarly in 2009, although stocks were recovering from their losses
during the crisis, MOM faced big losses. The reason for the MOM losses during both these
recovery periods was explained above for Carry-MOM correlations. Hence, during these time

126
periods we observe a negative correlation between the S&P 500 and MOM Portfolio returns.
HML, on the other hand, is mostly negatively correlated with S&P returns, except
during the crisis period, when they both faced big losses and their returns become positively
correlated.
DXY and S&P return correlations exhibit an interesting feature. Although they
were mostly positively correlated in the earlier periods, after 2003, they become negatively
correlated. This can be due to the fact that before 2003, we observe a more volatile inﬂation
ﬁgure and monetary policy, which was what mainly aﬀected the dollar. However, after 2003,
the monetary policy has been more stable (for prolonged time) and has aﬀected the dollar
less. Hence, the dollar has played more of a safe-haven investment role. We can see that
before 2003, the dollar is not a remarkable safe haven. Some examples to this claim are:
during the Soviet Unrest, the Asia (Hong Kong) crisis in ’97, the Russian Crisis, the LTCM
crisis, 9/11, the Argentina Peso crisis we observe a drop in the dollar, which is contrary to
what we would expect from a safe-haven currency. During these times, whenever there is
an inﬂation expectation, the dollar losses value, and stocks decline due to fear of rate hikes,
making their returns positively correlated. After 2003, as the dollar gains a more prominent
role as a safe-haven currency, we observe a gain in the dollar value in volatile times when
stocks decline, resulting in a negative correlation among their returns.
Gold returns exhibit an opposite correlation with S&P compared to DXY-S&P cor-
relations. This is due to the inverse correlation between Gold and DXY and is coherent with
their relationship with Carry returns, as described above.

Figure 3.7: Return Correlations for Various Portfolios.
AUD-S&P returns are mostly positively correlated, which is intuitive since both
are perceived as risky assets. The one striking exception is during the ’91-’92 period, when
stocks gained after the Gulf War due to conﬁdence in the US, and as the FED cut rates in ’91
and ’92. However, the AUD lost value during the volatile times of the war and after Soviet
tensions. As a result during this time period we observe a negative correlation between their
returns. Other than this time horizon, they are mostly positively correlated.
Delta Carry portfolio returns are not prominently correlated to S&P retuns, the
correlation coeﬃcient mostly ﬂuctuates around zero.
However, they become apparently
negatively correlated during the crisis period.
This is due to the fact that Delta Carry
portfolio realizes positive returns during the crisis, when all risky assets faces huge losses.
This is an important fact, which shows that Delta Carry performs well during volatile periods
and can be used as a hedging instrument.
DXY-Gold exhibits a negative correlation at almost all times. This can be explained
by their characteristics detailed earlier. When the dollar weakens, the price of gold increases
since gold is denominated in US dollars. Also, Gold is used as inﬂation protection. So during

128
periods when there are inﬂation fears, investors move away from investing in the dollar to
gold.
MOM-DXY has a pronounced positive correlation during the crisis and the recovery
period in 2009.
During the 2008 crisis, momentum portfolio had positive returns.
And
reversely during 2009, when all the risky assets were recovering from losses, the Momentum
portfolio faced big losses. The reason for this is that the loser stocks during the crisis were
ﬁnancials and highly levered stocks, which have high betas with the market and went down a
lot during the crisis period. Conversely, the winner stocks were the ones that had low betas
and did not do as poorly during the crisis. When the market reversed in 2009, the high
beta stocks, which were the losers during the crisis, gained value rapidly, resulting in very
negative returns for the Momentum portfolio. Hence, while performing well during crisis,
MOM declined in 2009.
Similarly, DXY gained value during the ﬁnancial crisis since it was seen as a safe
haven and started losing value when the market reversed in 2009. As a result we observe a
high positive correlation between DXY and MOM returns after 2008.

Figure 3.8: Return Correlations for Various Portfolios.
For Gold-AUD, we observe that although they have a positive return correlation
overall, the coeﬃcient peaks during August 2005. This is when oil prices reached their all
times highs before they started coming down in September 2005. Hence, AUD and, due to
inﬂationary worries, Gold rallied. Despite the fact that Australia is not a high oil output
country, its correlation with oil prices is generally positive. This positive relationship can be
attributed to many factors such as the following. Both oil and AUD are bets on global growth
which means demand for more raw-material (Australia is a raw-material-rich country, such
as iron, copper, zink, uranium, etc.). They are also both closely linked to China. Finally,
usually a surge in oil induces a drop in dollar (both since oil is priced in dollars and because
of inﬂationary fears), which gives a boost to AUD/USD. Because of these relationships to
oil, Gold and AUD correlations peaked during the August 2005 period. However, we observe
that during crisis, their correlation coeﬃcient plunged. This is due to the fact that rather
than an inﬂation hedge, Gold played a safe-haven role during the crisis, when all the risky
assets, AUD being one of them, got hit.
Finally, AUD-Euro does not exhibit a signiﬁcant correlation until 1999, which ad-

130
vances considerably after that time with the introduction of Euro.
3.9.2
Volatility Correlations
Volatility Correlations are important to understand whether there are common factors deriv-
ing the riskiness of portfolio pairs. Rolling correlations also provide to us how these factors
and their impact on diﬀerent portfolios change over time. This sometimes gives us extra
information that is not observed from return correlations. We might observe a negative
correlation in a portfolio pair’s returns and a positive correlation in their volatilities and
vice versa. In section 3.9.5 we will examine in detail how Carry-S&P return and volatility
correlations change over time, and what the deriving historical events to these relationships
are. We will explain what events cause an opposite or same signed correlation in their re-
turns and volatilities. First in this section, we show Carry volatility correlations and touch
on some of the other interesting volatility correlations among other portfolios.

Figure 3.9: Carry Volatility Correlations.
As the ﬁgure suggests, Carry-S&P volatilities are in general very positively corre-

131
lated. The most outstanding exception is during the ’95-’96 period. During ’95, the dollar
went through a free fall. There were multiple central bank interventions to prevent the de-
cline in the dollar; Germany cut rates; the FED ﬁrst hiked rates in ’95 and then cut them
in second half of ’95 and into ’96. Hence, currency and Carry volatilities were elevated.
However, stock vols were more stable. Then in late ’96, stocks were going through a bear
market, and their volatilities were elevated after Clinton won elections. Carry vols, on the
other hand, were more stable. Therefore, we observe a negative correlation in S&P and
Carry vols during this period.
Carry-DXY volatilities are very positively correlated as well. This is an interesting
observation because the Carry Portfolio is dollar neutral. This fact suggests the increase/
decrease in the dollar value aﬀects currencies in the Carry portfolio asymmetrically, causing
an unbalanced change in the Carry returns and that Carry is still prone to dollar risk.
Carry-Gold volatilities are also positively correlated in general, except the ’95 and
2007 periods. During ’95, due to monetary policy shifts, central bank interventions and the
free fall of the dollar, as described above, currencies and Carry vols were elevated; however,
gold prices were pretty stable during this period (Figure 3.10). In October-November 2007,
gold and oil prices were at their all time highs, but, due to fragile economy, the FED cut
rates twice in two months; hence, gold vols rocketed and the dollar droped. As a result,
Carry faced negative returns and high vols, however, not as high as Gold. These resulted
in a negative correlation between Carry-Gold vols. The high positive correlations in other
periods might be used to form more enhanced trading and hedging strategies.

Carry-AUD vols are very positively correlated as expected. AUD is a G10 currency,
and since it is a high-interest-rate currency, it is usually longed in the Carry Trade portfolio.
Hence, an increase in AUD vol results in an increase in Carry vol, making their vols very
positively correlated.

Figure 3.11: Volatility Correlations.
Carry-Long Carry and Carry-Delta Carry portfolio volatilities are highly posi-
tively correlated as we expect. Delta Carry vol has a lower correlation coeﬃcient than the
Long Carry vol, which is not surprising. As we had pointed out for the return correlations
(Section 3.9.1), Delta Carry returns are not very much correlated with Carry returns; and
Delta Carry realizes positive returns during the crisis period, which suggests that it per-
forms relatively well in volatile periods. Hence, we expect the common factors deriving the
volatilities of all Carry portfolios to have a reduced impact on Delta Carry.
S&P- MOM volatilities are positively correlated in general as well.
One small
exception is seen during the ’94-’95 period. During this period, there are multiple rate hikes
in the US, causing stock volatility to increase. We also observe negative returns in stocks,
whereas the MOM portfolio yields positive returns with a stable volatility.
Similar to Carry-Gold volatilities, S&P-Gold volatility correlations are mostly posi-
tive too, with an obvious exception during the ’94 period. As described above for S&P-MOM
volatilities, during the ’94 period, there were multiple rate hikes by the FED, resulting in
high stock volatility and negative returns. However, as can be seen from Figure 3.10, gold

134
prices were stable during ’94-’96 with a low volatility. Hence, the volatility correlations for
S&P and Gold are negative during this time.

Figure 3.12: Volatility Correlations for Various Portfolios.
AUD-S&P volatility correlations can be seen to be mostly positive, which is intuitive
since they are both considered as risky assets.
There are a few periods where their vol
correlations change sign: the ’89, ’91-’92, ’95-’96, 2003-’04 and 2006 periods. In ’89, RBA
(Reserve Bank of Australia) started increasing its interventions in the foreign exchange
market substantially. Especially during May ’89, the size and frequency of interventions
were so large that AUD dropped to its lowest levels, which caused a spike in its volatility. It
only started picking up again after August, which is when its volatility dropped to normal
levels. Hence, during this period, we observe a negative correlation between AUD and stock
vols. During ’91-’92, after the Soviet Unrest, there have been multiple rate cuts by the FED
causing stock prices to go up; however, AUD faced losses and its volatility spiked during these
volatile times. Furthermore, rate hikes in Germany in late ’91 also aﬀected AUD volatility,
which further elevated during the ERM crisis in ’92. Stocks, on the other hand, had been
more stable. Hence, S&P and AUD volatilities exhibit a negative correlation. In 1995- early

135
’96, as was explained earlier, due to central bank interventions and monetary policy shifts,
currency volatilities were elevated; however, stock vols were stable at this time. In late 2003,
due to economic concerns in the US, stocks faced negative returns and vols elevated. AUD
also depreciated during this time; however, its vol increased only slightly. In 2004, oil price
volatility escalated, which impacted AUD vol more than the stock volatilities. And ﬁnally,
in 2006, after the FED hiked rates, there was a ﬂow of investments from Australia to the US.
This caused a peak in AUD volatility, when stocks were more stable. So, their volatilities
show a negative correlation during these periods.
S&P-Delta Carry vol correlation coeﬃcients are large compared to their return
correlations. This again supports our claim that Delta Carry returns are less aﬀected from
volatile periods and perform well compared to other risky assets.
MOM-HML vols are very positively correlated; since they are both stock portfolios,
this is very natural. However, one striking exception is during the 2004 period, when their
vols became negatively correlated. This is a time when there were multiple rate hikes, and
stock volatility was elevated. MOM faced losses at this time, and its volatility elevated,
whereas HML realized positive returns, having a stable volatility.
AUD-Gold have positively correlated volatilities for most of the time; however, this
relationship breaks in 2000-2001, when AUD vol elevates due to signiﬁcant monetary shifts
in the US, Europe and Japan as well as central bank interventions. During this period, the
ECB hiked rates twice, the BOJ cut rates, the FED raised rates in 2000 multiple times and
then cut them in 2001. The ECB, BOJ and the FED coordinated an intervention for the ﬁrst
time to support the Euro, which had fallen to its all time low. Although AUD vols elevated,
Gold volatilities were relatively stable. Also, we can see that during the ’93 and 2006 period,
AUD and Gold correlations switch to being negative brieﬂy. In ’93, German Bundesbank
cut rates three times from February to April, and in April the US intervened in the markets
to support the dollar. This caused an elevation in currency vols, whereas Gold volatilities

136
were stable. On the other hand, the negative relationship in 2006 can be attributed to the
fact that after the FED hiked rates, there was a ﬂow of Australian investments to the US
that caused AUD vols to elevate. Again, Gold vols were more stable, resulting in a negative
correlation between Gold and AUD vols.
3.9.3
Jump Correlations
We next look at the jump occurrence probability correlations of Carry versus other market
portfolios. Jumps are rare events that can explain up to 20 percent of the total variance of
a portfolio. They usually result in sudden large losses or increases in returns or volatilities.
In the S&P case for instance, a single jump can cause up to a 20 percent loss in returns
or a 10 percent increase in volatility. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors
cause jumps and whether there are common factors that derive jumps for diﬀerent market
portfolios.

Figure 3.13: Carry Jump Correlations.

137
As can be seen from Figure 3.13, S&P and Carry jump probabilities become very
correlated during: the ’89-mini crash; the ’91-Soviet Unrest; the ’99-Japanese recovery (the
FED hikes in more than three years, BOJ intervenes, the ECB tightens; hence, both jump
probabilities elevate); late 2003-economic concerns in US and Europe (very low interest rates,
volatile currencies); 2005-oil prices escalate, ECB, FED are hawkish; the 2007-2008-ﬁnancial
crisis. So we observe that Carry and S&P jump probabilities become correlated during big
ﬁnancial events.
Carry-MOM correlations peaked during the August ’89 period. As was described
for S&P and AUD vol correlations, during this period, RBA intervened in the markets very
aggressively, causing a plunge in the AUD and as a result in Carry returns (AUD is longed
in the Carry portfolio at this time). Although stocks performed well during this period,
the MOM portfolio also faced big losses before the October ’89 crash. Hence, we observe a
positive correlation between Carry and MOM jump probabilities.
For DXY and Gold, their jump probability correlations with Carry peaks during
’91-’92 and ’96-’97. In 1991-’92, the FED cut rates multiple times, and Germany hiked
rates, aﬀecting the dollar and Carry. There are shifts in inﬂation expectations during the
’92 period, which also impacts Gold. Then, after the ERM crisis in ’92, Germany cut rates
and all the currency volatilities peaked, increasing both dollar and Carry jump probabilities.
In ’96-’97, again there were inﬂation fears, rate hike expectations from the FED, BOJ and
Germany as well as tensions with China and Japan on their US treasury holdings. All these
aﬀected the dollar, Gold, and Carry jump probabilities. Hence, we can see that both times
when Carry-Gold and Carry-DXY jump probability correlations peek are when there are
monetary and inﬂationary shifts.
Gold and Carry jump correlations also peaked during September ’99 and December
2004. In September ’99, there were inﬂationary fears in the market, oil prices rocketed, and
the dollar dipped. The Yen gained at this time, despite actions from BOJ. Hence, Carry faced

138
losses, gold prices surged, causing its vol to elevate and both jump probabilities increased.
In December 2004, oil prices sank to its lowest levels, dollar kept plunging due to budget
deﬁcit concerns. The AUD dipped continuously, resulting in Carry losses, Gold took a hit
as oil prices sank and as the FED hiked rates. Hence, Carry-Gold jump probabilities were
positively correlated. These support our previous observation that Gold and Carry jumps
correlations elevate during inﬂationary shifts.

Figure 3.14: Jump Correlations.
Carry and Long Carry jump probabilities have a very a high positive correlation at
almost all time periods. The only time when the coeﬃcient drops to zero is on July-August
’94. When we look at the currencies in each portfolio during this period, we observe that
although AUD is longed in the Long Carry portfolio, it is replaced by Norwegian Krona
in the Carry portfolio. The AUD is more volatile at this time period, causing Long Carry
portfolio to have nonzero jump probabilities, whereas Carry jump probabilities are zero,
breaking their very positive relationship.
Similarly, Carry and Delta Carry jump probabilities are very positively correlated,
except a break in this relationship during August 2000 to August 2001. During this time,

139
there were many monetary shifts in Europe, the US and Japan. As discussed earlier, the
ECB raised rates twice, the FED and BOJ cut rates, the ECB intervened in markets for the
ﬁrst time in accordance with the FED and the BOJ to support the Euro, which had fallen to
its all time low. Hence, interest rates were very volatile during this time, causing a constant
change in the structure of the Delta Carry portfolio and increasing its jump probability. On
the other hand, the Carry portfolio had a stable constitution and its jump probabilities were
close to zero.
Carry and AUD jump probabilities are mostly very positively correlated as expected
since the AUD is a high-interest-rate currency that is usually longed in the Carry portfolio.
However, we see a few breaks to this relationship during ’92-’95, September ’98, late 2001-
mid 2002 and mid 2006-2007. These can be attributed to the following facts. In ’92, after
the ERM crisis, Pound and other European currencies had fallen drastically, and these were
governing the Carry returns. Later in ’93-’94, AUD was either shorted or mostly out of
the Carry portfolio; only after ’95 did it start to be longed again. In September ’98, AUD
again switched from being longed in the Carry portfolio to being neutral. In late 2001-mid
2002, there was the Peso crisis in Argentina, which caused a drastic fall in the dollar. Hence,
all the currencies in the Carry portfolio started gaining against the dollar, impacting Carry
returns; therefore, the direct relationship between Carry and AUD broke at this time. After
mid 2006, the ECB tightened multiple times, aﬀecting all other European currencies as well.
Later in 2007, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand intervened in the markets for the ﬁrst time
to reduce the value of the all time high NZD, which was longed in the Carry portfolio. These
caused the Carry jump probability to elevate during 2006-2007 independent of the AUD.
When we move on to S&P-JPY jump probabilities, we observe that the correlations
peak during the October ’89 mini crash; after the Soviet Unrest in 91; around February 94,
when fears of a trade war between the US and Japan escalated due to economic tensions;
in February 2004, when Japan intervened heavily in the market, while inﬂation fears sent
stocks lower; and ﬁnally, during August 2007, when home issues started arising in the US,

140
which intensiﬁed the inverse relation between risky assets such as the AUD and stocks versus
safe havens like the Yen, causing jump probabilities for both S&P and JPY to escalate.
3.9.4
When Does Carry Jump?
In the previous section, we investigated the correlations between Carry and other portfolio’s
jump probabilities. Elevations in jump probabilities show us what kind of events cause a hike
in expectations of jumps. However, high correlations in jump probabilities do not necessarily
imply large jump sizes at those periods. In this section, we want to understand what kind
of events cause large positive or negative jumps in Carry returns. So in other words, rather
than the events that cause jumps, we are focusing on the jumps that impact returns the
most, and what type of events result in these jumps. Below is a list of time periods that
have large jumps and the corresponding events on these dates:

Figure 3.15: Estimated Carry Return Jump Sizes.
• June 2, 1987: After a period with low rates and weak dollar, Euro, which is shorted in
the Carry Portfolio, gains value.

141
• January 15, 1988 (positive jump): Trade deﬁcit comes out very positive; dollar peaks.
• October 12, 1988: OPEC curbs hopes; oil price peaks, dollar slumps.
• January 2, 1990(positive jump): Japan stocks hit record highs; Yen (shorted in Carry)
dips.
• January 17, 1991: News from Gulf War, conﬁdence in the US increases; stocks jump,
dollar, AUD fall.
• August 19, 1991: Soviet Unrest; Pound, Norwegian, Swedish Krona (which were longed
in Carry portfolio) plunge.
• July 09, 1992: Treasury Secretary speaks in Munich; dollar hikes after having plunged
to its lows with rate cuts.
• July 24, 1992 (positive jump): Low rate environment; dollar keeps falling, European
currencies gain.
• September 11, 1992: ERM crisis; European currencies (Pound, Swedish and Norwegian
Krona), which are longed in the Carry Portfolio, plunge.
• August 11, 1994: North Korean president Kim Sung dies; Yen hikes, which was already
strong against the dollar (inﬂation fears in the US).
• December 28, 1994: Peso Correction; dollar and other currencies volatile.
• May 11, 1995 (positive jump): Coordinated central bank intervention after dollar sinks
to record lows.
• November 1995: Government shutdown fear and budget talks aﬀect the dollar.
• December 3, 1996:
Japan cut rates; Yen initially falls, then jumps back.
Chief
economist of German Bundesbank says that the eﬀect of a single currency in Europe

142
could be a shift out of the German Mark to the dollar denominated assets as ner-
vous traders look for a safe haven; resulting in a surge in the dollar against European
currencies.
• May 9, 1997: Greenspan hints that the FED might not raise rates; dollar drops.
• March 1, 2000: Oil, gasoline prices peak on OECD talks.
• April 14, 2004: Rate hike expected; dollar gains; after multiple interventions Yen drops.
• February 27, 2007: Chinese correction, China and Europe release less than expected
growth reports; Pound, AUD decline while Swiss Franc, Yen gain.
• 2008 crisis: AUD, NZD, risky currencies longed in the Carry portfolio, plunge, whereas
Yen, Swiss Franc, which are shorted in Carry, gain as they are safe-haven currencies.
• February 04, 2010: European debt crisis; AUD, NZ drop, Yen gains value.
As these suggest, it is mostly country speciﬁc events rather than big ﬁnancial events that
cause big jumps in Carry returns.
3.9.5
Day to Day Event Analysis
As mentioned earlier, volatility correlations may reveal relationships that are not readily
observable from return correlations. For instance, return correlations may exhibit a negative
relationship at a given time period for two portfolios. This might suggest that there is a
factor only aﬀecting one of the portfolios and not the other. However, their volatilities may,
on the other hand, be very positively correlated, which would show that they are actually
both highly aﬀected by the same factor, but this eﬀect results in a positive return for one
portfolio, whereas it results in a negative return for the other. The opposite relationships
might exist as well. So in order to fully understand the relationship between two portfolios,
how diﬀerent factors and events aﬀect their volatilities and returns (diﬀerently or similarly),

143
and how these interactions change over time, we look at rolling correlations of both their
returns and volatilities.
Here, we will examine the relationship between the Carry Trade portfolio and the S&P
500. As can be seen from Figure 3.16, there are periods when their returns are positively
correlated, and their volatilities are negatively correlated; conversely, there are times when
their returns are negatively correlated, but their volatilities are positively correlated. There
are also times when both are correlated positively or negatively. Now we catalog historically
what type of events cause these relationships.

Carry−S&P Return Correlation
Figure 3.16: Carry-S&P Return and Volatility Correlations.
Periods of positive volatility, negative return correlation:
• July ’90: The FED cut rates; stocks gain, dollar and Carry weakens. Both volatilities
are elevated.
• January-April ’91: Gulf War; there is trust in the US, and stocks start to gain. AUD
and Pound fall due to volatile environment; negative returns for Carry (since both were
longed in the Carry portfolio). Both volatilities increase.

144
• August-December ’91: Soviet Unrest; stocks decline, European currencies such as
Pound, Norwegian and Swedish Krona start gaining value (they had dipped to lows
right during August 19, 1991 after Gorbachev was put under house arrest). These
are longed in the Carry portfolio, hence, Carry face positive returns. Both currency
(naturally Carry Trade) and stock volatilities hike.
Periods of both negative volatility and return correlations:
• July ’92: The FED cuts rates; stocks gain, dollar and Carry fall. Later German central
bank raises rates; currency volatility elevate, however, stock vols are stable.
• September ’92: ERM crisis; Pound, Swedish and Norwegian krona (which are longed
in Carry) plunge, hence, Carry returns sink. Stock returns are more stable, and their
volatility is less aﬀected than currencies.
Periods of negative volatility and positive return:
• September ’95: Bad trade news; dollar plunges, and Carry returns drop, vols increase.
Stocks face negative returns as well, but their volatilities are more stable.
• September ’96: The FED holds rates, inﬂation low; dollar, Carry Trade and stocks
gain value. Although stock volatility increases slightly, Carry vols are relatively stable.
• November ’96: Clinton wins elections; surge in stock returns and volatilities, the dollar
gains. Later, the FED holds rates; the dollar is mixed and stocks keep surging. Overall
Carry returns are positive, Carry vols are very stable, whereas stock vols elevate during
elections.
• December ’96: Japan cuts rates; Yen ﬁrst drops then gains back rapidly, causing
negative returns in Carry and a sudden peak in Carry vol. Stocks are going through
a bear market at this time period, especially due to year end. Stock vols escalate

145
throughout the month. Since Carry vols drop back to normal levels after the sudden
elevation, Carry and stock vols are negatively correlated at this time.
• May 2004: Rate hike expectations; stock returns drop, increasing its vol. The dollar
gains, AUD declines, causing Carry returns to fall as well, but Carry vols are more
stable.
Periods of positive return and volatility correlation:
• April ’98: BOJ intervention to support Yen (shorted in the Carry portfolio) and Asian
crisis; stocks and Carry dip. Both vols increase.
• August ’98: Russian crisis; stocks drop, Yen Carry Trades unwind, leading Yen (shorted
in Carry) to appreciate while AUD (longed in Carry) depreciates. Carry gets hit (also
as Euro, which was shorted in the Carry portfolio, starts gaining value). Both Carry
and stock vols elevate.
• September ’98: LTCM crisis; stocks plunge, Yen and Euro gain value (both shorted in
Carry), hence, Carry declines. Both stock and Carry vols elevate.
• May ’99: Inﬂation worries; stocks, dollar and Carry fall.
• February 2000: The Fed hikes rate, tech bubble starts to burst; stocks plunge. ECB
hikes rates as well; Euro (shorted in Carry) starts gaining, causing declines in Carry.
• November 2000: Mideast tensions; oil peaks, dollar, Carry and stocks fall. Vols elevate.
• March 2003: Iraq War; stocks and the dollar become volatile, hence, Carry vols in-
crease, returns are mixed. Stock returns, on the other hand, are positive since there is
conﬁdence in the US. Hence, although their vols are correlated, their return correlations
are lower.

146
• June 2005: The FED hikes rates; the dollar gains, stocks and Carry face negative
returns.
• February 2007: Chinese Correction; stocks plummet, AUD, NZD, Pound (which are
longed in Carry) dip while Swiss Franc, Yen (which are shorted in Carry) gain, causing
a big loss in Carry. Both vols elevate.
• 2008 crisis: AUD, NZD are longed and Swiss Franc, Yen are shorted in the Carry
portfolio. Since AUD, NZD are risky currencies they plunge, and Swiss Franc, Yen
gain as these are safe-haven currencies. Hence, the Carry Trade faces dramatic losses.
Similarly stock markets plummet, with both vols at their peaks.
• 2010: European debt crisis; AUD and NZD depreciate while Swiss Franc and Yen gain
value (the longed and shorted currencies are same as the 2008 period), resulting in
negative returns for Carry. Stocks dip during this time while both stock and Carry
volatilities increase.
3.10
Factor Analysis
In this section, we carry out a Factor Analysis for the 11 portfolios under consideration
(Carry, S&P 500, MOM, HML, Gold, DXY, AUD, Euro, JPY, Long Carry, Delta Short
Carry). Our aim is to understand whether there are common factors deriving some or all of
these portfolio returns and volatilities and how these factors change pre and post crisis. We
have shown in the previous section that there are portfolio pairs with very high return or
volatility correlations. This observation suggests that there might be some underlying factors
that impact a group of portfolios and motivates us for the Factor and Principal Component
Analysis.
Factor Analysis ﬁnds the smaller number of common factors that the measured vari-
ables depend on. Each factor can aﬀect several of the variables, and all variables are assumed

147
to be linear combinations of the factors. The corresponding coeﬃcients show the dominat-
ing factor for each variable. Factor Analysis also gives speciﬁc variances of each variable
as output. These variances show the independent random variability of each variable that
cannot be explained by the factors. We apply the Factor Analysis for both returns and
estimated volatilities. These analysis are conducted within the range of the minimum and
maximum possible number of factors, which is two and six for 11 portfolios. Next, we look at
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to infer about the most prominent factors. Although
Factor Analysis and PCA are both dimension reduction methods, the goal of PCA is to ﬁnd
the most prominent components that help reduce the overall unexplained variance, whereas
Factor Analysis aims at revealing the correlations among variables. Therefore, we use both
procedures to fully understand the nature of our portfolios. We also compare these results
with the sub-sample Factor Analysis to check for persistency.
We ﬁnd that it is indeed the case that there are common factors, and we can summa-
rize these portfolio returns under six main factors and volatilities under four main factors.
The PCA suggests that there are four main components that reduce the total variance of
returns, and two main components for volatilities. It also reveals an interesting feature: for
both returns and volatilities, the ﬁrst principal component is the eﬀect on S&P and impacts
Carry, Long Carry and AUD as well. It explains 30% of the variance for returns and 75% for
volatilities. Moreover, for volatility, the ﬁrst component also impacts MOM, HML as well as
S&P, Carry, Long Carry and AUD. This suggests that there is a common factor that derives
the volatilities of all risky assets and explains 75% of their variance.
The sub-sample Factor Analysis is pretty stable before and after crisis. However, for
both return and volatility, S&P and AUD switch to the Carry, Long Carry factor only after
the crisis.
These results motivate us for the next chapter where we apply a Multivariate Markov
Switching Model to the portfolios and perform a trading strategy, by which we invest in the

148
optimal factors determined by the Markowitz model at each time period. The results of the
portfolio optimization support our ﬁndings from Factor Analysis. The portfolios invested at
each period switch between portfolios that are in risky factors and portfolios that are in less
risky factors (depending on the estimated state by the Markov Switching Model).
3.10.1
Factor Analysis for Returns
We ﬁnd that six factors explain the return data best since the remaining variances of most
variables drop close to 50% with only this many factors. The factor loadings are shown in
Table 3.11.

represented by the following portfolio groupings:
• Carry, Long Carry, AUD
• DXY, Gold
• HML, MOM

• JPY

Delta Carry has a negligible coeﬃcient with all factors and still has 99% unexplained variance.

Principal Component Analysis (Table 3.12) supports the Factor Analysis results and
clariﬁes which components are more prominent in explaining the total variance. The ﬁrst
component mostly aﬀects S&P, which corresponds to the negative eﬀect on S&P returns.
With a smaller negative coeﬃcient, this component impacts Carry, Long Carry and AUD
as well and explains about 30% of the total variance. The second component is the positive
eﬀect on Gold returns; this aﬀects DXY returns negatively and AUD returns positively. 17%
of the total variance is explained by this component. The third component corresponds to
the positive eﬀect on S&P returns and negative eﬀect on JPY returns, explaining 13% of
total variance. This component also impacts Carry, Long Carry and AUD negatively. The
fourth component corresponds to the eﬀect on MOM returns, explaining 12% of the variance.
These four components explain more than 70% of the total variance.

Next, in Table 3.13 we examine the two sub-samples chosen to test persistency, which
are before and after the 2008 crisis. The Factor Analysis for these sub-samples are mostly
consistent with the general results. One diﬀerences is, both S&P and AUD switch to being
in the same factor as Carry, Long Carry after the crisis (S&P from being in the same factor
as HML, and AUD from being in the same factor as DXY before crisis). Another diﬀerence
is, MOM appears in the same factor with HML, and Euro appears in the same factor as
DXY after crisis, whereas they were separate factors pre crisis. And ﬁnally, JPY switches
from the DXY factor to the Carry factor in the second subperiod.2
3.10.2
Factor Analysis for Volatilities
We ﬁnd that four factors are adequate to explain the volatilities. The unexplained variances
for all portfolios drop to about 50% with four factors, and adding the ﬁfth factor does not
reduce the variances any further. The factor loadings are shown in Table 3.14.
2since JPY is expressed in terms of its dollar value (USDJPY), positive returns for JPY means, Yen is
losing value against the dollar. Since the Yen is a low-interest-rate currency and is usually shorted in the
Carry portfolio, this leads to a gain in Carry returns. Hence, positive return for JPY corresponds to positive
return in Carry

As the the loading in Table 3.14 suggest, the factors for volatilities can be represented
by the following portfolio groupings:
• Carry, S&P, Long Carry, Delta Carry, AUD, JPY
• MOM, HML
• DXY, Euro
• Gold, (AUD)
These factors are intuitive. As can be seen, the portfolios from the currency market, the stock
market, and commodity market roughly form separate factors. The ﬁrst factor corresponds
to the assets that are conceived to be most risky. 3 AUD has a slightly higher coeﬃcient for
the ﬁrst factor; however, it is also aﬀected by the Gold factor.
3JPY is an exception, however, JPY is a crucial part of the Carry portfolio. Having a very low interest
rate, it is almost always shorted in the Carry portfolio. Hence, Carry portfolio and JPY volatilities are
impacted by the same factor

The Principal Component Analysis (Table 3.15) highlights an interesting feature: the
ﬁrst principal component represents the common factor deriving the risky asset volatilities.
It has the highest coeﬃcient on S&P then MOM and impacts Carry, Long Carry, HML,
Gold and AUD as well. This component explains 75% of the total variance. This shows us
that there is a single common factor that is deriving 75% of the risky asset risks. The second
component represents the factor eﬀecting MOM and HML vols.
These two components
together explain about 90% of the total variance. The fourth component is the eﬀect on
Carry, AUD, Long Carry, JPY; however, this component solely explains 2.6% of the total
variance.

The sub-sample factor analysis for the volatilities are very similar to the general factor

153
analysis. The only two diﬀerences are: S&P switches from being in the same factor as MOM,
HML and AUD switches from being in the same factor as Gold in the pre crisis period to
being in the same factor as Carry, Delta Carry, Long Carry and JPY after the crisis.

Summary
In this chapter, we have selected the best-ﬁtted model for each portfolio using the model
diagnostic method introduced in chapter two. Then using the selected model estimation
results, we have used various measures to compare the risks of the 11 portfolios under con-
sideration. These measures are variance decompositions of returns and volatilities, average
volatility percentiles, impact of volatilities on returns, and skewness and kurtosis analysis.
Variance decompositions decompose the total variance of returns and volatilities into their
jump and diﬀusion components. This tells us how much of the total risk in returns and vols
are due to jumps. Average volatility percentiles show the extreme values each portfolio’s
volatilities take. This gives us an understanding of their average vol distributions. Direct
impact of volatilities on returns is assessed by the regressor coeﬃcient of volatility in the
return equation. The signs of the 5th and 95th percentile values suggest whether the impact
of vols are signiﬁcantly positive, negative or not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than zero. Finally,
the skewness and kurtosis analysis show whether extreme negative or positive returns are
more likely to be observed and whether the variance of returns are mostly due to extreme
observations.
We have found that the volatility extremes, the negative impact of volatility on re-
turns, percent of variance due to jumps for returns and volatilities, and negative skewness
are more pronounced for Carry Trades than for other market portfolios. This shows that
Carry has a more complicated risk structure than other portfolios.
In addition to that, we have presented the rolling correlations of these portfolio’s
returns, vols and jumps to show how they co-move and how these relationships change over

154
time.
Finally, we have carried out a Factor Analysis on the 11 portfolio’s returns and volatil-
ities. We have found that their returns can be grouped under six main factors, and their
vols can be represented by four main factors. Moreover, the Principal Component Analysis
suggests that there is a common factor deriving all risky portfolios’ volatilities, and this
factor explains 75% of the total variance.
These observations motivate the next chapter. We have so far observed from the
stochastic volatilities that these portfolio vols are time-varying, the rolling correlations have
demonstrated how their correlations change over time, and the Factor Analysis has shown
that there are common factors deriving their vols and returns. Therefore, in the next chapter,
we estimate a multivariate Markov switching model using these 11 portfolios.
We then
develop a new trading strategy, in which we invest in the optimal portfolios found by the
Markowitz model using the estimation results of the MS model at each time period.

Introduction
Throughout the paper, we have demonstrated the very strong relationship among 11 port-
folios from commodities, stock and currency markets. We pointed out the high correlations
between their returns, volatilities, and jumps, and we have shown how these correlations
change over time. Factor Analysis has also conﬁrmed this strong correlation and grouped
the portfolio returns and volatilities under a few common factors. Also, through the SV
model estimations, we exhibited the dynamic nature of these portfolio returns and volatil-
ities. So, the natural question that arises is how one can construct a trading strategy that
would incorporate this dynamic relationship among these portfolios.
Changes in the portfolio correlations, dynamic volatilities, and returns suggest that
the covariance matrix and mean vector of these portfolios might be shifting between diﬀerent
states. This motivates us to apply a multivariate normal Markov switching (MS) model to
the 11 portfolios.
The model estimation results indicate that there are indeed switches
155

156
in covariances and means of these portfolios, and we ﬁnd, through our diagnostic method
introduced in Chapter 2, that two states are adequate in representing the data.
Once we obtain MS model estimations at each time period, we use these as input to
the Markowitz model to ﬁnd the optimal portfolio weights to invest in. We ﬁnd through
the out-of-sample test that this trading strategy yields a higher sharp ratio than all the
individual input and benchmark portfolios. It should be noted that from now on, we will
call the input portfolios factors to avoid confusion with the optimal portfolio constructed by
investing in the input portfolios with appropriate weights.
The organization of this chapter is as follows. We ﬁrst deﬁne the multivariate MS
model and describe how the model estimation results are used in portfolio optimization.
We later present the full sample estimation results of the two-state and three-state MS
models and select the two-state model as the better-ﬁtted model using the diagnostic method
introduced in Chapter 2. Finally, we show the out-of-sample performance of our trading
strategy, in which we reestimate the MS model and use the results to select the optimal
factors to invest in at each time period.
4.2
Multivariate Normal MS model
Markov Switching models are designed to capture the structural breaks and shifts in the
model parameters through time.
They are made of two or more states, and the model
switches between these states, taking the parameters (mean vectors, covariance matrix and
transition probabilities) of that state at each time period. This elicits their nonlinear and
dynamic nature.
MS models have been widely used in the multivariate setting (Ang & Bekaert, 2004;
Cakmakli, Paap, & Dijk, 2010; Harris, 2000; Lopes & Carvalho, 2007; Chen, 2007). In this
chapter we use the simplest multivariate MS model, which can be represented as:

157
Rt = µSt + Σ1/2
St ε
where, Rt is the return data matrix, Rt and µSt are d dimensional, ΣSt is dxd dimensional,
and Stǫ{1, 0} for two state model and Stǫ{0, 1, 2} for the three state model. p and q are
sequentially the transition probabilities of going from state 0 to state 0 and state 1 to
state 1. In the three state model, we have six transition probabilities, corresponding to
p00, p01, p10, p11, p20, p21.
In our application we take weekly returns from 1987 to 2010 in order to avoid frequent
regime switches and to have more persistency in states. We start by using all 11 factors, so
we have 11 dimensions.
4.3
Portfolio Optimization
Once we obtain the parameter and latent variable estimations from the MS model (St, µSt, ΣSt, p, q),
our trading strategy is to solve for the optimal portfolio weights, using the Markowitz model.
We solve for the minimum variance portfolio as described:
min xTΣx −λxTµ
s.t. xT1 = 1
We ﬁrst start by using the two-state model estimation results obtained from the full data
series to solve for the optimal weights from 1987 to 2010. The parameter estimations are

158
used as such:
Et(r(t + 1)|st = 0) = qµ0 + (1 −q)µ1
Et(r(t + 1)|st = 1) = pµ1 + (1 −p)µ0
Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 0) = qΣ0 + (1 −q)Σ1
Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 1) = pΣ1 + (1 −p)Σ0
At each time period:
Et(r(t + 1)) = P(st = 1) ∗Et(r(t + 1)|st = 1) + P(st = 0) ∗Et(r(t + 1)|st = 0)
Et(Σ(t + 1)) = P(st = 1) ∗Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 1) + P(st = 0) ∗Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 0)
We plug the expected return and expected covariance into the Markowitz model, where
Σ = Et(Σ(t + 1)) , µ = Et(r(t + 1)), and we solve for the optimal portfolio at each time
period. The optimal portfolio weights indicate that the weights switch between investing in
Carry, S&P, MOM and HML to HML, DXY, and Delta Carry. Hence, AUD, JPY, Euro and
Long Carry are not assigned any weight.
This is only a preliminary analysis to deduce the preferred factors. These weights
cannot be actually used to infer about the portfolio performance since we are using the
whole data set as input to ﬁnd the historical weights. So in order to get the out-of-sample
performance, we reestimate the model at every time period utilizing only data available up
to that date and use these estimation results for portfolio optimization to ﬁnd the weights
at that period.
For an extensive study, we carry out this procedure with both two-and three-state
models. For computational ease, we reestimate the model parameters every year (however,
we estimate the states every week) and reduce the dimensionality by focusing on the seven
factors that had positive weights in our preliminary analysis. Hence, to reduce the number

159
of parameters estimated, we drop AUD, JPY, Euro and Long Carry, none of which were
invested in.
To summarize, for both two and three state models, we estimate the Multivariate
Normal MS model parameters every year from 1993 to 2010. Using those parameters (the
latest estimation results), at each week we estimate the state, and we solve for the minimum
variance portfolio weights. For the two-state model, the expected return and covariance that
is used in portfolio optimization at each time period is calculated by:
Et(r(t + 1)) = P(st = 1) ∗Et(r(t + 1)|st = 1) + P(st = 0) ∗Et(r(t + 1)|st = 0)
Et(Σ(t + 1)) = P(st = 1) ∗Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 1) + P(st = 0) ∗Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 0)
where:
Et(r(t + 1)|st = 0) = qtµ0
t + (1 −qt)µ1
t
Et(r(t + 1)|st = 1) = ptµ1
t + (1 −pt)µ0
t
Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 0) = qtΣ0
t + (1 −qt)Σ1
t
Et(Σ(t + 1)|st = 1) = ptΣ1
t + (1 −pt)Σ0
t
The calculations for the three-state model are a similar extension of the above formulas.
The portfolio return from holding weights wt calculated above will be: P
i wi
t ∗Ri
t+1.
Using these weights, we can backtest the out-of-sample performance of the trading strategy
by using the historical returns of each of the factors.
Although the three-state model allows for additional ﬂexibility in means and covari-
ances, it also adds a substantial number of extra parameters that needs to be estimated.
Therefore, to decide whether it provides a better ﬁt to the data compared to the two-state
model, we apply the residual diagnostics introduced in Chapter 2 to both models. Before we
go into the details of this model selection, we present the estimation results of the two-and

160
three-state models for the full data sample.
4.4
Full Sample Estimation Results for the Two-State
Model
In this section we present the two-state model estimations for the whole data sample from
1987 to 2010. Before going into the model selection or portfolio optimization, we want to
check whether the full sample MS model outputs provide intuitive mean, covariance and
state estimations.
We ﬁrst show the mean vector estimations in both states:

As can be seen from Table 4.1, the two states represent the positive versus negative
return periods. However, a few observations worth noting are in order. First, HML, Gold,
and Delta Carry have positive returns in both states, but the returns in one of the states
are very close to zero. DXY, on the other hand, has negative, close to zero returns in both
states. Second, the state representing the positive returns for the other factors (Carry, S&P,
MOM) is the state in which HML, Gold and Delta Carry have their returns close to zero
(negative for DXY), and the state representing the negative returns for other factors is the
state for which these have positive returns. These features can also be observed in Figure
4.1, which shows the changes in the mean posteriors for both states. This decomposition
among two groups of factor returns is an important feature for diversifying purposes.

We observe that the ﬁrst state is the high correlation state, and the second state is
the low correlation state (in absolute terms). The two exceptions are for DXY and Gold, for
which the correlations with most factors are higher in the second state. Three interesting
features to highlight are listed. First, Carry and S&P are positively correlated in both states.
Second, Gold and DXY are negatively correlated in both states, which is consistent with their
known long-term inverse relationship (excluding periods of crisis, as the dollar weakens, gold
becomes more valuable). Third, Delta Carry does not have any substantial correlation with
any of the factors in both states. This is a very useful property to reduce the exposure to
the common factors aﬀecting other portfolios. These results can be seen from Figure 4.2,

162
which plots the changes in the correlations in both states.

Again, the ﬁrst state corresponds to the high variance and the second one corresponds
to the low variance periods. These variance switches support our intuition to use stochastic
volatility models to infer about the riskiness of these portfolios.

Figure 4.3: State Estimations for the Two-State Model.
The state estimations are consistent with big market events, considering the param-
eter posteriors. We can see from Figure 4.3 that the states are estimated as the ﬁrst state,
which represents the high volatility, high correlation, and negative return state, at time pe-
riods corresponding to the ’87 crisis, the Iraq War in 1990, the Soviet Unrest in 1991, the
ERM crisis in 1992, the Asia crisis in 1997, the LTCM and Russian crisis in 1998, dot-com
bubble in 2000, 9/11, the Iraq war in 2003, and ﬁnally the 2007-2008 crisis.
The steady state probabilities are estimated as 0.27 and 0.73 sequentially, with the

Full Sample Estimation Results for the Three-State
Model
We now present the three-state MS model estimations for the full data sample from 1987
to 2010. Our goal is to understand how three-state model results diﬀer from the two-state
model estimations and whether it provides additional information that is not captured by
the two-state model.

The three-state model mean estimations are very similar to the two-state model es-
timations.
As we can see both from the Table 4.5 and Figure 4.4, the additional state
represents the highest positive return for S&P and MOM, a medium return (of what is es-
timated by two-state model) for Carry and DXY, and the lowest negative return for HML,
Gold, and Delta Carry. So, the additional state is extending the highest or lowest return
state and creating a medium return state for all factors.

The ﬁrst states in the three-and two-state models have almost identical correlations.
The additional state in the three-state model extends the highest correlations for some

166
factors; hence, the highest correlations are observed either in the ﬁrst or second state. The
third state represents the low correlation periods. When we examine Tables 4.6-4.7 and
Figure 4.5, we observe that the properties stated in the two-state model holds here as well:
Carry-S&P have positive correlations, Gold-DXY and HML-S&P have negative correlations
in all three states, and Delta Carry is not signiﬁcantly correlated with the other factors.
However, there is a slight diﬀerence in Carry correlations with Gold and DXY. In the high
correlation states Carry-DXY have a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.77, which is much higher
than 0.23, as was estimated by the two-state model. Carry-Gold, on the other hand, have a
correlation of -0.33, which was estimated to be insigniﬁcant by the two-state model.

As we can see from Figure 4.6, the state estimations are almost identical to the two-
state model estimations. The ﬁrst state again represents the high variance, high correlation
and negative return states. And periods, which are estimated to be in the ﬁrst state cor-
respond to the exact same times: the ’87 crisis, the Iraq War in 1990, the Soviet Unrest in

168
1991, the ERM crisis in 1992, the Asia crisis in 1997, the LTCM and Russian crisis in 1998,
dot-com bubble in 2000, 9/11, the Iraq War in 2003, and ﬁnally the 2007-2008 crisis. The
most obvious diﬀerence occurs between years 1995-1997, when the state estimation by the
three-state model is the second state, representing the high correlation, lower variance and
positive return (for Carry, S&P, MOM) state, whereas in the two-state model there are rare
switches to the ﬁrst state.
The steady state probabilities for each state sequentially are 0.25, 0.1 and 0.65, with

Model Selection
As mentioned before, the three-state model provides ﬂexibility in representing the means,
covariances and states of the portfolios. However, it adds a substantial amount of extra
parameters that need to be estimated. Therefore, we want to test whether it yields a better
ﬁt than the two-state model for our portfolio returns. To select between the two-and three-
state models, we use the residual analysis that was presented in Chapter 2. The residuals of
the multivariate normal MS model are:
εt = Σ−1/2
St
∗(Rt −µSt)
Then for both two-and three-state models, using the full sample estimations, we record

169
the residuals of each time period at each iteration and for each dimension (corresponding
to the seven input portfolios (factors)). Hence, we obtain G*T*dim (which in our case is
1160*4000*7) residuals. If the model is correct, at each simulation and time period, the
seven residuals (across all dimensions) should be independent standard normals. So using
the results of the previous chapter, we take the order statistics of the residuals across time for
each dimension and every simulation. Then we calculate the averages of these order statistics
across all simulations. This generates T*dim= 1160*7 averaged order statistics. Now, for
each factor, the 1160 averaged order statistic should have the same distribution as standard
normal. Then we apply the analysis suggested earlier. So, for each factor, we compare the
QQ plots, skewness, kurtosis and tail analysis of two-state and three-state models. The QQ
plots of the factors that are slightly distinguishable for the two models are as follows.

As can be seen from the above ﬁgures, although the three-state model has slightly
better tails for the third factor, for both fourth and sixth factors, the two-state model yields
an obviously better ﬁt.

We can see from the total skewness and kurtosis that the two-state model leads to a
much higher magnitude improvement in kurtosis than the third-state model does in skewness
(31.84-32.71=0.87 vs. 0.5-0.33=0.17). But, to have a more certain view we also compare
their tail distributions. The results (Table 4.11) indicate that the number of observations
above (below) plus (minus) one, two and three standard deviations are all slightly closer to
the standard normal distribution values for the two-state model. As a result, although the
two-state and three-state models are very similar in their proximity to standard normal, the
two state model leads to a slightly better ﬁt. Hence, for the portfolio optimization we use
the estimation results from the two-state model.

Portfolio Optimization Results
Using the two-state model estimations, we apply the portfolio optimization strategy de-
scribed in Section 4.3. Each year from 1993 to 2010, we reestimate the model parameters
and use these latest parameter estimations to estimate latent variables (states) each week
throughout that year. We use these parameters and states to ﬁnd the optimal weights by
the Markowitz model as described earlier (Section 4.3). How the estimated means and cor-
relations change from 1993 to 2010 are shown in Tables 4.12-4.13.

Although the parameter estimations are mainly consistent throughout the time, a few
observations are worth noting. In mean estimations, MOM exhibits positive returns in both
states after ’97, like HML. Similarly, Gold shows this characteristic after 2002. Moreover,
Gold means are estimated to be substantially negative until ’93 in the ﬁrst state. This is
coherent with the gold prices shown earlier (in Figure 3.10); Gold faces its big losses during
the ’88-’89 and ’91-’92 periods. Estimated means in state one for DXY are also more negative
until ’97. We have pointed out to huge dollar losses during ’89-’90 and a free fall of the dollar
in ’95 in the Correlation Analysis (Section 3.9, Chapter 3). This explains the very negative
mean estimates of DXY until ’97.

174
Similar to means, correlation estimations also show a few changes through time. First,
Carry and S&P correlations are negative in the ﬁrst state in ’93 and only become positively
correlated in both states after ’97. S&P-MOM correlations are highly positively correlated in
both states until 2007; after that, they exhibit a negative coeﬃcient in the high correlation
state. And ﬁnally, S&P-Gold correlation coeﬃcients show a continuous decrease through
time.
Solving for the minimum variance portfolio yields very intuitive weights at each time
period.
In the ’90s, depending on the estimated state, the optimal weights switch between
Carry, MOM, HML, Delta Carry (where HML, Delta Carry have very small weights) and
HML, Delta Carry (with very large weights). Then after ’98, the weights switch between
Carry, S&P, MOM, HML and MOM, HML, Delta Carry. And in the ﬁnal years, after 2007,
the weights are assigned to either Carry, S&P, MOM, HML or MOM, HML, Gold, Delta
Carry (or HML, DXY, Delta Carry).
These are very intuitive since when the estimated state is the second state, corre-
sponding to low correlation and high positive returns for Carry, S&P, and MOM and low
positive returns for HML, Gold, and Delta Carry, weights are distributed mostly among
Carry, S&P and MOM. As it was pointed out, since Delta Carry is not eﬀected by the com-
mon factors impacting other market portfolios, it is reasonable that it has a small positive
weight in this second state as well. When the estimated state is the ﬁrst state, correspond-
ing to high correlations and negative returns for Carry, S&P, and MOM and higher positive
returns for HML, Gold, and Delta Carry, the weights are assigned mainly to HML and Delta
Carry.
The changes in the portfolio weights when the estimated state is the ﬁrst state are
due to a number of facts.
As was pointed out in the mean estimation changes through
time, MOM has positive returns in both states after ’97, which also explains its negative

175
correlation to S&P after this period. Hence, MOM appears with a positive weight at periods
in the ﬁrst state after ’98. Similarly, Gold has positive returns in both states only after 2007.
So it is only assigned weights in these later time periods. And ﬁnally, as a safe haven, DXY,
which has the lowest variance (after Delta Carry) in the ﬁrst state, appears in the ﬁrst state
portfolios in the later time periods since it has a less negative expected return in this state
only after then. The only change in the second state portfolios is for S&P; it appears in
these portfolios only after ’98. This can be attributed to the higher positive returns of S&P
after ’97.
These results are very coherent with the Factor Analysis results shown in the previous
chapter. Factor Analysis had suggested that Carry, Long Carry, and S&P volatilities were
all in the same factor, and their returns were in the same factor after the crisis. Separately,
MOM-HML and Gold-DXY were aﬀected by the same factors as well. Delta Carry was not
found to be signiﬁcantly impacted by any of the factors. Hence, we see that the optimal
portfolios suggest investing in the Carry, S&P factor in low variance (low correlation) states
and in HML, (MOM in late periods), DXY (or Gold), and Delta Carry in the high variance
(high correlation) states.

Portfolio Performance
We can calculate the out-of-sample portfolio performance once we ﬁnd the optimal portfolio
weights every week. Assuming we hold wi
t of each factor i, at week t, the observed return
from holding this portfolio at t+1 will be P
i wi
t ∗ri
t+1. Since we know the historical returns
for each factor, we can easily ﬁnd the portfolio return at each time period.
By applying this procedure, we get the out-of-sample portfolio returns from 1993 to
2010. The Sharp ratio is found to be 1.25 for this strategy. When we do a sub-sample
analysis of the portfolio performance, we observe that the only periods that reduces the
Sharp ratio are between years ’97-’98 and 2007-2008. However, even in these periods the

176
expected returns are found to be positive. In all other periods our strategy performs very
well. The two year interval portfolio sharp ratios, annualized means, standard deviations
and skewness are shown in Table 4.14.

The Sharp ratio of our trading strategy (1.25) is found to be higher than all the input
portfolios (factors). The Sharp ratios of the input portfolios are shown in Table 4.15:

We also compared the performance of our trading strategy to two benchmark port-
folios. First is an equal weighted portfolio, second is a vol adjusted portfolio, where we
assigned the normalized expected return divided by expected variance (calculated from MS
estimation results) as the weight for each factor at each time period. These portfolios yielded
Sharp ratios of 1.16 and 0.95, which are lower than our portfolio’s sharp ratio.

Summary
In this chapter, we have estimated a multivariate Markov switching model using the port-
folios under consideration. The estimation results of the MS model suggest that there are
indeed switches between these portfolio means and covariances. This conﬁrms our earlier
ﬁndings through the stochastic volatilities and rolling correlations that these portfolio means,
correlations and variances change over time. We ﬁnd, using our model diagnostic method,
that two states are adequate to represent these switches.
We have then developed a trading strategy, in which we ﬁnd the optimal portfolios
to invest in by the Markowitz model using the estimation results of the MS model at each
time period. The optimal portfolios invested in support the Factor Analysis groupings. We
ﬁnd that this strategy yields a sharp ratio of 1.25 and performs much better than all input
and benchmark portfolios.
