Do your own metric scavenger hunt! Find a ruler that
is marked off in centimeters. If you don’t have a ruler
you can print a paper ruler from the Internet. Find ten
different objects. The first should have a length,
width, or thickness of one centimeter. The second 
should have a length, width, or thickness of
two centimeters, and so on until you find an
object that is ten centimeters long, wide, or
thick. List and describe your ten objects.

wheels, when they first established where they were going by 
looking at the stars. Today, when you get off the school bus, go 
home and turn on the lights, put a CD on the player, you are in a 
way as far from your 19th-century ancestors — from your own 
relatives who lived like everyone, without electricity and 
automobiles, without radio and telephones — as you are from 
those ancient groups from early human history. How did the 
things we consider basic — heat, light, navigation, 
transportation, entertainment — and the things your great 
great-grandparents before you considered basic, ever come to be?
The answers all touch on physics and chemistry. Physical 
science, the subject of this book, includes physics and chemistry. 
Physics tells us how and why things move. Chemistry tells us 
how to make things and what things are made of. Even the most 
brilliant scientists, the most imaginative inventors, are born not 
knowing any science at all. Science has been learned over many 
thousands of years. This chapter is also about how scientists use 
inquiry to learn how the world works.
1. What is physical science and why is it important to learn?
2. How did people figure out the scientific knowledge that
we know?

1.1 The Physical Science in Your Life
In Unit One we will look at the ‘big picture’ of physical science. We will also review how 
people learned science in the first place. Each Unit after the first will then focus on one 
important area of physical science in more detail.
The physics of a car
Cars changed the
way people live
Few inventions have changed the 
world as much as the car. Before 
cars, it was a three-week, 
dangerous adventure to travel 500 
miles between San Diego and San 
Francisco. Today, you might drive 
the same trip in a day to visit your 
relatives. Let’s take a look at the 
physics and chemistry in an 
ordinary car.
Forces are
described by
physics
When you push on the gas pedal at a stoplight the car starts moving. 
The car starts moving because the engine causes a force that pushes 
the car forward. If there were no force, the car would not start 
moving. Forces are described by physics. Physics tells us how much 
force it takes to get the car moving. Physics also tells us how much 
force it takes to make the car turn or stop.
Mass is also
described by
physics
If you apply the same amount of force to a small sports car and to a 
big garbage truck, which one will start moving faster? Of course you 
know the answer (Figure 1.1). The sports car starts moving faster 
because a sports car has less mass than a garbage truck. The more 
mass you have, the more force it takes to get you moving. The reverse 
is also true. If you apply the same force to two objects, the one with 
less mass will start moving faster. The relationship between mass 
and motion is described by physics.

CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
The chemistry of a car
Chemistry
describes the
different forms of
matter
Look at a car and describe what the car is made of. At the most basic 
level a scientist might say a car is made of matter. Matter is 
everything that has mass and takes up space. This book is matter. You 
are matter. Even the air is matter. At the next level of detail, a car 
contains many different kinds of matter, such as steel, aluminum, 
plastic, and rubber. Chemistry is the science that concerns the 
different kinds of matter, how different kinds of matter are created 
and how matter can be changed from one kind to another.
Matter appears as
solid, liquid, and
gas
The matter in a car comes in three fundamental phases: called solid 
liquid, and gas (Figure 1.2). Solid matter (like ice) is stiff, holds its 
shape, and may be strong. The frame of the car is made of solid steel. 
Liquid matter (like water) flows and does not hold its shape. Gasoline, 
oil, and windshield washer fluid are all liquids that are used in a car. 
Matter that is a gas (like air) can expand and contract. The air in the 
tires is a gas, as is the exhaust coming out the tailpipe.
Burning gasoline
is a chemical
reaction
Virtually all of today’s cars and trucks run on gasoline. You put 
gasoline in the tank and it is burned in the engine. The burning 
gasoline releases energy that makes the engine turn and makes the 
car work. Burning is a chemical change that turns gasoline and 
oxygen into carbon dioxide, water and other kinds of matter. 
Chemistry describes what gasoline is, and how gasoline combines with 
oxygen in a chemical reaction that releases energy.

UNIT 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Figure 1.3: The otter’s streamlined 
body reduces the force of water friction 
when it swims. The otters webbed feet 
increase the force of water friction 
against its feet, making the otter more 
effective at pushing against the water.
Figure 1.4: Chemistry describes how 
living organisms use the food they eat.
Physical science and sea otters
Physical science
and living things
A sea otter is a small furry mammal 
that spends all of its life in the water. 
Sea otters live in the giant kelp 
forests off the California coast. Like 
all living creatures, sea otters depend 
on physics and chemistry to exist.
The force of
water friction
In order to swim, a sea otter has a streamlined body and webbed feet. 
The streamlined body shape reduces the friction of water against the 
sea otter’s skin as it swims (Figure 1.3). The lower the force of water 
friction, the faster the sea otter can swim. The otter’s webbed feet 
work in the opposite way. Having webs between its toes increases the 
force of water friction against the sea otter’s outstretched feet. This 
makes the sea otter more effective in pushing against the water to 
swim. Friction and forces are described by physics.
Why a sea otter
floats instead of
sinking
To find the shellfish they eat, sea otters dive down to the sea floor at 
the bottom of the kelp forest. Once they get a tasty clam or scallop, 
the otter swims back up to the surface and floats there to eat it. When 
it is floating, the sea otter is not swimming, yet it does not sink! A sea 
otter floats because its body is less dense than water. Density is a 
property of all matter, not just sea otters. Objects that are less dense 
(like the sea otter) float in liquids that are more dense (like water). 
Why living
organisms need
food to survive
Like most living organisms, a sea otter eats to survive. What is 
eating? Why do living organisms need food? The answer is provided 
by chemistry (Figure 1.4). Living organisms are made of special 
chemicals known as proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The sea otter 
needs these chemicals to provide energy to keep its body warm. The 
otter also needs these chemicals to grow. The otter gets the chemicals 
it needs by eating shellfish. Biochemistry is a branch of chemistry 
that explores exactly how plants and animals use chemicals and 
energy.

1.1 THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN YOUR LIFE
CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
The sun is the source of energy for Earth
The sun and
energy
Both living creatures and human technology derive virtually all of 
their energy from the sun. Without the Sun’s energy, Earth would be a 
cold icy place with a temperature of -273 degrees Celsius. As well as 
warming the planet, the Sun’s energy drives the entire food chain 
(Figure 1.5). Plants store the energy in carbohydrates, like sugar. 
Animals eat the plants to get energy. Other animals eat those animals 
for their energy. It all starts with the sun.
Understanding
what energy
really is
If energy is so important, what is it? The answer is slippery but 
essential to physics and chemistry. Energy measures the ability for 
things to change. Energy is exchanged when anything changes. 
Nothing changes when no energy is exchanged. For example, when 
you press its accelerator, the speed of a car changes.  The change 
comes from the exchange of energy between the gasoline in the engine 
and the motion of the whole car. The sea otter’s body is warmer inside 
than the surrounding ocean water. Because the otter is warmer, heat 
energy flows from the otter into the ocean water. The otter needs a 
constant supply of energy from its food to replenish the energy 
exchanged with the water. Energy is such an important idea that you 
will find examples of energy in every single Unit of this book!
Life on Mars and
other planets
A very important question in science 
today is whether there is life on other 
planets, such as Mars. Mars is farther 
from the sun than Earth. For this 
reason, Mars receives less energy from 
the sun than does Earth. In fact, the 
average temperature on Mars is well 
below the freezing point of water. Can 
life exist on Mars? Recent research 
suggests that can. Scientists have found 
living bacteria in the Antarctic ice living 
at a temperature colder than the 
average temperature of Mars.
Figure 1.5: The flow of energy from 
the sun supports all living things on 
Earth.
The planet Venus is closer to the 
sun than Earth. Should this make 
Venus warmer or colder than 
Earth? Research your answer to 
see what scientists think Venus is 
like on the planet surface.

UNIT 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Using new words
Write two sentences about 
something you know using each 
new glossary word. Using a new 
word helps you to remember what 
it means and how it is used. In fact, 
if you do not use a new word right 
away you are very likely to forget it 
within a few hours!
Science assigns precise meanings 
to many common words
Many words in science are words 
you already know, like “force” or 
“energy”. However, science 
defines these words in very 
precise ways that may be different 
from how they are used in 
everyday conversation. When you 
see a common word used in 
science, do not assume it means 
the same thing as it would in 
casual conversation.
1.1 Section Review
Based on what you learned in this section, decide which of the 
following statements are true and which are false.
1. Understanding force and mass are part of the subject of physical 
science.
2. Physical science applies to mechanical inventions such as a car 
but not to living creatures.
3. Steel is matter because it is solid but water is not matter because 
water can flow and change its shape.
4. Matter can take the form of solid, liquid, or gas.
5. A sea otter floats because it eats a special kind of shellfish that it 
gets from the ocean floor.
6. The Earth receives a significant amount of its energy from the 
Moon and the other planets.
7. A car increases its speed primarily because energy is exchanged 
between the tires and the road. (careful, this is tricky to answer!)
8. Mars is warmer than Earth because it receives more energy from 
the sun than Earth does.
9. Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates are the three phases of matter 
in living creatures.
10. Gasoline is necessary for most cars because it is used in a 
chemical reaction inside the engine.

1.2 TIME AND LENGTH
CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
1.2 Time and Length
In science we often want to know what happens next based on what happened before.  
The concepts of next and before involve time. Time plays an essential role in science. We 
also need a way to describe the size of things from the tiniest bacteria to the entire solar 
system. In physical science, size is described by length. This section is about the way 
scientists measure and communicate information about time and length. 
Two meanings for time
What time is it?
Time has two important meetings (Figure 1.6). One meaning is to 
identify a particular moment in the past or in the future. For example, 
saying your 18th birthday party will be on January 1st, 2010 at 2:00 
p.m. identifies a particular moment in the future for your party to 
start. This is the way “time” is usually used in everyday conversation. 
You may think of this meaning as historical time. If you ask, “What 
time is it?” you usually want to identify a moment in historical time. 
To answer the question, you would look at a calendar, clock or your 
watch.
How much time?
The second meaning is to describe a quantity of time. For example, 
saying that a class lasts for 45 minutes is identifying a quantity of 
time; 45 minutes.  If you ask, “How much time?” (did something take 
to occur, for instance), you are looking for a quantity of time. To 
answer, you need to measure an interval of time that has both a 
beginning and an end. For example, you might measure how much 
time has passed between the start of a race and when the first runner 
crosses the finish line. A quantity of time is often called a time 
interval. A microwave oven with a built-in clock (Figure 1.7) displays 
both kinds of time: historical time and time intervals. In physical 
science, the word “time” will usually mean a time interval instead of 
historical time. 
Figure 1.6: There are two different ways 
to understand time.
Figure 1.7:  A microwave oven can 
understand time in either mixed units 
(minutes and seconds) or in a single unit 
(seconds). Both 1:30 and 0:90 will result in 
the same cooking time.

b) $1 per second for a month.

Units for Time
Units for
measuring time
You are probably familiar with the units for measuring time: seconds, 
minutes, hours, days, and years. But you may not know how they 
relate to each other. The table below gives some useful relationships 
between units of time. 
One second
The second (s) is the basic unit of time in both the English and metric 
systems. One second is about the time it takes to say “thousand.” 
There are 60 seconds in a minute and 3,600 seconds in an hour. The 
second was originally defined in terms of one day: There are 86,400 
seconds in an average day of 24 hours (86,400 = 3,600 x 24).
Mixed units
In everyday life, time is often expressed in mixed units. For example, 
the timer in Figure 1.8 shows the time for a race as 2 hours, 30 
minutes and 45 seconds. This time is in mixed units (hours, minutes, 
and seconds). People are used to hearing time this way. However, to 
do scientific calculations, you must convert the time into a single 
unit.
Converting time
to seconds
For most physical science problems, you will need to express time in 
seconds. When converting to seconds the first thing you do is convert 
each quantity of hours and minutes to seconds. Then you add up all 
the seconds to get the total. 
For example, 2 hours = 7,200 seconds. 30 minutes = 1,800 seconds. 
Therefore, 2:30:45 = 7,200 + 1,800 + 45 = 9,045 seconds.

1.2 TIME AND LENGTH
CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
Length and Distance
What is distance?
You can think of distance as the amount of space between two points, 
like the points of a pencil that has been sharpened on both ends. You 
probably have a good understanding of distance from everyday 
experiences, like the distance from one house to another, or the 
distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The concept of 
distance in science is the same, but the actual distances may be much 
larger and much smaller than anything you normally think about in 
your everyday life. 
Distance is
measured in
units of length
Distance is measured in units of length. Some of the commonly used 
units of length include inches, feet, miles, centimeters, kilometers, 
and meters. The metric (or SI) system uses millimeters (mm), 
centimeters (cm), meters (m), and kilometers (km). There are 10 
millimeters in a centimeter, 100 centimeters in a meter, and 1,000 
meters in a kilometer. The names of units in the metric system are 
based on multiplying by ten (Table 1.1). Almost all fields of science use 
metric units because they are easier to work with. 
Always include
units
It is important to always specify which length unit you are using for a 
measurement. All measurements must have units. Without a unit, a 
measurement cannot be understood. For example, if you asked 
someone to walk 10, she would not know how far to go: 10 feet, 10 
meters, 10 miles, 10 kilometers are all 10, but the units are different 
and therefore the distances are also different.

Measuring length
The meter stick
For ordinary lengths you must measure in the laboratory a meter 
stick is the most convenient tool to use. A meter stick is one meter 
long and has divisions of millimeters and centimeters. The diagram 
in Figure 1.10  shows a meter stick along with several different 
length objects.  Can you see how the meter stick is used to measure 
the length shown for each object?
Microscopic
lengths
For very small lengths, such as the 
size of a bacteria, scientists use 
measuring instruments that fit into a 
microscope.  The micron (μ) is a very 
tiny unit of length, appropriate to 
measuring tiny living creatures like 
bacteria.  There are one million 
microns in a meter.  The picture 
shows a single cell with a micron 
scale. Can you determine the length 
of the cell?
Geographic
lengths
For geographical lengths the most common metric unit is the 
kilometer.  One kilometer is equal to one thousand meters 
(1 km = 1,000 m).  A mile is longer than a kilometer.  In fact, one mile 
is a bit more than one and a half kilometers (1 mile = 1.6 km). 
Astronomical
lengths
Science also considers very large 
lengths, such as the distance between 
planets and stars. One astronomical 
unit (AU) is the distance between 
Earth and the sun, about 150 million 
kilometers. One light year is the 
distance light travels in one year, 
which is 9.5 trillion kilometers. The 
nearest star is 4.3 light years away 
from us.

1.2 TIME AND LENGTH
CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
Converting between units of length
The problem of
multiple units
It would be best (for science) if everyone always used the same unit for 
length, like the meter. Unfortunately, many different units of length 
are used for different things, and in different places. In California, you 
will find inches, feet and miles used more commonly than centimeters, 
meters and kilometers. In many problems you will need to translate a 
measurement in one unit into another unit. 
Comparing feet
and meters
For example, a backhoe on one tractor gives the maximum depth the 
tractor can dig as 1.83 meters (Figure 1.11). The contractor using the 
backhoe needs to dig a foundation for a house that is 8 feet deep. Can 
the backhoe do the job? 
Doing units
conversions
To answer the question you need to convert from feet to meters and 
then compare the distances in the same units. To do the conversion 
you multiply by conversion factors. A conversion factor is a ratio that 
has the value of one. That means the same length is on the top and 
bottom of the fraction. The trick is that the top and bottom are in 
different units. For example to convert 1.83 meters into feet you need 
a conversion factor that relates meters and feet. The table in 
Figure 1.12 gives two related conversion factors between feet and 
meters: 1 m / 3.28 ft and 1 foot / 0.305 m. The diagram below shows 
you what happens when you multiply 1.83 meters by both conversion 
factors. the correct answer is 6 feet. Can you tell why this answer is 
correct and the other one is not?
Figure 1.11: This backhoe 
specification gives the maximum depth 
the machine can dig in meters.

1.3 INQUIRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
1.3 Inquiry and the Scientific Method
We believe that the universe obeys a set of rules that we call natural laws. We believe 
that everything that happens everywhere obeys the same natural laws. Unfortunately, 
the natural laws are not written down nor are we born knowing them. The primary goal 
of science is to discover what the natural laws are. Over time, we have found the most 
reliable way to discover the natural laws is called scientific inquiry.
What inquiry means
Inquiry is
learning through
questions
Learning by asking questions is called inquiry. An inquiry is like a 
crime investigation in that there is a mystery to solve. With a crime, 
something illegal happened and the detective must figure out what it 
was. Solving the mystery means accurately describing what actually 
happened.
Deduction
One problem always is that the detective did not see what happened. 
The detective must deduce what happened in the past from 
information collected in the present. 
Theories
In the process of inquiry, the detective asks lots of questions related to 
the mystery. The detective searches for evidence and clues that help 
answer the questions. Eventually, the detective comes up with a 
theory about what happened that is a description of the crime and 
what occured down to the smallest details.
How you know
you have learned
the truth
At first, the detective’s theory is only one explanation among several 
of what might have happened. The detective must have proof that a 
theory describes what did happen. To be proven, a theory must pass 
three demanding tests. First, it must be supported by significant 
evidence. Second, there cannot be even a single piece of evidence that 
proves the theory is false. Third, the theory must be unique. If two 
theories both fit the facts equally well, you cannot tell which is correct. 
When the detective arrives at a theory that passes all three tests, he 
or she believes they have learned from their inquiry what happened. 
happened.
Figure 1.14: The steps in learning 
through inquiry.
natural laws - the set of rules 
that are obeyed by every detail of 
everything that occurs in the 
universe, including living creatures 
and human technology.
inquiry - a process of learning 
that starts with questions and 
proceeds by seeking the answers 
to the questions.
deduce - to figure something out 
from known facts using logical 
thinking. For example, “this is what 
happened ... because ...”.

UNIT 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Figure 1.15: A question that might 
begin an inquiry into what “heat” really 
is.
Many things in science were 
unknown 1,000 years ago. That 
doesn’t mean people didn’t know 
about qualities like temperature!  
Ancient people certainly knew the 
difference between hot and cold. 
What they did not know is the 
explanation for qualities such as 
hot or cold. People believed 
different things about these 
qualities than they do today.
Research a theory about 
something in science that was 
believed in the past and is no 
longer believed today. What 
evidence convinced people to 
change their minds?
Hot coffee
70  C
Cold coffee
21  C
What makes these two
cups of coffee different?
Scientific Theories and Natural Laws
How theories are
related to natural
laws
A scientific theory is a human attempt to describe a natural law. For 
example, if you leave a hot cup of coffee on the table eventually it will 
cool down. Why? There must be some natural law that explains what 
causes the coffee to cool. A good place to start looking for the answer 
is by asking what it is about the coffee that makes it hot. Whatever 
quality creates “hot” must go away or weaken as the coffee gets cool 
(Figure 1.15). The question of what heat is — not how to create it or 
what it feels like but what it is — puzzled people for a long time.
The theory of
caloric
Before 1843, scientists believed (a theory) that heat was a kind of 
fluid (like water) that flowed from hotter objects to colder objects. 
They called this fluid caloric. Hot objects had more caloric than cold 
objects. When you put a hot object in contact with a cold object, the 
caloric flowed between the two until the temperature was equal.
Testing the
theory
This theory was at first supported by the evidence. However, 
problems with the theory came up as soon as people learned  to 
measure weight accurately.  If caloric flowed from a hot object to a 
cold object, a hot object should weigh slightly more than the same 
object when it was cold. Experiments showed that this was not true. 
To the most precise measurements that could be made, an object had 
the same weight, hot or cold. The theory had to be changed because 
new evidence proved it could not be correct.
How theories are
tested against
evidence
Scientists continually test theories against new evidence.
1.
The current theory correctly explains the new evidence. This
gives us more confidence that the current theory is the right
one.
2.
The current theory does not explain the new evidence. This 
means scientists must revise the theory or come up with a 
completely new one that explains the new evidence as well as 
all the previous evidence, too.

1.3 INQUIRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
Theories and hypotheses
The hypothesis
In a criminal investigation, a good detective often proposes many 
possible but different theories for what might have happened. Each 
different theory is then compared with the evidence. The same is true 
in science, except that the word theory is reserved for a single 
explanation supported by lots of evidence collected over a long period 
of time. Instead of “theory” scientists use the word hypothesis to 
describe a possible explanation for a scientific mystery. 
Theories in
science are
hypotheses that
correctly explain
every bit of
evidence
Theories in science start out as hypotheses. The explanation of heat in 
terms of caloric is an incorrect hypothesis, one of many leading up to 
the modern theory of heat. The first hypothesis that heat was a form 
of energy was made by the German doctor, Julius Mayer in 1842, and 
confirmed by experiments done by James Joule in 1843. Energy has no 
weight so Mayer’s hypothesis explained why an object’s weight 
remained unchanged whether hot or cold. After many experiments, 
Mayer’s hypothesis (that heat was a form of energy) became the 
accepted theory of heat we believe today.
Hypotheses must
be testable to be
scientific
A scientific hypothesis must be testable. That means it must be 
possible to collect evidence that proves whether the hypothesis is true 
or false. This requirement means not all hypotheses can be considered 
by science. For instance, it has been believed at times that creatures 
are alive because of an undetectable “life force.” This is not a scientific 
hypothesis because there is no way to test it. If the “life force” is 
undetectable that means no evidence can be collected that would prove 
whether it existed or not. Science restricts itself only to those ideas 
which may be proved or disproved by actual evidence.
Figure 1.16: Eventually, scientists 
were able to deduce that heat is a form 
of energy. A hot cup of coffee has more 
heat energy than a cold cup of coffee. As 
coffee cools, it’s heat energy is 
transferred to the room. As a result, air 
in the room is warmed.
hypothesis - an unproved or 
preliminary explanation that can 
be tested by comparison with 
scientific evidence. Early 
hypotheses are rarely correct and 
are often modified as new 
evidence becomes available.

scientific method - a process of 
learning that begins with a 
hypothesis and proceeds to prove 
or change the hypothesis by 
comparing it with scientific 
evidence.
The Scientific Method
Learning by
chance
At first, humans learned about the world by trial and error, trying 
one thing at a time, like a small child attempting to open a jar. She 
will try what she knows: biting the lid, pulling on it, shaking the jar, 
dropping it … until, by chance, she twists the lid. It comes off. She 
puts it back and tries twisting it again — and the lid comes off again. 
The child learns by trying many things and remembering what works.
Learning by the
scientific method
It takes a long time to learn by randomly trying everything. What is 
worse, you can never be sure you tried everything. The scientific 
method is a much more dependable way to learn. 
The Scientific Method
1.
Scientists observe nature, then invent or revise hypotheses
about how things work.
2.
The hypotheses are tested against evidence collected from
observations and experiments. 
3.
Any hypothesis which correctly accounts for all of the evidence
from the experiments is a potentially correct theory.
4.
A theory is continually tested by collecting new and different
evidence. Even a single piece of evidence that does not agree
with a theory causes scientists to return to step one.
Why the scientific
method works
The scientific method is the underlying logic of science. It is basically 
a careful and cautious way to build a supportable, evidence-based 
understanding of our natural world. Each theory is continually tested 
against the results of observations and experiments. Such testing 
leads to continued development and refinement of theories to explain 
more and more different things. The way people learned about many 
things great and small, to the solar system and beyond, can be traced 
through many hypotheses (Figure 1.17).

19
1.3 INQUIRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
CHAPTER 1: STUDYING PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
Scientific evidence
What counts as
scientific
evidence?
The scientific method tells us the only sure way to know you are right 
is to compare what you think against evidence. However, what types 
of evidence qualify as scientific evidence? Do feelings or opinions count 
as scientific evidence? Does what other people think qualify as 
scientific evidence? The answer is no. Because evidence is so 
important in science, there are careful rules defining what counts as 
scientific evidence.
An example of
scientific
evidence
Scientific evidence may be measurements, data tables, graphs, 
observations, pictures, sound recordings, or any other information 
that describes what happens in the real world (Figure 1.18). Scientific 
evidence may be collected even without doing experiments in a 
laboratory. For example, Galileo used his telescope to observe the 
moon and recorded his observations by sketching what he saw. 
Galileo’s sketches are considered scientific evidence.
When is evidence
considered
scientific?
The two most important characteristics of scientific evidence are that 
it be objective and repeatable. “Objective” means the evidence should 
describe only what actually happened as exactly as possible. 
“Repeatable” means that others who repeat the same experiment the 
same way observe the same results. Scientific evidence must pass the 
tests of both objectivity and repeatability. Galileo’s sketches describe 
in detail what he actually saw through the telescope, therefore they 
pass the test of objectivity. Others who looked through his telescope 
saw the same thing, therefore the sketches pass the test of 
repeatability. Gallileo’s sketches convinced people that the Moon was 
actually a world like the Earth with mountains and valleys. This was 
not what people believed prior to Galileo’s time. 
Communicating
scientific
evidence
It is important that scientific evidence be communicated clearly, with 
no room for misunderstanding.  For this reason, in science we must 
define concepts like “force” and “weight” very clearly. Usually, the 
scientific definition is similar to the way you already use the word, but 
more exact. For example, your “weight” in science means the force of 
gravity pulling on the mass of your body.
Figure 1.18: Some examples of 
scientific evidence.
objective - describes evidence 
that documents only what actually 
happened as exactly as possible.
repeatable - describes evidence 
that can be seen independently by 
others if they repeat the same 
experiment or observation in the 
same way.

20
UNIT 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
You use inquiry and the scientific 
method every day, only you 
probably do not realize it. Write 
down three things you have 
learned in your life by being 
curious and testing your ideas for 
yourself.
Problem-solving in the real world 
often involves things that are not 
written down. For example, 
suppose you have a flashlight. You 
turn on the switch, and nothing 
happens. There is no light.
List two potential reasons why the 
flashlight might not work. These 
are your hypotheses.
Give at least one way to test each 
hypothesis to see if it is the correct 
one. Each test is an experiment 
that produces scientific evidence 
that allows you to evaluate the 
hypothesis.
It is not hard to fix a flashlight by 
doing the things you just wrote 
down. This is the scientific method 
as applied to every day problem-
solving.
Learning science through inquiry
What learning
through inquiry
means
The goal of this book is to help you learn science through inquiry. 
This means you will be asked questions instead of being given 
answers. You will be asked to propose explanations (hypotheses) for 
things that you see. And like your most ancient ancestors and the 
most modern detectives, and almost everyone in between, not all your 
explanations will be correct. In inquiry, getting the right answer 
immediately is not important. What is important is having a possible 
answer that can be tested to see whether it is right or not. You will be 
given ways (investigations) to collect evidence so you can decide 
which hypotheses are correct and which are not.
Why not just tell
you the answers?
Of course, you could just read the answers in the book and skip all 
the thinking and testing. There are two major reasons why learning 
through inquiry is a better way. For one, just reading the answers in 
a book is boring and you are unlikely to remember them anyway.
Inquiry  teaches
you how to use
science
The most important reason to learn through inquiry is that someday, 
maybe tomorrow, you will be stumped by something that does not 
work in your life outside the classroom. It is very unlikely this book or 
any book will have taught you to fix the exact thing that has you 
stumped. Inquiry teaches you how to learn how almost anything 
works. Once you know how something works, you can often figure out 
how to make it work for you. This is called problem-solving and it is 
an extraordinarily useful skill. In fact, problem-solving is the most 
important thing you will learn in this course. Simple answers, like the  
temperature of Mars can always be looked up in a book. Inquiry  
teaches you how to use the answers to solve your problems and 
become successful.

left on the table in a cooler room.
b. Enrique wonders what happens to hot objects if you remove 
them from the stove. He puts a thermometer in a cup of hot 
coffee and observes that the coffee cools off.
Keep your eyes and ears open to 
the world
A great many discoveries were 
made almost by accident! For 
example, paper used to be made 
of cotton or linen. Both of these are 
plant fibers and are very 
expensive. Many inventors 
searched for a better and less 
expensive way to make paper. In 
1719 French scientist and inventor 
Rene de Reaumer was walking in 
the woods when he noticed that 
wasp nests were made from 
something a lot like paper! How did 
the wasps do it? Reaumer 
discovered that the wasps used 
wood fibers to make paper. 
Reaumer began experimenting 
with a way  to make paper from 
wood, like the wasps. It was trickier 
than he realized and it was not 
until 1840 that Friedrich Keller 
made the first all wood paper. 
However, Reaumer’s curiosity and 
alert eyes lead directly to the 
modern, wood-based paper we 
use today.

22
The Art and Sole of Scientific Thinking
When you are playing a sport, how often do you think about 
your shoes? If they are “working” properly, you shouldn’t 
think about them at all. This is no accident, either. Your 
athletic shoes have been scientifically designed and 
engineered.
Not that long ago, athletic shoes were relatively crude. They 
were made of leather or canvas. They had cleats if they were 
used on grass and rubber soles if they were used on hard 
surfaces. What they did not have was much cushioning to 
protect athletes’ feet and legs and knees and hips from the 
impact of running and jumping, starting and stopping.
Using the scientific method
Today’s athletic shoes are high-tech. Scientists and 
engineers are constantly studying the forces that act on the 
feet and legs of athletes in various sports and using those 
studies to redesign and improve footwear. 
So how do scientists and engineers work together to study 
and improve running shoes - or any other product? They use 
the scientific method. The scientific method helps ensure 
that new shoe designs actually improve performance.
Remember, the scientific method begins with observations 
that lead to questions. For example: “how can a shoe reduce 
the impact force on a runner’s foot?” A design engineer 
proposes answers to the questions, such as “this new shape 
of wedge should lessen impact force”. The designer’s 
proposed answer is a testable hypothesis because it includes 
a prediction that can be tested by actual measurements. In 
the instance of a running shoe, the engineer does 
experiments that measure the impact forces with the new 
wedge shape. The measurements can then be compared to 
other shapes.  
This process of scientific thinking is applied to all aspects of 
the research and testing of athletic shoes at the Orthopaedic 
Biomechanics Laboratories (OBL) at Michigan State 
University, in East Lansing, Mich. The OBL is a unique 
facility that has won recognition for its excellence in science 
research. 
Building a better running shoe
Modern athletic shoes are specialized for various sports, and 
the running shoe may be the most specialized and highly 
engineered of all. Running puts great stress on the feet and 
legs because of the repeated motion and impact. Many 
runners develop stress injuries. As running has become more 
popular both as a way to exercise and in competition, 
millions of people are relying on - and investing in - shoes 
that will keep them going.  
Is there a connection between the shoes runners wear and 
the injuries they develop? The OBL conducts experiments on 
athletic shoes in order to study their durability, comfort, and 
the protection they provide from injury. In terms of the 
Chapter 1 Connection

23
UNIT 1  PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
scientific method, this is an observable fact. Researchers can 
hypothesize whether shoes can reduce the natural stresses of 
running on the feet and legs. By observing runners, they see 
that a runner’s heel hits the ground first, then the foot rolls 
forward, and lastly the runner pushes off on the forefoot. 
Early experiments measured the forces of these actions. It 
was calculated that the heel strikes the ground with a force 
equal to two or three times the body weight of the runner. 
Scientists hypothesized that the materials in a running 
shoe’s sole would affect how a runner pushes off on the 
forefoot. Testing this prediction with different variables, 
they discovered that the forefoot pushed off with more spring 
when the sole of the shoe was flexible. 
Scientists predicted that if a shoe allowed a person to run 
more efficiently, stress-related injuries would be less 
probable. This led to the general hypothesis that shoes with 
well-cushioned heels and flexible soles would reduce injuries 
in runners. 
From running shoes to turkey bones?
Because of their special expertise, the biologists, engineers, 
and clinicians at the OBL work on many projects involving 
the musculo-skeletal system of both humans and animals.  
For example, Dr. 
Roger Haut, the 
labs’ director, 
worked on 
turkeys! Turkeys 
raised on big farms 
develop so fast 
that they actually 
outgrow their bone 
structure. In an 
average week, 1% 
of farm turkeys 
break their 
femurs. Farmers can lose almost 20% of their flock as a 
result of this problem. Dr. Haut and his staff at OBL 
conducted a series of experiments to determine the strength 
of turkey femurs. They are are researching ways to improve 
the turkeys’ bone strength. 
Whether it be research on a runner’s bones or a turkey’s, the 
scientific method is the foundation. Now you know there is 
more to your athletic shoe than just good looks.
Questions: 
1. What is the first step in the scientific method? 
2. What are the main qualities of a good hypothesis? 
3. What general hypothesis did scientists make about 
running shoes?

lab?

Make a Water Clock
A clock is a tool used to measure time.  Inside a clock are 
parts that move with a constant repetition.  We can record a 
quantity of time by counting how many “movements” of our 
clock occur during an interval of time that has a beginning 
and an end.  The number of movements gives us our time 
measurement.  In this activity, you and a partner will make 
your own clock and measure time with it.
Materials
Two empty 2-liter soda bottles
400 mL beaker
Water
Duct tape
Stopwatch
Making your clock
1. Put three beakers of water (1200 mL) 
into one of the empty soda bottles.
2. Attach the mouths of the two soda 
bottles together and seal them with 
duct tape.
3. Turn the two attached soda bottles 
upside down so that the water runs 
from one soda bottle to the other.
4. Seal your bottles with more duct tape if 
you have any leaks.

Experiments and Variables
On Aug. 21, 2003, on a specially built hill in 
Irvine, California, six adults climbed into cars 
with no motors and rolled downhill. Called the 
Extreme Gravity Race, the cars reached 
speeds of up to 60 miles per hour as they raced down the hill 
using nothing but gravity for energy. Fiercely competitive, each 
of the six cars represented a different design and engineering 
team. The race featured teams from five different automakers. 
Each team had created the slipperiest, low-friction car they 
could, using carbon fiber, titanium and many high-tech 
materials.
How did the cars reach such high speeds using nothing but 
gravity? How did each design team evaluate its car so that it 
would be as fast as possible? Answers to these questions involve 
experiments and variables. Read on, and you will find out how 
people learn to make things better, faster, or more efficient!

At the moment in the picture, the depth 
is 100 meters.
variable - a quantity that can be 
precisely specified, often with a 
numerical value. For example, 
position and speed are variables.
value - the particular number (with 
units) or choice that a variable may 
have.
2.1 Variables and Relationships
Imagine you are in a submarine exploring the deepest part of the ocean. There is no 
light. You cannot see anything around you. How do you know where you are? How do 
you tell the rest of your exploration team where you are? What you need is a way to 
precisely describe where you are at every moment and communicate this information to  
your fellow explorers. When scientists need to communicate precise information they use 
variables. A variable is a quantity that can be precisely described, such as the depth of a 
submarine.
What is a variable?
Variables and
values
A variable is a quantity that has a value which describes something. 
For example, color is a variable. If you are choosing a car to buy, color 
is often an important variable. For a particular car, the values of 
color could be red, blue, brown, black, or yellow. The variable color 
represents all possible choices and a value, red, is a specific choice. 
When talking about the car, it is clearest to use the variable (color) to 
describe all possible values. For example, you would say,“What colors 
do you have?” It is much more difficult to list all possible colors one at 
a time: “Do you have silver?” “Do you have blue?” “Do you have 
brown?” “Do you have black?” “Do you …?”
Variables often
have values of
numbers with
units
In science, many variables represent numbers with units. In the 
example in Figure 2.1, the depth below the surface is a variable. The 
name of the variable is depth. The value can be any number between 
zero (at the surface) and the distance between the surface and the 
bottom. For example, you could specify your depth as 100 meters. 
Mathematically, you would write this as depth = 100 m. If your team 
calls on the radio and asks, “What is your depth?”, they are asking for 
the value of the variable depth at that exact moment. You would 
respond, “My depth is 100 meters.”

experiments
Consider doing an experiment with a small car that rolls along a 
straight track (Figure 2.2). What variables affect the motion of the car 
in this system? What kinds of values can each variable take? What 
kinds of instruments are used to measure the variables?
Mass
Mass is an important variable in many experiments. Mass is 
measured with a balance and has units of grams or kilograms.
Time
Time is an important variable in many experiments. In your 
investigations, time is measured in seconds using a stopwatch or 
photogate timer.
Position
Position is another important variable. Position is measured in meters 
or centimeters (Figure 2.3).
Angle
Angle is another important variable. The track may be set at different 
angles. The car will travel at different speeds depending on the angle 
at which you set the track.
Temperature
In your investigations in chemistry, you also will measure different 
variables. For example, temperature is a variable that is important in 
many experiments. Temperature is measured with a thermometer and 
has units of degrees Celsius (°C) or degrees Fahrenheit (°F).
Volume
Volume is a variable that you will use to measure liquids like water. 
Volume is measured in cubic centimeters (cc) or milliliters (mL). One 
cubic centimeter is the same as one milliliter. Graduated cylinders 
and syringes are used to measure volume in different experiments.

Graphs show relationships between variables
Relationships
between
variables
Physical science is all about relationships between variables. For 
example, you are rolling a car down the track. You suspect that 
increasing the angle would make the car go between points A and B 
in less time. How do you find out if your suspicion is correct? You 
need to know the relationship between the variables angle and time.
Patterns on a
graph show
relationships
A good way to show a relationship between two variables is to use a 
graph. A graph is a mathematical diagram that shows one variable 
on the vertical (or y) axis and a second variable on the horizontal 
(or x) axis. Each axis is labeled with the range of values the variable 
has. In Figure 2.4, the x-axis (angle) has data values between zero 
and 50 degrees. The y-axis (time) has data values between zero and 
0.3286 seconds. You can tell there is a relationship because the graph 
is a curve that slopes down and to the right.
Recognizing a
relationship from
a graph
Two variables may have a strong relationship, a weak relationship, 
or no relationship at all. In a strong relationship, large changes in 
one variable make proportionately large changes in the other 
variable, like in Figure 2.4. When there is no relationship, the graph 
looks like scattered dots (below left).  A weak relationship is in 
between strong and none, meaning large changes in one variable 
cause only small changes in the other.

2.1 VARIABLES AND RELATIONSHIPS
CHAPTER 2: EXPERIMENTS AND VARIABLES
Direct and inverse relationships
Direct
relationships
In a direct relationship, when one variable increases, the other also 
increases. For example, if you add a volume of water to water already 
in a beaker, the mass of water increases. The relationship between 
mass and volume is a direct relationship. Graphs showing direct 
relationships usually slope up and to the right, like the graph in 
Figure 2.5.  This is also called a linear relationship.
Inverse
relationships
In an inverse relationship, when one variable increases, the other 
decreases. For example, suppose you put one kilogram of water on the 
stove for 10 minutes. The temperature of the water increases. If you 
put two kilograms of water on the same stove for the same time, the 
temperature would increase only half as much because the heat is 
spread out over twice the amount of water. The relationship between 
temperature and mass for this experiment is an inverse relationship. 
The graph of an inverse relationship often slopes down to the left, like 
the graph in Figure 2.6.
Relationships
involving
more than two
variables
Many natural laws relate three or more variables. In fact, the example 
of the stove involves three variables: mass, time, and temperature. 
When more than two variables are involved you must do careful 
planning to figure out the relationships. For example, to figure out the 
relationship between mass and temperature, you should keep the time 
the same. It is easiest to figure out the relationships between 
individual variables by changing them only one at a time.
Complex
relationships
Some relationships are neither direct 
nor inverse. The graph on the left 
shows the distance a soccer ball flies 
when kicked at different angles. The 
maximum distance is near 45 degrees. 
Increasing the angle past 45 degrees 
decreases the distance. Decreasing the 
angle below 45 degrees also decreases 
the distance. This is a nonlinear 
relationship.
Figure 2.5: The relationship between 
mass and volume of water is an example 
of a direct relationship.
Figure 2.6: If heating time is kept 
constant, the relationship between 
temperature change and mass is an 
inverse relationship.

independent variable - in an 
experiment, a variable that is 
changed by the experimenter    
and/or causes changes in the 
dependent variable.
dependent variable - in an 
experiment, a variable that  
responds to changes in the 
independent variable.
4 steps to making a graph
Step 1: Choose which will be the 
dependent and independent 
variables. The dependent 
variable goes on the y-axis and 
the independent variable goes on 
the x-axis.
Step 2: Make a scale for each 
axis by counting boxes to fit your 
largest value. Count by multiples 
of 1, 2, 5, or 10.
Step 3: Plot each point by 
finding the x-value and drawing 
a line upward until you get to the 
right y-value.
Step 4: Draw a smooth curve 
that shows the pattern of the 
points. Do not just connect the 
dots.
Designing a graph: dependent and independent variables
What to put
on the x- and
y-axes
To a scientist, a graph is a language that shows the relationship 
between two variables. Graphs are drawn a certain way just like 
words are spelled a certain way. The first rule in making a correct 
graph is to choose which variables to put on which axis.
The independent
variable
Graphs are usually created to show a cause and effect relationship 
between two variables. A graph makes it easy to see if changes in one 
variable cause changes in the other variable (the effect). The variable 
that causes the change is called the independent variable. In an 
experiment, this is the variable that the experimenter is free to 
change. By agreement among scientists, the independent variable goes 
on the x-axis. In the example, mass is the independent variable so 
mass goes on the x-axis (horizontal). 
The dependent
variable
The dependent variable shows the effect of changes in the 
independent variable. The dependent variable goes on the y-axis. In 
the example, temperature is the dependent variable and therefore 
goes on the y-axis (vertical).
If time is
a variable
Time is often an exception to the rule about which variable goes on 
which axis. Time usually goes on the x-axis even though you may not 
think of time as an independent variable.

2.1 VARIABLES AND RELATIONSHIPS
CHAPTER 2: EXPERIMENTS AND VARIABLES
Reading a graph
Using a graph to
make a prediction
Suppose you want to find out what the temperature of 1.5 kilograms of 
water would be after 10 minutes on the stove. But you only measured 
the temperature with 1 and 2 kilograms, not with 1.5 kilograms. The 
graph can give you an accurate answer even without your doing the 
experiment.
Large graphs are
more precise
to read
For this example, the graph predicts the temperature to be 20°C. Predictions 
are more accurate when the graph is large enough to read precisely. That is 
why it is a good idea to make your graphs fill as much of the page as you can.
A graph is a form
of model
A graph is a simple form of model. Remember, a model is a relationship that 
connects two or more variables. Scientists use models to make and test 
predictions.
1)
Start by finding 1.5 kg on the x-axis.
2)
Draw a line vertically upward from 1.5 kg until it hits 
the curve representing what you actually measured.
3)
Draw a line across horizontally to the y-axis.
4)
Use the scale on the y-axis to read the predicted 
temperature.
A student 
measures the 
mass of water 
collected every 
five minutes on 
a rainy day. 
Design a graph 
to show the 
student’s data. Once you have the 
graph, estimate when 20 grams of 
water was collected.
Time is the independent variable, 
therefore mass is the dependent 
variable. The mass axis should go 
from 0 to at least 50 grams. The 
time axis should go from 0 to at 
least 20 minutes. The graph shows 
that 20 grams of rainwater fell in 
the first 7.5 minutes.

Using math to describe relationships between variables
Math is the
language of
variables
Math is the best language to describe relationships between 
variables. A graph is good for getting a quick picture of a relationship. 
However, math is more accurate and more useful. Like any foreign 
language, you have to learn to read and write math before it can be 
useful to you. Math allows us to solve problems as routine as 
balancing a checkbook or as complicated as landing a robot on Mars. 
Using letters to
represent
variables
When you write out a relationship in math, you use a single letter or 
symbol to represent each variable. For example, what is the 
relationship between volume and size for a box? The diagram below 
shows the relationship written out two ways.
Operations
The relationships between variables are represented in math by 
operations. Four operations you know are: add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide. To show addition or subtraction you put the symbol 
between the variables. However, there are two ways to represent 
multiplication and division. In fact, you will rarely see the multiply or 
divide symbol. Instead, two variables written right next to each other 
mean they should be multiplied together. Two variables on top of 
each other mean the top one is divided by the bottom one. All four 
operations are shown in Figure 2.7.
Formulas
A formula is a relationship that gives one variable in terms of other 
variables. Think of each variable as a box to hold the value of that 
variable. To use the formula, you substitute actual values for the 
corresponding variables.  Then add, subtract, multiply, or divide the 
numbers as directed by the formula. In this book, important formulas 
will be shown as “cards” with the variables and their units identified 
(Figure 2.8).

35
2.1 VARIABLES AND RELATIONSHIPS
CHAPTER 2: EXPERIMENTS AND VARIABLES
Solving for one variable in terms of the others
Using a formula
A formula is an exact description of the relationship between 
variables. Formulas allow you to calculate any one variable if you 
know the values of the others. This is easiest when the variable you 
want is by itself on one side of the equal sign (=). For example, the 
volume (V) of a box is length (l) × width (w) × height (h). If you know 
the length, width, and height, you plug values in for the variables and 
do the multiplication as directed by the formula (Figure 2.9).
Solving an
equation
In many problems the variable you want is not by itself. Getting the 
variable you want by itself is known as solving the equation (equation 
being another word for formula). Suppose the box must have a volume 
of 1,500 cubic centimeters — about the right size to hold a coffee cup. 
You want the box to be 10 centimeters wide and 15 centimeters long. 
How high should the box be?
Solving an
equation with
values
Let’s do the problem with numbers first. To calculate the required 
height, write down the formula substituting the values you know. 
Next, do the operations you can. For example, multiply 15 times 10. 
Last, divide both sides by 150. Dividing by 150 cancels out the 150 on 
the right-hand side of the formula, leaving only the variable h 
(height), which gives you the solution: h = 10 cm.
Solving an
equation with
algebra
We can also solve the problem using algebra to rearrange the formula. 
Once you have the formula in the form “h = ...” then you can plug in 
the numbers and find the required height. Many problems must be 
solved this way because the relationships are too complex to calculate 
using just numbers.

Solving math problems is a lot like 
playing a game. As in all games, 
there are rules you have to follow. 
You win the game when you get 
the variable you want all by itself 
on one side of the equals sign. 
Here are a few of the rules:
Rule 1: Anything you do on the left 
of the equals sign (=) you must 
also do on the right. If you subtract 
10 from the left, you must also 
subtract 10 from the right. If you 
divide the left by w, you must also 
divide the right by w.

2.2 EXPERIMENTS AND DATA
CHAPTER 2: EXPERIMENTS AND VARIABLES
2.2 Experiments and Data
If you wish to know someone’s name, it’s easy enough to ask, “What is your name?”, and 
get a simple answer: “Sandra.” If you want to know how something works in science, the 
questions are not so easy because the answers are not so easy. Earlier we talked about 
the importance of inquiry. Inquiry is how science is learned. Inquiry is built around 
questions, and doing experiments is how scientists learn the answers to questions about 
nature and technology. 
Experiments provide the test of truth
Experiments
An experiment is a situation specially set up to investigate the 
relationships between specific variables. Scientists do experiments to 
gather evidence so they can evaluate their ideas. An example of an 
idea (or hypothesis) could be: “The temperature of water increases 
proportional to the amount of time you apply heat.” One way a 
scientist could test this idea is with an experiment that measured the 
temperature of water at different times while heat was applied. 
The importance
of experiments
Experiments are important in science because experiments are the test 
of whether a hypothesis is correct or not.
In science, a hypothesis is correct ONLY if it 
agrees with the results of actual experiments.
Something is true in science ONLY if it agrees with what actually 
happens. People’s opinions of what did or should or could happen are 
NOT scientific tests of what is true and what is not true. The best way 
to test a theory or hypothesis is to do experiments that provide 
scientific evidence.
Observations
may substitute
for experiments
There are times when experiments cannot be done, such as in 
astronomy. Then a theory may be tested by comparing predictions of 
the theory with observations of what occurs in nature (Figure 2.14). 
Figure 2.13: An experiment to test 
the hypothesis that the temperature of  
water increases proportional to the 
amount of time you apply the heat. 
Figure 2.14: There are several 
competing theories for how the solar 
system formed. Solar systems cannot be 
re-created in experiments so the theories 
are tested by comparing them with 
observations of the actual solar system.

ideas with others.

observation.
Designing a good experiment
The importance
of experiment
design
A good experiment is carefully planned and carried out. If the 
experiment is well designed, the results will help you learn what you 
want to know. If the experiment is poorly designed, the results may 
fool you into believing the wrong things. Many people have been 
mistaken and confused by results of poorly designed experiments.
The hypothesis
The first step in designing a good experiment is to clearly state what 
you want to test (the hypothesis). Remember, a hypothesis is a 
tentative statement about how or why something happens. For 
example, “Cars rolling down steep ramps go faster than those rolling 
down shallow ramps” is a good hypothesis. It is good because it may 
be tested by doing an experiment (Figure 2.15).
The procedure
The second step is to plan how you will test your hypothesis. This 
part of experiment design is called the procedure. A good procedure 
describes the equipment you use, the techniques you use, and the 
data you collect from the experiment. For example, you could 
measure the time it takes a car to roll between two photogates as you 
vary the angle of the ramp. The procedure should contain enough 
information for someone else to repeat your experiment the exact 
same way you did.
Data
The purpose of experiments is to collect scientific evidence. In many 
experiments the scientific evidence will be data. Data are usually the 
values of variables that you measure during an experiment. For 
example, the ramp angle and time between photogates are data. 
Analysis and
conclusion
Once you collect your data, you need to analyze it. Analyzing 
includes thinking about, graphing, or doing calculations with the 
data. If your experiment was successful, your analysis will lead you 
to a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement of what you learned 
from the experiment. A conclusion must always be supported by data 
and analysis. For example, that cars roll faster down steeper ramps is 
a conclusion supported by data that shows what the cars did on 
ramps of various heights in the experiment.

39
2.2 EXPERIMENTS AND DATA
CHAPTER 2: EXPERIMENTS AND VARIABLES
Experimental and control variables
Only one variable
is changed in an
ideal experiment
In an ideal experiment only a single variable is changed at a time. If 
anything happens in the experiment, you can then assume what 
happened was caused by the variable you changed. On the other hand, 
if you make many changes at once, you will never be able to sort out 
which one caused what happened. The experiment will still work, you 
just won’t be able to understand its results.
The experimental
variable
The variable you allow to change in an experiment is called the 
experimental variable. This is usually the variable that you have 
direct control over. Going back to the experiment with a car on a ramp, 
the angle of the ramp is the experimental variable. 
Control variables
In real experiments there are often many variables that matter. If 
only one variable is allowed to change, then the others must be kept 
constant. Constant means NOT allowed to change. Variables that are 
kept constant are called control variables. Many variables affect the 
car on the ramp. For example, changing the mass of the car, pushing 
it, or releasing it from a different position all change how quickly the 
car moves between the photogates. If you want to test the effect of 
steeper ramps you need to ensure that the ramp angle is the only 
variable that changes. The mass and release position should stay the 
same for every angle you test. Mass and release position are control 
variables in this experiment.
Identifying the
experimental
variable
In some tests you may be asked to identify the experimental variable 
by looking at data collected in an experiment. The most reliable way to 
do this has two steps: 
Step 1)
Eliminate all the variables that remain constant       
since these are controlled variables.
Step 2)
Of the remaining variables, the experimental variable 
is the one the experimenter has changed — and often in  
equal steps, such as every 2 minutes or every 5 
centimeters.

experimental variables for the effect of 
angle on the time between photogates.

experimental variable because it 
changes and is set by the experimenter.

accuracy - describes how close a 
measurement is to the true value.
error - the difference between a 
measurement and the true value.
average - a mathematical 
process in which you add up all the 
values, then divide the result by 
the number of values.
Accuracy, errors, and averages
Accuracy
In science, the word accuracy means how close a measurement is to 
the true value of what is being measured. For example, suppose it 
takes a car exactly 0.125 seconds to pass between two photogates. 
You have no way to know the exact true time. The best you can do is 
make a measurement and assume that your measurement is the true 
time. The table in Figure 2.18 shows several measurements of the 
time made by different students using different techniques. Which is 
the most accurate? Which is the least accurate?
Error
In your experiments with motion you will use a photogate timer to 
make measurements to the nearest 0.0001 seconds. You will notice 
that you rarely get the exact same time three times in a row even if 
you do the exact same thing. This is because any measurement always 
contains some error. Error is the difference between a measurement 
and the true value of what you are trying to measure. The errors are 
small if the experiment is accurate.
The average
When you make many measurements of the same thing you will 
notice that they cluster around an average value. Some 
measurements are more than the average and some are less. To 
calculate the average you add up all the measurements and divide by 
the number of measurements you have. For example, the average of 
the times in Figure 2.18 is 0.1253 seconds.
Why taking the
average is useful
The average of several measurements is usually more accurate than 
a single measurement. The average is more accurate because errors 
in the negative direction partially cancel errors in the positive 
direction. 

41
2.2 EXPERIMENTS AND DATA
CHAPTER 2: EXPERIMENTS AND VARIABLES
Reproducibility: When are two results the same?
A new condition
for
reproducibility
In Chapter 1 we said one of the criteria for scientific evidence was that 
it be reproducible. Reproducibility means two things that we can now 
discuss more carefully.
1.
Others who repeat the same experiment get the same result
(which is what we said in Chapter 1).
2.
If you repeat the experiment the same way, you always get the
same result.
When different
numbers are
“the same”
According to rule number 2, an experiment is most reproducible when 
errors are small. However, even small errors are still errors. This 
brings up an important question: How can you tell if two results are 
the same when both results have errors in them? The word “same” 
when applied to experimental measurements does not mean what it 
does in ordinary conversation. Two measurements are considered the 
same if their difference is less than or equal to the amount of error. 
This is important to remember. 
Two measurements are considered the same if their 
difference is less than or equal to the amount of error.
How to estimate
the error
How can we know the error if we do not know the true value of a 
measurement? The way scientists estimate the error is to assume the 
average is the true value. The error is roughly the largest difference 
between the average and a measured value. The number line below 
shows Group 1’s (sidebar) data with the estimated error.
0.3349
0.3356
0.3352
0.3351
Group 1 Data
Two groups of students do an 
experiment in which they measure 
the time it takes a car to roll 
between two photogates. Each 
group makes four measurements 
and takes the average. One group 
claims its results are the same. 
The other group claims its results 
are different. Who is right?
You need to know the size of the 
error. For both groups, the largest 
difference beween the average 
and a measured value is 0.0004. 
Therefore, the error is 
approximately +/- 0.0004 seconds.
The difference between the two 
groups’ results is only 0.0003 
seconds. This difference is NOT 
greater than the error, therefore, 
scientifically, the results are the 
same.

whether the shape of a car has an effect 
on its speed going downhill.
significant - a difference 
between two measured results is 
significant if the difference is 
greater than the error in 
measurement.
Drawing conclusions from data
We do
experiments
to reach
conclusions
The point of experiments is to produce data that allows a scientist 
(like you) to come to a conclusion. The conclusion tells whether your 
idea, the hypothesis, is right or not. You need to know about errors 
before you can make a conclusion. For example, suppose you think 
that pointy cars roll faster down a hill. An experiment tests cars with 
different shapes by measuring the time between two photogates. 
Your hypothesis (pointy cars roll faster) predicts that the time 
between photogates should be less for the pointy car.
A sloppy
experiment
One group rolls each car once and records the time in a data table 
(Figure 2.19). Their results show a shorter time for the pointy car. 
This seems to confirm the hypothesis. Are they right? Have they 
proved that pointy cars go faster?
A better
experiment
Scientifically there is no way to tell if the time difference for Group 1 
is significant or not. A difference is only significant if the difference 
is greater than the amount of error. The same experiment is also 
done by a second group. The second group did five identical trials for 
each shape. Doing identical trials allowed the second group to 
estimate its errors. The largest difference between the average and a 
measured value is 0.0007 for the blunt car and 0.0006 for the pointy 
car. 
When differences
are significant
The second group can say that, scientifically, the data do NOT show 
that pointy cars are faster. At the speeds in their experiment, the 
shape of the car made no significant difference. In fact, shape only 
starts to become an important factor at speeds at least five times 
higher than those you will observe in your investigations.
How numbers
can be different
but still the same
Two results are significantly different only when the difference 
between them is greater than the error. This is an important 
consideration because experiments rarely produce exactly the same 
numbers twice in a row. Numbers that are “different” in a 
mathematical sense may not be significantly different in a scientific 
sense.

Testing the Power of Suggestion 
Have you ever bought one brand of a common item instead of 
another, just because you heard a name in an ad? We all do 
that. Ads sometimes influence us through the power of 
suggestion. We recognize the name of the product. We may 
not be sure why. And then we buy the product. 
When the power of suggestion occurs in medicine, it is called 
the “placebo effect.” A placebo is a substance that has no 
healing properties. Yet this same substance causes a 
patient’s condition to improve. Why? Because he or she 
believes it has the power to do so. This is 
the placebo effect. 
Is it real? One way to try to 
find out is through a 
scientific experiment. This 
will test the hypothesis. A 
hypothesis is an idea that is 
based on evidence and that, 
most importantly, can be 
tested. In this case, the 
hypothesis is that the 
placebo effect is real. People 
who take a placebo for an 
illness will get well. 
Let’s imagine an 
experiment that will test 
the placebo effect. The 
hypothesis will be tested on 
a group of people that, or 
“subjects.” All of the people in the experiment need to believe 
that they are receiving the same treatment for the same 
problem. They need to believe that they are all being treated 
in exactly the same way. This is called a “blind” test. The 
subjects do not know if they are receiving a medicine or other 
treatment or a placebo.
For our experiment, let’s assume our subjects are concerned 
about catching a colds. They all believe that taking high 
doses of vitamin C helps prevent colds. Some of the subjects 
will be given a placebo, but they will believe it is vitamin C. 
If the placebo effect is real, everyone in the experiment 
should catch fewer colds. It should not matter if a subject is 
taking vitamin C or not. 
Test the hypothesis 
Half of the subjects will receive vitamin C pills. The other 
half will take pills that look the same but are placebos. For 
example, they might be made of powdered sugar. 
To test the effect, all of the subjects take the “vitamin” pills 
for a month. We record how all of them respond to the pills. 
This becomes our experimental data. At the end of the 
experiment, which group caught fewer colds? If there is no 
difference, the placebo effect may be real.
To test the hypothesis further, we would also follow up. 
When the experiment ends and the powdered sugar is no 
longer being given to half of the test subjects, do the number 
of colds caught by the subjects go up?
If so, then we have more evidence to support our hypothesis. 
What were the results when the subjects believed they were 
taking vitamin C? How do those results compare with what 
happened when they stopped taking the pills? This is the 
point of comparison.

UNIT 1  PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Keep conditions the same
For a good scientific experiment, other factors must also be 
considered. As experimenters, we need to be sure that 
conditions are the same at every point in the experiment. For 
example, how did the weather change? Did any subject’s 
overall well-being change (with, for instance, a death in the 
family, a broken arm, a job loss, for instance)? Were the 
subjects getting the same amount of rest before and after you 
gave them the pills? Were the subjects eating the same types 
of food before and after? These factors are called “variables.” 
For the experiment to be a success, the variables need to be 
controlled.
Let’s assume everything was controlled in our experiment. 
The placebo effect is real. A person believes that a treatment 
will work. Then it is suggested that this type of treatment 
will work. The hypothesis is tested using controlled, 
observable, scientific methods and the results are measured.
Before a new drug can be sold, it must prove to be more 
effective against a disease than a placebo.
Real or imagined?
Some scientists believe the placebo 
effect is a myth. Simple experiments 
like one discussed cannot prove that 
the effect is real. This is because all 
of the variables cannot be controlled. 
Does taking the placebo reduce a 
subject’s anxiety? Does it bring 
down stress levels? Does the extra 
attention and care the subject 
receives affect the results? Do 
encouraging messages trigger the subject’s response to the 
placebo? 
Variables play an important role in the outcome of any 
experiment. Most often, even the doctor conducting the test 
does not know which subjects are receiving a placebo. This 
type of test is known as a double-blind study. It means both 
the subject and the experimenter are “blind” about who is 
receiving a placebo. This is how new drugs are tested before 
they are sold. 
Whether or not you believe in the placebo effect, it is 
important for all experiments to be objective. Using a 
placebo helps keep experiments with human subjects 
objective because it separates the actual effects of a medicine 
from effects caused by how a patient feels about a medicine. 
A doctor’s attitude about a medication can also effect how it 
works in a patient. Using the double-blind technique is a 
second way of maintaining objectivity because it separates 
the doctor’s own opinions form the results of the experiment.
Questions: 
1. Why are drugs tested in double-blind studies?
2. What is the placebo effect? 
3. What is a hypothesis? 
4. How is a “double-blind” study set up?

Guess the Gram
Mass is the measure of the amount of matter an object 
contains. An object’s mass is related to its size (volume) and 
the density of the material from which it is made. Common 
units for measuring mass include the gram and kilogram. 
One kilogram is equal to 1000 grams. In this activity you will 
be using a triple beam balance to measure mass and 
estimate the masses of everyday objects.
Materials:
Balance capable of measuring 300 grams +/- 0.1 grams
Assorted items such as coins, paperclips, rubber bands, 
washers, marbles, popcorn kernels, etc. 
What you will do
1. Make sure your balance is calibrated properly and shows 
a reading of zero when it is empty. Make adjustments to 
the thumb screw if necessary.
2. Copy the table shown to the right.
3. Choose an object from your assortment that you believe 
has a mass close to one gram. Record the name of the 
object in the first row of the table. 
4. Use the balance to measure the mass of the object to the 
nearest tenth of a gram. Record the mass in the table in 
the first try column. 
5. Unless your mass was exactly one gram, make a second 
attempt to find one or more objects with a mass of one 
gram. Record the object(s) you selected, measure the 
mass, and record the mass.
6. Repeat with all the other masses in the table.
Applying your knowledge
a. Did the accuracy of your estimations increase as the 
activity went on?
b. Calculate your error in estimating the mass of the 10 
gram object on your first try. Calculate your error in 
estimating on your second try.
c. Estimate the mass of the following objects in grams:
•your textbook
•an unsharpened pencil
•a sheet of notebook paper
•a compact disc
d. Estimate your mass in grams and in kilograms.
e. If you wanted to estimate the mass of a car, would you 
use grams or kilograms?

Key Concepts in Physical 
Science
What would you answer if someone asked you “what is 
everything?” In science “everything” means all the matter and 
energy in the universe. Matter and energy are key concepts in 
physical science because they make up the natural world. 
Einstein’s famous equation E = mc2 is often used to represent 
science in cartoons, movies, and popular culture. The “E” in the 
equation stands for energy, and the “m” in the equation 
represents matter. Einstein used this equation to relate energy 
and matter.
Almost all the matter you can touch, taste, or feel is made of 
incredibly tiny particles called atoms. An atom is so small that if 
one atom were the size of a marble, you would be about the size 
of the entire planet Earth! In this chapter, you will learn about 
atoms, matter and energy – some of the most important ideas in 
science! 
1. What is matter made of?
2. What is energy and where does it come from?
3. Are temperature and heat the same thing or are
they different?

UNIT 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Figure 3.1: A car contains more 
matter than a bicycle, therefore it has 
more mass.
kilogram (kg) - the basic metric 
(SI) unit of mass.
gram (g) - a unit of mass smaller 
than a kilogram. One kg equals 
1,000 g.
Where did the unit of kilograms 
come from? Research the origin of 
the metric system to discover how 
the kilogram was first defined and 
what other units of mass it 
replaced.
3.1 Mass and the Atomic Theory of Matter
Mass describes the amount of matter in an object. A car has more mass than a bicycle 
because the car contains more matter (Figure 3.1). Steel, plastic, and rubber are 
different kinds of matter and a car has a lot more of each kind than a bicycle. Ordinary 
matter is made of small particles called atoms. Atoms are so small they cannot be seen 
even with a powerful microscope. To imagine how atoms could be real and yet unseen, 
look at a sugar cube. Held in your hand, a sugar cube looks like a single piece of matter. 
But up close, you can tell it is made up of tiny, individual crystals of sugar fused 
together. Matter is made up of atoms in a similar way.
Grams and kilograms
Kilograms
Mass is measured in kilograms (kg). Most of the world uses kilograms 
for daily measurement, such as buying food (the U.S. is an exception). 
A bunch of bananas or a 1-liter bottle of soda each have a mass of 
about 1 kilogram. People have a mass of around 55 kilograms. 
Common machines range in mass from a bicycle (about 12 kg) to a 
motorcycle (about 200 kg) or car (1,000 - 2,000 kg). You should try to 
develop an intuitive sense for how much mass there is in one 
kilogram since this is a basic quantity in science.
Grams
For small amounts of mass, the kilogram is too large a unit to be 
convenient. One gram (g) is one-thousandth of a kilogram. One grain 
of rice has a mass of about a gram, so a bag of 1,000 grains of rice has 
a mass of approximately 1 kilogram.

51
3.1 MASS AND THE ATOMIC THEORY OF MATTER
CHAPTER 3: KEY CONCEPTS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
Measuring mass in the laboratory
Using a mass
balance
In the laboratory you will usually measure mass with a balance.  The 
balance displays mass in grams. For example, the balance in 
Figure 3.2 shows the mass of six steel nuts to be 96.2 grams. A single 
gram is a tiny mass and balances are therefore sensitive (and quite 
delicate). Never drop things onto a balance! Instead, set things gently 
on the balance.
Converting
grams to
kilograms
For many calculations you will need to convert masses from grams to 
kilograms. To convert a mass in grams to kilograms, you need to 
divide by 1,000 since there are 1,000 grams in a kilogram (g/kg).
Masses you will
consider in
science
Ordinary objects tend to have masses between a few grams and a few 
hundred kilograms. You will encounter a much wider range of masses 
in science. A bacteria has a mass of 0.000000001 kg. That seems small 
— but then an atom has a mass a thousand billion times smaller. 
Science also concerns large masses, such as planets and stars. A star 
like our sun has a mass of 2 million trillion trillion kilograms.
Converting 
mass units
A laboratory balance shows the mass of a banana is 175.5 grams. How much is 
this in kilograms?
1. Looking for:
You are asked for the mass in kilograms.
2. Given:
You are given the mass in grams.
3. Relationships:
There are 1,000 grams in one kilogram.
4. Solution:
175.5 ÷ 1,000 = 0.1755 kg
Your turn...
a. A sack of onions has a mass of 5 kilograms. Can this sack be measured using 
a balance that reads up to 500 grams? Answer: No; 5 kg = 5,000 g
b. Convert 1.77 kilograms to grams. Answer: 1,770 g

in grams. You may need to convert 
grams to kilograms when doing 
calculations.

Figure 3.3: Even a thin sheet of 
aluminum foil is 200,000 atoms thick. 
NOTE: In the illustration, the atoms are 
drawn much larger than they are in 
reality. You could never see an atom 
with a magnifying glass.
atom - the smallest particle of 
matter that retains the identity of its 
element, such as an atom of gold.
element - a pure substance that 
cannot be broken down into other 
elements.
Atoms
The smallest
piece of matter
Suppose you wanted to make the smallest possible piece of gold. You 
cut a pure gold coin into smaller and smaller pieces until you can’t 
cut it any smaller. That smallest possible piece is one atom. A single 
atom is the smallest amount of gold (or any element) you can have.
Atoms
We know ordinary matter is made up of atoms. Atoms make up 
everything that we see, hear, feel, smell, and touch. We cannot  
experience atoms directly because they are so small. Aluminum foil is 
thin but is still more than 200,000 atoms thick (Figure 3.3).
Elements
An element is a pure substance (like gold) that cannot be broken 
down into other elements. All of the matter you are ever likely to 
experience is made from one or more of 92 naturally-occuring 
elements. Each of those 92 elements has a unique type of atom. All 
atoms of a given element are similar to each other. If you could 
examine a million atoms of carbon, you would find them all to be 
similar. But carbon atoms are different from sodium, aluminum, or 
oxygen atoms. The atoms of an element are similar to atoms of the 
same element but different from atoms of other elements.

3.1 MASS AND THE ATOMIC THEORY OF MATTER
CHAPTER 3: KEY CONCEPTS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
How atoms and elements explain chemical changes
Compounds
The properties of matter depend mostly on how atoms of different 
elements are combined in compounds.  A compound is a substance 
that is made up of more than one element. Pure elements are rare. 
Most matter exists in the form of compounds. 
Properties
depend more on
compounds than
on elements
The properties of a compound are usually different from the properties 
of the pure elements that make up the compound. For example, salt is 
a compound of the elements sodium and chlorine (Figure 3.4). The 
properties of salt are quite different from the properties of sodium or 
chlorine. The pure element sodium is a soft, silvery metal. Pure 
chlorine is a yellow-green, toxic gas. Yet the compound of the two (salt) 
is a hard white crystal used to flavor food!
Matter can
change its
properties
One kind of matter can change into 
another kind of matter that has different 
properties than the original matter. For 
example, if you leave an iron nail out in 
the rain, the silver-colored surface soon 
turns brown with rust. Scaly, brown rust 
is so different from hard, silvery steel. 
How does one turn into the other?
Chemical
changes can
rearrange atoms
Rust forms through a chemical change between iron in the nail and 
oxygen in the air. Chemical changes rearrange atoms into different 
molecules and compounds. Remember, the properties of matter 
depend on the arrangement of atoms in a compound. The iron atoms 
in the nail combine with oxygen atoms from the air and water to make 
rust. Rearranging atoms into new compounds is how one kind of 
matter changes into another kind with different properties.
Figure 3.4: Table salt is a compound 
made of sodium and chlorine atoms.

UNIT 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Figure 3.5: Atoms in a solid, a 
liquid, and a gas.
How atoms explain solids, liquids, and gases
Atoms in a solid
The concept of atoms explains how the same substance can be a solid, 
a liquid, or even a gas. In a gold ring, every atom of gold is attached to 
its neighboring atoms and cannot easily move (Figure 3.5). At room 
temperature, gold is solid because the individual atoms are bound 
firmly to each other. They still wiggle around, but do not have enough 
energy to break away from their neighbors.
Atoms in a liquid
A liquid holds its volume, but not its shape — it flows. Liquids flow 
because the atoms can move around. If you heat gold with a torch, it 
finally melts and becomes liquid when the temperature reaches 
1,064°C (1,947°F). The atoms in a liquid have enough energy to 
temporarily break their attachments to their neighbors. The atoms 
are about as close together as they are in a solid, but they continually 
change neighbors, like changing partners in a fast dance. 
Atoms in a gas
A gas flows like a liquid, but can also expand or contract to fill a 
container. A gas can expand or contract because the atoms are 
completely “unbonded” from each other and are relatively far away 
from each other. If you kept heating the molten gold up to 2,856 °C 
(5,173°F), it would finally boil and turn into gold gas. Like other 
gases, gold gas expands to fill any container because the atoms are 
free to move around. Atoms in a gas are much farther apart than 
atoms in a liquid or solid.
Temperature
Atoms are never still. Atoms are always moving, vibrating around 
like drops of water on a hot griddle. You can tell from a substance’s 
temperature the amount of energy of motion each atom has. When 
the temperature is low, each atom has very little energy of motion. 
That is why solids form at low temperatures. When the temperature 
is high, each atom has a lot of energy of motion. Gases form at high 
temperatures because the atoms have enough energy to fly away 
from each other instead of sticking together.

Figure 3.6: The four objects for 
question 3.
In the metric system, you can 
convert from one unit to another    
by shifting the decimal point.           
For example:
0.056 kg = 56 grams
2.55 kg = 2,550 grams
125 grams = 0.125 kg
8 grams = 0.008 kg
Moving the decimal point to the left 
three digits is the same as dividing 
by 1,000. Moving the decimal point  
to the right three digits is the same 
as multiplying by 1,000.

system - a small group of related 
things that work together.
energy - a quantity that measures 
the ability to cause change in the 
physical system. Energy is 
measured in joules.
3.2 Temperature and Energy
If you look around, you are reminded that nothing stays the same for long. Things are 
always changing. Motion, chemical reactions, and a cup of coffee cooling down are all 
examples of change. Why do these changes occur? How do the changes occur? This 
section is about how things change through the exchange of energy. The flow of energy 
connects matter, time, and space and causes things to change.
Two important concepts: systems and energy
What is a
system?
To learn science, we have to break up the complex universe into 
pieces small enough to understand. We call these pieces systems. In 
science, the word “system” means a small group of related things that 
work together. For example, your eye is a system that contains many 
parts, including a lens, pupil, and retina (Figure 3.7).
We learn science
one system
at a time
There are big, complex systems like the solar system. Gravity ties the 
sun and planets together so that they all interact with one another. 
There are also little systems within the big systems, like the weather 
on Earth (which is part of the solar system). Your body is a big, 
complex system. All the organs in your body (like your eye) are 
smaller systems.
The parts of a
system change
by exchanging
energy
The parts of a system interact with each other by exchanging energy. 
Energy is a quantity that measures the ability to cause change. 
Anything with energy can change itself or cause change in other 
objects or systems. Energy can cause changes in temperature, speed, 
position, mass, or other physical variables. Energy can cause change 
in materials, such as burning wood changing into smoke and ashes.
• A gust of wind has energy because it can move objects in its path.
• A piece of wood in a fireplace has energy because it can change
into smoke and ashes, releasing heat and light.
• You have energy because you can change the motion of your own
body.

fundamental quantity in physical science. In the metric system, force 
is measured in newtons (N). A newton is a small unit of force. To lift 
the average person takes a force of 500 to 1,000 newtons.
Energy is
measured in
joules
The unit of energy is related to the units for force and distance. One 
joule (J) of energy is enough to push with a force of one newton for a 
distance of one meter. So a joule is about as much energy as it takes to 
pull a small book across a table. If you have more energy, you can pull 
with more force or for a greater distance — or both. 
Forces can
transfer energy
from one object
to another
Energy often moves through the action of forces. In fact, one 
important property of energy is the stored ability to create force. An 
object which has energy may exert forces to transfer its energy to 
another object. If an object has absolutely zero energy, then no forces 
may be produced. Another way to think about force is as an action that 
may transfer energy from one object to another.
Potential energy
Objects may have energy due to their height. For example, a book high 
on a shelf has more energy than a book on the floor (Figure 3.8). This 
kind of energy is called potential energy and comes from Earth’s 
gravity.
Kinetic energy
Objects in motion have energy due to their speed. Energy of motion is 
called kinetic energy. The faster an object is moving, the more kinetic 
energy it has. If an object has kinetic energy, it may transfer that 
energy to other objects by applying forces. For example, if you catch a 
falling book, the book exerts a force against your hand. The energy of 
motion of the book is transferred to your hand through that force.

energy) and energy of height (potential 
energy).

Temperature
Hot and cold
You have seen a thermometer hung outside someplace to register the 
temperature. Temperature is the measurement we use to make the 
sensations of hot and cold more precise. Experience has taught you to  
wear a coat if the weather forecast predicts a high of 40°F, and to 
wear shorts if a high of 95°F is predicted. But what is different about 
the air that makes it feel 95 degrees rather than 40?
Thermometers
A thermometer is an instrument used to accurately 
measure temperature. The common alcohol thermometer 
uses the expansion of colored liquid alcohol to show 
temperature. As the temperature increases, the alcohol 
expands and rises up a long, thin tube. You read the 
temperature by looking at the mark the alcohol reaches.
 Fahrenheit
scale
You are probably most familiar with the English system 
of measuring temperature, known as the Fahrenheit 
scale. It was developed in 1714 by Gabriel Fahrenheit, a 
German physicist who was the first person to use a 
mercury thermometer. He chose the lowest temperature 
he could create in his lab (using water, salt, and ice) to be 
the zero point of his scale. For the other end of the scale he used the 
temperature of the human body as 100 degrees. Eventually the 
Fahrenheit scale was standardized so that the freezing point of water 
is 32 degrees and the boiling point is 212 degrees. 
 Celsius
scale
In 1742, Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, invented a 
temperature scale in which there were 100 degrees between freezing 
and boiling. He called it the centigrade scale. In 1948 this official 
scale of the metric system was named the Celsius scale in his honor. 
Most countries use the Celsius scale. Figure 3.9 shows how the two 
temperature scales compare.

A weather report forecasting 21°C in Barcelona, Spain, predicts a 
pleasant day, suitable for shorts and a T-shirt. A weather report 
predicting 21°F in Minneapolis, Minnesota, suggests wearing a heavy 
winter coat, gloves, and a hat. Because the United States is one of the 
few countries that still use the Fahrenheit scale, it is useful to know 
how to convert between the two temperature scales.

You are asked for the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Given:
You are given the temperature in degrees Celsius.
3. Relationships:
Use the conversion formula: TF = 9/5TC + 32.
4. Solution:
TF = (9/5)(200) + 32 = 392 °F.
Your turn...
a. You are planning a trip to Iceland this summer. You find out that the average July temperature in Iceland is 11.2°C. What is 
the average July temperature in degrees Fahrenheit? Answer: 52.2°F
b. You are doing a science experiment with a Fahrenheit thermometer. Your data must be in degrees Celsius. If you measure a 
temperature of 125°F, what is this temperature in degrees Celsius? Answer: 51.7°C 
Using the proper units
Temperatures in Fahrenheit and 
Celsius are easy to confuse. 
Science usually works in Celsius, 
as do most countries. However, 
the United States uses Fahrenheit 
for everyday communication. Get 
in the habit of writing the units 
whenever you write down a 
number in science. For example, 
write 10°C instead of just 10 or 
25.5 grams instead of just 25.5. 
This will keep you from getting 
confused later on.

Figure 3.10:  Some extremes of 
temperature on Earth.
absolute zero - the lowest 
temperature there can be, equal to 
-273.3°C or -460°F.
Can you think of a reason the 
temperature cannot go lower than 
absolute zero? Hint: Think about 
the energy of molecules as they 
get colder and colder.
Temperature extremes
Absolute zero
There is a limit to how cold matter can get. Absolute zero is -273°C 
(-459°F). You cannot have a temperature lower than absolute zero. As 
temperature is reduced, all atoms move more and more slowly. 
At -273°C atoms have the lowest energy they can have and the 
temperature cannot get any lower. Think of absolute zero as the 
temperature at which atoms are “frozen.” Technically, molecules 
never completely stop moving, but at absolute zero their energy is so 
small they might as well be stopped.
High
temperatures
Unlike with absolute zero, there is no maximum temperature for 
matter. As temperature increases, exotic forms of matter appear. For 
example, at 10,000°C atoms start to come apart and become a 
plasma. In a plasma, the atoms are broken apart into separate 
positive ions and negative electrons. Plasma conducts electricity and 
is formed in lightning and inside stars.
Temperatures in
the Solar System
When compared with temperatures in other parts of the universe, 
temperatures on Earth fall in a small range (Figure 3.10). In the 
solar system, temperatures can range from a low of approximately      
-270°C (-454ºF) between the outer planets to a high of 
15 million °C at the center of the sun. 
Temperatures on
Earth
The coldest place on Earth is Antarctica. The lowest temperature 
ever recorded there was -89°C (-129°F) in 1983. The hottest 
temperature recorded on Earth was in Libya, in North Africa, in 1922 
when it was 58°C (136ºF). The hottest temperature recorded in 
California is in Death Valley where it reached 57°C (135°F). Much 
colder and hotter temperatures have been produced in laboratories. 
Scientists have experimented with temperatures as low as billionths 
of a degree above absolute zero and as high as 100 million million 
degrees Celsius.

61
3.2 TEMPERATURE AND ENERGY
CHAPTER 3: KEY CONCEPTS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
Heat and thermal energy
Temperature
measures
thermal energy
Temperature measures a kind of energy called thermal energy. The 
higher the temperature, the more thermal energy is present. A hot 
object has more thermal energy than the same object when it is cold. 
On the molecular level, thermal energy comes from the motion of 
atoms in matter. When matter is hot, atoms are vigorously moving  
with lots of kinetic energy. When objects are cold, the atoms move 
slower and have less kinetic energy. Fundamentally, thermal energy 
is the total energy stored in the kinetic energy of individual atoms.
Heat is moving
thermal energy
When you put something hot in a cold room, the temperature of the 
hot object decreases. The temperature of the cold air in the room 
increases. This is because thermal energy flows from hot to cold, or 
from higher temperature to lower temperature. We call thermal 
energy that is flowing heat. Heat flows from hot to cold whenever two 
quantities of matter at different temperatures are allowed to interact 
with each other (Figure 3.11).
Calories
Thermal energy is often measured in calories. One calorie is the 
amount of energy it takes to raise the temperature of one milliliter of 
water by one degree Celsius. The calorie is a slightly larger unit of 
energy than the joule. One calorie is 4.184 joules. There are two 
different units because scientists started measuring heat in calories 
before they knew heat was a form of energy.
Food energy is
measured in
kilocalories
Joules and calories are tiny amounts of energy compared with the 
energy used around you every day. Because the joule is so small, the 
energy in foods is measured in kilocalories, also called food calories, or 
just Calories with a capital “C.” One Calorie (kilocalorie) is equal to 
4,184 joules. The energy in a single jelly doughnut (200 Calories) is an 
astounding 837,000 joules. 
Figure 3.11: Heat is the flow of 
thermal energy from higher temperature 
to lower temperature.
thermal energy - energy that is 
due to difference in temperature.  
Thermal energy comes from 
kinetic energy of individual atoms.

Specific heat
Temperature and
mass
If you add heat to an object, how much will its temperature increase? 
It depends in part on the mass of the object. If you double the mass of 
the object you are going to heat, you need twice as much energy to 
increase the temperature.
Temperature and
type of material
The amount of temperature increase also depends on the kind of 
material you are heating. It takes different amounts of energy to 
raise the temperature of different materials. You need to add 4,184 
joules of heat to 1 kilogram of water to raise the temperature by 1°C.  
(Figure 3.12). You only need to add 470 joules of heat to raise the 
temperature of a kilogram of steel by 1°C. It takes nine times more 
energy to raise the temperature of water by 1 degree than it does to 
raise the temperature of the same mass of steel by 1 degree.
Specific heat
The specific heat is a property of a substance that tells us how much 
heat is needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a material 
by one degree Celsius. A large specific heat means you have to put in 
a lot of energy for each degree increase in temperature. Specific heat 
is measured in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (joule/kg°C).
The specific heat is the energy that will raise 
the temperature of one kilogram by 1°C.
Uses for
specific heat
Knowing the specific heat tells you how quickly the temperature of a 
material will change as it gains or loses energy. If the specific heat is 
low (like it is for steel), then temperature will change relatively 
quickly because each degree of change takes less energy. If the 
specific heat is high (like it is for water), then temperature will 
change relatively slowly because each degree of change takes more 
energy. Next time you have some for dessert, remember that your 
apple pie filling will stay hot for a long time because it is mostly 
water and water has a high specific heat.

3.2 TEMPERATURE AND ENERGY
CHAPTER 3: KEY CONCEPTS IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE
 Conservation of energy
Law of
conservation of
energy
One of the most important of all the natural laws concerns energy. 
The law of conservation of energy says that energy can never be 
created or destroyed, just converted from one form into another. The 
law of conservation of energy applies to all forms of energy, including 
potential energy, kinetic energy, and chemical energy. 
Energy can never be created or destroyed,  
just converted from one form into another.
Energy
transformations
Although it cannot be destroyed, energy can be transformed easily 
between its different forms. The diagram in Figure 3.14 shows the 
energy transformations that produce the electrical energy you use.
Energy from
water and  wind
Many parts of California get energy from water and wind. In 
hydroelectric power, energy is released by falling water. The potential 
energy of the water is converted into electrical energy. In wind power, 
the kinetic energy in moving air is converted into electrical energy.
Chemical energy
Chemical energy is energy that 
is stored in the bonding forces 
between atoms. Chemical 
reactions may use or release 
chemical energy. A car engine 
converts about 13 percent of the 
chemical energy in gasoline into 
kinetic energy of the moving 
car. Much of the remaining      
87 percent of the energy in the 
gasoline becomes heat in the 
exhaust gases and radiator.
Figure 3.14: .The electricity in your 
wall outlets at home carries energy that 
has been transformed several times 
before becoming electrical energy.

UNIT 1: PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Please turn out the lights when 
you leave!
There are about 285,000,000 
people living in the United States. 
If an average house has four light 
bulbs per person, it adds up to 
1,140,000,000 light bulbs. The 
average bulb uses 100 joules of 
electrical energy each second. 
Multiplying it out gives an estimate 
of 114,000,000,000 joules every 
second — just for light bulbs. 
A big electric power plant puts out 
2 billion joules each second. That 
means 67 big power plants are 
burning up resources just to run 
your light bulbs. If everyone were 
to switch their incandescent bulbs 
to fluorescent lights, we would 
save 75 percent of this electricity. 
That means we could save 50 big 
power plants’ worth of pollution 
and wasted resources.
‘Using’ and ‘conserving’ energy in the everyday sense
Conserving
energy
We have all heard that it’s good to “conserve energy” and not waste it. 
This is good advice because energy from gasoline and electricity costs 
money and uses resources. But what does it mean to “use energy” in 
the everyday sense? If energy can never be created or destroyed, how 
can it be “used up”? Why worry about “running out” of energy?
Using energy
When you “use” energy by turning on a light you are converting 
energy from one form (electricity) to other forms (light and heat). 
What gets “used up” is the amount of energy in the form of electricity. 
Electricity is a valuable form of energy because it is easy to move long 
distances (through wires). So the energy is not truly “used up” but is 
just converted into other forms. The total amount of energy stays 
constant.
Power plants
Electric power plants do not make electrical energy. Energy cannot be 
created. What power plants do is convert other forms of energy 
(chemical, solar, nuclear) into usable electrical energy. When 
someone advises you to turn out the lights to conserve energy, they 
are asking you to use less electrical energy. If people used less 
electrical energy, power plants would have to burn less oil, gas, or 
other fuels to “produce” the electrical energy.
Running out of
energy
Many people are concerned about “running out” of energy. What they 
mean is running out of certain forms of energy that are easy to use, 
such as oil and gas. When you use gasoline in a car, the chemical 
energy in the gas mostly becomes heat energy. It is impractical to put 
the heat energy back into the form of gasoline, so we say the energy 
has been “used up” even though the energy itself is still there, only in 
a different form. Earth contains a limited amount of oil and gas. 
When what we have is gone — that is, converted from gas and oil into 
other forms — there will be no more. There will still be plenty of 
energy, just not in the form of oil or gas. Those two are valuable 
because much of our economy has been developed around using the 
energy contained in them.

A Mighty Energizing Wind 
There is a new kind of farm that is unlike any other - it reaps 
the wind. These farms can help solve the energy crisis by 
generating electricity from the powerful forces in wind.
Not that long ago, most farms in the United States had a 
windmill. It was used to pump water from a well to supply 
the farm’s needs. These days an electric motor pumps the 
water, and the old windmill is gone or just an antique.
New windmills, however, are going strong. Tower-mounted 
wind turbines that are far larger and more efficient have 
replaced the old models. When these big turbines are 
grouped, they form a wind farm. They are being built on land 
that is still used for farming. With support from industry 
and the government, wind farms are sprouting across the 
country. Researchers are finding ways to improve windmill 
efficiency and solve the issue of low wind speed.
A wind turbine is almost the opposite of a fan. A fan uses 
electricity to make wind; the turbine uses wind to make 
electricity. The operation is quite simple: Wind turns the 
turbine’s blades, which spins a shaft that connects to a 
generator, which produces electricity. The old farm 
windmills had several blades on a small metal or even 
wooden tower. Today’s wind turbines have two or three 
blades mounted on towers that may be hundreds of feet tall.  
The promise of wind’s power
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, wind power 
costs 4 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Coal-fired power costs 
4.8 to 5.5 cents, and natural gas can cost as little as 4 cents, 
so wind power is competitive. And it has notable advantages. 
• A clean fuel source that does not pollute the air like coal-
or gas-burning power plants. 
• Does not need to be imported.
• Abundant resource - it will never run out. 
• Requires no mining or drilling. 
• One of the lowest-priced renewable energy technologies
available. 
Wind power can also benefit the economies of rural areas. 
The power companies pay rent to landowners. Since the 
turbines occupy only a fraction of the land on a wind farm, 
the landowner can farm around the towers.

UNIT 1  PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND YOU
Obstacles, naturally
The biggest problem with wind power is obvious: Wind is 
intermittent. It cannot be counted on to blow when 
electricity is needed. It does not blow at a steady rate. 
Another problem is that electricity from wind cannot be 
stored, except in batteries.
Also, the best sites for wind farms are often in remote 
locations, in mountains or deserts, far from cities where the 
most electricity is needed. The map of the United States 
shows wind energy potential. Find your state to see how 
windy it is compared with other states.
According to the Department of Energy, 6 percent of the 
nation’s land mass has wind energy resources. This area has 
the potential to supply more than one and half times the 
electricity being consumed today. Yet obstacles stand in the 
way of harvesting this natural resource. 
• Wind farms are not always welcome in communities, for a
variety of reasons.
• As the turbines spin, rotor blades produce a certain
amount of noise. 
• Some people dislike the industrial look of the wind-farm
towers. 
• Concern for the fact that some birds and bats are killed
when they fly into the rotors.
Searching for solutions
There needs to be more research and better methods of 
harvesting in areas with less wind speed. Wind industry 
scientists and engineers, in partnership with the 
Department of Energy, are designing, analyzing, and testing 
equipment and methods in order to improve performance. 
Progress in research requires test after test. Before a new 
product such as an improved wind turbine is placed on the 
market, a single model is made and tested repeatedly. 
Not all wind farms are on land. Offshore wind energy 
projects such as the Nantucket Sound wind farm are being 
looked at more closely. Research is underway on floating 
turbines to be tested in US coastal waters and the lower 
Great Lakes. Such sites would be one way to solve the 
drawback of distance from large cities that need electricity.
Questions: 
1. How does a wind turbine operate? 
2. Compare and contrast wind energy with fossil fuel. 
3. What are the disadvantages to wind power? 
4. Why is it important to research and study wind energy?

Your Own Science Experiment
The scientific method sets science apart from other types of 
study. The method begins with observation of some 
phenomenon. After making observations, scientists propose 
a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an informed guess about the 
outcome of the experiment. The hypothesis is then tested to 
find out whether or not it is true. During this activity, you 
will be designing and conducting your own experiment.

String, assorted sizes of balls, newspaper, meter stick, 
stopwatch, balance, paper cups, macaroni, rubber bands, 
paper clips

1. Brainstorm with your group to decide on an experiment 
you could make up and carry out with the above 
materials. Working together, brainstorm what questions 
your group would like to find answers to.
2. Once you decide on an experiment you would like to 
design, identify the independent variable, dependent 
variable, and control variables. Think about how 
changing the different variables or keeping them 
constant might affect your experiment.
3. Write a procedure for your experiment. List which of the 
materials you are using. Think about what types of 
measurements and observations you need to make. Could 
any of the materials could be used for making 
measurements?
4. Make an educated guess, using your experience and 
knowledge, as to what you predict will happen in this 
experiment. Think about the relationship between the 
independent and dependent variables. Your educated 
guess is your hypothesis.
5. Carry out your experiment. Take your measurements and 
make your observations. Record all your data.
6. Analyze your data to determine whether your hypothesis 
was correct. This may involve making a graph or other

Can you make an egg float? Place an egg in a glass
that is half full of fresh water. The egg will sink
because it is denser than the water. Now mix about 8
to 10 teaspoons of salt into the fresh water.
Place the egg in the saltwater mixture. Can you explain
the result? Can you figure out how to make the egg
sink halfway into a glass of water and then stop before
hitting the bottom?

Chapter 4
Density and Buoyancy
Will it float or will it sink? If you are designing ships this is a 
very important question. The largest ship in the world is the 
Jahre Viking, an oil-carrying tanker. This super-sized ship is 
1,504 feet long and 264 feet wide, longer than 5 football fields 
laid end-to-end. If the Empire State building was laid on its side, 
the Jahre Viking would be longer by 253 feet! Crew members use 
bicycles to get from place to place on the ship. The ship is too 
large to fit through the Panama or Suez Canal, and it cannot 
dock in many of the world’s seaports. The Jahre Viking is largely 
constructed of steel – so how can a big, heavy ship like this 
actually float? By the time you finish studying this chapter on 
density and buoyancy, you will be able to explain how ships and 
boats of all shapes and sizes can float.
1. What is density and how can you measure it?
2. What two things does density depend on?
3. How does a steel ship float, when a steel marble
sinks?

4.1 Density
When you think about the many kinds of matter you come into contact with every day, 
what properties come to mind? Some matter is solid and hard, like steel and wood. Some 
matter is liquid like water, or a gas like air. And in the category of solid matter, there 
are big differences. A block of wood and a block of steel may be the same size but one has 
a lot more mass than the other. Because of that difference in mass, wood floats in water 
and steel sinks. Whether an object floats or sinks in water is related to its density. This 
chapter will explain density, a property of all matter.
Density is a property of matter
Density is mass
per unit volume
Density describes how much mass is in a given volume of a material. 
Steel has high density; it contains 7.8 grams of mass per cubic 
centimeter. Aluminum, as you well might predict, has a lower 
density; a one-centimeter cube has a mass of only 2.7 grams.
The density of
water and air
Liquids and gases are matter and have density. The density of water 
is about one gram per cubic centimeter. The density of air is lower, of 
course — much lower. The air in your classroom has a density of 
about 0.001 grams per cubic centimeter.

CHAPTER 4: DENSITY AND BUOYANCY
Units of density
Density in units
of grams per
milliliter
Your laboratory investigations will typically use density in units of 
grams per milliliter (g/mL). The density of water is one gram per 
milliliter. That means one milliliter of water has a mass of one gram, 
and 100 milliliters of water a mass of 100 grams.
Density in g/cm3
and kg/m3
Some problems use density in units of grams per cubic centimeter     
(g/cm3). Since one milliliter is exactly the same volume as one cubic 
centimeter, the units of g/cm3 and g/mL are actually the same. For 
applications using large objects, it is more convenient to use density in 
units of kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3). Table 4.1 gives the 
densities of some common substances in both units.
Converting units
of density
To convert from one to the other, remember that 1 g/cm3 is equal to 
1000 kg/m3. To go from g/cm3 to kg/m3 you multiply by 1,000. For 
example, the density of ice is 0.92 g/cm3. This is the same as 
920 kg/m3. 
To go from kg/m3 to g/cm3 you divide by 1,000. For example, the 
density of aluminum is 2,700 kg/m3. Dividing by 1,000 gives a density 
of 2.7 g/cm3.
Convert 
between units 
of density
A reference book lists the density of ceramic tile as 2,650 kg/m3. Estimate the 
mass of one cubic centimeter of tile.
1. Looking for:
Mass of 1 cm3, which is the density in g/cm3
2. Given:
Density of 2,650 kg/m3
3. Relationships:
1 g/cm3 = 1,000 kg/m3
4. Solution:
Divide by 1,000 to get the density in g/cm3. 
2,650 ÷ 1,000 = 2.65 g
Your turn...
a. A bronze statue has a density of 6,000 kg/m3. What is the density in g/mL?

Solving problems
A four-step
technique
The method for solving problems has four steps. Follow these steps 
and you will be able to see a way to the answer most of the time and 
will at least make progress toward the answer almost every time. 
There is often more than one way to solve a problem. Sometimes you 
will have to use creativity to work with the given information to find 
the answer. Figure 4.4 shows the steps for solving problems.
Solved example

Throughout this book you will find example problems that have been 
solved for you. Following each solved example, there are often 
practice problems. The answers to the practice problems are provided 
so that you can check your work while practicing your problem-
solving skills. Always remember to write out the steps when you are 
solving problems on your own. If you make a mistake, you will be able 
to look at your work and figure out where you went wrong. Here is 
the format for example problems:

Problem solving is important in all careers. For example, financial 
analysts are expected to look at information about businesses and 
figure out which companies are succeeding. Doctors collect 
information about patients and must figure out what is causing pain 
or an illness. Mechanics gather information about a car and have to 
figure out how to fix the engine. All these examples use problem-
solving skills.

What is the density of the candle? 
1. Looking for:
You are asked for the density. 
2. Given:
You are given the mass and volume.
3. Relationships:
Density is mass divided by volume:
4. Solution:
density = (1,400 g) ÷ (1,000 ml) = 1.4 g/ml

4.1 DENSITY
CHAPTER 4: DENSITY AND BUOYANCY
Density of common materials
Material density
is independent
of shape
Density is a property of material independent of quantity or shape. 
For example, a steel nail and a steel cube have different amounts of 
matter and therefore different masses (Figure 4.5). They also have 
different volumes. However, if you calculate density by dividing mass 
by volume, the result is the same for both the nail and the cube. 
Strong solids
typically have
higher density
Solids that are strong, such as steel, typically have high density. High 
density means there are many atoms per cubic centimeter. Many 
atoms in a material means many bonds between atoms, and those 
bonds are what ultimately create strength. There are exceptions, 
however. Lead is very dense but not very strong because the bonds 
between lead atoms are relatively weak.
Soft materials
typically have
lower density
Solids with low density, such as cork or foam, are often used as 
cushioning material. Low density means there are relatively large 
spaces between atoms. That means materials may be compressed 
relatively easily, which is why foam and other low-density substances 
make good packing materials.
Liquids tend to
be less dense
than solids of
the same
material
The density of a liquid is usually close to 
solid density, surprisingly enough, but 
less. For example, the density of solder is 
10 g/ml. The density of liquid solder is 9.5 
g/ml. The liquid density is lower because 
the atoms are not packed as uniformly as 
they are in the solid. Picture a brand-new 
box of toy blocks. When you open the box, 
you see the blocks tightly packed in a 
repeating pattern, like the atoms in a 
solid. Now imagine dumping the blocks 
out of the box, and then trying to pour 
them back into the original tight packing 
pattern. The jumbled blocks take up more space, like the atoms in a 
liquid. Water is an exception to this rule. The density of solid water, or 
ice, is less than the density of liquid water.
Figure 4.5: The density of a steel nail 
is the same as the density of a solid cube 
of steel.
Figure 4.6: The same number (or 
mass) of blocks arranged in a tight, 
repeating pattern take up less space 
than when they are jumbled up.

Volume
Volume
Volume is the amount of space an object takes up. The units used to 
measure volume depend on whether the object is solid or liquid. The 
volume of solids is measured in cubic centimeters (cm3) or cubic 
meters (m3). The volume of liquids is measured in milliliters (mL) or 
liters (L). One cubic centimeter is the same volume as one milliliter.
Measuring the
volume of liquids
Measuring the volume of liquids is easy. Pour the liquid into a 
marked container called a graduated cylinder and read the volume. 
There are two things to keep in mind to measure accurately. First, 
read the mark at eye level. Second, you will notice that the surface of 
the liquid forms a curve rather than a straight line (Figure 4.7). This 
curve is called the meniscus. Read the volume at the center of the 
meniscus.
Volume of solids
You have probably already learned to measure the volume of some 
solid shapes. The volume of a rectangular solid (a shoebox shape), for 
example, is found by multiplying length times width times height. 
The volume of a sphere is 4/3πr3, with r equal to the radius of the 
sphere.
The
displacement
method
You can find the volume of an irregular shape using a technique 
called displacement. To displace means to “take the place of” or to 
“push aside.” You can find the volume of an irregularly shaped object 
by putting it in water and measuring the amount of water displaced. 
How you
make the
measurement
You can use the displacement method to find the volume of an 
ordinary item like a house key. Fill a 100-milliliter graduated 
cylinder with 50 mL of water (Figure 4.7). Gently slide the key into 
the water. The water level in the container will rise, because the key 
displaced, or pushed aside, some water. If the level now reads 53.0 
mL, you know that the key displaced 3.0 mL of water. The volume of 
the key, or of any object you measured in this way, is equal to the 
volume of the water it displaced. The key has a volume of 3.0 
milliliters, or 3.0 cubic centimeters (cm3).

4.1 DENSITY
CHAPTER 4: DENSITY AND BUOYANCY
Determining density
Measuring
density
To find the density of a material, you need to know the mass and 
volume of a solid sample of the material. You can calculate the density 
from the formula below.
Mass is measured with a balance or scale. For irregular objects 
(Figure 4.10) the displacement method can be used to find the volume.
Calculating
volume
For simple shapes you can calculate the volume. The volume of 
spheres, cylinders, and rectangular solids is given in the diagram in 
Figure 4.9. When calculating volume, all of the units of length 
involved in the calculation must be the same. For example, if you want 
volume in cubic centimeters, all of the measurements in the 
calculation must be in centimeters.
Calculate 
density from 
mass and 
volume
A student measures the mass of five steel nuts to be 96.2 grams. The nuts 
displace 13 mL of water. Calculate the density of the steel in the nuts.
1. Looking for:
Density
2. Given:
Mass (96.2 g) and volume (13 mL)
3. Relationships:
Density = mass ÷ volume
4. Solution:
D = 96.2g ÷ 13 mL = 7.4 g/mL
Your turn...

Why density varies
Atoms have
different masses
The density of a material depends on two things. First is the 
individual mass of each atom or molecule. Solid lead is denser than 
solid aluminum mostly because a single atom of lead has 7.7 times 
more mass than a single aluminum atom.
Atoms may be
“packed” tightly
or loosely
Second, density depends on how tightly the atoms are packed. A 
diamond is made of carbon atoms and has a density of 3,500 kg/m3. 
The carbon atoms in diamonds are closely packed. Paraffin wax is 
mostly carbon, but the density of paraffin is only 870 kg/m3. The 
density of paraffin is low because the carbon atoms are mixed with 
hydrogen atoms in long molecules that take up a lot of space.
Solving density
problems
Density problems usually ask you to find one of the three variables 
(mass, volume, density), given the other two. Figure 4.12 shows three 
forms of the density equation you can use. Which one you choose 
depends on what you are asked to find.
Using the 
density 
equation
A 4,500-gram cube of titanium is 10 centimeters on each side. Calculate its 
volume in cm3, and then calculate its density in g/cm3.

4.2 Buoyancy
If you drop a steel marble into a glass of water, it sinks to the bottom. The steel does not 
float because it has a greater density than the water. And yet many ships are made of 
steel. How does a steel ship float when a steel marble sinks? The answer has to do with 
gravity and weight. 
Weight and buoyancy
Weight and mass
are not the same
We all tend to use the terms weight and mass interchangeably. In 
science however, weight and mass are not the same thing. Mass is a 
fundamental property of matter. Weight is a force, like any other 
pushing or pulling force, and is caused by Earth’s gravity. It is easy to 
confuse mass and weight because heavy objects (more weight) have 
lots of mass and light objects (less weight) have little mass.
Buoyancy is a
force
It is much easier to lift yourself in a swimming pool than to lift 
yourself on land. That is because the water in the pool exerts an 
upward force on you that acts in a direction opposite to your weight 
(Figure 4.13). We call this force buoyancy. Buoyancy is a measure of 
the upward force a fluid exerts on an object that is submerged. 
Pushing a ball
underwater
The strength of the 
buoyant force on an 
object in water depends 
on the volume of the 
object that is 
underwater. Suppose 
you have a large beach 
ball you want to 
submerge in a pool. As 
you keep pushing downward on the ball, you notice the buoyant force 
getting stronger and stronger. The greater the part of the ball you 
manage to push underwater, the stronger the force trying to push it 
back up. The strength of the buoyant force is proportional to the 
volume of the part of the ball that is submerged.

4.2 BUOYANCY
CHAPTER 4: DENSITY AND BUOYANCY
Archimedes’ principle 
Archimedes’
principle
In the third century BC, a Greek mathematician named Archimedes 
realized that buoyant force is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by 
an object. We call this relationship Archimedes’ principle. For 
example, suppose a rock with a volume of 1,000 cubic centimeters is 
dropped into water (Figure 4.14). The rock displaces 1,000 cm3 of 
water, which has a mass of 1 kilogram. The buoyant force on the rock 
is the weight of 1 kilogram of water, which is 9.8 newtons.   
A simple
buoyancy
experiment
A simple experiment can be done to measure the buoyant force on a 
rock (or any object) with a spring scale. Suppose you have a rock with 
a volume of 1,000 cubic centimeters and a mass of three kilograms. In 
air, the scale shows the rock’s weight as 29.4 newtons. The rock is 
then gradually immersed in water, but not allowed to touch the 
bottom or sides of the container. As the rock enters the water, the 
reading on the scale decreases. When the rock is completely 
submerged, the scale reads 19.6 newtons.
Calculating the
buoyant force
Subtracting the two scale readings, 29.4 newtons and 19.6 newtons, 
results in a difference of 9.8 newtons. This is the buoyant force exerted 
on the rock, and it is the same as the weight of the 1,000 cubic 
centimeters of water the rock displaced.

Comparing
buoyant force
and weight
Buoyancy explains why some objects sink and others float. A 
submerged object floats to the surface if the buoyant force is greater 
than its weight (Figure 4.15). If the buoyant force is less than its 
weight, then the object sinks.
Equilibrium
Suppose you place a block of foam in a tub of water. The block sinks 
partially below the surface. Then it floats without sinking any 
farther. The upward buoyant force perfectly balances the downward 
force of gravity (the block’s weight). But how does the buoyant force 
“know” how strong to be to balance the weight?      
Denser objects
float lower in
the water
You can see the answer to this question in the pictures above. If a 
foam block and a wood block of the same size are both floating, the 
wood block sinks farther into the water. Wood has a greater density, 
so the wood block weighs more. A greater buoyant force is needed to 
balance the wood block’s weight, so the wood block displaces more 
water. The foam block has to sink only slightly to displace water with 
a weight equal to the block’s weight. A floating object displaces just 
enough water to make the buoyant force equal to the object’s weight.

4.2 BUOYANCY
CHAPTER 4: DENSITY AND BUOYANCY
Density and buoyancy 
Comparing
densities
If you know an object’s density, you can immediately predict whether 
it will sink or float — without measuring its weight. An object sinks if 
its density is greater than that of the liquid. It floats if its density is 
less than that of the liquid.
Two balls with
the same volume
but different
density
To see why, picture dropping two balls in a pool of water. The balls 
have the same size and volume but have different densities. The steel 
ball has a density of 7.8 g/ml which is greater than the density of 
water (1.0 g/ml). The wood ball has a density of 0.75 g/ml, which is less 
than the density of water.
Why one sinks
and the other
floats
When they are completely underwater, both balls have the same 
buoyant force because they displace the same volume of water. 
However, the steel ball has more weight since it has a higher density. 
The steel ball sinks because steel’s higher density makes the ball 
heavier than the same volume of water. The wood ball floats because 
wood’s lower density makes the wood ball lighter than the same 
volume of displaced water.
An object with an 
average density 
GREATER than the 
density of water will 
sink
An object with an 
average density LESS 
than the density of 
water will float.
Figure 4.16:  The meaning of 
average density.

86
UNIT 2 PROPERTIES OF MATTER
Figure 4.17: A full ship has more 
mass than an empty ship. This means a 
full ship must displace more water (sink 
deeper) to make the buoyant force large 
enough to balance the ship’s weight.
Boats and average density
How do steel
boats float?
If you place a solid chunk of steel in water, it immediately sinks 
because the density of steel (7.8 g/cm3) is much greater than the 
density of water (1.0 g/cm3). So how is it that thousands of huge ships 
made of steel are floating around the world? The answer is that it is 
the average density that determines whether the object sinks or 
floats.
Solid steel sinks
because it is
denser than
water
To make steel float, you have to reduce the average density somehow. 
Making the steel hollow does exactly that. Making a boat hollow 
expands its volume a tremendous amount without changing its mass. 
Steel is so strong that it is quite easy to reduce the average density of 
a boat to 10 percent of the density of water by making the shell of the 
boat relatively thin. 
Increasing
volume
decreases
density
Ah, you say, but that is an empty ship. True, so the density of a new 
ship must be designed to be under 1.0 g/cm3 to allow for cargo. When 
objects are placed in a boat, of course its average density increases. 
The boat must sink deeper to displace more water and increase the 
buoyant force (Figure 4.17). If you have seen a loaded cargo ship, you 
might have noticed that it sat lower in the water than an unloaded 
ship nearby. In fact, the limit to how much a ship can carry is set by 
how low in the water the ship can get before rough seas cause waves 
to break over the side of the sip.

Airships in the Sky
What do televised football, baseball, and auto racing all have in 
common? You might think of sports, dedicated fans, and 
athletes. While these similarities are true, one common feature 
is that blimps provide video coverage for each of these events. 
Large, oval shaped airships hover over 
stadiums providing aerial shots of the 
action. Television cameras attached to the 
blimp’s underside take wide-angle 
pictures. In addition, blimps provide 
advertising for major corporations. You 
have probably seen one in a sports 
telecast. 
Hot air balloons
Anything that flies is an aircraft. In fact, 
the hot air balloon was the first aircraft 
invented, dating back to the early 1700s 
almost 200 years before the Wright 
brothers tested their first successful 
powered airplane. A hot air balloon 
depends on buoyancy forces for lift. Air in 
the balloon is kept hot by a burner. Hot air has a lower density 
than cold air. As long as the air inside the balloon is 
significantly hotter than the air outside, the balloon floats. 
The density of air decreases with altitude. A hot air balloon 
floats upward until its average density matches the average 
density of the surrounding air. To go up father, the balloon pilot 
makes the air hotter inside the balloon, decreasing the average 
density. To go down, the pilot releases some hot air, making the 
balloon smaller and decreasing its average density. 
The problem with hot air balloons is how to steer! With a hot air 
balloon you can only control motion up or down. The only way to 
steer is to change your altitude in hopes that the wind will be 
blowing the way you want to go at some altitude. This is all 
right if you are ballooning for fun. However, the direction of the 
wind is not reliable enough to use hot air balloons for travel or 
for shipping. 
Blimps
A blimp is a type of airship, like a hot air balloon. Like a hot air 
balloon, a blimp also gets its lift from buoyancy of surrounding 
air. However, a blimp is filled with 
helium, a gas that is lighter than 
air. Unlike a balloon, a blimp keeps 
its helium gas at the same 
temperature as the surrounding air.
A blimp has four major parts: the 
envelope, gondola, engines, and 
controls. The envelope is the large 
cavity filled with helium. Made of 
polyester fabric similar to 
spacesuits, the envelope is a cigar-
shaped, aerodynamic design. The 
gondola carries passengers and 
pilots and contains the engines and 
controls. Gasoline powered engines 
move blimps an average of 35 miles 
per hour. 
Because the blimp has a motor, it can steer with a rudder, like a 
boat. Controls allow the pilot to steer the blimp up, down, right, 
or left. This is a big advantage over a hot air balloon.
Henri Giffard invented the first powered airship in 1852. In 
1900, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin invented the first rigid 
airship with a metal structure providing its shape. For 
buoyancy, early blimps used hydrogen. Hydrogen is very light 
bit also very explosive! In fact, the famous Hindenburg blimp, 
filled with hydrogen, exploded and burned during an accident 
in New Jersey in 1937. 
Today, blimps are filled with helium instead of hydrogen, and 
do not have a rigid steel structure. Instead, modern blimps are 
nothing more than a large, strong, gas balloons. The 
aerodynamic shape is maintained by keeping the pressure of 
the helium in the blimp greater than the pressure of the air 
outside, just like the balloons you get at a party.
Chapter 4 Connection

89
UNIT 2 PROPERTIES OF MATTER
Controlling altitude in a blimp 
Inside a blimp’s envelope there are two compartments called 
ballonets. These are bags filled with relatively heavy air (not 
helium). The pilot controls the amount of air in the ballonets 
through air valves. Since air is heavier than helium, the pilot 
deflates or inflates the ballonets to make the blimp rise or fall. 
Changing the proportions of air and helium changes the blimp’s 
average density. Just like a hot air balloon, the blimp rises or 
falls until its average density matches the surrounding air.
Blimps in science
Today blimps are used for more than just sporting events and 
advertising. The U.S. Geological Survey has used blimps to fly 
over volcanoes. A blimp is less likely to be damaged by ash than 
a helicopter or plane. 
Blimps are also used to study whales and their behavior. One 
research blimp is outfitted with cameras and equipment for 
tracking whales. Picture taking is much more stable from a 
blimp than from an airplane. The stability allows cameras with 
high-power zoom lenses to take highly detailed pictures from 
far above the ocean surface.

States of Matter
Imagine a liquid substance that can harden rapidly and form an 
exact replica of any container that holds it. The material does 
not burn, boil, melt, or dissolve in any commonly available acid 
or solvent. Once it hardens, it won’t change under normal 
circumstances. What sort of material is this? This substance was 
created in 1907 by a chemist named Leo Baekeland. He called 
the substance Bakelite, and it was the first useful plastic. Since 
then, many more plastics have been developed for many 
different uses. It is hard to imagine life today without plastic!

fluid - a form of matter that flows 
when any force is applied, no 
matter how small. Liquids and 
gases are fluids.
liquid - phase of matter that can

gas - phase of matter with high 
energy molecules that can expand 
to fill a container.
5.1 Liquids and Gases
A fluid is a form of matter that flows when any force is applied, no matter how small. 
Liquids are one kind of fluid, gases are another. You have seen water flow from a faucet 
(or overflow a sink) and felt cool air flow through an open window (or carry the aroma of 
cooking food into your room). What are some other properties of fluids?
Atoms and molecules in liquids and gases
Molecules in a
liquid
The molecules in liquid water have more energy and move around 
much more than do the molecules in ice. In a liquid, molecules can 
slide over and around each other. This is how liquids flow and change 
shape. But the atoms do not have enough energy to completely break 
their bonds with one another. That is why liquids have constant 
volume even though the shape may change.
Molecules in a
gas
As in liquids, molecules in a gas are free to move around and so gas 
flows. However, molecules in a gas have much more energy than 
molecules in a liquid. On average, each molecule has enough energy 
to completely break away from its neighbors. That is why gas 
expands to fill any container (Figure 5.1).
Density of
liquids and
gases
In general, a liquid material is a little less dense than the same 
material in a solid form. This is because the molecules in a liquid 
move around more and take up a little more space. A gas is usually 
much less dense than either a liquid or solid. This is because the 
molecules in a gas are spread out with comparatively large spaces 
between them.

5.1 LIQUIDS AND GASES
CHAPTER 5: STATES OF MATTER
Pressure
Forces in fluids
Think about what happens when you push down on an inflated 
balloon. The downward force you apply creates forces that act 
sideways as well as down. This is very different from what happens 
when you push down on a bowling ball. The ball transmits the force 
directly down. Because fluids change shape, forces in fluids are more 
complicated than forces in solids.
Pressure
A force applied to a fluid creates pressure. Pressure acts in all 
directions, not just the direction of the applied force. When you inflate 
a car tire, you are increasing the pressure in the tire. A pressure of 40 
pounds per square inch means every square inch of the inside of the 
tire feels a force of 40 pounds. This force acts up, down, and sideways 
in all directions inside the tire. The downward portion of the pressure 
force is what holds the body of the car up (Figure 5.2).
The molecular
explanation
What causes pressure? On the microscopic level, pressure comes from 
collisions between atoms. If you had a jar of water, and if there were 
such as thing as an atomic-magnification video camera, you would see 
trillions of atoms bounce off each other and the walls of the jar every 
second (Figure 5.3). Every square centimeter of the inside surface of 
the jar feels a force from the constant impact of atoms. That force is 
what we feel as pressure. Pressure comes from the constant collisions 
of many, many atoms.

UNIT 2 PROPERTIES OF MATTER
intermolecular forces - forces 
between separate atoms and 
molecules that are attractive at a 
distance but repulsive at close 
range.
Intermolecular forces
What
intermolecular
forces do
There are two types of forces that act between atoms. The strongest 
forces are between atoms that are bonded together into molecules 
and compounds. These forces act within molecules, such as the forces 
that hold the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together in a water 
molecule. A weaker type of force acts between molecules, or between 
atoms that are not bound together in molecules. These in-between 
forces are called intermolecular forces. For example, intermolecular 
forces hold water molecules together in liquid water and in ice.
Properties of
intermolecular
forces
At distances greater than the size of the molecule, intermolecular 
forces are attractive and pull molecules together. Once molecules 
become close enough to touch, intermolecular forces become 
repulsive. This is what prevents one molecule from overlapping 
another. Intermolecular forces pull molecules together at long range 
and hold them apart at short range. 
The role of
thermal energy
The phases of matter — solid, liquid, gas — exist because of  
competition between thermal energy and intermolecular forces. 
Intermolecular forces always try to bring molecules close. Thermal 
energy causes molecules to vibrate and spread apart. 
Explaining the
phases of matter
When molecules have a lot of thermal energy (high temperature), 
intermolecular forces are completely overcome and the molecules 
spread apart, as in a gas. When molecules have a medium amount of 
thermal energy, they come together to form a liquid. In a liquid, the 
molecules have enough thermal energy to partially overcome 
intermolecular forces and move around, but not enough energy to 
completely escape. When molecules have a low amount of thermal 
energy, the intermolecular forces dominate and molecules become 
fixed in place as a solid.

5.1 LIQUIDS AND GASES
CHAPTER 5: STATES OF MATTER
Melting and boiling
Melting point
The melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes 
from a solid to a liquid. For example, the melting point of water is zero 
degrees Celsius. Different substances have different melting points 
because intermolecular forces have different strengths in different 
substances. Stronger forces require more energy to break.  For 
example, iron melts at a much higher temperature than water, about 
1,500°C. The difference in melting points tells us that the 
intermolecular forces in iron are stronger than they are in water.
Boiling
When enough thermal energy is added, intermolecular forces are 
completely overcome and a liquid becomes a gas. The temperature at 
which a liquid becomes a gas is called the boiling point. For water, 
the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius. That is the temperature at 
which liquid water becomes a gas (steam). Boiling takes place within a 
liquid as bubbles of gas particles form and rise to the surface 
(Figure 5.4).
Changes in state
require energy
It takes energy to overcome intermolecular forces. This explains a 
peculiar thing that happens when a substance melts or boils. As heat 
energy is added to ice, the temperature increases until it reaches 0°C. 
Then the temperature stops increasing. As you add more heat, more ice 
becomes liquid water but the temperature stays the same. This is 
because the added energy is being used to break the intermolecular 
forces and change solid into liquid. Once all the ice has become liquid, 
the temperature starts to rise again if more energy is added.

Materials have a wide range of melting and boiling points. This is

temperature, others to be liquid, and still others to be gas. Table 5.1 
gives the melting and boiling points for some ordinary materials.
Water is
less dense in
solid form
Most materials have a higher density as a 
solid than as a liquid. Water is a notable 
exception. Solid water has an open crystal 
structure that resembles a honeycomb, where 
each water molecule forms intermolecular 
bonds with four other water molecules. This 
creates a six-sided arrangement of molecules. 
The six-sided crystal form explains the six-
way symmetry you see when you examine 
snowflakes with a magnifying lens.
Decreasing
density
As water freezes, molecules of water separate slightly from each 
other because of the honeycomb structure. This causes the volume to 
increase slightly, while the mass stays the same. As a result the 
density decreases. This explains why water expands when it is frozen 
and also floats. The density of ice is about 0.92 g/cm3 whereas the 
density of water is about 1.0 g/cm3.
Water’s density
and living
organisms
Because ice is less dense than liquid water, it floats on the surface of 
lakes and ponds when they freeze over in winter. When this occurs, 
the temperature of the water below the ice layer remains above 
freezing. This is one factor that helps fish and other aquatic 
organisms to survive over long, cold winters (Figure 5.5).
Oxygen and nitrogen are ordinarily gases at room temperature. If the 
temperature gets low enough, however, these materials become 
liquid and even solid. Liquid nitrogen at -196°C is used to rapidly 
freeze or cool materials. Liquid oxygen is used in rockets because in 
outer space there is no gaseous oxygen for burning rocket fuel.

5.1 LIQUIDS AND GASES
CHAPTER 5: STATES OF MATTER
Evaporation and condensation
Evaporation
Evaporation occurs when molecules go from liquid to gas at 
temperatures below the boiling point. Evaporation happens because 
temperature measures the average kinetic energy of molecules. Some 
have energy above the average and some below the average. Some of 
the highest-energy molecules have enough energy to break bonds with 
their neighbors and become a gas if they are near the surface. These 
high-energy molecules are the source of evaporation.
Evaporation
cools liquids
Evaporation takes energy away from a liquid because the molecules 
that escape are the ones with the most energy. The average energy of 
the molecules left behind is lowered. That is why your body sweats on 
a hot day. The evaporation of sweat from your skin cools your body by 
carrying away energy (Figure 5.6).
Condensation
Condensation occurs when molecules go from gas to liquid at 
temperatures below the boiling point (Figure 5.7). Condensation 
occurs because water vapor molecules with less than the average 
energy stick to a cool surface forming drops of liquid water. 
Condensation raises the temperature of a gas because atoms in a gas 
have more energy than atoms in a liquid. Low-energy atoms condense 
into liquid, leaving the higher-energy (warmer) atoms in the gas.
Relative
humidity
Ordinary air contains some water vapor. Evaporation adds water 
vapor to the air. Condensation removes water vapor. The percentage 
of water vapor in the air is a balance between evaporation and 
condensation. When air is saturated, it means evaporation and 
condensation are exactly balanced. If you try to add more water vapor 
to saturated air, it condenses immediately back into liquid again. The 
relative humidity tells how close the air is to saturation. When the 
relative humidity is 100 percent, the air is completely saturated. That 
means any water vapor that evaporates from your skin is immediately 
condensed again, which is why you feel hot and sticky when the 
humidity is high. 
Figure 5.6: Sweat evaporating from 
skin removes energy and cools the body.
Figure 5.7: Dew forms when water 
vapor in air condenses into droplets.

liquid to gas at a temperature

convection - the transfer of heat 
through the motion of fluids such 
as air and water.
Convection
What is
convection?
Convection is the transfer of heat through the motion of fluids such 
as air and water. If you have warmed your hands over a fire, you have 
felt convection. Heat from the flame was transferred to your hand by 
the upward movement of air.
Natural
convection
Convection occurs because fluids expand when they heat up. Since 
expansion increases volume, but not mass, the density of a warm 
fluid becomes lower than the density of surrounding cooler fluid, 
causing the warmer fluid to float upward. In a pot on the stove, hot 
water circulates to the top and cooler water sinks to the bottom. This 
circulating flow is called natural convection.
Forced
convection
In many buildings and houses, a boiler heats water that is then 
pumped throughout the structure to distribute the heat. Since the 
heat is being carried by a moving fluid, this is another example of 
convection. However, the flow is created by pumps, which makes this 
an example of forced convection. Natural convection also occurs in the 
same system. The heat from a hot radiator warms the air in a room  
by natural convection. The warmer air rises and cooler air is drawn 
from the far side of the room. The cooler air is then warmed and rises, 
creating circulation that spreads heat through the room.

CHAPTER 5: STATES OF MATTER
The atmosphere of Earth
Air is not
“nothing”
Air feels “light” because it is 1,000 times less dense than water. Air 
may seem like “nothing” but all the oxygen our bodies need and all the 
carbon needed by plants comes from air. As a tree grows, you will not 
see soil disappear to provide mass for the tree. After oxygen and 
hydrogen (from water), the most abundant element in a tree is carbon. 
All of those carbon atoms come from carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air.
Air is a mixture
of gases
Air is the most important gas to living things on the Earth. The 
atmosphere of Earth is a mixture of gases (Figure 5.9). Molecular 
nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) account for 97.2 percent of the mass of 
air. Argon and water vapor make up most of the rest.
Atmospheric
pressure
Gravity creates pressure because fluids have mass and therefore 
weight. The Earth’s atmosphere has a pressure due to the weight of 
air. The density of air is low, but then the atmosphere is more than 
80,000 meters deep (Figure 5.10).
Weather
Earth’s weather is created by gigantic 
convection currents in the 
atmosphere. Energy from the sun 
mostly passes through the atmosphere 
to warm the ground. Air near the 
ground becomes warm and expands. 
Warmer air is less dense than cold air 
and therefore the warm air near the 
ground rises. 
How rain forms
Over the oceans, the warm air may be nearly saturated with water 
vapor. At high altitude, the temperature of the atmosphere drops 
rapidly. As the temperature drops, the ability of the air to hold water 
vapor also decreases. That excess water vapor condenses to create rain 
and other forms of precipitation.

5.2 SOLID MATTER
CHAPTER 5: STATES OF MATTER
5.2 Solid Matter
You have learned that matter is made up of atoms and molecules. In a solid the atoms or 
molecules are closely packed and stay in place, which is why solids hold their shape. In 
this section you will learn how the properties of solids result from the behavior of atoms 
and molecules.
The molecular structure of solids
Why solids are
solid
In a solid, thermal energy is not enough to overcome intermolecular 
forces of attraction. Individual molecules are bound together tightly 
enough that they do not change their positions as they do in liquids 
and gases. Imagine that the molecules in a solid are connected by 
springs (Figure 5.11) that represent the intermolecular forces. 
Thermal energy keeps the molecules moving, but because of those  
intermolecular forces, they only “spring” back and forth around the 
same average position. That is why solid materials hold their shape.
Solids
hold their shape
Because the molecules are bound to each other, all solids have some 
ability to hold their shape when forces are applied. Some solids, like 
steel, can hold their shape under much greater forces than others, like 
rubber (Figure 5.12). Many solids, like plastic, have properties 
between the softness of rubber and the hardness of steel. Engineers 
design the molecular structures of solids to have the properties that 
are needed for given applications. 
Physical
properties of
solids
Some important physical properties of solids are:
• Density: mass per-unit volume.
• Strength: the ability to maintain shape under great force.
• Elasticity: the ability to stretch and return to the same shape.
• Ductility: the ability to bend without breaking.
• Thermal conductivity: the ability to transmit heat energy.
• Electrical conductivity: the ability to allow electricity to flow.
Figure 5.11: Atoms in a solid are 
connected by bonds that act like springs. 
The atoms still vibrate but stay in the 
same average position relative to each 
other.
Figure 5.12: Steel and rubber are 
both solids but they have different 
strengths, or abilities to hold their shape 
under force.
solid - a phase of matter with a 
definite shape and constant 
volume.

104
UNIT 2 PROPERTIES OF MATTER
Figure 5.13: Brittleness is the 
tendency of a solid to crack when force is 
applied.
strength - the ability to maintain 
shape under the application of 
forces.
elasticity - the ability to be 
stretched or compressed and then 
return to original size.
brittleness - the tendency to 
crack or break; the opposite of 
elasticity.
ductility - the ability to bend 
without breaking.
Mechanical properties
The meaning of
“strength”
When you apply a force to an 
object, the object may change its 
size, shape, or both. The concept 
of “strength” describes the 
ability of a solid object to 
maintain its shape even when 
force is applied. The strength of 
an object depends on the 
answers to the two questions in 
the diagram. 
Elasticity
If you pull on a rubber band, its shape changes. If you let it go, the 
rubber band returns to its original shape. Rubber bands can stretch 
many times their original length before breaking, a property called 
elasticity. Elasticity describes a solid’s ability to be stretched and 
then return to its original size. This property also gives objects the 
ability to bounce and to withstand impact without breaking.
Brittleness
Brittleness is defined as the tendency of a solid to crack or break 
before stretching very much. Glass is a good example of a brittle 
material. You cannot stretch glass even one-tenth of a percent (0.001) 
before it breaks. To stretch or shape glass you need to heat the glass 
until it is almost melted. Heating causes molecules to move faster, 
temporarily breaking the forces that hold them together.
Ductility
One of the most useful properties of metals is that they are ductile. A 
ductile material can be bent a relatively large amount without 
breaking. For example, a steel fork can be bent in half and the steel 
does not break. A plastic fork cracks when it is bent only a small 
amount. Steel’s high ductility means steel can be formed into useful 
shapes by pounding, rolling, and bending. These processes would 
destroy a brittle material like glass.

105
5.2 SOLID MATTER
CHAPTER 5: STATES OF MATTER
Crystalline solids
Crystalline
solids
Almost everyone would recognize this solid as a 
crystal. In science, however, crystal has a broader 
meaning. The atoms (or molecules) in a solid can 
be arranged in two fundamentally different ways. 
If the atoms are in an orderly, repeating pattern, 
the solid is called crystalline. Examples of 
crystalline solids include salts, minerals, and 
metals. The geode in the picture is a mineral 
crystal.
Many solids are
crystalline
Most naturally occurring solids on Earth are crystalline. This is most 
evident when materials exist as single crystals, like salt, for instance. 
If you look at a crystal of table salt under a microscope, you see it is 
cubic in shape. If you could examine the arrangement of atoms, you 
would see the shape of the crystal comes from the cubic arrangement 
of sodium and chlorine atoms (Figure 5.14). The external shape of a 
crystal reflects the internal arrangement of atoms and molecules.
Multicrystal
solids
Metals like steel are also crystalline. They 
don’t look like “crystals” because solid 
metal is made from very tiny crystals fused 
together in a jumble of different 
orientations (Figure 5.14). But on the 
microscopic level, atoms in a metal are 
arranged in regular crystalline patterns. 
The diagram shows two common patterns, 
cubic and hexagonal.
Crystal silicon
One of the most important crystalline elements is silicon. Silicon 
crystals are the foundation of microelectronics. Almost all the 
electronic circuits in cell phones, computers, and innumerable other 
devices are made from pure silicon crystals that have been sliced into 
wafers. Microscopic electric circuits are printed on the silicon wafers. 
The regularity of the silicon atoms in the crystal is what allows 
millions of tiny circuits on a computer “chip” to function identically.
Figure 5.14: The shape of a salt 
crystal is due to the arrangement of 
sodium and chlorine atoms at the 
submicroscopic level.
crystalline - solids that have an 
orderly, repeating pattern of 
molecules or atoms.

crystalline solids and amorphous solids.

plastic part.
amorphous - solids that do not 
have a repeating pattern of 
molecules or atoms.
polymer - material in which 
individual molecules are made of 
long chains of repeating units
Polymers
Plastics
You can probably look around you and see a dozen objects made of 
plastic. Because plastic can be created with an extremely wide range 
of physical properties, this material is used for many things. Some 
plastics are soft, like the polyurethane wheels on in-line skates. 
Other plastics are hard, like the polycarbonate used to make safety 
glasses. Still other plastics are slippery, like the nonstick surfaces on 
cooking pans.
Amorphous
solids
Most plastics are examples of amorphous solids. The word 
amorphous comes from the Greek for “without shape.” Unlike 
crystalline solids, amorphous solids do not have a repeating pattern 
of molecules or atoms (Figure 5.15). Other examples of amorphous 
solids include rubber, wax, and glass.
Polymers
Plastics belong to a family of materials called polymers. The prefix 
“poly” means many. Polymers are materials in which individual 
molecules are made of long chains of repeating units. For example, 
ethylene is a molecule with two carbon and four hydrogen atoms. 
Polyethylene is a polymer made by joining ethylene molecules 
together in a long chain. Pure ethylene is a gas at room temperature. 
Polyethylene is a solid plastic that is used in containers, sandwich 
bags, and innumerable other applications.  
Why polymers
are so useful
Polymers are useful because they have melting points that are well 
above room temperature but much lower than most metals. In their 
liquid state, polymers (plastics) can be easily formed using molds 
(Figure 5.16). When the liquid cools and solidifies, the plastic object 
has good strength and elasticity. By altering the recipe and molecular 
structure it is possible to design polymers that have an incredible 
variety of physical properties.

5.2 SOLID MATTER
CHAPTER 5: STATES OF MATTER
Heat conduction in solids
What is
conduction?
Heat conduction is the transfer of heat by the direct contact of 
particles of matter. When you hold a warm mug of tea or cocoa, you 
experience conduction. Heat is transferred from the mug to your hand. 
Conduction occurs between two materials at different temperatures 
when they are touching each other. Heat can also be transferred by 
conduction through materials. If you stir hot cocoa with a metal spoon, 
heat is transferred from the cocoa through the spoon and to your hand.
How does
conduction
work?
Picture yourself placing a spoon into a mug of hot cocoa. The molecules 
in the cocoa have a higher average kinetic energy than those of the 
spoon. The molecules in the spoon exchange energy with the molecules 
in the cocoa through collisions. The molecules in the spoon spread the 
energy up the handle of the spoon through the intermolecular forces 
between them. Conduction works through collisions and through the  
intermolecular forces between molecules.
Thermal
equilibrium
As the collisions continue, the molecules of the hotter material (the 
cocoa) lose energy and the molecules of the cooler material (the spoon) 
gain energy. The kinetic energy of the hotter material is transferred, 
one collision at a time, to the cooler material. Eventually, both 
materials are at the same temperature. When this happens, they are 
in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium occurs when two bodies 
have the same temperature. No heat flows in thermal equilibrium 
because the temperature is the same in the two materials.
Figure 5.17: Heat flows by 
conduction from the hot cocoa into the 
spoon and up its handle.
heat conduction - the transfer of 
heat by the direct contact of 
particles of matter.
thermal equilibrium - a 
condition where temperatures are 
the same and no heat flows.

UNIT 2 PROPERTIES OF MATTER
Figure 5.18: Because air is a poor 
conductor of heat, a down jacket keeps 
you warm in cold winter.
Figure 5.19: A thermos bottle uses a 
vacuum to prevent heat transfer by 
conduction or convection.
Thermal conductors and insulators
Which state of
matter conducts
best?
Although conduction also occurs in liquids and gases, solids make the 
best conductors because the molecules in a solid are packed close 
together. Because molecules in a gas are spread so far apart, 
relatively few collisions occur, making air, for instance, a poor 
conductor of heat. This explains why materials used to keep things 
warm, such as fiberglass insulation and down jackets, have 
thousands of air tiny spaces inside (Figure 5.18).
Thermal
conductors and
insulators
Materials that conduct heat easily are called thermal conductors and 
those that conduct heat poorly are called thermal insulators. For 
example, metal is a thermal conductor, and a foam cup is a thermal 
insulator. The words conductor and insulator are also used to 
describe a material’s ability to conduct electrical current. In general, 
good electrical conductors like silver, copper, gold, and aluminum are 
also good thermal conductors.
Heat conduction
cannot occur
through a
vacuum
Conduction cannot occur in the vacuum of space where there is no 
matter. A thermos bottle keeps liquids hot for hours using a vacuum. 
A thermos is a container consisting of a bottle surrounded by a 
slightly larger bottle. Air molecules have been removed from the 
space between the bottles to create a vacuum. This prevents heat 
transfer by conduction. A small amount of heat is conducted through 
the cap and the glass where the two walls meet, so eventually the 
contents will cool off (Figure 5.19).

Silly Putty®: Solid or Liquid?
Silly Putty—it’s been a 
popular party favor for 
more than fifty years. 
Your parents probably 
played with it when they 
were kids. Some people 
call it America’s longest 
lasting fad.
It’s easy to understand 
why people like Silly 
Putty. Roll it into a ball, 
and you can bounce it 
around the room. Pull on 
it slowly and it will 
stretch out like a long 
lazy snake. Give it a 
quick yank and it will 
break with a satisfying 
snap.
Have you ever tried to 
smash a ball of Silly Putty with a hammer? It keeps its shape 
every time. However, if you gently press on it with your thumb, 
you can flatten it easily. If you leave a ball of Silly Putty on your 
dresser overnight, in the morning you’ll see that it flattened out 
by itself while you were sleeping.
What’s going on here? 
Silly Putty isn’t easy to categorize. It holds it shape when 
hammered, yet flows into a puddle when left alone overnight. 
No wonder the people who make Silly Putty call it “a real solid 
liquid.”
Rheologists (scientists who study how matter flows and/or 
deforms) have another term for Silly Putty: it’s a viscoelastic 
liquid. 
Viscoelastic is a compound word (like snowman). The visco- part 
comes from the word viscous, which means “resistant to flow.” 
Thick, gooey, slow-flowing liquids like hot fudge sauce are 
viscous. Silly Putty is like that.
You’re probably already familiar with the second half of the 
word. Elastic, in physics terms, describes a material that 
returns to its original shape when deformed.
So, rheologists describe Silly Putty as a slow-flowing, elastic 
liquid.
How did it get that way?
It’s not too surprising that Silly Putty bounces, because it was 
accidentally invented by a chemist looking for a substitute for 
rubber. In 1943, James Wright, a researcher for General 
Electric, dropped some boric acid into silicone oil, creating a 
gooey compound. 
This compound, first called “nutty putty,” was sent to engineers 
around the world—but no practical uses were found. In 1949, a 
man named Peter Hodgson decided to sell it as a toy. He 
borrowed $147 to buy a batch from General Electric, divided the 
batch into one-ounce lumps, and placed each lump into a plastic 
egg. He renamed the compound “Silly Putty” after the main 
ingredient, silicone.
A New Yorker magazine reporter wrote an article about Silly 
Putty in 1950, and afterward Hodgson received 250,000 orders 
in three days. Silly Putty was a hit!
Inside Silly 
Putty
The silicone oil 
used to make 
Silly Putty is 
known to 
chemists as 
polydimethylsilo
xane, or PDMS. 
PDMS is a 
Chapter 5 Connection

111
UNIT 2 PROPERTIES OF MATTER
polymer, which means each molecule is made up of long chain 
of identical smaller molecules.
When boric acid is added to the long chains of PDMS, boron 
crosslinks begin to form. This means that the boron hooks 
chains of PDMS molecules together like this:
These boron crosslinks are not very strong. Remember that 
molecules in solids and liquids are always in motion. This 
motion breaks boron crosslinks, but over time new crosslinks 
form. This action is called dynamic (changing) crosslinking.
Because of this dynamic crosslinking, Silly Putty reacts one 
way to quick forces and another way to long-acting forces.
When you strike Silly Putty with a hammer, the Silly Putty 
reacts like an elastic solid: it bounces back. That’s because most 
of the boron crosslinks remain in place during the split second 
of the hammer’s strike.
When you leave a ball of Silly Putty untouched overnight, the 
boron crosslinks that help Silly Putty hold its shape have about 
eight hours to break down. Over that time, molecular motion 
breaks many of the original crosslinks. Gravitational force 
constantly pulls the PDMS molecules downward, and in the 
morning you’re left with a Silly Putty puddle.

There is something more to wintergreen-flavored candy (the 
kind with the hole in the middle) than the refreshing taste. 
When you bite and crush one of these candies, blue sparks jump 
out of your mouth! You can only see the sparks if you hold a 
mirror up to your mouth in a very dark place, like a closet. You 
will be able to see the light even better if you crush one of the 
candies with a pair of pliers (no mirror required). To understand 
why the blue sparks appear, you must know what an atom is 
and what it is made of. After reading this chapter on atoms, you 
can do an Internet search on the term triboluminescence to find 
out why this candy sparks when you crush it.

UNIT 3: ATOMS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Figure 6.1: Just as normal matter is 
divided into atoms, electric charge 
appears only in units of the elementary 
charge, e.
electric charge - a fundamental 
property of matter that comes in 
two types called positive and 
negative.
elementary charge - the 
smallest unit of electric charge that 
is possible in ordinary matter; 
represented by the lowercase 
letter e.
6.1 Fundamental Particles and Forces
Scientists once believed that atoms were the smallest particles of matter. With the 
advancement of technology, it became clear that atoms themselves are made of simpler 
particles. Today, we believe all atoms are made of three basic particles: the proton, 
electron, and neutron. Astonishingly, the incredible variety of matter in universe can be 
constructed using just these three subatomic particles!
Electric charge
Electric charge is
a property of
matter
Along with mass and volume, matter has another fundamental 
property that we call electric charge. In order to understand atoms, 
we need to understand electric charge because one of the forces that 
hold atoms together comes from electric charge.
We know of two different kinds of electric 
charge and we call them positive and 
negative. Because there are two kinds of 
charge, the force between electric charges can 
be either attractive or repulsive. A positive 
and a negative charge will attract each other. 
Two positive charges will repel each other. 
Two negative charges will also repel each 
other. 
The elementary
charge
We use the letter e to represent the elementary charge. On the 
atomic scale, electric charge always comes in units of +e or -e. It is 
only possible to have charges that are multiples of e, such as +e, +2e, 
-e, -2e, -3e, and so on. Scientists believe it is impossible for ordinary 
matter to have charges that are fractions of e. For example, a charge 
of +0.5e is impossible in ordinary matter. Electric charge only 
appears in units of the elementary charge.

6.1 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES AND FORCES
CHAPTER 6: THE ATOM
Static electricity
Neutral means
zero charge
We say an object is electrically neutral when its total electric charge is 
zero (Figure 6.2). Your pencil, your textbook, even your body are 
electrically neutral, at least most of the time. These forms of matter 
are made up of charged particles, which you don’t usually notice 
because there is perfect cancellation between positive and negative, 
leaving a net charge of precisely zero.
Charged objects
An object is charged when its total electric charge is not zero. Objects 
become charged when they have an excess of either positive or 
negative electric charge. 
Static electricity
and charge
A tiny imbalance of positive or negative charge is the cause of static 
electricity. If two neutral objects are rubbed together, the friction 
often pulls some charge off one object and puts it temporarily on the 
other. This is what happens to clothes in the dryer and to your socks 
when you walk on a carpet. The static electricity you feel when taking 
clothes from a dryer or scuffing your socks on carpet typically results 
from an excess charge of less than one part in a hundred trillion!
What causes
shocks
The forces between electric charges are 
incredibly strong. That is why charged objects 
do not stay charged very long. An object with 
excess positive charge strongly attracts 
negative charge until the object becomes 
neutral again. When you walk across a carpet 
on a dry day, your body picks up excess 
negative charge. If you touch a neutral door 
knob your negative charge repels negative 
charge in the door knob causing the doorknob 
to become slightly positive. The negative 
charge on your skin is now attracted to the 
positive charge on the doorknob. The shock you feel is the energy 
released when your excess negative charge jumps the gap between 
your skin and the door knob.
Figure 6.2: An object is neutral if it 
has an equal number of positive and 
negative charges. 
neutral - a condition where the 
total positive charge is canceled by 
the total negative charge. Matter is 
neutral most of the time.
charged - a condition where 
there is an excess of positive or 
negative charge.
static electricity - the buildup of 
either positive or negative charge; 
made up of isolated, motionless 
charges.

Figure 6.3: Rutherford’s famous 
experiment led to the discovery of the 
nucleus.
electron - a particle with an 
electric charge (-e) found inside of 
atoms but outside the nucleus.
proton - a particle with an electric 
charge (+e) found in the nucleus of 
atoms.
neutron - a particle with zero 
charge found in the nucleus of 
atoms.
nucleus - the tiny core at the 
center of an atom containing most 
of the atom’s mass and all of its 
positive charge.
Inside an atom: solving the puzzle
The electron
identified
The first strong evidence that something existed smaller than an 
atom came in 1897. English physicist J. J. Thomson discovered that 
electricity passing through a gas caused the gas to give off particles 
that were too small to be atoms. Thomson’s new particles also had 
negative electric charge while atoms have zero electric charge. 
Thomson called his particles corpuscles, which were eventually 
named electrons, and proposed that they came from the inside of 
atoms.
The proton and
the nucleus
discovered
In 1911, Ernest Rutherford, Hans Geiger, and Ernest Marsden did a 
clever experiment to test Thomson’s model of the atom. They 
launched positively-charged helium ions (a charged atom is called an 
ion) at extremely thin gold foil (Figure 6.3). They expected the helium 
ions to be deflected a small amount as they passed through the foil.  
However, a few bounced back in the direction they came! The 
unexpected result prompted Rutherford to remark “it was as if you 
fired a five inch (artillery) shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came 
back and hit you!”
The nuclear
model of the
atom
The best way to explain the pass-through result was if the gold atoms 
were mostly empty space, allowing most of the helium ions to go 
through virtually undeflected. The best way to explain the bounce-
back result was if nearly all the mass of a gold atom were 
concentrated in a tiny, hard core at the center. Further experiments 
confirmed Rutherford’s ideas and we know that every atom has a tiny 
nucleus, which contains more than 99% of the atom’s mass.
The neutron
The positively charged proton was soon discovered and shown to be 
the particle in the nucleus. But there still was a serious problem with 
the atomic model. Protons could only account for about half the 
observed mass. This problem was solved in 1932 by James Chadwick. 
Chadwick’s experiments revealed another particle in the nucleus 
which has no electric charge and similar mass as the proton. 
Chadwicks neutral particle was named the neutron. 

121
6.1 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES AND FORCES
CHAPTER 6: THE ATOM
Three subatomic particles make up an atom
Protons,
neutrons, and
electrons
Today we know that atoms are made of three tiny subatomic particles: 
protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons have positive charge. 
Electrons have negative charge. Neutrons add mass but have zero 
charge. The charge on a proton (+e) and an electron (-e) are exactly 
equal and opposite. Atoms that have the same number of protons and 
electrons have a total charge of precisely zero.
The nucleus
The protons and neutrons are grouped together in the nucleus, which 
is at the center of the atom. The mass of the nucleus determines the 
mass of an atom because protons and neutrons are much larger and 
more massive than electrons (Figure 6.4). In fact, a proton is 1,836 
times heavier than an electron. All atoms have both protons and 
neutrons in their nuclei except the simplest type of hydrogen, which 
only has one proton and no neutrons. The chart below compares 
electrons, protons, and neutrons in terms of charge and mass. 
Electrons define
the volume of an
atom
Electrons take up the region outside the nucleus in a region called the 
electron cloud. The diameter of an atom is really the diameter of the 
electron cloud (Figure 6.5). Compared to the tiny nucleus, the electron 
cloud is enormous, more than 10,000 times larger than the nucleus. As 
a comparison, if an atom were the size of a football stadium, the 
nucleus would be the size of a pea, and the electrons would be 
equivalent to a small swarm of gnats buzzing around the stadium at 
extremely high speed. Can you visualize how much empty space there 
would be in the stadium? The atom is mostly empty space!
Figure 6.4: The mass of at atom is 
mostly in the nucleus because protons 
and neutrons are much heavier than 
electrons. 
Figure 6.5: The overall size of an 
atom is the size of its electron cloud. The 
nucleus is much, much smaller.

UNIT 3: ATOMS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Figure 6.6: The negative electrons 
are attracted to the positive protons in 
the nucleus, but their momentum keeps 
them from falling in.  
Figure 6.7: When enough neutrons 
are present the strong nuclear force wins 
out over the repulsion between positively 
charged protons and pulls the nucleus 
together tightly. The strong nuclear 
force is the strongest force in the 
universe that we know.
Forces inside atoms
Electromagnetic
forces
Electrons are bound to the nucleus by the attractive force between 
electrons (-) and protons (+). The electrons don’t fall into the nucleus 
because they have kinetic energy. The energy of an electron causes it 
to move around the nucleus instead of falling in (Figure 6.6). A good 
analogy is Earth orbiting the sun. Gravity creates a force that pulls 
the Earth toward the sun. Earth’s kinetic energy causes it to orbit the 
sun rather than fall straight in. While electrons don’t really move in 
orbits, the energy analogy is approximately right.
Strong nuclear
force
Because of electric force, all the positively charged protons in the 
nucleus repel each other. What holds the nucleus together? There is 
another force that is even stronger than the electric force. We call it 
the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force is the strongest 
force known to science (Figure 6.7). This force attracts neutrons and 
protons to each other and works only at the extremely small 
distances inside the nucleus. If there are enough neutrons, the 
attraction from the strong nuclear force wins out over repulsion from 
the electromagnetic force and the nucleus stays together. In every 
atom heavier than helium, there is at least one neutron for every 
proton in the nucleus.
Weak force
There is another nuclear force called the weak force. The weak force is 
weaker than both the electric force and the strong nuclear force. If 
you leave a single neutron outside the nucleus, the weak force 
eventually causes it to break down into a proton and an electron. The 
weak force does not play an important role in a stable atom, but 
comes into action in certain special cases when atoms break apart.
Gravity
The force of gravity inside the atom is much weaker even than the 
weak force. It takes a relatively large mass to create enough gravity 
to make a significant force. We know that particles inside an atom do 
not have enough mass for gravity to be an important force on the 
scale of atoms. But there are many unanswered questions. 
Understanding how gravity works inside atoms is an unsolved 
mystery in science.

6.1 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES AND FORCES
CHAPTER 6: THE ATOM
How atoms of different elements are different
The atomic
number is the
number of
protons
How is an atom of one element different from an atom of another 
element? The atoms of different elements contain different numbers of 
protons in the nucleus. For example, all atoms of carbon have six 
protons in the nucleus and all atoms of hydrogen have one proton in 
the nucleus (Figure 6.8). Because the number of protons is so 
important, it is called the atomic number. The atomic number of an 
element is the number of protons in the nucleus of every atom of that 
element. 
Atoms of the same element always have the 
same number of protons in the nucleus.
Elements have
unique atomic
numbers
Each element has a unique atomic 
number. On a periodic table of 
elements, the atomic number is 
usually written above or below the 
atomic symbol. An atom with only 
one proton in its nucleus is the 
element hydrogen, atomic 
number 1. An atom with six 
protons is the element carbon, 
atomic number 6. Atoms with 
seven protons are nitrogen, atoms 
with eight protons are oxygen, and 
so on.
Complete atoms
are electrically
neutral
Because protons and electrons attract each other with very large 
forces, the number of protons and electrons in a complete atom is 
always equal. For example, hydrogen has one proton in its nucleus 
and one electron outside the nucleus. The total electric charge of a 
hydrogen atom is zero because the negative charge of the electron 
cancels the positive charge of the proton. Each carbon atom has six 
electrons, one for each of carbon’s six protons. Like hydrogen, a 
complete carbon atom is electrically neutral.
Figure 6.8: Atoms of the same 
element always have the same number 
of protons.
atomic number - the number of 
protons in the nucleus. The atomic 
number determines what element 
the atom represents.

Figure 6.9: The isotopes of carbon.
isotopes - atoms of the same 
element that have different 
numbers of neutrons in the 
nucleus.
mass number - the number of 
protons plus the number of 
neutrons in the nucleus.
Isotopes
Isotopes
All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons in 
the nucleus. However, atoms of the same element may have different 
numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. Isotopes are atoms of the same 
element that have different numbers of neutrons.
The isotopes of
carbon
Figure 6.9 shows three isotopes of carbon that exist in nature. Most 
carbon atoms have six protons and six neutrons in the nucleus. 
However, some carbon atoms have seven or eight neutrons. They are 
all carbon atoms because they all contain six protons, but they are 
different isotopes of carbon. The isotopes of carbon are called carbon-
12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. The number after the name is called 
the mass number. The mass number of an isotope tells you the 
number of protons plus the number of neutrons.

number of

125
6.1 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES AND FORCES
CHAPTER 6: THE ATOM
Radioactivity
What if there are
too many
neutrons?
Almost all elements have one or more isotopes that are stable. 
“Stable” means the nucleus stays together. For complex reasons, the 
nucleus of an atom becomes unstable if it contains too many or too few 
neutrons relative to the number of protons. If the nucleus is unstable, 
it breaks apart. Carbon has two stable isotopes, carbon-12 and carbon-
13. Carbon-14 is radioactive because it has an unstable nucleus. An 
atom of carbon-14 eventually changes into an atom of nitrogen-14.
Radioactivity
If an atomic nucleus is unstable for any reason, the atom eventually 
changes into a more stable form. Radioactivity is a process in which 
the nucleus spontaneously emits particles or energy as it changes into 
a more stable isotope. Radioactivity can change one element into a 
completely different element. For example carbon 14 is radioactive 
and eventually becomes nitrogen 14.
Alpha decay
In alpha decay, the nucleus ejects two protons and two neutrons 
(Figure 6.10). Check the periodic table and you can quickly show that 
two protons and two neutrons are the nucleus of a helium-4 (4He) 
atom. Alpha radiation is actually fast-moving 4He nuclei. When alpha 
decay occurs, the atomic number is reduced by two because two 
protons are removed. The atomic mass is reduced by four because two 
neutrons go along with the two protons. For example, uranium-238 
undergoes alpha decay to become thorium-234. 
Beta decay
Beta decay occurs when a neutron in the nucleus splits into a proton 
and an electron. The proton stays in the nucleus, but the high energy 
electron is ejected and is called beta radiation. During beta decay, the 
atomic number increases by one because one new proton is created. 
The mass number stays the same because the atom lost a neutron but 
gained a proton.
Gamma decay
Gamma decay is how the nucleus gets rid of excess energy. In gamma 
decay the nucleus emits pure energy in the form of gamma rays. The 
number of protons and neutrons stays the same.
Figure 6.10: Two common 
radioactive decay reactions.
stable - a nucleus is stable if it 
stays together.
radioactive - a nucleus is 
radioactive if it spontaneously 
breaks up, emitting particles or 
energy in the process.

6.2 ELECTRONS IN THE ATOM
CHAPTER 6: THE ATOM
6.2 Electrons in the Atom
Virtually all the properties of the elements (except mass) are due to the electrons outside 
the nucleus. Atoms interact with each other through their electrons. Chemical bonds 
involve only electrons so electrons determine how atoms combine into compounds. The 
rich variety of matter we experience comes directly from the complex behavior of 
electrons inside atoms. Exactly how electrons create the properies of matter was a puzzle 
that took bright scientists a long time to figure out!
The spectrum
The spectrum
Almost all the light you see comes from atoms. For example, light is 
given off when electricity passes through the gas in a fluorescent bulb 
or neon sign. When scientists look carefully at the light given off by a 
pure element, they find that the light does not include all colors. 
Instead, they see a few very specific colors, and the colors are different 
for different elements (Figure 6.13). Hydrogen has a red line, a green 
line, a blue and a violet line in a characteristic pattern. Helium and 
lithium have different colors and patterns. Each different element has 
its own characteristic pattern of colors called a spectrum. The colors 
of clothes, paint, and everything else around you come from this 
property of elements to emit or absorb light of only certain colors. 
Spectroscopes
and spectral lines
Each individual color in a spectrum is called a spectral line because 
each color appears as a line in a spectroscope. A spectroscope is a 
device that spreads light into its different colors. The diagram below 
shows a spectroscope made with a prism. The spectral lines appear on 
the screen on the right.
Figure 6.13: When light from 
energized atoms is directed through a 
prism, spectral lines are observed. Each 
element has its own distinct pattern of 
spectral lines.
spectrum - the characteristic 
colors of light given off or 
absorbed by an element.
spectroscope - an instrument 
that separates light into a 
spectrum.
spectral line - a bright colored 
line in a spectroscope.

UNIT 3: ATOMS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Figure 6.14: When the right amount 
of energy is absorbed, an electron in a 
hydrogen atom jumps to a higher energy 
level. When the electron falls back to the 
lower energy, the atom releases the same 
amount of energy it absorbed. The 
energy comes out as light of a specific 
color.
The Bohr model of the atom
Energy and color
Light is a form of pure energy. The amount of energy determines the 
color of the light. Red light has low energy and blue light has higher 
energy. Green and yellow light have energy between red and blue. 
The fact that atoms only emit certain colors of light tells us that 
something inside an atom can only have certain values of energy.
Neils Bohr
Danish physicist Neils Bohr proposed the concept of energy levels to 
explain the spectrum of hydrogen. In Bohr’s model, the electron in a 
hydrogen atom must be in a specific energy level. You can think of 
energy levels like steps on a staircase. You can be on one step or 
another, but you cannot be between steps except in passing. 
Electrons must be in one energy level or another and cannot remain 
in between energy levels. Electrons change energy levels by 
absorbing or emitting light (Figure 6.14).
Explaining the
spectrum
When an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower one, 
the atom gives up the energy difference between the two levels. The 
energy comes out as different colors of light. The specific colors of the 
spectral lines correspond to the differences in energy between the 
energy levels. The diagram below shows how the spectral lines of 
hydrogen come from electrons falling from the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th 
enegry levels down to the 2nd energy level.

129
6.2 ELECTRONS IN THE ATOM
CHAPTER 6: THE ATOM
Electrons and energy levels
The electron
cloud
Bohr’s model of electron energy levels was incomplete. Electrons are 
so fast and light that their exact position within an atom cannot be 
defined. In the current model of the atom, we think of the electrons in 
an atom as moving around the nucleus in an area called an electron 
cloud. The energy levels occur because electrons in the cloud are at 
different average distances from the nucleus.
The energy levels
are at different
distances from
the nucleus
The positive nucleus attracts negative electrons like gravity attracts a 
ball down a hill. The farther down the “hill” an electron slides, the less 
energy it has. Conversely, electrons have more energy farther up the 
hill, and away from the nucleus. The higher energy levels are farther 
from the nucleus and the lower energy levels are closer to the nucleus.
Rules for energy
levels
Inside an atom, electrons behave in certain ways:
• The energy of an electron must match one of the energy levels in
the atom.
• Each energy level can hold only a certain number of electrons, and
no more.
• As electrons are added to an atom, they settle into the lowest
unfilled energy level.
Quantum
mechanics
Energy levels are predicted by quantum mechanics, the branch of 
physics that deals with the microscopic world of atoms. While 
quantum mechanics is outside the scope of this book, you should know 
that it is a very accurate theory and it explains energy levels. 
Orbitals
The energy levels in an atom 
are grouped into different 
shapes called orbitals. 
The s-orbital is spherical and 
holds two electrons. The first 
two electrons in each energy 
level are in the s-orbital.
The p-orbitals hold 6 electrons 
and are aligned along the three 
directions on a 3-D graph.

Figure 6.15: Electrons occupy energy 
levels around the nucleus. The farther 
away an electron is from the nucleus, 
the higher the energy it possesses.
Figure 6.16: A helium atom has two 
protons in its nucleus and two electrons.
The energy levels in an atom
How electrons fill
in the energy
levels
The first energy level can accept up to two electrons. The second and 
third energy levels hold up to eight electrons each. The fourth and 
fifth energy levels hold 18 electrons (Figure 6.15). A good analogy is 
to think of the electron cloud like a parking garage in a crowded city. 
The first level of the garage only has spaces for two cars, just as the 
first energy level only has spaces for two electrons. The second level 
of the garage can hold eight cars just as the second energy level can 
hold eight electrons. Each new car that enters the garage parks in the 
lowest unfilled space, just as each additional electron occupies the 
lowest unfilled energy level.
How the energy
levels fill
The number of electrons in an atom depends on the atomic number 
because the number of electrons equals the number of protons. That 
means each element has a different number of electrons and 
therefore fills the energy levels to different point. For example, a 
helium atom has two electrons (Figure 6.16). The two electrons 
completely fill up the first energy level (diagram below). The next 
element is lithium with three electrons. Since the first energy level 
only holds two electrons, the third electron must go into the second 
energy level. The diagram shows the first 10 elements which fill the 
first and second energy levels.

Bioluminescence
Imagine you could make your hands glow like living 
flashlights. No more fumbling around for candles when the 
power goes out! You could read in bed all night, or get a job 
directing airplanes to their runways.
Although a glowing 
hand might sound like 
something from a 
science fiction movie, , 
many living things can 
make their own light. 
On warm summer 
evenings, fireflies flash 
signals to attract a 
mate. A fungus known 
as “foxfire” glows in 
decaying wood. 
While there are only a few kinds of glowing creatures that 
live on land, about 90 percent of the animals that live in the 
deep parts of the ocean make their own light!
How do they do that?
Light is a form of energy. To make light, an atom must first 
absorb enough energy to promote an electron up to a higher-
energy state. When the electron falls back to its original 
state, the energy is given off as light.
Atoms can absorb energy from a number of sources. 
Electrical energy is used in ordinary light bulbs. Mechanical 
energy can be used, too. Hit two quartz rocks together in a 
dark room, and you’ll see flashes of light as the electrons you 
pumped up fall back down. You can also use the energy from 
a chemical reaction. When you bend a glow stick, you break a 
vial inside so that two chemicals can combine. When they 
react, energy is released and used to make light.
Bioluminescence
Like a glow stick, living things produce their own light using 
a chemical reaction. We call this process bioluminescence 
(bio- means “living” and luminesce means “to glow”). 
Bioluminescence is “cold light” because it doesn’t produce a 
lot of heat. While it takes a lot of energy for a living thing to 
produce light, almost 100% of the energy becomes visible 
light. In contrast, only 10 percent of the used by an 
“incandescent” electric light bulb is converted to visible light.  
90 percent of the energy is wasted as heat. 
The chemical reaction
Three ingredients are usually needed for a bioluminescent 
reaction to occur: An organic chemical known as luciferin, a 
source of oxygen, and an enzyme called luciferase.
Luciferin and luciferase are categories of chemicals with 
certain characteristics. Luciferin in a firefly is not exactly 
the same as the luciferin in “foxfire” fungus. However, both 
luciferin chemicals are carbon-based and have the ability to 
give off light under certain conditions.
Firefly light
In a firefly, luciferin and luciferase are stored 
in special cells in the abdomen called 
“photocytes.” To create light, fireflies push 
oxygen into the photocytes. When the luciferin 
and luciferase are exposed to oxygen, they 
combine with ATP (a chemical source of 
energy) and magnesium. This chemical 
reaction drives some of the luciferin electrons 
into a higher energy state. As they fall back 
down to their “ground state,” energy is given 
off in the form of visible light.

UNIT 3 ATOMS AND THE  PERIODIC TABLE
Why make light?
Living creatures don’t have an endless supply of energy. 
Since it takes a lot of energy to make light, there must be 
good reasons for doing it.
Fireflies flash their lights in 
patterns to attract a mate. The 
lights also warn predators to stay 
away, because the light-producing 
chemicals taste bitter. They can 
also be used as a distress signal, 
warning others of their species 
that there is danger nearby. The 
female of one firefly species has 
learned to mimic the signal of 
other types of fireflies. She uses 
her light to attract males of other 
species and then she eats them!
It’s a little harder to figure out why foxfire fungus glows. 
Some scientists think that the glow attracts insects that help 
spread around the fungus spores.
Bioluminescent 
ocean creatures 
use their lights in 
amazing ways. The 
deep-sea angler 
fish has a glowing 
lure attached to its 
head. When a 
smaller fish comes 
to munch on the 
lure, it instead is 
gobbled up by the 
angler fish.
Comb jellies (shown below) are some of the ocean’s most 
beautiful glowing creatures. When threatened, they release 
a cloud of bioluminescent particles into the water, 
temporarily blinding the attacker.
So far we know that living 
creatures use 
bioluminescence to attract 
mates, to communicate, to 
find food, and to ward off 
attackers. Perhaps 
someday you will be part of 
a research team that 
discovers even more uses 
for bioluminescence.
Questions: 
1. Find out more about what is inside a glow stick. Make a 
poster to explain how glow sticks work, or prepare a 
demonstration for your classmates
2. Bioluminescence is found in a wide range of living 
organisms, including bacteria, fungi, insects, crustaceans, 
and fish. However, no examples have been found among 
flowering plants, birds, reptiles, amphibians, or mammals. 
Why do you think this is so?
3. Use the Internet or a library to find out more about 
bioluminescent sea creatures. Here are some questions to 
pursue: What is the most common color of light produced? 
What other colors of bioluminescence have been found?

Atoms and Radioactivity
Radioactivity is how we describe any process where the 
nucleus of an atom emits particles or energy. All radioactive 
elements have a half-life. This means that there is a certain 
length of time after which half of the radioactive element has 
decayed. Radioactive elements have an unstable nucleus, 
which decays into an different type of atom with a more 
stable nucleus. As it decays, it releases radiation.
Materials:

What are metals like? Think of things that are made with metals 
like aluminum, copper, iron, and gold. What do they have in 
common? They are usually shiny, and they can often be bent into 
different shapes without breaking. Did you know there is a 
metal that is shiny, but is so soft it can be cut with a knife? This 
metal is very reactive. If you place a piece of this metal in water, 
it will race around the surface, and the heat given off is often 
enough to melt the metal and ignite the hydrogen gas that is 
produced! This strange metal is called sodium. You can look at 
the periodic table of elements to find other metals that behave 
like sodium. In this chapter, you will become familiar with how 
you can predict the properties of different elements by their 
location on the periodic table.

7.1 The Periodic Table of the Elements
Before scientists understood how atoms were put together they were able to identify 
elements by their chemical properties. In this section, you learn how the elements are 
organized in the periodic table, and how an element’s chemical properties are related to 
the arrangement of electrons.
Physical and chemical properties
Physical
properties
Characteristics that you can see through direct observation are called 
physical properties. For example, water is a colorless, odorless 
substance that exists as a liquid at room temperature. Gold is shiny, 
exists as a solid at room temperature, and can be hammered into very 
thin sheets. Physical properties include color, texture, density, 
brittleness, and state (solid, liquid, or gas). Melting point, boiling 
point, and specific heat are also physical properties.
Physical changes
are reversible
Physical changes, such as melting, boiling, or bending are sometimes 
reversible, and no new substances are formed. When water freezes, it 
undergoes a physical change from a liquid to a solid. This does not 
change the water into a new substance. It is still water, only in solid 
form. The change can easily be reversed by melting the water. 
Bending a steel bar is another physical change.
Chemical
properties
Properties that can only be observed when one substance changes 
into a different substance are called chemical properties. For 
example, if you leave an iron nail outside, it will eventually rust 
(Figure 7.1). A chemical property of iron is that it reacts with oxygen 
in the air to form iron oxide (rust). 
Chemical
changes are hard
to reverse
Any change that transforms one substance into a different substance 
is called a chemical change. The transformation of iron into rust is a 
chemical change. Chemical changes are not easily reversible.  Rusted 
iron will not turn shiny again even if you take it away from oxygen in 
the air.

7.1 THE PERIODIC TABLE OF THE ELEMENTS
CHAPTER 7: ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
The periodic table
How many
elements are
there?
In the 18th through 20th centuries, scientists tried to find and catalog 
all the elements that make up our universe. To do so, they had to 
carefully observe substances in order to identify them, and then try to 
break them apart by any possible means. If a substance could be 
chemically broken apart it could not be an element. As of this writing, 
scientists have identified 113 different elements, and five more are 
expected to be confirmed in the near future. Only 88 elements occur 
naturally. The others are made in laboratories.
The modern
periodic table
As chemists worked on determining which substances were elements, 
they noticed that some elements acted like other elements. The soft 
metals lithium, sodium, and potassium always combine with oxygen 
in a ratio of two atoms of metal per atom of oxygen (Figure 7.2). By 
keeping track of how each element combined with other elements, 
scientists began to recognize repeating patterns. From this data, they 
developed the first periodic table of the elements. The periodic table 
organizes the elements according to how they combine with other 
elements (chemical properties).
Organization of
the periodic
table
The periodic table is organized in order 
of increasing atomic number. The 
lightest element (hydrogen) is at the 
upper left. The heaviest (#118) is on the  
lower right. Each element corresponds 
to one box in the periodic table 
identified with the element symbol.
The periodic table is further divided into periods and groups. Each 
horizontal row is called a period. Across any period, the properties of 
the elements gradually change. Each vertical column is called a 
group. Groups of elements have similar properties. The main group 
elements are Groups 1-2 and 13-18 (the tall columns of the periodic 
table) Elements in Groups 3 through 12 are called the transition 
elements. The inner transition elements, called lanthanides and 
actinides, are usually put below to fit on a page.
Figure 7.2: The metals lithium, 
sodium, and potassium all form 
compounds with two atoms of oxygen. 
All the elements in group one of the 
periodic table form compounds with two 
oxygen atoms.

metal - elements that are typically 
shiny and good conductors of heat 
and electricity.
nonmetal - elements that are 
poor conductors of heat and 
electricity.
Reading the periodic table
Metals,
nonmetals, and
metalloids
Most of the elements are metals. A metal is typically shiny, opaque, 
and a good conductor of heat and electricity as a pure element. Metals 
are also ductile, which means they can be bent into different shapes 
without breaking. With the exception of hydrogen, the nonmetals are 
on the right side of the periodic table. Nonmetals are poor conductors 
of heat and electricity. Solid nonmetals are brittle and appear dull. 
The elements on the border between metals and nonmetals are called 
Metalloids. Silicon is an example of a metalloid element with 
properties in between those of metals and nonmetals.

7.1 THE PERIODIC TABLE OF THE ELEMENTS
CHAPTER 7: ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Atomic mass
Atomic mass
units
The mass of individual atoms is so small that the numbers are difficult 
to work with. To make calculations easier scientists define the atomic 
mass unit (amu). One atomic mass unit is about the mass of a single 
proton (or a neutron). In laboratory units, one amu is 1.66 × 10-24 
grams. That is 0.00000000000000000000000166 grams!
Atomic mass and
isotopes
The atomic mass is the average mass (in amu) of an atom of each 
element (chart below). Atomic masses differ from mass numbers 
because most elements in nature contain more than one isotope (see 
chart below). For example, the atomic mass of lithium is 6.94 amu. 
That does NOT mean there are 3 protons and 3.94 neutrons in a 
lithium atom! On average, out of every 100 g of lithium, 94 grams are 
Li-7 and 6 grams are Li-6 (Figure 7.3). The average atomic mass of 
lithium is 6.94 because of the mixture of isotopes. 
Figure 7.3: Naturally occuring 
elements have a mixture of isotopes.
atomic mass unit (amu) - a unit 
of mass equal to 1.66 × 10-24 
grams, which is one twelfth the 
mass of the isotope carbon-12.

alkali metals - elements in the 
first group of the periodic table.
halogens - elements in the group 
containing fluorine, chlorine, and  
bromine, among others.
noble gases - elements in the 
group containing helium, neon, 
and argon, among others.
Groups of the periodic table
Alkali metals
The different groups of the periodic table have similar 
chemical properties. For example the first group is known 
as the alkali metals. This group includes the elements 
lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K). The alkali 
metals are soft and silvery in their pure form and are highly 
reactive. Each of them combines in ratio of two to one with 
oxygen. For example lithium oxide has two atoms of lithium 
per atom of oxygen.
Group 2 metals
The group two metals include beryllium (Be), magnesium 
(Mg), and calcium (Ca). These metals also form oxides 
however they combine one-to-one with oxygen. For example, 
beryllium oxide has one beryllium atom per oxygen atom.
Halogens
The halogens are on the opposite side of the periodic table. 
These elements tend to be toxic gases or liquids in their 
pure form. Some examples are fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), 
and bromine (Br). The halogens are also very reactive and 
are rarely found in pure form. When combined with alkali 
metals, they form salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl) and 
potassium chloride (KCl).
Noble gases
On the far right of the periodic table are the noble gases, 
including the elements helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon 
(Ar). These elements do not naturally form chemical bonds 
with other atoms and are almost always found in their pure 
state. They are sometimes called inert gases for this reason.
Transition metals
In the middle of the periodic table are the transition metals, 
including titanium (Ti), iron (Fe), and copper (Cu). These 
elements are usually good conductors of heat and electricity. 
For example the wires that carry electricity in your school 
are made of copper.

CHAPTER 7: ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Energy levels and the periodic table
The periodic
table
The periods (rows) of the periodic table correspond to the energy levels 
in the atom (Figure 7.4).  The first energy level can accept up to two 
electrons. Hydrogen has one electron and helium has two. These two 
elements complete the first period.
Row 2 is the
second energy
level
The next element, lithium (Li), has three electrons. Lithium begins 
the second period because the third electron goes into the second 
energy level. The second energy level can hold eight electrons so there 
are eight elements in the second row of the periodic table, ending with 
neon. Neon (Ne) has 10 electrons, which completely fills the second 
energy level. 
Row 3 is the third
energy level
Potassium (K) has 11 electrons, and starts the third period because 
the eleventh electron goes into the third energy level. We know of 
elements with up to 118 electrons. These elements have their 
outermost electrons in the seventh energy level.
Outer electrons
As we will see in the next chapter, the outermost electrons in an atom 
are the ones that interact with other atoms. The outer electrons are 
the ones in the highest energy level. Electrons in the completely filled 
inner energy levels do not participate in forming chemical bonds.

periodic table correspond to the energy 
levels for the electrons in an atom.

The elements have a wide variety of chemical and physical properties. Some are solid at 
room temperature, like copper. Others are liquid (like bromine) or gas (like oxygen). Some 
solid elements (like zinc) melt at very low temperatures and some melt at very high 
temperatures (like titanium). Chemically, there is an equally wide variety of properties. 
Some elements, like sodium, form salts that dissolve easily in water. Other elements, like 
neon do not form compounds with any other elements.
Room temperature appearance
Most elements
are solid at room
temperature
Most of the pure elements are solid at room temperature. Only 11 of 
the 92 naturally occurring elements are a gas, and 10 of the 11 are 
found on the far right of the periodic table. Only 2 elements (Br and 
Hg) are liquid at room temperature.
What this tells us
about
intermolecular
forces
An element is solid when intermolecular forces are strong enough to 
overcome the thermal motion of atoms. At room temperature, this is 
true for most of the elements. The noble gases and elements to the far 
right of the periodic table are the exception. These elements have 
completely filled or nearly filled energy levels (Figure 7.7). When an 
energy level is completely filled, the electrons do not interact strongly 
with electrons in other atoms, reducing intermolecular forces.
Figure 7.7: The noble gases have 
completely filled energy levels. All of the 
elements which are gas at room 
temperature have filled or nearly filled 
energy levels.

Can you tell which one is periodic?
The top graph shows the energy it takes 
to remove an electron. The bottom graph 
shows the atomic weight.
periodicity - the repeating 
pattern  of chemical and physical 
properties of the elements.
Periodic properties of the elements
The pattern in
melting and
boiling points
We said earlier that the periodic table arranges elements with 
common properties in groups (columns). The diagram below shows 
the melting and boiling points for the first 36 elements. The first 
element in each row always has a low melting point (Li, Na, K). The 
melting (and boiling) points rise toward the center of each row and 
then decrease again. 
Periodicity
The pattern of melting and boiling points is an example of 
periodicity. Periodicity means properties repeat each period (row) of 
the periodic table. Periodicity indicates that a property is strongly 
related to the filling of electron energy levels. Melting points reflect 
the strength of intermolecular forces. The diagram shows that 
intermolecular forces are strongest when energy levels are about half 
full (or half empty). Elements with half filled energy levels have the 
greatest number of electrons that can participate in bonding.

7.2 PROPERTIES OF THE ELEMENTS
CHAPTER 7: ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Thermal and electrical conductivity
Metals are good
electrical
conductors
Electricity is something we often take for 
granted because we use it everyday. 
Fundamentally, electricity is the 
movement of electric charge, usually 
electrons. Some materials allow electrons 
to flow easily through them. If you 
connected a battery and a bulb through 
one of these materials the bulb would light. 
We call these materials electrical 
conductors. Copper and aluminum are excellent electrical 
conductors. Both belong to the family of metals, which are elements in 
the center and left-hand side of the periodic table (Figure 7.9). Copper 
and aluminum are used for almost all electrical wiring.
Metals are good
conductors of
heat
If you hold one end of a copper pipe with 
your hand and heat the other end with the 
torch, your hand will quickly get hot. That 
is because copper is a good conductor of 
heat as well as electricity. Like copper, 
most metals are good thermal 
conductors. That is one reason pots and 
pans are made of metal. Heat from a stove can pass easily through the 
metal walls of a pot to transfer energy to the food inside.
Nonmetals are
typically
insulators
Elements to the far right of the periodic 
table are not good conductors of electricity 
or heatn especially as many are a gas. 
Because they are so different from metals, 
these elements are called non-metals. 
Nonmetals make good insulators. An 
insulator is a material which slows down 
or stops the flow of either heat or 
electricity. Air is a good insulator. Air is 
oxygen, nitrogen and argon.
Figure 7.9: Dividing the periodic 
table up into metals, metalloids, and 
non-metals.
electrical conductor - a 
material that allows electricity to 
flow through easily.
thermal conductor - a material 
that allows heat to flow easily.
insulator - a material that slows 
down or stops the flow of either 
heat or electricity.

Figure 7.10: Nails are made of steel 
which contains 95% iron and 5% 
carbon. Kitchen knives are made of 
stainless steel which is an alloy

mostly from aluminum alloys. 
Aluminum combines high strength and 
light weight.
steel - an alloy of iron and carbon.
Metals and metal alloys
Steel is an alloy
of iron and
carbon
When asked for an example of a metal, many people immediately 
think of steel. Steel is made from iron which is the fourth most 
abundant element in the Earth’s crust. However, steel is not pure 
iron. Steel is an alloy. An alloy is a solid mixture of one or more 
elements. Most metals are used as alloys and not in their pure 
elemental form. Common steel contains mostly iron with a few 
percent of carbon. Stainless steel and high strength steel alloys also 
contain small percentages of other elements such as chromium, 
manganese, and vanadium. More that 500 different types of steel are 
in everyday use (Figure 7.10).
Aluminum is light
Aluminum is a metal widely used for structural applications. 
Aluminum alloys are not quite as strong as steel however aluminum 
has one third the density of steel. Aluminum alloys are used when 
weight is a factor, such as for airplane construction. The frames and 
skins of airplanes are built of aluminum alloys (Figure 7.11).
Titanium is both
strong and light
Titanium combines the strength and 
hardness of steel with the light weight of 
aluminum. Titanium alloys are used for 
military aircraft, racing bicycles, and 
other high performance machines. 
Titanium  is expensive because it is 
somewhat rare and difficult to work with.
Brass
Brass is a hard, gold-colored metal 
alloy. Ordinary (yellow) brass is an 
alloy of 72% copper, 24% zinc, 3% 
lead, and 1% tin. Hinges, door knobs, 
keys and decorative objects are made 
of brass because brass is easy to work 
with. Because it contains lead 
however, you should never eat or 
drink from anything made of 
ordinary (yellow) brass.

149
7.2 PROPERTIES OF THE ELEMENTS
CHAPTER 7: ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Carbon and carbon-like elements
Carbon is an
important
element for life
Carbon represents less than 100th of a percent of the earth’s crust by 
mass, yet it is the element most essential for life on our planet. 
Virtually all the molecules that make up plants and animals are 
constructed around carbon. The chemistry of carbon is so important it 
has its own name, organic chemistry, which is the subject of Chapter 
11 (Figure 7.12).
Diamond and
graphite
Pure carbon is found in nature in two very 
different forms. Graphite is a black solid made 
of carbon that becomes a slippery powder when 
ground up. Graphite is used for lubricating 
locks and keys. Diamond is also pure carbon. 
Diamond is the hardest natural substance 
known and also has the highest thermal 
conductivity of any material. Diamond is so 
strong because every carbon atom in diamond 
is bonded to four neighboring atoms in a 
tetrahedral crystal.
Silicon
Directly under carbon on the periodic table is the element silicon. 
Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth’s crust 
second only to oxygen. Like carbon, silicon has four electrons in its 
outermost energy level. This means silicon can also make bonds with 
four other atoms. Sand, rocks, and minerals are predominantly made 
from silicon and oxygen (Figure 7.13). Most gemstones, such as rubies 
and emeralds, are compounds of silicon and oxygen with traces of 
other elements. In fact, if you can see a  glass window you are looking 
at (or through) pure silica (SiO2). 
Silicon and
semiconductors
Perhaps silicon’s most famous application today is for making 
semiconductors. Virtually every computer chip or electronic device 
uses crystals of very pure silicon (Figure 7.14). The area around San 
Jose, California is known as Silicon Valley because of the electronics 
companies located there. Germanium, the element just below silicon 
on the periodic table is also used for semiconductors.
Figure 7.12: Organic chemistry is 
the chemistry of living organisms and is 
based on the element carbon.
Figure 7.13: Sand and glass are two 
common materials based on silicon.
Figure 7.14: 
Microelectronics 
(the small black 
squares)  are 
constructed on 
crystals of pure 
silicon.

UNIT 3: ATOMS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Figure 7.15: The Earth’s atmosphere 
is predominantly nitrogen and oxygen.
Figure 7.16: Oxygen makes up 46% 
of the mass of Earth’s crust. This 
enormous quantity of oxygen is bound 
up in rocks and minerals.
Nitrogen, Oxygen and Phosphorus
Nitrogen and
oxygen make up
most of the
atmosphere
Nitrogen is a colorless tasteless and odorless gas that makes up 78 
percent of Earth’s atmosphere. Oxygen makes up another 21 percent 
of the atmosphere. Both oxygen and nitrogen gas consist of molecules 
with two atoms (N2, O2). 
Oxygen in rocks
and minerals
Oxygen is only 21 percent of the atmosphere however,  Oxygen is by 
far the most abundant element in Earth’s crust. Almost 46 percent of 
the Earth’s crust is oxygen. Because it is so reactive, all of this oxygen 
is bonded to other elements in rocks and minerals in the form of 
oxides. Silicon dioxide (SiO2), calcium oxide (CaO), aluminum oxide 
(Al2O3), and magnesium oxide (MgO) are common mineral 
compounds. Hematite, an oxide of iron (Fe2O3) is a common ore from 
which iron is extracted.
Liquid nitrogen
With a boiling point of -196°C, liquid nitrogen is used for rapid 
freezing in medical and industrial applications. A common treatment 
for skin warts is to freeze them with liquid nitrogen.
Oxygen and
nitrogen in living
organisms
Oxygen and nitrogen are crucial to living animals and plants. For 
example, proteins and DNA both contain nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of 
a key ecological cycle. Bacteria in soil convert nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
in the soil to complex proteins and amino acids. These nutrients are 
taken up by the roots of plants, and later eaten by animals. Waste 
and dead tissue from animals is recycled by the soil bacteria which 
return the nitrogen to begin a new cycle.
Phosphorus
Directly below nitrogen in the periodic table is 
phosphorus. Phosphorus is a key ingredient of 
DNA, the molecule responsible for carrying the 
genetic code in all living creatures.One of 
phosphorus’ unusual applications is in “glow-in-
the-dark plastic”. When phosphorus atoms 
absorb light, they store energy and give off a 
greenish glow as they slowly re-emit the energy.

laboratory.Which element is this 
and how was it discovered?

152
Naming the Elements
Spend more than a few minutes looking at the periodic table 
and you’ll probably start to wonder who on Earth came up with 
some of the element names. Yttrium, for example. How did 
anyone think that up?
The elements’ chemical symbols are just as confusing. Sure, it’s 
easy to see why O stands for oxygen, but why did they pick W 
for tungsten and K for potassium?
Ancient names
It turns out the history of element 
names is messy and complicated. 
On the one hand, you have 
elements whose existence was 
well-known in many cultures 
long before the periodic table was 
developed. Gold is a good 
example. There are hundreds of 
names, both ancient and modern, 
for this element. The English 
word gold comes from the 
German word for yellow. The 
element’s symbol, Au, comes from 
the Latin word for yellow, aurum.
Modern names
On the other hand, you have 
elements that have yet to be 
discovered (or synthesized in a lab). The naming system for 
these is based on their number in the periodic table. Take 
element number 118, for example. It’s called ununoctium. In 
English, that translates to “one-one-eight-ium.” Using the table 
below, can you name element 114?

UNIT 3 ATOMS AND THE  PERIODIC TABLE
The names in between
In between the ancient and the undiscovered elements is a long 
list of elements that were identified, for the most part, between 
1600 and 1970. Some of these elements are named for places. 
Yttrium, for example, is named for Ytterby, a feldspar quarry 
near Stockholm, Sweden. Yttrium was first isolated from 
Ytterby rocks.
Some of the elements’ names are descriptive. Chlorine (from 
khloros, for yellow-green), iodine (from ioeides, for violet) and 
rhodium (from rhodon, for rose) are names derived from the 
Greek word for the element’s color. 
The glow-in-the-dark element phosphorus’ name means “light 
bearing” in Greek. The name 
hydrogen means “water 
producing.” It was 
suggested by Antoine 
Lavoisier because when 
hydrogen burns, water is 
produced.
One descriptive name 
reflects an unpleasant 
characteristic: The 
element name osmium is 
taken from the Greek 
word osme, which means 
“odor.” The element got 
its name because one of 
its common compounds, 
OsO4, smells terrible!
Official naming rights
Since 1949, the International Union for Pure and Applied 
Chemistry (IUPAC), based in Oxford, England, has been 
responsible for the international names for the elements. These 
names are used when chemicals are sold from one country to 
another. However, countries can use their own names within 
their borders—and many countries do, especially those that do 
not use the English alphabet in their native language.
When a new element is identified, the discoverers are awarded 
the privilege of proposing a name. This is not always a 
straightforward process, since some of the heaviest elements 
exist for only fractions of a second. When several labs in 
different parts of the world are working on similar projects, it 
can be difficult to determine who should get credit for being 
first.
However, the elements up through element 109, meitnerium, 
now have official IUPAC names. Some of these names you will 
recognize as familiar figures from your study of modern 
physics. Others, like hassium and dubnium, are named after 
places where the elements were synthesized. Perhaps in your 
lifetime you will have a hand in naming a new element!
Questions: 
1. Take a look at the periodic table. How many elements can 
you find that are named after scientists you have studied?
2. The names for cerium and palladium have something in 
common. Use a library or the internet to find out the origin 
of these names and explain their relationship
3. Three competing groups proposed names for elements 
104 to 108. Find out who they were and how the IUPAC 
finally resolved the controversy in 1997.
Chapter 7 Connection

154
Name That Element
Each element on the periodic table 
has a chemical symbol that is an 
abbreviation of the element’s name. 
Unlike the abbreviations for a U.S. 
state, these symbol-abbreviations are 
not always obvious. Many are 
derived from the element’s name in a 
language such as Latin or German. 
The chemical symbol for silver is 
“Ag”. Note that the first letter in the 
symbol is upper case and the second 
is lower case. Writing symbols this 
way allows us to represent all of the 
elements without getting confused. There is a big difference 
between the element cobalt, with its symbol Co, and the 
compound carbon monoxide, written as CO. In this activity, 
you’ll make a set of flashcards for 30 elements and then play 
a game to see who in your class knows their elements. 
Materials:
30 blank 8 × 10 cards and markers
What you will do
1.
Each person in the class writes the symbol of one of the
elements from the list on one of the large cards. Make
sure you write the chemical symbol large enough so you
can see it all the way across the classroom. The elements
suggested below are some of the most common elements.
2.
The teacher collects all the cards and stands in front of
the class.
3.
The first two players stand next to each other. The
teacher holds up a chemical symbol card and the first
player to correctly give the name of the element moves
on to the next player. The player who didn’t answer sits
down.
4.
The game goes all the way around the classroom, with
the player who names the element moving on and the
other player sitting down.
5.
The player who is left standing at the end of the game is
the winner.
Applying your knowledge
a. Find the element whose chemical symbol comes from the 
Latin word aurum which means “shining dawn”.
b. What word does the chemical symbol for lead, Pb, come 
from?
c. Find the element whose chemical symbol comes from the 
Latin word natrium?
d. Which element comes from the Latin word for coal?
e. Another game to play is to see who can come up with the 
longest word spelled completely with chemical symbols.  
Some examples are life, from lithium (Li) and iron (Fe), 
and brook, from bromine (Br), oxygen (O), and potassium 
(K).

Figure 8.1: “Pure” sugar is a 
compound made up of two chemically 
bonded simple sugars: glucose and 
fructose.
compound - a substance whose 
smallest particles include more 
than one element chemically

water (H2O) is a compound of 
hydrogen and oxygen atoms 
bonded together.
mixture - a substance that 
includes more than one type of 
element and/or compound.
8.1 Compounds and Chemical Bonds
Most matter is in the form of compounds. If a substance is made of a pure element, 
chances are it will eventually combine with other elements to make a compound. For 
example, water, H2O, is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The iron in a 
nail combines with oxygen in water or air to make a compound called iron oxide, better 
known as rust. This chapter is about how and why atoms combine into compounds.
Most matter is in the form of compounds and mixtures
Compounds and
mixtures
A compound contains two or more different elements that are 
chemically bonded together. For example, water (H2O) is a compound 
of hydrogen and oxygen atoms bonded together. A mixture contains 
two or more elements and/or compounds that are not chemically 
bonded together. The atmosphere is a mixture of  oxygen and 
nitrogen but not a compound. Nitrous oxide (N2O), is a compound 
because oxygen and nitrogen atoms are bonded together in a 
molecule.
Salt and sugar
are compounds
Virtually everything you eat and everything in your kitchen is a 
compound. Salt is a compound of sodium and chlorine. Sugar is a 
compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Animal and vegetable 
material are made of even more complex compounds, such as proteins 
and fats which may consist of hundreds or thousands of atoms.

fructose tastes much sweeter than glucose. There are thousands of 
different compounds in a single sample of animal or vegetable tissue.

8.1 COMPOUNDS AND CHEMICAL BONDS
CHAPTER 8: MOLECULES AND COMPOUNDS
Molecules and covalent bonds
Electrons form
chemical bonds
A chemical bond forms when atoms transfer or share electrons. Two 
atoms that are sharing one or more electrons are chemically bonded 
and move together. In a water molecule, each hydrogen atom shares 
its single electron with the oxygen atom at the center (Figure 8.2). 
Almost all the elements form chemical bonds easily. This is why most 
of the matter you experience is in the form of compounds.
A chemical bond forms when atoms transfer 
or share electrons.
Covalent bonds
A covalent bond is formed when atoms share electrons. The bonds 
between oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule are covalent bonds 
(Figure 8.2). There are two covalent bonds in a water molecule, 
between the oxygen and each of the hydrogen atoms. Each bond 
represents one electron. In a covalent bond, electrons are shared 
between atoms, not transferred. 
Molecules
A group of atoms held together by covalent bonds is called a molecule. 
Water is a molecule, and so is each of the different sugar molecules on 
the previous page. Other examples of molecules are methane (CH4), 
ammonia (NH3), oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2). In the case of oxygen 
and nitrogen, the bond between atoms is a double or triple covalent 
bond. A double bond involves two electrons and a triple bond involves 
three electrons per atom.

shared electrons act like ties that hold a 
molecule together.

structural diagrams.
chemical formula - identifies the 
number and element of each type 
of atom in a compound. For 
example, the chemical formula 
Fe2O3 is for a compound with iron 
(Fe) and oxygen (O) in a ratio of 2 
iron atoms for every 3 oxygen 
atoms. 
Chemical formulas and diagrams
The chemical
formula
Molecules are represented by a chemical formula. The chemical 
formula tells you the precise number of each kind of atom in the 
molecule. For example, the chemical formula for water is H2O. The 
subscript 2 indicates there are two hydrogen atoms in the molecule. 
The chemical formula also tells you that water always contains twice 
as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms. This is important to know 
if you wish to make water from elemental oxygen and hydrogen.
The shape of a molecule is also  important to its function and 
properties. For this reason, molecules are represented by structural 
diagrams which show the shape and arrangement of atoms. Single 
bonds between atoms are indicated by solid lines connecting the 
element symbols. Double and triple bonds are indicated by double 
and triple lines. Both the chemical formula and structural diagrams 
are shown in Figure 8.3. 
Of course, real molecules are three-
dimensional, not flat as shown in 
the structural diagram. For 
example a methane molecule has 
the shape of a 4-sided pyramid 
called a tetrahedron. Each 
hydrogen atom is at a corner of the 
tetrahedron and the carbon atom is 
at the center.

CHAPTER 8: MOLECULES AND COMPOUNDS
Structure and function
Properties come
from the
molecule
The properties of a compound depend much more on the exact 
composition and structure (shape) of its molecule than on the elements 
of which it is made. As a good example, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is 
made from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen according to the chemical 
formula H8C9O4 (Figure 8.4). This compound has the property of 
relieving swelling and reducing pain in humans.
Properties
depend on the
exact chemical
formula
By themselves, the elements (H, C, O) do not have the property of 
reducing pain. Other molecules formed from the same elements have 
very different properties than aspirin. For example, polyethylene 
plastic wrap and formaldehyde (a toxic preservative) are also made 
from carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The beneficial properties of 
aspirin come from the specific combination of exactly 8 hydrogen, 9 
carbon, and 4 oxygen atoms. If the ratio of elements was changed, for 
example removing even one hydrogen, the resulting molecule would 
not have the properties of aspirin.
Properties also
depend on
molecular
structure
The structure of a molecule is also important to the properties of a 
compound. The same 21 atoms in aspirin can be combined in other 
structures with the same chemical formula! The resulting molecules 
are something completely different (diagram above) and do not have 
the beneficial properties of aspirin. Both chemical formula and 
structure determine the properties of a compound. 
Figure 8.4: An aspirin molecule.
Like many modern medicines, the 
active ingredient in aspirin was 
first discovered in nature. In fact, 
aspirin’s pain-relieving properties 
were known and used in its natural 
form long before scientists learned 
of it. Research the discovery of 
aspirin to find out the intriguing 
story of this widely-used medicine.

UNIT 3: ATOMS AND THE PERIODIC TABLE
Figure 8.5: Sodium chloride is an 
ionic compound in which each positive 
sodium ion is attracted to all of its 
negative chloride neighbors and vice 
versa.
ion - an atom that has an electric 
charge different from zero. Ions 
are created when atoms gain or 
lose electrons.
ionic bond - a bond that 
transfers an electron from one 
atom to another resulting in 
attraction between oppositely 
charged ions.
Ionic compounds
An ion is a
charged atom
Not all compounds are made of molecules. For example, sodium 
chloride (NaCl) is a compound of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) in a 
ratio of one sodium atom per chlorine atom. The difference is that in 
sodium chloride, the electron is essentially transferred from the 
sodium atom to the chlorine atom. When atoms gain or lose an 
electron they become ions. An ion is a charged atom. By losing an 
electron, the sodium atom becomes a sodium ion with a charge of +1. 
By gaining an electron, the chlorine atom becomes a chloride ion with 
a charge of -1 (when chlorine becomes an ion, the name changes to 
chloride).
Ionic bonds
Sodium and chlorine form an ionic bond because the positive sodium 
ion is attracted to the negative chloride ion. Ionic bonds are bonds in 
which electrons are transferred from one atom to another.
Ionic compounds
do not form
molecules
Ionic bonds are not limited to a single pair of atoms like covalent 
bonds. In sodium chloride each positive sodium ion is attracted to all 
of the neighboring chloride ions (Figure 8.5). Likewise, each chloride 
ion is attracted to all the neighboring sodium atoms. Because the 
bonds are not just between pairs of atoms, ionic compounds do not 
form molecules! In an ionic compound, each atom bonds with all of its  
neighbors through attraction between positive and negative charge.
The chemical
formula for ionic
compounds
Like molecular compounds, ionic compounds also have fixed ratios of 
elements. For example, there is one sodium ion per chloride ion in 
sodium chloride. This means we can use the same type of chemical 
formula for ionic compounds and molecular compounds.
Ions may be
multiply charged
Sodium chloride involves the transfer of one electron however, ionic 
compounds may also be formed by the transfer of two or more 
electrons. A good example is magnesium chloride (MgCl2). The 
magnesium atom gives up two electrons to become a magnesium ion 
with a charge of +2 (Mg2+). Each chlorine atom gains one electron to 
become a chloride ion with a charge of -1 (Cl-). The ion charge is 
written as a superscript after the element (Mg2+, Fe3+,Cl-, etc.).

163
8.1 COMPOUNDS AND CHEMICAL BONDS
CHAPTER 8: MOLECULES AND COMPOUNDS
Why chemical bonds form
Atoms form
bonds to reach a
lower energy
state
Imagine pulling tape off a surface. It takes energy to separate atoms 
that are bonded together just like it takes energy to pull tape off a 
surface. If it takes energy to separate bonded atoms, then the same 
energy must be released when the bond is formed. Energy is released 
when chemical bonds form. Energy is released because chemically 
bonded atoms have less total energy than free atoms. Like a ball 
rolling downhill, atoms form compounds because the atoms have lower 
energy when they are together in compounds. For example, one carbon 
atom and four hydrogen atoms have more total energy apart than they 
do when combined in a methane molecule (Figure 8.6).
Chemical
reactivity
All elements except the noble gases form chemical bonds. However, 
some elements are much more reactive than others. In chemistry, 
“reactive” means an element readily forms chemical bonds, often 
releasing energy. For example, sodium is a highly reactive metal. 
Chlorine is a highly reactive gas. If pure sodium and pure chlorine are 
placed together, a violent explosion occurs as the sodium and chlorine 
combine and form ionic bonds. The energy of the explosion is the 
energy given off by the formation of the chemical bonds.
Some elements
are more reactive
than others
The closer an element is to having the same number of electrons as a 
noble gas, the more reactive the element is. The alkali metals are very 
reactive because they are just one electron away from the noble 
gasses. The halogens are also very reactive because they are also one 
electron away from the noble gases. The beryllium group and the 
oxygen group are less reactive because each element in these groups is 
two electrons away from a noble gas.
Figure 8.6: The methane (CH4) 
molecule has lower total energy than 
four separate hydrogen and one 
separate carbon atom.
The noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, ...) 
are called inert because they do 
not ordinarily react with anything. 
You can put sodium in an 
atmosphere of pure helium and 
nothing will happen. However, 
scientists have found that a few 
noble gases DO form compounds 
in very special circumstances. 
Research the topic and see if you 
can find a compound involving a 
noble gas.

8.2 ELECTRONS AND CHEMICAL BONDS
CHAPTER 8: MOLECULES AND COMPOUNDS
8.2 Electrons and Chemical Bonds
The discovery of energy levels in the atom solved a 2000-year-old mystery. The mystery 
was why elements combined with other elements only in particular ratios (or not at all). 
For example, why do two hydrogen atoms bond with one oxygen to make water? Why isn’t 
there a molecule with three (H3O) or even four (H4O) hydrogen atoms? Why does sodium 
chloride have a precise ratio of one sodium ion to one chloride ion? Why do helium, neon, 
and argon form no compounds with any other element?  The answer has to do with energy 
levels and electrons.
Valence electrons
Valence electrons
Chemical bonds are formed only between the electrons in the highest 
unfilled energy level. These electrons are called valence electrons. 
You can think of valence electrons as the outer “skin” of an atom. 
Electrons in the inner (filled) energy levels do not “see” other atoms 
because they are shielded by the valence electrons. For example, 
chlorine has 7 valence electrons. The first 10 of chlorine’s 17 electrons 
are in the inner (filled) energy levels.
Most elements
bond to reach 8
valence electrons
It turns out that 8 is a magic number for chemical bonding. All the 
elements heavier than boron form chemical bonds to try and get to a 
configuration with eight valence electrons (Figure 8.10). Eight is a 
preferred number because 8 electrons are a complete (filled) energy 
level.  The noble gases already have a magic number of 8 valence 
electrons. They don’t form chemical bonds because they don’t need to!
Light elements
bond to reach 2
valance electrons
For elements with atomic number 5 (boron) or less, the magic number 
is 2 instead of 8. For these light elements, 2 valence electrons 
completely fills the first energy level. The elements H, He, Li, Be,and 
B, form bonds to reach the magic number of 2. 
Hydrogen is
special
Because of its single electron, hydrogen can also have 0 valence 
electrons! Zero is a magic number for hydrogen, as well as 2. This 
flexibility makes hydrogen a very “friendly” element; hydrogen can 
bond with almost any other element.
Figure 8.9: Chlorine has 7 valence 
electrons. The other 10 electrons are in 
filled (inner) energy levels.
Figure 8.10: Chlorine and sodium 
bond so each can reach a configuration 
with 8 valence electrons.

beryllium oxide (BeO).

Valence electrons and the periodic table
Period 2
elements
The picture below shows how the electrons in the elements in the 
second period (lithium to neon) fill the energy levels. Two of lithium’s 
three electrons go in the first energy level. Lithium has one valence 
electron because it’s third electron is the only one in the second 
energy level.
Each successive
element has one
more valence
electron
Going from left to right across a period each successive element has 
one more valence electron. Beryllium has two valence electrons. 
Boron has three and carbon has four. Each element in the second 
period adds one more electron until all 8 spots in the second energy 
level are full at atomic number 10, which is neon, a noble gas. Neon 
has 8 valence electrons 
Bonding
Oxygen has 6 valence electrons. To get to the magic number of 8, 
oxygen needs to add two electrons. Oxygen forms chemical bonds that 
provide these two extra electrons. For example, a single oxygen atom 
combines with two hydrogen atoms because each hydrogen can 
supply only one electron. Oxygen combines with one beryllium atom 
because beryllium can supply two valence electrons to give oxygen its 
required number of 8 (Figure 8.11).
Double bonds
share 2 electrons
Carbon has four valence electrons. That means two oxygen atoms can 
bond with a single carbon atom, each oxygen sharing two of carbon’s 
four valence electrons. The bonds in carbon dioxide (CO2) are double 
bonds because each bond involves 2 electrons (Figure 8.12).

Lewis dot diagrams
Dot diagrams of
the elements
A clever way to keep track of valence electrons is to draw Lewis dot 
diagrams. A dot diagram  shows the element symbol surrounded by 
one to eight dots representing the valence electrons. Each dot 
represents one electron. Lithium has one dot, beryllium has two, 
nitrogen has three, etc. Figure 8.13 shows the dot diagrams for the 
first 10 elements.
Dot diagrams of
molecules
Each element forms bonds to reach one of the magic numbers of  
valence electrons: 2 or 8. In dot diagrams of a complete molecule each 
element symbol has either 2 or 8 dots around it. Both configurations  
correspond to completely filled (or empty) energy levels.
Example dot
diagrams
Carbon has four dots and hydrogen has one. One carbon atom bonds 
with four hydrogen atoms because this allows the carbon atom to have 
eight valence electrons (8 dots) — four of its own and four shared from 
the hydrogen atoms. The picture above shows dot diagrams for carbon 
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and carbon 
tetrachloride (CCl4), a flammable solvent.

Oxidation numbers
Oxidation
numbers
A sodium atom always ionizes to become Na+ (a charge of +1) when it 
combines with other atoms to make a compound. Therefore, we say 
that sodium has an oxidation number of 1+. An oxidation number 
indicates the charge on the remaining atom (ion) when electrons are 
lost, gained, or shared in chemical bonds. Table 8.1 shows the 
oxidation numbers for some elements. Notice that the convention for 
writing oxidation numbers is the opposite of the convention for 
writing the charge. When writing the oxidation number, the positive 
(or negative) symbol is written after the number, not before it.
Oxidation
numbers and the
periodic table
Oxidation numbers correspond closely to an element’s group on the 
periodic table. All of the alkali metals have oxidation numbers of 1+ 
since these elements all prefer to lose one electron in chemical bonds. 
All of the halogens have an oxidation number of 1- because these 
elements prefer to gain an electron in chemical bonds. The diagram 
below shows the trend in oxidation numbers across the periodic table. 
Most transition metals have complicated oxidation numbers because 
they have many more electrons.

8.2 ELECTRONS AND CHEMICAL BONDS
CHAPTER 8: MOLECULES AND COMPOUNDS
Predicting a chemical formula
Oxidation
numbers in a
compound add
up to zero
When elements combine in molecules and ionic compounds, the total 
electric charge is always zero. This is because any electron donated by 
one atom is accepted by another. The rule of zero charge is easiest to 
apply using oxidation numbers. The total of all the oxidation numbers 
for all the atoms in a compound must be zero. This important rule 
allows you to predict many chemical formulas.
The oxidation numbers for all the atoms in a 
compound must add up to zero
Example, carbon
tetrachloride
To see how this works, consider the compound, carbon tetrachloride 
(CCl4). Carbon has an oxidation number of 4+. Chlorine has an 
oxidation number of 1-. It takes four chlorine atoms to cancel with 
carbon’s 4+ oxidation number.
Predict a

a. Predict the chemical formula of the compound containing beryllium (2+) and fluorine (1-). Answer: BeF2
Multiple oxidation numbers
Many periodic tables list multiple 
oxidation numbers for most 
elements.  This is because more 
complex bonding is possible. This 
course gives you the fundamental 
ideas but there is much more! 
When multiple 
oxidation numbers 
are shown, the 
most common one 
is usually in bold 
type. For example, 
nitrogen has 
possible oxidation 
numbers of 5+, 4+, 
3+, 2+ and 3- even though 3- is the 
most common.

b. Is calcium fluoride (CaF2) likely to

Answer: ionic
Ionic and covalent bonds
Why bonds are
ionic or covalent
Whether or not a compound is ionic or covalently bonded depends on 
how much each element “needs” an electron to get to a magic number 
(2 or 8). Elements which are very close to the noble gases tend to give 
or take electrons rather than share them. These elements often form 
ionic bonds rather than covalent bonds. 
Sodium chloride
is ionic
As an example, sodium has one electron more than the noble gas, 
neon. Sodium has a very strong tendency to give up that electron and 
become a positive ion. Chlorine has one electron less than argon. 
Therefore, chlorine has a very strong tendency to accept an electron 
and become a negative ion. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound 
because sodium has a strong tendency to give up an electron and 
chlorine has a strong tendency to accept an electron.
Widely separated
elements form
ionic compounds
On the periodic table, strong electron donors are the left side (alkali 
metals). Strong electron acceptors are on the right side (halogens). 
The farther separated two elements are on the periodic table, the 
more likely they are to form an ionic compound.
Nearby elements
form covalent
compounds
Covalent compounds form when elements have roughly equal 
tendency to accept electrons. Elements that are nonmetals and 
therefore close together on the periodic table tend to form covalent 
compounds with each other because they have approximately equal 
tendency to accept electrons. Compounds involving carbon, silicon, 
nitrogen, and oxygen are often covalent.

Salt: Common, But Uncommonly Important
Timbuktu sounds like a faraway place, isolated, inaccessible - 
almost imaginary. In fact, it is in a remote location: at the edge 
of the Sahara in the West African nation of Mali. And today, 
Timbuktu is a ruined city, a harsh place under constant threat 
from desert sand and winds. It is hard to picture it as it once 
was - a thriving center of trade and culture. What could this old 
city have in common with salt? 
Beginning more than 900 years ago, Timbuktu became an 
important crossroads of African trade. Caravans of thousands 
of camels crossed hundreds of miles of desert to and from the 
city. Two commodities, which often traded at equal value and 
were used as money, drove the city’s fortunes: gold and salt. 
Today salt is among the most common substances we know. 
Why was it so valuable back then, literally worth its weight in 
gold? There were two big reasons. First, salt was much harder 
to find than it is today. Second, it was very important for 
preserving foods. Before refrigeration, salt was used to keep 
meat edible for long periods of time. The use of salt as a 
preservative contributed to the survival and expansion of 
human civilization.
Salt in the modern world 
Today, salt is still important, but not as a food preservative. Of 
course, it is commonly used to season food. It is also used as a 
supplement in raising livestock and poultry. Salt has many 
industrial uses, too, in making paper, soap, detergent, and a 
variety of chemicals. In many parts of the United States, huge 
amounts of salt are used to melt ice on highways in winter.
One of the chief ways to get salt is to mine it. Rock salt, also 
called halite, is mined from salt deposits which are usually deep 
in the ground. A mammoth salt deposit lies beneath portions of 
Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, and 
Ontario, Canada. This Great Eastern Salt Basin is one of the 
largest salt beds in the world. The salt was evaporated from 
ancient seas and deposited more than 300 million years ago. 
Today, in Cleveland, Ohio, this salt is mined from beneath Lake 
Erie. The salt mine is immense; its two main shafts are nearly 
2,000 feet deep.
The other common way to get salt is through evaporation. In 
the evaporation process, salt is gathered from seawater, salt 
marshes, or salt lakes. San Francisco Bay in California has one 
of the largest salt operations in the country; it is scooped from 
the bottom of coastal ponds. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is 
another huge evaporation site.

UNIT 3 ATOMS AND THE  PERIODIC TABLE
The chemistry of salt
Salt is a chemical compound composed of two elements, sodium 
and chlorine. It is called sodium chloride. The chemical symbol 
for salt is NaCl. A salt crystal contains one atom of sodium for 
each atom of chlorine. 
Let’s take a closer look at these elements. Sodium is on the left 
side of the periodic table of elements, a metal. Its atomic 
number is 11. It is soft, light, and silvery-white. Sodium is 
highly reactive and never found in pure form in nature. It 
oxidizes in air and reacts violently with water. 
Chlorine is on the right side of the periodic table, a halogen. Its 
atomic number is 17. It is yellow-green in color and poisonous. 
Chlorine is commonly found in nature as a gas. In liquid form it 
is a powerful oxidizing and bleaching agent; it is a component of 
chlorine bleach. Chlorine combines easily with nearly all other 
elements. 
Sodium chloride is a crystal. The particular crystal structure of 
sodium chloride is cubic. Each sodium ion is surrounded by six 
chlorine ions. Each chlorine ion is surrounded by six sodium 
ions. This is known as the halite structure and is common to 
many minerals.
“The salt of the Earth” is precious
Sodium chloride is one of Earth’s most common compounds. It 
makes the oceans salty; it is found in most human tissue; it is 
plainly essential to life.
Yet long ago, salt was one of the most valuable substances in 
the world. Having it was as good as money in the bank. Wars 
were fought over salt. We take common table salt for granted 
now, but salt has been uncommonly important to human 
civilization and to life here on Earth.

Molecular Gumdrop Models
Molecules are the structures that result when two or more 
atoms bond by sharing electrons. In living things, almost all 
molecules are made from hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, 
oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Molecules are described 
using formulas. For example, H2 is a molecule consisting of 
two hydrogen atoms. CH4 is a molecule consisting of one 
carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. In this activity, you 
will build some simple molecules out of gumdrops and 
toothpicks.
Materials:
Toothpicks
White, red, yellow and green gumdrops
What you will do 
1. Colored gumdrops will represent the atoms you use to 
build your molecules: white (or brown) gumdrops 
represent nitrogen, red gumdrops represent carbon, 
yellow gumdrops represent hydrogen, and green 
gumdrops represent oxygen. Toothpicks will represent 
each bond in your model. Remember that hydrogen can 
have one bond, oxygen can have two bonds, carbon can 
make four bonds and nitrogen can have three bonds. The 
bonding between two atoms can be single, double or 
triple. So, carbon could make its four bonds with four 
single bonds, or two double bonds, or one double bond and 
two single bonds, or one single bond and one triple bond.
2. Build the following molecules. As you build your 
molecules, try to make sure each atom is as far from other 
atoms as possible. If a molecule has three hydrogen 
atoms on it, don’t put all three next to each other. Space

Acids, Bases, and Solutions
Water is essential to all living things on Earth. Consider your 
body for example - it is about 65% water by weight. For every 
hour of vigorous exercise, you may lose as much as a half-gallon 
of your body’s water supply through sweating and exhaling! You 
also lose small amounts of salts when you sweat. If the lost 
water and dissolved salts are not replaced, eventually your body 
will stop functioning. You can replace lost fluid by drinking 
water. To quickly replace salts, many athletes consume sports 
drinks. Why is water such an important substance for living 
creatures? 
Sweat and sports drinks are both examples of solutions – they 
are mostly water with dissolved substances. In this chapter, you 
will learn about solutions. You will also learn about some special 
solutions called acids and bases. Among other things, acids 
create the bitter taste in food and can dissolve some rocks. Bases 
are slippery, like soap. Both acids and bases play a key role in 
maintaining your body’s internal chemical balance.

9.1 Water and solutions
Water is one substance that makes our planet unique. All life on Earth depends on this 
useful combination of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. In our solar system, only Earth has 
liquid water in such great abundance. Because we seem to have so much water, it is easy 
to take it for granted. Think about what you did yesterday. How often did you use water 
and how much? Now think about how yesterday would have been different if you didn’t 
have fresh water!
Examples of solutions
A solution is
homogeneous at
the molecular
level
A solution is a mixture of two or more substances that is uniform at 
the molecular level. Uniform means there are no clumps bigger than 
a molecule and the solution has the same ingredients everywhere. 
Grape soda is a solution you have probably consumed. All the 
particles in grape soda, from the flavor molecules to the color 
molecules, are evenly dispersed throughout the bottle (Figure 9.1).
An alloy is
a solution of two
or more solids
Although we often think of solutions as mixtures of solids in liquids, 
solutions exist in every phase; solid, liquid, or gas. Solutions of two or 
more solids are called alloys. Steel is an alloy (solution) of iron and 
carbon. Fourteen-karat gold is an alloy of silver and gold. “Fourteen-
karat” means that 14 out of every 24 atoms in the alloy are gold 
atoms and the rest are silver atoms.
Muddy water is not a 
solution. Particles of soil 
are small, but still 
contain thousands of 
atoms and molecules. A 
true solution contains 
only individual molecules 
which are not clumped 
together into larger 
particles.

9.1 WATER AND SOLUTIONS
CHAPTER 9: ACIDS, BASES, AND SOLUTIONS
Solvents and solutes
Solvent and
solute
A solution contains at least two components: a solvent, and a solute. 
The solvent is the part of a mixture that is present in the greatest 
amount. For example, the solvent in grape soda is water. The 
remaining parts of a solution (other than the solvent) are called 
solutes. Sugar, coloring dyes, flavoring chemicals, and carbon dioxide 
gas are solutes in grape soda.
Dissolving
When the solute particles are evenly distributed throughout the 
solvent, we say that the solute has dissolved. The picture shows a 
sugar and water solution being prepared. The solute (sugar) starts as 
a solid in the graduated cylinder on the left. Water is added and the 
mixture is carefully stirred until all the solid sugar has dissolved. 
Once the sugar has dissolved the solution is clear again.
The molecular
explanation for
dissolving
On the molecular level, dissolving of a solid (like sugar) occurs when 
molecules of solvent interact with and separate molecules of solute 
(Figure 9.2). Most of the time, substances dissolve faster at higher 
temperatures. This is because higher temperature molecules have 
more energy and are more effective at knocking off molecules of solute. 
You may have noticed that sugar dissolves much faster in hot water 
than in cold water.
Why solutes are
ground up into
powder
Dissolving can only occur where the solvent can touch the solute. Most 
things that are meant to be dissolved, like salt and sugar, are ground 
up to a powder to increase the surface area. Increased surface area 
speeds dissolving because more solute is exposed to the solvent.
Figure 9.2: The molecular 
explanation for a solid dissolving in a 
liquid. Molecules of solvent interact 
with and carry away molecules of solute.
solvent - the component of a 
solution that is present in the 
greatest amount
solute - any component of a 
solution other than the solvent
dissolve - to separate and 
disperse a solid into individual 
molecules or ions in the presence 
of a solvent.

grams of sugar can be dissolved in 
100 milliliters of water at 25°C.

Solubility
What is
solubility?
The term solubility means the amount of solute (if any) that can be 
dissolved in a volume of solvent. Solubility is often listed in grams per 
100 milliliters of solvent. Solubility is always given at a specific 
temperature since temperature strongly affects solubility. For 
example, Table 9.1 tells you that 200 grams of sugar can be dissolved 
in 100 milliliters of water at 25°C. 
Insoluble
substances do
not dissolve
Notice in Table 9.1 that chalk and talc do not have solubility values. 
These substances are insoluble in water because they do not dissolve 
in water. You can mix chalk dust and water and stir them all you 
want but you will still just have a mixture of chalk dust and water. 
The water will not separate the chalk dust into individual molecules 
because chalk does not dissolve in water.
Saturation
Suppose you add 300 grams of sugar to 100 milliliters of water at 
25°C? What happens? According to Table 9.1, 200 grams will dissolve 
in the water. The rest will remain solid. That means you will be left 
with 100 grams of solid sugar at the bottom of your solution. Any 
solute added in excess of the solubility does not dissolve. A solution is 
saturated if it contains as much solute as the solvent can dissolve. 
Dissolving 200 grams of sugar in 100 milliliters of water creates a 
saturated solution because no more sugar will dissolve.
How much salt 
will dissolve in 
water?
Seawater is a solution of water, salt and other minerals. How much salt can 
dissolve in 200 milliliters of water at 25°C?
1. Looking for:
Grams of solute (salt)
2. Given:
Volume (200 ml) and temperature of solvent
3. Relationships:
37.7 grams of salt dissolves in 100 milliliters of water at  
25°C (Table 9.1)
4. Solution:
If 37.7 grams dissolves in 100 milliliters then twice as 
much, or 75.4 grams will dissolve in 200 milliliters.

Concentration
How do you
express solution
concentration?
In chemistry, it is important to know the exact concentration of a 
solution—that is the exact amount of solute dissolved in a given 
amount of solvent. The mass-percent is an accurate way to describe 
concentration. The concentration of a solvent in mass-percent is the 
mass of the solute divided by the total mass of the solution.
Mass percent
example
Suppose you dissolve 10.0 grams of sugar in 90.0 grams of water. 
What is the mass percent of sugar in the solution (Figure 9.3)?
Describing very
low
concentrations
Parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), and parts per trillion 
(ppt) are commonly used to describe very small concentrations of 
pollutants in the environment.  These terms are measures of the ratio 
(by mass) of one material in a much larger amount of another 
material. For example, a pinch (gram) of salt in 10 tons of potato chips 
is about 1 g salt per billion g chips, or a concentration of 1 ppb.

solution of sugar in water.
equilibrium - occurs when a 
solution has the maximum 
concentration of dissolved solute; 
the dissolving rate equals the rate 
at which molecules come out of 
solution (un-dissolve).
supersaturated - a 
concentration greater than the 
maximum solubility.
Equilibrium and supersaturation
Dissolving and
un-dissolving
When a solute like sugar is mixed with a solvent like water, two 
processes are actually going on continuously.
• Molecules of solute dissolve and go into solution
• Molecules of solute come out of solution and become “un-dissolved”
When the concentration is lower than the solubility, the dissolving 
process puts molecules into solution faster than they come out. The 
concentration increases and the mass of un-dissolved solute 
decreases. However, dissolving and un-dissolving are still going on!
Equilibrium
concentration
The more molecules that are in solution (higher concentration) the 
faster molecules come out of solution. As the concentration increases, 
the un-dissolving process also gets faster until the dissolving and un-
dissolving rates are exactly equal. When the rate of dissolving equals 
the rate of coming out of solution, we say equilibrium has been 
reached. At equilibrium, a solution is saturated because the 
concentration is as high as it can go.
Supersaturation
According to the solubility table in Figure 9.4, at 80°C, 100 g of water 
reaches  equilibrium with 360 grams of dissolved sugar. At lower 
temperatures, less sugar can dissolve. What happens if we cool the 
saturated solution? As the temperature goes down, sugar’s solubility 
also goes down and the solution becomes supersaturated. A 
supersaturated solution means there is more dissolved solute than 
the maximum solubility.
Growing crystals
A supersaturated solution is unstable. The 
excess solute comes out of solution and 
returns to its un-dissolved state. This is 
how the large sugar crystals of rock candy 
are made. Sugar is added to boiling water 
until the solution is saturated. As the 
solution cools, it becomes supersaturated. 
Solid sugar crystals form as the sugar comes out of the 
supersaturated solution.

9.1 WATER AND SOLUTIONS
CHAPTER 9: ACIDS, BASES, AND SOLUTIONS
The solubility of gases and liquids
Gas dissolves in
water
Gases can also dissolve in liquids. When you 
drink carbonated soda, the fizz comes from 
dissolved carbon dioxide gas (CO2). Table 9.2 
lists the solubility of CO2 as 1.74 grams per 
kilogram of water at room temperature and 
atmospheric pressure (1 atm). 
Solubility of gas
increases with
pressure
The solubility of gases in liquids increases with pressure.  Soda is fizzy 
because the carbon dioxide was dissolved in the liquid at high 
pressure. When you pop the tab on a can of soda, you release the 
pressure. The solution immediately becomes supersaturated, causing 
the CO2 to bubble out of the water and fizz.
Dissolved
oxygen
Table 9.2 also shows that 0.04 grams of oxygen dissolves in a kilogram 
of water. Dissolved oxygen keeps fish and other underwater animals 
alive (Figure 9.5). Just like on land, oxygen is produced by underwater 
plants as a by-product of photosynthesis. 
Solubility of gas
decreases with
temperature
When temperature goes up, the solubility of gases in liquid goes down 
(Figure 9.6). When the water temperature rises, the amount of 
dissolved oxygen decreases. Less dissolved oxygen means less oxygen 
for fish. When the weather is warm, fish stay near the bottom of ponds 
and rivers where there is cooler, more oxygenated water.
Solubility of
liquids
Some liquids, such as alcohol, are 
soluble in water. Other liquids, such 
as corn oil, are not soluble in water. 
Oil and vinegar (water solution) 
salad dressing separates because oil 
is not soluble in water. Liquids that 
are not soluble in water may be 
soluble in other solvents. For 
example, vegetable oil is soluble in 
mineral spirits, a petrolem-based 
solvent used to thin paints.

life are sustained by dissolved oxygen in

polar - describes a molecule that 
has charge separation, like water.
Water as a solvent
The universal
solvent
Water is often called the “universal solvent.” While water doesn’t 
dissolve everything, it does dissolve many different types of 
substances such as salts and sugars. Water is a good solvent because 
of the way the H2O molecule is shaped (Figure 9.7). 
Water is a polar
molecule
A water molecule has a negative end (pole) and a positive end. This is 
because electrons are shared unequally; pulled toward the oxygen 
atom and away from the two hydrogen atoms. The oxygen side of the 
molecule has a partially negative charge and the hydrogen side of the 
molecule has a partially positive charge. A molecule (like water) with 
a charge separation is called a polar molecule.
How water
dissolves  salt
The polar molecules of water dissolve many ionic compounds. 
Suppose a sodium chloride (table salt) crystal is mixed with water. 
The polar water molecules surround the sodium and chlorine atoms 
in the crystal. This causes the ions in the crystal to separate. Because 
opposites attract, the negative ends of the water molecules are 
attracted to the Na+ ions and the positive ends are attracted to the 
Cl- ions. Water molecules surround the Na+ and Cl- ions and make a 
solution (Figure 9.8).
Water dissolves
many molecular
compounds
When sucrose is mixed with water, the individual molecules of 
sucrose become separated from each other and are attracted to the 
opposite poles of the water molecules. Because sucrose is a covalent 
compound, the sucrose molecules do not dissociate into ions but 
remain as neutral molecules in the solution.
Water does not
dissolve oils
Oil does not dissolve in water because 
water is a polar molecule and oil 
molecules are nonpolar. In general, 
like dissolves like: water dissolves 
polar substances and non-polar 
solvents (like mineral spirits) dissolve 
non-polar substances.

9.2 Acids, Bases, and pH
Acids and bases are among the most familar of all chemical compounds. Some of the 
acids you may have encountered include acetic acid (found in vinegar), citric acid (found 
in orange juice), and malic acid (found in apples). You may be familiar with some bases 
including ammonia in cleaning solutions and magnesium hydroxide found in some 
antacids. The pH scale is used to describe whether a substance is an acid or a base. This 
section is about properties of acids and bases, and how the pH scale works.
What are acids?
Properties of
acids
An acid is a compound that dissolves in water to make a particular 
kind of solution. Some properties of acids are listed below and some 
common acids are shown in Figure 9.9. Note: you should NEVER 
taste a laboratory chemical!
• Acids create the sour taste in food, like lemons.
• Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen gas (H2).
• Acids change the color of blue litmus paper to red.
• Acids can be very corrosive, destroying metals and burning skin
through chemical action.
Acids make
hydronium ions
Chemically, an acid is any substance that produces hydronium ions 
(H3O+) when dissolved in water. When hydrochloric acid (HCl) 
dissolves in water it ionizes, splitting up into hydrogen (H+) and 
chlorine (Cl-) ions. Hydrogen ions (H+) are attracted to the negative 
oxygen end of a water molecule, combining to form hydronium ions.

hydroxide ions (OH -). A good example of a base is sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH), found in many commercial drain cleaners. This compound 
dissociates in water to form sodium (Na+) and hydroxide ions:
Ammonia  is a
base
Ammonia (NH3), found in cleaning solutions, is a base because it 
dissociates in water to form hydroxide ions. Notice that a hydroxide 
ion is formed when ammonia accepts H+ ions from water molecules in 
solution as shown below. How is this different than NaOH? 
Figure 9.10: Some common bases.
base - a substance that produces 
hydroxide ions (OH -) when 
dissolved in water. Bases have a 
pH greater than 7.

UNIT 4 MATTER AND CHANGE
Figure 9.11:  Acetic acid dissolves in 
water, but only a few molecules ionize 
(break apart) to create hydronium ions.
Figure 9.12: Sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH) is a strong base because every 
NaOH unit contributes one hydroxide 
(OH-) ion. 
Strength of acids and bases
The strength of
acids
The strength of an acid depends on the concentration of hydronium 
ions the acid produces when dissolved in water. Hydrochloric acid 
(HCl) is a strong acid because HCl completely dissolves into H+ and 
Cl- ions in water. This means that every molecule of HCl that 
dissolves produces one hydronium ion.
Acetic acid is a
weak acid
Acetic acid (HC2H3O2), (in vinegar), is an a weak acid. When 
dissolved in water, only a small percentage of acetic acid molecules 
ionize (break apart) and become H+ and C2H3O2
- ions. This means 
that a small number of hydronium ions are produced compared to the 
number of acetic acid molecules dissolved (Figure 9.11).
The strength of
bases
The strength of a base depends on the relative amount of hydroxide 
ions (OH-) produced when the base is mixed with water. Sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH) is considered a strong base because it dissociates 
completely in water to form Na+ and OH- ions. Every unit of NaOH 
that dissolves creates one OH- ion (Figure 9.12). Ammonia (NH3) on 
the other hand, is a weak base because only a few molecules react 
with water to form NH4
+ and OH- ions.
Water can be a
weak acid or a
weak base
One of the most important properties of water is its ability to act as 
both an acid and as a base. In the presence of an acid, water acts as a 
base. In the presence of a base, water acts as an acid. In pure water, 
the H2O molecule ionizes to produce both hydronium and hydroxide 
ions. This reaction is called the dissociation of water.
What does the
double arrow
mean?
The double arrow in the equation means that the dissociation of 
water can occur in both directions. This means that water molecules 
can ionize and ions can also form water molecules. However, water 
ionizes so slightly that most water molecules exist whole, not as ions.

9.2 ACIDS, BASES, AND PH
CHAPTER 9: ACIDS, BASES, AND SOLUTIONS
pH and the pH scale
What is pH?
The pH scale describes the concentration of hydronium ions in a 
solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, 
neither acidic nor basic. Distilled water has a pH of 7. 
Acids have a pH less than 7. A concentrated solution of a strong acid 
has the lowest pH. Strong hydrochloric acid has a pH of 1. Seltzer 
water is a weak acid at a pH of 4. Weaker acids have a pH nearer to 7.
A base has a pH greater than 7. A concentrated solution of a strong 
base has the highest pH. A strong sodium hydroxide solution can have 
a pH close to 14. Weak bases such as baking soda have pH closer to 7.
The pH of
common
substances
Table 9.3 lists the pH of some common substances. It turns out that many 
foods we eat or ingredients we use for cooking are acidic. On the other hand, 
many of our household cleaning products are bases.
pH indicators
Certain chemicals turn different colors at different pH. These 
chemicals are called pH indicators and they are used to determine pH. 
The juice of boiled red cabbage is a pH indicator that is easy to 
prepare. Red cabbage juice is deep purple and turns various shades 
ranging to yellow at different values of pH. Litmus paper is another 
pH indicator that changes color (Figure 9.13).

chemicals.

Figure 9.14: Blueberries grow best 
in acid soils that have a pH between 5.0 
and 5.5.
Test your soil pH
Many garden centers offer soil 
testing kits. These kits are 
specially designed to measure the 
pH of soil. Measure the soil around 
your house or school. What sorts 
of plants would thrive in the pH 
range is that you measure? 
pH in the environment
The best pH for
plants
The pH of soil directly affects nutrient availability for plants. Most 
plants prefer a slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.5 and 7.0. 
Azaleas, blueberries, and conifers grow best in more acid soils with a 
pH of 4.5 to 5.5 (Figure 9.14). Vegetables, grasses and most other 
shrubs do best in less acidic soils with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.0. 
Effects of pH too
high or low
In highly acid soils (pH below 4.5) too much aluminum, manganese 
and other elements may leach out of soil minerals and reach 
concentrations that are toxic to plants. Also, at these low pH values, 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are less available to plant roots. 
At pH values of 6.5 and above, (more basic), iron and manganese 
become less available.
pH and fish
The pH of water directly affects aquatic life. 
Most freshwater lakes, streams, and ponds have 
a natural pH in the range of 6 to 8. Most 
freshwater fish can tolerate pH between 5 and 9 
although some negative effects appear below pH 
of 6. Trout (like the california golden) are among the most pH 
tolerant fish and can live in water with a pH from 4 to 9.5.
pH and
amphibians
Frogs and other amphibians are even more 
sensitive to pH than fish. The California 
tree frog, and other frogs prefer pH close to 
neutral and don’t survive below pH of 5.0.  
Frogs eggs develop and hatch in water with 
no protection from environmental factors. 
Research shows that even pH below 6 has a 
negative effect on frog hatching rates.

9.2 ACIDS, BASES, AND PH
CHAPTER 9: ACIDS, BASES, AND SOLUTIONS
Acids and bases in your body
Acids and bases
play a role in
digestion
Many reactions, such as the ones that occur in your body, work best at 
specific pH values. For example, acids and bases are very important in 
the reactions involved in digesting food. As you may know, the 
stomach secretes hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid (pH 1.4). The 
level of acidity in our stomachs is necessary to break down the protein 
molecules in food so they can be absorbed. A mucus lining in the 
stomach protects it from the acid produced (Figure 9.15).
Ulcers and
heartburn
Very spicy foods, stress, or poor diet can cause the stomach to produce 
too much acid, or allow stomach acid to escape from the stomach. An 
ulcer may occur when the mucus lining of the stomach is damaged. 
Stomach acid can then attack the more sensitive tissues of the 
stomach itself. Infections by the bacteria h. pylori can also damage the 
mucus lining of the stomach, leading to ulcers. The uncomfortable 
condition called heartburn is caused by excessive stomach acid 
backing up into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries 
food from your mouth to your stomach. The esophagus lacks the 
mucus lining of the stomach and is sensitive to acid. Eating very large 
meals can lead to heartburn because an overflowing stomach pushes 
acid up into the esophagus.
pH and your
blood
Under normal conditions the pH of your blood is within the range of 
7.3 - 7.5, close to neutral but slightly basic. Blood is a watery solution 
that contains many solutes including the dissolved gases carbon 
dioxide (CO2) and oxygen. Dissolved CO2 in blood produces a weak 
acid. The higher the concentration of dissolved CO2, the more acidic 
your blood becomes.
Blood pH is
controlled
through
breathing
Your body regulates the dissolved CO2 level by breathing. For 
example, if you hold your breath, more carbon dioxide enters your 
blood and the pH falls as your blood becomes more acid. If you 
hyperventilate, less carbon dioxide enters your blood and the opposite 
happens. Blood pH starts to rise, becoming more basic. Your breathing 
rate regulates blood pH through these chemical reactions 
(Figure 9.16).
Figure 9.15: The stomach secretes  a 
strong acid (HCl) to aid with food 
digestion. A mucus lining protects the 
stomach tissue from the acid.
Figure 9.16: Under normal 
conditions, your blood pH ranges 
between 7.35 and 7.45. Holding your 
breath causes blood pH to drop. High 
blood pH can be caused by 
hyperventilating.

194
UNIT 4 MATTER AND CHANGE
Test your soil
Almost any 
garden center 
carries soil test kits. These kits 
have pH test papers inside and 
are designed to help gardeners 
measure the pH of their soil. 
Get a soil test kit and test 
samples of soil from around 
your home or school. Repeat the 
test taking new soil samples 
after a rainfall to see if the pH 
changes. See if you can answer 
these questions:
• What kinds of plants thrive
in the pH of the soil samples
you tested?
• Is the soil the proper pH for
the plants you found where
you took your soil samples?
• What kinds of treatments
are available at your local
garden center for correcting
soil pH?
Neutralization reactions
Neutralization
When an acid and a base are combined, they neutralize each other. 
Neutralization occurs when the positive ions from the base combine 
with the negative ions from the acid. This process also goes on in your 
body. As food and digestive fluids leave the stomach, the pancreas 
and liver produce bicarbonate (a base) to neutralize the stomach acid. 
Antacids such as sodium bicarbonate have the same effect.
Adjusting soil pH
Neutralization reactions are important in gardening and farming. 
For example about 1/4 of the yards in the US have soil which is too 
acidic (pH less than 5.5) to grow grass very well. For this reason, 
many people add lime to their yard every spring. A common form of 
lime is ground-up calcium carbonate (CaCO3) made from natural 
crushed limestone. Lime is a weak base and undergoes a 
neutralization reaction with acids in the soil to raise the pH. 
Neutralization of
acid in soil
For example, sulfuric acid (H2S) in soil reacts with the calcium 
carbonate to form the salt calcium sulfate (CaSO4) also known as 
gypsum. Sulfuric acid is in acid rain and is created in the atmosphere 
from pollutants in the air. Many of the walls of buildings and homes 
are made with “plaster board” which is a sheet of gypsum (plaster) 
covered with paper on both sides.

in the pond is related to the pH of the pond. The records that 
document the water quality and wildlife started ten years ago. 
Describe the steps you would take to determine whether a change 
in the pH of the pond water is affecting the population of frogs and 
their ability to reproduce.

196
Keeping Your (pH) Balance
You know that solutions have a pH. A test paper dipped in a 
solution will show whether it is an acid (acidic) or a base 
(alkaline). Did you know the same is true of the blood that 
courses through your body? Our bodies are constantly 
adjusting to keep our blood pH in a normal range between 
7.35 and 7.45. Yes, we are slightly alkaline. 
Acids and bases are everywhere. Many of our favorite foods 
are acidic: Lemons and oranges, for instance, contain citric 
acid. We depend on gastric acid in our stomachs to digest our 
food - and if we eat or drink unwisely, we suffer stomach 
pains caused by that same gastric acid. Then to counter the 
acid, we have antacids and baking soda.
Imbalances
The human body’s many different processes produce a great 
deal of acid, which then must be removed. For example, our 
lungs can dispose of excess acid; carbon dioxide can form 
carbonic acid by causing us to breathe faster. Our kidneys 
remove excess acid from the blood and dispose of it in urine. 
But disease or extreme conditions can interfere with the 
body’s self-adjusting system.
There are two types of 
imbalance. We can have too 
much acid in our body fluids, or 
those fluids can be too alkaline. 
Too much acid is called acidosis 
and too much alkali is called 
alkalosis.
These imbalances are either 
respiratory or metabolic. When 
the lungs are not functioning 
properly, the imbalance is respiratory. When the body’s 
physical and chemical processing of substances is not 
functioning properly, the imbalance is metabolic.
Chapter 9 Connection

197
UNIT 4  MATTER AND CHANGE
Acidosis and its causes
Respiratory acidosis occurs when the lungs cannot remove 
all of the carbon dioxide produced by the body. As a result, 
body fluids become too acidic. This can be caused by almost 
any lung disease, such as asthma, or by a deadly habit like 
cigarette smoking. 
Treatment may include drugs that expand the air passages 
in the lungs. Inhaled oxygen may be used to raise the oxygen 
level in the blood. Stopping smoking is a given among these 
attempts to restore the body’s pH balance. 
Metabolic acidosis is a pH imbalance in which the body has 
too much acid. The body does not have enough bicarbonate 
needed to neutralize the excess acid. This can be caused by a 
disease like diabetes, or by severe diarrhea, heart or liver 
failure, kidney disease, or even prolonged exercise. 
A result of prolonged exercise is a buildup of lactic acid, 
which causes the blood to become acidic. Fluids can restore 
the body’s pH balance, which is why various sports drinks 
are popular among athletes. Those drinks are formulated to 
help the body maintain its pH balance under stress. 
Alkalosis and its causes
The opposite of acidosis, alkalosis is the result of too much 
base in the body’s fluids. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by 
hyperventilation, that is, extremely rapid or deep breathing 
that makes the body lose too much carbon dioxide. It can be 
provoked by anxiety. In such a case, the person may breathe 
(or be helped to breathe) into a paper bag. Why? Because the 
bag retains the exhaled carbon dioxide and it can be taken 
back in. Altitude or any disease that causes the body to lose 
carbon dioxide may also cause hyperventilation. Metabolic 
alkalosis is a result of too much bicarbonate in the blood. 
Other types of alkalosis are caused by too little chloride or 
potassium. Alkalosis symptoms include confusion, muscle 
twitching or spasms, hand tremors, nausea, and 
lightheadedness. 
Balancing act:
food, drink, exercise, calm, acid, base …
By nature our slightly 
alkaline pH needs to 
remain balanced there. 
Yet, what we eat and drink 
changes our pH. If you eat 
a lot of meat such as 
hamburgers, steak, and 
chicken, your body 
produces more acid than 
someone who eats a lot of 
vegetables and fruits. If we 
don’t balance what we eat, 
the body has to rely on 
reserves. For example, if 
you eat a lot of meat and no vegetables, your pH becomes 
acidic. Your kidneys can handle only so much acid and, in 
this case, the reserve the body would use is bicarbonate from 
your bones to help neutralize the acid level.
This is just one more instance in which the food we eat can 
affect our bodies in many ways. Maintaining a balanced diet 
is the first step toward good health—a little on the alkaline 
side.

1. What two organs regulate the acid-base balance?
2. What is a common cause of hyperventilation? 
3. How is the alkalosis caused by hyperventilation treated?

Acid Rain and Stone Structures
Acid rain resulting from air pollution is a growing problem in 
the industrialized world. It can have devastating effects on 
the pH of our lakes. Interestingly, while the pH of some 
lakes has dropped dramatically in recent years, the pH of 
some nearby lakes during the same time period has changed 
very little. The type of rock that is found beneath and around 
the body of water is is what makes the difference. Calcium 
carbonate, which is found in marble and limestone, has the 
ability to neutralize acid rain while other types of rocks and 
minerals have no effect. In this activity, we will make 
solutions of water and soak chips of different types of rock to 
see their effect on a dilute acid.
We will measure the pH of each solution using an indicator 
solution. The indicator solution appears red at a pH of 4, 
orange to yellow at a pH of 6.5, green to blue at a pH of 9, 
and violet to red-violet at pH of 10.

Chemical Reactions
When some people think of chemistry, they often think of things 
that suddenly give off smelly odors, or explode. The process that 
makes the “stink” in a “stink bomb” and an explosion are 
examples of chemical reactions. Chemical reactions occur 
everywhere around you every day. Chemical reactions happen in 
the engines of automobiles to make them go. Chemical reactions 
happen in plants that release oxygen into the atmosphere. 
Would you be surprised to learn that chemical strong enough to 
dissolve metal is in your stomach all the time? The chemical is 
hydrochloric acid and it is a necessary part of the chemical 
process of breaking food down into nutrients that can be used by 
your body. In fact, chemical reactions are responsible for most of 
the food digestion that occurs in your body each day, as well as 
many other body processes.  In this chapter you will learn what 
chemical reactions are and how they occur.

10.1 Understanding Chemical Reactions
If you leave a tarnished copper penny in acid for a few minutes the penny becomes shiny 
again. The copper oxide that tarnished the penny was removed by a chemical reaction 
with the acid. Chemical reactions are the process through which chemical changes 
happen.
Chemical changes rearrange chemical bonds
Chemical change
Ice melting is an example of a physical change. During a physical 
change, a substance changes its form but remains the same 
substance. A chemical change turns one or more substances into 
different substances that usually have different properties. An 
example of chemical change is burning wood into ashes.
Using chemical
changes
We use chemical changes to create useful materials. The rubber in 
car tires is an example of a material that has been modified by 
chemical changes. A chemical change called vulcanization inserts 
pairs of sulfur atoms into the long chain molecules of natural rubber. 
The sulfur ties adjacent molecules together like rungs on a ladder 
and makes vulcanized rubber much harder and more durable.
Recognizing
chemical change
A chemical reaction is a system of chemical changes that involves 
the breaking and reforming of chemical bonds to create new 
substances. A chemical reaction occurs when you mix baking soda 
with vinegar. The mixture bubbles violently as carbon dioxide gas, a 
new substance, is formed. The temperature of the mixture also gets 
noticeably colder. Bubbling, new substances, and temperature 
change can all be evidence of chemical change (Figure 10.1).

CHAPTER 10: CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Products and reactants
Products and
reactants
How do we show the chemical reaction between baking soda and 
vinegar (Figure 10.2)?  In cooking, you start with ingredients that are 
combined to make different foods. In chemical reactions, you start 
with reactants that are combined to make products. The reactants 
are substances which are combined and changed in the chemical 
reaction (baking soda and vinegar). The products are the new 
substances which result from the chemical reaction. The reactants 
and products may include atoms, compounds, and energy. 
Products may
change phase in
a reaction
The substances in a chemical reaction may be in different phases. In 
this reaction the reactants are a solid (baking soda) and a liquid 
solution (vinegar). What are the products? The bubbling that goes on 
is a clue that at least one of the products is a gas.
Start by counting
the atoms in the
products
Chemically, the components that react are sodium bicarbonate 
(NaHCO3) in the baking soda and acetic acid (HC2H3O2) in the 
vinegar. The first step in understanding the reaction is to see what 
atoms are in the reactants. If you count them you see there are four 
elements: carbon, oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen. The reaction must 
rearrange these same atoms into the products.

effervescent tablet is dropped into 
water. The tablet contains sodium 
bicarbonate and citric acid. The 
reactants are:
NaHCO3 + H+ (from citric acid) + 
H2O
Can you figure out what the 
products are? Hint: This reaction 
creates a bubbling gas, too.
The products of the reaction
Figuring out the
products
The chemical reaction rearranges the same atoms in the reactants to 
become new compounds in the products. In this case, the 3 carbon, 5 
oxygen, 5 hydrogen, and 1 sodium atoms are rearranged to become 
sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2), water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). 
Note that the same exact atoms in the reactants are rearranged to 
make the products. No new atoms are created!
The whole
reaction
We can now see the whole reaction clearly. Only three chemical bonds 
actually change. The sodium ion jumps to the acetic acid to make 
sodium acetate. The rest of the bicarbonate breaks up into water and 
carbon dioxide. Since carbon dioxide is a gas, that explains the 
bubbles observed during the reaction.

CHAPTER 10: CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Chemical equations
Understanding a
chemical
equation
A chemical equation is an abbreviated way to show the exact 
numbers of atoms and compounds in a chemical reaction. Without 
drawing elaborate diagrams, we can write the baking soda and 
vinegar reaction as a chemical equation. The arrow shows the 
direction the reaction goes, from reactants to products.
Conservation of
mass
Notice that there are the exact same number of each type of atom on 
the reactant side of the equation as there are on the product side. 
There are three carbon atoms in the reactants and three carbon atoms 
in the products. This demonstrates that chemical reactions conserve 
mass. The total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the 
products because they are the same atoms! They have just been 
rearranged into new compounds.
Demonstrating
conservation of
mass
Once you understand atoms and reactions, conservation of mass is a 
perfectly obvious result. The mass is the same because the atoms are 
the same atoms. Of course, demonstrating the conservation of mass in 
this reaction is tricky because one of the products is a gas! It took a 
long time before people realized that mass is conserved because they 
were fooled by their own measurements. If you compared the mass of 
the reactants and products as shown in Figure 10.3, what do you think 
you will find? Can you think of a way to do the experiment so that no 
mass escapes being measured?
Conservation of mass
The mass of the 
reactants equals the 
mass of the products

demonstrate conservation of mass this 
way, what would you find? Would the 
mass of the reactants equal the mass of 
the products?

UNIT 4 MATTER AND CHANGE
Understanding the numbers 
in a chemical equation
The large number 2 in “2H2O” 
tells you there are two 
molecules of H2O in the 
reaction. The large number is  
called a coefficient. If a 
coefficient is not written it is 
understood to be “1.”
The little numbers (subscripts) 
tell you how many atoms of 
each element there are in one 
molecule. For example, the 
subscript 2 in H2O means there 
are two hydrogen atoms in a 
single water molecule. 
The hydrogen-oxygen reaction 
releases a lot of energy and many 
people hope hydrogen will replace 
gasoline as a fuel for cars.
Balancing chemical equations
Multiple
compound
reactions
The baking soda and vinegar reaction was a good one to learn about 
chemical equations because only one kind of each compound 
appeared. However, many reactions involve more than one compound 
of each type. A good example is the reaction that combines hydrogen 
and oxygen to produce water.
Start with the
un-balanced
reaction
The reaction combines hydrogen and oxygen molecules as shown.
Count the atoms
on each side
Next we count the atoms to see if there are the same number of each 
type of atom on the reactant and product sides of the equation.
There is one more oxygen atom on the reactant side than there is on 
the product side. This means the reaction equation is not balanced. A 
balanced chemical equation has the same number of each type of 
atom on the product side and the reactant side.
The balanced
chemical
equation
To balance the equation, we add another water molecule to the 
product side. Now there are equal numbers of oxygen atoms on both 
sides. However, there aren’t equal numbers of hydrogen atoms, so 
another hydrogen molecule is added to the reactant side.

(3) Count the number of atoms 
of each element  in the 
reactants and the products.
(4) Adjust the coefficient of each 
reactant or product until the 
total number of each type of

of the equation. This is done by 
trial and error.
Important reminder: You can 
NOT change subscripts in order 
to balance an equation. For 
example, calcium chloride has 
the chemical formula, CaCl2. 
You can NOT change the 
subscript on Cl from 2 to 3 and 
make CaCl3 to get an extra 
chlorine atom. CaCl3 is a totally 
different compound than CaCl2. 
You can only change coefficients 
to balance equations.

Figure 10.4: Exothermic and 
endothermic reactions.
exothermic - a reaction is 
exothermic if it releases more 
energy than it uses.
endothermic - A reaction is 
endothermic if it uses more energy 
than it releases.
10.2 Energy and chemical reactions
If you have ever felt the heat from a campfire or fireplace, you have experienced the 
energy from a chemical reaction. Burning is a chemical reaction that gives off energy in 
the form of heat and light. In plants, photosynthesis is a reaction that uses energy from 
sunlight (Figure 10.4). In fact, all chemical reactions involve energy.
The two types of reactions
Energy is
involved in two
ways
Energy is involved in chemical reactions in two ways. (1) At the start 
of a chemical reaction, some (or all) bonds between atoms in the 
reactants must be broken so that the atoms are available to form new 
bonds. (2) Energy is released when new bonds form as the atoms 
recombine into the new compounds of the products. We classify 
chemical reactions based on how energy used in (1) compares to 
energy released in (2).
Exothermic
reactions
If forming new bonds releases more energy than it takes to break the 
old bonds, the reaction is exothermic. Once started, exothermic 
reactions tend to keep going because each reaction releases enough 
energy to start the reaction in neighboring molecules. A good example 
is the burning of hydrogen in oxygen. If we include energy, the 
balanced reaction looks like this.
Endothermic
reactions
If forming new bonds in the products releases less energy than it took 
to break the original bonds in the reactants, the reaction is 
endothermic. Endothermic reactions absorb energy. These reactions 
need energy to keep going. An example of an important endothermic 
reaction is photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, plants use energy in 
sunlight to make glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. 

209
10.2 ENERGY AND CHEMICAL REACTIONS
CHAPTER 10: CHEMICAL REACTIONS
Activation energy
An interesting
question
Exothermic reactions occur because the atoms arranged as compounds 
of the products have lower energy then they had when arranged as 
compounds of the reactants. Since this is true, why don’t all of the 
elements immediately combine into the molecules that have the 
lowest possible energy? 
Activation energy
The answer has to do with  activation energy. Activation energy is 
the energy needed to start a reaction and break chemical bonds in the 
reactants. Without enough activation energy, a reaction will not 
happen even if it releases energy when it does happen. That is why a 
flammable material, like gasoline, does not burn without a spark or 
flame. The spark supplies the activation energy to start the reaction.
An example
reaction
The diagram above shows how the energy flows in the reaction of 
hydrogen and oxygen. The activation energy must be supplied to 
break the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen apart. Combining 4 free 
hydrogen and oxygen atoms into 2 water molecules releases energy. 
The reaction is exothermic because the energy released by forming 
water is greater than the activation energy. Once the reaction starts, 
it supplies its own activation energy and quickly grows (Figure 10.5).
Thermal energy
A reaction starts by itself when thermal energy is greater than the 
activation energy. Any reaction which could start by itself, probably 
already has! The compounds and molecules that we see around us are 
ones that need more activation energy to change into anything else.
Figure 10.5: Because energy released 
by one reaction supplies activation 
energy for new reactions, exothermic 
reactions can grow quickly once 
activation energy has been supplied.
activation energy - energy 
needed to break chemical bonds in 
the reactants to start a reaction.

addition reactions that join

Addition reactions
Compounds are
made in addition
reactions
In an addition reaction, two or more substances combine to form a 
new compound. A good example of an addition reaction is the 
formation of rust (iron oxide, Fe2O3) from pure iron and dissolved 
oxygen in water. Iron oxide is an ionic crystal because the bonds 
between iron and oxygen are ionic bonds. Ionic crystals do not have 
structure diagrams like molecules however, they do have the specific 
ratio of atoms given by the chemical formula (2 Fe to every 3 O).
Polymerization is
an addition
reaction
As you saw earlier in this chapter, polymers are large molecules 
made up of repeating segments. The process of creating these 
molecules is called polymerization. Polymerization is a series of 
addition reactions that join small molecules into very long chain 
molecules. Polymers are made by joining smaller molecules called 
monomers.
Acid rain
Some fossil fuels, like coal, contain sulfur. When these fuels are 
burned, the sulfur reacts with oxygen in the air to form sulfur dioxide 
in an addition reaction. In air polluted with sulfur dioxide, sulfur 
trioxide is create when sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen. Finally, 
sulfuric acid is produced by a third addtion reaction of sulfur trioxide 
with water.

Decomposition reactions
Describing the
phase of a
product or

In many cases, you wish to know the form of the products and reactant 
in a reaction. Are they solid, liquid or gas? Are they dissolved in 
water? The small symbols in the parentheses (s, l, g, aq) next to each 
chemical formula indicate the phase of each component in the reaction 
(Figure 10.7). 
Decomposition
reactions
A chemical reaction in which a single compound is broken down to 
produce two or more smaller compounds is called a decomposition 
reaction. The simplest kind of decomposition is the breakdown of a 
binary compound into its elements, as in the decomposition of water 
into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity:
Larger compounds can also decompose to produce other compounds, as in the
decomposition of baking soda with heat:

Displacement and precipitation reactions
In single
displacement,
one element
replaces another
In single-displacement reactions, one element replaces a similar 
element in a compound. For example, if you place an iron nail into a 
beaker of copper (II) chloride solution, you will begin to see reddish 
copper forming on the iron nail. In this reaction, iron replaces copper 
in the solution and the copper falls out of the solution as a metal:
Precipitation
occurs when one
product is
insoluble
In many reactions dissolved substances react to form substances that 
are no longer soluble. The insoluble product drops out of solution, 
forming a  precipitate. A precipitate is a solid product that comes out 
of solution in a chemical reaction. Precipitates usually form many 
small particles which cause a cloudy appearance in a solution 
(Figure 10.8). 
The limewater test for carbon dioxide is a precipitation reaction. In 
this test, a gas suspected of containing carbon dioxide is bubbled 
through a solution of CaO2H2 (limewater). Any carbon dioxide in the 
gas reacts to form a precipitate, turning the solution milky-white.

Combustion reactions
Petroleum is a
mixture of
hydrocarbons
Almost 40 percent of all the energy we use comes from petroleum (oil) 
and 2/3 of that is gasoline and diesel fuel. Petroleum is not a single 
substance but a complex mixture of many substances created over 
millions of years by the decay of plants and animals. The major 
elements in petroleum are hydrogen and carbon, with smaller 
amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.
Refining
The refining process separates petroleum into molecules with different 
numbers of carbon atoms. The smaller molecules are used in gasoline. 
Heavier molecules become kerosene and heating oil. The heaviest 
molecules become tar and asphalt used for roads (Figure 10.9).
The reactions of
burning gasoline
In a perfect reaction, all the hydrocarbon molecules are completely 
burned to into carbon dioxide and water. Unfortunately, in an engine 
not all the fuel burns completely and pollutants such as carbon 
monoxide are also formed. Impurities in fuel, such as sulfur and 
nitrogen in the air, also have reactions that form pollutants such as 
oxides of nitrogen and sulfuric acid.

Figure 10.10: Comparing nuclear and 
chemical reactions.
nuclear reaction - a process 
that changes the nucleus of an 
atom and may turn one element 
into a completely different 
element.
Nuclear reactions
What is a nuclear
reaction?
Nuclear reactions change the nucleus of an atom. Until just 100 years 
ago people looked for a way to turn lead into gold. With today’s 
understanding of nuclear reactions, it is now possible. However, we 
don’t do it very often because the process is much more expensive 
than gold itself!
Nuclear versus
chemical
Because they affect the nucleus itself, nuclear reactions can change 
one element into a different element. Nuclear reactions can also 
change an isotope into a different isotope of the same element. 
Remember, isotopes of the same element have the same number of 
protons but different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. By 
comparison, chemical reactions do not change the types of atoms. 
Chemical reactions only rearrange atoms into different compounds. 
Nuclear reactions
involve more
energy than
chemical
reactions
Nuclear reactions involve much more energy than chemical reactions. 
The energy in a nuclear reaction is much greater because nuclear 
reactions involve the strong nuclear force, the strongest force in the 
universe. Chemical reactions involve electrical forces. The electrical 
force acting on an electron far from the nucleus is much smaller than 
the strong force acting on a proton or neutron inside the nucleus. The 
difference in strength between the forces involved is the reason 
nuclear reactions are so much more energetic than chemical reactions 
(Figure 10.10).
Mass and energy
in nuclear
reactions
Mass and energy are conserved together but not separately in nuclear 
reactions. This is because nuclear reactions can convert mass into 
energy. If you could take apart a nucleus and separate all of its 
protons and neutrons, the separated protons and neutrons would 
have more mass than the nucleus does all together. This bizarre fact 
is explained by Einstein’s formula (E = mc2), which tells us that mass 
(m) can be converted to energy (E), when multiplied by the speed of 
light (c) squared. The mass of a nucleus is reduced by the energy that 
is released when the nucleus comes together.

The Science of Hot and Cold Packs
Have you ever had an injury, such as to you knee or back? If 
so, chances are you have used a cold or hot pack to treat the 
injury and provide pain relief. Cold and hot packs can be 
made ready in an instant without refrigeration or a 
microwave. Although it seems that these packs magically 
work, it’s really a mini chemistry lab that lies within the 
plastic wrap.
Endothermic and exothermic reactions
Thermochemistry is the study of the heat given off or 
absorbed during a chemical 
reaction. A chemical reaction 
refers to when substances 
are mixed and new 
substances are formed. In 
chemical reactions, bonds 
between atoms are broken or 
formed, and heat may be 
given off or taken up during 
the process. 
With many chemical 
reactions, energy may be 
released in the form of heat. 
This is called an exothermic 
reaction. When an 
exothermic reaction occurs, 
bonds are made between 
atoms. During this bond 
making, energy is lost to the 
surroundings. As a result, 
exothermic reactions 
produce hot temperatures or 
may even be explosive.
Some chemical reactions can only be completed if they 
absorb energy. When a chemical reaction absorbs heat from 
the environment, it is called an endothermic reaction. In 
endothermic reactions, bonds are broken between atoms. 
Here, the energy required for bond breaking is absorbed 
from the surroundings. As a result, endothermic reactions 
produce cold temperatures. 
How hot and cold packs work
Let’s look at the so-called “magic” inside a common hot and 
cold packs. Usually these packs are pouches made of thick, 
strong plastic. The pouches contain a dry chemical in the 
form of a powder. Within the large pouch of hot and cold 
packs is an inner pouch made of thin, weak plastic. This 
inner pouch contains water. The packs are make active when 
the seal of the inner water pouch is broken and the contents 
are vigorously shaken. Water is released and mixes with the 
chemical in the outer pouch to create either an exothermic or 
endothermic reaction. 
Sounds simple, but let’s look at the chemicals involved. Hot 
packs are made of chemicals that produce an exothermic 
reaction when mixed with water. Usually, hot packs contain 
calcium chloride or magnesium sulfate. These chemicals 
release heat energy when mixed with water and raise the 
temperature of the pack. 
Cold packs work much the same way as hot packs, except 
different chemicals are used. Cold packs are made of 
chemicals that produce an endothermic reaction when mixed 
with water. Often, the chemical used in cold packs is 
ammonium nitrate. It absorbs heat energy and lowers the 
temperature of the pack. 
Chapter 10 Connection

217
UNIT 4  MATTER AND CHANGE
The concentrations of the water and chemicals determine 
how hot or cold a pack gets. Commercial hot and cold packs 
typically last for about twenty minutes. 
Hot and cold therapy 
Physical therapists and sports trainers often use hot packs 
and cold packs to treat patients and athletes with injuries. 
However, the type of pack that should be used depends on 
the nature of injury. 
Applying heat to your body can improve the flexibility of 
your tendons and ligaments. Tendons are bands of cordlike 
tissue that connect bone to muscle, while ligaments are 
cordlike tissues that connect bone to bone. Heat therapy can 
also reduce muscle spasms, reduce pain, and increase blood 
flow. The exact way in which heat relieves pain is not known. 
However, researchers think that heat inactivates nerves 
fibers that can force muscles to spasm. Heat may also induce 
the release of endorphins. Endorphins are chemicals in our 
body that block the transmission of pain by our nerves. Heat 
applied to body parts also relaxes the walls of blood vessels, 
resulting in increased blood flow. Health care professionals 
recommend using heat to untighten muscles and increase 
overall flexibility. However, it is best to avoid heating up 
already inflamed joints.
Like heat therapy, cold therapy may also be used to reduce 
muscle spasms. Muscle spasms are reduced with cold 
therapy because muscles fibers become less sensitive to 
being stretched. Cold is also useful for reducing pain and 
swelling. Cold therapy slows pain by reducing the speed of 
nerve impulses. Most tissue swelling is drastically decreased 
when cold and compression are applied to an injured area. 
The cold temperature constricts the walls of blood vessels, 
while the compression reduces the blood flow to the injured 
body part. Cold therapy is best used to reduce inflammation 
and swelling caused by sprains, strains, and bruises. 
A variety of inexpensive, disposable hot and cold packs can 
be purchased at pharmacy stores. So next time you 
experience a minor injury, just reach for the magic pack that 
fits your needs.

Explore Hot and Cold Packs
All chemical reactions are either exothermic (release energy) 
or endothermic (absorb energy). In addition, some physical 
processes such as dissolution (dissolving) can also release or 
absorb energy. This is the basis for commercially available 
hot packs and cold packs. Most hot and cold packs work by 
breaking a membrane that separates a solid and water. Once 
the membrane is broken the solid dissolves in the water. 
Depending on the nature of the compound, heat is either 
released (hot pack) or removed from the environment (cold 
pack) during the process.

The Chemistry of Living 
Systems
What is chemistry? If the image that comes to your mind is of a 
complicated array of tubes and smoking beakers, factories and 
stinky fumes, this chapter will paint quite a different picture. 
Chemistry is you. Like all living organisms, your body is an 
incredibly complex chemical machine taking in chemicals from 
food and causing countless chemical reactions to occur every 
second. In so many ways, the fundamental processes of life are 
chemistry.
If you take away the water, the rest of the human body is            
53 percent carbon by weight. The chemistry of living things is  
the chemistry of carbon and its compounds. Carbon is the basic 
building block in the complex molecules that make up all living 
things. This chapter is your introduction to a branch of 
chemistry — organic chemistry — that is devoted solely to 
carbon and carbon compounds.
1. Why is carbon so important to living things?
2. What are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and
DNA?
3. How does a living creature control its chemistry?

organic chemistry - the 
chemistry of carbon and carbon 
compounds.
11.1 The Chemistry of Carbon
The chemistry of life is largely the chemistry of the element carbon. About 65 percent of 
the human body is water. Of the remainder, 91 percent is only four elements: carbon, 
oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen (Figure 11.1). Of those four, carbon is the largest 
fraction at 53 percent. Carbon atoms often serve as the backbone to which oxygen, 
nitrogen and hydrogen are connected. Carbon is so important because it is the lightest 
element that can make up to four bonds at the same time, including bonds with itself.
Carbon molecules
Carbon forms
ring and chain
molecules
Carbon has four electrons in its outer energy level, and therefore four 
valence electrons. Carbon can share one or more electrons to make 
covalent bonds with itself or as many as four other elements. Carbon 
molecules come in three basic forms: straight chains, branching 
chains, and rings. All three forms are found in important biological 
molecules. For example, glucose is a sugar made by plants and valine 
is an amino acid found in proteins — and both are built on carbon.
Organic
chemistry is the
chemistry of
carbon
The three basic shapes are often combined (chains and rings) in the 
same molecule. Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that 
specializes in carbon and carbon compounds. Organic molecules are 
found in all living things and also in many nonliving substances such 
as candle wax and polyethylene plastic.

11.1 THE CHEMISTRY OF CARBON
CHAPTER 11: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIVING SYSTEMS
Molecules in plants and animals
The four types of
biological
molecules
Living creatures are such complex organisms that even today we have 
much to learn about the chemical reactions that take place inside us. 
Scientists classify the organic molecules in living things into four basic 
groups: carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and nucleic acids. All living 
things contain all four types of molecules. And each type of molecule 
includes thousands of different chemicals, some specific to plants, 
some to animals. It is only in the past few decades that biotechnology 
has been able to reveal the rich chemistry of living things.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are mainly composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen 
in a ratio of about 1:2:1. Carbohydrates exist as small molecules, like  
glucose, and long-chain molecules, like starches. Table sugar is a 
carbohydrate called sucrose. Sucrose is composed of two simple 
sugars, glucose and fructose, which are chained together (Figure 11.2).
Proteins
Proteins are large molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, 
nitrogen, and trace elements. Skin and muscle tissue are composed 
primarily of protein. A single protein may contain several thousand 
atoms in a complex structure.
Fats
Fats are medium-to-large nonpolar molecules that do not dissolve in 
water. Structurally, fats are long chains of carbon and hydrogen with 
different elements added every so often. Cholesterol is a fat that 
makes up part of the outer membrane of cells. Cholesterol is naturally 
essential to cells, but unnaturally high cholesterol may lead to heart 
disease.
Nucleic acids
Nucleic acids such as DNA store the genetic code that allows 
organisms to reproduce. DNA is a huge molecule with millions of 
individual atoms. All the information that makes you a human is 
stored as a coded sequence of component molecules within DNA.
Figure 11.2: Table sugar is sucrose, 
a carbohydrate made of two simple 
sugars: glucose and fructose.
carbohydrates - energy-rich  
sugars and starches.
proteins - large molecules found 
in animal and plant tissue.
fats - energy-rich hydrocarbon 
chain molecules.
nucleic acids - biological 
molecules such as DNA that have 
the ability to store the genetic 
code.

224
UNIT 4 MATTER AND CHANGE

the glucose molecule.
Figure 11.4: Starch and cellulose.
Carbohydrates
How
carbohydrates
are used
Carbohydrates are relatively small molecules used to store and 
transfer energy in living systems. Plant cells use energy from the sun 
to build carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water. Animal cells 
consume carbohydrates and extract the energy by breaking the 
carbohydrates into smaller molecules again. 
Starches and
sugars
Carbohydrates are classified as 
either sugars or starches. Sugars are 
the smaller of the two types. Sugars 
break down relatively quickly in the 
body, releasing energy within a short 
time of being eaten. Glucose is the 
simplest sugar and is dissolved 
directly into the bloodstream. 
Glucose is the
simplest sugar
Glucose is the primary energy source for cells. When dissolved in 
water, the chain structure of a glucose molecule curls around on itself 
to become a ring (Figure 11.3). The glucose molecule can have several 
variations in the order of the OH - H - OH groups on either side of the 
carbon backbone. Some animals are so specialized that they can only 
digest one form of glucose and not the others.
Starches are
chains of sugar
Starches are long chains of simple sugars joined together to make 
natural polymers. Because starches are larger molecules, they are 
slower to break down in the body and therefore can provide energy for 
a longer period than sugars. Corn, potatoes, and wheat contain 
substantial amounts of starches (Figure 11.4).
Cellulose
Cellulose is the primary molecule in plant fibers, including wood. The 
long-chain molecules of cellulose are what give wood its strength. 
Like starch, cellulose is made from chains of thousands of glucose 
molecules. However, in starch all the glucose units are the same 
orientation. In cellulose, alternate glucose units are inverted. This 
difference makes cellulose difficult for animals to digest. Trees grow 
so large partly because so few animals can digest wood.

11.1 THE CHEMISTRY OF CARBON
CHAPTER 11: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIVING SYSTEMS
Photosynthesis
The importance
of
photosynthesis
The energy that supports life on Earth starts with a reaction that 
takes energy from sunlight and stores it as chemical bonds in 
molecules of glucose and other simple sugars. This reaction is called 
photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs mostly in plants and in some 
types of bacteria.
The food chain
Photosynthesis is the foundation of the food chain on Earth. At the 
bottom of the food chain are producers, plants that take energy from 
the sun and convert it to chemical energy in glucose and other organic 
molecules. Animals (including ourselves) ultimately get energy from 
photosynthesis, because we eat plants or other animals that eat 
plants. Nearly all the energy in living things can be traced to this 
important reaction.
Photosynthesis
releases oxygen
Photosynthesis also produces the oxygen in our atmosphere. Without 
photosynthetic organisms, Earth could not support life. Although 
oxygen is a common element on Earth, it is usually trapped by rocks 
and minerals in compounds like calcium carbonate (CaCO3). 
Photosynthesis
removes CO2
Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For 
every glucose molecule produced, six molecules of carbon dioxide are 
removed from the air, and six molecules of oxygen are produced. 
Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation and therefore traps heat in 
the atmosphere. If too much carbon dioxide is present, the planet 
cannot cool itself by radiating energy into space. Higher levels of 
carbon dioxide may be responsible for the warming of Earth by several 
degrees over the past 200 years. Can you think of ways to stabilize 
carbon dioxide levels?
Figure 11.5: Photosynthesis is a 
chemical reaction that is the basis for the food 
chain on Earth.

226
UNIT 4 MATTER AND CHANGE
cellular respiration - the 
reactions in cells that release 
energy from glucose.
Respiration
Digestion
Animals get energy and nutrients by breaking up glucose, starch, and 
other organic molecules. The digestive system breaks food down into 
molecules the body can use. Proteins are split into amino acids. 
Carbohydrates are reduced to simple sugars. Fats are split into 
glycerol and fatty acids.  These nutrients are then absorbed into the 
blood and transported to all the cells of the body.  
Cellular
respiration
On the molecular level, cellular respiration breaks down glucose into 
water and carbon dioxide again, extracting energy in the process. The 
reactions of respiration proceed in many steps, but the end result is 
that glucose and oxygen are used up and carbon dioxide and water 
are produced. Respiration is almost the reverse of photosynthesis, 
releasing energy that originally came from the sun.
The ATP cycle
Each cell converts the energy in glucose into chemical energy stored 
in molecules of ATP. A cycle between ADP and ATP is the energy 
source of cells. In a series of complex reactions that also require 
oxygen, one molecule of glucose is used to convert a maximum of 36 to 
38 molecules of ADP to ATP. The ATP molecule is like a battery that 
distributes energy to where it is needed. Cells use the energy by 
converting the ATP back into ADP and the cycle starts over. 
Phosphorus is a critical part of the ADP-ATP cycle and one reason  
this element is an important nutrient.

227
11.1 THE CHEMISTRY OF CARBON
CHAPTER 11: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIVING SYSTEMS
The importance of water
Why water is
necessary
Liquid water is essential to life as we know it. The human body is 
typically between 60 and 65 percent water by weight. Most of the 
chemical reactions that sustain life only work in solution. Therefore, 
when scientists look for life on other planets, the first thing they look 
for is water. We believe Mars either had or has water on its surface or 
beneath its surface. That raises the tantalizing possibility that life 
may exist there.
There are three important characteristics of water that make it 
essential for life.
Water is a good
solvent
Water is a good solvent. In order to have a chemical reaction, 
molecules must be able to move around and contact each other. In a 
solid, this is just not possible. However, in a solution, molecules can 
move relatively large distances carrying energy and nutrients 
throughout a cell. Water also allows transport through the body on a 
larger scale. For example, oxygen is required by cells throughout the 
body, but it comes into the body in a centralized place: your lungs. Red 
blood cells absorb oxygen in the lungs and are carried throughout the 
body so they can distribute the oxygen.
Liquid over a
wide temperature
range
Water exists as a liquid over a large range of temperatures. In fact, 
virtually all living organisms on Earth are most active between the 
freezing and boiling point of water. The wide range over which water 
remains liquid allows most of Earth to be habitable most of the time. 
Very few biological processes can proceed when completely frozen 
because molecules: (a) cannot reach each other, and (b) have less 
thermal energy for activating reactions.
High specific
heat
Water has a high specific heat — one of the highest of any substance 
known. Water’s high specific heat means it takes a lot of energy to 
raise the temperature a small amount. This property of water helps 
living organisms maintain a stable body temperature even though 
outside temperatures may fluctuate a great deal.

planet and to living things, including 
you.

11.2 PROTEINS, FATS, AND NUCLEIC ACIDS
CHAPTER 11: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIVING SYSTEMS
11.2 Proteins, Fats, and Nucleic Acids
Carbohydrates are the simplest of the important biological molecules. Proteins, fats, and 
nucleic acids are more complex molecules, including thousands of individual atoms in a 
single molecule. Nucleic acids found in DNA are at the core of genetics, an active area of 
scientific research. The creation and functions of proteins are another area of active 
research. While we know a tremendous amount, we still have much to learn.
Fats
Fats provide
long-term energy
storage
Fats are high-energy molecules that plants and animals use to store 
energy in reserve for longer periods. Sugars break down too quickly to 
store energy reserves in a body. Fats are more complex molecules that 
take much longer to break down. Chemically, fats and oils are similar. 
Oils are fats that are liquid at room temperature. 
Saturated fats
A fat molecule has a two-part structure. The first part is called 
glycerol. Attached to the glycerol are 3 hydrocarbon chains. In a 
saturated fat the carbon atoms are surrounded by as many hydrogens 
as possible (Figure 11.8). 
Unsaturated fats
An unsaturated fat has fewer hydrogen atoms than it could have, 
meaning some of the carbon molecules have double bonds with each 
other instead of with hydrogen.  Chemical processing of food adds 
some hydrogen to unsaturated fats in a process called hydrogenation. 
Because they are harder to digest, partially hydrogenated fats have 
have a longer shelf life however, research is showing that partially 
hydrogenated fats may be unhealthy.

high-energy molecules organisms use to 
store energy reserves.

amino acids - organic molecules 
that are the building blocks of

Proteins
Proteins are large
molecules
Proteins are basic molecular building blocks of cells and all parts of 
animals. Muscle, skin, blood, and internal organs contain proteins. 
Second only to DNA, proteins are among the largest organic 
molecules. A relatively small protein is shown in Figure 11.9.
Proteins are
made of amino
acids
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Virtually all proteins 
found in animals are made from only 20 different amino acids.  The 
amino acids in a protein form multiple chains that fold around each 
other in complex structures (Figure 11.10).
Shape and
function
Only certain parts of a protein are chemically active. The shape of a 
protein determines which active sites are exposed. Many proteins 
work together by fitting into each other like a lock and key.  This is 
one reason proteins that do the same function in one organism do not 
work in another organism. For example, a skin protein from an 
animal cannot replace a skin protein from a human. 
Amino acids from
food are used to
build proteins
Food supplies new proteins that a body needs to live and grow. 
However, proteins from one organism cannot be used by another. 
Fortunately, the same 20 amino acids are found in proteins from 
almost all living things. In your body, digestion breaks down food 
protein into its component amino acids. Cells reassemble the amino 
acids into new proteins suitable for your body’s needs.

231
11.2 PROTEINS, FATS, AND NUCLEIC ACIDS
CHAPTER 11: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIVING SYSTEMS
Enzymes
The control
problem
Thousands of chemical reactions are going on in your body each 
second, involving thousands of chemicals. The reactions proceed at 
just the right rate to produce energy as it is needed. When you 
exercise, the reaction rate increases because your body needs more 
energy. How does your body control its chemical reactions?
The temperature
problem
Sugar (glucose) does not turn into water and carbon dioxide by itself. 
Outside the body, this reaction needs the intense heat of a flame. Yet 
your body causes this reaction to occur at only 37°C.  How does the 
body cause reactions like this to occur at low temperature? 
The answer is that enzymes allow your body to initiate chemical 
reactions at low temperature and to control the rate of reactions.
How enzymes
solve the
temperature
problem
Enzymes are special proteins that are catalysts for chemical 
reactions. A catalyst is a chemical that allows a reaction to have a 
much lower activation energy than it normally would. You can think 
of catalysts like helper molecules that allow a reaction to proceed in 
many small steps instead of all at once. Each step uses only the 
thermal energy provided by ordinary body temperature. 
How enzymes
solve the control
problem
The body controls the rate of reactions by regulating the amount of 
enzymes produced. For example, when a cell needs more energy, it 
produces more enzymes to break down glucose. Without those 
enzymes, glucose molecules stay together and store their energy for 
when it is needed.
catalyst - a chemical that allows 
a reaction to have a much lower 
activation energy than it normally 
would have.
enzymes - special proteins that 
are catalysts for chemical 
reactions in living things.
How do enzymes work?
Enzyme molecules have special 
shapes that allow them to bind to 
their target molecule. The body 
has thousands of different 
enzymes because each one is 
highly specific and only works on 
its target molecule. 
Enzymes are quite sensitive to 
temperature and pH. Most will not 
work outside a narrow range of 
temperature and pH.

information in DNA to assemble

DNA and nucleic acids
Protein synthesis
Cells must continually create the proteins they need from amino 
acids. This process is called protein synthesis and it occurs inside 
every cell of your body. How does protein synthesis work? How are 
the instructions for building proteins remembered and carried out?
DNA
The answer involves DNA, a nucleic acid. A DNA molecule is put 
together like a twisted ladder, or double helix (Figure 11.11). Each 
side of the ladder is made of 5-carbon sugars called deoxyribose and 
phosphate groups. The nitrogen bases are paired in the center of the 
ladder. DNA is among the largest molecules known. A single DNA 
molecule contains more than one million atoms.
The four nitrogen
bases
There are four nitrogen bases in two matched pairs, adenine (A) with 
cytosine (C) and thymine (T) with guanine (G). The assembly 
instructions for building a protein are coded in the sequence of 
nitrogen bases on one side of the ladder.  For example, TAA-GCT-
AGG-GCT-GGC-GGC-TAA tells the cell: start-alanine-argenine-
alanine-glycine-glycine-stop. This code would result in a protein with 
that sequence of five amino acids..

233
11.2 PROTEINS, FATS, AND NUCLEIC ACIDS
CHAPTER 11: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIVING SYSTEMS
DNA and reproduction
What
reproduction
does
When an organism reproduces, it must pass on the chemical 
information for how to create every single protein in the organism. 
This is an incredible amount of information considering how many 
proteins there are and how complex a protein is. 
Splitting the DNA
molecule
Fortunately, the DNA molecule is able to make exact replicas of itself. 
When a cell reproduces, enzymes split the DNA molecule down the 
center. Each half of the molecule contains a complementary code of 
nitrogen bases. Since guanine only pairs with cytosine and adenine 
only pairs with thymine, each half of the molecule contains the 
complete genetic information for how to make proteins.
Rebuilding
identical DNA
molecules
Other enzymes called polymerases move along the unzipped DNA 
molecule rebuilding the nitrogen bases on each side. Still more 
enzymes rebuild the sugar and phosphate backbone on top of the 
completed nitrogen base pairs. At the end of the process, there are two 
identical DNA molecules.
Error checking
Another set of enzymes compares the old and new DNA strands for 
errors and corrects them by replacing nitrogen bases where necessary.  
We believe DNA replication occurs with less than one error out of 
every billion base pairs. 
mutation - change in the 
sequence of base pairs in DNA 
that may be passed on to 
successive generations.
Mutations and 
evolution
Even with odds of 1 in a billion, 
over time, the sequence of bases 
in a DNA molecule does change 
through random replication errors. 
Radiation from the environment 
and other processes also change 
DNA. Changes in DNA are called 
mutations. Changes in DNA lead 
to new proteins, and changes in 
living organisms that are passed 
on in successive generations. This 
is the chemical basis for evolution.

Vitamins
Vitamins
Most of the chemicals required for life can be synthesized by your 
own body, like proteins. However, there are certain chemicals 
necessary for the chemistry of life that the human body does not 
make. Collectively, these are called vitamins and minerals. In 
addition to carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, your body must get  
vitamins and minerals from food.
Vitamin C
Ascorbic acid (Figure 11.12), also known as vitamin C, is required for 
synthesis of several important chemicals in your brain and nervous 
system. Vitamin C is also needed to synthesise compounds used in 
the transfer of energy within cells (ADP/ATP). Vitamin C must be 
supplied daily through food.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D includes several fat-soluble compounds known chemically 
as calciferols. Vitamin D is not a true vitamin since it can be 
synthesized by your skin when cholesterol reacts with ultraviolet 
light. However, sunscreens and clothes block UV rays from reaching 
the skin and can result in vitamin D deficiency. To help prevent this 
possibility, foods such as milk are being fortified with vitamin D2 or 
vitamin D3. A severe deficiency of vitamin D leads to softening of the 
bones called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. 
The B vitamins
The B vitamins include several compounds that must be obtained 
from food. The B vitamins often work together to bolster metabolism, 
maintain healthy skin and muscle tone, enhance immune and 
nervous system function, and promote cell growth and division, 
including that of the red blood cells that help prevent anemia. All      
B vitamins are water soluble, and are dispersed throughout the body 
and must be replenished daily, with any excess excreted in the urine.
Folate
Folate is another vitamin especially important during periods of 
rapid cell division and growth such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate 
is needed to make DNA and RNA. Both adults and children need 
folate to make normal red blood cells and prevent anemia.

Good Fats vs. Bad Fats
What is your favorite food? French fries, ice cream, cookies, 
maybe, or candy? Does just reading that make your mouth 
water? Many of us eat these tasty treats every now and then, 
but eating too much of high-fat foods can be bad for our 
health. What does “high-fat” actually mean, and are all fats 
bad for us?
The lowdown on fats
We need a reasonable amount of fat in our diets. Fat helps 
support cell function and helps our bodies absorb vitamins. 
But a diet too high in certain fats can lead to many health 
problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. 
High cholesterol is a leading risk factor for heart disease. It 
can cause the deposit of fatty buildups in our arteries called 
plaques. Plaques narrow the arteries and so reduce blood 
flow, a condition called atherosclerosis. 
Cholesterol-carrying compounds called lipoproteins play a 
key role in the development of atherosclerosis and heart 
disease. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport 
cholesterol from the liver to the rest of our body. When there 
is too much LDL cholesterol in the blood, it can begin to build 
up on the walls of the arteries. LDL cholesterol is called “bad 
cholesterol” because of this buildup. High-density 
lipoproteins (HDL) transport cholesterol from the blood back 
to the liver for removal. HDL cholesterol is less likely to be 
deposited in the arteries, and so is referred to as the “good 
cholesterol.”
A low-fat diet will help to reduce the risk for heart disease. 
But what truly affects our health is the type of fat and the 
total amount we eat.
Unsaturated, saturated, and trans fats
Based on their chemical structure, fats are either 
unsaturated or saturated. An unsaturated fat has two or 
more carbon atoms that are not bonded to hydrogen. In a 
saturated fat, all the carbon atoms have the maximum 
number of hydrogen atoms attached.    
Unsaturated fats, known as 
“good fats,” lower LDL and 
reduce the risk for heart disease. 
Unsaturated fats are liquid at 
room temperature and are found 
in olive and canola oils, avocados, 
and some nuts. Fatty fishes, such 
as salmon and tuna, are good 
sources of unsaturated fat. 
Saturated fats are referred to as “bad fats.” Our livers easily 
convert them to LDL cholesterol, which increases the risk for 
heart disease. 
Saturated fats 
are solid at room 
temperature and 
are found in 
whole-milk dairy 
products like 
cheese, cream, 
and butter, and 
also in meat and 
poultry. Coconut 
and palm oils are 
among plant 
foods that are high in saturated fats.

UNIT 4  MATTER AND CHANGE
Trans fatty acids, or 
trans fats, are included 
in the “bad fats” that 
raise LDL cholesterol 
levels. Food 
manufacturers produce 
trans fats by adding 
hydrogen to liquid 
vegetable oils, a process 
known as hydrogenation. 
The more hydrogenated 
the oil, the harder it is at room temperature. For example, a 
tub of spreadable margarine is less hydrogenated than a 
stick of margarine. Trans fats are found in most fried foods 
and in many processed foods, such as cakes and cookies.
The new food pyramid
For over 100 years, the 
U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) has 
made recommendations 
on the types and 
amounts of food we 
should eat. Recently, the 
USDA developed 
“MyPyramid,” an 
interactive food 
guidance system. MyPyramid incorporates recommendations 
from the USDA’s 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 
Using the USDA website (www.MyPyramid.gov), and 
entering their age, gender, and activity level, consumers can 
design their own healthy food plans. 
The MyPyramid symbol encourages people to personalize 
their food choices and to incorporate daily physical activity 
in their lives. In terms of fat intake, the USDA recommends 
low-fat or fat-free milk products, that less than 10 percent of 
calories come from saturated fats, and that trans fats be kept 
to a minimum. Most fats we eat should come from 
unsaturated sources, such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. 
Changes on food labels
By Jan. 1, 2006, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) is requiring 
that food labels list trans fats. This 
will be in addition to the listing of 
overall fat, saturated fat, and 
cholesterol. The FDA hopes that 
the more detailed label will give 
consumers a complete picture of 
the foods they buy - and help them 
make healthier food choices and 
ultimately live healthier lives.   
Questions: 
1. Why are low-density lipoproteins (LDL) called “bad 
cholesterol” and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) called 
“good cholesterol”?
2. How do unsaturated, saturated, and trans fats affect LDL 
and HDL levels?
3. What changes are being made to food labels by Jan. 1, 
2006, and why?

The Scoop on Nutrition Labels
All packaged foods are required to contain nutrition labels to 
help consumers choose healthy foods. A nutrition label 
shows the amount of calories, fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, 
protein, and several vitamins and minerals in one serving of 
the food.   
The exact amount of each nutrient a person needs depends 
on gender, age, activity level, and weight. An average female 
teenager should consume approximately 2200 calories and 
not more than 73 grams of fat per day. A male should 
consume 2800 calories and not more than 93 grams of fat. 
Protein requirements depend on body mass and amount of 
physical activity. Teenagers need between 1 and 1.5 grams of 
protein per kilogram of body mass. 
Materials:
Nutrition labels from food packages or from the internet

Distance, Time, and Speed
Do you know which animal is the fastest? You may have heard 
that the cheetah is the fastest land animal. A cheetah is able to 
run at a top speed of 70 mph (113 kph). But the cheetah is not 
the fastest animal on Earth. Scientists have measured the 
speeds of peregrine falcons to be over 200 mph (332 kph)! 
Falcons reach this top speed when diving through the air toward 
prey on the ground. In comparison, the fastest human can reach 
a speed of only 23 mph (37 kph) while running over a short 
distance. People are able to use their own power to move much 
more quickly with a bicycle. The world record speed of a cyclist is 
81 mph (130 kph). This record was reached by a person on a 
recumbent bicycle in which the rider sits with his or her legs 
stretched in front of the body rather than below. Recumbent 
bicycles are twice as fast as upright bicycles. One reason is that 
they are more aerodynamic. Another reason is pedaling a 
recumbent bicycle requires different leg muscles than pedaling 
an upright bicycle. These muscles are stronger and allow the 
rider to pedal with more force.

12.1 Distance, Direction, and Position
If asked how far you live from your school, you may say the distance is 5 miles or 
8 kilometers. But if you asked where your house is located compared to the school, you 
would probably give a different answer. To describe the exact location or position, you 
must specify a direction as well as a distance. 
Direction
Distance
Distance is the amount of space between two points. A distance 
measurement does not include information about the direction you 
would have to travel to get from one point to the next. If you say you 
live a distance of one mile from school, you could mean anywhere on 
the circle of points shown in Figure 12.1. 
Different ways to
give directions
To find the exact location of your house, you must give both the 
distance and the direction from school. There are several ways of 
specifying direction. You might tell someone to turn right in front of 
the school, go 4 miles on Main Street, turn left on 7th Avenue, go 3 
miles, and stop at 623 7th Avenue, and then walk left to your front 
door. The direction words left and right, along with up and down, are 
used in everyday life because they are simple to follow. You could also 
give directions to your house using the compass directions north, 
south, east, and west. 
Navigation
Compass directions are printed on maps and used by ships and 
planes for navigation. The four perpindicular directions are north, 
south, east, and west. Directions in between these four are given with 
angles relative to one of the four principle directions.  For example, a 
pilot flying from New York to Boston must direct the plane at an 
angle of 36 degrees north of east (Figure 12.2). This angle is 
measured counter-clockwise from east, which corresponds to the way 
angles are given in math. This same direction could also be given as 
54 degrees east of north. Most compasses are labeled in degrees 
clockwise from north.

245
12.1 DISTANCE, DIRECTION, AND POSITION
CHAPTER 12: DISTANCE, TIME, AND SPEED
Position
Location
compared to an
origin
An object’s position is its location at one instant in time. A position is 
always given compared to an origin. The origin is a fixed reference 
point. When giving directions to your house from school, the school is 
the origin. The position of your house might be 1 mile north of school. 
Positive and
negative
numbers
Both positive and negative numbers are used to describe position. A 
positive position usually means in front of, to the right of, or above the 
origin. A negative position usually means behind, to the left of, or 
below the origin. It is important to define the positive and negative 
directions if you are doing an experiment. 
Doing
experiments
If an object is moving in a line, its position is usually given in meters 
away from its starting point. For example, suppose you are doing an 
experiment with a car on a track. It is easiest to define the origin at 
the position where the car starts (Figure 12.3).
Using a number
line
A number line can be used to think about position in straight-line 
motion. The origin is at zero. If you start at the origin and move 3 
meters to the right, your position is +3 meters. If you then move 5 
meters to the left, your position is -2 meters. You can add each change 
in position to calculate your final position.

Motion in a line,
on a plane, and in
space
If an object can only move in a line, its motion is called one-
dimensional. Motion on a flat surface (a plane) is two-dimensional. 
How you describe an object’s position depends on whether you are 
studying its motion in one or two dimensions. A single number fully 
describes position in one dimension. Two numbers are needed to 
describe position in two dimensions (Figure 12.4). 
Coordinates
describe position
Two number lines at right angles to each other are used to show 
position in two dimensions. The two number lines make up what is 
called an x-y plane. Two numbers, called coordinates, are used to 
describe the position. The x-coordinate describes the position to the 
left/right or east/west. The y-coordinate describes the position 
up/down or north/south. 
You must define
an origin
You can describe the position of your house compared to your school 
on an x-y plane. Let your school be the origin. It is convenient to 
define the positive x-direction as east and the positive y-direction as 
north.Your school is 4 miles east and 3 miles north. The coordinates 
for this position are (+4 miles, +3 miles).

speed - the distance an object 
travels divided by the time it takes.
constant speed - speed of an 
object that travels the same 
distance each second.
We depend on cars, buses, trains, 
and planes to get us from place to 
place at high speeds. But people 
living 200 years ago could not 
travel so easily. Five miles per 
hour is about what a horse can 
comfortably go for a long distance. 
Compare the lives of people today 
with those of people living 200 
years ago. Disucss the ways being 
able to travel at speeds greater 
than ten miles per hour has 
changed our everyday lives.
12.2 Speed
Speed is the most common measurement used to describe the motion of objects. Saying a 
race car, runner, or plane is “fast” is not enough to accurately describe its speed. In this 
section, you will learn a precise definition of speed. Once you know an object’s speed, you 
can figure out how far it can go in a certain amount of time. Or you can predict how long 
it will take to get somewhere.
Speed 
An example of
speed
Imagine two bicycles moving along the road at different speeds. The 
picture below shows the position of each at one second intervals. The 
fast bicycle (the bottom one) moves three times the speed of the slow 
one. The fast bicycle moves 3 meters each second, while the slow 
bicycle moves only 1 meter each second. 
Speed is distance
divided by time
The speed of a bicycle is the distance it travels divided by the time it 
takes. At 1 m/s, a bicycle travels one meter each second. At 3 m/s, it 
travels three meters each second. Both bicycles in the diagram are 
moving at constant speed. Constant speed means the same distance 
is traveled every second. The snapshots are evenly spaced, so you 
know the distance traveled by each bicycle is the same each second.

249
12.2 SPEED
CHAPTER 12: DISTANCE, TIME, AND SPEED
Velocity
 Direction
Speed tells you how fast something is moving. Sometimes it is also 
important to know the direction an object is moving. An air traffic 
controller must keep track of all the planes flying in an area. 
Information about the direction each is headed is as important as 
knowing the speed. 
Velocity is speed
with direction
Speed with direction is called velocity. Like position, the compass 
headings north, south, east, and west are often used for the velocity of 
planes and ships. The words up, down, left, and right can also be used 
to describe velocity. 
Comparing
velocities
Two objects with the same velocity must have the same speed and 
must be moving in the same direction. Both planes in the diagram 
above have a speed of 600 km/h. Plane A has a velocity of 600 km/h 
north, and plane B has a velocity of 600 km/h west. The planes are 
moving at the same speed, but their velocities are different. 
Constant velocity
An object with constant velocity has both constant speed and constant 
direction. A plane flying with a constant velocity of 600 km/h north 
keeps moving toward the north. The plane can only do this if it moves 
in a straight line. Any object with constant velocity must move in a 
straight line (Figure 12.5). A car going around a bend at a constant 30 
mph does not have a constant velocity because its direction is 
changing (Figure 12.6).

Figure 12.7: A driving trip with an 
average speed of 100 km/h
average speed - the total 
distance divided by the total time 
for a trip.
Calculating speed
Speed is distance
divided by time
Speed is a measure of the distance traveled in a given amount of time. 
You calculate speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time 
taken. For example, if you drive 150 kilometers in 1.5 hours, then the 
speed of the car is 150 kilometers divided by 1.5 hours or 100 
kilometers per hour (Figure 12.7). The speed found by dividing the 
total distance by the total time is the average speed. A car speeds 
up and slows down during a trip as it moves up and down hills, gets 
stuck in traffic, and reaches intersections. When talking about speed, 
we usually mean the average speed over a certain time period. 
What does “per”
mean?
The word “per” means “for every” or “for each.” The speed of 100 
kilometers per hour is short for saying 100 kilometers for each hour. 
You can also think of “per” as meaning “divided by.” The quantity 
before the word per is divided by the quantity after it. For example, 
150 kilometers divided by 1.5 hours (or per every 1.5 hours) equals 
100 miles per hour.
Units for speed
Since speed is a ratio of distance over time, the units for speed are a 
ratio of distance units over time units. In the metric system, distance 
is measured in centimeters, meters, or kilometers. If distance is in 
kilometers and time in hours, then speed is expressed in kilometers 
per hour (km/h). Other metric units for speed are centimeters per 
second (cm/s) and meters per second (m/s). Speed is also commonly 
expressed in miles per hour (mph). Table 12.1 shows different units 
commonly used for speed.

CHAPTER 12: DISTANCE, TIME, AND SPEED
Relationships between distance, speed, and time
Mixing up
distance, speed,
and time
A common type of question in physics is: “How far do you go if you 
drive for two hours at a speed of 100 km/h?” You know how to get 
speed from time and distance. How do you get distance from speed and 
time? The answer is the reason mathematics is the language of 
physics. An equation can be used to calculate speed, distance, or time 
if two of the three values are known. 
Calculating
speed
Let the letter the letter d stand for “distance traveled” and the letter t 
stand for “time taken.” The letter v is used to represent “speed” 
because it refers to the word velocity. You follow the same steps 
whether you are calculating speed or velocity. The only difference is 
that when giving an object’s velocity, you must include the direction of 
its motion in addition to the speed. 
There are three ways to arrange the variables that relate distance, 
time, and speed. You should be able to work out how to get any one of 
the three variables if you know the other two (Figure 12.8).
Using formulas

12.3 Graphs of Motion
Motion graphs are an important tool used to show the relationships between position, 
speed, and time. For example, meteorologists use graphs to show the motion of 
hurricanes and other storms. A graph can show the location and speed of a storm at 
different points in time. The graph can be used to help predict the path of a storm and the 
time when it will reach a certain location. In this section, you will learn how to make and 
use graphs of position versus time and speed versus time to describe the motion of 
different objects.
Position vs. time graphs
Recording data
Suppose you are helping a friend who is training for a track meet. She 
wants to know if she is running at constant speed during a section of 
the race. You mark the track in 50-meter increments and measure her 
time at each position during a practice run. The data for your 
experiment is shown in Figure 12.9. 
Calculating
speed
The data shows that your friend took 10 seconds to run each 50-meter 
segment. Because the time was the same for each segment, you know 
her speed was the same for each segment. You can use the formula 
v=d/t to calculate the speed. Dividing 50 meters by 10 seconds results 
in a speed of 5 meters per second. 
Graphing the
data
You make a graph of the data by plotting the four points on graph 
paper and connecting them with a smooth line. Notice that when 
moving from each data point to the next, the graph goes over 10 
seconds and up 50 meters. This causes the points to fall exactly in a 
straight line. A position vs. time graph that is a straight line always 
means the object moves the same distance during each time period. An 
object moving at a constant speed always creates a position vs. time 
graph that is a straight line.

position vs. time graph for a runner.

Comparing
graphs
You can use position vs. time graphs to compare the motion of 
different objects. Figure 12.10 shows the position vs. time graph for 
two people running along a 600-meter section of a jogging path. Both 
runners start at the beginning of the path (the origin) at the same 
time. Runner A takes 100 seconds to cover 600 meters, and runner B 
takes 150 seconds. Using v=d/t, runner A’s speed is 6 m/s and runner 
B’s speed is 4 m/s. You can see that runner A’s speed is faster by 
looking at the two lines on the graph. Runner A’s line is steeper. A 
steeper line on a position vs. time graph means a faster speed. 
A steeper line on a position vs. time graph 
means a faster speed. 
Calculating slope
The steepness of a line is measured by finding its slope. The slope of 
a line is the ratio of the “rise” (vertical change) to the “run” 
(horizontal change). The diagram below shows you how to calculate 
the slope of a line. The rise is equal to the height of the triangle. The 
run is equal to the length along the base of the triangle. Here, the x-
values represent time and the y-values represent position. The slope 
of a position versus time graph is therefore a distance divided by a 
time, which equals speed. The units for the speed are the units for the 
rise (meters) divided by the units for the run (seconds) or meters per 
second.

CHAPTER 12: DISTANCE, TIME, AND SPEED
Speed vs. time graphs
Constant speed
on a speed vs.
time graph
The speed versus time graph has speed on the y-axis and time on the 
x-axis. The graph in Figure 12.11 shows the speed versus time for a 
ball rolling at constant speed on a level floor. On a speed vs. time 
graph, constant speed is shown with a straight horizontal line. If you 
look at the speed on the y-axis, you see that the ball is moving at 1 m/s 
for the entire 10 seconds. Figure 12.12 is the position versus time 
graph for the ball. Both of the graphs show the exact same motion. If 
you calculate the slope of the lower graph, you will find that it is 1 m/s, 
the same as the speed in Figure 12.11. 
Calculating
distance
A speed versus time graph also can be used to find the distance the 
object has traveled. Remember, distance is equal to the speed 
multiplied by the time. Suppose we draw a rectangle on the speed 
versus time graph between the x - axis and the line showing the speed. 
The area of the rectangle (shown below) is equal to its length times its 
height. On the graph, the length is equal to the time and the height is 
equal to the speed. Therefore, the area of the graph is the speed 
multiplied by the time. This is the distance the ball traveled.

The speed vs. time graph for changing motion
Speeding up and
slowing down
The graphs you have been learning about until now have all shown 
motion at a constant speed. But objects rarely move at the same 
speed for a long period of time. A speed vs. time graph is useful for 
showing the motion of an object that is speeding up or slowing down. 
If a speed vs. time graph slopes up, then the speed is increasing. If it 
slopes down, then the speed is decreasing. If the graph is horizontal, 
then the object is moving at a constant speed. 
The graphs in Figure 12.13 show the motion of three different cars for 
10 seconds. Each begins at a speed of 20 m/s. The first car moves at a 
constant 20 m/s for the entire 5 seconds. The second car speeds up 
from 20 m/s to 30 m/s. The third car slows down from 20 m/s to 
10 m/s.

Roller Coasters: The Physics Behind the Thrills 
The first roller coaster in the United States was built in 1884 
at Coney Island, in Brooklyn, N.Y. A nickel bought you a 
one-minute ride and patrons have been paying for that thrill 
ever since. Are you among the thrill seekers?
That first roller coaster was all wood and ran in a straight 
line. Even if you have not yet ridden your first roller coaster, 
you know modern roller coasters have come a long way (and 
can be found far from Coney Island). Roller coasters are now 
made of wood or steel, and the tracks include a variety of 
twists and turns and loops and drops that make the ride 
scary and thrilling.
The keys to the thrill factor are velocity and acceleration. 
Velocity is the rate at which the position of an object—say, a 
roller coaster car—changes. Acceleration is the rate at which 
the velocity of an object changes. The thrill of the ride comes 
from the sudden accelerations. The fun begins at the top of 
the first peak on the track; that is where velocity and 
acceleration get their start.
Materials make a difference 
Not so long ago, almost every roller coaster was still made of 
wood. But wood has limitations that made those coasters 
less popular once steel roller coasters made their debut. 
Steel coasters have replaced most of the wooden ones.
The two offer quite different riding experiences. A wooden 
coaster is often a rougher and “wilder” ride. This is because 
wood tends to be less rigid than steel. A wooden coaster’s 
tracks usually move anywhere from a few inches to a few 
feet in response to the force of the cars rolling on the rails. 
The track is designed to do this; its swaying makes for a 
frightening ride, which is what riders want, don’t they?
Chapter 12 Connection

259
UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
If you are a coaster enthusiast, you know that some wooden 
frames include inversions. An inversion is when the roller 
coaster’s cars are upside down. And some cars fly through 
steeply banked (though not inverted) curves called 
“overbanked” turns. Most wooden tracks cannot support 
inversions, and overbanked turns don’t work as well in wood. 
On wooden coasters, the motion is mainly up and down. That 
is more than enough for designers to still create thrilling 
wood roller coasters for big amusement parks.
How a roller coaster makes its thrills
While they have are clearly different, wooden and steel roller 
coasters have even more in common. They both rely on rapid 
changes in velocity to provide excitement. When your 
velocity changes rapidly your body can feel weightless, like 
you are falling. You can feel sudden sideways forces, like 
trying to turn a corner too fast in a car. You can even feel 
pressed into your seat with twice your normal weight. The 
challenge to a roller coaster designer is to create rapid 
changes in velocity that also keep the rider safe!
Gravity applies a constant downward force on a roller 
coaster car. The anticipation builds on the first big hill as the 
motor drags the car slowly up to the top. Upon reaching the 
top, the car picks up speed as it seems to fall down the first 
big hill. The first hill is usually straight so the car gains 
velocity by increasing its speed. This is where you feel 
weightless, like you are falling because, you are falling!
The next change in velocity comes in the first turn. The 
coaster’s tracks constrain the car so it can only move along 
the track. A rapid change in the car’s velocity vector is 
created by forcing the car to make a sharp turn at high 
speed. This is where you feel thrown to one side of the car or 
get squashed against your fellow thrill-seekers. The speed of 
the roller coaster car stays about the same through the turn. 
The change in velocity is in direction, not in speed.
Some roller coasters feature corkscrew-like tracks that whip 
the car through a combination of vertical and turning motion 
that puts everyone upside down. Here is where you feel 
pressed into your seat with more than your usual weight. 
This feeling is created by changing the direction of the 
velocity vector in the vertical direction, when the car curves 
over as it speeds through the corkscrew. Because of the tight 
turns and high speeds, corkscrew tracks must be extremely 
strong. Wooden roller coasters could not have supported a 
corkscrew at the speeds of modern steel coasters.
Most roller coasters rely on the potential energy from the 
first big hill. This is converted to kinetic energy in the 
motion of the car. As the ride progresses, friction slows the 
car down and the speed gets lower. The second and third 
hills are lower than the first because the car does not have 
enough energy to climb a bigger hill without additional 
power.
If you ever wondered how roller coasters have gotten bigger 
and bigger as new designs have been introduced, now you 
know. Simple physics!
Questions: 
1. What is velocity?
2. How does a roller coaster create the sensations of falling, 
and being thrown around?
3. How does a roller coaster car move without an engine 
powering it?
4. Why do you think the first hill in a roller coaster’s design is the 
highest?

 How fast are you?
Speed is how fast 
something moves in 
relation to a reference 
point without regard to 
the direction. Speed is 
found by dividing the 
distance traveled by the 
total time the object has 
traveled. An object can 
travel at a constant rate 
or the speed may vary.
When speed varies during a trip, you can find the average 
speed for the entire trip. In this activity you and a partner 
will each calculate your average speed in different units. 
Materials
Tape measure, meterstick, or ruler
Stopwatch or watch with a second hand
Pieces of tape
What you will do
1. Decide how you and your partner will be moving. You can 
walk, run, roll, or move in any other way you choose. 
2. Find an open area outside, in a hallway, or in another 
location where you can do this activity.
3. Mark your starting point (origin) with a piece of tape.
4. Measure at least five evenly spaced positions in meters 
along the path you are going to follow. Mark these 
positions with tape. For example, if you are running 
60 meters, place a piece of tape at the starting point and 
at every 10 meters. If you are crawling only 5 meters, 
mark off every 1 meter.
5. Start at the origin and move along the length of your 
path. Your partner will start the timer once you start 
moving. Your partner should record the time for each 
marked position. For example at the origin time is zero. 
At the 1-meter mark the time might be 2 seconds, at the 
2-meter mark the time might be 4 seconds and so on. 
6. Record your data in a table like this:
7. Switch roles and repeat the activity with the other person 
moving. Record your data in the table.
8. Make a position vs. time graph to show each person’s 
motion. Put both sets of data on the same graph. It might 
be helpful to use two different colors to plot the points. 
Applying your knowledge
a. Explain how you can use your graph to figure out who 
had the faster average speed.
b. Explain how you can use your data table to figure out 
who had the faster average speed. 
c. Look at each person’s line on the graph. How can you use 
the graph to tell whether you moved at a constant speed? 
Did you move at a constant speed? Did your partner?
d. Calculate each person’s average speed in meters per 
second and in centimeters per second.

Forces
On May 27, 1931, a train called Empire Builder encountered the 
amazing force of a tornado as it moved across Minnesota. The 
tornado’s force was so great that as the train moved along the 
track at 60 miles per hour, five of its 60-ton cars where lifted 
from the rails! One car was lifted and thrown 80 feet away into a 
ditch. Moving heavy railroad cars requires a tremendous 
amount of force.
Forces are created and applied every time anything moves. 
Forces such as weight are even present when things are not 
moving. Your body uses forces every moment of your life from 
the beating of your heart to walking up stairs. Understanding 
how forces are created and described is fundamental to 
understanding nature. Read this chapter to learn more about 
how forces are created, measured, described, and used in daily 
life.

2. How are forces measured?. 
3. What is friction, and is friction ever useful?

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Figure 13.1: All forces in the 
universe come from only four elementary 
forces.
13.1 Forces
We first introduced the idea of force in Chapter 2. Since force is such an important 
concept, this whole chapter is about forces, where they come from, how they are 
measured, and how they are added and subtracted.
The cause of forces
What forces are
A force is a push or pull, or any action that has the ability to change 
motion. The key word here is action, force is an action. You need force 
to start things moving and also to make any change to an object’s 
motion once it is moving. Forces can be used to increase or decrease 
the speed of an object, or to change the direction in which an object is 
moving.
How are forces
created?
Forces are created in many different ways. For example, your 
muscles create force when you swing a tennis racket. Earth’s gravity 
creates a force called weight that pulls on everything around you. On 
a windy day, the movement of air can create forces. Each of these 
actions can create force because they all can change an object’s 
motion.
The four
elementary
forces
Fundamentally, forces come from the interaction between atoms and 
energy. Just as a few elements can make millions of kinds of matter, 
all of the forces we know of in the universe come from four 
elementary forces. The in Figure 13.1 summarizes the four 
elementary forces. You met them before when we learned about the 
atom and will meet them again when we learn about astronomy.

CHAPTER 13: FORCES
Units of force
Pounds
If you are mailing a package at the post office, how does the clerk 
know how much to charge you? The package is placed on a scale and 
you are charged based on the package’s weight. For example, the scale 
shows that the package weighs 5 pounds. The pound is a unit of force 
commonly used in the United States. When you measure weight in 
pounds on a scale, you are measuring the force of gravity acting on the 
object (Figure 2.3).
The origin of the
pound
The pound measurement of force is based on the Roman unit libra, 
which means “balance” and is the source for pound’s abbreviation, “lb.” 
The word “pound” comes from the Latin word pondus, which means 
“weight.” The definition of a pound has varied over time and from 
country to country. 
Newtons
Although the pound is commonly used to express force, scientists 
prefer to use the newton. The newton (N) is the metric unit of force. 
The newton is defined by how much a force can change the motion of 
an object. A force of one newton is the exact amount of force needed to 
cause a mass of one kilogram to speed up by one m/sec each second 
(Figure 13.2). We call the unit of force the newton because force in the 
metric system is defined by Newton’s laws. The newton is a useful way 
to measure force because it connects force directly to its effect on mass 
and speed. 
Converting
newtons and
pounds
The newton is a smaller unit of force than the pound. One pound of 
force equals 4.48 newtons. How much would a 100-pound person 
weigh in newtons? Recall that 1 pound = 4.48 newtons. Therefore, a 
100-pound person weighs 448 newtons.

weighs 98 newtons on Earth but only 
16 newtons on the moon.
Gravity and weight
Gravity’s force
depends on mass
The force of gravity on an object is called weight. At Earth’s surface, 
gravity exerts a force of 9.8 N on every kilogram of mass. That means 
a 1-kilogram mass has a weight of 9.8 N, a two-kilogram mass has a 
weight of 19.6 N, and so on. On Earth’s surface, the weight of any 
object is its mass multiplied by 9.8 N/kg. Because weight is a force, it 
is measured in units of force such as newtons and pounds.
Weight and mass
are not the same
thing
We all tend to use the terms weight and mass interchangeably. 
However, in science weight and mass are not the same thing. In fact, 
weight is caused by nearby mass. You have weight because the huge 
mass of Earth is right next to you. It is easy to confuse mass and 
weight because heavy objects (more weight) have lots of mass and 
light objects (less weight) have little mass. Always remember the 
difference when doing physics. Mass is a fundamental property of an 
object measured in kilograms (kg). Weight is a force measured in 
newtons (N) that depends on mass and gravity. 
Mass and weight are not the same thing!
Weight is less on
the moon
A 10-kilogram rock has a mass of 10 kilograms no matter where it is 
in the universe. A 10-kilogram rock’s weight however, can vary 
greatly depending on where it is. On Earth, the rock weighs 98 
newtons. But on the moon, where g = 1.6 N/kg, it only weighs 16 
newtons (Figure 13.3)!

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Figure 13.5: There are many types of 
friction.
friction - a force that resists the 
motion of objects or surfaces.
Friction
What is friction?
Friction is a force that resists the motion of objects or surfaces. 
Friction can act when an object is moving or when it is at rest. You 
feel the effects of friction when you swim, ride in a car, walk, and 
even when you sit in a chair. Many kinds of friction exist and 
Figure 13.5 shows some common examples. 
The cause of
friction
If you looked at a piece of wood, plastic, 
or paper through a powerful 
microscope, you would see tiny hills 
and valleys on the surface. As surfaces 
slide (or try to slide) across each other, 
the hills and valleys grind against each 
other and cause friction. Contact 
between the surfaces can cause the 
tiny bumps to change shape or wear 
away. If you rub sandpaper on a piece of wood, friction affects the 
wood’s surface and makes it either smoother (bumps wear away) or 
rougher (they change shape).
Two surfaces are
involved
Friction depends on both of the surfaces in contact. The force of 
friction on a rubber hockey puck is very small when it is sliding on 
ice. But the same hockey puck sliding on a piece of sandpaper feels a 
large friction force. When the hockey puck slides on ice, a thin layer of 
water between the rubber and the ice allows the puck to slide easily. 
Water and other liquids such as oil can greatly reduce the friction 
between surfaces.   

269
13.1 FORCES
CHAPTER 13: FORCES
Identifying friction forces
Direction of the
friction force
Friction is a force, measured in newtons just like any other force. You 
draw the force of friction with a force vector. To figure out the 
direction of friction, always remember that friction is a resistive force. 
The force of friction acting on a surface always points opposite the 
direction of motion of that surface. Imagine pushing a heavybox across 
the floor (Figure 13.6). If you push to the right, the sliding friction acts 
to the left on the surface of the box touching the floor. If you push the 
box to the left, the force of sliding friction acts to the right. This is 
what we mean by saying friction resists motion.
Static friction
Static friction keeps an object at rest from moving. Imagine trying to 
push a heavy box with a small force. The box stays at rest because the 
static friction force acts against your force. If the box does not move, 
the friction force is the same strength as your force, so the net force is 
zero. As you increase the strength of your push, the static friction also 
increases. Eventually your force becomes stronger than the maximum 
static friction force and the box starts to move (Figure 13.6). The force 
of static friction balances your force up to a limit. The limit of the 
friction force depends on the types of surfaces and the weight of the 
object you are pushing. 
Sliding friction
Sliding friction is a force that resists the motion of an object moving 
across a surface. If you push a box across the floor toward the right, 
sliding friction acts toward the left. If you stop pushing the box, sliding 
friction keeps acting as long as the box is moving. Without your force 
acting, sliding friction slows the box to a stop. 
Comparing static
and sliding
friction
How does sliding friction compare with static friction? If you have ever 
tried to move a heavy sofa or refrigerator, you probably know the 
answer. It is harder to get something moving than it is to keep it 
moving. The reason is that static friction is greater than sliding 
friction for almost all combinations of surfaces. 
Figure 13.6: The direction of friction is 
opposite the direction the box is pushed.
static friction - the friction force 
that resists the motion between 
two surfaces that are not moving.
sliding friction - the friction 
force that resists the motion of an 
object moving across a surface.

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Figure 13.7: Friction increases greatly 
when a brick is placed on the paper.
A model for friction
Different
amounts of
friction
The amount of friction that exists when a box is pushed across a 
smooth floor is very different from when it is pushed across a carpet. 
The friction between two surfaces depends on the types of materials, 
degrees of roughness, how clean they are, and other factors. Even the 
friction between two identical surfaces changes as the surfaces are 
polished by sliding across each other. No one model or formula can 
accurately describe the many processes that create friction. Even so, 
some simple models are useful.
An example
Suppose you use a spring scale pull a piece of paper across a table. It 
is easy to pull the paper because the friction force is so small. The 
paper slides smoothly, and the scale measures a very small force. Do 
you believe the friction force between the paper and the table is a 
value that cannot be changed? How might you test this question?
Friction and the
force between
surfaces
Suppose you place a brick on the piece of paper (Figure 13.7). The 
paper becomes much harder to slide. You must pull with a greater 
force to keep the paper moving. The two surfaces in contact are still 
the paper and the tabletop, so why does the brick have an effect? The 
brick causes the paper to press harder into the table’s surface. The 
tiny hills and valleys in the paper and in the tabletop are pressed 
together with a much greater force, so the friction increases. 
The greater the force squeezing two surfaces 
together, the greater the friction force. 
Friction is often
proportional to
weight
The friction force between two smooth, hard surfaces is 
approximately proportional to the perpindicular (normal) force the 
surfaces exert on each other. The greater the force squeezing the two 
surfaces together, the greater the friction force. Consider sliding a 
heavy box across a floor. The force between the bottom of the box and 
the floor is the weight of the box. Therefore, the force of friction is 
proportional to the weight of the box. If the weight doubles, the force 
of friction also doubles. 

271
13.1 FORCES
CHAPTER 13: FORCES
Reducing the force of friction 
All surfaces
experience some
friction
Any motion where surfaces move across each other or through air or 
water always causes some friction. Unless a force is constantly 
applied, friction will slow all motion to a stop eventually. For example, 
bicycles have low friction, but even the best bicycle slows down if you 
coast on a level road. It is impossible to completely get rid of friction, 
but it can be reduced.
Lubricants
reduce friction in
machines
Putting a liquid such as oil between two sliding surfaces keeps them 
from touching each other. The tiny hills and valleys don’t become 
locked together, so the friction is less. The liquid also keeps them from 
wearing away quickly. You add oil to a car’s engine so that the pistons 
will slide back and forth with less friction. Even water can be used as 
to reduce friction between objects if they are not too hot.   
Ball bearings
Ball bearings reduce friction on spinning objects (Figure 13.8). Ball 
bearings change sliding motion into rolling motion, which has much 
less friction. For example, a metal shaft rotating in a hole rubs and 
generates a great amount of friction. Ball bearings that go between 
the shaft and the inside surface of the hole allow it to spin more easily. 
The shaft rolls on the bearings instead of rubbing against the walls of 
the hole. Well-oiled bearings rotate easily and greatly reduce friction.
Magnetic
levitation
Another method of decreasing friction is to separate the two surfaces 
with a cushion of air. A hovercraft floats on a cushion of air created by 
a large fan. Magnetic forces can also be used to separate surfaces. A 
magnetically levitated (or maglev) train uses magnets that run on 
electricity to float on the track once the train is moving (Figure 13.9). 
There is no contact between train and track, so there is far less friction 
than with a standard train on tracks. The ride is smoother, so maglev 
trains can move at very fast speeds. Maglev trains are not yet in wide 
use because they are much more expensive to build than regular 
trains. They may become much more popular in the future.
Figure 13.8: The friction between a 
shaft (the long pole in the picture) and an 
outer part of a machine produces a lot of heat. 
Friction can be reduced by placing ball 
bearings between the shaft and the outer part.
Figure 13.9: With a maglev train, there 
is no contact between the moving train and 
the rail — and thus little friction.

Figure 13.10: Grooved tire treads allow 
space for water to be channeled away from 
the road-tire contact point, allowing for more 
friction in wet conditions.
Figure 13.11: Friction is what makes 
nails hard to pull out and gives them the 
strength to hold things together.
Using friction
Friction is useful
for brakes and
tires
There are many times when friction is very useful. For example, the 
brakes on a bicycle create friction between two rubber brake pads and 
the rim of the wheel. Friction between the brake pads and the rim 
makes the bicycle slow down or stop. Friction is also needed to make 
a bicycle go. Without friction, the bicycle’s tires would not grip the 
road. 
Weather
condition
tires
Friction is also important to anyone driving a car. Rain and snow act 
like a cushion that separates a car’s tires from the road. As a tire rolls 
over a wet road, the rubber squeezes the water out of the way. This 
causes there to be good contact between rubber and road surface. Tire 
treads have grooves that allow space for water to be channeled away 
where the tire touches the road (Figure 13.10). Special groove 
patterns, along with tiny slits, have been used on snow tires to 
increase traction in snow. These tires keep snow from getting packed 
into the treads. Tires can also slightly change shape to grip the 
uneven surface of a snow-covered road.
Nails
Friction is the force that keeps nails in place (Figure 13.11). The 
material the nail is hammered into, such as wood, pushes against the 
nail from all sides. Each hit of the hammer pushes the nail deeper 
into the wood, increasing the length of the nail being compressed. The 
strong compression force creates a large friction force and holds the 
nail in place.
Cleated shoes
Shoes are designed to increase the friction 
between their soles and the ground. Many 
types of athletes, including football and 
soccer players, wear shoes with cleats that 
increase friction. Cleats are like teeth on 
the bottom of the shoe that dig into the 
ground. Players wearing cleats can apply 
much greater forces against the ground to 
help them move and to keep from slipping.

13.2 Addition of Forces and Equilibrium
50 newtons would be a good description of the strength of a force. But what about the 
direction? The direction of a force is also important. This is especially true when forces 
are added together. Most real situations involve more than one force acting at a time, so 
adding forces is necessary to understand what is going on. In this section you will learn 
that force is a vector. A vector is a quantity that includes information about both size 
(strength) and direction
Vectors
When a quantity
and a unit are
sufficient
Some things in science can be completely described by a quantity and 
a unit. Temperature is a good example of this. If you are sick and use 
a thermometer to find out your temperature, it might show 101°F. 
The “quantity” of your temperature is 101, and degrees Fahrenheit is 
the unit of measurement. The value of 101°F is a complete 
description of the temperature because you do not need any more 
information.Length, time, and speed are also quantities that can be 
completely described with a single number and a unit.   
Vectors have
direction
Sometimes a single number does not include enough information to 
describe a measurement. When giving someone directions to your 
house, you must include both the distance and the direction. The 
information “two kilometers north” is an example of a vector. A 
vector is a quantity that includes both a  magnitude and a direction. 
Other examples of vectors are velocity, acceleration, and force.

CHAPTER 13: FORCES
The force vector
What is a force
vector?
A force vector has units of newtons, just like all forces. In addition, the 
force vector also includes enough information to tell the direction of 
the force. You can describe a force vector’s direction in words, such as 
5 newtons north or 2 newtons down. Or you can use an arrow to draw 
the force vector in graph form.
Using positive
and negative
numbers
Positive and negative numbers indicate opposite directions. For 
example, suppose a person pushes with a force of 10 newtons to the 
right (Figure 13.13). The force vector is + 10 N. A person pushing with 
the same force to the left would create a force vector of - 10 N. The 
negative sign indicates the -10 N force is in the opposite direction from 
the + 10 N force. We usually choose positive values to represent forces 
directed up, to the right, East or North.
Drawing a force
vector
It is sometimes helpful to show the strength and direction of a force 
vector as an arrow on a graph. The length of the arrow represents the 
strength of the force. The arrow points in the direction of the force. 
The x- and y-axes show the strength of the force in the x and y 
directions.
Scale
When drawing a force vector, you must choose a scale. For example, if 
you are drawing a vector showing a force of 5 N pointing straight up 
(y-direction) you might use a scale of 1 cm = 1 N. You would draw the 
arrow five centimeters long pointing along the y-direction on your 
paper (Figure 13.14). A 5 N horizontal force would be drawn starting 
with a 5 cm line, as shown below..
Figure 13.13: Positive and negative 
numbers are used to indicate the 
direction of force vectors.

when drawing a vector.

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Figure 13.15: Four forces act on a 
plane as it flies.
net force - the sum of two or 
more forces on an object.
balanced forces - result in a 
zero net force on an object.
Adding force vectors, the net force
An example
To figure out if or how an object will move, you must look at all of the 
forces acting on it. The sum of all the forces on an object is called the 
net force.The word net means total but also means the direction of 
the forces has been taken into account. Consider an airplane in flight 
(Figure 13.15). Four forces act on the plane: weight, drag (air 
friction), the thrust of the engines, and the lift force caused by the 
flow of air over the wings. For a plane to fly at a constant speed in a 
level path, the forces must all balance. When the forces are 
balanced, the net force is zero.
When net force
isn’t zero
A pilot must always be aware of these four forces and know how to 
change the net force on the plane to speed up, slow down, lift off, and 
land. For example, to speed up there must be a net force in the 
forward direction. The thrust must be greater than the drag. To 
climb, there must be an upward net force. This happens when the lift 
force is greater than the plane’s weight. 
Adding x-y
components
To calculate the net force on an object, you must add the forces in 
each direction separately. Remember to define positive and negative 
directions for both the x-direction and y-direction. In the diagram 
above, +x is to the right and +y is up. The net force in the x-direction 
is zero because the +20,000 N and -20,000 N sum to zero. The net 
force in the y-direction is +5,000 N (+55,000 N - 50,000 N). The plane 
climbs because there is a positive (upward) net force.

277
13.2 ADDITION OF FORCES AND EQUILIBRIUM
CHAPTER 13: FORCES
Equilibrium and normal forces
Definition of
equilibrium
When the net force on an object is zero, we say the object is in 
equilibrium. An object at rest and in equilibrium will stay at rest. 
This also means that when an object is at rest, you know the net force 
on it must be zero.
Normal force
Imagine a book sitting on a table (Figure 13.16). Gravity pulls the 
book downward with a force equal to the book’s weight. The book is at 
rest, so the net force must be zero. But what force balances the 
weight? The table exerts an upward force on the book called the 
normal force. The word normal here has a different meaning from 
what you might expect. In mathematics, normal means perpendicular. 
The force the table exerts is perpendicular to the table’s surface. The 
normal force is also sometimes called the support force.
When normal
force is created
A normal force is created whenever an object is in contact with a 
surface. The normal force has equal strength to the force pressing the 
object into the surface, which is often the object’s weight. The normal 
force has opposite direction to the force pressing the object into the 
surface. For example, the weight of a book presses down on the table 
surface. The normal force is equal in strength to the book’s weight but 
acts upward on the book, in the opposite direction from the weight.
Strength of the
normal force
What happens to the normal force if you put a brick on top of the book? 
The brick makes the book press harder into the table. The book does 
not move, so the normal force must be the same strength as the total 
weight of the book and brick (Figure 13.17). The normal force 
increases to keep the book in balance. 
How the normal
force is created
How does a table “know” how much normal force to supply? The 
answer is that normal force is very similar to the force exerted by a 
spring. When a book sits on a table, it squeezes the atoms in the table 
together by a tiny amount. The atoms resist this squeezing and try to 
return the table to its natural thickness. The matter in the table acts 
like a bunch of very stiff springs. The amount of compression is so 
small you cannot see it, but it can be measured with instruments.
Figure 13.16: The normal force and the 
weight are equal in strength and opposite in 
direction.
Figure 13.17: The normal force is 
greater if a brick is placed on the book

net force on an object is zero.

pressing on it.

showing all the forces acting on an 
object.
The free-body diagram
Forces on a
free-body
diagram
How do you keep track of many forces with different directions? The 
answer is to draw a free-body diagram. A free-body diagram 
contains only a single object, like a book or a table. All connections or 
supports are taken away and replaced by the forces they exert on the 
object. An accurate free-body diagram includes every force acting on 
an object, including weight, friction and normal forces.
An example
As an example of a free-body diagram, consider a 30-newton book 
resting on a table that weighs 200 newtons. The book is on one corner 
of the table so that its entire weight is supported by one leg. 
Figure 13.18 shows a free-body diagram of the forces acting on the 
table. 
Finding the
forces
Because the table is in equilibrium, the net force on it must be zero. 
The weight of the book acts on the table. The weight of the table acts 
on the floor. At every point where the table touches the floor (each 
leg) a normal force is created. The correct free-body diagram shows 
six forces. The normal force at each of three legs is one-quarter the 
weight of the table (50 newtons). The leg beneath the book also 
supports the weight of the book (80 N = 50 N + 30 N). 
The purpose of a
free-body
diagram
By separating an object from its physical connections, a free-body 
diagram helps you identify all forces and where they act. A normal 
force is usually present at any point an object is in contact with 
another object or surface. Forces due to weight may be assumed to act 
directly on an object, often at its center.
Positive and
negative forces
There are two ways to handle positive and negative directions in a 
free-body diagram. One way is to make all upward forces positive and 
all downward forces negative. The second way is to draw all the 
forces in the direction you believe they act on the object. When you 
solve the problem, if you have chosen correctly, all the values for each 
force are positive. If one comes out negative, it means the force points 
in the opposite direction from what you guessed.

13.2 ADDITION OF FORCES AND EQUILIBRIUM
CHAPTER 13: FORCES
Forces from springs and ropes
Types of forces
Examples of the forces you might draw in a free-body diagram are 
shown in Figure 13.19. You are already familiar with weight, normal 
force, friction, and contact forces. You learned about electrical and 
magnetic forces in Chapter 6. Other forces you might encounter are 
forces from springs or ropes. These forces have special properties.
Tension forces
Tension is a force that acts in 
a rope, string, or other object 
that is pulled. Tension always 
acts along the direction of the 
rope. A rope in tension exerts 
equal forces on whatever is 
connected to either end. For 
example, the two people in 
the diagram above are each 
pulling on the rope with a 
force of 100 newtons. The 
tension in the rope is 100 newtons. Ropes or strings do not carry 
pushing forces. This is obvious if you have ever tried pushing a rope.
The force from
springs
The most common type of spring is 
a coil of metal or plastic that 
creates a force when you stretch it 
or compress it. The force created 
by stretching or compressing a 
spring always acts to return the 
spring to its natural length. When 
you stretch a spring, it pulls back 
on your hand as the spring tries to 
return to its original length. When 
you apply a compression force to 
a spring and make it shorter, it 
pushes on your hand as it tries to 
return to its original length.

forces that can be included in a free-
body diagram.

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Solving equilibrium problems
Finding the net
force
For an object to be in equilibrium, all the forces acting on the object 
must add to zero (Figure 13.20). The net force in each direction must 
be zero. That means the total force in the horizontal (x) direction 
must be zero and total force in the vertical (y) direction also must be 
zero. You cannot mix forces in the horizontal direction with forces in 
the vertical direction.
Balancing forces
If you are trying to find an unknown force on an object in equilibrium, 
the first step is always to draw a free-body diagram. Then use the fact 
that the net force is zero to find the unknown force. To be in 
equilibrium, forces must balance both horizontally and vertically. 
Forces to the right must balance forces to the left, and upward forces 
must balance downward forces.
Equilibrium 
Two chains are used to support a small boat weighing 1500 newtons. One chain has a tension of 600 newtons. What is the force 
exerted by the other chain?   
1. Looking for:
You are asked for an unknown tension in a chain.
2. Given:
You are given the boat’s weight in newtons and the
tension in one chain in newtons.
3. Relationships:
The net force on the boat is zero.
4. Solution:
Draw a free-body diagram. 
The force of the two chains must balance the boat’s weight.
600 N + Fchain2 = 1500 N        Fchain2 = 900 N

Defy Gravity? It Can Be Done
How can something that weighs almost a million pounds 
overcome the force of gravity and stay off the ground for 
hours? It almost sounds impossible. Yet it happens 
thousands of times every day, as large airplanes like the 
Boeing 747 fly all over the world. 
When you see a 747 parked at an airport gate, the plane 
looks as big as a building. How does this enormous object 
manage to fly? Simple physics—really!
Newton’s first law of motion states that an object will remain 
at rest unless external forces affect it. A 747 jet plane parked 
on the ground will not move until external forces make it 
move. For that plane to not only move but fly, four basic 
forces are at work: weight, lift, thrust, and drag.
Weight and lift
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The gravitational pull of 
Earth causes objects to have weight and generate force. All 
forces have magnitude (size) and direction. The magnitude of 
weight varies from object to object, depending on mass. A 
suitcase has less magnitude than an airplane. The direction 
of weight in an airplane is down, toward Earth’s center. 
Lift is a force that goes in the opposite direction of weight. 
The magnitude of lift depends mainly on the size and shape 
of an airplane’s wing. 
When an airplane has the two opposite forces of lift and 
weight affecting it, the cumulative effect will determine the 
motion of the airplane. If lift is 
much weaker than weight, the 
airplane will remain on the 
ground. But when the force of 
lift is stronger than the force of 
an airplane’s weight, it will 
leave the ground and fly. 
Controls allow the pilot to keep 
the airplane at a constant 
altitude once it is airborne. The 
forces of lift and weight are 
balanced, and the motion of the 
airplane does not change along 
its perpendicular axis. 
Thrust and drag
Thrust is the force that moves an airplane forward. This is 
the heavy work. On the ground, airplanes move on wheels, 
which reduce the force of friction from the ground. But to get 
that 747 rolling, then airborne, then to keep it flying - this 
requires a lot of thrust. And it is provided by the jet’s 
engines.
The direction of thrust is forward. It moves horizontally to 
the airplane. The magnitude of thrust depends on the 
number of engines and their power. Imagine the power 
required to get a 747 moving from a standing start to the 
takeoff speed of 180 miles per hour. (It’s quite a moving - and 
thrilling - experience, that’s for sure.)
Chapter 13 Connection

283
UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Drag is a force that goes in the opposite direction of thrust. 
Drag is horizontal to the airplane, just as thrust is. But the 
direction of drag is toward the back of the airplane. The 
magnitude of drag depends mainly on the shape of the 
airplane and its wing, and the plane’s velocity.
When an airplane is airborne, air resistance causes drag. 
The more air resistance, the greater the magnitude of the 
drag. When you ride your bike, you feel the force of the wind 
in your face even on a calm day. This is air resistance, or 
drag. If you ride into a strong wind, or pedal faster, the 
magnitude of the drag increases. The same is true of the 
drag on an airplane flying into a heavy wind. 
Once the airplane is airborne, controls allow the pilot to keep 
the airplane at a constant speed. At this point the forces of 
thrust and drag will remain balanced until the wind speed 
changes or the pilot reduces power.  
Combining forces
A 747 has a lot of mass and requires an enormous amount of 
thrust to get it in motion. But how does all that relate to the 
airplane becoming airborne?
The answer lies in the motion of air on the wing. Airplane 
wings are shaped to deflect airflow over the top. The air 
pattern is different on top of the wing from the pattern on 
the bottom, and so is the air pressure. There is greater air 
pressure underneath the wing than on top of it, and this, 
quite logically, produces lift. 
In order to produce enough airflow over and under the wing 
to maintain lift, a tremendous amount of thrust is needed. 
That thrust must be powerful enough to overcome the force 
of drag. When lift has overcome the weight of the airplane, 
and thrust has overcome drag, the forces on the plane reach 
a new balance. An airplane can cruise for as long as its fuel 
lasts or until thrust is reduced in preparation for landing.

Kilograms to Newtons: Make Your Own Measurements!
The unit for measuring force called the newton is named 
after Sir Isaac Newton. Newton came up with the idea of 
gravity as he tried to find an explanation for the orbits of the 
planets around the Sun and the moon around Earth. He 
realized that planets could only be held in their orbits if a 
force of attraction existed between the planets and the Sun. 
He called this force gravity. The force of gravity is also called 
an object’s weight. In the activity below you will explore the 
concept of a newton.

newtons for measuring above 
objects
What you will do
1. Copy the data table. Convert 
each mass in grams to 
kilograms. There are 1000 
grams in a kilogram, so you 
must divide by 1000.
2. Check to see that your scale is 
calibrated to read zero when 
nothing hangs from it.
3. Hang the 50-gram mass on the 
scale and measure the force of 
gravity (weight) in newtons.

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE

the ability to change motion. Without force, 
the motion of an object cannot be started or 
changed.
force - a push or pull, or any 
action that is able to change 
motion. Force is measured in 
newtons (N).
14.1 Newton’s First and Third Laws
Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), an English physicist and mathematician, was one of the 
most brilliant scientists in history. Before age 30, he had made many important 
discoveries in physics and had even invented a new kind of mathematics called calculus. 
Newton’s three laws of motion are probably the most widely used natural laws in all of 
science. The laws explain the relationships between the forces acting on an object, the 
object’s mass, and its motion. This section discusses Newton’s first and third laws.
Force changes motion
Changing an
object’s motion
Suppose you are playing miniature golf and it is your turn. What 
must you do to make the golf ball move toward the hole? Would you 
yell at the ball to make it move? Of course not! You would hit the ball 
with the golf club to get it rolling. In physics language, “hit the ball” 
means the golf club applies a force to the ball. This force is what 
changes the ball from being at rest to being in motion (Figure 14.1). 
Motion can change only through the action of a force.
 What is force?
A force is a push or pull, or any action that is able to change motion. 
The golf ball will stay at rest until you apply force to set it in motion. 
Once the ball is moving, it will continue to move in a straight line at a 
constant speed, unless another force changes its motion. You need 
force to start things moving and also to make any change to their 
motion once they are moving. Forces can be used to increase or 
decrease the speed of an object, or to change the direction an object is 
moving. Recall that velocity is speed with direction. Any change in 
velocity requires force. 
How are forces
created?
Forces are created in many different ways. For example, your 
muscles create force when you swing the golf club. Earth’s gravity 
creates forces that pull on everything around you. On a windy day, 
the movement of air can create forces. Each of these actions can 
create force and they all can change an object’s motion. 

289
14.1 NEWTON’S FIRST AND THIRD LAWS
CHAPTER 14: FORCE AND MOTION
The law of inertia
Force is required
to change motion
There can be no change in motion without force. Anytime there is a 
change in motion a force must exist, even if you cannot immediately 
recognize the force. For example, when a rolling ball hits a wall and 
bounces, its motion quickly changes. That change in motion is caused 
by the wall creating a force that changes the direction of the ball’s 
motion. 
Stopping a
moving object
Let’s keep playing golf and assume you are on a perfectly level golf 
course with no friction at all. Once the golf ball is moving, how can you 
stop it? If you do nothing the ball will keep rolling at the same speed in 
the same direction forever. When the net force is zero, objects continue 
moving with the exact same motion they already have. This idea is 
known as Newton’s first law of motion. The only way to stop the ball is 
to apply a force in a direction opposite its motion. 
Newton’s first law
Newton’s first law says that objects continue the motion they already 
have unless they are acted on by a net force. If the net force is zero, an 
object at rest will stay at rest. If an object is acted upon by 
unbalanced forces, its motion will change. 
Inertia
Inertia is the property of an object that resists changes in motion. To 
understand inertia, imagine trying to move a bowling ball and a golf 
ball (Figure 14.2). Which needs more force? Of course, the bowling ball 
needs more force to get it moving at the same speed as the golf ball 
(assuming the forces act for the same length of time). The bowling ball 
also needs more force to stop. A bowling ball has more inertia than a 
golf ball. The greater an object’s inertia, the greater the force needed 
to change its motion. Because inertia is an important idea, Newton’s 
first law is sometimes called the law of inertia. 
Mass
Inertia comes from mass. Objects with more mass have more inertia 
and are more resistant to changes in their motion. Mass is measured 
in kilograms (kg). A golf ball has a mass of 0.05 kilograms, and the 
average bowling ball has a mass of 5 kilograms. A bowling ball is 100 
times as massive, so it has 100 times the inertia.
Figure 14.2: A bowling ball has 
more mass than a golf ball. The bowling 
ball is harder to move because it has 
more inertia.
Newton’s first law - an object at 
rest will stay at rest and an object 
in motion will stay in motion with 
the same velocity unless acted on 
by an unbalanced force.
inertia - the property of an object 
that resists changes in its motion.
unbalanced forces - result in a 
net force on an object that can 
cause changes in motion.

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Figure 14.3: Four forces act on a golf 
ball.The net force determines how it 
moves.
The net force
Multiple forces
When you hit a golf ball, the force from the club is not the only force 
that acts on the ball (Figure 14.3). The ball’s weight, the normal force 
from the ground, and friction are also acting. Which force determines 
how the ball moves? 
Net force causes
motion
You are right if you are thinking “all forces together.” The motion of 
an object depends on the net force acting on it. There is almost always 
more than one force present because gravity acts on all objects. 
Adding forces
Recall that force is a vector. Adding up forces can be different from 
simply adding numbers because the directions of the forces matter. 
To find the net force, you must include positive and negative signs to 
account for the directions of the forces. Newton’s first law is often 
written in terms of the net force: an object at rest will stay at rest and 
an object in motion will continue in motion at constant velocity 
UNLESS there is a net force. 
Net force and 
the first law
A car drives along the highway at constant velocity. Find the car’s weight and 
the friction force. 
1. Looking for:
You are asked for the weight and the friction force. 
2. Given:
You are given the normal force and engine force. The 
car is moving at a constant velocity.
3. Relationships:
Newton’s first law states that if the car is moving at a 
constant velocity, the net force must be zero. 
4. Solution:
The weight balances the normal force, so the weight is -12,000 N. The engine force balances the 
friction force, so the friction force is -2,000 N.
Your turn...
a. Identify the forces on the same car if it is stopped at a red light on level ground. Answer: The friction force and engine 
force are zero. The weight and normal force are still each 12,000 N
b. As you sit on a chair, the chair exerts a normal force of 550 N on you. If you weigh 600 N, what is the normal force of

14.1 NEWTON’S FIRST AND THIRD LAWS
CHAPTER 14: FORCE AND MOTION
Figure 14.4: You experience the 
third law (action-reaction) whenever 
you apply force to any object, such as a 
basketball.
Think of three examples of action 
reaction that you experienced 
before class today. Write each one 
down and identify the action and 
reaction forces. Also write down 
what object each force acts on. 
Hint: the action and reaction 
forces never act on the same 
object.
Forces always come in matched pairs
Throwing a ball
Newton’s first law applies to the motion of an individual object. 
However forces must be applied by something! Think about throwing 
a basketball (Figure 14.4). You feel the ball push back against your 
hand as you throw it. You know you apply a force to the ball to make it 
move. Where does the force against your hand come from?
 An imaginary
skateboard
contest
Imagine a skateboard contest between Newton and an elephant. They 
can only push against each other, not against the ground. The fastest 
one wins. The elephant knows it is much stronger and pushes off 
Newton with a huge force thinking he will surely win. But will he?
The winner
The result of the giant push from the elephant is that Newton flies 
away with a great speed and the puzzled elephant moves backwards 
with a much smaller speed. Newton wins — and will always win. No 
matter how hard the elephant pushes, Newton always moves away at 
a greater speed. In fact, Newton doesn’t have to push at all and he still 
wins. Why? 
Forces always
come in pairs
You already know it takes force to make both Newton and the 
elephant move. Newton wins because forces always come in pairs. The 
elephant pushes against Newton and that action force pushes Newton 
away. The elephant’s force against Newton creates a reaction force 
against the elephant. The action and reaction forces are equal in 
strength. Newton has a lot less mass (inertia) so he gains more speed.

292
UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
The third law: action and reaction
The first and
second laws
The first law of motion applies to single objects. The first law says an 
object will remain at rest or in motion at constant velocity unless 
acted upon by a net force.
The third law
The third law of motion deals with pairs of objects. This is because all 
forces come in pairs. Newton’s third law states that every action 
force creates a reaction force that is equal in strength and opposite in 
direction.
Every action force creates a reaction force 
that is equal in strength and opposite in 
direction. 
Force pairs
There can never be a single force, alone, without its action-reaction 
partner. Forces only come in action-reaction pairs. The force exerted 
by the elephant (action) moves Newton since it acts on Newton. The 
reaction force acting back on the elephant is what moves the 
elephant.
The labels
“action” and
“reaction”
The words action and reaction are just labels. It does not matter 
which force is called action and which is reaction. You choose one to 
call the action and then call the other one the reaction (Figure 14.5).
Why action and
reaction forces
do not cancel
each other out
Why don’t action and reaction forces cancel each other out? The 
reason is action and reaction forces act on different objects. For 
example, think again about throwing a ball. When you throw a ball, 
you apply the action force to the ball, creating the ball’s acceleration. 
The reaction is the ball pushing back against your hand. The action 
acts on the ball and the reaction acts on your hand. The forces do not 
cancel because they act on different objects. You can only cancel 
forces acting on the same object (Figure 14.6).
Figure 14.5: It doesn’t matter which 
force you call the action and which the 
reaction.

forces do not cancel.One force acts on the 
ball, and the other force acts on the 
hand.

action force, there is a reaction 
force equal in strength and

Action and reaction forces
A skateboard
example
Think carefully about moving the usual way on a skateboard. Your 
foot presses backward against the ground (Figure 14.7). The force acts 
on the ground. However, you move, so a force must act on you. Why do 
you move? What force acts on you? You move because the action force 
of your foot against the ground creates a reaction force of the ground 
against your foot. You “feel” the ground because you sense the reaction 
force pressing on your foot. The reaction force is what makes you move 
because it acts on you. 
Draw diagrams
When sorting out action and reaction forces it is helpful to draw 
diagrams. Draw each object apart from the other. Represent each force 
as an arrow in the appropriate direction.Here are some guidelines to 
help you sort out action and reaction forces:
• Both are always there whenever any force appears. 
• They always have the exact same strength.
• They always act in opposite directions.
• They always act on different objects.
• Both are real forces and can cause changes in motion.

3. Relationships:

The force of 500 N exerted by the woman on the chair seat is an action. The chair 
seat acting on the woman with an upward force of 500 N is a reaction.

accelerates the ball. The force of the ball on the bat (reaction) slows down the swinging bat (action).
b. Earth and its moon are linked by an action-reaction pair. Answer: Earth attracts the moon (action) and the moon attracts 
Earth (reaction) in an action-reaction pair. Both action and reaction are due to gravity.

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Collisions
The effect of
forces
Newton’s third law tells us that any time two objects hit each other, 
they exert equal and opposite forces on each other. However, the 
effect of the force is not always the same. Imagine two hockey players 
moving at the same speed toward each other, one with twice the mass 
of the other. The force on each during the collision is the same 
strength, but they do not have the same change in motion. 
More mass
results in less
acceleration
The person with more mass has more inertia. More force is needed to 
change his motion. Because of his greater inertia, the more massive 
skater will have a smaller change in motion during the collision. The 
forces on each skater are always exactly equal and opposite. The two 
skaters have different changes in motion because they have different 
amounts of inertia, not because the forces are different.
Auto collisions
The same is true of vehicles in a collision. When a large truck hits a 
small car, the forces are equal (Figure 14.8). However, the small car 
experiences a much greater change in velocity much more rapidly 
than the big truck. 
Safety features
Riding in a vehicle with a large mass does not guarantee passengers 
are safe in a collision. Large SUVs are more likely to roll over during 
accidents, and rollovers frequently cause injuries. Auto 
manufacturers conduct crash tests to help them improve the design of 
cars. Safety features such as seat belts, airbags, and antilock brakes 
help make cars safer (Figure 14.9). 
m = 40 kg
m = 80 kg
Force = 200 N

so accelerates more and becomes more 
damaged than the truck.

UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
14.2 Newton’s Second Law
Newton’s first law says that a force is needed to change an object’s motion. But what 
kind of change happens? The answer is acceleration.The amount of acceleration depends 
on both the force and the mass according to Newton’s second law. The second law is 
probably the most well-used relationship in all of physics.
Acceleration
Definition of
acceleration
What happens if you coast down a long hill on a bicycle? At the top of 
the hill, you move slowly. As you go down the hill, you move faster 
and faster—you accelerate. Acceleration is the rate at which your 
velocity (speed with direction) changes. If your speed increases by 
1 kilometer per hour (km/h) each second, then your acceleration is 
1 km/h per second.
Steeper hills
Your acceleration depends on the steepness of the hill. If the hill is a 
gradual incline, you have a small acceleration, such as 1 km/h per 
second. If the hill is steeper, your acceleration is greater, perhaps 2 
km/h per second. On the gradual hill, your speed increases by 1 km/h 
every second. On the steeper hill, it increases by 2 km/h every second. 
Acceleration and
direction
If an object’s acceleration is zero, the object must be moving at a 
constant speed in a straight line (or stopped). Acceleration occurs 
whenever there is a change in speed, direction, or both (Figure 14.10). 
For example, a car driving around a curve at a constant speed is 
accelerating (in the “physics” sense) because its direction is changing. 
Figure 14.10: A car can change its 
velocity by speeding up, slowing down, 
or turning.

of velocity.

Units of acceleration
Speed units and
time units
Acceleration is the rate of change of an object’s speed. To calculate 
acceleration, you divide the change in speed by the amount of time it 
takes for the change to happen. In the example of the bicycle, 
acceleration was given in kilometers per hour per second. This unit 
can be abbreviated as km/h/s. Notice that two time units are included 
in the unit for acceleration. One unit of time is part of the speed unit, 
and the other is the time over which the speed changed.
Metric units
If the change in speed is in meters per second and the time is in 
seconds, then the unit for acceleration is m/s/s or meters per second per 
second. An acceleration of 10 m/s/s means that the speed increases by 
10 m/s every second. If the acceleration lasts for three seconds, then 
the speed increases by a total of 30 m/s (3 seconds × 10 m/s/s). 
 What do units of
seconds squared
mean?
An acceleration in m/s/s is often written m/s2 (meters per second 
squared). The steps below show you how to simplify the fraction m/s/s 
to get m/s2. Saying seconds squared is just a math-shorthand way of 
talking. It is better to think about acceleration in units of speed 
change per second (that is, meters per second per second).
Acceleration in
m/s2
Nearly all physics problems will use acceleration in m/s2 because these 
units agree with the units of force (newtons). One newton is the force 
needed to accelerate a one-kilogram mass at a rate of 1 m/s2 
(Figure 14.11). If you measure speed in centimeters per second, you 
may have to convert to meters per second before calculating 
acceleration. This is especially true if you do any calculations using 
force in newtons.

Calculating acceleration
The equation for
acceleration
To calculate acceleration, you divide the change in speed by the time 
over which the speed changes. For example, if a bicycle’s speed 
increases from 2 m/s to 6 m/s, its change in speed is 4 m/s. Because 
two speeds are involved, subscripts are used to show the difference. 
The starting speed is v1, and the ending speed is v2. 
Positive and
negative
acceleration
If an object speeds up, it has a positive acceleration. If it slows down, 
it has a negative acceleration. In physics, the word acceleration is 
used to describe to any change in speed, positive or negative. 
However, people sometimes use the word deceleration to describe the 
motion that is slowing down.

Force causes acceleration, and mass resists acceleration. Newton’s 
second law relates the force on an object, the mass of the object, and 
its acceleration.
Force causes acceleration, and mass resists 
acceleration.
Newton’s second
law
The relationships between force, mass, and acceleration are combined 
in Newton’s second law.
Force and
acceleration
The stronger the force on an object, the greater its acceleration. In 
mathematical terms, the acceleration of an object is directly 
proportional to the applied force. This means that increasing force 
increases acceleration. If twice the force is applied, the acceleration is 
twice as great. 
Mass and
acceleration
The greater the mass, the smaller the acceleration for a given force 
(Figure 14.13). That means acceleration is inversely proportional to 
mass. Increasing mass decreases the acceleration caused by a given 
force. For example, an object with twice the mass will have half the 
acceleration if the same force is applied.

Applying the second law
Writing the
second law
You can use Newton’s second law to calculate force, mass, or 
acceleration if two of the three are known. The way you write the 
formula depends on what you want to know. Three ways to write the 
law are summarized in Figure 14.14.
Net force and the
second law
Newton’s second law explains the effect of a force, but what if there is 
more than one force on an object? In this case, the force that matters 
is the net force. You must consider all the forces that are acting and 
add them up to find the net force. Then you can use the net force to 
calculate acceleration. If you work in the other direction, calculating 
force from mass and acceleration, it is the net force that you get from 
the second law.
To use Newton’s second law properly, keep the following important 
ideas in mind.
1. The net force is what causes acceleration.
2. If there is no acceleration, the net force must be zero.
3. If there is acceleration, there must also be a net force.
4. The force unit of newtons is based on kilograms, meters, and seconds

The definition of
free fall
An object is in free fall if it is accelerating due to the force of gravity 
and no other forces are acting on it. A ball dropped off a cliff is in free 
fall until it hits the ground (Figure 14.15). Objects in free fall on Earth 
accelerate downward at 9.8 m/s2, the acceleration due to gravity. 
Because this acceleration is used so frequently in physics, the letter g 
is used to represent its value. When you see the letter g in a physics 
question, you can substitute the value 9.8 m/s2. 
Gravitational
force, mass, and
distance
Gravitational force exists between all objects that have mass. 
Newton’s law of universal gravitation says the strength of the force 
depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. 
The greater the masses and the smaller the distance, the greater the 
force. You do not notice gravity between ordinary objects because it 
takes a huge amount of mass to create enough force to notice. You feel 
the force of gravity between you and Earth because the planet’s mass 
is huge. 
Weight
Your weight is the force of gravity between you and Earth. It depends 
on your mass, Earth’s mass, and your distance from Earth’s center. 
You calculated weight with the formula W=mg. The g in the weight 
formula is the same g that describes the acceleration due to gravity. 
The value of g depends on Earth’s mass and the distance between its 
center and surface. If you travel to a planet or moon with a different 
mass and/or radius, the value of g and your weight would change. 

302
UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
Orbital motion
Gravitational
force and
acceleration
Newton’s second law can be used to explain the motion of planets, 
moons, and satellites in orbit. For example, the moon moves in a 
384,000 km orbit around Earth at nearly constant speed 
(Figure 14.16). While the moon’s speed is constant, its direction is 
not. Therefore the moon is accelerating. The gravitational force 
between the Moon and Earth causes the acceleration.
Why the moon
doesn’t fall to
Earth
The moon orbits or moves around 
Earth just as Earth and the other 
planets orbit the sun. But why 
doesn’t the force of gravity just 
pull the moon into Earth? To 
answer that question, imagine 
kicking a ball off the ground at an 
angle. If you kick it at a slow 
speed, it curves and falls back to 
the ground. The faster you kick the 
ball, the farther it goes before 
hitting the ground. If you kick it 
fast enough, the curve of the ball’s 
path matches the curvature of 
Earth. The ball goes into orbit 
instead of falling back to Earth. 
The moon falls
around Earth
The same idea applies to the motion of the moon. The orbiting moon 
falls around Earth. But as it falls, Earth curves away beneath it. 
What do you think would happen if the gravitational force between 
the moon and Earth were to disappear? The moon’s inertia would 
cause it to move in a straight line at a constant speed. The moon 
would fly off into space! 
Satellites
Many human-made satellites orbit Earth providing weather data, 
communications services and scientific research. These satellites 
orbit much closer than the moon and must be launched at speeds 
high enough to reach orbit and not fall back to Earth.

Skateboarding with Sir Isaac Newton 
Who knew that an apple falling 
from a tree would inspire flying 
acrobats? The popular story 
about Sir Isaac Newton sitting 
under the apple tree and the 
universal law of gravitation 
helps explain much of how 
skateboarding works. 
Skateboarders are defying 
gravity by leaping and skidding 
over and onto obstacles at top 
speeds. It also seems like they 
are defying the laws of physics. 
In reality, skateboarders are 
using the laws of physics to make their amazing moves. The 
sport demonstrates Newton’s three laws. 
The laws of motion 
Sir Isaac Newton, a scientist from the 17th century, came up 
with the three laws of motion that explain why objects move 
or don’t move. 
• Newton’s first law is the law of inertia states that an
object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. An object that is
in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and
in the same direction unless an outside force acts on it.
Once in motion, a skateboarder will continue to move
forward (or stay in motion) unless some outside force
affects them. If the outside force is a concrete wall, you
can guess what happens. The skateboarder’s motion
changes fast. Since concrete so often provides the “outside
force” that acts on their motion, skateboarders wear
protective gear. 
• Newton’s second law of motion relates to the acceleration
of an object. Acceleration depends upon the mass of the
object and the force(s) acting on the object. 
• Newton’s third law is probably the best known of his laws
of motion. It states that every action has an equal and
opposite reaction.
How things have changed
When skateboarding was invented, a skateboard was simply 
a two-by-four on roller skate wheels. The goal was to start at 
the top of a hill and ride the skateboard to the bottom 
without crashing. It wasn’t long before skateboarders 
wanted the sport to be more challenging. 
Today, skateboarders use boards with wheels that reduce 
friction. They make incredible moves. Even the most basic 
skateboarding moves rely on the laws of physics. A good 
example is skateboarders in half-pipes. The half-pipe is a U-
shaped ramp that usually has a flat section in the middle. In 
the half-pipe, controlled acceleration is absolutely essential. 
On flat ground, gaining speed 
is easy. Push with one foot, 
and you accelerate. Half-pipes 
are a little trickier. They 
require “pumping.” Pumping 
makes use of Newton’s second 
law. When skateboarders 
pump, they drop down into a 
crouch as they roll through the 
flat bottom of the U-shaped 
half-pipe. As they enter the 
sloped part of the ramp, called 
the transition, they straighten 
their legs. By standing up in 
this way, skateboarders raise their center of mass. The 
sudden shift in their center of mass gives them more energy. 
More energy means acceleration. The shift in the center of 
mass is in the direction the skateboarder is moving. The 
skateboard accelerates in that direction.
Chapter 14 Connection

305
UNIT 5 MOTION AND FORCE
This is like pumping on a swing. The swing goes higher if 
you lift your legs while passing through the bottom of the 
swing’s arc. At the top of the arc, you drop your legs. The 
more times you repeat this movement, the more energy you 
gain. Gained energy translates into swinging higher. This 
same concept is what helps skateboarders gain speed in the 
half-pipe until they have the enough height and speed to 
perform all kinds of stunts.
Motion in action
How does Newton’s third law affect skateboards? In essence, 
it is what allows them to move. For each of the 
skateboarder’s actions, there is an equal and opposite 
reaction. A skateboarder pushes against the concrete at the 
top of a half-pipe. The concrete pushes back. The 
skateboarder is in motion. Friction between the wheels and 
the concrete is a force that acts on the motion. Gravity is 
another force that acts on the skateboarder’s motion. Have 
you ever watched skateboarders in a half-pipe? If so, you 
know that they overcome the force of friction in some pretty 
dramatic ways.
In one impressive stunt, skateboarders soar above the half-
pipe and perform a move called the “frontside 180.” It’s a 
trick that puts a little more spin on physics. Skateboarders 
appear to hang in the air for a moment after flying out of the 
half-pipe. Then they skate back down the ramp. 
Physics tells us that if something is rotating, it will continue 
to rotate unless a twisting force stops it from rotating. The 
same also holds true if something is not rotating. It will need 
a twisting force to start it rotating. Skateboarders use their 
arms to create this twisting force. Also known as torque, this 
twisting force allows the skateboarder to turn around in mid-
air. By pulling their arms in as they twist them, 
skateboarders create torque. That’s how they seem to defy 
gravity in a successful frontside 180.
The evolution of skateboarding will continue to change with 
each new generation. Skating stunts and styles will change 
dramatically, but the science will remain the same.
Questions:
1. Do skateboarders actually defy the laws of physics? Why or 
why not? 
2. How does "pumping" increase a skater’s acceleration? 
3. What is torque and how does a skateboarder use it?

Making a Spool Car
Newton’s three laws can be used to explain the motion of 
everyday objects: from a car driving down the highway to the 
moon orbiting around Earth. The first law says that objects 
at rest tend to stay at rest and objects in motion tend to stay 
in motion with constant speed and direction. The second law 
explains the relationship between force and acceleration 
(a = F/m). According to the third law, an action created by 
one object results in an equal but opposite reaction on 
another object. In this activity you will build a car and apply 
Newton’s laws to explain how it works and why it moves as it 
does.
Materials:
Thread spool, assorted rubber bands, approximately 2-3 cm 
long, metal washer - approximately 2 cm in diameter,
piece of masking tape, pencil, paper clip, 
carpeted floor, rug, or fabric on which to run the car
What you will do 
1. Attach a rubber band to 
the paper clip.
2. Slide the paper clip 
partially through the 
center of the spool, leaving 
the rubber band exposed 
at one end. 
3. Place the washer over the 
rubber band and slide a 
pencil through the loop.
4. Push the paper clip 
through to the other end 
of the spool.
5. Adjust the paper clip so it lies flat against the spool and 
holds the rubber band in place. Use a piece of tape to 
secure it.
6. Turn the pencil several 
times to twist the 
rubber band. Place the 
car on the carpeted 
floor and release it. 
7. Experiment with the 
car until you can get it 
to move in a straight 
line. Adjusting the 
position of the pencil 
may be helpful.
8. Determine the number 
of turns of the pencil 
that gives the greatest 
distance of travel. 
9. If time allows, 
experiment with other rubber bands until you have made 
a spool car that goes as far and as straight as possible. 
Race your car against your classmates to determine who 
has the best car.
10.Try to run your car on a smooth floor and observe what 
happens.

The Solar System
Earth is a planet that is just right for living things — and among 
them are people who have long wondered if other planets have 
life. Mars and Europa (a moon of Jupiter) are good candidates 
for having extraterrestrial life, but are only just candidates. 
Space probes have explored only a tiny fraction of the surfaces of 
Mars and Venus looking for signs of life, and the small amount 
of evidence collected gives no definite answers. If you were asked 
to describe a creature that could live on each of the planets (or 
moons) in the solar system, what characteristics would it have? 
What would it eat? How would it move? A creature on Venus 
might have to live at a surface temperature of 500°C. Neptune’s 
environment is frozen; what type of creature could live there? In 
this chapter, you will learn about the vast, unexplored 
territories that are the planets and moons of the solar system.
Footnote: On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical 
Union (IAU) passed a new definition of a planet. The new 
definition excludes Pluto as a planet. According to the new 
definition, Pluto is classified as a “dwarf planet.”

planet - a massive object orbiting a 
star, like the Sun. A true planet has 
cleared the neighborhood around its 
orbit and has enough mass so that its 
gravity forms it into a spherical shape.
15.1 The Solar System
Ancient observers noticed that five bright objects seemed to wander among the stars at 
night. They called these objects planets, from the Greek word meaning “wandering star,” 
and named them Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In A.D. 140, the Greek 
astronomer Ptolemy “explained” that planets and the moon orbited Earth. For the next 
1,400 years, people believed those ideas, until science proved Ptolemy wrong.
How the solar system was discovered
Planets shine
by reflecting
sunlight
Today we know that planets are not stars. Stars give off their own 
light. We see the planets because they reflect light from the sun. For 
example, Venus appears as a crescent like the moon, becoming dark 
at times. This is because Venus does not give off its own light. When 
Earth is on the same side of the sun as Venus, we see Venus’s 
shadowed side (Figure 15.1 top). The phases of Venus were 
discovered by Galileo in the 1600s and were part of the evidence that 
eventually overturned Ptolemy’s model of the solar system.
Changing ideas
about the solar
system
Almost 100 years before Galileo, Polish astronomer Nicolaus 
Copernicus had proposed that the planets orbited the sun, but few 
believed him. Then came Galileo, using a telescope he built himself to 
make two discoveries that strongly supported Copernicus’s ideas. 
First, he argued that the phases of Venus could not be explained if 
Earth were at the center of the planets (Figure 15.1). Second, he saw 
that there were four moons orbiting Jupiter. This showed that not 
everything in the sky revolved around Earth.
Discovery of the
outer planets
The distant planets Uranus and Neptune are far from the sun and 
don’t reflect much light back to Earth. These planets were not 
discovered until telescopes became large enough to see very faint 
objects. The dwarf planet Pluto is so far away that even today we 
have only a blurry image of it. Astronomers believe that many objects 
like Pluto may orbit the sun beyond Neptune’s orbit in the Kuiper 
Belt. These objects reflect so little sunlight that the two largest 
(Pluto-sized) ones have only just recently been discovered.

15.1 THE SOLAR SYSTEM
CHAPTER 15: THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Organization of the solar system
The sun, planets,
and other
objects
Today, we define the solar system as the sun and all objects that are 
gravitationally bound to the sun. The gravitational force of the sun 
keeps the solar system together just as gravity keeps the moon in orbit 
around Earth. 
The solar system includes eight major planets and their moons (also 
called planetary satellites), and a large number of smaller objects 
(dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and meteors).
Inner and outer
planets
The solar system is roughly divided into the inner planets (Mercury, 
Venus, Earth, Mars) and the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, 
Neptune) The dwarf planet Pluto is the oldest known member of a 
smaller group of frozen worlds orbiting beyond Neptune. The diagram 
above shows the orbits of the planets to scale (the planets, however, 
are really MUCH smaller than shown). Notice that Neptune is farther 
from the sun than Pluto over part of its orbit.
solar system - the sun, planets, 
and their moons, and other objects 
that are gravitationally bound to 
the sun. 
planetary satellite - small body 
of matter that orbits a planet.
The orbits of the planets are not 
true circles, but ellipses. While the 
actual paths are close to circles, 
the sun is not at the center, but is 
off to one side. For example, 
Mercury’s orbit is shifted               
21 percent to one side of the Sun.

Comparing size and distance in the solar system
Relative sizes
The sun is by far the largest object in the solar system. The next 
largest objects are the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
As you can see from the scale diagram below, the planets Mercury, 
Venus, Earth, Mars, and the dwarf planet Pluto appear as small dots 
compared with the size of the sun.
Distance
Astronomers often use the distance of Earth from the sun as a 
measurement of distance in the solar system. One astronomical unit 
(AU) is equal to 150 million kilometers, or the distance from Earth to 
the sun. Mercury is 58 million kilometers from the sun. To convert 
this distance to astronomical units, divide it by 150 million 
kilometers (or 58 by 150). Mercury is 0.39 AU from the sun. Figure 
15.3 lists the planets and the distance of each of them from the sun in 
astronomical units.

15.1 THE SOLAR SYSTEM
CHAPTER 15: THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Gravitational force
All objects
attract
The force of gravity that you are most familiar with is the one 
between you and Earth. We call this force your weight. But 
gravitational force is also acting between the sun, Earth, and the 
planets. All objects that have mass attract each other through 
gravitational forces. For example, a gravitational force exists 
between you and this book, but you cannot feel it because both masses 
are small (Figure 15.4). You don’t notice the attractive force between 
ordinary objects because gravity is a relatively weak force.
Gravitational
force is relatively
weak
It takes an extra-large mass to create gravitational forces that are 
strong enough to feel. You notice the gravity between you and Earth 
because Earth’s mass is huge. We usually only notice gravitational 
forces when one of the objects has the mass of a star or planet.
Gravitational
force and mass
Newton’s law of universal gravitation explains how the strength of 
the force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between 
them. The force is directly proportional to each object’s mass. This 
means the force goes up by the same factor as the mass. Doubling the 
mass of either of the objects doubles the force. Doubling both masses  
quadruples the force.
Gravitational
force and
distance
The distance between objects also affects gravitational force. The 
closer objects are to each other, the stronger the force between them. 
The farther apart, the weaker the force. The decrease in gravitational 
force is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the 
center of one object to the center of the other. Doubling the distance 
divides the force by four (22). If you are twice as far from an object, you 
feel one-fourth the gravitational force.
Gravity on Earth
and the moon
The strength of gravity on the surface of Earth is 9.8 N/kg. Earth and 
a one-kilogram object attract each other with 9.8 newtons of force. In 
comparison, the strength of gravity on the moon is only 1.6 N/kg. Your 
weight on the moon would be one-sixth what it is now. The moon’s 
mass is much less than Earth’s, so it creates less gravitational force.
Figure 15.4: The gravitational force 
between you and Earth is stronger than 
the force between you and your book 
because of Earth’s large mass.
Newton’s law of universal 
gravitation - the force of gravity 
between objects depends on their 
masses and the distance between 
them.

UNIT 6 ASTRONOMY
Figure 15.5: An object launched at 
8,000 meters per second will orbit 
Earth.
Figure 15.6: Orbits are 
mathematically ellipses but are close to 
(shifted) circles.
Orbital motion
Why the moon
does not fall to
Earth
Earth and the other planets orbit the sun. Why doesn’t the force of 
gravity pull the Earth into the sun (or the moon into Earth)? To 
answer the question, imagine kicking a ball off the ground at an 
angle (Figure 15.5). If you kick it at a slow speed, it curves and falls 
back to the ground. The faster you kick the ball, the farther it goes 
before hitting the ground. If you kick it fast enough, the curve of the 
ball’s path matches the curvature of Earth. The ball goes into orbit 
instead of falling back to Earth.
Inertia and
gravitational
force
Orbital motion is caused by the interaction between inertia and 
gravitational force. According to Newton’s first law, inertia causes 
objects to tend to keep moving in a straight line. Force is needed to 
change an object’s speed or direction. Earth has a tendency to move in 
a straight line, but the gravitational force from the sun causes its 
direction of motion to curve toward the sun, into an orbit.
The size of an
orbit depends on
speed and mass
The radius of an orbit is a balance between gravity and inertia. 
Gravity gets stronger as a planet’s orbit gets closer to the sun, forcing 
a tighter curve into the planet’s motion. Increasing a planet’s speed 
or mass has the opposite effect. Higher speed or mass increase the 
tendency of a planet to move in a straight line, resulting in larger, 
less curved orbits. Each planet orbits at the precise radius where its 
mass and speed are in balance with the gravity of the sun.
The shape of
an orbit
The sun’s gravity always pulls the planets toward it. This force would 
create a perfectly circular orbit IF a planet’s velocity vector were 
exactly at right angles to its radius from the sun. As the solar system 
formed from swirling gases, interactions between planets caused 
slight variations in velocity vectors. As a result, the orbits of the 
planets are ellipses instead of perfect circles. Dwarf planet Pluto has 
the most elliptical orbit. However, the deviation from circular is quite 
small. Even Pluto’s orbit is “squashed” only about 4 percent out of 
round. Much more significant, the sun is at a point called the focus 
that is offset from the center. This causes the distance from the sun to 
change as a planet orbits.

An overview of the planets
Classifying the
planets
The planets are commonly classified in two groups. The terrestrial 
planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terrestrial 
(rocky) planets are mostly made of rock and metal. They have 
relatively high densities, slow rotations, solid surfaces, and few 
moons. The gas planets include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and 
Neptune. They are made mostly of hydrogen and helium. These 
planets have relatively low densities, rapid rotations, thick 
atmospheres, and many moons. Pluto is neither terrestrial nor gas, 
but in a class of its own. Table 15.1 compares the planets.

Asteroids and comets
Asteroids
Between Mars and Jupiter, at a distance of 
320 million to 495 million kilometers, there 
is a huge gap that cuts the solar system in 
two. This gap is called the asteroid belt 
because it is filled with thousands of small, 
rocky bodies called asteroids. An asteroid 
is an object that orbits the sun but is too 
small to be considered a planet. So far, 
more than 10,000 asteroids have been 
discovered and more are found each year.
The size
of asteroids
Most asteroids are small — less than a kilometer in diameter — but 
many have been found that are over 250 kilometers in diameter. The 
largest asteroid, named Ceres, is 933 kilometers (580 miles) across. 
While the majority of asteroids are found in the asteroid belt, many 
have highly elliptical orbits that allow them to come close to Mercury, 
Venus, and even Earth. About 65 million years ago, a large asteroid 
hit Earth near Mexico, leaving a huge crater. Some scientists believe 
this event led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Comets
We believe comets are made mostly of ice and dust. The ones we can 
detect are about the size of an Earth mountain. Comets revolve 
around the sun in highly elliptical orbits. In 1997, the comet Hale-
Bopp could be clearly seen in the night sky without a telescope. 
However, we still know little about the composition and structure of 
comets. Several recent spacecraft have made close approaches and 
each new piece of evidence they gather has lead to new insights about 
what comets are made of and how they formed.
Evolution
of a comet
As a comet approaches the sun, some of its ice turns into gas and dust 
and forms an outer layer called a coma. The inner core of the comet is 
the nucleus. As a comet gets closer to the sun, it forms a tail. A 
comet’s tail can stretch for millions of kilometers into space and faces 
away from the sun as the comet continues its orbit (Figure 15.7). 
Each time a comet passes the sun, it loses some mass.

15.1 THE SOLAR SYSTEM
CHAPTER 15: THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Meteors and meteorites
Meteors
Occasionally, chunks of rock or dust break off from a comet or asteroid 
and form a meteor. Imagine a tennis ball traveling at about 30,000 
miles per hour. That’s about the size and speed of most meteors. These 
chunks of dust or rock travel through space and some of them end up 
hitting Earth’s atmosphere. When this happens, meteors rub against 
air particles and create friction, heating them to more than 2,000°C. 
The intense heat vaporizes most meteors, creating a streak of light 
known as a “shooting star.” Occasionally, larger meteors cause a 
brighter flash called a fireball. These sometimes cause an explosion 
that can be heard up to 30 miles away. If you live or find yourself  
away from any city lights, look at the sky on a clear night and chances 
are that, if you look long enough, you will see a meteor. On average, a 
meteor can be seen in the night sky about every 10 minutes.
Meteor showers
When a comet nears the sun, a trail of dust and other debris burns off 
and remains in orbit around the sun. As Earth orbits the sun, it passes 
through this debris, creating a meteor shower as the small bits of dust 
burn up in the atmosphere. During a meteor shower, you can see tens 
and even hundreds of meteors per hour. Because Earth passes the 
same dust clouds from comets each year, meteor showers can be 
predicted with accuracy.
Meteorites
If a meteor is large enough to survive the  
passage through Earth’s atmosphere and 
strike the ground, it becomes a meteorite. 
Meteorites are thought to be fragments from 
collisions involving asteroids. Most 
meteorites weigh only a few pounds or less 
and cause little damage when they hit. Most 
fall into the oceans that cover almost three-quarters of our planet’s 
surface. Meteor Crater in Winslow, Ariz., is believed to have been 
caused by a giant, 50-meter diameter meteorite about 50,000 years 
ago. The Holsinger meteorite (Figure 15.8) is the largest known piece 
of this 300,000-ton meteorite, most of which vaporized on impact.
Figure 15.8: The Holsinger 
meteorite is a large piece of a much 
larger meteorite that blasted out Meteor 
Crater in Arizona about 50,000 years 
ago. This meteorite, while no taller than 
your thigh, weighs 1,400 lbs.

15.2 THE PLANETS
CHAPTER 15: THE SOLAR SYSTEM
15.2 The Planets
The eight major planets of our solar system together contain 250 times the surface area of 
Earth. This vast territory includes environments baked by heat and radiation (Mercury) 
and far colder than ice (Neptune). Venus, the most Earth-like planet in size, has a surface 
atmosphere of hot dense sulfuric acid that would be instantly fatal to any form of life on 
Earth. Our own crystal blue world is unique in having the right balance of temperature 
and environment to sustain life — or is it? Might there be unusual kinds of life unknown 
to us on the other planets? Scientists have recently discovered living organisms that feed 
off hot sulfur emissions from volcanoes on the ocean floor. These organisms might be able 
to survive on Venus. With a combined surface area 1,700 times the size of North America, 
the planets are an unexplored frontier full of discoveries waiting to be made.
Mercury
Mercury
Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, is the 
smallest in both size and mass. Mercury 
appears to move quickly across the night sky 
because its period of revolution is the shortest 
of all of the planets. Only 40 percent larger 
than Earth’s moon, Mercury is a rocky, 
cratered world, more like the moon than like 
Earth. Like the moon, Mercury has almost no 
atmosphere (except for traces of sodium). 
Mercury has no moons.
Surface
environment
Of all the planets, Mercury has the most extreme variations in 
temperature. The side of Mercury that faces the sun is very hot, about 
400°C, while the other side is very cold, about -170°C. This is partly 
because Mercury’s rotation is locked in a 3:2 ratio with its orbit. The 
planet completes three “Mercury days” every two “Mercury years.” 
This also translates into one day on Mercury being about 59 Earth 
days long, and a year on Mercury being not much longer, about 88 
Earth days.

  Venus
Venus is similar
to Earth as a
planet
Venus appears as the brightest planet in the evening sky and is the 
third brightest observable object (after the sun and moon). Venus was 
named after the Roman goddess of love because of its beautiful, shiny 
appearance. Of the planets, Venus is closest to Earth in terms of size, 
surface gravity, and rocky composition. Venus is slightly smaller 
than Earth and, like Earth, has volcanic activity indicating an active 
geology. But there the similarity ends. The dense, acidic, furnace-like 
surface conditions on Venus are not at all Earth-like.
Venus’s surface
is unpleasant
Venus has a thick 
atmosphere which is 
mostly (96 percent) 
carbon dioxide at a 
surface pressure 90 times 
that of Earth. Carbon 
dioxide traps heat; the 
greenhouse effect makes 
Venus the hottest planet 
in the solar system. The surface temperature is more than 500°C, hot 
enough to melt lead and zinc. Venusian clouds are not water, but 
corrosive sulfuric acid (H2SO4) formed from the sulfur emitted by 
many active volcanoes. The first successful landing on Venus was the 
Soviet probe Venera 7 in 1970. This tough lander broadcast the first 
images of the rocky surface in the brief 23 minutes it lasted before the 
corrosive atmosphere destroyed it. More recently, Venus was studied 
by the US Magellan (1989-94) and Messenger (2004) missions, and by 
the European Venus Express orbiter (2005).
Venus day and
year
Venus is one of three planets that rotate “backward,” that is, east to 
west. Its rotation is the slowest of all of the planets; Venus makes a 
little less than one rotation for each revolution around the sun. This 
means that a day on Venus is 243 Earth days, while a year is shorter 
that that, just 225 Earth days. Like Mercury, Venus has no moons.

323
15.2 THE PLANETS
CHAPTER 15: THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Earth and moon
Earth
Earth is a small, rocky planet with an atmosphere that is made of 
mostly nitrogen (78 percent N2) and oxygen (21 percent O2). Earth is 
one of only two bodies in the solar system known to have liquid water 
(the other is Europa, a moon of Jupiter). Earth has an active geology, 
including volcanoes and crustal movement. Earth’s atmosphere, along 
with its vast oceans and moderate temperature range, supports an 
incredible variety of life. As far as we know, Earth is the only planet in 
the solar system to support life. Although space probes have begun 
searching, the ultimate answer to the question of life on other planets 
may have to wait until humans can look in person.
The moon
Earth’s single rocky moon is about one-quarter the diameter of Earth. 
At a distance of 385,000 kilometers, the moon is about 30 Earth-
diameters away from the planet, completing one orbit every 29 days.
The seasons
Earth’s orbit is within 2 percent of a perfect circle. The seasons are 
caused by the 23-degree tilt of Earth’s axis of rotation relative to its 
orbit. When Earth is on one side of the sun, the northern hemisphere 
receives a greater intensity of sunlight because the sun passes nearly 
straight overhead once per day, making it summer. Six months later, 
on the opposite side of Earth’s orbit, the northern hemisphere tilts 
away from the sun. This spreads the sunlight over a larger surface 
area. The lower intensity of sunlight each day makes for winter.
Figure 15.11: Earth is the only 
planet not named after a Roman god. Its 
name comes from Old English “oerthe,” 
meaning land or country (NASA photo).

Mars
Mars
The fourth planet out from the sun, Mars appears as a reddish point 
of light in the night sky. Mars is a relatively small rocky planet with 
a mass only 11 percent the mass of Earth. Mars has two tiny, 
irregular-shaped moons named Deimos and Phobos. Both are much 
smaller than Earth’s moon and are more like asteroids.
The surface of
Mars
The surface of Mars has 
deserts, huge valleys, craters, 
and volcanic mountains even 
larger than those on Earth. 
However, Mars’s “air” is mostly 
carbon dioxide and less than     
1 percent the density of Earth’s 
atmosphere. Like Earth, Mars 
has polar ice caps, but they are 
made of a combination of water 
and frozen carbon dioxide. 
Because of the thin atmosphere 
and the planet’s distance from 
the sun, temperatures are below 0°C most of the time. Because it is 
tilted like Earth, Mars also has seasons. A day on Mars (24.6 hours) 
is similar in length to an Earth day. But Mars’s larger orbit makes a 
Martian year (687 days) almost twice as long as an Earth year.
Mars was
different in the
past
Mars is cold and dry today, but there is strong 
evidence that Mars was much wetter and had a 
thicker atmosphere in the past. Aerial photos of the 
Martian surface show erosion and patterns of 
riverbeds similar to those formed by flowing water 
on Earth. Even today, there is evidence of water 
beneath the Martian surface. Several robot space probes have landed 
on Mars searching for life but the results have been inconclusive. As 
Earth’s nearest match in climate, Mars will probably be the first 
planet in the solar system to be explored by humans.

325
15.2 THE PLANETS
CHAPTER 15: THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Jupiter
Jupiter
The fifth planet out from the sun, Jupiter is by far the largest. 
Jupiter’s mass is greater than the combined mass of all of the other 
planets. Jupiter also spins the fastest, rotating about once every 10 
hours. In composition, Jupiter is much different from the rocky, inner 
planets like Earth. Jupiter’s average density is only 1.3 g/cm3 
compared with Earth’s density of 5.1 g/cm3. Jupiter is a gas planet 
composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, similar to the sun. In fact, if 
Jupiter were larger it would be a star, like the sun.
Jupiter’s
environment
Jupiter does not have a solid surface. In fact, Jupiter is more liquid 
than gaseous or solid — more than half of its volume is an ocean of 
liquid hydrogen. Its atmosphere is about 88 percent hydrogen, 11 
percent helium, and 1 percent methane, ammonia, and other gases. 
The atmospheric pressure below Jupiter’s thick clouds is more than a 
million times that of Earth. A huge storm called the Great Red Spot 
has been observed in Jupiter’s atmosphere for more than 300 years. 
Jupiter’s
fascinating
moons
With 63 known moons, Jupiter is like a mini solar system. In 1995, 
when the US Galileo probe took these photographs, the four largest 
moons became some of the most fascinating objects in the solar 
system. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are like small planets. 
Because it is heated by gravitational forces from Jupiter itself, Io looks 
like a boiling pizza and is covered with smoking sulfur volcanoes. 
Europa has a surface layer of ice as much as 20 kilometers thick. 
Beneath the ice is a vast ocean of liquid water that may even be warm 
enough to support life. Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar 
system, has a magnetic field like Earth. No other moons have this 
feature. Even pock-marked Callisto has many mysteries.

Saturn
Saturn
Saturn, at almost 10 times the size of Earth, is the second largest 
planet. Similar to Jupiter’s, Saturn’s atmosphere is mostly hydrogen 
and helium. Saturn also spins quickly, with a day on Saturn lasting 
about 11 Earth hours. As with Jupiter, Saturn’s rapid rotation is one 
contributor to huge planetary storms in its atmosphere. Because of 
its distance from the sun, a year on Saturn is about 29 Earth years. 
Saturn’s rings
The most striking feature of Saturn is 
its system of rings, which are visible 
from Earth with a telescope. Saturn’s 
rings are made up of billions of particles 
of rock and ice ranging from microscopic 
to the size of a house. Although they are 
hundreds of thousands of kilometers 
wide, the rings are less than 100 meters 
thick (NASA photo). 
Saturn has
many moons
Saturn, again like Jupiter, has many natural satellites. There are 
eight bigger moons and 39 smaller ones known as of this writing. 
Some of the smaller moons act as “shepherds” keeping the particles 
in Saturn’s rings confined through a complex waltz of gravity.
Titan is the
largest moon
Titan is Saturn’s largest moon, and like 
Jupiter’s large moons, is like a small 
planet. It has an atmosphere of nitrogen 
and a surface pressure comparable to 
Earth’s. Astronomers have found 
spectroscopic evidence of organic 
molecules in Titan’s atmosphere, raising 
the possibility of life there. Titan is very 
cold, with an average temperature of         
-183°C. We know little about its surface 
because of its dense cloud cover.

327
15.2 THE PLANETS
CHAPTER 15: THE SOLAR SYSTEM
Uranus and Neptune
Uranus and
Neptune are
similar
Both Uranus and Neptune are huge cold gas planets very much like 
Jupiter and Saturn. Both are about four times the diameter of Earth, 
considerably smaller than Jupiter or Saturn. Like the other gas 
giants, these planets’ atmospheres are mostly hydrogen and helium, 
similar to the sun. Scientists believe all nine planets condensed out of 
the same cloud of interstellar material as the sun. The smaller inner 
planets could not hold onto their lighter gases (hydrogen and helium) 
and their exposed cores became the rocky planets. Under their deep 
atmospheres, the gas giants also have rocky cores.
Uranus
The seventh planet from the sun, Uranus can 
barely be seen without a good telescope and 
was not discovered until 1781. It rotates 
“backward” and has an axis that is tilted 
98 degrees to the plane of its orbit. A day 
on Uranus is only 18 Earth hours, but a 
year takes 84 Earth years. Uranus has at 
least 21 moons, all of them relatively small. 
Titania, the largest, has only 4 percent the 
mass of Earth’s moon.
Neptune
Neptune, the eighth planet from the sun, is the outermost 
of the gas planets. It was discovered in 1846 and its 
discovery almost doubled the diameter of the 
known solar system because of its great 
distance from the sun. Neptune’s orbit is 
nearly a perfect circle; only Venus has a 
more circular orbit. Neptune has a series 
of faint rings invisible from Earth but 
that have been seen in photographs 
taken by space probes such as Voyager. 
Neptune has eight known moons, six of 
which were found in photographs taken by 
Voyager 2 in 1989. Of the eight moons, only 
Triton is bigger than a few hundred kilometers.

Triton, Pluto, and the far outer system
Triton and Pluto
are similar
Triton is Neptune’s largest moon (Figure 15.15). Pluto is a dwarf 
planet, and most of the time the farthest from the sun. Triton and 
Pluto are similar objects in both composition and size. In fact, Pluto is 
slightly smaller than Triton and only a fraction larger than Earth’s 
moon. Some astronomers believe Pluto may actually be an “escaped” 
moon of Neptune.
Triton
Triton was not discovered until 
1846 and not seriously investigated 
until the US probe Voyager 2  in 
1989. Triton is about three-quarters 
the diameter of Earth’s moon, but 
its mass is much lower. Triton’s low 
density of 2.2 g/cm3 points to a mix 
of rock and ice. Alone of the moons 
in the solar system, Triton revolves 
around Neptune opposite from 
Neptune’s direction of rotation. 
(NASA photo)
Pluto
Discovered in 1930, Pluto was named for the Roman god of the 
underworld. The first dwarf planet discovered, Pluto rotates slowly — 
one turn every six days — and backward. Its orbit is strongly 
elliptical and Pluto crosses the path of Neptune for about 20 years out 
of the 249 years it takes to revolve around the sun. Because their 
orbits are not in the same plane, Neptune and Pluto will never 
collide. Because it is so far away, little is known about Pluto.
Are there 8, 9, or
11+ planets?
Outside the orbit of Pluto is a region called the Kuiper Belt. The 
Kuiper Belt stretches to 1,000 AU and is believed to contain many 
asteroid-size and a few Pluto-size objects. As of this writing, two 
Pluto-size bodies have been found, nicknamed Sedna and Xena. To 
avoid confusion, astronomers no longer count Pluto as a planet. 
Instead, Pluto is grouped along with Sedna, Xena, and similar 
distant bodies in the Kuiper Belt Objects (or KBOs).

Jupiter’s Volcanic Moon
We know that volcanoes have shaped the Earth’s surface. A 
volcanic eruption can quickly change the landscape of an 
area right before our eyes. In fact there are several active 
and potentially active volcanoes in the state of California, 
Oregon and Washington. These volcanoes have shaped and 
changed the environment of these areas.
Did you ever wonder if volcanoes exist on other planets? 
There are scientists who study volcanoes throughout our 
solar system. They are 
called planetary 
volcanologists. One such 
scientist is Dr. Rosaly 
Lopes, who studies 
volcanoes on Earth as 
well as other planets at 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, 
California. 
The study of Volcanism
Volcanology is the study of volcanoes that combines geology, 
physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Here on Earth 
scientists study and monitor volcanoes in hopes of being able 
to successfully predict volcanic eruptions. There are several 
key techniques used to monitor volcanoes. On the Earth’s 
surface monitoring can be done locally, observed remotely by 
aircraft or by satellites orbiting Earth. Scientista measure 
ground movement, emission of gases and changes in 
temperature. Scientists from all over the world report their 
findings of volcanic patterns and behavior monthly. The 
Smithsonian Institution in the U.S. publishes them in the 
Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. 
NASA’s Galileo mission to Jupiter
Today scientists can explore volcanic activities far beyond 
the boundaries of Earth. In 1989 the Galileo mission was 
launched aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. The spacecraft 
was equipped with cameras and scientific instruments 
needed to collect data. The mission was named after Galileo 
Galilei an Italian scientist. In 1610, Galileo Galilei 
discovered the four major moons around the planet Jupiter. 
The four moons named Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callsito 
are also called the Galilean Moons in honor of Galileo. 
The Galileo spacecraft was equipment with instruments 
such as the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), 
Solid State Imaging System (SSI) and Photopolarimeter 
Radiometer. These remote-sensing instruments provided 
amazing facts and evidence about the fiery volcanoes on 
Jupiter’s moon, Io.

UNIT 6 ASTRONOMY
Volcanic intensity on Io
In December of 1995 the Galileo spacecraft entered into orbit 
around Jupiter. A series of “flybys” and “close encounters” 
were the primary objective of the mission. The purpose of 
these “flybys” and “close encounters” were to collect pictures 
and scientific information. The spacecraft beamed the 
pictures and data back to Earth for scientist to study. Dr. 
Rosaly Lopes was a member of the Galileo Flight project. As 
an expert on 
planetary volcanism 
she worked from 
1996 to 2001 on the 
NIMS team. She 
helped to plan and 
analyze data on the 
fascinating moon Io. 
She and her team 
were responsible for 
the discovery of 71 
volcanoes on 
Jupiter’s volcanic 
moon, Io.
Today, Io is 
considered to be the 
most volcanically 
active place in the 
solar system. Some 
of the first images of Io were beamed back to Earth from the 
spacecraft Voyager in 1979. The surface is an array of colors 
that include red, yellow, white, black and green. The moon’s 
coloring lead to the nickname “Pizza Moon.”
Flyby observations
Dr. Lopes realized that flying too close to Io could be 
dangerous because of 
Jupiter’s magnetic field and 
intense radiation. The first 
planned “flyby” took place 
in 1995, but no images were 
recorded due to equipment 
failure. Additional “flybys” 
were planned and each 
time volcanic eruptions 
were observed. Dr. Lopes 
realized that the plumes of 
smoke and deposits were 
responsible for the 
changing appearance of Io’s surface. The brilliant red and 
yellow coloring of the surface is evidence of sulfur and sulfur 
dioxide. As the temperature of sulfur changes so do the 
colors of the moon. Red is an indication of an active or 
recently volcano on Io.  
The Galileo spacecraft was so successful that NASA 
extended the mission three times. After 14 years and 
4,631,778,000 kilometers the spacecraft was intentionally 
destroyed on September 21, 2003. It will forever change our 
view of the solar system as scientists continue to explore

Alien Design
The plants and animals that live on Earth are uniquely suited to 
Earth’s environment.  As humans, our bodies are able to withstand 
the Earth’s temperate climate. We survive by breathing the air in 
Earth’s atmosphere, and by drinking the fresh water in Earth’s 
rivers and lakes. Although no life has yet been found on other 
planets, it may be possible for some form of life to live on another 
planet in our solar system, and scientists are continually 
brainstorming what life might be like on a different planet than 
Earth. In this activity, you will create an organism that could live 
on another planet. Follow the guidelines to develop your organism, 
and be creative!
What you will do
1.
Choose any of the planets in our solar system, except Earth.
2.
Develop an organism or animal that can survive on this planet.
Make sure you explain how your organism overcomes the harsh
climate present on its planet. For example, if an animal lived
on Mercury, it would need special protection to survive extreme
hot and cold temperatures.
3.
Explain how your organism exchanges elements with its
atmosphere or soil, and how it moves around the planet. For
instance, how does it “breathe” if there is no atmosphere? How
would an organism move around a planet such as Jupiter,
which does not have a solid surface? How would your organism
deal with the extra gravity on a planet such as Neptune?

The Sun and Stars
Stargazing is an awe-inspiring way to enjoy the night sky, but 
humans can learn only so much about stars from our position on 
Earth. The Hubble Space Telescope is a school-bus-size telescope 
that orbits Earth every 97 minutes at an altitude of 353 miles 
and a speed of about 17,500 miles per hour. The Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST) transmits images and data from space to 
computers on Earth. In fact, HST sends enough data back to 
Earth each week to fill 3,600 feet of books on a shelf. Scientists 
store the data on special disks. In January 2006, HST captured 
images of the Orion Nebula, a huge area where stars are being 
formed. HST’s detailed images revealed over 3,000 stars that 
were never seen before. Information from the Hubble will help 
scientists understand more about how stars form. In this 
chapter, you will learn all about the star of our solar system, the 
sun, and about the characteristics of other stars.

16.1 The Sun and the Stars
What are stars? Where did they come from? How long do they last? During most of the 
day, we see only one star, the sun, which is 150 million kilometers away. On a clear 
night, about 6,000 stars can be seen without a telescope. Ancient astronomers believed 
that the sun and the stars were different from each other. Today we know that the sun is 
just one star like all the others in the night sky. The others appear to be so dim because 
they are incredibly far away. The closest star to Earth is Alpha Centauri: 4.3 light years 
(41 trillion kilometers). That is 7,000 times farther away than Pluto. 
Why stars shine
Nuclear fusion
A star is essentially an enormous, hot ball of gas held together by 
gravity. Gravity squeezes the density of stars so tightly in the core 
that the electrons are stripped away and the bare nuclei of atoms 
almost touch each other. At this high density, nuclear fusion occurs, 
releasing tremendous amounts of energy. The nuclear fusion that 
powers the sun combines four hydrogen atoms to make helium, 
converting two protons to neutrons in the process (Figure 16.1). The 
minimum temperature required for fusion to occur is 7 million°C. The 
sun’s core reaches a temperature of 15 million°C.
The dense core
of a star
The high density and 
temperature needed for fusion 
occurs in the center of a star. 
The density at the sun’s core 
is about 158.0 g/cm3. This is 
about 18 times the density of 
solid copper. In order to reach 
this high density, a star must 
have a mass much larger than 
a planet. For example, the sun 
has a mass about 330,000 
times larger than the mass of 
Earth. 

337
16.1 THE SUN AND THE STARS
CHAPTER 16: THE SUN AND STARS
The anatomy of the sun
The sun has
three regions
Because the sun is made of gas, its surface is hard to define. The 
apparent surface that we can see from a distance is called the 
photosphere, which means “sphere of light.” Just above it is the 
chromosphere. This is a very hot layer of plasma, a high-energy state 
of matter. The corona is the outermost layer of the sun’s atmosphere, 
extending millions of kilometers beyond the sun. Both the corona and 
chromosphere can be seen during a total eclipse of the sun, as shown 
in Figure 16.2.
Sunspots
A safe method for viewing the sun is to use a telescope to project its 
image onto a white surface. (You should NEVER look directly at the 
sun.) When the sun is observed in this way, small, dark areas can be 
seen on its surface. These areas, called sunspots, may look small, but 
they can be as large as Earth. Sunspots are areas of gas that are 
cooler than the gases around them. Because they don’t give off as 
much light as the hotter areas, they appear as dark spots on the 
photosphere (Figure 16.3). 
Figure 16.2: The sun’s corona and 
chromosphere can be seen during a total 
eclipse.

Types of stars
How are stars
classified?
Stars come in a range of sizes and temperatures. Our sun is almost 
an average star in many ways. Some stars are larger and hotter. 
Other stars are smaller and cooler. Astronomers classify stars 
according to size, temperature, color, and brightness.
Sizes of stars
Stars come in a range of masses. The largest stars have a mass of 
about 60 times the mass of the sun. The smallest stars are about one-
twelfth the mass of the sun. This is about the minimum required to 
create enough gravitational pressure to ignite fusion reactions in the 
core. The sun is a medium-sized star (Figure 16.4), as is Alpha 
Centauri, the nearest star to the sun. 
Giant stars
Stars vary in size as well as 
mass. There are two types of 
giant stars. Blue giant stars are 
hot and much more massive than 
the sun. Rigel in the 
constellation of Orion is a blue 
giant star. Red giants are of 
similar mass to the sun and 
much cooler. The red giants are 
huge because they began as 
sunlike stars but have expanded 
out past the equivalent of Earth’s 
orbit. As they expanded they 
cooled down. The photograph 
shows V838 Monocerotis, a red 
giant star. Light from this star is 
illuminating the nebula around it.
Dwarf stars
Stars that are smaller than the sun come in two main categories, 
dwarfs and neutron stars. Dwarf stars are about the size of the 
smaller planets. Sirius B, the largest known dwarf star, is slightly 
smaller than Earth. Neutron stars are even smaller. Their diameter 
is only 20 to 30 kilometers, about the size of a big city.

339
16.1 THE SUN AND THE STARS
CHAPTER 16: THE SUN AND STARS
Distances to the nearest stars
What is
a light year?
Because distances in space are huge, scientists have to use units much 
larger than kilometers or meters. You may have heard of light years 
(ly). Light years are a common way to measure distance outside the 
solar system. One light year is the distance that light travels through 
space in one year. A light year is a unit of distance, not time. 
Calculating
a light year
In space, light travels at the amazing speed of exactly 299,792 
kilometers per second (approximately 300,000 kilometers per second). 
How far will it travel in one year? Recall that speed = distance ÷ time. 
This means we can calculate the distance light travels in one year by 
multiplying the speed of light by time (by rearranging the variables). 
However, to get the correct value, we must also convert seconds into 
years since the value for the speed of light contains seconds. Here’s 
how to solve the problem:
A light year is the distance light travels         
in one year through space 
(9.46 × 1012 kilometers).
Why we need
units as large as
light years
The stars are light years distant from Earth. By comparison, even 
Pluto is only 5.4 light hours away from the sun. The nearest stars are 
4.3 light years away, 7,000 times farther away than Pluto. Our best 
rockets travel at 30 kilometers per second. That speed would take you 
from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 25 seconds. Even at this 
enormous speed it would take 40,000 years to reach the nearest star. If 
humans are ever to venture beyond the solar system, we clearly need 
to develop faster ways to travel.

Stars at 2,000°C give off mostly red and 
some yellow light. At 10,000°C a star 
gives off an even mix from red to blue, so 
the light appears white.
Temperature and color
Temperatures
of stars
If you look closely at the stars on a clear night, you might see a slight 
reddish or bluish tint to some stars. This is because stars’ surface 
temperatures are different. Red stars are cooler than white stars, and 
blue stars are the hottest. The table below lists some stars, their 
colors, and their surface temperatures.
The color of light is related to its energy. Red light has the lowest 
energy of the colors we can see. Blue and violet light have the most 
energy. Yellow, green, and orange are in between. White light is a 
mixture of all colors at equal brightness.
Color and
temperature
When matter is heated, it first glows red at about 600°C. As the 
temperature increases, the color changes to orange, yellow, and 
finally white. The graph in Figure 16.7 shows the colors of light given 
off at different temperatures. The curve for 2,000°C crosses red and 
yellow, but drops off before getting to blue. That means a surface at 
2,000°C gives off mostly red and some yellow. At 10,000°C a star 
gives off an even mix from red to blue so it appears white. At 
20,000°C the emitted light is white with a bluish color.

16.1 THE SUN AND THE STARS
CHAPTER 16: THE SUN AND STARS
Brightness and luminosity
Light radiates in
all directions
You can see a bare light bulb from anywhere in a room because the 
bulb emits light in all directions. When the rays of light are 
represented by arrows, the light coming from a bulb looks like 
Figure 16.8. A star also radiates light equally in all directions.
Light intensity
From experience, you know that as you move away from a source of 
light, the brightness decreases. Brightness, also called intensity, 
describes the amount of light energy per second falling on a surface, 
such as the ground, your eye, or a telescope (Figure 16.9). The 
brightness of a star described as the light reaching Earth.
Light intensity
follows an
inverse square
law
For a distant source of light like a star, the brightness decreases as 
the inverse square of the distance. For example, a star that is twice as 
far away will appear only 1/4 as bright because 1/4 is 1/22. A star that 
is three times as far away will appear 1/9 as bright (1/9 = 1/32). 
Luminosity
The brightness of a star also depends on how much light the star gives 
off. This is called a star’s luminosity. Luminosity is the total amount 
of light given off by a star in all directions. Luminosity is a 
fundamental property of a star whereas brightness depends on both 
luminosity and distance. To understand stars, we wish to know their 
luminosity. All we can measure is their brightness. To find the 
luminosity of a star we need to know both its brightness and its 
distance from Earth. We can then apply the inverse square law to 
calculate the luminosity from the brightness and distance.
Figure 16.8: Light emitted from the 
sun or from a light bulb.
Figure 16.9: Brightness is the 
intensity or amount of light per second 
falling on a surface. In summer, the 
brightness of sunlight reaches

main sequence star - a stable 
star in the main category in the    
H-R diagram.
white dwarf - a small star with a 
high temperature and low 
brightness.
red giant - a large star with low 
temperature and high brightness. 
supergiant - very large, bright 
star that may be blue or red, 
depending on its temperature.
The temperature and luminosity of stars
H-R diagrams
In the early 1900s, the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung and 
American astronomer Henry Russell developed an important tool for 
studying stars. They made a graph that showed the temperature of 
the stars on the x-axis and the luminosity on the y-axis. The result is 
called the Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R diagram. Each dot on the 
diagram below represents a star with a particular luminosity and 
temperature.
Reading H-R
diagrams
H-R diagrams are useful because they help astronomers categorize 
stars into groups. Stars that fall in the band that stretches diagonally 
from cool, dim stars to hot, bright stars are called main sequence 
stars. Main sequence stars, like the sun, are in a very stable part of 
their life cycle. White dwarfs are in the lower left corner of the 
diagram. These stars are hot and dim and cannot be seen without a 
telescope. Red giants appear in the upper right side of the diagram. 
These stars are cool and bright and some can be seen without the aid 
of a telescope. Supergiants, both red and blue, are found in the 
extreme upper portion of the diagram. You can observe red and blue 
supergiants in the constellation Orion (Figure 16.10).

life cycle of a star.
16.2 The Life Cycles of Stars
Like living organisms, stars have life cycles. Of course, stars are not truly “alive” but 
astronomers sometimes use the terms “born,” “live,” and “die” to represent parts of that 
cycle. Our sun, a medium-size star, was “born” about 5 billion years ago. Because most 
medium-size stars have a life ‘1span of around 10 billion years, it will live for another 5 
billion years before it dies. Stars that are larger than the sun have shorter life spans.
Nebulae, birth, and life span of stars
How are stars
born?
A star, regardless of its size, begins its life inside a huge cloud of gas 
(mostly hydrogen) and dust called a nebula (Latin for “mist”). 
Gravitational forces cause denser regions of the nebula to collapse, 
forming a protostar. A protostar is the earliest stage in the life cycle 
of a star. The gases at the center of the protostar continue to collapse, 
causing pressure and temperature to rise. A protostar becomes a star 
when the temperature and pressure at its center become great 
enough to start nuclear fusion. This is the nuclear reaction in which 
hydrogen atoms are converted into helium atoms and energy is 
released. Figure 16.12 shows a portion of the Eagle Nebula, the 
birthplace of many stars.
Main sequence
stars
Once nuclear fusion begins, a star is in the main sequence stage of its 
life cycle (Figure 16.13). This is the longest and most stable part of a 
star’s life. The time a star stays on the main sequence depends on the 
star’s mass. The sun will stay on the main sequence for about 10 
billion years. You might think that high-mass stars live longer than 
low-mass stars because they contain more hydrogen fuel for nuclear 
fusion. However, the opposite is true. High-mass stars burn brighter, 
and hotter, using up their hydrogen faster than low-mass stars. 
Consequently, high-mass stars have much shorter life spans. For 
example, a star with 60 times the mass of the sun only stays on the 
main sequence for a few million years, a lifetime a thousand times 
shorter than the sun’s.

345
16.2 THE LIFE CYCLES OF STARS
CHAPTER 16: THE SUN AND STARS
Planetary systems and binary stars
Other stars have
planetary
systems
A star with orbiting planets is called a planetary system. Until the 
last decade, no one knew whether planets were commonly formed with 
stars or whether solar systems like our own were rare. However, as of 
this writing, more than 150 planets have been discovered around 
nearby stars. Because they give off no light of their own, planets are 
very hard to see against the brightness of a star. Astronomers had to 
devise very clever techniques to find them. Scientists now believe that 
planets are a natural by-product of the formation of stars. Therefore, 
planets of some type should exist around many (if not most) stars in 
the universe.
How our solar
system was
formed
A planetary system (like the solar system) forms out of the same 
nebula that creates the star. The protostar that became the sun also 
contained small amounts of other elements such as carbon, nickel, 
iron, aluminum, and silicon. As the protostar swirled inward on itself,  
it flattened into a disk perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Matter 
that was rotating too fast to fall inward and become the sun 
eventually amassed into planets. This explains why all of the planets 
formed in the same plane around the sun, and why they all orbit in the 
same direction.
Binary stars
Many gas clouds have enough swirling matter that multiple stars 
form, possibly with planets as well. A binary star is a system with two 
stars that are gravitationally tied and orbit each other. Binary stars 
are common. Mizar, the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper, 
was the first binary star discovered, in 1650 by the Italian astronomer 
Giovanni Riccioli. Modern telescopes show that those two stars are 
actually four. Both Mizar A and Mizar B are themselves binary stars, 
making this a four-star system (Figure 16.14). About half of the 60 
nearest stars are in binary (or multiple) star systems. 
Figure 16.14: Mizar, a star in the 
Big Dipper, is actually a double binary 
star system containing two pairs of two 
stars.

Figure 16.15: A planetary nebula 
forms when a star blows off its outer 
layers leaving its bare core exposed as 
white dwarf. This may occur with stars 
that have a mass between 1.5 and 5 
times the mass of the sun.

expanding outer shell of a sunlike 
star. This matter is blown away as 
the core shrinks to become a white 
dwarf.
The old age of sunlike stars
The formation of
a red giant
Eventually, the core of a star runs out of hydrogen. Gravity then 
causes the core to contract, raising the temperature. At higher 
temperatures, other nuclear fusion reactions occur that combine 
helium to make carbon and oxygen. The hotter core radiates more 
energy, pushing the outer layers of the star away. The star expands 
into a red giant as the outer layers cool. In its red giant phase, our 
sun will expand to beyond the orbit of Mars, and the inner planets, 
including Earth, will be incinerated. Fortunately, this event is still      
4 billion years in the far future.
White dwarf
stars
Sunlike stars don’t have enough 
mass (gravity) to squeeze their 
cores any hotter than what is 
needed to fuse helium into 
carbon and oxygen. Once the 
helium is used up, the nuclear 
reactions essentially stop. With 
no more energy flowing 
outward, nothing prevents 
gravity from crushing the 
matter in the core together as 
close as possible. At this stage, 
the core glows brightly and is called a white dwarf. It is about the size 
of Earth, yet has the same mass as the sun. Because of its high 
density, a spoonful of matter from a white dwarf would weigh about 
the same as an elephant on Earth. 
Planetary
nebulae
During the white-dwarf stage, the outer layers of the star expand and 
drift away from the core. In the most extravagant stars this creates a 
planetary nebula (Figure 16.15). The planetary nebula contains 
mostly hydrogen and helium, but also some heavier elements that 
were formed in the core. Over time, the matter in a planetary nebula 
expands out into the rest of the universe and becomes available for 
forming new stars. Planetary nebulae are one of nature’s ways of 
recycling the matter in old stars and distributing new elements.

16.2 THE LIFE CYCLES OF STARS
CHAPTER 16: THE SUN AND STARS
Supernovae and synthesis of the elements
The origin of the
elements
Scientists believe the early universe was mostly hydrogen, with a 
small amount of helium and a trace of lithium. Heavier elements such 
as carbon and oxygen did not exist. So, where did they come from? All 
the heavier elements are created by nuclear fusion inside the cores of 
stars — including the elements in your body. Every carbon atom in 
your body, which is 53 percent of the solid matter of your body, was 
once inside a star.
The creation of
elements
Stars of more than 12 times the mass of the sun have a violent end. As 
the core runs out of helium, gravity compresses and heats the core hot 
enough for other types of nuclear fusion to start. The new fusion 
reactions combine carbon and oxygen into neon, sodium, magnesium, 
sulfur, silicon, and even heavier elements up to iron. Nuclear fusion 
reactions are exothermic, releasing energy only up to iron (Fe, atomic 
number 26). After that, the reactions become endothermic, using 
energy rather than releasing it. When the core of the star contains 
mostly iron, nuclear fusion stops.
Supernovas
If a star’s iron core reaches 1.4 times the mass of the sun, gravity 
becomes strong enough to combine electrons and protons into 
neutrons. The core of the star collapses in moments to form a single 
“nucleus” a tiny fraction of its former size. The rest of the star rushes 
in to fill the empty space left by the core then bounces back off the 
nucleus with incredible force. The result is a spectacular explosion 
called a supernova. A supernova is brighter than 10 billion stars and 
can outshine an entire galaxy for a few seconds. More than 90 percent 
of the mass of the star is blown away (Figure 16.16). During this brief 
period, heavier elements such as gold and uranium are created, as 
atomic nuclei are smashed together.
Neutron stars
The light and heat produced by a supernova fades over time, and the 
remnants become a nebula that can be used to make more stars. All 
that remains of the original star is a core made entirely of neutrons 
called a neutron star. This super-dense object is no more than a few 
kilometers in diameter! 
Figure 16.16: The Crab nebula is 
the remains of a supernova that 
occurred in AD 1054 and was recorded 
by Chinese astronomers.

electromagnetic waves it creates.
Examining light from stars
What is
spectroscopy?
We know what elements are in distant stars from the light the stars 
produce. Astronomers analyze the light given off by stars, and other 
“hot” objects in space in order to figure out what they are made of and 
their temperatures. Spectroscopy is a tool of astronomy in which 
the electromagnetic waves (including visible light) produced by a star 
or other object (called its spectrum) is analyzed.
Chemical
composition
of stars
Astronomers use a tool called a spectrometer to split light into a 
spectrum of colors. A spectrometer displays lines of each color along a 
scale that measures the wavelength of light in nanometers (nm). 
Light waves are extremely small: A nanometer is one-billionth of a 
meter. Each element has its own unique pattern of lines—like a 
fingerprint. For example, when light from hydrogen is examined with 
a spectrometer, four lines are seen: red, blue-green, blue-violet and 
violet (Figure 16.17). Astronomers use spectroscopy to determine 
what elements are present in stars. A star’s speed, temperature, 
rotation rate, and magnetic field can also be determined from its 
spectrum.
The composition
of the sun
In 1861, Sir William Huggins, an English amateur astronomer, used 
spectroscopy to discover that the sun and the stars are made mostly 
of hydrogen. A few years later, Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer observed 
a line at the exact wavelength of 587.6 nanometers. Since no known 
element had a line at this wavelength, he concluded that this must be 
an undiscovered element and named it helium, after the Greek name 
for the sun, Helios. Today, we know that hydrogen is the most 
common element in the universe, with helium second (Figure 16.18). 
Helium is abundant in the sun but rare on Earth.

Big Bear Solar Observatory
Bring your sunglasses - you are about to visit a city with 
more than 300 sunny days a year. Big Bear Lake, Calif.,             
two hours east of Los Angeles and high (starting about 6,700 
feet) in the San Bernardino Mountains and San Bernardino 
National Forest, has something that not all of Southern 
California can boast: four seasons. Because of all these 
features, it has proven an ideal location for a solar 
observatory. Changeable climate provides a great 
opportunity for studying the sun under all sorts of 
conditions. 
A premier site, an improbable location
Big Bear Solar 
Observatory (BBSO) was 
built in 1969 by the 
California Institute of 
Technology. Since 1997, 
it has been operated by 
the New Jersey Institute 
of Technology. The 
National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration 
(NASA), the National 
Science Foundation 
(NSF), the Air Force and the Navy, and other agencies 
finance the observatory. 
The observatory is located on an island in the center of Big 
Bear Lake. It might seem obvious that high altitude and 
clear skies would benefit an observatory - but in the middle 
of a lake? In water, however, scientists have clearer images 
of the sun than on land. 
The science behind this starts, of course, with the sun. When 
the sun heats the ground, convection occurs, the warm air 
rising and the cold air sinking in vertical circulation. Water 
absorbs more heat than does the ground. With less heat 
rising, the convection currents over the water are smaller 
than those on land. A natural light wind blowing across the 
lake also helps to keep images clear - which keeps the 
observatory one of the best in the world. 
The importance of our nearest star
For Earth, the sun is not 
merely important, it is 
essential. It is the planet’s 
source of heat, energy, and 
light, weather and climate. 
The sun’s natural furnace is 
what makes life possible for 
each and every creature on 
Earth. 
The sun is the star closest to Earth. Because of that 
“nearness,” scientists are able to see and study the surface of 
the sun. Other stars are just too far away to view their 
surface features. From the sun, scientists learn about stars 
in general.
Big Bear Solar Observatory staff study the sun, solar 
phenomena, and the solar atmosphere, made up of: 
• Photosphere: the visible surface of the sun.
• Chromosphere: the irregular layer above the photosphere.
• Corona: the outer atmosphere.

UNIT 6 ASTRONOMY
Scientists observe solar flares, explosions from the sun that 
importantly can disrupt communications, satellites, and 
other systems on Earth. They also observe sunspots, which 
are dark, cool areas on the photosphere, and prominences, 
which are arched clouds of gas extending from the sun.
Mighty telescopes
BBSO houses several powerful telescopes. As you know, 
viewing the sun directly is dangerous and safety measures 
are always required. But these solar telescopes have 
cameras and filters specifically crafted for viewing the sun. 
They magnify the sun and provide detailed images of surface 
events. 
At the top of the observatory are four main telescopes. Two 
are used to observe sunspots, flares, and prominences. The 
observatory monitors and predicts solar flares and provides 
reports to interested groups. A third, smaller telescope 
examines the entire sun. On clear days, this telescope works 
from dawn to dusk, taking images every 30 seconds. The 
fourth telescope measures earthshine, which is sunlight that 
reflects onto the darkened portion of the moon and then back 
again to Earth. Earthshine can provide scientists with 
information about our planet’s temperature, atmosphere, 
and global warming.
In November 2005, BBSO replaced its dome with a larger 
one to accommodate a new solar telescope that will be the 
largest in the world. It will help scientists to better study 
solar flares, space weather, and sunspots.
One thing solar observers know for sure is that the sun is 
always changing. It is important for us to understand that 
solar activity so that we can predict its impact on our lives 
and Earth’s future.

1. Why is the sun important to people on Earth?
2. What exactly does Big Bear Solar Observatory observe 
and how does it do it?
3. What is ideal about the observatory’s location?

Sunspots
Sunspots are large, 
dark regions that 
appear on the surface 
of the Sun. They 
appear dark because 
they are cooler than 
the areas around 
them. Sunspots are 
caused by the Sun’s 
magnetic field. They 
slowly grow over a few 
days and then decay 
over a few days. The 
largest sunspots may 
last a few weeks. In 
the early 1600’s, 
astronomers used the 
movement of sunspots 
across the surface of the Sun to figure out that the Sun's 
rotational period was about 27 days. In this activity, you will 
determine the diameter of the Sun and the number of 
sunspots on the Sun.
Materials:
cardboard, piece of aluminum foil (3 cm × 3 cm), tape, a pin 
or sharp point to puncture a hole in the aluminum foil, ruler, 
white paper, solar telescope (sunspotter)
Measure the diameter of the sun
1. First, make a pinhole viewer:  Cut a square (2 cm × 2 cm) 
in the center of the cardboard.  Take the aluminum foil 
and tape it over the opening.  Using the pin, puncture a 
small hole in the center of the aluminum foil.
2. Hold the pinhole viewer so the light of the Sun passes 
through the hole onto a piece of paper held behind the 
viewer.  Hold the viewer and paper as far apart as you 
can.
3. Measure the diameter of the Sun’s image on the paper.
4. Measure the distance between the pinhole viewer and the 
image on the paper. Now, calculate the sun’s diameter!
Distance from Earth to the Sun: 149,600,000 km
Measured diameter of the Sun: _________________ cm
Measured distance from viewer to paper: _________ cm
Measure the size and number of sunspots
5. Using a solar telescope (sunspotter), project the image of 
the Sun onto a flat surface, then trace the sun’s perimeter 
and any sunspots on a white piece of paper.
Applying your knowledge
a. Using the diameter of the Sun that you calculated, figure 
out the size of one of the sunspots viewed through the 
sunspotter.  Tell which sunspot you used and how you 
found your answer.

Chapter 17 
Galaxies and the Universe
How big is everything? How long is forever? In science, 
everything means the universe including all matter and energy. 
In science, forever means the amount of time the universe exists 
or will exist. As a start to answering these deep questions, think 
about the night sky. It’s dark. But why is the night sky dark? 
Imagine the universe was infinite, stretching off to forever in all 
directions. That means in any direction you looked, you would 
eventually see a star. If there were stars in every possible 
direction, the night sky should be light, not dark. This puzzled 
people for a long time and became known as Olber’s Paradox. 
The solution to Olber’s Paradox is that the universe is not 
infinite in all directions, but has a finite size. Nor is the universe  
forever. Time had a beginning between 10 billion and 20 billion 
years ago and time may or may not have an end. It is amazing 
where you find yourself as you try to understand something so 
simple as why the night sky is dark. Of course, we are not sure 
all our answers are correct. Read ahead about galaxies and the 
universe. What do you think?
1. How is the universe organized?
2. Did the universe have a beginning? Does it have
an end?

17.1 Galaxies 
Early civilizations believed that Earth was the center of the universe. In the 16th 
century, we became aware that Earth is a small planet orbiting a medium-size star. It 
was only in the 20th century that we became aware that the sun is one of billions of stars 
in the Milky Way galaxy, and that there are billions of other galaxies in the universe. In 
the past 50 years, astronomers have found evidence that the universe is expanding and 
that it originated 10 billion to 20 billion years ago. In this section you will learn about 
galaxies and theories about how the universe began. 
What is a galaxy?
The discovery
of other galaxies
A galaxy is a huge group of stars, dust, gas, and other objects bound 
together by gravitational forces. The sun, along with an estimated 
200 billion other stars, belongs to the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky 
Way is a typical spiral galaxy (Figure 17.1). From above, it would 
look like a giant pinwheel, with arms radiating out from the center. 
Although some stars are in globular clusters above and below the 
main disk, the majority are arranged in a disk that is more than 
100,000 light years across and only 3,000 light years thick. 
Our sun is
26,000
light years
from the center
The disk of the Milky Way is a flattened, rotating system that 
contains young to middle-aged stars, along with gas and dust 
(Figure 17.2). The sun sits about 26,000 light years from the center of 
the disk and revolves around the center of the galaxy about once 
every 250 million years. When you look up at the night sky, you are  
looking through that disk of the galaxy. On a crystal clear night, you 
can see a faint band of light stretching across the sky. This is the 
combined light of billions of stars in the galaxy, so numerous that 
their light merges. 

357
17.1 GALAXIES
CHAPTER 17: GALAXIES AND THE UNIVERSE
Types of galaxies
The discovery of
other galaxies
At the turn of the 20th century astronomers believed the Milky Way 
galaxy was the entire universe. As telescopes got better, though, some 
“smudges” that were thought to be nebulae in the Milky Way were 
recognized to be whole galaxies far outside our own. The discovery was 
made in the 1920s by Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer. When 
he focused a huge telescope on an object thought to be a nebula in the 
constellation Andromeda, Hubble could see that the “nebula” actually 
consisted of faint, distant stars. He named the object the Andromeda 
galaxy. Just since Hubble’s time (1889-1953), astronomers have 
discovered a large number of galaxies. In fact, many galaxies are 
detected each year using the famous telescope launched into orbit in  
1990: the Hubble Space Telescope, or HST. 
Galaxy shapes
Astronomers classify galaxies according to their shape. Spiral galaxies 
like the Milky Way consist of a central, dense area surrounded by 
spiraling arms.  Barred spiral galaxies have a bar-shaped structure in 
the center. Elliptical galaxies look like the central portion of a spiral 
galaxy without the arms. Lenticular galaxies are lens-shaped with a 
smooth, even distribution of stars and no central, denser area. 
Irregular galaxies exhibit peculiar shapes and do not appear to rotate 
like those galaxies of other shapes. Figure 17.3 shows examples of 
some galaxy shapes.
Galaxies change
shape over time
The shapes of galaxies change over time. It is impossible to actually 
see the changes in a single galaxy, since it takes hundreds of millions 
of years. However, by looking at many galaxies, astronomers can see 
similar galaxies at different times in their histories. This 
observational data has allowed astronomers to develop computer 
based models which calculate how a galaxy changes over hundreds of 
millions of years. It is now believed that the barred spiral form is just 
one phase of a regular spiral. Computer simulations show how the 
“bar” forms and disappears repeatedly as a spiral galaxy rotates.

galaxy shapes.

is an elliptical galaxy in our local group.
Figure 17.5: Two galaxies that are 
near to colliding.
Distances between galaxies
Galaxies are a
million times
farther away
than stars
The distances between stars are 10,000 times greater than the 
distances between planets. The distances between galaxies are a 
million times greater than the distances between stars. For example, 
the distance from Earth to the nearest star is 4.3 light years, but  
from Earth to the Whirlpool galaxy is over 30 million light years. 
The local group
of galaxies
The Milky Way belongs to a group of about 30 galaxies called the 
local group. This group includes the Large Magellanic Cloud (179,000 
light years) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (210,000 ly). These 
Magellanic Clouds are small, irregular galaxies of less than 100,000 
stars. The local group also includes Andromeda, an elliptical galaxy 
2.9 million light years away (Figure 17.4).
Galactic
collisions
Galaxies move through space singly and in groups. Galaxies even 
collide with each other in slow dances of stars that take millions of 
years to complete (Figure 17.5)
Determining the
distance to
nearby galaxies
Figuring out the distance between galaxies is one of the more difficult 
tasks in astronomy. A faint (low brightness) object in the night sky 
could be a dim object that is relatively nearby or a bright object that 
is far, far away. The most reliable method for estimating the distance 
to a galaxy is to find a star whose luminosity is known. If the 
luminosity is known, the inverse square law can be used to find the 
distance from the observed brightness. 
Distant galaxies
This method works for the closest galaxies. However, the vast 
majority of galaxies are too far away to see single stars even with the 
best telescopes. Beyond 150 million light years, astronomers compare 
size and type with closer galaxies to estimate the luminosity of the 
farther ones. This method is not as accurate and, consequently, the

CHAPTER 17: GALAXIES AND THE UNIVERSE
The central black hole
The center of
the galaxy
Since we are located in the outer part of the galaxy, dust between the 
stars blocks out much of the visible light coming from objects in the 
disk. Because of this, astronomers use infrared and radio telescopes to 
study our galaxy. They have learned that the center of the galaxy is 
crowded with older stars and hot dust. Recent studies have suggested 
that a black hole, with a mass of more than a million suns, exists at 
the very center of the galaxy. 
Evidence for
the black hole
theory
The evidence for a huge black hole comes from measurements of the 
orbital speeds of stars and gas at the center of the galaxy. In one 
study, an infrared telescope was used to measure the orbital speeds of 
20 stars over a three-year period. It was determined that these stars 
were orbiting at speeds of up to 1,000 kilometers per second (3 million 
miles per hour). This extremely high orbital speed requires an object 
with a mass that is over 2 million times that of the sun.
Relativity
predicts black
holes
One of the strangest predictions of Einstein’s theory of relativity is the 
existence of black holes. To understand a black hole, consider throwing 
a ball fast enough to leave the Earth completely. If the ball does not go 
fast enough, the Earth’s gravity eventually pulls it back. The 
minimum speed an unpowered projectile must have to escape the 
planet’s gravity is called the escape velocity. The stronger gravity 
becomes, the higher the escape velocity. 
The escape
velocity of a
black hole
If gravity becomes strong enough, the escape velocity can reach the 
speed of light. A black hole is an object with such strong gravity that 
its escape velocity equals or exceeds the speed of light. When the 
escape velocity equals the speed of light, nothing can get out because 
nothing can go faster than light. In fact, even light cannot get out, 
because in general relativity, light is affected by gravity. The name 
black hole comes from the fact that anything that falls in never comes 
out. Since no light can get out, the object is “black” (Figure 17.7). To 
make a black hole, a very large mass must be squeezed into a relatively tiny 
space. For example, to make the Earth into a black hole, you would have to 
squeeze the mass of the entire planet down to the size of your thumb.
Figure 17.6: The core of the Milky 
Way is in the direction of the 
constellation Sagittarius. Astronomers 
believe a huge black hole lives at the core 
of the Milky Way and most other large 
galaxies.
Figure 17.7: Light from a black hole 
cannot escape because the escape 
velocity is higher than the speed of light.

Figure 17.8: The top diagram shows 
the hydrogen spectrum for an object that 
is not moving. The bottom diagram 
shows the hydrogen spectral lines for a 
moving star. While the lines are in the 
exact same pattern, they have shifted 
toward the red end of the spectrum.
Figure 17.9: Hubble discovered that 
the redshift (speed) of galaxies increased 
proportionally to their distance.
The expanding universe
Sirius is moving
away from Earth
In the 1890s, astronomers began to use spectroscopy to study the 
stars and other objects in space. One of the first stars they studied, 
Sirius, had spectral lines in the same pattern as the spectrum for 
hydrogen. However, these lines did not have the exact same 
measurements as those for hydrogen. Instead, they were shifted 
toward the red end of the visible spectrum. This was a puzzle at first, 
until scientists realized that a red-shifted spectrum meant Sirius was 
moving away from Earth. They could even determine how fast Sirius 
was moving away by measuring the amount that the lines had shifted 
toward red (Figure 17.8).
Redshift
Redshift is caused by relative motion that increases the distance from 
the source to the observer. The faster the source of light is moving 
away from the observer, the greater the redshift. The opposite 
(blueshift) happens when an object is moving toward the observer. A 
star moving toward Earth would show a spectrum for hydrogen that 
was shifted toward the blue end of the scale. 
Discovery of the
expanding
universe
In the late 1920s, Hubble began to measure the distance and redshift 
of galaxies. Much to his surprise, he discovered that the farther away 
a galaxy was, the faster it was moving away from Earth. By the early 
1930s, he had enough evidence to prove that galaxies were moving 
away from each other with a speed proportional to the distance 
between them. This concept came to be known as the expanding 
universe.
The Big Bang
theory
The expanding universe was a great surprise to scientists. Before 
Hubble’s discovery, people believed the universe had existed in its 
same form for all time. The fact that the universe was expanding 
implies the universe must have been smaller in the past than it is 
today. In fact, it implies that the universe must have had a 
beginning. Astronomers today believe the universe exploded outward 
from a single point smaller than an atom into the vast expanse of 
galaxies and space we see today. This idea is known as the Big Bang 
theory.

361
17.1 GALAXIES
CHAPTER 17: GALAXIES AND THE UNIVERSE
The Big Bang theory
The Big Bang
theory
The Big Bang theory says the universe began as a huge explosion 
between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago. According to this theory, 
all matter and energy started in a space smaller than the nucleus of 
an atom. Suddenly, (no one knows why) a huge explosion occurred 
that sent everything that makes up the universe spraying out in all 
directions. In its first moments of existence, the universe was an 
extremely hot fireball of pure energy that began to expand rapidly.
Protons and
neutrons form
at 4 minutes
As the universe expanded, it cooled down as its energy spread out over 
a larger volume. About four minutes after the Big Bang, the universe 
had cooled enough that protons and neutrons could stick together to 
form the nuclei of atoms. Because atoms were still flying around with 
high energy, heavy nuclei were smashed apart. Only one helium atom 
survived for every 12 hydrogen atoms. Almost no elements heavier 
than helium survived. When we look at the matter in the universe 
today, we see this ratio of hydrogen to helium left by the Big Bang, 
with the exception of elements formed later in stars.
Matter and light
decouple in
700,000 years
For the next 700,000 years the universe was like the inside of a star: 
hot ionized hydrogen and helium. At the age of 700,000 years, the 
universe had expanded enough to become transparent to light. At this 
point, the light from the fireball was freed from constant interaction 
with hot matter. The light continued to expand separately from 
matter and became the cosmic background radiation we see today.
Stars and
galaxies form
When the universe was about 1 billion years old, it had expanded and 
cooled enough that galaxies and stars could form. At this point the 
universe probably began to look similar to how it looks today. The sun 
and solar system formed about 4 billion years ago, by which time the 
universe was 12 billion years old.
Unresolved
questions
While scientists feel relatively confident about the overall picture, 
they are not confident about the details. For example, recent 
observations suggest the expansion of the universe is accelerating. 
This is a puzzle because, if anything, gravity should be slowing the 
expansion down.

universe began as a huge

UNIT 6 ASTRONOMY

expansion of the universe is strong 
evidence for the Big Bang theory.
Figure 17.12: The COBE satellite 
measured this image of the cosmic 
background radiation. (NASA)
Figure 17.13: The universe is mostly 
hydrogen with a small amount of 
helium and tiny amounts of other 
elements.
Evidence for the Big Bang theory
Evidence
for the Big Bang
When it was first introduced, not everyone believed the Big Bang. In 
fact, the name “Big Bang” was made up by scientists to mock the 
theory. Unfortunately for them, the name stuck. As with any new 
theory, the Big Bang became more accepted as new scientific tools 
and discoveries established more evidence. 
The fact that galaxies are expanding away from each other is a strong 
argument for the Big Bang. As far as we can look into the universe, 
we find galaxies are expanding away from each other. On average, we 
do not see galaxies coming toward each other (Figure 17.11).
Microwave
background
radiation
In the 1960s, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, two American 
astrophysicists, were trying to measure electromagnetic waves given 
off by the Milky Way. No matter how they refined their technique, 
they kept detecting a background noise that interfered with their 
observations. This noise seemed to be coming from all directions and 
had little variation in frequency. 
When you light a match, the flame bursts rapidly from the first spark 
and then cools as it expands. When the Big Bang exploded, it also 
created hot radiation. This radiation has been expanding and cooling 
for 16 billion years. The radiation is now at a temperature only 2.7°C 
above absolute zero and it fills the universe. The cosmic background 
radiation is the “smoke” from the Big Bang that fills the room (that 
is, the universe), even 16 billion years later. The “noise” that Penzias 
and Wilson found was the cosmic microwave background radiation 
predicted by the Big Bang theory (Figure 17.12).
Ratios of the
elements
We have other evidence that supports the Big Bang theory. The 
proportion of hydrogen to helium is consistent with the physics of the 
Big Bang (Figure 17.13). Elements heavier than hydrogen and 
helium are formed in stars. When stars reach the end of their life 
cycles, they spread heavy elements such as carbon, oxygen, and iron 
out into the universe. If the universe were significantly older, there 
would be more heavy elements present compared with hydrogen and 
helium.

A Spectacular Show of Lights
Do you think of weather as an Earth-only phenomenon? 
Then it will broaden your horizons to know there is weather 
in outer space, and, just like on Earth, conditions there 
change constantly. 
Weather on our planet is affected by factors such as 
temperature, wind, precipitation, and by the sun’s heat and 
light.  In space, the sun drives the weather. Explosions on 
the sun’s surface can cause radiation storms, changes in 
magnetic fields, and movement of energetic particles. The 
fast-moving solar wind carries charged particles away from 
the sun. Some of these particles and energy are able to 
penetrate Earth’s upper atmosphere, and when this 
happens, an aurora is created - a spectacular show of lights.
Charged particles and auroras
Our planet is a magnetic object. Magnetic field lines travel 
between the north and south poles. Charged electron 
particles trapped in these field lines create what is known as 
Earth’s magnetic field (also called the magnetosphere).  
This magnetosphere 
protects Earth from 
solar wind that 
contains energetic 
particles and 
radiation. An aurora is 
caused by energy from 
the sun. Charged 
particles from the sun 
travel down Earth’s 
magnetic field lines 
forming oval shapes. These so-called auroral ovals cover each 
magnetic pole. When electrons hit Earth’s upper 
atmosphere, light particles are released. These colliding 
solar particles and atmospheric gases create aurora lights.
Generally, aurorae occur at higher latitudes, closer to the 
magnetic poles. Auroral ovals are usually located at 60° and 
70° latitude, north and south. At 45°, aurorae are seen about 
fives times per year. Above 55°, aurorae are visible almost 
every night if viewing conditions are right. In November 
2004, auroral ovals could be seen as far south as Arizona, 
whose latitude is 31° to 37°. 
Dazzling details
An aurora looks like streaks of colored light in the dark night 
sky. Commonly seen aurora colors include green, yellow, and 
red. The gases present in the atmosphere determine the 
color. The electromagnetic radiation in an aurora also 
includes infrared and ultraviolet, neither of which the 
human eye can see.  
The aurora in the Northern Hemisphere is called aurora 
borealis or the northern lights, and is popularly viewed from 
Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Scandinavia, and Russia. In the 
Southern Hemisphere, the southern lights, or aurora 
australis, tend to occur in remote, barely populated areas.

UNIT 6 ASTRONOMY
This photo of aurora australis was taken at the Antarctica 
South Pole Weather Station in 1979.
Clear, dark nights are best for seeing an aurora. Cloud cover, 
moonlight, and city lights can interfere with viewing. 
Space Environment Center
The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) and the Air Force operate the Space Environment 
Center (SEC) in Boulder, Colo. The center provides real-time 
information about solar events and space weather that may 
affect people and equipment. It issues alerts and warnings to 
any organization that needs space weather information. 
Space weather storms can damage satellites, interrupt cell 
phone systems, and disable electric power grids, which are 
networks of power lines and equipment that provide 
electrical power to large areas. In 1989, Montreal, Quebec, 
lost power for nine hours because of a large geomagnetic 
storm. 
Space weather can also affect short wave radio systems and 
Global Positioning Systems (GPS). GPS is a satellite system 
that tracks the location of vehicles, planes, and boats. GPS 
relies on accurate and timely data that can be hampered 
severely by geomagnetic storms. NASA also requires timely 
information to make decisions about launching satellites and 
manned space vehicles. 
NOAA’s Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) 
contain monitors and detectors that gather data as they 
travel over the poles. POES provides information about 
aurora size, intensity, and location. The SEC website 
supplies regularly updated auroral oval images and data.
The SEC uses magnetometers to measure geomagnetic 
activity. Data is provided to create indices or guides to 
determine the likelihood of an aurora. The K index provides 
data on a scale from 0 to 9. The higher the value the more 
likely an aurora will occur. The Kp index (also on a 0-9 scale) 
is updated every three hours and collects data from 13 
geomagnetic observatories. These values tell how far south 
an aurora can be seen past the magnetic north pole.
Maybe some night your location, viewing conditions, and the 
geomagnetic activity all will be right for you to witness a 
spectacular natural show of lights.

1. What causes an aurora?
2. What is the SEC and what is its role?
3. What conditions are needed for viewing an aurora?

this concept:
1.a. Students know position is defined in relation to some choice of a standard reference point and a set of 
reference directions.

the speed of an object along the path traveled can vary.

1.c. Students know how to solve problems involving distance, time, and average speed.

1.d. Students know the velocity of an object must be described by specifying both the direction and the speed of 
the object.

1.e. Students know changes in velocity may be due to changes in speed, direction, or both.

1.f. Students know how to interpret graphs of position versus time and graphs of speed versus time for motion in a 
single direction.

STANDARD SET 2. Forces
2. Unbalanced

basis for 
understanding 
this concept:
2.a. Students know a force has both direction and magnitude.

2.b. Students know when an object is subject to two or more forces at once, the result is the cumulative effect of 
all the forces.

2.c. Students know when the forces on an object are balanced, the motion of the object does not change.

2.d. Students know how to identify separately the two or more forces that are acting on a single static object, 
including gravity, elastic forces due to tension or compression in matter, and friction.

2.e. Students know that when the forces on an object are unbalanced, the object will change its velocity (that is, 
it will speed up, slow down, or change direction).

2.f. Students know the greater the mass of an object, the more force is needed to achieve the same rate of 
change in motion.

2.g. Students know the role of gravity in forming and maintaining the shapes of planets, stars, and the solar 
system.

STANDARD SET 3. Structure of Matter
Completed
3. Each of the 
more than 100 
elements of 
matter has 
distinct 
properties and 
a distinct 
atomic 
structure. All 
forms of 
matter are 
composed of 
one or more of 
the elements. 
As a basis for 
understanding 
this concept:
3.a. Students know the structure of the atom and know it is composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

3.b. Students know that compounds are formed by combining two or more different elements and that compounds 
have properties that are different from their constituent elements.

3.c. Students know atoms and molecules form solids by building up repeating patterns, such as the crystal 
structure of NaCl or long-chain polymers.

3.d. Students know the states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) depend on molecular motion.

3.e. Students know that in solids the atoms are closely locked in position and can only vibrate; in liquids the atoms 
and molecules are more loosely connected and can collide with and move past one another; and in gases the 
atoms and molecules are free to move independently, colliding frequently.

3.f. Students know how to use the periodic table to identify elements in simple compounds.

STANDARD SET 4. Earth in the Solar System (Earth Sciences)
4. The structure 
and 
composition of 
the universe 
can be learned 
from studying 
stars and 
galaxies and 
their 
evolution. As a 
basis for 
understanding 
this concept:
4.a. Students know galaxies are clusters of billions of stars and may have different shapes.

4.b. Students know that the Sun is one of many stars in the Milky Way galaxy and that stars may differ in size, 
temperature, and color.

4.c. Students know how to use astronomical units and light years as measures of distance between the Sun, stars, 
and Earth.

4.d. Students know that stars are the source of light for all bright objects in outer space and that the Moon and 
planets shine by reflected sunlight, not by their own light.

4.e. Students know the appearance, general composition, relative position and size, and motion of objects in the 
solar system, including planets, planetary satellites, comets, and asteroids.


386
STANDARD SET 5. Reactions
Completed
5. Chemical 
reactions are 
processes in 
which atoms 
are rearranged 
into different 
combinations 
of molecules. 
As a basis for 
understanding 
this concept:
5.a. Students know reactant atoms and molecules interact to form products with different chemical properties.

5.b. Students know the idea of atoms explains the conservation of matter: In chemical reactions the number of 
atoms stays the same no matter how they are arranged, so their total mass stays the same.

5.c. Students know chemical reactions usually liberate heat or absorb heat.

5.d. Students know physical processes include freezing and boiling, in which a material changes form with no 
chemical reaction.

5.e. Students know how to determine whether a solution is acidic, basic, or neutral.

STANDARD SET 6. Chemistry of Living Systems (Life Sciences)
6. Principles of 
chemistry 
underlie the 
functioning of 
biological 
systems. As a 
basis for 
understanding 
this concept:
6.a. Students know that carbon, because of its ability to combine in many ways with itself and other elements, has 
a central role in the chemistry of living organisms.

6.b. Students know that living organisms are made of molecules consisting largely of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, 
oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.

6.c. Students know that living organisms have many different kinds of molecules, including small ones, such as 
water and salt, and very large ones, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and DNA.

STANDARD SET 7. Periodic Table
7. The 
organization of 
the periodic 
table is based 
on the 
properties of 
the elements 
and reflects 
the structure 
of atoms. As a 
basis for 
understanding 
this concept:
7.a. Students know how to identify regions corresponding to metals, non-metals, and inert gases.

7.b. Students know each element has a specific number of protons in the nucleus (the atomic number) and each 
isotope of the element has a different but specific number of neutrons in the nucleus.

7.c. Students know substances can be classified by their properties, including their melting temperature, density, 
hardness, and thermal and electrical conductivity.

STANDARD SET 8. Density and Buoyancy
Completed
8. All objects 
experience a 
buoyant force 
when immersed 
in a fluid. As a 
basis for 
understanding 
this concept:
8.a. Students know density is mass per unit volume.

8.b. Students know how to calculate the density of substances (regular and irregular solids and liquids) from 
measurements of mass and volume.

8.c. Students know the buoyant force on an object in a fluid is an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid the 
object has displaced.

8.d. Students know how to predict whether an object will float or sink.

STANDARD SET 9. Investigation and Experimentation
9. Scientific 
progress is 
made by asking 
meaningful 
questions and 
conducting 
careful 
investigations. 
As a basis for 
understanding 
this concept 
and addressing 
the content in 
the other three 
strands, 
students 
should develop 
their own 
questions and 
perform 
investigations. 
Students will:
9.a. Plan and conduct a scientific investigation to test a hypothesis. 

9.b. Evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of data. 

9.c. Distinguish between variable and controlled parameters in a test. 

9.d. Recognize the slope of the linear graph as the constant in the relationship y = kx and apply this principle in 
interpreting graphs constructed from data. 

9.e. Construct appropriate graphs from data and develop quantitative statements about the relationships between 
variables. 

9.f. Apply simple mathematical relationships to determine a missing quantity in a mathematic expression, given 
the two remaining terms (including speed = distance/time, density = mass/volume, force = pressure × area, 
volume = area × height). 

9.g. Distinguish between linear and nonlinear relationships on a graph of data.
