Perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells offer the possibility of overcoming 
the power conversion efficiency limit of conventional silicon solar cells. 
Various textured tandem devices have been presented aiming at improved 
optical performance, but optimizing film growth on surface-textured 
wafers remains challenging. Here we present perovskite–silicon tandem 
solar cells with periodic nanotextures that offer various advantages without 
compromising the material quality of solution-processed perovskite layers. 
We show a reduction in reflection losses in comparison to planar tandems, 
with the new devices being less sensitive to deviations from optimum layer 
thicknesses. The nanotextures also enable a greatly increased fabrication 
yield from 50% to 95%. Moreover, the open-circuit voltage is improved by 
15 mV due to the enhanced optoelectronic properties of the perovskite 
top cell. Our optically advanced rear reflector with a dielectric buffer layer 
results in reduced parasitic absorption at near-infrared wavelengths. As a 
result, we demonstrate a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.80%.
Monolithic two-terminal perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells (PST-
SCs) have recently achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) 
exceeding 31%1, thus overcoming the physical limit of conventional 
crystalline-silicon single-junction solar cells2. Such high PCEs were 
reached by continuous improvements of the optical and electronic 
properties of PSTSCs. These improvements include, amongst others, 
switching the cell polarity for enhanced top-contact transmission3 and 
fine-tuning of various layers to improve the optical performance4–6. 
In addition, various publications have addressed the improvement 
of the electronic properties by optimizing contact layers7, utilizing 
additives8,9 and adjusting the perovskite composition10 or deposition11. 
Numerical studies underline the importance of adequate light manage-
ment by introducing textured device interfaces for high PCEs12,13. For 
silicon solar cells, potassium-hydroxide-etched random pyramidal 
textures with a size of several micrometres are commonly used for 
light management. However, they are not compatible without fur-
ther adaptation with solution-processed perovskite absorbers, which 
result in the highest reported PCEs of perovskite single-junction solar

silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H(n)), doped indium oxide as the transparent 
conducting oxide (TCO), a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) denoted 
Me-4PACz ([4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid), 
a mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskite absorber, lithium fluoride 
(LiF), C60, tin oxide and indium zinc oxide. The perovskite composition 
is either Cs0.05(FA0.79MA0.21)0.95Pb(I0.79Br0.21)3 or (Cs0.05(FA0.77MA0.23)0.95Pb
(I0.77Br0.23)3 with bandgap energies of 1.66 eV or 1.68 eV, respectively.
The sinusoidal nanostructure at the front surface of the silicon 
subcell (Fig. 1b,c) was manufactured by combining ultraviolet nano-
imprint lithography, reactive ion etching and wet chemical etching26. 
The experimental procedure is detailed in Methods. The resulting 
nanotexture has a hexagonal lattice with a period of 750 nm and a 
peak-to-valley height of approximately 300 nm (Fig. 1d). This nano-
texture can be completely covered by the perovskite film with a typical 
thickness of 500–600 nm (on planar surfaces) revealing a flat perovs-
kite front surface on the C60 side. At the rear side of the silicon wafer we 
applied a reflector with an RDBL27 (Fig. 1c). The RDBL comprises a SiO2 
buffer layer between the TCO and the silver back-reflector, reducing 
parasitic absorption losses. A silver grid covering 4% of the active area 
is screen-printed on top of the TCO before SiO2 deposition to establish 
the electric contact between the TCO and Ag (Fig. 1e, right side).
Perovskite film formation and morphology
Although Me-4PACz improves the electronic properties (for example, 
compared to 2PACz and poly(triaryl amine)), the suboptimal formation 
of perovskite films on planar bottom cells/Me-4PACz often leads to mac-
roscopic holes (Fig. 2a). However, when the perovskite is spin-coated 
onto nanotextured silicon bottom cells covered with Me-4PACz (Fig. 2b),  
the occurrence of macroscopic holes is strongly reduced. After the per-
ovskite was deposited, we visually inspected the samples and rejected 
any that exhibited macroscopic holes. As illustrated in Fig. 2c, out of 45 
processed nanotextured tandem solar cells, only two had visible holes 
after perovskite spin-coating (∼95% yield). In contrast, out of 30 planar 
devices, which were processed in parallel to the nanotextured cells, 15 
showed macroscopic holes (~50% yield). To obtain a more systematic 
understanding of this observation, we measured the static contact 
angle and the roll-off angle of the perovskite solution on the respective 
surfaces (Fig. 2d,e). We find decreased surface energy and reduced 
wettability on the nanostructured surfaces compared to the planar 
surface (see static contact angle measurement as insets). However, 
reduced wettability does not necessarily lead to a reduction in droplet 
cells so far14. In recent years, different approaches to implement light 
management textures in PSTSCs have been investigated, either by 
adapting the perovskite deposition technique but leaving the pyrami-
dal texture unchanged15–18, or by adapting the textures such that per-
ovskite solution-processing becomes feasible9,19–23 (Supplementary  
Fig. 1). These studies demonstrated remarkable optical improvements 
in PSTSCs and provided insights into the morphology and optoelec-
tronic properties of textured perovskite top cells. However, it remains 
a major challenge to develop an appropriate texture, which is able to 
balance the persistent trade-off between electronic and optical per-
formance of textured PSTSCs with solution-processed perovskite top 
cells. In recent studies we already introduced gentle sinusoidal nano-
textures with submicrometre feature size as promising candidate for 
PSTSCs: optical simulations indicated that the PCE can be substantially 
enhanced compared to planar reference tandem solar cells24. We further 
demonstrated experimentally that such nanotextures provide a feasible 
light-management approach in both solution-processed perovskite25 
and silicon26 single-junction solar cells, without compromising the 
optoelectronic quality of the respective absorber.
In this work, we present PSTSCs with a gentle sinusoidal nano-
texture connecting the advantages of structuring the silicon surface 
while preserving the material quality of the solution-processed perovs-
kite. We show that the nanotexturing causes a substantial reduction 
of reflection losses compared to their planar counterpart, strongly 
improves the fabrication yield enabled by the excellent film formation 
properties and increases the open-circuit voltage by 15 mV. To meet the 
challenge of parasitic absorption losses, we further implement a reflec-
tor with a dielectric buffer layer (RDBL) at the rear side of the silicon 
bottom cell. Combining both approaches, the gentle nanotexture at 
the front side and the reflector with dielectric buffer layer at the rear 
side of the silicon bottom cell, we demonstrate a monolithic PSTSC 
with an independently certified PCE of 29.80%.

retention: on the nanotextured sample, we observe a larger roll-off 
angle (25°), which is defined as the tilting angle at which a droplet of 
perovskite solution starts to roll off the surface28, than for the planar 
reference (18°). This indicates the improved ability of the nanotex-
tured surface to retain the perovskite solution. This observation can 
be explained from the approach of de Gennes and co-workers, in which 
the resulting droplet retention force is enhanced by surface roughness 
pinning the three-phase contact line29,30. Such phenomena are a feature 
of pseudo-superhydrophobic surfaces, which exhibit very large contact 
angles, but on which the droplet is pinned by a particular combination 
of material and texture, resulting in an unusually large roll-off angle31. 
We hence regard increased droplet retention on nanotextured surfaces 
as an important factor for our improved fabrication yield.
To further study the morphological properties of perovskite layers 
grown on sinusoidal nanotextures, we captured SEM top-view images (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2), and analysed the projected domain size distribution as 
depicted in Fig. 2f. The domain size distribution is equal with a mean equiva-
lent disk radius of 130 ± 60 nm and 120 ± 60 nm for planar and nanotextured 
silicon bottom cells, respectively. This is not surprising as it was reported 
that with the antisolvent method the crystallization is initiated at the top 
surface, which is not affected by the buried nanotextured interface32.
To gain further understanding of the influence of nanotexture 
on the morphological properties of the perovskite layers, we per-
formed depth-resolved grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering 
(GIWAXS) measurements: representative GIWAXS maps of planar and 
nanotextured samples are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. Figure 2g 
displays the azimuthal intensity profiles of the (100) reflection of per-
ovskite layers deposited onto planar and nanotextured silicon bottom 
cells, averaged over 39 incidence angles (0.1°–2.0°). The perovskite 
deposited onto the planar substrate shows less intense diffraction 
intensities at azimuthal scattering angles (χ) of 70°–90°, resembling 
a previous report for a similar perovskite composition33. In contrast, 
a homogeneous intensity distribution is shown in the perovskite 
deposited on the nanotextured substrate, which indicates a random 
crystallite orientation of perovskite in the bulk and surface. Previous 
studies reported different mechanisms, which can lead to a variation 
of crystal orientation: it can be controlled by the chemical composi-
tion of precursors33,34, the underlying layer35 or by crystal seeds36. It 
was also reported that nanotexturing of perovskite affects the crystal 
orientation37. We further could not detect a notable difference in the 
distribution of lead iodide in perovskite layers deposited on planar and 
nanotextured silicon cells (Supplementary Fig. 4), which could affect 
the optoelectronic properties38.

nanotextured PSTSCs are shown in Fig. 3a; no notable difference can be 
observed in the EQEs of the perovskite. In contrast, the EQEs of the silicon 
subcells differ from each other: the nanotexture diminishes the peaks and 
valleys caused by thin-film interference (green solid line), which occurs 
within the perovskite top cell. In addition, the integrated current densi-
ties (Jph,Si) of the silicon EQEs are similar. In contrast to the EQE measure-
ments, nanotexturing reduces reflectance considerably from 3.30 to 2.82 
mA cm−2 current-density-equivalent. Results from a larger number of pro-
cessed PSTSC devices confirm an average nanotexture-induced reduc-
tion of reflectance of around 0.5 mA cm−2 current-density-equivalent 
(Jph,R) (Fig. 3b). Statistical analysis of the combined photogenerated 
current density (Jph,Pero + Jph,Si) from EQE measurements yields the high-
est values for selected nanotextured devices, confirming their optical 
potential. The average values are 39.15 and 39.47 mA cm−2 for planar and 
nanotextured devices, respectively, demonstrating that nanotextures 
enhance optical device performance (Fig. 3c). The partial compensation 
of optical gain as expected from reflectance might be attributed to col-
lection losses under the low-light conditions of the EQE measurement 
for selected nanotextured silicon bottom cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). 
Nonetheless, the overall high level of optical performance was inde-
pendently confirmed by the EQEs calculated from the relative spectral 
response measurements at Fraunhofer ISE CalLab (see Supplementary 
Fig. 6a,b for certificate and EQE spectra) with photogenerated current 
densities of 20.31 and 19.70 mA cm−2 for perovskite and silicon subcells 
of a nanotextured PSTSC, respectively. Despite the current mismatch, 
which has little affect on the combined photogenerated current density 
(Supplementary Fig. 7), the combined photogenerated current density 
of 40.01 mA cm−2 is among the highest values reported in the literature 
for two-terminal PSTSCs. Higher values have only been demonstrated 
with fully textured PSTSCs (Supplementary Fig. 8)15,16,18.
In view of process robustness we performed a numerical sensitiv-
ity analysis to study the influence of layer thicknesses in the top cell 
on the photogenerated current density. We used data sets obtained 
during a Bayesian optimization based on the finite-element method 
(FEM), which rigorously solves Maxwell’s equations. Figure 3d shows 
a cross section through a meshed unit cell of a nanotextured PSTSC, as 
used in the simulations. A previous study showed no influence of the 
period of sinusoidal textures on the reflectivity of PSTSCs for periods 
ranging from 500 to 1,000 nm (ref. 13). This is in contrast to pyramidal 
textures, which reveal a strong dependence of antireflective effect on 
pyramid size20,21. During the Bayesian optimization, the overall current 
density of the monolithic tandem device was optimized by maximizing 
the minimum of the two subcell photocurrent densities. We assume 
perfect Lambertian light trapping at the rear side of the silicon bottom 
cell without any parasitic absorption such that the following results 
mainly concern the perovskite top-cell layer design. The results of the 
sensitivity analysis are shown in Fig. 3e,f as functions of the perovskite 
and nc-SiOx:H(n) layer thickness, respectively. According to these simu-
lations, the optimized nanotextured PSTSC performs almost the same 
as the optimized planar device with matched photogenerated current 
densities of 20.24 and 20.22 mA cm−2, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3e, the 
sensitivity to a changing perovskite thickness is also similar for the planar 
and nanotextured designs. However, texturing reduces the sensitivity to 
a changing nc-SiOx:H(n) thickness, as seen in Fig. 3f: whereas for planar 
devices the photocurrent density peaks at around 100 nm nc-SiOx:H(n) 
thickness, for the nanotextured design the photocurrent density reaches 
a plateau for nc-SiOx:H(n) layers thicker than 100 nm. This means that 
nanotexturing of the PSTSC widens the process window for the optical 
nc-SiOx:H(n) interlayer, which is an important aspect for industrialization 
of the tandem technology especially when processing on larger areas.

Optoelectronic analysis
Figure 4a shows the current-density/voltage characteristics of repre-
sentative nanotextured and planar PSTSCs. Both devices show PCEs 
(η) above 29% with a JSC of 19.45 mA cm−2. In addition, the fill factor 
(FF) of the planar and nanotextured PSTSC shows similar values. Even 
when considering many devices and the influence of current density 
mismatch ( Jph,Pero − Jph,Si) on the FF (ref. 6), no clear difference can be 
observed between the planar and nanotextured configurations (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9). Alongside the electronic characteristics, we tested 
the stability at maximum power point by subjecting both a planar 
and a nanotextured PSTSC to continuous illumination in a dedicated 
tandem ageing set-up. The observed degradation over time (Sup-
plementary Fig. 10) resembles previous results7. We do not observe 
an effect of nanotextures on the stability of the tandem devices. In 
contrast, the open-circuit voltages (VOC) of planar and nanotextured 
PSTSC differ substantially. Figure 4b displays the VOC of planar (black 
box) and nanotextured (green box) PSTSCs with a perovskite bandgap 
of 1.68 eV. The overall VOC distribution shows higher maximum values 
and a statistical improvement of the median VOC by around 15 mV for 
nanotextured compared with planar PSTSCs. To verify and understand 
this effect, we used a subcell-selective characterization approach 
based on electro- and photoluminescence (EL/PL), which makes it 
possible to assess the charge transport and recombination properties 
of the top and bottom cell and to determine their efficiency potential. 
First, we quantified the injection-dependent electroluminescence 
quantum yield (EQEEL) of both subcells by injecting a current into the 
tandem device and detecting the emitted EL of both subcells. From the  
emitted EL, we calculated the quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLSEL). 
The injection-dependent QFLSEL equals a series-resistance-free  
dark J–V curve, from which we can generate a pseudo-J–V curve by 
adding the generation current39. Figure 4c shows the obtained char-
acteristics of both subcells in the tandem configuration for planar 
and nanotextured PSTSCs. These results reveal an approximately 
~60% enhanced EQEEL in the perovskite subcell for the nanostructured 
PSTSC (Supplementary Fig. 11), which explains the ~15 mV VOC gain in 
the corresponding  J–V measurements. We note that the pseudo-FF 
(pFF) of 84.5% and 84.1% for nanotextured and planar PSTSCs, respec-
tively, clearly surpass the experimental values and thus point to a 
further optimization route for these solar cells (see also the results 
of intensity-dependent  J–V measurements in Supplementary Fig. 12). 
Further, the EL emission of perovskite in the nanotextured devices is 
slightly skewed (Fig. 4c, inset), which might suggest enhanced photon 
recycling40. We note that the implied performance of both silicon 
subcells is identical and that the efficiency potential obtained with 
the nanostructured device is almost 32%. The exact mechanism that 
improves the EQEEL/VOC of the perovskite on the nanotextured silicon 
cell is not yet fully understood. The enhancement might stem from 
an improved optoelectronic quality of the absorber layer, possibly 
related to alterations in the crystal orientation (Fig. 2g). It is known 
that the impact of crystallite orientation on the carrier dynamics 
of layered perovskite is crucial; however, this relation has been the 
subject of controversy for three-dimensional perovskite41. There 
are both research reports claiming that the improved crystallite ori-
entation contributes to improved optoelectronic properties33,42,43, 
and those claiming that there is no clear correlation44. In addition, 
slightly lower non-radiative recombination losses at the interfaces45, 
or an alteration of the optical coupling between the perovskite and 
the silicon46 have also been discussed. In a study by Hou et al., a VOC 
enhancement of the perovskite on textured silicon was related to an 
alteration of the electric fields in the perovskite with extended drift 
regions21. We observe no remarkable difference in the dark currents 
of nanotextured and planar solar cells, and almost no difference in 
the morphology (Fig. 2), hence the higher emission from EL (Fig. 4) 
indicates less non-radiative recombination in nanotextured devices.

High-performance tandem solar cells with 
optically advanced rear reflector
To reduce parasitic absorption losses in the rear reflector, we addition-
ally implemented an RDBL27,47,48. State-of-the-art monofacial silicon het-
erojunction solar cells use a TCO/silver system as reflector. By designing 
a thin TCO layer and at the same time increasing the distance between 
metal and silicon by means of an RDBL, parasitic absorption losses can 
be reduced. Bush et al. integrated such a reflector into a PSTSC, thereby 
increasing the  JSC and efficiency considerably49. Figure 5a,b illustrates 
PSTSC layer stacks with a standard reflector and with an RDBL. Three 
optically different regions can be distinguished: (1) standard reflector 
(120 nm TCO, no buffer layer), (2) RDBL (20 nm TCO, 180 nm SiO2 buffer 
layer) and (3) grid fingers of the RDBL (20 nm TCO, no buffer layer). SEM 
images of the corresponding regions are presented in Supplementary 
Fig. 13. The SiO2 layer thickness and the grid finger pitch were chosen 
according to optical and electrical simulations of the RDBL. To quantify 
the optical properties of these three regions, we performed simula-
tions of the variation of the photogenerated current density in the 
silicon (  Jph,Si) with TCO and SiO2 thickness (Fig. 5c). For the optimized 
layer thicknesses, the photocurrent density of the silicon bottom cell  
Jph,Si increases from 19.4 to 19.7 mA cm−2 when replacing the standard 
reflector design (region 1) with the RDBL (region 2), mostly due to 
reduced parasitic absorption in the TCO–silver contact. A full-area 
design as in the grid finger (region 3) would lead to a Jph,Si of 19.0 mA cm−2.
Finally, the local contact area has to be optoelectronically opti-
mized not only regarding the optical properties, but also in terms of 
lateral transport and contact resistive losses. This means that the TCO 
thickness and the grid finger geometry have to be balanced. Figure 5d  
shows the simulation results (see Methods for details). We find 
decreased power loss with TCO thickness reduction, since the benefit 
from reduced parasitic absorption dominates. For a silver-grid finger 
width of 40 µm we find an optoelectrical optimum for a grid pitch of 
roughly 1.1 mm (Fig. 5d). Hence, a finger pitch of 1 mm was implemented, 
resulting in local contacts covering roughly 4% of the active area. The 
optoelectronic analysis further shows that overall the RDBL poten-
tially increases the power output by 0.3 mW cm−2. The EQE spectra of 
experimentally realized PSTSCs with and without an RDBL are shown in 
Fig. 5e. In addition to the nanotexture-induced flattening of the silicon  
EQE, the RDBL features an increased absorption at the silicon band edge,  
as expected from the optical simulations. To account for the additional  
current density from the RDBL in the silicon subcell, we shifted the  
perovskite bandgap from 1.68 to 1.66 eV. As described by Peña-Camargo  
et al., the optoelectronic properties do not notably change when 
slightly adjusting the perovskite composition50; only the VOC changes 
according to the bandgap. One of the best PSTSCs, featuring both a 
nanotextured interface between the perovskite and silicon subcell and  
an RDBL was sent to Fraunhofer ISE CalLab for indepen­dent certifica­tion 
(Fig. 5f; see Supplementary Fig. 14 for certificate). The cell reached a PCE 
of 29.75% when measured from   JSC to VOC (designated area, 1.0163 cm2), 
with a VOC of 1.92 V, an FF of 79.4% and a   JSC of 19.56 mA cm−2. The  
certified PCE, as determined from MPP tracking, is 29.80%.
Conclusions
In this study, we integrated gentle submicrometre-periodic nano-
textures and an improved back-reflector design into monolithic 
PSTSCs. The nanotextures enable greatly enhanced process yield 
of the solution-processed perovskite top cell from around 50% in 
case of planar to about 95% for nanotextured silicon bottom cells. 
We further observed a reduction of reflection losses amounting to 
around 0.5 mA cm−2 current-density-equivalent. As a result, combined 
short-circuit current densities in the perovskite and silicon subcells 
of up to 40.0 mA cm−2 are observed, which is one of the highest values

reported in the literature for two-terminal PSTSCs. A sensitivity analy-
sis further indicates that the nanotextures substantially improve the 
performance robustness upon deviations from the optimal nanocrys-
talline silicon oxide layer thickness—an important aspect with regards 
to the industrialization of tandem technology and processing on 
larger areas. The main driver for improved PSTSC performance was 
an increase of the open-circuit voltage by around 15 mV that stems, 
according to our subcell-selective EL characterizations, solely from an 
improved perovskite-top-cell performance. In addition to the nano-
textures at the silicon bottom-cell front side, we further implemented 
an RDBL at the rear side. This design further improves the current 
density in the silicon bottom cell by around 0.3 mA cm−2 by reducing 
parasitic absorption losses. By combining nanotextures and RDBL in 
one PSTSC, we achieved a certified PCE of 29.80%. These results pave 
the way for the wide use of nano-optical designs in high-efficiency 
perovskite solar cells and other metal halide perovskite optoelectronic 
devices in the near future.

Nanotextured silicon bottom cells. A three-step process, developed 
by Sutter et al26., was used to create nanotextures in silicon wafers for 
PSTSCs. Sinusoidal master structures, manufactured by laser inter-
ference lithography51, were replicated by nanoimprint lithography 
with a polydimethylsiloxane stamp in an ultraviolet-curable resist 
(mrNIL210–500; Microresist Technologies) on a double side polished 
(100) silicon n-type float-zone wafer (Topsil) with a nominal resistivity 
of 1–5 Ω·cm and an approximate thickness of 280 μm. For the nanoim-
print lithography process, the 4 inch wafers were cleaned according to 
the standard RCA procedure52. In ambient conditions, 700 μl of resist 
was spin-coated for 30 s at 3,200 r.p.m. on the wafer, prebaked for 3 
min at 60 °C and cured by ultraviolet light with the polydimethylsi-
loxane stamp comprising the inverted nanotexture from the master 
on top for 2 min. In a second step, the reproduced nanotexture was 
anisotropically etched into the silicon substrate by reactive-ion etch-
ing with the etching gases sulfur hexafluoride and fluoroform (CHF3) 
for 16 min at 90 W radiofrequency power and 20 mtorr pressure. In 
this step, the nanotextured resist served as a 3D etching mask and was 
able to replicate the texture into the underlying silicon. An additional 
reactive-ion etching oxygen plasma was applied to eliminate organic 
residues. Due to the diffusion of ions and silicon lattice distortion, a 
subsequent wet-chemical defect etch with nitric acid, phosphoric acid 
and fluoric acid (HNO3(65%)/H3PO4(85%)/HF(50%)/H2O, 30:10:1:15) 
was performed. Prior to the texturing of the rear side with random 
pyramids with (111) facets (potassium hydroxide etched, 8 min at 83 °C, 
CellTex Ultra (ICB) as additive), the nanotextured front side was pro-
tected with a 320-nm-thick SiO2 layer deposited by plasma-enhanced 
chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). After removal of the capping in 
HF, a final RCA clean and HF dip (1% dilution in water) were performed. 
Intrinsic and doped hydrogenated amorphous (a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p)) and 
nc-SiOx:H(n) layers were deposited by PECVD using an Applied Materi-
als AKT1600 cluster tool. To account for the enhanced surface area, 
the process parameters for the front side of the nanotextured wafers 
were adjusted by a factor of 1.3 versus the planar case. A 20 nm layer 
of doped indium oxide as TCO was sputtered as the recombination 
contact. The rear-side contact of the silicon bottom cells is 120 nm for 
the standard design and 20 nm sputter-doped indium oxide for the 
RDBL. The RDBL has an additional silver grid printed on the rear side 
with a nominal finger width of 40 µm and a 1 mm pitch, and was cured 
for 10 min at 210 °C, followed by a PECVD deposition of 180 nm SiO2. 
For both standard and RDBL rear-side designs, 400 nm silver was sput-
tered as the back contact layer. In the standard design the silver forms 
a direct contact with the TCO. For the RDBL design the local contacts 
are fabricated at the finger grid printed area through the 180 nm SiO2 
to the silver layer without additional processing steps being needed. All 
contacts of the silicon bottom cell were processed through a quadratic 
mask with an area of 1.1 cm2. After sputtering silver, the silicon wafers 
of the standard design were annealed for 10 min at 210 °C and wafers of 
both designs were additionally annealed for 5 min at 210 °C under 1 sun 
illumination. The wafers were then laser cut into 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 pieces, 
with a 1.1 cm2 contact area in the centre.
For fabricating the perovskite top cells, we adapted a device stack 
reported earlier7. For cleaning, the 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 silicon bottom cells 
were blown with nitrogen, and ethanol was spin-coated at 2,500 r.p.m. 
for 30 s, folllowed by ultraviolet/ozone treatment for 15 min. Further 
processes were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. First, 100 µl 
of a 3 mM solution of Me-4PACz (TCI) was dissolved in ethanol and 
spin-coated (3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s) onto the bottom cells, followed 
by a 10 min annealing at 100 °C. Then, either Cs0.05(FA0.79MA0.21)0.95P
b(I0.79Br0.21)3 (1.66 eV bandgap) or Cs0.05(FA0.77MA0.23)0.95Pb(I0.77Br0.23)3 
(1.68 eV bandgap) perovskite was prepared, adapted from a recipe by 
Saliba et al53. For this, precursor solutions containing formamidinium 
iodide (Dyenamo) and lead iodide (TCI) were mixed in a ratio of 79:21 or 
77:23 with a precursor solution containing methylammonium bromide 
(Dyenamo) and lead bromide (TCI). Both precursor solutions contained 
1 M of the corresponding organic and 1.1 M of the lead salts which 
were dissolved in a mixture of anhydrous dimethylformamide and 
dimethylsulfoxide (4:1 vol/vol; both purchased from Sigma Aldrich). 
Next, 5 vol% caesium iodide (abcr) from a 1.5 M stock solution in DMSO 
was added to the precursor solutions. The resulting perovskite solution 
was then spin-coated at 3,500 r.p.m. for 40 s; 15 s prior to the end of the 
programme, 500 µl ethyl acetate (Sigma Aldrich) was poured onto the 
spinning substrate. The films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The 
front-side contact was deposited through subsequent thermal evapo-
ration of 1 nm lithium fluoride (Sigma Aldrich) and 18 nm C60 (Sigma 
Aldrich). Then, 20 nm tin oxide was deposited by thermal atomic layer 
deposition in an Arradiance GEMStar reactor at 80 °C. A 100 nm layer 
of indium zinc oxide from a 4 inch target (90:10 wt% In3O2:ZnO) was 
deposited by sputtering at a power of 150 W under argon/oxygen. A 
100 nm thick silver frame was thermally evaporated through a shadow 
mask. Finally, 100 nm LiF was thermally evaporated as an antireflective 
coating. The active area is defined by the metal frame and is slightly 
larger than 1 cm2.
Characterization
Roll-off measurements were conducted using a contact angle goniom-
eter (DSA 25, Krüss). In all measurements, 10 µl droplets of perovskite 
solution (see above) were used. For the roll-off angle measurements 
the samples were placed on fixed, inclined stages before dispensing the 
solution. The methodology used here enables qualitative analysis of 
the droplet retention behaviour of both planar and textured surfaces54.
Reflectance was measured under an angle of 8° in 5 nm steps from 
300 to 1,200 nm with a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050+ ultraviolet/visible/
near-infrared spectrophotometer, which was calibrated with a Spec-
tralon. For statistics on the reflectance of PSTSCs, perovskite absorbers 
with bandgaps varying from 1.66 to 1.68 eV were used.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed 
with a XE-70 (Park Systems). For accurate profile scans in the nanometre 
regime, high-aspect-ratio tips were used. SEM was performed with a 
Merlin field emission scanning electron microscope with a Gemini II 
optical column (Zeiss).
Ex situ GIWAXS measurements were conducted at the mySpot 
beamline at the electron storage ring BESSY II. The samples were meas-
ured at room temperature in reflection mode with incidence angles 
from 0.1° to 2° (39 scans, 0.05° interval), using a radiation energy of 
9 keV (λ = 1.378 Å). The size of the beam was around 100 µm (ref. 55). 
The 2D images were plotted and integrated with Dpdak and GIXSGUI 
software56,57.
EL measurements. Absolute EL measurements were performed using 
a calibrated silicon photodetector and a Keithley 485 picoammeter. 
The detector (active area, ∼1 cm2) was placed directly in front of the 
device, and the total photon flux was determined from the emission 
spectra of the perovskite and silicon subcell, and the EQE of the detec-
tor. To selectively pick up EL from the perovskite or crystalline silicon 
subcell, appropriate long-pass and short-pass filters were used. Under-
estimation of the EQEEL due to undetected photons that escaped to the 
side was compensated by additional measurements at different dis-
tances and with a larger detector (active area, ∼2 cm2). During a typical 
EL measurement, a Keithley 2400 source meter was used to apply a 
forward bias to the cell, and the injected current was monitored. Meas-
urements were conducted with a home-written LabVIEW routine. Rela-
tive EL spectra of the PSTSCs were measured with an Andor SR393i-B 
spectrometer equipped with an Andor iDus silicon charge-coupled 
device camera and an iDus InGaAs detector array. The spectral response 
of the system was calibrated by using a calibrated halogen lamp with 
specified spectral irradiance. The quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLSEL) 
was calculated according to QFLSEL = kBT × ln(EQEEL ×
JG
J0,rad ), where kBT

is the thermal energy at room temperature, and J0,rad and JG are the 
radiative recombination current in the dark and the 1-sun-equivalent 
(AM1.5G) generation current, respectively. The quantification of the 
J0,rad of both subcells is shown in Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplemen-
tary Table 1.
Solar cell characteristics. The tandem solar cells were measured in air 
under AM1.5G (1 sun) equivalent illumination with a Wavelabs Sinus-70 
light-emitting diode (LED) class AAA solar simulator as described in a 
previous publication by Al-Ashouri et al.7. The cells were not precondi-
tioned. For calibration we used a slightly modified calibration routine 
as described in ref. 58. We adjusted the spectrum such that it led to the 
photogenerated current densities obtained by EQE measurements for 
both subcells. Thus, for a perovskite-limited cell, we first increased the 
intensity of the blue light to get a silicon-limited cell. Subsequently, the 
near-infrared region was adjusted until the JSC of the silicon-limited 
tandem solar cell was equal to the Jph,Si (calculated from EQE and AM1.5G 
spectrum). Finally, the intensity of the blue light was decreased until 
the tandem solar cell was perovskite-limited again and the JSC was equal 
to the Jph,Pero. For a silicon-limited cell, the procedure is the opposite. 
The backside of the cell was contacted with a metal vacuum chuck at 
25 °C, whereas the front side was contacted with two gold probes. A 
black laser-cut aperture mask covered the substrate outside of the 
active area. The J–V measurements and MPP tracks were recorded 
using ahome-built LabVIEW software. The EQE spectra were recorded 
with a home-built set-up using chopped (79 Hz) monochromatic light 
from a xenon and helium lamp,each covering a specific part of the 
spectrum. To measure the EQE of the perovskite subcell, the silicon 
subcell was saturated using an LED with 850 nm peak emission. To 
maintain short-circuit conditions, a bias voltage of 0.6 V was applied. 
The silicon subcell was measured by saturating the perovskite subcell 
with blue light from an LED (455 nm) and applying a bias voltage of 
1.0 V. For statistics on totalized integrated subcell current densities 
of PSTSCs, perovskite absorbers with bandgaps varying from 1.66 to 
1.68 eV were used.
Simulations
3D optical simulations: JCMwave and Bayesian optimization. The 
data used for the sensitivity analysis presented in Fig. 3 were gen-
erated during a layer-thickness optimization with a Bayesian opti-
mization algorithm59, similar to an optimization we presented in 
previous work13. During the optimization the thicknesses of the per-
ovskite and nc-SiOx:H(n) layers were varied to maximize the function 
min(Jph,pero,Jph,Si), which is a well-suited optimization function for mono-
lithic tandem solar cells, as it directly accounts for current matching60. 
The individual simulations were performed with the FEM solver JCM-
suite61 for a 300–1,190 nm wavelength range and produced absorption 
spectra for all the layers of the solar cell stack. To be able to do the FEM 
simulations, we had to restrict the simulation domain to the perovskite 
top cell and to assume the silicon to be infinitely thick. To compensate, 
we corrected the absorption of the silicon layer by assuming perfect 
light trapping for the silicon wafer according to Tiedje and Yablono-
vitch62. From the absorption spectra, the photocurrent densities were 
calculated60. For example, for reflection the equation is given as
Jph,R = −e
1,190 nm
∫
300 nm
R (λ) × ΦAM1.5G (λ) dλ
where e is the elementary charge, R is the spectral reflectance 
R and Φ is the spectral photon flux under the AM1.5G condi-
tion60. Hence, the current-density equivalents can be regarded as 
solar-spectrum-weighted reflectance values and their relevance for 
the solar cell device can immediately be seen. Details on the layer 
thicknesses, optical material data and optimization results are given 
in Supplementary Table 2.
1D optical simulations: GenPro4. The optical simulations on the RDBL 
shown in Fig. 5c were performed with GenPro4 developed at TU Delft63, 
which uses the net-radiation method and ray tracing for scattering at 
the pyramidal back side of the solar cell. Details on the layer stack used 
for these simulations are given in Supplementary Table 3.
Optoelectrical simulations: Quokka. For the RDBL with local contacts, 
the sheet resistance of the TCO (Rsheet), which depends on its electrical 
properties and thickness, and the resistance of the grid fingers, which 
depends on their pitch, geometry and resistivity, have to be optimized. 
To calculate this balance, electrical simulations were carried out with 
the Quokka3 software64 for which we assumed the wafer properties, 
finger geometry and resistivity, and Si/TCO/Ag contact resistivities 
to remain constant. Note also that Rsheet does not increase linearly with 
thickness reduction since we considered the variation of its electrical 
properties in real-solar-cell-like structures as studied in ref. 27. The 
reference point from which the optical power loss (Ploss) is calculated 
is JSC = 19.73 mA cm−2 at tTCO = 10 nm and FP = 2.5 mm, decreasing to 
19.44 mA cm−2 at tTCO = 200 nm and FP = 0.5 mm. For this JSC range vari-
ation, VOC = 1.9 V and FF = 79.52% are assumed to remain constant. For 
the electrical Ploss, the holes, vertical, lateral and metal finger transport 
losses are calculated assuming JSC has a constant value of 19.4 mA cm−2. 
Other parameters used can be found in Supplementary Table 4.
