Predicting the future 2
Abstract
Predicting the future is a basic problem that people have to solve every day and a
component of planning, decision-making, memory, and causal reasoning. This paper
presents ﬁve experiments testing a Bayesian model of predicting the duration or extent of
phenomena from their current state. This Bayesian model indicates how people should
combine prior knowledge with observed data. Comparing this model with human
judgments provides constraints on possible algorithms that people might use to predict
the future. The experiments examine the eﬀects of multiple observations, the eﬀects of
prior knowledge, and the diﬀerence between independent and dependent observations,
using both descriptions and direct experience of prediction problems. The results indicate
that people integrate prior knowledge and observed data in a way that is consistent with
our Bayesian model, ruling out some simple heuristics for predicting the future. We
suggest some mechanisms that might lead to more complete algorithmic-level accounts.

Making predictions is hard. Especially about the future.
Neils Bohr (or Yogi Berra)
Despite the diﬃculty of predicting the future, we do it eﬀortlessly every day. We are
conﬁdent about being able to predict the durations of events, how much time we will need
to get home after work, and how long it will take to ﬁnish the shopping. In many cases we
have a great deal of information guiding our judgments. However, sometimes we have to
make predictions based upon much less evidence. When faced with new situations our
decisions about how much longer we can expect events to last are based on whatever
evidence is available. When the only information we possess concerns how long a
particular event has lasted until now, predicting the future becomes a challenging
inductive problem.
Being able to predict future events is an important component of many cognitive
tasks. Our expectations about the future are certainly fundamental to planning and
decision making, but inferences about time also play a role in other aspects of cognition.
Anderson’s (1990; Anderson & Schooler, 1991) rational analysis of human memory takes
the fundamental problem of memory to be predicting whether an item will be needed in
the future, with retention favouring those items most likely to be in demand. Assessing
the need for a particular item explicitly involves predicting the future, a problem that
Anderson formulates as a Bayesian inference. Prediction is also intimately related to the
discovery of causal relationships. The regularities induced by causal relationships lead us

Predicting the future 4
to make predictions about future events that can alter our perceptions (Eagleman &
Holcombe, 2002) and result in surprises when our predictions are incorrect (Huettel,
Mack, & McCarthy, 2002).
In this paper, we test the predictions of a model of predicting the future, formulating
the problem as one of Bayesian inference. Our Bayesian model indicates how people
should combine their prior knowledge about a phenomenon with the information provided
by observed data. Prior knowledge is expressed in terms of a probability distribution over
the extent or duration of a phenomenon, while the eﬀect of observations is incorporated
via a statistical argument that is used in cosmology, known as the “anthropic principle”
(Gott, 1993). We explore the predictions of this model in depth and consider their
implications for the psychological mechanisms that might guide human predictions.
In previous work, we showed that people are sensitive to the statistical properties of
everyday quantities in the way that is consistent with our model (Griﬃths & Tenenbaum,
2006). These results indicate that people use prior knowledge, but they do not imply that
people are making predictions by performing the calculations indicated by Bayes’ rule.
Rather, they suggest that whatever algorithm people use for predicting the future, it is
consistent with Bayesian inference in its sensitivity to prior knowledge. Many simple
heuristics might have this property. For example, Mozer, Pashler, and Homaei (2008) have
argued that our results could be explained by people following a simple heuristic, in which
they use only a small number of previous experiences to inform their judgments rather
than having access to the whole probability distribution.
Our goal in this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the extent to which
people’s predictions are consistent with our Bayesian model, and thus to obtain stronger
constraints on the algorithms that they might be using in making these predictions. Our
Bayesian model makes strong predictions about the eﬀects of providing further
observations, how prior knowledge should be combined with these observations, and the

Predicting the future 5
diﬀerence between independent and dependent observations. Each of these predictions
provides an opportunity to identify a constraint that an algorithm would need to satisfy:
If people behave in a way that is consistent with our model in each of these cases, then
whatever algorithm they are using must also approximate Bayesian inference. We test
these predictions empirically, using both cognitive and perceptual judgments about time,
and consider their implications for simple heuristics that people might use in predicting
the future.
Rational models of predicting the future
We begin our analysis by describing the “anthropic principle” used in predicting the
future. We then present the Bayesian generalization of this argument and consider the
eﬀects of manipulating the prior and the likelihood within this model. This leads us to the
model predictions that we test in the remainder of the paper.
The Copernican anthropic principle
The cosmologist J. Richard Gott III (1993) proposed a simple heuristic for
predicting the future which was intended to provide insight into weighty matters like the
prolonged existence of the human race, but to be just as valid when applied to matters
arising in everyday life. Gott’s heuristic is based on the “Copernican anthropic principle,”
which holds that
. . . the location of your birth in space and time in the Universe is priveleged (or
special) only to the extent implied by the fact that you are an intelligent
observer, that your location among intelligent observers is not special but
rather picked at random (1993, p. 316)
Gott extends this principle to reasoning about our position in time – given no evidence to
the contrary, we should not assume that we are in a “special” place in time. If we adopt

Predicting the future 6
this principle, the time at which an observer encounters a phenomenon should be
randomly located in the total duration of that phenomenon.1
This principle leads to a simple method for predicting the future: discover how long
a phenomenon has endured until the moment it was observed and predict that it should
last that long into the future. This follows from the anthropic principle because if you
assume you encounter a phenomenon at a random point, it is equally likely you observed
it in the ﬁrst or second half of its total duration. Denoting the time between the start of a
phenomenon and its observation tpast and its total duration ttotal, a good guess is
ttotal = 2 tpast. The argument works just as well if you know how far a phenomenon will
extend into the future (for example if you see a sign that is counting down to some event),
but do not know how far it extends into the past. Again, you should guess ttotal = 2 tfuture.
For simplicity, we will focus on predicting ttotal from tpast for the remainder of this section.
More formally, Gott’s rule can be justiﬁed by a probabilistic analysis that he calls
the “delta t argument”. If we deﬁne the ratio
r = tpast
ttotal
,
(1)
the Copernican anthropic principle tells us that r should be uniformly distributed between
0 and 1. This lets us make probabilistic predictions about the value of r. In particular,
the probability that r < 0.5 is 0.5, so there is a 50% chance that ttotal > 2 tpast. Likewise,
there is a 50% chance that ttotal < 2 tpast, making ttotal = 2 tpast a good guess. We can
also use this argument to deﬁne conﬁdence intervals over the durations of events by
evaluating conﬁdence intervals on r. For example, r will be between 0.025 and 0.975 with
a probability of 0.95, meaning that with 95% conﬁdence
1
39tpast < tfuture < 39tpast,

Predicting the future 7
where tfuture = ttotal −tpast.
This method of reasoning has been used to predict a wide range of phenomena.
Gott (1993) gives the example of the Berlin Wall, which he ﬁrst encountered in 1969. At
this point the Berlin Wall had been in existence for 8 years, so tpast is 8 years. The 95%
conﬁdence interval on the future duration of the Berlin Wall, tfuture, based upon the
assumption that Gott’s visit was randomly located in the period of its existence is 2.46
months to 312 years, ﬁrmly containing the actual tfuture of 20 years. Gott made similar
calculations of tfuture for Stonehenge, the journal Nature, the U.S.S.R., and even the
human race (the good news is that a 95% conﬁdence interval gives us at least 5, 100 years,
the bad news is that it also predicts less than 7.8 million). The principle has subsequently
been applied to a surprisingly broad range of targets, including predicting the run of
Broadway musicals (Landsberg, Dewynne, & Please, 1993).
A Bayesian approach to predicting the future
Gott’s (1993) Copernican anthropic principle suggests how we might formulate a
rational statistical account of our ability to predict the future, but the context in which
we make our daily predictions diﬀers from that assumed by Gott in two important ways:
prior knowledge and multiple observations. In many cases in the real world where it might
be desirable to predict the future, we know more than simply how long a process has been
underway. In particular, our interaction with the world often gives us some prior
expectations about the duration of an event. For example, meeting a 78 year-old man on
the street, we are unlikely to think that there is a 50% chance that he will be alive at the
age of 156 (for a similar example, see Jaynes, 2003). Likewise, our predictions are often
facilitated by the availability of multiple observations of a phenomenon. For example, if
we were attempting to determine the period that passes between subway trains arriving at
a station, we would probably have several trips upon which to base our judgment. If on

Predicting the future 8
our ﬁrst trip we discovered that a train had left the station 103 seconds ago, we might
assume that trains run every few minutes. But, after three trips yield trains that have left
103, 34, and 72 seconds ago, this estimate might get closer to 103 seconds. And after ten
trains, all leaving less than 103 seconds before we arrive, we might be inclined to accept a
value very close to 103 seconds.
Gott’s (1993) delta-t argument does not incorporate the prior knowledge about
durations that people bring to the problem of predicting the future, or the possibility of
multiple observations. However, it can be shown that the delta-t argument is equivalent to
a simple Bayesian analysis of the problem of predicting the future (Gott, 1994). Bayesian
inference naturally combines prior knowledge with information from one or many
observations, making it possible to extend Gott’s argument to provide a more general
account of predicting the future. Bayes’ rule states that
P(h|d) = P(d|h)P(h)
P(d)
,
(2)
where h is some hypothesis under consideration and d is the observed data. By
convention, P(h|d) is referred to as the posterior probability of the hypothesis, P(h) the
prior probability, and P(d|h) the likeliihood, giving the probability of the data under the
hypothesis. The denominator P(d) can be obtained by summing across P(d|h)P(h) for all
hypotheses, giving
P(hi|d) =
P(d|hi)P(hi)
R
H P(d|h)P(h)dh,
(3)
where H is the set of all hypotheses.
In responding to a criticism oﬀered by Buch (1994), Gott (1994) noted that his
method for predicting the future could be expressed in Bayesian terms. In this setting, the
data are the observation of the current duration of a phenomenon, tpast, and the
hypotheses concern its total duration, ttotal. Using the prior P(ttotal) ∝
1
ttotal and the

Predicting the future 9
likelihood P(tpast|ttotal) =
1
ttotal if ttotal ≥tpast (and 0 otherwise) yields the same results as
his original formulation of the delta t argument.2 This can be seen if we substitute Gott’s
choices of prior and likelihood into Equation 3,
P(ttotal|tpast) =
1
t2
total
R ∞
tpast
1
t2
total dttotal
,
(4)
which yields
P(ttotal|tpast) = tpast
t2
total
.
(5)
The probability that an observed phenomenon will have ttotal > t for t ≥tpast can be
obtained by integrating this density over all values of ttotal > t:
P(ttotal > t|tpast)
=
Z ∞
t
tpast
t2
total
dttotal
=
tpast
t
.
(6)
This is exactly the probability we would obtain via the delta-t argument: asking whether
ttotal > t is equivalent to asking whether r < tpast
t
and the result follows directly from the
fact that r is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
These choices for the likelihood and the prior are not arbitrary. The Copernican
anthropic principle determines the likelihood: If we encounter a phenomenon at a random
point in its duration, then its current duration, tpast is uniformly distributed between zero
and its total duration, ttotal. Consequently, P(tpast|ttotal) =
1
ttotal for all tpast less than
ttotal. The prior reﬂects the minimal possible state of knowledge about ttotal. Using
1
ttotal
for the prior avoids building any sense of scale into the predictions: It gives the same
amount of probability to a region even if the scale is transformed multiplicatively. For
example, it gives the same probability to ttotal taking a value between 1 and 2 minutes, 1
and 2 hours, and 1 and 2 years. This kind of prior, which gives very little information

Predicting the future 10
about the value of ttotal, is known as an “uninformative” prior (Press, 1989; Jeﬀreys,
1961). This choice of prior leads to the scale-free character of the predictions made by
Gott’s rule: ttotal is predicted to be a constant multiple of tpast, regardless of the value
that tpast takes on. By not imposing a natural scale, the same simple rule can produce
predictions for phenomena that have values of tpast ranging from a few seconds to
hundreds of thousands of years, but it also leads to counter-intuitive conclusions in
contexts where a natural scale does seem to apply, as with the human lifespan.
Changing the prior and likelihood
Crucially, both the prior and the likelihood used in this Bayesian analysis can be
altered to accommodate situations in which we have more knowledge, either as a result of
previous experiences with similar phenomena or having the opportunity to make multiple
observations. Griﬃths and Tenenbaum (2006) explored the eﬀects that prior knowledge of
the duration and extent of everyday quantities has on predicting the future. Figure 1
shows the distributions of ﬁve everyday quantities – human lifespans, the runtimes of
movies, the box oﬃce gross of movies, the length of poems, and the time served by
members of the United States House of Representatives. These quantities have diﬀerent
distributions, which translate into diﬀerent predictions. Our Bayesian analysis can be
applied in all these cases, with the modiﬁcation of tpast and ttotal to refer to the observed
and total extent of phenomena respectively (such as an amount of money, or the number
of lines of text), not just their duration.
We can examine the consequences of using diﬀerent priors looking at how the
posterior median – the value t such that it is equally likely that the total duration is
greater than or less than t, with P(ttotal > t|tpast) = P(ttotal < t|tpast) = 0.5 – changes as a
function of the current duration tpast. This “prediction function” takes on a diﬀerent
shape for diﬀerent priors. Human life spans and movie runtimes roughly follow Gaussian

Predicting the future 11
distributions, with
P(ttotal) =
1
√
2πσe−(ttotal−µ)2/2σ2,
(7)
where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution respectively. The
resulting prediction function picks values of ttotal close to the mean of the prior when tpast
is small, and then predicts a value slightly greater than tpast as tpast becomes large. Movie
grosses and the length of poems follow power-law distributions, with
P(ttotal) ∝t−γ
total,
(8)
where γ is a parameter of the distribution. The resulting prediction function suggests that
ttotal will be 21/γtpast (see Griﬃths & Tenenbaum, 2006, for derivations of the results in
this paragraph). The predicted value is thus simply a multiple of tpast, as in Gott’s rule,
although the multiplier depends on the shape of the distribution. The time spent in the
House of Representatives roughly follows an Erlang distribution
P(ttotal) = ttotale−ttotal/β
β2
,
(9)
where β is a parameter. This distribution has a broad peak at ttotal = β and decays to
zero at 0 and ∞. The resulting prediction function indicates that ttotal will be slightly
larger than tpast, with the predicted value being tpast + β log 2.
Figure 1 also shows the predictions made by human participants in an experiment
where each participant was asked to make a prediction based on a single value of tpast for
a subset of these phenomena. In aggregate, these predictions were in remarkably close
correspondence with the predictions made by our Bayesian model, with the median
human judgment being close to the median of the posterior distribution. However, Mozer
et al. (2008) argued that these results do not provide deﬁnitive evidence that people had

Predicting the future 12
detailed knowledge of the underlying prior distribution. Mozer et al. showed that a
heuristic in which each participant only has access to k samples from the prior and then
makes a prediction corresponding to the smallest of these samples that is greater than tpast
– the Mink heuristic – can produce similarly good approximations to our Bayesian model,
when aggregated across many simulated participants. If people are using this heuristic,
they may have less detailed knowledge of the distribution of events than our original
results suggested. In addition, while the Mink heuristic approximates our Bayesian model
in this particular case, it does not incorporate assumptions about how tpast is sampled or
indicate how observations and prior knowledge should be combined more generally, so it
will diﬀer from our Bayesian model in other settings. We have elsewhere argued that
people’s prior knowledge of the distributions of everyday quantities goes beyond a few
samples (Lewandowsky, Griﬃths, & Kalish, 2009) and shown that there are circumstances
under which approximating Bayesian computations with small samples can be rational
(Shi, Griﬃths, Feldman, & Sanborn, in press; Vul, Goodman, Griﬃths, & Tenenbaum,
2009). In this paper, we will turn to the question of whether people’s judgments remain
consistent with our Bayesian model for more complex prediction problems.
Bayesian models indicate not just how prior knowledge should be used, but how this
knowledge should be integrated with observed data. The experiments we present in this
paper thus focus on examining how people combine prior knowledge with observations in
predicting the future. One property of our Bayesian model, but not of heuristic accounts
such as Gott’s delta-t argument or the Mink heuristic proposed by Mozer et al. (2008), is
that the number of observations of the current duration of a phenomenon people see
should aﬀect their predictions. This is most applicable for cyclic phenomena, where ttotal
represents the interval between instances of a recurring event. For example, we might try
to estimate how often trains run on a particular subway line based on having waited for
trains on multiple occasions. The Copernican anthropic principle determines the

Predicting the future 13
probability of a set of observations of this kind in exactly the same way that it determines
the probability of a single observation. We will use T to denote a set of n times drawn
independently and uniformly at random from the total duration of a phenomenon, as
might occur when waiting for a train n diﬀerent times on the same subway line. Then,
taking tpast to be the largest value in T, we have
P(T|ttotal) =








1
ttotal
n
ttotal ≥tpast
0
otherwise
(10)
where n appears in the exponent because the probabilities of independent events multiply
and each observation has probability
1
ttotal . This equation says that for any total duration
ttotal any set of observations less than ttotal is equally likely, but the probability of the set
of observations decreases as ttotal increases, favoring values of ttotal that are closer to tpast.
As the number of observations increases, so does the preference for smaller values of ttotal.
Changing the prior and likelihood used in our Bayesian model has important
implications for the resulting predictions. We can see some of these implications by
examining the eﬀects of these changes on the posterior median t when we manipulate tpast
and the number of examples (n = 1, 3, 10). The predictions of Gott’s (1993) delta-t
argument, presented in Equation 1, are shown in Figure 2 (a). The predictions are
unaﬀected by n and are thus constant at t = 2tpast, a consequence of the fact that the
simple form of the delta-t argument is not designed to take into account situations in
which multiple observations are available. The predictions that result from following this
heuristic are also insensitive to prior information, oﬀering a single prediction for all
situations. This seems to defy intuition and is the weakest of the models we will consider.
At the next level of complexity is a Bayesian model with
1
ttotal for the likelihood of a
single example and the uninformative prior P(ttotal) ∝
1
ttotal . As shown in Figure 2 (b), the
model shows an eﬀect of the number of examples, resulting from the fact that the

Predicting the future 14
likelihood of n independent examples is (
1
ttotal )n. The exponent in the likelihood gives
smaller durations more weight as the number of examples increases, reducing the estimate
of t. The curve shown in the ﬁgure corresponds to the prediction t = 21/ntpast,
approaching tpast as n becomes large. This reduction in t makes intuitive sense: Consider
the problem of predicting the time that passes between trains discussed at the start of this
section: An initial tpast of 103 seconds suggests ttotal is a few minutes, but seeing more
examples, each less than 103 seconds, brings our estimate much closer to tpast. The main
problem with this model is that it does not make use of the ﬂexibility provided by the
inclusion of prior knowledge in inference.
While we should certainly use precise information about the distribution of ttotal if
available (as was done in Griﬃths & Tenenbaum, 2006), in general we can use a simpler
prior to impose some sense of scale on the predictions. In the remainder of the paper, we
will use an Erlang distribution as a prior (Equation 9). This parameterized peaked
distribution provides a simple way to summarize many of the kinds of distributions that
might be encountered across temporal domains and to explore the results of manipulating
diﬀerent aspects of the model. Of the everyday quantities considered by Griﬃths and
Tenenbaum (2006), two were well-described by an Erlang distribution (length of terms in
the United States House of Representatives and the durations of reigns of pharaohs in
Ancient Egypt). The use of an informative prior imposes a natural scale on a
phenomenon, meaning that people’s predictions about ttotal are no longer simply a ﬁxed
multiple of tpast. Figure 2 (c) shows the predicted values of ttotal are shown for 1, 3, and
10 observations using an Erlang prior where the maximum value of tpast is varied but β is
held constant. As tpast increases, the ratio of the predicted value of ttotal to tpast decreases,
providing a clear pattern indicating the use of an informative prior.

Predicting the future 15
Model predictions
Our Bayesian model of predicting the future has several properties that discriminate
it from existing heuristic accounts, such as the rule proposed by Gott (1993) or the Mink
heuristic proposed by Mozer et al. (2008). Exploring the extent to which people’s
judgments are consistent with these properties provides constraints on algorithms that
could be used to explain how people predict the future. Each point of consistency
highlights a property that a heuristic account must possess, and makes it more challenging
to deﬁne a single simple heuristic that might explain people’s behavior.
The most important property of our Bayesian model is its treatment of multiple
observations. The tightening of predictions about tpast is a direct consequence of the
Copernican anthropic principle and plays an important role in models of human
generalization and word learning in the form of the “size principle” (Tenenbaum &
Griﬃths, 2001; Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007a, 2007b). As more observations less than tpast are
obtained, predictions should converge towards the smallest possible value of ttotal that is
greater than tpast. The equivalent statistical structure of predicting the future and
generalization also suggest that this phenomenon should be observed whether a judgment
is about time or some other quantity for which the same set of hypotheses (ie. intervals
from 0 to some upper limit) is appropriate, such as healthy levels of a toxin (where small
amounts are presumably not dangerous, but there is some point at which it becomes a risk
to health).
Our Bayesian model also asserts that manipulating the prior probability distribution
across the hypothesis space will produce a general change in predictions, at least until the
eﬀect of the priors is overwhelmed by the likelihoods. In particular, inducing a prior
preference for a relatively high value of ttotal will bias inferences towards hypotheses
around that value. Griﬃths and Tenenbaum (2006) showed that people are sensitive to
the distribution of everyday quantities when they make predictions, meaning that they

Predicting the future 16
make use of prior knowledge. However, our Bayesian model also makes clear quantitative
predictions about how this prior knowledge of durations should be combined with the
information provided by multiple observations: As the number of observations increases,
the inﬂuence of prior knowledge should decrease, with judgments becoming more similar
regardless of priors. These predictions are not consistent with simple heuristic accounts.
Use of Gott’s rule cannot predict any eﬀect of prior knowledge. If the biasing information
is not provided in terms of samples from the prior, it is hard to see how it could be
explained by the Mink heuristic. Since neither of these heuristics can handle multiple
observations, they also cannot predict the diminishing eﬀect of prior knowledge as the
number of observations increases.
Finally, the eﬀect of multiple observations under our Bayesian model should be
sensitive to the process by which the observations were generated. In particular, we
should only expect a rapid reduction in the extent of generalization if a set of observations
are probabilistically independent. If the observations are dependent, then successive pieces
of data will not reduce our predictions about ttotal. For example, imagine we were trying
to predict how long Stonehenge would continue to exist. The ﬁrst time we visit provides
an observation of tpast from which we can extrapolate ttotal. Each subsequent visit gives us
a new value for tpast, but these visits do not provide independent observations: If
Stonehenge existed at the most recent value of tpast, it must also have existed at all
smaller values. This corresponds to using the likelihood function
P(T|ttotal) =


(11)
for a set of observations T with maximum value tpast. Using this likelihood function we
should not reduce our estimate of ttotal each time we visit Stonehenge, as we would if we
were using the likelihood given in Equation 10, which assumes independent observations.

Predicting the future 17
This prediction falls out of the statistical analysis of the prediction problem and is hard to
explain unless people are sensitive to the way in which the data they observe are sampled.
Interestingly, previous research has provided both positive and negative results concerning
people’s sensitivity to dependence between observations: Xu and Tenenbaum (2007a)
found evidence that children are sensitive to the way in which examples are sampled in
learning words, while Barsalou, Huttenlocher, and Lamberts (1998) found that adults can
fail to use such information in learning categories.
Our Bayesian model has three clear implications for the kind of judgments that
people should produce when reasoning about the duration of events. The eﬀect of multiple
observations, integration of prior probabilities, and impact of independent observations
are all important properties of how these judgments are made. These predictions provide
an opportunity to identify constraints on algorithms that people could be using in
predicting the future and are inconsistent with existing heuristic accounts. Experiments
1-3 examine these predictions in turn, using a task in which people read about the
durations of events and then form predictions. Experiments 4 and 5 supplement these
results with a task in which people actually experience events of diﬀerent durations and
form their predictions on the basis of this perceptual experience.
Experiment 1: Multiple observations
The ﬁrst experiment examined the eﬀect of introducing multiple observations into
problems of predicting the future and compared the resulting predictions with judgments
made in non-temporal domains. The aim was to evaluate whether our Bayesian model
could provide a good account of these judgments and to examine the correspondence
between predicting the future and other problems of generalization.

Predicting the future 18
Method
Participants. Participants were 81 undergraduates participating for partial course
credit. The participants were randomly assigned to four conditions, to give 21 participants
in the Teacake condition, 21 in the Train condition, 16 in the Toxin condition, and 23 in
the Taxicab condition.
Stimuli. A simple questionnaire format was used, examining four scenarios in which
inductive decisions were required, two of which involved temporal judgments. Each
questionnaire had three sections. The ﬁrst section outlined the situation and give a single
number on which judgments were to be based. This summary was intended to establish a
context for the judgment and to provide some information relevant to forming reasonable
prior expectations. The second and third sections added further information, giving a
total of three numbers and ten numbers respectively.
The ﬁrst scenario, Teacake, described a coﬀee shop that had recently started selling
teacakes. The situation was described as follows:
Each day, on your way to class, you walk past a coﬀee shop. The shop has
recently started a new advertising campaign: they bake fresh teacakes
regularly throughout the day, and have a clock outside that shows how long it
has been since the teacakes were taken out of the oven. You are interested in
buying a teacake as soon as it is removed from the oven, and wonder how often
batches of teacakes are baked. Today, the clock shows that it has been 34
minutes since the last batch of teacakes was removed from the oven.
The story gives tpast and participants were asked to predict ttotal. Speciﬁcally, they were
asked:
Please write down your best guess of how much time elapses between batches
of teacakes, in minutes. Try to make a guess, even if you feel like you don’t

Predicting the future 19
have enough information to make a decision – just go with your gut feeling.
You may assume that the batches of teacakes are always separated by the
same amount of time.
The second and third sections added further times. The second section read:
Suppose that you check the clock on your way to class for the next two days.
Each time, you note how long it has been since the teacakes came out of the
oven. Including the ﬁrst day, the times you have seen are 34, 8, and 21 minutes.
Participants were then asked exactly the same question about the time between batches of
teacakes. Finally, the third section read:
Suppose that you note the time on the clock every time you walk past the
coﬀee shop in the next week, checking how long it has been since the teacakes
came out of the oven. Including the three days from the previous week, the
times you have seen are 34, 8, 21, 18, 2, 5, 27, 22, 10 and 14 minutes.
This was followed by the same question about the time between batches of teacakes.
The second scenario, the Train scenario, outlined a similar situation in the domain
of public transport:
Imagine that you are visiting a foreign country, and want to catch a subway
train. Your guidebook says that the subway service is very eﬃcient, with trains
running to ﬁxed schedules, guaranteeing that you won’t have to wait very long
at the station. The book doesn’t mention how much time passes between
trains, so you will have to try to guess. When you get to the station, you see a
clock on the wall indicating that the next train will arrive in 103 seconds.
Here, the clock provides tfuture and participants are asked to predict ttotal. As noted
above, our Bayesian model does not diﬀerentiate between tpast and tfuture, as they are both

Predicting the future 20
observations of a period less than ttotal assumed to be uniformly distributed between 0
and ttotal. We thus expect these predictions to be captured by our model in the same way
as the predictions based on tpast from the ﬁrst scenario. Participants were then asked to
write down their best guess of how much time passes between successive trains. The
second and third sections introduced additional observations of 34 and 72 seconds, then
61, 17, 29, 101, 97, 42 and 52 seconds, respectively.
These scenarios were complemented with two analogous situations that made no
reference to time. The ﬁrst asked people to estimate what levels of a toxin might be
healthy. The description of the Toxin scenario was:
On a visit to the doctor, you undergo a range of tests. In one case, the doctor
informs you that he is testing for levels of a certain environmental toxin in
your blood. He has a chart that indicates healthy levels of environmental
toxins, but you can’t quite read the numbers indicating the threshold between
healthy and unhealthy amounts. The doctor tells you that you need only get
another appointment if the test suggests that you have unhealthy levels of
toxin in your blood. When you go in to pick up your results, you ﬁnd a stack
of reports that have been classiﬁed as “healthy”. You are relieved to ﬁnd your
report in the “healthy” stack. You see that the concentration listed on your
report is 34 ng/mL.
Participants were then asked to give their best guess of the highest concentration of the
toxin that would be considered healthy. Subsequent information was introduced in the
next two sections, with additional observations of 8 and 21 ng/mL, then 18, 2, 5, 27, 22,
10 and 14 ng/mL.
The second comparison scenario was a version of the Jeﬀreys (1961) tramcar
problem: participants were told the serial number of a taxicab (as well as being given the
information that all cabs are given a unique number between 1 and the total number of

Predicting the future 21
cabs in the company) and asked to guess the number of cabs in the company (the
presentation of the problem in terms of taxicabs was inspired by Jaynes 1994). The
Taxicab scenario gave participants the information shown below.
Imagine that your business requires you to travel by train to a certain town or
city for ten weeks. When the train pulls up at the station, you get into the ﬁrst
taxicab you ﬁnd. As you get into the cab, you notice a serial number on the
rear fender of your cab. You are curious about this, and ask the driver how the
cabs are labelled. He tells you that each cab is given a unique number between
1 and the total number of cabs in the company, and that each number in that
range corresponds to a cab. The serial number of this particular cab is 103.
Participants were asked to estimate the total number of cabs in the company. Additional
observations were introduced in the next two sections, with numbers 34 and 72, then 61,
17, 29, 101, 97, 42 and 52.
For each of the scenarios, the ﬁrst number given was the largest, meaning that
further observations would only tighten the range of generalization. The largest example
was 34 minutes (ng/mL) for the Teacake (Toxin) scenario, and 103 seconds (cabs) for the
Train (Taxicab) scenario. These values were selected based on an expectation that they
would be broadly consistent with people’s expectations for these quantities. As can be
seen above, the sets of numbers given were identical for the teacake and toxin scenarios
and the train and taxicab scenarios. The numbers after the ﬁrst were approximately
uniformly distributed and were selected to suggest a random sampling process.
Procedure. Each participant received a questionnaire containing all three sections on
a single sheet. At the top of the sheet was the statement “Please answer each question
before going on to the next, and do not go back and change your answers.” in boldface.
These instructions were the same for all four conditions.

Predicting the future 22
Results and Discussion
Plausible responses to these problems are constrained to be greater than the largest
example provided, so participants who produced responses less than tpast were viewed as
not having understood the task and omitted from the analysis. This criterion eliminated
approximately 15% of the participants in each of Experiments 1-3. Inspection of
participants who were rejected suggested that they were either giving estimates of the
spacing between observations, or of the central tendency of the observations, consistent
with two possible misunderstandings of the instructions. Responses more than three
standard deviations from the mean were considered outliers and were also excluded. Only
one outlier was identiﬁed in the course of Experiments 1-3. Responses were transformed to
t
tpast , where t is the raw score and tpast is the largest example.
A one-way within-subjects ANOVA showed a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of the
number of examples for each scenario (F(2, 30) = 9.71, MSE = 0.23, F(2, 32) = 18.00,
MSE = 2.39, F(2, 44) = 9.57, MSE = 3.69, F(2, 30) = 15.05, MSE = 0.017, for the
Teacake, Train, Taxicab, and Toxin scenarios respectively, all p < .001). Means and
standard errors are shown in Figure 3, which demonstrate that all four scenarios show a
similar eﬀect of new information. The ﬁgure also shows ﬁts generated by our Bayesian
model, using the Erlang prior with β estimated for each scenario by minimizing the sum
of the normalized squared errors to the human data (ie. taking the diﬀerence between the
model prediction and the mean of the human data for each point, dividing by the
standard error for that mean, then summing over points). The parameterization of the
distribution reﬂects the diﬀerent priors that might exist across diﬀerent scenarios, relative
to the scale of the examples selected. The values of β for the Teacake, Train, Toxin and
Taxicab scenarios were 1.6, 5.4, 0.7 and 4.4 times the maximum of tpast respectively. The
peak of the Erlang prior is at ttotal = β, yielding values of 54 minutes between batches of
teacakes, 9 minutes 21 seconds between trains, 24 ng/mL of toxin, and 460 taxicabs, all of

Predicting the future 23
which seem appropriate.
The results are consistent with the predicted eﬀect of multiple observations: smaller
predictions were made as more observations were provided. This eﬀect appeared in both
the temporal and the non-temporal tasks, as might be expected if we view all four tasks as
instances of Bayesian inference. This pattern of behavior indicates that people update
their beliefs as they receive additional observations, something that is not accommodated
by existing heuristics. The variation in the absolute magnitude of responses across
diﬀerent tasks is also consistent with using an informative prior. Under the prior used by
Gott (1994), we would not expect to see such variation. Experiment 2 explores the issue of
priors in more detail, examining whether priors can also be manipulated within scenarios.
Experiment 2: Priors
Griﬃths and Tenenbaum (2006) explored the basic prediction that results from
taking a Bayesian approach to predicting the future, showing that prior knowledge about
the distribution of durations inﬂuences people’s predictions. Experiment 1 provided
further support for this idea, showing that there was variation in people’s predictions
across scenarios, which can be captured in the diﬀerent distributions assumed for ttotal in
our model. However, there are still two important questions to address related to the use
of prior knowledge in predicting the future, concerning how such knowledge is represented
and how it is combined with multiple observations. Experiment 2 explores these questions.
The question of how prior knowledge of durations is represented is relevant to
understanding what kinds of algorithms might allow people to predict future events. The
Mink heuristic proposed by Mozer et al. (2008) assumes that people have access to
samples from the probability distribution P(ttotal) associated with the quantity to be
predicted. While this may be a reasonable assumption for some of the everyday prediction
problems considered by Griﬃths and Tenenbaum (2006), it is clear that people can also

Predicting the future 24
make predictions in contexts where they might not have direct experience. Experiment 2
uses a simple manipulation of prior knowledge, providing instructions that modify people’s
expectations, which is harder to account for in terms of drawing upon some stored set of
samples of ttotal.
The question of how prior knowledge is combined with multiple observations
provides a further opportunity to examine whether people form predictions in a way that
is consistent with Bayesian inference. The experiment conducted by Griﬃths and
Tenenbaum (2006) asked participants to make a prediction based on only one observation.
The results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that people can take into account information
from multiple observations and seem to do so in a way that is consistent with Bayesian
inference, reducing their predictions towards a value that is the largest observation so far
as the number of observations increases. This is the result of the likelihood function
(Equation 10) asserting a stronger preference for smaller values of ttotal as n increases and
should thus appear independently of manipulation of the prior. Experiment 2 tests this by
providing multiple observations, in addition to manipulating the prior.
The basic strategy we adopted for exploring manipulations of people’s priors was to
provide our participants with information that we expected should aﬀect their priors,
obtain predictions with diﬀerent numbers of observations and then ﬁt our Bayesian model
to these results to estimate a prior distribution. We could then check whether the change
in the inferred prior distributions was consistent with the change that should have been
produced by the information that we provided to our participants.
Method
Participants. Participants were 78 undergraduates participating for partial course
credit. The participants were randomly assigned to four conditions. The Teacake No Prior
condition had 17 participants, Teacake Prior had 16, Train No Prior had 22, and Train

Predicting the future 25
Prior had 23.
Stimuli. The Teacake and Train scenarios from Experiment 1 were used, together
with two new scenarios. The new scenarios gave participants information that was
designed to alter their prior before they were given speciﬁc numbers upon which a
prediction could be based. The sentence “A friend who you are walking with says that he
worked in a coﬀee shop in the same chain last year, and that shops usually bake every two
hours, although it varies from shop to shop” was added to the teacake scenario, and “In
the course of your travels, you have noticed that most subway trains in this country run
approximately every seven minutes, although it varies from place to place” to the train
scenario. Both pieces of information were intended to increase the durations people would
expect for these scenarios, being greater than the estimated mode in Experiment 1. These
new scenarios were termed Teacake Prior and Train Prior, while the original scenarios are
Teacake No Prior and Train No Prior. All scenarios asked for predictions with 1, 3, and
10 examples, using the same numbers as those presented in the stimuli for Experiment 1.
Procedure. The procedure was the same as for Experiment 1.
Results and Discussion
Responses were screened using the same procedure as in Experiment 1. The
scenarios were grouped into Teacake and Train and examined for the eﬀect of number of
examples and manipulating priors using two-way within-between ANOVAs. The Teacake
scenarios showed an eﬀect of the number of examples (F(2, 42) = 25.87, MSE = 0.27,
p < .001) and manipulating priors (F(1, 21) = 4.70, MSE = 1.72, p < .05), as well as an
interaction between the two (F(2, 42) = 3.80, p < .05). Similar results were shown for the
Train scenarios. There was a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of the number of examples
(F(2, 68) = 50.31, MSE = 0.62 p < .001), as well as an eﬀect of manipulating priors
(F(1, 34) = 5.85, MSE = 1.58, p < .05). In both groups the eﬀect of the number of

Predicting the future 26
examples replicates the results of Experiment 1, and the higher means for the group given
the raised prior is consistent with the predictions of our Bayesian model.
Means and standard errors are shown in Figure 4, together with the model ﬁts,
obtained via the same method as used in Experiment 1. The β values used in ﬁtting the
data were 1.6, 3.3, 3.25, and 3.85 for the Teacake No Prior, Teacake Prior, Train No
Prior, and Train Prior conditions respectively. The β values are greater in the conditions
where the prior was raised, and give peak values of 1 hour, 52 minutes for the teacakes
and 6 minutes 40 seconds for the trains. It is notable that these values are within 10% of
the priors supplied in the experimental materials, supporting the eﬃcacy of the
manipulation and the appropriateness of the model.
Experiment 3: Independence
Experiments 1 and 2 required participants to respond to a sequence of observations
in which they see the largest value, make a response, see two smaller values, make another
response, then see another seven values smaller than the ﬁrst before making a third
response. While we interpret the decreasing trends observed in all three experiments as a
rational statistical inference, a possible confound in these experiments is that the largest
observation was always presented ﬁrst. This suggests that participants might be applying
an “anchoring and adjustment” heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Speciﬁcally,
participants form an estimate after the ﬁrst section of the questionnaire, use this estimate
as an anchor, and then adjust downwards as more information becomes available.
Experiment 3 was designed to obtain further constraints on heuristics that people
might be using to make predictions. The experiment had two diﬀerences from
Experiments 1 and 2. First, it used a between-subjects design in which each participant
saw a single set of numbers (containing 1, 3, or 10 examples). The between-subjects
design was intended to remove the opportunity for people to adjust their judgments

Predicting the future 27
between responses: The largest observation was always presented last and each participant
made only a single response, so the task demands no longer made an explicit strategy of
this kind attractive. Second, we manipulated the dependency structure of the samples.
This provided a way to test whether the statistical structure of the problem aﬀected
people’s predictions, which would be another aspect of human behavior that would need
to be incorporated into heuristic accounts.
Formally, the treatment of dependency is as follows. The likelihood given in
Equation 10 only applies if the set of n examples are independent. This would be the case
if we were to observe a phenomenon on several diﬀerent occasions, where each occasion
corresponds to a diﬀerent instance of the phenomenon (as in our examples in Experiments
1 and 2, where diﬀerent episodes of baking or diﬀerent trains are observed). If the
observations are completely dependent, as would be the case if they were all observations
of a single instance of the phenomenon, the likelihood is that given in Equation 11 and
new observations less than the maximum value of tpast will have no eﬀect on predictions
about ttotal. An example of this would be standing outside the coﬀee shop and waiting,
noting down the time on the clock every minute. Only the largest observed time should be
used in evaluating how often teacakes are baked, as all of the other observations are
rendered irrelevant by this (if the clock says 54 minutes, it would have said 53 minutes a
minute ago, etc.). If people are using values of tpast to make a statistical inference about
ttotal, we should expect to see an eﬀect of the number of observations when those examples
are independent, but not if they are dependent.
Method
Participants. Participants were 220 undergraduates participating for partial course
credit. Participants were randomly assigned to ﬁve conditions: 42 participants saw only a
single example, while 37 saw three independent examples, 52 saw ten independent

Predicting the future 28
examples, 45 saw three dependent examples, and 44 saw ten independent examples.
Stimuli. Five questionnaires were used, representing two scenarios and three
diﬀerent numbers of examples. The original Teacake scenario was used, together with a
second scenario in which the successive observations of the clock outside the shop were
rendered dependent. This was made apparent through a change in instructions. The
questionnaire for three dependent examples read:
Suppose that one day you decide to wait outside the shop until a fresh batch of
teacakes is baked. You look up several times, and see that the clock reads 8,
then 21, then 34 minutes, all without a new batch of teacakes being made.
Since the dependent times were listed from smallest to largest, the independent times on
the original Teacake scenario were presented in the same order. Each participant saw
either one, three, or ten examples. Since the notion of independence is irrelevant for a
single example, only ﬁve conditions were needed.
Procedure. The procedure was the same as for Experiments 1 and 2.
Results and Discussion
Responses were screened as in Experiment 1. The eﬀect of examples was examined
separately for the independent condition and the dependent condition, since the single
example cell was used in both analyses. A one-way between subjects ANOVA revealed
that varying the number of examples had a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on predictions
when the examples were independent (F(2, 102) = 4.10, MSE = 0.58, p < .05), but not
when they were dependent (F(2, 115) = 0.55, MSE = 1.52, p = 0.58), as predicted by our
Bayesian account. The means for the diﬀerent conditions are displayed in Figure 5.
The results of this experiment suggest that people show a sensitivity to the
statistical properties of the information provided when making judgments about time and

Predicting the future 29
cast doubt on explanations of the results in terms of a simple heuristic like anchoring and
adjustment. First, the between-subjects design meant that people saw only one set of
numbers and were thus not given an opportunity to explicitly anchor a judgment and then
revise it incrementally in the face of further smaller durations. Second, the results provide
no evidence for a tightening of generalization when the observations are dependent. A
sensitivity to dependency needs to be part of an account of predicting the future: If
people are using a simple heuristic to address the task, they are still making an inference
about whether or not the statistical structure of the problem warrants the application of
that heuristic.
Complete dependence between observations is obviously an extreme case, but
provides the strongest manipulation for testing whether people are sensitive to the
statistical structure of their observations. We used this strong manipulation in part
because a similar strategy has been used in exploring children’s sensitivity to the way in
which examples are sampled in word learning (Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007a). However, our
results raise the question of how sensitive people are to this kind of statistical property of
the input – something that can be explored in future work by providing vignettes that
interpolate between complete independence and complete dependence. Understanding
how people reason about dependencies between observations is particularly interesting
given other work showing that people fail to appropriately account for biases in the way
that their observations are sampled (Fiedler & Juslin, 2006; Hertwig, Barron, Weber, &
Erev, 2004; Ross & Nisbett, 1991).
Experiment 4: Predictions from experienced durations
Experiments 1-3 suggest that people’s temporal predictions correspond well to the
qualitative properties of our Bayesian account. However, these experiments all involve
cognitive judgments about time: people receive a set of numbers that correspond to

Predicting the future 30
durations and are asked to produce a response in similar format. Our remaining
experiments examined the eﬀects of multiple observations and prior beliefs in a set of
tasks where both the stimuli and the responses were actual durations. These experiments
involved learning about “Goodman Gems,” named for Goodman (1955). These gems have
the unique property that after a ﬁxed amount of time, they change from one color to
another. Each type of gem has two characteristic colors, spending the same amount of
time displaying one color before switching to the other, and all gems of the same type take
the same amount of time to change. People presumably expect gems not to change in
color, so we used these stimuli as a way to introduce the task in a way where people would
have relatively little prior knowledge about durations. In each experiment the participants
were presented with sets of gems under diﬀerent viewing conditions and asked to judge
how long it takes those gems to change color using a timer. Experiment 4 tested the basic
predictions of our Bayesian model, exploring how people’s judgments vary as the value of
tpast and the number of observations change. This was thus a replication and extension of
Experiment 1 with perceptual rather than conceptual presentation of durations.
Method
Participants. Participants were 27 undergraduates participating for partial course
credit.
Stimuli. The gems were presented as two-dimensional diamonds on a computer
screen, and participants directly observed how long it took them to change color. There
was no need to consider the psychophysical scaling of the stimuli, since the relationship
between actual and perceived time is approximately linear for the intervals used in this
experiment (Allan, 1979).
Procedure. In an initial instruction and practice phase, participants were told about
the properties of Goodman gems and then watched seven gems go through their full color

Predicting the future 31
change cycle, starting in one color, changing to a second, and then changing back to the
ﬁrst. The time taken for these gems to change color was uniformly spaced on a logarithmic
scale, from 0.5 to 32 seconds. Participants saw these gems in random order and then
learned how to click “Start” and “Stop” buttons with the mouse to record how long they
thought the gems took to change color, on average. The initial instructions read:
This is an experiment about a special kind of gemstone, called a Goodman
Gem. Goodman Gems have the unique property of cyclically changing color.
Each gem has two diﬀerent colors. After a ﬁxed amount of time, it will
suddenly change from one color to the other. Some gems change color rapidly,
while others take longer.
In this experiment, you will see Goodman Gems of many diﬀerent kinds. Your
job is to estimate the how much time passes between color changes for each
kind of Goodman Gem.
Every Goodman gem of a particular kind changes color after exactly the same
amount of time. You can tell that two gems are of the same kind because they
have the same colors. This means that you can use your experiences with one
gem of a particular kind to predict how much time should pass between
changing colors for another gem of that kind.
Clicking on the button below with the mouse will show you seven samples of
diﬀerent kinds of Goodman gems changing color, one after the other. Each
gem starts having just changed color, and you will see it change to its other
color and then back again.
Clicking a button then led to the initial examples, and training on the use of the “Start”
and “Stop” buttons, with the following instructions:
Because this experiment involves making judgments about how much time it

Predicting the future 32
takes for a particular kind of Goodman gem to change color, you are going to
use a timer to record your responses.
At several points in the experiment, you will be asked a question about time.
For each question, the procedure will be exactly the same. You will see a
“Start Timer” button, like the one below. When you are ready to record your
response, click on the “Start Timer” button with the mouse.
When you click on the button, it will disappear and you will be told that the
timer is running. A “Stop timer” button will also appear. You should then
wait until the time since you pressed the “Start Timer” button is the same as
the amount of time that corresponds to the answer to the question, then click
on the “Stop Timer” button.
Following this initial phase, participants received further instructions outlining a
story about miners and scientists, intended to establish the nature of the experimental
task:
The seven kinds of Goodman Gems you have seen so far were once thought to
be the only Goodman Gems in existence. However, it has recently been
discovered that a group of miners in a faraway country has found ﬁfteen other
kinds of Goodman Gems, and is trying to sell them to the highest bidder. As a
consequence, the gems will probably be sold to private collectors. You
represent a group of scientists who are interested in knowing how long it takes
these particular Goodman Gems to change color. Unfortunately the miners
realise that once the scientists have this knowledge, they are less likely to try
to buy the gems. Consequently, they won’t let you see any of their new kinds
of gems go through a complete color change cycle. However, since the miners
need to demonstrate that these are actually Goodman Gems, you have the

Predicting the future 33
opportunity to see each of their gems change color once.
There are ﬁfteen new kinds of gems, and the miners are selling ten gems of
each kind. You are only allowed to view one gem at a time.
Each gem is kept in a diﬀerent room, and you enter the room at a random
point in the color change cycle. Once the gem changes color, the miners lead
you back out of the room.
The scientists with whom you are working want you to use the information
you obtain from your observation of the gems to decide how much time it takes
for gems of each kind to change color.
The instructions were discussed with each participant, ensuring that the nature of the
sampling procedure was clear and emphasizing that they would have incomplete
information for making these judgments.
In the main part of the experiment, participants saw ﬁfteen sets of new Goodman
Gems. The sets of gems were chosen in a 5 × 3 factorial array, crossing the maximum time
taken to change color (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 seconds) with the number of examples (1, 3, or 10).
All of the gems of a single kind were seen one after the other, and the participants were
presented with a display showing up to 10 rooms that they could choose to “enter” by
clicking on diﬀerent buttons. An example set of instructions at this point was as follows:
You are about to see a new kind of Goodman gem.
The miners have ten gems of this kind, each housed in a diﬀerent room. On
the next screen, you will see a set of buttons corresponding to the diﬀerent
rooms you can enter. To enter a room, click on the appropriate button. When
you enter a room, you will see the color of the gem and will wait until it
changes color.

Predicting the future 34
All of the Goodman gems you see will be of the same kind, although they will
be at a random point in their color change cycle when you encounter them.
In each set, one gem took the maximum time to change color, while the remaining
durations were random values below this maximum, reﬂecting the fact that the
participant had entered the room at a later point in the gem’s color change cycle. The
gems were shown in random order, so the point at which the gem taking the maximum
time to change color appeared was randomized across sets and subjects. After viewing
each set of gems, participants made a judgment about how long it took that type of gem
to change color, using the “Start” and “Stop” buttons. For these judgments, they were
given the instructions:
Now make a guess about how much time passes before this particular kind of
Goodman gem changes color. Since you haven’t seen any gems change color
and then change back again, you can’t know for certain how much time it
takes. Try to use the information you have obtained so far to make an
informed guess.
Results and Discussion
The design provides the same statistical structure as used in Experiments 1-3,
although the eﬀect of multiple observations is manipulated across sets of gems rather than
within sets of gems. We should thus expect participants to produce smaller predictions for
sets containing more examples. As in the previous experiments, responses shorter than the
longest example indicate a misunderstanding of the requirements of the task. However,
since actual duration estimates tend to be less precise than written responses, we relaxed
our criterion to reject only those participants who produced responses that were less than
half as long as the longest example. This procedure reduced the number of participants
contributing data to 23. We used the same transformation as in the previous experiments

Predicting the future 35
for all analyses, converting responses t to
t
tpast .
The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 6, with the characteristic pattern
of reduced generalization with more examples found in Experiments 1-3. A two-way
within-subjects ANOVA revealed that there was a signiﬁcant eﬀect of number of examples
(F(2, 44) = 35.87, MSE = 0.69, p < .001) and stimulus duration
(F(4, 88) = 43.04, MSE = 0.48, p < .001), and a signiﬁcant interaction between the two
(F(8, 176) = 15.16, MSE = 0.37, p < .001). This pattern of results is consistent with our
Bayesian model, as illustrated by the predictions resulting from using a prior in which β is
chosen so that the peak is at 4 seconds, the geometric mean of the values given as practice
stimuli. These predictions are also shown in Figure 6 (a).
The main eﬀect of number of examples supports our argument, showing the
characteristic pattern predicted by our Bayesian model as a result of the independent
sampling assumption made in the likelihood. The main eﬀect of stimulus duration also
provides strong support for another aspect of our model, reﬂecting the combination of
observed data with a prior distribution. Inspection of Figure 6 (a) shows that this main
eﬀect results from participants producing smaller predictions relative to the maximal
value of tpast for for stimuli of longer duration. That is, people tended to produce
predictions for the total duration that were closer to the maximum observed duration as
the maximum observed duration increased. Such an eﬀect is impossible to explain with
the uninformative prior used by Gott (1994). Under Gott’s analysis, we would expect to
see the same pattern of predictions for all ﬁve durations. The smaller predictions with
longer durations indicate that people have expectations about how long our gems should
take to change color. When the observed durations are shorter than expected, they make
a larger prediction. As the observed durations increase, the extent to which they are
willing to go beyond the maximum observed value decreases. The ability of our model to
capture this pattern with a single choice of β equal to the geometric mean of the practice

Predicting the future 36
data suggests that people have estimated the typical time scale for this scenario and use
that as an ingredient in a rational statistical prediction of duration.
Experiment 5: Irrelevance of order
Experiment 4 showed that the magnitude of people’s predictions relative to the
maximum value of tpast decreases as a function of the number of examples, consistent with
the predictions of our Bayesian model. An alternative explanation for these results could
be formed based upon the fact that as the number of examples increases, so does the
elapsed time between observing the maximum value of tpast and making a prediction.
With one observation, the maximum value has to be the last thing the participant saw.
With three observations, there will typically be one other observation between the
maximum value and the time when participants make a judgment. With ten observations,
there will typically be four or ﬁve observations between the maximum value and the time
when participants make a judgment. This increase in elapsed time could account for our
results if people forget earlier observations, or if people put greater weight on more recent
trials (a recency eﬀect).
To address this alternative explanation, we replicated Experiment 4 but ﬁxed the
order of examples so that the largest value of tpast always appeared last. Our Bayesian
model is insensitive to the order of the observations and thus the basic pattern of results
should be similar to those of Experiment 4. Recent work has pointed out that order
eﬀects pose a challenge for Bayesian models that assume observations are independent and
identically distributed (e.g., Kruschke, 2006). Our goal here is not to exhaustively rule out
order eﬀects in the predicting the future task, but to examine whether this speciﬁc aspect
of order – the location of the maximal observation – could account for our ﬁndings in
Experiment 4. If the distance between this maximum value and the prediction is
responsible for the observed eﬀect, then the eﬀect should be removed by adopting this

Predicting the future 37
presentation order. If people are instead sensitive just to the statistical structure of the
task, we would expect to see an eﬀect of multiple observations despite the maximum value
of tpast appearing last.
Method
Participants. Participants were 21 undergraduates participating for course credit.
Stimuli. Stimuli were the same as for Experiment 4.
Procedure. Procedure was the same as for Experiment 4, except the largest value of
tpast was always the last to be presented.
Results and Discussion
Two participants produced values of t less than half as long as tpast and were
excluded from the analysis. The same transformation as in Experiment 4 was used for all
analyses. The results are shown in Figure 6 (b). The results reproduced the pattern seen
in Experiment 4, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of number of examples
(F(2, 38) = 31.50, MSE = 0.27, p < .001) and stimulus duration
(F(4, 76) = 20.94, MSE = 0.69, p < .001), and a signiﬁcant interaction between the two
(F(8, 152) = 5.71, MSE = 0.24, p < .001). Again, the results were consistent with our
Bayesian account, as can be seen from the predictions of the model with the same value of
β as in Experiment 4, also shown in Figure 6 (b).
Our results indicate that forgetting previous observations or placing greater weight
on more recent observations cannot account for the decrease in the magnitude of people’s
predictions relative to the maximal value of tpast as they obtain more observations. Even
when the maximal value was the most recent, we saw a decrease in predictions consistent
with our Bayesian model. However, this experiment examined only one manipulation of
the order of observations and do not rule out the possibility of order eﬀects in this task.

Predicting the future 38
Since our Bayesian model predicts that the order of observations should be irrelevant to
people’s predictions, a more comprehensive investigation of order eﬀects would provide a
strong test of the model.
Taken together, these two experiments suggests that the eﬀect of multiple examples
observed in Experiments 1-3 extends beyond cognitive stimuli dealing with time, aﬀecting
explicitly temporal judgments in which both stimuli and responses are actual durations.
The results also illustrate that the eﬀect of multiple observations can be obtained in
situations where judgments are not a direct result of the revision of beliefs in the face of
new information. Since the experiment used diﬀerent stimuli for sets of diﬀerent sizes, the
resulting judgments did not reﬂect the gradual accumulation of information about a single
temporal quantity, but several decisions about diﬀerent quantities. People showed the
predicted eﬀect of multiple observations in making these decisions. This outcome is
similar to that obtained in Experiment 3, but extends the result to perceptual stimuli and
a situation in which a single individual makes multiple judgments.
General Discussion
Predicting the future is a diﬃcult inductive problem, but one that people often solve
eﬀortlessly. Our results suggest that people’s predictions about temporal events are
consistent with a rational statistical account of predicting the future, which uses Bayesian
inference to combine prior knowledge of durations with information from multiple
examples. Experiment 1 showed that the eﬀect of providing further examples conformed
to the predictions of our Bayesian model: more examples promoted a reduction in the
scope of generalization, with predictions becoming closer to the largest example provided.
Experiment 2 showed that people’s predictions could be aﬀected by the manipulation of
their prior expectations and that this eﬀect was consistent with the interaction of priors
and likelihoods in Bayesian inference. Experiment 3 showed that the revision of beliefs as

Predicting the future 39
a result of further information was appropriately sensitive to the dependency structure of
the observations. Finally, Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that the eﬀect of multiple
observations extended to explicitly temporal judgments with perceptual stimuli and
situations in which judgments did not require the direct revision of beliefs.
These results provide constraints on possible algorithms that people could be using
to predict future events. People’s predictions are inconsistent with existing simple
heuristics, such as the multiplicative rule proposed by Gott (1993) and the Mink heuristic
proposed by Mozer et al. (2008). In particular, neither of these heuristics provides an
account of how multiple observations should inﬂuence predictions, making it diﬃcult to
explain the results of Experiments 1, 4, and 5. The sensitivity to instructional
manipulation of priors in Experiment 2 and statistical dependency structure observed in
Experiment 3 also suggests that people are doing something more sophisticated than
naively applying a simple heuristic, since they seem to take into account prior knowledge
of durations in a form other than samples from the distribution and the sampling process
by which the observations were generated. This kind of sensitivity is consistent with
treating the problem of forming predictions as one of statistical inference.
In the remainder of the paper, we will explore in detail several issues that are raised
by our results. First, we will discuss how accounts of predicting the future at diﬀerent
levels of analysis can be mutually informative. Our analysis is at Marr’s (1982)
computational level, deﬁning the the computational problem presented by predicting the
future and considering how it might be solved. Characteristically for this kind of analysis,
we have been concerned with why people make the judgments they do, rather than how
they make those judgments. Further insights into the algorithms behind everyday
predicting the future can be gained from a study by Sternberg and Kalmar (1998), and
our computational account suggests some simple heuristics in addition to those considered
so far that may guide people’s predictions. Having discussed these issues, we will brieﬂy

Predicting the future 40
consider how predicting the future relates to other cognitive problems.
Levels of analysis
In presenting a Bayesian account of predicting the future, we are not claiming that
people explicitly perform Bayesian calculations whenever they pass a coﬀee shop or arrive
at a train station. Rather, we are claiming that a probabilistic analysis of the problem of
predicting the future can provide us with insight into the human ability to solve inductive
problems. This account is complementary to analyses of the cognitive processes involved
in forming predictions (e.g., Sternberg & Kalmar, 1998) and can be conducted in parallel
with investigations of whether people’s judgments can be explained in terms of simple
heuristics.
Computation and algorithm. Marr (1982) identiﬁed three levels at which theories of
cognition can provide explanations: computational, algorithmic, and implementational.
Our analysis of the problem of predicting the future aims to provide an explanation at the
computational level, addressing the question “What is the goal of the computation, why is
it appropriate, and what is the logic of the strategy by which it can be carried out?”
(Marr, 1982, p. 25). We have made no commitments to the algorithms by which people
solve this computational problem, or how they might be implemented. Theories at these
diﬀerent levels have the potential to provide complementary insights into people’s ability
to predict the future. While neuroscientists have begun to investigate the neural basis of
prediction (Huettel, Mack, & McCarthy, 2002) and the perception of time (Eagleman &
Holcombe, 2002), we still lack a clear account of how the ability to predict the future
might be implemented in our brains. However, a detailed algorithmic level analysis of
everyday induction was conducted by Sternberg and Kalmar (1998), providing some
results that parallel our ﬁndings.
Sternberg and Kalmar (1998) had participants make a series of judgments about

Predicting the future 41
events either in the future or the past (they termed these tasks “prediction” and
“postdiction” respectively) and then used psychometric techniques to establish which
properties of the stimuli aﬀected the time taken to form these judgments. Their results
were interpreted in terms of a 17-step information-processing model, where each step
identiﬁed a computational operation involved in encoding the stimuli, accessing memory,
forming a prediction, and making a response. The variables found to aﬀect response time
included the amount of time between the present and the past or future date, whether the
judgment was prediction or postdiction, and how much additional information might be
needed to make a prediction. On the basis of these results, Sternberg and Kalmar
concluded that the key steps in the algorithm were those that involved computing the
diﬀerence between the current and the past or future time and developing a schema
describing the event.
Sternberg and Kalmar’s (1998) results suggest that the strategies people use to
make predictions about the past and the future are highly similar, with overlapping (but
non-identical) factors inﬂuencing response latencies in prediction and postdiction. This
provides a nice algorithmic analogue to our analysis, in which values of tpast and tfuture are
equally informative about ttotal (as discussed brieﬂy in Experiment 1). Their ﬁndings also
illustrate the important role that prior knowledge plays in everyday inductive inferences.
While our analysis assumes a simple prior, in which domain knowledge is reﬂected only in
the choice of β, the retrieval and processing of information relevant to a problem will be
an important step in being able to reach solutions that reﬂect both appropriate knowledge
about the domain and the eﬀect of the observations.
Statistics and heuristics. The consistency of human behavior with our Bayesian
model suggests that our intuitions about predicting the future can be understood in terms
of rational statistical inference, but does not imply that we work through Bayes’ rule
whenever we need to make predictions. Presumably, people are following some cognitive

Predicting the future 42
algorithm when solving this problem. An analysis of a problem at the computational level
can provide informative constraints on possible algorithmic-level theories. In this case,
behavior consistent with our Bayesian model provides constraints on the heuristics that
people might be using in solving the problem of predicting the future. The standard use of
heuristics in psychological theory is as a direct alternative to applying any form of
Bayesian reasoning to a problem. In contrast, we view heuristics as providing simple
means of achieving solutions similar to the Bayesian solution, without the computational
overhead. A probabilistic analysis of a cognitive problem is complementary to identifying
a heuristic that seems consistent with human behavior: the probabilistic analysis can
explain why a particular heuristic is useful, while the heuristic answers the question of
how people are able to perform a task.
Our experiments illustrate that people seem to combine observations with prior
knowledge in a way that is consistent with Bayesian inference and can take into account
information from multiple observations. A heuristic account needs to be able to
accommodate both of these ﬁndings. The Mink heuristic introduced by Mozer et
al. (2008) illustrates how the eﬀects of prior knowledge on predictions could be
implemented without requiring sophisticated probabilistic computations. Mozer et
al. used this heuristic to show that results consistent with our Bayesian analysis could be
produced by aggregating across a population in which each participant has access to only
k samples from the prior. Subsequent work using a within-subjects version of the
predicting the future task provides evidence against this account (Lewandowsky et al.,
2009). However, sampling from the prior still provides a good way to approximate
Bayesian inference and is consistent with performance on this task if participants draw a
new set of k samples from the prior each time they have to make an inference (Shi et al.,
in press). Indeed, approximations based on a small number of samples can represent an
optimal trade-oﬀbetween accuracy and computation time (Vul et al., 2009).

Predicting the future 43
The Mink heuristic, in its current form, is not capable of accounting for how people
incorporate information from multiple observations (as illustrated in Experiments 1, 4,
and 5), how they adjust their priors based on verbal instructions (as illustrated in
Experiment 2), or why they are sensitive to the statistical dependency structure of their
observations (as illustrated in Experiment 3). Each of these results thus poses a challenge
to this account. However, this does not mean that it will not be possible to construct a
heuristic that satisﬁes these constraints. For the purpose of illustration, we will show how
simple heuristics might be able to account for the eﬀect of multiple observations.
We will consider two variants on a simple heuristic, making use of the intuition that
as the density of observations in an interval increases, the range of generalization should
decrease. The simplest form of this “density” heuristic is the rule “The distance to
extrapolate is the range of scores divided by the number of examples”. Using this
heuristic, the predicted value of ttotal is
t = tpast + tpast
n .
(12)
This heuristic derives its pedigree from frequentist statistics, where statistical problems
equivalent to our problem of predicting the future are addressed by using t as an unbiased
estimator of ttotal. This simple density heuristic is insensitive to scale and thus cannot
account for the variation in judgments seen in Experiments 1 and 2. In fact, it is closely
related to our Bayesian model with the scale free prior: a ﬁrst order Taylor series
expansion of P(ttotal > t|T) around the maximum value of tpast gives the prediction
t = tpast + tpast
2n . Using this heuristic might thus make sense if one has very little knowledge
about the domain, but will be inappropriate if one has a sense of the scale of predictions.
In order to accommodate the results of our experiments, a heuristic needs to reﬂect
the natural scale of durations in a particular domain. Observing that the Erlang prior

Predicting the future 44
results in the prediction t = tpast + β log 2 with a single observation, we might deﬁne a
density heuristic for a domain with a natural scale to be
t = tpast + β
n.
(13)
Here, the density of the observations is evaluated not with respect to tpast, but with
respect to the assumed scale of the problem. This heuristic gives a reasonably good
account of our data from Experiments 4 and 5 with β = 2.7s, as can be seen in Figure 7.
The full Bayesian model with an Erlang prior gives correlations of r = 0.933 and r = 0.920
for Experiments 4 and 5 respectively, while this density heuristic gives r = 0.906 and
r = 0.895. Just as the Erlang prior is not suitable for all circumstances (such as predicting
human lifespans and the grosses of movies, as discussed above and in Griﬃths &
Tenenbaum, 2006), this particular heuristic might be expected to have limited application.
However, heuristics based on density should be able to capture one of the central results of
our Bayesian analysis and our experiments – the decrease in the extent of generalization
as a function of the number of examples.
Taken together, using samples from the prior and paying attention to the density of
observations might provide a way to approximate our Bayesian model. However, adopting
the appropriate heuristic for producing such an approximation might be a challenging task
in itself. While assessing the density of a set of observations does not require any
statistical sophistication, people still need to be suﬃciently aware of the statistical
structure of a problem to know that applying a particular heuristic is justiﬁed: the results
of Experiment 3 indicate that if a set of observations has the wrong dependency structure,
people do not apply this kind of heuristic. Judging whether or not a simple heuristic is
applicable can require a complex inference that relies upon subtle details of a problem and
is a current topic of investigation in research on heuristics (Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009).

Predicting the future 45
Predicting the future and other cognitive problems
We have considered predicting the future to be a desirable goal in itself, but being
able to form such judgments also has important implications for other areas of cognition.
In this section, we consider how our analysis relates to work on memory and
generalization.
Memory and the future. Our analysis of predicting the future is based upon the
problem of predicting the duration of events, but a similar statistical analysis can be
provided for other kinds of prediction tasks. In any such task, the key to making
predictions will be specifying a statistical model that captures the quantities to be
predicted and the relationship between past and future observations. Anderson (1990)
argued that a number of phenomena in human memory can be understood by considering
the goal of memory to be the eﬃcient storage of facts that are likely to be needed in the
future. Anderson’s analysis of this problem views the memory system as assuming a
simple statistical model of when facts are needed, essentially a non-homogeneous Poisson
process, and estimating the properties of each fact according to this model. While the
speciﬁcs of his account diﬀer from ours, the two approaches embody a similar philosophy
in providing a computational level analysis of the problem of predicting the future.
Anderson (1990) suggests that these inferences occur unconsciously and are an important
part of the human memory. One attractive component of future research is thus exploring
the extent to which unconscious temporal judgments more broadly reﬂect simple
statistical principles.
Predicting the future as generalization through time. Our Bayesian approach to
predicting the future is closely related to Shepard’s (1987) analysis of the problem of
generalization. Given two objects x and y, represented as points in a psychological space,
and the knowledge that x has a particular property (equivalent to belonging to a

Predicting the future 46
“consequential region” in psychological space C, containing all objects with that
property), the problem of generalization involves computing the probability that y also
has that property, P(y ∈C|x). Shepard (1987) used a simple Bayesian argument to show
that this probability decreases as an exponential function of the distance between x and y.
Tenenbaum and Griﬃths (2001) extended Shepard’s (1987) analysis of the problem
of generalization to cover diﬀerent kinds of consequential regions and to allow for
situations in which not just a single object x but a set of objects X were oﬀered as
examples drawn from C. The generalization function P(y ∈C|X) can be evaluated via
Bayesian inference, computing
P(y ∈C|X) =
R
h∈H,h∋X,y P(X|h)P(h)
R
h∈H,h∋X P(X|h)P(h) ,
(14)
where h is a hypothetical consequential region, H is the set of all such hypotheses, P(X|h)
is the probability of the set of objects X being sampled from the consequential region h,
and P(h) is a prior on consequential regions. Tenenbaum and Griﬃths (2001) deﬁned the
likelihood P(X|h) to be
P(X|h) =








1
|h|
n
X ∈h
0
otherwise
(15)
where |h| is the size of h, being the number of objects in a discrete set or the measure of a
continuous hypothesis, and n is the number of objects in X. The likelihood reﬂects the
assumption that the objects were independently sampled uniformly at random from h and
implies that smaller, more speciﬁc hypotheses will receive higher probabilities than larger,
more general hypotheses, even when both are equally consistent with the set of
observations. Tenenbaum and Griﬃths (2001; Tenenbaum, 1999) called this as the “size
principle”.
The method for predicting the future outlined above can be expressed in terms of

Predicting the future 47
Equation 14. H is the set of all possible durations of a phenomenon, with each h an
interval [0, ttotal] for ttotal ∈[0, ∞). Instead of X we observe T, a set of n observations
with maximum value tpast, and it is easily seen that Equation 15 becomes Equation 10:
the Copernican anthropic principle is equivalent to the size principle. Instead of y we have
a new time t and thus Equation 14 becomes
P(ttotal > t|T) =
R ∞
t
P(T|ttotal)P(ttotal) dttotal
R ∞
tpast P(T|ttotal)P(ttotal) dttotal
,
which is exactly the same computation as Equation 6.
The problem of predicting the duration of a phenomenon is equivalent to Shepard’s
(1987) problem of generalization. While Shepard’s original formulation involved
generalization through psychological space, predicting the future involves generalization
through time. We should thus expect to ﬁnd similar principles guiding people’s
generalizations regardless of whether they involve time or some other quantity, as long as
they embody the same statistical structure. As mentioned earlier in the paper, one
problem that has the same structure as predicting the future is predicting healthy levels of
imaginary toxins: given a number that is a healthy level of a particular toxin, guessing the
highest level of the toxin that would be considered healthy. This situation is exactly
analogous to predicting the total duration of an event from the amount of elapsed time
since the start of the event. In both cases one is given a number that is assumed to be
randomly sampled from the set of all numbers satisfying a particular criterion, and one is
asked to judge the nature of this criterion. Since both duration and toxin levels are
numbers required to be between 0 and some maximum number, this judgement requires
the estimation of the maximum number (ttotal in the case of predicting the future). The
results of Experiment 1, in which judgments for healthy levels of toxins were similar to
predictions of ttotal, provides support for the idea that predicting the future may simply

Predicting the future 48
be an aspect of the human ability to form meaningful generalizations.
Other problems of estimation and prediction. Our analysis of predicting the future
involves a very speciﬁc situation, in which people need to form an estimate of the total
extent or duration of a phenomenon and that quantity is constant across multiple
observations. This limits the range of problems to which the simple solution to this
problem that we present here should be applied. One restrictive assumption is that there
is no variability in the total extent or duration across instances of a phenomenon. For
example, in our teacake scenario the coﬀee shop baked to a ﬁxed but unknown schedule.
However, most coﬀee shops probably bake on a variable schedule throughout the day,
meaning that ttotal is not a single ﬁxed value, but something that varies from batch to
batch. This can be incorporated into our Bayesian model by making our hypotheses
represent diﬀerent forms for the distribution of ttotal, rather than a single value, but this
adds a signiﬁcant amount of complexity.
This example should make it clear that our Bayesian model does not provide a
general solution to problems of estimation and prediction. The Bayesian framework, in
which prior knowledge is combined with the information provided by a set of observations,
can be used to solve these problems in general, but the nature of the hypotheses under
consideration will vary from task to task. The analysis given in the previous section should
make it clear that another Bayesian model – Shepard’s (1987) account of generalization –
corresponds to assuming a slightly more general class of hypotheses. Bayesian models used
in other domains, such as models of category learning (e.g., Anderson, 1991), provide
strategies for estimating probability distributions over observations, taking diﬀerent forms
for those distributions as the hypotheses that they evaluate. Forming good predictions
requires using a set of hypotheses that matches the structure of the problem to be solved,
as well as prior knowledge appropriate to that domain.

Predicting the future 49
Conclusion
The ability to eﬀortlessly solve inductive problems is one of the most compelling
aspects of human cognition. Bayesian inference provides a natural framework for studying
everyday induction, being a formal method for combining rational statistical inferences
from observations with rich prior knowledge. These two components are central to
understanding how it is that people can solve diﬃcult inductive problems. In this paper,
we have shown how the problem of predicting the future can be addressed within this
framework and examined how well a Bayesian model of predicting the future accounts for
people’s judgments. The results of our experiments indicate that people behave in a way
that is consistent with our Bayesian model, incorporating information from multiple
observations, using prior knowledge, and being sensitive to the statistical structure of the
observed data. These results provide constraints on algorithms that might explain how
people are able to solve the challenging problem of predicting the future.

Notes
1A more standard use of the anthropic principle in cosmology is as a way to explain
otherwise improbable events, such as cosmological constants taking values that support a
stable universe or the emergence of intelligent life. If we condition on there being an
intelligent observer to observe such events, their probability is 1. A detailed discussion of
uses of the anthropic principle is given in Bostrom (2002).
2It should be noted that this is an “improper” prior, since it does not integrate to 1
over all values of ttotal from 0 to ∞. Such priors can be used in Bayesian inference in cases
where the resulting posterior distribution still integrates to 1, as it does in this case. For
details, see Jaynes (2003) or Bernardo and Smith (1994).

runtimes of movies (in minutes), the box oﬃce gross of movies (in millions of United
States dollars), the length of poems (in lines), and the time served by members of the
United States House of Representatives (in years). The histograms show the actual
distributions, and the red curves show approximations from Gaussian (life spans and
movie runtimes), power-law (movie grosses and length of poems), and Erlang (time in the
House of Representatives) distributions. The lower panels show optimal Bayesian
predictions for these quantities, corresponding to the posterior median of ttotal given tpast
(see text for details). Black lines use the histogram as a prior, grey lines use the
approximating distributions. The dotted line shows Gott’s rule, with ttotal estimated as
twice tpast, which seems appropriate in some cases (such as movie grosses) but not in
others (such as life spans). The black dots indicate the median of human predictions for
these quantities, with error bars corresponding to a 68% conﬁdence interval estimated by
bootstrap (see Griﬃths & Tenenbaum, 2006, for details).
Figure 2. Predictions of the various models, depicting the posterior median (the point t at
which P(ttotal < t|T) = 0.5) for a set T containing 1, 3 and 10 observations. The
predictions of each model are shown as a line connecting three points: the left point is the
prediction for a single example, the center point shows the prediction for three
observations and the right point is the prediction for ten observations. On all graphs, the
vertical axis shows the predicted value of t in proportion to tpast, the largest value in the
set of observations T. (a) The predictions produced by the simple delta t argument. (b)
The predictions of a Bayesian model with uninformative prior but a likelihood that
accommodates multiple observations. (c) The predictions of a Bayesian model with an

Erlang prior of β = 4 given sets of observations varying in the maximum value of tpast.
Figure 3. Results of Experiment 1. The mean responses for each condition are displayed
in the same format as Figure 2, with 1, 3, and 10 examples corresponding to the left,
center, and right points on each plotted line. Error bars show one standard error. All four
conditions show a clear eﬀect of number of examples, irrespective of whether they are
judgments involving time, as well as variation in the overall range of generalization
corresponding to diﬀerences in priors.
Figure 4. Results of Experiment 2. The mean responses for each condition are displayed
in the same format as Figure 3, with 1, 3, and 10 examples corresponding to the left,
center, and right points on each plotted line. Error bars show one standard error. The
results are consistent with the manipulation of the priors described in the text.
Figure 5. Results of Experiment 3. The mean responses for each condition are displayed
in the same format as Figure 3, with 1, 3, and 10 examples corresponding to the left,
center, and right points on each plotted line. Error bars show one standard error. An
eﬀect of multiple observations is only observed when the examples are independent.
Figure 6. Results of Experiment 4 (upper panel) and Experiment 5 (lower panel). The
mean responses for each condition are displayed in the same format as Figure 3, with 1, 3,
and 10 examples corresponding to the left, center, and right points on each plotted line.
Error bars show one standard error. The eﬀect of multiple observations persists with
perceptual stimuli and the variation in the size of predictions can be accounted for by
assuming a single prior distribution over total duration.
Figure 7. As in Figure 6, (a) shows the results of Experiment 4 and (b) shows the results
of Experiment 5. The dotted lines indicate the predictions of a version of the density
