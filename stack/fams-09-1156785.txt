Surrogate models are a must-have in a scenario-based safety simulation
framework to design optimally integrated safety systems for new mobility
solutions. The objective of this study is the development of surrogate models
for active human model responses under consideration of multiple sampling
strategies. A Gaussian process regression is chosen for predicting injury values
based on the collision scenario, the occupant’s seating position after a pre-crash
movement and selected restraint system parameters. The trained models are
validated and assessed for each sampling method and the best-performing
surrogate model is selected for restraint system parameter optimization.

1. Introduction
With the invention of the automobile in 1889, Carl Benz ushered in a new age of mobility.
Since then, vehicle and occupant safety has played an important role, resulting in various
vehicle safety concepts, laws and regulations, each of which has reduced traﬃc accidents
and fatalities, and today enables the concept Vision Zero [1] with no fatalities on the road.
Nowadays it is much safer to enter a vehicle than it was 30 years ago (see Figure 1). Passive
Safety devices like the belt or airbags decreased the fatalities on the road. Active vehicle safety
functions include, for example, an adaptive cruise control (ACC) [3], a forward collision
warning (FCW) and an autonomous emergency braking (AEB) [4]. In contrast to passive
safety systems, active vehicle safety functions primarily act in the so-called pre-crash phase
and aim to prevent collisions or mitigate collision consequences by reducing the impact
speed, for example. Those systems act prior to an impact and therefore have much more
possibilities to inﬂuence the crash outcome.
Integrated vehicle safety systems that combine active and passive safety components,
called integrated vehicle safety–hold great promise for reducing the number and severity
of traﬃc accidents [5]. Therefore, integrated safety is investigated in detail in various
international research projects, e.g. the OSCCAR [6] and VIRTUAL [7] project. As speciﬁed
in the Euro NCAP roadmap, future vehicle safety systems need to fulﬁll new requirements
and perform robust in existing and future real-world driving scenarios. As a result, virtual

and simulative test methods [8] will become increasingly important
in the future, as they oﬀer a more eﬃcient and cost-eﬀective
way to evaluate and optimize the performance of these systems.
Often such an approach is called a holistic scenario-based analysis
and safety performance assessment of novel integrated safety
system solutions.
The diﬀerences in initial posture in the pre-crash phase can
have an inﬂuence on the risk of injury during the in-crash phase [9].
Therefore, the pre-crash phase is so important, to consider for the
design of holistic safety systems. A braking or steering maneuver
may cause the occupant to experience lateral or longitudinal
shifts and may not be seated in the default position when the
collision occurs.
The proposed simulation framework (see Figure 2B) is an
attempt to combine all relevant simulation steps from normal
driving to safety-critical events (see Figures 2A, B) and [10].
The simulations should help accelerate and digitize the currently
separated areas of active and passive vehicle safety system by
using one common framework. The framework consists of three
simulation entities.
The scenario simulation in Carmaker (Figure 2Ba) includes
two vehicles, equipped with active safety systems, and provides
the vehicle trajectory in the pre-crash phase as well as the
resulting collision conﬁguration. Subsequently, a FEM vehicle crash
simulation in LS-Dyna (Figure 2Bb) is performed to calculate the
crash pulse of the interior survival space. Finally, the acceleration
signals from the pre- and in-crash phase are transferred to a
Madymo vehicle interior model, including an active human model
(AHM), which is positioned on the driver seat (Figure 2Bc) and for
a chosen set of restraint system parameters the HIC36 and chest
deﬂection are computed.
The computational cost of simulating passenger movement and
injury prediction values using FEM and MBS simulations can be
very high. For example, the passenger movement simulation can
take up to 3 h to simulate only 3 s of real-world time, and a single
crash simulation can take up to 20 h on 10 CPUs to simulate
only 180 ms of real-world time. Due to the enormous diversity
in collision conﬁgurations and occupant behavior in real-world
accidents, the number of considered scenarios and thus, the eﬀort
in simulation signiﬁcantly increases, e.g., 300 scenarios with 3 active
safety system variants result in 900 FEM and MBS simulations1
900∗20h ≈2y CPU time. These time requirements can make it
challenging to perform scenario-based assessments of integrated
vehicle safety systems with conventional simulation mehods, as
many simulations may be required to cover diﬀerent scenarios and
system conﬁgurations.
Since many of the simulation codes used in vehicle safety are
proprietary and closed-source. Non-intrusive, data-based surrogate
models are often the only possible choice. The ﬁnal framework in
Figure 3 used for an eﬃcient approximation of the human body
model response is then obtained by exchanging the FEM and MBS
simulations for a suitable data-based surrogate model.
As shown in [11] the crash pulse of the FEM model of the crash
can be predicted in a cost- and time-eﬃcient manner by Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR).
The paper has three primary foci:
1. The evaluation of the suitability of surrogate models for
the prediction of the human body model response, i.e., the
MBS simulation;
2. The tradeoﬀbetween the number of samples in the training and
the accuracy of the data-driven surrogate models.

parameters of the restraint system are simulated to calculate the injury severity. (B) Detailed description of the data-ﬂow in the simulation framework

3. Can the developed surrogate models be applied for an
eﬃcient optimization of the restraint system parameters for a
given scenario?
Other published studies on surrogate model development for
human body model [12] response prediction in crash situations
performed a variation of the restraint system parameter to predict
the Life Years Lost [13] or varied the crash pulse and safety system
usage [14]. In Berthelson et al. [15] a surrogate model selection
algorithm was applied for HIC36 prediction based on the collision
conﬁguration and found the GPR as best-suited surrogate model.
Similar to [11] a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is
used to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs. The concrete
data set D : X →y of the learning problem consists of the input
values X
∈R9, which are the initial head position dPC

the collision conﬁguration pCollision ∈R3, and selected restraint
system parameters pRestraint ∈R4, and the output values y =

deﬂection (CD).
Typically, the accuracy of data-driven surrogate models
increases with the number of samples. As vehicle safety simulations

are rather expensive and time consuming, there exists a tradeoﬀ
between the size of the generated training set and the surrogate
models’ accuracy. The design of experiments addresses that conﬂict
and provides multiple sampling methods that aim to cover the
entire parameter space while maximizing the information gain. In
this study, three sampling methods–a d-optimal design, a space-
ﬁlling design and an adaptive sampling scheme—are compared
and assessed regarding their suitability for surrogate model
development for occupant safety.
In addition to a variation of restraint system parameter and
the collision conﬁguration, this study includes a variation of the
occupant’s posture resulting from the pre-crash scenario, which is
in the simplest case represented by the head position dPC
head ∈R2.
The paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 explains the
methods for the simulation framework, the considered sampling
and training methods for data-based surrogate modeling, and
the restraint system optimization process. Results with respect to
surrogate model performance and restraint system optimization are
presented in Section 3. The paper concludes with a discussion in
Section 4.
2. Methods
The surrogate modeling process can be divided into three
steps, training data generation, model training and validation.
Since conventional vehicle safety system simulations, such as FEM
and MBS, are computationally expensive, the training set should
be as small as possible while ensuring broad coverage of the
entire parameter space. In order to address this tradeoﬀ, diﬀerent
sampling methods for selecting the training data are applied.
Subsequently, the surrogate model is trained and validated with
the generated data. Finally, the resulting models are compared with
respect to performance on previously unseen data.
2.1. Simulation framework for training data
generation
The training data generation process involves multiple
simulation steps that are illustrated in Figure 1. The simulation
framework consists of a scenario simulation, a vehicle crash
simulation, and an occupant restraint system simulation that
includes both the pre- and in-crash phase. A more in-depth
explanation of the simulation framework is given in Wimmer et al.
[10] and Hay [16].
The generation process of synthetic driving and collision
scenarios (Figure 2Ba) involves two conﬂict partners, sampling
of diﬀerent parameter distributions (e.g. velocity, acceleration,
steering angle), which are constrained to physical limits, and
includes a CarMaker vehicle dynamics model. The generated
scenarios are then ﬁltered so that only the remaining 285 driving
scenarios resulting in the conﬁguration in Figure 4 are considered
as baseline for the restraint system parameter optimization.
The
scenario
simulation
(Figure 2Ba)
provides
vehicle
trajectories with corresponding accelerations av
∈[0, t0], that
are transferred to the occupant restraint system simulation. In
addition, the last time step of the scenario simulation describes
the collision conﬁguration in dependence of the initial velocity,
the angle and oﬀset of the target and ego vehicle. The parameters
describing the collision conﬁguration were chosen such that the
results are bound by a subset of all possible conﬁgurations in the
scenario simulation results, which are limited to the indicated
conﬁguration ranges in Figure 4. The impact angle is chosen within
the range of common frontal barrier crash tests.
The collision conﬁguration deﬁnes the initial condition of
the vehicle to vehicle crash simulation (Figure 2Bb), which is
performed in LS-Dyna (Version 9.2) with two Honda Accord
models [17]. In order to reduce the complexity in this initial
proof of concept only one vehicle type without a variation of
the mass is considered. A vehicle crash FEM simulation however
requires large computational eﬀorts and results in simulation times
of more than 20 h. To be able to consider a broad variation
of loading conditions in very short time frames, the surrogate
model developed in [11] was used to approximate the crash
pulse in an eﬃcient way. The predicted crash pulses ap

and applied to a Madymo occupant restraint system simulation
model (Figure 2Bc). The Madymo model consists of a vehicle
interior, deﬁned by multi-bodies and an FE instrument panel.
The Madymo AHM (Version 3.1) is positioned on the driver
seat and a FE three-point-belt with bar elements between d-ring

and buckle is attached, see Figure 5. Furthermore, a generic
and scalable driver airbag with a volume of approximately 40 l
is installed.
The model allows a modiﬁcation of restraint system parameters
pRestraint, such as the airbag time to ﬁre ABTFF, the airbag
vent diameter dVent, the retractor pretensioner load limiter
PTU and the retractor pretensioner time to ﬁre PTTTF. The
occupant restraint system simulation is performed with Madymo
Version 7.8.
During the simulation, the relative head displacement dPC
head =
{headx, heady} is measured, see Figure 6, and used as representation
of the occupant’s seating position resulting from the pre-crash
scenario. The head position is chosen since a displacement of
the head is likely to result in a variation of the point of
impact on the airbag and potentially in a higher probability of
sliding alongside the airbag, contact with the vehicle interior and
increased injury probability. However, the occupant motion and
head trajectory depend on the pre-crash acceleration av. Since
the generation of acceleration signals that result in speciﬁc head
positions is nontrivial, the available pre-crash acceleration signals
were analyzed and nine grid-like samples that cover the range of
motion were selected for training data generation (see Figure 6).
The selected pre-crash scenarios include maximum longitudinal
decelerations of 8.5
m
s2 and maximum lateral accelerations of
4.5
m
s2
and are therefore presumed to enclose the relevant
parameter space. The surrogate model is then assumed to learn
the correlation between the training samples for all head positions
in the deﬁned range in order to predict the respective AHM
response. Although the Madymo simulation provides multiple
injury criteria, this study only focuses on the HIC36 and
chest deﬂection.
For each sampling method Madymo simulations are performed
based on the nine selected pre-crash accelerations and crash pulses
resulting from collision conﬁgurations in the range of Figure 4.
In addition, a variation of the restraint system parameters is
performed. The retractor pretensioner load limiter, the airbag vent
diameter and the airbag and retractor pretensioner time to ﬁre
(ttf) are each varied around a standard setup without considering
the current technical limitations to a full extent. The training
data set then consists of a combination of the input parameter in
Table 1 and the corresponding HIC36 and chest deﬂection values
for each simulation.
The prediction framework, including the trained surrogate
model is illustrated in Figure 3. For each scenario, a simulation
of the occupant movement in the pre-crash phase is required
to determine the head position at the time of collision. A
computational eﬃcient approximation of the occupant movement
is achieved by usage of a simpliﬁed physics-based occupant model
that is similar to the one described in Cyrén and Johansson [18].
The surrogate model will then predict y = {HIC36, CD} ∈R2,
i.e., the head injury criterion (HIC36) and chest deﬂection (CD)
for given X, i.e., the initial head position dPC
head, the collision
conﬁguration pCollision, and a chosen set of restraint system
parameters pRestraint. In vehicle safety simulations, injury values can
vary greatly, with very high injury values resulting, for example,
from low airbag pressure or a displaced impact position and
thus contact with the steering wheel or vehicle interior. Since
state-of-the-art restraint systems are only designed and optimized

for standard load-cases, discontinuities and high injury values,
especially in the marginal area, may therefore occur during
scenario-based tests. With the help of the proposed surrogate
modeling method, the limits of current safety technologies can be
demonstrated and new concepts for better protection of vehicle
occupants can be developed.
2.2. Sampling methods
Mathematical surrogate models solely rely on the quality of the
input data X and output data Y. In engineering, the training data
is either available from prior simulation or experimental results
or has to be generated only for surrogate modeling purposes. In
this study, simulation for machine learning is done, i.e., a Madymo
simulation with a computation time of ∼2 his performed for
each sample in the training set. The samples have to be chosen
strategically to minimize the computational expenses for training
data generation.
Design of experiments methods (see e.g., [19, 20]), aim at
maximizing the information extracted from resource-constrained
systems. Therefore, design of experiment methods are well suited
to select the most suitable parameter combination to maximize
the information extraction in the surrogate modeling process. The
design of experiments oﬀers a wide range of statistical sampling
methods, which can be divided into static and adaptive methods. D-
optimal design and space-ﬁlling design are static sampling methods
that determine the sample distribution a-priori; a third sampling

method used in this publication, “Adaptive Sampling”, adapts the
samples in an online step. A challenge in occupant simulations is
that not all parameters are continuously adjustable. Thus, sampling
methods that consider constraints and bounds need to be chosen,
or existing methods need to be modiﬁed. As learning is new in
occupant simulation the accuracy of the resulting surrogate models
in dependence on the chosen sampling strategy is assessed using a
test dataset.
2.2.1. D-optimal design
The d-optimal is a computer-aided design, which is well
suited for constrained design spaces [21]. The optimization-based
design maximizes the determinant D =
XTX
, also known as
information matrix, which is equal to minimizing the variance of
the parameter estimates. A d-optimal design is thus not orthogonal,
and correlations of the parameter estimates are possible. The
chosen samples are mostly present at the edges of the parameter
space, with only a few samples in the inner part. In this study, a
d-optimal design with 100 samples was created in the commercial
tool Cornerstone (Version 7.1).2
2.2.2. Space-ﬁlling design
Space-ﬁlling approaches, such as Latin Hypercubes, provide
better coverage of the inner parameter space than d-optimal designs
[22]. With higher dimensionality of a dataset, the probability of
insigniﬁcant parameters is increasing. Thus, a space-ﬁlling design
will yield a higher information gain with the same computational
eﬀort. Hence, surrogate models trained with a space-ﬁlling dataset
are expected to make predictions with higher accuracy in the inner
part of the parameter space than a model trained on d-optimal
data. However, samples are less represented at the parameter

space edges, so the space-ﬁlling surrogate model might return
more inaccurate extrapolations. A space-ﬁlling design, however,
requires all parameters to be adjustable to all possible values
in the chosen interval. Since only nine head positions are used
for training, see Section 2.1 “Simulation Framework for Training
Data Generation”, the space-ﬁlling design has to be modiﬁed.
Instead of using the head position calculated by the space-ﬁlling
design, the Euclidian-norm measured nearest neighbor in the
available positions in Figure 6 is selected. Two datasets with
100 samples each are generated with the space-ﬁlling design
in Cornerstone, one for training and one for validation of the
surrogate models.
2.2.3. Adaptive sampling
In contrast to statistical sampling methods, which determine
the sample size and location in advance, an adaptive sampling
scheme allows to sequentially sample the parameter space and take
the surrogate model accuracy and prediction variance into account
[23]. Surrogate models such as GPRs provide the variance—an
estimate of the model’s accuracy— in addition to the prediction,
so that the input parameter combination with the highest variance
can be determined. Sampling iteratively at the points of maximum
variance, the model accuracy is increased until a termination
criterion is reached, see the example in Figure 7.
Possible termination criteria include the maximum variance
and the change in hyperparameters that are indicators for the
model performance and under- or overﬁtting. A better choice
for estimating the true model accuracy is the cross-validation
error. Hence, in each iteration, a leave-one-out cross-validation
is performed to approximate the prediction error. The adaptive
sampling algorithm is implemented in python.
2.3. Gaussian process regression
A Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a Bayesian approach
to regression which infers unseen data given a chosen prior
distribution [24]. In comparison to other machine learning
algorithms, Gaussian processes provide a variance in addition to
the mean prediction, which can be thought of as an estimate
of the model’s accuracy. Furthermore, GPRs are well suited for
smaller datasets.
Assuming a zero mean, the joint multivariate prior for the
training outputs y and test outputs f reads as

will pass through all samples. Notice that most of the information
is embedded in the kernel K. Therefore, the selection of the kernel
has major inﬂuences on the accuracy of a gaussian process. Two
popular choices of the kernel are the squared exponential (SE) and

The covariance can later be used to assess the model quality

2.4. Surrogate model training process
In order to develop a surrogate model for occupant safety
system simulations, training data is generated with the Madymo
AHM for all three sampling methods. Subsequently, a GPR is
trained on each of the training datasets consisting of the input data
in Table 1 and the corresponding HIC36 and chest deﬂection as
output. The chest deﬂection is assumed to be smoothly distributed
over the entire parameter range and thus, a squared exponential
kernel is chosen for constructing the GPR. The HIC36 response
surface is however believed to have a rougher shape, due to
nonlinearities resulting from airbag and steering wheel contact.
Thus, a Matern kernel is used to model the HIC36 response. After

training, all surrogate models are validated on the test set which
contains 100 space-ﬁlling samples. In order to assess the model
quality in a more general and sampling method independent way,
all the samples that were not used for training are added to the test
dataset, which results in the training and joint test sets in Table 2.
The accuracy of the surrogate models is then assessed using the
mean absolute error (MAE) and coeﬃcient of determination (R2
score). By analyzing the kernel hyperparameters and the shape of
the response surface overﬁtting is evaluated.
2.5. Restraint system optimization
The best performing model is later applied for an optimization
of the restraint system parameters. Since the objective function
should reduce the combined AIS2+ injury risk for HIC36 and chest
deﬂection, ﬁrst the individual injury risks [26] are computed as
PHead,AIS2+ = N

A joint injury risk [27] can then be calculated with
Pjoint,AIS2+ = PHead,AIS2+ + PThorax,AIS2+
−


.
(10)
To ﬁnd the optimal restraint system conﬁguration that best
protects the occupant, an optimizer is used to minimize the AIS2+
injury risk for each given collision scenario. Since surrogate model
are used to approximate the injury risk, an optimizer that is not
gradient-based and can handle discontinuities is required. Thus,
the diﬀerential evolution algorithm [28], a global optimizer, is used
in this work.
First an objective function f is deﬁned. Then the following
algorithm is performed.

with the crossover probability CR and the diﬀerential weight F.
Typical settings are CR = 0.9 and F = 0.8.
3. Results
Before generating the entire training dataset, a two-dimensional
subset of the parameter space, consisting of the retractor
pretensioner load limiter and the airbag time to ﬁre, was densely
sampled to get an understanding of the resulting response surfaces.
In Figure 8 the response surfaces of HIC36 and chest deﬂection
are shown over the retractor pretensioner load limiter (ll) and the
airbag time to ﬁre. The response surface of the HIC36 is rougher
and nonlinear in comparison to the smooth response surface of
the chest deﬂection. This justiﬁes the diﬀerent kernel choice for
modeling the HIC36 and chest deﬂection distribution.
Subsequently, the sampling methods are used for training data
generation. As expected, the d-optimal design samples mostly at the
edges, whereas the space-ﬁlling design covers the entire parameter
space (see Figure 9, Appendix 1).
The adaptive sampling strategy on the other hand, chooses its
next sample based on the variance of the GPR prediction, which
continuously increases with the distance to given samples. Thus,
an adaptive sampling algorithm will start to sample the edges
before covering the inner part of the parameter space. A nine-
dimensional parameter space with 29 vertices will thus cause the
algorithm to sample at the edges almost exclusively for the ﬁrst
few hundred simulations. The adaptive sampling algorithm was
aborted after 500 simulations, as the ratio of computational eﬀort to
prediction accuracy didn’t signiﬁcantly improve. The diﬀerence in
the response surface of HIC36 and chest deﬂection is also reﬂecting
in the error curve in Figure 10. During the ﬁrst 50 iterations the
chest deﬂection MAE is already reduced to a low value and is
slightly decreasing in the remaining iterations. The rougher shape
of the HIC36 response surface however requires a more signiﬁcant
number of samples to reach the desired accuracy.
The three datasets that are generated with a d-optimal, space-
ﬁlling and adaptive sampling, result in diﬀerent distributions of the
HIC36 and chest deﬂection (see Figure 11).
The majority of the HIC36 values are allocated in a range
below 750. Figure 11 suggests that high HIC36 values only occur
at the edges of the input parameter space, as no HIC36 values
above 500 are observable in the space-ﬁlling dataset and only
the d-optimal design shows HIC36 values up to 1,800. As the
adaptive sampling algorithm chooses the ﬁrst samples primarily
at the edges of the parameter space, the adaptive sampling
dataset also includes a few samples with larger HIC36 values.
The chest deﬂection on the other hand is well distributed over
the entire domain, where only the d-optimal data set shows very
small values.
3.1. Surrogate model performance
A GPR is trained on each of the d-optimal, space-ﬁlling
and adaptive sampling datasets and validated on the test sets in
Table 2. For zero noise the GPR predictions will go through every
given sample in the training set. Therefore, the analysis of the
predicted results focuses on the test data. Overﬁtting can still be
excluded as the lengthscales of the surrogate model are each in a
moderate range around 1 [24], which results in a smooth response
surface (see Appendix 2). Figure 12 shows the prediction of HIC36
and chest deﬂection over the test data. The red line represents
identical prediction and simulation results. In general, all surrogate
models are able to predict the chest deﬂection values in the entire
range with higher accuracy, while the HIC36 predictions are only
accurate in the lower range. Since only the d-optimal design data
incorporates very large HIC36 values and low chest deﬂections, the
GPR trained on the d-optimal dataset tends to overshoot the HIC36
and underestimate the chest deﬂection values.
Both the models trained on the space-ﬁlling and adaptive
sampling dataset predict HIC36 and chest deﬂection with higher
accuracy, resulting in smaller MAE and larger R2 score (see

Tables 3, 4). The model trained on the space-ﬁlling set shows a
larger error on the d-optimal and adaptive sampling set, which
contain more samples at the edges of the parameter space and HIC
values in a wider range. However, it performs well on the test set.
The model trained on the adaptive sampling set shows the best and
most robust performance on all test sets (see Appendix 4).
The surrogate model reduces test data computation time from
the order of hours with Madymo to milliseconds for predicting
HIC36 and chest deﬂection.
3.2. Restraint system optimization
Once eﬃcient surrogate models are available it is possible to
optimize the restraint system parameters individually for all 285
collision scenarios. For a given head position and collision scenario
a diﬀerential evolution algorithm uses the injury value predictions
by the GPR to ﬁnd the optimal restraint system parameter
conﬁguration that minimizes the joint AIS2+ injury risk for the
given load-case. A convergence plot of the diﬀerential evolution
algorithm is shown in Figure 12A. On average, 30 iterations are
needed to ﬁnd the optimal restraint system conﬁguration. Thus,
with a population size of 50, an average of 1,500 evaluations
are performed per load case. This is only possible with the help
of time-eﬃcient surrogate models. Due to the fast prediction of
injury values, an optimization is possible in 0.9973 ± 0.2976 s. The
predicted injury risk distribution before and after the optimization
is illustrated in Figure 13.
For all trajectories and collision scenarios the joint AIS2+
injury risk can be reduced by 4% in average. The analysis of
the optimized restrained system parameter showed no direct
correlation to the input parameter, so a categorical adaptation of the
restraint system for speciﬁc parameter regions does not make sense.
As the overall simulation process includes multiple FEM and
MBS simulations the computation of high-ﬁdelity results is rather
expensive. Therefore, only a subset of the available scenarios, which

showed the largest injury risk reduction, was chosen for validation
of the optimization results. As illustrated in Figure 14 the joint
AIS 2+ injury risk computed with the surrogate model predictions
mostly shows lower values than the simulation. However, the
surrogate model manages to capture the overall relations and is able
to ﬁnd minima in the predicted response surface that correlate with
the high-ﬁdelity FEM and MBS simulation.
4. Discussion
In this study, a surrogate model for predicting the human
body model response in frontal collisions was developed.
In comparison to [13–15] the developed surrogate model
approximates the HIC36 and chest deﬂection of the driver
based on the occupant’s head position resulting from pre-crash
movement, the collision conﬁguration and selected restraint system
parameters. Furthermore, the developed surrogate model was used
for a subsequent optimization of the restraint system parameters.
The surrogate model was trained on simulations with a Madymo
AHM, which is considered the baseline. Therefore, the model
accuracy is not expected to surpass the accuracy of the Madymo
simulation model.
The main focus of this study was the assessment of diﬀerent
sampling strategies to address the tradeoﬀbetween computational
eﬀort for training data generation and resulting surrogate model
accuracy. Overall, the models trained on the d-optimal, space-
ﬁlling and adaptive sampling dataset performed well in predicting
the chest deﬂection, which has a smooth response surface (see
Figure 8).
The model trained on the d-optimal dataset shows the lowest
accuracy on all test sets (see Table 3). Due to a large number of
samples at the edges of the parameter space (see Figure 9), the d-
optimal model is not able to accurately interpolate in the inner part
of the parameter space.
The prediction of the HIC36 is less accurate, especially in
the region of high HIC36 values (see Figure 12). These high
HIC36 values occur at the edges of the parameter space, leading
to an extrapolation of the surrogate models. The high injury
values can be explained by the variation of the restraint system
parameters, since, for example, as shown in Figure 8, a low
seat belt load limit (pretensioner ll) causes a severe impact
on the airbag and a direct contact with the steering wheel,
while a too high limit restraints the occupant too tightly to the
seat and thus causes moderate head accelerations and a high
chest deﬂection.
The model based on the space-ﬁlling strategy provides the
chest deﬂection with an acceptable accuracy but fails to predict
a HIC36 larger than 500 (see Figure 12), as the space-ﬁlling
training set does not contain any larger values, as shown in
Figure 11. Since the training set is well distributed in the entire
parameter space, the model is able to accurately interpolate in
the desired range. All large HIC36 values are distributed at the
edges of the parameter space and thus only present in the d-
optimal and partially in the adaptive sampling data set (see
Figure 11).
Therefore, the adaptive sampling model performs better on
the test datasets. However, the prediction of large HIC36 values is
not suﬃciently accurate. Furthermore, the creation of the adaptive
sampling data set required ﬁve times more simulations than the
d-optimal and space-ﬁlling design.
One drawback of the developed surrogate models is the
low accuracy in the higher HIC36 range, which are mostly
occurring
at
the
edges
of
the
parameter
space
and
are
underrepresented in all training sets. By generating more
samples with high HIC36 values, the model accuracy could
be improved in this range. As the correlation between input
parameter and injury values is unknown, this task is expected to
be challenging. One possible solution could be the application of
an adaptive sampling algorithm with the objective of maximizing
the HIC36.

diﬀerential evolution algorithm for one exemplary collision scenario.
Without an accurate prediction of the entire HIC36 range,
a valid prediction range in the parameter space must be
deﬁned to apply the model for quantitative safety critical
analysis. An a priori classiﬁcation of the HIC36 range and
training of a second model for large HIC36 values might
be possible.
For qualitative analyses considering the inner part of the
parameter range the accuracy of the developed surrogate model
appears to be suﬃcient, so that the model can be applied
for injury value prediction and restraint system optimization.
The developed surrogate model is able to approximate the
HIC36 and chest deﬂection with a computation time reduction
of roughly 99% compared to a simulation with the Madymo
AHM. With the reduced computation time the surrogate model
enables large scale scenario-based assessment of vehicle safety
systems. In addition, the surrogate model allows an eﬃcient
optimization of the restraint system for a given collision
scenario and thus a reduction of the resulting joint AIS2+
injury risk. The comparison of the predicted and optimized
joint AIS2+ risk with the FEM and Madymo results showed
that the surrogate model manages to capture the basic trends
and reduces the joint AIS2+ injury risk in the validation

4.1. Limitation of the study
One drawback of the developed surrogate models is the
low accuracy in the higher HIC36 range, which are mostly
occurring
at
the
edges
of
the
parameter
space
and
are
underrepresented in all training sets. By generating more
samples with high HIC36 values, the model accuracy could
be improved in this range. As the correlation between input
parameter and injury values is unknown, this task is expected to
be challenging. One possible solution could be the application
of an adaptive sampling algorithm / active learning techniques
with the objective of maximizing the HIC36. For d-optimal
sampling further research is required to assess whether an
increased sample size in a d-optimal sense could improve the
model performance.
If a higher accuracy of the training set is desired, the entire
process can be repeated with a more detailed occupant model,
i.e., a ﬁnite element model. Then, however, the computation
time for training data generation would increase tremendously.
In addition, the surrogate model is only valid for the chosen
restraint system, vehicle type and occupant –the training data
and result prediction was on the 50% AHM with a restraint
system consisting of ﬁxed components, i.e., one airbag and
one retractor pretensioner. For a broad-scale application of the
presented method, the sensitivity of the surrogate models to
diﬀerent occupant sizes (starting from 5% and 95% parameters
should be investigated, in combination with varied restraint
systems components and parameters. So far any change in
the vehicle structure or restraint system conﬁguration, e.g.,
new type of airbag, new training of the surrogate model
is required.
To date, only pairwise evaluations of the forecasted and
optimized combined AIS2+ risk have been conducted. In a further
study the optimization of the safety system should be performed
with a high-ﬁdelity model or a multiﬁdelity method [29]. R2
values for HIC and chest deﬂection prediction are presented in the
Tables 5, 6 for all available datasets.
5. Conclusion
As driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles become
more prevalent, the safety systems in vehicles are becoming
increasingly intricate. This complexity oﬀers the potential to
enhance occupant safety by utilizing sensor data from active safety
systems to adjust passive safety components. To eﬀectively evaluate
the performance of these integrated safety systems, it is necessary
to consider all relevant load cases. Scenario-based methods are
required to achieve a comprehensive evaluation. The resulting
insights can inform strategic decisions and enable early product
placement during development.
Overall, reducing the computational cost of simulating
integrated vehicle safety systems will be an important area of
research in the future, as it will enable researchers and engineers
to evaluate all relevant load cases. Crash simulations often involve
large amounts of data, which can be diﬃcult to process and
analyze. Therefore, one challenge and the main topic of this
work was providing the data in such a format that the data-
based MOR method could eﬃciently work with the data, and we
can compare which sampling strategy is most suited for crash

simulations to gain the maximum out of the minimum amount
of simulation.
In this study, the space-ﬁlling design provides the highest
information gain and accuracy in relation to the number of
samples and should be preferred for future applications. The
adaptive sampling method then oﬀers the possibility to further
increase the prediction accuracy if computational resources
are available.
As we have seen, the space-ﬁlling design provides the highest
information gain and accuracy to the number of samples and
should be preferred for future applications.
As we have seen, data-based MOR could be challenging for
crash simulation because the model’s response can jump once
we leave the intended mode of operation of the safety system.
Therefore, active learning approaches to ﬁnd those critical modes
of operation are worth further research.
The developed surrogate models provide only qualitative
insights; if highly accurate results are required, a thorough
assessment or validation with high-ﬁdelity simulations must
be performed. Comprehensive computer-based experiments and
workﬂows must include surrogates in the development loop. Once
the surrogates are part of the workﬂow, they should be permanently
monitored and retrained using all available data in the automotive
industry. Hence, it is imperative to invest in eﬃcient workﬂow
technologies for labeling and accessing vast amounts of information
to ensure a good and eﬀective workﬂow with surrogate models in
the future.
