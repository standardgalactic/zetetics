Abstract. This is the ﬁrst paper in a series where we study collisions of nucleated bub-
bles taking into account the eﬀects of small initial (quantum) ﬂuctuations in a fully 3+1-
dimensional setting. In this paper, we consider the evolution of linear ﬂuctuations around
highly symmetric though inhomogeneous backgrounds. In particular, we demonstrate that a
large degree of asymmetry develops over time from tiny initial ﬂuctuations superposed upon
planar and SO(2,1) symmetric backgrounds. These ﬂuctuations are inevitable consequences
of zero-point vacuum oscillations, so excluding them by enforcing a high degree of spatial
symmetry is inconsistent in a quantum treatment. To simplify the analysis we consider the
limit of two colliding planar walls, with mode functions for the ﬂuctuations characterized by
the wavenumber transverse to the collision direction and a longitudinal shape along the colli-
sion direction x, which we solve for. In the linear regime, the ﬂuctuations obey a linear wave
equation with a time- and space-dependent mass meff(x, t). In situations where the walls
collide multiple times, meff oscillates in time. We use Floquet theory to study the evolution
of the ﬂuctuations and generalize the calculations familiar from the preheating literature to
the case with many coupled degrees of freedom. The inhomogeneous case has bands of un-
stable transverse wavenumbers k⊥whose corresponding mode functions grow exponentially.
By examining the detailed spatial structure of the mode functions in x, we identify both
broad and narrow parametric resonance generalizations of the homogeneous meff(t) case of
preheating. The unstable k⊥modes are longitudinally localized, yet can be described as
quasiparticles in the Bogoliubov sense. We deﬁne an eﬀective occupation number and show
they are created in bursts for the case of well-deﬁned collisions in the background.
The
transverse-longitudinal coupling accompanying nonlinearity radically breaks this localized
particle description, with nonseparable 3D modes arising that will be studied in subsequent
papers.

Introduction
We study the behaviour of linearized ﬂuctuations around colliding scalar ﬁeld domain walls
in situations where the walls possess a high degree of spatial symmetry. Domain walls arise
when discrete symmetries are spontaneously broken and are familiar from the magnetic do-
mains formed in ferromagnets. In the context of the early universe they can form in both
high-temperature and vacuum phase transitions, either through self-ordering dynamics fol-
lowing a rapid quench or as the walls of nucleated bubbles during a ﬁrst-order transition.
However, if the walls are stable, their energy density falls only as the square of the expansion
factor, strongly constraining the allowed outcome of these phase transitions. Domain walls
and similar objects such as D-branes are also a common ingredient in early universe model
building. Examples include braneworld cosmologies in which our observable dimensions are
conﬁned to either a lower-dimensional brane or a domain wall embedded in a higher di-
mensional space [1–5], inﬂationary cosmologies including stacks of D-branes [6, 7], and some
cyclic cosmologies [8].
– 1 –

In a complete theory the domain walls interact with their own dynamics, either inherited
from an underlying scalar ﬁeld theory or intrinsically in the case of D-branes. When several
such walls are present, the evolution may result in collisions. In some cases, such as the self-
ordering after a quench or a rapid percolating ﬁrst-order phase transition, the domain walls
form a complicated network with interactions and collisions occurring in a wide variety of
orientations. However, in other scenarios the collisions possess a large amount of symmetry,
such as planar symmetry or SO(2,1) symmetry. These highly symmetric conﬁgurations may
arise from tuning of the initial conditions as in braneworld cosmologies. In other cases, the
dynamics naturally lead to symmetric collisions, although the underlying theory might still
require tuning to realize the appropriate limit (e.g., of planarity). An example of this is
tuning to ensure a slow ﬁrst order phase transition where collisions are infrequent and the
bubbles expand to several times their initial radius before colliding.
Here our focus is on the particular case of colliding parallel planar walls formed by the
condensate of some scalar ﬁeld φ. The qualitative behaviour of the ﬂuctuations around the
planar walls also carries over to the case of collisions with an SO(2,1) symmetry.
These
two symmetry assumptions — planar and SO(2,1) — are widely invoked to study collisions
in braneworld scenarios [5, 9–11] and false vacuum decay [12], respectively. In both cases,
assuming so much symmetry reduces the underlying ﬁeld equations to a one-dimensional
nonlinear wave equation. This reduction greatly simpliﬁes the problem and has been central
to many past studies of domain wall collisions. We use the solutions to these one-dimensional
nonlinear wave equations as backgrounds upon which our ﬂuctuations are superposed.
An important diﬀerence between the classical and quantum problems, which has been
neglected in previous work, is the extent to which the dynamical evolution preserves the
initially assumed symmetries.
While the classical dynamics may possess exact planar or
SO(2,1) symmetry, the quantum ﬂuctuations break the symmetry in any realization, albeit
at quite a small level initially. These ﬂuctuations may be subject to unstable growth as the
combined background plus ﬂuctuation system evolves, with the early stages of the instability
described by the linearized perturbation equations we solve for in this paper. If the ﬂuctua-
tions grow they will have considerable backreaction and rescattering eﬀects on the symmetric
part of the ﬁeld, which can signiﬁcantly modify the overall dynamics. A proper treatment
of these eﬀects requires studying the nonlinear problem and is the subject of two companion
papers [13] and [14].
We restrict our considerations to two diﬀerent single-ﬁeld scalar theories possessing
domain wall solutions. We refer to this ﬁeld φ as the symmetry breaking scalar ﬁeld. The
background spacetime is assumed to be Minkowski throughout. In addition to the choice of
underlying theory, the evolution of the ﬂuctuations depends on the particular background
around which we expand the ﬂuctuations. Therefore, we consider a variety of collisions in each
potential. We show that nonplanar ﬂuctuations in φ can experience exponential instabilities
for a broad class of collisions.
Our analysis uses Floquet theory applied to a non-separable PDE. This generalizes the
techniques used in preheating, where the spatial homogeneity of the background results in
Floquet theory applied to the ODE for the ﬂuctuations. We ﬁnd generalizations of broad
parametric resonance and narrow parametric resonance to the case of ﬂuctuations around a
spatially inhomogeneous background.
Although we focus on two speciﬁc scalar ﬁeld models, the dynamical mechanism that
leads to the rapid growth of ﬂuctuations is much more general. As we will explicitly demon-
strate, the broad parametric resonance instability is essentially particle production in the
– 2 –

Bogoliubov sense for ﬂuctuations bound to the walls. These ﬂuctuations are the transverse
generalization of the Goldstone mode arising from the spontaneous breaking of translation
invariance by the domain wall. Therefore, these modes exist for any membrane-like struc-
ture appearing in a translation invariant theory. Examples of such membrane-like structures
include domain walls in other ﬁeld theories and D-branes in string theory. When the two
“branes” are well separated, the ﬂuctuations are trapped by an eﬀective potential well. As
long as the shape of these wells is modiﬁed by the collision we expect similar instabilities to
arise regardless of the underlying theory.
The remainder of this paper explores the rich dynamics of linear ﬂuctuations around
colliding domain walls. We ﬁrst introduce our two models in section 2 and present the domain
wall solutions that each potential supports. In section 3 we introduce our decomposition of
the ﬁeld into a background and ﬂuctuations, followed by a review of the background dynamics.
The central analysis in contained in section 4, where we use Floquet theory to understand
the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations.
We provide instability charts for the ﬂuctuations and
study the mode functions in detail. We also comment on the applicability of our results
to a broader class of theories. Finally, in section 5 we brieﬂy comment on the implications
for SO(2,1) bubble collisions. We present our conclusions of this linear study in section 6.
Some of the more technical details explaining the construction of approximate background
solutions are contained in appendix A. Details of our numerical methods and convergence
tests demonstrating their superb accuracy and convergence properties are in appendix B.

Model Lagrangians and Domain Wall Solutions
In this section, we introduce the two potentials we consider, review the domain wall solutions
each supports and discuss the types of perturbations that exist around these solutions. Since
we will ultimately work in three spatial dimensions, we also discuss the embedding of lower-
dimensional domain wall solutions in three dimensions.
Our ﬁrst choice of potential is
the sine −Gordon model : V (φ) = Λ

n ∈Z .
(2.2)
These solutions interpolate between neighbouring minima of the potential (2.1) with φ(∞) =
φ(−∞) + 2π, and they are the one dimensional version of domain walls. Here x0 determines
the spatial position of the kink and n is an integer determining which minima the kink
interpolates between. There is also a corresponding antikink solution which is obtained by
the substitution (x −x0) →−(x −x0). Kinks moving at a constant velocity can be obtained
by Lorentz boosting the static solution.
At linear order in one spatial dimension the only normalizable localized perturbation of
the kink is the zero mode corresponding to an inﬁnitesimal translation of the centre of mass

δ is an adjustable parameter controlling the diﬀerence between the

potential supports spatially dependent ﬁeld conﬁgurations in which the ﬁeld is localized near
each of the minima in diﬀerent regions of space, with the requisite domain-wall structures
interpolating between the diﬀerent regions.
A well known example occurs for δ = 0 in one spatial dimension. In this case, the kink

Moving kinks are again obtained by Lorentz boosting. Unlike the sine-Gordon model, which
posesses a single bound state excitation, the one-dimensional double-well kink has two lo-
calized normalizable linear perturbations. There is also a continuum of delocalized radiative
modes with frequencies ω2 ≥2. The localized perturbations are often referred to as the

The translation mode corresponds to a spatial translation of the centre of the kink and is
thus analogous to the sine-Gordon zero mode. The shape mode is an internal excitation
which can be thought of as an oscillating wall width.
Kink-like solutions continue to exist as we deform the potential by increasing δ. How-
ever, the potential energy diﬀerence between the two minima causes the “wall” to accelerate,
so the kink solutions are no longer time-independent in inertial reference frames.
In three spatial dimensions domain walls become embedded two-dimensional hypersur-
faces with some small but ﬁnite width. We consider two cases that possess a high degree of
spatial symmetry. Our main focus is planar walls generated by extending the sine-Gordon
and double-well kink solutions to the additional two spatial directions. We will also study
bubbles of “true vacuum” nucleating within the false vacuum in the double-well potential,
restricting to choices of δ in the double-well potential for which these false vacuum bubbles
are well described by the Coleman-deLuccia (CdL) instanton [15–17]. In Minkowski space
at zero temperature, the most likely initial bubble proﬁle possesses an SO(4) symmetry in
Euclidean signature [18] with proﬁle determined by

where r2
E = r2 + τ 2, τ is the Euclidean time and d is the number of spatial dimensions. The
initial bubble proﬁle is obtained by analytically continuing back to real time. In the thin
wall limit (valid if the initial radius of the bubble is much greater than the thickness of the
wall), the friction term in (2.8) is dropped and we are left with the same equation as for a
domain wall in the corresponding 1 + 1-dimensional theory. In this limit, the initial bubble
radius is given by

form of the potential (2.4).

Dynamics of Planar Symmetric Collisions
We now study (nonplanar) ﬂuctuations around colliding parallel planar domain walls. We
treat this case ﬁrst because the scale associated with the overall radius of the bubbles does
not enter the problem, so parallel domain walls constitute a slightly simpler arena in which
to illustrate the underlying ﬂuctuation dynamics. In the limit that the bubbles have radii
much larger than any other relevant scale in the problem we also expect bubble collisions to
be reasonably approximated by two colliding planar walls.

3.1
General Formalism
Our setup consists of a kink starting at x = −xinit and moving to the right and an antikink
starting at x = xinit and moving to the left. For ease of nomenclature, we refer to this as a
K ¯K pair. We take the collision axis to be the x direction and split the ﬁeld as
φ(x, y, z, t) = φbg(x, t) + δφ(x, y, z, t)
(3.1)
where the ﬂuctuations satisfy ⟨δφ(x, y, z, t)⟩= 0. The planar symmetry allows us to approxi-
mate ensemble averages with averages over the (y, z) plane. Before solving for the ﬂuctuation
ﬁeld we must ﬁnd the background solution around which to perturb. If backreaction and
rescattering eﬀects are ignored the background ﬁeld φbg undergoes the same dynamic evolu-
tion as in 1+1-dimensions, namely
∂2φbg
∂t2
−∂2φbg
∂x2 + V ′(φbg) = 0 ,
(3.2)
with initial conditions given by the K ¯K pair. Meanwhile, the linearized equation for the
ﬂuctuations is

dydze−i(kyy+kzz)δφ is the 2D Fourier transform of δφ in the directions
transverse to the collision axis and k2
⊥≡k2

z. We refer to these planar symmetry breaking
ﬂuctuations as transverse. At this level of approximation, the ﬂuctuation δφ behaves as a free
ﬁeld with a time and x-dependent eﬀective mass (V ′′(φbg(x, t)) determined independently by
the background evolution.
If the system is discretized in the x direction, it is just a collection of coupled oscillators.
In real space this coupling occurs via our choice of discretization of the Laplacian term, while
in momentum space (along x) the oscillators couple via the Fourier transform of V ′′(x, t). This
makes it evident that, for a given V ′′(x, t), the (time-dependent) ’normal’ mode oscillations
fully describe the system. Of course, the rate at which the discretized system converges to
the continuum result depends upon our choice of spatial discretization. Nonetheless, we will
show that this approach can be carried out approximately and it provides useful insights into
the behaviour of the ﬂuctuations.
In this paper we use a Fourier pseudospectral approximation to discretize ∂xx, thus
obtaining exponential convergence as we increase the number of grid sites for a ﬁxed box
size. Details about our precise numerical procedures as a well as a demonstration of the
superb convergence properties of our techniques can be found in appendix B.
3.2
Dynamics of the Planar Background
We now brieﬂy review the background dynamics for colliding planar domain walls in our
two chosen potentials. These background solutions determine the form of V ′′(φbg(x, t)) to
use as input in the ﬂuctuation equation (3.3). The planar symmetry allows us to reduce the
background dynamics to that of a K ¯K pair interacting in 1+1-dimensions.
3.2.1
sine-Gordon Model
This model is particularly useful because in one spatial dimension it is integrable and the kink
and antikink solutions are true solitons — they interact with each other while preserving their
– 6 –

shapes at early and late times. More importantly, there exist analytically known periodic
breather solutions

(3.4)
where v > 0 is a free parameter determining the properties of the breather solution and
γv ≡(1 + v2)−1/2 [19]. For v ≪1 the kink and antikink pair are well separated at t = 0
and have initial positions xinit ≈±
√
1 + v2 ln(0.5v), whereas for larger v they are much more
tightly bound and the breather is a localized oscillating blob of ﬁeld with size

3.2.2
Double Well Model
The background evolution in this potential (2.4) is more complicated, but it has been studied
by many other authors who detail a rich phenomenology [20–24]. The kinks in this model
are solitary waves rather than true solitons, and thus they emit radiation when they interact.
Combined with excitation of the internal mode during collisions, this means that the motion
– 7 –

is no longer exactly periodic. Because we do not have exact solutions to (3.2), we must
resort to numerical simulations. We use a Gauss Legendre time-integration combined with
a Fourier pseudospectral discretization, which allows us to obtain machine precision results
for both the spatial discretization and time-evolution. Details are provided in appendix B.
We restrict our attention to a kink-antikink pair characterized by an initial separation and
speciﬁed initial velocities. For more general setups, the interested reader should consult the
previously cited works for the wide range of interesting phenomenology that can arise.
To simplify our analysis we work in the centre of mass frame. We take the initial kink
and antikink speeds u and separations dsep as free parameters. Some illustrative examples of
the dynamics are shown in ﬁgure 3.

Figure 3. Sample evolutions of the symmetry breaking ﬁeld φ in kink-antikink collisions for the
double-well potential as a function of time and position along the collision axis. Blue corresponds
to ﬁeld values on the true vacuum side of the potential, red to values on the false vacuum side, and
white to values near the top of the potential. The spatial coordinates are chosen so that the collision
occurs at the origin. Three choices of initial velocity in the symmetric well illustrate three diﬀerent
types of behaviour: for u = 0.05 (top left) the K ¯K pair capture each other and form a long-lived
bound state rather than immediately annihilating. For u = 0.2 the kinks are in an escape resonance
(top right), and a collision above the critical escape velocity (u = 0.3) appears in the bottom left.
The bottom-right shows the behaviour for an asymmetric double well with δ = 1/30 and the K ¯K
pair starting from rest at a separation dsep = 16m−1, where m is the eﬀective mass. In all cases, the
oscillation of the internal shape mode is visible as an oscillating wall width.
In the symmetric well the attractive force between the kink and antikink decreases
exponentially at large separations, and as a result unbound motions with the kink escaping
back to inﬁnity are possible.
For low initial velocities (u ≲0.15), the K and ¯K always
capture each other after colliding and do not escape back to inﬁnity — see ﬁgure 3, top left,
– 8 –

for an example with u = 0.05. Rather than immediately annihilating into radiation, the kinks
bounce oﬀeach other several times and then settle into a long-lived oscillatory blob known
as an oscillon (here living in one dimension). During each oscillation, some energy is radiated
away, so this localized state eventually decays. However, the rate of energy loss is slow and
the oscillons can persist for thousands of oscillations (or more) before ﬁnally disappearing.
As the incident velocity increases, the kinks enter a “resonant escape” regime character-
ized by bands of incident velocities in which the two kinks eventually escape back to inﬁnity.
The escape bands are separated by bands in which the K ¯K pair trap each other and form
an oscillon as in the low velocity limit (see e.g. [23]). Within each escape band, the number
of bounces the walls undergo before escaping back to inﬁnity is a very complicated function
of the incident velocity. This seemingly strange behaviour is usually attributed to the shape
mode. At each collision, nonlinear interactions transfer some of the kinks’ translational ki-
netic energy into a homogeneous excitation of the shape mode or vice versa. The direction
of energy transfer depends on the oscillation phases of the two shape modes (one on the kink
and one on the antikink). As a result, the kinetic energy of the kinks can decrease in one
bounce as the shape mode is excited causing the K ¯K pair to become temporarily trapped. In
the subsequent collision some of this stored energy can then be transferred back into overall
translational motion, giving the kink and antikink enough translational kinetic energy to
escape back to inﬁnity. An example of this behaviour for u = 0.2 is illustrated in the upper
right panel of ﬁgure 3. In the ﬁrst collision, the K ¯K pair loses some energy to radiation and
excites internal shape modes. At the second collision, energy is transferred from the shape
mode back into translational kinetic energy and the kinks escape each other.
A critical velocity exists above which the K ¯K pair always interacts exactly once before
escaping back to inﬁnity. During the collision, some of the energy escapes as radiation. The
remaining energy ﬂows between the shape and translational modes of the kink. Provided
that the shape modes are not initially excited, the outgoing velocities of the two walls are
thus always less than their incident velocities. This sort of interaction appears in the bottom
left panel of ﬁgure 3.
When we take δ > 0, (i.e. make the double well asymmetric), the diﬀerence in vacuum
energies across the kink causes an acceleration toward the false vacuum side. The kink and
antikink experience an approximately constant attractive force at large separations. As a
result, the kinks are no longer able to escape back to inﬁnity and will always undergo multiple
collisions while slowly radiating energy. Eventually, an oscillon forms at the location of the
original collision. See the bottom right panel of ﬁgure 3 for an example of kinks interacting
in an asymmetric double well.
In all cases discussed above the shape mode is excited by the collisions. This is visible
as an oscillating wall thickness, as seen in ﬁgure 3.

Dynamics of Linear Fluctuations
In the previous section we brieﬂy reviewed the dynamics of planar symmetric background
ﬁeld solutions.
The key feature for our analysis is the presence of oscillatory behaviour:
the walls typically bounce oﬀeach other many times or settle into a localized bound state
rather than immediately annihilating, and internal vibration modes of the walls are excited
in the collisions. We now study the transverse ﬂuctuations described by (3.3) in these types
of oscillating backgrounds Our focus is whether small initial (transverse) perturbations to
the background dynamics illustrated in ﬁgure 2 and ﬁgure 3 can be ampliﬁed to the extent
– 9 –

that they become important to the full ﬁeld dynamics. The results presented in this section
are the main ﬁndings of our analysis.
We plot (in)stability charts for linear ﬂuctuations
around various choices of planar collision backgrounds for both the sine-Gordon and double-
well potentials. In addition, we study several representative choices of the unstable mode
functions, which provides insight into the qualitative structure of the instability charts. We
ﬁnd inhomogeneous generalizations of both broad and narrow parametric resonance. Our
results demonstrate that the transverse ﬂuctuations in φ can grow rapidly as a result of
collisions.
Ampliﬁcation can happen in several ways.
Radiative modes can be excited in the
collision region and then subsequently propagate into the bulk, which is the transverse gen-
eralization of the outgoing radiation seen in the (1+1)-d simulations above. However, these
excitations carry energy away from the collision and cannot experience sustained growth.
More interesting is the pumping of ﬂuctuations bound to the kinks (in cases where the walls
separate widely) or bound in the oscillating eﬀective mass well created by the late-time one-
dimensional oscillons. A similar eﬀect for fermionic degrees of freedom has been studied by
several authors [25–27], and for an additional ﬁeld coupled to φ in [28]. We only consider
ﬂuctuations in the ﬁeld φ itself, which is required in a consistent quantum treatment, and
we do not appeal to additional ﬁelds coupled to φ in order to obtain growing ﬂuctuations.
As well, unlike the authors of [28] we include the deformation of the spatial structure in V ′′
and couplings between the bound modes and radiative modes.
Although strictly true only for the case of the breathers, we approximate the oscillatory
evolution as periodic. Because of the periodicity, we can use Floquet theory to quantitatively
study instabilities in δφ. The resulting Floquet modes then provide a time-dependent normal
mode decomposition in which the evolution of the system is simple. The periodic approx-
imation is very accurate for the late-time bound states and excitations of the shape mode
in the planar background, so Floquet analysis is well justiﬁed for those two cases. When
the walls repeatedly bounce oﬀof each other, we show that the ampliﬁcation happens in
a very short time interval around the time of collision. The short bursts of growth in the
ﬂuctuations remain when the bouncing is not periodic, so again the Floquet analysis provides
an approximate account of the full evolution.
In early universe cosmology and nonequilibrium ﬁeld theory, Floquet analysis is familiar
from the theory of preheating [29–32]. For these problems the background is spatially ho-
mogeneous, which leads to two simpliﬁcations. First, the background evolution is described
by a nonlinear ODE instead of a nonlinear PDE, and analytic solutions are known in many
interesting cases [33–36]. Second, the equation for the ﬂuctuations is diagonalized by the 3D
Fourier transform. Therefore, instead of involving a large number of coupled oscillators the
problem reduces to a collection of decoupled oscillators with periodically changing masses
¨
δφk + (k2 + m2
eff(t))δφk = 0. The eﬀective mass squared m2
eff(t) = V ′′(φbg(t)) depends only
on time and k2 = k2
x + k2
y + k2
z is now the square of the full three-dimensional wavenumber.
Solutions to this equation have the well known form δφk(t) ∼P(t)eµt with the (possibly
complex) exponent µ known as a Floquet exponent. P(t) satisﬁes P(t + T) = P(t), where
T is the period of the oscillation in m2
eff. The µ’s depend parametrically on k as well as
the functional form of m2
eff.
Typically bands of stable (max[Re(µk)] = 0) and unstable
(max[Re(µk)] > 0) modes appear as we vary k while holding the form of m2
eff ﬁxed.2 There
are a variety of underlying mechanisms that can be responsible for the instability, such as

tachyonic resonance, narrow resonance and broad parametric resonance [30, 31, 35].
For a spatially dependent eﬀective mass, which is the case we consider, the form of the
decoupled solutions generalizes to δφ = F(x, t)eµt, where the proﬁle function F(x, t) satisﬁes
F(x, t + T) = F(x, t). This is easily seen by discretizing the x direction and placing the
system in a ﬁnite box. The equations of motion then take the form ˙v = M(t)v, with M(t)
a periodic matrix and v =

δ⃗φT , δ ˙⃗φT T
. Such equations fall within the domain of Floquet
theory and therefore solutions of the form given above are known to exist (modulo issues of
convergence on taking the continuum limit).
To treat the case of spatially inhomogeneous masses, we ﬁrst discretize the ﬁelds f
δφk⊥
on a lattice of N points labelled by index i. We denote the ﬁeld value at the ith lattice
site by φi and the corresponding ﬁeld by the vector δ⃗φ.
Next, we consider 2N linearly
independent solutions

δ⃗φ(j)(t), δ ˙⃗φ(j)(t)

to (3.3). Using this set of solutions, we form a
2Nx2N fundamental matrix solution F(t). For simplicity, we choose our initial conditions
such that the jth row of F(t) is given by the solution with initial condition
δφ(j)
i (0) =

for j > N ,
δ ˙φ(j)

(4.1)
Of course, we can construct our fundamental matrix from any complete set of initial states,
and we veriﬁed that choosing an orthonormal basis in Fourier space reproduced the re-
sults we present below. Finally, the Floquet exponents are related to the eigenvalues Λn
of F(0)−1F(T) via Λn = eµnT , with the initial conditions for the mode functions given by
F(0)e(n), where e(n) is an eigenvector of F(0)−1F(T) with corresponding eigenvalue Λn. For
each choice of k2
⊥and eﬀective mass there are 2N such exponents, but we focus on the
exponent with the largest real part (i.e. the largest Lyapunov exponent). For notational sim-
plicity we refer to this maximal real part of a Floquet exponent as µmax ≡max [Re(µ)]. This
method allows us to ﬁnd any exponentially growing instabilities given some ﬁxed background
evolution, but it is completely blind to other more slowly growing instabilities. In particular,
power law growth results when there are degenerate Floquet exponents, and we might expect
this to be common in the continuum limit given that we then have inﬁnitely many oscillators.
However we expect the exponentially growing modes to be the most important dynamically
and thus most interesting for our purposes. After all, we are ultimately interested in the
quantum problem where we must integrate over all possible modes.

sine-Gordon Potential
Using the planar symmetric sine-Gordon breather as the background circumvents the problem
of ﬁnding appropriate approximations to φbg. Furthermore, as bound states of a kink-antikink
pair, breathers resemble the states arising from collisions in the double-well and can be used
to gain some qualitative insight into the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations for the double-well as
well. The exact equation for linear ﬂuctuations around the breather is

max[Re(µk)] = 0.

The initial proﬁle of V ′′(x, t) for several representative choices of v can be found in the
right panel of ﬁgure 4, with the subsequent time evolution for these same three choices
in ﬁgure 5, ﬁgure 8 and ﬁgure 10.
The left panel of ﬁgure 4 is an instability chart in which µmaxTbreather appears as a
function of k2
⊥(1 + v2)/v2 as we vary v−1. There are several generic features of note. First,
µmax = 0 when k2
⊥= 0 for all values of the parameter v considered. Since the k⊥= 0 modes
are part of the planar symmetric system, this is a validation of our numerical procedure
since no exponentially growing modes exist in the sine-Gordon model in 1+1-dimension.3
For v−1 ≤1, V ′′(x, t) has the form of a single well whose depth oscillates with time. There
is a single instability band, the width and strength of which increases monotonically as v
decreases. Once v−1 > 1 the kink and antikink become less tightly bound and V ′′ develops
a pair of local minima separated by a small bump.
An additional instability band then
appears on the chart. As we continue to increase v−1 (decrease v), the kink and antikink
begin to separate from each other during the motion, and the two local minima in V ′′ develop
into two well separated wells as seen for v = 0.01 in the right panel of ﬁgure 4.
As we
continue to decrease v, additional instability bands appear.
Each of these bands grows
quickly with increasing v−1 and approaches a nearly constant width, although the strength
of the instability (per breather period) within each band continues to increase. However,
Tbreather is simultaneously increasing ∼v−1√
1 + v2 and this results in a decrease of the
maximal Floquet exponent if measured in units of t.

of minima, with the formation of two distinct wells when v ≪1 corresponding to the well-separated
kink and antikink.
We now study the properties of the mode functions for various regimes of v. This gives
us insight into the chart’s qualitative features and sheds light on the dynamical mechanism
3Of course, weaker non-exponential instabilities or transient instabilities are still allowed. For example, for
a given v we could add a perturbation such that the new ﬁeld conﬁguration corresponds to a breather with
˜v ̸= v. Since the period of the breather depends on v, the perturbation δφ = φbreather,˜v −φbreather,v will grow
initially but will not experience unchecked exponential growth.

responsible for the ampliﬁcation.
4.1.1
v ≪1 : Broad Parametric Resonance
First we consider the v ≪1 limit. The breather is eﬀectively a weakly bound kink-antikink
pair which repeatedly approach and pass through each other. The resulting evolution of V ′′
is illustrated in the left panel of ﬁgure 5 for the speciﬁc case of v = 0.01. Due to the reﬂection
symmetry of the potential about any of its minima, the period TV ′′ = π
√
1 + v2/v of the
eﬀective mass is half the period Tbreather = 2π
√
1 + v2/v of the breather. For most of the
evolution, V ′′ has two distinct wells corresponding to the individual kink and antikink. In the
1d ﬁeld theory, each of these wells has a zero mode (the translation mode) associated with it.
When we allow for the transverse ﬂuctuations, the zero mode leads to a continuum of bound
excited states with dispersion relation ωbound = k⊥> 0. As the breather evolves, the two wells
in V ′′ periodically come together and “annihilate” each other as seen in the top left panel
of ﬁgure 5. During these brief moments when the two wells have disappeared, the bound
states cease to be approximate eigenstates of the system. The temporary annihilation of the
wells allows for the rapid ampliﬁcation of bound ﬂuctuations. Whether or not a particular k⊥
receives coherent contributions to its amplitude at successive annihilations depends on the
phase ωboundTV ′′ ∼k⊥
√
1 + v2/v accumulated between collisions. In the stability chart this
dependence on the accumulated phase manifests as the repeating structure in k2
⊥(1 + v2)/v2.
Of course, this process is very similar to the familiar case of broad parametric resonance [31],
in which short but large violations of adiabaticity (| ˙Ω/Ω2| ≳1) of a harmonic oscillator
with a time-dependent frequency Ω(t) lead to bursts of bound state “particle production”
in the Bogoliubov sense. For the familiar homogeneous case the nonadiabaticity is captured
by a time-dependent frequency alone, while for the inhomogeneous background we have the
additional eﬀect of a strong deformation of the spatial properties of the eﬀective mass.
To illustrate the broad resonance process with a speciﬁc example, we plot various aspects
of the fastest growing transverse Floquet mode for a breather with v = 0.01 and k2
⊥= 0.05
in ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6. As evident in the bottom panel of ﬁgure 5 the mode function is
strongly peaked around the locations of the kink and antikink.
The mode function also
experiences large jumps around each collision, exactly as expected from our discussion in
the previous paragraph. To further illustrate the rapid ampliﬁcation of bound ﬂuctuations
by the collisions, the left panel of ﬁgure 6 shows the value of δφ at the leftmost instaneous
minimum of V ′′ as a function of time, along with the value V ′′
min at this minimum. During
the collision, V ′′
min rapidly changes from −1 to 1 and δφ experiences a nearly instantaneous
increase in its amplitude.
To quantify the growth of ﬂuctuations, it is useful to introduce the eﬀective particle

which (modulo overall normalization and contributions from the bulk) gives the occupation
number of massless transverse ﬂuctuations bound to either the kink or antikink. For a bound
ﬂuctuation on an isolated kink with transverse wavenumber k⊥this quantity is constant.
Therefore, we can use it to track the growth of ﬂuctuations so changes.
From the right
panel of ﬁgure 6, we see that between collisions nωbound
eff
is constant and undergoes nearly
discontinuous jumps during the short collisions between the kink and antikink.
This analysis conﬁrms our intuitive expectation that the exponential growth results from
the production of bound state ﬂuctuations. However, several additional questions remain

that we now address. First, since the mode function is symmetric about the origin it cannot
distinguish between the following processes: simultaneous ampliﬁcation of the bound states
on both the kink and antikink, ampliﬁcation of modes bound to the kink (or antikink) only,
and growth of ﬂuctuations in only the left (or right) well.4 Second, it is unclear whether
the stability bands arise primarily from dissipation of ﬂuctuations into the bulk, or primarily
from phase interference between bound ﬂuctuations. Finally, a somewhat surprising feature
of the the mode function is the long radiative tail that extends far from the spatially localized
breather into the bulk.
4Actually, we can distinguish the ﬁrst case from the other two by looking at the second largest eigenvalue.
If pumping only occurred on one kink at a time, then the appropriate linear combinations of only pumping
on the kink or only pumping on the antikink would result in two nearly degenerate Floquet exponents. For
the sine-Gordon model we have found that within the instability bands the second largest Floquet exponent
is always much smaller than the largest one.

Figure 6. For the sine-Gordon model, we illustrate the growth of bound state ﬂuctuations around a
v = 0.01 breather with k2
⊥= 0.05. Left: Mode function evaluated at the instantaneous location of the
leftmost kink, deﬁned as the leftmost minimum of V ′′. For reference we also include the value of V ′′
at the minimum. Right: The occupation number of bound state ﬂuctuations as measured by (4.3).
Since we use unnormalized mode functions, we don’t have neff = 0 initially.
To gain insight into these issues, we consider ﬂuctuations with the initial condition
δφinit = sech(x + xK) with xK = −
√
1 + v2 log(v/2). This initial condition corresponds to a
bound state ﬂuctuation on the leftmost kink (or antikink) of the breather solution. Figure 7
shows the evolution of this initial state for several choices of k2
⊥. For each run, we show the
evolution of nωbound
eff
deﬁned in (4.3). Since our setup is no longer symmetric about the origin,
we also plot the fractional contributions,
nleft
eff
neff and
nright
eff
neff , to the integral from only the left
half and right half of the domain respectively. For k2
⊥= 0.83, a large amount of radiation is
produced in the collisions, so we calculated neff restricted to the interval |x| < 25 in order to
isolate the bound part of the ﬂuctuations. The simulation itself had an integration domain of
length L ≈1174. To illustrate the growth of the bound ﬂuctuations, we plot δφwall evaluated
at the instantaneous left and right minima of V ′′.5 Finally, we show the proﬁle of δ ˙φ2 + δφ2
at several times around the ﬁrst collision of the kink and antikink. This is a useful indication
of the growth of ﬂuctuations and in light of (4.3) can be interpreted as a local “particle
density”.
In each collision some radiation is released from the collision region. As k⊥is increased
the ﬂuctuations appear to be less tightly bound to the kink, and the amplitude of radiation
produced in the collisions tends to be larger.
This is likely the origin of the decreasing
amplitude of µmax at the centre of the instability bands as we increase k⊥while holding v
constant. Incidentally, the emitted radiation clariﬁes the origin of the long radiative tail we
found for the mode function in ﬁgure 5. Whether or not the mode functions grow, at each
collision some radiation is emitted from the collision region. Consider a pair of subsequent
collisions for the case when the mode function is growing exponentially. Just prior to both
collisions, the phase of the mode function will be the either the same (or diﬀer by π) while
the amplitude diﬀers by eµTV ′′. These properties follow from the form P(x, t)eµt of the mode
function and the step-like nature of the increase in the amplitude. For simplicity, consider
5The locations at which V ′′ obtains its minimum value is a useful deﬁnition of the instantaneous location
of the kink and antikink.
– 15 –

the case when the phases are the same.6 Since the ﬂuctuations obey a linear equation, the
radiation emitted in the second collision is identical to that in the ﬁrst collision, except it has a
larger amplitude by a factor eµTV ′′. Therefore, trains of radiation with the same spatial proﬁle
but step-like behaviour in their amplitude will be emitted from the collision. Figure 7 also
suggests that whether or not a particular value of k⊥will experience an exponential instability
is primarily determined by the phase interference between the bound state ﬂuctuations. This
can occur either because the ﬂuctuations are not excited in any of the collisions (as in the
case k2
⊥= 4.006x10−4), or because the ﬂuctuations are excited in one collision but then
de-excited due to phase interference in the subsequent collision (as in the case k2
⊥= 0.83).
Finally, as expected from studying the second largest Floquet exponent (see footnote 4), we
see that for the unstable modes the excitation tends to occur on both the kink and antikink
simultaneously. On the other hand, when the modes are drawn from a stability band the
ﬂuctuations on the kink and antikink no longer experience the same degree of excitation or
de-excitation at each collision.
4.1.2
v ≥1 : Narrow Parametric Resonance
We now turn to the case of larger v’s, where we no longer have a well-deﬁned kink and
antikink at any point in the breather’s motion. We ﬁrst consider v = 1 and k2
⊥= 0.35,
which is located near the centre of the instability band. For this choice of v, the middle of
the breather just makes it to a maximum of the potential every half oscillation. Therefore,
V ′′(x, t) has the form of a single oscillating well whose middle oscillates between −1 and
1 and asymptotes to 1 at ±∞, as illustrated in the top left panel of ﬁgure 8. The kink
and antikink are tightly bound so they never have separate identities. Therefore, the notion
of particles bound to the kink and particles bound to the antikink is ill-deﬁned, and our
previous intuition based on the creation of ﬂuctuations bound to the individual kink and
antikink no longer applies. Instead, we expect the pumping to occur more smoothly and be
localized in the region of the breather. As seen in the bottom panel of ﬁgure 8, this is indeed
the case. The mode function looks like a smoothly oscillating function with exponentially
growing amplitude. As well, the mode function satisﬁes δφ(x, t + TV ′′) = −δφ(x, t)eµTV ′′, so
the period of the oscillation is the period of the breather not the period of the eﬀective mass.
One way to see the smooth exponential growth is to consider the quantity

n(ωbreather)

is an eﬀective particle number, like (4.3) for the v ≪1 breathers, but modiﬁed
to account for the fact that in this case the oscillation frequency of the breather dominates
the oscillation frequency of the mode function. The top right panel of ﬁgure 8 demonstrates
the smooth exponential growth of n(ωbreather)
eff
with some small subleading oscillations. The
periodic part of the Floquet modes can be decomposed into an harmonic expansion domi-
nated by the frequency of the breather, with smaller subleading contributions from higher

6For the case when the mode function picks up a phase factor of π between consecutive collisions, we can
instead consider three consecutive collisions. The phase prior to the ﬁrst and third collisions is then the same
and the argument goes through as in the main text.

concentrated at the location of the well created by the breather. Once we move away from
the breather, the spatial phase in each frequency varies linearly.
This linear variation is
consistent with the production of radiation in the breather which then travels oﬀto inﬁnity.
Finally, we consider the case v =
1
√
2−1 and k2
⊥= 0.2. As in the case v = 1, there
is a single oscillating well in V ′′. However, the maximum excursion of the ﬁeld is ±π
2 , so
the eﬀective mass for the ﬂuctuations is positive semideﬁnite. This is illustrated in the top
left panel of ﬁgure 10. The remaining panels of ﬁgure 10 show that the resulting fastest
growing Floquet mode is qualitatively similar to the v = 1 case. There is an isolated blob
that oscillates with a frequency determined by ωbreather whose amplitude grows smoothly
as an exponential.
Looking at the frequency content in ﬁgure 11, we see that the mode
function again consists of a large amplitude part concentrated in the potential well of the
breather and a smaller amplitude radiative tail propagating away from the breather. The
oscillation frequencies in the two regions are more monochromatic than in the v = 1 cases.
The dominant frequency of the radiative part diﬀers from the dominant frequency of the
bound part. In both the v = 1 and v =

Symmetric Double Well
We now consider the symmetric double-well. As demonstrated in ﬁgure 3, for certain choices
of the initial kink speed the background solutions can undergo oscillatory motion. For the
case of the asymmetric well, the oscillatory motion is generic due to the attractive force
experienced by a well separated K ¯K pair. We will not consider the asymmetric well explicitly,
but the behaviour of the ﬂuctuations is qualitatively the same as for the symmetric well.
For the double-well, oscillatory motion of the background solution comes in three forms:
repeated collisions of the walls, oscillations of the internal planar shape mode, and evolution
of a late-time planar oscillon. The ﬁrst of these is analogous to the sine-Gordon breathers
with v ≪1, while the last is qualitatively similar to the breathers with v ≥1. For the
repeated collisions and late-time oscillons, the only new feature is that we have V ′′(x =
0) > V ′′(x = ∞) for part of the evolution. The oscillations of the planar shape mode are a
new feature not present in the sine-Gordon model. We will study each of these background
motions independently, although there are several caveats to this approach. First of all, the
repeated collisions and shape mode oscillations typically occur together in actual background
solutions. In the homogeneous case, the stability chart for a harmonic oscillator with eﬀective
mass containing multiple frequencies is not the same as a superposition of the stability charts

for each individual frequency [37]. Despite this, from the sine-Gordon analysis above we
know that the growth of ﬂuctuations due to the collision will occur in a very short time
interval during the actual collision. The collision also excites the (planar) shape mode in the
background, which is then free to pump excitations during the much longer intervals while the
walls separate from each other. Since the two ampliﬁcation eﬀects are temporally separated,
we can gain good qualitative understanding by considering the processes in isolation. The
resulting interference from the two mechanisms could then be done using projections on the
appropriate Floquet basis (either for the wall collisions or the shape oscillations) just before
and after each collision. Of course, since the exact background is not exactly periodic, the
interference eﬀects will tend to get smeared out leading to a smoothing of the instability
diagram.
This smoothing is analogous to what happens in the homogeneous case when
expansion of the universe is included.

Bouncing of the Walls : Broad Parametric Resonance
Keeping the above caveats in mind, we begin with the case where the K ¯K pair separate
widely from each other between collisions.
Unlike the sine-Gordon breather, we have no
analytic solutions for this case. Also, due to the emission of radiation and the excitation of
the shape mode, the background motion is no longer periodic. In order to create a periodic

alternative approach would have been to simply insert a periodic function for r(t) and study
the resulting ﬂuctuation behaviour. However, (4.7) is better justiﬁed than a completely ad
hoc choice for r(t) because it partially incorporates the full ﬁeld dynamics.7
7As a check, we did insert several other parameterized choices for r(t) “by hand” and found banding
structure as we varied the parameters.

µmaxTwalls, while in the right we show the second largest µmax,2Twalls. Unlike the sine-Gordon model,
here we have regions where there are two unstable modes rather than just one. We see the expected
banding structure with bands evenly spaced in k⊥Twalls.
Figure 12 shows the resulting Floquet exponents for several choices of rmax. As expected,
the bands are distributed evenly in the phase accumulated between subsequent collisions by
bound ﬂuctuations, k⊥Twalls. There is a very strong instability as k⊥→0, which is not
unexpected given that our approximation ignores the radiation and planar shape mode that
are excited during the collisions. One interesting new feature is the presence of a second
growing mode, which we illustrate by plotting the second largest real part of a Floquet
exponent in addition to the largest one.
4.2.2
Planar Shape Mode Oscillations : Narrow Parametric Resonance
Next consider the pumping of ﬂuctuations by oscillations of the planar shape mode. This
is a new eﬀect that is not present in the sine-Gordon model. Since the planar shape mode
is generically excited (or de-excited) during collisions, this source ampliﬁcation can occur
in conjunction with the nonadiabatic production of ﬂuctuations due to the colliding walls
described in the previous paragraph. We parameterize the background motion as
φbg = tanh (ξ) + Ashape cos(ω1t) sinh(ξ)
cosh2(ξ),
(4.8)
where ξ ≡m(x −x0)
√

and ω2

(4.9)
As in the case of the repeated collisions described above, (4.9) is not an exact solution of the
1D ﬁeld equations. Nonlinear couplings in the potential will modify the oscillation frequency
of the shape mode and also cause it to radiate. Hence the amplitude will gradually decrease
in time, leading to a slowly changing oscillation frequency. It is even possible to tune the
amplitude so that the subsequent evolution leads to the creation of a kink-antikink pair in
addition to the kink that was initially present [24]. However, provided the amplitude is not
too large, the time-varying amplitude and frequency can be approximated as an adiabatic
tracing of modes on the instability chart. Hence the chart and corresponding mode functions
are a good approximation to the ﬂuctuations in the true background.

for Ashape = 0.5. As expected from the interpretation of the shape mode as a perturbation
to the width of the kink, V ′′ looks like a well whose width oscillates in time.
There is
also some additional oscillating side-lobe structure. The remaining panels in ﬁgure 14 show
the fastest growing Floquet mode, the eﬀective particle number, and the various frequency
components of the solution. These plots are analogous to those for the v ≥1 breathers
in ﬁgure 8, ﬁgure 9, ﬁgure 10 and ﬁgure 11. Because the mode function completes only half
an oscillation per period of the shape mode, the frequency used in the deﬁnition of nω
eff is
ω = π/Tshape. The mode function displays more structure than sine-Gordon breather mode
functions, in particular in the higher harmonics. This additional structure is probably due
to the additional sidelobe structure of V ′′. However, the solution is still well described by
a single oscillation frequency near the core of the kink, with additional harmonics becoming
important as we move into the oscillating sidelobes and then into the radiating regime.

1D Oscillon Background : Narrow Parametric Resonance
Consider ﬂuctuations around the late-time (1-dimensional) oscillon state. In order to approx-
imate the background motion, we ﬁrst expand the solution about the true vacuum minimum

breathers.

In ﬁgure 15 we show stability charts for the fastest growing mode around the oscillon back-
ground (4.11). We plot the charts for both the leading order and second-order in ϵ approx-
imations to the background.8 The detailed structure of the instability does display some
sensitivity to our choice of approximation for the background. For k⊥= 0 and ϵ ≲0.2,
the higher order approximation removes a weak instability that was present in the leading
order approximation, indicating that it is indeed a better approximation to the background
at small ϵ.
However, for larger ϵ the higher-order background is actually more unstable
than the leading order approximation. This is merely a reminder that our approximation is
asymptotic rather than convergent. When we consider k⊥̸= 0, we see that the additional
oscillating frequencies in the second-order background lead to several weak instability bands
at small ϵ. For larger ϵ the main instability band extends for a wider range of k⊥and has
larger Floquet exponents. This is not surprising since the oscillation amplitude is larger in
this approximation and we would thus expect it to drive stronger instabilities.
4.3
Comments on Collisions of other Membrane-like Objects
Although we focussed on two speciﬁc scalar ﬁeld models, the dynamical mechanism that leads
to rapid growth of the ﬂuctuations is much more general. In particular, for well-separated
walls the explosive growth of ﬂuctuations relied only on the presence of bound ﬂuctuations
around each of the kinks and violation of adiabaticity for these bound states. Recall that
these ﬂuctuations are the transverse generalization of the Goldstone mode (i.e. the translation
mode) resulting from the spontaneous breaking of translation invariance by the kink in the
one-dimensional theory. An equivalent Goldstone mode will occur for kinks in any translation
invariant theory, and thus these bound ﬂuctuations are ubiquitous. For kink-antikink type
collisions such as those studied here, we typically expect large deformations in the shape of
V ′′ during each collision. Therefore, the parametric ampliﬁcation of wall-bound ﬂuctuations
we have found here should be very common. We leave for future work the interesting question
8The particular choice of oscillon proﬁle is not essential. We also ran simulations using Gaussian proﬁles
φbg = A cos(ωt)e−x2/w2 for various choices of ω and w taking A as a parameter. In this case we also found
similar banding structure for the Floquet chart.

of kink-kink collisions, where the eﬀective potential wells resulting from each of the kinks do
not completely annihilate during collision.
Our results also have relevance to collisions of other membrane-like objects such as D-
branes. When the kink and antikink are well separated, the transverse translation modes
are characterized by a spatially dependent location for the centre of the kink, and are thus
well-described by an eﬀective action for a membrane. If two such membranes are in close
proximity to each other, it is natural to expect them to interact. For the case of D-branes,
this interaction is usually described in terms of the excitation and production of string modes.
Since string production is a local process from the viewpoint of a ﬁeld theory on the brane, we
expect that the resulting ﬂuctuations will be inhomogeneous and analogous to the excitation
of our transverse modes. We show in [13] and [14] that the inhomogeneity of the growing
ﬂuctuations dramatically changes the full three-dimensional dynamics compared to the planar
approximation. The detailed eﬀects of the onset of nonlinearities amongst the ﬂuctuations
is dependent on the details of the high-energy theory (in our case a scalar ﬁeld theory).
However, the linear dynamics described in this paper should be much less sensitive to the UV
completion and we expect D-brane collisions to also result in the rapid growth of “transverse”
ﬂuctuations that eventually require a full nonlinear higher-dimensional treatment.

Comments on Fluctuations Around Colliding Bubbles
Beginning with the work of Hawking, Moss and Stewart [12], the two-bubble collision prob-
lem has been explored by many authors [40–48]. A common feature of these analyses is the
assumption of SO(2,1) symmetry for the ﬁeld proﬁles. This is motivated by the SO(4) sym-
metry of the minimum action bounce solution for a single bubble [18], which translates into
an SO(3,1) symmetry for the nucleation and subsequent expansion of the bubble in real time.
The nucleation of a second bubble destroys the boost symmetry along the axis connecting
their centres, leaving a residual SO(2,1) symmetry for the 2-bubble solution, making of the
problem eﬀectively 1 + 1-dimensional, which greatly eases the numerical challenges and has
even led to a general relativistic treatment [49–51].
However this is not the full story. Quantum ﬂuctuations are present, in fact are re-
sponsible for the bubble nucleation in the ﬁrst place. We now discuss the linear ﬂuctuation
dynamics in the background of the pair of colliding bubbles. For a discussion of perturba-
– 26 –

tions around a single bubble see [52–54]. Results for the fully nonlinear three-dimensional
dynamics of bubble collisions are presented in [14].

Background Dynamics of Highly Symmetric Collisions
As in the planar wall case, we decompose the ﬁeld into a symmetric background component
and a nonsymmetric ﬂuctuation. A convenient variable change is
t = s cosh χ
x = x
(5.1)
y = s sinh χ cos θ
z = s sinh χ sin θ ,
aligned so the centres of the two bubbles both lie on the x-axis. The SO(2,1) symmetry
is now manifest, as the background depending only on s and x. We separate the ﬁeld into
a symmetric background and symmetry breaking ﬂuctuations φ = φbg(s, x) + δφ(s, x, χ, θ).

verse wavenumber squared ℓ2 as s−2, and modifying the dynamics of φbg and by extension

As in the case of the kink-antikink collisions, the bubble walls undergo multiple collisions, each
time opening up a pocket where the ﬁeld is localized near the false vacuum minimum. The
bouncing behaviour we observe is characteristic of bubble collisions in double-well potentials
with mildly broken Z2 symmetry, and was ﬁrst noted by Hawking, Moss and Stewart [12].
Considering the implications of this behaviour for the full 3 + 1-dimensional evolution
suggests that two instabilities may occur. The ﬁrst is the generalization of our previous results
to the SO(2,1) symmetric rather than the planar symmetric case. Given the background
evolution depicted in ﬁgure 16, we see that (5.3) again describes a ﬁeld with an oscillating

The color coding indicates the value of the scalar ﬁeld. Blue indicates it is near the true vacuum
minimum, red shows regions where it is near the false vacuum, and the location of the bubble wall is

time- and space-dependent mass. Figure 16 also reveals the presence of another possible
instability.
Because of the SO(2,1) symmetry, each pocket with the ﬁeld near the false
vacuum corresponds to a torus with growing radius centred on the initial collision in the full
3-dimensional evolution. Roughly, we can think of this as a torus of false vacuum with a
thin membrane separating it from the true vacuum on the outside. The energy diﬀerence
between the false and true vacuum leads to a pressure acting normal to the local surface
of the membrane. Since this pressure wants to push the membrane into the false vacuum,
this will tend to cause small initial ripples on the surface of the torus to grow. The surface
tension of the membrane and the stretching of the torus as it expands tend to counteract
this eﬀect, so that a three-dimensional calculation is required to determine the ultimate fate
of these ripples. As we will see in [14], both of these instabilities manifest themselves in the
fully 3+1-dimensional problem.

Conclusions
We studied the dynamics of linear asymmetric ﬂuctuations around highly symmetric collisions
between planar domain walls and vacuum bubbles.
Parallel planar walls are a common
ingredient in cosmological braneworld model building, and SO(2,1) bubble collisions are
generally believed to be an accurate description of individual bubble collisions during false
vacuum decay. The results shown here have implications for such cosmological scenarios, as
well as being of intrinsic theoretical interest.
Fluctuations are generically present in the ﬁeld that forms the domain wall and therefore
must be included in a quantum treatment of the problem. However, nearly all past studies
of planar wall and vacuum bubble collisions dynamics have used symmetry to reduce the
problem to a 1+1-dimensional PDE, thus excluding the ﬂuctuations a priori.
Assessing
the validity of this drastic reduction in the eﬀective number of dimensions requires a more
sophisticated treatment of the problem, and this paper provides such a treatment.

Once we have ﬁxed the symmetric background dynamics for the collision, the ﬂuctua-
tions behave as a free scalar ﬁeld with a time- and space-dependent eﬀective frequency. Using
Floquet theory and extending well-developed methods for ODEs to PDEs, we were able to
show that the time-dependence of the eﬀective frequency can lead to exponential growth of
the symmetry breaking ﬂuctuations. We also studied the spatial structure of the ampliﬁed
modes to obtain an understanding of the mechanism responsible for the ampliﬁcation. We
found generalizations of both broad parametric resonance and narrow parametric resonance.
Due to the spatial dependence of the eﬀective frequency the ampliﬁed modes are localized
along the collision direction. For collisions between well deﬁned wall-antiwall pairs, the re-
sulting ampliﬁcation can be interpreted as Bogoliubov production of particles bound to the
walls, i.e., of longitudinally localized modes. The evolution of the eﬀective occupation num-
ber shows they are created in bursts when there are well-deﬁned collisions in the background.
Once nonlinearity onsets, the strong coupling of the transverse to the longitudinal degrees of
freedom breaks this localized particle description. Numerical lattice solutions are needed to
describe the subsequent evolution.
Our detailed study of the unstable modes reveals that the dynamical mechanism respon-
sible for the rapid growth of ﬂuctuations is much more general than our two scalar single-ﬁeld
model examples. In particular, for collisions between a pair of well deﬁned walls, the most
strongly ampliﬁed modes are the transverse generalizations of the Goldstone mode resulting
from the spontaneous breaking of translation invariance by the domain wall in the symmetry
reduced one-dimensional theory. These modes are present on any membrane-like object in
a translation invariant theory. The ampliﬁcation only relied on a strong deformation of the
eﬀective potential binding these ﬂuctuations to the wall. Such deformations will be extremely
common in domain walls formed in scalar ﬁeld theories, and should also arise in collisions
between other membrane-like objects such as D-branes. Therefore, we expect qualitatively
similar results to be obtained in a wide variety of collisions involving membrane-like objects.
The linearized approach taken here cannot tell us what the ultimate fate of the expo-
nentially growing modes will be. Since the modes have k⊥̸= 0, they do not respect the
planar symmetry of the background. This suggests that this symmetry will be badly broken
once the ﬂuctuations become large. The treatment of the fully nonlinear ﬁeld evolution is
the subject of two companion papers [13] and [14]. We will explore nearly planar symmetric
domain wall and nearly SO(2,1) symmetric bubble collisions using high resolution massively
parallel scalar ﬁeld lattice simulations. These investigations will demonstrate that the non-
linear evolution leads to a complete breakdown of the original symmetry of the background,
including a dissolution of the walls and production of a population of oscillons in the collision
region. This entire process is unique to more than one spatial dimension and is a completely
new eﬀect that has not previously been considered in either domain wall or bubble collisions.

Collective Coordinate Approximation for Double Well Collisions
We present a brief derivation of our collective coordinate approximation for the repeated
collisions of two walls. The key step is to drastically reduce the number of degrees of freedom

This ansatz ignores production of radiation, excitations of the shape mode, and distortion
of the kinks due to their mutual interaction. However, as emphasized in the main text, we
wish to separate out the eﬀects of the actual collision from the subsequent evolution and
approximation (A.1) does this.
Our goal is to obtain an eﬀective Lagrangian for the locations, r, of the kink and
antikink.
This should be of the form for a pair of relativistic point particles interacting
through a potential, along with corrections induced by the ﬁnite thickness of the kinks. For
simplicity, we assume ˙γ = 0. Terms involving ˙γ arise only from the kinetic term for the ﬁelds,
and we are dropping a ﬁnite thickness correction by ignoring them. Substituting (A.1) into
the Lagrangian for the ﬁeld, we ﬁnd

Note that the interactions between the kink and antikink depend on their relative speeds as
well as on their separations. This is because these interactions are generated by integrals
of the overlap between the kink and antikink. As their speeds increase, the kinks Lorentz
contract which changes the amount of overlap. When the kink and antikink are far apart
this overlap is exponentially small. Therefore, we make an additional approximation: when
performing the integrals we keep overall γ multipliers only on the terms with no r dependence.

Comparison of the analytic approximation for the evolution of r(t) with numerical
simulation of the eﬀective equations for the background. The solid lines are the analytic approx-
imation (A.11) and the triangles are a numerical solution to the equations of motion for the La-
grangian (A.5). Thus it is very accurate apart from a small lengthening of the period in the full
solution. The accuracy improves as we increase the initial separation.
Energy conservation implies a minimum value for r, but this equation allows r →−∞. We

which enforces the condition r(T/2) = rmin where Veff(rmin) = Veff(rmax) and rmin < 0.
In ﬁgure 18 we compare the accuracy of this analytic approximation to a full solution of the
equations for the Lagrangian (A.5). We have approximated γ = 1 in K(r) and Veff(r) but
have otherwise included both the noncanonical kinetic correction and relativistic corrections.
Our approximation (A.11) is very accurate for most of the evolution.
The above procedure can be generalized to the asymmetric well. However, the main
eﬀect of setting δ ̸= 0 is to break the Z2 symmetry so that the two potential minima are no
longer degenerate. This introduces a contribution to the eﬀective potential of form [V (φf) −
V (φt)]r for ωr ≫1, which induces a constant force driving the wall and antiwall towards
each other.

Numerical Approach and Convergence Tests
In this appendix we summarize the numerical techniques used in this paper.
For time-
evolution in our codes, diﬀerent schemes were used for the nonlinear background (3.2) and
the linear ﬂuctuations (3.3). For the one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation (3.2), we used
a 10th order accurate Gauss-Legendre quadrature based method. This is a speciﬁc choice of
an implicit Runge-Kutta process. Given an initial condition yt to dy/dt = H(y) at time t,

the solution at time t + dt is obtained by solving

The ci’s are the roots of Pν(2c −1) where Pν(x) is the Legendre polynomial of degree ν.
These relations arise by approximating the time-evolution integrals using Gauss-Legendre
quadrature. Because of the excellent convergence properties of quadrature approximations,
the result is an order 2ν integrator.9 Explicit formulae for ν up to 5 are given in Table 2 of
Butcher [55], but it is easier in practice to simply solve (B.3) numerically.
For the linear ﬂuctuation equation (3.3), we employ Yoshida’s [56] operator-splitting
technique that was introduced into the preheating community by Frolov and Huang. For fur-
ther details see, for example, [56–58]. For this set of integrators, the solution to df/dt = H(f)
is ﬁrst written as f(t+dt) = eHdtf(t), where H should now be interpreted as an operator act-
ing on f. We decompose H = P
i Hi so the action of each individual Hi on f is simple to com-
pute accurately. Finally, we re-express the time evolution operator U ≡eHdt as a product of
exponentials for the individual Hi operators, eHdt = U(wM)U(wM−1) . . . U(w0)U(w1) . . . U(wM)+
O(dtn+1), where U(wi) ≡ewiH1dt/2ewiH2dtewiH1dt/2 is a second-order accurate time-evolution
operator for time-step widt and we have specialized to the case of an operator split into only
two parts for simplicity. Via clever choices of the number and value of the numerical coef-
ﬁcients wi, integrators of various orders n may be constructed. For this paper, we use an
O(dt6) method with coeﬃcients wi given by
w1 = −1.17767998417887100694641568096431573
w2 = 0.235573213359358133684793182978534602
w3 = 0.784513610477557263819497633866349876
w0 = 1 −2(w1 + w2 + w3) = 1.31518632068391121888424972823886251 .
(B.4)
The Gauss-Legendre and Yoshida approaches are both symplectic integrators for Hamil-
tonian systems. Therefore we ﬁnd it convenient to use Hamilton’s form for the evolution
equations. With the exception of the collective coordinate location for the bouncing walls in
the double well, all of the Hamiltonians used in this paper can be split into two exactly solv-
able pieces so that H = H1 + H2. For reference, we provide these splits below, even though
9Here we take the order of the integrator (denoted by n) to be the highest power in dt for which the
approximate solution is exact. This means the leading order error term is ∼dtn+1.

In all three cases, πf,i represents the canonical momentum for ﬁeld f at lattice site i. The
operator G[φi] is a discrete approximation to (∂xφ(xi))2.
We now describe the spatial discretization of the system. For all production runs we
used a Fourier pseudospectral approximation for the ﬁeld derivatives. The only derivative ap-
pearing in the various equations of motion is the one-dimensional Laplacian along the collision
axis ∂xx. Therefore, in practice the system was evolved in real space, with the Laplacian eval-
uated in Fourier space through the use of the FFT. Although the resulting FFT and inverse
FFT are numerically more expensive than a ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation, the continuum
limit is approached much more rapidly as seen in ﬁgure 20. This is especially important when
computing Floquet exponents, as our approach requires solving 2N individual PDE’s in order
to form the fundamental matrix where N is the number of grid points. As well, in order to
maintain a ﬁxed accuracy in the time-integration, the ratio dx/dt should be kept constant
meaning that the total work required scales as N3 for a ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation and
N3 log(N) for a pseudospectral approach.10 Since the pseudospectral calculations converge
using much fewer lattice sites than the ﬁnite-diﬀerence stencils, the pseudospectral approach
ends up requiring less CPU time yet is (orders of magnitude) more accurate.
To provide independent veriﬁcation of our results, we also performed several runs us-
ing ﬁnite-diﬀerence discretizations of G[φi]. The Hamiltonian was discretized directly, thus
ensuring a consistent discretization of ∇2φ and (∇φ)2. We tested with both second-order

ﬂoating point operations. However, for the problems we were concerned with the spectral approach proved to
be much faster if an accuracy better than the tenth of a percent level was desired.

Convergence Tests
The combination of high-order time-integrations and spectrally accurate derivative approx-
imations leads to a rapid convergence of both the nonlinear ﬁeld evolution used to study
the background dynamics and the Floquet exponents obtained by solving the perturbation
equations.
Several measures of convergence are shown in ﬁgure 19 for the nonlinear wave equation
with initial conditions as in the bottom right panel of ﬁgure 3. In the top row we show the
pointwise convergence of the solution as we vary the number of grid points N (or equiva-
lently the grid spacing) and the time-step dt, thus independently testing our Fourier spatial
discretization and our Gauss-Legendre integrator. We consider two closely related measures,
∥∆φ(p)∥L1 ≡N−1
base
X
{xi}
|φ(p+1)(xi) −φ(p)(xi)|
∥∆φ(p)∥max ≡max
{xi} |φ(p+1)(xi) −φ(p)
i (xi)|
(B.12)
where φ(p) denotes the numerical solution for the pth approximation (here either the number
of grid points or the time step), and we take N(p+1)/N(p) = 2 = dt(p)/dt(p+1). To compare
solutions with diﬀerent spatial resolutions, we took all sums over the grid from the N = 2048
simulation. The top left panel, shows that the solution rapidly converges (to the level of
machine precision) as we increase the spatial resolution, exactly as we expect for a properly
resolved pseudospectral code. The top right panel shows that the growing error at late times
is due to errors in the time-stepping rather than in the spatial discretization. This is not
really a time-stepping issue, but a demonstration that making a pointwise comparison of
the ﬁelds is not necessarily the best measure of convergence. In particular, the errors that
accumulate at late time occur because we have an oscillating localized blob of ﬁeld. Small
errors in the oscillation frequency then lead to errors in the instantaneous value of the ﬁeld.
These errors manifest themselves as accumulating changes in the pointwise diﬀerences at
late times. As a further test of our time evolution we check the conservation of the energy
density ρ = ⟨T 00⟩= ⟨
˙φ2
2 + (∇φ)2

+ V (φ)⟩and ﬁeld momentum P x = ⟨T 0x⟩= −˙φ∂xφ for a
range of time steps dt. T µν is the energy-momentum tensor of φ and ⟨·⟩denotes a spatial
average. For all choices of time step, the ﬁeld momentum is conserved to machine precision,
while for dt ≤dx/5 the energy is also conserved to machine precision.
To understand the accuracy of our Floquet exponents, and to demonstrate the great
gains in accuracy obtained via a pseudospectral approach relative to a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme,
we show convergence plots for the maximal Floquet exponent in ﬁgure 20. Here we can di-
rectly compare the individual Floquet exponents, so we plot

1/30, mL = 1024 and various choices of grid spacing dx and time step dt. We plot the two norms
deﬁned in (B.12). The accumulating errors at late times are due to small errors in the oscillation
frequency and initial phase of the oscillon that has formed at the origin. Decreasing the time step
below dx/5 does not lead to a decrease in this error, suggesting that it arises due to machine roundoﬀ.
In the bottom row we demonstrate the convergence of both energy (bottom left) and momentum
(bottom right) of the system for the same choices of dt as in the top right plot. Since both (conserved)
quantities are constant to very high accuracy, this demonstrates that our time-stepping has converged.
left panel for various numerical schemes. The top right panel shows the convergence rate as
the time-step is varied. As expected for a sixth-order accurate integrator, the error decreases
rapidly, although not quite as quickly as for the Gauss-Legendre integrator. Also of note
is that the error decreases uniformly for all values of k⊥(except for those values that are
already at machine roundoﬀlevels) indicating that important features such as the locations
of stability bands where µmax = 0 are not shifting around as the time-step is varied. In the
bottom row we show similar convergence plots as the number of grid points are varied while
holding the simulation box size ﬁxed. We show results for a pseudospectral approximation,
a second-order accurate ﬁnite-diﬀerence stencil, and a fourth-order accurate ﬁnite-diﬀerence
stencil.
As promised, the psuedospectral method converges much more rapidly than the
ﬁnite-diﬀerencing methods. Also of note is the uniform convergence for all k⊥with the pseu-
dospectral approximation, whereas the convergence is non-uniform for the ﬁnite-diﬀerence
methods.
Taking the far right 4th order chart as an example, there are several extreme

Convergence of the largest Lyapanov exponent around a sine-Gordon breather with
v = 0.5 for a range of k2
⊥values. The simulation lattice had length L = 58. For reference, the top left
panel shows µmaxTbreather with N = 64 and dt = dx/20. These are the same parameters used along
the line v = 0.5 in the instability chart in ﬁgure 4. In the top right panel, we show the diﬀerence
in the numerically determined values of µmaxTbreather holding the number of grid points ﬁxed (at
N = 64) while varying the discrete time step dt. A pseudospectral derivative approximation was used
for each run and a sixth-order Yoshida integrator for the time evolution. The bottom row shows the
convergence properties as the grid spacing is decreased, using a pseudospectral (bottom left), second-
order ﬁnite-diﬀerence (bottom centre) and fourth-order ﬁnite-diﬀerence (bottom right) approximation
for the Laplacian. In all three panels, we took dx/dt = 20 and used a sixth-order accurate Yoshida
scheme. Because of the rapid convergence, the instability charts (with the exception of the N = 32
case) are visually indistinguishable from the top left panel.
spikes in the region k2
⊥(1 + v−2) for which the diﬀerence between the N = 128 and N = 256
approximation is of order machine precision, but then rises to the 10−3 level when comparing
to the N = 512 solution. The ultimate source of these appearing and disappearing spikes is
a slight shifting of the edges of the stability bands as the resolution is varied.
