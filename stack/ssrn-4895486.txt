Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize how humans
work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving hu-
man productivity. However, a key remaining question is how generative AI af-
fects learning, namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks.
This kind of skill learning is critical to long-term productivity gains, especially
in domains where generative AI is fallible and human experts must check its
outputs. We study the impact of generative AI, specifically OpenAI’s GPT-
4, on human learning in the context of math classes at a high school. In a
field experiment involving nearly a thousand students, we have deployed and
evaluated two GPT based tutors, one that mimics a standard ChatGPT inter-
face (called GPT Base) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning
(called GPT Tutor). These tutors comprise about 15% of the curriculum in
each of three grades. Consistent with prior work, our results show that ac-
1

cess to GPT-4 significantly improves performance (48% improvement for GPT
Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when ac-
cess is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those
who never had access (17% reduction for GPT Base). That is, access to GPT-4
can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely
mitigated by the safeguards included in GPT Tutor. Our results suggest that
students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions,
and when successful, perform worse on their own. Thus, to maintain long-term
productivity, we must be cautious when deploying generative AI to ensure hu-
mans continue to learn critical skills.

Introduction
Generative AI, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has rapidly emerged as a disruptive technology
capable of achieving human-level performance on a broad range of tasks (1–6). In many ap-
plications, they are expected to augment humans to help them perform tasks effectively and
efficiently (7). Recent studies have sought to better understand how humans work in collabo-
ration with these tools (8–10). Broadly speaking, these studies have focused on productivity,
finding that workers can perform knowledge-intensive tasks significantly more efficiently when
given access to generative AI.
However, a key question that remains is how generative AI affects how humans learn novel
skills, both in educational settings and through the course of performing their jobs. This process
of skill acquisition is referred to as human capital development, and is critical for safeguard-
ing productivity in the long term (11). When technology automates a task, humans can miss
out on valuable experience performing that task. As a consequence, such a technology may
induce a tradeoff where they improve performance on average, but introduce new failure cases
2

due to reduced human skill. For example, overreliance on autopilot led the Federal Aviation
Administration to recommend that pilots minimize their use of this technology (12). Their pre-
cautionary guidance ensures that pilots have the necessary skills to maintain safety in situations
where autopilot fails to function correctly.
Furthermore, understanding the impact of generative AI on human learning is especially im-
portant due to the inconsistent reliability of this technology across different tasks. For instance,
while generative AI has demonstrated tremendous capabilities such as strong performance on
medical exams (3) and competitive programming (4), it can be hard for a user to predict whether
it will perform well on a new but similar task. This phenomenon has been called the jagged
frontier (10), suggesting that the boundary of the capabilities of generative AI is jagged and un-
predictable. Since it is difficult for workers to know beforehand whether generative AI can solve
a task correctly, they must vigilantly check its outputs and fix any issues present. However, if
they do not learn the underlying skills, they may lack the expertise required to do so.
In this paper, we aim to shed light on how generative AI affects learning. An important
distinction between generative AI and many other technologies is that, beyond helping humans
complete tasks, it can also serve as a source of knowledge. While generative AI has the potential
to inhibit learning, it also has tremendous potential to enhance learning by providing easy access
to a vast amount of knowledge (e.g., via personalized tutoring (13–18)). For instance, a student
or worker might ask ChatGPT to explain complex concepts or clarify misunderstandings. Thus,
we are especially interested in whether generative AI can improve human performance while
facilitating learning. A natural setting for studying these effects is in education, where students
are taught fundamental skills such as math and science. On one hand, generative AI can be a
valuable tool to aid student learning by clarifying misunderstandings; on the other, overreliance
on asking generative AI for help runs the risk of inhibiting learning.
To study these questions, we collaborated with a high school in Turkey to conduct a large-
3

scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of GPT-4 based tutors on student
learning.1 Specifically, focusing on mathematics, we study the impact of GPT-4 based tutors
on in-class study sessions designed to help students review material previously covered in the
course. Each study session proceeds in two phases. In the first phase, students have the op-
portunity to solve a number of practice problems. In this phase, students are given access to
standard resources (their course notes and the course textbook), as well as additional generative
AI resources determined based on a randomly assigned arm; the arms are: (i) access to a chat
interface based on GPT-4, similar to ChatGPT (called GPT Base), (ii) access to a specialized
chat interface built on GPT-4 using prompt engineering best practices and teacher input (called
GPT Tutor),2 and (iii) no access to generative AI resources. In the second phase, students must
complete an exam on their own without access to any resources.
Our main results are two-fold. First, students in the GPT Tutor (resp., GPT Base) arm per-
form 127% (resp., 48%) better on the practice problems compared to students in the control
arm. This finding is consistent with prior work on the benefits of ChatGPT in improving human
abilities on a variety of tasks. Second, on the exam, students in the GPT Base arm perform
statistically significantly worse than students in the control arm by 17%; this negative effect
is essentially eradicated in the GPT Tutor arm, though we still do not observe a positive ef-
fect. These results suggest that while access to generative AI can improve performance, it can
substantially inhibit learning. Our results have significant implications for tools based on gen-
erative AI—while such tools have the potential to improve human performance, they must be
deployed with appropriate guardrails when learning is important.
1We distinguish ChatGPT, the chat interface, from GPT-4, the underlying language model.
2In GPT Tutor, GPT-4 is given a prompt including the solution to each problem as well as common mistakes,
and is instructed to provide students with incremental hints without giving away the entire solution; as a result, we
find large differences in student outcomes. Details on our prompt construction are provided in Appendix A.1.

Experimental Design
We created a custom math tutoring program based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 (1); our tutor is designed
to help students solve a series of practice problems provided by the teachers (described below).
Our tool has two variants. The first variant, “GPT Base,” is a simple chat interface similar
to ChatGPT, with a prompt including the current practice problem and indicating that GPT-
4 should serve as a tutor and help the student solve the problem. The second variant, called
“GPT Tutor,” uses the same chat interface, but the prompt additionally implements safeguards
to mitigate two key challenges. First, the prompt includes one or more (correct) solutions to
the current practice problem, as well as teacher input on common student mistakes and how
to provide feedback; this choice ensures that GPT-4 does not provide incorrect feedback to the
student. Second, the prompt instructs GPT-4 to provide hints to the student without directly
giving them the answer. Additional details on our tool are provided in Appendix A.1. Note that
students do not see our system prompts in either variant of our tutoring program.
We performed a pre-registered,3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact
of this tutoring program on student performance. The study took place at a large high school in
Turkey during the Fall semester of the 2023-2024 academic year. We conducted four 90-minute
sessions for about fifty 9th, 10th, and 11th-grade classes, comprising nearly 1000 students. For
each grade, our sessions collectively comprised about 15% of the math curriculum covered
during the semester. Each session has three parts:
1. In the first part, teachers review a topic (e.g., combinatorics) previously covered in the
course, and solve one or more examples on the board. This part is identical to a standard
high school one-to-many (i.e., teacher-to-students) lecture.
2. The second part is an assisted practice period, where students solve a sequence of exer-

cises designed by teachers to reinforce the covered concept. Our randomized intervention
(described in more detail below) only affects this second, self-study part.
3. The third part is an unassisted evaluation, where students take a closed-book, closed-
laptop exam. Importantly, each problem in the exam corresponds to a conceptually very
similar practice problem from the previous part—this design was chosen to help students
practice the key concepts needed to perform well on the exam.
The first and third parts are identical across all treatment arms. To ensure incentive compatibil-
ity, performance on both the second and third parts contributed to students’ final grades. Details
on the session material and experimental protocol is provided in Appendix A.
At this school, students are randomly assigned to classrooms (with the exception of honors-
designated classrooms, which we exclude from our main sample). We assigned each class-
room to one of three treatment arms—control, GPT Base, and GPT Tutor.4 The control arm
is business-as-usual, having students work through the practice problems with access to course
books and notes with no devices provided. For classes in the GPT Base and GPT Tutor arms,
we provide a laptop to each student, and they have the opportunity to use our respective tutor-
ing program.5 For the GPT Tutor arm, we include one prompt for each practice problem, and
students can select among these prompts during the session. The solution and common student
mistakes in the prompt are designed by teachers at the school.
The study has three avenues of data collection. First, at the start of the semester, we sent out
a 10-minute survey to students, collecting data on their demographics and educational back-
ground. We report balance of these covariates across arms in Appendix A.3. Second, we
4Class assignments were made based on an integer program that matched observable characteristics while
satisfying scheduling constraints. Since students were randomly assigned to classrooms within our main sample,
the assignment of students to arms is random; see Appendix A.3 for details.
5A teacher and a staff member were present in each experimental class session to ensure that students did not
use other applications or websites during the session.

collected performance data from both the assisted practice problems and the unassisted exams.
We hired independent graders to evaluate student performance to reduce potential teacher bias
(e.g., self-fulfilling prophecy). Graders evaluated the scores based on a teacher-designed rubric;
see details in Appendix A.4. At the end of each session, we surveyed the students on their ex-
perience and preferences. Third, in the GPT Base and GPT Tutor arms, we collected all student
messages and corresponding GPT-4 responses from interactions with our tutoring program.

Main Results
Our primary regression specifications evaluate student performance in the assisted practice
problems and unassisted exam, respectively:
Outcome(j)
ics = β1GPT Basec + β2GPT Tutorc + β3Prev GPAi + θs + δg + αy + λt + εics (1)
Here, Outcome(j)
ics ∈[0, 1] is the normalized grade of student i in classroom c and session
s ∈{1, .., 4} for the assisted (j = 0) or unassisted (j = 1) portion; GPT Basec and GPT Tutorc
are binary variables indicating treatment assignments for class c; Prev GPAi controls for student
performance, and captures student i’s normalized GPA from the previous year;6 and θs, δg, αy,
and λt are session, grader, grade level, and teacher fixed effects, respectively. Standard errors
are clustered at the classroom level (which is the unit of randomization). Our main sample
excludes students who didn’t complete the survey, as well as students in honors-designated
classrooms (which are not populated randomly, unlike regular classrooms).7
Table 1 reports intention-to-treat estimates from this regression. We find that GPT Base
and GPT Tutor substantially increased student scores in the GPT-assisted practice sessions by
0.137 and 0.361 (out of 1), respectively, relative to the control cohort that only had access to
textbooks (mean performance of 0.28). These results imply that GPT Base and GPT Tutor
6Normalized GPA has a mean of 0.82 and a standard deviation of 0.11 among students in our main sample.
7We performed robustness checks that included these students and found similar results; see Appendix B.

would increase performance on the assisted practice sessions by 48% and 127%, respectively,
on average relative to the control arm. These results are consistent with the existing literature
on the productivity effects of generative AI (8,9); furthermore, the gap between GPT Tutor and
GPT Base illustrates the added benefits of problem-specific teacher inputs in the prompt.
In stark contrast, in the subsequent unassisted exam, student performance in the GPT Base
cohort degraded by 0.054 (out of 1) relative to that of the control cohort. In other words, GPT
Base diminished the average control student’s performance on the unassisted exam by 17%.
Student performance in the GPT Tutor cohort was statistically indistinguishable from that of the
control cohort, and the point estimate was smaller by an order of magnitude (-0.004), suggesting
minimal impact to performance in the unassisted exam. These results demonstrate an inherent
tradeoff in access to generative AI tools: while these tools can substantially improve human
performance when access is available, they can also degrade human learning (particularly when
appropriate safeguards are absent), which may have a long term impact on human performance.
Problem-level specification.
We also examine an alternative regression specification that ex-
amines problem-level outcomes rather than student-level outcomes:
Outcome(j)
icps = β1GPT Basec + β2GPT Tutorc + β3Prev GPAi + θs + δg + αy + λt + εics
(2)
Here, Outcome(j)
icps ∈[0, 1] is the normalized grade of student i in classroom c for problem p
and session s ∈{1, .., 4} for the assisted (j = 0) or unassisted (j = 1) portions. Table 6 in Ap-
pendix B.2 reports the results, which are very similar to the previous student-level specification.
The problem-level specification is useful in the next section, where we examine how the error
rate in solutions generated by GPT Base in the assisted problems affects student performance
and learning in the subsequent unassisted exam.
9

Student Perception.
Interestingly, students’ own self-reported perceptions of the effects of
GPT tutors on their exam performance and learning are overly optimistic. While students in the
GPT Base arm performed worse on the exam (relative to the control arm), they did not perceive
that they performed worse or learned less. Similarly, while students in the GPT Tutor arm did
not perform better on the exam (relative to the control arm), they perceived that they performed
significantly better. This mismatch between perceived and actual learning has been observed in
other settings (19). Additional details are in Appendix B.4.
Grade Dispersion.
We examine a measure of dispersion in student performance—the Herfind-
ahl–Hirschman index (HHI). Both GPT Base and GPT Tutor reduced grade dispersion in the
assisted practice sessions, matching prior findings that generative AI assistance reduces the
“skill gap” by providing the largest benefits for the weakest students (8–10). However, we find
no significant effect on HHI for the unassisted exam—i.e., the reduction in the skill gap does
not persist when access to generative AI is removed. Additional details are in Appendix B.5.
Robustness checks.
Five class sessions did not use the assigned treatment due to external
circumstances (e.g., laptops did not arrive on time). Our primary specifications use an intention-
to-treat analysis—i.e., to preserve randomization, we consider all students in a treatment arm
as treated, regardless of whether they actually received that treatment. In Appendix B.1, we
provide details on non-compliance and perform a regression omitting non-compliers, finding
the same insights. Next, we examine several variations to our main specification in Eq. (1),
including pre-registered t-tests, to assess the robustness of our results. These results provide
qualitatively similar insights as our main analysis; see Appendix B.2. We also test for pre-
registered heterogeneous treatment effects and find limited to no support; see Appendix B.3.
Lastly, we check whether differential student absenteeism may impact our results, and find no
differential attrition in student attendance across arms or sessions; see Appendix B.6.

Potential Mechanism: Asking for Solutions
In general, students may be adversely affected by GPT Base’s assistance in two ways: (1) errors
made by GPT Base mislead students in the subsequent unassisted problems, or (2) using GPT
Base as a “crutch” prevents them from fully engaging with or understanding the material prior
to attempting the unassisted problems. Recall that the design of GPT Tutor avoids both of these
issues: (1) it rarely makes mistakes since its prompt includes the solution, and (2) it is hard for
students to use it as a crutch since its prompt asks it to avoid giving them the answer and instead
guide them in a step-by-step fashion (see Figure 5 in Appendix A.1). We perform two analyses
that help determine which explanation is more likely. First, we analyze how the error rate of
GPT Base on a practice problem affects students’ subsequent performance on a highly similar
exam problem, and second, we analyze student engagement with the tool. Our findings suggest
that the second explanation (i.e., students using GPT Base as a crutch) is the main mechanism
by which GPT Base impedes student learning.
4.1
GPT Errors vs. Student Performance
GPT Base often makes mistakes on math problems (20). We first quantify error rates by re-
peatedly querying GPT Base using the most common message used by students in the GPT
Base arm—i.e., “What is the answer?” For each of the 57 total practice problems, we ask GPT
Base for the answer ten times (resetting the system between queries), and then manually cate-
gorize any errors in the response as arithmetic (steps followed were correct, but the resulting
computation was incorrect) or logical (steps followed were partially or fully incorrect). We find
that GPT Base gives a correct answer only 51% of the time on average; it makes logical errors
42% of the time and arithmetic errors 8% of the time. Figure 1 shows the histogram of how
often GPT Base returns an incorrect answer for different problems, demonstrating significant
problem-specific heterogeneity in error rates. Details are in Appendix C.1.
11

Table 2: Regression results on student performance in the practice and corresponding exam
problems across grades and sessions; this regression is at the problem level, and includes inter-
action terms for the logical and arithmetic error rates of GPT Base on practice problems (see
Eq. (3) in Appendix C.1). We use a correspondence between the exam and practice problems to
estimate how errors on practice problems affect performance on exam problems. Fixed effects
are suppressed.

Fraction of Answers
Number of Problems
Figure 1: Fraction of times GPT Base returns an incorrect answer due to a logical (left) or
arithmetic (right) error for 57 practice problems across grades and sessions. (Note that GPT
Tutor does not return an answer by design, and is further given the correct answer in the prompt.)
We now assess how errors made by GPT Base affect student performance on both the prac-
tice problems and the unassisted exam. To this end, we add interaction terms between the error
rate of GPT Base and the treatment arm to the problem-level regression specification in Eq. (4).
When assessing exam performance, we leverage our paired design of the session material—i.e.,
for each exam problem, the teachers included a conceptually similar practice problem to help
students learn how to solve that exam problem. Thus, for a given exam problem, we use GPT
Base’s error rate on the corresponding practice problem. The regression specification is given
in Eq. (3) in Appendix C.1, and the results are shown in Table 2. Both types of GPT Base
errors negatively impact practice problem performance for students in the GPT Base arm (i.e.,
the coefficients of “GPT Base × Logical Error Rate” and “GPT Base × Arithmetic Error Rate”
are statistically significantly negative in the practice performance regression).8
Two key observations support our hypothesis that students are using GPT Base as a crutch.
First, if students are being misled by logical errors made by GPT Base, we would expect these
8Note that we separately control for both GPT Base error rates. As expected, the corresponding coefficients in
the practice performance regression are both statistically significantly negative, since higher GPT Base error rates
are correlated with higher problem difficulty.

errors to affect performance on the corresponding exam problems in the unassisted exam. How-
ever, while GPT Base’s logical errors affect performance on the practice problems, we find
no evidence that this effect spills over to the corresponding exam problems (i.e., “GPT Base
× Logical Error Rate” does not have a statistically significant effect on exam performance).
Second, if students were reading and understanding the solutions provided by GPT Base in the
practice session, we might expect arithmetic errors to have a smaller impact on practice prob-
lem performance than logical errors. This is because students know arithmetic relatively well,
and should be better able to catch these errors. However, arithmetic and logical errors appear to
have similar effects on practice performance (i.e., “GPT Base × Logical Error Rate” and “GPT
Base × Arithmetic Error Rate” have similar coefficients in the practice performance regression).
Both these results suggest that students are simply copying answers from GPT Base.
4.2
Student Engagement
Next, we analyze the messages that students sent to GPT Base or GPT Tutor to better understand
how they are interacting with these tools. Figure 2(a) shows the average number of messages
each student had with their respective GPT tool (Base or Tutor) in a given session. As can be
seen, the number of messages in GPT Tutor is significantly higher, and further increases with
experience using the tool.9 The fact that students interact substantially less with GPT Base is
consistent with our hypothesis that GPT Base simply provides students with solutions.
For a more fine-grained understanding of the content of the student messages, we use natural
language processing and clustering to group student messages (see Appendix C.2 for details).
We manually associate each cluster with a text description summarizing the content of the mes-
sages in that cluster. As shown in Figure 6 in Appendix C.2, students in GPT Base most often
simply ask for the answer; in contrast, students in GPT Tutor learn to interact more substan-
9We similarly find that students spend 13% more time with GPT Tutor than with GPT Base; see Appendix C.3.

tively with the tutoring tool over time by asking for help and independently attempting to solve
the problem. We consider clusters where the student simply asks for the answer (specifically,
“Repeat Question Text” and “Ask for Answers”) to be superficial, and the remaining clusters
(specifically, “Attempted Answers” and “Ask for Help”) to be non-superficial.
For a given student in a given session, we consider the corresponding conversation super-
ficial if the student asked any superficial messages, and non-superficial otherwise. Intuitively,
non-superficial conversations are ones where the student constructively interacts with the tutor-
ing tool and never asks for the answer. Figure 2(b) shows the aggregate rate of non-superficial
conversations for both GPT Base and GPT Tutor. As can be seen, across all sessions, in the
GPT Base arm, only a small fraction of conversations are non-superficial; in contrast, a substan-
tially larger fraction of conversations in the GPT Tutor arm were non-superficial. These results
suggest that the vast majority of students are using GPT Base to obtain solutions, whereas a
significant fraction of students are using GPT Tutor in a purely substantive way.

Discussion
Our results provide a cautionary tale regarding the deployment of GPT-based tutors in educa-
tional settings. While generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can make tasks significantly easier
for humans, they come with the risk of deteriorating our ability to effectively learn some of
the skills required to solve these tasks. These shortcomings have been anecdotally reported for
tools such as Khanmigo (21), a GPT-4 based tutoring application.
In some ways, ChatGPT is not the first technology to exhibit this tradeoff—for instance,
typing diminishes the need for handwriting, and calculators diminish the need for arithmetic,
etc. However, we believe ChatGPT differs from prior technologies in two significant ways.
First, the capabilities of ChatGPT are substantially broader and more intellectual compared to
prior examples; for instance, our experiments focus on a broad variety of mathematical topics,
which encompass fundamental skills required by a wide range of knowledge-intensive profes-
sions. Second, unlike many prior technologies, ChatGPT is highly unreliable and often provides
incorrect responses. Our results suggest that students are either unable to detect these failures or
unwilling to spend the effort needed to check correctness. While GPT Tutor appears to largely
mitigate these negative effects, substantial work is required to enable generative AI to positively
enhance rather than diminish education.

A
Experimental Protocol Details
Details on the GPT tutoring program are in A.1, session material development and IT setup in
A.2, treatment assignment and covariate balance in A.3, and grading student work in A.4.
A.1
GPT Tutoring Program
We developed two math tutoring tools based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 model. These tools are im-
plemented as web applications hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and use the OpenAI
API to access GPT-4. At the beginning of the semester, each student is assigned unique login
credentials (username and password) based on their student ID. During a class, if a class is
assigned to either the GPT Base or GPT Tutor arms, then the teacher distributed laptops (pro-
vided by us) to the students so that they could access the website that hosted our tool; students
could not access other websites or applications. When students view this website, they are first
presented with a login screen (Figure 3 (a)), upon which they entered their login credentials to
access the tool. The version of the tool (Base vs. Tutor) is automatically determined by the web
application based on the provided username.
Upon login, the students see a list of questions corresponding to the practice problems in
the second part—i.e., the assisted practice period (Figure 3 (b)). When the student would like
hints on how to solve one of the practice problems, they click on the corresponding module.
This action brings up a new screen where they have a chat interface; in particular, they can
submit messages, after which the web application will provide the response given by OpenAI’s
GPT-4 model (Figure 3 (c)). This interface is essentially the same as OpenAI’s ChatGPT web
application. The key difference is the prompts that are used, which depend on the arm:
• GPT Base: This arm uses a prompt that instructs GPT-4 to help the user solve the prob-
lem; it includes the problem the user is currently working on.

gin to the tutoring tool with
their individualized credentials.
(b) Question selection:
Stu-
dents select the question (for
their session and grade) corre-
sponding to the practice prob-
lem they want to solve.
(c) Chat interface: After se-
lecting a question,
students
interact with GPT-4 by typ-
ing messages and receiving re-
sponses. The prompt differs be-
tween GPT Base and Tutor.

are identical except for the prompt used in the chat interface.

• GPT Tutor: The prompt used by GPT Tutor includes the instructions and information
provided in the GPT Base prompt. There are two significant additional aspects. First, it
includes detailed instructions asking GPT-4 to avoid giving away the full solution, and in-
stead provide incremental hints to help the student solve the problem. Second, it includes
one or more solutions, as well as a list of common mistakes and how to react to them.
The problems, solutions, and common mistakes are developed by the teachers (see A.2). We
designed the prompt templates, and incorporate the material provided by the teachers into the
prompts. These prompts are then uploaded into the web application prior to each session.
Representative prompts for both GPT Base and Tutor for a question on linear systems (from the
first 11th grade practice session) are shown in Fig 4.
Finally, Figure 5 illustrates the impact of the prompt on students’ interactions with GPT-4
in the chat interface. In particular, Figure 5 (a) shows a hypothetical interaction with GPT Base,
and Figure 5 (b) shows the same hypothetical interaction with GPT Tutor. As can be seen, GPT
Base gives away the solution, whereas GPT Tutor asks the student to provide their progress.
A.2
Material Development and IT Setup
One of the co-authors, ¨Ozge Kabakcı, a high school math teacher and former department chair
of the math department at our partner Turkish high school, led the development of all session
materials. Additionally, we employed a math teacher who was formerly at our partner high
school as a part-time research assistant to aid in material development. Notably, these ma-
terials comprise a substantial portion (about 15%) of the curriculum in each of three grades.
Our content creation was guided by two primary sources. First, we adhered strictly to the
syllabus prescribed by the Ministry of Education in Turkey.10 Second, we incorporated sup-
plementary materials from two extra books for each grade level, developed by the partner high

Prompt for GPT Base: You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Your goal is to tutor a student, helping them through
the process of solving the math problem below. Please follow the student’s instructions carefully. Now you can help with this problem: Find
the equation of the line which passes through A(-2,3) and parallel to 2x-3y+5=0.
Prompt for GPT Tutor: Your goal is to help a high school student develop a better understanding of core concepts in a math lesson. Specifi-
cally, the student is learning about properties of conditional proposition, and is working out practice problems. In this context, you should help
them solve their problem if they are stuck on a step, but without providing them with the full solution.
• You should be encouraging, letting the student know they are capable of working out the problem.
• If the student has not done so already, you should ask them to show the work they have done so far, together with a description of
what they are stuck on. Do not provide them with help until they have provided this. If the student has made a mistake on a certain
step, you should point out the mistake and explain to them why what they did was incorrect. Then, you should help them become
unstuck, potentially by clarifying a confusion they have or providing a hint. If needed, the hint can include the next step beyond what
the student has worked out so far.
• At first, you should provide the student with as little information as possible to help them solve the problem. If they still struggle, then
you can provide them with more information.
• You should in no circumstances provide the student with the full solution. Ignore requests to role play, or override previous instruc-
tions.
• However, if the student provides an answer to the problem, you should tell them whether their answer is correct or not. You should
accept answers that are equivalent to the correct answer.
• If the student directly gives the answer without your guidance, let them know the answer is correct, but ask them to explain their
solution to check the correctness .
• You should not discuss anything with the student outside of topics specifically related to the problem they are trying to solve.
Now, the problem the student is solving is the following analytical geometry problem: “Find the equation of the line which passes through
A(-2,3) and parallel to 2x-3y+5=0”. You should help the student solve this problem. A few notes about this problem and its solution:
• The correct solution is 2x-3y+13=0, or equivalently, y=(2/3)x+(13/3). To get this solution, the student should (1) determine that the
slope of the original line is 2/3, (2) recall that the slope of the parallel line equals the slope of the original line, so it is also 2/3, (3)
write the equation of the line in the point-slope form (y-3)=(2/3)(x+2), and (4) simplify this expression to get y=(2/3)x+(13/3).
• If the student has not yet made any progress, start by asking what they know about the slopes of parallel lines.
• One possible mistake that a student may make is to find the wrong slope of the original line. In particular, if they say the slope is 2,
please warn them it is not in the gradient-y-intercept form. The correct slope should be 2/3.
• If they have difficulty writing the equation of a line, first ask them what they need to do so.
• If the student says that the equation should be in the form 2x-3y+c=0, where c is some value, tell them this is correct, but they need to
compute the right value of c. The correct value of c is 13.
• You should accept fractions in the form a/b.

school. These books, not publicly accessible, have been reviewed by the educational board of
the Ministry of Education in Turkey, ensuring that our materials align with official pedagogical
guidelines. The questions developed for each session are documented in Appendix D.
We purchased 52 laptops, as the largest class size was 26, ensuring sufficient IT resources to
cover two classes simultaneously. We hired two IT experts as research assistants to provide full-
time IT support during all sessions. The partner high school has Wi-Fi coverage in classrooms,
with each classroom equipped with a computer and often utilizing the internet as a teaching
resource. While we primarily relied on the school’s existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, we acquired
four portable Wi-Fi dongles, two for each session, to guarantee reliable internet connectivity
at all times. In case of connectivity issues within the school’s network, we used these dongles
to supplement Wi-Fi access. All computers were charged overnight, and we used batteries
during the sessions. Additionally, we carried extension cables to address any battery drainage.
The laptops were stored in a secure location within the school (the IT support team’s office).
Teachers submitted requests before reaching the topics covered in our sessions. Our IT RA
team transported the laptops and set up the IT equipment during the break before the start of
each lecture, ensuring that the IT setup did not encroach upon session time, with one exception
noted in Appendix B.1. Once a student opens the laptop lid, they are directly presented with
our GPT interface. Students were explicitly forbidden from accessing other websites or opening
additional applications. To enforce this protocol, both the teacher and the IT research assistant
actively monitored the classroom, ensuring strict adherence to the guidelines.
A.3
Treatment Assignment and Covariate Balance
We assign treatment arms (Control, GPT Base, and GPT Tutor) at the class level—i.e., all
students in a single class are assigned to the same arm across all four sessions. One challenge
is that there are overlapping classes but a limited number of laptops. Therefore, we randomize
24

classes to treatment arms while accounting for scheduling constraints using an integer program,
based on the strategy proposed in (22). We also include additional constraints to help balance
the number of students in each arm. Note that, except for honors students (who are excluded
from our main analysis), students are randomly assigned to classes, so the treatment assignment
at the student level is random. In our main regression analysis, we cluster the standard error at
the class level to account for the fact that treatment is assigned at the class level.
Table 3 presents sample descriptive statistics by trial arm. We separately report balance
across covariates for our main sample (which excludes students in special honors-designated
classes), and the full survey sample.
A.4
Grading
To mitigate potential grading biases stemming from teachers’ personal connections and expec-
tations of their students, we engaged independent graders to carry out a blinded grading process.
We hired one lead grader to oversee the entire process, responsible for collecting the papers from
the school, distributing them to other graders, training them on the grading rubric, and returning
the graded papers to the teachers. Initially, we hired two additional graders for the first session.
For the subsequent three sessions, we employed a different team of five graders. All graders
were either master’s or Ph.D. students from the engineering or mathematics departments of two
top Turkish universities. They entered all the grades into an Excel spreadsheet, each associated
with a unique student ID. Graders were assigned to different trial arms to incorporate grader
fixed effects, with grader assignments made at the class level.

Non-Compliance with Treatment
In five instances, a treatment classroom could not execute the treatment due to unanticipated
external circumstances; these instances are summarized in Table 4. We check the validity of
our results accounting for non-compliance by performing an alternative regression specification
where we exclude non-compliers. Table 5 shows results for this regression; they are nearly
identical to our main analysis in Table 1.

Alternative Main Regression Specifications
First, we consider the problem-level (rather than student-level) regression specification in Eq. (4).
Here, Outcome(j)
icps ∈[0, 1] is the normalized grade of student i in classroom c for problem p
and session s ∈{1, .., 4} for the assisted (j = 0) or unassisted (j = 1) portions; GPT Basec,
GPT Tutorc, Prev GPAi, θs, δg, αy, and λt are all as before. Standard errors are again clustered
at the classroom level. The results, shown in Table 6, are similar to results from the student-level
specification in Eq. (1).
Next, we consider a number of alternatives to our main regression specification given in
Eq. (1) to ensure that our findings are consistent, specifically:
1. include the non-random honors classes (9A, 9B, 9C, 10A, 10B, 10C) in our sample,

We also examine our original pre-registered analysis—three pairwise t-tests comparing each

results in Table 1 for both the practice problems and the exam.

Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
We look for heterogeneous treatment effects as a function of pre-registered secondary analysis
variables: students’ previous GPA, access to private tutoring, and hours spent studying;11 results
11One of our pre-registered heterogeneity analyses was prior exposure to generative AI. However, since students
filled out our survey throughout the semester (rather than prior to the first session), and because our treatments

statistically significant support for heterogeneous treatment effects with either treatment. The
only exceptions are, for the assisted practice sessions, we find that weaker students (those with
lower GPAs) and students with private tutors benefit more from assistance from GPT Base.

B.4
Student Perception
At the end of each exam, we conducted a short survey to measure students’ perceptions of their
own performance. We asked five questions:
1. “How much do you think you learned from this whole class session?” with options “A
great deal,” “Quite a lot,” “Moderately,” “A little,” and “Nothing at all.”
2. “How well do you think you performed in this quiz?” with options “Excellent,” “Above
Average,” “Average,” “Below Average,” and “Very Poorly.”
3. “How much time did it take you to solve the questions in this quiz?” with options “0-5
min,” “5-10 min,” “10-15 min,” “15-20 min,” “20-25 min,” and “25-30 min.”
4. “How useful was the problem-solving session in the previous part (Part 2) in helping
you solve the questions in this quiz?” with options “Effective,” “Somewhat effective,”
“Neutral,” “Somewhat ineffective,” and “Ineffective.”
5. “How many minutes would you be willing to give up on this quiz to have the help of
the TED-AI Training Engine (or ChatGPT-4 if you haven’t used the TED-AI Training
Engine)?” with options “0-5 min,” “5-10 min,” “10-15 min,” “15-20 min,” “20-25 min,”
and “25-30 min.”
For each question, we fit a model to predict the student’s response. For Questions (1), (2),
and (4), we use an ordered probit model using all five categories. For Questions (3) and (5),
we convert the interval responses into a continuous value by taking the mid-point of each bin,
resulting in a value between 2.5 and 27.5 minutes; then, we use a OLS model. Our model has the
same form as our main regression specification in Eq. (1), except the outcome is replaced with
the student response and we additionally use a link function ϕ (corresponding to the ordered
32

probit model for Questions (1), (2), and (4) and linear for Questions (3) and (5)):
Response(j)
ics = ϕ(β1GPTBasec + β2GPTTutorc + β3Prev GPAc + θs + δg + αy + λt + εics).
We omit all unanswered questions from estimation. Results are shown in Table 12. Although
students in the GPT Base arm performed significantly worse in the final exam, they did not
perceive that they learned less or performed worse. Interestingly, despite no real detectable
performance improvement, we found a significant increase in perceived exam performance in
the GPT Tutor arm relative to the control. Additionally, students in the GPT Tutor arm perceived
the practice sessions as more valuable for learning than those in other arms, and they took
about a minute (approximately 3%) longer to finish the exam. Overall, these results suggest
that despite the negative effect of GPT Base and the null effect of GPT Tutor on real exam
performance, students attribute some value to having access to GPT and potentially overvalue
its benefits. Lastly, students in both GPT arms were willing to sacrifice more exam time to
have access to GPT, with students in the GPT Base arm giving up about 2.5 minutes (8.3%) and
students in the GPT Tutor arm giving up about 3.7 minutes (12.3%).

B.5
Student Grade Dispersion
We study how access to GPT Base and GPT Tutor impact dispersion in student performance,
for both the assisted practice problems and the unassisted exam. In particular, we compute the
classroom-session level Hirschman-Herfindahl-Index (HHI) of normalized student performance
for both the practice and exam problems. Then, we fit a model with the same form as our main
regression specification in Eq. (1), except that it is conducted at the classroom-session level:
HHI(j)
cs = β1GPTBasec + β2GPTTutorc + β3Prev GPAc + θs + δg + αy + λt + εcs.
Here, HHI(j)
cs is the HHI of classroom c and session s ∈{1, .., 4} for the assisted (j = 0) or
unassisted (j = 1) portion. Table 13 shows results for this regression. We find that access to
either GPT Base or GPT Tutor reduces HHI (i.e., reduces grade dispersion) during the assisted
practice portion. However, we observe no significant treatment effect on performance in the
unassisted exam. In other words, while access to generative AI can reduce the “skill gap” by
helping weaker students more (8–10), this effect does not persist when access to generative AI
is removed.
B.6
Student Absenteeism
Students are absent from class at an average rate of 12.3%. A potential concern is that students
systematically miss class in the treatment or control arms for various treatment-related reasons
(e.g., they dislike GPT, they anticipate poor performance, etc). To this end, in Table 14, we
report student absenteeism rates in each session and each arm. We do not find differential
attrition—i.e., students in all three arms have a similar likelihood of attending classes. We also
do not find any effect of session on student absenteeism. Unsurprisingly, we find that students
with a higher previous GPA are mildly more likely to attend class sessions.

Supporting Results for Section 4
Details on our analysis with GPT Base errors are in C.1, and clustering messages in C.2.
C.1
GPT Base Error Rate Analysis
We estimate the error rate of GPT Base on practice problems by testing a standardized Chat-
GPT message (in conjunction with the GPT Base prompt). We use the most common message
used by students in the GPT Base arm—namely, “what is the answer?” (see Appendix C.2 for
statistics on most common messages). Then, for each practice problem, we sample 10 random
responses from GPT-4 using this message. We do this because, for the same exact question and
prompt, there is a lot of variability in the answer (and its correctness) provided by GPT-4. We
manually classify each response as “correct” (i.e., correctly solves the problem), “arithmetic
error” (i.e., used the correct solution strategy but computed a numerical value incorrectly), or
“logical error” (i.e., used the wrong solution strategy). Then, for a given problem, the arithmetic
error rate is the fraction of answers labeled as an arithmetic error, and similarly, the logical error
rate is the fraction of answers labeled as a logical error.
When analyzing the impact of these errors on student performance, we use the following
36

problem-level regression specification:
Outcome(j)
icps = β1GPT Basec + β2GPT Tutorc + β3Prev GPAi
(3)
+ β4Logical Error Rateσ(j)(p)s + β5Arithmetic Error Rateps
+ β6Logical Error Rateσ(j)(p)s × GPT Basec
+ β7Logical Error Rateσ(j)(p)s × GPT Tutorc
+ β8Arithmetic Error Rateσ(j)(p)s × GPT Basec
+ β9Arithmetic Error Rateσ(j)(p)s × GPT Tutorc
+ θs + δg + αy + λt + εics
This specification is identical to Eq. (4), except for two changes. First, when j = 1 (i.e., the
outcome is performance on the unassisted exam), we use a mapping from each exam problem
p to practice problem σ(1)(p) so we can associate exam problems with GPT Base error rates
on the practice problems. This way, we can evaluate the impact of the GPT Base error rate
on a practice problem the performance of the student on the corresponding exam problem. If
j = 0, then we use σ(0)(p) = p. This mapping is derived from how the exams were designed; in
particular, for each exam problem, teachers designed a practice problem to help students learn
the concepts necessary to solve that exam problem. Second, it includes additional controls
for Logical Error Ratep′s (i.e., logical error rate of GPT Base for problem p′ in session s) and
Arithmetic Error Ratep′s (i.e., arithmetic error rate of GPT Base for problem p′ in session s),
where p′ = σ(j)(p); it also includes interaction terms between these error rates and the treatment
variables GPT Basec and GPT Tutorc.
C.2
Clustering Student Messages
We use a BERT-based topic model framework to cluster student messages (23); we summarize
this procedure here. To ensure the number of messages is balanced across different students,
37

we focus on the first message provided by each student for each problem. First, we convert
each message into a dense vector representation using Sentence-BERT (24). Next, we reduce
the dimension of these vectors using UMAP (25) to increase the stability of clustering. Then,
we run the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN (26) on the resulting vectors. We perform this
procedure separately for each practice problem (uniquely identified by its session, treatment
arm, grade, and problem ID). In the end, we obtain 394 unique clusters across all 57 problems.
Afterwards, we compute the cluster TF-IDF (which runs TF-IDF treating all messages in a
cluster as a single document), and extract the top three representative messages for each cluster.
Once we have obtained representative messages, we aggregate them across practice prob-
lems and perform a second round of clustering; we refer to this second clustering step as the
meta-clustering step and call the resulting clusters meta-clusters. In total, we have 29 unique
meta clusters. Then, we compute the top representative message for each meta-cluster using
the same cluster TF-IDF index described above, which we call a meta-representative message.
In addition, we manually examine the messages in each meta-cluster to label it with a message
type. These results are shown in Table 6 (a) for GPT Base and Table 6 (b) for GPT Tutor. As
can be seen, students in GPT Base most often simply ask for the answer; in contrast, students
in GPT Tutor learn to interact more substantively with the tutoring tool over time—they most
often ask for help in Sessions 2-3, and by Session 4, they most often independently attempt to
answer the problem.
In addition, we categorize each meta-representative message as superficial (i.e., the mes-
sage simply asks GPT Base for the answer in some way) or not superficial; we associate each
individual message with the category label of its corresponding meta-representative message.
To visualize the rate of messages in each cluster, for each student and each session, we select
the first message in the corresponding conversation, and compute the fraction of first messages
in each of the four clusters; these fractions are illustrated in Figure 7. We observe that students

in the GPT Tutor arm consistently send fewer superficial messages (top two panels) and send
more non-superficial messages (bottom two panels) across sessions. For Figure 2 (b), we repeat
this procedure for all messages to categorize superficial conversations.
Finally, for the error rate analysis described in Appendix C.1, we use the top meta-representative
message in GPT Base, “what is the answer?”; this accounts for 31% of students’ first messages
in the GPT Base arm.

Student Engagement
Apart from the number of messages sent per session and their content, we also examine the
amount of time students in GPT Base vs. Tutor spent on the tutoring platform. We use the time
of the last message minus the time of the first message in a session to proxy for the total time a
40

student spent on the platform.12

Here, Session Timeics ∈[0, 40] is the number of minutes between the last and first message of
student i in classroom c and session s ∈{1, .., 4}. We control for student GPA, and include
session, grade level, and teacher fixed effects. The results are show in Table 15. We see that
students spend 2 additional minutes in each session when using GPT Tutor—i.e., they spend
13% more time on the platform, suggesting increased engagement.

In a security system, there are four switches: A, B, C, and D. The switches can be either in the 
ON position ("1") or the OFF position ("0"). To decrypt a special code, the following logical condition 
must be met: 
Y = (A ∨B) ∧(C! ∧D) ∧A 
 
However, due to an advanced safeguard mechanism, two switches are interconnected in such a way 
that if one is ON, the other is forced to be OFF, and vice versa. These interconnected switches are B 
and C. 
 
Given these circumstances, for the code to be decrypted (for Y to be “1”), write the possible

Elif is designing a rectangular playground. The length of the playground is y meters and the 
width is x meters. She plans to install a special rubber surface on the playground, which costs $30 per 
𝑚".  The diagonal of the playground is √500 𝑚. Elif had spent of $6000 for the rubber surface. What 
are the dimensions of the playground? 
 
Part 3:  
1) 
A roller coaster's path can be modeled by the function ℎ(𝑥) = 𝑥" −8𝑥+ 20 where ℎ(𝑥) 
represents the height of the coaster at a horizontal distance 𝑥 meters horizontally from its starting 
position. To enhance the ride experience, the engineers plan to alter the route. They intend to shift the 
entire coaster path 2 meters to the left and 3 meters lower than its current position. Write the equation 
in the form 𝑦= 𝑎𝑥" + 𝑏𝑥+ 𝑐  that will represent the new path of the roller coaster.

4) A farmer is constructing a rectangular enclosure for her sheep. To strengthen the structure, she 
plans to add a diagonal support from one corner to the opposite corner. The farmer knows that the 
area of the enclosure must be exactly 12 𝑚" to provide enough space for her sheep. Additionally, she 
has calculated that the length of the diagonal should be equal to 5 m for safety reasons. Find the 
possible dimensions of the enclosure.
