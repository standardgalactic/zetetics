WHAT IS…
the Amplituhedron?

The amplituhedron is a space whose geometric struc-
ture conjecturally determines scattering amplitudes in a
certain class of quantum ﬁeld theories. When it was intro-
duced in 2013 by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka [1], Quanta
Magazine1 reported that “Physicists have discovered a
jewel-like geometric object that dramatically simpliﬁes

short article, we will not get
as far as challenging the
notions of space and time,
but we will give some ex-
planation as to the nature
and signiﬁcance of the am-
plituhedron both in physics
and mathematics—where it
arises as a natural gener-
alization of the subject of
total positivity for Grassmannians.
Let us begin with the origin of these ideas in the physics
of scattering amplitudes. For any particular quantum ﬁeld
theory, the probability for some number of particles to
‘scatter’ and produce some number of others is encoded
by a function called the (scattering) amplitude for that
process. These functions depend on all the observable
numbers labeling the states involved in the process—in
particular, momenta and helicity. Amplitudes can (often)
be determined perturbatively according to the Feynman
‘loop’ expansion. At leading order, they are rational

functions of the momenta; and at the ‘ℓloop’ order of
perturbation, they are integrals over rational forms on
the space of ℓinternal loop momenta.
Scattering amplitudes are the bread and butter of
quantum ﬁeld theory; but they are notoriously diﬃcult
to compute using the Feynman expansion. Moreover,
individual Feynman diagrams depend on many unob-
servable parameters which can greatly obscure the
(often incredible) simplicity of amplitudes’ mathematical
structure.
A major breakthrough in physicists’ understanding of
(and ability to compute) scattering amplitudes came in
2004 with the discovery of recursion relations for tree-
level (ℓ= 0) amplitudes by Britto, Cachazo, Feng, and
Witten [3]. They were ﬁrst described graphically as in
Figure 1:
Figure 1. Recursion relations for amplitudes, encoded
in terms of bi-colored, trivalent graphs.
The precise meaning of these graphs will not be
important to us, but a few aspects are worth mentioning.
In Figure 1, amplitudes are represented by grey circles, and
any two legs may be chosen for the recursion (indicated
by arrows). Thus, the BCFW recursion relations do not
provide any particular representation of an amplitude in
terms of graphs, but lead to a wide variety of inequivalent
representations according to which two legs are chosen
at every subsequent order of the recursion. The variety of
possible recursive formulae obtained was reminiscent of
diﬀerent ‘triangulations’ of a polytope—an analogy that
would be made sharp by the amplituhedron.
For several years after their discovery, the primary
importance of the recursion relations followed from

the fact that they yield incredibly more compact—and
physically more transparent—representations for tree-
level amplitudes. Processes that would have required
more Feynman diagrams than atoms in the universe
could now be represented by a single diagram. Another
surprising feature of these relations was the discovery
that individual terms enjoy much more symmetry than
anyone had anticipated. These new symmetries were
shown to hold for amplitudes, and were later identiﬁed
with a Yangian Lie algebra.
Another key breakthrough came in 2009, when physi-
cists discovered that the graphs arising in Figure 1 could
be related to volume-forms on certain sub-varieties of
Gr≥0(𝑘, 𝑛)—the “nonnegative” portion of the Grassman-
nian of 𝑘-dimensional subspaces of ℝ𝑛, to be deﬁned
momentarily. Here, 𝑛, 𝑘are determined by the graph: 𝑛is
the number of external edges, and 𝑘= 2𝑛𝐵+ 𝑛𝑊−𝑛𝐼−2
for a graph with 𝑛𝐵, 𝑛𝑊blue and white vertices, re-
spectively, and 𝑛𝐼internal edges. (The correspondence
between these graphs and the totally nonnegative Grass-
mannian was fully understood by mathematicians, such
as Postnikov, considerably before physicists stumbled
upon it independently.) The physical implications of this
correspondence, together with its generalization to all
orders of perturbation, can be found in [2].
Given the correspondence between the terms gener-
ated by BCFW (and its all-orders generalization) and the
Grassmannian, it was natural to wonder if a more in-
trinsically geometric picture existed. Speciﬁcally, can the
recursion relations be literally viewed as ‘triangulating’
some region in the Grassmannian? And if so, can this
space be deﬁned intrinsically—without reference to how
it should be triangulated? In 2013, Arkani-Hamed and
Trnka proposed the amplituhedron as the answer to both
questions for the case of amplitudes in planar, maximally
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [1].
Let us now turn to giving a precise mathematical
deﬁnition of the amplituhedron, in the 0 loop “tree” case.
(The ℓloop amplituhedron for ℓ> 0 has a deﬁnition
which is similar but somewhat more complicated; we will
not discuss it further.) Let 𝑀∈Mat(𝑘× 𝑛) be a 𝑘× 𝑛
matrix of real numbers, with 𝑘≤𝑛. As we recall from
linear algebra, the rows of 𝑀determine a subspace of
ℝ𝑛called its row space. If the row space is 𝑘-dimensional
(the maximum possible), we say that 𝑀has full rank. Two
full-rank matrices 𝑀1 and 𝑀2 have the same row space
if for some 𝐾in the space of 𝑘× 𝑘invertible matrices,
𝐾.𝑀1 = 𝑀2. Clearly, any 𝑘-dimensional subspace of ℝ𝑛
arises as the row space of some full-rank matrix; so the
collection of all 𝑘-dimensional subspaces can be described
as Matfull(𝑘×𝑛)/𝐺𝐿(𝑘). This is the Grassmannian Gr(𝑘, 𝑛).
The next ingredient required to deﬁne the amplituhe-
dron is the notion of positivity in the Grassmannian. A
maximal minor of a matrix 𝑀∈Mat(𝑘× 𝑛) is the deter-
minant of the 𝑘× 𝑘submatrix obtained from taking a
subset of 𝑘of the columns, in the order they appear in
the matrix. The totally positive Grassmannian, denoted
Gr>0(𝑘, 𝑛), is the subspace of the Grassmannian for which
all maximal minors have the same sign. The totally non-
negative Grassmannian, Gr≥0(𝑘, 𝑛), is deﬁned in the same
way, except that we also allow some minors to vanish.
The totally nonnegative Grassmannian was studied by
Postnikov as a concrete instance of Lusztig’s theory of
total positivity for algebraic groups. It is topologically
equivalent to a ball, and has a beautiful cell structure that
can be indexed by decorated permutations (permutations
of 𝑆𝑛with one extra bit of information for each ﬁxed
point). Importantly, cells in this ‘positroid’ stratiﬁcation
can be endowed with cluster coordinates and a natural
volume form.
We now have everything required to deﬁne the tree
amplituhedron. It is indexed by three integers, 𝑛, 𝑘, and
𝑑, and a totally positive 𝑛× (𝑑+ 𝑘) matrix 𝑃. From the
point of view of physics, 𝑛is the number of particles,
𝑘, deﬁned above in the context of graphs, encodes the
total helicity ﬂow, 𝑑is the space-time dimension, and 𝑃
encodes the momenta and helicities of the particles. Let
𝑀∈Gr≥0(𝑘, 𝑛) vary. The amplituhedron 𝒜, as deﬁned
by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka [1] is simply the total image
locus,
(1)
𝒜= 𝑀.𝑃,
inside Gr(𝑘, 𝑑+𝑘). Notice that 𝑀.𝑃is a 𝑘×(𝑑+𝑘) matrix,
automatically having full rank, so 𝑀.𝑃really does deﬁne
a point in Gr(𝑘, 𝑑+ 𝑘).
To help build intuition, it is useful to consider some
special cases. If 𝑛= 𝑑+ 𝑘, then the fact that 𝑃is totally
positive implies it is invertible, so we may as well take it
to be the identity matrix; in this case, the amplituhedron
is simply Gr≥0(𝑘, 𝑑+ 𝑘). Another simple case arises when
𝑘= 1, for which 𝑀is a totally nonnegative 1 × 𝑛matrix—
i.e. a vector of nonnegative numbers, not all zero. In this
case, 𝒜consists of all non-negative linear combinations
of the rows of 𝑃, and is thus a convex polytope in
projective space. The fact that 𝑃is totally positive means
that 𝒜is what is called a cyclic polytope; these have many
interesting extremal properties. In this case, repeatedly
applying the BCFW recursion literally triangulates this
polytope. A point 𝑌in projective space determines a
hyperplane 𝑌∗in the dual projective space, and similarly,
the amplituhedron, being in this case a polytope in
projective space, determines a dual polytope 𝒜∗. The
volume form on 𝒜at a point 𝑌is given by the volume of
𝒜∗when 𝑌∗is the hyperplane at inﬁnity.
In general, the volume form on 𝒜can conjecturally
be deﬁned by the fact that it has logarithmic singular-
ities on the boundaries of 𝒜. It can also be calculated
explicitly by pushing forward the volume form on BCFW
cells. However, it would be desirable to have an explicit,
intrinsic description, as given above for 𝑘= 1. This would
presumably require an answer to the question, “What is
the dual amplituhedron?”—something that we must leave
for the future.
