(In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious,  
the Most Merciful) 
Islam is the divine system of guidance for all human being 
on the earth, and the Prophet, Muhammad (SAW) is the 
universal messenger of Allah (SWT), as revealed in chapter 
34,verse 28 of the Holy Quran.

‚ÄúAnd We (Allah) have not sent you (O Muhammad (SAW)) 
except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner (against sin) 
to all mankind. But most of people know not‚Äù 
Likewise, the book of guidance, al-Quran is a divine 
treasure of knowledge and a universal code of conduct in 
Arabic for salvation of the entire humanity, as revealed in 
the following two verses of the Holy Quran:

Preface 
for the guidance and the criterion (between right  
and wrong)‚Äù. [2/185] 
We can derive benefits from this divine source of 
knowledge and guidance only if we learn the Quranic 
language. It must be clearly understood that reading of 
translation of the Book is, at best, a poor substitute to 
learning the Quranic language. One cannot understand the 
exact meaning and the spirit of the divine revelation 
without understanding the text of the Book. Infact, Allah 
(SWT) has repeatedly stressed on the ponderability of His 
message, which is not possible without having an insight 
knowledge of the language. The following two verses 
necessitate the understanding of the divine message 
directly from the Arabic text.

In truth, it is the ‚ÄòHaq‚Äô (right) of the divine message to be 
recited in the best possible manner, and be understood in 
the right perspective, as has been highlighted in the 
following verse:

‚ÄúThose to whom we have sent the Book recite it (obey its 
orders and follow its teachings) as it should be recited they 
are the ones who believe therein. And those who 
disbelieve in it (the Quran) those are they  
who are the loosers.‚Äù [2/121] 
In this verse the Arabic verb ‚Äòyatlu‚Äô, in fact, cannot be 
translated in one word in any other language, which 
implies ‚Äòrecitation, understanding and obeying‚Äô. This verse 
has emphasized the understanding of the text of the Book 
by the believers, and further added that

‚Äòthey are the ones who (really) believe therein‚Äô, implying 
thereby that, those who do not recite it as it deserves to be 
recited, they do not have sincere faith in the Holy Quran. 
Unfortunately, most of the non-Arab believers, particularly 
the Pakistanis, do not understand the Arabic text of the 
Book.  
It is important for the learner to know that the Arabic is 
very easy to learn as it is a highly sophisticated language 
based on very refined and systematic set of rules and 
patterns. This fact is confirmed by Allah (SWT) in the 
following verse:

Preface 
It is an open challenge for all those who are in search of 
truth. Nevertheless, it does require consistent effort, with a 
sense of purpose and commitment, to attain this most 
important treasure of knowledge for the mankind, and the 
following tradition of the prophet (SAW) rightly accords a 
very high status to the learner of the Holy Quran.

Uthman ibn ‚ÄòAffan (RA) relates that the messenger (SAW) of  
Allah said: ‚ÄúThe best among you  
are those who have learnt the Quran and teach it  
(to others)‚Äú. [Al-Bukhari] 
The aim of this book is to enable the learner to acquire an 
insight knowledge of the Quranic language with a view to 
understanding the text of the Holy Quran. 
In all, this book has 28 lessons. I have tried to make it as 
simple as I could. During the course of study the learner 
should acquire the vocabulary right from the start of the 
book. All the words and phrases used in the lessons should 
be understood and remembered so that he or she can 
muster sufficient vocabulary to enable him or her to 
construct simple phrases and sentences from an early stage 
of the study. Besides, the learner should recite a page or 
two from the Holy Quran regularly, and try to apply the 
grammatical aspects of the language to the verses of the 
Quran as an exercise.

Preface 
The verbal forms and pronouns of Arabic grammar are 
generally considered difficult to understand or remember. 
The learners are advised to concentrate in the beginning 
only on the third person masculine singular and plural 
forms, the second person masculine singular and plural 
forms and both the first person forms in the given tables, 
and skip over the verbal forms and pronouns of the 
feminine gender (except the singular forms) and the dual 
forms 
F
(1];
E
, as these forms are not frequently used in the 
Holy Quran. In the given tables of conjugation I have 
included all the forms of the verbs and the pronouns,  
essentially as ready reckoners for the learners. 
And finally the most important advice to the learner is that 
he or she should seek the guidance and help of Almighty 
Allah through supplications such as:

 I whole-
heartedly thank Muhammad Irshad for the laborious 
work of typesetting, and extend my sincere thanks to 
Ubaid-ur-Rahman for carrying out the strenuous work 
of vetting the book. I am grateful to Zeenat Ullah Khan 
for proof reading of the book, as also Mohsin Manzoor 
Bhatti for his forthcoming assistance. 
I acknowledge with appreciation and thanks the 
contribution made by my wife, Tahira Ahmed, in her 
own domain. And finally I am most grateful to my 
Arabic teachers, including Dr. Idrees Zubair (Al-Huda 
International), Professor Abu Masood Hassan Alvi 
(Islamic Research Academy), Ubaid-ur-Rahman (Vice 
Principal, Institute of Arabic Language), Professor 
Abdus-Sattar (Allama Iqbal Open University), and 
Professor Asma Nadeem (National University of 
Modern Languages), who taught me the language of 
the Glorious Quran. May Allah (SWT) reward them all 
with the highest reward.

nouns mentioned above where certain words have 
neither tanwin nor ‚Äòal‚Äô, yet they are nouns. It should 
be noted that the tanwin and ‚Äòal‚Äô never come 
together on a noun. If ‚Äòal‚Äô comes in the beginning of 
a noun then its case-ending will be single vowel, 
not tanwin, e.g.. it may be

An Explanation Regarding Exceptional Cases:
Here, I would like to clarify an important point regarding 
the exceptional cases in the grammatical rules. The learner 
should be mindful of the fact that the languages have not 
come into being through an academic process based on 
some predetermined sets of grammatical rules and forms 
but, on the contrary, the languages are spoken by the 
natives of the region long before the grammarians form the 
grammatical rules applicable to them. And the object of 
framing grammatical rules is essentially to facilitate the 
learning and better understanding of the languages by the 
non-natives or the foreigners. But, where they fail to apply 
uniform sets of grammatical rules, they categorize that as 
exceptional case. Hence, the exception-rule is a common 
feature to all the languages. Having said that, I must hasten 
to emphasis that the grammarians of Arabic language have 
contributed tremendously in facilitating the learning 
process of the language. In fact, they have developed an 
easy and effective method of learning the classic Arabic of 
the Holy Quran. Hence, their efforts cannot be undermined 
in any way.

THE IRAB OF NOUN    
 
The Irab of words is a peculiar characteristic of Arabic 
language, which does not have an equivalent in English. 
Therefore, it requires particular attention to grasp the 
subject. The Arabic noun changes its original form or the 
case ending under different grammatical conditions, e.g. 

GA¬õ+# ◊êbeing the original form in nominative case, called _(#
R¬ÇŸí># ,◊êmay change to GA¬õ+# ,◊êthe accusative case, called _(#

called RSLW( @R◊ê

It is important to remember that the literal meaning of the 
words/nouns remain the same in all the different 
conditions; however, their function in a sentence changes 
according to the different grammatical considerations, 
which are explained later in the book.  
This change/declension in Irab is effected in two ways as 
explained below:

The Relative Phrase 
Since the pronouns are indeclinable

their original form even as G#@ 97! ;◊êhowever, they are 
considered in genitive place 
F)
e¬Éi¬§){
ŸàE
. 
The suffix of the first person singular is 
‚Äô
B
‚Äò
 (ya) and not  
(ni), e.g. 
K


, not 

K
1
 (as attached to verbs). If the 
final letter of the word is a xI	b F3E  then it can be absorbed, 
e.g. BH¬ç for B3H¬ç ‚Äòmy wrong action‚Äô; B( b◊êfor B3 )b◊ê
‚Äòmy love/wish‚Äô. 
The nominal suffix 
‚Äô
B
‚Äò
 is sometimes shortened into ‚Äì (i) 
particularly when the noun to which it is attached is in 
vocative, e.g. 
  (for 
H

) which has the meaning ‚ÄòO my 
Lord!‚Äô as opposed to 

  ‚Äòmy Lord‚Äô, similarly, R‚Äò H/ŸÖO my 
people!‚Äô as opposed to )/ ‚Äòmy people‚Äô. 
The dammah in A
G, 	
b, S

b is changed into kasra after ‚Äì ,

 ‚Äòin their

>
K

	R
 ‚Äòin the two books of the two of them‚Äô. 
However, if no ambiguity of meaning can arise, the dual 
before a dual suffix is replaced by a singular mudaf, i.e. 
	

K ‚Äòthe book of them both‚Äô or the plural

K_

E:Ÿí#◊êE
, e.g.

 of 
the verb. The fa‚Äôil is always in the nominative case 
(marfu ‚Äì e .))>_ÿπThe fa‚Äôil can be a pronoun also, e.g.

The Verbal Sentence  
 
E ÿØhas no waw at the end because  ÿØ+_◊êmeans ‚Äòthey 
entered‚Äô; and if we say 
Vi¬è¬ç# ÿØ+_◊ê◊êit means ‚Äòthey the 
students entered‚Äô. This is not correct because there 
cannot be two fa‚Äôils for a verb. But we can say 
Vi¬è¬ç#◊ê
 ÿØ+_◊êwhich becomes a nominal sentence. Here 
i¬ç# ◊ê
is the mubtada and the sentence  ÿØ+_◊êis the khabar.  
 
The same rule applies to the third person feminine, e.g.

‚Äò the girls entered‚Äô or TŸí+ .◊ê#Ÿíg1O

 and the object

accusative case

. However, this sequence is altered 
when the subject or the object needs emphasis or it is to be 
focused. Such changes can be as follows: 
‚Äì Sometimes the object follows the verb in the form of a 
pronoun and the subject comes after the object, e.g. 
Ô¥ø

E:#◊êE

e):Ÿí"
ŸÑ
GE
. So, 
here the sequence is: verb+object+subject and the 
stress is on the object ‚ÄôAG‚Äò
 (referring to Yaqub œÖ).  
‚Äì Another example: 
Ô¥ø
@Rÿ∞
7H"*_◊ê#Ÿí	O
Ô¥æ
‚Äú When death

verse is: verb

F

. 
In this verse the object followed the verb in the form of 
a proper noun 
S+"# ,◊êand the subject came afterwards. 
Here again the stress is on the object i.e. Yaqub (œÖ). 
‚Äì Sometimes the object precedes both the verb and the 
subject, e.g.  
%
g" UHR@ ‚ÄúYou (alone) we worship‚Äù [the 
Quran] (
R@H
U  is the object and 
"
g
%
 is verb + subject). In 
this verse also the stress and focus is on the ‚Äòobject‚Äô that 
we worship no other but Thee (Allah) and Thee alone. 
Similarly, 
T"K. UHR@‚Äú Ÿàand You (Allah alone) we ask 
for help (for each and everything)‚Äù. [the Quran].

The difference between the verbal and the nominal 
sentences is that the verbal sentence relates to an act or 
event whereas the nominal sentence gives a description of 
a person or a thing, and it brings the subject 
F
%Kg!◊êE
 into 
focus, and often lays emphasis on the subject. A verbal 
sentence can be changed into a nominal one, e.g.  



_$◊ê
ŸÜ  , ◊ê#Ÿí
‚Äò Allah created the universe‚Äô. This is a verbal 
sentence narrating a simple fact. However, if the emphasis 
is to be laid on the subject that no one else but Allah alone 
has created the universe, then a nominal sentence is used, 
e.g.

The Imperfect Tense 
 The first letter (radical fa) of all the forms 
F
h(
E
 is made 
sakin, e.g. the madi <K means ‚Äòhe wrote‚Äô and the 
radical fa in this verb is U which is to become ŸíU (sakin).  
 The last radical i.e. radical lam is to be given a 
dammah. In this example, the radical lam is , which is 
to become 
.  
 As for the middle radical 
F
(	+,Ÿí#T
◊êE
 the vowel can be 
fath 
F
e¬ÅK>
E
, kasrah

 or dammah

	?
h(E
. As a 
general rule if the middle radical of the madi has 
kasrah, its corresponding middle letter (	+,Ÿí# T
 ◊êof 
mudare is with fath 
F
e¬ÅK>
E
, e.g.  
‚Äì The mudare of RC ‚Äòhe drank‚Äô is

tŸí:H. However, <. is an 
exception; its mudare is 
<.¬ÉH. This exceptional 
pattern is rarely used.  
 
If the middle letter in the madi has dammah on it, the 
corresponding middle radical in the mudare is also with 
dammah, e.g. M

has fath then the corresponding (	+,#  ◊êin the mudare 
may be fatha, kasrah or dammah. There is no definite 
pattern to determine this vowel. It comes through 
practice or with consultation of dictionary, e.g. ¬ÅK> 

The Imperfect Tense 
To sum up; if the middle letter of the perfect has 
dammah the middle letter of the imperfect is likewise. If 
the middle letter of the perfect has a kasrah then the 
middle radical of the imperfect is fathah. However, 
<. is an exception; its imperfect is 
<.¬ÉH. But if the 
middle letter of the perfect has a fathah then vowel of 
the middle radical of the imperfect can only be 
determined 
through 
practice 
or 
by 
consulting 
dictionary.

, and it undergoes 
changes to indicate its functions in the sentences. Just as 
the noun has three cases i.e. marfu (nominative), mansub 
(accusative) and majrur (genitive), the mudare also has 
three case endings, which are called ‚Äòmoods‚Äô in English. 
These are marfu, mansub and majzum ‚Äòjussive‚Äô (vowelless 
or sakun). However, the mudare is mabni to the pronoun 
of second and third person feminine plural. Remember that 
the noun never has

which are less common. As for the mujarrad verbs (thalathi

the meanings of these verbs. So the thalathi mujarrad, 
found on 
9
KÿπKŸÑ
 and rubai mujarrad based on

 ,are 
the original forms of verb. Apart from the original form, 
there is a Derived Verbal Form which is called G>e%HRI)eE"> 
(mazid fihi). In this lesson we will learn about the Derived 
Forms of the Verbs.  
The derived verbs are made up from the triliteral and 
quadrilateral verbal form by the addition of prefixes, 
suffixes and infixes. Through these modifications the vari-
ation in the shade of meaning is determined. Each of these 
modified forms is called a bab (

abwab). In all, there are about fifteen abwab of mazid 
verbs, of which we will learn here some of the important 
ones used in the Quran. And the first bab of the mazid verb 
that we are going to learn in some detail is, fa‚Äô‚Äôla

(bab fa‚Äô‚Äôla)
(bab fa‚Äô‚Äôla):::: In this bab the 
second radical of the thalathi mujarrad verb E"> is doubled, 
e.g. from ‚Äò ÿØÿ≥he studied‚Äô to ‚Äò ÿØÿ≥he taught‚Äô, ? ‚Äòhe beat‚Äô 
 ? ‚Äòhe beat violently‚Äô. It is conjugated the same way as 
a simple four-letter verb i.e.  ,ÿØLK ,ÿØLz ,ÿØL
◊ê ,ÿØL ,ÿØÿ≥
 .‚Ä¶ÿØLT
As for the meaning and application of the Form-I E">, it 
often indicates the act being intensive or extensive, e.g. the 
simple form EK/ means ‚Äòhe killed‚Äô, but EK/ means ‚Äòhe 
massacred‚Äô, and the simple verbal sentence Ÿã_ . 
means ‚Äòhe broke a glass‚Äô, but Ÿã_ . means ‚Äòhe 
smashed a glass‚Äô, and 9y means ‚Äòhe went round‚Äô, but 
9y means ‚Äòhe went round often or many times‚Äô. 
Another meaning and application of the Form I is doing 
something to another, i.e. the intransitive verb

changed to the transitive

reached me‚Äô i.e. I am impressed by your talk. But ¬ØV+ means 
‚Äòhe delivered/conveyed‚Äô, e.g.  K#L zV+ Eb ‚Äòdid you 
deliver my message‚Äô.

123 
The Derived Verbal Form-I 
This particular form of verb is also often used in an action 
requiring/involving special arrangements, emphasis and 
graduality, e.g. from a simple trilateral verb S+ ‚Äòhe knew‚Äô 
to SV+ ‚Äòhe taught‚Äô i.e. teaching is a gradual process over a 
period of time, involving a teacher and class management. 
Similarly, I
‚Äò  ŸÑhe descended (himself)‚Äô is an intransitive 
verb involving ones own self, i.e., it does not have a direct 
object. But ‚Äò IŸÑhe made it/him to descend‚Äô, has a direct 
object, 3	.#‚Äò IŸÑ◊ê$_)¬ç◊êŸã)T◊êAllah descended rain (water) 
from the sky‚Äô. Since descending of rain entails an elaborate 
process, hence the verb used for it is E"> which 
encompasses all the process involved in falling of rain. 
Similarly ‚Äò IŸÑ◊ê$_◊ê#Ÿí*_ŸÜAllah descended the Quran‚Äô.  
It may be born in mind that it is just not possible to 
translate many such forms of Arabic words in one word in 
any other language. This is the reason that understanding of 
Arabic language is inevitable for understanding the Quran 
and the Hadith, for such like fine variations in the 
meanings and application of Arabic words do not exist in 
any of the other living languages. Hence, reading of 
translation of the Quran in any other language can never 
convey the true spirit, meaning and connotations of the 
Quranic verses.

In the study of verbs we have learnt that most of the Arabic 
verbs have only three letters which are called radicals. The 
first radical is called 
‚Äô
9
‚Äò
 (fa), the second is called ‚Äô(  ‚Äòÿπain), 
and the third letter is called 
‚ÄôŸÑ‚Äò
( lam). These names are 
taken from the verb E"> which is used as a reference-
pattern for all the verbs. We should now understand that 
from the classification point of view, the Arabic verb is 
divided into the following four categories:

<b‚Äò Ÿàhe granted‚Äô, .H ‚Äòhe facilitated/made easy‚Äô. 
 
Unlike the sound verbs, there is an abnormality in 
the mudare of the mithal verbs. In this case the first 
radical waw in the mithal perfect verb is lost in the 
mudare, e.g. the mudare of E Ÿàis 
EPH, which is 
originally 
EH like ?  
R7H, and after 
omission of the waw it becomes 
EPH. The amr from 

EPH is E which is based on two letters only. No 
hamzat al-wasl is needed at the beginning as the 
verb already commences with a consonant with 
vowel. By making the last radical sakin, the amr 
from 
EPH is formed as E ‚Äòarrive‚Äô.

If a verb has two identical consonants as its second and 
third radicals, it is called the Muda‚Äôaf (duplicate), e.g. %) 
(originally ‚Äò ))%ÿØto extend‚Äô, ) (for )) ‚Äòto pass‚Äô, SC (for 
S	C) ‚Äòto smell‚Äô, ¬¨ (for ¬¨{) ‚Äòto perform Haj/pilgrimage‚Äô. 
Unlike English where double letters are written separately, 
as is ‚Äòn‚Äô in ‚Äòconnect‚Äô and ‚Äòr‚Äô in irregular, in Arabic double 
consonants can be assimilated with a shaddah sign 
F_QQQQE
 
above it, e.g. in ( )%ÿØmadada), the two dals are assimilated 
and written as %) (madda). Similarly, ) (marara) becomes 
) (marra), S	C (shamama) becomes SC (shamma) and ¬¨{ 
(hajaja) becomes ¬¨ (hajja).  
In muda‚Äôaf verbs, the second radical loses its vowel when 
the verb is isnaded (conjugated) to the sakin pronouns, 
such as z{,  .¬¨ ,{◊êBut it retains its vowel when the 
verb is conjugated to the mutaharrik pronouns as; T{{,

conjugation to the mutaharrik pronouns, e.g. T{
{¬ÉH, 
T{
{¬É;.  
In mudare majzum the muda‚Äôaf verb undergoes a change 
in the vowel of the last radical in respect of the following 
four forms: ¬¨
¬ÉHS#, ¬¨
¬É;S#, ¬¨
S#, ¬¨
¬ÉS#. In these forms 
 1.# ◊ê#K*3 ◊êoccurs in the last two radicals making it 
unreadable because both the second and the third radical 
have no vowel (lam ya-hujj), and none of the two can be 
omitted being strong letters. Therefore, the third radical 
takes a fathah to remove  1.# .◊ê#K*3◊êThus the mudare 
majzum in these four forms is read as follows:  
¬¨
¬É;S# ‚Äòyou didn‚Äôt perform Hajj‚Äô, ¬¨
¬ÉHS#‚Äòhe didn‚Äôt perform 
Hajj‚Äô, ¬¨
 S# ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt perform Hajj‚Äô, ¬¨
¬É S# ‚Äòwe didn‚Äôt 
perform Hajj‚Äô. 
There is no  1.# ◊ê#K*3 ◊êinvolved in other form of the 
muda‚Äôaf, hence the remaining forms are read on the 
standard pattern of mudare majzum, e.g. ‚Äò #S;¬É
{◊êyou (‚ôÇ 
all) did not perform Hajj‚Äô, ‚Äò #SH¬É
{◊êthey did not perform 
Hajj‚Äô, Q{
¬É;S# ‚Äòyou (‚ôÄ sing.) did not perform Hajj‚Äô 
However,  1.# ◊ê#K*3 ◊êalso occurs in the formation of 
the amr (imperative). After removing the  9 ◊ê!7ÿπand 
the final dammah from ¬¨
¬É; what remains is Q¬¨
 (hajj), 
therefore, the third radical takes fathah to remove  3*K#◊ê
 .◊ê#.1 So the amr becomes ¬¨
 (hujja) without hamzat 
al-wasl.

If the verb is of i-a group like SC (for S	C) and 0) (for 
0.)) the kasrah of the second radical appears and the 
assimilation is removed when the verb is conjugated to the 
mutaharrik pronouns, e.g. S[H SC because

The different categories of verbs used in Arabic language 
are consolidated in table 26. it may be noted by the learner 
that the forms of verbs that are mentioned in this table are 
in actual usable forms. The changes that these verbs have 
undergone may not be of importance to every learner. As 
far as a common learner of Arabic is concerned, it may be 
sufficient for him/her to know the usable forms of these 
verbs, i.e.: 
‚Äò /ŸÑhe said‚Äô is perfect, 
‚Äò H*_ŸÑhe says‚Äô is imperfect in 
nominative case, E_/ ‚Äòsay, tell‚Äô is imperative, ‚Äò #TH*_ŸÑhe will 
never say‚Äô is imperfect in accusative case, E_*HS# ‚Äòhe did not

In fact, the process of changes mentioned in chapters 25 
and 26 are essentially of academic interest, hence the 
learner should not be discouraged if he/she finds the 
process rather complicated or incomprehensible. In reality, 
Arabic is highly sophisticated language encompassing 
almost unlimited scope and tremendous precision.  By and 
large, it follows a very scientific and systematic patterns 
which makes it easy to learn and understand. Most of the 
verbs belong to the category of sound verbs, i.e. ◊ê>"ŸÑ

The cardinal numbers, in Arabic, are governed by a set of 
rules. In general terms they are treated as the declinable 
nouns, as their ending vowels are changed according to 
their case-endings. The cardinal numbers from one to ten 
are listed below both for masculine (‚ôÇ)and feminine (‚ôÄ).

CONCLUSION     
 
In conclusion, this book covers the essential aspects of the 
Quranic grammar, which should enable the learner to 
follow the Arabic text of the Holy Quran. However, he 
would require assistance of an authentic Quranic 
dictionary to learn the meanings and application of 
unfamiliar words and phrases. The book should also form a 
sound base for those who desire to pursue higher studies in 
Arabic.  
This book is an extension of my lectures on the subject in 
Urdu language (www.sautulquran.org/CD). It is written 
essentially on the request of some persons who desired to 
learn the Quranic language, but they did not find the study 
material in English language. I was fully conscious of my 
own limitations to undertake such a sensitive and complex 
task, but I ventured to do so primarily in the background of 
the saying of our beloved Prophet (SAW)

. I 
have tried to convey to others whatever little knowledge of 
the subject that I had with a view to contributing, in a 
humble way, towards the promotion of the Quranic 
learning. Any views, comments or suggestions for improve-
ment of the next addition would be welcomed and highly 
appreciated.

Conclusion 
May Allah Almighty forgive me for the shortcomings in the 
book, and May He help and guide the learners in under-
standing and practicing the Quranic teachings (Amin).  
My sincere thanks to all those who assisted me in the 
accomplishment of this work. May Allah (SWT) bless them 
and May He reward them for their contribution (Amin).
