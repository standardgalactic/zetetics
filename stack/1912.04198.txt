Abstract:
We review Lie polynomials as a mathematical framework that underpins the
structure of the so-called double copy relationship between gauge and gravity theories (and
a network of other theories besides). We explain how Lie polynomials naturally arise in the
geometry and cohomology of M0,n, the moduli space of n points on the Riemann sphere up
to Mobi¨us transformation. We introduce a twistorial correspondence between the cotangent
bundle T ∗
DM0,n, the bundle of forms with logarithmic singularities on the divisor D as the
twistor space, and Kn the space of momentum invariants of n massless particles subject to
momentum conservation as the analogue of space-time. This gives a natural framework for
Cachazo He and Yuan (CHY) and ambitwistor-string formulae for scattering amplitudes of
gauge and gravity theories as being the corresponding Penrose transform. In particular we
show that it gives a natural correspondence between CHY half-integrands and scattering
forms, certain n −3-forms on Kn, introduced by Arkani-Hamed, Bai, He and Yan (ABHY).
We also give a generalization and more invariant description of the associahedral n−3-planes
in Kn introduced by ABHY.

Introduction
Color-kinematics duality and the double copy [1, 2] have had a powerful inﬂuence on recent
developments in scattering amplitudes. They stem from the KLT relations in string theory
[3] between gravity and Yang-Mills tree-amplitudes and have been devloped as a tool for
the study of multiloop gravity amplitudes and more recently for applications to perturbative
classical gravity calculations in connection with gravitational waves [4]. Notwithstanding the
physical applications, the underlying mathematical framework is perhaps rather surprising
even at tree level. There is little hint of such a double copy structure in standard approaches
to perturbation theory of the classical nonlinear theories involved. The purpose of this article
is to develop some of the underpinning mathematical structures. We build on observations
by Kapranov in an after dinner talk [5] concerning the relevance of Lie polynomials, both
in the double copy and in the Parke-Taylor expressions that pervade the subject. We also
– 1 –

build on the recent work by Arkani-Hamed, Bai, He and Yan [6] that introduces diﬀerential
forms in the space of kinematic invariants, Kn. We tie them together by means of a double
ﬁbration correspondence that leads to a Penrose-like transform for the formulae of Cachazo
He and Yuan (CHY) arising from the scattering equations [7, 8].
The ﬁrst section provides an elementary review of the theory of Lie polynomials as rele-
vant to this topic, and expresses standard facts about the double copy in this language. In
particular, the trivalent diagrams of BCJ are a representation of elements Γ ∈Lie(n −1),
the space of Lie polynomials of degree n −1, and BCJ numerators NΓ are homomorphisms
N : Lie(n −1) →V where V is some vector space of polynomials in the polarization data
and momenta.
We next review the role played by Lie polynomials in the geometry of the moduli
space M0,n of n points σi in CP1, both in describing the compact cycles in the homol-
ogy Hn−3(M0,n −D), which is isomorphic to Lie(n −1), and dually the relative cocycles in
Hn−3(M0,n, D), represented by the top degree holomorphic Parke-Taylor forms.
With these preliminaries in hand, we study a double ﬁbration between the space of
Mandelstam variables, Kn, and T ∗

(1.2)
which give the left hand side of the scattering equations.
In the language of this corre-
spondence, the CHY formulae are a Penrose transform, being simply the push down of the
pullback of certain forms on T. We investigate other more geometrical aspects of the Penrose
transform. In particular we show that the top power of the symplectic form ωn−3 provides a
correspondence between certain (n −3)-forms wΓ on Kn that were introduced by ABHY and
homology classes in M0,n. ABHY use the wΓ as numerators so that given a set of conventional
numerators N one can associate a scattering (n −3)-form ΩN. These arise from our double
ﬁbration via a Penrose transform also. Dually, ABHY introduce associahedral (n −3)-planes
in Kn that can be used to convert a scattering form into a conventional amplitude. We give
an improved and extended deﬁnition of these, and show how they tie into the geometry of
the correspondence.

The double copy and Lie polynomials
Colour structures for n-point amplitudes are degree n invariant polynomials of weight one
in each of the n Lie algebra ‘colours’ of the external particles.
These naturally arise in
– 2 –

Feynman rules as trivalent Feynman diagrams whose vertices are the structure constants of
some unspeciﬁed Lie algebra. If we ﬁx the nth particle, and an invariant inner product on the
Lie algebra, at tree-level, such a polynomial can be realized as the inner product of the nth
colour with the Lie algebra element with a Lie polynomial formed by successive commutators
of the n−1 other colours working through the diagram back from the nth particle. This section
reviews material concerning such colour structures in the language of free Lie algebras and
Lie polynomials together with their duality with words formed from permutations of the n−1
labels of the ﬁrst n −1 external particles. A classic text on free Lie algebras is [9].
2.1
A review of words, Lie polynomials and trees
The space of words, W(n −1), is the (n −1)!-dimensional linear span of words
a = xa(1)xa(2) . . . xa(n−1),
where the letters xa(i) ∈{x1, . . . , xn−1} are all distinct, so that the a’s deﬁne permutations
on n −1 letters. There is a natural bilinear inner product on W(n −1) that is deﬁned on
monomials a and b by
(a, b) :=
n−1
Y
i=1
δa(i)b(i),
i.e., (a, b) is 1 if a and b are the same word, and 0 otherwise. A ‘Lie polynomial’ in W(n −1)
is any expression formed by taking n −2 iterated commutators of the xi. An example is
Γ = [x1, [..., [xn−1, xn]...]] + [xn, [..., [xn−2, xn−1]...]],
where [xi, xj] is the commutator, xixj−xjxi. Let Lie(n−1) be the linear subspace of W(n−1)
generated by all Lie polynomials Γ of weight n −1 in the n −1 variables, x1, ..., xn−1, with
weight one in each. Every Lie monomial Γ deﬁnes a rooted trivalent tree decorated by an
orientation. We denote this tree also by Γ. An orientation of the tree can be presented as a
planar embedding, where two planar embeddings have the same orientation if they diﬀer from
one another by an even number of ﬂips. Thus, for example, the monomial Γ = [2, [[1, 3], [5, 4]]]
is associated with the following two planar embeddings, amoung others.

We will denote three Lie polynomials or corresponding graphs that diﬀer only on such a
four point subgraph by Γs, Γt and Γu, and we will consequently have
Γs + Γt + Γu = 0.
(2.1)
The Lie monomial notation is useful for keeping track of the orientations of trees. Recall the
inner product ( , ) deﬁned on words. For a Lie monomial Γ, (Γ, a) is the coeﬃcient of a in
the expansion of its Lie monomial Γ. When Γ is not planar for the ordering a, (Γ, a) = 0.
When Γ is planar for the ordering a, (Γ, a) is the orientation of that planar embedding, either
+1 or −1. As an application of the notation we can write
Γ =
X
a
(Γ, a)a ,
(2.2)
which is simply the expansion of the commutators in Γ.
There are many characterizations of Lie(n −1) as a subspace of W(n −1) [9], and some
of these have long been known in the physics literature as relations amoung gauge theory tree
amplitudes. For instance, the U(1) decoupling identity is a consequence of Ree’s theorem.
Proposition 2.1 (Ree [10]) A polynomial w ∈W[n−1] is a Lie polynomial iﬀ(w, ab) = 0
for all nontrivial shuﬄes a  b.1
This proposition implies that Lie(n −1)∗, the dual vector space of Lie(n −1), can be under-
stood as the quotient vector space W(n −1)/Sh, where Sh is the subspace generated by all
nontrivial shuﬄes.
Lemma 2.2 (Radford [11]) The (n −2)! words of the form 1a are a basis for Lie(n −1)∗.
The direct expansion of Γ1a into words is
Γ1a =
X
a∈¯uv
(−1)|u|u1v ,
(2.3)
where |u| is the length of u. It follows that
(Γ1a, 1b) = (a, b).
In other words, we have the following.
Lemma 2.3 The Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) basis of Lie(n −1)∗given by words 1a is dual to the
DDM basis of Lie(n −1) given by combs Γ1a.
1The shuﬄe product of a and b, a  b, is the sum over ordered permutations of the letters of a and b that
preserve the orderings of the letters in a and b.
– 4 –

An immediate consequence of this Lemma is that any b+Sh ∈W(n−1)/Sh may be expanded
in this basis as
b + Sh =
X
a
(Γ1a, b)1a + Sh.
(2.4)
Dually, given that the combs are a basis for Lie(n −1), a polynomial w is a Lie polynomial
iﬀthere is an expansion of w in the combs Γ1a. Using Lemma 2.3, we ﬁnd that
w =
X
(w, 1a)Γ1a.
(2.5)
By equation (2.3), we ﬁnd that
w =
X
(w, 1(¯u  v))(−1)|u|u1v ,
where ¯u is the reversal of u. This identity implies the Kleiss-Kuijf relations, which we can
restate as a theorem about Lie polynomials.
Proposition 2.4 (Kleiss-Kuijf) A polynomial w ∈W[n −1] is a Lie polynomial iﬀthe
Kleiss-Kuijf relations [12] hold:
(w, a1b) = (−1)|a|(w, 1¯a  b) ,
(2.6)
.
2.2
The geometry of Kn
The space of Mandelstam variables is Kn ≃Rn(n−3)/2. In coordinates sij, i, j = 1, . . . , n (with
sij = sji, sii = 0), Kn is the hyperplane given by the equations
n
X
j=1
sij = 0.
(2.7)
For amplitudes, the key geometric structure in Kn are the factorization hyperplanes given by
sI = 0, where I ⊂{1, 2, . . . , n} and
sI :=
X
i,j∈I
sij =
 X
i
ki
!2
.
(2.8)
Let ¯I be the complement of I, so that s¯I = −sI by (2.7). Locality states that the only
singularities of tree amplitudes are simple poles on these hyperplanes. A further requirement
is that a double pole on the intersection of sI = 0 and sJ = 0 occurs in an amplitude only if
I ⊂J or ¯J. It follows that the allowed pole structure of a contribution to an n-point amplitude
has poles along at most n −3 factorization hyperplanes sIp = 0 for p = 1, . . . , n −3. Such
choices are in one-to-one correspondence with trivalent (and unoriented) trees.

2.3
The double copy from biadjoint scalars to gauge and gravity theories
The double copy principle is that massless n-point tree amplitudes for a large web of important
theories, including many gauge and gravity theories, can be expressed as a double copy in
the form
M =
X
Γ
NΓ ˜NΓ
dΓ
.
(2.9)
Here the denominators
dΓ =
n−3
Y
r=1
sIr
(2.10)
are the propagator factors associated to the graph Γ thought of as a Feynman graph. Further,
each trivalent diagram Γ has a pair of numerator factors NΓ and ˜NΓ that are functions of
momenta, polarization data, ﬂavour and colour. Such factors are said to be local if they are
polynomial, i.e., admit no spurious singularities.
The key additional feature required to be a BCJ numerator is that NΓ and ˜NΓ should
represent homomorphisms from Lie polynomials to some vector space V of functions,
N : Lie(n −1) →V.
(2.11)
Thus for any three graphs Γs, Γt and Γu satisfying Γs + Γt + Γu = 0 as Lie polynomials, we
must also have that
NΓs + NΓt + NΓu = 0 .
(2.12)
For this reason, the numerators are not uniquely determined: given a triple Γs, Γt and Γu we
can perform the shift δ(NΓs, NΓt, NΓu) = (s, t, u)A for any A ∈V . It also follows that BCJ
numerators can be determined from their values on a comb basis NΓ1a by
NΓ =
X
a
(Γ, 1a)NΓ1a .
(2.13)
In the case of Yang mills, the claim of BCJ [1] is that
A =
X
Γ
Nk,ϵ
Γ cΓ
dΓ
(2.14)
for some kinematic numerators Nk,ϵ
Γ
depending linearly on each polarization vector ϵi and
rationally (or even polynomially) on the momenta satisfying (2.12). The key nontrivial output
of the double copy is that gravity amplitudes are obtained when ˜NΓ = Nk,ϵ
Γ .
The same
numerators determine both the colour-ordered Yang-Mills amplitude with order a is then
Aa =
X
Γ
NΓ(Γ, a)
dΓ
(2.15)
and gravity amplitudes by
M =
X
Γ
NΓNΓ
dΓ
.
(2.16)
– 6 –

The most basic theory in this framework is the bi-adjoint scalar theory whose colour ordered
amplitudes are given by
m(a, b) :=
X
Γ
(Γ, a)(Γ, b)
dΓ
.
(2.17)
and we can introduce two underlying abstract amplitudes for these theories given by
m =
X
Γ
Γ ⊗Γ
dΓ
∈Lie(n −1) ⊗Lie(n −1) ,
m(a) =
X
Γ
(Γ, a)Γ
dΓ
∈Lie(n −1).
(2.18)
Substituting (2.13) into (2.15) we obtain Yang-Mills amplitudes in terms of numerators and
m(a, b) by
Aa = (N, m(a)) =
X
b
m(a, 1b)Nk,ϵ
Γ1b ,
(2.19)
with a similar form for gravity
M = (N ⊗˜N, m) =
X
a,b
m(1a, 1b)Nk,ϵ
1a ˜Nk,˜ϵ
1b .
(2.20)
We brieﬂy remark that the basic kinematic numerators Nk,ϵ
Γ
for Yang Mills were obtained
in [13] and other related ones such as Nk,k
Γ
can be created by setting ki·ϵj = 0, and ϵi·ϵj = ki·kj
or Nϵ,k,m
Γ
by taking some components of the polarization vectors to be in a higher dimension
to the momenta. We thereby obtain, amplitudes for a variety of theories as

We cannot simply invert (2.19) to obtain the N1b as m(1a, 1b) is not invertible. Indeed,
all theories that can be expressed in this double-copy format with one explicit Lie polynomial
factor satisfy the fundamental BCJ relations [1]. There are many forms of the relations, one
version being, for a word2 a ∈W(n −2)
X
bc=a
si,b|b|m((i  b)c) = 0 , where
sb,k :=
|b|
X
i=1
sbi k .
(2.21)
Thus (2.19) determines the N1a only up to the addition of multiples of the BCJ relations.
This freedom can be used to set all but (n −3)! of the N1a to zero, but this is at the expense
of requiring numerators that are rational rather than polynomial in the momenta, so that the
remaining numerators will then have spurious poles.

A note on the Kinematic Algebra
Given a Lie algebra, g, with an inner product, a Lie monomial Γ ∈Lie(n −1) gives rise to a
‘colour factor,’ cΓ, for every n-tuple of Lie algebra elements, T1, ..., Tn,
cΓ := tr(Γ[T1, ..., Tn−1]Tn).
This means we have a map
c : Lie(n −1) →⊗ng∗,
and it is a homomorphism, since the cΓ clearly satisfy the Jacobi identity. The BCJ kinematic
numerators for Yang-Mills, Nk,ϵ
Γ , likewise satisfy the Jacobi identity leading to a suggestion
that they might arise from some kinematic algebra, an as yet unideintiﬁed Lie algebra. If that
were the case, the double copy would be replacing the Yang-Mills Lie algebra numerator cΓ
with kinematic numerators Nk,ϵ
Γ . However (2.12) does not imply that there is a Lie algebra,
g, such that NΓ is the colour factor for that Lie algebra. This is clear for example in the case
of (Γ, a) (and the forms wΓ below). Nevertheless, there has been some interesting work to
identify such a Lie algebra associated to the kinematic numerators, [15–17], (2.12).
In general, a homomorphism from Lie(n −1) to a vector space of functions can be given
by choosing any (n −2)! such functions, as in equation (2.13). These have been identiﬁed
in the case of Yang-Mills by various authors by recursion and in particular for Yang Mills in
[13].

Trees and words in M0,n
In this section we consider the homology and cohomology of M0,n, the Deligne-Mumford
compactiﬁcation of the space of n distinct points on the Riemann sphere CP1 up to M¨obius
transformations. We ﬁrst recall the basic properties of M0,n. M0,n has a normal crossing
divisor D, whose top dimensional strata are the codimension one components DI, for I ⊂
{1, ..., n}, where the points in I bubble oﬀonto a new CP1, attached to the ﬁrst by a node.
2This is eq 3.8 of [14] together with the use of the U(1)-decoupling identity in the bracketed term.
– 8 –

I
¯I
Two such components, DI and DJ, intersect iﬀI ⊂J or I ⊂¯J. Then DI ∩DJ corresponds
to nodal curves with 3 components; for example when I ⊂J, one containing the points I, the
second J −I and the third ¯J. It follows that the maximal intersections of these DI are points,
DΓ ∈M0,n, given by the intersection of n−3 compatible DIp. Each such point correspond to
a nodal curve with n −3 components, each with three points that are either nodes or marked
points. Such a tuple of compatible sets Ip deﬁnes a trivalent tree, Γ, with the components
corresponding to the vertices and nodes to propagators. The 0-dimensional strata of D are
thus in one-to-one correspondence with trivalent (and unoriented) trees.
The complement of the divisor in M0,n is an open top cell, M#
0,n := M0,n−D, on which we
can use simplicial coordinates σi, i = 1, ..., n, with the gauge ﬁxing (σ1, σn−1, σn) = (0, 1, ∞).
However, in order to study M0,n in the neighborhood of the divisor, it is useful to introduce
dihedral coordinates, which are a set of cross-ratios of the points. There is one such set of
coordinates for every dihedral structure [18]. Given an ordering, a, the associated dihedral
coordinates are the cross-ratios
uij := (aiaj−1|ai−1aj) = σai aj−1σai−1 aj
σaiajσai−1 aj−1
,
(3.1)
for 1 < i + 1 < j and σij = σi −σj. Each such cross-ratio uij is associated to the cord,
(ai, aj+1), of the n-gon labelled by the ordering, a. We will also denote uij by uI, where
I ⊂{1, ..., n} is the subset {ai, ..., aj−1} or its complement.
If the ordering a is compatible with the set I ⊂{1, ..., n}, then the divisor component
DI can be seen in these coordinates as the locus of uI = 0 [18]. The points DΓ in the divisor
are, in dihedral coordinates, given as follows. Choose any ordering a such that Γ is planar for
a (i.e. (Γ, a) ̸= 0), with propogators given by the subsets Ip ⊂{1, ..., n −1}. In the dihedral
coordinates associated to a, there are n −3 cross-ratios uIp corresponding to the propogators
of Γ. The point DΓ is then given, in these coordinates, by uIp = 0 for all p = 1, ..., n −3.
The uIp form a good set of coordinates near Γ. Relations between such coordinate systems
near diﬀerent such points are obtained from the non-crossing identity
uij = 1 −
Y
(k,l)∈(i,j)c
ukl ,
(3.2)
where for k < l, (k, l) ∈(i, j)c means that the diagonal (k, l) of the polygon with vertices
{1, . . . , n} crosses the diagonal (i, j).

The cohomology of M0,n and Parke-Taylors

P(t) :=
X
i
dim(Hi(M#
0,n)) ti =

Y
k=2
(1 + kt) .
(3.3)
The cohomology ring is generated by the d log σij in the standard gauge ﬁxing, subject to
the quadratic relations

(3.4)
This gives the dimension of Γ(Ω1
D) as Pn−2
k=2 = n(n −3)/2 as claimed earlier. It also follows
that the top cohomology Hn−3(M0,n, D) ≃Γ(M0,n, Ωn−3
D
) has dimension (n−2)!. A natural
spanning set for Γ(Ωn−3

(3.7)
The (n −1)! Parke-Taylors deﬁned in this way are not linearly independent, because they
satisfy the shuﬄe relations of 2.4,
PTbc = 0,
(3.8)
for b, c nontrivial, identically4 [21]. Thus, following Proposition 2.4, we deduce that
Hn−3(M0,n, D) ≃Γ(M0,n, Ωn−3
D
) ≃Lie(n −1)∗.
(3.9)
Moreover, by Lemma 2.2, one can take a KK basis for Hn−3(M0,n, D), given by the PT1a, for
all (n−2)! permutations a. It follows from equation (2.4) that we have the following identity.
3Arnol’d [19] computes the Poincar´e polynomial of the cohomology of the conﬁguration space Mn−1 of n−1
points in C. This can be obtained inductively via the ﬁbration Mk →Mk−1 with ﬁbre C −{σ1, . . . , σk−1}
giving factors of (1 + (k −1)t). To get M#
0,n, one needs to take the quotient of Mn−1 by C∗⋉C, the stabilizer
in PSL2 of the point at inﬁnity. Arnol’d’s formula for the Poincar´e polynomial of Mn−1 must therefore be
divided by 1 + t to obtain the formula here.

(3.11)
where the Ip are (some ordering of) the subsets deﬁning the propagators of Γ. In particular,
PTΓ1a = PT1a. PTΓ is not always equal to a standard Parke-Taylor for the given dihedral
structure.
For the ordering 1a, an example of a tree, Γ, such that PTΓ ̸= PT1a is the
‘snowﬂake’, Γ = [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], 5], for which one ﬁnds
PTΓ = PT12345 × (13|24).
However, for a tree Γ in which every vertex is attached to at least one external particle, PTΓ
does give rise to the ordinary Parke-Taylor for that dihedral structure, and these expressions
for PTΓ, in dihedral coordinates, were ﬁrst considered and used by Koba and Nielsen in [22].
Note also that Γ 7→PTΓ is not a homomorphism from Lie(n −1) to Hn−3(M0,n, D),
since the PTΓ do not satisfy the Jacobi identity, which in particular implies that equation
(2.5) cannot be used to expand PTΓ in a basis of PTa’s.
3.2
Homology of M0,n
We saw, in equation (3.9), that there is an isomorphism of Hn−3(M0,n, D) with Lie(n −1)∗.
Integration gives a perfect pairing between relative cohomology, Hn−3(M0,n, D), and the
homology of the complement of the divisor, Hn−3(M0,n−D) [23]. It follows that the homology
Hn−3(M0,n −D) can be identiﬁed (as a vector space) with Lie(n −1).5 In this section, we
will review the description of the homology cycles of M0,n −D.
A point DΓ naturally gives rise to a class in Hn−3(M#
0,n) represented by a real half-
dimensional torus that surrounds DΓ. Explicitly, the cycle can be deﬁned as the locus
CΓ : |uIp| = ϵp ,
p = 1, . . . , n −3
(3.12)
5There is a free action of the symmetric group Sn on Hn−3(M0,n−D). As a module for Sn, Hn−3(M0,n−D)
is not isomorphic to Lie(n −1), but Lie(n −1) twisted by the sign representation of Sn.

for some small ϵp and choice of orientation. These cycles were ﬁrst described in [24], and
they generate the homology, but are not independent.6 Integrating a holomorphic top-form
with CΓ evaluates the residue at DΓ [26]. Lemma 7.1 of [18] states that PTa can only have a
pole at those DΓ which are compatible with the ordering a. Moreover, it is clear that we can
orient the CΓa so that
Z
CΓa
PTa = +1,
which leads to the following,
Lemma 3.2 The cycles CΓ1a represent a basis for Hn−3(M#
0,n), dual to the KK basis of
Hn−3(M0,n, D):
Z
CΓ1a
PT1b = (1a, 1b),
where we have chosen to orient the CΓ1a using the PT1a forms so that the residues are +1.
The relations amoung the top cycles are given by Jacobi-type relations.
Lemma 3.3 (Cohen7) For three trees related by Jacobi, there exists a contraction of the sum
of the corresponding cycles, CΓs + CΓt + CΓu.
An explicit homotopy contracting CΓs + CΓt + CΓu is easy to visualize for n = 4, since
M#
0,4 = CP1 −{0, 1, ∞}, with boundary points Ds = 0, Dt = 1, and Du = ∞. Appropriately
oriented, the three small circles around these points add up to zero in homology.
TΓs
TΓt
TΓu
.
More generally, for n > 4, we can exhibit a contraction of CΓs +CΓt +CΓu by making small all
ϵ’s in deﬁnition of the cycle, equation (3.12), except for the ϵ corresponding to the propagator
being exchanged. This restricts us to a CP1 component of D, where the same argument made
for n = 4 can be applied.8
It follows from Lemma 3.3 and equation (2.5) that,
CΓ =
X
a
(Γ, 1a)Γ1a.
Combining this with Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 implies,
6The homology of conﬁguration spaces was ﬁrst computed by [25], but the cycles are described by Cohen
[24].
Cohen was studying the homology of conﬁguration spaces.
To apply his results here one uses the
isomorphism M0,n −D ≃Confn−3(R2 −{0, 1}).
7This is a consequence of Theorem 1.2 in [24], as reviewed in [27].
8The maximum dimension tori appearing in Lemma 3.3 can be constructed by taking the wedge products
of lower dimensional tori. This leads to a natural product in the full homology H∗(M0,n −D), under which
H∗can be identiﬁed with a graded Lie algebra, with graded Jacobi relations holding in all dimensions. [24]
The (ungraded) Jacobi relation in Lemma 3.3 is a special case. [24, 27]

A Penrose transform for amplitudes
Our starting point is the observation that Kn can be identiﬁed with H1(M0,n, D).
Our
‘twistor space’ for the Penrose transform will be T = T ∗
DM0,n, the total space of the bundle
of holomorphic 1-forms on M0,n with logarithmic singularities on D. The relationship with
Kn is given by the isomorphism
Kn := H1(M0,n, D) ≃Γ(M0,n, T ∗
D) .
(4.1)
This correspondence can be expressed by considering d log of the Koba-Nielsen factor [22],
which is, in the standard gauge ﬁxing,
KN :=
Y
i<j
σsij
ij ,
σij = σi −σj .
(4.2)
This gives the general section of τ ∈Γ(T ∗
DM0,n) as
τ =
X
i
Eidσi :=
X
i<j
sijd log σij ,
Ei =
X
j
sij
σij
.
(4.3)
The second equality shows that this is clearly invariant under translations and rescalings of
the σi, but full Mobius invariance (i.e., vanishing when contracted with P
i σ2
i ∂σi) requires
P
i sij = 0.
Our normalizations (σ1, σn−1, σn) = (0, 1, ∞) gives the triviality of d log σin
and d log σ1 n−1 giving the correct dimensionality of the d log σij basis of H1. Note that the
equations Ei = 0 are the scattering equations.
To more clearly demonstrate the d log behaviour on D, given a choice of the standard
ordering, we can also represent the Koba Nielsen factor as [28]
KN =
Y
j>i+1
uXij
ij
,
Xij =
X
i≤l<m<j
slm .
(4.4)
This gives the useful representation of the general section in terms of the n(n −3)/2 basis
d log uij
X
i
Eidσi =
X
j>i+1
Xijd log uij.
(4.5)
This representation manifests the d log behaviour on the components of D compatible with
this choice of ordering.

4.1
The double ﬁbration and the CHY formulae
The twistor correspondence arises from the following double ﬁbration:
Yn = Kn × M0,n, (sij, σj)
p ↙
↘q
(sij), Kn
T = T ∗
DM0,n, (τi, σi).
(4.6)
where p forgets the second factor and and q is deﬁned by the incidence relations
τi = Ei(skl, σm) :=
X
j
sij
σij
.
(4.7)
A point in Kn therefore determines a section τi = Ei of T →Mo,n.
A special role is played by the zero-section T0 of T as it encodes the scattering equations;
given generic sij, the section τi = Ei(σ) intersects T0 at the (n−3)! solutions to the scattering
equations. We therefore introduce ¯δ(τ)n−3 to be the (0, n −3)-form delta function supported
on T0. In the standard gauge ﬁxing above it can be deﬁned by
¯δ(τ)n−3 :=
n−2
Y
i=2
¯∂
1
2πiτi
,
where
¯∂
1
2πiz = δ(ℜz)δ(ℑz)d¯z .
(4.8)
More invariantly, this takes values in (Ωn−3
D
M0,n)∗so that to use it in an integrand, we will
need an extra factor with values in (Ωn−3
D
M0,n)2.
A ﬁrst observation is that the CHY formulae can be regarded as examples of a Penrose
transform in the sense that the amplitudes are obtained as the pushdown to Kn of a pullback
of an object from T. The generic CHY formula takes the form:
M(sij, . . .) =
Z
M0,n=p−1(sij)
q∗ IlIr ¯δ(τ)n−3
(4.9)
Here Il, Ir ∈Ωn−3
D
M0,n are CHY half-integrands but also often depending also on polarization
data, with the most basic example being m(a, b) when (Il, Ir) = (PTa, PTb). There is an
empirical direct correspondence between choices of Il/r and numerators NΓ with for example
the CHY Pfaﬃan9 Pf′(M) corresponding to the Nk,ϵ
Γ
described earlier. See [29, 30] for details
of half-integrands for other theories and their origins.
9For completeness, the CHY Pfaﬃan is the reduced Pfaﬃan of the matrix M
M =




Cij = ki · ϵj
σi −σj ,
for i ̸= j
constructed from polarization vectors ϵi with ki ·ϵi = 0 . . ., and Aii = Bii = 0, Cii = ϵi ·P ki/σij. This matrix
is degenerate, but removing two rows and columns, say ij, taking the Pfaﬃan and dividing by σij yields a
well-deﬁned half-integrand.

4.2
The geometry of the correspondence
A generic point (τi, σi) of T corresponds to a codimension-n −3 plane in Kn. This plane is
the (n −2)(n −3)/2 dimensional space of sections that pass through the point. For a point
lying in a top-stratum, DI, of the divisor, these planes lie inside the factorisation hyperplane
plane sI = 0. This follows from the following combination [31] of the scattering equations
EI = sI
2 +
X
i∈I,j∈¯I
sij
σi1σjn
σijσ1n
.
(4.10)
and the fact that, assuming 1 ∈I and n ∈¯I, the second term vanishes when restricted to DI.
It follows that the point (τi, σi) = (0, DΓ) ∈T corresponds to the codimension-n−3 plane
in Kn given by the intersection of the planes sIp = 0, where Ip are the subsets of {1, . . . , n−1}
corresponding to the momentum ﬂowing through each propagator in Γ. We can characterize
these planes as being those planes passing through the origin with normal n −3-form
wΓ = ±
n−3
^
p=1
dsIp.
(4.11)
In the next section, we will see how the wΓ arise from the double ﬁbration and show how
their signs are ﬁxed to make them satisfy the same relations as the n −3-forms deﬁned by
[6].
4.3
The symplectic form and the holomorphic volume form
By studying the symplectic volume form ωn−3 on T ∗
DM0,n, we ﬁnd two elementary conse-
quences of the double ﬁbration. In this section, we describe how the symplectic volume gives
rise to a transform between n −3 cycles in M0,n −D and the n −3-forms, equation (??), en-
countered above. In the next section we will describe the associated correspondence between
(n −3)-planes in Kn and (n −3)-cycles in Hn−3(M0,n, D). Distinguished classes in Hn−3 are
seen to correspond to the planes deﬁned by [6].
The symplectic form on T ∗
DM0,n can be written explicitly as
ω =
X
i̸=1,n−1,n
dτi ∧dσi,
where τi are the components of τ = P τidσi in these coordinates.
Pulling back ωn−3 to
Yn, we can decompose it into a sum over a basis of Γ(M0,n, Ωn−3
D
) with coeﬃcients given
by n −3-forms on Kn. This gives rise to a correspondence between n −3-forms on Kn and
(n −3)-cycles in M0,n which we explain in this section. In the next section, we describe the
associated correspondence between (n−3)-planes in Kn (‘ABHY planes’) and (n−3)-cocycles
in Hn−3(M0,n, D).
Every cycle CΓ in Hn−3(M0,n −D) deﬁnes an n −3-form on Kn,
wΓ :=
Z
CΓ
q∗ωn−3 ∈Ωn−3(Kn) .
(4.12)
– 15 –

It is clear that, for a Jacobi triple of trees,
wΓs + wΓt + wΓu = 0.
(4.13)
In other words, the map Lie(n −1) ,→∧n−3K∗
n given by Γ 7→wΓ is a homomorphism.
To ﬁnd an explicit expression for wΓ, we use the representation (4.5) of q∗τ in a choice
of dihedral coordinates uij for which Γ is planar. This gives
q∗ω = d(q∗τ) =
X
i+1<j
dXij ∧duij
uij
(4.14)
It is then easily seen that integration of q∗ωn−3 over CΓ picks out only those poles that
correspond to propagators of Γ. The residue thus gives a wedge product ∧dsIp, with the
overall sign determined by the orientation of CΓ. Given this explicit form of wΓ, the Jacobi
relation, equation (4.13), can also be understood to follow from the momentum conservation
relation, ds + dt + du = 0 [6].
It follows from equation (2.5) that wΓ admits the expansion
wΓ =
X
a∈SN−2
wΓ1a(Γ, 1a).
(4.15)
Combining this with Lemmas 3.4 and 2.3, we ﬁnd that we can write the pull-back of the
symplectic volume form as
q∗ωn−3 =
X
a∈Sn−2
wΓ1aPT1a .
(4.16)
Although we have used the dual comb and KK bases, this relation follows in any dual basis,
because wΓ and PTa furnish representations of Lie(n −1) and Lie(n −1)∗respectively so
that(4.16) is an explicit of writing the Kronecker delta. For example, when n = 4, q∗ω can
be written in any one of the three KK bases,
q∗ω = −ds12 ∧PT213 −ds23 ∧PT231
= ds12 ∧PT123 + ds13 ∧PT132
= −ds23 ∧PT321 + ds13 ∧PT312.
(4.17)
More generally, we can rewrite q∗ωn−3 using whatever bases we choose.
Lemma 4.1 The pullback of the symplectic volume form to Yn can be written
q∗ωn−3 =
X
Γ∈H,a∈K
(Γ, a) wΓ ∧PTa .
for a basis H of Lie(n −1), and a basis K of Lie(n −1)∗.

Associahedral (n −3)-planes in Kn and forms on M0,n.
An alternative way to study the correspondence is to restrict ωn−3 to diﬀerent (n −3)-planes
in Kn.
This correspondence is related to the construction in [32], although they discuss
diﬀerent planes and polytopes. Distinguished classes in Hn−3(M0,n, D) correspond to the
associahedral planes found in [6].
An n −3-plane in Kn is deﬁned up to translation by its tangent form P ∈∧n−3Kn. For
any such plane, P, the symplectic volume form gives rise to an n −3-form in Γ(M0,n, Ωn−3
D
),
P
q∗ωn−3.
Recall the deﬁnition of PTΓ ∈Γ(M0,n, Ωn−3
D
), given in equation (3.11), which is a top form
associated to a dihedral structure, a, together with a tree Γ that is compatible with that
ordering. PTΓ corresponds to a plane PΓ in Kn deﬁned as follows. Fix a dihedral structure
a and let
DI :=
∂
∂XI

X
J∈Ic
∂
∂XJ
,
such that we have
DI log KN = log uI −
X
J∈Ic
log uJ = log
uI
1 −uI
,
(4.18)
by the non-crossing identity, equation (3.2). It follows that, for a compatible set of propagators
Ip, deﬁning a tree Γ that is compatible with a, we can deﬁne a plane
PΓ =
n−3
^
p=1
DIp,
– 17 –

for some ordering of the propagators chosen so that
PΓ
q∗ωn−3 = q∗PTa,Γ.
(4.19)
In particular, when we take Pa,Γ to be the comb, P1a := P1a,Γ1a, we recover the Parke-Taylor
factors in the standard KK basis,
P1a
q∗ωn−3 = q∗PT1a.
For a general Γ, in dihedral structure a, the equations of the plane associated to PΓ can be
written as
XJ +
X
r s.t. J∈Icr
XIr = const.,
(4.20)
for all J compatible with the ordering a and not corresponding to a propagator of Γ. These
equations bear no obvious resemblance to those deﬁned in [6], but we will see that our planes
are the same as theirs.
First, notice that the Pa satisfy
Pa =
X
(Γ1b, a)P1b,
by Lemma 3.1, and that, moreover,
(wΓ, Pa) =
Z
CΓ
PTa = (Γ, a),
using Lemma 3.4.
In [6], the ABHY planes are deﬁned, for the ordering a = 1...n −1 and the comb Γa, to
be deﬁned by the (n −2)(n −3)/2 equations
sij = const.,
for 1 ≤i < j −1 < n −2. Using the identity, sij = Xij + Xi+1j+1 −Xij+1 −Xi+1j we can
verify that, for Ip in Γa,
DIpsij = 0,
(4.21)
for all 1 ≤i < j −1 < n −2, and each p. Fixing an sij, one can check this equation for each
p. The chord Ip is the arc kn for k = 2, ..., n −2. The ﬁve cases to check are (i) k ≤i, (ii)
k = i + 1, (iii) i + 1 < k < j, (iv) k = j, and (v) k > j. That equation (4.21) vanishes in
these ﬁve cases is easily seen from Figure 1. Conversely, we can deﬁne the ABHY plane for
the ordering a and the comb Γa to be given by the tangent form
Pa =

(4.23)
For ﬁxed i, there are ﬁve cases to check, and these are shown in Figure 2. By these arguments,
we conclude that
Lemma 4.2 The planes Pa,Γ deﬁned by the correspondence, equation (4.19), are the ABHY
planes when Γa is the comb for the ordering a.
Moreover, the arguments that led to this Lemma can be applied to the case of general Γ,
which leads to the following
Lemma 4.3 The planes Pa,Γ deﬁned by the correspondence, equation (4.19), are given by the
(n −2)(n −3)/2 equations
sij = const.,
for all chords (ij) compatible with the ordering that are not one of the n −3 propagators of
Γ.
It is a consequence of the results in [6] that the planes in Lemma 4.3 are ABHY planes,
in the sense that they cut out associahedra in the same way as the original planes in [33].

Scattering forms and CHY
The scattering forms of [6] are deﬁned by the following sum over trees,
Ωa =
X
Γ
wΓ(a, Γ)
dΓ
,
(4.24)
where dΓ = Qn−3
p=1 sIp and Ip are the propagators of Γ. The (a, Γ)-factor reduces the sum to
one over trees that are planar for the ordering a.
The symplectic form discussed above gives rise to the ABHY scattering forms on Kn from
the Dolbeault formula
Ωa =
Z
p−1(sij)
q∗¯δn−3(τ) ∧ωn−3PTa

,
(4.25)
where
¯δn−3(τ) =
n−3
^
i=1
¯δ(τi) ,
¯δ(z) =
1
2πi
¯∂1
z .
(4.26)
To see that equation (4.25) is equal to equation (4.24), we use Lemma 4.1 to rewrite equation
(4.25) as
Ωa =
X
b
wΓ1b
Z
p−1(sij)
q∗¯δn−3(τ) ∧PT1bPTa

.
We recognize that the integral is the CHY formula [7, 8] for m(a, b), deﬁned in equation
(2.17). It follows that equation (4.25) can be expanded as
Ωa =
X
b
wΓ1b(Γ, 1b)(Γ, a)
dΓ
,
which is equal to (4.24) by equation (4.15). We conclude that
Proposition 4.4 The ABHY scattering form Ωa is given by equation (4.25).
More generally, given any CHY half-integrand I, we can deﬁne an ABHY scattering form
ΩI :=
Z
p−1(sij)
q∗¯δn−3(τ) ∧ωn−3 I

.
(4.27)
This form admits an expansion
ΩI =
X
a
wΓ1a
Z
p−1(sij)
q∗¯δn−3(τ)PT1aI

.
The CHY integral as given is not changed by adding to I a term that vanishes on the support
of the scattering equations. One can regard I as a representative of a twisted cohomology
class, as explained in [34].

All scattering forms, ΩI, obtained in this way are projective. Let Υ be the Euler vector
ﬁeld on Kn,
Υ =

We can lift Υ trivially to Yn using the product structure. On objects pulled back from T it

Lemma 4.5 The scattering form ΩI is a projective form on PKn.
Finally, amplitudes are obtained by restricting the scattering forms ΩI to ABHY planes,
as in [6]. In fact, the restriction of ΩI to Pa evaluates to give the CHY formula for the
integrands PTa and I, as follows from the deﬁnition of Pa (equation (4.19) and subsequent
lines). Moreover, for a general cohomology class
N :=
X
a
N1aPT1a ∈Hn−3,
we have an associated plane, PN := P
a N1aP1a. Pairing this with the general scattering form
ΩI gives the CHY amplitude for integrands N and I.

Discussion
We have seen that Lie polynomials underpin the color-kinematics and double copy framework
of BCJ. We have reviewed the classical fact that the top homology of M0,n −D is isomorphic
to the Lie polynomials, Lie(n−1), and shown that there is a natural correspondence between
T ∗
DM0,n and Kn under which the CHY integral formulae can be understood as a Penrose
transform. This can be extended to a transform between the holomorphic Liouville form and
the diﬀerential forms wΓ introduced by [6], and also between CHY half-integrands and the
scattering forms introduced by [6].
One underlying question in the subject is whether there is a kinematic algebra under-
pinning the kinematic numerators Nk,ϵ
Γ .
Although we have seen that the color factors of
Lie algebras can provide such numerators, we have also seen many examples of numerators
satisfying the Jacobi identity that do not arise as color factors for a Lie algebra: for example,
(Γ, a) and wΓ and so on. In other words, the existence of a homomorphism from Lie(n −1)
to some vector space does not of itself determine a Lie algebra.
– 21 –

The basic results in this paper can be taken further to yield natural recursions in ﬁeld the-
ory, which lead to both Lie polynomial and ABHY-form based proofs of the known properties
of the ﬁeld theory momentum kernel and of kinematic numerators. The momentum kernel
can be studied also in T ∗M0,n, where it arises in the CHY treatment of KLT orthogonality
[35]. It also seems likely that the framework will naturally extend to loop integrands in the
context of nodal spheres following the logic of [36–40].
The correspondence we have described is suggestive of the naive explicit formula
NIl
Γ =
Z
CΓ
Il ,
(5.1)
for numerators in terms of CHY half-integrands. However, such formulae fail for the CHY
Pfaﬃan that one would expect to give the basic Yang-Mills kinematic numerators; the formula
is compromised by the interdependence between in particular reduced Pfaﬃans and scattering
equations. This equation is shown to be invalid as written but a slightly diﬀerent formulation
in a similar spirit is shown to work when Il represents a cohomology class in the context of
twisted cohomology by Mizera [41].
We remark that the twisted cycle formulation of string integrals in [42] naturally arises
in the context of the holomorphic geometric quantization of T ∗
DM0,n. To carry out geometric
quantization one introduces the line bundle L →T ∗
DM0,n with connection ∇= d + α′τ
where τ = P
i τidσi is the canonical 1-form (symplectic potential) and α′ plays the role
of Planck’s constant. Polarized wave functions should be independent of τi. On pull back
to the correspondence space, Yn, the connection ∇becomes the standard twisted exterior
derivative associated to the Koba-Nielsen factor. Such a quantization of T ∗M0,n perhaps most
naturally arises from ambitwistor-string path-integral [43], where the Pfaﬃan half-integrand
for kinematic numerators arises from the RNS spin ﬁeld path-integral.
There are many further connections to be followed up; we brieﬂy mention the delta
algebras of [44] and the formulations of colour-kinematics duality in [45, 46].
