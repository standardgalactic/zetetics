Text reading prosody and reading comprehension are related, but both rely on decoding.
The aim of the current study was, therefore, to disentangle the contribution of decoding
from that of prosody skills. We examined the performance on text reading prosody and
speech prosody in ﬁfth-grade children with age-appropriate decoding but weak compre-
hension. We compared their performance with that of chronological-age controls and
younger, comprehension-level controls. We found that poor comprehenders scored
signiﬁcantly below the chronological-age controls on all prosody tasks. Importantly,
poor comprehenders scored below the younger, comprehension-level controls on a
speech rhythm task. Furthermore, speech prosody explained unique variance in
predicting reading comprehension status (poor comprehender vs comprehension-level
control). This suggests that poor comprehenders have a delay in prosodic development,
with an additional indication of a deﬁciency in perception and production of speech
prosody. The results show that the relation between text reading prosody and reading
comprehension does not exclusively rely on decoding.

•
Children with good decoding but poor comprehension (poor comprehenders)
performed a text reading prosody task and speech prosody tasks.
•
Poor comprehenders scored signiﬁcantly lower than chronological-age controls
on both types of prosody tasks and lower than younger, comprehension-level
controls on a speech rhythm task. Producing appropriate speech prosody while
telling a story explained unique variance in distinguishing between poor
comprehenders and comprehension-level controls.
Implications for practice and/or policy
•
Perception and production of speech prosody may be less developed in poor
comprehenders and may partly contribute to reading comprehension problems.
•
Appropriate use of prosody may be needed for reading comprehension in order
to form a correct internal representation of a written text.
Reading comprehension is a complex process that requires children to quickly and accu-
rately recognise the words in a text, while simultaneously constructing meaning. As such,
reading ﬂuency is assumed to be a prerequisite for reading comprehension and traditionally
has been deﬁned as reading (text) at speed and without errors (‘the automaticity aspect’).
More recently, however, it has been shown that the degree to which children use appropri-
ate prosody (e.g., intonation, stress placement, word boundaries, pausing and rhythm)
when reading aloud is also associated with their reading comprehension ability, and ‘text
reading prosody’ has been added to the concept of reading ﬂuency (adding to reading
speed and reading accuracy; e.g., Miller & Schwanenﬂugel, 2006, 2008; Rasinski, Rikli,
& Johnston, 2009; Veenendaal, Groen, & Verhoeven, 2015). However, both text reading
prosody and reading comprehension strongly rely on the ability to read well. Indeed, it
has been found that efﬁcient and automatised decoding is an essential skill for ‘adult-like’
text reading prosody to develop in primary school children (Miller & Schwanenﬂugel,
2006; Schwanenﬂugel, Hamilton, Kuhn, Wisenbaker, & Stahl, 2004). Therefore, an out-
standing question is to what extent the ‘automaticity aspect’ and the ‘prosody aspect’ of
reading ﬂuency can be separated in their relation to reading comprehension. Is the ‘prosody
aspect’ merely an epiphenomenon of efﬁcient decoding, or does it merit a more indepen-
dent status? In order to further determine the relations between decoding, prosody and
reading comprehension, we study prosodic skills in a group of ‘poor comprehenders’ –
children with age-appropriate decoding but with persisting difﬁculties in reading compre-
hension (e.g., Nation, Cocksey, Taylor, & Bishop, 2010).
Decoding efﬁciency, text reading prosody and reading comprehension
To be able to read ﬂuently, traditionally has meant reading at speed and without errors, but
more recently, reading with appropriate intonation has also been suggested to be important
(e.g., Kuhn, Schwanenﬂugel, & Meisinger, 2010; Kuhn & Stahl, 2003). A relation between
the ‘automaticity aspect’ of text reading ﬂuency – deﬁned as speed and accuracy – and
reading comprehension has been reported repeatedly (e.g., Berninger et al., 2010; Kim
& Wagner, 2015; Kim, Wagner, & Lopez, 2012), but there is a growing literature that em-
phasises the signiﬁcance of text reading prosody in this relation (e.g., Klauda & Guthrie,
2008; Miller & Schwanenﬂugel, 2006, 2008; T. Rasinski et al., 2009; Schwanenﬂugel
et al., 2004). Text reading prosody can be assessed by means of rating scales, to obtain a

holistic measure of prosody, or by spectrographic analyses, to measure individual features
of prosody. Rating scales assess prosodic aspects such as enthusiasm, phrasing, general
smoothness and pace, when children read a text aloud. Studies that used such rating scales
showed that text reading prosody was signiﬁcantly correlated to reading comprehension in
children from third, ﬁfth, and seventh grade (T. Rasinski et al., 2009) and that text reading
prosody accounted for substantial variance in reading comprehension scores in children
from fourth grade (Calet, Deﬁor, & Gutiérrez-Palma, 2015; Veenendaal et al., 2015) and
ﬁfth grade (Klauda & Guthrie, 2008). Other studies used spectrographic analyses in order
to assess prosodic features such as pauses, intonation contours and end-of-sentence pitch.
Miller and Schwanenﬂugel (2008) showed that children with a decreasing number of inap-
propriate pauses in their oral reading from ﬁrst to second grade and an early adult-like
intonation contour performed better on a reading comprehension test in third grade.
Further, it was shown that skilled readers read with fewer inappropriate pauses and with
more intonation than beginning readers (Schwanenﬂugel et al., 2004).
Because inappropriate pausing is associated with decoding problems, it has been pro-
posed that automaticity in reading, that is, decoding efﬁciency, is necessary for text reading
prosody to develop (Schwanenﬂugel et al., 2004). However, even though decoding may be
a necessary prerequisite for an appropriate text reading prosody performance; no studies
have yet investigated whether it is also sufﬁcient. Poor comprehenders are of interest in this
context, as their decoding skills dissociate from their reading comprehension skills. If
decoding efﬁciency is sufﬁcient for the relation between text reading prosody and compre-
hension to develop, then it is expected that poor comprehenders will show an
age-appropriate level of text reading prosody. If, however, decoding is necessary, but not
sufﬁcient for this relation to develop, and text reading prosody is more tied to reading com-
prehension, we expect their text reading prosody skills to be weak.
Speech prosody and reading comprehension
Both decoding efﬁciency and text reading prosody strongly rely on the ability to read well.
To further disentangle the contribution of decoding efﬁciency to the association between
prosody and reading comprehension, we investigate speech prosody skills (i.e., the percep-
tion and production of speech rhythm, stress placement and word boundaries in oral
language) in the same poor comprehenders. Although it was shown that early prosodic
speech perception contributed to reading-related skills, such as phonological and morpho-
logical awareness (Zhang & McBride-Chang, 2010), little is known about the contribution
of early prosody skills to later reading comprehension.
Only a few studies examined the relation between speech prosody and reading comprehen-
sion, as a part of general reading skills (Holliman et al., 2014; Kent, 2013; Lochrin, Arciuli, &
Sharma, 2015; Whalley & Hansen, 2006). Holliman et al. (2014) showed that the
performance on a prosody test that assessed perception of stress placement, intonation and
timing was correlated with reading comprehension in children from ﬁrst and second grade.
A comprehensive assessment of speech prosody is the Proﬁling Elements of Prosodic
Systems - Children (PEPS-C) computer test (Peppé & McCann, 2003) that measures both
perception and production of speech prosody. Kent (2013) found that the performance on a
number of tasks of the PEPS-C test – perception of speech rhythm, stress placement and word
boundaries – was associated with children’s reading comprehension. Furthermore, the
perception of word boundaries and stress placement explained unique variance in reading

comprehension scores in fourth grade children (Kent, 2013). Lochrin et al. (2015) also used
the PEPS-C test but examined perception and production of speech prosody and related this
to word reading and reading comprehension outcomes in children from 7 to 12 years of age.
They found that the perception and production of word boundaries and the perception of
speech rhythm and stress placement were associated with reading comprehension, but only
the production of word boundaries explained unique variance in reading comprehension
(Lochrin et al., 2015). Conversely, Whalley and Hansen (2006) used the PEPS-C word
boundary task and another, similar word boundary test, and found that these two receptive
tasks were not correlated with reading comprehension in fourth grade children. The earlier
results show that different aspects of speech prosody might differently relate to reading com-
prehension, although they also show that results are not consistent between studies. The in-
consistent results mainly seem to relate to task-dependent factors with most studies
assessing perception of speech prosody (Kent, 2013; Whalley & Hansen, 2006) and some
studies assessing production and perception (Lochrin et al., 2015). Furthermore, the age of
the children that participated and the control variables included differed (phonological aware-
ness and rhythmic sensitivity, Whalley & Hansen, 2006; age and phonological awareness,
Lochrin et al., 2015; decoding and listening comprehension, Kent, 2013). In the current study,
therefore, we choose to assess speech prosody using a wide range of perception and produc-
tion tasks, as well as a more ecologically valid story-telling context.
The present study
The aim of the present study was to disentangle the contribution of decoding efﬁciency to
the association between prosody and reading comprehension, by using two different
approaches. First, the current literature proposes that efﬁcient decoding is a necessary skill
for the relation between text reading prosody and reading comprehension to emerge, but it
is as yet unclear whether decoding is also sufﬁcient. We investigated the performance of
children
with
strong
decoding
but
weak
reading
comprehension
skills
(‘poor
comprehenders’) to provide more insight into this issue. Second, we examined whether
speech prosody skills – more speciﬁcally, storytelling and the perception and production
of speech rhythm, stress placement and word boundaries – are related to reading compre-
hension as strongly as reading-related prosody tasks are.
This lead to the following research question: To what extent do poor comprehenders
differ in their prosodic abilities across written and spoken modalities from a
chronological-age control group and a younger, comprehension-level control group? The
inclusion of a younger control group with similar reading comprehension allowed us to
determine the extent to which the prosody skills of poor comprehenders are in line with
their level of reading comprehension. If the poor comprehenders would perform at a lower
level than the younger, comprehension-level control group, this could provide an indication
of a restricting factor in their reading comprehension performance.
Method
Participants
Fifth-grade poor comprehenders were identiﬁed in a two-step process. First, we asked
teachers from six medium-sized, primary schools in the Eastern part of the Netherlands

to refer children to us based on performance on annual national assessments1 on word rec-
ognition (Krom, Jongen, Verhelst, Kamphuis, & Kleintjes, 2010) and reading comprehen-
sion (Staphorsius & Krom, 2011). Each poor comprehender was individually matched on
chronological-age and word recognition score on the national assessment with a child from
the same school and class and matched on reading comprehension level with a younger
child, also from the same school. Children with a diagnosis of a language or reading im-
pairment or with speech problems were a priori excluded from participation in the study.
Then, in step two, we conﬁrmed the children’s reading skills based on our own
assessments.
Speciﬁcally, the criteria for initial group membership (poor comprehenders vs
chronological-age matched controls vs comprehension-level matched controls) as used
by the teachers were based on grade-based norm-scores on the national assessments,
which provided broad percentile score categories: children received an A (above 75th
percentile), B (50th–75th percentile), C (25th–50th percentile, D (10th–25th percentile)
or E (below 10th percentile) score. Following selection criteria from previous studies
(e.g., Catts, Adlof, & Weismer, 2006; Fletcher et al., 1994; Stanovich & Siegel, 1994),
all children (poor comprehenders, chronological-age controls and comprehension-level
controls) had average to above-average (i.e., above the 50th percentile) word recognition
skills – scoring an A or B – and within the triads, children were matched on that score.
Furthermore, the poor comprehenders had lower score than average reading comprehen-
sion skills (below the 25th percentile; scoring D or E), whereas both groups of controls
scored above the 50th percentile on reading comprehension (again, scoring A or B). To
identify the younger controls, who performed at the same reading comprehension level
as the poor comprehenders, but above the 50th percentile for their grade, reading-age
scores (as derived from the national assessments) were compared. Children in the youn-
ger control group were predominantly from third grade, with a few children from second
or fourth grade. Triads of 28 ‘poor comprehenders’ along with 28 children in each of the
control groups, making a total of 84 children participating, were initially referred by
teachers.
Second, to conﬁrm the status of ‘poor comprehenders’ as indicated by the schools, we
assessed reading comprehension, word recognition and pseudoword decoding ourselves
for all children. See for a full description the section. Data from poor comprehenders with
reading comprehension scores above the sample-based 50th percentile on the reading com-
prehension measure we administered ourselves were rejected. This led to the exclusion of
seven children in the poor comprehender group and their chronological-age and
comprehension-level controls, resulting in 63 participants remaining (21 per group); 12
girls and 9 boys in the poor comprehender group, 14 girls and 7 boys in the
chronological-age control group and 9 girls and 12 boys in the comprehension-level
control group. All participating children were native speakers of Dutch. Parental informed
consent was obtained for all participating children.

Reading comprehension
The reading comprehension test was constructed of two standardised reading comprehen-
sion tests (Aarnoutse & Kapinga, 2006). One of these tests was a reading comprehension
test for children from ﬁrst, second and third grade, and the other one was a test for children
from fourth, ﬁfth and sixth grade. Questions from both tests were included to prevent ﬂoor
and ceiling effects. The reading comprehension test presented the children with seven short
texts; each followed by three multiple choice questions and two to four ‘true or false’
questions about each text. Four texts were informative, and three texts were narratives.
The total number of items for this test was 44. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefﬁcient
has been calculated for this sample and was .83.
Word recognition
Word recognition efﬁciency (rate) was assessed with a standardised test by Brus and
Voeten (1973). Three columns with a total of 116 words were presented to the children,
who were given 1 minute to read as many words as possible, as quickly and clearly as
they could. The wordlist included one-syllable words and two-syllable and multi-syllable
words. Raw scores were converted to standard scores (M = 10, standard deviation
[SD] = 3). Cronbach’s alpha reliability was reported to be between .73 and .92 (Brus &
Voeten, 1973).
Pseudoword decoding
Efﬁciency of pseudoword decoding was measured with a standardised test by Van den Bos,
Lutje Spelberg, Scheepstra, and de Vries (1994). The pseudowords have been created based
on the existing words from the word recognition task described earlier and were therefore
similar in number of syllables and phonotactic complexity. Children had 2 minutes to read
as many items, as quickly and clearly as they could. Raw scores were converted to standard
scores (M = 10, SD = 3). Cronbach’s alpha was reported to be between .63 and .80 for the
pseudoword decoding test (Van den Bos et al., 1994).
Prosody assessment
The use of prosody during reading (text reading prosody) and during storytelling
(storytelling prosody) was assessed by means of a rating scale that distinguishes
enthusiasm, phrasing, smoothness and pace. Additionally, three subtasks with a receptive
and a productive part of each of the Dutch version of the PEPS-C computer task (Peppé &
McCann, 2003) were used to assess speech prosody: two speech rhythm tasks (PEPS-C:
long-item discrimination and imitation), two word boundary tasks (PEPS-C: chunking)
and two stress placement tasks (PEPS-C: contrastive stress). In the receptive parts of each
subtask (perception of prosody), children listened to sound samples, presented via the
speakers of a computer, whereas in the expressive parts (production of prosody), children
had to produce prosodic utterances themselves. There were 16 items per task, plus two
practice items to start each task with. The practice items were not included in the scores.
Because of the problems with the expressive word boundary task, this task was not
included in the analyses. Because of the translation into Dutch, half of the items became

too lengthy and therefore too complex for the children. Therefore, we report the results on
the ﬁve remaining PEPS-C subtasks. Each of these prosody tasks is described in more
detail in the succeeding text.
Text reading prosody
To assess text reading prosody, we used two short narratives (approximately 100 words
each). Word frequency was based on a selection of wordlists naming the most frequent
words for Dutch schoolchildren (Vermeer, 2000) to make sure that the texts were not
too difﬁcult for the younger children participating. Children were ﬁrst asked to read
the two short stories silently and then to read these aloud. They were asked to read
the way they would normally read aloud in class. The reading was recorded on a digital
voice recorder and scored at a later time by means of the Multidimensional Fluency
Scale (Rasinski, 2004). This scale assesses four aspects of prosody: expression (making
the text sound like natural language, adequate expression and enthusiasm), phrasing
(marking
clause
and
sentence
units),
smoothness
(resolves
word
and
structure
difﬁculties easily) and pace (pleasant conversational pace, not too fast and not too
slow). On each of these sections, children could receive between 1 and 4 points,
resulting in a total score ranging from 4 to 16. An average score over the two stories
has been used for analysis. The reliability of this task has been calculated, and the
sample-based Cronbach’s alpha was .85. Twenty percent of the data were scored by
an independent rater, and inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correla-
tion coefﬁcients (ICC), using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) two-way mixed model
and an absolute agreement deﬁnition (rather than consistency). The ICC on the average
score
for
the
two
texts
(as
used
for
analysis)
was
excellent:
ICC
=
.940,
F(11,11) = 29.625, p < .001.
Storytelling prosody
Speech prosody was ﬁrstly assessed by using two storytelling cards (Verhoeven &
Vermeer, 2001). Each card showed a sequence of six pictures. Children were asked to
look at these pictures and to tell a story about what happened. The child was asked to
make the story sound interesting for a younger child that would not see the pictures.
The stories were recorded on a digital recorder, and prosody was scored at a later time.
The Multidimensional Fluency Scale (Rasinski, 2004) was adapted to make it more suit-
able for assessing storytelling prosody. In the adapted version, the four sections refer to
expression (making it sound like a natural story, adequate expression and enthusiasm),
phrasing (adequate indication of sentence, phrase and passage boundaries), smoothness
(generally smooth speech, structure difﬁculties resolved quickly) and pace (consistently
conversational pace, not too fast and not too slow). Performance on each section was
marked with 1–4 points, so total scores per story ranged from 4 to 16. An average score
over the two stories has been used for analysis. Reliability of this task has been calcu-
lated, and Cronbach’s alpha was .86. Twenty percent of the data were scored by an in-
dependent rater, and inter-rater reliability was calculated. The ICC on the average score
for the two stories (as used for analysis) was excellent: ICC = .873, F(11,11) = 16.777,
p < .001.

Speech rhythm
The receptive task was the long-item discrimination task of the PEPS-C computer test,
which assessed the ability to hear differences in rhythmic patterns of ﬁltered speech. On
each trial, children heard pairs of short phrases (six to seven syllables), taken from other
PEPS-C tasks (word boundaries and stress placement). These phrases were low-passed
ﬁltered and, therefore, lacked any phonemic content, sounding as if someone was talking
in a room next door. Pitch, loudness and length variation was preserved, though. The child
was asked to indicate whether the two phrases sounded the same (which was the case on
half of the trials) or different from each other. The child received one point per correct
answer. The internal reliability of this task has been calculated. After removing four items,
Cronbach’s alpha was reasonable, α = .59. Twelve items were therefore included in further
analyses.
The expressive speech rhythm task was the long-item imitation task. Children heard
short phrases and had to repeat not only the words but also the speech pattern of the phrase
as precisely as possible. The sentences had six to seven syllables and were based, in
structure, on the sentences in the word boundary and stress placement tasks, without being
identical to those. An example is ‘I wanted YELLOW shoes’. The tester decided whether
the imitation was correct, and children received either one or a half point for their perfor-
mance. Twenty percent of the data were scored by an independent rater, and inter-rater
reliability was calculated. The ICC on the imitation task was excellent: ICC = .851,
F(11,11) = 11.726, p < .001. Reliability was calculated, and after removing two items,
Cronbach’s alpha was .69. The remaining 14 items have been included in further analyses.
Stress placement
The two contrastive stress tasks of the PEPS-C computer test assessed receptive and
expressive use of stress placement. The ﬁrst task was a receptive task. The child heard
a short story about someone who went to a store to buy socks but later realised that she
had forgotten to buy one speciﬁc colour of socks. The child heard sentences such as ‘I
wanted BLUE and black socks’. Children had to decide which colour of socks the speaker
had forgotten to buy. Half of the time, stress was placed on the ﬁrst word and the other
half, on the second word. Reliability of this task has been calculated, and Cronbach’s
alpha was .80.
Secondly, children performed an expressive contrastive stress task where they had to place
stress on certain words themselves. Children saw a picture and heard an incorrect commen-
tary. An example is a picture of a white cow with a ball, and the speaker saying ‘The red
cow has got the ball’. This was said in a neutral tone of voice, without any pitch or stress
changes. The child had to correct the speaker by saying ‘No, the WHITE cow has got the
ball!’ The tester decided whether the stress placement was appropriate. Twenty percent of
the data were scored by an independent rater. Inter-rater reliability analysis was performed,
and the ICC on the productive focus task was excellent: ICC = .914, F(11,11) = 32.133,
p < .001. Reliability analysis of this task showed a Cronbach’s alpha of .76.
Word boundaries
The receptive chunking task of the PEPS-C computer test assessed the perception of word
boundaries. Children saw two pictures on a computer screen and heard either a compound

noun and a noun or a string of nouns (e.g., ‘Chocolate-cake and jam’ vs ‘Chocolate, cake
and jam’). Children had to select the corresponding picture on the screen. Every correct an-
swer resulted in a point for the child. The reliability of this task was calculated, and after
removing four items, Cronbach’s reliability coefﬁcient was fair, α = .59. Twelve items have
therefore been included in further analyses.
Control variables
A productive vocabulary task and a nonverbal reasoning test (Raven) were added to the test
battery as general control measures.
Vocabulary
Productive vocabulary was assessed with a subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children III; Dutch edition (Kort et al., 2005). Children were aurally presented with a word
and were asked for a spoken deﬁnition of this word. Raw scores were converted to standard
scores (M = 10, SD = 3). Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefﬁcient has been reported to be .79
for this test (Kort et al., 2005). Twenty percent of the data were scored by an independent
rater, and inter-rater reliability was calculated. The ICC on the vocabulary task was
excellent: ICC = .972, F(11,11) = 75.602, p < .001.
Nonverbal reasoning
Nonverbal reasoning was assessed using the Raven (1976) Progressive Matrices Test.
Children received a booklet with 60 incomplete patterns and were asked to identify the
missing element that completed the pattern. Raw scores were converted to percentile
scores. Cronbach’s alpha has been reported to be .90 for this test (Raven, 1976).
Procedure
All assessments were carried out during school hours. The tests to assess reading
comprehension and nonverbal reasoning were administered groupwise in two sessions of
40 minutes each. All participating children of one school sat together in one room to make
these tests silently. The other assessments were performed on an individual basis and were
administrated in two separate sessions by the ﬁrst author and two trained master students.
Individual testing was carried out in a separate room, provided by the schools. In the ﬁrst
individual session, performance on text reading prosody and speech prosody was assessed
and three tasks not discussed in the current paper. The order of the two narratives and the
two story cards was counter-balanced. During the second session, performance on word
recognition, pseudoword decoding, vocabulary and the subtasks of the PEPS-C computer
task was assessed.
Data analyses
Firstly, data were visually inspected, and skewness and kurtosis values (Table 1) and the
Shapiro–Wilk test were examined to determine whether the data were normally distributed.

The speech rhythm (receptive: chronological-age controls W = 0.75, p < .001,
comprehension-level controls W = 0.81, p = .001; expressive: comprehension-level
controls W = 0.78, p < .001), stress placement (receptive: chronological-age controls
W = 0.71, p < .001, poor comprehenders W = 0.83, p < .001, comprehension-level
controls W = 0.81, p < .001; expressive: chronological-age controls W = 0.75, p < .001,
poor comprehenders W = 0.91, p = .049) and word boundaries (receptive: chronological-
age controls W = 0.83, p = .002, poor comprehenders W = 0.89, p = .025) variables, as well
as nonverbal reasoning (chronological-age controls W = 0.83, p = .002, poor
comprehenders W = 0.90, p = .04, comprehension-level controls W = 0.78, p < .001), were
not normally distributed, characterised mostly by negative skew, and transformation did
not solve this. We therefore used a non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis) to determine
group differences for these variables. In a second step, we examined correlations between
variables (non-parametric where appropriate) to inform a multinomial logistic regression to
determine whether prosody measures accounted for unique variance in predicting group
membership (poor comprehenders vs chronological-age controls and poor comprehenders
vs comprehension-level controls), when variation in nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary and
word recognition2 were taken into account. To constrain the number of variables in the
model in light of our modest sample size, only prosody measures that showed signiﬁcant
correlations with reading comprehension were added to the model including the control
variables (nonverbal reasoning and vocabulary) as well as word recognition.
Results
Descriptive statistics for all measures are presented in Table 1.
Group differences in reading, vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning
There were group differences on the scores of the reading comprehension task, as expected,
F(2,60) = 32.52, p < .001, ω = .58. The reading comprehension scores were similar for the
poor comprehenders and for the younger, comprehension-level control group, t(20) = 0.96,
p = .339, r = .21, but the poor comprehenders scored signiﬁcantly lower than the
chronological-age control group, t(20) = 7.42, p < .001, r = .86. Differences between
the three groups on word recognition were marginally signiﬁcant, F(2,60) = 3.00,
p = .058, ω = .24). Chronological-age controls showed marginally higher scores than poor
comprehenders, t(20) = 1.75, p = .085, r = .36, and comprehension-level controls showed
signiﬁcantly higher scores than poor comprehenders, t(20) = 2.36, p = .02, r = .47. The
groups did not differ on pseudoword decoding, F(2,60) = 0.67, p = .515, ω = .13. Further,
there were signiﬁcant group differences on the productive vocabulary test, F(2,60) = 3.69,
p = .031, ω = .28. Poor comprehenders had signiﬁcantly lower scores on the vocabulary
test than the chronological-age control group, t(20) = 2.66, p = .010, r = .51, and margin-
ally lower scores than the comprehension-level control group, t(20) = 1.82, p = .074,
r = .38. Nevertheless, all children performed within the average range for their age, accord-
ing to norms. There were also signiﬁcant group differences on the percentile scores on the
Raven; the nonverbal reasoning test, H(2,63) = 14.81, p = .001. Poor comprehenders had
lower scores on this test than the chronological-age controls (p = .003) and also lower
scores than the younger, comprehension-level controls (p = .003).

Group differences in prosody measures
Group differences were found on the reading-related prosody task, that is, text reading
prosody, F(2,60) = 16.36, p < .001, ω = .57. Poor comprehenders achieved signiﬁcantly
lower scores on text reading prosody than the chronological-age control group,
t(20) = 4.00, p < .001, r = .67, but similar scores to the comprehension-level control group,
t(20) = 1.54, p = .130, r = .33. The results of the performance on the speech prosody
tasks, ﬁrstly storytelling prosody, also showed group differences, F(2,60) = 12.49,
p < .001, ω = .52. Poor comprehenders had a weaker performance on storytelling prosody
than the chronological-age controls, t(20) = 3.53, p < .001, r = .62, but a similar
performance to the younger comprehension-level controls, t(20) = 1.30, p = .200,
r = .28. The results on the other speech prosody tasks, that is, the PEPS-C tasks, showed
that there were group differences on all tasks, except one; on the receptive stress placement
task, only marginally signiﬁcant group differences were found, H(2,63) = 5.94, p = .051.
The chronological-age control group scored at ceiling level on this task, with a high median
score and a small range (Mdn = 16/16, Range = 12–16), whereas the scores from the poor
comprehenders and the comprehension-level control group had a wider range. Group
differences were found on the expressive stress placement task, H(2,63) = 7.71,
p = .021, the receptive word boundary task, H(2,63) = 11.15, p = .004, and the expressive
speech rhythm task, H(2,63) = 6.48, p = .039. Pairwise comparisons showed that poor
comprehenders scored signiﬁcantly lower than the chronological-age control group
(p = .027, p = .006, p = .036, respectively) but similar to the comprehension-level control
group (p = .105, p = 1.00, p = .325, respectively) on these tasks. Finally, groups also scored
signiﬁcantly different on the receptive speech rhythm task, H(2,63) = 11.68, p = .003. On
this task, poor comprehenders scored lower than the chronological-age control group
(p = .006) but also lower than the younger, comprehension-level control group (p = .015).
Logistic regression
Parametric and non-parametric correlations (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) are
presented in Table 2.
Reading comprehension, vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning, but not word recognition
or pseudoword decoding, were signiﬁcantly associated with prosody measures, which were
also partly associated with each other.
To examine whether prosody measures accounted for unique variance in predicting
group
membership
(poor
comprehenders
vs
chronological-age
controls
vs
comprehension-level controls), when variation in nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary and
word recognition were taken into account, multinomial logistic regression was carried
out. First, we created a model with the control variables (nonverbal reasoning and vocab-
ulary) and word recognition as predictors (Table 3). This model was signiﬁcant,
X2(2) = 20.55, p < .01, but the explained variance was low (McFadden R2 = .15). Nonver-
bal reasoning was the only signiﬁcant predictor in both the comparison of poor
comprehenders
versus
chronological-age
controls,
and
the
comparison
of
poor
comprehenders versus comprehension-level controls. Based on the correlations, several
prosody measures were subsequently included. When performance on the text reading
prosody task, storytelling prosody task, expressive stress placement task and the receptive
word boundaries task were added (Table 4), this resulted in a signiﬁcant model ﬁt,
X2(2) = 70.77, p < .01, and a higher amount of explained variance (McFadden

R2 = .51). In the comparison of poor comprehenders versus chronological-age controls,
performance on the text reading prosody task and the receptive word boundaries task
was
signiﬁcant
predictors.
In
the
comparison
of
poor
comprehenders
versus
comprehension-level controls, performance on the nonverbal reasoning task and on the
storytelling prosody task was signiﬁcant predictors, whereas performance on the expres-
sive stress placement task was marginally signiﬁcant.
Discussion
In the current study, we examined to what extent poor comprehenders differed in their
prosodic abilities across written and spoken modalities from a chronological-age control
group and a younger, comprehension-level control group, in order to disentangle the
contribution of decoding skills to the association between prosody and reading compre-
hension. The ﬁrst main result was that, despite having age-appropriate decoding efﬁ-
ciency, poor comprehenders were outperformed on the text reading prosody task by
the chronological-age control group. Indeed, text reading prosody performance predicted
group membership in the logistic regression, even when variance in nonverbal reasoning,
vocabulary and word recognition was taken into account. In fact, their performance on
text reading prosody was in line with the performance of the younger, comprehension-
level control group. This suggests that although decoding may be necessary for text read-
ing prosody performance, it is, in itself, not sufﬁcient for text reading prosody to
develop.
This
conclusion
is
reinforced
by
the
second
main
result
that
poor
comprehenders performed weaker than the chronological-age controls, but similar to
the comprehension-level controls, on most speech prosody tasks. While accounting for

the ability to produce appropriate prosody might restrict reading comprehension
development.
Reading comprehension is a complex process that requires children to quickly and accu-
rately recognise the words in a text (‘the automaticity aspect’) while simultaneously
constructing meaning. It has been proposed that reading ﬂuency – as a combination of
accuracy, automaticity and text reading prosody – facilitates the reader’s construction of
meaning (Kuhn et al., 2010). The results from the current study, however, suggest that
the ‘automaticity aspect’ of reading is a distinct process from the construction of meaning.
The construction of meaning seems more closely tied to text reading prosody than to
decoding efﬁciency, at least, when children have mastered automaticity in reading. The
theoretical rationale behind this is that text reading prosody may facilitate the uniﬁcation

between the retrieved words on a phonological, syntactic and semantic level. This is in line
with neurocognitive models of language processes that propose that memory retrieval and
uniﬁcation processes comprise two distinct brain areas that operate in parallel (Hagoort,
2007). This proposed facilitation in uniﬁcation processes could have implications for the
construct of text reading ﬂuency in relation to reading comprehension. We suggest that
in mature readers that have automatised decoding, assessment of text reading ﬂuency
should always include the component of text reading prosody. Text reading prosody per-
formance could provide an insight in how well a child manages to unify the phonological,
syntactic and semantic levels, and therefore, how well he or she constructs meaning from
the text.
The second main result concerns the performance on the speech prosody tasks, partly
distinguishing poor comprehenders from both chronological-age and comprehension-
level controls, and provides further evidence for a relation between prosody and reading
comprehension. Deﬁciencies in perceiving and producing speech prosody in poor
comprehenders – as is evident on some of the speech prosody tasks – could obstruct
the use of implicit prosody (an inner representation of what a text should sound like)
while reading a text silently. It has been suggested that implicit prosody may facilitate
text comprehension (Kentner, 2012; Kuhn et al., 2010; T. Rasinski et al., 2009). Fodor
(1998, 2002) proposed the implicit prosody hypothesis stating that a default prosodic
contour is projected onto a text, in order to help solve syntactic ambiguity when reading
silently.
The
results
from
the
current
study
raise
the
question
whether
poor
comprehenders may not have access to a default prosodic contour. Given that the results
of the groups’ comparisons and the logistic regression gave somewhat inconsistent re-
sults, it is not entirely clear which aspects of prosody are affected in poor
comprehenders. Although group comparisons suggested that poor comprehenders per-
formed more poorly than chronological-age controls on most speech prosody measures,
only performance on the receptive word boundaries subtask (indicating the ability to
successfully discriminate between ‘Chocolate-cake and jam’ vs ‘Chocolate, cake and
jam’) predicted group membership in the logistic regression. When comparing poor
comprehenders with comprehension-level controls, only storytelling prosody predicted
group membership. It is likely that shared variance across prosody tasks and with non-
verbal reasoning and vocabulary skills partly explains these inconsistencies. Further re-
search, using tasks and designs that carefully control differential reliance on wider
language and memory skills across different aspects of prosody, is required to clarify
which aspects of prosody may be consistently delayed and/or impaired in poor
comprehenders.
Although the prosodic abilities of poor comprehenders have, as far as we know, not been
examined before, a considerable body of research has investigated speech-language prob-
lems in poor comprehenders. It has been shown that poor comprehenders have weaker
grammatical, syntactic and semantic skills (Nation, Clarke, Marshall, & Durand, 2004;
Nation & Snowling, 2000). The current study adds an impairment in prosody skills in this
group. It would be interesting to investigate relations between prosody and grammatical,
syntactic and semantic skills in poor comprehenders in future research, as it has been
proposed that one of the functions of prosody is the attribution of syntactic roles to words
within sentences (Chafe, 1988; Koriat, Greenberg, & Kreiner, 2002). Furthermore, an
appropriate use and understanding of prosody may assist in segmenting a sentence into
syntactically and semantically correct chunks (Kintsch, 1998; Snedeker & Trueswell,
2003; Snedeker & Yuan, 2008).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

Importantly, longitudinal research showed that the weaker grammatical, syntactic and
semantic skills in poor comprehenders are persisting and can, in retrospect, be related
to speech-language impairments in earlier school years (Catts et al., 2006; Nation
et al., 2010). Because speech prosody develops well before learning to read, it seems
plausible to assume that delays in prosodic development may be observed well before
poor comprehenders start to fail at reading comprehension. This could potentially pro-
vide valuable information for early language screening, as delayed development in
speech prosody skills may hinder later reading comprehension. The relation between
prosody and reading comprehension would be in line with the developmental trajectory
of speech prosody and its inﬂuence on later literacy development, such as phonological
and morphological awareness, as outlined by Zhang and McBride-Chang (2010). Future
studies, however, are needed to further examine the relation between early speech pros-
ody and later reading comprehension and the potential of this for early screening
possibilities.
The fact that some subtasks of the PEPS-C had a low internal reliability is a limitation of
the study, and this means that the ﬁndings of the current study need to be interpreted with
some caution. Possibly, reduced range in scores on some of them contributed to the low
internal reliability. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that there are currently very few
highly reliable measures of prosodic sensitivity (Holliman et al., 2014). A second
limitation of the study concerns the signiﬁcant group differences in nonverbal reasoning,
vocabulary and word recognition that were not controlled for in the non-parametric
ANOVAs. As a consequence, those group comparison should be interpreted with caution.
Nevertheless, both text reading prosody and some speech prosody measures were found to
predict group membership in subsequent logistic regression models in which these
variables were taken into account. In future work, the use of non-parametric analyses of
covariance (Akritas, Arnold, & Du, 2000) in group comparisons, or the use of a regression
model (see for instance, Tong, Deacon, Kirby, Cain, & Parrila, 2011) to identify those
children who struggle with comprehension, rather than a case-control design, would more
easily allow for control of nonverbal reasoning and language skills. Finally, analysing the
acoustic proﬁle of children’s prosody in future work would be a useful addition to the use
of the Multidimensional Fluency Scale. The current study is the ﬁrst to examine prosodic
abilities in poor comprehenders, and the results should therefore be taken as a ﬁrst step.
Further research is needed to conﬁrm these results and to examine differences in prosody
development in more depth.
Conclusion
The current study provides evidence for a delay in both text reading prosody and speech
prosody in poor comprehenders, compared with typical readers of the same age. Because
poor comprehenders have age-appropriate decoding skills but weak reading comprehen-
sion skills, we were able to show that decoding efﬁciency in itself is not sufﬁcient to
establish the relation between text reading prosody and reading comprehension. It is
therefore proposed that text reading prosody may be more strongly related to the level of
reading comprehension. This was also shown by our ﬁnding that poor comprehenders
had impairments in speech prosody. Poor perception and production of speech prosody
may hinder an internal representation of what a text should sound like, which is suggested
to obstruct comprehension of written text.

Notes
1. In these national assessments, the word recognition test reﬂected timed single-word
reading, whereas in the reading comprehension assessment, children were asked to
answer multiple-choice comprehension questions about several texts. As such, these
measures were highly similar in terms of the procedures as the word recognition and
reading comprehension measures administered by us and described in the succeeding
text. The items used in the assessments were completely different though.
2. We chose to include word recognition rather than pseudoword decoding because the
groups differed on the former, but not the latter. The same variables predicted group
membership though, when pseudoword decoding was included instead of word
recognition.
