In 1926 Erwin Schr¨odinger published a consistent mathematical theory of quantum
mechanics, which became known as wave mechanics. He developed a partial dif-
ferential equation, the  Schr¨odinger equation, which now is considered the basic
equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Although wave mechanics was
soon shown to be equivalent to  matrix mechanics, the competing theory of
quantum mechanics developed by Werner Heisenberg in 1925, many physicists fa-
vored wave mechanics, because they considered it more intuitive and because the
 Schr¨odinger equation was often easier to solve than the Heisenberg equation.
The Schr¨odinger equation,
(−ℏ2/(2m))∇2ψ(r, t) + U(r, t)ψ(r, t) = iℏ∂ψ(r, t)/∂t,
describes the time evolution of the wave function ψ(r,t) which characterizes a non-
relativistic particle of mass m, without internal structure, whose potential energy is
given by U(r, t). It can be generalized to a many-body equation

i ψ(r1, r2, . . . , t)]
+U(r1, r2, . . . , t)ψ(r1, r2, . . . , t) = iℏ∂ψ(r1, r2, . . . , t)/∂t.
Consider a single particle. The  wave function ψ(r, t) contains all the informa-
tion the rest of the world, called the observer, can have about the particle at time t,
without interacting with the particle. An interaction is called a  measurement. It
changes the information the observer has about the particle and therefore changes
the wave function. Between measurements the wave function evolves determini-
stically.
The wave function is interpreted as the probability amplitude of the particle’s
presence. |ψ(r, t)|2 is the probability density. ( Born rule) The probability that
a particle at time t will be found in a volume element d3r located about r is

dP(r, t) = |ψ(r, t)|2d3r. For a single particle the total probability of ﬁnding it
anywhere in space at time t is equal to 1. (In non-relativistic Quantum Mechan-
ics material particles, unlike photons ( light quantum), are neither created nor
destroyed.) Therefore

all space
|ψ (r, t)) |2d3r = 1.
A proper wave function must be square-integrable and therefore normalizable.
The Schr¨odinger equation implies local conservation of probability. The proba-
bility current density is given by
j(r, t) = 1

ψ∗(r, t) ℏ

,
and the equation
−∂
∂t |ψ (r, t) |2 = ∇· j (r, t) ,
which expresses local conservation of probability, can be obtained multiplying the
Schr¨odinger equation by ψ*(r,t) and its complex conjugate by −ψ(r,t) and adding
the two equations.
To make predictions about the outcome of a measurement, we must operate on
the wave function with an  operator. Every measurable quantity or observable is
associated with a Hermitian operator. For example, the operator for the x-component
of the momentum px is the differential operator (ℏ/i)∂/∂x. We have to take the par-
tial derivative of the wave function with respect to x and then multiply by (ℏ/i). The
operator for the energy E is iℏ∂/∂t. It is also a differential operator. The operator
for the position x is x. We have to multiply the wave function by x. If the opera-
tor for a particular observable A operates on a wave function ψ(r, t) and the result
of this operation is the wave function ψ(r, t) multiplied by a real constant, then
the wave function is said to be an eigenfunction of the operator and the constant is
one of its eigenvalues. A measurement of the observable at time t will for certain
yield the eigenvalue. There will be no uncertainty about the outcome of the mea-
surement. If the operator for a particular observable A operates on a wave function
ψ(r, t) and the result of this operation is NOT the wave function ψ(r, t) multiplied
by a real constant, then the wave function is NOT an eigenfunction of the operator
and there is uncertainty about the outcome of a measurement. The result of every
measurement of an observable will be one of its eigenvalues. But if the wave func-
tion ψ(r, t) is NOT an eigenfunction of the operator, then all we can predict is the
probability of measuring any of the possible eigenvalues. We then can predict the
average value of repeated measurements on identically prepared systems, but we
cannot predict the outcome of an individual measurement.
Given the normalized wave function ψ(r, t), the expression for the mean value
of an observable A is < A >=

d3rψ∗(r, t) Aψ (r, t).

Wave Mechanics
The root mean square deviation A =
√
< A2 > −< A >2 characterizes the
dispersion of the measurement around < A >. It is a measure of the spread that one
should expect in the result of a measurement of the observable A.
The principle of spectral decomposition states that any wave function ψ(r, t) can
be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctionsof any observable. Let {ψ i
a (r)} denote the
set of orthonormal eigenfunctions of the observable A, and let A ψ i
a (r) = aψ i
a (r).
If the eigenvalue a is degenerate, then the superscript i denotes different eigenfunc-
tions with the same eigenvalue a. Any wave function ψ(r, t) can be written as
ψ (r, t) =

a,i
ci
a(t)ψi
a (r) , with

a,i
|ci
a(t)|2 = 1.
The ci
a(t) are the expansion coefﬁcients. If the observable A is measured, the
result of the measurement will belong to the set of eigenvalues {a}. Spectral
decomposition, see  Density operator; Ignorance interpretation; Measurement the-
ory; Objectiﬁcation; Operator; Probabilistic Interpretation; Propensities in Quantum
Mechanics; Self-adjoint operator.
The probability that a measurement of A at time t will yield the eigenvalue a′ is

If a measurement of A yields a′, then the wave function immediately after the mea-
surement is ψa′ (r, t) = 

The Schr¨odinger equation describes how the wave function evolves between
measurements. To determine the wave function ψ(r, t0) at some initial time t0, we
have to measure a complete set of commuting observables, i.e., a set of observables
that have a unique set of common eigenfunctions. The results of the measurements
at t0 then specify the wavefunction ψ(r, t0) completely.
The Schr¨odinger equation for a particle moving in one dimension through a re-
gion where its potential energy is a function of position only has the form
(−ℏ2/(2m))∇2ψ(r, t) + U(r)ψ(r, t) = iℏ∂ψ(r, t)/∂t.
We are often interested in ﬁnding the eigenfunctions of the energy operator
iℏ∂/∂t, i.e., we are interested in ﬁnding the wave functions of a particle whose en-
ergy can be predicted with certainty. For an eigenfunction of the energy operator we
have
iℏ∂ψ(r, t)/∂t = Eψ(r, t).
Therefore
ψ(r, t) = ψ(r)exp(−iEt/ℏ).
For eigenfunctions of the energy operator the Schr¨odinger equation becomes time
independent.
(−ℏ2/(2m))∇2ψ(r) + U(r)ψ(r) = Eψ(r, t).

The operator (−ℏ2/(2m))∇2 + U(r) is called the Hamiltonian operator H, and
the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation is often abbreviated as
Hψ(r) = Eψ(r).
The possible solutions ψ(r) of the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation are
the eigenfunctions of the  Hamiltonian operator. The corresponding wave func-
tions ψ(r, t) are obtained by just multiplying ψ(r) by exp(−iEt/ℏ), where E is the
appropriate eigenvalue for each eigenfunction of H. The wave function of a parti-
cle whose energy E can be predicted with certainty is of the form ψ(r, t) = ψ(r)
exp(-iEt/ℏ).
The probability density then is given by
|ψ(r, t)|2 = ψ(r)exp(−iEt/ℏ)ψ∗(r)exp(iEt/ℏ) = |ψ(r)|2.
The probability of ﬁnding the particle with well deﬁned energy at a particular
position r is therefore independent of time. The probability current density is zero.
The particle is said to be in a stationary state.
The Schr¨odinger equation is a linear equation. There exists a linear operator that
transforms ψ(r, t0) into ψ(r, t).
ψ(r, t) = U(t, t0)ψ(r, t0).
The operator U(t, t0) is called the evolution operator. The evolution operator
is a unitary operator. If H does not explicitly depend on time, then the Schr¨odinger
equation yields U(t, t0) = exp(−iH(t −t0)/ℏ). If an arbitrary wavefunction ψ(r, t0)
is expanded in terms of eigenfunctions of H, i.e., if
ψ(r, t0) =

n
cnψn(r),
with Hψn(r) = Enψn(r), then
ψ(r, t) =

n
cnexp(−iEn(t −t0)/ℏ)ψn(r) =

n
cn(t)ψn(r).
This yields the wave function at any time t.
A simple example:
Assume we want to solve the Schr¨odinger equation in one dimension,
(−ℏ2/(2m))∂2ψ(x)/∂x2 + U(x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x).
Deﬁning k2
1 = 2mE/ℏ2, k0(x)2 = 2mU(x)/ℏ2, and k(x)2 = k2
1 −k0(x)2 we
can simplify the notation.
∂2ψ(x)/∂x2 + k(x)2ψ(x) = 0,

826
Wave Mechanics
Let us solve this equation for the “inﬁnite square well.” We assume U(x) = 0
for x = 0 to L, and U(x) = inﬁnite everywhere else. A particle cannot penetrate a
region with inﬁnite potential energy, there is no chance that we can ﬁnd it there, and
its wave function in that region is zero. We put the particle in a one-dimensional box,
out of which it has no chance of escaping. In the region from x = 0 to x = L the
potential energy U(x) = 0. The particle can freely move inside the box. Therefore
k0(x) = 0 and k(x)2 = k2
1. Possible wave functions for the particle must satisfy the
equation
∂2ψ(x)/∂x2 + k2ψ(x) = 0,
and they must be zero at x = 0 and x = L, because the eigenfunctions of H must be
continuous and the wave function is zero outside the region from x = 0 to x = L.
Real solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation which are zero at x = 0 and x = L
are ψ(x) = A sin(kx), with kL = nπ, with n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. The possible values
of k are kn = nπ/L, the possible values of the energy are En = ℏ2k2
n/(2m) =
n2π2ℏ2/(2mL2). The potential and the ﬁrst ﬁve possible energies a particle can have
are shown in Fig. 1. units are used (Fig. 1).
The energy of a particle in an inﬁnite square well is quantized. If we measure
the energy we can only measure one of the eigenvalues, En = n2π2ℏ2/(2mL2),
n = 1, 2, 3,.... The conﬁnement of the particle leads to energy  quantization. If
we measure En, then right after the measurement the wave function of the particle is
ψn(x, t) = An sin(nπx/L)exp(−iEnt/ℏ).
The square of the normalized wave function |ψn(x, t)|2 = |ψn(x)|2 = A2
nsin2
(nπx/L) is equal to the probability per unit length of ﬁnding the particle with energy
En at position x. To normalize the wave function we have to choose A2
n = 2/L.
Then ∫+∞
−∞|ψ(x, t)|2dx = 1, and the total probability of ﬁnding the particle inside
the well is 1.
A particle in an inﬁnite square well does not have to be in an eigenstate of the
energy operator. If we measure the position of a particle in the well and ﬁnd it at

particle in a 1D “inﬁnite
square well”

some position x, then right after the measurement the particle is in an eigenstate of
the position operator. Its energy is unknown, we can at most determine its average
energy and the probability of measuring one of its eigenenergies in a subsequent
measurement. Right after our measurement, the particle is in a  superposition of
energy eigenstates. Let us investigate one of those superpositions.
Assume a particle of mass m moves in one dimension in a square well with walls
of inﬁnite height a distance L apart and that the particle is known to be in a state
consisting of an equal admixture of the two lowest energy eigenstates of the system.
P(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|2 is the probability per unit length of ﬁnding the particle at
position x as a function of time.
ψ(x, t) = 2−1/2[ψ1(x, t) + ψ2(x, t)], with
ψ1(x, t) = (2/L)1/2 sin(πx/L) exp(−(i/ℏ)E1t),
ψ2(x, t) = (2/L)1/2 sin(2πx/L) exp(−(i/ℏ)E2t),
and E1 = π2ℏ2/(2mL2), E2 = 4π2ℏ2/(2mL2).
Therefore
|ψ(x, t)|2 = (1/2)|ψ1(x, t) + ψ2(x, t)|2
= (1/L)| sin(πx/L) exp(−(i/ℏ)E1t) + sin(2πx/L) exp(−(i/ℏ)E2t)|2
= (1/L)[sin2(πx/L) + sin2(2πx/L)
+2 sin(πx/L) sin(2πx/L) cos((E2 −E1)t/ℏ)].
P(x, t) is no longer independent of time, the probability per unit length of ﬁnding
the particle at x is changing with time. The probability current density at position
x is
j(x, t) = (ℏ/m)Re((−i)ψ∗(x, t)∇(ψ(x, t)
= (πℏ/(mL2)) sin(πx/L)(1 −cos(2πx/L)) sin((E2 −E1)t/ℏ)
and we can verify that −∂|ψ(x, t)|2/∂t = ∂j(x, t)|/∂x.
