Preface 
The seminar Symplectic Geometry at the University of Berne in summer 1992 
showed that the topic of this book is a very active field, where many different 
branches of mathematics come tog9ther: differential geometry, topology, partial 
differential equations, variational calculus, and complex analysis. As usual in 
such a situation, it may be tedious to collect all the necessary ingredients. The 
present book is intended to give the nonspecialist a solid introduction to the 
recent developments in symplectic and contact geometry. 
Chapter 1 gives a review of the symplectic group Sp(n,R), sympkctic 
manifolds, and Hamiltonian systems (last but not least to fix the notations). 
The 1\Iaslov index for closed curves as well as arcs in Sp(n, R) is discussed. 
This index will be used in chapters 5 and 8. 
Chapter 2 contains a more detailed account of symplectic manifolds start-
ing with a proof of the Darboux theorem saying that there are no local in-
variants in symplectic geometry. The most important examples of symplectic 
manifolds will be introduced: cotangent spaces and Kahler manifolds. Finally 
we discuss the theory of coadjoint orbits and the Kostant-Souriau theorem, 
which are concerned with the question of which homogeneous spaces carry a 
symplectic structure. 
Chapter 3 is devoted to the theory of generating functions, an important 
tool for dealing with Lagrange submanifolds and their intersections. The in-
tersection problem for Lagrange manifolds. is a generalization of the problem 
of finding (or counting) the fixed points of a s~·mplectomorphism. Here the 
minimax principle and Lusternik-Schnirelman theory can be used and will be 
explained. Generating functions also lead to a symplectic invariant, called the 
Viterbo capacity. 
In Chapter 4 symplectic capacities will be discussed. For this one first 
has to deal with periodic trajectories in Hamiltonian systems. The variational 
method makes it possible to identify these closed trajectories with the crit-
ical points of the action functional defined on a loop space. Leray-Schauder 
degree theory will then be applied to prove an existence theorem for closed 

X 
Preface 
trajectories. This theorem (or rather its proof) is then used to show that the 
Hofer-Zehnder capacity has all the properties required of a symplectic capac-
ity. Roughly. this capacity measures how large a positive Hamiltonian which 
is zero on an open set can get without creating nonconstant periodic solution:; 
with period less than one. Gromov's squeezing theorem and some rigidity re-
sults for sympleetomorphisms will be derived from thf' existence of a symplectic 
capacity. 
In Chapter 5 WC' discuss Floct·'s proof of the Arnol'd conjecture. In order 
to understand this, one first has to study ?\Iorse homology. Here one constructs 
a differential complex using the critical points of a ?llorse function f : "U---+ R 
and their connecting trajectories along the gradient flow of f. The homology 
of this complex is called ?\Iorse homology and it is isomorphic to the (singular) 
homology of the manifold Af. This will be shown with the aid of the Conley 
index of isolated invariant sets (in a gradient dynamical system). As a corollary 
the classical l\Iorse inequalities evolve. They imply that the number of critical 
points of f is at least the sum of the Betti numbers of l\1. 
Arnol'd conjectured that every exact symplectomorphism of a symplectic 
manifold 1\1 has at least as many fixed points as a smooth function on AI has 
critical points. An exact symplectomorphism is the timc-1 map of a 1-periodic 
time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field. Its fixed points therefore correspond 
to 1-periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian equation. Since by the variational 
method these periodic solutions are identified with the critical points of the 
action functional, one has to count critical points, as in ?\Iorse theory. But 
instead of a Morse function one now has a functional on an infinite dimensional 
space, the loop space. In spite of the mathematical difficulties Floer was able to 
construct an analog of the Morse complex in many casC's. Its homology is now 
called Floer homology. Using a deformation to a time independent Hamiltonian 
one then shows that Floer homology agrees with Morse homology. This proves 
the Arnol'd conjecture. 
Chapter 6 is an introduction to pscudoholomorphic curws in a symplec-
tic manifold. To a s~·mplectic form on a manifold a natural family of almost 
complex structures is associated, imitating the relationship between hermitian 
forms and Kahler forms on Kahler manifolds. Although these almost complex 
structures in general do not define an honest complex structure of the mani-
fold, one-dimensional complex submanifolds exist. The study of these (pseudo-) 
holomorphic cnrves yields a powerful tool for proving theorems on symplectic 
manifolds. We try to give a self-contained presentation of the fundamental 
construction of the muduli space of parametrized closed holomorphic curves 
and its simplest compactness properties. The moduli-space is constructed with 
the Sard-Smalc theorem and the compactness is investigated via a differential 
geometric approach relying on a Sachs-Uhlcnbeck argument and a l\Iorrey in-
equality. At the end we show how pseudoholornorphic curves can be used to 
prove the so-called squeezing theorem. 

Preface 
xi 
In Chapter 7 the compactne~s theorem for pseudoholomorphic curves is 
taken up again, but this time from a more geometrical point of view. It can 
be read independently of Chapter 6. Essentially, Gromov's original proof as 
worked out by P. Pansu and C. Hmnrncl will be sketched. This approach of-
fers the advantage of being geometrically intuitive and displays the analogy to 
function theoretic methods. Pscudoholomorphic analogs of the Schwarz lemma, 
of the ·weierstrass theorem, and of a well-known monotonicity property will be 
formulated. 
To make the notion of cusp-curves precise, a delicate notion of convergence 
will be studied. It is clm;cly related to convergence of hyperbolic structures on 
Riemann surfaces (using Fcnchel-Niclscn parameters). For this, deformations 
of Riemann surfaces arc studied. 
Contact structures are the odd-dimensional counterpart to symplectic 
structures. They naturally appear in many·ways in symplectic geometry: first 
of all as certain integral surfaces of Hamiltonian systems, and then, in the 
context of complex analysis, as strictly pseudoconvex hypcrsurfaces. The pro-
cess of symplectification provides a direct link between contact and symplectic 
geometry. In Chapter 8 we consider contact structures, first from a general 
point of view and then with special emphasis on complex analytic methods 
in 3-dimcnsional contact geometry. We study topological invariants of two-
dimensional manifolds embedded in 3-dimcnsional contact or 4-dimcnsional 
symplectic manifolds and we present Eliashberg·s classification results.

Introduction 
1.1 
Symplectic Linear Algebra 
An even dimensional real vector space V is called symplectic if on V we have 
a skew-symmetric and non-degeneate bilinear form w. 1\Iore precisely, we say 
that w is non-degenerate if w(x, y) = 0 for all y E V implies x = 0. A linear 
map f: V1 -> Vz between two symplectic vector spaces (V1,wt) and (Vz,wz) i~ 
symplectir if f*wz = w1, i.e. if 
w1 (x, y) = wz(f(x), f(y)) for all x, y E V1. 
The standard example of a symplectic vector space is V = R2" with 
the canonical symplectic form given by w(x,y) = (Jx,y) where(·,·) is the 
Euclidean inner product of R 2" and J is the 2n x 2n-matrix 
J= ( 
0 
-lnxn 
lnxn ) 
0 
. 
Thus if :r = (x1, ... , X2n), y = (yl, ... , Yzn) E V we get 
w(x,y) = LXi+nYi- XiYi+n· 
i=l 
Moreover, this is essentially the only example of a symplectic vector space. 
More precisely, if (V, w) is symplectic we can always find a canonical basis 
el, ... ,e,.,ft, ... ,fn of V such that w(e;,ej) = w(fi.fJ) = 0, w(e;,/j) = bij· 
The standard basis e1 = (0, ... , 0, 1, 0, ... , 0), ... , ft = (1. 0, ... , 0, ... , 0), ... satisfies 
these conditions in the case of V = R 2". 
It is now clear that two symplectic vector spaces V1, Vz of the same di-
mension 2n are isomorphic: Choosing symplectic bases ei, .. , e~, f~, ... , f~ in 
V;, i = 1. 2. we get a symplectic isomorphismS between V1 and Vz by setting 
Se} = e],Sf] = f],j = l, ... ,n. 
For any subspace W of a symplectic vector space V denote by fV .l the 
w-orthogonal subspace of H' 
W.l = {x E V: w(x,y) = 0 Vy E W}. 
A subspace is called isotropic if W C W .l, coisotropic if W .l C W and La-
grangian if H' = W .l. An isotropic subspace is Lagrangian if and only if its 
dimension is maximal, i.e. if dim W = n. 
The set of all sy!jnplectic transformations of R 2" forms a group under 
composition. the symplectic group Sp(n, R). In particular, J E Sp(n, R). For a 
2n x 2n-matrix A with respect to a canonical basis { e;, Ji} of R 2" the condition 
for A E Sp(n, R) reads 

2 
1 Introduction 
Writing A = (A;j ). where A;i (j = 1, 2) are n x n-matrices, one has A E 
Sp(n,R) if and only if AEA21 and A[2A22 are symmetric and AEA22-
Ar1A12 = Inxn· 
From AT J A= J one concludes det A= ±1. In fact, all symplectic matri-
ces have determinant one. To see this, consider the exterior power 0 = w/\ ... 1\w 
with n factors. Since w is nondegenerate, 0 is a volume form. ?\ow if A*w = w 
one also has A* 0 = 0, which implies det A = 1. 
We have the following 
Theorem 1.1 (Symplectic eigenvalue theorem) If .A is an eigenvalue of 
a symplectic matrix A with multiplicity k, then 1/ .A,.\ 1/5.. are also eigenvalues 
of A; especially 1/ .A occurs with multiplicity k. 
Proof. Let p{.A) = det(A - .AI) be the characteristic polynomial of A. From 
J AJ-1 = (A - 1 )T and J-1 = -J we conclude 
p(>.) = det(J(A- >.I)r1) = det(A-1 - >-I)= det(A-1(I- >-A))= 
1 
1 
= det(I- >.A)= >.2n dct{ ).I- A)= .\2np(). ). 
As 0 is not an cigem·alue of A it follows that A - 1 and 5.. arc also eigenvalues 
of A. Suppose now >.0 occurs with multiplicity k. Then p(>.) = (>.- >.0 )kp1(.A) 
with P1 (Ao) # 0. The identity 
shows that fa has multiplicity k, since >.2n-kP10;) does not vanish at .A= fa· 
0 
1.2 
Symplectic Manifolds 
A symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold !vi on which a closed and non-
degenerate 2-form w is given. More precisely, w must satisfy 
1. dw = 0 and 
2. on any tangent space TpM,p E M, we have: if wlr.M(X, Y) = 0 for all 
Y E TpM, then X= 0. 
AI must have even dimension since any tangent space at a point .of 111 
is a symplectic vector space whose bilinear form is given by restriction of the 
symplectic form. In the next chapter we will see that locally all symplectic 
manifolds look the same. This is in sharp contrast to Riemannian geometry. 
Symplectic geometry is essentially a global theory. 

1.2 Symplectic Manifolds 
3 
Not cYcry manifold admits a symplectic structure. All manifolds of odd 
dimension are counter examples. Another example is 11! = 8 4 . Assume w is a 
closed and non-degenerate 2-form on 8 4 • Then "-" is exact, i.e. there exists a 
1-form a with w = da. This follows from the well-known fact that the second 
de Rham cohomology group of 8 4 vanishes, i.e. all closed 2-forms on S 4 arc 
exact. But then also the volume form n = w 1\ w is exact: 
d(w 1\ a) = dw 1\ Q + w 1\ da = w 1\ w = n. 
By Stokes· theorem we have 
j n = j w A a = o. 
5 4 
DS4 
which is is impossible for a volume form. So we sec that on 8 4 we cannot impose 
a symplectic form. 
Recall that to any smooth map between two manifolds Jl,f and N we can 
associate the tangential map T f : T AI --t TN. If 3 is a k-form on N then the 
pullback of 3 to M is defined by 
where p E jf and X1, ... , Xk E TpAI. Recall also the definition of the interior 
product: Let 3 beak-form on M and X a vector field. Then ixf3 = X...J(3 (we 
will use both notations later) is defined to be the k- 1-form 
We are now able to give the global analog of a symplectic linear map: 
Definition 1.2 Let (M,w) and (N,p) be symplectic manifolds. A smooth map-
ping f : M --t N is called symplectic if 
f*p=w. 
Note that iff is a symplectic diffeomorphism, then f- 1 is also symplectic; 
in this case f is called a symplectomorphism. Most important are of course sym-
plectomorphism from AI to itself because they preserve the symplectic struc-
ture. 
The classification of subspaces into isotropic, coisotropic and Lagrangian 
can be taken over to submanifolds of a symplectic manifold. For example, a 
submanifold N of (M, w) is called Lagrangian iffor any point pEN the tangent 
space Tp2\' is a Lagrangian subspace of (TpM,wiTpM ).

1 Introduction 
1.3 
Hamiltonian Systems 
The Hamiltonian vector field of a function H on a symplectic manifold is formed 
in a manner analogous to the gradient in Riemannian geometry. However, the 
skew-symmetry of the symplectic 2-form leads to conservative properties which 
arc totally different from the properties of gradient vector fields. 
Definition 1.3 Let (JI. w) be a symplectic manifold and H: M ___, R a :mwoth 
fnnct·ion. The vector field X H on 1\I determined by the conditwn 
w(Xu, ·) = dH(·) 
(1.1) 
is called the Hamiltonian vector fidel with energy fnnrtion H. 
The non-degeneracy of w guarantees that Xu exists and is uniquely defined. 
\Vrittcn in local coordinates the condition (1.1) becomes more familiar-
at least for physicists. Let ( qi, ... , q11 , Pi, ... , Pn) be canonical coordinates for 
w, i.e. w = I:; rlp; 1\ dq,. By Darboux' theorem ;;uch coordinates can always be 
found locally ( cf. next chapter). Then ( q( t), p( t)) is an integral curve for X H 
exactly if Hamilton's eqnations hold: 
. 
EiH 
q; = Eip;. 
Indeed, let Xu = (- zu. zu) = -JV H. Then 
PI 
q,

EiH 
EiH 
l:h>~-dp; + -;:;-dq;] = dH. 
up, 
uq, 
Hamiltonian systems arc well-known from classical mechanics. Newton's 
second law states that a particle of mass m moving in a potential V(q), where 
q is a point in confignration space R 3 , moves along a curve q(t) such that 
mfltq = -VV(q).lfwe introduce the mornentump; = mq;, i = 1.2,3, and the 
energy H(p, q) = 2:,1PI 2 + V(q), then Newton's law is equivalent to Hamilton';; 
equations. The mechanical problem can now be investigated in the phase space 
T*R:~ = {(qJ, q2, q3.J!1-J!2-J!3)}. 
From physics we expect conservation of energy. Let c(t) be an integral 
curve for a Hamiltonian vector field Xu on a symplectic manifold. Then we 
have 
d 
. 
dtH(c(t)) = dH(c(t))c(t) = dH(c(t))Xu(c(t)) = 
= w(Xu(c(t)),XH(c(t))) = 0, 

1.3 Hamiltonian Systems 
5 
hence H o c is constant. The integral trajectories of a Hamiltonian system lie 
on energy surfaces H = const. This shows for example that the dynamical sys-
tem given by an irrational winding along the 2-dimensional torus-considered 
as a symplectic manifold-cannot he a Hamiltonian system. l\"cvcrthelcss this 
system is locally Hamiltonian: 
Definition 1.4 A vector field X on a symplectic manifold ( M, w) is called 
locally Hamiltonian if at every po·int p on ,\1 there is a nc1:ghbourhood U of p 
snch that X restricted to U is Hamilton·ian. 
Proposition 1.5 The following statements arc equivalent: 
(i) 
X is locally Hamiltonian. 
(ii) 
X ....Jw is a closed 1-form. 
(iii) The flow of X consists of symplectic maps. 
Proof. X is locally Hamiltonian if and only if X..J:..: is locally exact. By Poinca-
re's lemma \Ye get the equivalence of (i) and (ii). Let f 1 denote the flow of X. 
Since fa w = "''. the maps ft arc symplectic if And only if "fk ft' w = 0. \Ve have 
whL•rc we used Cartan's formula for the Lie dcrivati\'C Lx = ix o d +do ix 
and dw = 0. Thus fit ft'w vanishes exactly if d(X..J~·) = 0, i.e. if X is loC'ally 
Hrmiltonian. 
D 
As a corollary we get the fact that (locally) Hamiltonian vector fields 
preserve the phase volume !1 = w II ... II w ( n times). 
Of course all Hamiltonian systems are locally Hamiltonian. But the con-
verse is not true as the following example shows: Take AI = R 2 \ {0} with 
the symplectic form w = r dr II dB in polar coordinates. Then the vector field 
X= ~-!Jr is locally but not globally Hamiltonian (in fact. X..Jw =dB). Another 
examplc is the above mentioned irrational winding on the torus T 2 . 
Note. however, if Y, Z are locally Hamiltonian vector fields on a symplectic

1 Introduction 
The following observation is a simple but important one: 
Proposition 1. 7 Let H1, H2 : R 2n --> R be two smooth Hamiltonian functions 
on the standard symplectic manifold (R 2n, w0 ) which possess the same energy 
hypersurface at the level a, i.e. C := H1 1(a) = H2 1(a). If the gradients of 
H1 and H2 nowhere vanish on C, then the trajectories of the tu·o Hamiltonian 
systems coincide on C. 
Proof. Let c(t) be an integral trajectory of H 1 on C, i.e. a solution of the 
equation of motion 
c(t) + J'i7H1(c(t)) = o. 
As 'i7 H 1 and 'i7 H2 arc normal to C and nowhere zero, there is a function). given 
by 'i1H2(c(t)) = .\(t)'ilH1(c(t)). Because of .\(t) =/= 0 for all t we can define the 
function h(s) := J; ;...(tJ dt. Set c= coh- 1. As 
ftc 
(coh- 1 )·(~oh- 1 ) 
-J'i1H1(co h- 1 ) · (.\ o h- 1) 
-J'i1H2(co h- 1 ) = -J'i7H2(c), 
we observe that c(t) solves the equations of motion for H2 . 
D 
For two smooth functions on a symplectic manifold 1\l we define the Pois-
son bracket to be 
The Poisson bracket defines a Lie algebra structure on C""(l\1). To see this one 
only has to check Jacobi's identity: 
{!, {g, h}} + {h, {f,g}} + {g, {h,!}} = 0. 
This immediately reduces to the Jacobi identity for the Lie bracket, since 
as follows from the computation 
Lx.(Xh....Jw)- Xh....JLx.w = Lx.(dh) 
d(X9....Jdh) = d({h,g}) = x{h,g)....J:..·. 
where in the first step we have used the identity i[x,Y] = Lx o i}· - iy o Lx. 
Let H, g E ex ( M). Then if ft denotes the flow of X H we have 
ft(g 0 ft) =It XH(g) =-Jt{H,g}, 

1.4 The Maslm' Index

so that g is constant along the trajectories of the Hamiltonian vector field 
exactly if {H. g} := 0. Such a g is called an integral of mob:on 
Generically, Hamiltonian systems do not allow an integral of motion which 
is independent of the Hamiltonian function. In the exceptional case that H 
on a compact 2n-dimensional manifold possesses n independent integrab of 
motion 91 = H, gz, ... , 9n which arc pairwise in involution, i.e. {g, g:J} = 0, 
the trajectories of X II move along n-dimensional tori as was first observed by 
Lionville. Such systems arc called completely integrable. Kolmogorov-Arnold-
1\Ioser the01·.\· (KA:\I) studies the behaviour of Hamiltonian systems which arc 
ncar au integrable one. vVe will not be concerned with KAl\I theory in this 
book. 
1.4 
The Maslov Index 
The fundamental group of the symplectic group is infinite cyclic as we show 
below. Thus to any loop in Sp(n, R) we can associate an integer, the Maslov 
index of the loop. In thi:; paragraph we show how one can associate a l\Iaslov 
index to paths in Sp(n, R) with certain boundary conditions. vVe closely follow 
191] when• the full proofs are presented. Recently Robbin and Salamon [89] 
have generalized the 1\Iaslov index to arbitrary symplectic arcs. 
First we compute the fundamental group of the symplectic group. An easy 
calculation shows that A E S'p(n, R) n 0(2n) if and only if A has the form 
where A[Az ~ ArA1 = 0 and Af At + AJ A2 = I". This is equivalent to 
AcE U(n). where Ac = A 1 +iA2 is a complex n x n-matrix. So we have proved 
Sp(n: R) n 0(2n) ~ U(n). 
From Bott"s periodicity (sec e.g. [77]) we conclude 
and since U(n) is a deformation retract of CL(n, C) (sec below), it follows that 
rrt(U(n)) = r.t(GL(n,C)) ~ Z. 
( 1.2) 
Since Sp(n.R)/U(n) is contractible, we also have rr 1 (Sp(n,R)) ~ Z. It is pos-
sible to find a continuous map {! : Sp(n, R) _, 5 1 which restricts to the deter-
minaut map 
det: U(rt) ~ Sp(n, R) _,5 1 
To sec that U(u) is a deformation retract of GL(n, C) we explicitly con-
struct a retraction map: let A E CL(n, C). I\ow let B =(A* A)-i. We connect 

8 
1 Introduction 
the positive definite hermitian matrix B with the identity, i.e. we choo~c a path 
Bt satisfying B 0 =In and B1 =B. The retraction is now given by At = ABt. 
An alternative approach to prove (1.2) is the following: The map det : 
U(n) --. 5 1 has the homotopy lifting property with respect to any space X. 
i.e. iff: X --. U(n). Ft :X xI__, 5 1 arc continuous maps such that F0 (x) = 
detf(.r), then there is a map ft: X xI__, U(n) such that fo(:r) = f(x) and 
dct ft =Ft. This is equivalent to the existence of a map ft making the following 
diagram COlllmntath·e: 
ft can be given explicitly by ft(x) = 
(~,~~;) 1 /"j(x). This proves that 
dct: U(n)--> 5 1 is a fibration. It is well-known that for fibrations the following 
homotopy sequence is exact (see e.g. [15, p. 209]): 
... --. 1r2(S1) __, 1rl(SU(n))--. 7rJ(U(n)) __, 7rJ(S 1) __, 0. 
Note that SU(n) = det- 1(1) '--' U(n), i.e. SU(n) is the fiber over 1 E 5 1 Since 
SU(n) is simply cormcctcd we can read off 1r1(U(n)) = Z. 
Recall that for a symplectic vector space ( V, w) we define Sp( V, w) to be 
the group of automorphisms A satisfying A*w = w. It can be shown (sec [91]) 
that there exists for any symplectic vector space (V, w) a unique continuous 
mapping 
ev: Sp(V,w)--. 5 1 
which satisfies the following conditions: 
(i) IfT: (V1 ,wJ)--> (l·2.w2 ) is a symplectic isomorphism, then 
(ii) If for A1 E Sp(VJ. _._·J), Az E Sp(Vz, wz) we define A E Sp(V1 x Vz, WJ 8wz) 
to be A(~1 ,6) = (A6,A6). then 
ev,xv2(A) = ev1 (AJ) ev2(A2). 
(iii) For A = ( ~~ -Az) 
A! 
E Sp(n, R) n 0(2n) (sec above) we have 

1.4 The Maslov Index

(iv) If A has no eigenvalues on the unit circle 5' 1. then 
Q\:(A) = ±1. 
For an explicit construction of Qv sec [91]. \Vc denote \\"ith S'p*(n, R) the subset 
of symplectic matrices with no eigenvalue equal to l. i.e. 
S'p*(n,R) ={A E S'p(n,R): det(I- :1.) =J 0}. 
Lemma 1.8 ([91]) (i) S'p*(n,R) has two connected components: 
Sp*(n,R) = S'p+(n,R) u S'p-(n.R), 
where Sp=(n. R) ={A E S'p(n, R): ± det(I- A)> 0}. 
(ii) Any loop in Sp'(n,R) is contTactiblc in S'p(n.R). 
\Vc are now able to give a definition of the ~laslm· index for svmplectic

Obviously(·, ·)H'·2 induces II·IIHu. We define the operator 
by 
(1.3) 
where S(s, t) is a real symmetric n x n matrix continuous in (s. t) and 1-periodic 
in t. We further assume that S(s, t) converges uniformly in t to the limits s+(t) 
or s- (t) as s tends to +oo or -oo; 
lim S(s, t) _, s±(t). 
s-±oc 
Recall the following 
Definition 1.10 A bounded linear operator F : X-> Y, where X, Y are Ba-
nach spaces, is called Fredholm if kerF and coker F = Y /image (F) are finite 
dimensional. The index ofF is given by 
ind F = dim ker F - dim coker F. 
If X, Y are Hilbert spaces we have an adjoint operator F* and it is not difficult 
to show that F is Fredholm precisely if kerF and kerF* are of finite dimension 
and image (F) is closed. The most important property of Fredholm operators 
is the invariance of their index under perturbations. Let :F denote the set of 
Fredholm operators F : X -> Y with the topology induced by the operator 
norm. Then we have the following 
' 
Theorem 1.11 (Dieudonne) The index function ind: :F-> Z is locally con-
stant. 

1.4 The Maslov Index 
11 
However. dimker F need not be locally con;,tant. For a proof see e.g. [60]. 
We will now show that the above defined operator F is indeed Fredholm. 
Observe that to F we can associate a path IJi(s. t) in Sp(n, R) by the first order 
differential equation 
D ( 
. 
Dt IJi .d)= JS(s, t) IJi(s. t) 
together with the initial condition IJi(s, 0) = I. As s tends to ±oo, IJi(.s, t) 
converges to the matrices w±(t) uniformly in t. 
Theorem 1.12 (Salamon-Zehnder) Let the operator F be given by {1.3). 
Assume farther that the paths IJi± ( t) are admissible. Then F is Fredholm. 
To prove this we first need the following tedmical lemma: 
Lemma 1.13 Let X, Y, Z be Banach spaces, F: X- Y linear and J( : X--> 
Z compact. If for all x E X and a suitable c > 0 1L'e have 
ff:rffx :S c(ffF:cffy + ffl\.rffz). 
(1.4) 
then dim kerF < oo and image (F) is closed. 
Proof (i) kcr F is finite dimensional if and only if the unit ball B = { x E kerF : 
fl:rlfx :S 1} is compact. Consider a sequence (.rk) in B. From (1.4) we conclude 
ff:r·"- x,ffx :S cffK(:r;;- .rl)liz. 
Because I\ is compact, i.e. (K:rk) contains a convergent subsequence, (xk) 
contains a convergent subsequence as well. Hence B is compact. 
(ii) \Yc write X = X' 83 kerF and from the Hahn-Banach theorem we 
conclude that X' is closed. \Ve choose a sequence (F.rk) which is convergent 
in Y. \Ye may assume xk E X'. If (xk) were unbounded, then by (1.4) the 
normalized sequence 11 ~: 11 would contain a subsequence (yk) with 
Yk --> y, 
IIYkil = 1 and 
Fy = 0. 
This is a contradiction to the closeduess of X'. If (J"k) is bounded we get a 
convergent subsequence by the same argument as in part (i), i.e. 
y = Fx 
for suitable x E X'-
Hence image (F) is closed in Y. 
D 
Proof of theorem 1.12. \Ve follow [91] almost literally. We have to show that 
F satisfies the inequality (1.4) of the lemma, where we set X = H1·2(R x 
R/Z;R2"). Y = L2 (R x R/Z;R2") and Z = L 2([-T,T] x R/Z;R2n) and 
choose a suitable operator 1\. 

12 
1 Introduction 
Suppose first that the function ~(s, t) is compactly supported: supp ~ C 
[-T, T] x R/Z forT> 0 large enough. By integration by parts we get

Since ll~llx ~ IIY'~IIt· + II~IIY, it follows that 
l:~llx ~ c1 (IIF~IIY + II~IIY ), 
( 1.5) 
where c1 = 1 +sup IS(s. t)l. So we have shown (1.4) for compactly supported~ 
since the Sobolcv embedding K : X '---+ Y is compact. 
Now assume that S(s, t) = S(t) and w(s, t) = w(t) arc independent of s. 
Consider the operator A: H 1•2(R/Z;R2n)-+ L 2(R/Z;R2") defined by 
d 
(A~)(t) = J dt~(t) + S(t)~(t). 
A is invertible if and only if 1 is not au eigenvalue of w(1). If this is the case 
there exists a constant co > 0 such that 
(sec e.g. [113]) and as A is self adjoint we have inequalities 
lwlll~lli'(R/Z;R""J ~ I(( iw~ + AOI ~ II~IIP(R/Z;R'"J lliw~ + A~ilu(R/Z;R 2 ")

This shows that F = ffs +A is invertible if S is independent of s and det ( W ( 1)-
I)=/= 0. i.e. if w(t) is an admissible path in Sp(n.R). 
Returning to the general case we see that the limit operators

(1.6) 
In order to prove (1.4) we glue together the estimates (1.5) and (1.6) by 
choosing a smooth cut-off function n = n( s) which is identically 1 in [-T + 
1, T- 1] and vanishes outside of [-T, T]. Writing ~ = a~+ ( 1- n )~ we compute

we conclude that the cokcrncl of F is finite dimensional as well, so that F is 
indeed Fredholm. 
D 
Once knowing that F is a Fredholm operator we can express its index in 
terms of the ~Iaslov index. Note that we have assumed that the limit paths 
w±(t) are admissible, so we can associate a 1\Iaslov index to them. We omit 
the proof of the following theorem which is prowd in [91]. 
Theorem 1.14 Under the conditions of the preceeding theorem the index of 
F = /. + J ft + S is given by 
'We "·ill now show, again omitting the proofs, how the l\Iaslov index can 
be defined for certain periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems. Let ( 1\f, w) be 
a compact symplectic manifold and H : R x J\!I ~ R a smooth time-dependent 
Hamiltonian. Assume further that His 1-periodic in time, i.e. H(t + 1,x) = 
H(t,x). Recall that H gives rise to a 1-periodic Hamiltonian vector field XH. 
\Ve arc interested in periodic solutions of the differential equation 
:i:(t) = XH(t,x(t)). 
(1.7) 

14 
1 Introduction 
The solutions of this equation give rise to a Hamiltonian flow c·1 E Diff(l\1), 
1,b1(x(O)) = x(t), which consists of symplectic maps (cf. Proposition 1.5). A 
1-pcriodic solution l'(t) = x(t + 1) is called non-degenerate if 
dP.t(I- d1,b1(x(O))) -=J 0. 
Now let x be a nondcgcncratc and contractible !-periodic solution of (1.7). 
Since x is contractible we can find a smooth function <p : D ---> 1\I. where D is 
the unit disk, such that 
<p(exp(2rrit)) = x(t). 
Choose a fixed almost complex structure J on !vi (sec Definition 2.5) and 
define by g( ·, ·) = w( ·, J ·) a Riemannian metric with the associated Levi-Civita 
connection \7. As is shown in [91, Lemma 5.1], for the disk :p : D---> AI there 
exists a trivialization 
D x R 2"------> <p*TM: (z,() t--t <I>(z)( 
such that J<P = if!Jo. <P*w = Wo and g(Cf!(, <Pe) = ((,e). Here Jo and Wo 
arc the standard complex and symplectic structures of R 2". respectively, and 
((,e) denotes the euclidean scalar product of R 2". All such triYializations arc 
homotopic. (If \l1 is another such trivialization, then z ,__., \ll(z)- 1<P(z) is a 
smooth map D ---> U(n), hence homotopic to the constant map z t--t 1.) This 
gives ris<' to a unitary trivialization of the pull-back x*T AI: 
<P.r(t) := <P(exp(2rrit)) : R 2"---> Tx(t)AI 
such that <Px(t + 1) = <Px(t). Now we assume that the first Chern class c1 (T M) 
vanishes over rr2(M). This means that for every smooth map u : S2 ---> Jo.f the 
C"-bundle u*T Jo.1 is trivial. Then the homotopy class of <Px is independent of 
the choice of the extension <p (sec [91, Lemma 5.2]). 
Define now the path rx in Sp(n, R) by 
lx(t) = <Px(t)- 1d1/'t(x(O)) <Px(O), 
0::::; t::::; 1. 
Because of the non-degeneracy of x the path '"Yx is admissible, so that we are 
able to assign a l'vlasloY index to x by setting: 
Let now x and y be two non-degenerate contractible 1-periodic solutions 
of (1.7) and u: R 2 ---> M a smooth function which satisfies u(s, t + 1) = u(s, t) 
and 
lim u(s, t) = x(t), 
s--oc 
lim u(s, t) = y(t). 
s---~o+oc 
Here the convergence is understood uniformly in t, ~~ has to converge to x and 
y, respectively, uniformly in t and ~~ ---> 0 as s tends to ±oc. 

1.4 The Maslov Index 
15 
Define the Hilbert space L2(u} as the completion of the space of compactly 
supported \·ector fields ~ on u*T AI which arc 1-periodic in t with respect to 
the norm 
11~11 2 =I: [ 1~(8, t)1 2 dtds. 
where of course 1~1 2 = g(~,~). The Sobolcv space Hl.2 (u) consists of tl1ose 
vector fields in L 2(u) whose derivatives Y's~, Y' 1 ~ arc in L2(u). We can define 
as a linear operator from H 1•2 (u) to L 2(u). This operator F(u) is the lineariza-
tion of the operator F: u >-> ~~ + J(u) ~~- '\'H(t.u). which will appear in 
section 5.3. The following result will be used in section 5.-l. For its proof sec [91, 
Theorem 5.3]. 
Theorem 1.15 The operator F(u) is Fr·edholm and its index can be expressed 
in terms of the Maslov indices of the boundary solutions x andy: 
indF(u) = tt(x)- p(y).

Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
of Symplectic Manifolds 
The main object of this chapter is first to show that locally all finitc-Jimensional 
symplectic manifolds look alike. On the other hand. a global examination of 
symplectic structures is usually made difficult by additional geometric proper-
tics of the manifold. Therefore we restrict our considerations and illustrating 
examples to the three most frequently encountered types of symplectic mani-
folds, namely cotangent bundles, Kahler manifolds and coadjoint orbits. 
2.1 
The Theorem of Darboux 
Remember from the first chapter that a smooth even-dimensional manifolJ 
"A12" is called symplectic, if and only if there exists a non-degenerate closed 2-
form won .U2". Our interest in the geometry induced on Af2 " by w is restricted 
in this section to local aspects. More precisely, we concentrate our attention on 
the most important local result, due to Darboux. which may be formulated in 
the following way: 
For any pointy on a symplectic manifold (.M 2", w) of dimension 2n there exists 
an open neighbourhood U ofy and a differentiable map f: (U,w)---> (R2",wo) 
such that r"-'·0 = wlu (where Wo denotes the standard symplectic stmcture on 
R2"J. 
In other words: locally, for an appropriate choice of so-called symplectic 
coordinates p and q, the symplectic form w can be written in the standard 
way: w = dp 1\ dq = I.:~=l dp; 1\ dq;. Obviously, this result allows us to extend 
to all symplectic manifolds any assertion of local character which holds for 
(R2",w0 ). Let us point out that the symplectic situation is totally different 
from the Riemannian case, where the curvature of the Riemannian metric does 
not allow such a result. 
The current proof of Darboux' theorem uses induction on the dimension 
and is accessible in different versions in the basic literature (see for example 
Sternberg [98], Arnold [7]). The proof presented in this lecture, however, is 
due to J. ~loser (consult Guillemin-Sternberg [51]) and is based on standard 
differential calculus. A useful formula for the proof is given in the following 
Lemma 2.1 Let V and W be differentiable manifolds and 'Pt : V ---> W a 
smooth one-parameter family ·of maps. By X1 we denote the tangent field along 
cp1, that is. Xt : V ---> TW with X 1(v) = ftcp 1(v). and we let llt be a smooth 
one-parameter family of forms on W. Then the follou·ing formula is tme 

18 
2 Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
Proof (by Moser, Guillemin-Stemberg). a) We first proof the Lemma in a 
special case: Let \l = ll' = M x I (1\1 an-dimensional manifold) and, instead 
of <p1 , take 1/;1 :AI xI--> AI xI, defined by 1/Jt(x, s) = (x. s + t). 
The most general differential form on 1\I x I, which depends on (x, s) E 
1\[ x I and a parameter t may be written as 
O"t = ds 1\ a(x, s, t)dxk + b(x, s, t)dxk+ 1 
(where the k-form a(.r. s, t)dxk is a sum of terms like a;,, ... ,ik (x, s. t)dx;, 1\ ... 1\ 
dx;k ; we will write a;(.r, s, t) instead of a; 1 , ... ,ik (x, s, t). The analogous notation 
is used for b(x, s, t)d.rk+ 1 ). Obviously 1/J~at = ds 1\ a(x. s + t, t)d.rk + b(x, s + 
t, t )dxk+ 1 and therefore

Remark: In the case that u 1 = u does not depend on t, the formula of the

We are now going on with the main result of this section: 
Theorem 2.2 (Darboux) Let w0 a.nd w 1 be two non-degenerate closed 2-
for·ms on a 2n-dimensional manifold JI.J s11ch that "-''olv = w1 jy for a certain 
fixed point y E Af. Then there exists a neighbo11rhood U of y and a diffeomor-
phism f: U-+ f(U) ~AI with f(y) = y and f*w 1 = -"'ll· 
Proof {by Moser. G11illemin-Stemberg). The idea of the proof is to obtain f 
as the time-1-map of a flow f 1 
(0 :'::: t :'::: 1) such that ft*w1 = w0 , where 
w 1 = (1 -
t)wo + twJ. The existence of the time-dependent vector field Vi 
belonging to the flow f 1 is proven step by step in the following way: 

20 
2 Darboux' Tlworem and Examples 
a) From w0 = ft'wr we get the necessary condition 
0 = ~(Jt'wt) = ft'(~wt + i(V'i)dwr + d(i(V'i)wt)). 
As dwr = 0, this is equivalent to 
d(i(V'i)wt) = - !!:.wt. 
dt 
b) We have to determine a 1-form n 1 := i(Vr)w1 such that dar= -fltw1• This 
is locally possible as the integrability condition is fulfilled: 
d 
d 
d(dtwt) = dt(dwr) = 0. 
c) Now the equation Clt = i(V'i)wr can be solved, because wr proves to be non-
degenerate and we get the vector field 1/i. Therefore we have established the 
existence of 1li and thus of ft. 
Let us turn our attention now to some details of the proof: 
b) vVe have to determine a 1-form Qr with dar= -f!twt. Let a:= Wo-w, = 
-ft((1- t)wo + twJ) = -fltwt. There cxists a ncip;hhourhood U, of y and 
a smooth retraction '-Pt of U, onto {y} (i.e. 'Pt : U1 _, U1 with r.p0 : U1 _, 
{y}, r.p1 = id and r.p1(y) = y (Vt E I:-= [0, 1])) such that in U1 
a- <p~a = [ 
(~r.p;a)dt = [ 
r.p;(i(Xr)da + d(i(Xr)a))dt 
(where X 1 is the vector field induced by 'Pt in the neighbourhood of y). Note 
that aiy = 0. We have -;0a = 0 and moreover da = 0; consequently 
a= [ 
r.p;(d(i(X1)a))dt = d 1' r.p;(i(Xt)a)dt. 
Hence Ci := J01 <p;(i(X1)a)dt is the searched for 1-form: 
dCl = d 1' r.p;(i(X1)a)dt =a= -~w1 • 
Note that a(y) = 0. 
c) In order to solve the equation Ci = i(V'i)w1 we have to check that w1 is non-
degenerate: Indeed nondegeneracy (I;Jt E I) is trivial in the point y, because 
Wt ly= wo IY -two IY +tw,ly= wo ly= w1ly 
and can of course be extended to a neighbourhood U0 <;;; U1 of y. Therefore the 
vector field 1li can be calculated for all t E I and x E U0 • By integration of 
1/i we get a one-parameter family of maps j 1, which has to be restricted to a 
smaller neighbourhood U <;;; Uo such that ft(U) <;;; Uo 
(I;Jt E I). 
Note the following properties of {ft}tEI: 

2.1 The Theorem of Darboux 
21 
• ft(y) = y: As n(y) = 0, we get from n = i(\~)'-<-'t and the nondegeneracy 
of w1 that vt(y) = 0. 
• /i '-'-"1 - ;.vo = 0: 
Thus / 1 proYides the desired flow and the theorem is proved: f := h is the 
diffeomorphism defined in the neighborhood U. 
D 
As a corollary we get the more current version of Darboux' result already 
formulated at the beginning of this section: 
Corollary 2.3 For any point y on a symplectic manifold ( A/2", w) there exists 
an open neighbourhood U ofy and a symplectomorphisrn f: (U,w)---> (f(U) <:;; 
R 2",w0 ) such that f*wo = w {where w0 is the standard symplectic structure on 
R2"). 
Proof. Use the exponential map of some Riemann metric on ( JU2", w) to define 
a local diffeomorphism 'Pl : ul ........ u of some neighbourhood ul of the origin 
in the tangent space TylYI2" ~ R2" onto some neighbourhood U of yin J\J2". 
In this way we get on U1 the symplectic form ..._·1 = .piw and with a linear 
transformation we attain without loss of generality that ;.;1lo= Wo Ia. Apply now 
Darboux· theorem to get a neighbourhood U0 <;;; U1 of 0 and a diffeomorphism 
'Po : Uo ........ .Po(Uo) <;;; U1 with 'Po(O) = 0 and 'Po'"'-'t = '-"'o. Therefore 'Po'Piw = wo. 
The symplcctomorphism of the corollary is now 
Remark: The coordinates in the corollary arc sometimes called symplectic, and 
an atlas of :\I is said to be symplectic, if the whole manifold is covered with 
neighbourhoods (and corresponding local coordinates) of the form mentioned 
in the corollary. 
\Vc will now leave local aspects of symplectic geometry and pass, in the 
last three sections of this chapter to some important examples of symplectic 
manifolds. Let us just remark that, unlike a Riemannian structure, a symplectic 

22 
2 Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
structure docs not always exist on a smooth manifold. Beside the restriction 
of even dimension. there is the limitation that any symplectic manifold has to 
be oricntablc. But C\'Cn an oricntable even-dimensional manifold possibly has 
no symplectic structure; S 2n (with n > 1) or any compact manifold .AI such 
that the cohomology H 2(.AI, R) = 0, for example, have no symplectic structure 
( cf. chapter 1). 
On the other hand, a smooth orientahle closed Riemann surface of genus 
g 2: 0 equipped with the standard two-dimensional Riemann volume form 
(which is a closed non degenerate exterior 2-form) provides the probably most 
simple example of a symplectic manifold (besides the Euclidean space (R 2", w0 ) 
with the standard symplectic form w0 , of course). 
Some other important sources of symplectic manifolds arc described in the 
following section. 
2.2 The Cotangent Bundle 
Starting with an n-dimensional smooth manifold !'vi, our aim is to describe a 
natural symplectic form on the cotangent bundle T* .AI. which is defined by 
T* M := { linear maps f ; Tq.AI-> R; q E M}. 
If q = ( q1 , .... q n) is a choice of local coordinates on U ~ M, then, 
for a fixed q E U, a 1-form 2:~= 1 Pi dq; on Tq .AI is determined by the co-
efficients PI, ... , Pn. Local coordinates of an clement l E T* AI arc therefore 
(p, q) = (PI, ... , Pn. q1 .... , qn) (describing the so-called Liouville form 1 = 
pdq = 2:~=! Pi dq;). 
First, one defines a distinguished 1-form iJ on T* M: Let X E 1J(T* M) be 
a vector tangent to the cotangent bundle at the point l = (p. q) E T* M. Under 
the derivative 7l' • 
; T(T* AI) -> T M of the natural projection, the tangent 
vector X E T1(T* M) is mapped to the tangent vector 1l'.X E TqAI. Define the 
1-form iJ on T* M by the relation iJ(X) = l(7r.X). 
The exterior derh·ative w := diJ turns out to be a symplectic form on T* .AI: 
indeed, it is closed and non-degenerate, as one easily checks using local coor-
dinates. (Write iJ = L~=l (r;dp; + s;dq;) and X= L~=l ((; 8~, + 17; a'~,) l(p,q); 
applying l = 2:~= 1 p;dq; = pdq on 1l'.X = 2:7= 1 1]; 8~, lq and comparing with 
iJ(X), one immediatly sees that ri = 0 and s; = p; ViE {1. .... n}; so iJ = pdq 
in local coordinates. Consequently w = diJ = dp 1\ dq and w is clearly non-
degenerate). The result is thus: 
The cotangent bundle T* M of an n-dimensional smooth manifold l'vf has a 
natural symplectic structure w, which, in the local coordinates (p, q) described 
above, takes the form;;,;= dp 1\ dq. 
Consequence: Every diffeomorphism f ; .AI -> !'vi has a natural extension to 
T*M, namely j := (f- 1)* = j*- 1. The definition of j: T*M-> T*M does 
not depend on a choice of coordinates and j is symplectic. i.e. j•w = w. {Of 

2.3 Kahler illaniiolds

course, if I= (p, q) E T* M, then ](l) is understood as the 1-form (f- 1 )* (pdq) 
on Tj(,1)M.) 
I'roof. It is enough to show that j*{) = {) (bec-ause ]•w = ]*d{) = d(j*{)) = 
d{) = w). \Ye have 1r o j = f o 1r, and so 1r. o J. =f. or. •. Then 
fJj(t)(].X) = j(l)(1r.(j.X)) = (f*- 11)(7r.(],X)) = 
(f*- 1l)(f.(7r,X)) = [f*(f*- 1/)](r..X) = l(1r,X) = Jt(X). 
0 
Note that not every noncompact symplectic manifold can be constructed 
as a cotangent bundle, because the symplectic form ..,. = dp 1\ dq is exact (i.e. 
of the form w = d{) for a certain 1-form fJ). 
2.3 
Kahler Manifolds 
As a part of the theory of Riemannian manifolds as \\·ell as a proper subject of 
great interest. Kiihler manifolds have been investigated extensively and many 
important results have been obtained (cf. WPil [10.5]. for instance). By defini-
tion, Kahler manifolds are symplectic and therefore provide a rich source of 
examples for symplectic manifolds. 
Definition 2.4 A complex structure on a 2n-dimensional r-eal vector space V 
is a real linear transformation J : V---> V with J2 = -I (where I: V---> l 7 is 
the identity transformation). 
Note that V, endowed with a complex structure. may be understood as 
an n-dimensional complex vector space: it suffices to define the scalar multipli-
cation by a complex number by means of (x + iy)t• := xv + yJv with x, y E R 
and v E V. 
Com·ersely, an n-dimensional complex vector space can be interpreted as 
a 2n-dimensional real vector space with a complex structure J: simply define 
Jv=iv (uEV). 
Remember that a n-dimensional complex manifold is a manifold modelled 
on en for which all coordinate transformations are biholomorphic. As a use-
ful example we mention that on every tangent space Tplvf of a n-dimensional 
complex manifold AI, a complex structure Jp is induced in a natural way: if 
Z = x+ iy: U---> en (with Z = (z1, ... ,zn) E en and X= (x1, ... ,Xn),y = 
(y1 , ..• , Yn) E Rn) are local coordinates in a neighbourhood U of the point 
p E AI, then the linear transformation JP : TpJI ___, Tplvf (brought about by 
the multiplication by i) is given by

2 Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
Moreover, the induced map J : p >--+ J, defined on the complex manifold satisfies 
the integrability condition 
h. 0 .J = .J 0 h. 
for every coordinate transformation h. An equivalent condition is that h is 
holomorphic. 
The just described complex structure .J on a complex manifold is a special 
case of the important notion of almost complex structure explained in the 
following 
Definition 2.5 An almost complex structure .J on a real differentiable man-
ifold JJl is a ex-tensor field of type (1, 1) (i.e. an element in r(T< 1•1l 1\l)) 
such that .lp, interpr-eted as a linear map : T,l\l -> Tpl\l, has the property 
1; = -I ('ip E M). Moreover, if the integrability condition is fulfilled, .J is 
called a complex structure on 1\f. 
A Theorem of Newland and Nirenberg states that an almost complex 
structure is a complex structure if and only if it has no torsion. i.e. N(X, Y) := 
[.I X, JY]- [X, Y]- .J[X, JY]- .J[.J X, Y] = 0 for vector fields X and Y ( cf. [62] 
vol 2, p. 124). Let us come back to our main purpose: 
Definition 2.6 A Kahler vector sprtce (V, w, .J) is a symplectic vector space 
(V, w) together with a complex structure J E Sp(V) such that w(v . .J u) > 0 Vv E 
V,v =f. 0. 
Note that some authors (like Guillemin-Sternberg [51]) do not require 
w(v, Jv) to be positive definite. 
Definition 2. 7 A complex manifold 1\J with symplectic structure w is called 
a Kahler manifold, if at every point p E M the vector space (TpM,wp, Jp) is 
Kiihlerian. (Jp as described above}. 
We should mention another often encountered equivalent definition of 
Kahler manifolds: 
Definition 2.8 Let M be a complex manifold provided with a Hermitian metric 
h. M is a K iihler manifold, if w( ·, ·) := h( J ·, ·) is a clost'-d differential form on 
1\l. 
Remarks: 1. A Hermitian metric h is a Riemannian metric such that for every 
point p E .M, hp is a .Jp-invariant inner product on the 2n-dimensional real 
vector space TpM: hp(Jpv, Jpw) = hp(v, w) 
(Vu, v E Tpl\l). It is worthwhile to 
note that hp is the real part of a Hermitian scalar product (in the usual sense) 
on then-dimensional complex vector space TpM, namely (-. ·)h := hp(-, ·) + 
ihp(.l·, ·). 

2.3 Kahler Manifolds 
25 
2. A Hermitian metric h, which satisfies the conditions of the definition 
(i.e. w(·. ·) := h(.l·, ·)closed) is called a Kahler metric. 
The equivalence of the two definitions of Kahler manifolds is a good occa-
sion to discuss some more details about Kahler structures: On a Kahler vector 
space (V ...... .J) a bilinear form b is induced by 
b(v,w) :=w(v,.ltc). 
It is easy to check the properties of b listed below 
• b is symmetric, i.e. b(v,w) = b(w,v) 
• b is positive definite, i.e. b(v, v) > 0 'Vv f. 0 in V 
• b is .!-invariant, i.e. b(.Jv, .lw) = b(v,w) 
• b is non-degenerate, i.e. b(v,w) = 0 'Vv E V => w = 0 
• and finally w(v,w) = b(.Jv,w). 
On the other hand, we can start with a complex structure J on V and a non-
singular. symmetric, positive definite and .J-inYariant bilinear form b. Then a 
symplectic form w is induced hy 
w(v,w) = b(Jv,u·) 
which makes (V, w, J) a Kahler vector space. 
What are the conclusions? Starting with a complex structure .! E Sp(V) 
on a vector space V, we can proceed in two different ways in order to have the 
same effect. namely: 
• either we endow (V, J) with a symplectic structure w, which turns 
(V . ..-· . .!) into a Kahler vector space, proYided that w(v, .Jv) > 0 'ifv f. 0 
in l" and w(Ju,.Jv) = w(u,v) 'Vu,v E V. As a consequence we get a 
Hermitian scalar product h by setting h( v. w) := w(v, Jw). 
• or we equip (V, .!) with a Hermitian scalar product h. The consequences: 
by definition h has all the properties needed to define a symplectic form 
w(t·. w) := h(Jv, w) on (V, J); so (V,w, J) is again a Kahler vector space. 
If we now transfer these concepts to the tangent spaces of a complex 
manifold. we get exactly the two equivalent definitions of a Kahler manifold, 
with the exception of one difficulty occurring in the second case: starting with 
a Hermitian metric on Jv[ it is clear that the resulting w is a non-degenerate 
differential form, which, however, is not necessarily closed. So the requirement 
of dw = 0 enters into the definition. 

26 
2 Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
In practice, using the second definition, the question of course is, whether 
w is closed or not. Let us cite a useful criterion due to :\Iumford [81] : G 
is supposed to be a group of diffeomorphisms of ]1.[ preserving the complex 
structure and the Hermitian metric h. P.Ioreover, let Gp denote the isotropy 
subgroup of p E AI, that is Gp := bEG: !(P) = p}. Note that pp(i) :=dip 
defines a representation pp : Gp--> Autc(TpM) of Gp. 
Criterion (Mumford) If Jp E Pp(Gp) for all p E 1\I, then d;.; = 0. 
Proof. By assumption G preserves J and h. Therefore, w and d;.; arc preserved 
too, that is to say 
dwp(pp(i)u, pp(i)v, Pp(i)w) = dwp(u, v, w) 
for any 1 E Gp and 11. v.w E TpM. Take pp(!) = Jp and apply this equation 
twice to get 
Therefore dw = 0. 
dwp(.Jpu, .lpv, .lpw) = dwp(J;u, J;v. J;w) 
dwp( -u, -v, -w) = -dwp(u, v, 11:) = 0. 
0 
This criterion will be used in &cction2.5, where we shall deal with the 
complex orojective space cpn as an example of a Kahler manifold. 
Another useful framework, giving an equivalent condition for dw = 0, is 
the notion of Riemannian connection. Given a Riemannian manifold (AI,g), 
let r(TM) denote the set of all smooth vector fields on M. A Riemannian 
connection is a map which assigns to each X E r(T AI) a linear mapping 
Vx : r(TAI)--. r(TM) satisfying the following conditions 
• \7 JX+gY = f'Vx + g\ly 
for j,g E Coc(A!) 
• Vx(JY) = f\lx(Y) + (Xf)Y 
for f E C 00(AI) 
• VxY-\lyX=[X,Y] 
• Zg(X,Y)=g(\'zX,Y)+g(X,\lzY). 
For each X E r(T AI) the map \7 x can be uniquely extended to tire 
algebra of all smooth tensor fields on JM as a derivation which commutes with 
contractions. If Tis a tensor field of type (r,s), then VxT is again a (r.s) 
tensor field given by 
(VxT)(XI .... ,X.) 
\7 x(T(XI, ... , X.)) 
8 
- LT(XI, ... ,VxX;, ... ,X.) 
i=l 
(see [62] or [53]). 

2.3 Kahler i~Janifolds 
27 
Criterion The condition dw = 0 is equivalent to 
\lxJ = 0 
for all X E f(TJI). 
where \1 denotes the Riemannian connection with respect to the Hermitian 
metric h. 
\Vc gi\·e some indications about the proof. Two important formulas arc 
necessary. namely: 
:3(L.:(X, Y, Z) 
V'zw(X, Y) 
\1 xw(Y, Z) + \lyw(Z.X) + \1 zw(X. Y) 
h( (\1 z J)X, Y). 
(2.5) 
(2.6) 
For the first one consult [62, vol. 1, p. 140]. It is a special case of the well 
known fact that dw is the alternation of \lw, if the torsion yv vanishes (i.e. 
Tv(X,Y) := \lxY- \lyX- [X,Y] = 0). For the sccoml formula verify the 
following equalities: 
V'z..:(X, Y) 
\1 z [w(X, Y)] - w(v z X, Y) - w(X, \1 z Y) 
\lz[h(JX, Y)]- h(J\lzX. Y)- h(JX. \lzY) 
(\lzh)(JX, Y) + h(\lzJX. Y)- h(JV'zX, Y) 
h(\lzJX- .1\lzX, Y) = h((\lzJ)X. Y) 
where v zh = 0 (equivalent to the last property of a Riemannian connection) 
has been used. Now, what about the equivalence d--.:= 0? \lxJ = 0? 
=?) 
\\'e state that 
2h((\lx.l)Y, Z) = 3dw(X, Y, Z)- 3dw(X, JY, .JZ). 
Then dv.· = 0 will immediatly imply \lx J = 0. Start with the simple relation 
h((\lxJ)Y, Z) 
h(V'x(JY), Z)- h(J(\lx Y). Z) 
h(\1 x(JY), Z) + h(vx Y, JZ). 
Now apply to the two terms on the right the formula 
2h(\lxY, Z) 
= 
X(h(Y, Z)) + Y(h(X. Z))- Z(h(X. Y)) 
+ h([X, Y], Z) + h([Z. X]. Y) + h(X, [Z. Y]) 
(which is easily verified using the last two properties of Riemannian connec-
tions). :\loreover, by means of formula (2.5) and Riemannian connection prop-
erties one computes: 
I 
3dv.·(X, Y, Z) 
= 
X(w(Y, Z)) + Y(w(Z. X))+ Z(w(X, Y)) 
- w([X, Y], Z)- w([Z. X]. Y)- w([Y, Z], X). 

28 
2 Darboux' Theorem and Example::; 
Inserting all this into the stated formula we get a difference amounting to 
h(N(Y Z), JX). But the torsion N of a complex structure J is zero by the 
theorem of Newland and Nirenberg. 
~) Conversely, we assume 'Vx J = 0. Then dw = 0 follows immediately by 
the formulas (2.5) and (2.6).

vVe close this section with an appendix describing 
Some results about submanifolds 
We intend to give a summary of some definitions and well-known facts, which 
arc used later, especially in Chapters 6 and 7. For details and proofs we rec-
ommend Lawson's book on minimal submanifolds [66]. 
By a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold Af we nwan an immersion 
1/J : N ....... 111 where ,y is some differentiable manifold. N usually carries the in-
duced Riemannian metric. With regard to minimal properties of submanifolds, 
we introduce the mean curvature vector field: Note first that for any p in a 
submanifold N of ,U we have an orthogonal splitting 
into the tangent space TpN and the normal space SpN of X at p. Any tangent 
vector X E Tpl\I may be written as X= (Xf + (X) 8 . 

2.3 Kiilllcr Manifolds 
31 
If V' denotes the Riemannian connection on J/. then the unique Rieman-
nian connection 'VN on N is defined in the following way: For tangent vector 
fields X, }"of N, both defined in a neighbourhood of a point pEN, let 
'V~Y := (V'x Y)7 
In an analogous manner one defines locally a normal vector field in a neigh-
bourhood of p, namely 
Bx,Y := (V'x Y) 5 
It is easy to sec that Bx,Y = By,x depends only on the vectors Xp and YP, 
not on the choice of local fields X, Y. As a ex-section of the bundle T* N ® 
T* N ® SiV, B is called the second fundamental form of the submanifold N. 
Bp is a symmetric bilinear map of TpN into Spi\". which enables us to define 
Kp := trace (Bp) 
for each p. K is a smooth field of normal vectors on ;\" and is called the mean 
curvature vector field. 
As a rough interpretation, the mean curvature vector field may be consid-
ered as the gradient of the area function on the space of immersions 1/J : N ---> AI. 
Indeed, more information on this fact would be given by an investigation of 
smooth variations of submanifolds. Nevertheless. we have the idea of a motiva-
tion for the following definition: An immersion 'lc' : ;\' -
J/ is called a minimal 
snbmanifold if K = 0. 
Definition 2.9 By a complex submanifold of a complex manifold AI we mean 
an immersion 1/J : (N, JN) ---> (M, J) of a complex manifold (N, JN) satisfying 
the condition 
for all p E :V. 
Proposition 2.10 Every complex snbmanifold of a Kiihler manifold is Kiih-
lerian in the induced metric and minimal. 
For the proof consult [66). Of course with this proposition it i~ easy to write 
down a great number of Kahler manifolds or, in other words, to give some more 
examples of symplectic manifolds. In addition, with regard to an important 
property of holomorphic curves used in Chapters 6 and 7 we formulate the 
following 
Proposition 2.11 (Wirtinger's Inequality) Let ( .U. w, J.1) be a K ii.hler man-
ifold with symplectic structure w and hermitian metric J.l, 1/J : N ---> Af any 2n-
dimensional real submanifold. At any point p E JV we denote the volume form of 
the induced metric on N by kw·Ji.)p. Then the pull back L'•wn ofwn = w/\ ... 1\w 
satisfies 
(1/J*wn)p 
.:...:__---,-!--'-"- :S (0'1/J•Ji.)P 
n. 
and equality holds if and only if TpN is a complex subspace of TpM. 

32 
2 Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
For the special case that N is compact (possibly with boundary) we 
get as an immediate consequence that every complex submanifold N with 
dimR N = 2n minimizes the volume (with respect to the induced metric) among 
all submanifolds of dimension 2n homologous to N in 1\I . :\ate that a sub-
manifold N' will haw volume equal to N if and only if 1/J' : N' -> AI is also a 
complex submanifold. 
Remark: In Chapters 6 and 7 we will sec that pseudoholomorphic curves arc 
area minimizing. 
2.4 
Coadjoint Orbits 
Our third class of symplectic manifolds arc coadjoint orbits. A good reference, 
especially for people interested also in physical aspects of coadjoint orbits, is 
the book of Guillcmin-Sternbcrg [51]. Again, the intention of this section can 
only be to give a short introduction into the constructions around coadjoint 
orbits and to present a central theorem due to Kostant-Souriau. In order to 
show the aim of our following investigation, we formulate here the result of 
Kostant-So~riau: 
Given a Lie group G with corresponding Lie algebra g. If H 1(g) = H 2 (g) = {0} 
(where Hk(g) denotes the k1h cohomology of g), then there is (up to coverings) a 
one-one relation between homogeneous symplectic manifolds for G (that means 
homogeneous manifolds of the form G/ H, which are symplectic) and G-orbits 
in the dual space g* of g. 
With this introducing statement, let us pass to some 
Definitions and Notions 
In this section, G always denotes a Lie group, and its Lie algebra is g := TeG. 
For any a E G the left multiplication la : G--> G is given by la(c) := ac. The 
right multiplication is ra : G--> G with ra(c) :=ca. 
A vector field X on G is called left-invariant, if la.X = X o la 
("\I' a E G) 
and the vector space of left invariant yector fields is isomorphic to g. Similarly, 
a differential form ..,. on G is called left invariant, if l~.w = w 
(Va E G) and 
the vector space of left invariant differential q-forms is isomorphic to 1\q(g*), 
the space of alternating q-forms on g. We may thus identify the space of left 
invariant q-forms with 1\ q (g*). The exterior derivative then induces a linear 
map 8 from N(g*) to N+I(g*). 
The Lie dcrh·atiw with respect to the vector field X with local flow 'Pt of 
a differential form ...: and a vector field Y, respectively, is defined by 
and 

2.4 Coadjoint Orbit&

and has the following properties: 
• Lx = i(X) o d +do i(X) where i denotes interior multiplication and d 
the exterior derivative. 
• Lx od= doLx 
• Lx("-·(YI, Y2)) = (Lxw)(YI, Y2) + w(LxYJ. Y2) + ..v(Y1,£xY2) 
• for f E cx(G) we have Lxf = X(j) 
• LxY = [X,Y] 
The k'h cohomology of g is defined by 
Hk(g) := zk(g)/Bk(g) 
where Bk(g) = 8((\k- 1(g*)) and zk(g) =kerb~ 1\k(g*). 
We come now to the definition of the coadjoint representation: Let A( a) 
be the inner automorphism given by A( a) := Ua-1 ora) : G--+ G. By setting 
Ada:= (A(a)).e : g--+ g, we introduce the usual adjoint representr,Ltion 
Ad: G --t Aut(g). 
In a similar way one gets the coadjoint -repr-esentation 
defined by A.df!w := Ua-1 o ra)*w = (r~ o !~_ 1 )w = 
r~.._. (the last equation holds 
because wE 1\ q(g*) is left-invariant). Our next purpose is to speak about 
Let (M. 0) be a symplectic manifold, on which we have a left action of the Lie 
group G, that is a differentiable map: G x M--+ j[_ From this we derive two 
different maps: 
'Pa : JI 
--+ 
M given by 'Pa(m) :=am (for any a E G) 
7J;m : G 
--+ 
JI.I given by 'lj;rn(a) :=am (for any mE M). 
If n is invariant with respect to 'P~' i.e. 
VaE G, 
then (a, m) >--+am is called a symplectic action. The following relations arc easy 
to verify: 

34 
2 Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
Theorem 2.12 (a) 
A symplectic action G x (M, !1) ---> (M. !1) defines a 
G-morphism \lt : M ~ Z 2 (g) given by 
\ll(m) := 1/J;,!1. 
That \lt is a G-morphism means that \lt(am) = Ad~\lt(m). 
(b) 
\lt(M) is a union of G-orbits in Z 2(g*). If the action is transitive, then 
the image of \lt consists of a single orbit. 
Proof. (a) 1/1;,!1 is left-invariant: 
\lt(am) = Ad~\lt(m) because 
(1/Jrn 0 h)*!1 = (<Pb 0 1/J,)*!1 
1/J;, o <P~n = 1/J~,!1. 
\ll(m) is closed, as d(\ll(m)) = d(1/J;,!1) = 1/J~"(d!1) = 0. 
(b) The orbit through the point IJ!(m) is given by 
f(m) = {\ll(am) = Ad'f:w(m); a E G}. 
We have \ll(liJ) = UmEAI f(m). Obviously a transitive action of G gives a single 
orbit and IJ!(l\1) = r(m). 
0 
A natural question in the situation at hand is, of course, the following: 
Given a C-orbit in Z2(g), say f(w) = 
{Ad~w;a E G}. docs there exist a 
symplectic manifold .1! and a map \lt : 1\l ---> Z 2(g) (as aboYe) such that 
f(w) = \lt(M)? 
An affirmative answer will be given in the course of the following construc-
tions. Before, howeYer. let UR remember some elementary 
Notions and Results from Lie Group Theory 
Definitions 
1. Let 111 be a n-dimensional manifold. A c-dimensional distribution tJ. 
{1 ::; c ::; n) on ~u is given by a map which attributes to each m E AI a 
c-dimensional subspace tJ.(m) of the tangent space Tmlll· 
2. tJ. is called a smooth distribution if for every m E 1\l there exists a 
neighbourhood U(m) and c= vector fields Z1, ... , Zc on U(m) such that 
for each point p in U(m) the vector·s Z!po ... , Zcp are a basis for tJ.(p).

3 . .6. is called involutive if it is smooth and if [X, Y] E .6. for all X, Y E .6.. 
(Z E .6. :¢'> Zrn E .6.(m) 
Vm EM). 
4. A submanifold (N, 1) of M is called an integral manifold of .6. on M if 
~.(Tq:Y) = .6.(z(q)) 
(Vq EN). 
Theorem 2.13 (Frobenius) Let .6. be a c-dimensional smooth distrib·ution 
on 1\1. 
1 . .6. is involutive if and only if every point of M lies in an integral manifold 
of .6.. 
2. Locally there exist coordinates x 1, ... , Xn such that an integral manifold 
is of the form {x; x; = consti fori= c + 1. .... n}. 
Theorem 2.14 Given a Lie group G with Lie algebra g and a subalgebra h C g. 
Then there exists (up to a Lie group isomorphism) exactly one connected Lie 
subgroup (H.t) of G such that z.(h) = h, where h is the Lie algebra of H. 
Coming back to our question we shall now. starting with a fixed orbit 
r(w), give the 
Construction of a Symplectic Manifold M, corresponding to f(w) 
The idea of the construction consists in realizing .\I as a homogeneous space 
of the form GIH, where His a closed Lie subgroup of G. The problem will 
be the determination of H in such a way that a symplectic form w on G I H 
exists, which. under the projection p : G --> G I H. is pulled back to p*w = w, 
the given form in Z 2 (g*). 
Given the closed 2-form wE Z 2(g) on G, we set h..,:= {X, E g; i(X)w = 0}. 
Note that if w is non-degenerate, then hw = {0}. 
Lemma 2.15 hw is a subalgebra. 
Proof. Let X. Y E hw. Since w is closed, we have 
Lyw = d(i(Y)w) + i(Y)dw = 0. 
Hence the computation 
0 = Cy(w(X, Z)) 
(Cyw)(X, Z) + w(CyX, Z) + w(X, CyZ) 
w([Y,X],Z) 
shows that [Y, X] E hw. 
D 

36 
2 Darboux' Theorem and Examples 
The next step is to define a distribution~: At the origin we set ~(e) := hw 
and for any other point m E Jl.f we define, using left translation. 
~(m) := lm.(hw)· 
The point is now that ~ iH involutivc. This statement follows immediately 
from the lemma: If X. Y arc two vector fields in ~. thc>n Xm = l,..Xe and 
Y.n = lm.Ye; SO 
[X.} ']lrn 
[lm.Xe, lrn• Ye] = lm• [Xe, }~] 
E 
lm.(hw) = ~(m). 
Using now the one-one relation between Lie subalgcbras and connected 
Lie subgroups described in Theorem 2.14 we get the existence of exactly one 
connected Lie subgroup (Hw,1.) of G such that l.(Te(Hw)) = h"'. At the same 
time, we know from Frobcnius' theorem 2.13 that through each point of AI 
there exists an integral manifold, as ~ is involutivc. \Vc know CYcn more: The 
integral manifold through the point a E G is ( atHw, ide). :'\IorcoYcr, tll(' right 
coscts atHw of 1H"' arc the leaves of a foliation of G. 
The verification is easy: (H..,, l) is the integral manifold through the origin 
e by construction: l.(Te(Hw)) = hw = ll.(e). But we also have Ta(mHw) = 
la.Te(lHw) = la.h"' = .,j.(a), and so (mHw, ide) is the integral manifold through 
the point a E G. For simplicity we write aHw instead of (wH"'.idc). Note that 
the coscts aHw arc, of course, connected, as Hw is connected. and that we have 
local coordinates XJ ..... Xn such that in an appropriate neighbourhood aHw is 
of the form {x; :r; = const; fori= 1, ... , k} (where k = n- dimh"'). 
We extend our results by the following important 
Theorem 2.16 If H,. is closed, then there exists exactly one symplectic form w 
on lYiw := G I Hw with..;= p*w, where p: G-> Afw is the canonical projection. 
Remarks: That H"'. to be closed is necessary to ensure that G I Hw is a dif-
ferentiable manifold. The fibres of the projection p arc just the leaves of the 
foliation and at the same time the integral manifolds. 
Proof (Sketch). (For details consult [51].) We begin with the local description 
of the integral manifold, following the theorem of Frobcnius: There exist local 
coordinates x 1 , ...• :r, such that the integral manifolds arc (in an appropriate 
neighbourhood) of the form 
{x; x; =canst; fori= 1, ... , k} 
(k = n- dimhw). 
For the tangent space we have the basis -a 
a , ... , _aa . and the symplectic 
Xk+l 
Xn 
form on G may be written as 
n 
w = L a;j(x)dx; 1\ dxj. 
i<j 

2.4 Coadjoint Orbits 
Step 1: ~ does not depend on Xk+!, ... , :rn. Indeed. a;j = 0 if i > k or j > k 
and a;J docs not depend on l'k+l, ... , x, for 1 ::; i < j ::; k, because 
dw = 0. Therefore we have 
k 
w = L aij(x1, ... , Xk)dx; /\ dJ.·j· 
i<j 
Step 2: As the integral manifolds correspond to the fibres of p: G--> ,\(,.we 
can usc x 1, •.. ,:rk as local coordinates for 1\I"'. p(.r 1 ••.. , x,) = (:r 1, ...• 
:r k). Define 
k 
w = L aij(:r1, ... , Xk)d.I:; /\ dJ.·j. 
i<j 
It is easy to check the following properties: p*w = v.J, w is closed and w is 
non-degenerate. 
Step 3: :;.: is well defined and uniquely determine\ on the whole manifold .fi.Iw. 
This follows from the fact, that p- 1 (m) is a leaf and therefore connected. 
So we sec that any two points in the same prei1~mgc p- 1(m) will give the 
same form Wm· 
0 
vVhat have we won in regard to our question? Is .\!.., really the manifold 
corresponding to the given orbit r(w) ? By setting m := Hw we have the 
relations 
p(a) = aHw =am= 1/Jm(a) 
(sop= 0rn)· 
As in Theorem 2.12 we define 
\fl(m) := '1/J~,w. 
Therefore \fl(m) = '1/J;,.w = p*w = w. Of course, \f1 is a G-morphism: IJ!(am) = 
Ad~\fl(m) = Ad~w, and so 
because G acts transitively on .fi.Iw. It is important to point out that the con-
struction only works if Hw is closed ! 
Let us turn now to the question of uniqueness. In other words: we ask 
whether there arc homogeneous 

38 
2 Darboux · Theorem and Examples 
Symplectic Manifolds with the same Orbit 
vVe start with the homogeneous manifold 1\f = G I H' where H is a closed Lie 
subgroup (which nm~· be non-connected') of the Lie group G. The Lie algebra 
of H is denoted by h. On the manifold 11! we give a symplectic form n and 
require a transitive ;;ymplectic action G x AI ~ JU with the induced map 
1/'bH : G ____. 1\f given by 1/JbH(a) = abH 
('lib E G). Theorem 2.12 provides the 
mapping \jJ : M ____. Z 2 (g), and we define w := \jJ(H) = t·'Hrl. Then \jJ(M) = 
{Ad;J'w; a E G} consists of only one orbit and we set f(w) := \jJ(,U). 
The question is 110\\" the following: If we go back from f(w•) tu ,\!"'.exactly 
as we have done above. do we get Afw = 11! ? Following the construction above 
let us go back step by step and first calculate 
h"' 
{X E g: i(X)w = 0} 
{X E g:1f.•;1rl(X. ·) = 0} 
{X E g:1/Ju.X = 0}. 
\Ve recognize that h =h..,, because 
Xf--+X+h 
and so V'H•X = 0 .;=:.X E h. Now Hw is the connected component of Hand so 
Afw = G I Hw is a cm-cring of 1\f = G I H. So the result is: 
Proposition 2.17 Homogeneous symplectic manifolds G I H arc. up to cover-
ings, parametrized by C-orbit' in Z 2 (g), provided that w produces a closed Hw 
in the above construction. 
The Theorem of Kostant-Souriau 
After all these preparations there is only a small step from the above result to 
the 
Theorem 2.18 (Kostant-Souriau) If H 1(g) = H 2 (g) = {0}, then there is, 
up to coverings, a one-one relation between homgen.eous SIJmple!'tic manifolds 
for G and G-o-r·bds in g*. 
Proof. Since H 2(g) = {0}, for every wE Z 2 (g) there exists a 3 in g* with d(J = 
w. Moreover, H 1(g) = {0} is equivalent to Z 1(g) = B 1(y) = o((\0 (g*)) = {0}. 
So if (3 1 , (32 E g* arc such that df31 = d(h, it follows immediately that IJ1 = !32-
So far we have proved that to any w E Z 2 (g) there exists oue and only one 
(3 E g• such that w = d3. 
We arc able to establish now a one-one correspondence between G-orbits 
in Z 2(g) and G-orbits in g*, that means between 
orbc(w) 
or be (;J) 
{Ad:w;a E G} 
{Ad:3;a E G}. 
and 

2.4 Coadjoint Orbits

Obviously the mapping Ad~ (j >-> Ad'!fw 
(Va E G) is bijective, because 
d(Ad'/!(3) = dr~/3 = r~w = Ad'f: v.:. 
As the last step, it is enough to prove nm\· the following statement: If we have 
the unique relation between wE Z 2(g) and 13 E g* such that w = d(3, then H., 
is the connected component of the (closed) isotropy group 
G1J :={a E G: Ad'/fB = 13} 
(and therefore Hw is closed itself). The confirmation of this statement is not 
too hard: The Lie subalgcbra corresponding to the isotropy group G:J is 
9fl ={X E g;l:.xf3 = 0}. 
AdtffJ = j3 <=} r·~j3 = j3 with a = exp(tX). Differentiation at time zero gives 
l:.x/3 = 0 (cf. [2] p. 268, for instance). If X E g then l:.x,L3 = i(X)d3 + 
d(i(X)S) = i(X)d(J = i(X)w (note that i(X):3 is locally constant, because 
(3 and X arc both left-invariant). So X E hw <=} l:.xJ = 0. Therefore hw = Yi!· 
Clearly H.., is the connected component of G;J and consequently closed. 
D 
Remark: There arc other criteria whether Hw is closed or not. We just mention 
a result of Chu: If G is simply connected. then Hw is closed. 
At the end of this chapter just one additional result, which provides a 
greater ability in practice to handle the symplectic form on a coadjoint orbit: 
Theorem 2.19 Given a Lie group G such that H 1(g) = H 2(g) = {0}. Let 
orbc(.B) denote the symplectic manifold and let w := d3. Then the symplectic 
form won orbc(.B) ~ G/Hw can be calculated by 
where Xs = p.X and Ya = p.Y with X, Y E g and p: G--> G/Hw. 
Proof. w is the symplectic form on G/H"' with p*w = v.:, uniquely determined 
by Theorem 2.16. \Vc have 
w(X13 , Y13 ) = w(p.X,p.Y) = p*G-,(X, Y) = w(X, Y).

An Example: CP" as a Symplectic Manifold 
One cla~sical example of a symplectic manifold is tlw complex projective space. 
vVc close this chapter with an illustration of two different ways of construction 
of a symplectic structure on CP": We first show that the complex projective 
space supports a Kiildcr structure. Later, we shall ~cc how a realization of CP"

Let us first define the Hermitian sc11lar product on CP". which of conrse is 
induced by the usual Hermitian inner product (-, ·) on C"+ 1 via the projection

where ~ 1 ,6 arc any wctors in T2 C"+ 1 satisfying"·~!·= 1/k E T,.. 1, 1CP". 
For better understanding we give ~omc details about r., and the tangent 
space T1r(z)CP" (with z E C"+ 1 ): Let ~V he the orthogonal complement to z 
in C"+ 1 (with respect ro the Hermitian scalar product (, ) ). Identifying C"+ 1 
with Tzcn+I, n· may lw con~idcrecl as a subspace of T2 C"+ 1 . Therefore an 
clement E, E T2 C"+ 1 has the form ~ = cz + rJ E Tzcn+l for a uuiquc c E C

· 
This motivates the definition of« ·, · ». Now h(-, ·) := Re « 
·, · » is a 
Hermitian metric in the sense of the definition in section 2.3. namely a J-
invariant Riemannian metric. 
With regard to l\Iumford's criterion presented in section 2.3. we arc inter-
ested in a group G of diffcomorphisms of cpn preserving the complex ~truc­
turc as well as the Hermitian metric h. Evidently, the classical diffeomorphism 
CP" ""' SU(n + 1)/U(n) in mind, we choose G to be the group SU(n + 1), 
which acts in the right ''"ay on CP", that is to say as a group of holomorphic 
diffcomorphisms presen-ing the metric h. The isotropy subgroup of ;r( z) E cpn 
is 
(SU(n + 1))rr(z) ""'U(vV). 
As above vV is the orthogonal complement of z in C"+l, whereas U(H') denotes 
the unitary group of\\". The representation Prr(z) used in l\Iumford"s criterion 
maps (SU(n + 1))rr(z) to U(W) and, as Jrr(z) on Trr(z)CP" is nothing else than 
multiplication by i on TT". the hypotheses of the criterion arc fulfilled. Therefore 
w(-, ·) := h(J·, ·) is closed. We conclude that (CP 11 , h) is a Kahler manifold. 

2.5 An Example: CP" as a Symplectic Manifold

\Vhat about the realization of CP" as a coadjoint orbit? The Lie group 
certainly is 
G := SU(n + 1) = {S E SL(n + 1. C): SST= E} 
with Lie algebra given by 
g := sn(n + 1) ={A E gl(n + 1, C): A= -AT and trace( A)= 0}. 
Introducing an appropriate real scalar product ( ·. ·) on g 
(A, B):= Re[trace(AlF)] 
we get a one-one correspondence between g and its dual space g*, given by the 
condition 
(with A. BEg and r:A E g*). 
From now on we identify A E su(n + 1) with c~ E g*. 
Consider the orbit orbc(B) := { Adff B: 
a E G} for a special 
BE su(n + 1), namely B := i · E_ with 
E ·= ( E,

orhc(B) = { a- 1 Ba; a E G} = {i · a- 1 E_ a: a E G} is an orbit in g*, and we 
claim that it represents CP". 
First recognize that a- 1 E_ a = E_ if and only if a is of the form 
( T

(detT)- 1 
with T E U(n). 
Therefore orbc(B) is isomorphic to SU(n + 1)/U(n) ~ CP" and we have rea-
lized CP" as an orbiting*. Using Theorem 2.19, a symplectic form on CP" 
is given by 
w(X,Y) := (-B,[k'.Ay]), 
where [·, ·] denotes the usual commutator and Ax, A. Y E g are any tangent 
vectors with p.Ax =X and p.AY = Y for the projection p: SU(n + 1) ....... 
SU(n + 1)/U(n).

Generating Functions 
If S is a real valued function defined on the manifold JV, then its difh~rential 
dS can be con~idercd as a mapping dS : N -----" T' :V from N into its cotangent 
space. The image Ls of this mapping is then an <'Xact Lagrangimc submanifold 
ofT*N: 
(dS)*(pdq) = dS 
and consequently ( dS)' ( dpl\dq) = 0. The function S is called a naive generating 
function for L s. 
Given a symplectic mapping 'P : R 2" --" R 2". :,.:;(.r. y) = (X. Y), its graph 
r, is a Lagrangian submanifokl of (R2" X R 211 , -_,;o Sw·o) . .\lake the symplectic 
variable transfonn h: R 4" ~ R4" 
:r+X y+Y

(q,Q,p,P) = (-2-, -2-.y-} ,),: - :z:). 
Then f", = h(f ,) can be considered a~ a Lagrangian submanifolcl of T*R2" ~ 
R 411 . (If :,.:; = id, then f", is the zero ~ection.) The question arises whether 
f", can be described by a generating function. If there exists a naive genera-
ting function S for f" ,. then the symplectic mapping ,; is determined by this 
function. 
In generaL naive generating function~ can only be constructed locally. If 
the notion of generating function is taken in the sense defined in section 3.:3. 
then it tttrns out that generating functions (quadratic at infinity) exist at least 
for symplectic mappings isotopic to the identit~· (oec section 3.4 for the precise 
s~at0mcnt and proof). In this way, symplectomorphisms arc replaced by func-
tions . .\Iorse theory then provides an efficient tool for analy:;ing the topology 
of the lew! sets of the generating functions. The critical points of the genera-
ting function for f, are in bijective correspondence with the fixed points of the 
symplcctomorphism 'P so that the topology also provides information about the 
fixed p~ints of cp (sec e.g. Hofer's theorem 3.1G). Furthermore certain im·ariants 
for the symplectomorphisms can be defined via the topology of the level sets 
of the generating function. Thc:;c invariants are due to Viterbo (section 3.7). 
They lead to a notion of capacity for subsets of R2" (sec section 3.8).

!v1inirnax Principle and Lusternik-Schnirelrnan 
Theory 
In this section we consider a smooth function f : ,\I --. R, where 1\I is a 
smooth compact manifold or, more generally, ,\I is a finite dimensional vec-
tor bundle over a compact base manifold B and f is quadratic at infinity, i.e. 
outside a compact subset of AI, the restriction off to each fibre is a non degen-
erate quadratic form. By Crit(J) we denote the closed (hence compact) set of 
critical points of f. Lusternik-Schnirelman theory provides a lower bound on

the number of critical points of f. It is an application of the minimax principle 
which itoelf has man~· ot lwr nsdnl 11pplications. Our exposition \\"ill follow qnite 
closely the elementary parts of [84]. 
Tlw minimax principle will be proved with the aid of n defornmtion the-
orem. For this we need some notation and a lemma. Let 
/" = { x EM: j(:1:) :S: c} 
denote the sublevel set ami '?t the flow generated by -\7 f. the gradient being 
taken with respect to <lilY fixed Riemannian mdric on 11£ \\·hich is constant on 
each fibre. 
Lemma 3.1 Let :ro E ;\[ /Jp a regular point off and set f(.r 0 ) =c. Then there 
c:J:·ists an E > 0 and a neighbom-!worl U of .1:0 such that cp 1 (U) C:: .!""-". 
Pr·oof. Observe 
At t = 0 the ineqnality is strict, hence f(cp!(:r0 )) < f(:r 0 ) =c. Thus for some 
E > 0 ami some neighbourhood U of .ro, f(cp 1 (1:)) < c- E for J: E U.

Theorem 3.2 (Deformation Theorem). Given c E R and a neighbourhood U 
of Crit(j) n f- 1 (c) in M' there exists E > () such that '?1 uc+c \ U) c:: r-E. In 
particular, if c is ll regular value off ther·e exists E > () so that Y1 (!"+") c:: r-E. 
Proof. Let !( ~ U be a compact set outside which f is quadratic. Since B is 
compact and the metric is constant oa the fibres, we can replace f{ by a larger 
compact set so that IIV fll is bounded away from zero ia J\I\1\. Therefore there 
exists E > ()such that '?1 (r+e: \ K) c:: r-s. Thus from now on we may assume 
"\! is compact. 
For each J: in the compact set X = f- 1(c) \ U choose a neighbourhood 
Vx of X in M aad a number Dx > () such that '?1 (Vx) c:: r-br. Set b = 
min (Dx 1 , •.. ,Ox"'), where (Vx 1 , ••• , V,."') is a finite cover of X. Then, <pr(V.r, U 
... u V,,) C:: r-o. Since M is compact and TV= U u Vr 1 u ... u V.r, is a 
neighbourhood of f- 1 (c), there exists E E (0, 6) such that f- 1 ([c-E, c+c]) C:: TV. 
Hence, cp 1 (f- 1 ([c- E, c + c]) \ U) C:: cp 1 (v:C 1 U ... U Vx,) C:: j"<. The result now 
follows from r+e: \ u c:: r-E u /- 1 ([c- E, c + c]) \ U.

\Ve can now formulate the rninim<Lx principle. For a family F of subsets 
of AI define the minimax off over F by 
minima.x(f,F) = inf sup{f(x): x E F}.

Equivalently, 
minimax(f,F) = inf { r E R: :JF E F with F ~ /" }. 
The family F i~ called ambient isotopy invariant if for every isotopy g1 of i\I

the identity). FE F implies g1(F) E F. 
Theorem 3.3 (Minimax principle) If the family F is ambient isotopy in-
variant. then minimax (f, F) is a criticalval·uc of f. 
Proof Suppose c = minimax (f, F) is a regular value. For c: as in the defor-
mation theorem there exists FE F so that F ~ j"+'. Since {'Pt}o<t<l is an 
isotopy of i\I, it follows that 'Pl (F) E F. Now. 'Pl (F) ~ 'PI(!'+") -t;::: j"-' 
implies minimax (f, F) :'S c- c:, a contradiction.

Examples and applications. (1) Let X be any space and let [X.l\I] denote 
the set of homotopy classes of maps X ......, M. For Ar E [X. Jo.I]. set F(!) = 
{g(X) : g E 1 }. Then minimax (f, F(r)) is a critical value of f. In particular 
(for X= Sk) this associates critical values off to each clement of 7rk{l\I). 
(2) L('t H~.; he the k-dimensional homology functor (with arbitrary coef-
ficients). Given/ E Hk(l\I) \ {0}, let F denote the set of subsets F C M such 
that 1 is in the image of (iF). : Hk(F)......, Hk(.\I). where iF : F '->AI is the 
inclusion map. This gives a critical value off for every nonvauishing homology 
class of ,1[. 
(3) A similar construction works for cohomology. For 1 E Hk(M), 1 =F 0, 
choose F as the family of subsets F of Jo.I such that A1 is not annihilated by the 
restriction map iF : H"(l\I) ......, Hk(F). Thus ,,.e get a critical value off for 
every nontrivial cohomology class of 1\l. 
Let us 1iow come to Lusternik-Schnirclman theory. 
Definition 3.4 Let 1\l be a topological space, A a subset of 1\l. The Lusternik-
Schnirelman category of A in M is defined by 
cat (A: J\I) 
min { k : A can be covered by k closed subsets of 1\l 
which are contractible to a point in 1\[ } 
and we write cat (M) for cat (M; l\!). Explicitly. U ~ M is contractible to a 
point in ,\/ if there is a homotopy g1 : U -+ ,\! such that g0 is the inclusion 
U '-> 1\l and 91 is a constant map. 
Some obvious properties of cat arc: 

46 
3 Generating Functions 
(a) 
cat(A; M) = 0 {=} A= 0. 
(b) 
cat(A; !II)= 1 {=} A is contractible in AI. 
(c) 
cat(A; AI)= cat(A; AI). 
(d) 
A<:;; B <:;;!II===> cat(A; AI) ::; cat(B; M) (monotonicity). 
(c) 
cat(A U B; .11) ::; cat( A; AI)+ cat(B; lll) (subadditivity). 
(f) 
If A is closed and defomwble through AI into B (i.e. the inclusion 
A'--> 1\l is homotopic to a map into B), then cat( A; M) ::; cat(B; AI). 
(g) 
cat(h(A); AI)= cat( A; AI) for every homeomorphism h: ,\!-> M. 
Proof of (f). Let ht: A--> AI he the homotopy. If B <:;; F1 U ... U Fm with each 
Fj closed and contractible in AI, then A= G1 U ... U G 111 , where GJ = hj 1(F1) 
is closed. Since h 1 I c) is a homotopy of the inclusion of Gj with a map into Fj, 
Gj is contractible in JI. 
D 
By property (g). 
Fm = { F <:;;AI: cat(F; lll) ~ m} 
is ambient isotopy invariant for 1 ::; m::; cat( AI). Hence we get a critical value 
Cm(j) 
minimax(f,:Fm) = 
inf 
sup{f(x): :rEA} 
cat(A;A/)2:m 
inf { c E R: 3 A <:;; fc with cat(A; AI) ~ m} 
inf {c E R: cat(Jc; M) ~ m}, 
where the last equality follows from mono tonicity. Clearly, Cm+J (f) 2: Cm (f). 
Here, equality can occur. For example, iff is constant, all c,(J) arc equal. If 
equality occurs, however, it is made up for by there being several critical points 
on that level. 
Theorem 3.5 (Lusternik-Schnirelman multiplicity theorem) If 
then f has at least k critical points on the level c. Hence for 1 ::; m::; cat(M), 
f has at least m critical points in fc'". In particular, f has at least cat (M) 
critical points. 
Proof. We may assume there are only finitely many critical points in f- 1(c), 
say x1, ... , Xr and we must show r ~ k. Choose open neighbourhoods v; of 
x; whose closures are disjoint and contractible. Then for U = V1 U ... U Vr,

cat(U; AI) ::; r. By the dC'formation theorem 3.2, fur ~ume c > 0, r+" \ U can 
be defonnC'd into r-'. Sine(' 
c- E: < Cj+l(J) = inf {n E R: cat(!": M) :::0: j + 1}. 
it follows from property (f) that cat (!c+< \ U; AI) ::; j. By monotonicity and 
subadditiYity. cat(!c+<; AI) ::; cat( uc+e: \ U) u u: M) ::; j + r' hence 
Cj+k(f) < c + E:::; inf {a E R: cat(f";AI) :::0: j + r + 1} = Cj+r+l(f). 
Thus. j + r + 1 > j + k, i.e. r :::0: k.

Instead of the Lusternik-Schnirehnan category. one often uses the cup-
length, which is easier to handle. 
Definition 3.6 The cup-length cl (1\I) of a space AI is the la1yest integer k 
such that there exists a ring R and cohomology classes a 1 .... , ak- 1 E H* (1\I:R) 
with positi1•e dimensions such that their cup p-roduct does not vanish. 
Proposition 3. 7 If 1\I is connected, then cat (AI) :::0: cl (AI). 
Proof. Set cat(;\!) =·nL Then, AI= u;'~ 1 M;, for some closC'd and contractible 
AI;. Let a I· ... , a, E H* ( M) be cohomology classes of positive dimension (for 
arbitrary coefficients). Since 1\J; is contractible, Hk(M;) = 0 fork i= 0. Hence, 
by the exactness axiom of cohomology (Hk(M,M;) _... Hk(M)-> Hk(M;) = 
0), a; liC's in the image of H* (M, M;). It follows (see [78. App. A, p. 265]) that 
a 1 U ... U a, lies in the image of H*(M,Uj~ 1 M;) = 0. Hence, cl (AI)::; m. 0 
Remark. The same can be proved for a cuplength defined with de Rham coho-
mology, where the cup product is induced by the wedge product of forms. 
Corollary 3.8 A smooth function f on a vector bundle M (possibly of rank 0) 
over a compact connected base manifold with f quadratic at oo (if rank M > 0) 
has at least cl ( M) critical points. 
Remark. The minimax principle and the lower bound cat (AI) for the number 
of critical points remain valid in infinite dimensions under the following con-
ditions: ;\I is a paracompact C 1 Banach manifold with a Finsler structure on 
T 111, f is bounded from below, fc is complete in the Finsler metric and sat-
isfies the Palais-Smale condition (see [84, Theorems 4.7 and 4.11]). However, 
in chapter 5 we will have to consider a variational problem with a function 
unbounded from above and below.

Lagrange submanifolds 
A submanifold L of a symplectic manifold (A/, w) is Lagrangian if at every point 
q E L the tangent space TqL is a Lagrangian subspaec of T,1.\I. \\"c recall that 
or equivalently, 2 dim L = dim A/ and wiTL = 0. An embedding (or an im-
mersion) f : N ....... JU is Lagrangian if 2 dim N = dim A/ and f*..; = 0. The 
embedded manifold is then a Lagrangian submanifold of JU. In case of an im-
mersion we say that f(N) is an immersed Lagrangian su./mwnifold. 
Symplectomorphisms f : ;\/1 
....... 
A£2 between symplectic manifok!H 
(Aft,wtl and (Ah,w2) give rise to Lagrangian subspaces in the product man-
ifold (Aft, wt) x (J\h, -w2), i.e. the symplectic manifold J\ft x Jh with sym-
plectic form w = njw1 + n:2 ( -w2), where ni : Aft x Af2 ....... 1\f; is the projection 
(i = 1,2). In fact, the graph rf = {(J:,f(J:)) E A/1 X Ah} of a diffeomorphism 
f : Mt ....... M2 is Lagrangian in (Aft,wtl x (Ah, -w2) if and only iff is a 
symplectomorphism. Just consider the embedding 
and verify that 
y: A/1 ....... Mt x J\h, g(:r) = (:r, f(:r)) 
g*w 
g*nt * Wt + g*n2 ( -w2) 
Wt- J*w2 = 0. 
The Lagrange intersection theory is motivated by the simple observation 
that the intersection points of the graph r I of a mapping f : M -. M with the 
diagonall::.. = rid arc the fixed points of f. For symplectomorphisms C 1-closc 
to the identity this leads to the following result [107, p. 29). 
Theorem 3.9 (Weinstein) Assume that (M,w) is a compact symplectic 
manifold with H 1(M,R) = 0. Then a symplectomorphisrn f: M ....... AI which 
is sufficiently C 1-close to the identity has at least two fixed points. 
The argument in [107] shortly reads as follows: There is a symplcctomor-
phism h defined in a neighbourhood U of l::.., mapping l::.. onto the zero section 
Ou in T* M. Iff is sufficiently C 1-close to the identity, then r I c U and the 
projection of h r I onto 011l is a diffeomorphism. Soh r I is the graph of a 1-form 
a on AI which is closed because h r I is Lagrangian. Since H 1 (M. R) = 0 there 
exists a function 5 on !vi with a = d5. The points x E A/ where 5 attains its 
extremal values will be fixed points for f, since 
d5(x) = a(x) = 0. 
An existence theorem of a type similar to Weinstein "s theorem will be 
proved in section 3.5 (Theorem of Hofer). It applies to symplectomorphisms 
which arise from Hamiltonian flows.

The reduction method of Amann and Zehnder [4] will reduce the infinite 
dimensional variational problem involving the action functional A to a finite 
dimensional one. In tht• present context, A can be replaced hy the generating 
function a(q(l), u) (sec below) which is defined on a finite dimensional vector 
hundk m·er R". 
The variational equation for A shows that 
VA (I')= -Fy- V H(-.. t) 
is the L 2-gradient of the action functional in direction of the fiber P,1(l). The

function 
a(q(l), u) = A('y(q(l), 11 + u•)) 
will have (q( 1 ), u) as a critical point if and only if, = -r( q(1 ), 11 + w( q( 1), u)) is 
a critical point for A. The formal calculation justifying this statement is given

The defining property for the mapping w asserts that the la.~t term in this sum 
vanishes. The variations for a and A then vanish simultaneously. 
In the remainder of this section, rigorous arguments will be given which

The integer N must uow be chosen such that C ·c(.V) < 1. The implicit function 
theorem (sec e.g. [G.5, p. 17]) then tells us that v = tc(q(l),u) defined hy the 
equation

G(q(l),u,v) = QJVH("!(q(l).u + v))

Nm\· G is in fact continuously differentiable and at the fixed point w = 
w(q(l). u) one has

Therefore DuG- I is invertible in a neighbourhood of (q(l), u, w(q(l), u)) and 
the assumptions for the implicit function theorem arc satisfied. This proves 
that u· is continuously differentiable.

and cont•ersely, if (q(l), u)) is critical for a, then 1 = "1 (q(l), u + w(q(l), u)) is

By saying that "' is critical for A we mean that

The function v = Q"t is thus given by w(q(l), n), n = P), and it follows that

Critical points for generating functions 
Given a real valued C2-function f on a compact manifold X. set 
Xb = {x EX: f(x) :S b}, 
bE R. 
Morse theory asserts that the topological type of Xb in dependence of b is 
unchanged outside of critical values of f. If n E H*(X), n i= 0 is a cohomology 
class of X and 
i>. : x>. '--t x 
the imbedding, then i~ n = 0 for sufficiently small A. The value 
c(n, f)= inf{>-: i~n i= 0} 
will then be critical for f (sec section 3.1). 
The same situation will now be considered for functions S defined on a 
vector bundle 1r : E ---> B over the compact manifold B. In the applications 
these arc the generating functions for some Lagrangian manifolds in T* B. 

3.5 Critical points for generating functions

Typically these function~ Swill be "quadratic at infinity". In the particular 
case where S is a finite dimensional reduction of the action functional A(lt), 
the quadratic term is due to the part 
j

0 pqdt 
inA. 
If q is a nondegcnerate quadratic function on E then the negative bundle 
E- ( q) of q is defined as follow~: In local coordinates, defined in a n0ighbourhood 
U, q can be represented in the form 
(x,~)EUxRn 
with the orthogonal decomposition~ = ~+Ell~-,~+ E R m, ~- E R k (usc a linear 
change of variables in each fiber). The dimension k of the "negative subspace" 
is constant, since q is nondcgcncratc. The system of coordinates {U x Rk} then 
defines the negative bundle E- (q) of q. 
Definition 3.13 A functionS E C 2(E, R) is called quadratic at infinity if it 
coincides outside a compact set in E with a nondegenerate quadratic function 
q whose negative bundle E- ( q) is trivial over B. 
'vVe will consider rcl<'ltivc homology and cohomology H. and H* with co-
efficients in some fixed field. For functions S quadratic at oo set 
E>. = {x E E: S(x)::; A} 
and denote by D(E-) and S(E-) the disk and sphere bundles associated to 
E- = E-(q). 
For sufficiently large A the homotopy types of (£A. £1') and ( £1', E->.) arc 
independent of A. This justifies the notations gx for £A and E-oo for E->. for 
large A. Observe then that by homotopy 
The Thom isomorphism H*(B) --+ H;(E-) is an isomorphism between 
the cohomology of B and compact cohomology (in the direction of the fibers) 
of the vector bundle E- over B, shifting the grading by k =rank E-. There 
exists a k-form ton E- (with compact support in direction of the fibers) such 
that the isomorphism can be described by 
et e-.; t 1\ rr* et 
et E H*(B). 
Compact cohomology on E- can be identified with relative cohomology on 
(D(E-). S(E-)). The cohomology H*(£00 , E-"") is therefore isomorphic (with 
a shift by kin the grading) to H•(B). The resulting isomorphism 
will still be referred to as the Thom isomorphism.

c(a, S) = inf{A: i~Tet fo 0}, 
where i>.. : E>.. ~ E is the inclusion. By Luste1'7!ik-Schnirelman theory (see 
section 3.1), c(a, S) is a critical value of S. We will thus refer to c(a, S) as the 
critical value of S determined by a. 
The product a 1\ (3 of a closed form ,6 with an exact form a = dr will give 
an exact form: d(! 1\ (3) = d"( 1\ (3 + 0 = et 1\ (3. This shows that the inequality 
in the following proposition is correct. Lusternik-Schnirelman theory provides 
a finer statement in case of equality. 
Proposition 3.15 ([103, Prop. 2.2]) If S is quadratic at oo and o:. (3 E H* (B), 
then 
c(a 1\ (3, S) 2: c(a, S)

Stabilization 
There arc two obvious ways of changing a generating function 5 (quadratic 
at infinity) such that the modified function dcscribC's the same Lagrangian 
manifold L C T* B. 
1. Stabilization. Let q : E' --> R be a nondcgcneratc quadratic form on 
the fibers of E' --> B. Then 
is called a stabilization of 5. The functions 5 : E __, R and 5 1 
E e 
E' --> R generate the same Lagrangian manifold. 
2. Equivalence. 
Two generating functions quadratic at infinity 5 1 : E 1 --> 
R and 52 : E2 __, R arc equivalent, if there exists a fibre preserving 
diffeomorphism <p : E1 --> E2 and a constant C such that 
Equivalent generating functions will generate the same Lagrangian mani-
fold. The following result is proved in [103. Prop. 1.5]. 
Theorem 3.17 Assume that 'Pt is a Hamiltonian isotopy ofT* B (B a compact 
manifold). If 51 and 52 are generating functions quadratic at infinity which 
are both generating for the embedded Lagrangian manifold 'Pl(On), then after 
stabilization 51 is equivalent to 52. 
The quantities c(a, 5) will change if the generating function 5 is replaced 
by 5 +canst. Therefore either a normali?.ation is required or the differences 
c(a, 5)- c(f3, 5) 
have to be considered. But if S1 and 52 are equivalent generating functions 
quadratic at infinity and if there is no additive constant: 
51= 52 o "'' 
then c(o. 51) = c(a, 52), since Et and Ei are diffeomorphic. In the case that 
52 is a stabilization of 5 1, it is still true that c(a, 51)= c(a, 52) (see [103]).

Symplectic diffeomorphisms of R 2" 
Consider the group H = H(R 2") of time-one mappings of Hamiltonian flows

R 2" x [0, 1] ---> R. For ~' E H its graph f 11, is a Lagrangian suhmanifold of

R 2" u { oo }, T* .0. embeds into T* 8 2" and h(f ,p) is compactificd by the addition 
of the point ( oo, 0) E T* 8 2". In this way one obtains a Lagrange submanifold 
f',1, c T* 8 2" with the additional property that 
f'~, nT*U = U 
in a neighbourhood u of co in S'2". The generating functions s : S' 2" X R" ---> R 
for f' ,p (quadratic at infinity) will then be normalized by the condition that 
the critical value associated with the point ( oo, 0) E 05 ,, n f' v is zero. The 
cohomology of 8 2" is generated by 1 E H 0 ( 8 2") and the orientation class 
{L E H 2"(8 2").

Symplectic Capacities 
The first symplectic invariant appeared in Gromov's famous paper [50]. He 
called it the symplectic radius and used it in the proof of the famous squeez-
ing theorem. \Vhcn similar invariants were discovered later by Ekcland, Hofer, 
Vitcrbo, Zehnder and others, it became clear that their existence has many 
useful consequences, e.g. on the rigidity of symplectic mappings. Therefore. the 
properties of these invariants were axiomatizcd and the notion of symplectic 
capacity was introduced. 
These invariants arc closely related to the existence of closed Hamiltonian 
trajectories on energy surfaces. That is why, in section ..1.1. we shall first derive 
the existence results we shall need for the actual construction of a capacity in 
section 4.2. These existence results arc of interest in their own right. The proof 
uses a variation principle to identify the closed trajectories with the critical 
points of some functional. The Palais-Smalc condition of this functional and 
Leray-Schaudcr degree theory arc then used to find a suitable critical point. 
After the definition of a symplectic capacity in section 4.2, we shall first 
derive the squeezing theorem and some rigidity results as consequences of the 
existence of a capacity. Then we shall constrnct the Hofer-Zehnder capacity [58], 
which is the one most directly related to Hamiltonian trajectories. For compar-
ision, the Ekcland-Hofcr capacity [24] will also he described briefly. 
4.1 
Existence of Periodic Solutions 
Let (R 2", cJ) be euclidean space with the standard symplectic structure. If 
S = H-1(0) is a regular hypcrsurface in R 2n, i.e. 'IJH # 0 on S, then the 
unparametrizcd orbits on S of the Hamiltonian vector field X = I'll H arc 
independent of the choice of H (only the length of the vector X depends on 
H, but not its direction). One can therefore ask which hypcrsurfaces carry 
a periodic orbit. A general result was given in 1978 by P. Rabinowitz [87] 
who proved that every star-like hypcrsurfacc carries a periodic orbit. Later, 
C. Viterbo [100] showed the same holds more generally for hypcrsurfaces of 
contact type (cf. below). In this section, following H. Hofer and E. Zehnder 
[57], we shall prove an even more general theorem which will imply Vitcrbo's 
result. 
Definition 4.1 A parametrized family of compact hypersurfaccs in R 2", mod-
elled on a compact hypersurface S is a diffeomorphism 0 : ( -1, 1) x S --> R 2n 
onto a bounded open neighbourhood of S, so that lb(O.x) = x for- x E 5. We 
abbreviate v( { E} x S) by SE. 
Example. Let S C R 2n be a smooth compact hypersurface. Choose a smooth 
function H on R 2n such that S = H-1(0) and '17 H(x) # 0 on S. Denote the 
(local) flow associated to c
1;~ 2 by r;/. If the constant cis small enough, one

can define a parametrized family of hypcrsurfaccs 1/J : ( -1, 1) x S -> R Zn by 
1•(t,a·) = <p1(x). By definition it satisfies H('lj;(t,x)) =ct. 
For a loop x with period T the action is defined by 
A(x)=~1T(-Jx,x)dt= r x*.\, 
2 u 
f[o,T] 
where >. = 2:: p;dq; is the canonical 1-form satisfying d.\= w. 
Theorem 4.2 (Hofer-Zehnder) Let S C R 2" be a smooth compact hyper-
surface and ·lj; an associated parametrized family of hypersUTjaces. Then there is 
a constant d = d(1/!) so that there exist arbitrarily small c for which Se carTies 
a periodic orbit x and 0 < A(x) <d. 
Before giving the proof, let us derive Vitcrho's result as a corollary. For 
further applications sec [57]. Recall that a hypersurface is of contact type if 
there exists a vector field X in a neighbourhood of S which is transverse to 
S and is homothctic, i.e. satisfies Cxw = w. For an equivalent definition sec 
section 8.2. Note that every starlike hypcrsurfacc in R 2" is of contact type. 
The hornothctic vector field is given by X(x) = ~x. 
Corollary 4.3 Every smooth compact hypersurface in (R2",w) which is of 
contact type has a periodic orbit. 
Proof. Let X be the vector field transverse to S with Cxw = w. The flow <p1 
generated by X allows to define a special parametrized family of hypersurfaccs 
modelled on S: 1/!(c,x) = <p'(x) for xES. Now, since ft(<p 1)*w = (<p1)* Cxw = 
(<p1)*w, we get 
(<p1)*w = e1w. 
It follows that y is a periodic orbit on S, if and only if x = <.p-" o y is a 
periodic orbit of S = Sa. (Note that y is a Hamiltonian orbit on S, if and only 
if w(y(t),v) = 0 Vv E Ty(t)Se: = ;p;Tx(t)S.) The claim now follows from the 
theorem. 
0 
Proof of Theorem 4.2. Let 1/J: (-1, 1) x S-> R 2" be the parametrized family 
of hypcrsurfaccs and let 8 E (0, 1) be arbitrary. We must show there exists E E 
( -8, 8) so that Se carries a periodic orbit. Since Sis cooriented, the complement 
of 1/J([-8, 8] x S) has two components, provided 8 is small enough. Let A be the 
unbounded and B the bounded component. \Vithout loss of generality we may 
assume 0 E BandS, C B for -1 < E < -8. We set U = 4•((-1, 1) x S) and 
"! = diam(U). 
Now Hofer and Zehnder construct a special Hamiltonian function H E

The map B : R x E --> E is smooth and compact. \Yith this notation and

x + Tt(x) = 0 
with 
Tt(x) = -(s + o- ll:r ·til) e + (e-t p- + P 0 ) B(t, x). 
We must show this equation has a solution for all t 2: 0. This will be clone by 
Leray-Schaudcr theory (see e.g. [19, chapter VII.B.3] or [92, chapter III]). 
Note that the map (t,x) ~ T1(x) is compact because the first summand 
is one-dimensional, B is compact and e-t p- + P0 is continuous. Let !1 be 
the interior of I: in E. By (4.4) there is no solution on an = DI:, hence by 
invariancc of degree under compact homotopies, 
deg (id + T1, !1, 0) = deg (id + T0 . fl. 0). 
Since B(O .. r) = 0, To(x) = -(s + o- llxll) e. Hence To : f2--> E is compactly 
homotopic to the constant map -oe. The homotopy is given by Ra(x- + x 0 + 
se) = -(s + n -lla(x- + x0 ) +sell) e. Since r > n, we have x + Ra(x) i- 0 for 
x E 80.a E [0.1]. Therefore, 
deg (id + Tt. !1, 0) = deg (id- ae, !1, 0) = 1 (ae E !1), 
which means there is a solution for all t 2: 0 as claimed.

that ( p- x;) and ( p+ x;) have convergent subsequences. The same holds for 
P0x; since E0 is one-dimensional. 
Assume now llx; II --> oo. vVe shall show this case cannot occur. First we

Remarks. 1. The same proof (replacing the interval ( -1, 1) by (Eo-15, Eo+o) 
for arbitrary Eo E ( -1,1)) shows that the set of E values for which S, contains 
a periodic orbit is dense in ( -1, 1).

4.2 
Symplectic Capacities 
A symplectic invariant for symplectic manifolds was first constructed by Gro-
mov [50] who called it the symplectic radius 
rad(M) =sup {r: :3 a symplectic embedding B(r)-> AI}, 
where B(r) is the euclidean ball with radius rand standard symplectic structure 
w0 . Similar invariants were constructed by Ekeland and Hofer [24, 25], Hofer 
and Zehnder [58], Vitcrbo and others [46, 103]. Such invariants arc now called 
symplectic capacities. As we shall sec, they arc closely related to the existence 
of closed Hamiltonian trajectories. 
In this section, after the general definition of capacities and some conse-
quences of their existence, a complete construction of the Hofer-Zehnder capac-
ity will be given. Finally, the Ekcland-Hofer capacity will be described briefly. 
Definition 4.12 A symplectic capacity of dimension 2n is a map c assigning 
to every symplectic 2n-manifold (M, w) (possibly with boundary) an element of 
[0, +ex:] and satisfying the following four axioms. 
Cl. Monotonicity. If 'P: (M,w) -> (M',w') is a symplectic embedding, then 
c(.U.w)::; c(M',w'). 

74 
4 Symplectic Capacities 
C2. Conformality. For every a E R \ {0}, c(AI,aw) = lalc(M.w). 
C3. Local nontriviality. For the open unit ball B C R 2", 
c(B,wo) > 0. 
C4. Nontriviality. For the open cylinder Z = {z E C": lzd < 1}, 
c(Z,wo) < 00. 
OftPn symplectic capacities arc defined only for snhscts of symplectic vec-
tor spaces, as e.g. the Ekeland-Hofcr capacity [24]. Of course, axiom Cl implies 
cis a symplectic invariant: if 'P: (AI, w) -+ (1U 1, w') is a symplectic diffeomor-
phism, then c(M.w) = c(M',w'). 
1'\ote that a capacity cannot assume the value zero. Indeed. by the Darboux 
Theorem 2.3 one can symplectically embed an c-hall (B(c:).'-"·o) into (M,w) for 
some c > 0. Axioms Cl to C3 then imply 
c(M,w) 2: c(B(c-),'-"'o) = c2c(B,wo) > 0. 
It can he shown that the square of Gromov's radius is a capacity. Only the 
verification of C4 is nontrivial. It follows from Gromov's squeezing theorem: if 
'P: B(r) ---> Z(r') is a symplectic embedding, then r' 2: r. In fact. the so-called 
Darboux width 
.;_ = r- rad2 
is the smallest capacity such that B and Z have capacity 71. Analogously, one 
can define the largest capacity such that B and Z have capacity 71: 
c(AI) = inf {7il·2 : 3 a symplectic embedding M-+ Z(r)}. 
The squeezing theorem is actually equivalent to the existence of a capacity 
satisfying c(B) = c(Z). Indeed, 
r 2c(B) = c(B(r))::; c(Z(r')) = 1-'2c(Z) = r'2c(B). 
(For another proof of the squeezing theorem using holomorphic curves, see 
section 6.3.6.) 
Before constructing a capacity explicitly, we give some more consequences 
of the existence of a capacity. An ellipsoid in R 2n is a set 
E = {x E R 2": q(x) < 1} 
for some positi\·e definite quadratic form q. By C3 and C-l, we have 0 < 
c(E, wo) < oo. 
The following lemma is an easy consequence of the a..xioms ( cf. [24, Theo-
rem 3]). 

4.2 Symplectic Capacitim; 
75 
Lemma 4.13 If a linear map cp : R 2" --> R 2" preserves the capacities of all 
ellipsoids. then 
Arguing as in [24, Theorems 5 and 6] one deduces the following C 0-rigidity 
result in (R2", w0 ). 
Theorem 4.14 Let c > 0 and let cp; : B(c) --> R 2" be a sequence of symplectic 
ernbeddmgs converging uniformly to a continuous map .p. If cp is differentiable 
at 0, then /(0) is symplectic. 
Using locally Darboux charts one concludes the following. 
Corollary 4.15 On a compact symplectic manifold (.1!. w) the set of symplec-
tic ex -diffcornorphisrns is C0 -closed in the set of ex -maps on ,u. 
A different proof of this result is outlined in [50]. 
\\'c shall now construct the Hofer-Zehnder capacity. Let (11!, w) be a sym-
plccti< manifold. Roughly, the capacity will measure how large a positive Hamil-
tonian H : 11! --> R can get when it is zero on an open set and docs not allow 
nonconstant pcriorlic solutions with period less than one. To make this precise, 
let H(M ..... :) denote the set of smooth functions H : .\/ --> [0, oc) satisfying the 
following two properties. 
Pl. For every HE H(A/,w) there is a compact subset K C .U \aM and a 
constant mH such that 
H(M \ K) = mH 
and 
0:::; H(:r) :::; rnH 
'I :r E !II. 
P2. For every H there is a subset U C 1\I \aM with nonempty interior such 
that Hlu = 0. 
A function HE H(Ji.I,w) is called admissible if all T-periodic solutions of 
the Hamiltonian equation -Jx = \7 H(x) on M with period T:::; 1 arc constant. 
Definition 4.16 The Hofer-Zehnder capacity is defined by 
CHz(M,w) = sup{mH: HE H(ll!,w), H admissible}. 
Theorem 4.17 cHz is a symplectic capacity and CHz(Z) = cHz(B) = 1r. 
Proof. \\'e have to verify Cl-C4. 
1. If.;: 1\I--> M' is a symplectic embedding and HE H(M) is admissible, 
then the function 
belongs to H(l\11) and is admissible.

2. We claim that H E H(M,w) is admissible if and only if Ha = iaiH 
is admissible in H(M, aw). Let X andY denote the Hamiltonian vector fields 
given by H on (M.:.)) and by Ha on (1\f,aw), respectively. Then. 
i(Y) aw = dHa = jaj dH = jaj i(X) w, 
hence Y = sign(a)X and the claim follows. Since Tnff,. = iaimfl. we conclude 
Cffz(lll.aw) = iaicHz(l\I,w). 
3. We show 
(4.6) 
For c: > 0 small choose a C""-function f: [0, 1] -> [0, rr) such that 0::::: f'(x) < 
rr, f equals 0 ncar 0 and 1r- c: ncar L Set H(x) = /(j:rj 2 ). Olwiously, H E 
H(B,w0 ). The estimate (4.6) will follow if we show H is admissible, since 
Tnff = 1r- E and c > 0 was arbitrary. 
On a solution of the Hamiltonian equation 
-Ji; = V' H(x) = 2/'(j:rj 2 ) x 
lxl and hence 8 := 2/'(lxl2 ) arc constant. By the choice of/, 0 :::; 8 < 2rr. If 
8 = 0 the solutions arc constant, while if 8 i= 0 they luwc period 2rr /8 > 1. 
Thus H is admissible. 
4. It remains to prove Cflz(Z,wo):::; rr. We shall show every HE H(Z,wo) 
with mH > rr has a nonconstant 1-periodic solution. 
Let K C Z be a compact set such that H(x) = mH for .r E Z \ K. We 
may assume H vanishes in a neighborhood of the origin. \Ve want to extend 
HIK to a fu'lction fi defined an R 2n. Choose c E (0, !l so that mH > 1r + c 
and pick a smooth function f : [0, oo) -> R satisfying

Clearly, {[ E coc(R2") and fi =HonK. The 1-periodic solutions of -Jx =

Pr-oof. \Ve have to show <I>(x) ::; 0 for every 1-pcriodic solution not contained in 
K. This is clear if x is constant, since fl :2: 0. If the solution x is not constant, 
it lies completely in the complement of K. It therefore satisfies -Jx = V H(1·), 
which splits into the independent equations

To finish the proof of Theorem 4.17, it only remains to show there is a 
1-periodic solution of -Jx = Vfl(x) with <I>(x) > 0. This is done exactly as in 
the proof of Theorem 4.2.

With the same methods one can show (sec [58, Proposition 4]). 
Proposition 4.19 AssumeS= ac is the smooth compact boundar-y of a con-
vex region in (R 2", wo). Then ther-e exists a periodic Hamiltonian tmjector-y x* 
on S such that 
CHz(C) = A(x*) = min{JA(x)J : x a periodic trajector-y on S}. 
Remember the action A is defined by 
1 t 
A(x) = 2 Jo (-Ji-.x)dt. 
The same representation formula holds for the Ekeland-Hofer capacity, so that 
the two capacities agree on convex regions with smooth compact boundary.

For the convenience of the reader we now ~hartly reproduce the definition 
of the Ekcland-Hofcr capacity [2-i]. For any 2n-dimcn~ional symplectic vector 
Hpace (V, w) there is a linear symplectic diffeomorphiHm 'ljJ : (V. ,,;) ---+ (R2", w0 ). 
Setting 
for any subset S of V, we can re~trict the discus~ion to the standard space 
(R 2", wo). For a bounded subset S C R 2" define :F( S) as the set of smooth 
Hamiltonians H : R 2" --> R such that

H=O 
H(J:) = ai.r21 
on R 2", 
in an open neighborhood of the closure of S 
for large 1~:1 and some a> 7!", a rf. ZiT. 
Further, we need the Hilbert Hpace E = E- 'T!E0 (f!E+ introduced in section4.1. 
Let r denote the group of homeomorphisms h : E--. E such that 
where 1± : E --> R arc continuous and map bounded ~cts to bounded sets, k : 
E --> E is continuous and maps bounded sets into compact sets. and moreover 
there i~ a p > 0 such that 
A(x):::; 0 or ll.rll ?_ p 
implies 
h(x) = x (i.e. k(:c) = 0. 'J±(x) = 0). 
Set s+ = {X E £+ : III" II = 1 }. The Ekeland-Hofer capacity of the bounded set

For an unbounded set S C R 2 " one define~ 
f'EH(S) =sup { CEH(T) : T C S bounded}. 
The Ekcland-Hofer capacity also satisfies CEH(B) = rEH(Z) = 7!". In [25]

Floer Homology 
In this chapter we sketch Flocr's proof of the Arnol"d conjecture [38, 39, 40. 41, 
42]. The conjecture is concerned with thP minimal muuhcr of fixed points of 
symplcctomorphisms on compact manifolds. Floer's construction is now known 
as Floer homology. There will not be enough space for all the details, never-
theless we hope to give a clear overview. In the proof that Floer homology 
reproduces singular homology we mainly follow Salamon and Zehnder [91]. 
Another good reference is the review article by :\IcDuff [71]. 
As a preparation, in the first section we shall present the classical l\Iorse 
homology using (nonclassical) methods that generalize to the Floer homology 
case [90]. In particular, it will be shown that :\Iorsc homology agrees with 
the singular homology of the underlying manifold and that this fact implies 
the classical :\Iorse inequalities. In the second section, the Arnol'd conjecture is 
discussed and the exact statement of Floer's results is giYen. The following four 
sections will be used to develop Flocr's homology theory. In the last section we 
shall briefly sketch the construction of a symplectic homology theory due to 
Flocr and Hofer [45]. 
5.1 
Morse Homology and the Conley Index 
In the infinite-dimensional case the classical methods of Morse theory (sec 
e.g. [77, 1-t 54]) can only be used if the Morse function has a well-behaved 
gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric and all the critical points have 
finite index. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the action functional (on 
the infinite dimensional loop space) we will have to consider in section 5.3. 
However. there is another approach to Morse theory (on finite-dimensional 
manifolrls) which docs generalize to the infinite dimensional situation. This is 
what we arc going to explain in this section. First we \\'ill review some results 
on gradient dynamical systems, in particular the Conley index. Then we will 
define the :\Iorsc complex (or Morsc-Smale-\Vitten complex) and show that 
its homology, called Morse homology, agrees with the usual singular homology 
of the underlying manifold. Finally we will see how this implies the (classical) 
Morse inequalities. Another, very detailed reference for :\Iorse homology is [93]. 
Let JIbe a compact n-dimcnsional smooth manifold (without boundary) 
and I : JI --> R a smooth function. A critical point p of I is called nonde-
generate if for some (hence for any) local coordinate system at p the matrix 
((82 I ;a~·;Eh·j)(p)) is nonsingular. This matrix is called the Hessian off at p. 
The number of its negative eigenvalues is independent of the choice of local 
coordinates and is called the (Morse) index ind(p) of I at p. A Morse func-
tion is a smooth function such that all its critical points are nondegenerate. 
Assume now we have a Morse function I on our compact manifold A1. Choose 
a Riemannian metric g on A.f and consider the negative gradient flow <.p1 of

f (associated to the vector field -vgfl· The critical points off arc then hy-
perbolic fixed points of <p1 • The following lemma yields local coordinates ncar 
critical points which determine the local picture of the flow. 
Lemma 5.1 (Morse) If p is a nondegenerate critical point of f of index k, 
then there is a coordinate map h : U -> R n on a neighborhood U of p such 
that 
k

i=k+l 
For a proof sec e.g. [77, p. 6] or [54, 6.1.1]. Using these local coordinates 
and the flow, it is clear that the sets 
W 8 (p) = {x E ]\[: lim <p1(.T) = p}, 
Wu(p) = {x E ]\[: lim /(x) = p} 
t-x 
t--x 
arc submanifolds of !II of dimension n- iml(p) and ind(p), respectively, diffeo-
morphic to open euclidean balls of the respective dimension. 
~ow we define the Conley index (or homotopy index) of an isolated in-
variant set. A subset S of Jl.f is invariant if <p1 (S) = S for every t E R. It is 
isolated if there exists an 'isolating neighborhood' N of S such that 
s = n 
<pt(N) 
tER 
i.e. S agrees with the maximal invariant set inN. An index pair for an isolated 
invariant set Sis a pair (N, L) of compact sets L C N ~ JI.I such that S lies in 
the interior of N \ L, cl(N \ L) is an isolating neighborhood for S. and 
(1) x E L, <p[O,tl(x) C N =? <pt(x) E L, 
(2) xEN\L=:>-3t>O:<piO,tl(x) eN. 
Condition (1) says that L is forward invariant in N and (2) means that the 
orbits can leaveN only through L, which is therefore called an exit set for N. In 
[20, 88] it is shown that every isolated invariant set has an index pair such that 
the topological quotient NIL has the homotopy type of a finite polyhedron. 
Moreover, the homotopy type is independent of the choice of the index pair. 
Lemma 5.2 (Conley) If (N, L) and (N', L') are two index pairs for S, then 
the index spaces NIL and N' I L' are homotopy equivalent. 
For a proof, see [20] or [90]. The Conley index of S is by definition the 
homotopy type of the pointed space NIL. If L is a neighborhood deformation 
retract in N, then the homology of NIL agrees with H. ( N, L). Hence the latter 
is independent of the choice of index pair. 

5.1 Morse Homology and the Conley Index 
81 
vVe give two important examples of index pair~ 
Example 1. If p is a nondegenerate critical point of index k, then an index 
pair for the isolated invariant set {p} can be givm by 
where h i~ a -:\Iorsc chart ncar p and Dk is the closed unit ball in R k. The 
Conley index of {p} is the homotopy type of a pointed k-sphere and in this 
sense, the Conley index generalizes the Morse index iud(p) = k. Note also that 
H.(N,L) = H.(Dk,8Dk). 
Example 2. If Sis the set of critical points off on the (critical) level c, then 
an index pair is given by N = Mb, L = M", where M" = {x EM: f(x)::; a} 
and a, b arc regular values of f such that c is the only critical value in the 
interval (a, b). 
If the metric g is generic, i.e. belongs to a certain dense set of mctrics, 
then the flow is of Marse-Smale type: for every pair (:r. y) of critical points the 
unstable submanifold W"(x) intersects the stable submanifolcl vVS(y) trans-
versely, see [96]. We can identify the space of trajectories of the gradient flow 
connecting x to y 
M(x,y)={"!:R-->M:"f=-\19 fo"f, 
lim "((t)=x, lim"((t)=y} 
t--x 
t----+x 
with the intersection 
M(x,y) = Wu(x) n w•(y). 
Observe that by the Morse lemma, dim W"(x) = ind(.r) and codim W"(y) = 
ind(y). Since for transversal intersections codimensions add, we get 
dimM(x, y) = ind(x)- ind(y) 
provided i\I(x,y) is not empty. Because every trajectory 'Y: R--> M has a 
one-dimensional family of reparametrizations 'Yr(t) = 'Y(t + T), T E R, the 
manifold of unparametrized trajectories from x toy, ,\J(x,y) = M(x,y)jR, 
has dimension 
dimNI(x, y) = ind(x)- ind(y)- 1. 
In particular, connecting orbits from x to y exist only if ind(x) > ind(y). vVe 
can identify ii(x,y) with M(x,y) n {z EM: f(z) =a} for some a between 
f(y) and f(.r). It follows that M(x, y) is compact. Indeed, if 'Yi(t) is a sequence 
of orbits connecting x to y, then a subsequence converges (in an appropriate 
sense) to a finite family of orbits 'Yi connecting xi-! to xi for i = 1, ... , m, 
where x0 = x, xm = y and ind(x') < ind(xi- 1). 
Let us now define the Morse complex for coefficients in Z. (Note that for 
coefficients in Z2 = Z/2Z the following discussion simplifies significantly be-
cause signs do not matter, so that one does not have to consider orientations.) 

82 
5 Floor Homology 
For every critical point x of f we choose an orientation of the vector space 
E"(x) = 1:XW"(:r) and denote by (x) the pair consisting of x and this orien-
tation. For k = 0, 1, ... , n = dim AI let Ck be the free group generated by the 
set of critical points of index k: 
ck = 
EB 
Z(x) 
x: ind(x)=k 
Since f is of MorsP-Smale type, if ind(.r) = ind(y) + 1, then AI(:r. y) consists of 
finitely many connecting orbits, since it b zero-dimensional and compact. To 
every connecting orbit '"Y from x to y we can assign a sign n.., = ±1 as follows. 
The orthogonal complement of v = lim 1 ~-oc -'y(t)/b(t)l in E"(.r) inherits an 
orientation from (x). The tangent flow induces an isomorphism from this or-
thogonal complement onto E" (y) and we define n-, to be + 1 or -1 according 
to whether this map is orientation preserving or not. Set 
n(x,y) = I:n.., 
""r 
where the sum runs over all orhitH connecting x to y. Tlw boundary operator 
Dk : Ck+l --> Ck of the Morse complex is defined by 
D(x) = L n(x, y)(y) 
(5.1) 
y 
where the s•tm runs over all critical points of index k. The significance of this 
construction rests on the following theorem, which is due toR. Thom, S. Smale, 
C. Conley, E. Witten. 
Theorem 5.3 ( ck. 8) is a chain complex: Dk-! 0 fjk = 0 and its homology 
reproduces the singular homology of M: ker Dk-J/imtJk ~ Hk(M: Z). 
Remark. Using the universal coefficient theorem, the Morse complex can be 
defined over any abelian group, and Theorem 5.3 remains valid if Z is replaced 
by any principal ideal domain (see e.g. [41] or [90]). 
For the proof of Theorem 5.3 we will follow Salamon in [90]. First we have 
to describe Conley's connection matrix for the special case of a l.Iorse-Smale 
gradient flow. For every critical point x off let (Nx, Lx) be an index pair as 
in Example 1 above. Since an orientation of E"(x) determines a generator of 
Hk(Nx, Lx) ~ Hk(Dk, 8Dk) ~ Z if k = ind(x), the group Ck can be identified 
with 
ck = 
EB 
Hk(Nx, Lx) 
x:ind(x)=k 

5.1 1\Iorse Homology and the Conlr~y Index 
If ind(:r) = ind(y) + 1, then 
S(x,y) = lll(:r,y) U {:r.y} 
is an isolated invariant set. Let (N2, N0 ) be an index pair for S(x. y) and set 
N1 =No U (:\'2 n {! s; a}), where f(y) < a < j(:r). Then (N2, N!) is an index 
pair for {.r} and (N1,No) is an index pair for {y}. Define the homomorphism 
to he the composition 
where the isomorphisms arc induced by the homotopy equivalence of Lem-
ma 5.2. This determines a homomorphism ~k : Ck+l _, Ck which is a special 
case of Conley's connection matrix and agrees with the boundary operator 
(5.1). 
Lemma 5.4 a = ~. 
Proof. \Ve restrict to the case where x and y arc the only critical points of f 
in f- 1([a.b]). where n = f(y) and b = f(x). The general case can he reduced 
to this one by changing f outside an isolating neighborhood of S(x,y), sec [90. 
p. 119] and [88]. For c E (a, b), c: > 0 small and T > 0 large, define the index 
pairs 
Nx 
{zEM:f(rp-T(z))s;b+c.f(::)2:c}. 
Lx 
{zENx:f(z)=c}, 
Ny 
{z E 11!: f(rpT z) 2: a- c:, f(z) s; c}, 
Ly 
{zENy:j(rpTz)=a-c-} 
(The reader should make a picture of these sets. e.g. for n = 3, ind(y) = 1.) 
An index triple for the repcllcr-attractor pair (x, y) in the isolated invariant set 
S(x,y) is then given by 
X2 = Nx U Ny, 
N1 =NyU Lx, 
No= Ly U cl (Lx \ Ny) 
Note that letting T--> oo, Nx contracts onto wu(x) n{f 2: c} and Ny contracts 
onto vVS(y)n{f s; c}. Since Tt'U(x) and W 8(y) intersect transversely, it follows 
that N y n H"" ( x) n {j = c} consists of finitely many components V1, ... , V.n, 
one for c\·ery orbit connecting x to y, and each Vj contains a unique point 
Zj E lll(.r. y) n Vj. J\Iore precisely, there exists a diffeomorphism 
k = ind (y) =dim wu(y) 
such that v(Ly) = 8Dk X vn-k, 1j;(W 8 (y) n Ny) = {0} X vn-k and 1/'(Vj) = 
Dk x { (Ji} for some (Ji E avn-k. Hence the map 1.!•1 = rr1 o 1/J : Ny --> Dk and 
the diffeomorphism 1/111 Vj : Vj -> Dk induce isomorphisms in homology 
Hk(Ny,Ly)::::: Hk(Dk,8Dk)::::: Hk(Vj.IV1) 

84 
5 Floer Homology 
where Wi = VjnLy is the boundary of Vj. The orientation of E"(y) given by (y) 
determines a generator a of Hk(Ny. Ly) ~ Z. Under the above isomorphism it is 
mapped to a generator ai of Hk(Vj, Wi ). The homology class a J is determined 
by the orientation Tz1 Vj inherits from E"(y) via the isomorphism Tz1 Vj ~ 
E"(y) induced by the flow. This orientation agrees with the one inherited from 
H'"(x) via the injection 
(choosing - '17 f (:: J) as the first basis vector) if and only if n J = 1, where n J E 
{1, -1} is the sign associated to the connecting orbit /'j(t) = /(zj)· 
Now choose a triangulation of the k-manifolds Vj and extend it to one of 
the k +!-manifold H'"(x) n {! ~ c} with boundary W"(x) n {! = c}. Together 
with the orientation of W"(x) given by (x) this determines a generator 
(3 E Hk+1(W"(x) n N.n W"(x) n Lx) ~ Hk+l(Nx.L.r) 
The homology class 8J(3 E Hk(TP(x) n Lx, cl(W"(x) n Lx \ Vj )) ~ Hk(Vj, llj) 
is represented by the original trangulation of Vj together with the orientation 
inherited from lr''(.r) and therefore agrees with njO:j. Using the above isomor-
phisms Hk(Ny, Ly) ~ Hk(Vj, Wj), we obtain 
!::..k(x, y) (3 = 2::.> J a= n(x, y) a E Hk(Ny. Ly) 
j=l 
Identifying (3 with (x) and a with (y) (as in the definition of t::..k) and summing 
over ally E Ck connected to x, yields !::..k(x) = L n(x, y) (y) = B(x). 
D 
Proof of Theorem 5.3. For j ::; k let Skj be the union of the sets M(x,y) 
over all pairs (x. y) of critical points of f with j ::; ind(y) ::; ind(x) ::; k. 
These sets are compact if the gradient flow of f is Morse-Smale (by the same 
argument as used before to show that JV!(x, y) is compact). It follows that 
Ski is an isolated invariant set for j ::; k. In particular, Sno = !vi and Skk 
consists of the critical points of index k. By [20] there exists an index filtration 
No C N1 C ... C Nn = M such that (Nk, Nj-1) is an index pair for Skj where 
j ::; k and N-1 = 0.

\Vc can now get the Morse inequalities as a corollary of Theorem 5.3. 
Corollary 5.5 Let f be a Mor-se function on the compact n-rnanifold 1\I. If 
ck denotes the number of critical points of index k and ,6k denotes the Betti 
number rankHk(AJ;R) for coefficients in a p·rincipal ideal domain R, then 
Ck- Ck-1 + ... ±co 2: ,6k- Pk-1 + ... ± f3o 
for k 2: 0. and equality holds for- k 2: n. 
In particular, q 2:: .6k (V k), hence the number of critical points off is at 
least the sum of the Betti numbers of 11!. 
Proof. Let ( Ck(R), Dk(R)) be the 1\Iorse complex with coefficients in R. Note 
that ck =dim Ck(R) and set dk =rank Dk(R) =dim im Dk(R). Since 
we have <h·-1 = q- dimkerok-J(R).

The Arnol'd Conjecture 
Without further notice we always assume that (AI, w) is a compact smooth 
symplectic manifold without boundary. vVc arc interested in the dynamics as-
sociated to a time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field Xt: 
w(X~o .) = dH~, HE C'x(R x AI, R). 
The timc-1 map <p = 'P1 of such a vector field is called an exact (symplectic) 
diffeomorphism or a Hamiltonian map. In [8] it is shown that the set of Hamil-
tonian maps is the commutator subgroup of the group of symplectomorphisms, 
and a proper subgroup if H 1(M,R) =I 0. Considered as dynamical systems, 
exact diffcomorphisms should have interesting special properties. Concerning 
the simplest object of dynamical thC'ory, the fixed point set, V. I. Arnol'd con-
jectured that the Lefschetz fixed point theory (which applies to general diffeo-
morphisms) should be replaced here by a Morse-type theory. This is obviously 
the case if H is time independent, since then every critical point of H is a fixed 
point of the flow (i.e. of 'Pt for all t). Moreover, it was proven in [6] and [108] 
that every exact diffeomorphism which is C 1-close to the identity has at least 
as many fixed points as a smooth function on l'vi has critical points. The ques-
tion was raised in [7] whether this holds for general exact diffeomorphisms and 
this has become known as the Arnol'd conjecture. In 1982, Conley and Zehn-
der [21] proved the conjecture for the torus T 2n with the standard symplectic 
structure. They used a variational principle similar to the one described in the 
next section and then could reduce the problem to finite dimension. 
Floer's famous contribution to the problem gave rise to what is now called 
Floer homology. Actually, Floer's method did not yield a proof of the Arnol'd 
conjecture in exactly the (general) form stated above. To describe what has 
been proved we need to make some definitions. 
Definition. A diffeomorphism <p : AI -+ AI satisfies the cup-length estimate 
with respect to a ring R if #Fix( <p) is at least the cup-length cl( M, R), i.e. 
the largest integer k such that there exist cohomology classes a 1· ... , ak-1 E 
H*(M; R) of positive dimension with n1 U ... U Ok-l =I 0. 
By Lustcrnik-Schnirelman theory (see Corollary 3.8), a smooth function 
on M has at least cl(M; Z) critical points. An exact diffeomorphism which is 

5.2 Tlw Arnol'd Conjecture 
87 
C 1-close to the identity satisfies the cup-length estimate with respect to any 
ring, since it can be identified via its graph with an exact 1-form df in such a 
way that its fixed points correspond to the critical points off (cf. chapter 3). 
Definition. If the fixed points of 'P are nonclegenerate. then Fix( 'P) is finite 
and we say that 'P satisfies the ungmded Morse inequalities with respect to the 
ring R if there exists a homomorphism () : F. --> F. of the free R-module over 
Fix(<p) with 
8 o 8 = 0 
and 
ker 8 /im8 ~ H.(.\!: R). 
In particular, if this holds for some principal ideal domain R, then as in 
Corollary 5.5 we get 
#Fix(rp) ~ L,Bk. 
k 
where dk = dim H k( AI; R) is the Betti number. 
Influenced by ideas of vVitten, Gromov, and Conley, Floer defined a 'Con-
ley index· by elliptic methods. Instead, following Salamon and Zehnder we shall 
use the :.Iaslov type index introduced in section 1..±. These indexes arc easiest 
to us" when the symplectic form w vanishes on all 2-sheres in AI: wi,.2 (M) = 0. 
!\lore generally, since T ltf has a complex structure which is well defined up to 
homotopy. it has Chern classes c;(M) E H 2i(M: R) (we will only need the first 
Chern class c1; see§ 20 of [15]) and we can define: 
Definition. The symplectic manifold (M,w) is monotone if there exists k ~ 0 
such that the (de Rham) cohomology class [w]- kc1(M) vanishes on every 
2-sphere in M. 
We are now ready to cite Floer's results ([-10. Theorem 1], [42], cf. [71, 
Theorem 3.3.1]): 
Theorem 5.6 Let (M,w) be a compact symplectic manifold. 
(i) If both [w] and c1(M) vanish on rr2(M). then every exact diffeomor-
phism satisfies the cup-length estimates for every coefficient ring R. 
(ii) If (.Ill, w) is monotone, then every exact diffeomorphism with nonde-
generate fixed points satisfies the ungraded Morse inequalities with respect to 
any ring R. 
In the remaining sections of this chapter we will sketch the proof of (ii) in 
the case R = Z2, i.e. 
#Fix(rp) ~ L dim Hk(ji: Z2).

For symplicity we will also assume that [w] and c1(M) vanish on rr2(A/). The 
first condition means fsz u*w = 0 for all smooth maps u : 5 2 --. AI. This 
implies that there are no non constant holomorphic spheres in .1I. because they

The second condition will be used in the definition of a J\lorsc-type index. 
5.3 
The Variational Setup 
Let ( M, w) be a compact symplectic manifold and <p an exact diffeomorphism 
(sec the previous section). By reparametrizing the Hamiltonian H 1 with respect 
to time we may assume that H 1 depends (smoothly) on t E 5 1 = R/Z. The 
fixed points x E M of <p correspond hijcctively to the closed paths 'Pt ( x), 
0 ::; t ::; 1, that is to periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian equation 
it(t) = Xt(u(t)), 
(5.3) 
where Xt is the Hamiltonian vector field. As in [21], we introduce the space 
n.M = C.::;'ntr(S1, M) of smooth contractible loops in !vi and the space 
P=P(H) c nM 
of contractible periodic solutions of (5.3). As we shall sec below. the elements of 
P are precisely the critical points of an action functional A : SUI ---+ R. Hence 
we can count them using 'Morse theory' on the infinite dimensional space nAI. 
Note that we arc ignoring all fixed points corresponding to noncontractihlc 
loops. 
The action functional is defined by 
A(u.) =- { it*w-
{ Ht(u(t)) dt, 
Jv, 
Js, 
u E n"u. 
(5.4) 
where it: D 2 ---+ AI is a smooth extension of u: 5 1 ---+"AI. Because wj,.,(M) = 0, 
A(u) is independent of the choice of ii. (In general, it depends only on the 
homotopy class of ii with fixed boundary.) The tangent space to OAf at u 
consists of c=-sections ((t) of the pull-back bundle u*(TM). The derivative 
of A in the direction of ( is defined by 
a 
a 
dA(u)(= asls=oA(u.), 
where Uo=u, 
asls=Olls=(. 
The second term in A clearly contributes- fs, Ht(u(t))((t) dt to dA(u)(. For

Collecting tenns, the derivative of A is given by 
dA(n) ( = L { 
w(ti(t), ((t)) - dH1 ( u(t)) (( t)} dt. 
(5.5) 
Because 
tlHt (u( t)) (( t) = w(X1 (u( t)). (( t)). 
the right hand side of (.S.S) vanishes for all ( if and only if u satisfies the 
Hamiltonian equation, i.e. u E P, as claimed.

mannian metric g = 9J defined by

gradient of H, then by ( .5 .5) we get 
gradA(u)(t) = .l(u(t)) ti(t)- 'VH1(u(t)). 
(S.6) 
Note that our signs, which arc those of [71], differ from Floer's in [40] since his 
metric g satisfies g(., .) = w(L .), while they differ from those of [91], because 
there X 1 is defined by w(X1, .) = -dH1• By (.5.6) the trajectory Us E fi.M of

(5.7) 
Note that for H = 0 the solutions of (5.7) arc holomorphic curves from the 
complex manifold R x S 1 = CjiZ into the almost complex manifold (AI,.!). 
Since the elliptic equation (5.7) docs not have a well-posed Cauchy problem 
(for given u(O . . )), it docs not define a flow. But as Floer had noticed, to build 
a complex analogous to the Morse complex it is enough to have well-behaved 
spaces of trajectories which go from one critical point to another. 
The fundamental regularity and compactness result for holomorphic curves 
remains valid in the presence of a Hamiltonian term [90]. Denote by 
M = M(H,.J) 

90

Since AI is compact and wi,.2 (M) = 0, the space M is compact in the topology

The convergence is uniform in t and ~~ --> 0 uniformly in t as 181 --+ oo. In fact, if 
x and y are non-degenerate, then u converges exponentially with all derivatives 
as lsi-> oo. A loop x E Pis called non-degenerate if dct[J- d,;1(x(O))] i= 0. 
Given x, y E P(H) denote by 
M(x, y) = M(x, y; H, J) 
the space of all u E M which satisfy (5.8). This is the :;ct of absolute minima 
of the energy functional <I> subject to the asymptotic boundary condition (5.8)

Hence if u belongs to M ( x, y), then 
<I>(u) = A(x)- A(y). 
For a generic choice of the Hamiltonian H, the space M(x. y) is a finite-
dimensional manifold. As in chapter 6 this is seen by linearizing (5.7) in the 
direction of a vector field~ E C 00 (u*TM) along u. This yields the first order 
linear differential operator 
where V • ( = V u./.) V t and V ~ denote the covariant derivative with respect to 
the metric g = gJ. If u satisfies (5.8) and x, y E Pare non-degenerate, then F(u) 
is a Fredholm operator between appropriate Sobolev spaces (cf. section 1.4). 

5.4 Definition of Floer Homology 
91 
The pair (H . .!) (J compatible with w) i~ called regular if every contractible 
1-pcriodir solution of (5.3) i~ non-degenerate and F(u) i~ onto for u EM. As 
in chapter 6 one can show that the set (1-i x J)reg of regular pairs is dense with 
respect to the C""-topology (sec [91, §8]). For regular pairs it follows from an 
implicit function theorem (e.g. [65, p. 17]) that }vt(x. y) is a finite-dimensional 
manifold with local dimension ncar u equal to the Fredholm index of F(u). 
5.4 
Definition of Floer Homology 
In the regular case, the dimension of M(x, y) was used by Flocr to define a 
relative Morse index for pairs of critical points x, y E P. Namely, if cti"2 (M) = 
0, then the Fredholm index of F(u) depends only on the boundary condition 
(5.8) and we denote it by m(x,y). For every triple x.y. z E Pone has 
m(x, y) + m(y, z) = m(.r. z). 
Hence there exists a function m : P --> Z (defined up to an additive integer) 
such that the Fredholm index 
indF(1t) = m(x)- m(y) 
for every smooth map ·u: C/iZ--> AI which satisfies (-5.8). 
In particular, if m(x)- m(y) = 1, then M(.r. y) is a 1-dimcnsional mani-
fold. As in the case of Morse homology, there is an R-action on M(x, y) by shift 
in the s-Yariablc. Thus, it follows from Gromov's compactness that M(x,y) = 
M(x, y)/R is a finite set of isolated orbits if m(.r)- m(y) = 1. 
To define Flocr homology for Z2-cocfficicnts. let Ck = Ck(M; H) be the 
vector space over Z2 generated by {x E P : m(.r) = k}, k E Z. For any pair 
x,y E P set 
(ax,y) = #M(x,y) 
mod 2. 
The boundary operator ak =a!:( AI; H, J) : Ck+t __, Ck is defined by 
iAx =ax= 
(ax.y)y 
yEP,m(y)=k 
for x E P. m(x) = k + 1. 
As Floer has proven in [40], this operator satisfies a o a= 0 so that one 
gets a chain complex. Its homology 
Hf:'(M; H, J) = kera/ima 
is the Floer homology of the pair (H, J) E (7-i x :!)reg· 
\Ye sketch the proof of a o 8 = 0. One has to show that for m(x)- 1 = 
m(y) = m(.::) + 1, the matrix elements vanish: 
(88x, z) = L (ax, y) (8y, z) = 0 
mod 2.

92 
5 Floer Homology 
This is equivalent to the number of clements in Uu M(x, y) x M(y, z) ("bro-
ken trajectories") being even if m(x)- m(z) = 2. This follows from a gluing 
aryumcnt. Any pair (u,v) E M(x,y) x M(y,z) can be glued together at y to 
yield a one-parameter family {wn} of approximate solutions of (5.7) such that 
wn(s, t) = { u(s + R.. t), 
v(s- R. t), 
s:::; -1 
s ~ 1 
For R large enough there exists a genuine solution wn E M(x, z) close to 
UJn. This follows from an iteration procedure which was first applied to partial 
differential equations by C. Taubcs. It uses the linearized operator F( w R) from 
(5.9) and quadratic estimates of higher order terms [40]. (Flocr's original paper 
is not easy to read, but there seems to be no better reference.) 
For R -+ oo, wn(s - R, t) and wn(s + R, t) converge to u(s, t) and to 
v(s, t), respectively. in the Ci~,-topology. (This obviously holds for WR and 
wn,ii'n approach each other exponentially when R-+ oo.) Moreover, any con-
necting orbit in M(x, z) which is sufficiently close to the pair (u, v) must be 
a member of the family {wn}, up to reparametrization. In other words, a pair 
in M(;r, y) x M(y, z) uniquely determines a one-parameter family in M(x, z). 
Since M(x, z) is a one-dimensional manifold, this determines an interval com-
ponent of M(x, z), whose other end converges to another broken trajectory 
from x to z. Thus the broken trajectories arc paired and their number is even. 
The following theorem shows that the Floer homology is independent of 
(H. J) and nontrivial. In particular, the space M of bounded solutions is not 
empty. 
Theorem 5.7 (Floer) (a) If (H, J) and (H', J') are regular pairs then there 
exists a natural chain homomorphism which induces an isomorphism of Floer 
homology 
H[(M;H,J) ~ H[(M;H',J'). 
(b) There is a natural isomorphism between the Floer homology and the singular 
homology of AI 
H[(M;H,J) ~ H.(M;Z2). 
Note that this implies the diffeomorphism <p = <p1 described by H = H 1 
satisfies the ungraded l\Iore inequalities with respect to Z2 . The grading of the 
Floer homology groups is only defined up to an additive integer. As Salamon 
and Zehnder have shown [91], this ambiguity can be removed by using a Maslow 
type index 11 : P -+ Z which is a symplectic invariant obtained from the 
linearized Hamiltonian flow along the loop x E P (cf. section 1.4). 
In terms of this l\Iaslov index one gets (Theorem 1.15) 
indF(u) = p(x)- p(y) 

5.5 Continuation of Flocr Homology 
93 
and IL defines a natural grading for the Flocr homology groups. vVith this 
grading one has an isomorphism 
-n ~ k ~ n. 
Remarks. 1. If [w] docs not vanish on rr2(111), then A takes values in 5 1 If c1 
docs not vanish on rr2(l\I), then the Maslow index f1 is only defined modulo an 
integer N. 
2. To define the Floer homology with integer coefficients (and hence with 
coefficients in any abelian group) one has to assign an integer + 1 or -1 to 
every u E ;\;f(J·, y) with !L(~.·) -!L(y) = 1 [40, 90]. To cktcrmine these signs one 
has to consistently orient the moduli spaces M(l', y). For the details sec [43].

Continuation of Floer Homology 
In this section, following [91], we sketch the proof of part (a) of Theorem 
5.7 using the l\laslov index of section 1.4. :\Iore precisely we shall show the 
following. 
Proposition 5.8 Let (H",J"), (Hf3,Jf3) and (H'.J"!) denote regular pairs

.5 Flocr Homology 
As with the s-indcpcnclcnt case (5.7), a solution of (5.11) has hounded flow 
energy if and only if the limits (5.12) exist. 
The linearization of (5.11) in the direction of a vector field~ E C"" ( u*Ti\1) 
along u leads to the differential operator F(u): W 1•2 (u) ~ L 2(u). 
au 
F(u)~ = \7 8 ~ + J(s,u)"Vt~ + "V(.J(s,n) iJt + \7(\?H(s.t.u), 
(5.13) 
where W 1•2 (u) = 
{~ E L 2(u) : \7,~. "Vt~ E L2 (u)} and £2(u) is the Hilhcrt 
space of vector fields~ along u such that ~(s, t + 1) = ~(s, t) with norm 
As in the s-indcpcndcnt case, F(u) is a Fredholm operator whenever (5.12) 
is fulfilled and x"' E P(H"'), xl3 E P(Hf3) are non-degenerate. As before, the 
Fredholm index is 
inc! F(u) = Jl(x''; H")- J1(xf3; H!3). 
The pair (H"fJ, J<> 8 ) is called a regular homotopy if both (Hn. J") and (H!3, J!3) 
arc regular and if the operator (5.13) is onto for every bolution u of (5.11) and 
(5.12) with non-degenerate x'", :1J3. 
If (H"', .!"') and (H!3, .Jf3) arc regular, then the space of regular homotopics 
is dense in the space of all smooth homotopics from (H"', J") to (H3, Jf3) with 
respect to the topology of uniform convergence with all cleriYath·cs on compact 
sets (sec [44] and [91. §8]). 
It follows from the index formula above and the surjectivity of F( u) that 
the spaces M(x"', x!3; Ha/3, .]"'!3) arc manifolds of dimension 
climM(x"', x 13 ; H 013 , J"''1 ) = J1(x0 ; H"')- J1(f3: H 3 ). 
provided the homotopy (H"I3, .!0 13) is regular. By compactness it follows that 
M(x"',J:f3;H" 8 ,J"'f3) is a finite set if Jl(x"';Ha) = J.L(x:3:H3 ). Thus one can 
define a homomorphism <p13" : Ck(JII; H"')-> Ck(III; H 8 ). 
setting the matrix clement (<p!3"':I:"',xf3) equal to the number of connecting 
orbits in M(x"',x·3 ;H"f3,Jaf3) modulo 2. 
The maps <p3" just defined (for regular (H"'f3, J"'f3)) are chain homomor-
phisms, i.e. 
iJ!3<p(3a = 'Pf3aaa. 
The proof is omitted (sec [91, Lemma 6.2]), since it is Yery similar to that of 
a o a = 0. The induced homomorphisms of Floer homology turn out to be 

5.6 Flocr Homology Equals Singular Homology 
95 
independent of the choice of the regular homotopy (Ha 1.J"f3). They arc the 
h•3" appearing in Proposition 5.8. 
To prm·c the claimed independence one chooses a :;mouth homotopy of ho-
motopics ( H~''3 , J~(J) from ( Hg11 • .lc~'11 ) to (H;'11 , .1;") and introduces the spaces 
For a generic homotopy of homotopics this is a manifold (with boundary) of di-
mension J.L(x"; Ha) -{L(xf3; Hf1) + 1. This can be used to define homomorphisms 
<f>!3" : Ck(.\I: H")--+ Ck+J (M; Hi1) with the chain homotopy property: 
Hence cpfa and cpg" induce the same homomorphism h 3" in homology and the 
claim is proved. (For more details sec [91, Lemma 6.3].) 
It remains to show (5.10). The first property. h~" = id, follows immedi-
ately by choosing the constant homotopy. To show the second property, a.~surnc 
(H"'1, .J'd) and (HI'', Jfh) arc regular homotopies from (H", J") to (Hf1, .Ji1) 
and from (H 3 , .J.6) to (H"r, .J"r), respectively. Then for R > 0 large enough one 
can construct a regular homotopy from ( H" . .]") to ( H-· . .l') by

with fL(.z: 0 : Ha) = J.L(xf3; Hf3) = fL(x'; H') can be glued together to give a 
connecting orbit u~' E M(x"', x'; H~', J~'). Conversely, it follows from Gro-
mov's compactness that for R large enough, these glued orbits comprise all of 
M(x", :r': H~1 , J~'). Thus, for fL(x"'; H") = J.L(x'; H 1 ) = k, we get

Floer Homology Equals Singular Homology 
In this section we sketch the proof of part (b) of Theorem 5.7 as given in [91, 
§7].

5 Floer Homology 
Consider first the case of a Hamiltonian H which is independent of t and 
is a Morse function on AI. Since AI is compact, there exist;; E > 0 such that 
the period of every nonconstant periodic solution of the Hamiltonian equation 
is larger than c. Replacing H by cH. we may assume that P(H) equals the s<'t 
of critical points of H, considered as constant loops 
P(H) = {:r(t) = 
x EM: dH(x) = 0}. 
The Maslow index of a constant orbit x(t) = x of the Hamiltonian equation is 
related to its 1\Iorsc index indH(x). (To define the Maslow index one chooses 
a fixed almost complex structure on At which is compatible with w, cf. sec-
tion 1.4). 
Lemma 5.9 There exists c > 0 such that the Morse function H 
AI -> R 
satisfies \\HI\c2 < c, then 
JL(x; H) = indu (:zc)- n 
for every critical point x of H. 
For the proof. sec [91, Lemma 7.2]. The lemma has also been proved in-
dependently by Vitcrbo [102]. 
For H independent oft, every solution 1L of (5.7} which is abo independent 
of t satisfi<'s

and is therefore a gradient flow line of H. For an open dense set of almost 
complex structures J (compatible with wand determining the metric 9J(., .) = 
w(., J.)) the flow (5.14} is of Morsc-Smalc type (sec e.g. [91, Theorem 8.1]}. It 
can be shown that if H is again multiplied by a sufficiently small constant, 
then one can choose J so that at the same time (H, J) E (71. x :!)reg, (5.14) is 
a 1\lorsc-Smalc flow and every solution u of (5.7) with bounded flow energy is 
independent oft, sec [91, Theorem 7.3] and [90]. 
In this case, the Flocr complex agrees with tlw l'dorse complex of sec-
tion 5.1 with the grading shifted by n. Since the homology of the latter agrees 
with singular homology by Theorem 5.3, we get the isomorphism 
claimed in Theorem 5.7. 
This also finishes the proof of the special case of part (ii) of Theorem 5.6 
announced at the end of section 5.2. 

5. 7 Symplectic Homology

5.7 
Symplectic Homology 
In this section we shall sketch the symplectic homology theory of Flocr and 
Hofer. For more details we refer to [45, 44, 47, 59]. Essentially, for fixed generic 
H and J one builds Flocr homology groups using only periodic solutions :r 
whose action functional A(x) lies in a given intcn·al. Taking a direct limit over 
suitable pairs (H, J) one gets a homology group which only depends on the 
chosen interval. 
Let (.\f,w) be a compact symplectic manifold with boundary DJ.,I of con-
tact type (or empty). For simplicity assume 7rz (AI) = 0 and restrict to homology 
with coefficients in Zz. For a generic pair ( H, J) and a E R U { oo} define the 
free groups 
CZ(H, J) = spanz2 {x E P(H): Jl(x) = k, A(x) <a}. C'"(H, J) = EBCk(H, J). 
If u is a solution of (5.7) with asymptotic boundary data x+, x- E P(H), then 
A(x+) ::; A(x-), hence a= a(II,.J) maps cz into Ck_1. Defining the quotient 
groups 
cla,b)(H, J) = Cf(H, 1)/Cf(H, .!) (-x::; a::; b::; oo), 
a induces an operator Dk : cj~·b) ( H, .!) __, ct'.:~J (H. J) and we can define the 
Flocr homology group 
Fla,b)(H,J) = kcrak/imDk+t 
wl:ich depends on (H, .!). 
We now define admissible pairs (H, J). Let H : 5 1 x M --> [0, +oo) be 
smooth with compact support in 5 1 x (M \aM) and such that all contractible 
solutions .r of XH satisfying A(x) < 0 arc nondegenerate. (This allows to define 
F[a,b)(H . .!) for -oo ::; a ::; b ::; 0.) The almost complex structure J can be 
chosen so that every solution u : R X S 1 --> M of (5.7) and with boundary 
data x+, .r·- satisfies u(R x S 1) c AI\ aM, provided x+ and x- arc contained 
in M \ a.\1. The boundary aM is then called J-pseudoconvex. A pair (H, J) 
satisfying all these conditions is called admissible. The set of admissible pairs 
becomes a directed set with the partial ordering 
(H,.J)::; (H',J') :¢==> H(t,x)::; H'(t,:r) \f(t.x) E 8 1 x M. 
For such pairs one defines a monotone homotopy (H. j), where if: R x S 1 x 
AI--> R is smooth, j(s, t, x) is compatible with w. (H, j) = (H, .!) for s::; -so, 
(if,j) = (H',J') for s 2: So, and aii;as 2:0. Using the solutions of 
Du-

as + J(s, t, u) at - (V jH)(s. t. u) = 0, 
u(s . . ) --> x E P(H) 
(s--> -oo), 
u(s, .) --> y E P(H') (s--> +oo) 

98 
5 Floer Homology 
as in section 5.5 one constructs a natural homomorphism 
p[a,b)(H,J) _, p[n,b)(H',J') 
of Z 2-vector spaces independent of the chosen generic monotone homotopy. 
Passing to the direct limit yields the symplectic homology group 
s[n,b) = 
l~II_l p[a,b) (H, J). 
(H,J) 
For an open set U C AI we can restrict the direct limit to those pain; (H, J) 
such that the support of H is contained in S1 x (U \ DAI) and get a symplectic 
homology group of U: 
lim 
p[n,b)(H, J). 
suppHC5 1 x(U\iJAI) 
We briefly mention the main properties of these homology groups. There 
is a natural homomorphism 
and an exact sequence for -oo ::; a ::; b ::; c ::; 0: 
If U <;;; V, the inclusion induces a homomorphism 
av,u: s[a,b)(U) _, s[a,b)(V). 
A symplectomorphism '1/J : AI -> AI induces a natural isomorphism 
For '!f;(U) <;;; V define 
1/-•. = av,.p(u) o'I/J#: S[a,b)(U) _, S[a,b)(V). 
One can show that (<.po'!f;). = 'P• o'!f;. and the identity of AI induces the identity 
on S[a,b)(U). 
An important property is isotopy invariance: if V's : JI ...... JI, 0 ::; s ::; 1, 
is a smooth family of symplectomorphisms satisfying '1/J.(U) <;;; V V s, then 
('1/J.). : S[a,bl(U) _, S[a,bl(V) is independent of s. 
In general, S[n,b) is difficult to calculate, see [45, 47] for computations 
and applications. As an example, the computation of the symplectic homology 
groups of polydisks leads to a proof of a conjecture of Gromov on the symplectic 
classification of open polydisks: For r = (r1, ... , rn) with the convention 0 < 
r1::; r2::; ... ::; Tn, let D(r) be the polydisk B2(r1) x ... x B 2(rn)· Then D(r) 
and D(r') are symplectomorphic if and only if r = r'. For a proof see [45].

Pseudoholomorphic Curves 
6.1 
Introduction 
\Vith this note we want to give a ::;hort introduction to the theory of p::>cudo-
holomorphic curves considered as a tool in symplectic geometry. The invention 
and the whole foundation of thi::; theory arc due to :-I. Gromov. In the following 
only some of the simplest arguments of GromO\··::; seminal paper [50] will be 
presented but we will try to give all the details of the proofs. vVc develop the 
theory as far as to be able to prove Gromov's famous "squeezing theorem" [50, 
corollary 0.3A]. Further information on and applications of pseudoholomorphic 
curves may be found in [50, 70, 73, 75, 86, 112]. 
6.1.1 
Linear algebra of symplectic and almost complex structures 
A symplectic structure on a real vector space V is an alternating bilinear form 
w, which is nondcgencratc, i.e. kerw = { v E V I "-'( !'. V) = 0} = {0}. An 
almo::;t complex structure on V is an endomorphism .J E End (V) with J 2 = 
-lv. A hermitian metric g for J is a euclidean scalar product, such that J is 
anti::;ymmctric with rf'spcct to g. Given J and a hermitian g we get by 
w(:r, y) = g(Jx, y) 
a ::;ymplectic structure. 
DP.finition 6.1 An almost complex structure J is called compatible with a 
symplectic structure w if: 
(i) w(.r. J.r) > 0 for x =/= 0 
{ii) w(.J.r, y) + w(x, Jy) = 0, 
or equ·imlently: g(x, y) = w(x, Jy) is a hermitian metric. 
The set of all w-compatible almost complex structures is denoted by .J(u:). 
The set .J(w) is a real analytic subvariety of the vector space End(V). The 
following two propositions show that this space is very simple. 
Proposition 6.2 The space of w-compatible structures is not empty and con-
tractible. 
Proof. Gh·en any metric g on V, we get an antisymmetric endomorphism A E 
End(V) with g(Ax, y) = w(x, y). Then 
g( -A2x, x) = -w(Ax, x) = w(x, Ax)= g(A.r. Ax) > 0,

for x # 0. Consequently, -A2 has its spectrum a( -A2) in C \ ( -oo, OJ. On 
C \ ( -oc. OJ the square root has a unique branch with y'i = 1. On the open set 
P ={BE End(V) I a( B) C C \ ( -oo, 0]} 
there exists a real analytic function r : P -+ End(V) with the following proper-
tics: (i) r(B)2 = B, (ii) r(CBC- 1) = Cr(B)C- 1 forCE Ant(V) arbitrary, (iii) 
BC = CB ~ 
r(B)C = Cr(B) for C arbitrary, (iv) a(r(B)) = fo{B). When 
B is symmetric with respect to a scalar product, then r(B) will be symmetric 
with respect to the same scalar product (r is most conveniently constructed 
with the Cauchy integral). 
If we set .J = r( -A2)- 1 A, the endomorphism .J will be antisymmctric and 
.J2 = -1 v. Further 
w(x, .Jx) = g(A:r. r( -A2)- 1 Ax) 2: 0. 
vVe got a real analytic mapping g.._... .J(g) producing w-compatihlc structures. 
This proves existence which we can get abo by considering the normal form of 
w. 
But when .J1 • .J2 arc two w-compatible structures, we get two scalar prod-
nets Yi(.T, y) = '"-'(J.· . .l;y), 'i = 1, 2. Then .J(g;) = .!;. The linear homotopy 
g1 = tg1 + (1 - t)g2 of euclidean scalar products gives us a homotopy .J(gt) 
from .h to h. This proves that :J(w) is contractible. 
0 
Let us denote by Sp(V,w) the group of automorphisms of the couple (V,w). 
This is a Lie group of dimension 3n2 + n, if 2n = dimV. With a fixed metric g 
the group of cndomorphisms leaving invariant wand g, U(V, g.w) = Sp(V,w) n 
SO(V,g), is isomorphic to the· unitary group in dimension di•;\· = n. 
Proposition 6.3 The group Sp(V. w) acts on :J(w) by conjugation. 
Fixing a scalar product gives the following presentation 
:J(w)= Sp(V.w). 
U(V,g,w) 
Proof. The first assertion is easily verified. 
Given two compatible almost complex structures, .J1 and .J2 . we find a 
symplectic automorphism conjugating the first to the second: 
All complex vector spaces of a fixed dimension are isomorphic. such that we 
can find a <p E End(V) with h = <p.J1<p- 1• Let g;(x,y) = "-'(.r • .l;y), i = 
1, 2. Then g(x, y) = g2(<px, <py) will be a .J1-hcrmitian metric. All hermitian 
mctrics on a fixed complex vector space arc equivalent, so there is a ·1/J E 
End(V) commuting with .J1 and with g(x, y) = g1('1j;x,'lj;y). It is immcdiatly 
verified that w(~·.p- 1 .r.'lj;r.p- 1 y) = w(x,y), i.e. 'lj;<p- 1 E Sp(Vw) and we have 
('1j;<p-1)h('I/J<p- 1)-1 = 1/Jh'I/J-1 = h So the group Sp(V,w) acts transitively

on J(w). The isotropy group in Sp(V,w) of a w-compatible almost complex 
structure J is equal to the isotropy group of the metric g(x, y) = w(x, Jy). 
0 
The Lie algebra of the matrix group Sp(V. w) is: 
sp(Vw) ={A E End(V) I w(A:z:,y) +w(x,Ay) = 0,\;l:r,y}. 
If we fix an w-compatible almost complex structure J. then the corresponding 
unitary group has the following Lie algebra: 
u(1l, J) 
{A E End(V) I At= -A, JA =A.!} 
{A E End(V) I At= -A, w(Ax.y) +w(x,Ay) = 0, \;lx,y} 
and 
sp(V,w) ={A E End(V) I At.!= -.!A}. 
Here the tranposition is defined with respect to the hermitian metric which 
belongs to w,J. The involution I: A,__, -At leaves sp(V,w) invariant and 
decomposes this Lie algebra into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part: 
sp(V,w) = ker(I- 1) EB kcr(I + 1) = u 9 h. 
Here we have set 
h(V,.J) ={A E End(V) I AJ = -JA. At= A} 
and this is a .!-stable subspace of (real) dimension n(n + 1). 
Corollary 6.4 If we choose an w-compatible structure.!, the space J(w) gets 
diffeomorphic to h C sp(V,w) via the map A>--> e'".Je-.4.. 
Proof. Because J(w) is a homogeneous space as described in the foregoing 
proposition, we know by the elementary theory of symmetric spaces (which is 
explained for example in [22]), that J(w) is a nonpositin!ly curved space such 
that the curves t >--> etAJe-tA are the geodesics starting at J. We know also 
that J(w) is simply connected, such that there is a unique geodesic joining J 
and an arbitrary element of J(w). 
0 
The variation of the function J(A) = eAJe-A at a point Ao E h(V, J) can 
be very easily described as follows. For A0 we have the diffeomorphism 
<I>: h(V, J) _:::. J(w) ;:::._ h(V J(Ao)). 
eA Je-A = e<I>(A) J(Ao)e-<I>(A). 
This map has a differential at Ao 
'PAo = d<I>(Ao) : h(V, J) _:::. h(V. J(Ao)).

The definitions of symplectic, almost complex and hermitian structures 
on vector spaces give immediately corresponding definitions on vector bundles. 
vVe never used a basis in the proofs of the propositions about these structures, 
so all of them go over to the relative situation: 
Corollary 6.5 Let E -> X be a smooth symplectic vector bundle with sym-
plectic stmcture w. The space :J(w) ofw-compatible almost comple:r structures 
on E is parametrized by the space of sections of the vector bundle h(E, J) of 
symmetric anti-J-linear endomorphisms of E, once we lwve chosen an almost 
complex structure in :J(w). 
Remark 6.6: The variation of the function

6.1.2 
Definition of pseudoholomorphic curves 
A symplectic manifold is a manifold with a symplectic structure w on its tan-
gent bundle, with the further condition that w must be a closed 2-form. All 
symplectic manifolds of a fixed dimension arc locally isomorphic. To distinguish 
one from the other we must look at some global object attached to them. The 
idea we want to pursue is to look at some imitation of holomorphic object allied 
to a compatible almost complex structure. 
Let r: be a compact Riemann surface and AI an almost complex manifold. 
This means that on AI there is given an automorphism J ofT 11! with J2 = -1. 
The complex structun• of r: gives a canonical almost complex structure on it. 
Definition 6.7 Let f : r: -> M be a smooth map. It is called a pseudoholo-
morphic curve (or holomorphic curve for short) if its differential 
df: Tr:-> TM 
is (i, J)-linear, i.e. df o i = J o df. 

6.1 Introduction 
103 
The strategy for the following development is to show the existence of a 
holomorphic curve under some appropriate conditions. This will be done by 
a subtle \·ersiml of the continuity method. If we have a compatible almost 
complex structure for which we can find all holornorphic curves, then we cau 
show that the set of holomorphic curves cannot disappear under a deformation 
of the almost complex structure because a certain im·ariant of it, its cobordism 
class. is constant along a deformation. For this we need to provide the set of 
holomorphic curves with the structure of a smooth manifold and to show that 
this manifold is compact. 
There arc other global invariants that can be attached to a symplectic 
manifold (see section 4.2) and the result which we will give as an illustration 
of the method of holomorphic curves could also be obtained by them. 
6.1.3 
Regularity of holomorphic curves 
As for functions, the condition of being holomorphic is an elliptic equation, so 
that the smoothness required in the definition is a consequence of much weaker 
requirements. Let us write H1:: for the space of functions which arc locally 
£1'-intC'grable and whose distributional derivatives up to order k arc still Lfoc 
functions. 
Proposition 6.8 Set D = { z E C I lzl < 1} and let V be a real vector space, 
u c v open and J: u--> End(V) a rnap of class ck+I with J 2 = -1. A rnap 
f : D --> U C V of class H1~~ with p > 2 and df o i = J o df is already in 
Ck(D, t"). 
Proof. For the moment we consider a smooth f, but without the condition on 
the differential. We write h = df + J o df o i

The Moduli Space of Holomorphic Curves 
6.2.1 
The setting of global analysis 
For the moment the use of the regularity proposition is that we can embed the 
holomorphic curws in a larger set of mappings which will form a manifold in 

6.2 The Moduli Space of Holomorpllic Curves 
105 
which they form a submanifold defined hy a regular function. In this section 
we will construct this larger manifold. 
Remark 6.9: Let us suppose that we arc given a smooth vector bundle p : 
E _.. X over a smooth compact manifold which may have a boundary. vVith 
Hk·P(X. £)we denote the vector space of sections. which arc locally in H"·P, i.e. 
if we choose a triviali;mtion of E over an open subset V C X the sections should 
appear as tupcls of functions in the Sobolev space H/';:. This characterisation 
of sections of Sobolev class is clearly local: if we have a covering of X by open 
sets v;,. X = U, v;,, such that over every open set l~, we can trivialize the 
bundle and if we arc given a section which appears in all these trivialisations 
as a function in H1k~;', then this section is already in Hk·P(X, E). Because X is 
compact, we can define norms on Hk·P(X, E). \Ve choose for example a finite 
covering of trivializing charts such that some compact subsets in these charts 
still co\·cr X. Then we take Hk·P-norms over these compact sets and take the 
sum. All of the norms obtained in this way arc equivalent. 
If we assume that we have a Sobolcv imbedding into the continuous func-
tions, Hk.p <-+ C0 , then we also get an embedding Hk·P(X, E) _.. C0(X, E). 
An open set in the total space of our bundle U C E that covers the whole 
manifold. p[U] = X, defines an open set of the continuous sections: 
C0(X,U) := {s E C 0(X,E) I s(x) E u. Vx EX}. 
If we have the Sobolev imbedding into the continous functions, the set 
will be open in Hk·P(X, E). 
Now let us suppose we arc given a second vector bundle F -> X and a map 
iP : U -> F which is smooth and commutes with the projections ( iP need not 
be linear). This gives rise to a map on sections: 
defined by (<P.s)(x) = <P(s(x)). This map is smooth. 
Let N and AI be manifolds, dimRN = 2 and S should be compact. A 
connection \7 on the tangent bundle T AI gives a diffeomorphism of a neigh-
bourhood of the zero section of T AI with a neighbourhood of the diagonal in 
j\f X M: 
cxp: TM ::J U ~ 
exp[U] ~ M x M. 
We just look at the geodesic flow defined by \7: withy EM, v E TyM we have 
a unique \?-geodesic 

106 
6 Pscudolwlomorphic Curves 
which starts at y \\'ith the velocity v and which can be integrated up to t = 1 
if v is small enough. Then cxp(v) = (7r(v),exp,(,·J v), where we denote by 
7r : T 11! ---> AI the projection. 
Let f : N ___, jf be a smooth map. By f*T,\! we denote the pull-hack 
bundle and 
j*TM 2 j*U = {(x, v) E j*TM c N x TM I v E Tf(.r)'1! n U}. 
A continuous section~ of the bundle j*T,\! which takes ,·alm·s in j*U gives a 
variation g of the mapping f in the following way: 
g(J;) := exp/(.r) ~(x) =: (cxpj 0(.r). 
If we denote b.\· H 1·P(N, j*Ti\!) the Banach space of sections of the bundle 
j*T11I which are represented in a trivialisation by H1~;;, functions, we have for

Definition 6.10 The space of maps from N to 1\! of SobolP-1' class Hl.P is: 
H 1·P(N, M) := {g E C 0 (IV, M) I 3f E cx(N, M), 3 connection\' with a set of 
definition U C T.\! of the geodesic flow, 3~ E H 1·P(N. j* U) with g = cxp j 0. 
Proposition 6.11 H 1·P(N, AI) is a smooth (Hausdorff) manifold modelled on 
the IJarwch spaces Hl.P(N, j*Ti'd) with charts 
indexed by f E C'"(N,JI!) and connections \7 on TM. The tangent space at 
f E C' 00 (N, M) is 
Proof. The topology on C'0 (1V, AI), which is metric, induces a metric topology 
on the subset Hl.P(N, 1\!), which we will refine. For a connection \7 we have 
the diffeomorphism

6.2 The Moduli Space of Holomorpllic Curves

is a homeomorphism onto its image if we take C 0-topology ou both sides. To 
refiue the topology we have to consider the transformation of charts: vVc look at 
two counections \71, \7 2 and smooth mappings !J. h giving two parametriza-
tions of a neighbourhood of the diagonal: 
If we write for the open sets 
we have: 
Hl.P(N. f;'W;) 
(exp.f.T 1(exp.f.' [H 1·P(N, f~UJ)] n expj,2 [Hl.P(N, f;U2 )]) 
c H 1•11(N, f;'Ui)· 
The transformation hetweeu the charts associated to (fi, V'J) and (h, V'2) is 
induced by the map 
<I>: f;w, c f:u~ ...... f;DI 
Th(r.)M 3 ~ f-> (expX(x))- 1(expX'1,.1 0, 
which is smooth aud induces a smooth map 
So the collection of maps exp j : H 1·P(N, f*U) __, HLP(N, AI) defines a smooth 
~g.

Proposition 6.12 Let {(cp0
, U0 ), (1f'a, Va)} be pairs of charts for N and M, 
respectively: 'Pa : Ua --> N, 1f'u : V, --> AI, such that for a given map g E 
C0(N . .\!) we have g[<p, [Uo]] ~ 1f'o [V0 ]. Then g E HLP(N, M) implies 1f';;1 o 
g o 'Po E HL~. Conversely, a continuous g which in a set of cha'T'ts such that 
u"u" = N is represented by functions in HI~~. belongs to H 1·P(N, M). 
Proof. Perhaps only the second assertion is not obvious. vVe just have to re-
member that coc(N, M) is dense in C0(N, M). so that we can catch g with a 
f E cx(N, JI.I) and a connection by g = cxpj ~for some~ E C 0(N, rTAI). If 
G(x) = (f(x),g(x)) EM x M, then 
~(x) = (exp"')- 1G(x). 
The function G appears in coordinates as a function of type H1~~ and com-
position on the left by a smooth application produces again a H1~~-function, 
as alluded to in the remark 6.9 at the beginning. Hence~ E H 1·P(N, f*U), if

is a bijection and should be a trivialising chart. The transition from the chart 
given by (/!, V' 1, V' f) to the one given by (fz, V' 2, V' f) is described as follows: 
a section s E LP(X. fiE) is first transported parallclly along V' ~-geodesics to 
LP(N,(cxpX'EJ)*E) 3 T!(cxpX'EI(x), !1(x))s(x) and cxpX'E1 = cxp~2 6. 
Then this section is transported along V'2-gcodcsics to LP(N. f2 E). So let 
T 1' 2(x,y,z): Ez----> Ex 
be the parallel transport from z to y along V' 1 -geodesics with V' f and then 
from y to x along v 2-gcodcsics with V' !f. This is defined on a neighbourhood 
of the diagonal in M x !If x lvf. The change of trivialisation for the vector 
bundle t: is then 
(E, s) >-------> ( ( cxp Y,2 ) -l ( cxp X' ~), T1'2 (fz(:r ), exp Xrx) E(x ), h (.r)) s(x)). 
The application E E Th(x)M ,_. T1·2(/2(x),cxpX(x)E,JI(x)) is a smooth map

If we choose trivialisations of E with connections which are compatible with .J,

holomorphic curves for .J. 
The set of holomorphic curves can be seen locally as the zero set of some 
function defined on a chart of H 1•P(L:, !vi) and the vector bundle construction 
of proposition 6.13 might seem high brow style. But it is only the canonical 
language to formulate a local construction, which must be done anyway.

Lemma 6.18 (i) a-operators are elliptic and all have the same symbol: 
for a covector ~ E T;L. and s.c E Ex. Here, ~0 • 1 is the result of the following 
composition: 
(ii) The index of a a-operator D is given by 
in<.!( D)

where e(L.) denotes the Euler number of 'E.. 
(iii) For a a-opemtor unique continuation holds: a sections E ex('£., E) 
"IL'ith Ds = 0 and a zero of infinite order at xo E 'E. is identically zero on the 
whole connected component containing .To. 
Proof. (i) The ~ymbol is calculated by choosing f with f(.r) = 0, df(x) = ~ 
and a sections with s(x) = Sx. Then 
D(Js)(x) = 
(af0s+fDs)(x)

The application T*L.--> T 0 •1L. is an antilinear isomorphism. soD is elliptic. 
(ii) Let E and F be two complex vector bundles over 'E.. With an isomor-
phism E __. F we can conjugate a a-operator on E to an operator on F which is 
again a a-operator. i\'"ow any complex vector bundle E over a Riemann surface 
is isomorphic to a holomorphic vector bundle: if rankcE ::0:: 2. induction over 
the skeleton of a triangulation of 'E. yields a nonvanishing section of E, because 
the unit sphere bundle of E has simply connected fibres. Thus. E ~ C 87 E' 
with rank£' =rank£- 1, and inductively E ~ crankE-l e L for some line 
bundle L. But on a Riemann surface any line bundle has a holomorphic struc-
ture. The isomorphism E ~ crank E-l 81 L = F conjugates our a-operator to 
a a-operator on a holomorphic bundle with the same index. On a holomorphic 
vector bundle F there is a canonical a-operator: for a ex-function f and a 
holomorphic section s 
(This is well defined. because for an open set U which is small enough, we have 
C""(U,F) = c:x:(U) 0o(Ul O(U,F) with() as the holomorphic sections.)

(iii) This follows from Aronszajn's famous theorem: a differential operator 
on a (real) vector bundle whose symbol is multiplication by the norm of the 
cotang~nt Ycctor with respect to some metric on the base gives unique continu-
ation for the sections in its kernel. We compose the D-operator D: C""(E, E)...-. 
ex (E. Y0·1 E ()E) with another operator to get an operator with scalar sym-
bol: a RiPmannian metric on E provides a volume and Y0 •1 IZi T 1•0 ~ C. Any 
complex bundle has a a-operator. Just take the (0. 1) component of a complex 
connection. \Ve then look at the following composition: 
cx(E,E) ~ C 00 (E, T0 ' 1 1Zi E)_!:__. cx(E. T 1•0 IZi E)->

C00(E, T 0 •1 IZi T 1•0 IZi E) ~

where pis a a-operator on T 1•0 IZi E and cis a complex conjugation T 0 •1 ~ 
T 1 •0 . The symbol is obviously (e,s) >-> llell 2s.

Remark 6.19: Integration over E gives the following pairings 
C"'(E, E) x C 00 (E, T 1•1E 1Zi E*)

C""(E,T1•1E) _b_. C 
With these pairings the operator D: C 00(E,E) ...-. C""(E,T0·1 1Zi E) has a

defined by (s, D 10) = (Ds, 0) with s E C 00 (E. E), 0 E C 00 (E. T 1•0 1Zi £*). 
Then -D 1 is again a 8-operator.

The moduli space at regular almost complex structures 
To affirm that the zero set of the section g >--+ D.1g is smooth. we should know 
that the differential of this section is regular at the zeros. This may be false for 
general J. As always in such a situation we adjoin additional variables. \\'c let 
J vary in a sufficiently large manifold 7-l, so that 
is smooth and then we apply the Sard-Smalc theorem ( cf. proposition 6.23 
below) which provides regular values of the projection of this set onto 7-f.. This 
7-l should be a manifold and the next lemma provides us with a sufficiently 
large manifold consisting of smooth w-compatiblc almost complex structures. 
Lemma 6.20 Let E _, 1U be a smooth finite dimensional vector bundle. As-
sume that 11! is compact. There exists a Banach space

For the second partial derivative we get by the remark 6.6 
\Ve want to show that DP is surjective. The operator D1P(O is au ellip-
tic differential operator ami as such it is a Fredholm operator. Thus, because 
rangeD 1P has finite codimension and raugcD 1P C rangcDP. the subspace 
rangeDP is closed. Let us take a vector 'I E L'~('L. T1.0 'L 
(J*TM)*) 
orthogonal to the image of rangeDP. Then 
(DIJ5(0,71) = 0, ~~~ E H 1 ·~'('L,j*TM). 
(['Pn 0 (ci), .J(ao)]J(oo)rlj, 71) = 0, lfri E 'H. 
( 6.1) 
Of course ['Pn 11 ((i) . .J(uo)] = 2<p"0 ((i).l(Go). Let us look at a point ;:;0 E 'L, where 
df(z0 ) i= 0, f~ 1 f(zo) = zo. Then there exists a neighbourhood W of f(zo) in 
Manda disc B c 'L around z0 , such that f~ 1 [rV] = B and f 
18 : B--> AI is 
au imbedding. !\ow we observe that. given a nonzero vector v0 in a symplectic 
vector space V with a compatible complex structure j we have h(V, j)v0 = V 
(to sec this, it suffices to look at the problem in complex dimension 1). Thus if 
7J(z0) i= 0, we find a E cx(M, h(T:\1, .!(Go)) with support in Wand with 
-(<,?o 0 (ci).l(no)df,TJ) > 0. 
\Vc approximate• the section (t by sections on 'H to conclude that we get a con-
tradiction to equation (6.1) above. Thus TJ(zo) = 0 and because the argument 
applied for z0 \Yorb for a whole neighbourhood of z0 , the section TJ must be 
zero on an open set. But DIP is a a-operator and (-(Dd3>)tTJ,f.) = 0. Thus 7) 
is smooth (as a weak solution of an elliptic operator) and by Aronszajn's the-
orem (lemma 6.18), 17 vanishes everywhere. So DP is surjective at the zeroes 
of P and this section is transversal to the zero section of IIi £~· 1 and we may 
conclude that their intersection, i.e. the zero set of P is a smooth manifold. 0 
\Vc finally come to prove the proposition we aimed at in this section. To 
proceed in the construction of the moduli space we will usc Smale's extension 
of Sard's theorem to Banach manifolds.

J' E X the differential d<I>(:r) : T:rX ---+ T,N.r.)Y is a Fredholm operator. 
Then the set of crdimlvalues

on a closed subset A C W (i.e. \:/y = g(w) = if>(.r): g.T.,.W + if>.TxX =

is transversal to if> and g' lA= g lA· (OJ course the set A may be empty.) 
A point y in Y is called a regular· value if it is not a critical value, i.e. 
either y <f. if>[X] or y = if>(x) and dif>(x) is surjective. In any case q.- 1(y) is a 
closed submanifold in X, whose tangent space at x E q.- 1(y) is kerdif>(x). 
The condition which appears in lemma 6.22 and also in proposition 6.24, 
namely that the holomorphic curve should be an embedding somewhere, i.e. 
:Jz E ~: df(z) =F 0, f- 1f(z) = {z}, will he replaced by a homological criterion 
in Sf'ction 6.3.1. 
Proposition 6.24 Let J be a smooth almost complex structure on a compact 
manifold _1[, 'H C cx(AI, h(TM)) as ·in corollary 6.21, ~ a closed connected

is a smooth manifold for a generic n E 'H. Its dimension is

Proof. For simplicity we shall write P instead of P from now on. In the previous 
lemma we arrived at 
MJ.t = p- 1(0) n {(f,n) E c=(I:,J\1) x 1-£1 :lz E I:

So ker DIT2 = ker D2 P. Evidently, we have 
range DIT2 = D2P- 1(rangc D1P),

where D2P passed to the quotients: D2P. The operator D2P is trivially injec-
tive. Because DP = D1 P Ell D2 P is surjective, following the proof of lemma 
6.22, the application D2 P is also surjective. Consequently. we have 
cokcr Dfr2 ~ cokcr D1P. 
Now D1 P is a Fredholm operator, so f:r2 is a Fredholm map. The Sard-Smalc 
theorem then tells us that fi2 has a dense set of regular values. So for such a 
regular value a E 'H C C00 (.M,h(TM)), the set Mj(a) is a smooth manifold

Definition 6.25 An almost complex structure J on M is called regular, if for 
all holomorphic curves in Mj the differential operator of lemma 6.16 
has vanishing cokernel. 
In view of the proof of the proposition 6.24 we can formulate the conclusion 
of this section as a corollary: 
Corollary 6.26 There exists a dense set of smooth w-compatible regular com-
plex structures J (for which the moduli space Mj is a smooth manifold}.

Comparison of moduli spaces at different complex structures 
Consider once again the assertion of lemma 6.20. \\"e can construct a space 
1i C cx(JI,E), which contains a finite number of given smooth sections. If 
the section s is not in 1i we form the new space 'H' = 1i \B Rs with the norm 
lit+ rsJJ·w = JJtJ!?-t+ I r J. 
Proposition 6.27 If Jo, J1 E J(w) are two regular structures, then there 
exists a smooth path 1: [0, 1] --> J(w), such that

Proof. \\"e choose a Banach space 1i C J(w) which contains Jo and Jt as indi-
cated before. Then as in lemma 6.22 we have the following smooth submanifold 
of H 1·P(L.. M) x 'H: 
M1t ={(f. J) I f is J-holomorphic and3z E L: df(:::) # 0, rl f(z) = {z} }. 
The index of the projection 
IT: M1t ->'H 
is again equal to the index of the a-operator corresponding to these maps (proof 
of proposition 6.24). Thus Jo, J1 arc regular values for IT. We join Jo to J1 by an 
arbitrary smooth path in 'H. With the second part of the Smale-Sard theorem 
we can perturb the path to get a path 1 which is transversal to the projection 
TI and this perturbation can be done such that the endpoints of 1 are Jo, J1

Compactness of the Moduli Space 
In this section we consider some aspects of the global structure of the moduli 
space of holomorphic curves. The aim of the first section 6.3.1 is corollary 
6.34, which replaces the somewhat technical condition of nondegeneracy of the 
curves appearing in proposition 6.22 by a condition on the homology class 
represented by the curves. The sections 6.3.2 up to 6.3.4 construct tools to 
force the moduli space to be compact. This will be used in section 6.3.5, which 
treats a question of existence for holomorphic curves by some sort of continuity 
method as announced in section 6.1.2.

6 Pseudolwlomorpliic Curves 
6.3.1 
A homological criterion for injectivity 
We want to consider a holomorphic curve f : ~ ---. JU from a Riemann surface 
into an almost complex manifold, for which there docs not exist a point z0 E ~ 
such that df(zo) f= 0 and /- 1 f(zo) = {zo}. Certainly we expect the set of 
critical points of f to be discrete in ~. so that essentially the map f must 
cover its image several times. So we will desingularisc the image of f to get 
a Riemann smfacc of which ~ will be a branched coYer and a factorisation 
of J, such that the homology class off will be a multiple of the class of this 
dcsingularisation. If we prescribe that the homology class of f is indivisible, 
there must be a point zo E ~such that df(zo) f= 0 and f- 1 /(::0 ) = { z0 }. 
Remark 6.28: Let us denote by D = { z E C I lzl < 1} th0 standard open 
disc. The theor0m of Aronszajn hils the following wrsion, which is stronger 
than the one cited in 6.18. We call a map f: D---. R 2n with /(0) = 0 fiat at 
the origin 0 E D. if we have for arbitrarily high N > 0 an estimation 
for z in some neighbourhood of the origin. The theorem of Aronszajn asserts 
that a smooth f : D ---. R 2", flat at the origin, which satisfies the differential 
inequality 
11::::. /(z)l :S cl/(z)l + ld/(z)l} 
with some constant c > 0, must be equal to zero on a whole neighbourhood of 
the origin. 
In this section we can forget that the almost complex structure on AI stems 
from a symplectic one. 
Corollary 6.29 Let M and ~ be equipped with some auxiliary metric. Let 
f: ~ ~ M be a holomorphic curve which is fiat at a point z0 E ~. i.e. for all 
N > 0 there exists a c(N) > 0 with 
distM(/(z), f(zo)) :S c(N)distE(z, zo).v. 
for z in some neighbourhood of zo. Then f is constant on the whole connected 
component of ::o. 
Proof. If f is flat at zo then all the derivatives of f with respect to some choice 
of coordinate systems around zo and /(z0 ) must Vdnish. Thus the set of flat 
points of a smooth map is closed. Relative to some charts we can express f by 
a function g : D(z0 ) ~ R2" defined on some disc centered at z0 . Then as in 
the proof of proposition 6.8 the function g satisfies a differential equation of 
the form 
l:::.g = q(g.dg,dg). 

6.3 Compactness of the 1\Iodnli Space 
121 
Here q is a bilinear form in the last two argumcnb with coefficients which arc 
smooth functions in the first. Thus on a compact neighbourhood of z0 we get 
lll.g(z)l::; cldg(zW::; c'ldg(z)l. 
and with the theorem cited in the previous remark 6.28, we can conclude that 
g = 0 on a neighbourhood of zo. Thus the set of flat points is also open. 
D 
Corollary 6.30 For a smooth holomorphic curve f : ~ -> Ji.I which is non-
constant on every connected component, the set of critical points 
C = {z E ~I df(z) = 0} 
is discrete. 
Proof. Let zu E ~ be a critical point. 'Without loss of generality we may assume 
that ~ = D. z0 = 0, Ji.I = R 2" and f(O) = 0. Let J denote the almost complex 
structure on R 2". The value .J(O) = .10 gives to the vector space R 2" the 
structure of a complex vector space. If f were flat at the origin, the map f 
would be constant on the component of zo (corollary 6.29). Let T1 be the lowest 
order term in the Taylor expansion at the origin: 
T1 is a homogenous polynomial of degree l in x, y where z = x + iy. Thus we 
get for the almost complex structure on R 2n 
J(f(z)) = .lo + O(lzn. 
The comparison of terms of equal order in the equation df i = ( J o f) df leads 
to: 
dT1 o i = J0 o dT1. 
Thus dT1 must be a Jo-holomorphic polynomial: Tt(z) = az1, with a E R 2" \ {0} 
and 
This shows that the zero set of the differential 
df(z) = laz1- 1 + O(lzn 
contains zero as an isolated point. 
D 
The implicit function theorem for holomorphic mappings permits to bring 
an honest holomorphic curve to a standard form near a regular point. The same 
is true for pseudoholomorphic curves. 

122 
6 Pseudofwlomorphic Curves 
Lemma 6.31 Let f : D ---> AI be a holomorphic curve defined on the di::;c and 
which is regular at the origin: df(O) op 0. Then there e:rist::; a diffeomorphi.wn 
<I> : V---> R 2" defined on a neighbourhood of f(O) with the following properties: 
(i) (<I>of)(J:+iy)=(x,y,O, ... ,O) onf- 1V. 
(ii) <I>,J is standard along R 2 x {0} <;;; R 2". 
Proof. If we restrict f to a small neighbourhood of the origin we may assume 
that it is an imbedding. Along f we choose vector fields a 1• b1 •• •• an, b, which 
form at each point a base of the corresponding tangent space to AI in the 
following way: 
iJ 
EJ 
Cl[ =f.-;;;-. bt = f,-i) ' 
u:r

where x, y arc the standard coordinates on the disc and the other fields arc 
chosen transversal to f such that 
Jai = b;, Jb; = -a;. 
We pick a connection V on A/ which is compatible with .J and by integrating 
V -geodesics, we df'finc the following map: 
(x, .IJ, J'2. yz, ... , Xn, y,) f-> exp J(x+iy) (x2a2 + ... + Ynb,). 
The diffeff'ntial of this map is an isomorphism in a neighbourhood of the origin 
and it is also ( J0 , J)-linear if we denote again by J0 the standard almost complex 
structure on R 2n The inverse of this local diffeomorphism gives <I>. 
D 
vVith the aid of this lemma we can show that the intersection of two 
holomorphic c11n·es cannot be too wild. 
Proposition 6.32 Consider two holomorphic curves f. q : D ---> JU defined on 
the di::;c, such that there e1:ist two sequences { z;} iEN, { tc;} ,EN in D with the 
properties: 
(i) f(z;) = g(u.·,). ViE N 
(ii) limi~oo z, = lim,~ 00 Wi = 0 
(iii) Zi oF 0, W; oF 0. ViE N. 
Iff is regular at the origin then there exists a holomorphic map 'lj; : W ---> 
D defined on on open neighbourhood of the origin in D such that 
g = f 0 1!;. 

6.3 Compactness of the J\Joduli Space 
123 
Proof. Because the property in question is a local one. we may again assume 
that JU = R 2" with a variable almost complex structure. By lemma 6.31 we 
may assume that f has the following form: 
such that the almost complex structure J is standard along Vt : J [v, = Jo. 
Corresponding to this decomposition the map g can be written as g = (g1, fj). 
Let us first assume that g is not fiat at the origin. Then we may proceed as in 
the proof of lemma 6.31 and write 
g(z) = 1/(z) + O([z[1+1 ) 
Yt(z) = p(z) + O([z[1+ 1). 
where T, is a nonvanishing homogenous polynomial in x. y of degree l and pis 
also a polynomial. Because J [v, = Jo we have 
if we let v = ( v1, v) vary in a compact neighbourhood of the origin. Thus, 
J(g(z)) = Jo + O(tzn 
and comparing terms of equal order in the equation dg i = (Jog )dg shows that 
where a E R 2" \ {0}. Thus the intersection points off and g could not accu-
mulate at the origin. 
Thus g is fiat at the origin and we will show that it satisfies the necessary 
differential inequality needed to apply Aronszajn's theorem. The function g 
satisfies: 
L.g(z) = aJ(g(z)) ag (z) _ aJ(g(z)) ag (z).

The endomorphism J can be decomposed according to the decomposition 
R 2n = V1 EB V: if rr1, rr2 denote the canonical projections of V1 EB V we write 
J1 = rr2Jlv, : V1 ~ i>. 
1 = rr2Jlv : v ...... fr. 
Thus we get:

where d./1 = d.J1 + d1 .11 i~ the decomposition of the differential according to 
R 2" = vl EB V. Becau~e d1J = d1.lt = 0 along Vt, we have ld1.Jl(g(z))l s

I!:,. g(z)l S c{lii(z)l + ldii(z)l} 
and we conclude that g vanishes in a neighbourhood of the origin. We finish by 
taking 1j; = 91·

After these preliminaries we can prove the proposition we aimed at. vVe 
call a homology class a E H.(M,Z) divisible if there exists a 3 E H.(M,Z) 
and a d E Z, d f ±l. ~uch that a = d(J. 
Proposition 6.33 Let .E be a closed connected Riemann surface and AI an 
almost complex manifold. Let f : .E _, AI be a holomorphic curve, such that 
the homology class j. [.E] E H2(M, Z) is not divisible. Then there exists a point 
zo E .E, such that 
df(zo) i 0, r
1f(zo) = {zo}. 
Proof. Let us assume that there exists no point with the required property. vVe 
will construct a desingularisation .E' of the image of J, which will be a Riemann 
surface and we will get a factorization 
.E' 
M 
with a ramified covering 1r of degree d > 1. Then j. [.E] = f~ 1r. [.E] = d J; [.E'] 
and the class of f is divisible. 
The critical points of f form a finite set C C .E. All the fibers of f lr:\C 
must have more than one point. Let the set B ~ .E \ C be defined by z E B ~ 
3z' E r
1 f(z): 'i neighbourhoods V, V' of z, z' resp., one has f[V] f f[V']. 
Then, by proposition 6.32 the points of B can only accumulate on C. Then 
B c .E \Cis discrete and r = f[.E \(CuB)] c M is a submanifold, i.e a 
Riemann surface. \Ye have the factorization: 

6.3 Compactncs;; of the 1\.Ioduli Space 
125 
E \ C ~ E \ (CuB) 
p 
r 
~\ I 
M 
where p is a covering of degree d > 1. In a first step we will extend p over the 
points of B. 
For a point b E B we can find a disc D( b) ~ E \ C centered at b with 
D(b) n B = {b} and such that f ID(b) is an imbedding. Thus the punctured elise 
D(b)* = D(b)- {b} gets imbedded into r by f. We can glue holomorphically 
to r a full disc via f ID(b)'. Another point b' in the fiber f-l f(b) has either 
a neighbourhood V' for which there exists a neighbourhood V of b, such that 
f[V'] = f[V]. or for all such pairs of neighbourhoods which arc small enough 
one has f[\'] n f[V'] = f(b) = f(b') (sec proposition 6.32). Thus we can un-
ambigow;ly complete the surface r to a surface f'. such that p cxtcmb to a 
( unramified) co\·ering p' : E \ C --+ f' and such that we still have a factorization: 
p' 
I:\C ----

!\ I 
M 
Now we have to extend this diagram over the critical points. The surface 
I: \ C is of finite topological type, by what we mean that its fundamental group 
1r1 (I: \ C) is finitely generated. 1r1 (f') contains 1r1 (I: \ C) as a subgroup of 
index ~ d. Thus f' is also of finite topological type. Consequently, there exists 
a closed surface I:', such that r' is the complement of a finite set of points of 
~ 1 • Thus we find inside f' a compact set K, such that its complement r' \ K 
is a finite union of disjoint smooth punctured discs. Holomorphically these 
punctured discs arc annuli: 
m 
r' \ K ~ U A(r;). 
i=l 
where A(r) = {z E C I r < lzl < 1} and r < 1. 
Now p'-1(!\) ~I: is closed. Let I: \p'- 1(K) = U.7~1 uj be the decomposition

in connected components. Then C C I: \ p'- 1 ( K) and 
p' I UJ \ (UJ n C) ...._. A(r,) 
should be a covering for suitable i.j. Then U1nc = {c1 } and UJ \ {r:J} ~ A(r1), 
where r1 is some root of r,. Then i'J = 0 and r·i = 0 for all i. X ow that we know 
that the ends of r' arc punctured holotuorphic discs, the holomorphic structure 
of f' determines unambigously such a structure on I:' and we can extend p' to 
7f : I: --+ I:' by Riemann's theorem of removability of singularities.

For a homolog~· class n E H2(Af; Z) we define 
MJ(a) := {J: I:--+ M I f is J-holomorphic and j.[I:] =a} 
and more generally by adding the hypothesis on the homology class represented 
hy the curves we define JVltt(n) and M,(n). 
Obviously \W have versions of corollary 6.26 and proposition 6.27 with 
this additional restriction on the homology class. Tlms we get the following 
assertion: 
Corollary 6.34 Let C\ E H2(M; Z) be an indivisible homology class. Then 
there is a dense set of regular compatible almost complex structures J E :J(w), 
such that MJ(o) is smooth. 
For two regular structures It, .h there exists a smooth path 1: 1--+ :J(w), 
such that M.,(o) is a smooth cobordism from MJ, (n) to .~vth(u). 
6.3.2 
An apriori inequality 
vVith this section \\"C begin to study in which way a sequence of holomorphic 
curves can diverge in the moduli space. If the Riemann surface has a noncom-
pact automorphism group, there arc obviously sequences in the moduli space 
which have no convergent subsequence. But there might also he extrinsic rea-
sons for a lack of convergence. Let us consider the following example. 
We blow up C 2 at the origin to get the space 
with its canonical projection 7f : C2 __, C 2 , which restricts to an isomorphism 
on the complement of the exceptional divisor 7f- 1(0, 0). There arc two affine 
charts 
A1 : (u, v) >--> (v, uv, [1, u]) 
A2: (11, v) >--> (uv, v, [u, 1]). 

6.3 Compactness of the Moduli Space 
127 
In these charts the exceptional divisor appears as the set { v = 0}. For r:: of 0 we 
define the holomorphic curve f,(t) = 1r- 1(c:.t). In the charts A 1,A2 this line 
appcaro as: 
2 
c 
and 
fc (t) = ( t. t). 
As long as t of 0, these maps converge locally uniformly for r:: --> 0 to f( t) = 
1r- 1(0, t) = (0, t. [0, 1]). To recognize what happens at t = 0 we rescale to a new 
paranH'trisation t' = r::- 1t and get in the first chart t' >--> (t'. c:), which converges 
for r:: --> 0 to a parametrisation of the exceptional divisor omitting the point 
(0, 0, [0. 1]) E 1r- 1 (0, 0). But the same point is also missing on the curve f. We 
conclude that we must consider the singular object 1r-I ( { 0} x C) U 1r- 1 (0, 0), 
a line with a sphere attached at the origin, as some sort of limit of the family 
k 
In the following we will derive an apriori inequality which permits us to 
control this appearance of additional spheres. 
Remark 6.35: In this section we consider again a symplectic manifold (M,w) 
with a compatible almost complex structure J. On the surface ~ we choose a 
metric 11 in the conformal class of the complex structure, and on AI we choose 
a me~ric g which is not necessarily compatible with ('-'-'- J). The differential of a 
smooth map f: ~--> NI is pointwise a homomorphism df(z) : Tz~--> Tf(zJM 
between euclidean vector spaces and as such it has a norm 
lldfll 2 = Tr((df)* 0 df). 
The metric on ~ determines a volume form dvl' and the energy off is dPfincd 
by 
E(f) = i ildfii 2dvl'. 
We define the area off to be 
a(!)= lf*w. 
For these two quantities we have the following relations: 
(i) Even if g is not compatible with w, the form lldfll 2dvl' only depends on 
the conformal class of the metric Jl, 
(ii) if (..;.J,g) arc compatible and f is holomorphic. then 

128 
6 Pscudoholomorphic Curves 
To sec this, let us consider the differential df : TL. -t f*TM as a f*TM-
valucd 1-form. The metric on TM provides a pairing of rr11I-valucd 1-forms: 
evaluated on two tangent vectors v, w the paired forms should give 
g(a. i3)(v,w) = g(o:(v),jJ(w))- g(o:(w). 3(e)). 
The metric on L. gives the Hodge star operator* : A'~T*L. ~ 
i\ 2 -'~T*L., defined 
by n 1\ *f3 = J.L( o:, j])dv1,, for scalar valued forms. This extends to an operation 
on j*T 1\1 -valued forms and then we have 
(Take an orthonormal basis e1, e2 of a tangent space and ..;1, u..·2 dual 1-forms. 
Then *df = *(el(J)..,·1 + e2(J)w2) = e1(J)w2 - e2(J)w1 such that 
But in the middle dimension the Hodge star is always conformally invariant. 
As for the second assertion, let v, w be two tangent vectors on "'E. For a 1-form 
the Hodge star is *a(v) = -o:(iv). Thus 
g(df, *df)(t•, w) 
-g(df(v),df(iw)) + g(df(u').df(iv)) 
-g(df(v), Jdf(w)) + g(df(u'), Jdf(v)) 
-2g(df(v), Jdf(w)) 
2w(df(v), df( w)). 
\Ve formulate our conclusion as a lemma: 
Lemma 6.36 Let f : L. --+ ]}f be a holomorphic curve, let J.L be a metric on L, 
in the conformal class of i and let g be a metric on ]l,f compatible with (w, J). 
Then f*w 2: 0 and if L. is compact, the energy is a topological invariant: 
~E(J) = l f*w = ([w], f. [L.]), 
where [w] denotes the de Rham class of the symplectic structure. 
Remark 6.37: By the way, the same sort of calculations as in remark 6.35 
shows another important property of holomorphic curves. Let f : L, --+ ]}f be 
a holomorphic curve and let (w, J, g) be compatible. Then the metric induced 
by g on "'E, J*g, has the volume form 

6.3 Compactnc&& of the 1\Ioduli Space

To sec this. let x E Tz 'f:. be a tangent vector. Then x and ix arc an orthogonal

w(df(x),df(i:r)) = .,,;(df(.r) . .ldf(:r))

We :-;ce that a holomorphic curve is a minimal surface with respect to the

Remark 6.38: To prove the a priori inequality of proposition 6.42 we shall usc 
a connection on the tangent bundle with a special torsion tensor. In general 
we cannot expect to have a connection compatible with the almost complex 
structure and without torsion (because the existence of such a connection is 
equivalent to the integrability of the almost complex structure). 
\Ve first consider the decomposition of forms with values in a complex 
vector bundle. On an almost complex manifold .U we can decompose the R-
linear differential forms with values in a complex vector bundle E according to 
type: 
HomR(AR_TJ\/, E) 
(HomR(AR_TM. R) CR C) ®c E 
Homc(A(:(TM IZIR C), C) ®c E

where Homc(TM@ C, C) = T 1•0 M EB rD· 1 J\J according to the decomposition 
T M &R C = T J\I EB T M with respect to the eigem·alues ±i of the almost

A connection Von the tangent bundle has a torsion T: TM 0 Tlvl--. TM 
defined by 
T(X, Y) = "VxY- \i'yX- [X, Y] 
for two vector fields X, Y. This tensor can be considered as a 2-form with values 
in T AI. Thus it may be decomposed according to type as described before. We 
observe that if the torsion tensor has no (1,1)-component, its restriction to a 
complex line in a tangent space will be zero. 
Lemma 6.39 On an almost complex manifold with a hermitian metric there 
exists a unique connection which is compatible with the almost complex structure 
and with the metric such that its torsion tensor has vanishing {1.1 )-component. 
Proof. 'We recall \vhat we mean by compatibility. The connection V is com-
patible with the metric g if for all tripels of vector fields X, Y. Z it is true 
that 
X(g(Y,Z)) = g("VxY,Z) + g(Y, "VxZ). 
and Vis compatible with the almost complex structure J if "Vx(JY) = J"Vx Y. 
By linearity we may extend V to operate on sections of the complex tangent 
bundle TcM = TM 0R C and by sesquilinearity we can also extend the her-
mitian metric. We have the splitting T M 0R C = T M ffi T M and we call the 
sections of the first summand of type (1,0) and of the second of type (0,1). These 
two subbundles are mutually orthogonal. Because V is compatible with J, it 
preserves type: for X any section and Z a section of type (1,0) the derivative 
"VxZ is again of type (1,0) etc. 
We choose an orthonormal complex frame of type (1,0): Z 1, ... , Zno Then 
we have for all i 
(6.2) 
with some 1-forms e{. The compatibility with g gives e{ = -Gj. Let us again 
by T denote the torsion tensor as a Tc-valued 2-form (extended by C-linearity 
to TcM). Let a 1 •.•. an be the (l,D)-forms dual to the Z;'s. Then the definition 
of the torsion reads 
(6.3) 
Here ai oT(X, Y) = ai(T(X, Y)). On the other hand, an arbitrary antihermi-
tian matrix of 1-forms defines a connection via (6.2) whose torsion can be read 
off from equation (6.3). The tensor T has no (1,1)-component exactly if ai o T 
has no (1,1)-component for all j. 
We pick an arbitrary connection V which is compatible with J and g. 
Locally we try to adapt the connection given by 8j = 8~ + 1) to the imposed

Remark 6.40: INc recall some generalities from differential calculus. Let E -+ 
X be a smooth vector bundle and let n:~(E) be cx(X. ,\PT* X 09 E). Then a 
connection, which is a differential operator \7: rl'UE)-+ 0.J,..(E), extends to a 
covariant exterior differential 
by the definition 
\Vith metrics on X and on E we may form the formally adjoint operators 
and the covariant Hodge-Laplace operator: 
The metric on X gives the Levi-Civita connection on T X and on APT* X. Thus 
we can differentiate covariantly the sections in 0.\: (E) and we get a differential 
operator 
\7: rl),(E)-+ C 00 (X, T* X Q9 APT* X g E) 

132 
6 P:;eudolwlomorphie Curve:; 
which again has a formally adjoint operator and we can form v* v. Although 
the operators 6 and v*\7 arc both of second order, their difference is of order 
zero. The Weitzenbiick formulae dc~cribc this difference for low degrees, and 
in particular for p = 1 we have 
6s = 'V*'Vs +so Rice+ KE(s). 
Here we consider the Ricci tensor of the metric on X, whic-h by its usual def-
inition is a symmetriC" tcn~or of type (0,2), as a symmetric cndomorphi~m of 
the tangent bundle. The operator J<E is an endomorphism which is pointwise 
a linear function of the curvature tensor of the connection on E. 
Remark 6.41: In the proof of the following proposition 6.-12 we shall make 
usc of Morrey 's mean val-ue inequality (for a proof sec [48, Thm 9.20]). 
Let D(1, 0) = { z E C : lzl < 1} be the ~tandard disc with its standard 
metric and let u be a positive smooth function on it, which satisfies the following 
differential inequality 
6u = d* du ::; au, 
with a positive number a. Then u satisfies also 
u(O) ::; c(a) j 
u 
D(l,O) 
with a constant c independent of u. 
Proposition 6.42 Let (l'VI, w) be a closed symplectic manifold with a compati-
ble almost complc.T structure J. Let~ be a compact Riemann surface and U ~ ~ 
an open subset with U n 8~ = 0. The manifolds 111, ~ are equipped with the her-
mitian metrics g and J.L and the energy of a map f : ~ --... M is defined with 
respect to them (see remark 6.35), 
e(J)dv~" = g(df, *df) = Tr((df)t o df)dvw 
In this situation there exist constants C, E, ro > 0 such that for e!'ery holomor-
phic map f : ~ --> AI with

6.3 Compactness of the Moduli Space 
133 
Proof. (1) The differential of J, df : TL. -> f*TM, is a 1-form with values in 
f' T AI. On AI we choose a connection with torsion tensor T and we pull it back 
to j*T:\I where we note it by V. Then we haw the relation of remark 6.17 
which can be written in the style of remark 6.40 as 
d" df = j*T. 
By the hypothesis on f the subspaces j.TzL. C Tf(z)·\I arc complex lines. If 
we choose on 1\I the canonical connection of lemma 6.39 we have 
d"df = 0. 
The adjoint operator (d")* can be expressed by the Hodge star operator: 
(d")* = - * d" *· But on a 1-form a: on L. the Hodge star operates as the 
complex structure: ( *Ct )( v) = -a(iv) (because the metric J.L is in the conformal 
class of i). Thus we get 
- * d" * df 
*d" (df 0 i) 
*d" (.Jdj) 
*.Jd" df = 0. 
We conclude that df is a harmonic section, 6df = 0. \Ye put this immediately 
into the \\"citzcnbock formula of remark 6.40: 
0 = \l*\ldf + df 0 Rice+ xrTM (df). 
With this equation we estimate the ordinary Laplacian of the energy function: 
6e(f) = d*de(f). Let us also look at the scalar product on 1-forms 
(a:, (3)dvp = g(a:, *!3). 
Then e(f} = (df, df) and

(2) Because L. is compact, we can cover it by charts which are holomor-
phically discs and such that the standard metric of the discs and the metric 
on L. are compatible with global comparison constants. Because the energy 
functions relative to these metrics are also comparable. we may assume that 

134 
6 Ptieudulwlumorpllic Cun'es 
~ = D(ro,O) = {z E C: lzl < ro} for some small ro. We may also assume 
that the disc D( r, z) of the assertion is the disc D(r, 0) in standard metric and 
centered at the origin. 
\Vc first dcriw an inequality of the form

D(r-t,O) 
fortE [O,r]. This function attains a maximum at t 0 E {O,r]. If s{t0 ) ~ 1 we 
arc clone by taking t = r/4. 
Thus let us assume that s(to) > 1 and let zoE D(r- to,O) be a point at 
which e{f)(zo) = supD(r-to,O) e{f) =eo. We rescale the map fin a neighbour-

But e(r)(O) = 62e(f)(zo) = 1/4 which leads to a contradiction if JD(r,o) f*w

Weak compactness 
This and the following section will translate the basic a priori inequality of 
proposition 6.42 into more tangible properties of holomorphic curves. 
Corollary 6.43 Let (.M,w) be a closed symplectic manifold with a compatible 
almost complex structure J and let I: be a closed connected Riemann surface. 
Then there exists a constant c > 0, such that a holomorphic curve f : I: -+ l\1 
with JE f*w ::; c is constant. 
Proof. By proposition 6.42 there exists a constant c', such that 
supe(J)::; c' r f*w.

as soon as the area off is small enough. But if 1 : [0, 1] -+I: is a smooth path 
on I:. we have a path f o 1 joining J(r(l)) and J(r(O)) with a length l(f o 1) 
estimated by 

136 
6 Pseudolwlomorphic Curves 
Thus there is a constant c > 0, such that for IE f*w :::; c the whole image of 
f lies in a geodesic ball of M. Consequently the homology class f. [I:] is trivial 
and IE f*w = 0. Thus e(f) = 0 and f is constant. 
0 
Lemma 6.44 Let I:. M and U ~ I: bP- as in the statement of proposition 6.42. 
There exists a constant c > U, such that any sequence of holomorphic curves 
f,. : U-> AI, n E N. with IE f,:w :::; c has a subsequence converging in ex-
topology. 
Proof. By proposition 6.42 we know: If c is small enough, then the differentials 
{ df,.} arc locally uniformly bounded in sup--norm and so the family Un} is 
cquicontinous. The manifold A/ is assumed to be compact, so that there exists 
a subsequence converging locally uniformly. We call it again {f,}. Now we 
may look at this sequence in some coordinate charts where the f, 's satisfy the 
equation 
6fn = q(f,, df,., df,) 
(cf. p. 103). The sequence{!,} is bounded in H1~~ for any p. Thus q(fn, df,, dfn) 
is bounded in Lfoc and elliptic regularity for the Laplace operator implies that 
Un} is hounded in H1
2;~ for any p. Arguing inductively, we sec that the sequence 
is bounded in H1~;, and by the Sobolcv imbcddings the sequence is bounded in 
C'"'-topclogy. Then there exists a converging subsequence. 
0 
Now we come to the proposition we aimed at in this section and which 
describes the possible behaviour of sequences of holomorphic curves. 
Proposition 6.45 (Weak compactness) Let I: and M be closed, J a compatible 
almost complex struct-ure on AI, and let fn : :E-> AI, n EN. be a sequence of 
J -holomorphic curves with bounded area: 
a(!, I:)= Lrw:::; A. 
Then there exist finitely many points { x\ ... , x1} in I: and a subsequence of 
{fn} which converges in C 00 -topology on I:\ { x 1, ..• , x1}. 
Proof. We can find a sequence of finite open coverings of I: 
such that 
(i) 
N 3 k ,_, {V;k}iEh: lhl < oo, 
supdiam(V;k)-> 0 
(k-> oc),

6.3 Compactness of tlw Moduli Space 
137 
(ii) there exists a number B, such that for each k the intersection of more 
than B clements of {V;k};Et, is empty. 
(If yon do not believe this, sec remark 6.46). Let c > 0 be the constant given in 
lemma 6...1-! as bound on the area. With the second property we can estimate 
the number of sets in {Vik}iEh satisfying 
(the '·bacr sets). vVe have for all n 
BA ~ cl{i E h I r. J,:w > c}l 
Jv, 
k 
so that the number of bad sets is bounded by a number independent of k and 
n, say by I. vVe construct l sequences of points in L:. indexed by N x N: For 
(n, k) EN x N we choose points 
{ x[n,k)' · · · 'xln,k)} 
in the bad sets Vik, and if we do not have enough bad sets to get l points we 
add arbitrary points to complete. We number these points in arbitrary manner 
and recein~ l sequences. Of these we choose subsequences, i.e. subsequences of 
{fn} and of k >--> {v;k}iEh• such that we may assume that all the sequences 
{ x(n,k)} converge to xi, i = 1, ... , l respectively. 
NmY let K <:;:: L: \ {x1, ... , x1} be a compact set. Because of the first prop-
erty of the sequence of coverings, we can assume for n. k large enough that K 
intersects only sets v;k with fv• f~w :':: c. Then by lemma 6.44 we can extract 
a subsequence of {/n} convergi'ng in C 00-topology on K. 
]\;ow we choose a sequence {Ji,.} mEN of compact sets in L: \ { .r1, ... , x1} 
with 
u Km=L:\{xl, ... ,xl}. 
mEN 
For each m we have a subsequence converging on Km. The diagonal sequence 
then is what we were after. 
0 
Remark 6.46: The sequence of coverings we needed in the proof of proposi-
tion 6.-!5 can be obtained in the following manner: \Ve choose first a smooth 
triangulation of L:. Then we refine this triangulation by dividing in the following 
way 

138 
6 Pseudolwlomorpl1ie Curves 
Thus the number of edges touching a vertex is kept bounded as we go on 
refining. To each vertex we take the open star i.e. the (simplicial) interior of 
all the simplices touching the vertex. This procedure yields the required open 
covering. 
Remark 6.47: Because the compatible metric is a smooth function of the 
compatible almost complex structure, the basic a priori estimate of proposition 
6.42 is uniform in the almost complex structure J. Thus we ha,·e the following 
extension of proposition 6.45 about weak compactness. 
Corollary 6.48 Let {Jn}nEN' ln E .:J(w), be a convergent sequence of com-
patible almost complex structures on the closed symplectic manifold (M,w) and 
let fn : 'E -+ ]}[ be a sequence of ln -holomorphic maps from a closed Riemann 
surface. If JE f~w ::; A < oo then there exists a finite set C C 'E and a subse-
quence of {In} converging in ex-topology on 'E \ C to a curve holomorphic for 
limn-oc ln. 
6.3.4 
Removing singularities 
This section is devoted to prove the following proposition which allows to fill 
in missing points on holomorphic curves as for example the points appearing 
for nonconverging sequences (cf. proposition 6.45 and corollary 6.-!8). 
Proposition 6.49 Let D* = {z E C I 0 < lzl < 1} be the disc without its 
center and let ( 111. w) be a closed symplectic manifold with a compatible almost 
complex structure J (and also the corresponding hermitian metric). A smooth 
J -holomorphic curve f : D* -+ AI with finite area 
a(D*,!) = { 
f*w < oo 
ln• 
has a smooth J -holom orphic extension to all of D = D( 1, 0). 
Proof. We want to apply proposition 6.8 on regularity of weak holomorphic 
curves. But for the moment we do not know if f is regular enough near the 
origin, i.e. the differential should be p-integrable with p > 2 and f should be 
at least continuous at the origin. We note in the following a(U, f) = fu f*w. 
(1) There exists a constant c1 > 0, such that for 0 < r < 1/2 we have 

6.3 Compactnel:is of the 1\Iodu!i Space 
139 
We remark that a(D*, f) < x implies that limr-o l(r) = 0, i.e. the image of 
D* is at worst a thin tube. The apriori estimate of proposition 6.42 gives a 
constant c' such that 
2 
c' 
lzl 
ci 
lldf(z)ll 
~ ( Jf )2 a(D( 2' z), f) ~ lzj2a(D(2Izl, 0). f). 
(6.4) 
Integration yields the estimate above. 
(2) There exists a constant c2 > 0 such that for r sufficiently small: 
To sec this. we inspect what happens to an annulus 
A(r,r') = {z E C lr' ~ lzl ~ r} <;;; D* 
for 0 < r' < r. If r· is sufficiently small, l ( r) will be smaller than the injcctivity 
radius of 11! and we can construct the following map 
cp:Dx[r',r]-----+M, 
which fills the tube f[A(r, r')]: We fiber the disc D by a linear projection along 
a fixed direction. At time t E [r', r] the fiber with endpoints e;", eia' will be 
mapped linearly onto the unique geodesic from f(tei") to f(teia'), where we 
identified 5 1 X [r', r·] with A(r, r') in a standard way. Thus we get by Stokes: 
0 = r 
cp*w = r 
f*w- r 
cp*w + r 
cp*w. 
Ja(Dx[r',r]) 
JA(r,r') 
JDx{r'} 
JDx{r} 
To estimate the last two terms we observe that cp[S 1 x {r}]lics in a geodesic 
ball whose radius is estimated by l(r). By integrating radially in this ball, we 
find a primitive .X for the closed form w whose magnitude can also be estimated 
by l(r). Thus the two terms arc estimated by l(r)2 + l(r')2 . The limit r'-> 0 
gives the desired inequality. 
(3) For ro small enough there exist constants c3, a > 0 such that for 
lzl < ro it is true that 
C3 
lldf(z)il ~ izll-a · 
To see this, we look at the function 
a(r) = a(D(r, 0), f)= { 
f*w = ~ {

iidf(rei"')iidr < oo 
and f is Lipschitz with a global Lipschitz constant. Thus it can be extended 
to a continuous function j : D --> M. Also (3) shows that df E LP for a 
p < l~n > 2, such that J E H1·P(D) for a p > 2. A simple verification with 
the help of cut-off functions shows that j is a weak holomorphic curve and it 
must finaly be smooth by propositon 6.8. 
D 
Now we can look at the result of proposition 6.46 with the help of propo-
sition 6.49. A holomorphic map f : ~ --> JI.I defines a positiYe measure 
C(~) 3 h ,__. aJ(h) = L 
hf*w. 
Because the space of bounded measures is weakly compact, a sequence fk : ~ --> 
M of holomorphic cun·es with bounded area has a subsequence (again called fk) 
which converges uniformly outside a finite set C C ~ to a map /~ : ~ \ C --> J1.I 
and such that the measures a !k converge weakly to some measure >.. The map 
J!x, also has bounded area and can be extended by proposition 6.49 to a map 
foo : ~--> JI.I. For a point z E ~we define 
m(z) = lim lim a(D(t:, z), fk), 
.s-Ok-+oo 
(6.5) 
where we have made a choice of a holomorphic chart around z. Obviously this 
number is well defined and independent of the choice of the chart. For a point

If we remember the model of failure of uniform com·ergcncc of page 126 we 
sec that at a singular point a nonconstant holomorphic sphere splits off and 
we expect that by this process the area of f x may be strictly smaller than the 
limit of a(L:. fk). The missing area should belong to some holomorphic sphere. 
By corollary 6.43 we have a positive gap 
p = min {a( 5 2 , g) I g : 5 2 -> Af holomorphic and non constant}. 
Proposition 6.50 Let fk : I: -> lvf be a sequence of holomorphic curves with 
bounded area prepared as before {i.e. the corresponding measures converge and 
outside C C I: thP- sequence converges locally uniformly to f 00 ). Let the set C

Proof. (i) The set C being minimal, uniform convergence must fail at each 
point z E C. Thus there exists a sequence {zk} with 
• ek = e(fk)(zk) = SUPD(t,z) e(fk) -> oo. 
We renormalize to gk(Y) = fk(e; 112 y + zk) which is defined on the disc

Thus {gk} has a subsequence, again denoted { m:}, which converges locally

A compactness and an existence result 
Iu this section we specialize to 2:: = 5 2 . The Riemann sphere has a large 
automorphism group which tends to inhibit compactness of the moduli space. 
Thus we have to fix three distinct points in 5 2 and avoid that they approach 
in the image. If the energy of the spheres is too small, it is impossible to split 
off a fnrt.hcr sphere. Thus we expect the following proposition to hold. 
Proposition 6.51 Let 5 2 be the Riemann sphere with three distinct points 
s 1,s2,s3 . Let n E Hz(M,Z) be an indivisible class with ([~J.o) < 2R, where 
the constant R should be a lower bound for the energy of all non constant halo· 
m.orphic sphere!! for allw-r:om.patible almost complex structures on Ji!. For a 
positive 15 let 
M~(n) = {(f. J) E M:r(w) (n) I dist(J(si), f(sj)) ;::: 15 for i ;i j} 
(The distance is meas1tred with some fixed auxiliary metric}. Then the projec-
tion 
IT: M:r(w)(n)----> .:J(w) 
gets proper when restricted to M~ ( Ct). 
Proof. Given a converging sequence {Jk} in .:J(w) and a sequence {(fk, Jk)} in 
M~(et) we may assume thct there arc finitely many points {z1 , ... ,z1} C 5 2 
such that {Jk} com·ergcs uniformly on compact sets in 5 2 \ { z 1 .... , z1} to a 
map f x 
: 5 2 ---+ JU and such that we have the relation

with m(z;) 2: PJ 2: R (sec proposition 6.50). Thus I ::; 1 and at least two 
of the points s 1 , s 2 , s3 arc not in { z 1, ... , z1}. Thus f x. is not constant and 
a(52,fx) 2: R. Hence l = 0. 
o 
Let us consider the following situation. By X we denote a closeJ. symplectic 
manifold with symplectic structure wx. Let 5 2 be the Riemann sphere with its 
standard symplectic structure w5 2 with volume 47f. On the product manifold 
1\1 = 5 2 x X we have the symplectic structure wo = "''S2 g wx. The smn of the 
standard almost complex structure of 5 2 and a wx-compatihle structure Jx 
gives a wa-compatible structure Jo = J5 , EB Jx. Let o =[52 ] x 1 E H2(M, Z). 
Then the set of Jo-holomorphic spheres in the class o arc the comp0sitions 
with an arbitrary point x E X. (The projection of a Jo-holomorphic sphere 
on the second factor is again a holomorphic sphere. but with trivial homology 
class, so that it must be constant). Thus we have dimMJ0 (o) =dim X+ 6. 
On the other hand the index of the relevant D-oper a tor is

Consequently, the structure Jo is regular (sec page 117). 
If we choose a point s 1 E 5 2 we have the smooth evaluation map 
f >--> f(st). 
This map is surjective. 
Proposition 6.52 In the situation we have described, let J be an arbitrary 
wa-compatible almost complex structure on !JI = 5 2 x X. If we assume that 
the integral of wx vanishes on spherical classes, then the evaluation map eJ : 
MJ(o:)-> M is surjective. 
Proof. Let us first assume that J is a regular structure. Then we have by 
proposition 6.27 a path 1: I-> J(w) such that 
M-y(n) = { (!, t) I f. [52] = o:, f is 1(t)-holomorphic} 
is a manifold with boundary 
Let us choose two further points s2, s3 E 5 2 and let 
L;={s;}xx6M (i=1,2,3) 

144 
6 Pseudolwlonwrp!Jic Curves 
be the injection~. Then we can find arbitrarily small C 1-perturbations Ji which 
arc transver~al to the evaluation map r, : M,(n) -> 11!. Thus 
M,(n) = {(f,t) E M'l(n) I f(-9;) E L,. i = 1.2.3} 
is a manifold with boundary 
M.t.,(n) U M.t(n). 
Kow we have 
If the perturbations of the j; 's arc small enough there exists a b > 0 ~uch that 
for all (.f. t) E M 1 (n) 
dist(J(.s;), f(.sj)) 2 b fori i j. 
Now we observe that w<~ can take R = 471' and with proposition 6.51 the man-
ifold M,(n) is compact and M1.,(n), M.J(u) are (nonoriented) cobordant. 
The evaluation map P.10 has nontrivial degree, hence also C.t and it must also 
he surjective (if you do not believ<~ thi~, look at remark 6 .. 53). 
='low let J he any compatible structure on 11! and let p E _\f be an arbitrary 
point. Then we may approximate J by regular structures .h -> .1. For b > 0 
is proper and over each A there is a j., such that fk ( .s r) = p. Then there exists 
a subseque!'ce fk"' converging in M~(n) to (J, .1) and obviously f(sr) = p. D 
Remark 6.53: A clo~ed manifold y(n) has a fundamental class [Y] which 
is the generator of H,(Y; Z2) = Z2, and the localization map H,(Y; Z2) -> 
Hn(Y, Y \ {p}; Z2) is an i~omorphism for each point p. A map J: z<nl _, y(n) 
between dosed manifold:; of equal dimension such that the point p is not in the 
image: f[Z] c Y \ {p} ha~ j. [Z]i(Y,Y -p)= 0. Thus also j. [Z] = 0 E H,(Y; Z2). 
This shows that a map of degree 1 must be surjective. 
A compact manifold with boundary (z(n+I), DZ) has a fundamental class 
in H,+ 1 (Z, DZ: Z2) = Z2. Via the boundary operator D : H,+ 1 (Z, DZ) ~ 
Hn(DZ), this yields the fundamental class of the boundary manifold. A map 
f: (Z, DZ) -> Y satisfies j. [8Z] = 0 E Hn(Y; Z2), because one lms the factor-
ization 
Hn+I(Z,DZ)

This shows that tlw two boundary components in the proof of proposition 6.52 
give the same homology class under the evaluation map. The standard reference 
for these kinds of things is of course chap. 6.3 of [97].

An application 
Iu this section we shall prove a theorem of Gramm· which states that a ball in 
R 2" cannot he squeezed in certain directions by a symplectic diffeomorphism. 
(For another proof using symplectic capacities sec section 4.2.) Let R 2 " be 
equipped with the standard symplectic structure w which is described relative 
to the standard basis by w( e2i-l, e2j) = {jiJ. 
Proposition 6.54 We consider an open set U ~ D(R.O) x R2n- 2 ~ R 2" and 
a symplectic dijjeomo1·phism U.::::, B,. with an open ball in R 2". Then R ~ r. 
Pmof. First we remark that we can embed (by an elementary formula) the disc 
D(R, 0) symplectically as 5 2 \ { oo} into the sphere with the homogeneous sym-
plectic form of volume 1r R2 on 5 2 . If we denote by cp : B , . .::::, U the symplectic 
diffeomorphism of the hypothesis, for every b > 0 the ball B,._6 is mapped onto 
a bounded set in D(R,O) X R 2"-2 . Hence we Call embed v6 = cp[Br-6(0)] into 
a symplectic manifold of the form 
AI= 5 2 X T, 
when• T is a compact standard torus with its symplectic form. On l 76 we have 
the almost complex structure coming from the standard structure on B,. ~ R 2". 
It is obviously compatible with the symplectic form on AI. But remember that 
a compatible almost complex structure can be identified with a smooth section 
of a vector bundle (sec corollary 6.5). Thus we can extend the almost complex 
structure given on V6 to the whole of AI without changing it on V26· Now 
we can apply proposition 6.52 because rr2(T) = 0 and we get a holomorphic 
sphere passing through the image of the center of B,. and whose homology class 
is [52] x 1 such that its area must be 1r R2 • The part of this sphere inside of 
V26 can be pulled back with <p, and we !!;et a holomorphic curve inside Br-26 
passing through the center and of area :-::; 7r R 2 . But by an inequality on complex 
subvarieties of dimension 1 in a ball, its volume must be larger than rr(r- 28)2 • 
Thus r - 28 :-::; R for all 8 > 0. 
0 
This result immediately implies that a product of two open discs D(r1, 0) x 
D ( r~, 0) can be diffeomorphic to another such product D ( r2, 0) x D ( r~, 0) by 
a symplectic map if and only if { r 1, ri} = { r2, r~}. 
First the two volumes must be equal, i.e. r 1ri = r2 r~. Then if r 1 :-::; r~ we have 
the ball Br, C D(r,,O) x D(ri,O) such that the last proposition implies that 
r, :::; min(r2. r~) = r2, say. By symmetry r, = r2 and we are clone. 
This is of course only the beginning of the whole story. But here we aban-
don the patient reader and hope that he returns with more courage to the work 
of GromoY [50] or to more recent applications as in [73] and [74].

Gromov's Compactness Theorem from 
a Geometrical Point of View 
As a complement to the chapter on pseucloholmorphic curve:; we draw now our 
attention to the original proof of Gromov 's cornpactne:;:; theorem [50]. Pansu 
was the first to shed light on the ideas of this proof in his prcprint [85]. Re-
cently all the details have been worked out carefully by Hummel [61], who:;c 
"Diplomarheit" is the main reference for this chapter. 
The real advantage of this approach is its geometrical intuition and its 
analogy to the holomorphic theory which occurs on different occasion:;: in fact, 
pseudoholomorphic versions of the Schwarz Lemma. of the vVeierstrass The-
orem and of a well known monotonicity property will prove to he extremdy 
important tools. One further example of a classical result generalized for pseu-
doholornorphic rrmps is a theorem on removing singularities similar to propo-
sition 6.49. On the other hand, Hunuucl investigates a very delicate notion of 
convergence. which is closely related to com·ergencc of hyperbolic structures 
on Riemann surfaces, using elementary coordinates on the Riemann moduli 
space, the Fcnchel-Niclsen parameters. So the geometrical aspects of pscudo-
holomorphic curves and of Gromov's compactness re:;ult arc imleed illuminated 
by analog:• with classical facts. 
It i:; not onr intention to reproduce all the dC'taib of Pansu's and Hummel's 
work. On the contrary. most of the tools mentioned above, important m; they 
arc, arc just quoted without proofs. However, as an alternative to some of 
the results stated in Chapter 6, we try at least to present the main ideas and 
stC'ps in Gromov"s original approach. J\Ioreovcr the interested reader will find 
an cxtcnsiw pre:;entation of the subject in [61] and [85]. 
Chapter 7 is divided into three sections: in the first one we recall some 
definitions and formulate a number of important properties of pseudoholomor-
phic curws. The second section treats Riemann surfacC's and their deformation 
and introduces the notion of cusp-curves. The third SC'ction is entirely devotC'cl 
to Gromm··s compactness theorem and its proof. 
7.1 
Gromov-Schwarz Lemma, Monotonicity, 
Removing Singularities 
Definition 7.1 Let (N,j) and (M, J) be almost complex manifolds. A ex_ 
map f: (X.j)-+ (M,J) is called (j,J)-holomorphic (or simply pseudoholo-
morphic). if it is complex linear, i.e. 
df 0 j = J 0 df. 
For the special case where f is a pseudoholomorphic map defined on a closed 
Riemann surface (S,j) we introduce the term J-holomorphic {or pseudoholo-
morphic) curve. In this case j denotes the usual complex structure on the Rie-

148 
7 Gronw\··s Compactness Theorem from a Geometrical Point of View 
mann surface S. By analogy a J -holomorphic curve with boundary is given by 
a pseudoholomorphic map defined on a Riemann surface with boundary. 
Remember that a Hermitian metric /L on an almost complex manifold 
(1\J, J) is defined as a Riemannian metric which is ./-invariant: 
!t(u, v) = ft(.lu, Jv) 
(Vu, v E TpM;p E .U). 
(,\{, .J, ft) then denotes a Hermitian manifold. A first crucial result due to Gro-
mov is a generalization of the classical Schwarz lemma: 
Lemma 7.2 {Gromov-Schwarz} [61, p. 13] Let (M, .!, !L) be a compact Hermi-
tian manifold. Then there exist constants co > 0 and c > 0 with the following 
properties: If g is a .! -holornorphic map g : D --> AI defined on the open unit 
disc D <:;; C such that the image g(D) is contained in some Eo-ball B,0 <:;; 1\I, 
then the norm of the differential of g at the origin is bounded by c: 1\dgoll <c. 
A proof of this lemma is presented in all the detaib in [61. 1.4]; the ideas 
go back to Gromov [50] and Pansu [85]. 
We should mention that D, as an open subset of C, inherits the standard 
complex structure j and the Hermitian metric v from the complex plane. The 
(j, J)-holomorphic map g : D --> M is conformal. Indeed. if L' E TS, then 
v(v,jv) = 0 = !t(dg(v), .ldg(v)) = g*fL(v,jv) and g*p(r. e) = g*p(jv,jv). 
Therefore g* /L = l\dg\\ 2v. Here lldgll denotes the norm of dg with respect to the 
Hermitmn metrics v and ft. 
The conformality of g is an important property used in the proof of the 
Gromov-Schwarz lemma. Another fact which enters into the proof is the area 
minimizing property of pseudoholomorphic curves. Let us be more precise: The 
area of an immersion f : S--> (1\f, J, /L) is defined by 
Area(!) := is a 
f' w 
a f' I' is the volume element on S with respect to f* /L· Iff is pseudoholomorphic, 
then, given a Hermitian metric h on the Riemann surfaceS. the area coincides 
with the energy 
E(J) := is!ldfll2ah, 
(where ah is the volume form with respect to h). 
The following estimate 
Area(!) ?: is f*w, 
an immediate consequence of the Wirtinger inequality formulated in the second 
chapter1, is true for every differentiable map f: (S,h)--> (M,.l,fl), provided 
1 In the special case in question, the Wirtinger inequality follows easily from the fact that 
w(v,w) :<::: 1 for any two orthonormal v,w E T'A/, with equality iff w = Jv. 

7.1 Gromov-Schwarz Lemma, Monotonicity, Remo\·ing Singularities 
14!) 
w(·, ·) := p(J·, ·) defines a compatible symplectic structure (remember defini-
tion 6.1) on (!If, J, Jt). Equality holds if and only iff is J-holomorphic. So a 
pscudoholomorphic curve is area minimizing in its homology class in H 2(lll, R). 
In addition. if U C M is an open subset with the property that wlu is exact. 
then a .J-holomorphic curve f : S --+ U with boudary in U is area minimizing 
among all the differentiable maps <.p: S --+ U with -Pios = !IDs· 
The idea of the proof of the Gromov-Sehwarz lemma now is first to derive 
in several steps a sort of isopcrimctrical relation in analogy with the Euclidean 
case, where area minimizing maps of surfaces with boundary satisfy such an 
isoperimctric inequality. By the way, as a corollary of one of these steps one 
gets the monotonicity of pscudoholomorphic curves formulated in the lemma 
below. As regards the proof of the Gromov-Schwarz lemma., it is not hard to 
bring it to an end: from the isoperimctric inequality the boundcdness of the 
norm of dgo is easily derived. 
Lemma 7.3 {Monotonicity) [61, p. 19] Let(,\!. J.Jl) be a compact Hermitian 
manifold. Then ther·e exist constants Eo, C AIL > 0 with the following properties: 
Iff : (S. j) --+ (M, .J, Jl) is a J -holomorphic CUTI'e with boundary, So E s \as 
andrE (O . .oo) such that j(fJS) lies outside of a closed r-ball B,.(f(so)) <;;; lll, 
then the following inequality holds 
Arca(f(S) n Br(f(.~o))) 2 C.uL · r 2 • 
We often usc the notation Area.(J(S)nU) instead of Area(Jit-'(U)), where 
U is an open subset of lll. 
As mentioned above, this result already appears in the proof of the Gro-
mov-Schwarz lemma and it is of course not by accident that similar properties 
show up in the theory of minimal surfaces. In the domain of pscucloholomorphic 
curves the monotonicity in fact turns out to be an efficient result, as we will 
sec in the third section, when we prove Gromov's compactness theorem. 
vVc proceed with a theorem on removing singularities and with a conver-
gence result. In both cases the rcacler will recognize the similarity to well known 
facts in classical function theory. 
Theorem 7.4 {Removing Singularities) [61, p. 30] Let S be a Riemann sur-
face and (JI, J, Jl) a Hermitian manifold. Given a J -holomorphic map f : 
S \ {a} --+ JU (where a E S is an inner point of S ), whose image is rela-
tively compact, suppose that there exists a neighbourhood G of a in S such that 
JIG\{a} has finite area. Then f extends to a J -holomorphic map defined on the 
whole surface S. 
This is a variant of Proposition 6.4!). The proof suggested by [61] and [85] 
uses the fact that, roughly speaking, the differentials of pscucloholomorphic 
maps are again pscudoholomorphic. The same argument is needed to prove a 
generalized version of the Weierstrass Theorem. 

150 
7 Gromov·s Compactness Theorem from a Geometrical Point of View 
Theorem 7.5 (Generalized Weierstrass Theorem) [61, p. 4.5] Let (jn)n~l be 
a sequence of campier structures on a compact connected surface S which con-
verges in the ex-topology to a complex structure j on S and let Unln>! be a 
sequence of (jn, J)-holomorphic maps fn : S --> (M, J, p). Then the following 
holds: If Unln~! com·erges to a map f: s __, (M, J, p) in the C 0 -topology, then 
it convergences in the C:x,-topology and moreover f is (j, J)-holomorphic. 
By Ck-topology we mean the weak Ck-topology, in other word~, the topol-
ogy of locally uniform ck-convcrgcncc (0 ::; k < 00 ). 
7.2 
Deformation of Surfaces and Convergence 
of Hyperbolic Structures 
We begin this section with a summary of some definitions and classical facts 
about Riemann surfaces. Let S be a Riemann surface. By the uniformization 
theorem, its universal covering surface S is conformally equivalent to C, C or 
H := {z E C: Imz > 0}. The covering group r is a discrete group of l\16bius 
transformations acting freely on S. S is then conformally equivalent to S jf. 
Note that if the uni\'('rsal covering is the upper halfplanc H. then a complete 
Hermitian metric with constant curvature -1 is induced on S. the Poincare 
metric. 
We arc mainly interested in hyperbolic surfaces. These arc connected 
oriented Riemann surfaces which arc equipped with the Poincare metric h and 
which have finite volume. Moreover the boundary components arc supposed to 
be simple closed geodesics (with respect to h). The signature (g, m, k) of such 
a hyperbolic surface S is defined by its genus g, by the number m of bound-
ary components and by the number k of punctures. If the Euler characteristic 
2g- 2 + m + k is positive, then the volume of Sis 2n(2g- 2 + m + k). 
The Riemann moduli space )R(g,m,k) is the space of equivalence classes of 
conformally equivalent Riemann surfaces with signature (g, m, k ). If 2g-2+m+ 
k > 0, then a parametrization of )R(g,m,k) (which by the way is the quotient of 
the Teichmiiller space Tr,9 ,m,k) with the corresponding modular group) is given 
by the Fenchel-Niclsen coordinates. These parameters are deduced from the 
pants decomposition of the given hyperbolic surface. 
Pants Decomposition 
How does this decomposition look like? A pair of pants is a hyperbolic surface 
with signature (0, 3. 0). Let us point out that the conformal equivalence class of 
a pair of pants Y is uniquely determined by the lengths ( l ( 'Yl), l ( 'Y2), l ( 'Y3)) of its 
boundary components ·n, 'Y2, 'Y3. If one or more boundary components degener-
ate to a puncture, then we get a hyperbolic surface of signature (0, 2, 1), (0, 1, 2) 
or (0, 0, 3). In such a case we use the term "degenerate pair of pants". We set 
l('Y) := 0, if 'Y is a degenerate boundary component, i.e. a puncture. Observe 

7.2 Deformation of Surfaces and Convergence of Hyperbolic Structures 
151 
that on every non-degenerate boundary component li (i = 1, 2, 3) there is a 
distinguished point, namely the initial point of the shortest geodesic which 
connects 'Yi with 'Yi-1 (set 'Yo= "13)· 
Now, given a hyperbolic surfaceS with signature (g, m, k), there arc r := 
3g- 3 + m + k simple closed and pairwise disjoint geodesics 'Yl, ... , 'Yr such that 
S \ ( 'Yl U ... U 'Yr) consists of N := 2g - 2 + m + k pairs of pants. Taking into 
account a marking of the surface S (this is a minimal ordered set of clements 
generating the fundamental group 1r1 (S) of S), the r geodesics and the resulting 
pants decomposition of S arc uniquely determined. (Xotc that pairs of pants 
arc themselves marked by the numeration of their boundary components.) 
The Fenchcl-Nielscn parameters of S arc now giwn by 
(I( "'I), ... , l('Yr))

that there arc indeed two distinguished points on "f;: one from each of the two

uniqncly determines a marked hyperbolic surface S: S can be constructed by 
glueing together 2g - 2 + m + k pairs of pants; the glueing data are provided 
by the Fenchel-Nielsen parameters. 
In summary, there is a one-one relation between R(g,m,k) and the (6g -
6 +3m+ 2k)-dimensional space R~+m x [0, 1)" given by the Fenchel-Nielsen 
coordinates. 
Convergence of Hyperbolic Structures 
We deal now with the convergence problem of hyperbolic structures on a surface 
S with a given signature, in other words: we are interested in convergence within 
the Riemann moduli space and especially at its boundary, as we will see. More 
about these questions can be found in the standard literature of Teichmiiller 
theory ([1]. for instance). 
Let us consider a sequence (S~)n2::l of marked hyperbolic surfaces, all 
of the same signature (g,m,k). We assume that the lengths of all the closed 
geodesics on S~ which are not boundary components are bounded from below, 
independently of n, by c > 0. Moreover the lengths of the boundary components 
of s~ should be bounded from above, again independently of n. 
In view of the marking, there is a uniquely determined decomposition of 
S~ into pairs of pants Y;, ... , Y,{" 
(N = 2g- 2 + m + k) for all n ~ 1. By a 
theorem of Bers (see [1, p. 98]) we can assume without loss of generality that 

152

the length of all the boundary components of all the pairs of pants arc hounded 
from above by a constant independent of n.

with r = 3g - 3 + m + k. The boundedness of all the parameters enables us 
to take a subsequence of (S;,)n2:b again denoted by (S;,),.2:1· such that the 
parameters converge for n --+ oo, i.e. 
for i = 1, ... , r and j = 1, ... , m. Let k' be the number of Lj which arc 
equal to zero. (l;)i=l. ... ,,., (Lj)j=i, ... ,m and (a;)i=l, ... ,r arc the Fcnchcl-Niclscn 
coordinates of a uniquely determined hyperbolic surface S* with signature 
(g,m- k', k + k'). 
Let Sn and S be the one-point compactifications at the punctures of s;, 
and S*, respectively. After some reordering we can usc the following notation: 
• "! ,~, ... , 1;;• for the non-degenerate boundary components of s:, 
• 1;;•+1 , ... , 1;;•H for the degenerate boundary components of s:, 
• 'Yrn+ 1, ... , 'Ym+k and, in addition, 1 1, ... , 'Yk' for the degenerate boundary 
components of s· 
• 'Yk' + 1, ... '1 Til for the non-degenerate boundary components of s· 
Proposition 7.6 ([61, III.3.1]) There is a sequence of continuous maps 'Pn 
Sn --> S with the following properties: 
1. 'Pnh~)="f;fori=1, ... ,m+k 
2. 'Pnls.\Uh;,:i=l.. .. ,k'} is a diffeomorphism onto its image. Its inverse we 
denote by 1/.•, : S \Ubi : i = 1, ... k'} ---> Sn \ Uh~ : i = 1. ... , k'} 
3. 1/.Jn enables us to pull back the hyperbolic structure h,. of s:, to a Rieman-
nian metric u:,hn on S*. Then (1/J:,hn)n2: 1 converges to the hyperbolic 
structure h on s· in the C 00 -topology. 
4. For the complex structure Jn of Sn we have a similar result: (1/J.:,jn)n2:1 
converges in the C00 -topology to the complex structure j on S restricted 
to S \ Ub; : i = 1, ... , k'}. 

7.2 Deformation of Surfaces and Convergence of Hyperbolic Structures 
153 
For the proof we refer to [61]. The idea is to reduce the statements to pairs 
of pants. Then one has to solve some convergence problems for hexagons in the 
universal covering space using hyperbolic geometry. Similar techniques occur 
for example in [37]. 
Deformations and Cusp-Curves 
\Ve arc going to consider deformations of surfaces and we will introduce the 
notion of cusp-curves, in other words we arrive at another central point of this 
section. 
Let S be a closed surface and (ri)iEI a finite family of simple, closed and 
pairwise disjoint curves inS. Then S\U{ 'Yi : i E I} consists of a finite number of 
components, each being homeomorphic to a closed surface from which a certain 
finite number of points have been deleted. S is now defined as the surface we 
get from S \ Ubi : i E I} by one-point compactification. Corresponding to 
every -,; E S, there arc two points s; and s;' in S, possibly lying in different 
components of S. We now identify s; and s;' (Vi E I) and get a new topological 
space S in this way. Intuitively, we get S from S by shrinking each curve "(; to 
a point. Let a : S --> S denote the canonical projection. 8; := a(s:J = a(s:') 
are called singular points of the singular surface S, 
si(S) := {singular points of S }. 
Note that als\{s;,s;': iEI} is a diffeomorphism onto its image. Given a closed 
surfaceS. we shall always denote the corresponding singular surface by S. Sis 
t:w disjoint union of the components of S. 
Definition 7. 7 A deformation of a surface S into a singular surface S lS a 
continuous surjective map 'P : S --> S with the following properties: 
1. The preimage <p- 1({s}) of every singular point .5 E si(S) is a simple 
closed curve in S. 
2. 'Pis\.,o--'(si(S)) is a diffeomorphism onto S\si(S). Its inverse we denote by 
'lj;: S\si(S) __, s \ 'P- 1(si(S)). 
It is time to present the definition of cusp-curves. a generalization of pseu-
doholomorphic curves. (Every J-holomorphic curve is a cusp-curve.) 
Definition 7.8 A complex structure I on a singular surface S is a complex 
structure on S. We call (S,J) a singular Riemann surface or a Riemann surface 
with singular points. A continous map J: (S, I) --+ (M. J) (where (M, J) is an 
almost complex manifold} is called J-holomorphic, if J o a is J -holomorphic. 
Then J is called a cusp-curve in M. Area(/) := Area(/ o a) is the area of the 
cusp-curve f.

7 Gromov's Compactness Theorem from a Geometrical Point of View 
\Vc will sec in section 7.3 that under certain circumstances there is a 
compactification of the space of pseudoholomorphic curves hy means of cusp-
curves. We close this section with some remarks about the 
Thick-Thin Decomposition of Hyperbolic Surfaces 
LPt us first have a look at annuli. It is a well known fact that each annulus A 
is cunfonnally equivalent 
a) either to the elliptic cylinder C/Z 
(~ S 1 x R ~ C \ {0}) 
b) or to the parabolic cylinder H/(P) 
(~ S1 x (0, oc) ~ D \ {0} ), where Pis 
the standard parabolic transformation in PSL(2,R); P: z ,__. z + 1. (P) is the 
cyclic group generated by P. 
c) or to exactly one of the hyperbolic cylinders H/ (11) with l > 0, where 11 is 
a standard hyperbolic transformation in PSL(2,R).11: z ,__. e1::: 
(l > 0). We 
have H/(11) ~ S 1 x (O,r) with r = 272 > 0. 
In the two hyperbolic cases band c the modulus of the annulus A is defined 
by ~IodA := oc and ModA := r, respectively. (For details consult [16]). 
Definition 7.9 Given a hyperbolic 8urface S = H/f, the injcctivity radius of 
S at a point z E Sis defined by injrad{S, z) := ! inf-yEf\{irl} d(z.')(z)), where 
d is the hype1·bolic metric. 
The thick-thin decomposition of a hyperbolic surface describes the {thin) 
components with small injcctivity radius. The thick components arc those with 
large injcctivity radius. For details we recommend [16]. 
Theorem 7.10 {Thick-Thin Decomposition) 
Let S be a hyperbolic surface 
and U <;;;Sa connected component of{s E S: injrad(S,s) < 1}. Then one of 
the following statements is true: 
1. either U contains a simple closed geodesic "! of S with length l ("!) < 
2 arsinh1 and is isometric to 
{wE Hj(T1): injrad{H/('Il),w) < arsinh1} 
2. or U is isometric to 
{ w E H/ (P) : injrad{H/ (P), w) < arsinh1} 
The thick-thin decomposition will prove to be a useful tool in the proof of 
Gromov's compactness theorem. 

7.3 Gromov's Compactness Theorem 
155 
7.3 
Gromov's Compactness Theorem 
\Vc start with the central notion of convergence. 
Definition 7.11 Let (AI, J, p) be a Hermitian manifold, S a closl'd snrface 
and (j,.)n21 a sequence of complex stmctures on S. Suppose that fn: (S,jn) _, 
(M, J, fl) is a sequence of(jn, J)-holomorphic curves in M. We say that Un)n> 1 
converges to a cusp-curve 1 : ( 5, j) --> ( M, J, Jl) if the following conditions hold: 
1. For each n 2: 1 there exists a deformation :;,. : S --> 5 such that ( <p;,- 1 )* j,. 
converges to Jls\si(S) in the C""'-topology. 
2. (!,. o <p;,- 1 )n21 converges to 11s\si(S) in the ex -topology. 
3. lim,.~x Area(!,.) = Area(]). 
Remark: If f,. converges to a cusp-curve 1 as described above, then 1 is 
independent of the parametrization. To be more precise: if Xn : (S,j,.) ---> (S, j,.) 
are conformal maps (for n 2: 1), then Uno Xn)n>1 converges to the same 1 as 
(!,.),.>1· The parametrization of 1 is not unique -;;ither. But one can show that 
if 1 a~d j are two different limits of the same sequence, then their images in 
(AI, J, p) agree. 
\Vc arc now ready to state Gromov's compactness theorem [50] for pscu-
doholomorphic curves. 
Theorem 7.12 (Gmmov's Compactness Theorem) [61, p. 66] Let (M, J, p) be 
c1 compact Hermitian manifold, S a closed snrface and (j,.),.2 1 a sequence of 
complex stmctures on S. Assume that fn : (S. j,.) --> (AI, J, p) is a sequence 
of Un· J)-holomorphic curves in (M, J, p) with Arca(Jn) ::; C for a constant C 
independent of n. Then the·re is a subsequence of (J,.)n>1, which converges to 
a cusp-curve 1: (5,}) ---> (M, J, p). 
-
Remark: If in addition (M, J, p) is endowed with a symplectic structure w such 
that J is compatible with w (see definition 6.1). then the condition Area(!,.)::; 
C (Vn 2: 1) is fulfilled provided that (!,.),.>1 is a sequence of J-holomorphic 
curves f n : ( S, Jn) ---> ( M, J, Jl) in a fixed ho;;-wlogy class. 
Proof of the Compactness Theorem 
We reproduce the proof given by [61], which works out the ideas of [85]. Given 
a compact Hermitian manifold (M, J, p,), we can choose co E (0, injrad(i\I)) 
such that the conditions of the Gromov-Schwarz lemma as well as the con-
ditions of the monotonicity lemma hold. Let us start with the investigation 
of J-holomorphic curves f : (S,j) ---> (M,J.p,) whose area is bounded by a 
constant: Area(!) ::; C. 

156 
7 Grom01-".s Compactness Theorem fi-om a Geometrical Point of View 
Lemma 7.13 (Rescaling) [61, p. 67] Iff: S---> ]If is a J-holomorphic curve 
in M with Area(!) ::; C, then there exist a universally bounded n1tmber of 
points s 1, ... , sk and a 1tniversal constant Po > 0 such that. with respect to the 
Poincare metric h on S* := S \ { s1, ... , .5k}, every p0 -bull in (S'. h) is mapped 
into an appropriate <::o-ball in M. 
Remark: By a universal constant we mean in this section a constant which de-
pends at most on (J/ . .J, Jl), Eo and C. Universally bounded stands for bounded 
by a universal constant. 
Pmof of Lemma 7.13. Without loss of generality we may assume that f : 
S ---> M is not a constant map. Given s E S we define U(s) as the connected 
component of f- 1(B,0 ; 18(/(s))) inS which contains s. 
First step: An estimation for Area(!!~). One has to check that DU(s) # 0 
for the topological boundary DU(s) = U(s) \ U(s). This is indeed true, 
because we ran assume without loss of generality ([6L lemma 1.6.1]) that 
there is no J-holomorphic curve in A/ whose image is completely con-
tained in a single Eo-ball in AI. For topological reasons we have then 
f(DU(s)) <;;; &B<o/18(/(s)). 
Apply now the monotonicity lemma to flu(.,) : U(s)......, M: 
( -
--
)

Eo 2 
Area(!!~) 2: Area f(U(s)) n B~e:o; 18 (/(s)) 2: Cm(2 · 18 ) · 
Note that f(8U(s)) n B~<o/ 18 (/(s)) = 0. 
Second step: We have to choose a discrete set of points F C S with the pro-
perty that U(sJ)nU(s2) = 0 for all s1, s2 E F. Because of Area(!lu(s)) 2: 
C AIL ( ~ f~Y the number of points in F is universally bounded: 
#F <

Area(!lu(s)) -
c!I!L 
Eo 
Therefore let us choose the set F with maximal number of points. The 
consequence is: To each s E S there exists a point s' E F with U(s) n 
U(s') # 0. 
Third step: Note that #F is certainly greater than 2. The reason is again 
that the image of f is not contained in a single Eo-ball. So it is possible 
to endow S* := S \ F with the Poincare metric h. 
Fourth step: Let A. <;;; S* be an embedded closed annulus in S*. Given s E A, 
there are two possibilities: 

7.3 Gromm··s Compactness Theorem 
157 
1. F(s) rf= A\ DA. Then it is obvious that d(f(s). f(DA)) < ~ < 7f-. 
2. U(s) <:;: A \DA. Because of the ma .. ximality ofF it is possible to choose 
some so E F such that U(so) n U(s) f= 0. so rf:. A as A c S* = S \F. 
Therefore we find some s' E U(s0 ) n DA with 
d(J(s), f(DA)) 
::; 
d(f(s), f(.s')) 
::; 
d(f(s), f(so)) + d(f(so), f(s')) 
< 
From 1 and 2 we conclude 
d(J(s), f(DA)) < ~ (Vs E A) 
and 
""o 
d(J(DoA), f(81A)) < T· 
where Do A and D1 A arc the two boundary components of the annulus A. 
Last step: We finish the proof of Lemma 7.13 by means of the following result: 
Lemma 7.14 (61, p. 69] 
There is a universal con.5tant Po > 0 such that 
every Po -ball in ( S*, h) is contained in an annulus A ernbeded in S* with 
the property: l(Jia,A) ::; 7f- for both boundary components DoA and 81A 
of A. 
This lemma guarantees in our situation the existence of a universal con-
stant Po > 0 with the following property: Given a po-ball Bp0 (s*) C 
(S*. h). there is a embedded closed annulus A C S* with l(Jia,A) ::; 
7f-
(i = 0, 1). Then for any s, s' E A we hm·e 
d(J(s), f(s')) 
::; 
d(J(s), f(DA)) + 1(/la., . .J.) + l(Jia 1A) 
+ d(J(DoA), f(DIA)) + d(J(DA), f(s')) 
Eo 
Eo 
Eo 
~o 
Eo 
6 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 6 =Eo. 
Immediately we conclude that the diameter of f(A) is less than co, and 
the diameter of f ( B Po ( s*)) is even smaller. 
D 
Proof of Lemma 7.14. We begin with some preliminaries: First, if <p : S x 
(0, T) ..... JI is a J-holomorphic map of the hyperbolic annulus 5 1 x (0, T) with 
modulus T < oo into !vi, then we are able to estimate the area of <pin the usual 
way

Second. let us choo~c Po > 0 small enough such that the following conditions 
arc fulfilled: 
(a) 3po < ,fiiO 
(b) log( tanh 1,") - log( tanh ~) 2: 36 · ~ 
{) 
(c) r := 2 ,fiiO + Po < arsinh1 and sir;hr - 1 2: 36 · ~. As a consequence we 
have: if injrad(S*. s) < 2,/fio, then injrad(S*, ·)1 8 ,,0 (.•) < r < arsinhl. 
Note that po only depend~ on (M . .!.11), Eo and C. Given any po-ball Bp0 (s) 
inS*, the main idea of the proof is to construct three annuli .40 . .4' . .41 embed-
ded in (S*,h) with moduli 1\IodAo,:\IodA',l\IodAt and the following proper-
tics: 
1. Bp0 (s)<;;;A' 
2 . .4' is closed. Ao and A1 arc half-open 
3. The three annuli are lying one in another, i.e. there arc conformal trans-
formations

(for i = 0, 1). 
Once such annuli have been constructed, the proof is easily finished: In-
deed, using (7.1) we find to E (0, l\IodAo] and t1 E [ModA' + :\IodAo, ModA' + 
1\IodAo +ModAl) such that

(for the second inequality we used 4 and the condition Area(!) :<:: C). Set 
A:= <p(S1 x [to. t 1]). Then Bp0 (s) <;;;A'<;;; A and A is the annulus oflemma 7.14. 
But now the question is: How do we construct the three annuli Ao, A', A1? 
In this situation the thick-thin decomposition proves to be Yery helpful. Let us 
distinguish whether s E S* (the center of the given p0-ball) lies in a thick or in 
a thin component of ( S*, h). 

7.3 Gromo\·'s Compactness Theorem

(the last inequality holds because of condition (b)). Therefore 4 holds, 
too. 
Case 2: injracl(S', s) < 2.Jri0. Condition (c) and the theorem about the thick-
thin decomposition enables us to find a neighbourhood U of the p0-ball 
in BPo (s) in S' such that 
• either U is isometric to 
{wE H/(Tz): injrad(H/(Tt),w) < arsinh1} 
(for some l < 2r), 
• or U is isometric to {wE H/(P): injrad(H/(P),w) < arsinh1}. 
So. U can be identified with the corresponding subset of the hyperbolic 
cylinder H/ (Tt) or the parabolic cylinder H/ (P) . 
In the hyperbolic case let us define A0 and A 1 to be the two connected 
components of the subset 
{wE H/(Tt): r-:;: injrad(H/(Tt),u·) < arsinh1} s;; U 
and A' the subset lying between them 
A' = {rc E H/ (Tt) : injrad(H/ (I/). u·) -:;: r} s;; U.

Corollary 7.15 For a J -holornorphic curve f : S--> M with Area(!) ::; C the 
differential df on S* is universally bounded with respect to the Poincare metric. 
Proof. Given s E S*. Let p : (D, A) --> S* be the universal covering of S* with 
p(O) = s. Here D is the unit disc with Poincare metric A. By lemma 7.13 the 
image of Bp0 (0) ~ (D, A) under f o p i;; contained in an appropriate co-ball 
in (./If, J, ft). Using the Gromov-Schwarz lemma the norm of d(f o p) at the 
point 0 can be estimated by a universal constant. Therefore lldfs II is universally 
bounded as well.

\Ve start now \Yith the proof of the compactness theorem: 
Choice of a Subsequence 
Assume that S b a closed Riemann surface of genus g and (j,.)o>t a sequence 
of complex structures on S. Let S,. denote the Riemann surfac::-e (S,jn) and 
let fn : S,. --> M (n 2: 1) be a sequence of (jn, J)-holomorphic curves in the 
compact Hermitian manifold (111, J, ft) with uniformly bounded area: 
Area(fn)::; C 
(Vn 2: 1). 
A remark concerning the notation: we shall always omit the subindices of sub-
sequences; so, for example, a subsequence of (Sn)n;::-:1 will again be denoted by 
(Sn)n:::0:1· 
By means of lemma 7.13 we first choose a finite subset Fn ~ S,. for each 
n 2: 1 such that fn Is;, is universally Lipschitz bounded on s~ := S,. \ Fn with 
respect to the Poincare metric hn. The number kn of points in Fn is universally 
bounded. Taking a subsequence of Un)n;::-:1 we can assume that kn =: k does 
not depend on n. and consequently the hyperbolic surfaces are all of the same 
signature (g,O,k). 

7.3 GromO\·'s Compactness Theorem 
161 
For each n 2: 1 let us denote the geodesics on (S~,. hn) with length less 
than 2 arsinh1 by/';, (i = 1, 2, ... , ln)· These geodesics arc pairwise disjoint 
(sec for example [16], collar theorem) and their number b bounded by 3g-3+k 
for every n 2: 1. Again we can take a subsequence such that 1, =: l' docs not 
depend on n. 
In a further step a marking of S should be taken into account. In other 
words: we wish to have a diffeomorphism Xn : Sj ---> S~ such that XnhiJ = /':, 
for i = 1, ... . l'. This can indeed be realized if we take once again a subsequence 
of Un)n';>:l· 
All those i for which the lengths l (!';.) do not converge to 0 for n ---> oc 
arc not interesting for us and the corresponding geodesics /';, arc no longer 
considered. So for every n there arc 10 geodesics left: 1,~, ... , 1!~. Moreover 
x(ri) = ~~ for all t E {1, ... , lo} =:I (if lo = 0, then I= 0). LetS~, ... , s;;•o 
denote the components of s;. \ Uh:.: i E I}. Xn(Sl) = s~ for v = 1. ... , mo. 
Shrinking the curves 1! for i E I we get, as in section 7.2, a singular 
surface S. At this point the convergence of hyperbolic structures enters: 
Proposition 7.16 ([61, IV.3.4]) There exist a subsequence of (S,)n?:1· a com-
plex structure I on S and a jinit1~ snbset F ~ 5'\si(S) such that for every n 2: 1 
a deformation 'Pn : Sn ---> S exists with the following properties: 
1. 'Pn maps Fn bijectively onto F. 
2. (<p;;_- 1 )*hn converges to the Poincare metric h on S \ (F U si(S)) in the 
ex-topology for n---> 00. 
3. (<p;;_- 1r]n converges in the C 00 -topology to Ils\si(S) for n---> oc. 
How do we find the subsequence, the deformations and the complex struc-
ture I? \ \'e successively apply the Proposition of section 7.2 (describing conver-
gence of hyperbolic structures) to (S~)n::>: 1 , (S~)n::>: 1 ..... (S;;•o)n::>: 1. In this way 
we get the subsequence fn : Sn ---> Jlvf, the deformations 'Pn and the singular 
Riemann surface ( S, I). 
The corollary formulated above as well as the com:ergence of (<p;;_- 1 )* hn to h 
on S \ (F u si(S)) (with respect to the C00-topology) imply the equicontinuity 
and Lipschitz boundedness of fn o <p;:;- 115\(Fu .• ;(.~)) on compact subsets. The 
theorem of Arzda-Ascoli therefore guarantees the existence of a subsequence 
of fn o <;;;: 1 which, restricted to S \ (F U si(S') ), converges to a continuous map 
f: S \ (F u si(S)) _, (M. J, Jl) 
in the C0-topology. By the generalized Weierstrass theorem and because of 
the C0!1Yergence of (<p;;_- 1)*jn in the C 00-topologv. we can conclude that the 
(( <p;;_- 1 )* j,.. J)-holomorphic maps fn o <p;:;- 1 converge to f on S \ (F U si(S)) even 
in the cx:-topology, and in addition f is (J, J)-holomorphic.

enables ns to apply the theorem on removing singularities. j then extends 
to a .J-holomorphic map on S (S and a : S --> S have been introduced in 
section 7.2). 
In order to finish the proof of the compactness theorem two properties 
should be verified: 
(a) J is compatible with a. This provides the (J. .J)-holomorphic cusp-curve 
J: S--> AI, now defined on the whole surface S. 
(b) Un 0 <p,";" 1 ) converges to fls\.•i(S) in the ex-topology. 
Property (a) is verified in the following way: assnme that there exists a

}(s') f. }(s"). Let p := min{Eo, id(}(s'),}(s"))}. Then inS we can choose 
compact connected neighbourhoods U' and U" of s' and s", respectively, such 
that }(U') ~ Bp(}(s')) and }(U") ~ Bp(}(s")). Taking U' and U" small 
enough we get, becausc of (7.2)

So the monotonicity lemma gives 
But this contradicts the estimate above: Area(fnl.,;;la(U'UU")) <CAlL· p2 . 
Property (b): Uno <p;;- 1) converges on S\si(S) to J in the Co-topology.

eralized Weierstrass theorem. 
This finally is the end of the proof of Gromov's compactness theorem. D 
\Vc close this chapter with some remarks on bubbles. Under certain cir-
cumstances the limits of convergent sequences of pscudoholomorphic curves 
arc special cusp-cun·cs. Roughly speaking, the tied up surfaces on which these 
cusp-curves arc defined, look like the original S to which a finite number of 
spheres (so called bubbles) have been attached. In fact, this occurs if all the 
pscudoholomorphic curves fn of the convergent sequence are parametrized by 
the same Riemann surface (S,j). 
Theorem 7.17 Let fn : (S,j) --> (l\1, J, J.l) (where n 2:: 1} be a sequence of 
(j, J)-holornorphic curves with Area(/n) < C which converges to the cusp-
curve j: (S,J)--> (J/,J,/t) in M. Then (S,J) is conformally equivalent to the 
dL~joint union of S with at most finitely many 2-spheres. 
It is not too difficult to show that (S,J) is diffeomorphic to S and a 
certain number of disjoint spheres. One has to prove the existence of a constant

c > 0 (depending only on ( S, j)) with the following properties: If F is a finite 
set of points in S and S \ F is endowed with the Poincare metric, then each 
simple dosed geodesic on S \ F of length less than cis homotopic to zero in S. 
These null homotopic geodesics arc responsible for the tied up 2-sphcres. The 
conformal equivalence stated in the theorem above is somewhat more involved 
(consult [61, Thm 4.~]). 
vVe remark that intuitively the bubbles arc pscudoholomorphic curves 
S2 -> AI catching the area "lost" at a finite number of points s E (S,j) in 
the limit process.

Contact structures 
Contact manifoldo arc odcl-climcu~ional manifolds iii = 1\!2"+ 1 which carry a 
completely uoniutcgrablc field ~ of hyperplanes. Locally ~uch a field is deter-
mined by a one-form n, E, = { n = 0} and the nonintegrability condition can be 
stated as nA (dn)" c/c 0. Contact manifolds arc intimately related to symplectic 
manifolds. They can naturally be embedded as ourfaces of contact type in their 
symplectification, which is a symplectic manifold of dimension 2n + 2 naturally 
associated to AI (sec section 8.2). 
\\"e consider general properties of contact manifolds in the first section. 
Among the examples, the surfaces of contact type in a symplectic manifold arc 
particularly important, because they arise as integral surfaces AI = { H = 0} of 
Hamiltonian sy:;tems. They have proved useful in connection with the problem 
of finding periodic solutions of Hamiltonian oystemo. In 1979 \Vcinstein had 
conjectured that such periodic solutions exist on surfaces on contact type. Iu 
1987 Viterbo gave an affirmative solution to the conjecture and abo showed 
that the \·anishing of the first homology clnss (a~ it \\·as originally required) 
was an irrelevant condition in this context. 
In complex analysis contact manifolds 1\I also arise as boundaries 11! = 
DS1 of strictly pscudocom·cx domains S1 in complex manifolds. The fidd of 
hyperplanes is the field~ of maximal complex invariant subs paces of the tangent 
space. The pseudoconvexity condition guarantees the complete nonintegrability 
of E,. 
In sections 8.4 to 8.6 we study contact structures on 3-rnanifolds. The 
chapter ends with a section on Eliashberg's classification results. The contact 
structures on 3-manifolds are quite peculiar. They can be divided up into tight 
and ovcrtwisted structures (this terminology is due to Eliashbcrg). The stan-
dard structure on the sphere S3 is tight (Benncquin"s theorem), but it is the 
only (positively oriented) tight contact structure on s<l. Overtwistecl structnrcs 
arc characterised by the property that the characteristic foliations of embedded 
2-dimcnsional surfaces may contain closed leaves. The overtwistcd structures 
arc quite Hcxiblc, the tight structures on the contrary arc rather rigid. 
Index theorems for embedded surfaces and invariants for transversal and 
Lcgcndrian curves determine the analysis of contact 3-manifolds. Auxiliary 
complex structures play a critical role in the proof that certain contact struc-
tures arc tight. Some of our efforts arc indeed spent on proving Gromov's the-
orem, which says that tillable contact structures arc tight (sec section 8.6.3).

The nonintcgrability condition takes the form

reformulated as 
(dati~ f. 0. 
The n-th exterior product of do: is thus a nonvanishing vohunc dement on ~­

If n is odd, then the sign of o. 1\ (do)" is independent of the sign of o.. The 
contact manifold is oriented. If n is even, then the sign of (do.)nl{ is independent 
of the sign of o.. This means that the hyperplanes from the contact distribution 
e arc oriented. 
A contact transformation f : M --> N between contact manifolds (A/, e)

then J* ,6 = .X.o. with A a nonvanishing scalar function. 
There are no local invariants for contact structures. 
Theorem 8.1 (Darboux) Locally any contact structure is equivalent to the 
standard structure {no = 0} in R 2n+I, 
n 
no= L( -yjdXj + xidYi) + dz

(the coordinates of points in R 2"+ 1 are denoted by x 1, ... , Xn. Yl, ... , Yn• z). 
Proof. If a given contact structure is locally described by the one-form ,6 defined 
in a neighbourhood of the origin in R 2"+ 1, then there is a linear mapping

First map the contact planes at the origin {no = 0} and {iJ = 0} onto each 
other by a linear mapping which is symplectic with respect to the forms dn0 ami 
d(3. In the second step extend this to a linear map of the whole tangent space 
at the origin, by mapping the vector X which is determined by the equations 
no(X) = 1 and X-.Jdno = 0 
onto the \·ector Y determined by the corresponding equations for /): 
iJ(Y) = 1 and Y -.Jd.:J = 0. 
The pullback of the form (3 by the linear mapping l is denoted by n 1 
(.t[ = l* {3 
and we define the homotopy 
fit= (1- t)no +tnt. 
At the origin no = n 1 = n1 and dna = dn 1 = dn1. There exists therefore a 
neighbourhood U of the origin such that for all t E [0. 1] the form dn1 restricted 
to { n 1 = 0} is nonclegcncratc. In the proof of Gray's theorem we will conHtruct 
an isotop~· of mappings 'Pt. defined in a neighbourhood of the origin, such that 
t E [0, 1]. 
It then follows that no = <p';n 1 = <p';l* !]. This will complete the proof of

Proof. The proof once again is based on 1\loser's method. We start off with the 
fundamental formula (sec e.g. [51]) 
where ;:1 is the flow of the time dependent vector field v and the differential 
form v is allowed to depend on t. 
Choose differential forms {) 1 which locally represent~~ and depend smooth-
ly on t. The vector field v will have to be determined in such a way that

with some nonvanishing scalar function At· This will then mean 
Combined with the fundamental formula this leads to the equation 
(8.1) 
which has to be solved for v (v will depend on t). The function J1 is taking the 
place of ( fft log >.t) o 'Pt 1. 
The characteristic vector field Tt (or Rech vector field for the form tlt) is 
determined by the equations 
If T = T1 is inserted in the preceding equation, then J.L can be expressed in 
dependence of v and iJ = tl1: 
There exists now a unique vector field v E ~t which solves (8.1). For v E ~~ the 
equation (8.1) reduces to 
d{} 
v...Jdtl = J.Ltl -
dt 
The function J.L is determined such that the form'"'/ = J.Ltl- ~~ satisfies '"'!(T) = 0. 
Since dtJI~t is noll-degenerate, there exists then a unique v E ~~ with v...Jdtl = '"'!· 
Next, observe that the vector field v E ~~ is canonically defined. It is 
independent of the choice of the differential forms tlt which represent ~t· If 
{jt = attlt, at =/= 0 is a different form representing ~t and if u· E ~~ is the solution 
of 
d 
-
dt(attlt) + w...Jd(at'!9t) = J.Ltlt 
(with some different {l), then

atdt + w...J(dat 1\ tlt) + w...J(atdtlt) = J.Ltlt- dttl 1 . 
Using 
we get 

8.1 Contact manifolds 
Applying the last equation to T1 yields 
and v and w arc solutions of the same equation, hence v = w. 
The Ycctor field v can thus be defined globally and it follows that 
~(<P;1'Jt) = 4';(JL1'Jt) = (p o <Pt)<P;vt

The proof shows that the deformation 4't is uniquely determined by the 
requirement that the generating vector field v be "horizontal" i.e. v E ~~-
To complete the proof of Darboux' theorem we show that v = 0 at the 
origin (for all t). If v and <Pt arc determined from the differential forms a 1: 
cp;a1 = o 0 • then >..1 = 0, hence It= 0, and one has at the origin 
1he equation for vis v...Jda 1 = -flta1• Together with the nondcgencracy of da 1 
this shm\·s that v = 0 at the origin. 
A curve 1 in a contact manifold (M, ~) is tmnst•ersal, if at all points p 
on the curve the contact plane ~ is transversal to the tangent vector !fit to the 
curve. 
\\"ith the above methods we can classify (following Lutz [68] and l\Iar-
tinct [69]) the germs of contact structures transversal to a circle. For this, 
consider the manifold S 1 x R 2n with the standard contact form

Go = dl9 + 2:( -yjdXj + :r·jdYj) 
j=l 
and the circle 1 = S 1 x {0} parametrized by{) E [0, 2rr). 
Theorem 8.3 (Lutz, Martinet) Assume that ~ is a contact structure de-
fined in a neighbourhood of 1 and transversal to I· Then there exists a diffeo-
morphism <,? defined in a neighbourhood of 1 such that <Ph = id and 4'•~ = ~o

Proof. In a neighbourhood of{, the contact structure~ can he defined with a 
single differential form a and a( 1?,;) i= 0 on 1 by transvcrsality. vVithout loss 
of generality it can he assumed that n( 1fu) = 1. There exists then a function f

In fact, since /}0 ! = 0 and aC~1 ) = 1 along{, the equation

Since Cfu...Jdn)(J~) = 0, such a function clearly exists. 
\Vc conclude that ncar 1 the contact structure ~ can be represented by a 
differential form a with the property that at all points of 1

The R 2n fiber bundles ~o ---+ S 1 and ~ -> S1 arc symplectic vector bundles

is a linear map 
hr! : (~o)(v,o) ---+ ~(r!,o) 
such that h~da: = dna. This map is unique up to composition with clements 
of Sp(n, R). But because the group Sp(n, R) is connected, the mappings ho 
can be adjusted along 1 to depend smoothly on 19. There results a bundle map 
h : ~0 ---+ ~ between the bundles ~0 ___, S 1 and ~ ---+ S 1 such that 
h*da: = dao. 
Consider an arbitrary Riemannian metric on S 1 x R 2 n. The associated 
exponential map establishes a diffeomorphism 
between a neighbourhood of the zero section of the vector bundle~ ---+ S 1 and a 
neighbourhood of the circle 1 in S 1 x R 2 n (and a similar diffeomorphism exp0 
for ~o).

Symplectification 
Example The orientable projectivization PT* V of the cotangent bundle of an 
n-dimensional manifold V becomes a contact manifold in a natural way. The 
clemc11ts in PT*V arc the equivalence classes of 1-forms !9 at a point p E V 
with Vp ~ !9~ if !9~ = )..73P for some ).. > 0. As such. the points in PT*V 
are the .. contact clements" of V. These are the oriented hyperplanes in Tp V 
represented as the kernel of the 1-forms 73P in the equiYalcnce class [73p]· There 
exists a canonical plane field ~ in the tangent space of the manifold I\ I = PT* V. 
A vector X is in ~ if it describes a deformation of the field of contact planes 
whereby the point of contact moves in a direction lying in the contact element. 
The situation is the same as in skating. On the iccrink (manifold V) the 
skates arc the contact elements. They arc always moved in the direction of the 
skates.

S = {! = 0} 
and dfls # 0. 
The characteristic line field Ls on a hypersurface in a symplectic manifold is 
determined by the Hamiltonian vector field X f to the function f: 
Cs ={eX!: c E R}. 
In differ~nt terms, a vector X E TS is in Ls if 
w(X, Y) = 0 for allY E TS. 
(Note that the Hamiltonian vector field Xf, which is defined by Xj...JW = df, is 
tangent to S.) 
If f and g are two functions which define the same hypersurface S =

characteristic line field Ls remains the same and X 9 = )..Xf on S. 
Definition 8.5 (Weinstein) A hypersurface S in a symplectic manifold

OhserYc that for dim S > 3 condition (i) can be replaced hy 
(i') duln=O = i*wln=O· 
This condition will then imply 
i*w=do+oAiJ 
and a 1\ v must be closed since hoth i*w and do arc closed 
d(o A iJ) = det A{)- a A d1) = 0. 
~-hen restricted to { n = 0} this gives 
da A 7Jia=O = i*w A 1Jin=O = 0. 
But if dim S > 3, then 1Jiu=O >--> ·i*w A 1Jin=O is injective so that iilo=O = 0. 
Therefore d =fa and a A{) =a A fa = 0. It follows that i*w =do. 
Generally, the contact structure on a hypersurfacc S of contact type is not 
uniquely determined. The 1-form a which appears in the definition defines a 
contact structure. But there will in general exist closed 1-forms {3 on S such that 
one still has (a+f3)(X) # 0 for X E £s \ {0} and because d(o+ 10) = d(~ = i*w, 
the form a + {3 will then define a different contact structure on S. 
Definition 8.6 The vector field X on the symplectic manifold ( P, w) is a sym-
plectic dilation (or· as a synonym a homothctic vector field} if £xw = .JJ. 
Lemma 8.7 (Weinstein, [109]) A hypersurface S C P is of contact type if and 
only if there exists a symplectic dilation X (defined in a neighbourhood of S) 
which is transversal to S. 
Proof. If X is a transversal symplectic dilation, set n = x__.w. Then 
w 
Define a = i*n to obtain da = i* dQ = i*w. The Hamiltonian vector field X f 
then satisfies 
since X is transversal to S.

-w(XJ, X)= -df(X) # 0

Conversely, if a is a 1-form on S such that da = i*w and a(XJ) =/= 0, then 
there exists an extension a of a defined in a neighbomhoocl U of S such that 
a = i*a and dri = w in U. 
A proof of this fact will follow. If the vector field X b then defined by 
X_jw =a, 
then X is a symplectic dilation: 
The \'ector field X is transversal to S, since 
-df(X) = a(XJ) =/= 0. 
For the proof of the extension result we need the following lemma (a 
variant of the Poincare lemma). 
Lemma 8.8 LetS be a hypersurface in P and i: S---> P the embedding map. 
If >. is a closed p-forrn nearS such that i* >. = 0, then th~re exists a p- 1-forrn 
i) defined in a neighbourhood of S such that >. = diJ and ills = 0. 
Proof. Choose a Riemannian metric on P and consider the flow 1/Js of the vector 
field grad f (with f the defining function for S). On the neighbourhood U of 
S which con~ists of all points that can be reached from S within time lsi < 1 
U = {V>s(x): XES, lsi< 1} 
we define the retraction 'Pt : U---> U, t E [0, 1]: 
'Pt(z) = 1/'ts(x)

Clearly 'Ptls = ids. 'Pt = idu and <po : U ---> S. It can be assumed that >. is

Clearly, AI is a surface of contact type in P, since

structure J. If the plane field ~ is completely nonintegrablc, then it defines a 
contact structure on S. Such is the situation for strictly pscudoconvex surfaces. 
Cousider a domain D given by a defining function {! 
D = {z E en: g(z) > 0} 
with dglav f. 0. The differential form 
defines the )-invariant hypersurfaces ~P in TpaD 
Clearly, f) f. 0 if dg f. 0. The form 
L(X, Y) = -d19(X, JY) 
is the Levi form for the domain D. 
Definition 8.10 The domain D = {g > 0} is strictly pseudoconvex, if the 
Levi form L restricted to ~ is positive definite at every point p E aD. The 
surface S = aD will be called a strictly pseudoconvex surface. 

8.3 Strictly pseudoconvex surfaces

The Levi form L on ~ is only determined up to a conformal factor. The 
defining function (} can be replaced by f · (} with f Y, 0. This will then change 
the Levi form on ~ by the factor f. 
Pscudoconvexity is a biholomorphically invariant notion. If f : G __. G' is 
a biholomorphic mapping and Sa pscudoconvcx surface in the domain C, then 
its image f(S) is again pscudoconvcx. 
ObscrYc that the surfaces of contact type and the pseudoconvex surfaces 
arc of a different nature. One of the definitions is symplcctically invariant, the 
other holomorphically. The only mappings in C" which arc both symplectic and 
holomorphic with respect to the standard structures arc the unitary mappings, 
the translations and the compositions thereof. 
Domains in C" arc Kahler manifolds. They come with an intrinsic sym-
plectic structure which "blows up" at the boundary. The Kahler metric h is 
naturally defined through the Bergman kernel K(z. () by the formula 
The Kahler fomt !1 = 2Rc(ih) is the associated real (symplectic) form

and g = 2 Re h is the Bergman metric. 
The complex structure J remains the same as on the underlying space C". 
In real notation the form !1 can be written as 
A mapping;: : D __. G between domains in C", which is symplectic with respect 
to their Kahler forms !1v and !1c is a diffeomorphism satisfying rp*!1c = !1v. 
Proposition 8.11 [63] A diffeomorphism 'P: D __. G between strictly pseudo-
convex domains which extends smoothly to the boundaries and which is symplec-
tic with respect to the Kahler forms !1v, !10 will extend as a contact transform 
to the boundaries. 
There is a partial converse to this statement which at least holds for map-
pings of the unit ball B = {lzl < 1} C C". 
Proposition 8.12 [63] If 1(; :DB__. DB is a contact transform which embeds 
into a contact isotopy 'lj;1 No =id, 1/Jt = 1(; ), then~,:· extends to a diffeomorphism 
'P: B __. B which is symplectic with respect to the Kahler form: rp*!1a = !1a.

If mappings arc considered which arc symplectic with respect to the stan-
dard underlying symplectic structure wo of C", then neither of these state-
ments will be true. In this context, the intrinsic symplectic structure given by 
the Kahler forms is much more appropriate than the undcrl~·ing symplectic 
structure w0 . Pscudoconvcxity can be defined in a more general context. 
Definition 8.13 If (At, J) is a manifold with a complex structure J (not nec-
essarily integrable) and S is a wrface which is given by a defining function {!, 
S = {g = 0}, dgls of 0, then a ]-invariant field~ of hyperplanes in TS will be 
defined by the form 
o: = -i(EJg- Dg) = -Jdg, 
whe·re De= !(dg+iJdg). The surfaceS will be called ]-convex. if the quadratic 
form -do:( X, J X) restricted to 
~={o:=O} 
is positive definite (at all points of S). 
1\otc that in contrast to the case of strictly pscudoconvcx surfaces in com-
plex manifolds, the form do:( X, JY) will not necessarily be symmetric. The 
Levi form should then be defined by 
1 
L(X, Y) = - 2(do:(X, JY) + do:(Y, JX)). 
Proposition 8.14 If S is a hypers-urface of contact type in a symplectic man-
ifold ( P, w), then there exists a complex structure J tamed by w such that S is 
.J -convex. 
Proof. \Ve first construct .J in a neighbourhood of S. Let X be the symplectic 
dilation transversal to S which exists in a neighbourhood of S (Lemma 8.7). 
The form o: = X...Jw then satisfies do:= w. A new defining function a for Scan 
be constructed in a neighbourhood of S as follows: If 'Pt is the flow generated 
by X, set 
a(x) = t 
if 
<.p1(x) E S, 
then TS = {da = O}ls and da(X) = X(a) = -1 (sec Figure 3). 
Since w is non-degenerate, there exists a unique vector field Y (defined in 
a neighbourhood of S) such that da = Y ...Jw. It follows that 
w(X, Y) = -(Y ...Jw)(X) = -da(X) = 1. 
At every point pin a neighbourhood of S, TpP decomposes into the subspace 
{X, Y} spanned by X and Y and its symplectic orthogonal {X, Y}.l. The 
complex structure J is then defined such that {X, Y} and {X, Y}.l are ]-
invariant and such that 
JX=Y, JY=-X. 

8.3 Strictly pseudoconvex surfaces 
181 
s 
Figure 3 
vVith this choice, the contact structure defined by n = X...Jw coincides with the 
contact structure induced by the complex structure J: 
.ldCT =a. 
Indeed, both J dg and n vanish on 
{X, Y}.L = {Z: n(Z) = 0 and dCT(Z) = 0}. 
On the other hand, 
JdCT(X) 
a(X) 
JdCT(Y) 
a(Y) 
dCT(JX) = du(Y) = (Y ...Jw)(Y) = 0 
w(X,X) = 0 
dCT(.JY) = -du(X) 
-(Y ...J...:)(X) = w(X, Y) 
(X...Jw)(Y) = w(X, Y) = 1 
1 
We now have to construct J globally. In a neighbourhood U of a point p E S 
a metric ILL" can be chosen such that X and Y arc orthonormal and such that 
the symplectic orthogonal {X, Y}.L is also orthogonal to {X, Y} with respect 
to f.lL". For neighbourhoods off the surface S any metric will do. By using a 
partition of unity we then arrive at a metric tL which is defined globally. The 
orthogonality properties near S arc preserved. Since w is non-degenerate, there 
exists a unique automorphism A of T P such that 
w(Z, Z') = f.l(AZ, Z') 
for all Z, Z' E TP. 
Observe that -A2 is positive definite with respect to 11: 
w(-AZ,Z') = w(Z'.AZ) 
J.L(AZ',AZ) = J.L(AZ,AZ'). 

182 
8 Contact structures 
At the same time this computation shows that A is skew-symmetric with re-
spect to Jl· Set therefore J = (-A 2 )- ~A and define a modified metric 
v(Z,Z') = J.L(Z, (-A 2 )~Z'). 
Then J is compatible with w, since 
w(Z, JZ') 
w(Z, (-A 2 )-~AZ') 
J.L(AZ, ( -A 2 )-~ AZ') 
v(Z,Z') 
It must be verified that J X = Y for the special vector fields defined above. 
But the metric fL in a neighbourhood of S is chosen such that X and Y arc 
orthonormal and orhogonal to the symplectic orthogonal {X. Y}.L. The au-
tomorphism A therefore leaves invariant {X, Y} as well as {X. Y}.L and on 
{X, Y} it reduces to 
AX=Y, 
AY=-X, 
since 1 = w(X, Y) = J.L(AX, Y) = -J.L(X, AY). The complex structure J = 
(-A2 )-~A therefore has the desired properties.

Plane fields on 3-manifolds 
A contact structure ~ on a 3-dimensional manifold is locally determined by a 
differential1-form. If in local coordinates 'Pi : uj ....... R 3 ~is giYen by aj: 
then there exist non-vanishing functions J;i : U; n Ui ....... R \ {0} such that 
aj = /;jai on U; n Uj. The volume forms aj 1\ daj satisfy 
and therefore determine an orientation of the manifold 11!. If M is already 
oriented, then the contact structure ~ is called positive, if the orientation given 
by ~ coincides with the orientation of M. Otherwise ~ is a negative contact 
structure. A distribution ~ of 2-dimensional plane fields (and in particular a 
contact structure ~) is transversally oriented if the local 1-forms ai can be 
determined such that all transition functions /;j are positive. It is then possible 
to construct a globally defined 1-form a such that 
~={a= 0} 
(just use a partition of unity for this construction). 

8.4 Contact o;tmcturco; on 3-manifolds 
Two di~tributions ~o and 6 arc homotopic if there exist~ a continuous 
family ~~. t E [0, 1]. of distributions connecting ~11 to ~ 1
. On the sphere 5 3 , the 
homotopy classes of distributions~ arc classified by r.3 (RP2 ) in the following 
way: 
5 3 identifies with 5U(2). Set z1 = x 1 + ix 2 . z2 = x 3 + i:r4 and represent 
the elements of 8U(2) by 
-::) 
Zj 
The points :r on 8:1 arc obtained as 
and the group acts by left (or right) translation on 8 3 
The tangent bundle T5:1 is therefore isomorphic to a product 
T8'1 ~5 3 X g 
of 8 3 with the Lie algebra g of 8U(2). As a vector space, g ~ R 3 . The clements 
in g arc the left invariant vector fields. A distribution ~ on 8 3 determines now a 
mapping from 8 3 to the ~pace of 2-dimensional subs paces of R 3 . This space in 
turn is isomorphic to RP2 . The homotopy classes of distributions ~ therefore 
arc the elements in r.3(RP2 ). 
If transversally oriented distributions arc classified up to homotopies, then 
these gi\·e rise to mappings from 8 3 to the space of oriented two-dimensional 
real subspaces of R 3 and this space is isomorphic to 8 2 . The homotopy classes 
of transwrsally oriented di~tributions are thus given by the clements of r.3(82), 
i.e. by thl'ir Hopf invariant. For a discussion of the isomorphism r.3(52 ) ~ Z 
and the geometric ideas behind the Hop£ invariant we rcf<:'r to [15, p. 227ff]. 
The standard contact structure ~0 on 5 3 consists of the complex invariant 
plane fidel. which can be described by the differential form 
1J 
-i(8- 8) (\zi\2 + \z2\2- 1)

The action of SU(2) extends to a holomorphic action on C 2 . Since ~0 is defined 
as the complex invariant plane field, it is invariant under the action of SU(2). 
Therefore, the mapping S 3 --> S 2 associated to ~0 maps every point of S 3 onto 
the same two-dimensional oriented plane (spanned by Y3 and l~) in g ~ R 3 : 
this mapping is therefore constant. The Hopf invariant associated to ~o is zero. 
The homotopy classification for contact structures differs from the homo-
topy classification for plane distributions. In the case of the sphere there arc 
two homotopy classes of contact structures which as plane fields both have Hopf 
invariant zero (hence arc homotopic as plane fields) but which arc not homo-
topic via contact structures. One of these structures is the standard structure 
~0 (which is tight) and the other is the ovcrtwistcd contact structure with Hopf 
invariant zero. 
The notions of tight and ovcrtwistcd contact structures will be discussed 
at length in the section 8.5. At this point we state Eliashbcrg's classification 
theorem for contact structures on the sphere. 
Theorem 8.15 On S 3 there are exactly two homotopy classes of transversally 
oriented contact structures with H opf invariant zero, the tight and the over-
twisted. There is exactly one homotopy class (the overtwisted} of transversally 
oriented contact structures in any homotopy class of plane fields with prescribed 
Hopf invariant different from zero. 
8.4.2 
Invariant contact structures on the solid torus 
Definition 8.16 On S 1 X R 2 we will denote the unit tangent vector field in 
the direction of the circles S 1 x {(x,y)} by J/0 = 1t. A differential form won 
S 1 X R 2 is 5 1-invariant, if Lu w = 0.

with a a differential on!'-form and f a function on R 2 • The form w defines a 
contact structure on S 1 x R 2 if w/\dw oft 0. For 5 1-invariant forms the condition

8.4.3 
Martinet's theorem 
Theorem 8.19 ([69]) On every compact orientablc 3-manifold there exists a 
contact structure. 
The proof is based on a structure theorem for compact oricntable 
3-manifolds which is due to Likorish [67]. We will first sketch the background 
for this result. 
Start with a self indexing l\Iorse function on AI, i.e. a ;\lorse function 
f : AI --> [0, 3] with 
{p E AI: p critical point off with index i} <;;; f- 1(i) 
i = 0, 1, 2, 3 and such that there exists only one relative maximum and one 
relative minimum. The level set f- 1 ( ~) is a surface of some genus g and the 
sets AL = J- 1 [0, ~ J and M+ = f- 1 [ ~. 3] each consist of a 3-ball with g handles 
attached. 
As an example take the sphere 
53 = {(z1,z2) E C2: jz1j2 + jz2j2 = 1} 
and the l\Iorsc function j(zt, z2) = ~(xt + 1), where Z1 = Xt + iYt· The surface 
f- 1 (~) = {x1 = 0} is a sphere S 2 and the sets f- 1[0, i!J and f- 1 [~,3] arc 
3-balls. The orientation preserving diffcomorphisms of si: arc isotopic to the 
identity l95]. 
In the general situation, any orientation preserving diffeomorphism f : 
~ --> ~ of the compact surface of genus g is isotopic to a product of Dehn twists 
along a basic system of 3g -1 curves. Given such a diffeomorphism, there exists 
a finite number of disjoint solid tori Vi in ~ x (0, 1) and a diffeomorphism 
F: ~X [0, 1] \ (U;V;) --t ~ x [0, 1] \ (U;V;) 
such that 
Fb::x{O} = f 
F!Ex{l} = id. 
The tori Vi should be thought of as tori with cores, along which the Dehn twists 
operate. 
Compact oriented 3-manifolds can then be constructed from the solid torus 
T = S 1 x D 2 and a system T;, i = 1, ... , r, of solid tori around a family of curves 
'Yi CT. These curves can be realized as graphs of differentiable mappings from 
0 
5 1 into D 2 . Given a system <I> of diffcomorphisms 
'Po: aT _. aT 
r.p; :

aT; 
i = 1, ... ,r 
r + 1 copies of the torus T can then be glued in to give a manifold 
Mq, = (T \ ur= 1 T;) u<;?u T u'P, ... U10r T. 

8A Contact structures on 3-manifolcls 
lH9 
Theorem 8.20 ([67]) Any compact orientable 3-manifold is diffeomorphic: to 
a manifold 1\Iq, of the obove type. 
l\Iartinct observes that the mappings describing the system of curves ri 
can be chosen in an arbitrary C 1-neighbourhoocl of the zero mapping and that 
the tori T; can he chosen within arbitrarily small tubular neighbourhoods of 
the CUI\TS '!!. 
The proof of Martinet's result proceeds now as follows: AI is diffeomorphic 
to some ,1!.0 . On the toms T = 8 1 x D 2 start with the canonical contact 
structure ~0 given by the form 
wo = rh? + 1: dy - y d.r. 
This structure is transverse to all curves {' \\·hirh arc graphs of mappings 
8 1 __, D 2 contained in a C 1-ncighbourhood of the zero mapping. In partic-
ular, the curves { 1 which appear in the constmction for ALp arc transversal to 
the canonical contact structure. Theorem 8.3 then establishes the existence of 
diffeomorphisn1s 1/J; of T; onto T such that 
where ~o.i is the restriction of ~0 to T;. 
Since isotopic mappings ifJ, ~ 'P: (i = 0, .... r) give diffeomorphic man-
ifolds and since every automorphism of 5' 1 x S 1 is isotopic to a nninwdnlar 
transformation 'PA E G£(2. Z). it can he assumed that 
1/J; o 'Pi : [)T __, [)T 
is a unimodular transformation. The result from section 8.4.2 shows that the 
contact structure ~0 on T \ Uj= 1 T; extends to 
This giws the desired contact structure on .U. 
Recently Giroux [49] presented a new proof for 1\Iartinct 's theorem. The 
constructive part is again based on Morse theory. A 2-dimensional surface C 
embedded in a 3-dimcnsional manifold 111 is called essential for the proper 
Morse function f : AI--> [0, oo) if 
(i) fie is a proper Morse function. 
(ii) every critical point of fie is critical for f. 
(iii) local extremal points of fie are local extremal points of f.

Theorem 8.21 ([-!9]) Let M be a (not necessarily compact) oriented 3-mani-
fold. 
(A) There exists a proper Morse function f : ]If -> [0, oo) which admits an 
essential surface. 
(B) If f : 111 -> [0, oo) is a proper Morse function admitting an essential 
surface, then there exists a contact structure on ]If which induces the 
given orientation. Furthermore there exists a contact vector field X which 
is a pscudogradicnt for f, i.e. there e.Tist a Riemannian metric and a 
positive function s such that

Such contact structures are called convex {36}. 
Corollary 8.22 ([-!9, J]) On every oriented 3-dimensional manifold there ex-
ists a convex contact structure which induces the given orientation. 
8.5 
Two-dimensional surfaces in contact manifolds 
A surface S of real dimension two embedded in a contact 3-manifold Jvf carries 
a singular foliation. which is called the characteristic foliation. At the singular 
points p E S the tangent plane TpS coincides with the plane ~P from the contact 
field ~ on M. At the other points, TS n ~ defines a line field. The foliation is 
determined by this line field. If S is oriented and if ~ is transversally oriented, 
this line field will also be oriented. In the generic case, the singularities are 
isolated and non-degenerate. These singular points arc called elliptic if the 
index of the line field is 1 and hyperbolic if the index is -1. In the presence 
of orientations, singular points p arc positive if the orientations of TpS and ~P 
coincide. They arc negative if the orientations arc opposite. A ,·ector field Y 
directs the characteristic foliation, if Y E TSne, Y = 0 at singular points, and 
Y points in the "positive direction" (in the presence of orientation). The sign 
convention is such that a positive elliptic point is a source for the vector field. 
The leaves of the characteristic foliation arc the orbits of Y. 
8.5.1 
Germs of contact structures on 2-dimensional surfaces. 
Proposition 8.23 (Giroux) Assume that eo and 6 are contact structures de-
fined in a neighbourhood of the oriented closed surface S C .\I which in-
duce the same characteristic foliation of S. Then there exists an isotopy of 
diffeomorphisms yt· t E [0, 1], defined in a neighbourhood of S such that 
'Po = id, 'Ph eo = ~1 and such that the characteristic foliation is preserved: 
'PtS = S and all contact structures 'Pt• eo induce the same characteristic folia-
tion. 

8.5 Two-dimensional surfaces in contact manifolds 
1!)1 
Proof. The normal bundle of S, which is isomorphic to A 2 T S, can be mapped 
diffemnorphically onto a tubular neighbourhood U of S. The surface S being 
oriented. this gives a diffeomorphism 
8xR~A 2 TS--+UCjf 
and S x {0} is identified with the surface S C .1!. A germ ~ of a contact 
structure is transferred by this diffeomorphism to a contact structure on S x R 
which is defined ncar S x {0} and can be given by a one-form 
n = (Jt + 1lt dt. 
In this notation u 1 is a function and (31 is a one-form on S, both depending on 
a real parameter t. The characteristic foliation induced on S by~ is completely

8 Contact structures 
Definition 8.24 A contact structure on a 3-manifold AI is overtwisted, if 
there exists an embedded 2-disk D C AI such that {)D is a limit cycle of the 
characteristic foliation and such that D contains exactly one singular point 
(which necessarily is elliptic}. The contact structure is called tight if it is not 
overtwisted. 
Proposition 8.25 [33, Thm. 1.4.1] If ~ is a tight contact stmcture on AI, 
then for any embedded disc D C Af, the characteristic foliation contains no 
limit cycle. 
This proposition is based on the Elimination Lemma (Giroux, Fuchs, 
Eliashberg). A complete proof for the elimination lemma is given in [32, p. 6]. 
The reduction of the proposition to the elimination lemma is presented in [33]. 
Lemma 8.26 {Elimination lemma) ([32, p. 6]) Let S be an orientable em-
bedded surface in a contact manifold (V, ~) and p, q E S elliptic and hyperbolic 
points of the characteristic foliation F of the same sign. Let 1 be a leaf of F 
joining p to q h is the separatrix of the hyperbolic point q which goes top). 
Assume there are no other singularities in a neighbourhood of 1. Then there 
exists a C 0 -small isotopy h 1 : S--> V, t E [0, 1], such that 
ho 
id 
h1 
id on 1 and outside a fixed neighbour·hood U of"( 
( h 1 is an embedding for all t) 
and such thut the characteristic foliation F1 on h 1U has no singularities. 
Proof. Choose a one-form a representing the contact structure ~ in a neigh-
bourhood of 'Yanda surface clement won S. This determines a vector field Y, 
Y ...Jw = nls. directing the foliation, whose divergence at the singular points is 
positive: 
(divwY)w = d(Y ...Jw) =dais= kw. 
In fact, at the singularities the function k is positive since the orientation of S 
given by w and the orientation of ~ given by da coincide. 
The surface element w can now be changed into an element gw, g > 0, 
such that the divergence of Y with respect to gw is positive: 
(div9wY)gw = (divwY + Yg)gw. 
g 
Near the singular points g can be taken to be constant. Otherwise adjust g 
along the trajectories of the field such that 
Y(lng) > -divwY.

appears as the graph over U of a function f 
U __, R with support in a 
neighbourhood of 1. The restriction of /:i + dt to the graph of f is given by 
/:i + df. To be precise. ,3 + df is the pullback of :3 + dt under the mapping 
:r >-> (:r. f(.r)). :r E U. It suffices therefore to com;truct f with support ncar; 
such that 3 + df f 0 on U. The forrn {3 + dt restricted to the graph off will 
then never vanish. hence the clcformccl surface will have no singular points. The 
function f can be constructed such that Jl, = 0 and such that supxEU j(:r) is 
arbitrarily small. 
Choose local coordinates x : U ___. R 2 such that the elliptic point is mapped 
to ( -1, 0). the hyperbolic point to (1, 0) and the connecting trajectory onto the 
segment { (t. 0) : -1 -<:: t -<:: 1}. Furthermore, the local coordinates can be chosen 
such that for all :r2 in a neighbourhood of 0 but different from 0 the foliation 
is transversal to the lines :r·2 = const. For the surface clement w we choose the 
standard clement d:r1 1\ d:r2. The vector field Y' is defined by

Invariants for curves in contact manifolds 
We assume that the contact structure ~ on the oriented manifold M is described 
by the differential form a and a 1\ da > 0. By a curve we will understand a 
closed immersed oriented curve 1 : S 1 -> Jvl. A Legendre curve >. (also called 
a horizontal curve) is a curve >. : S 1 -> l'vl which is tangent to ~ at all points 
("; E ~)- A curve 1 is transversal, if the tangent vectors never lie in ~- It is 
positive transversal, if n(i') > 0 (respectively negative transversal if n(i') < 0). 
Definition 8.27 Let >. be a Legendre curve homologous to zero in M. Fix a 
relative homology class (3 E H2(1vf, >.) and an oriented surfaceS with boundary 
>. which represents .13. A new curve >.' is obtained by pushing >. slightly along 
a vector field X which is transversal to ~- The Thurston-Bennequin invariant 
tb( >., ,13) is the homological inte1·section number of >.' with the surface S. 

196 
8 Contact structures 
The Thurston-Bennequin invariant remains unchanged if the orientation 
of A is reversed. In the original definition given by Bennequin [11. p. 130] the 
cur\·e A is deformed in the direction of the vector field normal to the curve A, 
but contained in ~- This gives the same result. In fact, tb(A. 3) depends only 
on ~ restricted to A and on {3. 
In the case of the standard structure on R 3 given by w0 = d:: + y dx- x dy, 
or more generally '"'-" = dz + u dJ: + v dy, the invariant tb can he read off from a 
count of the self intersection points of the projected curve rr o A in the (x, y)-
plane. The intersections must be counted with the appropriate sign {sec Fig-
ure 7).

Definition 8.28 Assume that A is a Legendre curve homologous to zero. Let 
T be a tangent vector field along A and S an oriented surface with bounda·ry A, 
which represents (3 E H2(M, A). Choose a trivilization of the bundle ~Is· Then 
the degree of T with respect to the trivilization depends only on ,3. It is called 
the rotation number r(A, (3) of the curve A. 
The rotation number is the total variation of the angle of the tangent T 
with respect to a frame defining the trivialization of~- If the orientation of A 
is changed, then the rotation number also changes sign. 
Definition 8.29 Assume that "Y is a transversal curve homologous to zero and 
letS be an oriented surface with boundary "Y which represents 3 E H 2(1vl,"Y)· 
Take a nonvanishing horizontal vector field X on S (i.e. X E ~Is. X =f 0) and 
push "Y slightly along X. The intersection number l("Y', S) of the resulting curve 
"Y' with the surface S is independent of the vector field X chosen. It is called 
the self-linking number l("Y,(3) of"Y with respect to (3. 
In fact, if X and Y are two horizontal nonvanishing vector fields, then the 
difference of the linking numbers of "Y' with S and of "Y" (the curved obtained 
by pushing along Y) with S is the degree of the mapping 9 which associates 
to every point on "Y the angle between the vectors X and Y in the plane ~­
But 9 extends to a mapping M ---> 5 1 and therefore the degree of r.p is zero.

In manifolds M with a tight contact structure (Definition 8.24) the invariants 
characterize trivial knots (i.e. curves which bound an embedded disc) up to 
isotopics. We state without proof the following result of Eliashbcrg. 
Theorem 8.30 ([32, Thm. 5.1.1 and 5.7.1]) Assume that the contact structure 
~ on 1\1 is tight. 
(a) If ": and 1' are transversal trivial knots with I(!)= 1(1'), then 1 and 1' 
are isotopic as transversal knots. 
(b) If ,.\ and ,.\' are trivial Legendre knots with r(,.\) = r(,.\1) and tb(,.\) = 
tb(A'), then,.\ and ,.\' are isotopic as transversal knots. 
The inYariants arc related to each other. We will now formulate and prove 
Benncquin's equality. 
If a Legendre curve ,.\ is slightly pushed in direction of its oriented normal 
N within ~. then the resulting curve ,.\ + is negatively transversal to ~ (sec 
Figure 8). 
Figure 8 
Apply Stokes' formula to a rectangle R with one side on ,.\, one on ,.\ + and 
the two remaining sides given by c times the normal vectors N. Denote by T

The orientation of the normal vector N is defined by da(T, N) > 0. It fol-
lows that a(T+) < 0. In this way, Legendre curves can be approximated by 
negatively (or positively) transversal curves. 
Theorem 8.31 (Bennequin) If ,.\ is a Legendre curve homologous to zero in 
M, then

Proof. We follow Benncquin [11, Prop. 6]. Choose a surface S with as = ..\ 
which represents the homology class (3 E Hz(AI, ..\) and extend the horizontal 
normal vector field N to a vector field on all of S. Pushing S by c: along this 
field gives a new surface s+ with as+ = ..\ + = ..\ + c:N representing an clement

..\ + eN with respect to s+. On the other hand, l ( ..\ +, (3+) counts how often

l ( ..\ +. 3+) - tb( ..\, ;'J) is therefore the total variation of the angle of X with N 
along ..\ +, or what is the same, along ..\. But this is the rotation number 
l(>.. +, (3+)- tb(>.., (3) = r·(..\, (3). 
The equality for the curve ..\- is obtained by changing n into -a. Then the

Let us come back to the situation of an oriented compact surface embedded 
in a manifold AI with transversally oriented contact structure ~- Assume that 
the singularities of the characteristic foliation arc isolated elliptic or hyperbolic 
points. Denote by e+. h+ the number of positive elliptic and hyperbolic points, 
respectively, and usc e_, h_ for negative singularities. Set 
Take a vector field N normal to S and push the boundary curve 1 = as 
slighty in the direction of N. The intersection number of the resulting curve 
1' = 1 +eN with Sis zero, if the surface is embedded. 
Proposition 8.32 ([11, Thm. 7]) For an embedded oriented surfaceS with a 
transversal boundary 1 = as 
-l(--y) = d+- d_. 
Consider a vector field Y directing the characteristic foliation. Since 1 is 
transversal, the intersection number of 1+c:Y with Sis the same as the intersec-
tion number of 1 + c:N with S. It therefore vanishes. Take then a nonvanishing 
vector field X on JI. The difference of the intersection numbers of 1 +eX with 
S and of 1 + eY with S measures the total variation of the angle <p between 
X and Y along the curve 1· The total variation of cp along the boundary of 
a small disc centered at p is 2rr for positive elliptic and negative hyperbolic 
points p and -2rr otherwise. This proves the formula. 
Remark. Bennequin's theorem is more precise. It gives an expression for l(--y) 
in the case of an immersed and not only of an embedded surface.

Index theorems for 2-dimensional surfaces 
A point p on an oriented 2-<iimcnsional manifold S embedded in a 4-dimensional 
manifold .\I with (not necessarily intcgrabk) complex structure J is a point of 
complex tangency if TpS is a complex subspace of Tp.\I 
For generic cmbcddings, points of complex tangency arc isolated. The tangcn-
cics are positive if the orientation of TpS agrees with the complex orientation 
and they arc negative otherwise. Assume that w is a symplectic structure on 
M, compatible with J so that g(X, Y) = w(X, JY) defines a positive definite 
.!-invariant quadratic form on T M. In the neighbourhood of an isolated tan-
gency p. choose a vector field N along S which is normal to S (with respect 
to g). The field of ]-invariant 2-dimensional planes orthogonal toN and sym-
plcctically orthogonal to N intersects TS along a directed line field TJ which is 
singular at p. The tangency is called elliptic or hyperbolic, according to whether 
the line field TJ is elliptic or hyperbolic ncar p. Obseryc that different choices 
for the normal field arc homotopic and will lead to the same result. 
According to [13] a 2-dimcnsional surface embedded in C 2 can be rcpre-
scntPd in normal form 
z = ww + 2fJRcw2 + O(w3 ). 
3::::0 
ncar an isolated tangency p = (0, 0) (sec section 8.6.1). The normal vector field 
to the surface 
z = ww + 2fJRcw2 
can be chosen in the direction of the imaginary axis of z. The plane field is 
given by ;; = const and the integral curves for 17 project onto the level lines 
of the function 
u2 + v2 + 21'J(u2 - v2 ). 
Hence the point of tangency p = (0, 0) of a surface in normal form is elliptic if 
0 :::; fJ < ~ and hyperbolic if fJ > ~. 
Consider then a real 2-dimensional closed oriented surface S embedded in 
a complex 2-dimcnsional manifold M and assume that all points of tangency 
arc isolated and either hyperbolic or elliptic. The number of positive elliptic 
tangencics is denoted by e+(S), the number of positiYc hyperbolic tangcncies 
by h+(S) and similarly for negative complex tangencies. For embedded closed 
manifolds S '--' M, let x(S) denote the Euler characteristic, v(S) the normal 
Euler number and c(S) the first Chern clru;s of ,\I evaluated on the homology 
class realized by S.

For spheres embedded in C 2 this theorem was proved by E. Bishop [13]. 
In this case v(5) = 0 and c(5) = 0 so that 
E±- h± = 1. 
The general form of the theorem is due to Lai [64, Thm 4.10 and 5.11]. 
Following Bishop and Bcnnequin we will give a complete proof of this 
theorem for the case of an oriented closed surface 5 embedded in C 2 • 
The Gauss mapping associates to the point p E 5 the tangent space 
Tp5, considered as an clement of the Grassmann manifold G2.2 of oriented 
2-dimcnsional subs paces of R 4 . The Plucker coordinates a;j on the Grassman-

Then the coefficients satisfy

Conversely P E G2,2 is completely determined by a set of coordinates a;j satis-
fying these two relations. The linear coordinate change

will transform these relations into 
lxl = IYI = 1, 
so that G2,2 is diffeomorphic to the product of two unit spheres 5 1 and 52 in

The submanifold

The Gauss mapping has the components 9j =prj o g, where prj : G2,2-->

tangencies are given by g- 1(5t) = g1 1(1,0,0) and the negative tangencies by

Obstruction theory provides an interpretation of the formula

d± = 2(x(S) + v(S) ± c(S)) 
also in the case of bordered surfaces. Assume that S is an oriented compact 
embedded surface in a complex 2-dimensional manifold M such that the points 
of complex tangency are isolated elliptic or hyperbolic points, with no complex 
tangencics on as. Consider a vector bundle E __. S and a triangulation S = 
Utl.j of S such that each 2-simplex tJ.j lies in an open set U over which the 
bundle is isomorphic to the product bundle U x R 2 . The triangulation can be 
chosen such that the points of complex tangency are not on the 1-skclcton of 
the triangulation. Start now with a nonvanishing section of Eon the !-skeleton 
of the triangulation. This gives mappings 
DtJ.j is homeomorphic to 5 1 and R2 \ {0} retracts onto 5 1 . Tlms Uj can be 
extended to tJ.j if the homotopy class [aj] of Uj in 1r1(S1) vanishes, i.e. if its 
winding number \·anishes. The clements [aJ J define a cochain with values in 
Z = 1r1 (5 1). It is a well known fact that this cochain is in fact a cocyclc. The 
obstruction to extending the nonvanishing vector field is the cohomology class 
of this cocycle in the relative cohomology H 2(5, as; Z). 
If the vector bundle over S is the normal bundle, then the relative normal 
Euler number is the relative cohomology class v E H 2 (52 • as: Z) evaluated 
on 5. In the case as = 0 the homology class v(S) is the obstruction to the 
existence of a nonvanishing vector field transversal to S. 
The relative first Chern class c(S) is defined similarly. Consider the prob-
lem of extending the tangent vector field T of as and the vector field N E TS 
which is outward transversal to T (and tangent to the surface) as C-linearly 
independent vector fields. Here the vector bundle is the complex tangent bun-
dle of ]1.[ pulled back to S via the embedding. Consider again a trivialization 
uj X C 2 of the bundle in a neighbourhood of tJ.j. The mapping C>j from [)tJ.j 
to the pairs of complex linearly independent vector fields can be considered as 
a mapping 
ai : atJ.i--> GL(2, C). 
Since GL(2, C) retracts onto U(2), the homotopy class [aj] of Uj in 7rt(U(2)) = 
Z will have to vanish if an extension to tJ.j be possible. Again it can be shown 
that [aj] is a cocycle with values in Z. 
By definition. the relative first Chern class c is the relative cohomology 
class of this cocycle. Thus cis an element of H 2(S, 85; Z). 
Theorem 8.35 ([52]) Let S be an oriented compact surface embedded in a 4-
manifold with a complex structure J such that the points of complex tangency 

8.5 Two-dimensional surfaces in contact manifolds

are isolated elliptic or hyperbolic points, with no complex tangencies on as. 
Then with the above definitions of v and c, 
v(S) = -x(S) + e+ + e_- h+- h_ = -x(S) + d+ + rL 
and 
c(S) = d+- d_. 
The BiHhop equality 
1 
d± = 2(x(S) + v(S) ± c(S)) 
is an immediate consequence of theHe formulaH. 
Proof. Extend T from as to S as a tangent vector field (still called T) with 
singularities at isolated points Qj, which arc not points of complex tangency. 
Then 
L indexq, T = x(S). 
The vector field iT iH transvcn;e to S outside the points Qj and outside 
the complex tangencies Pi. The index of iT at points Qj is 
indexq1 iT = - index q, T 
and at the points of complex tangency 
indexp1 iT = ± 1 
depending on whether Pj is an elliptic ( + 1) or a hyperbolic ( -1) point. Thus

Bennequin's inequality 
Benncquin shows [11. p. lc!7] that for the standard structure ~~) on s<; the 
inequality 
l(DS) S -x(S) 
holds whenever Sis an immersed surface with an embedded transversal boudary 
as. If as is a Legendre boundary, then this result in combination with the 
equality 
1(.\±) = tb(.\) ± r·(.\) 
(see section 8 .. 5.2) shows that 
tb(aS) S -x(S) ± r(aS). 
From thi;,; inequality Bcnnequin deduces that the standard structnrc ist tight, 
i.e. the characterbtic foliation of embedded discs cannot have dosed integral 
curves avoiding the singular points. 
The argument is the following: Assume that S is an cmhcddccl disc with 
Legcndrian boundary and such that there arc no singular points on as. There 
exists then a vector field X along DS which is transversal to ~0 and tangent to 
S. The inter;;cction number of the curve .\ + = as+ EX with s will then be 
zero, since x+ will not mc·et S, therefore tb(DS) = 0. On the other hand, the 
inequality shows that 
tb(CJS) S -x(S)- ir(aS)I < 0. 
w:1ich clearly is a contradiction. 
In [32] Eliashberg showed that Bennequin's inequality holds for arbitrary 
tight structures. We will give a sketch of the proof for Eliashberg's result. The 
fact th<1t the standard ~tructure ~0 on 5 3 is tight (Bcnnequin's theorem) will 
be obtained as a corollary to the theorem of Eliashberg and Gromov, which 
states that all fillablc st.ruC'tmcs are tight (sec section 8.6.3). 
Theorem 8.36 ([32]). Assume that 1 i8 a transversal curve homological to 
zcm in a tight contact manifold (AI,~). Then for every embedded surfaceS 
with bo11ndary 1 
l(r) ::::; -x(S) 
(S represents a homology class Jl E H2(Jif,1) and l depends on Jl). 
Corollary 8.37 For an embedded disc S in a tight manifold with a Legendre 
boundary DS avoiding the singular points the inequality 
tb(CJS) S -x(S) -ir·(aS)I 
holds. 

206

Proof of the corollary. Take a vector field X along as which is transversal 
to ~ and tangmt to S. The curve 1± = as± eX is (negatively respectively 
positively) transversal aud by Bcnncquin's theorem 8.31 
tb(aS) ± r(aS) =I(!±)::; -:x(S).

The proof of the theorem given by [31] consists in showing that negative 
elliptic points of S can be cancelled via a small perturbation "·ith (negative) 
hyperbolic points. This shows that d_ ::; 0. From Bcnncquin's theorem we have 
l(aS) = -d+ + fL 
and consequently 
l(aS) ::; -d+- d_ = -x(S). 
The deformation argument, which permits cancellation. is based on the 
elimination lemma 8.26. Eliashbcrg introduces the notion of a Legcndrian poly-
gun (roughly an immersed surface with piecewise Lcgcndrian boundary and 
singularities at the vertices). After a small deformation, the basin of attraction 
B(p) of an elliptic point is a Lcgcndrian polygon. There must be a negative 
hyperbolic poiul on aB(p), otherwise all the positive hyperbolic points coulJ 
be cancelled leaving an embedded elise with a Legcndrian boundary. But this 
is impossible since the contact structure is tight. 
Let us observe that d_ ::; 0 generally only holds for embedded and not 
for immersed surfaces. An example is given by Benncquin ([11. p. 135]). The 
present proof therefore cannot be used for immersed surfaces.

Bishop's theorem 
Consider a manifold S of real dimension two embedded in C2 . A point p E S 
is a complex tangency, if TpS is a complex subspace of C 2 . The embedded 
manifold S is completely real, if there arc no complex tangcncies. Generically, 
complex tangcncies arc isolated, they arc either elliptic or hyperbolic (see be-
low). If the manifold S is oriented, then a complex tangency is positive or 
negative according to whether the orientation of TpS agrees or disagrees with 
the orientation induced from C2 . Generically, in a neighbourhood of a complex 
tangency p holomorphic coordinates (w, z) can be introduced such that ncar p 
the manifold S is represented as the graph of 
z = ww + 2;JRew2 + O(w3 ) 
with 0 ::; iJ < ! in the elliptic and ! < iJ < oo in the hyperbolic case. In a 
generic situation. the parabolic case iJ = ! will not occur. 

8.6 Holomorphic filling 
207 
The representation of S is obtained as follows: By a C-linear change of 
coordinates in C 2 it may be achieved that p = ( 0. 0) and Tp = { z = 0}, such 
that locally S is given by 
z = mv2 +/'lui+ 11dn + O(u·3 ). 
If we make the generic assumption 1 f' 0, we can replace z by z/1 to obtain 
z = uw2 + /Jui + ww + O(w3 ). 
Choose iJ so that (3e- 2w 2': 0 and replace w by wei 0 to arrive at /3 2': 0. Finally 
substitute z by z + ( u - i3)w2 tu get 
z = -(u- (3)w2 + uw2 + (3w2 + ww + O(u/1) = (3(u· 2 + w2 ) + ww + O(w3 ). 
This shows that locally S can be represented as the graph of 
z = ww + 2/3Rew2 + O(w3 ) 
with 0 :::; !3 < oo. 
Theorem 8.38 (Bishop [13]) Let p be an elliptic tangency of a 2-dima mani-
folds embedded in C 2 . Then there exists a continuous family (We, Ze) : D --+ C 2 
of holomorphic discs with boundaries in S and such that their boundaries fill a 
neighbourhood of p inS. (The family depends on the real parameter e.) 
Proof. Set Q( w) = ww + 2(3Rc w 2 and consider the normalized Riemannian 
mapping 
er:D-+{Q<k} 
e>O 
between the disc D = {1(1 < 1} and the ellipse {Q < k}. We normalize by 
r(O) = 0, r'(O) = 1 (sec Figure 9). 
For sufficiently small parameters e > 0, a holomorphic disc (We, Ze) : D --+ 
C with boundary inS will be constructed. In the first approximation We = er. 
Fix e > 0 and set ( w, z) = (We, Ze). The function u· will be of the form 
w(() = er(() + (!(() 
with f holomorphic in D, continuous in I5 and f(O) = J'(O) = 0. If we let g be 
the local representation for S: 
g(w) = ww + 2,BRew2 + >.(w). 
then the crucial condition for the determination of z(() is that g(w(()) re-

The Hilbert transform T defined for functions on aD maps the boundary 
values uiav of the real part u of a holomorphic function u+it· onto the boundary 
values vlav of the imaginary part and is normalized by Tl = 0. The function 
defined on aD is the boundary value of a holomorphic function on D. The 
condition for g( w( ()) can therefore be restated as: 
must be the boundary value of a holomorphic function. Since the right hand 
side is real, it must be constant. For the function restricted to aD this means 
2eRe[f(2,6r( + 7()] = C- Q((f)- (>.1 + T>.2). 
The winding number of the image of 8D under the mapping 23r( + 7( is zero, 
since 2,6 < 1. There exists therefore a holomorphic function 1 with 
arg 1lav = arg(2,6r( + 7()iav

8.6.2 
One-parameter families of holomorphic discs 
Let S be a sphere embedded in a symplectic manifold (AL.v) with a compati-
ble complex structure J. We consider the problem of finding a 3-dimensional 
ball B such that B is foliated by holomorphic discs whose boundaries fill up 
s· = s \ {points of complex tangency}. 
The theorem of Bedford and Gaveau deals with the situation that a holo-
morphic dbc f: D ~ M with f(8D) c S* is prescribed. The assertion then is 
that there is a whole family of holomorphic discs close to f whose boundaries 
foliate a neighbourhood of f(8D) inS*. Bedfonl and Gaveau [9] proved the the-
orem in the context of holomorphic embeddings into C 2 (with standard struc-
ture·). the surface S being a graph in a strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface in C 2 . 
Hofer [55] extended this theorem to the present more general situation. 
Previously some general variants of the theorem were stated by [50] and [30]. 
In Hofer's version the surface S is still embedded in a contact manifold Af 
which itself is naturally embedded in its symplectification W = R x M. Yet the 
complex structure which goes with it is in general not integrable and the surface 
S is not necessarily a graph in the contact manifold AI. As it turns out, the 
prescribed surface S can be any compact orientable 2-dimensional completely 
real surface embedded in a 4-dimensional symplectic mllnifold (W,w) with a 
compatible complex structure J, such that the boundary Df D of the initial 
holomorphic disc will not meet the boundary of S. Note. however. that the 
index hypothesis formulated below will further restrict the situation. 
Let f: fJ-> ll" be an embedded holomorphic disc with f(8D) contained 
in the completely real compact surface S c W, f(8D) n 8S = 0. Then over 
the boundary 8D the pullback bundle (f]DD )*TS is a totally real sub bundle of 
(f]uD)*TW. Via a trivialization 'l/;: f*TW-> DxC2 the subbundle (f]DD)*TS 
determines a closed curve L : S 1 -> G2 2 in the Grassmann manifold G2 2 of 
2-dimensional oriented real subspaces ~f C 2 • The index inc! (f. S) of f ~ith 
respect to S is defined to be the Maslov index of L. To be more explicit, take 
the tangent vector field T along f(8D) and choose a vector field V E TS, 
defined along f(8D). such that T 1\ V determines the orientation of S. Then 
via the trivialization t' the pair (T, V) describes an clement of 1r1 ( G L(2, C)) and 
the index off is the clement in Z under the isomorphism 1r1(GL(2,C)) ~ Z. 
The index inc! (!, S) is independent of the choice of the trivialization 'lj;. 
For p E (2. oc) denote by B the Banach manifold of all mappings f E 
H 1·P (D, l-V) with f(oD) c S. Let LP(f) = LP(f*TW) be the space of all LP-
sections along f. Then as in chapter 6, [ = U fEB {!} x LP(f) is a Banach 
space bundle over B and the 8-mapping associated with the complex structure 
Jon W 
a: f,..... fx + J(f)fy 
is a section of [over B. (For the disc D = {]z] < 1} the parameter z = x + iy 
is used).

disc {tJuo = 0 on D) and uo(DD) C S\DS. where Sis an embedded completely

Remark. In [56] the definition of the index is based on the Grassmannian of 
unoricntcd 2-plancs, whereas the index used here comes from the Grassmannian 
of oriented 2-plancs. The two indices differ by a factor of 2. 
Proof. There exists a smooth chart a : U ---> C 2 defined in a neighbourhood of 
uo(D) such that 
a o uo(z) = (z,O), 
zED 
and the tangent mapping T a satisfies 
Tao]=iTa 
at all points ·uo(z), zED. The second equation says that along uo the complex 
structure J pulls back to the standard structure on C 2 . vVithin the disc jj = 
D x {0} this can be achieved, since u0 is holomorphic. The mapping a- 1 has 
then to be adjusted such that the tangent vectors (0.1) and (0, i) E T(z,a)C2 
at points (z,O) ED x {0} arc mapped onto vectors in Tuo(z)l-V satisfying 
Denote by J the pull back under a- 1 of the complex structure J 
J =Tao J o Ta- 1 
and by S the image of S n U under a. The index of u0 is then given as the 
index 
ind(uo, S) 
of the closed curve eiiJ >-> T(e'" ,o)S of real planes in C 2 . 
It must be shown that there exists a smooth family ao<.p : ( -E, E) x D ---> C 2 
of J-holomorphic mappings with boundary values in S. The mapping u : D---> 
C 2 is J-holomorphic if 
Ux + }(u)uy = 0. 
The linearization of this equation at u = (id, D) =a o u0 is then obtained 
in the following standard fashion:

Sis completely real and T(z,o)S contains the tangent vector X:= (iz,O). 
Suppose Y is a Ycctor field along DD such that X and Y span T(z,o)S at every 
point z E DD. Since T(z,o)S is completely real, the second component pr2Y of 
the vector field Y never vanishes. The assumption ind (u0 , S) = 1 is equivalent 
to the statement that the winding number of pr2Y: DD--. Cis zero.

For 2 < p < oo, \·1 is a Banach space. To continue the proof, we now make 
use of the following theorem of Hofer [56]. 
Theorem 8.40 Assume that (iz,O) E f(z) for all z E aD and indf = 1. 
Then the solution set L C Vf of the partial differential equation

Note that Lz describes the Lie algebra of the Mobius group PSL(2, R) acting 
on the unit disc. According to the theorem, ko(z) =I 0 in all of D. 
We now identify vector fields in a neighbourhood U of the zero section 
in TC 2 with mappings C 2 --> C 2 . As an identification mapping 1/J : U --> C 2 
choose a smooth mapping such that its restriction '1/Jx to Ux (the fiber at x 
intersected with U) is an embedding with 
1/J:r(O) = x, Ttf!x(O) = id

Here r is a real parameter and tlr a "small" vector field. This vector field is

for all lrl < c there exists a unique tlT E n2<p<x vi such that

In addition, .1. is a smooth map (-c,c)--> VJ (2 < p < XJ) with .1.0 = 0 and 
%rtlrlr=D = 0. By elliptic regularity theory, .1. is C""-smooth if, as we assume, 
the complex structure J and the surfaceS arc C""-smooth. Since k0(z) =I 0 for 
all zED we conclude that rp(r,z) = u-1ur(z) is an embedding (possibly after 
rcstriding the parameter domain for r), satisfies rp(O. z) = uo(z) and solves

symplectic 4-manifold (O,w) with complex structure J tamed by w. 
We shall usually assume that 0 is a domain contained in a bigger sym-
plectic manifold (Hr, w) and that J is defined in all of lV. Recall that J is tamed 
by w if w(X, J X) > 0 for all tangent vectors X =I 0. It is not assumed that w 
be J-invariant.

contact manifolds. According to proposition 8.14, the hypersurfaces of contact 
type M = on, with n a domain with compact closure in a symplectic manifold 
can be equipped with a holomorphically tillable contact structure. In contrast 
to these examples, note that though symplcctification yields an embedding of 
( M, 0 into a symplectic manifold W = M x R, the manifold M docs not appear 
as the boundary of a bounded domain in W. 
Throughout this section, (M, ~) will be a holomorphically fillablc contact 
manifold. Our main aim is to discuss the proof of the following theorem due to 
Gromov [50], sec also Eliashbcrg [27]. 
Theorem 8.42 Holomorphically fillable contact structures are tight. 
Corollary 8.43 The standard structure ~0 on the sphere 5 3 is tight. 
This is a fundamental result of Benncquin [11, Corollairc 2, p. 150]. The 
proof given by Bcnncquin uses his famous inequalities (see section 8.5.4 for a 
detailed discussion). 
The scheme of the proof is the following: Assume that the manifold (M, ~) 
is overtwisted. Then there exists an embedded disc D with an elliptic singular 
point p ED such that its boundary aD is an embedded Legendrian curve and 
such that there are no singular points on [) apart from p. According to [27, 
p. 45] (bee also [28, p.629]) a neighbourhood U of D can then be chosen such 
that s = au is homeomorphic to the sphere and its characteristic foliation 
has exactly two singular points P± which are elliptic and of opposite sign. 
FurthermorP the foliation has two limit cycles. 
Use then that (A'!, 0 is holomorphicaly fillable in order to construct a 
family It, t E ( -1, 1), of holomorphic discs It : (~,a~) -> (n, S), which fill S. 
(Here ~ c C denotes the unit disk.) This means that 
l:(-1,1)x3.->0 
is an embedding. ftlt> is holomorphic, lim ft = P± and the curves f 1(8D), 
t~±l 
t E (-1,1), foliateS\ {p+,P-}. 
Now M is a J-ronvex manifold. Holomorphic discs It : (~, 8~)-> (n, S) 
will not touch M at an interior point nor will the tangent plane to the disc at 
a boundary point coincide with a contact plane~ in Af (the holomorphic discs 
intersect Af = an transversally). Therefore the characteristic foliation M of S 
has to be transversal to the foliation ft(o~), t E ( -1, 1). But this is impossible 
if the characteristic foliation J1, has limit cycles. This contradiction shows that 
there are no embedded overtwisted discs in AI. The contact structure is tight. 
The method of filling by holomorphic discs was developped by Bedford and 
Gaveau in the classical setting. They showed that a surface S which appears as 
a graph in the boundary of a strictly pseudoconvex domain in C 2 can always 

8.6 Holomorphic filling 
215 
be filled by holomorphic discs, provided it contains only two elliptic singular 
points of opposite sign. The compactness argument of Bedford and Gavcau 
was based on a priori estimates. In the general case of a nonintegrablc complex 
structure, compactness will be a consequence of Gromov's theorem (~cc below). 
The method has been devcloppcd further by Bedford and Klingenberg [10], who 
showed that holomorphic filling is also possible in the presence of hyperbolic 
singularities. 
In the nonintcgrable case the theorem on filling by holomorphic discs ami 
its applications arc due to Gromov [50] and Eliashberg [31] and [35]. 
Theorem 8.44 Assume that S is a 2-sphere embedded in a holomorphically 
fillable contact manifold M = an such that S has exactly two singular points 
P+ and P- {which necessarily are elliptic and of opposite sign). If the complex 
structure J is integrable near the singular points, then S admits a filling 
f:(-1,1)xLS.-d1 
by holomorphic discs: f is an embedding, ft = f(t, ·) is holomorphic in ll. for 
all t, the curves ft(aD) foliateS and lim ft = P±·

The theorem should be true without the additional hypothesis that J is 
integrable ncar the singular points. However, so far all efforts to generalize 
Bishop's theorem to the nonintcgrablc case failed. Up to some modifications 
our proof follows Eliashberg's reasoning in [35]. 
By Bishop's theorem (section 8.6.1) there exist families of embedded holo-
morphic discs ft and g8 
: (ll., all.) --> (!1, S), t E ( -1,-1 + c:), s E (1- c:, 1) 
with lim g. = P+ and lim ft = P-· Observe that the index ind Ut. S) for the 
s-1 
t---1 
discs in Bishop's family is equal to 1. 
If fto 
: (ll., all.) 
--> (!1, S) is an embedded holomorphic disc with 
ind (!10 , S) = 1, then by the implicit function theorem in Hofer's setting (Theo-
rem 8.39) there exists an open interval I 3 t0 and an embedding <p : I x LS. --> !1 
such that for all t E I, <p1(ll.) is a holomorphic disc with boundary in S. Fur-
thermore, <pis uniquely determined. This shows that the Bishop family starting 
at say -1 can be uniquely continued. 
Next apply Gromov's compactness theorem for families of holomorphic 
discs with boundaries inS\ {P+,P-}. (See [112] for a thorough discussion). 
In the generic case (and the complex structure allows for slight deformations 
off the surface S) bubbling off cannot occur in the interior of the discs. That 
bubbles cannot split off the boundaries is due to the fact that f 1(all.) always 
has to be transversal to the characteristic foliation. 
As a result, the family of holomorphic discs starting at -1 can be continued 
until at some point to the holomorphic disc fto hits a holomorphic disc, say g8 
from the Bishop family starting at P+. In this case, fto will have to coincide with 
g. and the family of holomorphic discs extends to a filling of S. The argument 

216 
8 Contact structures 
that upon touching, fto and g, have to coincide is of a subtle nature. That the 
surfaces cannot touch at an interior point follows from results of [75]. A proof 
for the fact that they cannot touch at boundary points is given by Eliashberg 
[35, prop. 2.2.A]. In the present situation, it should also be possible to adapt 
the proof of Bedford and Gaveau, since the touching would occur in a region 
where by hypothesis the complex structure is integrable. 
Let us now show how the theorem of filling by holomorphic discs can he 
applied. Assume that p is an elliptic singular point on the 2-dimensional suface 
S embedded in the contact manifold "U = Dn. Ncar J1 the complex structure J 
can be changed into an integrable one which is still tamed by ""' an(] such that 
the characteristic foliation iJ on S is unchanged. For the proof of this statement, 
consider the standard Heisenberg structure on the contact manifold H = DD 
It is described by the form 
I3y Darhoux' theorem there exists a contact mapping rp : U --+ H defined in a 
neighbourhood U of p with rp(Jl) = 0. The tangent mapping :;;. restricted to 
~ at p will in ge1wral not he complex linear, but :;; can be composed with a 
contact transform A : H--+ H such that at p, (A o rp). IE is complex linear. (A 
can be chosen as a quasiconfonnal mapping with constant complex dilation). 
Choose next an extension rp of the contact mapping A o rp to a neighbourhood 
of p in n su,~h that at the point p the tangent mapping is holomorphic. 
Jorp.(p) = rp.(p)J, 
where .!0 is the standard complex structure in C 2 The pullback structure 
} = <p,;- 1 .!0 rp. then defines an integrable structure in a neighbourhood of p E 0 
with }(p) = J(p) and the contact structure~ induced by J is unchanged. The 
symplectic form c..• is tamed by J and therefore by all complex structures suffi-
ciently C 0-closc to J. The new complex structure can thus be chosen equal to 
J in a neighbourhood of p and equal to J outside a slightly bigger neighbour-
hood. At intermediate points interpolate between the two complex structures 
such that ~ remains a complex invariant subspace. 
The previous argument which showed that holomorphically fillablc contact 
structures arc tight used the method of filling by holomorphic discs. \Vc just 
showed that the additional hypothesis on integrability of the complex structure 
which appears in the theorem on filling by holomorphic discs can be dealt with. 

8. 7 Eliasllbcrg's classiflcation of 3-dimcnsiorwl contact structures 
217 
8. 7 
Eliashberg's classification of 3-dimensional 
contact structures 
In 1989 Eliashbcrg [28] classified ovcrtwistcd contact structures on compact 
3-manifolds and in 1992 he showed [33] that the standard structure is the only 
tight structure on 5~ (up to isotopies). For general compact 3-manifolds the 
classification problem for tight structures remains largely open. The classifica-
tion for contact structures on R:1 was completed in 1993 [34]. 
Let 11s state (without proof) the relevant theorems: 
Theorem 8.45 ([28]) The classification of overtwisted oriented contact struc-
tures on a compact 3-manifold up to isotopy (fixed near the boundary 81\J) 
coincides with the homotopy (rei 81\1) classification of oriented tangent plane 
fields. 
As we have observed in section 8.4.1, the homotopy classification of ori-
ented tangent plane fields on 5 3 is given by 7r3 (52 ) ~ Z. In every homotopy 
class [ok]. k E Z, of oriented tangent plane fields on 5 3 . there exists thus up to 
isotopics exactly one positive (and one negative) OYertwistcd contact structure 
(k,k E Z. 
Theorem 8.46 ([33]) Any tight positive contact structure on 5 3 is isotopic to 
the standard contact structure ~0 . 
In the homotopy class [no] of oriented tangent plane fields on 5 3 there 
exist therefore (up to isotopics) exactly two positive contact structures, the 
tight ( ~o) and the overtwistcd ( (o). 
Theorem 8.47 ([33]) The space of tight contact structures on 5 3 fixed at a 
point p E 5 3 is contractible. 
From this it can be derived that any contact transformation h : 5 3 __, 5 3 
(with respect to the standard structure ~0 ) arises as the time-one map h1 of a 
flow ht. t E [0, 1], of contact transformations with h0 = id. 
According to a result of Cerf (see [17] and the discussion in [33]) a flow 
ft of diffeomorphisms of 53 exists with fo = id and h = h. It can be assumed 
that h and ft. t E [0, 1], fix the contact structure .;0 at a point p E 5 3 . Apply 
then the contraction mapping 'Ps from the theorem to the pullback structures 
~~ = ft • .;o (with 6 = ~o). The contraction 'Ps will then map ~~ along a path 
<p s ( ~~), 0 ::; s ::; so, to the standard structure ~o and -,; 8 ( ~~) depends smoothly 
on t and s. According to Gray's theorem 8.2 there exist mappings 9t with 
9t• ~0 = .;1. Observe that the construction of these mappings can be normalized 
such that the mappings g1 themselves are uniquely determined by the paths 
'Ps (~t). They will depend smoothly on t and g1 = id if 'Ps (~t) = ~o- Therefore 
ht = g! 1 o ft is a contact flow with ho = id, h1 =h. 

218 
8 Contact structures 
The contact flow h1 extends to a symplectic flow of ( B, w). where w is the 
SU(2, !)-invariant Kahler form on the ball B. 
Eliashberg's proof of the previous theorem (and of Cerf's theorem) actually 
goes the other way around. Using the method of filling by holomorphic discs, he 
shows ([33, Lemma 6.2]) that any contact automorphism h of (S3 ,_;0 ) extends 
as a diffeomorphism to all of B. In combination with Theorem 8.2 this then 
also gives a proof of Cerf's theorem. 

A 
Generalities on Homology and Cohomology 
This ~cction ~hould be skipped by the reader familiar with the subject. For 
reference we will just summarize the main properties without motivation and 
proof. The reader is referred to the extensive literature on algebraic topology, 
e.g. [23], [97]. Homology and cohomology are functors, ways of converting topo-
logical problems into algebraic ones. They assign abelian groups to topological 
spaces and homomorphisms to continuous maps of one space to another. The 
main properties of these functors arc summarized by the Eilenherg-Steenrod 
axioms, which will be listed below. 
A pair of spaces (X, A) is a topological space X together with a subset 
A<;;; X with the relative topology. A map f: (X, A) ~ (Y, B) is a continuous 
map f : X --> Y such that f(A) <;;; B. It is customary to abbreviate (X, 0) by 
(X) or just X. 
Definition. A family of pairs of spaces and maps of such pairs is called an 
admissible category for homology theory if it satisfies the following five comli-
tions. 
(1) If (X, A) E A then all pairs and inclu~ion maps in the following diagram, 
called the lattice of (X, A) 
(X,0) 
/ 
(0, 0) __. (A, 0) 
(X, A) -> (X, X) 
/ 
(A, A) 
arc in A. 
(2) Iff : (X, A) --> (Y, B) is in A, then (X, A) and (Y, B) are in A together with 
all maps that f defines of members of the lattice of (X, A) to corresponding 
members of the lattice of (Y, B). 
(3) Whenever the composition of two maps in A is defined, it is in A. 
(4) If I = [0, 1] and (X, A) E A, then the cartesian product (X, A) x I 
(X x I, A x I) is in A and the maps 
90.91: (X, A)__. (X, A) X I 
defined by go(x) = (x,O), gl(x) = (x, 1) are in A. 
(5) A contains a space P0 consisting of a single point. If X, PEA, I: P __.X 
and Pis a single point, then IE A. 
Examples of admissible categories are: 
A1 = all pairs (X, A) and all maps of such pairs. This is the largest 
admissible category. 

220 
A Generalities on Homology and Cohomology 
Ac = all pairs (X, A) with X compact, A closed in X, and all maps of 
such pairs. 
Ale= all pairs (X, A) where X is a locally compact Hausdorff space, A is 
closed in X, and all proper maps of such pairs. 
A.l 
Axioms for homology 
A homology theory on an admissible category A consists of three kinds of 
objects. 
(1) an R-modulc Hk(X, A) for every pair (X, A) E A and every integer k ~ 0. 
It is called the k-dimensional relative homology group of X modulo A. Here, R 
is a commutative ring with a unit clement. When one wants to specify R one 
speaks of homology with coefficients in R. 
(2) For each map f : (X, A) -> (Y, B) in A and each nonnegative integer k, a 
homomorphism 
f. : Hk(X, A) -> Hk(Y, B), 
called the homomorphism induced by f. 
(3) For each (X, A) E A and each nonnegative integer k, a homomorphism 
8: Hk(X,A) _, H~.:-t(A), 
called the boundary opemtor, where by definition H_ 1(A) = 0. 
The following arc the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms which must be fulfilled 
for a homology theory. 
Axiom 1. If f = identity, then f. = identity. 
Axiom 2. (gf). =g. f •. 
Axiom 3. Df. = (JI.-1.).8, i.e. the diagram 
commutes.

Axiom 4. (Exactness axiom) If (X, A) is admissible and i :A<--> X, j :X<--> 
(X, A) arc inclusion maps, then the sequence, called the homology sequence of 
(X, A), 
... Hk(A) ~ Hk(X) 4 Hk(X, A) ~ Hk-! (A) ~ ... 4 H0(X. A) ~ 0 
is exact. 
Axiom 5. (Homotopy axiom) If the admissible maps f, g : (X. A) -> (Y, B) 
are homotopic in A. then for all k the homomorphisms f.,g. : Hk(X,A)-> 
Hk(Y, B) coincide. 

A.2 Axioms for cohomology 
221 
Axiom 6. (Excision axiom) If U C X is open, 0 C int A and the inclusion 
map (X\ U, A\ U) '-' (X, A) is admissible, then it induces isomorphisms 
Hk(X \ U. A\ U) ~ Hk(X,A) for all k. 
Axiom 7. (Dimension axiom) If Pis an admissible space consisting of a single 
point, then Hk(P) = 0 for k # 0. 
The axioms arc consistent since they arc satisfied if Hk(X, A) = 0 V k. To 
proof the existence of nontrivial homologies one has to actually construct some 
homology. like the singular, Ccch, etc. 
Axioms 5 and 6 have the following equivalent versions. 
Axiom 5'. If (X, A) is admissible and f, g : (X, A) -+ (X, A) x I arc defined 
by f(x) = (x,O), g(x) = (x, 1), then f.= g •. 
Axiom 6'. If X = intXi U intX2 for subsets Xi and X2 of X, Xi closed 
and the inclusion i : (Xi, Xi n X2) '-' (X, X2) is admissible, then it induces 
isomorphisms i. : Hk(Xi, Xi n X2) ~ Hk(X, X2) for each k. 
A.2 
Axioms for cohomology 
In going from homology to cohomology, Hk(X, A) is replaced by Hk(X, A) 
which is again an R-module, f. : Hk(X, A) -+ Hk(Y, B) is replaced by the 
homomorphism f* : Hk(Y, B)-+ Hk(X, A) and{) is replaced by the homomor-
phism /5: Hk-i(A)-+ Hk(X, A), the coboundary operator. 
Axiom lc. If f = identity, then f* = identity. 
Axiom 2c. (g!)* = f*g*. 
Axiom 3c. b(!IA)* = f*/5. 
Axiom 4c. If i : A '-' X and j : X <-> (X, A) arc admissible maps, then the 
cohomology sequence of (X, A) 
is exact. 
Axiom 5c. If f,g: (X,A)-+ (Y,B) are homotopic (and admissible), then 
f* = g*. 
Axiom 6c. If U is open in X, 0 C int A and the inclusion map i : (X \ 
U,A \ U) '-'(X, A) is admissible, then it induces isomorphisms Hk(X,A) ~ 
Hk(X \ U,A \ U). 
Axiom 7 c. If the admissible space P consists of a single point, thm Hk ( P) = 0 
fork# 0. 
If the ring R equals Z, then homology and cohomology are dual: Letting 
Hk(X, A) be the character group of Hk(X, A) and f., 8 the homomorphisms 
dual to f*. 8 yields a system satisfying axioms 1 to 7. The dual of each theorem 

222 
A Generalities on Homology and Cohomology 
about { Hk, f., a} is a true theorem about { Hk, f*, 8}. Passing from a theorem 
to its dual reverses anows, replaces subgroups by factor groups and vice versa. 
For a general ring with unit there is only a partial duality. The dual of 
each theorem on homology is true for cohomology in general only as far as tlw 
additive structure of the R-modules Hk(X, A) is concerned. 
A.3 
Homomorphisms of (co )homology sequences 
A map f: (X, A) ..... (Y,B) defines maps 
/! : X --. Y, 
h = (fdA) :A--. B. 
The collection of induced homomorphisms f.,/!., h. will be called f ••. It forms 
a homomorphism of the homology sequence of (X, A) into that of (Y, B), i.e. 
the following diagram commutes: 
i. 
Hk(X) 
j. 
Hk(X.A)--+ 
--> 
--> 
ih. 
if. 
., 
j: 
'· 
Hk(Y) 
Hk(Y,B)--. 
--> 
--> 
This follows immediately from axioms 2 and 3. For cohomology there is an 
analogous homomorphism f** of cohomology sequences. 
Theorem A.l ([23. Thm. 4.2]) Let f : (X, A) --> (Y, B) be admissible. If 
h. : Hk(X) --. Hk(Y) and h. : Hk(A) --> Hk(B) are isomorphisms for all k, 
then so are f. : Hk(X, A)--+ Hk(Y, B) and f •• is an isomorphism. 
The dual theorem for cohomology is true, too. 
A.4 
The (co)homology sequence of a triple 
Suppose B ~ A ~ X and the inclusions 
i : (A, B) '--' (X, B), 
j : (X, B) '--' (X, A) 
are admissible. Then (X, A, B) is called an admissible triple. Let j' : A <--+ 
(A, B) be the inclusion, a : Hk(X, A) --. Hk-l (A) the boundary operator and 
8: Hk- 1(A)--+ Hk(X.A) the coboundary operator. 
Definition. The boundary operator of the triple (X, A, B) is the homomor-
phism 
a: Hk(X,A)--. Hk-l(A,B) 
defined by a = j~ a. The coboundary operator for the tr·iple (X. A, B) is the 
homomorphism 
defined by 8 = 8 j'*. 

A.4 The (co)lwmology sequence of a triple 
223 
Theorem A.2 ([23, Thms. 10.2, l0.2c]) The homomology sequence of the 
triple (X. A, B) 
... __, Hk(A.. B).'..:. HI.:( X, B)~ Hk(X, A)-'!.. fh_t(A., B)_, ... 
and the cohomology sequence of the triple (X. A. B) 
are both exact. 
Note that when B = 0 tlwse sequences arc just those fln· the pair (X, A) 
from axiom;; 4 and 4c. 
A map f : (X', A', B') ~ (X, A, B) of one triple into anoth(T is a map of 
X 1 into X carrying A.' into A and B' into B. It is called admissible if the map;; 
ft :(X', A')_, (X, A). h: (A'. B') _,(A, B). h: (X', B') __,(X, B) 
defined by f arc admissible. 
By axioms 2 and 3, an admissible map f: (X',A',B') __, (X.A.B) in-
duces a homomorphism of the homology sequence of (X', A', B') into that of 
(X, A, B). i.e. the diagram

quence of (X, A. B) into that of (X', A', B'). 
Proposition A.3 ([23, Thrn. 10.4]) If B i 0 and (X, A, B) is an admissible 
triple, then the following equivalences hold. 
Hk(X,A.) = OVk

Corresponding equivalences hold joT cohomology. 
Proposition A.4 ([23, Thm. 10.5]) Let (X, A., B) be an admissible tTiple. If 
B "--' A induces isamoTphisms lh(B) ~ Hk(A) V k, then (X, B) "--' (X, A)

phisms Hk(A.) ~ Hk(X) V k, then (A, B) <-+ (X, B) induces isomoTphisms 
Hk(A., B)~ Hk(X, B) V k. The analogs joT cohomology hold.

A Generalities on Homology and Colwmology 
A.5 
Homotopy equivalence and contractibility 
All pairs, maps and homotopics will be assumed to be admissible. 
Definition. Two pairs (X, A) and (Y, B) arc homotopically equivalent (in A) 
if there exist maps 
f : (X, A) ---+ (Y, B), 
g: (Y,B)---+ (X, A) 
such that g f is homotopic to the identity map of (X, A) and f g is homotopic 
to the identity map of (Y, B). The pair of maps f, g (or just one of them) is 
called a homotopy equivalence. f and g arc called homotopy inverses of each 
other. 
By the homotopy axiom, homotopically equivalent spaces have the same 
homology and cohomology: 
Proposition A.5 A homotopy equivalence f : (X, A) ---+ (Y, B) induces iso-
morphisms f. : Hk(X, A) 8" Hk(Y, B) for all k and an isomorphism of the 
homology sequences of (X, A) and (Y, B). The analog for cohomology holds. 
Recall that by definition of an admissible category there exists an admis-
sible space P0 consisting of a single point. If the unique map f : X ---+ Po is 
admissible, then the kernel of f. : Ho(X) ---+ Ho(Po) is called the reduced 0-
dimensiunal homology group of X, and is denoted by Ho(X). The factor group 
of H 0 (X) modulo the image of j* : H 0 (P0 ) ---+ H 0 (X) is called the reduced 
0-dimensional cohomology group of X. 
If P consists of a single point, then H0(P) = H0(P) = 0. 
Definition. A space X is homologically trivial if Hk(X) = 0 for k =f. 0 and 
H0(X) = 0. If A =f. 0, the pair (X, A) is homologically trivial if Hk(X, A) = 0 
V k. The definitions for cohomology arc analogous. 
Proposition A.6 Every space contractible to a point over itself is (co}homo-
logically trivial. 
Definition. A pair (X', A') s;;; (X, A) is called a retract of (X, A) if there is a 
map f: (X, A)---+ (X',A') such that f(x) = x Vx EX'. It is a deformation 
retract if the composition off with the inclusion (X', A') '-+ (X. A) is homo-
topic to the identity map of (X, A). (Note that this definition depends on the 
category A.) 
Every deformation retract of (X, A) is homotopy equivalent to (X, A), 
since the retraction map and the inclusion map are homotopy inverses. 
Corollary A.7 If (X',A') is a deformation retract of (X, A), then the in-
clusion map (X', A') '-+ (X, A) induces isomorphisms of the (co}homology se-
quences. 

A.6 Direct sum:; 
225 
A.6 
Direct sums 
Assume X = X 1 U ... U X,. is the disjoint union of closed (hence open) subsets 
of X and A = A1 U ... U A,., where Am ~ X 111 for rn = 1, ... , n. Assume 
further all pairs and inclusions formed of the scb Xm. Am and their unions arc 
admissible. Let im : (Xm. Am) '--' (X, A) be the inclusion. 
Theorem A.8 ([23, Thm. 13.2]) The homomorphisms im• : Hk(X11, Am) -+ 
Hk(X, A) yield an injective representation of Hk(X. A) as a direct sum, i.e. 
each el E Hk(X, A) can be represented uniquely a.s el = 
L~t=l im•elm, where 
elm E Hk(Xm, Am). 
Theorem A.9 ([23, Thm. 13.2c]) The homomorphisms 
i;,. : Hk (X, A) -+ Hk(X11., A,) 
yield a projective representation of Hk(X, A) as a direct sum, i.e. for each 
sequence elm E Hk(Xm, Am) (m = 
1, ... , n) there is a unique element el E 
Hk(X, A) with i;n el =elm, form= 1, ... , n. 
A.7 
Triads 
A triad is a generalization of an admissible triple. 
Definition. A triad (X; X 1, X 2 ) consists of a space X and two subsets 
X1, X2 such that X, X1, X2, X1 UX2, X1 n X2 and all pairs and inclusion maps 
formed from these arc admissible. The triad (X; X 1• X2 ) is called proper with 
respect to (co)homology if the inclusions 
induce isomorphisms of the (co)homology groups in all dimensions. 
Note that the last condition depends on the homology theory. It is auto-
matically satisfied if xl ;;:> x2, i.e. every admissible triple is a proper triad. 
Theorem A.lO ([23, Thms. 14.2, 14.2c]) A triad (X:X1,X2 ) is proper with 
respect to homology if and only if the inclusions im : (X m, X 1 n X 2) '--' (X 1 U 
Xz,X1nX2) (m = 1, 2) yield for each k an injective representation of Hk(X1U 
X 2 , X 1 n Xz) as a direct sum. The analog for cohomology holds with 'injective' 
replaced by 'projective '. 
Definition. The boundary operator a: Hk(}(, X1 UX2)-+ Hk-1(X1, X1 nXz) 
of a proper triad (X; X1, Xz) is defined by a= k2} lz. a, where b : X1 UX2 '--' 
(X1 U X2. Xz) is the inclusion. (Note that a is the boundary operator of the 
triple (X. X1 U X2, X2) followed by an excision map.) The coboundary operator 
8: Hk-1(X1, X1 n X2)-+ Hk(X, X1 U X2) is defined by 8 = b 12 (k2)-1. 

226 
A Generalities on Homology and Cohomology 
Theorem A.ll ([23. Thms. 14.4, 14.4c]) The homology sequence of a proper 
triad (X; X1. X2) 
and its cohomology sequence 
are exact, where the unmarked arrows are induced by inclusions. 
Note that if XI ~ x2, then the (co)homology sequence of the triad 
(X;X 1,X2) reduces to that of the triple (X,Xt,X2)· As for triples, a map 
between proper triads induces a homomorphism between their corresponding 
(co) homology sequences. 
Theorem A.12 ([23, Thms. 14.6, 14.6c]) Let (X;X1,X2) be a proper triad 
with X= X1 U X2. If f, ft, h are maps (X, X1 n X2)---> (Y. B) such that 
then f. = ft. + h. and r = fi + f2.

Mayer-Vietoris sequence of a triad 
Theorem A.13 ([23, Thm. 15.3]) The Mayer-Vietoris sequence of a proper 
triad (X; X 1, X2) with X= X1 U X2 and A= X1 n X2, 
is exact. The maps 'lj!, <p, .6. are defined as follows

is a map of one proper triad into another. and X = X 1 U X 2 , Y = Y1 U Y2. then 
f induces a hom.ornorphism of the Mayer- Vidoris sequence of the first triad 
into that of the second and a hornorrwrphism of the Mayer- Vidoris cohomology 
sequence of the scrond triad into that of the first. 
In the gcncml case X ::; X 1 U X 2 there arc relative l\Iay0r-Vietoris se-
quences.

Progress in MaJhemaJics is a series of books intended for professional mathematicians and sci-
entists, encompassing all areas of pure mathematics. This distinguished series, which began in 
1979, includes authored monographs, and edited collections of papers on important research 
developments as well as expositions of particular subject areas. 
We encourage preparation of manuscripts in such form of TeX for delivery in camera-ready 
copy which leads to rapid publication, or in electronic form for interfacing with laser printers or 
typesetters. 
Proposals should be sent directly to the editors or to: Birkhauser Boston, 675 Massachusetts

Lectures in Mathematics 
ETH Ziirich 
Department of Mathematics, Research Institute of 
Mathematics 
Each year the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (ETH) 
at Zurich invites a selected group of mathematicians to give 
postgraduate seminars in various areas of pure and applied 
mathematics. These seminars are directed to an audience 
of many levels and backgrounds. Now some of the most 
successful lectures are being published for a wider au-
dience through the Lectures in Mathematics, ETH Zurich 
series. Lively and informal in style, moderate in size and 
price, these books will appeal to professionals and students 
alike, bringing a quick understanding of some important 
areas of current research.

The foundations of this outstanding book series were 
laid in 1944. Until the end of the 1970s, a total of 77 
volumes appeared, including works of such distin-
guished mathematicians as Caratheodory, Nevanlinna 
and Shafarevich. to name a few. The series came to 
its name and present appearance in the 1980s. Ac-
cording to its well-established tradition, only mono-
graphs of excellent quality will be published in this 
collection. Comprehensive, in-depth treatments of 
areas of current interest are presented to a reader-
ship ranging from graduate students to professional 
mathematicians. Concrete examples and applications 
both within and beyond the immediate domain of 
mathematics illustrate the import and consequences 
of the theory under discussion.
