Unitary Operator
Werner Stulpe
Unitary operator, a sharpening of the concept of an isometric operator. A linear
 operator J deﬁned on a complex (real) Banach space X ( Hilbert space) with
values in some complex (real) Banach space Y is called isometric or an isometry
if it preserves the norm, i.e., ∥Jφ∥= ∥φ∥for all φ ∈X. An isometric operator
is bounded ( operator) with norm ∥J∥= 1, invertible, and the range RJ is a
closed ( Hilbert space) submanifold of Y which is, even in the case Y = X, in
general smaller than Y (if X and Y have the same ﬁnite dimension, then RJ = Y).
The inverse operator J −1 is an isometry with domain DJ −1 = RJ and the range
RJ −1 = X. Two Banach spaces X and Y are called (norm-) isomorphic if there
exists an isometry from X to Y such that RJ = Y.
An isometric operator J deﬁned on a complex (real) Hilbert space H with values
in some complex (real) Hilbert space K automatically preserves the scalar products
also, i.e., ⟨Jφ|Jψ⟩= ⟨φ|ψ⟩for φ, ψ ∈H. Such an operator is called unitary [1–6]
if H and K are complex Hilbert spaces and if its range is K. That is, a linear operator
U from some complex Hilbert space H to some other complex Hilbert space K is
unitary if (i) DU = H, (ii) ⟨Uφ|Uψ⟩= ⟨φ|ψ⟩for φ, ψ ∈H, and (iii) RU = K.
The inverse U−1 is also unitary where, in the case of H = K, U−1 = U∗holds (the
assumption H = K is not necessary, but corresponds to the deﬁnition of the adjoint
operator given in the section  operator).
The following example shows that an isometric operator acting in a complex
Hilbert space is in general not unitary. Let φ1, φ2, . . . be a complete orthonormal
system of an inﬁnite-dimensional separable  Hilbert space H. For every vector
ψ ∈H, ψ = ∞
i=1 αiφi, ∞
i=1 |αi|2<∞, deﬁne Jψ = ∞
i=1 αiφ2i; J is isometric
since ∥Jψ∥2 = ∞
i=1 |αi|2 = ∥ψ∥2, but J is not unitary since RJ ̸= H. In particu-
lar, the Hilbert space H is isomorphic to the subspace (closed submanifold) spanned
by φ2, φ4, . . .. An important example of a unitary operator is the Fourier transform
in the Hilbert space L2(R, dx) of the square-integrable functions on R. For func-
tions φ ∈L2(R, dx) that are also integrable (i.e., for φ ∈L2(R, dx) ∩L1(R, dx)),
one can deﬁne the Fourier transform ˜φ of φ by ˜φ(k) =
