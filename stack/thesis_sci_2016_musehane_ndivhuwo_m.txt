Direct Numerical Simulation of Bubble-Bubble and Droplet-Droplet
Interaction Using a Surface Thin Film Model
by Ndivhuwo M. Musehane
This dissertation deals with the simulation of dispersed multiphase ﬂow. The particle-
particle and particle-ﬂuid interactions in this class of ﬂows play an important role on the
hydrodynamics and ﬂuid transport phenomena that govern the overall ﬂow behaviour.
Accurate computational modelling of the particle-particle and particle-ﬂuid interactions
is thus required to correctly model the ﬂow. The aim of this study is to use a Direct
Numerical Simulation approach based on a smoothed Volume Of Fluid method to model
particle-particle interactions in a dispersed multiphase ﬂow at a fundamental level, and
employing a surface thin ﬁlm model, to drastically reduce the computational eﬀort re-
quired. A multiscale modelling approach is followed with the smoothed Volume Of Fluid
simulation on the particle scale and the surface thin ﬁlm model simulation on the thin-
ﬁlm scale. The resulting governing equations are the Navier-Stokes equations for an
incompressible viscous multiphase Newtonian ﬂuid undergoing laminar and isothermal
three-dimensional ﬂow, the interface advection equation and the reduced order surface
thin ﬁlm equation. The model equations are discretized using the Finite Volume Method
and implemented into the open source software OpenFOAM R⃝. The numerical solution
is obtained by solving the resulting non-linear system of equations implicitly on a struc-
tured computational grid on parallel processors using a pressure correction algorithm to
converge the pressure at each time step. The study is restricted to gas-liquid systems
where particles could either be bubbles or droplets; rigid particles are not considered.
The model is tested against experimental results from binary collision of hydrocarbon
droplets. Good qualitative numerical results are obtained at a practical computational
cost.

Introduction
This dissertation deals with the simulation of dispersed multiphase ﬂow. Multiphase
ﬂows consist of multiple materials either with diﬀerent phases (gas and/or liquid and/or
solid) or with diﬀerent material properties (ﬂuid and ﬂuid). Dispersed multiphase ﬂow is
a class of ﬂow in which discrete particles are suspended within a continuous phase. For
our purposes particles can either be droplets suspended in a gaseous or liquid continuous
phase or gas bubbles suspended in a liquid phase. Solid particles are not considered in
this dissertation.
The particle-particle and particle-ﬂuid interactions in this class of ﬂows play an impor-
tant role in the hydrodynamics and ﬂuid transport phenomena that govern the overall
ﬂow behaviour. Accurate computational modelling of the particle-particle and particle-
ﬂuid interactions is thus required to correctly model the ﬂow. In this dissertation we
attempt to address some of the shortcomings of existing modelling techniques.
Dispersed multiphase ﬂows are found in processes in the chemical, petrochemical, aero-
space and manufacturing industries, and in nature. The discussion that follows gives
various application areas where particle-particle interactions are important.
1.1
Applications
In chemical, petrochemical and biological processes, bubble column reactors are com-
monly used. These are multiphase reactors where a gas phase is dispersed into a liquid
phase in the form of bubbles.
They have wide applications as liquid contactors, by
dispersing the gas phase into the liquid phase for a chemical reaction to occur. For
example, in coal liquefaction – the process of changing coal into a liquid hydrocarbon

for the later production of liquid fuels – hydrogen gas is dispersed into a slurry of coal
and catalysts in a bubble column reactor.
Their wide application in industry can be attributed to their simple construction (Jakob-
sen et al., 2005) and due to this there are few degrees of freedom that can be changed to
improve their performance (Ranade, 1997). This leaves a need to understand in detail
the ﬂuid ﬂow phenomena that occur in the columns.
Two types of ﬂow regimes are commonly encountered depending on the reactor operating
conditions, namely the homogeneous regime, characterized by uniform small spherical
bubbles with no coalescence or breakup and low superﬁcial gas velocities, and the hetero-
geneous or churn turbulent regime, characterized by high superﬁcial gas velocities which
encourage coalescence and breakup, and which leads to a wide bubble size distribution
(Jakobsen et al., 2005, Krishna et al., 1999).
The bubbles in a bubble column reactor play a crucial role in providing the energy needed
for mixing through interfacial momentum transfer. The complex bubble interactions that
lead to coalescence or break-up of bubbles make it diﬃcult to simulate bubble column
reactors since the hydrodynamic behaviour is poorly understood. This has limited the
optimal scale-up and design of the reactors (Jakobsen et al., 2005). Coalescence and
break-up are responsible for the bubble size distribution which directly inﬂuences the
interfacial momentum transfer between the liquid and gas phases. This in turn greatly
aﬀects the optimal operating conditions of the reactor.
In contrast to the bubble-bubble and bubble-ﬂuid interactions in a bubble column re-
actor, droplet-ﬂuid and droplet-droplet interactions are found in atomized mixtures.
Atomization is a process whereby a liquid solution is split into tiny droplets to form
a spray (Gorokhovski and Herrmann, 2008). Atomized mixtures are found in various
processes including but not limited to spray drying, propulsion systems in the aerospace
industry, and in combustion engines.
In spray drying the liquid solution is fed into the spraying chamber and atomized into
tiny droplets which come into contact with the drying medium to form a powder. The
spray drying process occurs in four distinct stages: (1) atomization of the liquid into
the drying chamber, (2) spray contact with hot air, (3) moisture evaporation from the
droplets producing the powder, and lastly (4) separation of the powder from the air
stream (Kuriakose and Anandharamakrishnan, 2010). This process can be applied to
the production of food (e.g. powdered milk, instant coﬀee, soup) and pharmaceutical
products (Pawar et al., 2015).
Droplet-droplet interactions which result in either coalescence or rebound are common
in stage 2 of the spray drying process and inﬂuence the particle distribution in the

spray chamber, which in turn greatly aﬀects the properties of the powder produced.
Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) modelling of the droplet-droplet and droplet-ﬂuid
interactions is a powerful tool that can be used to understand this complex hydrodynamic
behaviour.
In turbojet and diesel engines the fuel is atomized and injected into the combustion
chamber. Droplet-droplet collisions determine the characteristics of the spray and inﬂu-
ence to a degree the stability of ﬂame ignition (Murrone and Villedieu, 2011).
Bubble-bubble, bubble-ﬂuid and bubble-solid interactions are found in a ﬂotation cell.
Flotation is used, for example in the treatment of waste water and in the extraction of
minerals from an ore in the mining industry.
In the minerals industry the mineral ore is ground and mixed with liquids and catalysts
in a ﬂotation cell which is similar to a bubble column reactor. Air is dispersed in the form
of bubbles at the bottom of the tank and as the bubbles rise to the top of the reactor
the mineral particles attach to the bubbles. The bubble size distribution directly aﬀects
the overall gas hold up which has major implications on the ﬂotation rate (Gorain et al.,
1995).
Multiphase microﬂuidics is becoming an increasingly popular research area that is char-
acterized by manipulating ﬂuids inside micrometer (µm) length scale channels (Zhao
and Middelberg, 2011). A microﬂuidic chip is commonly used in many applications.
It is made of a material etched with µm channels connected to an input and an out-
put. The channels can be T-junctions where the ﬂuid from the input can be separated
into droplets. Droplet interactions which result in coalescence inﬂuence the chemical
reactions and mixing.
1.2
Computational modelling of multiphase ﬂow
The industrial processes and applications highlighted above demonstrate the need to
understand and study particle-particle and particle-ﬂuid interactions. In most of these
applications the particle-ﬂuid phase ratio is high; this results in an increase in particle
collision.
Coalescence greatly aﬀects the size distribution and shapes which are im-
portant aspects that aﬀect the optimal operating conditions. This calls for accurate
modelling of the collision event with its associated coalescence and rebound.
The collision process results in either rebound or coalescence of the particles depending
on particle size, velocity, shape etc. The vastly diﬀerent outcomes and their sensitive

Chapter 1. Introduction

dependence on the aforementioned parameters make the accurate modelling of collision
very important in predicting the macroscopic properties of the ﬂow.
The collision process can be described in three stages by the ﬁlm drainage theory (Chen
et al., 1984) and is considered very complex. Consider two interacting particles; Stage 1
is when they approach each other, and as they do so a thin liquid ﬁlm of the surrounding
ﬂuid is trapped between them; Stage 2 is when this liquid ﬁlm drains out; and lastly in
Stage 3 the particles will either coalesce if the thin ﬁlm becomes unstable, leading to
rupture or bounce apart if the liquid ﬁlm does not attain this critical ﬁlm thickness.
The governing equations for the particle-particle interactions in a dispersed multiphase
ﬂuid are the Navier-Stokes equations.
The complexity in multiphase ﬂow modelling
comes from the discontinuity of ﬂuid properties across the interface.
CFD is widely used alongside experimentation as a tool to study in detail the transport
phenomena that govern multiphase ﬂow. The modelling approaches used diﬀer in their
description and treatment of the dispersed particles. The most widely employed tech-
niques are the Euler-Euler, Euler-Lagrange, front tracking and front capturing methods.
The ﬁrst two methods rely heavily on prior knowledge of the ﬂow structures in the form
of empirical correlations when modelling particle-particle interactions. Front capturing
and front tracking methods provide a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) approach
that explicitly tracks the motion of the interface between phases. This makes it easier to
model particle-particle interactions from ﬁrst principles, but at far greater computational
cost. DNS provides a fundamental level modelling approach to study the hydrodynamic
behaviour.

media. An Eulerian description of ﬂuid properties is used for both phases. The diﬀerent
phases are deﬁned by a phase fraction ﬁeld and the volume averaged mass conservation
equations are assembled and solved for each individual phase. It describes the motion
of the two phases in a macroscopic sense (Chen et al., 2004) in which a continuous ﬁeld
is used to represent the concentration of dispersed particles, and is typically used for
large scale ﬂow structures.
Closure relations are required to close the system of governing equations in the Euler-
Euler formulation (Jakobsen, 2014). The coupling between the phases is achieved by
introducing empirical or simpliﬁed theoretical models for the drag and lift forces on the
dispersed particles (Jakobsen, 2014).

In contrast to the Euler-Euler formulation, the Euler-Lagrange formulation uses an
Eulerian description for the continuous phase only and a Lagrangian description is used
for the dispersed phase. An equation of motion is solved to track the motion of each
individual particle, with the particles often assumed to be hard spheres.
Similar to
the Euler-Euler formulation, empirical correlations are required for the Euler-Lagrange
formulation in order to represent the coupling between the continuous and dispersed
phases.
Studies with the Euler-Euler formulation include the study of Sokolichin and Eigenberger
(1994) who solved numerically for the gas-liquid bubble ﬂow in a loop reactor or bubble
column reactor using a laminar two-dimensional dynamic model. Their model assumed
a single bubble class and ignored bubble coalescence and re-dispersion. Coupling of the
two phases was achieved by using an interaction force term which they noted could not be
considered in detail in the Euler-Euler formulation but would need to be approximated
with an empirical correlation.
The study of Grevskott et al. (1996) on bubble column reactors included a sub-model
for bubble size into the Euler-Euler model. Although the bubble size distribution in
the heterogeneous regime qualitatively agreed with experiments, the radial size proﬁles
did not and they suggested the use of a bubble size distribution model based on the
population balance equation. The population balance equation is an equation that solves
for the number density of particles. It requires numerical values of collision frequency
which is determined by empirical models.
Fleischer et al. (1996) used a one-dimensional dynamic two-phase model to study the
transient behaviour of a bubble column reactor and calculated the bubble size distri-
bution using a population balance equation that included terms for growth, breakup
and coalescence of the bubbles. The results obtained were able to predict qualitatively
the transient behaviour. Colella et al. (1999) used a bubble-bubble interaction model
to obtain correct breakage and coalescence rates to include into the population balance
equation for accurate prediction of bubble size distribution in a bubble column reactor.
Chen et al. (2005) compared diﬀerent coalescence and breakup closures for the popula-
tion balance equation in the heterogeneous regime; the results showed that the diﬀerent
closures did not produce signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results.
Although the population balance equation coupled to the Euler-Euler model has helped
researchers obtain good agreement with experimental results, most of the closures that
are needed for the equations are not fundamental but empirical correlations that have
been derived from phenomenological models. This leaves some of the models only valid
for a speciﬁc ﬂow regime (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and speciﬁc experimental
conditions.

In the Euler-Lagrange model the particle-particle interactions are directly modelled.
Delnoij et al. (1997b) coupled to the Euler-Lagrange model a hard nondeformable sphere
collision model from gas-ﬂuidized beds with the aim of modelling the direct bubble-
bubble interactions. The assumption of nondeformable bubbles was not valid for the
heterogeneous regime and most studies including those by Delnoij et al. (1999) and
Darmana et al. (2005) have been limited to the homogeneous regime. Larger bubbles
may have complex shapes and may be poorly represented.
An advantage of the Euler-Euler formulation is the computational eﬃciency it provides
for practical applications, but at the cost of accuracy (Jakobsen et al., 1997). The Euler-
Lagrange model is computationally intensive, but tracking particle clusters instead of
individual particles can reduce computational cost (O’Rourke et al., 2009). The main
advantage of the Euler-Lagrange method is that particle-particle and particle-liquid
interactions can be individually modelled (Sokolichin and Eigenberger, 1994) while still
assuming a particle shape (e.g. hard sphere) and empirical drag correlations.
According to a comparison between the two formulations, Lapin and L¨ubbert (1994)
found that the results of the Euler-Euler model were corrupted with numerical diﬀusion
when applied to a bubble column reactor and suggested that the tracking of individual
bubbles or bubble clusters as done in the Euler-Lagrange model could be a solution
to this problem. However, a comparison of the two models again by Sokolichin et al.
(1997) showed that the use of second-order discretization based on the total variation
diminishing method instead of ﬁrst-order upwind in the solution of the gas hold-up
equation considerably reduced the numerical diﬀusion.
Both the Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange formulations have their weaknesses and their
strong points. They both are deﬁcient however in that they use empirical closure mod-
els whenever coalescence of particles is included in a model, and are thus not viable
candidates in studying particle-particle interactions on a fundamental level.
When modelling a bubble column reactor, Lubbert et al. (1996) suggested using three
diﬀerent length scales; the bubble, the bubble swarm and the reactor scale with the
mechanisms in each scale independent of each other, which allows for a separation of the
transport properties according to length scale. Delnoij et al. (1997a) noted that using
a generalized CFD model is not eﬃcient in modelling the bubble column reactor and
suggested using a “hierarchy of models”. This hierarchy would include a tracking method
to be used to give detailed data on particle-particle and particle-ﬂuid interactions which
can be used to validate the closure models used in Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange type
simulations. This multi-scale modelling technique is the approach of the present study.

Chapter 1. Introduction

We turn our attention to DNS type approaches because it is diﬃcult to do suﬃciently
well controlled experiments and/or to extract detailed enough data to set all the empiri-
cal parameters in the Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange methods correctly. A formulation
similar to the Euler-Euler can be identiﬁed that describes the ﬂow in an Eulerian frame-
work, but which uses a tracking technique to describe the particle-ﬂuid interface.
Each particle is simulated by tracking its interface instead of using an average par-
ticle distribution. The small resolution of the ﬂuid velocity is obtained and particle
coalescence, break-up, merging and topology changes that are of importance in particle-
particle modelling can be accurately captured (Delnoij et al., 1997b).
The tracking
methods discussed here fall under two categories: the interface tracking methods, and
interface capturing methods.
1.2.2
Interface tracking methods
Interface tracking and Lagrangian type methods involve computational elements moving
through a stationary Eulerian grid (de Sousa et al., 2004), where the computational
mesh is moved with the interface.
Examples include the Marker-and-Cell technique
of Harlow and Welch (1965) where marker particles are used to track the interface,
and the front-tracking method developed by Unverdi and Tryggvason (1992) which also
explicitly tracked the interface using computational elements. Unverdi and Tryggvason
(1992) used two grids; a three-dimensional Cartesian and stationary grid deﬁned the
computational domain while a two-dimensional triangular moving grid over-set on the
three-dimensional grid was used to describe the interface.
Unverdi and Tryggvason (1992) studied the rise of a steady-state gas bubble and the
collision of two equal sized bubbles and noted that the front tracking method has a
limitation when two interfaces interact. The bubbles remained separate domains and
could not merge together unless the interface between them was explicitly removed.
Nobari et al. (1996) studied a binary head-on collision of equal sized droplets using
a front tracking method with ﬂuids that have low density and viscosity ratios. The
coalescence was performed artiﬁcially by removing the interfaces at a prescribed time.
Unverdi and Tryggvason (1992) and Nobari et al. (1996) suggested that a sub-grid
model that calculated the pressure and the velocities in the thin ﬁlm region to predict
the coalescence time would provide a model with good predictive capabilities.
The greatest advantage of the front-tracking technique is that the surface tension can
be incorporated into the method in a natural way. However, modelling the coalescence
of particles is complex. The front-tracking method is computationally expensive and
exhibits mesh entanglement whenever there are large topology changes.

Chapter 1. Introduction

1.2.3
Interface capturing methods
In contrast to the front-tracking technique, interface capturing methods can be described
as methods where the interface is reconstructed from ﬁeld variables. Examples include
the Level Set (LS) method (Sethian and Smereka, 2003), the Volume of Fluid (VOF)
method (Hirt and Nichols, 1981) and other variations and the Composite Level Set and
Volume of Fluid (CLSVOF) method (Sussman and Puckett, 2000).
In the LS method the interface is deﬁned as the zero level-set of a characteristic function
φ with the initial function chosen as the signed distance function to the interface (Sethian
and Smereka, 2003). In general the LS method can be described as the advection of a
smooth function by the velocity ﬁeld. The advantage of the LS method is its accuracy in
the computation of the surface normal and curvature because it uses a smooth function φ
in the calculation of gradients (Sussman and Puckett, 2000). The main disadvantage of
the LS method is that it does not conserve mass in cases of high interface deformations
(Denner et al., 2014).
The collision between particles can result in very high shape
deformations and so the LS method has not been considered in this work.
The VOF method can be generalized as the advection of a discontinuous ﬁeld (Denner
et al., 2014). The discontinuous ﬁeld is the volume fraction ﬁeld α, described as the ratio
of the volume of the ﬁrst ﬂuid to the total ﬂuid volume in a cell. The value of α is 1 in
the ﬁrst ﬂuid and 0 in the second with the interface denoted by cells with values between
0 and 1 (Hirt and Nichols, 1981). An interface advection equation uses the velocity to
propagate the interface. The advantage of the VOF method is that it conserves mass.
The main disadvantage of the VOF method is that the computation of the normal and
curvature are inaccurate since α is a discontinuous function. This can result in parasitic
currents (Lafaurie et al., 1994), which will be referred to as nonphysical velocities in this
dissertation.
To maintain a sharp interface of the volume fraction ﬁeld, various techniques have been
developed to reconstruct the interface such as the simple line interface calculation (SLIC)
(Noh and Woodward, 1976), Young’s VOF (Youngs, 1982), compressive interface cap-
turing for arbitrary meshes (CICSAM) (Ubbink and Issa, 1999) and piecewise linear
interface calculation (PLIC) (Renardy and Renardy, 2002).
The aim of the CLSVOF method is to combine the strengths of both the LS and VOF
method. It deﬁnes the interface as the zero level set of φ. A translation is done through
the Heaviside function to represent α in terms of φ. The new method combines both the
ability of the LS method to correctly compute curvature from a smooth function and
the VOF mass conservation property. The CLSVOF can be computationally expensive
with the need to re-initialize the distance function and various studies have been done

Chapter 1. Introduction
9
on ways to re-initialize φ to keep it smooth (Cho et al., 2011, Sussman and Fatemi, 1999,
Sussman et al., 1998).
The VOF method is used in this study because it solves for the simulated motion of the
particle-ﬂuid interface from a fundamental level at a reasonable computational cost and
the LS method on its own does not conserve mass. In the section to follow, the VOF
method will be discussed in detail.
1.2.4
Volume-Of-Fluid method
In the VOF method an Eulerian description is used for both phases and the solution
process performed on an Eulerian or arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian grid. A volume av-
eraged indicator function α(x, t) is assigned for each computational cell and advected
through space by the velocity obtained from solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The
two main numerical challenges with the VOF method are computing correctly the cur-
vature, and nonphysical coalescence that occurs when interfaces are within a mesh cell
spacing.
The curvature computation is a result of the surface tension model used. In this study
this model is the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) formulation of Brackbill et al. (1992).
The surface tension force which would otherwise be obtained from jump conditions across
the interface is reformulated as a volume force and introduced into the momentum
equation as a body force. Problems arise in the computation of the curvature. Due
to the calculation of second-order spatial derivatives of the step function, the VOF
method poorly estimates the curvature (Cummins et al., 2005). The applicability of the
CSF method to surface tension-dominated ﬂows is limited because of the generation of
nonphysical velocities (Denner et al., 2014, Harvie et al., 2006, Lafaurie et al., 1994)
that do not decrease with an increase in the mesh reﬁnement (Harvie et al., 2006).
The static sphere in a two-dimensional square with negligible gravity is a common test
used to verify that the surface tension force has been correctly calculated. In the ideal
situation all the terms of the Navier-Stokes equation involving velocity and gravity would
be zero, leaving the pressure gradient to balance the surface tension forces. But in the
case of the CSF method the curvature is incorrectly calculated, leaving the pressure
gradient unable to balance the surface tension force. Some of the velocity terms are
required to restore the balance but at the cost of introducing nonphysical velocities
whose magnitude can introduce oscillations to the solution.
Of the diﬀerent techniques that have been used in the literature to reduce the magnitude
of the nonphysical velocities, smoothing techniques are the most popular and they diﬀer

Chapter 1. Introduction
10
in the smoothing kernels used. An example is the work of Cummins et al. (2005). In
this study a diﬀusive type smoother as implemented by Heyns et al. (2011) is used with
a variable user deﬁned coeﬃcient to specify the number of cells to smear the interface
over.
Studies of particle interactions using the VOF method include those by Tomiyama et al.
(1993) who used the VOF method to study the rising of a single bubble in a stationary
ﬂuid with the aim of analysing the feasibility of using DNS. They noted that in the
case of skirted and spherical cap bubbles, the bubble interface was broken because the
lower and upper droplet interfaces were within a single cell. Their conclusion was that a
ﬁner computational mesh was needed to simulate skirted and spherical cap bubbles. Lin
et al. (1996) were among the ﬁrst authors to study the ﬂow in a bubble column reactor
using a two-dimensional model based on the VOF method. They noted that this method
provides a simple and economical way to study individual bubbles. Their model however
did not account for bubble collision. Delnoij et al. (1997b) used the VOF method to
study the dynamics of multiple deformable gas bubbles.
In their subsequent study,
Delnoij et al. (1998) studied the rise, formation and coalescence of skirted spherical cap
bubbles in liquids and included a CSF model for the surface tension force.
Nikolopoulos et al. (2009b) studied a non-central binary collision between equal sized
droplets using a VOF method with adaptive mesh reﬁnement to correctly model the
gas-liquid interface region. Nikolopoulos et al. (2012) again used the VOF methodology
to study the impact that the Weber number has on the outcome of a binary collision
between unequal sized droplets. Adaptive mesh reﬁnement was used to resolve the thin
ﬁlm. Liu et al. (2013) used an axi-symmetric grid to simulate numerically the head-
on collision of binary gel propellant droplets using the VOF method, and investigated
the coalescence of the droplets. Albadawi et al. (2014) studied the free rise, collision
and rebound of an isolated bubble on a wall using axi-symmetric and three-dimensional
simulations. Their ﬁnding was that a reﬁned mesh close to the solid surface provided
accurate quantitative results.
When two particles collide the surrounding ﬂuid is trapped in a thin ﬁlm between them.
This thin ﬁlm is at a smaller length scale compared to that of the particles. In the study
of Tomiyama et al. (1993) the skirted and spherical cap bubble interfaces were broken
because the interfaces were too close to each other. There was not enough resolution
provided for the VOF method to capture the small ﬂuid velocities in order to accurately
capture the interface. To resolve the existence of this thin ﬁlm later studies opted to use
very ﬁne computational grids in order to resolve the small scale ﬂuid velocities (Albadawi
et al., 2014, Nikolopoulos et al., 2009b, 2012).

Chapter 1. Introduction
11
Researchers that have reported this inability of the VOF method to accurately capture
interfaces that are within a single mesh cell spacing without artiﬁcially merging them
include Coyajee and Boersma (2009), Gauer et al. (2009), van Sint Annaland et al.
(2005).
Adaptive mesh reﬁnement at the particle-ﬂuid interface has been the solution of choice
with the increase in computational power when simulating particle-particle interactions
with the VOF method. Even with a single particle the mesh resolution required is very
high due to the thickness of the thin ﬁlm that must be resolved.
A ﬁner computa-
tional grid would provide more cells between interfaces such that the interfaces will not
be within a mesh cell spacing for the artiﬁcial merging to take place. This is not the
approach of the present study, as adaptive mesh reﬁnement can become computation-
ally expensive when the particle numbers increase and storage requirements become a
problem.
Coyajee and Boersma (2009) proposed a multiple marker method in the framework of the
CLSVOF method to simulate droplet impact without artiﬁcial coalescence. The method
used multiple LS functions corresponding to multiple volume fraction ﬁelds to represent
individual droplets.
Validation was done using a droplet falling under the inﬂuence
of gravity and impacting an interface. The method managed to successfully prevent
the droplet from automatically coalescing into the liquid layer. Kwakkel et al. (2012)
improved this method to accommodate the simulation of a large number O(102 −103)
of droplets dispersed in a turbulent ﬂuid.
Nikolopoulos et al. (2009a) studied a central binary collision of equal droplets on an
axi-symmetric grid using a two indicator VOF method with the aim of preserving the
identity of each droplet up to the point of coalescence. Adaptive mesh reﬁnement was
used as well to accurately capture the region around the interface. Focke et al. (2013)
used a DNS formulation based on a VOF method together with experiments to study the
binary collision of unequal sized droplets – a small droplet with high viscosity and a large
droplet with low viscosity. Their experimental results showed a delay in the coalescence
of the two droplets. They extended their VOF method to include the multiple marker
VOF technique of Coyajee and Boersma (2009) to temporarily delay the coalescence in
the simulation. This method was also introduced in the framework of the LS method
by Balc´azar et al. (2015), with the aim of preventing nonphysical coalescence.
The multiple marker method is simple and straightforward to implement computation-
ally, and simulates non-coalescing collisions without the need for excessively reﬁned
grids. Its main disadvantage is that it inhibits coalescence even when this should result
from the underlying physics (Coyajee and Boersma, 2009). Thus, to correctly model
both coalescence and rebound with this method, a surface thin ﬁlm model as suggested

Chapter 1. Introduction
12
by Unverdi and Tryggvason (1992) and Nobari et al. (1996) that determines the outcome
of the collision is required.
Introducing this surface thin model would result in a less computationally intensive DNS
method since the thin ﬁlm model would be used to resolve the ﬂow between the particles
instead of resolving the thin ﬁlm explicitly.
1.2.5
Surface thin ﬁlm model
The surface thin ﬁlm model suggested here is based on the Reynolds equation from
lubrication theory. Lin and Slattery (1982) and Chen et al. (1984) were among the ﬁrst
to develop a hydrodynamic theory of a thinning ﬁlm between a small bubble approaching
a liquid-liquid interface based on the Reynolds equation from lubrication theory.
Yeo et al. (2003) demonstrated the feasibility of applying lubrication theory to study ﬁlm
drainage by adopting a simpliﬁed lubrication theory approach to model the ﬁlm drainage
between surfactant coated colliding droplets approaching at a constant velocity. Zhang
and Law (2011) also noted that lubrication theory for continuum ﬂow is applicable
in solving the gas ﬂow in the thin ﬁlm region during early stages of coalescence by
theoretically analysing the binary head on collision of droplets in a gaseous environment.
Chen et al. (1984) extended the theory developed by Lin and Slattery (1982) by includ-
ing London-van der Waals forces to determine the rate of thinning and calculated the
ﬁlm drainage time. In their derivation the interfaces were assumed to be tangentially
immobile with a planar interface shape. Tsekov and Ruckenstein (1994) noted that this
assumption of plane parallel interfaces in the Reynolds equation assumption gives it the
disadvantage of not being capable of modelling interfaces that form a dimple.
In their development of a hydrodynamic model based on lubrication theory to study
deformable interfaces at nanometre separation distances, Manica et al. (2008) ignored the
dis-joining pressure due to van der Waals forces. Malav´e et al. (2009) ignored London-
van der Waals forces and concluded that inclusion of the forces in the model does not
assist in dimple formation. London-van Der Waals forces are ignored in the present study
and the assumption of locally plane parallel interfaces is adopted. Although the van der
Waals forces play an important role on thin ﬁlm thinning, they are only applicable when
the thin ﬁlm is in the nanometre scale range (Pan et al., 2008).
Studies that have demonstrated approaches of solving the Reynolds equation include
Benjamin Steinhaus and Shen (2006) who took into account both dimpling and van der
Waals forces to calculate the rate of ﬁlm thinning with the corresponding ﬁlm drainage
time of a droplet approaching a solid surface. The numerical solution was obtained by

Chapter 1. Introduction
13
solving for the thin ﬁlm thickness by providing an initial thin ﬁlm estimate and ﬁnal ﬁlm
thickness. They noted that the ﬁlm thickness had an exponential decay and coalescence
was independent of their initial estimate.
Other studies include Jiang and James (2006) who used an axisymmetric VOF method
to study the eﬀect of the van der Waals force on the head-on collision of equal sized
droplets. A modiﬁed Navier-Stokes equation that incorporated the van der Waals forces
was solved with a symmetry boundary condition imposed on the volume fraction ﬁeld to
manipulate the instant of coalescence. Kwakkel et al. (2013) who applied the method of
Zhang and Law (2011) coupled to a CLSVOF method to study the collision in droplet
laden ﬂow. Quan (2012) used a DNS approach based on the front tracking method to
study a deformable droplet falling through a ﬂuid to approach a planar solid wall, their
results of the thinning of the thin ﬁlm agreed well with results from lubrication theory.
Mason et al. (2014) studied the interaction between a droplet and an interface driven
by buoyancy. Their model coupled the CSF method in the framework of a LS method
to a lower dimensional thin ﬁlm equation based on lubrication theory with assumed
negligible electrostatic forces. A solution was obtained by solving for the pressure in the
thin ﬁlm region given the time variation in velocities obtained from the ﬂow simulation,
and coupling this back to the ﬂow solution (Mason et al., 2012). The numerical results
were compared to the experiment of Pan et al. (2008) but the obtained critical ﬁlm
thickness was a considerable underestimate of the actual experimental estimate.
A comprehensive numerical method based on solving the Reynolds equation indepen-
dently for the ﬁlm thickness given the pressure obtained from the Navier-Stokes equa-
tions and an initial thin ﬁlm thickness estimate is used in this study. This enables the
numerical model to provide an estimate of the drainage time. It is the view of the present
study that solving for the ﬁlm thickness evolution given the pressure is more advisable
as the interface-thickness boundary velocity is very small compared with the velocities
present in the ﬂuid.
1.3
Motivation
The importance of particle-particle interactions (which result in coalescence or rebound)
in industrial applications has been highlighted. Coalescence greatly aﬀects the particle
size distribution in reactors, thereby aﬀecting the overall operating conditions. But it
has shortcomings in relation to computationally modelling coalescence.

Chapter 1. Introduction
14
1.3.1
Limitations of current models
Of the various multiphase ﬂow modelling techniques that were considered, Euler-Euler
and Euler-Lagrange models were found lacking in that they require empirical correla-
tions when studying coalescence. Using these models does not provide any fundamental
insights into the coalescence process since the correlations are determined from experi-
ments and phenomenological models. These methods do not oﬀer a generalized way to
model coalescence.
Interface tracking methods and interface capturing methods have been reviewed. In in-
terface tracking, the description of the interface is done by computational elements and
the need for mesh movements and information storage on each computational element
can be computationally expensive. During particle-particle interaction large deforma-
tions and topology changes occur and mesh entanglement make it diﬃcult to capture
large topology changes. The method requires explicit interface merging descriptors when
modelling coalescence. Thus for these reasons interface tracking has been ruled out for
use in this study.
The interface capturing VOF method provides a DNS approach to modelling particle-
particle interactions. Although it is straightforward to implement computationally it
has two major drawbacks: ﬁrstly the inability to correctly model the surface tension
force, and secondly the inherent nonphysical coalescence that results when two particles
are very close to each other.
To resolve the interface correctly, most studies of particle-particle interaction using the
VOF method have resorted to using adaptive mesh reﬁnement to provide enough resolu-
tion to capture the dynamics of the thin liquid ﬁlm that forms. This is computationally
expensive as re-meshing and mesh updates are required between successive time steps.
Due to this inability to resolve small scale ﬂow variables, inherent to the VOF method is
nonphysical coalescence. There is a need to prevent the nonphysical merging of interfaces
so that particle rebound can be modelled correctly.
The multiple marker VOF method presents a solution that prevents the artiﬁcial merging
of interfaces; however, its major disadvantage is that it inhibits coalescence even when
the particles should physically coalesce.
Existing coalescence models which use ﬁlm
drainage models are based on experimental observations of coalescence frequencies to
give an estimate of drainage time. Previous computational studies that have accounted
for coalescence have been limited to using the experimentally determined drainage time
in their simulations to obtain the correct physical behaviour.

Chapter 1. Introduction
15
Solving the Reynolds equation by prescribing velocity boundary conditions as in the
approach of Mason et al. (2012) is fraught with diﬃculty given the diﬀerence in scale
between the particles and the ﬁlm. The numerical results only demonstrated one test
case out of the four sets of experiments, leaving in doubt the predictive power of their
model for a wide variety of collision outcomes. A model that can be proved to work for
all of the data available is required.
1.3.2
Need for additional research
The surface tension force plays an important role in the modelling of particle-particle
interactions.
Although the existence of nonphysical velocities which arise during its
calculation has been well documented, very complex methods have been developed to
reduce their magnitudes. Thus, given the VOF method’s inability to accurately model
the curvature due to the volume fraction ﬁeld discontinuity, there is a need to implement
a solution that will improve the curvature computation.
This should reduce the inﬂuence of nonphysical velocities in limiting interface oscillations
so that they do not aﬀect the modelling of the collision event. Such solutions should
not increase the complexity of the model and should be relatively straightforward to
implement.
The ﬁlm drainage theory of coalescence is used to describe the collision event between
particles in this study. Most previous studies of particle coalescence have focused on
either resolving the three-dimensional ﬂow in the thin ﬁlm region using extremely high
mesh densities, or on artiﬁcially merging the particles at a pre-speciﬁed time. Limited
and inconclusive attempts have so far been made to predict the ﬁlm drainage process
by modelling the thin ﬁlm as a separate entity. The thin liquid ﬁlm that forms during
the ﬁlm drainage stage introduces complexity since the resolution at very small scales
of the ﬂow velocity and pressure are required to study the dynamics of the ﬁlm which
determines the outcome of the collision. The premise of this dissertation is that thin ﬁlm
equations, similar to those employed in lubrication theory, could be derived to model
the ﬁlm drainage process explicitly but without the need for excessive mesh resolution.
With this approach, the numerical multiphase ﬂow techniques used to study particle-
particle interaction would be able to correctly resolve the particle-ﬂuid interface from
the moment of impact up to the moment of either coalescence or rebound.

Dissertation outline
The remainder of the dissertation is structured as follows. Chapter 2 introduces in detail
the VOF method in the context of the Finite Volume Method (FVM) of discretization.

Chapter 1. Introduction
17
The Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous multiphase Newtonian ﬂuid
undergoing laminar and isothermal three-dimensional ﬂow are summarized. In Chap-
ter 3 the SMMVOF method is introduced as a means for preventing the nonphysical
coalescence inherent in the VOF method. The derivation of a surface thin ﬁlm model
that calculates the thickness of the thin ﬁlm between two particles is also presented. The
next chapter, Chapter 4 presents the numerical results. The diﬀusive type smoother in-
troduced in Chapter 2 is tested using a static sphere test case in a two-dimensional box
with negligible gravity. The SMMVOF method presented in Chapter 3 is also tested
by simulating a droplet falling under the inﬂuence of gravity onto a liquid-liquid inter-

Chapter 2
Multiphase ﬂow modelling
Diﬀerent numerical modelling techniques as discussed in Chapter 1 are used to model
multiphase ﬂow.
A continuum approach with volume averaging (Whitaker, 1973) is
used in this study. The procedure of W¨orner (2003) is used to derive the model equa-
tions which are the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous multiphase
Newtonian ﬂuid undergoing laminar and isothermal three-dimensional ﬂow.
The outline of this chapter is as follows: In Section 2.1 the principles of volume averaging
are outlined. The conservation equations1 are stated for individual phases separated by
an interface in Section 2.2. It is shown in Section 2.3 that summation of the governing
equations in each phase gives the equations that govern a two-phase mixture. The VOF
method is introduced to provide closure for the governing equations in Section 2.4 and
the transport equation for the volume fraction is deduced. Section 2.5 introduces the
CSF method of Brackbill et al. (1992) to compute the surface tension force.
Sections 2.6 and 2.7 focus on the discretization and the numerical solution procedure of
the governing equations. Section 2.6 discusses the discretization of the solution domain.
In Section 2.7 the governing equations are discretized using Gauss’ divergence theorem.
The individual terms of the governing equations are grouped into convective, diﬀusive
and source terms. An Euler time integration is used with diﬀerent diﬀerencing schemes
chosen to ensure boundedness and stability of the solution.
Section 2.8 derives the
pressure equation from the semi-discretized equations and the solution algorithm is
outlined. Implementation in the open source software OpenFOAM R⃝is discussed in
Section 2.9.
1It is assumed that the reader is familiar with conservation of mass and momentum equations and a
derivation is not given.

2.1
Volume averaging
Let us consider two immiscible ﬂuids in a domain Ω⊂R3 decomposed into two time
dependent (Ω= Ω1(t)∪Ω2(t)), and non-overlapping (Ω1∩Ω2 = ∅) sub-domains. Let ∂Ω
denote the rigid boundary of Ωand Γ = Γ(x, t) the interface separating the two ﬂuids
which is assumed to be thin and massless. Deﬁne an indicator function Xk = Xk(x, t)
(where k ∈{1, 2}) at a position in Ωby
Xk(x, t) =



1
x ∈Ωk(t),
0
otherwise.
(2.1)
The indicator functions are related through the condition
X1 + X2 = 1.
(2.2)
Let V denote the volume of Ω, which is constant over time, and Vk the volume of ﬂuid
in Ωk. The volume average of the indicator function gives the volume fraction αk(x, t)
of phase k; that is,
αk = 1
V

(2.4)
The compatibility of αk follows from (2.2):
α1 + α2 = 1.
(2.5)
Let Ψk denote a general scalar or vector quantity. The volume averaged values over Ω
and Ωk , ⟨Ψk⟩and ⟨Ψk⟩k are deﬁned by
⟨Ψk⟩= 1

It follows that (2.6) and (2.7) are linearly related through (2.4):
⟨Ψk⟩= αk⟨Ψk⟩k.

Single-phase volume averaged equations
The equations of conservation of mass and momentum that govern the ﬂow in Ωk are
given by
∂ρk
∂t + ∇· (ρkuk) = 0
(2.9)
and
∂(ρkuk)
∂t
+ ∇· (ρkukuk) = ∇· τ k + fk.
(2.10)
Here ρk = ρk(x, t) is the density, uk = uk(x, t) is the velocity, fk represents body forces
acting on the ﬂuid and assumed to be gravity, so that
fk = ρkg.
(2.11)
Here g is the gravitational acceleration. τ k is the stress tensor; assuming that the ﬂuids
are Newtonian, the stress is a linear function of the rate of deformation and can be
decomposed into pressure and viscous terms according to
τ k = −pkI + 2µkEk.
(2.12)
I is the identity tensor, pk = pk(x, t) is the pressure, µk = µk(x, t) is the dynamic
viscosity, and Ek is the rate of deformation tensor, given by
Ek = 1
2(∇uk + (∇uk)T )
(2.13)
where (·)T is the transpose operator.
Applying the theorems of averaging (A.1) and (A.3) (Whitaker, 1973) to the mass con-
servation equation (2.9), we obtain
∂αkρk
∂t

V
Z

ρk(uk −vk) · nk dA.
(2.14)
The term on the righthand side is a result of averaging and represents mass transfer
through phase change, vk is the velocity of the interface, nk is the outward unit normal
vector to the interface, and Γ ∩V is the part of the interface inside the volume V . In
the absence of phase change the term on the righthand side is zero and the conservation
of mass equation reduces to
∂αkρk

VOF method
In the previous section the governing transport equations for a viscous multiphase New-
tonian ﬂuid were given. It was noted that the equations governing the motion can be
combined to obtain equations for an eﬀective ﬂuid. The governing equations for the
VOF method are similar to those obtained above.
The system of equations derived above is underdetermined and certain relations are
needed to close the system.
Assume that the density, viscosity and surface tension
coeﬃcient are known and that the latter two are constant. Assuming a homogeneous
ﬂow model by neglecting relative motion, the ﬂuid velocity and pressure of each phase
is continuous across the interface, we have
⟨u1⟩1 = ⟨u2⟩2 = um

The averaged volume fractions of each ﬂuid can be written in terms of a single volume

can write α2 = 1 −α. The mathematical description of α, viz.

is similar to the description of the indicator function (2.1). Writing the mixture density
(2.18) and viscosity (2.23) as
ρm = αρ1 + (1 −α)ρ2
(2.28)
and
µm = αµ1 + (1 −α)µ2
(2.29)
and substituting into (2.20) with the assumption that the densities ρ1 and ρ2 are constant
(resulting in incompressible ﬂow ∇·(ρmum) = 0), we obtain the equation for the volume
fraction
∂α
∂t + um · ∇α = 0
(2.30)
which describes the evolution of the interface.
Henceforth the subscript m will be dropped. The governing Navier-Stokes equations for
an incompressible viscous multiphase Newtonian ﬂuid undergoing laminar and isother-
mal three-dimensional ﬂow in the framework of the VOF method are given by:

2.5
Surface tension modelling with CSF
In the previous sections the interface separating the two ﬂuids was considered thin and
massless, and jump conditions were used to relate properties across the interface. The
surface tension relationship was obtained by using the stress balance at the interface.
In this section the CSF method (Brackbill et al., 1992) is used to compute the surface
tension force.
In the CSF method the assumption of a thin interface is replaced by an interface with a
ﬁnite thickness where there is a continuous transition of the volume fraction ﬁeld α. The
surface tension force has a continuous three-dimensional eﬀect across the interface and
thus the interfacial jump conditions are not required. The surface force is reformulated
as a volume force (Brackbill et al., 1992) that is introduced into the momentum equation
as a body force fσ; that is,
fσ = σκnδs,
(2.36)
here δs is the surface delta function that restricts the surface tension force to the interface
region and n the outward unit normal at the interface is given by
n = ∇α
|∇α|.
(2.37)
The term nδs can be replaced by ∇α to give the surface tension force as
fσ = σκ∇α.
(2.38)
The applicability of the CSF method to surface tension dominated ﬂows is limited be-
cause of the generation of nonphysical velocities (Denner et al., 2014, Harvie et al., 2006,
Lafaurie et al., 1994). These velocities scale with surface tension and viscosity (Lafaurie
et al., 1994) and occur in the region of the interface and could be a result of either an
imbalance of the surface tension force and pressure gradient or an inaccurate curvature
calculation. The curvature calculation involves computing the ﬁrst derivatives of the
volume fraction, which is a step function.
It has been shown that the magnitude of the nonphysical velocities does not decrease
with a decrease in mesh spacing or a decrease in the time step (Harvie et al., 2006)
and for some situations the currents can dominate the solution and lead to interface
break-up.
Lafaurie et al. (1994) suggested the use of a smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld αs to reduce
the magnitude of the nonphysical velocities. A diﬀusive type smoother (Heyns et al.,
2011) is used in this study with the equation for the smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld

Chapter 2. Multiphase ﬂow modelling
25
given by
∂αs
∂t = ∇2 (ηαs)
(2.39)
where η is the smoothing coeﬃcient that determines the distance that the smoothing
is performed over. The smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld αs is always reinitialized to the
unsmoothed volume fraction ﬁeld α.
Here we extend the formulation of Heyns et al. (2011) above to be independent of
the time step size, and to smooth over a given number of mesh cells rather than a
given distance. This prevents the need to tune the smoothing parameter for each case
considered. Therefore, we replace equation (2.39) with
αs −α = ∇2(ηαs)
(2.40)
where the coeﬃcient η is given by
η = χ (Af · δ)2 ,
(2.41)
and χ (χ ≥0) is a user input that speciﬁes the number of cells over which the volume
fraction ﬁeld should be smoothed, Af gives the normalized surface area vector and δ
gives the distance between the cell centres of adjacent cells.
The smoothed volume
fraction ﬁeld is used to calculate the curvature to give a smoothed curvature κs:

Discretization follows the FVM on a collocated computational mesh with dependent
variables deﬁned at the cell centres. The discretization results in a system of algebraic
equations that are solved iteratively using an implicit scheme with a pressure correction
algorithm.
The basic idea behind the FVM method is the discretization of the integral form of
the governing equations over a Control Volume (CV) with ﬁnite size (Versteeg and
Malalasekera, 2007). This results in mass and momentum being conserved at the discrete
level (Jasak, 1996).
Since discretization is done directly on the physical domain no
transformations are required. Discretization involves both the solution domain and the
system of governing equations.
2.6
Discretization of solution domain
In the FVM method, discretization in space involves dividing it into a ﬁnite number of
non-overlapping CVs to form a grid or computational mesh. Time t is discretized by
splitting the time interval into ﬁnite time-steps ∆t and marching forward with increments
of 0 = t1 < t2 . . . < . . . < tN = T with ∆t = tn −tn−1. In general the CVs can have
any polyhedral shape and their arrangement could either be structured or unstructured.
Each CV has a central node where values of all the dependent variables are stored.
Figure 2.1 shows a CV with central node P and bounded by faces with face centre f
that are either shared between CVs or coincide with the boundary. The neighbouring
CV has centroid N and the distance between P and N is given by δ. Each face has a face
area vector Af whose magnitude is given by the area of the face and whose direction is
pointing outward normal to the face.

Discretization of governing equations
Discretization of the governing equations produces a system of algebraic equations de-
ﬁned on all points of the discretized domain. Equations (2.44)-(2.50) give the partial
diﬀerential equations that govern multiphase dispersed ﬂow. Consider again the CV in
Figure 2.1. Let VP denote its volume and ∂VP its boundary surface. FVM requires
that the equations (2.44)-(2.50) be satisﬁed over VP around the point P in integral form

the momentum equation can be written as

The values of ρf, µf, uf and (∇u)f are required to compute the mass ﬂux through the
face and for the momentum equation in a manner that conserves the mass. An upwind
diﬀerencing scheme which determines the face values according to the ﬂow direction is
used to evaluate the velocities at the face centre uf. As mentioned, linear interpolation
is used to compute the face centre values of µf, ρf and (∇u)f as in equation (2.60).
The term with the time derivative is evaluated using backward diﬀerencing with the
assumption that the density is constant with respect to time in VP . An implicit Euler

Equation (2.77) gives a system of linear equations that is solved iteratively using a
geometric-algebraic multi-grid method. The initial and boundary conditions are set-
up and the momentum equation assembled with the available ﬂuxes. The pressure is
converged at each time step using a pressure correction algorithm PISO (Issa et al.,
1986). The ﬂux is updated to ensure that it satisﬁes the continuity equation and the
updated ﬂuxes are used to solve the VOF advection equation and the smoothed VOF
equation. This is done until the ﬁnal time is reached.

Implementation into OpenFOAM R
⃝
OpenFOAM R⃝(Open Field Operation and Manipulation) is an open source C++ library
of CFD tools and solvers. It is based on the FVM of discretization and is the tool of
choice in this study because new models can be incorporated into existing solvers to
simply modify a solver or to create new solvers altogether.
Like any standard CFD software, obtaining a numerical solution can be divided into
three stages: Pre-processing, simulation and post-processing (Versteeg and Malalasek-
era, 2007). OpenFOAM R⃝has utilities to pre-process, which involves the creation of a
computational domain and setting up the initial and boundary conditions. Simple ge-
ometries are used in this study, therefore the inbuilt mesh generation utility blockMesh
is used in this study.
The simulation corresponds to obtaining a numerical solution by executing a solver. The
models derived in this study are implemented into the multiphase ﬂow solver interFoam
that solves the evolution of an interface using a standard VOF method. It comes stan-
dard with parallel processing using an MPI library. The solution domain is decomposed

Chapter 2. Multiphase ﬂow modelling
32
and the numerical solution is obtained by executing the solver over multiple parallel
processors.
Post-processing involves visualization and processing the output data from the solution.
The visualization tool used is ParaView and data manipulation is done in GNU Octave.

Closure
The governing Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous multiphase Newto-
nian ﬂuid undergoing laminar and isothermal three-dimensional ﬂow have been formu-
lated. The VOF method for modelling interfaces has been introduced with the surface
tension force formulated by the CSF method. A smoothing of the volume fraction ﬁeld
has been introduced to reduce the magnitude of nonphysical velocities that arise when
second-order gradients of the discontinuous function α are calculated in the computation
of the curvature. The governing system of equations have been discretized using a FVM
with an implicit time discretization to give rise to a system of equations that can be
solved iteratively. The solution procedure has been discussed in the framework of the
open source software OpenFOAM R⃝.

Chapter 3
Particle Interaction Modelling
The mathematical model derived in the previous chapter represents the standard VOF
method which could be described as a single marker method, where diﬀerent volumes of
the same ﬂuid are assigned the same volume fraction value. In this standard implemen-
tation, numerical merging of the interfaces occurs whenever two interfaces are within
a mesh cell spacing of each other. This is because the VOF method does not resolve
the position of the interface to a resolution less than the mesh spacing. Thus, when
two interfaces approach within the cell spacing, they are automatically merged into one.
This behaviour is unrealistic.
Consider the interaction of two particles. After they collide, a thin liquid ﬁlm of the
surrounding ﬂuid is squeezed between them. As the ﬁlm becomes thinner, viscous forces
slow down the drainage processes. Eventually, if the ﬁlm reaches a critical thickness
(typically O(100nm)), instabilities cause it to break up and the particles to merge.
However, during the time taken for the ﬁlm to drain the particles may begin to bounce
apart, resulting in no coalescence occurring. The VOF method requires extremely ﬁne
mesh resolution to model the drainage of the thin ﬁlm.
Coyajee and Boersma (2009) introduced a technique to overcome numerical coalescence
known as the multiple marker method in the framework of the CLSVOF method. It
diﬀers from the standard VOF and LS methods in that separate marker functions are
used to represent diﬀerent bodies of the same ﬂuid.
The method was successful in
preventing numerical coalescence. However, the method makes no attempt to model the
physical coalescence process, and, indeed, will never allow particles to merge. Another
drawback is the high numerical cost of the CLSVOF method.
In this chapter, two new contributions are proposed to address these shortcomings.
Firstly, the multiple marker method is applied and tested in the VOF framework in
33

Chapter 3. Coalescence Modelling
34
order to provide faster solution times, and secondly the Reynolds equation is introduced
as a surface model to model the thin ﬁlm which forms between two Smooth Multiple
Marker VOF (SMMVOF) interfaces.
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: in Section 3.1 the origin of the
numerical coalescence is discussed in detail. The next Section, Section 3.2 introduces the
SMMVOF method as a means to prevent numerical coalescence. Section 3.3 provides a
detailed derivation of the Reynolds equation to model the thin ﬁlm thickness. Section 3.4
the numerical discretization and solution procedure is provided.
The results of the
chapter are summarized in Section 3.5.
3.1
Numerical coalescence
Consider two immiscible ﬂuids in a discretized domain Ω∈R3 separated into three time
dependent sub-domains, two of which are spheres with radius R as shown in Figure
3.1.
α = 1
α = 1
R
α = 0
δh
Figure 3.1: Two immiscible spheres with radius R in a discretized domain
The mesh spacing is denoted by δh. The volume fraction ﬁeld for a sphere is equal to
one within that sphere’s radius and zero outside. The ﬂuid ﬂow equations would be
solved on the entire ﬂow domain together with the VOF advection equation at every
time step.
Consider the solution of the ﬂow equations and VOF advection equation on two diﬀerent
computational grids – a coarse and a ﬁne grid. The grid resolution is quantiﬁed by the
ratio of the droplet diameter D to the mesh spacing δh in one of the coordinate axes.
For the two grids considered here this is given by D
δh = 20 and 200.
Figures 3.2 – 3.3 show how the standard VOF method performs at reconstructing the
interface as the grid resolution is improved. The length between the interfaces in both
grids is kept constant at 0.0025D.
From Figure 3.2 the existence of the separation
distance between the interfaces is questionable. There is not enough resolution to model

its existence and consequently its dynamics. However as the mesh is excessively reﬁned
to a very small mesh spacing the separation distance is resolved as in Figure 3.3.
Therefore, as the droplets move close to each other the small distance that separates their
interfaces is not correctly resolved by the VOF indicator ﬁeld, and a liquid bridge forms
between them. The surface tension force of each droplet is directed towards the centre
of the droplet, acts to keep it spherical and determines its equilibrium shape. However,
the presence of the liquid bridge alters this. Figure B.1 is a schematic representation of
the surface tension force direction in the standard VOF implementation.
As the droplets move closer to each other, the surface tension force (shown by fσ in
Figure B.1) acts at the interfaces as shown. The neck of the liquid bridge introduces

fσ
Figure 3.4: Schematic representation of the surface tension force directions in the

a region of very high curvature and the surface tension force directed outwards acts to
reduce these regions of high curvature. As the simulation progresses the liquid bridge
stretches open to result in the merging of the volume fraction ﬁelds in what has been
observed as nonphysical coalescence. Ideally the droplets could be almost inﬁnitely close
to each other without them artiﬁcially merging because the surface tension force keeps
each sphere separate.
Excessive mesh reﬁnement is required to resolve the thin liquid ﬁlm that exists between
the droplets. This is important for modelling droplet hydrodynamics such as coales-
cence and rebound. The accuracy of simulating particle collision with the VOF method
improves with reﬁnement of the interface, but the order of reﬁnement required is imprac-
tical. As previously mentioned, the thin ﬁlm separating the particles typically persists
down to a thickness of the order of O(100nm), requiring D
δh ∼O(103 −106) for typical
particle diameters encountered. The use of adaptive mesh reﬁnement can reduce the
computational eﬀort but it can become costly whenever one considers large numbers of
particles, as is often encountered in industrial applications.
To model the close interaction of particles without nonphysical or premature coales-
cence at a reduced computational cost the Multiple Marker VOF method is adopted.
The section that follows discusses this method in the framework of the smoothed VOF
method.

Consider again the two immiscible ﬂuids in a discretized domain introduced in the
previous section. The immiscible ﬂuids (both spheres) were assigned the same volume
fraction ﬁeld value of one and the continuous phase assigned a volume fraction ﬁeld
value of zero. The domain in ﬁgure 3.1 is redeﬁned as in Figure 3.5.

Let us now consider N volumes of the immiscible ﬂuid, Ωθ(t), θ ∈{1, 2, ..., N}, dispersed
in a continuous ﬂuid. Deﬁne for each volume a volume fraction ﬁeld value α1, α2, ..., αN.
Each volume is represented mathematically by
Ωθ(t) = {x | αθ(x, t) = 1},

where αs
θ is the smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld for each individual domain Ωθ. This
method introduces N equations for the volume fraction ﬁeld compared to one advection
equation for the single marker VOF method. The volume fraction ﬁeld αN+1 for the

ﬂuid (an adjacent particle). At the interface of two interacting particles the direction
of the surface tension force is as shown in Figure 3.6. The surface tension force acts to

results with the standard VOF method.

The numerical solution is obtained by the same procedure discussed in Chapter 2. The
FVM method is used to discretize the governing equations which are solved iteratively
with the PISO algorithm. The equation for the volume fraction ﬁelds both smooth and
unsmoothed is solved one at a time for each individual phase.
In the SMMVOF method the surface tension force is calculated for each individual ﬂuid
volume. Each ﬂuid volume is always assumed to be surrounded by a diﬀerent ﬂuid and
this ensures that the ﬂuid volumes are always separate. The SMMVOF method will
always prevent the nonphysical coalescence that is inherent in the VOF method. The
method can thus simulate successfully the collision of particles that always result in
rebound, but will not model particle collision that results in coalescence. In the next
section the Reynolds equation from lubrication theory is introduced and derived as a
surface thin ﬁlm model to calculate the thickness of the thin ﬁlm between interacting
particles to provide a criterion for coalescence.
3.3
Surface thin ﬁlm model of coalescence
Modelling coalescence is an important aspect of a numerical method for dispersed multi-
phase ﬂow because it is responsible for droplet or bubble size evolution (Liao and Lucas,
2010) in various industrial applications.

Liao and Lucas (2010) and Chan et al. (2011) give a comprehensive review of coalescence
models that have been used. They summarize the models under three categories with the
most popular being the ﬁlm drainage theory. The ﬁlm drainage theory of coalescence
can be described in three stages. Stage 1 is when the particles approach each other
(Figure 3.7), and as they do so a thin liquid ﬁlm of the surrounding ﬂuid is trapped
between them; Stage 2 (Figure 3.8) is when this liquid ﬁlm drains out to a ﬁlm thickness
h over a drainage time td; and lastly in Stage 3 if the ﬁlm thickness attains the critical
thickness, the ﬁlm becomes unstable and ruptures leading to coalescence, but if the
critical ﬁlm thickness is not attained the particles will bounce apart.
Stage 2 is the most complex of the three stages. As the particles move closer together
the thin liquid ﬁlm starts to drain out.
In their review of ﬁlm drainage models for
tangentially immobile interfaces, Coons et al. (2003) explained the evolution of the
interface deformation. As the particles move closer to each other, the hydrodynamic
drag increases the normal force resulting in the interface changing its shape from convex
to concave in what is referred to in the literature as the “dimple” (Figure 3.9) (Jiang
and James, 2006, Quan, 2012) which can evolve to form a bell shape while others evolve
to a planar shape depicted in Figure 3.8.
The ﬁlm thickness h at which coalescence occurs is much smaller than the radius of
the dispersed ﬂuid particles. A surface model that accounts for the thin ﬁlm explicitly
is suggested to model the coalescence of impacting particles to be implemented in the

Problem description
Consider two mobile interfaces that are approaching each other with velocities u1 and
u2 as shown in Figure 3.10. The interfaces enclose two dispersed particles described
by the SMMVOF method. Let R denote the radius of the dispersed particle and h0
the initial separation between the interfaces. The ﬂuid bounded by each interface is
assigned a volume fraction ﬁeld value in the framework of the SMMVOF method. As

time progresses the two interfaces continue to approach each other and the pressure
inside the thin ﬁlm region forces the ﬂuid out. When the thickness between the interfaces
reaches hCrit the interfaces merge to form a single ﬂuid volume. hCrit is a user input
parameter into the model.

Model assumptions
The following assumptions are taken into consideration when deriving the hydrodynamic
Reynolds equation;
1. Since the thin ﬁlm thickness is much smaller than the radius of either particle
(h ≪R), the interfaces between each particle and the ﬁlm can be assumed to be
locally planar. Thus, the ﬁlm locally resembles a box in three dimensions or a
tube in two dimensions. In the derivation that follows, we deﬁne the x −z axis to
be co-planar with interface 1. The y axis is therefore in the direction of the ﬁlm
thickness as shown in Figure 3.10.
2. The ﬁlm thickness is thus a function of the other two coordinate directions and
time:
h = h(x, z, t).
(3.14)
3. In this tube the eﬀects of gravity and surface tension are considered negligible.
4. Across the thickness of the thin ﬁlm the pressure gradient is assumed to be con-
stant:
∂p
∂y = 0.
(3.15)
5. The continuity equation holds:
∂ρ
∂t + ∂
∂x(ρux) + ∂
∂y(ρuy) + ∂
∂z (ρuz) = 0.

where (x(t), h(t)/2, z(t)) and (x(t), −h(t)/2, z(t)) are ﬁxed points on the upper and lower

In the above the axes have been chosen to be locally aligned with the ﬁlm. Now (3.43)
is expressed in a form that is independent of the coordinate system chosen. For this

Numerical Implementation
The equation (3.44) that governs the dynamics of the thin ﬁlm has been derived in the
previous section. The model equations that govern the multiphase ﬂow of interacting
particles are the Navier-Stokes equations in the SMMVOF framework coupled with the
Reynolds equation. Following a multiscale approach, the SMMVOF method is used to
obtain the ﬂow variables while the Reynolds equation is used to solve for the thickness
of the thin ﬁlm.
The solution to equation (3.44) gives the thickness h of the thin ﬁlm between two
interfaces. Typically, the Reynolds equation (3.44) is solved for pressure given a known
time variation of the ﬁlm thickness. In this study, however, the pressure is obtained
from the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation and used together with an initial ﬁlm
thickness to obtain a new estimate of the ﬁlm thickness.
In the derivation it is assumed that h ≪R, thus the Reynolds equation (3.44) is only
valid when the ﬁlm is thin; it is not valid when particles are far apart. Thus to obtain a
solution, we need to detect when the thin ﬁlm is thin enough and initialize the equation

Chapter 3. Coalescence Modelling
48
with an initial thickness.
The solution procedure involves ﬁrstly devising a way to
measure the separation distance hEst between particles that is valid for separation of
a few mesh cells or greater. The length of this distance deﬁnes a region in space and
time that will be used to determine when and where the Reynolds equation is valid.
Secondly once the separation distance has been obtained the Reynolds equation is solved
iteratively only in the region between the interfaces. In this section these two aspects of
obtaining the numerical solution to equation (3.44) are discussed.
3.4.1
Initial separation distance
The solution domain and the governing equations for the SMMVOF method are dis-
cretized using the FVM as discussed in Chapter 2, Section 2.7.
The computational
domain is discretized to form cells with width δh which can be larger or smaller than
the thin ﬁlm thickness h.
A graphical approach based on measuring the distance from each volume fraction is used
to obtain the separation hEst between the particles. Consider two interfaces that enclose
ﬂuids described by the volume fraction ﬁelds α1 and α2 which are close to each other in
a computational domain. Consider lines which start from the interfaces pointing in the
direction of the outward unit normal to the interface ns
1 and ns
2,

∇(αs

(3.46)
Deﬁne the length from a point on the interface xi to a point x on a ray by the path
integral along the ray in the direction ns,
hEst1 =

(1 −α1)ns
1 · dl,
(3.47)
and
hEst2 =
Z x
xi
(1 −α2)ns
2 · dl.
(3.48)
Equations (3.47) and (3.48) can be expressed in diﬀerential form to aid in discretization:
∇hEst1 · ns
1 = (1 −α1)
(3.49)
and
∇hEst2 · ns
2 = (1 −α2).
(3.50)
The path integrals (3.47) and (3.48) start from the interface so a switch is used to set
the initial value at the interface to zero. The above two equations need to be replaced by

Chapter 3. Coalescence Modelling
49
hEst1 = 0 and hEst2 = 0 inside the particle, so we multiply both sides of equations (3.49)
and (3.50) by a positive boolean switch ([1 −pos(α1 −0.95)] and [1 −pos(α2 −0.95)]),
and add [pos(α1 −0.95)hEst1] and [pos(α2 −0.95)hEst2] to the respective equations so
that when α1 > 0.95 and α2 > 0.95 we end up with hEst1 = 0 and hEst2 = 0. The
function pos(s) is a positive Boolean given by
pos(s) =



1
s ≥0,
0
s < 0.
(3.51)
Equations (3.49) and (3.50) are then replaced by
[1 −pos(α1 −0.95)] (∇hEst1 · ns
1) = [1 −pos(α1 −0.95)] (1 −α1) + pos(α1 −0.95)hEst1
(3.52)
and
[1 −pos(α2 −0.95)] (∇hEst2 · ns
2) = [1 −pos(α2 −0.95)] (1 −α2) + pos(α2 −0.95)hEst2.
(3.53)
The scalar product can be expanded using a divergence identity1 to give
[1 −pos(α1 −0.95)] (∇· (hEst1ns
1) −hEst1(∇· ns
1)) =
[1 −pos(α1 −0.95)] (1 −α1) + pos(α1 −0.95)hEst1
(3.54)
and
[1 −pos(α2 −0.95)] (∇· (hEst2ns
2) −hEst2(∇· ns
2)) =
[1 −pos(α2 −0.95)] (1 −α2) + pos(α2 −0.95)hEst2,
(3.55)
which will simplify the discretization process even further. Evaluating the integral form
of the equations and applying Gauss’ divergence theorem (2.56), the discretized equa-
tions for the separation distance are

(3.57)
The discretized equations give a system of equations which are solved iteratively with
the source terms on the LHS treated implicitly.
In the region between the two interfaces, the sum of hEst1 and hEst2 gives the separation
distance between the interfaces. Thus the estimate hEst is obtained from
hEst = hEst1 + hEst2
(3.58)
since this gives the sum of the distance to interface 1 along the ray in direction ns
1 and
the distance to interface 2 along the ray in direction ns
2 from any given point. This
approach cannot however be used to obtain distances that are smaller than a mesh cell
spacing since the SMMVOF method does not provide enough resolution at that scale.
The value of hEst is used as an initial condition for the Reynolds equation.
3.4.2
Thin ﬁlm region
With the initial separation distance between the interfaces calculated, a region where
the Reynolds equation is valid is calculated. An estimate of the mesh spacing δh in the
direction normal to the thin ﬁlm,
δh =
P
f |ns∗· Af| V
|Af|
P
f |ns∗· Af|
(3.59)
is calculated for each cell. Here, V is the volume of the cell, ns∗the unit normal vector

1 + αs
2)
| ∇(−αs

(3.60)
and ns∗· Af is the projected face area in the direction normal to the interface.
A multiple of the mesh spacing estimate is used to restrict and deﬁne the mesh location
where equation (3.44) is actually calculated. This restricts the calculation of the equation
to areas that are very close to the thin ﬁlm region. The boolean switch which identiﬁes

Chapter 3. Coalescence Modelling
51
the region is deﬁned by
β = pos (ξδh −hEst) pos(αs
1 −0.001)pos(αs
2 −0.001)
(3.61)
where ξ is a parameter that determines the width of the region where the thin ﬁlm
equation is solved as a multiple of the mesh spacing.
The region β is set to one (turned on) whenever hEst < ξδh, i.e. whenever the initial
separation distance is less than the width of ξ cells. In addition, in regions where either
αs
1 or αs
2 are very close to zero, β is set to zero (turned oﬀ); this allows for the calculation
to hold even when the smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld values αs are constant and hence
ns and δh are not correctly calculated. These regions are suﬃciently far from the particle
interfaces (where αs = 0.5), that the thin ﬁlm equation is not valid in these regions and
is not solved. In order for hEst to be used as initial value of h to solve the Reynolds
equation, h is set equal to hEst outside the thin ﬁlm region, i.e. where β = 0. The thin
ﬁlm equation (3.44) now becomes

There is a numerical discontinuity between the values of h inside the thin ﬁlm region
β and those outside that have been pegged to hEst. Evaluation of the gradient of h in
the second last term of (3.62) would be incorrect for computational cells that surround
the thin ﬁlm region. To avoid the discontinuity of the gradient of h at the boundary of
the thin ﬁlm region the gradient of h is evaluated in a reduced thin ﬁlm region βreduced

The smoothing of the volume fraction ﬁelds smears the interface which means the pres-
sure gradient obtained from the Navier-Stokes equations in the interface region is a
combination of the gas and liquid pressure.
The two pressures diﬀer by the surface
tension pressure jump. In addition, pressure ﬂuctuations in the liquid are much greater
than in the gas, and smoothing was found to help counter the eﬀects of this numerical
noise.
The surface tension pressure jump is removed by removing the surface tension force from
the tangential pressure

The pressure ∇pt is smoothed using a similar procedure as in Section 2.5 to give ∇pt

is extrapolated to obtain the interface velocity vector Q throughout the thin ﬁlm region

the previous section.
A ﬂow chart of the solution procedure of the SMMVOF method coupled with the surface
thin ﬁlm method is provided in Appendix B. The procedure summarised there is as
follows;
• Set-up the initial and boundary conditions
• Calculate the available ﬂuxes and the multiple volume fraction ﬁelds
• Obtain the smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld values and calculate the smoothed
curvature
• Assemble the momentum equation
• Assemble and solve the pressure equation using a pressure correction algorithm
• Calculate hEst
• Where hEst ≤ξδh
– Solve the surface thin ﬁlm model in the region β to advance h in time
– If min(h) < hCrit
∗Merge the volume fraction ﬁelds
• Where hEst > ξδh
– set h = hEst
– Do not solve the surface ﬁlm model
• Move on to the next time step and repeat until the ﬁnal time is obtained

Closure
In this Chapter the SMMVOF has been introduced as a means to prevent nonphysical
coalescence that is inherent in the VOF method. This method is based on a smoothed
VOF method that can accurately calculate the interface curvature with minimal non-
physical velocities.
A surface thin ﬁlm model that determines coalescence has been
derived and implemented into the OpenFOAM R⃝framework. In the next chapter the
model is tested.

Chapter 4
Validation
The objective of this study is to develop and use a DNS approach based on a smoothed
VOF method to model particle-particle interactions in a dispersed multiphase ﬂow at
a fundamental level, and employing a surface thin ﬁlm model, to drastically reduce the
computational eﬀort required. Three aspects were identiﬁed that limited the numerical
modelling of particle-particle interaction using the VOF method from the moment of
impact to resulting coalescence or rebound: the nonphysical velocities that arise as a
result of inaccurate calculation of the curvature; the inherent nonphysical coalescence
that arises when interfaces enclosing separate particles are within a single mesh cell spac-
ing; and consequently the inability of the VOF method to model coalescence correctly
without using excessively reﬁned computational grids.
Each of these aspects was discussed in detail in the previous two chapters. Each aspect
forms a building block and when combined they provide a model that can be used to
study particle-particle coalescence and rebound. In this chapter the proposed model
implemented into the open source software OpenFOAM R⃝is tested.
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: In Section 4.1 the diﬀusive type
smoother coupled to the VOF method is tested by simulating a static two-dimensional
sphere with negligible gravity. The eﬀect of the smoothing parameter χ on reducing the
magnitude of the nonphysical velocities is studied to determine its optimal value. The
chosen optimal value is then used for the remainder of the tests.
In Section 4.2 the SMMVOF method is tested by simulating the gravity driven droplet
impact onto a liquid-liquid interface and the results compared to the experiment of
Mohamed-Kassim and Longmire (2003). In Section 4.3, the Reynolds equation coupled
to the previous two sub-models is validated by simulating the collision of hydrocarbon

droplets in 1 atm Nitrogen from the experiment of Pan et al. (2008). Lastly Section 4.4
summarizes the ﬁndings from the three test cases.
4.1
Test case: static sphere
In this section the implementation of the diﬀusive type smoother coupled to the VOF
method to reduce the magnitude of the nonphysical velocities for surface tension driven
ﬂows is validated using a static two-dimensional sphere. A static droplet or bubble test
case is frequently used in the literature to study the magnitude of the nonphysical ve-
locities and to validate implementations to reduce their magnitude. Ideally the pressure
gradient is balanced by the surface tension force. The pressure diﬀerence across the
droplet is given by the Young-Laplace equation
∆p = σκ,
(4.1)
where R is the radius and κ is the radius of curvature: κ = 2
R in three dimensions and
κ = 1
R in two dimensions.

in the interior of the domain with no slip conditions at the boundaries and the gravity
set to 0ms−2. The centre of the sphere is placed at the centre of the domain and the
simulation is run up a time of 0.05 seconds.
The eﬀect of the user deﬁned smoothing variable χ is studied by varying it from 0 to
4, with 0 corresponding to no smoothing or solving the standard VOF method using
the standard OpenFOAM R⃝solver interFoam, and 4 corresponding to smoothing the
volume fraction ﬁeld over 4 cells. Three diﬀerent surface tension coeﬃcients are studied:
σ = 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 kgs−2.

Chapter 4: Validation
57
The analytical result for the pressure diﬀerence across the droplet is given by the Young-
Laplace equation (4.1). A comparison of the numerical and analytic pressure is made.
The results of all the physical quantities that follow in the next section are time averaged.
4.1.2
Numerical results
The results of the pressure estimate obtained by using the diﬀerent values of χ for each
of the surface tension coeﬃcients are shown in Figures 4.1-4.3.
Figure 4.1: Pressure at diﬀerent values of χ for σ = 0.001 kgs−2
For the values of χ = 0 for the three diﬀerent test cases the pressure is underestimated
(Figures 4.1-4.3). This is as expected and the result supports the observations made
in the literature that the standard VOF method inaccurately computes the curvature
in the CSF framework. An inaccurate curvature calculation will result in an incorrect
prediction of the pressure from the Young-Laplace equation.
As the surface tension
coeﬃcient is increased the pressure estimate is still underestimated. The percentage
error in the pressure for χ = 0 for σ = 0.001 kgs−2 is 12.59%, for σ = 0.01 kgs−2 is
13.01% and for σ = 0.1 kgs−2 is 12.19%.
As χ is increased from 1 to 4 a drastic improvement is seen in the ability of the smoothed
VOF method to correctly compute the curvature compared to χ = 0. Table 4.2 shows
the diﬀerence in error percentages between successive values of χ for the case when
σ = 0.001 kgs−2.
The diﬀerence in error percentages is seen to decrease drastically
with each successive increase of χ. A similar trend is observed for σ = 0.01 kgs−2 and
σ = 0.1 kgs−2; the successive percentage error diﬀerence is always large between χ = 0
and χ = 1 but only decreases gradually as χ increases. It can be postulated from this

Figure 4.4: Comparison between the nonphysical velocity estimates from the un-

Though this is the case, choosing a value of χ that is very large will result in over-
smoothing of the volume fraction ﬁeld which will result in a loss of the resolution of the
curvature. Under-smoothing will also result in the pressure either being underestimated
or overestimated. To avoid over-smoothing or under-smoothing of the volume fraction
ﬁeld a value of χ = 3 is chosen as the optimal smoothing variable as the diﬀerence in
error percentages between χ = 3 and χ = 4 is very small.
A comparison of the time averaged nonphysical velocities contour plots is shown in
Figure 4.4(a-d). When the surface tension coeﬃcient is kept constant and χ is varied
it is observed that the magnitude of the nonphysical velocities is decreased. A decrease
in the nonphysical velocities gives a better estimate of the pressure diﬀerence.
The
magnitude of the nonphysical velocities is found to increase with the surface tension
coeﬃcient (c-d). At σ = 0.1 kgs−2 the magnitude of the nonphysical velocities is high

enough to introduce oscillations at the interface such that at the end of the simulation
the sphere begins to move.
4.2
Test case: droplet impact onto a liquid-liquid interface
The SMMVOF method was introduced primarily to prevent the numerical/nonphysical
coalescence that is inherent in the standard VOF method. It was shown in Chapter 3,
Section 3.1 that the standard VOF method would require a high resolution computa-
tional grid to resolve the existence of the thin ﬁlm that prevails between two particles
that make contact during a collision. To test the method it is essential to demonstrate
that the nonphysical coalescence that will otherwise result with the VOF method is
prevented.
Mohamed-Kassim and Longmire (2003) studied experimentally the eﬀect of the Reynolds
number on the impact of a single droplet onto a liquid-liquid interface. The droplet fell
through the liquid and on impact deformed together with the liquid-liquid interface.
The surrounding ﬂuid was trapped between the interfaces to form a thin liquid ﬁlm
which prevented immediate coalescence. The secondary purpose of the experiment was
to provide the experimental data needed “to test numerical simulations that attempt
to resolve or model eﬀects associated with the thin ﬁlm.”
In the next section the
experimental set-up considered by Mohamed-Kassim and Longmire (2003) is discussed
in detail.
4.2.1
Experimental set-up
A 0.4 m square cross section transparent tank with a height of 0.3m was ﬁlled with a
mixture of water and glycerine up to a height of 0.13 m. A large tank was used to ensure
that the interfacial waves that formed during impact on the liquid-liquid interface were
negligible. Silicon oil was then poured into the tank for a height of 0.1 m. Two types
of silicon oils that diﬀered in ﬂuid viscosity were used in the experiment. In this study
the silicon oil with the higher viscosity is considered: this corresponds to Combination
1 of the experimental set-up and results of Mohamed-Kassim and Longmire (2003).
Table 4.3 gives the experimental material properties. A water and glycerine mixture
droplet with an eﬀective diameter of 0.0103 m was injected with a syringe into the
Silicon oil. Titanium dioxide particles were seeded into the tank to track the motion of
the liquid and PIV was used to determine interface locations and ﬂuid velocities.
The droplet was observed to impact the liquid-liquid interface at a normal impact veloc-
ity of wi = 0.132 ms−1 which was also observed to be the experimental terminal velocity

Computational set-up
The published computational studies that have been compared against the above ex-
periment include those by Zheng et al. (2005), N´estor Balc´azar et al. (2014), Mohamed-
Kassim et al. (2004) and Coyajee and Boersma (2009).
Zheng et al. (2005) used a two-dimensional numerical simulation to test their adaptive
re-meshing for a ﬁnite-element LS simulation using a square computational domain. The
droplet impact time was delayed and they shifted their results by -1.1s. N´estor Balc´azar
et al. (2014) used Combination 1 of the experiment to test the accuracy of their Multiple-
Marker Level Set method (MLS). A cylindrical domain with dimensions 8D × 10D and
a total of 6 × 106 hexahedral cells were used with no-slip boundary conditions at the
top and bottom of the cylindrical domain. The material properties and experimental
parameters matched those of the experiment exactly.

Figure 4.5: Schematic representation of the computational set-up
In the work of Mohamed-Kassim et al. (2004) a phase ﬁeld approach was compared to a
LS method with adaptive mesh reﬁnement. The droplet was placed at an initial distance
of 3D to the interface and similar to Zheng et al. (2005) an initial droplet velocity of −wi
was set inside the droplet and zero everywhere else. They observed that the distance
between the lower droplet interface and the liquid-liquid interface was smaller compared
to the experiment and concluded that it was a consequence of initializing the droplet
too close to the liquid-liquid interface. In the experiment the droplet reached a terminal
velocity and shape before impact. Coyajee and Boersma (2009) tested their Multiple-
Marker CLSVOF method with three-dimensional simulations of both Combination 1 and
Combination 2 (the lower viscosity ratio) on a 5D × 5D × 10D computational domain.
The computational arrangement of Coyajee and Boersma (2009) is adopted for this work
with the droplet initialized at a height of 9D to ensure that terminal velocity is attained
before impact.
The computational domain is deﬁned to have dimensions of 5D × 5D × 10D with the
liquid-liquid interface at 2.5D and the initial droplet height at 9D. Figure 4.5 shows the
computational arrangement with the description of the multiple volume fraction ﬁelds
and the coordinate axes. The droplet itself is assigned the value α1 = 1, the liquid layer
assigned α2 = 1 and the surrounding silicon oil α3 = 1. A 150 × 150 × 300 structured
cartesian mesh is used.
The initial velocity of the droplet and the surrounding ﬂuid is initialized to 0 ms−1 and
the gravitational acceleration set to 9.8 ms−2 downwards. A no-slip velocity boundary
condition is employed with zero gradient pressure boundary condition on all walls.
The solution is obtained by the SMMVOF method with χ = 3. The computational
domain is decomposed into 16 domains and run in parallel for 31 hours.

4.2.3
Numerical results
As mentioned before all the results are reported in non-dimensional units. The experi-
mental results provide detailed interface deformation information of the droplet trajec-
tory before and after the impact. Figure 4.6 shows the shape proﬁles of the drop and
interface from the experiment (left) (Mohamed-Kassim and Longmire, 2003) and the
simulation (right).
At t/ti = 0 (Figure 4.6 (b)) the shape proﬁles between the experimental and numerical
results diﬀer, which may suggest that the droplet has not attained a terminal velocity
or terminal shape. As the simulation proceeds there is qualitative agreement in the
shape proﬁles. The normalized centre line location of the upper, lower and liquid-liquid
interfaces are shown in Figure 4.7 (a) and the normalized droplet thickness Dh/D (Dh
is deﬁned as the distance between the upper and lower droplet interfaces) is shown in
Figure 4.7 (b). The horizontal line in Figure 4.7 (a) at z/D = 0 corresponds to the
position of the liquid-liquid interface while the vertical line at t/ti = 0 corresponds to
the impact time deﬁned earlier as the time when the lower droplet interface crosses the
quiescent liquid layer.
The experimental results show that the liquid-liquid interface starts to deform before
the lower droplet interface crosses z/D = 0. The numerical centre line location of the
liquid-liquid interface also starts to deform before the actual impact but exhibits a much
higher deformation from time -2 to 0. From time 0 to 2 the liquid-liquid interface attains
its maximum deformation and the corresponding centre line position of the lower droplet
interface also attains its minimum position. The maximum deformation of the liquid-
liquid interface is underestimated. The centre line position at the upper droplet interface
undergoes very small oscillations as the droplet continues to descend into the interface.
From time 2 to 6 the droplet completes a single oscillation cycle. An overestimation
of the centre line position of all the interfaces is observed. After the droplet attains
its lowest position it ascends more rapidly for the numerical results compared to the
experiment. Excellent agreement is observed after the droplet ascends as it starts to
settle to a resting position at times 4 to 8.
The droplet settles at a slightly lower
position as seen from times 8 to 10.
The diﬀerence between the centre line position of the lower and upper droplet interface
gives the droplet height as shown in Figure 4.7 (b). The measure of drop deformation is
given by the normalized droplet width and height. There is excellent agreement between
experimental and numerical results. At impact t/ti = 0 the droplet height does not agree
with the experimental result – there is an underestimate in the centre line positions of

Figure 4.8: Droplet Reynolds number
Figure 4.8 gives the Reynolds number Re as a function of time. At the start of the
simulation Re is zero, corresponding to the initial droplet velocity.
It decreases as
the simulation proceeds, almost achieving a terminal velocity.
From the experiment
the droplet attains a terminal velocity before it impacts the liquid-liquid interface. At
impact time t/ti = 0, Re starts to increase as the droplet comes into contact with
the liquid-liquid interface. After impact the droplet is slowed down and undergoes a
complete oscillation cycle before coming to a resting position.
From Figure 4.8 the droplet numerical impact velocity is found to be 0.082ms−1 down-
wards which is an underestimate of the experimental impact velocity by 38.2%.

Table 4.5 gives a comparison between the current study to the numerical results of Coy-
ajee and Boersma (2009).
The numerical results obtained by Coyajee and Boersma
(2009) agreed with the experimental results but at a higher computational cost. They
simulated both combinations from Mohamed-Kassim et al. (2004) over 10 days. In the
present work the numerical simulation is obtained in 31 hours. The reduced computa-
tional time may be a result of using a SMMVOF method rather than using a CLSVOF
method which is computationally intensive as it requires re-initialization of the distance
function to keep the LS function smooth every time step.
Overall there is a good qualitative agreement of the numerical and experimental results.
The SMMVOF method is able to provide reasonable results with a practical grid size.
4.3
Test case: Tetradecane droplet impact in 1 atm Nitro-
gen
The validation test case used here is a binary collision of hydrocarbon droplets (Pan et al.,
2008) with diﬀerent Weber numbers that result in either coalescence or rebound. The
experimental results provide detailed interface deformation information of the collision
event. The experiment is chosen because detailed interface deformation of the collisions
that result in coalescence will demonstrate the ability of the Reynolds equation to model
the drainage of the thin liquid ﬁlm up to the point of determined rupture. The numerical
results will demonstrate that the surface thin ﬁlm model coupled to the SMMVOF
method is capable of simulating collisions that result in physical coalescence at a reduced
computational cost.
4.3.1
Experimental set-up
Here we describe the experiment of Pan et al. (2008) involving the head-on collision of
two Tetradecane (C14H30) droplets in 1 atm Nitrogen. The experimental set-up was
such that identical droplets were generated by nozzles and time resolved images of their
motion and collisions taken. The outcome – either coalescence or rebound – together
with the ﬁlm drainage times are known from the experiment.
Four test cases were
studied: the ﬁrst two describe droplet coalescence and rebound with minimal droplet
deformation while the last two describe these processes with large deformations in the
droplet shapes. The material properties of Tetradecane and air are shown in Table 4.6
and a set of physical quantities, viz. individual droplet velocity U0, droplet radius R
and the Weber number We = 2ρU2

mesh is discretized into 360 × 80 cells in the x and z directions (Figure 4.9).

The boundary conditions for the pressure are set to zero gradient at the walls with an
internal air pressure set to 101.325 kPa. A no-slip velocity boundary condition is imposed
at the walls. Since the droplet radii are of the order O(10−6), gravity is negligible in
comparison with surface tension forces and the term ρg in the momentum equation is
neglected.
4.3.3
Numerical results
The numerical solution is obtained by following the solution procedure outlined in Chap-
ter 3 Section 3.4.2. The solution as described there requires the knowledge of two param-
eters: ξ and hCrit. ξ aﬀects the geometric determination of hEst and hCrit determines
the width at which the thin liquid ﬁlm is ruptured. The parameter ξ is a universal
setting for the method, and hCrit is a universal property of the materials involved, in-
dependent of the type of collision. We now turn our attention to the determination of
these constants.
4.3.3.1
Selection of parameter ξ
In the calculation of the thin ﬁlm region β, the parameter ξ is required to determine
the mesh cell spacing at which to switch from the geometric determination of the initial
separation distance between droplet interfaces hEst to the solution through the surface
thin ﬁlm model. The restrictions on ξ are that it should be big enough that the geometric
determination spans several mesh cells to make it valid, but it should not be too big
(resulting in β spanning too many mesh cells) because the surface thin ﬁlm model is
valid when the spacing between the droplets is small compared to their radii: h ≪R.
It is thus essential that the results are not sensitive to the value of ξ used in the sim-
ulations. The switch-over point from the geometric determination to the solution of
the surface thin ﬁlm equations should take place at a separation distance where both
methods are valid. The necessary condition for this is that the results should not be
sensitive to the switch-over point in this range.
The values of ξ are chosen from the set of natural numbers excluding zero, one and two.
A value of zero corresponds to the thin ﬁlm region reducing to β = 0 which will not
allow for the geometric determination of hEst and thus the surface thin ﬁlm model will
never switch on. The cases of ξ = 1, 2 are not considered because it is assumed that
these are too few mesh cells to provide a valid and realistic estimate for the geometrically
determined hEst.

Figure 4.10: Thin ﬁlm region β (region in red) for Case I with ξ = 3
The selection of ξ is determined by considering the sensitivity of the minimum predicted
thin ﬁlm thickness to the selection of ξ. Therefore, to determine ξ, the value of hCrit is
set to zero, and the numerical solution to Cases I-IV is obtained with ξ = 3, 4, 5. The
minimum ﬁlm thickness is obtained at every time step and plotted over non-dimensional
time as shown in Figure 4.11(a-d). Since the minimum ﬁlm thickness will not equal zero
the interfaces will not be merged and a behaviour of the thin ﬁlm thickness as a function
of ξ is observed. The physical representation of β is shown in Figure 4.10 with ξ = 3 for
Case I of the experiment.
The variation over non-dimensional time of the minimum ﬁlm thickness with varying
values of ξ is plotted in Figure 4.11(a-d) for the four test cases. In all the four test
cases, as the droplets move closer to each other (hEst ≤ξ∆x) the switch over from the
geometric determination to the solution of h using the surface thin ﬁlm model occurs.
The thin ﬁlm thickness decreases as can be seen from Figure 4.11(a-d). The case for
ξ = 3 gives a higher estimate of the minimum ﬁlm thickness compared to the estimate
provided by ξ = 4 and ξ = 5. The ﬁlm drains and subsequently the thickness starts to
increase as the droplets begin to move apart in preparation for rebound.

very small change is observed between ξ = 4 and ξ = 5. It is therefore deduced that
the results become independent of ξ in the region of 4 ≤ξ ≤5, and a value of ξ = 4 is
chosen.
4.3.3.2
Selection of parameter hCrit
The parameter hCrit deﬁnes the critical thin ﬁlm thickness at which the ﬁlm becomes
unstable and ruptures. The values of the minimum thin ﬁlm thickness for ξ = 4 for the
coalescence test cases as highlighted in Table 4.8 are used to determine hCrit.
The determination of hCrit is similar to that of ξ, hCrit is initially set to zero and
the numerical results at ξ = 4 are obtained for the four test cases. From Table 4.8,
for coalescence to occur for Case I the critical ﬁlm thickness should be greater than
1.618 ×10−7m while for Case IV the critical ﬁlm thickness should be greater than 1.382
×10−7m. On the other hand, to prevent coalescence in Case II, the critical ﬁlm thickness
should be less than 3.872×10−7m and in Case III it should be less than 2.573×10−7m.

Chapter 4: Validation
72
A global hCrit that is applicable to all four test cases is sought: a value such that
1.618×10−7m < hCrit < 2.573×10−7m must be selected. The critical ﬁlm thickness
selected to obtain the numerical results is hCrit = 1.650×10−7m. Thus according to the
solution procedure of the surface thin ﬁlm model outlined in Chapter 3, Section 3.4.2,
when min(h) < hCrit = 1.650 × 10−7m the volume fraction ﬁelds are merged.
Pan et al. (2008) calculated the minimum ﬁlm thickness for the cases resulting in merging
to be 2 × 10−7m. In this study the minimum ﬁlm thickness for the cases that result in
merging is 1.618 × 10−7m for Case I and 1.382 × 10−7m for Case IV. The current study
under predicts the minimum thin ﬁlm thickness by 19.1% for Case I and by 30.9% for
Case IV compared to the study of Pan et al. (2008). The numerical results of Mason
et al. (2014) used a critical ﬁlm thickness of 0.4 × 10−7m in obtaining the numerical
results.
Chen and Yang (2014) used the head-on collision resulting in bouncing to test their
adaptive mesh reﬁnement technique using an axisymmetric simulation. Their minimum
cell spacing used in their simulations was roughly 0.15 × 10−7m and a minimum gas
ﬁlm thickness of 3 × 10−7m was calculated. In the current study the minimum thin
ﬁlm thickness obtained for the bounce test cases is 3.872 × 10−7m for Case II and
2.573 × 10−7m for Case III with a minimum mesh cell spacing of 0.682 × 10−3m. The
present study over-predicts the minimum ﬁlm thickness by 29.1% for Case II and under
predicts by 14.2% for Case III compared to the study of Chen and Yang (2014) but at
a much more reasonable minimum mesh cell spacing.
4.3.3.3
Droplet time series plots
The chosen parameters of ξ and hCrit in the previous two sub-sections are used to obtain
the numerical solution. The time series droplet interface shape plots for the four test
cases are given in Figure 4.12 – Figure 4.16. The time series is given at nondimensional
times, normalized by the droplet oscillation period T.
The simulated results of Case I qualitatively agree well with the experimental results
before coalescence occurs. The droplet deformation is a function of the ﬁlm drainage
time, the time at which the thin ﬁlm becomes unstable and ruptures. In their numerical
simulation using the front tracking method, (Pan et al., 2008) noted that an earlier
or later ﬁlm drainage time results in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent physical deformation fea-
tures. They obtained the correct physical deformation by setting the rupture time to
the experimental rupture time. The ﬁlm is ruptured when the critical ﬁlm thickness is
hCrit = 1.650 × 10−7m.

Chapter 4: Validation
73
Mason et al. (2014) studied the interaction between a droplet and an interface driven
by buoyancy. Their model coupled the CSF method in the framework of a LS method
to a lower dimensional thin ﬁlm equation based on lubrication theory. Their numerical
results also showed a sensitive dependence of the collision dynamics to the ﬁlm drainage
time as observed from the results leading to coalescence of the present study.
The time series droplet interface shapes of Case II agree qualitatively with the experi-
mental results with a slight delay in the dynamics after the droplets attain maximum
deformation while they are still together. This delay is evident from 1.250 – 1.500 during
the rebound stage. The droplets in this test case never attain the critical ﬁlm thickness
and thus the α equations are never set equal and thus no merging occurs.
As with Case II, the time series droplet interface shapes of Case III agrees qualitatively
with the experimental results during the ﬁrst two stages. As the droplets approach each
other a larger deformation in the droplet shape is observed compared to Case II. During
time period 1.083 – 1.806 is when the droplets start to rebound, there is evident delay
in the dynamics.
Cases II and III demonstrate the ability of the SMMVOF method to successfully simulate
collisions that result in rebound. The minimum ﬁlm thickness in these cases was found
to be of the order O(10−7) which is much less than a single mesh cell spacing – the
minimum mesh cell spacing being of the order O(10−3).
Similar to Case I, Case IV numerical results agree qualitatively only up to coalescence.
The coalescence in the simulation occurs earlier than the experimental coalescence which
results in a lag in the deformation features after the coalescence as seen from time 0.606
– 0.703.
4.4
Closure
In this chapter the three aspects to the model for simulating particle-particle interactions
that result in either coalescence or rebound were tested and validated.
The diﬀusive type smoother was applied to a static two-dimensional sphere to test
whether the magnitude of nonphysical velocities would decrease. The numerical results
of the time averaged pressure were compared to the analytic Young-Laplace equation and
it was found that an increase in the smoothing parameter χ provided a better estimate
for the pressure. This demonstrated that the curvature was being correctly calculated.
This resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the magnitude of the nonphysical velocities.

Chapter 4: Validation
74
The validated diﬀusive type smoother with a smoothing parameter value of χ = 3 was
used as a basis for the SMMVOF method.
The SMMVOF method was tested by simulating the gravity driven droplet impact
onto a liquid-liquid interface. Excellent qualitative results of the droplet deformation
were observed and compared to the experiment of Pan et al. (2008). The results were
obtained at a reduced computational cost compared to the numerical study of Coyajee
and Boersma (2009). The numerical results demonstrated that the SMMVOF method
was capable of simulating interactions that result in rebound.
The validated SMMVOF method was used as a basis for the reduced-order surface thin
ﬁlm model. It was demonstrated that coupled to the SMMVOF method the surface thin
ﬁlm model provides a model that is capable of simulating droplet-droplet interaction
that results in coalescence. The droplet time series plots agreed qualitatively with the
experimental results. The model parameter ξ was chosen so that overall the thin ﬁlm
model does not exhibit sensitive dependence on the initial thin ﬁlm thickness estimate
hEst.

Conclusions
The focus of this study has been to develop, implement and test a computational model
in the OpenFOAM R⃝framework, that determines the outcomes of particle-particle in-
teractions. The goal has been to follow a multiscale method by using a DNS approach
based on a smoothed VOF method that correctly computes interface curvatures to model
the particle-particle interactions on the particle scale at a fundamental level, but by em-
ploying a surface thin ﬁlm model to study the dynamics on the thin liquid ﬁlm scale, to
drastically reduce the computational eﬀort that would otherwise be required.

Summary
5.1.1
Motivation
Particle-particle interactions within dispersed multiphase ﬂows are a common occurrence
in industrial processes. The hydrodynamic interaction of these particles which can lead
to either coalescence or rebound inﬂuence the overall particle density in a multiphase
reactor which in turn inﬂuences the operating eﬃciency. The CFD methods such as the
Euler-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange formulations used to study these processes often on
a large scale are known to use empirical correlations whenever modelling the interactions
that result in either coalescence or rebound. Understanding and correctly modelling the
underlying physics of the collision event at a fundamental level could vastly improve the
operating eﬃciency of such processes.
The multiphase volume tracking conservative VOF method was chosen as it solves for
the simulated motion of the particle-ﬂuid interface at a fundamental level with rea-
sonable computational cost. As it stands however, the VOF method has two major
80

drawbacks: the inability to compute interface curvatures accurately and the inability to
model particle coalescence correctly.
5.1.2
Fluid ﬂow modelling
The governing equations for dispersed multiphase ﬂow were deduced from volume av-
eraging the conservation equations for each individual phase. The resultant equations
were the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous multiphase Newtonian
ﬂuid undergoing laminar and isothermal three-dimensional ﬂow. The VOF method was
introduced to provide closure to the system of governing equations while the surface
tension force was introduced using the CSF method.
Discretization followed the FVM using an implicit Euler method which resulted in a
system of algebraic equations solved iteratively with the pressure being converged at
every time step using a pressure correction algorithm (PISO).
Inherent to the VOF method are the nonphysical velocities that arise from a numerical
inconsistency of inaccurately calculating interface curvatures with the CSF method. To
reduce their magnitude a diﬀusive type smoother was introduced and coupled to the
standard VOF method. This introduced an artiﬁcial smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld
that was smeared over a number of mesh cells χ. The smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld
was deﬁned over more mesh cells compared to the standard volume fraction ﬁeld which
gave it a smooth transition rather than a step function.
This method was implemented into OpenFOAM R⃝and a numerical static sphere test
case was simulated. The sphere was placed in a two-dimensional square with assumed
negligible gravity. The eﬀect of the smoothing parameter ξ on the ability of the method
to calculate the pressure diﬀerence across the sphere was evaluated together with the
eﬀect this has on the magnitude of the nonphysical velocities. A sensitivity study was
done to determine the optimal value of ξ.
5.1.3
Particle interaction modelling
The ﬁlm drainage theory was adopted in this study to argue the presence of a thin
liquid ﬁlm between interfaces of two particles and the resultant need to resolve the ﬂow
variables at very small length scales.
A test was performed that checked how well the VOF method correctly reconstructed
the interfaces of two particles that are within half a mesh cell spacing of each other.
It was found that the VOF accuracy increased with the number of computational cells

used. This highlighted the need to excessively reﬁne the computational grid in the region
of the thin liquid ﬁlm if the smoothed VOF method is used to study particle interaction.
For coarse computational grids the interfaces were observed to merge in what has been
referred to in the literature as “artiﬁcial” or “numerical coalescence”.
The governing equations for the smoothed VOF method were extended to include mul-
tiple volume fraction ﬁelds to form the SMMVOF method. This method diﬀers from
previous methods in the literature because it uses a smooth VOF method to accurately
compute curvatures while other methods are based on a CLSVOF or a LS method. The
SMMVOF method was implemented in OpenFOAM R⃝and tested by simulating the
gravity-driven three-dimensional droplet impact onto a liquid interface.
Although successful in preventing numerical coalescence, the SMMVOF method is in-
capable of simulating interactions that result in coalescence. A surface thin ﬁlm model
based on the Reynolds equation from lubrication theory was coupled to the SMMVOF
method to calculate the critical ﬁlm thickness that would determine the outcome of a
collision. The equation resolved the thin ﬁlm explicitly thus there was no need to use
very ﬁne computational grids.
The method was validated by simulating the collisions of Tetradecane droplets which re-
sult in either coalescence or rebound, and predicted a critical ﬁlm thickness in agreement
with the experimental results of Pan et al. (2008).
The implementation in this study uses the pressure from the Navier-Stokes equations
as an input into the thin-ﬁlm model. The ﬁlm model is initialised with a grid-scale
ﬁlm thickness and thereafter allowed to solve independently on the sub-grid scale with
pressure as the only input. This is in contrast to the similar technique of Mason et al.
(2012) where velocity boundary conditions from the grid-scale ﬂow model are applied
to the ﬁlm model, which is then used to solve for pressure. For this work, this approach
was considered as problematic given the attempt to maintain tight coupling between ve-
locities on diﬀerent scales, and the great diﬀerence in magnitude between ﬂow velocities
and the small boundary velocity of the thinning ﬁlm.
5.2
Findings
The following were the main ﬁndings of this work:
• The diﬀusive type smoother was successful in reducing the magnitude of nonphys-
ical velocities and providing an accurate pressure diﬀerence estimate.

Chapter 5. Conclusion
83
• The success of the diﬀusive type smoothing algorithm can be attested by the
reduction of the nonphysical velocities compared to the standard OpenFOAM R⃝
solver interFoam. The smoothing algorithm was highly dependent on the number
of cells over which the smoothing was performed with the parameter χ, the ideal
value being χ = 3.
• An increase in the smoothing coeﬃcient decreased the magnitude of the nonphys-
ical velocities. As reported in the literature, an increase in the surface tension
coeﬃcient increased the magnitude of the velocities. This supports claims that
the VOF method struggles to simulate surface tension driven ﬂows, examples in-
cluding microﬂuidic ﬂows. With the diﬀusive type smoother tested it was used as
a basis for the multiple marker VOF method.
• The SMMVOF was tested and excellent qualitative agreement between the nu-
merical and experimental results was observed.
• The computational time required by this implementation was drastically less than
those reported in the literature for the other implementations.
• Excellent qualitative agreement in the centre line positions of the lower and upper
droplet interfaces together with the droplet interface deformation shapes was ob-
served. The SMMVOF method does not introduce any empirical or user deﬁned
parameters and was successful in preventing the numerical coalescence that is an
artefact of the VOF method whenever interfaces were too close.
• The solution obtained by the SMMVOF method was found to improve with an
increase in the mesh cell spacing but excellent results were obtained with relatively
coarse computational grids.
• The collision of Tetradecane droplets in 1 atm Nitrogen was successfully simulated
using the SMMVOF method coupled with the surface thin ﬁlm model to determine
the outcome of the collision event. The collision outcome was found to be highly
dependent on the critical ﬁlm thickness used. The actual rupture time determined
the evolution and shape deformation that followed. Qualitative agreement of the
collision sequence for the four Tetradecane test cases was observed.
• The calculated minimum ﬁlm thickness was found to be independent of the initial
ﬁlm thickness estimate.
• The results of the current study demonstrated the predictive power of the surface
thin ﬁlm model. Although the critical ﬂim thickness was set based on the exper-
imental data, the results agreed with all four sets of experiments of Pan et al.

Chapter 5. Conclusion
84
(2008) under diﬀerent collision conditions. By comparison, only a single exper-
iment was compared against in the work of Mason et al. (2012), and the result
used for the critical ﬁlm thickness in that study was an order of magnitude smaller
than that deduced by Pan et al. from experimental data, and the value obtained
in the present study. This diﬀerence is attributed to the diﬀerent approach used
for coupling the ﬂow model and thin ﬁlm equation, with only the pressure and not
the velocity being coupled between the scales.
5.3
Recommendations for further study
A feasibility study on the number of particles the SMMVOF method can handle can
be of great interest in determining its use for the study of bubble interactions in real
bubble column reactors.
Further work can be directed towards performing multiscale simulations where the
present model is used to validate the closure relations in the Euler-Euler or Euler-
Lagrange type simulations of dispersed multiphase ﬂow.
The surface thin ﬁlm model did not include any short range forces such as the London
van der Waals but the numerical results for the Tetradecane collision sequences agreed
with the model. The minimum thin ﬁlm thickness for the four Cases considered was of
the order O(10−7) which is much higher than the range required for the forces to be
dominant. Further work would be to include the forces in the model for situations when
the thickness is below O(10−7).
Thin ﬁlm dimpling was not studies because of the assumption of plane parallel interfaces,
a further study comparing the numerical results of the thin ﬁlm evolution with and
without the assumption could give insights into dimple formation.
