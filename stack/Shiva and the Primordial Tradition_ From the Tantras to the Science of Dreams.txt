is permanent] the divine is everywhere present [in flowers,
birds, animals, in forests, in man].
II—Enjoy fully what the god concedes to you and never
covet what belongs to others [neither their goods, nor
their talent, nor their success].

A
EDITOR’S PREFACE
The Ferryman’s Task of
Alain Daniélou
n essayist, musicologist, Sanskritist, and philosopher, Alain Daniélou was
also professor of the Benares Hindu University from 1949 to 1953,
honorary member of the Institut Français d’Indologie from 1943 on,
Director of the Library of Manuscripts at Adyar in 1954, and member of
the École Française d’Extrême-Orient from 1956 to 1960, before he became the
director of the Institute of Comparative Musicology in Berlin and Venice up to
1977. In 1991, the Ambassador of India in Rome handed him an edict engraved
on a copper plate making him the first Westerner to belong to the famous
Sangeet Natak Academy. He passed away in 1994 covered with honors: the
Légion d’honneur, Professor Emeritus of the City of Berlin, Commandeur des
Arts et des Lettres (at the same time as Ravi Shankar, who dedicated to him the
concert he gave on that occasion in Paris at the Théatre des Champs Élysées).
Daniélou has left behind him an exceptional work, translated and well-
known in many countries, both in the field of comparative musicology and the
safeguarding of “World Music” (the title of the collection of records he created
for UNESCO), as well as in the field of Indian philosophy and culture. His
bibliography includes books that have been classics for many years—such as his
encyclopedic Hindu Polytheism (republished with the title The Myths and Gods
of India); Shiva and Dionysus; Virtue, Success, Pleasure, Liberation—The Four
Aims of Life; as well as While the Gods Play—works that have been translated,
particularly in the United States, where they have been published by Inner
Traditions or in the Bollingen series of Princeton University.1
If we add to these texts his scholarly translations in French from seminal
Sanskrit and Tamil works, it is strange that his memory was not more honored
by the academic world at the time of his death. In this regard, the Encyclopaedia
Universalis was fully justified in concluding the long article devoted to him in

1995 with the words, “Bewildered by such a multi-faceted approach, university
circles have mostly kept Alain Daniélou aloof.”
What was Alain Daniélou’s approach? It can be summed up in a sentence:
For more than fifteen years, he practiced only Sanskrit and Hindi, immersing
himself in the traditional society of India and its scholars, which gave him access
to commentaries on texts transmitted orally, parallel to official Hinduism.
From this, it is easy to understand how far Daniélou was from ordinary
university research patterns and, consequently, that what he can teach us is
exceptional.
If Daniélou had access to texts and commentaries that are never—in
traditional society—taught ex cathedra, and still less published, it is because he
had no other goal than the research itself and was deemed trustworthy by those
circles of traditional scholars and metaphysicians, who are similar to those who
disappeared during the Middle Ages in the West and to those who may survive
today in Sufi confraternities tolerated by Islam, which the history of mystic
poetry tells us were often persecuted.
During his long stay in traditional India, which up to his last days he
considered as his true homeland, Daniélou gradually acquired rules of life and
ways of thinking that are very different from those of the society in which he
was born at the beginning of the century. A rite of initiation marked the frontier,
the second birth, of this Westerner who descended from one of the oldest
families of Europe, related to Shakespeare’s “Dukes of Clamor.” As he recounts
with great humor in his memoirs, The Way to the Labyrinth, he was the son of a
very Catholic mother, founder of a religious order, and an anticlerical father,
several times a minister in the French Third Republic. His brother was a famous
cardinal and he himself, to use his own expression, was “an apostate of some
renown,” who became assimilated into Hinduism, which does not proselytize
and to which, in principle, one does not convert.
Such an adhesion to the object of research is almost unknown in the
university approach, set on the “critical distance.” His adherence can best be
understood in the artistic domain, in considering Gauguin and his metaphysical
Tahitian universe, which the colonization and the missions of his own time were
busy destroying.
Daniélou’s approach relates first and foremost to the traditional quest, which
aims at identifying the seeker with the object of his search, or—if one prefers—
of the initiate with knowledge. On several occasions in The Way to the
Labyrinth, Daniélou writes that in India he sought nothing, neither career,
honors, nor “powers.” Just so, he sought nothing, except to understand a
civilization thousands of years old, a traditional society similar to the most

brilliant civilizations that are no more, which has remained intact, with its social
structures, cults, metaphysical and philosophical systems, its arts, the fresh air of
its diversity. As the Upanishads say—and this is something that he often quoted
—“In all things, leveling means death.”
Daniélou, who had practiced Western dance and singing at a professional
level before arriving in India in the thirties, began by learning Indian music
under a traditional master, with whom he communicated in Hindi. Since in
traditional India—as in Pythagorean thought—music is considered the
fundamental key to knowledge, Daniélou ended up meeting the scholars and
wandering monks who always gather at Benares, the “heart of the Hindu world”:
After I had learned to speak and write Hindi fairly well, Vijayanand
Tripathi, one of the great scholars of Benares, was kind enough to take
interest in me and answer the numerous questions I had been asking
myself… . Every evening, he taught from a raised platform in front of his
house to a group of followers from many different castes assembled there.
He had been the disciple of a famous Yogi and, besides classical
philosophy, rituals, and interpretation of texts, he knew the most secret
aspects of Tantric doctrines and Yoga practices. In his public lectures, he
explained the episodes and the hidden meanings of the famous Ramayana
in Hindi, written by the great poet Tulsi Das.
It did not take me long to discover that this austere scholar had a
completely open mind with whom one could discuss not only topics such
as human sacrifices, omophagia, and erotic rites, but also the origins of
language, cosmology, and Indian theories on the nature of the world, the
atom, time, and space… .
Little by little I entered into a mode of thinking so subtle, so complex,
and so difficult that I sometimes felt myself reaching the limits of my
mental faculties and capacity for understanding. I found myself immersed
in a society whose conceptions of nature, of the divine, of morality, love,
and wisdom were so radically different from those of the world where I
was born that I had to make a clean sweep of everything I thought I
knew… . This system of values could not have been more strange to me if
I had been miraculously transported into Egypt during the reign of Ramses
II.2
Literary people know well how difficult it has become to understand certain
texts, such as Dante’s Divine Comedy, or the Roman de la Rose, now that the
traditional keys are lost, because esoteric knowledge was annihilated in the West

in the fourteenth century, eradicated by an ecclesiastical institution crazed for
temporal power—as Marguerite Yourcenar has so admirably shown in L’Œuvre
au noir— an institution that did not, alas, restrict its inquisition to the frontiers of
Europe.
That is why it is almost a miracle that a Westerner should have been able to
renew this thread that was believed to have been completely lost. In this respect I
wish to emphasize how decisive Alain Daniélou’s loyalty has been in sharing
with us the treasures he discovered. By this I mean that, on his return to the
West, he never sought a musical career, for which his abilities made him well
suited, any more than he wished to play at being a “guru” or “initiate,” when it
would have been quite easy for him to do so. Quite the opposite: He set himself
the task of rehabilitating the traditional music of the whole world, not only of
India, but of Morocco, Iran, and Africa, whose ancient traditions were threatened
by ignorance—as always authoritarian and proselytizing—as well as by attempts
to turn their music into folklore, or into study subjects, or to “modernize” it, as in
the former USSR.
At this level, his success was outstanding. If Ravi Shankar or Ali Akbar
Khan have been able to give their concerts in the same halls as Western classical
musicians, if the art of traditional musicians and dancers has now been fully
recognized for many years, without the slightest condescension, we owe it to
Daniélou. As Ms. Noriko Aikawa, the chief of the Intangible Heritage Section at
UNESCO, has clearly declared: “Today, ‘music from far afield’ has become a
reference for many specialists and connoisseurs. These treasures have inspired
many contemporary composers. We owe all this to Alain Daniélou. Today the
existence all over the world, and especially in the Orient, of a music system
which is as classical as that of Bach and Mozart, is universally acknowledged:
we owe that fact too to Alain Daniélou’s farsightedness and unstinting efforts.”3
The results of Daniélou’s approach concern not only musicology and Indian
studies but also his literary creation: Two fictional works, The Gods’ Livestock
and Tales of the Labyrinth, provide us with a precise picture of the world of the
wandering monks (saddhus) and the slightly less known world of the great
traditional scholars of India. A quotation from his preface to The Gods’
Livestock gives a glimpse of the universe behind his tales, in which, he warns us,
all the characters are taken from life:
The parallel world of saddhus, the wandering monks of India, is a world
apart, and their function is to transmit, from age to age, the deepest forms
of an immemorial wisdom, philosophy and traditional sciences. A major
part of this knowledge is kept secret. The saddhus have, however, a duty

to teach—wherever they happen to find themselves, even in the humblest
of villages—the precepts necessary for the maintenance of religious and
moral values. This is why Indian villagers have what seems to us a
surprising level of culture as well as philosophical and theological
preoccupations… . The world of the saddhus remains unchanged whatever
be the transformations of the society around it. The saddhus are the
representatives and wardens of the “eternal religion” (Sanatana Dharma),
which is the primordial source of all religions… . The higher the rank of a
saddhu in the monastic hierarchy, the more secret is his role and the more
difficult it is to approach him. Perhaps at the summit of this hierarchy
exists this mysterious and impersonal being sometimes called the King of
the World, who can never be identified or located. Whenever the earth is
afflicted by the folly of men, it is the duty of this Grand Master of the
saddhus to instill in their minds the knowledge and ambitions through
which they destroy themselves.4
Yet another—and no less direct—contribution of Daniélou’s to the
humanities is his elegant and accurate translation into French of several
masterpieces of Sanskrit and Tamil literature, always carried out with the
assistance of pandits: Gitalamkara, l’ouvrage original de Bharata sur la
musique, the Textes des Purana sur la théorie musicale, published by the French
Institute of Pondichéry, Shiva Svarodaya, the Pièces de théatre de Harsha,
Shilappadikaram, 
included 
in 
Gallimard’s 
UNESCO 
collection, 
and
Manimekhalai, published by New Directions in 1989.5 To this significant list can
be added the first unabridged and unadulterated translation of the Kama Sutra
and its commentaries, carried out in the last four years of his life, for which—
owing to the puritan heritage that the British left to modern India—he was
unable to obtain the assistance of any pandit.
Throughout all of his work, Daniélou emphasizes the need to study the
traditional Indian sciences, to translate them, and to ensure their preservation,
starting with the ancient cosmological theories of Samkhya. He provides a
considerable bibliography on these theories in his While the Gods Play, with the
following presentation:
We do not have the original texts of the ancient Samkhya, which was not
in the Sanskrit language, but we are acquainted with its Dravidian
terminology thanks, in particular, to the Manimekhalai, which is written in
the Tamil language… . The teachings of Kapila, the dark-skinned sage
who was the first to teach the Samkhya in the Aryan world, were collected

by his spiritual heir, the magus Asuri… .
Reconstituted and translated into Sanskrit at the time of the Shaivite
revival, at the beginning of the Christian era, they were the cause of a
prodigious renaissance that lasted until the Islamic invasions in the twelfth
century. Only part of these texts has been published, and very few have
been translated. Sumerian parallels have, moreover, confirmed their
authenticity. The knowledge they reveal about the nature of the universe,
the origin of matter and life, biology, astrophysics, the relations between
thought and language, goes far beyond the most audacious concepts of
modern science… .
According to the concepts of the Samkhyas, the universe is made up of
two fundamental elements, consciousness and energy… . Matter is merely
organized energy. There is no material element that exists without being
inhabited by consciousness. No element of consciousness exists without
an energy-giving support.6
One of Daniélou’s great merits is to have made these notions accessible to
inquisitive minds, especially to Western scholars who are not satisfied by
positivist postulates and do not know where to turn in order to find authentic
traditional knowledge and science. In connection with this interest, it is highly
significant, by way of example, that a mind like Hubert Reeves has given as an
illustration to one of his most famous essays on astrophysics, Patience dans
l’azur, the image of Nataraja (Shiva) dancing in his circle of flames.
Might it not be appropriate to make a careful and objective study of this
notion of generalized interaction, at a time when genetic manipulation and
alterations of the natural world, of which modern humanity deems it is both
master and proprietor, have left the domain of theory and now invade the
industrial market?
Greek cosmogony called our current era the Age of Iron, while Samkhya
labels it the Kali Yuga, or “Dark Age.” It appears that this era—in which
totalitarian religions and military, economic, and bureaucratic dictatorships
multiply and disseminate the means of destruction, poison soil, air, and water,
and plant increasingly visible anguish in everyone’s mind—is also to be the
period in which access to knowledge is most direct and most rapid. In view of
the libraries rising from the ground to reveal the forgotten civilizations of Sumer
and Mohenjo Daro, perhaps the time has come to forget certain university
prejudices, and publish and translate texts like those Daniélou has brought to the
West’s attention.7
This book offers the reader a glimpse into the vast world of Shiva and the

primordial tradition, as seen through the eyes of one who not only studied it but
himself became a part of that tradition. It brings together unpublished works,
papers read at conferences, or articles published in journals by Alain Daniélou
between 1938 and 1991.8 In particular, the texts presented here focus on the
prehistoric religious tradition of Shaivism, root source of both Samkhya as well
as—with Jainism—modern Hinduism.
Many of the texts collected in this book deal with the various facets of the
relationship of Shaivism with the Western world, an essential question, since the
desire to restore such relations and the quest for primordial tradition was at the
very center of the works of the medieval alchemists and those who initiated the
Renaissance movement, such as Alberti and Pico della Mirandola.9
It may be useful to ponder why the quest for harmony, wisdom, and the
transcendental unity of religions—which had animated enquiring minds in the
medieval and renaissance periods—led, on the one hand, to a blind technological
proliferation paired with the terrifying mutation of means of destruction and, on
the other, to a standardized, anthropocentric humanism, which has already
destroyed almost all traditional civilizations and now threatens the planet’s very
existence.
“In losing purity of heart, you lose science,” wrote the alchemist Nicolas de
Valois. It is this perversion of the search for knowledge—to which the semantic
evolution of the terms “science” and “philosophy” bears witness—that holds the
enigma of the violently profane character of the modern world, which does not
appear to be a natural development from the ancient world, but rather a reaction
to the traditional society whose degenerating social structures and religious
dictatorships had straitjacketed thought.
Here it is important to point out—and the first text in the book affirms it—
that “Shaivite philosophy knows no dogma. It does not separate theology and
cosmology, science and religion. Their common aim is to seek to understand the
nature of the world, and the role and destiny of living beings.” Shaivism is
consequently not a “religion” in the sense that we usually use this word; it only
is so, literally, in its free and specific search for what binds human beings to the
universe.
The structure through which Shaivism—whose very name was generally
unknown to the French public before Daniélou’s works were published—has
been transmitted intact in India, with all its apparatus of seminal texts, preserved
through long periods of apparent eclipse, is an initiatic institution: that of the
sannyasis, wandering monks who are the repositories of amazing techniques of
memorization and oral transmission, with whom Alain Daniélou was in contact
for many long years.

Here, too, we must spell out our vocabulary. The sannyasis were—and still
are—free men (and sometimes women) who have renounced earthly possessions
and family life, though not necessarily sensual enjoyment, since, according to
Tantrism, the “Indian cult of ecstasy,” “the union of bodies in the act of love
reflects the union of the cosmic principles and is perhaps our highest experience
of bliss, of that limitless joy that is the nature of the divine.”10
How can one not think of those wandering medieval alchemists, those
“inhabitants of the universe,” who abandoned their place in society to give
themselves over to the mysterious “Art of Love”? Does not the symbolic
conjunction of fire and water, as depicted in a Tantric Indian engraving kept in
the library of the Sorbonne, represent the principal operation of the “Great
Work”? Mircéa Eliade has already shown irrefutable convergences between
tantric hatha yoga and alchemy, which both seek to deliver the mind through
matter and matter through mind.11 They both represent a search, a discipline
aimed at transforming the mortal body into a “divine body,” enlightenment
through the discovery of correspondences between macrocosm and microcosm,
the very vehicle of a research in which “beauty is the splendor of truth.”12
At the same time, these studies are close to poetry, which is dealt with from
various points of view in the texts that follow, such as “The Nature of Beauty
According to the Samkhya,” “Poetry and Metaphysics,” “Music: The Language
of the Gods.” Shaivism’s approach is diametrically opposite to the hatred of the
flesh practiced by the religions of the Book, the murderous dichotomy of body
and spirit, human and nature, which has tormented the whole history of the West
in prisons and on pyres. This is here made very clear by essays such as: “The
Symbolism of the Linga” and “Shaivism and Third Nature,” which reestablish
the metaphysical importance of what Judeo-Christian tradition has relentlessly
inculpated and punished, and what a bourgeois society can only tolerate in the
form of fourth-rate merchandise called: “pornography.”
In the face of these trends we urgently need to hear the voice of Alain
Daniélou reevoking the seers who tell us that: “In the microcosm, sex is the form
in which the nature of the unformed is manifest;” and yet again, “because they
evoke the primordial hermaphrodite, any sexually ambiguous being is of a
sacred nature… . Every bisexual being can be considered as an emanation of the
god’s transcendent aspect.”
The India we discover through Alain Daniélou is a country where
stimulating contradictions coexist, considered as the very expression of the
divine. Moralistic and puritanical Jainism prospers side by side with Dionysian
Shaivism and its cults of trance and ecstasy. Vedism overlays Shaivism and was
influenced by it. Official religion allowed the parallel transmission of the occult

to continue, and it is still the religion of the people and the earliest populations.
Buddhism disappeared from the soil of India as a result of philosophical
contests. Nothing in the subcontinent’s history remotely approaches the religious
and ideological persecutions of Europe and America, or the racial and cultural
genocides that are their contemporary equivalent. In these pages Alain Daniélou
makes it clear that this particular fact is not the result of chance, but of
absolutely scientific research and wisdom:
Samkhya teaches that any method of investigation must first establish the
limits beyond which its conclusions are no longer valid… . Samkhya has
even been deemed atheistic, since it considers that the prime cause of the
universe is non-spatial, and thus non-locatable, impersonal, and
unknowable. Yet the representation of the energy principles … in the form
of more or less anthropomorphic deities is part of a system used for
teaching the masses and making accessible notions that are beyond their
comprehension.
It remains for this presentation to indict most of the images and analyses of
India circulating in the West as false. This subject, dealt with in all Alain
Daniélou’s works, is also tackled here: “Curiously, of India, the home of logic
and the exact sciences, the modern West only retains abstruse speculations and
irrational religiosity, neglecting a whole body of knowledge it would like to
think of as being exclusive to itself.”
The question of source material is essential. Alain Daniélou, who wrote and
spoke Hindi and Sanskrit fluently, who had studied Tamil, was perhaps the only
Westerner who was not only immersed in Indian civilization for more than
twenty years but also was duly initiated and co-opted into the esoteric structures
of traditional Shaivism. He was consequently a beneficiary of its prodigious oral
transmission, certain texts of which he transcribed, which has inspired his whole
work. Although some passages simply say in another way—which is also a way
of making them clearer—what he has said in The Myths and Gods of India or
While the Gods Play, other pages in this book are entirely new:
Animals and plants are in some way the visible part of subtle beings,
spirits, genies and gods, which govern and inhabit them. We can often
make contact with the spirits through their vegetal or animal twin. This is
why certain animals and trees are considered sacred. Through the respect
and love we bear them, as well as their worship, we attract the
benevolence of the subtle spirits, genies, and fairies that are their invisible

twins, governing the aspects of the natural world.
In this dualism of subtle spirits and animals, perception and knowledge
functions are separated. In the human being, the divine game unites these
two aspects; the human animal gradually develops an aptitude for
knowledge, having in some way absorbed its subtle double, or guardian
angel. This is why the human species bears a double heritage: its genetic,
or physical heritage, which perceives external forms and delights in them,
but is also part of the scenario; and its initiatic heritage of knowledge… .
To this he added the following note, specifically for publication with this
book:
The sacred is the telephone directory of the subtle worlds: The magic and
the sacred are the two faces of the same communication theory. When we
consider that the subtle beings are beneficent, we talk of the sacred, if they
are evil or neutral, then we speak of magic.
Nothing outside polytheism can properly be spoken of as “sacred.”
Sacred symbols, sacred rites, sacred places, sacred animals, sacred trees
are inevitably linked to subtle presences referring to real and permanent
entities that we sometimes disguise according to our mythological
conceptions. Murugan, the infant god to whom children are dedicated, will
become Krishna, or the child Jesus; the sacred cave opening on to the
entrails of the mountain goddess Parvati will become the place where
goddesses appear, whether those of the Cretan labyrinth, of Præneste, or
Lourdes.
Never has Alain Daniélou gone so far as he does in these pages in his
revelations of such little known subjects as esoteric Shaivism, the personality of
the great Shankara, Tantrism, the Third Nature, the Science of Dreams, or
initiation13.
JEAN-LOUIS GABIN

A
An Introduction to
Alain Daniélou and the
Discovery of the Divine
lthough on the one hand we may consider Alain Daniélou’s discovery of
India wholly fortuitous, on the other we may deem that he was particularly
destined to do so, especially in view of what he tells us about his youth.
From an early age, Alain Daniélou was very unhappy in his Western
Catholic circle. He launched into artistic activities, such as painting, singing,
playing the piano, dancing, meanwhile showing deep contempt for
“intellectuals” and detaching himself totally from Catholicism.
Throughout the twenties, Alain Daniélou certainly did not seem to be
bothered about metaphysics, religion, mysticism, or philosophy. He sang and
danced, taking rigorous and demanding dance classes at the Saulnier gymnasium
in Montmartre along with the girls from the Moulin Rouge dance troupe. He
gave recitals and lived a vie de bohème among an amusing artistic circle, with
Henri Sauguet, Maurice Sachs (who had just left the seminary), and Max Jacob,
for whom he had a great affection, while being totally disinterested in the poet’s
religious preoccupations.
At the same time, the family influences of his youth, particularly his
mother’s exacerbated Catholicism, were to have a decisive influence on the
young rebel. Whereas his father had to be baptized so that he could get married,
his mother, Madeleine Clamorgan, was very devoted to Pope Pius X. She fought
firmly against the anticlerical government that had just outlawed religious
congregations and set up first a substitute lay order called “Saint François
Xavier,” and then a school—“Sainte Marie”—where the values of Catholic
ethics were very much to the fore.
Madeleine Clamorgan’s brother was a canon, the curé of the church at
Chaillot. Her eldest son Jean became a Jesuit and was made a cardinal by Paul
VI, before becoming a member of the French Academy. Was the young Alain

influenced by it all? He showed interest in some areas of mystery, although far
from any official religion.
In the first chapter of his memoirs,1 entitled “The Discovery of the Divine,”
he writes about a hiding place he created as a very young child in an abandoned
nursery: “Here, alone, I could sense a mystery far greater than that of the
ordinary human world.” Yet again, reflecting on the priory of Resson, he wrote:
“The old chapel held a strange fascination for me. I hated anyone else who came
inside. I would stay there for hours on end, my mind completely blank. The red-
shaded oil lamp threw dancing shadows on the wall. I was not afraid, though I
felt an unknown presence beside me. I would perform all kinds of strange rites,
which seemed guided by some mysterious force. I invented a complete ritual—
was it really invented by me?—and as I lay flat on my stomach with my arms
stretched out in the aisle, I would make a vow. I did not know what it was; when
spirits exercise their will upon one’s mind, they never express themselves
through words. I vaguely sensed that I had been chosen for a special destiny and
must pledge myself to it with no questions asked. That may have been my first
real initiation. I was ten years old.”2
His discovery of India was made accidentally during a memorable voyage
crossing through it to reach Afghanistan, at the invitation of the crown prince, a
friend of his youth, who was to become the king, Mohamed Zaher Shah. During
this trip, he stayed for the first time at Shantiniketan, the school founded by the
poet Rabindranath Tagore in Bengal. Daniélou, who remained very close to the
poet up to the latter’s death, was immediately fascinated by the world he
discovered. His main interest continued to be the arts: dance and—above all—
music. He became rapidly aware, however, that the circle around Tagore was
already greatly Westernized. Little by little, he took an interest in the Hindu
system, its philosophy and religion. Settling at Benares in 1938 was decisive
from this point of view.
The declaration of war in 1939 trapped him in the ancient city of Benares. It
was then that he decided to start studying under the pandits of orthodox Hindu
society. He studied Hindi, Sanskrit, and music.
The influence of a great sannyasi, Swami Karpatri—who was extremely
revered, especially at Benares, where his name appears in bold letters across the
façade of a math, near the temple of Kedargath on the banks of the Ganges—was
to be decisive. It was Karpatri who decided that Alain Daniélou should be
initiated into Hinduism. The initiation took place a few years after his arrival in
the holy city, during the course of a ceremony that was, as he mentions, “quite
simple, like a baptism,” without wishing to say much more. As part of the
initiation he was given the name Shiva Sharan, meaning “the protégé of Shiva.”

From this moment on, everything changed: Alain Daniélou, now Shiva
Sharan, entered wholly into the traditional Hindu system, to the extent of judging
any return to the Western world impossible. He discovered a religion totally
opposed to the monotheistic religions he had come into contact with. He adopted
all the Hindu rules. He rapidly became an ardent defender of this civilization and
declared war on the later monotheistic religions, which he deemed to be
pernicious and dangerous for the destiny of humankind. Their proselytizing,
totalitarian, dogmatic character—unknown to Hinduism—appeared as a
permanent source of conflicts, as recent history so clearly demonstrates.
Despite more than thirty years spent at his side, I always find it difficult to
analyze his progress in the philosophic field (rather than use the word
“spiritual,” which he would not have liked). What is clear is that the more he
learned from Karpatri, the more his conceptions of Hinduism evolved. Although
he acted like a good Hindu, bathing each morning in the Ganges, and a brahman
used to come each day to the palace where he was living to perform a ritual puja,
Daniélou remained extremely modest and reserved about whatever concerned
his own religious practices.
Alain Daniélou rejected Catholicism. His visits to Algeria and Muslim
countries interested him on the musical plane, but never on a religious level,
with the exception of an approach to Sufism during a visit to Iran and his
contacts with René Guénon and Henri Corbin. His discovery of the Hindu world
came upon him as an out-and-out revelation. This religion—as much a
philosophy as a science—was in absolute harmony with his own vision of the
divine.
Was his also an instinctive rejection of all kinds of prophets, spectacular
rituals, masses, pilgrimages, and other gatherings of crowds under the pretext of
religion? Did he not totally refuse to become a guide, a guru for confused
Westerners in quest of oriental spirituality? Did he not consider the temple a
place where qualified priests seek contact with mysterious powers and where the
public has no function? Did he not accept the rites solely as a private relationship
between himself and the gods, without witnesses?
The works he wrote, particularly his memoirs and the Tales of the Ganges,3
denote a decisive orientation toward Shaivism—and doubtless toward Tantrism
as well. Tantrism is, on principle, absolutely secret, so that we consequently
know nothing. At the same time, Daniélou plunges with delight into every
Shaivite text and many of his works allow us to discover concepts that differ
widely from Vedism, the latter referring mainly to the four Vedas, about which
he says very little.
Alain Daniélou sticks to presenting the theological and philosophical

speculations of Shaivism, feeling that he has been designated for this purpose.
He does not feel, however, authorized to teach secret practices, which
Westerners lacking in spirituality would treat merely as exotic approaches.
Shaivism is, at the same time, both the religion of the humble and of the most
esoteric and secret currents of Hinduism. Daniélou was one of the first to present
this religious thought, so little known in the West.
It surprises many, including many Indians, that his view in no way reflects
the most visible currents of Hinduism, nor Western concepts of it, made on the
basis of texts written—as a rule—in English. One example is that he gives little
importance to the theory of reincarnation. He explains the meaning of rites
involving animal—and even human—sacrifice, without pronouncing any moral
judgment.
What is typical of Hinduism and evident from the view taken by Alain
Daniélou is its tolerance, its total lack of dogma, and the possibility for each
person to choose the way of life and religious practices best suited to one’s own
character. This is what Daniélou always did, making it impossible to classify or
label him as belonging to any precise, definite current. A careful examination of
his writings often shows apparent contradictions, which bothered him very little.
Indeed, unlike most Hindus, he found theories about reincarnation just as
questionable as those about paradise put forward by monotheists. He insisted on
his decision to be cremated, which is by no means an absolute practice among
the devotees of Shiva.
A realist, he considered that we are only the links in a chain, but that, if we
do not take on this role, the chain will be broken, the line will be wiped out. He
used to say, “We only continue in two ways: through our genetic code, meaning
by procreation, and by transmitting knowledge, that heritage of learning that we
can teach the generations that follow us.” He also said, “We continue to exist
only so long as someone continues to think of us.”
One personal conviction remains and seems increasingly clear to me: Alain
Daniélou, either as a natural gift or through contact with some extremely strong
esoteric circle, had himself acquired powers—foreknowledge, the lightning
glance, abilities that in some way made him a seer—but that, as a result of the
orthodox education he had received, it was important for him never to show nor
to use them except for wholly exceptional or serious reasons.
Did any other initiation take place, apart from the rite of his initiation into
Shaivism? It is impossible to say. Some things are clear, however, such as his
certainty of the extraordinary powers possessed by representatives of the esoteric
currents he had met, which drew his admiration, as well as a distrust, or even
fear, of the saddhus who so easily ensnare ignorant Westerners. He was also

clearly opposed to the religions of the city: monotheistic religions, as also certain
forms of Vaishnavism, which he found affected, sanctimonious, “plaster saint,”
just the opposite of hard, violent Shaivism, which is joyful and dissolute. The
god Shiva, whom he identified with Dionysus in the ancient West, is a god of
both life and death, the god of bacchanals and drunkenness, as well as of great
austerities. Many of his books—such as While the Gods Play: Shaiva Oracles
and Predictions on the Cycles of History and the Destiny of Mankind and Shiva
and Dionysus—quote from ancient texts to explain the origins of this very
ancient religion.
“Religions, taken as a whole, represent the most arbitrary and stupid
speculations that man ever invented,” Alain Daniélou told me, an argument he
took up again during one of his interviews.
Whoever knows his work, much of which deals with religions and in whose
titles the gods often appear, cannot but be astonished. Anyone who knew the
man and his taste for paradox would recognize him immediately.
The first book that Alain Daniélou published, in 1936, was a collection of
articles entitled Le Tour du monde en 1936.4 From that time up to 1993, in
addition to about twenty seminal works, Alain Daniélou wrote several hundred
articles and papers for journals, encyclopedias, conferences, radio programs, and
so on, some in French, others in English, Hindi, or Italian.
These texts deal with a very wide variety of subjects concerning India, such
as its religion, society, language, yoga, and music. Some have never been
published, and most are unobtainable. With his consent, and under his
supervision, I began cataloguing these texts according to subject matter, whence
the idea of publishing collections of these texts in book form.
Jean-Louis Gabin—who early on took an interest in this project and began
working on it while Daniélou was still alive—has undertaken the task of writing
the preface, as well as collecting and editing these various texts, which present a
previously unpublished viewpoint of Alain Daniélou’s work.
This volume particularly focuses on Alain Daniélou’s writings about
Shaivism, dealing with its primordial origins and its revival, its philosophy and
practices, and its relationship to Tantrism, Buddhism, and Western philosophical
explorations.

S
Shaivite Cosmology
and Polytheism
haivite philosophy knows no dogma. It does not separate theology and
cosmology, science and religion. Their common aim is to seek to
understand the nature of the world, and the role and destiny of living beings.
Seen from inside, the universe may be envisaged as a game, a fantasy born
in the mind of a transcendent Being. But the Being that conceives the world is
necessarily outside it: it is beyond the birth of space, time, and existence; it is
unknowable, imperceptible, inactive, nonexistent; it is beyond number, neither
one nor many. There is no way in which we can personify, imagine, or name this
Being, except negatively.
This Being is that which has existed since before the creation of space, the
receptacle that made it possible for the universe to be formed, followed by the
explosion of energy that gave rise to matter, to atoms and suns, and to the
measure of time.
MANIFESTATION
The first principle that appeared is space, called akasha, or ether, representing
the development potential of the universe. Then appeared the plan, the system
according to which the world develops. The laws of attraction and gravitation
that led to the formation of atoms and galaxies must necessarily have preceded
their formation, along with the principles of consciousness and perception. This
set of laws, forming a preexisting image of the world, is called Purusha, the
universal man.
Lastly, energy appeared, Shakti: the substance from which all the
components of the universe are formed, whatever can be designated as
“something” (tattva). This mass of energy from which everything is fashioned is
called pradhana (the base), or Prakriti (nature), but also maya (the power of

illusion), since all the world’s appearances are, in fact, merely more or less
unstable combinations of tensions, or vibrations of energy. Matter is only
apparent.
The Principle of Self
The first principle to come forth from Prakriti is the notion of individuality, of
“self.” Each atom, each cell, every living being, each solar system, takes shape
around a sort of individual consciousness. A living being is merely a
conglomerate of cells, each with its own individuality, its independent behavior,
grouping together as a complex system around an “ego,” something that says
“I,” which is, however, independent of its various component parts. It is the
same for every atom, for every solar system, all of which are built around a
consciousness of being, or individuality. A kind of consciousness is
consequently present in each atom, in each planetary system. The sun has
consciousness, just like every living being. This notion is critical, since the
notion of a god, a divine personage, is a projection of the notion of individuality,
of a being that says “I.” Monotheism is merely the deification of the notion of
individuality.
The Sixteen Tattvas
Then appeared the different components of which the universe is formed: the
sixteen tattvas, that which can be defined as “something.” They are the
principles of what appear to us as the five states of matter (tanmatra), the five
forms of perception to which they correspond, and the five related forms of
action, to which is added the principle of thought.
The five states of matter first manifest as magnetic potential, then in turn in
gaseous, igneous, liquid, and solid forms, while at the same time the five
corresponding forms of perception appear. In the human being the five forms of
perception are manifested in the five senses: hearing perceives vibration, touch
corresponds to the gaseous state, sight is the fiery state and light, taste
corresponds to the liquid state, and smell to the solid state. These forms of
perception are connected to the states of matter: gaseous particles communicate
by collision, by touch; the stars—which are fusion reactors—communicate with
each other by means of light; liquefied elements mix or separate by taste, and so
on.
Everywhere, in each atom, in each group of particles forming an entity, a

“self”—the principle of thought—is present, together with consciousness, since
Purusha, the plan, the universal intellect, pervades all aspects of Prakriti, or
nature.
When we seek to understand the nature of the world, its origin, its raison
d’être, following the stage we have now reached, we come across a more or less
abstract aspect of what we term the divine. At the level of the principles of the
five senses—the elements—we can envisage a god of the winds, Vayu, a god of
fire, Agni, a god of the waters, Varuna, and we represent the earth that nourishes
us as the Mother Goddess. The sun, the center of the world we live in, giver of
light and life, is for us the very image of godhead. It is equally possible to
envisage spirits that have no other substance than thought, like characters in a
dream. We can conceive of gods that correspond to the powers of action,
personifying strength, courage, justice, love, friendship, as well as destruction
and death.
SUBSTANCE AND ARCHETYPE
(PRAKRITI AND PURUSHA)
Underlying manifestation is the notion of Prakriti, the substance of the created
world, considered as a female aspect, and the notion of the archetypal plan,
which is Purusha, considered as a male principle. In Shaivism, this is the aspect
represented by the phallus cult, the male principle from which comes forth the
semen containing the genetic code, the plan of the living being, which manifests
itself in the substance, in the egg contained in the female organ.
Here, however, our approach comes to a halt, because beyond the couple
Purusha-Prakriti, or Shiva-Shakti, lies the barrier that separates the created from
the noncreated, the nonexistent, nonbeing, the unknowable. We can only
worship the world principle in its manifestation, its works. Whatever aspect of
the world we envisage, we see in a veiled form an aspect of the divine plan. The
divine work is, however, of an infinite variety. We can recognize the divine in
whatever aspect of its work we choose as its image, in whatever we like most.
Such an image may be a tree, an animal, a man, a woman, a bird, a stone, a
symbol, or an idea. This is why the gods are without number.
All paths lead toward the Creator but never reach that Being. The strength of
love, devotion, allows us to go a little farther each time, but our effort of
concentration needs a support, and it is this support that becomes for us the
image of the divine. We contemplate the face of the beloved knowing full well
that that face is not the person we love. Similarly, the divine appears to us in

multiple forms, in the guise of innumerable gods.
THE MONOTHEISTIC ERROR
Monotheism is therefore a metaphysical error, since the world principle, which
is outside the world, is beyond number, impersonal, indescribable, and
unknowable. Above all, monotheism is dangerous because of its consequences,
since it is a projection of the human “self” into the divine sphere, replacing love
and respect for the divine work as a whole with a fictitious character, a kind of
heavenly king who governs human affairs, to whom the most absurd edicts are
attributed. Intolerant, the so-called “only god” is, in fact, only the god of one
tribe. Monotheistic religions have served as an excuse for persecutions,
massacres, and genocides; they fight each other to impose the dominion of their
heavenly tyrant on others.
In actual fact, monotheism is merely a political fiction. It does not exist on
the religious level. We worship the Mother Goddess, the Earth Mother who
appears in caverns. We worship different symbols, prophets, heroes, saints, and
holy places. In our approach to the divine, it is not a matter of the image, the face
that we give it. We can very well say, “It is in Jesus that I see God. For me, he
represents that visible form in which I can best conceive the face of God.” But
when we say, “Baal is not god, let us destroy these idols,” or else “Apollo is not
god, God does not dwell in a sacred tree, the phallus is not the symbol of the
Creator,” we deny the presence of the divine in its manifested works. God is all.
God is everywhere, or God is nothing.
We confuse what the Hindus call ishta devata, “the chosen god”—that
aspect each of us chooses to worship as a representative of the divine—with the
cosmogonic reality of the Universal Being. Our devotion toward our chosen god
must not become a denial of other faces of the divine. We may well say, “For
me, the woman I love is my chosen wife.” But we cannot say to other men, “My
wife is the only woman. You must make love with her.” The error of
monotheism lies in similar reasoning, opposing a chosen god to the thousand
faces through which divine reality shines.
Who knows through what aspect of the world the experience of the divine
will one day be manifest to us? For many, it is in the act of love that the
lightning sensation of this reality suddenly appears. The union of bodies in the
act of love, a reflection of the union of cosmic principles, is perhaps the highest,
the most direct experience that we can have of beatitude, of the limitless joy that
is the nature of the divine state.

S
The Shaivite Revival from the
Third to the Tenth Centuries C.E.
ince prehistoric times, India has known two great religious traditions. The
first, Shaivism, is a nature religion, which seeks to perceive the divine in its
works and to become part of them. The second is Jainism, a humanistic
religion, dealing essentially with ethical and social values. Aryan Vedism
gradually incorporated the concepts of these two ancient traditions, at many
contradictory levels, resulting in what is now known as Hinduism, whereas
Shaivism and Jainism as such have continued down to our own times in parallel
with Hinduized Vedism.
From Shaivism comes the cosmological research known as Samkhya, as well
as Yoga, the study of the human being’s latent powers. From Jainism comes the
theory of karma and transmigration, which seeks to explain human inequalities
as being due to moral lapses committed in previous lives, and justifies the social
hierarchy on this basis. Buddhism and later Vaishnavism are adaptations of
Jainism within the general framework of Hinduism. The Jain theory of
transmigration has been used to justify contempt for the untouchables, making
their past lapses responsible for their present condition. Buddhism carried this
notion with it as far as Japan. Shaivism has never accepted the idea of the
inequality of birth, even though it recognizes hierarchies at genetic, professional,
and social levels.
In India, the period stretching from the third to the tenth century C.E. was a
period of crisis from the point of view of philosophic and religious thought.
Buddhism had seriously shaken the foundations of Aryan Vedism, which had
dominated India for centuries. Buddhism was, in its turn, contested not only by
Vedism, but—more especially—by a return to the autochthonous religions.
There was an extraordinary revival of a very ancient philosophic and religious
heritage, coming from the prestigious pre-Aryan civilization, and in particular
from Shaivism, from the cult of the goddess and the ecstatic and mystical rites of
Tantrism.

During the course of history, the originally rather primitive religion of the
Aryan nomads had assimilated many elements of the thought, rites, and cults of
the great civilizations that had preceded it in India. However, it remained
centered—at least nominally—on the texts derived from the Vedas. At the same
time, these texts had gradually been reinterpreted and commented on according
to the data of a much more developed philosophy, mythology, and cosmology.
The pre-Aryan civilization, which in proto-historical times had extended its
influence as far as Western Europe, had not been annihilated by the invaders and
had to a great extent continued to exist parallel to Vedism. The ancient concepts
of Shaivism, Tantrism, Shaktism, and Yoga, together with the ancient Samkhya
cosmology, lay beneath the surface and continued to reappear at every level and
in every period. Owing to a historical aberration, there has been a tendency to
present their reappearances as new developments, except when they have been
envisaged solely in relation to Vedic civilization. Whether from the Atharva
Veda, the Upanishads, or the traditional sciences, Brahmanism has constantly
taken its inspiration from pre-Aryan culture, which little by little it assimilated.
The Mahabharata (XII, 349, 63, et seq.), referring to the leading religious
and philosophical systems, mentions—on the same level—the Samkhya, the
Yoga, the Pancharatra, the Veda, and the Pashupata, that is, Shaivism,
Vaishnavism, and Vedism.
Throughout history, ancient Shaivism indeed remained as the religion of
most of India’s population, particularly in the south (which had preserved its
original language), but also in the east, in Kalinga, Bengal, in central India, and
in the Himalayan regions. Although the Aryans had installed missionary
brahman families in these outlying provinces, they had never been really
assimilated. They played a role of political as much as religious infiltration,
rather like the role of European missionaries in the countries of Africa or Asia
nowadays. Shaivite and Tantric rites, needing no brahmanic priesthood,
continued alongside the Vedic rites, just as they still do today.
During the early centuries of our era, ancient Brahmanism—contested by
Buddhism—lost its intransigence and adopted ideas of nonviolence,
vegetarianism, and transmigration from Jain infiltration. Buddhism and Vedism
both assimilated the practices of Yoga and Tantrism and adopted the Shaivite
deities.
SCYTHIANS AND PARTHIANS
Between the first and third centuries C.E., the north of India experienced an

extremely cosmopolitan period. Invaders from the north had established empires
stretching from central Asia to the Punjab, Sindh, Gujerat, and as far as the
Mahratta country and central India. The dynasties of the Pahlavas (who were
Parthians) and the Shakas (who were Scythians) lasted until the end of the fourth
century. The Yeh Chis, or Kushanas, who drove back the Parthians, came from
central Asia, which always remained their true homeland. These newcomers did
not belong to the ancient Aryan clans from which the brahmans claimed their
descent. Since Vedism could thus offer them only a subaltern position, they were
little inclined to accept it. They adopted either Buddhism or Shaivism and were
sometimes even interested in Jainism.
Highly international, the Kushanas maintained cultural and trade relations
with the Roman Empire, Persia, and China. Kanishka, the Kushan emperor who
reigned from 120 to 162 C.E., officially adopted Buddhism, the propagation of
which served as a pretext for his conquests, although his attitude toward other
religions remained very liberal. Kanishka’s coins show Greek, Zoroastrian,
Mithraic, Buddhist, and even Shaivite deities (the last mentioned being mainly
Shiva and Durga). The Vedic deities had already been put aside. Kanishka’s
reign also saw—two centuries after the disappearance of the last Greek kingdom
in Gandhara—the development of what is known as Greco-Buddhist art, but
which is actually Indo-Scythian.
Kanishka undertook a reform of Buddhism to make it more eclectic and
better suited to his political designs. He summoned a great council, during which
the philosopher Ashvagosha, a Hindu converted to Buddhism, defined the
canons of what is known as the Mahayana, or Great Vehicle. This work has a
high philosophical content and is a kind of synthesis, integrating into Buddhism
Shaivite and Tantric elements, as well as notions borrowed from the Greeks,
Christians, Zoroastrians, and from the cults of central Asia. Having become the
state religion, Buddhism set about absorbing—without too many upsets—the
various religious tendencies of the empire.
This enterprise—which was highly effective from the point of view of
India’s cultural expansion in central Asia, Tibet, and the Far East—did not,
however, succeed in India itself. The third century saw the birth, in southern,
central, and northern India, of a revival of pre-Aryan culture, and of Shaivism in
particular. This movement started in central India among a group of
confederated tribes, whose chiefs were called the Barashivas. This was a
reaction against foreign cults and modern religions like Buddhism but was also
against Vedism. The movement was both religious and political, the revenge of a
civilization oppressed for centuries by invaders who had long ridiculed it, at the
same time borrowing the elements needed for their own development. The

success of this revenge is a phenomenon that is almost unique in history. The
Romans also took their inspiration from the thought and art of conquered
Greece, but Greece itself never rose again.
The decadence of Vedism, followed by the discomfort of Buddhism, allowed
the other non-Aryan sects to lift their heads and officially claim the position that
had secretly always been theirs. Besides Shaivism, Jainism—that moralistic and
atheistic religion representing an ancient autochthonous tradition—also regained
a popularity that was previously challenged by Buddhism. Neither should we
forget the influence that Jainism played in India and elsewhere. Jain missionaries
had played an anything but negligible role in the development of Greek
philosophy. The philosopher that Alexander wanted to take back with him from
India, but who committed suicide shortly before the death of the conqueror,
himself was a Jain. Buddhism had been a reform of Vedism mainly inspired by
Jainism. In Hinduizing itself and integrating Tantric rites, Mahayana Buddhism
lost its raison d’être in India, although puritanical Hinayana Buddhism offered
an alternative to Jainism.
The new religion that arose, sometimes known as neo-Brahmanism or
Hinduism, was not—like its predecessor—Vedism influenced by Shaivism but
was henceforth Shaivism vaguely suggestive of Vedism, just as Mahayana
Buddhism became Shaivism disguised as Buddhism. The texts and rites of
Shaivism and Tantrism became the real basis of Hinduism.
Thus, after a long eclipse, ancient Shaivism—with its cosmology, Samkhya,
its conception of the human being defined by Yoga, and its rites expounded in its
sacred texts, the Agamas (traditions) and Tantras (rules)—once more took a
dominant position, covered by vague references to the primacy of the Vedas.
The term “Veda,” however, was henceforth no longer understood as a “book
constituting a revelation” (like the Bible and the Koran), but as meaning dharma,
the universal law governing the world, whose various revelations are merely
fragmentary insights owed to the intuition of inspired sages, the rishis, or seers.
The Vedic texts were no longer considered as revelation, but as a relative
expression—among others—of the perpetual human search into the secrets of
the natural world and the divine.
THE GUPTAS
In 319, a Jat, a Scythe from Rajputana, assassinated Sundara Varman, the last
king of an obscure dynasty that had succeeded the Kushanas and reigned at
Pataliputra—present day Patna—in the northeast of India. This Jat took power

under the name of Chandragupta, founding a powerful dynasty that was to
dominate northern India for three centuries. This period, which was one of the
most brilliant in Indian civilization, is sometimes called the “Golden Age of the
Guptas.” A period of peace and culture, it witnessed an astonishing artistic
bloom, along with the production of many religious and philosophical texts that
strove, with varying degrees of success, to renew the link with the most ancient
traditions. This period is very much like what was later to be the Renaissance in
Europe, as it was first conceived, the Renaissance of Prospero Colonna, Alberti,
Pico della Mirandola, of the “Dream of Polyphilus.”
Chandragupta’s successor, Samudragupta, who reigned from 330 to 380, was
a pious Hindu, who actively undertook to eliminate the foreign religions
introduced by the Shakas and Kushanas. The ancient Shaivite culture, denigrated
both by Aryan Brahmanism and by Buddhism, once more became predominant.
Southern India, Bengal, and Kashmir, considered as the outer corridors of the
sacred territory of India, had largely preserved the pre-Aryan cultural tradition
that could now reaffirm itself. On the other side, the arrival of the Huns, who
occupied the Punjab (toward 500), then the Turks, who closed the northern
frontiers, isolated the Indian world almost entirely from its international
contacts, particularly its close ties with central Asia and China. Only sea trade
with Egypt, Persia, and Europe remained relatively active.
Chandragupta II, known as Vikramaditya, who succeeded Samudragupta,
transferred his capital westward, to Ujjain. There, he gathered the greatest artists
of his time, writers such as the celebrated poet Kalidasa, scholars like the
astronomer Vaharamihira and the Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu, and so on.
Astronomy, medicine, and both sacred and secular architecture once more saw
great developments.
TEXTS
This period saw the reappearance of a great number of non-Vedic texts, which
had been secretly handed down through the centuries. Along with the sacred
texts of Shaivism, the Agamas, and the Tantras, these texts also included
Shaivism’s historical books, the Puranas, whose roots—notwithstanding
innumerable interpolations and recastings—go back to the dawn of prehistory.
To these should be added the Mahabharata, that vast encyclopedia of
knowledge. Some Agamas belong to different cults, which may or may not be
connected to Shaivism. The Mahabharata commentary tells us that the Agamas
are the sacred books of: the Sauras, the sun-worshippers; the Shaktas, who

worship the goddesses; the Ganeshas, who practice the cult of spirits; and the
Shaivas and Vaishnavas. The Vaishnavas consider the sacred texts of the
Vaishnavite Pancharatra superior to the Vedas. These comprise some 100,000
verses, which have been adapted to conform in appearance with the Vedas.
Most of these texts are of extremely ancient origin. Echoes of them can be
found in the Atharva Veda, in the Upanishads, the works of grammarians, and
scientific treatises. How and in what languages they were handed down through
the centuries is still a mystery. The Tamil versions of some texts are more
ancient than the Sanskrit versions. Indeed, during the long period of Aryan
domination, both texts and rites were handed down using the same method in use
nowadays. Side by side with the bookish, exoteric tradition, kept alive by priests
to ensure the continuation of the rites and teachings, the highest forms of
knowledge are transmitted by the sannyasis, members of the monastic orders,
whose initiation is essentially Shaivite and secret. They are outside the caste
system and are hierarchically higher than the brahmans.
In such forms of teaching, the essentials of the doctrines are condensed into
versified formulae, called sutras (threads), which can be memorized and handed
down from master to disciple for generations, without leaving any visible trace.
Such texts are even—sometimes—transmitted by persons who do not understand
their meaning, merely acting as a kind of living book. At the time of the Shaivite
revival, the heirs of this most ancient culture were obliged to produce their
doctrines in book form in order to oppose those of Vedism and Buddhism. The
Agamas, Puranas, and Tantras had to be transcribed in a form that was
accessible to all. This is why many of these texts were drawn up in or translated
into Sanskrit, which had become the universal cultural language. This at the
same time discredited the Prakrit, the popular language utilized by the
Buddhists.
It is impossible to understand Hinduism, or even the development of
Vedism, without making any reference to that vast literature, which is—in actual
fact—the basis of the philosophic conceptions, beliefs, and sciences of the
Hindus. Often translated badly into Sanskrit at the time of the Shaivite revival,
these texts have not received the attention they deserve. The fact that they have
not survived in their original language or form has misled several modern
researchers to believe that they were drawn up at the time of their new Sanskrit
edition, whereas on the whole they obviously belong to remote antiquity.
By way of example, the fact that the name of Chandragupta had been added
to the dynasties of the Vayu Purana led to the belief that this Purana as a whole
had been written at that time. However, the Puranas are, by definition, historical
texts, so it was quite normal to update them by presenting current events in the

form of predictions. In fact, the astronomical references contained in the
Puranas have made it possible to establish the extraordinary antiquity of some of
the legendary accounts, taking into consideration that, at the spring equinox, the
sun rose in the constellation of Orion in 4000 b.C.E., in the constellation of
Taurus in 3000 b.C.E., and in the constellation of the Pleiades in the year 2000
before our era.1
THE DARSHANAS: PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS
The philosophic concepts inherited from Shaivite tradition that were revived
from the third to the tenth centuries were expounded principally in what
traditional scholars know as the ancient Samkhya, the cosmological theory that
studies the nature of the material and subtle world, seeking common principles
behind the various aspects of existence, matter, life, thought, the archetypes of
creation. To Samkhya, we must add Yoga, the study of the nature of the physical
and spiritual human being, and Vyakarana, the study of language, instrument of
knowledge and communication, whose limitations determine the possibilities of
human understanding.
The theory of the six darshanas, or “points of view,” on the basis of which
any question can be approached, establishes a perfect balance between the
different trends of philosophical, religious, and scientific thought:
The Samkhya, or cosmology, studies the process by which the universe
develops, according to archetypes of an essentially mathematical nature.
The word samkhya means “measurable” or “numerable.”
Yoga deals with human nature and the relationships between the physical,
sensorial, intellectual, and spiritual aspects of the human being.
The Vaisheshika, or scientific method, studies the laws of the visible world.
Nyaya, or logic, deals with methods of reasoning and the means of proof.
The Purva Mimamsa studies rites and means of contact between the natural
and supernatural worlds.
The Uttara Mimamsa, or metaphysics, deals with the nature of the divine and
human spiritual destiny.
From the often-conflicting conclusions of their investigations, these
approaches highlight the relative value of all knowledge and constitute a
sure barrier against any kind of dogmatism.
Samkhya, Vaisheshika, and Nyaya, not being deistic, were taught side-by-

side with Buddhist philosophy at the famous university of Nalanda. Toward the
middle of the ninth century, Vachaspati Mishra published his great commentary
on the darshanas, giving them the definitive form they have now. However, the
Samkhya summarized by Vachaspati Mishra is merely one aspect of the ancient
Samkhya. The main texts, such as the Shashti Tantra, are no longer accessible.
The sole surviving texts are the Samkhya Sutras (attributed to the non-Aryan
sage Kapila), the Tattva Samasa, and the Samkhya Karika by Ishvarakrishna
(second century), this last work most probably being a summary used for
teaching purposes. The initiatic and philosophic tradition handed down by the
sannyasis, however, frequently refers to texts that have apparently been lost. It is
difficult to know whether the original texts still exist outside oral tradition.
According to Samkhya theory, the universe developed from a nucleus, a
genetic code whose characteristics are found in the structure of both atoms and
solar systems, as well as in the principles of life, thought, perception, and
communication. A sense of perception corresponds to each state of matter, and
each has its own language, which enables us to conceive and convey an
approximate expression of sensations and thought processes.
Thus, there is a language of smells (related to the solid element), a language
of taste (related to the water element), a visual language of gesture (related to the
fiery element), and a language of sound, articulated or musical (related to the
spatial element or ether). The characteristics of these various languages are
adapted to the multiple aspects of creation, to different life forms. The
limitations of our perceptions determine our vision of the world. As with words,
our sense organs are both obstacles and tools of knowledge.
The limits of language potentials form barriers to the development and
transmission of knowledge. As certain modern linguists have remarked, one of
the problems of contemporary science is to exceed the limitations posed by the
concepts of Aryan languages. Sanskrit, however, has assimilated many notions
that lie beyond the mental horizon set by Aryan languages, which explains why
many Sanskrit words and concepts are so difficult to analyze and translate.
Samkhya teaches that any method of investigation must first establish the
limits beyond which its conclusions are no longer valid. We find an echo of
Samkhya conceptions at all stages of thought and philosophy in India, but as
often as not, it is in scientific works that the cosmological theory is most clearly
propounded.
The very ancient theory of language presented by Nandikeshvara in his
Kashika and Rudra Damaru Sutra Vivarana explains language potentials and
limitations as summarized in the hermetic formulas of the Maheshvara Sutra.
This theory was to be developed in the fifth century by Bhartrihari in his Vakya

Padiya, a work that has no equivalent in any other civilization, although the
theory of the Creator-Word that derives from it is often mentioned, particularly
in the Hellenistic and Christian world, but as a vague abstraction.
Applications of Samkhya concepts are found in rites, in sciences, in
mythology, and in the systems of philosophy. However when such notions are
isolated from the theory and its critical apparatus, which are only found in the
commentaries connected with esoteric transmission, they sometimes give rise to
aberrant interpretations and lucubration.
Samkhya has even been deemed atheistic, since it considers that the prime
cause of the universe is nonspatial, and thus nonlocatable, impersonal, and
unknowable. Yet the representation of the energy principles manifested in the
different aspects of creation in the form of more or less anthropomorphic deities
is part of a system used for teaching the masses and making accessible notions
that are beyond their comprehension. Humans need gods, need an animistic
concept that involves entities acting behind the subtle forces that rule the world.
Thus, centrifugal force, the force of dispersion that gives birth to the universe, is
symbolically represented by the god Shiva, the creator and destroyer principle.
Centripetal force, bringing about concentration, coagulation, and the formation
of material entities, is Vishnu, the protector principle. The resultant orbital force
that presides over the formation of worlds, solar systems, and atoms is the god
Brahma, the maker, or artisan. Similarly, deities also govern the states of matter:
Agni, the god of fire, Vayu, god of the air and winds, Varuna, god of waters,
without forgetting the earth goddess.
SHAIVISM AND VEDANTA IN SOUTH INDIA
The Barashivas and the Guptas opened the door to the Shaivite revival,
particularly at a religious level. Later on, its great intellectual expansion was the
result of the powerful Dravidian dynasties that took power in the south of India,
where pre-Aryan culture had been maintained. The principal dynasties were the
Pallavas of Kanchi, the Cholas of Tanjore, and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta.
The Rashtrakuta empire, between 700 and 1000 C.E., stretched from the extreme
south of the subcontinent to the Ganges valley in the north. It was in this period
that the famous temples of Elephanta and Ellora were built.
Shankaracharya
At this period, we find many important men of letters coming from the south of

India, who were of Dravidian language and training, but used Sanskrit as a
means of expression. This was not without an impact on the development of
philosophic thought, since the basic concepts expressed by the potential of the
Dravidian languages are very different from those of the Aryan languages. The
most important of these Dravidian scholars was—at the outset of the ninth
century—Shankaracharya, the famous commentator of the Brahma Sutras and
the Upanishads, founder of the exclusive nondualist school, the Kevaladvaita.
After him came Bhaskara, the inventor of the theory of “separation in unity”
(bhedabheda), which was later taken over by the Muslim Sufis. Next came
Madhvan dualism, which is Vaishnavite, and absolute nondualism, the
Shuddhadvaita of Vallabha. It was during the same period that Vachaspati
Mishra’s commentary on the Yoga Sutras by Patanjali appeared.
At a philosophical level, Shankaracharya can be considered as the person
who definitively annexed Vedism to Shaivism, utilizing a subtle and often
perverse dialectic, as well as terminological artifices to carry the notions of one
system into the other.
Born in Kerala, in southern India, Shankaracharya was initiated as a sannyasi
when he was very young, without having first passed through the obligatory
stage of marriage. A man of any caste can become a sannyasi. He then changes
his name and his origins must be kept secret. It was later claimed that Shankara
was the posthumous son of a brahman, and had been raised by his widow. He
was the disciple of a certain Govinda, himself the disciple of Gaudapada who, in
the seventh century, had commented on the Samkhya Karika and had also
written a commentary on the Mandukya Upanishad.
In his masterly commentaries on the Brahma Sutras, on some of the
Upanishads, and on the Bhagavad Gita, Shankara strove to provide a synthesis
of the ideas of the Shaivite Samkhya, Jainism, Buddhism, and elements from the
various Darshanas. That hard and systematic brain whose mother tongue was
Dravidian developed an extremely logical philosophical doctrine in an
irreproachable, scholarly Sanskrit. Under the name of Vedanta, this doctrine was
to pass for a synthesis of Hinduism, whereas the very principle of the Darshanas
was to seek different approaches and combat any kind of simplification or
synthesis.
The ancient Samkhya—which, as we have seen, is a prudent search for a
certain number of fundamental realities known as tattvas, or “basic elements”—
is much less dogmatic than the Vedanta—which, in seeking to synthesize,
destroyed a complex system of investigations into the nature of the world and
the divine that had made it possible to coordinate scientific research and
metaphysical speculation without confusing them.

Indeed, Shankara is one of the first inventors of what in modern terms is
known as an ideology, that is, a logical system with scientific claims, developed
using skillful dialectic, but with assumptions that do not necessarily correspond
to reality, inevitably leading to unhappy experiences. Not without reason,
Madhva defined Shankara as “a deceitful demon who has falsified the teachings
of the Brahma Sutras to lead souls astray.” Shankara’s work, however, remains
important for his skillful demoralization of the religious hegemonies set up by
Vedism and Buddhism. Thus we might speculate on the deeper motives of this
great philosopher.
The Evolution of Vedanta
Starting from the seventh century, there was a revival in the activities of the
ancient churches of Kerala, a region that also contained a Jewish community
who, deported by the Phoenicians, had settled there beginning in 555 b.C.E. Born
in Kerala, Shankara could not have been ignorant of the existence of these
Jewish and Christian communities. At the same time, the widening influence of
Islam was giving rise to serious intellectual and religious problems. The Arabs
had occupied Kabul in 650, and the Sindh a little later on. The conception of
monotheism, along with its aggressiveness and the audacity with which such a
simplistic doctrine could be presented as progress, impressed the philosophers,
who sought to adapt it, interpret it, and incorporate it. It was a phenomenon like
Marxism, which clandestinely penetrated all religious thought, no one daring to
point out the countertruths and the unrealistic nature of its assumptions.
The prestige of the metaphysical absurdity that monotheism represented for
traditional doctrine was to affect philosophic thought in India down to our own
times. The Western world was hardly interested in anything but philosophies
infected by this germ. In vain, the Tantras continued to proclaim
“ekashabdatmika maya: the number ‘one’is the soul of error.” For the Samkhya,
the number “one” is collective, referring to a group or fragment, and does not
exist as an absolute, since nothing exists except in relation to something else.
The wise and prudent cosmology of the Samkhya—which, starting from the
sentiment of the omnipresence of the supernatural derived from animistic
concepts, goes back through the subtle energies, personalized by the major
Shaivite, Vedic, and Buddhist gods, to arrive at a nonspatial, impersonal, and
unknowable prime cause—found itself faced with the simplistic theory of a
personal artisan-god who made the world, governs it arbitrarily, and dictates
rules of conduct directly to humanity.

The most primary ideas are the ones that most easily disarm philosophers.
They search for ambiguous explanations to tackle them and incorporate them in
one way or another in traditional philosophy. The problems raised in India by
confrontation with Islamic and Christian monotheism certainly played a role in
the importance given to nondualist or more-or-less monist speculations.
Identifying Atman with Brahman, that is, identifying the center of the human
being with the prime, nonmanifested cause of the universe, beyond space and
time, does in fact imply a personification, a spatial localization of Brahman, and
justifies the eventual divinization of incarnations. Identifying the soul, conceived
as the center of the living being, with a nonmanifested Absolute is, however, a
contradiction of terms. Brahman, envisaged by the Samkhya as the prime cause,
neutral, impersonal, and unknowable, in actual fact becomes, without it being
admitted, an only god, easily personified, close to the Christian and Muslim
concept.
Under the name of Vedanta, the Uttara Mimamsa, thus tastefully brought up
to date, was to become of great importance, almost leading to the elimination of
the other Darshanas. Having lost its own critical apparatus, the Vedanta was to
become purely speculative. Its apparent rationalism would attract thinkers in the
Christian and Islamic world, with the result that it obtained a sort of exclusivity
as representing philosophic thought in India.
Curiously enough, of India—the home of logic and the exact sciences—the
modern West was to retain particularly its abstruse speculations and irrational
religiosity, thus neglecting a whole body of scientific and philosophic
knowledge, which they preferred to attribute to themselves.
In our own time, in India as in the West, the emphasis laid on the
Westernized Vedanta to the detriment of much more concrete forms of thought
makes the modern approach incomprehensible to traditional Hindu scholars,
used to the rigorous disciplines of the Darshanas and to the scientific and
cosmological concepts of the Vaisheshika and Samkhya. I had the chance to
ascertain this fact when, as advisor to the traditionalist Hindu party,a I was often
questioned about the importance that Westerners attributed to the philosophy of
Aurobindo and to the theories of Gandhi, which to them seemed unbelievably
elementary and puerile.
Anchored to its notion of progress, the modern world tries to see as a new
development what is often merely a distortion or decadence of thought, or
merely a reference to an unexplained system. The lucubration and disputes
between monism, nondualism, qualified nondualism, dualism, and so on are the
result of the problems raised by Christian and Islamic monotheism, which Hindu
philosophy had to tackle.

Westernized Vedanta has become the basis of that syncretism sought by
modern thinkers, like Ramakrishna, Aurobindo, and Gandhi. In actual fact, it
represents the elimination of the scientific and logical spirit of the Samkhya that,
corrected by the other Darshanas, accepts any hypothesis as necessarily relative,
and finds in the very contradiction of the conclusions a critical method that
avoids any commitment to blind belief, arising out of illusory simplification.
THE REVIVAL’S IMPACT ON THE WEST AND FAR EAST
From the point of view of philosophical and religious thought, the arts and
sciences, from the third to the twelfth centuries, India was the unrivalled center
of civilization and humanism. It could not have failed to have an impact on other
world cultures. Probably Indian architects, driven from present-day Afghanistan
by the Islamic invasions, took part in the rise of the West’s cathedrals, just as
they did in the building of Islamic monuments. We shall never fully understand
the Middle Ages in the West if we do not take into account the influence—
despite the distance and obstacles—that Indian culture, then at its height, must
have exercised over medieval Europe.
The intellectual effervescence that made India the center of religious and
philosophic thought between the third and tenth centuries only concerned the
rather limited world of scholars. It involved discussions of ideas, philosophical
jousts in a refined society, rather than profound religious movements. Somewhat
like in the Greece of the classical period, a number of schools developed and
fought each other. Some have left little trace.
Modern Orientalists have shown little interest in the scientific aspects of the
knowledge of those periods, even though atomic theory, the theory of the
relativity of space and time, mathematical theories, astronomical and geographic
attainments, the theory of gravity, were all much in advance of anything the
Western world could then offer.
For example, in the middle of the fifth century, the astronomer and
geographer Aryabhata gives us a description of the terrestrial world, including
the vast Antarctic continent (whose inhabitants’heads are upside-down as
compared to those of the North Pole, but they are unaware of the fact), indicating
the precise time difference between New Guinea, Ceylon, and a city on the
American continent, apparently in Guatemala or Mexico, called Siddhapura, the
City of the Perfect.
Cultural exchanges between India and the Chinese world have always been
very important but are little known, since they were at the level of the Samkhya,

the sciences and Tantrism, never at the level of Vedism. From an Indian point of
view, such exchanges are mentioned starting from a very ancient period,
especially as concerns magical and Tantric rites. Often, the Tantras recommend
using the “Chinese rite” or chinachara for certain practices. We know little of
the influence of Jainism in China, although it is highly probable. Mahayana
Buddhism added a new dimension to these exchanges. The first Buddhist
missionaries reached China in 160 C.E. Tibet adopted Mahayana Buddhism.
Henceforth, Buddhist missionaries ensured constant contacts between the
civilizations of India and China. Chinese travelers visited India at various times.
Fa Hsien stayed at the court of Vikramaditya Gupta from 399 to 414, where he
probably met the poet Kalidasa. Hiuen Tsang stayed at the court of Harsha from
629 to 645 and has left an important account of his journey.
During the Shaivite revival, the Samkhya once more attracted the attention of
Chinese thinkers. Gaudapada’s commentary on the Samkhya Karika by
Ishvarakrishna was translated into Chinese in the sixth century. Texts on the
atomic theory of the Vaisheshika were translated in 648, as were Kanada’s
Sutras.
THE RELIGIOUS REALITY
Apart from the philosophers’speculations, which only concerned a small group
of intellectuals, what was the actual religion in India during this time? There was
an amazing mosaic of rites and beliefs, whose unity lay in diversity. India was,
and still is, a tolerant country. Neither the political imposition of Buddhism nor
the missionary fanaticism of Muslims, Christians, and—later on—Marxists were
able to seriously undermine this diversity.
The tribes remained animist, propitiating the spirits, the bhutas, which
animate the natural world, living in trees and peopling ponds and rivers. The
language of these tribes, continuing down to our own times in the Munda
dialects, is a survival of the most ancient layer of prehistoric civilization on the
Indian subcontinent, related to the Australians and the Pygmies in Africa.
Besides the tribes, as a whole, the people of Dravidian or Aryanized
languages remained Shaivite and practiced Tantric and magical rites and
sacrifices. Yoga remained the method of development and progress of the human
being. The cosmology of the Samkhya was the basis of scientific and
philosophic concepts.
Buddhism, gradually assimilated by Shaivism, was eliminated little by little,
except in Ceylon and Nepal. Vedism, respected but profoundly transformed,

continued as the basis of the official rites handed down by the brahmans, but its
gods no longer had any place in popular religion. The cult of deified pre-Aryan
heroes, mainly Krishna and Rama—declared to be incarnations of Vishnu—
replaced the ancient gods worshipped by the people.
Only Jainism, that other great pre-Aryan religion, maintained its integrity, its
basic atheism, its theories of nonviolence and reincarnation, its vegetarianism,
and strict moralism.
The Sects
Starting from the fourth century, a great number of Shaivite, Vaishnavite,
animist, or atheist sects reappeared in the light of day, having been freed from
ostracism and the clandestine existence to which they had been relegated by the
Vedic, then Buddhist, state religions. Each had its own sacred books, its
Agamas, presenting a body of religious and philosophical concepts of
astonishing richness and variety. Some of these sects have survived, while others
have now disappeared. The same is true of their books, destroyed or eaten by
bookworms in little-known and badlykept libraries for over a thousand years,
ever since the Muslim and later European invasions struck a serious blow at the
cultural organization and freedom of thought of the Hindu world. Essential
principles are, however, preserved by oral tradition.
Among the most important sects active between the second and tenth
centuries, we should mention the Sauras, the sun-worshippers, who deemed that
the earth and other planets come from that star and that there is nothing on the
terrestrial world that does not exist in the sun. The sun is thus the principle, the
origin of matter, as well as of life, thought, and consciousness. The solar system
is a living, thinking, conscious cell.
The Saumias, on the other hand, worshipped soma, the sacred liquor of the
Vedas. The moon is a cup of soma, which nourishes the gods. Soma, the essence
of life and elixir of immortality, is also represented by human seed, the source of
life.
The Ganapatyas worship the ganas, the boisterous and delinquent juvenile
spirits who are Shiva’s companions, as well as Ganapati, the elephant-headed
god who is their chief. Nothing must be attempted without ensuring the
benevolence of the ganas. This is why, down to our own times, Ganapati’s image
is placed above the house door.
The Pashupatas form one of the major Shaivite sects. Their doctrine is
known as Shaiva Siddhanta and is attributed to Lakulisha, who is deemed to be

an incarnation of Shiva-Pashupati, the lord of the animals. The word pashu,
animal, also includes the human animal. This doctrine envisages three principles:
pati, the master, pashu, the herd, and pasha, the snare, that is, the bond of natural
forces and laws by which the master keeps the herd in his power. This sect
practices violent rituals, sacrifices mixed with screams, laughter, and dances,
that are very close to the Dionysian rites.
By contrast, within the Vira Shaiva sect there developed a kind of abstract
and moralistic vegetarian Shaivism, influenced by Jainism. It has many
followers in southern India. We should also mention the important revival of the
cult of Skanda, Shiva’s son, identified with Murugan, the young prehistoric god
of the Dravidians, whose legends are identical to those of Cretan Dionysus.
The prehistoric cult of the goddesses also reappeared forcefully and is still
the popular religion of Bengal today. The ancient cult of the nagas (snakes)—
who are considered to be the race that preceded humankind and now live in a
subterranean world—must also have played a very important role if we go by the
number of naga images in temples of the Gupta period and even later on, in what
is called the medieval period.
At the same time, materialistic and atheistic movements reappeared, such as
the Nastikas (without god) and the Lokayatas (materialists), one of whose
champions was the famous Charvaka, who considered thought to be a
fermentation of matter, and denied the existence of the supernatural and the
survival of the soul.
At the same time, toward the fifth century, western India, though still under
Scythian dominion, saw the renaissance of a form of Vedism that was very strict
at a social level—particularly as far as the castes were concerned—while quite
liberal on the religious level. This revival, together with the rise of Shaivism,
ultimately led to the final defeat of Buddhism in India. Indeed, assimilated
Scythes, such as the Rajputs and the Mahrattas, have always felt close to the
original Aryans. They have played a major role in reasserting Vedism down to
our own times, although the authenticity of their Aryanism has been—and still is
—contested by the other brahman dynasties. This is one of the arguments that
have recently been used to criticize, from the Hindu point of view, the Arctic
Home of the Vedas, the great work by Tilak, who was a Mahratta.
Bhakti
One important development was that of the devotional and ecstatic cults with
regard to what is known as bhakti. The Bhagavatas or Pancharatras (devotees

and scriptures dedicated to Vishnu) worshipped the pre-Aryan heroes and in
particular Rama and Krishna, considered thenceforth as incarnations of Vishnu.
Vishnu is the male equivalent of the principle that the Shaivites call Shakti, the
goddess. There is thus an affinity between Shaktas and Bhagavatas. From this
tradition comes the notion of bhakti, devotion, total surrender of the self,
considered as the most effective means of approaching the divine.
The fundamentally anti-intellectual cult of Bhakti spread rapidly during the
Muslim period, giving rise to the flowering of devotional poetry, both in Sanskrit
and in the popular languages. The Alvars, the Vaishnavite saints of the south,
had already produced a vast mystical literature in Tamil, which came to exercise
a great influence on Indochina and Indonesia. At the same time, the Nayannars,
other Tamil saints who were Shaivite, transposed this mystical tradition into
Shaivite terms. Their songs were spread by wandering devotees. In the north,
Chaitanya, Kabir, Mirabai, Surdas, and others are famous examples. Those
orangerobed scatterbrains now rampant on the streets of New York, Paris, and
Berlin belong to this tradition.
Bhakti, that sentimental religious feeling toward an ill-defined and
humanized deity, ignored all metaphysical problems and made great strides in
the periods of disarray that followed the Islamic invasion. It has evident
equivalents in the Christian world. Parallel to a simplified Vedanta, Bhakti,
Krishnaism, and fanatical deistic sects developed, which have purveyed a
strangely distorted image of Hindu philosophy and religious and metaphysical
thought.
At a devotional level, Shia Islam and Hindu Bhakti are akin in confusing the
neutral, abstract creator principle with a personal god. Close relations were
established between Indian and Persian mystics. The doctrine of “separation in
unity” (bhedabheda vada), defined by Bhaskara in the eighth century, was taken
up by the Muslim Sufis. The ecstatic practices of both Bhaktas and Sufis are
identical, just like the mystic exaltation of the qataris, the wandering Muslim
poets, and the Hindu kajari singers. These pious nomadic musicians still today
sing both qatari and kajari poems, particularly those of Kabir.
CONCLUSION
It was this highly diversified world, with total freedom of thought and belief,
that saw the development—from the third to tenth centuries C.E.—of one of the
most astonishing periods of art, philosophy, and religious life in India, one of the
most remarkable moments in the history of humankind, up to the day when the

Muslim hordes destroyed its temples and broke its growth. It took a whole series
of Islamic invasions, with the ferocious destruction that accompanied them, to
paralyze a civilization that was the most developed in the world for its thought,
science, and arts, and amazed both Western and Chinese visitors at that time.
The methods that allowed Hinduism to survive the worst vicissitudes
continued to be effective, despite Western, Islamic, Christian, and Marxist
intrusions. As it is now lived, at the level of beliefs and rites as well as
philosophical concepts, Hinduism has not changed since it came into being at the
time of the great Shaivite revival in the Golden Age of the Guptas. Traditional
society prudently remains, however, on its guard, and for foreigners and
Westernized Indians, access to true Hinduism remains very difficult.
At a time when the scientific and metaphysical thought of the West is
drawing remarkably close to the concepts of Samkhya, as in the case of the so-
called Gnostics of Princeton, and when the very notion of polytheism has ceased
to be taboo, the attraction found by many young people for Bhakti and mystic
wandering is perhaps a prelude to a return to a conception of human and divine,
of love and what is sacred, that is close to those Shaivite concepts whose
rediscovery gave birth to the prodigious flowering of culture, art, and thought
that characterized Indian civilization from the third to the tenth centuries of our
era.

T
The Symbolism of the Linga
he symbol of Shiva, the Creator of the world, the image worshipped in his
temples, is the erect phallus, the linga. It is gripped in the female organ, the
yoni, but does not penetrate it. It rises victoriously out of it, like the column
of fire that rises from the earth’s entrails, known as the Linga of Light. The
Shiva Purana tells us that “The word linga means sign; the distinctive sign
through which the nature of something can be recognized is called linga.”1 It
also states that “The god Shiva himself is in reality without any sign (without
any sexual organ), without color, without taste, without smell, beyond the reach
of words or touch. He is without qualities, immutable, immobile.”2
The Linga Purana adds: “In the abstract, in which there is no distinguishing
sign, appears a sign that is the universe. This sign can be mentioned, touched,
breathed, seen, tasted. It is the origin of gross and subtle elements.”3
The godhead can only be perceived through its creation, which is its sign, its
linga. Its image is omnipresent in its work. In the microcosm, meaning the
human being, the sexual organ, the source of life, is the form in which the nature
of the abstract is manifest. However, the Shiva Purana says that “it is not the
phallus itself that is worshipped, but he of whom the phallus is the sign, the
Progenitor, the Cosmic Being. The phallus is the emblem, the sign of the person
of Shiva, of whom it is the image.”4
This is elucidated by Swami Karpatri in his Lingopasana Rahasya: “The
symbol of the Cosmic Man, Purusha, the plan of the universe, present in all
things, is the male emblem, the linga. The symbol of Energy, which is the
substance of the world, the generative force of all that exists, is the female organ,
the yoni.”5
“The center of pleasure is located in the sensual organ (upastha), in the
phallus and the yoni, whose union is the essence of all enjoyment. All love, all
sensuality, all desire, is a search for enjoyment. The godhead is an object of love
only because he represents undiluted sensual enjoyment. All enjoyment, all
pleasure, is an experience of the divine. The whole universe gushes forth from
the enjoyment.”6

THE LINGA OF LIGHT
The principle called Shiva can be represented as the axis of world manifestation,
which develops starting from the limit point, the bindu, the point from which the
universe arises. This world axis is represented as a pillar of light crossing the
universe from top to bottom.
In Yoga, the “subtle center located at the base of the spine is a triangle of
desire, knowledge, and action forming the yoni, in the center of which rises the
linga born-of-itself, shining like a thousand suns.”7
The principle called Shiva represents all the procreative power of the
universe. According to the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, “It is he alone who
penetrates all matrices.” Swami Karpatri elaborates:
The universe is the outcome of the relation of a linga and a yoni, of a form
and a substance. Everything consequently bears the signature of the linga
and the yoni. It is the deity who, in the form of the individual phallus,
penetrates each matrix and procreates all living beings. 8
In the sun, we worship the dispenser of light, the sum of all eyes.
Similarly, in the phallus, we worship Shiva, present in all procreative
power. It is not any particular eye that we worship and of which we make
images, but the sun, the total eye that gives us sight, the source of
visibility. Similarly, it is the entire Shiva that is worshipped, of which
images are made.9
And, according to the Skanda Purana, “Space is the linga, the earth is his
altar. In him reside all the gods. He is the sign, because everything dissolves in
him.”10
SEED: BIJA
Sperm is the seed (bija) of life. It is the best of oblations, the purest form of
sacrificial elixir (soma). All beings are born from the offering of sperm thrown
into the fire of desire. Agni, the lord of fire, is portrayed drinking the sperm that
shoots from Shiva’s phallus. The moon is the cup of soma, of sperm, that Shiva
wears on his forehead.
Sperm is called bija (seed), soma (oblation), chandra (moon), virya (virile
essence), and bindu (the point that separates the nonmanifest from the manifest).
Thus in the human being, the microcosm, the plan is contained in the male seed

and only becomes reality through the matter that nourishes it in the mother’s
womb, in the egg, the point from which every living being has its origin.
SEXUAL UNION: MAITHUNA
Swami Karpatri tells us that “Those who do not acknowledge the divine nature
of the linga, who do not understand the sacred character of the sexual rite, who
consider the act of love vile and despicable, or as a mere physical function, are
certain to fail in their attempts at material and spiritual realization. To ignore the
sacred character of the linga is dangerous, whereas by worshipping it one obtains
pleasure (bhukti) and liberation (mukti).”11
The Chandogya Upanishad compares the sexual act to sacred rites:
The first appeal is the invocation of the god (binkara). The invitation
represents the hymn of praise (prastara). Lying down close to the woman
is the hymn of glory (udgitha). Lying face to face is the choir (pratihara).
The orgasm is the consecration. Separation, the final hymn (nidhana).
Thus, the hymn to Shiva is woven out of the act of love. He who
understands that this hymn is based on the sexual act recreates himself at
every copulation. He lives long and becomes rich in progeny, cattle and
renown.12
By dominating the sexual instinct, we can acquire physical and mental
power. It is through sexual union that new beings come into existence. This
union thus represents a link between two worlds, a point where nonbeing and
being touch, where life is manifested, and where the divine spirit is incarnated.
The forms of the organs that accomplish this ritual are symbols. They are the
visible form of the Creator. When Hindus worship the linga, they are not
deifying a physical organ, but simply recognizing an eternal, divine form
manifested in the microcosm. The phallus is the image of the divine emblem, the
eternal, causal form of the linga, present in all things. The phallus is the godhead
“that goes beyond the width of ten fingers.”13
Transmission of the genetic code, its implantation in a rigorously chosen
terrain, the transfer to a new being of the ancestral heritage comprising the
archetypes that issued from the divine thought, is the most important religious
act in a man’s life. It must be considered as a rite and practiced according to very
strict rules taking various facts into account, including astrological data, so that
the new bearer of the torch is suited to his role and the species fashioned through

a long series of ancestors continues without being debased or dying out on the
way.
All religions, including Christianity, attribute a central ethical role to the
procreative act, even if they have lost its meaning and inverted its values: the
fault lies not in sexual amusement, but in mismatched fecundation.
The rites of procreation are carefully described in the Tantras. They include
worship of the organs, the images of the divine principles that will unite to
accomplish the miracle. Not seeing the image of the divine principle in the
procreative organs and not worshipping them as such is the first step toward
moral decay and the degradation of the species.
THE IMAGE
According to architectural treatises, Shiva’s emblem, the linga, is divided into
three parts. The lowest part is square, hidden in the pedestal. It represents
Brahma, the maker, the power of gravitation that forms the worlds. The central
section is octagonal and represents Vishnu, the centripetal force of concentration
that gives rise to matter. The top section is cylindrical and represents Shiva, the
centrifugal force of expansion, the bursting forth of form and matter. The linga is
gripped by the yoni, the receptacle. “The Universal Mother is his altar. The linga
itself is pure intelligence.”14
In the temple, the linga is placed at the center of the tabernacle, a dark cubic
chamber that is the garbagriha, the matrix of the temple. The axis of the erect
phallus determines the axis of the tower, up to its peak, thus evoking the Linga
of Light, the world axis.
Just as the temple roofs are covered with gold, the god’s emblem also is
sometimes fitted with a golden cap. This cap, known as kavacha, “the sheath,”
comprises certain symbolic elements of the god’s anthropomorphic image: the
three eyes, the crescent moon, the crown recalling his supreme royalty over all
beings and all the other gods. The cap can be used to transform the naked linga
into a linga with a face (mukha linga), meaning that the seed, the procreative
force, when sexually stimulated, can be controlled, directed, and absorbed by the
mental element.
The cap sometimes has five faces, making it a five-faced (pancha mukha)
linga. The faces represent those aspects of the god that govern the directions of
space and the zenith. The aspects of Shiva connected to the directions of space
are: Tat Purusha (eastward); Aghora (southward); Vama Deva (westward) and
Sadyojata (northward). Maha Deva, his transcendent aspect, faces the zenith. Tat

Purusha represents nature and the earth element; Aghora intelligence, the ether
element, and speech; Vama Deva, the notion of individuality, the fire element,
and sight; Sadyojata, the water element and the penis.
THE SNAKE
A snake winds around the linga and touches the orifice with its forked tongue.
Shiva wears a necklace of snakes. The snake is the image of latent, sleeping
energy, the source of sexual and mental power coiled up at the base of the spine,
which the yogi utilizes in his attempt to conquer the upper worlds during his
inner journey. The snakes protect Shiva. He wears snakes as ornaments and as a
sacred thread. According to the Grihya Sutra—the texts concerning domestic
rites—domestic offerings should be made to Shiva in places where snakes are
found.
Only Shiva the healer can control snakes: At the dawn of the ages, he was
the only deity able to save the world by drinking the poison that the snake
Vasuki spat into the ocean. The poison got jammed in the god’s throat, leaving a
blue mark on his neck.
THE LINGA BORN-OF-ITSELF: SVAYAMBU
Just as the god is everywhere incarnate in visible form, the linga itself is
manifest throughout the world. Objects appear, evoking the form of the divine
emblem. Thus, the “linga of ice” appeared in the Amarnath cavern, which
thousands of pilgrims go to worship every year.
In the sacred waters of the River Narmada, in central India, pebbles known
as shalagrama are found, which recall the form of the phallus. They are greatly
sought after and are collected and worshipped by many Hindus. As the Narada
Pancharatra tells us: “The god’s seed fell on the earth’s surface and filled the
world. It is this seed that caused the appearance of all the lingas of Shiva found
in the infernal world, on earth and in heaven.”15
THE SEXUAL BODY: LINGA SHARIRA
The living being is but a transient moment of the permanent reality that is the
species. Although insignificant individually, each living being is at the same
time essential as a link, like the links of a chain. He or she is like a relay bearer

of the Olympic torch, the conveyor of a model, a permanent code that is
transmitted from one individual to another.
Life’s main characteristic is its capacity to reproduce, continue, and transmit
itself. It evolves through thousands of generations. Man is called linga dhara,
the bearer or servant of his sexual organ. His personality is of no importance,
except to the very limited extent by which he may add some elements to the
code he has received and which he must transmit within the context of the
species to which he belongs. He is merely a link, but whereas good links
reinforce, bad links weaken the chain.
The transmittable permanent element, the code that defines the possibilities
of development for each individual, for each link, is included in the seed that
transmits it. It comes forth from man’s sexual organ just as the universe issued
forth from the linga, the divine phallus. According to the well-known treatise of
Shaivite cosmology, the Samkhya Karika:
The program, the sexual body, exists prior to the physical development of
its bearer. It is composed of intellect and other subtle faculties. But it can
only function if it becomes incarnate, even though it is independent of the
body. It is characterized by a Dharma, a “goal to be accomplished,” which
it carries with it at the moment when it quits one body to take on another.
To accomplish the goal assigned to it in creation, the sexual code, the
linga sharira, incarnate by the power of nature (pradhana), acts like an
actor playing one role after another.16
THE APPARITION OF THE LINGA
The Shiva Purana relates the following story about the linga:
There is an immense cedar forest called Daruvana, where numerous
hermits lived who were Shiva worshippers, meditating ceaselessly on the
Creator of the world. Thrice every day they performed the rites for the
god’s worship and sang hymns to his glory. One day, when the hermits
had gone off into the forest to seek sacred herbs used in the rites, Shiva—
in order to put their faith to test—manifested himself in a strange form. He
appeared resplendent, entirely naked. His body was smeared with ash,
with no other ornament. He stood there, holding his penis in his hand and
began to give an exhibition of obscene acts. Shiva had come to this place
to show his benevolence toward the forest-dwellers, his faithful followers.

The hermits’wives were initially frightened but, to their surprise, many
felt attracted and approached the god. Some tried to embrace him, others
seized his hands. They began to fight amongst themselves. At that
moment, the sages returned. Seeing a nude man in such a shocking
situation, they were scandalized and infuriated. Deceived by the power of
illusion and blinded by their prejudice, they cried “What is going on?
What does this mean?”
The naked sage made no reply. The hermits shouted terrible
imprecations at the man-god. “You are behaving indecently. You have
violated the rules of the Vedas. May your sexual organ fall to the ground!”
As soon as they had pronounced these words, the penis of the divine
envoy, Shiva with the splendid body, dropped to the ground. But it burned
everything before it, wherever it went all was burned. It went down to
hell; it climbed up to heaven; it ravaged the whole earth. Nothing was left
anywhere.
All the worlds and all beings were in distress. The hermits were
terrified. Neither gods nor sages would any longer know peace or joy. The
gods and hermits who had been unable to recognize Shiva were
consternated. They gathered together and went to the maker of the world,
the god Brahma, to implore his protection. After singing his praise, they
recounted to the god what had happened. Brahma said to them,
“Brahmans! How is it possible that you, who are sages, could make such
mistakes? How can you condemn poor ignorant beings for their faults if
you behave just like them? Who among you can hope for peace again,
after offending Shiva so badly? When someone refuses to honor an
unforeseen guest who appears at the door at dinnertime, all merits
acquired through the austerities are transferred to the visitor, who leaves as
a heritage the burden of his crimes. What will then happen if the visitor is
Shiva himself? Until the god’s penis is stabilized, nothing good will come
to the three worlds. That is the truth. The gods must do their utmost so that
the great goddess, the daughter of the mountains, Parvati, will take the
form of a vagina and grasp the divine phallus. Having taken the form of a
vagina, Parvati must form the pedestal on which the phallus will be
installed and worshipped with chants, perfumes, sandalwood, flowers,
incense and offerings.”17
LINGA WORSHIP

The Linga Purana teaches, “He who lets his life go by without having
worshipped the linga is truly pitiable. If on one side of the scales we put phallus
worship and on the other charity, fasting, pilgrimages, sacrifices, virtues, it is the
adoration of the linga, source of pleasure and liberation which protects from
adversity, that carries the day.”18
“He who worships the linga knowing that it is the prime cause, the source of
consciousness and the substance of the universe is closer to me than any other
being.”19
Why do we worship the linga? We worship it because it is the symbol of
permanence, the archetype that reveals the nature of Universal Man, Purusha.
Worshipping the linga means acknowledging the presence of the divine in what
is human. It is the opposite of anthropomorphic monotheism that projects human
individualism on to the divine world. In the instrument of procreation, we
joyfully worship the Creator principle, since the procreative organ is also the
instrument of pleasure, which, for a fleeting moment, gives us a glimpse of
divine bliss. The divine state is made up of three elements, which are existence,
consciousness, and sensual delight (sat chit ananda). Only sensual delight
belongs to the domain of experience. Through it therefore we have a foretaste;
we can touch the divine state.
The linga cult implies worshipping the world’s harmony and beauty, respect
for the divine work, for the infinite variety of forms and beings in which the
divine dream is manifested. It reminds us that each of us is merely an ephemeral
being and of little importance, that our sole role is to improve the chain we
represent for a moment in the evolution of our species and to transmit it. The
phallus cult consequently involves recognition that the species is permanent
compared to the impermanence of the individual, recognition of the principle
that establishes the laws from which we derive and not their accidental or
temporary applications, of the principle of life and not the living being, of the
abstract and not the concrete. It has implications at all levels, whether ethics, the
rites, cosmology, society, and so on.
Neglecting the linga cult in order to worship a person, whether divine or
human, is a form of idolatry, an outrage to the Creator principle. It is the sin of
pride, which seeks to reduce the divine to the image of the human. All the sacred
texts of Shaivism—the Puranas, the Tantras, and the Agamas—repeat that only
those that worship the divine phallus will be saved, that any society that
abandons its cult and respect for the sexual body is doomed to failure and will be
annihilated as were the Asuras, the race of humankind that preceded our own.


A
The Three Doors
ccording to the Samkhya, the transcendent Being who dreams up the world
is forever unknowable. When this indefinable Being wishes to give its
dream an appearance of reality, an emanation of its essence crosses the
barrier between the nonexistent and the existing, the indivisible (nishkala)
and the divisible (sakala). At this point, the Creator principle appears, the origin
of both world and beings. The latter are to be the witnesses, the spectators of the
divine game (lila) that is creation, thus giving it an apparent reality. The
divisible principle is formed of three inseparable components, the basis of all
that exists. They form the substance of the Creator and of the created. These
three components or doors are called existence (sat), consciousness (chit), and
felicity (ananda).
From the point of view of existence (sat), for any created being, whether a
star, an atom, or a living being, there are two crucial instants, known as
“passages” (dvara), corresponding to those moments when nonexistence and
existence touch each other, when the creator principle is in direct contact with
the created being. These two passages through which a living being enters into
contact with its Creator are birth and death. This is why the mother’s womb and
the funeral pyre are magical and sacred places. Ascetics venerate the
reproductive organs and smear their bodies with the ash of the funeral pyres in
their attempt to go closer (samipya) to the divine being.
The second door is consciousness (chit). Through knowledge, human beings
seek to understand the nature of the world and the secret of its origin. This is the
metaphysical way of Samkhya and its corollary Yoga, whose aim is to explore
the interior universe of the human being, the image of the Universal Man,
Purusha. It is also the way of asceticism, which—by controlling and mastering
the body’s impulses and energies—multiplies mental powers, making it possible
to open the door of the sentient being onto the secret nature of the world, which
the barriers of our senses prevent us perceiving.
The third door is sensual pleasure (ananda). It is mainly at moments of
sexual pleasure that we forget our human worries, our interests, and virtues, and
rediscover that state of happiness and enjoyment that is part of the nature of the
divine Being. In the act of love, we are most simply, most innocently close to the
divine and, if we know how to become aware of it, and perceive directly the
divine nature of sensual pleasure, here, too, we open the most direct and most

immediate passage between the human and the divine. This is why mystics
always express themselves in terms of physical love. It is not that vague glow of
benevolence for all creatures, called “love” in a devalued sense, but the
experience of intense happiness in which our being participates in the nature of
the divine and, eventually, collaborates in the mystery of the creation of life.
Tantric rites and practices, open to all without any restriction of caste,
gender, or nature, are meant to permit anyone to draw closer to the divine
through these three passages, on the levels of existence, consciousness, and
sensual pleasure. Tantric practices are many, because there is no aspect of the
created, no form of action that is not an image, a reflection, an expression of the
nature of the divine being. The substance of the world and of its Creator are one,
and each of these multiple aspects bears the mark of the triple nature of the
principle from which it has come forth.

W
Shaivism and Third Nature
ith regard to male-female relationships, Shaivite mythology considers
the world principle to be androgynous. The transcendent aspect of the
divine is half-female (ardhanari). The two aspects of the being separate
so that the spark of sensual pleasure can appear between them, which is why
their symbol is the linga, the erect phallus gripped by the vulva.
Although love is the aim of the separation of male and female principles, it is
not necessarily tied to procreation. The god and the goddess engender children
separately. Skanda, the god of beauty, leader of the heavenly armies, was born
from the offering of Shiva’s sperm into the mouth of the god Agni, the sacrificial
fire. Ganesha, the guardian of doors, issued from the skin of the goddess alone.
The elementary forms of matter and life multiply by parthenogenesis or by
mental projection. It was only later on in the order of creation that the uniting of
the sexes was utilized as an incitement to and an instrument of procreation.
Beneath the appearance of opposites, basic androgyny is always present and
plays an important role in any search for the divine.
We find three genders in all things: masculine, feminine, and the undivided
(or neuter). Texts on procreation rites, like the Shiva Svarodaya, explain how to
give birth to a male, female, or neuter child. Grammar recognizes these three
states or genders. The neutral gender is called nonmale (napunsaka). In the
human being, it covers all degrees of intersexuality. Nowadays this term is often
translated as “eunuch,” which is improper, because it is a question of nature and
not of any surgical transformation, although ritual castration is not unknown
among certain mystics, in India as in ancient Greece.
Every being is basically bisexual and the male-female ratio varies. In the
context of the traditional castes of India, the warrior is feminine as compared to
the priest, the merchant is feminine as compared to the warrior, and the peasant
is feminine as compared to the merchant.
MOHINI, THE ENCHANTRESS

The bisexual nature of the divine is reflected in certain myths of India. The god
Vishnu, who incarnates sattva, the force of world cohesion, is a masculine aspect
of the goddess. He is feminine as compared to Shiva, who represents tamas, the
original force of expansion. Vishnu is consequently often represented in an
effeminate form. Sometimes he is even completely transformed into a woman
and is called Mohini, the enchantress. In this guise, he undertakes to seduce
Shiva, and a son is eventually born from their union. This son is the Tamil god
Aiyanar Shasta, who is worshipped in the south of India. A similar story is told
in one passage of the Kanda Puranam in the Tamil language:
Vishnu, in the guise of the enchantress Mohini, went to repose near the
ocean of milk. Shiva wished to show the world that Vishnu was merely
one of his four wives. He drew near and manifested his desire to unite
with him. The god tried to refuse, saying that a union between persons of
the same sex was infertile. The Lord pointed out to him that he was only
the personification of his Shakti, of one of his powers, and this was why
he had been able to give birth to Brahma, the artisan-creator of the world,
who came forth from his navel. And that he had, moreover, taken the form
of a woman to seduce the hermits in the forest of Taruka, to distract them
from their ascetic practices through which they were developing powers
that threatened the supremacy of the gods.
Since Vishnu remained stubborn, the Lord took him in his arms and
bore him into the shade of a sal tree on the edge of the sea, to the north of
the continent of the rose apple tree. There he united with him. The sap that
they spread was transformed into a river, which took the name of
Ganges… . From the union of the Lord’s sperm with that of the dark-
skinned god was born a child with a black body and red hair, carrying a
bouquet in his hand. The three-eyed god (Shiva) named him the son of
Shiva-Vishnu (Ariharaputtiran). He granted him several gifts … as well as
sovereignty over one of the celestial worlds. When Ariharaputtiran
appeared before Indra, the king of heaven, mounted on a white elephant
and surrounded by the ganas, those delinquent adolescents who are
Shiva’s companions, the latter prostrated himself before him.1
This theme is also seen in the Ramayana: when the young hero god Rama
was exiled to the forest, the hermits who lived there were so excited by his
beauty that they forgot their spiritual exercises and sought physical contact with
him. Rama politely refused, saying that in this life he had taken a vow of fidelity
to Sita, his wife, but he promised them that, in their next existence, they would

all be reborn as cowgirls and he, in the form of Krishna, would then satisfy their
ardor.
HOMOSEXUALITY AND BISEXUALITY IN
TRADITION
Because they evoke the primordial hermaphrodite, any sexually ambiguous
being is of a sacred nature, whether they are physically or only instinctually
intersexual. Every bisexual being can be considered as an emanation of the god’s
transcendent aspect. The hermaphrodite, the homosexual, and the transvestite
thus have a symbolic value and are deemed to be privileged beings, images of
the Ardhanarishvara. By virtue of this, they are considered to bring good luck
and play a special role in magic and Tantric rites, as also in shamanism.
This magical aspect of intersexuality is found in all ancient civilizations. In
ancient literature, groups of transvestite prostitutes, united around a guru, had an
acknowledged place in society. Transvestite prostitutes are still found in most
Indian villages where they are regarded with contempt as well as respect. In the
popular theatre shows of Ramalila and Krishnalila, they are traditionally the ones
who act the part of the goddesses and shepherdesses. The presence of a
transvestite prostitute is still considered auspicious, particularly at a marriage
ceremony.
Among shamans, divinatory powers are connected with bisexuality. “The
final aim of Tantrism is to reunite the two polar principles Shiva and Shakti in
our own bodies… . Initiatic androgyny is not always marked by an operation as
among the Australians. In many cases, it is hinted at by dressing the boys as girls
and vice-versa the girls as boys… . Homosexual practices, witnessed in various
initiation ceremonies, can probably be explained by a similar belief, i.e., that the
neophytes, during their initiatic instruction, embody both sexes.”2
Divine androgyny can be evoked as a sadhana, a method of spiritual
realization. Some mystics seek to unite with the god they worship by becoming a
woman, dressing and living as such. This was the case, at the beginning of the
twentieth century, of Ramakrishna, who founded a religious order that bears his
name.
A great number of the wandering monks who transmit magic powers are
recruited from among those marked with the seal of the hermaphrodite, who by
nature are not inclined to procreation. Being outside the caste system, they act as
a bond between the various levels of society. A companion-disciple, who is both
lover and servant, often accompanies such monks.

As seen by Shaivism, homosexuality is a constant that can be observed in
any society. It is part of the reality of the created world and is thus a
manifestation of one aspect of the divine. Shiva’s son, Skanda, is opposed to
marriage and “has no other spouse than the army.” He is the male deity
worshipped by homosexuals and transvestites, who go in crowds on pilgrimage
to his sanctuary.
In traditional society, sexual practices among young people—what is known
as “schoolboy eroticism” (langa dost in Hindi)—are looked upon benevolently.
Purification rites are practiced as after any sexual act. In the social ethics derived
from Jainism, however, homosexuality is viewed as a deviance. This contrast
continues in Indian society down to our own times. India is both the land of the
Kama Sutra, of erotic temple sculptures, and of the most exacerbated puritanism.
Recent invaders, the Muslims then the British, have considerably accentuated
this latter aspect.
In modern society, despite that extreme puritanism displayed by the
anglicized governing class, homosexual practices traditionally present no
problem, except for persons with sacerdotal functions, who are ritually forbidden
to practice oral sex. Furthermore, for everyone, purification rites are obligatory
after any sexual act, which is something that foreigners do not always
understand.

T
Insights into Initiation
he notion of initiation is based on the principle of counterevolution, as
clearly shown in Hindu tradition, according to which the first humans were
sages, seers (rishis), still very close to the Creator and the gods, endowed
with vast knowledge, profound wisdom, and limitless powers. These sages
transmitted their powers to their disciples and to their descendents from
generation to generation. As the world degenerated through the four ages of
humankind, from the Age of Gold or Truth (the Satya Yuga) to the Age of
Conflicts in which we are now living (the Kali Yuga), transmission of powers
and essential knowledge has inevitably become increasingly limited, and
consequently more secret, since fewer and fewer persons are qualified to receive
certain knowledge.
Initiation has thus been reserved for an elite, forming groups that seek to
maintain islands of wisdom in the midst of a degenerating world and to preserve
the elements of knowledge, which—after the catastrophes that will end the Kali
Yuga—will be the seed of a new Golden Age. No prophet, no incarnation or
envoy of the gods enters human society without receiving an initiation into this
primordial tradition, considered as a second birth, of which Christian baptism is
a symbolic remnant. Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu, was initiated by the sage
Vishvamitra, while Jesus received his initiation from John the Baptist, an
Essene.
The final aim of initiation is total realization of the human being on a
spiritual level. This goal can only be reached in stages, successive steps. In every
profession, in any walk of life, there are in principle degrees of initiation marked
by rites of passage. In the modern world, these are sometimes fairly degenerate
and symbolic, except in cases where an element of continuity, an unbroken chain
of transmission, is maintained and where the rites maintain their properly
initiatic character and validity.
In any society that still conforms to the preestablished cosmological order,
different functions are distributed according to the aptitudes of the various
human groups. Just as we have hunting dogs, guard dogs, and sheepdogs, there

are also species of humans whose aptitudes fit them for the social roles of
hunters, shepherds, laborers, warriors, or intellectuals. The final goal of all
human existence is spiritual realization, but since the point of departure lies in
the social order, each grouping has its own distinct initiatic rites, stages, and
paths, according to caste or corporation.
The first stages of initiation are in some way selective, so that certain powers
will only be transmitted to qualified individuals, to exclude their being mastered
by persons who are not worthy or who are unsuitable. Many of the problems of
the modern West derive from the fact that people without the essential
qualifications and virtues required occupy key posts. With the rites of
consecration, the kings of France received certain powers of healing that the
presidents of the Republic do not possess, and such powers were an external sign
of the validity (though relative) of their kingly initiation.
TYPES OF INITIATION
There are four main kinds of initiation: initiation as a craftsman, initiation as a
king or warrior, priestly initiation, and spiritual initiation. In India, the last is
most often connected to a certain form of monastic life. The monk’s initiation
represents what we may term “high” initiation, through which knowledge of a
superior order is transmitted with its accompanying powers. Owing to their
absolute value and independence from material civilization, these monks form
the kernel into which tradition can retreat at times of disorder and crisis, without
its existence being suspected or its custodians known. Curiously, caste status has
nothing to do with this highest form of initiation, but only individual
qualifications.
Initiation of Kings and Farmers
Initiation as a warrior (which is also that of the kings) presents fairly elaborate
steps, since royal power plays a fundamental role in the stability of society. The
farmer’s initiation, on the other hand, is characterized by quite simple rites,
essentially linked to the fertility of the soil. Any initiation includes tests to
ensure that the recipient is worthy, since it requires the practice of certain virtues
and the courage to bear considerable responsibilities connected with the powers
transmitted.
The Bhagavad Gita deals with the hero Krishna recalling Prince Arjuna to
his duties as a warrior. His initiation, received from Drona, a qualified master,

requires him to be brave, to fight, even if it involves sacrificing his kin and
risking his life. He has no right to withdraw into pseudo-monastic life, for which
he is not qualified and which—for him—would represent cowardice, the
abandoning of his duties.
Farming rites are highly important in prehistoric society, which we wrongly
deem primitive; they tend to disappear in more complex societies. Such rites
may include forms of cannibalism, to assimilate the virtues and strength of the
person devoured, or sexual rites to ensure the fertility of the soil, as still
encountered in Africa. Christian rogations to obtain rain, or the similar Inca rites
still practiced in Peru, are remnants of traditional farming ceremonies. They
require the presence of an initiated shaman and it would be a mistake to doubt
their effectiveness a priori. I am sure that, returning to their true nature as human
beings in the face of the disasters that threaten agriculture nowadays, many
Westerners, who think that they are materialistic, would—if they knew them—
still practice the rites to invoke Indra, the rain-god. Worship of the earth that
nourishes us and the seasonal rites practiced in India are both connected to the
traditions of farming populations.
Initiation as a Craftsman
For craftsmen, initiation rites vary according to the social role of their
profession. By far the most important are those connected with architecture,
because they are linked to the symbolic and magical aspects of building temples,
the dwellings of the gods. A chief craftsman who is incapable or unaware of his
responsibilities can draw down the gods’curse on the temple and on the
kingdom. The architect or builder is also responsible for the correct design and
construction of human dwellings, in which proportion and orientation play an
essential role in ensuring that each part of the house is suited to a particular
function, with a benevolent rather than malign influence on its inhabitants.
Since the architect is responsible for the magical value of the temple and the
harmony of the home, admission into the builders’corporation is very strict, the
degrees of initiation are many, and the rules difficult. Builders are required to
gain a thorough knowledge of the symbols that convey the fundamental codes of
creation. Every substance in the universe, all matter, and every shape can, in
cosmological theory, be reduced to a ratio of forces expressed in turn by
numerical ratios. In every aspect of the world, the Samkhya looks for certain
constants representing the very principle of creation, which we may describe—to
use a modern term—as the genetic codes used by the Creator to give birth to the

world. If we manage to isolate some precise elements of these fundamental
codes, we can perceive the intimate nature of all things, and also pass from one
order of existence to another, since this basic data applies ineluctably to the
perceptible world just as it does to those worlds that are invisible to us, to the
intellectual sphere just as to the field of the senses, to the principles of vegetal or
animal life as it does to the structures of matter.
It is these basic data that are called “the symbols.” There is nothing arbitrary
about real symbols. On the contrary, they are the expression of the deepest
reality of all things. That is why the use of symbolic diagrams or formulas in the
construction of temples ensures that they are places of real communication with
the transcendent worlds, the exact representation of both the world of the living
and of the heavenly worlds. Such diagrams, the geometric expressions of
transcendent realities, serve as a basis for any architectural structure. In the case
of temples, the diagrams differ according to the aspect of the deity whose
presence is to be attracted there.
For homes, the diagram is schematized in human form, called purusha. The
house can be oriented differently according to the profession of its occupants,
and the various parts of the body of the purusha will determine which areas of
the house are suited to sleeping, work, or study, for use as kitchens or
bathrooms, for procreation or pleasure. The love chamber—the rati mahal—is
usually on the first floor, which is not where the residents sleep. Furthermore,
the proportion of the rooms and the openings is highly important and has a
profound effect on the people living there. These symbolic rules are universal in
character, and we find traces of them everywhere. They are transmitted through
the craftsman’s initiation to suit changes in religion or culture. Often, the master
craftsman does not know their meaning, but he observes the tradition.
In sculpting the images of the gods, the craftsman traces on the stone the
diagram corresponding to the characteristics of the divine aspect he envisages,
then—while carefully observing its delimitations—he gradually releases from
the stone the image that is hidden within. This is the opposite of the process used
by Leonardo in his drawings to determine the proportions of a human body. In
this case, the body is recreated according to the principles of its subtle nature.
Erotic sculpture plays a very important role because the related diagram
reconstructs in human form the complete being before its division. The supreme
deity can be represented by the aspect of the perpetual copulation of Shiva and
Shakti, or in the form of the Ardhanarishvara, the hermaphrodite, that aspect of
Shiva that unites within itself the two complementary male-female principles,
thus representing the primordial aspect of the divine.
At all times, the true craftsman must be aware of the importance of his role

in society and the value of his role. On the day of worship of Sarasvati, the
goddess of the sciences, the use of tools is forbidden, whether compass, hammer,
book, or musical instrument. They are placed on an altar and venerated as
vehicles of the goddess, with flowers, incense, and ritual offerings.
Sacerdotal Initiation
Sacerdotal initiation is the most widely known, because priests play an essential
role in the ordinary ceremonies of all religions and all castes, whether baptisms,
marriages, funerals, or temple services. It is the priest, who, through his rites and
ceremonies, integrates human beings into the social order, thereby establishing a
kind of correspondence between the divine plan and human society. The initiated
priest possesses the power to invoke the real presence of the deities in the
symbol, temple, or image, and then to liberate the supernatural force that he has
captured.
Sacerdotal initiation takes place in various steps, each of which implies the
acquisition of certain knowledge. Thus, the apprentice has to learn the sacred
language and ritual formulas. These, however, remain a dead letter until he
receives them orally from a master qualified to transmit them. In the Christian
church, this is the case of the consecration formula. The magical transmutation
of bread and wine into the flesh and blood of Christ only takes place if the
mantra, the magic formula, has been transmitted orally, following a certain ritual
and without interruption, by priests ordained in a chain originating from the Last
Supper. The apparent meaning of a mantra has only secondary importance, just
as it cannot be translated without losing its magical effect.
The Vedic mantras are lifeless, powerless, if oral transmission is interrupted.
The only value of books is as a memorandum. The inner vision, the realization
of the mantra’s power is described as an extraordinary experience, like a lamp
that ignites itself to illuminate everything around it.
Sacerdotal initiation comprises four stages. During the first, the child whose
birth predestines him for this function receives a name and is thus incorporated
into a particular tradition. A Hindu will not be called Mohammad, or a Muslim
Krishna. It is a curious fact that in secular France, the town hall sometimes
refuses to register babies with a Breton name, because that name is not included
in the calendar of Christian saints. In actual fact, worship of the empire’s gods is
a fundamental element in the cohesion of any society, and some initiatic
elements still exist in societies that claim to be most liberated.
The second sacerdotal initiation takes place when the boy is about twelve, on

the threshold of adolescence, when he leaves the women’s quarters. Called
yajnopavita among the Hindus, its essential feature is the handing over of the
sacred thread, considered as a second birth. From this moment on, the boy is
deemed sufficiently responsible to follow the strict rules of ritual purification
and take part in the ordinary rites, particularly the puja, or ritual worship of the
image or symbol of a god, the veneration of his master, of the sacred books and
cult and work accessories. Thereafter and up to the end of his studies, the
candidate for priesthood has to practice ritual purifications, serve his guru, and
observe certain rules of life.
At the end of his studies, he receives initiation into the priesthood and a
secret name. The magical mantras will be whispered into his ear in an isolated
place, usually a forest or a riverbank, or a sacred pool, never in a house or
temple, because the temple is for worshipping the god. The temple is the god’s
dwelling and not a place for practicing rites concerning human beings. That is
why the public is not admitted to the sanctuary, just as they are not admitted to
the king’s apartments.
After the initiation ceremony giving him the power to perform the rites, the
neophyte has to wear a yellow robe and take up the pilgrim’s staff. He must visit
the holy places while begging his food. The journey is at the same time an outer
symbol of the inner journey the adept has to accomplish to achieve final
realization. In practical terms, the journey is often reduced to a mere symbolic
promenade. The symbolism of the journey (safar) is found among the Islamic
Sufis, as a practice of detachment.
It is only after this pilgrimage that the priest’s marriage ceremony can take
place, arranged according to caste, degree of kinship, and the concordance of
horoscopes, which will ensure fully the continuation of a sacerdotal dynasty.
Thus the marriage of brahmans always takes place rather late, although the
betrothal has been arranged much earlier, according to caste rules, with a girl
whom the husband will see for the first time at their marriage ceremony.
Brahmans are forbidden to have many children, since the caste must not be
numerous.
India also has nonbrahman families of priests belonging to castes considered
as workers (shudras). These shudra priests are perfectly qualified for all temple
rites and services. Their initiatic lineage goes back to the remotest periods of
protohistory and comes from the Shaivite-Dionysiac religion. In fact, Shaivism
is the origin of initiation and of the rites known as Tantric, which—according to
this tradition—are the only ones that are really effective in the Kali Yuga, the
age in which we are living. In the Vedic tradition, on the other hand, the god
Shiva is accused of having revealed the secrets of initiation to the shudras, the

humble, who do not belong to the “chosen” Aryan race. The two traditions
continue to coexist everywhere in India. In some temples, like the Lingaraja at
Bhuvaneshwar in particular, services are performed alternately by brahmans and
by shudra priests.
It is only in the Shaivite tradition that persons born in civilizations that do
not observe the rules of caste may be really assimilated and may have access to
all degrees of initiation, if they prove that they have the necessary qualifications.
In the Shaivite tradition alone can persons belonging to the craftsmen’s castes or
even born outside the sacred land of India have access to all degrees of initiation.
This is so particularly for Westerners. Every one of us must seek to realize
ourselves, based on the reality of what we are by birth, with the aptitudes,
qualities, and status we possess. A black cannot become a white, nor a shudra
become a brahman. Once we have fully realized our state of being, we can go
beyond it and achieve further realizations, but we cannot change our category on
a social level.
Traditional society is thus like a pyramid, in which the four faces (the four
castes) only meet at the summit. Most Westerners who have sought to identify
with Hinduism have failed because they did not wish to admit to the principle
that, if they had had the necessary qualifications for being brahmans—that is,
exercising the priesthood in Hindu society—they would have been born in India
and not elsewhere. It is interesting to note that all the pseudo-Hindu sects that
now abound in the West are Vaishnavite and devotional in character and can in
no case lead to any real integration with the Hindu world, or to any true
initiation.
Once married, a priest may exercise all his priestly and ritual functions and
transmit initiation. He becomes a link in the initiatic line that starts from the
sages of the earliest times, through which are transmitted the powers they
received from the gods. Should any doubt arise as to the continuity of the
initiatic tradition and consequently as to the validity of the rites, the god Vishnu,
who ensures the world’s continuity, becomes incarnate and reorders the
tradition, utilizing any surviving elements. This is what is known as an avatar, a
descent. Hindu tradition speaks of ten descents (avatara) and even mentions a
mleccha avatar, an incarnation among the Western barbarians, who has
occasionally been identified with the Master of Justice, or Jesus Christ.
Indeed, it is by direct intervention that initiatic rites can be transferred from
one religion to another. It should be noted that sacerdotal initiation is
Vaishnavite in character. Vishnu is the aspect of the divine that tends to preserve
the world and ensure its continuation, whereas Shiva is not only its principle but
also its destroyer, its liberator. The sacerdotal aspect of religion thus contains an

element of obscurantism, the rules of conduct that protect society and its
institutions. Churches are consequently conservative and not liberating. The
search for knowledge, for liberation from the chains of existence, is part of the
Shaivite initiation, which we may term “high” or “spiritual” initiation.
Monastic or Hermetic Initiation
In the four castes, initiation refers to the social person’s participation in the
cosmological rite, in the work of the Creator, in maintaining society, and
improving human conditions as a whole on the spiritual level. Monastic
initiation is quite another kind and is placed at a different level. Its aim is the full
realization of the individual on the spiritual level, beyond all contingencies.
Monastic initiation can only be granted to people chosen to transmit the
highest secrets of knowledge and of the final human destiny. They belong to no
caste, no social circle. Their hierarchy is secret and at its head is that omniscient
being, who has sometimes been called the King of the World. They only belong
marginally to the society of humankind, in their public teachings and directives.
It is only when the survival of traditional society is threatened that some of them
may be delegated to take part in the action, “go down with the brahmans to the
field of battle,” as the law of Manu says.
When the King of England, India’s legitimate suzerain, betrayed his treaties
with the princes and gave up sovereignty in favor of a political party, there
appeared in India persons clothed in the monastic dress, of astonishing
intelligence and culture, who, within a few months, set up a traditionalist party,
magazines, newspapers, and youth movements, which rose against Gandhi,
Nehru, and the Indian Congress Party. Today they form a strong opposition,
which, at the right time, will take power and reestablish the traditional order, if,
however, humanity as a whole can still be saved from the catastrophe that looms.
When part of humankind is deemed to be heading for destruction, the
hermetic tradition may close up within its shell and stay there unknown until a
new humanity arises that is deserving of its message. Usually, in India, the
bearers of esoteric tradition don the orange robe of the saddhus, the wandering
monks, who have no family, no attachments, no fixed dwelling, nor material
possessions. They mix with the crowds of pilgrims and begging monks, and it is
difficult at first sight to recognize them. Their powers are immense, their
knowledge incredible. They possess the gift of languages, and an extraordinary
memory. They can quote, without the slightest error, any of the sacred texts,
which, in India, form a vast literature. They can speak even with the most savage

animals, which do not fear them, and come to lie down at their feet. It is their
duty to teach, wherever they may be, the myths, the moral virtues, elementary
wisdom, whatever will help consolidate traditional society. This has nothing to
do with their true role, however, which is magical and mysterious. They can read
minds and see the future. They know human destiny and do their best to aid a
society that is racing to its destruction. They are the guardians of a secret
treasure of knowledge for the future of humankind.
When world conditions demand and some form of action is required,
qualified persons—while remaining in the world—may receive what we may
term a virtual initiation, which cannot as a rule be transmitted, but which allows
them to play an exceptional role in human society. Some of these mysterious
“initiates,” like Christian Rosenkreuz, or Nicolas Flamel, or even Rasputin, who
have appeared at certain moments in the Western world, most probably belonged
to this category.
No one knows the degrees and rites of monastic initiation, except so far as
the very first stages are concerned, which are similar to the final initiation of
brahmans, because those who are admitted to this path never turn back and if
they halt on the way, their destiny can be frightful, since they risk falling into the
maleficent circuits of counterinitiation.
CEREMONIES
Initiation consists of transmitting the powers, aptitudes, and—eventually—
intuitive knowledge of an initiated human being whose own powers come from
supernatural sources. We cannot exclude the possibility of direct initiation by a
supernatural being, but it would appear to be contrary to the rules of initiative
transmission and, in such a case, it is difficult to know whether the initiating
power is beneficent or malevolent. Mystics fall into one category and certain
magicians into the other, since the latters’powers may derive directly from
maleficent powers. This fact has often reinforced popular confusion between
initiates and magicians, inasmuch as both possess exceptional powers. The
history of the Christian world is sadly filled with witch-hunts that have served as
a pretext for attacking initiatic organizations, instigated by “black” magicians
playing on public credulity.
It was indeed the forces of destruction, which, infiltrating among those who
held material and religious powers, attacked the initiatic traditions, making the
Christian world a spiritual desert without a force that can stop its course to
destruction. Knowledge and power then fall into irresponsible hands. Only very

recently, a similar phenomenon has appeared in India, and a major Western
pseudo-initiatic society has played an important role in this field.
In any hierarchic society based on initiation—and consequently conforming
to cosmic or divine order—no science or form of knowledge can be transmitted
to anyone unworthy of it, anyone who does not shoulder the accompanying
responsibilities. Democratic teaching of all kinds of knowledge, even the most
dangerous, without taking into account the moral value of the apprentices, can
only lead to disaster. Even now, we see the results of this kind of folly, since it is
by the generalized spreading of profane science that the end of this cycle of
humankind is being prepared.
In a traditional society, knowledge cannot be sold, thus teaching cannot be
had for money, and science is not squandered in the market place. A brahman
teaching at a university and receiving a salary for it is, on principle, excluded
from his caste and from any future initiation. It is due to these rules that in India
there is an extraordinary difference in level between the teaching of the
traditional scholars and that of the universities. The teaching of the scholars
attains an incomparably higher level, even on a strictly exoteric plane.
Apart from the teaching that accompanies the various stages, the degrees of
initiation are transmitted in the form of secret ceremonies, from person to
person. The related rites are, generally, quite simple, especially with regard to
the first degrees of monastic initiation, whose aim is not social and concerns
only the transmission of spiritual values.
The apprentice who has received advanced teaching and has shown himself
worthy of it, who practices the ordinary rites and purifications faultlessly and has
demonstrated his attachment to traditional values, is admitted to the first
initiation, administered by an intermediary on the order of a full initiate. The
intermediary has himself already received an advanced order of initiation. He
becomes the apprentice’s guru and is owed respect and obedience, since he is
taking on a responsibility similar to that of physical paternity, yet even more
serious because it is a spiritual paternity.
The day is chosen according to astrological findings, and the apprentice
prepares himself by fasting. He must then shave his hair and all his body hair
except his eyebrows and eyelashes. He then takes a ritual bath and puts on a new
and seamless garment. He accompanies his guru to an isolated place and sits
facing west or south in a yoga posture before his master, who thus faces him
looking eastward or north, as the case may be. The guru lays his hands on the
apprentice and pronounces certain mantras, after which he whispers into his ear
the secret mantra by which the apprentice will contact the supernatural world,
which will be the basis of the rites he will perform and which will protect him

from evil. He also gives him his secret name, connected with the deity the
apprentice prefers to worship. He gives him a cord, which he will wear around
his waist, beneath his clothes. After this, the apprentice worships his guru like a
god, with flowers, fruit, water, offerings, and incense (representing the five
elements), which are the spheres of perception of the five senses.
Later, the Grand Master will give him a rosary of wild seeds with 108 beads,
which he will wear around his neck and use to repeat—three times a day—the
mantra he received at his initiation. He may henceforth attend some of the
teachings that the Grand Master imparts to his followers.
In monastic initiation there is no public ceremony, whereas public rites often
follow royal and sacerdotal initiations. In the initiation of craftsmen, the new
apprentice or companion is received into the corporation with rites and tests that
publicly affirm his new rank.
TANTRIC INITIATION
In dealing with initiation, we cannot ignore Tantric initiation, which utilizes
elements of a sexual nature. In the Christian world, these have often been the
cause or more often the pretext for persecuting initiatic groups, whether such
rites were practiced or not. Associating the demoniac with the sexual is peculiar
to the Christian world. This is probably due to the fact that Dionysian rites—in
which direct contact with the supernatural world was sought through states of
ecstasy involving the whole of the human being—continued to be the true
religion of the ancient world, against which Christianity was attempting to assert
itself. “Evil is whatever is pagan” wrote the Christian historian Orosius in the
fifth century.
It is relatively easy to overthrow state religions and official cults by replacing
the gods of the conquered with those of the conquerors, while maintaining the
same rites, which is what imperial Rome did without any great shock in the
countries it conquered. Christianity followed this practice in certain regions.
Erotic-mystic rites, however, and their powerful effect on the participants, had
either to be assimilated or violently rejected by the new religion. Assimilation is
the only way to maintain the continuity of any true mystic experience. This was
the case with Mahayana Buddhism, which assimilated Tantric Shaivism and its
rites, and also with Islam, where Sufism represents an assimilation of ecstatic
ceremonies and an erotic-mystic approach to the divine. The Sufi zikhr
(rhythmic chanting) scarcely differs from the Greek dithyramb (wild ecstatic
hymn to Dionysus), which corresponds to the Hindu kirtana (hymn of glory). In

the UNESCO record collection, I have published a Syrian zikhr and a zikhr
recorded in Yugoslavia, which are closely related to the Greek Dionysian rites.
Numerous sects did their utmost to maintain a Dionysian type initiatic
tradition in the Christian world but were ferociously persecuted for political
reasons, which have nothing to do with truly religious values. Organisms whose
aims are purely spiritual are thus persecuted when civil and ecclesiastical
authorities seek to establish their total hegemony over souls. The Catholic
Church has played this sinister role throughout the ages, just as Nazism and
Marxism have done in our own times. The pretext of erotic devil worship was
one of the arms used to destroy initiatic traditions. In actual fact, some initiatic
groups managed to maintain their spiritual traditions in spite of public authorities
and the churches.
In India, Shaivism—of which the Dionysian religion is only the Western
branch—resisted first Vedic then Buddhist puritanism and has regained its
predominant place in modern Hinduism with its essential method, which is Yoga
in all its forms. Yoga is the only method whose aim is to determine the subtle
structures of the human being, to define the human being’s latent powers and to
perceive those aspects of the material and immaterial world that are inaccessible
to the senses. Only Yoga can explain the raison d’être of the powers transmitted
by initiation. A person’s real body is the subtle body, in which the centers of
consciousness and vital and spiritual energies are located very differently from
those that appear in the physical body. In the effort of introspection, having
reduced the mind’s agitation to silence, the yogi descends to the deepest part of
the self. It is in the region of the sexual organs that one attains pure knowledge,
nonmanifest intellect, and becomes aware of the cosmic being, hiranyagarbha,
the “egg of light.” Tantric theory establishes a link between the inner organ, pure
intellect, the world principle, and the outer organ, the procreative organ, the
source of life; it considers all other vital sensory or mental functions as
secondary.
The divine is manifest in the form of consciousness and life. Consciousness
is never inert, or lifeless. In the microcosm, the transmission of life is equivalent
to the creation of the cosmos. It is essentially a divine act. According to Tantric
principles, a man is merely “the bearer of his phallus.” His whole being is
conditioned by this procreative purpose, since it is through a succession of living
beings that life, consciousness, knowledge, and initiatic powers are transmitted.
At the same time, since the divine state is a state of total well-being, it is in the
instant of procreative pleasure that a person is closest to god and glimpses divine
bliss. The divine state thus has as its image that spark of bliss that derives from
the uniting of the procreative organs. Shiva is represented in the form of an erect

phallus, in perpetual union with the female organ, an image of Shakti, the
primordial energy from which the world came forth. The mother is a receptacle
that receives the seed and from which the living being comes forth.
In Tantric theory, it is through practices of an erotic nature that the initiate
can feed the energies needed for action, overcome all obstacles, and draw near to
the divine. This is not merely through procreation alone, but through the
illuminating nature of pleasure. Any sexual act can be organized as a magic rite.
It is at the moment of sexual union that we can in some way couple up to the
divine, since, according to the Chandogya Upanishad, the enlightening nature of
pleasure can become the starting point for true experience of the divine state.
The energy coiled up at the base of the spine can then mount through the
various centers of the subtle body, wakening all one’s latent powers, and reaches
the open door at the top of the skull through which the adept can leave the
material body and unite with the divine. Such experience, which demands from
the very start the suppression of all the mind’s agitation, is both difficult and
dangerous, requiring a reliable guide and rigorous initiatic discipline. The
degrees of Tantric initiation are complex and its rites extremely secret.
According to the Tantras, there are two ways to spiritual and mystic
realization: the right-hand way, which utilizes the energy diffused in the human
being, and the left-hand way, which finds its direct support in procreative energy
and utilizes transfigured sexual experience. The latter is the quickest and most
effective way, but most dangerous, since the powers it unleashes can become
insurmountable obstacles if one stops. It is thus that magicians are created, being
in fact fallen adepts.
It is very important to know Tantric initiation, since all groups seeking
mystical experience utilize the language and the symbols of love, even if in
practice Tantric ritual is excluded. Tantric rites are of two kinds, according to
whether the predominant aspect is the female principle, or Shakti, in which the
female organ is worshipped as the primordial cave whence the human race came
forth, or Shaivite rites, in which the phallus is worshipped as the source of life.
In the final analysis it seems that all initiation is ultimately connected with
Shaivism, or with its kindred Dionysian or Sufi forms. Traces of such an origin
can be detected in authentic initiatic groups in the Christian, Vedic, Taoist,
Buddhist, and Islamic worlds.
The transmission of certain initiatic powers is independent of the value of the
individual. The initiatic seed, like the seed of life, can be transmitted through
many insignificant generations and regains its bloom at the right moment.
Naturally, the tests the neophyte undergoes aim at selecting worthy candidates.
One must be careful, however, in seeking to judge an initiatic tradition by some

of its representatives, who may be merely its vehicles, or who may have only an
apparent role, serving to mask the true holders of initiatic power.
In view of the rise of materialism and the aberrant, irresponsible, and
inhuman egalitarian theories that are a feature of the Kali Yuga, announcing the
destruction of the greatest part of humankind, only initiatic societies can keep
alive that spark of spiritual life and transmit those essential truths that will allow
some of humanity to survive the catastrophe. They represent the soul of the
social body. Whether Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, or Christian, such authentic
initiatic societies are the only ones that practice the methods by which we can
reconquer wisdom, draw near to the divine, and realize our transcendent nature.

D
The Science of Dreams
reams—why they occur and their meaning—have always been a subject
of wonder and curiosity. The prophetic value of certain dreams has been
the subject of speculation and attempted interpretation in all civilizations.
In India, the theory of dreams and search for their meaning appear in
various works under the general heading of Svapna Vichara (the interpretation
of dreams).
Dreams are of various kinds. Their nature can be analyzed in relation to
theories about the siddhis, the subtle powers belonging to the structure of living
beings, which usually remain latent in the unconscious. Dreams take shape as the
formulation of logical thought, based on innumerable data stored in our memory,
which our thought mechanism keeps ceaselessly in movement. This inner
element may be accompanied by external elements, which may be extrasensory
perceptions, beyond the limits of time and space, or the intrusion of an external
thought coming from living or subtle beings. The various elements making up
the oneiric process must consequently be distinguished and the various kinds of
dream considered separately.
ANCESTRAL MEMORY: JATI SMARANA
Certain elements of our genetic memory are connected to the transmission of
life. It is on this basis that the fetus dreams that it is moving, walking, or feeding.
At birth, the living being is ready for action. A chick, breaking out of the
eggshell, already knows how it must behave. The human baby works by starts
and fits for a long time, incapable of utilizing the knowledge contained in its
genes. Some elements in our genetic memory may survive from a very distant
past: experiences, situations, visions, and characters that have impressed one of
the ancestors of our lineage. This is jati smarana, our ancestral memory.
EXTRASENSORY POWERS: SIDDHI

According to Yoga theory, our powers of perception are much wider than the
limitations of our senses. Yoga practices allow us to overcome these limitations,
which also disappear in the state of sleep. Some of these powers allow us to
perceive far-off objects and places. This visionary power is called drikshakti. We
can also take part in events far from us in time—whether past or future—thanks
to the power known as prakamya (transfer). Thus, in a dream we may perceive
an accident or a death taking place on another continent, or take part in some
past or future event in a place we have never seen. We may also be present at an
event that has not yet taken place. Such powers form part of our “internal organ”
(antahkarana), or “transmigrant body” (linga sharira), according to Yoga
definitions. These are our psychomental structures and remain latent. As a rule
they are not accessible in a waking state, unless we manage to control them
through Yogic introspection. They also contribute a vast amount of material to
the formation of our dreams.
THOUGHT COMMUNICATION
Another of the siddhis is thought communication, a frequent phenomenon and
easily practiced. Sometimes we perceive a shock, a call, or a drama concerning
someone close to us, by means of some kind of mental radio wave.
INSPIRED OR PROPHETIC DREAMS
Yoga also teaches a technique that allows our vital energy to penetrate another
person, and even to reanimate the dead. By a similar process, a spirit, or subtle
being, can take possession of a living being and speak through his mouth. Thus
magicians, as well as subtle beings (spirits or gods), express themselves through
the mouth of a medium in trance. This also happens in the case of prophets. The
phenomenon is equally found in the form of prophetic dreams. In dreams, our
guardian angel or a benevolent deity can warn us of dangers that loom and tell us
how to avoid them.
Since logical thought is suspended during the state of sleep, the various
sources from which a dream can draw its material are difficult to differentiate.
Works on the interpretation of dreams—as numerous in India as elsewhere—
seek to establish their characteristics, the presence of certain symbolic elements
that make it possible to determine the character and nature of a particular dream.
The different elements that come together to form a dream are, however,
essentially personal and contingent. Although there is no doubt as to the

existence of prophetic dreams, their sources and components are different in
each case.

A
Poetry and Metaphysics
lthough most mantras—verbal formulas enabling communication with the
invisible—are monosyllabic, some are not. These longer mantras are based
on chandas, poetic meters, which correspond to talas, the rhythmic
formulas of music. Vedic texts are mentioned as chandas, underlining their
magical and sacred power.
THE SACRED METERS
According to their numerical characteristics, meters correspond to the yantras,
geometric formulas of magic diagrams, as well as to the harmonic ratios of ragas
(musical modes) and talas (rhythms). Repeating them leads to the attainment of
an ecstatic state and evokes the nature and presence of supernatural beings. All
rites are based on a chandayantra-mudra (word-diagram-gesture) combination.
In sacred poetry, esoteric knowledge is transmitted through the chandas. The
apparent meaning of the words is not necessarily their true meaning, which
remains secret. The essence of poetry—whether sacred or profane—lies in its
ambiguity, in its multiplicity of meanings. Each verse of the Vedas has thirty-
two different meanings, applied to the various forms of knowledge, the sciences,
and the arts.
Besides magic formulas themselves, which have no apparent meaning, all
traditional knowledge is transmitted through chandas, that is, in versified form,
ensuring the oral transmission of sacred texts, even through individuals who do
not understand their meaning. This is true of all traditions that have preserved
the magical character of esoteric transmission. Their versified form guarantees
the permanence of the formulas and texts and avoids any distortion.
PSALMODY
According to Hindu grammarians, all languages were originally tonal. The

chandas’metric elements possess an inseparable melodic content. Psalmody is an
essential aspect of the transmission and power of sacred texts. In all civilizations
belonging to the oral tradition, bards—who are in some way living books, and
thereby possess magic powers—chant poetry.
Sacred poetry is thus a privileged tool for contacting the supernatural and
transmitting esoteric knowledge. Chanda structures, which are parallel to those
of the yantras and svaras (musical notes), reflect cosmic order and facilitate
communication between different states of being. Rites do not exist without
sacred formulas, without magical texts versified according to the rules of poetic
meter.
MYSTICAL POETRY
At the same time, certain periods see the rise of mystical poetry, in which the
apparent meaning predominates. This kind of poetry, connected to bhakti
(devotion), helps those that sing it enter into states of mystical exaltation. It is,
however, an already degenerate form of poetry, connected with religiosity. In no
case can it be considered as having any metaphysical aspect, and it only
flourishes in forms of religion that are the refuge of those in distress during the
Kali Yuga.
SECULAR POETRY
This form of poetry has in turn given birth to secular and erotic poetry, which, as
the Greeks noted, comes from the dithyramb. In India, too, the origin of the
theater lies in the kirtana, the chanted narrations of the bards recounting the
adventures of the gods.
Every inspired poet can instinctively find certain essential meters, as well as
that poetic ambiguity that gives a universal value to the expressed meaning. In
the modern world, poetry often finds its evocative force only when sung. The
harmony of the svaras provides it with a dimension that is otherwise lacking.


I
The Cock
t seems to me that many modern works on ethnology and the history of
religions rather neglect the interpenetration of cultures and ancient sources.
For example, they rarely mention the way in which Cretan Dionysism—
which was the religion of the Mediterranean world prior to the Dorian
invasions—profoundly influenced Greek and Roman religion and, through them,
the Christian world. It has left its traces everywhere in the popular religion of the
Western world.
Many of the rites, beliefs, and symbols of Cretan Dionysism were closely
related to those of pre-Aryan Shaivism in India. Such is the case of bull worship
and sacrifice—the bull being Shiva’s vehicle—found in Cretan, Greek, and
Mithraic rites, and still existing today in the Spanish corrida.
In Shaivism the cock is the vehicle of Skanda, the virgin god of beauty and
war, who came forth from Shiva’s phallus, without any participation of the
goddess. Skanda means the “spurt of semen.” Having fallen into the mouth of
Agni (the sacrificial fire) and thence into the sacred waters of the Ganges,
Skanda was raised by the Pleiades. Skanda, whose cult is forbidden to women, is
also known as “the adolescent” (Murugan in Dravidian, Kumara in Sanskrit,
Kuros in Crete). In Sanskrit he is also Shanmukham (of the six faces),
corresponding to the Sumerian Sumugan. The temples of medieval India contain
innumerable images of Skanda, the leader of the gods’army, with his cock.
The familiar European representation of a cock on top of a belfry—the
phallic symbolism and warrior nature of which have often been noted—bears a
rather curious analogy to the symbolism of Skanda. It bears witness to parallels
between Shaivism and survivals of Dionysiac traditions in popular religion, in
spite of Christianity.
Its representation also recalls probable relations, starting from the tenth
century, between the guilds of Hindu architects and European cathedral builders,
whose plans, orientation, and proportions are based on the same diagrams as the
temples of India. The appearance of the bell tower, unknown in earlier temples,
also recalls such an influence. Masonic associations, too, have preserved rites
and symbols identical to those of the Hindu guilds. The Celts preserved the bull
cult: why not that of the cock?

T
The Nature of Beauty
According to the Samkhya
he notion of beauty is one of the most ambiguous and difficult to define.
The word is employed to describe the harmony of a landscape, the quality
of light, the perfection of a certain type of animal, the nobility of a
symphony, the (erotic) attraction of a human being, or the perfection of a piece
of architecture. The artists of ancient Greece and of the Italian Renaissance often
sought to establish the ideal proportions of the human body for architectural
purposes, but these did not necessarily lead to a general theory of beauty. Plato’s
definition “adaptation to custom” is merely an evasion, an avowal of ignorance.
For Shaivite cosmogony, the harmony of proportions, based on numerical
ratios, is the secret of both material and living structures. Whatever exists is
based on geometric elements, that is, numerical ratios. It is the diversity of
harmonies—of proportional ratios—that gives rise to the various sorts of beings
and constitutes their beauty. The world’s nature is harmony, and the Creator’s
design is expressed in its beauty. It is by perceiving this beauty that we have
some intuition of the secret of creation and the nature of the divine.
In order to evoke the origin and nature of the world, the Creatorgod is
symbolically represented as a dancer who, by means of the variety of rhythms
and gestures of his dance—the tandava—gives birth to all sorts of beings,
minerals, gods, trees, animals, and men, while the goddess, his companion, by
the seduction of her more graceful dance—the lasya—causes female beings to
appear.
YANTRAS AND RAGAS
Each species of living being, just like each mineral substance, comes forth from
a code, a formula that becomes more and more complex as the varied forms of
nature develop. To begin with, such formulas are simple, facilitating the

classification of relationships among various forms of existence. There are
analogies between certain subtle beings and minerals, plants, animals, and
human types.
These simple formulas, sources of life and creation, are not merely abstract
entities but active principles. At the origin of each line, we can conceive of an
active genetic principle, a manifestation of divine thought in creation, a spirit or
deity. These principles can be translated into various images, such as
anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or vegetal representations.
Shaivite cosmology seeks to summarize nature in the form of geometric
diagrams, codes of proportions linked to certain key numbers. Such diagrams are
called yantras. When Einstein suggested that, “in the universe, all is geometry,”
he was enunciating a principle that Indian cosmology has always held.
The system of the yantras, the magical diagrams evoking certain component
principles of the universe, also allows us to establish some kind of
communication with active powers—the gods they represent—rather like a
telephone number putting us into contact with an invisible responder. The
numerical-geometric elements evoking active subtle entities at all levels of
existence are also found in the microcosm, in the human being, and we can
analyze the emotional impact they have on the individual consciousness, since
the raison d’être of our perceptions is to make us witnesses of the divine work. A
world that is not perceived does not exist. Our senses are the mirrors through
which the Creator’s dream becomes reality.
YANTRA ELEMENTS
In static form, the yantras express the basic principles encountered at all levels of
existence, life, perception, and thought. With their help we can, in some cases,
discover how our emotive perceptions correspond to certain basic geometric and
numerical factors, and on this basis an aesthetic theory can be established.
Some of the geometric elements utilized in the yantras are:
The fire triangle, pointing upward, which evokes the principle of expansion
—ascendant and centrifugal—considered as male, whose equivalent is the
phallus symbol. Fire tends to rise, to move outward from the terrestrial
center of attraction. It symbolizes detachment, the mystic approach,
tension, development, inequality.
The water triangle, pointing downward, evokes the principle of attraction—
centripetal—considered as female. Water tends to find a horizontal

equilibrium, to level out, and the water triangle represents attachment, the
religious approach, appeasement.
In the symbolism of numbers, the fire triangle corresponds to the factors 3
(triangle) over 2 (base), while the water triangle corresponds to the factors 2/3.
In music, the 3/2 ratio of the fire triangle corresponds to the frequency ratio of
what we call “a fifth” (Do/So), an interval that to us appears as radiant, active,
and glorious, whereas the 2/3 ratio of the water triangle corresponds to what is
called “a fourth” (Do/Fa), which is a soft, passive, feminine interval. In music,
multiples of the factor 2, which is neuter, correspond to differences of an octave
and do not change the significance of the ratios.
When the male and female triangles touch, a spark occurs and the energy
principle appears. This is represented by the figure symbolized by the
“hourglass” shaped drum of the god Shiva.
When the triangles interpenetrate, creation takes place. The appearance of
matter is due to the principle of gravitation, which gives birth to atoms and solar
systems. It is represented by the star hexagon, which in music corresponds to
movement, the series of fifths and fourths, giving rise to two basic hexagonal
scales:
C, D 9/8 = 22/23, E + 81/64 = 34/26, G 3/2, A + 27/16 = 33/24, B + 243/128 =
35/27
C, B flat 8/9 = 23/32, A flat 64/81 = 26/34, F 2/3, E flat 16/27 = 24/33, D flat
128/243 = 27/35
Together, they form the twelve basic sound divisions of the octave used in all
music. There is nothing arbitrary in this division. It merely indicates our aptitude
to recognize certain numerical ratios directly by listening, just as we perceive
visual ones.
The three basic elements of the world structure are called tamas (centrifugal
force), sattva (centripetal force), and rajas (their resultant, which gives rise to
gravitation, vibration, and rhythm). In one form or other, they are found at the
basis of every aspect of the world. These three factors have been compared to a
car battery or the connection between a positive (tamas) and negative (sattva)
pole that produces energy (rajas), which makes the starter work.
In religious symbolism, these three principles are represented by an
indivisible trinity, the source of the formation of worlds, with the aspect of the
three gods: Shiva (tamas), Vishnu (sattva), and Brahma (rajas). Brahma is the
craftsman, the artisan of the universe. Everywhere we find the star hexagon and

the circle, born from its movement.
THE FACTOR OF LIFE
The formation of vibratory waves or rotation waves causes the appearance of a
coordinate of space, which is time. A sound wave represents a given number of
vibrations during a period of time. Time in itself, however, knows no absolute
measurement, any more than space does. They merely represent relative values.
The dimensions of space and time exist only in relation to a perception, to a
consciousness connected to what we call life. A universe is not in itself any
larger than an atom. Dimensions appear large or small in relation to the rhythm
that serves as the basis of our perceptions.
According to Hindu cosmology, a form of consciousness or perception is
present everywhere in the universe, in molecules, solar systems, and galaxies. It
is manifest in the order of creation by the appearance of a new factor, the
numerical factor 5, in the structure of molecules, star cells, and living beings.
Our perception of the dimension of space and time depends on the factor 5.
Since life, feeling, and perception began, they have been linked to combinations
of molecules in which the factor 5 plays an essential role. An ice crystal forming
on a windowpane has six branches, but it is not alive. A starfish has ten: it lives,
perceives, and acts.
The leaves of trees have five follicles, just as our hand has five fingers. We
possess five senses. All structures of life and perception are linked to this magic
factor, which is represented in the yantra system by the star pentagon, symbol of
the god Shiva as the source of life, knowledge, and perception. In iconography,
it is also evoked by the moon of the fifth day. This symbol is encountered in all
religions.
The properties of the pentagon give life and emotion to architectural forms,
hence the importance of the golden segment in the architecture of our ancient
cathedrals. The golden segment is the ratio of the length of a diagonal drawn
between two nonadjacent points of a pentagon and the length of a side. It
corresponds approximately to the ratio of 1:1.62.
Even in our own times, an old Italian mason whom I asked to widen a
window replied, “I can’t do it, because it wouldn’t be tall enough.” A window
that is one meter wide should be 1.62 meters tall, meaning the ratio of the golden
segment. It is owing to the observance of these proportions that ancient Italian
hovels have such an apparently inexplicable charm. It is the utilization of the
golden number that lends harmony to Greek temples, and a mysterious charm to

ancient cathedrals.
THE FACTOR 5 IN MUSIC
Music plays a major role in understanding the basic principles encountered at all
levels of existence, life, perception, and thought—as the Greeks, following the
Indians, remarked—since in music we can analyze the connection between
frequency ratios, between sound waves and emotive factors. Musical modes
make it possible to analyze our emotional mechanisms, and their relation with
the numerical factors that determine them, just as they determine all our
aesthetic perceptions. This is why music is considered as a kind of key to the arts
and sciences.
Indian music has hundreds of modes, or ragas, that awaken the most diverse
feelings. The word raga means “what moves, charms, pleases, attracts.” Some
sound ratios sound gay to us, while others stir up melancholy; trumpets make us
think of war, and chants make us mystical. Even in such a rudimentary and
artificial system as that of Western music, we feel the difference in the emotional
climate of major and minor modes.
The intervals we find moving, sad, or tender, violent or aggressive,
correspond to the factor 5. It is much easier to analyze them in modal music,
built around a relation to a fixed tone, the tonic, as in Indian, Arabic, and ancient
Greek music, rather than in Western music, which uses modulation (constant
changes of the tonic) and in which the scale is distorted by the tempering of
fixed-tone instruments like the piano.
Intervals can, however, be observed in expressive moments when voice,
chords, and breathing abandon the tempered system. When an inspired
performer suddenly plays a B flat that grips us and makes us shiver with
emotion, he is using the same sound ratios as an Indian musician.
The main intervals featuring the factor 5 form two sets parallel to those of
the triple system, the cycle of fifths. They are:
A 5/3, E 5/4 = 5/22, B 15/8 = 5 x 3/23, F sharp 45/32 = 5 x 32/25, D flat
135/128 = 5 x 33/27
B flat + 9/5 = 32/5, E flat + 6/5 = 3 x 2/5, A flat + 8/5 = 23/5, D flat + 16/15 =
24/5 x 3, F sharp + 64/45 = 26/5 x 32, B + 256/135 = 28/5 x 33.
The notes of the first set evoke feelings of sweetness, tenderness, calmness,
melancholy. Those of the second are hard, enterprising, aggressive.

By uniting all these intervals, we obtain an irregular division of the octave
into twenty-four intervals (in practice twenty-two), giving different nuances of
expression for certain notes that the Indians call shruti (“what the ear
distinguishes clearly”), since they form our total musical vocabulary.
Theoreticians of Indian music have carefully studied the psychological
impact of these various intervals, thus making it possible—by combining them
in different scales—to create the emotional climates of ragas. A parallel system
exists for the color spectrum, the visible part of which corresponds to a musical
octave, going from simple to double frequencies. These observations, together
with those deriving from the yantras’geometric diagrams, have led to a general
theory of aesthetics, that is, a code of proportions giving a coherent definition of
what we call beauty, which is produced by a multitude of precise harmonies.
There are hundreds of ragas, just as there are hundreds of types of beauty.
It is on these bases that canons have been established, definitions of
proportion that are used as the basis for Indian sculpture.1 Codes of proportions
defining different kinds of beauty follow different canons. These canons cover
all details, not only the proportions of the body, but of the face, the spacing of
the eyes, the relative length of legs and arms, determining proportions that
correspond to beneficent or maleficent beings, erotic or heroic.
Beauty is made of harmony, ugliness of discord. In both animals and
humankind, genetic selection tends to establish the perfection of each type,
explaining why a pedigree dog is beautiful and a mongrel is not. Each species of
living being is born of a harmony, a code. Left to itself, nature improves and
perfects each type, leading to extraordinary beauty in insects, flowers, animals,
and humans. The principle of harmony and beauty is thus both the origin and
outcome of creation, the raison d’être of existence. It is through harmony that we
can apprehend something of the secret nature of the world and of the divine.

Music: The Language
of the Gods
n Shaivite philosophy, as also in Pythagorean theory, music is considered as a
kind of key to the sciences, as well as a means of communication between
different states of being, between the human and the supernatural. It is the
language of the gods. This is no arbitrary attribution, any more than is—to the
popular mind—the representation of the world as being created by the rhythm of
Shiva’s drum. For Hindu cosmology, matter as such does not exist. The universe
is formed only by relations of energy elements, tensions, vibrations, and
movements.
Even the dimension of time only exists in relation to wavelengths, vibratory
rhythms whose duration we perceive through a kind of clock within ourselves,
which is nowadays termed the brain’s alpha rhythm. The appearance of the
world is due to the limitations of our senses. It would appear completely
different to beings possessing other senses operating within other limits.
The phenomena of life, feeling, perception, consciousness, and thought all
derive from the same formulas that are the basis for the formation of matter. This
is why communication is possible.
There is thus a fundamental bond, or coordination, between matter and
perception, which exist only for each other and through each other. Rare are the
domains where parallelism—the linkage between the physical, mental, sensorial,
and emotional—is easily discernible and can be traced back to comparable data
or common formulas. Music is the most obvious example. The ratios of sound
vibrations, which can be reduced to simple numerical ratios, are perceived as
emotive stimulants, as means of psychological manipulation. They evoke
images, create an aesthetic feeling, an emotion, establish a kind of
communication between spheres that seem to be totally different, and even
between different forms of being.
Thanks to this ubiquity, sounds, organized in a musical (nada) or verbal
(shabda) form, can guide us in seeking those formulas of a more general kind

that lie at the very foundation of creation as a whole, at the origin of all forms of
matter and life. It is by utilizing these formulas in a rhythmic form that Shiva
dances creation, thus giving birth to different forms of being. By virtue of the
existence of these archetypes, of these formulas common to all aspects of
creation, music allows us to evoke one order of existence within another, to
communicate with spirits and gods.
MODERN WESTERN MUSIC
The mechanisms of our perceptions are of a proportional nature. They are not
connected to dimension: A square is a square, whether it is large or small. All
aesthetics are based on proportions, and the same is true of music. This is why
the tempered piano, which claims to replace a proportional system with an
additive system, by equalizing—that is, mutilating—the intervals, by replacing
harmonic ratios with a division based on logarithms, is an aesthetic and
psychological aberration.
This system has singularly oriented the development of Western music for
more than two centuries and has made it very difficult to study the musical
phenomenon as a whole. For example, studying various kinds of Oriental or
ethnic music while utilizing as a system of measurement the hundredths of
tempered semitones is aberrant, since it completely masks the proportional ratios
that are the basis of all music and alone make it possible to explain its magical
action.
The modification—or let us say sterilization—of intervals in the tempered
scale deprives most Western music of its cosmic and psychological
correspondence. Its logical result is a musically neutral structure, without any
defined center, leading music to abstract forms stripped of any meaning or
emotive impact. Such music is far from any universal reality and its only
attraction lies in the extent to which it betrays its own principles, where
something real can be glimpsed through its approximations. Xenakis’s wife said
of him one day, “Despite his theories, Yannis is a musician all the same.” Such a
remark could easily apply to the most important modern composers.
FACTORS 2, 3, AND 5
The real substance of music—sound material formed by a set of sounds
utilizable and utilized in all music—is founded on harmonic progressions using
the factors 2, 3, and 5 as a basis. If we study the basic structures of matter and

the principles of life, we find the same numerical factors as in music. This is
precisely why one can have an impact on the other.
From the point of view of human perception, the discernible intervals taken
as a whole and having a precise significance within an octave (including the base
sound and its octave) number fifty-four, sounds deriving from different
combinations of the factors 2, 3, and 5 within certain limitations. These fifty-
four sounds form the vocabulary of all music.
Hindu semanticists, such as Nandikeshvara and Bhartrihari, explain that the
other form of sound language—spoken language—is also formed of fifty-four
possibilities of articulation, which we call vowels and consonants, serving as the
basis of all the world’s languages. Any expression, any communication through
the intermediary of sound, employs these 108 elements that are a constant in our
perceptive mechanisms, our powers of mental classification, of cognition. This is
why the figure 108, representing the sum of fifty-four musical sounds and fifty-
four articulated sounds, is deemed sacred, as a symbol of the Creator-Word.
THE ACTIONS OF RHYTHMIC DIVISIONS
Rhythmic divisions and their psychophysiological action are based on factors
similar to harmonic divisions. There is no difference in the nature of what we
perceive as the pitch of a sound or its rhythms. Below sixteen vibrations per
second, we perceive sound frequencies as beats. We are capable of coordinating
these beats in rhythmic frames corresponding to harmonic frames.
Psychophysiological reactions are the same.
Measures in 2, 4, 8, or 16 beat cycle form the framework of rhythmic
developments and correspond to the octaves of the melodic scale. Rhythmic
elements in 3 beat cycle create movement. Rhythms in 5 beat cycle cause
emotive reactions and are consequently much employed in music intended to
produce a psychological effect, as well as in ceremonies and dances of an
ecstatic or magical nature.
In forms of music producing a psychological or cosmological action,
extreme precision is required in the intervals and rhythms for them to be
effective. Additional processes, however, such as differences in volume, touch,
color, or metric or rhythmic nuances, can sometimes make up for any deficiency
in pitch ratios, as in the case of piano music or the music of Indonesian
gamelans. At the same time, rhythmic inaccuracy eliminates most of the music’s
physiological impact, so that it no longer induces an ecstatic condition, and no
longer serves as a means of communication with the supernatural.

THREE ASPECTS OF MUSIC
For human beings, music has three main aspects: a ritual or magical aspect, a
cosmological aspect, and a psychological aspect. These three aspects are
sometimes mixed together and confused, whereas basically they are
fundamentally distinct.
Magical Aspects
The purpose of what may be termed ritual or magical music is to establish
communication with the invisible, with the transcendent forces that govern the
world, with cosmic principles, the mysterious world of gods and spirits. Such
forms of music are the basis of any ecstatic rite, any magical practice. There is
no rite that does not involve some sound element.
Although in actual fact all music constructed according to the natural laws of
acoustics and hearing possesses magical potential and ritual aspects, some sound
forms serve solely for communication with the invisible.
Thanks to the parallelisms between certain musical formulas and those on
which the structures of matter and life are based, it is possible to evoke the subtle
beings, which we call spirits and gods, and let them manifest themselves and act.
Ecstatic dances are a means of establishing contacts with supernatural forces that
can then express themselves through the mouth of the dancer, who appears to be
possessed by a spirit. This is what happens in possession dances and in ancient
practices of a Dionysian kind, which can still be observed easily in the zikhr of
the Middle East and the dances of African witch doctors. Such dances utilize
repetitive rhythmic formulas that create a state of semiconsciousness. Sudden
breaks in the rhythm then cause a psychological shock leading to a state of
trance in which the dancer’s personality dissolves and becomes permeable to
external influences that become incarnate in him or her.
Curiously enough, in the modern West, music with certain features close to
those of ecstatic music is no longer found in places of worship, but in quite
different places like discos, where dancers experience the kind of hypnotic
isolation that is needed for mystical experience, which—if it were properly
directed—could lead to the perception of supersensory realities. The gods are
much closer in the exaltation of rock concerts than in the faded canticles of the
churches with their well-disciplined chorales, just as vagabond hippies are much
closer to the mystical wanderers, the “crazies of god,” than frustrated monks
snug in their rich monasteries.

Sound levels also play an important role in the effectiveness of hypnotic rites
and communication with invisible worlds. Some sound forms of a ritual nature
are not meant to be pleasant to the human ear. The “thunderous din” of a ritual
nature plays a major role in evoking subtle beings, whether it is the sarva
vadyam of Indian temples, in which all the instruments are played together, or
the din of bells with their strange harmonics, which make people go crazy if they
are too close, or yet again the racket of drums in African rites, or of the striking
of wooden battens in Buddhist temples or in the monasteries of Mount Athos.
The jumble of organ harmonics beneath cathedral vaults often leads to a similar
result, creating a tissue of sound that is quite independent of the piece played,
through which subtle forces can materialize.
Some forms of religious music do not at all aim at making the gods descend
to humankind but merely raise human beings toward the divine, and are in effect
forms of melodic meditation. This is the case of music with a mystic character,
which remains bound to the spoken word, like the bhajanas, those wonderful
sung poems evoking divine love and the legends of the gods, whose emotive
nature is related to that of secular song.
There are also other forms of solemn music of a secular kind, employed to
emphasize ceremonial grandeur. Our masses for full orchestra provide an
example and have parallels in all civilizations.
Cosmological Aspects
The second aspect of music is of a cosmological order and has a social character.
Such music evokes the structures of the natural world, the cycle of the seasons,
the movements of the stars, and seeks to control their impact on human society.
Some musical systems attach great importance to this kind of musical influence
on social atmosphere.
According to Chinese theory the precision of scales and pitch of the tuning
fork influence the balance of society and the prosperity of the country. Such
music does not seek to have any psychological impact. It is generally pentatonic
in character and denotes movement or energy but only becomes sensitive when it
deviates a little from the system. Sounding pipes, used as standards—the lyu
—were once upon a time carefully preserved in the imperial palace so as to avoid
any deviation in the tuning of orchestras, which could have caused disorders,
famine, and social conflict.
In the Middle East, the cosmic dances of the Zoroastrians—of which dervish
dances are a survival—have the aim of creating an astrologically favorable

atmosphere to facilitate the integration of humans with the cosmos. China, India,
and the Amerindian civilizations also practiced such ceremonies of an
astrological nature.
Owing to its mathematical aspects, music with a cosmological character is
related to the yantras, those symbolic diagrams, which also find their application
in the interplay of numbers and the proportions that are the basis of the plastic
arts. In particular, cosmological music is closely related to the diagrams used as
the basis for sacred architecture. The structures of temples, cathedrals, and the
homes we live in—their orientation, the positioning of their doors and windows,
their proportions and colors—create an environment that has a subtle influence
on us. The atmosphere of a cathedral is not a chance effect. On the other hand,
the new Vatican audience hall has no more spiritual atmosphere than a garage or
a cinema.
The same is valid for the seat of state power. The orientation and proportions
of public buildings have an impact on the behavior and attitude of those in them,
who have to take serious and consequential decisions. The fact that the French
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are oriented toward the north is not very
conducive to the wisdom of the laws promulgated there, since the buildings have
not been properly oriented according to the cosmic order.
Much contemporary music tends toward architectural forms, but by
neglecting certain fundamental aspects of the significance of sound ratios, it can
have a deleterious effect on our balance, on our truthfulness. As with most
current social or ethical concepts, these more or less logical developments are
based on erroneous postulates and orientations.
What we call modern music can only regain a beneficial role and a human
value if it changes not so much its structures as its bases, which—all too often
from a cosmological point of view—have to be considered as demoniac,
contributing to the moral disorder of our times.
Some forms of musical art, while belonging to the cosmological concept in
which the structural element is predominant, have only a weak psychological
impact. Some of Bach’s works fall into this category.
Psychological Aspects
Music’s third aspect is of a psychological nature and concerns the impact of
organized sounds on the emotive mechanisms of human beings. Such music can
move us to the bottom of our soul, melt our hearts, exalt us. The music of the
Middle East, which derives from Greek music, and the music of India’s ragas is

constructed on the basis of correspondence of harmonic and psychological
factors. Crowd-pleasing martial music belongs to the same family, as also the
utilization of sound forms for medical and psychological purposes: music
therapy.
From the point of view of psychological impact, the most effective syntax
(manner of organizing sounds) is modal. This system predominates in the
Middle East and in India, but it was also the basis of the music of the
Mediterranean world up to a relatively recent period. This system divides the
octave into twelve areas containing the fifty-four sounds that have psychological
repercussions, in the form of expressive nuances.
The major peculiarity of the modal system, from the psychological point of
view, is its fixed base tone, known as the tonic. This sound, maintained
throughout the performance of any mode, means that all the notes chosen for the
scale also have a constant pitch, and always correspond to the same frequencies.
If a given interval, say a minor third for example, is felt to be associated with a
given feeling—such as tenderness or sadness—this feeling will always be
represented by the same sound and will be made increasingly acute by repetition.
In India, musical modes are called “ragas,” or “states of mind.” A raga can
also be defined as a theoretical scale, as a set of proportional intervals, or as a
complex of sounds, each of which has a psychological impact or precise
significance. Taken as a whole, they create an emotive atmosphere or state of
mind.
Indian psychology envisages nine different sorts of mood or affective states,
which are called rasas, “flavors.” They are thus linked to numerical factors,
giving us an interesting glimpse into the workings of the brain’s mechanisms and
the nature of our aesthetic and emotional reactions. The emotive atmosphere of
the ragas is often associated with those that prevail at different times of day and
night, or else of the seasons that punctuate the year’s cycle. Like the vegetal
world, we react differently in the morning or the evening, in the spring or
autumn.
Modal music can only be improvised, since preset forms of melody
adversely affect modal consciousness, its internal vision centered on the scale of
the mode and the atmosphere it creates. The musician should therefore cruise
freely in the inner ambiance created by the mood without ever coming out of it.
It is a very intense and a very extraordinary experience, which requires total
abstraction from the outer world. In fact, it is a form of meditation that can easily
become mystical in character.
The listener is also gradually influenced by the nature of the mode, becoming
immersed in a sort of sound bath, which evokes a well-defined feeling. The

listener gradually identifies with the emotional scenario evoked. This is why a
good performance of modal music can have a profound effect on the audience,
making them melancholic, wary, calm, enterprising, aggressive, or tender,
according to the atmosphere created by the performer.
In actual fact, any music that seeks to move us—such as what we know as
romantic music—requires us to abandon ourselves to the feeling evoked, which
takes precedence over technical format. That is why Greek warriors were
advised not to listen to certain modes, which stimulate a kind of erotic languor.
The Dorian mode was recommended, since it stimulates courage and energy.
During the Middle Ages, modes deemed to be sensual were forbidden by the
church, always sexophobic, not to speak of the augmented fourth, which does in
fact open horizons onto the invisible, and was considered to be diabolical, the
diabolus in musica.
If we wish to listen to modal music of the Indian kind, we must change our
habits a little, and give up any kind of analytical or critical spirit. We must get
used to being penetrated, lulled, imbued by the sounds, lose all notion of time,
abandon ourselves without reticence to the magical climate that will gradually
engulf us. As in yoga meditation, we must silence the useless agitations of our
mind. We shall then see gradually opening in front of us an unknown and
marvelous musical landscape. This experience is not so very different from those
caused by certain drugs but is much richer and susceptible of infinite variety.
Music can then become for us a school of wisdom and key to true knowledge, a
means of communicating with the invisible, with that mysterious world of genies
and gods.

T
The Secret of the Tantras
he double reality of the physical body and the subtle body merely expresses
a particular aspect of cosmological reality. The basic structures of the
universe and of the terrestrial world, like those of the human body, have a
double aspect, the apparent (matter) and the real (subtle). The earth belongs to
the solar system. Nothing can exist on earth that does not, on principle, exist in
the solar world. Thus, there must be a solar consciousness, a solar intelligence, a
solar life, or else where would these components in human beings have come
from?
The solar world and terrestrial world must thus be represented in the same
way as in the subtle person. In both cases, we shall encounter centers of energy,
critical points at which are located the energies that determine life,
consciousness, duration, physical or subtle perceptions of the earth as well as of
human beings, and the transcendent powers that we call gods, who are manifest
there.
This explains why certain places are sacred, certain regions privileged, a fact
that has an impact on the characteristics of the human beings who live in such
places. In the same way, certain areas of the human body are the seat of
particular faculties. Sacred geography is superadded to the inner geography of
the world and human beings. They are complementary, and in no way
contradictory.
Any attempt at communication between states or levels of different beings,
between humans, gods, and spirits of all kinds that our rudimentary senses
cannot perceive, requires knowledge of the world’s subtle structures, which
allows us to discover the openings, the secret passages through which we can
communicate with other forms of being, other dimensions of space, time, and
matter.
The search for this fundamental data that lies at the root of every aspect of
the visible and invisible, inert or living worlds is the only true science. It
simultaneously implies both faultless logic and unprejudiced intuition. On the
one hand, it includes supramental perception cultivated by the introspective

methods of Yoga, allowing us to reactivate our nonmental knowledge potential,
and on the other an attentive observation of the signs, the parallel elements that
we can discern in the most varied forms of manifestation, through which we can
distinguish certain constants. In Hindu philosophy, this latter approach—which
we may term cosmological—bears the name of Samkhya (numerable), “the
observation of constants,” and is considered to be the indispensable complement
of Yoga (union)—supramental perception, whose observations it controls and
explains.
Once certain keys indicated by the constants and basic structural elements
have been determined, we can utilize the fundamental energies that are the very
basis of life to try to establish communication between the various states of
being—the gods, spirits, the dead—beings that are not usually perceptible in the
dimension that determines the barriers of our senses and the limits of apparent
relative time, which depends on our perception of duration. This communication
is established with the aid of three practical and interdependent methods called:
mantras (magical formulas)
yantras (magical diagrams)
tantras (magical gestures or acts)
These three elements of the communication system between worlds are
closely linked to one another and are inseparable in action. Such methods of
magical action may appear absurd and irrational from the point of view of our
habitual logic, but they are based on absolute realities, which only the most
abstract aspects of modern science are occasionally beginning to point out for us.
The universe is divine thought, perceived as an apparent reality, but what is
thought if not a ratio of forces? There is no thought without existence, no
existence without a material support. Thought-matter-life form an indissoluble
triangle. The language we use to try to grasp and communicate our thought
approximately is made up of a very limited number of symbolic elements,
formed by around fifty articulated sounds, which we do our best to combine to
give our ideas an approximate delimitation. Mantras pick up these basic
elements, and yantras allow us to establish the corresponding geometric
diagrams.
For any given world to exist, the conditions that make it possible must first
exist. The first stage in any world is thus potential (avakasha). For the spatial
world, such potential depends on the existence of space, which is one of the
properties of a subtle element called ether (akasha).
Space, however, has no dimension except in relation to an element of

measurement, a vibration, a given wavelength. In humans, this vibration is called
the “alpha” rhythm of the brain, which determines the duration, or dimension of
time (kala).
For beings existing on a wavelength that is very different from our own, a
second of their time may correspond to a thousand years of ours. Or, on the
contrary, a second of our time may last centuries for them. In both cases, they
can only be perceptible to us if we can escape from duration, from the
limitations of our perception of time.
Vibration is a form of energy. The world’s substance can always be reduced
to ratios of energy elements. Energy is the tension that exists between two
opposing forces. In the spatial world, these two forces appear as a concentrating
centripetal force that gives rise to energy coagulations, such as stars or atoms,
and a dispersive centrifugal force that tends to dissolve and break up, to disperse
and destroy a world in perpetual expansion.
Centripetal force corresponds to the protector principle called Vishnu, while
the centrifugal force of the destroyer principle is called Shiva. It is this latter
principle that triumphs in an atomic explosion. The movement of stars and atoms
is the resultant balance of these two tendencies. This resultant is called Brahma
(size) in its cosmological aspect, or Shakti (energy) in its energy aspect. These
principles are found in an indefinite number of increasingly complex forms in all
things. They are expressed by three tendencies: sattva, the constructive or
ascendant tendency (Vishnu); tamas, the destructive or descending tendency
(Shiva); and rajas, the tendency of orbital movement and action (Brahma).
Each tendency recreates the contrast of opposites, considered as being male
(Shiva) and female (Shakti-Vishnu). Each material element, each being or god,
is again divided into an equilibrium of opposites. Every principle and every god
is thus represented with a counterpart or goddess.
Among the cosmological factors that characterize opposites, we may observe
that at the basis of what we term male we find an “odd” factor, and at the basis
of whatever we call female an “even” factor. This is starting to appear in modern
genetics.
The basic elements required for the formation of atoms, life, and thought
could be symbolized by verbal (vibratory) formulas or structural (geometric)
formulas. From a verbal point of view, we say that the Creator utters the
universe: creation by the Word. Since vibration is assimilated to sound, a world
where all is vibration can be represented by sound ratios, mantras, or “magic
formulas.” At the same time, creation can be envisaged as a structure, that is,
ratios of forces that can be expressed by numbers or symbolized as diagrams, the
yantras, or “magic figures.”

At the level of life, creation may be represented by the sexual act, as well as
by symbolic gestures, the mudras. The magical aspect of ritual acts is called
tantra.
Mantras, 
yantras, 
and 
tantras 
are 
interdependent. 
Through 
them
communication is possible between the different levels of existence. They are at
the basis of all religion, any approach to the real and the supernatural. Here there
is no hiatus between physics and metaphysics, material and subtle, psychology
and parapsychology.
Yantras are diagrams representing the inner structure of things, those basic
formulas of creation that are found in all aspects of the world and, from one level
of existence, allow us to communicate with another, from mineral to vegetable,
to animal, to human, to the suprasensory (spirits and genies), to the supernatural
(the gods), to the transcendent (the Absolute). They are linked to sound formulas
(mantras) that are indicated by symbolic letters. They are the basis for any
communication with the invisible, for all magic rites or tantras, for all temple
architecture, or any anthropomorphic representation of the gods.
TANTRIC MANTRAS
Tantric mantras comprise a single syllable corresponding to the symbolic
elements of articulation.
The mantra that corresponds to the fire triangle is the syllable AUM, which
contains the entire articulated language, since it is formed of the guttural “A,”
the labial “U” and the cerebral “M.” All other possibilities of articulation are
found within this triangle.
Besides the syllable AUM, which is of a universal nature, Tantric mantras all
present certain common sound features. They may be grouped together in
complex formulas or embodied in linguistic expressions, since by themselves
they never form “words” of the ordinary language. Mantras corresponding to
certain energy aspects represented by yantras are indicated by syllabic
characters. Indeed, no yantra is complete, nor can it be employed for magical
purposes, unless it is accompanied by its corresponding mantras and appropriate
mudras, symbolic acts or gestures. The sign of the cross is a mudra representing
the primacy of the male element (vertical) over the female element (horizontal),
the primacy of the fire that mounts and rises to heaven over the water that tends
toward leveling out, equalization, and inaction.
The main elements in Tantric mantras are the following:

LANG, the basic seed (dhara bija)
VANG, the seed of the lord of the waters (Varuna bija)
RANG, the seed of fire (vahni bija)
YANG, the seed of the wind (vayu bija)
HANG, the seed of ether (akasha bija)
KLING, the seed of desire (kama bija)
KRING, the seed of death (kali bija)
SHRING, the seed of fortune (Lakshmi bija)
HRING, the primordial power (mula mantra)
PHAT, mantra of the sword that separates the subtle from the gross
HUNG, the offering
These mantra elements are combined with words that have an esoteric
meaning to create more or less complex magical formulas. They include
expressions such as aham sah (I am That), the mantra identifying the microcosm
with the macrocosm, which we unconsciously pronounce with every breath.
Tantrism moreover utilizes ordinary words, giving them a particular
symbolic meaning. The ritual texts and formulas of Tantrism cannot therefore be
understood or utilized without possessing the key. For example:
bindu (the “limit point” separating the nonmanifest from the manifest) means
“sperm”
vajra (lightning) means “the male organ”
mudra (the gesture) means “vaginal secretions”
padma (the lotus) means “the woman.”
Mudras are gestures, movements, contractions, or postures of the body that
make it possible to reach certain limit points within the human structure that can
be used as openings, passages from one order of existence to another. They are
the key to our possibilities of communicating with the suprasensory or
extrasensory world.
Some gestures are purely physical and correspond to mantras (sound
symbols), or yantras (geometric symbols), but Yoga mudras are more complex,
allowing us to force the secret doors concealed within the human structure,
through which we can communicate with other worlds.
The main mudras defined by Yoga treatises number twenty-five and their
utilization is essential for any magical or Tantric realization.
THE SUBTLE STRUCTURES OF HUMAN BEINGS

Human beings are the culmination, the raison d’être of creation. They are robots
of prodigious complexity, which—through an autonomous consciousness—in
some way perceive the Creators’work from outside, thus giving it reality, since a
creation that is not perceived, that has no witnesses, does not exist.
Each divine dream, each picture conceived by the Creator needs a spectator
to witness its reality. For this particular world, we are the witnesses. The
limitations of our perceptions lend an apparent truth to an illusory universe,
since what we perceive as objects are, in actual fact, merely conglomerations of
atoms, centers of pure energy evolving in abysses of infinitesimal emptiness.
The human robot is a complex mechanism whose energy centers develop
into living cells, vital energies, sensory potential, mechanisms of autonomous
thought, and consciousness. If we strip down this mechanism, discover and study
the various workshops that together constitute a living being, we reach the very
sources of existence, of life and consciousness, and we can eventually utilize
their latent potentials, which—at a certain level—are practically limitless.
Exploring these secret potentials requires a very strict method involving the
coordination of physical, vital, and mental elements. This method is called Yoga
and it allows us to explore ourselves and analyze the nature of the various
centers that process our faculties, our substance, our modes of perception, our
vital energies, and our genetic code.
In the human body, the centers of consciousness—its faculties and various
powers, examined during the course of Yoga introspection—appear as yantras.
The centers in which our various energies are located are called chakras
(wheels) or padmas (lotuses). By becoming familiar with the structure of the
various chakras and exploring their various mechanisms, we can develop our
latent faculties and powers. The chakras of the subtle body are the basic
structures of the human being. The form of the physical body is merely a gross
covering, while the senses, owing to their narrow limitations, are actually
barriers to any true perception of the real.
Yantras are not arbitrary symbols. They are the most precise representation
of creation’s basic structures, at the level of matter, or at the level of life and
thought. They explain the process through which the Creator fashions the world.
They are the blueprints of the universe and of humankind. Exploring some of
them by introspection in the chakras of the subtle body allows us to control all
our centers of life and thought, to develop real powers and faculties, to control
and utilize all our latent forces and to act on ourselves and on the world around
us, to practice levitation, change the duration of time, to see the past and future,
to go to any terrestrial or superterrestrial location, to leave this dimension and

see the structure of atoms or of solar systems. The definitions of Hindu science
concerning the structure of atoms or solar systems are based on such
observations.
At the base of yantra structure, we find certain symbolic elements that have a
universal value, such as the fire triangle, the water triangle, and the star
pentagon, the crescent moon of the fifth day. We also encounter:
The star hexagon, which represents union, creative power, pleasure,
perfection, universality, space, the orbital tendency (rajas), creation,
movement.
The square, which represents the earth. All terrestrial life is governed by the
number 4: seasons, castes, the ages of life, the directions of space, the
dwellings of humankind.
The circle, which symbolizes the worlds. Each universe contained in another
is represented by a circle. The small inner circle represents the emptiness
that is inside and outside all things.
CHAKRAS
Any living being is formed of two intermixing and apparently conflicting
structures: On the one hand, a physical body with a mental component
culminating in the brain, logical thought, and communication, and, on the other,
a subtle energy body controlling all our vital energies, which is responsible for
our intuitive perception. This secret body escapes the control of our mental
faculties and is our true being. It is inserted in our visible being and is inverse to
it. Its central point is at the base of the spine in the region of our sexual organs,
which is the noble, essential part of our being. By a great effort of introspection,
after reducing to silence the incessant chattering of our mental apparatus, we can
gradually explore this secret part of ourselves. One after the other, we discover
the functional centers of this vital being who dwells in our visible body. These
centers are called chakras (wheels) and are in actual fact the systems that operate
our vital mechanisms and open for us the access to the sources of life, true
knowledge, to the universes that surround us together with their inhabitants, the
gods, genies, fairies, spirits, demons, the whole subtle world that teems around
us and that we can only perceive by this means.
During this inner journey, the chakras appear to us as yantras, the diagrams
associated with mantras, or sound formulas. They correspond to what we may
term magical powers, since they are beyond the capacity of our visible body.

This is the very basis of tantras, or magical acts. In the chakras, we also find the
different degrees of transcendent powers that we call gods.
Descriptions of the chakras provided by the inner experience of yogis show
certain constants, as well as—quite often—gaps and even slight differences,
deriving from the degree of precision with which the yogi describes the inner
journey.
Chakras are represented as open lotus flowers, their “petals” being oriented
regions in which certain powers or faculties are centralized. During a yogi’s
inner journey, it is—by way of example—by penetrating the second bottom left
petal of the third chakra that the yogi discovers the power of levitation.
One Tantric Yoga manuscript describing the chakras starts (reading upward
from the bottom) with a list of 135 fundamental principles, which—according to
Hindu cosmological concepts—form the basis of the structures of the universe.
The list begins with the conscious being, perception, inaction, name, form,
reality, consciousness, enjoyment, totality, the abstract, the beginning, growth,
decline, causality, destruction, and so on and ends with localization, support,
emptiness, vacuum, and universality. It passes through the five senses, the five
elements, the notions of consciousness, individuality, life, different vital
energies, and so on.
Then comes a list of the seven worlds, each with its three divisions: heavenly
worlds, infernal worlds, and worlds of the living. This is followed by
descriptions of the various levels of the particular creation on which human
existence lies.
First is a primordial energy called the power of the frog (darduri). By
meditating on the frog, we acquire the power of conveying ourselves instantly to
any point of space. There follows the principle of time, the destroyer, bearing a
red standard and a lotus flower. Then Shiva appears in his causal aspect, armed
with a trident, followed by the principle of protective energy, bearing the
attributes of Vishnu.
From the word and mind of the primordial being came forth the tortoise, on
which the world rests. The tortoise—showing itself openly or withdrawing into
its shell—is the symbol of the limit point at which manifestation appears openly
or vanishes, closed up within itself. Next the lower world develops, peopled with
mythical beings called snakes. Higher up is Vishnu in the form of a wild boar, in
which guise he lifts the world above the waters of the primordial ocean.
Superposed circles represent the seven worlds.
The first of the subtle centers within the human body is “the Base” (adhara
chakra), located in the region of the anus. It has four petals representing the
powers of the coiled energy. In the center is the five-faced god Shiva, the

principle of life. On his knees appears Ganapati, the elephant god, symbol of the
fundamental identity of macrocosm and microcosm, of human and god. Ganapati
is accompanied by his two wives, Success (Siddhi) and Intelligence (Buddhi).
The magic syllable that corresponds to this center is the character LANG.
The second center, “Support of Individuality” (svadhishthana chakra) is
located at the root of the genitals, where the gods Brahma, the creator, and the
principle of the waters, Varuna, reside. This center has six petals. The goddess
Savitri (hymn to the sun), Brahma’s daughter, rests on the god’s knees. The
magic formula found in the center is the character VANG, the principle of the
waters.
The coiled energy located at the base of the spine is presented as the third
center, although it can only be reached through one of the previous centers. This
power, known as “the Power of the Snake” is the principle of life and
consciousness itself. The solar and lunar energy circuits (male and female),
which govern the right and left sides of body and brain respectively, start from
here.
The fourth center, “the Jewel City” (manipura chakra), is found in the region
of the navel. There is the goddess of fortune (Shri, Shakti), bearing in her heart
Rudra, the lord of tears, and the divine vulture, Garuda. This is the center of the
fire principle, whose magic syllable is RANG.
The heart is presented here as a lotus-shaped center with nine petals,
although it can only be controlled starting from the next center.
The sixth center, located close to the heart, is that of “Inaudible Sound”
(anahata chakra). The god Shiva in his eternal form resides here with Uma, his
partner, and the golden fetus (hiranya garbha), the origin of the world. This is
the birthplace of the sacred syllable AUM. The center of life and vital breath, it
is the dwelling of the breathing principle and the magic syllable of air, YANG.
The seventh center is the center of “Great Purity” (vishudda chakra), located
in the throat. The goddess of Not-Knowing (Avidya) reigns over the seventh
center, wearing a necklace of human skulls. Virata, the cosmic Being, in his
hermaphroditic guise (Ardhanarishvara), who creates the world through his
dance, resides in her heart. This lotus has fortyfour petals. Corresponding to the
principle of ether, whose magic syllable is HANG, this center is the door of
liberation, through which the yogi can perceive the past and future.
The center of “Enjoyment” (dalana) is located in the face, where our senses
of perception are concentrated. The face is here called the “Upper Circle” and
the “witness of the inner faculties, the notion of individuality and the twenty-five
principles.” It is the meeting point of the three subtle arteries, ida, pingala, and
sushumna.

Between the eyebrows is the center of “Command” (ajna chakra), which is
where the third eye is located, through which all reality is perceived beyond the
limits of space and time. Its deity is the principle of Time (mahakala) and Death.
This center controls the mental functions.
Next we reach the center of “Fire” (agneya chakra) with its two petals. There
dwells the Supreme Lord, Paramatma. This is where the subtle body’s central
artery, known as sushumna, ends; through it the yogi—by the force of his power
—makes the coiled energy rise.
On the forehead is located the center of “Nectar,” whose cup is the moon and
whose symbol is the cow of abundance.
The eleventh center is the “Lotus of the Thousand Petals, the center of
Immortality,” which is located at the top of the cranium. Here resides the Guru,
the power of knowing (chaitanya shakti), as well as the mantra of identity “I am
That” (aham sah). Here dwells the lord of desire (Kama natha) and his lover, and
here, too, all the faculties dissolve into the Absolute.
Above is the double triangle of “Transcendent Energy,” with the magic
syllable of ether, HANG, at its center, while higher up still is the Linga, the
phallus, the divine object of all knowledge gripped in its receptacle, the image of
the female principle through which it is manifest in humans and in the universe.

A
Shaivism and the
Primordial Tradition
n element of consciousness acts as a kind of inactive witness in every atom
or conglomerate of atoms, in every cell, as well as at the center of the
“inner organ” (antahkarana), the principal engine of every living being.
This inner organ comprises three faculties: the mental (manas), which
thinks; intelligence (buddhi), which comprehends, chooses, and recalls; and the
sense of individuality or self (ahamkara), which allows each entity to affirm its
independence, or difference. The fourth element contained in the inner organ—
as in all other individual structures—is a fragment of consciousness (chit).
However, this consciousness does not really “belong” to the inner organ, since it
is inseparable from Universal Consciousness, just as the space contained in an
urn is only apparently and temporarily separated from the immensity of space in
which it loses its identity once the urn is broken. This total consciousness, of
which a fragment appears—as it were—imprisoned in all beings, is sometimes
called the universal soul (atman). In actual fact, the individual soul has no
autonomy at all, since it is not really separated from omnipresent total
consciousness.
The world garden is marvelous for its harmony, its fantasy, the beauty of its
structures, the variety of its forms, its plants, the beasts of all sorts that live in it
and are its ornaments, as well as its spectators, who perceive and enjoy its
incredible beauty. Through the consciousness present in all creatures, the
Absolute Being contemplates its work and delights in it. This perception and
admiration of the world takes place at two different levels. Among animals it is
merely aesthetic perception and enjoyment, but in human beings it can develop
into an analytical comprehension of the structures and harmonies that are the
secret of the beauty of beings and things. In this, the development of knowledge
(shana) plays an essential role. This second step in perceiving the world,
involving an understanding of its structures, is the superior stage in perceiving
the Creator’s work.

The game (lila) by which the Creator principle enjoys its creation through
witnesses who contemplate it and take part in it reveals the double function of
living beings, which is perception and knowledge. These functions are usually
divided between two categories of beings, apparently independent, but
profoundly linked, which are animals and spirits, whereas they are united in the
double nature of the human being.
Animals and plants are in some way the visible part of subtle beings, spirits,
genies, and gods, which govern and inhabit them. We can often make contact
with the spirits through their vegetal or animal twin. This is why certain animals
and trees are considered sacred. Through the respect and love we bear them, as
well as their worship, we attract the benevolence of the subtle spirits, genies, and
fairies that are their invisible twins, governing the aspects of the natural world.
In this dualism of subtle spirits and animals, perception and knowledge
functions are separated. In the human being, the divine game unites these two
aspects; the human animal gradually develops an aptitude for knowledge, having
in some way absorbed its subtle double, or guardian angel. This is why the
human species bears a double heritage: its genetic, or physical heritage, which
perceives external forms and delights in them, but is also part of the scenario;
and its initiatic heritage of knowledge, the aptitude to gradually comprehend the
nature of the world and certain aspects of its structure.
By developing the living body—which is where consciousness dwells—
through its perfection, evolution, and genetic progress, it is possible to develop
faculties suited to its intuitive role in analyzing the structures of creation, giving
rise to forms of knowledge (vidya) known as artistic expression and scientific
analysis.
At a certain moment in our evolution as human beings, we may develop
curiosity about world aspects that are normally perceived only by spirits and
gods. We then discover within ourselves the potential of perception beyond the
limitations imposed on us by the prison of our senses, allowing us only to
perceive external forms, which we share with animals.
THE THREE ELEMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE
In order to carry out our role as witnesses, not only of apparent forms, but of the
structures on which the various aspects of the universe are built, we need to
develop a triple faculty: a faculty of seeing that is independent of our senses; an
analytical faculty of a mathematical kind; and a faculty of externalizing,
communicating, a language. This is why, at a given moment in human

development, the three methods appear, making the formation and transmission
of knowledge possible. These three methods are called Yoga, Samkhya, and
Shabda.
In their effort to control and extend their suprasensory perceptions, the seers,
or rishis, of the first ages were led to develop Yoga techniques. Through these
methods they managed to pass beyond the limitations of the senses and the
conditioning of space and time. Thus they managed to see atoms (anima), or to
contemplate from the outside the cells that form stellar systems and galaxies
(sharima), which are the organs of the body of Purusha, the Universal Man. By
introspection, they also managed to perceive within themselves the relationships
of those forces that give birth to life, feeling, and thought.
The second faculty is the faculty of measurement, the mathematical spirit.
Any analysis of the structures of the cosmos, as well as of the geometric
harmonies that determine the nature of astral or atomic cells, and of the
conglomerates that constitute living beings, rests essentially on perception of
numerical factors. The word samkhya means “number” and is also the term
utilized to designate cosmology, which is the study of the countable, the
measurable, since, in the universe, everything is ultimately of a geometric and
harmonic nature.
Language is a system of sound symbols—words—allowing forms of thought
to be grasped and then externalized. It is thus a means of expression and
communication for Yoga perceptions and the analyses made through Samkhya.
VISION AND WORD
Like the substratum of thought, the seers’perception is by nature a vision
(pashyanti). But it is through the Word, by the audible structures (vaikhari) of
language, that the vision is externalized and communicated. This is why the birth
of the world, as the materialization of creative thought, is compared to the action
of the Word, the externalization of thought or vision. The knowledge tradition
potential starts from the moment when the aptitude for language develops.
Language is thus the essential element that differentiates humans from other
living species, at least those perceptible to us. In the evolution of life, the birth of
Homo sapiens as a species distinct from other animal species, capable of playing
a separate role in creation, coincides with the genetic appearance of the faculty
of speech, the incarnation of the Word. This is why, in human society, in parallel
with genetic transmission that perfects the physical body, the habitat of
knowledge, a further, initiatic transmission takes place, thanks to which the

visions of the seers of those early ages have been perpetuated through the
generations. This transmission constitutes what is termed “tradition”
(parampara).
MANVANTARA AND YUGA
In a universe where everything is number (samkhya) and movement (jagat), the
evolution and duration of the terrestrial world are determined by numerical
factors, cycles connected with the rhythms of the astral cell, of which the Sun is
for us the center, whose most visible forms are days, months, and years. Other
cycles regulate the life duration of individuals and species.
Seen from the modern view of history, can a date be given to the era when
the seers began to formulate what has come down to us as primordial tradition?
The only thing we can say is that, since knowledge is part of the raison d’être of
humanity, the seers’perception must have occurred when the evolution of the
species reached maturity, and when the human being became capable of playing
the role of witness. Like a flower that blossoms in due season, perception of the
world’s secrets appeared in the seers’spirit when humankind reached maturity.
We may note that, in actual fact, the seers’perceptions took place simultaneously
in various parts of the world, just as nowadays we find the same discoveries
appearing at the same time on different continents.
At some levels of knowledge however, aptitude is not simultaneous among
all variants of the species, since they are not all at the same level of evolution.
The tradition of one group cannot therefore be transferred to another.
The cycle corresponding to the duration of any human species is called
manvantara (the space of one Manu). The name Manu, the progenitor, means
“Man,” a term that corresponds to the Semitic “Adam,” which has the same
meaning. The manvantara is divided into four eras known as Yugas.
During the era known as the Age of Truth (Satya Yuga), Hesiod’s Golden
Age, the perceptions of the sages or seers (rishis) established the bases of this
approach to the world’s deep reality, which is the foundation of the primordial
tradition, the expression of universal laws (Sanatana Dharma).
The second era, the Age of the Three Ritual Fires (Treta Yuga), saw the
constitution of human society, the family, tribe, hierarchy, and royalty. Temporal
power was wielded by the king, who by his virtue was responsible for the
group’s prosperity. The sages, or seers, lived in the forest in contact with nature
and the spirits. There was no sacerdotal caste. Domestic rites were performed by
all, without any distinction of status. Life became sedentary; agriculture

developed. The fire god (Agni), now domesticated, became the center of the
family group, the hearth. Relationships between humans and with other species
—gods, spirits, animals, and plants—were formalized, in an effort to conform to
the universal laws. The search for harmony in human beings’relations with
nature, the definition of rites and other means of communicating with the gods,
and becoming integrated with the divine work, gave rise to a body of concepts
and practices that became known as Shaivism.
The third era, the Age of Doubt (Dvapara Yuga), saw the birth of various
mythologies, the philosophical schools, and atheistic doctrines. During this
period urban civilizations and the hierarchy of functions developed. Tradition
was preserved by wandering ascetics, the ajivikas (beggars), the kalamukhas
(black heads), and the kapalikas (wearers of skulls), living outside society.
The onset of the fourth era, the Age of Conflicts (Kali Yuga), saw the
appearance of city religions, concerned only with human beings. Humankind has
abandoned nature and become the enemy of other species. Religion has been
reduced to social codes, ethics. So-called prophets have set up innumerable sects
that fight each other. Tradition, transmitted by the initiates, has become esoteric
and hidden but is always alive and can reappear when the conditions of the cycle
are favorable.
Barbarian invaders, whose incursions everywhere marked the beginning of
the current Kali Yuga, imposed their myths and their culture in India, as also in
Greece and Rome, forcing the Shaivite-Dionysian tradition to go underground.
Hence two parallel traditions appeared: one, which is official (Vedic), and the
other, which is secret (Shaivite), thanks to which India manages to preserve the
organization that allows the primordial tradition to be transmitted through the
initiatic channels of the sannyasis. Some aspects of tradition also exist elsewhere
in an esoteric form, despite official religion.
Over the centuries, Shaivism has had a gradual and profound impact on
Vedic religion, giving rise to Hinduism. It was, however, only from the fourth
century b.C.E., at a time when rediscovered writing made it possible to confront
traditions, that transcriptions were made, on the one hand, of the Vedic texts and,
on the other, of a mass of documents deriving from the Shaivite tradition,
particularly the Agamas (traditions), Tantras (rules), and Puranas (legendary
accounts), most of which have still not been analyzed or published, but which
living tradition has perpetuated in secret down to our own times.
WRITING

Traditional knowledge was established strictly in the oral domain. Suprasensory
perception, analyzed in a mathematical spirit and externalized by word of mouth,
was expressed in condensed mnemotechnic formulas, known as “the
Approaches” (Upanishads).
Visual symbols—that is, the various forms of writing—only begin to be used
to fix certain elements of tradition when the evolution of the cycle announces the
decline of knowledge. Writing is a kind of external memorandum, which, at a
given moment, fixes formulas used as a basis for the transmission of knowledge
in verbal form, which can be compared to highly elaborate proverbs.
Artistic expression is the first step in written language, to the extent that it
recalls the harmonies of a numerical nature that constitute its beauty. Conceived
first in the form of images, or hieroglyphs, writing long remained tied to a verbal
externalization (vaikhari) of vision (pashyanti), which is fundamentally thought.
It therefore has an essentially approximate character, limited by the vocabulary
at the disposal of any particular language.
Language formulated by writing poses the danger of sterilization, although at
the same time it opens new possibilities, transferring learning from the domain
of visual and intuitive knowledge to that of intellectual and analytical science.
But when congealed writing contradicts living tradition, the “idolatry of the
book” appears and opposes tradition. The image of a deity in a temple is not the
god itself, but a support through which it can be evoked. Idolatry appears when
the statue itself is worshipped and not the subtle being it represents. Similarly,
blind belief in texts, whether the Vedas, the Bible, the Koran, or any other
“sacred book,” indicates ignorance of their nature.
The true Veda (from the root vid = knowledge) is the name given to the
perception of the body of laws that constitute the universe. It is thus the
expression of the Sanatana Dharma, the eternal or natural law. This world law
has sometimes been improperly confused with the expressions that various
traditions have sought to give it.
The texts known as the Vedas are merely attempts made at a given moment
to grasp something of the laws that lie at the basis of the structures of matter,
life, and the individual or social being and are limited by approximations that
characterize all language. The same is true of any form of knowledge, and of all
the sciences, which progress from approximation to approximation. As soon as
any attempt is made to turn the knowledge of an era into a gospel, the whole
discovery is paralyzed. Dogmatism is the very foundation of ignorance (avidya).
Worship of the sacred book, envisaged as a materialization of divine thought,
mistakes the symbol for reality and is thus basically idolatry. It is opposed to the
very process of the evolution of knowledge, as represented by tradition, and ends

up denying it. That is why “religions of the book” rapidly abandon tradition,
which then takes refuge in secret forms of initiatic and esoteric transmission.
I had the chance of observing a similar phenomenon with the poet
Rabindranath Tagore. His poems were always sung. In the morning, he would
gather his disciples and sing to them his new composition, which they learned by
heart. Some of them tried to transcribe the words and set down the tune. A few
years later, it was the people who had learned the songs from the notes—“the
people of the book”—who claimed to hold the true version and opposed those
who had inherited the oral tradition, which was nevertheless much more
accurate.
It is not that “sacred books” are necessarily absurd. They are simply obsolete
as soon as they are created. They represent stages. What are absurd are the
“religions of the book” that, in a world in perpetual development, seek to
paralyze the evolution of knowledge, that marvelous adventure that is for
humans the sinuous path of discovery, which gradually discloses the secrets of
the divine nature of the world.
SCIENCE AND TRADITION
Only intensive selection allows the various human lineages to reach the type of
physical perfection that constitutes a favorable habitat for the inner organ, that
instrument of knowledge through which a human being can fully realize his or
her destiny as a witness. This destiny is not quantitative. A few individuals are
sufficient, or even one alone, to let the indwelling fragment of Universal
Consciousness contemplate its work, admire it, and delight in it.
When the heritage of traditional knowledge is debased, the human intellect
seeks other means to penetrate the world’s secrets. That is why, in our own time,
when the prodigious knowledge of shamans, sorcerers, and sannyasis is tending
to disappear, we find that astrophysicists or biologists rediscover certain
fundamental principles of the nature of the world, such as the relativity of space
and time, and the structures of life, which—although obtained by other methods
—match the data given by the teaching of the rishis, the seers.
The direct view of structures provided by Yoga and the intellectual research
of science are two methods aimed at a common goal, which is that of allowing
the Supreme Principle to admire the plan of its work through the mirror of
individual consciousness. That is why discovery is such a source of joy. Science
and clairvoyance are two parallel branches of the same effort of knowledge and
are not clearly separated. Scientific discoveries, too, are inspired. Their starting

point is intuition, an inner light that resembles clairvoyance. Rationalization only
takes place later on.
There is no difference between the nature of the perceptions of clairvoyants
and the discoveries of scholars; the only differences are in method and
limitation. Both paths are totally free of any a priori reasoning, any dogmatism,
any belief or religion, any prophet or human character. Clairvoyants and
scientists are the tools of Universal Consciousness, which is independent of the
bodies in which it dwells, and is amused by such discoveries.
It is through our love for the forms of the visible world, through the joy that
it gives us, and by our effort to understand its nature and structures that we
realize our role and communicate with the divine that dwells in us.
THE PERMANENCE OF TRADITION
The life of a species follows the same process as for an individual. It has its
childhood, maturity, and decline and is eliminated when it ceases to play the role
assigned to it in the harmony of creation as a physical species and as a mirror of
Universal Consciousness. This is why tradition, even when it is wholly esoteric
and hidden, remains indestructible and operational. Invisible initiates from far
off inspire the forms of knowledge, the discoveries of science, so that human
beings can play their role of witness for the amusement of the Creator. However,
when knowledge—instead of being a means for the delectation of the Absolute
Being—becomes a tool for the destruction of the divine work, the apprentice
sorcerers are eliminated.
The “catastrophes brought about” that will mark the end of the cycle will
lead to a long night, after which, Shiva, through his dance, will give birth to a
new humankind. New seers will then rediscover with amazement the secrets of
the world and will reestablish knowledge for the pleasure of the Absolute Being.
Humankind has already disappeared and been reborn six times and each time a
reestablished tradition has marked its steps.

Light on Samkhya and Poetry
by Jean-Louis Gabin
he esoteric knowledge shared with the West by Alain Daniélou was, in
fact, the very core of research by poets and thinkers of the Romantic Era in
Europe and in modern French literature, in particular Hugo, Baudelaire,
and Rimbaud. The part of his works that has a direct bearing on poetry, namely
Samkhyan theories, thus throws new light on that poetry, particularly
Baudelaire’s “Correspondances” and Rimbaud’s “Voyelles.”
But firstly, what is Samkhya? The Indians may know, but only a few Indian
specialists would be able to answer this question in the West. In any case, no one
in the field of literary research or comparative poetry—with the exception of
René Daumal, whose works, fifty years after his death, are still confidential—
has ever, to my knowledge, thought of using these notions to comment on the
works of Baudelaire. We should note that this intellectual ignorance is the
subject of an essay by Roger Pol Droit, L’Oubli de l’Inde, which expresses
surprise as to why this discovery has never been made, when all the thinkers of
the nineteenth century, from Hegel to Kierkegaard and Goethe, including
Nietzsche, considered that the translation of the Vedas and the discovery of the
Upanishads and Puranas would, in the twentieth century, produce a revelation
comparable to that of the Greek texts during the Renaissance. He also wonders
why the departments of philosophy in the universities and great Western schools
continue to ignore the traditional speculative thought of India: Nyaya, or logic;
Samkhya, or cosmology; and Advaita, nondualism.
Several of Daniélou’s works expound the theories of the ancient Samkhya.1
In While the Gods Play, for example, he writes: For the Samkhyas, the universe
develops starting from elementary formulas … expressible in mathematical or
geometric terms (in this case known as Yantras), common to all aspects of
creation. There is no difference of nature between the formulas at the basis of the

structures of the atoms of matter, the order of the stars, the principles of life, or
the mechanisms of perception and thought, which are all parallel and
interdependent manifestations of energy.”2
The relation with comparative poetry appears immediately, if one thinks of
Baudelaire’s rightly famous sonnet “Correspondences”3 in the Flowers of Evil,
which in our own time seems much more than a poem and much more than a
theory, starting from its very first words. Its splendor contains a kind of message
and even a warning for infinite meditation: In Nature’s temple, living pillars
rise,
Speaking sometimes in words of abstruse sense;
Man walks through woods of symbols, dark and dense Which gaze at him
with found familiar eyes.
Like distant echoes blent in the beyond
In unity, in a deep darksome way,
Vast as black night and vast as splendent day,
Perfumes and sounds and colors correspond.
Some scents are cool as children’s flesh is cool, Sweet as are oboes, green
as meadowlands
—And others rich, corrupt, triumphant, full,
Expanding as infinity expands:
Benzoin or musk or amber that incense,
Hymning the ecstasy of soul and senses.4
Much could now be said about this sonnet: First, on the metaphor with which it
begins, the reaffirmation of Nature’s sacred character, traversed by the
“abstruse” or confused words of the forces that have created it. “Confused
words” indeed: in the West this message has been obfuscated as Ronsard
pathetically proclaimed three centuries earlier, in 1584, in his elegy inspired by
the destruction of the forest of Gastine. And it is significant that it was in the
mid-nineteenth century—at a time when triumphant mercantilism and
materialism considered the natural world merely as raw material for their
enterprises—that the voice of poetry was once again raised, putting the world on
guard against a final profanation, in an attempted appeal to forgotten wisdom
and knowledge.
We may ask ourselves by what means a poem, a vision that is—first and

foremost, according to modern theorists of poetry—strictly personal, “original,”
even “whimsical” (for less indulgent commentators, who wonder whether
Baudelaire really did stick to his theory) could so precisely link up with
knowledge whose details were unknown in the Europe of his time? Part of the
answer was articulated by Baudelaire himself when he said: “Imagination is the
most scientific of faculties because it encompasses and understands universal
analogy.”5
Neither the writings of Franciscans and Thomists, nor the works of
Swedenborg or Fourier explored by the exegetes of the Fleurs du Mal ever go so
far in their vision of “universal analogy” as the Samkhya texts revealed by
Daniélou to the French-speaking public and later published in translation in the
United States. He specifically explores the connections between those theories
and literary research in a chapter of While the Gods Play entitled “The Nature of
Language,” from which the following quotations are taken: Language, by means
of which we are able to materialize thought and describe the apparent world as
perceived by our senses, must therefore present to us characteristics analogous to
those of the process by which the universe develops… . By delving back to the
sources of language, and to the process by which thought is transformed into
speech we should be able to uncover something of the way in which the creative
principle that is the divine “Word” is manifest in creation.
The simplest form of vibration that our senses can perceive is the
vibration of air, which, within certain limits, we sense as a sound. We can
use sound vibration as a starting point and means of comparison for an
understanding of the other, more complex vibratory states—whether they
concern the structures of matter or nature of life, or the phenomena of
perception and thought.
The organ of speech is constituted as a yantra, a symbolic diagram. The
palatal vault (like the celestial vault) forms a hemisphere with five points
of articulation allowing the emission of five groups of consonants, five
main vowels, two mixed vowels, and two secondary vowels, assimilated
to the planets.
Likewise in the musical scale, there are five main notes, two secondary
ones, and two alternative notes, which are not arbitrary, but correspond to
fundamental numerical relationships between the sound vibrations that we
find at the basis of all musical systems. Our perception of colors has
analogous characteristics.”6
Such notions are strangely close to certain ideas of Baudelaire when, on the
subject of Wagner’s music, he establishes a link between “God who articulates

the world as a complex and indivisible totality” and “the reciprocal analogy” that
lets a sound suggest color, colors suggest a melody, and both sounds and colors
translate ideas. There is, however, a further very distinct parallel between
Samkhya theories, as expounded by Daniélou, and the poetry of Rimbaud,
particularly his sonnet “Voyelles”7 or “Vowels”: A black, E white, I red, U
green, O blue: vowels, I shall tell, one day, of your mysterious origins: A, black
velvety jacket of brilliant flies
Which buzz around cruel smells,
Gulfs of shadow; E, whiteness of vapours and of tents, Lances of proud
glaciers, white kings, shivers of cow-parsley; I, purples, spat blood,
smile of beautiful lips
In anger or in the raptures of penitence;
U, waves, divine shuddering of viridian seas,
The peace of pastures dotted with animals, the peace of the furrows Which
alchemy prints on broad studious foreheads; O, sublime Trumpet full of
strange piercing sounds, Silences crossed by Worlds and by Angels:
O the Omega, the violet ray of Her Eyes!8
In discussions, reviews, and critical editions on Rimbaud, a wide variety of
propositions are put forward to find the “key” to this sonnet, which has
particularly excited the imagination. I feel that nothing serves better than these
passages from Alain Daniélou’s comments on the Samkhyas: Particular vowels
are associated with specific colors. Color differences are due to the frequency
ratios of light waves, just as musical sounds are defined by the frequency of
sound waves… . According to Ragunandan Sharma’s Akshara Vijnana, the
fourteen vowels correspond to the following colors: A = white
I = red
U = yellow
Ë (ri) = bluish-black
Ò = black, etc.
These vowels and colors correspond to those that characterize the cycles in
which new human species are born and die.9
Although scholars are undecided about the possibility of initiatic
transmission in the case of Rimbaud—who wrote in his Illuminations: “where is
the old brahman who taught me proverbs?”—he was indisputably in contact with
occult circles and had certainly read Eliphas Levi, just as Baudelaire read
Swedenborg. This analysis by Jean Biès of Rimbaud’s life and work follows

such a reading: Who could deny that Rimbaud is a “Seer,” even though his
clairvoyance is clouded by imperfections and reminiscences? Rimbaud is
conscious of the mysterious power of words, anxious to go back to the origin of
language and, on attaining the vision of it, to reach the state of awakening.
Nothing of all this is formulated clearly, but the intention oozes everywhere and
in a singular way links the young sixteen-year-old boy of Charleville … with the
Kavi and Rishi of primordial times… .
From a biographical point of view, the element of anarchic violence
concealed in Rimbaud should not be overlooked in any possible
comparison with India. We know that revolt and destruction are a
formidable manifestation of transcendence; we also know that the East
makes positive use of them, whereas the West, being incapable of
channeling such forces, pitches them against the structures of the
contingent world, instead of employing them for the purpose of inner
cleansing. This reversal of priorities, this total absence of ritualization,
ends by being fatal to those handling such forces without knowing their
nature and function properly. In that decadent atmosphere that was his
own, Rimbaud appeared as a co-operator in the nivrtti marga, the
destructive phase of the rotating cycle. With Sade, he is one of the rare
adepts, though more intellectual, of the vama shara, “the way of the left
hand.” Through drink, drugs, sexuality and nomadism, his rejection of
institutions, his blasphemies, Rimbaud could have gone further than
scandalizing the middle class: like the Shaktas, he could have become the
reconciler of the shade and light within himself, but he did not do so. The
destructive element even ended by taking the upper, leading the poet to
existential dissolution and scriptural renunciation; and this owing to lack
of preparation, lack of training and spiritual guidance. As a self-taught,
and as an inexperienced improviser, Rimbaud hazarded himself on the
most perilous of paths. His inner potentials did not find in his
circumstances the support needed for their development… . Rimbaud is
our Shaivite, in the wild state.10
In fact,11 nineteenth century France, which marks the triumph of bourgeois
hegemony, witnessed a clandestine efflorescence of esoteric research until the
materialism and the messianism of the social utopias came to occupy the areas
where the former state religion seems to have shut off the pathways of
metaphysical research. In the twentieth century, following Proudhonism,
Marxism—which is a parody of religion—expressly tried to consolidate the
“positive aspects” of the bourgeois revolution, namely: globalization of the

market, dictatorship of human over nature, armed conversion of different
civilizations, the fight against traditions, and spiritual life labeled as
“obscurantism” even in the domain of art.
Thus, in France, during a major part of the twentieth century, even the poetic
art had to serve as an auxiliary to modern, nationalist, political, and social
ideologies. While on the communists’ side, Aragon earned for himself a sinister
immortality with his “Ode to the Genial Stalin,” on the Christians’ side, Claudel
wrote verses comparing the parachutists of the French colonial army in
Indochina to Archangel Saint Michel’s legions thrashing the demons.
In contrast, the writers of the “Grand jeu,” René Daumal in particular,
became interested in Vedic tradition but did not get access to Shaivism and to
Tantra. André Breton was interested in occult sciences but condemned the
traditional societies and ultimately the René Guénon approach as well, despite
his fascination for it.
Some other dissidents partly rediscovered the pathway opened up by
Rimbaud: Yves Bonnefoy with Douve, which is a collection full of Gnostic
inquiries, or Gilbert Lely, the most concealed among them, who sings “Notre-
Dame de Lumière,” an erotic poetry of cosmic proportions: O, luxury of my
sperm in the night of thy thighs!
Up over there, the homologous semen of the Milky Way.
Or else:
The unity–queen sparkled
The world proved to itself. Nothing was more sparse.
O hymenean walls, pandects of azur!
O melting pot of an incorruptible alliance
Thou, space, mountains, Sade, future days
The voluptuousness, the verb, in a single diamond.12
The mention of Sade, a passionate atheist and anti-Christian writer, shows that
the research of most French poets of the twentieth century could not often come
out of the confines of a sense of revolt that was perfectly comprehensible. The
same was also the case for the American poets, whereas in the nineteenth
century the sense of nature as both sensuous and spiritual—such as in Walt
Whitman—was on several counts comparable to that of Baudelaire. It was the
rebellious Rimbaud who came to have a direct influence on the Beat Generation,
particularly the well-known poet Allen Ginsberg, who succeeded in

reestablishing ties with India through Tantric Buddhism, quite close to the “left-
hand path” of Shaivism. The revolt of the European poets, however, resulted
rather in a refusal of all established paths, even secret, a refusal of all cadres, of
all masters, of all traditions. This lead to an hypertrophy of the self, to the
Luciferian or Promethean overestimation of the ego in which so many poets got
stuck like spiders in their own webs.
The type of intellectual confusion cultivated by Breton vis-à-vis his
relationship with the incisive clarity of thoughts of Guénon is an indication: As
per the analysis of André Coynet, Breton would have: … all along wanted to
play on the language of Tradition while at the same time denying its spirit,
which amounts to simply and purely denying the Tradition itself, that to the
extent of getting confused whenever he talks about it. The following 1948
declaration, [which] causes one to wonder what it means, is one of the proofs: “It
is hardly a question of knowing whether or not a strict written or oral tradition
could have really extended from Antiquity to modern times (although this is
exactly the constant objection of the common man) but a question of identifying
whether the works which continue to have an influence on us maintain or not
appreciable relationships with this tradition even if impure.”13
This overestimation of the ego, which darkens the relationship of the most
innovative French poets vis-à-vis the sacred, is certainly most directly expressed
by René Char in a poem that bears testimony to a poignant nostalgia and also
simultaneously to some sort of complacency, to an incapability of discrimination
or of humility that can only end up in a spoiled encounter: We are not jealous of
the gods, we do not serve them, we are not afraid of them. But at the risk of our
life, we attest their multiple existence and we get emotional about belonging to
their adventurous breed when their souvenir ceases.14
But the remains of the occult tradition and whatever still-living spirituality
subsisted in our civilization seem to have taken refuge in this “damned” poetry.
Who better than the seventeen-year-old Rimbaud can sum up for us the approach
to Tantrism itself: “I say we must become clairvoyant, through a long, immense
and reasoned deregulation of all our senses”? What text expresses better than his
poem Soleil et chair the life-giving nostalgia for the Golden Age and its past
reality?
These poetic intuitions, heirs of a persecuted tradition, are answered by the
theories of Shaivite cosmology and the Tantras, so eloquently given voice to by
Alain Daniélou.

  7.   Note that during the nineteenth and for most of the twentieth centuries,
French Indian studies focused almost exclusively on Buddhism, which had
disappeared in India twelve centuries earlier. See, for example: Pierre

today, there is no Chair of Shaivism at the Collège de France.
  8.   As the texts were composed over a period of more than fifty years, it is not
surprising that there are occasional differences of expression and even
apparent contradictions between them, bearing witness to the vital
development of Alain Daniélou’s thought, even though Alain Daniélou
himself revised these new versions between 1990 and 1992. Also, to avoid
repetitions, certain parts of the original texts have been eliminated or

About the Authors Alain Daniélou (1907-1994) spent more
than 15 years in the traditional society of India, using only the
Sanskrit and Hindi languages and studying music and
philosophy with eminent scholars. He was duly initiated into
esoteric Shaivism, which gave him unusual access to texts
transmitted through the oral tradition alone. He is the
author of more than 30 books on the religion, history, and arts
of India and the Mediterranean.
JEAN-LOUIS GABIN, Ph.D., began his collaboration with Alain Daniélou
while he was still alive. He is working on an additional Ph.D. in
Philosophy of Religion and Indology on the subject “Tradition and
Modernity in the works of Alain Daniélou.” He also has edited and
published five posthumous collections of Daniélou’s work in French as
well as serving as editor of the English edition of India: A Civilization of
Differences.

Note: Because classical Sanskrit diacritical marks were handled inconsistently in the original publication of
essays included in this collection, the American editor has decided to dispense with them for all U.S.
editions of this book. This decision in no way reflects upon Alain Daniélou’s mastery of Sanskrit.
