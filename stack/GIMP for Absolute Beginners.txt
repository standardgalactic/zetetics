About the Author 
Jan Smith has been taking photos for more than 20 years; her photos 
have been reproduced in a range of media. In 2000 she studied digital 
imaging at the Adelaide Central School of Art and moved from the 
darkroom to digital editing with relief.  
Jan discovered GIMP nine years ago while volunteering at 
Computerbank (a non profit company refurbishing donated 
computers for low income people). She helped people become 
familiar with computers loaded with open-source software. She has 
developed a solid grasp of the way beginners learn to use software. 
Jan has worked as a technical writer for Infrae in the Netherlands 
and for companies using open-source software in Australia.  She was 
elected Vice President of the Zope Foundation in 2010.  She has a 
background in radio journalism, technology and production. 
 
Roman Joost first learned about open-source software in 1997. He is 
the project manager of GIMP’s user documentation and he has 
contributed code to GIMP. He has contributed to GIMP and Zope 
open-source projects for eight years.  
Roman has a Diplom-Informatiker (FH) from Anhalt University of 
Applied Sciences in Koethen, Germany. He has worked for Gocept 
GmbH & Co. in Germany, Infrae in the Netherlands, and is currently 
working for another Zope company in Brisbane, Australia. For 
relaxation, he enjoys photography and digital painting with GIMP.

Acknowledgments 
Thanks to my husband, Darce Cassidy, for his feedback, patience, cooking and the photo on 
page 73. Thanks to my son, Michael Cassidy, for his sage-like comments. Thanks to Anna Rigg 
for the photo on page 60. Thanks to Robyn Harvey for your friendship and encouragement. To 
Arthur Dent, thanks for nagging me in 1999 to get involved in open-source software,where 
intelligence and cooperation  help overcome short-sighted, greedy, vendor lock-in. 
A special thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine; the book is richer for your helpful and incisive 
technical review. Thanks to Roman for writing the painting and drawing chapters and for 
sticking with the project, even after the arrival of your first child. Thanks to Jessica Belanger, 
Matt Wade, Nancy Wright, Kimberly Burton, Mary Behr, Dylan Wooters, Leah Weissburg, and 
the team at Apress who helped whip this book into shape. Thanks also to the members of the 
Parklands Photo Club and others who filled out the digital editing survey.  
Thanks to Jernej Simonifor making GIMP available to Windows users and to everyone 
involved in the development of this powerful software. 
 —Jan Smith 
 
Thanks to my family for the support they gave me; without I would have not been able to 
participate in this book. Thanks to Anne Schneider, my brother Lars, my wife and Ross Copping 
for checking my chapters and trying various exercises. Additional thanks goes to my brother 
Lars for his artwork in Figure 8-26 on page 198. To my uncle Dr. Wolfgang Joost, a dedicated 
thanks for your inspiration.  
I would like to thank Jan Smith for the countless effort she put into this book and her 
support in general. Without her, this book would have not been possible.  
Thanks again to the many GIMP developers and people in the free software community, 
like Sven Neumann, Michael Natterer, Alexandre Prokoudine, Martin Nordholds, and many 
more who helped me contribute to this application. Thanks to the documentation team who 
put in a lot of effort into making the GIMP user manual better with each release.  
I would also like to thank Jakub Steiner and Garrett LeSage for their contributions to the 
free software community; they inspired me to contribute, too. 
—Roman Joost

Discover the fun of digital drawing and painting without messy paints 
and a wet canvas 
If you need something more than a simple digital editing program, GIMP could be for you. 
GIMP has the ability to sandwich different elements to make up a picture. It also has controls 
for cropping, scaling, exposure, brightness, contrast, color balance, sharpening, and a vast 
number of ways of selecting objects in an image. There are a large number filter effects for 
photos and drawings. Images can convert to a large range of file formats. 
Volunteer programmers, designers, and writers have been developing GIMP for more than 
fifteen years. The 2012 release of GIMP version 2.8 has new features, such as Single-Window 
Mode and Paint Dynamics. GIMP traditionally has three separate windows. Single-Window 
Mode joins the three windows into one workspace. With Paint Dynamics enabled, brush strokes 
mimic real-world brush strokes.

GIMP for Windows, Mac, and Linux 
This book covers GIMP 2.8 and explains GIMP for Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you have an 
older version of GIMP, please upgrade so that you can use GIMP’s latest features, which are 
described in this book. GIMP is free to upgrade because it is free software.  
Why Does GIMP Have an Odd-Sounding Name? 
This is a question often asked of the GIMP community. 
GIMP stands for GGNU Image Manipulation Program. It was originally called The GIMP, 
but today the correct name is GIMP. Developers of GIMP are happy with this name. 
This Book Is for Beginners 
This is book is written for absolute beginners to digital image editing and digital drawing. We 
presume you have a working knowledge of your computer, its operating system, how to use a 
mouse, and find items in a menu system. You should also be able to find your images on your 
computer. We do not expect you to have used GIMP or any other digital image editing software. 
This guide is to help you get up and running editing your images using a wide range of options 
and to get started with digital drawing. 
Some people have the luxury of learning digital image editing in a classroom with the help 
and support of teachers and other students. This book presumes you have no one to turn to for 
help or for encouragement with your GIMP project.  
There is nothing like the exhilarating feeling of transforming an ordinary image into a very 
good or even a great image. It is not so great if you are stuck or if you do not know how to do 
something in GIMP. It is even worse if you do not know the technical name for the task that you 
are trying to complete. Forgetting or not knowing the technical name for a task can happen 
with any image-editing program, not just GIMP. 
We have reduced the emphasis on technical terms such as, masks, paths, channels, layers, 
filters, and so on. However, this does not mean we do not cover these topics. If you know what 
these concepts mean, you can look them up in the index at the back of the book. Beginners 
using this book will get to use some or all of these concepts depending on the projects they 
choose to do. 
The Focus Is on Problem Solving 
The focus of this book is on tasks and problem solving. We tested chapters in this book with 
people who had never used GIMP and with people new to digital editing. We also surveyed 
camera club users and took note of their responses. For some, the hardest part was finding 
things in GIMP. Throughout the book, we help you locate tools and menu options. Some people 
want to jump in and start editing straight away. Others need an overview and a clear roadmap. 
Not everyone learns a new skill the same way. This book covers a few approaches to learning.  
You can read each chapter in turn or you can just read the section that solves your current 
digital editing task or problem. It is your choice. 
Throughout the book, we point out traps for new digital editors.  

 
xx 
Will I Be Successful in Using GIMP? 
If you use GIMP once a year, you are not going to be successful in using GIMP. To get the 
maximum benefit from GIMP, like anything worthwhile, you must practice. If you do not have 
lots of time, we suggest you learn one or two useful tasks in GIMP. It is then easy to build on this 
and increase your skills.  
Is GIMP Too Complicated? 
If you are worried that GIMP may be too difficult or geeky for you, you are probably wrong. If 
you can you pass exams, drive a car, cook, sew, hold down a job, or find your way around a new 
city with a map, then you have sufficient skills to try GIMP. If you have a fear of computers, then 
think of your computer as a mere tool for your creativity, rather than a barrier. 
Have you used another image-editing program? Do not expect GIMP to do things exactly 
the same way. GIMP does some tasks differently; for instance to save a JPG image, you export it 
rather than save it. There may be a learning curve for you. This book tries to resolve those 
hiccups and differences.  
Photoshop and GIMP Comparisons 
You may have been using Photoshop and have decided to try GIMP. Things will not necessarily 
be in the same place in both programs. Our hints and tips section in Chapter 10 looks at the 
similarities and differences between Photoshop and GIMP. GIMP is more complex than 
Photoshop Elements. 
Why Is GIMP Free? 
People participate in open-source software for similar reasons that people play or follow a 
sport. They like the code and they enjoy the social aspects. Open-source developers believe in 
sharing knowledge freely. Working on an open-source project is a way for people to have fun, to 
build something they need, to share, to compete, to extend their knowledge, to help others, to 
be part of a community, and for some, to become well-known in that community.  
The History of GIMP  
The story of GIMP’s development helps explain how open-source programs evolve and extend.  
In 1995, two university students, Peter Mattis and Spencer Kimball, developed the first 
version of GIMP for a project at the University of California at Berkeley. After the completion of 
the class project, they decided to extend their small project. Peter worked on the plug-in 
architecture and Spencer worked on core GIMP. This meant they were working on very separate 
pieces of the architecture. They were complimentary teammates.  

 
xxi 
Collaboration and Sharing in the Open-Source World 
Peter and Spencer did not develop in isolation; they participated in newsgroups and mailing 
lists. In July 1995, Peter answered a mailing list question about plug-ins, gave his own solution, 
and offered further information, if needed. A few months later, Peter asked a newsgroup, “What 
kind of features should (image manipulation software) have? (Tools, selections, filters, etc.) 
What file formats should it support?”  
They were developing, sharing, evolving, and collaborating with others from the beginning. 
By July 1996, GIMP had two mailing lists, the gimp-user and the gimp-developer mailing 
lists. In 1997, Peter and Spencer graduated from the university and stopped contributing to the 
GIMP project. By then, however, other people were contributing to GIMP and are continuing to 
do so today.  
GPLv3 License for GIMP 
GIMP 2.8 has a GPLv3 license. The GPLv3 license allows people to use GIMP for no charge. 
Additionally, developers can use or make a copy of the source code and add to it or turn it into 
something else entirely. Developers can distribute this new version, as long as the original code 
and the new code have the same sharing conditions. You can read the full license details in 
Appendix B. 
GIMP 2.8 
Released in 2012, this version of GIMP has a number of new features. 
• 
Single-Window Mode gives the option of joining GIMP’s three windows 
into one window. 
• 
Single-Window Mode incorporates the navigation of open images via 
thumbnails. 
• 
With Brush Dynamics enabled, the thickness and opacity of a brush 
depends on the pressure, speed, and angle of your mouse or graphical 
tablet. 
• 
Brushes now have the option of rotation. 
• 
There is an improved text tool. 
• 
Enhanced resource management allows for tagging of frequently-used 
tools. 
• 
Layers have a locking feature to avoid accidental strokes. 
• 
There is improved ability to customize GIMP’s tools and workspace. 
• 
The Cage Transform Tool enables you to alter the shape of a subject, 
while keeping it realistic-looking. 

 
xxii 
400,000 Downloads a Week? 
According to SourceForge, every week more than 400,000 people download GIMP for Windows 
and Mac from its web site alone.  
Summary 
GIMP is a sophisticated, open-source image-editing program. If you have basic computer skills, 
it is possible to learn GIMP. This book guides the person new to graphics and digital editing 
software. Use this book to solve some simple graphics tasks, then come back to the book to try 
tasks that are more complex.

Finding and Installing GIMP 
In This Chapter 
• 
Where to find GIMP 
• 
How to install GIMP on your computer 
Is This Chapter for You? 
• 
If you have installed a program on your computer before, try this chapter. 
• 
If you have not installed a program on your computer before, ask the person who 
usually adds extras to your computer for help. Do not forget to hand them your usual 
bribe and this chapter. They will be pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to install 
GIMP. 
• 
If you want to install GIMP from the source code, this chapter is not for you. Try the 
online resources at www.gimp.org. 
You may still be hesitating and asking yourself if you should try GIMP. GIMP is one of the 
very few free programs that provides an alternative to expensive advanced photo editing software 
such as Photoshop. If you use Photoshop and are trying GIMP for the first time, Chapter 10 covers 
the similarities and differences between GIMP and Photoshop. When you download GIMP, you 
will not be alone; there have been over 112 million downloads of GIMP for Windows. 
You probably have some photos you would like to improve or play around with but you 
aren’t sure if this will be easily accomplished. We try to make editing in GIMP as easy as possible 
for a beginner so you can focus on your creativity. 
Will GIMP work on your computer? GIMP is available for computers with Windows, Mac, or 
Linux operating systems, and it needs 1GB or more of RAM. Do not put GIMP on an old computer 
from your garage and then blame GIMP if it runs slowly. 
This chapter shows you where to find and download GIMP and how to install it for Windows, 
Mac, and Linux. GIMP 2.8 was used for this book, but older versions are available. However, since 
GIMP is free, we see no need to use an older version. And GIMP 2.8 has some very useful new 
features! 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FINDING AND INSTALLING GIMP 
2 
As mentioned, you will not be the first person to download and try GIMP.  
• 
There are over 400,000 weekly downloads of GIMP for Windows from SourceForge.  
• 
There are around 40,000 weekly downloads of GIMP for Mac from SourceForge.  
• 
For Linux, it is guestimated that there are more weekly downloads than GIMP for 
Mac. 
GIMP Works on Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux 
GIMP is available for the following Microsoft Windows systems: 
• 
Win7 
• 
Vista 
• 
XP 
• 
Windows Portable is a GIMP application for a USB drive, CD, DVD, etc. 
■ Note Older versions of Windows can run older versions of GIMP. However, very old versions of GIMP 
look and behave differently than the examples given in this book. 
GIMP is available for the following Apple Macintosh systems: 
• 
Snow Leopard 10.6x 
• 
Leopard 10.5x 
• 
Tiger 10.4x 
GIMP works on both PC- and Intel-based Macs. The GIMP for Mac download comes bundled 
with a number of extra photo editing and retouching tools.  
■ Note A very old version of GIMP will run on Panther 10.3 but it lacks many of the features talked about 
in this book. GIMP will not run on version 9 of the Macintosh operating system.  
GIMP is easy to install on the following Linux systems: 
•

• 
Slackware 
• 
OpenSUSE 
• 
Ubuntu  
Most other versions of Linux also support GIMP but the installation may be more 
complicated. 
System Requirements 
GIMP 2.8+ runs well on computers that are one to three years old. GIMP needs 1GB of RAM to 
run. More RAM is definitely an advantage, especially when working on large images.  
GIMP will run on Windows or Mac computer without conflicting with other graphic software 
such as Photoshop. 
GIMP Is Free Open Source Software 
GIMP is free of charge. It is not only free of charge but you are free to use and share this program 
with as many people as you wish. Beginners can use GIMP; in fact, this book aims to help 
beginners become proficient at using GIMP. At the other end of the spectrum, if you’re a 
programmer, you’re free to change the source code to suit your needs, provided you agree to 
keep the GIMP source code open. This means it is possible to use, share, and enhance GIMP. 
There is a copy of the full GIMP GNU General Public License v 3 in Appendix B. 
GIMP has a large online community of users. You are welcome to be a part of this online 
community no matter where you live—you just need an Internet connection. GIMP is available in 
a large number of languages. 
This chapter focuses on downloading GIMP 2.8+ released in 2012. If you have an older 
version of GIMP, now is the time to upgrade—GIMP is free. See the following sections for 
instructions for downloading and installing GIMP on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  
Windows: Downloading and Installing GIMP  
Downloading and installing GIMP on Win7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP is easy. Anyone who 
has downloaded a program on a Windows computer can do this. If you have never downloaded 
anything before, try now.

Congratulations! You can now open GIMP the same way you open any other program.  
Tiger: Downloading and Installing GIMP 
The GIMP Tiger installation requires an extra step: you need to install X11. You can get X11 from 
your Tiger installation DVD or go to the Apple Tiger support web page and follow the instructions 
for installing X11. After you install X11, follow the steps for Snow Leopard, discussed in the 
previous section. (Snow Leopard and Leopard come with X11 installed.) 
■ Note If you have OS X 10.3 Panther, you can only run an older version of GIMP: GIMP 2.2. It will look 
and act differently than the examples in this book.  
GNU/Linux 
GIMP is available for most Linux operating systems. Look for GIMP in your Linux Applications 
menu. The following systems will have GIMP installed or will have an easy software installer:  
• 
Debian 
• 
Fedora 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FINDING AND INSTALLING GIMP 
12 
• 
Gentoo Portage 
• 
Slackware 
• 
OpenSuse 
• 
Ubuntu  
If these options don’t work for your version of Linux, install GIMP using the package 
management system for your Linux distribution. The distribution maintainers check for any 
dependent files and do the bug fix updates for GIMP. You can also get GIMP via the command 
line. Both these options are beyond the scope of this beginner’s book. For further information on 
downloading using the package management system or downloading via the command line, go 
to www.gimp.org.  
Ubuntu 
If you are new to Linux, here’s how to install GIMP on one of its most popular distributions: 
Ubuntu. Ubuntu Lucid and later distributions don’t come with GIMP installed.

You will be taken to a list of programs. Scroll down to GIMP and click on Install. 
4. 
When asked, type in your usual Ubuntu password. 
5. 
You may be asked to approve extra files or dependencies for GIMP. There may also be 
security update files. Agree to install these files. 
6. 
Click Install. GIMP will download and install into your Ubuntu system. 
When the files are installed on your computer, GIMP will be available in the 
Applications/Graphics menu. The first time GIMP starts, it starts slowly because it is loading a 
number of tools. GIMP will start much faster next time. 
Extra Functionality in GIMP via Plugins 
GIMP has many plugins available to do extra things in GIMP such as editing RAW images or 
adding animation functionality. It’s not necessary to add extra plugins. Sometimes a plugin can 
solve a particular task you wish to do in GIMP. This is a beginner’s book so we will first focus on 
getting to know GIMP as it comes out of the box. Chapter 10 covers how to find and install 
plugins.

Summary 
In this chapter you learned how to find and download GIMP 2.8+ for Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
Congratulations if you now have GIMP installed! With GIMP on your computer, you’re ready to 
have some fun with digital editing. If you wish to add extra plugins to GIMP, see Chapter 10. If 
you know how to use Photoshop, Chapter 10 also has some tips and hints about the similarities 
and differences between Photoshop and GIMP.

Is This Chapter for You? 
• 
Yes, if you are new to GIMP. 
• 
Yes, if you have used another image-editing program and are trying out GIMP. If you 
know Photoshop, also look at the Chapter 10 in the “Hints and Tips” section for 
Photoshop comparisons. 
By now you should have GIMP installed on your computer. Congratulations! One of the 
hardest things for most beginners is getting started. The next step, starting to use a new program, 
can be equally daunting. These are the two biggest hurdles for most beginners. For most people, 
once you have completed a couple of tasks in GIMP you will begin to relax and get used to the 
new processes. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
16 
In this chapter, we show you how to open GIMP and give you a tour of GIMP’s tools and 
features. We also show you how to set the workspace to single-window mode, which makes 
finding things easier. The chapter has some quizzes to help you check your progress. Because this 
is a book for beginners, at any one time, you will be using only a couple of options. Importantly 
we will show you clearly where and how to do a task at the time we are discussing the task. We 
don’t expect you to memorize this chapter. This chapter is just to give you a feel for GIMP’s layout 
and its possibilities; you should feel free to come back here at any time. 
Quickest Way to Learn GIMP 
A tip to help you remember where things are in GIMP is to have a problem you want to solve, 
such as how to open and save an image. By the end of this chapter, you should know how to open 
GIMP, how to open an image, and how to see the information GIMP is giving you about your 
image. You should know how to find the toolbox, where the menus are located, and the options 
the menus provide. Finally, you will know where the dialogs or panels are located and have an 
overview of how they can help you. 
Reading or working through this section is the fastest way to use GIMP efficiently—for some 
people. Not everyone learns an activity in the same way. Some people learn by doing, others need 
to get an overview first. If you want to start doing something in GIMP, rather than taking this tour 
of the interface, skip this chapter. You can always come back later. 
Starting GIMP 
GIMP starts the same way as other programs on your computer. If you are not sure, follow the 
directions below for Windows, Apple Mac, or Linux. 
Windows 
To start GIMP in Windows, in the bottom left hand corner of your screen, choose Start ➤ All 
Programs ➤ GIMP. The first time GIMP opens, it will open slowly. GIMP is configuring one-off 
options and directories. Don’t worry; it will open faster next time. 
Mac 
To start GIMP in Mac, go to the Applications folder, scroll down and click on GIMP. GIMP will 
open slowly the first time because it is configuring behind the scenes options and directories. It 
will open faster next time. 
Linux 
GIMP starts the same way as other applications for your distribution. The latest versions of 
Ubuntu do not have GIMP installed. See Chapter1 for installation instructions for Ubuntu. To 
open GIMP, click on Applications, scroll down to Graphics; in the Graphics submenu, click on 
GIMP to open it. See Chapter 1 for full installations details. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
17 
What Version of GIMP Do You Have? 
This book covers GIMP version 2.8. If you don’t know what version of GIMP you have, click on the 
Help menu located at the top of the Image Window (the window with the menus on top), scroll 
down and click About. A small window will open with details about the version of GIMP running 
on your computer. If you have a version older than 2.8, consider updating to 2.8; it’s free and 
worth the effort. Earlier versions of GIMP look a little different and don’t have some of the newest 
features. Using an older version of GIMP will make this book more difficult to follow. See Chapter 
1 to find out how to get the latest version of GIMP. 
GIMP 2.8 Workspace 
GIMP may look strange to you when it opens. Most new programs do seem odd at first. The 
relatively simple-looking windows contain a huge number of useful features and can be 
confusing at first glance. Don’t worry, we will work through it and you’ll learn where to find 
everything. 
When GIMP 2.8 opens, you should see three separate windows, as shown in Figure 2-1. 
• 
The Toolbox window has tools for your projects. 
• 
The Image window is used for editing images and accessing menus. 
• 
The Utility Docking window is available to organize layers, history, color pallets, etc.

Simplifying GIMP’s Workspace 
You may have opened GIMP 2.8 and not been able to see the three windows in Figure 2-1. Don’t 
worry; there is a simple option available to fix this and it’s called single-window mode.  
Single-Window Mode 
We suggest all beginners and people new to GIMP set up single-window mode. Single-window 
mode joins GIMP’s three windows together. This means you will always see a combined 
workspace. This will save you the bother of looking for buried windows, a problem that can occur 
using the three-window workspace default. Figure 2-1 shows GIMP’s three separate windows. 
Compare this with Figure 2-2, which shows GIMP in single-window mode. In single-window 
mode, the Toolbox window, the Image window, and the Utility Docks windows are combined 
into one larger window.

Flexible Workspace 
The walls of the windows in single-window mode are flexible. You can drag on the internal 
divisions to make a window larger or smaller. You can drag on the edges to make the window 
taller or wider. As you start to edit you will find how useful it can be to be able to push the 
workspace around to suit you.

Getting Single-Window Mode 
To change from three separate windows to single-window mode, in the Image window top menu, 
click Windows (see Figure 2-3). A submenu or list of options will open; scroll down with your 
mouse and click ”Single-Window Mode.” 
 
Figure 2-3. Changing to single-window mode via the Image Window menu 
MISSING TOOLBOX WINDOW OR UTILITY DOCKING WINDOW 
If you don’t want to use the single-window mode and prefer to use GIMP as it comes out of the box 
with three separate windows, that’s fine. However, occasionally you may find you have lost your 
Toolbox window or your Utility Docking window. There are ways to get the windows back. 
To view your lost Utilities Docks window, in the Image Window top menu, go to Windows ➤ 
Recently Closed Docks and click “Channels, Paths, Undo” (see Figure 2-4). Channels, Paths, and 
Undo are the default dock windows for GIMP.  
To view your lost Toolbox window, go to Windows ➤ New Toolbox or use the keyboard shortcut 
Control+B (see Figure 2-4). For Mac users the shortcut is Command+B.

Single-Window Mode Screenshots 
The screenshots in this book use the single-window mode because we believe it is the most useful 
mode for new users. In single-window mode, GIMP’s three windows are joined together and stay 
together; this was a much requested feature. If you have decided to stay with the GIMP default of 
three separate windows, it should be easy enough to follow the instructions with the single-
window mode screenshots. 
Quick Quiz 
With GIMP’s workspace visible on your computer screen, answer the following questions.  
1. 
Can you locate GIMP’s Toolbox area? 
2. 
Can you locate the image editing area? 
3. 
Can you locate the utility docking area? 
Don’t worry if you have no idea what these areas do. You need to know where things are 
before you can perform any actions. 
GIMP Workspace Tour 
Before you can do most things in GIMP, it’s essential to know how to create, access, and open a 
image. A blank image is useful for painting and drawing. As a beginner, it’s also useful to have a 
blank image open when you explore the tools in the Toolbox. 
Opening a Blank Image 
1. 
In the top menu, click File (see Figure 2-5). 
2. 
In the drop-down File menu, click New. 
 
Figure 2-5. To open a blank image, go to File ➤ New. 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
22 
3. 
A small dialog called the Create a New Image window pops up (see Figure 2-6). 
 
Figure 2-6. In the Create New Image window, you can choose the size of your blank image. 
4. 
You can keep the height and width of the image at 610  377 pixels, or you can make 
the image larger or smaller by changing the numbers in the Width and Height area (see 
Figure 2-6). 
5. 
For the adventurous, you can click on the Advanced Options and change the 
resolution to 300 pixels per inch. In the Comment area under Advanced Options, you 
can change “Created with GIMP” to “Created by a budding GENIUS.” 
6. 
Click OK. 
Opening a Photo in GIMP 
The image editing area is the place where you open images. The image editing area also contains 
GIMP’s editing menus and more. It is not important what image you choose to open at this stage. 
If you have never opened an image before, images are stored as files. You find images the 
same way you would find a Word document on your computer. 
1. 
To open an image located on your computer, go to the menu bar located at the top of 
the Image window. In the File menu, click Open (see Figure 2-7). 
 
Figure 2-7. To open an image, go to File, scroll down, and click Open. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
23 
2. 
A pop-up menu shows your computer’s folder structure. Search these folders for an 
image and then click Open. See Figure 2-8 for an example of a picture folder. 
Usually images are stored in a Picture folder but you may have stored your images in 
another folder on your computer. Your folder and file system structure will probably 
look different than those in Figure 2-8; basically you are looking for an image on your 
hard drive. When you find an image to open, click Open, as shown in Figure 2-8. 
 
Figure 2-8. Pop-up window in GIMP showing images in a Picture folder located on a hard drive. 
Different computer operating systems will have slightly different ways of displaying files located 
on your hard drive. 
3. 
You should now have an image open in the image editing area. Congratulations if you 
have progressed this far on your own. If you can’t find your images on your computer, 
ask a friend to help you.

Information About Your Image  
When an image is open in GIMP, there is a lot of information about the image available at a 
glance. 
• 
The name of your open image is at the top of the window. In Figure 2-9, the name of 
the image is QuornShow. 
• 
Color mode and Color/Index/Grayscale information is located at the top, next to the 
image name. In Figure 2-9, the color mode is RGB color. Don’t worry if you are new to 
color modes; they are explained in Chapter 3. 
• 
The number of layers the image has shows up at the top of the window. In Figure 2-9, 
QuornShow has one layer. You’ll look at layers in Chapter 6. 
• 
The dimensions of the open image are located at the top of the Image window. In 
Figure 2-9, the image dimensions are 2820  2590 pixels. 
Rulers  
The rulers are located at the top and one side of the image editing area, as you can see in  
Figure 2-9. 
Rulers are useful to 
• 
Understand the exact location of the mouse. 
• 
Create accurate guides. 
• 
Create sample points. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
25 
The default ruler measurement is in pixels. To change the unit of measurement for the rulers 
to other units, go to the drop-down list located on the bottom left of the workspace (see Figure 2-
10). This is useful if you are going to print your image and want to see the size of your current 
image in inches or centimeters.  
Guides 
Guides are movable lines you can place vertically or horizontally over your picture to help line up 
items, visualize changes, etc. To place a guide on your image, drag your mouse from the side or 
top ruler into your image. This action will drag a guide onto the workspace (see Figure 2-10).  
Guides can be handy when drawing or checking to see if the horizon in an image is level. You 
can drag the guide off the screen when not needed. To remove a guide, click the Move Tool and 
drag the guide back to the ruler (see Figure 2-10).

Mouse Coordinates 
Once again, beginners may not need this option but it can be handy if you need to know precisely 
where your mouse is located so you can come back to that spot later. As you move your mouse or 
pointer across your workspace, you can read the exact mouse coordinates near the bottom left 
corner of the window. The units used are the same as for the rulers (see Figure 2-10). 
Zoom 
When GIMP opens your image, it adjusts the view of the image to fit the available space. As you 
work in GIMP you may want to zoom in to see how something looks at 100% or you may want to 
zoom out to see the whole picture on the screen. Zooming in or out on an image doesn’t affect 
the final size of your image. It’s just the view of the image you see on your screen. In the next 
chapter, we show you how to find the exact size of your image. 
To zoom in or out of your image, at the bottom of the window click the tab with the 
percentage value and choose from the drop-down list of sizes (see Figure 2-10). You can also 
enter in a Zoom level in the text box. Some people prefer zooming by clicking on the image and 
using the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Perhaps the easiest way to zoom is to click the 
numbers on your keyboard: 1 = 100%, 2= 200%, etc. In GIMP, there is often more than one way to 
do something. 
Image Resize to Fit Window 
Image Resize is a handy option many people miss. Clicking the Image Resize button will zoom 
the image to fill the editing area. (Your image may already be filling the editing area). If you look 
at the image in Figure 2-10, you can see it is not filling the editing area. Compare this to the image 
in Figure 2-11, which is filling the editing area. Notice that the percentage indicator in the bottom 
of the window lets you know the percentage of the zoom.

RAM Usage, Not File Size 
This is not something that beginners need to worry about but just in case you are curious, GIMP 
tells you at a glance how much RAM you are using. Located at the bottom center of Figure 2-11, is 
the measurement (88.4 MB). This number indicates the amount of computer RAM the image is 
using at that moment. This is not an indication of the file size of the image. We show you in the 
next chapter where to check the size of your image.

Toolbox  
The Toolbox has tools for painting, drawing, and working on photos (see Figure 2-12). It contains 
• 
Selection tools to identify and isolate an area to work on. 
• 
Paint tools to add strokes to your image. 
• 
Transform tools to alter the shape or area of an image. New to GIMP 2.8 is Cage 
Transform. 
• 
Color tools to alter colors across a selection or image. 
• 
Text tools to add text to an image. 
• 
Cloning and healing tools. 
• 
Path tools and reusable shapes, such as the Bezier curve—an advanced option.  
Go to your Toolbox and roll your mouse over a tool. A small description for that tool will  
pop up.  
■ Note If you can’t see the Toolbox on your screen, use the keyboard shortcut Control+B to bring the 
Toolbox in view. For the Mac, use the shortcut Command+B. 
To turn a tool off, click another tool in the Toolbox.

Open a blank image and experiment as you read on. It is probably obvious what the Brush, 
Pen, Ink, and Airbrush Tools do. However, you may not know that apart from a simple brush 
stroke, strokes can be made dynamic. This means the brush or pen responds to the speed you use 
your mouse or graphical tablet’s pen. To turn on brush dynamics, select the brush tool in the 
Toolbox. In Tool Options, located below the Toolbox, click on the icon next to the word 
Dynamics. In the pop-up Dynamics menu, choose Basic Dynamics (see Figure 2-13). The Tool 
Options in the area below the Toolbox change with the selected tool.

Menus in GIMP 
GIMP is a fully featured image editing program. Nowhere is this more evident than when you 
glance through GIMP’s menus. 
All GIMP’s functionality can be accessed via the menu bar located at the top of the window in 
single-window mode. (If you are using GIMP’s three separate windows, the menu bar is located at 
the top of the Image window). 
Glance through the menu screenshots next to get an idea of the possibilities with GIMP. 
Some of the menu items will be obvious. However, the purpose of a number of menu items will 
not be obvious. We don’t expect you to be an expert. When a menu item is needed later in the 
book, we show you when and—more importantly—where a menu item is located. 
File Menu 
The File menu is similar to File menus in many other programs (see Figure 2-14). In the File 
menu, you can 
• 
Open, ccreate, ssave, ssave as, and export images.  
• 
Open recently closed images. 
• 
Create or acquire a screenshot or an image from a camera or scanner. 
• 
Close your images. 
• 
Quit GIMP. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
31 
 
Figure 2-14. The File menu is where you open, save, or export an image. It’s also where you quit or exit 
GIMP. 
Edit Menu 
The Edit menu has some very useful tools for beginners (see Figure 2-15). These are 
• 
Undo or UUndo History removes your last action; the Undo History Tab is useful 
when experimenting. (Control+Z will also undo your last action.) 
• 
Redo restores your last action. (Control+Y will also redo your last action.) 
• 
Cut, copy, and paste. (Control+C to copy and Control+V to paste; for Mac users, it is 
Command+C to copy and Command+V to paste) 
• 
Preferences for GIMP are extensive and include boosting performance, setting up a 
graphics tablet, customizing the workspace, etc. Suggested preferences for beginners 
are in Chapter 10. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
32 
 
Figure 2-15. The Edit menu 
It is worth trying Undo and Redo by going to Edit ➤ Undo. (Control+Z will also undo an 
action.)  
Try also copy and paste. First, use a Tool from the Toolbox to select an area on an image, 
then go to Edit ➤ Copy, and then Edit ➤ Paste to paste it somewhere else on your image. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
33 
Select Menu 
Many of the items in the Select menu are used on selected areas of an image (see Figure 2-16). 
• 
All selects the whole image. 
• 
None is useful when you wish to remove a selection. 
• 
Invert reverses the current selection. Everything that was outside the selection is now 
included and vice versa. 
• 
Float is a temporary layer; use a separate layer instead. Attach a floating layer to a 
layer before any editing can continue (Control-H). We explain this in full in Chapter 6. 
• 
Feather softens a selection at its edges by blending into the surrounding pixels. You 
can choose how many pixels to feather. 
 
Figure 2-16. The Select menu 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
34 
View Menu 
For beginners, the View menu (Figure 2-17) offers a number of useful ways to view your image. 
• 
New View makes another copy of your current image. This new view can be zoomed 
in or out. All editing affects both viewing copies. This is helpful when you are working 
on details in an image and at the same time need an overview of the image. Digital 
painters use this feature. 
• 
Dot for Dot is useful for images for the web only. Please disable Dot for Dot for 
images intended for printing. You will see the images at their true size. 
• 
Zoom gives options for zooming. 
• 
Show Grid is a grid that will overlay your image. Use the grid to line up image 
elements. 
• 
Snap to Grid works like a magnet. It is useful when lining up picture elements. 
 
Figure 2-17. The View menu provides a range of ways to view images and options for showing rulers, guides, 
and selections. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
35 
Image Menu 
The purpose of the Image menu (Figure 2-18) is to let you make some permanent decisions about 
your image. 
• 
Duplicate makes an exact copy of your current image, including all layers, channels, 
and paths (the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl-D). Editing the duplicate image will not affect 
the original image. 
• 
Mode changes the color mode of the image. Images in GIMP are RGB by default but it 
is possible to change the mode to Grayscale mode or Indexed color. An image with 
Indexed color only contains a limited set of colors and can be useful for graphics. The 
safest thing for beginners is to use RGB color. 
• 
Transform will flip, rotate, or guillotine based on image guides. 
• 
Canvas Size allows you to create extra space outside the image. This can be useful if 
you want to add text outside your image. 
• 
Print Size allows you to change the resolution and dimensions of an image.  
• 
Scale Image changes the number of pixels an image contains. Scaling up (making an 
image larger) loses quality. 
• 
Flatten Image merges all layers. There is much more about layers and their uses in 
Chapter 6. 
 
Figure 2-18. The Image menu 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
36 
Layer Menu 
You can skip this menu for now; layers are covered in Chapter 6. You will use layers when you add 
another image to your image, add text, create a montage, etc. However, if you’re curious, the 
Layer menu contains layer management tools (see Figure 2-19).  
• 
New Layer adds a new empty layer to your image, just above the active layer. 
• 
Duplicate Layer adds a new layer, which is an exact copy of the active layer. 
• 
Delete Layer deletes the active layer. 
• 
Stack offers options to reorganize the layer order. 
• 
Mask offers options to create, select, and apply a mask. 
 
Figure 2-19. The Layer menu is only useful when working with layers. Chapter 6 explains the uses for layers. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
37 
Colors Menu 
This area manages color. It has a range of tools to add snap and zing to images and drawings (see 
Figure 2-20). As beginners, you will learn how to use this menu when you work on optimizing or 
getting the best out of your images. Chapter 5 uses some of the options in the Colors menu for 
photographs. We also look at this menu in the chapters on drawing and painting. 
• 
Color Balance increases or decreases the amount of cyan, magenta, or yellow in your 
image. 
• 
Hue-Saturation is sliding scale to optimize the hue and saturation of your image. 
• 
Levels controls shadows, midtones, and highlights in an image. 
• 
Curves is a tool to change the color, brightness, and contrast of an image. Curves can 
bring life to a photo. 
 
Figure 2-20. The Colors menu 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
38 
Tools Menu 
Most of the tools listed in this menu are also available from the Toolbox window located on the 
left of your screen in single-window mode. If you lose your Toolbox, press Ctrl+B and it will come 
to the top of your desktop. Alternatively, choose the tool from the Tools menu (see Figure 2-21). 
The letters opposite the Tool names in the menu are the keyboard shortcuts to select a tool. 
 
Figure 2-21. The Tools menu provides an alternative way of selecting items usually accessed from the 
Toolbox. This can be useful if you have closed the Toolbox to create more screen space. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
39 
Filters Menu 
The filter section is one of the largest areas in GIMP (see Figure 2-22). You could spend days 
experimenting on your photos or drawings with the various filters here. In later chapters, we will 
work with filters.  
The EEnhance filters are important for beginners. These filters help improve imperfections of 
an original image such as lack of sharpness. The very useful but unhelpfully named Unsharp 
Mask is located at Filters ➤ Enhance ➤ Unsharp Mask. 
The filters in this menu are available for the whole image, a layer, or a selection inside an 
image. How and when filters are applied is an individual choice. Open an image and try some of 
the filters. You will be amazed to see how much they can change your image. 
 
Figure 2-22. The Filters menu 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
40 
Windows Menu 
The Windows menu gives you access to a large range of dialogs or panels available in the 
Dockable Dialogs submenu (see Figure 2-23).  
• 
Dockable Dialogs or Dockable Panels contain Layers, Undo, Paths, Brushes, Pallets, 
Gradients, and Fonts.  
• 
Single-Window Mode is new to GIMP 2.8+. Scrolling down the Windows menu and 
clicking on “Single-Window Mode” joins the three separate GIMP windows together 
(it joins the Toolbox to the Image window and the Dialog or Panels window). If you 
are new to GIMP, we strongly recommend you try single-window mode. It makes it 
easier for you to remember where items are located. 
 
Figure 2-23. The Windows menu 

CHAPTER 2 ■ GETTING TO KNOW THE GIMP WORKSPACE 
41 
Help Menu 
The Help menu (Figure 2-24) offers additional resources and information. 
• 
GIMP Online links to several GIMP web sites that provide additional free 
documentation and useful resources for users and developers. It is possible to 
download the Help and run it from your desktop. 
• 
About offers information about the version of GIMP you have on your computer. 
 
Figure 2-24. The Help menu 
Alternative Ways to Access Menu Items 
In GIMP, there is often more than one way to access a tool or an option. In the top menu bar you 
can access all the Toolbox tools when you click on Tools. The tools are also available in the 
Toolbox. To access the top menu bar items another way, right click with your mouse on the 
Image window screen and the main menu list appears.

Quick Quiz 
1. 
How do you undo your last action? 
2. 
Is Dot for Dot used for screen or print images? 
3. 
Where are the image sharpening tools located? 
4. 
What menu do you use to add a layer to an image? 
Dockable Dialogs or Dockable Panels 
GIMP offers dockable dialogs. But what is a dockable dialog? A dialog is a small box or window 
with a number of options available for the current tool or image such as a brush. In single-
window mode, the dialogs are located on the right hand side of the screen.  
The most useful dialog or panel for new users is the Undo History. 
In other photo and image editing software, dialog docks are referred to as panels. There are a 
number of other dialogs or panels for Layers, Channels, etc. When GIMP first opens, on the right 
of your screen, you can see the Layers dialog and below this, the Brushes dialog (see Figure 2-25). 
There are many more dialogs out of sight.  
(Each of the dialogs or panels can be dragged around the workspace to suit your needs. This 
option is really for experienced users. It is not useful to move dialogs around before you are 
comfortable with the whole GIMP workspace.) 
Undo History—Great for Beginners 
The Undo History is by far one of the most useful dialogs or panels for beginners. On the top far 
right of your screen, click on the curved yellow arrow to reveal your undo history. If you can’t see 
the yellow arrow, drag the far right edge of your workspace to reveal the area. 
In Figure 2-25, Undo History is selected and you should be able to see a four-step rough 
drawing of an eye. Clicking on any of those steps will undo that image to that point. 
 
Figure 2-25. Clicking on the yellow curved arrow opens the Undo History area.

Summary 
This chapter was a tour through GIMP’s workspace. We looked at GIMP’s three workspace 
windows: the Toolbox, the Image window, and the Dockable Dialogs window. To make things 
easier to find, we joined these three windows into single-window mode. You saw how to open an 
image and view the information available at a glance about that image. We listed and explored 
some of the Tools in the Toolbox. We toured through the menu area. In the Dockable Dialogs 
area, we looked at dialogs and how to find the Undo History area. We included four quizzes to 
help you move through this material.

Preparing Images for Printing 
Digital images appear in advertisements, in newspapers, magazines, the Internet and on 
television. The relatively low cost of digital imaging  has enabled more and more people to 
explore their creativity via digital art. It has been possible for some time to print your digital 
images or upload them to the Internet. Now your digital images can go onto business cards, 
calendars, clothing, drink coasters, flags, flyers, key rings, logos, mouse mats, mugs, newsletters, 
placemats, rulers etc. The places where images appear seems to grow each year, no space is too 
small, too large or too obscure.  
It is possible to download photos from your digital camera and have them printed to your 
medium immediately. However, there comes a time for many people when they want more 
control over the look of their images. GIMP gives you control over the size, shape and exposure of 
an image. It allows you to add text, other images or parts of an image and many other creative 
concepts. In fact, you probably feel like jumping to a later chapter and doing something creative 
right now. If you are a beginner, please answer these questions first. Do you know what digital 
resolution is? Do you know when to use low resolution images and when to use high resolution 
images? Do you know the most appropriate file type for your digital project? Do you know how to 
save an image in GIMP? If you are not sure about any of these questions, keep reading this

Choosing the correct file format for your image is one of the most important things you can do to 
ensure your image displays well and is available, in good condition, for future reuse. 
GIMP works with a large number of image file formats. Here is a list of the most common file 
formats available in GIMP.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
46 
Suggested File Types for Beginners 
For beginners and those in a hurry, you can get by using two file types, XCF and JPG. Save the 
work you are editing as an XCF file. When you have finished editing, export your image as a JPG. 
It is worth noting that GIMP saves files by default to the XCF file format. This is a good thing 
because your image is saved to a format which helps you avoid some errors beginners often 
make. To save an image to another file format the image is exported. We explain the simple 
procedure for exporting images later in this chapter. 
Why not save the file as a JPG and forget about XCF you may say. Read the paragraph on JPG 
below, to find out why that is not a good idea. 
JPG 
JPG or JPEG is a very popular format for images. If you are downloading files from your camera or 
phone, your image files most likely have .jpg at the end of them. JPG images get compressed in 
the camera to reduce the file size.  
It is a very good idea to make a copy of your JPG image before you start editing. Many people 
do not realize that each time a JPG image is saved there will be some loss of quality. This loss of 
quality is permanent.  
JPG files are ideal to use on the Internet because it is possible to reduce the file size of a JPG 
when you are saving an image. Smaller files sizes make web pages open faster. Later this chapter 
explains how to save (Export) a JPG image. 
Some beginners compromise on quality by choosing a camera setting which allows the 
largest number of JPG images for their card. Once information is reduced in size, it gives little 
room to move when you may want to tweak your colors or contrast in image editing software. 
GIF 
GIF is a low quality file format used for graphics with very few colors (256 colors). GIF can be 
useful for simple animation on the web. A better choice for web graphics is PNG. 
PNG 
PNG (Portable Network Graphic) replaces the GIF file format for graphics on the web. Why is 
PNG better than GIF?  PNG supports a greater range of transparency and handles a much larger 
range of colors. PNG has better file compression than GIF. However, PNG does not support 
animation.  
PSD  
GIMP can open and save Photoshop PSD files. It is possible to edit each layer separately in GIMP, 
save it as a PSD and then open it in Photoshop. However, PSD images opened in GIMP that have 
had Adjustment Layers applied to them in Photoshop will not show up in GIMP. A PSD image 
created in GIMP will open in Photoshop without problems. PSD is comparable in complexity to 
XCF the native file format for GIMP.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
47 
RAW  
RAW files are available from higher end digital cameras. RAW files are larger than JPG files 
because they contain a lot more information about your image. The advantage of RAW files 
(unlike JPG files) is that the image is preserved in an uncompressed format. RAW files give you a 
greater control over the dynamic range of your image, that is the range from the brightest part of 
the image to the darkest part of the image. White Balance can be changed in a RAW image. RAW 
files also contain the Meta Data belonging to the image. Meta Data includes such things as the 
time and date the image was taken, the camera make and model, the camera settings such as the 
F stop and speed and if available it will also record the GPS location. 
In GIMP for  MAC, RAW files open via an already installed plugin called UFRaw. Windows 
users will need to install the UFRaw Plugin (see Chapter 10) or convert RAW files to TIF before 
opening them in GIMP. Linux users may have to also install UFRaw to open RAW files.  
Once a RAW file is opened in GIMP it cannot be saved back as a RAW file. Once a RAW image 
has been worked on in GIMP it can be exported as a JPG for web or printing work. If 
saving/exporting to JPG make sure the quality is set to high. An opened RAW file can be exported 
as a TIF, this can be a good option if you are working with large file sizes for images to be printed. 
If you hit Save in GIMP the RAW file will be saved as an XCF file. This is a good option if you 
intend to do more work on the image.    
TIF 
TIF (Tagged Image File Format) is a high quality format. TIF files are larger than JPG files. TIF use 
a lossless compression format. This means if you save a few times, while working on the image, it 
does not lose quality. TIF is a popular file format for printing, scanning and archiving images.  
XCF 
XCF  is  the GIMP native file format. This  format stores all of the data making up your image. XCF 
saves your image layers, guides, transparency, paths and active channels and meta data. This file 
format is the recommended file format to use in GIMP when editing your images.  
XCF files are for use within GIMP only. When you have finished editing an image, the final 
step is to export (save) the image to another file format. You can export an XCF image to a JPG for 
the web or TIF for printing or to any of the other file formats supported in GIMP. Exporting is 
explained later in this chapter. 
This format does not save your Undo History. No file format saves your undo history in 
GIMP. Save progressive versions of your image if you think you may need to roll back to an earlier 
state.

■ Tip To improve the quality of your digital images, check your digital camera manual, to see if your 
camera can take RAW images. A RAW image contains all the digital metadata about the image. GIMP can 
open RAW image with the aid of a Plugin called UFRaw. For example, there is the ability to change the 
white balance, to increase the dynamic range or to recover better from an overly dark or overly bright 
image. RAW files are larger than JPG files. 
Zooming in GIMP 
The size of the image you see on your computer screen does not necessary mean that is the actual 
size of the image. Check that you are zoomed at 100%. Zoom changes your view of the image on 
your screen.  
There are many ways to zoom in GIMP: 
• 
Zoom by typing these numbers on your keyboard: 1 to zoom 100%, 2 to zoom 200%, 3 
to zoom 400%, 4 to zoom 800%. 
• 
Zoom via the menu options in View ➤ Zoom. 
• 
Zoom using the Magnifying Tool located in the Tool Box. 
• 
Zoom via the pull-down menu at the bottom edge of the workspace window. 
• 
Keyboard Shortcuts for Zooming: 
• 
Fit Image in Window Shift +Ctrl+E 
• 
Zoom In + 
• 
Zoom Out – 
When editing a digital image it is a good practice to zoom to 100% or greater. This is 
particularly useful if you are editing a small area of an image. 
Image Basics 
It is sensible to start digital editing with some good work practices. Beginners often disregard any 
thought about image resolution until it bites them. For example, a beginner may have an image 
uploaded to a website and people have commented favorably about the image. One day the 
beginner decides to make a very large print of this image and hang it on a wall. They are horrified 
to see that the printed image is fuzzy. It is not good enough to hang on a wall. Why did this 
happen? The short answer is the only copy of the image was optimized for the Internet. We will 
guide you to avoid disasters like this. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
49 
Make a Copy of Your Image 
Before you start editing an image, we recommend you work on a copy of your original image. 
There are a few reasons for this. 
• 
You might make a mistake and ruin your only copy 
• 
You might make your only copy smaller to fit on a web page. Thus making the only 
copy of your image, smaller and lesser in quality 
• 
Opening, editing and saving a JPG image many times will deteriorate the quality of the 
image. 
• 
Disk space is relatively cheap compared to going back and taking that special photo 
again.  
The easiest way to make another copy of your image is save it as an XCF file. XCF is GIMP’s 
high quality native file format. This means you keep the same name as the original but it has a 
different file ending. For example, myimage.jpg could be the original and myimage.xcf. could be 
the copy of the original. 
Save Your Work 
Don’t forget to save as your work as you go, rather than at the end of the entire editing process. 
Save your working copy in GIMP’s native file format .xcf. The .xcf file retains quality, and 
preserves layers, if you are using them. When the editing is complete, you can save the image as a 
JPG or TIF or the recommended file for your project. Some people protest that saving images as 
.xcf files, uses too much disk space. We are recommending this only for the images you do 
extensive work on not for every image you own. If you have invested an hour or so editing a 
special image, we think you should retain the best quality for that image. 
Save Your Image as an XCF File 
Saving your image as an XCF file, preserves quality as you work on your image. You have the 
choice later to export the image to a JPG or any other image file type.  
1. 
Open an image in GIMP by going to File ➤ Open, see Figure 3-1.(see Chapter 2 if you 
are unsure)

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
51 
What Is Image Resolution?  
When taking photos, choose the highest resolution your camera will allow. This will give you the 
best quality and the biggest file size. You can always reduce the size of the image later. 
So what is image resolution? Digital images have thousands and thousands of tiny pixels. 
Figure 3-3 shows pixels enlarged many times, normally you cannot see the actual pixels. The 
number of pixels per inch (ppi) determines resolution. In other words, the resolution is the 
number of pixels along the width and height of an image. The more pixels packed together per 
inch the higher the resolution, similarly the fewer pixels per inch the lower the resolution. 
When you edit an image in GIMP or any other digital image editor, you are editing pixels. 
Pixels are tiny elements storing variations of brightness and color. The word pixel is an 
amalgamation of the words picture and element. GIMP edits pixels by coloring, shading, 
counting, selecting, moving, blending or removing pixels. 
 
Figure 3-3. An extreme close up of individual pixels 
■ Note For geeks only, the digital images GIMP edits are raster images. Raster images are made up of  
pixels. Another type of digital image is the vector image. Vector images use geometrical points, lines and 
curves to represent images. GIMP can open a vector image and export it as a raster image but GIMP 
cannot export the image as a vector image. The one exception is that GIMP Paths can export to SVG, which 
is a vector graphics format. If you are looking for an open source vector image editor, try Inkscape. 
It is difficult to see the individual pixels in the image in Figure 3-4, because the resolution is 
high. The blossom image has a resolution of 300ppi. Its pixel measurements are 1056  755 pixels 
or 804,075 pixels. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
52 
 
Figure 3-4. This image has a high resolution of 300 ppi (pixels per inch) 
■ Note Image Resolution is measured in ppi. The term ppi stands for the number of pixels per inch. An 
image with 300ppi is a high resolution image. An image with 72ppi is a low resolution image.  
You may hear people refer to dpi – this stands for dots per inch. dpi refers to the resolution of a printer. A 
printer with a resolution of 1200 dpi should print good copies of images saved at 300ppi. A printer with a 
resolution of 400dpi would give a less satisfactory result. The reason being a printer printing 1200dpi is 
printing many more dots per inch compared to a printer with a resolution of 400dpi which is only printing 
400 dots per inch. 
Comparing Image Resolution  
Figure 3-5, has two versions of the same image. However, the images have different resolutions. 
The image on the left in Figure 3-5 has a resolution of 300 ppi. This is a high resolution image. 
The image on the right in Figure 3-5 has a resolution of 72 ppi. Although the image on the right 
has a poorer quality on the printed page, on a computer screen it would appear normal. Images 
for the web will load faster the smaller the file size. An image with a low resolution will have a 
smaller file size than the same image with a high resolution.

Figures 3-5a and 3-5b. The image  on the left has a resolution of 300 ppi and a file size of 1 MB. The image on 
the right has been scaled to a resolution of 72 ppi and a file size of 50 KB. 
Quick Quiz

What does ppi stand for? 
2. 
What resolution should you save an image for the Internet?  
3. 
What resolution should you save an image to be printed? 
Checking Image Resolution in GIMP 
As mentioned, an image with a high resolution will have more pixels than a low resolution image 
with the same height and width. 
To check the resolution of your image: 
1. 
In the top menu, go to File ➤ Open. (for further information on opening an image, see 
Chapter 2). 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
54 
2. 
To see the image resolution and other properties for your image in GIMP, go to the 
Image Menu ➤ Image Properties. See Figure 3-6. Scroll down and click on Image 
Properties at the bottom of the list, as shown in Figure 3-6. 
 
Figure 3-6. On the left, Image Properties is selected, on the right the pop-up Image Properties 
dialog showing a resolution of 72 ppi and other information about the image 
3. 
A pop-up panel or screen will appear showing the image properties for the open 
image. See the Image Properties dialog on the right in Figure 3-6. 
Resolution for Printed Images 
Printed images need a high resolution, 300 ppi is a recommended resolution for printed images. 
When you change the image resolution, the following occurs:  
• 
Decreasing the resolution means the width and height of an image increases. This 
happens because you are assigning fewer pixels per inch so the images expands in 
size. 
• 
Increasing the resolution, means the width and height of an image decreases. This is 
because you are squeezing in more pixels in per inch.  
When saving (File ➤ Export in GIMP) an image for printing, choose a resolution of 300 ppi. 
Export the image as a TIF file. TIF files are a high quality option. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS

To Increase or Decrease Resolution 
To change the resolution of your image: 
1. 
Go to the top menu click on the Image menu and scroll down and click on Print Size. 
See Figure 3-7. 
2. 
In the pop-up Set Image Print Resolution dialog, in the resolution box change the 
resolution, then click OK. 
 
Figure 3-7. To change the resolution go to Image ➤ Print Size and change the resolution in the 
Set Image Print Resolution dialog 
Saving a JPG, PNG, PSD, and TIF File in GIMP 
Unlike most software programs GIMP 2.8 saves most image files via the File ➤ Export Menu not 
File ➤ Save. File ➤ Save is only used for GIMP’s native file format XCF. 
Saving Files in GIMP via the File ➤ Export Menu 
To save a JPG, PNG, PSD, TIF or other file in GIMP: 
1. 
Click on the File menu. 
2. 
Scroll down and click on Export. See Figure 3-8. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ BASIC COMPUTER GRAPHICS

3. 
In the Export Image window, check the correct name for your file. See Figure 3-9. 
4. 
In the Export Image window, choose a folder to save your image. Either choose a folder 
from the folders shown in the ‘Save in folder’ drop down list. Alternatively, browse for 
the correct folder by clicking on the + next to Browse for other folders. See Figure 3-9. 
5. 
Choose a file by clicking on the small arrow next to Select File_Type (By Extension). 
See Figure 3-9.

10. Then Click on Export 
If you intend to upload your image to a website such as eBay or the photographic website 
Flickr, take a note of your file size. If your file is smaller than 5MB, you image will up load ok. 
Flickr can take files up to 10MB. If however your file size is larger than this or you need your 
image as part of a web design, move onto the next example to reduce your file size further. 
Saving (Exporting) and Reducing JPG File Size 
The difference between this and the last exporting task is that we reduce the file size further. This 
is done by taking an extra step in the Export process. 
To save or (export) an image: 
1. 
Go to the File ➤ Export menu.( If you are unsure refer to Figure 3-8). 
2. 
The Export Image window opens. See Figure 3-11. 
3. 
Type the name for your file, in the Name area, see Figure 3-11. 
4. 
Select a folder to save your image in. 
5. 
Choose a file type by clicking on the the small arrow next to Select File_Type (By 
Extension). See Figure 3-11.

In the pop-up ‘Export my Image as a JPG’ window, click the checkbox next to ‘Show 
preview in image window’. This allows you to see the effects on your image of reducing 
the file size. See Figure 3-13. 
8. 
Make sure you are viewing your image at 100% (Press the number 1 on your keyboard 
to zoom to 100%).  
9. 
Use the Quality slider in the Pop-up window, Export Image as JPEG, to reduce the file 
size of your image, see Figure 3-13. 
10. Click on Export in the pop-up window when you are happy with the file size and the 
look of the image.

the file size of your image. 
Once you have exported an image in GIMP, you can use Control E to update the file. GIMP 
remembers where you exported the file. Alternatively, you can go to File ➤ Export As to update 
the image. 
■ Caution Settings in GIMP such as Zoom and Dot for Dot changes your view of an image on your screen 
it is not permanent. To permanently change the size of an image, the image is scaled in the Image ➤ Scale 
Image menu. Disable Dot for Dot by going to the View menu and unchecking Dot for Dot. 
Summary 
We highlighted some traps for beginners when they start saving images. We discussed the 
importance of image resolution and file size in determining the successful outcome of a digital 
project. The major image file types were discussed to help choose the best file type for your 
project. We showed you the slightly quirky way to save images in GIMP. With some sensible basic 
information under your belt, it is now time to edit your images.

■ Tip Saving Files Is Slightly Different in GIMP. An unusual design feature of GIMP 2.8 is that only GIMP’s 
native file XCF is saved via File ➤ Save. File formats (such as JPG, TIF, PNG, PSD, etc.) are saved by going 
to File ➤ Export. See Chapter 3 for further details. 
Image Opens Upside Down 
From time to time an image may open upside down in GIMP. For example, an image might 
appear upside down if it was scanned that way.

■ Tip The screenshots in this book use GIMP‘s single-window mode. We recommend single-window 
mode for beginners as it joins the three workspaces together. To move to single-window mode, in the top 
menu go to Windows ➤ Single-Window Mode. Further details are in Chapter 2. 
Cropping an Image 
Often the only improvement a photo needs is a little cropping. When you crop a photo, you are 
removing some of the original edges from the photo. Cropping is useful to remove distracting 
items and to make the photo more artistic or pleasing. Cropping an image can sometimes turn an 
ordinary image into something special. No matter what the reason, if you are unhappy with the 
framing of your image, one solution is to use the GIMP Crop Tool.  
Before cropping, make a copy of your image by saving or exporting the image (see Chapter 2 
if you need a refresher). Decide before you crop how you are going to use this image (print or web 
site), then set the correct resolution. (See Chapter 3 for further information about setting the 
correct resolution for your image). 
Basic Crop 
In this example, you can select any part of your image to crop. This means the image will change 
its shape and dimensions. If you need to crop to a specific width or to an aspect ratio, move on to 
the next exercise. 
1. 
Select the Crop Tool in the Toolbox (see Figure 4-8). The Crop Tool is located in the 
Toolbox on the left of the screen if you are in single-window mode. If you have the 
default layout and can’t see the Toolbox, use the keyboard shortcut Control+B to bring 
up the Toolbox. 
2. 
To help decide where to crop, use Golden sections from the drop-down list. (see Figure 
4-8) The Golden sections will display over your image when you select the photo with 
your mouse. (Golden sections are a variation on a long-standing photographic idea, 
the rule of thirds. The guide divides a photo horizontally and vertically into thirds. 
Some people say the eye more naturally goes to points of interest located in these 
divisions rather than the center of an image.)  
3. 
To start selecting, drag the mouse diagonally across the image. 
4. 
To align the crop selection more accurately, the selected area has a square box in each 
corner of the selection. Drag the mouse inside any of those square borders to make 
your crop selection larger or smaller (see Figure 4-8). 
5. 
To crop the image, press Enter. Figure 4-9 shows the result.

■ Note Have you ever noticed that the framing of your image does not always turn out the way you 
expected?  If you use a point-and-shoot camera, the framing of the scene you see in the camera is not 
accurate. Viewfinders in point-and-shoot cameras give an approximation of the framing of the image you 
are taking. The viewfinder is usually located above and to one side of the lens. In contrast, DSLR cameras 
have through-the-lens viewing so it’s much easier to frame a shot. 
Cropping to an Aspect Ratio  
The aspect ratio is the relationship between the length and width of an image. In the excitement 
to work on a photo, it is easy to overlook the fact that the aspect ratio of your image may be 
different from the aspect ratio where your edited image will be displayed. You may display your 
images on a screen, a digital photo frame, or as a printed photograph. Each of these display 
media has aspect ratios that may be different from the aspect ratio of your image. These 
discrepancies are described in the following two sections. The instructions for cropping to an 
aspect ratio follow these sections.  
Displaying Images in a Digital Photo Frame 
If you display your images in a digital photo frame, the frame may have a different aspect ratio 
from your camera’s aspect ratio. If the aspect ratios don’t match, your digital photo frame might 
compensate in ways that might not be visually pleasing. The digital photo frame may crop your 
image automatically, thereby cutting off vital parts of the picture. It may stretch your image to fit 
the frame, thus distorting your image or it may have a black line down two sides of your image. 
Check the Photo Size before Printing 
The aspect ratio of an image produced by a camera doesn’t match the aspect ratio of most photo 
paper. This absolute silliness was the case in the film camera days and is still the case today. In 
simple terms, the image produced by your camera has a different width-to-height ratio than most 
photo paper. 
If you are printing an image, it makes sense to crop your image to the same aspect ratio as 
the paper the photo is printed on. If you don’t crop or resize your image, the image is usually 
cropped automatically in the printing process. This might not be a pleasant surprise. An 
Australian friend of ours worked on her European holiday images in a digital editor. To her 
horror, when the images were printed, important parts of many images were cropped out in the 
printing process. She did not know why this had happened and was very upset. No one had told 
her to check the paper sizes in use at the printing shop.  
■ Tip When printing your images, set your resolution to 300 ppi. See Chapter 3 for more details.

Cropping to an Aspect Ratio in GIMP 
There may be times when you need to crop an image to a specific ratio. For example, a ratio of 6:4 
is a common size for small printed photos. 
1. 
Select the Crop Tool in the Toolbox (see Figure 4-10). The Crop Tool is located in the 
Toolbox on the left of the screen if you are in single-window mode. If you can’t see the 
Toolbox, use the keyboard shortcut Control+B to bring up the Toolbox.  
2. 
The Crop Tool has a Tool Options box that is located below the Toolbox.  
3. 
Choose Aspect ratio from the drop-down list next to the checkbox.  
4. 
In the Tool Options, select “Fixed” next to Aspect ratio. 
5. 
Type in the Aspect ratio you need. (The example in Figure 4-10 has a ratio of 6:4.) 
6. 
To start the selection process, drag the mouse diagonally across the image. (This can 
be an approximate selection.) 
7. 
To align the crop selection more accurately, the selected area has a square box in each 
corner of the selection. Drag the mouse inside any of those square borders to make 
your crop selection larger or smaller. 
8. 
To crop the image, press Enter. Figure 4-11 shows the result.

Cropping to a Width or Height 
GIMP’s cropping tool also allows cropping to a specific width or height. To crop to a specific 
width or height, follow the last exercise until the end of step 2. Then choose either the height or 
width from the drop down list next to aspect ratio. (See Figure 4-10.) Type the height or width in 
the box, then continue from step 6. 
Changing the Size of an Image 
You may need to change the size or dimensions of an image, perhaps for a web site or for 
printing. It is possible to scale an image smaller or larger. Scaling an image down in size usually 
doesn’t affect the quality of the image. Making an image larger than the original can affect image 
quality. It is a good practice to make a copy of your image before scaling. When you have saved 
(or exported) your scaled image, the change is permanent. 
The Scale Image option in GIMP allows you to make an image smaller or larger. You can 
scale your image by one of the following units: 
• 
Pixels 
• 
Percentage 
• 
Inches 
• 
Millimeters 
• 
Points 
• 
Pica 

CHAPTER 4 ■ IMAGE STRAIGHTENING, CROPPING, SCALING, AND PERSPECTIVE 
75 
For the following exercises, we suggest you avoid using the scale tool in the Toolbox. This 
example uses the Scale Image option located in the Image menu (Image ➤ Scale Image). There is 
often more than one way of doing things in GIMP. We show the most useful tools, rather than 
every possible way to do a task. 
■ Tip Scaling is quite different from zooming. When you zoom in or out of an image on your screen, this 
just affects the view you see on the screen. Zoom does not permanently change your image size. Scaling 
changes your image permanently to another size.  
Making an Image Larger 
If you make an image larger (in other words, if you scale up an image), there may be some loss of 
quality to the image in the process. The amount of loss of quality when enlarging depends on the 
quality of the image and the amount of the enlarging. When enlarging an image, the interpolation 
tool adds extra pixels. 
GIMP’s Scale Image area sets the size of any image you open at 100%. To double an image in 
size, choose 200%. Experiment with different percentages to see what works for your image.  
To make an image larger or to scale up an image, follow these steps: 
1. 
Go to Image ➤ Scale Image (see Figure 4-12). 
 
Figure 4-12. Choose Scale Image from the Image menu 
2. 
In the pop-up window, choose a percentage value greater than 100% to enlarge your 
image (see Figure 4-13). Alternatively, you can scale up your image by choosing from 
the drop-down list one of the following measurements: pixels, inches, millimeters, 
points, or pica. Then type into the Width area the size you need. 
3. 
Click the adjacent chain link (see Figure 4-13). This retains the images original 
proportions. 
4. 
For the method of scaling or interpolation, try Cubic or Sinc (Lanzcos3).  
5. 
Click Scale. The image will scale up 200%. 
Figure 4-14 is a photo of a computer fan before scaling up in GIMP. Figure 4-15 shows the 
computer fan after scaling up 200%.

Making an Image Smaller 
GIMP’s Scale Image option can also scale images down in size. Choose one of the following units 
to scale your image: 
• 
Pixels 
• 
Percentage 
• 
Inches 
• 
Millimeters 
• 
Points 
• 
Pica 
There is a Scale Tool in the Toolbox. However, for these exercises, as mentioned earlier, we 
are using the Scale Image option located in the Image menu (Image ➤ Scale Image). The Scale 
Image option also has an area to change the resolution of an image. 
1. 
Go to the Scale Image option located in the Image menu, as shown in Figure 4-16.  
 
Figure 4-16. To make an image smaller, go to Image ➤ Scale Image. 
2. 
In the pop-up window, choose pixel from the drop-down list near Width and Height, 
and type in the pixel width for your image (see Figure 4-17). Alternatively, you can 
scale down your image by choosing an option from the drop-down list. 
1377 pixels original width
800 pixels scaled down width
Choose a scaling option from
the drop down list
 
Figure 4-17. To scale down the image for a web site, pixels were chosen from the drop-down list.

3. 
Click the chain link located next to Width and Height; this retains the correct 
proportions. 
4. 
For the method of scaling or interpolation, try Cubic or Sinc (Lanzcos3).  
5. 
Click Scale. 
See Figures 4-18 and 4-19 for a before and after scaling example.

Fixing Perspective: Leaning Buildings 
GIMP has a powerful Perspective Tool. Use the Perspective Tool to correct a photo that has 
leaning buildings or towers or power poles etc. (see Figures 4-20 and 4-21)

been cropped. 
The following exercise shows you how to straighten an image. Once you have completed the 
exercise, feel free try different options in the tool.  
To straighten a leaning building, follow these steps: 
1. 
Open your image in GIMP. 
2. 
Click on the Perspective Tool located in the Toolbox (see Figure 4-22). 
3. 
Below the Toolbox are the Tool Options for the Perspective Tool. Select the following 
Tool Options (see Figure 4-22):

Click on the image to activate the Perspective Tool. A grid will appear over the image 
and a pop-up dialog box will appear, as shown in Figure 4-22. Move the dialog box off 
the image so you can see what you are doing. 
5. 
Move the grid with your mouse, so that it lines up with vertical lines on your image.  
6. 
Click on Transform in the dialog box. If you’re not happy with the result, you can go 
back a step in your Undo History or click Control+Z on your keyboard.

7. 
Your image will have a hatched border down two sides (see Figure 4-23). This is 
because “Crop to result” was selected to give your image clean, straight edges.  
8. 
To remove this blank space, go to Image ➤ Autocrop Image (Figure 4-24). 
 
Figure 4-23. After the Transform, and with “Crop to result” selected, the image has a blank or 
transparent edge on two sides.

To save your image, go to File ➤ Export and save your image as a JPG or TIF. Or click 
File ➤ Save to save your image in GIMP’s native file format which is XCF.  
Framing an Image 
Adding a border to your image in GIMP is easy. Framing effects and other options are located in 
the Filters ➤ Decor menu. Figure 4-25 shows an example of the Border option. Figure 4-26 shows 
an example of the Round Corners option and the Slide border option. 
 
Figure 4-25. The image on the left has no border; the image on the right has a border. 
 
Figure 4-26. The image on left has round corners and the image on right has GIMP’s Slide option. 
To add a frame, follow these steps: 
1. 
Open an image in GIMP. 
2. 
Go to Filters ➤ Decor and choose a border type from the menu (see Figure 4-27).  
3. 
To save your image, go to File ➤ Export to save your image if it is a JPG or TIF. Or click

Summary 
This chapter covers everything to do with the perimeter of your image. We showed you how to 
add a frame or border to your image and how to crop and resize an image. We also showed you 
how to straighten an image and correct perspective distortion. In the next chapter, you will learn 
how to fix problems in images.

Fixing Problems in Images 
In This Chapter 
• 
How to assess problems in images 
• 
How to fix a range of problems in images 
As a beginner, you may want to improve a digital image but are unsure of the best way to do 
this with GIMP. Maybe you have some scanned photos or digital images that need a little 
improvement. This chapter will show you where to find the tools to reduce or eliminate a 
problem in your image. 
To help you assess problems with your images, this chapter has a gallery of photos with 
common problems and their solutions. Some of the images are recent and some of the images are 
over a hundred years old. They include images that are too bright, too dark, are lacking in color, 
have too much color, or are flat and dull. The gallery also has examples of sharpening, removing 
spots, removing red eye, and whitening teeth. 
Assessing Images 
You don’t need to be an expert to assess the faulty areas of a photo. It just takes common sense. 
Open the image you would like to improve in GIMP and take a good look at the image. (See 
Chapter 2 if you need help with opening an image). Ask yourself the following questions:  
• 
Is the image too bright?  
• 
Is the image too dark? 
• 
Is the image dull or lacking in contrast?  
• 
Is the image lacking sharpness; in other words, is it out of focus or unclear? 
Look through the pictures in the gallery below and see if you can spot a similar problem to 
your problem. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
86 
Image Assessment Gallery 
The gallery in Table 5-1 shows images with problems. There is often more than one way to 
improve an image. GIMP is packed full of options. You can take easy steps or steps that are more 
complex. Most of the more complex tools give you a greater degree of control. The easy options 
are listed first. Most of these tasks are fun to do, particularly when you make real improvements 
to favorite images. 
The quality of your result depends on the quality of your original image.

Assessing Brightness and Darkness 
Take a good look at a photo you wish to work on. To help you assess the faults in your images, we 
will explore some terms a little further. 
Too Bright (Overexposed) 
In Figure 5-1, the top photo has blown highlights and pale colors; it lacks contrast. The bottom 
image has been edited in GIMP. It is not a perfect repair. However, the process improves a 30-
year-old image. 
 
Figure 5-1. Notice the blown highlights in the taller boy’s shirt and on the grandfather’s head in the top 
photo; it also lacks contrast. The bottom photo is the result of corrections made in GIMP. 
Too Dark (Underexposed) 
The top image in Figure 5-2 is very dark. This is an example of an underexposed image. The 
bottom image is the same image after editing in GIMP. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
90 
 
Figure 5-2. The top image was taken with a two-year-old digital camera; it was underexposed, resulting in a 
very dark image. The bottom photo is the same image after editing in GIMP. 
Image Too Dull (Lacking Contrast) 
An image that is dull has poor contrast and lacks snap. A dull image usually lacks black. Look at 
the top image in Figure 5-3 below; there are dark tones but not a deep black. Similarly, although 
the photo contains some white in the clouds and in the caps on two of the tourists, that white is 
dull. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
91 
 
Figure 5-3. The top image is flat; it lacks contrast. The bottom image has been edited in GIMP.  
Assessing Your Editing  
After assessing the problems in your image, the next step is to start editing the image in GIMP. 
When working on your images, zoom to 100% (to zoom to 100%, type 1 on your keyboard). 
Chapter 2 has more information on zooming. There are times when you may want to zoom in 
more than 100%, particularly when you are working on fine details. 
Before you save or export your image, you need to decide where the image will go. Is it to be a 
printed image or will the image be shown on a digital frame, a web page, or e-mailed to friends? 
The wrong choice of resolution and image file type might waste a lot of your editing time. Go to 
Chapter 3 if you need help in choosing the best resolution and file type for your image. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
92 
Editing Checklist 
As you start to correct your image, check that you can see details in the highlights, midtones, and 
shadows. If you overcorrect, some parts of the image may look great but this change may 
adversely affect other parts of the image. For example, you may be able to bring a lot of detail 
back into a washed out area but lose definition in darker areas of an image. If this does happen to 
you, do not despair, these problems can sometimes occur when you edit the whole image. In 
Chapter 6, we show you how to adjust part of an image, using selections, while leaving other parts 
untouched. 
Areas of GIMP Used in This Chapter 
Most of the activity in this chapter takes places in the Colors menu. Figure 5-4 shows you where 
the Brightness-Contrast, Levels, and Curves options are located in the Colors menu.  
When we give a direction such as go to Colors ➤ Brightness-Contrast, it means go to the 
Colors menu as seen in Figure 5-4 and click the word “Colors” to open the menu. Scroll down the 
menu list until you come to Brightness-Contrast. Click Brightness-Contrast to open a small 
Brightness Contrast dialog window. 
Undoing an Edit with Undo History 
When editing, you can change your mind using GIMP’s Undo History. See Figure 5-4. Each 
mouse click results in a temporary thumbnail image in Undo History. To move back, click on a 
thumbnail image in your Undo History.  
The Undo History is not saved when you export or save your image. See Chapter 10 to 
increase the number of undo steps. 
The keyboard shortcut to undo one action is Control+Z or Command+Z for Mac.

Correcting with Brightness (Contrast) 
Brightness-Contrast is a convenient tool for beginners. It consists of two easy-to-use sliders. 
(GIMP has two other solutions that are more powerful: Levels and Curves.) 
Keep in mind the aim as you edit is to increase the contrast without losing fine details in the 
photo. 
1. 
Open your image in GIMP. 
2. 
Go to the Colors menu, scroll down and click on Brightness Contrast (see Figure 5-5). 
This screenshot shows the GIMP workspace in single-window mode with three images 
open. To access single-window mode, go to Windows ➤ Single-Window Mode. If you 
have more than one version of an image open, you can click from one image to the 
other to compare your edits.

For an image that is too bright, try moving the Brightness slider to the left. If you have 
an image that is too dark, move the Brightness slider to the right. If your image lacks 
contrast, try moving the Brightness slider to the left and the Contrast slider to the right 
(see Figure 5-7).

Improving Tones in Images with Levels 
In addition to Brightness-Contrast, Levels and Curves are two more options available in GIMP for 
adjusting tones in an image. They are useful for repairing images that are overexposed (too light), 
underexposed (too dark), and lacking in contrast (too dull). This section looks at using Levels to 
improve your image. 
The Levels option is relatively new. There are many ways to use Levels, some techniques are 
quite complex. This section looks at a couple of easy ways of improving photos with Levels. The 
Levels option is located at Colors ➤ Levels (see Figure 5-9). 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
97 
 
Figure 5-9. To get to Levels, click Colors, scroll down, and click on Levels 
Look at the Levels pop-up dialog window in Figure 5-10. The graph you see is called a 
histogram. The histogram gives visual measurements of the tones in your image. At the left end of 
the histogram are the dark-to-black tones and at the right end of the histogram are the lighter-to-
white tones. The height of the graph indicates the amount of a tone in the image. 
 
Figure 5-10. The Levels pop-up window or dialog. This histogram is showing most information at the dark 
end of the spectrum. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
98 
When working with Levels, the focus for beginners is on the Input Levels. A lot is possible 
using the Input Levels area. Output Levels is not intuitive and perhaps not for beginners. 
■ Note Channels: In GIMP, digital color images are made from a mixture of red, green and blue (RGB). 
Color is stored in red, green and blue channels. In some GIMP’s editing options such as Levels and Curves, 
you can edit individual channels for greater control. Value refers to the combined output from the RGB 
channels. The Alpha channel (when present) controls the amount of transparency in an image. 
The Channel Area is set to Value by default, this is a mix of the red, green and blue channels. 
However, once you are confident using Levels, you can experiment by opening the drop-down 
Channel list and try altering the red, blue, or green channels separately. Every image is different 
so this is an area where playing around with individual channels may bring something useful for 
your image. 
Improving a Low Contrast Image with Levels 
1. 
Open your image in GIMP and access Levels in the menu system by going to Colors ➤ 
Levels (see Figure 5-9). This screenshot is also showing the GIMP workspace in single-
window mode.  
2. 
Here is a reminder in case you are not working in single-window mode: to access it, go 
to Windows ➤ Single-Window Mode. 
3. 
The Levels pop-up dialog is shown in Figure 5-10. 
4. 
Make sure the Preview box is ticked in the Levels dialog box so you can see the effects 
as soon as you make adjustments.

6. 
Then click Auto (see Figure 5-11). 
7. 
Now try moving the middle slider, as shown in Figure 5-12. You can judge how far you 
need to move the slider by looking at its effect on the image. Click the Reset button if 
you are unhappy with your choices.

■ Tip Black and White Images in GIMP 
If you are working with black and white images, don’t be put off by the Colors menu. The Colors section 
works just well with black and white images because it works on tones. Tones exist in color and black and 
white images. 
Improving an Old Photo with Levels 
The image in Figure 5-13 was found in an old box of papers. It had darkened over the years and 
seemed beyond repair. After scanning, the image was edited in GIMP. Sometimes an image is not 
aesthetically brilliant but is still of value to family members as a rare glimpse of a past time. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES

Figure 5-13. On the left is a dark, scratched image from 1915; on the right is the same image after Levels 
were adjusted. 
Levels Disadvantage 
Using Levels produces a good tonal range but sometimes there is a noticeable loss of color. Of 
course, this is not a concern if your image is black and white. One of GIMP’s most popular and 
effective color tools is next: Curves. 
■ Tip The Curves Tool is one of GIMP’s most popular tools because it offers a lot of control over tones and 
colors. It’s worth trying. 
Correcting a Dull Image with Curves 
Many people say Curves is their favorite tool in GIMP. It has some simple options for beginners 
and more complex options for the adventurous. The Curves Tool works on every tone in an 
image. It can make changes to the brightest part of the image as well as the dark areas. Like the 
Levels Tool, you can work on the whole image or work on the red, blue, and green color channels 
separately. People generally work on all channels together. 
The S Curve 
To add some contrast to a dull image, follow these steps:  
1. 
In the top menu, go to Colors and click Curves (see Figure 5-14). The Curves dialog or 
window will open. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
102 
 
Figure 5-14. To access Curves, go Colors, scroll down, and click Curves. 
2. 
In the Curves pop-up window, tick the Preview box (see Figure 5-15). This will allow 
you to see changes you make directly on the screen. The peaks in your histogram show 
you where the tones are in your image. A peak in the graph towards the left of your 
screen represents the dark tones; a peak in the middle is the middle or grayish tones. 
Peaks at the extreme right end of the graph shows the amount of highlights in an 
image.  
 
Figure 5-15. Curves has a graph known as a histogram. The left side shows the darkest tones; the 
right side shows the white end of the range. Note that the Preview box is ticked. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
103 
3. 
Use your mouse on the central line in the histogram to make a small S shape, as shown 
in Figure 5-16. 
4. 
Click Preview on and off so you can compare your changes with the original image. 
5. 
How small or big your S curve needs to be depends on the image. Keep checking the 
screen as you work to make sure you are adding the correct amount of brightness and 
darkness. If you start to lose details in the image, you’ve moved the line too far.  
6. 
Click OK when you have improved the contrast and kept details in the highlights and 
shadows.  
7. 
Save or Export your image. See Chapter 3 if you are unsure how to Save. 
 
Figure 5-16. The center line in the Curves histogram is now a gentle S shape.  
See Figure 5-17 for a before and after example using Curves.

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
106 
Improving Color and Tone with Curves 
Extending the Histogram 
There is another easy way to improve the tone and color of a photo using Curves. This method 
involves moving the brightest point and the darkest point towards the middle of the histogram. 
You will be extending the tonal range of the photo by removing tones without information in 
them. Try this exercise; you will see a difference in your image. 
1. 
Go to Colors ➤ Curves. (Go back to Figure 5-14 if you are unsure.) 
2. 
In the Curves pop-up window, click the Preview button so you can see changes you 
make to the graph in your image (see Figure 5-20). 
3. 
In the Curves Histogram, move each end of the diagonal line to the start of the image 
information. For an example look at the lower histogram in Figure 5-20. 
4. 
Check your changes with the original image by clicking on the Preview box. 
5. 
Click OK when the image looks brighter and more natural. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
107 
 
Figure 5-20.  The top shows the image and graph before using curves to improve brightness and tonality; the 
bottom image is the result of applying Curves. 
Color Too Strong (Oversaturated) 
The top image in Figure 5-21 is oversaturated; the red colors don’t look natural. One of the easiest 
ways to correct oversaturation is using GIMP’s Hue-Saturation.  

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
108 
Hue-Saturation 
The Hue-Saturation Tool is useful for reducing the amount of color in an image. The top image in 
Figure 5-21 is oversaturated or has too much color. 
 
Figure 5-21. The lower image has been desaturated using Hue-Saturation 
Removing Strong Colors 
To desaturate or reduce color that is too strong and unnatural in an image, follow these steps: 
1. 
Open your saturated image in GIMP. 
2. 
Go to Colors and click Hue-Saturation (see Figure 5-22). 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
109 
 
Figure 5-22. Hue-Saturation is located under the Colors menu. 
3. 
The Hue-Saturation dialog window will open (see Figure 5-23). 
4. 
Click the Preview button, to see the changes you make directly on the image. 
5. 
Slide the Saturation slider to the left. This takes some of the color from your photo. 
This may be all you need to do. However, you may find that the colors then don’t look 
natural. Try moving the Hue slider to the left and or right to correct the colors (see 
Figure 5-23). 
 
Figure 5-23. The Saturation slider moved to -19. 
6. 
When the colors in your image look natural, click OK. Then Save or Export your image. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
110 
Color Cast and Color Balance 
The top image in Figure 5-24 below has a red color cast. The unnatural color balance can be 
corrected using GIMP’s Hue-Saturation Tool. 
 
Figure 5-24. The top image has a red color cast; the lower image was corrected using Hue-Saturation. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
111 
Noisy Image 
A noisy image is an image that has a large number of unwanted tiny colored dots scattered 
throughout a photo. If there is noise in a photo, it will be most noticeable in the dark areas. In 
Figure 5-25, the top image has noise scattered all over it.  
 
Figure 5-25. The top image is noisy; it has tiny unwanted colored pixels sprinkled over the image. The lower 
image has had the noise reduced using GIMP’s NL Filter 
A noisy image can occur when you are taking photos in low light. Noise can also occur on 
images when you wind the sensitivity or ISO up on your digital camera. The NL Filter is a good 
noise reduction filter. This filter works on the whole image; in comparison, the Filters ➤ Enhance 
➤ Despeckle Filter can work on a selected area of an image. 
Noise Reduction NL Filter 
The NL (Non Linear) Filter is useful for reducing or removing noise in an image.  

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
112 
1. 
Go to Filters ➤ Enhance ➤ NL Filter (see Figure 5-26). 
 
Figure 5-26. The NL Filter helps reduce noise in images. 
2. 
Tick the Preview box so you can see the changes in the pop-up NL Filter box (Figure 5-
27 below). 
3. 
Choose the filter setting “Alpha trimmed mean.” See Figure 5-27.With this setting, the 
filter looks at tiny groups of pixels and removes any pixels not like its neighbors.  
4. 
Choose Alpha slider: .0 
5. 
For Radius, try between .50 and 1.0. Check the effect on the dark areas of your photo in 
the Preview area. Adjust the radius until you see the best reduction of color noise. 
6. 
Click Ok when you see the image has less noise. Then Export or Save your image. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
113 
 
Figure 5-27. Try using the NL Filter to reduce noise in your photos. 
If you can’t see your NF filter once selected, or if it disappears, go to Filters ➤ Reshow Filter. 
This will bring the selected filter action box back to the top layer of your desktop. 
Sharpening an Image 
The aim of digital sharpening tools is to improve the sharpness of images. An image that is badly 
out of focus can’t be repaired but an image that is slightly soft can be improved in GIMP. 
If you aren’t sure what sharpening can do, look at the two images in Figure 5-28. The image 
on the left is slightly soft compared to the image on the right, which looks clearer. The photo on 
the right in Figure 2-28 was sharpened in GIMP.  
So when should you use a sharpening tool? 
• 
After you resize an image, sharpening will improve the clarity of the image. 
• 
If you have a converted RAW file, no sharpening is applied to the image in the camera. 
A sharpening tool will improve the image.  
• 
If your photo is a JPG, it will have had some sharpening in the camera and may not 
need more sharpening. 
• 
If an image is soft, it is worth trying a sharpening tool. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
114 
The important thing to note about sharpening an image is that it should be the last editing 
process carried out on the image. Any editing on the image after sharpening will lessen the effect 
of the sharpening. As a rule, sharpen your image as the last step in your digital editing process. 
 
Figure 5-28. The image on the left is slightly out of focus; the image on the right has been edited with 
Unsharp Mask. 
A very nice sharpening tool in GIMP is the very unhelpfully named Unsharp Mask Tool 
(Figure 5-29). It gives a lot of control and the possibility of a good outcome. Unsharp Mask is a 
confusing term; it is a sharpening method that originated in Germany in the 1930s. Both GIMP 
and Photoshop use a digital version of this process. In contrast, Sharpen, which is also a GIMP 
sharpening tool, provides a limited amount of sharpening control. Use Unsharp Mask for best 
results. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
115 
 
Figure 5-29. GIMP’s best sharpening method, Unsharp Mask, is located in the Filters ➤ Enhance 
menu. 
To Sharpen an Image with Unsharp Mask 
1. 
Zoom in so you are at 100%. Pressing the number 1 on your keyboard will zoom your 
image 100%. 
2. 
Go to Filters ➤ Enhance ➤ Unsharp Mask (Figure 5-29). Don’t choose Sharpen. 
3. 
When the pop-up dialog window opens, tick the Preview box so you can view your 
sharpening efforts in that window (See Figure 5-30 below). 
4. 
Try the default setting of Radius: 5.0, Amount: .50, and Theshold: 0. This may be too 
harsh and overly sharp; if so, try a lower number in the Radius and Amount boxes. You 
can see the settings have a lower number in Figure 5-30; the default settings were too 
harsh for the picture taken at the zoo. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
116

5. 
Check the effect of your sharpening by turning Preview on and off. 
6. 
See Figure 5-31 for an example of an oversharpened image. Every image requires 
slightly different settings, so it is best to experiment with the sliders. Usually the best 
sharpening effects come from the application of a small amount of sharpening. 
7. 
When you are satisfied with the sharpening, click OK. 
 
Figure 5-31. The photo on the left has had a small amount of Unsharp Mask; the photo on the 
right has been oversharpened in Unsharp Mask. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
117 
Removing Red Eye 
Red eye is a photographic effect that accidently gives a person or animal red pupils (see Figure 5-
32). This occurs when a flash is fired directly in front of the subject’s face. GIMP can remove red 
eyes in images. The way to avoid red eye in the future is to not use a flash in front of a face. If 
possible, bounce the flash off a ceiling or nearby wall.  
Selections 
To remove red eye in GIMP, involves selecting each eye and then applying the fix. Knowing how 
to select parts of a photo opens up a world of editing possibilities, which we explore more fully in 
the next chapter. 
 
Figure 5-32. Top photo before Red Eye Removal; bottom photo after Red Eye Removal.  
Red Eye Removal 
Removing red eye from a photo is a two-step process. First, the eyes are selected. Then the Red 
Eye Removal Filter is applied to the selection.  
1. 
Zoom into your image so you are seeing it at 100% or greater. Pressing the number 1 
on your keyboard will zoom your image 100%. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES

2. 
In the Toolbox, select the Ellipse tool (Figure 5-33). The tool selects an area of a 
picture.  
Select Ellipse tool
Drag mouse across each eye
 
Figure 5-33. Zoom in to see the eyes clearly, select the Ellipse Tool, and drag your mouse across 
an eye. 
3. 
With your mouse, drag an ellipse over one eye in your photo, hold the shift button, and 
then select the other eye. In this way you select both eyes and can work on them at the 
same time. If you have trouble selecting the two eyes, select one eye and complete the 
steps in this exercise. Then select the other eye and repeat the steps. The selection/s 
will allow you to apply the Red Eye Removal filter the eyes rather than to the whole 
image. Applying the filter without selecting the eyes would result in unusual color 
changes for the rest of the image. 
4. 
To access Red Eye Removal, go to the menu Filters ➤ Enhance ➤ Red Eye Removal 
(Figure 5-34). 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
119 
 
Figure 5-34. The Red Eye Removal filter is located at Filters ➤ Enhance ➤ Red Eye Removal. 
5. 
In the pop-up Red Eye Removal window, tick the Preview box (Figure 5-35). This will 
allow you to see the changes as you move the Threshold slider. The default setting (the 
Threshold at 50) may work for you. If you can still see redness in the eye, increase the 
Threshold amount.

Using Brushes to Repair Images 
The rest of this chapter looks at repairing images with GIMP’s brushes. GIMP has a range of 
brushes that are very useful for touching up photos. The advantage of a brush is that you are only 
affecting the part of the image your brush is moving over. You can choose the shape and 
thickness of the brush. You can choose how much of a brush stroke is visible and what 
percentage of the stroke is transparent. You can decide to make the brush dynamic so that the 
pressure and speed of your strokes behaves like a real brush. For beginners, we show you how to 
start using the default settings for each brush. Only change the brush options if you are not happy 
with the result or if you feel like experimenting.  
Whitening Teeth 
This is a simple way to whiten teeth using the Dodge Brush. The Dodge Brush just affects the area 
stroked by the Brush; it doesn’t change the whole image (Figure 5-36). 
 
Figure 5-36. The top photo before teeth whitening; the bottom photo after teeth whitening using the Dodge 
Brush 
To Whiten Teeth 
To whiten teeth: 
1. 
Open the image in GIMP. 
2. 
Zoom in so that the teeth are very large. Try the number 4 on your keyboard to zoom in 
400%. When you wish to compare at 100%, type the number 1 on your keyboard. 
3. 
Click on the Dodge Brush in the Toolbox (Figure 5-37). 
4. 
Located below the Toolbox are the Dodge Brush options. (When you click a tool in the 
Toolbox, the options below change according to the tool selected.) 
5. 
In the Tool Options, choose Round Fuzzy Brush, Size 7.0, Dodge, Midtones, and 50% 
exposure. 
6. 
In Figure 5-37, you can see the outline of the Dodge Brush over a tooth. To make your 
Dodge Brush smaller, choose a smaller number in the Size box in the Tool Options 
area (see Figure 5-37). 
7. 
Brush once over the teeth to whiten them. If you make a mistake, use your Undo 
History to go back a step or two. You can also go back a step by clicking Control+Z. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES

Brightening Part of a Photo (Dodging) 
The Dodge Brush allows you to lighten a small part of a photo without affecting the rest of the 
photo. The Dodge Brush is located in the Toolbox. It may be used to brighten part of a photo, 
such as the football in Figure 5-38, however the brush can’t add in details not there in the first 
place.

Darkening or Burning part of an Image 
To burn an image is to darken part of an image. You might want to darken something in the 
photo so that it doesn’t distract the viewer from the main subject. In Figure 5-40 below, the white 
car was darkened with the Burn Brush.  
Note that using the Burn Brush only affects the pixels the brush touches. It leaves the rest of 
the image unchanged. However, if you darken a washed out area too much, it will look unnatural 
and will not provide missing details. 
1. 
Open your image in GIMP. 
2. 
Click on the Dodge/Burn Brush in the Toolbox (Figure 5-39). 
Select
Dodge/Burn

3. 
In the Dodge/Burn Options box located below the Toolbox, choose Burn to darken 
part of your image.  
4. 
Adjust the size of your brush using the up or down arrow in the Size area in the Tool 
Options. Alternatively make the brush larger by clicking ] on your keyboard a few 
times; to make the brush smaller, click [. 
5. 
In the Range area, choose whether you wish to work on shadows, midtones, or 
highlights. 
6. 
Choose the Round Fuzzy Brush, and try the Exposure at 50%. Increasing the Exposure 
will increase the effect. 
7. 
Zoom into your image by typing the number 2 or 3 on your keyboard. 
8. 
Brush over the area you wish to darken. 
9. 
Click on Undo History on the left of your screen if you need to undo the effect. Or type 
Control+Z.

Unwanted Spots or Blotches 
You can remove an unwanted spot in GIMP using the Smudge Brush, the Healing Brush, or the 
Clone Tool. 
Removing Spots with the Smudge Brush 
The Smudge Brush is quite easy to use but is not effective in all situations (see Figure 5-41). 
 
Figure 5-41. Top image has a distracting white mark high on the wall; the mark was removed in the bottom 
image with GIMP’s Smudge Brush. 
1. 
Open your image in GIMP 
2. 
Select the Smudge Brush from the Toolbox (Figure 5-42). 
3. 
Make you brush size larger than the area you wish to smudge. In Toolbox Options 
located below the Toolbox, change the number in the Size area to make your brush 
bigger.

Figure 5-43. The top image has unwanted spots and stains on the dress and throughout the 120-year-old 
scanned image. The image on the bottom shows the results after using the Healing Brush. The contrast was 
improved using Curves. 
The scanned photo in Figure 5-43 is 120 years old. It has mildew and some unwanted spots 
on the dress and wall in the background. Using the Healing Brush on the image helps to repair 
the damage of time. You could also use this technique for a color photo. The Healing Brush is 
useful for removing skin blemishes, spots off curtains and walls, etc. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ FIXING PROBLEMS IN IMAGES 
128 
Spot Removing with the Healing Brush 
To remove spots from your image using the Healing Brush: 
1. 
Open your spotty image. 
2. 
Zoom into your image 150% or more. One way of zooming is to use the drop down 
selector shown in Figure 5-44. 
3. 
Select the Healing Brush from the Toolbox (Figure 5-44).

Figure 5-44. Zoom in to 100 - 150% so you can clearly see the problem area, Control+click on an 
area with similar texture and color to the area you want to repair. 
4. 
The Healing Brush will not work until you activate it. Find an area of your image with 
the same texture, color, and tone as your damaged area. Control+click with your 
mouse to select that area as the healing source. Figure 5-44 shows the healing source 
for the lace blouse. A separate part of the blouse was selected to remove the spot from 
the pleated area of the blouse.

When you are happy with your efforts, Save or Export your image. 
Making Brushes Dynamic 
If you want to get slightly more adventurous, you can make your brushes sensitive to pressure 
and speed. This option works for all brushes. In the Tool Options for your brush, click on the icon 
next to Dynamics and choose Basic Dynamics (Figure 5-45).

Summary 
Fixing problems in images can be rewarding and fun. The image gallery is there to help you 
identify common problems with images. The rest of the chapter showed you how to improve your 
images. The techniques in the first part of the chapter changed the whole image while the digital 
brushes shown later in the chapter only affect the areas touched by the brush. If you enjoyed 
working with brushes, making them dynamic gives you a lot of control.

The next chapter takes a leap into the world of digital creativity. It shows you more ways to 
select part of an image to perform a task. You can also be creative by adding photos together in 
layers.

• 
Adding multiple images using layers  
• 
Working on part of an image 
• 
Cloning or copying parts of an image 
• 
Applying GIMP’s filters to change the look of your images 
The exercises in this chapter will greatly increase your digital editing skills and expand your 
creative options.You can create images that in the past needed expensive professional 
equipment. You will learn to use layers to combine two or more images together. You will 
discover how to select and work on a part of an image using selections. You will see how to copy 
or clone parts of an image. Finally, we introduce you to GIMP’s filters. Filters can radically change 
the way your image looks. 
How Difficult Is This Chapter? 
If you have completed some of the earlier exercises in this book, you should have no problems 
learning about selections and layers. Selections use tools from the Toolbox and Layers makes use 
of some menu items and GIMP’s right hand panel. 
The filters at the end of the chapter are easy to use. You open an image, select a filter from 
the Filter menu, and click OK. Some filters contain additional options that you can try out. The 
main danger with filters for beginners is the tendency to use them all the time. 
Before and After Gallery 
The gallery in this chapter has before and after photos to demonstrate the changes you can make 
to your images using the methods in this chapter. Look through the gallery and choose a few 
techniques to try on your digital projects. One of the most enjoyable parts of digital image editing 
is that you can try out ideas without destroying the original.

If you want the text to curve and change shape, see the paths examples in Chapter 9. 
Text on a Transparent Background  
Text on a transparent background can be useful for web site design or for placing text over any 
image.  
• 
The text on a transparent background will show the background color of the website 
or image. The text will blend into the look of the web site. 
• 
The transparent text can be a small PNG or GIF file; this will help the page load faster. 
To make text on a transparent background: 
1. 
Go to File ➤ New (see Figure 6-3). 
 
Figure 6-3. Create a new image by going to File ➤ New. 
2. 
In the pop-up Create New Image window, click Advanced Options (see Figure 6-4).

Layers 
You can add two or more images together in GIMP using layers. Using layers opens a world of 
creativity for the artistically minded. 
Layers are separate images stacked on top of each other to make one picture. Usually there is 
a background image with one or more images placed on separate layers on top of this 
background layer. Placing images on different layers allows you to work on each layer separately. 
Adding Two or More Images Together 
In the pre-digital imaging days, it was possible to add images together by cutting and pasting. 
When you wanted to make up an image from parts of other images, you cut out the images and 
then pasted the images on a sheet of paper. Using this cut-and-paste method, you could control 
where each part was placed, but you couldn’t change the size of any part or its transparency. If 
you made a mistake, you had to find more copies of the images and reassemble them. 
The Layers area in GIMP allows you to 
• 
Add two or more images together using layers. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
139 
• 
Change the transparency of any layer. 
• 
Edit each layer separately using GIMP’s tools or filters. 
• 
Join layers together and edit them together. 
• 
Change the order of the layers. 
• 
Change which layers are visible. 
• 
Save your layers in a XCF file to work on later. 
• 
Export the finished image as a TIF, PSD, JPG, etc. 
What Sorts of Images Can Layers Produce? 
The following are some examples of images made with GIMP’s layers.  
In Figure 6-9, there are three separate photo layers: the text (Mungo National Park), a photo 
of a rock carving, and a photo of sand and rock formations. 
 
Figure 6-9. Three separate images: the text, the carved rock, and the landscape can be put on separate layers. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
140 
These three picture elements were put on separate layers in GIMP. In Figure 6-10, the 
composite image shows the modern Aboriginal rock carving with an overview of the Lake Mungo 
dry lake system and the text naming the area. 
 
Figure 6-10. In this example of a layered image, the landscape is the background image, the rock image was 
placed above the background layer, and the text layer was added as the top layer. 
The second example in Figure 6-11 shows two BMX riders. 
 
Figure 6-11. Two photos are on separate layers in this image. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS

Creating a New Blank Layer 
To add a blank layer to your open image, follow these steps: 
1. 
In the Layer menu, click on New Layer (see Figure 6-13). By default, a layer is created 
the same size as your open image; it also creates the layer as a transparency. 
 
Figure 6-13. The Layer menu 
2. 
The pop-up Create a New Layer dialog window gives the choice of changing the size of 
the layer and of choosing a foreground color, background color, white, or transparency 
(see Figure 6-14). (Beginners can leave the default settings and click OK). 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS

Here is the important part. When the new layer is created, the layer is added to the 
Layers dialog located on the right of your screen, see Figure 6-15. If you can’t see the 
Layers dialog, click on the Layers icon shown in Figure 6-15. This figure also shows two 
layers, the original layer and above that the new transparent layer.

Adding a Layer with Images Open in GIMP 
This example shows how to add a layer from images already open in GIMP.  
1. 
Open two images in GIMP’s single-window mode. The images appear as thumbnails 
photos near the top of the window, as you can see in Figure 6-16. (See Chapter 2 for 
further information about single-window mode.)  
2. 
Drag the thumbnail of an image across to the second image and then keep dragging 
the image down on the opened image (see Figure 6-16).  
Drag the thumbnail of the
image across the other
thumbnail image. Then drag
it down to the open image.
 
Figure 6-16. Add a layer by dragging the thumbnail of an open image onto another opened image. 
3. 
This second photo is added as a layer to the first image. Look at the Layers dialog panel 
on the right of the screen to see both images displayed as layers (see Figure 6-17). 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS

Figure 6-17. New layers always appear at the top of the Layers dialog.  
At this point, there are two layers both with an image of a bike rider. You can use the eye icon 
to turn each layer on and off (see Figure 6-17). However, with both layers turned on you can only 
see the top layer. This is because the top layer has no transparent areas. Unless we make a 
transparent area on the top layer we will not be able to see the layer below. 
In Figure 6-18, the eraser was used to remove part of the top layer. We can see part of the 
bike rider on the layer below. 
The eraser was
used to remove
part of layer one
to show layer
two below.
Layer one is selected.
Part of layer two is
now showing under
layer one.
 
Figure 6-18. Two layers open with part of the top layer erased 
When you click the eye icon on a layer, it turns the layer on or off (see Figure 6-19).

Layer one is selected. The erased
area can be seen.
Layer two is turned off.
 
Figure 6-19. Click the eye icon to turn a layer on or off. Layer one shows its newly erased area. Layer two is 
turned off. 
Opening a Layer - alternate 
Another way to add a layer is go to the File menu, scroll down, and use the Open Image as Layers 
option.  
Duplicating a Layer 
In the top menu, click Layer, scroll down, and click Duplicate Layer. Look at the Layer dialog on 
the right side of your screen in single-window mode and you will see two identical layers. 
Viewing or Hiding a Layer 
The Layers panel is located on the right of your screen. Click the eye icon to turn a layer on. You 
can press Shift + Click on the eye icon to show the visibility of just that layer. 
Click the eye icon to turn a layer off. Turning off a layer means it is not visible on the 
workspace. It hasn’t been erased—it’s just not visible. 
Working on a Layer 
You can only work on one layer at a time. This means the changes you make to a layer only affect 
that layer and not any other layers you may have.  
To work on a layer, in the Layers panel on the right, click the layer you wish to work on. The 
highlighted layer is the active layer and is the only layer available to work on. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
146 
Linking or Grouping Layers Together 
It can be useful to link related layers together to group, tone, rotate, move, or scale them. To link 
layers together, go to the Layers panel, select a layer, and click the blank area next to the eye  icon 
(see Figure 6-20). A chain icon appears. Select another layer and click the area next to the eye icon 
to activate the link to the first selected layer. More layers can be linked by repeating this process.  
Rearranging the Order of Your Layers 
In the Layers dialog, drag the layer up or down to put the layers in a different order.  
(See Figure 6-20.) 
Deleting a Layer 
In the Layers dialog, select the layer you wish to delete and click the trash can button located at 
the bottom of the layer (see Figure 6-20).  
Changing the Transparency of a Layer 
In the Layers dialog, select the layer you wish to change and then change the amount of 
transparency using the arrows in the Opacity area (see Figure 6-20). If you need to position two 
layers exactly, try reducing the transparency of the top layer to see through to the layer below. 
Turn on Layer dialog
Change Opacity.
Click here to link layers

Figure 6-20. The Layers dialog 
Erasing Part of a Layer 
To erase part of a layer, in the Layer dialog, select the layer in question. Then, in the top Layer 
menu scroll down to Transparency ➤ Add Alpha Channel. You can now erase parts of the selected 
layer. The areas of the layer you erase will reveal the layer below. The checkered area shows the 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
147 
erased parts of the layer. A non-destructive way to erase part of a layer is by using a Layer Mask, 
we discuss this later in the chapter. 
Merging Layers 
You can merge all your layers together and remove any alpha channel by going to the Layer menu 
and choosing Flatten Image. Just remember this action is permanent. It is useful to do this if you 
are saving the image as a JPG. 
Saving Layers 
To save an image with its layers intact in GIMP, you can save using GIMP’s XCF file format or use 
the Export menu to export the image as a PSD file. The PSD file will open in Photoshop or GIMP.  
■ Note If GIMP is running slowly, it is possible to allocate more RAM for your work. Go to Edit ➤ 
Preferences ➤ Environment and increase the size of the file cache and the size of the Undo Memory. How 
much you increase the RAM depends on the RAM in your computer. If you have 2GB or more of RAM on 
your machine, definitely increase the RAM allocation in the Environment area to improve GIMP’s 
performance. 
Layer Masks (Non-Destructive Editing) 
The Layer Mask is an advanced feature that is used to create complex layer compositions without 
any destructive editing. A Layer Mask offers the following benefits: 
• 
Lets you hide or show parts of that layer.  
• 
You control how much of a layer shows through and how much of a layer is hidden by 
painting on the mask. 
• 
Painting with black on the mask makes those parts of the layer transparent. Painting 
with shades of gray over parts of a layer makes those parts semi-transparent. The 
darker the gray, the more transparent the layer; the lighter the gray, the less 
transparent the layer. 
• 
Black equals full transparency; white removes any masking strokes. 
• 
There are 256 gradations in the mask from black to white, giving a lot of control over 
the amount of transparency.  
To add a layer mask to a layer, go to Layer ➤ Mask ➤ Add Layer Mask (see Figure 6-21).  

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
148 
 
Figure 6-21. Add a Layer Mask to hide or show part of a layer. 
When the layer mask is added to a layer, a thumbnail of the mask appears in the Layers 
dialog. The image in Figure 6-22 has a Layer Mask on layer one. A mask was painted on part  
of layer one to make it transparent. Parts of layer two below are revealed. The Layer dialog  
area shows the thumbnails of the layers: layer one is an image of countryside, layer two is  
shades of blue. 
Layer Mask on sky area
 
Figure 6-22. A Layer Mask on the top layer reveals false sky on the layer below. 
In Figure 6-23 the Layer Mask has been turned off. In the Layers dialog, the Layer Mask has a 
red border to show it has been disabled.

Working on Part of an Image (Selections) 
This is a very useful section for beginners. 
There are times when it is necessary to work on part of an image. The ability to work on part 
of an image without making changes to the whole image opens a range of editing possibilities. 
GIMP has a number of tools available to select parts of an image. Selections are useful for the 
following tasks: 
• 
Adding contrast or brightness to a part of an image. 
• 
Adding sharpening to a part of an image. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
150 
• 
Replacing colors or textures in part of an image. 
• 
Selecting and cutting out part of an image and adding it to another image. 
• 
Selecting an area and changing its shape 
Choosing a Selection 
Sometimes parts of an image will be easy to select, like a white ball on a black background. 
However, if the area you want to select is very close in color and tone to the surrounding areas, 
the selection will take more time to complete. In cases where the colors and tones are similar, 
work on the contrast of the image before making the selection. (You could work on the contrast 
using Colors ➤ Curves .) 
Figure 6-25 is an example of an easy one-click selection. One click of the Fuzzy Select Tool in 
the blank window space and the area was selected. The cream color was selected easily because it 
is in strong contrast to the dark brown window surround. 
 
Figure 6-25. The Fuzzy Select Tool is good for selecting areas contrasting to its surrounding areas. 
Once the window area is selected, it is possible to perform any editing task using GIMP’s 
tools and menus. These edits will only affect the contents inside the selection. 
For example, we can change the selection’s color with the paintbrush from the toolbox (see 
Figure 6-26). The only part of the image that is active is inside the selected area. You can run a 
paintbrush over the entire canvas but it will only paint inside the selected area.  

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
151 
 
Figure 6-26. The paintbrush is selected and can only paint within the selected area. 
Tools to Select Part of an Image 
GIMP has the following selection tools in the Toolbox:  
• 
RRectangle Select is useful for selecting squares or rectangles. Options to this selection 
include feather edges, rounded corners, expand from center, selection by aspect ratio, 
width, height, or size. (see Figure 6-27). 
• 
Ellipse Select can select circular shapes within an image. Options are the same as 
Rectangle Select (feather edges, rounded corners, expand from center, selection by 
aspect ratio, width, height, or size). 
• 
Lasso or Free Select selects areas by allowing clicking around the edge of the 
required selection, no matter what the shape. If you make a mistake selecting, 
unselect by clicking on another tool in the Toolbox and then select the Tool again. 
Options are antialiasing and feather edges. 
• 
Color Select is useful if you have a plain background made up of one color. 
Sometimes it’s easier to select a background rather than the object you want to select, 
which may have a range of tones and colors. Options include feather edges, select 
transparent areas, and threshold (which controls amount of tonal range of the color 
selected).  

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
152 
• 
Fuzzy Select or Magic Wand only selects the area the Magic Wand touches. If you 
click an adjoining area, the wand will select this instead. Shift click will add an area 
you touch. Options include feather edges, select transparent areas, and threshold 
(which controls the range of tones the selection). 
• 
Scissors Select (Intelligent Scissors) is a great tool. Click around the edges of an 
object and the scissors will seek the edges. The selection must be completed by 
clicking on your selection starting point. If you make a mistake selecting, unselect by 
clicking on another tool in the Toolbox and then select the Scissors Tool again. 
Options include feather edges and interactive boundary. With interactive boundary 
selected, adjust the selected areas with your mouse. This means you can freely move 
the selection around. 
• 
Foreground Select is used to select foreground objects. The tool has two actions; 
after selecting the tool, click roughly around the item you wish to select. A blue mask 
will appear, masking out all things excluded from the selection. Next, use your mouse 
to stroke across the parts of the selected area you wish to keep; each stroke helps to 
refine the selection. A lot of people find this tool useful.

Tips for Controlling Selections  
Many beginners miss these very useful selection options. The Selection menu located in the top 
menu area is there to help you control your selections (see Figure 6-28). The Section menu 
contains the following options: 
• 
All: You can select the whole image. 
• 
None: The selection is cancelled. 
• 
Invert: Rather than the inside of the selection being active, Invert makes the outside 
of the selection active and the inside of the selection inactive. Pressing Invert again 
makes the inside of the selection active again. 
• 
Feather: Using Feather can make a selection look more realistic by softening the 
edges. Feather gives the option of feathering the edges. You control feathering by 
choosing the number of pixels for feathering the selection. Zoom to 100% and test 
with 5, 10, or 20 pixels to see what looks the most realistic.  
• 
Shrink: Reduces the size of the selection. 
• 
Grow: Increases the size of the selection. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS

Figure 6-28. The Select menu contains useful options to manipulate your selections. 
Selecting Tricky Areas Using Quick Mask 
Selecting tricky areas usually involves selecting a part of an image that is similar in tone to its 
surrounding pixels. Before making any attempt at selecting, work on the contrast of the image 
first. You could try using ColorsCurves. 
One of the advantages of using Quick Mask is that you can see the selected areas clearly. This 
exercise uses the Scissors Select Tool and the Quick Mask. 
1. 
Open your image in GIMP. 
2. 
Zoom into the subject to be selected. Try zooming 100% by typing 1 on the keyboard or 
2 for 200%. This will help you see more accurately where your selection should be. 
3. 
Click around the subject with the Scissors Select Tool (see Figure 6-29). Close the loop 
by clicking at your starting point.

To remove the Quick Mask, click back on the Quick Mask button in the lower left of the 
workspace. 
8. 
To make the selection more natural, feather your selection; try 5 pixels. 
9. 
When the selection is complete, click on Select ➤ Invert to invert the selection. This 
means that any action you take affects the area outside the selection. 
10. In Figure 6-32, the background was changed to black-and-white by going to Colors ➤ 
Desaturate and choosing Luminosity. (Alternatively, the background could be blurred 
by going to Filters ➤ Blur ➤ Gaussian Blur.)

Cage Transform Tool 
The Cage Transform Tool is a new feature in GIMP 2.8. This tool allows selected objects to be 
stretched or squashed in a natural looking way. The changes are made directly on the canvas.  
To transform an image: 
1. 
Click on the Cage Transform Tool in the Toolbox, see Figure 6-33 
2. 
Select the checkbox under the Toolbox labeled “Create or adjust the cage”. See Figure 
6-33. Place your selection around the object you want to stretch or squash. The more 
accurate your selection, the more natural looking the transformation should be.

Cloning or Copying Parts of an Image 
If you need to copy or clone part of an image, the Clone Tool located in the Toolbox is the best 
tool for the job. You may need to clone part of an image to repair some damage or to cover 
something that is distracting in a photo. You can see an example of cloning in Figure 6-36. The 
middle figure in the white shirt on the left image is not wearing a scarf; however, in the image on 
the right, he is wearing a scarf. The scarf was cloned or copied from the person next to him. 
 
Figure 6-36. A blue and white scarf was added to the person in the middle of the picture on the right using the 
Clone Tool. 
Cloning an Item in an Image 
In Figure 6-36 a scarf is added to the person wearing a white shirt. To use the Clone Tool, follow 
these steps: 
1. 
Open your image in GIMP. 
2. 
Zoom into your image, try clicking 2 or 3 on your keyboard. 
3. 
Choose the Clone Tool from your Toolbox. See Figure 6-37. 
4. 
This is the most important step: the Clone Tool will not work until you activate it. Find 
the area of your image you wish to copy or clone. Control+Click on that spot with your 
mouse to select that area as the cloning source. The Clone tool will copy details from 
that area. 
5. 
Now move the cloning brush to the area where you wish to add the clone information 
and start making some strokes. You can click Control+Z if you need to undo a step.

Color to Black-and-White 
There are a number of ways to change a color photo to a black-and-white photo in GIMP (see 
Figure 6-39). 
 
Figure 6-39. The top image is the original color image; the bottom image has been changed to black-and-
white in GIMP. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
162 
You can change a color image to black-and-white using one of the following methods: 
• 
Go to Image ➤ Mode ➤ Grayscale. The image is changed instantly. 
• 
Go to Colors ➤ Hue Saturation. In the pop-up window, slide the Saturation slider all 
the way to the left. You can adjust the Lightness slider to your taste as well. 
• 
Go to Colors ➤ Desaturate. In the pop-up dialog window, you have a choice of 
choosing Lightness, Luminosity, or Average. 
• 
Experiment to see which black-and-white effect you prefer. 
Changing the Look of Your Images with Filters 
Filters change the look of your images. If you’re a beginner, you may be pleased to hear that filters 
are easy to use. To use most filters, you simply open an image and click on a filter from the Filter 
menu to apply the effect. 
GIMP has over 100 filters. It is not possible in the space available here to go through every 
filter and variation of a filter available in GIMP. Figure 6-40 shows an overview the filters types in 
GIMP’s filter menu. Under each heading is a further list of filters for that category. 
 
Figure 6-40. GIMP’s filters are located in the Filters menu and each listing has a submenu. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS

■ Note Filters are very easy to use. In most cases, you simply open an image and click on a filter to apply 
its effects. Have fun using filters but beware! It’s very easy to start using filters on nearly everything. 
Old Fashioned Sepia Toning 
It is easy to change a color image and give it an old fashioned look in GIMP, like the bottom image 
in Figure 6-41. 
 
Figure 6-41. The top image is the original; the bottom image has had the Old Photo filter applied to it. 
To change a color or black-and-white photo to old fashioned brown/sepia toning, open your 
image. In the top menu go to Filters ➤ Décor ➤ Old Photo (see Figure 6-42). 

CHAPTER 6 ■ DIGITAL IMAGING PROJECTS 
164 
 
Figure 6-42. The Old Photo Filter is located at Filters ➤ Décor ➤ Old Photo. 
The pop-up screen gives a number of options. Here’s a suggestion to get you started: leave 
Defocus unselected, try Border 0 (unless you want a border), select Sepia, and select Work on 
Copy. Click OK. GIMP will make a new copy of your image and make it look old fashioned. 
Warping an Image 
Figure 6-43 shows an image before the IWarp filter was applied and Figure 6-44 shows the image

Summary 
There are countless ways to use GIMP. The gallery at the start of this chapter gives before and 
after views of the exercises in this chapter. Two new important steps for beginners are in this 
chapter, they are layers and selections. We showed you how to add images together using layers 
and how to select and work on part of an image using selections. We show you how to clone or 
copy part of an image and we gave you a taste of GIMP’s many filters. Thanks to a small number 
of voluntary computer scientists dotted around the world, GIMP has evolved into a serious digital 
image-editing platform. 
The next chapters look at the GIMP tools for drawing and painting.

The Benefits of Using a Graphics Tablet 
A graphics or digital tablet is a digital drawing tool for sketching or drawing with the aid of a 
computer. The tablet plugs into the computer and comes with a pen-like stylus that allows more 
artistic control than doing the same actions with a mouse. The stylus feels natural — not just 
while sketching but also while doing photo touch-ups. 
When you draw on the tablet with your stylus, the drawing shows on your computer screen. 
The stylus is sensitive to pressure. A light stylus stroke shows on the screen as a light line and a 
stroke with heavier pressure shows as a darker and thicker line.  
■ Note GIMP supports all Wacom brand tablets  
How to Add a Graphics Tablet 
There are three parts to setting up a graphics tablet in GIMP.  
1. 
Check you have the correct drivers for your tablet installed on your computer. 
2. 
Adjust access settings in the Input Device area of GIMP. 
3. 
To get pressure sensitivity working, check that Basic Dynamics in GIMP is selected. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SETTING UP A GRAPHICS TABLET 
168 
Installing Graphic Drivers on Your Computer 
If you have been using a graphics tablet on your computer for other programs, GIMP will 
probably automatically detect your tablet when it opens for the first time. 
If you are using your tablet for the first time on your computer, here are some general tips to 
get your tablet operating in GIMP. Read the section that refers to your operating system. 
Windows 
If you have the device drivers for your graphic tablet installed, GIMP 2.8 (and later versions) 
automatically detects the tablet. Because every manufacturer designs and bundles driver 
packages for its software differently, we do not cover how to install a driver for your tablet under 
Windows. If you are not sure how to install your tablet driver, look online and follow the maker’s 
instructions. 
If your tablet does not work automatically, plug in your tablet before opening GIMP. Open 
GIMP and then follow the instructions in the ‘Setting Up Your Graphics Tablet’ section below. 
Mac OS X 
Install your tablet’s drivers in the usual way. Plug in the tablet to your USB slot. Turn your 
computer on. Open GIMP and follow the instructions in the ‘Setting Up Your Graphics Tablet’ 
section. 
Linux  
The setup is automatic for most modern Linux distributions. For example, for Ubuntu, you plug 
the tablet into your computer’s USB slot and then turn your computer on. Open GIMP and follow 
the instructions in the ‘Setting Up Your Graphics Tablet’ section. 
For other Linux distributions, it should work automatically. If GIMP is not seeing your tablet, 
you may need to update the drivers.  
With the drivers for your tablet installed, the next step is to add the tablet to GIMP’s Input 
Device area. 
Setting Up Your Graphics Tablet 
If you have your tablet drivers installed, for most people the tablet will work automatically in 
GIMP. 
If your tablet drivers are installed and the tablet does not work automatically: 
1. 
Plug your graphics tablet into your computer’s USB slot. 
2. 
Open GIMP. 
3. 
Go to Edit ➤ Input Devices. See Figure 7-1. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SETTING UP A GRAPHICS TABLET

4. 
In the Input Devices screen, your graphics tablet will appear on the left hand side of 
the screen. Figure 7-2 has a Wacom tablet showing as an ’Input Device’ in GIMP. 
 
Figure 7-2. The ‘Configure Input Devices’ area shows a Wacom tablet and a mouse (Core 
Pointer). 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SETTING UP A GRAPHICS TABLET 
170 
5. 
In the Configure Input Devices area, select your graphics tablet.  
6. 
Under the ‘Mode’ drop-down list for the Pressure Curve, set the device to Screen (see 
Figure 7-2). 
7. 
Click Save and Close. (In the Input Devices area, you can safely ignore the Keys 
section. This is for mapping MIDI devices to the keyboard.) 
■ Note Other devices also work with GIMP. MIDI keyboards and shaped triggers can map to individual 
keys in GIMP. For example, you could change the opacity amount by pressing a key on the MIDI keyboard.  
Troubleshooting Tips 
If your graphics tablet doesn’t show up in the ’Configure Input Devices’ screen, try these tips:  
• 
Check that you have GIMP 2.8 or later installed. 
• 
Plug your tablet into the USB slot and then turn your computer on.  
• 
Open GIMP. 
Adding Pressure Sensitivity to Your Tablet  
Adding pressure sensitivity to your graphical pen in GIMP helps you create natural looking 
strokes in paintings and drawings. In Figure 7-3, you can see a brushstroke without dynamics 
enabled and a stroke with dynamics enabled. 
To add pressure sensitivity to your tablet’s pen:  
1. 
Open a new canvas by going to File ➤ New and click OK.(See Chapter 2 for more 
information about opening files.) 
2. 
Go to the Toolbox and click on the Paintbrush. Try a Paintbrush stroke on your canvas 
(see Figure 7-3). 
3. 
Check your Paintbrush stroke against Figure 7-3. The top black brush stroke does not 
have pressure sensitivity enabled; the lower black brush stroke has pressure sensitivity 
enabled. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SETTING UP A GRAPHICS TABLET

Figure 7-3. To enable Brush Dynamics, click on the Dynamics Menu and select Basic Dynamics. 
4. 
To add Dynamics, in the Tool Options for the Brush, click on the icon next to 
Dynamics Off. In the list of choices, select Basic Dynamics. Choosing Basic Dynamics 
will activate pressure sensitivity for your tablet’s pen.  
Basic Dynamics works on the Paintbrush, Pen and the Airbrush Tools located in the Toolbox. 
Activating Basic Dynamics in the P:aintbrush Tool Options also sets the dynamics for the Pen and 
Airbrush. 
If this is the first time you have used your tablet, be patient. Looking at your monitor while 
drawing onto the tablet feels a little strange at first. Your lines might lean at one end. With 
practice, this will improve. The larger the tablet space, the easier drawing will be. However, larger 
tablets cost more. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SETTING UP A GRAPHICS TABLET 
172 
CANVAS RESOLUTION 
If you’re new to digital painting and editing digital images, you may not know about the importance 
of image resolution. 
Before you start to draw, you need to decide on the resolution of the canvas (or new image) you 
are about to create. The quick and simple answer is if your artwork is for the computer and 
Internet only, choose a resolution of 72 dpi and export (save) the file as a JPG. If you intend to print 
your artwork at a printing shop, choose a resolution of 300 dpi and export your file as a TIF. 
However, if you intend to work on a project over a couple of sessions, choose 300 dpi and save 
your file as an XCF file. XCF files are native to GIMP and store information such as layers and 
guides. XCF files also maintain the best quality for your work. Once your creation is completed, you 
can save your XCF file as a JPG or TIF. 
For further information about resolution and exporting/saving, see Chapter 3. 
Setting Up Your Tablet’s Eraser 
When the Eraser option is set up, you can turn the pen or stylus upside down and rub it on the 
tablet to erase unwanted parts of your work. This makes digital drawing very like using a pencil 
with an eraser attached to the top. 
Follow these steps to set up the eraser: 
1. 
Turn your tablet’s stylus upside down so the thicker end hovers over the tablet. You 
should see it hover on your screen. 
2. 
With your stylus upside down, select the Eraser Tool in the Toolbox. The Eraser Tool is 
near the Brush Tool and looks like an eraser (see Figure 7-4). 
 
Figure 7-4. The Eraser Tool is selected. 
You should now have the GIMP eraser working at the thick end of your stylus. The pointy end 
of the stylus is available for the brush or other tools from the Toolbox. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SETTING UP A GRAPHICS TABLET 
173 
Summary 
This chapter showed how to set up a modern graphics tablet, how to enable the pressure 
sensitivity option for brush strokes, and how to assign GIMP’s eraser function to the top of your 
stylus. The next chapter covers digital drawing. However, if negotiating around GIMP is new to 
you, it might be a good idea to look at Chapter 2, which is all about getting to know the GIMP 
workspace.

Digital Art: Painting in GIMP 
GIMP is not only for editing digital photographs, the tools used for photo editing are also effective 
for digital painting and drawing. Digital art has many facets and different styles. While you are 
bound by the restrictions of your camera and environment, a white canvas enforces no rules—
which leaves you to paint anything that comes to your mind. As with any other creative art form, 
painting is a way of expressing yourself; therefore, this chapter can only tell you techniques and 
ways to use GIMP. 
This chapter will teach you about the tools you need. If you have set up a digital tablet as 
described in Chapter 7, now is the time to use it. 
In This Chapter

Paint Tools in GIMP 
GIMP provides a variety of paint tools. You may have already used some of them for sketching, on 
photos, or for manipulating. Here we show you the purpose of the paint tools for digital painting. 
Most of the paint tools simulate their real-life counterparts. The pencil, for example, paints with 
hard edges, whereas the airbrush tool will paint with soft edges and transitions. The paint tools 
can be divided into three groups: the basic set, specialized paint tools, and assistive paint tools. 
The basic set of paint tools includes the following: 
• 
Bucket Fill: Fills larger areas of the image with the same color 
• 
Blend: Creates a seamless transition from one color to another 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
176 
• 
Pencil: Draws lines with hard edges 
• 
Paintbrush: Draws lines with soft edges 
• 
Eraser: Removes strokes or parts of the drawing 
The following special paint tools also simulate their real-life counterparts: 
• 
Airbrush: Draws fuzzy lines 
• 
Ink: Writes lines calligraphy-style 
The third set of paint tools can be used as assistive paint tools. These tools help the painter 
render seamless transitions or apply particular effects to the painting. 
• 
Clone: Duplicates areas of the image 
• 
Heal: Removes small spots in photos 
• 
Perspective Clone: Duplicates areas of an image by keeping the perspective 
• 
Blur/Sharpen: Sharpens or blurs edges in a painting or photo 
• 
Smudge: Smears and creates seamless transitions between objects 
• 
Dodge/Burn: Lightens or darkens areas in an image 
Is This Chapter for Me? 
In this book, we distinguish painting from drawing. This distinction is important because of the 
way GIMP tools are used and how a chapter is applicable to you. 
Chapter 8 is most suitable if you are painting with a graphics tablet. Of course you can use a 
mouse to get the feel of digital painting. However for more serious digital artists using a pen with 
a graphics tablet will give you much greater control over your strokes. 
Chapter 9 will be suitable for the digital drawer, who uses GIMP tools to emulate free strokes. 
If you don’t own a graphics tablet, you can still create artwork—such as icons or small 
paintings—with GIMP. 
Digital Painting: The Advantages 
There are no messy brushes to clean, no paint to run or smudge and no wet canvases that could 
be accidentally stood on.  
Digital painting in GIMP provides the following: 
• 
A range of brushes, pencils, and airbrushes with options such as size, shape, tilt, 
pressure sensitivity, and opacity 
• 
A huge range of colors to choose from 
• 
The ability to redo or undo strokes with the press of a couple of keys 
• 
Layers for greater artistic control: use a background layer, sketch layer, color layer, 
blending layer, duplicate or inverse layer, filter layer, mode layer, and so on 
• 
The option to turn layers on or off to help the creative process 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
177 
• 
The ability to create and save brushes and options, if needed 
• 
The ability to copy, print, share, or publish projects to the internet 
The Canvas 
The canvas is a synonym for the digital image that you will paint on (see Figure 8-1). If you use 
GIMP with default settings, a newly created canvas will be white because the background color is 
white. 
Later in this chapter, we will introduce layers. 
 
Figure 8-1. A blank image; also known as a blank canvas 
Creating a New Canvas 
Similar to the real world, where you need a canvas to paint on, you also work on a canvas in 
GIMP. As first described in “Creating a Blank Image” in Chapter 2, a new canvas is created by 
performing the following steps. 
1. 
Open the Create New Image dialog box (see Figure 8-2). 
2. 
If you create a painting with the intention of printing it or using a lot of detail, create 
the image with a higher resolution and dimensions. Use a width and height that is 
bigger than 1000 pixels. 
3. 
Click the Advanced Options button to change the resolution of the painting. Use a 
resolution that is greater than 150 pixels per inch. Higher resolutions are important if 
you like to print your painting. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
178 
4. 
Click OK. 
 
Figure 8-2. The Create New Image dialog for creating a new canvas 
Navigation and Zooming 
Depending on your style of painting, you will need quick access to tools and different zoom 
levels, as well as the total screen space that you have available. 
How to Maximize the Work Area 
GIMP allows you to focus on your canvas without losing control of your dialogs and the toolbox. 
If you are not using the single-window mode, you can toggle between your canvas and dialogs by 
using the Tab key while painting. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
179 
When painting big images, you want to use as much of the screen you can. By pressing the 
F11 key, you can toggle quickly between a maximized canvas and the normal canvas size. 
Alternatively, you can also access View ➤ Fullscreen to achieve the same effect. 
Zooming and Panning the Work Area 
If you paint details, you sometimes need to zoom in very quickly or alternate between different 
zoom levels. Zoom levels are accessible with the following numbers on your keyboard: 
• 
1 (100%) 
• 
2 (200%) 
• 
3 (400%) 
• 
4 (800%) 
• 
5 (1600%) 
Furthermore, if you are working on details in your painting, you can pan the canvas by 
pressing the Space key on your keyboard or by using the second button on your pen, depending 
on the configuration. 
Color Basics 
The GIMP toolbox shows two color indicators (see Figure 8-3), representing the foreground and 
background colors. When creating a new image, GIMP uses the selected background as the 
canvas color. The foreground color will be determined by your selected paint tool. 
All basic paint tools make use of the foreground and background color, indicated by the 
toolbox. The foreground color is set to black and the background color is set to white by default. 
The paper resembles the white background color and the pencil the dark pencil color, similar to 
the real things.

Choosing a New Color: The Color Dialog 
A dialog box will appear if you click on the foreground or background color indicator in the 
toolbox (see Figure 8-4). The dialog provides different ways to choose a new color. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
181 
 
Figure 8-4. The color dialog to select either a foreground or background color 
Colors are represented by different color models—systems that use various ways to describe 
colors. GIMP shows colors for different systems in the left area of the dialog box. Each color 
system displays all the possible colors available on your computer. 
The Bucket Fill Tool 
The bucket fill tool can be used for filling large areas of an image, selections, and closed areas if 
you are painting comics, for example. By default, the tool uses the foreground color, which is 
black if you just started GIMP. You can select the bucket fill tool in the toolbox or press the 
SHIFT+B key combination. 
The tool is not only used to fill areas with the foreground or background colors; it also makes 
patterns that can be selected in the bucket fill tool options. You can access the tool options by 
double-clicking on the bucket fill tool icon in the toolbox. 
Changing the Background Color 
Changing the background color of the newly-created image with the bucket fill tool is easy. 
1. 
Create a blank image. (See the “Creating a Blank Image” section in Chapter 2 if you are 
unsure of how to create a new image.) By default, the foreground color is set to black; 
the background color is set to white. The background color of your image should now 
be white (see Figure 8-5).

and change the background color by selecting different foreground colors. 
Managing Colors: Palettes 
Color is a very important aspect in paintings. When painting, fairly often you need to switch 
between colors. GIMP provides functionality to manage the colors that you need to access again 
and again. Next, we will show you a variety of ways to select colors in GIMP. 
The Palettes Dialog 
To allow easy access, GIMP provides a way to save the colors that you’ve previously chosen. A 
range of colors can be saved in a color table, called a palette. The palette dialog allows you to 
browse pre-defined color tables. You access the palettes dialog from the image menu by selecting 
Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Palettes. 
As shown in Figure 8-9, the Default (23) palette is selected by default. The editor of the 
selected palette is opened by double-clicking. The number in parentheses next to the entry 
indicates the number of colors. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
185 
 
Figure 8-9. The palettes dialog  
The Palettes Editor 
The color information in the palettes dialog is accessible by double-clicking on a selected palette, 
which opens the palettes editor (see Figure 8-10). 
The editor works similar to the color dialog; the color you select in the editor will be set as the 
foreground color. The color picker tool completes the dialog, which is the central tool to add new 
colors to the palette. 
 
Figure 8-10. The palettes editor allows you to manage the colors you use frequently. 
■ Tip A palette is kept independently from an image. You can always use the same palette for different 
paintings. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
186 
The Color Picker Tool 
The color picker tool (see Figure 8-11) allows you to retrieve color values from your current 
image. This is very important during painting, as you may like to continue painting with a 
particular color from your image. 
By default, the color picker tool sets the foreground color indicator to the color that you 
apply it to. The tool options allow adjusting the behavior to either, as follows: 
• 
Pick only: Retrieves only the color information 
• 
Set the foreground- or background color indicator 
• 
Add to palette: Adds the selected color to the current palette 
 
Figure 8-11. The GIMP toolbox with the color picker tool selected. The mouse pointer changes to a pipette to

Creating a Palette with Colors 
Palettes allow easy access to the colors that you’re using to paint. We’ll show you how to manage 
your own palette.  

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP

5. 
Using the red foreground color, create a new palette entry by clicking on the “Create a 
new entry from the foreground color” button. A new color entry is created in the 
“Untitled” palette (see Figure 8-14). (If you click this button after GIMP started a new 
black color entry is created. By following this exercise, a new red color entry should 
appear.)

the color onto the Palette Editor. 
Becoming a Digital Painter: Using Paint Tools 
In this section we will show you how to use the basic paint tools to sketch and paint. 
The Eraser Tool 
The eraser in GIMP is a basic paint tool. The tool’s preliminary function is to change the pixel 
color to the background color in order to simulate an “erasing” effect. By default, the eraser uses a 
fuzzy shape for painting. 
■ Tip Do not confuse the eraser tool with the undo functionality. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
189 
How to Erase 
To use the full potential of the eraser tool, you will need to understand how the tool works. 
1. 
Create a new image. Verify the two color indicators in the toolbox: the background 
color indicator should be white and the foreground color indicator black. 
2. 
Change the foreground color to red by clicking on the foreground color indicator in the 
toolbox. Choose a red color from the color panel in the color dialog and click OK. (If 
you are unsure about how to do this, see the “Changing the Background Color” 
exercise.) 
3. 
Select the bucket fill tool from the toolbox. 
4. 
Fill the image with the red foreground color by clicking on the canvas (see Figure 8-15).

6. 
Draw a line on the red canvas. You should see that the eraser “paints” white because 
the background color has not been changed and still shows white (see Figure 8-16). 
 
Figure 8-16. The eraser uses the selected background color, which is white by default  
7. 
Now change the background color by clicking on the background color indicator. In 
the color dialog, select a dark color and click OK (see Figure 8-17). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
191 
 
Figure 8-17. The background color indicator immediately reflects the color selection in the color 
dialog. 
8. 
Draw another line on the red canvas. As you can see, now the eraser will paint with a 
dark background color (see Figure 8-18). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
192 
 
Figure 8-18. After changing the background color, the eraser now paints with a dark color instead of the 
default white. 
The Paintbrush Tool 
The paintbrush tool uses a soft-edged brush shape by default. Therefore, it is ideal for sketching 
and painting. 
Controlling Your Brush Size, Shape, and Angle 
You’ve already had a quick introduction to the brush and scale tool options. Now it is time to 
learn more about the tool options and how they can help you paint. 
The tool options for the paint tools allow altering how the brush you’re painting with 
behaves in size and shape. If you own a graphics tablet, most of the tool options are controlled by 
the tablet itself and you can simply start painting. For example, the size of the brush will increase 
or decrease with the amount of physical pressure you apply to the tablet pen. But still, you need 
to control the initial size and the shape of your brush. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
193 
Brush Shape 
The brush option in the tool options dialog allows you to pick a brush shape. This can be 
compared to the brush that you pick as a painter in real life. It influences how you paint (see 
Figure 8-19). GIMP provides different brush shapes. You can choose a new brush by clicking on 
the shape indicator and selecting another brush from the dialog. 
The “Doing More with Brushes” section later in this chapter goes into more detail about 
creating brushes.

calligraphic, acrylic) 
Size 
The size option allows you to control the size of the brush. This option is the best way to get a very 
tiny or a very large brush shape to paint with. 
Aspect Ratio 
With this option, you can twist and bend the brush shape into various degrees, altering the way 
the brush will paint. Figure 8-20 illustrates how the brush shape changes when you change the 
aspect ratio in the tool options.

Angle 
The angle controls the rotation of the brush shape. If you select circular brushes, this option will 
not have a real affect of the brush, because rotating circles will not change the brush. If you 
choose different brush shapes, you will be able to rotate the brush and influence the painting 
functionality. 
■ Tip If you changed a lot of the options in the tool options dialog and you want to return to the GIMP 
default, use the “Reset to default” icon located on the bottom-right of the tool options dialog. You can also 
reset all tool options in the Preferences dialog, which you can access through Edit ➤ Preferences. 
Sketching 
Digital painting is almost similar to painting with real colors on canvas. It is recommended to 
create a sketch first, before you add any color to your painting and refine it. There is no 
recommended tool suitable for sketching. Choose either pencil or paintbrush or whatever suits 
your sketching needs. 
1. 
Create a new canvas with a width and height of 1500 pixels or more by using the Create 
a New Image dialog (see Figure 8-21).

2. 
Select the paintbrush tool and open the tool options. If you can’t see the tool options 
dialog, double-click the paintbrush tool icon in the toolbox to open the dialog (see 
Figure 8-22).

3. 
Verify the brush shape in the paintbrush tool options. The shape of the brush should 
be set to Round (see Figure 8-23). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
196 
Click and select the
“Round” brush.
 
Figure 8-23. Select the Round brush, as this will give you enough “fuzziness” without making 
your sketches look dull. 
4. 
The size of the brush should be very small. You can mark the current value with the 
mouse and enter “1” or slide the bar to the left with a pressed mouse button (see 
Figure 8-24). Verify that the Dynamics option is set to “Basic Dynamics” if you use a 
graphics tablet. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
197 
Decrease the brush
size by sliding the
bar to the left.
 
Figure 8-24. Decreasing the brush size is important, as it will allow you to sketch with a thin line. 
5. 
Start sketching an object found in your living room or kitchen (for example, an apple 
or an orange). Keep the sketch very basic and the details to a minimum, like those 
shown in Figure 8-25. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP

Figure 8-25. Example sketches 
The sketching abilities of GIMP are limitless. Figure 8-26 shows more advanced sketches you 
can create. The more you practice sketching, the more you get a feel on how much detail you 
want to put in your sketches.

Doing More with Brushes 
Although GIMP provides a wide range of different brushes for you to paint with, it may be 
necessary to create your own custom brush shape. 
The Brush Selection Dialog 
We’ve already introduced how to select different brush shapes. The brushes dialog is accessible 
from the paint tool options and allows you to create your own brush shapes (see Figure 8-27). You 
can obtain the brush selection dialog by selecting Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Brushes or 
pressing SHIFT+CTRL+B. 
Create a New Shape
 
Figure 8-27. The brushes dialog 
■ Note The default brush shapes in GIMP cannot be customized. You will need to create your own brush 
shape. 
Create a New Brush Shape 
The default brushes shipped with GIMP cannot be edited. If you like to tweak your own artistic 
brushes, create a copy of an existing brush and change it to fit your own needs. 
1. 
Open the brush selection dialog. 
2. 
Click the “Create new brush” button. The brush editor dialog will appear (see  
Figure 8-28). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP

Figure 8-28. The brush editor dialog showing a newly created, diamond-shaped brush with 13 
spikes and a high hardness value 
3. 
Choose the basic shape of the brush as a circle, square, or diamond. 
4. 
Depending on which brush you’re trying to create, play with the editor’s options to 
finalize your brush shape. 
5. 
Switch to the brush selection dialog once you are satisfied with your brush shape. The 
new brush is automatically saved. 
6. 
Create a new image and try your new brush shape. 
Brush Shape Attributes 
Figures 8-29, 8-30, and 8-31 show a few, handpicked brush attributes and how they influence the 
painting style. 
Hardness 
Software brushes paint more subtly than real brushes. Use a soft brush to create very soft edges 
or to blend colors. Use a hard brush for outlines of objects. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
201 
 
Figure 8-29. The difference between a hard and a soft brush. 
Aspect Ratio/Spikes 
Spikes attached to brushes paint more artistically than simple, rounded brushes. Use a high 
aspect ratio to emphasize the spikes more. 
 
Figure 8-30. A brush with five spikes; the left line uses a small aspect ratio, the right line uses a high aspect 
ratio 
Spacing 
Small spacing creates a seamless line, while big-brush spacing creates dotted lines. You typically 
want small spacing for sketching and painting. 
 
Figure 8-31. The difference between a small spacing and a big spacing 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
202 
Layers 
Layers in GIMP allow you to paint an image with more flexibility. Chapter 6 gave a basic 
introduction on how to use layers. This section will show you what you need to know about layers 
specifically for painting. 
The Canvas Revised 
In the beginning of this chapter, you learned that the “canvas” is a synonym for the digital image 
that you are painting on. 
The canvas in GIMP will provide by default one layer—the background layer. That’s why you 
have two menus in the image menu: Image and Layer. All layers created compose the image.  
For example, you can resize the canvas, which will not resize all layers. In turn, you can resize 
one layer, which will not affect the size of other layers or the size of the image itself. 
As shown in Figure 8-32, the size of a layer is always bound by the size of the image; 
therefore, the size of the digital image on the top of the illustration remains the same, even 
though one layer is larger than all layers and the image. An image size can be larger than all 
layers, as shown at the bottom half of Figure 8-32, which results in a larger image, although it can 
hold smaller-sized layers. 
 
Figure 8-32. Layers in regard to the digital image, or canvas  
Repositioning the Canvas 
You often need to reposition the canvas because you need more space. If you simply start 
sketching on a blank canvas, you will paint on the background layer.  

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
203 
1. 
Open one of your sketches. If you don’t have one, simply create a new image and use 
the default width and height of 610 × 377 pixels in the Create a New Image dialog (see 
Figure 8-33). 
 
Figure 8-33. The canvas before repositioning; there is not enough room to add any shadows to the 
sketched teapot  
2. 
Select the Move tool from the toolbox window, or press the M key (see Figure 8-34). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
204 
 
Figure 8-34. The toolbox with the Move tool selected 
3. 
Use the Move tool to reposition your image. Click on the image, press and hold the left 
mouse button, and move the image to where you want it repositioned. Release the left 
mouse button when you are confident you reached the right position (see Figure 8-35). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
205 
 
Figure 8-35. Move the canvas in the middle of the image. 
4. 
You will now see parts of the canvas as a checkerboard and you will not be able to 
paint. Therefore, you need to resize your canvas to the image size (see Figure 8-36). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
206 
 
Figure 8-36. The repositioned canvas after the layer has been resized 
5. 
Select Layer ➤ Layer to Image Size. 
■ Note If you created more than one layer in an image, you can also reduce all layers to one background 
layer. This is called flattening an image, which will resize any layer in the image. It is a solution if you don’t 
need more than the background layer. To flatten an image, select Image ➤ Flatten Image. 
Resizing the Canvas 
From time to time, it is necessary to resize the canvas to add more painting space. This can be 
easily achieved with the Canvas Size dialog. 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
207 
■ Note Scaling will increase or decrease the size of the painting, whereas resizing will add or remove 
painting space from the image.  
1. 
Open an image or create a new image with the default sizes of 610 × 377 pixels in the 
Create a New Image dialog (see Figure 8-37). 
 
Figure 8-37. The canvas before we resize it; if we want to add more objects to the painting, we 
will need to add more canvas space. 
2. 
Resize the canvas by selecting Image ➤ Canvas Size. 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
208 
3. 
The dialog allows you to change the canvas size. Increase the size by entering bigger 
values in the width box. Make sure the chain icon isn’t broken because it keeps the 
aspect ratio of the image (see Figure 8-38). 
 
Figure 8-38. The Set Image Canvas Size dialog 
4. 
Decide the position of the background layer on the new, resized canvas. Center the 
background layer by clicking on the Center button. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP

6. 
Select Layer ➤ Layer to Image Size (see Figure 8-40). 
 
Figure 8-40. The resized canvas with more painting space 
Managing Layers with the Layer Dialog 
The Layers dialog is opened by default when GIMP starts (see Figure 8-41). You can open the 
layer dialog again by pressing CTRL+l or selecting Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Layers from 
the image menu. When you create a new image, the layer dialog shows one layer, called 
Background. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
211 
 
Figure 8-41. The layer dialog showing the background layer  
The background layer is created with every new canvas. All other layers are added on top of 
the current selected layer.  
Hiding Layers 
Layers can be hidden; either by using the eye icon next to the layer title or by reducing the opacity 
of the layer to a minimum (see Figure 8-42). By hiding layers, you can try different compositions 
of image elements without exporting them to different images. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
212 
 
Figure 8-42. All layers are visible in the left image; the color layer is hidden in the right image 
Coloring Your Sketch 
Now that you’ve learned how to use GIMP to create a sketch, it is now time to apply color to the 
sketch. Make use of the layer dialog, as this will make it easier to leave your sketch untouched, but 
try different colors. 
1. 
Create a new image. 
2. 
Create a new layer in the layer dialog. The label should be “sketch” and the fill type 
should be transparent.  
3. 
Create a new sketch on the newly-created “sketch” layer (see Figure 8-43). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
213 
 
Figure 8-43. An example sketch to illustrate the coloring process 
4. 
Depending on what you want to paint, adding color may not be as easy as it appears. 
Try to focus on picking the right color and start coloring the biggest areas. (It is 
advisable to create a new palette for your painting, but not necessary.) 
5. 
Choose a new foreground color by clicking on the foreground color indicator. 
6. 
Resize the brush to a medium size in comparison to the painting. Once again, you 
don’t want to paint details. 
7. 
Create a new layer, name it Color. Move this layer below your sketch layer to use your 
sketch as a guide (see Figure 8-44). 
 
Figure 8-44. Apply the color in its own layer, below your sketch; that way you can use your sketch 
as a guide. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
214 
8. 
Start applying the color. 
9. 
Pick different shades of the color that you are applying, depending on your painting 
(see Figure 8-45). If you use a palette, always register the new color in your palette. If 
you don’t use a palette, just use a small color dot in one edge of your painting; that 
way, you can always pick your color again. 
■ Tip To quickly toggle between pipette and paint tool, hold CTRL pressed. This will change to the pipette 
tool with which you can set the foreground color indicator. 
 
Figure 8-45. The colored sketch without colored details 
Doing More with Layers 
Layers can be a very extensive topic in image manipulation, especially because their ability to 
keep image elements separate makes them so useful. The following sections will show you more 
advanced uses of layers. 
Select the Outline of the Painting 
While sketching or applying colors to your painting, it sometimes becomes necessary to select the 
outline of the painting on a specific layer. To help with this, GIMP provides a selection method 
called Alpha to Selection. 
■ Note This method will only work on transparent layers, as GIMP uses transparency to distinguish the 
outline of the painting from the layer. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
215 
1. 
Open the image with the painting that you’d like to use (see Figure 8-46). 
 
Figure 8-46. Selecting the painting layer (with a transparent background) and the background 
layer (solid color) 
2. 
Select the layer from which you would like to perform a selection of the painting 
outlines. 
3. 
Select on Layer ➤ Transparency ➤ Alpha to Selection. You will now see a selection 
appear around the painting (see Figure 8-47). 
 
Figure 8-47. A selection based on the transparency information of the layer, which can be the 
outline of the painting 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
216 
■ Note This method will also select half-transparent pixels. You will need to adjust the selection if it 
happens. See Chapter 9 for more information about how to use selections for drawing. 
Exchanging Paintings Between Layers 
While painting, it is possible to cut and paste painted elements into other layers. This is very 
useful, as sometimes you want a strict separation between shadows, colors, and your sketch. With 
this method, you can rectify mistakes like coloring on the wrong layer. 
Before you can exchange paintings between layers, you will need to select your painting.  
1. 
Create a selection of the painting that you would like to exchange. 
2. 
Cut the selected area with either Edit ➤ Cut or CTRL+X (see Figure 8-48). 
 
Figure 8-48. The painting has been cut out; only the selection border remains. 
3. 
Select the layer that you want to paste the painted area into (see Figure 8-49). This 
should be a different layer. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
217 
 
Figure 8-49. The layer labeled “Only Color” is selected and filled with white for demonstration 
purposes 
4. 
Remove the selection by choosing Select ➤ None. 
5. 
Paste what you have cut with either Edit ➤ Paste or CTRL+V. A “floating selection” will 
appear (see Figure 8-50). 
 
Figure 8-50. The pasted painting appears as a floating selection in the layer menu. This can be 
very frustrating for new users who are not aware that it behaves like a layer. 
6. 
Select the Move tool from the toolbox or choose Tools ➤ Transform Tools ➤ Move. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
218 
7. 
Select your painting to move it around by holding your left mouse button pressed. 
Keep an eye on the layer dialog to be sure you move the correct layer. 
8. 
 Anchor the selection by clicking either outside of the floating selection boundaries or 
by selecting Layer ➤ Anchor Layer. 
■ Note Anchoring the layer is a very tricky part and needs patience to master it. 
Repositioning a Layer 
Similar to repositioning a canvas, layers can be repositioned too. Often, you start to sketch out an 
item on your background or first layer and need to reposition it. 
This exercise works best with an image containing more than one layer. You may open one of 
your previous sketches.  
1. 
Open the layers dialog by selecting Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Layers or pressing 
CTRL+L. 
2. 
Create a new layer. You should now have at least two layers. Select the top layer. Fill 
this layer with a dark color using the bucket fill tool. 
3. 
Select the Move tool from the toolbox window or press M. 
4. 
Use the Move tool to reposition your layer. Click on the layer, press and hold the left 
mouse button, and move in the direction where you want your layer repositioned. 
Release the left mouse button. 
5. 
Resize your layer to the image by selecting Layer ➤ Layer to Image Size. 
Problems with Layers 
For any potential problems that may arise regarding layers, Table 8-1 provides quick help tips. 
Table 8-1. Layers Help Tips 
Symptom 
Solution 
You are unable to paint, no 
matter which paint tool you 
choose. 
Verify that at least one layer is available in the layer dialog; if 
not, create a new layer. Check that not all the layers are set 
to hidden. 
You can’t paint on transparent 
areas. 
Make sure that the “lock” option is set for the current 
selected layer. 
Whenever I try to move my layer 
with the move tool, I accidentally 
move the background layer. 
With transparent areas in layers, it is easy to pick the wrong 
layer with the Move tool. Make sure you select a solid part of 
the layer not the transparent area. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
219 
Filling in the Details 
You are constantly picking different colors and different hues of a color to add details to your 
painting. More detail can be added to the painting by using the paintbrush tool. GIMP provides 
the following three paint tools to make your life easier: 
• 
Smudge: Blends colors 
• 
Blur/Sharpen: Refines the depth of objects 
• 
Dodge/Burn: Darkens colors or adds highlights 
Blending Colors 
You started adding colors in the “Coloring your Sketch” exercise. 
For the refining task of the sketch you need to know which tools to use to blend colors 
together. For this task the smudge tool and the blur/sharpen tool can be used. Both tools allow 
blending colors in a different manner (see Figure 8-51). 
 
Figure 8-51. Illustration of using the blur tool (left) and the smudge tool (right). The blur tool only blurs the 
edges of a spot until a maximum, whereas you can smudge edges continuously. 
The blur tool is used to blur edges or make objects of a painting disappear in the background. 
The smudge tool allows you to blend colors together. 
Tool Options: Rate 
The blur and smudge tool options has a “Rate” slider at the bottom of the dialog. If you increase 
the rate, GIMP will blend more colors under the smudge brush. If you decrease the rate, GIMP 
will, obviously, blend fewer colors. Or, in other words, a smaller rate blends less than a higher 
rate. Keep that in mind if you want to be very cautious in blending colors together. 
How to Blend Colors with the Smudge Tool 
This exercise will show you how to blend colors with the smudge tool. 
1. 
Load one of your colored sketches. 
2. 
Choose the smudge tool and slowly smudge the colors together. Add new details in 
form of new colors and continue smudging. 
3. 
Continue with refining by adding new color. Smudge/blend the colors together until 
the sketch becomes a seamless shape (see Figure 8-52). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
220 
 
Figure 8-52. Blending colors with the smudge tool 
Blending colors can be a cumbersome task and may take a long time. You will need patience 
and practice for this though, as you will start with a “blurry” looking object. Keep on adding 
details and refine them. 
■ Tip Use the Lock option in the Layers dialog to prevent smudging your paint into transparent areas. This 
option is very useful if you divide your painting into separate layers. 
Lightening and Darkening Colors 
The Dodge/Burn tool is widely used to manipulate the exposure of objects in a photo, but it can 
also be very useful to manipulate the colors of your painting. The main difference between dodge 
and burn is that the dodge mode will lighten color areas, whereas the burn mode will darken 
color areas (see Figure 8-53). 
 
Figure 8-53. The effects of dodge (left) and burn (right) to add depth to a plain circle  

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
221 
In Figure 8-53, a “round fuzzy” brush shape was used to add highlights on the left circle, 
which turns it into a sphere. On the right circle, shadows were added with the burn mode. 
Tool Options: Range 
Colors can be lightened and darkened at different levels, which is reflected by the range setting in 
the Dodge/Burn tool options. 
• 
Shadows affect the majority of lighter areas. In dodge mode, colors become “lighter” 
until they are white. In burn mode, colors become “darker” until they are black. 
• 
Midtones affect the majority of middle tones. In dodge mode, colors get less hue. In 
burn mode, colors get more hue. 
• 
Highlights affect the majority of darker areas. In dodge mode, colors get less hue. In 
burn mode, colors get more hue. 
■ Tip If you are unsure which mode will best fit your needs, stay with the default of the tool, the Midtones 
option. 
What makes this tool so special (compared to other GIMP functionalities) in darkening or 
lightening an image? You can adjust the pressure and the size and, therefore, control the affected 
area of the image. Furthermore, the Dodge/Burn tool can be applied accumulatively to paint a 
gradient from lighter to darker colors. 
Re-using Tool Options: The Tool Presets Dialog 
If you are frequently changing tools during your painting sessions, the tool presets dialog can be 
very helpful. Tool Presets is found under Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Tool Presets. For 
example if you choose a paint brush preset, the brush, the brush size and the brush shape can be 
preset. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ DIGITAL ART: PAINTING IN GIMP 
222 
 
Figure 8-54. The Tool Presets Dialog 
Choose each preset by clicking on the entry in the dialog. GIMP changes the tool and it's 
option. 
Summary 
In this chapter, we introduced you to using GIMP for digital painting. Similar to painting on an 
actual canvas, we showed you how to create sketches, add color, and make final touches to your 
painting. The use of layers can be very beneficial to the digital painter. If you don’t own a graphics 
tablet, Chapter 9 will introduce you to digital art using GIMP alone.

Digital Art: Drawing in GIMP 
Digital art can be created in many different ways, with many different tools. You can create digital 
art without freehand painting and a graphics tablet. This chapter will show you how you can 
create digital art with GIMP’s tools. 
In This Chapter 
• 
How to draw in GIMP 
• 
Draw with selections 
• 
Drawing freely 
• 
Paint without a tablet 
How to Draw in GIMP 
In principle, all painting tools can be used for drawing, too. How can you create geometric forms 
with only a mouse and no assistive tools like a drawing pad? It can be achieved by doing any of 
the following: 
• 
Drawing freehand aided by GIMP (for example, straight lines) 
• 
Creating a selection that reflects any geometric form (for example, circles, ellipses, or 
squares) and filling or stroking the outline with a paint tool 
• 
Emulating the painting with the dedicated paths tool 
You can also refer to Chapter 8, where we introduced every aspect of choosing foreground 
colors and paint tools, as well as navigating your workspace.  

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
224 
Tools for Drawing 
All paint tools under Tools ➤ Paint Tools can be used for drawing. Most of the paint tools are 
more suitable for painting with a graphics tablet, but the following can be used for drawing with 
GIMP utilizing a mouse: 
• 
Pencil: Draws lines with hard edges 
• 
Paintbrush: Draws lines with soft edges 
• 
Eraser: Removes strokes or parts of the drawing 
• 
Airbrush: Draws fuzzy lines 
• 
Ink: Writes calligraphy style lines 
• 
Bucket Fill: Fills areas with a color 
Size and Shapes 
Every paint tool provides tool options, which allow tuning every bit of the paint tool (see Figure 9-
1). The size you are drawing with and the shape of the brush will be most important to you. 
 
Figure 9-1. The tool options give you quick access to change the shape and size of your current brush. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
225 
Changing the Size and Shape of a Paint Tool 
The mouse cursor in GIMP always shows a visual representation of the selected paint tool when 
you move the cursor over the canvas. The selected brush size and shape is also shown (see Figure 
9-2). This makes it easy to change the size in the tool options quickly. 
 
Figure 9-2. The shape and size of the current brush is displayed when you hover your mouse over the image. 
1. 
Create a new image. 
2. 
Select a paint tool under Tools ➤ Paint Tools. You can select the Pencil, if you are 
unsure what to use. 
3. 
Move the mouse cursor over the white area of the canvas. You will notice the helping 
cursor showing the size of the brush. 
4. 
Open the paint tool options by double-clicking on the tool icon in the toolbox. 
5. 
Slide and change the size entry. For every change, move the cursor over the canvas to 
see the change of the brush size. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
226 
The Bucket Fill Tool 
The bucket fill tool allows you to fill areas of your image or selection. It uses the foreground color 
by default, which is black. The area that is filled is determined by what is bordered by the filling 
color. This can be the whole image (for example, if the image is white), a selection, or contrast, as 
illustrated in Figure 9-3. 
 
Figure 9-3. An area filled with the bucket fill tool. The black-painted pencil lines form a bounding box, which 
allows you to fill only parts of the image. 
The Eraser Tool 
The eraser in GIMP is a basic paint tool. The tool’s preliminary function is to change the pixels 
color to the background color to simulate an “erasing” effect. By default, the eraser uses a fuzzy 
shape for painting. 
■ Note Do not confuse the eraser tool with the undo functionality. 
How to Erase 
Please see page 188 if you are unsure how to use the eraser tool. 
Drawing with Selections 
Basic geometric figures are created with the help of selections in GIMP. Selections can be filled or 
stroked. Furthermore, selections can be combined as well as divided, which allows drawing 
composed geometric figures. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
227 
Figures are always drawn by creating new selections and filling them with either a 
foreground or background color. In Figure 9-4, the selection is created (left) with editable 
borders; it can still be changing in size and shape. Once you are satisfied with the size and shape, 
create the selection (middle), and fill it with the bucket fill tool (right) and a selected foreground 
color. 
 
Figure 9-4. The process of drawing with selections (from left to right)  
 
Figure 9-5. The selection is indicated by alternating black and white stripes, which look like marching ants. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP

Selection Tools 
Selections are created with the selection tools, which can be found under Tools ➤ Selection Tools 
in the image menu. All selection tools provide tool options and their behavior can be adjusted. 
The following selection tools can be used to create basic geometric figures: 
• 
Rectangle Select 
• 
Ellipse Select 
• 
Free Select (under certain circumstances) 
The exercises that follow demonstrate drawing with selections created by the Ellipse Select tool. If 
you want to create a square selection, the steps are analogous with the Rectangle Select tool. 
Creating an Elliptic Selection 
Ellipses are created with the help of the Ellipse Select Tool. First, the selections are created and 
then, depending on what you are after, filled or stroked. 
1. 
Create a new image in GIMP. 
 
Figure 9-6. An elliptic selection is easily created by drawing an imaginary path (black arrow) by 
holding the left mouse button. 
2. 
Select the Ellipse Select tool in the toolbox or press E. 
3. 
Create a new selection by clicking and holding the mouse button while you drag the mouse 
to either side of the image (see Figure 9-6). A helping square is displayed around the 
selection. If you are satisfied, click the image again to create the selection. You will now see 
a selection with “marching ants” surrounding the selection (see Figure 9-7). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
229 
 
Figure 9-7. Hover your mouse pointer over the edges of the selection to see the helping square.  
4. 
To draw an elliptic outline, choose Select ➤ Border. Type in the size of the border and 
click OK. Fill the created border with the bucket fill tool by clicking in the border (see 
Figure 9-8 and Figure 9-9). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
230 
 
Figure 9-8. A border is easily created around the ellipsis. 
 
Figure 9-9. Fill the border with the bucket fill tool. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
231 
Creating a Circle 
Circles are created with elliptic selections. The following exercise alters an elliptic selection into a 
circle by locking the aspect ratio. 
1. 
Create a new elliptic selection with the Ellipse Selection tool described in the section 
“Create an Elliptic Selection”. 
 
Figure 9-10. By locking in the aspect ratio by 1:1 in the selection tool options, you can create 
even-sized selections, such as circles. 
2. 
Open the tool option dialog of the Ellipse Selection tool. Select the option labeled 
Fixed:, which should be set to “Aspect ratio” by default. 
3. 
Type an aspect ratio of 1:1, as shown in the entry box in Figure 9-11. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
232 
 
Figure 9-11. By resizing, the ellipsis becomes a circle. 
4. 
Resize the elliptic selection by dragging a corner to any direction with your mouse. You 
created a circular selection (see Figure 9-11). 
5. 
Fill the selection by using the bucket fill tool and clicking inside the circled selection 
(see Figure 9-12). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
233 
 
Figure 9-12. Fill the selection by using the bucket fill tool. 
Doing More with Selections 
Basic selections can be combined with new selections. You can create many different shapes with 
that in mind. 
Selection Modes 
Each selection tool can be set to a specific mode. The default mode is set to “Replace the current 
selection.” This always creates a new selection to avoid confusion. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
234 
 
Figure 9-13. A variety of selection modes illustrated from top to bottom: add, subtract, and intersect. Two 
circle selections for each mode have been filled. 
You will most likely practice with different selection modes in order to create composed 
geometric objects and to get familiar with the modes benefits. The following exercise will help 
you start playing with the selection modes. 
Creating Composed Forms with Selections 
This exercise uses two modes: combine and subtract. 
1. 
Create a new image in GIMP. 
2. 
Create a new selection, as described in the “Creating a Circle” section.  
3. 
Open the tool options for the selection tool by double-clicking on the tool icon in the 
toolbox. 
4. 
Switch the selection mode to “Add to the current selection.” 
5. 
Draw a new selection that overlaps the current selection. Create the selection with a 
single mouse-click (see Figure 9-14). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
235 
 
Figure 9-14. Create a new selection next to the first circle to let it overlap. 
6. 
Focus on the tool options again. Now you will remove part of the selection by 
switching the selection mode to “Subtract from the current selection.” 
7. 
Draw a new selection that overlaps the current selection (see Figure 9-15). 
 
Figure 9-15. In subtract mode, the new selection creates a circular “hole.” 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
236 
8. 
Create an outline or fill the selection (see Figure 9-16). 
 
Figure 9-16. Use the bucket fill tool to fill the selection. 
■ Tip Make sure you always reset the selection mode to “Replace the current selection,” because other 
selection modes may result in undesirable selections in later GIMP sessions. 
Drawing Freely 
GIMP provides helping hands if you are drawing freely to create simple geometric figures. 
Drawing a Straight Line 
Straight lines can be drawn with any painting tool. As an example, we show you how to draw a 
straight line by using the pencil. 
1. 
Create a new image. 
2. 
Choose the pencil or paint tool of your choice. Press N or select Tools ➤ Paint Tools ➤ 
Pencil. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
237 
 
Figure 9-17. A straight line starts with a single point, which you create with a single mouse-click. 
3. 
With a single mouse-click, create the first point of the line somewhere on the canvas 
(see Figure 9-17). 
 
Figure 9-18. While you hold the Shift key, a line connects the mouse pointer and the first point. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
238 
4. 
Hold the Shift key while making the second point, which, with a single mouse-click, 
marks the end of the line (see Figure 9-18 amd Figure 9-19). 
 
Figure 9-19. A straight line made by holding the Shift key 
■ Tip You can create consecutive line segments by simply continuously creating points with a mouse click 
on the canvas, while holding the SHIFT key pressed. 
Pixel Art 
Chapter 3 introduced the pixel—the smallest element in a digital image. Pixel art is a digital art 
form using the smallest element in an image. This art originates from the early forms of computer 
graphics. It was used for icons in operating systems and games. The art form is based on the pixel, 
which makes it distinguishable from a real-world painting because printouts can look blocky. The 
art is now used in all kinds of computer application icons. The images can either look flat or 
mimic a 3D effect, which is called isometric. 
What to Avoid 
Before creating your first pixel art masterpiece, there is one hint you should follow: avoid creating 
jagged lines. Pixels placed symmetrically are rendered crisp on your display; the eye picks up 
misplaced pixels very easily. Lines can look jagged and the image will not look nice (see Figure  
9-20). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
239 
 
Figure 9-20. Close up, the pixels that compose the lines are not symmetrical (illustrated in red), which will 
give a jagged or uneven impression from a distance. 
What to Draw 
Diagonal lines drawn with the same number of pixels look sharper and crisper. Art composed of 
symmetrical aligned pixels will look nice and crisp (see Figure 9-21). 
 
 
Figure 9-21. If you create diagonal lines, draw the diagonal increment with the same number of pixels. 
Using Depth in Pixel Art 
Isometric pixel art uses the isometric perspective to create images with depth. Most of these 
images had a part in early computer games. The images are very small, similar to icons, which 
allow you to put a lot of detail into the art—making them almost look like toys. 
Figure 9-22 illustrates why it is important to arrange pixels symmetric. The image on the left 
uses symmetric arranged pixels which lead to a very clean and crisp image on the display. The 
image on the right uses asymmetrically-arranged pixels, which leads to a distorted image. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
240 
 
Figure 9-22. Pixel art with depth added to it, also called an isometric view  
Drawing a Simple Isometric Box 
Drawing a box is the simplest geometric object. Most geometric forms in isometric pixel art use a 
box as its imaginary base model. 
Basically, you create the frame, color the frame, and add highlights and shadows.  
1. 
Create a blank, white canvas with File ➤ New. 
2. 
Choose the Pencil tool and open the tool options. Verify that the pencil tool size option 
is set to the lowest setting (1.00) and a Round Brush shape is chosen. Set the Dynamics 
option to “Dynamics Off” because you need a hard-painting pencil. (The “Size and 
Shapes” section at the beginning of this chapter can show you how to do that.) 
3. 
Because you may use the eraser often, make sure you have set the Eraser tool to the 
lowest brush size (1.00). With this tool also, set the Dynamics option to “Dynamics 
Off.” 
4. 
Set the zoom level to the highest setting: View ➤ Zoom ➤ 16:1. While drawing, you can 
constantly switch back to the normal zoom level to see the pixel drawing evolving. 
5. 
Choose a black foreground color. (This should be the default.) 
6. 
Start drawing a simple square (see Figure 9-23). 
 
Figure 9-23. Start by drawing the front side of the box. 
7. 
Create diagonal lines to add depth to the square (see Figure 9-24). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
241 
 
Figure 9-24. If you start with pixel art, draw the diagonal lines pixel by pixel. 
The box is now almost finished, but the coloring can make the difference between a 
dull object and a sophisticated-looking object. You will continue now by adding 
highlights and shadows to the box. 
8. 
Choose a color to fill two sides of the box. Depending on where you imagine the light will 
come from, leave one box for a darker color—the shadowed part of the box (see Figure 9-25). 
 
Figure 9-25. Fill the sides of the boxes with the bucket fill tool. 
9. 
Choose a darker color and fill the final side of the box with this darker color (see Figure 9-26). 
 
Figure 9-26. One side will be darker to simulate a shadow. 
10. Choose a lighter color and redraw the inner edge sides. This will make the box look 
“plastic” (see Figure 9-27). 
 
Figure 9-27. Paint the inner edges of the box with a brighter color; this creates a plastic look. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
242 
11. If you want to make the edges shinier, tip the edge with a very bright, almost white 
color. 
 
Figure 9-28. To make the corner shiny, use a very bright color that is almost white. 
12. Set the zoom level to 100% to see the box in a normal size. 
Creating a Simple Isometric House 
As a final example, we will show you how to create a simple house. You should be able to extend 
your virtual world from there. 
1. 
Create a new image in GIMP. 
2. 
Choose the Pencil tool, scale the brush size to the lowest setting (1.00), and make sure 
you do this with the Eraser tool as well. Choose the highest zoom option. (See the 
“Drawing a Simple Isometric Box” tutorial to prepare your working area.) 
3. 
Create a new transparent layer in the layer dialog. It will help you keep your drawing 
off the background so that you can paint the background independently (for example, 
place your house on the moon?) 
4. 
Draw the outlines of the house by using two pixels. This will be much like drawing a 
simple box, depending on the shape of the house. 
 
Figure 9-29. Start by drawing the frame of the house. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
243 
5. 
Create a new layer. This will be used for drawing the roof. Because the roof will be 
tilted slightly upwards, you need a layer to toy around with drawing pixels. It will also 
be easier for you to position the roof on top of the house with the Move tool (see Figure 
9-30). 
■ Note Positioning transparent layers with thin lines is tricky because you need to pick the exact position 
of the line otherwise, the Move tool picks the background layer by default. A high zoom will make this 
operation easier. 
 
Figure 9-30. Reduce the opacity of the background layer (the box) to assist in positioning the roof 
correctly while stilling drawing the black pixels for the roof. 
6. 
So far we used two pixels for the side lines. Try to use three or four pixels for the roof 
lines to create the impression of being more angular. Again, this is up to you and what 
you find looking good (see Figure 9-31). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
244 
 
Figure 9-31. The basic structure of the house without coloring 
7. 
Use the Move tool to move around the roof in case you need to reposition it. You may 
still need to make a few adjustments, but you can also do so during or after coloring 
the image. 
Coloring 
After you established the outline of the house, you color it and add highlights and shading.  
1. 
Choose a color for the house. If you like a house that is made of wood, choose a 
brownish foreground color. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
245 
 
Figure 9-32. Coloring, started with the roof 
2. 
Start by filling the roof of the house with a color (for example, choose brown for wood). 
(See Figure 9-32.) Because you have created the roof on its own layer, you can fill the 
complete roof area without taking care of intersecting lines. Continue by also filling the 
sides of the house. If the door is shut, also fill the front side with a color. 
3. 
Add highlights to draw the wood. Use the Pencil and choose a brighter version of the 
foreground color. Paint horizontal lines every three or four pixels. Use the straight line 
technique from “Drawing a Straight Line” (see Figure 9-33).  
■ Tip When drawing with the Pencil tool, you can quickly select the foreground color by holding the CTRL 
key and clicking on the pixel you want the foreground color to match. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
246 
 
Figure 9-33. Bright and dark lines next to each other simulate depth. 
4. 
Choose a darker version of the foreground color and paint straight lines next to the 
brighter lines. This creates a depth effect. 
5. 
Now concentrate on the roof and create the same effect by using a brighter color and a 
darker color (see Figure 9-34). 
 
Figure 9-34. Diagonal bright and dark lines on top of the roof 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
247 
6. 
From here on, you can add little details to finish your picture. Add birds, grass, or 
whatever you can think of (see Figure 9-35). 
 
Figure 9-35. The finished pixel image with details added 
Painting Without a Tablet 
Chapter 8 describes how you can use all aspects of your graphics tablet to paint whatever you 
imagine. You can also do this without a graphics tablet with the help of the Paths tool. It allows 
stroking lines and emulating paint dynamics, which are usually performed with your free hand. 
Assistive Painting: The Paths Tool 
The path tool allows you to create smooth curves and complex geometric objects. This makes it 
the perfect tool for drawing and creating selections for image manipulation.  
The advantages of using paths include the following: 
• 
You can create curvy lines, as well as straight lines, like the Pencil tool. 
• 
Selections can be transformed into paths and paths can be transformed into 
selections. This is needed to fill drawings with a color when created with a path. 
• 
Paths are saved with the GIMP Image Format (XCF) and can therefore be reused when 
reopening the image. This is a good way to save selections as well. 
The paths tool can be selected from the toolbox or by pressing the B key. It has many 
different modes, which makes it a tool for the moderately advanced user. Every line segment uses 
handles to bend the line segment in every direction. These lines are called paths or vectors. 
Anatomy of a Path 
A path line can also be referred to as a path segment because it is not a simple straight line 
connected by two points. The path uses handles and anchors to create a curve out of a path. 
Think of it as attaching weights to a wooden plank to make it bend (see Figure 9-36). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
248 
Handles
Handles
Anchors
 
Figure 9-36. An anatomy of a path. The handles on the anchors are used to bend the path by dragging the 
handles. 
Creating a Path Segment 
A simple path segment is created similar to a straight line. You create two points and GIMP 
connects the two points with a path. This exercise does not end by creating a path segment.  
The path tool’s primary use is to create curves and stroke them with a paint tool of your 
choice. Paths can be altered at any time before you stroke the path, which provides a lot of 
flexibility.  
1. 
Create a new image. 
2. 
Choose the path tool or simply press B. 
3. 
Create a first point with a single mouse-click somewhere in the image. 
4. 
Create another point somewhere else in the image to connect the anchor points and to 
create the line (see Figure 9-37). 
 
Figure 9-37. A path segment created with two anchor points 
Creating an S-Curve 
An S-Curve is a simple form of a curve, where the two handles of the anchor points face opposite 
directions. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
249 
1. 
Create a new image or use the path from the previous exercise. 
2. 
Bisect the line (use your imagination) and move your mouse pointer to the first half of 
the path. 
3. 
Drag the path slowly in one direction, which is illustrated in Figure 9-38. The closer 
your mouse pointer is to an anchor point, the greater the increase of the curve. 
 
Figure 9-38. Drag the line segment in the direction indicated by the arrow. 
4. 
Now do the same with the opposite half of the path segment. Move the segment 
towards the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 9-39. 
 
Figure 9-39. To create an S-shape, move the other half of the path in the opposite direction. 
5. 
You can now use the handles to shape the line further. Simply click the little squares at 
the end of the handle and drag them into different positions to see how the handle 
influences the curve and to get a feeling for the path tool. 
Creating an M-Shaped Curve 
An M-shaped curve involves a bit more bending of the curve. It uses at least three anchor points 
and two path segments. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
250 
1. 
Create a new image. 
2. 
Create two path segments by creating three anchor points (see Figure 9-40). 
 
Figure 9-40. A path with two segments 
3. 
Move the entire left path segment upwards, as illustrated in Figure 9-41, by holding 
your mouse button and moving the mouse forward. You decide which part of the path 
that you move upwards. Move the path segment in the middle upwards and you will 
create a nice, circular-shaped path. 
 
Figure 9-41. Move the entire path segment upwards.  
4. 
Move the second path segment upwards, as illustrated in Figure 9-42. 
 
Figure 9-42. The second path segment is moved upward to create an M-shaped path. 
Deleting Anchor Points and Path Segments 
When creating paths, it may be necessary to delete obsolete anchor points. 
Deleting path segments always involves deleting their connecting anchor points, as shown in 
Figures 9-43 and 9-44. With the anchor points deleted, the corresponding path segment will be 
removed. Path segments can be easily deleted by selecting an anchor point and by hitting Delete 
on your keyboard. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
251 
 
Figure 9-43. If you delete an anchor point on either edge of the path, the path segment connecting the anchor 
will be deleted. 
 
Figure 9-44. If you delete a path segment inside the path, the next anchor point will be used to reconnect the 
path. 
The Path Tool Options 
The tool options of the path tool provide three modes affecting path creation, movement, and 
deletion of anchor points. Each of the modes allows various choices to be made, which makes the 
tool quite complex. 
 
Figure 9-45. The path tool options showing the three edit modes 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
252 
The following are the three modes of the path tool: 
• 
Design: Adds new anchor points and path segments (the default mode) 
• 
Edit: Allows you to drag handles from anchor points and transform path segments; it 
also allows you to insert new anchor points in existing path segments 
• 
Move: Allows you to reposition the entire path 
Closing a Path 
So far, we’ve showed you how to create simple paths. What if you want to draw an object such as 
an ellipsis or a cube? What if you want to trace a portrait? The path you draw needs to be closed 
the same way a circle is closed: the end point and start point are merged. This exercise shows you 
how to created closed paths. 
1. 
Create a new image 
2. 
Create a new path, which needs to be closed (see Figure 9-46). 
 
Figure 9-46. A new path is created, which we would like to close. 
3. 
Open the tool options of the path tool by double-clicking on the path tool icon in the 
toolbox or by pressing B. 
4. 
Change the path tool to edit mode (see Figure 9-47). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
253 
 
Figure 9-47. The path tool options need to be in edit mode to connect the start and endpoint. 
5. 
To close the path click the first anchor point that you created (see Figure 9-48).

254 
 
Figure 9-48. The closed path 
Stroking a Path with a Paint Tool 
So far, the path is not more than a reference line, which is invisible when you save your picture. 
Once the path has been created, it is time to stroke it with the paint tool of your choice. By 
clicking the “Stroke Path” button, which can be found in the path tool options, a Stroke Path 
dialog appears (see Figure 9-49). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
255 
 
Figure 9-49. The Stroke Path dialog lets you render the paths you created. The options allow you to use any 
paint tool or a simple line. 
This dialog allows you to choose how your path becomes visible; or, in other words, painted 
on the canvas. 
1. 
Create a new image. 
2. 
Open the tool options of the path tool by double-clicking on the path tool icon in the 
toolbox. 
3. 
Create a new path and click the Stroke Path button in the path tool options dialog or 
select Edit ➤ Stroke Path (see Figure 9-50). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
256 
 
Figure 9-50. Drawing the created path with the Stroke Path dialog is easy because it strokes the 
paths you created with a normal line style. 
4. 
Choose the paint tool you’d like to stroke the path with and click Stroke (see Figure  
9-51). 
 
Figure 9-51. After the path has been stroked, the resulting image will look like this illustration. 
Common Problems with Using Paths 
Using paths is a very advanced technique. Table 9-1 lists common pitfalls and how to manage 
them. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
257 
Table 9-1. Symptoms and solutions 
Symptom 
Solution 
When I move one 
anchor point, the whole 
path moves. 
This can happen after you bend the path. Two anchor points or more 
are selected. You deselect one anchor point by holding the Shift key. 
I can’t seem to add any 
anchor points anymore. 
Check if the “mode” option in the path tool options is set to Design. 
I always create 
additional anchor points 
by accident. 
Simply delete them by changing the “mode” option in the path tool 
options to Edit. Hold the Shift key and click the anchor point you 
want to delete. 
I can’t bend paths 
anymore. 
Check if the Polygonal option is set in the path tool options and 
uncheck it if it is. 
The Paths Dialog 
The Paths dialog can be opened by selecting Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Paths (see Figure  
9-52). It provides a way to manage all paths that have been created for the currently opened 
image. New entries in the dialog are created if you create new paths in your image. 
The dialog can also be used to export and import paths to exchange information with vector 
drawing applications like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator in a vector file format called SVG.

Turning a Selection into a Path 
We’ve already shown you in previous sections how to create a selection. Sometimes it can be 
helpful to save a selection for later use. 
1. 
Create a new image in GIMP. 
2. 
Create a selection with a selection tool (see Figure 9-53). (If you are unsure follow 
section “Create an Ellipsis.”)  
 
Figure 9-53. An elliptic selection to convert to a path. The right panel shows in the top-left corner 
of the paths dialog. 
3. 
Click Select ➤ To Path to create a path from the selection (see Figure 9-54). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
259 
 
Figure 9-54. The selection still exists, but the paths dialog now shows a new entry (illustrated by 
the long arrow). 
4. 
De-select the selection by clicking Select ➤ None. 
5. 
Open the path dialog (Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Paths). You should now see a 
new entry in the dialog (see Figure 9-54). 
6. 
To stroke this path, focus on the path dialog. Choose the button “Paint along the path” 
(second button from right), which will bring up the Stroke Path dialog (see Figure  
9-55).

Turning a Path into a Selection 
If you like to reuse saved selections from before or like to extract elements from a photo, create 
the path and transform it into a selection. 
1. 
Create a new image in GIMP. 
2. 
Create a new path. You don’t have to close the path, which is described in the “Closing 
a Path” section. If you don’t close the path, GIMP creates the selection from the first 
anchor point to the end point (see Figure 9-56). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
261 
 
Figure 9-56. Create the path around the object; here it starts at the bottom of the t-shirt. 
3. 
Click Select ➤ From Path to create a selection from the path (see Figure 9-57). 
 
Figure 9-57. Once the path is finished, the selection is easily created. 
4. 
Optional: You can now extract part of the image by using Edit ➤ Cut and paste it as a 
new layer by using Edit ➤ Paste as ➤ New Layer (see Figure 9-58). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
262 
 
Figure 9-58. The extracted and pasted image as a new layer (the selection was not very precise on the edges 
of the image) 
Extracting Elements from an Image with a Path 
The Path tool can become very useful to extract elements from photos. You create a path, 
transform it into a selection, and copy the image element you want to extract. This method shows 
a different way of extracting elements. GIMP also provides the Foreground Selection Tool, which 
can be found in Tools ➤ Selection Tools ➤ Foreground Select. 
1. 
Open the image that holds the element you’d like to extract. For this exercise, we will 
reuse the example image we’ve used in the previous example and refine the selection. 
2. 
Create a new path around the object you’d like to select. Focus on creating a rough 
outline (see Figure 9-59).

Figure 9-59. Create a rough outline with the path. 
3. 
Set the zoom to the maximum, or depending how many anchor points you have set, a 
zoom level you can comfortably work with. Now customize the path by bending the 
segments to shape a form around the object you want to extract. Click and hold the 
mouse button while dragging the segments. Figure 9-60 illustrates this by using 
arrows. 
 
Figure 9-60. Move the paths in the direction you want to bend them.

4. 
For paths segments that form a corner, you can smooth them by holding the Shift key 
while clicking and dragging the handles in either direction (see Figure 9-61). 
■ Tip To navigate better in high zoom levels, hold the spacebar while moving your mouse pointer around. 
 
Figure 9-61. Smoothen cornered paths by holding the Shift key while dragging the handles to 
either side. 
5. 
Continue smoothing every part of a path until you are satisfied. If you added another 
anchor point by mistake, remove the point by changing the path mode to Edit in the 
paths tool options, hold the Shift key while you click on the point. Make sure you 
switch back to Design.

Figure 9-62. The path after it has been “smoothened” manually  
6. 
Create a selection by clicking Select ➤ From Path (see Figure 9-62). 
7. 
Extract the element by copying it to the clipboard with Edit ➤ Copy or CTRL + C. 
8. 
You can now use your extracted element in a new image by selecting File ➤ Create ➤ 
From Clipboard (see Figure 9-63). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
266 
 
Figure 9-63. The extracted image now looks much better. With paths you have full control and you can 
readjust and refine the paths to make the extractions even better. 
Creating Text That Flows Along a Path 
Chapter 6 introduced the text tool to create a web banner. Text usually flows naturally from one 
direction to the other. But if you are creating invitations or cards to celebrate your child’s 
birthday, for example, you will need something more out of the line: text that follows a curve, for 
example. With the path tool, you can create the foundation for the text direction; the path tool 
provides the text itself. Using them together, you can create interesting word art. 
1. 
Create a new image in GIMP. 
2. 
Create a new path with two segments. Don’t bend the path for now; concentrate on 
the basic shape (see Figure 9-64). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
267 
 
Figure 9-64. Create a very basic shape. 
3. 
Bend the path to the shape. Simply drag the path upwards with the mouse to a 
semicircle shape. The text will later flow over and under the path (see Figure 9-65). 
 
Figure 9-65. After bending the path segment it may not look symmetrical. Fix that by simply 
pushing one of the helping lines up- or downwards. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
268 
4. 
Create a new text layer (as it was introduced in Chapter 6). Mind you, the text should 
be as long as the path. This is hard to predict, so you will need to cater for a little trial-
and-error time (see Figure 9-66). 
 
Figure 9-66. After creating the initial text, make it larger (if you need) by selecting the text and 
changing the text size. 
5. 
Once the text is created, select Layer ➤ Text along Path. GIMP creates a new path with 
the text information along the old path. To avoid any confusion, disable the visibility of 
the text layer by clicking the eye icon next to the layer entry (see Figure 9-67). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
269 
 
Figure 9-67. GIMP rendered the text along the path and the visibility of the text layer is switched 
off. 
6. 
Check your path dialog and you will see a new path entry. The text rendered along the 
path is itself a path. This is important, as you still need to render the new text to the 
layer, otherwise nothing will show up in the printout. 
7. 
If your path is not rendered correctly, you may need to remove the path in the path 
dialog, change the text and re-render it along the path again. If it is rendered out of  
the image (in the gray area), you may need to move the path into the image (see Figure 
9-68). To do that, select the move tool and open the move tool options. By default you 
will move the layer, but you will want to move the text rendered along the path. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
270 
 
Figure 9-68. The text is rendered over the edges of the image. 
8. 
Check the layer dialog. Select the background layer to stroke the text rendered along 
the path. 
 
Figure 9-69. The path moved to the middle of the image with the move tool 

CHAPTER 9 ■ DIGITAL ART: DRAWING IN GIMP 
271 
9. 
Now it is up to you: you can stroke the path with the paint tool and color of your choice 
as introduced in the “Stroking a Path with a Paint Tool” section (see Figure 9-70). You 
can also fill the path by creating a selection introduced in the “Creating a Selection 
from a Path” section (see Figure 9-71). 
 
Figure 9-70. The path stroked with the Stroke Path dialog and a line width of three pixels 
 
Figure 9-71. A selection was created out of the path and filled with a black foreground color.  
Summary 
This chapter used the toolbox and toolbox options to show you how to draw perfectly straight 
lines, circles, ellipses and squares. Also how to be creative and change these shapes and how to 
fill areas with color. You are introduced to the world of drawing tiny pictures in our pixel art 
section. There is a digital freehand section using the Paths Tool. Finally we show you how to 
create curving text.

Hints, Tips, and Further Help 
This chapter looks at some of the ways you can customize GIMP. We also show you where to find 
and add extra options such as plug-ins and extensions. We look at the similarities and differences 
between GIMP and Photoshop. There is a Troubleshooting section and information on where to 
go for further help. 
Customizing GIMP 
The Preferences dialog allows you to customize GIMP. You can ignore this area altogether or you 
can customize GIMP so that each time it opens, certain areas are arranged the way that you 
prefer. The Preferences dialog is available at Edit ➤ Preferences (see Figure 10-1). 
There is a large range of options to customize. Here are are some that you might find useful: 
• 
To change the size of a new blank image, go to Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Default Image 
(see Figure 10-1). 
• 
To change the spacing of the grid placed over an image when aligning items, go to 
Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Default Grid.  
• 
To change or turn off some of the items seen when you open your workspace, go to 
Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Image Windows ➤ Appearance. 
Most changes made in the Preferences dialog will not take effect until you restart GIMP. If 
you do not like the changes that you made in the Preferences area, you can always return to the 
default values by going back to the settings area and clicking Reset.

Increasing GIMP’s Undo History  
When GIMP is first loaded, there are only five undo steps. For example, if you make six brush 
strokes, you can only go back five steps in the Undo History. It is possible, however, to increase 
the number of steps in Undo History, as follows:  
1. 
Go to Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Environment (see Figure 10-1).  
2. 
Under “Resource Consumption” go to “Minimal number of undo levels.” Change this 
number to 20 or more.  
3. 
Also, increase the “Maximum undo memory” to 200 or more.  
4. 
Restart GIMP to make these changes take effect. 
You can change these values at any time. To undo changes, hit the Reset button at the bottom of 
the Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Environment page.

Scanning Images 
Importing images from a scanner or camera is different on every operating system. For scanning, 
the application GIMP uses is based on your computer’s operating system, as shown in Table 10-1.

GIMP Can Be Extended 
It is possible to extend GIMP’s functionality with Plug-ins and Extensions. 
What is a Plug-in? 
Plug-ins are extra brushes, patterns, color tables, 3D effects, filters, and more. GIMP has a large 
range of downloadable plug-ins. These extensions increase the functionality of GIMP. There are 
two types of plug-ins: 
• 
Plug-ins that use the Python programming language and end with “.py” can be used 
on any operating system. 
• 
Plug-ins with an “.exe” file extension are for Microsoft Windows only. 
The central repository for downloading plug-ins is at http://registry.GIMP.org. 
■ Note Plug-ins are not part of the core of GIMP. Some plug-ins are thoroughly tested and some are not. 
Check how popular a plug-in is and how old it is before you install it. You could try researching the plug-in 
name on Google for comments or reviews. 
Installing Plug-ins 
All new extensions or plug-ins go into one of the sub-folders in your GIMP user folder. The 
location of this folder depends on your version of GIMP and your operating system. The user 
folder keeps all your data, including patterns, saved tool settings, palettes, and plug-ins.  
Windows 
To install a Windows plug-in, do the following: 
1. 
Download the plug-in. 
2. 
Click the Windows Start symbol and click on your username. 
3. 
In your username folder, open the GIMP folder (see Figure 10-3). 
4. 
Copy the plug-in into the plug-in folder. 
5. 
Restart GIMP.

Photoshop and GIMP: A Comparison 
If you are a Photoshop user, please do not open GIMP and expect it to look and feel like 
Photoshop. GIMP does not try to mimic Photoshop’s layout or behavior. If you have worked with 
Photoshop for some time you will find using GIMP more difficult to use than someone who has 
never used Photoshop. When you open GIMP for the first time, work on a simple task first and 
then slowly build on it.

GIMP and Photoshop on the Same Computer 
In Windows it is possible to run GIMP and Photoshop on the same computer. You may get an 
error message when you add GIMP saying it needs a file, Plug-ins.dll. This occurs because 
Photoshop is using this file. Navigate to your Photoshop folder and copy the Plug-ins.dll file. 
Then, put the file into the System 32 folder of your Windows installation. Ask a friend to help if 
you are not sure where this is. 
Troubleshooting GIMP 
GIMP is a lot of fun, but occasionally new users can get confused. Here are some tips. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ HINTS, TIPS, AND FURTHER HELP 
281 
I Just Want One Workspace 
You need to be in single-window mode. This option has been available since GIMP 2.8. In the top 
menu area, go to Windows ➤ Single Window Mode. The three windows are joined into one 
workspace. For further details, see Chapter 2. 
I Cannot Seem to Paint or Fill My Image with a Color 
This is most likely due to a wrong active layer or a small selection. To resolve, try following these 
pointers: 
• 
From the Selection menu, deselect everything by going Select ➤ None. If you created 
a very tiny selection by accident, your paint tools will only fill this small selection. By 
deselecting everything, you can start over by painting or filling. 
• 
A wrong layer is selected. Select the background layer in your layer dialog. The layer 
dialog is made visible by selecting Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Layers. 
• 
Check that the image is not set to indexed mode by selecting Image ➤ Mode ➤ 
Indexed. If it is selected, then you can only paint with a small range of colors. This is 
caused by loading indexed images in the .gif format. 
The Paint Tools Are Not Working  
Check your layer dialog. Do you have an active floating selection in there (see Figure 10-4)? 
 
Figure 10-4. A floating selection can cause paint tools not to paint anymore. 
The floating selection becomes the active selection after you paste a copied image element. 
This takes precedence over all functionality because you may apply a filter or paint tool to the 
wrong layer. 
Solve this by anchoring the selection, go to Layer ➤ Anchor Layer. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ HINTS, TIPS, AND FURTHER HELP 
282 
GIMP Will Not Let Me Do Anything 
You may be working in GIMP and suddenly find you are prevented from doing anything. The 
most likely reason is that you have a dialog box or small window hiding underneath GIMP or 
underneath something else open on your desktop. Find the open dialog box and Click OK or 
cancel the dialog to continue working. 
The other possibility is that you are editing large image files and are using too much RAM. 
Increasing GIMP’s speed is covered later in this chapter. 
Lost Toolbox or Other Dialogs 
You lost your toolbox and all that you can see is an image window. To bring back your toolbox, do 
the following: 
• 
Press CTRL+B for Windows or COMMAND+B for Mac or 
• 
Click on Windows ➤ New Toolbox 
If you cannot see important dialogs like layers and tool options, restore them by: 
• 
Selecting Windows ➤ Recently Closed Docks, or 
• 
Going to the sub-menu items under Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs  
Where Is Undo History? 
If you have lost your Undo History in single-window mode, go to View ➤ Shrink Wrap. You 
should now see your Undo History on the right of your screen. 
Resizing Your Workspace 
To resize the GIMP workspace to the image size, use the View ➤ Shrink Wrap menu option. 
Layer Control 
If you are working with many layers, selecting layers can be a nuisance with the default setting of 
the move tool. Go to Edit ➤ Preferences and choose the Tool Options entry. Check the item 
labeled with “Set layer or path as active” under the Move tool option. Whenever you select an 
item in your image, it selects the corresponding layer. 
How Do I Make Changes Outside a Selected Area? 
Sometimes you need to select part of an image to isolate it from the changes you wish to make in 
adjacent areas. To make changes outside a selected area, go to Select ➤ Invert; the area outside 
your selection is activated. Any changes made will not affect the selected area. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ HINTS, TIPS, AND FURTHER HELP 
283 
How Do I Reset a Tool or Dialog? 
GIMP allows you to reset every changed value back to the default. Every dialog has a Reset button 
next to the OK button. Click on the Reset button if you want to revert the current dialog values to 
default. 
Improving GIMP’s Speed 
If you are waiting a long time for something to render in GIMP, it might be because you do not 
have enough memory (RAM) allocated. The best way to improve GIMP’s speed is to allocate more 
memory to GIMP.  
To change the amount of RAM, do the following: 
1. 
Go to Edit ➤ Preferences. (Refer to Figure 10-1). 
2. 
Click Environment. Under “Resource Consumption” set the Tile cache size to about 
half the memory on your computer. If you don’t know how to find how much RAM you 
have on your computer, ask a friend to help you.  
How Do I Get Maximum Editing Control of an Image? 
Most images in GIMP use three channels by default: red, green, and blue. Exceptions are 
grayscale images or indexed images, which use a small number of colors. Therefore, just about 
every color photo you load into GIMP has three channels. You can see, select, and manage the 
channels in the channel dialog found under Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ Channels (see 
Figure 10-5). 
 
Figure 10-5. The Channels dialog 
How do I Copy and Paste in GIMP 
In Windows click Control C to copy and Control V to paste a selection. For Mac click Command C 
to copy and Command V to paste a selection. This new selection becomes a floating layer. You 
need to anchor the selection by going to Layer ➤ Anchor Layer. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ HINTS, TIPS, AND FURTHER HELP 
284 
How do I remove the Marching Ant Border around my Image 
Go to View ➤ Show Layer Boundary to remove the border. 
How do I open Raw Files 
The up-to-date version of GIMP cannot open raw images on its own. If you want to edit raw 
images, you will need to install a plug-in called UFRaw. UFRaw converts your raw files so that 
they can be imported into GIMP. UFRaw is third-party software; however, some builds of GIMP 
for Mac are shipped with UFRaw preinstalled.  
Further Help 
Assistance is available from the Help menu in GIMP. However, if you click Help in GIMP, you 
may see the following message: “The GIMP user manual is not installed on your computer.” Click 
the Read Online button or install the help package that is available for your operating system. 
Windows users should go to www.gimp.org/windows. Click the Installer. Under GIMP Help 2 there 
is a selection of Help documents available in more than a dozen languages. Select a language, 
then follow the prompts to install Help. 
Additional help is available at www.gimp.org/links. This web page contains lists of tutorials, 
clubs, and communities. The large community of GIMP users and enthusiasts organize in 
forums, chat environments, and mailing lists.  
Mailing Lists 
GIMP has a number of mailing lists. There is a mailing list for people who use GIMP, as well as 
lists for the developers. An overview of all GIMP mailing lists are at 
www.GIMP.org/mail_lists.html. 
IRC: Joining the GIMP Community 
IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. People on IRC do not actually talk—they type messages. These 
messages are seen by anyone logged in to a particular session. (People using IRC must be 
respectful or they may be removed.) IRC is one of the ways GIMP is developed. There is a GIMP 
channel for developers and another one for users. For further information go to 
www.gimp.org/irc.html.

Other Open-Source Graphics Software 
GIMP is not the only free, open-source software program available for digital graphics. 
Depending on the task you want to solve, you might find another program more useful. 
Inkscape 
Inkscape’s focus is on paths, not pixels (see Figure 10-6). Inkscape is a vector graphics editor that 
has similarities to CorelDRAW and Adobe Illustrator. You can export/import Inkscape 
illustrations into GIMP. Inkscape is often used to create illustrations or web site layouts. Inkscape 
is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems at http://inkscape.org.

Scribus 
Scribus is a desktop publishing program. It is suitable to create flyers, newspapers, and books. It 
uses advanced color-management systems and versatile PDF creation. Scribus has press-ready 
output and a fresh approach to page design. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux 
operating systems at www.scribus.net.

GNU General Public License 
 
Version 3, 29 June 2007 
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <http://fsf.org/> 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but 
changing it is not allowed.  
Preamble  
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it 
remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General 
Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its 
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.  
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public 
Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want 
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know 
you can do these things.  
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you 
to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must 
pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.  
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on 
the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or 
modify it.  
For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no 
warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified 
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to 
authors of previous versions.  

APPENDIX B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
296 
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the 
software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible 
with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such 
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most 
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for 
those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend 
this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of 
users.  
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow 
patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those 
that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it 
effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the 
program non-free.  
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  
Terms and Conditions 
0.  Definitions  
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as 
semiconductor masks.  
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is 
addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.  
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring 
copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a 
“modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.  
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make 
you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except 
executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, 
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries 
other activities as well.  
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or 
receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a 
copy, is not conveying.  
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it 
includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright 
notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that 
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view 
a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a 
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  
1.  Source Code 
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to 
it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.  

CHAPTER B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
297 
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a 
recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming 
language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.  
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a 
whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not 
part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major 
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to 
the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential 
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which 
the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter 
used to run it.  
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code 
needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the 
work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System 
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used 
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, 
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, 
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is 
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between 
those subprograms and other parts of the work.  
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.  
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.  
2.  Basic Permissions 
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and 
are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your 
unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work 
is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This 
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions 
so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for 
the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in 
conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the 
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, 
on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their 
relationship with you.  
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated 
below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  
3.  Protecting Users’ Legal Rights from Anti-Circumvention 
Law 
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any 
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 
December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  

APPENDIX B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
298 
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under 
this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation 
or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third 
parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.  
4.  Conveying Verbatim Copies 
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms 
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any 
warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer 
support or warranty protection for a fee.  
5.  Conveying Modified Source Versions  
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the 
Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all 
of these conditions:   
a) 
The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, 
and giving a relevant date.  
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under 
this License and any conditions added under section 7. This 
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all 
notices”.  
c) 
You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to 
anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will 
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to 
the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are 
packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any 
other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have 
separately received it.  
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work 
need not make them do so.  
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not 
by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to 
form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal 
rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered 
work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  

CHAPTER B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
299 
6.  Conveying Non-Source Forms  
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, 
provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of 
this License, in one of these ways:   
a) 
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the 
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily 
used for software interchange.  
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written 
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare 
parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who 
possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source 
for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a 
durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, 
for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing 
this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding 
Source from a network server at no charge.  
c) 
Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written 
offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed 
only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the 
object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place 
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the 
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no 
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the 
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy 
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be 
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports 
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions 
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. 
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain 
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy 
these requirements.  
e) 
Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you 
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of 
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under 
subsection 6d.  
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object  
code work.  
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal 
property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything 
designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a 
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product 
received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of 
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user 
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product 

APPENDIX B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
300 
regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.  
“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization 
keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in 
that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must 
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case 
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.  
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a 
User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession 
and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term 
(regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under 
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not 
apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the 
User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).  
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to 
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or 
installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. 
Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects 
the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the 
network.  
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this 
section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available 
to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, 
reading or copying.  
7.  Additional Terms  
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making 
exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though 
they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If 
additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under 
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to 
the additional permissions.  
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional 
permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to 
require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work. )You may place additional 
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give 
appropriate copyright permission.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, 
you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this 
License with terms:   
a) 
Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of 
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or   
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author 
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices 
displayed by works containing it; or   
c) 
Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in 
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or   

CHAPTER B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
301 
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors 
of the material; or   
e) 
Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade 
names, trademarks, or service marks; or   
f)  
Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by 
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with 
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability 
that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors 
and authors.  
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the 
meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating 
that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove 
that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or 
conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of 
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or 
conveying.  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant 
source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating 
where to find the applicable terms.  
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately 
written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  
8.  Termination  
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph 
of section 11).  
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular 
copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly 
and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you 
of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the 
copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you 
have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and 
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who 
have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated 
and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material 
under section 10.  
9.  Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies 
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. 
Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer 
transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other 
than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions 
infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a 
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  

APPENDIX B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
302 
10.  Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients  
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or 
substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If 
propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction 
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s 
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession 
of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has 
it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed 
under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for 
exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, 
using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  
11.  Patents 
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a 
work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s 
“contributor version”.  
A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the 
contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some 
manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not 
include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the 
contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent 
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.  
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise 
run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or 
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to 
practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent 
license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent 
against the party.  
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding 
Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this 
License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you 
must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive 
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream 
recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, 
your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a 
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to 
believe are valid.  
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or 
propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the 
parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a 
specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to 
all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.  

CHAPTER B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
303 
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, 
prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that 
are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party 
to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which 
you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, 
and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work 
from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work 
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that 
arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license  
or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable  
patent law.  
12.  No Surrender of Others’ Freedom 
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further 
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both 
those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  
13.  Use with the GNU Affero General Public License 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any 
covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into 
a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue 
to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero 
General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the 
combination as such.  
14.  Revised Versions of this License  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General 
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain 
numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you 
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a 
version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published 
by the Free Software Foundation.  
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General 
Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently 
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.  
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no 
additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing 
to follow a later version.  

APPENDIX B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
304 
15.  Disclaimer of Warranty  
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. 
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
16.  Limitation of Liability  
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR 
DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES 
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF 
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.  
17.  Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16  
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal 
effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely 
approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a 
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.  
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the 
best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change 
under these terms.  
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of 
each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at 
least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
<one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does. > 
Copyright (C) <year><name of author> 
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of 
the License, or (at your option) any later version.  
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.  
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. 
If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  

CHAPTER B ■ GNU PUBLIC GENERAL LICENSE 
305 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts 
in an interactive mode:  <program>Copyright (C) <year><name of author> 
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w’.  
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 
`show c’ for details.  
The hypothetical commands `show w’ and `show c’ should show the appropriate parts of the 
General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI 
interface, you would use an “about box”.  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a 
“copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary.  
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see 
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to 
permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the 
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read 
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Glossary  
Alpha 
A pixel has red, green, and blue values; a pixel also has an alpha value. The alpha value refers to 
the transparency value of the pixel. A 0 value means the pixel is transparent; at the other end of 
the scale, at 255, a pixel is fully opaque. 
Not all file formats support transparency. PNG, PSD, TIF, and XCF all support transparency. 
Alpha Channel 
An alpha channel is used to represent the alpha value in an image. 
Aspect Ratio 
The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio between the width and height of an image. The first 
number refers to the width. 
Brightness 
Brightness refers to the amount of light in a color. If a red look unnaturally dark—it may need 
more brightness. If an aspect of the image lacks definition—it may have too much brightness. 
(See also Value. GIMP uses the term Value to denote the brightness or darkness of a color.) 
Color Cast 
A color cast is the term for a photo with an unnatural tinge or color across the entire photo. This 
happens when a photo is scanned, or with an old photo that has had its color quality degrade 
over time. Alternatively, the white balance in a digital camera may have been on the wrong 
setting. A safe setting for beginners is to set the white balance to automatic. Color Casts are 
repaired in GIMP using the Colors ➤ Levels option. 

GLOSSARY ■ 
308 
Convert to RGB Working Space 
This message appears when you are opening an image with a color profile, such as Adobe RGB, 
attached. “Yes” will convert your image to RGB. This is the standard used by the internet, 
computer printers, and most printing shops. 
Crop 
To crop an image means to remove some of the edges of the original image. Cropping can be very 
useful to improve the artistic qualities of an image, particularly when you crop out something 
distracting. 
Curves 
Curves is a GIMP tool that works on the brightness, contrast, and midtones in an image. Like the 
Levels tool, you can work on the entire image or work on the red, blue, and green color channels 
separately. The curves tool offers more control than most other GIMP color options. 
Dialog 
A dialog is a small panel or window that contains options and settings for tool or menu items. 
Dock 
A dock is a dialog window, which can collect all dockable dialogs under Windows ➤ Dockable 
Dialogs. 
Docking 
Docking is moving individual docks around. You can detach a dock by dragging it. It can then 
stand alone or it can be docked elsewhere in the workspace. 
Dot for Dot 
With Dot for Dot activated, every pixel in the image is displayed as one pixel on the screen. This 
mode is useful for web images. However, if you are working on images to be printed, disable Dot 
for Dot. To disable Dot for Dot, go to View ➤ Dot for Dot and uncheck Dot for Dot. (Note that this 
only unchecks Dot for Dot for the current image. To deactivate Dot for Dot permanently, go to 
Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Image Window and uncheck “Dot for Dot” by default and click OK.) 

GLOSSARY ■ 
309 
EXIF Data 
Most digital cameras provide extra data about an image. This information is usually about the 
camera model and camera settings such as shutter setting, image date, image size, and file size. 
To view this image data in GIMP, go to File ➤ Properties ➤ Advanced Tab. 
Export/Save Images 
Apart from GIMP’s native file format, XCF is saved using File ➤ Save; all other file formats use File 
➤ Export. 
GIMP 
The acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. Originally called The GIMP, the digital 
image editing program’s official name is now GIMP. 
Guides 
Single lines dragged from the ruler in GIMP’s workspace. They can be helpful for positioning text 
and web site layouts. 
Grid 
Grids are useful to line up elements in an image. To access the grid, go to View ➤ Show Grid in the 
top menu. Also see Snap to Grid. 
Help 
Windows users can get assistance by selecting Help ➤ Online Help in the top menu. Help can also 
be accessible by pressing F1 on your keyboard. 
HDR 
HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. Three or more bracketed exposures of an image are 
sandwiched together to increase the dynamic range. GIMP supports this option via a plug-in 
called Exposure Blend. 

GLOSSARY ■ 
310 
Histogram 
The Histogram gives a visual representation of the tonal and color information for the image. The 
default value setting displays the tonal and color information for the entire image. It is possible to 
change the value to red, blue, green, or alpha to view individual channel information for the 
image. 
Hue 
Hue is the aspect of the color that is yellow or red. If the skin tones or clouds in an image do not 
look natural, it is most likely because the hue is incorrect. If the photo looks very realistic, it is 
most likely because the image has the correct hue. Saturation, hue, and brightness make up the 
colors in an image. 
Inkscape 
Inkscape is an open-source editor for vector images. 
Interactive Boundary 
With the option enabled in some Selection Tools, the mouse can be used to adjust the edges of 
the completed selection. 
Levels 
Levels is a dialog available at Colors ➤ Levels. Beginners can select the Auto button for additional 
even tones in their image. 
LZW 
LZW (Lempie-Zif-Welch) is a lossless compression format. The compression process does not 
delete data. LZW is available in GIMP when exporting (saving) TIF files. 
Pixel 
A pixel is the smallest element in a digital image. GIMP edits pixels. 

GLOSSARY ■ 
311 
Pixel Art 
Each pixel in a painting is individually painted. This gives a lot of clarity to an image. Early 
computer games used pixel art. This retro form of computer art still has a following because 
mobile phones and other digital devices have low resolution displays. Pixel art has a small file size 
and usually is saved as a PNG or GIF image. Favicons are often made from pixel art. 
Plug-in 
Plug-ins are extensions to GIMP’s functionality. A plug-in is an external program that runs inside 
GIMP and interacts with GIMP. Some plug-ins have been thoroughly tested, while others have 
not. Plug-ins are located at http://registry.gimp.org. 
Raster Images 
GIMP edits raster images. A raster image uses a bitmap data structure to capture images. 
Saturation 
Saturation refers to the strength of color in an image. If the image looks washed out, then it is 
lacking saturation. If the image has too much color, it is oversaturated. Hue, saturation, and value 
(HSV) are the three aspects making up color in an image. GIMP uses RGB color by default and 
HSV directly relates to RGB color manipulations. 
Save 
XCF is the only file format saved from the Save menu within GIMP. All other file formats use the 
Export menu to save images. 
Scaling 
An image can be made smaller by scaling-down or larger by scaling-up an image. Also known as 
resizing. 
Scale-Up 
To scale-up an image means that an image’s dimensions are made larger. This may mean a loss 
of image quality.  

GLOSSARY ■ 
312 
Sharpening 
Unlike film photographs, a sharpening tool can improve most digital photographs. The digitizing 
process produces slightly out-of-focus images. The most useful tool in GIMP for sharpening 
photos is the Unsharp Mask found in Filters ➤ Enhance ➤ Unsharp Mask. There is also a tool 
called Sharpen. Sharpen highlights the edges in photos, but also the noise. Unsharp Mask gives a 
more natural result. 
Snap to Grid 
With this setting enabled, any object moved within eight pixels distance of the grid will snap to 
the grid. To activate Snap to Grid, go to View ➤ Snap to Grid in the top menu. To change the 
snapping distance, go to Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Tool Options and change the “Snap distance.” The 
snap distance is measured in pixels. 
Snap to Guide 
With this setting enabled, any object moved within eight pixels distance of the guide will snap to 
the guide. To activate Snap to Guide, go to View ➤ Snap to Guide in the top menu. To change the 
snapping distance, go to Edit ➤ Preferences ➤ Tool Options and change the “Snap distance.” The 
snap distance is measured in pixels. 
Tonal Range 
The tonal range of an image refers to the brightest part through to the darkest part of an image. 
GIMP’s Curves and Levels tools display the tonal range of an image in graph form. 
Undo 
To undo the last step, press Control+Z or go to Edit ➤ Undo in the menu. See also Undo History. 
Undo History 
GIMP does a limited number undo steps by default. To increase this number, go to Edit ➤ 
Preferences ➤ Environment. 
Unsharp Mask 
Use this tool for sharpening your images (rather than the less sophisticated Sharpen option). 
Unsharp Mask is found at Filters ➤ Enhance ➤ Unsharp Mask. 

GLOSSARY ■ 
313 
Value 
Value simply refers to the brightness or darkness of a color. Hue, saturation, and value (HSV) 
work together to form color images. GIMP’s digital editing uses RGB color by default. 
Vector Images 
Vector images use geometrical points, lines, and curves to represent an image. 
XCF 
XCF is GIMP’s native file format. XCF stores all the raw data of an image file. If you intend to do 
extensive work on an image, save the image as an XCF file. XCF is only readable in GIMP. When 
you have finished working on an image, export the XCF file as a TIF, JPG, or other file format. XCF 
files contain information about layers, the pixel data for each layer, and the current selection; it 
records channels if there are any, as well as paths and guides. You can save your XCF image 
repeatedly with no loss of quality. In contrast, each time you save a JPG, some of the data is lost or 
modified.  
One thing to note, XCF files do not record the Undo History. 
Zoom 
There are many ways to zoom in GIMP, as follows:  
• 
Zoom using the following keyboard numbers:  
• 
1 = 100%  
• 
2 = 200% 
• 
3 = 400% 
• 
4 = 800% 
• 
5 = 1600% 
• 
Zoom via the menu options: View ➤ Zoom 
• 
Zoom via the pull-down menu at the bottom edge of the workspace window 
• 
Zoom using the Magnifying Tool in the Toolbox 
• 
Keyboard shortcuts for zooming:  
• 
Fit image in window: Shift+Ctrl+E 
• 
Zoom In: + 
• 
Zoom Out: -
