Bohr’s Atomic Model
Arne Schirrmacher
The model of Niels Bohr (1885–1962) for the atom is since long just the one and
only conception for atoms of the vast majority of educated people. The picture of
 electrons revolving round a nucleus on select avenues has become the icon of the
atomic age. In stark contrast to this omnipresence, historically, the Bohr atom may
be identiﬁed as the best available theory for the atom only for a period of roughly
ten years between 1914 and 1924. For this reason any consideration of Bohr’s atom
has to take into account both the historical context of its creation and the long and
diverse processes of reception within science, education and public that gave rise
to much misinterpretation of Bohr’s intentions, his actual work and its physical or
realistic interpretation.
For the question of the genesis of the Bohr model one has to go back to the be-
ginning of the twentieth century, when it became widely recognized that both atoms
contain electrons and at the same time were almost fully penetrable by electron
bombardment. Between 1901 and 1905 various physicists and science popularizers
draw the analogy between atoms and planetary systems (e.g. Jean Perrin (1870–
1942), Wilhelm Meyer (1853–1910), or Hantaro Nagaoka (1856–1950)  atomic
models) and some of them immediately realized the difference: Since electric forces

were both attractive and repulsive it was hard to understand how stable conﬁgura-
tions could result at all. As a consequence in the years before world war I concern
with detailed atomic models was not widespread. For this reason also the  Ruther-
ford atom was largely ignored until it could be reinterpreted as a predecessor of
the Bohr atom. The favorite heuristic models for the atom in the years around 1910
also for Bohr was Thomson’s that came in various imprecise and at times conﬂict-
ing variations but was nonetheless able to serve in this way the purpose in helping
to conceptualize stability, light emission and the existence of a periodic system of
elements.
When Bohr in 1911/1912 went to Cambridge and Manchester to work with
Thomson (1856–1940)and Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937),resp., he was mostly in-
terested in extending his doctoral thesis on the electron theory of metals (for which
Thomson had been a pioneer). The problem of bound electrons made Bohr looking
for special assumptions about their arrangements and motions that could be treated
in a Thomsonian manner. The switch to Rutherford then was neither motivated by a
discontent with Thomson nor by a particular interest in the Rutherford atom, but by
Rutherford’s work in radioactivity. Rather by accident in commenting on a theory
of α-particle absorption in metals by the Rutherford collaborator Charles G. Darwin
(1887–1963) Bohr arrived at discussing atomic structure for the ﬁrst time, as in this
work the problems of bound electrons in metals and atomic structure met. At this
stage Bohr conceived of an atomic model that “would not be an indication of the na-
ture of a possibility (like J. J. Thomson’s theory) but perhaps a little piece of reality”
(letter to Harald Bohr 19th July 1912).
The ﬁrst version of Bohr’s atom in his “Manchester memorandum” than com-
bined Thomsonian modeling with a conviction drawn from his earlier work on
electron theory in metals, i.e. that within matter ordinary mechanics and electro-
dynamics is not sufﬁcient but has to be complemented by some quantum condition
(like in the theory of speciﬁc heats). In the case of the atom it was the mechanical
instability of the models that Bohr wanted to ﬁx by a quantum condition. While
he arrived at far-reaching results (explanation of periodic table, though by a wrong
calculation) and implemented a quantum condition to relate the kinetic energy of
the electrons to the frequency of rotation, Ekin = K · ν this ﬁrst version of the Bohr
atom would not take off (Fig. 1).

Bohr’s Atomic Model
Only after Bohr stumbled upon a publications of J. W. Nicholson (1881–1955)
late in 1912, who had constructed an comparably immature atomic model also
with a quantum condition in order to explain the spectral lines of the solar corona,
Bohr realized that  spectroscopy was the missing link for establishing a sound
atomic model. Disregarding spectra was not a particular failure of Bohr, since
their complexity and the futile search for explanation rejected most atom builders.
Nicholson’s work motivated Bohr to combine his initial model with Planck’s (1858–
1947) quantized oscillator thus postulating series of states with quantized energy.
The prize he had to pay was to obscure the nature of the atomic vibrations, or
positively turned, this amounted to the most important step towards a quantized
atomic model in which the frequency of revolution are disconnected with the fre-
quencies of radiation that simply equate from the energy difference of two atomic
states expressed in terms of  Planck’s constant: EnEm = hνnm. With this separa-
tion of optical and mechanical frequencies, obviously, the “little piece of reality”
the model might claim had become even smaller. However, the good accord with
the Balmer series nνnm = Z2R[(1/m2) −(1/n2)] provided irresistible persuasive-
ness in favor of this new atomic model which amounted to a perfect compromise of
general (mechanical) intelligibility and modern (fascinating) quantum properties.
It must have been this attractive combination that made Arnold Sommerfeld
(1868–1951) adopting and extending Bohr’s model, while Rutherford immedi-
ately scolded Bohr for the lack of a mechanism for the electrons to change from
one state to another and Thomson just kept on lecturing his atomic theory un-
changed. Bohr himself was quite aware of the makeshift character of his theory
and appeared pessimistic to many colleagues. This may indicate that besides the
spectroscopic success additional factors were necessary for the general recogni-
tion of Bohr’s achievement, factors that for some reason where most favorable in
(war-time) Germany.
While in G¨ottingen Peter Debye (1884–1966) extended the model to the hy-
drogen molecule and met experimental results on dispersion convincingly, it was
Sommerfeld who took up Bohr’s model most forcefully and guided a young gen-
eration of German physicists into the reﬁnement of Bohr’s theory. Though already
mentioned by Bohr only the Munich group worked out the generalization of elec-
tron orbits to elliptic ones into a systematic theory and hence introduced a second
quantum number for labeling the possible states of the atoms. In combination
with relativistic corrections and consideration of the co-movement of the nucleus
 Sommerfeld School mastered the ﬁne-structure of spectral lines to great exper-
imental unison. Further  quantum numbers and  selection rules for describing
possible transitions between states transformed  atomic physics to a “number mys-
ticism” while heavy use of pictures for representing complex systems of electron
orbits at the same time provided an engineering type of approach to it. Sommer-
feld’s promotion of the reﬁned Bohr model between 1917 and 1925 would include
non-specialized university lectures, articles in popular science journals, wood and
brass models for the Deutsches Museum as well as radio programs.
With the older scientists largely skeptical, the Bohr atom won recognition
among wider scientiﬁc and lay circles by popularization. Although as early as 1916

problems of the theory to account for anomalous dispersion appeared the momen-
tum the pictorial representation of the new understanding of matter developed could
not anymore be rescinded. Further progress in atomic theory only developed when
Bohr’s central postulate of the separation of optical and mechanical frequencies
was put aside and Hendrik Kramers (1894–1952) at Bohr’s institute associated with
each stationary state of Bohr’s atom a harmonic oscillator with frequencies equal to
those emitted and absorbed. Similarly did Heisenberg (1901–1976)ﬁnd his way to a
quantum mechanical reinterpretation of mechanical relations only after abandoning
graphic models and turning to dispersion theory with virtual oscillators.
The Bohr atom has served many scientists, educators and philosophers as ex-
emplar. Notions like “Rutherford–Bohr atom”  Bohr’s atomic model, Rutherford
atom are commonplace, logical and rational reconstructions of the (conceived)
research have been undertaken and even analyses of Bohr’s (idealized) research
programs are at hand [8, 10]. All these however, have always to be judged against
the rich historical sources that rather provide a complex and coincidental picture of
the historical path.
