The discovery of the electron was a complex and extended process, stretching from
Faraday’s investigation of electrolysis to Millikan’s oil-drop experiments [18]. The
results of four different ﬁelds (electrochemistry, electromagnetic theory,  spec-
troscopy, and  cathode rays) converged to support the existence of a novel
subatomic constituent of matter. Faraday’s experiments on electrolysis, interpreted
from the perspective of the atomic theory of matter, implied that electricity has
an atomic structure [4]. That is, electricity appears in naturally occurring units. In
1891 George Johnstone Stoney (1826–1911) named those units “electrons” ([13],
p. 583, [30]).
In 1894 Stoney’s electrons were appropriated by Joseph Larmor (1857–1942) to
overcome certain empirical and conceptual problems faced by Maxwell’s electro-
magnetic theory ([6], pp. 806 ff.). Larmor’s electrons were supposed to be universal
constituents of matter and were represented as structures in the all-pervading ether.
On the continent a similar electromagnetic theory had been proposed by Hendrik
Antoon Lorentz (1853–1928),who developed a synthesis of British and Continental
traditions in electromagnetism [7]. Lorentz’s theory incorporated Maxwell’s sug-
gestion that electromagnetic phenomena are wave processes in the ether and the
suggestion of continental theorists (e.g., Wilhelm Weber) that these phenomena are
due to the action of charged particles. Lorentz named those particles “ions”, in anal-
ogy with the ions of electrolysis.
A crucial event for the development of Larmor’s and Lorentz’s theories was
an experimentally discovery by Pieter Zeeman (1865–1943). In 1896 Zeeman ob-
served that the spectral lines of sodium widen under the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld
( Zeeman effect). Drawing on Lorentz’s theory, he attributed the modiﬁcation of
the sodium spectrum to the inﬂuence of magnetism on the mode of vibration of the
“ions”. From the observed widening he was able to calculate their charge to mass
ratio, which to everyone’s surprise turned out to be three orders of magnitude larger
than that of the electrolytic ions [17]. That was the ﬁrst indication that Lorentz’s
ions, as well as Larmor’s electrons, were much smaller than ordinary ions. In 1899
Lorentz changed the name of his “ions” to “electrons” [18].

Electrons
Electron theories received additional support by the theoretical and experimental
investigation of  cathode rays. The nature of those rays had been the subject of
considerable debate. The controversy subsided in 1897, when J. J. Thomson (1856–
1940) showed that they were composed of “corpuscles”, minute charged particles.
From the electric and magnetic deﬂections of those particles he calculated their
mass to charge ratio (m/e). It turned out that the value of m/e was three orders of
magnitude smaller than “the smallest value of this quantity previously known, and
which is the value for the hydrogen ion in electrolysis” ( [15], p. 310).
In 1899 Thomson reported measurements of the mass to charge ratio of the par-
ticles produced in the  photoelectric effect as well as by thermionic emission.
Those measurements indicated that the particles in question were identical with the
constituents of cathode rays [16]. Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) reached a similar
conclusion about the identity of the recently discovered β-rays, which were shown to
be “entirely comparable to . . . cathode rays, or masses of negative electricity trans-
ported with great speed” ([1], p. 210). Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century
the electron had surfaced in a variety of theoretical and experimental contexts.
In the beginning of the twentieth century, β-rays were employed as a tool to
adjudicate between contemporary electromagnetic theories, which gave different
accounts of the electron’s shape and structure. First, the theory developed by Max
Abraham (1875–1922) implied that the electron was a rigid sphere with a uniform
(surface or volume) distribution of charge, whose shape was not affected by its mo-
tion through the ether. Second, according to H. A. Lorentz’s theory of electrons and
Albert Einstein’s relativity theory, the electron was deformable and contracted in
the direction of its motion. Third, Alfred Bucherer (1863–1927) and Paul Langevin
(1872–1946) suggested that a moving electron would be deformed but its volume
would remain constant. All of those theories implied that the mass of the elec-
tron depended on its velocity. However, their quantitative predictions about that
dependence differed. Walter Kaufmann (1871–1947) undertook an experimental re-
search program that aimed at elucidating the nature of the electron’s mass and its
variation with velocity. He determined the velocity dependence of the charge to mass
ratio of β-rays, on the basis of their electric and magnetic deﬂections. His results
seemed to contradict the predictions of the “Lorentz–Einstein” theory and to fa-
vor the theories of Abraham, Bucherer, and Langevin [5]. Lorentz, for one, thought
“very likely that we shall have to relinquish this idea [of a deformable electron] al-
together” ([8], p. 213). His pessimism, however, was not vindicated by subsequent
developments. By the mid-1910s the combined efforts of theoreticians and experi-
mentalists had shown that Kaufmann’s results were erroneous [20,24–26].
The 1910s saw the culmination of a research program that aimed at measuring
the charge of the electron. Its origins go back to the late nineteenth century and
the experimental method devised by C. T. R. Wilson (1869–1959) to obtain artiﬁ-
cial clouds and raindrops. J. J. Thomson employed Wilson’s method to measure the
charge of the “ions” (i.e., electrons) liberated “when a negatively electriﬁed metal
plate . . . is illuminated by ultra-violet light” ( [16], p. 548). Thomson’s work, as well
as subsequent efforts along similar lines, were beset by many uncertainties (e.g., due
to the evaporation of cloud droplets). Their main limitation was that they provided

information about the statistical average of a great number of individual charges.
Those difﬁculties were met by Robert Millikan (1868–1953). From 1909 onwards
Millikan was able to get a grip on individual electrons. His meticulous observa-
tions of charged oil drops, moving under the simultaneous action of gravity and an
electric ﬁeld, enabled him to measure the charge of individual electrons [9]. Those
measurements established that electricity has an atomic structure and eliminated the
possibility of the electron being “a statistical mean of charges which are themselves
greatly divergent” ( [11], p. 58; cf. [23]). Thus, they provided “[t]he most direct and
unambiguous proof of the existence of the electron” ( [10], p. 55].
The electron also played a key role in the development of  atomic models [22].
From 1913 to 1928 a quantum physics of the electron was gradually developed.
Niels Bohr (1885–1962) and Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1951) imposed restrictive
conditions on the size, shape, and direction in space of the orbit of electrons bound
within the atom. Those conditions were expressed as  quantum numbers, which
“denote the state of the electron in question” ( [12], p. 150). In 1924 Wolfgang
Pauli (1900–1958) attributed a fourth quantum number to the electron in an at-
tempt to come to terms with the complexities of the anomalous Zeeman effect and
the regularities of the periodic table. Furthermore, Pauli formulated an  exclu-
sion principle, which prohibited the coexistence of identical electrons (i.e., with the
same quantum numbers) in the same atom. In 1925 Samuel Goudsmit (1902–1978)
and George Uhlenbeck (1900–1988) proposed a semi-classical interpretation of the
fourth quantum number as a manifestation of  spin, that is, as a self-rotation of
the electron. This interpretation led to several paradoxes ( errors and paradoxes in
quantum mechanics) and was subsequently abandoned [18]. Spin was reconceptu-
alized as a quantum mechanical property with no classical correlate. However, the
incorporation of spin into the new quantum mechanics encountered difﬁculties, un-
til P. A. M. Dirac (1902–1984) showed in 1928 that spin could be derived from his
relativistic wave equation [27].
During the 1920s the wave character of the electron was also established. In
1923 Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) developed a synthesis of particle and wave
conceptions of matter. The wave properties of matter implied that “[a] group of
electrons that traverses a sufﬁciently small aperture will exhibit diffraction effects”
([2], p. 549; transl. in [29], p. 263;  matter waves;  de Broglie wavelength). De
Broglie’s suggestion was conﬁrmed in 1927–28, when Clinton Davisson (1881–
1958) and Lester Germer (1896–1971) in the US and George Paget Thomson
(1892–1975) in England discovered experimentally electron diffraction [3, 14, 28]
 Davisson–Germer experiment.

Ensembles in Quantum Mechanics
Leslie E. Ballentine
The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description
of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which immediately
become unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles
of systems and not to individual systems.
– Albert Einstein (1879–1955) [1], p. 671.
This quotation is perhaps the most famous statement of the ensemble interpreta-
tion of quantum mechanics. The role of the ensemble in quantum mechanics ranges
from innocuous to profound, and even controversial.
The innocuous role of the ensemble stems from the fact that quantum mechan-
ics does not predict the actual events, but only the probabilities of the various
possible outcomes ( probability in quantum mechanics) of the various possible
events. In order to compare the predictions of quantum mechanics with experiment,
one must prepare a  state and measure some dynamical variable, and repeat this
preparation–measurementsequence many times. The relative frequencies of the var-
ious outcomes in this ensemble of results can then be compared with the theoretical
probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics. Thus it is natural to say that quantum
mechanics describes the statistics of an ensemble of similarly prepared systems.
Here, as in classical statistical mechanics, one should not confuse the ensemble
of systems with an assembly of systems into a composite. For example, if the system
is a single particle, then the ensemble is a conceptual set of replicas of it, each in its
own environment, whereas the assembly would be a many-particle system. The role
of the ensemble is to enable statistical analysis; its members do not interact with or
inﬂuence each other.
The more signiﬁcant role of the ensemble interpretation is exempliﬁed by
 Schr¨odinger’s cat paradox [2], which involves an unstable atom, a cat, and a
mechanism that releases a poison to kill the cat when the atom decays. The initial
state vector of the system, |φ1⟩|live⟩, describes an atom in an excited state and a
live cat. The ﬁnal state vector, after the atom has decayed and the cat is dead, will
