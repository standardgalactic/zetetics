Color Charge Degree of Freedom
in Particle Physics
O.W. Greenberg
Color has two facets in  particle physics. One is as a three-valued charge degree of
freedom, analogous to electric charge as a degree of freedom in electromagnetism.
The other is as a  gauge symmetry, analogous to the U(1) gauge theory of elec-
tromagnetism. Color as a three-valued charge degree of freedom was introduced by
Oscar W. Greenberg [1] in 1964. Color as a gauge symmetry was introduced by
Yoichiro Nambu [2] and by Moo Young Han and Yoichiro Nambu [3] in 1965. The
union of the two contains the essential ingredients of  Quantum Chromodynamics,
QCD. The word “color” in this context is purely colloquial and has no connection
with the the color that we see with our eyes in everyday life.
The theoretical and experimental background to the discovery of color centers
around events in 1964. In 1964 Murray Gell-Mann [4] and George Zweig [5] inde-
pendently proposed what are now called “quarks,” particles that are constituents of
the observed strongly interacting particles, “hadrons,” such as protons and neutrons.
Quarks gave a simple way to account for the  quantum numbers of the hadrons.
However quarks were paradoxical in that they had fractional values of their elec-
tric charges, but no such fractionally charged particles had been observed. Three
“ﬂavors” of quarks, up, down, and strange, were known at that time. The group
SU(3)ﬂavor, acting on these three ﬂavors, gave an approximate symmetry that led
to mass formulas for the hadrons constructed with these quarks. However the spin
1/2 of the quarks was not included in the model. (Quarks, see also  Mixing and
Oscillations of Particles; Particle Physics; Parton Model; QCD; QFT.)
The quark spin 1/2 and the symmetry SU(2)spin acting on the two states of spin
1/2 were introduced in the model by Feza G¨ursey and Luigi Radicati [6]. They
combined SU(2)spin with SU(3)ﬂavor into a larger SU(6)spin−ﬂavor symmetry. This
larger symmetry uniﬁed the previously known mass formulas for the octet of spin-
1/2 baryons and the decuplet of spin-3/2 baryons. Using this SU(6) theory Mirza
A.B. B´eg, Benjamin W. Lee and Abraham Pais [7] calculated the ratio of the mag-
netic moments of the proton and neutron to be -3/2, which agrees with experiment to
within 3%. However the successful SU(6) theory required that the conﬁguration of
the quarks that gave the correct lowlying baryons must be in a symmetric state under
permutations. This contradicts the  spin statistics theorem of Wolfgang Pauli [8],
according to which quarks as spin-1/2 particles have  Fermi statistics and must be
in an antisymmetric state under permutations.
In the same year 1964 Oscar W. Greenberg [1] recognized that this contradiction
could be resolved by allowing quarks to have a new hidden three-valued charge,
expressed in terms of parafermi statistics of order three. This was the discovery of
color. The antisymmetrization of the hidden degree of freedom allows the quarks

in baryons to be in the observed symmetric conﬁguration of the visible degrees of
freedom: space, spin and ﬂavor. Greenberg called this model the “symmetric quark
model” for baryons. As an observable test of this model, Greenberg constructed a
table of the spin,  parity, isospin and strangeness of the orbital excitations of the
ground-state quark conﬁgurations in this model.
In 1964 the hidden color charge on top of the fractionally charged quarks seemed
unduly speculative to some. Independent evidence for the existence of color came
when measurements of the properties of excited baryons conﬁrmed the predictions
of the symmetric quark model. It was only in 1968 that Haim Harari [9], as rap-
porteur for baryon spectrocopy, adopted the symmetric quark model as the correct
model of baryons.
Additional evidence for color came from the ratio of the annihilation cross sec-
tion for e+e−→hadrons to that for e+e−→μ+μ−and from the decay rate for
π0 →γ γ . Both of these follow from the gauge theory and the parastatistics version
of color. Further consequences of color require the gauged theory of color, quantum
chromodynamics,  QCD, described below.
In 1965 Yoichiro Nambu [2] and, in a separate paper, Moo Young Han and
Yoichiro Nambu [3] proposed a model with three sets of quark triplets. Their model
has two different SU(3) symmetries. One called SU(3)′ has the original SU(3)ﬂavor
symmetry of the quark model and the other, called SU(3)′′, makes explicit the hid-
den three-valued color charge degree of freedom that had been introduced in the
parastatistics model of Greenberg. This model allows the SU(3)′′, which can be
identiﬁed with the present SU(3)color if the quark charges are chosen fractional, to
be gauged. Indeed Nambu [2] and Han and Nambu [3] introduced an octet of what
we now call “gluons” as the mediator of the force between the quarks. The gauging
of the three-valued color charge carried by quarks with fractional electric charges is
the present QCD, the accepted theory of the strong interactions.
The model of Han and Nambu assigned integer charges to their three triplets to
avoid the fractional electric charges of the original quark model. This aspect of the
Han-Nambu model conﬂicts both with experiment and with exact color symmetry
and is not part of QCD. Greenberg and Daniel Zwanziger [10] made the identity
of the 3 of parafermi statistics of order 3 and the 3 of SU(3)color with fractionally-
charged quarks explicit in 1966.
In addition to the consequences of the parastatistics model, QCD leads to other
important results. These include (a) permanent conﬁnement of quarks and color, (b)
asymptotic freedom  QCD; QFT, discovered by David J. Gross [11], H. David
Politzer [12] and Frank Wilczek [11] in 1973, which reconciles the low energy be-
havior of quarks conﬁned in hadrons with the quasi-free behavior of quarks that
interact at high energy and momentum transfer in the  parton model, (c) running
of coupling constants and high-precision tests of QCD at high energy, and (d) jets
in high energy collisions.

Complementarity Principle
Henry Stapp
Niels Bohr introduced and explained his concept of “complementarity” in his
famous 1927 Como Lecture (reproduced in [1]. He recognized the need for the
mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics to be imbedded in a rationally co-
herent conceptual framework if it were to serve as the core of an acceptable scientiﬁc
theory. Yet the applications of the formalism were based upon the integration of
two logically incompatible conceptual structures, the mathematical formalisms of
classical and quantum physics. The applications that we normally make of quantum
