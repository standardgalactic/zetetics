Preface
This book is the result of the author’s struggle to understand modern
physics. It is inspired by my readings of standard physics literature, but
is, really, just a study of the mathematical notion of moduli, based upon
my version of non-commutative algebraic geometry. Physics enters in the
following way: If we want to study a phenomenon, P, in the real world,
we have, since Galileo Galilei, been used to associate to P a mathematical
object X, the mathematical model of P, assumed to contain all the informa-
tion we would like to extract from P. The isomorphism classes, [X], of such
objects X, form a space M, the moduli space of the objects X, on which we
may put diﬀerent structures. The assumptions made, makes it reasonable
to look for a dynamical structure, which to every point x = [X] ∈M, pre-
pared in some well deﬁned manner, creates a (directed) curve in M, through
x, modeling the future of the phenomenon P. Whenever this works, time
seems to be a kind of metric, on the space, M, measuring all changes in P.
It turns out that non-commutative algebraic geometry, in my tapping, fur-
nishes, in many cases, the necessary techniques to construct, both the mod-
uli space M, and a universal dynamical structure, Ph∞(M), from which
we may deduce both time and dynamics for non-trivial models in physics.
See the introduction for a thorough explanation of the terms used here.
The fact that the introduction of a non-commutative deformation theory,
the basic ingredient in my version of non-commutative algebraic geometry,
might lead to a better understanding of the part of modern physics that I
had never understood before, occurred to me during a memorable stay at
the University of Catania, Italy in 1992. To check this out, has since then
been my main interest, and hobby.

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1
Philosophy
In a ﬁrst paper on this subject, see [20], we sketched a toy model in physics,
where the space-time of classical physics became a section of a universal
ﬁber space ˜E, deﬁned on the moduli space, H := Hilb(2)(E3), of the phys-
ical systems we chose to consider, in this case the systems composed of
an observer and an observed, both sitting in Euclidean 3-space, E3. This
moduli space is easily computed, and has the form H = ˜H/Z2, where
H = k[t1, ..., t6], k = R and H := Spec(H) is the space of all ordered pairs
of points in E3, ˜H is the blow-up of the diagonal, and Z2 is the obvious
group-action. The space H, and by extension, H and ˜H, was called the
time-space of the model.
Measurable time, in this mathematical model, turned out to be a metric
ρ on the time-space, measuring all possible inﬁnitesimal changes of the state
of the objects in the family we are studying. A relative velocity is now an
oriented line in the tangent space of a point of ˜H.
Thus the space of
velocities is compact.
This lead to a physics where there are no inﬁnite velocities, and where
the principle of relativity comes for free. The Galilean group, acts on E3,
and therefore on ˜H. The Abelian Lie-algebra of translations deﬁnes a 3-
dimensional distribution, ˜∆in the tangent bundle of ˜H, corresponding to 0-
velocities. Given a metric on ˜H, we deﬁne the distribution ˜c, corresponding
to light-velocities, as the normal space of ˜∆. We explain how the classical
space-time can be thought of as the universal space restricted to a subspace
˜
S(l)of ˜H, deﬁned by a ﬁxed line l ⊂E3. In chapter 4, under the section
Time-Space and Space-Times, we shall also show how the generator τ ∈Z2,
above, is linked to the operators C, P, T in classical physics, such that
1

2
Geometry of Time-Spaces
τ 2 = τPT = id. Moreover, we observe that the three fundamental gauge
groups of current quantum theory U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) are part of the
structure of the ﬁber space,
˜E −→˜H.
In fact, for any point t = (o, x) in H, outside the diagonal ∆, we may
consider the line l in E3 deﬁned by the pair of points (o, x) ∈E3 × E3. We
may also consider the action of U(1) on the normal plane Bo(l), of this line,
oriented by the normal (o, x), and on the same plane Bx(l), oriented by the
normal (x, o). Using parallel transport in E3, we ﬁnd an isomorphisms of
bundles,
Po,x : Bo →Bx, P : Bo ⊕Bx →Bo ⊕Bx,
the partition isomorphism. Using P we may write, (v, v) for (v, Po,x(v) =
P((v, 0)). We have also seen, in loc.cit., that the line l deﬁnes a unique
sub scheme H(l) ⊂H. The corresponding tangent space at (o, x), is called
A(o,x). Together this deﬁne a decomposition of the tangent space of H,
TH = Bo ⊕Bx ⊕A(o,x).
If t = (o, o) ∈∆, and if we consider a point o′ in the exceptional ﬁber Eo
of ˜H we ﬁnd that the tangent bundle decomposes into,
T ˜
H,o′ = Co′ ⊕Ao′ ⊕˜∆,
where Co′ is the tangent space of Eo, Ao′ is the light velocity deﬁning o′
and ˜∆is the 0-velocities. Both Bo and Bx as well as the bundle C(o,x) :=
{(ψ, −ψ) ∈Bo⊕Bx}, become complex line bundles on H−∆. C(o,x) extends
to all of ˜H, and its restriction to Eo coincides with the tangent bundle.
Tensorising with C(o,x), we complexify all bundles. In particular we ﬁnd
complex 2-bundles CBo and CBx, on H −∆, and we obtain a canonical
decomposition of the complexiﬁed tangent bundle.
Any real metric on
H will decompose the tangent space into the light-velocities ˜c and the 0-
velocities, ˜∆, and obviously,
TH = ˜c ⊕˜∆, CTH = C˜c ⊕C ˜∆.
This decomposition can also be extended to the complexiﬁed tangent bundle
of ˜H. Clearly, U(1) acts on TH, and SU(2) and SU(3) acts naturally on
CBo ⊕CBx and C ˜∆respectively. Moreover SU(2) acts on CCo′, in such a
way that their actions should be physically irrelevant. U(1), SU(2), SU(3)
are our elementary gauge groups.

Introduction

The above example should be considered as the most elementary one,
seen from the point of view of present day physics. In fact, whenever we
try to make sense of something happening in nature, we consider ourselves
as observing something else, i.e. we are working with an observer and an
observed, in some sort of ambient space, and the most intuitively acceptable
such space, today, is obviously the 3-dimensional Euclidean space.
However, the general philosophy behind this should be the following. If
we want to study a natural phenomenon, called P, we would, in the present
scientiﬁc situation, have to be able to describe P in some mathematical
terms, say as a mathematical object, X, depending upon some parameters,
in such a way that the changing aspects of P would correspond to altered
parameter-values for X. X would be a model for P if, moreover, X with any
choice of parameter-values, would correspond to some, possibly occurring,
aspect of P.
Two mathematical objects X(1), and X(2), corresponding to the same
aspect of P, would be called equivalent, and the set, M, of equivalence
classes of these objects should be called the moduli space of the models, X.
The study of the natural phenomenon P, would then be equivalent to the
study of the structure of M. In particular, the notion of time would, in
agreement with Aristotle and St. Augustin, see [20], be a metric on this
space.
With this philosophy, and this toy-model in mind we embarked on the
study of moduli spaces of representations (modules) of associative algebras
in general, see Chapter 3.
Introducing the notion of dynamical structure, on the space, M, as we
shall in (4.1), via the construction of Phase Spaces, see Chapter 2, we then
have a complete theoretical framework for studying the phenomenon P,
together with its dynamics.
1.2
Phase Spaces, and the Dirac Derivation
For any associative k-algebra A we have, in [20], and Chapter 2, deﬁned a
phase space Ph(A), i.e. a universal pair of a morphism ι : A →Ph(A), and
an ι- derivation, d : A →Ph(A), such that for any morphism of algebras,
A →R, any derivation of A into R decomposes into d followed by an
A- homomorphism Ph(A) →R, see [20], and [21]. These associative k-
algebras are either trivial or non-commutative. They will give us a natural
framework for quantization in physics. Iterating this construction we obtain

4
Geometry of Time-Spaces
a limit morphism ιn : Phn(A) →Ph∞(A) with image Ph(n)(A), and a
universal derivation δ ∈Derk(Ph∞(A), Ph∞(A)), the Dirac derivation.
This Dirac derivation will, as we shall see, create the dynamics in our
diﬀerent geometries, on which we shall build our theory. For details, see
Chapter 2.
Notice that the notion of superspace is easily deduced from
the the Ph-construction. An aﬃne superspace corresponds to a quotient of
some Ph(A), where A is the aﬃne k-algebra of some scheme.
1.3
Non-commutative Algebraic Geometry, and Moduli of
Simple Modules
The basic notions of aﬃne non-commutative algebraic geometry related to
a (not necessarily commutative) associative k-algebra, for k an arbitrary
ﬁeld, have been treated in several texts, see [16], [17], [18], [19]. Given a
ﬁnitely generated algebra A, we prove the existence of a non-commutative
scheme-structure on the set of isomorphism classes of simple ﬁnite dimen-
sional representations, i.e. right modules, Simp<∞(A). We show in [18],
and [19], that any geometric k-algebra A, see Chapter 3, may be recov-
ered from the (non-commutative) structure of Simp<∞(A), and that there
is an underlying quasi-aﬃne (commutative) scheme-structure on each com-
ponent Simpn(A) ⊂Simp<∞(A), parametrizing the simple representations
of dimension n, see also [24], [25]. In fact, we have shown that there is a
commutative algebra C(n) with an open subvariety U(n) ⊆Simp1(C(n)),
an ´etale covering of Simpn(A), over which there exists a universal represen-
tation ˜V ≃C(n) ⊗k V , a vector bundle of rank n deﬁned on Simp1(C(n)),
and a versal family, i.e. a morphism of algebras,
˜ρ : A −→EndC(n)( ˜V ) →EndU(n)( ˜V ),
inducing all isoclasses of simple n-dimensional A-modules.
Suppose, in line with our Philosophy that we have uncovered the moduli
space of the mathematical models of our subject, and that A is the aﬃne k-
algebra of this space, assumed to contain all the parameters of our interest,
then the above construction furnishes the Geometric landscape on which
our Quantum Theory will be based.
Obviously, EndC(n)( ˜V ) ≃Mn(C(n)), and we shall use this isomorphism
without further warning.

1.4
Dynamical Structures
We have, above, introduced moduli spaces, both for our mathematical ob-
jects, modeling the physical realities, and for the dynamical variables of
interest to us. Now we have to put these things together to create dynam-
ics in our geometry.
A dynamical structure, see Deﬁnition (3.1), deﬁned for a space, or any
associative k-algebra A, is now an ideal (σ) ⊂Ph∞(A), stable under the
Dirac derivation, and the quotient algebra A(σ) := Ph∞(A)/(σ), will be
called a dynamical system.
These associative, but usually highly non-commutative, k-algebras are
the models for the basic aﬃne algebras creating the geometric framework
of our theory.
As an example, assume that A is generated by the space-coordinate
functions, {ti}d
i=1 of some conﬁguration space, and consider a system of
equations,
δntp := dntp = Γp(ti, dtj, d2tk, .., dn−1tl), p = 1, 2, ..., d.
Let (σ) := (δntp−Γp) be the two-sided δ-stable ideal of Ph∞(A), generated
by the equations above, then (σ) will be called a dynamical structure or a
force law, of order n, and the k-algebra,
A(σ) := Ph∞(A)/(σ),
will be referred to as a dynamical system of order n.
Producing dynamical systems of interest to physics, is now a major
problem. One way is to introduce the notion of Lagrangian, i.e. any element
L ∈Ph∞(A), and consider the Lagrange equation,
δ(L) = 0.
Any δ-stable ideal (σ) ⊂Ph∞(A), for which δ(L) = 0 (mod(σ)), will be
called a solution of the Lagrange equation. This is the non-commutative
way of taking care of the parsimony principles of Maupertuis and Fermat
in physics.
In the commutative case, the Dirac derivation of dynamical systems of
order 2 will have the form,
δ =
X
i
dti
∂
∂ti
+ d2ti
∂
∂dti
,
.

6
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Whenever A is commutative and smooth, we may consider classical
Lagrangians, like, L = 1/2 P
i,j gi,jdtidj ∈Ph(A), a non degenerate met-
ric, expressed in some regular coordinate system {ti}. Then the Lagrange
equations, produces a dynamical structure of order 2,
d2ti = −
X
j,k
Γi
j,kdtjdtk,
where Γ is given by the Levi-Civita connection.
One may also, for a general Lagrangian, L ∈Ph2(A) impose δ as the
time, and use the Euler-Lagrange equations, and obtain force laws, see
the discussion later in this introduction, and in the section (4.5) General
Quantum Fields, Lagrangians and Actions.
By deﬁnition, δ induces a derivation δσ ∈Derk(A(σ), A(σ)), also called
the Dirac derivation, and usually just denoted δ.
For diﬀerent Lagrangians, we may obtain diﬀerent Dirac derivations on
the same k-algebra A(σ), and therefore, as we shall see, diﬀerent dynamics
of the universal families of the diﬀerent components of Simpn(A(σ)), n ≥1,
i.e. for the particles of the system.
1.5
Quantum Fields and Dynamics
Any family of components of Simp(A(σ)), with its versal family ˜V , will,
in the sequel, be called a family of particles. A section φ of the bundle ˜V ,
is now a function on the moduli space Simp(A), not just a function on the
conﬁguration space, Simp1(A), nor Simp1(A(σ)). The value φ(v) ∈˜V (v)
of φ, at some point v ∈Simpn(A), will be called a state of the particle, at
the event v.
EndC(n)( ˜V ) induces also a bundle, of operators, on the ´etale covering
U(n) of Simpn(A(σ)). A section, ψ of this bundle will be called a quantum
ﬁeld. In particular, any element a ∈A(σ) will, via the versal family map,
˜ρ, deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld, and the set of quantum ﬁelds form a k-algebra.
Physicists will tend to be uncomfortable with this use of their language.
A classical quantum ﬁeld for any traditional physicist is, usually, a function
ψ, deﬁned on some conﬁguration space, (which is not our Simpn(A(σ)),
with values in the polynomial algebra generated by certain creation and
annihilation-operators in a Fock-space.
As we shall see, this interpretation may be viewed as a special case of
our general set-up. But ﬁrst we have to introduce Planck’s constant(s) and
Fock-space. Then in the section (4.6) Grand picture, Bosons, Fermions,

and Supersymmetry, this will be explained. There we shall also focus on the
notion of locality of interaction, see [11] p. 104, where Cohen-Tannoudji
gives a very readable explanation of this strange non-quantum phenomenon
in the classical theory, see also [30], the historical introduction.
Notice also that in physics books, the Greek letter ψ is usually used for
states, i.e. sections of ˜V , or in singular cases, see below, for elements of the
Hilbert space, on which their observables act, but it is also commonly used
for quantum ﬁelds. Above we have a situation where we have chosen to call
the quantum ﬁelds ψ, reserving φ for the states. This is also our language
in the section (4.6) Grand picture, Bosons, Fermions, and Supersymmetry.
Other places, we may turn this around, to ﬁt better with the comparable
notation used in physics.
Let v ∈Simpn(A(σ)) correspond to the right A(σ)-module V , with
structure homomorphism ρv : A(σ) →Endk(V ), then the Dirac derivation
δ composed with ρv, gives us an element,
δv ∈Derk(A(σ), Endk(V )).
Recall now that for any k-algebra B, and right B-modules V , W, there
is an exact sequence,
HomB(V, W) →Homk(V, W) →Derk(B, Homk(V, W) →Ext1
B(V, W) →0,
where the image of,
η : Homk(V, W) →Derk(B, Homk(V, W))
is the sub-vectorspace of trivial (or inner) derivations.
Modulo the trivial (inner) derivations, δv deﬁnes a class,
ξ(v) ∈Ext1
A(σ)(V, V ),
i.e. a tangent vector to Simpn(A(σ)) at v. The Dirac derivation δ therefore
deﬁnes a unique one-dimensional distribution in ΘSimpn(A(σ)), which, once
we have ﬁxed a versal family, deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld,
ξ ∈ΘSimpn(A(σ)),
and, in good cases, a (rational) derivation,
ξ ∈Derk(C(n))
inducing a derivation,
[δ] ∈Derk(A(σ), EndC(n)( ˜V )),

8
Geometry of Time-Spaces
lifting ξ, and, in the sequel, identiﬁed with ξ. By deﬁnition of [δ], there is
now a Hamiltonian operator
Q ∈Mn(C(n)),
satisfying the following fundamental equation, see Theorem (4.2.1),
δ = [δ] + [Q, ˜ρ(−)].
This equation means that for an element (an observable) a ∈A(σ) the
element δ(a) acts on ˜V ≃C(n)n as [δ](a) = ξ(˜ρV (a)) plus the Lie-bracket
[Q, ˜ρV (a)].
Notice that any right A(σ)-module V is also a Ph∞(A)-module, and
therefore corresponds to a family of Phn(A)-module-structures on V , for
n ≥1, i.e. to an A-module V0 := V , an element ξ0 ∈Ext1
A(V, V ), i.e. a
tangent of the deformation functor of V0 := V , as A-module, an element
ξ1 ∈Ext1
P h(A)(V, V ), i.e. a tangent of the deformation functor of V1 := V
as Ph(A)-module, an element ξ2 ∈Ext1
P h2(A)(V, V ), i.e. a tangent of the
deformation functor of V2 := V as Ph2(A)-module, etc. All this is just
V , considered as an A-module, together with a sequence {ξn}, 0 ≤n, of a
tangent, or a momentum, ξ0, an acceleration vector, ξ1, and any number of
higher order momenta ξn. Thus, specifying a point v ∈Simpn(A(σ)) im-
plies specifying a formal curve through v0, the base-point, of the miniversal
deformation space of the A-module V .
Knowing the dynamical structure, (σ), and the state of our object V at
a time τ0, i.e. knowing the structure of our representation V of the algebra
A(σ), at that time (which is a problem that we shall return to), the above
makes it reasonable to believe that we, from this, may deduce the state of
V at any later time τ1. This assumption, on which all of science is based,
is taken for granted in most textbooks in modern physics.
This paper
is, in fact, an attempt to give this basic assumption a reasonable basis.
The mystery is, of course, why Nature seems to be parsimonious, in the
sense of Fermat and Maupertuis, giving us a chance of guessing dynamical
structures.
The dynamics of the system is now given in terms of the Dirac vector-
ﬁeld [δ], generating the vector ﬁeld ξ on Simpn(A(σ)).
An integral
curve γ of ξ is a solution of the equations of motion.
Let γ start at
v0 ∈Simpn(A(σ)) and end at v1 ∈Simpn(A(σ)), with length τ1 −τ0.
This is only meaningful for ordered ﬁelds k, and when we have given a met-
ric (time) on the moduli space Simpn(A(σ)). Assume this is the situation.
Then, given a state, φ(v0) ∈˜V (v0) ≃V0, of the particle ˜V , we prove that

Introduction

there is a canonical evolution map, U(τ0, τ1) transporting φ(v0) from time
τ0, i.e. from the point representing V0, to time τ1, i.e. corresponding to
some point representing V1, along γ. It is given as,
U(τ0, τ1)(φ(v0)) = exp(
Z
γ
Qdτ)(φ(v0)),
where exp(
R
γ) is the non-commutative version of the classical action in-
tegral, related to the Dyson series, to be deﬁned later, see the proof of
Theorem (4.2.3) and the section (4.6) Grand picture. Bosons, Fermions,
and Supersymmetry. In case we work with unitary representations, of some
sort, we may also deduce analogies to the S-matrix, perturbation theory,
and so also to Feynman-integrals and diagrams.
1.6
Classical Quantum Theory
Most of the classical models in physics are either essentially commutative,
or singular, i.e. such that either Q = 0, or [δ] = 0. General relativity is an
example of the ﬁrst category, classical Yang-Mills theory is of the second
kind. In fact, any theory involving connections are singular, and inﬁnite
dimensional. But we shall see that imposing singularity on a theory, some-
times recover the classical inﬁnite dimensional (Hilbert-space-based) model
as a limit of the ﬁnite dimensional simple representations, corresponding
to a dynamic system, see Examples 4.2-4.4, where we treat the Harmonic
Oscillator.
1.7
Planck’s Constants, and Fock Space
This general model allows us also to deﬁne a general notion of a Planck’s
constant(s), ℏl, as the generator(s) of the generalized monoid,
Λ(σ) :={λ ∈C(n)|∃fλ ∈A(σ), fλ ̸= 0,
[Q, ˜ρ(δ(fλ))] = ˜ρ(δ(fλ)) −[δ](˜ρ(fλ)) = λ˜ρ(fλ)}
which has the property that λ, λ′ ∈Λ(σ), fλfλ′ ̸= 0 implies λ + λ′ ∈Λ(σ).
From this deﬁnition we may construct a general notion of Fock algebra,
or Fock space, and a representation, both named F, on this space. F is
the sub-k-algebra of EndC(n)( ˜V )) generated by {al
+ := fℏl, al
−:= f−ℏl},

dimensional harmonic oscillator in all ranks, and of the quartic anharmonic

oscillator in rank 2 and 3. Notice that this is just a natural generalization
of standard work on classiﬁcation of representations of (semi-simple) Lie
algebras, see the discussion of fundamental particles in the Example (4.14).
When A is the coordinate k-algebra of a moduli space, we should also
consider the family of Lie algebras of essential automorphisms of the objects
classiﬁed by Simp(A(σ)), and apply invariant theory, like in [18], to obtain
a general form for Yang-Mills theory, see [33] and [22], for the case of plane
curve singularities. This would oﬀer us a general model for the notions
of gauge particles and gauge ﬁelds, coupling with ordinary particles via
representations onto corresponding simple modules.
1.8
General Quantum Fields, Lagrangians and Actions
Perfectly parallel with this theory of simple ﬁnite dimensional representa-
tions, we might have considered, for given algebras A, and B, the space of
algebra homomorphisms,
φ : A →B.
In the commutative, classical case, when A is generated by t1, ..., tr, and
B is the aﬃne algebra of a conﬁguration space generated by x1, ..., xs, φ is
determined by the images φi := ˜φ(ti), and φ or {φi} is called a classical
ﬁeld. Any such ﬁeld, φ induces a unique commutative diagram of algebras,
A

φ
/ B

Ph(A)
P hφ / Ph(B).
Given dynamical structures, (say of order two), σ and µ, deﬁned on A,
respectively B, we construct a vector ﬁeld [δ] on the space, F(A(σ), B(µ)),
of ﬁelds, φ : A(σ) →B(µ). The singularities of [δ] deﬁnes a subset,
M := M(A(σ), B(µ)) ⊂F(A(σ), B(µ)) =: F.
There are natural equations of motion, analogous to those we have seen
above, see (3.2). Notice that a ﬁeld φ ∈M is said to be on shell, those of
F −M are oﬀshell. We shall explore the structure of M in some simple
cases.
The actual choice of dynamical structures (σ), (µ), for the particular
physical set-up, is, of course, not obvious. They may be deﬁned in terms
of force laws, but, in general, force laws do not pop up naturally. Instead,

Introduction
11
physicists are used to insist on the Lagrangian, an element L ∈Ph(A),
as a main player in this game.
The Lagrangian density, L should then
be considered an element of the versal family of the iso-clases of F(A, B).
In fact, assuming that this space has a local aﬃne algebraic geometric
structure, parametrized by some ring C, we may consider the versal family
as a homomorphisms of k-algebras,
˜φ : Ph(A) →C ⊗k Ph(B),
and put L := ˜φ(L). Classically one picks a (natural) representation, corre-
sponding to a derivation of B,
ρ : Ph(B) →B,
and put, L := ρ(L). One considers the Lagrangian density as a function in
φi, φi,j := ∂φi
∂xj , thus as a function on conﬁguration space Simp1(B), with
coeﬃcients from C. One postulates that there is a functional, or an action,
which, for every ﬁeld φ, associates a real or complex value,
S := S(L(φi, φi,j)),
usually given in terms of a trace, or as an integral of L on part of the
conﬁguration space, see below. S should be considered as a function on
F := F(A, B), i.e. as an element of C. The parsimony principles of Fermat
and Maupertuis is then applied to this function, and one wants to compute
the vector ﬁeld,
∇S ∈ΘF,
which mimic our [δ], derived from the Dirac derivations. The equation of
motion, i.e. the equations picking out the subspace M ⊂F, is therefore,
∇S = 0.
Here is where classical calculus of variation enters, and where we obtain
diﬀerential equations for φi, the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion.
Notice now that in an inﬁnite dimensional representation, the Trace is
an integral on the spectrum. The equation of motion deﬁning M ⊂F, now
corresponds to,
δS := δ
Z
˜ρ(L) = 0.
The calculus of variation produces Euler-Lagrange equations, and so picks
out the singularities of ∇S, the replacement for [δ], without referring to a
dynamical structure, or to (uni)versal families. See the Examples (3.7) and

12
Geometry of Time-Spaces
(3.8), where we treat the harmonic oscillator, and where we show that the
classical inﬁnite dimensional representation is a limit of ﬁnite dimensional
simple representations. We also show that the Lagrangian of the harmonic
oscillator produces a vector ﬁeld ∇S on Simp2(A(σ)) which is diﬀerent from
the one generated by the Dirac derivation for the dynamical system deduced
from the Euler-Lagrange equations for the same Lagrangian. However, the
sets of singularities for the two vector ﬁelds coincide.
This should never the less be cause for worries, since the world we can
test is ﬁnite. The inﬁnite dimensional mathematical machinery is obviously
just a computational trick.
Another problem with this reliance on the Parsimony Principle via La-
grangians, and the (commutative) Euler-Lagrange equations, is that, unless
we may prove that ∇S = [δ], for some dynamical structure σ, the philo-
sophically satisfying realization, that a preparation in A(σ) actually implies
a deterministic future for our objects, disappear, see above.
Otherwise, it is clear that the theory becomes more ﬂexible. It is easy
to cook up Lagrangians.
In QFT, when quantizing ﬁelds, physicists are, however, usually
strangely vague; suddenly they consider functions, {φi, φi,j}, on conﬁgu-
ration space, as elements in a k-algebra, introduce commutation relations
and start working as if these functions on conﬁguration space were oper-
ators. This is, maybe, due to the fact that they do not see the diﬀerence
between the role of B in the classical case, and the role of Ph(B), in quan-
tum theory.
1.9
Grand Picture. Bosons, Fermions, and Supersymmetry
With this done, we sketch the big picture of QFT that emerges from the
above ideas.
This is then used as philosophical basis for the treatment
of the harmonic oscillator, general relativity, electromagnetism, spin and
quarks, which are the subjects of the Examples (4.2) to (4.14).
In particular, we sketch, here and in Chapter 5, how we may treat the
problems of Bosons, Fermions, Anyons, and Super-symmetry.
1.10
Connections and the Generic Dynamical Structure
Moreover we shall see that, on a space with a non-degenerate metric, there
is a unique generic dynamical structure, (σ), which produces the most in-

teresting physical models. In fact, any connection on a bundle, induces
a representation of A(σ). We shall use this metod to quantize the Elec-
tromagnetic Field, as well as the Gravitational Field, obtaining generalized
Maxwell, Dirac and Einstein-type equations, with interesting properties, see
Examples (4.1), (4.13) and (4.14). The Levi-Civita connection turns out to
be a very particular singular representation for which the Hamiltonian is
identiﬁed with the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
1.11
Clocks and Classical Dynamics
At this point we need to be more interested in how to measure time. We
therefore discuss the notion of clocks in this picture, and we propose two
rather diﬀerent models, one called The Western clock, modeled on a free
particle in dimension 1, i.e. one with d2τ = 0, and another, called the
Eastern Clock, modeled on the harmonic oscillator in dimension 1, i.e. one
with d2τ = τ .
1.12
Time-Space and Space-Times
The application to the case of point-like particles in the ˜H-model is treated
in Example (3.5), mainly as an introduction to the study of the Levi-Civita
connection, in our tapping. Coupled with the non-trivial geometry of ˜H
we see a promising possibility of deﬁning notions like mass and charge, of
diﬀerent colors, related to the structure of ˜H along the diagonal ˜∆.
A
catchy way of expressing this would be that every point in our real world is
a black hole, outﬁtted with a density of, at least, mass and charge. Notice
that the dimension of ˜∆is 5, which brings about ideas like those of Kaluza
and Klein.
In particular, the deﬁnition of mass, and the deduction of Newton’s law
of gravitation, from the assumption that mass is a property of the geometry
of ˜H, related to the blow up along the diagonal, seems promising. A simple
example in this direction leads to a Schwarzschild-type geometry. The cor-
responding equations of motion reduces to Kepler’s laws, see the Example
(4.12). As another example, we shall again go back to our toy-model, where
the standard Gauge groups, U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) pop up canonically
and show that the results above can be used to construct a general geo-
metric theory closely related to general relativity and to quantum theory,
generalizing both. See the Examples (4.13), (4.14), where the action of

14
Geometry of Time-Spaces
the natural gauge group, on the canonically decomposed tangent bundle of
H, as described above, sets up a nice theory for elementary particles, spin,
isospin, hypercharge, including quarks. Here the notion of non-commutative
invariant space, plays a fundamental role. In particular, notice the possible
models for light and dark matter, or energy, hinted upon in the Examples
(4.13), and (4.14). Notice also that, in this toy model light cannot be de-
scribed as point-particles. There are no radars available for point-particles,
like in current general relativity. However, the quantized E-M works well to
explain communication with light. Moreover, as one might have expected,
a reasonable model of the process creating the universe as we see it, will
provide a better understanding of what we are modeling. This is the subject
of the next section.
1.13
Cosmology, Big Bang and All That
Our toy-model, i.e. the moduli space, H, of two points in the Euclidean
3-space, or its ´etale covering, ˜H, turns out to be created by the versal de-
formation of the obvious (non-commutative) singularity in 3-dimensions,
U := k < x1, x2, x3 > /(x1, x2, x3)2. In fact, it is easy to see that the versal
space of the deformation functor of the k-algebra U contains a ﬂat compo-
nent (a room in the modular suite, see [22]) isomorphic to ˜H. The modular
stratum (the inner room) is reduced to the base point. This furnishes a
nice model for The Universe with easy relations to classical cosmological
models, like those of Friedman-Robertson-Walker, and Einstein-de Sitter.
1.14
Interaction and Non-commutative Algebraic Geome-
try
In section 1.4, we shall introduce interactions, lifetime, decay and creation
of particles. The inspiration for this ﬁnal paragraph comes from elementary
physics concerning Cross-Sections, Resonance, and The Cluster Decompo-
sition Principle, see Weinberg, [30], I, (3.8).
The possibility of treating interaction between ﬁelds in a perfectly ge-
ometric way, with the usual metrics and connections replaced with a non-
commutative metric is, maybe, the most interesting aspect of the model
presented in this paper.
The essential point is that, in non-commutative algebraic geometry, say
in the space of representations of an algebra B, there is a tangent space,

Introduction
15
T(V, W) := Ext1
B(V, W), between any two points, V, W.
In particular,
if B = Ph(k[x1, ..., xn]), then any 1-dimensional representation of B is
represented as a pair (q, ξ), of a closed point q of Spec(k[x]), and a tangent
ξ at that point. Given two such points, (qi, ξi), i = 1, 2, an easy calculation
proves that T((q1, ξ1), (q2, ξ2)) is of dimension 1 if q1 ̸= q2, of dimension n if
q1 = q2, ξ1 ̸= ξ2, and of dimension 2n when (q1, ξ1) = (q2, ξ2), see Example
(1.1), (ii).
Now, just as we may talk about vector-ﬁelds, as the assignment of a
tangent vector to any point in space, and consider metrics as functions that
associate a length to any tangent-vector, we may consider ﬁelds of tangents
between any two points, and extend the notion of metric to measure the
length of such.
If we do, we ﬁnd very nice models for treating the notion of identical
particles, and interaction between ﬁelds, see the Examples (5.1), (5.2).
Finally, we shall not resist the temptation to attempt a formalization, in
our language, of the notion of Alternative Histories, see [6], p.140, and the
paper [7]. The result is another application of noncommutative deformation
theory which seems to be a promising tool in mathematical physics.
1.15
Apology
Referring to the historical introduction of Weinberg’s, The Quantum Theory
of Fields, see [30], where he quotes Heisenberg’s 1925-Manifesto, I must
confess that the present paper is based on the same positivistic philosophy
as the one Weinberg rules out.
But then, I am not a physicist, and this paper is a paper on geometry
of certain ﬁnitely generated non-commutative algebraic schemes, where I
have taken the liberty of using my version of the physicist jargon to make
the results more palpable.
Even though I see a lot of diﬃculties in the interpretation of the math-
ematical notions of my models, in a physics context, I hope that the model
I propose may help other mathematicians to gain faith in their jugend-
traums; sometime, somehow, to be able to understand some physics.
An attentive reader will also see that, if my modelist philosophy about
Nature, see above, should be taken seriously, it would reduce the physicists
work to deﬁne, in a mathematical language, the model of the object she is
studying, then with the help of a mathematician work out the moduli space
of all such models, deﬁne the inﬁnite phase space of this moduli space, guess

on a metric to deﬁne time, and a corresponding dynamical structure, and
give the result to the computer algebra group in Kaiserslautern, and hope
for the best.

and consider the functor,

It is representable by a k-algebra-morphism,
ι : A −→Ph(A),
with a universal family given by a universal derivation,
d : A −→Ph(A).
Ph (A) is relatively easy to compute. It can be constructed as the non-
commutative versal base of the deformation functor of the morphism ρ :
A →k[ϵ], see [20] and [21].
Clearly we have the identities,
d∗: Derk(A, A) = MorA(Ph(A), A),
and,
d∗: Derk(A, Ph(A)) = EndA(Ph(A)),
17

the last one associating d to the identity endomorphism of Ph. Let now
V be a right A-module, with structure morphism ρ : A →Endk(V ). We
obtain a universal derivation,
c : A −→Homk(V, V ⊗A Ph(A)),
deﬁned by, c(a)(v) = v ⊗d(a).
Using the long exact sequence, see the
introduction,
0 →HomA(V, V ⊗A Ph(A)) →Homk(V, V ⊗A Ph(A))
→ι Derk(A, HomA(V, V ⊗A Ph(A))) →κ Ext1
A(V, V ⊗A Ph(A)) →0,
we obtain the non-commutative Kodaira-Spencer class,
c(V ) := κ(c) ∈Ext1
A(V, V ⊗A Ph(A)),
inducing the Kodaira-Spencer morphism,
g : ΘA := Derk(A, A) −→Ext1
A(V, V ),
via the identity, ˜δ∗. If c(V ) = 0, then the exact sequence above proves that
there exist a ∇∈Homk(V, V ⊗A Ph(A)) such that ˜δ = ι(∇). This is just
another way of proving that ˜δ is given by a connection,
∇: Derk(A, A) −→Homk(V, V ).
As is well known, in the commutative case, the Kodaira-Spencer class gives
rise to a Chern character by putting,
chi(V ) := 1/i! ci(V ) ∈Exti
A(V, V ⊗A Ph(A)),
and if c(V ) = 0, the curvature R(V ) induces a curvature class,
R∇∈H2(k, A; ΘA, EndA(V )).
Any Ph(A)-module W, given by its structure map,
ρW : Ph(A) −→Endk(W)
corresponds bijectively to an induced A-module structure on W, and a
derivation δρ ∈Derk(A, Endk(W)), deﬁning an element,
[δρ] ∈Ext1
A(W, W),
see the introduction. Fixing this element we ﬁnd that the set of Ph(A)-
module structures on the A-module W is in one to one correspondence
with,
Endk(W)/EndA(W).

Phase Spaces and the Dirac Derivation
19
Conversely,
starting
with
an
A-module
V
and
an
element
δ
∈
Derk(A, Endk(V )), we obtain a Ph(A)-module Vδ. It is then easy to see
that the kernel of the natural map,
Ext1
P h(A)(Vδ, Vδ) →Ext1
A(V, V ),
induced by the linear map,
Derk(Ph(A), Endk(Vδ)) →Derk(A, Endk(V ))
is the quotient,
DerA(Ph(A), Endk(Vδ))/Endk(V ).
Remark 2.1. Since Ext1
A(V, V ) is the tangent space of the miniversal de-
formation space of V as an A-module, see e.g. [18], or the next chapter,
we see that the non-commutative space Ph(A) also parametrizes the set of
generalized momenta, i.e. the set of pairs of a simple module V ∈Simp(A),
and a tangent vector of Simp(A) at that point.
Example 2.1. (i) Let A = k[t], then obviously, Ph(A) = k < t, dt > and d
is given by d(t) = dt, such that for f ∈k[t], we ﬁnd d(f) = Jt(f) with the
notations of [19], i.e. the non-commutative derivation of f with respect to
t. One should also compare this with the non-commutative Taylor formula
of loc.cit. If V ≃k2 is an A-module, deﬁned by the matrix X ∈M2(k),
and δ ∈Derk(A, Endk(V )), is deﬁned in terms of the matrix Y ∈M2(k),
then the Ph(A)-module Vδ is the k < t, dt >-module deﬁned by the action
of the two matrices X, Y ∈M2(k), and we ﬁnd
e1
V : = dimkExt1
A(V, V ) = dimkEndA(V ) = dimk{Z ∈M2(k)| [X, Z] = 0}
e1
Vδ : = dimkExt1
P h(A)(Vδ, Vδ) = 8 −4 + dim{Z ∈M2(k)| [X, Z] = [Y, Z] = 0}.
We have the following inequalities,
2 ≤e1
V ≤4 ≤e1
Vδ ≤8.
(ii) Let A = k2 ≃k[x]/(x2 −r2), r ∈k, r ̸= 0, then,
Ph(A) = k < x, dx > /((x2 −r2), x · dx + dx · x).
Notice that Ph(A) just has 2 points, i.e. simple representations, given by,
k(r) : x = r, dx = 0, k(−r) : x = −r, dx = 0.
An easy computation shows that,
Ext1
P h(A)(k(α), k(α)) = 0, α = r, −r, Ext1
P h(A)(k(α), k(−α)) = k · ω,

20
Geometry of Time-Spaces
where ω is represented by the derivation given by ω(x) = 2r, ω(dx) = t ∈k
where t is the tension of this string of dimension −1, see end of §2, and
end of §3. Notice also that this is an example of the existence of tangents
between diﬀerent points, in non-commutative algebraic geometry.
(iii) Now, let A = k[x] := k[x1, x2, x3] and consider,
Ph(A) = k < x1, x2, x3, dx1, dx2, dx3 > /([xi, xj], d([xi, xj])).
Any rank 1 representation of A is represented by a pair of a closed point
q of Spec(k[x]), and a tangent p at that point. Given two such points,
(qi, pi), i = 1, 2, an easy calculation proves,
dimkExt1
P hA(k(q1, p1), k(q2, p2)) = 1, for q1 ̸= q2
dimkExt1
P hA(k(q1, p1), k(q2, p2)) = 3, for q1 = q2, , p1 ̸= p2
dimkExt1
P hA(k(q1, p1), k(q2, p2)) = 6, for (q1, p1) = (q2, p2)
Put xj(qi, pi) := qi,j, dxj((qi, pi) := pi,j, αj = q1,j −q2,j, βj = p1,j −
p2,j. See that for any element α ∈Homk(k((q1, p1)), k((q2, p2))) we have,
xjα = q1,jα, αxj = q2,jα, dxjα = p1,jα, αdxj = p2,jα,
with the obvious identiﬁcation. Any derivation
δ ∈Derk(PhA, Homk(k((q1, p1)), k((q2, p2))))
must satisfy the relations,
δ([xi, xj]) = [δ(xi), xj] + [xi, δ(xj)] = 0
δ([dxi, xj] + [xi, dxj]) = [δ(dxi), xj] + [dxi, δ(xj)] + [δ(xi), dxj] + [xi, δ(dxj)] = 0.
Using the above left-right action-rules, the result follows from the long exact
sequence computing Ext1
P hA. The two families of relations above give us
two systems of linear equations.
The ﬁrst, in the variables δ(x1), δ(x2), δ(x3), δ(dx1), δ(dx2), δ(dx3), with
matrix,


and the second, in the variables, δ(x1), δ(x2), δ(x3), with matrix,


−α2 α1

Phase Spaces and the Dirac Derivation
21
In particular we see that the trivial derivation given by,
δ(xi) = αi, δ(dxj) = βj,
satisﬁes the relations, and the generator of Ext1
P hA(k(q1, p1), k(q2, p2)) is
represented by,
δ(xi) = 0, δ(dxj) = αi.
This is, in an obvious sense, the vector −(q1, q2), and we notice that this
generator is of the type δ(d−), so it is an acceleration in Simp1(k[x]), see
the interpretation of this as an interaction in Chapter 5. It is not diﬃcult
to extend this result from dimension 3 to any dimension n.
(iv) Consider now the space of 2-dimensional representation of Ph(A).
It is an easy computation that any such is given by the actions,
x1 =

The angular momentum is now given by,

etc. And the isospin, see (3.18) and (3.19), has the form,

etc.
(v) Let A = M2(k), and let us compute Ph(A).
Clearly the exis-
tence of the canonical homomorphism, i : M2(k) →Ph(M2(k)) shows that
Ph(M2(k)) must be a matrix ring, generated, as an algebra, over M2(k) by
dϵi,j, i, j = 1, 2, where ϵi,j is the elementary matrix. A little computation

shows that we have the following relations,

From this follows that any section, ρ : Ph(M2(k)) →M2(k), of i : M2(k) →
Ph(M2(k)), is given in terms of an element φ ∈M2(k), such that ρ(da) =
[φ, a].
2.2
The Dirac Derivation
The phase-space construction may, of course, be iterated. Given the k-
algebra A we may form the sequence, {Phn(A)}1≤n, deﬁned inductively
by
Ph0(A) = A, Ph1(A) = Ph(A), ..., Phn+1(A) := Ph(Phn(A)).
Let in
0
: Phn(A) →Phn+1(A) be the canonical imbedding, and let
dn : Phn(A) →Phn+1(A) be the corresponding derivation. Since the com-
position of in
0 and the derivation dn+1 is a derivation Phn(A) →Phn+2(A),
there exist by universality a homomorphism in+1
1
: Phn+1(A) →Phn+2(A),
such that,
dn ◦in+1
1
= in
0 ◦dn+1.
Notice that we here compose functions and functors from left to right.
Clearly we may continue this process constructing new homomorphisms,
{in
j : Phn(A) →Phn+1(A)}0≤j≤n,
with the property,
dn ◦in+1
j+1 = in
j ◦dn+1.

i.e.
the Ph∗A is a semi-cosimplicial algebra.
The system of k-algebras
and homomorphisms of k-algebras {Phn(A), in
j }n,0≤j≤n has an inductive
(direct) limit, Ph∞A, together with homomorphisms,
in : Phn(A) −→Ph∞(A)
satisfying,
in
j ◦in+1 = in, j = 0, 1, .., n.
Moreover, the family of derivations, {dn}0≤n deﬁne a unique derivation,
δ : Ph∞(A) −→Ph∞(A),
the Dirac derivation, such that,
in ◦δ = dn ◦in+1,
and it is easy to see that this is a universal construction, i.e. any pair of a
morphism,
i : A −→B
and a derivation ξ ∈Derk(B), factorizes via Ph∞(A), and δ. Put
Ph(n)(A) := im in ⊆Ph∞(A)
Let for any associative algebra B, Rep(B) denote the category of B-
modules. The set of isomorphism-classes of B-modules is just a set, and
the map induced by the obvious forgetful functor,
ω : Rep(Ph∞(A)) −→Rep(A),
is just a set-theoretical map, although having a well deﬁned tangent map,
Tω : Ext1
P h∞(A)(V, V ) −→Ext1
A(V, V ).
As we shall see, assuming the algebra A of ﬁnite type, the set of sim-
ple ﬁnite dimensional A-modules form an algebraic scheme, Simp̸=∞(A).
Moreover,
Theorem 2.2.1 (Preparation). The canonical morphism i0
: A
→
Ph∞(A) parametrizes simple representations of A with ﬁxed momentum,
acceleration, and any number of higher order momenta.

24
Geometry of Time-Spaces
This should be understood in the following way. Consider, for any simple
A-module V , the exact sequence,
0 →EndA(V ) →Endk(V ) →Derk(A, Endk(V )) →Ext1
A(V, V ) →0.
Let ρ : A →Endk(V ) deﬁne the structure of V , then any morphism ρ1 :
Ph(A) →Endk(V ) extending ρ, corresponds to a derivation, ξ1 : A →
Endk(V ), and therefore, via the maps in the exact sequence above, to
a tangent vector, also called ξ1, in the tangent space of the point v ∈
Simp(A) corresponding to V . So any such ξ1 corresponds to a couple (v, ξ)
of a point in Simp(A), and an inﬁnitesimal deformation of that point,
i.e.
a momentum.
Any morphism ρ2 : Ph2(A) →Endk(V ) extending
ρ1 corresponds therefore to the triple (v, ξ1, ξ2), corresponding to a point
and a momentum, and to an inﬁnitesimal deformation of this, etc. Since
we have canonical morphisms Phr(A) →Ph∞(A), it is clear that any
morphism ξ : Ph∞(A) →Endk(V ) extending ρ, produces a sequence,
of any order, of such tuples.
A simple consequence of the deﬁnition of
Ph∞(A), that we identify all in
q , q = 1, ..., n, shows that the set of such
morphisms ξ, extending a given structure-morphism, parametrizes the set
of formal curves in Simp(A) through v.
A fundamental problem of (our model of) physics, see the Introduction,
can now be stated as follows: If we prepare an object so that we know its
momentum, and its higher order momenta up to a certain order, what can
we infer on its behavior in the future?
In our mathematical model, a preparation made on the A-module, the
object, V , by ﬁxing its structure as a Ph∞(A)-module, now forces it to
change in the following way: The Dirac derivation δ ∈Derk(Ph∞(A))
maps via the structure homomorphism of the module V ,
ρV : Ph∞(A) −→Endk(V )
to an element δV ∈Derk(Ph∞(A), Endk(V )) and via the composition of
the canonical linear maps,
Derk(Ph∞(A), Endk(V )) −→Ext1
P h∞(A)(V, V ) −→Ext1
A(V, V )
to the element δ(V ) ∈Ext1
A(V, V ), i.e. to a tangent vector of Simpn(A)
at the point, v, corresponding to V , see [18]. Suppose ﬁrst that, δ(V ) is
0. This means that δV in Derk(Ph∞(A), Endk(V )) is an inner derivation
given by an endomorphism Q ∈Endk(V ), such that for every f ∈Ph∞(A),
we ﬁnd δ(f)(v) = (Qf −fQ)(v). This Q is the corresponding Hamiltonian,
(or Dirac operator in the terminology of Connes, see [29]), and we have a
situation that is very much like classical quantum mechanics, i.e. a set-up

Phase Spaces and the Dirac Derivation
25
where the objects are represented by a ﬁxed Hilbert space V and an algebra
of observables Ph∞(A) acting on it, with time, and therefore also energy,
represented by a special Hamiltonian operator Q.
A system characterized by a Ph∞(A)-module V , for which δ(V ) = 0,
will be called stable or singular. It is said to be in the state ψ if we have
chosen an element ψ ∈V .
The Dirac derivation δ deﬁnes a Hamiltonian
operator Q, (a Dirac operator), and time, i.e. δ, now push the state ψ into
the state,
exp(τQ)(ψ) ∈V,
corresponding to the isomorphism of the module V deﬁned by the inner iso-
morphism of the algebra of observables, Ph∞(A) deﬁned by U := exp(τδ),
whenever this is well deﬁned.
This is a well known situation i classical
quantum mechanics, corresponding to the equivalence between the set-ups
of Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg.
To treat the situation when [δ] ̸= 0, we ﬁrst have to take a new look at
non-commutative algebraic geometry, as developed in [17], [18], [19].

Chapter 3
Non-commutative Deformations and
the Structure of the Moduli Space of
Simple Representations
3.1
Non-commutative Deformations
In [16], [17] and [18], [19], we introduced non-commutative deformations
of families of modules of non-commutative k-algebras, and the notion of
swarm of right modules (or more generally of objects in a k-linear abelian
category). Let for any associative k-algebra S, aS be the category of S-
valued associative k-algebras, the objects of which are the diagrams of k-
algebras,
S →ι R →π S
such that the composition of ι and π is the identity.
In particular, ar
denotes the category of r-pointed k-algebras, i.e. as, with S = kr. Any
such r-pointed k-algebra R is isomorphic to a k-algebra of r × r-matrices
(Ri,j).
The radical of R is the bilateral ideal Rad(R) := kerπ, such that
R/Rad(R) ≃kr. The dual k-vector space of Rad(R)/Rad(R)2 is called
the tangent space of R.
For r = 1, there is an obvious inclusion of categories
l ⊆a1
where l, as usual, denotes the category of commutative local Artinian k-
algebras with residue ﬁeld k.
Fix a not necessarily commutative k-algebra A and consider a right
A-module M. The ordinary deformation functor
DefM : l →Sets
is then deﬁned. Assuming Exti
A(M, M) has ﬁnite k-dimension for i = 1, 2,
it is well known, see [28], or [16], that Def M has a pro-representing hull H,
27

28
Geometry of Time-Spaces
the formal moduli of M. Moreover, the tangent space of H is isomorphic to
Ext1
A(M, M), and H can be computed in terms of Exti
A(M, M), i = 1, 2
and their matric Massey products, see [15], [16], [21].
In the general case, consider a ﬁnite family V = {Vi}r
i=1 of right A-
modules. Assume that,
dimkExt1
A(Vi, Vj) < ∞.
Any such family of A-modules will be called a swarm. We shall deﬁne a
deformation functor,
DefV : ar →Sets
generalizing the functor Def M above. Given an object π : R = (Ri,j) →kr
of ar, consider the k-vector space and left R-module (Ri,j ⊗k Vj). It is easy
to see that EndR((Ri,j ⊗k Vj)) ≃(Ri,j ⊗k Homk(Vi, Vj)). Clearly π deﬁnes
a k-linear and left R-linear map,
π(R) : (Ri,j ⊗k Vj) →⊕r
i=1Vi,
inducing a homomorphism of R-endomorphism rings,
˜π(R) : (Ri,j ⊗k Homk(Vi, Vj)) →⊕r
i=1Endk(Vi).
The right A-module structure on the V ′
i s is deﬁned by a homomorphism of
k-algebras, η0 : A →⊕r
i=1Endk(Vi). Let
DefV(R) ∈Sets
be the set of isoclasses of homomorphisms of k-algebras,
η′ : A →(Ri,j ⊗k Homk(Vi, Vj))
such that,
˜π(R) ◦η′ = η0,
where the equivalence relation is deﬁned by inner automorphisms in the
k-algebra (Ri,j ⊗k Homk(Vi, Vj)) inducing the identity on ⊕r
i=1Endk(Vi).
One easily proves that DefV has the same properties as the ordinary de-
formation functor and we prove the following, see [15], [16], [21].
Theorem 3.1.1. The functor DefV has a pro-representable hull, i.e. an
object H of the category of pro-objects ˆar of ar, together with a versal family,
˜V = {(Hi,j ⊗Vj)}r
i=1 ∈lim
←−

DefV(H/mn),

Deformations and Moduli Spaces
29
where m = Rad(H), such that the corresponding morphism of functors on
ar,
κ : Mor(H, −) →DefV
deﬁned for φ ∈Mor(H, R) by κ(φ) = R ⊗φ ˜V , is smooth, and an isomor-
phism on the tangent level. Moreover, H is uniquely determined by a set of
matric Massey products deﬁned on subspaces,
D(n) ⊆Ext1(Vi, Vj1) ⊗· · · ⊗Ext1(Vjn−1, Vk),
with values in Ext2(Vi, Vk). The right action of A on ˜V deﬁnes a homo-
morphism of k-algebras, the versal family,
η : A −→O(V) := EndH( ˜V ) = (Hi,j ⊗Homk(Vi, Vj)),
and the k-algebra O(V) acts on the family of A-modules V = {Vi}, extend-
ing the action of A. If dimkVi < ∞, for all i = 1, ..., r, the operation of
associating (O(V), V) to (A, V) is a closure operation.
3.2
The O-construction
Moreover, in [16] we prove the crucial result,
Theorem 3.2.1 (A generalized Burnside theorem). Let A be a ﬁnite
dimensional k-algebra, k an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Consider the family
V = {Vi}r
i=1 of all simple A-modules, then
η : A −→O(V) = (Hi,j ⊗Homk(Vi, Vj))
is an isomorphism.
This result may be substantially generalized.
In fact, let S be any
ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra, and consider the category aS. An object is a
diagram,
R := (S →ι R →π S)
where R is a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra, and the composition ιπ = id.
Morphisms are the obvious commutative diagrams. Suppose we are given
a homomorphism of k-algebras,
ρ0 : A →EndS(V ),
where V is ﬁnite dimensional left S-module.
For any object, R ∈aS,
we may consider the left R-module R ⊗S V , and the homomorphism of
k-algebras,
π∗: EndR(R ⊗S V ) →EndS(V ).
The same arguments as above, then proves the more general result,

30
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Theorem 3.2.2 (The O-construction Theorem). Let V be any left S-
and right A-module, and consider the functor,
Def(SVA) : aS →Sets,
deﬁned by,
Def(SVA)(R) = {ρ ∈Mork(A, EndR(R ⊗S V )|φπ∗= ρ0}/ω,
where the equivalence relation ω is deﬁned by inner automorphisms in the
k-algebra EndR(R ⊗S V ), inducing the identity on EndS(V ). This functor
has a pro-representable hull, i.e. an object H, of the category of pro-objects
ˆaS of aS, with projection, ˆπ : H →S, together with a versal family,
˜V ∈lim
←−
n≥1
DefSVA(H/mn),
where m = Rad(H) := kerˆπ, such that the corresponding morphism of
functors on ar,
κ : Mor(H, −) →DefV
deﬁned for φ ∈Mor(H, R) by κ(φ) = R ⊗φ ˜V , is smooth, and an isomor-
phism on the tangent level. Moreover, H is uniquely determined by a set of
matric Massey products with values in Ext2(V, V ). The right action of A
on ˜V deﬁnes a homomorphism of k-algebras, the versal family,
η : A −→O(SVA) := EndH( ˜V ).
The k-algebra O := O(SVA) acts on the module V , extending the right-
action of A, commuting with the S-action. If dimkV < ∞, the operation
of associating (O(SVA), SVO) to (A, SVA), is a closure operation.
Notice that the proof of the closure property of the O-construction, as
proposed in [18], is incomplete, and should be replaced with the above.
Details will occur in a projected book.
We also proved that there exists, in the non-commutative deformation
theory, an obvious analogy to the notion of pro-representing (modular)
substratum H0 of the formal moduli H, see [14] and [22]. The tangent
space of H0 is determined by a family of subspaces
Ext1
0(Vi, Vj) ⊆Ext1
A(Vi, Vj),
i ̸= j
the elements of which should be called the almost split extensions (se-
quences) relative to the family V, and by a subspace,
T0(∆) ⊆
Y
i
Ext1
A(Vi, Vi)
which is the tangent space of the deformation functor of the full subcategory
of the category of A-modules generated by the family V = {Vi}r
i=1, see [15].
If V = {Vi}r
i=1 is the set of all indecomposables of some Artinian k-algebra
A, we show that the above notion of almost split sequence coincides with
that of Auslander, see [26].

3.3
Iterated Extensions
In [16], we consider the general problem of classiﬁcation of iterated exten-
sions of a family of modules V = {Vi, }r
i=1, and the corresponding classi-
ﬁcation of ﬁltered modules with graded components in the family V, and
extension type given by a directed representation graph Γ, see Chapter 4.
The main result is the following result, see [18],
Proposition 3.3.1. Let A be any k-algebra, V = {Vi}r
i=1 any swarm of
A-modules, i.e. such that,
dimk Ext1
A(Vi, Vj) < ∞
for all i, j = 1, . . . , r.
(i): Consider an iterated extension E of V, with representation graph
Γ. Then there exists a morphism of k-algebras
φ : H(V) →k[Γ]
such that
E ≃k[Γ]⊗φ ˜V
as right A-modules.
(ii): The set of equivalence classes of iterated extensions of V with
representation graph Γ, is a quotient of the set of closed points of the aﬃne
algebraic variety
A[Γ] = Mor(H(V), k[Γ])
(iii): There is a versal family ˜V [Γ] of A-modules deﬁned on A[Γ], con-
taining as ﬁbers all the isomorphism classes of iterated extensions of V with
representation graph Γ.
Let ModV
A denote the full subcategory of ModA generated by the iter-
ated extensions of of V. As usual denote by H := H(V the formal moduli
of V, Then we have the following structure theorem, generalizing a result,
of Beilinson,
Theorem 3.3.2. Let A be any k-algebra, and ﬁx a swarm, V = {Vi}r
i=1,
of A-modules, then there exists a functor,
κ : ModH(V) →ModV
A
which is an isomorphism on equivalence-classes of objects, and monomor-
phic on morphisms. If V consists of simple modules, then κ is an equiva-
lence.

32
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Proof.
Any right H(V)-module M, is a kr-module, so it can be decom-
posed as, M = ⊕Mi, where Mi := Mei. The structure map is therefore
given as,
ρ0 : H(V) →Endk(M) = (Homk(Mi, Mj)).
Here, ρ0 maps Hi,j into Homk(Mi, Mj), and therefore the formal family
may be decomposed to give us the following k-algebra homomorphisms,
ρ : A →(Hi,j ⊗Homk(Vi, Vj)) →(Homk(Mi, Mj) ⊗k Homk(Vi, Vj))
= (Homk(Mi ⊗k Vi, Mj ⊗Vj)) = Endk(W).
Here W = ⊕r
i=1(Mi ⊗Vi), and κ(M) := W.
Since k[Γ] ⊂Endk(P),
where P is k[Γ], as k[Γ]-module, the ﬁrst part of the theorem follows from
Proposition (3.3.1). The rest is more or less evident.
□
Notice that in the literature one ﬁnds the notions cluster and mutations,
both closely related to iterated extensions of modules over quivers, or as we
termed it, presheaves deﬁned on partially ordered sets, and categories, see
e.g. [13].
3.4
Non-commutative Schemes
To any, not necessarily ﬁnite, swarm c ⊂mod(A) of right-A-modules, we
may use the above O-construction, to associated to c a k-algebra, see [17]
and [18],
O(c, π) = lim
←−
c0⊂|c|
O(SVA),
where S = k[c0], is the k-algebra of the quiver associated to c0, where
{Vi}r
i=1 = |c0|, and where V := ⊕r
i Vi. There is a natural k-algebra homo-
morphism,
η(c) : A −→O(c)
with the property that the A-module structure on c is extended to an
O-module structure in an optimal way. We then deﬁned an aﬃne non-
commutative scheme of right A-modules to be a swarm c of right A-modules,
such that η(c) is an isomorphism. In particular we considered, for ﬁnitely
generated k-algebras, the swarm Simp∗
<∞(A) consisting of the ﬁnite di-
mensional simple A-modules, and the generic point A, together with all
morphisms between them. The fact that this is a swarm, i.e. that for all
objects Vi, Vj ∈Simp<∞we have dimkExt1
A(Vi, Vj) < ∞, is easily proved.

Deformations and Moduli Spaces
33
For geometric k-algebras, see [18], we have proved the following result, see
(4.1), loc.cit.,
Theorem 3.4.1. Let A be a geometric k-algebra, then the natural homo-
morphism,
η(Simp∗(A)) : A −→Oπ(Simp∗
<∞(A))
is an isomorphism, i.e. Simp∗
<∞(A) is a scheme for A.
In particular, the moduli space, Simp∗
<∞(k < x1, x2, ..., xd >), is a scheme
for k < x1, x2, ..., xd >.
To analyze the local structure of Simpn(A), we need the following, see
[18], (3.23),
Lemma 3.4.2. Let V = {Vi}i=1,..,r be a ﬁnite subset of Simp<∞(A), then
the morphism of k-algebras,
A →O(V) = (Hi,j ⊗k Homk(Vi, Vj))
is topologically surjective.
Proof.
Since the simple modules Vi, i = 1, .., r are distinct, there is
an obvious surjection, η0 : A →Q
i=1,..,r Endk(Vi). Put r = kerη0, and
consider for m ≥2 the ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebra, B := A/rm. Clearly
Simp(B) = V, so that by the generalized Burnside theorem, see [16], (2.6),
we ﬁnd, B ≃OB(V) := (HB
i,j ⊗k Homk(Vi, Vj)). Consider the commutative
diagram,

maps into OA(V)/radm, and therefore induces the morphism α commuting
with the rest of the morphisms. Consequently α has to be surjective, and
we have proved the contention.

3.4.1
Localization, Topology and the Scheme Structure on
Simp(A)
Let s ∈A, and consider the subset D(s) = {V ∈Simp(A)|ρ(s)−1 ∈
Endk(V )} of Simp(A).

34
Geometry of Time-Spaces
The Jacobson topology on Simp(A) is the topology with basis
{D(s)| s ∈A}. It is clear that the natural morphism,
η : A →O(D(s), π)
maps s into an invertible element of O(D(s), π). Therefore we may deﬁne
the localization A{s} of A, as the k-algebra generated in O(D(s), π) by im η
and the inverse of η(s). This furnishes a general method of localization with
all the properties one would wish. And in this way we also ﬁnd a canonical
(pre)sheaf, O deﬁned on Simp(A).
Deﬁnition 3.4.3. When the k-algebra A is geometric, such that Simp∗(A)
is a scheme for A, we shall refer to the presheaf O, deﬁned above on the
Jacobson topology, as the structure presheaf of the scheme Simp(A).
We shall now see that the Jacobson topology on Simp(A), restricted to
each Simpn(A) is the Zariski topology for a classical scheme-structure.
Recall ﬁrst that a standard n-commutator relation in a k-algebra A is a
relation of the type,
[a1, a2, ..., a2n] :=
X
σ∈Σ2n
sign(σ)aσ(1)aσ(2)...aσ(2n) = 0
where {a1, a2, ..., a2n} is a subset of A. Let I(n) be the two-sided ideal of
A generated by the subset,
{[a1, a2, ..., a2n]| {a1, a2, ..., a2n} ⊂A}.
Consider the canonical homomorphism,
pn : A −→A/I(n) =: A(n).
It is well known that any homomorphism of k-algebras,
ρ : A −→Endk(kn) =: Mn(k)
factors through pn, see e.g. [4].
Corollary 3.4.4. (i). Let Vi, Vj ∈Simp≤n(A) and put r = mVi ∩mVj.
Then we have, for m ≥2,
Ext1
A(Vi, Vj) ≃Ext1
A/rm(Vi, Vj)
(ii). Let V ∈Simpn(A). Then,
Ext1
A(V, V ) ≃Ext1
A(n)(V, V )

Deformations and Moduli Spaces
35
Proof.
(i) follows directly from Lemma (3.4.2). To see (ii), notice that
Ext1
A(V, V ) ≃Derk(A, Endk(V ))/Triv ≃Derk(A(n), Endk(V ))/Triv ≃
Ext1
A(n)(V, V ).
The second isomorphism follows from the fact that any
derivation maps a standard n-commutator relation into a sum of standard
n-commutator relations.
□
Example 3.1. Notice that, for distinct Vi, Vj ∈Simp≤n(A), we may well
have,
Ext1
A(Vi, Vj) ̸= Ext1
A(n)(Vi, Vj).
In fact, consider the matrix k-algebra,
A =
k[x] k[x]
0
k[x]

,
and let n = 1. Then A(1) = k[x] ⊕k[x]. Put V1 = k[x]/(x) ⊕(0), V2 =
(0) ⊕k[x]/(x), then it is easy to see that,
Ext1
A(Vi, Vj) = k, Ext1
A(1)(Vi, Vj) = 0, i ̸= j,
but,
Ext1
A(Vi, Vi) = Ext1
A(1)(Vi, Vi) = k, i = 1, 2.
Lemma 3.4.5. Let B be a k-algebra, and let V be a vector space of di-
mension n, such that the k-algebra B ⊗Endk(V ) satisﬁes the standard
n-commutator-relations, i.e. such that the ideal, I(n) ⊂B ⊗Endk(V ) gen-
erated by the standard n-commutators [x1, x2, .., x2n], xi ∈B ⊗Endk(V ),
is zero. Then B is commutative.
Proof.
In fact, if b1, b2 ∈B is such that [b1, b2] ̸= 0, then the obvious
n-commutator,
(b1e1,1)(b2e1,1)e1,2e2,2...en−1,n.en,n −(b2e1,1)(b1e1,1)e1,2e2,2...en−1,n.en,n
is diﬀerent from 0. Here ei,j is the n × n matrix with all elements equal to
0, except the one in the (i, j) position, where the element is equal to 1. □
Lemma 3.4.6. If A is a ﬁnite type k-algebra, then any V ∈Simpn(A) is
an A(n)-module. Let V ⊂Simpn(A) be a ﬁnite family, then HA(n)(V) is
commutative. In particular,
• ExtA(n)(Vi, Vj) = 0, for Vi ̸= Vj
• HA(n)(V ) ≃HA(V )com := H(V )/[H(V ), H(V )].

36
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Proof.
Since
A(n) →O(V) ≃Mn(HA(n)(V))
is topologically surjective, we ﬁnd using (Lemma 3.4.9), that H A(n)(V) is
commutative. This implies (1) and the commutativity of HA(n)(V ). Con-

The existence of α is a conse-
quence of the ideal I(n) of A mapping to zero in H(V )com ⊗k Endk(V ) ≃
Mn(H(V )com). Therefore there are natural morphisms of formal moduli,
HA(V ) →HA(n)(V ) →HA(V )com →HA(n)(V )com.
Since HA(n)(V ) = HA(n)(V )com the composition,
HA(n)(V ) →HA(V )com →HA(n)(V )com,
must be an isomorphism. Since, by Corollary (3.4.4), the tangent spaces of
HA(n)(V ) and HA(V ) are isomorphic, the lemma is proved.
□
Corollary 3.4.7. Let A = k < x1, .., xd > be the free k-algebra on d sym-
bols, and let V ∈Simpn(A). Then
HA(V )com ≃HA(n)(V ) ≃k[[t1, ..., t(d−1)n2+1]]
This should be compared with the results of [24], see also [4].
In general, the natural morphism,

generated by the elements {xi
p,q}i=1,..,d; p,q=1,..,n is commutative. We have
an injection,
O(n) →Mn(C(n)),
and for all V ∈Simpn(A), with a chosen basis, there is a natural compo-
sition of homomorphisms of k-algebras,
α : Mn(C(n)) →Mn(HA(n)(V )) →Endk(V ),
inducing a corresponding composition of homomorphisms of the centers,
Z(α) : C(n) →HA(n)(V ) →k
This sets up a set theoretical injective map,
t : Simpn(A) −→Max(C(n)),
deﬁned by t(V ) := kerZ(α).

Since A(n)
→
HA(n)(V ) ⊗k Endk(V ) is topologically surjective,
HA(n)(V ) ⊗k Endk(V ) is topologically generated by the images of xi, i =
1, ..., d. It follows that we have a surjective homomorphism,
ˆC(n)t(V ) →HA(n)(V ).
Categorical properties implies, that there is another natural morphism,
HA(n)(V ) →ˆC(n)t(V ),
which composed with the former is an automorphism of HA(n)(V ). Since
Mn(C(n)) ⊆
Y
V ∈Simpn(A)
HA(n)(V ) ⊗k Endk(V ),
it follows that for mv ∈Max(C(n)), corresponding to V ∈Simpn(A),
the ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra Mn(C(n)/mv2) sits in a ﬁnite dimensional
quotient of some,
Y
V ∈V
HA(n)(V ) ⊗k Endk(V ).
where V ⊂Simpn(A) is ﬁnite. However, by Lemma (2.5), the morphism,
A(n) −→
Y
V ∈V
HA(n)(V ) ⊗k Endk(V )
is topologically surjectiv. Therefore the morphism,
A(n) −→Mn(C(n)/mv2)
is surjectiv, implying that the map
HA(n)(V ) →ˆC(n)mv,
is surjectiv, and consequently, HA(n)(V ) ≃ˆC(n)mv.
We now have the following theorem, see Chapter VIII, §2, of the book
[25], where part of this theorem is proved.
Theorem 3.4.8. Let V
∈Simpn(A), correspond to the point mv ∈
Simp1(C(n)).
(i) There exist a Zariski neighborhood Uv of v in Simp1(C(n)) such that
any closed point m′
v ∈U corresponds to a unique point V ′ ∈Simpn(A).
Let U(n) be the open subset of Simp1(C(n)), the union of all Uv for
V ∈Simpn(A).
(ii) O(n) deﬁnes a non-commutative structure sheaf O(n) := OU(n) of
Azumaya algebras on the topological space U(n) (Jacobson topology).
(iii) The center S(n) of O(n), deﬁnes a scheme structure on Simpn(A).

(iv) The versal family of n-dimensional simple modules, ˜V := C(n)⊗kV ,
over Simpn(A), is deﬁned by the morphism,
˜ρ : A →O(n) ⊆EndC(n)(C(n)) ⊗k V ) ≃Mn(C(n)).
(v) The trace ring Tr˜ρ ⊆S(n) ⊆C(n) deﬁnes a commutative aﬃne
scheme structure on Simpn(A). Moreover, there is a morphism of schemes,
κ : U(n) −→Simpn(A),
such that for any v ∈U(n),
HA(n)(V ) ≃ˆS(n)κ(v) ≃( ˆ
Tr˜ρ)κ(v) ≃ˆC(n)v
Proof.
Let ρ : A −→Endk(V ) be the surjective homomorphism of k-
algebras, deﬁning V ∈Simpn(A). Let, as above ei,j ∈Endk(V ) be the
elementary matrices, and pick yi,j ∈A such that ρ(yi,j) = ei,j. Let us
denote by σ the cyclical permutation of the integers {1, 2, ..., n}, and put,
sk : = [yσk(1),σk(2), yσk(2),σk(2), yσk(2),σk(3)...yσk(n),σk(n)],
s : =
X
k=0,1,..,n−1
sk ∈A.
Clearly, s ∈I(n −1).
Since [eσk(1),σk(2), eσk(2),σk(2), eσk(2),σk(3)...eσk(n),σk(n)] = eσk(1),σk(n) ∈
Endk(V ), ρ(s) := P
k=0,1,..,n−1 ρ(sk) ∈Endk(V ) is the matrix with non-
zero elements, equal to 1, only in the (σk(1), σk(n)) position, so the de-
terminant of ρ(s) must be +1 or -1. The determinant det(s) ∈C(n) is
therefore nonzero at the point v ∈Spec(C(n)) corresponding to V . Put
U = D(det(s)) ⊂Spec(C(n)), and consider the localization O(n){s} ⊆
Mn(C(n){det(s)}), the inclusion following from general properties of the lo-
calization. Now, any closed point v′ ∈U corresponds to a n-dimensional
representation of A, for which the element s ∈I(n −1) is invertible. But
then this representation cannot have a m < n dimensional quotient, so it
must be simple.
Since s ∈I(n−1), the localized k-algebra O(n){s} does not have any sim-
ple modules of dimension less than n, and no simple modules of dimension
> n . In fact, for any ﬁnite dimensional O(n){s}-module V , of dimension m,
the image ˆs of s in Endk(V ) must be invertible. However, the inverse ˆs−1
must be the image of a polynomial (of degree m−1) in s. Therefore, if V is
simple over O(n){s}, i.e. if the homomorphism O(n){s} →Endk(V ) is sur-
jective, V must also be simple over A. Since now s ∈I(n−1), it follows that

40
Geometry of Time-Spaces
m ≥n. If m > n, we may construct, in the same way as above an element
in I(n) mapping into a nonzero element of Endk(V ). Since, by construc-
tion, I(n) = 0 in A(n), and therefore also in O(n){s}, we have proved what
we wanted. By a theorem of M. Artin, see [1], O(n){s} must be an Azu-
maya algebra with center, S(n){s} := Z(O(n){s}). Therefore O(n) deﬁnes a
presheaf O(n) on U(n), of Azumaya algebras with center S(n) := Z(O(n)).
Clearly, any V ∈Simpn(A), corresponding to mv ∈Max(C(n)) maps to a
point κ(v) ∈Simp(O(n)). Let mκ(v) be the corresponding maximal ideal
of S(n). Since O(n) is locally Azumaya, it follows that,
ˆS(n)mκ(v) ≃HO(n)(V ) ≃HA(n)(V ).
The rest is clear.

Spec(C(n)) is, in a sense, a compactiﬁcation of Simpn(A). It is, how-
ever, not the correct completion of Simpn(A).
In fact, the points of
Spec(C(n)) −Simpn(A) may correspond to semi-simple modules, which
do not deform into simple n-dimensional modules. We shall return to the
study of the (notion of) completion, together with the degeneration pro-
cesses that occur, at inﬁnity in Simpn(A).
Example 3.3. Let us check the case of A = k < x1, x2 >, the free
non-commutative k-algebra on two symbols.
First, we shall compute
Ext1
A(V, V ) for a particular V ∈Simp2(A), and ﬁnd a basis {t∗
i }5
i=1, repre-
sented by derivations ∂i := ∂i(V ) ∈Derk(A, Endk(V )), i=1,2,3,4,5. This
is easy, since for any two A-modules V1, V2, we have the exact sequence,
0 →HomA(V1, V2) →Homk(V1, V2) →Derk(A, Homk(V1, V2))
→Ext1
A(V1, V2) →0
proving that, Ext1
A(V1, V2) = Derk(A, Homk(V1, V2))/Triv, where Triv is
the sub-vector space of trivial derivations.
Pick V ∈Simp2(A) deﬁned
by the homomorphism A →M2(k) mapping the generators x1, x2 to the
matrices
X1 :=
0 1

=: e2,2 = e2,
and recall also that for any 2×2-matrix (ap,q) ∈M2(k), ei(ap,q)ej = ai,jei,j.
The trivial derivations are generated by the derivations {δp,q}p,q=1.2, de-
ﬁned by,
δp,q(xi) = Xiep,q −ep,qXi.

Clearly δ1,1+δ2,2 = 0. Now, compute and show that the derivations ∂i, i =

∂i(x1) = 0, for i = 1, 2, ∂i(x2) = 0, for i = 4, 5,
by,
∂1(x2) = e1,1, ∂2(x2) = e1,2, ∂3(x1) = e1,2, ∂4(x1) = e2,2, ∂5(x1) = e2,1
and by,
∂3(x2) = e2,1,
form
a
basis
for
Ext1
A(V, V )
=
Derk(A, Endk(V ))/Triv.
Since
Ext2
A(V, V ) = 0 we ﬁnd H(V ) = k << t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 >> and so
H(V )com ≃k[[t1, t2, t3, t4, t5]]. The formal versal family ˜V , is deﬁned by
the actions of x1, x2, given by,
X1 :=
 0 1 + t3
t5
t4

, X2 :=

t1

.
One checks that there are polynomials of X1, X2 which are equal to tiep,q,
modulo the ideal (t1, .., t5)2 ⊂H(V ), for all i, p, q = 1, 2. This proves that
ˆC(2)v must be isomorphic to H(V ), and that the composition,
A −→A(2) −→M2(C(2)) ⊂M2(H(V )))
is topologically surjective. By the construction of C(n) this also proves that
C(2) ≃k[t1, t2, t3, t4, t5].
locally in a Zariski neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, the Formanek
center, see [4], in this case is cut out by the single equation:
f := det[X1, X2] = −((1+t3)2 −t2t5)2 +(t1(1+t3)+t2t4)(t4(1+t3)+t1t5).
Computing, we also ﬁnd the following formulas,
trX1 = t4, trX2 = t1,
detX1 = −t5 −t3t5, detX2 = −t2 −t2t3,
tr(X1X2) = (1 + t3)2 + t2t5
so the trace ring of this family is
k[t1, t2 + t2t3, 1 + 2t3 + t2
3 + t2t5, t4, t5 + t3t5] =: k[u1, u2, ..., u5],
with,
u1 = t1, u2 = (1 + t3)t2, u3 = (1 + t3)2 + t2t5, u4 = t4, u5 = (1 + t3)t5,
and f = −u2
3+4u2u5+u1u3u4+u2
1u5+u2u2
4. Moreover, the k[t] is algebraic
over k[u], with discriminant, ∆:= 4u2u5(u2
3 −4u2u5) = 4(1 + t3)2t2t5((1 +
t3)2 −t2t5)2. From this follows that there is an ´etale covering
A5 −V (f∆) →Simp2(A) −V (∆).
Notice that if we put t1 = t4 = 0, then f = ∆. See the Example (3.7)

3.4.2
Completions of Simpn(A)
In the example above it is easy to see that elements of the complement
of U(n) in the aﬃne scheme Spec(C(n)) will be represented by indecom-
posable, or decomposable representations. A decomposable representation
W will, however, not in general be deformable into a simple representa-
tion, since good deformations must conserve EndA(W). Therefore, even
though we have termed Spec(C(n)) a compactiﬁcation of Simpn(A), it is
a bad completion.
The missing points at inﬁnity
of Simpn(A), should
be represented as indecomposable representations, with EndA(W) = k.
Any such is an iterated extension of simple representations {Vi}i=1,2,..s,
with representation graph Γ (corresponding to an extension type, see
[18]), and Ps
i=1 dim(Vi) = n. To simplify the notations we shall write,
|Γ| := {Vi}i=1,2,..s. In [16], we treat the problem of classifying all such in-
decomposable representations, up to isomorphisms. Let us recall the main
ideas.
Assume given a family of modules {Vi} such that all Ext1
A(Vi, Vj) are
ﬁnite dimensional as k-vector spaces. Let Γ be an ordered graph with set
of nodes |Γ| = {Vi}. Starting with a ﬁrst node of Γ, we can construct, in
many ways, an extension of the corresponding module Vi1 with the module
Vi2 corresponding to the end point of the ﬁrst arrow of Γ, then continue,
choosing an extension of the result with the module corresponding to the
endpoint of the second arrow of Γ, etc. untill we have reached the endpoint
of the last arrow.
Any ﬁnite length module can be made in this way,
the oppositely ordered Γ corresponding to a decomposition of the module
into simple constituencies, by peeling oﬀone simple sub-module at a time,
i.e. by picking one simple sub-module and forming the quotient, picking
a second simple sub-module of the quotient and taking the quotient, and
repeating the procedure until it stops.
The ordered k-algebra k[Γ] of the ordered graph Γ is the quotient
algebra of the usual algebra of the graph Γ by the ideal generated by
all admissible words which are not intervals of the ordered graph.
Say
...γi,j(n −1)γj,j(n)γj,k(n + 1)... is is an interval of the ordered graph, then
γi,j(n −1).γj,k(n + 1) = 0 in k[Γ].
Now, let H(|Γ|) be the formal moduli of the family |Γ|. We show in [18],
see Proposition 2. above, that any iterated extension of the {Vi}r
i=1 with
extension type, i.e. graph, Γ corresponds to a morphism in ar,
α : H −→k[Γ].
Moreover the set of isomorphism classes of such modules is parametrized

Deformations and Moduli Spaces
43
by a quotient space of the aﬃne scheme,
A(Γ) := Morar(H(|Γ|), k[Γ]).
Let α ∈A(Γ), and let V (α) denote the corresponding iterated extension
module, then the tangent space of A(Γ) at α is,
TA(Γ),α := Derk(H(|Γ|), k[Γ]α),
where k[Γ]α is k[Γ] considered as a H(|Γ|)-bimodule via α. The obstruction
space for the deformation functor of α is HH2(H(|Γ|), k[Γ]), and we may,
as is explained in [14], [15], compute the complete local ring of A(Γ) at α.
In particular we may decide whether the point is a smooth point of A(Γ),
or not.
The automorphism group G of k[Γ], considered as an object of ar, has
a Lie algebra which we shall call g. Obviously we have,
g = Derk(k[Γ], k[Γ]).
Clearly an iterated extension α with graph Γ will be isomorphic as A-
module to g(α), for any g ∈G. In particular, if δ ∈g, then exp(δ)(α)
is isomorphic to α as an iterated extension of A-modules, with the same
graph as α.
Consider the map,
α∗: Derk(k[Γ], k[Γ]) →Derk(H(Γ), k[Γ]α).
The image of α∗is the subspace of the tangent space of A(Γ) at α along
which the corresponding module has constant isomorphism class.
Notice that if α is a smooth point, and α∗is not surjectiv then there
is a positive-dimensional moduli space of iterated extension modules with
graph Γ through α.
The kernel of α∗is contained in the Lie algebra of automorphisms of the
module V (α), and should be contained in EndA(V (α)). From this follows
that if V (α) is indecomposable then kerα∗= 0. The Euler type derivations,
deﬁned by,
δE(γi,j) = ρi,jγi,j, ρi,j ∈k
are the easiest to check! Notice however, that there may be discrete auto-
morphisms in G, not of exponential type, leaving α invariant. Notice also
that an indecomposable module may have an endomorphism ring which is
a non-trivial local ring.
Assume now that we have identiﬁed the non-commutative scheme of
indecomposable Γ-representation, call it IndΓ(A).
Put SimpΓ(A) :=

44
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Simpn(A) ∪IndΓ(A).
Now, repeat the basics of the construction of
Spec(C(n)) above.
Consider for every open aﬃne subscheme D(s) ⊂
SimpΓ(A), the natural morphism,
A →
lim
←−
c⊂D(s)
O(c, π)
c
running
through
all
ﬁnite
subsets
of
D(s).
Put
Bs(Γ)
:=
Q
V ∈D(s) HA(n)(V )com, and consider the homomorphism,
A →A(n) →
Y
V ∈D(s)
HA(n)(V )com ⊗k Endk(V ) ≃Mn(Bs(Γ)).
Let xi ∈A, i = 1, ..., d be generators of A, and consider the images (xi
p,q) ∈
Bs(n) ⊗k Endk(kn) of xi via the homomorphism of k-algebras,
A →Bs(Γ) ⊗Mn(k),
obtained by choosing bases in all V ∈SimpΓ(A). Notice that since V no
longer is (necessarily) simple, we do not know that this map is topologically
surjectiv.
Now, Bs(Γ) is commutative, so the k-sub-algebra Cs(Γ) ⊂Bs(Γ) gen-
erated by the elements {xi
p,q}i=1,..,d; p,q=1,..,n is commutative. We have a
morphism,
Is(Γ) : A →Cs(Γ) ⊗k Mn(k) = Mn(Cs(Γ)).
Moreover, these Cs(Γ) deﬁne a presheaf, C(Γ), on the Jacobson topol-
ogy of SimpΓ(A).
The rank n free Cs(Γ)-modules with the A-actions
given by Is(Γ), glue together to form a locally free C(Γ)-Module E(Γ)
on SimpΓ(A), and the morphisms Is(Γ) induce a morphism of algebras,
I(Γ) : A →EndC(Γ)(E(Γ)).
As for every V ∈SimpΓ(A), EndA(V ) = k, the commutator of A in
HA(V )com ⊗k Endk(V ) is HA(V )com. The morphism,
ζ(V ) : HA(V )com →HH0(A, HA(V )com ⊗k Endk(V ))
is therefore an isomorphism, and we may assume that the corresponding
morphism,
ζ : C(Γ) →HH0(A, EndC(Γ)(E(Γ)))
is an isomorphism of sheaves.
For all V ∈D(s) ⊂SimpΓ(A) there is a natural projection,
κ := κ(Γ) : Cs(Γ)⊗kMn(k) →HA(n)(V )com⊗kEndk(V ) ≃Mn(HA(n)(V )com),

Deformations and Moduli Spaces
45
which, composed with Is(Γ) is the natural homomorphism,
A −→HA(n)(V )com ⊗k Endk(V ).
κ deﬁnes a set theoretical map,
t : SimpΓ(A) −→Spec(C(Γ)),
and a natural surjective homomorphism,
ˆC(Γ)t(V ) →HA(n)(V )com.
Categorical properties implies, as usual, that there is another natural mor-
phism,
ι : HA(n)(V ) →ˆC(Γ)t(V ),
which composed with the former is the obvious surjection, and such that
the induced composition,
A −→HA(n)(V )com ⊗k Endk(V ) →ˆC(Γ)t(V ) ⊗k Endk(V ),
is I(Γ) formalized at t(V ). From this, and from the deﬁnition of C(Γ), it
follows that ι is surjective, such that for every V ∈SimpΓ(A) there is an
isomorphism HA(n)(V )com ≃ˆC(Γ)t(V ).
This implies that, formally at a point V ∈SimpΓ(A), the local, commu-
tative structure of SimpΓ(A) (as A or A(n)-module), and the corresponding
local structure of Spec(C(Γ)) at V , coincide. We have actually proved the
following,
Theorem 3.4.9. The topological space SimpΓ(A), with the Jacobson topol-
ogy, together with the sheaf of commutative k-algebras C(Γ) deﬁnes a
scheme structure on SimpΓ(A), containing an open subscheme, ´etale over
Simpn(A). Moreover, there is a morphism,
π(Γ) : SimpΓ(A) →Spec(ZA(n)),
extending the natural morphism,
π0 : Simpn(A) →Spec(ZA(n)).
Proof.
As in Theorem (3.4.8) we prove that if v = t(V ), with V
∈
Simpn(A)
⊆
SimpΓ(A),
then there exists an open subscheme of
Spec(C(Γ)) containing only simple modules of dimension n.
If v is in-
decomposables with EndA(V ) = k we may look at the homomorphism of
C(Γ)-modules,
EndA(C(Γ)) ⊗Endk(V ) −→EndA(V ) = k.
Clearly there is an open neighborhood of v in Spec(C(Γ)) containing only
indecomposables of dimension n.
□

46
Geometry of Time-Spaces
These morphisms π(Γ) are our candidates for the possibly diﬀerent com-
pletions of Simpn(A). Notice that for W ∈Spec(C(n)) −U(n), the formal
moduli HA(W) is not always pro-representing. If W is semi-simple, but
not simple then EndA(W) ̸= k. The corresponding modular substratum
will, locally, correspond to the semi-simple deformations of W, thus to a
closed subscheme of Spec(C(n)) −U(n) ⊂Spec(C(n)). This follows from
the fact that the substratum of modular deformations of any semisimple
(but not simple) module V will have a tangent space equal to the invariant
space of the action of the Endk(V ) on Ext1
A(V, V ), which must be the sum
of the tangent spaces of the deformation spaces of the simple components
of V .
As we have already remarked, Spec(C(n)) is, in a sense, a compactiﬁ-
cation of U(n). It is, however not the correct completion of U(n). In fact,
the points of Spec(C(n)) −U(n) may correspond to semi-simple modules,
which do not deform into simple n-dimensional modules. We shall in the
last chapter return to the study of the (notion of) completion, in connection
with the process of decay and creation of particles. Decay occur, at inﬁnity
in Simpn(A), see the Introduction.
3.5
Morphisms, Hilbert Schemes, Fields and Strings
Above we have studied moduli spaces of representations of ﬁnitely gener-
ated k-algebras. We might as well have studied the Hilbert functor, HAr,
of subschemes of length r of the spectrum of the algebra A, or the moduli
space F(A; R), of morphisms, κ : A →R, for ﬁxed algebras, A and R.
The diﬀerence is that whereas for ﬁnite n, the set Simpn(A) has a nice,
ﬁnite dimensional scheme structure, this is, in general, no longer true for
the set, Hr
A nor for the set of ﬁelds, F(A; R), as the physicists call it, unless
we put some extra conditions on the ﬁelds, so called decorations. If R is
Artinian of length n, then the corresponding F(A; R) does exist and has
a nice structure, both as commutative and as non-commutative scheme.
The toy model of relativity theory, referred to in the introduction, is in
fact modeled on M(k[x1, x2, x3], k2), i.e. on the set of surjective homomor-
phisms k[x1, x2, x3] →R = k2. And, in all generality, the space F(A; R)
has a tangent structure. I fact, depending on the point of view, the tangent
space of a morphism φ : A →R is equal to,
TF(A;R),φ = Derk(A, R)/Triv,

Deformations and Moduli Spaces
47
where Triv either is 0 or the inner derivations induced by R. Even though
there is no obvious algebraic structure on F(A; R) this general situation is
important. It is the basis of our treatment of Quantum Field Theory, as
we shall see, in the next chapter. There it will be treated in combination
with the notion of clock.
We may also consider the notion of string, in the same language as
above. Let us, for the fun of it, make the following :
Deﬁnition 3.5.1. A general string, or a g-string, is an algebra R together
with a pair of Ph-points, i.e. a pair of homomorphisms ϵi : Ph(R) →k(pi),
corresponding to two points k(pi) ∈Simp1(R) each outﬁtted with a tangent
ξi.
We might have considered any two points k(pi) ∈Simpn(Ph(R)), but
since the main properties of the g-strings will be equally well understood
restricting to the case n = 1, we shall postpone this generalization. For
any g-string, consider the non-commutative tangent space of the the pair of
points,
T(R, p1, p2) := Ext1
P hR(p1, p2).
We shall call it the space of tensions, between the two points of the string.
Consider the space Stringg(A) of g −strings in A, i.e. the space of isomor-
phism classes of algebra homomorphisms κ : A →R where R is a g-string,
and where isomorphisms should correspond to isomorphisms of the g-string,
thus conserving the two PhR-points. Any g-string in A, κ : A →R, induces
a unique commutative diagram of algebras, The von Neumann condition
imposed on a string κ, is now the following,
ϵi ◦Phκ ◦d = κ∗ξi =: ξi = 0, i = 1 ∨i = 2,
which, if xj, j = 1, .., n and σl, l = 1, .., p are parameters of A respectively
R, is equivalent to the condition,
∂xj
∂σ l(pi) = 0, j = 1, ..., n, l = 1, .., p, i = 1 ∨2.
Notice also that, since any derivation ξ ∈Derk(A, R) has a natural
lifting to a derivation ξ ∈Derk(PhA, PhR) deﬁned by simply putting
ξ(a) = d(ξ(a)), we ﬁnd, using the general machinery of deformations
of diagrams, see [14], that any family of morphisms κ induces a fam-
ily of the above diagram.
If τk, k = 1, ..., d are parameters of such a
family, M = Spec(M), then dτi ∈PhM corresponds to a derivation,

48

τi ∈Derk(A, R), and therefore to tangents ξi, i = 1, 2, of Simp1(A) at
the two points k(pi). The Dirichlet condition on the string is now,
ξi = 0, i = 1 ∨2,
which is equivalent to the condition,
∂xj
∂τl
(pi) = 0, j = 1, ..., n, l = 1, .., p, i = 1 ∨2.
These conditions will deﬁne new moduli spaces which we shall call
StringvN
R (A) and StringD
R (A), respectively. In the aﬃne case the struc-
ture of these spaces is a problem, however we may of course do everything
above for A and R replaced by projective schemes, and then all the moduli
spaces exist as classical schemes. The volume form of the space the string
is fanning out will give us a an action functional, S, deﬁned on StringR(A),
see next chapter.
Let us end this sketch by noticing that there is a non-commutative
deformation theory for ﬁelds, just as there is one for representations of
associative algebras. In fact, let {κi}i=1,..,r be a ﬁnite family of ﬁelds, and
consider for every pair (i, j)|1 ≤i, j ≤r the A-bimodule Ri,j where κi
deﬁnes the left module structure, and κj the right hand structure. Then
copying the deﬁnition for the non-commutative deformation functor for
representations, replacing Homk(Vi, Vj) by Ri,j, we may prove most of the
results referred to at the beginning of this chapter. This may be of interest
in relation with the problems of interactions treated in the last chapter of
this book.
Example 3.4. (i) Let us go back to Example (1.1)(ii). It follows that the
string of dimension 0, R = k2, Ph(R) = k < x, dx > /((x2 −r2), (xdx +
dxx)), has unique points, k(±r). The space of tensions is of dimension 1, the
von Neumann condition is automatically satisﬁed, and the moduli space of
k2-strings in A = k[x1, x2, x3] is nothing but H := Speck[t1, ..., t6]−∆. If we
consider the string with R = k[x]/(x2), PhR = k[x, dx]/(x2, (xdx + dxx),
then we see that there is just one point of R, but a line of point for PhR,
all corresponding to x = 0 in R. Therefore there is a 2-dimensional space
of strings with the same R. Compare this with the blow-up ˜H, see [20]. (ii)
In dimension 1 the simplest closed string is given by, R = k[x, y]/(f), with
f = x2 + y2 −r2, such that PhR = k < x, y, dx, dy > /(f, [x, y], d[x, y], df),
and with the two points, ϵi : PhR →k(pi), deﬁned by the actions on
k(pi) := k, given by, xi, yi, (dx)i, (dy)i, i = 1, 2. It is easy to see that
the vectors, ξi := ((dx)i, (dy)i) are tangent vectors to the circle at the

Deformations and Moduli Spaces
49
points pi, and if p1 ̸= p2 we ﬁnd that Ext1
P hR(k(p1), k(p2) = k. The von
Neumann condition is, ξi = 0, i = 1 ∨i = 2, and this clearly means that
∂x
∂σ = ∂y
∂σ = 0 at one of the points pi. The 1-dimensional open string is now
left as an exercise.

Chapter 4
Geometry of Time-spaces and the
General Dynamical Law
Given a ﬁnitely generated k-algebra, and a natural number n, we have in
Chapter 3 constructed a scheme Simpn(A), and a versal family,
˜ρ : A →EndU(n)( ˜V )
deﬁned on an ´etale covering U(n) of Simpn(A). U(n) is an open subscheme
of an aﬃne scheme Spec(C(n)), and the versal family is, in fact, deﬁned on
C(n).
4.1
Dynamical Structures
We would now like to use this theory for the k-algebra Ph∞(A) of Chapter
2. However, Ph∞(A) is rarely of ﬁnite type. We shall therefore intoduce
the notion of dynamical structure, and the order of a dynamical structure,
to reduce the problem to a situation we can handle. This is also what physi-
cists do, they invoke a parsimony principle, or an action principle, originally
proposed by Fermat, and later by Maupertuis, with exactely this purpose,
reducing the preparation needed to be able to see ahead, see Chapter 2.
Deﬁnition 4.1.1. A dynamical structure, σ, is a two-sided δ-stable ideal
(σ) ⊂Ph∞(A), such that
A(σ) := Ph∞(A)/(σ),
the corresponding, dynamical system, is of ﬁnite type. A dynamical struc-
ture, or system, is of order n if the canonical morphism,
σ : Ph(n−1)(A) →A(σ)
is surjective. If A is generated by the coordinate functions, {ti}i=1,2,...,d a
dynamical system of order n may be deﬁned by a force law, i.e. by a system
51

52
Geometry of Time-Spaces
of equations,
δntp = Γp(ti, dtj, d2tk, .., dn−1tl), p = 1, 2, ..., d.
Put,
A(σ) := Ph∞(A)/(δntp −Γp)
where σ := (δntp −Γp) is the two-sided δ-ideal generated by the deﬁning
equations of σ. Obviously δ induces a derivation δσ ∈Derk(A(σ), A(σ)),
also called the Dirac derivation, and usually just denoted δ.
Notice that if σi, i = 1, 2, are two diﬀerent order n dynamical systems,
then we may well have,
A(σ1) ≃A(σ2) ≃Ph(n−1)(A)/(σ∗),
as k-algebras, see the Introduction.
4.2
Quantum Fields and Dynamics
For any integer n ≥1 consider the schemes Simpn(A(σ)) and Spec(C(n)),
and the corresponding (almost uni-) versal family,
˜ρ : A(σ)) →EndSpec(C(n))( ˜V ) ≃Mn(C(n)).
The Dirac derivation δ ∈Derk(A(σ), A(σ)), composed with ρ, correspond-
ing to any element v ∈Simpn(A(σ)), deﬁnes, as explained in Chapter 2,
a tangent vector of Simpn(A(σ)) at the point v, thus a distribution on
Simpn(A(σ)).
The reason why the Dirac derivation, does not deﬁne a
unique vector-ﬁeld is, of course, that the structure morphisms of the simple
modules can be scaled by any non-zero element of the ﬁeld k. However,
once we have chosen a versal family for the moduli space Simpn(A(σ)), de-
ﬁned on Spec(C(n)), the Dirac derivation δ induces, by composition with
˜ρ, an element,
˜δ ∈Derk(A(σ), EndC(n)( ˜V )).
which obviously induces a well deﬁned vector ﬁeld ξ ∈ΘU(n), in the distri-
bution deﬁned by δ. Now, to any vectorﬁeld η of Spec(C(n)), i.e. for any
derivation η ∈Derk(C(n)), there is a unique element,
η′ ∈Derk(A(σ), EndC(n)( ˜V )),
deﬁned by,
η′(a) = η(˜ρ(a)),

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
53
where we have identiﬁed ˜ρ(a) with an element of Mn(C(n)). Suppose there
exist a (rational) derivation [δ] ∈Derk(C(n)), lifting the vector ﬁeld ξ
in Simpn(A(σ)), deﬁned by the Dirac derivation, then by construction of
C(n), and of the versal family ˜ρ, in general, we ﬁnd that ˜δ −[δ]′ is an inner
derivation, deﬁned by some Q ∈EndC(n)( ˜V ).
This is the situation which we shall ﬁnd ourselves in, in the sequel, see
the Examples (4.1) and (4.3).
In general, we have the fundamental result:
Theorem 4.2.1. Formally, at any point v
∈
U(n), with local ring
ˆ
C(n)v, there is a derivation [δ] ∈Derk(
ˆ
C(n)v), and an Hamiltonian
Q ∈End
ˆ
C(n)v( ˜Vv), such that, as operators on ˜Vv, we must have,
δ = [δ] + [Q, −].
This means that for every a ∈A(σ), considered as an element ˜ρ(a) ∈
Mn(
ˆ
C(n)v), δ(a) acts on ˜Vv as
˜ρ(δ(a)) = ξ(˜ρ(a)) + [Q, ˜ρ(a)].
Proof.
Suppose the family,
˜ρ : A(σ) →EndSpec(C(n))( ˜V ) ≃Mn(C(n)).
had been the universal family of a ﬁne moduli space. Then any (inﬁnitesi-
mal) automorphism of A(σ) would have been squared oﬀby an (inﬁnitesi-
mal) automorphism of EndSpec(C(n))( ˜V ) = Mn(C(n)). Given a derivation
δ of A(σ) there is an induced homomorphism, A(σ) →A(σ)⊗k k[ϵ]. Com-
posed with the natural homomorphism, A(σ) ⊗k k[ϵ] →C(n) ⊗k k[ϵ] ⊗
Endk(V ) ≃Mn(C(n) ⊗k k[ϵ]), we ﬁnd a lifting of the family, and we know
that there should exist a morphism, C(n) →C(n) ⊗k k[ϵ] deﬁning an iso-
morphic lifting. Now, this induces a derivation [δ], of C(n) plus a trivial
derivation; ad(Q), of Mn(C(n)), exactly as we want. Recall also that any
derivation of Mn(C(n)) is a sum of a derivation of C(n) plus an inner
derivation ad(Q), Q ∈Mn(C(n)). Since our space U(n) ⊂Spec(C(n)) is
an ´etale covering of the moduli space Simpn(A(σ)), and since our versal
family is only deﬁned over U(n), we need to restrict to the formal case.
Since
ˆ
C(n)v ≃ˆOSimpn(A(σ)),v this case is clear by the general deformation
theory, just like above.
□
As pointed out above, in the examples that we shall meet in the sequel,
there are local (or even global) extensions of this result, where [δ] and Q
may be assumed to be deﬁned (rationally) on C(n).

54
Geometry of Time-Spaces
This Q, the Hamiltonian of the system, is in the singular case, when
[δ] = 0, also called the Dirac operator, and sometimes denoted δ-slashed,
see e.g. [29], or other texts on Connes’ spectral tripples. In fact, a spectral
tripple is composed of a vector space like ˜V , together with a Dirac operator,
like Q, and a complexiﬁcation etc.
If [δ] = 0, it is also easy to see that what we have observed implies
that Heisenberg’s and Schr¨odinger’s way of doing quantum mechanics, are
strictly equivalent.
In line with our general philosophy, we shall consider ξ, or [δ] as mea-
suring time in Simpn(A(σ)), respectively in Spec(C(n)).
Assume for a while that k = R, the real numbers, and that our con-
structions go through, as if k were algebraically closed.
Let v(τ 0) ∈
Simpn(A(σ)) be an element, an event. Suppose there exist an integral curve
γ of ξ through v(τ0) ∈Simp1(C(n)), ending at v(τ1) ∈Simp1(C(n)), given
by the automorphisms e(τ) := exp(τξ), for τ ∈[τ0, τ1] ⊂R. The supre-
mum of τ for which the corresponding point, v(τ), of γ is in Simpn(A(σ))
should be called the lifetime of the particle. We shall see that it is relatively
easy to compute these lifetimes, when the fundamental vector ﬁeld ξ has
been computed.
This, however, is certainly not so easy, see the examples (3.4)-(3,8).
Let now ψ(τ0) ∈˜V (v0) ≃V be a (classically considered) state of our
quantum system, at the time τ0, and consider the (uni)versal family,
˜ρ : A(σ) −→EndC(n)( ˜V )
restricted to U(n) ⊆Simp1(C(n)), the ´etale covering of Simpn(A(σ)). We
shall consider A(σ) as our ring of observables.
What happens to ψ(τ0) ∈V (0) when time passes from τ0 to τ, along
γ? This is obviously a question that has to do with whether we choose to
consider the Heisenberg or the Schr¨odinger picture. In fact, if we consider
the formal ﬂow exp(tδ) deﬁned on the ring of observables, then putting,
u(τ) := exp(τ∇ξ),
where,
∇ξ := ξ + Q ∈Endk( ˜V ),
is a connection on ˜V , we obtain for every ψ ∈˜V , and every a ∈A(σ), that
the equation,
u(τ)(˜ρ(exp(−τδ)(a))(ψ)) = ˜ρ(a)(u(τ)(ψ))

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
55
holds formally, at least up to ﬁrst order. In fact, up to order one, in τ, the
left hand side is equal to
˜ρ(a)(ψ) −τ ˜ρ(δ(a))(ψ) + τξ(˜ρ(a)(ψ)) + τQ˜ρ(a)(ψ),
and the right hand side is,
˜ρ(a)(ψ) + τ ˜ρ(a)(ξ(ψ)) + τ ˜ρ(a)(Q(ψ)).
Noticing that ξ(˜ρ(a)(ψ)) = ξ(˜ρ(a))(ψ) + ˜ρ(a)(ξ(ψ)), and using (4.2.1.) we
ﬁnd that the two sides are equal.
This means that exp(τδ) keeps ˜V ﬁxed within its conjugate class, up to
ﬁrst order in τ. Thus, an element ψ ∈˜V which is ﬂat with respect to the
connection ∇ξ, above γ, has the property that,
˜ρ(δ(a))ψ = ∇ξ(˜ρ(a)(ψ)),
for all a ∈A(σ).
It is therefore reasonable to consider any ﬂat state, ψ(t) ∈˜V , as the time
development of ψ(0) ∈V (0). Clearly, the ﬂat states ψ ∈˜V , are solutions
of the diﬀerential equation,
ξ(ψ) = −Q(ψ), i.e. ∂ψ
∂τ = −Q(ψ).
which, if we accept that time is the parameter τ of the integral curve γ, is
the Schr¨odinger equation.
Notice that, in the classical quantum-theoretical case, one works with
one ﬁxed representation, corresponding to what we have called a singular
point of ξ. This implies that we are looking at a representation V with
ξ(v) = 0, and so we have no time. What we call time is then the parameter
of the one-parameter automorphism group u(τ) := exp(τQ) acting on V .
This also leads to a Schr¨odinger equation, and to the next result, proving
that ψ is completely determined, along any integral curve γ by the value
of ψ(τ0), for any τ0 ∈γ.
Theorem 4.2.2. The evolution operator u(τ0, τ1) that changes the state
ψ(τ0) ∈˜V (v0) into the state ψ(τ1) ∈˜V (v1), where τ1 −τ0 is the length
of the integral curve γ connecting the two points v0 and v1, i.e. the time
passed, is given by,
ψ(τ1) = u(τ0, τ1)(ψ(τ0)) = exp[
Z
γ
Q(τ)dτ] (ψ(τ0)),
where exp
R
γ is the non-commutative version of the ordinary action integral,
essentially deﬁned by the equation,
exp[
Z
γ
Q(τ)dt] = exp[
Z
γ2
Q(τ)dτ] ◦exp[
Z
γ1
Q(τ)dτ]
where γ is γ1 followed by γ2.

56
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Proof.
This is a well known consequence of the Schr¨odinger equation
above. In classical quantum theory one uses a chronological operator τ,
to keep track of the intermediate time-steps that, in our case, are well
deﬁned by the integral curve γ, the existence of which we assume. The
formula above is related to what the physicists call the Dyson series, see
[30], Vol I, Chap.
9, or [2], Chapitre 6.
Since we have given the real
curve γ parametrized by τ we may look at γ as a closed interval of R,
I := [0, τ]. Subdivide I into m equal intervals, [i∆τ, (i + 1)∆τ], and see
that the Schr¨odinger equation gives, formally,
ψ((i + 1)∆τ) = exp(∆τQ)(ψ(i∆τ)).
Writing out the power series in ∆τ, and summing up we ﬁnd the formula
above.
□
The problem of integrating the diﬀerential equations above, i.e. ﬁnding
algebraic geometric formulas for the integral curves of ξ = [δ], is a classical
problem, and we may use a technique already well known to Hamilton and
Jacobi. In fact, assuming that A = k[t1, ..., tn], and that σ is determined
by the following force-laws,
d2ti = Γi(t1, ..., tn, dt1, ..., dtn)
we have that,
A(σ) = Ph∞(A)/(σ), δ =
n
X
i=1
(dti
∂
∂ti
+ Γi ∂
∂dti
).
We may try to solve the equation,
δθ = 0
in the ring A(σ). Obviously the set of solutions form a sub-ring of A(σ),
the ring of invariants, and we have the following easy result,
Proposition 4.2.3. (i): Let Θ = kerδ, be the subring of invariants in
A(σ), and let ρ : A(σ) →Endk(V ) be an n-dimensional representation
for which the tangent space of Simpn(A(σ)), at V , Ext1
A(σ)(V, V ) = 0; or
suppose V corresponds to a point t ∈Simpn(A(σ)) for which ξ(t) = 0, then
any θ ∈Θ is constant in V , i.e. [Q, ρ(θ)] = 0, so that the eigenvectors of
Q are eigenvectors for θ.
(ii): Consider for any n the universal family,
˜ρ : A(σ) →EndC(n)( ˜V ).

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
57
and let θ ∈Θ, then
Trace˜ρ(θ) ∈C(n)
is constant along any integral curve of ξ in Simpn(A(σ)), i.e.
[δ](Trace˜ρ(θ)) = 0
Proof.
(i) Suppose δ(θ) = 0, and consider the dynamical equation,
δ = [δ] + [Q, −],
where we may assume [δ] = ξ. If the tangent space of V is trivial, then
obviously [δ] = 0, therefore δ(θ) = 0 implies [Q, ρ(θ)] = 0.
(ii) If δ(θ) = 0, we must have, in EndC(n)( ˜V ),
0 = Traceξ(˜ρ(θ)) + Trace[Q, ˜ρ(θ)] = Traceξ(˜ρ(θ)) = ξ(Trace˜ρ(θ)).
□
Notice that we ﬁnd the same formulas if we extend the action of A(σ)
to ˜VC := ˜V ⊗R C. This is what turns out to be the interesting case in
quantum physics. It is easy to see that if A = k[x1, ..., xd] ⊂A(σ) is a
polynomial algebra, and σ is a second order force-law, such as,
d2xi =
X
Γi
j,kdxjdxk, i, j, k = 1, 2, ..., d,
then, if we have chosen a versal family,
˜ρ : A(σ) →EndC(n)( ˜V )
for the simple n-dimensional representations, we obtain another, complex-
iﬁed, versal family,
˜ρC : A(σ) →EndC(n)( ˜VC)
with
exactly
the
same
formal
properties
by
deﬁning,
˜ρC(xi)
=
˜ρ(xi), ˜ρC(dxi) = ı˜ρ(dxi), and putting ξC = ıξ, QC = ıQ.
A section ψ of the complex bundle ˜V , a state, is now a function on
the moduli space Simpn(A(σ)), not a function on the conﬁguration space,
Simp1(A), or Simp1(A(σ)). The value ψ(v) ∈˜V (v) of ψ, at some point
v ∈Simpn(A), will also be called a state, at the event v.
EndC(n)( ˜V ) induces a complex bundle, of operators, on Simpn(A(σ)).
A section, φ of this bundle will be called a quantum ﬁeld. In particular,
any element a ∈(A(σ) will , via the versal family map ˜ρ, deﬁne a quantum
ﬁeld. The set of quantum ﬁelds therefore form a natural k-algebra.
Physicists will tend to be uncomfortable with this use of their language.
A classical quantum ﬁeld for any traditional physicist is, usually, a function
ψ(p, σ, n), deﬁned on conﬁguration space, (which is not our Simpn(A(σ)))
with values, in the polynomial algebra generated by certain creation and
annihilation operators in a Fock-space.
As we shall see, this interpretation may be viewed as a special case of
our general notion.

58
Geometry of Time-Spaces
4.3
Classical Quantum Theory
Now, assume A = k[x1, ..., xd] and that the k-algebra C(n) is generated
by {t1, ..., ts}.
Let us denote by t a point of Simp1(C(n)).
Since the
conﬁguration-space coordinates xi commute, we may ﬁnd rational sections
|xν(t) >∈˜V , ν = 1, ..., n,
that are eigenvectors for all xi, such that any point in U(n) corre-
spond to n points in the conﬁguration space given by the n possibilities,
(x1,ν(t), ..., xd,ν(t)) ν = 1, ..., n, where,
˜ρ(xi)(|xν(t) >) = xi,ν(t)|xν(t) > .
In general, the observables dxi, i=1,...,d, do not commute, but for every i
we can still ﬁnd eigenvectors,
|dxi,ν(t) >∈˜VC, ν = 1, ..., n,
such that,
˜ρ(dxi)(|dxi,ν(t) >) = dxi,ν(t)|dxi,ν(t) > .
This will be treated in the section Grand picture, Bosons, Fermions, and
Supersymmetry, where we also focus on the notion of locality of interaction.
Pick a point t0 ∈U(n) and let v0 ∈Simpn(A(σ)) represent the corre-
sponding simple module, and assume we have computed the integral curve
γ parametrized by τ, through v0, ending at v1, represented by t1 ∈U(n).
Suppose moreover that we have lifted this curve to U(n), thus beginning
in t0 and ending in t1. The evolution operator u(τ0, τ1) acts upon each
|xν(t0) >, ν = 1, ..., n. The result will have the form,
u(τ0, τ1)(|xν(t0) >) =
X
µ=1,..,n
γν,µ(τ)|xµ(t1) >
and,
u(τ0, τ1)(|dxi,ν(t0) >) =
X
µ=1,..,n
γi,ν,µ(τ)|dxi,µ(t1) >,
where each γν,µ(τ) and γi,ν,µ(τ) is a kind of action integral maybe related
to some classical Lagrangian.
We might now consider the following laboratory situation, in which there
are n3 cells {Xq1,q2,q3}qi=1,...,n,i=1,2,3, disposed in a structure like a grid of
space, with coordinates (q1, q2, q3), and each capable of clicking, if entered
by a particle. Each cell is outﬁtted with n3 sub-cells, {Y p1, Y p2, Y p3, pi =
1, ..., n, i = 1, 2, 3}, forming a system sub-cells, {Y p1,p2,p3
q1,q2,q3 }pi,qi=1,...,n,i=1,2,3,

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
59
each capable of clicking if the particle that enters is outﬁtted with a certain
momentum. Let us talk about these clicks as a q-click and a p-click respec-
tively. Interpreting {Xq1,q2,q3, q1 ≤n1, q2 ≤n2, q3 ≤n3, n1 + n2 + n3 = n}
as a basis of eigenvectors for the space-observables x1, x2, x3, and consid-
ering {Y p1, Y p2, Y p3, pi = 1, ..., n, i = 1, 2, 3}, as a basis of eigenvectors
for the momenta-observables dx1, dx2, dx3, for some versal family of n-
dimensional simple representations ˜V , deﬁned on the k-algebra C(n). The
possible outcomes of a measurement performed at time τ are now limited
to hearing a q-click in one of the n3 points in space, corresponding to the
eigenvalues of x1, x2, x3, and for each such q-click, hearing a diﬀerent p-click
corresponding to one of the n3 eigenvalues of dx1, dx2, dx3. The experiment
might consist of letting a beam of particles stream out of an outlet situated
at one of the cells, say the one corresponding to the origin X0,0,0 of the q-
grid. One checks the distribution of p-clicks from the sub-cells {Y p1,p2,p3
0,0,0
},
say {βp1, βp2, βp3}. Now, suppose we have chosen a simple representation
V (τ0) such that,
X0,0,0 =
n
X
pi=1
βpiY pi, i = 1, 2, 3,
then we measure time τ along the curve γ of U(n), starting at the point
corresponding to V (τ0), and compute,
U(τ0, τ1)(X0,0,0)) = ψ(τ1) =
X
q
αq1,q2,q3Xq1,q2,q3.
We might then want to interpret the family |αq1,q2,q3|2/|ψ(τ1)|2 as the prob-
ability distribution, at time τ1, for ﬁnding the particle, at the corresponding
point. And, correspondingly, one would be tempted to consider the nor-
malized squares of the coeﬃcients in the development,
Xq1,q2,q3(τ1) =
n
X
pi=1
βpi
q1,q2,q3Y pi(τ1), i = 1, 2, 3,
as the probability distribution for momenta observed at the point q(τ1).
However, we have to be careful, we have assumed that we might ﬁnd an
object ˜V with the properties corresponding to our preparation. This may
be possible, as we shall see in an example, see (4.7), but the interpretation
of the coeﬃcients α and β as probabilities, will probably depend upon the
introduction of Hermitian norms on the representation ˜V . Anyway, this
seems to lead to a kind of generalized Feynman’s path integral. For a good
exposition, for mathematicians, of path integrals, see [3].

4.4
Planck’s Constant(s) and Fock Space
In [19] we treated the case of a conservative system, i.e. where the vector
ﬁeld ξ or [δ] in Simpn(A(σ) is singular, i.e. vanishes, at the point v ∈
Simpn(A(σ)) corresponding to the representation V , and where therefore
the Hamiltonian Q is both the time and the energy operator, at the same
time. See Examples (4.2) and (4.3) where we show how to compute these
singularities in some classical cases.
We found, in this situation, see [20], or Chapter 1, that there is a notion
of Planck’s constant ℏ, with the ordinary properties.
Let {vi}i∈I be a basis of V (no longer assumed to be ﬁnite dimensional),
formed by eigenvectors of Q, and let the eigenvalues be given by,
Q(vi) = κivi.
Consider the set Λ(δ) of real numbers λ deﬁned by,
Λ(δ) := {λ ∈R| ∃fλ ∈Ph∞(A), fλ ̸= 0, ρV (δ(fλ)) = λρV (fλ) ∈Endk(V )}.
Since δ = [Q, −] is a derivation, if fλ and fµ are eigenvectors for δ in V ,
then if fλfµ is non-trivial, it is also an eigenvector, with eigenvalue λ + µ,
implying that if λ, µ ∈Λ(δ), with fλfµ ̸= 0, we must have λ + µ ∈Λ(δ).
Now,
λfλ · vi = δ(fλ) · vi = (Qfλ −fλQ(vi) = Q(fλ · vi) −κifλ · vi,
implying,
Q(fλ · vi) = (κi + λ) · (fλ · vi).
If fλ · vi ̸= 0, it follows that: κi + λ = κj for some j ∈I. Therefore
fλ · vi = αvj, α ∈R, and λ = κi −κj.
and so,
Λ(δ) ⊂{κi −κj| i, j},
Planck’s constant ℏshould be a generator of the monoid Λ(δ), when this is
meaningful.
We can show, see Example (4.1) and (4.3), that for the classical oscillator
Λ(δ) is an inﬁnite additive monoid.
See also that when {fλ}λ generate
Endk(V ) we must have Λ(δ) = {κi −κj| i, j}, and that when ℏtends to 0,
any f ∈Ph∞(A) maps every eigenspace V (κi) into itself. In the generic
case when all κi are diﬀerent, the image of Ph∞(A) into Endk(V ) becomes
commutative, a ring of functions on the spectrum of Q.

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
61
The above introduction of Planck’s constant(s), also make sense in gen-
eral, i.e. for the versal family of Simp(A(σ)). In fact, since
[Q, ˜ρ(−)] = ˜ρδ −[δ]˜ρ : A(σ) −→EndC(n)( ˜V )
is a derivation, we show that the set,
Λ(σ) := {λ ∈C(n)|∃fλ ∈A(σ), fλ ̸= 0, [Q, ˜ρ(δ(fλ))] = λ˜ρ(fλ)},
is a generalized additive monoid, i.e. if for λ, λ′ ∈Λ(σ) the product fλfλ′
is non-trivial, then λ + λ′ ∈Λ(σ).
Let ℏl ∈k be generators of Λ(δ). These are our Planck’s constants, see
examples (3.7) and (3.8). Now, assume there exists a C(n)-module basis
{ ˜ψi}i∈I of sections of ˜V = C(n) ⊗V , formed by eigenfunctions for the
Hamiltonian, i.e. such that
Q( ˜ψi) = κi ˜ψi, i ∈I,
where κi ∈C(n). An element such as ˜ψi ∈˜V is usually considered as a pure
state, with energy κi ∈C(n), depending on time, i.e. depending on τ, the
length along the integral curve γ. It is also considered as as an elementary
particle (since ˜V is, by assumption, simple). As in §1 we ﬁnd,
λ˜ρ(fλ)( ˜ψi) = Q(˜ρ(fλ)( ˜ψi)) −˜ρ(fλ)(Q( ˜ψi))
= Q(˜ρ(fλ)( ˜ψi)) −κi˜ρ(fλ)( ˜ψi)
implying,
Q(˜ρ(fλ)( ˜ψi)) = (κi + λ)˜ρ(fλ)( ˜ψi).
By assumption, if ˜ρ(fλ)( ˜ψi) ̸= 0 it must be an eigenvector of Q, with
eigenvalue, say κj = κi + λ. It follows that we have,
Λ(σ) ⊂{κj −κi| i, j ∈I}.
To prove that the two sets are equal we need some extra conditions on the
nature of A(σ) and ˜ρ. If {˜ρ(fλ)}λ generate EndC(n)( ˜V ), then the equality
must hold, since then {˜ρ(fλ)(ψ(0))}λ must generate ˜V as C(n)-module,
and therefore contain multiples of all ψj, so that any κl must be equal to
κ0 + λ for some λ.
Notice that if ℏgoes to 0, meaning that [Q, ˜ρ(a)] = 0, for all a ∈A(σ),
then all a ∈A(σ) must commute with Q, and so A(σ) acts diagonally on
the spectrum of Q.
Notice also that if, at a point v ∈γ, ℏ(v) ̸= 0 as an element of k = R,
it is clearly reasonable to redeﬁne δ and Q(v) by dividing both with ℏ(v).
Then the energy diﬀerences of (1/ℏ(v))Q(v) will come up as integral values.

62
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Assume that Q(τ) =: Q is constant along γ, and use the theorem
(4.2.2.).
We ﬁnd U(τ0, τ1)( ˜ψi(τ0)) = ˜ψi(τ1) = exp[
R
γ Qdτ] ( ˜ψi(τ0)) =
exp[R
γ κi(τ)dτ] ( ˜ψi(τ0)), and in particular,
∂˜ψi(τ)
∂τ
= κiexp(
Z
γ
κi(τ)dτ)( ˜ψi(τ0)) = Q( ˜ψi(τ)),
so, of course, again the Schr¨odinger’s equation, with τ as time.
For an
example of a non-constant Hamiltonian, see Example (4.8) and (4.9).
Above, Simpn(A(σ)) is our time-space , and Simp1(A) or Simp1(A(σ))
are the analogues of the classical conﬁguration space. Given an element v ∈
Simpn(A(σ)), corresponding to a simple module V of dimension n, there
are for every a ∈A(σ), a set of n possible values, namely its eigenvalues,
as operator on V . Since V is simple, the structure map,
ρV : A(σ) −→Endk(V )
is supposed surjective, and so in general (and, for order 2 dynamical sys-
tems, always) the operators ˜ρ(a) and ˜ρ(da), a ∈A, cannot all commute.
In fact, if dimkV = ∞, or dimkV is approaching ∞, see Example (4.3)
and (4.4), any one a ∈A(σ) would tend to have a conjugate, i.e. an ele-
ment b ∈A(σ), such [˜ρ(a), ˜ρ(b)] = 1. Therefore, if the values qi of ˜ρ(a))
are determined, then the values pi of ˜ρ(b) will be totally biased, and vice
versa, giving us the Heisenberg uncertainty problem. In general there is no
way of ﬁxing a point of Simp1(A(σ)) as representing V or ﬁnding natural
morphisms,
Simpn(A(σ)) −→Simpm(A(σ)), m < n.
However, as we know from Chapter 3, see also [18], there are partially
deﬁned decay maps,
Simpn(A(σ))∞:= Simpn(A(σ))−Simpn(A(σ)) →⊕n>m≥1Simpm(A(σ)).
In the very special case, where A = k[x1, ..., xp] is a commutative poly-
nomial algebra, there exists moreover, for every linear form
R
: V →k,
and every state ψ(τ) ∈˜V |γ a curve Ψ(γ) ⊂Spec(A) ≃Ap deﬁned, by its
coordinates, in the following way,
xi(τ) =
Z
˜ρ(xi)ψ(τ)/
Z
ψ(τ), i = 1, .., p.
Here ˜V |γ is identiﬁed with V ⊗kOγ, τ being a parameter of γ. If we are able
to pick common eigenfunctions {φj ∈˜Vγ}, j = 1, ..., n for ˜ρ(xi), i = 1, ..., p,
generating ˜Vγ, with eigenvalues κi
j(τ), j = 1, ..., n, i = 1, ..., p, and if

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
63
ψ(τ) = P
j λj(τ)φj, then picking the linear form deﬁned by,
R
φj = 1, j =
1, ..., n, we ﬁnd,
xi(τ) =
X
j
λj(τ)κi
j(τ)/
X
j
λj(τ),
which is a general form of Ehrenfest’s theorem.
Suppose now that we have a situation where there is a unique non-
trivial positive (as a real function) Planck’s constant, ℏ∈C(n). Consider
fℏ∈A(σ), and assume that there are among the {fλ}λ a conjugate, i.e.
a fµ such that [˜ρ(fℏ), ˜ρ(fµ)] = 1. This obviously cannot happen unless
dimkV = ∞, but see the Examples (4.3) and (4.4) for what happens at the
limit when dimkV goes to ∞.
Then we easily ﬁnd that µ = −ℏ. Moreover, if ψ0 is an eigenvector
for Q with least energy (assumed always positive), κ0, then N := f−ℏfℏ
is a quanta-counting operator, i.e. N(ψi) = i, when κi = κ0 + (i −1)ℏ, is
the i −th energy level. It follows also that [Q, f−ℏfℏ] = 0. The algebra
generated by {fℏ, f−ℏ} is a kind of a Fock representation, F on a Fock
space. Its Lie algebra of derivations turns out to contain a Virasoro-like Lie-
algebra. Since for Qh := f−ℏfℏwe have that [Qh, f−ℏ] = f−ℏ, [Qℏ, fℏ] = fℏ,
it is often seen in physical texts that one identiﬁes the Hamiltonian, Q, with
Qℏ, or with P
ℏQℏ.We shall return to this in the Examples (4.4), (4.5) and
(4.12), at the end of this Chapter. See also [30] I, (4.2), pp.173-176, and let
us pause to explain why Weinberg’s (two seemingly diﬀerent deﬁnitions of
the) creation and annihilation operators, coincide with our operators, fℏ,
resp. f−ℏ, in his case.
This is a consequence of the fact that his momentum operators, p, com-
mute with the Hamiltonian, Q. Therefore the operators ad(Q) and ad(p)
commute, and so we may ﬁnd a common set of eigenvectors for these op-
erators. The result is that the creator operators deﬁned w.r.t. energy, Q,
and w.r.t. momentum p, should be physically equivalent.
We have seen that starting with a ﬁnitely generated k-algebra A,
and a dynamical system σ, we have created an inﬁnite series of spaces
Simpn(A(σ)) and a quantum theory, on ´etale coverings U(n), of these
spaces, with time being deﬁned by the Dirac derivation δ.
Each C(n) is commutative and ˜V
is a versal bundle on U(n) ⊂
Simp1(C(n)). Moreover, the elements of A(σ), the observables, become
sections of the bundle of operators, EndC(n)( ˜V ).
Clearly, if D ⊂Simp1(C(n)) is a subvariety, say a curve parametrized
by some parameter q, then the universal family induces a homomorphism

64
Geometry of Time-Spaces
of algebras,
˜ρD : A(σ) −→EndD( ˜V |D).
This is in many recent texts referred to as a quantiﬁcation of the commu-
tative algebra A(σ)/[A(σ), A(σ)], or to a quantiﬁcation deformation, and
the parameter q is sometimes confounded with Planck’s constant. This is
unfortunate, but probably unavoidable!
In quantum theory one attempts to treat the second quantiﬁcation of
an oscillator in dimension 1, as a certain representation on the Fock space,
i.e. constructing observables acting on Fock space, with the properties one
wants.
This turns out to be related to the canonical representations of
Ph(C) := k < x, dx > on an n-bundle over the algebra, R := k[[n]p,q].
Here the p, q-deformed numbers [n]p,q are introduced as,
[n]p,q := qn−1 + pqn−2 + p2qn−3 + ... + pn−2q + pn−1,
and we may as well consider p, q as formal variables, so that R ⊂k[p, q].
See Example (4.5) where we construct a homomorphism of A(σ) into
an endomorphism ring of the form EndR(V ⊗k R), see ([2], Appendice,
on the q-commutators). Picking representatives for x and dx in Mn(R), it
turns out that, instead of the classical deﬁning relations for an oscillator,
i.e. with a+ := x + dx, a−: x −dx, and with a Hamiltonian Q, such that
in EndR(V ⊗k R),
[Q, x] = dx, [Q, dx] = x, [a−, a+] = 1
one obtains,
[Q, x]q = dx, [Q, dx]q = x, [a−, a+]q = 1
where [a, b]q := ab −qba is the quantized commutator. This holds in par-
ticular for p = 1, so for R = k[q], deﬁning a curve D in Simpn(Ph(k[x])).
However, this k[q]-parametrization is not parametrizing an integral
curve of ξ in Simpn(Ph(C)). On the contrary, it is parametrizing a curve of
anyons with q = −1, 1 corresponding to, respectively, Fermions and Bosons.
A simple computation shows that it is transversal to ξ, and therefore rep-
resent a phenomenon which takes place instantaneously, see the Examples
(4.4), (4.5).

General Quantum Fields, Lagrangians and Actions
Given algebras A and B, supposed to be moduli spaces of interesting ob-
jects. Given dynamical structures (say of order 2) (σ) and (µ) of Ph∞(A)

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
65
and Ph∞(B) respectively, corresponding to Dirac derivations, and corre-
sponding vector ﬁelds, δσ, ξσ and δµ, ξµ, respectively, we consider the set
(or space, see Chapter 3), F(A, B), of iso-classes, of morphisms φ : A →B.
Any such induces a morphism,
Ph(φ) : PhA →PhB.
and we shall assume also a morphism,
φ : A(σ) →B(µ).
This is actually what we shall call a ﬁeld. The space of such is denoted
F(A, B).
The meaning of the term ﬁeld, or its physical interpretation, is not
obvious. In standard physics texts the notion is rarely well deﬁned, see
e.g. [30], I, (1.2), where one ﬁnds a nice historical introduction, and good
reasons for lots of mathematical tears!
I would like to consider φ : A →B as a morphism of the moduli space
Spec(B), of physical objects Y , into the moduli space Spec(A), of physical
objects X, and in this way modeling composite physical objects (X, Y ), as
we shall see below.
Now, apply the deformation theory of categories of algebras, see e.g.
[14]. From this theory follows readily that the tangent space of F(A, B) at
a point, φ, is,
TF(A,B),φ = Derk(A(σ), B(µ))/Triv,
where, as usual, Triv depends upon the deﬁnition of F(A, B), i.e. upon
the notion of isomorphisms among ﬁelds, see [14].
Unfortunately, this moduli space, F(A, B), is not, in general, a
prescheme, neither commutative nor non-commutative. As we have, as a
rule in this paper, identiﬁed any k-algebra with some space, we shall, never
the less, at this point not hesitate to identify F(A, B) with the k-algebra
of (reasonable) functions (or operators) deﬁned on the space, and denote it
by, F(A, B). Then we are free to consider the versal (or maybe, universal)
family of quantum ﬁelds,
˜φ : A →F(A, B) ⊗k B.
Just in the same way as above, there is now a canonical vector ﬁeld [δ] on
the space F(A, B), deﬁned by its value at φ, given by,
[δ](φ) = cl(δσφ −φδµ).

66
Geometry of Time-Spaces
The set of stable, or singular ﬁelds, is now in complete analogy with the
singular points in Simp(A(σ)) mentioned above, and treated in detail in
the examples, (3.5)-(3.9) below,
M(A, B) := {φ ∈F(A, B)|[δ](φ) = 0}.
Here one sees where the Noether function Q enters.
In fact, if we are
identifying ﬁelds up to automorphisms of B deﬁned by trivial derivations,
[δ](φ) = 0 is equivalent to the existence of a Hamiltonian Q ∈B(µ), such
that for every a ∈A(σ)
δB(φ(a)) −φ(δA(a)) = Qφ(a) −φ(a)Q = [Q, φ(a)].
Consider this equation in rank 1, i.e. look at the commutativizations
Ham :A(σ) →A(σ)/[A(σ), A(σ)] =: A0(σ).
Ham :B(µ) →B(µ)/[B(µ), B(µ)] =: B0(µ),
We ﬁnd that in Simp1(B(µ)) the equation above reduces to,
δB(φ(a)) = φ(δA(a)),
which, geometrically, means the following: If γ is an integral curve of δA,
in U A(n), then the inverse image via φ is a union of integral curves for δB
in U B(n).
The actual deﬁnition of a dynamical structure (σ) has, up to now, been
loosely treated. It may be deﬁned in terms of force laws i.e. where (σ) is
the two-sided δ-stable ideal generated by the equations (δntp −Γp), where,
δntp := dntp, Γp(ti, dtj, d2tk, .., dn−1tl) ∈Ph∞(A), p = 1, 2, ..., d.
But, in general, force laws like these don’t pop up naturally. In fact, Nature
seems to reveal its structure through some Action Principles. The physicists
are looking for a Lagrangian L, and an action functional S(L) deﬁned on
F(A, B). In our setting, L is simply an element,
L ∈Ph(A).
For every ﬁeld φ ∈F(A, B), the action, usually denoted,
S(φ) := S(L)(φ) ∈k,
is constructed via some particularly chosen representation,
ρ : B(µ) →Endk(V ).
Put, L := ρ(φ(L)) and let,
S(φ) := Tr(L)).

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
67
In the classical case the trace, Tr, is an integral.
We may choose several canonical representations ρ, like the versal family
of rank 1 representations, treated above, and called,
Ham : Ph(B) →Ph0(B) := Ph(B)/[Ph(B), Ph(B)],
or the corresponding in rank n. We may also, for any derivation ζ of B,
consider the canonical homomorphism ρζ : Ph(B) →B, as a representa-
tion. In the ﬁrst case it is clear that Tr(L) is simply the image of L in
Ph0(B). In the last case the Lagrangian density, i.e. L, is now a function,
L(φi, ζ(φj)), in φi := φ(ti), and in ζ(φj) for some generators ti of A, and
Tr is an integral over some reasonably well deﬁned subspace of Simp1(B).
In this case one usually has to impose some boundary conditions on φ.
Clearly, S := Sρ = Tr(L) is a function,
S : F(A, B) →k,
and ∇S ∈ΘF(A,B), is a vector ﬁeld that corresponds to the fundamental
vector ﬁeld ξ = [δ], above. The equations deﬁning the singularities of ∇S,
is usually written,
δS := δ
Z
L = 0,
since for most classical representations the dimension of V is inﬁnite, and
the trace is an integral, see examples below.
Here is where the calculus of variation comes in. The corresponding
Euler-Lagrange equations, the equations of motion, picks out the set of
solutions, the singular ﬁelds, i.e. M(A, B) ⊂F(A, B).
The subspaces M(A, B) in F(A, B), deﬁned by the Euler-Lagrange
equations, are therefore uniquely deﬁned by L, without reference to any
dynamical structures of A or B..
The problem with this is that, unless there actually exist a dynamical
structure corresponding to ∇S, we cannot know that our laws of nature
are mathematically deterministic, see the Introduction, and compare [30],
I, chapter 7.
Notice that the classical ﬁeld theory corresponds to the situation where
A = k[t] and B = k[x], and where φ is deﬁned in terms of the ﬁelds,
φi := φ(ti), and their time derivatives ˙φi := φ(dti) := dφi ∈Ph(B).
Choosing the representation ρζ for some derivation ζ, of B, we may assume
the Lagrangian density has the form,
L := L(φi, φj,α)

68
Geometry of Time-Spaces
where φj,α := ∂φj
∂xα . The singular ﬁelds, are then picked out by the variation
of the action integral, i.e.
δ
Z
Ldµ = 0,
or by the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations,
∂L
∂φi
−
X
α
∂
∂xα
( ∂L
∂φi,α
) = 0.
In the light of the above, considering these equations as equations of motion,
is now, maybe, a reasonable guess.
In fact, we shall show that this Lagrangian theory actually produce a
dynamical structure, at least in special cases.
Pick a Lagrangian L ∈Ph(A), and assume B = Mn(k), so that
F(A, B) = Repn(A) ⊂Repn(Ph(A)).
Restrict to Simpn(Ph(A)) ⊂
Repn(Ph(A)), and consider the versal family,
˜ρ : Ph(A) →Mn(C(n)).
Put L := ˜ρ(L) ∈Mn(C(n)) and S := TrL ∈C(n). If the choice of the
Lagrangian L, is clever, the gradient, ∇S ∈ΘC(n), restricted to U(n) is
a candidate for the vector ﬁeld ξ = [δ], induced by the Dirac derivation δ
deﬁned by some dynamical structure, A(σ). If the philosophy of contem-
porary physics is consistent, this is what we would expect.
Based on the parsimony principle involved in the theory of Lagrange,
and given a dynamical system, with Dirac derivation δ, we should expect
that the Lagrangian L is constant in time, i.e. that we have the Lagrangian
equation,
δ(L) = 0.
But then Theorem (3.4) tells us that, in the situation above, we have in
C(n),
[δ](TrL) = 0,
i.e. for all n ≥1, the equation ∇S = 0, picks out the solutions γ of the the-
ory. Now we may try to turn the argument upside down, and ask whether,
given L, we may construct a Dirac derivation, δ, from the Lagrangian equa-
tion above. This is the purpose of the next examples. But be aware, this
is not proving that the Lagrangian method for studying quantum ﬁelds,
is equivalent to the one I propose above. Example (4.4) shows that there
exists simple Lagrangians L inducing unique force laws, but such that the

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
69
set of solutions {γ} is not determined by ker(δ). Moreover, the classical
relation between the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian turns out to be more
subtle in this non-commutative case. Notice that, above, we have accepted
ﬁelds φ : A →B where B = Mn(k) is a ﬁnite non-commutative space, for
which the usual Euler-Lagrange equations do not apply.
Solving diﬀerential equations like the Lagrange equation, in non-
commutative algebras, is not easy.
However, if we reduce to the corre-
sponding commutative quotient, things become much easier. In fact, as we
mentioned in the Introduction, in the commutative situation we may write,
in Ph(A),
δ =
X
i
(dti
∂
∂ti
+ d2ti
∂
∂dti
),
and the Lagrange equation will produce order 2 dynamical structures, see
Example (4.1). We may also consider the Euler-Lagrange equations, impose
δ, as time, and solve,
δ( ∂L
∂dti
) −∂L
∂ti
= 0,
to ﬁnd an order 2 force law, d2ti = Γ(ti, dtj).
The strategy will be to solve the equation in a representation like Ham,
then try to lift it to Ph(A) and then, eventually, map it back to say Wey :
Ph(A) →Diffk(A, A). We shall now show that this strategy works in
some interesting cases.
But let us ﬁrst have a look at the relationship, as we see it, between the
picture we have drawn of QFT, and the one physicists presents in modern
university textbooks.
4.6
Grand Picture: Bosons, Fermions, and Supersymmetry
Consider a situation with a dynamical system, with Dirac derivation δ, and
ﬁx the rank n versal family,
A(σ) →EndC(n)( ˜V ).
Look at the singularities of the fundamental vectorﬁeld ξ ∈Derk(C(n)).
Let V be a corresponding representation, the particle. Compute the set of
eigenvalues Λ of adQ acting on Endk(V ), and the set of minimal elements,
i.e. the set of Planck’s constants, {ℏ}, and the corresponding eigenvectors
fℏ∈Endk(V ). We shall see in Examples (4.3) and (4.4), that if there exists

70
Geometry of Time-Spaces
a conjugate to fℏ, it must be f−ℏ. If the Hamiltonian, Q, is diagonalized,
with eigenvalues {q0 ≤q1 ≤... ≤qn−1} it is of course easy to see that
Λ = {(qi−qj)}i,j=0,...,n−1, fλ = P
qi−qj=λ ϵi,j, and in particular, f−ℏ= f ∗
ℏ,
the conjugate matrix.
Anyway, choosing a vacuum state φ0 ∈V for the Hamiltonian Q, i.e.
an eigenvector with minimal positive-or zero-eigenvalue, we ﬁnd that, for
some i ≥0, unless f i
ℏ= 0, we have Q(f i
ℏ(φ0)) = iℏfℏ(ψ0), i.e. the state
φi := f i
ℏ(φ0) may be occupied by i quantas. If {φi}i=0,..,n−1 is a basis for
V then this is the purely Bosonic case, with qi −qi−1 = ℏ, see (4.4), where
we have treated the simple case of the harmonic oscillator.
What do I mean by state occupied by several quantas? The language
is far from clear. Here we shall restrict ourself to the elementary language
of quantum physics,. The phrase, the state φ is occupied by n quanta shall
mean that φ is an eigen-state of the Hamiltonian Q, with eigen-value nℏ.
We shall also, as is explained above, assume ℏ= 1.
Physicists have come to the realization that there exist two types of
particles, Bosons and Fermions, with diﬀerent statistics, in the sense that
states containing several identical Bosons are invariant upon permutations
of these, but states containing several identical Fermions change sign with
the permutation.
This is another way of expressing that Fermions, like
electrons, cannot all sink in to the lowest energy state in an atom, and stay
there, killing chemistry.
We shall delay the discussion of collections of identical particles to Chap-
ter 5.
Bosons can have states with an arbitrary occupation number, but
Fermions have states only with occupation numbers 0 or 1.
If we know that no states are occupied by more than one quantum at a
time, then we must conclude that,
f 2
ℏ= f 2
−ℏ= 0.
Moreover, we pose,
{fℏ, f−ℏ} := f−ℏfℏ+ fℏf−ℏ= 1,
implying, (fℏ+ f−ℏ)2 = 1. This is the purely Fermionic case.
These relations induce a split-up of the representation V , i.e.
V ≃V0 ⊕V1,
In fact, put R0 := fℏf−ℏ, R1 := f−ℏfℏ, and see that
R0 + R1 = 1, R0R1 = R1R0 = 0, R2
i = Ri, i = 0, 1,

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
71
and put V0 = imR0, V1 = imR1. Since Ri is the identity on Vi, it is clear
that the two linear maps,
f−ℏ: V0 →V1, fℏ: V1 →V0,
are isomorphisms, thus dimkV0 = dimkV1 = 1/2 n. Clearly, any endomor-
phism of V can be cut up into a sum of graded endomorphisms. Those of
degree 0 we would like to call Bosonic. Those of degree 1, or -1, should
then be called Fermionic. In dimension 4, this would look like:
Q =

In the general case we may have a mix of Bosons and Fermions present,
and this leads to the notion of super symmetry.
If we have a split up, as above, the modules Vi, i = 1, 2, having the
Hamiltonians Q0, and Q1 := Q + 1, implying that, as Hamiltonians, Qo =
Q1, we see that Endk(V ) is generated by the Bosonic operators, a :=
fℏ, a+ := f−ℏ∈Endk(Vi), both deﬁned for Q0 = Q1, together with the
Fermionic operators f −:= fℏ∈Homk(V1, V0), f +
−ℏ∈Homk(V0, V1), for
the Hamiltonian Q. In fact,
Endk(V ) =

is generated by the Endk(V0) and Endk(V1), together with the isomor-
phisms f−ℏ:= (V0 →V1) ∈Homk(V0, V1), fℏ:= (V1 →V0) ∈
Homk(V1, V0).
Put, f = ı(f −+ f +), and see that there are two eigenstates of f, the
Fermion with eigenvalue 1, and the anti-Fermion with eigenvalue -1.
The general situation is much like the one above. We may assume that
we have a Hamiltonian Q, split up as above, with corresponding Bosonic
operators, al, a+
l , and Fermionic operators, fp, f +
p , generating Endk(V ).
We may also assume that, given the vacuum state φ0 ∈V , there is a
basis of V , given by {φi := (a+
l )i(φ0)}n−1
i=0 . Moreover al kills φ0, and a+
l

kills φn−1. Considering the versal family ˜ρ, and the global Hamiltonian
Q ∈EndC(n)( ˜V ), the situation becomes more subtle. Here we have the
´etale morphism π : U(n) →Simpn(A(σ)).
Fix the ﬁeld k = R, and
assume no harm is made by this choice. Clearly we have a monodromy
homomorphism,
µ(v) : π1(v; Simpn(A(σ))) →Aut(V ) ≃Gln(R).
One would be tempted to deﬁne Bosons, Fermions, and Anyons, with re-
spect to this monodromy map. The component of Simpn(A(σ)) where µ(v)
is trivial are Bosonic, the one with im(µ(v)) = {+1, −1} ≃Z2 is Fermionic,
and the rest are Anyonic. Notice that the ﬁber of π is composed of identical
particles. The treatment of such are, as mentioned above, postponed until
Chapter 5.
If Q is constant, we may of course assume that the Bosonic operators,
al, a+
l , and Fermionic operators, fp, f +
p , are elements of EndC(n)( ˜V ),
generating EndC(n)( ˜V ), as C(n)-module. Then any quantum ﬁeld would
look like,
ψ(v) = ψ(v, a, a+, f, f +),
the functions being polynomials in the operator variables. In particular
˜ρ(tj) and ˜ρ(dtj) would have this form, where, in most cases relevant for
physics, the polynomial function would be linear, see the case of the har-
monic oscillator, Example (4.4).
This is very close to the form one ﬁnds in physics books, the only prob-
lem is that the function ψ is a function on Simp(A(σ)), not on the conﬁg-
uration space, with ﬁxed momentum, as is usually the case in physics.
Suppose we have a classical case, where the algebra A = k[t1, ..., tr] is
the commutative aﬃne algebra of the conﬁguration variety, X := Spec(A).
Then an element v ∈Simpn(A(σ)) will correspond to up to n diﬀerent
points in qi ∈X. If one imposes commutation rules on the dtj, as physi-
cists do, then to v, there corresponds also up to n values of the momenta,
pl ∈Spec(k[dt1, ..., dtr]). However, there is no way to pinpoint the repre-
sentation v, by ﬁxing q and p. Because ti and dti do not commute, which
imposes the Heisenberg uncertainty relation with respect to determining
q′s and p′s, at the same time, the physicists will have to introduce some
mean values, using diﬀerent versions of the spectral theorem for Hermitian
operators, to obtain reasonable deﬁnitions of the notion of quantum ﬁeld.
Usually the generators, of the algebra of quantum ﬁelds, are expressed in

see [30], I, p.260. Here σ means spin, n the particle species, and nc the
antiparticle of the species n. Integration is on diﬀerent domains, depending
on the situation. and the whole thing is deduced from ordinary quantum
theory, imposing relativistic invariance.
The corresponding interpretation of interaction, implies that interaction
takes place at points in conﬁguration space. This is the so called locality
of action. See the very readable article of Gilles Cohen-Tannoudji in [11],
p.104.
Of course, the interesting Hamiltonians Q ∈EndC(n)( ˜V ) will not be
constant, therefore physicists introduce what is called perturbation theory,
which amounts to assuming that there exists a background situation, de-
ﬁned by an essentially constant Hamiltonian Q0, such that for the real
situation, given by the versal family ˜ρ : A(σ) →EndC(n)( ˜V ), and the
Dirac derivation δ, the Hamiltonian Q may be considered as a perturbation
of Q0, with an interaction I ∈EndC(n)( ˜V ), such that,
Q = Q0 + I.
Then, using the basis {φi}, given for ˜V , deﬁned by the creation operators
{a+
l }, see above, one may apply Theorem (4.2.2), and obtain formulas for
the evaluation operator, along the curve γ, applied to any φi. If we have a
Hermitian metric on the bundle ˜V , then we obtain formulas for the so called
S = (Si,j)-matrix, calculating the probability for a φi observed at the start-
point v0 of γ, to be observed as changed into φj, at the end-point v1. The
same types of formulas as one ﬁnds in elementary physics books, like [30], I,
p.260, pop up. And the computation is again made easier by chopping up
the formulas, by introdusing Feynman diagrams. In our case, the integrals
along the compact γ, are, of course, easily seen to be well deﬁned, but then
we have not explained how we may know that our preparation gave us the
start-point v0.
This is where the problem of locality of action enters.
Suppose we
have ﬁxed a basis, {φi}n−1
i=0 , of the C(n)-module of sections of ˜V , composed
of common eigenvectors for the commuting operators, ˜ρ(tj) ∈EndC(n)( ˜V ).
Suppose also that the operator [˜ρ(tj), ˜ρ(dtj)] is suﬃciently close to the iden-
tity, or rather, strictly bigger than zero on a compact part of Simpn(A(σ)),

74
Geometry of Time-Spaces
see Examples (4.4) and (4.5). Notice again that it must have a vanishing
trace, since we are in ﬁnite dimension. Fix an index l and let {κi(l)}n−1
i=0 be
a basis of the C(n)-module of sections of ˜V , composed of eigenvectors for
the operator ˜ρ(dtl). Then, given a v ∈Simpn(A(σ)), represented by the
n-dimensional A(σ)-module V , we have,
tj(φi) = qj
i φi, dtl(κj(l)) = pl
jκj(l),
where, for i = 0, ..., n −1, qi(v) := qi = (q1
i , ..., qr
i ) ∈X are the possible
conﬁguration positions of v, and, for j = 0, ..., n −1, the possible values
of the l-component of the momenta, are given by, pl
j(v) := pl
j. Consider
now the base-change matrices, (λj
i ), and (µj
i), such that, φj = P λj
iκi, and
κj = P µj
iφi, and compute [dtl, tl](φi). We obtain,
[dtl, tl](φi) =
X
j,k
λi
jpl
jµj
k(ql
i −ql
k)φk.
By assumption, the base change matrices, (λj
i ), and (µj
i), must be bounded
on the compact subset of Simpn(A(σ)), and the operator [dtl, tl] is not
trivial in the same subset. This implies that when the l-coordinate of the
conﬁguration positions are clustered tightly about a certain point, then
the l-coordinate of the corresponding momenta cannot be kept bounded.
This is the analogy of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation of the classical
quantum theory.
With this in mind, one would be tempted to formulate the task of the
experimenter in physics, as follows.
She should test out the possibilities of the laboratory technology, to
prepare the situation by bounding the conﬁguration positions of the phe-
nomenon she is interested in, to a subset D(q) ⊂X := Spec(k[t1, ..., tr]),
and at the same time bound the corresponding l-component of the mo-
menta, to a subset D(p, l) ⊂Y := Spec(k[dt1, ..., dtr]) by performing repet-
itive experiments. Each experiment, setting up the preparation would have
to be performed within a short time interval ∆τ. Then she should compute
the subset,
D(q, p, l) = {v ∈Simp(A(σ))|qi(v) ∈D(q), pl
j(v) ∈D(p, l), i, j = 1, ..., r},
and ﬁnally, she should compute for each v ∈D(q, p, l) the solution curve
γv(τ) through v with length τ, that is, with time-development τ, ending at
v(τ). The end-points of all of these curves, would form a subset D(q, p, l : τ),
and one would expect that the result of letting the phenomenon develop

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
75
through the time-interval τ, would give position and momenta results within
the subsets,
D(q : τ) = {qi(v)|v ∈D(q, p : τ)}, D(p, l : τ) = {pl
i(v)|v ∈D(q, p, l : τ)}.
The philosophically interesting result would be that no interaction is really
local.
One interesting consequence of the above assumption, our Heisenberg
uncertainty relation, is that if we are considering a natural phenomenon
related to a macroscopic object, i.e. such that all |ql
k −ql
i| are allowed to
be, relatively, very big, then we may prepare the object in such a way that
all |pl
k −pl
i| are very small. We then have a classical situation, where the
result would be, relatively, unique! The Big Bang, see the last subsection
of this Chapter, would in this respect, be the extreme opposite situation,
where we are totally incapable to trace unique curves, γ, from the assumed
unique point in conﬁguration space where BB happens. And, of course, the
End of it all, would correspond to a totally homogenous universe, with a
uniquely given future!
Example
4.1. Let C be a ﬁnite type commutative k-algebra, say
parametrizing an interesting moduli space, and assume it is non-singular,
and pick a system of regular coordinates {t1, t2, ..., tr} in C. The problem of
constructing a dynamical system of interest to physics, has been discussed
in the Introduction, and above. We may consider an element L ∈Ph(C), a
Lagrangian, and try to ﬁnd a force law, with Dirac derivation δ, such that,
δ(L) = 0.
We could start with the trivial Lagrangian, L := g = P
i=1,..,r dt2
i ∈PhC.
The Lagrange equation becomes, 0 = δ(g) = P
i=1,..,r(d2tidti + dtid2ti) ∈
PhC. with the obvious solution,
d2ti = 0, i = 1, ..., r.
inducing a dynamical structure (σ) in Ph(C), generated by the relations,
[dti, tj] + [ti, dtj], [dti, dtj], i ̸= j.
The corresponding dynamic system, C(σ), is the dynamical system for a free
particle. Notice however, that, classically, one imposes also the relations,
[dti, tj] = 0 for i ̸= j, and [dti, ti] = 1.
Consider the representations of dimension 1, corresponding to ρ =
Ham, and use Theorem (3.2), with n=1. Then, obviously, the Hamilto-
nian Q must be a function, and we ﬁnd,
˜ρ(dti) = [δ](ti), 0 = ˜ρ(δ2(ti)) = [δ]([δ](ti)).

This ﬁts well with,
[δ] =

which gives us the canonical symplectic structure on the commutativization
of Ph(C), the C(1) for this situation. Notice that the corresponding Poisson
bracket now give us,
{dti, tj} = δi,j,
deﬁning a deformation of the commutative phase space which is the quotient
of C(σ) deﬁned above.

Connections and the Generic Dynamical Structure
Now, let, L := g = 1/2 P
i,j=1,..,r gi,jdtidtj ∈PhC, be a Riemannian

on the right hand side, and see that we have got a solution of the Lagrange
equation,
δ(L) = 0,
in the commutative situation. This solution has the form of a force law,
d2tl = −Γl := −
X
Γl
i,jdtidtj,
generating a dynamical structure (σ) := (σ(g)) of order 2. The dynamic
system is, of course, as an algebra,
C(σ) = k[t, ξ]
where ξj is the class of dtj. The Dirac derivation now has the form,
δ =

),

and the fundamental vector ﬁeld [δ] in Simp1(C(σ)) = Spec(k[ti, ξj]), is, of
course, the same. Use Theorem (4.2.3),(ii), and see that [δ](g) = 0, which
means that g is constant along the integral curves of [δ] in Simp1(Ph(C)),
which projects onto Simp1(C) to give the geodesics of the metric g, with
equations,

Classsically we deﬁne the curvature tensor Ri,j(δk) = P
l Rl
i,j,kδl, of a

We ﬁnd,
([∇δi, ∇δj] −∇[δi,δj])(δk) =
X
l
Rl
i,j,kδl.
This, we shall see, is a commutative version of the more precise notion of
curvature, related to a more general dynamic system, to be studied below.
Recall that the Ricci tensor is given as,
Rici,k(g) =
X
j

i,j,k
and that, assuming the metric is non-degenerate with inverse gk,i, one de-
ﬁnes the scalar curvature of g, as,
S(g) :=
X
k,i
gk,iRici,k.
These are fundamental metric invariants. Recall also Einstein’s equa-
tion,
Ric −1/2S(g)g = U,
where U is the stress-mass tensor.
A non-degenerate metric, g ∈Ph(C) induces an isomorphism of C-
modules
ΘC = HomC(ΩC, C) ≃ΩC.

78
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Assume ﬁrst that g = 1/2 Pd
i=1 dt2
i , i.e. assume that the space is Euclidean,
and pick a basis {δi :=
∂
∂ti } of ΘC, and a basis {dtj} of ΩC such that,
δj(dti) = δi,j.
Consider a C-module, V . Any connection ∇on V induces a homomor-
phism,
ρ := ρ∇: Ph(C) →Endk(V ),
with, ρ(dti) := ∇δi =
∂
∂ti + ∇i. To see this we just have to check that
the relations, [dti, tj] + [ti, dtj] = 0, in Ph(C) are not violated. Since we
obviously have,
ρ([dti, tj]) = [∇δi, ρ(tj)] = δi,j,
the homomorphism ρ is well deﬁned. We are therefore led to consider the
dynamical structure on C, generated by the ideal,
(σ) := ([dti, tj] −δi,j) ⊂Ph∞(C).
Since δ(ti) = [g, ti] = dti, the Dirac derivation is given by,
δ = ad(g).
(σ) is clearly invariant under isometries. Moreover, in C(σ) we have,
δ2(ti) = −1/2
X
k
(dtk[dti, dtk] + [dti, dtk]dtk).
Notice that if d2ti = 0 for i=1,..,d, then [dti, dtj] = 0, for all i,j. This
will also be true for any constant metric.
Given any connection, ∇, on an C-module, V , and consider the cor-
responding representation, ρ : Ph(C) →Endk(V ). If V is of inﬁnite di-
mension as k-vector space, we cannot prove that there is a useful moduli
space in which V is a point. However we now know that ρ is singular. This
follows since there exist a Hamiltonian, Q := ρ(g) ∈Endk(V ), such that
for all a ∈Ph(C),
ρ(da) = [Q, ρ(a)].
In particular we have, ρ(dti) = ∇δi = [Q, ti]. This imply,
Q = 1/2

Thus for any connection ∇we ﬁnd a force law, in Endk(V ), given by,

We shall in this situation use the notations,
Ri,j := [dti, dtj] ∈Ph(C), Fi,j := [∇δi, ∇δj] ∈EndC(V ),
Fi,j being the curvature tensor, of the connection. Below we shall come
back to these notions in the general situation.
Since we now have,
∇δjFi,j = Fi,j∇δj + (∂Fi,j
∂tj
+ [∇j, Fi,j])
we ﬁnd the following equation,
ρ∇(d2t) = −Fρ(dt) −q,
where q (by deﬁnition) is the charge of the ﬁeld. q, is a vector, the coordi-
nates of which,
qi = 1/2
r
X
j=1
(∂Fi,j
∂tj
+ [∇j, Fi,j]),
are endomorphisms of the bundle. See Example (3.16).
Suppose now that we have a free ﬁeld, i.e. one with ρ∇(d2t) = 0, so
that ρ∇([dti, dtj]) = 0, and put,
P i := ρ∇(dti), Ji,j := ρ∇(tidtj −tjdti).
A short computation then gives us,
[P i, P j] = 0, [P i, Jj,k] = δi,jP k −δj,kP j
[Ji,j, Jr,s] = δj,rJi,s + δi,sJj,r −δi,rJj,s −δj,sJi,r.
Notice that for the Minkowski metric, this gives us the usual formulas for
the commutation relations of the Lorentz Lie algebra.
As we shall see in several examples, the dynamic structure deﬁned above
is suﬃciently general to serve as basis for what is usually called quantiza-
tion, of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. For the gravitational ﬁeld, we have to do
some more work.
Let us look at the last ﬁrst. We then have to consider a general, non-
degenerate, metric, g = 1/2 Pd
i=1 gi,jdtidtj, and the corresponding dynam-
ical system, (σ) = ([dti, tj] −gi,j). Again it is easy to see that this is not
violating the relations, [dti, tj] + [ti, dtj] = 0 of Ph(C). Notice also that in
C(σ) we have,

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law

We shall consider the above formula as a general Force Law, in Ph(C),
induced by the metric g. As explained before, this means the following:
Let c be the δ- stable ideal generated by this equation in Ph∞(C). Since
the force law above holds in the dynamical system deﬁned by (σ), we ob-
viously have c ⊂(σ), and we may hope this new dynamical system leads
to a Quantum Field Theory, as deﬁned above, with new and interesting
properties. We know that this dynamical structure reduces to the generic
structure for connections, i.e. for the singular cases.
Notice that this force law reduces to an equation of motion in General
Relativity, in the representation-dimension 1 case, i.e. in the commutative
case. More interesting is that it leads to both Lorentz force law, and to
Maxwell’s ﬁeld-equations for Electro-Magnetism in the classical ﬂat-space-
situation, see Examples (4.12) and (4.13).
An easy calculation in C(σ), shows that,
[T, dti] = 1/2

gl,idtj =: qi.
But, be careful, these q′
is no longer vanish in the classical phase-space, i.e.
in the commutativization of Ph(C).
Now, choose a representation ρE : C(σ) →Endk(E), i.e. a connec-
tion ∇, on a C-module E. The generalized curvature Fi,j =: F(ξi, ξj) ∈
EndC(E) maps to the classical one, and we observe that there is an in-
teraction between the geometry, deﬁned by the metric g and the geometry
deﬁned by the connection ∇. Our Force Law above will now take the form,

See also Example (4.14).
Notice also, that for the Levi-Civita connection, there is a possible re-
lationship between this formula and the Einstein ﬁeld equation. See [27],
Proposition 4.2.2., p.114. If, above we assume that we are in a geodesic
reference frame, i.e. along a geodesic γ in our space Simp1(C), then an
average of the excess-relative-acceleration, i.e.
of d2ti + P

evaluated in ΘC|γ, is proved to be given by the Ric tensor. But, above this

Geometry of Time-Spaces
Since this excess-relative-acceleration, representing a tidal force, should
be a measure of the inertial mass present, it is tempting to consider this
force law as a generalized, quantized, Maxwell-Einstein’s equation. The
reference to Maxwell here is natural, since if the bundle E = ΘC above is the
tangent bundle, and we consider the connection, given by the potential A =
(A1, ..., An), Ai ∈C, then the resulting curvature is the electro-magnetic
force ﬁeld. See Example (4.13) for the notion of Charge, and see Example
(4.12), where the problem of Mass will be addressed.
In this generality, it is not really meaningful to ask for invariance of
this general Force Law, w.r.t. isometries. This is linked to the fact that,
in general, this force law, considered as a dynamical structure on C, may
have non-singular ﬁnite-dimensional representations, and then invariance
under isometries of Simp1(C) is not the proper question to pose. We shall
come back to this later, but see Example (4.12) for relations to Newton and
Kepler’s laws.
Notice that applying ρ, corresponding to the Levi-Civita connection,
the above translate into,
ρ(d2ti) =
d
X
j=1
[Q, gi,j∇δj],
where Q is the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
Before we turn to situations requiring a general quantum theoretical
treatment, let us go back to the discussion above, about how to look at
parsimony, via Lagrange functions or via dynamical systems. We claimed
that the integral curves of the vector ﬁeld
δ =
X
l
(ξl
∂
∂tl
−Γl ∂
∂ξl
),
in Simp1Ph(C), projects onto the geodesics of the metric g in Simp1(C).
These geodesics are assumed to be trajectories of free test particles in the
geometric space Simp1(C) outﬁtted with the the metric g. As such they
must be curves parametrized by some clock parameter τ.
Since quan-
tum ﬁeld theory is assumed to model such movements, we now have two
diﬀerent methods to pick out such trajectories, i.e. to ﬁnd the solutions
M(C, k[τ]) ⊂F(C, k[τ]).
One, using dynamic systems, the force law
d2ti = −P Γi
p,qdtpdtq, deduced above for C, and the obvious d2τ = 0, for
the free particle modeled by B := k[τ], the other using the Euler-Lagrange
equations as described above.
In the ﬁrst case we have the equation,
δB(φ) −φ(δC) = 0,

which evaluated at d2ti give us,
φ(−

p,qdtpdtq) = ( ∂
∂τ )2(φi)dτ 2,
with the resulting equation,
¨φi = −

Γi
p,q ˙φp ˙φq,
i.e. the equations for a geodesic.
In the second case, we should use the obvious derivation ζ =
∂
∂τ , the
corresponding representation ρζ : Ph(k[τ]) →k[τ], pick the Lagrangian
L := g, and look at the resulting action and corresponding Euler-Lagrange
equations. We obtain,
L =
X
gp,q ˙φp ˙φq
S =

gp,q ˙φp ˙φqdτ,
together with the Euler-Lagrange equations,
∂g
∂φi
−∂
∂τ ( ∂g
∂˙φi
) = 0
which reduces to the same equations for geodesics.
Example 4.2. With this done, let us consider some easy examples of quan-
tum theory, ﬁrst in dimension 1, and still in rank 1. That is, we start with
the k-algebra C = k < x >= k[x], and consider the classical Lagrangians,
L = 1/2dx2 −V (x) ∈PhC.
The corresponding dynamical system σ, deduced from the Lagrange equa-
tions, as above, is given by the force law,
d2x = ∂V
∂x ,
and is of order 2, so the algebra of interest is,
C(σ) = PhC = k < x, dx >≃k < x1, x2 > .
Notice that the classical Hamiltonian H := dx2 −L, is not an invariant, i.e.
δ(H) ̸= 0.
Let us ﬁrst compute the particles in rank 1 for some cases, and let us
start with V (x) = 1/2 x2, i.e. the classical oscillator. The fundamental
equation of the dynamical system is,
δ = [δ] + [Q, −],

86
Geometry of Time-Spaces
where, in dimension 1, the endomorphism Q obviously commutes with the
actions of xi, i = 1, 2. To solve the equation above, we may therefore forget
about Q, so we are left with the vector ﬁelds,
[δ] = ξ.
The space, Simp1(C(σ)), is just the ordinary phase space, Simp1(k[x, dx]).
Put as above, x1 := x, x2 := dx. We must solve the equations,
δ(x) =[δ](x) = [δ](x1)
δ2(x) =[δ](dx) = [δ](x2)
We can obviously pick,
δi = χi = ∂
∂x i,
so we must have
[δ] = ξ1
∂
∂x 1 + ξ2
∂
∂x 2.
In the case of the potential, V = 1/2x2, we get the equations,
x2 =[δ](x) = [δ](x1) = ξ1
x1 =[δ](dx) = [δ](x2) = ξ2
Therefore the fundamental vector ﬁeld is,
ξ = x2
∂
∂x 1 + x1
∂
∂x 2
i.e. we ﬁnd hyperbolic motions in the phase space, with general solutions,
x = x1 = r cosh(t + c), dx = x2 = r sinh(t + c)
which is what we expected.
In the case of the oscillator, V = −1/2x2, we get the equations,
x2 =[δ](x) = [δ](x1) = ξ1
−x1 =[δ](dx) = [δ](x2) = ξ2
Therefore the fundamental vector ﬁeld is,
ξ = x2
∂
∂x 1 −x1
∂
∂x 2
i.e. we ﬁnd circular motions in the phase space, with general solutions,
γ : x = x1 = r cos(t + c), dx = x2 = −r sin(t + c),
which is also what we expected.

Consider now the versal family restricted to γ,
˜ργ : k < x, dx >→Endγ( ˜V |γ),
and a state ψ(t) ∈˜V |γ. If Q, restricted to γ, is multiplication by κ(t),
(in physics, one usually puts κ(t) = ıκ), then the Schr¨odinger equation
becomes,
∂
∂tψ = κ(t)ψ
so that we should have,
ψ(t) = exp(
Z t
γ
κ).
This will turn out much nicer if we extend the action of k < x1, x2 > to
˜VC, and put Q, restricted to γ, equal to multiplication by ıκ. Then we ﬁnd
the reasonable result,
ψ(t) = exp(ı
Z t
γ
κ).
See again [19].
In the repulsive, resp. attractive, Newtonian case, with V = ±1/x, we
ﬁnd,
x2 =[δ](x) = [δ](x1) = ξ1
ϵ(1/x2
1) =[δ](dx) = [δ](x2) = ξ2, ϵ = +, −.
Therefore the fundamental vector ﬁeld is,
ξ = x2
∂
∂x 1 + ϵ(1/x2
1) ∂
∂x 2
with the classical solution,
x = ϵ(9/2)t2/3.
In higher dimensions, say in the case of our toy model H, of the Intro-
duction, this rank 1 theory reduces to the wave-mechanics of de Broglie.
Recall that there is a natural action of the Lie group, U(1) on Bo, and
therefore a natural complex structure on the tangent space TH. Consider
the trivial versal family,
Ph(H) →EndC(1)(C(1), C(1)),
where we may assume C(1) is a complex vector space. Any order 2 dynam-
ical structure deﬁned on H, will induce a vector ﬁeld in C(1) = Ph(H),

88
Geometry of Time-Spaces
which in the case of the Levi-Civita connection, considered as force law,
makes the integral curves geodesics. From this the Klein-Gordon equation
follows in a natural way, and in this context we may also discuss interference
and diﬀraction of light, see [20].
Example 4.3. Now let us go back to the case of A = k < x1, x2 >, the
free non-commutative k-algebra on two symbols, and the rank n = 2, see
(3.3). We found,
C(2) ≃k[t1, t2, t3, t4, t5].
locally, in a Zariski neighborhood of the origin. The versal family ˜V , is
deﬁned by the actions of x1, x2, given by,
X1 :=
 0 1 + t3
t5
t4

, X2 :=

t1
t2
1 + t3 0

.
The Formanek center, in this case, is cut out by the single equation:
f := det[X1, X2] = −((1+t3)2 −t2t5)2 +(t1(1+t3)+t2t4)(t4(1+t3)+t1t5).
and
trX1 = t4, trX2 = t1,
detX1 = −t5 −t3t5, detX2 = −t2 −t2t3,
tr(X1X2) = (1 + t3)2 + t2t5,
so the trace ring of this family is ,
k[t1, t2 + t2t3, 1 + 2t3 + t2
3 + t2t5, t4, t5 + t3t5] =: k[u1, u2, u3, u4, u5],
with,
u1 = t1, u2 = (1 + t3)t2, u3 = (1 + t3)2 + t2t5, u4 = t4, u5 = (1 + t3)t5,
and f = −u2
3 + 4u2u5 + u1u3u4 + u2
1u5 + u2u2
4. Moreover, k[t] is algebraic
over k[u], with discriminant, ∆:= 4u2u5(u2
3 −4u2u5) = 4(1 + t3)2t2t5((1 +
t3)2 −t2t5)2, and there is an ´etale covering,
A5 −V (∆) →Simp2(A) −V (∆).
Notice that if we put t1 = t4 = 0, then f divides ∆.
Example 4.4. Quantum ﬁeld theory for the oscillator, given by the La-
grangian, L = 1/2dx2 −1/2x2, and with the force law, d2x = x, in rank
2, is more diﬃcult.
Above we have found a (partial) versal family of
Simp2(Ph k[x]), over the versal base space C(2) = k[t1, ..., t5], given by,
x =

The fundamental vector ﬁelds will have the form,
[δ] =

with 5 unknowns, ξi, i = 1, 2, .., 5. Moreover,
Q =

,
with 4 unknowns qi,j, i = 1, 2, j = 1, 2. Now, recall that Q can only be
determined up to a central element from M2(C), i.e. we have 8 essential
unknowns, ξi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and (q1,1 −q2,2), q1,2, q2,1 in the two matrix
equations,
δ(x) = dx = [δ](x) + [Q, x]
δ2(x) = x = [δ](dx) + [Q, dx]
On the right hand side of the equations we have the terms,

Writing up the matrix for the corresponding linear equation, we ﬁnd
that the determinant of the 8 × 8 matrix turns out to be easily computed,
it is,
D = 2(1 + t3)(t2t5 −(1 + t3)2).

90
Geometry of Time-Spaces
Notice that D is a divisor in the discriminant, ∆= 4(1+t3)2t2t5((1+t3)2−
t2t5)2, see (3.5). Moreover we ﬁnd,
(q1,1 −q2,2) = D−1(−(1 + t3)(t2
1 + t2
4) + (t2 −t5)(t2t5 −(1 + t3)2 −t1t4))
q1,2 = D−1(2(1 + t3)(t1t2 + (1 + t3)t4)
q2,1 = D−1(2(1 + t3)(t4t5 + t1(1 + t3))
ξ1 = t2q2,1 −(1 + t3)q1,2
ξ2 = −t2(q1,1 −q2,2) + t1q1,2 + (1 + t3)
ξ3 = (1 + t3)(q1,1 −q2,2) + t1q2,1 + t5
ξ4 = t5q1,2 −(1 + t3)q2,1
ξ5 = t5(q1,1 −q2,2) + t4q2,1 + (1 + t3)
See that ξ1 = ξ4 = 0 imply,
((1 + t3)2 −t2t5)q1,2 = ((1 + t3)2 −t2t5)q2,1 = 0,
and, since we assume that ∆̸= 0, therefore, ((1 + t3)2 −t2t5) ̸= 0, and
so q1,2 = q2,1 = 0, this also implies that t1 = t4 = 0.
Therefore the
singularities of ξ are given, by,
t2 = −(1 + t3), t5 = +(1 + t3),
or, up to isomorphisms, uniquely, by the representation,
x =
0 1

corresponding to t1 = 0, t2 = −1, t3 = 0, t4 = 0, t5 = 1. Notice that in this
case we ﬁnd, in all ranks, that fℏ:= ρ(x + dx), is an eigenvector for [Q, −]
with f−ℏ= ρ(x−dx) so that N = f−ℏfℏis the quantum counting operator.
Let us pause a little, to compute the gradient of the action, S = Tr(L).
Since L = 1/2dx2 + 1/2x2, this is easy, and we ﬁnd,
S =1/2(t2
1+2t2(1+t3)+2t5(1+t3)+t2
4), ∇S =(t1, (1+t3), (t2+t5), t4, (1+t3)),
which, clearly is diﬀerent from the vector ﬁeld ξ above, see the Introduction.
But the singularities, obtained by solving ∇S = 0, for,

which is isomorphic to the singularitity for ξ, after the coordinate change,
a+ := 1/2(x+dx), a := 1/2(x−dx), with the same Hamiltonian Q. Notice,
however,that even though the Formanek center f, is non-vanishing, our
family is not good at this point. Since 1 + t3 = 0, the discriminant ∆= 0,
and so our family is not ´etale at this point.
Now, to ﬁnd the integral curves of the vector ﬁeld ξ, we must solve the
obvious system of diﬀerential equations, ∂ti
∂τ = ξi, i = 1, .., 5. It turns out
that we are mostly interested in the solutions for which there exists singular
point, corresponding to t1 = t4 = 0. If they exist they look like,
∂t1
∂τ = ξ1 = 0
∂t2
∂τ = ξ2 = −t2(t2 −t5)(2 + 2t3)−1 + (1 + t3)
∂t3
∂τ = ξ3 = 1/2(t2 −t5) + t5
∂t4
∂τ = ξ4 = 0
∂t5
∂τ = ξ5 = t5(t2 −t5)(2 + 2t3)−1 + (1 + t3).
And these equations are obviously consistent with the conditions t1 = t4 =
0.
Introducing new variables,
y1 = (t2 −t5)
y2 = (t2 + t5)
y3 = (2 + 2t3)
so that,
t2 = 1/2 (y2 + y1)
t5 = 1/2 (y2 −y1)
t3 = 1/2 y3 −1.
things look nicer. We ﬁnd,
ξ2 = −1/2 (y1 + y2) + 1/2 y3
ξ3 =1/2 y2
ξ5 =1/2 (y2 −y1)y1y−1

In the new coordinates the system of equations above reduces to,

The integral curves are therefore intersections of the form,
C(c1, c2) := V (y2
1 −y2
2 + y2
3 = c1) ∩V (y1y3 = c2).
Moreover, the stratum at inﬁnity, given by f = 0, where f is the Formanek
center, is now easily computed, in terms of the new coordinates it is given
as,
f = −1/16(y2
1 −y2
2 + y2
3)2
This shows that a particle corresponding to an integral curve γ := C(c1, c2),
with c1 ̸= 0 lives eternally, as it should. Its completion does not intersect
the Formanek center, the stratum at inﬁnity.
An easy calculation gives us, see Example (4.2),
16(y2

2 + y2
3)2 = −u2
3 + 4u2u5
y1y3 = 2(u2 −u5),
where the u-coordinates are those of the trace ring, see Example (4.2). The
integral curves of the harmonic oscillator will be therefore be plane conic
curves in the part of Simp2(Phk[x]), where ∆̸= 0, u1 = u4 = 0, given by,
u2
3 −4u2u5 = c3, (u2 −u5) = c4.
Here c3 ̸= 0, c4 are constants. Notice also that our special point, the singu-
larity for ξ, given by y1 = −2, y2 = 0, y3 = 2, sits on the curve deﬁned by
c1 = 8, c2 = −4, corresponding to c3 = 32, c4 = −2.
In the new, y-coordinates, the versal family of Simp2(Ph k[x]), lifted
to U(2), and restricted to t1 = t2 = 0, is given by,
x =

Moreover along the curve γ, deﬁned by c1 = 8, c2 = −4, which is given by
the equations,
y3 = −4y−1

1 + 16y−2

the vectorﬁeld ξ is given by,

or,
ξ = 3/4(y1 + 2)(y1 −2)y1

,
depending on which root we choose for y2 above. The corresponding time
along γ, is then given as, τ = −log(y1) + 1/2log(y1 + 2) + 1/2log(y1 −2),
respectively τ = 1/3log(y1) −1/6log(y1 + 2) −1/6log(y1 −2), both with a
singularity at y1 = −2, y1 = 2, corresponding to the same unique singular-
ity of ξ, in Simp2(Ph(k[x]). This shows that to reach the singularity, from
outside, would take inﬁnite time.
The versal family is not deﬁned at y1 = 0, see above.
Example 4.5. (i) We shall not treat oscillators in rank≥3, in general, but
only look at the singularities, in all ranks. This is all well known in physics,
see [2], section 16, although in most books in physics, it is treated rather
formally, in relation with the second quantiﬁcation and the introduction of
Fock-spaces, and their associated representations of the algebra of observ-
ables. We shall see that this second quantiﬁcation is a natural quotient of
the algebra of observables PhC, in line with the general philosophy of this
paper. Although we may work in a very general setting, we shall, as above,
restrict our attention to the classical oscillator L = 1/2dx2 −1/2x2), in
dimension 1.
As above we ﬁnd,
d2x = x
and the Dirac derivation has therefore,
a+ := 1/2(x + dx), a−:= 1/2(x −dx)
as eigenvectors, with eigenvalues 1 and -1 respectively. Since Ph(C) = k <
x, dx > is generated by the elements a+ := 1/2(x+dx), a−:= 1/2(x−dx),
it is clear that Planck’s constant ℏ= 1.
Notice also that the classical
Hamiltonian is given by,
Q := dx2 −L = 2a+a−.
Using the methode above it is easy to see that for any rank n = dimV , a
singular point v ∈Simpn(PhC) corresponds to a k < x, dx >-module V ,
with x and dx acting as endomorphisms X, dX ∈Endk(V ) for which there
exists an endomorphism, the Hamiltonian, Q ∈Endk(V ) with,
dX := ρ(dx) = [Q, ρ(x)] =: [Q, X]
X = ρ(d2x) = [Q, ρ(dx)] =: [Q, dX]

Let ψ0 be any eigenvector for Q with eigenvalue κ0. Since V is simple, the
family {am

−(ψ0) ̸= 0, we know
it must be an eigenvector for Q, with eigenvalue κ0 + (m −n). We can, by
adding λ1 to Q, assume that there is a basis for V of eigenvectors for Q,
with eigenvalues of this form. This means that Q can be assumed to have
the form,

Now to have the classical formulas, see ([2], p.377-380), we just have to

Then, introducing a base change, corresponding to an inner automorphism

Clearly, we cannot impose, [a−, a+] = 1, in ﬁnite rank. If, however, we
let n = dimkV tend to ∞, then we ﬁnd exactly the classical formulas
for the oscillator as in the second quantiﬁcation, see the reference above.
In particular it follows that [a−, a+] = 1 is the only relation between the
operators a−and a+ in this classical limit representation.
On the basis of the examples above, in particular Example (4.4), it
is tempting to conjecture that all integral curves of ξ are intersections of
hypersurfaces of Spec(C(n)), of the form Trξ(˜ρ(θ)) = const.. However,
this is not true, as we can see by going back to Example (4.3). Here we
have
A = k[x], A(σ) = PhA = k < x, dx >= k < x, y >, y = dx, δ = y ∂
∂x+x ∂
∂y .
There are only two obvious invariants, θ1 = x2 −y2, i.e. the Hamiltonian,
and θ2 = xy −yx. Moreover the universal family on C(2) = k[t1, .., t5], is
given by,
˜ρ(x) =
 0 1 + t3
t5
t4

, ˜ρ(y) =

t1
t2
1 + t3 0

.

96
Geometry of Time-Spaces
We ﬁnd, see (3.5), that the invariants expressed in the coordinates
(u1, ..., u5), looks like,
trace(˜ρ(θ1)) = −u1 −2u2 + u4 + 2u5
det(˜ρ(θ1)) =(u5 −u2 −u2
1)(u5 −u2 + u2
4) −u2
4u5 + u1u3u4 −u2
1u2.
det(˜ρ(θ2)) = −u2
3 + 4u2u5 + u1u3u4 + u2
1u5 + u2u2
4
det(˜ρ(θ1)˜ρ(θ2)) =0.
Recall from above that,
u1 = t1, u2 = (1 + t3)t2, u3 = (1 + t3)2 + t2t5, u4 = t4, u5 = (1 + t3)t5,
and,
ξ2 = −1/2 (y1 + y2) + 1/2 y3
ξ3 =1/2 y2
ξ5 =1/2 (y2 −y1)y1y−1
3 .
If we put t1 = t4 = 0, we ﬁnd the result of Example (4.3), namely
Tr(˜ρ(θ1)) = y1y3
= 2(u5 −u2),
det(˜ρ(θ1)) = 1/4(y2
1y2
3) = (u5 −
u2)2, det(˜ρ(θ2)) = −1/16(y2
1 −y2
2 + y2
3)2 = −u2
3 + 4u2u5. However, the
fact that det(˜ρ(θ1)˜ρ(θ2)) = 0 indicates that there are non-algebraic integral
curves sitting on an algebraic surface of A5. This is related to the problem
of hyperbolicity of complex algebraic surfaces. In fact, we see that any
integral curve of ξ = [δ] is sitting on an algebraic surface, and we may ﬁnd
one for which ξ have no singularities. Is the integral curve algebraic, or
may it be dense on the surface, in the Zariski topology? Exact conditions
on algebraic surfaces for being hyperbolic seems not to be known. Notice
moreover that the non-commutative invariant θ2 is essential in the integra-
tion of ξ in this case. Notice also that when A = k[x1, x2, x3], and if the
Lagrangian L = 1/2(dx2
1) + 1/2(dx2
2) + 1/2(dx2
3) + U, has a potential U,
such that ∂U
∂x ixj = ∂U
∂x jxi, i.e. concerns a central force, then the angular
momenta Li,j := xidxj −xjdxi, are constants, i.e. δ(Li,j) = 0, in rank
1, which of course have the classical consequences one knows. Combining
this with the representations discussed in the Example (2.1), (iii), we ﬁnd
interesting results, see next section.
Emmy Noethers theorem is, in this context, reduced to the following
observation. Suppose a non-trivial derivation, ξ of A(σ) ≃Ph(A) leaves
the dynamical structure of the versal family ˜ρ-invariant, i.e. suppose,
˜ρ([ξ, δ]) = 0.

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
97
Let δ and ξ correspond, via Theorem (4.2.1), to the derivations [δ], resp.
[ξ] of C(n), and to the Hamiltonians, Q, resp. Qξ. For all a ∈A(σ) we
must have,
˜ρ([[ξ, δ], a]) = [[ξ], [δ]](˜ρ(a)) + [[Qξ, Q], ˜ρ(a)].
In the singular case, i.e. when [δ] = 0, this proves that Qξ is a constant of
the theory.
Example 4.6. We might try to ﬁnd functions, or formal power series,
[n] ∈k[[τ]] such that the representation,

satisﬁy the fundamental dynamical equation,
δ = [δ] + [Q, −].
We may, of course choose [δ] :=
∂
∂τ as the generator of the vector ﬁelds on
the τ-line. We ﬁnd the following system of diﬀerential equations,
∂
∂τ fn + (f 2
n −f 2
n−1)fn = fn
∂
∂τ fn + (−f 2
n −f 2
n−1)fn = −fn
where fn :=
p
[n], and with boundary conditions,
fn(0)2 = n.

98
Geometry of Time-Spaces
These equations immediately lead to δ(fn) = 0, so to constant f ′
ns,
and therefore proves that the curve in Simpn(PhC) deﬁned by the family
{x(n), dx(n)} is transversal to the fundamental vector ﬁeld ξ. The introduc-
tion of the (p,q) commutators, and their treatment in physics, makes it pos-
sible to treat the fermions and the bosons in a common structure. Letting
the parameter q in the above family slide from 1 to -1, the q-commutator
[−, −]q changes from the ordinary Lie product to the Jordan product. The
computation above shows that this change takes place transversal to time,
i.e. instantanously!
Example 4.7. For the harmonic oscillator in dimension n = 2 we have
A = k[x1, x2], and, Ph(A) = k < x1, x2, dx1, dx2 > /([x1, x2], [x1, dx2] −
[x2, dx1]), and,
A(σ) = k < x1, x2, dx1, dx2 > /([x1, x2], [x1, dx2] −[x2, dx1], [dx1, dx2]).
Moreover, in rank 2 we ﬁnd a simple representation of A(σ), given by,
X1 =
1 0
0 0

, X2 =
0 0
0 1

dX1 =
0 −1

 0 1
−1 0

with,
[X1, dX1] = [X2, dX2] =
 0 −1
−1 0

.
Example 4.8. For the quartic anharmonic oscillator, given by L =
1/2 dx2 −1/4 αx4 we may easily compute the rank 2 and 3 versal fami-
lies. In rank 2 we ﬁnd that there is a one-dimensional singular family of
dimension 2 simple modules, with,
X =
0 αt3
t
0

, dX =
 0 −α2t5
αt3
0

, Q = X =
0 0
0 αt2

.
In rank 3 we ﬁnd that there are no simple singular module with correspond-
ing diagonal Hamiltonian. This may be one reason why the energy levels
of the quartic anharmonic oscillator is not known to the physicists.
Example 4.9. Now, let us consider the inﬁnite rank case. In particular we
may consider the representation given in the above example, when n =
dimkV tends to ∞.
Notice that this is given as the limit case of the
singular simple representation of the classical oscillator in dimension n,

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
99
with an obvious conjugation condition imposed. For k = R, we have a real
Planck’s constant which we obviously may assume equal to ℏ= 1.
Moreover, we now have, [a+, a−] = 1, and we have a representation of
Ph(C) onto the algebra F, generated by {a+, a−}. Notice that in each
ﬁnite rank, this algebra generate the whole Endk(V ). The commutation
relations is given by a classical formula,
am

−+ mn an−1

am−1
−
+ 1/2!m(m −1)n(n −1) an−2
+
am−2
−
+ 1/3!m(m −1)(m −2)n(n −1)(n −2) an−3
+
am−3
−
+ ...
and the Lie algebra f, of derivations of F are easily seen to be generated by
the derivations {δp,q}p,q, deﬁned as,
δp,q(a+) = ap
+aq
−, δp,q(a−) = −p/(q + 1)ap−1
+
aq+1
−
.
If we put, for m, n ≥0
χm,n := δm+1,n, χm := χm,0
then we ﬁnd the Witt-algebra, with the classical relations,
[χm, χn] = (n −m)χm+n.
Moreover we ﬁnd,
[χ0, χm,n] = (m −n)χm,n =: deg(χm,n)χm,n.
Clearly the Lie algebra Derk(F) has an ascending ﬁltration with respect to
the degree, deg, deﬁned above, and it is easy to see that the corresponding
graded Lie algebra g := gr(Derk(F)) has the following products,
[χp,q, χr,s] = (r −p + (s + 1)−1(r + 1)q −(q + 1)−1(p + 1)s)χp+r,q+s.
In particular the degree zero component of g is Abelian.
Example 4.10. Finally let C := R[x], and let C := C ⊗R C, and consider
some representation on V = C of Ph(C) = R < x, dx >. Clearly,
Ext1
C(V, V ) = 0,
but, in general,
Ext1
P h(C(V, V )
is inﬁnite dimensional.
(i) Consider the free particle, i.e. the dynamical system, σ given by,
L = 1/2 dx2, σ : δ2x = 0,

100
Geometry of Time-Spaces
and let V be deﬁned by letting dx act as the identity. Then we ﬁnd that,
[δ] = 0, Q = ∂
∂x.
This means that [δ] does not move V in the moduli space of V .
The
Hamiltonian Q deﬁnes time, and
exp(tQ)(f(x)) = f(x + t).
(ii) Consider the same dynamical system, and let V be deﬁned by letting
dx act as
∂
∂x. Then we ﬁnd that,
[δ] = 0, Q = ( ∂
∂x)2.
As above, [δ] does not move V in the moduli space. The Hamiltonian Q
deﬁnes time, and the time evolution looks like,
U(t, ψ) = exp(tQ)(ψ).
Introducing the Fourier transformed ˆψ, we obtain a time evolution given
by,
U(t, ˆψ) = exp(tp2)( ˆψ).
(iii) Consider again the harmonic oscillator, and let the representation V :=
k[x−1] be deﬁned by letting x act as multiplication by x−1, and dx act as
∂
∂x. Then we ﬁnd that,
[δ] = 0, Q = (x ∂
∂x).
As above, [δ] does not move V in the moduli space. The eigenvectors of
the Hamiltonian Q are the monomials x−n, n ≥0, with eigenvalues −n,
and the time evolution looks like,
U(t, x−n) = exp(−nt)x−n.
Notice that,
[x, dx] = x2,
as operators on V . Notice also that V in this case is not simple. It is,
however, a limit of the ﬁnite representations, Vn := k[x−1]/(x−1)n. The
representation V2 is given by the actions,
x =

dx =

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law

where we have chosen the basis {1, x−1} in V2. It is clearly not simple, but
it sits as a point at inﬁnity, t1 = t2 = 1 + t3 = t4 = 0, t5 = 1, for the
(almost) versal family,
x =

Example 4.11. Given a dynamical system, A(σ) and a versal family for
simple representations of dimension n. Let ξ be the fundamental vectorﬁeld
deﬁned on U(n). Recall Theorem (3.4.8) and Theorem (4.2.1). There is a
morphism of generalized schemes,
U(n) →Yn := U(n)/(ξ)
The quotient “spaces” Yn and Xn := Simpn(A)/(ξ) are orbit spaces, where
each orbit is a curve. Completing, when nessecary, U(n) and/or Simpn(A),
we may assume these curves complete. Restricting to an integrable part of
U(n), resp. of Simpn(A), we may then hope to ﬁnd natural morphisms,
Γn : Yn →M,
where M is the moduli space of the complete algebraic curves. Moreover,
Theorem (4.2.1) should produce a rank n bundle Vn on Yn, n ≥1, and
one might ask for conditions for the existence of universal bundles Un on
M, such that Vn = Γ∗
nUn.
These are questions related to vertex algebras (bundles), see e.g. [5].
There is a large literature on the subject. Seen from our point of view, the
hidden agenda of the vertex algebra framework, seems to be to construct the
relevant algebra A(σ) of observables for a given quantum (ﬁeld) theoretic
situation.
In our language, let t0 ∈Simpn(A(σ)) be a singularity for ξ. Consider
the Planck’s constant, ℏ(t0), and the corresponding operators, a+
i , a−
i
∈
A(σ), together with the vacuum state ω(t0) ∈˜V (t0) =: V (any ﬂat section
ω of ˜V along γ will produce a vacuum state), such that the action of A(σ)
induces an isomorphism,
k[a+
1 , ..., a+
r ] ≃V,
a situation that we have seen realized in the case of the harmonic oscillator
in dimension 1, but which is easily seen to generalize to any dimension, then

102
Geometry of Time-Spaces
there pops up a family of generalized vertex algebras. In fact, consider the
restriction of the versal family
˜ρ : A(σ) →EndC(n)( ˜V ),
to the integral curve γ through the point t0 ∈Simpn(A(σ)). It is singular
at t0, so parametrized with time, τ, the completion will produce a map,
Y : V = ˜V (t0) ≃k[a+
1 , ..., a+
r ] ⊂A(σ) →Endk(V ) ⊗k k[[τ]][τ −1],
see (3.6), which will be a kind of generalized vertex algebra. In particular,
the localization axiom of vertex algebras imply that ˜ρ(a+
i ) and ˜ρ(a+
j ) com-
mute, which here is obvious. Moreover we observe that the exponentiating
formula of Y.-Z. Huang, see [5], p.18, (16),
Y (a, t) = R(ρ)Y (R(ρ(t)−1a, ρ(t))R(ρ)−1,
for a ∈A, and for any ρ ∈Aut( ˆOγ,0) ≃Aut(C[[t]]), follows from Theorem
(4.2.3) above. We shall, hopefully, return to this in a later paper.
4.8
Clocks and Classical Dynamics
Going back to (4.5) General Quantum Fields, Lagrangians and Actions, we
shall study the 1-dimensional case from a diﬀerent perspective.
When we talk about a clock, we obviously do not talk about the clock.
We just think of a device that can measure the changes that we choose to
study, in a most objective way.
The western way of thinking about time is related to the old dichotomy;
the past that has been, and is no more, and the future that is not yet; split
by the present.
We are talking about 12-18 billion years after the Big
Bang, and maybe of an inﬁnite future for our Universe. Time is maybe
starting, but not necessarily ending. It has no structure, like space; it is
freely ﬂowing.
The measuring device must therefore (?)
be modeled by a one-
dimensional free particle, i.e. the line k[τ] with dynamical structure given
by d2τ = 0.
The eastern way of thinking about time has always been cyclical, life,
death, reincarnation, new death, etc. This way of viewing the world would
be more comfortable with a Big Crunch turning into a new Big Bang, and
so on.
The measuring device for this kind of time-notion might therefore be
a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator i.e. k[τ] with dynamical structure
d2τ = τ.

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
103
Our representations of a western clock in rank 1 is easy. We have a
k-algebra k < τ, dτ >with a one-dimensional automorphism, given by,
exp(tδ)(f)(τ, dτ) = f(τ0 + tdτ, dτ). In rank 2 we may look at the situ-
ation in (4.3), and we ﬁnd that the western clock has no singularities in
rank 2. It never stops, in contrast to what we found for the eastern clock,
see (4.3).
Let now A := k[τ], B := k[t1, ..., tm], and let the dynamical system σ
deﬁned on A be the Eastern Clock, and the dynamical system µ on B be
the free particle, so that A(σ) = Ph(A), d2τ = τ, B(µ) = Ph(B), d2ti =
0, i = 1, ..., n. A ﬁeld, φ : A →B, should be considered as a model for
the physical phenomenon that can be observed everywhere on Simp1(B),
having a value that oscillate, (real or complex situation). The equation of
motion for this ﬁeld is,
dφ(a) −φ(da) = [Q, φ(a)], a ∈A(σ), Q ∈B(µ).
Plugging in a = dτ, we obtain,
d2φ(τ) −φ(τ) = [Q, φ(dτ)],
in B(µ). In the representation Ham : B(µ) →B0(µ) = k[ti, dtj], this gives
us,
X
i,j
∂2φ
∂ti∂tj
kikj = φ,
where ki = Ham(dti), necessarily are constants, since d(dti) = 0. This
choice of vector k = (k1, ..., km), is now arbitrary, and corresponds to the
vector that pop up in physicists text, in Fourier expansions. We shall show
that this immediately leads to the quantized Klein-Gordon equation, but
ﬁrst we have to make clear where we are.
4.9
Time-space and Space-times
Go back to our basic model, Hilb2(E3) := H = ˜H/Z2, classifying the family
of pairs of points (o, x) of the Euclidean 3-space, E3. As above we shall
ﬁrst consider the structure of ˜H, before we extend the results to Hilb2.
Recall from the Introduction, that given a metric g on ˜H, there are two
3-dimensional distributions, normal to each other, one being the canonical
0-velocities, ˜∆, and the other being the light velocities ˜c. By deﬁnition, g
is the time, and it is easy to see that g ˜∆is the proper time of Einstein’s
relativity theory. The group of isometries of ˜H, leaving ˜∆stable, does not

104
Geometry of Time-Spaces
contain the Lorentz boosts, K = J 0,1, J0,2, J0,3. This, together with the
results of the section Connections and the Generic Dynamical Structure
explains the fact that K is not concerved, and why we do not use the
eigenvalues of K to label physical states, see [30],I, 2.4, p. 61.
Moreover, the tangent bundle T( ˜H), outside of ∆is decomposed into
the sum of the basic tangent bundles Bo, Bx, Ao,x, each of rank 2. Recall
also that Ao,x is decomposed into a unique 0-velocity, dual to < dt0 > and
a light velocity dual to < dt3 >. The sub-bundle So,x, given by the triples
(ψ, −ψ, φ) ∈Bo ⊕Bx ⊕Ao,x, in which the pair (ψ, −ψ) corresponds to a
light-velocity, is at each point of H a 4-dimensional tangent sub-space, with
a unique 0-velocity.
Consider the symmetry in ˜H, induced by the generator τ ∈Z2. The
tangent space of ˜H at the point t /∈∆is represented by the vector space
of pairs {(ξo, ξx)} where ξo is a tangent vector in the Euclidean 3-space at
the point o, and ξx is a tangent vector at the point x. Any such pair may
be written as,
(ξo, ξx) = (1/2(ξo + ξx), 1/2(ξo + ξx)) + (1/2(ξo −ξx), 1/2(−ξo + ξx)),
where the ﬁrst vector is in ˜∆, and the second in ˜c. Clearly τ leaves ˜∆ﬁxed
and is the multiplication by −1 on ˜c. τ also inverts chirality, and spin, since
the orientation of Bo, deﬁned by (o, x) is the the inverse of the orientation
of Bx deﬁned by (x, o).
Classically one deﬁnes the symmetry operators in Minkowski space, the
parity operator P, by multiplying the space-coordinates with −1, the time
inversion operator T, by multiplying the time coordinate with −1, and the
charge conjugation operator C, by multiplying the spin σ by −1. Identifying
˜c with the past light-cone in Minkowski space, we see that τ corresponds to
the transform (xo, x1, x2, x3) →(−xo, −x1, −x2, −x3), i.e. τ corresponds
to PT, so τ 2 = τPT = id. This suggests that τ is the charge conjugation
operator, but as we have seen it inverts both spin and the momenta in
light-direction, so it is (slightly?) diﬀerent from the classically deﬁned C,
see [30], I, (3.3), p.131.
Choosing a line l ⊂E3, the subscheme H(l) ⊂H, has a much simpler
structure than H. The sub-bundle So,x, restricted to H(l) can be integrated
in H, and we obtain a 4-dimensional subspace S(l) ⊂H, in which we choose
coordinates t0, dt1, dt2, t3, where dt0 and dt3 are as above, and dt1, dt2 are
dual coordinates for the transverse bundle, Bo, (isomorphic to the inversely
oriented bundle Bx), normal to l in E3.
This subspace S(l) of H may be identiﬁed with a natural moduli-
subspace M(l) ⊂˜H. In fact, let M(l) = {(o, x) ∈˜H| 1/2(o + x) ∈l}.

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law

Since o = 1/2(o + x) + 1/2(o −x), x = 1/2(o + x) −1/2(o −x), it is of
dimension 4, and contains H(l). At every point (o, x) ∈H(l) ⊂M(l) the
tangent space is easily identiﬁed with So,x, therefore identifying S(l) and
M(l), as spaces. However, the structure of M(l) is much richer than that of
S(l) ≃S(l)×A2. In particular, the actions of the gauge group are diﬀerent,
see (Example 4.14). See also the section Cosmology, Big Bang and all that,
for another characterization of S(l).
Moreover, the usual Minkowski space, is recovered as the restriction,
U(l), of the universal family U, to M(l). The metric is deduced from the
energy-function of M(l).
Now go back to (4.8) and substitute S(l) for B. We have two solutions
for φ, respectively, φ = exp(kt), φ† = exp(−kt), in the real case, and with
δ = ıd substituting for d, φ = exp(ıkt), φ† = exp(−ıkt), in the complex
case. Now, in S(l)(µ) the elements φ and φ† commute, but they do not
commute with dφ and dφ†. However, if we now look at the representation,
Wey : S(l)(µ) →Diffk(S(l)),
where we recall that,
Diffk(S(l)), = k < ti, dtj > /([ti, tj], [dti, dtj], [ti, dtj]i̸=j, [ti, dti] −1),
we ﬁnd, [dti, φ] = kiφ, [dti, φ†] = −kiφ†, and computing a little,
dφ = φ

In fact, let K := kt = P

d(Kp) = pKp−1dK + (1/2)(p −1)pKp−2L
φ = exp(K), φ† = exp(−K),
dφ = φdK + (1/2)Lφ, dφ† = −φ†dK + (1/2)Lφ†.
Put Q := P
i kidti, and see that in H, and so also in S(l), Q is the energy
operator, along l := k. A simple computation shows that,
φ†dφ = Q + 1/2L
φdφ† = −Q + 1/2L,

106
Geometry of Time-Spaces
and since φφ† = 1, also,
dφ†φ = −Q −1/2L
dφφ† = Q −1/2L.
This is, in essence, the quantized Klein-Gordon, as one ﬁnds it in new
textbooks on QFT, see e.g. [23]. Notice also that, from Example (4.3)
we know that the energy of this particle is given in terms of the number
operator, here we have, Q = −1/2(φdφ† + dφ†φ) = 1/2(φ†dφ + dφφ†).
Example 4.12. Newton’s and Kepler’s Laws
Let us study the geometry of H. Recall that ˜H →H, is the (real) blow
up of the diagonal ∆⊂H, where H is the space of pairs of points in E3.
Clearly any point t ∈H outside the diagonal, determines a vector ξ(o, x)
and an oriented line l(o, x) ⊂E3, on which both the observer o and the
observed x sits. This line also determines a subscheme H(l) ⊂H, see above
and [20], and in H(l) there is unique light velocity curve l(t), through t, an
integral curve of the distribution ˜c, and this curve cuts the diagonal ∆in a
unique point c(o, x), the center of gravity of the observer and the observed,
and thus deﬁnes a unique point ξ(t), of the blow-up of the diagonal, in the
ﬁber of ˜H →H, above c(o, x). Any tangent η := (η1, η2), η2 = −η1, of
H in ˜c, at t = (o, x), normal to l(t), corresponds to a light velocity, to a
spin vector, η1 × ξ(o, x), in E3, with spin axis, the corresponding oriented
line. The length of the spin vector is called the spin of η. We have shown
in [20] that there exists a metric on H which, restricted to every 3-space
c(t) −{c(o, x)}, has the form,
ds2 = dt2
3 + (1 + r−2)dt2
1 + (1 + r−2)dt2
2 −r−4(t1dt1 + t2dt2)2,
where we have chosen the coordinates such that dt3 corresponds to the
oriented line l(o, x), and dti, i = 1, 2, correspond to the spin-momenta,
assuming t3 ̸= 0. The nice property of this metric is the following. Consider
a spin momentum η := (η1, −η1) and its corresponding spin vector η ×
ξ(o, x) := (η1 × ξ(o, x), −η1 × ξ(o, x)) along the line l(t). Clearly the length
of this vector, when r = t3 is large, is just the classical spin. When r tends
to zero, η deﬁnes a tangent vector of the exceptional ﬁber of the blow up at
c(o, x), i.e. of the projective 2-space, and of the covering 2-sphere. And we
see that the length of η × ξ(o, x) tends to the length of this tangent vector
in the Fubini-Studi metric of P2.
To see what this may lead us to, we need a convenient parametrization
of ˜H. Consider, as above, for each t ∈˜H the length ρ, in E3, the Euclidean

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
107
space, of the vector (o, x). Given a point λ ∈∆, and a point ξ ∈E(λ) =
π−1(λ), the ﬁber of,
π : ˜H →H,
at the point λ, for o = x. Since E(λ) is isomorphic to S2, parametrized
by φ, any element of ˜H is now uniquely determined in terms of the triple
t = (λ, φ, ρ), such that c(t) = c(o, x) = λ, and such that ξ is deﬁned by the
line ox. Here ρ ≥0, see also the section Cosmology, Big Bang and all that.
Notice also that, at the exceptional ﬁber, i.e. for ρ = 0, the momentum
corresponding to dρ is not deﬁned.
Consider any metric on ˜H, of the form,
g = h1(λ, φ, ρ)dρ2 + h2(λ, φ, ρ)dφ2 + h3(λ, φ, ρ)dλ2,
where dφ2 is the natural metric in S2 = E(λ). It is reasonable to believe
that the geometry of ( ˜H, g), might explain the notions like energy, mass,
charge, etc.. In fact, we tentatively propose that the source of mass and
charge etc. is located in the black holes E(λ). This would imply that mass,
charge, etc. are properties of the 5-dimensional superstructure of our usual
3-dimensional Euclidean space, essentially given by a density, h(λ, φ, θ).
This might bring to mind Kaluza-Klein-theory. However, it seems to me
that there are important diﬀerences, making comparison very diﬃcult.
Here we shall just consider the following simple case, where
h1 = (ρ −h
ρ
)2, h2 = (ρ −h)2, h3 = 1,
where h is a positive real number. This metric is everywhere deﬁned, since
for ρ = 0, there are no tanget vectors in dρ direction. It clearly reduces
to the Euclidean metric far away from ∆, and it is singular on the horizon
of the black hole, given by ρ = h, which in H is simply a sphere in the
light-space, of radius h. Moreover it is clear that h is also the radius of
the exceptional ﬁbre, since the length of the circumference of ρ = 0, is
2πh. Clearly, the exceptional ﬁber, the black hole itself, is not visible, and
does not bound anything. However, the horizon bounds a piece of space.
Moreover, if we reduce the horizon to a point in H, then the circumference,
or area of the exceptional ﬁber, as measured using the above metric, reduces
to zero, and the metric becomes the usual Euclidean metric.
We shall reduce to a plane in the light directions, i.e.
we shall just
assume that S2 = E(λ), is reduced to a circle, with coordinate φ. This
is actually no restriction made, as is easily seen. Consider the Lagrangian

L = g, see (Example 4.1), we ﬁnd the Euler-Lagrange equations,

0 = δ( ∂L
∂dλ) −∂L
∂λ = 2d2λ
where λ = λ, as above.
We solve these equations, and ﬁnd,
d2ρ = −(
h
ρ(ρ −h))dρ2 + (
ρ2
(ρ −h))dφ2
d2φ = −2/(ρ −h)dρdφ
d2λ = 0.
This, of course, is the same solutions as what we would have found by
solving the Lagrange equation.
According to Example (4.1) the corresponding equations for the
geodesics in ˜H are,
d2ρ
dt2 = −(
h
ρ(ρ −h))(dρ
dt )2 + (
ρ2
(ρ −h))(dφ
dt )2,
d2φ
dt2 = −2/(ρ −h)dρ
dt
dφ
dt
d2λ
dt2 = 0.
where t is time. But time is, by deﬁnition, the distance function in ˜H, so
we must have,
(ρ −h
ρ
)2(dρ
dt )2 + (ρ −h)2(dφ
dt )2 + (dλ
dt )2 = 1,
from which we ﬁnd,
(dρ
dt )2 = ρ2(ρ −h)−2(1 −(dλ
dt )2) −ρ2(dφ
dt )2.
From the third equation, we ﬁnd that dλj
dt , j = 1, 2, 3, are constants,
and | dλ
dt | is the rest-mass of the system. Put K2 = (1 −| dλ
dt |2), then K is
the kinetic energy of the system. The deﬁnition of time therefore give us,
ρ−2(dρ
dt )2 = (ρ −h)−2K2 −(dφ
dt )2.

Put this into the ﬁrst equation above, and obtain,
d2ρ
dt2 = −hK2(
ρ
ρ −h)

(ρ −h)2 + (ρ + h
ρ −h)ρ(dφ
dt )2.
Assume now r := ρ −h ≈ρ, we ﬁnd,
d2r
dt2 = −hK2
r2
+ r(dφ
dt )2,
i.e. Keplers ﬁrst law. The constant h, i.e. the radius of the exceptional
ﬁber, is thus also related to mass. In fact, this suggests that mass, is a
property of the space ˜H. In this case it is a function of the surface of the
exceptional ﬁber, i.e. the black hole, associated with the point λ in the
ordinary 3-space ∆.
In the same way, the second equation above gives us Keplers second
law,
r(d2φ
dt2 ) + 2(dr
dt )(dφ
dt ) = 0.
Notice that with the chosen metric, time, in light velocity direction, is
standing still on the horizon ρ = h, of the black hole at λ ∈∆. Therefore
no light can escape from the black hole. In fact, no geodesics can pass
through ρ = h. Notice also that, for a photon with light velocity, we have
K = 1, so we may measure h, by measuring the trajectories of photons in
the neighborhood of the black hole.
Finally, see that if the distance between the two interacting points is
close to constant, i.e. if we have a circular movement, the left side of the
time-equation becomes zero, and we therefore have the following equation,
ρdφ = Kdt + hdφ,
which may be related to the perihelion praecicion.
Let us now go back, and consider, in this case, the generic dynamical
structure (σ), of the subsection Connections, and the Generic Dynamical
Structure, related to the above metric. Put ρ = t1, φ = t2, λ = t3, then the
Euler-Lagrange equations above give us immediately the following formulas,
Γ1
1,1 = h/ρ(ρ −h), Γ1
2,2 = −ρ2/(ρ −h)

[d1ti, tj] + [ti, d1tj] = 0.
Let A := k[τ] be the Western clock, with Dirac derivation d with d2τ = 0.
It is easy to check that the following relations actually deﬁne a dynamic

where ∇s is the space-gradient.
These are Maxwell’s equations, with electrical charge equal to ρ :=

∂t0
, and electrical current equal to j := ∇s.(∇.φ). The last two equations
are Bianchi’s equations and are trivial, given that we start with a potential.
In our language, we see that charge becomes a rest-mass, and rest-mass
a kinetic energy.
Notice also that in space-time coordinates our potential satisﬁes, ∇2φi =
0, which explains the extra conditions necessary in the classical case. A
classical free particle, clocked by a Western clock, is now, according to
Example (4.13) a ﬁeld

Then the equations above simply says the following,
B × ˙ψ + E.˙κ0 = 0, E. ˙ψ = 0.
Now let us denote by γ the curve deﬁned by κ = (κ0, κ1, κ2, κ3). Then in

the clock we are using, is P3

˙γ = m.v,
where the unit vector v is the velocity, and ˙ψ = mvspace, ˙κ0 = m.v0 :=

This is, basically, what one ﬁnds in any textbook in physics, see again
[23]. The mass, or relativistic energy of the test particle here is m, and the
charge density becomes a kind of relativistic energy density in the (unique)
0-velocity direction dt0, both measured with our clock. Notice that this
kind of rest-energy is the only energy or mass that we seem to be able to
observe via electromagnetic interaction. The missing two other 0-velocity
directions might hide black energy/mass? Notice also that v and therefore
a are just dependent upon the structure of H and the curve γ, not on the
clock.
With this done, one may consider the Weyl representation,
Ph(S(l)) →Diff(S(l)),
which simply means to introduce the new relations, [ti, d1tj] = 0, i ̸=
j, [ti, d1ti] = 1. Then, going about as above, in the case of the Klein-Gordon
equation, one obtains the classical quantization of Electro Magnetism, see
also the next Example.
For later use, see that the last formula is a kind of Schrødinger equation,
∂
∂t(ψ) = Q(ψ),
where Ψ ∈ΘS(l), and Q ∈EndS(l)(ΘS(l)).
Let us now go back to the section, Connections and the Generic Dynam-
ical Structure, and do all this via the interpretation of an electromagnetic
ﬁeld, as given, for a trivial metric, by the connection ∇, of the tangent
bundle ΘS(l),
∇δi = ∂
∂ti
+ Ai.
Here Ai ∈EndS(l)(ΘS(l)), in the above classical situation, are just func-
tions, acting as a diagonal matrix. Notice, however, that this connection
now has torsion.
As we have seen, there is a canonical associated representation, ρ∇, for
which the curvature is given by,
Fi,j := ρ∇([dti, dtj]) = ∂Ai
∂tj
−∂Aj
∂ti
.

Geometry of Time-Spaces
Since the metric is ﬂat, the generic dynamical system, (σ), will give us,
d2ti = −1/2
r
X
j=1
(dtj[dti, dtj] + [dti, dtj]dtj),
so we have, the force law,
d2ti = −

Fi,jdtj −qi,
where the vector q is the charge-current density. In this case we have,
qi = 1/2
r
X
j=1
∂Fi,j
∂tj
.
The Maxwell equations, the 2 ﬁrst non-trivial ones, are then equivalent
to,
q = ∇(∇A) −∇2(A).
We see here that the charge occur also in the equation of motion for ﬁelds.
It disappeared in the essentially commutative QF-version, presented above.
As in the case of general relativity, where the problem was to explain the
notion of mass, as a property of the geometry of the time-space, the problem
here is to explain how the notion of charge is related to the the geometry of
the same time-space. This will be treated in a forthcoming paper by Olav
Gravir Imenes, see also [8].
Now, consider any Lie group G, acting on a k-algebra A. The action
induces a homomorphism of Lie algebras,
η : g →Derk(A).
For a ﬁxed integer n, there is a versal family,
˜ρ : A →EndC(n)( ˜V ).
Any element χ ∈g, considered as a derivation of A, acts, according to
Theorem (4.2), like,
˜ρ(χ(a)) = [χ](˜ρ(a)) + [∇χ, ˜ρ(a)],
for a ∈A, and for some Hamiltonian ∇χ. This looks like a connection,
∇: g →Endk( ˜V ).
Clearly, the condition [χ] = 0 for all χ ∈g, implies that the action η
induces an A −g-module structure on ˜V ,
∇: g →EndC(n)( ˜V ),

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
117
as in [18], p.563. This means that ∇is a Lie-algebra homomorphism, and
that for all a ∈A, χ ∈g, ψ ∈˜V , we have
∇χ(˜ρ(a)(ψ)) = ˜ρ(a)∇χ(ψ) + ˜ρ(χ(a))(ψ).
In particular the curvature vanishes, i.e.
R(χ, η) := [∇χ, ∇η] −∇[χ,η] = 0.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that the sub-scheme,
C(n; g) := {c ∈Simp1(C(n))|∀χ ∈g, [χ](c) = 0},
is a sub-scheme of Simp(A : g), the non-commutative invariant space de-
ﬁned by the g-action.
In fact, what we do by imposing the conditions [χ] = 0, for all χ ∈g, is to
construct a slice in Simp1C(n) cutting all orbits of [g] at a single point. The
result is obviously an orbit space, for which there exist an essentially unique
A −g-module structure on the restriction of ˜V to C(n; g). In particular we
ﬁnd a Lie-algebra homomorphism,
∇: g →EndC(n;g)( ˜V ).
Conversely, if we start with some Lie-algebra homomorphism,
∇: g →EndC( ˜V ),
and a representation,
ρ : A →EndC( ˜V ),
we might hope to construct an action of g on A, such that for ξ ∈g, a ∈A,
ρ(ξ(a)) = [∇ξ, ρ(a)].This is, however, rarely the case.
Example 4.14. (Gauge Groups, Invariant Theory, and Spin.)
Above we have seen that Ph(H) and therefore also Ph(S(l)) are moduli
spaces of interest. We know that U(1) acts on the components Bo and Bx,
conferring a complex structure on the tangent bundle of H. Moreover, the
fundamental gauge group,
G := SU(2) × SU(3),
acts on the complexiﬁed tangent bundle of H, i.e. there is a principal G-
bundle ˜G deﬁned over H, acting on ΘH. Notice that if we choose a velocity
v, i.e. a directed line l in a tangent space of H, and the corresponding
Minkowski space-time deﬁned by this directed tangent-line, then the action
of G on the tangent space of this space-time, is trivially invariant under
Lorentz boosts, since it, of course, leaves H(l) ﬁxed. This suggests that

118
Geometry of Time-Spaces
if we had a natural extension of the action of ˜G to the non-commutative
algebra Ph(H) then the non-commutative orbit spaces:
I := Simp(Ph(H) : ˜G),
or
I := Simp(Ph(H) : ˜g),
would have been a prime target for mathematical physics, see [18]. However,
this seems not to be possible unless one gives up the commutativity of the
base space H. We shall therefore, at this moment, restrict ourselves to
a rather simple special case, which should be suﬃciently general for our
purpose.
Picking a line l ⊂E3 and, as above, considering the subspace S(l), we
see immediately that the trivial principal bundle, SU(2), as well as the
trivial su(2)-bundle (and therefore also the complexiﬁed su(2), isomorphic
to sl2(C)), acts on the restriction of the tangent bundle ΘH to H(l). SU(2)
and so also sl2(C) therefore also acts on the complexiﬁed tangent-bundle
of S(l).
The tangent bundle of H, restricted to H −∆decomposes as,
CBo ⊕CBx ⊕CAo,x,
and on the exceptional ﬁbers of ˜H, it decomposes as,
CCo × CAo × C ˜∆.
Restricted to S(l) these bundles are natural representation of su(2) on
CBo ⊕CBx, and of su(3) on C ˜∆. But, of course, su(2) acts trivially on
Ph(H(l)). The above discussion concerning invariant spaces imply that
we should be interested in I = Simp(Ph(S(l)) : su(2)) or the representa-
tion theory of Ph(S(l)) × U(su(2)), where U(g) is the universal enveloping
algebra of the Lie algebra g.
As an example, pick α ∈su(2) ⊂EndC(C2). Using the parity-operator
P, see the Introduction, it acts naturally on CBo and on CBx, as α and
−α, respectively. So it acts as,
γ0(α) =
α 0
0 −α

,
on the complex rank 4 vector bundle, CBo ⊕CBx, the sections of which
are the spinors of the physicists. Composed with the parity operator P,
γ(α) acts like,
γ(α) =
 0 α
−α 0

,

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
119
i.e. like Diracs representation.
Fix now a representation of su(2), given in terms of the generators,
α1 =
i 0
0 −i

, α2 =
 0 1
−1 0

, α3 =
0 i
i 0

,
the analogues of the Pauli matrices, and put, L = (α1, α2, α3).
Notice that,
picking the basis of CBo ⊕CBx given by e1
=
(1, 0, −1, 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0, −1), e4 = (1, 0, 1, 0), e5 = (0, 1, 0, 1), then e1, e2
correspond to light velocities, and e4, e5 correspond to zero velocities. Let
So,x be the subspace generated by the light-velocities e1, e2, and let Iox be
the subspace generated by the 0-velocities e4, e5, then the parity operator
P will permute So,x and Iox.
Any particle, i.e.
any simple representation of Ph(S(l)) ⋊U(su(2)),
is now canonically a su(2)-representation, as in classical quantum theory,
where one imposes such an action, a spin structure, and in particular a
Casimir element S := L2 ∈su(2), L2 = P α2
i . Notice also that we have here
a double situation, a spin structure for the action on the light-velocities,
Sox, and an iso-spin structure for the action on the 0-velocities, Iox. Let us
explain this a little better.
The Lie algebra su(3) has a 2-dimensional Cartan subalgebra h, and two
copies of su(2), g1, and g2. We may pick, in an essentially unique way, g1,
such that it leaves the dt0-direction of the tangent space invariant, together
with a non-zero element s ∈h ∩g1 ⊂h1, where the last Lie algebra is the
1-dimensional Cartan Lie-algebra of g1. We may, with an obvious matrix
notation, pick
s =
1/2
0
0 −1/2

,
and assume that h has a basis given by s and the element,
y =


1/3 0
0
0 1/3
0
0
0 −2/3

.
Physicists call s the isospin, and y the hypercharge. They are commonly
denoted Tz and Y , and of course, are dependent upon the choice of the
direction, l, and therefore of H(l). The common eigenvectors for s and y
are called quarks. They come as up-quark, as down-quark, or as strange-
quark. Obviously, there is room for far more strange and colorful occupants
of the tangent bundle of S(l), by combining the many observables that we
have at hand.

120
Geometry of Time-Spaces
If we consider the moduli space H = ˜H/Z2, see the Introduction, then
it is clear that the gauge group, Z2, maps Bo isomorphically onto Bx and
vice versa. Let f+ : Bo ⊕Bx →Bo ⊕Bx and f−: Bo ⊕Bx →Bo ⊕Bx be
the corresponding projections. Obviously we have,
{f−, f+} = 1.
We therefore have the 4-dimensional situation described in Grand Picture,
and we see that the generator Σ ∈Z2, not to be confused with the Parity
operator P discussed above, reverses spin and isospin, but conserves the
hypercharge. Notice that for a point in ˜∆the decomposition of the tangent
bundle of S(l) is diﬀerent. There we have,
T ˜
H,o′ = Co′ ⊕Ao′ ⊕˜∆,
where Co′ ⊕Ao′ are light-velocities, and here su(2) act only upon the ﬁrst
factor. Thus here we have no isospin, and no quarks! To end this sketch,
notice also that the metric g deﬁned on H, in Example (4.12), is very
similar to the Schwartzchild metric of a black hole, with horizon equal to
the exceptional ﬁbre. The area of this black hole horizon, bounding nothing,
as a function on ∆, is a candidate for mass-density of the Universe. See
also that the symmetry, i.e.
the gauge group, corresponding to points
in ∆is diﬀerent from the gauge group outside ∆. This is analogous to
deformation theory, where the automorphism group of an object sees a
spontaneous reduction along a deformation outside the modular stratum.
It therefore seems to me that, in this purely mathematical model, one might
ﬁnd a correlation between a notion of mass-distribution, and a kind of Higgs
mechanism.
Notice also that, introducing a metric on S(l) and picking the Killing
form on g, the procedure of the section Connections and the Generic Dy-
namical Law, will lead to equations of motion of Dirac type and generaliza-
tions related to the theory of weak forces. See a forthcoming paper of Olav
Gravir Imenes.
4.10
Cosmology, Big Bang and All That
In the paper [20], we discussed the possibility of including a cosmologi-
cal model in our toy-model of Time-Space. The 1-dimensional model we
presented there was created by the deformations of the trivial singularity,
O := k[x]/(x)2. Using elementary deformation theory for algebras, we ob-
tained amusing results, depending upon some rather bold mathematical

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
121
interpretations of the, more or less accepted, cosmological vernacular. Here
we shall go one step further on, and show that our toy-model, i.e.
the
moduli space, H, of two points in the Euclidean 3-space, or its ´etale cov-
ering, ˜H, is created by the (non-commutative) deformations of the obvious
singularity in 3-dimensions, U := k < x1, x2, x3 > /(x1, x2, x3)2.
In fact, it is easy to see that the versal space W(U), of the deformation
functor of the k-algebra U, as embedded in 3-space, contains a ﬂat compo-
nent (a room in the (commutative) modular suite, see [22]) isomorphic to
H −∆, and that the modular stratum (the inner room) is reduced to the
base point. Notice that we are working with the non-commutative model
of the 3-dimensional space. This is, of course, not visible in dimension 1,
and therefore not highlighted in the above mentioned paper.
The tangent space of the versal base H(U), of the deformation functor
of U, as an algebra, is given, see e.g. [14], by the cohomology,
TW (U), ∗= H1(k, U; U) = HomF (J, U)/Der,
where π : F →U, is a surjection of a (non-comutative) free k-algebra F
onto U, J = ker(π), and Der, the vector space of restrictions of derivations
δ ∈Derk(F, U) to J. Pick F = k < x1, x2, x3 >. One easily obtains a
basis, {αi,j
k }i,j,k for HomF (J, U), given in terms of the expression of the
values of any F-linear maps α ∈HomF (J, U),
α(xixj) =
X
k
αi,j
k ϵk,
where ϵk is the class of xk in U. This HomF (J, U), is the tangent space
of the mini-versal deformation space, W(U), of the imbedded singularity.
The k-vector space of derivations, Derk(F, U), is of dimension 9, but the
restrictions to J = (xixj) are given in terms of,
δ(xixj) = δ(xi)ϵj + ϵiδ(xj),
so that, with the notations above, δi,j
k
= δi if k = j, δi,j
k
= δj if k = i, and
δi,i
k
= 2δi if k = i, and 0 otherwise. In particular Der is of dimension 3,
determined by the values δi := δ(xi).
A point of H is an ordered pair (o, x) of two points o = (α1
1, α1
2, α1
3), x =
(α2
1, α2
2, α2
3). Consider now the sub vector space T(2) of HomF (J, U), gen-
erated by the linear maps deﬁned by,
α(xixj) = α1
i ϵj + α2
jϵi.
The expressions above show that Der ⊂T(2).
Moreover, the quotient
space, i.e. the subspace of the tangent space TH(U),∗, deﬁned by T(2), can
be represented by the maps,
α(xixj) = (α2
j −α1
j)ϵi,

122
Geometry of Time-Spaces
i.e. by the vectors ox in Euclidean 3-space. The Lie algebra of inﬁnitesimal
automorphisms of U, i.e. Derk(U, U) acts on the tangent space of T(2), as
follows. If δ ∈Derk(U), then for any α ∈T(2), we have,
δ(α)(xi, xj) = −
X
l
δl
iα1(xl)ϵj −
X
l
δl
jα1(xl)ϵi,
inducing a distribution ˜∆of H −∆, and leaving only 0 invariant, in the
tangent space of W(U) at the base point, ∗. This shows that the part of
the modular substratum of H(U), sitting in T(2) is reduced to ∗.
We may identify ∗, i.e. the singularity U, with the point αp
i = 0, i =
1, 2, 3, p = 1, 2, contained in ∆, but recall that the points of ∆do not sit
in ˜H. Moreover, the fact that the tangent space of ∗does not contain any
0-velocity vectors, proves that ∗is a ﬁxed point of the versal space W, and
therefore of ∆.
This shows that H −∆is a natural subspace of W(U), deﬁned by the
equations,
(xi −α1
i )(xj −α2
j) = 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3.
Notice that this system of equations is not equivalent to the commutative
algebra equations,
(x1 −α1
1, x2 −α1
2, x3 −α1
3)(x1 −α2
1, x2 −α2
2, x3 −α2
3) = 0
which gives us the set of pairs of unordered points in 3-space, i.e. part of
H.
Given any point t = (o, x) ∈˜H, there is a translation ω(o, x) ∈˜∆(t),
the meaning of which should be clear, translating the vector ¯ox so that its
middle point coincides with ∗. The length, ω of ω(o, x) is our Cosmological
Time.
For every point (o, x) ∈˜H there is a vector ξ ∈TU,0 = ˜c(∗) such that
¯ox is a translation by ω(o, x) of ωξ. We may express this by saying that
(o, x) is created by the tangent vector ξ of U at the cosmological time ω.
Since ∗is a ﬁxed point in ∆≃E3, the geometry of our space ˜H changes.
The natural symmetry (gauge) group operating on E3 is now G := Gl(3).
The action of g := lieG deﬁnes a distribution ˜g, in ˜H, which is diﬀerent from
˜∆. In particular , the diagonal group, K∗⊂G, generates a 1-dimensional
distribution, ˜ω ⊂˜g, in ˜H.
Notice that the subspace U(ω) ⊂˜H with a ﬁxed cosmological time
ω, is of dimension 5.
The tangent space of any point t ∈U(ω) has a
2-dimensional subspace, ˜β(t), normal to ˜ω(t), which is not a subspace of
˜∆(t).

Geometry of Time-spaces and the General Dynamical Law
123
The metric g deﬁned on ˜H may now be written,
g = λ(t)dω2 + g(ω)
Here g(ω) is the metric induced on U(ω).
Notice that the maximal distribution ˜c, the light-velocities is no longer
deﬁned solely in terms of the metric g.
Now recall that time, in our model, is the metric g. Therefore we may
look at the equations above as the following formula,
λ(t)dω2 = dt2 −g(ω)
where t is time. Cosmological time is therefore of the same form as Ein-
stein’s proper time. This should be compared with the Einstein-de Sitter
metric of the elementary cosmological model, see [27],
−g = du4 ⊗du4 −(R2(u4))
3
X
i,j=1
duν ⊗duν,
and the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, see [2],
−ds2 = dτ 2 = dt2 −R2(t)(
dr2
(1 −kr2) + r2dΩ2).
It seems to us, that our model has an advantage over these, ad-hoc, models.
Accepting Big Bang as the creator of space, via the (uni)versal family of
the primordial U, changes the geometry of ˜H. In this picture, the point
(o, x) =: t ∈˜H is created from ∗= U, via the tangent vector v := 1/ω ¯ox
in the tangent space of ∗= U, in the direction, deﬁned by the middle point
of (o, x = t), of ∆, and in the time-span deﬁned by the cosmological time
ω. This deﬁnes a half-line ¯∗t, extending from ∗through t ∈H.
The visible universe ,V(o), for ME=(o, o) should be the union of all
world curves of photons, leaving ∗, reaching ME. This should coincide with
the union of all solutions of the Lagrangian λ(t)dω2 = dt2−g(ω), or with the
corresponding geodesics of this non-positive deﬁnite metric. This implies
that the universe must be curved, just like the picture drawn in [20], page
262, suggests. In that paper we just worked with a 1-dimensional real space.
Never the less, the situation here, in our 3-dimensional picture, is basically
the same, complete with a Hubble-constant, that is not really constant, etc.
If we want a catchy way to express these basic properties of our model,
we might say that, U, the Big Bang, that created our (visible) world, is
equivalent to any center of the exceptional ﬁber in ˜H, which, of course does
not really exist, and so the inﬁnite small has the same structure as the
origin of the world, U.

124
Geometry of Time-Spaces
In particular, see Example (4.14), we ﬁnd that the symmetry brake
of our model for quarks, in S(l), where the su(3) symmetry is broken by
the unique 0-velocity dt0, now could have been made global, using the
cosmological distribution instead of dt0.
Making all this ﬁt with contemporary quantum theory and cosmology
is, however, not an easy task. There are serious interpretational diﬃculties
here, as well as in most papers we have seen, on cosmology.
We shall
therefore leave it for now, and hopefully be able to return to this later.

Chapter 5
Interaction and Non-commutative
Algebraic Geometry
5.1
Interactions
Given a dynamical system σ of, order 2.
A particle, ˜V , that we know
occured at some point t ∈Simpn(A(σ)), producing a simple representation
V := ˜V (t) will after some time τ have develloped into the particle sitting
at a point on the integral curve γ deﬁned by the vectorﬁeld ξ of σ, at
a distance τ in Simpn(A(σ)) (we are of course assuming the ﬁeld k is
contained in the real numbers).
Now, this may well be a point on the
border of Simpn(A(σ)), i.e. in Γn = Simp(C(n)) −U(n), where it decays
into an indecomposable, or into a semi-simple, representation, i.e.
into
two or more new particles {Vi ∈Simpni(A(σ), n = P ni}. What happens
now is taken care of by the following scenario: If the diﬀerent particles
we have produced are not interacting, each of the new particles should
be considered as an independent object, evolving according to the Dirac
derivation δ. However, if the particles we have produced are interacting,
we have a diﬀerent situation. Notice ﬁrst that for n = 1, we have a canonical
morphism of schemes,
Simp1(A(σ)) −→Simp1(A)
and a canonical vector-ﬁeld ξ in Simp1(A(σ)), the phase space.
Given
any point of Simp1(A), the conﬁguration space, and any tangent-vector
at this point, there is an integral curve of ξ in Simp1(A(σ)), through the
corresponding point, projecting down to a fundamental curve in the con-
ﬁguration space.
For n ≥2 the spaces Simpn(A(σ)) and Simpn(A) are, however, totally
diﬀerent and without any easy relations to each other.
Let now vi ∈Simpni(A(σ)), i = 1, 2 be two points of Simp(A(σ))
corresponding to representations V1, V2, maybe in diﬀerent components,
125

126
Geometry of Time-Spaces
and/or ranks. Consider their components, i.e.
the universal families in
which they are contained,
˜ρi : A(σ) −→EndC(ni)( ˜Vi)
The Dirac derivation, δ, deﬁnes derivations,
[δi] : A(σ) −→EndC(ni)( ˜Vi)
and
therefore also the fundamental vector-ﬁelds, ∂i ∈Ext1
A(σ)⊗kC(ni)( ˜Vi, ˜Vi),
and ξi ∈Der(C(ni)).
Deﬁnition 5.1.1. Let B be any ﬁnitely generated k-algebra. We shall say
that the components, C1 ⊆Simpn1(B), C2 ⊆Simpn2(B), or the corre-
sponding particles ˜Vi, i=1,2, are non-interacting if
Ext1
B(V1, V2) = 0, ∀v1 ∈C1, ∀v2 ∈C2,
where vi is the isoclass of Vi Otherwise they interact.
Suppose now that the points v1 and v2, sit in Simpn1(A(σ)) and
Simpn2(A(σ)), respectively. Physically, we shall consider this as an obser-
vation of two particles, ˜V1 and ˜V2 in the state V1 and V2, at some instant.
If the two particles are non-interacting, the resulting entity, considered as
the the sum V := V1 ⊕V2, of dimension n := n1 +n2, as module over A(σ),
will stay, as time passes, a sum of two simples.
If V1 and V2 interact , this may change. To explain what may happen, we
have to take into consideration the non-commutativity of the geometry of
PhA. In particular, we have to consider the non-commutative deformation
theory, see Chapter 3, and [16]. Consider the deformation functor,
Def{V1,V2} : a2 −→Sets,
or, if we want to deal with more points, say a ﬁnite family Vi, i = 1, 2, ..., r,
the deformation functor,
Def{Vi} : ar −→Sets,
and its formal moduli,
H :=


H1,1 ... H1,r
...
.
Hr,1 ... Hr,r

,

Interaction and Non-commutative Algebraic Geometry
127
together with the versal family, i.e. the essentially unique homomorphism
of k-algebras,
˜ρ : A(σ) −→


H1,1 ⊗Endk(V1)
... H1,r ⊗Homk(V1, Vr)
.
...
.
Hr,1 ⊗Homk(Vr, V1) ...
Hr,r ⊗Endk(Vr)

.
This is, in an obvious sense, the universal interaction. However, we need
a way of specifying which interactions we want to consider. This is the
purpose of the following, tentative, deﬁnition,
Deﬁnition 5.1.2. Given vi ∈Simp(A(σ)), i = 1, ..., r. An interaction
mode for the corresponding family of modules {Vi}, i=1,...,r, is a right
H({Vi})-module M.
An interaction mode is a kind of higher order preparation, see Chapter
2. It consists of a rule, telling us, for the given family of r points, vi ∈
Simpni(A(σ)) how to prepare their interactions. The structure morphism
φ : H({Vi}) →Endk(M), ﬁxes all relevant higher order momenta, i.e. φ
evaluates all the tangents between these modules, and by the Beilinson-type
Theorem, see Chapter 3, creates a new A(σ)-module.
In fact, an interaction mode induces a homomorphism,
κ(M) : A(σ) −→Endk( ˜V ),
where ˜V := ⊕i=1,...,rMi ⊗Vi.
Thus, we have constructed a new n-dimensional A(σ)-module, which
may be decomposable, indecomposable or simple, depending on the interac-
tion mode we choose, and, of course, depending upon the tangent structure
of the moduli space Simp(A(σ)).
Assuming the impossible, that our k-algebra of observables, A(σ), con-
sisted of all observables that our curiosity fancied. Assume moreover that
the notion of interaction mode, i.e. a right H(Simp(A(σ)))-module, made
sense, then we might talk about a QFT-theory of the UNIVERSE. The
piece-vise deﬁned curves, γ0, γ1, ..., γl, .., corresponding to successive choices
at each moment of decay, of a new interaction mode, and therefore of a new
integral curve in the relevant time-space SimpN(A(σ)), might be called a
history.
Determining the conditions for de-coherence, and the assignment of
probabilities for these choices, will be left for now. See [6], and [7]. The
problem of time, in this context, observed from inside or outside of the
universe, will also be postponed, maybe ´a la calendes grecques.

5.2
Examples and Some Ideas
Example 5.1. Let us consider the case of two point-objects interacting in
3-space. Go back to the Example (2.1), (iii), and let us look at two ﬁelds,
φ(i) : A0 := k[x1, x2, x3] →k[τ], i = 1, 2,
inducing,
Ph(φ(i)) : A := Ph(k[x1, x2, x3]) →Ph(k[τ]), i = 1, 2.
This corresponds to two curves γ(i), i = 1, 2, in the phase space, A,
parametrized by the same clock-time τ. Start with τ = 0, and let this
time correspond to the two points,
φ(i, 0) = vi := (qi, pi) ∈A, , i = 1, 2.
Let Vi := k(vi), i = 1, 2, assume q1 ̸= q2, and use (2.1)(iii), to ﬁnd that the
formal moduli of the family {V1, V2} of A-modules, has the form,
 
ˆAp1
< τ1,2 >
< τ2,1 >
ˆAp2
!
where τi,j is a generator for Ext1
A(Vi, Vj)∗≃k.
Since Homk(Vi, Vj) = k, i, j = 1, 2, we have a natural, versal family,
i.e. a morphism,
A →
 
ˆAp1
< τ1,2 >
< τ2,1 >
ˆAp2
!
,
An interaction mode between the two point-particles, deﬁned by φ(i), i =
1, 2, is now given by evaluating the τi,j, and expressing the two ﬁelds φi by
the corresponding morphism,
φ : A →
Ph(k[τ])
0
0
Ph(k[τ])

.
A force law should now be given by some elements,
ψi,j(τ) ∈Ext1
A(φi(τ), φj(τ)).
by, say, putting,
ψi,j(τ) = φ(i, j : τ) · ξi,j,
where ξi,j is the generator of Ext1
A(φi(τ), φj(τ)) found in (2.1), (iii).
In the general case, we need a notion of hypermetric to formulate a
reasonable theory of interaction. This will, I hope, be the topic of a forth-
coming paper.

Interaction and Non-commutative Algebraic Geometry
129
Example 5.2. Let us consider the notion of interaction between two par-
ticles, Vi := k(vi) ∈k[x1, ..., xr], i = 1, 2, in the above sense. Look at
the A0 := k[x1, ..., xr]-module V := V1 ⊕V2, i.e. the homomorphism of
k-algebras, ρ0 : A0 →Endk(V ), and let us try to extend this module-
structure to a representation,
ρ : Ph∞A0 →Endk(V ).
We have the following relations in Ph∞A0:
[xi, xj] = 0
[dxi, xj] + [xi, dxj] = 0
....

and, α0
i (r, s) := xi(r) −xi(s), r, s = 1, 2. Let, for q ≥0,
ρ(dqxi) =
 αq
i (1) rq
i (1, 2)

,
Now, compute, for any p ≥k,
[ρ(dkxi), ρ(dp−kxj)] =

and observe that,
[ρ(dpxi), ρ(xj)] + [ρ(xi), ρ(dpxj)] =

After some computation we ﬁnd the following condition for these matrices
to deﬁne a homomorphism ρ, independent of the choice of diagonal forms,

constants, with σ0 = 0 and σl of order l. By recursion, we prove that this

130

is true, for k ≤p −1, therefore rk
i (1, 2) = −rk
i (2, 1), and so the diagonal
elements above vanish, i.e.
rk
i (1, 2)rp−k
j
(2, 1) −rp−k
j
(1, 2)rk
i (2, 1) = 0.
The general relation is therefore proved if we can show that with the above

Notice that the relations above are of the same form for any commutative
coeﬃcient ring C, i.e. they will deﬁne a homomorphism,
ρ : Ph∞A0 →M2(C),
for any commutative k-algebra C. Now, consider the Dirac time develop-
ment D(τ) = exp(τδ) in D, the completion of Ph∞A0. Composing with
the morphism ρ deﬁned above, we ﬁnd a homomorphism,
ρ(τ) : Ph∞(A0) →M2(k[[τ]]),
where,
Xi := ρ(τ)(ti) =
 Φi(1) Φi(1, 2)

Interaction and Non-commutative Algebraic Geometry

This must be the most general, Heisenberg model, of motion of our two
particles, clocked by τ. Observe that the interaction acceleration Φi(r, s) is
pointed from r to s, just like in physics! The formula above, is now seen to
be a consequence of the obvious equality of the two products of the formal
power series, σ · (Φ0
i (1, 2)Φ0
j(1, 2)) and σ · (Φ0
j(1, 2)Φ0
i (1, 2)), just compare
the coeﬃcients of the resulting power series. What we have got is nothing
but a formula for commuting matrices {Xi}d
i=1 in M2(k[[τ]]), since for such
matrices we must have,
dn
dτ n [Xi, Xj] = 0, n ≥1.
The eigenvalues λi(1, τ), and λi(2, τ)) of Xi describes points in the space
that should be considered the trajectories of the two points under interac-
tion. This is OK, at least as long as we are able to label them by 1 and
2 in a continuous way with respect to the clock time τ.
If all coupling
constants, σn, n ≥0, vanish, then the system is simply given by the two
curves Φ(r) := (Φ1(r), Φ2(r), ..., Φd(r)), r = 1, 2, where d is the dimension
of A0. In general, the eigenvalues of Xi are given by,
λi(r) = 1/2 · (Φi(1) + Φi(2))
(−1)r1/2
p
(Φi(1) + Φ2(2))2 −4(Φi(1) · Φi(2) + σ2(Φi(1) −Φi(2))2),
for r = 1, 2. Clearly,
1/2(λi(1) + λi(2)) = 1/2(Φi(1) + Φi(2))
(λi(1) −λi(2))2 = (Φi(1) + Φ2(2))2 −4(Φi(1) · Φi(2) + σ2(Φi(1) −Φi(2))2)
= (1 −4σ2)(Φi(1) −Φi(2))2.
Denote by, λ(r) = (λ1(r), λ2(r), ..., λd(r)), r = 1, 2, the vectors correspond-
ing to the eigenvalues, and by,
o := 1/2(λ(1) + λ(2)) = 1/2(Φ(1) + Φ(2))
the common median, and put,
R0 : = |(Φ(1) −Φ(2)|
R : = |λ(1) −λ(2)|,
then
R =
p
(1 −4σ2)R0.
Choose coupling constants such that,
d2
dτ 2 R = rR−2,

132
Geometry of Time-Spaces
where r is a constant we should expect Newton like interaction. If σ ≥1/2,
the point particles are confounded, the eigenvalues of Xi become imaginary,
and the result is no longer obvious. If we pick σ =
q
1 −r2R−2
0 , the relative
motion will be circular, with constant radius r about o.
Example 5.3. Let B be the free k-algebra on two non-commuting symbols,
B = k < x1, x2 >, and see Example (2.14). Let P1 and P2 be two diﬀerent
points in the (x1, x2)-plane, and let the corresponding simple B-modules
be V1, V2. Then, Ext1
B(V1, V2) = k. Let Γ be the quiver,
V1 ←→V2,
then an interaction mode is given by the following elements: First the
formal moduli of {V1, V2},
H :=
k < u1, u2 >
< t1,2>
< t2,1>
k < v1, v2 >

,
then the k-algebra,
kΓ :=
k k
0 k

,
and ﬁnally a homomorphism,
φ : H −→kΓ
specifying the value of φ(t1,2) ∈Ext1
B(V1, V2). Since Homk(Vi, Vj) = k,
we obtain V = k2, and we may choose a representation of φ(t1,2) as a
derivation, ψ1,2 ∈Derk(B, Homk(V1, V2)), such that the B-module V = k2
is deﬁned by the actions of x1, x2, given by,
X1 :=
α1 1
0 α2

, X2 :=
β1 0
0 β2

,
where P1 = (α1, β1) and P2 = (α2, β2). V is therefore an indecomposable
B-module, but not simple. If we had chosen the following quiver,
V1 ←→ϵ1,2
ϵ2,1 V2,
where ϵi,jϵj,i = 0, i, j = 1, 2, then the resulting B-module V = k2 would
have been simple, represented by,
X1 :=
α1 1
0 α2

, X2 :=
β1 0
1 β2

.

Interaction and Non-commutative Algebraic Geometry
133
In general, if B = A(σ), where (σ) is a dynamical system with Dirac
derivation δ, any interaction mode producing a simple module V , thus a
point v ∈Simp(A(σ)), represents a creation of a new particle from the
information contained in the interacting constituencies.
Moreover, any
family of state-vectors ψi ∈Vi, produces a corresponding state -vector
ψ := P
i=1,... ψi ∈V , and Theorem (3.3) then tells us how the evolution
operator acts on this new state-vector. If the created new particle V is
not simple, the Dirac derivation δ ∈Derk(A(σ)), will induce a tangent
vector [δ](V ) ∈Ext1
P hA(V, V ) which may or may not be modular, or pro-
representable, which means that the particles Vi, when integrated in this
direction, may or may not continue to exist as distinct particles, with a
non-trivial endomorphism ring, or, with a Lie algebra of automorphisms,
equal to k2. If they do, this situation is analogous to the case which in
physics is referred to as the super-selection rule. Or, if [δ] ∈Ext1
A(σ)(V, V )
does not sit (or stay) in the modular stratum, the particle V looses auto-
morphismes, and may become indecomposible, or simple, instantaneously.
We may thus create new particles, and we have in Example (4.7) discussed
the notion of lifetime for a given particle. In particular we found that the
harmonic oscillator had ever-lasting particles of k-rank 2. If, however, we
forget about the dynamical system, and adopt the more physical point of
view, picking a Lagrangian, and its corresponding action, we may easily
produce particles of ﬁnite lifetime.
Example 5.4. Let, as in (4.6) A := PhA0 = k < x, dx >, with A0 = k[x]
and put x =: x1, dx =: x2. Consider the curve of two-dimensional simple
A-modules,
X1 =
0 1 + t
0
t

X2 =

t
0
1 + t 0

,
either as a free particle, with Lagrangian 1/2dx2, or as a harmonic oscillator
with Lagrangian 1/2dx2 + 1/2x2.
The action is, in the ﬁrst case, S =
1/2TrX2
2 = t2, and in the second case, S = 1/2Tr(X2
2 + 1/2X2
1) = 2t2.
Thus the Dirac-derivation becomes ∇S = t ∂
∂t, or ∇S = 2t ∂
∂t. Computing
the Formanek center f, see (3.6), we ﬁnd,
f(t) = t2(1 + t)2 −(1 + t)4.
The corresponding particle, born at t < 0, decays at t = −1/2, and thus
has a ﬁnite lifetime. Of course, the parameter t in this example, is not our

134
Geometry of Time-Spaces
time, and the curve it traces is not an integral curve of the dynamic system
of the harmonic oscillator, see (3.7). This shows that one has to be careful
about mixing the notions of dynamic system, and the dynamics stemming
from a Lagrangian-, or from a related action-principle.
Example 5.5. Suppose we are given an element v ∈Simp(A(σ)), and
consider the monodromy homomorphism,
µ(v) : π1(v; Simpn(A(σ))) →Gln(k).
If v is Fermionic, then there exist a loop in Simpn(A(σ)) for which the
monodromy is non-trivial. Assume the tangent of this loop at v is given by
ξ ∈Ext1
A(σ)(V, V ). Since this tangent has no obstructions it is reasonable
to assume that there is a quotient,
H({V, V }) →
 k f −
f + k

,
with f −f + = f +f −= 1. This would give us an A(σ)-module, with struc-
ture map,
A(σ) →

Endk(V )
f −⊗k Endk(V )
f + ⊗k Endk(V )
Endk(V )

,
i.e. a simple A(σ)-module of Fermionic type, see Chapter 4, Grand Picture
etc. Notice that, for a given connection on the vector-bundle ˜V , the correct
monodromy group to consider for the sake of deﬁning Bosons and Fermions,
etc., should probably be the inﬁnitesimal monodromy group generated by
the derivations of the curvature tensor, R.
In physics, interactions are often represented by tensor products of the
representations involved. For this to ﬁt into the philosophy we have followed
here, we must give reasons for why these tensor products pop up, seen
from our moduli point of view.
It seems to me that the most natural
point of view might be the following: Suppose A is the moduli algebra
parametrizing some objects {X}, and B is the moduli for some objects
{Y }, then considering the product, or rather, the pair, (X, Y ), one would
like to ﬁnd the moduli space of these pairs. A good guess would be that
A ⊗k B would be such a space, since it algebraically deﬁnes the product of
the two moduli spaces. However, this is, as we know, too simplistic. There
are no reasons why the pair of two objects, should deform independently,
unless we assume that they do not ﬁt into any ambiant space, i.e. unless
the two objects are considered to sit in totally separate universes, and then

Interaction and Non-commutative Algebraic Geometry
135
we have done nothing, but doubling our model in a trivial way. In fact, we
should, for the purpose of explaining the role of the product, assume that
our entire universe is parametrized by the moduli algebra A, and accepting,
for two objects X and Y in this universe, that the superposition, or the pair,
(X, Y ), correspond to a collection of, maybe new, objects parametrized by
A. This is basically what we do, when we assume that X and Y are of the
same sort, represented by modules V and W of some moduli k-algebra A,
and then consider some tensor product of the representations, say V ⊗k W,
as a new representation, modeling a collection of new particles. As above we
observe that the obvious moduli space of tensor-products of representations,
or of the pairs (V, W) is A ⊗A. But since these representations should be
of the same nature as any representation of A, this would, by universality,
lead to a homomorphism of moduli algebras,
∆: A →A ⊗A,
i.e. to a bialgebra structure on the moduli algebra A. This is just one of the
reasons why mathematical physicists are interested in Tannaka Categories,
and in the vast theory of quantum groups. For an elementary introduction,
and a good bibliography, see [10]. See now that, if A0 is commutative, and
if we put A = Ph(A0), then there exist a canonical homomorphism,
∆: A →A ⊗A0 A.
In fact, the canonical homomorphism i : A0 →Ph(A0) identiﬁes A0 with
the a sub-algebra of A⊗A0 A. Moreover, d⊗1+1⊗d is a natural derivation,
A0 →A ⊗A0 A., so by universality, ∆is deﬁned. Thus, for representations
of A := Ph(A0) there is a natural tensor product, −⊗A0 −. Thus, in (3.18),
the tensor product of the ﬁber bundles deﬁned on S(l),
PN := ˜∆⊗H ˜∆⊗H ˜∆,
is, in a natural way, a new representation of Ph(S(l)), the ﬁbers of which
is the triple tensor product,
(3) ⊗k (3) ⊗k (3)
of the Lie-algebra su(3). The representation PN therefore splits up in the
well-known swarm of elementary particles, among which, the proton and
the neutron, see (4.18). Notice, ﬁnally, that the purpose of my notion of
swarm, see [18], is to be able to handle a more complicated situation than
the one above. One should be prepared to sort out the swarm of those
representations of the known observables, that one would like to accept as
models for physical objects, and then compute the parameter algebra best
ﬁtting this swarm. This is, in my opinion, one of the main objectives of a
fully developed future non-commutative algebraic geometry.
