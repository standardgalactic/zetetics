MASTERING YOUR MIND
CHAPTER 1
MASTERING  
YOUR MIND
BY BRIAN TRACY
Your mind is more powerful than you can imagine. You have within 
you, right now, the ability to overcome all your obstacles, solve all your 
problems and accomplish all of your goals, just by bringing the power 
of your mind to bear on the important parts of your life. When you 
master your mind and your deep unconscious abilities, you will move 
ahead faster and achieve more in a shorter period of time than perhaps 
you could even imagine today.
One of the keys to great success in life is to become very good at what 
you do, and concentrate on getting better and better. As a result, you 
will earn more and more and you will eventually rise to the top of your 
field. You will enjoy the respect and esteem of the people around you 
and you will enjoy the wonderful financial rewards that go along with 
the commitment to excellence in our competitive market society.
When I was a young man, after struggling for many years, I learned 
two things that changed my life. The first thing I learned was that 
everyone has the capacity to be excellent at something. One of the most 
important responsibilities of adult life is for you to choose your “area 
of excellence” and then to throw your whole heart into that area for a 
sustained period of time until you emerge in the top 10% of your field. 
No one else can do this for you, and without this commitment and this 
achievement, you will never accomplish what you are truly capable of.

TRANSFORM
22
The second thing I learned, which was even more important, was that 
everyone who is in the top 10% today was once in the bottom 10%. 
Everyone who is today leading their field was once starting off at the 
back of the field. Everyone who was at the front of the line of life today, 
started off at the back of the line.
For many years, I studied the biographies and autobiographies of great 
men and women, especially men and women who started from humble 
beginnings and rose to positions of power, prestige and leadership in their 
chosen fields. I found that all of these people have certain characteristics 
and qualities in common. And I also found that all of these qualities are 
learnable over time, if you know what they are and you know the steps 
that you need to take, to instill these qualities in yourself.
The philosopher Aristotle wrote that the aims and purposes of education 
are primarily to instill values, virtues and qualities of thinking in the 
minds of young people. Aristotle said that if young people grew up 
with the right way to think and respond to the world around them, they 
would enjoy lives of great accomplishment, prestige and esteem in their 
societies.
But, he asked, what if you have reached adulthood and for some reason 
you were not taught the essential qualities and mental thinking skills of 
highly successful people? Well then, Aristotle taught, the way that you 
develop the qualities that you recognize you need is to practice those 
qualities in every situation where those qualities are called for.
The Greek word for this approach to self-development is “Praxis.” 
What the great philosophers, teachers and leaders found was that you 
can shape and sculpt your own character and personality by practicing 
the qualities that you most admire and aspire to having for yourself. For 
example, whenever you feel afraid in a particular situation, the quality 
of courage is required. If you practice being courageous, if you do the 
bold thing rather than the cowardly thing, you eventually develop the 
habit of courage in the face of fear and danger. And it is the same with 
any other quality.
The Law of Correspondence says that your outer world becomes a 
reflection of your inner world. The more that you develop and instill 
the key qualities of leadership and exceptional people into your own 
character and personality, the more your outer world of success, 

23
MASTERING YOUR MIND
achievement and esteem will reflect what is going on inside of you.
In this chapter, I will give you some ideas about three key thinking 
skills and introduce you to all of them for your own information. Just 
remember that it is practice that enables you to develop the skills, not 
merely the learning of them, hearing of them or reading about them.
Let me start for a moment with the primary reasons for success in a 
fast moving, rapidly-changing society. In my estimation, they are focus, 
concentration, flexibility and anticipation.
Focus means that you have the ability to develop absolute clarity about 
what it is you want and where you are going. The lack of focus leads to 
fuzziness and confusion, the primary reasons that people underachieve 
and fail in life. The principle of concentration, which I will develop a 
little bit later, means that you develop the ability to discipline yourself to 
concentrate single-mindedly on one thing, the most important thing, and 
to stay with it until it is complete. With this ability, you can accomplish 
virtually anything. Without this ability, you will always have to work for 
someone else who has it.
The quality of flexibility is considered to be the most important single 
quality for success in the 21st century. Flexibility means that you develop 
the mental agility to move quickly with the winds of change, like a long-
tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Since everything is changing 
dramatically at a speed that has never before been experienced, the 
quality of flexibility enables you to abandon old unworkable ideas and 
embrace the new – on your journey toward the top 10% and the high 
levels of accomplishment of which you are capable.
The fourth quality is that of anticipation. This is something that is 
now taught in business schools under the title of “Crisis Anticipation.” 
What this means is that you develop the ability to look down the road 
several months, or even several years, and accurately anticipate what 
is likely to happen both good and bad, if certain other things happen. 
By anticipating correctly, you also develop the ability to make plans 
and provisions to assure that you can maximize your opportunities and 
minimize any problems that occur.
As you can see, the qualities of focus, concentration, flexibility and 
anticipation are all attitudes of mind. They are all approaches to your 

TRANSFORM
24
life, people, work and relationships that enable you to be a master of the 
forces of change, rather than merely a victim of change.
The flipside of success, the reasons for failure, are primarily fuzziness 
or lack of focus, diffusion of efforts, lack of concentration, feelings of 
uncertainty, doubt, fear and anxiety. The reason that these qualities lead 
to underachievement is that they all diffuse your energies and disperse 
your attention. The inability to clarify your goals and objectives and 
concentrate single-mindedly on them, combined with fear and anxiety, 
causes you to drift endlessly, to go in circles, and never to accomplish 
anything worthwhile.
All growth in your personal character comes from your developing 
these new qualities that you need at a deeper and deeper level. In any 
group of people, the man or woman who is the most developed in terms 
of their qualities of character and personality will eventually rise to the 
top of that group. This must be your aim in everything you do.
The key principals of leadership and success that have been discovered 
in more than 3300 studies going back to 600 BC, are all qualities that 
you can program into your character as permanent guides for happiness 
and high accomplishment.
The first quality or principle is that of the “objective.” In military terms, 
as well as in business terms, the principle of the objective requires that 
you are absolutely clear about who you are, what you want, where you 
are and where you are going. 
The second principle of strategic thinking is the principle of the 
“offensive.” This means that you continue to move out boldly in the 
direction of your dreams. You continually strive “to go where no man 
has ever gone before.” You are intensely action-oriented and you make 
things happen rather than just waiting for things to happen.
The third principle or tool for mastering your thought is the principle 
of the “mass.” This refers of course to your ability to concentrate your 
talents and abilities single-mindedly on one thing at a time. We will talk 
about this in a minute.
The fourth principle is the principle of the “maneuver.” In military 
and business terms, as well as in your personal life, this refers to your 
ability to be creative, flexible, adaptive and adjustable to changing 

25
MASTERING YOUR MIND
circumstances. All great battles, all great sports contests, are decided by 
the ability of one party to maneuver faster and in a more creative way 
than the opponent. 
The fifth quality of superb thinking is the quality of intelligence. In 
military terms, this means to get all the information necessary about 
the positions and plans of the enemy before acting. In modern business 
terms, this means to understand the market thoroughly before launching 
new products and services. In personal terms this means that it is vital 
for you to become one of the most knowledgeable and skilled people in 
your field if you are going to enjoy the success that is possible for you.
The sixth quality or principle of success is “singleness of command.” In 
military terms, this means that there is one person in charge. In business 
terms, this means that there is a clear hierarchy of command and control 
within an organization. Each person reports to only one person. In 
your personal life, this means that you are absolutely single minded in 
pursuit of your goals and objectives, rather than trying to pursue several 
different goals at the same time.
The seventh principle of success is that of “surprise.” In military terms, 
this means that the successful general always does something that is 
completely unexpected and unanticipated by the enemy. In business 
terms, this means that you are always innovating and developing new, 
creative ways of attacking your marketplace. In your personal life, the 
principle of surprise is demonstrated when you move boldly out of your 
comfort zone and try completely different things from what you have 
done in the past. You know that “The more you do of what you’re doing, 
the more you’ll get of what you’ve got.”
The eighth principle is that of “exploitation.” In military terms this means 
aggressive follow-up and follow-through. In business this means that 
you sell all you can. You develop your markets fully. You do everything 
for your customers that you can possibly do, leaving nothing to chance. 
In your personal life, this means that you are totally committed to the 
full development of every aspect of your personality and your character. 
You never stop growing and becoming more and better.
The ninth principle is that of “security.” In military terms security refers 
to the need to cover your base, to protect your back, to establish proper 
arrangements to assure that you are not caught off-guard by your enemy. 

TRANSFORM
26
In business terms, this means that you never take a risk that you cannot 
afford to take, and that you continually do everything possible to assure 
the happiness and satisfaction of your best customers so that nothing 
happens to your business and to your cash flow.
In your personal life, the principle of security refers to your plans to 
adequately insure and provide against any untoward things that could 
happen to you or your family.
The tenth principle is the principle of “economy.” In military terms, 
this means that you accomplish your objectives with the lowest possible 
expenditure of men and resources. In business terms, this requires that 
you are continually looking for ways to get the same results at the lowest 
possible cost. In personal terms, the principle of economy means that 
you are always looking for ways to achieve more with less, to reduce 
your costs of living and to do things in the most efficient way.
The eleventh principle of advanced thinking is the principle of 
“simplicity.” In military terms, this means that the most effective plans 
are those that are the simplest and the least complicated to carry out. In 
business, the principle of simplicity demands that you always look for 
faster, easier, less complicated ways to achieve the same objective. In 
your personal life, the principle of simplicity can apply to many things, 
especially to simplifying your life so that you are doing a few things 
well rather than attempting to do many things, and doing many of them 
poorly.
These eleven principles are all vital to high achievement. The absence 
of any one of these principles can, in itself, be detrimental and even fatal 
to all your hopes. 
All great business accomplishments are also based on the same eleven 
principles. Whenever you see a small business that grows rapidly and 
becomes a large business, you will find all eleven principles at work. 
Whenever you find an average person who begins to accomplish 
extraordinary things and achieve a wonderful life, you will find that 
they are consciously or unconsciously using all of these principles to a 
reasonably high degree. 
We are living in an age of incredible opportunity and possibilities for 
the average person. Everything that you could ever want to know or 

27
MASTERING YOUR MIND
want to become, you can learn by clearly specifying it in advance and 
then going to work on yourself and your situation. There are virtually 
no limits to what you can acquire, as long as you are clear about what it 
is you really want.
This brings us back to the first principle, the principle of the objective. 
The principle of the objective is the starting point of all great victories 
against overwhelming odds. And this does not simply refer to 
generals leading armies into battle. It refers to any entrepreneur, sales 
professional or businessman who is selling products and services in a 
highly competitive market.
I was discussing this principle with a group of entrepreneurs recently. 
I explained that all great victories are those that are won against 
overwhelming odds by superior thinking and deployment of resources. 
I then asked if they had any competition for their products or services in 
the local market. They all saw immediately that each one of them was 
competing with dozens, if not hundreds of other companies, all of whom 
were striving to get the same business. They were in the position of 
military commanders who were greatly outnumbered by vastly superior 
forces, fighting valiantly for market share, sales and profitability every 
single day. And you are exactly the same.
The principle of the objective means that you know exactly what it is 
you want to accomplish.
Some of the best questions that you can ask yourself repeatedly are 
questions such as, “What are you trying to do?” and, “How are you 
trying to do it?”
Asking yourself these questions, especially when things are not working 
out the way you anticipated, will help to clarify and focus your mind and 
thinking on your real objectives. “What are you trying to do and how 
are you trying to do it?” Another question you can ask to clarify your 
objectives is, “What are your assumptions?” “What are your conscious 
and unconscious assumptions? What are you assuming about the current 
situation that may or may not be true?”
Sometimes, people assume that, when they are negotiating with a 
customer for a product or service, the customer actually wants to buy 
the product or service from them. In reality, the customer could be 

TRANSFORM
28
negotiating with you for the sole reason of getting a lower price that 
he or she can use to buy the product or service that they want to from 
another company. What are your assumptions?
The rule is that errant or incorrect assumptions lie at the root of every 
mistake. What would you do, how would you change what you are 
doing if your current assumptions were wrong? What if the product or 
service that you are selling is not really appropriate for your current 
marketplace? What if your product or service was either overpriced or 
undervalued with the features and benefits needed by the marketplace 
today? If your product or service did not have the ability to achieve 
meaningful, competitive advantage in a tough market, what courses 
of action would that dictate to you and your company? What are your 
assumptions?
Another part of the principle of the objective is for you to think through 
who you really are. This is one of the most important questions you’ll 
ever ask and answer, and accuracy is absolutely essential. Who are you? 
What do you believe in? What are your values? What do you stand for? 
What will you not stand for?
High performance only comes when your goals and plans on the outside 
are consistent and congruent with your values and beliefs on the inside. 
Since you always accomplish on the outside what is consistent with the 
person you are on the inside, it is very important that you take the time 
to be absolutely clear about who you are, on the one hand, and what you 
really, really want on the outside. Only in this way can you master your 
mind and bring all your mental powers to bear on achieving on a high 
level.
Remember, the reason that most people fail is because they are fuzzy or 
unclear about what it is they really want and who it is they really are. 
Here’s a question for you. What one great change would you make in 
your life today if you won a million dollars cash, tax free, in the lottery?
If you suddenly received a windfall of one million dollars cash, what 
would you do differently from what you are doing today? Whatever 
your answer to that question is, it can be very revealing in terms of what 
it is you really want, what it is you really believe in, what you stand for 
and most especially, the areas where you may be compromising yourself 

29
MASTERING YOUR MIND
because of your perceived financial needs. How would you change your 
life if you had all the time and money in the world today?
The second principle I want to talk about is the principle of “intelligence.” 
This means, as former President and CEO of ITT Corp., Harold Geneen 
said, “Get the facts!”
Geneen said that it was essential for you to get the real facts, the absolute 
truth, rather than the apparent facts, the assumed facts, the hoped-for 
facts or the wished-for facts.
Jack Welch, the former President and CEO of General Electric, perhaps 
one of the finest executives in America, says that the most important 
principle for leadership and high achievement is “The Reality Principle.” 
The Reality Principle means that you see the world as it is, not as you 
wish it. You find out the actual reality of a situation before you make a 
decision.
The great majority of people in our society live in a world of delusion. 
They have wishes, hopes, fantasies and illusions about themselves and 
their world. Fully 90% of the population considers themselves to be 
in the top 10% of the population in terms of personality, intelligence, 
ability to influence others and attractiveness. Most people are highly 
deluded. However, this is not for you. Your starting point must be the 
solid foundation of truth and reality. You must absolutely refuse to 
delude yourself in any area.
The principle of intelligence means that you learn everything you need 
to learn about your work and your field. You read continually. You 
listen to audio programs in your car. You take additional courses. You 
subscribe to all the magazines and newsletters in your field and you read 
them from cover to cover.
The principle of intelligence means that you never stop learning, 
growing and absorbing new information and ideas in your field, because 
you know that one key idea is all that you need to give yourself a critical 
advantage in a competitive marketplace.
The third principle, the principle of the mass, or concentration, is the 
ability for you to set absolutely clear priorities on everything you do. The 
principle of concentration means that you have the ability to separate 
the vital and urgent from the unimportant and irrelevant. You have the 

TRANSFORM
30
ability to decide, in advance, the most important things that you could 
possibly be doing. You then have the discipline to do only those things 
until they are complete. 
You have the willpower and mental strength to not give in to the 
temptation to clear up small things first. You always work from a list and 
you set priorities on the list before you begin. You always work on your 
highest value activities. You define the areas of your work and your life 
that are most important to your long-term success and you concentrate 
single-mindedly on those until you have mastered them and completed 
them.
The principle of concentration is so important that you cannot study it or 
practice it enough. You always ask yourself, “What is the most valuable 
use of my time right now?” 
Every single day, you look into yourself and ask, “What can I, and only 
I, do, that if done well, will make a real difference?”
There are certain things that only you can do, and if you do them well, 
they will make a real difference to your life and work. Of course, if you 
neglect to do them, they will not get done and no one else will do them.
You have within you the mental abilities to accomplish extraordinary 
things. You have the ability to sit down and calmly think through your 
goals and objectives. You have the ability to develop absolute clarity 
about who you are and where you are going, and then to work in only 
those areas until you achieve the great things of which you are capable.
You have the unlimited ability to develop your intelligence to an 
extremely high level. You can learn anything you need to learn to 
achieve any goal you can set for yourself. You can develop any skill that 
can help you to move ahead more rapidly in your life. You can acquire 
any level of information. It is up to you to devote your life to continuous 
learning, because you know that continuous learning is the minimum 
requirement for success in any field.
Finally, you have the ability to concentrate single-mindedly on the most 
important things you can possibly do to achieve your goals. You have 
developed the self-discipline to hold your own feet to the fire. You have 
the inner resolve and the tenacity to stay with a major task until it is 
100% complete. You know that, if you have every skill but the ability 

31
MASTERING YOUR MIND
to finish your most important jobs, that all of your other skills will be 
ineffective.
This is a great world for us to live in. There have never been more 
opportunities or possibilities for you and I than exist today. But, 
throughout history, the men and women who have accomplished great 
things are those who have developed themselves to very high levels. The 
good news is that we all start off lacking these qualities and abilities. 
The even better news is that we can all learn and develop these qualities 
by clearly identifying them and practicing them until they become 
automatic. And when you master your mind and practice the principles 
of success practiced by the great men and women in history, your future 
will become unlimited.

INTENTIONAL TRANSFORMATION
CHAPTER 2
INTENTIONAL  
TRANSFORMATION
BY PAT STANGL
As an attorney, I take great pleasure in knowing I am able to help people 
through some of the most difficult times in their lives. Often, it’s a time 
of change and transformation for them – a new lease on life so to speak. 
In my law practice I often hear things like, “I did not do what they say I 
did.” “I am not guilty of what I am charged with…I will lose my job if…
My spouse will leave me if…My reputation will be ruined if…” That 
is, if there is a conviction. These feelings spoken in a time of confusion, 
fear and emotional turmoil by clients who are charged with a crime, 
hang like a storm-laden cloud over their heads and are commonplace in 
my business, the business of being a trial lawyer devoted to defending 
those accused of crimes. I reassure them, “It will be OK; we’ll get 
through this.” As I look them in the eye I confidently state, “If you hire 
me I will do everything I can to help you.” 
It is vitally important for my client or potential client to truly feel my 
drive, determination and desire to help them and to provide them with the 
best possible representation. It is the same in any business, the customer 
must know that you care, they must know your passion for your given 
profession or line of work, and they must feel your commitment to them. 
First, however you must believe in yourself, because if you don’t it will 
show and no one else will have confidence in your competence – no 
matter how good you may be at something. 

TRANSFORM
34
Anytime you deal with people, you have the potential to influence their 
life and help them transform. I would like to share with you four very 
important principles that have allowed me to achieve a great deal of 
success in the people-helping business. 
I. INTENDING GREAT RESULTS
When you have confidence in yourself and your particular skill set, 
you naturally and instinctively intend good results for your client and 
customers. The word intention can be defined broadly as a plan or a 
purpose. You plan on something happening, i.e., I plan to go to a movie 
this evening or my purpose is to get the best results for my client. When 
we think of intention, we often picture a kind of dogged determinism 
where we bite onto something, never letting go until we achieve the 
result we intend. 
However, Dr. Wayne Dyer in his seminal book, The Power of Intention, 
defines intention differently; not as a dogged determinism but rather 
as a spiritual or energy source that can be harnessed to co-create your 
life. You can utilize this energy of intention to transform your business 
to achieve great results for your clients or customers. How do you do 
this? First, you need to get crystal clear about what it is you want to 
intend or achieve. Second, you need to take massive action; actually do 
something about it. If you want to achieve a particular result, you must 
take steps to manifest that intent. Intending a particular result is great, 
but without the right action it is a non-starter. Break down the goals 
which you intend to achieve into smaller achievable pieces and then 
build on those gains. Finally, you have to steadfastly believe and never 
waiver in that intention. You may suffer setbacks or it may seem that 
whatever you are intending isn’t working or will never work, but you 
must continue to focus on that intention and think and act as if it has 
already happened. Visualize the new client or customer, visualize the 
new relationship, visualize the courtroom victory. The old saying, “As 
you think, so shall you go.” is never more relevant than when dealing 
with the creative power of intention. 
Let me give you an example. The year was 1993 and I was officially 
a lawyer for a little over two years when I started my own law firm. 
Mind you, I had no office, no money and no clients and, despite some 
experience in federal court, I had yet to try a federal case. That year 

35
INTENTIONAL TRANSFORMATION
I was appointed by the court to represent a defendant in a federal 
fraud prosecution. My client was charged with submitting a false 
loan application for a federal loan by pledging collateral which was 
encumbered, meaning the collateral was not legally-owned outright by 
him. My client, a hardworking humble farmer, believed in good faith 
based upon representations made and documents provided to him by a 
cattle dealer, that he had in fact owned the collateral. However, through 
sleight of hand the seller retained legal ownership. The problem was 
my client signed the loan application and written in small print above 
the signature line was a statement that warned that it is a violation of 
federal law to make a false statement in a loan application. By signing 
the application the applicant was representing that the information 
provided in that application was true.
Now what? He signed the application and it was materially false. The 
case looked like a sure thing for the prosecution. I ran the case past 
my colleagues and the consensus was the same, don’t try the case 
because you have no chance; plead him guilty and try to get him the 
best sentence. Yet, I couldn’t. He was innocent. My client was steadfast 
and believed wholeheartedly that he owned the cattle. Indeed that was 
what he was told and if someone gives you their word and shows you 
legal papers it means something. In his mind it was simple; he did not 
submit a false loan application. The only chance we had was a good 
faith reliance defense – which luckily, under the charging statute, was a 
viable defense. Yes, we had a legal defense but that was a million miles 
away from a sure acquittal. Although at the time I didn’t understand 
intention as I do today, looking back on that case I definitely intended 
a great result for my client. Despite the odds and what appeared to be 
all but a certain conviction for the government, I believed in my heart 
we could win. I wanted to win. I had to win or a great injustice would 
have occurred, an innocent man would have been convicted and sent to 
federal prison. 
What did I do? Over the legal proceedings which ensued, piece by piece, 
bit by bit, I took massive action. I studied the Rules of Evidence like 
never before. I investigated. I interviewed witnesses. I dug. I read and 
then read more. I spent many late nights at the law library preparing for 
trial. I assiduously planned and wrote every question for each witness for 
direct and cross examinations, for my opening and my closing, and then 
I let go. I intended to win that case. I was confident I was as prepared 

TRANSFORM
36
as possible for trial. That is, as prepared as I could be for a lawyer with 
only one previous trial, an acquittal in state court. All I could do was 
everything I did for my client up to that point. After all, it was not my 
decision that would determine that humble farmer’s fate. 
We went to trial and as any trial goes it was a battle, up and down. My 
client testified and I was able to attack the credibility of the government’s 
witnesses and the individual who sold the purported unencumbered 
cattle to my client. The case went to the jury. It was the longest wait 
of my client’s life. The jury came back and the verdict was read. Not 
guilty! Looking back 20 plus years after the fact, it is clear to me that 
I intended a great result for that farmer and I applied massive action to 
that never wavering intent. Yes we had a few breaks along the way, but 
that is what can and will happen if you use the powerful energy force of 
intention to intend great results in your business and personal life. 
II. MASTERING YOUR CRAFT
The word “master” has many definitions but the one most applicable 
to one’s chosen profession or business is a person who is highly 
skilled or proficient or a person who has a particular expertise. I don’t 
know if anyone ever truly masters their craft because when someone 
is a master it implies that there is nothing more. You did it, that’s it. 
Rather, it is the intent to master one’s craft, coupled with the desire 
for incessant improvement that results in proficiency and becoming 
highly skilled with a high level of expertise. Michelangelo once said, 
“If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery; it wouldn’t seem 
so wonderful at all.” Simply put, there are no shortcuts or quick fixes. It 
requires commitment, very hard work and yes, there is that word again, 
“intention.” 
So how do you intend to become a master of your craft? Here are some 
guidelines. I suggest you read and absorb everything you can about your 
profession or business. You must make and take the time to learn and 
improve. In my field I am always reading books about trial tactics and 
strategies in addition to all the reading that is required in a trial practice 
including keeping up on changes in the law. As you work on becoming a 
master or expert in your field, learn from the best in your field and those 
who have gone before you. Attend seminars and conferences where 
the most successful people in your field will be speaking. Ask a lot of 

37
INTENTIONAL TRANSFORMATION
questions. People who excel at the highest levels in their field didn’t get 
there by themselves and I have found they are more than willing to help, 
to answer questions and provide insight and guidance. 
III. EXPERIENCE MATTERS
Pursuing the dream of mastering your craft requires time, practice and 
sacrifice. If you truly want to become the best in any field, you must 
make choices about how you spend your time. The only way to gain 
experience is to dedicate yourself to your work in your area of practice 
for an extended period of time. The trial I told you about earlier occurred 
over twenty years ago and since then I have tried many cases and in 
each of those cases I have worked to improve and master my craft but it 
is the collective experience of those individual cases which has pushed 
me further down the winding road on my journey of intending to master 
my craft. 
Let me give you an example of the importance of experience. I recently 
tried a difficult case where my client was charged with driving while 
under the influence. While I intended to achieve a great result and win 
the case there were significant hurdles to overcome and I am not afraid 
to say we needed a little luck on our side. Indeed, the arresting law 
enforcement officer would testify that my client was driving a vehicle, 
registered to him, which he followed for approximately two blocks as 
he drove erratically through a hotel parking lot and exited onto a city 
street. After he stopped the vehicle my client allegedly alighted from 
it and took off running. My client insisted he was not the driver but 
rather his vehicle was being driven by an acquaintance he had met that 
evening who happened to be wearing a similar long sleeved shirt. I 
knew from handling hundreds of criminal cases that statements made 
by an officer in a police report and that officer’s sworn testimony do not 
always match up with the physical evidence in the case. 
While the State had a circumstantial case that put my client behind 
the wheel I hoped that what little physical evidence existed, namely 
the dispatch logs and photographs would show something different. I 
obtained the dispatch logs and they showed that the arresting officer 
never made his initial call into dispatch to report the incident of him 
following the vehicle until later that evening in direct contradiction of 
his trial testimony. Moreover, the officer could have activated his in 

TRANSFORM
38
squad camera and captured the whole event but inexplicitly did not. The 
same officer had taken numerous photographs of my client’s vehicle 
but careful attention to detail demonstrated the photographs were taken 
before, not after, the initial dispatch call was made. Armed with the 
dispatch tape and the photographs, which the prosecution elected not to 
use, I waited patiently. On cross-examination, I was able to demonstrate 
that the officer was clearly mistaken about the events of the evening – 
which brought his whole testimony into question. Was his story about 
what had happened credible? The jury didn’t think so and my client was 
acquitted of the drunk driving charges. My point is that there is simply 
no substitute for experience when it comes to the hard work of intending 
to master your craft. 
IV. VALUE RELATIONSHIPS
Because of the 1993 case I mentioned earlier, I developed a professional 
relationship with the judge in that proceeding. It was a unique relationship 
because he had a reputation of being extremely hard on attorneys in the 
courtroom. He would seemingly pick on certain attorneys and I think 
he could sense their fear. If you were intimidated by him in any way, he 
knew it. Most attorneys did not like going in front of him but I loved it, 
and it seemed to all develop from that first trial I had with him. 
In all the cases that I appeared before him after that initial trial, he 
knew I was always well prepared and he respected that. He would still 
“let me have it” every once in a while, because that’s just how he was. 
He actually ended up helping me in that first trial when I was a young 
lawyer. You see, when you’re a young lawyer, it’s sometimes difficult to 
form questions that aren’t objectionable. So, a lot of my initial questions 
were being objected to because they weren’t in the proper form. He 
essentially did me a favor by calling counsel up to the bench and giving 
me a tip. He said, “The questions counsel is asking are relevant and 
appropriate, they just need to be phrased in a different way.” That was 
a real learning experience that helped me in that particular case as well 
as in the hundreds of other cases in which I would subsequently be 
involved, and I will never forgot the value of what he did. 
Appearing in front of that judge was not something most other attorneys 
valued. But, it’s important to see the value and contribution of every 
person in your realm of connections. Learn from others, even if they are 

39
INTENTIONAL TRANSFORMATION
hard to understand or get along with. Value your relationship with them 
as well as with those that are more pleasant. Relationships give you 
the opportunity to grow and transform and also enable you to help and 
influence others so they can grow and transform. 
My experience has shown me that transformation takes place when we 
•	 Intend Great Results 
•	 Master Our Craft 
•	 Gain and Use Our Experience 
•	 Value Relationships 
By practicing these principles, Transformation is inevitable.

CHAPTER 3
PEOPLE ARE  
THE CATALYST
BY LOU RAY ROBINSON
What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, 
but what is woven into the lives of others.   
~ Pericles
 
My road to West Point and ultimately as a coach and mentor has been an 
interesting one filled with increasingly transforming experiences across 
the globe. Growing up, I consistently faced people telling me what I 
could or could not do. Those encounters shaped me into a person driven 
to lead others to their best in spite of any obstacle. My journey started 
the year I was born, when my mother, a retired Army E-8, joined the 
Army. She was a single mother and I was the oldest of three. I held 
things together at home while she worked long hours giving us a greater 
opportunity than she had growing up poor. During our journeys across 
the globe, she stressed very important themes I have carried with me 
throughout my life: 
1) Go to school, get good grades, go to college or join the Air Force 
2) Nothing is more important than family, and 
3) Take care of each other no matter what. 
As long as I can remember, I’ve been taking care of people. I watched 
over my sisters, protected the bullied, tutored, and led, managed, and 

TRANSFORM
42
encouraged hundreds of people, creating plans for organizations around 
the globe. Creating these bonds to partner with others in their growth 
has been the core of my being my entire life. By the age of 18, I had 
lived in seven states and three countries. Adapting to such change in my 
life afforded me the increased opportunity to meet and help a diverse 
crowd of people and caused significant self-transformation. 
At my third high school, I met a West Point cadet and one of many 
challenges to what I was capable of accomplishing. Instead of getting 
to know who I was on the inside, this fellow JROTC cadet did not 
like my outward achievements and told me I would never make it at 
West Point. I never planned to apply as I had aspirations to become 
an FBI agent not an Army Officer. Nevertheless, to prove him wrong, 
I did, and a recruiter convinced me that West Point was my best path 
to the agency. I joined the Law Enforcement Tactics Club, the Rifle 
Drill Team, became a powerlifter, and after being on the Color Guard, 
became Captain of the Color Guard in my final year. Before graduating 
with a B.S. in Computer Science, I tutored and guided many in math 
and computers. As an officer, I inspired soldiers to many achievements, 
led the officer strength-building program, and built long lasting 
relationships with many across the globe. Promotions led me to varying 
experiences including leading a team responsible for the entire fiber 
backend in Korea, and supporting military intelligence operations at 
Fort Hood, TX. I led teams of ten, thirty, and a hundred people. In each 
experience, I practiced and developed my relational skills. My military 
experience led me to the Pentagon as a member of the global strategic 
planning team for the Air Force Chief Technical Officer. Here I found 
myself training officers and continuing my passion to help people. It is 
during my time at the Pentagon that I decided to pursue more formal 
mentorship training. I decided to pursue a Master’s degree to develop a 
roadmap to help others achieve their aspirations. 
Even at such a high level in my career, I continued to face judgments 
from others who assumed that just by looking at me, I could not be a 
representative in a group of high ranking civilian officials. I happen 
to be far more diverse than what labels like Veteran, or Army Officer 
or West Pointer might say about me. One boss told me he never met a 
West Pointer he liked. Later, he retracted his statement. I happen to be a 
Seminarian preparing for Ordainment (the initial path I took to develop 
my passion for mentorship) and receive questions about how I could be 

43
PEOPLE ARE THE CATALYST
a soldier and a minister simultaneously. In many contexts people assume 
who I am, where I belong, or what I can do or am capable of – based 
on a label. At eighteen, an adult who should have been encouraging 
and mentoring me asked me why I, as an African-American, would join 
an Army for a country that did not accept us. I simply told her if one 
of us does not try to succeed, how could any of us? Once, I met either 
Simon or Garfunkel, who asked me how I could be a woman in the 
military. As a peace promoting team, I can only assume they asked for 
that reason. At the Pentagon, a Colonel wrote me a seven-page letter 
detailing how women could not preach. I honestly respect that he cared 
that much to mentor me, but he was wrong in two cases. Not only was 
my goal to counsel soldiers which Army Chaplains do 80% of the time, 
he was incorrect in his reasoning. We can be pretty strong too! I recall 
amazement at my ability to do seventy-two push-ups and ninety sit-ups 
in two minutes in the military, and I would always respond with the fact 
that my mother could do 100 push-ups in two minutes far surpassing me! 
Maybe when you read about my West Point or military experiences you 
thought I was a woman. Maybe you thought I was strong. Maybe neither 
crossed your mind. Maybe it was strange for you to hear that I was in 
seminary or thought it was strange someone would dare tell me who I 
couldn’t be. Even as a 0.01% minority at West Point in the 90s, I was 
hired at the Pentagon by a 1972 graduate and found myself making the 
same assumptions that I have encountered in my career while I looked 
for a tall blond haired blue-eyed interviewer who was a minority himself. 
No affiliation can fully define the whole of who I am, who anyone is nor 
what you or I can offer. Moving from place to place and working with 
people from all around the globe, transformation was continuous. I have 
overcome adversities and learned from my failures and successes to get 
the results I have achieved. These experiences helped me understand 
people at a deeper level and, as a result, I developed a specific skill set 
that has given me the ability to guide people towards their personal 
goals and synch them with their organization’s goals. This linkage is 
one of the cornerstones to sustainable organizational success regardless 
of size, profit or non-profit status, or location.
There was an important lesson in my own false assumptions teaching 
me to help people learn more about who I really am by getting to know 
who they really are. I started to teach others how to do the same as it is 
in the resulting relationship that organizations can finally create passion 

TRANSFORM
44
within people to drive towards organizational goals. Most people can 
resonate with what my family tried to teach me about taking care of 
others. The bonds formed in healthy or strong relationships are the 
bonds that cause people to rally behind each other and support each 
other in the good times and bad. If there is a person or group of people in 
your life that will back you up or that you would back up or help through 
most storms, that connection is the type of bond that helps drive teams, 
and thus, organizations on towards their vision.
This is the message for this chapter. As you try to maintain control 
of your business or whatever goal you are pursuing and you let those 
goals control or guide your path to success, there is a cornerstone to 
success that must accompany you on that path. Without it, the ground 
you gain can be for naught when you find yourself searching for the 
missing tool that will clear the rest of your path to success. That tool 
is the skill that builds mutually supportive relationships with people 
whose relationships will carry you through your journey. The practice 
to effectively build relationships on a deeper level with others is a skill 
you must continuously build. These experiences can leave leaders blind 
to diverse thoughts, innovations, or hidden contributions that we never 
tap into as leaders focus on the business and forget to grow people and 
grow with people. Therefore, in summary of my experiences above, 
I have defined five simple points you can refer to along your path to 
achieving your goals. These points will help you maintain the type of 
relationships that will allow you to tap into a wealth of insight, support, 
and sustainable actions that you can build 
your goals upon:
1.	Be in Communication with the people 
around you to start to get to know who 
they are and what diverse ideas they 
can contribute to the overall goal in 
partnership with you.
2.	Be in Connection with the wants and 
needs of others and, as much as you 
can, provide for those needs, showing 
them that who they are matters—
igniting the will to support the very 
organization (family) that supports them.

45
PEOPLE ARE THE CATALYST
3.	Be the Encouragement people need to do great things so that you can 
maintain that connection.
4.	Be in Collaboration with the people you work with, especially those 
that work for you, inspiring their need to feel like they are a part of 
accomplishing something great and, thus, tap in to what each person 
can uniquely offer.
5.	 In Compromise, be willing to settle. If, for example, you can get 
three of your top five by giving others three of their top five, then go 
for it, creating a win-win situation that strengthens that bond you are 
trying to achieve with others.
Whether you find yourself at the very bottom of an organization or at 
the top, at home, or even in a short-term relationship you can apply 
these five points. This is a long-term, life-long strategy you implement 
on your team, in your organization, or in your group. Remember, in the 
toughest of times they will always follow who they believe in, because 
in consistently implementing these five points over time you give them 
the passion to act and partner with you. They will have your back, and 
in giving what they can give of themselves, you will find the missing 
ideas, innovations, or work ethic that will take you to that next level. No 
one can believe in a person nor follow that person around blind corners 
if they cannot connect. Connection is the precursor to trust. People are 
social beings and must be able to connect with others on some level 
in order to gain trust. Communication, connection, collaboration, and 
compromise cannot occur if you treat a person as if they are expendable 
and treat your interaction with them as a temporary necessity on your 
way to achieving your goals. Not only can you destroy their spirit 
to stand behind you, the mission, or the task at hand, it can cause an 
unexpected detour when you arrive on top with no one to sustain you 
there. Compassion is not on my list because I cannot teach you to have 
compassion for others as this comes from within. If you are a person of 
compassion, combine what you have learned about compassion to the 
points. If you are not, learn and apply some of the key concepts from 
key writings about transformational or spiritual leadership. The best 
instruction I have found in this area comes from authors Jim Kouzes 
and Barry Posner in their 1999 work Encouraging the Heart: A Leader’s 
Guide to Rewarding and Recognizing Others. 
These skills are only a catalyst of success. You must build strengths in 

TRANSFORM
46
the other pillars of leadership success that you will find as you study 
and practice other transformational leadership skills. As you continue 
to develop your relational skills with others consider that ultimately 
supporting the greater good of others will ultimately rally others 
towards your own goals. Some may get lost in imitation thoughts that 
they alone created their success. Success cannot be sustained alone. 
Life was not meant to be tackled alone. Woven fabrics are strong 
because of how they are interlaced, and so the same with what results 
from mutually-supporting relationships. I have learned not to linger in 
any discouragement resulting from those who are not receptive to my 
attempts to connect. Every attempt to connect or build relationships 
may not be successful, however, as a long-term plan, the amount of 
successes will give you the stepping stone for the support you need. Use 
connection failures as opportunities to build your relational skills. As I 
have found great success in helping others achieve their own goals, I 
hope that my insights will help you because as you help others achieve, 
you will achieve.

FROM CATERPILLAR TO BUTTERFLY: MY LIFE-CHANGING TRANSFORMATION
CHAPTER 4
FROM CATERPILLAR  
TO BUTTERFLY: 
MY LIFE-CHANGING  
TRANSFORMATION
BY JANETTE GLEASON
January 4, 2010, I remember the day vividly. Our Christmas tree was still 
up in our living room, evergreen wreaths and other decorations adorned 
our walls, and new toys sprinkled the rooms in our house. While the 
kids were still basking in the glow of their Christmas wishes coming 
true, I held anxiety in the pit of my stomach, but tried to keep a happy 
face. With the economic uncertainty, our family-owned small business 
(financial planning and tax preparation) took a hit like many other small 
businesses across the country at that time. Christmas was anything but 
merry for me that year. With our debt climbing from medical bills, 
household expenses and small business needs, I was overwhelmed 
with wondering how we would manage to keep it all going. As a stay-
at-home mom, it started to bother me that I couldn’t contribute to my 
family’s financial stability. 
As I went about caring for our three young children and keeping our 
house in order that day, a man knocked on our front door. Deep down I 
knew who it was, but I didn’t want to face the music. Keeping my chin 
up, I opened the door and awaited the bad news as he started to look 
around the inside of our home, taking it all in and surveying all that he 

TRANSFORM

could see. “How can I help you?” I bravely asked him. “Ma’am, your 
house was sold at auction today. I am now the owner. I’m ready to take 
possession and expect you to be completely moved out in two weeks 
or else I will take legal action.” He handed me some papers from his 
attorney mandating that we leave the house in good condition. 
There we were at rock bottom—feeling hurt, ashamed and hopeless. We 
had only a hundred dollars in our bank account, nowhere to live, and 
no reasonable way out of this mess. My husband, Joe, and I gave up 
control to a higher power to keep our family safe and provide us a new 
opportunity for growth. 
Within a week, we had completely moved out of the house, fixed up our 
little rental house and began a new chapter together as a family…One 
that would bring me closer to my husband and to our children…One that 
would reveal our true friends and the forces working behind the scenes 
to change everything for me. It was a new chapter that would lead to 
some unexpected, life-changing transformations – for our business 
and for me personally.
Just when the caterpillar thought the world  
was over, it became a butterfly.  
~ Proverb
Out of necessity, we turned to the resources we had – our persistent 
attitude, our business and our database. Throughout the years, we had 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring the names of our leads, 
prospects and clients. As we could no longer afford to spend $10,000 
per month on marketing and advertising, we were forced to get creative 
and resourceful!  We had current tax and financial clients who loved us 
and also had collected the names of so many who indicated interest in 
our services at one time. I thought, “Let’s see what happens if we turn 
our attention to them!” 
I began to tinker with Infusionsoft, the sales and marketing automation 
software program we had been using for a couple of years, and quickly 
realized we were only skimming the surface of the software’s true 
capabilities. I watched every tutorial and video in Infusionsoft’s online 
help center and participated in many of the educational webinars to 
learn how to apply all of its features in our small business. My husband 
affectionately referred to me as his “mad scientist” while I was conjuring 

51
FROM CATERPILLAR TO BUTTERFLY: MY LIFE-CHANGING TRANSFORMATION
up new follow-up sequences and automated email campaigns while also 
creating systems for our office procedures.
Joe and I immediately began to see things turn around in our business, 
and I had a brand-new hobby! It was an exciting new hobby that had 
me waking up in the middle of the night to head to my computer to 
implement as much as I could. I had fallen in love with marketing and 
this amazing software program.
Within 30 days, we had created effective new marketing campaigns and 
had automated processes for our tax practice. By utilizing only email 
marketing, we were able to fill more than 800 tax appointments. That 
tax season, we had nearly doubled our revenue and had slashed our 
marketing budget down to $500 per month.
Feeling a spark of hope and an enormous sense of pride, I decided to enter 
Infusionsoft’s “Ultimate Marketer” contest. I had seen advertisements 
for the contest and thought, “Why not? I’ve accomplished so much in 
such a short amount of time. I’d love to share my story with Infusionsoft!”
I began to practice positive thinking and visualization to create a mindset 
for winning. As I filled out responses in the contest application, I poured 
out my heart writing about the wonderful results we were experiencing 
by utilizing Infusionsoft and lifecycle marketing strategies. I explained 
how Infusionsoft had given me hope again and expressed my heartfelt 
gratitude for those life-changing turn of events. I felt incredibly blessed 
to be given the opportunity to continue to stay home with our children 
and be able to work and contribute to our small business in a way that 
wasn’t possible before. I submitted my application with various samples 
of our marketing and crossed my fingers!
When I received the call from Infusionsoft telling me I was one of three 
finalists who would be presenting at its annual conference, I couldn’t 
believe this was actually happening to me! I knew that preparing my 
presentation was going to be one of the most important things I would 
ever do and that I would be there for a greater purpose. If a stay-at-home 
mom could learn this software, implement these marketing strategies 
and see quick results, surely anyone could!
I felt compelled to inspire the thousands of small business owners at the 
conference to take action just as I had done. While I didn’t walk away 

TRANSFORM
52
as the “Ultimate Marketer 2011” that year, I won just the same. A new 
opportunity and business was born for me - one that would transform 
my life forever.
Other small business owners began to approach me, asking if I could 
help them like I helped my husband with his business. What first began 
as a hobby turned into part-time work, then full-time, and is now a full-
fledged business with a team in place! I have worked with hundreds of 
small business owners in a wide variety of industries to revamp their 
marketing and implement campaigns in Infusionsoft.
We delight in the beauty of a butterfly, but rarely admit  
the changes it had to go through to achieve that beauty. 
~ Maya Angelou
Over the years, Joe and I have enhanced our customer nurture campaign 
for our tax preparation and financial planning business. Now I teach 
my clients these same simple, yet effective strategies and present 
at workshops and conferences to help other small business owners 
implement them as well! I specialize in helping my clients keep top-
of-mind awareness with their leads, prospects, customers and referral 
partners so they are the first people their contacts think of when they are 
ready to buy or refer. Here are the tactics:
1. Monthly Nurture Emails: I encourage my clients to send 
monthly holiday greetings to their databases. A simple “Happy 
Thanksgiving” email with a favorite recipe or a “Happy 
Valentine’s Day” note with a special poem is a great way to stay 
in touch with their prospects and clients all year long. Making 
these communications entertaining and personal helps my clients’ 
contacts get to know them better and feel connected.
2. Printed Newsletters: Small business owners can build trust with 
their contacts by sending a monthly printed newsletter delivered 
right to the mailboxes of their prospects and/or clients. One of my 
coaches taught me that 60% of the newsletter content should be 
non-industry specific. Including highlights from a recent family 
vacation, thoughtful recipes, comics, games and puzzles helps 
prospects and clients know, like and trust the small business 
owner better.

53
FROM CATERPILLAR TO BUTTERFLY: MY LIFE-CHANGING TRANSFORMATION
3. Events: Hosting events for prospects and/or clients regularly can 
keep them educated about services, products or trends and lets 
them know how much they are appreciated. An event could be a 
promotion, a sale, a webinar or an in-person gathering. The sky’s 
the limit! Most of all, have fun and enjoy the time spent building 
these important relationships. 
4. Birthday Greetings: Saying “Happy Birthday” to customers 
with a special email, a card or even a personalized gift can make a 
huge and lasting impact. They will appreciate being remembered 
on their special day!
5. Special Touches: Letting customers know how much they’re 
appreciated is easy with special touches such as a welcome gift, 
a new customer kit or a postcard reminder. Joe and I send our 
new clients a delicious box of brownies to welcome them into 
our family of clients. Unexpected gifts and touches can go a long 
way towards solidifying relationships with new and existing 
customers. 
You, too, can implement these tactics into your marketing strategies. 
Once you do, you will begin to see results within a few months’ time. 
From the work I’ve done with my clients, I can tell you that it typically 
happens in four to six months. After hitting that mark, your business 
will grow noticeably.
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power 
we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better.  
~ JK Rowling
As for my personal transformation, I’ve learned some key techniques to 
keep me focused on my goals and to create what I want to experience 
next.
Here are some tips to help you clearly identify your desires and how to 
achieve them:
1. Focus: Set goals by getting super-focused about the experience 
you’d like to create next. I make long-term plans for the future, 
but I set goals that can be achieved within six to 12 months. That 
makes it easier to focus and more realistic to achieve them. Create 
notebooks, posters and vision boards with words and pictures 
describing your heart’s desires.

TRANSFORM
54
2. Gain support: You cannot create alone! Get support and advice 
to achieve your goals by joining a mastermind group for business 
advice and accountability, hiring coaches to keep you motivated 
and moving in the right direction, and finding peers to encourage 
and uplift you.
3. Repeat positive affirmations: Since thoughts become things, be 
careful about the thoughts you choose and the words you speak. 
I make a conscious effort to think positive thoughts by reading 
daily affirmations and listening to upbeat and inspiring songs.
4. Practice visualization: Each night as you are falling asleep, 
imagine yourself experiencing the life you want to live or 
achieving your goal. The most important thoughts you have each 
day are the ones you hold in your mind right before falling asleep. 
These are the thoughts that stay with you all through the night 
while you rest and sleep. They become deeply ingrained in your 
subconscious mind.
5. Stay grounded: In this day and age with so much technology, 
distractions and stress, it’s important to stay grounded. I 
recommend getting regular exercise, taking walks, washing 
dishes, dancing and cooking to stay grounded and connected with 
the earth.
6. Say the Ho’oponopono prayer: Live with forgiveness by saying 
this Hawaiian prayer to make things right with your current 
problems or troubled relationships. Hold that person or situation 
in your mind and say, “I love you. I’m sorry. Please forgive me. 
Thank you.” You will notice how problems get resolved easily or 
correct themselves with very little or no effort by you.
7. Express gratitude: Practice expressing your gratitude daily. Say 
“thank you” often through your words and actions. Whether you 
write a thoughtful email, send a handwritten card or give a shout-
out to someone on Facebook, remember to let others know how 
thankful you are for them!
A wonderful blessing that has emerged from my recent transformational 
experiences has been having the opportunity to inspire and motivate 
others to achieve their goals, to create their dream lifestyles, too!

PREPARING FOR A TRANSFORMED ECONOMY
CHAPTER 5
PREPARING FOR  
A TRANSFORMED  
ECONOMY
BY DENISE LONGSHAW
Being a long time follower of Brian Tracy, when I received the invitation 
to co-author a book with him I was ecstatic! Brian is my idol. I have been 
reading his books and listening to his audio recordings since I was a 
teenager. My immediate thought was to find the very first audio cassette, 
The Psychology of Success that I listened to when I was first introduced 
to Brian’s work back in 1989. I was excited when I found the cassette, 
but to my dismay I could not find a cassette tape player to listen to it. 
This dilemma made the topic of this book even clearer. Things change 
and the world has transformed. No longer are there cassette players and 
change is taking place in almost every aspect of our lives at a very rapid 
pace. Are you prepared for all the transformation that is taking place? 
Are you prepared to transform along with it?
My goal and purpose in my profession is to help pre-retirees and retirees 
through this transformation process by assisting them with developing 
the proper financial strategy that will enable them to enjoy a successful 
retirement. I began my financial services career in 2003 as a Financial 
Advisor with VALIC Financial Advisors, working primarily with State 
of Florida employees who are members of the Florida Retirement System 
(FRS). Always seeking to improve and expand in my profession, I went 
on to gain a broad knowledge of the industry by working with a variety 
of well-respected companies. 

TRANSFORM
58
I then combined my accumulated knowledge and established my own 
firm, the Longshaw Financial Group, to better serve my clients. I 
established my own financial practice to fulfill a growing need among 
Baby Boomers who seek a solid retirement strategy and a personalized 
approach to financial planning to help them achieve the financial 
security and independence they desire. The Baby Boomer generation is 
a unique group in that they have probably seen more financial change in 
a relatively short period of time than any other generation. 
As you know simply by your daily participation in the country’s 
economy, the financial world of the 2000’s is so much different than 
it was even in the late 1900’s. There have been huge changes in how 
retirement planning is done, and I suspect in the next ten to twenty years 
we will see even more unique changes to this very important area of 
people’s lives. Let’s consider some of the important national financial 
transformations that have taken place and how we must transform to 
face these changes. 
THE SOCIAL SECURITY DILEMMA 
Have you ever considered how the Social Security system has transformed 
since its inception? When the Social Security Act was passed in 1935 as 
part of President Roosevelt’s “New Deal” with America, it was based 
on certain mathematical and demographic information that needed to 
remain fairly constant in order for the plan to have longevity. When it 
was first implemented those that drafted the numbers based them on 
expected birth rates and life expectancies. 
Following is some of the information that led the proponents of this 
legislation to believe in this program. In 1935 there were 42 workers 
putting money into Social Security for every one that was drawing 
money out. That seemed to work well. Another astounding fact is that 
the government established retirement age at 65 when the average life 
expectancy at that time was only 62. If someone did live until they were 
65, it was highly unlikely they would live too many years beyond which 
also safeguarded the system. No one ever anticipated people living into 
their 80’s and 90’s when this law was enacted. 
How has Social Security transformed? According to the Social Security 
Administration website, today there are only 3 people contributing to 

59
PREPARING FOR A TRANSFORMED ECONOMY
Social Security for every 1 person drawing money out. It is projected 
that in 10 years that ratio will be 2 to 1. Additionally, people can now 
begin drawing Social Security at age 62 if they choose to do so. So the 
ratio of people contributing to people drawing money out is extensively 
narrower, retirees are withdrawing money from the system earlier, and 
people are living much longer. 
Add to this scenario that Social Security is actually costing the Federal 
Government over $700 billion a year which is equivalent to an astounding 
20% of their budget. Yes, Social Security has changed. In fact, did you 
know that the Social Security program was never designed to be a 
retirement program; it was originally simply an insurance program in 
case people happened to live beyond the age of 65. 
What does all this information mean for us today? Simply this; the 
Social Security program is in deep trouble and we need to take that 
into consideration when planning for retirement. People once depended 
on Social Security to sustain them. However, that can no longer be 
the strategy for retirement. It may be a factor in the strategy, but it is 
inevitably becoming less of a factor than in times past. 
THE GREATEST CHALLENGE IN THE HISTORY  
OF THE UNITED STATES
Within the last fifty years, the world has transformed from the advent of 
women’s liberation with mothers in the work force to globalization and 
technological changes at lightning speed. In fact, it is almost impossible 
to keep up with the transformation. However, there is one important 
change that occurred and it is still occurring. Unfortunately, many 
people do not seem to realize the severity of the situation and how it can 
affect them. The situation I am referring to is America’s Debt Crisis! 
America has transformed! Do you remember when American was the 
largest lender nation? Now America is the largest borrower. As of this 
writing, the U.S. national debt stands at $17,515,512,933,376.00 and 
will be substantially higher by the time this book is published. 

TRANSFORM
60
In 2012, I met Mr. David Woods, the former comptroller of the United 
States Accounting Office. For several years now Mr. Woods has been 
sounding the alarm about the U.S. Government debt and the trillions 
of dollars of unfunded debt. This is a man that has personally given 
oversight to the financial statements of the government. It is astounding 
to watch our debt rise continuously. If you haven’t seen the debt clock yet I 
encourage you to see the numbers for yourself at: www.usdebtclock.org.  
The debt clock is explicit evidence that we face an impending crisis in 
the near future. 
When someone is in debt they reduce their spending, increase their revenue 
or, as a last resort, file bankruptcy. It is plausible but unlikely that the U.S. 
Government will file bankruptcy. It is also unlikely that it will cut spending, 
because of the promised benefits and unavoidable strain that the aging 
population will put on the system as 77 million baby boomers file claims 
for social security and escalating health care costs as demand for Medicare 
benefits increase. In addition, the government must pay the interest, not the 
principal, on the debt to our creditors (countries such as China and Japan) 
and this could account for about one-third of our country’s spending. 
Therefore, the most likely answer is Higher Taxes! The Government will 
very likely raise taxes in the near future. This is perfect timing for Uncle 
Sam but very unfortunate for Baby Boomers who will be tapping their 
retirement accounts and must pay taxes on these distributions that have 
been growing tax deferred for up to the last thirty or more years.
I would like to impress upon you to really pay attention because it is 
pertinent that you begin to prepare now. It is important that you transform 

61
PREPARING FOR A TRANSFORMED ECONOMY
your thinking, transform your actions, and transform your life now as 
you brace for the impact of Higher Taxes! 
TAX DEFERRED INVESTING – GOOD OR NOT SO GOOD?
One thing that many people that are saving for retirement have in 
common is the majority of their retirement savings are in a tax-deferred 
vehicle, such as a 401k, 403b, 457 plan, IRA, SEP etc. The historical 
Wall Street strategy and industry norm has been to encourage investors 
to enroll in their employer’s tax deferred retirement plan because when 
you retire you will be in a lower tax bracket. 
As a retirement consultant, my primary clients are baby boomers and Florida 
public sector employees. My experience has been when I help clients to 
retire, most often, they are not in a lower tax bracket because they need to 
live on the same amount of income they had before they retired. Realizing 
this, I had to transform my practice and strategies to teach my clients how 
to transform along with these changes so they can have a secure retirement 
future and prepare for the tax impact that could be brewing.
It is very important for retirees to understand that, by law, they must 
begin at age 70½ taking a Minimum Required Distribution from their 
tax deferred retirement accounts even if they don’t need the money. The 
government requires you to take at least a minimum distribution based 
on a predetermined formula. This distribution has an impact on retirees 
in two ways. First, it reduces the amount of their investment. Secondly, 
the distribution is taxable at the current tax rate. 
If the owner of a tax deferred account passes away, the money in that 
account will go to the designated beneficiary. That beneficiary will then 
be responsible for paying the taxes on the distribution received based 
on their tax bracket. Keep in mind that if a beneficiary receives a lump 
sum payment from a tax deferred account, it will likely boost them into 
a higher tax bracket and they will have to pay taxes on the distribution 
based on that higher tax bracket. However, if it was in a tax-free account, 
it would be free and clear for the beneficiary. No income tax payment 
would be due. 
Since there is now a great likelihood that the tax rate for retirees may 
very possibly increase in the not too distant future, a larger portion of 
their spendable income will be lost. If you have to begin taking money 

TRANSFORM
62
from a taxable account, and your tax rate is higher, then your spending 
power will be diminished. That is why I encourage people to consider 
tax-free accounts. 
Tax consideration as it relates to retirement planning is crucial when 
developing a long-term financial strategy. There are specific strategies 
that pre-retirees and retirees need to consider when they are still in the 
accumulation phase of their life as well as when they begin drawing money 
from their retirement accounts. In the present day economy, I strongly 
believe people need to think about investing in tax-free vehicles as part of 
their retirement portfolio. A correct retirement strategy will enable them 
to maximize the use of their money for the longest period of time possible 
with the ultimate goal of never running out of money in their lifetime. 
THE PERFECT STORM
There is a perfect storm brewing. Baby Boomers are beginning to retire 
at the astounding rate of 10,000 per day. Not only are they beginning 
to draw money from the market to support them during their retirement 
years, but also they are now tapping into their Social Security benefit 
that they have contributed to for the past 45 years. This is placing a 
tremendous burden on the potential endurance of the Social Security 
system. Add to this the growing national debt, which will very likely 
result in an increase in taxation. Consider the risk of inflation, a 3% 
annual inflation rate equates to a 30% loss of purchasing power within 
10 years. Some economist are predicting future hyperflation. An increase 
in the rate of inflation can have a devastating effect on the income of 
a retiree. This is a game changer. Our nation has never experienced a 
phenomenon like this in its entire history. The convergence of these 
factors is creating an environment for the perfect storm that will have a 
tremendous impact on every person in the country. 
PREPARING FOR THE STORM
So, where do you turn for help in preparing for this inevitable storm 
that is brewing? Keep in mind that properly preparing for this storm 
will require extensive planning and forethought. What you do with your 
money has to be about planning, not just putting money into an account. 
When I first entered the financial services business I was trained to sell 
product. I was instructed to have a transaction orientation. However, 

63
PREPARING FOR A TRANSFORMED ECONOMY
as I matured in the business, I learned the difference between simply 
making an investment transaction and developing a retirement planning 
strategy. It was an eye-opening transformation for me. I learned how I 
could better serve my clients and direct them to make wise investment 
decisions based on what was going to be most beneficial to them in the 
long term. Find an advisor who will look at your entire financial picture 
and one who understands how to structure a portfolio with the proper 
mix of taxable, tax-deferred and tax-free accounts. 
Unfortunately there are many financial advisors that are simply 
transaction oriented and don’t take into consideration the potential tax 
ramifications for the client or their heirs. A transaction-based advisor 
will simply be looking for money to roll over into another account. It is 
imperative that you stay away from transaction-oriented advisors. 
You may ask, “How can I know if someone is a transaction based 
advisor?” I would suggest asking the advisor questions about tax-
deferred versus tax-free investments and why the investment he or she 
is recommending to you is in your best interest. A transaction-oriented 
advisor will likely not have straight answers to your questions. While 
this isn’t a foolproof methodology, it may help you discern what type 
of advisor you are talking to. It is also a good idea to find out who 
successful people you know are using as their tax advisor and why 
they are using them. Keep in mind that just because someone is using 
a financial advisor, in itself, doesn’t make the advisor good or bad. But 
the experience others have with an advisor may be some of the best 
information you can receive in your quest to find a qualified advisor. 
Ask questions about why they use their advisor and listen for reasons 
surrounding tax-deferred investing and tax-free investing. 
Finally, it is extremely important to work with an advisor who 
understands the strategies of retirement distribution planning. Many 
times the advisor who helped you to accumulate your assets may not be 
the advisor who is trained to help with distribution planning.
I believe the perfect storm is brewing. I don’t know exactly when the 
impact will take place or the extent of the damage that will be left in its 
path, but I do know the time to prepare is now. With the proper planning 
I’m very confident you will weather the storm and be a survivor.

About Denise
Denise Longshaw began her financial services career in 2003 
as a Financial Advisor with VALIC Financial Advisor. She worked 
primarily with State of Florida employees who are members of 
the Florida Retirement System (FRS). Always seeking a better 
approach, a better method, a better answer and the best results 
for the clients she serve, Denise gained industry wide experience working with 
companies such as InvestaCorp, Planmember Securities, ING Financial Partners and 
Bencor Retirement Group.
Denise observed throughout the years that many people make financial decisions with 
incomplete information or a limited knowledge of how money works. She believes 
a retirement plan cannot be a ten-minute conversation with a bank teller or fifteen 
minutes to enroll in an employer’s 401k or 403b plan. She believes it is an advisor’s 
responsibility to thoroughly understand the goals and dreams of the clients they 
serve and advisors should focus on doing investigational work first to get a genuine 
understanding of a client’s needs and to provide solutions rather than to sell products. 
Today, she is the President and Founder of LONGSHAW Financial Group, a financial 
services firm located in Broward County, Florida. LONGSHAW Financial Group was 
founded to fulfill a growing need among baby-boomers who seek a solid retirement 
strategy and a face-to-face, personalized planning approach to help them achieve 
financial security and independence. Longshaw Financial Group begins with a clean 
slate to design a custom fit retirement plan for each client. The firm works exclusively 
for clients and not for financial companies or brokerages.

SELF-EXPRESSION—HOW TO TRANSFORM EACH MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE
CHAPTER 6
SELF-EXPRESSION 
—HOW TO TRANSFORM EACH 
MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE
BY DAVID ZEMA
“Seen This Morning - Those passing by the old red brick school house at 
Third and Wood Street in the small town of Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania 
wondered why a group of young children were gathered by Mrs. 
Biagini’s kindergarten class window with curious looks on their faces.” 
~ An Imagined Newspaper Story.
It was a bright, sunny, spring day when, at the age of 5, I discovered 
my ability to make people laugh. A few weeks earlier at the hobby store 
next to where I lived, I saw a gag milk carton that made the sound 
of a cow mooing. Enthusiastically, I saved up my allowance to buy 
the maniacal moo machine and waited for the right moment to create 
complete commotion at school.
The little rectangular red milk carton looked just like the real thing 
complete with a cartoon drawing of an unusually cheerful cow. But 
unlike real milk containers, when turned upside down to pour the 
imaginary liquid this unique flask triggered a loud unrelenting mooing 
sound effect. 
All morning, I eagerly anticipated our lunch break. As soon as the 
teacher announced that it was time for lunch, I quietly and mischievously 
strolled to the refrigerator and grabbed the convincing yet counterfeit

carton of milk from my little blue lunch box. Right on cue, as they heard 
the sound of the longhorn, my teacher and classmates ran to the nearest 
window to see the moo cow they expected to be there.
If my classmates had turned around, they would have noticed me 
watching them - trying to contain my laughter as I pumped the little red 
carton again and again.
At first, my teacher and classmates experienced a moment of surprise 
followed by confusion then disappointment when they didn’t see the 
howling heifer. As soon as I revealed the source of the mooing to them, 
they began to laugh. Watching them realize they had been fooled, yet 
seeing that they could still enjoy the moment along with me, was the 
real payoff for yours truly.
Although, I discovered my knack for being funny that day, it wasn’t 
until much later that I realized how natural positive self-expression can 
help to turn around our most difficult experiences at every moment – 
should we allow it to. 
My expression of fun and joy seemed to come naturally and was shared 
on both sides of my family. My father, his father and my maternal 
grandfather told jokes and stories regularly. One of my aunts on my 
father’s side had the most infectious laugh that I had inherited as well. 
My maternal Grandmother and Grand Aunt were regarded by all as the 
most fun-loving people in our family. 
To balance my nature, my mother was more reserved, thoughtful, 
analytical, and could sometimes be reflective and introverted. 
Nevertheless, she was also very determined and persistent. Those were 
good qualities for me and my siblings to observe and emulate as well.
Little by little, I grew as a young performer, writer, producer, director 
and promoter. I was always learning how to express each emotion and 
communicate every nuance. 
In grade school, I asked my best friend, Lonnie, to work with me 
on writing, producing and performing a two person show. Then we 
promoted the idea to our teacher and she allowed us to do our two person 
mini extravaganza for the class just before the holidays. The play was 
well received and the audience chuckled throughout. The show was so 
successful that we were asked to do another play the next year. Later, 

67
SELF-EXPRESSION—HOW TO TRANSFORM EACH MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE
in junior high school we took over the entire gym for another holiday 
spectacle – which filled the space with laughter. 
However, my growth as impresario was abruptly interrupted by an 
upsetting and startling discovery. Besides, my childhood expression of 
my natural personality became subdued as well. 
Quite by accident, I found out that for many years my father was 
involved in an ongoing relationship with a girlfriend while still being 
married to my mother. At the time, I was still very young and wasn’t 
sure how to handle the situation. After all, I wasn’t sure if my mother 
knew about my father’s extra marital affair. I didn’t know how to speak 
to my mother or my father or his girlfriend about my feelings or their 
situation. 
My reactions at the time were anger, confusion, resentment and betrayal. 
I withdrew from reality and became very introverted. My internal world 
became shame-based and I only allowed myself to see things through my 
small window of embarrassment. In my thoughts and in my relationship 
with others, I was stuck replaying the same emotions again and again. 
No matter what happened to me during those days in my young life, I 
had the same reaction. Most of the time I was angry, easily frustrated, 
filled with uncertainty and dread. My nickname could have been “Johnny 
Sour Note.” 
Worse yet, because I was so wrapped up in my own negative emotional 
world, I became disconnected from people and events in the world 
beyond my mind. Everything that occurred went through my destructive 
internal filter, causing me to unconsciously intensify my own pain. 
Most notably, during those years I was completely unaware that I was 
suffering from past events and behaviors of other people over which I 
had no control. My recovery from my emotions about the discovery of 
my family’s secret, and progress in developing my personal expression 
of personality, would have been quicker had I realized these past events 
and the people involved were outside of my scope of influence. 
Yet, one of the only traits that protected my emotional well-being was 
that I still had the desire to see other people smile and laugh. Since 
I harbored such humiliation every waking moment, I had nothing to 
hold me back. So, I became the subject of the joke and didn’t feel any 

TRANSFORM
68
additional degradation at all. 
Actually, during those uncertain and trying times, making others smile 
or laugh at my expense became the best way to lift myself out of my 
depression. Creating laughter is still how I shift gears from personal pain 
to a better mood to this day. Somehow using my ability to make others 
laugh helped me to get the courage to continue on my quest to find the 
best way to express myself and explore my talents. Later I found out 
upon hearing many comedians interviewed, that they became addicted 
to their ability to make others laugh at an early age too. 
But at the time I felt incomplete as a person. My personality teeter-
tottered between unhappiness and ridiculousness – like it was a satirical 
version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and there was no end in sight. These 
impulsive mood swings made it difficult to make any real sustained 
progress toward becoming the fully functioning creative individual that 
I wanted to be.
My instincts drew my attention to creative areas of expression including 
writing, photography, film and video, public speaking and oral 
interpretation. I was also drawn to technical areas and teaching as well. 
Because I was stuck in a mental malaise, I felt lacking in these areas and 
couldn’t see through my own miasma far enough to develop my skills. 
About the time I began college, my older brother Gary who had recently 
moved to New York City had a terrible accident – which caused him to 
lose his right arm. I went to visit him that summer and was amazed at 
how quickly he had adjusted to the circumstances. He was a musician 
and composer. During this time he became even more involved in his 
most natural form of self-expression – creating music. I learned from 
him how important it is to continue exploring the constructive natural 
desires you have to express yourself—no matter what difficulties you 
may face.
I returned to my next semester at Cal U. of Pennsylvania as an inspired 
person determined to move away from my internal struggles and be an 
active participant in the present moment. 
My opportunity to explore the moment came one day in Dr. Blout’s 
public speaking class; we were discussing the upcoming Homecoming 
Queen election. As I read the rules, I noticed that it didn’t require the 

69
SELF-EXPRESSION—HOW TO TRANSFORM EACH MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE
applicant to be a female and joked that I would be eligible to run. Some 
of my classmates agreed and challenged me to run. So I did. 
Not long after that, I got a dose of self-awareness when I told one of 
my friend’s about my brother’s accident. He thought I was joking! I 
couldn’t believe that people perceived me as being nothing but a shallow 
prankster. 
That’s when I decided to lift myself out of my depression and to become 
a complete person. I wanted to people to know that I was much more 
than a grumpy guy who played practical jokes for no reason. However, 
the Homecoming Queen campaign was underway and would certainly 
continue the perception that I was only a superficial foolish person. 
Perhaps it was too late for me to become more than the class clown, 
because I already had a well-known local photographer who shot 
pictures of the other candidates do my headshot as well. I printed posters 
that wisecracked “Forget the Face, Remember the Name.” They were 
already plastered all over campus. Who would believe that I didn’t just 
do this as some silly stunt?
How would I ever convince people that I was more than just another 
smiling face? Would they accept me for what I truly stand for? Or would 
they reject me? 
At that moment, I realized that one of the best ways to get people’s 
attention is through humor and controversy. With that thought in mind, 
I calmed down and wrote out ideas to turn what started out on a whim 
into something constructive for all involved. 
After a heated campaign, I won. Many people expected me to stop there. 
Certainly, the college wanted me to admit that it was all a joke and to 
quit. No way! Now I had the opportunity to express my message. So, I 
felt that I couldn’t quit and have self-respect, let alone gain the respect 
of others. 
Then I expressed to everyone that I believed that the role of Homecoming 
Queen could be used to promote the college. Many agreed when I 
pointed out the flimsy requirements to run for queen. They listened 
when I suggested that the Homecoming Queen and the ceremony could 
be used to promote the college academically, and not just as another 
beauty pageant. 

TRANSFORM
70
I achieved my goal to be perceived as a thoughtful person. More 
importantly, people were thinking and speaking about the roles of men 
and women in our generation. 
To continue to promote my ideas about role models, the next year I asked 
Kitty Dasta, a 34 year old mother of four children who I met during 
my campaign, to run for homecoming queen. Of course, I managed 
her campaign and she won the title by a landslide. At the ceremony, I 
proudly turned over the crown to Kitty who could continue carrying the 
torch as an enlightened example of an ideal persona for our generation. 
Of course, we got even more favorable media attention that year for the 
college.
I felt so alive and enjoyed working on those two homecoming events. 
I learned to deal with my emotions and adversity as well. During this 
time I also met a young woman named Judy who became my lifelong 
friend and companion. By following through with my ambitions and 
beginning a path of self-discovery and learning, I found the encouraging 
nature in my experiences and met many wonderful friends.
In many ways I realized that I was lucky to have a supportive family, 
even if it was dysfunctional. My teachers, friends and classmates also 
enjoyed and encouraged me to explore and express my talents. Far too 
often, I witness parents, teachers and other adults consistently limiting 
self-expression in children, younger people and even adults. Of course, 
guidelines must be spelled out for appropriate expression in social 
situations. But I believe that we must help ourselves and our community 
to learn how we can use self-expression to become the best we can be. 
For example, I recently saw a commercial for an insurance company 
that follows a young man throughout his day. First we see water pouring 
on his head as he walks down the street. Afterward, he moves a nearby 
flower pot so that it can receive the downpour and continues on his way. 
Next he helps an older street vendor lift her cart onto the sidewalk. A dog 
begs for a scrap of food as he eats lunch at a sidewalk cafe. The young 
man gives him a chicken wing instead, as the cook who is watching 
shakes his head as if to suggest he doesn’t understand. A mother and her 
young daughter sit peacefully on the sidewalk with a sign saying “funds 
needed for education.” He reaches into his wallet to find only two bills. 
He gives them both to the little girl as a nearby vendor shakes his head 

71
SELF-EXPRESSION—HOW TO TRANSFORM EACH MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE
in dismay. When the young man reaches his home, he quietly places a 
bunch of bananas on his elderly neighbor’s door. She slowly opens the 
door and discovers the fruit but he is gone. We hear the announcer say, 
“What does he get in return for doing this every day?”
As time goes on, the plant flowers, the dog adopts him, the girl goes to 
school because of his help, the old neighbor lady discovers him and gives 
him a hug, and the street vendor gives extra helpings while he helps her. 
The narrator tells us that he gets nothing from this and no one will know 
about it. However, the voice goes on to say that the young man feels 
many emotions, witnesses happiness, reaches a deeper understanding, 
feels the love, and most importantly, receives what money can’t buy – a 
world more beautiful. Then the voiceover asks, “What do you desire 
most?
As a coach, I have seen many people stuck expressing the same emotions 
or stopping their own progress. Helping them to discover their blocks 
and create ways to overcome them and to see their own strengths, has 
been my most rewarding experience in life. 
At the time of this writing, it has been about 40 years since these events 
occurred, but I remember them clearly because they shaped my future. 
Now my brother and I have discovered that we are eligible to be Italian 
citizens. Accordingly, our next transformation will be as dual citizens 
with new challenges of traveling, learning a new language and culture. 
With all of the lessons that I have learned available to help me make 
new discoveries, I am filled with wonder, awe and a sense that it will 
be an even greater exploration period in my life. I look forward to how 
I will transform myself through expressing my natural qualities during 
the next years of my life.

HOW A SMALL-TOWN DENTIST IN RURAL AMERICA GENERATED 549 NEW PATIENTS 
CHAPTER 7
HOW A SMALL-TOWN  
DENTIST IN RURAL  
AMERICA GENERATED  
549 NEW PATIENTS FROM  
A THREE-HOUR EVENT  
WITHOUT ANY MARKETING!
BY DAROLD D. OPP, DDS
Does generating 549 new patients from a patient appreciation event 
sound too good to be true? Jerry Jones, one of the best marketers in 
dentistry, touted this success story as “the non-marketing marketing 
wonder of dentistry!” during his 2013 Dental Office: IMPOSSIBLE 
marketing extravaganza held in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Before we delve into this marketing wonder, let me introduce myself. 
My name is Dr. Darold Opp, and I practice family dentistry in Aberdeen, 
South Dakota. I live in rural America. I am an average dental clinician. I 
have a great team, and we have a unique business model. My collections 
in 2011, 2012, and 2013, during one of the most challenging economies 
in history, averaged over $3.3 million—$1.3 million in hygiene and $2 
million in restorative dentistry. Here is where it gets really interesting. 
I do not do any of the following procedures: oral surgery including 
implants, orthodontia, sedation, sleep apnea, TMJ, dentures, full mouth 
crown and bridge, and upper molar endodontics. A number of dentists at

76
the 2013 Jerry Jones event asked me, “What is your secret?”
My simple and honest answer? A patient appreciation event! But not 
just any event, mind you. Our SmilePalooza celebration is so unique 
that my local newspaper called it “South Dakota’s Version of Disney 
World.”
Our event has grown each year, and so have our results. In 2010 we 
generated 147 new patients and $165,588 in direct revenue. In 2011, 
172 new patients and $181,425 in revenue. In 2012, 230 new patients 
and $206,116 in revenue. In 2013, we created a customized pre-event 
and post-event marketing campaign for the first time, and our numbers 
skyrocketed: 232 new patients and $397,594 in annual revenue with 
a lifetime value of $1,160,000. All accomplished with our three-hour 
SmilePalooza event.
Here is the crazy part: We began SmilePalooza in 2008 with no intention 
of it being a new patient magnet. My hope and desire was to create a 
simple appreciation day for my own patients. But when you live in a 
small community and have an event in a public venue, it is extremely 
hard not to open the day to everyone. Hesitantly, that is what we did, 
and our first-year attendance was eye-popping. We were expecting 300 
people, and more than 3,000 attended. We had ordered 900 hot dogs, 
and we ran out in the first hour. We were frantic, to say the least!
Hot dog shortages aside, our inaugural event was a resounding success. 
We registered 850 children that first year and stopped counting because 
we ran out of registration stickers. Of those 850 kids, 87 percent were 
not our patients, so we realized that opening our event to the public 
was a great idea after all. SmilePalooza was truly a serendipitous new 
patient magnet. We did not create any post-event marketing with offers 
to entice attendees to come to our office until 2013. We know at least 
549 new patients came unsolicited during 2010-2012. We failed to track 
adequately in 2008 and 2009, so our new patient numbers actually far 
exceeded the 549 we counted.
Here is where it gets really interesting. After our 2008 event, we saw a 
surge of families come into our office stating that SmilePalooza was their 
main referral source. We couldn’t believe this was happening simply 
because of a three-hour event, so we decided to host another event the 
following year, thinking we would “debunk” what had happened in 

77
HOW A SMALL-TOWN DENTIST IN RURAL AMERICA GENERATED 549 NEW PATIENTS 
2008. We were in for another surprise. More than 4,000 people attended 
in 2009, and the kid count was even higher than in 2008.
I must admit that the idea of an appreciation event did not originate with 
me. One of my marketing mentors is Dan Kennedy. Dan is considered to 
be the world’s greatest marketer and millionaire maker. He loves event 
marketing and believes it is one of the top means of creating practice 
buzz and reciprocation. You may wonder how reciprocation relates to 
marketing. Robert B. Cialdini, Ph.D., the foremost expert on social 
psychology in the world, has written a classic book entitled “Influence: 
The Psychology of Persuasion.” In this book he writes about six 
principles of influence that permeate every society. The first principle 
is reciprocation: If you do a kindness for another, they will feel an 
obligation to return the favor. The incredible success of SmilePalooza 
in securing new patients was simply the principle of influence at work. 
And work it did!
So, what makes SmilePalooza such a unique event? First of all, no 
one else is doing one similar. When we began thinking about having 
an appreciation event for our patients, I did exhaustive research both 
offline and online about how to market an event like this, and I came up 
empty. I could not find anything like it outside or inside dentistry. That 
was frustrating. How in the world would I even begin to try planning 
such an endeavor? But as they say in business, you are either a pioneer 
who paves the way or you are a settler who reaps the efforts of others. 
We weren’t given a choice. We had to be pioneers. Our long history of 
working with children in the office and creating innovative ideas that 
give us staying power in the community was in our favor. We already 
knew what kids and their families enjoy.
And so we created SmilePalooza to be a one-of-a-kind, fun-filled family 
extravaganza. Imagine with me an afternoon in the park where 4,000 
people gather to see Super Heroes and Disney Princesses come to life, 
the Tooth Fairy and Tooth Man welcoming old and new friends, multiple 
inflatable bounce houses, 20-foot-tall walking puppets roaming the park, 
and the world’s largest bubble tower filling the sky. Plus we have fire 
trucks, clowns, circus animals, live music, dance contests, horse races, 
celebrities on stage, crazy activities for all ages, shirt cannons, snacks 
and drinks, and tons of prizes. And the best part—all the laughter, all the 
screams of joy, all the pictures, and all the family memories are FREE! 

TRANSFORM
78
Google “SmilePalooza 2013” and see for yourself why it has become 
the #1 free kids’ event in dentistry.
One of the rewards of SmilePalooza has already been discussed: 
new patients. And that is very significant! It is no secret that in 2008 
the economy went south in a big way. Roger P. Levin, DDS, a well-
recognized dental consultant, wrote in the May/June 2013 Dental 
Business Review that a shocking 75 percent of practices had declined in 
the preceding four years, not only in income but in new patient numbers 
as well. In the same newsletter, a roundtable of practice analysts was 
asked to name the #1 area of concern in the dental practice. They all 
echoed the same thing: having trouble filling hygiene schedules. My 
current dental consultant, Mike Abernathy, DDS, wrote in his new book, 
“The Super General Dental Practice,” that the economic downturn of 
2008 has drastically changed the business of dentistry and it may never 
be the same again. Dr. Abernathy goes on to say that we need to be very 
creative and innovative about the type of dental services we offer, and 
we also must do everything in our power to keep satisfied patients in our 
practice and to find new ways to create a competitive advantage.
Speaking of competitive advantage, if I asked you what sets you apart 
from the dental practice next door or down the street, what would 
your answer be? In my small rural community of 26,000, there are 18 
dentists. For 24 years of my dental career, I was frustrated by trying 
to separate myself from the crowd. In the consumer’s mind, which is 
the only perception that really matters, I was no different from the guy 
next door. Look at any yellow pages ad or, better yet, any website, and 
you will be hard-pressed to decide what differentiates Doctor “A” from 
Doctor “B”.
SmilePalooza was truly serendipitous, not only because it has generated 
hundreds of new patients over the past six years, but also because it has 
given us a unique competitive advantage that has placed my office into 
the top “mental real estate” of the moms in my community. Why is that 
so important? Moms schedule 92 percent of all dental appointments. 
In addition, Sally Hogshead in her book, Fascinate: Your 7 Triggers to 
Persuasion and Captivation writes about a study in which more than 
1,000 people were asked “What is your #1 fascination in life?” Ninety-
six percent responded with “my children.” For any family dentist 
reading those words, this should be an “aha!” moment. The incredible 

79
HOW A SMALL-TOWN DENTIST IN RURAL AMERICA GENERATED 549 NEW PATIENTS 
success of SmilePalooza was in part orchestrated by the planning that 
my team leader and I did, but as Dr. Cialdini revealed in his research 
on the principles of influence, we were fortunate to target the two most 
critical pieces of our event’s success, moms and their children.
While increasing patient numbers and prospective income was the 
first reward from our event, there were so many more than we ever 
anticipated. For example, what business, including dentistry, would 
turn away free publicity? For six years running, our local newspaper 
has covered SmilePalooza as a news story, complete with eye-catching 
photographs and the reporter’s commentary. Having our story become 
one of the top views of the day and remain in the top 10 researched for 
several days after the event was invaluable. The headline South Dakota’s 
Version of Disney World would have cost thousands of dollars to buy as 
ad space, so the free price tag made it even more priceless!
Increased name recognition in the community helps place you and 
your practice into an additional position of influence, something that 
Dr. Cialdini calls social proof/authority. In 2010 our practice won the 
prestigious ABBY award, which is the highest honor for community 
involvement in our city. No other dentist has won the award in its 20-year 
history, and we were blessed to overcome all odds, coming in ahead of 
3M, a company of 750 employees, and Avera Health, Aberdeen’s largest 
employer, with a team of more than 1,300. Not a bad accomplishment 
for an office of 10! In 2012 we were awarded The Hometown Hero 
award for our commitment to SmilePalooza and the numerous other 
projects we undertake to better our community. I say these things not 
to impress you but to impress upon you that anyone can accomplish 
similar things, if not more, simply by creating a niche that is unique.
In 2013, I came to the conclusion that if we wanted to take our 
SmilePalooza event to the next level, then we needed to leverage 
ourselves through the power of networking. Our positive reputation 
in the community had grown, and it had caught the attention of other 
businesses, allowing us to garner sponsorships for our event. Through 
a simple, well-crafted appeal letter, we raised over $19,000 in cash 
donations and in-kind gifts, literally eliminating all of our hard costs 
for SmilePalooza. We were able to generate $397,594 in new patient 
revenue with minimal or no financial costs of our own. Who wouldn’t 
like that return on investment? And there’s more! Sponsorships also 

TRANSFORM
80
allowed us to expand our influence into our sponsors’ networks when 
they personally invited their clients to the event, leveraging even more 
“dental ambassadors” for SmilePalooza for years to come.
Now we are adding another feature to SmilePalooza, and it’s one that 
has us extremely excited. Make-A-Wish®, the charitable foundation that 
grants wishes to children who are sick, is becoming actively involved 
in pre-promotion as well as participating in the event itself. Considering 
our focus on making a difference for moms and their children, partnering 
with this charity makes all the sense in the world. Plus, here is another 
piece of information that I find interesting: 68 percent of moms prefer to 
go to a dentist who is committed to a cause. Interesting data! Make-A-
Wish includes references to our partnership on all its social media sites 
and is providing ongoing promotions up to the day of the event. Can you 
ever have enough people singing your praises? Not in today’s economy!
Another new feature relates to our registration process on the day of 
the event. We obviously give people the opportunity to preregister on a 
SmilePalooza website prior to the event, but the vast majority of families 
sign in on site. New technology has allowed us to instantly merge 
attendees’ names into a database that immediately starts our marketing 
program the second they hit the submit button. Strike while the iron is 
hot! In addition, the attendees have the opportunity to sign up for a free 
computer-based loyalty program that has weekly interactive contests, 
free games, and other goodies that allow us another opportunity to stay 
engaged with potential new patients throughout the course of the 12 
months leading up to the next year’s event.
We have created an extensive marketing program that keeps SmilePalooza 
actively working throughout the year. Through scripted emails, recorded

are able to reach a “warm” lead (someone who has attended our event) 
with our marketing efforts. One cannot overestimate the importance of 
repeated contacts to the same leads. A commonly-accepted marketing 
principle is that it takes as many as seven positive touches to get a 
prospect to become a buyer. If the event is our first impression with an

PERSEVERANCE PAYS OFF
CHAPTER 8
PERSEVERANCE PAYS OFF
BY DAVID ALTENBERN
My story is one of perseverance pays off, starting with a great belief in 
myself, and the following lessons of life and business. Hopefully, it will 
inspire at least one person to become all that they can be.
To be more specific, I went from being on top of the world and living 
life large in my dream house on a lake with a pool and the owner of a 
thriving law firm, to a life of internal strife as a result of the premature 
2006 death of my beautiful daughter, then going on to a life of “escape” 
in Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands, followed by making a “hard comeback” 
to where we are today – positively touching more lives than ever in 
our thriving Houston, Texas law firm that handles major personal injury 
matters, along with Family law and Business cases. In short, my life 
story is a true testament to that old adage that God works in mysterious 
ways. 
Then again, it is my firm belief that we are not here to understand 
everything that comes our way. Rather, we are here to always make the 
best choices possible from the circumstances that we face. 
The eternal truth is that we never really know when...or how...God 
or “Angels on Earth” will touch us, teach us, and turn us in to new 
directions for our happiness and success. We should live our lives by the 
lesson of the Serenity Prayer – 
“God, grant me the Serenity to Accept  
the things I cannot change; 

TRANSFORM
84
The Courage to Change the things I can;  
and the Wisdom to know the Difference.”
There is also that special poem “Don’t Quit”: 
“Don’t quit when the tide is lowest,  
for it’s just about to turn;
Don’t quit over doubts and questions,  
for there’s something you may learn; 
Don’t quit when the night is darkest,  
for it’s...I”
In summary, I went from very difficult feelings to now networking with 
hundreds of professionals, owners, and key managers of businesses 
weekly, with more time now than ever for daily trips to Lifetime Fitness, 
and enjoying nightly television with my wife, all with more energy and 
while helping serve more clients than ever. 
As the coffee cups to our new clients profess, “We work hard for Justice 
our Clients Deserve”…“Earning Client Trust…and Opponent Respect…
One Case at a Time.” We also like to think that our connections and 
experience make a difference. My experienced legal assistants, especially 
the very dedicated Laura, have kept us going strong. Hiring, training, 
supervision, effective delegation, and direction of your “professional 
team” simply is important. We like to think of ourselves as the “A-Team” 
and we take a very personal approach to our team/family.
Now please don’t misunderstand. It is not my message that all good 
comes about by pure luck or fate or destiny. Rather, it is that by following 
certain fundamental keys to success, you can best balance your physical, 
emotional/spiritual, and business interests.
You may wonder if there is one key or secret to success? My answer is 
no. The truth is that there are several fundamental principles that can 
best position ourselves for success.
First, proper foundations are important. For most of us, that involves a 
great belief in ourselves, strong family support, an excellent education, 
and positive role models/mentors along the way. Sports played a big part 
of growing up. As one coach told our team…“the true value of sports 

85
PERSEVERANCE PAYS OFF
lies in the lessons taught about life, leadership, teamwork, learning to 
win, learning to lose with the right perspectives, and most importantly, 
learning to think large and outside of yourself.” Wanting to be a lawyer, 
I also liked reading Hardy Boys mysteries and law-related books and 
taking psychology and communication courses in school. I attended 
great colleges at Michigan State University (Criminal Justice Major), 
and The University of Texas School of Law. Working in your field early 
in life also helps, like clerking and being an assistant investigator for 
a great law firm. A legendary trial lawyer once told me, “A lawyer’s 
credibility is what it’s all about for success in trials, as well as following 
the old adage about preparation, preparation, and more preparation.” 
These words made lasting impressions upon me. 
Second, the right attitude and approach to communication are essential 
to success. To begin with, people tend to best learn one of three ways 
– First, some learn best by visual ways; Second, others learn best in an 
audible fashion; Third, some learn most in an emotional/kinetic way. 
So if we communicate that our audience can “see, hear, and feel” our 
message, we will greatly improve our relationships. My father always 
told me that, no matter my specific education focus, learning as much 
as possible about communication and psychology serve me well in life. 
Studies also show that the most successful people network and exercise 
more than others, and I definitely endorse those findings. 
The principles of primacy and recency should help structure our 
communications. In addition, actions to follow our promises always 
speak louder than words alone. Finally, recent neuropsychology 
research concludes that people tend to make decisions on the basis of 
subliminal concerns regarding the safety and welfare of themselves and 
their immediate family. Therefore, by making our appeals to others with 
this in mind (in addition to emotional and rational appeals) can best 
achieve our goals.
Third, being positive, balanced, and always looking for self- 
improvement is what all of us should strive to do. Taking an approach 
that we are “always learning” is an important attitude for success. We 
should always read, watch, and listen to as much self-improvement 
wisdom and meaningful news that we can stand. Music alone can be 
a valuable and great teacher—just listen to the words of Rascal Flatts’ 
“My Wish” or Lee Ann Womack’s “I Hope you Dance.” 

TRANSFORM
86
Fourth, learning from role models is important. My father’s intense 
work ethic and discipline that led him to early retirement and financial 
independence, as well as my mom’s great compassion, and my wife 
Linda being my greatest cheerleader has always kept me going strong. 
One special Valentine’s gift of years ago – a crumpled coffee cup – had 
this memorable “I Love You, Despite Your Imperfections.” Learning 
from great trial attorneys has also helped me. Finally, I am also a disciple 
of the BNI way of “Givers gain.” 
We should regularly make “to do lists” and then prioritize the items. We 
also need to focus our efforts as follows:
1. Identify the real prospects of your business;
2. Build rapport;
3. Make your appeal (on how you can help and/or be a resource);
4. Overcome obstacles (timing, price, service, and other details);
5. Close the deal. 
Fifth, the determination, vision, and perseverance to succeed, along 
with regular a) self-assessment and b) self-redirection are cornerstones 
to success. As they say, “it’s not where you start, but rather, where you 
finish in life.” It is good to remember we need to pass through a few 
storms in life to get to the rainbows. Finally, it is the proper mastery 
of the distinct stages of successful sales and goal setting as espoused 
and taught by Brian Tracy that distinguishes the most successful people 
from others. 
We need to become the person that many others come to know, like, 
and trust before we can be truly successful. Another important lesson is 
the “24 Hour Rule”: we should not make significant decisions, absent 
necessity, before 24 hours from when we find ourselves faced with the 
critical choice. We simply tend to make better decisions when we follow 
this rule.
Acting with great professionalism, energy, passion, focus, communication, 
and actions of a leader will be noticed by others. One of the most important 
lessons of “servant leadership” is also “seeking to understand before you 
seek to be understood” or listening first before you try to persuade.

87
PERSEVERANCE PAYS OFF
As a sports advertisement once stated, in order to become a champion, 
you need “Hard Work, Practice, Intensity, and Passion,” and most 
important, the ability to “Repeat.” Learning to be “out of the box” and 
with risks calculated/reward analysis will also help distinguish you 
along the way. Helping someone or imprinting memorable words of 
wisdom onto others has priceless rewards. “Spreading goodwill” to all 
that you touch, irrespective of the income, is always a good thing. The 
value of the proper timing and tone to effective communication is often 
underestimated in my experience.
As for using psychology to our success, the people with whom we 
deal all want a few basic things. First, they want to feel good about the 
person with whom they deal and about the money they spend. Second, 
they want to feel like they obtain a real deal on their decisions - in terms 
of value, convenience, and/or price. “Another day in Paradise” attitude 
breeds success. Finally, the word “help” is probably the most important 
single word in generating success - knowing when and whom to ask for 
help, as well as being known as the “resource person” who gives help 
is invaluable.
To best network, we need to learn to ask questions and be an active 
listener. A most important network question is “Do you know someone 
who does _____?” In this way, we open the brain of our audience to 
their entire “sphere of influence” (including themselves) as opposed to 
the less effective, and more narrow question “Do you do _____?” The 
art of asking interesting and open ended questions, along with the art of 
storytelling (to help make memorable impressions), are a couple keys 
to our growth. 
In closing, my perspective is that everyone is fully capable of achieving 
their full potential of happiness and success by following the guiding 
principles as outlined above. Simply put “perseverance pays off” – so 
long as we maintain a firm belief in our self-worth and talents and we 
continually work at self-improvement, always engaging in hard work, 
practicing focal analysis with regularity, and dedicating ourselves to 
overcome the storms that will undoubtedly come our way. With these 
approaches, we can all truly achieve our highest potential and our 
version of the American Dream. 
We all have valuable viewpoints to share with others. Hopefully, you 
have enjoyed mine. My wish is that you too live the life that you have

always wanted, and that in some small way, this story contributes to 
making a positive difference.

MIND YOUR Ps & Qs TO POLISH YOUR EXECUTIVE SKILLS AND SHINE IN BUSINESS
CHAPTER 9
MIND YOUR Ps & Qs  
TO POLISH YOUR  
EXECUTIVE SKILLS AND 
SHINE IN BUSINESS
BY BARBARA HINES
My early education was at the feet of a disciplined and strict Army 
officer father and his quintessential Army wife who together embodied 
‘duty, honor and country’. They raised their tribe of children to behave 
in public, dress well, speak courteously (Yes, Sir) and be respectful of 
position. This firm boundary of good manners and sturdy work ethic 
surrounded a fun, creative and carefree childhood filled with my stay-
at-home mother’s artistic activities and my dad’s entertaining, loving 
and protective nature. Minding your Ps and Qs for me meant paying 
attention to the details while having fun.
As a female Army Brat in the 1960s, I was also expected to get an 
excellent education (the real purpose of which was to nab a suitable man 
rather than have a career), to be brave and adapt to change with many 
household moves, to use good manners to build successful relationships 
and to participate in and support the community.
As life happens, I was propelled to address all of the above as a teenager 
when several accidents within a few years claimed the lives of my brother, 
sister, cousin and dear father, leaving us devastated and at a very loose 
end, until an old family friend with a big military future married my 

TRANSFORM
92
mother and moved us to Washington, DC. My way of coping with a new 
life and family was to stay very busy. Within months, I was fortunate 
enough to be selected to serve as one of the first female Pages in the U.S. 
Senate, breaking a nearly century and-a-half tradition.
In one fell swoop, my life changed drastically; I finally had something 
exciting to care about, so willingly adapted to change, embraced 
education albeit on a huge new learning curve supported by my new 
father’s diplomatic job, started a promising career as a female icon 
(who knew?), really enjoyed the ‘start-up’ aspect of this new enterprise, 
discovered I was ambitious and good at noticing details, built new 
relationship skills using polite manners, and helped others while 
becoming part of a lifelong community that includes the likes of Bill 
Gates. This story pretty much sums up my career supported by a formal 
university education, on-the-job training in a household that regularly 
held diplomatic events and a variety of high stakes work experiences.
By minding your Ps and Qs (paying attention to details) and continuously 
challenging, learning and adapting, especially to new technologies 
and fluctuating staff environments, you too will be able to polish your 
executive relationship building, communication and negotiating skills 
to shine in business by acting to connect, interacting to communicate 
and interconnecting to collaborate:
1. PROFESSIONALISM & QUESTIONS TO CONNECT 
‘Acting’ with professionalism firstly means using the skill, good 
judgment, and polite behavior that is expected from a person who is 
trained to do a job well. This is your individual action to polish your 
skills to create a winning, balanced and successful business future with 
persistent investigative actions to connect:
•	 Research potential clients and reasons to work together - Do your 
homework and be resourceful. As Thomas Edison said, ‘Genius 
(i.e., success in business) is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration,’ 
so put in the effort to find opportunities and ways to help the people 
with whom you wish to connect.
•	 Understand goals - Based on your research, ask yourself what 
dynamic changes will affect a person or business for the better and 
determine how you can help them achieve it. Find the need, and fill 
it with factual and useful information.

93
MIND YOUR Ps & Qs TO POLISH YOUR EXECUTIVE SKILLS AND SHINE IN BUSINESS
•	 Develop a networking strategy to connect - People buy people so 
it helps to meet someone through trusted mutual contacts whether 
through a colleague, group or network event. So buy that ticket or 
ask to be introduced, and position yourself to successfully connect.
•	 Establish relationship trust with empathy, humor and common 
experience - It takes only 7 seconds to know if you will do business 
with someone, so take a deep breath and pay attention when saying 
hello with a firm handshake and smile. Say their name and use simple 
manners - ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. Compliments help break the 
ice but only if genuine. Take notice to identify personal or business 
conversational topics such as hobbies or events in which they 
invest, use professional verbiage and open body language, speak in 
the positive and act with kindness, dress appropriately, remember 
the nose knows, maintain an arm’s distance of space, have a funny 
and safe (non-political / non-religious / non-sexual) joke ready to 
tell, relate common human experiences, give knowledge and find 
an opportunity to mention or demonstrate that you are committed 
to being accountable.
•	 Ask questions, listen and paraphrase for clarity - We have two ears 
and one mouth for a reason. Ask a question and give the gift of 
your full attention and eye contact to let people speak and fully 
answer the question without interruption, which is usually a good 
provider of more information than originally requested. Listening 
and paraphrasing questions for clarification help you narrow down 
the goals and real concerns to address.
•	 Demonstrate how your proactive leadership and ideas create 
opportunities to solve business problems - Conversation is a 
dynamic opportunity to explore challenges and solutions to 
problems. In one prepared sentence, relate an example of how you 
applied your skill successfully to accomplish a goal that a business 
was concerned about achieving, and perhaps what innovation you 
injected to design a new, more efficient way around a problem that 
led to success for the person, business or member community.
•	 Relate your credentials - Find an opportunity to mention a place 
where you worked, person you helped, school you attended or a 
relevant course you took to share your credentials to do the job that 
may be on offer.

TRANSFORM
94
•	 Gain commitment to work with you - As every salesman knows, 
you must always ask for the order because you have nothing to lose 
but if you get a negative reply, let them off the hook graciously, with 
humor even, offer your business card and promise to help anytime. 
You never know what the future holds or when opportunity will 
knock. The best you can do is lay out the red carpet and open 
the door with a smile. Remember, rejection only means you’ve 
eliminated something that doesn’t work to get closer to a more 
defined opportunity.
2. PROFILE & QUALITY TO COMMUNICATE 
Once you’ve made a good contact, use your connecting skills to 
‘interact’ with well-written and efficient communications for a win-win 
relationship. There has never been an easier time than in today’s social 
media frenzy to craft your unique personal message and publicize it 
over many channels, but it is important to be clever about managing 
time, expectations and the written word. Communicating your message, 
profile, measure of excellence and suitability for purpose will help drive 
business to your door, so minding these Ps & Qs will help:
•	 Think before you speak - Refrain from saying anything out loud 
or in writing that you would not wish to see on the front page of a 
newspaper or go viral - On the first day of my first job as a Page, 
my female colleague and I were barred from the Cloakroom and 
therefore from doing our jobs by Senators who were unaccustomed 
to having girls around to see them tuck in their shirts, smoke cigars, 
curse and tell jokes. The Equal Rights Amendment had recently 
passed in the House of Representatives but not yet in the Senate. 
Spurred by Washington Post reporters who chased us to contest 
this infraction, my colleague asked me to join her in complaining 
in public via an interview, which I refused as I wanted to have a 
second day on the job. That weekend, her picture and story were on 
the front page of the Style section and we once again had the use of 
the Cloakroom, but it crippled her senior relationships. I admired 
her guts but, agree or not, preferred to use diplomatic backchannel 
communications to achieve the goal.
•	 Nurture Relationships - Good business karma says ‘act to help’ 
with thoughtful intent and there are many channels to court and 
communicate with new contacts, the most popular being LinkedIn. 

95
MIND YOUR Ps & Qs TO POLISH YOUR EXECUTIVE SKILLS AND SHINE IN BUSINESS
Ask for referrals to make contacts and nurture them. If you see an 
article or hear of a morsel of interesting and useful information, 
send a quick note to help a potential client stay in the loop, look 
good at work, say happy birthday or to congratulate them on a job 
well done. If your gesture is appreciated or reciprocated, you’ve set 
the scene for success. This investment applies to internal contacts 
as well, especially your boss, as sooner or later you will likely need 
their help.
•	 Use Spellcheck and manage expectations - When communicating 
in writing, nothing screams ‘unprofessional’ or ‘dinosaur’ more 
than sloppy inattention to spelling and grammar. If you wouldn’t 
say it, avoid writing it, and avoid writing it if you would only say it 
privately. Writing is easy to misinterpret so use positive language 
that outlines benefits, breeds confidence, clearly states the intention 
of the communication and manages expectations such as a deadline 
for action or when to expect a follow up call, and do what you say 
you will. Taking the time to write a considered message will leave 
a good lasting impression and save time pursuing business or back-
pedalling from mistakes. By the way, if you do make a mistake, 
apologize quickly, take responsibility and feedback and perhaps 
offer compensation. Rarely, whether in or out of your control, there 
may be nothing you can do that will satisfy some customers, so it 
may be best to move on or, if possible, hand the relationship to a 
colleague.
•	 Communicate Brand - Your brand is your signature so it is important 
to reflect it in a positive light in all interactions. Ensure your website 
and social media profiles are factually accurate, professionally 
written, authentic in colour, style and content, consistently updated 
with clear concise messaging, have keywords optimized for SEO 
and offer sharing and feedback options. People like to share stories 
and experiences that build trust and establish mutual benefit to 
create synergies, build influence and give customers an enjoyable 
experience of working together.

TRANSFORM
96
3. PARTNERSHIP & QUANTUM ENERGY TO  
COLLABORATE
To give your business a quantum leap to the next level, it is highly 
beneficial to develop ‘interconnectivity’ synergies and focused energy 
to create win-win-win partnership situations where your relationship 
wins, your company wins and your project wins:
•	 Source potential partners - Start with logical industry or repeat 
supporters with a vested interest and customer base that buy your 
products or services. Reading industry literature, joining industry 
groups and attending events will develop your database and 
identify new entrants. Reports that affect your industry may be 
available from financial services for example that may be open to 
partnering in exchange for publicizing the report. Be resourceful 
and brainstorm.
•	 Create business-funding partnerships to support project or events 
- This requires resources, excellent preparation, collaboration and 
teamwork, and the better you prepare and set up the project, the 
easier it becomes to execute. Involving more people of course 
requires increased safety awareness, project quality, clear contracts, 
improved cost controls, timely issues resolution and commitment 
guided by the mantras of ‘on time and within budget’ and ‘under 
promise and over deliver’.
•	 Match strategy - Matching corporate strategy to event or service 
strategy, balancing rights and responsibilities with desires, and 
aligning these to measurable tasks that consider risks, are the keys 
to securing partners. Clearly worded helpful information that starts 
with the end goal in mind and fairly treats all offers, will guide 
your vision and influence a positive outcome.
•	 Sell - Selling is often a lengthy process of research that considers 
price, benefits, buy-in from multiple stakeholders, exclusivity, 
marketing goals, product education, speaker participation, optional 
extras and possible internal staff competing priorities which you 
may need to dig deep to understand. Once a proposal is developed 
and sent, use the personal touch to call at a convenient time or meet 
in person to respectfully guide them through their options to create 
tailored ‘outside the square’ opportunities to interconnect.

97
MIND YOUR Ps & Qs TO POLISH YOUR EXECUTIVE SKILLS AND SHINE IN BUSINESS
The entire Ps & Qs process from connection to interaction to 
interconnectivity is a constant and balanced refinement of price 
and benefits to structure a customer proposal that creates a winning 
partnership, enjoyable experience and a feeling of importance and 
future business community success. The challenge is yours to polish 
your executive relationship building, communication and negotiating 
skills to shine in business.

TRANSFORMATION OF THE HEART
CHAPTER 10
TRANSFORMATION  
OF THE HEART
BY AL BARBOUR
“My friend, we have a problem.” Those are words that can overwhelm 
you, especially when they come from your physician after an 
examination and receiving the corresponding test results. The doctor 
was talking, but my mind was racing. I was only grasping a few words 
at a time; “Cardiomyopothy; irregular heartbeats; heart failure.” I had 
known something was wrong with my heart for a while, but now it had 
a name and a diagnosis. 
My family doctor made the referral to the cardiologist—a visit and a 
problem I really didn’t want to face. But there I sat on the exam table in 
my new cardiologist’s office as he showed me the x-rays of my heart. 
Dilated Cardiomyopothy is an insidious disease—an enlarged heart. 
Simply put, the larger your heart becomes, the less efficient it becomes. 
The less efficient it becomes, the more fatigued you feel with increased 
shortness of breath, swelling of the legs, ankles and abdomen. The heart 
cannot pump the blood, so the blood does not get the oxygen it needs. 
So, basically, you begin to suffocate from the inside out. 
As most people do in today’s information-driven world, when I initially 
received my diagnosis, the first thing I did was get on my computer to 
Google “cardiomyopathy.” What I read about the condition scared me 
to death. 

TRANSFORM

At that time I weighed about 260 pounds on a 5’ 10” frame. I was 
enjoying life. I had my golfing buddies and every weekend was filled 
with golf and beer. My wife and I would often have friends over for 
cookouts and get-togethers. We were living for today and having a large 
time. 
When the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy entered my life, rather than 
meet it head on, I took a detour for about 10 years. My cardiologist told 
me to lose weight, quit drinking beer, begin exercising, and take my 
medications. Basically, he wanted me to take better care of myself. I 
was at a distinct crossroads in my life that I didn’t want to face. In fact, I 
even turned away from my wife and family, from the people who loved 
me most. Rather than sharing with them my medical condition, I down-
played it and joked about it. 
Not heeding my doctor’s advice, I doubled down on beer and food. As 
a result, my weight ballooned up to 300 pounds and I remember joking, 
“With proper medication you can live any way you want.” I continued 
to meet with my cardiologist but it was like I was playing games with 
him. He would tell me what to do, and then I would do what I wanted. 
At a time in my life when I had a wife and family who loved me and 
could have offered me the support I desperately needed, I shut them 
all out and continued to live as if nothing was wrong. Sometimes the 
easiest person to deceive is yourself, and I was living proof of that. 
On Mother’s Day in 2000, I got up and told my wife, “Let’s get dressed 
and surprise my parents at church.” They were going to a small church 
in a poor side of town where my mother had grown up. The people were 
mostly mill workers who worked at a local textile mill. The preacher 
was a man who had dedicated his life to God and that community for 
many years. I don’t remember the sermon, but when the invitation came 
from the pastor for anyone who wanted to rededicate their life to the 
Lord, I stood silent. I distinctly remember the choir echoing the most 
beautiful sound I had ever heard. I had been raised in a Christian home, 
baptized at the age of twelve, but when I went to college, I left the 
church and had turned away from God. Now, instead of going to church 
for the right reason, I was there only to please my mother on Mother’s 
Day. Every ounce of my body wanted to step out, walk down the aisle 
and ask Jesus to forgive me and to take me back. Yet I held onto the back 
of the pew, my knees shaking and not being able to breathe. I left that 

101
TRANSFORMATION OF THE HEART
day and allowed that opportunity to pass. For the next several years I 
went through a very dark time in my life. There seemed to be absolutely 
no joy in my life. I just went through the motions.
One day, I remember riding in my golf cart when a group of geese flew 
overhead. I could hear their wings beat the air and could hear their 
distinct honking as they graced the sky. I remember saying, “God, I 
don’t deserve to be able to speak to You. But thank You for letting me 
see how great Your creation is.” At that moment I felt a warmth inside 
me that I had not felt in many years. It was then that I began to realize 
there was something missing in me. There was a hollowness I couldn’t 
fill. Several weeks later, on a Sunday morning, I told Susan, my wife, to 
get up. She inquisitively asked, “Why?” I quickly replied, “We’re going 
to church.” To which she questioned again, “Why?” I said, “Because 
nothing else is working.” I had reached the end of my struggle and I 
knew I needed an answer that was bigger than I was. 
When we walked into Temple Baptist Church that morning, a feeling 
of joy came over me. Words cannot express the feeling of happiness I 
experienced that day. Maybe it was because two of the greatest blessings 
of my life were about to happen. The first was that I was going to be 
in church for the right reason, to worship God with my father, mother 
and wife. The second was that my wife, Susan, would accept Jesus as 
her Lord and Savior and join the church. God had blessed me with a 
wife who loved me, supported me, and now was following me into the 
church.
We immediately joined the church and later I became a Sunday school 
teacher for a men’s adult class. Our marriage grew stronger and sweeter 
and I saw my wife in a new light. A real transformation had taken place 
in my life. 
But the cardiomyopathy was still there and my heart began to fail in 
January 2011. By June of that year, I began to vomit. The doctor said I 
was entering the final stages of heart failure. My cardiologist told me he 
had done all he could for me and referred me to UNC Heart Transplant 
Center.
There is a process to qualify for a heart transplant that begins with a 
series of tests and a review panel to determine if you are a candidate. 
After being deemed a qualified candidate, on July 7, 2011, I entered 

TRANSFORM
102
UNC Hospital and checked into the Heart Transplant wing. To be listed 
as A1, you have to be receiving two types of medication. This is done 
through a peripherally inserted central catheter or PICC in one arm and 
another in your neck. Both have lines that go directly to each side of 
your heart to pump the necessary drugs to stimulate your heart to beat. I 
was also hooked up to three or four monitors and all other sorts of wires 
– making even the slightest movement quite an ordeal.
Then you wait. And you think. It begins to dawn on you that you’re 
waiting for someone else to die so you can have their heart and live. 
Lying on your back, looking up at the ceiling only reinforces your 
feeling of complete and total helplessness. Before, time seemed to pass 
so quickly; but lying there in such a vulnerable state caused time to just 
stretch out before me. Days seemed to lose their meaning. The reality of 
my situation began to settle in; either I would get a heart or I would die. 
Time was not on my side. 
I was a Christian believer, a Sunday School teacher, a Deacon at my 
church, yet I was afraid. Each morning, a parade of doctors would come 
by and check my status. Each day became another day on the waiting list. 
After several weeks, my heart continued to decline and the medication 
was failing. The situation was looking very bleak to say the least. 
I was reading my Bible daily, and one day read Psalm 16: “Keep me 
safe, O God, for in you I take refuge.” The words took root in my heart 
as if the Holy Spirit planted them there. Later that Friday, my doctor 
told me I was running out of time and they would have to do something. 
They were contemplating putting me on a heart machine. The transplant 
coordinator came by and I asked where I stood on the donor list. She 
told me I was 20th in the Southeast. Needless to say, I was devastated. 
Later that evening after my wife and mother had left for the day, I wept 
uncontrollably. I had reached the end. I remember opening my Bible 
up to Psalm 16 again, “Keep me safe, O God, for in you I take refuge.”
I realized then that there was part of me that I had never surrendered to 
God. Part of me was still trying to take care of me. I prayed, “I cannot 
handle this anymore. Let me abide completely in You.” Instantaneously, 
peace came over me. At that very moment I knew and understood it was 
all right. No matter what happened, whether I lived or died, it was going 
to be OK. 

103
TRANSFORMATION OF THE HEART
The next day at 5:30 in the afternoon, the head transplant nurse came to 
my room and told me they had a heart for me in Orlando, Florida. They 
were going to fly down that night, harvest the heart, and put it into me at 
4:30 Sunday morning, July 24, 2011.
My brother was there when I got the news about my new heart. He 
immediately called his wife and I called mine. They picked up my 
mother and came to the hospital. People from the church also came to 
my room that evening as I was being prepared for surgery. My room 
was full of friends and family laughing, talking and praying. Fear was 
not present at the time I had feared the most. The thoughts about when 
they would split open my chest, take out my heart and put another one 
in always kept me up at night. But it turned out to be the most peaceful 
experience of my life. If you ever wondered if prayer works, I’m here 
to tell you it does! Many people were praying for me and I rode those 
prayers that night, down to the operating room.
God guided the hands of the surgeon and I rode those prayers back to the 
recovery room. When I awoke from the surgery, the first words I said to 
my wife were, “I can breathe again.” I stayed in the hospital seven more 
nights before being released. 
I wish I could say that closeness with God never changed, but it seems 
that the stronger we get, the less we think we need God. I came to realize 
that drifting from God is not because God moves away from us, it’s 
because we move away from Him. God gives us all a choice. Just as 
in any relationship, we have to work on our relationship with God, not 
once a week, but daily. Unfortunately, I came home with a new heart 
and renewed health, but with the same mind and the same weaknesses. 
After a few months I had drifted back to eating the wrong foods and my 
closeness with God was not the same. 
There’s a passage in the book of Colossians that says, “Whatever you 
do, work at it with all your heart, as if working for the Lord.” This verse 
resonated with me and I wrote it down on a yellow legal pad so I would 
remember it. I asked myself, “How can I translate this verse to relate 
to every aspect of my life; God, family, friends, career, people in my 
career, people God puts in my path, and even myself?” 
First, I purposed to make God part of everything I do in my daily life, 
not just part of Sunday. Secondly, I determined to start every morning 

TRANSFORM
104
asking God to use me for His purpose that day and to help me see what 
He would have me see, hear what He would have me hear, feel what He 
would have me feel and do what He would have me do. Third, I pledged 
to give thanks throughout the day. The simple fact that Christ is for us is 
enough to outweigh any bad day. 
Further, I have committed myself to the following 10 Daily Resolutions. 
I find these resolutions influence not only my personal life, but also the 
way I conduct my business and relate to others. 
1.	 I will put the interests of others before my own (Philippians 2:3)
2.	 I will speak less and listen more. (James 1:9)
3.	 I will pray without ceasing for the spiritual needs of others, no 
matter their plight, background or circumstances. (Philippians 
4:6-7)
4.	 I will put the needs of my family above my own. (1 Timothy 3:5)
5.	 I will not let success or failure enter into my consideration. 
(Colossians 3:23-24)
6.	 I will not be judgmental of others. (James 1:12) 
7.	 I will lead a quiet life, take care of my business and work as long 
as God gives me the privilege. (1 Thessalonians 4:11)
8.	 I will not worry about tomorrow, but rather, live each day as if it 
could be my last. (Matthew 6:24)
9.	 I will get up each morning knowing I am one step closer to my 
home in heaven. (Philippians 3:12-14)
10.	 I will give thanks at the end of each day for God’s faithfulness and 
forgiveness. (Ephesians 2:8)
I have thankfully experienced two major transformations; one physically 
and one spiritually. Interestingly, the physical heart I received enabled 
me to continue to live my physical life like everyone else. I no longer 
weigh over 300 pounds, I weigh 171 pounds and I run/walk 5 miles a 
day. Thankfully, I can do whatever I want physically because of the 
generosity of a family in Orlando who went through the very painful 
loss of a 25-year-old family member. That heart enabled me to breathe 
and physically live again. But, the transformation that took place in 
my spiritual and emotional heart changed how I look at life, people, 
relationships, work and everything that I encounter on a daily basis. 

105
TRANSFORMATION OF THE HEART
Both transformations were vital to me. Christ died for my sins, another 
man died that I might continue to live. God has a purpose for each one 
of us. If you want to transform your life, help someone else transform 
theirs and your life will change forever.

EMBRACING CHANGE AND TRANSITION
CHAPTER 11
EMBRACING CHANGE  
AND TRANSITION
BY BRIAN BLACK
As I lay in bed, my mind began to race thinking about what the doctor 
was going to say about my newborn son. It had only been a couple of 
hours since Caden was born, but I knew something wasn’t right. They 
had kept him in the nursery for an extended period of time throughout 
the night and most of the next day. During that time, the doctor informed 
us that Caden was going to be transported to another hospital two hours 
away for testing and further evaluation. As we got up early the next 
morning to make the trip, I still knew nothing about his condition. My 
only concern was getting to the hospital and finding out what was going 
on. My anxiety continued to escalate the closer I got and did not know 
what to expect when I saw him. 
After going through the check-in process, I made my way up the elevator 
following the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) directional signs on 
the wall. It was a maze that seemed to go on forever. When I arrived 
at the nurse’s station, I told her that I was here to see Caden Black. 
I showed her my wristband and they allowed me through the doors. 
Because of the risk of infection, I had to put on a sterile gown over my 
clothes and wash my hands in a sterile sink with soap and water for at 
least thirty seconds – which seemed like an eternity. The nurse led me 
over to where Caden was lying in a crib wrapped up in blankets with 
a baby cap on his head. When I saw him, I was overtaken by the heart 
monitors, IV’s, and feeding tube that was attached to his small cheek and 

TRANSFORM
108
that had been inserted into his nose. The first thing I noticed was that he 
was so weak that he couldn’t grip my finger like a normal newborn. His 
lack of muscle tone was so severe that he couldn’t even smile or hold his 
eyes open. He was unable to eat on his own and received the nutrition he 
needed through his feeding tube. As I sat and watched him sleep, I felt 
helpless not being able to help him in any way. 
After seventeen long days of Caden’s short life, he made enough 
progress where he was able to go home. Days later, I received a phone 
call from his doctor and vividly remember standing over his crib when 
receiving a final diagnosis. The conversation was short, but he informed 
me that Caden had what they call Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The 
characteristics of PWS is low muscle tone, short stature, cognitive 
disabilities, problem behaviors, and chronic feeling of hunger that can 
lead to excessive eating and life-threatning obesity.
I began to struggle with the question of “Why Me?” My thought was that 
this experience is something that was supposed to happen to everyone 
else, not Brian Black. This is not what I had written in my “blueprint” 
for my life. My son was supposed to be the strong little guy that hit 
home runs and ran up and down the basketball court. He was going to be 
the star soccer player and be the fastest kid on the block. Academically, 
he was going to make good grades and excel in everything. However, 
that was not going to be the ultimate plan. My blueprint was changing 
and my life was about to be transformed forever.
That was eleven years ago, and I have learned more from Caden than 
he will ever learn from me. Even though he still has challenges ahead 
of him, I take one day at a time and dwell on what he CAN do instead 
of thinking about what he CAN’T. He does what he can with what 
circumstances he has been given. He has achieved MUCH more than I 
ever imagined at this point in his life, and I’m confident he will continue 
to thrive because of his desire to overcome his disability. One thing is 
for sure: Caden is going to make a difference in the lives of others and 
is going to excel in what he does in his own unique way.
So, how have I learned to embrace this type of change and transition in 
my life? Well, I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I’ve come to 
realize that learning is an option. Therefore, I’ve tried to look back and 
learn from different experiences where I’ve gone through adversity and 

109
EMBRACING CHANGE AND TRANSITION
apply them to my life.
I want to share five words that I’ve used to help me find value in who 
I am, and experience victory in what I do. I believe these words define 
what we must learn in order to build a foundation for adjusting to change 
and reaching our full potential.
THE 5 D’S OF DIRECTION
(1). Desire: “Getting What You Want”
We all desire something in our lives. Last year I wanted to challenge 
myself to compete in what they call a “sprint triathlon.” Now, this is not 
the Ironman that you often see on television, but a shorter version that 
consists of swimming, biking, and running a shorter distance. I knew it 
would be a big commitment, but I had the desire to discipline myself 
and be consistent in my training. After 4 months of preparation for the 
competition, I felt as if I was ready. I studied the race map in detail and 
developed my plan. As the gun fired and I went into the water to begin 
my swim, I was unable to see anything! Although my goggles were in 
place and I felt prepared, I began to panic. It seemed as if everyone was 
trying to swim on top of each other as I was kicked and pushed around in 
the water. Understand, I had read about strategy for the different stages 
of the race, but nowhere did it say that I might drown during the swim! 
As I tried to survive, it began to make sense. Training in the clear pool 
where I could see everything was much different than swimming in the 
open water. 
After swallowing half the river, I finally made it to what they call the 
“transition” area where you prepare for the next stage of the race. I had 
all my gear organized on a towel beneath my bike that was on the rack 
and ready to go. I put on my helmet, shoes, and jersey and was off. As I 
began pedaling and increasing speed, I noticed that I had more energy. 
What was different and why all of a sudden did I feel more focused? The 
answer is that my “transition” to the bike and the run had been perfect. I 
was ready for the changes and made the adjustments I needed to make. 
Unlike the water, I had a clear vision of where I was going. I knew that 
with my desire to finish, I would be able to pace myself to the end.
Every day we get up and go in some direction. Whether it is left, right, 
or straight ahead, there is a course. However, from the very beginning 
I was thrown off my course, and wasn’t able to recover. I will be the 

TRANSFORM
110
first one to admit, that it was a bad experience. However, through 
experiencing one bad thing, I was still able to make the transitions I 
needed in the middle of the race to conquer the course. The question is, 
“Are you change ready? Do you have the desire to make transitions in 
your life?”
(2). Dedication: “Forget It and Drive On”
F.I.D.O…. Don’t be mistaken, I’m not referring to a dog here! I’m 
talking about being determined to achieve something, and if you fail, 
“Forget It And Drive On.” I took this a step further when I was playing 
college baseball at Baylor University. Under the bill of my hat I wrote 
the initials F.I.D.O. to help me remember that if I made an error during 
the game or struck out, I needed to forget about it and take advantage of 
the next opportunity. While playing for Baylor, I estimated that I played 
in close to 275 games. During a game, I would normally get four times 
to bat, which means that I had 1,100 at bats during my career. Let’s 
assume that the pitcher threw me an average of four pitches every time I 
went to bat. That results in being thrown 4,400 baseballs while trying to 
get a hit! You’re now probably wondering how many of those baseballs 
did you actually hit! Well, if you know anything about baseball, you 
know that you are considered to be a successful hitter if you can get a 
hit three out of every ten times. That leaves seven times where you’re 
either going to strike out or not get a hit. It can be frustrating, especially 
if it happens seven times in a row! I’ve been there and if you think about 
it too much and let it get in your head, things may only get worse. So, 
I had to have a short memory and remember that if I didn’t do as well 
as I wanted on the first time I went to bat, that I had three other chances 
throughout the game. That’s where F.I.D.O. became part of my mental 
game, and it was just as important as the physical. It would remind me 
that regardless what happened on the field, I had to keep a level head 
in order to perform for the entire nine innings of the game. I had to 
be dedicated to go out every day and keep swinging the bat and never 
giving up. Still today, every time I walk in my office, I see my hat in a 
glass case and it reminds me of the many times I had to look under it 
and read those four letters to have the dedication I need to succeed in 
all that I do! 
(3). Determination: “One Foot In Front Of The Other”
I remember when Caden was two years old. We had him riding a horse 
to increase the strength of his spinal column and create better balance. 

111
EMBRACING CHANGE AND TRANSITION
Because of his weakness, Caden didn’t walk for the first time in the 
living room like most kids. He walked for the first time after getting 
off a horse! It was an alternative way to help him create the balance 
and strength he needed to accomplish a task. He had to put one foot in 
front of the other in order to begin building the muscles in his legs. He 
showed determination that he wanted to overcome the inability to walk. 
Determination is a powerful tool and it must be a mental part of who 
we are in order to achieve the goals that we have. Where there is a will, 
there is a way!
(4). Discipline: “Getting Where You Need To Go”
Without discipline, you have nothing. If you have no mission, you go 
nowhere. Without implementation of thoughts and ideas, there will 
never be action. Without action, you will only waste your time. It’s like 
training for a marathon. You become disciplined to work out every day, 
but after the race you quit your routine. At that point, you find yourself 
starting over 6 months later when you could have just maintained the 
shape you were in. Believe me, I’ve been there, done that, and it makes 
no sense!! Maybe it’s something different for you, but I’m sure you can 
identify! If you are going to get what you want out of life, you have to 
figure out what you need, and discipline yourself to get where you want 
to go.
(5). Destination: “The Journey” 
Without a doubt, I know that my life is eternal and my destination is 
well beyond this earth. However, there are many in this world that seek 
to find purpose each and every day and they can’t find it. I truly believe 
that if you can take responsibility for who you are, have confidence in 
what you do, and find the hope that is going to get you where you want 
to go, you will be able to navigate your way down a road that leads you 
to getting the most out of the gifts and talents you have been given. The 
fact is that life is not a smooth highway, it is more like a country road 
with bumps and holes in it. The goal is understanding how to sustain the 
bumps and not get “stuck” in the holes. If we don’t acquire the skills to 
do those things, there is going to be a rough road ahead. But remember, 
just because you see a sign that says SHARP CURVE 300 FT. AHEAD 
doesn’t mean you’re going to end up in the ditch unless you don’t know 
how to make the turn!
Whether it is a career, a relationship, or circumstances we experience in 

TRANSFORM
112
our lives, we will continuously experience change and transition on a 
daily basis. It’s not a matter of if; it’s a matter of when. Personally I’ve 
experienced all three. I’ve been laid off from my job, gone through a 
divorce after sixteen years of marriage, and have a child with special 
needs. I didn’t plan on those things being a part of my “blueprint” for 
life. After these types of life changes, many people ask themselves, 
“Where do I go from here?” I believe that we must focus on answering 
the question of, “Where do I GROW from here?” What will be your 
destination? 
The choice is yours!

THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF A SMILE
CHAPTER 12
THE TRANSFORMING  
POWER OF A SMILE
BY BRIAN BERGH, DDS, MS
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, 
a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.  
~ Mother Teresa
Think back to when you were a child and someone smiled at you. You 
probably smiled right back, didn’t you? Children smile about 400 times 
every day. And it’s been shown that 50% of people will return a smile, 
even to a total stranger.
What is it about a smile that is so important? And why as adults have we 
seemed to forget how to smile? Did you know that adults typically only 
smile 20 times each day? A far cry from when we were children. What 
happens to us as we get older?
Human emotions, including happiness, have been studied for years. In 
particular, smiling has been studied extensively. 
Smiling has a huge impact not only on your health, but it can also 
enhance the success and quality of your relationships, both business and 
personal.
A study at UC-Berkeley looked at yearbook senior photographs. The 
broadness of the students’ smiles was measured and compared to the 
success of their marriages and also how much impact they had on others. 

TRANSFORM
116
Those with broader smiles had both more successful marriages and 
greater impact on those around them. Makes sense, doesn’t it? Smiling 
is the universal language of love and caring.
Another study, from Wayne State University, looked at the pictures 
on baseball trading cards from the 1950’s. Again, the broadness of the 
players’ smiles was studied and shown to have a great impact on their 
future success. This time on how long they would live. Those who had 
broader smiles lived over seven years longer! When you first think about 
it, it doesn’t make sense that smiling would increase lifespan almost 10 
percent. Continue reading, and you will discover some of the reasons 
why this happens.
Smiling people are perceived as looking younger than people with 
neutral expressions, by at least three years. So smiling regularly can 
both extend your life and make you look younger at the same time. 
Maybe a simple smile is the fountain of youth. 
Another study at Penn State University showed that people who smiled 
appeared more likable, more courteous, and more competent. All three 
are important in future success.
Human emotions play a big part in our everyday interactions. When we 
meet someone for the first time, we are judged within the first few seconds. 
How we present ourselves, our dress, our confidence and our appearance 
in that first encounter will likely determine the future of that relationship. 
There are no second chances to make a good first impression. 
To be successful in today’s world, gaining the extra edge is critical. 
Those who smile and show a genuine enjoyment of what they are doing, 
the project they are working on, are felt by others to be easier to work 
with. And people are more inclined to be cooperative with someone 
who smiles. How much does a smile cost? Nothing, nada. Looking 
at the return on investment from a smile, it could possibly be the best 
investment you could ever make. 
Imagine you are meeting someone for the first time. You approach that 
individual and they look at you with no facial expression, no smile. 
What is your reaction? You’re probably not very excited to continue 
that relationship, and it would take a lot of time to overcome that poor 
introduction. 

117
THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF A SMILE
Now, imagine a different scenario. One where the same individual 
greets you enthusiastically (not too enthusiastically, though), with a big, 
genuine smile. Totally different experience, right? How likely are you 
to want to continue that relationship? If you’re like most people, you are 
very likely to want to move forward in that relationship. 
This is the power of a genuine smile. 
A study, reported in Neuropsychologia, showed that our brains may 
very likely be programmed to pay attention to smiling faces. People 
were asked to look at photos of smiling and neutral faces. When the 
pictures were shown again, it was clear that the individuals with smiling 
faces were better recalled than those who were not smiling. We all know 
that messages seen over again stick better in our brains. Think of the 
repetition of products that we see on commercials and other advertising 
and marketing material. Don’t you begin to feel more familiar and 
more comfortable with a product or service the more times you see the 
advertisements? When we meet someone for the first time and smile in 
the interaction, we will likely be remembered at a subsequent meeting. 
With trust being paramount in creating and maintaining a personal or 
professional relationship, being remembered and recognized will help 
increase that trust, increasing future opportunities.
A genuine smile has major health benefits, also. We’ve already seen that 
those who smile broadly will live longer and look younger. Smiling also 
lowers heart rate, reduces stress (by increasing endorphin production), 
creates a better mood and increases productivity. Smiling also reduces 
physical and emotional pain and boosts our immune system, relaxing 
our bodies and allowing the immune system to react quicker and more 
effectively.
What can you do if you don’t feel like smiling? What if you’re “down in 
the dumps” and just don’t want to smile at anyone? Charles Darwin, in 
his Facial Feedback Response Theory, theorized that facial expressions 
don’t necessarily function to show your mind’s mental state, but that 
facial expressions can actually determine your mental state. In other 
words, by smiling, you make yourself want to smile. You’ve no doubt 
heard the phrase “fake it, ‘til you make it” many times, I’m sure. The 
mere act of setting the stage for the feeling you’d like to have will create 
that actual feeling.

TRANSFORM
118
Dr. Michael Levis at Cardiff University used botox injections on 
individuals to keep them from being able to frown. The people in the 
study reported feeling happier and less anxious. Now, I’m not saying 
you should go to this extent, but it does show how much our external 
expressions have on our internal state of mind and feelings. 
If you listen to Brian Tracy speak about self-confidence, you’ll hear 
him tell you that one of the best things you can do is to say over and 
over again “I like myself, I like myself.” There is tremendous power 
in this short and simple statement. The same can be said about your 
smile. Speaking the same words, but substituting “smile” for “myself” 
will give you a great start in confidently showing your smile. “I like 
my smile, I like my smile.” You can even say “I love to smile, I love to 
smile” and change your state of mind. 
But sometimes even great self-confidence can’t overcome the appearance 
of a smile. We can do everything in our own power to improve our smile 
and appearance, yet we can still be self-conscious about our smiles. 
And each and every day we don’t smile to our fullest, we are losing 
opportunities for success.
A recent study looked at both professional and personal success based 
on the whiteness of the teeth. People who had whitened their teeth were 
more likely to be hired and were also more likely to be offered a higher 
salary than those who hadn’t whitened their teeth. Imagine that, whiter 
teeth can improve your chance of getting a job and increase the wage 
you’ll be paid. This study also showed that there was greater interest 
in continuing a personal relationship with people who had whitened 
their teeth. Individuals with whiter teeth are also more likely to have 
greater financial and professional success and are thought to be more 
trustworthy. 
So what if you are self-conscious about your smile? You’re embarrassed 
to smile because of the way your teeth look. Maybe your teeth dull 
and discolored, or maybe your teeth are crooked and mal-aligned, or 
maybe you’re missing some teeth. Many people are in this position. 
They wonder what can be done, what their options are. The great news 
is that you have several options to change all of these.
Whitening teeth has never been easier than it is today. With multiple 
options, anyone above a certain age can whiten their teeth. Many 

119
THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF A SMILE
products, including whitening toothpastes, whitening strips and other 
teeth whitening products can be purchased over the counter. These 
products offer an easy way to whiten and brighten your teeth in the 
privacy of your own home. The amount of change can be slight, but 
enough to make a noticeable change in the appearance of your teeth. 
Whitening kiosks are present in many malls across the United States 
and can make greater changes in the appearance of your teeth. For 
significant changes in the coloration of your teeth, a dental professional 
would be the best professional to see. From take-home teeth whitening 
kits, to in-office treatments, the amount of whitening done by a dentist 
can be much greater than using over-the-counter products. And the dental 
professional can monitor the health of your teeth at the same time.
Whitening your teeth will make them look more attractive and healthy. 
But what if your teeth are crooked or you have missing teeth? These are 
procedures that should be done by a dental professional, your dentist or 
orthodontist. 
Today’s orthodontic treatment to align and straighten teeth is more 
popular with adults than at any time in history. Many adults did not have 
the opportunity to have their teeth straightened when they were children. 
We also see adults who have had previous orthodontic treatment and 
teeth have shifted due to varying factors. With the current advances in 
orthodontic treatment, the stigma of having traditional metal braces 
is a thing of the past. There are more options for a more cosmetic 
appearance of braces than ever before. Clear aligners, clear braces and 
concealed braces (braces behind the teeth), provide adults with more 
choices to align their teeth without the look of traditional metal braces. 
There are even tooth-colored wires available to help reduce any metal 
appearance of the braces. And adult treatment can be done quicker and 
more comfortably than in the past, too. Advances in the orthodontic 
field are creating more and more options for adult cosmetic orthodontics 
every year. And not only are well-aligned teeth more attractive, they are 
also healthier. 
Cosmetic dentistry is another option for people with chipped or worn 
down teeth and severe discoloration of the teeth. Veneers (thin tooth-
colored porcelain covers) or crowns can change both the shape and 
color of the teeth. These changes can be almost instantaneous, often 
taking less than one to two weeks.

TRANSFORM
120
You can now see how much your smile can transform you; not only in 
your personal life but also your professional life. And your smile will 
not only transform you, but will transform those you come in contact 
with, too. If you have something of value to give or sell to others, one of 
the best ways to begin is with a smile. That smile will help get you in the 
door and will allow you to have influence over others; the opportunity 
for you to change the world around you.
The “Butterfly Effect” is a theory that when a butterfly flaps its wings, 
there is a small change in the environment around the butterfly. With 
the proper conditions, that simple flutter of the butterfly’s wings could 
eventually cause a full hurricane on the other side of the world. Think 
of the power a smile, your smile, could have on the world. Just like the 
butterfly, your smile could cause a transformation half-way across the 
world. We can never fully know what change can happen because of our 
actions. Think of the changes you would like to see in your life, the lives 
of your family and friends, the world. And start each interaction with 
one of the most powerful expressions you can ever use – your smile. The 
value of a beautiful and healthy smile can really be considered priceless 
when you look at the opportunities that smile will bring to your life and 
others around you.

CHAPTER 13
AIM HIGHER FOR SUCCESS
BY CARL J. BLACKBURN, O.D.
Looking around the room, I was able to associate names with two of 
these familiar faces, Warner Roberts, a local TV personality and Herb 
Kelleher, the co-founder of Southwest Airlines. We were all gathered at 
The Houstonian Hotel to hear a speech by W. Clement Stone. I was very 
glad to have been invited but I had no clue why I had been invited. I was 
a subscriber to Stone’s magazines, Success Unlimited and PMA Advisor, 
maybe that was the reason. Whatever the reason, I was there to thank 
him; it would probably be my only chance to ever see him in person.
We had been close friends for many years but he didn’t know it. We first 
became acquainted when I started professional school. A friend gave me 
a copy of Success through a Positive Mental Attitude by Napoleon Hill 
& W. Clement Stone. I had never read anything about how to become 
successful. For the first time, I took step back from my life and examined 
where I was going with my life. I was determined to begin using these 
principles of success to improve my life, to improve my chances of 
success. For the first time, I understood that if I was going to become 
successful, I needed to take control of my mind and direct my thoughts 
toward success. My first goal was to graduate from professional school 
and I did.
After graduation, I was employed by several established practitioners. 
I learned a lot from them. Eventually, when I thought I had enough 

TRANSFORM
124
“activity knowledge,” I purchased an optical franchise. I built my 
optical franchise into one of the highest volume locations and eventually 
opened several other franchise locations. Sixteen years following my 
graduation, I had gained a lot of valuable experience running high 
volume optical franchises, had been President of our state association, 
had run a marathon, had a paid-for home with a Porsche in the garage, 
and had two loving daughters and a beautiful wife. I was coasting along 
thinking I was successful.
One day, while talking with one of the founders of the optical franchises, 
I made several suggestions on how we could improve our business. I 
offered these suggestions to him on a fairly regular basis but very few 
of them were ever put into place. After listening to my suggestions and 
probably tiring of hearing them, he said, “If you are so damn smart, how 
come you aren’t rich?” He said it in jest but that thought stuck in my 
mind. He was a multi-millionaire and he was measuring success quite 
differently than I had been. 
I kept thinking about what he said and realized that I was in a rut, certainly 
it was an affluent rut but I knew I needed a new challenge. I thought, 
maybe I haven’t been aiming high enough. Owning a franchise has 
some very positive attributes but it also has some negative aspects. You 
have agreed to run your business by their operating system. Creativity 
and innovation are usually not a big part of any franchise system.
I started thinking about going into another business but rejected that idea. 
It would have been very foolish to throw away my 16 years of optical 
experience. My first employer had a full surface optical laboratory. 
During the five years I was affiliated with his practice, I had learned 
how to manufacture glasses. Thoughts of creating a new optical concept 
with an in-house optical laboratory had been popping into my mind for 
several years but I had never acted on the idea. 
So I stepped back and started looking at the optical business with a very 
critical eye. How could it be improved? What are some important patient 
problems that could be made better? If I could design the perfect optical 
business what would it look like? What do patients complain about? 
Maybe I could speed up the manufacture of glasses so that patients 
could get their new glasses in a few hours instead of waiting for a week. 
Maybe our location should be open from 10am until 8pm…six days a 

125

week so that patients would have access without needing to take off of 
work…and be more accessible. Maybe we should have a super large 
selection of eyeglass frames with each category displayed in a different 
department. Maybe we should have optometrist’s and ophthalmologist’s 
offices located nearby. I could visualize our new optical superstore 
concept in my mind.
I considered every option I could think of…all towards the goal of opening 
the best optical that had ever been created. I immediately started putting 
together a plan of action on a yellow legal pad. I ordered my action plan 
with the highest priority items first…and I refined and worked on my plan 
every day. Some 14 months after I began my plan, we opened the first 
1-hour optical superstore in a mall location. It was a brand new eyewear 
and eye care concept. Would eyewear customers like our new superstore? 
Would it be successful? We had taken a big risk.
The night before our grand opening, we were discussing our prospects 
and I observed that if we could just gross $3000 the first day, we might 
be successful. We had to remain open until 9:30pm that first night, but 
we did make $3000. Customers loved our concept…after selecting their 
eyewear, some watched through the windows as we fabricated their 
lenses; others left with pagers and went shopping until we paged them 
when their new glasses were ready. We were surprised at the volume of 
business we started doing…the first year we grossed over $2.5 million. 
We were the highest grossing optical in the USA.
We began making plans to expand our Eye+Tech optical superstore 
concept. We started construction on three locations. As we were nearing 
completion, misfortune struck, our financing fell through. We were 
suddenly scrambling to make payments so that we could get these new 
locations open. I sold my franchises, invested my savings, maxed my 
credit cards…raising just enough money to just get the doors open. We 
were in a serious financial situation.
My Eye+Tech financial mess was the reason why I was at the Houstonian 
Hotel meeting. My financial mess was why I wanted to personally thank 
W. Clement Stone. During those months and months of financial anxiety, 
every night, for me to keep a positive mental attitude, I reread Success 
through a Positive Mental Attitude. I thought about the principles and 
concepts found in that book. I knew that with PMA I could attract 

TRANSFORM
126
solutions to my financial problems. Eventually, we thought up some 
successful promotions that improved our cash flow. Our patient volume 
began growing. We started making money. We began to work our way 
out of our financial problems but we still had a long way to go.
Trying to raise additional funding, we put together a presentation binder 
and started visiting different venture capital groups. We took a lot of 
time with our presentation binder with bios, photos, expansion plans 
and projections. We knew the optical business and we wanted our 
presentation binder to reflect our experience, abilities and prospects. 
Unfortunately, we really had no luck with the venture capital people. 
They wanted a lot more of the company than we were willing to give.
One day, in my office, the telephone rang. When I answered, a gentleman 
told me his name and said he would be in Houston in a few days that 
he was with a company that had some interest in the one-hour optical 
superstore business. We set up the meeting and thanks to our presentation; 
we had a new partner, The Gillette Company. They purchased a 40% 
interest in our company plus agreed to fund our expansion plans.
Gillette was a great partner. We started opening stores and in a few years 
we had built and opened 22 Eye+Tech optical superstores in six states; 
Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, California and Washington. I 
was the Chairman of the Board and the CEO of the company.
It was during that time that the Houstonian Hotel meeting occurred. 
At that meeting, during a break, I approached Mr. Stone, introduced 
myself, and told him my story about starting Eye+Tech. I discussed how 
I had gone through some very tough times getting started and keeping 
it going. How by reading his books and articles, he had helped me to 
control my thoughts. How PMA had put me and kept me on the road to 
success. How we were now enjoying great success, opening stores and 
making money. I told him how I felt without his help I couldn’t have 
made it and that I wanted to sincerely thank him for all he had done for 
me. When I finished, his eyes sparkled, and with a big smile and his 
booming voice, he congratulated me and shaking my hand, said, “I bet 
you would like to hug me for that.” I said that I believed that I would 
and…I did…and we both laughed and had a celebration of success.
I didn’t realize it at that time, but about 2 years after my conversation 
with Mr. Stone, I would undergo another severe test. We had continued 

127
AIM HIGHER FOR SUCCESS
building and opening Eye+Tech stores. We had developed a system 
where in 90 days after signing the lease we could have a store up and 
running. We had 38 stores, when Gillette came to me with some bad 
news. They were undergoing a takeover attempt and wanted to sell all of 
their investments except the razor blade business. They needed the cash 
to buy their own common stock.
With that conversation, I had gone from opening and managing 38 
Eye+Tech stores to trying to sell the entire business. I wasn’t happy 
about that but I was determined to get the job done. By controlling my 
thoughts and always keeping a Positive Mental Attitude, I changed my 
focus towards making the best of our situation.
In 6 months, I was able to find a buyer and close the deal. Despite the fact 
that a leading investment banking firm had valued our company at $18 
million, I sold Eye+Tech to a large optical corporation for $32 million.
It was just 7 years from the day I first started creating the Eye+Tech 
concept until we sold the company. Those thoughts, ideas, plans plus a 
lot of hard work by me and my Eye+Tech colleagues were worth $32 
million. My goal in aiming higher had been achieved.
I want to share some ideas to help you achieve success: 
1.	Never be satisfied at where you are in your life. Always be 
progressing towards some greater goal…always be aiming higher.
2.	Look at your business or profession with a very critical eye. Ask 
yourself, how can your customer’s experience be improved? 
Search for ideas to improve some aspect of your business. Look 
for ways to do something to better serve people. Become a leading 
expert in your field.
3.	Immediately begin writing down all of the ideas that come to you. 
Keep them organized by category. Remember everything that 
exists today, first started as someone’s thought or idea. Ideas are 
always out there but you must tune yourself into them. If you are 
creating, the ideas will come to you. Immediately write down and 
act on these ideas.
4.	Develop a written plan of action. Prioritize the items in your plan. 
Associate a time schedule with each item in your action plan.

TRANSFORM
128
5.	Put aside everything in your life and focus solely on following 
each part of your plan towards success.
6.	Expect that something unexpected could happen and if it does, 
work your way through the problem by controlling your thoughts 
with PMA.
7.	Read personal development and positive motivational books and 
articles. Listen to audio tapes. Attend and learn from seminars. 
Keep your mind charged with PMA.
I wish you well on your journey to success…I only ask one favor…
That you begin your success journey at this very moment!

CHAPTER 14
SALES PROMOTION:  
TRANSFORMING YOUR  
BUSINESS FROM  
SURVIVAL TO THRIVING
BY DANETTE GOSSETT
My first encounter with marketing occurred when I was14 years old and 
was asked to participate in a focus group. I, of course didn’t know what 
a focus group was at that time. Turns out it’s a guided group discussion 
about a product, service, ad campaign, political campaign or just about 
anything you’d like feedback about. Would you buy the product if they 
said this, use a service if you heard a particularly phrased testimonial, 
or even as simple as choosing one color over another? My first focus 
group experience was to comment about the new design of a soda can. 
I found it fascinating.
The president of the marketing research company was my church youth 
group leader, so I was asked to participate in many groups over the next 
few years. And I became more and more intrigued by all the elements 
that went into marketing a product or service. 
I started working for the company the summer after I turned 16 and 
for all the summers and breaks through college. I conducted telephone 
surveys (this was when you really didn’t mind someone calling you and 
asking questions – people wanted to talk to me); I did on-site intercepts 
SALES PROMOTION: TRANSFORMING YOUR BUSINESS FROM SURVIVAL TO THRIVING

(asking people questions in a mall or in front of a theme park) and even 
door-to-door surveys. 
In college I studied marketing management and market research and 
after graduation headed to New York City to work on Madison Avenue 
in some of the best-known advertising agencies. I was fortunate to work 
on many well-known national brands developing not only advertising 
campaigns, but also direct mail and sales promotion programs. 
Initially, I resented working on the non-advertising marketing initiatives 
because I thought they were not as important or impactful (or as much 
fun as shooting on location in Hawaii) as a television commercial. 
After many years in the “business” I came to realize that my early 
training in all marketing tactics, and especially sales promotion, was 
going to be the key to my long-term success. I learned how a fully-
integrated marketing campaign could literally transform a company 
from survival to thriving. 
I’ve learned that most people are confused about what “marketing” 
is. When I introduce myself the first response is, “Oh, you must be in 
Public Relations,” or “You must be with an advertising agency.” I’ve 
never been in PR and while I do advertising within a sales promotion 
program at times, I’m not an advertising agency, so that confuses people 
even more.
Basically, marketing is everything your company does to attract 
business. From the development of the logo and business card and 
website to advertising campaigns, public relations, social media, 
collateral materials, direct mail, sales promotions and more.
Of course, there are businesses that specialize in one or several or all 
of those marketing tactics. They are there to help you maximize your 
budget and make sure you are utilizing the best tactics for your business 
success.
Over the years I have narrowed my focus to mainly concentrate on sales 
promotion programs.
Why? I’ve always found that sales promotion is a key component of 
most marketing plans and I can be very creative in their development. 

133
SALES PROMOTION: TRANSFORMING YOUR BUSINESS FROM SURVIVAL TO THRIVING
Sales promotion by nature is designed to change the buying behavior 
of a target audience to purchase something NOW, not in the future. In 
other words, it’s a short-term incentive designed to create an immediate 
need and transform the “looker” into a buyer. 
For example, how many times have you opened your Sunday newspaper 
to see a coupon for something you don’t necessarily need right now, but 
the offer enticed you to buy now. I recently responded to a “60% off 
framing for this week only” offer. It was on my list of to do’s but it 
didn’t have to happen right away. That was an effective sales promotion 
in reaching me and getting me to respond immediately.
So how do you develop an effective sales promotion that reaches your 
target customers and transforms them into happy customers now? 
First, you need to know who your best customers are. The loyal most 
profitable customers are the ones that you want to profile, not just someone 
that shops your loss leaders every week. If you don’t have your customer 
profile defined, then it’s time to develop a clear understanding of your best 
target customer including their basic demographics, psychographics as 
well as what they buy, at what price, when and how often.
Understanding your target customer will help you in developing an 
effective sales promotion that will “speak” specifically to their needs 
and thereby increase your overall response rate and sales.
Sales promotions are an effective means for bringing in new customers, 
moving customers away from the competition, getting loyal customers 
to buy more or try another product or service, stimulating business 
during slow times and many other needs that require a change in the 
customers’ behavior. 
For instance, you have a sales plan with a quarterly sales goal and at the 
start of the third month of the quarter your sales are flat. What do you do?
An effective sales promotion can bring a quick traffic-building boost 
to your quarter. How many times have you seen an automobile dealer 
running specials at the end of a quarter? Maybe a special financing deal, 
special sale price if purchased before the 1st or low down payment offer, 
all designed to get their target customers in the door to buy now. That’s 
a sales promotion offer.

TRANSFORM
134
What about attracting a new audience to your business? Not long ago 
we developed a promotion to bring more group meeting business to a 
cruise line. Their research indicated it was a good fit for their business, 
but this audience had been solicited several times before with little or 
no success. 
We determined this target needed a longer explanation to achieve the 
level of understanding of the benefits the cruise line could bring to their 
group meetings. Because of the message length, we decided to use direct 
mail to deliver the promotional offer. It included a multi-level box, gift 
and an offer of a free cruise so they could experience all that the cruise 
line had to offer their group meetings.
It was very well received, achieving an 8% response that ultimately 
translated into more than $10MM in sales. It was their highest return on 
investment (ROI) of any promotional offer that year.
As you can see, a sales promotion can be extremely varied. They can 
include:
•	 Buy-One-Get-One Free Offers: BOGO’s – many retailers utilize 
this offer regularly
•	 Discount or Money-Off Coupons or Vouchers: In the newspaper, 
flyers, downloadable from a website; $1.00 off your next 
purchase
•	 Gift with Purchase: Buy a full size, get the travel size free; buy a 
razor get a shave cream sample for free
•	 Free Promotional Gift: Your logo-branded promotional gift; stop 
by our trade show booth and receive a free calculator, travel mug, 
USB
•	 Free Samples: Tastings of food or drink at supermarkets; free 
sunscreen at festivals; hand sanitizer at the mall

SALES PROMOTION: TRANSFORMING YOUR BUSINESS FROM SURVIVAL TO THRIVING
•	 Contests: Create a recipe and be entered into a chance to win a 
new Kitchen – you have to “do” something to be entered, just 
entering a drawing is a sweepstakes
•	 Cause-related efforts: A wine company donates 50% of the 
proceeds to a charity
•	 Finance deals: 0% financing for 5 years on selected vehicles; 
lower down payment
•	 Upgrades: Rent an economy car for 7 days and get upgraded to 
mid-size
•	 Service offers: Free delivery; free training
However, be careful that sales promotions are not your only marketing 
tactic, because constantly running a sales promotion can have an impact 
on your overall brand image.
The long-term benefits of a well-thought out and executed sales 
promotion program can build your short term sales success, help to bring 
in new customers and build on your desired brand image. However, on 
the negative side, a poorly-managed promotion could negate your long-
standing positive brand position.
For instance, you introduce a sales promotion with a limited time 
restriction “for this week only” offer. If you repeatedly extend the time 
restriction then your customers will realize that the sale price is just 
the new price thus negating the purpose of the promotion, bringing 
in immediate sales. It can also alter the perception of your company 
and the quality of your products or services, effectively changing your 
company to being seen as a strictly “discount” brand. Now, you can run 
a weekly promotion, just make sure it’s a different product or service 
being offered each time. 
Are you ready to boost your sales and transform your business from 
survival to thriving? Here are 3 promotional tactics that have proven to 
be effective for a wide variety of businesses, big and small:
1. Create An Added-Value Promotion
This strategy can utilize any number of the various tactics listed 
above. For this to be most effective it’s best to know what your 
competitors are offering and go bigger. Maybe you don’t want to 
discount or discount as much as your competitor and get into a 

TRANSFORM
136
pricing war. So an alternative is to add value. In other words, giving 
your customers something they would value, want or need when 
they make their purchase. For instance, a gift card (dollar amount 
would be dependent on the value of the sales item of course), free 
delivery, tickets to a local event, movies, e-books, music downloads, 
free gift (not necessarily a sample size, but something that would 
complement what they are purchasing). For example, with gas 
prices so high today many retailers are offering a free gas card with 
purchase. A friend of mine is now a new and loyal customer of one 
retailer because of that very sales promotion.
2. Give a Surprise Reward
This is similar to the added value promotion and could be many of the 
same items but the “gift” is a surprise your customers receive with 
their purchase. This promotion is not communicated ahead of time, 
hence the “surprise”. Being a surprise engages customers and thanks 
them for their business and loyalty. It gives you an opportunity to 
exceed their expectations thus thwarting any of your competitor’s 
future promotional efforts to steal your now more loyal customers. 
My friend with the gas card now shops regularly at that retailer and 
is constantly telling me of the upgrades or free gifts she receives 
with purchase. The advertised free gas card promotion brought her 
in and the surprise “rewards” are keeping her more loyal. I asked 
if she’d keep going back if the gas cards are eliminated, she said 
“absolutely.”
3. Social Media is Talking
As we all know, social media can be a highly effective way to reach 
your customers. So why not get them talking about you! You may 
have an active social networking community that can help extend 
your message to an even broader audience. Are you using it? Are 
you familiar with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, 
Google+, Foursquare, Flickr, WhatsApp or any of the almost daily-
added options? If not, it’s time to get your feet wet! I am sure we’ve 
all seen some of the recent campaigns that moved events from social 
media to the evening news! The possibilities are endless. We had a 
national ice cream brand recently give free samples away at a local 
outdoor mall. It was only mentioned on twitter and they had people 
lining up for blocks and it made the evening news. At the event they 
gave coupons for a discount on the next purchase. I am sure the 

137

promotion was duplicated in many markets and was quite successful 
in increasing sales.
For any promotion, just make sure it’s something that makes sense 
for your customer. Think about what would motivate them to 
purchase from you and you are on your way to transforming your 
business to greater success.

IT’S ONLY HALFTIME—THE 7-STEP PLAYBOOK TO TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE
CHAPTER 15
IT’S ONLY HALFTIME— 
THE 7-STEP PLAYBOOK TO 
TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE
BY DR. ANDREAS BOETTCHER
Having been an entrepreneur since my early 20’s, I had the good fortune 
of experiencing a great deal of success as a chiropractor, real estate 
investor, network marketer and Ironman triathlete. Life was great and 
exciting, having built several million-dollar businesses by the age of 
38. However, in 2009, with the downturn in real estate and some tough 
decisions, I reset every aspect of my life. Essentially, I lost everything, 
went through a divorce, and even underwent emergency back surgery 
in less than a year; turning me from “Ironman” to “aluminum 
man” seemingly overnight. I had no choice but to reinvent myself 
professionally…but how? I had no working capital, a severe back injury 
and not to mention just moved to a new state.
This is when I discovered the key to dealing with these challenging 
times in life. It is to focus on positive knowing, not just positive 
thinking. After all, I was successful before and knew that I could do it 
again. That’s positive knowing – using your knowledge and experience 
to catapult you to a new level of success. Never to be stripped away. 
Unless you allow some event, circumstance or person to take it? Only 
you hold that power.

TRANSFORM
142
IT’S ONLY HALFTIME
We all have opportunities in life that resemble halftime at your favorite 
sporting event. While the crowd is enjoying the halftime entertainment, 
the players are taking that time to ReSet, ReFuel, and ReCommit. 
“Halftime” is an opportunity for new decisions and new actions for a 
life and business you love. Whether you are up by 20 or down by 20, 
how will you come out of the tunnel for the second half? 
It’s Only Halftime is a story of transformation and reinvention. It’s 
about embracing change and overcoming complacency. It’s about living 
your true purpose in life and not living life as if it were a dress rehearsal. 
In just a moment I will share with you my abbreviated 7 Step Playbook 
to Transformation. My own transformation has me working with some 
of the biggest brands and success experts in the world today. Leading 
me exactly where I want to be, helping people like you around the world 
live their true passion in life and amplifying their own voice, experience 
and expertise into profits and opportunity for those they serve.
Achievement comes down to the 4 D’s – which are the foundation to the 
7 Step Game Plan. To properly execute the Game Plan, you will need a: 
1. Desire for a new future or result
2. Decision to make it happen
3. Discipline to see it through
4. Determination to Finish Strong
Let’s put on our game face and get it done!
7 STEP PLAYBOOK TO TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE
I. Get clear on what you want. 
Clarity is arguably the single most important word on the road to 
transformation. Fully 80% of your success comes from being absolutely 
clear about what you want to accomplish, even if you’re not sure how. 
The best part about declaring halftime is having the opportunity to 
decide right now what you want. Then ask yourself, “Is what I’m doing 
right now bringing me closer or further away from my goal?” 
Regardless of your story as it reads today, what will your new story be 
for the future? What do you want? Dream as if there are no barriers, 

143
IT’S ONLY HALFTIME—THE 7-STEP PLAYBOOK TO TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE
no limitations and no possibilities of failure. What would you do 
differently? Write them down now in the present tense, as if they were 
already true. 
Now the question is, are you willing to put the work in to make it 
happen? Success always looks easy from the outside but the journey is 
filled with obstacles, challenges, roadblocks and lessons. Remain clear 
and keep your eyes on the prize. You can have just about anything you 
want as long as you are willing to play ‘all-out’ but you must know your 
“end zone.”
II. Why are you not there yet? 
Is it a lack of desire, time, energy, education or resources? Maybe other 
commitments, another job, or naysayers are in your way? Is it someone 
else’s fault, something you feel you deserved but didn’t get? Be honest 
with yourself and do not hold back. Begin writing down a list of all the 
reasons you are not there yet. 
After you make your list, go back and look at all your responses. I’m 
willing to bet every single one of them is just an excuse! 
Accept responsibility for your situation, whether it’s your fault or 
not. Only then can you possess the power to transform. Continue to 
make excuses and those excuses, people or circumstances will forever 
hold you down and frankly, crush your dreams. Remember, declaring 
halftime is an opportunity to ReFocus your thinking and actions!
Success shows no prejudice toward your background, circumstances, or 
education, and it certainly doesn’t care about your excuses. All success 
cares about is how bad you want it. Everything else is commentary. Best 
part, you get to define your own success. If you have a desire to change 
with a strong enough WHY to support it, anything is truly possible. 
Now take that list of excuses and get rid of them for good.
III. Define your WHY before even thinking about HOW!
The biggest mistake I see people making on the road to achievement is 
jumping into the HOW before knowing the WHY. The HOW is where 
the work is, where the hurdles show up, where the doubt sets in and 
where we get swept into the details that tend to derail us from our goals. 
Have you ever suffered from “someday I’ll get to it” or “someday the 
timing will be just right?” Let me guess, you likely have goals fitting 

TRANSFORM
144
into the “someday” category, don’t you? 
Have you ever tried before and failed? Have you given up or quit on a 
goal all together? Have you ever procrastinated on what you should do 
and fallen into your proverbial comfort zone instead? These are all sure 
signs your WHY was simply not strong enough. I would even challenge 
you by saying it simply wasn’t a priority. 
It is absolutely critical you become crystal clear as to WHY you want to 
achieve your goal. Your WHY can’t simply be to “make more money” 
or “lose weight.” That is not a WHY. It’s a weak prayer at best and will 
falter at the first sign of prevailing winds. We’ve all heard the story of a 
mother lifting a car to save her child. That’s a WHY! A WHY produces 
immeasurable strength and taps our Inner Drive that no adversity can 
overcome. The deeper the emotion attached to your WHY, the greater 
the meaning and commitment you’ll have for seeing your goals through.
IV. Draft your team! But be careful whom you let in the “locker 
room.” 
Whatever you do, don’t try to do it alone. The proper support is critical 
to your success. So be very careful whom you’ll let into the “locker 
room.” I think of it like all the crazy media surrounding your favorite 
sporting event. All the silly questions they sometimes ask, along with 
the naysayers and their negative comments. Sometimes the team just 
needs to shut the locker room door and tune it all out. You need to do the 
same. Who will you let into your “locker room?” 
I can’t tell you how many times even close family thought I was crazy for 
choosing to become a chiropractor. They would say, “Why do you want 
to become a quack?” “Why don’t you become a real doctor?” Funny 
how their minds changed when I became one of the most successful 
chiropractors in the country and then had the nerve to ask if they could 
borrow money from me. Or how many times I heard people say to me, 
“You’re crazy for wanting to do an Ironman; why would you want to do 
that?” Only to have them later be inspired to buy some running shoes. 
Be careful whom you share your dreams with and always seek counsel 
not opinion. Far too often we ask opinions of those that have never 
achieved anything. They live a life by default instead of a life by design. 
Certainly they are good people and that lifestyle may make them happy. 
But if you are looking to break free, seek out those who are doing what 

145
IT’S ONLY HALFTIME—THE 7-STEP PLAYBOOK TO TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE
you want to achieve. Find a mentor, a coach or someone who will 
support your vision and goals while leading you in the right direction.
V. Time to “Get in the Game!” A plan without action is a plan to fail.
Now that you are clear on what you want, why you want it, and are done 
with any excuses, it’s time to kick it off! This is where so many aspiring 
entrepreneurs, or anyone with a dream, get hung up – in all the details! 
They get so busy planning and planning that they forget to get in the 
game and kick it off!
Throughout my Ironman career I would often meet people inspired to do 
the same or even your local 5k. Their heart was in the right place, they 
were motivated for change and had a powerful reason for wanting to do 
it. However, they got so busy preparing, they became distracted. They 
would have to buy the right shoes, get the right clothes, buy a workout 
journal, find a coach, and buy all kinds of ridiculous sport drinks and 
so on. Not that some of these aren’t important, but after watching them 
prepare for sometimes weeks at a time, I would often find myself asking 
them, “When are you going to start running?” 
Winners are predisposed to action, even when they don’t have all the 
answers. There will always be details to sort out when you’re on the 
field. But if you never get in the “game,” you’ll never score any points—
much less have any W’s in the win column. Develop your plan yes, but 
don’t forget to action that plan in the process. So let’s get out of the 
locker room and get in the game!
VI. Fuel your Body and Mind!
I learned this lesson early on from my grandfather, who I called Opa. 
My Opa lived an incredible quality of life, never needing prescription 
medications or doctor visits, even up until the day he passed away. He 
lived by eating food out of his garden that would rival any Whole Foods 
grocery store and he exercised daily, walking his German Sheppard 
nearly 5 miles every night. He also rode his bicycle nearly 70 miles 
every Sunday, leaving many behind – including me as 16 year-old 
varsity soccer player. He was in his late 70’s at that time. He also never 
watched TV, listened to the news or liked hanging around “old people” 
because they were all too negative for him. 
He was guardian to his mind and body. I learned and decided then, this 
is how I wanted to age. How do you want age? 

TRANSFORM
146
Today’s life arena requires more focus, energy, discipline and endurance 
than ever before to remain sharp and focused. As entrepreneurs and 
anyone undergoing transformation, we are competing in the modern 
world of life, balancing career, business, family and health, so that we 
may enjoy the rewards of our labor for years to come and with those we 
love the most. Decide today and then ask yourself, “Is what I’m doing 
today supporting my visions for health and vitality for the future?” If 
not, what are you going to do about it? 
VII. Visualize your Success…daily!!
The inspiration behind ever attempting my very first Ironman Triathlon 
hit me while being a spectator at the Arizona Ironman in 2005. The stands 
around the finish line were packed with friends and family cheering on 
their loved ones. The energy was palpable as I watched these incredible 
athletes, one by one, complete a race, in what to many, is unachievable. 
A full Ironman, 140.6 miles all in one day, with only 17 hours to finish. 
This is a 2.4-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bike ride and then a 
26.2-mile run. Athlete after athlete from all walks of life crossed the line 
in sheer joy, pride and an indescribable sense of achievement. Many, 
exhausted by the long grueling day, suddenly found a burst of energy to 
cross the white finish line; a white line that requires months and years 
of preparation to cross. It requires a relentless commitment with long, 
lonely hours of what can feel like endless hours of training. …All for 
one moment in time to hear the voice of Ironman announcer, Mike 
Reilly, utter those words every aspiring Ironman wants to hear, their 
name followed by “…you are an Ironman!” 
I can feel the chills now as I hear these words permanently etched in 
my memory as one of the most crowning physical achievements of my 
life. Every detail is as vivid as if I were sitting there today! I rehearsed 
that image over and over and over again as I was inspired to hear Mike 
utter my name at that very stage the following year. I watched every 
Ironman race I could, many times over, inspired by everyday people like 
you who have dreams, and more importantly, the courage to achieve 
them. Participating were individuals with some of the most incredible 
challenges imaginable; cancer survivors, amputees, paraplegics, 
widowers, survivors of horrific accidents, just to name a few. Out there, 
grinding it out despite their circumstances, when they truly have every 
excuse to eat bon bons on the couch and let life pass them by. But they 
don’t. Instead, they decided this is my life, this is my time and no one is 

147
IT’S ONLY HALFTIME—THE 7-STEP PLAYBOOK TO TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE
going to ever take that away from me. They decided to leave their old 
story behind to tell a new story – a story of perseverance and victory. 
What is your “white line?”
Going for your dreams and being an entrepreneur will always have 
its challenges and its ups and downs. It’s all part of the journey of 
transformation, but it’s the journey that makes life so exciting and 
incredibly rewarding - as long as you never lose focus and hope.
When the bottom fell out on me in 2009, I was tested like never before, 
but as a result grew stronger in the process - like working a muscle in 
a gym or training for a race. As one of my favorite lines in the movie 
Shawshank Redemption states, “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best 
of things and no good thing ever dies.” 
So even when your current circumstances and true potential may 
temporarily be veiled in a sea of challenge, uncertainty and fear, embrace 
who you are and who you aspire to be, but NEVER settle for where you 
are. 
Believe it’s Possible, See it Through and Finish Strong!

LIVING YOUR JOURNEY 
AND USING LIFE’S TURNING 
POINTS AS THE KEY  
TO FUTURE SUCCESS
BY ELIZABETH WEIHMILLER
“We learn something from everyone who passes through our lives… 
Some lessons are painful, some are painless…but, all are priceless.” 
 ~ Unknown
 
How well is your life progressing along the journey your inner self 
envisioned? Grab a piece of paper and take a moment to look back on 
your life up to this point. 
•	 What do you see as the key events in your life? 
•	 Are there points in time that really stand out? 
•	 What would you consider to be your turning points? 
Our past can really help us excel and move into our future. We can’t live 
in our past because then we are not moving forward. The past is the tool 
and textbook for our future. We can’t predict the future, unfortunately, 
but we can take and learn from the lessons of our past. Just like we 
can use textbooks to learn from history, you can use your past as the 
textbook of your life. A key point to remember, however, is to not live in 

TRANSFORM
152
the past, for then you will get stuck and won’t be able to fully embrace 
the future and your true destiny and life path. 
Have you ever considered that we achieve success and fulfill our 
potential through transformation.
I’d like to share my journey to this point, some of the lessons I’ve learned, 
and how they’ve helped in my evolving transformation. Pinpointing 
these has helped me move into the future. You yourself may have had 
similar experiences or they may trigger memories, good or bad, that 
may have taught you different lessons. It’s about looking honestly at 
ourselves. When we give ourselves the respect to admit as humans that 
we make mistakes, we can learn from them. That can only make us 
stronger, building us into the unique individuals we are. 
1. Inner Strength
My parents divorced when I was three years old and I spent time going 
back and forth between my Dad’s house and my Mom’s house. Over time 
both of my parents found someone else and both remarried. Now, like 
Cinderella, I truly gained a step-mom who was not the nicest and that’s 
being polite. She wanted to be in control of everything, she wanted to 
become my mom. Thanks, but no thanks! I already had the most amazing 
mom a girl could ask for. As things developed, some events occurred 
one weekend when I was at my dad’s house and my stepmom had my 
dad and I sit down so she could have a talk with me about whatever I 
had done to piss her off this time, but this time it really pushed her over 
the edge. I ultimately ended up getting kicked out of the house. My mom 
was called and I was brought home. I was seven years old. My mom had 
taught me to be and respect myself and hold on to what I believed and 
I did in this case. I was told I was not welcome back until I apologized. 
I didn’t apologize because I didn’t feel I had done anything wrong and 
did I mention I was seven. No seven-year old knows everything. I think 
that is why they call it growing up and maturing. Let me also mention 
this happened again when I was nine. This situation taught me to have 
inner strength, because it is inner strength that will give you the ability 
to move forward and believe in yourself. 
2. Determination & Sticking to Gut Decisions
Lets jump ahead to middle school. I had not hit my stride in elementary 
school and was labeled, because of that, as not one of the brightest or 

153
LIVING YOUR JOURNEY AND USING LIFE’S TURNING POINTS AS THE KEY TO FUTURE SUCCESS
even most motivated students. Well in the public school systems, it 
follows you as you progress to higher grades. I was lumped in classes 
in middle school with people that just didn’t care and were considered 
troublemakers. They would ask me and try to bribe me to do their 
homework. This got me thinking about the education I was getting 
versus the one I wanted. There was a private school near my house 
and we drove by it regularly, it just called to me. I couldn’t tell you 
what called to me, but it was an intuitive hit that I needed to go there. 
It didn’t hurt that their mascot was the Husky and I happened to have 
a Husky. I approached my mom and stepdad to talk about applying to 
the school and what they thought about the idea of switching schools. 
They supported and encouraged me to follow what I sensed was best 
for me. Now, my step mom got wind of this and decided I should be 
applying to and looking at all the other private schools in the area (and 
there are more than a few). This made me want to rebel and not apply to 
the school I wanted to go to. Thankfully, my mom is amazing and said I 
should still apply and that I didn’t need to apply to any others. She said 
this way I wouldn’t regret not applying but that if I was accepted I could 
then decide whether I wanted to go or not. To this day I remember how 
excited I was when I received the call that I had been accepted. I ended 
up going to the private school and it was the best decision I ever made. 
This was the first time I experienced how fantastic a tool my intuition is.
3. Perseverance because Everything happens for a Reason
End of my junior year of high school, my family – my mom, stepdad 
and I - decided to move to Phoenix, Arizona (yes, I really did have a 
choice in the matter). We did things differently in my house than most. 
However, senior year of high school, my life was changed forever. 
Sonny, my stepdad, was an amazing stepdad. I couldn’t have gotten any 
luckier when he and my mom married. He was always there for me and 
I knew I could turn to him when I needed help. He passed away fours 
days after Christmas 2006. This was quick and unexpected, as he was 
diagnosed with a completely metastasized cancer of unknown origin, 
just three week prior to his death. This taught me a lot and honestly 
really put things in perspective. This experience made me realize that 
each day is really a gift and you don’t know what the next hour, day, 
week, month, or year holds but persevering through what life throws 
at you is the only way to grow and learn. These moments can only 
strengthen you – and yes, in the moment it will likely not seem like it 

TRANSFORM
154
at all. Everything happens for a reason; it may not be until a few years 
down the road, however, that the reason reveals itself. To be honest 
“everything happens for a reason” is not only my favorite saying, but it 
is also my least favorite saying as well. Every time something happens I 
tell myself this and it really helps calm me down and remind me to just 
take a deep breath and continue on my journey. 
4. Confidence 
Following my intuition again, I ended up going to a relatively small 
university tucked in the mountains of Flagstaff, Arizona. Northern 
Arizona University had a unique class in its business school called 
Bizblock. In this class you worked with your team to create a business 
including the full business plan and all the research and work that goes 
with it. This was all leading up to the end of the semester when we 
would be competing to present our business idea to a group of venture 
capitalists. We made it! Of ten business ideas we were one of the four 
selected. This class taught me I was capable of more then I ever imagined 
and it was just the tip of the iceberg. It also made me realize that I was 
not cut out for and didn’t want to go into the “normal corporate 9-5 
world.” I wanted to do more and have a greater impact. 
5. Taking Risks and Intuition
After graduating college a semester early, I decided to join Strategic 
Alignment Partners as an entrepreneur, because I was being drawn 
to it. The company stood for what I wanted. I didn’t listen to the 
naysayers and didn’t want to kowtow to what they thought I should 
do with my life because that was just it! It wasn’t their life. It’s funny 
how everyone wants to give advice on other people’s lives, but won’t 
take advice for their own. I knew that I got bored easily and this was 
a fantastic opportunity with no chance of being bored. I recognized it 
would take hard work with no guaranteed income every two weeks. 
But, I recognized I would get paid in other ways, including the learning, 
opportunities and networks I’d have. I also chose this path because I 
knew it would challenge me and that I’d constantly be “pushed off” the 
proverbial cliff, making me stronger and transforming me in new ways 
and going to new levels. 
6. Using Tools to Grow
I learned a valuable lesson that you always need to be growing and 
pushing yourself to new levels by learning from all sources. The most 

155
LIVING YOUR JOURNEY AND USING LIFE’S TURNING POINTS AS THE KEY TO FUTURE SUCCESS
important part of learning is to really get to know yourself, because 
until you know yourself and transform yourself, nothing else will really 
matter. I found unique ways of delving “deeper” into who I am and 
what I am meant to do in this life. Some of the tools that I have really 
found to be the most helpful for me are TriMetrix® HD, Numerology, 
Astrology (which is very different from what you see in the paper), and 
a unique amazing belief-changing process. These have each helped me 
objectively understand some things that had already happened in my 
life. For example, while I connect with lots of people quickly, I’ve never 
felt like I fit in. I now understand that’s part of my journey and purpose. 
I often take and refer to these insights at least every two months to 
remind myself of my gifts and talents and what I need to avoid to keep 
me on track on my journey.
Numerology has given me a better understanding of my life path and 
destiny as well as things I need to work on at different points in my 
life. My deep dive into Astrology, including the north node, planets, 
signs, and houses have shown how a person can understand their 
special talents that can be turned into professional success as well as 
self-defeating tendencies that could hold you back from fully achieving 
your life purpose. Ultimately, it provides a true, deeper understanding 
of yourself, your hidden talents, and the pesky negative influences that 
could distract you from achieving your true-life purpose. 
The final thing that has had a significant impact on my transformation 
and moving to higher levels is the ability, through a very cool process, 
to change ones subconscious and unconscious beliefs. I have been able 
to shift my mindset in ways that stick and that have allowed me to begin 
moving towards my purpose and not holding myself back. Sometimes 
you need to be open to more unconventional ways that really “pin you 
down” as to your strengths and areas to improve on to really move to 
the next level. 
I would rather know the opportunities for growth than be the person 
sticking their head in the sand and continually getting hit over the head 
with the lessons that need to be learned. 
Which person would you rather be? As they say, knowledge is power. 
Life is all about turning points. You may not know them as they are 
occurring, but if you take the time to go back and reflect, it will help you 

TRANSFORM
156
recognize those crucial turning points of your past, but most importantly 
what you are truly capable of. If you take advantage of all the tools 
available to you – not just the ones mentioned above, but all possibilities 
– there truly are no limits to what you can achieve and where you can 
go. 
As Nido Qubein said: “Your present circumstances don’t determine 
where you can go; they merely determine where you start.”

CHOOSING THE LIFE YOU DESIRE
CHAPTER 17
CHOOSING THE  
LIFE YOU DESIRE
BY CHRISTINE SPRAY
Sometimes people look at me and think I have had everything given to 
me and that life has always been some form of perfect. If you have had 
any level of success, no doubt others have thought the same about you. 
What people don’t often realize is that many successful people have 
a story of transformation and sometimes the transformation is quite 
dramatic. 
In a leadership workshop I did a few years ago, I led the group through 
a lifeline exercise where you plot out your life experiences which made 
you who you are today. Part of this exercise was to draw a picture of 
yourself in 30 seconds. That day, for the first time since grade school, I 
drew a picture of myself. It was a smiley face with a tear coming out of 
one eye. Very few people know why there was a tear in my picture, but 
it was part of my transformational story. 
The information I share with you in this chapter is very personal. There 
is a risk to vulnerability. But I’m willing to take that risk to demonstrate 
how your life can be transformed. Mine was, and I know yours can be too! 
TRANSFORMING A LIFE OF GRIEF TO  
AN ATTITUDE OF GRATITUDE
My life has been filled with tragedy, sadness, and despair. However, I 
have chosen to not stay there. Instead, I made choices that would take 

TRANSFORM
160
me from the conditions from which I came to the places I desired to 
be. Instead of tragedy, I choose triumph. Instead of sadness, I choose 
gladness. Instead of despair, I choose hope. Instead of being a victim, I 
am a victor. Instead of living in grief, I have an attitude of gratitude. You 
see, life can be what is dealt to you or what you decide it will be. It is 
what you want it to be and only you can make that choice for yourself. 
Some people feel comfortable living in negativism, drudgery and an 
overall depressive state. Oh, they will complain about it until the cows 
come home, but they won’t do anything about it. They sometimes enjoy 
the attention it brings them. But not this woman! I refuse to live with a 
victim mentality. Instead, I choose to live a life of blessing and I look at 
every tragedy or negative circumstance that has every occurred in my life 
as an opportunity to gain greater appreciation for all the great things in 
my life. No sitting in the muck and mire of life for me. I choose blessing! 
TRANSFORMING FROM FEAR TO FAITH
To say that I grew up in a dysfunctional family is an understatement. As 
long as I can remember, I lived in fear. I no longer allow fear to dominate 
my life, but I distinctly remember that, while growing up, I feared my 
mother, my past, my present, my future, and life in general. Even though 
my personality is one to love and trust everyone, to this day there are 
occasionally circumstances that will bring back those feelings of fear 
and anxiety. 
Probably because I grew up in a household of overwhelming lack, I have 
always had this almost overwhelming fear of becoming homeless and 
having to live on the streets. In our home, we seemed to lack everything, 
from not having food, to not having money to pay the electric bill. This 
fear of living on the streets actually served as a major driving force and 
motivation for me to go to college so I could obtain a good job and take 
care of myself. 
I knew I could not go on allowing fear to be such a controlling part of 
my life. To deal with this issue, I decided to research fear to understand 
what I could do to overcome it. One of the research tools I used in 
my quest for an answer was a Concordance – which is a dictionary of 
sorts. You can look up a word and it will give you every place in the 
Bible where that word is used. I used that Concordance to look up the 
word “fear” many nights. I would then look up the specific verses in the 

161
CHOOSING THE LIFE YOU DESIRE
Bible to see what it said about the subject. The exercise enabled me to 
overcome my fear by learning that if I truly had faith, I could not have 
fear. 
I made a decision to focus my attention on faith and the knowledge that 
I did not have to live in fear. By faith I was able to accept the difficult 
times of my childhood, leave them behind and focus on what I knew I 
was capable of doing in the future. I was no longer bound by the fears 
that haunted me for so many years. 
TRANSFORMING FROM BEING FATHERLESS  
TO THE FATHER THAT COUNTS
When I was five years old I received a school assignment to go home, 
find out what my daddy did for a living and then come back to school 
the next day to share that exciting information with the entire class. You 
may find this odd, but until that time, I did not know I was supposed to 
have a dad. That day I ran excitedly from the school building to the car 
where my mother was waiting to pick me up. Jumping up and down with 
the excitement of a super-charged five year old with a new discovery, 
I blurted out, “Mommy, Mommy, Mommy…I have a daddy…I have a 
daddy!! Take me to see my daddy!” I was so anxious to find out who he 
was and what he did so I could tell all my friends in school. 
Within a few seconds my mother dashed to pieces my new-found hope 
of a daddy when she said, “You don’t have a daddy. He was killed in a 
car accident.” In just seconds I went from total euphoria thinking I had 
a daddy I never met, to total despair to find out he was killed. 
When I was eight years old, my mother took me, my sister and my 
brother to the cemetery to see where my dad was buried. She shared 
with us what really happened – and that he was murdered. It was a very 
vague story and my young mind didn’t fully comprehend the scattered 
details. That’s really all I ever knew about my father or the circumstances 
that surrounded his death. It was just never discussed.
As you can imagine, growing up without a father was difficult. A single 
mother trying to raise three children was an extreme challenge. There 
were many days I wondered about my father, what he would have been 
like, if he would have taken me on walks, or if I would have been a 
“daddy’s girl.” I later learned that my father passed while my mother 

TRANSFORM
162
was pregnant with me. I also was told that he thought he was having 
another little boy and wanted to name me Christopher, so my mom came 
as close as she could by naming me Christine. Even though I never met 
him, I still miss my daddy to this day. 
The good part of my childhood was that my mother took us to church. 
There, I learned about faith and that there was a God to whom I could 
turn. I grew to understand that we all have a choice about the way we 
live our lives and that there would always be someone who was worse 
off than we were. I also learned about another father, a heavenly Father. 
While I still miss my daddy greatly, I take great solace that I know the 
Father that counts. 
I understand that not everyone who reads this will be able to identify 
with this aspect of my transformation from being fatherless to knowing 
what I term, the “Father that counts.” But it has great meaning to me 
and has been instrumental in setting my course in life. This relationship 
is the basis of my faith, my attitude of gratitude as well as every other 
aspect of the life I now am privileged to enjoy. 
TRANSFORMING FROM BEING FINANCIALLY 
CHALLENGED TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM
While growing up, my family was very poor. If we had food, it was often 
the same meal every day and I never had money for lunch. Anything I 
needed I would have to earn money to buy. I started working when I was 
14 years old, and helped pay the rent and basic utilities. In high school 
I would leave school at 1 p.m. to go to work to support our family. I left 
home while still in high school to live with affluent families where I 
would house sit, clean pools, take care of their dogs, wash their cars and 
water their plants on a daily and weekly basis. 
I did not grow up in an environment that was conducive to producing 
successful offspring. I remember looking at other families that had 
beautiful homes, nice cars, designer clothes, and were polished. I 
couldn’t buy the houses, cars or clothes, but at a young age I taught 
myself how to make my own clothes and even give myself French 
manicures that were better than a professional salon manicure. To this 
day, I do my own nails 95% of the time – it’s just a carry-over from my 
childhood – and let’s face it, I save time and money.

163
CHOOSING THE LIFE YOU DESIRE
When I was 13 years old, I remember seeing a commercial on television 
about a cassette tape called, “Where There’s a Will, There’s an A.” I 
used my life savings at the time to buy the tape. Just from hearing that 
simple commercial, for some reason I believed if I could make good 
grades, I could do anything and have anything in life. No one ever told 
me to get good grades or encouraged me educationally; I was just driven 
to get A’s. I was always stressed because I had to work so much and it 
took away from my time to study. 
Growing up in financial hardship was not easy by any means. It was 
difficult to see my friends at school wearing designer clothes and driving 
expensive cars when I had none of that. Yet my circumstances enabled 
me to be resourceful and something as simple as a phrase like, “Where 
there’s a will, there’s an A,” became motivational. I was able to extract 
from my meager surroundings and circumstances the resourcefulness 
and the motivation to become better than my past. 
Even though I could have fallen into the downward spiral of poverty, 
I chose to go in the opposite direction, using my circumstances as 
motivation to become better and to desire success. Even to this day, I 
believe where there is a will, there is not just an “A,” but there is a way! 
I have followed the way to financial freedom because of the choices I’ve 
made in my life and by refusing to allow my past to dictate my future. 
TRANSFORMING FROM SICKNESS TO HEALTH
I have had a number of physical problems throughout my life, but I 
refuse to allow those issues to stifle my personal growth or my physical 
activity. I’ve had three pre-cancer surgeries, surgery on both ankles and 
knees, broken ribs twice, a broken neck, I wasn’t able to have children, 
and I live with a condition called neurocardiogenic syncope (a brief loss 
of consciousness caused by a sudden drop in your heart rate and blood 
pressure, which reduces blood flow to your brain). While that’s quite a 
list, I choose to feel blessed in my health. I’m blessed to be cancer-free. 
I’m blessed to have nieces and nephews. 
You can dwell on the list of ailments, or you can focus on where you’re 
blessed. I could tell a lot of stories about my illnesses, surgeries and 
hospital stays, but I choose to talk about being cancer-free and my 
participation in various sports, like riding my bike and raising money 
for Multiple Sclerosis for more than 20 years. I take care of my body 

TRANSFORM
164
with proper nutrition and regular exercise; I have transformed from 
sickness to health and that’s the way I choose to live! 
TRANSFORMING FROM DYSFUNCTIONAL 
RELATIONSHIPS TO DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS
As I mentioned previously, to say that I grew up in a dysfunctional 
family is an understatement. No father, very little money, forbidden to 
talk with anyone about our problems, working since the age of 14 to 
support my family, and the list goes on and on. 
Add to this dysfunction, when I became old enough to date, well, let’s 
say I dated some real “toads.” I knew I needed to seek out relationships 
that were healthy, but how? 
As I progressed through college then into the workforce, I formed 
relationships with individuals who were successful. I had friends with 
designer clothes and expensive cars while in high school, but I never 
knew what success was supposed to look like or how it was to be 
achieved. 
As I worked hard, I was able to see what success looked like up close. 
Today I enjoy serving and working with chief executives and business 
leaders who want to go to the next level. I work with clients across 
the country, helping them develop strategic plans and influencing 
the growth potential of their companies. I facilitate professional 
development workshops training professionals on how to develop long-
term relationships, build their business and ultimately increase revenues 
across diverse industries. Additionally, I’ve started two successful 
businesses, I am a national keynote speaker, a best-selling author, an 
executive coach, a trainer, a consultant, and a chair and national speaker 
for Vistage International.
Today, I am part of a cohesive family that I have created with my husband 
and soul-mate. I am not poor. I treat people with dignity. I am making 
a difference in the lives of others. I went through a metamorphosis; a 
transformation. It was long and grueling. It took a lot of time and effort. 
But I made the transition. Has it always been easy? Not at all. I have 
had the rug pulled out from under me multiple times. But each time I 
have gotten back up and have stood strong, like the sunflowers grown 
in the Netherlands, the tallest in the world. Through hard work and right 

165
CHOOSING THE LIFE YOU DESIRE
choices, I have been able to leave behind the dysfunctional relationships 
and create dynamic relationships. 
No matter what your circumstances may be, I am confident you too can 
transform into the person you want to become. Don’t wait to enjoy life, 
make the most of every day. It’s your life; don’t ever give up. Make it 
the best one possible. If I can be successful, anyone can.

BE UNIQUE, MOTIVATED AND SUCCESSFUL
CHAPTER 18
BE UNIQUE, MOTIVATED  
AND SUCCESSFUL
BY JAMES BENNETT
I’m often asked how I’ve managed to create success in life while 
marching resolutely to the beat of a different drummer, and I invariably 
point out that any success I have flows directly from my commitment 
to being myself. Plenty of people extol the virtues of conforming to a 
program, plan, template or rulebook. I’m just not one of them. And while 
millions of people spend hours each week watching their favourite TV 
Reality shows, you’ll find me in the blissfully independent pursuit of 
my goals. The idea of watching someone else create their dream home, 
body, relationship or business has never made sense to me. We all get 
the same 24 hours: I spend mine designing and living a world that is 
uniquely my own.
In my view, Reality TV isn’t too far removed from Romans days when 
slaves, animals and Christians fought for their lives. Although the 
stakes were much higher then, the concept is similar: put on a show to 
funnel people’s attention where you want it to go. Today’s programs are 
dictated by vast commercial interests and I’m concerned that they affect 
everything from our workplace conversations to our cultural values. 
And, sadly, the images they present as “Normal” are usually anything 
but; do they celebrate the viewer’s strengths or subtly reinforce a sense 
of inadequacy? 

TRANSFORM
170
I’ve long been a fan of personal development expert Jim Rohn, who 
once said, “Make a plan for your life or risk being part of someone 
else’s.” As I tell my clients, no one else will care as much as you do 
about your results, so make sure that the life you create is one that you 
actually want to live.
I committed early to this path. My father died when I was four years 
old and my mother, quite naturally, felt completely unprepared for life 
as the widowed mother of three boys under the age of 10. Although 
she remarried, the marriage did not last, and it wasn’t long before we 
were living in poverty and worried about the future. As a teenager, I had 
my share of deprivation and my peer group wasn’t filled with people 
determined to create massive success in life. It’s easy to take on the belief 
systems of the people around us and we tend to become “the average” of 
the people with whom we surround ourselves. I was an independent kid 
who wasn’t content to take what life dished out, however. I wanted to 
play with possibilities that extended beyond the envelope of my world. 
And to do that, I had to get over my fear of living full out to the edge of 
my capability. It wasn’t easy. And it has been worth it!
Today I get enormous satisfaction out of helping entrepreneurs power 
forward in their own businesses as well. There is no place for fear in the 
running of a successful business—as former U.S. President Franklyn 
D. Roosevelt said, “We have nothing to fear but fear itself.” But we are 
often flooded with negative economic news, and even the most positive 
thinkers among us have no doubt struggled at times with doubts about 
the future. Which points to another reason for forging an independent 
path: it allows us to keep negative news and views at arm’s length, so 
we ourselves don’t become pessimistic. 
I believe it’s important to question the prevailing wisdom about most 
things. For example, do we need an Ivy League education in order to 
be successful? I think not! History is full of stories about people who 
built massively successful businesses with no university education at 
all—people like entrepreneur Richard Branson, Apple co-founder Steve 
Jobs, and Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy’s restaurants. And we all 
know about the successes of Walt Disney, Thomas Edison, Colonel 
Sanders and Albert Einstein. They may not have had a degree but they 
certainly were original thinkers! 

171
BE UNIQUE, MOTIVATED AND SUCCESSFUL
But how can entrepreneurs guarantee success?
As a business coach, I obviously favour the idea of hiring someone to 
help you generate better results. Coaching works. If you’re wary of the 
concept I invite you to look at it this way: many people will gladly hire 
a golf pro to improve their golf game, or a tennis instructor to improve 
their strokes. So why hesitate to hire a business mentor, especially when 
the implications of poor business results are significantly more serious 
than bad golf scores! 
So what else can you do to contribute to your own unique success? Here 
are a few ideas:
I. Embark upon a Relentless Search for Knowledge 
The Internet has revolutionized the way we do business and we now live 
in a world where we are competing with people around the world. And 
while our competition has increased, the size of our potential market 
has, too. Advancements in technology have connected us in ways we 
could never have imagined just a few decades ago. We need to learn 
how technology can help our businesses. And how it can hurt them. 
But technology isn’t the only topic entrepreneurs should be following. 
I firmly believe that you can never know too much about the world and 
the people with whom we share it. Learning keeps us sharp and one of 
my mottos is: “What If?”  We know that the average person uses only 
five per cent of their mental capacity. What if I could use even one per 
cent more?  Or better yet, what if I could learn one per cent more than 
what I currently know, or what if I could apply even one per cent more 
of what I know? Can you imagine the possibilities that line of thought 
might generate? What do I need to learn in order to make that happen?
II. Avoid the News
Although I am an avid reader, I generally stay away from the news, 
whether it’s coming at me from a newspaper, magazine, online platform 
or radio. News outlets are organized around negative information. If 
something bad happens, you’ll hear about it. If something good happens, 
it usually doesn’t make the cut. What that means is that we are exposed 
to a vision of reality that is skewed to disaster. Does that help us maintain 
a positive outlook or make sound decisions based on the whole picture? 
No! But it does provide us with a perfect scapegoat if things go wrong. 
How can we be expected to thrive if the economy is bad? Well, actually, 

TRANSFORM
172
some businesses do very well when the economy is doing perceptively 
poorly. Shouldn’t yours?
Anyone willing to adapt quickly and seek out opportunity can enjoy 
unlimited potential for growth and wealth, no matter what economic 
challenges seem to be presenting. You might have to work hard or 
change how you operate in order to make that concept bear fruit. But it’s 
possible. Information is valuable, of course, and I suggest to my clients 
that they find an online platform that presents a balanced synopsis of 
what they need to know.
III. Focus
How is it that such a small and simple word can represent such a challenge 
for so many people and businesses?  It really is a great question and one 
that a mentor of mine once qualified by saying “If you try to be all things 
to all people, you will end up being nothing to anyone.”  The most 
successful people in business are able to maintain a laser-like focus in 
everything they do.  You won’t find them wasting time with activities 
that don’t bring them closer to their goals, and they never perform low 
value-add tasks that they can delegate to others in their organizations.  
How do they maintain this focus?  Most successful people I know write 
down what they want to achieve, and review the list at least once a day 
to ensure they stay on task. If they determine that something has shifted, 
they modify their actions to stay on track. 
What you focus on tends to grow!
If your business is in its start-up phase, or you are redefining an existing 
business, you can improve your focus by zeroing in on who your ideal 
customer is. Is it a man or a woman? How old are they? Where do they 
live and what do they do for a living? Do they take public transit to 
work or do they drive a car? What kind of car? These criteria are all 
important because buying decisions are based in emotion and the more 
you know about your ideal customer, the better able you are to identify 
their emotional triggers. Miss this piece and you lose your chance to 
connect and, ultimately, to make a sale. 
Business owners at any stage of the success cycle can also increase their 
focus if they get into the habit of establishing weekly planning sessions 
to pinpoint all the activities that will bring them closer to their goals. 

173
BE UNIQUE, MOTIVATED AND SUCCESSFUL
If an action doesn’t bring you closer to your goals, you really need to 
question why you are doing it.  There are only so many hours in a day 
and you need to ensure you use them wisely.
IV. Commit to Excellence
What sets your business apart from other every other business around 
the world? That’s a key question, and for 99% of the business people 
I’ve coached, the answer lies in their commitment to excellence and the 
way they “Wow” their clients. 
So how do we reach this superior level of excellence?  There are a number 
of ways to do this and they all begin with you.  In order to function at 
your peak level of performance, it is important that you treat your body 
and mind like the superior, finely-tuned machine that it is.  You would 
never put regular gas into a high performance vehicle, would you? Your 
body needs the same consideration. It’s important to eat high quality, 
nutritious foods and exercise both your body and your mind regularly. 
Leaving out this piece will lead to low energy, slow response times and 
a lack of the kind of sparkle that attracts positive attention.
It’s also important to be active in personal development. The world’s 
best in any field invest more in their training and development than they 
do in actual execution. For example, a professional golfer will put their 
entire life on hold while they prepare for a pro tournament that lasts just 
a few days. They’ll engage a coach, sink thousands of practice putts and 
spend untold hours on the driving range. An Olympic sprinter will hire 
a coach, lift weights, extend their cardiovascular fitness, pay careful 
attention to their diet, and work on their mindset. All for a race that lasts 
less than 10 seconds. 
In most fields, successful people spend about 80% of their time training 
and 20% executing.   Success requires a lot of commitment. If it 
seems as though you are too busy to make time for more training and 
development, I invite you to consider this: most of us work at about 
50% of our capacity and many of us are not exactly efficient when it 
comes to using our time.  
Could you listen to an MP3 or a CD while you are commuting to work 
or while exercising? Could you wake up a half hour early every day to 
squeeze in time for a little reading? Over even just a few months you 
can leverage small amounts of time into big gains in knowledge and 

TRANSFORM
174
understanding if you are dedicated and consistent. Imagine the benefits 
over a decade! You could learn about best practices in your industry and 
develop your management and leadership skills. You could learn about, 
and implement, more advanced accounting and operational procedures. 
You could improve your marketing strategy. 
And you could figure out how to “WOW” your customers with 
exceptional customer service.  That’s a crucial aspect of ensuring that 
when people think about the kind of product or service you offer, your 
business is top of mind. If you are diligent, people will feel that your 
product is so valuable that the cost is almost irrelevant. You have no 
doubt heard the old adage that a disgruntled customer will tell 10 people 
what they think of you, while a happy customer might tell two. Your 
money is better spent retaining and serving happy customers than on 
damage control. 
Remember, too, that you are always marketing, and people will 
recognize you both inside and outside of your business; maintaining 
a lifestyle of integrity and authenticity is actually an important part 
of your marketing. The main focus of your business should be to get 
customers; your second objective is to have those customers become 
repeat customers. Do that well and the rest will take care of itself.
V. Be Original
Have you ever noticed how repetitious animal behavior is? Dogs greet 
each other the same way every time they meet, salmon spawn in the 
same river that their ancestors used, birds migrate to the same winter 
location every year. They can’t help it. It’s instinctive. Human beings, 
on the other hand, have the capacity to make choices and changes in 
our behavior. That gives us the potential to learn from our mistakes and 
make course corrections as required.  It also provides us the opportunity 
to fill our lives with possibility and surprise. 
But we can’t live full out to the edge of our business potential if we are 
following the crowd. Sure, there are some things that have been proven 
to work, and there is no advantage in reinventing the proverbial wheel. 
But there is a danger in mindlessly following the pack on every issue that 
comes along, and, in the process, stamping out the creative spark that 
makes us unique and fuels our individuality. Have you ever seen images 
of a Bald Eagle in flight? This beautiful, powerful, independent animal 

175
BE UNIQUE, MOTIVATED AND SUCCESSFUL
is majestic and predatory. It soars higher than the other birds, always in 
a class of its own. It is original, committed to results and focused—and 
it doesn’t get distracted by rumours of scarcity. It is fearless. I’ve spent 
no small amount of time watching eagles in flight and I believe it is that 
spirit of independence that can spur our imaginations forward to create 
more business success. 
So what’s stopping you from being unique? What’s preventing you from 
trusting your own judgement and stepping boldly into a world where 
your only limitation is your own willingness to be different? I think it’s 
time to change the paradigm of how we have traditionally done business 
in this world. You don’t serve anyone well by holding back the core 
part of you that makes you different and unique. And you can’t build a 
business if you don’t express the truth of who you are. Is marching to the 
beat of a different drummer a scary prospect at times? In the beginning, 
maybe so. But once you get in the habit of making independent choices, 
you’ll love the results. Just be committed. Be focused. And be unique.

CHAPTER 19
HUNGRY FOR CHANGE
BY BINETA NGOM
Man cannot discover new oceans unless he  
has the courage to lose sight of the shore.  
~ Andre Gide
When I look back at my childhood in Bargny, Senegal, I recall the desire 
I had to transform people’s lives, because mine was painful, lonely and 
fearful. My father passed away at the age of 34, leaving my mom with 
five children, I was four years old. My life was filled with pain, struggles 
and uncertainty. I was brilliant at school, but seeing my mother struggling 
made me stop going to school after some college to start working. My 
life was hard. My salary was not enough to support my family. Too many 
people around me were struggling. Too many children were in the street 
– orphans or just poor. I met a teenage girl who stopped school because 
of an untreated eye disease that led to blindness. I was devastated and 
sad, I wanted to be powerful enough to help all those people. I started 
dreaming of becoming someone who could alleviate the pain in women’s 
and children’s lives. Later on, after many years of confusion, my husband 
came to America and I was looking forward to coming and visiting.
After I got my visa to come to America, I realized that my dream would 
come true. My invitation to visit the USA could transform the lives of 
millions of women and children. I was excited, but at the same time, I 
was sad to leave my family.

TRANSFORM
178
My mom’s only words the day I was leaving were, “Surrender to GOD 
and everything will be fine.” 
I came to America and was a total stranger. I was alone with my husband 
only at my side. Not knowing what to do next was a little bit irritating. 
My dreams were big, but I was stuck. I tried to avoid stress, so instead, 
I was relaxing, reading books and magazines, and cooking. Watching 
the Oprah show was my favorite. She inspired me. I loved what she 
was doing and wanted to do the same immediately. She’s my hero as a 
woman who wants to help women.
I couldn’t enjoy anything. My loneliness took all the fun away. Instead 
of enjoying my visit, I was sad and very quiet, I was homesick and at 
the same time I was thinking about the kids living in the street and how 
to help them. It was painful.
Joy lies in the fight, in the attempt, in the suffering involved,  
not in the victory itself.  
~ Gandhi
Taking care of my family was my priority, that’s how we are raised in 
Senegal, family is first and the women’s job is to take care of the house, 
the men and the children. Now things are changing, women participate 
meaningfully in the economic development of the country. They are 
CEOs, business owners, and they are very much present in the work force. 
So while I was thinking about school, I found out that I was pregnant. It 
was hard, for the whole nine months. I was alone. I couldn’t go anywhere 
except for a doctor’s visit. Three months after that, I got news from 
my nurse practitioner. My baby could have a chromosomal abnormality 
such as Down syndrome. That was it for me. I couldn’t dream anymore, 
I was shut down completely. I never felt that much pain in my life up 
to that point. After they reviewed the size of the womb compared to the 
stage of the pregnancy, the baby was way too small. It was stressful. We 
were devastated. I physically changed completely, I was not sleeping 
well and my appetite was gone.
One morning, I woke up early and was meditating, and suddenly 
I thought about my mom’s words, “Always surrender to God.” I fell 
asleep and there was this vivid dream that was so clear that I thought 

179
HUNGRY FOR CHANGE
somebody was really talking to me. The only words I could remember 
after I woke up was: “Why are you worried?”
Still to me it was only a dream, but few days later, I started believing in 
that voice and I started shifting my thoughts. That was an ‘aha’ moment, 
I changed my paradigms completely. I became positive, my optimism 
grew and I was ready to accept the situation no matter what. I drew 
the conclusion that was GOD’s will, and I couldn’t do anything about 
it. However, I had faith and I was strong. I surrendered and I prepared 
myself. It was unbelievable to see how my life changed by just changing 
my thoughts. The pain was replaced by excitement, suddenly I became 
happier.
They sent me to a local hospital to do an amniocentesis. At that moment, 
I didn’t want to know anymore. I was just ready to move on and get ready 
to welcome my first daughter to the world, the pain was too much to 
deal with. I asked the doctor before signing any papers if this procedure 
would help my baby in any way. He said no. This was just to learn more 
about the situation, but it wouldn’t do anything that could make it better. 
They just wanted to know if there was a disorder or any other problems.
I declined the test. Knowing about a problem and not being able to do 
something about it is another problem. I respectfully left the office with 
a smile. I was proud of myself, after I changed the way I looked at the 
situation, everything changed. I start visualizing a healthy baby, I was 
very excited again. 
Three months after that we went to another appointment. As soon as the 
nurse entered the room, she started apologizing and said many things 
that I didn’t even remember. The only words I could recall after her 
long conversation with my husband was that there was a mistake and I 
jumped out of the chair and start asking questions. She explained that 
they thought I gave them some wrong information. To make a long story 
short, I made a mistake on the date of my last menstrual cycle.
We were very happy to hear that. I was very relieved but still skeptical, 
I just couldn’t wait any more for this pregnancy to end. It was hard, 
painful and long.
On my due date, things went fast and the baby came out very easily. After 
I heard her crying, with my eyes closed, I asked my husband about her 

TRANSFORM
180
condition with a face full of tears, fear and at the same time excitement. 
She was fine, healthy and beautiful. I then became emotional, it was 
like GOD was with me the whole time. I was thankful and grateful 
again. I was feeling the power of GOD in my whole body. The vibration 
was intense and I couldn’t stop praising GOD again and again. It was a 
true blessing and a happy ending. This experience gave me more faith 
and made me stronger. Things happen for a reason and when they do, 
the only answer would be God. Take your mind off the problem and 
visualize the result you wanted. Take your experiences as your teachers.
Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.  
~Winston Churchill
I refused to give up, I expected things to turn around and I had a strong 
belief that it would. I set my mind to victory knowing that I was in the 
biggest country in the world. I don’t have a product to sell, but I can 
raise awareness through this book to transform the life of millions of 
women and children.
We can alleviate the pain in the lives of homeless women and children 
by building more affordable housing, creating more employment 
opportunities and by developing more programs for abuse, addiction, 
lack of skills and many more – to help women and children.
According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
1 out of 50 children or 1.5 million children in America will be homeless 
each year.
 Most homeless families consist of a single mother and children. The 
number of homeless children reached a very high percentage in 2011-12 
compared to 1983.
THE MIND BLOCKS…
 Get rid of negative beliefs, they stop you from growing. Minimize 
stereotyping as much as possible. Just help. So many people miss the 
opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives because of some false 
beliefs. How did that happen and why it happened is not the answer, the 
solution is to touch people’s souls if you can – because there is nothing 
in life like an opportunity.

181
HUNGRY FOR CHANGE
Stop stereotyping and be positive.
Set your mind at a higher level, keep it there and change your outlook. 
Change the way you look at things. When I ask people to help women 
in the street, most of the answers I got were that they have addictions, 
and no matter what you do, they still will feed their addictions and they 
don’t even want to get help.
Why not do something to help them get out of the situation instead of 
blaming them? Why not give them a chance?
America is the country of hope and almost everybody in the world wants 
to come to visit this wonderful land. Being here means a lot to me, and 
I don’t want to miss any opportunity that could open up doors for other 
women to get a better life.
After I had my fourth child, I became a housewife again, but this time it 
was different. I made a determined decision to do something that could 
make me happy. I would get up early in the morning and take my baby 
with me to the book store. I would spend three to four hours reading and 
searching. I knew at that moment that it was up to me to be successful and 
help people, I suffered too much in my life already; I have a mind and I 
want to use it wisely. 
You can’t suffer all of your life. You have to stop, think about your self-
worth and take control of your life.
When I went to the book store, before reading or buying anything, I sat 
down and asked myself these questions: 
•	 Who am I and why am I here?
•	 What makes me happy?
•	 What can I do to help women and children?
•	 How can I make a change?
My mind was working hard on those questions, I was visualizing many 
good things and at the same time I was thinking about mind blocks.  
I got up and started walking around the aisle of the leadership section. 
From that day on, the bookstore became my favorite place. Reading 
book after book increased my knowledge. I couldn’t stop reading, it 
became my hobby.

TRANSFORM
182
From book to book, I learned some of the laws of the universe and 
knew that I’m the one and only person blocking my success by being 
negative, irresponsible in my actions and most importantly, not being 
clear about what I really want.
After a while, I started visualizing women’s centers and safe places for 
children all over the world. I wanted to see that happening so badly that 
I created a non-profit organization. 
THE FAMILY BRIDGE FOUNDATION
I’m looking for opportunities to help women overcome all kinds of 
addiction, help them take control of their life here, in Africa and the rest 
of the world. When women are happy, the world becomes a better place 
for everyone. 
Calls to action:
•	 I call on everyone to make a difference in their community by 
donating.
•	 Be a mentor in your community.
•	 Donate money to organizations that help.
•	 Donate a building for shelter.
•	 Donate food or organize a food drive.
•	 Donate clothes, shoes, toys or school supplies.
•	 And most importantly, V-O-L-U-N-T-E-E-R and give back to 
America.
•	 Educate your children about the homeless, poverty and hunger 
and let them get involved in the cause of their choice. Teach 
them to appreciate and not to take what they have for granted. 
Making a difference starts with your family first.
This book is an opportunity for me to encourage everyone to fight for a 
better world and to raise awareness. Let’s come together to find ways to 
give back and to transform the life of those in need.
GOD BLESS!!!

About Bineta
Bineta Ngom was born in 1964 in a small town called Bargny 
in Senegal, West Africa, and grew up without her father. She 
was raised by one of the strongest women on earth and a most 
giving woman – no matter how tough life was, her mom would 
always help others. Growing up was a struggle that molded her 
into a very strong person. She used to see women in her town living the life of hard 
knocks and she couldn’t do  much about it. She used to stay in her room alone for 
hours as a teenager just thinking of ways to help those mothers. 
She came to America in 1994 to join her husband and she noticed opportunities all 
over the place. She feels really blessed to be here. She can see clearly now how 
much she can learn in America to change people’s way of living. Her hobbies are 
reading and cooking. She likes to read books that improve her personal development, 
and in her spare time she likes to be creative in her kitchen. She is also blessed with 
four beautiful children who are growing up knowing that part of life is about serving 
others. She is proud of them.
No matter what type of work Bineta does, she doesn’t feel happiness or any 
enthusiasm unless she’s helping others, volunteering or working towards improving 
their situation – knowing that one day she will be able to reach out to many 
struggling families. From her teenage years, she knew who she wanted to be. She 
knew her passion was to have a career that involved helping others. Coming from 
a totally different world, she was lost during her first years in America. She was at 
the stumbling stage for a long time. It took quite a lot of time to figure out what to 
do to help people.
Bineta established the Family Bridge Foundation – a non-profit organization whose 
purpose is to help women and children’s lives in any way possible. Her real journey 
starts with this opportunity to serve.

MASTERING THE “FORMULA FOR LIFETIME WEALTH” 
CHAPTER 20
MASTERING THE  
“FORMULA FOR  
LIFETIME WEALTH” 
BY GARY CURRY
Have you ever asked yourself the question, “If America is so rich, why 
does everyone always seem so broke?”
Almost everyone wants to accumulate enough money to do the things in 
life that makes them happy. Despite this almost universal desire, many 
individuals are never able to reach this goal. 
Ask yourself this question: What does enough money mean to me? In 
other words, how do I know if I will have the money to do what I want?
Does Enough Money® mean you can buy that fancy new car? Or that 
you can have money to buy and pay for your dream house? Does it 
mean one million dollars? Ten million dollars?
I don’t know what your definition is, but my definition of Enough 
Money® is “when work is optional and retirement and leisure activities 
are affordable.”
Most people agree with this definition. Do you?
I like it because it is very personal. What may be Enough Money® for 
you may differ considerably from what may be Enough Money® for 
someone else. 

TRANSFORM
186
If we can agree on this definition, then the next question is, “Why don’t 
people accumulate and enjoy Enough Money®?”
Could it be because they don’t know the “Formula for Lifetime Wealth”?
If that is true, then the first step is to learn the Formula for Lifetime 
Wealth.
The “Formula for Lifetime Wealth” is:
•	 Regular Deposits 
•	 Plus Diversification 
•	 Plus Time
•	 Plus Compound Interest 
•	 Minus the effects of Inflation and Taxes 
•	 Equals Enough Money® and remember “when work is optional 
and retirement and leisure activities are affordable.”
The Formula for Lifetime Wealth is simple and effective. It is a Formula 
that should be taught to all high school students. Unfortunately, it is a 
Formula that few Americans will ever learn and use.
To get you started on your way, let me explain how the five components 
of the Formula for Lifetime Wealth work. If you don’t understand how 
the Formula elements can work FOR you—you may discover how the 
Formula can work AGAINST you. 
REGULAR DEPOSITS
Many people often ask themselves, “Where does all of my money go?” 
It sometimes is something of a mystery, isn’t it?
The first step in answering this question involves looking at your 
paycheck. What’s the first thing you pay out of your paycheck? Taxes, 
which include Federal Income Withholding, Social Security, Medicare, 
state and local deductions. 
After you contribute to the public good, you then pay for the necessities 
of life: food, clothing, housing, medical care and transportation. After 
you pay for the necessities, you use what’s left to create your own 
lifestyle. 

187
MASTERING THE “FORMULA FOR LIFETIME WEALTH” 
However, many of us tend to live beyond our means—much to our 
detriment—through the use of credit cards. 
So, now what? After paying to keep our lights on, our families fed and 
bring a little fun and entertainment into our lives, we then save for the 
future. While this is a common practice, is it really wise or is it the best 
way to generate and grow wealth?
There is a right way to begin to accumulate Enough Money® and it 
involves paying yourself first. A portion of all of your earnings should 
be yours to keep. We should be paying ourselves first on a regular basis.
Yes, pay yourself first, ahead of your necessities, and especially ahead 
of your credit cards, and you will eventually be able to enjoy a stress-
free lifestyle.
What is the amount we should be paying ourselves first? I believe you 
should consider saving at least 10 percent of your earnings. 
Take a minute before you read on, and calculate how much you are 
paying yourself first.
DIVERSIFICATION
One of the most important rules of investing and money management 
is to diversify your assets. This will strengthen your protection against 
risk. It’s important to remember that all asset categories –from Treasury 
bonds to mortgage-backed securities—all come with some inherent 
risk. The optimum balance for your assets will vary according to such 
factors as your time horizon and your tolerance for risk. 
You, like most other people, have three asset categories available, which 
include: 
1. Social Security or other government retirement plans; 
2. Qualified plans, which may include Individual Retirement 
Accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 457s, Thrift Savings Plans (TSPs) or 
pensions; and 
3. Personal Savings and Investments which may include cash, 
stocks, bonds, real estate, businesses or other revenue generating 
assets. 

TRANSFORM
188
There are many differences among the three types of asset categories. 
Therefore, it is important to coordinate these three asset categories in 
order to make sound decisions regarding your strategy to accumulate 
and enjoy Enough Money®.
Further, it is advisable to research and implement the best Diversification 
strategy within the tax qualified plans and personal savings and 
investments categories.
It is of the utmost importance to understand how the various tax-qualified 
plans work and which saving and investment options you need to utilize 
to maximize the growth of your assets. 
The total value of your assets, minus your debt equals your net worth. And 
I believe it is your net worth, not your income, that defines your wealth.
Although diversification and asset allocation cannot guarantee a profit 
or protect against loss in declining markets, diversifying among and 
inside the three asset categories—government retirement plans, tax 
qualified plans, and personal savings and investments—will help you 
guard against risk, and possibly accelerate the growth of your net worth.
Have you coordinated your three valuable asset categories?
TIME
As the saying goes, “time is money.” If you understand the time value of 
money, then you know that Time is an investor’s best friend. 
Everyone wants to maximize the time they have, but almost everyone is 
guilty of procrastination.
You’ve probably heard more than a few people say, “After I pay for my 
big screen TV, new furniture, next vacation or whatever, that’s when I’m 
going to start saving money.”
Have you ever put off paying yourself first?
I will now illustrate the cost to putting off paying yourself first. 
To do that, I want to tell you a story about a man named Larry Later. 
Larry is a planner and he plans on accumulating $250,000 by the age 
of 65.

189
MASTERING THE “FORMULA FOR LIFETIME WEALTH” 
Larry told himself, “If I can earn a 8 percent rate of return on my money 
and if I start when I’m age 30, all I have to do is save about $112 per 
month to have $250,000.”
“This is simple,” Larry said, feeling proud of himself.
But, do you remember Larry’s last name? Later. As you may have 
guessed, Larry doesn’t start paying himself first the day that he turns 30. 
Instead, he waits and allows time to go by. How much time? A decade.
He is now 40 years old, but still wants $250,000 at age 65. He calculates 
that if he can earn a 8 percent rate of return, he will need to save about 
$264 per month.
“I can handle this,” Larry says to himself, a bit nervous, but still 
confident. “It may be tight but I can do this.”
Again, what’s Larry’s last name? That’s right, Later. Larry waits one last 
time until he is age 50. Now, at 8 percent rate of return, he has to save a 
whopping $711 per month to do what $112 per month would have done 
if he had just taken advantage of time.
Of course, this and my other hypothetical illustrations do not represent 
any specific investment, nor do they take into account that it is unlikely 
that any one rate of return will be sustained over time. All investments 
involve risk and you may have a profit or a loss and remember seeking 
higher rates of return involves higher risks. The scenario also doesn’t 
take into consideration taxes, fees or charges associated with investing. 
But the lesson still stands. 
Time is money. And as the infomercials state, “So act now!”
COMPOUND INTEREST
You may have learned about Compound Interest during a boring grade 
school math class, but I’d like to illustrate the power of this concept by 
explaining the “1% Difference.”
Children and grandchildren are the most precious gifts in our lives. So 
let’s assume you wanted to make a one-time $10,000 gift to your newly 
born grandchild. 
Your goal is to let the $10,000 compound until your grandchild is age 

TRANSFORM
190
65. At the same time you wonder if you should pursue a 7 percent rate of 
return or an 8 percent rate of return. Would a 1% rate of return increase 
really make a big difference? Let’s see.
If your grandchild earns a 7 percent rate of return on the $10,000 single 
investment compounded annually until age 65, he or she will have 
$812,728.61. Wouldn’t that be great?
However, if your grandchild earns 8 percent compounded annually on 
the same $10,000, at age 65 he or she will have $1,487,798.47. WOW! 
That’s $675,000 more! 
The “1 Percent Difference” compounded annually for 65 years almost 
doubles the return.
How can that be? The amazing power of Time plus Compounding 
Interest is the answer. Compounding interest is truly an astonishing 
power!
It is vitally important to understand and use the power of Compound 
Interest. Wouldn’t you agree? 
EFFECTS OF INFLATION
We have all read and heard about how inflation has eroded our purchasing 
power, but would you believe that thanks to inflation, a stamp that costs 
six cents in 1972, costs 49 cents in 2014? Think about the gas that you 
have to put in your car every week. The gallon of fuel that averaged 63 
cents in 1978 now hovers between $3.50 and $4.00. 
Housing prices have probably been affected the most by inflation. In 
1978, in some areas a person could move into a high-quality home for 
$54,800. Today, the idea is almost laughable. Buyers today can expect 
to spend around $300,000 for the same high-quality home.
Who would have predicted these price jumps if we had asked them back 
then?
No one can accurately predict the future, and there are no foolproof 
methods for protecting against inflation. It is important, however, that 
when you do your planning, you should consider the impact of inflation. 
Are you?

EFFECTS OF TAXES
Taxes are a fact of life that you can’t avoid. Everyone has to pay taxes—
sales, property, income, and estate taxes—just to name a few. The good 
news is there are certain strategies that will let you choose when to pay 
your taxes and help you possibly reduce your tax liability.
The landmark Supreme Court ruling in the case of Gregory v. Helvering 
states, “The legal right of the taxpayer to decrease the amount of what 
would otherwise be his taxes, or altogether avoid them by means which 
the law permits, cannot be doubted.”
An example of this legal reduction in tax liability is the mortgage interest 
deduction on your primary residence or the tax deductible gift to your 
favorite charity. 
This isn’t just good news, it’s great news. The only problem is that the 
government, not surprisingly, does not provide us with an easy-to-use 
reference guide. 
It is up to you to learn about things such as mortgage interest deductions, 
IRAs, Roth IRAs, College Education 529 Plans, Charitable Gifts, Non-
modified endowment life insurance contracts and other tax-advantaged 
concepts. 
Here’s another question for you: “Are you required to make use any of 
these tax-advantaged concepts?” The answer is, of course, “no.”
However, I’m sure you would agree that it is very important that your 
money enjoys the maximum tax protection allowed by law. 
Have you checked to see if you are using the tax advantage concepts 
that will benefit you?
ENOUGH MONEY®
Have you thought about your finances lately? Really thought about 
them? Are they a mess?
If so, you may want to implement the “Formula for Lifetime Wealth” 
– which is: Regular Deposits, plus Diversification, plus Time, plus 
Compound Interest, minus the effects of Inflation and Taxes equals 
Enough Money®. 

TRANSFORM
192
Remember, my concept of Enough Money® is defined as “when work is 
optional and retirement and leisure activities are affordable.”
To reach this worthy goal, you must move beyond wishing.
Start implementing the first step of the “Formula for Lifetime Wealth 
today. And then implement each successive step.
When you do, you will transform your financial life.

ACHIEVING FINANCIAL SUCCESS THROUGH GREAT FINANCIAL PLANNING
CHAPTER 21
ACHIEVING FINANCIAL  
SUCCESS THROUGH GREAT 
FINANCIAL PLANNING
BY LIM CHER HONG, ChFC®
In every aspect of life, have a game plan,  
and then do your best to achieve it.  
~ Alan Kulwicki
I’m deeply honoured to be invited to co-write a book with Brian Tracy. 
In this chapter, I will be showing you the secret to achieving financial 
success through a great financial plan for yourself. I will be highlighting 
the essence of creating a great financial plan. If you require the full 
details and framework for creating a great financial plan, please get a 
copy of my new book Framework for Creating a Great Financial Plan.
Many of my clients whom I have helped to create a financial plan, 
appreciated the effort that I put in for them to understand their current 
financial situation and implement solutions to meet their shortfall. Over 
the years, many of them saved tens of thousands of dollars by simply 
implementing the recommended solution. I even have clients who 
were bankrupt and eventually became debt-free and are now leading a 
comfortable lifestyle… and clients who aspired to be millionaires but 
didn’t realise how easy it was to be one. 
Don’t get me wrong, this chapter is not about how to get rich fast, 
but merely to show you the way to create a basic financial plan for 
yourself. You are strongly advised to seek help from a professional such as 

TRANSFORM
196
a chartered financial consultant for a more comprehensive financial plan. 
Again my new book on “Framework for creating a great financial plan” 
will be able to give you a more holistic way to create a great financial plan.
The problem with today’s world is not about not having information 
on how to achieve financial success, but on the contrary, we have too 
much information. For example, we can google from Internet for the 
result that we want or we can find a self-help book. Ironically, all of 
these created another obstacle for us to fully understand which is the 
best way of doing things. Sadly, there aren’t any books out there that 
teach you how to create a financial plan for yourself. The mystery will 
be uncovered as you read along.
I personally have written a financial plan for myself. The greatest 
satisfaction that I get from my financial plan is a big overview of my 
financial situation – which allows me to make changes and implement 
solutions to cover my shortfall. Whenever my financial situation 
changes, I am able to better manage my finances to achieve overall 
financial success. 
I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. When I was young, I used 
to stay in a small one-room rented flat with my mother and sister. My 
mum had to work long hours to support the family. Life was very tough 
for her, so I made a decision to study hard and hopefully get a well-paid 
job when I grew up so that I could give her a better life. I decided to go 
into the banking and insurance industry to provide wealth management 
advice as I fully appreciate and understand the importance of financial 
planning. When I was working in the bank and insurance company, I 
realised that I was merely selling what the company wants us to sell, 
even though they kept emphasizing to sell based on customer needs. 
There was something missing, so I decided to pursue a professional 
qualification and gained myself a Chartered Financial Consultant title. 
Now, you do not have to be like me to pursue a professional qualification 
to be able to create a great financial plan. You can do it yourself as well. 
All you have to do is to follow through my framework in this chapter to 
create a plan for yourself.
It’s a myth to think that personal financial planning is only for the 
wealthy. Everyone needs to plan for their finances. Even if you are 
heavily in debt, this chapter will guide you how to get out of your debt 

197
ACHIEVING FINANCIAL SUCCESS THROUGH GREAT FINANCIAL PLANNING
burden. If you are rich, I will be able to guide you on protecting your 
wealth and grow it further. As I mentioned earlier, I have personally 
used some of these strategies for myself and achieved great financial 
success. You too can achieve this financial success.
Now this is what you have been waiting for. The framework for creating 
a great financial plan to achieve financial success emphasises four key 
steps. 
THE FOUR STEPS FRAMEWORK
1) Preliminary assessment of your financial needs and goals
2) Developing a Financial Plan
THE EIGHT KEY AREAS
	
i) Money Management
	
ii) Credit Management
	
iii) Risk Management & Insurance Planning
	
iv) Education Planning
	
v) Retirement Planning
	
vi) Investment Planning
	
vii) Tax Planning
	
viii) Estate Planning
3) Implementation
4) Monitoring and reviewing 
The most difficult part of financial planning is when you start to construct 
the plan. If you are serious about planning, go and get a pen and paper 
now to start constructing. Or simply get a laptop or even a smart phone 
and start typing. In the next paragraph, I will be going through details 
on the framework. This is where the work began. 
Remember you need to take action in order to achieve financial success. 
By not taking any action, you are certainly not going to change your 
financial situation. I hope this chapter serves you and helps you achieve 
great financial success through creating a great financial plan for yourself.

TRANSFORM
198
STEP 1 - PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF  
YOUR FINANCIAL NEEDS AND GOALS
First, you need to understand your own risk tolerance. Are you a risk-
adverse or a risk-seeking person? A risk-adverse person is simply 
someone who avoids risks and does not mind lower returns to preserve 
capital. A risk-seeker is someone who is willing to take a higher risk 
for the potential for capital growth and does not need the capital for the 
long term. They are prepared to invest a bigger amount during a market 
downturn.
After conducting your preliminary assessment, you need to identify your 
financial goals and concerns for your family, yourself, your business 
and any other concerns which you may have. Make sure your goals 
and concerns are specific, measurable, achievable and time-framed. It 
should be quantified in today’s dollar. Rank your financial goals and 
concerns in terms of importance and wants or according to short term, 
medium term or long term.
STEP 2 - DEVELOPING A FINANCIAL PLAN
During the whole planning process you will be making some personal 
and economic assumptions to facilitate your calculations. Note that 
any changes made to the assumptions may have drastic results. You are 
strongly advised to compare the results when you are making changes 
to the assumptions. 
For money management, we will be looking at a cash flow and net 
worth statement. The objectives of creating a cash flow and net worth 
statement is to understand your current cash flow and your current net 
worth. It will give you an overview of your current financial situation.
To create a cash flow statement, you simply list all your cash inflow and 
subtract all your fixed and variable cash outflow on an annual basis. If 
the outcome of the net cash flow is surplus/positive, it means you have 
excess cash for your planning. However, if you have a deficit/negative 
net cash flow, it does not necessary means you are doomed. What is 
important is you must understand what are the contributing factors for 
the deficit. Be aware of the weaknesses and strengths of the current cash 
position. Do your own budgeting on each of the items.

199
ACHIEVING FINANCIAL SUCCESS THROUGH GREAT FINANCIAL PLANNING
To create a net worth statement, you simply list all your cash/near cash, 
investment assets and personal use assets less all of your current and 
long term liabilities to get the net worth. If the outcome is positive, it 
simply mean if you liquidate all your assets, it will be able to cover 
all your liabilities. If the outcome is negative, you should be worried. 
You need to work extra hard to generate more assets and pay off your 
liabilities, as much as possible in the shortest period of time. Find out 
whether you require insurance protection for your assets and liabilities. 
Also find out whether you need to diversify your investment. All these 
will be covered in greater detail in the next few paragraphs.
For credit management, list all your debts and liabilities in order of the 
highest to the lowest rate of interest. Find out whether there are any 
ways to reduce the interest or start paying off loans with the highest 
interest first. Are you able to refinance the loan with another institution 
or use another type of loan for the same purpose? Take into consideration 
whether you have any large upcoming expenditures such as buying a new 
house. You can also consider credit protection or mortgage-reducing 
term insurance to fulfil this need. 
For Risk Management as a business owner, you need to analyse your 
business risk. Are there any better forms of business setup? Ensure 
you have a business succession plan, credit protection, and “golden 
handcuffs” to retain your key employee(s) where applicable. 
For Insurance Planning, you need to provide adequate funds for 
living needs of love ones in the events of premature death, partial or 
total permanent disabilities, critical illness, hospitalisation (medical 
expenses) and long term care. Ensure you have sufficient funding 
for your children’s education and pay off outstanding debts, taxes, 
etc. (whichever applies). Consider using term or whole life insurance 
for premature death, partial and total permanent disabilities. Use an 
appropriate standalone insurance plan for critical illness, hospitalisation 
and long term care. It can be a rider attached to the term or whole life 
plan as well. 
For Education Planning, you need to know the current cost of education 
and how much would it cost in future when you need the funding. Taking 
into account tuition fee and living expenses. Consider using investment 
or insurance endowment plan to fulfil this need.

TRANSFORM
200
For Retirement Planning, you decide your own retirement goals such 
as desired life-style and retirement income. You can either use the 
replacement ratio or expense ratio method to calculate your retirement 
requirements.
Assuming replacement ratio method, the following are the calculation 
steps:
1) Your current annual income (pv)
2) Years to retirement (n)
3) Salary growth (i)
4) Desired 1st year income at retirement (fv, PMT) 
5) Number of years to provide (N)
6) Inflation-adjusted investment return (I)
7) Lump sum required (PV)
Consider using an annuity plan or investment plan or any other retirement 
insurance vehicle to fund this need. 
For Investment Planning, you need to know your current financial 
situation. What are your financial goals and objectives for investment? 
What is your risk profile and investment horizon? What is your desired 
rate of return and whether it is achievable? You need to have a good 
understanding of investment. If you are new to investment, you are 
strongly encouraged to engage a professional banker to provide you with 
the necessary advice. Ensure you have sufficient emergency funding 
before investing. What are the costs and risks in the investment? Avoid 
investing solely in any investment asset. 
For Tax Planning, your objectives are minimising tax payable and 
maximising any deductions and/or reliefs. Check with your jurisdiction 
as to whether you are able to enjoy any tax exemption (for example, if 
you are self-employed, married with kids, etc.). Does your government 
offer any form of supplementary retirement scheme to enjoy deferment 
of income tax. You need to understand the advantages and disadvantages 
of doing so.
For Estate Planning, your objective is to find out the provision of liquidity 
for your personal and dependents financial needs should anything 
unfortunate happens during your lifetime and for your dependents upon 

201
ACHIEVING FINANCIAL SUCCESS THROUGH GREAT FINANCIAL PLANNING
your death. Estate consists of everything a person owned, or jointly 
owned with someone else, which includes both assets and liabilities. 
Go write a Will if you have not done so. Make a nomination for any 
government provident funds. Ensure all your insurance policies 
beneficiaries are in line with your Will. Find out whether there is any 
estate duty payable for overseas assets. If so, plan for ways to fund it. 
You can also consider setting up a trust. If you have children, arrange 
guardianship. In the event of incapacitation, you may want to consider 
setting up a power of attorney. 
STEP 3 - IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation is by far the most important part of the whole financial 
plan. Imagine you have the greatest plan in the world but you choose to 
sit on it and do nothing about it. Nothing will change and your life will 
still be the same. 
This is where you need to consult a professional like a Chartered 
Financial Consultant to help you evaluate your wealth plan, a lawyer 
to help draft or vet your Will, a tax officer to further check on any other 
claimable amount or deductible, a regular doctor who has your medical 
history, a banker to advise you on investment or loans, etc. Do keep 
their contacts in your phone book or mobile phone for easy reach. 
After seeking the advice from all the professional, it is important that you 
make your own decision whether to take their advice or seek a second 
opinion. Before you take any action, make sure you are fully aware of 
the features and benefits of the products. What are the risks inherent in 
the products? As well as the commitment period and whether it is by 
far the best when compared to other similar products. Best does not 
necessary mean the cheapest. More importantly is whether the product 
will meet your financial goals and objectives.
STEP 4 - MONITORING
Do not assume that all your plans will definite meet your financial goal. 
It is important to schedule time for reviewing. Recommended time 
frame is every three months. If you are reviewing with your advisor or 
banker, do evaluate your options properly before committing. Ironically, 
sometime doing nothing may be the best solution. Just make sure you 
are on track with what you have already planned.

TRANSFORM
202
You should also review your financial plan whenever there are changes 
in your financial situation. Example, you may be getting married or 
planning to have a child, etc. You have to decide what sort of changes 
need to be made to your plan. Consider whether you need to get another 
product or liquidate any investment. 
CONCLUSION
Now that you know the way to achieve financial success through a great 
financial plan, I really hope you have already created one for yourself 
and started working on your shortfall to achieve your desired financial 
success.
If you want to create a more comprehensive financial plan, please get a 
copy of my new book Framework for Creating a Great Financial Plan.
I hope my chapter on achieving financial success through a great 
financial plan has served you and may your life be transformed with 
great financial success.

RAISE YOUR SALES: RAISED AWARENESS INCREASES SALES EXECUTION
CHAPTER 22
RAISE YOUR SALES:  
RAISED AWARENESS  
INCREASES SALES  
EXECUTION
BY KIRK MANZO
In the summer of 1982, I worked for the Southwestern Co. headquartered 
in Franklin, Tennessee. (Yes, I realize some readers weren’t even born 
yet. Humor me— I’m the old guy). Southwestern had a simple, but 
effective sales formula.
If you lived in the south, you went to sell in the north, and vice versa. It 
sure pushed you out of your comfort zone. For a college kid who grew up 
in Hollywood, Florida, selling books door-to-door in Rockford, Illinois, 
felt like another world. Even ordering a Coke (known as a “soda’ to 
me) required a different language, “I’ll have a ‘Pop,’ please, with my 
burger.” It also made you think twice about driving home back to South 
Florida after a tough sales day. 
Our target customer was well-defined—families with children in school. 
Sure, we could knock on EVERYBODY’S door, but there are only so 
many selling hours in a day (13.5 to be exact—8a.m.-9:30p.m.), and we 
wanted to present our products to qualified people. 
Going door-to-door was quite the adventure. You never really knew 
what to expect. Some folks were great. They would be polite, let you in 

TRANSFORM
206
and even offer to make you a peanut butter sandwich for lunch, if you 
asked. Others—well, let’s just say they made you appreciate the nice 
ones. 
One such person was obviously having a bad day. After she proceeded 
to slam the door in my face and hurl profanities instructing me to get off 
her porch, I thought, Why not try one of the strategies they taught us in 
training class?
I ran around to the back of the house and knocked on the kitchen 
door. When the woman answered the door, she looked at me with a 
stunned expression. Using my same friendly introduction, I explained 
about being the college kid from Florida talking to families about the 
importance of education. I then remarked that I simply wanted to verify 
if perhaps the person who lived in the BACK of the house was in a 
better mood than the one who answered the front door!
While this strategy did not always work to make a sale, it sure helped 
me keep a good attitude when dealing with difficult people.
My presentation of the Webster’s Student Handbooks would focus 
primarily on the subjects that were most difficult for their children in 
school. These were identified during the rapport-building and interview 
questions with the family. Understanding the specific needs made it 
much easier to provide a relevant solution.
The beauty was that the two-volume set covered all the key areas. Unlike 
a full set of reference books (encyclopedias—yes, those did exist before 
the internet—like libraries), our books were more cost-effective, easier 
to use, and saved time.
The end of each sale was well-designed and orchestrated. The sale was 
finalized when the customer filled out the order pad and verified the 
address where they would like their notification mailed, prior to delivery 
at the end of the summer. A great percentage of people whom objected 
on price could be convinced through the comparison of the cost of 
education versus the cost of NOT having one. Thus the importance of 
knowing, “Who is your ideal customer?” BEFORE launching your sales 
campaign.

207
RAISE YOUR SALES: RAISED AWARENESS INCREASES SALES EXECUTION
1 - RECOGNIZE YOUR IDEAL CLIENT AND  
REDUCE SALES RESISTANCE
Pareto’s Principle is hard to ignore, since it applies to both the use of your 
time and to the type of customers you will encounter when offering your 
goods and services. For those who may have forgotten about Signore 
Pareto, he was an Italian mathematician and economist who identified 
the “80/20 Rule.”
According to Pareto’s Principle, 80 percent of your return comes from 
20 percent of your efforts, and yes, therefore, 20 percent of your sales 
team and clients will produce 80 percent of your sales! Accepting this 
reality allows you to allocate your time and resources to solicit and 
attract your “Ideal Client.” 
Remember that, birds of a feather do indeed flock together. Identify 
your top accounts or clients, and then separate them by industry, size, or 
geography so you can target your audience more effectively. After all, 
there are a limited number of hours in a day. The problem you helped 
solve for your top client is not typically UNIQUE to that one company. 
If your product or service helped ABC Company, then why wouldn’t it 
help others just like them?
Become the expert in your niche. When working as an Account Manager 
for U.S. Surgical, we were required to read medical journals and 
memorize sections of articles to increase our credibility with surgeons 
and hospital staff. It was one of the reasons that U.S. Surgical dominated 
the Florida market in the early ‘90s. At one point, they controlled a 90 
percent market share of the surgical instruments they offered.
2- ADAPT TO YOUR PROSPECT AND  
ACQUIRE A CONNECTION
People buy from people they Like and Trust. So, how can you help 
yourself in this area? A couple of years ago, my wife, Sharon, and I 
decided to head up to Northwest Georgia on a Saturday morning in 
December to check out a community called Big Canoe. They were 
offering tours of a Christmas-themed showcase home and access to their 
private clubhouse and facilities. By the way, this is a classic application 
of the “Law of Reciprocity,” which timeshares have used as an effective 
strategy for years. Why? Because it works! Provide something of value 

TRANSFORM
208
at no charge and the recipient feels obligated to return something in 
kind, like their willingness to hear about your products or services.
After touring a magnificent home and enjoying a terrific lunch in the 
clubhouse, our sales guide Marty offered to show us some of the new 
homes and lots available for sale. Before doing this, he very casually 
pulled out his Evidence Manual (a visual sales tool to build rapport with 
customers) to show us his home and family, including his grandkids 
visiting and using all the facilities. Swimming at the pool, playing 
tennis, sailing on the lake—you get the picture. 
My wife, Sharon, later commented on the ride home, how nice it was 
that Marty took the time to share pictures of his home in Big Canoe 
and of his family and grandkids enjoying all that the community had 
to offer. While we were not in the market to purchase a property, it’s a 
wonder we didn’t buy a second home that weekend. 
3 - IDENTIFY THE PAIN AND INCREASE THE ANXIETY 
It is with rare exception that a person wakes up and decides, today I 
am going to buy myself a new car! Numerous studies confirm that the 
overwhelming majority of people are pushed into the market by an 
external force. Perhaps it is a new driver in the family who is heading 
off to college, a pregnancy that now requires a larger vehicle, a new job, 
a large repair bill, an accident, or theft. 
With that in mind, how important would it be for the success of the 
salesperson at the dealership to fully understand, “Why are you looking 
to replace or add a vehicle to your household?”
Yet, so many salespeople want to start the conversation by prematurely 
talking about the price and what a great DEAL they can get for you!
Linda Richardson, in her book Stop Telling, Start Selling, does a masterful 
job of explaining how effective questioning skills differentiate between 
the average and the exceptional sales professional. Your questions must 
not only uncover the need or pain, but must also emphasize the extensive 
difficulties that can arise if the issue is left unaddressed, thus increasing 
anxiety and the need to take action NOW.

209
RAISE YOUR SALES: RAISED AWARENESS INCREASES SALES EXECUTION
Developing a battery of thought-provoking and probing questions will 
ultimately separate you from your competitors, regardless of what you 
sell. 
You may say, Oh, but Kirk, I’m not a salesperson! Really. Have you 
ever persuaded someone to go eat Chinese food when the original plan 
was to go out for Italian? We’re all salespeople on some level.
4 - SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM AND SIMPLIFY THEIR LIVES
In 1985, my folks bought me a college ring for graduation from my 
alma mater Florida State University. I’ve never really been much for 
jewelry, so aside from my wedding band and a decent watch, this is the 
only jewelry item that I own. 
Realizing that I would want the ring to last a long time, I purchased it 
in 10-Karat gold, since it is harder (and less expensive) than 14-Karat 
gold. Even still, over the years the ring has needed attention. The local 
jeweler would clean it up as best they could and round out its shape 
every few years, so it would easily slide on and off my finger.
About 15 years ago, the stone and my fraternity letters were damaged. I 
shipped the ring back to the manufacturer and, other than paying for the 
shipping cost, they repaired the damage free of charge.
Last year, my ring had once again become flattened at the base as it 
typically does from use, and needed to be rounded out again. Off to the 
local jeweler I went, but this time the unthinkable happened. Instead of 
using a soft mallet and a ring sizer as support, the young man behind the 
counter used a very different tool with an outward expanding flange and 
managed to crack the base of the ring. I was furious.
After contacting the manufacturer, they suggested I ship the ring to them 
for inspection. They informed me that the ring was damaged beyond 
repair, but they would gladly melt down the ring and recast it for just 
$215, essentially producing a new ring. A new ring would have been 
more than five times that cost! All I can say is that if you want to keep 
your customers, solve their problem and simplify their lives.
By the way, the only company you should ever purchase a class ring 
from, in my opinion, is ArtCarved, which is now owned by Balfour. Just 
sayin’…

5 - EXPEDITE THE NEGOTIATION AND  
EXECUTE THE SALE
After more than 12 years as an independent sales trainer and consultant, 
the most common request I get for content is, “Can you teach me some 
new closes?” Like training, selling is a process and not an event. You 
don’t exercise and take care of yourself for years and then eat one piece 
of cheesecake and suddenly become overweight. Nor do you go to the 
gym for a week and look like the guy on the Bowflex commercial or the 
young beauties on Univision’s Nuestra Belleza Latina!
Closing happens as a result of making a connection with your prospect 
to uncover a problem that your product or service effectively addresses.
Here are the last two elements that will always come into play: negotiating 
the terms of the sale, and closing out the order with a commitment to 
take action.
First, prepare for the negotiation by understanding that most prospects 
will request a lower price. Be prepared to concede something to close 
the business, but on your terms. 
For example, if your paint and fabric protection only costs you $100 and 
the retail price is $500 then offer to sell it at cost. Sure you lose the $400 
in profit, but you will retain the full asking price of your main product, 
while still providing a $400 concession to the customer! 
To justify a reduction in unit price and close the sale, perhaps you can 
push back the delivery dates to reduce your costs or have the client agree 
to pay for shipping. Volume purchasing could also help justify a price 
concession. Selling in full pallet quantities means no labor loading the 
truck, only a forklift. Just remember, if you concede on pricing without 
the customer reciprocating a concession on some term or condition, you 
lose credibility for the pricing of your product or service. 
It’s ok to be creative when negotiating to come to an agreement. The 
important thing is to decide what you are willing to concede BEFORE 
the prospect asks you for a price concession. 
Lastly, you must secure a commitment to take action. Begin by deciding 
the outcome you seek when engaging the customer. Ask yourself, what 
is the desired outcome? Sell her the product? Sure, in the end that will

be the objective. However, there are often many steps to this journey 
and it likely begins with making contact with your prospect to set an 
appointment (either in person or via the phone/video) to discuss her 
situation in more detail.
More appointments will provide more quality conversations, creating 
the need for more presentations and proposals and, yes, in the end, 
will produce more sales. Learn to control what you can control—your 
activities. The sales will follow.
Write out the script for your close. This should consist of a series of 
five to seven questions that are structured in sequence to produce a 
predictable outcome. Be assumptive about the sale by explaining what 
the next steps will be in the process. Integrate either/or questions about 
quantity or delivery dates to keep the conversation moving forward. 
Sequential questioning assists your prospect in overcoming the natural 
tendency to procrastinate and put off their decision to do business 
together now! 
Strategies to Raise Your Sales Results:
1. Recognize your Ideal Client and Reduce Sales Resistance
•	 Apply Pareto’s Principle to both account management and 
prioritizing your time
•	 Birds of a feather flock together—Profile your top accounts and 
clone them
•	 Become the expert in your niche
2. Adapt to your Prospect and Acquire a Connection
•	 Apply the Law of Reciprocity—Obligation is your first step to a 
close 
•	 People buy from someone they Like and Trust—Use an evidence 
manual
•	 Speak your customer’s language—Understand their business
3. Identify the PAIN and Increase the Anxiety
•	 Find facts—Uncover their need—Understand their PAIN

TRANSFORM
212
•	 Thought-provoking and probing questions separate YOU from the 
competition 
•	 Create urgency to take action now by asking “What if?” questions
4. Solve Their Problem and Simplify Their Lives
•	 Make it easy for customers to do business with you
•	 Stand behind your work—Offer a money-back guarantee
•	 Look for solutions, not problems
5. Expedite the Negotiation and Execute the Sale
•	 Like training, selling is a process, NOT an event
•	 Make a connection = Make a sale
•	 Be prepared to concede something, but on your terms
Implement the sales principles above to transform yourself into an 
exceptional selling professional. Raise your standards and awareness 
to execute your sales strategy more effectively and consistently. Good 
luck and good selling, my friend!

push people around.

LIVING TO LEAVE A LEGACY!
CHAPTER 23
LIVING TO LEAVE  
A LEGACY!
BY KIT MATTSON
What a spectacular morning it is today. The sky is an amazing bright 
blue and the clouds look like puffy, white marshmallows. As I sit on 
my terrace relaxing overlooking the city as I do most mornings rain or 
shine, drinking coffee and going over all the things in my life that I am 
grateful and thankful for, as well as all the favor and blessings that God 
has given me, will give me and is currently giving me. I think, wow I’m 
blessed. I am also thankful for the day, because it is another opportunity 
to outdo, overcome, beat, defeat all obstacles the day might hold, as 
well as what was left undone and on my plate from yesterday. 
I have heard it said that great sailors are not made on smooth seas! Life 
wasn’t always like this and won’t always be like this I know, so when I 
have had turmoil in business or personal life, I use it as an opportunity 
to get better in every possible way.
It was the late ‘80s, oh yes, in Orange County…the O.C. were most 
everyone acts, walks, talks and looks like millionaires, but we know 
that’s impossible – at least in my neighborhood. We lived in an upper 
middle class white-collar neighborhood, even though my father was a 
super high-paid, blue collar, hard-working saver, tight- to-the-last-penny 
man. I was almost 20 years of age washing my car out front of the house 
when I noticed the neighbors up and down the street getting red tags on 
their houses and their cars repossessed in broad daylight. In less than an 

TRANSFORM
216
hour, I saw four car repossessed and three houses tagged with red slips. 
It was the most action and movement I had seen in the neighborhood 
in two years. I asked my Father what was going on. He told me interest 
rates were skyrocketing, and people couldn’t afford the variable loans 
they had taken out on their homes. So the banks were coming to collect 
property. I quickly panicked and started to worry. I asked if we had 
those same type of loans or problems. I asked if we were going to have 
to move as well or lose our cars. He put his hand on my shoulder and 
told me I had nothing to worry about, because he followed the Mattson 
legacy secrets his father told him. 
He asked me to sit down and he began to tell me the secrets to his and 
my grandfather’s success in life that I will now pass on to you. He told 
me of my grandfather in his 20’s was serving our country in Hawaii, 
and was a champion boxer in the navy. Then in his 30’s, he built a 
company. In his 40’s he lost it all. In his 50’s made it all back and then 
some. In his 60’s, he was a business owner. He passed away in his 70’s. 
All this was a culmination of his life. I said, I know all of this, but why 
are you telling me these things and what does it have to do with being 
successful in life? He then told me everyone is given seasons in life. 
My Grandfather was given 70 plus summers, 70 winters, 70 falls, 70 
springs, 70 Christmases, Easters, Birthdays, New Years. He maximized 
each season to the best of his abilities in business and in personal life. 
He then began to tell me that my grandfather sacrificed almost all his 
personal family time for business success. He said it was for him and his 
sisters and mother, so that they would never go without. My father said 
the Great Depression shaped my grandfather’s thoughts and actions, 
and that in turn shaped my father’s actions and thoughts as well. Wait. 
I do remember my father working all the time when I was growing up. 
Hardly ever home. I thought that this was a normal thing to only see my 
dad on weekends. Well, at least one day on the weekend. 
He told me, “Son, anyone can achieve success, financial security, riches, 
dreams, anything in life, as long as they are willing to trade something 
really valuable for it.” I thought…I have nothing of great value…I’m 
only 19! He told me why I had nothing to worry about. Like losing our 
things because he had traded a very valuable asset just like his father did 
before him for our family. Time!!! Time that he could never get back, 30 
years of his life with family, with friends, or watching sports or TV like 

217
LIVING TO LEAVE A LEGACY!
most normal people do in their daily life. All for his dream of success. 
My Dad said normal isn’t what he wanted for himself, my mother or 
their kids. He didn’t want a mediocre life. He then told me, “Son, the 
effort you put into your future is the future you will get. You put in 
excellent effort, you will get excellent rewards. You put in mediocre 
effort and you will get mediocre rewards. You put in poor effort, and 
you will be poor!” 
He asked me what kind and size of home I wanted to live in? I, of course 
,said, “A big one with a great view! Just like yours.” 
He then asked what kind of car I wanted to drive? A Porsche or a Pinto? 
I quickly said, “Are you kidding, I want a Porsche and a Jaguar.” 
He said I could have all that and more, but I needed to trade something 
of great value for it, and the sooner I make the trade, the sooner I will get 
and earn my dreams. Just like my grandfather accomplished his dreams, 
and my father most of his by this point. 
The last things he told me that afternoon were the most important he 
said. Always be grateful and thankful for all of your blessings you have 
been given, will be given and that you are enjoying now first from God, 
second from all the hard work and sacrifices your grandfather had made 
for me and now I make for you. We hugged, He told me he loved me. 
Then went to work.
Let’s fast forward four or five years. Now I am happily married and we 
are thinking of starting a family. I remember as if it were yesterday. My 
company started as a hobby in my garage just to make a few dollars here 
and there till I found something better to do. The hobby fast became 
very big, too big to stay in my garage. I was at a turning point and so 
was the hobby. Then I recalled the lessons my father had told me and 
taught to me my whole life, but really emphasized on the sit down talk 
we had in the O.C. 5 years ago. 
LESSON #1 - SEASONS!!! 
That kept ringing in my head. Thankfully, I listened to the ringing and 
picked up that phone, metaphorically speaking of course. The lesson on 
seasons had to be implemented. Know your days know your ways and 
I will tell you your future. I didn’t want to be a ship at sea without a 

TRANSFORM
218
rudder going nowhere. I want to be the master of my destiny and captain 
of my future! I sat down and looked at how I used my past seasons. All 
the holidays, days, weeks, months, years, winters, summers, springs and 
falls – where have they gotten me to this point in my life?
Sure, parties are fun when you’re young, but my grandfather used to say 
work hard while you can, so you can party when you want. I then began 
to write a very basic road map to success in different stages in my life. 
Where I wanted to be money-wise in my 30’s, 40’s; what I wanted to 
have at 35, 45 years old. Like the Jaguar and the big house. 
I had to decide right then and there that good enough just wasn’t good 
enough. I made excellence my standard on all that I did. Nothing in the 
beginning was perfect, far from it, but my resolve was that of making 
excellence so that I could attain excellent rewards. Not so much detail, 
but a basic outline on goals, you know, the American Dream. When I sat 
down and planned a season outline, it became real and not just a dream. 
I could and did see myself in the future getting my dreams and goals 
accomplished. If you believe, you achieve. I heard that somewhere. All 
of this had to be done by the young age of 50 years old! 
LESSON #2 - THE TRADE 
Use time wisely! The funny thing with this is that I know my father was 
always working long hours and gone all the time. He would sleep, eat, 
and go back to work. He did this for 42 years. It was time he had given 
up for his success. I have heard eight hours is for survival and ten hours 
is for success. So I decided for the next 20 years of my life that I would 
outwork and outthink anyone in my industry. It was 12 to 15 hour days 
and sometimes longer. I’ll sleep when I made it. I also would trade my 
time for my dreams, and my future seasons of success that I had planned 
and envisioned, I would attain. I made excellence my standard on all 
that I did daily. I pushed the limits and set new ones on what could be 
accomplished in my industry. I always found the best in other industries 
and asked why them? What do they do that sets them apart? What makes 
them the best in their industry? 
How can I apply and implement the basic elements that they use: effort-
integrity-outstanding service-fantastic product-belief-faith-efficiency-
blind implementation-education—into my company? I went on a quest 
for knowledge. I learned all that I could as fast as I could about business, 

219
LIVING TO LEAVE A LEGACY!
marketing, relationships, my industry, other industries.
So I would benefit from all of the best ideas and wisdom that I had 
gained by trading my time. If I was going to trade all of my time, I 
wanted it to payoff big, Real Big! The Bible says in Proverbs: Work 
brings profit but mere talk leads to poverty. So I trained and worked my 
mind, body and soul daily – focused always on the prizes in the future 
that were on my seasons list.
I never listened to the naysayers, who seem to be all mediocre and like 
to settle for second and third place. You know what Vince Lombardi 
said about Second place? Nothing! If you look at all of the winners in 
life, they have always given something up for success – time, money, 
energy, sleep, something. We have all seen the stories of the Olympic 
athletes that sacrificed all kinds of things just to get a chance to “Go For 
The Gold.” Sacrifice the Trade is the key.
A choice must be made and that decision must be final, and the results 
must be attained no matter what. My focus for the last 20 plus years, 
and for years to come will be on defending myself and my family from 
mediocrity. It is now a habit. It has become second nature. The habits 
we train are habits we gain. My friend T.R. says that and it is the truth. 
So now you know how to track, trade and make season goals. 
Review these weekly, daily, they are your road maps for life’s successes. 
You also now know what and how to trade for success! This is a must 
for any traveler on the highway of success, at least in the fast lane in the 
Porsche or Jaguar! 
LESSON #3 - BEING GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL
This is really the key to it all! Why I say that is being in the state of 
gratefulness and thankfulness for your seasons successes is only in the 
daily reflection of the journey of the victories in the past and present. 
There are no victories without celebrations, and that’s why you should 
go through all the things you are thankful and grateful for daily. 
My son, brother, nephew and I all recently went to see the modern day 
Elisha, Joel Osteen speak at a packed convention center on Christianity. 
It was amazing on how he spoke of sacrifices Jesus made for us, and 
how in turn we should be grateful for this, and how we didn’t have to 

TRANSFORM
220
earn any of it. He gave freely to us. Later we got to meet with him back 
stage and talk for a bit. I could see the joy, gratefulness and thankfulness 
coming from him like a glow. I know it sounds crazy but it’s true. I 
know he is trying to live up to his father’s legacy and leave one himself. 
I have been told I have a joy and gratefulness and thankfulness about 
me as well. 
I hope I can glow half as much as Joel, but that is what Gratefulness 
and Thankfulness on a daily basis creates. Daily saying thank you for 
your favor and your blessing you have been given, will be given, and 
are receiving now!
Wow! Like I was thinking, what a fantastic day. The sky is truly amazing 
and my coffee is fantastic. I am very thankful for my family, my friends, 
my health, my mind, my business, my clients, my students, all my 
blessings! This is how you really feel Rich all your life!
I now entrust the Mattson Season Success Legacy to you. Your Choice! 
Live your Dreams, or as my father says, “Make it Happen, Captain!” 
I need to get another cup of coffee.

THE TRANSFORMATIVE  
MARKETING MACHINE  
THAT WORKS HARDER  
THAN YOU DO—SO  
YOU DON’T HAVE TO
BY GREG ROLLETT
You can’t save souls in an empty church.  
~ David Ogilvy
It occurred to me that entrepreneurs and business owners are under the 
assumption that the customers that walk into your door, find their way 
to your website or dial up your phones, is out of their control. That by 
random acts of marketing, they never know who is going to call or what 
they are going to want. 
This is a crying shame. 
It means that you are still trying to be everything to everyone. And that 
is a sure sign that your business is in trouble. 
The truth is that you have the ability and the responsibility to be 
everything to the right type of customer or client, and actually repel 
those that you cannot, will not or have no desire to help. 

TRANSFORM
224
Marketing gives you that ability. You can be polarizing and that is a 
good thing in marketing. And the first step is to determine who it is you 
want to do business with. Yes, tell yourself who it is you want to walk 
through your door, visit and interact with your website and pick up the 
phone and dial your office. 
Start by going down the list:
Age
Male/Female
Married/Single
Kids/No kids
Location
Occupation/Industry
Then start to look at some of the intangibles:
Hobbies
Interests
Political affiliations
Religion
Personal beliefs
Life stages
When you put it together, you should have the description of an ideal 
client or customer that you genuinely want to and can help. It is the 
person that is most valuable to you and your business, not just the riff-
raff that came waltzing off the street. 
These should be your easy to manage, high profit and lowest headache 
clients and customers. The ones that get what you do, value it and value 
you. 
When I first got started marketing my own products, I was selling 
information products to musicians, helping them to market their band 
and their music. I was not looking for any musician with a guitar 
and a song book. I was looking for a specific type of musician. I was 
specifically on the hunt for the singer-songwriter, in their mid to late 
20’s, who was working in hospitality, eating Ramen Noodles, playing 

225
THE TRANSFORMATIVE MARKETING MACHINE THAT WORKS HARDER THAN YOU DO
cover songs at the bars on the weekends, wearing khaki shorts and 
rocking a backwards hat. 
I knew his problem, his fears and desires. I also knew he didn’t know 
how to promote or market his music. More than anything in the world, 
he wanted to quit his job and play music to pay the bills. 
Did jazz musicians or wedding bands or hip-hop artists make their 
way into my customer base? Sure they did. But some were also turned 
off. And that’s great, because I filled my pipeline with musicians that 
understood who I was and what I was able to do for them, the riff-raff 
never got into my machine. 
Once you understand who it is that you want and desire to do business 
with, you need to determine who you want to be to that market. You 
must become their hero, their advocate, their trusted advisor. 
DEVELOPING YOUR SUPER HERO POSITIONING
You develop hero-like or legendary positioning by telling your story 
and making a direct connection to your audience. 
Your story is the most powerful and valuable weapon you have in your 
bag of tricks. And when you use it, you will be the heavy favorite in 
a Vegas title bout, playing in the heavy-weight division squaring off 
against weakling 100-lb, dripping-wet-from-the-ears business owners 
who are fighting to get business by lowering prices and succumbing to 
the opportunities at the bottom of the barrel. Superheroes are looking 
for the opportunity to save the world, make the headlines and get the 
girl. Let your competition direct traffic or give out parking tickets. 
I want to put this into context for you. Let’s say you are a financial 
advisor. And you know there are dozens upon dozens of other advisors 
in your market all going after the same ideal client - affluent, pre-retiree, 
conservative, married, kids in college or working and living in a certain 
part of town. 
Every week this market gets invitations to seminars, workshops and 
dinners. They are being sold to on every corner. And they are being 
pitched, prodded, poked and invaded from people that have no connection 
to them whatsoever—just salesmen with a brochure hawking the latest 
products that promise to beat the market.

TRANSFORM
226
This is where you have the ability to be their hero…to rip off your suit 
and become the knight in shining armor…to be the admiration of your 
market. And you start by telling your story to this market from the get-
go. 
Much like every Batman or Superman movie starts with the telling and 
demonstration of their origin story, you too must do the same. You tell 
this story to reveal to them that you understand them, their situation 
and their desires. You do this to establish authority, positioning and 
credibility. It shows that you are not a scary monster like everyone else 
hunting in the marketplace. 
When you write, develop and share your story, you get to decide who 
you get to be to this market by drawing on your past and your present. 
You get to design your costume and explain your superpowers.
You might begin a letter by sharing how you got involved with financial 
planning, starting when your grandparents needed help from your 
parents to make it through retirement and then explain your parents 
poor planning habits, which led to your own revelation that this type of 
thinking and investing had to stop for future generations. 
What if you are a business coach or consultant? Maybe you share the 
story behind your first business that was failing miserably until you 
found a coach that helped you. Now you are paying that forward to help 
others with their businesses. 
Or you might be someone who grew up in the community, played Little 
League here, went away to college and then came back to help the 
community grow and prosper. 
These are all stories people can relate to. They are stories we recognize 
and plotlines that are familiar. And the underlying tone is that you 
understand what they are going through and can help them. 
Once they make this connection, it’s time to perform the most important 
part of any marketing system, the offer. You see, there is only one way 
that I know how to make money in a business. Send an offer. Make an 
attempt to exchange value for money. Heck, even McDonald’s makes 
offers. What do you think their $1 Menu is? It’s a sales letter. It’s a flyer. 
It’s a promotion designed to exchange money for value. 

227
THE TRANSFORMATIVE MARKETING MACHINE THAT WORKS HARDER THAN YOU DO
DEVELOPING AN OFFER MACHINE
Your profits are directly related to the frequency of value-added offers 
you make to your target market that we defined above. 
Here is the biggie to get from this. The offer must solve a problem that 
your market has and it must resolve a core desire that they have. Note 
that I never said anything about cool features or even benefits. There is a 
time and a place for both, but right now you need to be a problem solver. 
You need to be seen as the trusted advisor that can move your prospect 
closer to their core desire. 
What is a core desire? It’s what we really want. It goes beyond the 
surface level wants that everyone else is selling to, and speaks to your 
market on an emotional level. 
Many weight loss experts will tell you that their system will help you 
lose 20 pounds. So what? Everyone says that. 
You are the person that gives them confidence to start a new life…to 
have the confidence to get out in the field and find true love…to make 
them look their best when delivering a presentation…that helps them to 
live long enough to see their grandkids graduate from high school. 
You are the trainer who gets people the photos that make them look like 
a million bucks on their wedding day, or on the cruise with their in-laws. 
Maybe you run a pool cleaning service. Think about selling desires, not 
benefits. You’re not selling a blue, crystal clear pool. You are selling 
the place where you can host your kids’ 5th birthday party or have the 
annual 4th of July party or even be the envy of your entire neighborhood. 
You are even selling time - not having to wake up on Saturday morning 
to go and clean the pool, but to actually swim in and enjoy the pool. 
That is what your market really wants. Having a blue, crystal clear pool 
helps us to get there and is the product that you sell, but you need to be 
much more than that. You need to be a hero, remember? 
When someone thinks of you, get them thinking about how you impacted 
and affected their life, not just the job you performed. 
Now you have to make an offer to fill this desire. Most business owners 

TRANSFORM
228
will try and go for the kill on the first attempt. You are going to be 
smarter. You know that consumers today need information. They need 
more than just a coupon, they need to know they are getting the best. 
Remember we are only going after the perfect audience, not anyone 
searching for the low-price provider or who is running a special discount 
this month. We want the client that understands how you make their life 
better and sees you as the only person that can solve their problem and 
fills their desire. 
Therefore you need to tell them about this transformation. And you 
do so through marketing. It is not evil to be a marketer. It is actually 
beneficial. When someone is made aware of what you do to satisfy their 
desires, they thank you for that by exchanging their money for your 
services. That’s what it’s all about, right?
The first goal of any marketing campaign is to generate leads. You want 
to activate a targeted portion of your overall market that has raised their 
hand to hear and learn more from you. At this stage of the game, you 
are not yet selling your products or services, simply building a pool of 
interested prospects who want to know more. 
This group is volunteering to learn more. They have gone out of their 
way to call your office or recorded message, visit your website, fill out a 
form or stop in to your office and inquire more about what you do. 
It does not mean they are ready to buy. It means they are ready to listen. 
It is your responsibility to give them something worth listening to. 
And you must continue to work with them, educate them and inspire 
and motivate them for the long-haul. 
DEVELOPING YOUR POWER POSITIONING
Through this brand of marketing, you want to be seen in a field of one... 
as the only logical choice your prospect can and will do business with. 
When they first raise their hand in the lead generation process and 
initiate contact, you want to be ready with a sequence that pre-frames 
them to know who you are, what you do and how you can help them. 
This can be done through mailing out a Shock- And-Awe package, a big 
box of your best materials designed to shock and awe the prospect to all 

229
THE TRANSFORMATIVE MARKETING MACHINE THAT WORKS HARDER THAN YOU DO
of the incredible things you are doing and the people you are helping. 
When a prospect opens it, they are completely blown away. They literally 
stop in their tracks, open your package and start to go through all of the 
assets, the materials, the testimonials, the videos and the pieces you 
have put together that will help steer them towards working with you.
But a Shock-And-Awe package alone is not enough. In order to win 
in business today, to transform the lives of your clients and customers 
as well as your own bank account, you must be seen everywhere your 
market turns. 
You want to be famous to the people that raise their hands. You want 
to show up in their mailbox and their inbox. You want to be seen and 
heard. You want to be read. You want to take up a position in their social 
sphere where they are thinking about you on a regular basis. In essence, 
you want to be a celebrity in their eyes. 
To do this, you must develop a marketing sequence that is sent out 
automatically, no matter if you, or your staff, are staying on top of your 
new leads and prospects. 
Otherwise, it won’t happen. I know because it happens to me. When 
I am left to remember to do these things myself, on my own time, 
other things get in the way. Using automated tools, and developing 
systems and sequences that are created and written at one time, and 
then leveraged with technology and fulfillment partners, ensure that you 
never miss a beat and your marketing machine runs in the background – 
spoon-feeding you new business that has been Shocked and Awe’d, seen 
your videos, heard you via audio or Podcasts, is getting mail pieces, 
emails and everything but the kitchen sink, in a sequential manner that 
advances the sale. 
During this entire process, you never want to forget to inject yourself 
into the equation. You must continue to advance the sales process by 
inserting you into the marketing equation…sharing stories, not features 
and benefits…sharing resources and information to help them see you 
as a trusted advisor. You want them to see you for more than just what 
you do. You want them to do business with you because of who you are. 
Once you do this, you will have a customer or client for life. And your 
business will forever be transformed.

50 WAYS TO DELIVER A FIVE-STAR EXPERIENCE IN A MEDICAL PRACTICE
CHAPTER 25
50 WAYS TO DELIVER  
A FIVE-STAR EXPERIENCE  
IN A MEDICAL PRACTICE
BY DAVID J. WAGES, M.D.
INTRODUCTION
When was the last time you went to a physician’s office and thought 
you were treated so special that you felt like you were the President or 
a member of the Royal Family? The experience was so memorable, that 
you just could not forget about it for days. You told all your friends. If 
you said “never,” then it’s more likely that you had an experience filled 
with frustration, lengthy waiting, and so unpleasant you just dreaded 
it. The good news is that it does not have to be that way. It can be 
transformed and you can begin it today. 
What is a five-star patient experience in the medical practice and why 
is it important? Some people would say that five-star service is being 
treated like you were an important person or that you were special. 
Others may say it is having a positive emotional experience, a carefree 
event without problems or headaches. You should strive to make the 
patient feel so good that by just being in your office they feel better, 
even before they have seen the physician. The experience should be 
uplifting and memorable. When patients receive five-star customer 
service, it will transform your practice to one that patients will love. 

TRANSFORM
232
It also leads to improved staff morale, and decreased liability. Your staff 
will need to transform their attitudes and interactions to be successful. 
Before your staff can deliver a unique experience to patients, they must 
develop a culture of treating each other special. Achieving a five-star 
experience is not simply a list of items to do. It is not just what you do 
or say but how you deliver it. It is a transformation of how you treat 
patients and staff. You must develop passion to do this. You will find 
that it will be well worth it. 
I will be giving you examples of ways to get started on delivering a 
five-star experience for your practice. There is not one single item that 
is going to make a difference, but many little items that will impact 
the patient experience. During this process, you must keep in mind that 
everything matters, attention to detail is imperative. Some of these items 
are subliminal to the patient. You must get your office team on board 
with your mission. The staff must understand and be committed. Put 
your commitment on display for the patients and staff. “We are a five-
star practice. We strive to go above and beyond any physician office 
you may have been in before. If things are not to your expectation, 
please let us know and we will be happy to improve your experience!” 
This generates accountability. I will describe a few areas to improve 
the patient experience including: the office environment, the staff 
interaction, the physician interaction, and some bonus ideas. 
ENVIRONMENT
Start with having clear, accurate, and easy directions. Before a new 
patient shows up, they have made an appointment and need to find your 
office. Even with a GPS, directions can be confusing. You should have 
directions that are accurate and easily understood. Upon arriving to the 
parking lot, is the signage clearly visible? Is the parking lot clean and 
well-marked? Is the entrance obvious? If the patient has a difficult time 
finding your office or parking, this creates stress and anxiety. You are 
officially at a disadvantage for making a good first impression.
These are areas that can aggravate patients if they have a difficult time 
finding parking, and are feeling stressed about being lost because the 
directions to the office were inadequate or inaccurate. Find ways to 
make it easier for the patients by having clear directions and an obvious 
sign that says, “This is the place.” 

233
50 WAYS TO DELIVER A FIVE-STAR EXPERIENCE IN A MEDICAL PRACTICE
Upon entering the office, it should appeal to the senses. An office 
with warm, earth-tone colors is more appealing. Have aromatherapy 
throughout the practice to create a soothing environment. Attractive 
plants liven up an office. In place of radio, have soothing, relaxing 
background music. Cleanliness and neatness are of the utmost 
importance. Are the vents clean and dust free? Are the carpets old and 
worn out? In a medical practice, carpets that are older than five years 
should be replaced due to soiling, as well as wear and tear. Remove all 
clutter. Having too many old magazines that are worn and outdated is 
messy. Eliminate the gossip magazines. Consider limiting magazines 
to just a few higher quality ones. Having warm colors, having a fresh 
appearance, cleanliness and the elimination of clutter, sends a message 
that this office provides a different experience.
Go to the restrooms. Are there any special amenities? Consider having 
some mints, fragrances, and hand lotion for patients use. In the waiting 
area, do you offer refreshments? Having a refrigerator with bottled 
water and napkins is a nice touch, having a coffee maker and spa water 
dispenser with your lemon-flavored water is even more impressive. 
STAFF INTERACTION
How long does a patient have to wait before the staff acknowledges 
them with eye contact? If it is more than five seconds then there is 
room for improvement. Having eye contact within the first two seconds 
should be the standard. The welcome should be warm and friendly, not 
a dry, bored or miserable grunt. A smile and a warm genuine voice is a 
good beginning. 
How does one sound excited and energetic performing the welcome 
multiple times a day? Actors on Broadway do this multiple times a day 
and so can you. It is called work. It takes effort, but it is worth it. Use 
the patient’s name. People love to hear their name. It makes people feel 
welcome and appreciated. Don’t let a difficult pronunciation hinder you. 
People love that you tried. Instead of a simple “hello, how are you?” 
encourage your staff to compliment the patient on how they look. “Oh 
what a nice dress! Oh the shoes look great on you! Did you change 
your hair? Have you lost weight?” If you only ask the patient how they 
are, then it makes you susceptible to a grumpy patient downloading on 
your staff and stirring up negative emotions. However, when the patient 

TRANSFORM
234
comes in who may be in a grumpy mood and you compliment them on 
their appearance or express what a pleasure it is to see them again, you 
have created a different outcome. 
Upgrade your name badges. Spice them up with an idea from Disney. 
Below the name of the person is a trait, such as: “I have a Pug” or “Red 
Sox fan” or a zodiac sign. This is an icebreaker for interaction between 
the patient and staff. Staff should be cheerful, friendly, big smiles and 
a helping nature. Staff should have well-rehearsed scripts and language 
regarding what they should say for the most common interactions. The 
Ritz Carlton uses “My pleasure”, or “At your service.” Remember, it is 
not just what you say but also how you say it.
Instead of pushing a clipboard in front of the patient to fill out necessary 
registration forms, try coming around the desk, welcoming the patient, 
giving them a handwritten welcome note to the practice on nice 
stationary in an envelope. Once the patient is ready to be seen, the staff 
would greet the patient using their name. Patients should hear their name 
five times from initial greeting to physician meeting. As they escort the 
patient to the exam room, give a brief tour of the office. Show them 
where the bathroom is, and where the exam room is, and as you pass 
different offices, introduce the staff. “Oh this is Colleen, she is in charge 
of billing, this to Suzy, she is in charge of patient accounts and this 
person is Brendan, who is our manager.” This type of attention lets them 
know that they are being welcomed in to your family and your practice. 
Have a scripted dialogue with the patient. Begin credentialing the office. 
These are things that you may take for granted that patients do not know. 
“You are going to love Dr. Patrick, he has been Board Certified for ten 
years, all of his patients enjoy his bedside manner, etc.” Reinforce that 
you are grateful they came to see you. It is nice for them to hear that 
from staff. For new patients, once they arrive into the room, have a 
small welcome gift. This does not have to be an expensive gift. For a 
few dollars you can get a mug, water bottle, tote bag, or an umbrella. 
Have it personalized with a note letting them know that you appreciate 
their business. It’s like inviting somebody into your home and sharing 
with them the things that are important. 

235
50 WAYS TO DELIVER A FIVE-STAR EXPERIENCE IN A MEDICAL PRACTICE
PHYSICIAN INTERACTION
Once the patient is seated, the physician should be introduced in a 
professional manner. Professional introductions set the level of respect 
for the physician. Always introduce the most important person first 
then a brief handoff such as: “Dr. Patrick, this is Ms. Matthews. Ms. 
Matthews is here for a routine physical examination. This is her first 
visit and she comes from Lexington.” The physician now begins the 
visit. Before diving in and focusing on the patient’s chief complaint, 
pause and spend a couple of minutes visiting with the patient. Once you 
have done this if the patient needs to undress for an exam then step out 
of the room, let them change, then perform the exam. Having that extra 
couple of minutes of rapport with the patient to establish a relationship is 
important before performing a sensitive exam. Once the visit is over, the 
patient is handed off to an assistant who escorts them out and likewise 
hands them off in a professional manner to be checked out.
BONUS ITEMS
Who doesn’t like to get an unexpected gift? This could be something 
as simple as a handwritten thank you note or a small gift. Patients are 
surprised and appreciative of little details that can make them feel 
special and important. Things you may want to consider would be an 
unexpected occasional gift such as roses on Valentine’s Day. This could 
be done inexpensively when buying in bulk. Remember the presentation 
is just as important as the gift. Make it special. There is a difference 
between simply handing them a rose versus a rose that has been trimmed, 
wrapped with colored tissue paper, tied with a ribbon and a handwritten 
note saying: “Thank you, We appreciate you, You are valued.” These 
are items that your staff will be happy to do once they see the smiles 
that are created. In addition to flowers, you could consider homemade 
cookies, small candies, thank you cards, birthday cards and thank you 
notes after visits. 
SUMMARY
These were just a few items to get your creative juices flowing. Realize 
there are always going to be ways to do better. Once you get involved 
with the process you will find the more you study it, the more creative 
you become in providing benefits that improve the patient’s experience. 
The more you implement these ideas, the more you will improve. This 

TRANSFORM
236
will help create an office that patients look forward to visiting. Your staff 
will be proud of their accomplishments. When your staff is on board 
with delivering the ultimate patient experience, all of these suggestions 
will easily fall into place and be executed. It takes diligence, attention 
to detail, planning and persistence to maintain the pursuit of perfection. 
The five-star service is not only what you do and say, but also how you 
execute it. 
ACTION ITEM
Have a working brunch for your staff at a nice restaurant, such as The 
Four Seasons or The Ritz Carlton. Give each staff member the assignment 
to come up with a list of all the things that made their experience at the 
brunch special, things that made them feel important and appreciated. 
Ask them how they can implement these items. The person who has the 
list with the most useful information on it will then be the recipient of 
a gift prize. This will be a fun and learning experience for your entire 
team.

ALIVE AND SUCCESSFUL!
CHAPTER 26
ALIVE AND SUCCESSFUL!
BY DR. TAYO
So… I get admitted to medical school and a new phase of my life 
begins. Along with that are expectations - huge ones! This is a long five-
year journey with no guarantees, but my (and a whole number of other 
people’s) expectation is for me to become a certified and practicing 
physician at the end of it. I have my work cut out.
Will I actually get to graduate as a doctor? There is no doubt in my 
mother’s mind that I will, but I am not so sure. This will take five years 
- a very long time in the life of a teenager, almost a third of my life so 
far. One thing I know for sure is that I have to settle down quickly; study 
and learn, if I am to get that medical degree at the other end. It is a giddy 
thought – I’m both excited and fearful, often at the same time.
The first challenge came up quickly - to pass the first set of exams: 
Biochemistry, Physiology and Anatomy. For me, that was a big hurdle. 
Our main recommended physiology textbook, Sampson Wright’s 
Applied Physiology, was pretty tough going. At best, I would manage 
two pages a day, but some of my fellow students were able to read many 
more. One in particular would come into class and tell us he’d read 50 
pages overnight! I couldn’t understand how that was possible, but I tried 
hard to increase my reading speed. Comprehension did not follow. 
I then decided to wake up to read at night. When that didn’t work, I 
asked some friends to wake me up, but the next morning, I was still very 

TRANSFORM
240
much in bed - and had not gotten out of it! The next step was to make 
sure I got out of bed and to our reading room, where I would promptly 
put the book in my lap, my head on the table and go to sleep. Ahhh!
Something needed to happen, and fast! It soon dawned on me that 
following other people’s habits and reading at night obviously did not 
work for me. When I analyzed my study habits, I did better when I 
attended lectures live, after which I would read to build on what I had 
read. So that’s what I did and still do to this day.
What happened? At the physiology exams, I passed so well that I was 
one of only four students from my year and the only female (out of 
a class of 200 – including 20 females) who was offered the option to 
spend just one more year to earn a B.Sc. Physiology degree, a direct 
result of our high scores. One of the others was my 50 page per day 
friend! I decided to continue with my medical studies. Five years was 
already plenty - I did not want to make it six.
A few years later, I was at an interview, held a few weeks before taking 
the specialty certification exams. During the interview, it was made 
clear to me that the offer of a position was conditional on my passing 
those exams. I confidently replied that I would. I wasn’t being arrogant 
- it was a knowing based on my application of the 5 key success steps I 
had defined and practiced. Even the interviewers could not understand 
why I was so confident.
This was the moment I realized it was critical to share this information to 
help as many people as possible. We face challenging and overwhelming 
situations every day. We could come through them, living happy and 
successful lives simply by following what I’d discovered. 
It is my mission to spread the word that SUCCESS IS A CHOICE. That 
is the very start of any journey to success.
1. BE THE MASTER CREATOR OF YOUR LIFE!
What took me from feeling overwhelmed to being tuned in to success? 
The gateway, the most important aspect, is to take personal responsibility 
for your entire life. Your brain will be rewired to take the successful 
path. Once you are able to take responsibility for the not-so-good things 
that have happened in your life, you now have the power to turn things 

241
ALIVE AND SUCCESSFUL!
around and be THE creator, creating great things instead. Successful 
people don’t have victim mentalities. 
Be very firm about this and aware that opportunities will come your 
way when you focus on your goal. Have POSITIVE EXPECTANCY - 
expect whatever you set out to do to be successful, and be prepared to 
sort things out when obstacles appear. 
Your subconscious directs your actions over 95% of the time, but you can 
influence your subconscious by choosing what you allow to influence 
it. Until you choose to do so, it’ll be dominated by your fears and other 
negative thoughts and beliefs, affecting you physically, emotionally and 
mentally.
Make it YOUR choice whether to take an opportunity or not. Decide 
to say either no or yes, accepting full responsibility for either decision. 
Do not abdicate that choice. Procrastinating or being passive is worse 
than a “no” decision. Let’s be clear about this: to take advantage of 
an opportunity, you need to put in effort. Work is required to turn that 
opportunity into the success it will be. Eliminate the word “try” from 
your vocabulary - that word is setting you up - for failure! Decide to 
either do or not do, making a firm decision either way. When you say 
you’ll “try” to do anything, it weakens you. How you appear to the 
world is also weakened. 
Now that you have got the mindset of the master creator of your life, it’s 
time to focus on how to do it. 
2. PURPOSE & CLARITY
Be purposeful about what you want, and the most important question 
here is WHY? That’s because we all have a purpose, and the closer you 
come to aligning with your purpose, the more successful you will be. 
Your Purpose is a combination of what and why. 
The two most important days in your life are the  
day you are born and the day you find out why.  
~ Mark Twain
The first thing in discovering your purpose is to recognize that it does 
not have to be this big thing, this world-changing story, movement 

TRANSFORM
242
or product. Your purpose may be important to one person, but to that 
person, it is life-changing. Your purpose may be to be a great mother, to 
teach kindergarten with passion, or to care for seniors in a home. 
You can count on this: Your purpose will make you happy, and once 
you’re happy, you’ll be successful. This is not the time to buy into some 
other person’s big dream for you. You have the freedom to design your 
life to your exact specifications.
Here are two simple exercises to help you out. The first one is a 
brainstorming session. Take out a blank sheet of paper and write down 
100 things that you want to do, like doing or that enchant you. Let your 
mind open up – any dream is up for grabs. Leave out the how and the 
why, just write without censoring. Next, trim that list down to ten and 
look for any common ideas between them. Then, pick just one thing 
from that list. It will be something that gives you the most joy and 
probably has several other items on your list linked to it.
The second exercise is to dig deeper and is essential. For your top pick, 
keep asking why it’s important, until you’re left speechless or with a 
vast sense of peace and wonder, feeling like you just discovered the holy 
grail. One thing I can share with you - money is never the end of that 
sequence of Why’s - it’s nearer the top. Dig deep beyond that!
By the time you’ve been through both exercises, you’ll have gained 
significant insights.
Once you’ve defined your purpose, it tends not to change. What 
may change, and frequently does, is your goal, which, for maximum 
effectiveness, is designed around your purpose.
Successful people make decisions quickly and change their minds 
slowly. That is because they are clear about what they are doing and 
why they are doing it. 
Gaining clarity also gives you the ability to deal with the inevitable 
doubts and fears that will come along by asking - What kinds of things 
can go wrong? What are you afraid of? What’s the very worst that can 
happen? Would that really be the end of the world? Can you lessen the 
risk sufficiently that it is not such a disaster that will stop you from 
moving forward?

243
ALIVE AND SUCCESSFUL!
3. GOALS 
Now that you’ve discovered your purpose, it’s time to develop goals 
to help things along. Knowing your purpose will drive your goal and 
defining your goal will feed your purpose. Of the various goal-setting 
processes I have used, the easiest and friendliest are a series of W 
questions. 
You don’t have to do them in any particular order, and it’s easier to 
remember than most other goal-setting techniques.
The first, Why, has been taken care of when you did the exercises to 
unearth your purpose.
Who is going to help you? Who must you talk to? Who can be a coach 
or mentor to help speed things along? Who offers expert services in 
areas that you can’t do yourself?
What do you want EXACTLY? No time for wishy-washy ideas here - 
you need to be definite. If you can’t describe it easily in a sentence or 
two to someone else who then understands what you mean, go back to 
the drawing board and redo!
When to start? That’s an easy one - its NOW!! How long will it take, 
and when is the target completion date?
Where will you be located? Is this a physical location, an online store, 
a book you are writing? Your intellectual property needs a home. Give 
it one.
A great goal will excite, stretch and scare you, all at the same time. You 
want to fulfill your purpose, so taking a few chances are worth it. You 
may have to break a big goal down into smaller ones. If so, do only one 
at a time, or confusion may follow pretty quickly.
The closer your goal takes you towards your purpose, the stronger will 
be your incentive to complete it. To set a strong goal, ask yourself how 
far it takes you along the road to fulfilling your purpose? If it takes you 
most or all the way, you’ll probably persist a lot harder than if it was 
only a minor component.
Now that you’ve set great goals, time to figure out HOW to get them 
done! 

TRANSFORM
244
4. ACTION PLAN AND ACTION
This is where you look at your goal and draw a map to help you get 
there. The more detailed the map, the better your chances of arriving 
at your destination. This part is also very important - not having a plan 
pretty much leaves your chances of your reaching your goal, as well as 
fulfilling your purpose, to chance - those odds are not good. 
Have you chosen a safe goal? Probably. I can say that because, for most 
people, setting a more challenging goal evokes the fear of failure. It’s 
time to toss that one out of the window and ascend to a higher level of 
potential and mastery!
Based on research, you are capable of at least four times the goal you 
set, but you decided to play it safe so you do not feel like a failure. Let’s 
stretch this a bit (not too much) and double that goal. How do you feel? 
A bit anxious but excited? Here is something to consider. If you don’t 
stretch yourself, you won’t reach your full potential and will probably 
end up feeling dissatisfied. This is where you detach the results from 
your fears. ALL results are great! They have no other meaning! 
Make a commitment to start RIGHT NOW. Start by doing something 
to immediately anchor it into your mind; or your great idea, plan or 
goal will get tossed aside then forgotten, along with all the other 60,000 
thoughts that come and go through your mind each day. 
Here is one thing I know for sure: if you commit to this, you WILL 
make it work!
5. MOMENTUM: SUSTAINING IT ALL
So how do you go about staying the course? Simple – by developing 
the discipline and habits necessary to sustain a successful life: building 
habits through daily practices. Think of it like training for a marathon or 
nurturing your plants. Piling on a months training (if that is possible) in 
one day will probably end up as a serious injury or illness, even if you 
are fit. 
The road to success is consistent training in bite sizes.
Decide what habits you want to build and start doing them consistently. 
A great way to nurture a habit is to reward yourself when you’ve formed 

245
ALIVE AND SUCCESSFUL!
a habit that helps you towards your goal. Choose something meaningful, 
but not painful or vastly expensive and not something that will affect 
your progress; for example, you really don’t want to reward a positive 
dietary change with food.
Of all the habits out there, the one I would encourage you to develop 
first is GRATITUDE. Don’t underestimate how powerful this simple 
tool is. When you practice gratitude, your brain releases more of the 
neurotransmitter substance called dopamine, which stimulates the 
pleasure center of your brain, relieves stress, helps you sleep better, 
fights cravings and controls your appetite! This also strengthens your 
immune system, improving your health. You too can access all this for 
the cost of a cup or two of great quality coffee.
As soon as you can after reading this (I suggest within 5 days), buy 
yourself a really nice looking journal, one that is a reflection of the 
success you see in your life. I like journals with faint ruled lines. At the 
end of every day, just before you go to sleep, write in the date, then write 
down five things that you are grateful for on that particular day. This 
process allows you to reflect and feel as you write, making gratitude a 
stronger part of how you assess your day and your last thoughts before 
you go to sleep. 
Since you have to write five things every day, you’ll always be on the 
look out, which is why this is such a powerful habit. The changes that 
happen from this habit are life changing. I’ve been doing this for several 
years, and clients have reported how powerful it is. 
You’ll become more aware and appreciative of people, things and 
situations. That lifelong habit of gratitude in any situation is the true 
source of Happiness and Success.
I will also encourage you to make sure you enjoy the journey, including 
all the obstacles you encounter. The scenery can be stunning.

HOW YOU TURN YOUR WEAKNESSES INTO STRENGTHS 
CHAPTER 27
HOW YOU TURN  
YOUR WEAKNESSES  
INTO STRENGTHS 
BY THOMAS FRIEBE
Have you ever given a speech? In front of a larger group of people? Say, 
in front of at least 30 people? No? Unfortunately, if you want to promote 
your business, your career or yourself, there is no way around it. Before 
you start turning pages now, take a deep breath. On the following pages 
you will learn how to shed your fear of public speaking and, if you 
already are a practiced speaker, even how to improve on that. Deal? 
Great, then let us begin. 
 A confident and convincing performance is the basis for every success. 
The ability to speak with enthusiasm belongs to the number one soft 
skills needed and is one of the most important career boosters there are. 
But unfortunately, the fear of speaking in front of other people is greater 
for some than the fear of death, or let’s say, many a person would rather 
die than deliver a speech. I know this from experience, because my fear, 
too, was so great that I couldn’t utter one proper syllable. That is a bad 
condition for a newscaster on the radio. Yes, you read that correctly. 
I was a newscaster and couldn’t utter a word. Nothing. Nada. Nichts. 
Well, to be perfectly honest, I could speak a bit, although that would 
sound like: New, niew, Nnnneewww New YYYo Yooo, YYYYorkkkk. 
Uhm, uuuhh, uhm cough, hem, sorry, again, Nnnnnew Yokkk, ehhm 
York. I didn’t quite reach the end of the first sentence, because the

anchor sitting behind the window in the radio studio quickly pushed up 
the controller for the music. I had half a mind to flee the city, preferably 
with a crash helmet on my head so nobody would recognize me. But do 
you know the actually fascinating and hopeful part of this story? Today 
I’m a professional voice-over artist and have completed numerous 
live-broadcasts in front of an audience of millions. I love the work as a 
voice-over artist. Every time, I feel fascinated and delighted that I can 
provoke emotions, seduce and amaze people simply by the sound of 
my voice. My trauma became a dream. “How is that possible?” …you 
might ask yourself, and the answer is very simple and contains the title 
of this book: Through Transformation. 
I transformed my fear of speaking into a joy for speaking. How I 
accomplished that and how you can turn your weaknesses into strengths 
as well, I will tell you now in detail. 
For a few years now, I’ve been coaching executives and entrepreneurs 
to help them achieve a confident and “coherent” appearance. For me, 
there is nothing more fulfilling than to watch my clients change for the 
better after they shed their fear of speaking. They grow more confident, 
their posture and attitude change, they begin to radiate and activate their 
true charisma, and they experience an inner joy that is contagious. And 
all the time they come closer and closer to their core, their vocation. I 
am convinced - and my experiences prove - that only after we overcome 
our fears, can we actually live out our true talents and passions. That 
should be an objective for all of us. That makes us happy. It is not the 
money, not the fame and prestige we enjoy (those are just side-effects), 
it is what we do with passion, full of joy and love, that fulfills us, and 
this always has to do with living out our talents. Fear keeps us from 
following our vocation and reaching our true goals. 
How then do we overcome the fear? I have developed a simple 5-Step 
Plan that has helped me bring about the transformation. This guide can 
also help with every feeling or situation you seek to change. 
1. Analyze it. What exactly is it that you fear? (For me back then it 
was the red light and the notion that once it turns on, every person “out 
there” would hear me). What is it that hinders you from unfolding your 
potential? Perhaps it’s just an uncomfortable feeling and you have been 
avoiding it for years. Why? Write down WHAT that is. 

249
HOW YOU TURN YOUR WEAKNESSES INTO STRENGTHS 
2. Accept it. That might seem wrong at first. But to change something, 
you first have to accept the situation as it is, and stop pretending 
everything was alright. No longer will we run from our problem, but face 
the challenge – this uncomfortable feeling, this shirking and avoiding, 
our bad conscience. Say, and write down: “Yes, I am afraid. Yes, I have 
always shirked to speak. I accept that. That is what was - and now I will 
change it.”
3. Audio-visualize it. This is a potent tool, the most potent to reach our 
goals. Imagine how you want the situation to be: In sound and visuals, 
like a living movie. Write down what your ideal situation would be, how 
you speak in front of a group of people, how you look them in the eyes, 
how they cheer for you excitedly. Let your imagination run wild, feel 
how you speak in front of others full of joy. What’s important: Phrase 
it positively and in present tense, as if the situation was happening right 
now. That is the number one trick for overcoming the fear of speaking, 
but also to achieve your highest goals. With this exercise I managed to 
turn my red light panic into joy. 
4. Activate it. Produce your movie. Become active and let your audio-
visualization become reality. Deal with the basic rules for a successful 
performance. Look for like-minded people, join a speaker’s club - I 
can recommend “Toastmasters International” - join a rhetoric course, 
let someone coach you, practice in front of the mirror. No matter what 
you do - Get into action and practice. When I did that, I shut myself 
in a training studio before going to work for weeks and simulated the 
emergency situation, until one day, I suddenly had “fun”. Wow! That’s 
a great feeling. You will experience that as well, so: Practice.
5. Archive it. Document your successes. Document them daily, and 
most importantly…in writing – both small and big improvements. That 
will give your self-confidence a boost, because you will realize what 
has improved and you will be an eyewitness to your own growth, your 
own transformation. We frequently mark on our walls how much our 
children have grown. It is always nice to see the surprise of the kids 
and how proud they are – when they see that they have grown several 
centimeters in only a few weeks. 

TRANSFORM
250
If you keep to this 5-step-plan, you will soon be unstoppable, you will 
speak and give presentations that convince and inspire others. You will 
overcome your fear, reach your goals and fulfill your dreams. 
I remember very well how I had just overcome my fear of speaking and 
of the microphone to become a really good newscaster, and how this 
improved my self-confidence drastically. It gave me the feeling of being 
unstoppable, and in a sense, I was. I finished my training as a radio 
editor and then worked as an editor-in-chief with a small TV station, 
later as a producer for bigger TV companies and as a creative director in 
my own production company. These things did fill my days, more often 
than not my nights as well, and they certainly filled my wallet. However, 
they did not “fulfill” me. I had the feeling that I wasn’t utilizing my 
talents and abilities properly. As a result, I decided to resign my secure 
post as a creative director and swap it against the insecure occupation 
of a freelance voice-over artist. Especially at the beginning, I had some 
months in which I would spend more money on advanced education, 
further training, books and classes, than I actually made with my voice-
over jobs. But I knew that it was the only way to really excel at it. It 
was an exhausting and difficult time of deprivation, without which I 
wouldn’t be the person I am today and I would hate to have missed it. 
I had prepared my exit quite well, increasing the marketing efforts for 
my voice-over services, acquiring studio equipment, and as a second 
mainstay founded a small video production company that was to deal 
only with content that was important to me. In the beginning I was off 
to a good start, but then came 9-11, the 11th September of 2001…the 
attack on the World Trade Center. 
In addition to the emotional and political confusion created by this 
unprecedented act of violence, many might also still remember the 
economic effects. Companies and television broadcasters put their 
marketing budgets on the back burner, afraid to invest, and just waited 
for what would happen next. The area of advertising in particular 
experienced a massive drop-off. The income I would have with my 
voice-over jobs on the side had dropped to less than 50 percent in 
full-time. I had one or other smaller documentary projects with my 
production company, but even those yielded too little to live and too 
much to die. H-m-m-m – what was I to do? To bury my dreams was 
out of the question. Soon I realized that I would have to decide whether 

251
HOW YOU TURN YOUR WEAKNESSES INTO STRENGTHS 
I wanted to be a voice-over artist or a producer for Christian spiritual 
videos. I opted for voice-over work with everything I had. While many 
colleagues complained about the recession, I researched the addresses of 
all local and regional radio broadcasters in Germany, printed postcards 
that outlined my services and introduced myself as the “new and fresh 
voice for your radio spot” with my own studio and live-broadcasting 
equipment. I then sent those postcards to suitable radio stations. Within 
one week, I was in business. Initial inquiries and jobs poured in, the 
clients were happy - and so was I! Some of the radio stations and spot 
producers who worked with me back then have remained in my client 
base to this day. In the “Yellow Pages” (that sounds kind of cute in the 
era of the Internet, doesn’t it?), I searched for recording studios and 
commercial productions in my area and sent CDs to them, containing 
convincing audio samples with a short introduction on the first track. 
Three days after sending them, I called to inquire whether or not the CD 
had been received and how they liked it. Trust me, every single phone 
call took an effort. Despite that, I held on to the golden rule: “Whatever 
you do, do it with all your heart and undivided attention.” (By the way, 
that’s a saying from my mother. Thanks Mom!)
I did not want to give up on my dream, despite having been about to do 
so sometimes. I don’t know how many phone calls actually yielded how 
many voice-over jobs, but I know that the number of interviews, casting 
invitations, price or project inquiries and actual jobs was growing, and 
that I was growing more confident with each phone call. Because the 
income from my voice-over jobs didn’t suffice and we were slowly using 
up the savings, I struck a “deal” with my wife Gesine in the meantime. 
The reason: We were expecting our first child, and in times of pregnancy 
and “nest-building”, most women are not exactly willing to compromise 
- nature has arranged it that way, I think. The result of our discussion 
was: If I couldn’t manage to feed the family on my freelance voice-over 
work within three months, I had to find a secure job. 
Thus, I had to increase my efforts yet again. At 8.30 in the morning I went 
into my little office with the adjacent vocal booth (one and a half square 
meters). At about 6.00 PM I came out again. When I was not sitting in the 
vocal booth filling an order, or speaking with another studio, I would sit 
at my desk to make sure I would sit in the vocal booth or another studio 
again as soon as possible – by specific, planned-out, thought-through and 
consistent means. More often than not, it was very laborious.

TRANSFORM
252
At that time, I got my hands on a CD. It was a live recording of an event 
in Germany, on which an American was speaking. Clearly, directly, 
easy-to-understand and stirring. The words that this man was shouting 
to me through the headphones of my CD Walkman, and that were 
always repeated by the simultaneous translation into German, shook 
me to the core. The speech stirred a part of myself that fascinated and 
motivated me. I listened to this CD again and again, wrote down the key 
sentences and acted upon them. The speaker used simple and powerful 
phrases like: “Write down everything you wish for…in detail! Make a 
plan out of them. Implement one thing each day. Any successful person 
plans and implements.” Who was that man who spoke to me? Brian 
Tracy! And I am glad and thankful today, at this moment to say, “Thank 
you, Brian Tracy, for this speech that has contributed so much to my 
success.” And that I may now contribute a chapter to Brian Tracy’s book 
Transform fills me with joy and gratitude.
The hard-earned money often went straight into acquisition again – 
among other things into an Internet performance with audio samples of 
various categories for download. But, a bit at a time, my efforts showed 
results. The jobs were pouring in and with them the income. I had to 
convince my wonderful wife to agree to extending our “deal’s” deadline 
by another two months to actually reach a break-even point, but because 
our financial situation had already improved so much, a real discussion 
wasn’t even required. The endurance had paid off – as it always does, 
by the way. 
And someday, the “miracle” happened. A big movie production inquired 
to have me narrate a 12-part TV documentary. The production manager 
had found my audio samples and had simply forwarded them to the TV 
channel’s editor. She liked the recordings and I had the job before I even 
knew what was happening. In the end, my efforts yielded results – and 
have done so to this day. This initial big television job spawned many 
more voice-over jobs in television. 
Today, I run a professional recording studio with a permanently-
employed sound engineer who records my voice for the various 
productions and who also runs the technical procedures for live 
broadcasts with studios all over the world. I also know that this success 
was not random, nor luck, but the result of hard work. 

253
HOW YOU TURN YOUR WEAKNESSES INTO STRENGTHS 
From my story, you can take six crucial points - which - as I’ve learned 
in several discussions with successful personalities - are quite universal. 
No matter what your occupation is, wherever you are standing right 
now. Whether you’ve been in your job for a long time, find yourself at 
a crossroads or are just starting out. These 6 points will help you to be 
successful, to unfold your talents and make your dreams come true with 
a passion. 
1. Decide on ONE thing that is really important to you - Something 
you are incredibly interested in.
2. Set a clear goal for yourself and keep moving towards it with 
passion and endurance. (Don’t worry. If your passion is great 
enough, the endurance will follow automatically.)
3. Never give up.
4. Experience the “miracle”.
5. Be happy and grateful. And the last point that I haven’t talked 
about yet:
6. Stay curious and keep learning each and every day. 
You cannot fail. 
I believe that at the end of our lives we will be asked what we have done 
with the talents that were given to us. Our answer shouldn’t be: “I buried 
them” but “I nurtured and cherished them and let them unfold to their 
full potential!” What will YOU say?

About Thomas
Thomas Friebe is one of the most successful voice-over 
artists in Germany. Millions of people know and are familiar 
with his voice. Whether it is a show, a documentary, sports 
or commentaries - you can hear him every day throughout 
different genres on various TV stations. He is the German voice 
for the hero “Desmond Miles” from the blockbuster game series Assassin’s Creed, 
the station voice for the national TV channels RTL Nitro and BibelTV, as well as the 
narrator for numerous audio books. His great success and his popularity stem from his 
distinctive, clear and sonorous voice and especially from his tremendous versatility 
and the precise attitude with which he breathes life into the texts and characters. 
After his journalistic training in radio, he switched to television and was at that time, 
the youngest TV editor-in-chief in Germany at only 22 years of age. After that, Thomas 
Friebe worked as an on-air producer for national TV stations (RTL Television, RTL2, 
VOX) and was the first German employee for the American TV station Nickelodeon in 
Germany. 
Together with his brother, he founded the TV production company “Tof Intermedia”. 
As the creative director and executive producer he has been responsible for several 
TV shows, campaigns, events and industrial films for notable international clients - 
many of which were award-winning productions. Since 2001, Thomas Friebe works 
full-time as a voice-over artist. His freshly-founded production company “Media 
Productions To Free” successfully runs a recording studio and produces videos for 
mobile and social media. 
Because Thomas Friebe suffered from fear of the microphone in the beginning of 
his career, he has been helping clients for a few years now to overcome their fear of 
speaking and to act with self-assurance. For this, he developed the digital program 
“In 5 Schritten zu einem sicheren Auftritt und mehr Selbstvertrauen” (“In 5 steps to 
a confident and self-assured appearance”), which has already helped many people. 
As an expert on convincing performance, Thomas Friebe also coaches executives and 
entrepreneurs. In doing so, there is nothing more exciting to him than to ferret out the 
often hidden talents of his clients and uncover these together with them, and nothing 
more fulfilling than to observe and share in this positive change. 
Thomas Friebe is convinced that a happy and fulfilled life can only be led by unfolding 
your own talents and using them to their fullest. To this message, he devotes all his

TRANSFORMING YOUR BUSINESS INTO A BLOCKBUSTER
CHAPTER 28
TRANSFORMING YOUR  
BUSINESS INTO A  
BLOCKBUSTER
BY NICK NANTON AND JW DICKS
The biggest thing is to let your voice  
be heard, let your story be heard.  
~ Dwyane Wade
When you tell your story in the right way, you can achieve a level of 
success that’s almost criminal.
Take Jordan Belfort for example. This super-salesman made $20,000 
by hawking Italian Ice from Styrofoam coolers in summers down at the 
beach when he was in college – but his ambition was to be a dentist. 
However, he quit the Baltimore College of Tooth Surgery on his first 
day, after the dean told the new class that if they wanted to make a lot of 
money, they were in the wrong place.
Instead, Belfort became a notorious stock swindler who made millions 
bilking small investors – and at one point employed 1000 people to help 
him do it. The Feds finally ended up catching up with all his scams, and 
he ended up being sentenced to 22 months in jail. The government also 
sold off all his assets to pay back the victims. 

TRANSFORM
258
End of story? No, actually just the beginning.
While in prison, Belfort met Tommy Chong, one-half of the hugely 
popular comedy duo Cheech and Chong. Chong was in jail for helping 
promote a business that sold drug paraphernalia over the Internet. When 
Belfort told Chong about all his insane adventures running his stock-
swindling company, Chong advised him to write a book about them. 
That advice turned to be a critical turning point. 
The finished book, The Wolf of Wall Street, became a huge bestseller. 
And you’re also probably aware that it was made into a lavishly-
produced movie hit directed by Hollywood legend, Martin Scorsese, 
with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the part of Belfort. The critically-
acclaimed film was nominated for 5 Oscars.
More importantly for Belfort, the celebrity status he gained from having 
his story told through the book and movie fueled a business comeback 
as a motivational speaker. That’s because, even though the book and 
film clearly showed his criminal activity, it also clearly showed his skill 
at sales, a skill many are willing to pay large sums of money to acquire.
And that’s why Belfort now earns tens of thousands of dollars for each 
speech and seminar that he’s hired to do – although he calls what he 
teaches: the art of “ethically persuading.” And we certainly hope he’s 
sticking to that “ethically” part.
STORIES: THE FOUNDATION OF SUCCESS
Belfort’s experience illustrates the power of stories, which has been 
heavily researched and validated (and is discussed at length in our 
StorySelling™ book). To summarize a couple of important points here, 
studies show that our brains love stories because they help us make 
sense of the world. Stories actually hit the pleasure centers of our minds 
– which causes us to often disregard the facts if they get in the way 
of a narrative we want to believe. Finally, we actually need stories – 
without them, we might not be able to make sense of our lives and 
how to approach them. We have a basic need to connect the dots of our 
existence, and the way we do that is through stories.
That’s why, as Belfort discovered, telling the right story in the right 
way in the right medium can take you to a level of business success you 

259
TRANSFORMING YOUR BUSINESS INTO A BLOCKBUSTER
might ordinarily think is out of reach. That’s the principle we’ve built 
our own business on – and we’ve practiced what we preach.
When we first opened the doors of our Celebrity Branding Agency®, one 
of the first things we knew we needed to do was write a book to explain 
who we were and what we did. That book became our very first best-
seller, Celebrity Branding You™ - but it wasn’t written for the purpose 
of being successful; it was written for the purpose of explaining what 
our Celebrity Branding techniques were all about and why they worked. 
Result? That book got us a lot of business and really sent us on our way.
Back in 2012, we realized it was time to write another book that would 
amplify the importance of exactly what we’re talking about in this 
chapter – telling your story in the most impactful way through movies, 
books and other media. That book, StorySelling™, happily became 
an even bigger success, rising to #4 on The Wall Street Journal’s non-
fiction list and to the #1 paid non-fiction book on the Amazon Kindle. 
Result? More people understood what we did at a deeper level – and 
were ready to do business with us. 
So – why a book? Couldn’t we explain these things to potential clients 
in person? Or over the phone? 
Well, yes, we could – but we still wouldn’t be able to cover the hundreds 
of pages of content in our books. You can only communicate so much in 
a conversation before you get tired of talking - or the person on the other 
side gets tired of listening to you!
But there was another bigger reason to present our ideas this way. Because 
our information was in a best-selling book, it ended up having much more 
weight and credibility than if it was just conveyed in a sales pitch. 
In a way, putting your message out through a book is really a big test: You 
have to really have something to say in order to pull one off, you just can’t 
fake your way through one. And anyone who read our latest book would 
discover a mountain of verifiable facts, proven strategies and high profile 
case studies that support what our agency offered our clients.
What it comes down to is this: What you do for your customers and 
clients involves your area of expertise, not theirs. And they may not 

TRANSFORM
260
necessarily understand what makes your specific professional process 
both different and more effective than your competitors’ – and why it 
will ultimately benefit them greatly to hire you or your company. 
A book is a managed, prestigious way to help them understand: It allows 
you to tell your story and present your unique selling proposition in a 
clear and powerful way. When done correctly, you not only explain the 
key to your success – you also explain why it could be the key to their 
success, in terms of what the product or service you’re selling can do 
for them.
But, as Jordan Belfort found out for himself, a book serves only as the 
foundation of your StorySelling™. To really attain a whole new level of 
success? You must build your business into a blockbuster.
GOING BEYOND BEING JUST ANOTHER BUSINESS
Here are a few book titles we’re sure many of you have heard of (if not 
read):
The One Minute Manager
Who Moved My Cheese?
The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
Eat that Frog!
The above were, of course, all highly influential business books that 
crystalized their authors’ philosophies in an easy-to-grasp concept (and, 
by the way, the last one happened to be co-authored by Brian Tracy, the 
legend whose name you’ll find on this book).
Now, because of the phenomenal success of these books, because of the 
way they resonated with their readers, the authors were able to build 
their personal consulting businesses into blockbusters. 
But they didn’t reach blockbuster status by simply publishing one 
book. No, they did it through media appearances, videos, in-person 
appearances and seminars, online marketing, and magazine and 
newspaper interviews. They continued the story laid out in their books 
into other media, just as Jordan Belfort continued his into a hit movie; 
they reinforced their essential narratives over and over and over until 
they owned a substantial segment of their audiences.

261
TRANSFORMING YOUR BUSINESS INTO A BLOCKBUSTER
This, of course, is nothing new. Walt Disney started his incredible 
entertainment empire by producing a short black-and-white cartoon 
featuring a talking mouse. He continued to expand his core brand story, 
first into animated features like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, then 
into live-action movies like Mary Poppins, and finally into theme park 
game-changers like Disneyland. 
But what if Uncle Walt had just continued to make cartoon shorts? 
Would he have ever been able to build the awesome multi-billion-dollar 
blockbuster business that still dominates the Hollywood arena today? 
Of course not.
Then consider Donald Trump, who not only has written many best-sellers, 
but has also had his own game show (Trump Card), reality show (The 
Apprentice) and has even hosted WrestleMania events! But even with 
all his different ventures, both in entertainment and business, he always 
preserves his basic story and persona – and carries it through in everything 
he does. You don’t confuse Donald Trump with anybody else, ever!
Building on your story and finding new and different ways to tell it 
is what truly transforms your business from a successful one into a 
legendary one. When you continue to deliver the same narrative across a 
broad range of venues and media, people remember that narrative – and 
you. You become your own version of Starbucks, McDonald’s or any 
other world-famous brand – and you become an instantly-recognized 
authority in your field, as well as the go-to person for your specialty.
What are the advantages of that? Well, there are at least three very big 
ones:
• You can charge more money for what you do.
When you enter the rarified atmosphere of a business blockbuster, you 
achieve a name and reputation that people are willing to pay top dollar 
for in order to gain access. Moguls like Donald Trump and Richard 
Branson make millions just lending their names to other people’s 
business ventures, just because everyone knows who they are and 
what they represent – and because it delivers a level of prestige that’s 
unmistakable.
• You will wield more influence.
When you achieve blockbuster status, people and organizations 
are more willing to listen to what you have to say, even if they’ve 

TRANSFORM
262
never done business with you. The right word from you can have an 
enormous impact on others’ dealings, which gives you more personal 
power out in the marketplace.
• You can dominate your field.
Apple is an obvious example of a blockbuster business. They’ve always 
had a consistent and dynamic sense of StorySelling that’s created not 
just customers, but disciples! The pay-off for that long-term vision has 
been a company that not only completely dominates their particular 
slice of the computer market, but also music distribution through 
their iTunes platform, as well as the cellphone industry through their 
phenomenally popular iPhone. Because they told such an incredible 
brand story, consumers were willing to follow them into whatever 
field they decided to diversity into. 
THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A BLOCKBUSTER
As you can see, being a blockbuster business delivers some awesome 
rewards. So – are you ready to kick your business up to blockbuster 
status? Here are a few pointers from us on how to do just that:
Building Block #1: Drill Down on Your Story
Before you start StorySelling, make sure you’ve got a narrative that 
will not only attract the kind of clients you want to attract, but also 
accurately reflects who you are and what you do. Making sure you have 
the right story in place before you aggressively StorySell is THE most 
important step you have to take. If you’re pretending to be something 
you’re not, it will catch up to you; that’s why, before you put a lot of 
time, effort and money into your StorySelling, you should make sure 
your story isn’t going to blow up in your face down the line.
We can return to Jordan Belfort for a good example of that. As we noted, 
he’s now selling himself as an ethical persuader – unfortunately, he’s 
recently been accused of hiding the money he’s making down under 
in Australia, so he doesn’t have to pay back the people he originally 
swindled! If that’s true, his new StorySelling attempts already have an 
unhappy ending. 
Building Block #2: Be a Person
It’s okay to show some of your warts in your StorySelling – as a matter 
of fact, it’s preferable. The more you can show you’re a human being, 

263
TRANSFORMING YOUR BUSINESS INTO A BLOCKBUSTER
flaws and all, the more relatable and the more memorable you are. 
Obviously, don’t take this to extremes, although it does work out for 
some people! 
Building Block #3: Be Unconventional
We quickly passed over an interesting item a little earlier in this chapter, 
so we’re going to repeat it here – Donald Trump hosted WrestleMania 
events! Now, that might be the last place you’d expect to see The 
Donald, sandwiched between two mammoth wrestlers getting ready to 
break chairs over each other’s heads - but the fact is, it does him some 
substantial good, from a StorySelling perspective. Think about it – his 
appearances at these matches (a) get Trump more attention, (b) expand 
his exposure to a whole different audience, and (c) actually kind of fits 
in with his aggressive brand!
The unconventional gets attention – and the more you do things that 
your competitors don’t do, the more you stand out. As long as it fits in 
with your narrative and you’re not doing something that will land you 
in jail, embrace the weird – and even post about it on Facebook and 
Twitter!
Building Block #4: Don’t Be Camera-Shy
If you’re like many people, you probably don’t like to look in the mirror 
more than you have to – but, unless your brand story is that you’re a 
recluse like Howard Hughes was, you’re going to have to get over the 
impulse to hide whenever anyone snaps a photo with their iPhone. A 
vital part of StorySelling involves showing yourself as much as possible 
— in films, online videos, the above-mentioned social media platforms, 
even on the cover of your book, so again, people can bond with you on 
a human level. The more potential clients feel like they know you, the 
more they will trust you and the more willing they will be to do business 
with you.
Building Block #5: Keep Your Core Value Front and Center
Most blockbuster brand stories can be boiled down to a couple of words 
that really define what they’re all about. Apple? Innovation. Disney? 
Family entertainment. Wal-Mart? Low prices. 
The word or words you use to define what you and your business are all 
about represent your core value, the thing that, when all is said and done, 
represents you the best. This quality should be present in everything you 

TRANSFORM
264
do from a StorySelling standpoint – because it’s what you want people 
to take away more than anything else. 
The great thing about creating a blockbuster business brand is that, once 
in place, it continues to generate its own success; people recognize it 
and reward it, often just because it is a known quantity. Of course, not 
every business can achieve blockbuster status – that’s why those who do 
are perceived as being incredibly special and unique.
You too can StorySell yourself to greatness if you take the steps to tell 
your tale in as many different high-profile media as possible. You may 
not become The Wolf of Wall Street – but you could become the Mogul 
of Main Street!

HOW TO TRANSFORM IN LIFE, BUSINESS AND HEALTH
CHAPTER 29
HOW TO  
TRANSFORM IN LIFE,  
BUSINESS AND HEALTH
BY DR. CARLO BIASUCCI
As is the case probably with most people in a health-related profession, 
I became a dentist because I wanted to help people. But I quickly 
discovered there was an incredible opportunity to do so much more in 
my field to impact the lives of others. Early in my career, I became 
heavily involved in studying cosmetic dentistry and offering these 
options to my patients. What I began to realize was that I was not just 
helping people, but I was literally a part of changing and transforming 
their lives. Seeing someone smile who previously hid their teeth and 
seeing the total personality change that ensues is very powerful. It 
seems to literally draw out their once hidden personality. It is a complete 
transformation in self-confidence, and it makes me feel very humble yet 
proud to be able to positively affect another person’s life in this manner. 
It is very apparent that the people who need the most dental work done are 
the same people that are absolutely terrified of dentistry. Recognizing this 
factor drove me to extensively study and offer to my patients conscious 
sedation, a process whereby the patient is awake but they really don’t 
care what is going on and in most cases they don’t remember much of the 
procedure. Conscious sedation has been a miracle for these people who 
were unable to have the treatment they needed due to their fear of dentistry, 
and now they beam with confidence from a beautiful, healthy smile. 

TRANSFORM
268
The icing on the cake for me is that often these anxious and fearful 
patients – once the bulk of their treatment is done under sedation – will 
overcome their fear and be able to attend for regular visits and even 
have minor dental work done without anxiety or fear. In my 10 years 
of practice, I have seen this scenario hundreds of times and each time I 
am reminded that we all have the power to effect positive change in the 
world and in each other. Very honestly, the transformations I am able 
to bring about in people is what drives me to continue doing what I do. 
Throughout the years I have also experienced transformation in my 
personal life and business. I have found that transformation is a process 
that brings about change. Change, just like creating a new, beautiful 
and healthy smile, can be influential in transforming multiple areas of 
our lives. It seems there is a systemic process that occurs in various 
facets of our lives almost simultaneously when transformation occurs. 
Based on my experience, there are certain contributing principles to 
transformation I would like to share with you. These principles have 
allowed me to create the personal and professional life that previously 
would have seemed out of reach.
A. Stay Positive
My core belief and strategy in life and business is staying positive and 
always looking for the positive in every situation. I think most people 
realize that in every situation you have a choice. You can find the 
negative or you can look for the positive. By looking at the positive, 
you will always find opportunities. I’ve used this concept as one of the 
main principles in my life to find opportunities to grow, and do a lot of 
things others are not doing or have tried doing only to give up. If you 
will reprogram your mindset to stay positive you will change your life. 
Positive people attract more positive people and the fire builds. On the 
other hand, negative people can quench that fire. If you are going to 
commit yourself to being positive, you will have to actively distance 
yourself from negative people who drain your energy. Your attitude 
and mindset will be an average of the people you associate with. This 
concept of staying positive will drastically impact your business and 
your health in a very productive way. 
If you have a positive mindset and you’re interpreting situations from 
that frame of mind, you will automatically lower your stress. If you 

269
HOW TO TRANSFORM IN LIFE, BUSINESS AND HEALTH
distance yourself from negative people and remove any negativity 
from your workplace, you automatically create a healthier overall 
environment. It is much easier to function effectively in a low stress, 
positive environment.
A positive person will look for the opportunity in every adverse situation, 
and in business there will be many. I have often said, “When everyone is 
running for the hills, stop and think.” Stop looking at and following what 
others are doing, unless you want to be like everyone else. If you want 
to do better or truly succeed, accept that the majority is wrong about 
their views, and move forward on the opportunity you have identified. 
Allow me to illustrate this point with my own experience building my 
dental practice. 
When I first opened my current practice in 2009, the economy was not 
the best – to say the least. A lot of people told me what I was doing 
could not be done. Opening a large, state of the art office in a smaller 
community with the economy taking a downturn was viewed by many 
as bad business planning. However, instead of listening to that, I stuck 
to my vision, stayed positive and really succeeded. I also aligned myself 
with mentors with a similar mindset. The business grew even in a down 
economy because of the drive to realize my vision to create an amazing 
team of positive, motivated individuals who exceeded the expectations 
of our patients. Had I listened to others, I would have delayed the 
opening of my office and would have missed the successes we have 
experienced, or at minimum, delayed my success. 
In my office, we (my entire staff) consistently portray a positive attitude 
and look at ourselves as friends helping friends. We strive to develop 
relationships and know each patient. Patients aren’t just numbers in our 
office. They are part of our dental home. We actively and purposefully 
engage our patients in personal conversation. In fact, the first ten 
minutes of a new patient visit is usually talking about them, their family, 
their likes and dislikes, what they do for a living, etc. We take time to 
get to know them and make it a personal experience before we start 
talking about their teeth. Everyone in the office engages each patient in 
conversation and we call them by name. They are not just a number to us. 
Focusing on relationships is critical in any business, but also increases 
your enjoyment of work in a day, further fueling your positive mindset. 

TRANSFORM
270
I built a state of the art practice because that was the opposite of what 
others were doing. I didn’t want to do what every other dental office 
was doing and get the same results. I’m a firm believer in, “If you don’t 
want the same results others are experiencing, then do not follow their 
lead.” Figure out what they are doing and then decide what you think is 
right for you. If you have no role model or other successful business to 
emulate, at least start by not following the majority. 
I also recommend getting unplugged from mass media and other time-
thieves like your email, random web surfing, and your cell phone. I 
rarely watch the news or read the paper. For the most part these are a 
series of doom-and-gloom messages. I’m not suggesting you become 
oblivious to the world around you. You should however pay close 
attention to messages you let in, because they will affect you and 
ultimately your success. You would be far better off using the time you 
save by unplugging a little to read a book that inspires you to be more 
successful in your life. 
B. Find a Mentor or Coach
I grew up in a business family in that almost everyone in my family runs 
a business. My father has operated a construction company my entire 
life. I grew up in that business, so I’ve seen firsthand his way of doing 
things, and he has been very successful. I also read a ‘book a month’ 
on leadership or something business related. I’m passionate about 
expanding my knowledge of business, customer service, and leadership 
as well as my chosen profession. I have found you can always learn 
something from anyone, whether it is from a conversation or a book, so 
keep an open mind. 
Finding a coach or mentor is extremely important to succeeding 
in business. I’ve always had someone to bounce ideas off of. It can 
potentially be anyone, but ideally they should be someone who has 
achieved the level of success that you desire – for certain, not someone 
who is status quo. What that does is drive you to fulfill your vision, and 
also helps you learn from what others have done to be successful rather 
than learning from trial and error. There is no purpose in reinventing the 
wheel. It will take you much, much longer to get to the level of success 
you desire by going it alone. 

271
HOW TO TRANSFORM IN LIFE, BUSINESS AND HEALTH
I look to my father who has been in business for many, many years, 
other successful dentists, and mastermind groups to fulfill that role. A 
mentor is anyone that can intelligently discuss with you in a helpful 
fashion your ideas, offer direction and hold you accountable. I believe 
by listening to the right people, I have achieved in five years what may 
have taken twenty-five years if I did it on my own. 
I have followed and studied successful people in various businesses, 
not just dentistry. I’ve pulled whatever I could from other industries 
that applied to my business in improving the patient experience, how I 
deliver services, how I market and how I can improve every aspect of 
my profession. 
C. Keep Your Life Balanced 
In the first three or four years after I opened my current practice, I really 
pushed into workaholic territory and didn’t take time to reenergize. 
Even for a younger person, in a very short time your health can go 
south pretty fast if you neglect to take care of yourself. Fortunately, 
I recognized that lack of balance and began to make changes before I 
caused further damage to health and other aspects of my life. 
In regard to overall health, many studies show the positive benefits of 30 
minutes of daily exercise combined with at least 7 hours of sleep every 
night. Additionally, eating properly will add to the overall balance in 
your life. Cut out the junk food (fast food, processed food, etc.) and feed 
your body natural foods that are rich in the nutrients your body needs to 
function properly. All these are factors that will keep your brain sharp 
and maximize your productivity. There are many excellent resources in 
this area. My favorite book on the subject currently is Grain Brain by 
Dr. David Perlmutter.
Giving the proper attention to your family life is also crucial to 
maintaining the balance you need to transform to the level of success you 
desire. A neglected family is not a happy family. If you allow things to 
decline at home, it will have a negative effect on you personally and will 
likely carry over into your business. Many entrepreneurs get wrapped 
up in their business quickly and easily and it doesn’t take long to lose 
focus. A balanced family life enables you to keep your stress level in 
check, and will make you a better person by keeping you focused on 
what really matters in life. It will also keep you focused on efficient uses 
of your time in your business so you can spend more time with family.

TRANSFORM
272
D. Keep True Friends
This goes back to my previous point about purposefully weeding out 
of your life individuals that bring negative energy into your life. True 
friends are individuals that will want the best for themselves as well as 
for you. They will be people that know how to maintain proper balance 
in their life and will share your positive perspective. Often these are also 
people that you will engage in conversation about your ideas and plans. 
True friends will be listeners, not just talkers. The bottom line is this, if 
someone does not have a positive impact on your life, they will likely 
hurt you in the long run. So choose your friends wisely. 
E. Laugh Daily
I find in the evenings, no matter how hectic the day has been, my wife 
is always able to make me laugh. She has a great personality and has a 
unique way to help me calm my mind and refocus on what is important. 
You have to have those types of people in your life to keep you grounded. 
There are many studied health effects of laughter and positive attitude. 
One can easily see the connection between being positive and being 
able to laugh. They just go hand in hand.
Success in business or in any area of our lives requires transformation. 
I have found these principles of: 
•	 Stay Positive 
•	 Find a Mentor or Coach
•	 Keep Your Life Balanced
•	 Keep True Friends and 
•	 Laugh Daily
…to be concepts that have literally transformed my life, my business 
and my health and I know they can do the same for you.

TRANSFORM YOUR ONLINE STRATEGY—SOCIAL MEDIA MYTHS AND MUST-DOS
CHAPTER 30
TRANSFORM YOUR  
ONLINE STRATEGY 
—SOCIAL MEDIA MYTHS  
AND MUST-DOS
BY LINDSAY DICKS
The evolution of social media has presented a sort of “good news/bad 
news” scenario for small businesspeople and entrepreneurs around the 
world. 
The good news is, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and the rest have provided 
us with all of these new and exciting possibilities for connecting with 
customers, forming relationships and building our brands. 
And the bad news? 
Well, when it comes to actually using social media, most of us still don’t 
exactly know what we’re doing. Sure, anyone can post a Facebook 
status, but very few of us understand exactly what we should and can 
be doing with social media to accomplish our goals. And with new 
platforms popping up every few months (Pinterest, anyone?), whatever 
we do master is almost certain to change in the near future. 
So how do we get the most out of the current social media trends, while 
developing a plan that will be easily adaptable to new platforms, new 
products and new audiences in the future? 

TRANSFORM
276
Let’s start by poking a few holes into conventional social media 
wisdom…
SOCIAL MEDIA MYTHS
Before you can fully grasp what to do with social media, it’s also 
important you know what not to do. Because social media is so new and, 
at the same time, so pervasive, there is a lot of misinformation out there 
about who it’s for, what it does and how it works. So let’s take a few 
moments to tackle some of the misinformation that may be holding your 
social media strategy back—or just pointing you in the wrong direction.
Myth #1: Social media is FREE (or at least extremely cheap!). 
It’s true, membership in sites like Facebook and Twitter won’t cost you 
a cent. But using them effectively takes time and expertise—time and 
expertise most of us just don’t have. Bringing in a paid expert may not 
be free, but it may very well be the best way to insure your social media 
presence receives the time and guidance necessary to succeed. 
Myth #2: Social media is EASY. 
We all know mastering the basic tools and broadcasting information 
on social media isn’t complicated–how else could all our grandmas be 
using it? However, the tools that may offer the most benefit to your 
business are a bit more complex than the ones granny uses–and more 
and more of them are appearing every day. Figuring out which of these 
tools will benefit your business and how to use them the most effectively 
for your particular niche takes time and patience you may not have, but 
a social media expert will get you going in no time flat.
Myth #3: Social media is just a fad.
Just like the Hula Hoop and Rubik’s Cube, many believe social media is 
just another craze that will soon die down. Well, the fact is, while fads 
may happen on social media (like flash mobs on Twitter), the platform 
itself is not going anywhere.
The Internet gives individuals and companies a place to freely exchange 
ideas and information with people down the block and around the world. 
That’s a complete paradigm shift just as newspapers, radio and television 
were in their time. Until something even more groundbreaking comes 
along that facilitates this in an even easier way, social media is here to 
stay and will only get bigger. Hang on to those antiquated beliefs that 

277
TRANSFORM YOUR ONLINE STRATEGY—SOCIAL MEDIA MYTHS AND MUST-DOS
social media will simply run its course and you’re asking to be left out 
of the most lucrative and growing market on the planet.
Myth #4: Social media is for kids.
If you’ve seen “The Social Network,” you’re no doubt aware that 
Facebook was launched by a college student. But are you aware that 
today, almost half of Facebook profiles belong to people aged 35 and 
up? Facebook is no longer just about “hanging out,” it’s about doing 
business–which is why adults with buying power are fast emerging as a 
powerful online target market. 
Myth #5: Facebook Ads are the best way to use social media 
marketing.
Mot of us are marketed to from the moment we wake up to the moment 
we go to bed at night. So we become immune to much advertising. The 
beauty of social media is that it offers a chance to reach people in a 
different way, because social media channels are fundamentally all about 
communication. So start by listening. Contribute to some conversations, 
and eventually start some of your own. Take time to build relationships 
and establish trust, then those people who have gotten to know and like 
you won’t view messages about your business as just another ad. And 
when you finally do advertise, keep it subtle and low-key.
Myth #6: Anyone can market successfully using social media.
As I’ve already pointed out, using social media in a business context is 
complicated and time consuming. To get the most out of it, you need 
to understand the tools available to you and your business, your target 
market, and what works and what doesn’t work when it comes to reaching 
them. You may not have the time or expertise for that, but a professional 
social media specialist (or team of specialists) will. Social media experts 
are uniquely suited to bring your existing branding message into the 
social media world; they’ll work closely with you or someone on your 
team to gain insight into your product or service offering, and combine 
that with their knowledge of the online landscape to give you and your 
company maximum online exposure. 
Myth #7: Social media marketing success can’t be measured.
Most people who worry that they can’t measure their social media 
marketing efforts also don’t know what to expect from social media 
marketing, so they don’t start out with clearly defined objectives. If you 

TRANSFORM
278
set concrete goals (things like increased traffic, sign-ups for a newsletter 
or other measurable activities), systems can be set up to accurately 
measure your progress. Define what success means first, then set up 
systems to determine how close you are getting to that definition. 
Myth #8: Social media is a world without rules. 
Entering a new social media platform is like entering a new culture; 
as the various platforms have evolved and become more sophisticated, 
each has developed its own system of etiquette and its own set of rules. 
Some basic rules, like not over-promoting yourself or your business and 
not attacking other people or groups, are common to most platforms. 
However, the diversity and constant change associated with social 
media means that each platform’s “unwritten rules” are different; they 
also tend to evolve and change. If you don’t know what these rules 
are, your best bet may be to team up with someone who does, to guide 
you through the initial phases and possibly give you valuable ongoing 
advice.
Myth #9: The more “friends” you add, the more successful you are.
Boasting a long list of Twitter followers is not a guarantee of business 
success. You need to look more closely at who those people actually 
are. They need to be people who are interested in your product and in a 
position to support your brand, not necessarily your nine year-old niece 
who’s posting a video of her piano recital on your wall! 
Focus on connecting with people who care about what you have to 
offer and with whom you can also form a clear communication channel. 
The sheer numbers of random strangers, family members and people 
you went to school with may look impressive, but when it comes to 
increasing business, the quality of your connections counts. Seeking out 
and engaging with the right kind of people takes skill and knowledge of 
consumer behavior.
SOCIAL MEDIA SUCCESS SECRETS
Okay, now that we’ve talked about what doesn’t work, let’s move on to 
the positive and what you can start focusing on TODAY to start elevating 
your social media efforts. Here are eight surefire ways you can utilize 
your social media presence to establish yourself (and your brand) as the 
go-to guru within your market.

279
TRANSFORM YOUR ONLINE STRATEGY—SOCIAL MEDIA MYTHS AND MUST-DOS
1. Tweet your analysis of breaking news in your field. 
Keeping your audience updated with all the latest breaking news 
in your industry helps keep them apprised of what’s going on. 
Providing your own thoughtful analysis of the story or event helps 
keep you at the top of your audience’s minds as an expert in your 
field. For example, if you are a tax lawyer, don’t just report that a 
new law is making its way through Congress…take the time to add 
your own, expert analysis of how the new law might affect your 
audience and what they can and/or should do about it. 
2. Post pictures on Facebook and Twitter of yourself “in action.” 
Anyone on my Facebook friend list knows that I get around. One 
day I’m at the Grammys, the next filming on location in Washington, 
D.C., the next riding a scooter in beautiful Bermuda. However, I 
don’t post those pictures simply because I like to share the fun of the 
places I get to see, but because, in most of those pictures, I’m also 
working hard helping my clients boost their celebrity status (I know, 
it’s a tough job, but somebody’s gotta do it!). Any opportunity you 
have to show yourself doing what you do makes your work seem 
that much more real and relatable to your clients and customers–so 
don’t be shy…post those pics! 
3. Post video tips on YouTube and then pin them on Pinterest.
Whatever you’re an expert at, take a moment to share what you know 
via a YouTube video and then pin that video on Pinterest! Video tips 
are a great way to connect with your audience–people feel closer to 
you when they can see and hear you, rather than simply reading your 
status updates or Twitter posts. If you produce these videos well, 
they act like your own personal commercials. You’ll be amazed at 
how much mileage you can get out of a collection of well-produced 
video tips. And you won’t just reap the branding benefits; you’ll also 
score with the search engines! 
4. Share your blog entries and articles across Facebook, Twitter, 
Google+ and LinkedIn. 
If you’ve been listening to me (and if not, why not?), you should be 
regularly publishing blog entries and articles. Now is your chance to 
let those blogs and articles do double-duty for you by posting them to 
your social media accounts. This not only drives traffic back to your 

TRANSFORM
280
website, it also reminds your audience of what an expert you are in 
your industry!
5. Answer questions your followers and connections may have. 
One of the best aspects of social media platforms like Facebook and 
Twitter is the fact that they allow you to interact with your audience 
in real time. When you pay attention to the conversations going 
on in cyberspace, chances are you’ll run across people who are 
asking questions or looking for advice. If they happen to be asking a 
question you know the answer to, chime in! You won’t just help the 
person who asked the question, but also everyone else out there who 
might have a similar question. And at the same time, you’ll be subtly 
demonstrating your expertise to your audience, reminding them that 
you are THE go-to person in your industry. 
6. Get personal… but not TOO personal. 
I like to think of the social media world as a giant cocktail party–a 
place to interact with interesting people, have fun, relax and tell 
jokes…all while networking and getting my brand out there. I firmly 
believe that social media doesn’t have to be all business, all the time. 
By letting my audience know what I’m up to—traveling, eating, 
shopping or just hanging out with my friends–I get to share a little 
piece of myself they can connect with that actually helps me build 
my brand. So don’t be afraid to be yourself and talk about your 
family, your pets, your hobbies and whatever makes you you. Just 
remember not to drop your guard too much when mixing business 
with pleasure (think classy cocktail party, not drunken fraternity 
bash)! 
7. Share actionable tips for your customers and prospects. 
There’s nothing wrong with sharing information with your audience, 
but sharing advice on how to do something is even better. In the 
business realm, we call this actionable content, and it’s incredibly 
powerful. Whether you’re a real estate broker sharing inexpensive 
ways to add value to your home, or an accountant providing a 
checklist of things to take care of before tax time, providing your 
audience with actionable, easily digestible tips is an ideal way to 
show that you really know your stuff. 

281
TRANSFORM YOUR ONLINE STRATEGY—SOCIAL MEDIA MYTHS AND MUST-DOS
8. Post valuable content from authoritative sources… and add 
your commentary. 
Have you ever seen a piece of content by a celebrity or fellow expert 
that struck you as something your audience might find valuable? 
Go ahead and share it. You don’t want to promote the competition, 
but posting content from big names in your field or related industry 
shows your audience that you’re “in the loop” and looking out for 
them. Add your own analysis and you’ll definitely cement that expert 
status in their minds.
The endless possibilities offered by the social media universe can be 
confusing–especially when it comes to using it to promote your business. 
But at the end of the day, the most important thing is to be able to say 
“Yes” to the crucial question, “Am I providing value to my audience?” 
If you aren’t working to give your audience information they can use, 
they’ll likely pass over your messages and focus on those that will 
make their lives easier. And even if you have a whole army of Twitter 
followers, it won’t do you much good if none of them are listening or 
looking forward to what you have to say. 
So remember, in the social media universe, it’s not all about you. Your 
goal should be to bring something to the table—to make them smile, 
to help them out, to keep them up to date on the latest news in your 
industry, and/or to shed light on new developments they might find 
scary or confusing. 
Act like the knowledgeable, helpful expert you are and your audience 
can’t help but pay attention to each and every interaction—and to turn 
to you as the true celebrity expert in your field.

STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION
CHAPTER 31
STRATEGIC  
TRANSFORMATION
BY DR. DEAN BANKS  
AND MARTY COATES
To go from where you are to where you want to be requires transformation. 
For some, it is a transformation of thoughts and ideas. For others, it 
can be a transformation of a company or organization to a new level 
of performance or accomplishment. For us, Dr. Dean Banks and Marty 
Coates, it was both.
We had no idea when our paths first crossed that we would find ourselves 
braving the corporate world together. In fact, our meeting was a chance 
encounter at a political function. We were both successful in our 
respective fields; Dean was a talented and business-savvy chiropractic 
physician, and Marty, a business consultant and professional speaker. 
Ours is a story of theory and practice colliding with opportunity and 
passion; of diverse experience engaging knowledge, attitude, and 
charisma. 
The combination of the two of us (along with a team of talented 
employees) resulted in the successful transformation of FirstChoice 
Healthcare, P.C., a small medical practice operating two locations, into 
a multi-disciplined, multi-location medical company positioned to make 
a significant impact in the world. Here’s the story.

TRANSFORM
284
When we met, Dr. Dean Banks had just built an impressive new facility, 
added a few physicians, and had gross sales of approximately $3 million 
annually. He planned to work hard and to make the business successful, 
so that over time he could work less, enjoy more time with his family, 
and enjoy the rewards of his success. 
What was not clear was how to arrive at the desired end. So he asked 
Marty to work with him to develop a strategic plan. Dean was motivated 
to attain his goals. He possessed a positive attitude that served as fuel 
for overcoming the obstacles that were certain to arise. He knew what 
he wanted. 
“If you are working on something really exciting, that you care about, 
you don’t need to be pushed, your vision pulls you.” ~ the late Steve 
Jobs, Founder and CEO of Apple. Dr. Banks did not necessarily need a 
push, but a guide, coach or chauffeur. He was convinced that together 
with Marty, he could accomplish his desired end-state. Marty knew that 
if he could help Dean strategically align his vision with the right people 
and the right plan, Dean would realize his goal. 
Marty began the process of helping Dean to refine his mission, clarify 
his corporate vision and establish a set of organizational values. They 
then got his team involved in developing other key components of this 
plan. 
At this point, the weight of the company and its future was sitting upon 
the shoulders of Dean and a few key staff members. He was handling 
much of the day-to-day operations and still treating a few of his own 
patients. The new building, as well as an under-performing remote clinic 
location was placing a strain on our financial position. The company 
was carrying a few hundred thousand dollars each month to cover 
operations. Investments continued to perform, but Dean was itching to 
grow the company. What he needed to do was back away from patient 
care and management functions, and focus on accomplishing his vision. 
In this new relationship with Marty, Dean’s role could change. He could 
become more visionary, less involved in the day-to-day operations, and 
Marty could play a more pragmatic role, seeking to plan each move or 
at least pause to consider the steps. Dean’s entrepreneurial spirit, his 
in-depth knowledge of medical operations and his openness to taking 
business risks were vital to making the transformation.

285
STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION
How would we merge the talents and strengths of each of us and devise a 
path forward? If we were to transform this small company to a medium-
size corporation within a prescribed number of years, we would have 
to do so systematically. We began by analyzing every aspect of the 
company- its people, problems, processes, and priorities. Marty led the 
group through a stringent SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities 
and Threats) Analysis. We surveyed our staff and customers, researched 
our markets and customer profiles, and reviewed the finances for 
immediate ways to cut costs to generate additional capital for growth. 
We renegotiated with our vendors for preferred rates and better terms. 
We bid out our banking operations, which resulted in us making a 
change in our banking relationship and significant savings. 
Over the course of the next seven years, we transformed the company. 
Marty came on board as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), but continued 
to serve in a consulting role. We grew from two offices to seven, 
expanding into new disciplines discovering a couple of niche areas 
that became fundamental to the transformation. We made adjustments 
to services based on market shifts. This all happened during one 
of the worst economic recessions in modern history. While many 
medical professionals were going out of business or merging with 
larger companies, FirstChoice stayed on plan. Dramatic changes in 
government reimbursement for healthcare, followed by third party 
insurance companies reducing reimbursement, did not negatively 
impact our growth. Dean had the vision to expand ancillary services 
that complimented our basic services. We remained open and flexible to 
the opportunities as they appeared.
There were a number of principles that were central to our transformation. 
In every turn along our journey, Dean Banks made sure we practiced 
each of them.
We call them Dean’s Theories of Success.
1) Be disciplined in your work and practices.
2) Hire the right people, train them, pay them well and expect them to 
perform. Ensure you have technically competent people. (Degrees 
are less important than what one knows.)

TRANSFORM
286
3) Always be open to trying new things. “Innovation is the mother of 
invention,” someone once said.
4) Be willing to make tough decisions. The right decision is often 
times the most difficult one. 
5) Do not be afraid to take risks. Grab opportunity, succeed or fail, but 
don’t look back, your future is ahead of you.
A boat is safe in the harbor, but that is not what a boat is built for.  
~ Anonymous.
6) Be confident and consistent in your practices, actions and 
instructions.
7) Give people room to explore their own capabilities. Give directions 
and get out of the way. “Let me know how that works out for you,” 
Dean would say when a team member proposed a new idea. In other 
words, you give it a try.
Here’s an outline and diagram of our strategic process. Consider how 
you may apply this transformation effort in your organization, or 
similarly, in your life.
OUR STRATEGIC PROCESS
Dr. Stephen Covey, author of the book Seven Habits of Highly Effective 
People said, “Begin with the end in mind.”
Vision — What is your picture of the organization at some point in the 
future (3, 5, 7 years)? This picture should be seen and stated as if you are 
already there. Visualize it this way. You are at Pinehurst Country Club, 
Course #2, standing on the tee box of Hole #1. From the tee box you can 
see the flag on the green in the distance. You know where you want to 
hit the ball onto the green. You have an end vision. See your company 
as you desire it.
Mission — What is your purpose? Why are you in the business you 
are in? When properly stated, a personal or organizational mission 
should define the “why” and the “what” but not the “where.” Mission 
is foundational, usually answering a need or call, providing a product 
or service. Your corporate or personal mission does not propel you 
forward, instead it holds you up.

287
STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION
Key Business Drivers (KBD) — What key indicators will you use to 
gauge your progress toward your goals and vision? You should create a 
list of questions to be superimposed over the organizational activity at 
any time. For example, “Do we have the right people on the bus?” “Do 
we have enough money in the bank to cover our expenses?”
Critical Success Factors (CSF) — What issues, external to your 
organization and outside of your control, can you identify that might 
impact your ability to accomplish your vision? In most cases, we cannot 
stop these from happening, but we may be able to influence how they 
impact us. By attempting to identify CSF’s and preparing contingency 
plans in the event they arise, we position our organization to weather most 
challenges. For example, we might identify governmental regulations as 
a CSF. How do you prepare? How will you respond?
Goals — What are your long-term objectives or targets, usually marked 
to be accomplished between 3 to 5 years, depending on the span of 
the vision. These are more specific and measureable than the vision, 
but less specific than the strategic objectives that follow. Goals must be 
developed by using what’s called the SMART TEST. The variables of 
the test are listed below:
Smart Test —
•	 Specific
•	 Measurable
•	 Attainable
•	 Realistic
•	 Time-bound
Strategic Objectives — As you accomplish strategic objectives, the 
picture of your goals becomes clearer. These mid-range targets must 
be accomplished in order for you to reach your goals. In most cases, 
strategic objectives are targets about 1 to 3 years out. 
Actions — These are near-term tasks that must be accomplished in order 
to reach your strategic objectives. Taking shortcuts here will cost you 
later. Normally, actions are required to be completed within 12 months.
Values — These are our right and left out-of-bound markers. They keep 
our actions in check. If we move too far right or too far left, our Values 

TRANSFORM
288
bring us back into alignment or help us to realize we have moved away 
from our core plan. Each organization should prepare its own list of core 
Values, which best describe its intended internal compass. 
The diagram below is a visual representation of the way the strategic 
process that we followed should flow:
Figure 1.
The strategic process is critical and necessary in order to accomplish 
transformation. More plainly stated, there are nine key actions that an 
organization must take to accomplish its vision. 
NINE KEYS TO STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION
1.	Clearly state your vision
2.	Institutionalize your corporate mission
3.	Set actionable goals, strategic objectives and near-term actions
4.	Communicate clearly your corporate Values
5.	Measure progress along the way
6.	Hold your team accountable
7.	Be flexible and adapt to changes in the plan

289
STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION
8.	Revisit your plan periodically
9.	Celebrate your accomplishments with the team
Oh yeah, what is the rest of this story? Well, Marty moved on about a 
year ago to make way for a transitional leader to help drive the final leg 
of the journey. Dean, with new leadership in place, went on to achieve 
everything he desired in the original strategic plan, and just a few months 
ago he sold his company for a sum greater than even he imagined. Is this 
story about the successful transformation of Dean’s business or about 
making a lot of money? I think Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, said it best 
when he said, “Chase the vision, not the money.” The money will come 
if your motivation is right and your plan is aligned properly with the 
vision.
Today Marty and Dean continue working together on other projects 
through a corporation they formed many years ago, WayMaker Learning 
Corporation(WLC). Moving forward, their energies – through WLC – 
will be focused on helping other individuals and companies grow and 
accomplish their visions. Both are convinced that deliberately crafting 
a strategic plan was crucial to the move from a small player in an 
even smaller market to a large regional medical corporation including 
seven locations, a highly complex laboratory facility and nearly 100 
employees. Dean also fulfilled his dream by working a bit less and now 
enjoys life at a higher level with his family. 
You can accomplish this kind of transformation in your own life and/or 
business by applying the simple yet useful tools we have discussed in 
this chapter. What is critical now is one thing that Dean has maintained 
from the start…you have to START! Take action to team up with a 
coach, a mentor, a seasoned consultant or trusted friend, and design a 
strategic plan forward. Then start moving toward the vision you have 
for your life or organization.
The accomplishment of the transformation of FirstChoice Healthcare, 
P.C., was far more than a small company becoming larger. We transformed 
a marketplace and dispelled the notion that an organization’s vision can’t 
be accomplished. It can, and Dean Banks and FirstChoice Healthcare, 
P.C., headquartered in sleepy little South Carolina are proof.

ARE CEOS AND BUSINESS EXPERTS HELPING OR HURTING U.S. COMPANIES?
CHAPTER 32
ARE CEOS AND BUSINESS 
EXPERTS HELPING OR  
HURTING U.S. COMPANIES?
BY MACODOU N’DAW, CFA
Globalization, free trade agreements, and the advent of the Internet 
have created a world market with no boundaries. We now witness an 
easier movement of goods and services, a quick and instant transfer of 
funds, and a worldwide and better communication system. An easier 
gathering and quick dissemination of data has also greatly improved 
market intelligence.
Furthermore, country borders are becoming artificial because of the 
establishment of economic communities. We have, just to name a 
few, the European Union (EU), the Association of South East Nations 
(ASEAN), the Andean Community of Nations (CAN), and the Southern 
Africa Development Community (SADC).
This state of affairs has made access to any market quicker and easier, 
but also has made competition much stiffer. U.S. companies which 
must, but are reluctant to explore new markets, will see competition 
brought to their own local or national markets. Therefore, international 
expansion might be a smart way to protect one’s own market. To repeat 
an old adage: the best defense is offense.
The old ways of doing business are no longer appropriate. Production 
parameters and particularly marketing strategies have drastically 
changed. This will continue to be so, and at a faster rate because when 

TRANSFORM
294
technology is a dominant part of the new economy, obsolescence and 
innovation become the norm. Change becomes the only constant. Those 
companies that embrace change and develop their business strategy 
accordingly will be ahead of the competition, and those that don’t, will 
at best, survive, and at worst, disappear.
It should be common business sense to, at least, study the feasibility 
of expanding internationally when 96% of the world’s consumers and 
almost 2/3 of the world’s purchasing power live overseas.1
Therefore, shouldn’t CEOs and business advisers be cognizant of these 
new developments? Unfortunately, many CEOs think they have a good 
product and that the U.S. market is safer and “if it ain’t broken, don’t 
fix it.” I have also come across many business experts who are still 
providing advice based on antiquated business assumptions.
A NON-OPTIMAL USE OF BUSINESS MODELS
Many U.S. companies are not going overseas because the CEOs only see 
challenges, not opportunities. They are not aware of the many programs 
that provide assistance for going overseas.
Unfortunately, many of the business experts who advise them are also 
not aware of these programs. And because they are not familiar with 
these resources, their analyses and recommendations are still done as if 
we were still in the pre-globalization, pre-new economy environments.
To illustrate, let’s look at the use of the SWOT2 matrix. I could have 
used any other model but chose the SWOT model instead because it 
is favored by business analysts. Used properly, it can give you a lot 
of useful insights on the issues and challenges facing a company, and 
consequently, what recommendations to give. But, if the assumptions 
used do not take into consideration the new environment in which we 
live now, the conclusions reached will be faulty, and more importantly, 
can be harmful to the company. 
For example “strengths” and “opportunities” can be grossly overestimated 
if the analysis fails to incorporate international competition. For the same 
reason, “weaknesses” and “threats” can be underestimated. Therefore, 
the SWOT analysis might show a strong company while more relevant 
1. sba.gov
2. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

295
ARE CEOS AND BUSINESS EXPERTS HELPING OR HURTING U.S. COMPANIES?
assumptions would have resulted in showing a much weaker company 
being advised.
THE CASE FOR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
It is no longer enough for a company to be cognizant of external trends 
in its industry. It should also be willing and able to integrate those trends 
in its corporate strategy. If a company is operating in a global industry 
and is not expanding outside of the U.S., chances are that a foreign 
company will be coming in to its backyard, likely erode its market share, 
and possibly put it out of business. 
Six (6) of the ten (10) biggest Argentine agri-business companies went 
bankrupt in the 2000s when Chinese companies entered the Argentine 
market. They limited their competitive analyses to the national market, 
hence did not see the threats coming from China. Also, according to 
the Financial Times (FT), almost 50% of companies (238) listed in the 
FT500 in 1999 were no longer on the list in 2009.
Beyond survival, expanding internationally is also a good tool for 
recruiting high-caliber staff. Young professionals are now more 
interested to work for a company with an international presence because 
they can acquire greater skills and cross-cultural experiences. Going 
international also allows a company to have access to an international 
talent pool.
CHALLENGES IN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Although expanding into a foreign market is no longer reserved for only 
big companies, it is not easy. Emerging markets have more differences 
than similarities. Neighboring countries in the same region are at a very 
different stage of development, face different economic challenges, and 
consequently are looking for different solutions. Many companies trying 
to expand overseas have made the mistake of analyzing two countries 
in the same way.
However, expanding internationally does present great opportunities 
when a company knows how to manage the risks and make use of programs 
especially designed to help enter foreign markets. Unfortunately, these 
programs discussed below are often unknown to many domestic CEOs 
and business experts. 

TRANSFORM
296
Some of the main challenges usually faced by a company entering a 
foreign market are listed below.
A. Culture and Business Practices
Obtaining permits, licenses or customs clearances can be quite frustrating 
and time-consuming. Also, in many regions, especially Asia, deals are 
concluded mostly based on personal relationships and a congruent long-
term vision. These two factors precede the potential benefits that might 
result from a deal. In many countries, “time is not of the essence” in 
forging business relationships, as opposed to the U.S., where people 
consider that “time is money.” 
Business practices also differ from country to country. For example, 
when we advised a U.S.-based cellular company, we had to readjust 
revenues because in many developing countries, the practice of billing 
for incoming calls is not accepted by customers—the rationale being 
they should not pay for a call they did not initiate. 
Hiring local managers will help navigate through bureaucratic red 
tape. They can also advise on how to conduct business negotiations. 
Hiring U.S. trained professionals who fully understand the U.S. culture 
and have returned to their native countries is also an effective way of 
addressing these challenges.
B. Marketing
When I tell business owners that they are not in the telecommunication, 
or manufacturing, or mining business, but in the marketing business, 
they are startled. Many business owners are in love with their products 
and services and still think that “if you build it, they will come.”
Customers must be able to find a company quickly, at home and abroad, 
when they search for its product or services category. It does not do a 
company any good if it has the best products or services but no one can 
find it. 
Therefore, a good social media marketing strategy and a marketing 
website, not a static website, are required for good search engine 
optimization (SEO).
Also, the company should learn the marketing channels that are effective 

297
ARE CEOS AND BUSINESS EXPERTS HELPING OR HURTING U.S. COMPANIES?
in a given country and not embark on a “one size fits all” marketing 
strategy.
C. Financial, Economic and Environmental Results
It is no longer sufficient for a project to be just financially viable. 
Economic viability and sustainability have also become integral parts 
of the decision-making process. Consequently, they are determining 
whether a project receives the green light from administrative authorities 
to proceed, or get funding from financial institutions.
Furthermore, consumers are increasingly demanding sustainable 
products and advocate groups are better organized and more vocal. They 
hurt a company’s image when they demonstrate against its policies and 
production systems or wage a boycott campaign.
This is why many financial institutions have come to adopt what is 
called the “triple bottom line” requirement, i.e., projects have to meet 
the financial, economic, and environmental tests before they fund them. 
EXPORTING AS A FIRST STEP
The U.S. lags behind other economic powers when it comes to exporting. 
According to the World Bank3, U.S. exports in 2012 accounted for only 
14% of gross domestic product (GDP), as compared to Germany (52%), 
Spain (33%), United Kingdom (32%), Italy (30%), and France and 
China (27%).
U.S. Companies that are lukewarm to expanding overseas can start the 
process by just selling their products and services. Thus, they can test 
the market, have a better understanding of the cultural challenges, and 
consequently decide whether to establish a physical presence or not. 
Also, exporting to developing countries as a first step might be less 
challenging than trying to enter a developed market. Chinese companies 
have adopted this strategy in Africa, the Middle-East, and in Latin 
America. This can be done through strategic alliances or joint-ventures.

WHERE TO OBTAIN ASSISTANCE  
TO ENTER FOREIGN MARKETS?
We discussed earlier some of the challenges in expanding overseas. The 
good news is that there are many programs whose sole purpose is to 
alleviate, if not eliminate, most of these challenges.
Below are some of the organizations and agencies that can make an 
entry to a foreign market a lot smoother: 
US Agencies
The U.S. Commerce Department 
Provides a program called Gold Key Services. “It offers customized 
market and industry briefings; timely and relevant market research; 
appointments with prospective trade partners; help with travel, 
accommodations, interpreter service, and clerical support.”4
www.commerce.gov
The Small Business Administration 
“Many small businesses think they are too small to compete in the world 
market. In fact, 97% of all exporters are small businesses. The federal 
government has loans, insurance and grant programs to help a company 
become an exporter or expand its exporting business.”5
www.sba.gov
Business.USA.gov 
Contains a wide range of resources to help small businesses begin and 
expand into exporting.
State Trade and Export Promotion (STEP) 
This grant program is an export initiative to make matching-fund grants 
for states to assist “eligible small business concerns.”6

CHAPTER 33
HOW TO AVOID THE  
DOUBLE-TAX TRAP  
AND RECEIVE  
TAX-FREE MONEY
BY STAN JACKSON
A few years ago, a sophisticated lady (let’s call her Jane), sat in my office 
telling me how she had lost over $500,000 in the market within just a 
few months. Too many investors feel like Jane, as though they are at a 
Vegas roulette table. They possess a feeble hope that their investments 
will not lose money! 
The majority of financial advisors offer products with risk. Why do 
most financial products have a prospectus? A prospectus describes risk. 
A safe, financial instrument with guarantees does not need a prospectus. 
The prospectus does not describe safety and guarantees, instead it 
reveals the uncertainty of the investment. 
When clients are losing money in the market, most financial advisors 
chant the mantra, “In time your investment will come back!” If we look 
at history, the Japanese Nikkei 225 hit its all-time high on December 
29, 1989, before closing at 38,915.87 having grown six fold during the 
decade. Subsequently, it lost nearly all these gains, closing at 7,054.98 
on March 10, 2009—81.9% below its peak twenty years earlier. It has 
been over 24 years, and the Nikkei still has not returned to the heights 
of 1989.

Some financial skeptics might propose that the US market has always 
done better than overseas markets. How long did it take to recover from 
the market crash of 1929? The year of recovery was 1954, 25 years later. 
One of the greatest fears of retirees is outliving their money. If they leave 
their money in the stock market, they face the risk of substantial losses. 
If they place their money in CD’s, retirees risk losing their investment 
due to the effects of inflation and taxes. One of the key foundations for 
wealth preservation is to protect your investment. Never take a loss is 
the investment philosophy of the sage, investor Warren Buffett. He said, 
“The first secret is, don’t ever lose.” 
Let’s review three financial strategies that will help investors navigate 
through financial landmines.
FIRST, THERE ARE THE NON-TAXABLE  
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. 
The top tax rate in this country is 39.6% and the average top tax rate 
since 1913 is 69%. Most economists believe that we will see much 
higher taxes in the future. Given these facts, tax-free income strategies 
may be ideal for retirement planning.
Most investors diversify their investment portfolio, but often they 
fail to diversify into non-taxable accounts within their investments. 
We believe that an investor should enhance their portfolios with non-
taxable accounts before and during retirement. This gives the investor 
more spendable money, as the monies that would have otherwise been 
submitted as tax, stays right where it belongs – with the investor. 
The following are three non-taxable incomes strategies: 
1.	Roth IRAs/401(k)s
2.	Municipal Bonds
3.	Life Insurance
One possible solution for non-taxable money is to convert your 
IRAs/401(k)s to Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s. Roth IRAs/401(k)s greatest 
benefit are that the monies, if held properly, go to the client tax-free. 
However, a lot of clients don’t qualify, because they make too much 
money. Roth IRA’s also have limits on what you can contribute each year. 

305
HOW TO AVOID THE DOUBLE-TAX TRAP AND RECEIVE TAX-FREE MONEY
The conversion amount is taxable. The high cost of this conversion is 
usually too expensive for most taxpayers.
Municipal Bonds are exempted from federal taxes. In some cases they 
are exempted from state income taxes. However, they are becoming 
more and more risky due to the fiscal problems of many municipalities. 
They can also trigger taxation of your Social Security benefits.
Life insurance is an overlooked option. The story of Goldilocks and 
the Three Bears helps us understand the different types of permanent 
life insurance policies. The first porridge was too hot; the Variable Life 
offers growth, but is risky for retirees as there is typically no downside 
protection. The second porridge was too cold; the Fixed Universal 
Life and Whole Life products offer safety but normally have high cost 
structures and low growth potential. The last porridge was just right; the 
Indexed Universal Life product offers growth tied to market gains with 
lower costs of insurance, low fee structures and downside protection – 
safety – all tax-free, if designed properly.
If you could come up with the ideal investment product, what features 
would it have? 
1. You can take money in your retirement tax-free.
2. You can receive market returns without the risk of principal losses.
3. You can access your money at any age.
4. You can continue making contributions, even if disabled.
5. You can provide a tax-free lump sum for your family, if you die 
prematurely. 
6. You are protected from judgments and lawsuits in many states. 
7. Does not create taxation of Social Security benefits. 
Indexed Universal Life is an ideal financial instrument with the benefits 
described above. Many Social Security recipients are shocked to realize 
that up to 85% of benefits are taxed. If they take out more money from 
their traditional IRA, more of their Social Security benefits are taxed. 
You could have more money during your retirement, if you combine 
your Social Security benefits with an Index Universal Life insurance 
policy. “It’s not how much income you have, but how much you have to 
spend.” - Doug Warren

Are you interested in having a tax-free income during your retirement as 
well as a financial plan for your loved ones after you pass way? Indexed 
universal life insurance is a vehicle with cash value that can earn inter-
est based on a fixed, pre-determined interest rate. You can earn interest 
rates based on an equity or bond index, like the S&P 500, which histori-
cally has earned a higher interest over time. This coverage has benefits 
that you can use – tax-free – while you’re alive. It has a death benefit 
that passes to your loved ones tax-free when you pass away.
In the event of a financial need, be it business or personal, the money 
in your tax-deferred cash value accumulation account can be accessed 
through the tax-free loans. Better yet, the value of the amount you have 
borrowed can continue to participate in the market gains that your cash 
value account accumulates with compound interest. 
Your money is paid to you in the form of tax-free loans against your 
account value at retirement. This money could be a lifetime income 
stream with no risk of principal loss. In fact, most Indexed Universal 
Life Insurance products have minimum guaranteed returns!

307
HOW TO AVOID THE DOUBLE-TAX TRAP AND RECEIVE TAX-FREE MONEY
THE SECOND FINANCIAL STRATEGY IS AN IRA RESCUE 
Because taxes have not been paid on retirement account funds, this 
could be your tax-time bomb. IRA’s or qualified plan funds that are 
unneeded to maintain your lifestyle can use the IRA Rescue Strategy 
to dramatically amplify the legacy that is passed on to loved ones. 
With 90 percent of IRA accounts being cashed in at the death of the 
second spouse, you run the risk of making the IRS one of your prime 
beneficiaries.
This model is to use a quality Indexed Universal Life policy that will 
provide tax-free income. The Index Universal Life Insurance concept 
is that the policy takes advantage of the IRS tax code section 7702 and 
72(e). These sections state that the cash value inside a life insurance 
policy grows tax- deferred and can be withdrawn tax-free.
One of the biggest questions about this strategy is what happens, if the 
tax law changes? In the early 1980’s, Single Premium Universal Life 
policies could take unlimited amount of money into these policies. 
These benefits were so good that the government changed the law. No 
longer can unrestricted dollars go into these policies. 
I introduced my father and my mother to these tax-favored instruments, 
from which they reaped these benefits for about 25 years. Dad and Mom 
and all other policies holders still maintained all the original benefits, 
even after the law changed. The reason they kept the benefits is that the 
old law was grandfathered. When there are significant tax changes, the 
government normally grandfather’s the old law. 
The IRA Rescue strategy will allow you to take non-recourse loans from 
your policy to pay the tax. IRA/401(k) money cannot be transferred 
directly into life insurance products. The funds must first be withdrawn 
from the IRA/401(k), become subject to tax, then the life insurance 
policy can be purchased and tax deferred accumulation can begin. 
Any withdrawal from a qualified plan will be taxed, whereas most 
withdrawals from an Indexed Universal Life product can be taken tax-
free.
In this plan, the taxes are due on each distribution. The amount needed 
to pay the taxes is borrowed from the policy. This will not disturb the 
earning power of the original principal.   If properly structured, the 

TRANSFORM
308
money borrowed is from a side fund of the insurance company not the 
client’s money. This loan will accrue with interest in the policy. It does 
not have to be repaid until you pass on. The insurance company will 
deduct the loan balance from your death benefit before they send your 
beneficiary the remaining tax-free death benefit. 
Depending on your allocations, the cash value account in the policy can 
grow at a better than market rate and policy loans - even annual loans - 
used as income are tax-free. With this strategy you are converting your 
taxable IRA or 401(k) to a tax-free cash value life insurance policy with 
a tax-free death benefit. You then can borrow against the death benefit 
to offset the conversion tax. You can minimize the death benefit to keep 
the cost of insurance low and maximize the cash build up in the life 
insurance policy.  Sound too good to be true? It’s not, we are simply 
leveraging the tax-benefits of a life insurance policy for maximum tax-
free income.
The cash value account in the policy grows at a better than market rate. 
The policy loans can be used as income and are tax-free. With this 
strategy you are converting your taxable IRA or 401(k) to a tax-free 
cash value life insurance policy with a tax-free death benefit. You then 
can borrowing against the death benefit to pay the conversion tax. You 
minimize the death benefit and maximize the cash build up in the life 
insurance policy.  You are utilizing the tax-benefits of a life insurance 
policy for maximum tax-free income.
For example, a male, age 55, has an IRA valued at $500,000. His number 
one concern is safety from market losses. He wants his investment to 
earn a reasonable rate of return. He also wants to “lock in the gains” 
when credited, all on a tax-advantaged basis. 
In this example, 15 years later, when he is 70, this client can receive a 
tax-free income in the amount of over $108,000 per year – all without 
raising his tax bracket!   He also wants to “lock in the gains” when 
credited, all on a tax-advantaged basis of over $108,000 per year.  That 
is a taxable equivalent yield of over $155,000 per year!  This allows the 
client to receive an income for 20 years of $2,160,000, tax-free! In the 
20th year, the death benefit is still $400,000.  

309
HOW TO AVOID THE DOUBLE-TAX TRAP AND RECEIVE TAX-FREE MONEY
THE THIRD FINANCIAL STRATEGY IS TO SOLVE THE 
DOUBLE-TAX TRAP
What is this double-tax trap? Some financial advisors have called it the 
75% tax trap. Clients with large estates, who have money in IRAs and/
or qualified plans may qualify for these double-taxes.  You can nearly 
always guarantee that such clients will have that money double-taxed 
at their death. Many people over the age of 60 have accumulated large 
sums in qualified retirement accounts or deferred annuities that may 
not be needed to fund their retirement. Their intent may well be to 
defer taxes and pass the account to their future generation. They end up 
passing most of their gains to their least favorite relative – Uncle Sam! 
Take a client with a large estate and a $3 million IRA. The IRA may 
only be worth $690,150 after income and estate taxes, if he and his 
wife die in that year. This same client could have established a wealth 
replacement trust with more than $5.7 million going to his heirs, should 
he have allocated those IRA dollars to a Life Insurance policy. 
Your Large IRA (or qualified money)
$3,000,000
Federal Estate Tax (50%)
$(1,500,000)
State Death Tax (7%)
$(210,000)
Balance Subject to Income Taxes
$1,290,000
Federal Income Taxes (39.6%)
$(510,840)
State Income Taxes (7%)
$(90,300)
Balance to your Heirs
$688,860 (i.e., 23%)
The client’s heirs could lose 23% of the 3 million IRA. With proper 
planning, the double-tax is solved with a tax-advantaged wealth building 
Life Insurance policy. 
Having your retirement money exposed to financial losses in the market 
is not an effective strategy to provide for your financial future. The 
insightful advice of the legendary fund manager from Fidelity, Peter 
Lynch is still practical: “The absolute golden rule about investing is – 
No matter how good the market looks, never invest money you can’t 
afford to lose.” Will Rogers made the following wise observation: “I’m 

TRANSFORM
310
more concerned with the return of my principal than the return on my 
principal.” 
We have reviewed only three of many financial strategies that can 
provide you peace of mind, knowing that your money is safe. First, there 
are non-taxable investment strategies. The second financial strategy 
is an IRA Rescue Strategy. The third financial strategy is to solve the 
double-tax trap sometimes called the 75% tax-trap. Indexed Universal 
Life insurance can provide a financial instrument capable of lowering 
your taxable income in an environment of increasing taxes. 
The Indexed Universal Life has these many outstanding features: You 
can take money in your retirement tax-free, without principal risk, you 
have access to your money, continued premiums even if disabled, tax-
free death benefit for your family and protected from judgments and 
lawsuits. They could also avoid the 85% taxing of Social Security 
benefits. Do you know of any other financial instrument that surpasses 
these benefits? 
I have heard that Warren Buffett has encouraged other investors to utilize 
the “Age Investment Ratio” (AIR). An individual age 60 would have 
60% of his investments in safety. One of the safest financial instruments 
available today is Indexed Universal Life.
“Right now, you are able to grow the cash value inside of your Universal 
Life policy tax-deferred, and then access this cash value tax-free, utilizing 
the Policy Loan Provision. You might want to consider getting on this 
train before it leaves the station! Because once it leaves, it’s likely 
gone.” The Retirement Miracle, Patrick Kelly 
“The tax exemption for life insurance is the single biggest benefit in 
the tax code! Make it a part of your retirement savings plan and your 
estate plan. Now is the time to create a plan to rescue your retirement 
and move your money from accounts that are forever taxed to accounts 
that are never taxed.” —Ed Slott, CPA, America’s IRA Expert, Best-
Selling Author, Public Speaker, Educator

PLUNGING TO SUCCESS
CHAPTER 34
PLUNGING TO SUCCESS
BY STEPHEN DEVLIN
I first met Brian Tracy in the spring of 2014 in New York City at the 
National Association of Experts, Writers & Speakers conference. Brian 
was there to receive a lifetime achievement award and I was there to 
receive a writer’s award for a book I wrote in 2013. This was nearly 15 
years after reading Brain’s life-transforming written word.
It’s 1999, and my job with a consumer goods company has fallen victim 
to downsizing. Thirty-three years old, already divorced for three, I had 
no savings. Armed with eight years sales management experience, I was 
at a complete loss as to what I was going to do. Despite a pretty good 
severance package, I was floundering. 
Job loss can cause all sorts of weird things to your brain: depression, 
laziness, low self-worth, and the inability to see the positive. My 
severance package lasted me eight months after a half-hearted job 
search. A couple of weeks earlier the panic button went off while lying 
on a local beach. I had to stop feeling sorry for myself. I had to get out 
there and find something I would love to do. I turned to the Internet and 
ironically, at the time, found a sales position working for an online job 
site. 
An innovative job in the dotcom industry, I headed up the BC office 
for an Ontario-based company. I had been an ice cream guy for eight 
years. Motivating kids and teenagers to sell frozen treats to folks who 
hated our repetitious vending music. This job was new territory for me, 
because this job required more than sales management. It required hard-

TRANSFORM
314
core cold calling. I had to call on human resource executive officers, 
managers and assistants to pitch them on the benefits of posting their 
jobs on our website. I didn’t know a thing about selling to businesses 
(B2B). And, I was on 100% commission! I was terrified but excited at 
the same time!
It was a lot of fun but I needed to learn how to sell strategically and 
to close more sales presentations. I decided to work on myself, 
investing in programs such as The Pursuit of Excellence, The Wall, 
and The Advancement of Excellence, amongst others. I gained a better 
understanding of myself and how to fight through my insecurities and 
life’s obstacles. I am a big believer in learning from the expertise and 
experience of others. 
During my self-improvement journey, I came across The Great Big Book 
of Wisdom; it was my first introduction to Brian Tracy. He shared his life 
experiences and advice through motivational quotes. It was one of those 
books that didn’t become “shelf-help”. I read it during my challenging 
days. It made me feel better, more capable. The cold calling was tiring 
and stressful. The beginning of each sales month gave me “world 
collapsing on top of me” moments. I don’t think many people like cold 
calling. However, I learned great lessons about myself; especially how 
to react and live with rejection. 
Brian’s work enlightened me to opportunities to better myself, to find 
places in my life that were not comfortable but necessary to be stronger 
and happier, to be positive. I won several top sales awards and was 
consistently the number one sales rep in that company. That career was 
really the place I learned how to sell and how to help solve problems 
for people with solutions that worked. Unfortunately, the dotcom melt 
down ushered me into the unemployment line once again. I found myself 
shutting one door while another one opened.
I believe my entrepreneurial spirit really started after that last layoff. I 
didn’t like relying on someone else’s decisions on how they wanted to 
run their business. I wanted to be in control of my own destiny. To create 
a life that had more purpose and the ability to help more people. The 
opportunity came to me and my wife, Michele, back in 2003 when we 
bought the Canadian rights to a web-based realtor marketing program. 
It was an extremely successful venture for us for 4 years, but we had 

315
PLUNGING TO SUCCESS
no control over development and could see that market changes where 
quickly whittling away at the company and exited that business. The 
learning experiences from those years were huge. We realized that 
working for ourselves was the best way for us to achieve our goals and 
dreams. 
When you achieve a certain level of success you have a decision to either 
stay comfortable and stagnate or take more risk to grow. The fear can 
be so strong that it prevents new successes from happening. We knew 
what our goals were and we had the confidence to take more risk, so 
we bought a magazine-publishing franchise. We hired the best business 
coaches and lawyers to help us set-up this new venture. Unfortunately, 
we lost our shirts and went from having a significant net worth down 
to having a massive amount of debt. It was a humbling experience. The 
stress was monumental, but our tenacity to succeed and our dedication 
to each other made us stronger.
Debt was suffocating us, and I was a daily worrier. Despite an excellent 
credit rating, the banks turned their backs on us. It was a slap in the face 
after doing so much business with them during the good years. I can 
remember talking to one of my best buddies who was also in business 
for himself and going through similar challenges. He pointed out that 
we were still living well. We all owned houses, drove decent cars, went 
out for dinner and on vacations occasionally. He said to keep moving 
forward and not to put so much fear around it. Look at it as just numbers. 
This advice really helped us as we started to figure what we wanted to 
do next. 
Transforming any part of your life is not an easy thing to do. When I 
was pouting and stressing out about the debt and lack of income at that 
time, Michele would always say, “You don’t become successful without 
the plunges.” I don’t know what I would have done without her. She is 
my rock and the person I can rely on to help me get through some of the 
darkest days. She is the problem solver and has an incredible ability to 
quickly find solutions to our problems. 
The falls in life teach us a lot about ourselves. I don’t know you, but I

more successful. Probably one reason is to make more money, right? 
Heck, there is nothing wrong with wanting to be rich. But, there is no 
magic bill or silver bullet. Life is a series of challenges to help you 
grow. It’s hard work. These challenges suck and feel awful at the time, 
but as you get through them you become stronger and have more skills 
to pick yourself up on the next fall. Don’t brush them away because of 
fear of pain. Embrace them and know it’s a learning experience. 
I also believe in embracing my spirituality and building my relationship 
with God. It comes with serving others. Whether it’s family, friends, 
clients, or strangers, helping people brings me great joy. I felt I needed 
to find my place in the world by making people’s lives easier. It was 
something I had been searching for since I was a teenager. Funny how 
life works out because my calling was the exact thing that was stressing 
me out for most of my life; debt and how to manage money!
You learned earlier about my pain around debt and losing all our 
wealth to a bad business venture. There are lessons in my experiences 
I already talked about, but one of the largest transformations for me 
came in learning about the financial world. Now I need to pass that 
knowledge on to you. I actually could write an entire book about it but 
I’ll have to do it in the 1,200 or so words I have left. A tall order for sure. 
Perhaps you’re wondering why I spent so much time on my life. Well, 
the reason is because you need to feel some sort of connection with me. 
To know I’ve been there. The bottom line is that I can help you become 
financially set for life WITHOUT taking unnecessary risk. How? From 
my own experiences and what I did to put our financial house back in 
order. Begin having a life without financial stress.
When Michele and I were going through our own financial hell, we had 
many money worries and questions. So I ask you: Are you concerned 
about not having enough money for when you get older? Do you want 
to know your money is safe and guaranteed? Are you tired of losing 
money in the stock and real estate markets? Will you be able to support 
your family if you get sick, disabled, or die? Are you sick and tired of 
having to pay interest to banks and credit card companies? Discouraged 
in having to prove your worth to get money? We asked ourselves these 
things and more. 
We knew there had to be a solution out there, but conventional financial 

317

wisdom and advice was, frankly, letting us down. That’s when a dear 
friend in Florida introduced us to two books that had a huge impact 
on our lives and completely transformed our financial wows into 
financial freedom! These books were Becoming Your Own Banker by 
Nelson R. Nash and Bank on Yourself by Pamela Yellen. We were blown 
away by how simple the concepts were and how powerful it could be 
in our lives. It gave us the safety net we needed and the solution to 
never rely on a bank again; for not just our lifetime, but our son’s and 
future generations. It gave us a strategy to eliminate all that debt we 
had and never go back into debt again. We certainly were skeptical and 
wondered why our financial advisor didn’t tell us about this incredible 
concept. So, the lesson for you is to do what we did and read these 
books. Conduct your own due-diligence. Ask questions and be open to 
learning. If your financial life is a disaster like ours was, there is hope. 
You can transform it! The answers to your deep questions, worries and 
insecurities start with these books and my help. This is my passion and 
the reason I became a financial coach, advisor and author. 
So before we part ways for now, you’re probably wondering what 
this financial miracle could be; Right? Surprisingly, it is one of the 
most least-understood financial instruments out there. Yet, it has been 
around for more than 160 years in North America. Dividend- Paying 
(participating) Whole Life Insurance through a mutually-owned life 
insurance company! OK, I know. Not that exciting and kind of boring. 
Don’t turn to the next chapter. Stay with me, because what seems boring 
on the surface is actually pretty interesting and exciting!
Not all whole life insurance is created equal. There are the boring and 
gloomy policies to cover your loved ones from financial losses in your 
demise. But what if you could own a policy to help you while you are 
living? One that gives you an asset greater than real estate! If designed 
right, these types of policies turn you into your own banker. I’ve been 
my own banker for several years now and you can too. You don’t have 
to die to win!
We were able to get ahead because these policies gave us all the things 
we wanted our money to do. They’ll do the same for you: contractual 
guaranteed growth, liquidly, tax deferred growth, guaranteed death 
benefit to transfer wealth tax-free to loved ones, creditor protection, 
access to money with no restrictions or credit checks, and much more! 

TRANSFORM
318
But the most exciting aspect of these policies for me is you compound 
100% of your money while borrowing up to 90% to finance your life’s 
necessities. Pay off debt, finance cars, vacations, business equipment, 
education, or whatever and without a credit check! It’s your money to 
do with what you want. 
A participating whole life insurance contract will be the one of your 
greatest assets you will ever own in your lifetime. It takes patience 
and long-term vision, but the rewards are huge. The key is to use the 
equity in your policy while you are living. It gets more efficient each 
year and becomes a “cash storage facility” you can rely on – no matter 
what happens in the real estate and stock markets. It is NOT about 
rate of return. It’s about reversing the flow of your money so you can 
stop paying interest to others and free yourself from banks and finance 
companies. There is no better feeling than to hear my clients talk about 
the freedom they now have. How relieved they are to now have a place 
for their money that really works to THEIR benefit. My clients are the 
reason I do what I do, and I am so grateful to have them in my life. 
Life is precious and short! Michele had cancer last year at age 47 and 
we almost lost her. I can’t tell you how scared I was for her, my son 
and myself. But I wasn’t scared about our finances. Will you be if such 
a tragedy strikes? You don’t have to be. To eliminate your financial 
stressors and transform your life takes a different way of looking at 
things. In this chapter I showed you my choices to persevere despite 
life challenges. They gave me the opportunity to learn, but most of all I 
realized I had to work. I couldn’t just sit on a beach waiting for things to 
happen. Your finances can’t wait either. 
Thanks for reading and God bless!

THE GREATEST LIE MY DAD EVER TOLD ME AND HOW HIS DEATH REVEALED THE TRUTH
CHAPTER 35
THE GREATEST LIE 
MY DAD EVER TOLD  
ME AND HOW HIS  
DEATH REVEALED  
THE TRUTH
BY DR. PHILLIP YOO 
My parents were hard-working immigrants from Korea. Many 
Americans take this great country for granted, growing up with a sense 
of entitlement. Quite the opposite is true with immigrants. They show 
up with nothing more than a suitcase and a strong work ethic. They only 
see the future; they don’t have a past to blame. That’s why so many 
immigrants achieve the “American Dream.”
I grew up listening to my mom tell stories about when she and my dad 
first arrived in New York. They had to survive on my dad’s meager 
salary he earned as a hospital resident. They lived in a tiny, cockroach-
infested apartment and barely spoke any English. 
Like all Korean-American kids, I was expected to excel academically. 
Truth be told, I was more interested in reading about my favorite comic 
book heroes. But my parents told me that if I study hard, get into a good 
college and become a doctor, I could then get a job that would provide 
financial security and a good lifestyle. 

TRANSFORM
322
I grew up watching my dad do all the things he preached. He worked 
hard as a medical doctor. He was always on call, chained to a pager that 
would go off late at night and on the weekends. 
He worked like that for decades. 
Just two years away from retirement, my dad suffered a sudden brain 
stroke. It happened as he was driving through Tennessee on his way to 
Florida for some much needed relaxation. He got a severe headache and 
checked into a hotel to get some rest.
He never woke up. 
The doctors in Tennessee couldn’t save him. My mom had to pay 
$10,000 to have a plane fly him home. His “elite medical insurance” 
didn’t cover this expense. At my dad’s funeral, I remember thinking 
how the so called “best medical care in the world” had failed.
Here was my father—a Medical Doctor who specialized in brain and 
mental disorders—supposedly with access to the best medical providers 
and insurance coverage money could buy. Ironically, the very institution 
he worked in couldn’t save him, let alone cover his medical bills. 
So, the greatest lie my dad ever told me was the same lie he’d been 
told: That being a doctor would provide financial security and 
freedom, and that the medical profession would take care of me and 
my health. 
The day my father passed away, I vowed to NEVER become a slave 
to my work. Instead, I’d work on my terms and dedicate my life 
to transforming the way medicine is practiced in America. This 
would mean taking the power away from the bureaucratic hospital, 
pharmaceutical and insurance companies, and giving it back to 
the doctor where it belongs. Imagine ... patients would actually 
receive the care they need—not what the hospital administrators 
and insurance companies approve or deny, based on their cost 
containment policies. 
Life moved on ...
After completing pre-medicine studies at Michigan State University, I 
went on to get my Doctorate in Chiropractic Medicine. Upon graduation, 

323
THE GREATEST LIE MY DAD EVER TOLD ME AND HOW HIS DEATH REVEALED THE TRUTH
I chose to give back to the world before starting my own practice. So, I 
devoted one year of my life doing voluntary medical missions in Central 
America—despite being carjacked at gunpoint the day I arrived and 
surviving Hurricane Mitch. During my mission there was a shortage 
of primary care physicians, so the local medical doctors trained me 
how to prescribe common drugs, deliver injections and assist in minor 
surgeries. 
After my sojourn to Central America, I moved to Korea and opened up 
two chiropractic practices. 
After working long hours running my clinics for 10 years, I was burnt out. 
I had become a prisoner of my business, which was the very thing I had 
set out not to do. It was a job I couldn’t quit. As the sole proprietor, I had 
taken on a business that wouldn’t run without my presence. On the home 
front, my wife was complaining that I was never around—and when I 
was, all I did was sleep. It got so bad that we were on the brink of divorce. 
To save our marriage I knew that I had to make a big transformation. I 
left the two practices in the hands of my associate doctors and moved 
to California to get help with our marriage from the minister who 
married us. 
Going back to Korea was not an option. I had to find a way to run the 
practices without being there!
After much research, trial and error, I discovered that a professional 
practice, or any business can be run without physically working “in 
the business.” There are four primary roles the owner must fill that 
can be universally applied to any business. They are:
1) The Manual Laborer 
2) The Macromanager 
3) The Mighty CEO 
4) The Marketer
If these four roles are not in balance, business burnout is likely on 
the horizon. 
In my SuperHero Coaching Program, I teach 40 “Super Powered 
Skills” in those four specific areas. Because you’re reading this book 

TRANSFORM
324
you’re about to discover a few nuggets in these areas that you can 
IMMEDIATELY implement in your practice or business to make 
more money and to spend more time with your loved ones. 
The first role is the “manual laborer,” where you find yourself performing 
the hands-on, hourly-wage type of work. In the chiropractic profession 
that typically means treatments and office work. When I started my 
first practice, I did much more than treat patients. I did bookkeeping, 
answered phones, emptied trash, etc. Excessive manual labor may be 
necessary in the beginning when hiring staff is too costly. The irony is 
that business growth will be restricted unless you replace yourself by 
hiring employees to do the $10/hour type of work. 
Once you’ve hired employees to perform “manual labor,” you’ll have 
to manage them. Manager is another role that doctors get trapped 
into doing. They’re terrible at it because they’re multi-tasking as 
doctor, manager and manual laborer. Many business owners not only 
make the mistake of doing too much manual labor, but they also think 
that they have to manage the employees by themselves. They end up 
getting in their own way—which is inefficient, unproductive and leads 
to frustration. 
In my case, I also made the mistake of being in the office micromanaging 
the staff. Although I took myself out of the manual labor role, I created 
another full-time “job” acting as the business macromanager. I solved 
this by hiring a clinic manager to oversee the staff and run the internal 
operations. This freed me up to use my time where it’s most valuable, 
which takes us to the third role …
The CEO is not just the company’s figurehead, but a Super Hero 
who can effectively envision, innovate, strategize and lead his 
team to implement the company’s goals. The CEO should always be 
looking to the future of the business through research and innovation—
and effectively communicating the big vision to the staff.
Furthermore, being CEO doesn’t mean you have to sit in a big lonely 
office all day. Your physical presence may be necessary a few hours a 
week to keep a pulse on what’s happening in the office and to maintain 
employee morale. But, you’ll find that your best business ideas and 
breakthroughs occur when you’re disconnected from the office. There’s 
an old saying, “A successful Entrepreneur CEO spends most of his 

325
THE GREATEST LIE MY DAD EVER TOLD ME AND HOW HIS DEATH REVEALED THE TRUTH
time working ON the business, not IN the business.” 
In my industry, most practice owners are in their offices all day grinding 
away with patient treatments, writing patient notes, billing insurance 
and micromanaging staff. After all that, there’s not much time left to be 
CEO and plan for the future. That’s how most doctors, or any business 
owner, will eventually burn out. Being in the business all day and 
trying to do everything yourself is unsustainable. No wonder 80% of 
businesses fail within 5 years. 
As CEO, it’s imperative to create reproducible systems for your 
business and hire quality people to run those systems. Theoretically, 
if you were to open your practice or business in any city in the U.S., 
you should be able to operate successfully and smoothly because 
you have reproducible, documented systems and you can hire 
replaceable employees to drive those systems. 
However, be forewarned that systems can fail if they’re not constantly 
improved. For example, disaster struck my business when I discovered 
that the associate doctors I had entrusted with my Korean clinics had 
started their own practices without my knowledge, swiping my patient 
records and recruiting my patients and staff.
This brings us to the next Super Powered Skill: always be looking for 
and recruiting super staff to run your Super Powered Systems. Don’t 
expect employees to last forever, even the stars. Eventually those who 
work for you will either wake up one day with an “entrepreneurial 
urge,” taking what they learned from you to start their own business, 
or they’ll go lame and quit or have to be fired. 
Pay close attention to who you hire, and always be on the lookout for 
your next ex-star employee. Create a “virtual bench” so you won’t find 
yourself in a bind when a position needs to be filled. 
After miraculously selling off my practices in Korea, I figured I could 
start a practice in California and implement the systems which I learned 
and developed. So, I bought another doctor’s practice. Long story short, 
the seller didn’t stick around for a smooth transition, didn’t introduce 
me to his patients, nor did he show me the ropes on insurance billing. 
The few patients that remained had insurance plans that discontinued 
coverage. 

TRANSFORM
326
Adding insult to injury, I severely injured my back during this time and 
developed excruciating sciatic leg pains. Life as I knew it changed in 
an instant. I couldn’t play sports. I couldn’t concentrate. I couldn’t even 
lift up my kids. I was to the point where I could either shut my doors 
because I was headed to the brink of bankruptcy, or I could fight to 
salvage my practice like I did in Korea. 
Well, I’m a Spartan. In Spartan law, it’s illegal to surrender or retreat in 
battle. So I decided to fight on. 
This brings us to another Super Powered Skill: although business 
systems are necessary, they’re not evergreen. Eventually they’ll 
become obsolete and need to be changed through innovation. 
Transformation is a never-ending process. 
I knew I couldn’t totally rely on the systems I created in Korea, nor 
could I rely on billing insurance. I needed a game changer to transform 
my practice into one that would thrive. One thing was for certain: I 
knew I had to find a way to charge cash, up front, for services.
But, before I could take action, I needed to eliminate the debilitating 
sciatic pain. Ironically, all the treatments that I provided as a chiropractor 
did not help! Instead of taking drugs, or getting injections or surgery, I 
discovered hi-powered laser therapy. After only a few treatments my 
pain disappeared. This was a blessing in disguise; it was the exact 
game changer I needed. I integrated hi-powered laser therapy into 
my practice. This not only set me apart from other chiropractors, 
but gave me an “unfair advantage” as the only one using hi-powered 
super laser technology.
This brings us to the next Super Powered Skill: To avoid 
commoditizing your business, you must position it to stand out 
in the marketplace as the only one doing what you do, or selling 
what you sell—then do it extraordinarily well. In my case, I had 
discovered this super powered laser which no other doctor had, and 
developed unique treatment protocols.
Despite my new “Super Power,” I needed to find a way to effectively 
promote it to the public. 

327
THE GREATEST LIE MY DAD EVER TOLD ME AND HOW HIS DEATH REVEALED THE TRUTH
After countless hours of research, I discovered direct response marketing 
and started implementing some of the principles. Lo and behold, they 
actually worked! 
This brings us to the fourth, and arguably the most important practitioner 
or business owner role: being a marketer of your business. Your real 
profession is not what you do, it’s not the degree you earned, nor is it 
the industry you’re in. 
If someone asks me what I do for a living, my natural response is: 
“I’m a chiropractic doctor.” Although that may technically be what 
I do in the business, the real answer is: “I’m the marketer of my 
chiropractic practice.” 
If you’re a medical specialist, you’re really a marketer of your medical 
practice. If you’re a podiatrist, you’re a marketer of your podiatry 
business. Whatever industry you’re in, if you don’t look at your primary 
role in business as being the marketer, then you’ll quickly find yourself 
without a business. It’s marketing that brings in new paying patients, 
clients and customers. You can be the greatest doctor, or have the greatest 
skill in your industry, but if you’re not out marketing and promoting, 
your phone won’t ring.
Turns out, I’m my own best case study. Back in 2010, before I started 
viewing myself as the marketer of my chiropractic practice, my gross 
income was about $30,000. After implementing my Super Powered 
Business Principles I collected $695,000 in 2013, nearly 23 times what I 
did in 2010. In 2014, I’m on track to collect approximately $1.2 million 
in revenue, a whopping 40-fold increase. This is unheard of in my 
industry especially considering that I’m the only doctor working part-
time, three to four hours a day Monday through Thursday. My full, three-
day weekends are devoted to recovery, recreation and relationships. 
This brings us to the final Super Power Skill: you must design your 
practice to serve your lifestyle, instead of being enslaved to serving 
the practice or business.
In order to do this you must sit down and identify the most important 
things in your life. You must write down a set of priorities and vow 
to never compromise them. 

TRANSFORM
328
Here are mine:
1.	“QT” (Quiet Time), which is my personal time with God, every 
morning.
2.	Always take the kids to school.
3.	Exercise six times per week and when the weather is nice, perform 
my workouts outdoors.
4.	Spend no more than 4 hours per day, 4 days per week at the clinic 
(Monday-Thursday).
5.	Have a full 3-day weekend to devote more time to my faith, family, 
friends and fitness.
6.	Until my kids are out of the house, I will spend as much time as 
possible with them. Thus, I will not do any business travel more 
than necessary.
7.	I never work or even attend seminars on Sundays, as that is church 
and family time. 
No matter what, these seven priorities take precedence over my business, 
in order to maintain my liberated lifestyle by design.
I’ve been fortunate to fulfill my mission of achieving a liberated 
lifestyle, while helping to transform the practice of medicine. Now, my 
new mission is to help other doctors and those in the health care industry 
or any business achieve the same.

THE RELATIONSHIP TRANSFORMATION…TAKING RELATIONSHIPS FROM TERMINAL TO TRANSFORMED
CHAPTER 36
THE RELATIONSHIP  
TRANSFORMATION…  
TAKING RELATIONSHIPS 
FROM TERMINAL  
TO TRANSFORMED
BY SANDY LAWSON
Was there ever a time in your life when you looked back and thought, 
I’d give anything for a do over? When I looked back on the absolute 
worst time in my life, I pondered that very question and came to the 
conclusion that I wouldn’t trade the life lessons I learned during that 
dark time for anything. 
My wonderful husband, Kip and I have been married for over 45 years. 
We have 3 amazing grown kids, and 8 fabulous grandkids. Today, we 
are best friends, and more in love than ever. We get to serve together as 
Care Pastors at one of the fastest growing churches in America, which 
just happens to be pastored by our oldest son. 
It wasn’t always that way…
Our marriage in every rational sense was doomed from the start. After 
a whirlwind romance of three months, we ran away and got married in 
Mexico when I was 17 and he was 18. The fact that everyone said we’d 
never make it was often the only glue that held us together. Our life was 

TRANSFORM
332
a roller coaster ride at best, until we became Christians when our first-
born son was about 5. The next few years seemed stable to the untrained 
eye, but under the surface issues that had never been resolved simmered 
at a slow boil.
About the time our oldest faced the challenge of middle school, what 
had been simmering below the surface erupted, and my husband and 
I went through three years of pure hell dragging our poor kids in 
tow. Counselors told us that they had never seen a marriage in worse 
condition in their 25 years of counseling experience. They told us it 
was hopeless. Divorce seemed the only sane option, and so my husband 
filed. Throughout the whole ordeal, we were only a signature away from 
a final decree, neither of us quite got around to signing on the dotted 
line.
I came to my senses first, and began the journey back to sanity. I can 
only describe it like waking from a bad dream, I remember thinking, 
“I did that?” I thought that? It was a bit surreal, but despite the trail of 
destruction in our life, and the fact my emotions were numbed from 
all the abuse, I knew in my heart that God was not done with Kip and 
Sandy yet. I refused to believe the naysayers, even though they were 
supposed to be the experts. I chose to forgive myself, and my husband 
for all the horrendous things we’d done to ourselves, each other, and to 
our poor kids during that time. I decided to make my stand, no nagging, 
just living a changed life. It took a year, but my husband decided the 
right thing to do was to come home. 
Let me make it clear, we both felt little for each other, but realized 
forgiveness was a choice not a feeling. The first thing we did was call 
a family meeting and ask our kids forgiveness for all we’d put them 
through. We vowed that we were committed to building our family and 
there was no turning back. 
That was over 30 years ago and we could not be happier about the pivotal 
decisions we made at that time. Would I want to relive those three years, 
absolutely not, but the person I’ve become on the other side of the pain 
makes it worth the struggle. It’s my hope that our story will help others 
to change their story as well.
In our 21st century global society, I believe we tend to overcomplicate 
things. We can take the simple and make it complex. Perhaps it makes 

333
THE RELATIONSHIP TRANSFORMATION…TAKING RELATIONSHIPS FROM TERMINAL TO TRANSFORMED
us feel safe to hide behind convoluted mysterious rhetoric, because 
it does not require us to change. As for me, I’ve decided that life is 
not that complicated. It can be boiled down to some simple principles, 
that when applied, optimize your chances for joy, peace, and health in 
every relationship in your life. Here are 7 keys to transforming your 
relationships.
1. EVERYTHING STARTS WITH A THOUGHT
Every great invention, noble deed, personal breakthrough, and 
conversely every act of adultery, divorce, and all mayhem started with 
just one thought. When that thought was held for more than a moment, 
it led to another, and another, until it became an attitude that expressed 
itself in words and actions. Amazingly, for the average person, 80% of 
the thoughts they think are the same thoughts they had yesterday, and 
the day before, and the day before that. I think you can agree that we 
need to stop and think about what we are thinking about. We really do 
have the power to choose our thoughts. 
2. OUR WORDS HAVE CREATIVE POWER 
Back when man came into being, the Creator taught the created how 
to create. He said, “Adam, name the animals.” And, whatever Adam 
named them, that’s what they would be called. Today, our words hold 
the same power, what we name things is what they become. 
Here’s an example: a young man, we’ll call him Fred, is offered an 
opportunity. What does Fred call it? “That’s impossible, it is way too 
hard. I could never do that!” Another young man, we’ll call him Bob, is 
offered the exact same opportunity. What does Bob call it? “This is the 
opportunity I’ve been looking for all my life. I must be the luckiest guy 
on the planet! I can do this!”
Now let’s take this “Name It Principle” into our personal lives, what are 
you naming your relationships?
Are your kids, “Can’t you ever do anything right?” “How many times 
do I have to tell you?” “Do you have anything between those ears?” 
“You’ll never amount to anything.” Or do you name them, “You have 
amazing potential.” “I can’t believe how bright you are!” “There’s an 
amazing plan for your life that’s better than anything you can imagine 
or dream.” 

TRANSFORM
334
How about your marriage, your job, your finances, what are you naming 
them? How about this, what do you name yourself? Be careful what you 
say, you are creating something. Make sure it is what you want.
3. 90/10 PRINCIPLE
In our close relationships, it’s easy to focus on the 10% others do wrong 
instead of focusing on the 90% that they do right. Unfortunately, what 
you focus on tends to get bigger. I believe that a common reason people 
fall into the trap of focusing on the 10% deficiency is because that person 
is making them look bad. This is especially common in the parent child 
relationship. The parent feels their child’s actions are a direct reflection 
on them. 
On the flip side, think of your own life, when someone, a parent, a spouse, 
a boss, tends to focus on what you do wrong and never or rarely praises 
for what you do right, what happens? Do you feel defeated, or does it 
make you angry? Or worst of all, does it make you want to give up?
I’m not advocating overlooking positive correction, but I’m 
recommending in all your relationships you focus far more of your 
energy on encouraging others in what they do right. There are already 
enough sources telling them everything they do wrong. The really great 
thing is when we focus on the 90% right, the 10% usually self corrects. 
So make a choice to affirm what others do right daily and tell them. 
4. KEEP SHORT ACCOUNTS
Be quick to forgive. Unforgiveness is a personal prison you sentence 
yourself to. This was one of the biggest keys to harmony and peace in 
our family. We called it keeping “short accounts.” 
Forgiveness has nothing to do with how we feel, it is a choice we make. 
It’s not an emotional decision, it’s a heart choice. Sometimes we have 
to make it, and make it, and make it, as many times as it takes until it 
sticks. Your choice will bring you the life-changing freedom that only 
true forgiveness can bring, if you stay consistent in making good choices 
in the thoughts you keep and the ones you discard. 
We taught our kids that when they realized they did something unkind 
to one another, they needed to immediately go to the person involved 
and ask their forgiveness. We taught them to say, “I was wrong for 

335
THE RELATIONSHIP TRANSFORMATION…TAKING RELATIONSHIPS FROM TERMINAL TO TRANSFORMED
________, will you forgive me?” And hopefully the response would 
come back, “I forgive you.” Remember, there is creative power in our 
words. Important: once we forgave, we never brought it up again.
We all lived by, when you blow it, man up and own it. Ask forgiveness 
quickly so bitterness and unforgiveness never have the opportunity to 
take root. “I was wrong, but you . . . “ just didn’t get it. That was blaming 
not owning in our household. Any time you put a “but” in a sentence, 
you can forget anything that came before.
Are you in a self-imposed prison of unforgiveness? Now you have the 
key, use it and set yourself free.
5. PUT OTHERS FIRST
It’s not all about you. In our take care of number one culture, this 
goes cross grain with our logic. Humans by nature tend toward self-
centeredness. We can have such a fear of loss that if we aren’t careful, 
we can get swallowed in a vortex of selfishness. Then, we lose sight 
of the simple fact that true joy comes from giving not from getting. 
When we decide to put others needs before our own, something almost 
magical happens, our soul feels truly fulfilled. Over the holidays we 
experience a microcosm of this truth as we exchange gifts, or when we 
hand out Christmas dinners at a homeless shelter. Giving just makes us 
feel great. The truth is, at the very core of our being we were designed 
to find our life when we give it away. 
6. KEEP FIRST THINGS FIRST
The most important thing in life is knowing  
the most important things in life.  
~ David Jakeilo
Sometimes life controls us instead of us controlling our life. It is vital 
to periodically stop and take an accounting of our priorities lest we fall 
prey to the tyranny of the urgent. Your priorities will be determined by 
your value system. However, I would encourage anyone to think long 
and hard before they put their career at the top of their priority list. Life 
passes all too quickly and you know the old saying, “You never see 
a hearse towing a Uhaul.” The “stuff” stays behind. Our real legacy 
remains behind in the lives of those we impacted along the way. 

TRANSFORM
336
For me, my priorities are my faith, my marriage, my kids and grandkids, 
then my career. It seems when I keep things in that order, my life is 
really great. When my priorities shift, my life can go into a tailspin 
in nothing flat. When I see the very first tell tale sign that I’ve gotten 
myself out of sync, I stop and do a quick self evaluation and invariably 
I find that my priorities have gotten misplaced. 
Keeping your priorities in order is like a pilot keeping his eye on the 
Altitude Indicator to make sure that the plane is flying level. Remember 
to do regular “Priority Checks.”
7. NEVER STOP DREAMING
Children are dreamers, they see themselves doing great and noble 
things. “When I grow up, I’m going to be . . . a firefighter, a policeman, 
a nurse.” Yet, as the realities of life sink in around us, it is all too easy 
to give up on dreaming. 
Is it because dreams involve risk? I don’t know, but I do know that I 
sit and counsel with way too many people who have quit dreaming. 
Without dreams we do not live, we exist. Without dreams there is no 
passion. Without dreams there is no vision and as it is written, “Without 
a vision the people perish.” Don’t let the comfortable and the convenient 
rob you of your destiny. You were created for greatness, but before 
greatness comes dreaming. Chose big humongous impossible dreams 
that challenge you. Take the risk, dare to dream again.
If you apply these seven keys faithfully to your life, I promise you’ll 
experience personal freedom like never before, and a new level of joy, 
peace, and health in all your relationships.

MODERN DAY PROJECT MANAGEMENT
CHAPTER 37
MODERN DAY PROJECT  
MANAGEMENT:  
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW  
TO BE SUCCESSFUL  
IN TODAY’S CHALLENGING  
ENVIRONMENT
BY ANDREW CLINE
I hate project management and what it has become. It has been analyzed 
and dissected so much that it’s on its way to becoming a commodity. It 
seems that everyone wants to dive into the nitty-gritty, and if you subscribe 
to any of the PM groups that have discussions, most of the chatter is about 
what is the single biggest risk your project faces, or what certification is 
better to have, or what is the one sign that a project is failing. 
It is a shame that a skill set that has been the cornerstone of productive 
society since the Greeks and Romans is being reduced to quick 140 
character blurbs that seemingly can save your failing project. There is so 
much more to project management success. The current day conversations 
are like discussing exercise without mentioning diet. It is tough to build a 
better body while eating Pop Tarts and drinking diet cola.
So, why the defense of a topic that I  rarely talk about to people outside of 
work? Because I would not have achieved the success I have had in both 

TRANSFORM
340
my professional and personal life if it were not for project management. 
I used to joke that when I was managing a project, there was part 
science and part art involved. The ratios changed based upon what the 
circumstances called for, but the two parts where always involved. After 
all, the goal of project management is to deliver a “successful” outcome, 
on-time and on-budget, right?
But what I realize now is that project management was one component 
of a three-part success formula that every successful project manager 
I have known utilizes. The other two components that worked with 
project management were relationship management and subject 
matter expertise. Each of these three components plays a key role. 
No one is more important that the other, and they rely heavily on 
each other to deliver successful outcomes. The best project plan with 
linked dependencies, validated with a Monte Carlo Analysis, supported 
by a robust resource management plan won’t deliver success if the 
stockholders are not engaged to the right level, or if you have no idea 
how to identify and mitigate the major risks if you cannot understand 
what the project team members are saying to you.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT
There are five major things that successful project managers focus on. 
There are dozens of smaller items that you need to pay attention to, 
but the most successful project managers focus on Timing, Budget, 
Resources, Communication, and Process. 
The first three items, timing, budget, and resources should be 
straightforward. If you wonder why a project manager needs to be 
concerned about the project timeline, how much money has been spent, 
how much is committed, and how much is left or who is doing the work, 
and who is needed to complete the outstanding work, then I would not 
go any further in this article. Please find a basic project management 
guide and start at chapter one.
•	 Communication: I once found myself in charge of the technical 
team tasked with saving a $1.3 billion, 10-year project. The 
prime contractor was fired after three years of negative progress. 
The first thing I did every morning for the first four months was 
participate on a call with the other team leads and key stakeholders 
for 30 minutes. The agenda was simple and clear: What did you 

341
MODERN DAY PROJECT MANAGEMENT
accomplish yesterday, what are you accomplishing today, and what 
do you need help with? This simple communication process helped 
set the team up for success in the roughest part of the project. I took 
that lesson and applied it within my own team, and I have used 
it many times, especially when dealing with difficult decisions. 
How predictable and capable are the communication methods you 
have in place? Can you get to the information you need when you 
need it? Is there a lot of wasted effort gathering and compiling 
information that no one will review? Begin with the end in mind. 
Determine what information you need to be an effective leader 
and then design the process to get that information as easily and 
consistently as you need it.
•	 Process: When I worked for Deloitte and Oracle Consulting, 
the one item that was repeated most often was that following 
the established  project delivery process would lead to project 
success. I have carried that with me throughout my career. When 
I am managing a large multi-million-dollar project I know that I 
need to establish and maintain key processes for information to 
flow and for the work to be done at a high level of quality. I know 
that a repeatable process leads to a predictable outcome. I would 
have regular meetings—weekly/monthly/quarterly—that were 
arranged so that information could be rolled up and then back 
out in a logical fashion, so the work and decision-making could 
continue unabated. Other key processes established include those 
related to to requirements, testing, risk mitigation, and resource 
management. Successful project management peers of mine also 
have a set of key processes that work for them and can be applied 
to a variety of projects with minimal adjustments.
RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT
Relationship management is a term that encompasses a lot of territory. 
For brevity’s sake I will define it as how you deal with other people, 
and how you let them deal with you. I have identified five keys to 
better relationship management that are exhibited by successful project 
managers. The five are Diplomacy, Accountability, Engagement, 
Consistency, and Motivation.
•	 Diplomacy: You need to seek out the win-win around 80 percent 
of the time. There are times that call for unpopular decisions, but 

TRANSFORM
342
you cannot rule like a dictator and be successful in the long term. 
Additionally, you need to learn how to manage up as well as down. 
This includes learning how to share information so that there are 
no surprises, and so you can avoid the catastrophic scenario of 
over-promising and under-delivering.
•	 Accountability: This is a two-way street where you must practice 
what you preach. In order for team members to be held accountable, 
you need to set the example and hold yourself accountable to at 
least the same standard if not a higher one. If you need people to 
work full weeks to hit project milestones, don’t run out the door 
every Friday afternoon at 3 PM to avoid the traffic.
•	 Engagement: It is key to actively seek out and nurture engagement 
at all levels of individuals involved in your projects, from the 
executive level, to the front line worker. Engagement breeds trust, 
information sharing, and lasting relationships. Motivation is a key 
component of engagement, especially on long-term projects. You 
need to be sure to celebrate milestones and remind people that what 
they are working on will have a major impact on the project and the 
organization as a whole.
•	 Consistency: I once had a manager that was the typical Dr. Jekyll 
and Mrs. Hyde. When you brought an issue to her attention, you 
never knew if you would be prized for being proactive or chastised 
for obviously missing the warning signs. It made everyone 
around very uneasy and it became a huge barrier to the free flow 
of information. Be measured and consistent in how you deal 
with people, information, and situations. People will appreciate 
knowing what they are walking into and this will result in the better 
exchange of information.
•	 Motivation: When you make people feel valuable and appreciated, 
they give you their best. Not when you send them 15 emails on 
Monday morning before lunch telling them to get their status 
reports in and update their timeline estimates. You need to seek to 
build relationships that last. My trick for this is to try to remember 
everyone has a sign above their head that reads “make me feel 
special.” This will not happen every day or every week. But listen 
to people, look at them in the eyes when you talk to them, and 
recognize a job well done. You will be amazed at how much this 
makes a difference.

343
MODERN DAY PROJECT MANAGEMENT
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE
Subject matter expertise is knowing enough about the topic involved in 
the project/discussion to be able to do three things well. First you need to 
be able to ask intelligent questions to satisfy yourself that what you are 
being told is accurate and complete. Second, you need to know enough 
to call bullshit when someone is trying to snow you over. Finally, you 
need to know enough to make decisions and be right about 80 percent 
of the time. A leader leads, and usually this means making a decision. 
If you are not the ultimate authority, then you need to know enough to 
decide what and how you will present the options and which one you 
endorse.
How do you gain subject matter expertise? The same way you eat 
an elephant, one bite at a time. Deconstruct the larger set of material 
into smaller portions and repeat again if necessary. Then you need to 
determine what the 80-20 allocation of material is and focus. That is 
to say, what is the 20 percent of the information that will allow you to 
understand 80 percent of what goes on. I know there are always the one-
off, contingency items that occur once every 10 years, but when you are 
learning something new, focus on the main components first.
To me the best way to get a sense of how a process works is to see 
it/ do it—observe it. I learned the flow of materials in an electronics 
and appliance repair depot by following repair technicians around for a 
couple of days; watching them strip out the components of big screen 
TV’s and cleaning out bird nests from dryer vents. I saw how they did 
their paperwork, where the spare parts came from, and how much they 
could accomplish in one day.
My mind works in a linear, logical method. I have found it helpful to 
create process flow charts for the main activities you need to learn. 
Additionally, you can find a guide that will coach and advise you when 
you are getting going. Find the person that has been there, done that, 
and has the T-shirt to prove it. They will save you a dozen times in your 
initial time on the project. Seek their counsel on an ongoing basis to 
ensure you remain on the right track. This is especially true when they 
are not involved in the day to day of the project. They will have an 
easier time seeing the forest for the trees. 

TRANSFORM
344
I was involved in a project for a small city in the Midwest and was 
assigned to the water and sewer department as part of my responsibility. 
My interactions with public water and sewer departments at that time 
was limited to paying my water bills. When I showed up, I was quickly 
told that I was the third consultant that was assigned to help them; the 
other two had failed or left, and they did not want to invest the time 
to train me. So they loaded me up with SOP’s and wished me luck in 
discovering how they worked. Without really having anywhere else 
to turn for info I fell back on my skills of deconstructing, developing 
processes and observing. Within a week I had learned enough to ask 
intelligent questions that neither of my predecessors had asked. I was 
able to win over my three main contacts at the department and we were 
able to successfully implement the new system ahead of schedule due 
to their desire to work with me. We worked so well together that when I 
left I received a retired, but freshly painted fire hydrant as a reminder of 
how well we worked together. I still have the hydrant. It is the heaviest 
trophy I have ever been given.
Finally, ask stakeholders and key participants what success looks like? 
Where should the project be at the end? As you ask an increasing 
number of involved people, you will start to see overlap in the answers. 
You could develop a Venn diagram to see the overlap, but I am hoping 
that you are astute enough to see the commonality in the responses and 
the know-how to weigh an executive’s answer more than a random 
interaction in the lunchroom.
This three-part formula has worked for me over and over during my 
rise from IT project manager in a Fortune 500 company to becoming 
the Chief Information Officer for a $9 billion enterprise with a project 
portfolio of $500 million. Your success will not happen overnight. My 
climb took 12 years. But this is not academic theory; success happens 
to other project managers as soon as they implement the formula and 
grow their skill sets. These three components give you the power to be 
successful. The question is, will you take the next step to becoming a 
more successful project manager take action?

CONTINUOUS TRANSFORMATION: A LIFELONG PROCESS
CHAPTER 38
CONTINUOUS  
TRANSFORMATION:  
A LIFELONG  
PROCESS
BY WES JACKSON
I was born into a loving family, being the third of four children. My 
father worked outside the home while my mother was a “stay-at-home 
mom.” Unfortunately, our happy home was disrupted when I was just 
five years old with my father diagnosed as being terminally ill. He died 
slowly over the next seven years and his slow death devastated me and 
my family emotionally, and drained us financially.
As my father was dying, during his last days, I lived with my grandparents. 
They lived simple, yet very consistent lives. Often my grandmother 
would gently tap my face and say “Wes, stay sweet for Jesus, don’t let 
this world make you hard.” She would also say “God loves you and he 
has big plans for you.” These words went a long way to build my self-
worth, heal my hurt, relieve my pain and bring hope to a preteen who 
was experiencing life as it shouldn’t be. People in your life that provide 
you hope and encouragement are a true gift! 
Grandmother also showed me the power of being positive. It seemed 
she could always make something out of next to nothing and this gift 
made her a positive person. She expected things to work out and they 
did. She believed there was always a way and there was. 

TRANSFORM
348
My grandfather and grandmother also imparted to me the concept of 
giving and encouraging. Ministering to others by giving and encouraging 
was their call, their duty, and their lifestyle. As I watched their selfless 
love for others, I got hooked. 
Even as a small boy, giving was a part of me. I collected bottles and cans 
to recycle for money. Much of the time I would use the money to buy 
little glass figurines at the Ben Franklin store for my mother. I wanted 
to make her life a little more bearable as my father was dying. But, I did 
always try to keep at least a little for myself to buy candy. 
Over the years I found that giving has chipped away at my hurt, pain 
and negativity, cultivated seeds of hope and made me feel better about 
myself. Little did I realize that by making a willful choice to perform 
this positive action, healing and a positive attitude would be the result. I 
also learned through giving, that I could be a victor instead of a victim. 
After my father died, my mother remarried a nice man – at least when he 
was sober. You see, my step-father was an alcoholic and that made things 
go from bad to worse. The moral upbringing I once knew didn’t seem 
to matter, and as a result, doubts, fears and insecurities grew within me. 
At 15 years of age, I knew I needed to leave home. Moving out of state 
to live with other family gave me respite and the opportunity for me to 
work on me. This was the start of my personal transformation. I was 
able to find comfort and new direction. From this experience I learned 
where you live, what you do and who you hang around with dramatically 
affects where you go and where you end up.
As I entered adulthood, I was attracted to the financial services industry 
by an ad in the newspaper that indicated I could make a lot of money 
by helping people with their finances. And, there was no limit to the 
amount of money I could earn! I knew how to work hard and I thrived 
on helping others. This was a natural fit! 
At the time, I had a good paying job and was up for a promotion with 
the possibility of even obtaining a company car. The majority of those 
around me told me not to leave this security, but I’m glad I didn’t listen to 
them. I refused to allow these people to crush my dreams. I took the risk. 
Interestingly, as time has passed, these same people have either worked 
for me or borrowed money from me. I learned from this experience not

to let others negatively influence my high ideals or my dreams. I will 
listen to them, respect them, love them, but I will not compromise that 
which I believe to be my destiny. 
With high ideals and big dreams, I studied to pass my insurance and 
investment licenses. Even though I passed, I still didn’t know what to 
do or how to do it. I needed good mentors. I have found that positive 
mentorship is a priceless gift that people of all walks of life vitally need. 
A true mentor is someone who can meet you where you are, teach you 
what you need to know and take you where you want to go. I’ve heard 
it said that experience is a good teacher. However, I quickly discovered 
a better teacher is learning as much as possible from the experiences of 
others. I found that if you get all the help you can get from others that 
are doing what you want to do, you avoid their mistakes and enhance 
the chances of your achievement! 
Zig Ziglar, now a mentor of mine, gave me two guiding principles that 
have influenced me greatly over the years. First, he emphasized positive 
self-talk. Secondly, he said that you can have everything you want in life 
if you just help enough people get what they want in life. I remember 
how these thoughts inspired me, gave me hope and resonated in my 
heart. To this day, I practice these principles on a daily basis. It’s a great 
thing when we can plant seeds of hope in others by sharing positive 
words of encouragement. 
As a young financial services professional, I was extremely hungry to 
learn. I went through sales training and product training and my district 
manager made me enroll in the Life Underwriter Training Council. This 
preparation gave me the foundational knowledge I needed. I eventually 
joined NALU, now the National Association of Insurance and Financial 
Advisors (NAIFA). This gave me access to the experienced professionals 
in my area that I wished to be like and they became mentors and 
examples for me to follow. These great professionals kept me focused, 
encouraged me and held me accountable. 
Drawing from my years with my grandparents, and my respect and 
appreciation for their age group, I was moved to specialize in working with 
seniors and pre-retirees. Amazing things began to happen because many of 
them wanted to meet during the day (which I liked), they were concerned 
about financial planning, they often had money and needed my help. 

TRANSFORM
350
Interestingly, the tragedy from my past that sent me to my grandparents 
actually prepared me for my future. I had familiarity and a connection 
with this generation that may not have happened any other way. This 
and many other experiences have taught me to look for opportunity in 
the obstacles that come my way both personally and in business. It takes 
courage and optimism to do this and to face adversity head on. I believe 
courage is the ability to push aside fear in order to do what is right – 
regardless if it is uncomfortable or risky. 
Adversity gives us the opportunity to practice seemingly irrational 
tenacity and focus on what makes winning possible. I know my tenacity 
and focus has been instrumental in greatly increasing the odds of my 
success. Frankly, without it my success would not have been possible. 
Many times I have used the negatives that others have aimed at me 
as fuel that has energized me in my quest for my goal. In fact, their 
comments have often helped me reach my goals.
I purposefully surrounded myself with people who were like what I 
wanted to be and I often had to ask them for help. I have discovered that 
the process of asking for help actually opens you up as well as others 
around you, enabling the natural goodness in people to come out, and 
allows them to fulfill their desire to help. Before the availability of a 
GPS, I often had to stop and ask for directions. Inevitably, two or three 
people would stand around me wanting to help! People I did not even 
know, using their valuable time, stopped to help me with no strings 
attached. I find that most people like being asked to help. 
As I mentioned previously, early in my career, I found my niche in 
helping retirees and pre-retirees. I also discovered that you can’t help 
people if you are not familiar with what is important to them. So, I 
purposed to become an expert on the needs of retirees. This positioned 
me for my next opportunity. A local national insurance brokerage firm 
wanted me to help them develop their retiree and pre-retiree market. So, 
I went for it. Within a couple of years I was able to develop, build and 
lead this new department in becoming a strong and prominent national 
market leader.
The formula “focus + boundaries + direction = desired results” became 
my guiding principle. I had to stay focused and maintain boundaries 
which kept me from diversions while I kept moving in one direction. I 

351
CONTINUOUS TRANSFORMATION: A LIFELONG PROCESS
found my niche based on my interest, knowledge, strength, integrity and 
personal commitment. This proved to give me crazy success! 
What did this success look like? I started getting contacted by financial 
service trade publications for interviews. I began winning trips all 
around the world. I was making considerably more money than ever 
before. In time, I was asked by home offices of insurance companies to 
help develop and market new products to those in the niche I defined for 
myself years before.
In business, you have to find ways to stay fresh and informed within the 
industry and to continue to excel in your niche. I found one of the best 
ways to learn the business was to teach it. Taking my understanding of 
my specialty, I wrote a training manual on senior market issues. I became 
an approved continuing education instructor, teaching insurance agents 
and providing continuing education credits. 
Using my personal experience, today I am working with organizations 
to define their niche and empower them to develop their market and 
possess it. As their vision comes into focus and is defined, a wonderful 
thing happens. They find freedom to dream again because they are freed 
from distractions. When you have a clear vision, you are able to make 
your best decisions personally or corporately, because you will know 
what will be best for you or your business based on your vision. 
In 1993, I had the opportunity to start working with financial institutions. 
As I started working with advisors, licensed branch employees and 
program managers sharing financial planning principles, they began to 
teach me how things work within a financial institution. It has been 
interesting to observe the principle of reciprocity at work in business. 
As I have given to my clients I have always received more than I have 
given. 
These people have given birth to my new-favorite niche – working 
with financial institutions. Interestingly, the story of many financial 
institutions mirrors my personal story. Out of the struggle of the Great 
Depression many strong institutions arose. 
Recently, I have become a certified Zig Ziglar trainer and speaker, in 
order to provide hope and encouragement to the organizations with 
which we work. We are helping reinvigorate their organizations with 

TRANSFORM
352
a needs-based culture, empowering them to reach their potential. My 
strong business relationships in my defined niche have made it possible 
for me to discover what is important to my clients and to uncover 
their unspoken needs. They, like most organizations and most people, 
lose their passion and need to be reminded of their greatness. These 
institutions need to hear again and again what makes them great and 
how they achieved the success they enjoy.
After I earn my clients trust and they earn mine, I like to ask my financial 
institution clients:
•	 How do you plan on positioning your financial institution for the 
future?
•	 What enhanced services do you plan to provide that truly add 
value to your clients?
•	 What niche will you focus on to become more relevant in your 
communities?
These are the questions senior management wrestles with continually. I 
know helping my clients contemplate where they want to be would be 
useless if it weren’t for the gift life has given me to help and encourage 
them to make their vision a reality. When you finally commit to a worthy 
goal, you will get a vision. One of the best ways to commit to a vision is 
to begin with the end in mind and establish objectives that will help you 
reach your anticipated destination. Once your vision, along with your 
objectives and desired outcome, is in place, it becomes a valuable tool 
to guide and direct your focus. 
I have been told by counselors that I had a substantially high risk of 
becoming a dysfunctional alcoholic because of the abuse I experienced 
as a child. I am certain I could be stuck in an emotional prison today 
with a victim mentality. Fortunately, these potential atrocities have been 
avoided because of the goodness of others in my life giving me hope 
and encouragement. They have empowered me to give. Receiving help 
at every level in life and business equips you with the confidence and 
personal passion to give to others! Tragically, some will not ask for 
help or accept any help and they are doomed to be less than what they 
conceive because we all need the help of others. I have found when you 
develop a healthy habit of giving, you expand your capacity to receive 
all the goodness that life has to offer – enabling you to truly enjoy your 

353
CONTINUOUS TRANSFORMATION: A LIFELONG PROCESS
career and life.
From birth to now, I have been in the process of continuous transformation. 
I would like to summarize the specific principles of transformation 
woven throughout the content of this chapter that have influenced me 
that I hope will also be beneficial to you: 
•	 Be A Giver 
•	 Provide Hope And Encouragement To Others
•	 Practice Positive Self Talk
•	 Help Others Get What They Want In Life
•	 Don’t Allow Others To Crush Your Dreams
•	 Always Look For Opportunities In Obstacles
•	 Don’t Be Afraid To Ask For Help
•	 Find Your Niche
•	 Develop A Vision
Receive this message of hope from me and be encouraged. The 
negatives of life have hidden treasure and opportunity. Find them and 
take advantage of them. As you receive, give. I am giving because I 
have been given. I am a receiver who is continuing to grow and to be 
transformed. As my mentor Zig Ziglar would say…“And I will see you 
over the top!”

CHAPTER 39
NEMESIS CONQUERED, 
GOAL ACCOMPLISHED  
AND TRANSFORMATION  
IN PROGRESS!
BY TONY SIDIO
I am going places I have never been.  
Places that I have only dreamed about!  
~ Tony Sidio
Your life can and should be an adventure! If not, begin the 
Transformation of your life as I have.
On January 27, 2013, I finally acknowledged the little voice that had 
been prompting me for several years to make major changes in my life. 
It was time to decide what I really wanted to do, have and be. It was 
time to Transform my life. For more than 19 years, I have earned my 
living in Information Technology—initially as an employee, then as a 
business owner.
Transformation is a process, not a destination. Why should you invest 
the time and effort into Transforming your life? If you want more than 
you have now, you must become more. You become more through 
Transformation.

TRANSFORM
356
Here are 3 recent scenes from my ongoing Transformation that may 
help you understand what can be accomplished. Later, I will tell you 
how I accomplished this so you can Transform your life, too.
Scene 1
I am at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City. I just rode the Shuttle 
(Subway) from Grand Central Station to Times Square, in my Tuxedo. 
It is a rainy Friday afternoon and I knew that getting a cab would be a 
challenge. So, my best friend, Ken, and I opted for the Shuttle. Armed 
with red umbrellas borrowed from The Grand Hyatt, we quickly and 
easily made our way from the subway station to The Hard Rock Cafe. 
Soon, my name will be called to receive an award on stage followed by 
a Red Carpet Interview.
Scene 2
I am at the historic Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California. We have 
been in great seminars for two days, and it is now time for a quick 
change into my tux. I then make my way to the very room that hosted 
the first Academy Awards. Soon, I will have dinner with many great new 
friends. My name will be called to receive an award on stage followed 
by a Red Carpet Interview. Do you see a pattern developing here?
Scene 3
It is January 8, 2014 as I cruise north along the beautiful California 
Coast between San Diego and LA on Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner. As I 
settle in for the ride, the announcer says “It is 80 degrees in LA” and 
several things occur to me. 
I have been on an especially beautiful ride for the past 9 months. I co-
authored a Best-Selling hardcover book, Against the Grain with the 
legendary Brian Tracy. It launched on Amazon.com on September 5, 
2013. It was an immediate best-seller in 5 categories. I earned the right 
to permanently precede my name with: “Best-Selling Author” Tony 
Sidio. It gets better...
I received The Quilly® Award from the National Academy of Best-
Selling Authors® in Hollywood. Think “Oscar.” Think “Emmy.” 
Think “Grammy” for Best-Selling Authors. The Quilly® is a 14-inch 
commemorative gold statue that has been crafted by the same artisans 
who sculpt the Oscars and Emmy Awards. Quilly® in hand, I immediately 

357
NEMESIS CONQUERED, GOAL ACCOMPLISHED AND TRANSFORMATION IN PROGRESS!
proceeded to my Red Carpet Video Interview. This Black Tie affair 
included a Party and an After Party. 
I met Jack Canfield, Best-Selling Author of Chicken Soup for the Soul 
renown, The Success Principles and many others. I had inadvertently 
left my sport coat in my cousin’s car and I was embarrassed to be at the 
photo shoot without it. As I briefly relayed the story to Jack, he looked at 
me, smiled and said, “You look great just as you are.” He is a class act!
There were about 150 Best-Selling Authors in attendance, and I am 
amazed at the quality, character and depth of those authors. Many of 
them are now new friends all over the world. 
I received a Writer’s Expy® Award at the National Association of Experts, 
Writers and Speakers™ First Annual Expy® Awards in New York City on 
April 4, 2014. The Expy® Awards were founded to honor experts around 
the world for their contribution to education, enlightenment and the 
advancement of business and life. The Writer’s Expy®, like The Quilly®, 
is handmade by the same artisans who make the Oscars. Brian Tracy 
was inducted into the Speakers Hall of Fame at this Black Tie Golden 
Gala. Of course, we had our Red Carpet interviews, too!
Have you ever had lunch with a Rockstar? I did. I had a great lunch in 
NYC with Steve McCarty and his lovely wife, Trish. Steve is a legendary 
recording artist/singer/songwriter/guitararist who co-wrote “Fly Like 
an Eagle” with Steve Miller. Trish is CEO and founder of Starshine 
Academy in Phoenix, Arizona. Starshine Academy is a special school 
for Barrio kids, which has grown into a community where the parents 
and even grandparents can live, too. (Trish has also written Chapter 68 
in this book!)
Many of my Best-Selling Author friends from Hollywood were also at 
the EXPYs, as well as many new friends from around the globe.
Now, I don’t know about you, but, as you can see above, I am having a 
fantastic time traveling around the country, meeting great people who 
are changing the world. My transformed life may not be the life you 
would choose for yourself. However, I believe that you can transform 
your life into whatever it is that you would really enjoy doing, just as I 
have. What would your transformed life look like?

TRANSFORM
358
If you want something you’ve never had, you must  
be willing to do something you’ve never done.  
~ Thomas Jefferson
Do not misunderstand. I love technology. I love my clients and fellow 
Chamber Members. I have been very involved in my local Chamber 
of Commerce (my story begins on page 377, Against the Grain, my 
Best-Selling Book with Brian Tracy). My life has been rewarding and 
fun, but the little voice inside me kept demanding more. “You have 
served the business community here well for many years. You helped 
implement the changes you believed needed to be made. Now trust that 
others will keep things moving in the proper direction. You must seek 
new challenges, new opportunities to serve. It is time to do more and 
be more. It is time to take inspired action and become what you were 
always meant to be. To make a bigger impact and help more people, you 
need to perform on a national stage.”
You should also know that I have maintained a secret identity for many 
years. I am well known as an IT company business owner. However, 
since my college days, I have studied, practiced and taught personal 
development. I have also been on a personal quest to learn how to break 
through the barriers that keep many people stuck and prevent them 
from achieving their goals. I have learned many ways to help people 
get unstuck (break through their barriers to success) through traditional 
coaching techniques and the latest in neuroscience. I have used this 
knowledge to Transform my life. I can help you transform your life too.
So on January 27, 2013, I committed to becoming a Best-Selling Author, 
Professional Speaker and Coach. I had no idea how I would become a 
Best-Selling Author, but I was committed to do it in 2013.
One of the things I learned many years ago is that nothing happens 
with a goal until you make a commitment. You must write down the 
goal, be very clear and specific about what you want to accomplish. 
Establish a definite time limit to accomplish it. Then you must commit 
to accomplish the goal. 
Are you committed or are you interested? One of my friends and mentors, 
John Assaraf, two times a New York Times Best-Selling Author, asks 
that question. The difference he explains is, if you are interested, you 
will only do what is convenient in working toward that goal. If you are 

359
NEMESIS CONQUERED, GOAL ACCOMPLISHED AND TRANSFORMATION IN PROGRESS!
committed, you will do whatever it takes. When you are committed to 
an outcome, there will be no excuses, no stories, and no reasons not to 
accomplish it. You will achieve your goal! 
What happens next? Frequently, all hell breaks loose. Yes, every possible 
thing that can happen to delay or derail you working toward your goal 
happens. Another mentor, Tony Robbins, describes it as “your nemesis 
shows up” like in a novel. You are the hero; your nemesis is the villain 
who stands in your way at every turn. He is usually a very powerful 
nemesis, not some weakling you can handily defeat. The bigger the goal, 
the bigger your nemesis. Yes, you will have to work smart and hard to 
defeat him and accomplish your goal! What you may not realize, and 
probably will not appreciate in the heat of the battle, is that your nemesis 
is necessary. He makes you stronger. He makes you earn that goal. He 
makes the adventure more challenging, yes, but also more interesting! 
The other thing that happens simultaneously, and you had better be 
paying close attention, is that while you are frantically battling your 
nemesis, everything you need to accomplish your goal begins to show 
up. The people you need, the resources you need, the money you need, 
everything you need starts showing up. Bob Proctor from The Secret 
might say that you are attracting all of this to you through the “Law of 
Attraction.” Tony Robins might say that all of these things have been 
there all along, but you did not notice them before you set your goal. 
Once you focus your thoughts, you activate your “Reticular Activating 
System.” Your “Reticular Activating System” (RAS) directs your 
attention to specific tools, resources, people etc. that will help you 
accomplish your goal.
Law of Attraction? RAS? How it works may not be as important as 
the fact that it does work! Just be sure to pay close attention, because 
the resources you need may appear in unusual or innovative ways. If 
you can step back, and briefly look at your situation objectively, from a 
distance, in the heat of the battle, you may learn to appreciate and even 
enjoy the whole process of accomplishing your big goal! I have.
March 19, 2013, was one of the best days of my life and also one of 
the most difficult days. It was difficult because that morning we had 
to say our final goodbyes to our beautiful Bijou. She was 12 years old, 
half Boxer and half Coon Hound. She never knew that she was a dog. 

TRANSFORM
360
She thought she was a princess, and we let her believe that. In fact, we 
encouraged it. She had not been able to eat for 5 days, and the vet said 
her time with us was up. I still get tears in my eyes when I think of her. 
We miss you very much, Bijou!
That afternoon I signed a deal with my new agency to co-author a 
hardcover book, Against the Grain, with the legendary Brian Tracy and 
other leading experts. The book launched on September 5, 2013, and 
was an immediate Best-Seller in 5 Categories. Nemesis Conquered, 
Goal Accomplished & Transformation In Progress!
Earlier I mentioned neuroscience, which is the study of the nervous 
system. I follow neuroscientific research that focuses on understanding 
the human brain and how it regulates the body and behavior. Neuroscience 
is teaching us better, faster ways to train our brains and break through 
our barriers.
 It is only through the study of neuroscience and the contacts and 
relationships I developed that I finally found effective ways to help 
people change their internal self-image. Why is that important? Our 
self-image is a primary reason that we all get stuck. For example, the 
only way to double, triple or ten times your income is to change your 
self-image.
I 
combine 
time-tested 
coaching 
with 
neuroscience 
in 
my 
Transformational Coaching. I currently help business owners, high-
performing entrepreneurs, executives, leaders, professionals and sales 
professionals double, triple or even ten times their business revenues 
while reducing the number of hours they work. I also help individuals 
who are stuck at certain levels, get unstuck, double or triple their income 
and reimagine their lives.

BE YOUR OWN DOG
CHAPTER 40
BE YOUR OWN DOG
BY LINDA WORRELL
When our daughter was young and struggling with the typical “growing 
up” angst, her father would advise her to “be your own dog.” He told her 
not to live her life as others would have her live it, but to determine what 
she wanted and why. He told her not to believe what others believed but 
to be true to what she thought and felt. He told her not to worry about 
what others thought of her, and that it was a blessing not to have to 
please other people.
He was a Renaissance man before that idea was mainstream. He did not 
believe in the traditional ways of living and working. He did not define 
success as others in our social group did. Neither did he care. He did not 
want important titles, fancy cars and expensive clothes. He was happy 
being alone and communing with nature. Although he was a numbers 
man by trade, he was a poet and musician in his heart. The advice he 
gave our daughter was spot on—I only wish that I had followed that 
advice also. I would have saved myself a lot of time and disappointment.
He always encouraged us not to settle for what other people expected 
of us but to spread our wings and fly listening only to that voice inside. 
That is a hard thing to do. It is human nature for the people we love 
and trust to share their ideas on how to live a successful life. However, 
more often than not, they define success differently than we do. But to 
challenge “group think” takes courage. It also requires that we really 
know what we want and why. For one to live a bit differently, to want 
more or different opportunities requires a willingness to walk alone at 

TRANSFORM
364
least part of the time. It requires a commitment to be all that one can be 
on one’s own timetable and for reasons that are important only to the 
one involved. Living like that takes a commitment of time and energy 
and a willingness to do the work to stay on track to what is true for 
oneself.
When I was a younger woman, I spent far more time planning a two-
week vacation to California and Hawaii than I spent planning my life! 
I was not willing to take the time and to do the work to determine what 
I wanted my life to stand for and why. I set goals and I made plans, 
but I did not prepare a life map or a life plan so that at the end of my 
life I would be reaching a certain destination. Apparently, I was going 
nowhere!
Without developing and following a plan, life tends to take you first 
in one direction and then in another. Pretty soon, you feel a bit like a 
lightly tethered boat riding on the movement of the tides. Like the boat, 
you are only going to move so far in any one direction, but the constant 
movement does tend to take one off course. The next new idea, the next 
great opportunity or the next “have to” that someone proclaims uses up 
your valuable energy and time.
Constantly shifting focus and direction is not sustainable over the long 
term without creating stress and other negative emotions. It ultimately 
does damage to one’s self-confidence. We can maintain someone else’s 
idea of what is good, what is right and what is successful for only so 
long. Ultimately, one begins to feel out of sorts, a bit depressed or just 
plain blue for no apparent reason.
Fortunately, when we act in ways that are inconsistent with what we 
want and need, our body and mind provide us the insight that we need 
to get back into alignment.
I found that to be true in my life. Here is an example. I would accept a job 
or a responsibility that did not support my mission in life. Even though 
I was not yet clear on the terms of my mission, I knew that the job or 
project I had just committed to did not feel all that great. But because I 
was not truly listening to the warning signals, I would try to reframe it 
so that it would fit but inevitably there was always a disconnect. I would 
try to sell myself on the advantages of taking on the project but it still 
didn’t feel good. I would start to get discouraged, upset and dissatisfied. 

365
BE YOUR OWN DOG
I did not have the joy, the energy or the passion that I had when I was 
doing something that really was consistent with my purpose in life. So 
in effect, I had helped move someone else forward, and my own soul 
received little or nothing in return.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
To live the kind of life we were meant to live, we need to figure out 
why we are here and what we are supposed to do. Have you ever asked 
yourself those questions? Have you ever wondered what your talents 
and gifts are? 
I would venture to say that most of us have asked ourselves those 
questions and that many of us are struggling with some of them right 
now. It has nothing to do with education, race, age or intelligence. It has 
to do with awareness and focus—awareness of who we are and what we 
want, and the ability to focus on achieving it.
We are born knowing exactly what we want and what we don’t want. We 
know when we are hungry and want food, when we are sleepy and want 
rest and when we are frightened and want to be held and loved. Pretty 
straightforward, isn’t it? However, we soon learn we are not necessarily 
going to get what we want, and sometimes we will get what we do not 
want. We learn quickly which battles to fight and which not to fight. We 
also learn to keep some of our thoughts to ourselves and are taught to 
listen to our elders because they have more experience and know more 
than we do.
There is some truth to that, but really nobody knows us as well as 
we know ourselves, even when we are struggling to figure out who 
we are. Fortunately, we have an internal positioning system, an IPS, 
very similar to a GPS in an automobile, and when we get off track our 
IPS alerts us. If we are overwhelmed or moving too quickly without 
thinking or feeling, we may not automatically pick up on the message, 
but ultimately we figure it out. Sometimes it takes a major crisis to stop 
us in our tracks, but we usually realize something is not quite right. We 
are not as successful at work, we are constantly at odds with the people 
in our life or we are always worried about making the car payment or the 
mortgage on time. Those are some of the alerts that we receive telling us 
it is time to reposition and make some different choices.

TRANSFORM
366
DO YOUR CHOICES MESH?
Even though we may know what we want to do, we oftentimes make 
choices that are inconsistent with our needs and desires. We do that 
because we want to be liked, we want to fit in or we think it is what 
we have to do to be successful. We also do those things because other 
people tell us to grow up and accept our responsibilities. We are told that 
what we want to do would be a great hobby but not a job and it won’t 
pay the bills. Fearful people tell us that we need to get a good job with a 
good company and keep our nose to the grindstone until retirement. We 
think we can’t possibly do what we want because that is not the way the 
world works and that is not what happens when you are an adult. Adults 
are supposed to get jobs, raise families and stay out of trouble. 
Well, what if that premise is not quite right? What if we are supposed 
to do what we want to do because it is consistent with our gifts and 
talents? What if we are not all supposed to have 2.3 children, work 
for one employer for at least 10 years, wear certain clothes, belong to 
certain clubs and like certain people?
We come into this world with very specific gifts and talents that are 
unlike anyone else’s gifts and talents. We have not earned them and we 
have not asked for them—we simply were given them. They are like 
fingerprints and no two are alike. 
Because we were born with them and did not have to struggle to realize 
them, sometimes we take them for granted. We do not even realize what 
a gift they are, not only to us, but also to the rest of the world. What if 
we are provided the opportunity to use our gifts and talents in unique 
and wonderful ways to bring value and joy to others? What if, in doing 
so, we lived a life of energy, excitement and pure bliss?
WHAT IF?
What if you could spend the rest of your life doing work you love? What 
if you could live joyfully? There is always a way to get what you need. 
We oftentimes do not consider the possibility that we have options to 
work and live in ways that soothe our soul and bring us joy. We think 
that we are too old to make the change, not capable of doing anything 
differently, or that our families and friends will not support our dream.

If I told you that you do have options and that you could live a better 
life, would you be willing to try? It is not impossible but neither is it 
easy. It does require some work to dig deep and understand who you 
really are and what you really want. It is not about your family, your 
friends, your associates or your dog. IT IS ALL ABOUT YOU!!
So, are you ready to get started?
DETERMINE WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT
Take a minute to prepare your mind. Sit in a quiet room alone. Give 
thanks for your life and the opportunity that this journey will provide. 
Open up your mind to what you want and need. Shut out all of the other 
voices and distractions that are sending less than supportive messages.
Grab a paper and pencil and consider the following questions. Take 
the time to contemplate each question individually, completely, before 
moving on to the next one:
• Who am I and what do I like, dislike and need in my life? Why?
• When am I at my best?
• When am I the most excited, energetic and joyful?
• What do my friends depend upon me for?
• At the end of my life, what do I want to have accomplished? Why?
• What do I like about myself and want to share with others?
• What does my dream life look like? What am I doing?  
How am I living? What am I wearing? Describe in detail,  
as the details tell a story.
• What are my strengths?
• What about me is unique?
• Who do I admire and why? 
• What does success look like?
• What does significance look like?
The answers to these questions will guide you in determining what you 
want to do and how you want to live. Continue pondering the answers 
and rank what the most important things are to you. If you need more 

TRANSFORM
368
input, there are some wonderful assessments on the market to help you 
further clarify your passion.
DETERMINE NEXT STEPS
Once you have determined what it is you want to do, write down five 
action steps that you must take immediately to move forward. Do not 
worry about developing a full plan at this point. You can do that later. 
Go to the next step NOW.
TAKE ACTION
Take action, right now!! It is important to take action so the dream takes 
on a life of its own. Do one thing on your list and then follow it up with 
the next item on the list. If you do not take action immediately, your 
dream will fade into the “Someday I will . . .” category – where dreams 
go to die. It is important to get energy behind the dream to move it 
forward. Completing one step—no matter how small—validates your 
ability to follow through on your plan.
RELAX
Now, relax and let the magic begin. Once you put your dream out there, 
determine your next steps and take action, the magic starts. The universe 
conspires to help you. You just need to believe and remove all barriers 
from your mind. Keep thinking about doing that activity that brings 
such joy. See yourself in your mind performing the task, feeling good 
about your achievement and being grateful for the opportunities. You 
will see it is quite possible to be your own dog! I am excited for you and 
hope to hear about you and your success.

VOYAGE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR—ACHIEVING YOUR DREAMS AND LIVING YOUR PURPOSE
CHAPTER 41
VOYAGE OF  
AN ENTREPRENEUR 
—ACHIEVING YOUR  
DREAMS AND LIVING  
YOUR PURPOSE
BY JULIO ZELAYA, PhD
What is your greatest dream in life? If you had the opportunity to focus 
on the one thing you love doing in life, what would that be?
At first glance, they might seem like two simple questions, but upon 
closer observation – according to global statistics – we find a surprising 
reality. Sixty percent of all people are depressed in their jobs, feeling 
trapped, doing things day in and day out that they don’t enjoy. So what 
is it that keeps us engaging in the purpose God has entrusted us with? 
How do we make our business and our jobs something we are passionate 
about? These are vital questions we need to answer.
During the last World Business Forum I attended in NY, I was surprised 
to see that the only speech receiving a standing ovation was the one 
by Nando Parrado, survivor of the 1972 Andes airplane accident. His 
conclusion was, “We must have a purpose in life that goes beyond 
just making money.” In addition, I also recall reading an article in the 

TRANSFORM
372
Harvard Business Review titled, “How will you measure your life?” The 
conclusion was clear: We are living in a world where external abundance 
is keeping us from living a life full of purpose. We are immersed in a 
culture full of ‘having’ but not of ‘becoming’. We spend little to no time 
meditating on our priorities in life. And to make things worse, we spend 
time criticizing others instead of answering the question of who we 
really are and what our purpose really is. Rarely do we ask ourselves, 
“What can I do to improve my quality of life?” …and, “What am I doing 
to have a positive impact on the lives of others?”
On more than one occasion, I’ve asked people what their priority is 
in life, mostly getting either God or family as a response. However 
upon inquiring about how much time they invest into each of these, 
never if ever do I get an answer different from “very little” or the ever-
famous, “…don’t have time because of work.” So then what can our 
priorities really be if our answers aren’t as congruous as we thought? 
We state one thing but tend to do another, myself included. I’d be lying 
to say that I always make strategically correct decisions for my life. 
Yet acknowledging this disconnect, facing up to it and doing something 
about it, is the change that could set us once again on the path towards 
reaching our dreams.
A second strategically-foundational premise is that your product is 
a direct result of your ability to measure things. It’s vital to set key 
performance indicators (KPI’s) and formal accountability systems in 
one’s life. If we constantly measure our business’ EBITDA, sales and 
turnover rate to determine our company’s performance level, then why 
not employ similar measuring techniques for our lives? I was amazed 
by something Clayton Christiansen wrote in his article: How will you 
measure your life? – “God is going to measure my life not by the amount 
of dollars I make, but by how many lives I touch.” It’s really not about 
prominence, status or achievements, but rather about helping others 
develop better lives. How is God going to measure my life, my family, 
my friends, my colleagues and society as a whole? By the life-strategy 
I choose to live by to help make this world and those around me better.
As I meditate upon this whole life strategy to help reach our dreams, 
I can’t help but remember a few experiences from my own life. I was 
about eight when I mixed a number of ingredients in a jar and labeled 
it “Mediopetril.” Needless to say it was a foul-tasting concoction made 

373
VOYAGE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR—ACHIEVING YOUR DREAMS AND LIVING YOUR PURPOSE
up of: Vaseline, colorants, play-dough, water and other items I found 
around the house. I remember telling my parents, “I’ve invented a cure-
it-all for everything.” Back then my Dad worked for a pharmaceutical 
company and I asked him for an appointment at his company to present 
my idea. He asked me about performance testing and I answered, “I 
tried it on my turtles and they all died, but that’s just because it’s not 
designed for animals. Can I have a meeting at your company to explain 
it to them?” Just picture the scene - it was a critical point in my life. 
Without a second thought my Father assured me, “You can count on 
that meeting but you’ll need to be better prepared.” My Mom showed 
her support as well.
Days went by and every time my Dad came home I’d ask him about the 
meeting. Then a few weeks later it came, my Dad says, “tomorrow’s 
the day; I got you a meeting with the general managers.” With all the 
excitement an eight-year-old can muster, I put my suit on, readied my 
dreadful concoction, gathered some drawings I had made and went with 
my Dad to work. And just like he said, there was a group of managers 
waiting for me in the board room. I went through my presentation 
without a single one of them chiding or looking down on me. No doubt 
my Dad had prepped them ahead of time. By the end of the presentation, 
one of them took their watch off and handed it to me together with a 
book he had gotten from his briefcase. And I’ll never forget the words 
he said for they forever marked my life, “I’m giving you this watch as 
an initial capital investment. Follow your dream and read this book The 
Greatest Salesman in the World, and don’t stop preparing yourself.” 
They were basically saying that I was headed in the right direction; 
but that everything was a matter of perfecting the product and if I 
was consistent there was no doubt I would reach my goal. Because of 
this assessment, failure never crossed my mind. Later on that day, we 
celebrated that important business meeting with my parents.
Sometime later when I was ten, in my home city of Guatemala, I 
was blessed with being chosen to be—“Mayor for a Day.” It was a 
competition where children would qualify due to their grades and 
merits. In my case, thanks to my teachers and parents submitting me as a 
candidate—I WON!! After the experience, I thought to myself, “I’d like 
to dedicate my life to teaching and repaying all the good they’ve sown 
into me.” I recall that as the first thought connected to my life’s dream of 
impacting the lives of many. But I didn’t just leave it at the declaration 

TRANSFORM
374
phase, because even at that young age, I started developing a long-term 
plan that included preparation time and goal achievement. 
I’m sure everyone can bring to mind events that marked their lives, 
because they either allowed you to believe in your abilities or to doubt 
them. Why don’t you reminisce on them once again and measure how 
they’ve affected your outcome so far. Understanding those events that 
have molded us greatly affects our outlook on the world, and on what 
we believe we can achieve. My goal here is to restore your ability to 
dream once again, and break any limits keeping you from achieving 
whatever you set your mind to. 
Now, how do we recover our ability to dream? Here are five key steps 
to get you started:
1. Stockdale’s Paradox. Bear in mind there must be a balance between 
faith and discipline. It’s vital to believe in a better future and cultivate 
our spirit for it; but at the same time it’s also imperative to face the 
facts and work hard right now. Success isn’t a chance event but a 
direct result of preparation and opportunity. Now ask yourself: Do 
you really have faith in your dreams? Are you really doing all you can 
to prepare and work hard for them?
2. View opportunities where others see problems. Everything in life 
can be seen in two ways: as a problem or an opportunity. We must 
learn to develop an optimistic and positive approach to make the most 
out of every moment. Is traffic horrible this morning? Then view it 
as a wonderful opportunity to grow and develop through teachings 
and audio-books. Remember everything in life is always a new 
opportunity.
3. Dreams are personal. What works for some people probably won’t 
work for others. Beware of destroying other people’s dreams. Learn 
to ask and give advice that builds and motivates, rather than simply 
giving excuses to conform and settle for the way things are.
4. Children believe everything. Refresh your way of seeing life. 
Become like a child to dream once again, all the while being a grown-
up that works hard to achieve what you set your heart to do. This is 
the best combination.

375
VOYAGE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR—ACHIEVING YOUR DREAMS AND LIVING YOUR PURPOSE
5. A model is worth more than a thousand words. Meditate on how 
to become a better role model for young lives to imitate. We have the 
responsibility of being dream builders. Meditate on this: How do you 
talk to your children? As the line from a famous Latin American song 
goes, “Lord I want to be more like you, because my children want to 
be more like me.”
No matter if it was a past experience or you’re just recently discovering 
it, but all of us can experience a moment in life when we discover 
something that impassions us. In my case, it was a personal epiphany 
that revealed my teaching vocation. Others discover their passion 
for singing, for writing, for researching, for working in politics. The 
possibilities are endless. The truth of the matter is that many times we 
discover what our passion in life is, but we don’t take the necessary 
steps to make that entrepreneurship a reality. 
By entrepreneurship I’m not necessarily referring to opening up your 
own business, but about adopting a lifestyle focused on making the 
most of opportunities that come your way. It’s about developing your 
potential and adding value to your family and community. All of us are 
entrepreneurs to a certain degree, and we have an unlimited potential to 
create and bring to life ideas from the abstract to the concrete.
How do we go about developing an entrepreneurial lifestyle? 
1. Discover your purpose. What do you believe is your goal in life? 
What do you consider is the mission you alone can bring to fruition 
in this world? There are no simple answers to these questions, but 
by taking into account other factors you’ll probably notice certain 
significant experiences designed to lead you into your purpose. 
Here are some additional questions to reflect on: What is something 
you would like to change in the world? What social issues greatly 
unsettle you? What types of news bother you? What would you like 
to improve in the world? What would you like to accomplish before 
passing away? What would you do in life if you were guaranteed 
success? There are no limits. You can be successful in whatever 
undertaking you choose. What do you want your legacy to be in this 
world? This last question is pivotal because it sets you apart from the 
rest. Stop trying to reach someone else’s purpose and start seeking to 
fulfill your own.

TRANSFORM
376
2. Discover your passion. What do you enjoy doing more than anything 
else? What challenges do you like to take on regardless of the hurdles 
they might include? When do you feel most enthused and fulfilled? 
What do you lament in society? Does poverty make you upset? Does 
corruption or negativity get on your nerves?
3. Discover your talent. What areas are you uniquely skilled for? 
Where do you have a personal competitive advantage? Everyone has 
something they’re better at than others. What is that special talent in 
you? Upon discovering it you’ll notice that it goes hand-in-hand with 
your passion as well. If you like music, then you’ll probably have 
a talent along those lines—be it in song or some other implicit area 
such as being a talent agent. 
4. Discover how to make your purpose, passion and talent profitable. 
Every entrepreneurial undertaking must be profitable. And I’m not 
solely referring to money or profits but about making it sustainable.
5. Act on it. The last step in this entrepreneurship model is the most 
important of all. Many times people discover their purpose, their 
passion, their talents, and may even have an idea of how to make it 
profitable, yet still leave it at the planning stage. This is usually the 
stage where all your fears start manifesting. We start asking ourselves 
questions such as: “Am I really ready? Is it really worth the risk? Do 
I really have what it takes?” Now, I’m not saying that you need to get 
up tomorrow morning, quit your job and focus solely on what you 
enjoy doing; but what I am saying is that you need to gradually act on 
it to make it a reality. 
In order to encourage you to take the first step, allow me to share a 
practical, real-life scenario:
When I turned thirty I got the best gift I could have ever received – I 
got involved as a volunteer with a group of adults that had lost their 
sight later in life. When sharing with them about this entrepreneurial 
lifestyle and reaching for their dreams, they gave me a lesson I won’t 
soon forget!
The majority of them were new to the business community, offering 
their services in mesotherapy and reflexology. When going about the 
exercise of reexamining what they really had to offer as a business and 

377
VOYAGE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR—ACHIEVING YOUR DREAMS AND LIVING YOUR PURPOSE
the essence of their services, I was blown away by the depth of their 
answers. One of them said, “I sell peace of mind.” Another continued, 
“I sell love.” Others would smile and say, “I sell them the opportunity 
to get to know God.” I finished that workshop with this sense of faith 
exploding within me and saying to them, “Thank you for giving me one 
of the greatest lessons in life. For true vision isn’t in the eyes, but in the 
mind and in the heart.”
What are you really doing to make your life meaningful today? How 
do you view your job? As a business, what are you really selling? 
Entrepreneurship is about focusing on personal change and seeing life 
through the lens of possibility, not imitation. We must first set our mind 
on BECOMING, then on DOING and lastly on HAVING! Investing 
into our own purpose and personal development will provoke us to stop 
seeing things with our natural eyes and start seeing them through the 
eyes of faith.
If we just start envisioning in our hearts and minds all that we could 
actually accomplish for others, for our family, at our jobs and for our 
country, we will be the likes of those anonymous heroes restoring the 
dreams of our fellow men.
What are you doing today to make your dreams a reality?

THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE: MODERN DAY HOUSE CALLS® 
CHAPTER 42
THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE: 
MODERN DAY HOUSE CALLS®  
A SOLUTION TO  
MAJOR PROBLEMS IN  
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY 
“THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE PRACTICED HERE  
TODAY AT A.P.P.L.E. MEDICAL HOMEHEALTH”
BY KENNETH ALBRECHT, M.D.
Please let me introduce myself. I am Kenneth E. Albrecht. M.D. I am 
an internal medicine physician with 13 years of training. I am proud to 
say I obtained my Internal Medicine degree at one of the top 10 medical 
schools in the country, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
I am amazed at the fact that I am a doctor who actually makes house 
calls; let alone making house calls back in my home town, Crystal Lake, 
Illinois. I actually started my medical career in this town as a hospital 
orderly during my junior year of high school. That was over 30 years 
ago. 
Through all my years as a physician, my colleagues have always referred 
to me as being “futuristic and ahead of the pack.” I have always been 
referred to as a forward thinker and doer. Ultimately, I was known to be 

TRANSFORM
382
the guy to “make things happen.” I was known as the most efficient and 
the most organized guy in helping to make things happen in medicine 
and get things done.
My personal goal has always been to find ways to make healthcare as 
personable and as cost-effective as possible. This was never so true 
than in the development of A.P.P.L.E. Medical Homehealth, otherwise 
known as Modern Day House Calls® (MDHC), a homehealth system of 
community-based healthcare delivery. A.P.P.L.E. stands for Associated 
Professionals for Personal Life Enhancement. In this chapter, I am going 
to reintroduce the concept of doctors making house calls.
My challenge was to see if house calls could be a viable personalized, 
high-quality cost-effective form of healthcare delivery in America. I 
have found that Modern Day House Calls is a solution to many of the 
problems that exist in today’s healthcare system. Plus, I wanted to see 
if I could create a reproducible form of healthcare delivery known as 
Modern Day House Calls® throughout America. 
WHAT MAKES A.P.P.L.E. HOMEHEALTH SO SPECIAL?
The answer is found when you see what we do and how we do it and the 
results we have achieved.
We at A.P.P.L.E. Medical have developed a process of delivering 
home healthcare as a solution to many of the problems that currently 
exist in America. Our mission is to bring A.P.P.L.E.’s state of the art 
healthcare to patients in their individual homes as well as in community 
environments, such as independent, supportive or assisted, or even the 
corporate workplace.
WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON PATIENTS AND  
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ALIKE? 
Everyone is searching for that healthcare solution that will bring a more 
positive and cost-effective outcome than what currently exists in the 
healthcare system. The goal, according to A.P.P.L.E. philosophy, is to 
help each patient become as fully functional and alive as possible. This, 
of course, depends upon on each patient’s desire, their personality, and 
in most cases consistent wishes of that patient’s family.

383
THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE: MODERN DAY HOUSE CALLS® 
We found that our level of care has a tremendous impact on the whole 
life spectrum of patients and their families. It is profound, even to me 
as a healthcare provider. For example, patients and families tell us that, 
unlike many other doctors, we at A.P.P.L.E. always present all diagnostic 
and treatment options to patients and their families. We educate and 
help patients pick and choose what is appropriate for them, once again 
based on patient personality. I have found that patient personality can be 
one of the greatest limiting factors in healthcare. 
This is why I say to each patient and family when we are together 
on location, “You never need to do what I say, but I always have to 
recommend what is best.” That is what is expected of me. However, I 
always present multiple options and help patients pick and choose what 
they think is best of all the options possible. The way we do this is 
drastically different than most doctors. I only say this because patients 
tell me so. It’s the “A.P.P.L.E. difference,” and they like it!
Here is another example of the A.P.P.L.E. difference. You can be an 
average doc and deliver regular medical care, which can have average 
impact on a person’s life. However, we at A.P.P.L.E. have learned the 
ways to deliver a fantastic level of healthcare that has a fantastic impact 
on a patient’s whole life spectrum, level of human existence, general 
feeling of well being, and performance both mentally and physically. 
The question is, how do you bring all these kinds of issues together and 
make healthcare happen in a patient’s home, let alone on location in the 
community? This personalized approach, as you might imagine, is a 
system design that required a tremendous amount of development. 
It is a protocol at A.P.P.L.E. that I developed through a process that we 
call, “organized flexibility.” This is the key to what we do and how we 
do it that makes A.P.P.L.E. so special to our patients and families. 
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFICE-BASED  
MEDICINE VS. MODERN DAY HOUSE CALLS®?
First you have to ask yourself, to what extent am I qualified to answer 
the above questions. I have been an office-based physician for many 
years; however, in the last 12 years, I have probably done more house 
calls than any other physician in America. So, based on my experience 
and what we have accomplished in A.P.P.L.E. to date, let alone having 

TRANSFORM
384
seen what seems like nearly a million patients in my career, I can tell 
you with certainty that there is a big difference between office-based 
medical care versus A.P.P.L.E.’s Modern Day House Calls®.
For you to fully appreciate the difference, let me tell you my story as an 
A.P.P.L.E. Medical Modern Day House Call Doctor®. You will see the 
contrast of how things are being done currently in medicine versus how 
we practice medicine in A.P.P.L.E. as a future benchmark model for the 
healthcare industry. 
WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF HEALTHCARE?
A.P.P.L.E. was built to leave a legacy. A.P.P.L.E. was built as a futuristic 
model of personalized healthcare delivery for America. Ask yourself 
this: Where do you think the future of health care “should go”? In 
contrast, “where do you think the future of healthcare is going? What do 
you think the government is wanting to see happen? What do you think 
insurance companies and Medicare would like to see happen?
The stakeholders in medicine, those who make money in medicine, 
absolutely want to shift the increase in healthcare cost to your pocket 
book. Stakeholders want you to pay for the inefficiency in medicine. 
They want to shift the increasing cost to the consumer and pay all 
providers alike less money for the healthcare they provide.
That being said, if you are going to stay in the game of healthcare and 
plan on winning, the following needs to happen. Healthcare providers 
have to deliver the most efficient, cost-effective impacting healthcare 
possible. Baby boomer patients, as the consumers of healthcare, do and 
will increasingly demand and expect the same.
Having been an advocate of the above during my entire 30-plus years, 
I feel we at A.P.P.L.E. have discovered innovative ways everyone can 
win in this healthcare game. We have developed a system, a benchmark 
model of healthcare delivery that is most unique, and we have already 
proven that it works! 
Here is an example of what I mean: When people ask me what kind of 
a doctor I am, I always take a little pause to get their attention and then 
say, “I am the kind of doctor most patients would like to have.” I then 
wait to see what they think of my response. Invariably they say, “Why is 
that?” My response is always the same, “I help patients become healthy, 

385
THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE: MODERN DAY HOUSE CALLS® 
wealthy and happy through a personalized approach to healthcare.” In 
particular I say, “I am an A.P.P.L.E Medical Modern Day House Call 
Doctor®. 
Not only are they surprised by the fact that we do house calls, they are 
very surprised by the high-quality personalized kind of care they receive 
while we are on location. And it’s not just me, I always have a fantastic 
nurse, who helps “to help make things happen.” What is interesting 
about the A.P.P.L.E. solution is that it does not require anyone from the 
government, insurance companies or other stakeholders to do anything 
different than they are currently doing. We are working within the 
system as it is currently structured, while doing our twist on things to 
get it right. Getting it right means cost-effective delivery and a satisfied 
patient. At days end, our design leaves both providers and patients alike 
with a great sense of satisfaction of having done a job well done with 
an impact on a patient’s and family’s life that goes beyond expectation. 
A.P.P.L.E. is a community-based, workplace-based model of Modern 
Day House Calls®. This is a transformation that many patients are going 
to need. Patients and stakeholders are expecting this, but I believe few 
people know how to make it actually happen.
You might say why is this? My answer, is again based on my experience 
in the healthcare industry. The fact is that the current system is so caught 
up in trying to survive the chaos of what is currently going on that they 
find themselves with no time think or enough energy and resources to 
bring about change. In my opinion the industry lacks the insight, the 
talent and the leadership to transform the healthcare industry forward. 
Our A.P.P.L.E. system of Modern Day House Calls® is a solution to a lot 
of problems that currently exist in the healthcare system:
•	 Inappropriate admissions to the hospital that could have been 
managed in the home environment.
•	 Inappropriate discharges from the ER that perhaps should have 
been admitted to the hospital.
•	 Appropriate discharges from the ER, yet a patient that is still too 
sick to go home or survive the long wait in some doctor’s office 
for hours on end. 

TRANSFORM
386
•	 The ever growing concern of the “prematurely discharged 
patients” who all too frequently end up back in the ER and  
in the hospital in less than 30 days.
The future of medicine, the transformation of medicine, is going to 
be community based, workplace based and home based as in the form 
of Modern Day House Calls®. This is the transformation that we have 
already done in A.P.P.L.E. Our services have been well received by 
patients and families alike including all stakeholders who benefit from 
this transformed level of care. 
As one sees all the logical benefits that Modern Day House Calls® has 
to offer, one can logically assume this level of care will simply become 
expected by patients and stakeholders alike. The reason why this is 
true is because A.P.P.L.E. has proven that Modern Day House Calls® is 
the answer to what patients want and need, personalized high-quality 
cost-effective healthcare.
Modern Day House Calls® is the answer to inappropriate hospital 
admissions, early discharges, and early returns back to the hospital. 
Add to this a big problem in America known as the “overmedicated 
patient” as expressed in my previous best-selling book with Brian Tracy 
titled Against the Grain. You will see the problem of the overmedicated 
patient is all too often “the side effect of office-based medicine.” My 
chapter explains why A.P.P.L.E.’s Modern Day House Calls® is the 
solution to the overmedicated patient because medication reduction is 
best dealt with in a home based environment. A.P.P.L.E. is networked 
with homehealth services and is connected through continuity in care 
with specialists and primary care office-based physicians.
Modern Day House Calls® is a solution to an ever-increasing problem 
of patients simply not being able to come to a doctor’s office because 
of the fact that they are sick and in essence homebound. Modern 
Day House Calls is a tremendous benefit to family members who are 
frequently overburdened with difficulty getting their loved ones to the 
doctor.

387
THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE: MODERN DAY HOUSE CALLS® 
HOW DO YOU MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM  
OFFICE-BASED MEDICINE TO HOME-BASED MEDICINE? 
We at A.P.P.L.E. have already done this transformation in anticipation of 
the need for a model of how healthcare should be delivered in America. 
The details of how to actually go about the transformation is beyond the 
scope of this chapter. 
In summary, I have presented the opportunity for patients and physicians 
and stakeholders alike to….realize that house calls and homehealth 
medicine is a real high-quality cost-effective solution to many of the 
problems that plague the current healthcare system in America. In 
building a legacy, a benchmark model of healthcare delivery, we have 
done it alone in a limited way, but we cannot do it alone in a big way. 
We are interested in consulting and developing partnerships with parties 
who believe in our mission and wish to replicate what we have done 
and perhaps going beyond to what further could still be done. There will 
always be room for continued improvement.
It does not require anyone, patients or providers alike, to do anything 
different than they are currently doing. A.P.P.L.E. has simply created a 
system of healthcare delivery within the current system of healthcare in 
America. 
In order to really make a difference in healthcare throughout America, 
my chapter in this book is a call to action, an invitation, to patients, 
physicians and other healthcare providers, including other stakeholders 
throughout the country, to join our network and our mission to support 
A.P.P.L.E. Medical Homehealth as the benchmark of how healthcare 
should be delivered in America today. 
Finally, and most importantly, I know patients and families are very  
satisfied with the healthcare that we provide in A.P.P.L.E. Many of our 
patients feel so fortunate that A.P.P.L.E. as Modern Day House Calls® 
actually exists. 
“I think, when it all comes down to it, what patients most want is quality 
time with their doctor.”

CHAPTER 43
COLLEGE SUCCESS  
FOR A LOT LESS!
— 3 STEPS TO EDUCATE  
ALL YOUR KIDS WITHOUT 
“SETTLING” OR BANKRUPTING 
YOUR RETIREMENT
BY KEVIN ANDERSON
The parent names are all different—Ed and Rae, Bill and Lisa, Sharon, 
William, and others—but the concerns of the families I meet all center 
around a few common themes:
•	 I have some college savings but I am not sure it’s enough.
•	 We are behind saving for retirement and college. But college is 
key, so we may never retire.
•	 How can we pay for college and not saddle the family or the kids 
with a ton of debt?
•	 I don’t think we can afford the private school Holly wants to 
attend, so she is looking at State School U.
•	 Because of our income we won’t get financial aid, but we want the 
best for our kids. We want them to get into the best schools, but 
also want to minimize the pain of paying for it.

TRANSFORM
392
Families are being severely challenged by college costs, which continue 
to increase by 6-7% annually. To combat this, I believe that every family 
should have the information, insight, and help to make better decisions 
about college. With this support, they can attain the “College Success 
for a Lot Less” they seek…getting their kids into a chosen school - even 
their dream school—at a price affordable for the family. Affordable so 
that they can comfortably send all their kids to school…with little to no 
lingering debt…without sacrificing retirement. 
In the pages to come, I will share 3 Steps families can take. These steps 
are part and parcel of our proven college financial planning approach….
an approach that is different than college planning advice dispensed by 
traditional financial advisors. What does the typical college planning 
solution look like?
THE ROAD HEAVILY TRAVELLED LEADS  
TO A DEAD END FOR MOST
It is a road down which I have ventured. Nearly a decade ago, my son 
entered Georgetown University. Being a financial industry professional, 
I knew the traditional college planning process first-hand. 
We identified income and assets to fund college, bought the Princeton 
Review, researched schools on-line, bought ACT prep materials, and 
much more. Then we made a decision on a school. But we were playing 
with only half a deck of cards.
That’s because the college planning world is very complex. Without 
lots of the right kind of research or connection to a college funding 
professional with a holistic view, many parents operate without full 
knowledge of the college funding process, or how financial aid works 
and how to maximize it. 
That’s where I was too – I thought I had a good handle on the process, 
but there were myths and lack of knowledge that sub-optimized our 
result….we ended up over-paying for my son’s college education. I 
discovered this after I did lots of research, and got connected to a leading 
college financial planning organization where I received extensive, 
specific training to better advise clients. 
With intensive training and my subsequent experience in helping 
families, I began to see the heavily travelled road as a dead-end for 

393
COLLEGE SUCCESS FOR A LOT LESS! 
many families. What is that heavily travelled road? It is this common 
advice:
•	 Retirement funding is your first priority. 
•	 Once retirement contributions are proper, contribute to your 
college savings fund of choice (primarily the 529 Plan, or a 
Coverdell Savings Account or UGMA/UTMA Account).
•	 Money can be borrowed for college but not for retirement, so 
leverage student loans to pay for college. 
What’s the problem with this advice? For many families, it essentially 
means the kids are on their own! For most families I meet—even high 
income families—their retirement accounts aren’t fully funded and they 
are w-a-a-y behind in their college savings. 
Yet, all these families are absolutely committed to get their kids to 
college. And they are frustrated to no end because they can’t see a way 
out. And what began as a frustration for me evolved into a passion to 
advocate for parents and their families. The “road most travelled” advice 
was not helping most families solve their college funding challenge… 
it was a dead-end where parents needed help getting on the right track.
Case Study: Case in point, the Goode’s are a hard-working family with 
income around $70K/year, and two kids they want to send to college. 
They were following conventional advice, contributing as much as they 
could into their 401(k) plan (though still only half of goal). 
They could only free up $60/month for college savings when we first 
met, as they were saddled with $15K in debt that they were paying off 
at $600/month We estimated their out-of-pocket college cost over the 
next 10 years would be $60K…their savings would be woefully short. 
They had little hope but decided to pay us a visit after attending one of 
our frequent free community workshops for parents. 
After working collaboratively with the Goode’s on a customized college 
funding plan, we landed on a plan they excitedly decided to implement. 
In a nutshell, we leveraged several strategies and showed the Goode’s 
how they could pay off their debt, and redirect the monthly debt payment 
to their college fund. 
In the end, we showed the Goode’s how they could generate $90K in 

TRANSFORM
394
savings over the next 10 years. This was enough to not only cover their 
$60K out-of-pocket college costs, but also a $10K car for the kids, and 
some extra for “life happening.” Importantly, this plan had no impact 
on their retirement funding, and may even enhance it since the freed-
up savings can be redirected to the retirement account once college is 
funded! 
The good news is that there is a better way…a way for many families 
to not to have to choose between funding “Retirement or College” but 
instead, to be able to fund “Retirement and College.” A way for families 
to not face the terrible situation of having funded college for the first 
child, but not being able to fund the other children because they have 
already maxed out the loans the family can afford. 
THE BRAVE NEW ROAD TO TRAVEL:  
3 STEPS TO COLLEGE SUCCESS
As I coach families along the road to success, there are three stops we 
make along the way: 1) student readiness, 2) college selection/financial 
aid maximization, and 3) the college funding plan. Here’s the roadmap:
Step 1: Student Readiness—You Can’t Afford Slackers (Literally)
Student preparation is crucial for getting your child into a school of their 
choice and minimizing out-of-pocket costs. It encompasses engaging in 
activities to: 
1) maximize the GPA.
2) maximize ACT/SAT test scores (test prep courses).
3) execute an impactful application, essay and interview, if 
required.
4) get as much clarity on the major and career of the  
student as possible. 
Below is a list, though not comprehensive, of some key actions you can 
take. Warning: Your kid being a slacker in any area can cost big bucks!
•	 One of the highest-leverage opportunities is focusing on ACT/
SAT test prep activities to increase scores to targeted levels where 
the financial aid award will increase. Spending several hundred 
dollars or more on test prep that your kid actually engages can 

395
COLLEGE SUCCESS FOR A LOT LESS! 
potentially result in thousands of additional financial aid. 
•	 Private schools will often cost families less than the local state 
school…that’s right. Because of large endowments and more 
funding sources (alumni and private donations), many private 
schools can provide more financial aid/scholarships. Make 
sure you identify some private schools for your kids and at a 
minimum, explore them as stretch schools (a school that is a 
stretch for admittance based on your child’s GPA and ACT/SAT 
scores).
•	 The biggest cost lever in this area is helping your child get a high 
level of clarity on their major and career. Primarily due to this 
lack of clarity, the average school length is 5.8 years. Based on 
the 2013/14 average cost at a state college of $22,846, families 
would have to account for an additional $41,123 in college costs. 
But the real kick in the gut is the opportunity cost of the kids being 
nearly two years late getting into the workforce…at a 2013 average 
starting salary of $45,000 (National Association of Colleges and 
Employers), that’s $81,000 in lost income. Ouch! Kids often will 
discount parent counsel (translated nagging to them), so if necessary, 
involve someone who can coach, counsel, and cajole them to a place 
of clarity.
Step 2: College Selection/Financial Aid Maximization 
—Look Before You Leap
When selecting a college, families look at fit and cost. But the 
wrong cost is targeted, the sticker price, specifically the total Cost of 
Attendance (tuition, room and board, books, fees, travel, etc.). Case 
in point, I recently worked with a family where they were looking at a 
local college because its sticker price was $40,000 less than their dream 
school, Vanderbilt. In actuality, the student had the academic chops to 
get into school anywhere, and we found the family’s net cost would be 
$6,000 less at Vanderbilt than the state school! 
Instead of looking at sticker price, families need to get to the net cost. At 
the risk of over-simplification, apply this formula to each school being 
considered so your family has a true sense of out-of-pocket costs per 
year:

TRANSFORM
396
Cost of Attendance – Need-Based Aid – Merit-Based Aid  
– Private Scholarships – Your College Savings
 = The Family Projected Annual Out-of-Pocket Costs
a. Need-Based Aid (NBA) is the Cost of Attendance minus the 
Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC indicates what Uncle 
Sam expects your family to pay for college…could be $5,000/year or 
it could be $50,000 or more a year. It’s calculated by U.S. Dept. of 
Education and looks at over 100 financial factors like the income and 
assets of parents and students, parent ages, and number of kids. Every 
family is eligible but not all will qualify.
However, what you must know is that not every school will give you 
100% of the aid calculated by the formula. Some only typically give 
30% or 50% of that aid. Also, of the NBA they will give, not all is 
in free cash…some will be in loans and some will be in the form of 
college work study. You’ve got to sort this out upfront.
Another opportunity is to lower your EFC. Similar to income tax 
reduction, there are strategies to legally and ethically lower your EFC 
based on understanding the Financial Aid laws and regulations. This 
can be big…a $10,000/year EFC reduction means a family saves 
$40,000 over the four years of college. Just make sure you check 
with college-funding professionals who understand this area, to see 
if you have opportunities worth pursuing.
b. Merit-Based Aid (MBA) are grants/scholarships awarded based on 
high academic achievement (GPA, ACT/SAT). A key strategy is to 
target schools where the student will be in the top 25% of the class 
based on ACT/SAT scores and a qualifying GPA (target 3.5 or better). 
This upper quartile is where MBA is awarded.
c. Private Scholarships provide “free money” you apply for on your 
own. If you have a duck-calling skill, there is a scholarship for you! 
Most families should limit time searching for these, as they make 
up only about 2% to 3% of total financial aid awarded. Instead, 
go to fastweb.com, set-up a student profile, then just apply for the 
scholarships of interest that are matched to your profile.
Once you have researched financial aid/scholarships (whew), you’ll 
have the data to figure out your bottom line at each school. You can 
do much of this work yourself with a lot of time and diligence. Like 

397
COLLEGE SUCCESS FOR A LOT LESS! 
many, you may instead prefer to use a special niche firm like ours, a 
college funding advisor with access to proprietary software that can do 
this analysis for you. 
Step 3: The College Funding Plan—Cash is King
For college funding success, there is no way around it….cash is king. 
For most families, using significant amounts of debt to fund college 
ends up being a long nightmare. 
Most parents will need to pay some out-of-pocket costs. Only .3% of all 
college students (less than 20,000) will get a “free ride” and even those 
parents find there will be some level of costs—travel, miscellaneous—
not covered. So, here’s the blueprint for your college funding plan:
•	 Assume the school each of your kids will attend and use the 
formula from Step 2 to calculate a total projected cost to send all 
of your kids to college.
•	 From your total projected cost to send all your kids to college, 
subtract out your future projected savings to calculate your 
college funding gap.
•	 Now figure out where you can free-up money or increase income 
to fund as much of the gap as possible. Like in the example of 
the Goode’s, there is often not an obvious solution. That’s when 
you need to seek coaching from an advisor with experience 
in financial aid, cash flow, tax planning, and general financial 
planning strategies.
•	 Once the funding source(s) have been identified, savings vehicles 
(529 Plans, etc.) need to be evaluated to house the funds. Some 
of the key factors to consider: Will your contributions be limited? 
Will the savings in the vehicle count against your financial aid? 
How much, if any, of the funds should be in the market vs. a 
principal-protected account? Do you want tax-deferral and tax-
free use of the funds?
My philosophy is to create a “Firm Plan” vs. a “Probable (market-based) 
Plan” for college planning. Money in the plan needs to grow to protect 
against inflation but it’s more critical for all the money to be there when 
needed for college. In the end, build a plan that you can stick with over 
the 6 to 15 years most families—that I see—will fund college. 

TRANSFORM
398
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THIS?
You just experienced nearly the entire college funding process crammed 
into a short chapter, insights very similar to what I share in monthly 
workshops with parents in St. Louis, Louisville, and beyond. Parents 
exposed to this body of knowledge do one of three things….one group 
proceeds and implements all the steps themselves. Another group seeks 
out the help of a professional to implement some or all of the steps. A 
final group ends up doing nothing. Oh, they think about it a lot, saying 
they will do something soon….but soon turns into a week, then a month, 
then “we’ll figure it out somehow.” 
But I hope you are in Group 1 or 2….that you will resolve to solve your 
college funding challenge today while you can make the most of it, 
not in a few months or years right before college starts. And what’s the 
payoff? Getting all of your kids to a school of choice, with little to no 
debt for you or them, at rock-bottom costs for college, with retirement 
unscathed. Stress-free college for the kids (at least from debt!)... and 
peace-of-mind for you, the parents! May College Success for a Lot Less 
be yours, I am pulling for you!

— HOW A RENOWNED 
STRENGTH AND  
CONDITIONING PROGRAM 
CAN IMPACT EVERY  
AREA OF YOUR LIFE
BY JOSH FELBER
People who know me as this serial entrepreneur always wonder where 
the seeds for my career were planted. My dad is a computer technician, 
which may explain why I started my first business as a computer dealer 
at 14. But it all really started when I read two books that influenced 
me just like millions of others: Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich 
and Tony Robbins’ Unlimited Power. It’s definitely been an interesting 
journey towards success in various industries, starting with my founding 
of Merchant Financial Services and later including ventures into 
satellite dish installation, “nutraceuticals” (Lifemax) and green energy 
solutions. 	
I’m grateful for all the lessons I have learned about myself and building 
a business through these various ventures, but all of those experiences 
were a prelude to my current role as Founder and President of the Akron, 

TRANSFORM
402
Ohio-based Functional Fitness Labs, LLC, originally called CrossFit 
Akron. Since we opened in October 2010, each year the operation has 
experienced a substantial increase in gross revenue, which led me to 
move into a 7,000 square foot facility and also open a second location. 
I’ve always found that success has a way of multiplying itself, and our 
facility has attracted the interest of potential partners to open additional 
locations, starting with a third site later in 2014, and starting to franchise 
in 2015. 
TURNING MY PASSION INTO A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
The reason I’m probably more excited about this business, its impact on 
thousands of people in my region and its unlimited growth potential is 
simple: it grew organically out of personal passion for CrossFit, which 
I discovered in 2003. For the uninitiated, CrossFit is a fitness company 
and exercise philosophy created by Greg Glassman in 1974 and became 
popular in 2000. It’s a strength and conditioning program with the aim 
of improving, among other things, muscular strength, cardio-respiratory 
endurance and flexibility via routines that incorporate high intensity 
interval training, Olympic weightlifting, plyometric, powerlifting, 
gymnastics, calisthenics, strongman exercises and other functional 
movements. 
I’ve always been athletic and enjoyed running marathons. When I was 
in my mid 20’s, I got back into it. Aaron, a close friend and exercise 
science major at that time, was interested in enlisting in the Navy SEALs 
and he inspired me to sign up with him. However, the only program we 
could enlist in was a delayed entry program in which we would ship out 
a year from the time we signed up. We were guaranteed a spot to go to 
BUDS SEAL Training in California – but we had to wait. Focusing on 
ways to get in better shape for when the time came, we discovered the 
CrossFit website. It struck us as different in that it combined functional 
movements of the things we normally do in life – squatting, pressing, 
lifting things – with barbells, kettlebells and Olympic lifting. We started 
pulling workouts from the site as well as designing our own based on 
the methodology. 
Later I blew out my knee water skiing, so I couldn’t follow through with 
the SEALs, but I used CrossFit for my rehabilitation. The feeling I got 
from CrossFit reminded me of the “runner’s high” I would get running 

403
FITNESS TRAINING GOES HOLISTIC
15-20 miles on training runs, only I would also be discovering muscles 
I never knew I had. The challenging regimen fit perfectly into my desire 
to always try to do things out of my comfort zone. Because so many 
people were posting about their progress on the site, my competitive 
juices were stirred, which made me accomplish more. I was able to 
cut my running back because CrossFit gave me a complete full-body 
workout. 
Long story short, around the end of 2009, I was building a company 
focused on Green Wireless energy products, but I was tired of sitting 
behind a desk. I wanted to get into some sort of environment where I 
could engage and help people directly – and CrossFit seemed to be an 
awesome way to do that. As I had in the past with other businesses, I did 
extensive research and began consulting with others who had launched 
CrossFit facilities across the country. In June 2010, I got my CrossFit 
certification and by October, we were open. You never know how things 
will turn out, but I was disheartened when I learned that most people who 
open these facilities have zero CrossFit or entrepreneurial experience. I 
was fortunate to have both. 
The new venture quickly became the fastest growing of five in the NE 
Ohio region, and within the first year we had 120 clients, while the others 
had from 40-80 after being in business for three years. We delivered the 
most powerful training and excellence in coaching…and our attention 
to customer service and strong social media and marketing efforts paid 
off. While our average demographic is people in their 30s who were 
onetime athletes who wanted to get back into shape, we help everyone 
from kids to seniors, and about 60 percent of our clients are women. 
I think one of the keys to achieving success in business and life in general 
is finding that passion that keeps you up late and fills you with energy 
on an everyday basis – something that keeps you moving forward and 
drives you to break through the challenges that come up. Once you 
identify that, then it’s a matter of seeking the right opportunity. 
OVERCOMING THE BARRIERS OF LIMITED BELIEFS
Not surprisingly considering the impact our beliefs about ourselves have 
on every aspect of our lives, I have found that the barriers that keep people 
from achieving their fitness goals are the same ones that hold us back in 
other key aspects of our lives. Two of the greatest benefits of CrossFit 

TRANSFORM
404
training are its ability to help people overcome the limited beliefs that 
create roadblocks to success and the importance of accountability. If 
someone is going to work out by him or herself, or work one-on-one 
with a trainer, that person will likely reach a certain plateau and not go 
further. CrossFit allows people to be coached in groups of 4-10 people 
who are peers in whatever age and experience level they are at. 
They’re not only being pushed by a coach to challenge themselves 
to achieve breakthroughs, but they are subconsciously motivated by 
the progress that athletes around them are making. Human beings are 
competitive and seeing others just like us succeed helps inspire us to 
‘up’ our game. Just as I became more successful in my CrossFit training 
because of the athletes’ postings on the website years ago, our clients 
will think things like, “She’s doing all this and she’s a lot older than I 
am. So I can do it too.” 
Often our beliefs are limited because the scope of our goals contradicts 
the conservative mindset we were raised with as far as the risks we 
could take and what we could achieve. Maybe you grew up thinking 
‘money was the root of all evil,’ but that now goes against your goals 
of pursuing a business opportunity that could help you put your kids 
through college. So you must find a way to reconcile these things. Align 
your beliefs with your goals, and then once you have those in alignment, 
start creating through massive action. 
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT COACHING
At Functional Fitness Labs, we’re here to help people achieve their 
fitness and weight-loss goals – but that’s just the start. Our goal is to 
help clients succeed in all other areas of their lives too - the whole 
body, mind and spirit thing. So for those who want it, we offer personal 
development coaching. It’s wonderful to watch people transform 
physically over the course of weeks or months, but even more exciting 
is hearing the way our holistic regimen has impacted their families, 
relationships and careers. How we train and coach here helps empower 
people who may have been timid in their lives outside the facility. 
They may have been timid about asking their bosses for a promotion or 
finding the energy and mental acuity to get a difficult task done. Some 
clients are entrepreneurial like I am, but have just never had the courage 
to break the chains of 9 to 5 and take what I call a “calculated risk.” The 

405
FITNESS TRAINING GOES HOLISTIC
confidence we instill in one area can take root in others. 
When clients start their CrossFit training, we give them an interesting 
apparatus to lift. It’s a white plastic PVC pipe, about seven feet long, 
which we use to help them learn different lifting movement patterns. It’s 
lighter than a barbell but simulates one. The goal is to help them develop 
“muscle memory” and get the movement patterns ingrained in them. We 
had one client, Kristen, in her late 20s or early 30s, who was very timid 
and started group sessions with the pipe in the back of the room. Our 
coach Jason noticed her hesitation and started pushing her, engaging her 
to produce better results. We’re always trying to gauge such things. She 
wasn’t overweight, she had just come here to feel better and get rid of 
stress in her life. 
Over time, with Jason’s personal challenges to her and those challenges 
that came from being in an environment with her peers, we started 
seeing not only progressing strength, but also more personal confidence. 
She slowly came out of her shell – and now is that take charge person 
standing in front of the group during workouts and participating in 
some of our extracurricular events. While all this was going on, we 
were helping her with personal development. She told us of her outside 
life goals, and one was to progress in her career in the marketing and 
advertising field. 
Our goal was to help her correlate the self-confidence and beliefs she 
had gained about herself in the gym with what she does in her job. 
She had come in with those limited belief shackles, thinking she wasn’t 
good enough in a lot of areas of her life. But the fact that she had come 
here told us she wanted to change that – she just needed encouragement. 
In our personal development sessions, we taught her how to utilize all 
of the breakthroughs she was achieving – the pushing through fear and 
pain, her ultimate resolve to go after her goals – and bring it full force 
into the corporate environment. 
Something finally clicked, and maybe a week after one of our sessions, 
she came in very excited. She told us that she had talked to her bosses 
and they had promoted her to the position she wanted. She wanted to 
give us credit, but we said we were just there to help her understand that 
what she did at the gym applied to her whole life. Many fitness facilities 
are impersonal places where people just come in, do their thing and 

TRANSFORM
406
leave. But we want our clients to come here and use what they do with 
us to change their whole lives. Of course, one of the drawbacks for us is 
that clients who have gotten these kinds of promotions often take them 
in other cities – so they leave Akron. But what’s personally sad for us is 
ultimately great for them, and for that reason, we couldn’t be happier. 
Whether you’re working out in a gym or a top athlete on a sports team, 
it’s amazing what can be achieved through proper coaching. The same 
applies to success in business or any other endeavor. Having a coach 
who understands your goals and can help you achieve them can be a 
crucial element to your success. 
THE MARATHON RUNNER
Which brings us to Raun, who joined us not long after we opened our 
doors. He weighed 350 lbs. and was very concerned because heart 
disease ran in his family and he was at high risk. During our free intro 
and consultation, he stated his goals simply: he wanted to lose weight and 
feel healthy again. We promised him that if he stuck with our program 
diligently, nine or ten months later, he would be running the Akron Half 
Marathon. He scoffed, saying he could barely walk around his house. 
But we inspired him, and he in turn inspired us with his dedication. Sure 
enough, he dropped 80 pounds in that time and was strong, toned up and 
had the stamina enough to run it. Now he’s down to 222 pounds. Despite 
his weight gain, he had what most would consider a successful life. He 
was married and was an entrepreneur. But we were able to give him that 
extra confidence that came with all he was achieving here. 
As much as we love to see bodies become stronger and healthier, these 
lifestyle transformation and success stories are the driving force behind 
what we do here. 
Raun dedicated himself to a powerful transformation based on 
unwavering focus, discipline and determination – all qualities that can 
be applied to being successful in any area of a person’s life. 
BODY AND MIND CONNECTIONS
One thing is clear to me from working these past few years in the 
fitness realm. Regimens like CrossFit give people that extra edge to 
push themselves in business, while increasing the stamina and energy 
necessary to become more efficient in the business world and increase 

407
FITNESS TRAINING GOES HOLISTIC
one’s focus on success. When you work out, your brain releases 
hormones and chemicals that affect the body’s wellness and well-being. 
Sometimes, this can create a true healing power, as in the gentleman 
named Bob who came to us when he had cancer. He had tried out an 
experimental hormone blocker, but he says that combined with the 
CrossFit training, the course of his cancer has reversed. And just as 
fitness can lead the body to heal itself, it can also heal a broken mindset 
in a different way. We have been able to train several thousand people 
over the past few years, and most of our best stories, like the ones I 
have written about in this chapter, come from breaking through those so 
called “belief barriers” and conquering one’s fear of the unknown. 
We don’t work miracles here. CrossFit takes great commitment and 
hard work. But if the people who come for us seeking transformation 
in their physical lives can take away even a single nugget of wisdom - 
or just a little bit of the practical information they have learned - and 
then utilize that to dramatically change their personal, professional and 
psychological life, we feel like we have served our purpose.

THE SECRET TO TRUE HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND FIVE SIMPLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE IT
CHAPTER 45
THE SECRET TO TRUE 
HEALTH AND WELLNESS  
AND FIVE SIMPLE STEPS  
TO ACHIEVE IT
BY DR. JOSE AGUILAR
The doctor of the future will give no medicine,  
but will interest his patients in the cause of the human frame,  
in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease.  
~ Thomas Edison.
This quote shows just how far ahead of his time this forward thinker was. 
He understood that in order for our future doctors to understand health 
they would need to understand the importance of the human frame, our 
diet and most importantly, the cause and prevention of disease. So let’s 
start off by defining what health is, first of all. I pose this question to all 
of my patients and some of the most common answers I hear include: 
feeling good, not feeling any pain, not feeling sick, or I don’t have any 
symptoms. Based on these answers it shows me how most people treat 
their own health. In other words they wait for something to happen 
before they take any kind of action. But let me ask this, can a person not 
be healthy even though they feel good, or don’t feel any pain or aren’t 
feeling sick? Of course they can! In fact the top 2 killer diseases in the 

TRANSFORM
412
U.S., Heart Disease and Cancer, are known as SILENT KILLERS! In 
the U.S, 1 in 2 people will die of some type of heart-related condition 
and 1 in 3 will die of some type of cancer-related disease. Many times 
a person is completely unaware of their prognosis until it’s too late. As 
you can see now, health shouldn’t be based on how a person feels. 
So what is true health? In order to determine what true health is, let’s 
start at the very beginning. The power of conception turns just two cells 
into a human being consisting trillions of cells nine months later. These 
two original cells go through numerous processes to multiply/divide 
into other cells. About eight weeks after conception we begin to form 
our very first organ. Do you know what it is? Is it our heart? Our lungs? 
No, it is our brain and from there we also start forming our spinal cord. 
Then we begin to see the nerves branch out and at the end of these nerves 
comes every cell, tissue and organ in the body. Why aren’t the heart or 
lungs or any other organ the first? Simply put, because the brain controls 
everything; without the brain and spinal cord, the heart doesn’t know 
how or when to beat, the lungs don’t know how to breathe. Nothing 
can function without the brain communicating and controlling all of the 
information. No wonder our Central Nervous System has been referred 
to as the Master Control System for our bodies. 
Your brain controls every single function of the body. How? Different 
people call this different things; some call it Mother Nature, some call 
it Chi and some call it Spirit or Soul. The Medical and Chiropractic 
professions call it Innate Intelligence. Innate simply means something 
we are born with, and intelligence is just that, intelligence. Innate 
intelligence is something within all of us throughout our entire lives. 
This is the power that allows us to breathe, digest, heal cuts, etc. You 
don’t have to think about it. It is the power that controls everything. 
So we can say that 100% expression of this Innate Intelligence allows 
every organ, muscle, and tissue to function as it should be functioning, 
all of the time. When everything functions at 100%, that is when we are 
expressing 100% True Health and Wellness. 
It is when we are no longer expressing 100% function that we are no 
longer Healthy and Well. What causes this decrease from 100%? Stress! 
What is stress? Stress is difficult to define because it is a highly-subjective 
phenomenon that differs for each of us. Things that are distressful for 
some might be pleasurable for others. For example, for those of you who 

413
THE SECRET TO TRUE HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND FIVE SIMPLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE IT
are neat freaks, you’d probably agree that having ten people staying in 
your house for a long weekend could be incredibly stressful; however, 
if you are someone who doesn’t mind chaos and clutter, then let the 
fun begin! Similarly, if you thrive on to-do lists and deadlines, a week 
with absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to go could make you crazy, 
whereas another person might feel rejuvenated and refreshed. 
We each respond differently to stress, as it can have a wide range of 
effects on people’s emotions, mood and behavior. The easiest way to 
understand stress is to view it as the source of any change in YOUR 
world that evokes some reaction from you. The most important thing 
to remember about stress is that it’s a normal part of life. The problem 
is not with stress itself. Rather, the problem lies with how much stress, 
how often we feel stressed and what tools we have to deal with stress.
The fight-or-flight response is what enabled our ancestors to deal with 
a more hostile, physically-demanding world of hunting, fighting, and 
surviving. It’s the body’s innate response to a perceived threat. The stress 
response is optimally designed to protect us from direct, identifiable and 
short-term danger, such as running from a tiger in the wilderness. In 
modern life, however, most of the time the source of our stress is not as 
direct but rather indirect, as in the daily hassles of a commute; and not 
short-term but instead continuing for days, weeks or even months. When 
stress hormones are continually released and your body is continually 
in fight-or-flight mode, and yet you have no physical release for these 
surges of energy and hormones, then damage can occur. 
Although the emergency measure of this stress response is undoubtedly 
both vital and valuable, it can also be disruptive and damaging. Most 
humans rarely encounter emergencies that require physical effort, 
yet our biology still provides for them. Thus, we may find our stress 
response activated in situations where physical action is unnecessary. 
This activation takes a toll on both our bodies and our minds. Diarrhea, 
constipation, and difficulty maintaining sexual arousal are typical 
examples. And when this response continues unchecked during times 
of chronic stress, the harmful effects inhibit digestion, reproduction, 
growth, tissue repair, and the responses of your immune and 
inflammatory systems. In other words, some very important functions 
that keep your body healthy begin to shut down. When this occurs for 
a prolonged period of time, our body breaks down at its weakest link in 

TRANSFORM
414
the form of symptoms such as a headache or a stress-related disorder. In 
this manner, stress can literally become a killer. We all know that stress 
can have wide ranging effects on emotions, mood and behavior. Equally 
important but often less discussed are effects on various systems, organs 
and tissues all over the body. 
There are numerous emotional and physical disorders that have 
been linked to stress including depression, anxiety, heart attacks, 
stroke, hypertension and immune system disturbances that increase 
susceptibility to infections. We know that almost every system in your 
body can be damaged by stress. In fact, it’s hard to think of any disease 
in which stress cannot play an aggravating role or any part of the body 
that is not adversely affected by stress. 
Now understand that what I am saying is not that we need to eliminate 
stress from our lives, because quite frankly that would be extremely 
difficult since we are surrounded by some form of stress from the 
moment we are born until the moment we die. What I am saying is that 
we need to train our bodies to cope with stress in a better fashion. There 
are five steps that everyone needs to take to be better able to handle the 
stress we come face-to-face with on a regular basis – so that our bodies 
are more capable of staying in that 100% functional model we discussed 
earlier.
Positive Mental Attitude: Let’s begin with number 1, a positive mental 
attitude. Staying positive can be difficult at times and that’s ok, but the 
more we can stay on the happier side of things, the better off our body 
and our health will be. How many times have you seen someone who is 
really sick and happy about it? Not very often. Do things in your life that 
you like to do and which make you happy – such as spending time with 
your family and friends, reading a good book, watching your favorite 
TV show, etc. Promote positive things in your life. Thoughts of fear, 
anger and worry all lead to negative emotional states, which actually 
cause our bodies to secrete substances that promote aging and ill health. 
Positive thoughts cause our bodies to secrete chemicals that slow down 
the aging process and can actually bring about healing in our bodies.
Sleep: Second is sleep. A majority of American adults (63%) do not 
get the recommended eight hours of sleep needed for good health and 
optimum performance. An average of less than five hours of sleep a day 

415
THE SECRET TO TRUE HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND FIVE SIMPLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE IT
nearly doubles your chance of suffering a heart attack, or dying from 
one, compared to those who get more regular sleep. 
Sleep deprivation impairs mental performance almost as much as being 
intoxicated. A study found that one night’s sleep loss is the equivalent 
to working or driving with a blood-alcohol level of .05 percent (to put it 
in perspective, the legal blood alcohol level in the US is .08 percent). If 
your body isn’t getting the chance to rest and repair, then you are simply 
forcing your body to feel stressed and depriving your body of operating 
at its fullest capacity. 
Nutrition: Third includes proper nutrition. Feeling stressed can cause 
acidic conditions in your body, and conversely, an acidic body will make 
you feel stressed and irritable. A major contributor to raising your acid 
levels is the food you eat. An excess of acid in your body fluids creates 
joint pain, weak bones, promotes weight gain, as well as makes you feel 
sluggish, tired or irritable. As you get older, your body becomes less 
efficient in getting rid of acid. For optimal health, it is suggested that 
approximately 70% of your food should be alkaline-forming foods and 
approximately 30% of your food should be acid-forming foods. 
Problems occur when you consume more acid-forming foods than 
alkaline-forming foods. A study comparing the behavior of boys in a 
juvenile detention center with the type of food they ate found that when 
they ate more refined and processed foods, the violence rates increased. 
When the food was changed to fresh and less-processed food, the 
violence rates dropped dramatically. 
The base of a healthy diet should be fresh fruits and vegetables. They 
hold many vitamins and minerals needed for optimal health, but they 
also hold a plentiful supply of phytochemicals. All three of these 
elements protect your body from illness and supply your body with 
an endless amount of energy. The main concept of a high nutrient diet 
is whole, unprocessed foods with lots of fruits and vegetables, whole 
grains, healthy fats and lean sources of proteins. 
Exercise: Exercise is step 4. You don’t have to “workout” or “lift 
weights” to get exercise. Everyone needs exercise, from babies to the 
elderly. Exercise includes physical activities such as walking, running, 
jumping, playing, etc. It also includes Mental Activities such as reading, 
writing, drawing, and other activities that stimulate your brain. Exercise 

TRANSFORM
416
improves your brain activity, improves your body’s ability to heal, and 
generally makes us feel good. There’s an old saying that goes, “If you 
don’t use it you lose it.” So make sure you get at least 30 minutes of 
exercise on a daily basis.
Fully Functioning Nervous System: The fifth step to 100% Optimal 
Health is a fully-functioning nervous system. This just so happens to be 
my area of expertise. As a chiropractor I have seen many different cases 
where people have come in to my office with some kind of condition – 
whether it be pain, illness or some other debilitating problem – looking 
for a sense of hope. They’ve tried pretty much everything else and can’t 
seem to get better. In fact, it was seeing this same kind of reaction I saw 
growing up. You see, my mother suffered from migraines when I was 
a child. Sometimes these migraines were so bad that she would have 
to lock herself up in her bedroom with lights down and no other noise 
throughout the house. But as a child of only 10 years old at the time 
and with 2 other siblings, there was no way we were able to stay put for 
longer than 5 minutes. The ruckus we would cause led to our mother 
storming out her room, yelling at us, almost on the verge of tears at 
times, saying that we were causing things to get much worse for her. 
Hearing this come from my mother made me feel very afraid, so much 
that I started to change how I was interacting with other people. I was 
becoming more introverted and keeping to myself more and more. 
Luckily for us, our neighbor saw these changes in me and asked what 
was going on. I explained to him about my mother’s migraines and how 
I didn’t want to hurt her anymore. Hearing this, he asked to sit with my 
family and talk to us. I didn’t know it, but that is when my life changed. 
What I heard coming from his mouth was what I just shared with you 
above. And my 10-year-old brain just gobbled it up! It all made perfect 
sense. The brain controls everything. Check. Stress is how we react to 
something and our body has to react as well. Check. And the kicker, true 
health and wellness comes from our bodies being able to function 100% 
from the inside out, not by treating the symptoms on the outside. 
My mind was blown away, and it was then that I decided that I was 
going to be a chiropractor and help my mom. When my mother began 
chiropractic care we saw a change occur within the first week. Her 
migraines went from lasting 2-3 days down to 20 minutes. Over time 
they were completely resolved. So not only was her health restored, 

417
THE SECRET TO TRUE HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND FIVE SIMPLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE IT
but I also received a great gift as well. It’s what I call the gift of having 
a normal childhood. I was now able to have fun and get rambunctious 
without thinking in the back of my mind, “Am I hurting my mom again?” 
It is because of this that I devoted my life to chiropractic and the great 
healing capabilities the body is able to accomplish when expressing 
its fullest potential. The ability to transform one’s health comes from 
within, and it is always a miracle to me when I get to see it happening 
on a daily basis in my office.

FIVE INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH POTENTIAL OF YOUR BUSINESS
CHAPTER 46
FIVE INNOVATIVE STEPS  
TO ACCELERATE THE 
GROWTH POTENTIAL OF 
YOUR BUSINESS
BY JOSEPH INFANTE
Dreaming carries no risks. The dangerous thing is  
trying to transform your dreams into reality. 
 ~ Paolo Coelho
Creative genius. That’s what you really are. Beneath all of your 
negativity, fears and concerns lies a very powerful being waiting to be 
unleashed. And the journey of becoming an effective creator of value 
in the marketplace is an important process of transformation that all 
entrepreneurs endure. It involves changing the way you think about 
yourself, your business, your role in it, your market, and ultimately your 
results. The fact is most of us run away from the challenge of having to 
think, and, indeed, learning how to think better. This requires dissolving 
some of our social and personal conditioning by going deep into the 
subconscious; but it also involves a grounding assessment of why you 
want to transform in a certain direction in the first place. 
Why does all of this self-examination even matter? Because the 
realization of any goal and its speed of execution (whether it be building 

TRANSFORM
420
a business, becoming a better parent, finding your soulmate, or even 
losing weight), is dictated by achievable goals, rather than delusional 
fantasies. 
Before diving into some of the details (at least in summary form), let 
me share a quick story about myself in order to highlight how our 
subconscious can stifle progress.
My divorce represented a major turning point in my life. It marked a 
period of incredible lows, but also became my greatest blessing. For the 
first time, I had to re-examine everything up to that point that I had been 
taught or I had come to know: my children, my career, my finances, 
my childhood, my family, my skills, and every personal relationship 
past, present, and future. For more than three years, I went on a journey 
of self-discovery, trying to learn where and why my movie had taken 
such a sharp curve in the wrong direction on so many levels, and how 
difficult moving forward was proving to be. All I did know is that I had 
three children who needed a father, and I wanted to be able to have the 
most flexible schedule possible to adequately assume that role. Working 
again on Wall Street seemed less viable, and I had no desire to find a 
traditional 9-to-5 corporate job. Time was running out. 
I quickly turned my attention to the Internet and worked day and 
night trying to figure it all out. Living hand-to-mouth, there was only 
a deep desire and boiling ambition sustaining me. And it had become 
increasingly obvious to me that it wasn’t because of a lack of effort that I 
was not achieving my desired results, I simply had too much unresolved 
emotional baggage at the subconscious level to truly move forward. 
All of this subconscious clutter was keeping me from manifesting a 
new life. Fortunately, I met Suzanne Biddiscombe of the Source for 
Change in Florida. Through her innovative Authentic Release Healing 
method, she cleared and released all of those mental imprints, going as 
far back as my early childhood, that were keeping me from tapping my 
full potential. This emotional cleansing of sorts dramatically improved 
every area of my life: my Internet marketing and lead generation 
business grew exponentially (including being recognized and featured 
as a leading Internet marketer in the book - Internet Masters: Top 
Techniques, Tactics, and Tips From Online Marketing Experts); my 
personal relationships were healed; and I learned to fully embrace my 

421
FIVE INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH POTENTIAL OF YOUR BUSINESS
power. I would encourage you to learn more about Suzanne Biddiscombe 
at: TheSourceForChange.com. 
I understand that you may find yourself in a similar place right now - 
not understanding why you are expending so much energy with such 
limited results. Indeed, the drag and friction of your clutter can certainly 
drain your power, and render you a weaker creator. So being able to 
identify and remove it (in all of its forms - emotional, physical, and 
relationship-related) is essential, particularly for those of you starting or 
trying to grow a business. 
At the same time, there is also a tendency to be a scattered thinker, 
and not mastering the necessary skills to effectively execute your 
transformation. It is important to recognize that the brain has different 
stages of learning, which reflects, in large part, the extent to which the 
subconscious has recorded the new behavior. Essentially, the highest 
form of learning is where the conscience is allowed to focus on other 
matters, while the subconscious is practically operating on auto-pilot. 
Just think about how you drive today vs. when you first drove a car. 
You don’t think anymore. You simply drive. Your objective is to reach 
this higher state of learning – unconscious competence – in relation to 
those new activities which you are uniquely qualified to perform for 
your chosen path. 
Set out below are the broad stages of learning, from lowest to highest:
1.	Unconscious incompetence: You don’t know what you don’t know
2.	Conscious incompetence: You know what you don’t know (e.g., a 
first-time driver)
3.	Conscious competence: You are aware of what is required, but need 
to be consciously engaged to perform a given task (e.g., parallel 
parking)
4.	Unconscious competence: You know and perform a task without 
effort (e.g., a seasoned driver) 
Here’s the problem: few people spend the appropriate time to evolve 
towards that higher stage of learning (unconscious competence), where 
they have, in essence, overlearned and subconsciously absorbed the 
critical things required to achieve massive results. Instead, they jump 
from one tactic to another, one shiny object to the next, one big idea 

TRANSFORM
422
to some other, while never mastering the skills and processes that can 
catapult their transformation. Ultimately, frustration, disappointment, 
and unrealized potential rule the day. 
So what are five key steps that you can take to avoid some of the common 
pitfalls that prevent you from realizing the objectives desired in your 
business specifically, and life in general? 
Step 1. Establish Achievable Goals. Not all goals are worthwhile 
pursuing. And, in certain cases, some goals are not congruent with 
who you are. While you may have very lofty goals, you probably have 
not considered what these goals imply in terms of time and resources 
required, the potential impact on other areas of your life, as well as their 
benefits and costs. In short, BIG goals imply BIG costs. Goal setting 
is not a list of dreams. Rather they need to be determined within the 
scope of what’s desirable and believable. For your goals to be desirable, 
the benefits must outweigh the price you are willing to pay in terms of 
time and resources. And for them to be really believable, your belief 
system has to be congruent with the beliefs required to manifest them. 
Transforming into your new self can become very challenging if your 
beliefs about yourself are things such as, “I’m not good enough,” “I 
don’t have the capacity,” “I am powerless,” or “only rich people get 
ahead,” just to a name a few. The point is that goals are irrelevant if the 
beliefs held by the goal setter are incongruent. 
Step 2. Limit The Number Of Goals. There is a common misperception 
that humans are good at multi-tasking. This is the farthest thing from 
the truth. Humans are extraordinarily good at focusing on one task at a 
time, and our effectiveness declines as more and more tasks are added to 
the mix. As such, setting too many goals, even if they are “achievable” 
on an individual basis, may dramatically dilute your results. You also 
need to provide the necessary focus and total commitment to each goal 
you set, powering through with raw tenacity and persistence. A useful 
resource to understand the dynamics of living a high performing life 
is the book written by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz, The Power of 
Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High 
Performance and Personal Renewal.
Step 3. Enact Daily Rituals To Reprogram Your Subconscious. Here’s 
the good news – your brain can be re-wired to create a new version of 

423
FIVE INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH POTENTIAL OF YOUR BUSINESS
yourself. Neuroplasticity is certainly a very large topic, sufficient to take 
up this whole chapter and the entirety of this book. Indeed, much of the 
inner workings of the brain remain an unresolved mystery. However, 
we do know this: you can start changing the circuitry of your brain, 
and your experiences, by deliberately changing your daily routines on 
a regular basis. These may include how you get to work, interacting 
with a different person every day, or getting ready in a different way 
each morning. If you are hoping for different results in your life, then 
you must start changing the way you engage with it. Having said this, 
there are other daily rituals that can allow you to accelerate the brain’s 
re-wiring process. 
Self-talk is one daily ritual that has been instrumental in helping me do 
just that. In the book, What To Say When You Talk To Yourself, Dr. Shad 
Helmstetter discusses in great detail how most self-talk is mired with 
negativity, and accounts for the lion-share of our actual conversations. 
By pro-actively managing this internal dialogue, you can reshape how 
you view yourself internally at a subconscious level, and thus produce 
very different results in your external world. With this in mind, I have 
programmed my phone, so that every morning at 8 am, it automatically 
launches a recorded audio of me describing in detail my ideal, average 
day in the present tense. Now I purposely have used the words: “ideal, 
average day.” This is NOT an exercise in fantasy talk, where you are 
drinking coffee at a café in Paris, while millions of dollars are pouring 
into your bank. This is about crafting a story that is both achievable 
based on your current set of circumstances and can be experienced on 
an average day. This can help you to deliberately frame your thoughts 
each day, and to quiet competing thoughts that may be distracting you 
from your ultimate objectives. 
Step 4. Use Obstacles as Objectives Rather Than Excuses. All of 
us have struggled with obstacles. And it is both reasonable and highly 
probable that you will face obstacles along the way. But rather than 
using obstacles as potential excuses for either falling short of your goals 
or not moving forward at all, plan for your obstacles ahead of time. By 
listing the obstacles that you are likely to encounter in advance, these 
same obstacles can be easily converted into intermediate objectives 
that need to be addressed as part of reaching the overall goal. In some 
cases, you may identify ways of avoiding certain obstacles altogether. 
In essence, the obstacles are turned upside down, and used for your 

TRANSFORM
424
benefit rather than a deterrent. At the same time, it’s important to address 
the constraints that may limit your ability to address some of these 
obstacles. To do so, you need to have a clear understanding of your 
own limitations or constraints, and how they may possibly inhibit your 
progress in realizing your “grand scheme.” By developing the scope 
of your potential obstacles, you are better equipped to identify these 
constraints and the necessary measures to remove them. 
Step 5. Learn To Provide Instant Value. In this era of unlimited access 
to information, free has become the new norm. This can be a challenge 
to those of you looking to start and build a business. Consumers are less 
trusting today than years past. As such, you have to identify ways of 
providing instant value, long before a transaction has ever taken place. 
You may have experienced this model with software companies. They 
typically provide free 30-day trials before the first payment is collected. 
In other cases, this comes in the form of educating your target audience 
or by delivering actual results before they ever become a client. In my 
own Internet marketing and lead generation business, I send leads to 
potential clients before they become paying customers. This model has 
allowed me to build trust quickly and avoid any possible objections to 
my services, which would otherwise require attention in a traditional 
prospecting scenario. If this step is appropriately executed it can make 
a significant impact on the authority of your business and how it is 
positioned relative to the competition.
In conclusion, the path of transformation is multi-faceted. The steps 
described above should not be construed as a formula; they are guidelines 
that can serve to make the journey more enjoyable and fulfilling. I can 
certainly say that these very steps allowed me to become a better man 
and a more effective entrepreneur, and, most importantly, a more present 
and loving father. For you, it ultimately begins with who you believe 
you can be.

CHAPTER 47
THE BEST INVESTMENT  
OPPORTUNITY  
AVAILABLE TODAY 
—THAT THRIVES IN  
BOTH GOOD AND BAD  
ECONOMIC TIMES
BY MIKE CONLON
In the late 1990’s, I owned a successful financial planning firm. If you 
remember that time, the stock market was in a big boom phase and 
everyone was scrambling to invest as much as they could in it. I had 
over $100 million in investable assets under management and nearly 
400 clients. However, the client that I remember most was one of my 
smallest clients. He worked at the local paper mill and never made more 
than $50,000 in any one year. He had a small IRA with me, but I knew 
he had more money to invest because he was a saver, pretty frugal, and 
hardworking. I had a couple meetings with him, but couldn’t convince 
him to invest more in the stock market. I asked him what he was doing 
with his extra money. He told me he was 50 years old and in the 10th 
year of his 15-year plan. His plan was buying an older, single-family 
house each year for around $50,000. He bought each house at a 15-20% 
discount from the market value because it needed work, which he was 
able to do himself and with a little help from some of his friends. He

428
said he could rent it for $500/month, which was a little below the market 
rent, and keep it rented because “in good times or bad times, there is 
always a need for affordable housing in this country.” His plan also 
included using all his profits to pay off his mortgage as soon as possible. 
Being young and naïve at the time, I thought he was crazy to invest in 
boring affordable housing because the stock market was averaging over 
20% returns each year.
I didn’t see that client again for five years. During that five-year period, 
the stock market lost nearly 40% of its value, with those invested in 
technology stocks losing much more. When I saw him, I asked the client 
how life was treating him. He said he had just put in his retirement 
papers at the mill because he now had 12 of the houses paid off and his 
net income, after all expenses were paid, was over $60,000/year, more 
than he ever made at the mill. More important, his net worth was now 
over $1 million. After hearing this, I thought to myself – why would 
you ever invest in the stock market when you could invest in affordable 
housing?
So I spent a couple months researching the real estate industry. My 
research more than validated my old client’s thesis that “affordable 
housing investments perform well in good and bad economic times.” 
So I did what at least 95% of the other investors won’t ever do – I 
took action! I sold my financial planning practice and started to invest 
in affordable housing. My research led me to buying multi-family 
investments, i.e., apartments or mobile home communities, because all 
your tenants are in one place, making it much easier to manage. For the 
first four years, I bought affordable apartment complexes in Orlando, FL 
with the intention of holding them for the long-term. However, prices 
soared so I sold all seven of my complexes by mid 2006 because I had 
received unsolicited offers that were way more than I had paid a couple 
years prior. Once I sold, I wanted to reinvest, but Florida prices were 
too high, so I looked around, and with strong input from one of my 
commercial brokers, I decided to invest in North Carolina. But instead 
of buying more apartment complexes, I started buying mobile home 
communities (MHC’s). I had no idea what MHC’s were in 2005, though 
I had probably driven by many through the years. However, I found 
some information in the internet that indicated MHC’s were better 
investments than apartments because, if they were well operated, they 
had much less turnover (i.e. residents moving in and out) and thus much 

429
THE BEST INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TODAY
less maintenance and repair expenses. So again I took action and bought 
an MHC and I did find it was much easier to manage than an apartment 
complex. So I kept buying them, mostly ones in distress from banks in 
2011 and 2012. I now own 25 communities with almost 3,000 spaces in 
five states with annual rent exceeding $7 million. I have also done 16 
full-cycle deals (buy, rehab, and sell) with sales proceeds in excess of 
$65 million. And best of all, I still work out of my house and rarely work 
more than 25 hours per week. 
How have affordable housing investments treated other investors? A 
man who sold me a 175-space mobile home community in Raleigh, NC 
never graduated from high school and actually lived in the community 
for 28 years. That community paid for his three kids’ college educations 
and he walked away from the sale with over $2 million (after tax) in his 
pocket. All from one community! Another guy I knew invested in three 
communities in California in the early 1970’s. He sold one community 
for over $30 million and the other community, which has no debt on it, 
generates a check for over $100,000…per month! to him and his family. 
Finally, I visited I guy I know who lives in Buffalo who started buying 
affordable apartment complexes in the early 1990’s. He now has over 
60 apartment complexes throughout the East Coast. When I visited him 
last, he showed me his car collection, which had grown to 86 collector 
cars – Ferrari’s, Aston Martin’s, old Mustang’s, etc. – pretty impressive. 
Investing in affordable housing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It is a 
great investment for long-term wealth, and one of the best for generating 
current passive income. The beauty of investing in affordable housing is 
that you don’t need thousands of units. If you want to make $100k per 
year, all you need are 130-150 apartment units, 90-100 MHC spaces, or 
35-40 single-family homes. This can be accomplished with one property 
or a couple properties. To obtain this type of cash flow from a property, 
you need to follow three important steps:
1. You make your money at the purchase. This phrase means you 
must understand your local market and find a property to buy that 
is trading below market prices. 
2. Cash Flow is king. You never buy a property that isn’t cash 
flowing day one. I can show you several ways to increase cash 
flow, but you never want the pressure of having to “feed” a 
negative cash flow property. 

TRANSFORM
430
3. Location. If possible, you need to buy properties within 20 
minutes of a major (200,000 people +) metro area, as that’s where 
the jobs are. The key to a successful affordable housing property 
is that your tenants have easy access to lots of jobs. 
Remember what my financial planning client said, that affordable 
housing does well in “good and bad times.” Since the economic 
meltdown of 2008-2009, the demand for affordable housing has gone 
through the roof as millions of people have been forced to downsize. 
At the same time, the supply of affordable housing is at an all-time 
low as there has been very little affordable housing built in this country 
over the last 20 years because the land and infrastructure costs are too 
expensive. This is an Economics 101 perfect storm: big demand with 
limited supply means prices are going up and occupancy levels are at all 
time highs, whether it be in affordable single-family houses, affordable 
apartment complexes, or manufactured home communities. And I don’t 
see any let up in this scenario as more and more middle class Americans 
fall into the lower class due to lower paying jobs and higher costs for 
everyday necessities like gas, groceries, education, health care, etc. 
Fortunately for my business, and unfortunately for the country (in my 
opinion), the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow wider, 
which increases the demand for affordable housing. More than 50% of 
the country is now in a household that makes less than $44,000/year, 
which means they can only afford $500-$700/month in total housing 
expenses. Recent statistics show that nine out of the ten most prevalent 
jobs needed in this country over the next 5-10 years will pay between 
$8-$12/hr. As one of my friends in the industry who, who used to be 
a Wall Street guy and quit to own affordable properties full-time, said 
recently, “I love waking up every day knowing the demand for my 
product is only getting stronger.” 
The greatest thing about investing in affordable housing is that you 
can be part of the solution as well. We provide our residents with safe, 
affordable housing in clean and well-kept communities. We make a 
strong effort to get residents involved with each other by sponsoring 
activities at all the major holidays, putting in new playgrounds and 
soccer fields, planting a community garden, and coordinating with local 
organizations, such as the Boys and Girls clubs and local food trucks, to 
provide services to our community. The biggest mistake you can make 
with affordable housing is not reinvesting in the complex or community. 

431
THE BEST INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TODAY
Re-paving the parking lots and/or community streets or rehabbing older 
apartments and/or homes every few years is a must. Slumlords are 
driven out of business quickly. Owners who treat their residents with 
respect (our policy is “firm, but fair”) and reinvest in their complexes or 
communities will be the ones that thrive. 
So how do you get started in affordable housing investments? Six steps:
1.	Get educated. Any good business requires hard work and basic 
principles you need to understand so you don’t make a big mistake 
on your first investment. You need to invest in education materials 
that provide a step-by-step process on how to invest in affordable 
housing.
2.	Find a mentor. You need someone with experience in the business 
who can guide you through your first couple investments.
3.	Select a geographic area where you want to invest. I like the 
Southeast and Midwest U.S., as they are more affordable. 
4.	Choose your affordable housing investment type. What do you 
feel more comfortable with – single-family homes (the easiest to 
get started with), apartment complexes (the easiest to get financed), 
or mobile home communities (the easiest to manage)? 
5.	Put together a team. You will need to find good local brokers, a 
local banker to finance your properties, a good CPA to handle your 
taxes, and a good property manager to oversee them. 
6.	Put together a plan. You will need a 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year 
plan that includes how many units you will buy, how much money 
it will take to acquire the units, how will you manage the units, etc. 
I have always found that written, measureable goals provide great 
accountability and are a great help to reaching your goals.

8 WAYS TO  
TRANSFORM YOUR “JUNK-
DRAWER FINANCIAL” INTO A 
BALANCED PLAN
BY JOHN HUTCHINSON, CHFC®, CLU®, EA
1. BALANCING YOUR EARNING EFFORTS  
WITH YOUR PLANNING EFFORTS
We’ve all seen sports teams that bought and recruited all the best 
talent in the world, but just can’t seem to capitalize on it? On paper 
they should be crushing the competition, but the team constantly 
finds themselves falling short.
The same is true with many of the financial situations I come across. 
High-income earners who have all the visible symptoms of success, but 
when you look inside their financial locker room, there’s a team divided 
and they’re well short of making a run at the post-season. Like the sports 
franchise they’ve assembled a flashy roster, but lacked the leadership to 
provide a cohesive game plan. 
Now I understand we’re all busy at our job or business, and when we 
leave all we really want is to spend time with our family and friends. 
That’s the way it should be. That’s why team owners hire tactical 
specialty coaches and a head coach who has a fluent grip on the various 
facets of the game to coordinate the efforts of the team as a whole.

TRANSFORM

Take Dave, the owner of a thriving construction company. Dave spent 
more time last year trying to save an extra couple hundred dollars on 
his vacations than he did with the tens and hundreds of thousands of 
profits that passed through his fingers each month. He loved planning 
his family trips, which felt much more tangible than pursuing solutions 
to distant financial goals that all seemed so confusing. The few financial 
planners he spoke to didn’t make sense to him, and he was sure they 
were just trying to sell him something.
It doesn’t have to be that way. There are planners out there who can 
explain things in a way that makes sense, using analogies from your 
own business. They can start with near term efficiencies to better handle 
cash management and major capital expenditures like equipment and 
materials. Tying that into medium and long-term strategies could help 
Dave fully enjoy the present moment with the confidence of knowing 
there’s a sustainable path to all his future moments that will someday 
be his now.
2. TRANSFORMING FRAGMENTED JUNK-DRAWER 
STRATEGIES INTO A COORDINATED BALANCED PLAN
The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going. 
~ Ralph Waldo Emerson
We find that over time clients have adopted several different isolated 
strategies for different reasons, something we refer to as “junk drawer 
financial planning.” All may have started with good intentions, but after 
years of neglect and auto-pilot they usually start working against each 
another, especially as life changes outside the junk drawer. Do all your 
different financial strategies still play nicely with each other? Did they 
ever? Or was each initiated in reaction to a situation or an emotional 
urge? 
Take Brian and Karen, a realtor and a controller for a medical device 
company. As new parents, they started aggressively pumping money 
into a tax-sheltered college savings plan, which on its own merits seemed 
wise. After two years they had to make some home repairs and took 
on consumer debt because they didn’t have sufficient liquid reserves 
to fund them. Sure their college accounts were growing tax-free, but if 
they took out any money they’d not only pay taxes, but penalties too. 
I look at these two fragmented financial decisions like having one foot 

435
8 WAYS TO TRANSFORM YOUR “JUNK-DRAWER FINANCIAL” INTO A BALANCED PLAN
on the gas and another on the brakes…not to mention the couple’s own 
retirement goals were drastically underfunded. If necessary their kids 
could borrow for college, but there’s no way Brian and Karen could 
borrow for their own retirement.
Find a planner who’s fit to give balanced advice and who can make sure 
all the dials of your different instruments are calibrated and facing due 
North. Adjustments will someday be necessary, so it’s paramount to find 
someone who is ethical and won’t undo whatever quality work that’s 
already in place.
3. GROUNDING COMMON OPINIONS  
WITH RELEVANT ADVICE 
Have you ever heard a raving movie review from a friend or the 
media, only to be completely disappointed upon seeing it? Movies 
aren’t inherently good or bad. They’re just 90 minutes of imagery 
and dialogue. Our varying backgrounds, attitudes, hopes, and 
dreams shape whether or not the movie resonates with us. 
Similarly some acquaintance or talking head can rave about certain 
financial strategies and slam others. Blanket opinions, however, are 
meaningless without the context of a particular situation. What are you 
trying to accomplish? How long can you allow for each strategy to 
blossom? What level of volatility are you comfortable with? Does this 
jive with what’s already in place?
Also, when it comes to mass media and “financial entertainers,” they 
aren’t compensated by helping you build the optimal plan. They are 
paid to capture your attention while their commercial sponsors attempt 
to influence the masses.. The higher your income is, the less relevant 
that common advice from the media or the Internet will likely be. Did 
you know that according to data compiled by www.taxfoundation.org 
in 2010, households who made over $161,579 were in the top 5% of 
all income earners in the United States? This elite group paid over 59% 
of the total federal taxes paid. Households making over $116,623 in 
2010 were in the top 10% of all income earners and paid over 70% 
of all federal taxes. Although you may not feel like one of the elite, 
your income is uncommon. The amount of tax you pay is uncommon. 
Therefore you may require customized advice, not just noisy opinions 
from media designed to captivate the masses.

4. IMPLEMENTING UNIQUE STRATEGIES VS. 
DIVERSIFYING SIMILAR PRODUCTS
Everyone’s heard not to put all their eggs in one basket, but if 
keeping our eggs safe is the goal, maybe consider containers other 
than baskets.
Most advisors would describe diversification as investing in multiple 
companies of different sizes in different industries from different parts 
of the world. Doing so should protect a portfolio from big losses and 
violent swings. 
How did that work out in 2008? How about the early 2000’s? You see 
diversifying in this manner may have been effective in decades past, but 
with the rise of technology and globalization the world has become a 
much smaller place. When there’s turmoil somewhere in the world, we 
feel the economic tremors everywhere. 
In 2008, there was no place to hide. Everything was down: stocks, 
bonds, real estate, commodities, even the safe-haven of money markets 
was threatened momentarily. Traditional portfolios were chopped by 
30%-50% within 12 months, and that is by no means a record with all 
the financial damage that occurred. 
We tell our clients to “Diversify by Strategy.” What does that mean? For 
your investments in the market, instead of owning ten different funds 
that trend on a similar path, we recommend using different institutional 
managers with different methodologies. Some managers have a track 
record of regularly outperforming the market while others are adept at 
avoiding large losses. For instance, there are a couple different managers 
we use that each lost less than 1% in 2008, yet still had very favorable 
returns in the years before and after that. 
Another way to diversify by strategy is to layer in some products that offer 
contractual guarantees for either principal protection, a baseline growth

rate, a future income stream, or possibly even all three. Having multiple 
unique strategies allows you to stick to your plan with confidence unlike 
having all your money floating in the exact same global risk pool. If 
the sky starts falling again like it did twice last decade, you won’t get 
shaken out of your investments and miss the rise of the Phoenix.
5. BALANCING YOUR TAXATION ALLOCATION FOR A 
DISTRIBUTION-FRIENDLY RETIREMENT
It’s not how much you make, but how much you can keep that matters.
For all the talk about diversification, the one area I find it completely 
MIA is in my clients’ tax strategies. Since taxes can wipe out somewhere 
between one quarter to one half of your wealth building efforts, 
doesn’t this deserve equally as much attention as the growth strategies 
themselves? 
So how does one balance the taxation allocation? We’re all for accounts 
that reduce our current tax liability, especially for higher-income earners. 
However, if the only places you’re investing are inside accounts that 
defer taxes until the future, this can be a recipe for disaster. 
Take Craig, a partner at a mid-sized accounting firm. He’d been told 
his entire life to maximize his 401(k) at work since he would be at a 
lower tax bracket in retirement, like it was a given. He also encouraged 
his other partners to layer in an additional defined benefit plan where 
his company could avoid paying tax on annual profits by aggressively 
socking away this money for retirement on a pretax basis. One of the 
junior partners will soon be buying out Craig over the first 5 years of 
his retirement. 
Craig was very responsible deferring income into the 401(k) plan, plus 
the company defined benefit contributions. Both of these plans avoided 
tax during the working years, but will be fully taxable upon distribution. 
The buyout money will be taxable as well as his income from rental 
property he owns. Because of his success, 85% of his Social Security 
checks will also be taxable. 
Not only that, but Craig will be losing some key tax deductions in 
retirement that he’s been enjoying during his working years. His kids are 
grown up, the mortgage will be paid off, and certain fringe benefits he 
ran through the business won’t be deductible anymore. So even though 

TRANSFORM
438
Craig may be planning to live off say 75% of his final year’s income, 
Craig might very well find himself heading right back up to those higher 
tax brackets he diligently planned to avoid during his working years.
Had he diverted some of his saving and investing efforts to tax advantaged 
accounts like a Roth IRA/Roth 401(k), certain municipal bonds, or Cash 
Value Life Insurance Contracts, Craig could have better controlled his 
tax situation in retirement. You see, those three vehicles mentioned 
above all can produce growth and distributions that are sheltered from 
taxation.* If they’re in place, you can toggle and control your annual 
tax liability by balancing taxable distributions from retirement accounts 
with a layer of tax-free distributions. If taxes go up, this balancing effect 
becomes even more powerful.
6. SUPPORTING GROWTH WITH PROTECTION
In business, I look for economic castles  
protected by unbreachable ‘moats.’  
~ Warren Buffet
When so much time and energy is spent growing wealth, it’s absolutely 
vital to incorporate defensive strategies to protect it. Since the divide 
between the haves and the have-nots keeps widening, and we are by far 
the most litigious society on the planet, the concept of asset protection 
is essential. That could mean very intricate trust planning strategies, or 
it could simply mean choosing certain account types that have inherent 
creditor protection afforded to them by state and federal governments. 
How do you think OJ was able to be golfing in Florida despite the multi-
million dollar judgment against him? The level of protection will vary 
depending on the state and the account type, but this is one aspect to 
consider when balancing your wealth building.
Another defensive facet to consider is contingency planning. Often 
times our clients have a strong steady income and a growing asset-base 
where, so long as nothing catastrophic happens, they’ll have the game 
won. Layering in certain insurance products that protect against the loss 
of a major breadwinner’s income and/or the inflated expense of long-
term nursing care can be a prudent financial decision. 
*Roths, Muni Bonds, and Permanent Life Insurance all have certain stipulations that need to be followed 
in order to retain their tax-exempt status. All three have unique risks to be aware of, so be sure to consult 
an advisor that can offer educated insights on each to determine the best mix for you.

439

When viewed as a hedge to carve off say 5% of one’s wealth building 
efforts to protect the other 95%, clients can usually find some balance of 
wealth building and hedging they’re comfortable with. 
7. BALANCING NOW AND LATER
Forever is composed of nows.  
~ Emily Dickinson
Let’s just be clear that we are big proponents of living a fulfilling life 
in the present. That said, all of us will have to slow down at some point 
as our skills in the marketplace become less valuable. That’s why we 
save and invest for retirement. Ideally, someday our money at work 
can replace us at work. Anytime we tap into our retirement accounts or 
delay contributing to them, we are borrowing from our future. This is 
where we work with clients to create some balance, and it doesn’t need 
to be an either/or question.
Despite the fact that all the great advertising agencies of the world lead 
us to believe we need a myriad of products to attain happiness, we know 
that’s not true. Our clients have found that laying out a monthly budget 
of their true needs, adding in some wants, and even building in a little 
extra cushion can be quite an eye-opening exercise. 
I want to show you how powerful budgeting can be using a simple 
example:
Let’s just say that somebody earns $100,000 a year, and saves $10,000 
or 10% of their income. Now suppose this same individual is a very 
savvy investor and earns a 10% rate of return (net of fees, trading 
costs, and taxes due on the gains) earning them $1000 on that $10,000 
saved. What if the same individual found a way through budgeting and 
efficiency to save even just an extra 2% of their gross annual income 
without compromising their quality of life? That would equal $2000, 
2% of $100,000. Notice that through efficiency, our saver managed to 
effectively increase the rate of growth on their initial savings by 20% 
($10,000 x 20% = $2,000). 

TRANSFORM
440
Gross Income

$10,000
10% ROR 
$1,000
Saving an Extra 2%  
of Gross Income
$2,000
= 20% of Initial Annual Savings
That’s double the somewhat optimistic investment rate of return, and 
obviously budgeting requires significantly less risk than trying to earn  
consistent double-digit growth rates on a consistent basis.
8. MAINTAINING THE BALANCE. KEEPING IT ALL 
TOGETHER
Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans.  
~ John Lennon
It’s important to find a financial planner that’s more like a pilot than a 
ticket agent. A ticket agent sells you a ticket, you get on that plane, and 
they’re gone. The pilot on the other hand stays in communication with 
the passengers and constantly adjusts in real time for the ever-shifting 
currents. The originally plotted course is never adhered to after the onset 
of the journey (just like those static financial plans). 
Has life changed much since you last bought your last ticket?

LEADERSHIP TRANSFORMATION
CHAPTER 49
LEADERSHIP 
TRANSFORMATION
BY LARRY SZELIGA
As a manager, have you ever found yourself in a position where you felt 
overwhelmed? Where you were working harder than ever before and 
still were not generating the results that were expected of you? Where 
you were putting in more and more hours at work and having less and 
less time for family, friends, and personal enjoyment? Where your 
frustration level was so high that you hated your job and was dissatisfied 
with life in general?
Not long ago this was exactly my state of mind. My situation was 
amplified by the fact that in the various management positions I have 
held over the years, from First-line Production Supervisor to Chief 
Executive Officer, I was “golden,” so to speak. I have worked in 
large publicly-traded companies, family-owned businesses, and small 
entrepreneurial enterprises. The companies I worked for included: 
DataRam, Inc., General Motors, DICO, Inc., Titan Wheel International, 
Inc., and OTR Wheel Engineering, Inc. It seemed that no matter what 
initiative I undertook, I was always successful. I appeared to have the 
proverbial Midas touch.
Since 1974, when I was first promoted into the ranks of management, 
the subject of leadership has been on my radar. I was infatuated with 
the importance of being able to influence and inspire others to achieve 

TRANSFORM
444
a common goal. In addition to the practical knowledge I gained 
as a manager, I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor of 
Leadership and author of Clear Leadership, Gervase Bushe, PhD. I 
also earned a Master’s Degree in Organizational and Human Resource 
Development from American University which provided an academic 
dimension to my philosophical position that a leader’s success was 
directly proportional to their ability to help those they are leading 
succeed in achieving their goals.
In 1986, I put this academic and practical knowledge to work as an 
independent consultant, and founded IQSS, LLC. My clients included, 
but were not limited to: General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, 
Saturn, GE Medical, Shasta Beverages, Westinghouse Oceanic and 
Colgate-Palmolive. Helping others implement my philosophies toward 
leadership always generated positive results.
After 40 years of management experience, I could tell you a host of 
success stories that would be very impressive in any chapter about 
leadership. However, the real story I want to tell is a personal one, 
because about ten years ago, my golden streak of successes began to fade. 
I found myself struggling to achieve my objectives. I wasn’t producing 
the same level of success I had previously experienced. Something had 
changed. It felt like I was losing more battles than I was winning. That 
was a new and unsettling dynamic for me. I wasn’t exactly sure how or 
why it happened. My professional life had become one of confusion and 
frustration rather than success and fulfillment.
As time wore on, I felt as if I were caught in a downward spiral of 
being disheartened and exasperated. I was ill-tempered and moody. 
I blamed my lack of success on the incompetence of my people and 
an overwhelming workload. Needless to say, I was not pleasant to be 
around. In my mind, everyone was responsible for my less-than-stellar-
performance, my diminishing success rate, and my extended hours. I 
was shocked and disgusted by the apparent level of incompetence that 
surrounded me. 
Being naturally competitive and driven to succeed, I could not accept this. 
I found myself working harder and longer hours than ever before. I still 
met most of my objectives, but I did so through personal determination 
and individual contribution. The feedback I received from my peers 

445
LEADERSHIP TRANSFORMATION
made it clear that I was not meeting the overall needs of the organization 
or the expectations of the owner. The reality was that I had lost sight of 
the fact that my personal contribution could not be the winning factor 
for a team’s long-term success.
I began entertaining thoughts of leaving the company. After all, I knew 
I could find someplace worthy of my talents. I needed a company where 
I could again thrive and where my proven abilities would once again be 
appreciated. In fact, the more I thought about leaving, the better I liked 
the idea. So I started trying to define the ideal company that would fit 
my needs. As I worked through this exercise, I began to notice that the 
characteristics of the company I was currently working for were a pretty 
close match to the ideal company I was trying to define. 
That’s when it dawned on me that it wasn’t the company I was working 
for, its strategic plan, or the employees that were at fault. The reality 
was that I was already working for a good company and with some very 
good people. Through my pursuit of wanting to run to a better place, I 
came to the very uncomfortable realization that I was the root cause of 
my own ineffectiveness. 
This pain of failure and frustration was a catalyst for starting an 
introspective journey that would change my life. I wanted to understand 
what had changed in the time lapse between my history of abundant 
successes and my current success drought. No matter how I approached 
this pertinent question, the answer was always the same. It was ME! I 
had changed and it wasn’t for the better. This awareness was one of the 
most important awakenings I have ever experienced. It was also the 
beginning of some very penetrating, painful, and beneficial self-analysis 
that would eventually lead to a personal and professional transformation. 
I turned to people I trusted and who would give me honest feedback 
and responses to my questions about my attitudes and behaviors toward 
leadership. Their answers were straight up, objective, relevant, and 
non-judgemental. I started to bounce thoughts, ideas, questions and 
experiences off my wife, Stephanie, who never failed to give me her 
unadulterated feedback; two of my closest cohorts: Andie Huberty and 
Tom Pitman; my very first mentor, Gervase Bushe; and my Life Coach, 
Jackie Bsharah. In addition to giving me straight up feedback, they 
frequently asked me questions about how I felt, how I interpreted some 

TRANSFORM
446
of my recent experiences, and how I reacted to those experiences. Their 
questions, challenges, and insights helped me to pull everything together 
into an integrated approach to leadership that not only made sense, but 
also worked with amazing speed, consistency, and most importantly, 
with long-lasting results time and time again. I was transformed!
What happened as a result was amazing! Everything began to fall into 
place and started making sense. I found myself riding a wave of successes 
that was unprecedented in my work experience. I was witnessing rapid 
and continuous improvement in every initiative I launched. I was 
working fewer hours and experiencing more successes. I found that I 
was happier and I had more balance in my life. 
“So, what changed?” The answer is: a whole host of things – beliefs, 
attitudes, behaviors and methods. But, one of the most significant things 
was that I was finally understanding the leadership process and learning 
more about it every day. I realized that I had been pushing my people for 
results rather than inspiring, intriguing, and enabling them to succeed.
I realized that leadership is about helping those you are leading succeed 
in achieving their goals and objectives. It is not about the contribution 
or achievement of the leader. It is about the success their people have 
in the attainment of a common goal. Inevitably, their successes lead 
to the leader’s success. This insight helped me realize that it was my 
responsibility to help my people generate results and meet their goals 
… to succeed!
As I applied my new insights on effective leadership, I found that 
people I had previously thought to be of questionable ability were 
suddenly becoming superstars. Others who previously tended to avoid 
me as their boss were seeking me out and asking for my involvement. 
Suggestions for improvement were forthcoming from multiple avenues. 
The organization seemed alive with excitement, positive feedback and 
employee engagement. And, I was actually having fun. 
While I could write an entire book on my experience and what I have 
learned, I would like to focus on three principles that are Key to effective 
leadership: Establish a Foundation for Trust, Set a Compelling Goal, 
and Create a Supportive Environment. 

447
LEADERSHIP TRANSFORMATION
ESTABLISH A FOUNDATION FOR TRUST
There is a significant difference between managing people (making sure 
they do what they were hired to do) and leading people (influencing 
people to achieve specific outcomes). Being an effective leader begins 
with knowing yourself. I found this out the hard way. I had lost sight of 
the fact that my previous successes were the direct result of my ability to 
help the people I was leading to succeed. Instead, I was focused on and 
enamored with my own success. I had lost track of who I was and what 
was important to me; my values, beliefs, needs, and wants.
Furthermore, I had lost track of what was important to my people, 
or maybe it would be more accurate to say that I stopped caring. To 
correct this, I made a conscious effort to be attentive to the values, 
beliefs, needs and wants of the people in my work world. I got to know 
them and establish communications at a level that was deeper than a 
casual, “Hello, how are you?” As a result, we developed a mutual trust. 
Without trust and deep communications it would be very difficult (if 
not impossible) to intrigue, inspire, and influence people to achieve the 
outcomes required by the organization.
Additionally, the leader must recognize that attending to the needs, wants, 
and expectations of those they are leading, means making sure that the 
people get credit for their achievements; are fairly compensated; and are 
adequately rewarded with positive affirmation for their contributions to 
the achievement of the common goals. 
Once the deep communications and trust are established, it is time to 
introduce them to a Compelling Goal.
SET A COMPELLING GOAL
The second Key to effective leadership is having a Compelling Goal 
(mission, objective, or task), that is: an intended outcome that attracts 
strong interest and attention. During my self-evaluation, I discovered 
that I held my people accountable for the fulfillment of their job 
responsibilities and daily duties, but I failed to set a Compelling Goal 
that was important to the success of the organization. As a result, my 
people functioned as if they were on autopilot. Their Goal had become 
one of “surviving the day.”

TRANSFORM
448
In order to create a Compelling Goal, the leader must make sure that 
the Goal is clear and achievable, and the people charged with achieving 
it must think and feel that it is legitimate, personally relevant, and that 
they have the discretion to determine how they will accomplish it.
This is also one area where the Leader’s personal values, needs, and 
wants come in to play. I mentioned previously that the leader must be 
authentic and congruent, i.e. the leader’s actions should match their 
words. I realized that I had repeatedly violated this responsibility. In one 
instance, for example, I clearly stated my value: “that we would operate 
our business with a “quality first” attitude.” Then a situation arose where 
the product available to ship was not in compliance with the customer’s 
specifications. It was the last day of the month, revenues were below 
target and I knew that the customer would probably not even notice that 
the product was not completely to print. I said, “Let’s take the chance 
and ship the product.” I hit my sales target, but I also sent a very clear 
message to my people that quality was not first. I was neither authentic 
nor congruent. My actions did not match my words. Inauthenticity and 
incongruence betrays the trust of the people the manager is leading,
Beyond Setting a Compelling Goal, the effective leader must 
demonstrate an unwavering commitment to its attainment. There may 
be times where difficult, unpopular decisions will have to be made. 
It is imperative that the leader demonstrates the resolve to make 
these decisions and take actions necessary to assure the successful 
completion of the Compelling Goal.
CREATE A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT
I define all of the external factors influencing the life, work, and activities 
of people as the Environment. The third Key to effective leadership is 
Creating a Supportive Environment, where others in the organization 
feel the Goal is legitimate to the wellbeing of the organization, will 
respond to the needs of those involved in achieving the Goal, and reward 
them appropriately. 
An effective leader will create an environment that supports the efforts of 
their people, where they do not feel they are at risk if they try something 
new, where they are able to get the resources they need, and where they 
are expected to succeed. This requires the leader to network with others 
who control vital information and necessary resources—listen to the 

449
LEADERSHIP TRANSFORMATION
needs of their people, reward their efforts and progress, and identify and 
remove roadblocks.
Yes, there will be roadblocks. That’s just part of the real world. Effective 
leaders do whatever it takes to assure the success of their people. That 
means that if there is something impeding the ability of the people to 
achieve their goal, it is the leader’s responsibility to remove whatever 
it is that is inhibiting their progress. In the words of the great NBA 
standout, Michael Jordan, “If you’re trying to achieve, there will be 
roadblocks. I’ve had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don’t 
have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don’t turn around and give up. 
Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.” 
CONCLUSION
Leaders can significantly increase their potential to succeed if they 
realize that their success is directly proportional to the success of their 
people. Therefore, the more a leader can do to increase the opportunities 
for their people to achieve their Goals, the more success the leader 
will experience. Leaders who want to escalate the success potential 
of their people will “Establish a Foundation for Trust.” They will “Set 
Compelling Goals.” They will “Create a Supportive Environment.” 
These leaders will do whatever it takes to assure the success of their 
people in the attainment of their Goals, and those who do will experience 
new levels of rapid and ongoing success. In fact, they will create a 
Culture of Success.

BYSTANDERS AND INTEGRITY—MY TRANSFORMATION
CHAPTER 50
BYSTANDERS AND  
INTEGRITY 
—MY TRANSFORMATION
BY JOHN DEWEY
There I stood, frozen and not moving, sixty feet up, on top of a narrow 
rock wall. The next few moments changed my life forever.  
~ John Dewey
When I was seventeen years old, I participated in a twenty-one day 
backpacking trip in the Beartooth Mountain range of Montana. The trip 
was organized by a Wisconsin-based summer camp. The group consisted 
of eight seventeen-year-old males and two adult leaders.
One of the leaders was a former camper and college student. This was 
typical as students and teachers had summers off to lead trips like this. 
The other leader was not typical at all. I knew it the moment I laid eyes 
on him. He was the most physically fit human being I had ever met in 
my life. His name was Kermit and he was a former Green Beret in the 
United States Army who had spent the past four years leading an elite 
rescue team in the Alps. He was acutely aware of what led to success or 
failure in the mountains and he did not waste any time conveying the 
very basics to the group. Kermit’s demeanor was calm, self-assured, and 
not at all what I would have imagined of an elite soldier. 
At that time, I was a high school athlete but I was not prepared for his 
improvised boot camp. Early in the morning, he led us on nine-mile 
runs, did push-ups, sit-ups, and stretching. Wisconsin summers can be 

TRANSFORM
452
quite humid and this was one of the most humid summers on record. The 
humidity brought bugs and they were out in full force. Moments without 
a mosquito buzzing in my ear were few and far between. We whined and 
complained a bit in the beginning, but quickly started feeling the pride 
of being part of a budding and cohesive team.
We had five days in base camp to organize ourselves before our four-
day drive to Montana. Those days were filled with navigation exercises, 
basic weather reading, organizing meals, and checking tents, backpacks 
and route planning. We also learned some basic rock climbing skills 
using some of the equipment. I must admit that I was not focused and 
struggled to pay attention at times. I also had a tendency to “wing it” 
at that age and worried more about looking good than actually asking 
questions and really understanding what was going on. 
We headed west five days later on Interstate 80. On the second day, we 
arrived in the Black Hills of South Dakota, the site of Mt. Rushmore. 
After we hiked around the monument and took pictures, it was time to 
find a campsite and do some rock climbing. Local guides pointed us to 
a favorite area for climbing and we set up camp. Next we found a good 
spot to do some climbing. 
Rock climbing requires certain pieces of equipment for safety. The first 
piece is a harness, which each leg goes through and secures around 
the waist. A figure eight loop secures the rope to the harness. The rope 
passes through climbing protection, which is either permanently or 
temporarily attached to the rocks. There is another person involved who 
is the belayer. The belayer is the security person on the rope who keeps 
the climber safe. The belayer has a belay device, which allows them to 
adjust the amount of friction in the rope. If necessary, they can stop the 
climber from falling.
We used a top belay, which means that the safety person was on top 
of the rock that the person was climbing. There I was, sixty feet up a 
rock wall. I was belaying for our leader, Kermit. There were two other 
people near me doing their own belays. Things were going fine for a 
while. When he was about fifteen feet from the top, I got mixed up in 
the ropes. I panicked. I started pulling the wrong end of the rope so there 
was a pile of slack in the rope and he was attached to the downside of 
that slack. I didn’t know what to do and I froze. Kermit kept climbing 

453
BYSTANDERS AND INTEGRITY—MY TRANSFORMATION
and, moments later, he got to the top and saw the pile of slack in the 
rope. He said, “What is that?” I didn’t know what to say except that 
I was sorry and I hadn’t known what to do. His piercing green eyes 
focused on mine and he calmly and clearly said “Next time, you need 
to stop the climber, make sure that they are secure on the rock face, and 
get the rope straightened out…You can’t ever let that happen again, do 
you understand?” He did not yell at me or shame me. The reality was 
that, if he had fallen, he most likely would have died. I had stood by, 
in that moment, and it could have killed him. My fear of looking stupid 
or not looking good got in the way of doing the right thing. I secretly 
hoped that someone else might have figured out my mistake and saved 
the situation. I was a bystander and I had never been so scared in all of 
my life.
I slept very little that night. I kept reliving my mistake over and over 
in my head. At first, I just beat up on myself for making such a stupid 
mistake. After I tired of my self-abuse, I got around to asking myself 
what I was going to do differently in my life. 
Five days later, one of my fellow campers slipped and broke his ankle. 
He was in a great deal of pain and I was right behind him when it 
happened. I immediately called for help, pulled his pack off and got 
him comfortable. We camped right there for the night while the leaders 
formulated a plan to get him out. The next day we were down to one 
leader and seven campers.
Near the end of the trip we did a twenty-four hour solo experience. We 
each left the group at noon and returned 24 hours later. We were given 
coordinates on where we needed to go so as not to find our friends and 
cheat the solo experience. This also allowed Kermit to know precisely 
where we were in case of an emergency. 
Right before I departed, I was confronted again with that sinking feeling 
of not knowing something. This time it was a lack of confidence in my 
navigation skills. Rather than sweeping it under the rug, avoiding it, 
or winging it, yet again, I told Kermit that I was not comfortable and I 
wanted to go over his navigation instructions again. I said this in front 
of everyone else. I believed, in that moment, that I was the only one 
who didn’t know what he was doing. I felt stupid and inadequate but 
this time my feelings of inadequacy did not get the best of me. I stepped

up and asked him for help. He started to explain it again and, almost 
immediately, three of my fellow campers joined in to watch and listen. 
The next evening, one of my fellow campers told me how grateful he 
was that I had stepped up and asked for instruction again, because he 
was not comfortable with his own navigation skills either. He said that he 
was too afraid to ask again because he thought that it had been covered 
enough, and he didn’t want to look stupid. I told him that Kermit was 
not that way, and that it was more important to him that we know and 
understand what we were doing.
I left on my solo feeling much more confident with my navigation skills 
and knowing that I had done the right thing. Kermit taught me about 
integrity and that facing my fears, regardless of the situation, was the 
right thing to do. 
Years later, while I was in graduate school, I was reminded of Kermit and 
my experience in the mountains after reading about Kitty Genovese. On 
March 13, 1964, something happened that drew a great deal of attention 
from social psychologists; in separate attacks spread over a 30-minute 
period, 29-year-old Kitty Genovese was stabbed, robbed, raped and 
ultimately murdered on a residential street in Queens, New York. Many 
neighbors and onlookers watched and listened as these attacks took place, 
taking no action whatsoever. Although her story was an urban legend 
magnified by a New York newspaper, it inspired social psychologists 
Bibb Latané and John Darley to develop the term “bystander effect” – 
wherein both diffusion of responsibility and social influence affect the 
way people do or don’t act when others are in danger.
Diffusion of responsibility happens when onlookers fail to act if there 
are a number of other people around . . . after all, with plenty of other 
people who can step in, why should they? This could also be called the 
“well, don’t look at me” effect. And social influence can be summarized 
as the “what’s everybody else doing?” effect. If no one else is making a 
move, then you’re sure not going to risk putting your own butt out there. 
Right?
I do my best not to be a bystander anymore but it is always challenging. 
In my work with wealthy families, individuals and their advisors no one 
is in danger of being stabbed, except possibly in the back. But maybe 
someone, something, or some tradition is actually at risk and if someone 

455
BYSTANDERS AND INTEGRITY—MY TRANSFORMATION
doesn’t step up, individuals, the family, or the business will suffer. It 
could be that the CEO, otherwise known as Grandpa Toby, is making 
strange decisions or your brother, the CFO, seems oblivious to the 
downward turn in revenue. You could inform the board of directors, but 
you hold off, waiting for someone else to do it, especially since there is a 
good chance that the board, made up of more relatives, is more likely to 
blame you, the one who steps forward, for their own discomfort, and not 
Grandpa Toby. So, mentally, you avert your eyes; emotionally, you tune 
out. What’s holding you back from acting? Is it that you are a coward, 
or could this be the bystander effect? 
The truth is that if you huddle in silence, within the relative safety 
of the group, you’re not doing the focus of your concern any favors. 
However, if you are afraid to open your mouth on your own, you could 
take advantage of the group and speak with one voice. After all, mobs 
enjoy a certain amount of anonymity. Get together, discuss what is on 
all of your minds and formulate a plan. Now, unless you intend to form 
a collective voice - a Greek chorus of sorts – then certainly one person 
will have to do the talking. But at least that person will have back up. 
And perhaps Grandpa Toby or brother Bart will be grateful; they may 
have been holding their breath, waiting for the axe to fall. You never can 
tell and if you remain silent you never will. I had Kermit to mentor me 
and he taught me how to step up and do the right thing.

About John
John states: Trillions of dollars will pass from generation to 
generation over the next forty years; I’ve seen first-hand what 
happens when a lack of wealth planning issues are either 
ignored or only glimpsed, without thorough thought. Families 
can be torn apart, divorce becomes more prevalent, children 
lose communication with parents and grandparents. Siblings might stop speaking to 
each other. Most, if not all, of this family discord can be avoided.
John Dewey offers both personal and professional insight into the world of high 
net worth multigenerational families, especially those with family businesses. He 
is one of several third generation heirs of a successful construction company and 
has experienced the psychological challenges that wealth and family business often 
causes. 
After a painful meltdown of relationships in his own family and the successful 
intervention of a family wealth coach more than twenty years ago, John dedicated 
his life to helping others in his somewhat unique position. He holds a master’s degree 
in psychology and his doctoral dissertation addressed the benefits and challenges of 
privilege.
John and Maureen have been married for twenty years and have four children. 
Together they have experienced many challenges in determining how to encourage 
their children to grow and develop in an environment where assets are plentiful. 
The Dewey family lives in rural Minnesota in a renovated barn; they are active in their 
church and Boy Scouts and they value their community. John advocates, educates 
and coaches high net worth families, heirs, and their advisors. 
John is passionate about breaking the self-imposed silence that plagues many 
families. He works to strengthen family members, as individuals and participants with 
a unique heritage, allowing them to prosper from generation to generation through

CHANGE YOUR OUTLOOK,

NOW IS YOUR TIME TO  
LIVE HAPPY!
BY EVAN KLASSEN
Trans-form:
-- change something dramatically: to change somebody or something completely
-- undergo total change: to change completely for the better
-- convert something to different energy: to convert one form of energy to

Insanity is doing the same thing over and  
over again, and expecting a different result.  
~ Albert Einstein
We all know it, we’ve all heard it, and yet, so many of us are still stuck. 
We WANT something different. We WANT to be healthier. We WANT 
to be more secure. We WANT a better relationship… In short, we 
WANT to be happier, but we keep doing the same things over and over 
again, living and reliving the same mistakes, frustrated, unhealthy and 
unhappy, somehow expecting a different result.

458
How do I know? I was there. Actually, I was born there!
I was born as one of nine children in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the poorest 
country in Central Asia to a German father and a Ukrainian mother. At 
that time, Tajikistan was a country torn by civil war, poverty, communism 
and racial strife. 
Since I was five, I remember feeling not welcome in the world I lived in. 
Everything around me was telling me I was a second class citizen, and 
I bought into it, even at that young age. I began cultivating a strategy 
to survive: I became Nice. Not just nice, but Nice with a capital ‘N’. I 
began spending my energy on finding something special in every person 
I met. Even with my enemies, I found some nice points, and this became 
my coping mechanism to avoid hatred and persecution. It was my secret 
weapon.
In this way, I was able to navigate a slippery path through my challenging 
childhood until our eventual escape and emigration to Germany. Along 
the way, some of the people – even one-time enemies – became friends. 
In these small victories, I found a happiness that became my escape 
from low self-esteem.
In 1992, I took the mandatory German school entrance exam and was 
downgraded a grade. Suddenly, in one of the clearest ways possible for 
a scared, immigrant eight-year old kid, I was told I wasn’t smart enough 
to be with my friends my age. Talk about a confirmation of one’s lack 
of self-worth! 
I fell back on my old strategy of finding the good in others in my school; 
if I could turn them in to my friends, no matter that the friendship was 
primarily one-sided, I could fit in.
Over the next few years, I became good at finding something special 
about every person I met, and when I did, that was when I was my 
happiest. I had friends of all shapes, colors and creeds, despite our 
obvious and glaring differences. I was able to find a common ground 
and we were able to ignore the other details like our religions, traditions, 
families, etc… you know, the small things. The truth was I had many 
acquaintances but no real childhood friends. No one was close to me as I 
was afraid to let them get close enough to see the real me, the unworthy 
Evan inside, as I was ashamed of who I was.

459
CHANGE YOUR OUTLOOK, CHANGE YOUR LIFE! NOW IS YOUR TIME TO LIVE HAPPY!
I started working at age 11, in part to help support my family, but also, in 
a way, to run away and continue to hide from my pain. By the age of 14, 
I was working three jobs along with my schooling. I would leave home 
before sunrise, and some nights, I wouldn’t return until after midnight. 
I was running from my challenges.
Despite the shallow friendships and the minor business successes I was 
having, inside, I was still stuck in my battle against my own low self-
esteem. It became part of my daily prayer, asking God that if He loved 
me, why had He made me so worthless.
I also became a very good actor. I was able to hide my feelings and 
needs behind a façade of social skills so even my family was not aware 
of my fears. I was the social one, the happy one, but it was all a coping 
mechanism. I mastered what I called the “Seven minute friendship:” 
I would meet someone, and within five to seven minutes, try to make 
them a friend before moving on. I felt that if I spent more than seven 
minutes with them, they would start to find out I wasn’t smart, that I 
wasn’t really as confident as I let on. I spent the first 21 years of my life 
in secret shame of who I was.
Then, as so often happens, the world caught up to me. I was completely 
controlled by what others thought of me. My self-esteem—or lack of 
it—dictated everything in my life. I was burning the candle at both ends, 
and would have lit a third one if I could have. Even as I continued to put 
on my social face, I slowly began to slip further into major depression, 
until at my lowest point, I wanted to end my life, as I couldn’t see the 
light at the end of the tunnel.
God answers prayers in three ways: 1) Yes, 2) No, and 3) Not yet; and 
when I was at my lowest, when I had been broken down to nothing, He 
finally started to answer my prayers. A college friend invited me to a 
business event, and I said “yes.” It was as if the lights came on and the 
gates were opened! 
Not only had I discovered personal development, that night I also found 
entrepreneurship, and my life had a new course. One of the mentors I 
met that night gave me a copy of two audio books that literally started to 
transform my life, one day at a time. The first was Napoleon Hill’s Think 
and Grow Rich, and the second was Brian Tracy’s 21 Secrets to Success. 
They started me on an amazing new journey, and suddenly, instead of 

TRANSFORM
460
shame, the world was filled with endless possibilities.
At this point in my life, I had never heard of personal development or 
entrepreneurship, and the idea that there were books and audio books 
and seminars on how to grow personally was a foreign and awesome 
revelation.
It has been said many times that when the student is ready, the teacher 
will appear, and my friends, this student must have been ready! 
I came across the startling and amazing idea that what we think, 
rather than what others think can influence our lives, and that it’s our 
opportunity and responsibility to think positively about ourselves. In 
short, what others think is not the metric that defines my self-worth.
The books allowed me to look at my life differently. I was able to look at 
life through the eyes of people who had created and lived success, rather 
than just through my own, which were full of my perceived failures, and 
colored by my low self-esteem. These authors and leaders became my 
silent mentors.
I was able to compound a few small victories and these books and 
events helped me shift my philosophy and beliefs. It definitely wasn’t 
overnight, and there were certainly setbacks, but little by little I was 
able to look at situations differently.
I discovered that life is much like looking at the world through a camera: 
you can focus intently on certain things, whether good or bad, and that 
if you don’t take a step back, that narrow focus robs us of the entire 
experience, and can influence the meaning we give to it. The other 
side of the camera analogy is that we have control over what we focus 
on: for example, if you only focus on people being sad, or your own 
unhappiness, or, conversely, if you focus on joy and happiness, your 
outlook – your attitude – is influenced.
It wasn’t until the age of 29, when I was co-authoring my first book 
“Think and Grow Rich Today” that I discovered that my skill of finding 
something special in every person I met, which had once been my 
protection mechanism, but now became a huge asset in connecting to 
the hearts of people. However, instead of doing it to assuage my own 
lack of self-worth, I was now using it to help others to discover the 
good about themselves. I became so intent on helping others be happy, 

461
CHANGE YOUR OUTLOOK, CHANGE YOUR LIFE! NOW IS YOUR TIME TO LIVE HAPPY!
regardless of their situation, that it has become my life’s mission!
It turns out that God had spent 25 years developing my networking 
skills and teaching me how to touch people positively. Now I live to 
“empower people to live happy,” by helping them find something great 
within themselves, and loving them from the heart. Now, instead of 
making a friend in seven minutes and moving on, I started to focus on 
transformational friendships.
I began to live life to the fullest. I gained a purpose and began to 
understand my life and who I was.
My life has come full circle, as I have now had the opportunity to 
contribute to both of the amazing authors who started my life on this 
new journey. A year ago, I was blessed beyond belief by being asked 
to co-author the new Think and Grow Rich Today, featuring Napoleon 
Hill. As I was working on my writing, I started looking at my past and 
was able to give a new, empowering meaning to the difficult events that 
happened. We can’t change our past, but we can certainly change what 
this past means to us. 
One of the keys is to start looking at our roadblocks and using them 
as building blocks, rather than excuses.
I am not saying this as some nice sounding platitude. Literally, when we 
change how we look at things, the things we look at change! Starting to 
ask the right questions for your life and meaning is your way out—the 
circumstances themselves can either empower us or kill us. Make our 
life or destroy it, much of the difference is how we choose to look at it. 
The circumstances themselves seldom change. 
The world doesn’t owe us a living. It doesn’t owe us happiness. Warning: 
You are responsible for your own life and your own happiness. We were 
not promised happiness, just the opportunity to try to find it!
One of my favorite stories is the German shoemaker who sent two of 
his researchers to Africa to explore if there would be market for their 
products. One came back frustrated, saying that there is no market 
because everyone went around barefoot all day. The second man came 
back and told the boss to ramp up production because everyone was 
barefoot and needed shoes!

TRANSFORM
462
Do we find the problem in every opportunity or can we change our 
thinking to see the opportunity in every problem? The way we do that 
is to internally change the question and the meaning we give to things 
that happen to us. This is the basis of true happiness. Many studies have 
shown that people in poor countries are often happier than those in 
richer countries, and this happiness is very internal – happiness comes 
before success – we can’t wait for success to be happy – we have to be 
happy for the success to come!
From the bottom of your heart, you have to have a desire to change and 
transform.
Now at 30, I look back at the darkest point in my life, where I hated 
everything, rejected my family and everything around me, and now 
I see that it was how God broke me down enough to make me look 
beyond my own suffering, and opened up a world where I could be my 
real self. Now I aspire to help people, but instead of doing it out of fear, 
it is my calling. I find the common good and find bridges that connect 
us as humans instead of the things that separate.
Until we give meaning to things, the things don’t have any meaning.
Example? When it rains, a billion people wring their hands, another 
billion don’t care, and another billion thank God.
If we are going to transform, we have to deal with what happens in us, 
not what happens to us. A dear friend had a heart attack, but rather than 
bemoaning his bad luck, he was able to change his eating, his health, 
his relationship with his family and more. Now he celebrates life like 
never before.
Events are going to happen to us in our life, and there will be our response 
(the meaning to us), and then the outcome, and of the three things, the 
only one we can control is our response – our outlook, which influences 
the outcome, which drives us to the top of our life, or the bottom, or 
keeps us where we are. Either way, it’s in our hands! When we take 
100% responsibility for giving our life events the right empowering 
meaning, we start creating a happier life!
Life is very much like a jigsaw puzzle. If you just look at one piece, 
it’s tough to tell what it is, but as you put them together, you start to see 
the beautiful picture. Life is a collection of experiences that with the 

463
CHANGE YOUR OUTLOOK, CHANGE YOUR LIFE! NOW IS YOUR TIME TO LIVE HAPPY!
right meaning – putting the pieces together properly (not forced – that 
creates the wrong picture) – is revealed over time. The little decisions 
we make empower us, in both victory and defeat. Each piece of the 
puzzle, whether good or bad, is part of the picture, and can’t be left out. 
Eventually, the entire picture will be clear, but for now, we have to take 
each piece and see what we can learn and take from it.
Some people are so full of fear, they hope tomorrow never comes. 
Others ask the right questions, and can’t wait for tomorrow to come!
These questions are what reveal the true beauty of life.
I would like to leave you with the empowering question that guides my 
life everyday:
“How can I live my best life today?”
In short, what can I do spiritually, emotionally, financially, physically 
and health-wise to make this my best day ever?
Take the time to answer it and give it conscious energy and direction: 
write your answers down! “Ink ‘em and think ‘em!” This will help 
you create the clear path to where you want your life to go. This will not 
happen overnight, and yes, you will fail sometimes, or, like me, many 
times, but as Thomas Edison said, “you’re not a failure until you give 
up!”
Challenges will come up, you may lose temporary “success” (I did for 
sure!), but learn, move forward, and you will end up growing richer, 
healthier and happier than you would have ever thought possible.

ourselves.” Choose to live happy, my friends!

TAKE A RISK! CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
CHAPTER 52
TAKE A RISK! CHANGE  
YOUR LIFE!
BY ERICA WEST
Cold winds blew, snow piled. Then the rains came. Seven weekends in a 
row. My nose went from blue to running. I desperately wanted to escape 
from Massachusetts and my life. But to where? And how? For a shy, 
introverted school teacher and a consumer electronics salesman with 
two-teenage boys, just scraping by, the options were limited. But there 
are always options and we get to make a choice. As Yogi Berra pointed 
out, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.”
It came in a dream. My husband dreamt about the Grand Canyon, which 
he had never seen. He awoke with the thought, “Let’s visit Phoenix.” 
That July the boys went to 4H camp and we flew to Phoenix for a look-
around. We were awestruck by the bright sunlight, openness, cleanliness 
and July heat. Upon weighing the options we agreed that we would 
rather starve in the heat than in the cold. 
We drove around Phoenix and Scottsdale getting a feel for the desert 
and the lifestyle. So opposite from the gray, closed-in northeast. A hotel 
concierge suggested we visit the tallest fountain in the world just east of 
Scottsdale in appropriately named Fountain Hills. Acting on his advice 
was a pivotal point in our lives. 
The views made us gasp. The scenery was breathtaking. Mountains 
wrapped around this tiny desert community of 3000 people on three sides 

TRANSFORM
468
while the south opened to reservation land and the city of Mesa where a 
carpet of lights sparkled in the night. Watching the Fountain as the water 
cascaded from skyscraper height into the small lake was a Zen moment.
Here is where we wanted to be, this baby desert community. It never 
occurred to us that we couldn’t do it. We didn’t have a clue how, but 
confidently believed that we could succeed. We were in our early 
40’s, healthy, strong and willing to do what we had to. We had already 
survived a devastating time when the only way we could pay for the 
baby’s medicine was to return the empty milk bottles. 
We moved forward on blind faith. We took the risk. It changed our lives. 
There is a difference between gambling and taking a risk. You have no 
control of the outcome when you gamble. You win by chance. But when 
you take a risk the odds are in your favor because you have some control 
of the outcome by the choices that you make. Whether you act on an 
idea or not you are making a choice.
The little equity we would receive from the sale of the house would 
be our nest egg until we got jobs. Back in Massachusetts we started 
the moving process. We put our house up for sale. Like most sellers 
we wanted more than it was worth because we needed it. I didn’t learn 
until afterwards that I had inadvertently chosen a really good real estate 
agent. It wasn’t until later that I discovered that there is a difference. So 
we threw the kids (aged 14 and 16) and the cats into the covered wagon 
and went west. Well, not exactly. Not without some drama.
The universe needed to test us first. On the second day, traveling along 
Interstate 71 east of Columbus, Ohio with my brother who was driving 
out with me, we hit a wall of snow, a whiteout. Blinded. Within seconds, 
36 cars, semis, and a Greyhound bus carrying the elderly bounced off 
of each other – creating a ½ mile of mangled steel, and bone chilling 
sounds. Screams, sirens, helicopters. Snow continued to fall sometimes 
almost obliterating the scene. 
Four hours later in the back of a police car, the promise of a warm motel 
room and my image of the vodka martini I was going to order (as soon 
as we took the ice and broken glass out of our splintered Samsonite 
luggage that we had retrieved from the accordion that had once been my 
car), lessened the trauma I was feeling. 

469
TAKE A RISK! CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
The motel turned out to be an old wooden, somewhat rickety structure 
almost in the middle of nowhere. When I asked the receptionist where 
the bar was I got raised eyebrows. “This is a dry county, mam. You 
cannot buy liquor in this town.” Huh? The heat was almost non-existent 
in the room. I warmed it by stuffing towels around the door and window 
and running the hot shower to create steam to fill the tiny room. 
Okay, so my car got smashed, my luggage and most of its contents 
destroyed; I was freezing; I still needed a way to get to Phoenix and 
adding insult to injury I couldn’t get a glass of wine. My brother and 
I took stock of our situation. This was all small stuff. We had survived 
and without a scratch or bump. Big stuff. 
We started to laugh. Attitude is a choice.
I must have passed the test, because a week later I was in Fountain Hills 
signing a one-year lease for a house on top of a hill on 2 acres with 
360-degree views. I had wandered into a real estate office on the unlikely 
chance of finding an affordable rental in this amazing environment. To 
my surprise and delight, they had one, the only one available! Huh!
The house was an early home in this desert community started in 1973.
The owner built it himself. Its construction was rather dubious so no 
one wanted to buy it. While I waited for the rest of the family to arrive 
5 weeks later, I explored the area. It was so different. Sometimes I felt 
as if I had landed on the moon, other times it appeared to me as the land 
of milk and honey. 
Open houses were everywhere. The Valley of the Sun was beginning 
to grow. As a pastime I drove around Phoenix and Scottsdale looking 
at houses, talking to agents, asking questions. Little pink houses were 
springing up almost overnight. Something intrigued me. By chance an 
agent suggested I get a license to sell real estate. Who me?
Somewhere in the recesses of my mind I heard the words of a principal 
I had worked for, “Selling is teaching. If you are a good teacher you can 
be successful in sales.” I had no idea what I wanted to do in this new 
life. I just knew that I didn’t want to teach school. I chose to follow her 
suggestion. 
My life was transformed. A whole new world opened up to me. 
Opportunity comes in many disguises. But you can recognize it because 

TRANSFORM
470
it always comes hand in hand with choice. In the meantime my husband, 
who had done some networking of his own before we moved, received 
an offer for a job. 
Fountain Hills was, at the time, a small community in a county island. 
It was governed by the county. The land was owned by the master 
developer whose sole purpose at that time was to sell the lots to individual 
buyers to build their future dream home. Low on self-confidence, and 
completely out of my comfort zone, I began my career selling the lots 
for the developer. I learned all I could about the land, its structural and 
architectural possibilities. Blind faith led me to what I was meant to do, 
the place I was meant to be. 
I watched the top producers in our office, listened to what they said and 
how they said it. Whenever real estate trainers came to the Valley. I paid 
to see to them. I traveled to hear them. They taught those who were 
willing to invest in themselves and learn that being a real estate agent 
is a business. They emphasized goals and clear vision, opening our 
eyes to the possibilities. Each trainer had something else to offer. The 
networking and sharing of ideas was priceless. The agents who attended 
these events were tops in the field. Real estate trainers like Tom Ferry, 
Monica Reynolds  and the late Howard Brinton are greatly responsible 
for the professionalism of the real estate industry today.
They taught us how to run a business and what it meant to be a good 
agent. Good real estate agents are full-time career agents who market 
themselves, market your property and know the economics of pricing a 
home so it sells for the highest price the market will bear.
I began listening to self-development gurus. Brian Tracy, Jim Rohn and 
Tony Robbins became my companions. I listened everywhere. Goal-
setting was not in the curriculum when I went to school. I started setting 
goals and writing them down, following my mentor’s instructions.
My third year as an agent I was recognized as the top producer in the 
office. Just at that time the savings and loan debacle started and my 
husband lost his job. Banks were closing and homes were going into 
foreclosure. Chicken Little was yelling the sky is falling. Depression 
fell. Doom and gloom paralyzed everyone.

TAKE A RISK! CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
We had a choice; we could stay in the dismal atmosphere and eventually 
get sucked into it or we could find a way out. 
By chance, an advertisement in an industry magazine caught my eye. 
A new real estate company with a different business model was selling 
franchises. It was targeted to top producing agents who wouldn’t let 
themselves be influenced by outside circumstances that they couldn’t 
control. 
We saw an opportunity to grow and to be in business for ourselves. We 
made the choice to risk it and bought a franchise. Of course we were 
now seriously in debt. The country was in a full-blown recession and 
our credit cards were maxed out. But we moved ahead with blind faith 
and the confidence we had gained from success.
In those moments when we felt fear we remembered Brian Tracy’s 
advice. “Think about the worst thing that can happen. If you are prepared 
to deal with it, take the risk.” Our teachers had taught us well. 
Lessons from history show us that life is cyclical. But I see the cycle 
more like a Ferris wheel, forever turning. You get on and it starts to 
move upward, swinging with the rhythm of the wind, taking you up and 
then down as it rotates. Sometimes it even gets stuck in a spot and you 
find yourself dangling. It is your attitude and your choices that can carry 
you back up. 
 So after 10 years of success beyond our wildest dreams, we made a 
poor choice by selling our franchise to the wrong person. My husband 
and I found ourselves at the bottom of the wheel once more. It was a 
painful time. The old self-development tapes came out of the closet, 
the teachers reminding us to have a “can do” attitude. We took another 
chance and started over again opening a new independent real estate 
agency under my name. We took the ride back up to the top.
If you are one of the thousands of people who have a fear of heights you 
stay low, overcome by the fear that you will fall. Well, so what if you 
fall? Get up! The bumps and the bruises are small stuff. You are alive. 
That’s big stuff. You can reach heights you never dreamed of if you take 
a risk. Hidden behind the veil of risk lies opportunity. Remember risk 
involves choice, but the odds are in your favor when you make these 7 
choices: 

TRANSFORM
472
1. Let go of fear. 
2. Have an attitude of faith and belief in yourself.
3. Know the difference between the big stuff and the small stuff. 
4. Set goals and write them down.
5. Take action. Stay in action.
6. Invest in yourself by investing in your education. Learn all you 
can in your chosen field. Become an expert.
7. Listen to self-development mentors’ CDs, read their books and do 
the exercises. They will help you through #1 and #2
Be brave. Enjoy the ride.

BUILDING BLACK BELT CHILDREN
CHAPTER 53
BUILDING BLACK  
BELT CHILDREN
BY HILARY J. SANDOVAL III
“Its easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.” 
~ Frederick Douglass
In the martial arts the symbol of success, excellence, and achievement 
is the black belt. Please know that this chapter is not about martial arts 
for your children, its about using the character building skills that are 
inherent in the martial arts to help your child develop the skills to become 
a black belt in life. I have been in the martial arts business for over 30 
years, however when I am asked what I do for a living my answer is 
that I help children build the foundation necessary for achievement and 
success. 
Before I share some of the motivational teaching strategies that are used 
in the martial arts, I would like to share my own personal story how the 
positive thinking martial arts develops changed my life. Martial arts 
saved my life. No, I didn’t find myself in the middle of a life-threatening 
self-defense situation requiring me to fight for my very existence. 
Instead, it was the leadership skills, the character values I learned, 
the confidence I gained, and the sense of self-worth I developed as a 
student that saved me from a path of certain self-destruction. It was the 
challenge to both my mind and body that transformed me from a life of 
potential misery and regret to an entrepreneur dedicated and passionate 
about helping children reach their full potential in life.

My spiral of descent began with the death of my father when I was a 
15-year-old teenager. My father, put quite simply, was my hero. I knew 
he couldn’t leap tall buildings in a single bound, however, I thought he 
had the powers necessary to defeat brain cancer. June 11th, 1973 was 
the day I realized that my father was mortal, the same as the rest of us. 
Three days later, only hours before my father was to be laid to rest my 
mother received a call from the doctor informing her that I had a brain 
tumor as well.
During my father’s courageous and valiant fight for his life, I was losing 
weight, suffering terribly from headaches, and had no energy at all. The 
doctors assumed that I was merely suffering from the stress of witnessing 
my father’s health deteriorate daily. Following my diagnosis, I was in 
and out of hospitals for the better part of a year. 
After months of unsuccessful radiation treatment (it is a wonder I don’t 
glow in the dark) brain surgery was required. I’m not writing about 
the non-invasive surgery of today where laser beams are used through 
the nose or mouth; I’m speaking about old fashion saw your skull in 
half, pulling your skin off your skull, and drilling-holes-in-your-head 
surgery. (I hope you’re not squeamish.) The scar that runs from ear to 
ear across the top of my head serves as a reminder of this dark period 
of my life.
I write dark period, because at the time I grew very bitter and resentful. 
Bitter about the loss of my father and resentful about my health. 
Depression ruled my life, so much so that I was apathetic about the 
situation, not caring whether I survived the surgery or not. I watched 
my father suffer greatly from two painful unsuccessful brain surgeries 
himself. In my young and still immature mind, I had somehow formulated 
the idea that if the surgeries were unsuccessful for my father why would 
it work for me? Thankfully the surgery was successful. However, rather 
than being grateful, I continued to cling on to my anger, resentment, and 
bitterness.
My poor attitude led me to some very self-destructive behavior. I 
regularly challenged my mother’s authority. Even after missing an entire 
year of school due to my health, I was regularly truant not thinking 
about how my actions would affect my future. I was making the wrong 
kind of friends, drinking heavily and was definitely heading down a 

477
BUILDING BLACK BELT CHILDREN
path of self-destruction. At the young age of 16 I felt lost, hopeless, and 
completely empty inside.
Several months earlier my doctor had suggested martial arts as a means 
to get back in physical shape. The doctor informed me that the martial 
arts are based on individual achievement. He said I would start to feel 
better about myself, regain my physical strength and develop self-
discipline. I’m embarrassed to admit that my reasons for enrolling in 
the martial arts were far less noble. Quite frankly, I wanted to take out 
my pain, anger, and frustration on anyone who dared crossed me. This 
is the opposite of what martial arts is about.
I quickly discovered that martial arts are not about hurting others. It’s 
about developing yourself. It’s about becoming the best you can be. In 
time, my depression was replaced with hope. My hope grew to passion. 
My emptiness was filled with a burning desire to earn my black belt and 
becoming a professional kickboxing promoter.
I achieved my goal of becoming a professional kickboxing promoter at 
the age of 18, becoming the youngest promoter in the United States to 
promote a professional world championship at the age of twenty-one. 
I also promoted the very first nationally-televised kickboxing match in 
the state of Texas. During my time as a promoter I had the good fortune 
to work with 23 world champions, including legendary film star Chuck 
Norris. After retiring from promoting I soon opened my academy.
The reason I share this story is because I truly believe if it weren’t for 
the positive mental aspects of the martial arts – I wouldn’t be here today. 
It was those empowering principles that I learned that gave my life 
direction and hope.
So how does the above story relate to helping your child build the 
confidence, discipline, and self-esteem to live a happy, productive, and 
successful life? … Because the qualities and character traits it takes to 
earn a black belt or become a champion are the very same life-skills it 
takes to lead a happy, productive, and successful life.
In our martial arts academies we have discovered that there are four key 
areas that are needed to build black belts:
1.	A ‘Yes I Can’ Attitude
2.	Black Belt Confidence

TRANSFORM
478
3.	Black Belt Challenges
4.	Black Belt Self-Esteem
A ‘YES I CAN’ ATTITUDE
Our school motto is Black Belt ‘Yes I Can.’ Every time students bow in 
our academy, they say ‘Yes I Can.’ Over my 40 plus years of experience 
in the martial arts I have learned that the most important key to earning 
a black belt is believing you can earn a black belt.
The greatest barrier for a child to earn his black belt is not a lack of 
self-discipline or desire. In our years of experience we have discovered 
the greatest reason some students fall short of earning their black belts 
is the lack of belief in their abilities. Without self-belief, it is nearly 
impossible for your child to reach his dreams and goals.
To illustrate the power of belief and demonstrate the limitations of fear 
and doubt, I’ll use our white belt test as an example. For students to pass 
their white belt examination they must break a wooden pine board with 
their bare hands.
It’s easy to explain the science and physics that cause a board to break 
from a karate blow. The velocity of the strike, plus the force, backed by 
mass will cause the board to break. However there is a very important 
mental aspect as well. For the board to break the student must fully 
commit his technique. Often times children fear they will hurt their 
hands when they hit the board and as a consequence they tentatively 
hit the board not fully extending their technique. As a result they hit at 
the board, rather than punching through the board. Fear prevented them 
from giving their best effort. Doubt prevented them from success.
Ironically, it hurts more when the board doesn’t break than when a 
student successfully breaks a board. In most cases it was not improper 
technique that caused the student to fail to succeed, it was their own fear 
that held them back.
This is the perfect metaphor for life. As children, and later as adults, we 
hold ourselves back from what we are truly capable of because of our 
fears and doubts. Ask yourself if you have ever hit at the board, rather 
than punching through the board during a challenge or while striving for 
a worthwhile goal. Early on in your child’s life, start programming them 

479
BUILDING BLACK BELT CHILDREN
with a ‘Yes I Can’ attitude. Praise and recognize their efforts. Show your 
belief in them. Explain to them how important having a ‘Yes I Can’ 
attitude is.
BLACK BELT CONFIDENCE 
Developing a ‘Yes I Can’ attitude and learning to control their fears and 
doubts is the first step to your children developing black belt confidence. 
People who have a healthy level of self-esteem and confidence are 
strong, secure and high achievers. Their self-confidence is evident in all 
areas of their lives; their education, career and personal relationships. 
During my time as a kickboxing promoter, I can say each of the world 
champions I had the good fortune to work with were all supremely 
confident. Often times the only difference between a contender and a 
champion was confidence. 
Former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was 
perhaps the most famous athlete of all time. His fame transcended the 
sport of boxing. Arguably he is regarded as the best heavyweight boxer 
of all time. He was not only a master inside the boxing ring, he was 
a master of positive self-talk. He programmed his mind for success 
by repeating over-and-over again, “ I’m the greatest!” in fact when 
people speak of him today many refer to him as simply the greatest. 
How successful would he have been, how memorable would his career 
have been if he merely, stated, “ I’m pretty good.” He was so bold and 
confident that early in his career he would accurately predict what round 
he would win in. 
Of course I’m not suggesting that your child should walk down the 
hallways at school boasting “I’m the greatest.” What I am suggesting is 
that you start programming your child’s mind with a ‘Yes I Can’ attitude 
early and often.
The next step to building black belt confidence is to provide your child 
with meaningful goals. This is the key to how martial arts training help 
children become high achievers in life. Goals give our lives direction, 
focus, and meaning. In most martial arts academies the main goal is 
to earn a black belt. To earn a black belt in most styles of the martial 
arts takes three to four years. That is a long time for a child and most 
adults as well. What martial arts has done so well is to break down long-
term goals like earning a black belt into smaller, more tangible, and 

TRANSFORM
480
achievable goals with the different colored belts that students wear on 
their uniforms.
Each time a child earns a new belt it is a personal victory for the student. 
The awarding of a new belt fosters a feeling of achievement, and a 
sense of accomplishment. This sense of achievement builds the child’s 
confidence and self-worth. With each belt a child earns, the feeling of 
confidence and self-esteem grow.
Whatever goal you and your child decide on, it is vitally important to 
remember to break down the goal into challenging yet achievable steps. 
In the sports of kickboxing and boxing the same process is used. When 
a promoter discovers a prospect that he believes has the potential to 
become a champion, he will carefully match his prospect with suitable 
opponents – opponents who will challenge his prospect and yet at 
the same time, he will have complete confidence that his protégé will 
prevail.
It is extremely important that the prospect experiences a series of 
victories before moving on to more challenging competition. He must 
learn how to win and internalize each victory to create a feeling of 
confidence and esteem. The confidence the prospect earns will increase 
his belief in himself. The greater his self-belief is, the greater his skills 
will be. The higher skill level in turn creates even greater confidence, 
building a positive cycle of increased skill level and self-belief.
This beginning matchmaking process is extremely important to the 
ultimate success or failure of a potential champion. Over-matching a 
prospect too soon in his career can literally ruin a fighter. Conversely, 
not providing a prospect with enough challenge will leave the prospect 
ill-prepared for a big opportunity.
 It is the very same process for children. If your child is currently 
struggling to pass a particular class in school do not expect him or her 
to earn an A+ on the next grading cycle. Instead break down the goal of 
an A+ in to achievable steps. If your child is a C- student, set a goal for 
a B- for the next report card. Should your child achieve that goal then 
raise the bar a little higher. With each achievement or goal your child 
accomplishes, always provide your child with a new more challenging 
goal.

481
BUILDING BLACK BELT CHILDREN
BLACK BELT CHALLENGES
The reason goals are so vitally important for your child to become a 
black belt in life is because they provide challenges for your child. 
Challenges makes us grow, motivate us to learn, develop perseverance, 
and self-discipline. Challenges will stretch your children and provide 
them with the courage to leave their comfort zones. Challenges create 
new experiences, new opportunities, and provide your child with a sense 
of confidence for overcoming some of their fears.
Conversely, the unchallenged child will not learn how to handle the 
difficulties that are an inescapable part of life. Children who are not 
challenged will grow bored, often seeking diversion in less than healthy 
ways. Overeating, too much television, and perhaps later succumb to 
the lure of drugs.
 Again the best way for you to challenge your child is to find something 
she enjoys and help her set meaningful goals within that activity.
BLACK BELT SELF-ESTEEM
Thus far we have discussed developing a ‘Yes I Can’ attitude in your 
child, building black belt confidence, and providing your child with black 
belt challenges. If all three of the aforementioned steps are successfully 
implemented your child will have a healthy self-esteem. Self-esteem 
is how we value ourselves. It is how we feel about ourselves. If your 
child has a positive ‘Yes I Can’ attitude, confidence and belief in his/her 
abilities and is provided with a challenge that will stretch her limits and 
help her grow as a person, self-esteem is a natural by-product.
Building all of these qualities in your child will play big dividends for 
the health and welfare of your child. A child with a ‘Yes I Can’ attitude, 
unstoppable confidence, who is unafraid of challenge, and who has self-
worth and self-esteem, will indeed become a black belt in life.

THE RAY OF CREATION 
CHAPTER 54
THE RAY OF CREATION 
BY HERB G. BENNETT 
The universe, Life and Man are interactive dynamic processes with 
powerful correspondences of all consciousness that’s above and below. 
There is a ray of light connecting us to all of creation. Our inspirations, 
thoughts, ideas are ‘above’ and are transformed into reality ‘below’. We 
are the ‘mediators’, travelling along ‘THE RAY OF CREATION’ using 
our imagination, creativity and resources creating life support systems 
to satisfy our physical, mental and spiritual needs. We also use this ray 
to elevate our consciousness to tap into the sources of inspiration and 
stimuli that transform into sense data, thoughts, concepts and ideas to 
design our lives and worlds. 
The human mind reflects the universal Mind and connects to the ALL 
of ALL. Natural creative principles reveal structural logic, myths 
and mysteries to us creating value systems enabling us to synthesize 
knowledge within thought form frameworks and paradigms that are 
constantly changing. Physical expressions use symmetry principles 
that obey natural laws. The fundamental law is the Law of Three (3). 
Every thought, idea, expression or being is a corresponding vibration 
with flavors defining its form. Mind, Body and Spirit form a ‘triad’ of 
‘flavors’ composed of subtle (above) and gross (below) expressions that 
are synthesized using the laws and symmetry principles that distribute 
flavors, qualities and gauges of matter into reality. 

TRANSFORM
484
Abstraction is essential to ‘transformative thinking’ for clarity and 
true understanding. Using concepts like ‘suchness’ and ‘muchness’ 
instead of names help creative thoughts, feelings and emotions flow. 
Understanding correspondences with Body, Mind and Spirit; ‘above 
and below’ transforms electrical stimuli into sense data mentally. 
‘Mentalism’ is being true to form. All things are mental. The ‘ray of 
creation’ leads to pure principles. Pure extension is Space. Pure duration 
is Time and pure thought is Spirit. All consciousness and its expressions 
of reality are governed by ‘three principles’ – physiology, psychology 
and spirituality. The word ‘spirituality’ used here means creative spirit or 
work-energy. The finest fuel of all we know is thought. All expressions 
of nature are made of three basic elements. The universal codes are 
physiology, psychology and spirituality. These are the instructions that 
created us with our qualitative and quantitative, gauges, behaviors and 
strength. They work with every Body, Mind and Spirit vibrational level 
we think of as reality. This is creation’s code. We use it to create our 
worlds.
Space, time and energy correlate with all qualitative (suchness) definitions 
and quantitative (muchness) descriptions of natural phenomena and 
“thought forms.” Stimuli are transformed into ideas based on natural 
phenomena encoding functions and behaviors. They are reduced to 
concepts that follow the fundamental Law of Three (3) becoming all 
regenerative symmetry principles for physical, psychological and 
spiritual expressions. Principles are laws or facts of nature encoded into 
thoughts, artificial devices and creative expressions adhering to discrete 
symmetrical rules with unique identities.
This symmetry is dynamic. It is not the mirror reflections we know, but 
“the behaviors of parts that make things work holistically.” Geometric 
expressions have unique identities and symmetries. When rules and 
behaviors are understood, identities can be transformed. In addition 
to standard symmetry, with enantiomorphism or handedness, there are 
Rotational, Glide, Polygonal and Spiral symmetries. This Triad applies 
to periodicities of expressions in nature as light, orientation, matter, 
color and numbers. When the three fundamental elements are reduced 
and distributed they form expanded expressions of flavors and ‘phyla’ 
of natural and artificial phenomena. When symmetries and triads are 
aligned, creativity is harmonized and consciousness is transformed into 
reality. We see the Law of Three (3) as being fundamental to artificial 

485
THE RAY OF CREATION 
and natural processes. Are there other number laws working in nature? 
Could living in a three dimensional reality be one reason? Does this 
relate to the three developmental stages of the human brain? 
Transformations are created and experienced by tapping into the sub, the 
tangible and super consciousness. Our tangible consciousness is enriched 
when the sub (below) and super (above) dimensions support our normal 
‘RAM’ minds. Attributes of the Body, Mind, Spirit (BMS) or Triad, 
are tuned to higher thoughts and correspondences. We use threefold 
symmetries to transform ourselves intuitively and unknowingly. We 
have mastered the materialistic expressions, leaving the psychological 
and spiritual components less developed. When we internalize this 
knowledge our actions become clear and lives are transformed. We stop 
rolling dies to begin living lives in total harmony. 
What are the factors involved in developing our psychological, 
spiritual or electrical lives? Yes my friends, life is electric and magnetic 
like the cosmos with the ‘ALL of consciousness’ we mirror. Rene 
Descartes’ definition of ‘Man’; the ‘plumbing model of circulation’ is 
replaced by Man; the complex bio, magnetic, electrical, plasmic being. 
Transformation is about becoming our highest and best self-image, 
knowing who we are to develop a ‘toolbox’ to align with our true self. 
Every era has a very distinct expression, identity and flavor. We have the 
opportunity, the technologies and intelligence to identify, question and 
research the relevant principles to invent new toolboxes. The cyclical 
potential of transformations between periods is led by paradigm shifts. 
Carpe diem is the order.
Technology, philosophy, and culture (Body, Mind and Spirit) evolve with 
enduring principles in tow. Recognizing that we are part of ‘movements’ 
and resulting ‘consciousness shifts’ is “The essence of Transformations.” 
Transformative thinking, or ‘Structural Philosophy’, is the first step 
in understanding how to create ‘thought forms.’ The highest form of 
energy we know is thought. Ideas, new form vocabularies, technologies 
and inventions tell the stories of mankind. The shift is already here. Are 
we ready to embrace it to ‘reinvent’ ourselves? What tools do we have 
and what knowledge do we need? 
Creative expressions emerge from the internal dialog using visual and 
mathematical processes. It starts by transforming electrical impulses 

TRANSFORM
486
and brain stimuli into sense data for thought form re-cognition. When 
we speak to ourselves we think. In speaking to others we communicate. 
What are thoughts? Do they make us who we are or vice versa? What 
values do we incorporate into our thought processes and into peoples’ 
lives? What is the role of culture and aesthetics in this process? How do 
we define them? Do they add any value?
Culture is the blend of the artificial with the natural. ‘Man’ uses natural 
materials to make beautiful things. Another popular version describes 
it as ‘art forms’ – dance, music, art and food. The Law of Three defines 
culture as harmonizing body, mind and spirit, aligned with the ‘Ray of 
Creation’ in the Space, Time, and Energy continuum. The first definition 
of culture refers to the past. It is stored subconscious experiences in 
space, time, energy as sense data and images for recall. The present 
popular view reflects our prevalent contemporary attitudes. The third is 
the future super consciousness set to inform new paradigms. These are 
big picture views of the world with newly transformed ideas that rely on 
proven and sustainable principles. They change our thought processes, 
impact our language and transform our lives. Where does transforming 
this esoteric knowledge into practical strategies for solutions lead?
Languages change over time to correspond with evolving thought forms, 
rituals and rhythms we create. Science and other disciplines constantly 
evolve. It is nature’s way of revealing new sources of ‘suchness and 
muchness’ we can revisit. The east-west cultural divide has mental 
boundaries, dichotomies, myths and mysteries well entrenched and 
intact. Oriental systems of thought are often strange and difficult to 
accept by western views (paradigms). Western ideas are sometimes not 
readily accepted by oriental cultures. These schisms lead to wars and 
other socio-political and religious differences with unresolved conflicts. 
How can there be true ‘globalism’ if we cannot find common ground in 
philosophical and cultural traditions in the present East-West schism? 
‘Meditation’ and ‘visualization’ are two major contributions to the west 
that correlate with our endocrine system. The endocrine system, the 
Brain and the central nervous system is western medicine’s triad. Eastern 
frameworks start much earlier with the understanding of the Body, Mind, 
and Spirit continuum built upon meditation and visualization practices. 
Western medical science is a space-time framework without ‘spirit’. It 
focuses on physiology, chemistry, biology and other synthetic disciplines. 

487
THE RAY OF CREATION 
The law of polarity governs these orientations we do not comprehend. 
This knowledge helps transform concepts into practical solutions from a 
deeper understanding of the ‘mechanics of consciousness’, synthesizing 
and harmonizing new creative methodologies. Be the potter with ideas 
or yourself on the wheel of life. The material, the mental and creative 
processes interact with all the creative forces you are connected to, 
expressing who you are and what you make. 
Start by looking at earlier stages of your life to find what you were 
curious about and got the most joy doing. Early first impressions become 
passions with life transforming creative skills and opportunities. I used 
to shape the tops of large milk tins into plates. Now I design ceramic 
dinnerware. I wanted to discover nature’s secrets for making forms. I 
invent and patent useful vocabularies of three-dimensional forms. I love 
cutting and folding forms with paperboard. There is a Zen quality to 
it. Cutting and folding is free, fluid and graceful. I invent curved three 
dimensional forms while conducting geometric experiments in this 
relatively new ‘Non Euclidean paradigm.’ From a simple mindless task, 
I distill knowledge through an extremely complex process. Dancing 
‘thought-forms’ in my head are manifested. Retrace your steps, find your 
joy and make it your theme. Explore and consume everything about it. 
Study, read, draw and model as many forms as possible. Drawing is a 
vital spatial learning skill. Growing expands your creative and critical 
thinking abilities. We forget these earlier clues and lessons as adults 
and let the world define our needs. Then there is crisis, loss or pain to 
motivate us to find our joy again. Early play, focus, observation and 
formalizing earlier passions are great experiences. I still am amazed 
about what causes animals to be up and running with their herds, 
minutes after they are born, while humans take years to complete their 
brain wiring, if they ever do at all.
Connect to your higher self, that version of what you want to be, to do 
and say to the world. Gain deeper levels of understanding of natural 
principles and laws by being curious again. Observe and reconnect with 
what interests you the most. Begin to focus your physical, mental and 
creative spirit or energy and begin to align with the creative intelligences 
we are all connected to. 
You have the ability to access freely and abundantly the knowledge you 
want. Transform metaphysical strategies and bring real ideas into the 

TRANSFORM

world whether they are from your past or are new. Make this creative 
process your value system generator for your original ideas. Start with 
a vivid mental picture of the life you ‘want’ with all the things, positive 
feelings and power you want created by your ideas. Let the joy of that 
intention be your inspiration. Recognize this as mentalism in action; the 
dream is being realized with focused imagination and clarity of thought. 
Meditate (think) and visualize (imagine) clearly and precisely. Create 
(with energy) the reality you want and will to manifest with passion 
and ease of repetition. Master your focus and focus your mastery to 
perfection. Be open to knowledge without cultural bias or judgment. 
Develop your hand-mind–heart coordination to enhance your sensitivity 
and integrity. Apply the ‘Body, Mind, and Spirit Triad’ to phenomena 
you see clearly. Make the Law of Three (3) work for you. Study elements 
and forces of nature with your new “nanoscope.” Let these principles 
be the cure for fear-based ‘need’ thinking. Become compassionate with 
open heart-thinking. Invite positive thoughts into your work life through 
your life’s work. Explore new values, experiences, intuitions and 
insights by thinking abstractly. Rethink quality and not quantity (body), 
change behavior (mind) to harmonize with principles. Connect to your 
higher creative spirit through your creative language to communicate 
on the physical, psychological and creative levels through your heart 
thinking. Be in control of your creative destiny and freedom, live fully 
and be happy.

—IT’S SAFER AND EASIER 
THAN YOU THINK
BY DONALD HENIG
Only those who will risk going too far can  
possibly find out how far one can go. 
~ T.S. Elliot
In this chapter, you will learn how to make a list of 10 – 20 new 
businesses you can start immediately! And I will show you that it is 
smarter and safer to start a business than to look for a job, especially 
for the millennial generation. I will show you the way to become the 
boss and enjoy the luxuries that come with it, including cars, boats, and 
houses as well as, helping many others due to your good fortune and 
hard work. The opportunities in front of you are life-changing for you 
and for those around you. Trust me; I’ve done it many times.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, 
 you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion

I LEFT MILLIONS ON THE TABLE WHILE I WAS  
SEARCHING FOR A JOB/CAREER
While in college, I was asked to create a product and then create a 
marketing plan for that product. This was part of an advanced marketing 
class. At the time in 1980, coffee was sold in Styrofoam cups and the 
lids were a solid, thin plastic. The product I created was a coffee cup 
lid with perforated edges, which enabled the consumer to easily and 
quickly tear off a portion of the lid, so you could drink the hot coffee 
and keep it hot. At the time, my lid was not available, so people tore at 
one corner and then another and then ripped it back. 
Sometimes it came off and sometimes you had a lid that would cut 
your lip. My invention or product was so ingenious that within 2 years 
everyone used it. The only problem was that I didn’t make any money 
from this brilliant idea. Someone else patented the idea after me and 
made a fortune! Good for them, they had the nerve and the open mind 
to take a shot and create their own job. I was still of the mindset that 
I needed a job and to work toward retirement – bad thinking. Let me 
show you the reasons that you should strongly consider creating your 
own job as opposed to looking for one and I’ll show you how to do it. I 
recognize that being an entrepreneur may scare you, but if you take the 
time to read this with an open mind, maybe a few points will resonate 
enough for you to look deeper. And then… success!
Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.

Everyone benefits when you create a new business, product or service. 
People get hired by you and they buy houses, cars, carpeting, food... 
And you buy bigger houses, nicer cars, and you have the ability to help 
many people in any way you choose. Your creation will trigger other 
ideas and new businesses for you and others to start and cause more 
people to be hired and benefit. For example, Apple has roughly 47,000 
employees in the USA, but accounts for roughly 514,000 jobs in the 

493
STOP LOOKING FOR A JOB… CREATE ONE!!!!—IT’S SAFER AND EASIER THAN YOU THINK
USA and over 700,000 overseas supporting Apple (app developers, for 
example) (according to NYT 3/4/12)! Everyone who creates a business 
helps many more people than they hire. The ripples are like a pebble 
thrown into a lake, it goes way beyond the first ring the eye can see. So 
Michelangelo, create and enjoy the riches!!
EMPLOYER OR EMPLOYEE – YOUR CHOICE
•	 Did you know that only 25% of employees with paid time off took 
all of their vacation days in 2013? (according to Glassdoor.com’s 
data of a Harris poll). And, according to the same survey, 22% of 
employees don’t receive any paid time off at all! Is this the life you 
want? 
•	 80% of Americans are stressed out by at least one thing at 
work (Nielson Research for Everest College). Workloads have 
increased, yet pay has not kept pace. Low pay, long commutes and 
unreasonable workloads are the main causes of stress. This is now 
the definition of a job, and most people want one! This is what 
most people are looking for (a job).
•	 Pew Research reported that bosses are more likely to be satisfied 
with their financial situation. And they also state that bosses are 
more satisfied with both their home life and their job too! If your 
boss is happier, why not be the boss? After all, aren’t we all doing 
this to be happy????
•	 And finally, Economist Barry Bosworth at the Brookings Institution 
crunched the numbers and found that the richer you are, the longer 
you’ll live. And it’s a gap that is widening, particularly among 
women! Money may not buy happiness, but it sure can give you a 
few extra years to find happiness.
So more time off, more money, more satisfaction with work and 
homelife, and live a longer life. Be the boss!
BUT I HAVE FEARS!!!
No Money? No Experience?? No Knowledge???

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.  
The second best time is now.  
~ Chinese Proverb
If you start a little stupid or less informed, you will have less fear and 
the obstacles that you will definitely face won’t scare you into quitting 
too soon. Let me provide a few personal examples.
I knew nothing about…
•	 The entertainment industry when I started the predecessor to 
Corner Store Entertainment, which produced Rock of Ages, the 
musical, the 37th longest running show on Broadway – ever! 
•	 Residential mortgages when I started my first mortgage company 
and sold it ten years later.
•	 Franchising when I created a mortgage broker franchise and built 
it to 760 units nationwide and sold it.
•	 Owning an ice cream truck when I bought one at 19 years old and 
made more money than at any time before.
•	 The publishing industry, but started a soccer publication that 
became the official newspaper for New York State Junior Soccer 
with circulation of over 160,000 papers per month.
•	 I have many more examples – just start stupid.
•	 Oh, and I was a solid ‘C’ student in High School with a good 
personality, great passion and a lack of fear. The younger you are, 
the less you have to lose. Make it happen and enjoy the luxuries 
in life!
Fear is often the #1 reason people don’t create new businesses. If you 
knew all the potential pitfalls prior to starting a business, you probably 
would never start one. Nobody would, not even a young Steve Jobs. 
There is a great principle called the Corridor Principle that basically 
states that you cannot possibly see all the doors that will be open to you 
until you begin to walk down the corridor. It applies to starting a new 
business perfectly. You cannot possibly see the answers to the obstacles 
that will absolutely arise after you open your business, until you take 
the plunge. 
There are no real obstacles, just fears to overcome!

495
STOP LOOKING FOR A JOB… CREATE ONE!!!!—IT’S SAFER AND EASIER THAN YOU THINK
“BUT I AM NOT OLD OR SMART ENOUGH?” 
Everyone else in this industry is older and smarter and more experienced. 
In reality, the older person is looking at you and your energy and 
contacts and knowledge of technology and they are scared of you! Use 
your advanced skills and immediately begin networking with like-
minded people and grow together. In almost no time you will gain the 
knowledge and experience and yet still have more energy and contacts, 
with the power of technology in your pocket. Stand back world!!!! I 
have an idea!
Bottom line, you have nothing to fear and nobody to fear. You are just 
as good or better. And if they could learn it, so can you - right? Come 
on, face the facts – you are going to kick butt! I am just saying to do it 
now and don’t delay.
The greatest mistake a man can make is being afraid to make one.  
~ Elbert Hubbard
Here’s How To Start YOUR Business Today!!!!
It always seems impossible until it’s done.  
~ Nelson Mandela
Find your idea. The simplest thing to do is to form a team with some like-
minded friends (commonly referred to as a mastermind group). It must 
be with people you like and really, really trust. Keep the group small. 
The immediate goal is to list 100 ideas for a new business. There are no 
bad ideas (seriously, every idea gets logged for further discussion). If 
an idea is bad or stupid, then realize that if you think it can’t be done, 
then everyone else will have the same thought, but if you CAN figure it 
out, then you have gold! The craziest ideas are normally the best. Okay, 
once you list all 100 ideas (maybe you get to 30 and stop, but I strongly 
suggest going to 100 – make it fun), then it is time to begin narrowing 
the list. Get to the top 20, then the top 10 and 5 and finally the best 3. 
When you get to the top 3-5, put more work into researching those ideas 
before making a final decision. The final decision may surprise you – it 
almost always does. A great way to research your idea and shorten the 
learning curve is to look at a franchise in that field/industry and learn 
their tactics and copy what makes sense and seems to work. If they don’t 
have a patent on the process, it is open to all.

TRANSFORM
496
•	 Test market your top 2-3 great ideas and see which one resonates 
with your target market and with you. You have to love it and feel 
excited, otherwise do something else. If you’re not excited, it’s a 
job….. ugh!
Every great business begins as an idea or a thought and then it becomes 
a dream. That’s when it cannot be stopped. Dreams are more powerful 
than anything. When you can’t sleep, go for it. Don’t let anything stop 
you. You are going to win!
10 TRIGGERS TO YOUR BIG IDEA
Discontent is the first necessity of progress.  
~ Thomas Edison
Here are some very simple new business ideas that might trigger 
something within you or you may want to start one of these – be my 
guest and enjoy. Just let me know how it goes and know that you owe 
me nothing but a brief thank you and update. I love helping people 
succeed!!!
•	 What are you good at???? Find something that involves the things 
you are good at doing and enjoy. Then figure out a business related 
to that. Pretty simple.
-- Make a list of 20 experiences that you were passionate about as 
a starting point.
•	 If you’re an athlete, train younger kids for money. In today’s 
competitive world of children playing a single sport, they almost 
all need a trainer. You can help and charge good money for this 
service. Parents will pay! Also, once you get good at this, you 
might form classes to train more kids at one time (more money for 
you). Then you might hire other athletes your age and skill level 
and form a camp (big money). Go for it. Start today and see what 
happens.
•	 If you excel in a subject, tutor others. If you are good at math and 
you are in High School, can’t you help a 7th, 8th or 9th grader in their 
lower level math? Think about it, their parents might pay $50 - 
$150 per hour for a professional, but you can help them for $25 per 
hour and make some money for yourself.

497
STOP LOOKING FOR A JOB… CREATE ONE!!!!—IT’S SAFER AND EASIER THAN YOU THINK
•	 Mowing lawns sounds simple, yet most services do a terrible job! 
Go through a neighborhood and do a survey house to house. Ask 
what they like and don’t like about their landscaper, and how much 
they pay (create a form and write their responses). Then return with 
a plan: better services for slightly less money. Take the account and 
then get the next one and the next. Then hire the people to do the 
work and you perform the sales and the quality control functions. 
Be better than the others and you can eventually charge even more 
than them. This is a real business waiting for someone with energy, 
guts and a dream. 
•	 Blog writing: yes, most businesses need a blog and they don’t 
have the time. Charge $50 for a 150-word blog. Learn a bit about 
the company and write one per week. Then do it for many small 
companies and you have a business! 
•	 Pick up dog crap door to door. That’s right, dog crap! I hope you’re 
not too proud to make money! Do something others don’t want to 
do and you will have a business for life because the barrier to entry 
is in their mind. You can’t lose!
-- @ $25 per house 2x per week, if you get 10 in a small 
neighborhood, you just built a business earning $500 p/w 
working less than 2 hours! If you get 20 in a neighborhood, then 
you just quickly built a business earning $52,000 per year. And 
that’s only 20 houses. That’s not even an effort yet. Go to work 
and make a million! Why not??
•	 Mobile applications
-- Hire a developer on e-lance.com and run with your idea.
•	 Offer your services on taskrabbit.com.
•	 If you’re an artist, submit designs on 99designs.com.
•	 Clean pools: Get a job cleaning pools and learn the trade. Learn 
how to open and close pools. Save your money and start your 
business the next year. Create a niche and get 30 accounts to start. 
In time, you will be able to sell this business and retire.
•	 And # 11… Teach older people how to use the computer better.
But I don’t have enough money! Here are just a few ideas that may help:

TRANSFORM
498
•	 Try preselling your services for 2 years for payment in advance. Do 
that with 10 to 20 clients and you may have just bridged the gap.  
•	 Take 20% of your business and sell it to family and friends. They 
believe in you, so let them invest in you. This is ‘angel’ funding.
•	 Give deep discounts for quick payment to help with early cash flow.
•	 Use crowd funding sites – they really work.
•	 Partner with an older person: Your idea and passion and their cash 
can make a beautiful partnership.
There are so many more, but space is limited. The point is that you need 
to take control of your life and create a job, not work for someone else. 
It’s your turn to earn the money and enjoy your work life, home life and 
live longer. Why not you? Good luck! And remember, you are worth 
more than $15 per hour! Make it happen!!

About Donald
Don Henig used his thirst for knowledge, his passion to be 
the best, and his entrepreneurial spirit to propel his career 
achievements to new heights multiple times. Don began his 
entrepreneurial career as a successful financial planner, which 
led to starting his own mortgage banking firm, which ultimately 
grew to one of the largest in New York State in just a few years. Don was called to 
testify before both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate on behalf of 
the mortgage finance industry. 
In 1986, Don founded the New York Association of Mortgage Brokers and was later 
elected as president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers. He was also 
on the Board of Governors of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America as well 
as their exclusive Executive Committee. After reaching this pinnacle, he sold his 
mortgage company and built a mortgage broker franchise—the first of its kind. He 
quickly built this to 760 franchise units nationwide and sold it within three years. 
He then started a publishing company, which created Youth Soccer, the official 
newspaper for NYS Junior Soccer. He built it to 167,000 copies per month with every 
edition earning a profit. 
Don also built successful technology firms during the dot-com boom before re-
entering the mortgage industry to build MortgageSelect.com to the 5th largest online 
only, Direct-to-Consumer mortgage company in the nation. Then, as president of 
Third Party Lending at American Home Mortgage (AHM:NYSE), he orchestrated the 
growth of American Brokers Conduit to the 6th largest wholesale mortgage lender in 
the nation originating over $44 billion in mortgages in just one year and earning a 
net profit in excess of $300 million! And although the volume and the rankings are 
impressive, Don is most fulfilled by the retention rate (the rate salespeople remained 
with the firm from year to year). ABC’s retention rate was over 93%, while its next 
closest competitor was only at 52%. This number speaks directly to the culture and 
the quality of the team he helped build.
In addition to reaching the top of the mortgage lending industry multiple times and 
the soccer publishing industry, Don also ventured into the entertainment industry by 
founding the predecessor to Corner Store Entertainment (CSE). In very short order, CSE 
produced six major motion pictures and the Broadway musical Rock of Ages, which 
is currently one of the longest-running plays on Broadway of all-time according to 
Playbill. Some of the actors in the films that CSE produced are: Natalie Portman, Tom

Cruise, Julianne Hough, Alec Baldwin, Mark Ruffalo, Joseph Gorden Levitt, Orlando 
Bloom, Juliette Lewis, Chloë Sevigny, Laura Linney, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta 
Jones, Paul Giamatti, and Bryan Cranston.
Among other ventures, Don also created a firm to buy, fix and sell hundreds 
of foreclosed properties in less than two years – selling each one for a profit. 
Additionally, Don is the founder of various Internet applications as well as an 
eyelash growth company based in Vietnam.
Outside of building businesses, Don enjoys time with his family, helping others, 
playing racquetball, golf, boating, exercising, travel and eating healthy.

COMBINING SUCCESSFUL PARENTING AND BUSINESS
CHAPTER 56
COMBINING SUCCESSFUL 
PARENTING AND BUSINESS
BY ERIK ROBERTSON
As an Educational Psychologist I have been working with professionals 
from all walks of life and from all over the world. For 15 years, I have 
been privileged to work with thousands of parents who have trusted me 
with their parenting challenges. When I share my parenting insights, 
methodology and practical tools with them they will often exclaim, 
“Why didn’t I know this before!?”
Hereby clearly indicating the huge lack of awareness in many parents 
about what Parenting is really about: YOU.
This made me decide to write my first book: Oops, The Parenting 
Handbook: I wish I had known this before. I have seen thousands of 
problematic and challenged families flourish and become happy, 
dynamic, contented families. I have seen countless children and 
teenagers get back on track and reclaim their happiness, so I know this 
works.
In this new book with Brian Tracy, I am sharing some of my parenting 
tools that are specifically related to the theme: How to be a Successful 
Business Person while being a Successful Parent.
My Parenting books are also based upon my other educational work. I have 
been Chairman of a Dutch Educational Network, I am a keynote speaker 
at many Educational Conferences all over the world. I have co-developed 
a Mentoring Pilot at one of India’s most prestigious universities.

TRANSFORM
502
I also give Parenting Workshops to parents all over the world, from Los 
Angeles to Atlanta, and from Dubai to Amsterdam and Istanbul. Parents 
say they feel truly inspired, supported and empowered by my parenting 
insights, tips and methodology.
It is my hope that you are successful in combining your parenting with 
your business.
You want your child to be successful, and you want them to be a great 
person. This chapter will discuss how you go about doing that.
In this inspiring book about how to be a great business person, we will 
now look at the tools needed to also be a great parent.
Being a successful business person will positively affect your parenting, 
as being a great parent will empower you to be even more successful as 
a business person.
Before we continue we need to look at a few important contextual 
aspects regarding parenting today.
How is it that we are trained for everything in life, yet for the most 
important task, that of parenting, we are expected to make do? The 
information that we use to carry out our parenting is largely based on 
advice from our parents and grandparents, various books, websites, 
magazines, blogs, as well as neighbors and friends. Often, most of that 
information will be conflicting in nature. Obviously that does not do our 
parenting much good.
How is it that we are living in the Information Age, or the Age of 
Technology, yet our educational system is a relic from the Industrial 
Age? Our current educational systems around the world are all modified 
systems from the early 1900s.
Sure, it all looks modern and high-tech, but the actual pedagogical and 
grading systems are dinosaurs in need of change.
Experience and research shows that when your parenting goes through 
moments of crisis, you will unconsciously revert back to how your 
parents and/or educators treated you as a child. More often than not 
that approach will not be what is adequate or effective in the current 
situation.

503
COMBINING SUCCESSFUL PARENTING AND BUSINESS
The quality of our parenting today will determine the future of our Great 
Nation. This means there is a moral aspect to our parenting. In order to 
rise to this wonderful and sometimes daunting challenge, it is necessary 
for you as a parent to critically and honestly appraise your parenting. This 
will make you more effective as a parent, benefitting your child(ren), 
your family, and yourself as a Successful Business Person.
According to research, we are living in the most rapidly changing era 
ever. New technology is available at a rate faster than ever before. This 
has implications for our parenting. It means that the home is under 
constant “attack’’ from outside sources. As a parent, you need to think 
about what your family values are and how to give shape to those values.
You now have a contextual framework of aspects that have a strong 
influence on your parenting.
The next aspect of Successful Parenting that you need to look at is YOU.
Parenting is all about YOU as a parent. We are told that good parenting 
is all about the child, and though that may be true, it is my experience 
that it is mostly about you as a parent.
Successful Parenting is about being a Successful Human Being. And 
being a Successful Human Being enables you to be a Successful 
Business Person. A win-win situation!
If you look at the “Business of Parenting,” the yield or the results will 
depend, of course, on the input, on your investment and efforts. This is 
important to keep in mind!
Depending on the circumstances, you will have a limited amount of 
time to spend on your parenting. In an ideal world, you will want to 
spend as much time as possible with your child or children. If you are 
already a Successful Business Person in the sense that you are financially 
comfortable enough to determine your own work schedule. Then that 
will allow you a maximum time investment in your parenting.
In most cases you will be on your way to becoming a Successful 
Business Person, and most likely you will be investing as much of your 
time as possible in your work.

TRANSFORM
504
That means that there is a limited amount of time that you have available 
for your parenting.
How to optimize that time is the question that you need to keep asking 
yourself.
You want your parenting to be a success. You want your children to 
become successful in life. You want them to become great and/or good 
children. In order to achieve this important goal, you will need to be 
willing to work on yourself.
If you are in a partnership or marriage, there must also be a willingness 
to work with each other in facilitating each other’s growth as parents. 
This process requires that you become conscious at all times of what 
you are feeling, thinking and doing.
In my 15 years of experience as an Educational Psychologist, I have 
discovered that those parents who are willing to enter into the above 
mentioned commitments, are highly successful as parents, and for those 
who are business people, they become very Successful Business People.
In this chapter, I will share some of the secrets that will enable you 
to become a successful parent, which will allow you to make your 
parenting into all that you need and want it to be.
TIP NUMBER 1
Prepare for your parenting as you would prepare for a 20-Year Business 
Project.
Now many of you are probably thinking: ‘’How on earth do I do that!?”
Let me tell you how:
As I said before, (Good) Parenting is all about you:
This means that you have some homework to do before you become a 
parent. If you are already a parent, then consider it a refresher course.
You need to take a good look at how you have experienced your own 
parents, caretakers, teachers and other authority figures throughout your 
childhood.

505
COMBINING SUCCESSFUL PARENTING AND BUSINESS
These people all have had a significant influence on your (subconscious) 
ideas and beliefs about parenting. Research and experience teach us 
that during your parenting, and especially so in difficult moments, you 
automatically and often unconsciously revert back to what your own 
parents did with you.
Now therein lies a problem. That behavior might have been appropriate 
or effective back then, but more often than not, it is not adequate in the 
current situation.
Becoming conscious of what your ideas and feelings are about parenting 
is the most important first step that you need to take. Being clear about 
what you can expect from your parenting will be helpful to develop a 
game plan for your parenting.
If you have a partner, you will need to discuss your findings about 
your past parenting influences so that you are aware of each other’s 
conditionings and views. All too often parenting fails due to the partners 
not being aware of their possible differences or handicaps.
Positively, parents who do evaluate their own experiences together 
become highly effective in their combined parenting efforts. Children 
feel that their parents are on the same page and that makes the children 
feel safe and empowered. Having happy and motivated children again 
motivates you as parents and everybody benefits.
Part of the 20-year plan is that you ask yourself the following questions:
•	 What kind of person do I want my children to become?
•	 What values should they embody?
•	 What do I think constitutes a good/great human being?
•	 How will I go about achieving these objectives?
TIP NUMBER 2
Be real, be authentic, and be honest.
As children we were all authentic, real and honest. We showed the 
world how we feel. Slowly, the world started telling us that we would 
be rewarded for certain behaviors, and punished for others. We learnt 
what was considered socially-accepted behavior (according to our 
surroundings), and we adapted.

TRANSFORM
506
In doing so, all too often we learnt to be fake, not true to ourselves, but 
true to others, in order to get the (social) acceptance we so desperately 
needed.
When we become parents, or as parents, we need to realize that our 
(young) children are still in touch with their inner core, and are pure, 
loving and authentic.
That means that they see through us when we fake it. It also means that 
they get confused when we are not being truthful, or when we think one 
thing, but say something else, or-the worst, when we say “Do not do as 
I do, but as I say.’’
So, unity of thought, word and deeds is key for Successful Parenting!
TIP NUMBER 3
Think about the three major parenting styles and ask yourself which one 
would work best for you and why.
There are three main parenting styles:
1. Permissive
2. Authoritarian
3. Authoritative
Permissive Parenting
Permissive Parenting is often seen when parents are too easy going, 
when parents allow their children too much freedom. Experience shows 
us that children can only handle a lot of freedom and space when they 
have achieved a degree of maturity. When lacking that maturity, too 
much freedom usually leads to licentious behavior.
Authoritarian Parenting
Authoritarian Parenting was the most used parenting style of the 20th 
century. Parents are often harsh, punishment is doled out freely, children 
are allowed very little freedom, and the parents word is law. This 
parenting style often leads to fearful and/or rebellious children.
Authoritative Parenting
Authoritative Parenting is by far the best parenting style. It fosters 
mature and responsible children.

507
COMBINING SUCCESSFUL PARENTING AND BUSINESS
Authoritative Parenting has an optimal mix of freedom and rules. 
Children are seen as mature partners in the common goals of parenting. 
Children are given lots of freedom, while at the same time disciplined 
and guided by clear rules, boundaries and consequences. Just like in real 
life in the outside world, they learn that the home is not a hotel, but a 
shared place that is governed by clear rules and regulations.
This is done in a climate of love and compassion and devotion, which 
allows the children to feel safe and loved. Boundaries are not restrictions 
but useful and necessary tools.
TIP NUMBER 4
Celebrate each other. Empower each other as parents, or empower 
yourself as a single parent.
As a successful Business Person and as a Successful Parent, you will 
most likely have hectic, busy schedules, and being a Successful Parent 
will require for you to invest a lot of your time.
Do not delude yourself into buying in to the myth of quality time! To a 
child there is no such thing! There is only time! And lots of it!
Being a Successful Business Person often may mean that there will be 
less time available for you as parents. So if you are a couple, spend time 
every month on a wonderful date just the two of you. If you are a single 
parent, find ways to spend real “you time’’, where you pamper yourself 
and take care of your needs.
As a couple, use your time out time to enjoy, celebrate, relax, and also 
use it to evaluate how you are doing.
These simple but far-reaching moments together will keep you focused 
on your main parenting goals, and at the same time provide you with 
time to mentally and emotionally recharge yourself as a parent.
TIP NUMBER 5
LOVE:
Tip number 5 is the most important tip. Without love as the foundation, 
all others tips will become mere window dressing.

TRANSFORM
508
Love is all about learning to love yourself unconditionally, at the same 
time loving others unconditionally. Only when we love ourselves 
unconditionally will we be able to let our unconditional love flow 
towards our children. This is not the same as unconditional love of their 
behavior.
There can be times when you find it difficult to love them due to some 
unwanted or difficult behavior. At times like that it is important, that 
though you might not approve of their behavior, that you keep loving 
them unconditionally for who they are. That way both you and your 
child stay empowered and strong.
CONCLUSION
You are now aware of five instrumental and effective tips that will enable 
you to be a Successful Parent while being a Successful Business Person.
I support you unconditionally in your quest for excellence in the above.

ABOUT ERIK
Erik R. Robertson, M.A., was raised in Tokyo, Oslo, Abidjan and 
New York, at English/Canadian, French, Norwegian and Dutch 
schools. He graduated as an Educational Psychologist with 
honors and top of his class in (Educational) Psychology at the 
University of Amsterdam.
Erik first worked in the garment trade, doing millions of dollars in sales. The company 
he helped found then went bankrupt, an enlightening and difficult experience that 
made him question his life and goals. He was then signed up by one of Hollywood’s 
most successful agents and sent to acting school in NYC. Despite this golden 
opportunity, Erik decided to move back to The Netherlands; he was driven by the 
need to help his fellow men and he did not feel a glorious acting career was the path 
for that goal.
In the course of the 90s, Erik worked as a psychologist for various Institutions. 
Erik founded his own company Corporate Health in the late 90s with an accent 
on coaching, vitality (and stress-prevention), (no-nonsense and goal-oriented) 
Teambuilding, Human Values and Corporate Social Responsibility; and also Inspiration 
(Reawakening the Spirit in Work). He works as a Life Coach for CEO’s from many top 
Fortune 500 companies as well as for managers working in various profit and not-for-
profit Organizations. Erik has trained most front line healthcare workers from almost 
every Foundation in the Netherlands.
Erik states that: “People (and this also applies to companies) are able to be in a state 
of what is known as ‘flow’; instead of living and/or functioning in light neuroses that 
we regrettably refer to as our personality (or when speaking of companies: that part of 
the company culture that is implicit and often subconscious if you will.) Our personality 
(and/or the aforementioned culture) is often made up of many conditionings that in 
reality serve no purpose other than encapsulating our true and grand potential.
To be in a state of ‘flow’ can be experienced when you transcend the person you 
think you are, or when you transcend the existing company culture to excel even 
further. Needless to say the results are spectacular. Employees’ performance 
rises, communication improves and increases and work attendance improves 
dramatically…to name but a few benefits.
 In the case of parenting, families become happy, loving and constructive environments 
in which both children and parents flourish! Recently Erik co-developed a Mentoring 
Pilot at one of India’s most prestigious International Universities.

TRANSFORM
510
During 15 years Erik had a successful Parenting practice as an Educational 
Psychologist in The Netherlands. He worked with thousands of parents from all walks 
of life and from all nations.
He also gave Parenting workshops at The American School of The Hague (ASH) and 
The International School of Amsterdam (ISA). He currently gives talks and workshops 
on Parenting all over the world.
Based on his extensive research and experience he has written:
Oops! The Parenting Handbook: I wish I had known this before…

It is Erik’s mission to inspire, support and empower parents with his loving yet down-
to-earth and practical book.

PERSONAL LEADERSHIP
CHAPTER 57
PERSONAL  
LEADERSHIP
BY ERIC SACHETTA
Have you ever felt as though you weren’t in charge of your own life? 
Have you ever lacked the confidence in knowing that you could “lead” 
yourself? Ever questioned your ability in leading others and couldn’t 
imagine a way to make a positive difference in the world? After all, 
you’re just one person, right?
Well, about seven years ago, I was in the same mental state that I’ve 
described above. I didn’t know who I was, where I was going, or how 
to begin to fix this lost feeling. The good news: I found the solution. 
I’ve since experienced a life where I am in charge and have confidence 
to lead myself in order to pursue my mission of making a positive 
difference in the world.
Among other achievements within the past seven years, so far I’ve 
accomplished the following: developed an incredible relationship with 
friends (old and new) who I now consider my family, fallen madly in 
love with an irreplaceable woman (and had the honor of marrying her, 
too), earned a top spot in personal sales for one of the most respected 
sales and marketing companies in the industry, successfully ran a district 
office for said company where I personally mentored, coached and led a 
team of young sales representatives to earn a spot in the top five district 

TRANSFORM
512
offices in the New England Division, and founded life coaching and 
motivational speaking businesses where I mentor business owners, 
recent college graduates, and current college students. 
You might be wondering why I’m sharing this with you. Or maybe, 
“How was Eric able to achieve so many great things in such a short 
time? What does he have that I don’t and why should I care?”
Here’s your answer: the biggest impact on the above achievements, 
without question, was when I made the simple decision to become a 
Personal Leader. I chose to overcome what seemed like an impossible 
challenge, changed my belief in the many obstacles I faced, and instead 
viewed them as opportunities. You can make that same decision. YOU 
can achieve greatness. Still having doubts? Join me for a brief look at 
my journey and how you can create your own pathway to success.
MY “DEFINING MOMENT”
Before I share my story, you might be wondering what I mean by 
“Defining Moment.” Our lives are compiled of many moments; some 
seem minor, some incredibly significant. Moments pass by instantly; 
some remembered, some forgotten forever, and some we use to define 
a positive change. Have you ever heard a parent say, “My life changed 
the moment my son/daughter was born...”? In their mind, that moment 
holds significance as the start of a new chapter in their life; a new 
beginning. As I share my “Defining Moment,” think of a recent time in 
your own life, when something changed and you knew your life would 
be different. It could be something like when you decided which college 
to attend, or when you broke up with a significant other. Whatever the 
moment, think back and remember the emotions you were experiencing 
when you were making an important choice. The choice you made, in 
that moment, defines a part of who you are. Now let me take you back 
to the “Defining Moment” that changed my life...forever.
It was December 31, 2007; New Years Eve. I was in college, doing what 
most college students do on the eve of a new year; celebrating with 
friends. We began the night at a friend’s dorm room, starting with the 
traditional snacks, drinks and confetti. When we left to head to Boston 
Common for the midnight celebration, I felt detached and deep down 
I felt uneasy and uncomfortable with my situation. Initially, I ignored 
the feeling. It bothered me to think that someone with an incredibly 

513
PERSONAL LEADERSHIP
supportive family, and who was attending Bentley University (one of 
the top 20 business schools in the country) could feel the way I felt. So 
I brushed it off and continued making my way through the streets of 
Boston, trailing behind my group of friends.
All of a sudden, my world froze. To this day, I couldn’t tell you if it was 
the alcohol, the emotion, the people around me, the time of year, or a 
combination of everything, that caused me to do what I did next. It’s 
difficult for me to specify the amount of time it took for me to realize 
that I was separated from my friends, but when I did, it was nearly too 
late.
I stood alone in the middle of Boston Common, and the detached, uneasy 
feeling flooded my being. The first three strokes of midnight filled 
my ears and vibrated to my core. Rather than joining the celebration, 
I simply stood and stared blankly at the crowds of people huddled 
around me. Couples held each other preparing for their first kiss of the 
New Year. Groups of friends held their drinks high and families with 
beaming smiles chanted the countdown methodically. I felt as though I 
was invisible; as if I was literally watching my life pass by without me.
Overwhelmed with unhappiness, the fourth stroke of the clock chimed 
and I looked down at my hands to verify my existence. A surge of energy 
came over me and I felt as though I was going to faint. “EIGHT, SEVEN, 
SIX...!” the crowd chanted, continuing the traditional countdown. On the 
seventh stroke of the clock, the buildings, lights, and streets of Boston 
Common began to spin uncontrollably. So much so, that I dropped to 
one knee and stared at the ground in an attempt to gain control of my 
thoughts and confirm that the cobblestone beneath me was solid and 
motionless. “FOUR, THREE, TWO...!”
I looked up at the clock and shook my head as if I was shaking away 
any feelings of unhappiness that remained. In the seconds it took for the 
clock to strike midnight and the crowd to erupt, I abruptly jumped up, 
closed my eyes and shouted at the top of my lungs, “NOT ANOTHER 
MINUTE, NOT ANOTHER SECOND, I WON’T STAND FOR THIS!” 
My thoughts started coming in waves: I have a supporting and loving 
family, I’m attending a respectable college, and I have friends who care 
about me. This feeling of nonexistence is GOING to stop and it’s my 
CHOICE!

TRANSFORM
514
From that moment forward, I was a different person; I experienced 
different emotions, different levels of positive energy, and an increased 
enjoyment of life that I’d never felt up until that point. To others around 
me, based on appearance alone, nothing had changed. I was the same 
Eric they had always known and loved. That’s because some of the most 
important decisions in life are personal ones that define who we are on 
the inside. The decision I made to begin living life with passion and 
purpose, defines who I am as a person, son, brother, cousin, nephew, 
grandson, husband, friend, colleague, mentor, speaker, and life coach.
Had I not experienced my “Defining Moment” at midnight on January 
1, 2008, I’m not sure where or who I would be today. What I do know, 
from what I’ve learned and experienced since that moment, is that my 
ability to guide others along their journey to living a life of fulfillment 
is stronger now because of it.
You may be thinking, “Eric, your life couldn’t have switched from 
negative to positive in a single moment.” You’re right. My “Defining 
Moment” provided an opening and opportunity to start the process 
of living life on my terms. All the “real decisions” we make in our 
lives confirm our commitment to a process. What is this “process” 
I’m referring to? Personal Leadership. Over the past seven years I’ve 
been able to develop the process to take charge of my life, lead myself, 
and make a positive difference in the world. It’s a process I choose to 
live on a daily basis to help me achieve extraordinary results and with 
commitment it can do the same for you.
WHAT IS PERSONAL LEADERSHIP?
Personal Leadership is a way of life based on a commitment to personal 
development while exemplifying the characteristics of a leader.
When I first learned about leadership from popular books, guides, and 
programs, I made the assumption that all I needed to do to get started 
in becoming a leader was to have a mission or vision for my life or 
business. The problem: I didn’t have a strong reason for having a 
mission. As I grew and gained skills over the years, I slowly discovered 
my own understanding of leadership. Eventually, I developed the 
process called The 8 Mandates of Personal Leadership as a tool for 
others who were in my position to clarify their understanding of 
leadership faster than I was able.

515
PERSONAL LEADERSHIP
If you don’t understand why you should be a leader, why you should 
take responsibly for your life, and therefore don’t believe you can add 
value to other’s lives, then having a mission holds no significance. In 
my process called The 8 Mandates of Personal Leadership, I’ve learned 
about and describe mission as the seventh mandate. If I continued 
practicing my initial understanding of being a leader, and searched for a 
mission first, I wouldn’t be in the position I am today.
In no way am I discrediting other leadership books, guides and programs. 
Many of my current teachings are based on what I’ve learned from those 
incredible resources. My process was created to offer a unique guide 
in teaching students, business owners and young professionals a step-
by-step process to become Personal Leaders. It’s specifically designed 
to guide you in your transformation in becoming an irreplaceable 
employee, a visionary business owner, and/or a dynamic family leader.
THE EIGHT MANDATES OF PERSONAL LEADERSHIP
1. Perspective
2. Responsibility
3. Accountability
4. Growth
5. Love
6. Lessons
7. Mission
8. Dreams
Most young adults, like my former self, have a general understanding 
of each mandate on its own. The order of the mandates is actually the 
most important aspect to understand. This is one of the reasons why a 
lot of young adults, including my former self, get confused along their 
journey. It’s common to think, “Once I get what I want in life, that’s 
when I will serve and give to other people.” Below you’ll see the skewed 
order of the eight mandates, which is where that thought derives from.
1.	 Dreams
2.	 Mission
3.	 Lessons

TRANSFORM
516
4.	 Love
5.	 Growth
6.	 Accountability
7.	 Responsibility
8.	 Perspective
At age 18, if I had studied the 8 mandates in reverse chronological order, 
this is probably how I would summarize what I learned: “If I first achieve 
my dreams, I will then create a mission, and be able to teach lessons to 
others. Only then will I decide I’m worthy of being loved, giving me 
the ability to love myself, which would then provide me with the means 
to grow as a person. I will then let people hold me accountable for my 
actions, and I will take responsibility for those actions. Overall, I will 
hold a new and improved perspective. As a result of my perspective, 
I will believe 100% in myself and others, and I will be grateful and 
happy.”
As you’ve probably predicted, life just doesn’t work out in the way I’ve 
described above. It’s unfortunate when I see individuals struggle with 
trusting me on this because the above scenario is the very reason why 
so many people give up on their dreams when they’re faced with their 
first obstacle.
When appropriately using the chronological order of the 8 mandates, 
the life summary changes dramatically. Here’s how the 8 mandates 
should be taught and learned: “When I believe in myself, others will 
also believe in my ability. When I then begin taking responsibility for 
my actions I learn to ask others to hold me accountable for my actions. 
When I ask others to hold me accountable, my fear slowly diminishes 
while executing important steps in reaching my goals. I decide to love 
myself regardless of my past because if I cannot love myself, few others 
will. Loving myself will increase my capacity to offer love to others. 
I’m then able to care for others and feel positive emotions, allowing me 
to teach others valuable lessons I’ve learned because of the decisions 
I’ve made. My mission is then created and fueled by the passion I have 
found as a result of initially believing in myself. I’m willing and able to 
add value to the lives of others and I’m then able to achieve my wildest 
dreams.”

517
PERSONAL LEADERSHIP
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BE A PERSONAL LEADER
The eight Mandates of Personal Leadership sound simple, right? Most 
of the time, taking different action steps (mandates) to improve an aspect 
of your life is very simple. The mandates are simple, but don’t confuse 
something being simple with it being easy. If being rich and physically 
fit were easy, everyone would be rich and physically fit. Taking the 
appropriate action steps and committing to follow through until you’ve 
reached your desired goal is one of the most valuable lessons anyone can 
learn. The mandates are simple; committing is the challenge and also 
the reason why most people quit when obstacles present themselves. 
You are clearly not “most” people, or you would’ve stopped reading 
already.
Regardless of your current situation; your social status, your present 
family circumstances, or your level of belief in yourself—you must 
know the following facts. You can change your social status. You have 
an impact on your relationship with members of your family. You can 
change your belief in yourself to accomplish all of those things. Make 
the commitment today to start the process of becoming a Personal 
Leader. All it takes is one moment, one decision, and one initial action 
step to begin your own journey. What will you decide?

CHAPTER 58
GET OUT OF YOUR WAY:  
4 STEPS TO  
IMPROVING YOUR LIFE 
BY DEBRA WAISNER
Do you feel lost, stuck, powerless, worthless, unappreciated, under-
employed, unhappy, like you lost a loved one or in a general malaise? I 
can relate. I’ve had most of those same thoughts, feelings and emotions. 
I have overcome them all and you can too. 
Four years ago, someone asked me how I could be happy and upbeat 
all the time in the face of so many challenges, issues and problems. 
I had to sit down and examine what I was doing. I discovered I had 
developed a series of procedures, practices, exercises, or rituals. Many 
of the practices required years and years of refinement. 
I’m developing a multi-step course to help people overcome their 
negative thoughts, feelings, and emotions to lead a happier, more 
productive and fulfilling life.
Imagine it’s the mid-summer of 2008; you’re working as an Independent 
Consultant. You receive an e-mail informing you that your position is 
being filled by a recent college graduate and you’re asked to train your 
replacement. It’s a blow, but you have 2 other clients. 
A few of months later, you learn that another client has run out of money 
and he is closing his company. The remaining client has expressed 

TRANSFORM
520
interest in expanding your hours. It appears that you will be working 30 
hours a week for the remaining client. 
You sit down in a meeting with the VP of Operations for the last client. 
You’re informed that you won’t be able to keep your current hours 
or expand them because of threats made by a current client of theirs. 
They’re sorry, but they can’t afford to lose the business. You have no 
clients, no current or future income, and no prospects for new clients in 
an economy that has crashed. This happened to me.
For a couple of days, I wasn’t the happiest of person as I pondered the 
future. I made plans. I scheduled time to look for part and full-time 
employment. I asked myself a question: “What do I want to do when I 
grow up?” The answer was instantaneous: a writer. I was not employed; 
had no money coming in to pay the bills; no work prospects on the 
horizon; not eligible for unemployment compensation, and yet I was 
grateful.
You may be perplexed at my gratitude. “What do I have to be grateful 
for?” I was grateful for a new adventure, challenge and opportunity. I 
knew it would not be easy. I would have to overcome obstacles, persist 
in this new vision, and do whatever was necessary to survive and thrive. 
Yes, many items in my life are sideways or even upside down. I struggle 
to pay bills. I ask my parents for help. I work part time as a receiving 
and stocking clerk for a giant store; as an administrative assistant; 
grade standardized tests and finally back into a laboratory setting doing 
developmental work. I have self-published several short books on 
Kindle under a pen name. My life is far from perfect, and I have my 
own sets of struggles and challenges, but I’m grateful. 
GRATITUDE LIST
The first step is to make your own gratitude list. Grab a notebook, journal 
or open your favorite electronic device. Review your world. 
•	 What works in your life?
•	 Who makes you smile or laugh?
•	 What do you like?
•	 What are your dreams?

521
GET OUT OF YOUR WAY: 4 STEPS TO IMPROVING YOUR LIFE 
•	 Who has made a positive impact in your life?
•	 Who would you miss if they moved away or died?
Do the following:
•	 In the next 10 minutes write down a list of eight items or more for 
which you’re grateful.
•	 Add one item to this list daily for the next 26 to 30 days. 
•	 Read your gratitude list twice daily.
Here is a short list of the things I am grateful for: 
•	 Being alive
•	 Family and friends
•	 My pets
•	 To be peaceful, calm and be of help to others
•	 Music
•	 Good book
•	 Sunshine and gentle breezes
•	 Good night’s sleep
•	 Quiet time 
Gratitude is a conscious choice and decision to focus your attention on 
what is right and good in your life. You have the opportunity to look at 
the world through new eyes. The mistake many people make is to focus 
on lack or what is missing, or what they don’t like or want. People will 
say something like, “I don’t have this or if I had that, then everything 
would be great. I hate this job.” The emphasis is negative and their lives 
don’t improve. Choosing gratitude focuses on what’s good instead of 
lack or shortcomings.
Each item on your list is a seed that you plant in your garden. Focusing 
on your gratitude list is like adding water and sunshine to a garden. You 
are cultivating a garden of gratitude. Become the Master Gardener of 
your life.
If a fellow isn’t thankful for what he’s got, he isn’t likely  
to be thankful for what he’s going to get.

HOW DO YOU VIEW YOURSELF?
The average person has 40,000 to 120,000 thoughts a day depending 
on which research you read. Generally, you have the same thoughts 
day after day. Up to 70% of people’s thoughts are negative. You live 
in an ocean of emotion and negative thoughts. Your negative self-talk 
has major impact on how you see yourself. When you don’t control 
your negative self-talk, you’re swimming in shark-infested waters. 
The sharks are darting closer and closer until one shark grabs your leg 
and pulls you under. There’s a way to overcome this negative self-talk. 
Think about the answer to the following questions:
•	 Do You Like Yourself?
•	 Do You Love Yourself?
•	 Do You Have Faith in Your Abilities?
Would you be surprised that many people would answer no to two out of 
three questions? If you don’t like or love yourself and don’t have faith 
in your abilities, who will? Can you give what you don’t have? There is 
a procedure, practice or exercise that you can follow. 
First thing in the morning, go into the bathroom and make eye contact 
in the mirror. Repeat the following phrases:
•	 I like myself.
•	 I love myself.
•	 I have trust in my abilities.
•	 Now give yourself a big hug.
Repeat these phrases three to eight times with the hugs. It should take 
about 15 seconds to one minute.
Do this practice two to three times a day for the next 26 to 30 days.
I can hear some resistance about the hug. The hug is important. Hugs 
release oxytocin. Oxytocin is also known as the “love molecule.” 
Research shows it helps increase self-esteem, feelings of optimism, 
builds trust and help people overcome fears. 
You are consciously making a choice to begin to see yourself in a more 
positive light. You are installing a new program and overwriting bad

GET OUT OF YOUR WAY: 4 STEPS TO IMPROVING YOUR LIFE 
scripts; planting seeds of self-esteem; charting a new course by acting 
as the captain or pilot of your life. If you take no action, then nothing 
changes. 
FORGIVENESS
Forgiveness is tough for many people. If you refuse to forgive, why 
should anyone forgive you? Do you enjoy being angry, hurt, upset, 
wallowing in negative emotions, stressed, and lack of sleep? 
Forgiveness is about healing you. Love yourself more than the anger, 
disgust and hurt for the perpetrator. Forgiveness frees you. You are 
not standing in judgment any longer. You no longer live there. Your 
perception of the event or people changes with forgiveness. You aren’t 
time traveling to the past to visit the incident. You are living in the 
present. You can concentrate on your life, family and work. Forgive 
yourself first and then everyone else. 
Remember Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid. He single handedly defeated 
five attackers by side-stepping their attacks. Mr. Miyagi knew the 
energy of the attacker would boomerang on the attacker. His power 
was to remain nonreactive. Forgiving works in the same manner. If you 
chose to attack back, then a war of words and negative feelings begin 
that no one can win.
The people that upset you most can also be great teachers. Was the other 
person striking out in fear or pain? Does yelling and screaming change 
a thing? Will they be defensive, shut down or change? Can you replace 
your anger, upset and fear with forgiveness? If you can, a new and 
different relationship will be born. You do not have to like them, hangout 
or even be friends. By not forgiving you reinforce their misconduct and 
will only experience more of the same.
When you’re angry, your judgment is clouded and poor decisions are 
made. Look inward. Learn to let go of the grievances, turmoil, hurt or 
how not to get upset in the first place. Forgiveness improves your health 
and well-being. Forgive to help rid your body of dis-ease (disease). 
Forgiving doesn’t mean forgetting or condoning the actions. Your brain 
is wired to protect you and forgetting is problematic. Forgiving means 
you are no longer the victim. You take responsibility for your emotions 
and feelings.

TRANSFORM
524
Is there someone you should forgive? They’re several methods, but the 
one I chose is to write about it. Put it all down on paper and don’t censor 
yourself. Place the writing in a safe place for several days. Take it out 
and read what you wrote. How does it read? I realized that the anger, 
fury and hurt were gone. I held a small ceremony where I burned the 
paper; the flames consumed the words; changed into smoke and were 
carried away by a breeze. I was free. You can do the same practice too.
OVERCOMING FEAR
How do you feel when you’re afraid? Do you stand tall, breathe deeply 
and active? Fear, being fearful and afraid causes you to shrink and fall 
back. Your posture is bad. Your breathing is shallow and you fail to take 
action. What is fear? Fear is the absence of love. How do you overcome 
fear? Find a way to restore love. 
Fear kept people alive. Fear is different today. It paralyzes people. 
Understand that the barriers are your own thoughts that reside in your 
mind. Conquer and vanquish your fears by pouring light into the corners 
of your mind. Fear could be written as follows:
•	 False
•	 Evidence
•	 Appears
•	 Real
Most people’s fear today falls into several categories:
•	 Fear of failure
•	 Fear of embarrassment
•	 Fear of change
•	 Fear of loss
•	 Fear of pain
Fear is the worst kind of grave, because it buries one alive.  
~ Beth Fantaskey 
When confronted with fear, ask the following questions:
•	 What you have to gain from overcoming your fear?
•	 How does your life improve?

525
GET OUT OF YOUR WAY: 4 STEPS TO IMPROVING YOUR LIFE
•	 How does your life change for the better?
•	 What are the benefits you gain from overpowering your fear? 
Name and describe the benefits. 
Where does the “Boogie Monster” reside? What happens when you 
try to avoid the “monster”? The “monster” grows bigger and fiercer. 
Parents vanquish the “monster” by shining a flashlight in all the dark 
spaces: under the bed, in the corners and in the closet. Shining light 
dissolves, disintegrates, and makes the “monster” disappear.
The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.  
~ Joseph Campbell 
Facing your fears takes determination, persistence and belief that the 
gain is worth the effort. Conquering fear builds a stronger foundation 
for your life. There is no courage without fear.
One of the most common fears is the fear of failure. I embrace failure. 
Working in research and development, failure is a constant companion. 
I fail daily; sometimes multiple times in a single day. Learning what 
doesn’t work can be as important as what does work. Keep an open 
mind and be persistent. Fail your way to success. Adversity, obstacles, 
and problems are opportunities in disguise. Solve your problem and you 
can help others overcome the same fear or obstacle.
Thomas Edison failed more than 9,999 times to make a commercial light 
bulb. Michael Jordan failed by missing 9,000 shots, 26 game winning 
shots, and lost 300 games. Babe Ruth is remembered for his home runs, 
but struck out 1330 times. They did not let fear of failure stop them. 
Fear is an opportunity to learn more, be more, and grow into a more 
complete and whole person. 
Your call to action is to list three to eight items where you let fear stop 
you. Answer the questions listed above for at least one item on your list. 
Challenge yourself to overcome one item on your list.
Use the steps discussed above consistently and persistently to improve 
the quality of your life.

REAL ESTATE: FOUNDATION TO YOUR DREAMS
CHAPTER 59
REAL ESTATE:  
FOUNDATION TO  
YOUR DREAMS
BY SHANE WILLIS 
MBA, MARKETING AND FLORIDA REAL ESTATE BROKER
I sat there at 9:00 pm looking at my computer screen. In my right hand 
I had a very strong Bacardi™ and coke. The computer was relaying what 
was happening in the stock market, and more importantly to me, what 
was happening in the real estate market. I was witnessing a crash like 
the country had not seen since the Great Depression. Just to clarify when 
I say I was sitting at home, I mean a home that I could no longer afford, 
and with my family in the other room. I had to find a way to let them 
know the business has now failed. There would be no way to keep up 
the house payment. There would be no way for me to earn the amount 
of income we were used to. I felt like I had hit rock bottom. I blamed 
real estate for failing me. What I did not realize is that I had hit a much 
needed transformation moment. It wasn’t real estate that was failing me, 
I failed real estate.
In the movie Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps, Gordon Gekko – played 
by Michael Douglas – explains to Shia LaBeouf’s character Jake Moore, 
a story about the tulip bulbs and how they were used as a currency. The 

TRANSFORM
528
entire country had gone crazy and started using these bulbs as currency 
to buy things they could not afford. “You could buy a beautiful house on 
a canal in Amsterdam for a few bulbs.” This is one of the first crashes 
that we’ve seen. Real estate is supposed to be that rock solid investment 
that avoids crashes. I’m here to tell you IT IS.
I’m sure many people reading this book would start to raise an eyebrow 
at me right now, considering the recent downturn that we just finished. 
Real estate took a beating at that point. If I had read this book when 
I was sitting in that room in January 2008, I would’ve said the same 
thing. “You are crazy!” Real estate has been the worst investment for 
the last five years. Or has it? What had to transform in me was the 
way I viewed real estate. Once you learn how to view it correctly, it 
can transform many areas in your life, as it is a good, solid vehicle for 
financial independence. Of course, not having to worry about paying the 
bills changes everything. It changes how you look at your business. It 
changes the decisions you make in life like where you vacation and who 
you can help as a charity. Before this transformation happened in the 
year 2008, I saw a lot of those nights with a strong rum-based beverage 
in my hand trying to figure out what I did wrong, and how to avoid it. 
I’m glad to say that transformation did happen, and I can now share it 
with you so maybe you too can avoid as many adult beverages as I did, 
and should be able to avoid half the stress.
CASH FLOW
Cash flow is the only way to look at real estate as an investment. There 
are a lot of television shows showing how you can make money trading 
real estate – like flipping a house. But that’s no different than trading a 
stock – buying it at six dollars a share and selling it at $12 a share. The 
problem is this still requires a lot of your time and effort. If we want to 
use real estate as a vehicle that can transform our financial success, we 
need to look for cash flow. 
This revelation really came to me as I was talking with a mentor of mine 
who bought another investment property at the peak in 2007. I asked 
him how that property was doing and if he had sold it at a loss. Ron 
gave me the strangest look ever and I knew that he knew something I 
did not. He asked a simple question, “Why in the world would I sell that 
property?” Of course my response was simple, “You paid $100,000 for 

529
REAL ESTATE: FOUNDATION TO YOUR DREAMS
this property and now it’s worth $50,000. Why do you still hold onto it if 
you already lost half of your value?” Again my friend gave me a strange 
look, took another sip of his tea, which he then placed down slowly 
and told me these words that I have yet to forget. “You and I look at 
real estate investment differently.” Well, that was a d-u-h-h moment for 
me since obviously he was not upset about it, and I was stressing over 
losing my home earlier in the year. Ron told me, “I only buy investment 
properties for cash flow. Who says I have lost anything?” Of course, 
my curiosity was built at that point, so I asked him to explain. He told 
me, “You’re correct. I paid $100,000 for that property in 2008. It’s now 
2012. I rented that property immediately for $1000 a month, so I make 
$12,000 a year in revenue from that property. That means I have already 
received $48,000 of my hundred thousand dollars back.” Of course I 
knew that, and also knew about tax incentives he received for owning the 
real estate. My friend took another sip of this tea and said, “Shane, again 
you’re looking for appreciation and depreciation only. I’m only looking 
at cash flow. I paid $100,000 cash and I have received $48,000 back. 
The property is still worth $60,000. But I have no intention of selling the 
property. I will continue to collect my $12,000 a year. In 8½ to 9 years 
I will have all of my money back. The purpose of this investment was 
for the monthly cash flow, not appreciation or depreciation.” The next 
thing he said to me changed how I thought. He said, “Appreciation and 
depreciation of real estate investing is just a bonus, never invest for the 
bonus, only invest for the cash flow.”
My friend is not a real estate guy. As a matter of fact he owns a fishing 
company here in Florida. He has 4 to 5 charter boats and he enjoys 
captaining one of them. Ron uses real estate as an investment tool so 
that he can concentrate on his business. He told me that when he started 
investing in real estate before he owned his company, the goal was to 
have enough cash flow to where he did not have to take a check from 
his business. This is what he told me was the success of his business. 
Once his real estate investments were able to pay his bills, he could 
concentrate on his business and make business decisions for the business 
not worrying about if he had enough money for his household. He then 
shared with me how he looked at an investment property in very simple 
terms. These terms that I will share with you now.

TRANSFORM
530
I.   NET OPERATING INCOME
Net Operating Income or NOI is what he was looking for when 
he evaluated any piece of real estate. So what is his formula for net 
operating income? Really simple, you take the gross rental income and 
subtract out the following:
a.	Taxes
b.	Insurance
c.	Association dues (if any)
d.	A Vacancy Factor (usually 1 month’s rent)
e.	A Maintenance Number
Property Price
$100,000 
Gross Annual Rent
$12,000 
Taxes
$138 
Utilities & Trash
$0 
Insurance
$58 
Lawn Service
$50 
HOA
$0 
Maintenance
$50 
Management
$104 
Vacancy Reserve
$63 
Monthly Expenses =
$463 
Annual Expenses =
$5,556 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross Annual Rent
$12,000 
Annual Expenses
$5,556 
NOI =
$6,444 
This should give you your net operating income. Divide that into 
the purchase price and you should get your rate of return. As long as 
that operating income is in the double-digit returns then it should be 
evaluated closely and a due diligence should be completed. 
I immediately looked at Ron and stated, “Well, that’s great for you since 
you had $100,000 to buy a piece of real estate at that point, but I don’t 
have anything right now. I’ve lost my home, my business, and I am just 
scraping by at the present moment.” He took another long sip of his 

531
REAL ESTATE: FOUNDATION TO YOUR DREAMS
tea, which was honestly starting to aggravate me, and said very calmly, 
“That’s exactly where I started. I had to transform my way of thinking. 
That I only invest in real estate for cash flow does not mean that I didn’t 
trade real estate to begin with.” 
I had asked two different questions: 
1.	How financing changes the evaluation of an investment property. 
2.	Coming up with the capital to start investing.
Ron explained that to continue evaluating a potential investment with 
financing, just continue as follows: You take the net operating income 
and subtract out your debt payments. As long as the property is a positive 
cash flow, you may want to invest more time and due diligence into 
the property. If at this point it does not have a positive cash flow, stop 
your due diligence and go find one that will. The ease with which he 
seemed to evaluate properties even took me by surprise (and I am in the 
business). It is truly not an emotional thing at all. He really did let the 
numbers make the decision 100% of the time. 
We finished our meeting, and I asked if we could meet again as I really 
needed to think about the conversation. He said of course, and jokingly 
added, “But next time you’re buying.” I agreed.
Over the next few days, I really tried to put a process together so that I 
could be as calm about real estate as my friend was. It really boiled down 
to digging into real estate and I was able to break down the cycle into 
two simple steps. Okay, one of the steps has two ways of accomplishing 
it, but it is still only two steps. If you are anything like me, you wrestled 
with it really being that easy, but I can assure you it is.
II.(A)   STEP 1: TRADING OR WHOLESALING 
Gathering the capital needed
This step involves the purchase of a property with the purpose of 
rehabbing the property and reselling the property for a profit. The reason 
I put it at step 1 is because this is the way to earn the capital needed to 
invest. 
There are many programs out there that can discuss how to “flip” a 
house, and most of them say the same thing. What I found was that 

TRANSFORM
532
getting in with an experienced rehabber was the best way to learn. I 
asked a local rehabber here if I could shadow him for 3 “flips” just to 
learn the process. I volunteered some of my time as well to ensure he 
got something out of the deal. I did this to LEARN, not for money. Once 
I had a handle on what a rehabber was looking for, I then went out and 
found a property. Negotiations are a strong suit of mine, so I was able 
to negotiate a good price on the deal, by working it backwards from the 
rehabber’s mindset. (This is where that learning comes in handy. If you 
know what they want you can negotiate from a position of strength). 
After I got the property under contract, I went back to the rehabber I had 
studied under and negotiated a higher price for the same property. I was 
able to accomplish this because I knew what profit margins he wanted, 
and I gave it to him. This netted me a $7,284 profit. I did this three more 
times and that accomplished my getting a down payment for my first 
rental.
The other option would have been for me to rehab one of these properties 
myself for an even bigger profit, but I did not want that risk yet, as I was 
still growing in the field and was anxious to get an investment.
II.(B)   STEP 2: INVEST
Use Financing to Leverage the Investment
Next I used the same formula Ron had given me for evaluating properties 
based on cash flow. I found one that gave me a 14% rate of return. I used 
the money I had accumulated wholesaling to put as a down payment. 
Then the cycle started all over again.
I know it seems over simplistic, but it really is that simple. There are 
many hours of learning that happens in each of these steps, but the end 
goal for me and for Ron is to have enough cash flow from real estate 
to be financially independent. This allows me the opportunity to work 
on other businesses and projects I enjoy, without having to worry about 
paying my bills or taking a paycheck. 
There is a reason many of the wealthiest people in the world either made 
or hold a major part of their portfolio in real estate. Understanding NOI 
and using it to evaluate real estate is a path to financial freedom.

THE ART OF EVALUATING YOURSELF
CHAPTER 60
THE ART OF EVALUATING 
YOURSELF
BY ABEL MAXWELL
More people with specific goals on a personal or organizational level 
are going to save a tremendous amount of time and make a lot more 
money in the next few years than ever being made in human history, and 
you have to be part of them. 
In the lines to follow, my purpose is to show you how to start in order 
to make it happen.
That being said, let me introduce to you “The Art of Evaluating Yourself” 
and what it entails to make your ambition a reality and be transformed. 
The evaluation is the first step of the process of reaching any objective 
or goal. It is a critical stage that is unfortunately undermined despite its 
decisive purpose to help your most profound aspirations.
An evaluation is the fact of making a judgement about something; it 
refers to an assessment, a rating or estimation. It is an essential part 
in the process of reaching your goals and objectives. Without it, it is 
difficult to have a clear idea of where you stand, how you do in your 
market, in order to better position yourself in the future or maintain your 
core competencies in your area of expertise.
I have identified three key points that will help you with your evaluation 
whether it is undertaken on a personal or professional level.

TRANSFORM
536
I - Know who you are
II - Know where you are
III - Know how you are
I - KNOW WHO YOU ARE
Being aware of who you truly are and what you do needs to be clearly 
identified and evaluated. Every human being is good at something and 
your job is to find out what’s your God-given or innate gift or talent to 
be fruitful. I have singled out in the next lines some key points to be 
observed for a close evaluation.
- How clear is your intent?
Clarity refers to what you want to achieve; this is absolutely fundamental 
in order to have a clear sense of direction of the transformation 
process. Hence, you should have in writing your vision (know where 
you’re going) and your mission, which will become the blueprint of 
the whole path to follow to reach the target.
Your vision refers to your faculty to foresee your future or the future 
of your organization – whereas your mission indicates your function 
or your vocation. 
Other than informing on your values and what you do, both your 
vision and your mission’s purpose is to help you keep on track with 
your reason of existence and the drive motivating you to reach your 
goal.
Just for a thinking purpose, have you notice that a giraffe does not have 
the same vision as a turtle? Indeed, a turtle eats from the grass whereas 
a giraffe eats from the top of the tree. This means that the altitude of 
your vision will determine how clearly you see and therefore how 
much you can get accomplished on a personal or organizational level.
- Are you proficient in what you are doing?
“In what are you good at?” or “Are you good at what you’re doing?” 
is the question to ask yourself here, because competence alludes to 
the level of your skill. Your talent or gift needs to be sharpened and 
perfected to become a proven skill to be competitive in the marketplace.

537
THE ART OF EVALUATING YOURSELF
“What are your core competencies?” “How committed are you to 
continuous improvement?” are valid questions to assess your current 
state.
- How creative are you?
It’s impossible to have been created by a Creator and not be creative 
as implied by TD Jake’s findings. As a result, as we cannot be creative 
without being connected to a Higher force or a Higher inspiration, it’s 
important to be connected to that Higher Source through our inner 
guts and intuitions.
Successful people are people who follow their intuition; they are 
not necessarily the smartest, but they just dare to follow their inner 
guts. For instance, most people have had an experience of creating 
something and procrastinating to develop their idea before somebody 
else does it before their very eyes.
II - KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
Having a clear understanding of your situation in the present moment 
is the first key because it refers to the beginning of the whole process.
a) SWOT 
You can complete a SWOT analysis, which will help you highlight your 
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and your Threats.
You might want to have them in a table for visual purposes to maximize 
your efficiency and effectiveness in this step; this is the SWOT analysis 
of the current situation: 
•	 Your Strengths are characteristics that give you or your 
organization an advantage over others.
•	 Your Weaknesses are characteristics that place you at a 
disadvantage relative to others.
•	 Your Opportunities are elements where your competition is not 
performing well.
•	 Your Threats are elements where your competition is performing 
well and elements in the environment you cannot control – that 
could cause you trouble.

TRANSFORM
538
Your Strengths and your Weaknesses are from internal origins whereas 
your Opportunities and your Threats are from external origins.
The reason why the SWOT analysis is important is due to the fact that 
its purpose is to inform you of later steps in planning to achieve your 
goal.
b) STEEEP
You can also examine the STEEEP analysis, which refers to Social, 
Technological, Economic, Environmental, Ethical and Political factors 
that could affect you or impact you or your organization:
•	 On the Social level: it’s essential to reflect on how your objective 
or goals will socially affect the social environment taking into 
account population demographics of the target market. 
•	 On the Technological level: the online world is huge and 
enables you or your organization to reach even more prospects. 
It’s important to ponder on how you can make use of the 
technological advances with tools, such as social media and 
software available, to help you boost your visibility in the 
e-marketplace.
•	 On the Economic level: ask yourself if your target market is 
economically reachable to purchase your services or products at a 
profitable price.
•	 On the Environmental level: are you having a positive or a 
negative impact on the environment (environmentally-friendly or 
not) – as this is becoming an increasing concern nowadays.
•	 On an Ethical level: depending on the value system and principles 
that govern the culture of the target market, your practices should 
not come across as offensive and illegal as far as the country’s 
laws and regulations are concerned.
•	 On the Political level: ask yourself if the political environment 
is favourable for what you or your organization is planning to 
undertake.
The purpose of knowing where you are is a prerequisite to knowing the 
direction in which you are going.
By setting your goals and objectives, it’s easier to set your action plan. 
By having it in writing, you become more accountable to yourself and 

539
THE ART OF EVALUATING YOURSELF
to your organization to where you are going. By proceeding with a step-
by step “pros and cons” analysis and methodically following through will 
propel you forward and eventually bring you closer to your intended goal.
III - KNOW HOW YOU ARE
- How confident are you?
Self-esteem is the prerequisite to quality of relationships and is the 
key ingredient of your confidence magnitude. Unfortunately, it is not 
possible to learn confidence in a seminar or in a book. However, you 
can improve your confidence level by doing certain things over and 
over again because self-doubt is the great paralyzer of achievement. 
Confidence comes from not always being right, but not fearing to be 
wrong as Peter McIntyre indicated.
Your confident walk in the direction of your transformation, and 
acting as if it was impossible to fail will qualify you for your ultimate 
success. Your true beliefs are always expressed in your actions and 
rarely in what you solely say.
- Are you considering the quality of your relationships?
Life is all about relationships. In my view, the quality of your 
interactions will determine your level of happiness and success. 
You need to develop your people skills – which encompass effective 
listening communication skills. You can increase the extent of 
your vocabulary and become a better thinker, which leads to better 
communication.
For example, if you decide to learn one single word everyday, you 
will learn 365 words per year. What’s fantastic is that every word 
will introduce you to ten more other words and if you continue this 
method, you’ll become the most educated person in history in the next 
couple years. 
As a matter of fact, the average child learns five thousands words in 
his first five years of life in comparison to the average adult learning 
less than five words per year. Thus, the more words you have, the 
better is your thinking, just like the more tools a mechanic has in his 
tool box, the better equipped he is to solve mechanical problems.

TRANSFORM
540
- Are you consistent in your efforts to reach your goals?
It is commonplace to realize that every great success was at one time 
a failure and that every success is the accumulation of thousands of 
little things that were invisible to most people.
Let me use an anecdote to illustrate consistency; there were frogs 
lining up for a race to climb the Eiffel tower in Paris. Many frogs were 
at the bottom and started the race, while way more other frogs were 
cheering the most courageous at the beginning of the race.
As soon as the race started, some of the frogs in the crowd started 
discouraging those climbing by saying “you better stop because you 
might fall down from the tower and it’s too dangerous.”
As they kept on racing, one frog was still going on slowly but steadily, 
while few of them in front started slowing down and eventually 
stopped the race as the discouragement grew more and more intense.
At some point, that one frog still climbing went ahead of the other 
frogs despite the dissuading comments of the entire crowd, and ended 
up winning the race. That frog became the winner and it’s only when 
he got interviewed that the rest of the frogs discovered he was deaf. 
So, surprisingly, he could not hear the demoralizing utterances of the 
crowd. That winning frog was simply consistent in his efforts until his 
victory. This amusing story demonstrates the power of consistency.
In the same line of thinking, as a basketball fan, I noted Michael Jordan 
quoting: “I’ve missed 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 
games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and 
missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is 
why I succeed.” This reinforces the idea that he was just consistent in 
his efforts to make great things happen in his basketball career.
- How committed are you?
Being committed is one of the hardest things to do for human 
beings, and finding the work you can get committed to is key in your 
transformation. In fact, commitment is closely connected to your 
loyalty to your objectives and goals.
As a result, whether it is for your family, your company or your 
relationships, your commitment counts a great deal towards your 
transformation.

THE ART OF EVALUATING YOURSELF
- How are you using common sense?
Some people fail to think things through before acting, that’s why 
you should train your mind not only to think, but also to listen to your 
God-given or innate instinct. It has being discovered that women in 
general have the courage to listen to their intuition, that’s why they are 
perceived smarter than men.
In addition to that, by learning from your setbacks and your 
shortcomings, you’ll develop the capacity to think intelligently and to 
feel instinctively – as action without thinking is the cause of failure.
Socrates quoted “the unexamined life is not worth living” which 
emphasizes that you need to pause and take time to reflect on your 
experiences and think about the past valuable lessons and get wisdom.
- How focused are you?
It is more and more easy to be distracted by all kind of things especially 
with the heavy demands of current society, but by developing a sense 
of urgency, you can make better use of your time and complete steps 
required to reach your goals faster. This will eliminate procrastination 
because the sense that immediate action is necessary to avoid a 
negative outcome will catalyze your ability to perform right away.
By concentrating on what is challenging and necessary, instead of 
what is fun and easy, you can focus on results and not on activities 
that are not relevant to your transformation.
- How courageous are you?
Being courageous is not the absence of fear, but instead, the decision 
to take action despite the fear of the adversity. You need to develop 
your ability to resist fear and engage yourself in the activity in line 
with your transformation goals. In reality, without obstacles, there 
would be no need to be courageous.
If you resolve to never quit no matter what life throws at you, then 
you become unstoppable. At that point, you can be assured to be in a 
position to achieve your goal. 

TRANSFORM
542
CONCLUSION
Self-evaluation is a crucial part of the process of reaching your goals 
and objectives and be transformed. An effective transformation will not 
happen unless these steps and sub-steps are successfully observed and 
completed. In a nutshell, by covering key questions on your level of 
clarity, competence, creativity, confidence, consideration, consistency, 
commitment, common sense, concentration and courage, you can bring 
your potential to fruition.
Personally, I would even recommend a regular evaluation after a pre-
established period of time to reinforce the initial vision and mission you 
have set for yourself and your organization. Furthermore, maximize your 
core competencies more than working on your weaknesses, because that 
what’s giving you or your organization a clear competitive advantage.
Being transformed will be even more remarkable by taking notes of the 
changes occurring – first with a methodical comparison of what was and 
what is new, then what is new and works effectively.
When you have a dream, it’s your responsibility to protect it from 
discouragement and pessimists. Always remember that you cannot eat 
an elephant in a single bite, so you have to cultivate patience through 
the whole process, because as Aubrey Hepburn stated it accurately, 
“Nothing is impossible; even the word impossible says, “I’m possible.”
That being said, complete your evaluation and confidently reach your 
aspirations to live in peace, prosperity and purpose.
Blessings,
Abel Maxwell

CHAPTER 61
SHARE FIRST 
THEN SUCCEED
BY BRIAN BECK
At my heaviest, I was 487 pounds. I was laid off from my radio job as 
a Talk Show Host in Dallas, TX at the beginning of 2003. In June of 
that same year, I had an opportunity to travel to Orlando to interview at 
another station. I was told as I boarded the plane that I was too big and 
needed another seat. I couldn’t afford to buy another full-priced seat 
and I didn’t have the time to see if the company I was interviewing with 
would pay for it. Completely decimated, I wasn’t allowed to fly and I 
lost out on my interview. That is when I decided to have gastric bypass 
surgery. I truly believed it would be my cure. It did temporarily save 
my life, but it didn’t change my way of thinking. I lost 200 pounds! 
Amazing, right? Over them next 6 years, I would manage to gain back 
150 pounds and stretch my stomach back to my normal size. I tell you 
this, because I still hadn’t taken responsibility for my actions, nor had I 
accepted the fact that I was in control, if I wanted to be. I wasn’t ready 
for change.
June 20, 2009. That is the Saturday I hit rock bottom. Everyone has a 
different “rock bottom.” I was driving home from my job as a Radio 
Traffic Reporter and really frustrated with life. I had nearly gained 
all the weight back that I lost from gastric bypass surgery. “Over 400 
pounds again!” I repeated that phrase over and over in my head while 
on the service road of the Dallas North Tollway heading home to Plano, 
TX. Driving my Saturn Ion and nearly in tears, I was run off the road by 

TRANSFORM
546
a new Lexus sedan. In reality, the driver of the Lexus just wasn’t paying 
attention, but I took this personally! 
My car wasn’t damaged, so I pulled into a strip mall parking lot. I was 
37 years old, making $25,000 a year and my health was abysmal. I 
was married to the love of my life, but even that couldn’t bring a smile 
to my face. I called my wife and just yelled in frustration at the top 
of my lungs. I hated my job, my income, my health, really my entire 
life! I blamed everyone. It was my company’s fault. It was my former 
coworkers’ fault. It was the fault of every former radio person that I 
thought screwed me over. It was the government’s fault. No way was all 
of this misery “my fault”!
Arriving at home was no better. Sure we owned our condo, but life was 
out of control. Back up to a size 52 waist, I couldn’t even sit on the 
couch comfortably in sweatpants. I didn’t talk for a couple of hours. My 
wife was crying and begging me to snap out of it. I didn’t know what 
to do. I felt that I had no control over anything in my life whatsoever. 
I couldn’t afford to quit my job. Who else was going to hire a 400 plus 
pound Traffic Reporter? TV was out of the question. There are only 
three real radio companies and they were laying off, not hiring. I was 
stuck.
It literally took me all weekend before I ate anything. I wasn’t trying 
to starve myself; it was depression really sinking in. Sunday evening 
it came to me. If I can keep from eating all weekend, not something 
I recommend mind you, there is something I have control over! I can 
control what I put in my mouth! Nobody has control over my nutrition 
but me! 
In reality, you have control over much more than you realize. Your 
employers, government, parents, friends, landlords, doctors, and just 
about anyone else in your life don’t want you to know that. It’s truer 
now than ever! You have control over everything. How do you take 
control of your life back? You do it one step at a time.
1.	Find one thing that you want to take back control of. In my case, it 
was my nutrition. For you, it could be leaving a bad relationship, 
finding a new job, leaving a treacherous friendship behind, working 
out, going after that goal that’s been on the backburner for years, 
or not being afraid to talk to people! Find one goal and a way to 

547
SHARE FIRST THEN SUCCEED
conquer it! If you’re having trouble finding a goal to go after, use 
nutrition. It’s something everyone can do! 
2.	Get out a piece of paper and brainstorm. I’ll be using nutrition from 
here on out, but you can replace nutrition with anything. First, 
you need to figure out exactly what you want to change. It can 
be weight, measurement, or just feeling better. I couldn’t weigh 
myself at the beginning because my scale didn’t measure above 
300 pounds. Therefore, I wanted to just feel better and go down in 
clothing sizes.
3.	Put a short-term goal and plan together. I don’t count calories. We 
all know that eating five to six times a day and eating the right stuff 
works. 
4.	What is the right stuff? I’m not a Medical Doctor or a Nutritionist, I 
can only tell you what worked for me. No processed foods. Outside 
of supplements, if it came in a box or wrapper, I didn’t eat it. Fresh 
meat, vegetables, and fruits. Simple huh? Not until you TRY to 
make it hard. Before you ask me if something is ok to eat, I am 
going to tell you no. If you don’t know, don’t eat it. There were 
a few exceptions to my ”no packaging” rule. I do eat real butter, 
olive oil, coconut oil, roasted/unsalted almonds, and occasionally 
brown rice or plain oatmeal. Notice that bread IS NOT on the list!
5.	Plan your meals out! Know exactly what you are going to have for 
each meal the next day. Get a soft cooler to carry with you. If you 
drive a lot, get a plug in cooler for your car. Everyone can do this. 
If you have your food planned out, you are far less likely to make 
bad choices.
6.	Forget about yesterday. So you fell “off the wagon”. That was 
yesterday. This is TODAY! You can’t do anything about the past, 
but you can learn from it. So don’t let yesterday’s bad decisions 
determine what today’s decisions will be. Every decision you make 
right now WILL determine your future. 
7.	Do NOT EVER go through a drive-through window. I don’t care 
if it is something healthy you are ordering. Get off your butt and 
go into the restaurant and order it from a person at the counter. Or 
better yet, don’t go into a fast food restaurant!
8.	Eating right is too expensive? Try eating what’s in season. Read the 
grocery store advertisements. Summer is berry and melon season. 

TRANSFORM
548
Winter is squash and citrus season. You get the idea. When produce 
is in season, it’s cheaper!
So, we have the food and nutrition covered. Now, how do we change 
our mindset? I set a plan together to be able to afford to quit my job. I 
started saving money and training people on the side for extra income. 
More for experience, because I decided I wanted to become a Personal 
Trainer! You may not realize this, but you do not need to be certified 
to be a Personal Trainer. It’s an unregulated industry. I did want to get 
certified and do things right. I had a background in Sports Medicine 
from the early 1990’s in college, and I decided things would come full 
circle! I did earn my certification and started my business. The radio 
traffic company I worked with purchased their competition and laid 
off most of them. While I was promised a raise, my new boss refused 
to honor it, so I was stuck making $25,000/yr. Plus, I was now doing 
over 80 traffic reports in 8 hours in 6 different cities! I was told to use 
different names in every city as well. This was not fun in the least. They 
were all recorded into a computer and just sent to stations in Austin, San 
Antonio, Houston, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, and Phoenix. This was when 
I turned in my 2 weeks notice. 
When you make a decision like that, you better be ready to work your 
butt off in your new business because being successful is all up to YOU! 
Now, I had a new goal and it was time to fight for myself again! This is 
how I started from literally no clients to having a waiting list today. This 
will work for any person wanting to improve their business outlook.
1.	How much sports radio, music radio, or news radio do you listen 
to on your commute? I worked in media for a long time as a Radio 
Talk Show Host, Music DJ, Traffic Reporter, and many other jobs. 
The only things they care about are ratings. It’s ALL entertainment! 
“If it bleeds, it leads,” was a phrase I heard many times. Inherently, 
there is nothing wrong with that. But when you listen to people 
angry, yelling, making negative comments, and doing whatever 
they can to keep you tuned in, what do you think that does to your 
head? I’m a firm believer in reading and listening to books on tape. 
Even when I work out, I listen to books on tape. I pick books about 
positive thinking and growing my business. I find that to be much 
more motivating than any song could ever be. We need to bombard 
ourselves with positive words instead of the commercials and 

549
SHARE FIRST THEN SUCCEED
negativity we see on the TV or hear on the radio every day. Do that 
for 2 weeks and you’ll see a noticeable improvement. 
2.	Cut out TV. Yes I said it. Maybe keep basic cable around for 
emergency updates, but cut the rest out of your life. Treat it like 
I said to do with cheat meals. Pick one program a week to watch. 
When you do that, you will make sure it’s a fantastic program! 
Think about it for a second, when did watching the NFL ever pay 
you a dime or help you improve your business or life? It doesn’t! 
Unless your business is sports or you have a very important client 
that loves sports, it does nothing but eat up your time. I prefer 
playing sports now! Find a softball league, soccer league, or even a 
running/walking group. Not only do you get exercise, but you also 
get to make business connections. The more people you’re around, 
the more opportunity you have.
3.	Be mindful of the people you spend the most time with. I have 
lost most of my friends and colleagues that I had up until a few 
years ago. My best friend and radio show co-host for a decade is 
no longer in my life. It was my choice. He chose to stay negative 
and it carried over into social media as well as my new business. 
Instead of being supportive, he took every opportunity to bring me 
back down. Again, it was my wife who told me to decide what’s 
best for my life. I knew it was the right decision to part ways with 
my best friend, but it hurt. He was the closest thing to a brother I 
had at the time. The old saying is true, take the top 10 people you 
spend time with, average them together, and that’s you! 
4.	Find people that inspire YOU! They are everywhere, but we usually 
don’t see or know them. The way you find them is striking up 
conversations with anyone who you find yourself next to. I don’t 
recommend that if you are on a street corner and a prostitute walks 
up to you, but just about anyone else, go for it! You never know 
what you could learn! Use every second to your advantage. Talk 
to the checkout clerk at the grocery store, the gas station, the fast 
food restaurant (you really shouldn’t be going there), the person 
next to you at the gym you will now join, or the businessperson 
sitting next to you on the subway. Everyone really does have an 
amazing story to tell and they all want to share it! Smile at them 
and genuinely listen to them. When that happens, you may have 
found your next business partner! At the least, maybe they would 

TRANSFORM
550
be interested in what you do and it very well could turn into a 
business relationship. 
One last nugget I want to leave you with. YOU are in charge of setting 
your own limitations. Everything that has happened to you, up to this 
point, is because of choices you’ve made. You will never be successful 
in your health or business until you take responsibility for where you 
are. Once you do that, you’re on your way! Build other people up. Even 
if someone doesn’t believe in himself or herself, instill in them how 
important they are and what they are capable of. It’s amazing, in return, 
how that will also make you feel! I’m greedy that way. I help other 
people because it makes me feel good doing it. Try it; you’ll probably 
feel the same way! Now go be awesome!

KNOW YOUR NUMBERS
CHAPTER 62
KNOW YOUR  
NUMBERS
BY ADAM WEBER
I spend a considerable amount of my time educating and counseling 
appraisal business owners and real estate investors, all of whom cherish 
a dream of business success. 
Having an understanding of your business’s finances or numbers is 
one of the most important tasks is in keeping your business healthy. 
Nevertheless, many business owners do not pay attention to this 
extremely important task, and, as a result, their businesses pay the price. 
If you have a tough time dealing with the finances of your business, 
you are not alone. There are lots of successful business owners that 
loathe dealing with numbers. They regard managing their finances with 
anxiety, fear, and insecurity. Typically, the argument that is raised is that 
they are simply too busy running their businesses to deal with tracking 
numbers on their financial statements. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, over one-half of all new 
businesses fail within the first five years. The leading causes of such 
failure are:
1.	Business owners often fail to manage their cash flow.
2.	Business owners do not understand their financial statements. 

TRANSFORM
554
The first step as a business owner is to acquire a good knowledge of 
what your financial or “money” reports are really telling you. 
The crucial part is determining which ones are important for monitoring 
and improving your business’s performance and avoiding disaster, like 
the half of new businesses that fail in the first five years of operation and 
the others that fail after the five-year time horizon. 
The profit and loss statement is your best starting point. Information 
from your business’s income statement can be used to make better-
informed decisions about your company’s pricing, margin maintenance 
and expense control.
When you “know your numbers,” you can analyze past trends and make 
estimations for the future. Having a clear idea of how your business is 
doing in terms of revenues and profits can tell you if you are on track to 
achieving your goals, and you can make preemptive adjustments if you 
are not. 
Remember that numbers are the language of your business. 
Instead of having a month of poor sales and contemplating on what 
went wrong, you can track your numbers to see underlying issues and 
fix your problems early on. 
But how do you know if your numbers are good or bad? 
A good example would be your marketing. If your latest direct mail 
campaign generated a 2 percent response rate when all your other direct 
mail campaigns generated double digit response rates, then that is a 
good indication that you need to look closer at your copy or your offer. 
Many companies have seasonal sales cycles and the relevant comparison 
is how you did over that period of time with the same period in prior 
years. This will help you reach what should be every business owner’s 
goal, being more profitable every year. Additionally, you would want 
to compare your results with others in the same industry. Your best 
resource for that is a trade association for your business. When that is 
not available, other resources are accessible at most libraries.
 As a business owner, knowing your numbers is the single greatest 
skill you need in order to launch and grow a successful business and 

555
KNOW YOUR NUMBERS
to maintain your profitability. By knowing your financial numbers, 
you will detect problems quickly and that will allow you to take action 
promptly. You can have the greatest business idea, but, if the numbers 
don’t work, it just doesn’t matter. Let me expand.
Successful business owners understand that knowing your numbers is a 
necessity to survive when running a business. Knowing your numbers 
virtually guarantees you greater success and multiplied profits. 
Here are some numbers that every business owner needs to track. 
Working Capital – Your working capital is the cash or capital that you 
have on hand to manage your business on a day-to-day basis. 
Revenue – Your sales represent the vital source of income for your 
business. This is the money that your business generates from sales 
activity, whether it is on a weekly, monthly or annual basis. 
Gross Profit – This is your sales revenue minus the direct costs of 
producing your product or service. (These costs are your cost of goods 
sold.) 
Operating Expenses – No matter what you sell, whether it is a product 
or a service, if you do not track your expenses, then your profits will be 
minimal and unimpressive. Your operating expenses are the costs that 
you bear to pay your expenses – including rent, insurance, and taxes. 
You not only need to track, but also to control your costs. 
Net Profit – Your net profit is calculated by deducting operating and 
other expenses (such as depreciation) from your gross profit. 
Now that we have covered the basis of knowing your numbers, we can 
look at the essentials that business owners need for effective money 
management. 
Budgets and forecasts go a long way in helping you manage your 
numbers effectively. Many people overlook the benefits of forecasting 
business expenditure for a given time period. In a similar vein, you also 
need to make saving plans. Not to spread pessimism, but there is always 
an element of unpredictability in a new business; so having some 
resources to bank on when things get rough is a wise idea. 

TRANSFORM
556
Keep an eye on your expenses. This cannot be stressed enough. You 
need to account even for the smallest expense that your company makes. 
Of course, this requires a lot of work, but nowadays you have various 
financial tools that have made this job easier 
This is important if you plan to increase revenue by selling additional 
items with your main product. For instance, if you sell mini sound 
systems for $120 each, marketing headsets worth $59 to go with the 
system will result in a 24% increase in revenue per sale. 
Let’s say you spent $800 on web design and SEO. You get 500 hits on 
the new website and 200 of these visitors actually make a purchase. 
So bringing in new customers into your business costs you $4.00 each. 
But you will also have to ensure that each purchase is more than $4.00 
if you want to make a profit. This strategy helps you to formulate your 
marketing budget. 
Calculating what it costs to bring in new customers can be further 
expanded into the following categories.
Conversions - Conversion happens when viewers/listeners of your 
ads (or visitors to your website) actually become paying customers. 
Following on from the above example, 200 out of every 500 website 
visitors become customers, so the conversion rate is 40% (200/500). 
Is this rate good? It depends on what difference these conversions are 
making to your bottom line. 
Response Rates - In traditional direct marketing, i.e., catalogues, 
mailing, and fliers, the average response rates varied from 1% to 5%, 
depending on whether the company acquired the mailing list from a 
broker or marketed it to its existing customer base. In online email 
campaigns, the average response rates tend to be much lower, at around 
0.1%. So to get 20 responses, you’ll need a mailing list of 20,000 
contacts. 
Finally, you should also calculate how many leads (potential buyers) 
make you a sale. This is especially beneficial if you are in the B2B 
industry. For example, if you are selling security systems to banks and 
producing one client takes you 20 prospects, you need to get 2000 leads 
to get 100 clients. 

557
KNOW YOUR NUMBERS
While the above mentioned help create the mindset for effective 
numbers management, they are general in nature and can be applied to 
other areas of your business as well. So here are some advanced tips on 
getting your numbers under control.
LIFETIME CUSTOMER VALUE 
In marketing, Lifetime Customer Value (LCV) is a prediction of the net 
profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. 
The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and 
accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of complex predictive 
analytics techniques.
Lifetime Customer Value is an important concept in that it encourages 
businesses, both large and small, to shift their focus to the long-term 
health of their customer relationships. It represents an upper limit on 
spending to acquire new customers. For this reason, it is an important 
element in calculating payback of the marketing mix modeling.
In simple terms, you have to calculate how many purchases a customer 
makes in money value per year, and then see how long they stay in your 
business. So if a customer shops from you twice a year, paying $150 
each time, and continues to do that for three years, he/she is worth $900 
to your business. This will further help you to create goals like how 
many customers you need to acquire to meet the next financial target, 
etc. 
Some businesses neglect to look closely at their employee costs. The only 
reason to have an employee is to generate profits for your business, and 
many business owners look at one figure – what they pay the employee 
on an hourly basis. This is an ineffective way to analyze your employee 
costs. It is not just the wages that you pay, but taxes, benefits, including 
health care costs, and in some cases, contributions to retirement, and 
bonuses. The costs do not end there. Do you know what your employee 
costs really are? Is there any wonder why the use of contract employees 
and VA’s or virtual assistants have grown? If you have not read it yet 
and you are a small business owner, read Tim Ferris’ book, The 4-Hour 
Work Week. 
Another number to pay attention to is your “Do-Over Number.” Simply 
put, it is the costs that are attributed to the mistakes you make. For 

TRANSFORM
558
real estate investors that I counsel, it can be the cost of scrimping on 
costs associated with repairs and renovations leading to the need to do 
the work over. If you own a restaurant, it can be the cost of having to 
prepare a second dish for a patron because the food was overcooked and 
the first dish ends up in the trash. 
I believe that the second most relevant number is the ROI or Return On 
Investment. This is best defined as a measure of the amount gained or 
lost on an investment, expressed as a percentage of the initial investment. 
Whether you are a real estate investor or an appraisal business owner, 
it matters. 
ROI serves as a tool to help business owners determine the profitability 
of a business venture. More specifically, it reveals the earnings the 
business owner receives for each dollar invested in the business. 
There are several ways to determine ROI, but the most frequently used 
method is to divide the net profit by the total business assets. If the 
businesses’ net profit is $1,000,000 and the total assets are $3,000,000, 
your ROI would be 33 percent.
Return on investment isn’t necessarily the same as profit. ROI deals with 
the money that you invest in the business opportunity and the return you 
receive on that money based on the net profit of the business. The profit 
measures the performance of the business. 
YOUR TIME IS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT NUMBER
The most important number in your business is your time. You can get 
more money through various avenues but once time is gone, it’s gone 
forever. You can’t buy more or borrow more time, so time is a limited 
resource that expires every day. As a business owner, you have to be 
very careful with this precious resource.
With my appraisal coaching clients, we pay close attention to this 
number because they may quote a fee to complete a job in two days and 
it ends up taking a week. This concept goes for all business types. Your 
most relevant number in business is the number of hours that you spend 
on and in your business or, more easily defined, your time. 
The wealthiest business owners know that having some structure to 
their schedule creates a routine of success. Create a daily blueprint for 

559
KNOW YOUR NUMBERS
yourself. If you invest the time in planning, you can add at least an hour 
to your “productive” time every day. That translates to at least five extra 
hours a week, probably more. 
If you don’t already, you should apply the Pareto Principal or 80/20 
Rule to your time and schedule.
When applied to work, it means that approximately 20 percent of your 
efforts produce 80 percent of the results. Learning to recognize and then 
focus on that 20 percent is the key to making the most effective use of 
your time.
You have 10 things you need to do today. The odds are that one item is 
worth 10 times more than the rest. 
In time management terms, it suggests that unless we actually try to do 
something about it then, for most of us for most of the time around 80% 
of what we achieve comes from just 20% of what we do. In other words, 
there is a huge imbalance between effort and results.
It’s like saying that in the equivalent of just one day, we achieve the bulk 
of what we do that is worth doing in the whole week. Our contribution 
in the other four days merely adds up to a small fraction of what matters. 
It’s an appalling statistic but, generally, it has far more than just a core 
of truth behind it. 
However, if you learn from it - this natural imbalance - and start to apply 
standard time management ideas, then you can blow the 80/20 Rule 
apart. You can, indeed you should, spend far more than 20% of your 
time and effort on what matters. You will then achieve far more than 
what you have been used to; not a little bit more, but far more. From 
80/20 you can move to something like 160/50 or even better.
Now that you have a clear understanding of how you can manage your 
business numbers better, here is a summary of what this implies for your 
company:
Clear Goal Setting - You can analyze past trends and make estimations 
for the future. Research suggests that organizations that set goals are 
much more likely to achieve them. Moreover, by having a clear idea of 
how your business is doing in terms of revenues and profits (even on a 

TRANSFORM
560
daily basis), you can tell if you’re on track to achieve your goals, and 
you can make preemptive adjustments if you’re not.
Instead of having a month of poor sales and contemplating on what 
went wrong, you can use your numbers to track underlying issues and 
fix problems early on. 
By simply keeping track of things like the value of each sale, number 
of proposals given, and number of leads, you can instantly know which 
area needs to be worked upon.

NEW CHOICE TRANSFORMATION
CHAPTER 63
NEW CHOICE  
TRANSFORMATION
BY LAURA CLANCY
While training at ComedySportz DC, a short-form Improv Troupe, we 
play lots of games to entertain our audience. To make it more fun for 
our “loyal fans”, we play as teams who compete against one another. In 
a battle of wits, it’s the Blue Team vs. the Red Team, but nobody really 
cares who wins. 
 One of the games we play is called “NEW CHOICE.”
This game works as follows: characters, scenes and conflicts are quickly 
created from scratch, and a referee intently watches the scene unfold as 
each word or physical action is uttered by the actor. The referee then 
finds some word or action that would be funny to change and blows the 
whistle and says, “NEW CHOICE!” The actor is then forced to find a 
new word or action to replace the original idea. Once they land on a final 
choice, the scene continues on with the “NEW CHOICE” idea intact.
Well, you can imagine, hilarity ensues and new choices make all actors 
on stage change the scene on a dime. It’s SO MUCH FUN for the 
audience, actors and referee! 
Here’s an abbreviated example of the game: Hal and Sue walk into a 
grocery store…
Hal (sappily): “Sue, I feel lucky that you’re part of my life now, 
since you were quite the catch.  And now that we’re married, I just 

TRANSFORM
564
love grocery shopping with you - it’s really gratifying!!”
Sue (happily): “Thanks Hal. I feel it keeps us more bonded as a 
couple.”
Hal: “I agree, Sue.”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Hal: “I disagree, Sue”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Hal: “Like a ball and chain, Sue.”
Sue: ”Speaking of shackles, have you heard of that new vitamin and 
mineral cereal called ‘Golden Iron’?”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Sue: “Speaking of shackles, have you heard of that new fish called 
manacle?”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Sue: “Speaking of shackles, have you heard of that new adult 
beverage called Unfettered?”
Hal: “No, I haven’t. But, about now, I’d love to release a cold one!”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Hal: “No I haven’t. But you’ve sure become a cold one.”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Hal: “Nope. But, I’d like to make you part of the catch-and-release 
program.”
With the best punch line delivered and the audience howling with the 
twists and turns that have been taken…the referee calls the end of that 
scene…
You may be asking yourself, how does an improv game apply to 
TRANSFORMATION? How can this seemingly nonsensical idea 
change me and help me transform something in my life? 

565
NEW CHOICE TRANSFORMATION
Here’s my vision:
LIFE is the Ultimate Improv Stage 
and every time you seize on a NEW CHOICE, 
Adaptation and Transformation ensue . . .
After all, transformation is about making NEW CHOICES when the 
old choices are keeping you stuck and are only getting you muddy. 
As a professional speaker, I’ve learned more than how to make people 
laugh by practicing this art form. I’ve actually garnered many valuable 
ideas and concepts. For example, I’ve experienced:
•	 Saying “Yes, and” is the answer to successful outcomes.
•	 Complacency should be feared more than failure, in order to grow 
personally and professionally.
•	 Making perfect decisions is not what life is about; it’s about 
making the best out of any decisions that are made. 
I’ve watched improv classes transform shy people into budding 
comedians who change the way audience members see some of their 
own life scenarios. It’s the 21st century’s comedic solutions to real 
problems…Strife, Levity and the Pursuit of Excellence. Isn’t that cool?
As a Professional AND Multi-dimensional Transformer, I’ve learned 
that in order to transform, we must push ourselves to look at the same 
scenario through a different lens and take different actions to get what 
we most desire. We must make NEW CHOICES.
Real Life is full of New Choices practically every minute of every day. 
The choices we make for most things have an impact on everything we 
do. 
There are seven ways in which I think we can meaningfully transform 
ourselves: 
1.	Spiritually
2.	Physically
3.	Mentally
4.	Emotionally
5.	Relationally

TRANSFORM
566
6.	Financially and…
7.	Vocationally
Real life New Choice(s) transformed my life. For me, over the years, 
when one avenue didn’t work as anticipated, it was time for me to make 
a NEW CHOICE. I often think that my life is proof that there are more 
than four traditional dimensions. Let’s put it this way, IMAX would 
need some serious innovation to make the glasses. Ha! Here’s a 3-D 
version of my transformations…
I’ve gone from being a…
•	 stay-at-home mom to founder and CEO of the successful 
MuffinToppled® Enterprises, Inc. 
•	 wallflower to an award-winning speaker
•	 couch potato to a 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation World 
Record Holder.
But, perhaps the best NEW CHOICE I made in life was the first NEW 
CHOICE I made in my multi-dimensional transformation. That NEW 
CHOICE was deciding to go from being a yo-yo dieter to a long-term 
lean-bodied athlete. 
And, from that first NEW CHOICE that I made…
my saying ‘yes and…’ to opportunities…my fear of complacency…my 
realization that moving forward with imperfect action was better than 
standing still with perfect inaction
…came my best idea to help you transform your health into wellness. 
In my opinion, of all the transformations we can make, creating our 
healthful wellbeing is the anchor from which all other transformation 
can occur. “Well”-being, whether it’s moving well, feeling well, and/or 
eating well, is when our quality of life allows other NEW CHOICES to 
be made with ease. 
I’d like to share with you the NEW CHOICES needed to create long-
term healthful transformation…Improv Style:
Eddie and Tilly bump into one another …

567
NEW CHOICE TRANSFORMATION
Eddie (lumbering into Comic Con in a Shrek costume) - “Whoa, 
sorry about that buddy. Hey, you look to be in great shape…YOU 
must be a trainer! Can you get me ready for the Mr. Universe 
challenge in two weeks?”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Eddie (waddling around Comic Con in a Baby Huey costume) - 
“Hey There Tills! Can you help me win the Marine Corp marathon 
next week?”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Eddie (plodding into a gym)—“Hi Tilly. Appreciate you gettin’ me 
ready for my 20th High School Reunion in twelve weeks.“
Tilly (guffawing without restraint)—“HAHAHAHA…
HOHOHOHO…are ya kidding me?!? Forget about it, will ya? ”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Tilly— “Howdy Eddie! Yes I can. And as a person who rid myself 
and my clients of unwanted cankles and muffin tops, I’ve learned 
how to help people successfully reach their ideal weight goals. My 
fat loss system uses three cross-functional components: Mindset, 
Nutrition and physical Fitness. First, let’s work on changing your 
Mindset.”
Eddie (gasping)—“Do I need to, …like, move into a monastery 
cell?…”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Eddie—“Okay mate…ya think a walkabout might be a good idea? 
It’d kill two birds with one stone…to get my mindset there and to 
burn calories…”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Eddie—“AHA, I GET IT! Healthy weight is a lifetime journey, not 
a scale destination.”
Tilly—“Yesiree! That’s the mindset that’ll set you up for success!”
Eddie—“Yay! Score one for Eddie boy!”

TRANSFORM
568
Tilly—“Now, for your nutrition plan, I recommend ‘air gobbling’…
it’s like air guitar without the guitar.”
Referee: “New Choice!” 
Tilly— “Nutrition’s easy to learn! You see, eating well for fat loss 
means eating small meals-every two to four hours—comprised of 
natural foods—a lean protein and a natural carbohydrate.” 
Eddie—“Fantastic! I guess the police force will inherit my daily 
donut forage. I’ll substitute a handful of grapes for my small meal.”
Tilly—“Not exactly…where’s the natural carbohydrate and 
protein?”
Eddie—“Okay, I’ll have a beer with sausage…”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Eddie— “I’ll have an egg and an apple for a snack.”
Tilly—“Ladies and gentlemen…we have a winna’ !!!”
Eddie—“For exercise, how’z about I commit to run 10 miles every 
day enshrining myself in a heavy duty sauna suit?”
Tilly—“With that plan, I think you need to ditch the reunion and 
join Looney Tunes.”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Tilly–“No matter how far you run, it ain’t gonna get you there.”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Tilly–“Ha! For fat loss, I offer a time-saving and buck-banging 
exercise plan. If you Weight Train two to three times a week and do 
interval cardio two to three days a week, you WILL be ripped for 
that reunion!”
Eddie–“Well, that’s not good news…that’s scary and unbelievable…I 
don’t know anything about dumbbells. I only want to look 
INCREDIBLY ripped for the reunion, not HULKY… your ideas 
are not only scary, they’re making me angry. You wouldn’t like me 
when I’m angry….”
Tilly—“Complacency will get you nowhere. Never Fear! Failure to 
reach your goals isn’t likely. You’ll need to be brave and believe that 

569
NEW CHOICE TRANSFORMATION
strength training yields better fat loss results than running.”
Eddie— “That’s MARVELous but, I’m outta here…”
Referee: “New Choice!”
Eddie—“Okay…I’ll make the best out of my decision to bust 
through my fears about strength training…what should I expect in 
12 weeks?”
Tilly—“You’ll be a lean ripped machine and will make your High 
School friends GREEN with envy… Stepping out of your comfort 
zone to reach your goals is something of which to be proud. 
Committing to better health through proper Mindset, Nutrition and 
physical Fitness, will yield BANNER results…”
The Referee blows a long whistle calling the end of scene!
In 2008, my internal referee called the end of my own dramatic yo-yo 
dieting scene, and in the process I found the answer to my client’s and 
my long term wellness. This long term wellness is what I refer to as 
“Black Dress” or “Black Tie” Ready. It’s an easy philosophy to learn and 
includes three components: MINDSET, NUTRITION and Physical 
FITNESS. Each of these components represents the NEW CHOICES 
that must be made to become healthy overall. 
© Copyright 2012 Laura Clancy
The first NEW CHOICE is to take charge of your MINDSET. You 
must understand that “to get a different result, you must have different 
actions.” This NEW CHOICE is SO important; it represents 100% of 
the equation. You need to shift your thinking to the new mindset that 
maintaining ideal weight and health are a life-long journey not just 

TRANSFORM
570
a scale destination. Without the proper mindset, it’s very difficult to 
achieve long term results. You MUST become completely dedicated to 
this journey for the long haul…and then take daily action steps every 
hour, day, week and year to accomplish those goals. Get ready to commit 
to fighting the “bad habits” that have taken your health down a less than 
ideal path.
The second NEW CHOICE, representing 80% of the equation, is 
NUTRITION. Yes, another 80% IS an imprecise factor to get to 100%, 
but I don’t care. I’m trying to illuminate that Mindset is the first important 
NEW CHOICE that you make. Once your mindset is 100% ‘there’, 80% 
of your weight loss and health gain will come from proper nutrition. Here 
are the NEW CHOICE eating habits you need to incorporate into your 
Transformed Life: Eat every two to four hours - “small meals” - each 
small meal should include a lean protein plus natural carbohydrate (fruit 
and/or vegetable OR starchy carbohydrate). Overall daily caloric intake 
for fat loss should generally be between 1500-1750 calories for females 
and between 3000 and 3500 calories for males. Proper nutrition entails 
eating food that is “clean”, meaning from nature and not processed. It’s 
that simple. Very few people will gain weight or get unhealthy eating 
natural proteins and natural carbohydrates.
And the final NEW CHOICE, representing 20% of the equation, is 
physical FITNESS. This NEW CHOICE will have you prioritize 
strength training as your number one exercise choice (also known as 
weight training or resistance training). Strength training is your best 
answer for getting and staying lean. It helps you get stronger, build 
muscle tone, and look awesome all the while increasing your quality 
of life and increasing overall metabolism. Many 21st century dwellers 
lead sedentary lives due to their jobs and long driving distances to and 
from their activities. They become weaker over time so getting stronger 
is the answer to many things that ail them. Strength training is the best 
bang for your buck for a fat-free body and provides optimal health and 
wellness…it’s the elixir of youth! 
When you add it up, that comes to 200%. I’m okay with that gross 
miscalculation if it helps you find your “forever health” and wellness! 
200% is the NEW CHOICE!

571
NEW CHOICE TRANSFORMATION
Long Term Wellness through Mindset, proper Nutrition and physical 
Fitness is the professional or personal transformation tool that will help 
serve you most for all the other remodels you need to make. From my 
experience, I have found that once you commit to making these Black 
Dress/Black Tie NEW CHOICES, you will begin to transform your 
life into a healthier and therefore more content one. 
What’s really ‘neato torpedo’ is that once you get your choices right 
in one area of your life, you’ll be able to tackle a new part of your life 
–with the game of NEW CHOICE busting through and conquering 
any professional and other personal plateaus that may still be lurking 
in your life. 
It’s a NEW CHOICE LIFESTYLE - how ‘awesome possum’ is that?
After all, none of us should get too complacent...

SECOND TIME AROUND: ATTRACTING YOUR IDEAL PARTNER
CHAPTER 64
SECOND TIME AROUND:  
ATTRACTING YOUR  
IDEAL PARTNER
BY MANJ WEERASEKERA 
THE FRESH START GUY
Are you aware that the divorce rate for second marriages is 33% higher 
than the divorce rate for marriages in general? With over one-third 
ending within five years. It’s clear that people do not learn from their 
marital mistakes!
If you are looking for your ideal partner the second or even third time 
around, this quick read will help give you a better chance of finding love, 
happiness and peace of mind. Imagine that? Really feeling happy, with 
the freedom to express yourself in a relationship that could help define 
you even further. And with a partner that supports and nourishes you 
and your goals. So much so that it becomes the springboard to success 
in different areas of your life. Is that possible? Well it was for me and 
continues to be so. And I genuinely believe it can be the same for you. 
Sound good? 
I was married to a beautiful, caring and giving woman and after 17 years 
of marriage and two fabulous teenage boys, we separated. The first year 
was tough; very tough, and I guess that’s understandable. My business 
suffered and emotionally I was pulled apart. Throughout all this though, 
I knew that it was for the best. 

TRANSFORM
574
I now have a relationship with yet another beautiful, caring and giving 
woman; and this time it’s in a different way. I’m now a different man 
and because of the positive changes I’ve made, I have attracted a woman 
who is totally right for me at this stage of my life. The relationship is 
synergistic, where the sum is much greater than the two parts, and we 
are creating a space where each of us can grow and fulfil our potential. 
This has in turn had dramatic effects in several other areas of my life, 
including my health and my business—which continues to grow despite 
the worst recession in history. I have a great relationship with my ex-
wife and our two sons, and continue to love and support them in the 
best way I can. I can honestly say that I now have a sense of freedom 
to be myself and to express myself as fully as possible. This places me 
in a stronger position to be able to support myself in every sense and to 
support those closest to me. 
I was a performance coach working successfully with some of the 
biggest organisations in the world before I turned my skills to this area. 
And what I’m about to share with you now is one step of my five-step 
process: The 5 Deadly Mistakes Divorced Men Make When Looking 
For Mrs Right. And although this is clearly aimed at divorced men, the 
principles are the same whether you are male or female, divorced or 
otherwise. 
I believe too many men leave meeting their perfect partner to wishful 
thinking, and I’m urging you not to make that mistake and to actually 
design the type of person you would like to attract into your life. 
You wouldn’t go on a major holiday without planning in advance what 
you would like to experience: adventure, relaxation, city tours, beach, 
water sports, type of accommodation, etc. You certainly wouldn’t buy a 
car without considering looks, functionality, colour, additional options, 
etc. And many would consider these things less important than the 
person they spend the rest of their life with. 
Designing and planning end outcomes are common practice with regards 
to goal achievement in business coaching and in sports psychology. And 
the mechanics behind them are no different to what we are looking at 
here. 
So here comes the science bit. 

575
SECOND TIME AROUND: ATTRACTING YOUR IDEAL PARTNER
Please allow me to introduce you to the Reticular Activating System 
(RAS), also known as the Extrathalamic Control Modulatory System. 
The RAS is a part of your brain that, amongst other things, is responsible 
for regulating arousal. It also oversees what you concentrate on and 
is the receiver for what you take in through your five senses. More 
importantly, it is the RAS that decides what you become cognitively 
aware of, i.e., it works as a filter within your mind. 
Studies, including at McGill University in Montreal, show that we have 
neurons at the front of our brains that act as filters for information, letting 
in only the most important of the trillions of signals that we receive and 
that constantly battle for our attention. Research shows that the average 
person does not have enough capacity to process all the information 
that bombards our senses. We therefore need ‘gatekeepers’, such as the 
RAS, to stop us overloading on data and to bring our attention to what 
we deem to be important. 
So what’s all this got to do with my next date, you may be asking? 
Well, what should interest you is how your mind decides on what data 
is important enough to filter. Other than some of the fundamentals that 
we appear to have hard-wired into us already (Central Governor Theory 
by Archibald Hill), we can ‘programme’ our mental filters with what 
we would like to attract, so that the RAS can draw our attention to it. 
Just like programming a computer. That then becomes our important 
data. This conditioning happens at the level of the unconscious mind; 
however, the ‘commands’ are made at the level of the conscious mind. 
Therefore, the good news is that you can purposefully programme your 
mind for who you would like to attract into your life. How great is that? 
I use an extremely powerful and highly effective process for this type of 
work with my clients and I will guide you through that now. And believe 
me, it works! 
PART ONE – DESIGN 
You will need some paper and a pen. 
Get yourself into a relaxed and positive state by whichever means works 
for you – this is important and if you are tense, worried or upset about 
something, this may impact the exercise in a negative way. A relaxed 

TRANSFORM
576
mind works at an optimum level. 
Write a heading at the top of the page. Something like, ‘My Ideal Life 
Partner.’ 
Now list out all the things that are important to you about the person you 
want to attract into your life. Start with anything you like; there is no 
particular order. The list does not have to be perfect either. 
Here are some example areas:
•	 What they look like physically – hair colour, height, size, shape, 
eye colour, etc.
•	 How they sound – tone of voice, volume, pitch, etc.
•	 What they are like emotionally.
•	 What interests they have and what they like doing. 
•	 What beliefs and values they have.
•	 How you are physically together.
•	 Their spirituality. 
PART TWO – CONDITION 
Here I will show you how to condition your unconscious mind to enable 
you to filter for your ideal mate. 
Generally, we take in information through our five senses and there are 
six elements overall: 
1.	Visual = What we See
2.	Auditory = What we Hear
3.	Kinaesthetic Physical = What we Feel Physically
4.	Kinaesthetic Emotional = What we Feel Emotionally
5.	Olfactory = What we Smell
6.	Gustatory = What we Taste 
You will need to be aware of each of these elements as we progress 
through several simple steps: 
1.	Think of a ‘future memory’ where you are with the partner you 
have ‘designed’. Think of something you are doing together that 

577
SECOND TIME AROUND: ATTRACTING YOUR IDEAL PARTNER
you both enjoy and is important to you. Just to help illustrate and 
give you a feel for this, we will use the classic example of walking 
along a beach together. It could instead be a night at the theatre, 
skiing down a mountain, trekking across a hill or taking a dance 
class together. Use something you love to do or would love to do, 
but never got the chance to. 
2.	On a fresh page, write out what you are experiencing in this future 
memory using the five senses. 
 Two very important things to note:
-- You must write this out in the present tense, i.e., as if it is 
happening now; 
-- When you are describing the Visual element, you must describe 
what you are seeing through your own eyes, i.e., you do not see 
yourself in the picture, unless it is in a reflection. 
Using the beach walk example:
Visual – “Looking through my own eyes, I see the golden beach 
stretching out before me. The ocean is turquoise in colour and 
the waves are gently lapping the shore. Palm trees are swaying 
in the breeze and the orange sun hangs high as birds fly across 
the cloudless blue sky. I turn my head to watch a sail boat in the 
distance and see my partner smiling at me as we walk hand-in-
hand together.” 
Auditory – “I hear the waves lapping the shore and the distinct 
sound of birds overhead. When I look at my partner, I hear “isn’t 
this perfect?” said to me in a gentle, loving way.” 
Kinaesthetic Physical – “I feel the warmth of the sun on my face 
and body. There is also a very gentle breeze, which has a mildly 
cooling effect. I feel my partner’s hand in mine, and as we walk on 
the soft sand, I feel tiny grains of sand in between my toes.”
Olfactory – “I smell the sea breeze and the faint aroma of my 
partner’s perfume.” 
Gustatory – “I taste the salt air mingled with the delicious drink 
we shared moments ago.” 
Kinaesthetic Emotional – “I experience a sense of love, being 
loved and the freedom to be myself. I feel very happy, fulfilled and 
grateful.”

3.	Read what you have written in step 2 several times so you become 
familiar with it.
4.	In a relaxed state, sit or lie down somewhere comfortable and close 
your eyes; breathe normally and track your breathing for a few 
seconds. 
5.	Now bring up in your mind each of the six elements of your ‘future 
memory’, as listed in step 2. Start with the Visual element first 
and then the others one after the other in whichever order you 
remember. You need only spend a few seconds on each one and the 
whole experience need last no longer than sixty seconds. However, 
you must participate fully as if you are actually there enjoying the 
experience – this is vitally important.
Some guidelines that will help you:
Visual – Make the picture life-size, panoramic, colourful, bright 
and in focus.
Kinaesthetic Physical – Once you get used to doing this exercise, 
you may actually mimic the physical actions, e.g., for the walk on 
the beach, you can stand up and pretend to walk with your partner, 
etc. 
Kinaesthetic Emotional – You must participate with emotional 
intensity. So really feel the emotions you are going through and 
make this truly compelling. 
Make sure you experience the other senses intensely too.
Repeat this exercise as often as you can, preferably twice a day every 
day for a minimum of 21 days without fail. An optimal time to do it is 
just before you go to sleep at night. You can enhance or re-design your 
‘future memory’ at any time, and indeed condition additional ‘future 
memories’ into your unconscious mind, as long as they all support the 
same outcome and do not contradict each other in any way. 
Because this is a closed-eye process, I am duty bound to state that you 
must not do this exercise whilst operating any equipment, driving a 
vehicle or performing any other activity that may place you or other 
persons in any danger. 
Visualisation as a tool in performance psychology has been around for 
decades; however, this approach of using all of your senses takes it to 

579
SECOND TIME AROUND: ATTRACTING YOUR IDEAL PARTNER
another level. It is based on psychological studies and is designed to 
activate the right filters in your mind to bring about the right situations 
for you to attract your ideal partner. Once these situations come your 
way, it is up to you to take the next steps. A great coach will help you 
to identify and implement those next steps; and it is of the utmost 
importance that you choose that type of professional very wisely. 
Good luck!

NEVER GIVE UP
CHAPTER 65
NEVER GIVE UP
BY STEVE RENNER
If you would have told me in my younger years where my life would 
lead me in the future, I’m sure I wouldn’t have believed you. I never had 
any formal education after high school. I did however have a musical 
talent when I was younger, and spent a lot of time playing in musical 
groups traveling around the country. That’s how I made my living until 
I got older and decided that wasn’t the type of life I wanted. I eventually 
found my niche in the real world as a painter. But to go from musician/
painter to Internet business expert would require a tremendous amount 
of growth and transformation. 
My painting years were at the onset of the Internet. Discussion about 
this new virtual phenomenon called the Internet was just beginning and 
it fascinated me. Even though I lacked a formal college education, I was 
always thinking and learning and I was especially intrigued by this new 
discovery. I remember sitting at a coffee shop reading an article about 
companies trying to figure out how to make money on the Internet. At 
that time, no one had yet started making money on it. That’s when the 
wheels began turning and ideas began flowing. Even though I knew 
very little at that time, I knew enough to know that the Internet was 
something I wanted to learn more about and I was sure there would 
eventually be a way to make money with it. I thought if I could become 
a service provider that would be the way to go because I could have 
customers and monthly income from those customers based on the 

TRANSFORM
582
services I provided. However, at the time I didn’t even have a computer. 
I would go to the library to use the computers provided to the public 
and Internet connection was so slow it would sometimes take several 
minutes for a page to load. 
Because of how expensive computers were at that time, they were 
unaffordable for me. However, I was able to barter with someone to 
do some work for them in exchange for a computer they owned. So, in 
1996, with my bartered computer, I began an aggressive campaign to 
teach myself everything I could learn about the operation of the Internet. 
But my love interest with the Internet would be put on hold when, in 
1997, I was involved in a construction accident and fell from the third 
floor of a building when the ladder collapsed. I broke my back and 
shattered my ankles among other injuries. The doctors weren’t sure if I 
would ever walk again. I spent a month in the hospital and another year 
in rehab in a wheelchair. During my recovery time at home, I would go 
to the computer whenever I was physically able and taught myself how 
to do web design and everything I could about the Internet. As I got 
physically stronger and got back up on my feet, I kept moving toward 
my dream of starting an Internet business and actually formed my first 
Internet service company in 1998.
The day I started the business, I was online promoting it through email 
and word began to spread. I didn’t know how to sell anything on the 
Internet at that time, so I was giving away the service at no charge. I 
gave away free websites, offered a free website builder, and free email. 
In 1998 email was a big deal because there were only a few email 
providers. At that time it was exciting just to get an email. (Unlike today 
when most people wish they could stop getting so many emails.) 
I then connected with a company I heard about who was providing free 
Internet access. So, I added that service to my portfolio and was offering 
all the services I mentioned above plus free Internet access. Since I was 
giving everything away, I decided to call my company Ezze.net. Back 
then .net was indicative of a service provider. 
I think the smartest thing I did at that time was to develop a program 
enabling me to track all the people who signed up for the Internet related 
services I was providing. I remember sitting in the living room in my 

583
NEVER GIVE UP
wheel chair. Whenever an email came in, I was alerted by a distinct 
chime. I had the program set up to notify me whenever anyone signed 
up for services through my company. I heard the chime and went to my 
computer to look at the message. Someone had signed up for Ezze.net. 
I remember looking at my wife and saying, “Look at that! Someone 
signed up!” That was an exciting time! Then, a little while later I heard 
another chime. Sure enough, another sign up occurred. Then the chimes 
kept rolling; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 15,000 people signed up in 
the first 2 weeks. An unbelievable start! 
I began emailing and tracking our members and eventually figured a 
way to monetize it so I could begin making money from the business. In 
2000 I began an affiliate program giving people the opportunity to earn 
money by reselling the service. I sent a check to one of our affiliates in 
New Zealand for $30 and it took about 3 weeks for him to receive it and 
for the check to clear; and he lost about 30% in the currency exchange. I 
thought, “There has to be a better way than this.” That’s when I came up 
with the idea to pay people on a debit card. I actually got the idea from 
another company who had attempted something similar. 
As I became more involved in payment processing, the company 
actually evolved into a provider of affiliate payment services as our core 
business. This was before PayPal. We kind of pioneered the affiliate 
payment service and for quite a while we were the leading provider in 
that niche. The name of that company was Cash Cards International. 
So, the company evolved from Ezze.net to Cash Cards International and 
became the number one provider of online affiliate payments through 
debit cards. With over 100,000 participants, that became my core 
business for about 6 years. 
Eventually, many other companies began to enter that space and PayPal 
became a dominant player in that industry. While exploring new 
directions for my company, I began attending various Internet seminars. 
I saw people making presentations and selling their courses about how 
to make money on the Internet. I knew the presenters actually never 
made anything close to what I had made on the Internet. It caused me 
to think, “If these guys can do this, so can I.” That experience caused 
me to realize there was a market where people were willing to pay for 
someone to teach them how to market their business on the Internet. 

TRANSFORM
584
I started an affiliate training program, but quickly realized I was 
teaching them much more than that. I was teaching them how to make 
money on the Internet. So we became an Internet marketing training 
company. People would attend the online seminars for free, and would 
then pay to come to my office and I would show them firsthand how to 
make money on the Internet. That’s when I started Millionaire Internet 
Training (MIT) seminars. 
After doing those trainings for a while, I realized if people were going to 
market on the Internet, they were going to need things such as domains, 
hosting, shopping cart service, mailing list service, payment services, 
etc. Since I already provided all of that through Ezze.net and Cash 
Cards, I already had everything in place. So, it was quite easy to put it 
all together. The only missing ingredient was traffic. So I came up with 
an idea to provide traffic for people and created a traffic platform where 
I did a revenue-share with people that view and rate ads. So, through 
our platform, people could sit at home and view and rate ads and earn 
rewards. Advertisers can actually earn money to help offset the cost of 
their own ads plus earn credits to advertise more. It was a revolutionary 
concept. 
Adding this new traffic platform really completed the business. Then I 
decided to put all the services under one roof and called it InetGlobal 
because we had become a truly global Internet services provider. That 
business took off like you wouldn’t believe. It was like lightning struck 
for the third time. We quickly expanded to a couple hundred thousand 
members and it’s been growing ever since. 
Previously it took me 10 years to do $100 million in online sales. But in 
2012 the company did roughly $100 million in online sales in one year 
alone. In 2013 the company sales tripled that and we did roughly $300 
million in online sales. In 2014 we are on track to do $1 billion in online 
sales. We have members in 120 countries, we are in the top 300 highest 
traffic websites in the world, and we are on the brink of becoming one 
of the biggest Internet companies in the world. 
However, all of this didn’t come easy. There have been definite setbacks 
along the way. In 2009 I had a dispute with the government regarding 
the accuracy of my tax returns. Despite the best efforts of my attorneys, 
I went to court and lost. As a result, in 2010 I spent a year in jail. My 

585
NEVER GIVE UP
attorneys and I still believe my tax return was correct and I was not 
evading taxes as I was accused. Unfortunately, it all comes down to 
who has the better representation in court. The government has really 
great attorneys and got the upper hand on my legal team, and the IRS 
ultimately won the day in court. 
The great tragedy is that I never did anything wrong. I’ve paid millions 
of dollars in taxes over the years. Unfortunately, the stigma associated 
with that court ruling is a situation with which I now have to live. I 
could have become bitter and stayed down after I lost in court, but I 
didn’t. In spite of having to deal with that tragedy and set back, I now 
have one of the most successful Internet companies in the world simply 
because I refused to give up. 
2010 actually was the year of the double whammy. That same year 
the government suspected my company might be running some kind 
of Ponzi scheme. At that time, there seemed to be a rash of Ponzi 
scheme investigations. Ponzi schemes seemed to be running rampant 
with several high profile cases in the news. The US President actually 
commissioned a special task force in every major city in America with 
the task of weeding out corruption surrounding Ponzi schemes. For 
some unknown reason, the government looked at us and decided we 
looked like a Ponzi scheme. They raided our company offices, took all 
our books and records, and took $25 million of our money without any 
charges, just a suspicion.
That was another time I could have thrown in the towel and given up. But 
I didn’t give up because I knew I was right and we weren’t doing anything 
illegal. We fought the government and fought them hard. We kept the 
business going even though it was on life support for a while. After two 
and a half years of investigation, an order came down from a Federal 
Judge that ended the investigation and they gave us back all of our money. 
It was the first time in history that any of our attorneys could ever recall 
that a company had their money seized and then had it returned to them. It 
just validated what we are doing and made us stronger than ever. We went 
from that setback in 2010, barely surviving because of the government 
investigation, to a magnificent comeback in just 3 years. 
Beginning the rebuilding process in 2011, I was able to turn the company 
around to become one of the most successful Internet companies in the 

TRANSFORM
586
world. We went from barely surviving in 2010 to being a leader in the 
industry in just 3 years, and it’s all because I refused to give up. Those 
circumstances would have defeated many people, but I was unwilling to 
let that happen, and I Never Give Up. 
Below are eight very specific keys to what has transformed me from a 
painter to a successful international Internet expert and executive. They 
are simple points, but powerful: 
1) Have a Dream – My dream began at a coffee shop when I read an 
article about people trying to understand how they can make money 
on the Internet. My Dream was to start my own successful Internet 
service company. With hard work I turned that dream into a reality. 
If you have a dream, why not dream big. You can make your dreams 
come true.
2) Believe in Yourself – I am convinced you can accomplish anything 
you want in this world as long as you believe it and you don’t give 
up on your dreams. Believe in yourself and you can achieve your 
dreams.
3) Surround Yourself with the Right People – I surround myself with 
really smart people and I have some of the smartest people in the 
world working with me. We have an incredible executive team and 
we employ over 100 people in the US and another 50 people offshore 
doing contract work for us. They are key to my company’s success. 
4) Be Laser Focused – You start with a vision and set your goals. You 
can make it happen if you get focused with laser precision. If it’s 
something you’re passionate about, you can do things you didn’t 
think you were capable of doing. Create your plan, work the plan, 
and don’t be distracted by circumstances or negative people, and just 
focus like a laser beam on your goals.
5) The Attraction Factor – There is something special that happens to 
focused people that I can’t explain. They attract the right things and 
the right people. You may be surprised when the right people come 
into your life at the right time. It has happened over and over again 
in my life. No matter what I’ve gone through. When the time is right, 
the right person is going to walk through the door to help you do what 
you need to do. It’s amazing. It has happened to me so many times 

587
NEVER GIVE UP
I’ve come to expect it. It’s not a magical or big surprise anymore, it’s 
just that real. 
6) Work Hard – No matter what, there’s no free lunch. You have to put 
the work in. If you don’t take action, it’s not going to happen. The 
most successful people that I know are people that aren’t afraid to 
work hard and take action. 
7) It’s Not All About the Money – It’s not all about the money; it’s more 
about making a difference in people’s lives. My company started and 
funds the Acesse Foundation, a professionally managed non-profit 
organization that helps various people in need. Helping others and 
giving something back is what really matters in this life. 
8) Never Give Up – You can accomplish anything you want in this life, 
as long as you believe, and never give up on your dreams. And if you 
get knocked down, just get back up on your feet and keep fighting… 
and Never Give Up.

Steve Renner, a pioneer on the Internet, started his first Internet 
Service Company in 1998. From his humble beginnings, Steve 
has built one of the most successful Internet Companies in the 
world, through sheer determination, and a “Never Give Up” 
attitude, against all odds. 
Steve’s company Acesse provides affordable Web and Mobile services for Small 
Business. By focusing on Small Business, Acesse has become the champion of the

Success hasn’t come easy for Steve, as he has had more than his share of adversity. 
In 2009 Steve had a dispute with the IRS, and went to court to stand up for what 
he believed to be right. Rather than plead guilty, Steve chose to fight. He ended up 
spending a year in jail, rather than admit to something he was innocent of.
On top of this, the US Government raided Steve’s business, claiming to suspect him of 
running a Ponzi Scheme. They seized all his books and records, and over $25 Million 
dollars. After 2½ years of exhaustive investigation, the Government could find “No 
Wrong Doing.” No charges were ever filed and the investigation was officially ended 
by order of a Federal Judge. The Government returned the entire $25 Million. 
For most people, this type of devastating blow would have put them under, but not 
Steve. His “Never Give Up” attitude has brought him back from the brink of failure to 
become one most successful people in the world today. 
Steve is living proof that you can achieve your dreams, as long as you believe in 
yourself, and Never Give Up!
Steve adds, “And yes, I do pay an incredible amount of Taxes!” 
As Steve says, “It’s not just about making money, it about making a difference in peoples 
lives.” This is why Steve created the Acesse Foundation. The Acesse Foundation is a 
professionally managed non-profit organization that will fund worthwhile charitable 
causes; that includes providing food and health care for underprivileged children, 
an educational Scholarship Fund, to help talented Technology students, and aid for 
individuals who were wrongfully convicted. Steve’s Company Acesse will donate 5% 
of its Pre-Tax profits annually to the Acesse Foundation.

DON’T F.A.I.L! UPGRADE YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM
CHAPTER 66
DON’T F.A.I.L!  UPGRADE 
YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM
BY PAUL MANTELLO
– WHAT WILL YOUR TRANSFORMATION LOOK LIKE?
– HOW WILL YOU KNOW THAT IT HAS BEGUN?
Transformations begin with the journey of life and are affected by the 
level of one’s awareness, desire, passion, commitment, knowledge 
and discipline; however, everyone’s journey is unique and that’s what 
allows them to reach their own transformations. Some of the most 
powerful transformations occur after experiencing a very painful event 
or a series of painful events. Events so powerful, that they will force you 
to challenge everything that you once believed to be true. Allow me to 
show you a better way, one that will allow you to gain control.
My journey of transformation was no different than most, it was one that 
was filled with many challenges and heartache. I had many challenges 
that tested me at every twist and turn of my journey, each providing a 
lesson that I needed to learn, in order to advance to the next stage of my 
life. On many occasions, I faced numerous difficulties that would cause 
me to consider giving up and walking away from my dreams. It was 
definitely not easy to stay on course, especially when nothing seemed 
to go right. My challenges became tougher and more painful each time 
that I did not learn the intended lessons. 
I was definitely not aware of this; until my most powerful lesson had 
almost become my last.  

TRANSFORM
592
There I was just sitting in my car, stopped in traffic on the highway, 
feeling frustrated and angry about the lack of progress that I was making 
in life. It just wasn’t working out the way that I had planned, it was all 
taking too long. As I looked up and glanced at my rear view mirror; 
that’s when I saw it, and within seconds, it happened. Bam! My car 
was struck from behind by an SUV that was traveling at over 75 mph. I 
remember thinking to myself; in those few seconds before impact that: I 
would never see my wife and my son again and how I would never even 
have a chance to meet my unborn child, who was due to arrive in less 
than 8 weeks. When I regained consciousness, I remembered making a 
promise to God; that if I would be lucky enough to have another chance: 
that I would live life to my fullest, love everyone with my all, and that 
I would help others understand what I had discovered from my journey, 
awakening and transformation. 
ARE YOU READY TO DISCOVER A BETTER WAY  
OF CREATING YOUR TRANSFORMATION? 
Great, let’s begin.
In order to control and create the transformation that you desire, you 
must first understand how your mind operates and then you must 
learn how to upgrade it. This is the secret that has led to all of the 
success stories that you have ever heard about: including Thomas 
Edison, Andrew Carnegie, Abraham Lincoln, Steve Jobs, etc. They all 
discovered what I am about to share with you and that is: that we are all 
born as creators. Our Creator has given us the ability to create anything 
that we desire, and it all begins with a simple thought, followed by an 
action which is sealed by faith. Once you understand this, you will be 
able to create anything that you desire. You have done this from the very 
moment that you were created. Your first creation was in the form of the 
changes that you caused your mother to experience in her pregnancy. 
You created new emotions along with physical changes in her and you 
also created emotional changes in everyone that you would soon know, 
as family. You have always been more powerful than you could have 
ever imagined; even before you could have given it any thought. You 
have been, are and always will be a creator.
Wow; so if it’s that easy: what happened?  
Why isn’t my life perfect?

593
DON’T F.A.I.L! UPGRADE YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM
That’s where the programming or operating system comes in; we’ve 
all been programmed to operate on what I call the F.A.I.L. Operating 
System. Although we all operate on this same exact OS, we have not 
all operated under the same exact environmental conditions, nor are we 
identical and that’s why we all experience different results. We all have 
our own special gifts; which make us who we are. 
As a creator, you have the ability to update your operating system and 
create one that will serve you. 
WHERE DID YOUR OS COME FROM?
Everyone is born knowing the same exact things and everything else is 
additional programing. You are born knowing the basics for survival; 
breathing occurs just as naturally as your heart pumps on its own, 
without you giving it a thought.
Your programming has been developed and is still affected by those 
whom you have been and still are surrounded by. Although you were 
born without the F.A.I.L. OS; it was subtly programmed into you. You 
unknowingly made updates whenever you challenged certain things, 
while just accepting others; simply because you didn’t know better. 
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
It is just a part of life that is handed down from one generation to the 
next, simply by default. Think about it, where did you learn about the 
basics of life? Most, if not all of us; have learned these things from the 
people who have helped raise us and they too learned the same way: 
from their programmers (parents, teachers, society, etc.). The problem is 
that while you were young, your programming was vulnerable and not 
operating at its fullest, you only knew basic survival skills. So, you took 
most of what you learned without questioning it because you trusted 
your teachers and simply didn’t know any better.
As you grew older and wiser, you began to challenge some of the 
programming, but as life began to take its toll on you, you may have 
decided that it would be easier to step aside and allow your life to be 
dictated by the “mind hackers”(outside forces that infiltrate your OS). 
But those who challenged their F.A.I.L. OS are the ones that broke free 
and regained their creator status. This is the secret that has allowed 
them to reach their ultimate success. Success has many different 

TRANSFORM
594
meanings, and only you can determine what it means to you – money, 
love, purpose, fame, etc.
UNDERSTANDING AND UPDATING THE F.A.I.L. OS
So, what is the F.A.I.L. Operating System? The F.A.I.L. OS is a 
program that is made up of Fears, Assumptions, Interpretations and 
Limiting beliefs.
Fear only has the power that you allow it to have. Fear is just a simple 
four-letter word, but yet it can cripple anyone in an instant. 
Let’s assume that fear makes up only 5% of who you are; that means 
that you are allowing 5% (fear) of you to take over and control the other 
95%, when you are operating out of fear. What would happen if you could 
control your fear and use that 5% of energy towards being who you are? 
Think about that for a moment… how powerful will you become when 
you learn to harness this 5% of energy that is being used to hold you down 
and cripple you? Think about that, only 5% is holding back the other 95% 
of you. This is why it is vital for you to take control of your fears; you must 
do this in order to live a truly happy, successful and completely joyful life. 
Fear is the avoidance of pain; which is created in your mind as a safety 
mechanism – to prevent or avoid painful experiences. These are either 
painful experiences that you’ve already lived through, or those of which 
you have seen or heard of another experiencing.
Here’s a tip: Keep challenging your fears and never back down – the 
more that you challenge them, the more in control you will become. 
You decide whether your FEARS grow or shrink. Control your fears by 
constantly questioning and challenging them. I know that you can do 
this; I believe in you and now you must believe in yourself.
Assumptions are things that you believe to be true, based on your past 
experience or knowledge of someone else’s experience. This can cause 
problems by creating a tunnel-vision effect – meaning that you have 
already decided on an outcome based on your prior experiences or 
knowledge; so therefore, you will only see what you want to see. Once 
you can learn to control your assumptions, you will begin to see more 
opportunities. To control your assumptions; you must first know when 
you’re making one, then question it and see it for what it is and not what 
you think it is.

DON’T F.A.I.L! UPGRADE YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM
Interpretations are the meanings that you give to something that 
someone has said or done. You feel that there is a motive behind the 
other person’s action(s). In other words, you create interpretations about 
people, situations and experiences based upon what you believe to be 
true. The way that you interpret something is determined by the way 
that you perceive the world and everything in it. It is important to realize 
that most interpretations are being made automatically, based on past 
events, which are stored in your mind. You decide what interpretation 
to give something based upon past events that have occurred in your 
life, which is why you automatically respond without a second thought. 
Interpretations are easily skewed by feelings that are connected to the 
subject at hand.
Limiting beliefs are things that you believe to be true and therefore limit 
you in some way. These beliefs shape the way that you see the world, 
other people and yourself. Limiting beliefs are a big part of why you 
will not attempt certain things – which leads to that feeling of being 
stuck. It’s these Limiting Beliefs that holds you back from achieving 
more in life.
What does a limiting belief sound like and how could it be so powerful? 
“I DON’T HAVE A DEGREE; THEREFORE  
I’M NOT SMART ENOUGH TO…”  
This is a strong limiting belief; one that will affect you for as long as you 
believe it to be true. Therefore, you will never allow yourself to go after 
what you want because of a limit that you have placed upon yourself. 
Remember, that as a creator you will manifest whatever you think about 
the most, so why concentrate on what you believe is a limitation, when 
you could just as easily concentrate on and manifest being limitless?
WHO IS YOUR MOST POWERFUL ENEMY  
AND HOW CAN YOU FIND THEM? 
This may be a tough answer to swallow, but an easy one to answer and it 
involves a top-secret tool. Are you sure that you are ready for this? If so, 
I want you to find a mirror (top secret tool) and take a good hard look at 
the person starring right back at you, that’s your most powerful enemy. 
No one can do more harm to you than you can do to yourself. But the 
opposite is also true and can be achieved by learning to love yourself 

TRANSFORM
596
and not being so hard on yourself. How many friends would you have if 
you treated them as badly as you treat yourself?  Give yourself a break. 
My journey has been dictated by my passion to help others, and my 
transformation has led me to the creation of the F.A.I.L. OS which has 
allowed me to help shape the lives and success of others, as well as 
myself. Once you learn the proper techniques and begin to update your 
F.A.I.L. OS, you too will begin to unlock your true potential. In order to 
correct or change something, you must first know what that something 
is, and secondly you must know how it operates before you can devise 
a successful plan of action. You have been operating under this OS your 
entire life and therefore cannot expect instant changes. However, now 
that you have the formula and understanding of how your OS works, 
you too can begin a successful transformation. This is a life changing 
process that you must follow and be committed to. Just as with anything 
else in life, you will get from this what you put into it. I have put all of 
these pieces together so that you too can experience the transformation 
of your dreams. Now that you know and understand your operating 
system, you should constantly challenge and reprogram any parts of the 
F.A.I.L.’s that no longer serve you. 
Successful transformations occur for those who are motivated, 
passionate and always searching for ways to improve their skills 
effectively –  because they understand that time is not only money, 
but also the most precious and limited commodity that any of us have. 
That’s why all successful individuals hire the best people when building 
their team(s), from coaches, attorneys and accountants to consultants. 
They understand that becoming the best requires dedication, discipline, 
training, learning, implementation and positive constructive feedback in 
order to shorten the learning curve, and to achieve the best results with 
the least amount of pain. You can see this from professional athletes 
to very successful entrepreneurs and executives. They understand the 
importance of having help and that’s why they all have a coach on their 
team of experts. Do you have a team or are you still waiting for that one 
big lesson that could possibly become your last? No one ever said that 
you couldn’t ask for help; seek and you shall find.
It’s your turn to Live to your Fullest, go out and Create your Own 
Life, as all Creators do.

DEMAND
CHAPTER 67
DEMAND
BY TRAVIS LANAGHAN
My father instilled the thought into me at a very young age, “Travis, 
you will be great at everything you ever do.” This is what he would tell 
me, constantly, up to the point where I believed it. Still, to this day, I 
trust that I am the best man for the job. This mindset procured from my 
father’s wise words have evolved into something more; something that 
has changed my life and still to this day changes my life. I am here today 
writing this chapter about how to transform you and your WORK habits 
to best serve you, all the while teaching you how to become a valued 
asset, rather than just a number on a payroll sheet. 
My past has proven to me, as I am sure many of you are aware, that our 
JOBS for the most part, will continue with or without us. This aspect 
is terrifying in its own sense, as this simple idea can hinder us from 
unlocking our full potential. I have heard over and over again, “You are 
expendable, why are you trying so hard?” “All of you, (your positions 
here), you are a dime a dozen, we don’t need you.” These negative 
connotations are designed to keep you depressed and thinking, “I’m 
a nobody.” I am here to tell you that you are not replaceable, you are 
unique, and your skills are in high demand. All that you need is the 
right mindset, the correct mentality. Then I can promise you, the people 
saying you are expendable are ultimately looking at your success, and 
knowing that they are the ones that are truly replaceable.
Let’s begin with the simple word “Work.” What does work mean 
exactly? If we take a look at the definition according to Webster’s 

TRANSFORM
600
dictionary, it’s “a job or activity that you do regularly especially in order 
to earn money.” Based on that definition, work sounds like a job. Let’s 
try another definition, “Activity in which one exerts strength or faculties 
to do or perform something.” Again these definitions are cold and 
objective. In my earlier years, I always associated the word “work” as 
something I didn’t want to do because of those very definitions. “Work” 
is hard, boring, and takes up all of our time. And let’s face it, we all can 
find something better to do than “work.”  
Many people have a belief that they don’t have the opportunities that 
others have, making up excuses as to why or why not. These negative 
beliefs will harbor resentment towards others’ success and hinder one 
from being truly successful. We all have the choice to become whoever 
we want to be, but it all begins with your mindset.
Are you ready?
In this Chapter, I want to delve into exactly what “work” means, how 
our work affects us personally, as well as the people around us. How can 
it formulate who you are as a spouse, a father, a mother, and a friend? 
There are three distinct types of people-traits: DEMAND, MOTION, 
and MANAGE. People with MOTION traits tend to go with the flow, 
they aren’t your typical leaders; they are happy going through the 
motions and would rather be told what to do rather than figuring it out 
themselves. People with MANAGE traits tend to be very organized, and 
find it difficult to think outside the box. They manage their mind, their 
goals, and only do what is needed to finish the task with minimal effort. 
Throughout this chapter we are going to break down and learn the six key 
attributes of the DEMAND personality that are necessary for becoming 
successful in the work place. There is nothing wrong with any of these 
types of people, but whether you know it or not, your work habits are 
what make you the person you are today. These habits can stop you from 
becoming something bigger than yourself. While we may point fingers 
and place blame on others for our own shortcomings, in reality, it is our 
own work beliefs that can hold us down. 
Many of us wake up earlier then we would prefer, travel somewhere, 
and proceed to trade our time for money. This is known to most as a job, 
like the definition of work. For every day of every week, we know that 
regardless of our efforts, the wheels and gears will continue to turn even 

601
DEMAND
when we are not around. Or so society has taught us.  This is true in most 
jobs, whether you work at home or for yourself. If you stop working, the 
money stops. Knowing that our lives, for the most part, revolve around 
our JOB, how can we use work to better ourselves, to build that drive, 
to make us into the most valuable asset we can be?  
Growing up, I played a lot of sports and was very active within my 
community. My parents made a deal with me. As long as I stayed active 
with extra-curricular activities and my grades in school stayed up, I 
wouldn’t have to get a job.  Now this sounded like a pretty sweet deal, 
until I started driving. Soon I found a girl who I wanted to impress, so 
I needed a job. Mom and Dad weren’t going to fork out cash for their 
son to spend on sweet nothings. If I wanted to take my girlfriend/future 
wife out, I needed a job. I got my first job at a local hardware store. 
They weren’t hiring, but I applied anyways. They told me they would 
get back to me. Well, that wasn’t good enough; I needed money, and 
didn’t really wish to flip burgers at the fast food joint. So the next day I 
returned, and the next day and the next, until finally after over a week of 
this, I earned a position on the team.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, I 
had just learned the first lesson of a DEMAND-type personality. 
Dedicated
I was dedicated enough to keep going back, day after day, showing up 
the same time every day, talking to the same people every day, letting 
them know I was serious and I wanted to work for them. When you 
become dedicated to an idea, a thought, a position, nothing should hold 
you back. People may ridicule you and tell you to stop wasting your 
time, but no matter how insignificant an idea or goal, if you are dedicated 
to seeing it through not much can truly stop you. Dedication isn’t just 
showing up every day, it’s showing up with purpose, goals, and energy.
Energetic
Coming to work every day seemed to be an exciting new challenge, am 
I going to help someone fix their leaky sink or sell three chainsaws? 
Will I have the opportunity to leave the store and install some new locks 
on a home? Either way, I was consistently setting personal goals. How 
can I outperform myself? What can I do better than I did yesterday? 
Having energy every day when coming to work is the key to success. 
Instead of looking at tasks as mindless and boring, create challenges 
for yourself, take that  task and make it your own. Find another better 

TRANSFORM
602
way to complete it. Even something that has been done over a thousand 
times can be done better. It just needs your abilities. 
Motivated
Staying motivated is the most difficult mindset to overcome.  When 
your job involves repetitive motions, it is easy to become complacent. 
You show up at the same place, you take your breaks at the same time 
– work life is putting you into a mindless motion movement. It is very 
easy to fall into the MOTION-personality characteristics. The most 
obvious question that comes to mind is, how do you stay motivated? 
How do you stay motivated when you are turning the same wrench or 
flipping the same burger, or typing up the same spread sheet for the 
millionth time?  Where is your mind, why are you turning that wrench 
or typing that spreadsheet?  The answer is found deep inside each of us. 
Is it money, power, or recognition? 
Let’s face it, most of us have or have had bosses who don’t know the first 
thing about motivation, simply because they’re not leaders. In order to 
be motivated, YOU need to motivate, inspire and become that leader. If 
you start shrugging off your responsibility, those around you are sure to 
follow. However, if you are the one who buckles down and encourages 
others to work and perform better, you will find staying motivated isn’t 
as difficult as you once thought.
Anticipate 
Not one person can predict the future, but everyone can prepare for any 
possible outcome. Successful people in the workplace or in life look at 
all possible outcomes they might encounter before moving forth with a 
task or a job. Anticipation means preplanning, having a course of action, 
and having proper contingency plans in place. Anticipating all aspects 
beforehand leaves little room for unnecessary stress and hardships; they 
can save you or someone else a great deal of time and money. These 
events more than likely won’t happen, but you will be comforted to 
know that you had taken the time to anticipate such possibilities, so that 
you can focus your time and attention on the important details, and not 
leaving the unknown to chance.  It is truly freeing to have anticipated 
and planned for a problem that arises and handle it without hesitation.

603
DEMAND
Nobility
The state of being noble in character, quality, honor, and integrity. 
Character defines who we are as a person; quality defines how much 
we believe in what do. Believing in what we do in our day-to-day work 
life comes down to what we do when people are not watching. How 
we manage situations and stand true to what is expected of us when the 
camera isn’t looking is a sign of true nobility. 
We must believe in honor and integrity to do the right thing regardless 
of the outcome. Make no mistake; we all fall short of these noble ideals. 
Your mistakes will be used as ammunition against you. Women and men 
of nobility believe in acceptance and responsibility, not only for their 
actions, but also for the actions taking place under their watch; these 
acts of humility and forgiveness are signs of true nobility. 
Determination
The last of the DEMAND characteristics is determination. This can 
come in all shapes and sizes. Being truly and fully determined to seeing 
a project through or a job finished is probably the single most important 
attribute in the Demand category. Determination isn’t something that 
naturally occurs for most, it’s built up over time. Only when we fail can 
we truly become determined to succeed. Failure is key to the success 
of the determined; many say, “fail your way to success.” That saying 
couldn’t be truer for the determined. Always strive to be better, always 
put in that extra time, the extra effort, the extra nobility and humility. 
The rewards won’t always be easy to spot. Perhaps there won’t be any 
rewards; therein lies the fallacy. The reward doesn’t come from someone 
else, the reward lies solely inside. Recognition for an achievement is 
nice, but if you DEMAND it of yourself, if you strive for the best, there 
was something you could have done better, there will always be room 
from improvement. Be determined to get better every day of every week 
of every year.
These six Demand characteristics aren’t just quick tips for climbing the 
corporate ladder, but rather life lessons that can be put to use in every 
aspect of your every day. When you start applying these attributes to 
your lifestyle, you will notice a change, perhaps a beginning to your true 
purpose, but you will never know until you start to DEMAND more of 
yourself everyday without hesitation.

TRANSFORMING TO A QUINTESSENTIAL LIFE
CHAPTER 68
TRANSFORMING TO A 
QUINTESSENTIAL LIFE
BY TRISH McCARTY
Quintessential: The fifth and highest element in ancient philosophy 
that permeates all nature and is the substance composing the celestial 
bodies; the essence of a thing in its purest and most concentrated form. 
~ Merriam-Webster
You are a success. You’ve made it. You are reading this book, always 
improving. You are financially strong, popular, probably own your 
own business, you have friends, you go on great trips, you might be 
considered religious, you are where you want to be…according to what 
others think and say about you. You are in the top 2% of the world’s 
most influential. You know there is more, not only to give, but to feel. 
You have had amazing experiences and you have met amazing people 
and yet something else seems to be calling you. When you go to bed 
at night; when you wake up in the middle of the night or in the early 
morning, something or some things feel unresolved or perhaps are 
calling you.
God has tethered you to your highest calling and until you reach it, 
you will be wandering and wondering. And it is not defined by others, 
maybe not even by you. Since the day you were very, young, you have 
been told; and even told yourself, “You have so much potential.” …
Potential for what? …Potential to make money? …Potential to have a 
doctorate degree? …Potential to be a sports leader? …Potential to teach 

TRANSFORM
606
others? …Potential to be a writer or a scientist?
Potential is a glass ceiling, defined by someone or something because 
you have shown a particular talent or tendency to do well, and you 
have achieved that talent, that potential. But what is trying to cause 
a transformation toward your highest calling is so deep inside of you, 
trying so quietly to get your attention, and yet covered by so much noise? 
It becomes persistent throughout the years, as a constant, muddled, 
unresolved stirring, deep inside of you, wanting you to realize.
I help kids to transform. Kindergarten through twelfth grade kids begin to 
look for their “highest calling” as they grow, beginning in Kindergarten. 
And they learn that life changes constantly to call you time and time 
again to be more, to do more and to calm down and trust more. We don’t 
talk about the student’s potential; we discuss their dreams and find out 
what they love. 
I formed StarShine Academy International Charter Schools in 2002, 
pushed by the disasters of 9/11, the Columbine Shootings and observing 
schools teaching kids everything BUT how to become transformational 
leaders and thinkers. I have been involved in transformational 
leadership, even as a young child, growing up in Tokyo, I was honored 
to serve as a child delegate to the Children’s United Nations meetings 
in Tokyo, Japan. Later, working for AT&T, I watched and participated 
in transformational leadership effecting world change. While working 
for AT&T, developing my career, I became deeply interested in studying 
religion, yoga and how the brain works. In my early twenties, I began 
to teach yoga and to teach executives how to become transformational 
leaders at the time, two very different subjects. I also gave birth to a 
daughter with Autism, further driving my thirst for understanding 
more about the brain. They talked about her having less “potential.” I 
learned that having Autism brings about some extraordinary attributes 
and possibilities rather than the “disabilities.” In my thirties, I began a 
banking career with Mellon Bank, a part of the World Bank. I learned 
how one person could cause a world of difference to happen.
I am in another “calling” now in my life and that is to help to influence 
the world’s most influential women, and the men who support them. 
Women have an extraordinary ability to bring continuity and flow back 
into their communities, families, businesses, cities and countries. At no 

607
TRANSFORMING TO A QUINTESSENTIAL LIFE
time in history have women been this connected, and this powerful. 
My priorities are to help women to connect at the highest levels, and 
support and use those connections as a means to discover their ultimate 
collective influential power, while connecting back to their own inner 
wisdom, love and peace. We are witnessing the world transforming, 
right before our eyes, as the top 2% of the most influential women begin 
to work gently on themselves while working in a more collaborative 
way with other women leaders. 
Money has driven most of the decisions and/or outcomes of the world 
we have experienced so far. Money is energy and flows automatically 
when products and decisions are based on doing the most good. Money 
cannot be forced into becoming sustainable. It is a natural outcome of 
doing things right. 
The top influential women leaders of today are driven by passion, love, 
purpose and winning by doing “Right” and making money because of it. 
If we look at the top women influencers on Facebook, the Forbes List or 
LinkedIn, we see similarities. They run companies, they have employees, 
and most of them share their success through speaking, writing books 
and presenting at conferences. Women are perfectly positioned to shift 
world leadership and world business, for the first time in history. 
I was asked to train eight hundred teachers in Liberia a few years ago 
and learned of the ordinary, unlikely, woman named Leymah Gboweeo 
who led a revolution to create peace in a war torn country of a twenty-
year civil war with nothing more than sheer determination. The press 
called her pathetic. A press release describing the documentary, Pray 
The Devil Back to Hell about these few, one hundred women, can be 
found on the Internet and is a remarkable story few people have heard.
Pray the Devil Back to Hell is the extraordinary story of a small band of 
Liberian women who came together in the midst of a bloody civil war, 
took on the violent warlords and corrupt Charles Taylor regime, and 
won a long-awaited peace for their shattered country in 2003.
As the rebel noose tightened upon Monrovia, and peace talks faced 
collapse, the women of Liberia – Christian and Muslims united - formed 
a thin but unshakable white line between the opposing forces, and 
successfully demanded an end to the fighting– armed only with white 
T-shirts and the courage of their convictions.

TRANSFORM
608
In one remarkable scene, the women barricaded the site of stalled peace 
talks in Ghana, and announced they would not move until a deal was 
done. Faced with eviction, they invoked the most powerful weapon in 
their arsenal – threatening to remove their clothes. It worked.
The women of Liberia are living proof that moral courage and non-
violent resistance can succeed, even where the best efforts of traditional 
diplomacy have failed. Their demonstrations culminated in election of 
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first female head of state, and marked a 
new wave of women taking control of their political destiny around the 
world.
This remarkable chapter of world history was on its way to being lost 
forever. The Liberian war and peace movement were largely ignored as 
the international press focused on Iraq. 
There are three main points to discuss as I look at how women leaders 
reach heights far beyond their “potential.”
BELIEF IN SELF
1. Extraordinary women believe in their abilities and are urged  
by at least one other person, while others do not believe  
they can accomplish the thing they are after. 
Overcoming adversity requires great courage. In my work with the 
most outstanding women, I have yet to meet anyone who has not had 
to overcome obstacles that others looked at as “impossible.” Even at 
very young ages, some of their stories have propelled extraordinary 
women to have the strength to go beyond what others would even think 
possible at all. This “sisterhood” of women determined to stay focused 
and positive – in spite of all sorts of difficulties – is a common factor. 
What causes super successful women to remain positive? They learn 
how to be positive and they practice it and continue to learn, until they 
automatically demonstrate solutions. Just knowing how to begin to 
practice positive solutions has a transformative effect on being able to 
do it.
I am reminded of a woman I have worked with recently who was in 
a successful career and wanted to become a best-selling author. The 
thing I enjoy most about connecting and working with the top 2% of 

609
TRANSFORMING TO A QUINTESSENTIAL LIFE
women leaders is that they take advice quickly and they stay focused 
and methodical on purpose. I told her to form a small, five-person 
MasterMind Group and gave her specific instructions on who to put 
into the group and how being a part of the group and practicing it in a 
well-defined way would propel everyone’s success. I taught her how 
to get her goal of becoming an author down into her heart, from her 
head, by practicing very specific meditation and breathing techniques. 
She developed her skills, she practiced affirmations and exercises 
without fail, and she connected with others for mutual support…and 
she exceeded her dream.
PASSION AND CARING
2. Global influential women care deeply, not only about the thing(s) 
they want to accomplish; they care deeply about most things.  
They are passionate.
Many quantum physicists today are discovering the truth about energy. 
The Secret and What the Bleep Do We Know!? movies taught us to be 
diligent in our thoughts and words. In What the Bleep… we actually 
witnessed water crystals changing as people spoke various words. 
The emotion behind the words carries the energy, causing the effect. 
Everyday more discoveries are being unveiled to show the mind-heart 
connection in manifesting. 
These top 2% women leaders are opinionated about most things and 
yet are such accomplished learners, they are continually curious and 
ready to listen to other’s ideas and opinions. They have spent their lives 
learning and practicing confidence-building and caring for the right 
reasons.
Ernest Holmes, a thought leader of the 1950’s and founder of the Science 
of Mind Church, said, “Is it any different to say that there is one law 
governing all physical phenomena?”…or to say with Emerson, “There 
is one mind common to all individuals?” The universe is a spiritual 
system. It is a manifestation of Divine Intelligence. Another scientist has 
said that we can think of the universe in the terms of an infinite Thinker 
thinking mathematically, which means that faith acts as a law, and this is 
why prayer can be answered. Dr. Einstein said that space and light curve 
back upon themselves. This means that everything moves in circles. 
Jesus said, ‘Give and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed 

TRANSFORM
610
down, and shaken together, and running over.’ Jesus also said that they 
that take up the sword shall perish by it. It really means that what goes out 
will again return; that the inner action of our minds decides what is going 
to happen to us, for ‘as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.’ Thoughts are 
things that mental states cause to produce definite results. This is why we 
meditate, pray and affirm the presence of good in our lives.
TRUST, CONNECTING AND MENTORS
3. Women in the top 2% of influence understand the power of  
trust and of connecting to others through trust, …toward  
a greater good for all.
When I was a very young girl, my mom gave me many pearls of advice. 
One piece of wisdom was to always make friends with people who don’t 
look like me. She said my life would be a whole lot more interesting. 
And to this day, when I walk into a room full of strangers, to build my 
confidence and pay back my promise to Mom, I will look for someone 
interesting and I walk over to introduce myself. 
My mom told me to make lifelong girlfriends and mentors as they 
would stick with me throughout my life successes and pick me up from 
failures. Learning to unconditionally trust others for advice has propelled 
my success faster. When I am a speaker at conferences, especially in 
a female-dominated audience, I am asked about this idea more than 
others. Women are typically slower to trust others immediately, not 
trusting their own gut reaction, causing delayed success. Compare some 
men to some women. I have been present in several meetings in my life 
when a man has told another man to give a large sum of money to help 
another’s business or charity. Without too many questions, the money 
will be given, without knowing the third person or business very well. 
I can think of only one time when this has happened with women in 
my presence. Perhaps women are too cautious, rather than leading with 
their own gut-feel of intuition, they try to out-think the problem. Using 
spirit-filled intuition will almost always trump thinking too much.
Anyone wanting to create amazing success needs a mentor, paid and/
or unpaid. The ones you pay for, you will probably follow the advice 
of quicker. The ones unpaid usually end up being lifelong friends, but 
sometimes don’t tell you the very thing you need to hear to get you 
to act. The Global Women of Influence Network which I started for

Life is one transformational, magical ride, when you choose to follow it.
Tribute and Thank You to Mom, Ruby Sanders:
As I was writing this chapter, my most influential, spiritual, 
transformational female leader, my best friend and sweet Mom went 
back home to Heaven, where she was from. She taught me so many 
important, meaningful lessons. One I will use my entire life, “Life 
is interesting, sometimes unbearable. Sometimes life is completely 
magical. In every moment, you will become better or bitter. Try really 
hard to keep the ‘I’ out.”
