THE REAPPEARANCE 
OF THE CHRIST AND 
THE MASTERS OF 
WISDOM
by Benjamin Creme
Creme reveals that the Christ, as 
World Teacher for the coming 
age, is already among us, gradually 
emerging into full public recogni-
tion. And further, that this great 
Teacher, known as Maitreya, is the 
one expected by many religions, 
although under different names. 
Along with his group of enlight-
ened spiritual teachers, known as 
the Masters of Wisdom, Maitreya will inspire the most profound 
changes in history, ushering humanity into a new age of sharing and 
justice for all.

WHAT GAVE YOU 
THAT IDEA?
Rediscovering the Development of 
Our Worldviews
by Georges Kassabgi
With this thought-provoking essay 
(2012), we are invited to examine 
the living systems’ fundamentals, 
assumptions, and starting points 
used to firm up worldviews. High-
lighted: No one (individual or 
group) knows everything, plus . . .
Each worldview has value—up to 
a point, plus . . . A multidisciplinary 
study is outlined, plus . . . All frameworks of thought (philosophy, 
religious systems, scientific method) are duly considered.
In the follow-up “Postscripts” (2018), the author expounds on his 
insights with readers, and includes his proposition on war and peace 
(presented in academic setting and published in a military journal). 
His focus on deeper understanding ought to be useful to others 
when addressing other global challenges such as climate change, 
pollution control, human rights, finding common ground and sys-
tems thinking with honesty/humility, and more.
His books are independently reviewed and published online (free) by 
the International Society for Philosophers: isfp.sdf.org/books.html

The Story of Our Time,  
and the Future We’ll Face
by Brian T. Watson
A unique, big-picture assessment 
of the unprecedented forces and 
developments besieging our soci-

interconnected, these forces and 
their dynamics will carry us into 
any number of disasters well before 
2100. We have the knowledge and 
solutions to address our difficulties, 
but for many reasons we will not employ them.
Describing the current interplay of capitalism, politics, technol-
ogy, the Internet, human nature, and other realities, the book is 
unflinching in its sobering conclusions.
