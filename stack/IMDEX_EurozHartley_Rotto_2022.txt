Industry Opportunity: Increasing demand for 
minerals used in clean energy technology
7
• For the world to achieve its net-zero goals, the 
aluminum, copper and nickel industries need to 
double in size by the late 2020s, while lithium and 
cobalt mining would need to increase five-fold
WOOD MACKENZIE
• Clean energy needs will escalate the demand for 
rare earth minerals by nearly 500% by 2050
Data as of Jan. 24, 2022
Financing raised by junior and intermediate mining companies
Historical lithium prices refer to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence assessment, min 99.2% Li2C03; historical cobalt prices refer to the London Metal Exchange cobalt cash price for min 99.8% Co. 
Sources: S&P Global Market Intelligence; Benchmark Mineral Intelligence; London Metal Exchange
Lithium financing up 256.7% YOY in 2021

“We are the first generation 
to feel the effect of climate 
change and the last 
generation who can do 
something about it.”
PRESIDENT OBAMA 2014
A plan is not a guarantee. A timely 
transition to a net-zero future is no sure 
thing. But though I may be less 
optimistic than some, consider me 
hopeful – and impatient. 
With the right tools and technology, 
with precision-honed policies, and 
most of all with science on our side, we 
still have a fighting chance.

Each Industry 4.0 solution has an AI + IoT platform 
at its core, but multiple technologies are needed 
for it to succeed
11
• Intelligent, autonomous systems can leverage  
complex data sets and machine learning to 
deliver  AI-driven enhancements in real-time
• The technology exists and is available throughout  
the mining value chain – to date the focus has  
been on equipment and infrastructure 
performance
• By 2035 autonomous mining using data analysis 
and technologies like AI will save the mining 
sector between US$290bn - US$390bn annually*

• Improve the blast design to achieve consistent 
fragmentation of blasted ground and manage 
dust, vibration, fumes and heave
• Visualise geotechnical features and 
reduce uncertainty
• Improve resolution when identifying 
ore boundaries, reactive ground or 
material domains
• Optimise mining practices to improve 
ESG performance (reduced emissions 
and fumes, improved waste 
management practices
• Improve resource stewardship by 
improved decision making in processing, 
waste management and value-in-use of 
products
• Optimise mine planning across the entire 
value chain can unlock significant 
productivity benefits (‘mine to mill’ and 
‘mine to customer’ mindset
IMPROVED 
SAFETY, ESG AND

OUTCOMES
• Improve the confidence of geoscience interpretations 
and verify existing resource and reserve assumptions
• Establish a reliable source of data for downstream 
optimisation – essential for the Internet of Geoscience 
(IoG) and optimising the entire mining value chain
• Capture data in IMDEXHUB-IQTM and integrate with 
existing mine data
• Supports data-driven decision making and automation
• Assess drilling performance immediately and reduce 
costly redrills
• Measure and record multiple physical properties at 
once from production drill holes
• Gain valuable rock knowledge via analysis to inform

• Demand for minerals used for clean energy 
presents a significant opportunity
• The mining industry must change to achieve 
net zero targets
• The challenge is to mine with limited emissions
– rock knowledge based on IoG and AI 
principles enable this
• Increasing demand for real-time orebody  
knowledge and smarter mining practices
• IMDEX IoG sensors enable a virtual rock for 
critical analysis and modelling further 
upstream – precision mining 
• IMDEX’s IoG systems of systems is well 
advanced
