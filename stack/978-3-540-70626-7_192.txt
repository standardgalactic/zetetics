Schr¨odinger Equation
Marianne Breinig
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the state of a physical system at a ﬁxed time
t0 is deﬁned by specifying a ket |ψ(t0)⟩belonging to the space ε. ε is a complex, sep-
arable  Hilbert space, a complex linear vector space in which an inner product is
deﬁned and which possesses a countable,  orthonormal basis. In the  Schr¨odinger
picture the time evolution of the state vector is governed by a partial differential
equation called the Schr¨odinger equation,
(iℏ∂/∂t)|ψ(t)⟩= H(t)|ψ(t)⟩,
which is a recipe for calculating |ψ(t)⟩when |ψ(t0)⟩is known. Here H is the
 Hamiltonian operator for the system.
The Schr¨odinger equation was developed by Erwin Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) in
1926 in coordinate representation, where the state vector is represented by a wave
function ψ(r,t). Schr¨odinger’s original aim was to ﬁnd a consistent mathematiza-
tion of De Broglie’s intuitive vision of the  electrons as standing  matter waves
around the nucleus. Like Louis de Broglie (1892–1987), Schr¨odinger hoped that
the  quantization of electron orbits would thus be reinterpretable as the result of
the condition that the electron waves around the nucleus are mutually reinforcing
themselves, i.e. as a periodicity constraint between the orbit 2πr equal to integral
multiples of their hypothetical wavelength λ. Because he knew from spectroscopic
ﬁne structure effects ( spectroscopy and Bohr-Sommerfeld’s model  Bohr’s
model) that the velocity of the electrons around the nucleus was actually quite
high, he ﬁrst attempted a relativistically invariant description, taking account of the
velocity-dependence of electron mass. A preserved Schr¨odinger-manuscript writ-
ten during a ski holiday in Arosa during Dec. 1925/ Jan. 1926 shows that he thus
ﬁrst ended up with an equation surprisingly close to the Klein-Gordon-equation,
found one year later by Oskar Klein (1894–1977) and Walter Gordon (1893–1939)
and then instrumental in Dirac’s  relativistic quantum mechanics of 1930. But
in early 1926, Schr¨odinger gave up his effort to formulate a theory of electrons
as standing waves in relativistically invariant terms and instead tried a simpler
non-relativistic variant (on the detailed reconstruction of Schr¨odinger’s pathway to
the equation named after him, differing strongly from the much more formal and

downright obtuse derivation presented his ﬁrst papers [1], see his selected corre-
spondence with various physicists [5] and various historical studies [6–10], partic-
ularly [7] and [8] for a close analysis of the surviving Schr¨odinger manuscripts and
his detour via  relativistic quantum mechanics).
Assuming that the electrons, interpreted as de Broglie matter waves, would sat-
isfy a classical wave equation, ψ + k2ψ = 0 for the amplitude ψ of their wave
motion around the nucleus, Schr¨odinger then inserted
k = 2π
λ , ⇒ψ + 4π2
λ2 ψ = 0,
with λ as hypothetical wavelength of the electron matter waves.
After inserting the de Broglie relation between electron wavelength λ and mo-
mentum mν, λ = h/mν, he must have obtained
ψ + 4π2m2ν2
h2
ψ = 0.
Inserting of the classical relation between total energy E, potential energy U and
kinetic energy T = (1/2)mν2 then yielded a simple non-relativistic wave-equation
E −U = 1
2mν2,
ψ + 8π2m
h2
(E −U)ψ = 0.
Until June 1926, Schr¨odinger still believed the ψ-function to be a real-valued func-
tion until he realized that he deﬁnitely needed complex-valued solutions of the type
ψ(t) ∼ψ0 · exp(2π iE t/h).
Because Schr¨odinger’s wave-mechanics, as it was soon called, promised a much
more intuitive understanding, allowed a much simpler and faster calculation of so-
lutions for various standard potentials V (r) and also yielded solution for problems
uncalculable for the competing formalisms of Heisenberg’s  matrix mechanics
and Born & Wiener’s operator mechanics with which it was then also proven to
be physically equivalent in 1926/27, the vast majority of physicists soon only used
Schr¨odinger’s approach which dominated the further development of quantum me-
chanics until 1930.
In more general terms, for a single particle the Schr¨odinger equation has the form
(−ℏ2/(2m))∇2ψ(r, t) + U(r, t)ψ(r, t) = iℏ∂ψ(r, t)/∂t.
The state vector |ψ(t)⟩encodes all the information the rest of the world, called
the observer, can have about the system at time t. A  measurement changes the
information the observer has about the system and therefore changes the state vector.
Between measurements, the state vector changes deterministically.
In free space (U(r, t) = 0), plane waves of the form ψ(r, t) = A exp(i(k·r−ωt))
are possible solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation as long as ℏω = ℏ2k2/(2 m). But

a plane wave is not square-integrable, it is not a proper wave function. Since the
Schr¨odinger equation is a linear equation, the  superposition principle applies,
and a linear combination of plane wave solutions is also a solution.
ψ (r, t) =

k
ak exp (i (k · r) −ωt) ,
as long as for each k we have ℏωk = ℏ2k2/(2 m).
Since k is a continuous variable, the most general solution is not a sum, but an
integral;
ψ (r, t) =

g(k) exp (i (k · r) −ωt) d3k,
where the function g(k) can be complex, g(k) = |g(k)| exp(iα(k)), and where
α(k) determines the phase of the plane wave. Such a  wave function is called
a three-dimensional  wave packet and can represent any non-pathological square-
integrable wave function. Proper wave functions of free particles are wave packets.
The Schr¨odinger equation can be solved analytically and exactly only for a
few simple systems. Approximation methods and numerical techniques are usually
combined to ﬁnd approximate solutions. If the Hamiltonian does not contain time
explicitly, then separation of time and space coordinates is possible. Any state vec-
tor |ψ(t)⟩can be expanded in terms of the  eigenstates of the Hamiltonian {|ψn⟩},
where H|ψn⟩= En|ψn⟩.
|ψ(t)⟩=

n
cn(t)|ψn⟩.
The eigenvalue equation for the  Hamiltonian operator H|ψn⟩= En|ψn⟩is called
the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation. In  wave mechanics it is solved in
coordinate representation.
Since the Schr¨odinger equation is a linear equation, there exists an operator,
called the evolution operator U(t, t0), that transforms |ψ(t0)⟩into |ψ(t)⟩.
The properties of this evolution operator follow from its deﬁnition and the
Schr¨odinger equation.
• U(t0, t0) = I.
• (iℏ∂/∂t)U(t, t0)|ψ(t0)⟩= H U(t, t0)|ψ(t0)⟩for any |ψ(t0)⟩.
Therefore (iℏ∂/∂t)U(t, t0) = H U(t, t0).
Properties (a) and (b) completely deﬁne the evolution operator.
• |ψ(t)⟩= U(t, t′)|ψ(t′)⟩, |ψ(′)⟩= U(t′, t′′)|ψ(t′′)⟩. Therefore |ψ(t)⟩=
U(t, t′)U(t′, t′′)|ψ(t′′)⟩= U(t′, t′′)|ψ(t′′)⟩.
We can generalize to U(tn, t1)=U(tn, tn−1)U(tn−1, tn−2) . . .U(t3, t2) U(t2, t1).
Let t′′ = t. Then U(t, t′)U(t′, t) = I, and interchanging the role of t′ and t,
U(t′, t)U(t, t′) = I. Therefore U(t, t′)−1 = U(t′, t).
• The Schr¨odinger equation yields
d|ψ(t)⟩= |ψ(t + dt)⟩−|ψ(t)⟩= −(i/ℏ)H(t)|ψ(t)⟩dt. Therefore
|ψ(t + dt)⟩= [I −(i/ℏ)H(t)]|ψ(t)⟩dt, and U(t + dt, t) = I −(i/ℏ)H(t)dt
is the inﬁnitesimal evolution operator.
U†(t + dt, t) = I + (i/ℏ)H(t) dt since I and H are Hermitian.

Schr¨odinger Equation
U†(t + dt, t) U(t + dt, t) = U(t + dt, t) U†(t + dt, t) = I, since for an
inﬁnitesimal operator we neglect terms higher than ﬁrst order in dt. The inﬁnites-
imal evolution operator is a  unitary operator. Therefore U(t, t0), which is a
product of inﬁnitesimal evolution operators, is unitary.
U†(t, t0) = U−1(t, t0) = U(t0, t).
• If H does not explicitly depend on time, then we can solve (iℏ∂/∂t)U(t, t0) =
H U(t, t0) for U(t, t0). We ﬁnd U(t, t0) = exp(−iH(t–t0)/ℏ).
If H does not explicitly depend on time, the evolution operator simpliﬁes ﬁnding the
time dependence of the state vector after the eigenstates of H have been found. The
state vector at time t0 is expanded in terms of these eigenstates and the wave vector
at time t is calculated from
|ψ(t0)⟩=

n
cn(t0)|ψn⟩,
|ψ(t)⟩=

n
cn(t0) exp(−iEn(t −t0)/ℏ|ψn⟩.
In the Schr¨odinger picture the time development of the state vector is entirely deter-
ministic provided that the system is left undisturbed
|ψ(t2)⟩= U(t2, t1)|ψ(t1)⟩.
In coordinate representation this yields for a single particle
⟨r2|ψ(t2)⟩= ⟨r2|U(t2, t1)|ψ(t1)⟩=

d3r1⟨r2|U(t2, t1)|r1⟩⟨r1|ψ(t1)⟩,
or
ψ(r2, t2) = d3r1⟨r2|U(t2, t1)|r1⟩ψ(r1, t1).
⟨r2|U(t2, t1)|r1⟩= K(r2, t2; r1, t1) is called the propagator for the Schr¨odinger
equation and can be interpreted as the probability amplitude that a particle that at t1
is located precisely at r1 will be found at r2 at time t2. The propagator is the Green’s
function for the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
[(−ℏ2/(2m))∇2
2 +U(r2)−iℏ∂ψ(r, t)/∂t2] K(r2, t2; r1, t1) = iℏδ(t2−t1)δ(r2−r1).
We may write U(t2, t1) = U(t2, tan) U(tan, tan−1) . . . U(ta2, ta1) U(ta1, t1),
i.e. we may divide the time interval t2 −t1 into subintervals. Then, by inserting the
closure relation for each subinterval we obtain
K(2, 1) =

K(2,1) can be interpreted to be the coherent superposition of the probability ampli-
tudes associated with all possible space-time paths starting at 1 and ending at 2.
This concept of the propagator as the coherent  superposition of the probabil-
ity amplitudes has led to Feynman’s postulates, a new formulation of the postulate
concerning the evolution of a physical system.

Erwin Schr¨odinger and Werner Heisenberg were the originators of two approaches,
known respectively as “ wave mechanics” and “ matrix mechanics”, to what is
now called “quantum mechanics” or “quantum theory”. The two approaches appear
to be extremely different, both in their technical forms, and in their philosophical un-
derpinnings. Heisenberg arrived at his theory by effectively renouncing the idea of
trying to represent a physical system, such as a hydrogen  Bohr’s atom model for
