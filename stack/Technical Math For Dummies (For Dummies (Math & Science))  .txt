About the Authors
Barry Schoenborn lives in Nevada City, California. He’s a longtime technical 
writer with over 30 years’ experience. He’s written hundreds of user manuals 
and (in the early days) worked dozens of part-time jobs that required practi-
cal math. He has been a carpenter for the movies, a stage electrician, a movie 
theater manager, a shipping clerk, an insurance clerk, and a library clerk. He 
has a bachelor’s degree in theatre from California State University, Fullerton.
Recently, his company worked with the California Integrated Waste 
Management Board to teach scientists and administrators how to write 
clearly. Barry is the coauthor of Storage Area Networks: Designing and 
Implementing a Mass Storage System (Pearson Education). He was a movie 
reviewer for the L.A. Herald-Dispatch and wrote a monthly political newspa-
per column for The Union of Grass Valley, California, for seven years. Barry’s 
publishing company, Willow Valley Press, published Dandelion Through the 
Crack, which won the William Saroyan International Prize for Writing.
Bradley Simkins was born and raised in Sacramento, California, and became 
a sixth-generation journeyman plasterer. But it didn’t take long (after many 
hours on construction sites) before he fi gured out that it was easier to 
use his brain than his muscles. He has a master’s degree in mathematics 
from California State University, Sacramento. He has taught, assisted, and 
tutored at the Multimedia Math Learning Center at American River College 
in Sacramento. He and his family live in Sacramento, where he owns Book 
Lovers Bookstore, an independent bookstore.


Dedications
Barry: To my teachers at San Juan High School in Citrus Heights, California: 
Mr. N. E. (Norm) Andersen (math); Mrs. Eada Silverthorne (English); 
Ms. Susan A. Schwarz (English); Mr. Norman E. Allen (physics); Mr. A. J. 
Crossfi eld (chemistry); and Mr. James C. Harvey (biology). They would be 
surprised and (maybe) pleased.
Bradley: I dedicate my work to my in-laws, Greg and Diane Manolis, who have 
always extended their hand to help with no complaints, and to my oldest 
daughter, Ashleigh, who taught me that failing does not make you a failure.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Barry: This book wouldn’t have been possible without the efforts of coauthor 
Bradley Simkins. We were supported by a great team at Wiley Publishing 
(Natalie Harris, Erin Mooney, and Megan Knoll) who worked hard to make this 
book a reality. They are the nicest people you’ll ever meet! A big thanks, too, 
to Matt Wagner of Fresh Books Literary Agency, who presented us to Wiley.
Our patient readers were Priscilla Borquez (who is fast, accurate, and sen-
sible, and who also has a great sense of humor); Jim Collins (an excellent 
and thorough technical communicator); Bill Love (who knows a zillion things 
about cars, machining, and welding); and Frances Kakugawa (author, poet-
ess, and lecturer to and supporter of Alzheimer’s caregivers, who was our 
poster child for someone who doesn’t understand story problems).
Many thanks to Patricia Hartman, who was always encouraging, and to Johna 
Orzalli, my haircutter, who taught me how to mix hair color. Thanks as well 
to Jeff Perilman at Dave’s Auto Repair for tips about smogging a car and spe-
cialized tools. And, fi nally, thanks and apologies to all the medical and dental 
staffs I fl ooded with questions.
Bradley: First, I thank Barry Schoenborn for all his hard work and dedication 
to make this work possible and for always going the extra mile to understand 
when my life became too hectic. I thank my beautiful wife, Audrey, and my 
beautiful children, Ashleigh, Brayden, Alexander, and Natalie, who make my 
life worth living. Thanks to Jill Marcai and Jens Lorenz for correcting all of 
our math mistakes. Last, but certainly not least, many thanks to the team at 
Wiley Publishing for taking on such goofballs.

Introduction
T
echnical careers require technical mathematics (technical math). That’s 
why we wrote Technical Math For Dummies. Whether you’re currently 
working in a technical trade or studying in school, you have probably made 
the discovery that most jobs require some math.
Most parts of technical math are simple. You may think some parts are hard, 
but look closer. After you read them, you’ll hit your forehead with the heel 
of your palm and say, “Yes! Of course! I sorta knew that all along, but now 
I really get it!” We think we’ve filled a gap in the world of math guides, and 
we hope you enjoy the book.
About This Book
This book is a reference. It’s also a repair manual that can help you fill voids 
you may have in your math background. It’s different from other math books 
in three major ways:
 
✓ It’s all about practical math. You won’t find anything about symplec-
tic geometry or sigma-algebra here. Our focus is on math for technical 
careers — it looks at problems you may deal with every day and the 
math skills you need to handle them. But we also include general prin-
ciples when necessary.
 
✓ It’s comprehensive. It covers all major math concepts; other math 
books are about individual concepts (for example, algebra, geometry or 
trigonometry).
 
✓ It’s not dull (we hope) as other math books often are. One of us (Barry) 
is a long-time technical writer, and he’s written far too many deadly dull 
user manuals. That nonsense stops here. Because it’s a For Dummies 
book, you can be sure it’s easy to read and has touches of humor.
Technical Math For Dummies applies basic math to basic tasks in many 
careers. You get practical examples, and most of them are based on real-life 
experiences. And in what other book can you work with math and also find 
out how to make 90 dozen pralines or figure the distance from a fire watch 
tower to a wildfire? You can also apply a lot of this math to your personal life 
as well as your work life.

2
Technical Math For Dummies 
At the risk of sounding like a late-night infomercial, we want to point out a 
couple of this book’s unique features. We gar-on-tee you won’t find them any-
where else.
Conventions Used in This Book
We designed this book to be user-friendly, maybe even user-affectionate. If it 
were any friendlier, it would drive itself to your house and bring coffee and 
doughnuts. To help you get the most out of your new friend, we use the fol-
lowing conventions:
 
✓ Italic type highlights new terms. We follow each term with a short and 
often informal definition. Occasionally, we give you clues about how to 
pronounce difficult words.
 
✓ Web addresses are in monofont. They’re usually very short and shouldn’t 
break across two lines of text. But if they do, we haven’t added any extra 
characters (such as a hyphen) to indicate the break. Just type in what 
you see.
 
✓ Although our English teachers would cringe at our breaking the rules, 
we usually write numbers as numerals, not words. For example, the text 
may say “add 9 to 3 to get 12,” not “add nine to three to get twelve.” We 
think this setup makes the ideas clearer in a math book.
What You’re Not to Read
We’d love for you to read every word in this book in the order it appears, but 
life is short. You don’t have to read chapters that don’t interest you. This ref-
erence book is designed to let you read only the parts you need.
You don’t have to read anything with a Technical Stuff or Did You Know? 
icon. That text is there to give you overly technical or trivial info. Sidebars 
(that’s what they’re called in publishing) are the shaded blocks of text you 
find every so often throughout the book. They’re interesting (we think) but 
not critical to your understanding of the main text, so you can skip ’em if 
you want.

3
 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
Although we know what happens when you assume, we went ahead and 
made a couple of presumptions about you anyway:
 
✓ We assume that you went to elementary and middle school, where you 
were exposed to math fundamentals. Why don’t we include high school? 
Because high school is where many people get bored, dazed, or frus-
trated with mathematics. You may have been in class, but maybe your 
mind was somewhere else.
 
✓ We assume you have access to a computer and the Internet. It’s not 
essential, but it’s very handy. Use a good search engine to find out more 
about any topic in this book.
How This Book Is Organized
Technical Math For Dummies has five parts, moving from simpler topics (such 
as counting) to more complex topics (such as trigonometry). Here’s how it’s 
set up.
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools
In this part, you get math basics (and we do mean basics). Chapter 1 gives 
you an overview of broad technical math concepts. Chapter 2 dispels myths 
about math and provides some history about technical careers. Technical 
professions are very old and go back (at least) to making arrowheads and 
spear points. And with all due respect to art history and library science 
majors, stonemasons built the pyramids. You also learn about the tools of 
the trades in this chapter.
The remaining chapters in this part are a complete review of basics — 
 numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, measurement, and 
conversion. You see how to do these operations faster and better. We also 
tackle something that everybody says fills them with fear and loathing — the 
notorious word or story problem. Story problems can be filled with tricks 
and traps, but in this chapter you see how easily you can deal with them all.

4
Technical Math For Dummies 
Part II: Making Non-Basic 
Math Simple and Easy
In Part II, you review the workhorses of technical math, the processes that 
are a simple step above arithmetic. Most careers can’t function without 
them.
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, 
and Trigonometry
You may think some topics (algebra, geometry, and trigonometry) are tough, 
but in this part you find out that they aren’t. The basic techniques are easy 
to understand, and those are the techniques you need. Now that’s a happy 
coincidence!
This part removes the mystery from formulas and shows you how to make 
your own custom formulas. It’s also filled with practical applications for 
areas, perimeters, and volume, as well as a little theory.
Part IV: Math for the 
Business of Your Work
In Part IV, we point out the obvious: “Life math” is different from “classroom 
math.” Although the previous parts have direct application to your technical 
work, this part brings some math concepts to the business side of your job.
In this part, you see how to use graphs and charts to your advantage for both 
problem solving and presenting information to management and clients. 
We also present a chapter on time math, which we hope clears up a few 
mysteries about the basic questions “What time is it?” and “How long will 
it take?”
The last chapter deals with computer math, and it’s a simple mini-education 
in what’s going on with your computer and your Internet connection. This 
chapter may help make you a smarter shopper when you’re buying comput-
ers, smartphones, MP3 players, and digital instruments for your business or 
your home.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
For Dummies books always have a Part of Tens, and this book is no excep-
tion. The world loves lists of ten things, and in these chapters you find a large 
amount of information in a small space.
Chapter 20 has ten principles for solving any common math problem. Its 
partner is Chapter 21, which contains the ten most commonly used formulas. 
It also has some formula variations and some estimating shortcuts. Finally, 
Chapter 22 shows you ten easy ways to get good at math while doing every-
day tasks. Finally, we also include a glossary of terms that you may or may 
not see in the text but that may pop up in your work.
Icons Used in This Book
We use several icons (the little drawings in the margins of the book) to call 
out special kinds of information and enhance your reading experience — 
that’s just the kind of people we are. Here’s a breakdown:
 
A Tip is a suggestion or a recommendation that usually points out a quick and 
easy way to get things done.
 
This icon represents a key idea that’s worth remembering — the information 
may come in handy later.
 
Technical Stuff contains information that’s interesting but overly technical 
and not vital to your understanding the topic.
 
Text with this icon contains odd facts (such as a legislature trying to regulate 
the value of pi), pieces of pop culture, strange bits of history, or bizarre terms.
 
The text with this icon describes a situation where a math principle is used in 
real-world work.
 
This icon alerts you to conditions that can spoil your work or result in wrong 
answers. For example, dividing by zero is never allowed in math. Don’t try it or 
your hair may catch fire!

Technical Math For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
You can go to any chapter of the book from here. First, check the table of 
contents, where you see the names of the parts and the chapters. Then, pick 
a chapter you’re interested in.
The book isn’t linear, so you can start anywhere. If you’re comfortable with 
some math concepts, take a glance at the early chapters of this book. This 
strategy will confirm how much you already know (and you may pick up a 
couple of interesting new words, too). Then go on.
If you’re uncomfortable with some math concepts (and some of them have 
truly bizarre and intimidating names), take a look at those chapters. Inside 
every “complicated” math concept is a simple concept trying to get out.
If you get stuck, you’ll probably find another chapter that can help you out. If 
you haven’t made a choice, we recommend beginning with Chapter 1, which 
introduces the broad concepts. If you have a particular problem, find a chap-
ter in the table of contents that deals with it and go straight to it, or simply 
look up that topic in the index.

Part I
Basic Math, 
Basic Tools

In this part . . .
P
art I starts with the basics. In Chapter 1, you find 
the broad scope of what technical math involves. 
Chapter 2 identifies the myths of math and the trades that 
make the world as you know it possible from earliest to 
latest. It also gives you a survey of tools (especially new 
digital tools) that make your work (particularly measur-
ing) in the trades easier and more fun. 
The other chapters in this part offer a complete review of 
numbers and arithmetic. But they’re more than just a 
good review — they also give you new insights and may 
even speed up your work. Chapter 6 is about measure-
ment and conversion. Sorry to say it, but the world speaks 
measurement in different units, and the modern techni-
cian needs to know unit conversions. Chapter 7 is about 
word problems. After you read this chapter, you’ll never 
run from a story problem again.

Chapter 1
Math that Works 
as Hard as You Do
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing the very basics of math
▶ Identifying the tools of the trade
▶ Looking at math’s basic disciplines and branches
▶ Applying math to the business of work
▶ Previewing ten of this and ten of that
T
echnical mathematics (technical math) is an essential part of the work and 
the education of everyone in a technical career. If you’re studying a trade 
in a two-year college or an occupational program, you can’t dodge it, whether 
you’re taking formal math courses or dealing with math calculations in spe-
cialized courses.
For example, Heald College is a famous college in San Francisco and much of 
California in general, as well as Portland and Honolulu. To get a degree as a 
medical assistant (Associate in Applied Science), you have to take Math 10, 
Essential Math; Math 103, Elementary Algebra; and Math 205, Modern Business 
Mathematics. And that’s for an education in healthcare.
Even if you’re already working in the field you want, you encounter plenty of 
technical math to do. All the construction trades deal with math to build build-
ings, pour sidewalks, install flooring, lay carpet, calculate fencing runs, and 
figure out how much paint goes on the walls. And because these trades are 
businesses, you have to figure amounts of materials, costs of materials and 
labor, and client billing. You may try to avoid math, but if you do, you may be 
avoiding a chance to advance your career.

10
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Bottom line: Math isn’t just something theoretical that professors in universi-
ties work with. It’s a practical skill used in most careers. Technical occupa-
tions built the world and also made it fit to live in. That takes technical math.
If math gives you the willies, heebie-jeebies, butterflies in the stomach, or palpi-
tations of the heart, suffer no more. Every principle in this book is easy, if you 
look at it the right way. Technical math is easier (not harder) than you think.
Discovering the Benefits of 
a Technical Math Book
Regular math books are fine, but we believe that you can get more benefit 
more quickly from a technical math book. A technical math book is all about 
practical math, focusing on math for technical careers — the math principles 
you’re likely to need in everyday work. Abstract math need not apply.
Unlike regular math books, which tend be about a single discipline (for exam-
ple, algebra, geometry, or trigonometry), a technical math book is comprehen-
sive so that you don’t have to go to several texts to get what you need. This 
book covers a little bit about a lot of subjects, and no subject goes deeper 
than you need it to go.
A good technical math book also includes practical examples based on real-
life experiences. As a result, you may even discover something about careers 
other than your own. And you may be able to apply a lot of workplace math 
to your personal life as well as your work life.
The Basics Are Basically Basic
The most basic component of math is numbers. The first thing you do with 
numbers is count, and you started counting when you were very young — as 
soon as you could talk, your mother probably cajoled you to tell Aunt Lucy 
how old you were or to count from one to five.
If you put numbers on a line, you get (are you ready?) a number line, shown 
in Figure 1-1. The number line is an arrangement of whole numbers called 
integers. (See Chapter 3.) With a number line, you can count as high as you 
want by going to the right and as low as you want by going to the left.

Counting is not only the first math thing you probably ever did, but it’s also 
the first thing that ancient people did. The earliest math discovery is the 
Ishango bone, a tally stick, and it’s more than 20,000 years old!
Another basic component of math is arithmetic. That’s addition, subtrac-
tion, multiplication and division. You learned them in elementary school, 
but if you didn’t understand them well, you may still have trouble with the 
processes today. Even if you knew them and then forgot them, you can get a 
refresher in Chapters 4 and 5.
 
The word arithmetic comes from the Latin word arithmetica, which comes 
from the Greek words for “counting,” “number,” and “art.” Yes, it’s the art of 
counting numbers.
When you know about numbers and know arithmetic, you’re on your way to 
becoming a technical math terror. They’re basic skills, but those basic skills 
handle a lot of the math in day-to-day life and prepare you for some more 
interesting topics.
Meeting Measurement and Conversions 
and Studying Story Problem Strategies
Measuring quantities and amounts is fundamental to every career; knowing 
your units is important. It sounds simple, but the world throws you a couple 
of curve balls with two different common systems of measurement (American 
and metric), which we cover in Chapter 6.
Chapter 6 also shows you all the basic units of length, area, weight, volume, 
and liquid volume and how to convert from one unit to another, an essential 
in technical work. You also see how to convert from one unit system to the 
other.
When you know your math basics and your conversions, you can slay math 
monsters faster than Conan the Barbarian slays movie monsters. But Conan 
had a vital tool you don’t have, the Atlantean Sword. That’s where Chapter 7 

12
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
comes in. It contains the tricks, traps, and techniques you need for solving 
story problems; with its help, you’ll laugh, scoff at, deride, and mock the so-
called word problems that come up in everyday work life.
Using Workhorse Math
Four math disciplines — fractions, decimals, percentages, and exponents — 
are the workhorses of your trade. All careers use one or more of them, and 
some careers use all of them.
You use these four workhorses for many utilitarian purposes, a little like the 
way draft horses have been used for logging, plowing, pulling beer wagons 
(yes, the Budweiser Clydesdales are draft horses), hauling freight, and trans-
porting passengers in horsecars. Like the horses, the math disciplines are 
strong and docile.
The chapters in Part II of this book tell you plenty about fractions, decimals, 
percentages, and exponents (and the exponent’s trusty sidekick, the square 
root), but here’s a little taste to whet your appetite:
 
✓ Fractions: Fractions come in various forms, including stacked, unstacked 
or inline, decimal, and percentage; check out the following for examples.
 
 You use fractions in just about every trade, and not only in doing your 
basic job — this math also comes up in working with time, money, and 
computer capacity. Find out more in Chapter 8.
 
✓ Decimals: Decimals are a form of fraction, and they’re essential for work 
in major trades. The laboratory and the machine shop are two places 
where you find a lot of decimal numbers. Chapter 9 gives you the details.
 
✓ Percentages: Percentages are fractions based on 100. You need percent-
ages to express portions of a whole quantity, and they’re at the very 
core of working with money. Head to Chapter 10 for more.
 
✓ Exponents and square roots: Exponents let you express very big and 
very small numbers (and do math with them) in a very compact way. 
Square roots help you solve a couple of pesky problems in your daily 
work. Chapter 11 has the lowdown on these concepts.

13
 Chapter 1: Math that Works as Hard as You Do
Building Your Knowledge 
of the Branches of Math
Some people say, “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,” but that’s not 
necessarily so. No knowledge is a dangerous thing.
Don’t worry if you have “a little knowledge” about math. The good news is 
that you only need to know a little and you’ll do fine. But perhaps the best 
news is that Part III helps you out by expanding what you do know.
Algebra makes any problem solvable after you figure out the formula you 
need. As Chapter 13 shows, formulas are easy to develop, and they make even 
complicated story problems (shown in Chapter 7) collapse into solutions.
Geometry, as shown in Chapter 14, lets you draw the various shapes you 
need to measure landscape jobs, dress patterns, or whatever your job 
requires. Plus, you develop a great vocabulary about lines, angles, and 
shapes that can aid you in your daily work.
 
Alexander Pope, the poet, first wrote this saying in An Essay on Criticism in 1709.
A little learning is a dangerous thing;
drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:
there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
and drinking largely sobers us again.
You may even use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of sides of a 
triangle. That’s part of a method for finding the areas of patios, yards, and 
odd-shaped rooms, and in special cases, you can even use it to find the area 
of a piece of pie. Figure 1-2 shows a classic geometrical view of the theorem.
 
Figure 1-2:

theorem.

14
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
In Figure 1-2, a2 represents the square of length a, and b2 is the square of 
length b. Also, c2 is the square of side c. Don’t worry about the letters or even 
the theorem now — we reveal all in Chapter 14. And check out Chapter 15 for 
help with areas, perimeters, and volumes.
In trigonometry, good math appears to be magic, but it’s really just good 
math. Trigonometry is essential for surveyors, land engineers, and fire look-
outs, to name just a few. When you do a little trig, you can easily figure out 
how wide a river is without getting your feet wet. The solution to this prob-
lem has eluded one of the authors (Barry) since he was Boy Scout, but with 
the help of Chapter 16, he (and you) can finally cross that bridge.
Life Math Isn’t Classroom Math
The math of the classroom is good. The principles are solid, and the math 
is conceptual as well as real. Classroom math improves your thinking, and 
improved thinking can greatly reduce the Homer Simpson “D’oh!” factor in 
your life.
However, the math of life is what you face every day. It’s good, real, and 
entirely practical. When you do life math, it directly affects your work and 
the people who depend on you. Your calculations can affect
 
✓ The appearance and building quality of a client’s new home
 
✓ Effective wildfire fighting
 
✓ Precise property line measurements
 
✓ Accurate reporting of patients’ vital signs
 
✓ Correct dispensing of drugs to patients
 
✓ The quantity, taste, and nutrition of what people eat
Luckily, the chapters in Part IV help you deal with this side of math. They 
help you use graphics (particularly charts and graphs), do excellent time 
accounting (for payroll and client billing), and make smart purchases of com-
puters and high-tech instruments (computer math).
“But wait,” you say. “I don’t do payroll or buy the computers, and no one 
has seen a graph at my office since 1972. Why do I need all this stuff?” The 
answer: Sometimes these math tools can be very valuable in your personal 
life. Pretend (and it’s not really pretending) that your wages seem flat, yet 
your family’s health insurance and out-of-pocket healthcare costs seem to 

15
 Chapter 1: Math that Works as Hard as You Do
be rising. Is that true? Find out by using a line graph (which we cover in 
Chapter 17). Figure 1-3 shows a comparison of annual wages and annual 
healthcare costs over several years.
The graph clearly shows something you’d hoped not to see. Healthcare costs 
are in fact overtaking your salary at a rapid rate.

Chapter 2
Discovering Technical Math and 
the Tools of the Trades
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying myths about math
▶ Highlighting important ancient contributions to mathematics
▶ Looking at the evolution of the trades
▶ Examining tools for technical math
M
athematics is useful and fun. Read that sentence again, because it may 
startle you. Math is useful and fun, and it can get you out of more trou-
ble than Superman and Batman combined. The main reason math is useful is 
that you can do so much with it; it’s a practical tool for solving problems in 
many careers. Finding answers to the questions and concerns that come up 
on the job is really satisfying. You get a great feeling when the light goes on 
and you say, “Oh! I get it!” And on the job, success is supposed to come to the 
person who gets the most things right. The trouble is, math gets a bad rap. No 
one knows who first started to give such a nice skill such a bad reputation — 
the search still goes on for whoever started spreading lies about math. As a 
result of this scoundrel, some urban legends about math still persist.
The technical work you do is vital in a world that relies on technology. And 
highly skilled technical work requires tools to get the work done. Look at the 
tools you use for technical math. Some are general, while others are very spe-
cific. Some simply measure, others calculate, and some do both. So what are 
the tools of the trades? They vary from career to career, but everyone uses 
a couple of tools. The two most important tools are your general math skills 
and the modern calculator. You need to know the math so you can appreci-
ate what the specialty instruments do for you, and so you can do the same 
operations if you don’t have such instruments handy.
In this chapter, you find out what technical math is all about. Add to that a 
little history, because if people have been doing this stuff for so long, how hard 
can it be? And you also get a view of what tools of the trades are available.

Busting Myths about Math
Many myths about math spring from two great myths. If you’re able to recog-
nize those myths, you’re well on your way to busting math myths yourself. 
The following sections introduce you to “I don’t need to use it” and “It’s too 
hard,” along with their cousin, “I have a phobia.”
“I don’t need to use it.”
Don’t mean to be rude, but talk to the hand, ’cause the face ain’t listening. 
Yes, you do have to use math. First, you need math to get through most pro-
grams of education (trade-related or otherwise). Then you likely need math 
on your job; even if the math is limited to counting and measuring, it’s math 
(and you can be sure we cover counting and measuring in this book).
You may think no math is involved in the culinary arts (the world of cooking, 
pastry, baking, and candy making), but think again. With all due respect for 
hamburger flippers, there’s a world of difference between grilling a double 
bacon cheeseburger and being executive chef at a three-star restaurant. The 
difference comes from a completing culinary school, which requires (wait 
for it) math.
 
The Michelin Guide started awarding stars to the best restaurants in 1926, and 
stars aren’t easy to get. The 2010 guide lists only 25 three-star restaurants in 
France and only 85 in the world.
Executive chefs do more than cook. They create, plan, budget, and do cost 
accounting. The work is a combination of art, cooking, and math. Even the 
food service operation of a hospital or retirement home requires math, such 
as scaling recipes up (as in turning a lasagna recipe that serves 6 into one 
that serves 300) and down (turning a recipe that serves 300 into one that 
serves 6).
The “I don’t need to use it” myth makes no sense to carpenters, cabinetmak-
ers, concrete masons, lab technicians, cooks, or surveyors, whose careers 
clearly require math to get the job done. The only exception may be those 
who don’t want to advance in a career. If you don’t want to go anywhere, 
don’t study math.
To be much more positive, if you do want to go somewhere, do study math. 
And take heart! Some fields require only simple arithmetic (addition, subtrac-
tion, multiplication, and division), which you need for everyday life anyway.

 Chapter 2: Discovering Technical Math and the Tools of the Trades
“It’s too hard.”
Another grand math myth is “It’s too hard.” This myth was probably started 
by a person who said that about everything. Life isn’t particularly easy, so 
the mantra probably got a big reception from everybody, not just those who 
were doing math. Survival isn’t easy. If you go back a zillion years (that’s an 
approximate date), you see that hunting for food was “too hard,” yet some-
how the human race hunted, survived, and got civilized.
You know what’s hard? Walking is hard. A human being isn’t constructed all 
that well for walking, but the average child learns how to walk by the time 
she’s about 11 months old. She looks a little clumsy at first but later becomes 
very proficient at walking as she does more of it.
Driving a car is hard, but most people can do it. They learn how to drive, and 
then (get ready) they drive. Two things make you a good driver: knowing the 
fundamentals and practicing.
That concept, of course, is shared by every professional dancer and athlete 
in the world. And it applies to just about every action or operation a profes-
sional does. It’s the same with mathematics. Know the fundamentals and 
practice. It’s a mantra you can live by. The carpenter’s first try at driving a 
nail probably bends the nail, and his first saw cut is probably crooked. But 
knowing the fundamentals and practicing eventually make the difference.
“I have a phobia.”
This misconception is a variation of the popular statements of denial in the 
preceding sections. Unfortunately, the argument doesn’t have legs, because 
all people approach new experiences with anxiety.
The distinction between anxiety and phobia is important. Anxiety is an 
everyday emotion. A phobia (a fear) is an anxiety disorder. Phobias are the 
most common form of anxiety disorders. In a study, the National Institute of 
Mental Health found that between 8.7 percent and 18.1 percent of Americans 
suffer from phobias.
You may have a phobia, but actual, legitimate math phobia (fear of not suc-
ceeding at math) isn’t common, regardless of what Internet hucksters try to 
tell (and sell) you. To be fair, math phobia does exist, but it’s not a perma-
nent condition; after sufferers experience even small amounts of math suc-
cess, they usually overcome it. So really, having a math phobia is even more 
reason to do math.

Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Remember: Somebody Else Already 
Did the Hard Work
Civilization makes math. But here’s a paradox. Math makes civilization. 
Mathematics started a long time ago in a galaxy far away (well, actually, on 
this planet). In the beginning, math was just about counting. (See Chapter 3.) 
And for a time in human existence, that was all people needed.
Well, being a hunter-gatherer is all very fine, but (to tweak an old song), we 
can show you a better time. That “better time” was nice, stable agriculture, 
which required some basic math to make it work when it was established 
about 10,000 years ago. Farming settles people down. It starts cities growing 
and it also produces specialized trades.
Math lets a culture do more, have more, and be more. As cultures grew more 
civilized, they needed to measure land and trade with other cultures. That 
requires math, so technical math grew and got sophisticated.
In the mere thousands of years from the cave dwellers to texting, mathemati-
cians made discovery after discovery. They not only figured concepts out but 
also did what are called rigorous mathematical proofs. To put it another way, 
if you read about something in a math book, it’s been proven true.
Ancient cultures from all over each provided something. Several cultures 
came up with the same concepts independently, and others passed concepts 
on to other cultures. Historians don’t know for sure exactly who did what 
when, because trustworthy history is based on written records, which don’t 
always exist.
The following list gives you an overview of some of these historic contribu-
tions. There’s no mystery in this very brief history — just highlights, folks, 
because the full story is enormous, and some of the details come up in the 
other chapters of this book. The point of this cultural timeline is to show that 
the math has been developing for a long time. The concepts in this book have 
been used by billions of people.
 
✓ Prehistory marks the birth of counting and tally sticks.
 
✓ The Babylonians introduced arithmetic, algebra, and geometry around 
3,000 BC. Math not only was handy for measuring the farmers’ fields but 
also helped the king collect taxes and astronomers look at the stars.
 
✓ The Egyptians gave humanity measurements, the math for agriculture 
(as early as 5,000 BC), and the math to build 138 pyramids (as early as 
2,630 BC).

21
 Chapter 2: Discovering Technical Math and the Tools of the Trades
 
✓ The Indus Valley civilization produced the concept of the decimal 
system and the concept of zero (about 100 AD).
 
✓ The Greeks provided, among other things, the systematic study of math-
ematics (between 600 BC and 300 BC). That includes rigorous arguments 
and proofs.
 
✓ The Romans, among their many contributions, developed the standards 
still in use today for the weight and purity of gold and for precious 
metals and gemstones.
 
✓ The Arabs were the conduit for the discoveries of China and the Indus 
Valley civilization to Europe. They formalized the concept of zero and 
made other brilliant discoveries on their own.
 
✓ The Chinese developed math independently and were making strides as 
early as 300 BC.
 
✓ The Europeans produced some wonderful math before and during 
the Enlightenment. Isaac Newton gets credit for calculus. Copernicus 
gets credit for modern trigonometry, and René “I think, therefore I am” 
Descartes had many hits on the top-100 math charts. He’s especially 
known for Cartesian coordinates. Head to Chapter 14 to see more about 
Cartesian coordinates.
 
✓ The Mayans had a super calendar and an excellent number system. 
They also had the concept of zero.
 
✓ All the other civilizations surely made unknown contributions. Where 
the historical record stops, the mystery begins. Perhaps the Hittites 
originated the credit card, or the Celts first developed the subprime 
mortgage.
The Trades, They Are A-Changing
Building technologies are probably the oldest trades, and they’re in no 
danger of disappearing. In fact, they’re more complex than ever. In addition, 
new trades are popping up regularly. As new careers come into existence and 
old careers evolve, the education and technologies that go with them must 
adapt. Trade schools (community colleges, technical colleges, and regional 
occupational programs) continue to offer vocational programs that expand 
as society’s needs expand, including creating green programs as environmen-
tal consciousness becomes more socially important.
These expansions reflect three broad trends. First, once-new technologies, 
such as automobiles and air conditioning, are a permanent part of modern life 
(yes, Virginia, cars and AC weren’t always common), so society must educate 

22
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
people to handle them. The second trend is the need to provide more special-
ized education for practitioners. The third trend is that education must offer 
training for the newest careers.
 
Here’s a tough assignment (NOT): Go see a movie. Make it an animated one if 
you can. At the end of the film, study the credits as they crawl by — you see 
the names of dozens of traditional Hollywood specialized crafts, but you also 
see many new careers. Some skill areas, such as computer generated imagery 
(CGI), were absolutely unknown not so long ago.
Technical careers continue to evolve. Some jobs haven’t been created yet, so 
we can’t exactly list them here. Other jobs are turning into professions right 
now as the required skills become more formalized and people need more 
advanced education in how to do them. As technology advances, your career 
will likely evolve into something other than what it is now. If you maintain 
your current skills — especially your math skills — and keep your eyes open 
for what a new career requires, you can transition with no problem.
Math Devices That Can 
Help You Do Your Job
Specialized calculators and measurement tools help you do your work more 
efficiently, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore general math skills. 
General math skills are great because they are general.
General skills are in your brain, which is a handy place for them. And you 
never have to replace batteries. You can use the skills in more than one 
career, which is excellent because experts say that the average person 
changes careers several times in a lifetime. Lastly, unlike a lot of tools you 
use on the job, you take your math skills home or anywhere else.
That said, some specialists make the same kind of calculations all the time, 
so specialty calculators devoted mainly to calculations needed for a particu-
lar trade are great additions to their math skills.
Some careers require more measurement than calculation; as a result, you 
can also find special measurement devices that give you exactly the infor-
mation you need. Because some of them contain a computer chip (such as 
a nursing assistant’s body mass index calculator), the machine does both 
measurement and calculation automatically, and the technician just sees the 
result as a measurement. The following sections give you a look at some of 
these calculators and measuring devices.

 Chapter 2: Discovering Technical Math and the Tools of the Trades
Pocket (or phone, or computer) 
 calculators
Although your mind is an excellent calculator, life is short and some calcula-
tions are long. For complex math operations or any math operation on items 
with many digits you probably need a calculator.
Get off your wallet and buy a pocket calculator
A basic calculator (sometimes called a four-function calculator) is really simple 
and very inexpensive. This calculator does four basic math functions: addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. But even the simple ones often 
include percentage and square root functions.
A more complex calculator is called a scientific calculator, but you don’t have 
to be a scientist (or play one on TV) to use it. This calculator not only does 
basic math but also has more buttons so you can do trigonometry functions, 
exponents and roots beyond square roots, and logarithmic functions that use 
both base 10 and base e.
Both types are still called pocket calculators. They have come a long way, 
since the first ones ranged in size from a box covering your entire desk to a 
“handy” unit the size of a large book. Eventually, they shrunk in size to fit in 
your pocket, and some are now so small they fit on a keychain.
You know your cellphone has one
That’s right! Your new mobile phone has a good calculator. For that matter, 
so does your older mobile phone. Just look for your phone’s application icon 
or go to the standard menu to look for the built-in calculator. It’s there.
 
Apple iPhones have a really cool calculator. When you hold the phone vertically 
(portrait mode), it’s a “regular” four-function calculator. When you rotate it to 
the horizontal position (landscape mode), it becomes a scientific calculator.
Do it with a mouse
Desktop and notebook computers have come with built-in simple calculators 
for a long time. In the Microsoft Windows operating system, the classic ver-
sion was a four-function calculator, as shown in Figure 2-1.

The classic Apple Macintosh (Mac) calculator is a four-function calculator. 
The dashboard calculator widget (an on-screen mini-application) that comes 
with the Mac OS X operating system has three options: basic, scientific, or 
programmable.

Spreadsheet programs are your friends
Microsoft Excel is the spreadsheet software that’s been wildly popular on 
PCs and Macs. It does far more than just calculations, but the calculations 
alone are impressive — the program contains dozens of built-in functions.
If the cost of Excel (about $230) concerns you, look at Sun Microsystems’ 
OpenOffice.org (billed as “the free and open productivity suite”). The Calc 
spreadsheet program is very similar to Excel, and the price is $0. Find it at 
www.openoffice.org.
Specialty calculators
Specialty calculators use predetermined formulas, and that’s okay. After 
you know the math behind the formulas, you can use the formulas with 
confidence. In the following sections, check out some of the many specialty 
calculators you can find. To get you started, you can find an extensive set of 
online calculators (hundreds of them) at www.martindalecenter.com/
Calculators.html.
 
Sometimes an Internet calculator isn’t really a calculator — it’s a table of 
factors to consider in doing a calculation. Such calculators work, but you’re 
better off to consider them estimators rather than calculators.
Machinist calculator
Machinist calculators are geared (no pun intended) for machine shop cal-
culations. You can find numerous machinist calculators online, including 
the Trades Math Calculator for PCs. Go to www.tradesmathcalculator.
com/ or www.freedownloadmanager.org/downloads/machinist_
calculator_software/.
 
One of the great machining calculators isn’t a calculator at all. It’s The 
Machinery’s Handbook, a giant book of tables (the 2008 edition — the 28th — 
is over 2,700 pages!). It was first published in 1914.
Conversions and one-time calculations
The Internet is filled with free, simple conversion programs. You can find 
conversions for angles, weight, temperature, fuel consumption, and so on. 
For example, point your browser to www.onlineconversion.com/.

Plumbing and pipefitting calculators
Flow calculations are important in many plumbing applications, and a pipe 
flow calculator is a great example of the computerization of complex formu-
las. This calculator helps you work out pipe pressure drop and pipe diam-
eters. Visit www.pipeflowcalculations.com/.
Roof surface area calculator
For roof coatings, one estimating calculator uses a table. You start with the 
interior square footage of the house to be roofed. Then you make allowances 
for roof overhang, the thickness of the walls, and the slope of the roof. After 
that, you consider the type of roof to be coated, as well as wastage. When 
those figures are all in place, the table gives you the total roof surface area to 
buy coatings for. You can find this tool at www.somay.com/roof_coatings/
roof_calculate/roof_calculate.html.
 
You can also work out roof surface area from direct measurements or from 
blueprints, and that may be the smarter way to go because an online roof sur-
face calculator can only provide an approximation.
Thermometers and sphygmomanometers
A key part of the certified nursing assistant’s (CNA’s) work is to take a 
patient’s vital signs — temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Thermometers 
are essential for taking the temperature of the human body. For decades, the 
temperature was displayed as the height of a thin column of mercury in a 
glass tube. Now, digital thermometers display temperatures in either degrees 
Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius.
Blood pressure is measured with a blood pressure cuff, or sphygmomanometer. 
That’s easy for you to say! Try saying “sfig-mo” and combine it with “man-om-
eter.” That’s the device with an inflatable cuff and gauges. Figure 2-3 shows 
you an old-fashioned version, but these days, many blood pressure cuffs are 
digitized, and the CNA can take the readings directly from the instrument. The 
blood pressure cuff measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
 
Blood pressure measures two kinds of pressures in the arteries, which is 
why it includes two numbers. A measurement such as 120/80 comes from old 
blood pressure devices that showed the pressures as the height of columns 
of mercury in two tubes. So, 120 refers to a column of mercury pushed up 
to 120 millimeters by the patient’s systolic blood pressure, while the 80 
refers to the patient’s diastolic blood pressure. For more on working with 
metric units, see Chapter 6.

The CNA determines your pulse rate by counting just a few heartbeats while 
watching a watch for a few seconds; she then multiplies to get beats per 
minute. Pulse is traditionally measured by using a stethoscope and a watch. 
However, today’s digital blood pressure cuffs include pulse rate in the dis-
played output.
Micrometers, calipers, and gauges
Machinists have incredibly complex jobs, making the parts for just about 
every item you use. Even parts made of plastic are machined, or the molds to 
make them are. At its simplest, a machinist does drilling, milling, turning, and 
grinding. Except that’s not simple.
Nowadays, most machine tools (such as mills, turning centers, and drilling 
machines) are computerized. The machine does much of the cutting for the 
machinist, but that doesn’t make things automatic. Every step has to be pro-
grammed, and the machinist has to calculate feed rates and cutting speeds, 
based on the material and the cutting tools used.
Online and downloadable calculators can help machinists with the needed 
calculations. (Check out the earlier section “Machinist calculators” for infor-
mation on these calculators.)

28
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
When the work is complete, the machinist uses micrometers, calipers, and 
gauges (shown in Figure 2-4) to make sure the work is accurate. These are 
measurement tools, not math tools.
Micrometers are also common in engineering applications wherever you must 
measure small dimensions precisely. You see calipers used in a variety of fields, 
including automotive technology (see the example in Chapter 15) and medicine.

Automotive tools
The local garage says that its mechanics can acquire up to $50,000 in tools 
after just a few years working. Many are specialty tools, such as the gas 
analyzer in Figure 2-5, used only in auto work. Devices like brake thickness 
gauges, coolant testers, and hand code readers require measurement and 
recording information, not math.
One thing auto technicians won’t want to acquire on their own is a diagnostic 
computer, which analyzes the various computer systems in a vehicle. Because 
so many cars are managed by one or more computers, it takes a shop diag-
nostic computer (with frequent upgrades) to be able to read the codes that 
cars generate.

29
 Chapter 2: Discovering Technical Math and the Tools of the Trades
 
Figure 2-5: 
Many auto-
motive tools, 
such as the 
gas ana-
lyzer, are 
unique to 
mechanics.
 
The smog check computer (formally, an emission analyzer) is another com-
puter at the auto mechanic’s shop. It determines whether your car meets 
your state’s emission standards. After a number of visual checks (for example, 
fuel cap, crankcase smoke), the mechanic connects an RPM measurement 
device and puts a probe in the tailpipe. The computer does the rest, including 
sending the results over phone lines to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
In a world with that much automation, it’s kind of a comfort to know that you 
still measure cylinder bores (diameters) and brake pads (thickness) with 
manual tools (calipers and brake thickness gauges, respectively; see the pre-
ceding section for more on calipers).
Tire pressure is a common measurement at the garage, with digital gauges 
often replacing the older mechanical gauges.
 
One great retro tire measurement that doesn’t even involve math is the penny 
test for tire tread depth. Place a penny into several tread grooves on the tire, 
with Lincoln’s head pointing in. If part of his head is covered by the tread, you 
 
have more than 
 inch of tread depth remaining. Note: Legal tread depth is 
 
defined in 42 states as 
 inch, with some variations in other states.
Carpentry tools
As a carpenter, your work is measurement- and calculation-intensive. That’s 
no surprise. What is a surprise is that, with all of the computerized measuring 
tools available, the carpenter’s tape measure is probably the most frequently-
used tool of the trade. You use it to make measurements and also to apply 

30
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
the results of your calculations to wood that’s to be cut or drilled. The math 
involved is usually arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi-
sion), which we cover in Chapters 4 and 5.
The steel square may be a contender for second place. That tool helps you lay 
out right angles, but it’s more important for laying out rafters, hip rafters, and 
stairs. When you lay out a roof pitch, the math is arithmetic, with a bit of ratio 
work thrown in. (See Chapter 8 for more on ratios.) A great low-tech carpen-
ter’s tool is the spirit level (which you probably know as just the level). It’s a 
short length of wood or metal with a small liquid-filled tube in the middle. The 
tube contains a bubble; when the level is horizontal, the bubble rests between 
two marks. Figure 2-6 shows you an example. High-class spirit levels may have 
additional tubes for measuring vertical or 45-degree inclinations.
 
Figure 2-6: 
A level.
 
The level has pretty much resisted going high tech. However, newer laser 
levels project straight lines with the touch of a button. What makes the 
line level with this device? Yes, a little built-in bubble spirit level.
Bricklaying tools
Bricklayers need their work to be level and straight. It’s essential and (along 
with mortar throwing) is part of why bricklaying is an art form. Chalk lines 
(made with spirit levels such as the one shown in Figure 2-6 and a tool called 
a chalk line, shown in Figure 2-7) are important. Math is secondary in the 
basic work; the important thing is to use the tools correctly.
However, as a bricklayer, you need to use a relatively large amount of math in 
preparing for work. You use multiplication to determine the area of a wall and 
division to calculate how many bricks the job requires. This figure in turn leads 
you to calculate how many bags of cement and sand (or pre-mixed mortar) you 
need for the job. See Chapter 5 for details about multiplication and division.

A chalk line.

N
umbers aren’t only part of civilization but were in use before civiliza-
tion even existed. With the earliest peoples, you can imagine that verbal 
communication wasn’t even necessary when it came to mathematics. If Og 
found some mastodons for dinner, he went to his tribe, made the sign for a 
mastodon, and pointed in the direction where he saw them. Then, even though 
he had hoped the group would hold their questions until the end of the presen-
tation, someone would jump in and make the sign for “How many Hairy Tusk 
Beast you find?” Og had the answer “at hand.” He would hold up some fingers 
to indicate how many, and the gang would run off to hunt mastodons.
Og’s descendants now live in an era of double-knit stretch polyester and 
smartphones, but the need to use numbers for communication hasn’t 
changed. Some careers are more number-intensive than others, but every 
trade uses numbers. If you have friends who say they can’t do math, please 
remind them that they can do numbers. This ability is what separates human 
beings from the lower-order creatures, such as oysters and fire hydrants.
 
The beauty of numbers in counting (their simplest application) is that answers 
come with no skills besides counting. However, even counting requires careful 
administration. And for speed and efficiency, you can go beyond counting to 
arithmetic, as we show you in later chapters.
In this chapter, you review the common types of numbers you work with and 
some uncommon, strange, and unbelievable numbers, too. You also explore 
the secrets of zero. All this requires no more than a set of fingers and toes to 
count with.

Looking at the Numbers that Count: 
Natural Numbers
Natural numbers are basic numbers, which are also called counting numbers. 
Most people just call them numbers. Natural numbers have a familiar look: 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so forth. They’re whole numbers (as opposed to fractions) and 
they don’t include zero (0) or negative numbers. They serve two purposes:
 
✓ Counting: Counting is the technique you use for inventory and all stock 
keeping. Natural numbers are also the fundamental unit of purchas-
ing, no matter what your line of business is. Today, online shopping 
carts ask the fundamental counting question “How many?” Whether 
you’re counting or buying 500 milliliter Erlenmeyer flasks or barrels of 
transmission fluid, you’ve got to know what quantity you have or want. 
Using natural numbers takes on a personal meaning after work. As 
you stand in the express checkout line, your blood is chilled by a sign 
reading “Ten items or less.” You must quickly count the items in your 
cart (notice that the types of products, their prices, or their sizes don’t 
matter anymore) to make sure you’re not above the maximum.
 
✓ Ordering: You use natural numbers for ordering, describing things in a 
certain order. When you list the first (1st), second (2nd), third (3rd), and 
fourth (4th) largest cities in your state, you’re using natural numbers 
for ordering. In your personal life, using numbers for ordering becomes 
painfully clear at the Department of Motor Vehicles. You hold a small 
piece of paper that says “#89,” and an electric sign says “Now serving 
#4.” The numbers show the order in which people are being served and 
your position in that order. They also show that you’re in for a long wait.
 
The set of natural numbers doesn’t include zero. In simple counting, you can’t 
have zero apples or zero oranges. Zero is part of a larger group of numbers. 
Check out “Zero: Making math easier” later in the chapter for more on this 
number.
 
However, an exception exists in the field of computing: Zero becomes the first 
counting number and takes the first position in arrays and other data struc-
tures. Don’t be surprised to see for(i=0;i < 100;++i); sum = sum + grades [i]; 
used to loop through positions 0 to 99 in a 100-element array.
Integers: Counting numbers with extras
Integers are like counting numbers, but there are more of them. The set not 
only includes the counting numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so forth) but includes 
zero (0) and negative numbers (–1, –2, –3, –4, –5, –6, and so forth). You can 

33
 Chapter 3: Zero to One and Beyond
also call these numbers whole numbers. Say the word integer with a soft g. 
That is, say “in-tuh-jer.” Taken together, integers form a nice line:
 
. . . –6 –5 –4 –3 –2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 . . .
 
Integers can be positive or negative, odd or even. A negative number is a 
number that’s less than zero. Of course, a positive number is greater than zero. 
An even number can be divided by 2 with no remainder. An odd number can’t 
be evenly divided by 2. Zero is an even number. However, it’s not positive or 
negative — it’s just zero.
These integers look as orderly and evenly spaced as the chorus line in a 
Broadway musical. And it’s no wonder, since each integer differs from the 
others beside it by just one. As you can imagine, if you have an infinitely wide 
stage, the negative integers at the left extend forever. The positive integers at 
the right do the same thing.
Integers are the numbers you use to perform all simple math. You can do all 
arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and most divi-
sion) with integers. Integers are also useful for plotting the points on a graph 
or chart.
 
Where do they get these names? The word integer comes from Latin and 
means untouched. You can’t touch an integer, so you can’t break it — it’s an 
unbroken or whole number. (Speaking of untouchable, integer is a relative of 
the word integrity.)
Zero: Making math easier
What is zero (0)? How can it be important when it’s really nothing at all? Zero 
may look like nothing, but it represents something — it appears in numbers 
and in calculations where digits ought to be. It’s a placeholder, a kind of punc-
tuation mark that helps you interpret numbers correctly.
And why’s that valuable? Because you (and most of the world) use a decimal 
number system, and it’s a positional system. In a three-digit number, such 
as 123, those digits are more than just a 1, a 2, and a 3:
 
✓ The position of the 1 means that 1 is the number of hundreds, because 
it’s in the third column from the right.
 
✓ The position of the 2 means that 2 is the number of tens, because it’s in 
the second column from the right.
 
✓ The position of the 3 means that 3 is the number of ones, because it’s in 
the first column from the right.

34
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Pretty straightforward so far, because you don’t need a placeholder. But 
what happens when you have one hundred and three single items? How do 
you write that without a placeholder?
 
✓ You can write 13, but that’s misleading and just plain wrong.
 
✓ You can try 100 + 3, but such a system of notation makes math opera-
tions much tougher.
 
✓ You can try Roman numerals and write 103 as CIII, but the disadvantages 
of Roman numerals (with only seven symbols and no zero) are many 
and make the system a poor candidate for math.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, what you need is a placeholder. In the 
number one hundred and three, let the 1 show one hundred, use a 0 show no 
tens, and have the 3 show three units, giving you 103.
 
Zero and the decimal system made most other math systems obsolete. 
Mathematicians point out that the decimal system is a base 10 system. The 
Maya of Central America used a base 20 system, and they used zero, too. 
There are vestiges of the base 12 system in today’s twelve-hour clocks. And 
for the nerdy band of brothers, the computer age brought forth the base 2 
(binary) and base 16 (hexadecimal) systems.
Zero can be your biggest friend in mathematics because it makes for quick work:
 
✓ Whenever you multiply anything by zero, the answer is always zero. For 
example, 3 × 0 = 0; 274,561 × 0 = 0; and so forth.
 
✓ When you add 0 to a number, the answer is the same number. For exam-
ple, 2 + 0 = 2, 27 + 0 = 27, and so forth.
 
✓ Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. For example 7560 = 1, and 70 = 1. 
See Chapter 11 for more on powers and exponents.
See how nice zero can make your math life? Anytime you’re solving a math 
problem, look for zero. It doesn’t look like much, but it can help you.
Where did zero really come from?
Historians cite many different civilizations 
that might have developed decimals and zero, 
but the system may have evolved in the Indus 
Valley (near the western edge of modern-day 
India), and the Indians may have gotten tech-
niques from China. Then the word spread to 
the Middle East. In 976, Muhammad ibn Musa 
al-Khwarizmi said if there was no number in a 
place, you should use a little circle. The Arabic 
word for that little circle is safira (meaning it 
was empty) or sifr (meaning nothing). That led to 
the modern English word cipher. Sifr also leads 
us to the Italian word zefiro (meaning zephyr or 
zephyrum) and the Venetian contraction zero.

35
 Chapter 3: Zero to One and Beyond
Going Backward: Negative Numbers
As we mention earlier in the chapter, a negative number is a number that’s 
less than zero. You represent negative numbers with a minus sign; for exam-
ple, –1, –23, and –8,542. Zero isn’t negative (but it’s not positive, either).
Negative numbers may seem like a fantasy concept, but they’re very real in 
many lines of work.
Working with negative numbers
In mathematics, negative numbers are a concept. But concepts don’t put 
bread on the table (unless you’re a mathematician). In your daily activities, 
you work with negative numbers in the real sense, and they almost always 
represent a reduction or a deficit.
 
In some trades, when a positive quantity decreases, the math “stops” at zero. 
In parts management, food management, or hospital stockroom management, 
when you have 0 of something, you’re all out. There’s no concept of negative 
widgits, negative eggs, or negative IV solutions. But the reason you get to 0 
units is because of inventory draws (reductions), and each reduction in inven-
tory is the application of a negative number. Stock on hand minus the amount 
of the draw results in a new, lower amount of stock on hand.
In virtually all trades, accounting transactions can result in amounts lower 
than zero. For example, when a cosmetologist is sick, she has no clients 
(no inflow of cash), but the rent is due on the station at the salon (outflow 
of cash). Not so good. Low income and high expenses can occur in the 
construction trades, the automotive trades, and even in a doctor’s office. 
Negative cash flow is a real and painful concept. And if the business checking 
account is overdrawn, that’s a very serious negative number.
 
Negative numbers aren’t always grim. For example, the countdown — the 
process of counting hours, minutes, and seconds backward until something 
happens — is a “positive” application of negative numbers. It’s part of NASA 
rocket launches, adds drama to action movies, and announces the start of 
each new year.
Traveling down the number line
In mathematics, negative numbers are part of series of numbers. One way to 
visualize the series is to draw a number line. Put 0 in the center, mark posi-
tive numbers to the right of 0, and mark negative numbers to the left of zero. 
Figure 3-1 shows a number line.

The farther to the right of 0 on the number line you go, the larger the num-
bers get in value. The farther to the left of 0 you go, the more the numbers 
decrease in value. Looks can be deceiving. For example, the 9 in –9 is has a 
larger magnitude than the 8 in –8, but the minus sign (the negative sign, –) 
makes a difference. A larger negative number has less value than a smaller 
negative number.
And although negative numbers may seem to be the opposite of positive 
numbers, they act the same, and you can do the same math operations 
with them.
Getting Between the Integers: Fractions, 
Decimals, and More
Life was simpler in the third grade with only integers to deal with. But then 
again, you didn’t get a paycheck for attending the third grade. So there comes 
a time in your career when you must also know about other types of numbers.
In between the integers are many other numbers, known as common frac-
tions, decimal fractions, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. Although 
integers are nice, clean numbers to work with, you can’t ignore the numbers 
in between them.
Our fractional friends
Fractions are the most common numbers in the technical careers. A fraction 
is part of a number, more than zero but less than one. The word comes from 
the Latin fractus or frangere, which means broken or to break, as opposed to 
integers, which are unbroken whole numbers.
The two kinds of fractions are common fractions, which look like this:

37
 Chapter 3: Zero to One and Beyond
and decimal fractions, which look like 0.46, 0.375, or 0.87695. If you combine a 
whole number with a fractional number, the result is called a mixed number. 
For example, 5.243, $14.95, or

The leap from 0 to 1 is “one small step for math, one giant step for mathkind.” 
It looks small, but in between 0 and 1 are many fractions (an infinite number, 
as it turns out).
The rational numbers(and their 
irrational friends)
On the job and in your personal life, you have two kinds of friends: rational 
and irrational. Both kinds are valuable to know (except maybe the one who 
puts bean sprouts and peanut butter on pizza). The same is true with rational 
and irrational numbers: You’re better off knowing both.
A rational number can be expressed as a ratio, the quotient of two integers. 
Any common fraction fills the bill, as it shows the ratio of the top number to 
the bottom number. What about 0.75? This decimal number is really the frac-
tion seventy-five one hundredths, and when shown as a common fraction: 
you see that it’s a ratio.
Following are examples of rational numbers:

38
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Like the integers and like the fractions, mathematicians have proved that an 
infinite number of rational numbers exist.
You can express some numbers as fractions, but they produce infinite deci-
mals in a repeating sequence. For example:
An irrational number is always acting out. It won’t let you express it as a 
simple fraction, and as a decimal fraction the digits go on forever in no 
repeating sequence. As you see, the irrational numbers don’t behave in a 
rational way.
The most famous irrational number is π (pi, the Greek letter, pronounced 
pie). Pi the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference. You were 
first exposed to π in grade school, and you may use it in work if you calculate 
circular areas or the volumes of cylinders.
Pi has been calculated to over one trillion (!) decimal places, and the calcula-
tions still don’t come out evenly. And they never will.
 
At least once, the government has tried to legislate the value of pi. (Oh, how 
we authors wish we made these things up.) In 1897, the Indiana House of 
Representatives considered a bill that would have set pi to a value of 3.2.
Two other numbers, Euler’s Number (the number e) and the Golden Ratio 
(represented by the Greek letter phi, ϕ), are also famous irrational numbers.
Taking a Look at the Lesser-Known 
Numbers
The numbers you encountered so far in this chapter are the numbers you use 
in your work and at home. Here is the lightning round of other number types. 
One type describes everything we’ve discussed in the chapter so far, two 
types are never used except by mathematicians, and (to finish on a positive 
note) you use the last two types every day.
Real numbers
Real numbers is the name for all the numbers covered in this chapter to this 
point. That includes natural numbers, integers, fractions, positive numbers, neg-
ative numbers, zero, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. They’re all real, 
meaning you can find any of these numbers somewhere on the number line.

39
 Chapter 3: Zero to One and Beyond
Imaginary numbers
An imaginary number is a number that includes the square root of –1. This 
value is supposedly impossible. In real life, you can’t square a number and 
get –1, but in conceptual life, you can. The math expression is:
The symbol for the imaginary unit is i. A number that includes i (for example, 
i or 7i or –3i) is imaginary.
 
Early mathematicians thought imaginary numbers were useless. In the 1600s, 
mathematician René Descartes wrote about them. He used the term “imagi-
nary,” and he didn’t mean it as a compliment.
But the world of mathematics evolved, and in time mathematicians found the 
concept of imaginary numbers to be very useful. You use imaginary numbers 
in engineering disciplines like signal processing and vibration analysis.
Complex numbers
These aren’t numbers with a psychological disorder. But they’re not simple 
numbers, either. A complex number is a combination of a real number and an 
imaginary number.
You write it in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the 
standard imaginary unit.
Nominal numbers
A nominal number (sometimes called a categorical number) is a number you 
use for identification only. It doesn’t matter what the value of the number is. 
Here are some examples of nominal numbers:
 
✓ Social Security Number
 
✓ Vehicle Identification Number
 
✓ Drivers License Number
 
✓ Inventory part numbers
 
✓ Universal Product Code
 
✓ The combination for a lock or safe. (Some locks and safes even use 
 letters instead of numbers.)

Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Handling Numerical Story Problems
Story problems (sometimes called word problems or life problems) are math 
problems where the details are presented more as a story than with straight 
figures. Not to worry. Story problems aren’t hard to solve. Check Chapter 7 
for all the details about story problems.
Example: Automotive tech — 
a slippery task
 
You work at a BMW motorcycle dealership. You hope to study more auto-
motive technology in school and open your own shop some day. But at the 
dealership, you have a pretty basic starter job, and your boss asks you to 
determine the on-hand quantity of BMW motor oil. Determine how many plas-
tic containers of oil you have.
Indefinite and fictitious numbers
You’d think number means precise and precise 
means number. No, not so. Humans are an infi-
nitely clever species. They created the pet rock, 
the Furby, and the iPod. And indefinite numbers.
An indefinite number is a term for a quantity. You 
use it when you don’t know the exact amount of 
the quantity. The following are just a few indefi-
nite numbers. You know, just a handful.
 ✓ A few 
✓ Plenty
 ✓ Several 
✓ Scads
 ✓ Bunch 
✓ Heaps
 ✓ Many 
✓ Tons
 ✓ Lots 
✓ Buckets 
These are “quantity” indefinite numbers. 
“Amount” indefinite numbers include mite, 
smidge, glug, and dollop.

41
 Chapter 3: Zero to One and Beyond
 
1. Take a look at the entire quantity to be counted.
 
 The following figure shows the number of containers to be counted:
 
2. Count the containers.
 
 The answer is 48 containers.
 
 The boss is pleased. He takes you to another stockroom and gives you a 
similar problem. The following figure shows a new group of containers 
to be counted:
Simple counting solves the problem. In the figure above, you have 448 
 containers.

42
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Arithmetic, however is more efficient. With arithmetic, you would have fig-
ured out there are 16 rows of containers, with 28 cans in each row. Then you 
would have used multiplication to multiply the number of rows by 28 to get 
the total number of cans.
The moral of the story (and actually there are two):
 
✓ Counting is good, but it has its limitations.
 
✓ Doing a good job on a tedious task sometimes gets you involved with a 
more tedious task.
By the way, BMW motorcycles don’t use oil — they use engine lubricant. The 
difference between that and oil? About $4 per quart.
Example: Getting the order right
 
You and a co-worker are in the drive-through at Taco Palace. Together, your 
order is three tacos, two burritos, and two soft drinks. When you get to the 
pick-up window, you get your order but it doesn’t seem right. Use counting to 
confirm its correctness.
 
1. Count the soft drinks.
 
 Either speak the number or use your fingers. If you speak, the results 
should be “One, two.”
 
2. Count the burritos.
 
 Again, either speak the number or use your fingers. The results should 
be “One” “Two.”
 
3. Count the tacos.
 
 “One” “Two”
Wait! Something’s wrong here. You ordered three tacos and you only got two. 
The order is short. Let the person at the pick-up window know.
Notice that for this problem only counting was required. The problem 
doesn’t need arithmetic. The beauty of numbers in counting (their sim-
plest application) is that answers come with no skills beside how to count. 
Although this example is extremely simple, it shows that counting is some-
times the fastest, most accurate way to solve a problem.

very career has its basics — fundamental techniques that are the start-
ing points for every other technique. In carpentry, you begin by ham-
mering a nail and making a simple cut with a saw. In cooking, you begin with 
simple recipes. Even in sports, such as boxing, baseball, and the martial arts, 
you start with a basic stance. In fact, no matter what you’re doing, if you 
don’t get the fundamentals right, you’re pretty much assured of having prob-
lems later.
Math is the same way. The basics are addition and subtraction. They’re just 
a step beyond counting and form the basis for all other math operations. 
Counting is well and good (see Chapter 3), but eventually you run out of fin-
gers and toes. That is to say, eventually counting is tedious, and you must go 
on to addition and subtraction.
 
If you live in the rain forest (like, for example, the Nadëb of Nadahup, Brazil) 
and don’t have any commerce, you may have no need to count, add, or sub-
tract. Your number system doesn’t have any specific numbers above one. The 
Nadëb use a “1-few-many” system.
Because you probably don’t live in the rain forest, you should read this chap-
ter. It’s not one page long. It’s not many pages long. It’s a few pages long.

44
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
In this chapter, you review exactly what addition is and the parts of the addition 
operation. You do the same thing with subtraction. These two operations don’t 
have much mystery, but you explore what mysteries they do have — carry-
ing in addition and borrowing in subtraction. You also see the easiest ways to 
check your work.
Making Everything Add Up
Addition is the process of combining quantities. You probably knew this, 
because addition is an operation you grow up with. Mothers command their 
sons, “Johnny, tell Aunt Ida how much one and one is.” And sons (even if 
their names aren’t Johnny) respond by saying, “One and one equals two.” 
This exchange is cute when you’re 3 years old, but by the time you’re 21, it’s 
tiring for both you and Aunt Ida.
Each item to be added is an addend. The result is the sum (which comes from 
the Latin summare, “the highest”).
When you add, use a plus sign (+). You add in a row and use an equal sign 
(for example, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15) or in a column using an underline. For 
example:
Addition works with all kinds of numbers — integers, zero, rational numbers, 
fractions, and irrational numbers. In fact when you see a mixed-number 
such as 
that’s really the addition of 3 and .
That is:

45
 Chapter 4: Easy Come, Easy Go: Addition and Subtraction
The same is true with decimals. For example, 3.654 is the sum of 3 and 0.654. 
That is:
3 + 0.654 = 3.654
Adding numbers in a column
When you have several numbers to add (say, more than three), the best way 
to add is in a column. To add in a column, simply arrange the numbers so 
that they are all aligned on the right side, and begin the addition process.
This technique is obvious in a spreadsheet such as like Microsoft Excel or 
OpenOffice Calc. Because these applications are cell-based, vertical columns 
are the logical approach to addition. Figure 4-1 shows addition in Excel.

Note that you can also add cells horizontally in a spreadsheet. This feature is 
handy when you want to verify addition of a large number of items in several 
rows and columns. The technique is called downfooting and crossfooting, and 
you can find details on the Internet. Basically, you sum the columns and the 
rows and compare the results for accuracy.

46
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
 
Be careful with certain tools. A spreadsheet shows you what items you’re 
adding. So does a printing calculator (yes, they still make them). But when you 
use a pocket calculator or smartphone, you usually can see only the growing 
sum “so far” in the LCD window. Be sure that you’ve entered all the items to 
be added if you want the correct sum.
Adding zero
When you add 0 to a quantity, the quantity doesn’t change. For example, 
23 + 0 = 23. You can do this all day long (for example, 23 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 
23), but that won’t change the answer.
And of course, adding 0 to 0 gets you 0. You express this as 0 + 0 = 0. This 
concept is what’s called, in technical terms, a whole lotta nothin’.
Adding negative numbers
If you had the wisdom, taste, and discernment to read Chapter 3, you know 
that negative numbers have a minus sign (–) in front of them and are num-
bers less than 0. (Don’t worry; you can still get wisdom, taste, and discern-
ment by reading Chapter 3 later.)
You can add negative numbers. No problem. The result of adding negative 
numbers is a larger negative number.
In algebra, you express the idea as:
–a + (–b) = –c
Adding multiple negative numbers is as easy as adding multiple positive num-
bers. For example, –1 + (–2) + (–3) + (–4) + (–5) = –15. It’s clearer to illustrate 
this addition as a column, because it eliminates all those + signs.

47
 Chapter 4: Easy Come, Easy Go: Addition and Subtraction
Carrying the extra
Adding in any digit position (for example, the ones column, the tens column 
or the hundreds column) is easy. But what do you do when the result it more 
than ten? You carry.
The term carry means that when the results of adding a column are higher 
than 9, you record the right-hand digit (the ones number) and add the left-
hand digit (the tens number) to the next column.
For example, if you add 5 + 4 = 9, it is (in professional terms) called a no 
brainer. Just add.
But what about adding 428 and 186? Not so simple.
Adding the 6 and the 8 in the ones column gives you 14, but the ones column 
can’t hold more than a single digit. (Well, to be fair to the poor ones column, 
no column can hold more than a single digit.) What to do?
Record the 4 and carry the 1 to the next column. This process is simple, but 
we describe it fully here anyway for clarity. Look at the addition of 6 and 8 in 
the ones column.
The sum of 6 and 8 is 14, so you write the 4 as part of the sum and carry the 1 
to the top of the tens column. Then it’s “second verse, same as the first.” Add 
the carried 1 to the 2 and the 8 in the tens column.

48
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
The result is 11, and that two-digit result won’t fit in a column that was built 
to hold one digit, much like those pants you were able to fit into before 
Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners but can’t now. So, you write the 11 as 1 
in the tens column and carry the one to the top of the hundreds column.
Now, one more addition completes the work.
The answer is 428 + 186 = 614.
Checking your work
This tried-and-true tip is old as the hills and twice as dusty. To check addi-
tion, add the column in reverse order. You should get the same sum. If the 
problem is
Just add “up” the column.
The answer should be the same. You can also subtract the individual 
addends, one at a time, from the sum until there’s 0 left, but that’s a far more 
tedious process.

49
 Chapter 4: Easy Come, Easy Go: Addition and Subtraction
Subtraction: Just Another 
Kind of Addition
Subtraction is the process of removing a quantity from a quantity. It’s also 
called the inverse (or the opposite) of addition.
Subtraction is the second math operation you grew up with (besides addition). 
Your Aunt Ida may have said, “Jane, if you had three apples and I took two, 
how many would you have left?” The mathematically and politically correct 
answer is, “One apple, Aunt Ida.” The other answer — the one that will get you 
in trouble — is, “I’d still have three, you greedy old woman, because I wouldn’t 
let you take any. And you’d have a black eye for trying to steal my apples.”
 
Subtraction is the only tool for figuring differences and remainders. The words 
essentially mean the same thing and you may see either of them in subtrac-
tion problems. A remainder is the balance of a quantity left after it has been 
reduced by subtraction. A difference is a numeric comparison between two 
quantities.
 
✓ If you have five apples and give two apples away, how many are left? The 
number you have left is the remainder.
 
✓ What’s the difference between $600 and $800? The answer, $200, is a 
comparison of two quantities.
 
✓ If you see a mileage sign, “Omaha, 180 miles” and the last one you saw 
said “Omaha, 210 miles,” how far have you traveled in between them? 
The number of miles you’ve travel is the difference between the first and 
second distances.
The number you subtract from (which is usually the larger number) is called 
the minuend. The number you are subtracting is the subtrahend. The result 
is the difference. Rest assured, these terms don’t come up very often in 
 everyday talk.
When you subtract, use a minus sign (–). You can subtract inline and use an 
equal sign (for example, 23 – 10 = 13) or you can subtract in a column. A sub-
traction problem in a column looks like this:
Like addition, subtraction works with all kinds of numbers — integers, zero, 
rational numbers, fractions, and irrational numbers.

Subtracting a positive is the same 
as adding a negative
What does it mean to say that subtraction is the inverse of addition? In alge-
bra, you’d say
a – b is also a + (–b)
Yes, subtracting b from a is the same as taking a and adding –b to it. This 
may not seem like a big deal now, but it becomes important when you get to 
algebra (see Chapter 12). For more info about positive and negative numbers, 
flip to Chapter 3.
Subtracting negative numbers
You can subtract negative numbers. The peculiar thing is that subtracting a 
negative is like adding a positive.
In algebra, you express the idea as
–a – (–b)
The catch is that subtracting a negative number changes the sign. The result is
–a – (–b) = –a + b
Subtracting zero
When you subtract 0 from a quantity, the quantity doesn’t change. For example, 
23 – 0 = 23. Subtracting 0 from 0 is equal to 0. That’s 0 – 0 = 0, and that’s nothing.
Subtracting multiple items
You can subtract multiple items all at once, but be careful — doing so may be 
a little confusing.

51
 Chapter 4: Easy Come, Easy Go: Addition and Subtraction
This column of subtractions really represents multiple individual subtractions. 
23 – 10 = 13, 13 – 5 = 8, and 8 – 5 = 3.
Subtracting multiple items is more obvious in a spreadsheet. Figure 4-2 
shows subtraction in Microsoft Excel.

The answer is 3, and it’s really the result of adding all the numbers (positive 
and negative) together.
 
When you’re subtracting multiple items, be careful. Spreadsheets and printing 
calculators tell you the whole story, but pocket calculators and smartphones 
only show the results so far. Be sure you’ve entered all the items to be sub-
tracted if you want the correct answer.
You can take shortcuts, such as adding all the negatives first. In the example
you can first combine the negatives.

52
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
The subtractions are lumped-together negatives, and you subtract them from 
the positive amount:
The answer is still 3, just as before.
Borrowing when you have to
In real life, you’re better off if you avoid borrowing. In subtraction, you do it 
all the time to make subtraction easier.
The term borrowing refers to converting one unit from the next position (at 
the left) into the units you are working with. As you know, the positions of 
the numbers are the ones column, the tens column, the hundreds column 
and so forth.
You can freely borrow from the column at the left of the column you are 
working in. To illustrate this, say you want to do this subtraction:
Look at the ones column. If you were subtracting 3 from 6, you could easily 
do it in your head. But how can you take 6 from 3? You can’t, but you can 
take 6 from 13.
But where do you come up with 13? Look at the subtraction problem this way:
To make the 3 in the ones column into 13, just borrow a single 10 from the 
tens column. That reduces the tens column by 10, and the problem looks 
like this:

53
 Chapter 4: Easy Come, Easy Go: Addition and Subtraction
Now you have an answer for the ones column. It’s 7. But you’re left with 
another problem in the tens column. How do you take 50 from 10? Same 
story — borrow a single 100 from hundreds column. That reduces the hun-
dreds column by 100, and the problem looks like this:
The hundreds column is a no-problem column. Just subtract. The problem 
now is
When you lump the numbers together again, you see the answer is 267. Or to 
put it another way:
 
The world’s most famous line about borrowing is from Hamlet. Polonius gives 
some good advice to his son, Laertes, before the boy goes off to college in 
Paris. Polonius says, “Neither a borrower nor a lender be/ For loan oft loses 
both itself and friend/ And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.”
Checking your work
To check subtraction, the rule is simple: Just add the difference back to the 
subtrahend to get the minuend. It should be the same number you started 
out to subtract from. For example, in the problem:
add 267 back to 156 (267 + 156 = ???). The answer is 423, the number you 
started out with.

Example: Sheep on Trucking
 
You’re in the Sheep Program, part of the Department of Animal Science, and 
you’re an intern at a ranching operation.
This morning, you counted 1,750 sheep in the pens, and now you have a 
smaller number. Your supervisor asks you how many trucks picked up the 
missing sheep today. Can you tell him?
You can’t proceed until you confirm two important facts:
 
✓ How many sheep are left in the pens
 
✓ How many sheep a truck holds
Fortunately, the answers are at hand.
 
✓ 850 sheep are left in the pens.
 
✓ Each truck holds exactly 100 sheep.
 
This setup is, by the way, an example of the classic “double whammy” story 
problem. The answer isn’t about sheep — it’s about trucks. But you can get 
there from here.
Here’s how to approach the problem.
 
1. Subtract the number of sheep left from the number of sheep you had 
at the start of the day.
 
 The difference is the number of sheep trucked away.
 
 900 sheep have been trucked away today.
 
2. Figure out how many trucks hauled the sheep away.
 
 Do this part in your head. If 900 sheep are gone and each truck holds 100 
sheep, how many trucks picked up sheep? If you don’t want to do it in 
your head, do this division.
The answer is nine trucks.

Baa, baa, black sheep
Basque people started coming to America from 
Spain in the 1850s because of the California gold 
rush. They became synonymous with “sheep-
herder” in Nevada. They used black sheep 
as markers, and the herder would only count 
the black ones. If they were all with the herd, 
chances were all of the sheep were together. 
If a black sheep was missing, the herder and 
his dogs would set out in search of the miss-
ing black sheep and whatever other sheep had 
gone with this marker.

▶ Performing basic short and long division
M
ultiplication and division are parts of basic math, and they’re as 
essential as addition and subtraction (see the preceding chapter). 
The good news is that just about everybody learned multiplication and divi-
sion in elementary school. The bad news is that many people have forgotten 
how to do these operations. And if you didn’t like math in your earlier school 
years, you probably forgot even faster.
Note: We’re not going to make excuses for you — you need to be responsible 
for your own knowledge — but if you struggle with math fundamentals, it 
may not be entirely your fault. 1989 brought a considerable change to math 
teaching standards, with a decrease in learning fundamentals, so depending 
on your age, you may have been a victim of the early “new math” instruction 
and may not have gotten all the basics you needed.
If you had problems with multiplication and division in elementary, middle, or 
high school, be troubled no more. They’re simpler than you may remember.
And they’re important. Why? Because they’re essential to your work, whether 
you multiply pounds of cement or bytes in a disk sector or divide fluids or 
flour. And the conversion of all weights and measures requires multiplication 
and division. (Check out Chapter 6 for more on measurement and conversion.)

58
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
In this chapter, you discover the names of the parts of multiplication and 
division equations as well as a couple of different ways to multiply and 
divide.
Go Forth and Multiply!
What do you do if you’re at work, attending a meeting, or at an appointment 
and you need to do some quick multiplication, but your calculator or phone 
is in your car, which is parked about a zillion miles down the street? You can 
mumble something about forgetting something and make a mad dash to your 
car, or you can use the skills in the big carbon-based calculator in your head, 
your brain. The following sections show you how to take the latter route.
Mastering multiplication terminology
Don’t freak out at the thought of unaided multiplication. Multiplication is just 
a form of repeated adding. For example, you typically say the equation 3 × 4 
= 12 as “three times four equals twelve.” But you can also write that equation 
as 3 +3 + 3 + 3 = 12, which you say as “three added four times equals twelve” 
or “three plus three plus three plus three equals twelve.”
And that’s repeated adding. This process works pretty well until you have 
to multiply, say, 459 × 661 = 303,399. That’s a lot of repeated adding, so in 
this case you want to use manual multiplication, which we discuss in “Doing 
Simple Multiplication Like Your Grandfather Did It” later in the chapter.
Every art and craft has its special words, and multiplication is no different. In 
multiplication, the number to be multiplied is called the multiplicand, and the 
number doing the multiplying is the multiplier. The result is the product. To 
make things more interesting (by which we mean “confusing”), sometimes the 
multiplier and multiplicand are generically called factors. Look at the example 
459 × 661 = 303,399. Here, 459 is the multiplicand, 661 is the multiplier, and 
303,399 is the product. The numbers 459 and 661 are factors of 303,399.
 
One popular online source says that multiplication was documented in the 
Egyptian, Greek, Babylonian, Indus valley, and Chinese civilizations. And the 
Ishango bone, found in the then-Belgian Congo in 1960 and dated to about 
18,000 to 20,000 BC, has marks that may suggest knowledge of addition and 
multiplication. Just speculation about the use, but the marks are real.
You run across a variety of math symbols that represent multiplication. Don’t 
be alarmed. They all mean the same thing: multiply. Sometimes, depending 
on the problem, you can more easily and cleanly show multiplication by 
using one symbol rather than another.

59
 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
Popular symbols include parentheses [( )], a single dot (·) called a middle dot, 
the times symbol (×), or even an asterisk (*). The asterisk is used mainly on 
computers, adding machines, and on some calculators. Here are these signs 
in action:
(7)(3) 
7 · 3 
7 × 3 
7*3
All of these examples are saying “seven times three.”
Another sign of multiplication is no sign. This situation occurs in algebra 
when numbers and letters appear together, such as in the term 3ab. That 
means 3 × a × b. We cover algebraic variables more thoroughly in Chapter 12.
Sometimes multiplication is represented as a grid, so you can see the num-
bers represented as rows and columns. Figure 5-1 shows you how 3 × 10 can 
be represented as three rows of ten columns.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Multiplica-
tion shown 
as a grid of 
objects.
 
Memorizing multiplication tables: 
Faster than a calculator
Sources say that the Chinese invented the multiplication table. But regard-
less of who came up with it, you should commit the multiplication table to 
memory. It’s a must-do thing, and it’s not that hard. Here’s why nailing the 
times table is such a worthwhile pursuit:
 
✓ You probably learned it in school and may just need to review.
 
✓ The multiplication facts involving zero and one are easy (flip to “Easy 
Street: Multiplying by 0, 1, and 10” later in the chapter for the skinny on 
these shortcuts).
 
✓ It only goes up to 9 × 9.
 
✓ You need it to do longer multiplication and division problems.
 
✓ It’s faster than a calculator.
Look at that last point. It’s true. You can say “seven times seven equals forty-
nine” faster than you can punch the numbers into a calculator.

Figure 5-2 shows a classic multiplication table. It’s a 9 x 9 but includes 0 as

the 3 row). Read across until you come to the column you want to multiply by 
(such as the 6 column). The answer is where the two meet (in this example, the 
answer is 18). Figure 5-3 shows how to use the table to find a value.

 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
Doing Simple Multiplication Like 
Your Grandfather Did It
Handheld calculators didn’t become accessible to businesses and schools 
until the early 1970s, but of course people had to do multiplication somehow 
before then. That’s where the traditional multiplication (the kind you actually 
do with pencil and paper) in this section comes in. It can serve you when the 
batteries are dead and also help you gauge the reasonableness of products 
displayed by a handheld calculator.
 
It’s believed that the original calculator (a kind of abacus) was developed 
by the Egyptians around 2,000 BC. Other sources say it goes back farther, to 
ancient Mesopotamia, and others cite China. The first adding machine was 
developed in the 17th century, and the late 19th century saw the introduction 
of the first commercially developed adding machine.
 
Always perform every step of a multiplication problem, and make sure you do 
each step neatly. If the answer is wrong, you can more easily track the steps 
you took to arrive at it.
To solve a simple multiplication problem by hand, just follow these steps:
 
1. Write out the multiplication problem.
 
 Say you want to multiply 23 by 4. Write the factors down as follows, so 
that the tens and ones columns in each factor line up.
 
 
 
2. Multiply the each column in the multiplier by the multiplicand.
 
 You multiply 4 times 3 and 4 times 2. The same is true for longer multi-
pliers, no matter how many digits it may have.
 
 If your multiplication results in a number higher than 9, you record the ones 
number and carry over the tens number to the next column. After you do 
the multiplication for that next column, you add the carryover number to 
that result, carrying over again into the next column if necessary.
 
 
 
 The product of 4 times 3 is 12. The result is higher than 10, so just write 
the 2 in the ones column and carry the 1.

62
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
 
 Then, the product of 4 times 2 is 8. Add the carried 1 and write the 
result, 9, in the tens column, as shown
 
 
Sometimes, though, you have a multiplier with more than one digit. In those 
cases, the solving process is a bit more complex.
 
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 of the basic multiplication process earlier in this 
section.
 
 For example, say you want to multiply 7,089,675 by 345. Write the prob-
lem down as follows, so that the hundreds, tens, and ones columns in 
each factor line up.
 
 
 
 Multiply each digit in the multiplicand by the ones-column digit in the 
multiplier.
 
 Start with the 5 in the 345 on the bottom. You multiply 5 times 5, 5 times 
7, and so on, moving from right to left until you’ve multiplied by all the 
digits in the multiplicand. Remember to keep your work organized by 
bringing each answer straight down, keeping it aligned with its appropri-
ate column.
 
 The top row in the following example shows the carryovers from this 
step’s multiplication:
 
 
 
2. Repeat Step 1 with the digit in the tens column of the multiplier, insert-
ing a placeholder of 0 (zero) in the ones column of this multiplying step.
 
 You use this zero placeholder because multiplying by 4 is really multiply-
ing by 40 (because the 4 represents 4 tens, or 40, in the context of the 
whole number). As we note in the following section, any number times 
10 shifts its decimal point one place to the right, and in the case of whole 
numbers, that amounts to adding a zero at the right. So adding this place-
holder reminds you to account for the zero in the ones place of 40.

63
 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
 
 The following shows the placeholder:
 
 
 
 With the 0 in place you can now multiply the 4 through the multiplicand. 
Write the result next to the 0 placeholder. The result follows, with the 
carryovers in the top row:
 
 
 
3. Repeat Step 2 for the remaining digits in the multiplier, adding place-
holder zeroes as appropriate.
 
 As in the previous step (multiplying by a number in the tens column), 
you need to add placeholder zeroes for the hundreds column, the thou-
sands column, and all other columns in the multiplier. The placeholders 
keep things lined up and help ensure that the answer will be correct.
 
 The following shows the placeholders for the example problem:
 
 
 
 The following shows the example’s complete multiplication for this step, 
with the carryovers in the top row:
 
 
 
 Oh, happy day! The multiplication is now over and just one final step 
remains.

64
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
 
4. Add the partial products to get the answer.
 
 It’s normal addition. Take the first column on the far right and add 
together 5 + 0 + 0. Continue with each column.
 
 
 
 The answer is 2,445,937,875.
Using a calculator for multiplication and division
These days, your math brain is your pocket cal-
culator and, increasingly, your cellphone. On 
many phones, you can even find a tip calcula-
tor, which is a multiplication application (app). 
When your mind knows the principles of mul-
tiplication (and indeed, other math principles, 
too), your fingers can work with confidence. 
Then you can let them do the walking on the 
calculator or phone keyboard.
Knowing fundamental multiplication and divi-
sion (including the multiplication table) saves 
you effort. For example, you don’t need waste 
time with a calculator to multiply 2 × 2.
Doing manual multiplication and division is 
often faster and easier than using a calculator 
app. Of course, this knowledge is handy if you 
don’t have your phone with you, but that’s not 
the main reason to know the principles.
Practicing the principles of manual multiplica-
tion and division makes you much more aware 
of the reasonableness of calculator answers. 
When you have a sense of what a reasonable 
answer is, you can question calculator results 
if necessary. This ability is important because a 
calculator usually produces only a final answer, 
and it can be way off if you don’t pay attention.
Having said that, a calculator is a mighty handy 
tool. Check out the following example of multi-
plying two large numbers using a small set of 
keystrokes:
2

The answer is 10,695. Here’s a division example:

The answer is 21.47826. To do this math by hand 
would take time that you can probably better 
spend on another task.

 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
Checking your work
To check a product in multiplication, divide by one of the factors. For 
example, if you do the problem 3 × 4 = 12 and you want to check the work, 
divide 12 by 4 and you get 3, verifying your answer.
3 × 4 = 12
This example is obvious, but the principle is also true for larger numbers, 
such as this example from earlier in the chapter:
7,089,675 × 345 = 2,445,937,875
Divide the answer by either of the original factors to check your work:
2,445,937,875 ÷ 345 = 7,089,675
2,445,937,875 ÷ 7,089,675 = 345
No matter which factor you choose, the division always yields the other 
factor as the answer, assuming you’ve done the math correctly. If you come 
up with different answer, go back and check your work.
Easy Street: Multiplying 
by 0, 1, and 10
If traditional multiplication makes you sweat (see the preceding section), 
remember these three shortcuts that can help you get your multiplication 
answers more quickly. The shortcuts are simple:
 
✓ Check for multiplication by 0.
 
✓ Check for multiplication by 1.
 
✓ Check for multiplication by 10.
With these shortcuts, you can get your job done quickly, make your boss 
happy, and enjoy a bright future (well, at least you’ll get your job done 
speedily).

Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
A zero pulse: Multiplying by 0
Anything multiplied by 0 (zero) is just that, zero. No matter what numbers 
you try to multiply by zero — whole numbers, fractions, decimals — the 
product is still zero. Find a pattern in the following example.
 1 × 0 = 0
 2 × 0 = 0
It’s obvious. But if you don’t believe us yet, look at any multiplication table 
(such as the one in Figure 5-2 earlier in the chapter): The 0 column and 0 row 
both produce 0 as the product in every one of their squares. When you see 
“× 0” in a math problem, just call the answer 0 and move on.
One is the loneliest number: 
Multiplying by 1
Actually, one may or may not be the loneliest number, but for simplicity, it’s 
in a strong competition with its brother 0. Anything multiplied by 1 is itself. 
Period. The following examples illustrate the point:
Knowing this rule helps you get to the answer and move on to a more pro-
ductive task. What about zero? Well, when it’s multiplied by 1, the answer is 
itself, 0 (0 × 1 = 0). See the preceding section for more on multiplying by zero.
Multiplying by 10
If you’re multiplying a multiplicand by 10, a great shortcut is to just put a 
zero to the right of the multiplicand and stop. That’s the answer.

67
 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
For example, the product of 3 and 10 is probably obvious to you: 3 × 10 = 30.
Notice that the product is the multiplicand, 3, with a 0 attached.
If you do the math manually, you see that this shortcut works because the deci-
mal number system is a positional system (see Chapter 3) and because of the 
principles you apply to exponents of 10 (see Chapter 11). That is, multiplication 
by 10 is the same as shifting a number’s decimal point one place to the right.
 
You can extend the principle to other multiples of ten:
 
✓ If you’re multiplying a multiplicand by 100, put 00 to the right of the 
multiplicand.
 
✓ If you’re multiplying a multiplicand by 1,000, put 000 to the right of the 
multiplicand.
What about 5 × 20 (which equals 100)? That’s not multiplying by 10, but you 
know that 20 is really 2 × 10. So put the ideas together by separating 20 into 
2 and 10.
5 × 20 = 5 × 2 × 10
There! You have just factored 20 into 2 and 10. Multiply 5 by 2, giving 10, and 
then add the 0 (for multiplying by 10). That produces 100. And you did it in 
your head.
Divide and Conquer
You probably remember a collective sigh (or groan) in the third grade when 
the teacher told you that you were going to do division. It’s traditionally the 
most dreaded basic math operation out there. And if you didn’t get it in the 
third grade, they threw it at you twice as hard in the fourth grade.
Division is the opposite (or inverse) of multiplication. Multiplication is repeated 
adding, so division is repeated subtracting. For example, consider 12 ÷ 3 = 4.
You say this equation as “twelve divided by three equals four.” Here is an 
example of getting the answer by repeated subtraction:
12 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 = 0
If you subtract 3 from 12 four times, you have nothing left to subtract. This 
method works, but it’s pretty tedious and certainly wouldn’t be fun with big 
numbers.
The following sections introduce you to the division dictionary and help you 
get the hang of the various kinds of division. For real-world problems, your 

68
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
calculator will likely be on hand, but knowing the techniques here can help 
you out in a calculator-less pinch and improve your understanding of what 
you’re doing with the calculator. We also give you some shortcuts to relieve 
the division headache just a bit.
Dealing with division definitions
Like multiplication, division has special names for its components. The number 
you divide into is called the dividend, and the number you divide by is called 
the divisor. The result is the quotient. Take a look at the following example:
101,439 ÷ 221 = 459
In this example, 101,439 is the dividend, 221 is the divisor, and 459 is the 
quotient.
What if your division doesn’t come out in a nice, even quotient? The remain-
der is what’s left over when the dividend can’t be evenly divided by the divi-
sor. In the example 13 ÷ 3, the divisor 3 goes into 13 four times, but that just 
makes 12. You have a remainder of 1, the part that can’t be evenly divided. 
You write this as r1 after the four (4 r1).
 
To be very formal about it, the algorithm for division can be stated as a = bq 
+r, with qualifiers as to number type, range, zero and non-zero conditions, 
and remainder conditions. It’s very impressive, but it’s not good reading.
Division has a few different math signs, but they all amount to the same 
thing — time to divide. They’re largely interchangeable, but sometimes choos-
ing the right division sign makes your work easier. You may see the classic 
division symbol (÷) or a forward slash (/), which is the division sign of choice 
on a computer keyboard. Sometimes division appears as a stacked fraction, or 
an inline fraction like the one found in the third of the following examples.
All of these examples mean “seven divided by three.”
One special tool for division is the tableau, from the French for “table” or 
“picture.” When it’s empty, it looks like this:
When it has numbers in it, it looks like this:

69
 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
The dividend goes inside the tableau. The divisor is at the left. The quotient 
(as you develop it) goes above.
Dividing by using the inverse
Because division is the inverse of multiplication, one way to divide is to invert 
the divisor (divide it into 1) and multiply. Note: Using the inverse isn’t the 
common method, but we do use it in our fraction discussion in Chapter 8, so 
we want to tell you about it here.
Say you want to divide 35 by 7. Normally, the expression is 35 ÷ 7 = ?.
Get the inverse by dividing the divisor into one. The inverse of 7 is
So for the task of dividing 35 by 7, you can set up this multiplication problem:
Now, just calculate the answer, which is 5.
Doing short division
Short division is a simple, fast way to do division. It just takes a pencil and 
paper, and you can do a lot of it in your head. Knowing your multiplication 
table makes it faster (and luckily, we present one in Figure 5-2 earlier in the 
chapter). Basically, short division breaks the dividend into chunks.
But short division has limitations. It works better with smaller divisors, up 
to about 12, and if the problem gets complicated, you’ve got to switch to long 
division.
A simple case of short division
Here’s a simple division problem, with no remainders.
 
Imagine you have a high volume of sulfuric acid — 48,488 fluid ounces, to be 
exact. You have four carboys to store them in. How many ounces do you put 
in each carboy?

70
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Use the following short division process to find the answer:
 
1. Write the dividend and divisor in the tableau.
 
 In this case, you’re dividing 48,488 by 4, so your setup looks like the 
following:
 
 
 
2. Divide the divisor into the first digit or digits larger than the divisor 
and write the quotient above the digit.
 
 If the divisor is too big to go into only the first digit, try the first two digits. 
For this example, the digit must be 4 or greater or it won’t fit. If the first digit 
were 3, the divisor (4) wouldn’t fit, and you’d divide into the first two digits.
 
 
 
3. Repeat Step 2 for the remaining digits.
 
 Here’s what that looks like for the second digit and the completed problem:
 
 
 
 
 
 That’s it! The answer is 12,111 ounces per carboy.
Simple short division turns more complex
Sometimes, your short division doesn’t come out as neatly and remainder-
free as you may want. Check out the following twist on the example from 
the preceding section to see how you can use short division to tackle more 
complicated problems.
 
You have four carboys to store 972 ounces of sulfuric acid in. You follow much 
the same process as the problem in the preceding section does, but you have 
to account for remainders.
 
1. Divide the divisor into the first digit where it fits.
 
 The first digit is 9. The divisor 4 goes into 9 two times, but with 1 left 
over. Write a 2 above the 9 in the quotient area, and put a little 1 to the 
right of the nine. That’s the remainder.
 
 
 
2. Divide into the second digit, using any remainder from the previous 
step as a tens digit.

71
 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
 
 The remainder of 1 and the second digit of 7 make 17. Four goes into 17 
four times (4 × 4 = 16) with a new remainder of 1, which you record to 
the right of the second digit.
 
 
 
3. Repeat Step 2 for the remaining digits.
 
 The remainder of 1 and the third digit of 2 make 12.
 
 
 
 In this case, your answer has come out even, so you’re done. The 
answer is 243.
 
 If the result doesn’t come out even, you have a remainder, which you 
note next to the quotient. For example, if you divide 4 into 973, the result 
is 243 with a remainder of 1.
 
 
Going long (division)
Short division (see the preceding sections) is useful for simpler problems, and 
a calculator is helpful for really complex (or “hairy,” to use a professional term) 
problems.
But in the middle is long division, which some claim is the path to spiritual 
fulfillment. Real men and women know how to do long division. They have 
confidence and more fulfilling lives (or so we hear). Long division is excel-
lent for long numbers, both in the dividends and/or the divisors, because it 
breaks the problem down into very clear steps.
 
Keep your work neat and organized. It makes a difference, especially if you 
have to go back and dissect the work to find an error.
Follow these steps to perform long division:
 
1. Write the dividend and divisor in the tableau.
 
 Say you want to tackle the problem 24,432 ÷ 16. For long division, write 
the problem like this:
 
 
 
2. Divide the divisor into the first digits where it fits.
 
 If the divisor is too big to go into only the first digit, try the first two 
digits. In this example, 16 doesn’t fit into 2, the first digit, but it does fit 

72
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
into 24, the first two digits. Write the quotient above the digits, placing it 
over the last digit you went into.
 
 
 
3. Multiply the quotient from Step 2 by the divisor, write the product 
below the first two digits of the dividend, and then subtract.
 
 Here, 1 times 16 is 16, so record that below the 24 in the dividend. 24 
minus 16 gives you a remainder of 8.
 
 Instead of recording a tiny 8 in the dividend as you do in short division, 
just leave the remainder where it is. This method takes up more space, 
but that’s why it’s called long division.
 
 
 
4. Bring down the next digit from the dividend and place it next to the 
remainder from Step 3; divide the divisor into this new number, writ-
ing the answer in the quotient area.
 
 The next number in the dividend is 4, so pull that down next to the 
remainder 8 from Step 3 to make 84. Divide 84 by 16 and put the answer, 
5, in the quotient, above the digit you dropped down. You now have 15 
in the quotient area.
 
 
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you can’t divide into the dividend any more.
 
 Here’s what your final setup for this example looks like:
 
 
 
 The answer is 1,527.

73
 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
 
 This example is a simple division problem, with no remainders. If 
your problem doesn’t come out evenly, just note the remainder next 
to the quotient. If you need a more precise answer, simply extend 
the dividend with a decimal point and one or more zeroes and keep 
on dividing.
 
Smaller dividends take less time. Larger dividends take more time. If you start 
dividing numbers like 5,439,242 by numbers like 649, pull out the calculator. 
(But do be careful. Some calculators can only handle numbers so big and may 
give you an error message if the numbers are too large.
Checking your work
To check a quotient in division (where else would you find quotients?), mul-
tiply the quotient by the divisor; if you’ve solved the problem correctly, this 
check returns the dividend.
For example, if you do the problem 12 ÷ 3 = 4 and you want to check the 
work, multiply 4, the quotient, by 3, the divisor. The result is 12, your original 
dividend. To check the problem from the long division section earlier in the 
chapter, multiply 16 by 1,527:
16 × 1,527 = 24,432
Shortcuts: Dividing into 0 and 
by 0, 1, 10, and the dividend
Like multiplication, division offers a few scenarios that can make your life (or 
at least your math) a little easier. Check your problem for
 
✓ A dividend of 0
 
✓ A divisor of 0
 
✓ A divisor of 1 or of the dividend itself
 
✓ A divisor of 10
Dividing into 0
Zero divided by anything is zero. Stop working. That’s the answer.
Dividing by 0
The rule is simple: Never divide by zero. Never. You can’t. Dividing by zero is 
a mathematical impossibility. It’s a waste of time, and it annoys the zero.

74
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Dividing by 1 or the dividend
As with multiplication, dividing by 1 is simple. Any number divided by 1 is 
equal to (get ready) itself. Stop working. That’s the answer. Similarly, any 
number divided by itself is 1.
Dividing by 10
If you’re dividing 10 into a dividend, just move the decimal point one place to 
the left. For example, 5,450 ÷ 10 = 545.
 
This concept works for dividing by 100 as well. Divide by 100 by moving the 
decimal point two places to the left: 67,400 ÷ 100 = 674.
Example: In the Machine Shop
 
Old lathes can be driven by belts. If a pulley makes 4,522 revolutions in 34 min-
utes, how many revolutions does it make in 1 minute? You know how many 
revolutions the pulley makes in 34 minutes, so just divide that number by 34. 
Set it up as a long division problem.
 
1. Put the numbers from the problem into the tableau.
 
 Your dividend is 4,522, and your divisor is 34.
 
 
 
2. Divide the divisor (34) into the first digits where it fits.
 
 It doesn’t fit into 4, the first digit, but it does fit into the first two digits, 
45. Write the quotient above the digits.
 
 
 
3. Multiply the quotient (1) by 34 and write it below the first two digits 
(45); then subtract.
 
 

75
 Chapter 5: Multiplication and Division: Everybody Needs Them
 
4. Bring down the next digit (2); divide 34 into 112 and write the answer 
above the tableau.
 
 You now have 13 in the quotient area.
 
 
 
5. Multiply the quotient (3) by 34 and write it below the 112; subtract 
(leaving a remainder of 10) and bring down the next digit (2).
 
 Now you have a divisor of 102.
 
 
 
6. Divide 34 into 102 and write the result (3) in the quotient area; subtract.
 
 You have no remainder, so you’re done.
 
 
The answer is 133 revolutions per minute.

Measurement and Conversion
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying measurement systems
▶ Converting from one kind of unit to another
I
n the early history of civilization, measuring things was probably a key 
building block helping people move from a nomadic life to one based on 
farming and living in villages. Common questions then no doubt included 
things like: “How long is it?” “How much does it weigh?” “What is its volume?” 
and “What is its area?”
Today people still need answers to the same questions. For example, car-
penters, roofers, masons, cabinet makers, and painters use measurements 
of length (feet and inches) extensively. Chefs and cosmetologists use volume 
measurements (fluid ounces and cups). Lab assistants use weights and vol-
umes in the metric system (kilograms and liters).
The units for measuring things have helped civilization from its start. They 
have also plagued each civilization when it traded with the civilization next 
door and the units of measurement didn’t agree. This problem still exists 
today because two major systems are in use. Some of these units may be 
plaguing you now. But not to worry. Having two measurement systems isn’t 
a problem when you see how it all works.
In this chapter, you identify the different systems of measurement and see 
the most common units. Then you review how to convert from one unit to 
another, whether the units are in the same or different systems.
Main (And Not So Main) 
Systems of Measurement
Today you commonly use two systems of measurement: the American 
system and the metric system. The American system is also called the 

78
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
United States customary system. The metric system is now known as the 
International System of Units (abbreviated SI), though we refer to it here as 
the metric system.
These aren’t the only systems of measurement, however. Many countries all 
over the world have official systems of measurement, some of which go back 
thousands of years. These are customary systems, like the United States cus-
tomary system, but those systems have been almost universally overtaken 
by metric.
Some minor systems of measurement are important, but only in a very lim-
ited number of careers.
In some cases, your work requires knowledge of only one system. For exam-
ple, science and medicine use the metric system almost exclusively, while the 
construction trades and culinary arts use the American system extensively. 
Stay alert, though: The American system is a tradition, but metric measure-
ment is gradually becoming more widely used in the United States.
 
✓ In photography, you use millimeters (mm) to specify lens focal length.
 
✓ In heating/cooling (HVAC), the Joule is likely to replace the British ther-
mal unit (BTU).
 
✓ In nutrition, the kilojoule (kJ) will probably replace the kilocalorie (kcal 
or Cal).
 
✓ In cooking, you want to get familiar with kilograms and liters if you want 
to cook in the United Kingdom or Europe.
 
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, says, “In keeping with the Omnibus Trade 
and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the ultimate objective is to make the 
International System of Units the primary measurement system used in the 
United States.” Here’s a new word to impress your friends: The process of 
introducing the metric system to the United States is called metrication.
The metric system
The official name may be the International System of Units (SI), but you com-
monly refer to it as the metric system. It’s based on a unit of length called the 
meter.
The metric system is a decimalized system. That means each larger unit 
of length, area, volume, or mass (weight) is ten times the size of the previ-
ous smaller unit. For example, there are names for 1 meter, 10 meters, 100 
meters, and 1,000 meters: meter, decameter, hectometer, and kilometer. You 
know the last one — it’s the same kilometer you see on road signs.

79
 Chapter 6: Measurement and Conversion
 
In 1791, the French Academy of Sciences defined the meter (or metre, as much 
of the world spells it) as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to 
the north pole through Paris. In 1983, the General Conference on Weights and 
Measures redefined the meter as the length of the path travelled by light in 
vacuum during a time interval of
of a second. You’ll surely sleep better at night for knowing.
So whether you prefer meter or metre, it’s still the same thing. It’s just a little 
more than a yard long (1 meter ≈ 39.37 inches — see the following section). 
That little squiggle (≈) means approximately. That’s about the height of a 
parking meter on a city street, but that has nothing to do how the meter was 
named. Sources say the word is from Greek, meaning a measure.
 
For a long time, the metric temperature scale was called the centigrade scale — 
with water freezing at 0 degrees centigrade and boiling at 100. Then they named 
it after Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer. But this system didn’t account 
for absolute zero — the lowest temperature theoretically possible — so now 
0 kelvin (0 K) is defined as –273.15 degrees Celsius, or absolute 0. However, 
when you drive by a bank with an electric sign, you see degrees Fahrenheit (the 
American temperature unit) and degrees Celsius, but not kelvin.
In time measurement, a second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the 
radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of 
the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.
The big advantage in using metric units (aside from most of the world using 
them) is that most of the conversions are multiples of 10. Now is that easy 
math, or what?
The American system
The United States is the only industrialized nation that doesn’t use metric for 
standard activities. Burma (Myanmar), Liberia, and the U.S. are the only coun-
tries that haven’t adopted metric. Instead, the U.S. uses the American system.
The American system is sometimes called the English system, or its units are 
called English units. It dates back to colonial days. In the United Kingdom, on 
the other hand, the English system evolved to become the imperial system 
(see the section on the imperial system later in this chapter). The American 
system is similar, but not identical, to the imperial system.
Table 6-1 shows you how American units roughly compare to metric units. 
They aren’t exact matches, but you can see which American units have simi-
lar metric counterparts.

The American pound is also known as avoirdupois weight, as opposed to the 
troy pound (see “Troy weight: Just for bullets and bullion”) or the apothecaries’ 
pound (see “Apothecaries’ system: Not a grain of value any more” in this chap-
ter). The key to distinguishing the American weight unit is that avoirdupois 
has 16 ounces in 1 pound. The others don’t.
For information on how to convert between the metric and American systems, 
see “Converting Length, Weight, and Volume” later in this chapter.
The imperial system, or the modern 
English system
The imperial system and imperial units are still common in the United 
Kingdom, which transitioned to the metric system legally in 1995 but still has 
many imperial units in use.
The U.K. Department for Business, Innovation and Skills decrees that draft 
beer and cider must be sold in pints or half pints. (However, gin, rum, 
whiskey, and vodka should be in sold in multiples of 25 or 35 milliliters and 
glasses of wine in 125 milliliter portions.)
Road sign distances and speed limits have to be expressed as imperial units. 
You find similar situations in Ireland and Canada, where people are permitted 
or even required to use some imperial units. You also find some imperial units 
in use in former British territories: Australia, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, 
South Africa, and Hong Kong.
Just remember that many but not all American units are identical to imperial 
units.

Troy weight: Just for bullets and bullion
Troy weight is a system for measuring weight (mass). It’s still very much 
alive, but it’s used mainly for weighting precious metals and reloading rifle 
and pistol cartridges. Its units are
 
✓ Grain
 
✓ Pennyweight
 
✓ Ounce troy
 
✓ Pound troy
The unit grain is the same in avoirdupois, troy, and apothecaries’ weight.
Propellant (powder) for firearms is still weighed in grains but is sold by the 
avoirdupois pound. Bullets are identified by their weight in grains but are 
sold in packages with a specific quantity.
Unlike the American avoirdupois pound, which has 16 ounces, troy weight 
has 12 ounces to its pound. It’s a smaller pound than an avoirdupois pound.
A carat is a unit of weight for a gemstone. It is equivalent to 200 milligrams 
(mg) or  gram (g). Also, in the world of jewelry, you can divide a carat into 
100 points. So, if someone gives you a 5-point diamond, there has to be a lot 
of love, because there isn’t much diamond.
 
Don’t get carat confused with karat (k), which is a measure of the purity of 
gold or silver, as in 14-karat gold.
Apothecaries’ system: Not a grain 
of value any more
Apothecaries’ weight is very similar to troy weight (the grain and the pound 
are the same, with each kind of pound containing 5,760 grains) and is rarely 
used. It is an old system for apothacaries (pharmacists) and scientists.
The units of the apothecaries’ system are:
 
✓ Grain
 
✓ Scruple
 
✓ Dram
 
✓ Ounce apothecaries
 
✓ Pound apothecaries

83
 Chapter 6: Measurement and Conversion
 
Apothecaries’ grains are still used occasionally in medical prescriptions. 
Although most dosages are in milligrams (mg), some items may still be sold 
in grains (gr).
A pound apothecaries has 12 ounces. It’s a smaller pound than an avoirdupois 
(American) pound, which has 16 ounces, but the same weight as a pound troy.
Other legitimate but specialized 
measurements
As long as there are many things to measure, there will be many units of 
measurement. Over the centuries, systems developed as the trades or sci-
ence required them.
Some of these systems seem to be passing into obsolescence, but as the 
world changes and technology evolves, new systems come into existence:
 
✓ Writing paper: In the world of the printing press, the following units 
evolved:
 
• Sheet
 
• Quire
 
• Ream
 
• Bundle
 
• Bale
 
 You often buy printer paper at the office supply store by the ream. If you 
buy a case of ten reams, you’ve also bought a bale.
 
✓ Light-years and parsecs: In the world of astronomy, you measure large 
distances, such as the distances to stars. A light-year is the distance that 
light travels in a year. And since light travels very fast (299,792,458 meters 
What is a grain, anyway?
Way back when, traders used wheat or barley 
grains to define weight. They also used the 
carob seed (which is where you get carat 
weight of gemstones). In the 13th century, King 
Henry III of England declared that an English 
penny was to be equal to 32 grains of wheat. 
The grain is the same in avoirdupois, troy, and 
apothecaries’ weight.

84
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
per second), that’s a big distance. It’s about 5,878,630,000,000 miles or 
exactly 9,460,730,472,580.8 kilometers. A parsec is a unit of length equal to 
about 3.26 light-years. The star nearest the earth (not counting the sun) 
is 1.29 parsecs away.
 
✓ Wine containers: As time marches on, some units do not march on. 
For example, English units of wine cask capacity have pretty much dis-
appeared, so bid farewell to the rundlet, the tierce, the hogshead, the 
firkin, the puncheon, the tertian, the pipe, the butt, and the tun. They 
were once common units but have been overtaken by changing times.
 
✓ Board feet: Carpenters in the United States and Canada commonly use 
the board foot to order lumber. BF is the most common abbreviation, but 
some say the abbreviation is FBM, for “foot, board measure.” A board foot 
is a volume measurement equal to a 1-inch-thick board 12 inches wide 
and 1 foot long. That’s 1 “linear foot” of a 1 x 12. You also express that 
as 12 inches x 12 inches x 1 inch. It amounts to 144 cubic inches.
 
 Even though 1 x 12 boards are no longer 1 inch thick or 12 inches wide, 
those dimensions are still used in calculating board feet. The calculation 
uses the nominal width and thickness. The unit applies to other lumber 
as well. For example, an 8-foot-long 2 x 4 contains 2 x 4 x 96 cubic inches, 
or 768 in3, or 5.333 board feet.
 
✓ Pressure: Pressure is the force applied to a unit of area. The metric unit 
for pressure is the pascal (Pa), formerly Newton per square meter (N/
m2). In the American system, the unit for pressure is pounds per square 
inch (psi). Pressure measurement is important when working with water 
supplies, welding gases, and medical gases.
 
✓ Flow: Flow is the measurement of a fluid. That usually means a liquid, 
but fluid can also mean air or other gases. You measure flow with flow-
meters. It’s important when working with water supplies, including drill-
ing water wells. For well drillers, gallons per minute (gpm) is the most 
critical and common unit of flow used.
 
✓ Electricity: The symbol for power in equations is P, but electricians use 
the unit watt, which is shorthand for electrical power in watts. It’s the 
rate at which energy is generated and consumed. Residential, commer-
cial, and industrial electricians use units such the watt (W), the ampere 
(A, also known as the amp), and the volt (V) every day.
 
 Power electricians install and maintain power generators, converters, 
transformers, and distribution networks. Electricians are multital-
ented constructors. They read blueprints, install tubes (conduit) in the 
walls, install boxes to hold switches and outlets, and pull the wires. At 
the same time, electricians knows how to do the math to deliver the 
expected power to each part of the structure, and the safety require-
ments for keeping the installation safe.

 Chapter 6: Measurement and Conversion
Converting Length, Weight, and Volume
In some careers, you probably can’t do a day’s work without converting a 
number from one unit to another. For example, a framing carpenter constantly 
converts feet to inches and inches to feet in order to make cuts. A concrete 
pourer calculates square feet for a slab’s area, calculates cubic feet of the pour, 
and then converts to cubic yards to know how much concrete is required.
Converting units isn’t hard. You just need to know the tricks and then prac-
tice a little bit.
The rules of conversion
To convert from one unit to another, keep three things in mind:
 
✓ Know the formula.
 
✓ Use identical units.
 
✓ Use the right conversion tools.
Know the formula
You can almost always find a formula on the Internet or in a book to convert 
from one unit to another. However, many formulas are so simple that you 
probably have them memorized.
 
✓ A foot has 12 inches.
 
✓ A yard has 3 feet.
 
✓ A mile has 5,280 feet.
If you grew up with the American system, you probably find this conversion 
especially easy, even though the units aren’t so easy.
It’s only slightly more of a challenge to convert from American to metric or 
metric to American, but between tables of conversion, formulas, and your 
memory, you should have no problem.
Use identical units: Don’t add feet to furlongs!
When you see math with different units, that’s a sign that you need to do 
some conversion. You can’t directly add inches to miles or feet to furlongs. 
You need to convert to the same units before doing the math.

86
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Sometimes the dimensions or quantities are accurate but very inconvenient. You 
need to convert. For example, here’s a small patio that needs a concrete pour:
3 yards × 108 inches = ? square feet
This multiplication isn’t going to work. You can’t multiply yards by inches 
and get square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle, which you prob-
ably remember from elementary school, is
a = l × w
Length times width equals area. But the units have to be the same. For the 
patio, that formula should be:
a (in square feet) = l (in feet) × w (in feet)
The units (feet) are the same, and the result (square feet) will be correct. You 
know that 1 yard is 3 feet long, so convert 3 yards to get 9 feet You know that 
1 foot contains 12 inches, so divide 108 inches by 12 to get 9 feet. The following 
shows the new equation, now that you’ve converted 3 yards and 108 inches:
9 feet × 9 feet = ? square feet
Now you can easily multiply to get the answer in square feet.
Use the right conversion tools
Conversion is faster and more accurate if you use the right tools, which may 
be tables, a calculator, pencil and paper, or the math stored in your brain. 
Here’s the story of Goldilocks and the Three Conversion Problems:
 
✓ The first problem was too complex. Goldilocks had to combine small 
metric volumes of reagents with larger American volumes of water to 
create three jugs of solution for a home urine test. Goldilocks used a 
table of conversions and a calculator.
 
✓ The second problem was too simple. Goldilocks had to cut a 3-foot piece 
of plywood into 9-inch strips. She did the math in her head, converting 3 
feet into 36 inches and dividing by 9. She cut four strips.
 
✓ The third problem was just right. Goldilocks had to combine several 
fluid ingredients in a lab. They were measured in milliliters and liters. 
She knew how to convert (1,000 milliliters = 1 liter), but she wrote the 
items down and added them manually.
American units to American units
When you work with American units, you encounter many different unusual 
equivalents. However, converting from one unit to another isn’t hard to do. 

87
 Chapter 6: Measurement and Conversion
Whether the conversion involves a relatively simple number (for example, 
1 yard is equal to 3 feet) or a more complex-looking number (for example 
1 mile is equal to 5,280 feet), you use conversion factors to get the job done.
Length and distance
The general way to do any conversion is as follows:
Given Unit × Conversion Factor = Desired Unit
The number of inches in a foot is a basic conversion factor:
1 foot = 12 inches
To do a conversion, write the conversion factor as a fraction. You can write it 
two ways. They are equivalent and are both correct.
Use the first fraction
to convert inches to feet. To convert 36 inches to feet:
Notice how the inches in the top and bottom cancel each other out. You are 
left with feet. This conversion is actually division; it’s just shown as multiplying 
by the inverse (check out Chapter 8 for more about working with fractions).
You can also do the math this way:
36 inches ÷ 12 inches in a foot = 3 feet
Use the second fraction 
to convert feet to inches. To convert 3 feet to inches:
Notice how the feet in the top and bottom cancel each other out. You are left 
with inches. This conversion is multiplication.

88
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
If you get outrageous results, that’s a check that tells you that you multiplied 
or divided the wrong way.
Weight (mass)
Converting units of weight is identical to converting units of length.
Given Unit × Conversion Factor = Desired Unit
One of the most common weight conversions is from ounces to pounds. Another 
common conversion is the inverse, where you convert from pounds to ounces.
16 ounces = 1 pound 
1 pound = 16 ounces
The scale in a doctor’s office usually weighs adults to within about a quarter 
of a pound. A typical weight for an adult woman is 
No conversion is required. But if you measure the weight of an infant as 
142 ounces, you need to convert.
To convert this figure to pounds and ounces, apply the conversion factor 
16 ounces = 1 pound.
That’s mathematically correct, but you can’t tell mom and dad that the baby 
weighs 
pounds. The calculator result is 8.875 pounds, which is mathematically cor-
rect, but again, that’s not the easiest result for the parents to understand.
So continue the conversion. Divide 142 by 16, but leave a remainder:
The answer is 8 pounds, with 
of a pound remaining. That’s 14 ounces, so the plain English answer is that 
baby weighs 8 pounds, 14 ounces.

89
 Chapter 6: Measurement and Conversion
If you work in a doctor’s office, you may use a body mass index (BMI) meter to 
get a sense of whether a patient is obese or not. The meter does the work for 
you. However, it does ask for the patient’s height and weight. Depending how 
you’ve set up the meter, you can enter American units or metric units. You can 
also find BMI calculators on the Internet.
 
What is mass, anyway? Aren’t you talking about weight? Yes and no. Put on 
your Full Baffle Protector: Mass is an intrinsic property of matter, whereas 
weight is a force that results from the action of gravity. That doesn’t mean 
much on Earth. A mass of 100 pounds has a weight of 100 pounds. On the 
moon, however, the same mass weighs 16.666 pounds (since the moon’s grav-
 
ity is about  of Earth’s gravity). If you plan to stay on Earth, you can treat 
 
mass and weight as the same thing.
Volume
If you’ve read the preceding sections, it’s probably occurred to you that con-
verting units of volume is identical to converting units of length and weight.
Given Unit × Conversion Factor = Desired Unit
For example, if you know these conversion factors:
2 pints = 1 quart 
4 quarts = 1 gallon
you can calculate the number of pints in a gallon. This conversion isn’t trivial 
when you are creating institutional meals for hospitals and school food services.
The answer is 8 pints per gallon.
But wait! There are 16 fluid ounces in a pint. How many fluid ounces are in a 
gallon?
Just put in another conversion factor, 
. The answer is that 
there are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon.
American to metric and back again
Metric units appear more often and in more places. From time to time, you 
need to convert from U.S. customary units to metric or from metric to U.S. 
customary units.

90
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
You get a little informal help with this just by looking at common occur-
rences in everyday life. Dietary information on food is shown in metric. 
A 12-ounce can of soda also has 355 mL printed on it. Even measuring cups 
in your kitchen have both U.S. and metric units on them.
Length and distance
The conversion factor for feet to meters is
1 foot = 0.3048 meters
As an example, a person 6 feet tall is 1.83 meters tall.
Inches are sometimes more useful than feet. The conversion factor for 
meters to is
0.0254 meters = 1 inch
As an example, an 84-inch doorframe is 2.13 meters high.
You may want to convert miles to kilometers or kilometers to miles when you 
drive. The conversion factor for miles to kilometers is
1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers
The conversion factor for kilometers to miles is
1 kilometer = 0.6213712 miles
Weight (mass)
How much do you weigh in kilograms? The conversion factor for pounds to 
kilograms is
1 pound = 0.454 kilograms
The conversion factor for kilograms to is
1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds
Volume
In the U.S., gasoline is sold by the gallon, but in many countries it’s sold by 
the liter.
The conversion factor for gallons to liters is
1 gallon = 3.785 liters

91
 Chapter 6: Measurement and Conversion
The conversion factor for liters to gallons is
1 liter = 0.264 gallons
Converting metric to metric
Metric-to-metric conversions are probably the easiest ones to make. Add one 
or more zeroes to multiply. Remove one or more zeroes to divide. And every 
unit is a multiple of another unit.
Length and distance
How many meters are in a kilometer? The answer is in the definition: The 
prefix kilo is from Greek, and it means 1,000.
1,000 meters = 1 kilometer
The kilometer isn’t used widely yet in the United States, but it’s appearing 
on road signs, next to the mile numbers. The United States and United 
Kingdom are the only developed nations that still use miles on road signs.
 
You can say kill-o-meter or kill-om-etter. They’re both okay. The second 
pronunciation is consistent with barometer, thermometer, tachometer, 
and speedometer.
Weight (mass)
The simple answer about weight conversions in metric is the same as the 
answer for length and distance. The answer is in the definition.
How many grams are in a kilogram?
1,000 grams = 1 kilogram
With medications, the milligram (mg) and the microgram (mcg) are common.
1,000 milligrams = 1 gram
1,000 micrograms = 1 milligram
The prefix milli- indicates that a gram contains 1,000 milligrams. Unlike 
kilo, it’s not a multiple. Because it’s smaller than the base unit, it’s called 
a submultiple.

92
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
Volume
Please don’t enter a persistent vegetative state. There is one more metric truth 
to share. How many milliliters are in a liter? The answer is — again — in the 
definition:
1,000 milliliters = 1 liter
Example: Don’t Get Bored by Board Feet
 
You work for a fencing contractor. The boss asks you to order 240 8-foot 4 x 4 
fence posts. How many board feet is that? You know that a board foot is 144 
cubic inches.
1 board foot = 1 inch × 12 inches × 12 inches = 144 cubic inches
 
1. Convert the 8-foot dimension to inches, so all units for the 4 x 4 are 
in inches.
 
 
 
2. Multiply thickness, width, and length to get the volume of a single 4 x 4.
 
 4 inches × 4 inches × 96 inches = 1,536 cubic inches
 
3. Multiply by the number of 4 x 4s you need to buy.
 
 1,536 cubic inches × 240 = 368,640 cubic inches
 
4. Divide by the conversion factor (1 board foot = 144 cubic inches) to 
get the result in board feet.
 
 The result is the total volume in cubic inches.
 
 
The answer is 2,560 board feet. Whether the lumberyard sells in board feet or 
per each, that’s going to be a serious investment in fence posts.

 Chapter 6: Measurement and Conversion
Example: Getting the Dosage Right
 
This example is drawn from actual nursing experience. You are to give “gr 5 
FeSO4 [iron sulfate]” but the bottle contains 325-milligram tablets of iron sulfate. 
How many milligrams is the order for?
You look up grains in an apothacaries’ weight table and find that 1 gram 
equals 15.432 grains.
 
1. Convert the 5 grains into grams.
 
 
 
2. Convert the grams into milligrams.
 
 A milligram is

The answer is 324 milligrams, which is almost exactly equal to the 325-
milligram tablets in the bottle.

Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing what story problems are and why they exist
▶ Finding the keywords in story problems
▶ Using shortcuts to solve story problems
You encounter story problems every day. They appear in two major 
places: math tests and your work. You can avoid story problems in math 
tests by completing all the math classes you need for an education in your 
career, but you can’t avoid story problems that arise in your everyday work.
Very few problems come with a formula attached; instead, they come with 
words attached. For example, if you have a recipe for one pie and want to 
enough pies to serve 100 people, it’s up to you to calculate the number 
of servings in one pie to, figure out the number of pies you need and then 
convert the recipe into the right amounts of ingredients. It doesn’t matter 
whether you’re the boss or just the apprentice baker — the problem will lie 
there until you solve it.
Story problems are disconcerting to people, making them break out in a 
cold sweat, make groaning noises, and sometimes curl up into a ball. We 
researched this effect, and we find almost 100-percent agreement. People 
seem to fear and loathe story problems.
In the past, you may have heard story problems called word problems or life 
problems, and the reaction was worse. Don’t hyperventilate. Story problems 
are “real-life” problems, and they aren’t hard to solve. You can slay the biggest 
fire-breathing story problem dragon if you have a big enough fire extinguisher 
to douse the flames. Then it just takes a penknife (or a ballpoint pen) to finish 
it off.
In this chapter, you look at what’s inside a story problem and discover a 
series of steps (such as finding the keywords) that make just about any story 
problem solvable.

Removing the Mystery 
from Story Problems
Story problems come in many flavors. The classic ones are money or invest-
ment problems, distance/speed/time problems, and age problems (“How old 
will John be when he’s half Mary’s age?”).
The point (and the good news) is that most classic types of story problems 
aren’t important to your work. In the trades, you’re far more likely to encounter 
area, perimeter, or volume problems; combining or separating mixture prob-
lems; and/or number or weight problems.
Identify the types of story problems you’re faced with and practice solving 
those types. In yoga, martial arts, and story problems, practice is a compo-
nent of success. The more story problems you solve successfully, the greater 
your confidence in solving new ones.
 
The promise of a career with limited types of story problems doesn’t guarantee 
an education with limited types. While preparing for any career, vocation, or 
trade, you may encounter math courses with story problems that don’t apply 
to your work — anything from problems about “Betty’s age” to “two trains 
leave a station, going in opposite directions.” Stay alert and you won’t get hurt!
The illusion of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat is mystifying — until 
you know the trick. The same is true with story problems. They appear con-
fusing, until you know the trick of how to approach them. Lucky for you, we 
discuss that topic in the following section.
How to approach a story problem: 
A real-life example
 
Here’s an irony of life. Story problems on a math test give you all the informa-
tion you need but are designed to contain some mystery. Story problems in 
real life aren’t supposed to be mysterious, but sometimes they don’t have all 
the information. Here’s an example:
You’re a skilled fencing installer. You know materials (wood and steel), con-
crete, and fabrication techniques. Here’s a sample problem:
How many six-foot-high chain-link fence posts spaced ten feet apart do 
you need to fence a one-acre enclosure?

97
 Chapter 7: Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
This example is just about the “perfect storm” of story problems. It has a 
little of everything good or bad you may find in a story problem.
Look for two major symptoms:
 
✓ Too much information: When a story problem has too much informa-
tion, identify that fluff and eliminate it. For example, in the fencing exam-
ple, the object is to figure the number of posts around an enclosure. The 
fact that the posts are six feet high is interesting but not important to 
solving the problem.
 
 As we advise in the step-by-step solving method later in this chapter, be 
sure to read the problem carefully so that you can identify what informa-
tion is pertinent to your needs.
 
✓ Too little information: When a story problem has too little information, 
identify what’s missing and get what missing information you need. 
Sometimes you can convert the information provided, and sometimes 
you have to ask your source for it. In the fencing example, you calculate 
the number of fence posts needed to surround an acre. But the problem 
doesn’t tell you how big around an acre is.
To get off to a brave start, look up the area of an acre: 43,560 square feet. To 
restate the question, what’s the perimeter (“how big around”) of an acre? The 
answer: You don’t know. You can’t know. Even the area info you looked up 
isn’t terribly helpful — any number of dimensions can yield that figure. You 
may have an enclosure 43,560 feet long and one foot wide. That’s a whole lotta 
fence posts. In real life, you have to go back to the source for more information.
 
The smallest rectangle that can enclose an acre is a square with sides of 
208.71 feet. The fence posts in the example would have to be enough to handle 
834.84 feet of perimeter. A circular enclosure would take fewer fence posts 
because it has a perimeter (well, circumference) of 739.86 feet.
 
An American football field is 1.322 acres in area. (Don’t count the end zones.) 
One acre is 75.6 percent of the football field’s area.
Say the fencing enclosure isn’t an acre but rather a rectangle with dimensions 
of 50 feet x 100 feet. The perimeter (the total distance around all four sides) 
is 300 feet, so if the fence posts go in the ground every 10 feet, you need 30 
posts. (Flip to Chapters 15 and 16 for more on perimeters.)
What if it’s not an enclosure? What if it’s a straight run of 100 feet? The 
answer is 10 fence posts, right? Wrong! This scenario is where experience 
counts. You must make allowance for one more post at the start of the run, 
which brings your total to 11 fence posts.

98
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
What if the run (whether straight or an enclosure) isn’t evenly divisible by 10 
feet? What if it’s 94 feet rather than 100 feet? As a practical matter, you can’t 
just install the posts 10 feet apart; the fence will look bad at the end of the run. 
To get the cosmetics right, a professional consults a fence post spacing chart. 
The spacing for a 94 feet run should be 9 feet, 5 inches. Also, as a pro, you 
know what corner posts, end posts, and gate posts are, when you need them, 
and how they affect your figures. Others have to look that information up.
 
In a math test, the problem doesn’t change because of these kinds of consider-
ations. In real life, real life can change the problem.
The secret formula inside 
every story problem
A lot of story problems finally turn into a simple math problems. The initial 
facts may garble the message at first, but when you work them out, the math 
message becomes clear.
Chapter 13 in this book contains detail about formulas. But for now, just 
think of a formula as a rule or principle usually expressed in symbols, not 
words. For example, the formula for the area of a rectangle (“area is equal to 
length multiplied by width”) is A = L × W.
Secret formulas aren’t so secret, except in the movies and on TV. Math for-
mulas are more common, and they work all the time. A story problem con-
verts into a formula. In fact, you may be a little disappointed when you see 
the formula and the mystery disappears. The following sections show you 
how to dig the formula out of a story problem.
Recognizing the real-life factors
Life has a funny way (funny peculiar, not funny har har) of being more com-
plex than made-up problems. (Well, you may make an exception for after-
noon soap operas.) So although math test story problems are designed to 
test one or maybe two math concepts, real-life story problems require you to 
work with multiple math principles.
The answer to one part of a story problem usually leads to one or more story 
problems within the story problem. These multipart story problems require you 
to solve the main part of the problem and then solve other parts on top of that. 
Some people feel like they’re being stabbed with a knife covered with poison. Is 
the multipart story problem really deadly? No, not really. The “deadly” part is 
that there’s simply a second (or third) solving step after the first one.

99
 Chapter 7: Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
Money and labor issues frequently find their way into otherwise simple 
problems. If you’re a fence installer, your math may not end with figuring the 
number of fence posts needed for a fencing run. You expect it to go on to cal-
culate money or labor, and you encounter these factors:
 
✓ The cost of special posts
 
✓ The height of the posts (to determine the height of the fencing fabric)
 
✓ The total cost of the fence and the average cost per running foot
 
✓ The hours needed for installation
 
✓ The number of installers and the overall installation time
Two-part story problems may also ask you to do one of two kinds of 
conversions:
 
✓ Direct conversion: Different portions of the problem are given in differ-
ent units. For example, you usually calculate a volume of concrete to be 
poured based on feet, giving you cubic feet, but the problem may ask 
you to specify how much concrete to order, which is based on cubic 
yards. You usually convert the cubic feet to cubic yards.
 
✓ Indirect conversion: The initial answer is based on one unit but the final 
answer isn’t a simple conversion to another unit. For example, in tiling 
a roof, if you know the area of a roof, you have to convert the roof area 
in square feet area into the number of roof tiles that cover the area. But 
roof tiles overlap, so you do a conversion to allow for overlap. Then you 
convert to order the tiles by count, not area. The final answer isn’t the 
first or second intermediate answer.
Identifying the keywords
Another mystery in story problems comes from the words, which you have 
to turn into math expressions. The idea is to translate from words to math. 
Table 7-1 shows some typical keywords and their probable meanings.
Table 7-1 
Typical Keywords and Their Probable Meanings

The Step-by-Step Story Problem Solution
If you can’t bear the thought of tackling story problems, just think of them as 
puzzles. All you need to conquer a puzzle is a method for solving it, and the 
method for tackling this particular kind is in this section.
 
To succeed with story problems, keep your thoughts and work organized.
The steps in the following sections show you how to clear up story problem 
mysteries in an orderly step-by-step way. Note: We use an example of making 
a big batch of chocolate mousse to illustrate many of the steps, but we offer 
other examples when they show the point of the step better.
1. Read the problem
To redo an old saying, “Don’t just do something. Stand there!” Don’t calculate 
anything at this point. Begin by reading the problem carefully. It’s simple 
and it’s true: You must read the whole problem. Don’t make any marks. Then 
reread the problem so that you understand what answer you need and what 
information you have (steps we cover in later sections).

101
 Chapter 7: Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
Here is a classic example of a (nonmath) problem that people don’t fully read 
before coming up with an answer:
Question: A plane crashes exactly on the border between two states. 
Where do you bury the survivors?
Answer: Half of them in each state? All of them in one state? In a long thin 
line along the border? The answer: nowhere. You don’t bury survivors. In 
this example, your brain gets ahead of your eyes, and you come up with 
an answer (the wrong one) too soon.
2. List the facts
Identify and list the facts. Look at all of the information given in the story 
problem and make a list of what you know. If the problem requests an answer 
(and what problem doesn’t?), you determine exactly what it is in a different 
step. If any of the info is irrelevant, you determine that in a different step.
 
Pretend that you’re an assistant manager in the food service at an upscale 
retirement complex. You serve a lot of meals to a large number of diners. 
You must determine the amounts of the ingredients you need for chocolate 
mousse for 250 guests, based on the following recipe notes:
The ingredients for one batch are as follows:
 
✓ 2 cups heavy cream
 
✓ 4 large egg yolks
 
✓ 3 tablespoons sugar
 
✓ 1 teaspoon vanilla
 
✓ 7 ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate
Nutrition facts: Total fat 32.3 grams, saturated fat 18.5 grams, and cholesterol 
283 milligrams. The mousse goes into eight 6-ounce stemmed glasses and is 
garnished with lightly sweetened whipped cream.
The facts are easy to list:
 
✓ Need 250 servings
 
✓ 2 cups heavy cream
 
✓ 4 large egg yolks

102
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
 
✓ 3 tablespoons sugar
 
✓ 1 teaspoon vanilla
 
✓ 7 ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate
 
✓ Lightly sweetened whipped cream (for garnish)
 
✓ Nutrition elements are total fat 32.3 grams, saturated fat 18.5 grams, and 
cholesterol 283 milligrams
 
✓ Eight 6-ounce stemmed glasses
3. Figure out exactly what the problem 
is asking for
Know what you’re trying to find. The problem often states the required 
answer, but sometimes you have to ferret it out from the information you 
receive. In the recipe example in the preceding section, the answer is clear: 
You have to determine the amount of ingredients required for 250 servings.
4. Eliminate excess information
A problem may have excess information — in fact, some math test problems 
may include extra facts on purpose. For example, you may need to find out 
how many oranges are in Jim’s basket, but the problem may also tell you that 
Jim is wearing a yellow shirt. Too much information! The trouble is that in 
real-life problems, identifying the excess information may be harder.
In the earlier recipe example, eliminate the following irrelevant facts:
 
✓ Lightly sweetened whipped cream (for garnish)
 
✓ Nutrition elements are total fat 32.3 grams, saturated fat 18.5 grams, and

✓ 6-ounce stemmed glasses
Why are these items irrelevant?
 
✓ The sweetened whipped cream garnish isn’t important to the main 
problem, calculating amount of ingredients for the mousse. The recipe 
doesn’t even specify the necessary amount of whipped cream, so you 
can’t calculate the amount you’d need anyway.
 
✓ The nutritional elements are outrageous, but not relevant. Nutrition has 
no bearing on solving the main problem.

 Chapter 7: Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
 
✓ The number of servings in the batch is important, but the size of the 
serving glasses isn’t. You may not fill the full six ounces of each glass, so 
the serving may be any number of ounces.
 
 Important information may be lurking near the junk you don’t need, so be 
vigilant. If you weren’t careful here, you may have thrown out the fact that 
you’re using eight 6-ounce glasses; the ounces may be unimportant, but the 
eight servings per batch is key to figuring out how many batches serve 250.
5. See what information is missing
Determine what information is missing. In a test problem, you can usually 
convert some piece of given information into information you need but don’t 
have. In real life, you may also have to seek out more information.
For example, in commercial housepainting, you easily calculate the square 
footage of walls to be painted, and you also know the number of square feet 
a gallon of paint can cover. But if you don’t know whether to apply one coat 
or two, you calculation of total amount of paint needed may be significantly 
wrong. You can’t do the calculation successfully until you know the missing 
piece of information. In the case of housepainting, you need more informa-
tion about the covering ability of the paint to be used and about the color to 
be painted over.
In the earlier recipe example, the information is complete. You don’t need to find 
more info. You don’t need to convert units either, but beware: Later, as a practi-
cal matter, you convert the answers into units that are familiar to your buyers.
6. Find the keywords
As we note in the earlier section “Identifying the keywords,” story problems 
often contain words that you need to translate into nice, useful math sym-
bols and formulas. (Check out Tables 7-1 and 7-2 in that section for some 
handy translations.) In the recipe problem, the keywords are “determine the 
amounts of ingredients” and “for 250 guests.”
This first phrase tells you that the answer requires some new amount of 
ingredients. This process is called scaling a recipe and asks you to find either 
greater or lesser quantities of ingredients. Scaling asks for addition or multi-
plication when you’re increasing a recipe and subtraction or division when 
you’re decreasing a recipe.
The second phrase tells you that the quantities of ingredients must be cor-
rect for 250 servings. Since the original recipe serves 8, the phrase implies 
that you must multiply to get the amounts needed.

104

7. Pay attention to units
Units make a difference. If an answer requires the results in feet, that’s how 
the answer must appear. Unfortunately, problems sometimes use units that 
aren’t the same as those required for the answer. When that happens, be pre-
pared to convert units. You can use a table of conversions, an online calcula-
tor, or your own memory to get the conversion factors.
For example, if you have a carpet remnant 72 inches wide and 108 inches long, 
you can easily multiply length and width to get the area: 7,776 square inches. 
However, when was the last time you saw carpet measured in square inches? 
Carpets typically come in square feet, so you need to convert the answer.
A square foot contains 144 square inches (because it’s a measure of area 12 
inches in length and 12 inches in width), so divide 7,776 by 144 to get 54 square 
feet. You can also get this answer by converting 72 inches into 6 feet and 108 
inches into 9 feet. When you multiply 6 and 9, you get 54 square feet.
 
When the units used in calculating are different from each other, you convert 
them to the same unit. For example, you can’t add feet to meters. Convert the 
feet to meters or the meters to feet so that you’re doing math with the same unit. 
See Chapter 6 for more on converting units.
8. Convert information supplied 
into information needed
In a perfect world, you get the units you need, but alas, the world isn’t perfect. 
In everyday work, you get mixed units, whether the items involved are quanti-
ties of fence posts, containers of ethyl alcohol, or drums of transmission fluid.
Be prepared to convert the elements of the problem into the units you need. 
Why say “elements?” We’re not talking strictly about units of measure. You 
may also be changing the form of the substances in the problem.
For instance, in a problem about preparing peach compote for a large food 
service, your starting recipe may call for cups of sliced peaches. However, 
your produce supplier may deliver whole fresh peaches by the pound or lug. 
Use your professional skills to determine how many cups of peach slices you 
get from a pound or a lug.
 
The lug is a unit used in agriculture. It’s a box used to hold fruits or vegetables. 
The United States Department of Agriculture defines lugs for peaches as 
22 pounds.

 Chapter 7: Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
9. Draw a diagram
A diagram helps you visualize the problem. For example, a straight 100-foot 
run of chain link fencing with posts set 10 feet apart suggest that you need 
10 fence posts, as we discuss earlier in the chapter. But if you draw a diagram 
(such as the one in Figure 7-1) to verify, you discover that you actually need 
11 posts to cover 100 feet at 10-foot intervals.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Using a 
diagram to 
understand 
a problem.
 
100’ in whole run
10’ between posts
The start of the run needs a post, too!
 
Diagrams are frequently helpful, but they’re not useful for every problem, so 
think of this step as an option, not a requirement.
10. Find or develop a formula
Formulas for converting units (for example, feet to inches or feet to meters) 
are common and necessary. A formula assures you that your reasoning is 
right and may adapt to become the formula you use for solving the problem. 
Although existing boilerplate formulas (such as the one for area) may be 
helpful, what your story problem may need is a formula that deals in that par-
ticular problem’s units or items.
In the earlier mousse recipe example, you want to take the quantities you 
have for eight servings and convert them into the quantities you need for 
250 servings. The following formulas help you do just that:
 
You can generalize these formulas to apply to any conversion of servings.

106
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
11. Consult a reference
If you’re stuck, look for a reference of some kind, such as a conversion chart or 
even a blog where someone has encountered the same problem you’re having.
For example, you may want to use a recipe from the United Kingdom and you 
convert metric units into traditional American units. If you are visiting the 
United Kingdom and cooking for friends, you convert your recipe with tradi-
tional units into metric units.
Look at the following recipe for Indian naan. It has both traditional and 
metric units:
 
✓ 175 milliliters (6 fluid ounces) warm water (45 degrees Celsius)
 
✓ 1 teaspoon dried active baking yeast
 
✓ 1 teaspoon caster sugar
 
✓ 250 grams (9 ounces) plain flour
 
✓ 1 teaspoon salt
 
✓ 4 tablespoons ghee (butter with the milk solids removed)
 
✓ 2 tablespoons plain yogurt
 
✓ 2 teaspoons onion seed
This recipe happens to include a conversion from milliliters to fluid ounces 
and from grams to ounces. The other ingredients are in the familiar units of 
teaspoons and tablespoons.
 
You can also use your experience as a reference. Experienced chefs get 
a sense of exactly how much butter, sugar, and whipping cream a recipe 
requires — they can visualize the quantities from experience. For example, 
after you know that a quarter-pound stick of butter (4 ounces) is equal to 
113.5 grams, you quickly visualize how much butter recipes requiring 90 grams 
are calling for.
12. Do the math and check your answer 
to see whether it’s reasonable
After you have an answer, be sure to check it. If the result is outrageously 
high or low, you made a mistake. In the first recipe example earlier, if the 
chocolate quantity comes out to be 1,750 ounces (over 109 pounds!), you 
probably need to redo the solution. You didn’t divide by 8 to get the quantity 
for a single serving. The correct answer for 250 servings is 218.75 ounces, or 
about 13.67 pounds.

 Chapter 7: Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
Example: Furring Strips
 
As a remodeler, you know that furring strips are 1 inch x 2 inch thin strips of 
wood you use to make a backing surface for a wall covering (for example, 
when you drywall a concrete or concrete block basement). You also know that 
for garage shelves, 2 inch x 2 inch lumber makes a great support for the back 
edge of plywood shelves.
You’re doing a residential remodel and you get a load of lumber. The load 
has 942 pieces but only two items: 1 x 2 furring strips and 2 x 2 boards. 
Furring strips cost $1.25 each and 2 x 2 boards cost $2.50 each. The total bill 
for the load is $1,230.00. How many pieces of each kind of wood do you have? 
Use the process in “The Step-by-Step Story Problem Solution” to figure it out:
 
1. Read and reread the problem.
 
2. Identify things that you know.
 
• Total pieces: 942
 
• Total bill: $1,230.00
 
• Cost of single furring strip: $1.25
 
• Cost of a single 2 x 2 board: $2.50
 
3. Determine what the problem is asking you to find.
 
 The problem clearly states that you want to know how many pieces of 
each kind of lumber are in the load.
 
4. Eliminate any irrelevant information.
 
 It’s a residential remodeling project, but that’s irrelevant to solving the 
problem.
 
5. Identify keywords.
 
• The problem says, “How many pieces of each kind of wood do you 
have?” Because you know the total number of pieces (942), you 
can get the number of the other kind of wood by subtracting when 
you know the number of pieces of one kind of wood.
 
• The problem says, “The total bill for the load is $1,230.00.” You 
add the cost of each kind of lumber together to get the total cost; 
because you know the cost of each kind of wood, you can use 
those numbers to help find the amounts of each kind.
 
6. Make a formula to solve the problem.
 
 Find the cost of the 2 x 2 boards first. You know that each one costs $2.50, 
so write the formula for the total cost of the 2 x 2s as x × 2.50. You’re using 
a variable because you don’t know the exact number of boards yet.

108
Part I: Basic Math, Basic Tools 
 
 Find the cost of the furring strips. You don’t need a new variable; you 
know the total number of boards delivered (942), so just subtract the 
number of 2 x 2 boards (which you already have a variable for: x) 
from 942 to represent the number of furring strips. You can express the 
number of furring strips as 942 – x.
 
 That last part took skill and cleverness. You have expressed the number of 
furring strips in terms of the number of 2 x 2s. Because you know the total 
bill comes from the total amount of lumber, the formula looks like this:
 
 1,230.00 = x × 2.50 + (942 – x) × 1.25
 
7. Do the math to solve the problem.
 
 
 
 The load contains 900 furring strips and 42 2 x 2s.
 
8. Check your work.
 
 Plug your answers in and check the results:
 
 (42 × $2.50) + (900 × $1.25) = $1,230.00
These numbers of boards produce the correct costs to equal the total bill.
Example: And Now, from 
the Banks of the Nile
 
Talk about the curse of the Pharaohs! Story problems go back to at least the 
Second Intermediate Period of Egypt. This problem comes from a scribe 
named Ahmes writing in about 1600 BC. Cue the spooky, exotic music:
There are seven houses; in each house there are seven cats; each cat kills 
seven mice; each mouse has eaten seven grains of barley; each grain would 
have produced seven hekat (an Egyptian unit of grain volume). What is the 
sum of all the enumerated things?

109
 Chapter 7: Slaying the Story Problem Dragon
No surprises in this problem: Reading and examining the problem is 
straightforward.
 
1. Count the houses.
 
 The problem itself tells you there are seven houses, so that’s easy.
 
2. Determine the number of cats.
 
 If seven houses each have seven cats, multiply to get the number 
of cats.
 
 7 × 7 = 49 cats
 
3. Compute the number of mice, grains, and hekats.
 
 If each cat kills seven mice, multiply to get the number of mice. Do the 
same for grains and hekats.
 
 7 × 7 × 7 = 343 mice
 
 7 × 7× 7 × 7 = 2,401 grains
 
 7 × 7× 7 × 7 × 7 = 16,807 hekats
 
4. Add up the houses, cats, mice, grains, and hekats.
 
 Add 7 + 49 + 343 + 2,401 + 16,807. The answer is 19,607 items.

Fun with Fractions
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying parts of a fraction
▶ Deconstructing fractions — their types, their structures, and some cautions
▶ Performing basic fraction math: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction
You use fractions without even thinking. You even do the math in your 
head. You can say “I’ll meet you at a quarter past three.” That’s a frac-
tion. Or you tell a friend, “I started with a full tank of gas, but now I only have 
3/4 of a tank. I must have used 1/4 tank this afternoon.” That’s using fractions 
and doing math with them.
Fractions are common in technical work. Carpenters, drywallers, chefs, 
landscapers, cosmetologists, roofers, pastry makers, and concrete pourers 
(to name but a few) make measurements all the time, and most of those mea-
surements include fractions.
The framing carpenter tells the apprentice to “make sure those studs are 
925⁄8 inches long.” In the culinary arts (mainly cooking and pastry making), 
measuring and converting fractions are essential. The professional hair color-
ist uses fractions when mixing 10 Volume or 20 Volume peroxide developer 
with different proportions of distilled water to make a 5 volume solution for 
“refreshing” color or doing ends.
Yet some folks get sweaty palms and a chill down the spine when it comes to 
using fractions in math. No need for that! Fractions are friends — commonplace, 
easy to work with, essential for getting work done, and fun to use (well, maybe 
that’s stretching it). To succeed with fractions, you just need to know some frac-
tion terms and practice some fraction math.

In this chapter, you find out the names of the parts of a fraction and some 
names for different kinds of fractions. Then you go on to do simple (but very 
important) fraction math.
Meeting the Numerator and Denominator: 
Best Friends Forever
A fraction is a number that represents parts of a whole. A fraction is also a way 
of showing division (we get into that more in Chapter 9). The following numbers 
are all fractions:
A fraction is made up of two numbers and a line. Sometimes a fraction is 
written like this:
and sometimes it’s written like this:
Here’s a chance to impress your friends! If the line is horizontal, it’s called a 
viniculum. If the line’s slanting (a forward slash), it’s called a solidus.
The top number (or the left number in the second example) is called the numera-
tor. The bottom number (or the right number in the second example) is called 
the denominator. A fraction has to have both a numerator and a denominator. 
They would be lost without each other. They’re best friends forever. Together, 
the numerator and the denominator are called the terms of the fraction.
 
By the way, fraction comes from the Latin verb frangere, meaning to break. It’s 
usually a small number “broken off” from a whole number. It’s also related to 
fracture, as with a broken bone.

115
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
Taking a look at numerators
The numerator can be any number, even a fraction. Think of these numbers 
as though you were cutting up a cake. (It’s a piece of cake.)
For example:
 
✓ 7/8 represents a cake with 8 pieces, and you have 7 of them.
 
 
 
 In Figure 8-1, the shaded portion is 7/8 of the cake.
 
Figure 8-1: 
Cake with 7⁄8 
shaded.
 
How fractions appear in this chapter
Many of the fractions in this chapter appear 
as stacked fractions. A stacked fraction looks 
like this:
 
 
It is written straight up and down.
In your everyday activities, you often see frac-
tions written unstacked or inline. They look like 
this:
 
 1/7
The inline representation of a fraction might be 
convenient for casual writing and some reports, 
but it’s not the best way to represent fractions 
in math operations.

116
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
✓ 0/8 represents a cake with 8 pieces, and you have none of them. A frac-
tion with 0 in the numerator is a legitimate fraction.
 
 
 
 In Figure 8-2, the shaded portion is 0/8 of the cake. No shading! That’s 
nothing. You have zero, nada, nil, cipher, goose egg, bupkis.
 
✓ 1⁄2/8 represents a cake with 8 pieces, and you have 1⁄2 of one piece.
 
 
 
 In Figure 8-3, the shaded portion is 1⁄2/8 of the cake. This must be what 
dieting looks like.
 
✓ 8/8 represents a cake with 8 pieces, and you have all 8 of them.
 
 
 
 In Figure 8-4, the shaded portion is 8/8 of the cake. That’s the whole 
cake, and you’re very lucky — or very greedy.
 
✓ 1/1 represents a cake with 1 piece, and you have the only piece. As with 
8/8, you have the whole cake.
 
 
 
Figure 8-2: 
Cake with 
0⁄8 shaded.
 
 
Figure 8-3: 
Cake with 
1⁄2/8 shaded.
 

117
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
 
 In Figure 8-5, the shaded portion is 1⁄1 of the cake. Now you can tell 
people, “I only took one piece.”
 
✓ 15/8 is a little trickier. It represents a cake with 8 pieces per cake and 
you have 15 pieces. That means the 15 pieces come from more than one 
cake. At first, this may not make a lot of sense, unless you’re a caterer 
with 15 guests to feed.
 
 
 
 In Figure 8-6, the shaded portion is 15/8 of the cake. If no one asks for 
seconds, this setup will serve all 15 guests, with one piece left over.

Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Defining denominators
The denominator can be any number, even a fraction, but with one big excep-
tion. The denominator can never be 0 (zero). You can have one-fifth of some-
thing or one-third of something, but you can’t have one-zeroeth of anything. 
The top number can be 0, but the bottom number can’t because it makes no 
sense, mathematically. Look at these examples of denominators:
 
✓ In the fraction 7/8, 8 is the denominator.
 
 
 
✓ Lab techs may use the fraction 50/1,000 to indicate part of a liter. It rep-
resents 50 milliliters.
 
 
 
✓ Machinists can use 6/1,000 as another way of expressing 6 mils (since a 
mil is 1/1,000 of an inch).
 
 
 
✓ The following example shows a denominator of 1⁄2. Fractions in the 
denominator (as well as the numerator) are allowed, but usually you 
convert the whole fraction to another fraction that’s easier to work with.
 
 
 
Numerators can be anything — but unlike numerators, denominators can 
never be 0.
Dealing with special cases
A denominator of 0 can be called a special case, because it messes up the 
math and isn’t possible. You come across several other special cases in frac-
tion math, though, that aren’t toxic.
Three cases — 1 as the denominator, 0 as the numerator, and the same 
number as both numerator and denominator — are special, because you 
use them all the time to solve math with fractions in the fastest and easiest 
way. The fourth case — fractions representing cents in a dollar — is special 
because transactions involving fractions of dollars are common in business 
and personal finance.

119
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
 
✓ When 1 is the denominator: Any fraction where 1 is the bottom number 
(for example, 34⁄1) is equal to the top number. The 1 is known as the invis-
ible denominator. A math rule: Any number divided by 1 is equal to that 
number.
 
 
 
✓ When 0 is the numerator: Any fraction with 0 as the top number (for 
example, 0⁄17) is equal to zero. If you have 0 parts of something made of 17 
parts, you have 0 parts. A math rule: When any number is divided into 0, 
the result is 0.
 
 
 
✓ When the numerator and the denominator are the same, as in 1/1, 3/3, 
12/12, and so on: A math rule: When any number is divided into itself, 
the result is 1. (These fractions are called equivalent fractions, and you 
find out more about them later in this chapter.)
 
 
 
✓ Dollars and cents: You know that 100 cents make up one U.S. dollar (and 
about sixty other countries in the world also divide their currency into 
cents). You also know that a cent (a penny) is 1/100 of a dollar. If you 
have 37 cents in your pocket, you have 37/100 of a dollar. Currency can 
be expressed as a fraction where the denominator (100) never changes.
 
 
Tackling the Different Types of Fractions
Knowing the names of the different types of fractions is a big help to you in this 
chapter and when doing math in the real world. You even use one of them in 
everyday life. In the following sections, we discuss three concepts in detail:
 
✓ Proper and improper fractions: Fractions have two important and obvi-
ous forms: A proper fraction’s denominator is larger than the numerator, 
and an improper fraction’s denominator is smaller than the numerator. 
(“Honey, does this denominator make my fraction look big?”)
 
✓ Mixed numbers: Whole numbers are from Mars. Fractions are from 
Venus. A mixed number is what you get when you combine them.
 
✓ Ratios: A ratio is a fraction, sort of, much like your Uncle Willie is a relative 
until he misbehaves at Thanksgiving dinner. A ratio shows two numerators 
that add up to be a denominator, which may make them deceiving.

120
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
Does the preceding list cover every type of fraction? Nope! As proof that mathe-
maticians don’t get out much, you may (or may not) want to know that there are 
also unit fractions, dyadic fractions, Egyptian fractions, continued fractions, and 
partial fractions. Some of these are special cases (unit and dyadic), some are 
archaic (Egyptian), and some are used only in higher mathematics (continued 
and partial).
Proper and improper fractions
Proper and improper have nothing to do with good or bad behavior. When a 
fraction has a numerator smaller than its denominator (smaller number on 
top), it’s a proper fraction.
When a fraction has a denominator smaller than its numerator (larger 
number on top), it’s an improper fraction.
So what’s so important about this? When you encounter fractions in your 
work, they will often be part of a mixed number (see the following section). 
You usually convert the mixed number into an improper fraction so that your 
calculations are faster and easier to do. Then after doing the math, you con-
vert the result back into a mixed number. This occurs a lot with carpenters, 
electricians, and workers laying flooring or carpeting.
Mixed numbers
When a whole number and a fraction appear together, such as in 
it’s called a mixed number.
The number represents 2 whole units and 7/8 of another unit.

121
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
 
In various occupations, you find mixed numbers used a lot.
 
✓ A carpenter may cut a piece of plywood to be 243⁄4 inches x 48 inches.
 
✓ A carpetlayer may trim a roll of carpet to fit in a room that is 1111⁄2 
inches wide.
 
✓ An electrician may cut EMT (conduit) to a length of 275⁄8 inches.
A mixed fraction example
 
You have a piece of electrical metal tubing that is 8 feet, 9 inches long. How 
long is that in inches?
The length 8 feet, 9 inches may not appear to be a mixed fraction, but it is. 
The 8 feet is the number of whole feet; the 9 inches is a fraction of a foot. There 
are 12 inches in a foot, so 9 inches is 9/12 of a foot.
To do the conversion, you begin with the following expression:
8 feet 9 inches
The whole unit of feet isn’t useful; you need to convert the units as described 
in Chapter 6. There are 12 inches in a foot. You can convert the whole 
number (8 feet) to inches with this simple expression:
The result is 96 inches. Add that to 9 inches from the problem.
96 inches + 9 inches = 105 inches
The answer is 105 inches.
Another mixed fraction example
 
In a medical office, a person’s height is often measured and recorded in inches 
(for example, 69 inches). Express this height as a mixed number (containing 
feet and inches).
An inch is 1/12 of a foot, so 69 inches is 69/12 of a foot.

122
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Break the fraction into two fractions. Notice that 60⁄12 of a foot easily converts 
to 5 feet. The 9/12 of a foot is 9 inches.
Yet another mixed fraction example
 
You work in industrial or assisted living food service. You have 15  cups of 
 
pecans. You need  cup of pecans to make one dozen muffins. How many 
 
dozens can you make?
Start with the mixed fraction 151⁄2.
Start by turning the whole number into a fraction. How many 1/2 cups are 
in 15 cups? Multiply by 1, but in the form of an equivalent fraction (2/2).
Fifteen cups has 30 half-cups in it. Now add the converted whole number to 
the fraction (1/2).
You have 31 half-cups. Because you need one half-cup to make a dozen muffins, 
you can bake 31 dozen muffins.
Ratios
Fractions are related to ratios. A ratio is a way to compare two quantities 
relative to each other. A ratio is expressed as two numbers separated by a 
colon (:). For example, 3:4.
In a vinaigrette dressing, the classic ratio of oil to vinegar is three parts oil to 
one part vinegar, written as 3:1. You typically describe this as “a 3-to-1 mix-
ture.” This ratio of ingredients is true whether you’re mixing ounces of ingre-
dients at home or gallons in a large cafeteria.
 
A ratio is not as straightforward as a fraction. It describes the parts, but not 
the whole, so don’t automatically trust ratios without understanding what 
they really represent.

123
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
For example, in small two-cycle engines, you want to mix fuel with oil for 
lubrication. Common mix ratios are 12:1, 16:1, 24:1, and 32:1. The ratio 12:1 
tells you to mix 12 parts of gasoline with 1 part of oil. Here, the result is a 
total of 13 parts: 12 of gas and 1 of oil. So the final mix is 12/13 oil and 1/13 
gas. Notice that these fractions are similar, but not identical, to the ratio. By 
using the ratio alone, you end up with the mixture you need, but knowing the 
exact fraction can also be valuable.
The same is true in professional mixology (bartending), where cocktails are 
expressed as ratios as well as whole and fractional quantities. The classic dry 
martini uses 21⁄2 ounces gin and 1/2 ounce dry vermouth. This recipe is a ratio 
of 21⁄2:1/2. Because fractions in ratios are a little clumsy, double both sides of 
the ratio and you get a 5:1 ratio of gin to vermouth.
You can turn ratios into fractions. Consider the cyberdating success ratio 
developed in 2005 by the University of Bath. For every 100 cyberdates (dates 
with people who met online), 94 went on to date each other again and 6 did 
not. This figure is a 94:6 ratio. You can express the proportion of people 
dating again as 94/100 and those not dating again as 6/100.
Performing Math Operations 
with Fractions
Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing regular numbers isn’t hard. 
Why should fractions be any harder? They aren’t. Any difficulties are usually 
with the bottom number, and that’s easy to fix.
Mathematicians use some complicated math processes for fractions (for 
example, the rationalization of monomial and binomial square roots in the 
denominators of fractions), but you aren’t likely to need them in your work. 
There’s nothing vulgar about decimals
The fractions you see in this chapter are called 
vulgar fractions. No, that doesn’t mean they 
have bad manners; you can still take them out 
in public.
Vulgar is from Latin, and just means common, 
ordinary, or everyday. That applies to the frac-
tions that have two numbers separated by a line.
The opposite of a vulgar fraction is a decimal. 
Decimals can be called decimal fractions. 
After all, a number with decimal places shows 
a whole part and a partial part (for example 
3.54). The whole number is, of course, a whole 
number, but the decimal part is a portion (a 
fraction) of a whole number. The number 3.54 
is another form of a mixed fraction.

124
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Most jobs call for the simplest forms of fraction math. (Note: Though addi-
tion and subtraction are typically the most basic math operations, we start 
with multiplication and division here because you actually need those skills 
to add and subtract.)
Multiplying fractions
Multiplying fractions is the easiest of the fraction math operations. Just multi-
ply the numerators and then multiply the denominators.
To solve this problem:
follow these steps:
 
1. Multiply the numerators and the denominators.
 
2. Reduce the result, if you can.
 
 You can divide the top and bottom of 6/24 by 6. This gives you 1/4.
Multiplying a fraction by an equivalent fraction
You can multiply the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same 
number, as long as it’s not 0. A zero in the denominator produces bad, nonsensi-
cal results. You can multiply by an equivalent fraction — that is, a fraction with 
the same number in the numerator and the denominator — because it’s really 
multiplying by 1. As shown in the following example, when multiplying by 3/3 
(which is equal to 1), you simply get a “larger” version of the same fraction.
The new fraction has the same value as the original fraction. Use this opera-
tion whenever you want to make denominators alike.
Multiplying a fraction by 1
In any kind of math problem, when you multiply anything by 1, the result is the 
original quantity. This holds true for fractions as well as for “regular” numbers.

125
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
Multiplying a fraction by 0
When you multiply anything by 0, the result is 0, and that’s true for fractions. 
Notice in the following example that 3/7 is multiplied by 0/1, which is another 
way of writing 0.
This is the same as writing:
Dividing fractions
The hardest operation in fraction math is division. But life is short, so we 
make this operation easy.
In division, what you’re dividing into is the dividend, the number doing the 
dividing is the divisor, and the result is the quotient. With whole numbers, 
8 ÷ 4 = 2. The dividend is 8, 4 is the divisor, and 2 is the quotient.
 
The rule for dividing fractions is to invert the divisor and multiply. Inverting 
just means turning the divisor fraction (the second fraction) upside down. The 
bottom becomes the top and the top becomes the bottom.
Here’s an example:
 
1. Invert the divisor.
 
 2/3 becomes 3/2.
 
 
 
2. Multiply the numerators and the denominators.
 
 When you multiply 4/7 by 3/2, you get 12/14.
 
 
 
3. Reduce the fraction, if you want, by dividing both the top and bottom 
by a common factor.
 
 In the example, the terms can both be evenly divided by 2, which gives 
you 6/7.

126
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
Don’t be taken in by story problems where they ask you to “divide by half.” 
That’s not the same as dividing by 2. For example, 10 divided by half is 10 ÷ 
1/2 and the answer is 20. 10 ÷ 2 is 5.
Reducing a fraction
You can divide the top and bottom numbers of a fraction by the same number 
(an equivalent fraction). This is called reducing a fraction. Reducing a fraction 
usually makes the fraction easier for people to read and use.
If you multiply 3/7 by 7/6, you get a result of 21/42.
But that number’s too clumsy. So then you divide both the numerator and 
the denominator by the same number (in this case, by 21). You get a very 
nice, pretty, and reasonable 1/2.
Fractions as a representation of division
Be sure to remember that, in addition to dividing with fractions, fractions 
themselves can be used to indicate division. For example, when you see a 
fraction like 3/4, you can take it to mean “3 divided by 4.”
 
The concept of fractions as division comes up more in Chapter 9, where we 
discuss decimals and converting fractions to decimals.
Adding fractions
The key to adding fractions is that their denominators (the bottom numbers) 
must be the same. When this is so, adding fractions is usually just like adding 
whole other numbers.
Adding fractions with the same denominator
The following fractions have the same denominator, 9:

127
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
To add the fractions, just add the numerators, as you can see in the following 
equations. Whether they are three fractions, one fraction with 1+5+7 com-
bined, or the sum of 13/9, it’s all the same. You have 13/9.
Converting to a mixed number (14⁄9) is optional:
Adding fractions with different denominators
When denominators are the different, you must make them the same. One 
of the great misquotes from the movies is “We have ways of making you 
talk.” Well, apply it here: “We have ways of making denominators the same” 
(bwa-ha-ha).
To make the denominators the same, find a common denominator, a number 
that both denominators can be converted to.
In this example, you want to add 3/4 and 2/3.
This addition is easy if you convert each fraction to have the same denomina-
tor. You need to find a denominator that you can use to convert 3/4 and 2/3. 
To find the common denominator, just multiply the two bottom numbers, 4 
and 3. The answer is 12, and you can use that as the denominator. (Any other 
number that’s a multiple of both 4 and 3 works, but 12 is the easiest to identify.)
Follow these steps:
 
1. Multiply the top and bottom of the first fraction by the equivalent frac-
tion that results in the common denominator.
 
 In this example you multiply the top and bottom of 3/4 by 3 (which is 
okay because you’re actually multiplying the whole fraction by 3/3, 
which is equal to 1). You get the answer 9/12.
 
 

128
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
2. Repeat Step 1 for the second fraction, using a different equivalent 
fraction that results in the same common denominator.
 
 Multiply the top and bottom of 2/3 by 4, giving 8/12.
 
 
 
3. Using the new fractions formed in Steps 1 and 2, add the numerators.
 
 Add 9 and 8 together, giving 17/12.
 
 
 
4. If you choose, convert to a mixed number when appropriate.
 
 17/12 can be converted to 15⁄12 if you want.
 
Add fractions with the same denominator. If the denominators aren’t the 
same, make them the same.
Subtracting fractions
As with addition (see “Adding fractions” earlier in the chapter), the key to 
subtracting fractions is that their denominators (the bottom numbers) must 
be the same. The following sections show you how.
Subtracting fractions with the same denominator
When the terms in a subtraction problem have the same denominator, as you 
see in the following equation, you use pretty straightforward subtraction in 
the numerator:
Just subtract the numerators 7 – 5 – 1 to get 1. The answer is 1/9.
Subtracting fractions with different denominators
Like adding fractions, when you’re subtracting fractions, you must make the 
denominators the same.

129
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
The following example is similar to the earlier addition example.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Multiply the top and bottom of the first fraction by the equivalent 
fraction that results in the common denominator.
 
 Multiply the top and bottom of 3/4 by 3 (which is okay because you’re 
actually multiplying the fraction by 3/3, which is equal to 1), giving 9/12.
 
 
 
2. Do the same thing to the second fraction, using a different equivalent 
fraction that results in the same common denominator.
 
 Multiply the top and bottom of 2/3 by 4/4, giving 8/12.
 
 
 
3. Using the new fractions formed in Steps 1 and 2, subtract the 
numerators.
 
 Subtract 8/12 from 9/12, giving 1/12.
 
 
 
Subtract fractions with the same denominator. If the denominators aren’t 
the same, make them the same.
Example: Dividing and 
Selling a Cheesecake
 
You have a 3-pound (48-ounce) cheesecake, to be sold as an upscale dessert. 
You want to divide it into 12 slices. What fraction of the whole cheesecake is 
each piece? How many ounces does each piece weigh?

130
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
The first question is easy to answer, if you examine it. This is a simplified 
example of a math concept called inspection. If you cut the cheesecake 
into 12 slices, each slice is 1/12 of the cheesecake.
Here is a representation of the problem as a fraction.
But how many ounces are in each slice? Think in ounces, not pounds. 
There are 48 ounces in 12 slices. If you express this amount as a fraction 
and simplify the numerator and denominator (that is, divide them both 
by 4), you see
When you divide 48 ounces of cheesecake by 12 slices, you get ounces per 
slice, which in this case is 4 ounces.
Pricing your cake wholesale
The cheesecake costs $24 wholesale. Given that one slice is 1/12 of the cake 
(as determined earlier), what is the wholesale cost of each slice?
Just as you can divide slices into weight, you can divide slices into dollars.
The cheesecake has a wholesale price of $2 per slice.
Pricing your cake retail
You want to sell slices of cheesecake for two times (2/1 times) the wholesale 
price (see the preceding section). What should the retail price be?
Express the wholesale price as a fraction and then multiply by a fraction 
representing what you want to sell the slices for, using 1 as the invisible 
denominator.

131
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
When you take a $2 wholesale slice and sell it for two times as much, it’s a $4 
retail slice. You can just as easily retail the cheesecake for three times (3/1 times) 
or four times (4/1 times) the wholesale price, if it’s an amaretto cheesecake with 
a toasted almond crust, finished with whipped cream and a squirt of chocolate 
sauce.
 
This concept is a small part of “budgeted cost percentage” evaluations that 
new chefs learn. The process is more elaborate when costing all ingredients 
and other factors that go into preparation of a dish.
Example: Cutting Fire Stops 
for Framing Carpentry
 
You are framing a room with 2 x 4 studs on 16-inch centers. How long should 
the fire stops be? (A fire stop is a short piece of 2 x 4 nailed between studs. Its 
job is to retard the spread of fire).
This problem uses a great story-problem-solving technique: drawing a 
picture. In Figure 8-7, you can see what studs on 16-inch centers look like. 
Carpentry experience (or a trip to the Internet) tells you that a 2-x-4 stud isn’t 
2 inches wide on the edge; it’s 11⁄2 inches.
So the length of the fire stop must be 16 inches, minus half the thickness of 
one stud and minus half the thickness of the other stud. Half the thickness 
of 11⁄2 inches is 3/4 inch, so write the following equation that describes every-
thing you need to do:
That is, take the 16-inch distance and subtract 3/4 inch. Then take what’s left 
and subtract another 3/4 inch. The answer is 141⁄2 inches.
Bonus example: Suppose you’re using pre-cut 8-foot wall studs (which are 
really only 925⁄8 inches long) to make the fire stops. How many fire stops can 
you cut from one stud?
 
One of the best techniques for addressing story problems is to look for 
common sense possibilities. You can easily see that one fire stop is too few 
stops because it only takes 141⁄2 inches off the stud you’re cutting from. And 
ten fire stops is too many because that’s over 140 inches, and the stud is only 
92 inches and change long.

Try the technique of guessing. You don’t need a precise answer; you just need 
to come close. If there’s any wood left over from this stud, just toss it on the 
waste pile. Follow these steps to use guessing for this example:

133
 Chapter 8: Fun with Fractions
 
1. Multiply the length of one fire stop (141⁄2 inches) by five.
 
 You can start with whatever number you want, but because you know 
the answer here is somewhere between one and ten, five helps you 
eliminate half the numbers as being too high or too low right off the 
bat (assuming the answer isn’t five itself).
 
 
 
 Five stops take 721⁄2 inches, but you still have plenty of stud left over. 
So this answer isn’t big enough.
 
2. Make another guess a bit higher than five.
 
 Maybe seven fire stops will fit.
 
 
 
 Nope! Too many! This amount takes 1011⁄2 inches, which is more length 
than the stud has.
 
3. Try a number between your high and low guesses.
 
 Between five and seven lies six. Okay! Six fire stops take 87 inches, with 
just a little waste. And that’s the best answer you’re going to get.
 
 
 
If you want a fancy term for what you’ve just done, it’s successive approxima-
tion, the technique of applying a series of values in a formula to develop a 
close approximation of a desired value.

Decimals: They Have 
Their Place
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the uses of the decimal point and decimal numbers
▶ Doing math with decimals
▶ Converting fractions to decimals and decimals to fractions
▶ Rounding decimals in your work
▶ Using decimals in change-making and figuring sales tax
D
ecimal numbers (sometimes just called decimals) are so commonplace 
that you probably hardly think about them. Like paved roads and run-
ning water, they show up every day in your work and your personal life. And 
like the roads and the water, you would have a hard time getting through a 
day without them.
You can’t escape decimals in the digital age. If you’re making doors, mold-
ings, or signs or doing granite or stone work, you have to be an artist, a crafts-
person, and a mathematician. The machine shop has used decimal fractions 
for decades. Also, the lab and the hospital use the metric system extensively, 
and all metric numbers are decimal numbers. Metric measurement is also 
increasingly the standard for working with cars and cooking.
Decimals and decimal fractions are easy. In this chapter, you review the 
names for decimal numbers and their parts, do math with decimals, and 
 perform conversions. You also see handy tips about money and sales tax — 
all requiring decimal math.

136
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Diving into Decimal Basics
The decimal number system is a base-10 system, with digits from 0 through 9. 
It’s a positional system, where numbers appear in columns (for example, the 
1s column, the 10s column, and the 100s column).
Zero (0) is a placeholder. You use it where a particular column contains 
nothing.
 
If you’re an ancient Babylonian, you use a sexagesimal (base-60) system. You 
have also been dead for several thousand years, so you’re looking pretty 
good. If you’re of the Nunggubuyu people (in Numbulwar, Northern Territory, 
Australia), you use a base-5 system.
Whole numbers aren’t much to write home about (see Chapter 3). However, 
when you work with decimal numbers smaller than 1, you’re in the world of 
decimal fractions, and life gets interesting and more meaningful.
A decimal fraction is a decimal number whose value is more than 0 but less 
than one. The distinguishing marks of a decimal fraction are the decimal 
point and decimal places, which we cover in the following section. The fol-
lowing are examples of decimal fractions:
0.1 
0.557 
0.9999999999999999
Decimal numbers for modern times
Decimals are modern and precise, and that’s 
what you need in modern times. In the ancient 
past, builders probably built just by judging 
the dimensions of stone and wood. Later, they 
measured, using sticks and knotted ropes. Fast 
forward to modern times. In classical carpentry, 
“vulgar” or common fractions (see Chapter 8) 
were the way to go. You built everything using 
feet, inches, and fractions like
 
 
This scenario was true for both roughing in and 
for finish work, and the best guys (seems like 
they were all men then) could do the math in 
their heads.
But times change. There are no more 15¢ ham-
burgers, tacos, or gallons of gas. In fact, even 
the use of the cents sign (¢) has pretty much 
disappeared. So you can be sure this century’s 
carpenter uses CAD/CAM software for design 
and machine programming, passes the data to 
a CNC router (or another woodworking tool), 
and watches the machine cut quickly and 
accurately. The software and the machines use 
decimal numbers.

137
 Chapter 9: Decimals: They Have Their Place
A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a decimal fraction. 
For example, the following are mixed numbers:
23.1 
100.557 
999,999,999.9999999999999999
The part of the number to the left of the decimal point is the whole number 
part, while the part of the number to the right of the decimal point is the frac-
tional part.
Pointing out decimal points and places
The decimal point is a symbol that shows the boundary between the whole 
number part (integer) and the fractional number part (decimal fraction) of a 
number. You can also call the decimal point the decimal separator, but nobody 
outside of the Mathematics Department ever does. In the United States and 
many countries, the decimal separator is a period (.), but in many other 
countries, it’s a comma (,). For example, in the United States, folks express a 
number as 12,345.67, but Germans use the comma, so the number is 12.345,67.
The following are numbers use the decimal point to show the separation 
between the whole part and the fractional part:
0.789 
1.5 
3.33 
$4.95 
–12.6
The first number, 0.789, doesn’t have a whole number component. When that 
happens, the whole number part is understood to be 0. Use a 0 in front of the 
decimal point.
Decimal places are the digits to the right of the decimal point. They aren’t 
stores that carry decimals on aisle 10. For example, the number 1.5 has one 
decimal place; the number 3.33 has two decimal places. Money ($4.95, for 
example) always has two decimal places, with the very minor exception of 
gasoline pricing and sales tax calculations.
The first number to the right of the decimal point is the first decimal place. 
The second number is the second decimal place, and so forth.
The value of each decimal place decreases as you move right. For example, 
0.01 (two decimal places) is “one hundredth,” or 
while 0.001 (three decimal places) is “one thousandth,” or 

138
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
Many numbers have no decimal places (0 decimal places). They’re whole num-
bers. For example, 23 is a whole number with no decimal places. You can write 
it with a decimal point (as 23.), but it’s not necessary and nobody does it.
 
World War II soldiers were prone to a bit of decimal place humor. An old Army 
jokes says, “An M1 Garand rifle weighs 9.5 pounds. After you carry it a few 
miles, the decimal point falls out.”
Precision, pennies, and parsing
Decimal points have three special uses:
 
✓ Indicating precision in calculations
 
✓ Expressing amounts of money
 
✓ Separating groups of numbers
Precisely, my dear Watson
Decimal places can express precision. Most people use accurate and precise 
as synonyms, but they don’t mean the exactly same thing. The dictionary 
describes accuracy as “the degree of correctness of a quantity.” Precision is 
“the degree to which the correctness of a quantity is expressed.” Translation: 
You can measure something, get it wrong, but get identical results every 
time. Now, that’s precise, even if it isn’t accurate.
 
A machinist can mill a bar with a precision of 0.0001 inch (one ten-thousandth 
of an inch) again and again. That’s precision. However, the whole job may 
be .25 inch off. Oops! That’s an error in accuracy. The mill provides the preci-
sion, but the machinist sets the accuracy. For hunters and target shooters, 
imagine zeroing in a new rifle. If it shoots all the shots in a tight group next to 
each other, but they’re all four inches low and four inches to the left, the rifle 
is precise but not accurate. Best to adjust those sights.
 
Be careful about numbers with trailing zeroes. For example, 2.3 and 2.300 are 
mathematically equal, but the extra zeroes imply that you measured the quan-
tity to three decimal places. If you didn’t, don’t use the extra zeroes.
Life is filled with examples of precision. A laboratory scale easily weighs to 
three decimal places. A digital bathroom scale or a digital postal scale weighs 
to one decimal place.

139
 Chapter 9: Decimals: They Have Their Place
Pennies are the root of all money
U.S. money is based on the dollar. Fractional dollars are based on hun-
dredths. You call a hundredth of a dollar —
— a cent or a penny. In fact, a lot of countries denominate their money in 
units and hundredths of units.
Usually, you express dollars and cents with a decimal and two decimal places 
(for example $1.99) — never with one decimal place. For whole dollars, you use 
zero cents (for example, $1.00). But for whole dollars, you often leave off the 
cents and just write the dollar amount (for example, you write $23.00 as $23). 
You say this figure as “twenty-three dollars” or even “twenty-three bucks.”
For deep and mysterious reasons known only to Big Oil, gasoline pricing is a little 
different. Every gas station in the known universe charges some amount plus 
of a cent per gallon. For example, a price on a filling station sign is something 
like:
The amount, 
of a cent, is equal to 0.009 dollars, not quite a penny. The sign should read 
$4.129. No mathematician would accept a mixed number that contains inte-
gers, a decimal fraction, and a common fraction. However, everybody accepts 
this setup at the gas pump.
Parse the vegetables, please
Here’s an example number that most people have difficulty reading: 
123456789.55. The human mind wasn’t designed to read 11 digits at once, 
even if they use a decimal point as a separator. Therefore, you usually parse 
larger numbers into smaller, more readable groups.
Often you see a number like the 11-digit example written as:
123,456,789.55

140
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
That’s a lot easier to wrap your brain around. A comma (,) separates the units 
into groups of three. This system is what’s used in the United States and many 
countries (including Australia, English Canada, Israel, Japan, and Malaysia).
But in countries that use the comma in place of the decimal point to separate 
whole and fractional numbers (as we discuss earlier in the chapter), the deci-
mal point acts as the comma in parsing numbers. For example, in Germany, 
Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Romania, and much of Europe, you see:
123.456.789,55
You can find variations, too, which include spaces or apostrophes (’) as 
separators.
 
In Microsoft Windows, you can alter the comma and decimal settings for your 
computer. Go to Start → Control Panel → Regional and Language Options. 
These options allow you change the region and use that region’s conventions. 
You can also do some limited format customization for your region.
The Four Ops: Working with Decimals 
in Four Math Operations
In basic math, decimals are practically as easy to work with as integers are. 
You can do the math by hand, in a spreadsheet program, or with a pocket 
calculator or smartphone.
The discussion in this chapter is about The Four Ops (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division — not to be confused with the Four Tops), but other 
operations — percentages, exponents and square roots — are just as easy.
 
If there’s one rule for doing arithmetic with decimals, it’s to line up the decimal 
points — it’s vital for addition and subtraction. It’s not as essential in multipli-
cation and division, but just the same, staying neat and doing your housekeep-
ing makes any math operation easier.
Adding excitement
To manually add decimals, try this method. If, for example, you want to 
add 12.695 and 3.02569, you can try it inline, in the form 12.695 + 3.02569. 
But that’s the hard way. To make it easier, just stack the numbers:

141
 Chapter 9: Decimals: They Have Their Place
This arrangement is clumsy because nothing lines up. How do you know what 
to add to what? To fix the issue, line up the decimal points in the two numbers:
Much better! If you’re concerned that 12.695 doesn’t have any numbers at the 
far right, just fill with zeroes:
Now add. The answer is 15.72069.
This method works for adding two numbers or many numbers. However, be 
careful on a calculator or smartphone. You may not have enough room in the 
calculator for a large number of decimal places.
 
With a spreadsheet, format the cells for several decimal places so that all the 
terms are sure to line up. The answer is the same regardless, but the lined-up 
version looks less confusing. Figure 9-1 shows both approaches on a spread-
sheet, using the earlier example and two more numbers. The numbers in 
column C are much easier to read.

Subtraction gives satisfaction
Subtraction is as easy as addition, and it should be. Subtraction is the oppo-
site (or the inverse) of addition (see the preceding section). And the rules at 
the mathematics fitness center are the same for subtraction as for addition: 
Choose your method and line up the decimal points.
The addition example now becomes a subtraction example. Take 12.695 and 
subtract 3.02569 from it. You can write it inline as 12.695 – 3.02569, but that’s 
no way to solve the problem. Instead, stack the numbers:

142
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Like addition, if you don’t line up the decimal points, you run into trouble. So 
just line up the decimal points to save the hassle:
Fill the top number with zeroes.
Subtract. The answer is 9.66931.
As with addition, note that you may not have enough room in a calculator or 
smartphone for a large number of decimal places.
Subtraction’s easy with a spreadsheet. Like addition, format the cells so the 
decimal points line up. Figure 9-2 shows both approaches on a spreadsheet. 
The numbers in column C are much easier to read.

Multiply with abandon
Multiplying decimals has as many wrinkles as an aging movie star. Fortunately, 
it has fewer side effects than plastic surgery.
You multiply decimals like you do “regular” numbers. Just don’t lose track of 
the number of decimal places — it becomes important later in the process.
For example, if you multiply 3 by .25, the result is .75. The multiplier (number 
you’re multiplying by) has two decimal places and the product also has two 
decimal places. The same is true if you have decimal places in the multipli-
cand (number being multiplied). For example, if you multiply 2.45 (with two 
decimal places) by 3, the result is 7.35, a product with two decimal places.

143
 Chapter 9: Decimals: They Have Their Place
If both parts have decimal places, add up the total number of decimal places 
to determine how many places the product has. For example:
1 × 0.25 = 0.25 
2 decimal places
0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0625 
4 decimal places
0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.015625 
6 decimal places
Here are some tips for multiplying decimals in each method:
 
✓ With a spreadsheet, just enter a formula: =0.25*0.25*0.25
 
✓ With a calculator or smartphone, just keep entering multipliers — 
0.25 × followed by 0.25 × followed by 0.25 — and then press =.
 
✓ For manual work, lining up the zeroes doesn’t get you anywhere. You 
multiply without regard to the decimal point(s) and then fix the number 
of decimal places at the end of the work. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Stack the multipliers without worry about decimal alignment.
 
 For example, to multiply 43.29 by 0.0265, simply write down the 
two numbers:
 
 
 
2. Multiply just as if the multipliers were integers.
 
 In this example, your math looks something like this:
 
 
 
3. Place the decimal point.
 
 Because the multiplicand has two decimal places and the multi-
plier has four decimal places, set the decimal point six places from 
the right. The answer is 1.147185
 
But wait, there’s more! Decimal multiplication gives you a little multiply-by-
ten bonus. The rule is simple: To multiply a number by ten, just shift the 
decimal point one place to the right. To multiply the answer from the exercise 
(1.147185) by 10, shift the decimal:
1.147185 × 10 = 11.47185
To multiply by 100, shift the decimal two places to the right, and so on.

144
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Division is an important decision
Normal division of decimals isn’t normal. It’s the problem child of the Four 
Ops because the results have variations, but you’ll come to love it.
Here are a few things to remember about dividing decimals:
 
✓ As with other operations, your calculator or smartphone may not have 
enough room to hold the answer. If you’re not worried about the digits 
in the more miniscule decimal places, this limitation shouldn’t cause a 
problem.
 
✓ With a spreadsheet, format the cells to allow for a large number of 
decimal places — about eight places is a safe number.
 
✓ With manual calculating, be prepared to shift the decimal point in the 
divisor (number you’re dividing by) and the dividend (number you’re 
dividing into), so the math looks more “normal.” For example, you can 
express 3.00 ÷ .35 as 300 ÷ 35 by shifting the decimal point two places to 
the right in both the divisor and the dividend. The answer is 8.5714.
 
 When you are dividing a larger decimal into a smaller one, you can do 
the same thing. For example, you can express 1.04 ÷ .3.25 as 104 ÷ 325 by 
shifting the decimal point two places to the right in both the divisor and 
the dividend. The answer is 0.32.
You can expect three kinds of results when you divide decimals:
 
✓ When you divide a number by a bigger number, expect a smaller decimal. 
For example:
 
 1.75 ÷ 3 = .583333333
 
✓ When you divide a number by a smaller number, expect a bigger decimal. 
For example:
 
 6.8 ÷ 0.3 = 22.666666
 
✓ When you divide a number by certain other numbers, you may get an 
infinite series of repeating decimals. For example:
 
 1 ÷ 7 = 0.142857142857142857142857142857142857 . . .
 
 In this situation, be prepared to do some rounding (which we cover 
later in this chapter).
 
Like decimal multiplication, decimal division cuts you a break when you’re 
dividing by ten. To divide a number by ten, just shift the decimal point one 
place to the left. Look at this example:
0.58 ÷ 10 = 0.058
To divide by 100, shift the decimal two places to the left, and so on.

145
 Chapter 9: Decimals: They Have Their Place
Decimal Conversion
Common fractions are useful, but you often need to convert them to decimal 
numbers; machines with digital input, especially computers, are often frac-
tion hostile.
 
Machinists and cabinetmakers using computer-aided design aren’t the only 
folks affected by fraction intolerance. Graphic design work uses computers, 
and that means entering decimals. For example, if you’re designing a cover for 
a book with a spine thickness of 
inches, you need to make allowance for that dimension in your design. 
Convert 
inches to 0.9375 inches for your art program to understand what you want.
Decimal numbers are very useful, to be sure, but they have their limits. 
Sometimes you need to convert them to fractions. For example, if you want 
to mail an item that weighs 0.5625 pounds, that’s great, but the post office 
doesn’t do decimal pounds. It does ounces. You need to convert 0.5625 
pound to 
pound, which is 9 ounces. The following sections clue you in on both conver-
sion processes.
Converting fractions to decimals
Turning a fraction into a decimal number is easy. In fact, you probably know 
some conversions by heart. For example, the easiest conversions are
The rule for converting fractions to decimals is to simply divide the denomi-
nator into the numerator to get the answer. In the first example, divide 1 by 4 
to get 0.25. Use a calculator or smartphone, a spreadsheet program, or pencil 
and paper.

146
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
For example, to convert 
to a decimal number, just divide 15 by 16.
15 ÷ 16 = 0.9375
The answer is 0.9375.
 
Your job or school probably celebrates Act Like A Sumerian Day. No? Too bad! 
Well, if you want observe it anyway, you can do your conversions on a clay 
tablet, just like the Sumerians did in the good old (really old) days. In the 4th 
century BC, Sumerian scribes wrote characters on wet clay tablets with a reed 
stylus. No trees were destroyed, and they could recycle the tablets by soaking 
them in water.
 
Early in their careers, machinists learn basic decimal conversions for selecting 
drill bits. Many tables show drill bit diameters as fractions with their decimal 
equivalents, ranging from 
inches to 
inches. However, the world is changing. Fractional bit sizes are still common 
in America, but most of the rest of the world now uses metric sizes.
Converting decimals to fractions
Converting a decimal number to a fraction is just as easy as going from a 
fraction to a decimal (see the preceding section). Maybe easier. Try it for 
yourself and see if you can’t do it in 0.5 of the time. If that sounds stupid, 
that’s because it should be “half the time.” That number 0.5 needs a decimal-
to-fraction conversion.
The conversion rule is simple: Set the decimal up as a fraction and reduce 
it to its simplest terms. For example, to convert 0.75 to a fraction, set up the 
fraction as follows:

147
 Chapter 9: Decimals: They Have Their Place
The basic answer is 
To reduce the fraction, divide both the top and bottom by a common factor. 
Decimal fractions always have 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and so forth as a denom-
inator, so try dividing by factors of 10, such as 5 or 2. You may be able to do 
more division to get to the simplest terms. The most reduced answer is:
 
You can find greatest common factor calculators on the Internet with a quick 
search.
How do you know how big to make the denominator? The number of decimal 
places in the decimal number you have to convert tells you how many zeroes 
to use.
1 decimal place 
= 
 
(one zero)
2 decimal places 
= 
 
(two zeroes)
3 decimal places 
= 
 
(three zeroes)
4 decimal places

(four zeroes)
5 decimal places 
= 
 
(five zeroes)
Round, Round, Get Around, I Get Around
Sometimes, the answer to a decimal calculation isn’t useful because it has 
too many decimal places. In this situation, you need to do some rounding, 
replacing the answer with another value that’s very close to the original. You 
round up and round down, depending on the original answer and the number 
of decimal places you want to round to.
Rounding is a common practice. You do it with money all the time and don’t 
even think about it. For example, if you pay $5.98 for an item and someone 
asks you what it cost, you probably say, “Oh, about six dollars.”
Here are the rules for rounding:
 
1. Figure out how many places you want to round to.
 
 With money, you normally round up or down to whole cents. That’s two 
decimal places.

148
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
2. Look at the numbers to the right of your chosen rounding place.
 
 In the case of money, go to the numbers at the right of the two decimal 
places. For example, in the amount $10.876265, the numbers 6265 are at 
the right of the two decimal places.
 
3. Round up or down depending on the number to the immediate right 
of your chosen rounding place.
 
 If that digit is 5 or greater, round up to the next number. In this example, 
the third digit is 6, so you round up to $10.88.
 
 If the digit you’re rounding from is less than 5, drop the remaining digits 
to round down. For example, if the amount to be rounded is $10.873265, 
the rounded answer is $10.87
You can round to any number of decimal places. For example pi (π) rounded 
to 2 decimal places is 3.14. Pi rounded to 5 decimal places is 3.14159. Just 
look at the number to the right of the place you want to round to.
Making Change and Charging Sales Tax
No matter what your career, the realities of business are that you buy and 
sell. If you buy for cash, you receive change in return. If you sell for cash, 
you’re expected to give change. Either way, knowing how to make change 
accurately is a good idea.
As Ben Franklin noted, nothing is certain but death and taxes. In fact, almost 
all purchases (except some Internet sales) require paying sales tax, and sales 
tax computation is a common use of decimal numbers. The following sections 
show you how to do both of these calculations.
Making change
If you’ve ever gone out to a fast-food lunch, you’ve been on the receiving end 
of making change. Sometimes it’s done well, but sometimes you see the clerk 
struggle; counter help in real life is, sadly, not always as good as the perky 
counter help in TV life.
Making change is the technique of returning to the customer the difference in 
money between the amount of a purchase and the money tendered. Change 
often refers mainly to loose coins but can also include paper money.

149
 Chapter 9: Decimals: They Have Their Place
The modern school of change-making uses a no-math technique:
 
1. The cash register tells the clerk the charges.
 
2. You give the clerk money and he or she enters the “amount tendered.”
 
3. The cash register tells the clerk what change to give you.
But what do you do if you work in a small business without cash registers? 
What do you do at the bake sales held by your church, your service club, or 
your child’s soccer league? You count out change the way your grandmother 
did when she worked at Woolworth’s! Say your customer gives you a ten-
dollar bill for a $9.56 purchase. Leave his bill in plain sight on top of the cash 
drawer and follow these steps to count out his change:
You count his change out and give it back to him, describing what you’re 
giving him. Start with the smallest coins, and don’t give him all pennies. Say, 
“Your purchase was $9.56, out of $10.00. That’s $9.56,
plus 4 cents (4 pennies) makes $9.60,
plus 5 cents (a nickel) makes $9.65,
plus 10 cents (a dime) makes $9.75,
plus 25 cents (a quarter) makes $10.00.”
 
We authors don’t make this stuff up! You may not believe it, but there’s math 
problem called the Frobenius coin problem (named after German mathema-
tician Ferdinand Georg Frobenius) which is about not being able to make 
change. The problem asks, “What’s the largest amount of money that can’t 
be counted out using only coins of specified denominations?” The answer 
depends on the coins in your specific problem. A variation of the Frobenius 
coin problem uses “McNugget numbers.” McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets 
were originally sold in boxes of 6, 9, and 20 nuggets, so the problem asks, 
“What’s the largest number of McNuggets you can’t make up by buying whole 
boxes?” Before McDonald’s introduced the four-nugget Happy Meal, the 
answer was 43 nuggets, but now it’s only 11.
Charging sales tax
Calculating sales tax is simple. This simplicity is a good thing because sales 
taxes themselves aren’t simple anymore. For example, California has no one 

150
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
sales tax. At this writing, the sales tax is 8.875 percent in Nevada City, 8.375 
percent in neighboring Grass Valley, and 9.75 percent in Oakland. To calcu-
late and charge sales tax for a customer, follow these steps.
 
1. Convert the sales tax rate from a percent to a decimal.
 
 Just move the decimal point two places to the left. For example, 8.875 
percent becomes 0.08875
 
2. Multiply the amount of the purchase by the sales tax rate.
 
 This calculation is simply decimal multiplication, which we discuss in 
“Multiply with abandon” earlier in the chapter. For a $1.00 purchase, the 
tax would be
 
 $1.00 × 0.08875 = $0.08875
 
3. Round your answer up.
 
 For more on rounding, check out the earlier section “Round, Round, Get 
Around, I Get Around.” $0.08875 becomes $.09
 
4. Add the result from Step 3 to the purchase amount to get the final 
amount of the purchase.
 
 $1.00 + $.09 = $1.09.
 
The math calculation in the example is correct, but it may not always reflect 
reality. Using a sales tax chart is a good idea. According to the California State 
Board of Equalization’s chart, the tax on a $1.00 purchase in Nevada City is 
$0.08. The tax doesn’t go to $0.09 until the purchase is $1.07.
Example: A Journey to Office 
Supply Heaven
 
You ask yourself why you ever gave up cooking to open your own restaurant. 
Gave up cooking? True statement, because now that you’re the owner of 
Glenda’s Chateau de Swell Eats, you cook less than ever. You may plan the 
menu, but your days are spent running the business. Today is no exception, 
because you’re going to the big box office supply store.
You need to buy a ream of paper, a dozen pens, and a binder. Your local sales 
tax is 8 percent, and you have a 10-percent discount coupon. Table 9-1 shows 
you how much your shopping list items cost, the discount, and the tax rate.

Calculate the cost of your total purchase, applying the discount and the sales 
tax. Here’s a step-by-step approach:
 
1. Add the items to be purchased.
 
 Use decimal addition.
 
 
 
 The total is $32.77.
 
2. Calculate the 10-percent discount.
 
 You first have to convert 10 percent to a decimal (0.1), and then multi-
ply it by your total:
 
 
 
 Adjust the result for the total number of decimal places in the multi-
pliers. That is, the answer should have three decimal places, so your 
answer is $3.277.
 
3. Round the discount to two decimal places.
 
 This task calls for decimal rounding. $3.277 becomes $3.28
 
4. Subtract the discount from the purchase price.
 
 Use decimal subtraction.
 
 

152
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
5. Calculate the sales tax on the discounted amount.
 
 Express the tax of 8 percent as .08. This calculation requires decimal 
multiplication.
 
 
 
 Adjust the result for the total number of decimal places. That is, the 
answer should have four decimal places. The answer is $2.3592.
 
6. Round the discount to two decimal places.
 
 This action calls for decimal rounding. $2.3592 becomes $2.36.
 
7. Add the tax to the purchase to get the total.
 
 $29.49
  $2.36
$31.85
 
 The answer is $31.85.

Playing with Percentages
In This Chapter
▶ Defining a percentage
▶ Checking out four frequently used conversions
▶ Performing basic percentage math
T
he words percent and percentage are everywhere. No matter your occu-
pation, you most likely encounter percentages, both as part of your day-
to-day tasks and as part of the business side, including buying things, selling 
things, and paying people. Percentages are also part of common talk and 
always make appearances in the media, which is just fine when you under-
stand what percentages are and how to use them. But if you don’t, you can 
end up with some big errors and distorted information.
In this chapter, you find out what a percentage is and how to convert num-
bers to percentages. As a bonus, you convert percentages to numbers. And 
you even discover some shortcuts, too.
Pinpointing Percentages: Half a Glass 
Is Still 50 Percent Full
You take half, I’ll take half. Isn’t that the same as saying we’ll split something 
50/50 or saying 50 percent for you and 50 percent for me? That’s three ways 
of saying the same thing.
To put it simply, a percentage is a way of saying how large or small a quantity 
is compared to another quantity. It doesn’t get a bit more complicated than 
that. (You can also call a percentage a percent or a per cent.) For the simplest 
things in life, simple words like “half” work fine. The old saying asks, “Is the 
glass half full or half empty?” The optimist looks at how much is in the glass. 
The pessimist looks at how little is in it. And your common sense tells you it’s 
the same proportion, no matter what.

154
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
But life isn’t usually about the simplest things. If you must prepare a solution 
that contains 1.64 percent of 6 percent sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for peri-
odontal patient home care, simple doesn’t work anymore. Of course, when 
you know the math, percentages get a lot simpler.
Simple or complex, percentages get the job done. You typically use a percent-
age in three ways:
 
✓ To compare a quantity to the whole: A D5W (normal saline) IV is 0.9 
percent sodium chloride — 9 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolved 
in 1 liter of water.
 
✓ To compare one quantity to another: The solution 2/3D & 1/3S (3.3 
percent dextrose / 0.3 percent saline) shows in its name the relative 
amounts of dextrorotatory glucose, sodium ions, and chloride ions in 
the solution.
 
✓ To compare a quantity to an increased or decreased amount of the 
same quantity: For example, a caterer may make allowance for 5 per-
cent extra servings for a big dinner. A discount is a good example of a 
decreased amount (for example, 10 percent off a $1 item means it’s sell-
ing for $0.90.)
One big advantage of a percentage is that it applies to any quantity. For 
example, an intravenous solution of 5 percent dextrose is 5 percent dextrose, 
whether it’s in a 1,000-milliliter bag in a hospital or being manufactured in 
a 10,000-liter tank.
 
Some quantities can’t exceed 100 percent. For example, if your gas tank 
were 110 percent full, you’d be spilling the extra 10 percent on the ground 
(and with today’s gas prices, you may not want to do that). And regardless 
of what your coach or project leader says, you can’t give 110 percent effort. 
She’ll have to settle for 100. But in other situations, you may legitimately 
encounter percentages higher than 100 percent. A class enrollment can be 
200 percent of the previous year’s enrollment. A recipe can be scaled to be 
150 percent of its original quantities.
The following sections give a couple of important concepts to remember 
about percentages.
A percentage is a fraction, but the 
denominator never changes
A percentage is a fraction. What makes it special is that the dominator is 
always 100. (Percent or per cent means “per centum.” That’s from the Latin 
phrase meaning “by the hundred.”)

155
 Chapter 10: Playing with Percentages
So, for example, 17 percent is 
,
a fraction with 100 in the denominator. You use the expression one half —
— but when you convert that to a fraction with a denominator of 100, it 
becomes
,
or 50 percent.
What about larger percentages? You can write 300 percent as: 
That doesn’t look very pretty, but you can reduce it to 3. Yes, 3 is still a 
fraction — 
— but it’s not really eligible to be a percentage until the denominator returns 
to 100.
You can also have fractional percentages. If you have 100 items and then take 
of one of those items, you have  of a 100th (because one whole item out of 
the hundred would be one one-hundreth), or
That’s
percent or 0.5 percent.

156
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
A percentage is a ratio, too
A percent is a fraction. A fraction is a ratio. Therefore, a percent is also a 
ratio. Check out Chapter 8 for more information about ratios.
Here’s a simple example. If you stock 100 cans of motor oil, and 40 of them 
are SAE 5W-20, then 40 out of 100 cans are 5W-20. That’s 
of the cans, or 40 percent of them. You have a 40:60 ratio of 5W-20 to other 
kinds of motor oil in stock.
 
When you have a few friends over for a hot evening of talking math, you can 
refer to a percentage as a dimensionless proportionality. A quantity is dimen-
sionless when it doesn’t have a physical unit. The parts of a percent form a 
proportionality because they have a constant ratio.
Percentages Are Good Converts
When the going gets tough, the tough convert from one form to another. You 
convert percentages into other numbers and other numbers into percentages 
when doing so is convenient. Or when you’re just in the mood.
We cover these conversions in the following sections:
 
✓ Percentage to decimal
 
✓ Decimal to percent
 
✓ Percentage to fraction
 
✓ Fraction to percent
 
If the conversions in the following sections all seem circular, that’s because 
they are. Fractions to decimals to percents and back again. Percents to frac-
tions to decimals and back again. Decimals to fractions to percents and back 
again. They’re all interrelated.
Converting percentages to decimals
You can do some percentage conversions in your head, but when you need 
to get serious, convert then to decimal numbers by using a calculator, a 
spreadsheet, or good old pencil and paper.

157
 Chapter 10: Playing with Percentages
The rule for going from percentages to decimals is simple: Divide the per-
centage by 100. The result is a decimal number because the denominator in 
a percent is always 100 (as we discuss in “A percentage is a fraction, but the 
denominator never changes” earlier in the chapter). So (for example) 67 per-
cent becomes 
or 0.67.
If you need 20 percent of a 1 liter solution, you need 
of it or 0.2 liters. You don’t even have to plug the numbers into a calculator. 
To divide by 100, you can just move the decimal point two places to the left 
of its original position. The number 20 really is 20.0. When you move the deci-
mal to the left, the result is 0.200 liters, or 0.2 liters — the same answer you 
got with the actual division.
 
What do you do when you don’t see a decimal point? Just remember that the 
decimal point is always assumed to follow the ones position in the number. 
And, if the percentage itself has a decimal point, such as 37.6 percent, just 
shift the decimal two places to the left. The answer is .376.
Turning decimals into percentages
Converting from a decimal number to a percentage is just the opposite of 
converting from a percentage to a decimal (see the preceding section). 
When it comes to decimal conversions, you’re faster than any calculator or 
spreadsheet.
To make this conversion, multiply the decimal by 100 and add a percent 
sign. The result is a percentage. For instance, if you want to make 0.67 a per-
centage, multiply 0.67 by 100 to get 67 and then slap a percent sign on it. As 
a shortcut, you can simply shift the decimal point two places to the right, 
which is the same as multiplying by 100.
 
If you machine 0.42689 inches of stock off a 1-inch aluminum bar, what per-
centage do you remove? To find out, just multiply by 100: 0.42689 × 100 = 
42.689 percent. You took off 42.689 percent of it.

158
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Going from percentages to fractions
This conversion has a great taste and it’s less filling. The rule is to drop the 
percent sign and put the number in a fraction over 100. The result is (naturally) 
a fraction. Reduce as necessary. This conversion comes in handy when work-
ing with a fraction is easier than working with a decimal. (Head to the earlier 
section “Converting percentages to decimals” for details on that calculation.)
For, example to convert 26 percent to a fraction, just follow these steps:
 
1. Drop the percent sign and use the numerical portion of the term.
 
 The 26 percent is just 26.
 
2. Set the percentage number as a numerator over a denominator.
 
 The denominator is always 100
 
 
 
3. Simplify your fraction.
 
 
The answer is 
Transforming fractions to percentages
This conversion is the reverse of the conversion of percentages to fractions 
in the preceding section. The rule for converting a fraction to a percentage is 
to convert the fraction into a decimal and multiply by 100. The result is a per-
centage. For example, if you have 
of something, you divide 33 by 100 to get 0.33 and then multiply by 100 to 
arrive at 33 percent.
What if you have 5⁄8 of something? First, divide 5 by 8 to get the decimal 0.625. 
Multiply by 100. The result is 62.5 percent.

 Chapter 10: Playing with Percentages
Calculating Percentage Increases 
and Decreases
The rules for calculating percentage increases and decreases are very simple 
even without the available shortcuts. The following sections present the 
lightning round of increasing and decreasing percentages.
Percentage increases: You 
get 10 percent more!
To increase a number by a percentage, multiply the original number by the 
percentage and then add the result to that original base amount. For example, 
if you normally supply customers with a $50.00 item and must increase its 
price by 15 percent, multiply $50.00 by 15 percent (50 × 0.15) to get $7.50. Add 
the result to the base amount to reach the new price: $50.00 + $7.50 = $57.50.
Of course, the same procedure holds true in calculating the tip in a restaurant.
 
Here’s a tip about tips. To calculate a tip quickly, take the bill and figure 10 
percent in your head. For a $50.00 dinner, that’s $5.00. Then figure 50 per-
cent of that figure (in this case, you get $2.50). Fifty percent of 10 percent is 
another 5 percent, and together they make 15 percent ($7.50). So $7.50 is a 
15 percent tip for a $50.00 dinner. You also may find a tip calculator on your 
cellphone or smartphone.
Percentage decreases: 
You save 10 percent!
To decrease a number by a percentage, multiply that number by the percent-
age and then subtract the result from the base amount. For example, if you 
have a coupon for 20 percent off, and you want to buy a $50 item for your 
business, multiply $50 by 20 percent (0.20) to get $10. That’s the amount of 
your discount. Subtract the result from the base amount ($50 – $10 = $40) to 
get your final price.
 
In the language of office supplies and fashion, “10 percent off” means the mer-
chandise’s regular selling price is discounted by 10 percent.

160
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
An advertising slogan such as “Discounts up to 20 percent or more” is totally 
bogus. The language doesn’t mean anything. If the discounts are “up to 20 per-
cent,” your math lets you calculate any discount from 1 percent to 20 percent. 
But what about “or more?” If the discounts go above 20 percent, why didn’t 
the merchant say so?
The 100 percent increase: You must 
be 100 percent satisfied!
To calculate a 100 percent increase in something, simply double the base 
amount. To calculate a 200 percent increase in something, simply triple the 
base amount.
 
“Wait, what?” you may be saying. “200 percent is twice something, not triple 
it!” That’s correct, but in this case, you’re taking a 200-percent increase — you 
have to account for the original amount as well. Because you’re doubling the 
base and then adding it in again, a 200-percent increase therefore triples the 
amount.
Dividing a Pie Using Percentages
When you have a set of percentages, everything is easy. You divide some-
thing into parts by multiplying by a percentage.
“You divide by multiplying” has kind of a Zen ring to it, doesn’t it? Why does it 
work? A percentage is a fraction, so multiplying a large quantity by a percent-
age has the effect of multiplying it by a fraction (which divides it into portions).
The logic of percentages works with both quantities and amounts. It can 
apply to marbles, pills, cans of motor oil, pounds of rice, and so on.
 
Your food service sells apple pies, and each slice is 12.5 percent of a whole 
pie. How do you divide the pie in the easiest way? Why, you just follow these 
easy pie-dividing steps:
 
1. Turn the number into a fraction.
 
 Follow the conversion rule to turn the percentage (12.5 percent) into 
 
 

161
 Chapter 10: Playing with Percentages
 
2. Reduce the first fraction by dividing both parts by a common factor (if 
possible).
 
 In this example, you can divide the numerator and denominator by 12.5 
to get
 
 
 
 Cut the pie into eight equal slices.
Now here’s an example of dividing by multiplying by two percentages. Your 
food service features two new portions of decadent pie, the Cholesterol 
Colossus (37.5 percent of a whole pie) and the Microscopic Minislice (6.25 
percent of a whole pie). Your boss tells you that you can evenly slice up one 
pie with these portions. How do you divide the pie in the easiest way? Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Turn the numbers into fractions.
 
 Follow the conversion rule to turn the percentages into
 
 
 
2. Reduce the first fraction by dividing both parts by a common factor (if 
possible).
 
 In this example, you can divide the numerator and denominator by 6.25 
to get
 
 
 
3. Repeat Step 2 to reduce the second fraction.
 
 You can divide both parts by 12.5 to get
 
 
 
4. Figure how many giant slices you can get from the pie and how much 
(if any) of the pie is left over.
 
 You can get two big slices (totaling 
 
 
 
 of the pie) but not 3 slices (because that would be 
 
 

162
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
 
 which is more than the whole pie). This amount 
 
 
 
 is the same as 
 
 
 
 of the pie, leaving 
 
 
 
 of it.
 
5. Determine how many of the skinny minislices you can get from the 
rest of the pie.
 
 The remaining 
 
 
 
 pie is equal to 
 
 
 
 pie, so four of your 
 
 
 
 slices finish the pie off nicely.
 
6. Divide the pie by cutting it into the number of slices you determine.
 
 In this example, that’s two 
 
 
 
 pie slices and four 
 
 
 
 pie slices.
About any sous chef or pastry chef knows about half, quarter, and eighth 
slices, so these measurements should be no problem. The ending fractions 
are good in the kitchen, while the starting percentages are good for the cost 
accountants.

Example: The World of Pralines
 
You’ve lived in New Orleans all your life, and you have your grandmother’s 
famous recipe for pralines. You sell about 90 dozen a day in a storefront in the 
French Quarter and online.
You visit your relatives in California. You want to make 3 dozen pralines, but 
you’ve long since forgotten the original recipe ingredient amounts; however, 
you do know your commercial amounts. Use percentages to scale the recipe 
to make the batch you need.
The recipe for 90 dozen (1,080) pralines is
 
✓ 30 cups granulated sugar
 
✓ 30 cups light brown sugar, packed
 
✓ 5.5 quarts half-and-half
 
✓ 7.5 teaspoons salt
 
✓ 2 pounds butter
 
✓ 5 ounces vanilla
 
✓ 7.5 pounds chopped pecans
Beware: Percentages can lie!
In a perfect world, the business information 
you use would be perfect and clear. But it’s not, 
and that’s another indication that it’s not a per-
fect world. Various statistics can be distorted 
(whether accidentally or on purpose).
A New York Times columnist reported legiti-
mate survey results with no hype: “Since 1996, 
the percentage of Americans who said that 
they have been in the presence of a ghost has 
doubled from 9 percent to 18 percent . . . .” A 
hard-working tabloid or cable news channel 
may distort these percentages with the grab-
bing headline “Number of people seeing ghosts 
up 100 percent!” A change from 9 percent to 18 
percent is in fact a 100-percent change, but 9 or 
18 percent is only a small percentage of people 
in a survey sample. It’s dramatic, but not that 
dramatic.
When a sports team ends the season with 1 
win, 1 tie, and 50 losses, the local news report 
may say “Bears won 50 percent of games they 
didn’t lose!” That’s true, because when you 
look only at wins and ties, the Bears had 1 win 
(50 percent) and 1 tie (50 percent). But it sure 
amounts to using percentages to distort the big 
picture (that they lost about 96 percent of their 
total games).

164
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
These amounts are in units you’d use in a home kitchen. A commercial opera-
tion would use pounds of sugar, gallons of half-and-half, and tablespoons 
or ounces to measure salt. Although some of the units here may seem a bit 
unconventional, they make the math easier for the purposes of this example.
 
1. Determine the percentage decrease from the recipe quantity (90 dozen) 
to the desired quantity (3 dozen).
 
 Divide 3 by 90 to get 0.03333.
 
2. Multiply the decimal by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage.
You can move the decimal point two places to the right or do the math 
longhand (or on a calculator) as follows:
0.03333 × 100 = 3.333 percent
 
3. Multiply each ingredient by 3.333 percent (or 0.0333) to develop the 
decreased amounts.
 
 Table 10-1 shows you each ingredients amounts before and after the 
conversion.

 In some cases, you’re just converting decimals to fractions, but some 
ingredients actually change units, so watch out. For safety’s sake, use 
standard conversion units from the Internet or a cookbook. Table 10-2 
shows you the decreased amounts from Table 10-1 converted to more 
familiar-looking amounts.

The recipe is fully converted. You should get your batch of 3 dozen pralines 
with no problem.
 
Pralines get their name from Cesar du Plessis-Praslin (1598–1675), a duke and 
a Marshall of France. He offered almonds coated in cooked sugar to famous 
women, with “love” in mind. (“Want some candy, little girl?”) When the French 
settled in Louisiana, they substituted pecans for almonds. And of course, 
Praslin didn’t invent the praline. It was created by his chef, Clément Lassagne. 
(No, they didn’t name lasagna after him.)
Example: Oily to Bed and Oily to Rise
 
Your shop has 240 cans of motor oil. 120 are SAE 5W-30. 96 are SAE 10W-30, 
and 24 are SAE 60. What percentage of your total supply of cans does each oil 
type make up?
 
1. Organize your info.
 
 Making a table like this one is a great way to do just that.

2. Calculate the percentage of your supply each grade comprises.
 
 Divide each grade’s quantity by the total supply to determine how much 
of the total quantity that type represents. For example, to calculate the 
percentage for 10W-30, divide those 96 cans by 240:
 
 
 
3. When you complete the three conversions, put them in a table to 
check your work.
 
 Use a table like the one that follows; when the table is complete, add up 
the percentages. They should total 100.

Square Roots
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering exponents and bases
▶ Performing basic exponent math — addition and subtraction
▶ Considering three ways of calculating a square root
M
athematics has two mysteries that don’t deserve that status: expo-
nents and square roots. Knowing the concepts is important because 
then the mystery disappears. Life is challenging enough without having a 
long list of mystery items.
Exponentiation is a mathematics word that means “applying an exponent to a 
base” or “raising a number to a power.” Using a few small numbers as expo-
nents to generate large and useful numbers may seem mysterious, but it’s not 
so hard. The square root of a number is another number that when multiplied 
by itself yields the original number. The mystery here is that there doesn’t 
seem to be any obvious way to intuitively find square roots.
It’s not as though you never use exponents or square roots in your work. 
Exponents and square roots are often just disguised or used limitedly. 
Practical use of exponents is the world of square and cubic measure, labora-
tory work (using metric units), and information technology. The practical 
world of square roots is very narrow and includes finding the radius of a 
circle or the edge length of square areas.
In this chapter, you see the way exponents work and review their most useful 
applications. You also discover the simple shortcuts in exponent math. The 
bonus part is that you see three ways to calculate a square root.

Exponentiation: The Power of Powers
Exponentiation is a mathematics process represented in expressions and 
equations by just a couple of symbols. After you’ve met up with the word 
exponentiation (and this chapter is your opportunity), you aren’t likely to 
use it in everyday speech.
The basics of the base
An expression in exponentiation has two parts, a base and a power. The 
power is often called the exponent:
basepower or baseexponent
The base is a number you raise to a power. The power is a number you raise 
the base by (and it’s indicated by a raised number — a superscript). Here’s an 
example with specific numbers:
34
In the example, 3 is the base and 4 is the exponent. You say this number as 
“three raised to the fourth power” or “three to the fourth.”
Some exponents have special names. You have seen numbers like these:
72 or 1,549 ft2
When you raise a number to the second power (power of 2), you often call 
it square measure. Refer to the first example (72) as “seven squared.” Say 
the second example (1,549 ft2) as “1,549 square feet.” “Square feet” is the 
common way of expressing the size of spaces or areas such as offices, park-
ing lots, driveways, and carpeting.
When you raise a number to the third power (the power of 3) you often call it 
cubic measure.
43
You call 43 “four cubed.” A cubic foot (CF) of volume is the volume of a con-
tainer 1 foot in length, 1 foot in width, and 1 foot in height.
1 ft × 1 ft × 1 ft = 1 ft3

169
 Chapter 11: Tackling Exponents and Square Roots
“Cubic feet” is a common measure of commercial and consumer refrigerator 
capacity. When welders talk about 40 CF, 60 CF, and 80 CF tanks, they aren’t 
referring to the size of the tank but rather to the amount of compressed weld-
ing gas the tank holds.
In the world of science, you may see metric volume measurements such as 
cubic centimeters (cm3); however, in the lab or hospital, a cubic centimeter 
may be abbreviated as cc or referred as a milliliter (ml).
Moving beyond 2 or 3
Powers don’t stop with just the second and third power. The most ambitious 
powers want to be bigger than 2 or 3 because higher powers (in addition to 
being generally revered) are a very compact way of expressing very large and 
very small numbers, which we discuss further in the “Powers with base 10” 
and “Powers with base 2” sections later in this chapter.
Table 11-1 shows you an example of a simple expression representing a large 
number:

In Table 11-1, the base (2) doesn’t change, but the exponent does. Notice how 
quickly a small three-character expression (228) represents a very large number. 
Such large numbers are easier to manipulate when you express them in such a 
compact form. The same is true with SI units (the International System of Units, 
which you commonly call the metric system). A little bit of writing gets you a 
whole lot of number. The range of metric terms (for liters, for example) goes 
from the very tiny yoctoliter (10–24, or 1/1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) to the 
very large yottaliter (1024, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000).

170

Different faces of special bases
When you work with exponentiation, you can use almost any base and almost 
any power. In algebra, you see terms whose values aren’t known — for exam-
ple, ab — and they can represent anything until you know the solution.
However, you need to know about a few special bases and powers. A couple 
of them drive the world these days, and others are just oddities (unless 
you’re a theoretical physicist). Here are tonight’s contestants on Dancing 
with the Power and Base Stars; we discuss them in the following sections:
 
✓ Powers with base 10: Much like basketball and ice hockey power for-
wards, base 10 is the star of the show.
 
✓ Powers with base 2: This base has been rising fast since the dawn of the 
computer age.
 
✓ Powers with base 1: This dull base only has one trick.
 
✓ Powers with base 0: This base is also dull, but with a hint of controversy.
 
✓ Powers with base –1: A base with only two results.
 
✓ Powers of 1 and 0: These two don’t deal with bases but with rather 
unusual properties of certain powers.
Powers with base 10
You grow up counting to 10. Later, you count to 100, and one day on a 
dull afternoon, you count to 1,000. These three numbers are all multiples 
of (and therefore powers of) 10. When you express them with powers, 10 
becomes 101, 100 becomes 102, and 1,000 becomes 103.
In middle school and high school, you go a step further. Put a 1 in front of 
a 10 raised to a power and you have scientific notation. The numbers 10, 100, 
and 1,000 become 1 × 101, 1 × 102, and 1 × 103.
 
Powers of 10 are prominent in the lab and in the observatory, whether you 
measure the number of molecules in a reagent, the diameter of an atom’s 
nucleus or the distance to a star. For example, NASA says the distance to 
Proxima Centauri is about 39,900,000,000,000 kilometers. It’s a lot easier to 
write this distance as 39.9 × 1012 kilometers.
Using powers of 10 is a much easier way to do math on very large or very 
small numbers. In exponentiation, the equivalent of a decimal shift is increas-
ing or decreasing the power. A one-decimal shift to the right gets you a tenfold 

171
 Chapter 11: Tackling Exponents and Square Roots
increase in the value of a number. That is, to multiply a number with a base 
of 10 by 10, just increase its exponent by 1. A one-decimal shift to the left 
 produces a tenfold decrease in the value of a number. To divide a number 
with a base of 10 by 10, decrease its exponent by 1. These shifts mean you’re 
changing the order of magnitude.
Look at this example:
10 × 1,000 = 10,000 or 10 × 103 = 104
That’s increasing the number by a factor of 10.
You can also use negative powers of 10 — they represent division. A milliliter 
is 
 of a liter, and you express that as 10–3 liters.
Powers with base 2
Powers with base 2 are at the very core of computing. From the earliest elec-
tronic computers to the latest ones you need for your work, the internal math 
is base 2 math.
 
Counting to ten was a pretty easy task for our ancestors, and civilizations 
have risen and fallen while they used decimal math. Trouble is, counting to 
ten is very complicated for a computer. Counting to 2, however, isn’t bad. A 
microprocessor can multiply by 2 or divide by 2 just by doing a bit shift. Very 
efficient. If you’re a microprocessor, you know two states (1 for “on” and 0 for 
“off”), and that’s all you need.
You as a professional use the powers of base 2 in two ways:
 
✓ If you work with computers professionally (in information technology 
or as a computer tech), various base 2 numbers are your daily compan-
ions. Those numbers include
 
• Processor speed in Hz
 
• RAM in gigabytes
 
• Disk capacity in megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes
 
• Network speed in megabits and gigabits
 
• Video board memory in megabytes
 
✓ If you buy or use computers as part of your work, you’ll see base 2 num-
bers (or their abbreviations) all the time.

172
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
Table 11-2 lists some common abbreviations and their numeric representa-
tions in base 2 and base 10 (covered in the preceding section):

Note that the name megabyte actually means 1 million bytes. However, the 
real number of bytes in a megabyte is 1,048,576, and everybody goes along 
with the convention.
 
Did you know that the world may be running out of Internet addresses? The 
current IPv4 system has only 4,294,967,296 (232) addresses available. The pro-
posed IPv6 system would have 2128 addresses. That’s a big number.
Powers with base 1

ous powers? Use this handy table to see the answer:

Powers with base 0
Powers with base 0 have produced a controversy, and you won’t encounter 
them in your work. However, you need to know about them, so here are the 
rules, straight from multiple online sources.
 
✓ If the exponent is positive, the power of zero is zero:
 
 0n = 0, no matter how large the exponent.

173
 Chapter 11: Tackling Exponents and Square Roots
 
✓ If the exponent is negative, the power of zero (0n, where n < 0) is called 
“undefined,” because division by zero is implied and that’s impossible.
 
 0–n = undefined.
 
✓ If the exponent is zero, some mathematicians define it as one and others 
leave it undefined.
 
 00 = 1 or may be undefined. Either choice is a safe bet for you.
Powers with base (–1)
A base of (–1) isn’t much to shout about, but it’s twice as exciting as powers 
with a base of 1 — it has two rules.
 
✓ When the exponent n even, −1n = 1
 
✓ When the exponent n is odd, −1n = −1
Powers of 1 and 0
Exponentiation has a couple of special conditions dealing with the powers 
(not the bases) of 1 and 0. This section introduces you to them, but the fol-
lowing section shows you them in action.
The math of exponentiation shows that any number raised to the power of 1 
is itself, as the following examples show:
11 = 1
101 = 10
7561 = 756
2,568,145,2591 = 2,568,145,259
Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, as indicated in the following examples:
10 = 1
100 = 1
7560 = 1
2,568,145,2590 = 1
Exponentiation math
Exponentiation math is fast, fair, and friendly. To multiply two numbers with 
the same base, you add the powers. To divide the numbers, subtract the 
powers. A term with an exponent represents repeated multiplication.

174
Part II: Making Non-Basic Math Simple and Easy 
When you multiply two terms with exponents, you see that the result is iden-
tical to adding the exponents.
For example, 52 is 5 × 5 and 53 is 5 × 5 × 5.
That is, 52 is 25 and 53 is 125. If you multiply 52 by 53, you’re multiplying 25 by 
125. The answer is 3,125.
What if you add the exponents 2 and 3? The result is 55 or 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. 
And the result of doing the multiplication is 3,125. The answer is the same: 
3,125.
The same idea is true when you divide; you just subtract the powers.
Use the figures from the multiplication example and divide 53 by 52.
What if you just subtract the exponents? You get the same result.
 
Now if the result turns out to be 50, the answer is 1, because any base raised to 
the power of 0 is 1.
If the result turns out to be a negative exponent (such as 5–1), it’s a reciprocal. 
The general rule is
Using 5 as an example:
The answer is

175
 Chapter 11: Tackling Exponents and Square Roots
And to see this process in a longer form, divide 52 by 53.
Again, the answer is
Getting Back to Your(Square)Roots
You know how to square numbers. The subject may have come up in elemen-
tary school very soon after you learned multiplication, and then again in high 
school math and maybe in community college math. And multiplying to get 
a square value comes up in several chapters in this book, including this very 
one. The earlier section “The basics of the base” shows you that a square is 
another way of describing a number raised to the power of 2. For example 
5 squared is also 52 and equals 25.
But what if you have the square and need to find out what it’s the square of? 
The inverse of squaring a number is finding a number’s square root. A square 
root is all about finding the value of the base when you know only the result 
of squaring the value. A square root operation has a symbol. The following 
symbol shows a problem where you’re looking for the square root of 16:
So what’s the square root of 16? It’s 4. When you were younger, you prob-
ably studied the easy ones: 4 (answer, 2), 9 (answer, 3), 16 (answer, 4) and 25 
(answer, 5). That’s great, but what happens when you need to find the square 
root of 625? You need a math solution, not memory. Luckily, the following 
sections give you three methods for finding square roots: the hard way, the 
easy way, and the effortless way.
Note: Truth in advertising: You may not find a lot of opportunities to use 
square root math in your trade. For example, if a cement mason knows the 
area of a circular patio, he or she can use a square root formula to find the 
patio’s radius and diameter. But that’s a bit backward because the mason 
usually starts with the linear dimensions (such as the radius) and then comes 
up with the area to calculate the volume of the concrete pour.

Why are they called roots, anyway? Maybe because, like a plant’s roots, 
they’re basic and lie below the surface. Two sources say that in math, the root 
of a number x is any number that, when repeatedly multiplied by itself, even-
tually yields x. A square root is a root where the number is multiplied by itself 
once. A cube root is where the number is multiplied by itself twice. Higher-
order roots are possible, too.
Square roots the hard way
A manual method for finding square roots does exist, but it’s not for the faint-
hearted. High schools taught it in the 1960s, and even then only in the accel-
erated math classes. It’s cumbersome and slow, although it’s accurate. You 
can find the method on the Internet, but the chances are good that you won’t 
find it to be a good use of your time.
Square roots the easy way
Use the technique of successive approximation (also called guessing) with the 
help of a calculator. This method is the thinking person’s guessing.
For example, if you want to find the square root of 19 to three decimal places, 
take the following approach:
 
1. Examine the situation.
 
 You know that the square root of 25 is 5. The result 25 is too high, so the 
root 5 is too high. You know that the square root of 16 is 4. That result 
(16) is too low. The answer you want is somewhere between 4 and 5.
 
2. Split the difference between your too-high and too-low numbers.
 
 Try punching 4.5 into your calculator and squaring it. The answer 
is 20.25. That’s a little high.
 
3. If your result isn’t quite right, try again, splitting the difference 
between your most recent guess and a lower number (if your guess 
was too high) or a higher number (if your guess was too low).
 
 Split the difference between 4 and 4.5. Enter 4.25 on your calculator and 
square it. The answer is 18.0625, so you’re getting closer.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until you get the most accurate answer you can.
 
 Split the difference between 4.25 and 4.5. With 4.375, you get 19.140625, 
which is still just a little high. Try 4.3, 4.335, 4.355, 4.357, and 4.358. The 
last answer is 18.992. Close enough, though you can keep approximating 
if you like.

177
 Chapter 11: Tackling Exponents and Square Roots
Square roots the effortless way
The effortless way to calculate a square root doesn’t help your math skills, 
but it does get the job done. Pick one of two methods:
 
✓ Use your pocket calculator, scientific calculator, or smartphone. It may 
have a square root key:
 
✓ Use Microsoft Excel or Open Office Calc. The Excel square root function 
is =SQRT(nnn), where nnn is the number whose square root you want 
to find.
Example: Finding the Bytes On a Disk
 
You’re installing disks with an advertised capacity of 320 gigabytes (GB). Your 
curiosity gets the better of you and you ask, “How many bytes is that?” You 
can solve this problem in two ways, and both are simple:
 
✓ Method 1: Take the known decimal number for 1 GB and multiply it by 
the number of bytes advertised. Table 11-2 earlier in this chapter tells 
you that known number is 1,073,741,824 bytes/gigabyte. One gigabyte is 
also 230 bytes.
The answer is 343,597,383,680 bytes (although don’t get too excited — 
the disk will have less capacity after it’s formatted).
 
✓ Method 2: Take the known base 2 number for a gigabyte (also listed in 
Table 11-2) and multiply it by the number of gigabytes.
 
 This answer is technically correct, but it probably doesn’t satisfy your 
urge to see the answer in big base 10 digits. If you expand the factor of 
230 to become 1,073,741,824 bytes, you’re repeating method 1.

In this part . . .
P
art III contains the “miracle math” chapters. Well, 
okay, the chapter about areas, perimeters, and vol-
umes is only semimiraculous. But it’s very handy and may 
be magical to some folks. 
The big magic is in the power you get from the other 
chapters, those devoted to algebra (12), formulas (13), 
geometry (14), areas and volumes (15), and trigonom-
etry (16). Those five concepts are powerful, and they usu-
ally inspire fear and awe when you first encounter them. 
But consider this: Cave dwellers first feared fire because it 
could burn them. But when they mastered it, fire kept 
them warm and cooked their food. The modern equivalent 
is that when you master these subjects, your technical job 
will pay your heating bill and buy your groceries.

▶ Boning up on algebra terms and operations
▶ Meeting x, the famous variable
▶ Testing out algebra in some real-world situations 
A
lgebra is a branch of mathematics loved by a few and feared by many. 
Algebra is almost always in secondary education (high school) cur-
riculums, but that doesn’t mean everybody takes it. Some avoid it, and others 
who take it may come away scarred for life. Well, cut that out! You don’t have 
to suffer from algebra-phobia. It’s a simple part of math that gives you great 
control over your work.
The biggest concept is easy to grasp: in algebra, variables (which we cover in 
detail later in this chapter) are letters that represent numbers. That’s it. And 
they only represent numbers until you solve a problem and replace the vari-
ables with numbers. As this chapter shows, you work on algebraic variables 
with the same math operations you use on numbers.
And why, you may well ask, should you care about these concepts? Because 
they’re valuable in your everyday work. You may not even know when you’re 
using algebra, but you can be sure pharmacy assistants, concrete contrac-
tors, computer techs, welders, cosmetologists, and roofers (to name just a 
few) calculate using algebra.
In this chapter, you get friendly with the names of the parts of an algebra 
statement. Then you go on to do simple (but essential) math operations.

182
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Variables: Letters Represent Numbers, 
but the Math Is the Same
In arithmetic, you come across problems with numbers in them. In algebra, 
you come across problems with letters in them. For example:
a + 2 = b
The letter a represents an unknown number, but when you know a and add 2 
to it, you can figure out what b is.
Before you start applying math to the variables, you need to know how to 
refer to the letters, numbers, and the expressions they create. The following 
sections get you up to speed on this vocab.
Understanding variables
A variable is a symbol that represents a value that can vary (hence the name 
variable). It stands for a number you don’t know. The following are a few 
examples of variables:
a b c d x z
Variables can be any letter you want. Remember, a variable doesn’t have a 
fixed or final value, at least not until you solve the problem. When you hear 
teachers, students, and co-workers talk about “solving for x,” they’re working 
with a variable (x) of unknown value. We cover variables in a great deal of 
detail later in this chapter.
Corralling constants
The opposite of a variable is a constant, which has a fixed value. The numbers 
3, 2.5, 1⁄2, and π are constants, although constants can be numbers of any kind.
Sometimes a constant used in multiplication is called a coefficient or an index. 
Essentially, the words mean the same thing — a fixed multiplier. A constant can 
also be a fixed value in an expression or equation (see the next two sections).
 
There are many constants, and all of them are used in higher math, which is 
beyond the scope of this book. What we have here is something of a “short 
shot,” or an attempt to provide a simple definition and a sample.

183
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
Examining expressions
An expression is a combination of symbols. That’s it! An expression isn’t 
necessarily equal to anything; it’s like using a phrase rather than a whole 
 sentence. Here’s a sample expression:
3 + 4 + 5
This expression is made up entirely of constants. You can easily find an 
answer to what 3 + 4 + 5 is, but that’s not the goal here. What’s important is 
how the symbols look when they’re written out together.
But expressions don’t have to consist only of constants. An algebraic expres-
sion also includes variables:
a + b + c
Here, you add some unknown quantity of something (a) to an unknown quantity 
of something else (b) and then add that total to another unknown quantity (c).
For your purposes, the three symbols may represent sheetrock in three piles, 
pills in three containers, three time periods for cooking, or the quantities of 
three chemicals you need for coloring hair.
Getting a handle on equations
An equation is a combination of symbols, like an expression. The difference is 
that it has an equal sign (=) to show that two expressions are, well, equal. For 
example, here’s one expression:
3 + 4 + 7
And here’s another:
5 + 8 + 1
These numbers aren’t much to write home about, but when you relate the 
expressions in an equation, the game heats up. For example, is the following 
true?
3 + 4 + 7 = 5 + 8 + 1
A little arithmetic on both sides of the equation gives you this:
14 = 14

184
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
What a relief! Now in the world of algebra, equations are far more interesting. 
For example:
a + b = 14
You don’t know what a and b are yet, but the equation declares that they 
equal 14.
Taking time for terms
A term is any one part of an expression or equation (see the preceding two 
sections), separated from other terms by an addition (+) or subtraction (–) 
sign. 
So, where did algebra come from, anyway?
Here’s something you may not know: the word 
algebra comes from the Arabic word al-jabr, 
and it means “restoration.” But even though 
it’s a word with Arabic roots, algebra goes 
back much farther to the Babylonians, a cul-
ture that sources say existed by 1728 BC, when 
Hammurabi, the great lawgiver, was king.
The Egyptians, Greeks, Indians, and Chinese 
made other math contributions, but algebra’s 
ancient roots are in Babylonia.
It’s the same Babylonia well known for archeo-
logical findings, the Bible, the story of the Tower 
of Babel, and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. 
Babylon is thought to have been, at one time, 
the largest city in the world, so it’s no surprise 
that these folks were brilliant masters of practi-
cal matters, such as
 ✓ All the construction and technical trades
 ✓ Technology, like metal working
 ✓ Astronomy and medicine
 ✓ Art and architecture
None of these pursuits would be possible with-
out higher math — algebra.
The Babylonians were no slackers. They devel-
oped solutions to complex problems that today 
require elements of algebra that we don’t cover 
in this book: linear equations, quadratic equa-
tions, and indeterminate linear equations.
The Babylonian system of math was sexagesi-
mal, or a base 60 numeral system. Don’t worry 
about what exactly that means; just know 
that it’s the foundation of the modern systems 
of 60-second minutes, 60-minute hours, 360-
degree circles, and so on. 
One more thing: You may have heard of 
Omar Khayyám, the famous poet born in the 
Great Seljuq Empire (now part of Iran) in 1048 
AD and partly known for the line “a Jug of 
Wine, a Loaf of bread — and Thou.” But Omar 
Khayyám was  famous during his times as a 
mathematician — he wrote the Treatise on 
Demonstration of Problems of Algebra in 1070.

185
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
A term can be a constant, a variable, or the product of constants and vari-
ables. For example:
x + y + 3a – ab – xy + 3abxy
The terms are x, y, 3a, ab, xy and 3abxy. The term 3a is a combination of 3 
and a, and it means “three times the amount of a.”
The term xy is a combination of x and y, and it means that x and y are multi-
plied together. Notice that you don’t need a regular multiplication sign (×), 
middle dot (·), or asterisk (*) to show multiplication.
Variable Relationships: 
X and Her Friends
Although variables can be any letter, x is the most popular and enduring 
option for reasons beyond understanding. (Check out the nearby sidebar for 
a few theories.) The variable x has become the Queen of the Unknowns.
Other letters near the end of the alphabet, like y and z, are also popular vari-
ables. In some applications, the variables represent key words in the applica-
tion. Here’s an example from geometry (a topic we discuss in Chapter 14):
area of a rectangle = lw
In this example, the variable l stands for the length of the rectangle and the 
variable w stands for its width:
When you’re comfortable with variables, you’re ready to look at how they 
hook up with constants and group together with like variables, as the follow-
ing sections discuss.
Best friends forever: The constant 
and the variable
Although variables and constants may seem opposed by definition, they’re 
actually quite good algebraic buddies. In the real business of algebra, a con-
stant and a variable are inevitably paired. They’re best friends forever.

186
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
A constant and a variable together look like these examples:
Look at the 3b example. It represents the constant 3 multiplied by the vari-
able b. This arrangement is just like multiplying in arithmetic, but with two 
exceptions.
 
✓ b is a letter.
 
✓ You don’t need any sort of sign or symbol to show multiplication. It’s 
understood.
 
You can represent 3b in any of the following ways:
3 × b     3 · b     3 * b     b + b + b
The first three use multiplication symbols; the fourth expression adds b three 
times. But save yourself the effort — the expression 3b says it all.
Tracking down the Queen of the Unknowns, 
and other variable fun
The origin of x as the go-to variable is, well, 
unknown. Speculation abounds, but nobody 
knows for sure. Here are a few possible answers:
 ✓ In the days of quill pens, x (and y, too) was 
the easiest to write.
 ✓ Dr. Ali Khounsary, Advanced Photon 
Source, Argonne National Laboratory, sug-
gests that algebra solves for the unknown 
“thing” and that the word for thing or object 
in Arabic is shei, which was translated into 
Greek as xei and possibly shortened to x.
 ✓ Dr. Khounsary also points out, “It is also 
noteworthy that xenos is the Greek word for 
unknown, stranger, guest, or foreigner, and 
that might explain the reasons Europeans 
used the letter x to denote the ‘unknown’ in 
algebraic equations.”
The use of x as a variable representing the 
unknown is not only widespread in math but has 
also permeated Western culture. For example:
 ✓ In 1985, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered a 
new type of radiation, which he tempo-
rarily called “X-rays” because they were 
unknown. Even though X-rays are called 
Röntgen radiation in some languages, in 
many other languages they’re still known 
as X-rays.
 ✓ Science fiction novels, comics, movies, and 
television shows such as The X-Files use x 
to represent mystery and the unknown.
 ✓ Any pirate movie with a decent map shows 
a big X where the treasure is because “X 
marks the spot.” (Well, okay, that may be 
more of a marking symbol than an unknown 
symbol.)

187
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
 
You may think that the a in the earlier example has no constant, but any solo 
variable has an imaginary 1 as a constant. Any number times 1 equals itself, 
and the same applies to variables multiplied by 1.
As we mention earlier in the chapter, you may come across the terms coeffi-
cient (such as the Coefficient of Friction or COF in automotive technology) or 
index (such as the refractive index, or how much light bends when it passes 
from air into a lens, if you work with optics) rather than constant. They all 
mean the same thing.
Simplifying variables: Variables 
of a feather flock together
In math, you can change the order of terms without changing the result. This 
property is called commutativity, and it’s an important part of doing math 
operations with variables. For example, these two expressions are the same. 
The terms are just in a different order:
x + y = y + x
The expression a + b + 3a has terms with both a and b. You can write the 
expression in a different order — a + 3a + b. This move doesn’t change the 
result, but now you can more easily combine the a terms to get 4a. You get 
the expression 4a + b. We get formal about commutativity (and other funda-
mental math properties) in Chapter 13, but for now it’s casual Friday.
Math Operations with Variables
Whether you’re mixing liquids for hair color, assisting a pharmacist with 
compounding, or calculating the weight and coverage of mission tiles for a 
roof, you do math operations with variables. The following sections give you 
the skinny on performing the four main math operations (addition, subtrac-
tion, multiplication, and division) in equations with variables.
In algebra, as in arithmetic, an equation has two sides. These sides are called 
(get ready) the left side and the right side. For example:
a + b = c + d
In the example, the left side contains a+b and the right side contains c+d.

188
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
If an equation is true, you can do identical math operations to both sides of it 
without it becoming untrue.
In both math practice and in real life, algebra equations are true (assuming 
you set them up correctly) because you create them to determine unknown 
values (say, how many fan belts are in the stockroom) based on values you 
already know (for example, three fan belts on the top shelf and two identical 
belts on another shelf). Here’s your fan belt equation:
x = 3 + 2
How about an untrue equation? For a false equation, try
17 = 3 + 2
That’s just plain bad arithmetic. Here’s a more creative false algebraic 
 equation:
b = 2b + 3b
How can three of something (3b) and two of something (2b) add up to be one 
of something (b)? Unless b just happens to be zero, this equation is math-
ematical nonsense.
When an algebra equation is true, you can add, subtract, multiply, or divide 
both sides of an equation (although you can’t divide by zero).
But wait! There’s more! (We sound like a late-night infomercial.) Just like 
numbers, you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide variables. These opera-
tions are how you reduce equations to their simplest terms; the following 
 sections give you more information on each operation.
 
The better you can do math operations on variables, the faster and easier 
your work becomes. All the techniques in this section apply in real-life sce-
narios, mostly in a simpler form than they appear here. Real-life situations are 
what show up in story problems, which we show later in the chapter.
Adding variables
The most important rule in adding variables is that you may only add like 
terms. Say you’re baking apple pies and the recipe calls for six pounds of 
apples. You have only four pounds on hand, but you remember that you also 
have two pounds of oranges. Don’t do it! Apples and oranges don’t mix in 
apple pies, and neither do different variables in algebraic expressions.

189
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
To keep from ruining your algebra pie, follow these rules: 
 
✓ You can add terms with the same variable.
 
✓ You can’t add terms with different variables.
 
✓ The order of the terms doesn’t matter, and you can rearrange the order.
The following expression has six terms, separated by addition signs. It 
has three different variables (a, b, and c). You need to treat each variable 
separately.
3a + 2b + 4c + 2a + b + 4c
To add terms in an expression, first identify the like variables:
 
✓ The first variable is a:
 
 3a + 2b + 4c + 2a + b + 4c
 
✓ The second variable is b:
 
 3a + 2b + 4c + 2a + b + 4c
 
✓ The third variable is c:
 
 3a + 2b + 4c + 2a + b + 4c
Now that you know the like variables, your next operation is to combine them:
 
1. Starting with the variable a, use the commutativity property of addi-
tion to rewrite the expression.
 
 3a + 2b + 4c + 2a + b + 4c
 
 Check out “Variables of a feather flock together” earlier in the chapter 
for more on this property. Now the a terms are together:
 
 3a + 2a + 2b + 4c + b + 4c
 
2. Add the coefficients of each of the “a” terms.
 
 You end up with 5a:
 
 3a + 2a = 5a
 
3. Rewrite expression with simplified variable a.
 
 After you insert the newly condensed 5a into the expression, the expres-
sion looks like this:
 
 5a + 2b + 4c + b + 4c

190
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for the variables b and c.
 
 You must continue to combine the like terms for all remaining variables 
until all are in their simplest forms. The single variable b has an invisible 
constant of 1.
 
5. Rewrite the expression, with all the reduced terms, in its simplest form.
 
 Your final expression looks like this:
 
 5a + 3b + 8c
Subtracting variables
Get ready to tackle that pesky subtraction sign. You don’t have to worry 
about any new rules or properties being thrown unexpectedly your way. 
The only thing that may give you a little problem is remembering to place the 
operation signs in the proper order.
 
Approach the subtraction signs with caution, to ensure you get the expression 
simplified correctly.
The following example shows you how to move the operation signs correctly. 
Start with an expression such as the following:
3a + 2 – 2a – 1
Rewrite the expression to combine the variables and constants. Pay particu-
larly close attention to the subtraction sign preceding the variables (that’s 
–2a in the example) you’re working with. You need to make sure that it stays 
“attached” to the correct variable. Your rearranged expression looks like this:
3a – 2a + 2 – 1
Now, you’re ready to combine the like a and number terms (separately, of 
course):
3a – 2a = 1a 
2 – 1 = 1
Together, the result is
a + 1
The expression is now in its simplest form, and you can go no farther.

191
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
Multiplying variables
In order to multiply variables, you need to be familiar with the rules for multi-
plying exponents (which we discuss in Chapter 11.) The rules for multiplying 
exponents are similar to those for adding and subtracting variables; see the 
preceding two sections.
When you want to multiply variables, keep these rules in mind:
 
✓ You can multiply terms that have the same variable.
 
✓ You can’t multiply terms with different variables.
 
✓ You multiply expressions by adding the exponents and keeping the 
same base (variable).
 
✓ The order of a term’s parts doesn’t matter; you can rearrange the order 
and separate the parts.
 
A term with no indicated exponent has an invisible exponent of 1. Any item 
exponentiated (raised) to the power of 1 is itself. For example, 21 is 2 and a1 
is a. 
Multiplying simple variable terms
The most common uses of multiplying exponents in various vocations are 
square measure and cubic measure. In square measure, familiar to roofers 
and landscapers, the factors have a power of 1 and the answer has the power 
of 2. For example, length in feet multiplied by width in feet equals area in 
square feet. Cement masons and landscapers will make volume calculations, 
where one factor has a power of 1 and the other has a power of 2. For exam-
ple, area of a patio in square feet multiplied by the thickness of the concrete 
in feet equals volume in cubic feet (the power of 3). In the following example, 
both terms have the same base, so you just add the exponents m and n 
together and rewrite the result with the same base.
(am)(an) = a(m+n)
This example uses the numbers 2 and 3 for exponents in place of m and n.
(a2)(a3) = a(2+3) = a5
It’s the same story. Add the exponents. That’s multiplying in variable land.
Dealing with more complex multiplication 
Fortunately, everyday work in the trades doesn’t require computation above 
cubic measure (the power of 3). However, your education to improve your-
self or get into a trade may include complex multiplication.

192
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
The following example is an expression with multiple variables and multiple 
constants:
(3a4b7c12)(–5a9b3c4)
This example has constants and three variables. Now, reduce the expression 
to its simplest form, a form where the expression can no longer be modified 
or reduced further. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Take each of the variables and separate them from each other.
 
 Doing so makes regrouping them easier. Here’s what you end up with:
 
 (3)(a4)(b7)(c12)(–5)(a9)(b3)(c4)
 
 Notice that this spread is all one term. It has a lot of constants and 
variables but no plus or minus signs separating anything into multiple 
terms. (The “–” in “–5” isn’t functioning as a subtraction sign — it’s a 
negative sign. It’s in parentheses, and that means it’s attached to the 5.)
 
2. Regroup the like variables.
 
 You’re not doing any multiplying yet; you’re just matching everybody up 
to make the multiplication easier. In this case, you have four separate 
pieces to the equation:
 
 (3)(–5)  (a4)(a9)  (b7)(b3)  (c12)(c4)
 
3. Do the math by multiplying the constants and adding the exponents of 
the variables.
 
 Of course, you’re calculating each variable separately:
 
 (3)(–5) = –15
 
 a4+9 = a13
 
 b7+3 = b10
 
 c12+4 = c16
 
4. Reunite all the terms by rewriting the constants and variables as one 
expression.
 
 Just put the pieces back together:
 
 –15a13b10c16
 
This example is more complex than what you’re likely to find in your everyday 
work. But now you know how to tackle it if it does come up. 

193
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
Dividing variables
Dividing variables is similar to multiplying variables. The difference is that 
with division, you subtract the exponents instead of adding them. (Check out 
the preceding section for more on multiplying variables.)
In order to divide variables, make sure you’re familiar with the rules for divid-
ing exponents, which we cover in Chapter 11. The rules are similar to those 
for adding, subtracting, and multiplying variables we present in the preceding 
three sections.
When you’re dividing variables
 
✓ You can divide expressions that have the same variable.
 
✓ You can’t divide expressions with different variables.
 
✓ You divide expressions by subtracting the exponents.
 
✓ You can rearrange the order of the terms and separate the parts 
because the order doesn’t matter.
Be familiar with the difference between the numerator and the denominator 
of a fraction — variable division is written in a form that looks very similar 
to a fraction. We discuss fractions more in Chapter 8, but for now, remember 
that the numerator is the top number in a fraction and the denominator is the 
bottom number.
Tackling simple variable division
In the following example, you divide 6a by 2a. Stack the numerator over the 
denominator and reduce the fraction to its lowest possible terms.
This kind of variable division occurs every day in the trades. 
 
The variable in the denominator can’t be equal to zero. It’s impossible to 
divide by zero.
When the variable terms have exponents, you just subtract the denomina-
tor’s exponent from the numerator’s exponent. Because both terms in this 
example have the same base, you subtract the exponent n in the denomina-
tor from m in the numerator.

194
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
This example uses the numbers 5 and 3 for exponents rather than m and n.
 
Here’s a simple illustration of what this principle does. You can break the 
expression down into separate division problems:
Now, watch this trick carefully. Because 
and 
the expression simplifies to
1 × 1 × 1 × a × a or a × a or a2
Same results, but a lot more work than simply subtracting the exponents.
Diving into more complicated variable division
You don’t frequently encounter division of multiple variables in everyday 
work, but such problems can theoretically come up in surface calculations 
(for example, roof tiling or solar panel installation).This example contains 
both multiple constants and multiple variables:
Although the expression has several variables, the process for reducing it is 
relatively simple.
 
1. Separate the constants and like variables, watching out for any 
attached signs.
 
 In this example, remember to keep the negative sign with the 3⁄5 fraction.

195
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
 
 The expression breaks down into separate parts, but the mathematical 
meaning is the same.
 
 The expression doesn’t actually contain any multiplication signs, but 
using them helps to separate each of the variable terms. Just remember 
that your main goal here is division.
 
2. Divide each variable by subtracting the denominator exponent from 
the numerator exponent.
 
 We show you the a variable here:
 
 After you divide all three variables, they’re in their simplest forms.
 
3. Rewrite the expression.
 
 You have now simplified the expression to its lowest form.
Example: How Many Oranges 
Are in that Orange Juice?
A chapter without real-life problems is like a day without sunshine. Here’s 
some sunshine:
 
You’re working in an upscale hotel, and the restaurant has a novel policy of 
making orange juice from (get this) freshly squeezed oranges. Here’s what you 
need to know:
 
✓ According to the one source, an orange has about 2 ounces of juice. You 
need 3 to 4 medium oranges to make an 8-ounce glass of juice, so for this 
example, assume it takes 4 oranges.
 
✓ An orange weighs about 9 to 11 ounces. For this example, assume 
10 ounces.
 
✓ 1 U.S. gallon = 128 U.S. fluid ounces.
Your boss wants you to make one U.S. gallon of orange juice. How many 
oranges do you need?

196
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
First, evaluate the information you have. The number of 8-ounce glasses 
involved is irrelevant here. Life problems sometimes have extra information 
you don’t need. Also, an orange’s weight doesn’t really matter either, unless 
you need to go buy a quantity of oranges sold by weight.
What does matter is how many oranges (producing 2 ounces of juice each) 
you need to fill a 128-ounce gallon container. Follow this process:
 
1. Let x be the number of oranges you need.
 
 Now you’ve got one term in your equation. Not much, but it’s a start:
 
 x oranges =
 
2. Develop a constant showing the number of fluid ounces of juice per 
orange.
 
 You get 2 fluid ounces per orange, so your next term is
 
3. Put the two terms together.
 
 Now you’ve got the whole left side of the equation:
 
4. Develop an expression that represents your desired result and place it 
on the right side of the equation you started in Step 3.
 
 You know the desired result here is 128 fluid ounces, so plop that down 
on the right-hand side of the equal sign to create the full equation:
 
5. Eliminate the units and simplify the equation.
 
 What remains is
 
 x × 2 = 128 or 2x = 128
 
6. Reduce the equation.
 
 In this case, divide both sides by 2 to come up with your final answer:
 
 x = 64
 
 You need 64 oranges producing about 2 fluid ounces of juice each to 
make up a 128-fluid-ounce gallon.

197
 Chapter 12: Algebra and the Mystery of X
Converting oranges into pounds of oranges
Unfortunately, the produce supplier doesn’t deliver “by the orange.” The sup-
plier sells oranges by the pound. Because you need 64 oranges and oranges 
weigh 10 ounces, calculate how many pounds of oranges you need.
 
1. Let x be the number of pounds of oranges you need.
 
 x pounds =
 
2. Determine how many ounces 64 oranges will be when each orange 
weighs about 10 ounces.
 
 64 oranges × 10 ounces/orange = 640 ounces
 
3. Develop a constant showing the relationship between ounces and 
pounds.
 
4. Combine ounces from Step 2 with the constant from Step 3.
 
 The answer is 40 pounds.
Example: Medications In the Pillbox
 
As a certified nursing assistant (CNA), you need to place doctor-prescribed 
blood pressure medications in a container that holds the patient’s next seven 
days of medications. The blood pressure meds are
 
✓ Accupril: 40 mg tablet once daily
 
✓ Amlodipine: 5 mg capsule once daily
 
✓ Dyazide: 37.5-25 mg tablet once daily
How many pills of each kind do you need to deposit for each day? Because 
you’re filling a seven-day container, how many pills of each kind do you give 
this patient each week?
This question may seem like a trick because of its simplicity, but it helps 
demonstrate problem solving techniques. You can solve the first part of the 
problem, how many pills of each kind you need each day, by recognizing that 
one pill of each kind is required each day. In effect, the problem gives you 
the answer. This simple preliminary process is called inspection. The answer 

198
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
is that one pill of each kind is required per day. You get this from the “once 
daily” wording of the problem.
You can solve the second part of the problem, how many pills of each kind 
are required each week, in your head, but you can also represent it as an 
algebraic expression. Here’s how to set it up:
 
1. Let x be the number of Accupril tablets you need in a week and let a 
be the number of Accupril tablets provided in a day.
 
 x =
 
2. Build a simple equation.
 
 Because you know that Accupril is dispensed every day and that there 
are 7 days in a week, you can create the following equation:
 
 x = a + a + a + a + a + a + a
 
3. Add the a variables and substitute the result in the equation.
 
 That sequence looks like this:
 
 a + a + a + a + a + a + a = 7a
 
 x = 7a
 
4. Solve for x.
 
 This process is pretty simple because you know from your inspection 
that the number Accupril tablets you dispense per day is one.
 
 x = 7a = 7 × 1 = 7
It takes 7 Accupril tablets to fill the container for a week. You can use similar 
equations to determine how many Amlodipine and Dyazide pills to give out 
weekly. (Actually, because you’re giving out the same number of all three 
pills daily, you can use the exact same equation, substituting one of the other 
medicines as the value of x.)
The answers get far more interesting when the distribution of pills throughout 
the week is uneven, or when achieving the correct dosage takes multiple pills.

T
he word formula has a special meaning in mathematics, but it’s also 
everywhere in pop culture. It can mean many things, but all the uses 
of the word come from the same idea: It’s method of doing something that 
should produce the same result every time. In mathematics, a formula is a 
compact rule for getting something done mathematically. It’s the math equiv-
alent of “Never run with scissors” or “Always say please and thank you.” It 
always works.
What’s important to you is that, no matter what career you’re in, you use 
formulas to speed up math. You can use off-the-shelf formulas (and we offer 
many in this book), but from time to time you make your own. And your own 
custom formulas make your work go even better because they apply directly 
to what you’re doing.
In this chapter, you get the formula for working with formulas. You discover 
what the parts of a formula are and what alterations you can make to its 
structure by moving parts around. You also work with units in formulas and 
whip up your own home-brewed formulas.

200
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Following the Formula for 
Building a Formula
The word formula comes from the Latin word forma; formula means “little 
rule” or “little method.” A formula is usually expressed as an equation, so it 
contains an equal (=) sign. That means something (a desired result) is equal 
to something else (the factors you need to get the result).
A formula uses variables (letters) and may have constants (numbers). For 
example, you express the area of a rectangle as A = L × W, where A is the 
area, L is the length, and W is the width. The length and the width are vari-
ables, and they’re represented by letters. They can be any number. They can 
vary, and that’s why they’re called variables.
A simple example of a formula with a constant is the one that shows the 
relationship of the radius of a circle to the diameter. That formula is d = 2r. 
You say this formula as “the diameter is equal to two times the radius.” The 
radius may vary (being a variable), but the 2 is constant (being an unchang-
ing number).
Formulas have three properties you can use to manipulate them. These 
properties are 100 percent reliable, worked out and proven by professionals 
a long time ago in a galaxy far away. The properties are associativity, commu-
tativity, and distributivity. And no, we’re not making these words up as we go 
along — honest.
Formulas in the world outside math
In addition to the math meaning, a formula 
can be a recipe created by a scientist, chem-
ist, pharmacist, or chef for making something. 
One important kind of formula is infant formula, 
invented about 1867, which is supposed to con-
tain nutrients to substitute for a mother’s breast 
milk. Why it’s referred to as formula is a mystery.
The most famous scientific formula is Einstein’s 
E = mc2. Although you know it best for its role in 
nuclear reactions, it’s also a part of the math in 
particle physics and the physics of the Big Bang 
and black holes.
A formula can be a trade secret. The most 
famous secret formula is for Coca-Cola, and 
the company makes a big deal about how it’s 
locked away in a vault or about how few people 
know it. A different opinion is that the “secret” 
is more part of a great marketing campaign than 
anything else.
In movies, books, and television, a formula is 
“the same old plot,” predictable and uncon-
troversial. That’s usually what you can expect 
from situation comedies on TV (as well as, inter-
estingly enough, the 1980 movie The Formula, 
a thriller about finding a formula for artificial 
gasoline).

201
 Chapter 13: Formulas (Secret and Otherwise)
Property A: Associativity
Join the association. In a formula, how you group the terms doesn’t matter as 
long as the sequence doesn’t change. Rearranging parentheses doesn’t affect 
the value of an expression. This property works for addition and multiplica-
tion. In this example, adding 1, 2, and 3, you can write the terms two ways:
(1 + 2) + 3
1 + (2 + 3)
The 1 and 2 are associated. You add 1 and 2 first. Then add the result, 3, to 3 
to get 6. But you can also associate 2 and 3. You add 2 and 3 first. Then add 
the result, 5, to 1 to get 6.
In multiplication, you may have a similar expression:
(1 × 2) × 3
Same as the addition associativity, you can also multiply
1 × (2 × 3)
 
What about subtraction and division? Nope. The property doesn’t apply to 
subtraction or division. If you try it, it’s not guaranteed to work.
Property C: Commutativity
Commutativity isn’t an activity you do on your commute. It means that chang-
ing the order of the elements in an equation doesn’t change the result.
For example, you can use one of two formulas for putting on your shoes:
Putting shoes on = putting on left shoe + putting on right shoe
Putting shoes on = putting on right shoe + putting on left shoe
It doesn’t matter which shoe you put on first. The end result is the same. The 
same is true with addition:
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
3 + 2 + 1 = 6
2 + 1 + 3 = 6

202
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
No matter how you rearrange the terms, the answer is 6. And like its cousin 
associativity (see the preceding section), commutativity works with multipli-
cation, too.
4 × 5 × 6 = 120
6 × 5 × 4 = 120
5 × 4 × 6 = 120
No matter how you rearrange the terms, the answer is 120.
 
Commutativity applies to addition and multiplication. The property doesn’t 
apply to subtraction or division, and it’s not guaranteed to work with those 
operations.
Property D: Distributivity
Distributivity is one more key concept in working with equations. When you 
multiply one term inside parentheses by another term outside the parenthe-
ses, you can (and must) distribute the multiplication to each of the terms 
inside the parentheses. Distributivity is a common way to break down formu-
las for solutions — making the complex become simple.
The following example uses numbers. Here, you multiply a term inside paren-
theses (4 + 2) by a term outside the parentheses.
3 × (4 + 2)
Say this expression as “three times the quantity four plus two.” The conven-
tional approach is that you calculate what’s inside the parentheses first.
3 × (6) = 18
The answer is 18. But you can also distribute the multiplication to each of the 
terms inside the parentheses.
3 × (4 + 2) = 3 × (4) + 3 × (2)
3 × (4) + 3 × (2) = 12 + 6 = 18
Again, the answer is 18. It doesn’t seem dramatic at this point, but this con-
cept is a magic property — like Aladdin’s beat-up old lamp or Jack’s beans — 
when you need to break down complex equations into simpler terms.
Distributivity is also what you use when the items inside the parentheses 
aren’t the same and you can’t combine them.

203
 Chapter 13: Formulas (Secret and Otherwise)
 
In the following example, the crew wants burgers and fries for lunch. There 
are six co-workers, and each one wants one burger and two orders of fries. So 
how many of each item do you buy? You can use following spoken formula, 
but it may be misleading:
The total order is that six workers each get one burger and two orders 
of fries.
Does that mean that each worker gets one burger but you only pick up two 
orders of fries for everybody? Or does it mean that each worker gets a burger 
and each gets two orders of fries? To clear up confusion, write the order as a 
formula.
Total order = 6 workers × (1 burger + 2 fries)
Now you see two things. First, each worker wants one burger and each 
worker wants two orders of fries. Second, you see that you can’t add the 
items inside the parentheses. Burgers and fries are different units.
So you figure the total order by using the distributivity property.
Total order = (6 × 1 burger) + (6 × 2 fries)
Total order = (6 burgers) + (12 fries)
Now you can easily order 6 burgers and 12 fries at McFastfood’s. And if you 
know the item prices, you can quickly apply some money math to the two 
quantities to calculate the total cost of the order.
Working from a Formula to a Solution
An equation is a mathematical statement. It has two expressions and an equal 
sign. One expression is at the left of the equal sign, and the other is at the 
right. So the assertion is that the left side is equal to the right side.
Equations have variables (represented by letters) and constants (represented 
by numbers). If that sounds like the definition of formula from the preceding 
section, that’s because it is. Formulas are equations.
Here is an equation made up of numbers.
5 = 2 + 3

204
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Here is an equation made up of variables. It’s the formula for the area of a 
rectangle.
A = L × W
In the equation for area, A represents the area to be calculated, L represents 
the length, and W represents the width.
 
Most equations are true, but you may occasionally find a false one:
2 + 2 = 5
Formulas are always equations. When you know what’s in an equation and 
what you can do with it, you can then modify any formula to solve problems 
or adapt it to meet your special needs. The following sections show you how 
to do just that with the basic math operations (check out Chapters 4 and 5 
for more on those), as well as how to apply a special multiplication rule.
Applying the same operation on 
both sides of the equal sign
When an equation is true (and they generally are), you do math operations 
on it to make it simpler:
 
✓ Add the same quantity to both sides.
 
✓ Subtract the same quantity from both sides.
 
✓ Multiply both sides by the same quantity.
 
✓ Divide both sides by the same non-zero quantity.
 
Don’t divide by zero. It’s not allowed, and the results don’t make any sense 
anyway!
The equation still holds true as long as you do the same operation to both sides.
Adding it up
In this sample math addition equation, both sides are equal to five.
5 = 2 + 3
Now add 4 to each side.
5 + 4 = 2 + 3 + 4
9 = 9

205
 Chapter 13: Formulas (Secret and Otherwise)
Because you performed the same action on both sides, the sides are still 
equal. The same is true when you work with symbols. If you’re figuring the 
area of a floor for carpet or flooring, or a surface area for a patio, you may 
want to add some additional square feet just to be on the safe side. The for-
mula for the area of a rectangle is
A = L × W
Say you want to give yourself 12 square feet of leeway on the project. Add 12 
square feet to the answer even before you know the answer to a specific area 
problem.
A + 12 = (L × W) + 12
Both sides increase without affecting the answer. In real life, the area (A) is 
unknown, so you can actually just make the fudge factor part of the equation.
Joe’s area A = (L × W) + 12
Now you have a custom formula. It’s based on the standard formula, plus 
your allowance for extra square footage. As long as you understand why the 
extra square footage is there, you won’t have any problem.
What about subtraction?
The principle covered in the preceding section also works for subtraction. 
Both sides of this equation are equal to 2:
2 = 5 – 3
Now subtract 1 from each side.
2 – 1 = (5 – 3) – 1
1 = (2) – 1
1 = 1
Both sides are equal to 1.
Mixing in multiplication
 
You’re a manager at a concrete company. You know that each of your in-transit 
mixers (or cement trucks, as they’re popularly known) holds 8 cubic yards. 
You need enough ready-mix concrete to fill 12 trucks on Monday morning. 
How much concrete is that?

206
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
The formula is simple, as some of the best formulas are. First start with the 
basic version:
1 truck = 8 cubic yards
Multiply both sides of the equation by the same amount (12).
12 × (1 truck) = 12 × (8 cubic yards)
12 trucks = 96 cubic yards
Deceptively simple, eh? But it works. And it doesn’t just work for concrete. 
Multiplying both sides of the equation by the same amount is the basis for all 
recipe scaling. Scaling is most visible in culinary arts, especially in large food 
service establishments. It applies to sauces, beverages, pastries, and even 
the number of steaks required. The same scaling is applicable in the labora-
tory and ordering parts for manufacturing production runs.
Conquering the great divide
You divide both sides of an equation by the same amount to make it simpler. 
Just don’t divide by zero. The following kitchen management example (pies 
and slices), is the opposite of the concrete example. Just make sure your pies 
aren’t as hard as concrete.
 
You supervise food preparation in a retirement home. The boss lady tells you 
that you can get 288 slices of pie from 36 pies. How many slices should you cut 
each pie into?
 
1. Start with the formula your manager gave you.
 
 That’s 288 slices = 36 pies
That’s interesting, but not useful — you’re looking for the number of 
slices per pie.
 
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 36 to get the slices in one pie.
 
 8 slices = 1 pie
 
 The answer is 8 slices per pie.
 
You first saw the division sign (÷) in elementary school, but did you know that 
it has a name? It’s an obelus, and the plural is obeli.

207
 Chapter 13: Formulas (Secret and Otherwise)
Converting units with a special 
multiplication rule
Sometimes, the units in your formula may not match the units you use to 
order supplies. In this situation, you need a unit conversion factor to translate 
the units you have into the units you need. Luckily, using a conversion factor 
is the same as multiplying both sides of an equation by 1.
The trick here is that 1 can take many forms. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Start with the conversion formula.
 
 Say you’re a cement mason calculating a pour. You measure the pour in 
cubic feet, but you have to order the concrete in cubic yards. You start 
by noting how many cubic feet are in a cubic yard:
 
 1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet
 
2. Place the term with the units you have over the term with the units 
you need in a fraction, keeping the units intact.
 
 Because the two terms (1 cubic yard and 27 cubic feet) are equal (or 
equivalent), you can place one over the other in a fraction. Because 1 
cubic yard is equal to 27 cubic feet, this fraction is essentially the same 
as dividing 27 cubic feet by 27 cubic feet, which equals 1, as the follow-
ing equation shows.
 
 Hang onto the units! The math won’t make sense without them. After all, 
 
 Congratulations! You just made a conversion factor. Each side of the 
equation is equal to 1.
 
3. To use your conversion factor, figure out how much of a product you 
need in one unit and then create a simple conversion formula.
 
 If you’re pouring an 8 foot x 20 foot slab 4 inches (.333 feet) thick, you figure 
out the cubic feet of concrete needed. That’s 53.28 cubic feet (8 × 20 × .333). 
Then you calculate the concrete order with this simple formula:
 
V cubic yards = 53.28 cubic feet

208
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
4. Multiply both sides by 1.
 
 On the left side, use a real 1. On the right side, use the conversion factor 
from Step 2, which is equal to 1.
 
5. Simplify the equation.
 
 Notice that the cubic feet on the right cancel out because that unit 
appears in both the top and bottom of the right side of the equation.
 
 The answer is 1.973 cubic yards.
Calculating Speed, Time, and Distance: 
Three Results from One Formula
Everybody loves bargains. Imagine this one: Buy one and get two for free! 
That’s the way lots of formulas work. Many formulas have three parts, and 
when you know how to solve for one of the parts, you can reconstruct the 
formulas to solve for the other parts. This bonus is true of several area cal-
culations. It’s especially true when you convert units — length, area, volume, 
and weight. (See the preceding section for more on converting units.)
A really obvious example is when you calculate speed, time, and distance. 
If your work requires travel, especially driving, you have to deal with these 
questions:
 
✓ How fast do I have to go to get there on time?
 
✓ How long will it take to drive there?
 
✓ If I drive this fast, how much distance will I cover?
 
You can also find speed/time/distance calculators on the Internet. But where’s 
the fun in that?

209
 Chapter 13: Formulas (Secret and Otherwise)
Solving for speed
Speed is your rate of motion, and you express it in units of distance per unit 
of time — miles per hour, feet per second, and so forth. It’s the rate at which 
you’re covering distance. The formula for speed is
In the formula, v stands for velocity (speed), d stands for distance, and t 
stands for time. Now that should be easy to remember.
 
To get formal about it, speed is a scalar quantity, while velocity is a vector 
quantity. Velocity is the rate of change of position, which means it has direc-
tion. Speed is direction-independent and is just the magnitude of the velocity 
vector. You express both in the same units (miles per hour, kilometers per 
hour, feet per second, meters per second, and so forth). As a nonmathemati-
cian, you use the terms interchangeably.
Here’s one of those “solve it in your head” examples. If you drive 55 miles in 
one hour, what’s your speed? Put your data into the formula.
Separate the units from the number.
Your speed is 55 miles per hour. This calculation gets more complex, of 
course, when the time is an odd amount (for example, 2.46 hours) or appears 
as non-hourly units (37 minutes). You may have to do some conversion, but 
after you do, the formula works fine.
 
Solving for speed and its cousins, time and distance, is a frequent compo-
nent of technical work. The worlds of time/distance/speed, money, and time 
expended may seem secondary, but in professional work, they’re always 
important and always there.
Solving for time
When you know the formula for calculating speed (covered in the preceding 
section), you can easily convert it into a valuable formula where the unknown 
is time. Just follow these easy steps:

210
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
1. Start with what you know, the formula for speed.
 
2. Multiply both sides of the equation by t.
 
 vt = d
 
3. Divide both sides of the equation by v.
The formula for finding time (when you know distance and speed) is distance 
divided by speed.
Solving for distance
But wait! There’s more! What they say in the infomercials applies to the cal-
culation of time/distance/speed. In addition to the formulas in the preceding 
sections, one more formula makes the time/distance/speed formula handier 
than a Ginsu knife. Here’s how you develop the formula for distance.
 
1. Start with what you know, the formula for speed.
 
2. Multiply both sides of the equation by t.
 
 vt = d
 
3. Write the equation with d on the left and the factors v and t on the 
right.
 
 d = vt
 
 Distance is equal to speed multiplied by time.
 
A quick conversion: If you drive at 60 miles per hour (where legal, of course), 
you travel 60 miles in 1 hour or 1 mile in 1 minute. At this speed, you can 
easily figure that you’ll drive (for example) 35 miles in 35 minutes.

211
 Chapter 13: Formulas (Secret and Otherwise)
That’s all you need to do. One formula produces three formulas for you. 
When you know the formula for speed, you get the time for nothing and the 
distance is free (apologies to Dire Straits here).
Example: Cement Masonry — 
Pouring City Sidewalks
 
You’re a cement contractor in Riverside, Illinois, about 15 miles west of 
Chicago. Your company gets a lot of work from the city for its sidewalk 
replacement program.
Sidewalks are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and 
are 60 inches wide. Although sidewalks must be thicker where they cross 
driveways, you’re interested in the majority of sidewalks on public land, 
which must be 5 inches thick.
How many yards of concrete do you need for a 50 foot run? Based on the 
results of that calculation, what’s the approximate amount of concrete you 
need for each running foot of sidewalk? Develop a custom formula for each 
calculation.
 
1. Start with the formula you know for figuring volume of a rectangular 
space.
 
V = L × W × H
 
 The volume (V) is equal to the length (L) multiplied by the width (W) 
multiplied by the height (H). The height of a sidewalk is its thickness.
 
2. Convert the units to feet.
 
 You know the length you want in feet — 50 feet. You know the width and 
height, but those dimensions are in inches, so you need to use a conver-
sion factor.
 
 Watch your units. Otherwise, you may get a lot more concrete than you 
ever dreamed of delivered to the building site.
 
 The width of the sidewalk is 5 feet, the thickness is .417 feet, and the 
length is 50 feet. Now you’re ready to calculate.

212
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
3. Insert your information in the formula and calculate.
 
 V in cubic feet = 50 feet × 5 feet × .417 feet
 
 V in cubic feet = 104.25 cubic feet
 
 The answer, in cubic feet, is 104.25. But you want to know how many 
cubic yards to order.
 
4. To convert to cubic yards, use the cubic feet to cubic yard conversion 
factor from earlier in this chapter.
 
 The answer is 3.86 cubic yards (or “yards,” as they say) to pour 50 feet 
of sidewalk 5 feet wide and 5 inches thick.
 
5. To figure out how much concrete you need for 1 running foot of con-
crete, just divide your Step 4 total by 50.
 
 The answer is 0.0772 cubic yards per running foot. Congratulations! You 
now have you own custom formula or conversion factor. If, for example, 
someone wants to know how much concrete to order for a 22 foot run, 
just multiply 22 by your factor of 0.0772. (By the way, that answer is 
1.698 cubic yards.)
Example: Lunch Time — Buying 
Burgers and Fries
 
Man (and woman) doth not live by work alone. Nor do they live by math alone. 
Sometimes, they must eat lunch.
Whether you’re on a construction crew, working in a lab, or coaching youth 
soccer, eventually you get tagged to go get the food (unless you work in the 
culinary arts; you can probably eat the food right where you work).

213
 Chapter 13: Formulas (Secret and Otherwise)
Okay, so you’re the lucky one to go to Burger Duke to buy the lunch. You 
have three kinds of eaters with three kinds of appetites:
 
✓ Big eaters want two Godzilla hamburgers and three orders of fries.
 
✓ Regular eaters want one Godzilla hamburger and two orders of fries.
 
✓ Snackers want no hamburger but one order of fries.
For this example, say you have three big eaters, four regular eaters, and two 
snackers. Develop a formula that reduces the food order to its simplest terms 
and then determine how many of each food product you need.
 
1. Write a formula for the total order.
 
 Write down all the information you have — any or all parts of the prob-
lem may come in handy:
 
 Total order = Big eater orders + Regular eater orders + Snacker orders
 
2. Substitute symbols for the words for the eaters.
 
 This step makes the math easier. Let T equal the total order, B represent 
big eaters, R represent regular eaters, and S represent snackers. Rewrite 
the formula:
 
 T = B + R + S
 
3. Write formulas for the contents of each type of order
 
 Big eater order = 2 hamburgers and 3 fries
 
 Regular eater order = 1 hamburger and 2 fries
 
 Snacker order = 0 hamburgers and 1 fries
 
4. Substitute symbols for the food product words and rewrite the 
formulas.
 
 Let h represent hamburgers and f represent fries.
 
 B = 2h + 3f
 
 R = 1h + 2f = h + 2f
 
 S = 0h + 1f = 1f = f
 
 Note: It’s okay to write zero hamburgers as 0h. Multiplying anything 
by 0 is 0, and this term drops out of the equation. You’re also allowed 
to write one hamburger as 1h and one fries as 1f because multiplying a 
number or symbol by 1 is that number. But it’s better to drop the 1; it’s 
a common convention of algebra not to include the 1.
 
 The B, R, and S symbols each represent a different combination of ham-
burgers and fries for the three kinds of eaters.

214
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
5. Rewrite the initial “T =” formula by using the “recipes” for the three 
types of eaters.
 
 T = B(2h + 3f) + R(h + 2f) + S(f)
 
 This formula is the mathematical representation of how you determine 
the lunch order. You need only to insert the number of each kind of 
eater, and you have the results.
 
6. Insert the number of each kind of eater and multiply.
 
 Use distributivity:
 
 T = 3(2h + 3f) + 4(h + 2f) + 2(f)
 
 T = (6h + 9f) + (4h + 8f) + (2f)
 
7. Use associativity and commutativity to rearrange the items.
 
 Group the hamburgers together and group the fries together. Get rid of 
the parentheses and add up the like quantities — the hs and the fs
 
 T = 6h + 9f + 4h + 8f + 2f
 
 T = 6h + 4h + 9f + 8f + 2f
 
 T = (6h + 4h) + (9f + 8f + 2f)
 
 T = 10h + 19f
 
 The total order (T) is 10 hamburgers (10h) and 19 fries (19f). Collect the 
money and head on out. On the drive, prepare your answer for the most 
baffling question regarding large fast food orders: “Is that to eat here or 
take out?”
 
This story problem isn’t trivial. “Burgers and fries” is an analog for any part 
management or piece management math where you need to find total quanti-
ties from individual kits or make up various individual kits from storeroom 
inventory.

▶ Investigating the world-famous Pythagorean theorem
I
t’s useful to know a little geometry, and that’s what this chapter 
 contains — a little geometry. Geometry is the branch of mathematics 
that deals with the details of shapes.
Geometry is important because it’s conceptual; it improves your thinking. 
It’s part of a full program of math studies, and it has lots of good vocabulary 
words. And geometry is visual, unlike algebra and trigonometry, so it’s easier 
to grasp. But above all, geometric concepts and words come up in your 
everyday work.
A flat surface, such as a piece of paper, is called a plane, and basic geometry 
is also called plane geometry. You can find other geometries besides plane 
geometry, such as solid geometry, spherical geometry, Riemannian geometry, 
Poincaré geometry, and taxicab geometry, which aren’t (mercifully) part of 
this chapter.
In this chapter, you review the basic parts of basic geometry — points, lines, 
angles, planes, and a coordinate system. And you get the straight skinny 
about the centerpiece of geometry, the Pythagorean theorem. (Just saying 
“Pythagorean theorem” makes you feel instantly smarter.)

216
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Looking at Geometry’s Basic Parts
Half of life is knowing what things are called. The other half of life is knowing 
how things work. Geometry has just a few terms and a few operations. The 
basic parts (what things are called) are the point, the line, and the angle, plus 
the plane to draw them on. Finally, you use a coordinate system to describe 
just where on the plane the parts are located.
Table 14-1 shows where some of these parts fit in dimensional space with 
other parts:

The many meanings of geometry
Geometry comes from the Greek geo meaning 
“earth” and metria meaning “measurement.” 
It started off as earth measurement and then 
extended to the positions of the planets and the 
stars. A Greek named Euclid of Alexandria put 
geometry on the map around 300 BC. He wrote 
a work called Elements, which became the 
world’s bestselling nonreligious work. Euclid 
set the standard, and to this day geometry is 
also known as Euclidean geometry.
Today, geometry means different things to dif-
ferent people. Geometry can be
 ✓ The part of your earlier education where 
you and math parted ways. Did you leave 
geometry or did geometry leave you?
 ✓ A very useful skill in several careers, 
including carpentry (especially high-end 
woodworking), graphic design, bricklaying, 
surveying, and even cosmetology (faces 
have geometric shapes).
 ✓ A more sophisticated look at the world than 
simple shapes and areas (head to Chapter 
15 for more on this topic).
 ✓ An important steppingstone to trigonometry 
(which we cover in Chapter 16).

217
 Chapter 14: Quick-and-Easy Geometry: The Compressed Version
In Table 14-1, you see volume and time as the third and fourth dimensions. 
We cover the practical side of these operations in Chapters 15 and 18, so we 
only deal with them here as they relate to the trades.
 
A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. 
However, a scientist who works in the field of temperature is not called a 
 thermometer.
No snakes on this plane: 
Cartesian coordinates
A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface. It’s theoretical, and that means it’s 
perfectly flat and extends forever in all directions. In real life, you draw geo-
metric figures on a flat piece of paper or a flat computer screen.
A coordinate system is a way of describing the position of any object on a 
plane. The most famous and commonly-used coordinate system is Cartesian 
coordinates. (That’s car-teez-e-an.) Figure 14-1 shows the Cartesian coordi-
nate system.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Cartesian 
coordinate 
system.

The system has two axes (that’s plural for axis). The horizontal axis is the X 
axis, and the vertical axis is the Y axis. Along each axis are points, and the 
two axes cross each other at point (0,0). That’s the origin. As a bonus, you 
get four quadrants, named I, II, III, and IV.
You can describe any position on the plane by naming coordinates. In 
Figure 14-1, the point is at coordinate (5,4). The two coordinates form an 
ordered pair.

218
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Are you coordinated? You may be in strange territory with a coordinate 
system, except that coordinate systems are all around you:
 
✓ Just about every real estate agent and delivery person has used a Thomas 
Guide at one time or another. This elaborate, multipage map has coordi-
nates on every page. In many ways, the Thomas Guide is better than a GPS.
 
✓ Even if you haven’t used Thomas maps, you may have used maps from 
an automobile club. They have coordinates around the edge of the map. 
The street you want is somewhere in square G-3.
 
✓ If you’ve ever used a GPS for work or for your hobby of geocaching, 
you’ve used a coordinate system where positions around the earth are 
expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds.
 
✓ If you live in an urban center where the streets are on a grid, you’re 
using a coordinate system. If you tell people that you live at 23rd and N 
in midtown Sacramento, California, you’re saying that you’re about 19 
blocks down and 23 blocks over from the start of the grid.
What’s the point?
The point is the starting . . . er . . . point for all geometry. A point is an object 
with zero dimensions. Euclid said a point was “that which has no part.” It has no 
length, height, or thickness. All it has to show for its trouble is a coordinate. For 
example, (0,0), (5,3) and (29.5645,56.1) are all points in a coordinate system.
A point is the smallest and most precise entity in geometry. It’s pivotal to 
using all the other entities: the ray, the line segment, the angle, the curve, 
and the geometric shape. The point always represents the smallest, sharpest, 
or most fundamental unit in your activities. Here is a partial list of points you 
use in work and life:
 
✓ Smallest unit of measurement for a gemstone
 
✓ Smallest unit of measurement for the thickness of paper
 
✓ A part of a home loan
 
✓ A separator in decimal numbers
 
✓ The sharp end of a pencil
 
✓ The lead soldier in a combat patrol
 
✓ A projection of land into the ocean
 
✓ A direction on a compass
 
✓ A unit in scoring games

 Chapter 14: Quick-and-Easy Geometry: The Compressed Version
What’s your line?
A line is a geometric element with 1 dimension, length. It has no thickness 
and no height. The line is a big advance over the point, although the line 
denies using steroids.
In geometry, a line is conceptual, not real, so it’s infinitely long and perfectly 
straight. Figure 14-2 shows a line and two variations.
 
Figure 14-2: 
A line 
and two 
 variations.
 
Line
Line segment
Ray
The first element in Figure 14-2 is a line. It’s infinitely long, and that’s why it has 
two arrowheads. If this book were infinitely wide, you’d see the whole line.
The second element in Figure 14-2 is a line segment, which is a portion of a 
line. Each end of a line segment has a coordinate, such as (0,0) and (3,4). Line 
segments make up squares, rectangles, triangles, and other geometric shapes 
(which we cover later in the chapter).
The third element in Figure 14-2 is a ray. It’s a mix of line segment and line. 
It has a starting point, but the other end goes to infinity. You use rays to 
describe angles formally.
Parallel lines are two lines that go on side by side forever and never meet. 
Perpendicular lines are two lines that meet at a 90-degree angle, which we just 
so happen to discuss in the following section.
What’s your angle?: Acute, 
obtuse, and right angles
Put on your tuxedo and get ready for something formal. In geometry, for-
mally, an angle is a figure with two rays joined at the same endpoint. (Check 
out the preceding section for more on rays.) The endpoint is called the 
vertex. The size or amount of the angle is called the magnitude. Figure 14-3 
illustrates an angle.

Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry

an angle.

The angle in the illustration is called a. Sometimes textbooks give the angles 
as Greek letters. In this example, it’s theta (θ).
You also call the angle in the illustration BAC, because BAC summarizes the 
points that make it up. A is the vertex. B and C are points on the rays. You 
write this name as ∠BAC or ∠CAB. The vertex point is always in the middle.
The magnitude of the angle in the illustration is 30 degrees (30°). The magni-
tude is the portion of a circle (360 degrees) that the angle sweeps through. 
There’s another system of measurement, called radians, but you aren’t likely 
to encounter radian measurement.
 
If you’re a carpenter, you use angles when you determine roof pitch (also 
called slope or angle), but you express the angle differently. If you frame 
a “7/12” roof, the roof rises 7 inches for every 12 inches it runs. You may also 
call it a pitch of “7-12,” “7 to 12,” “7 and 12,” or “7 on 12.” No matter what you 
call it, the pitch has an angle of 30.5 degrees. Similarly, surveyors and heavy 
equipment operators (road builders) deal with angles in road grade inclines 
and declines, but their terminology includes the word grade, not angle. 
A 5-percent grade rises 5 feet for each 100 feet of travel, or about 264 feet in a 
mile. A 5-percent grade has an angle of 2.9 degrees.
 
You can calculate roof pitch and road grade using trigonometry (see 
Chapter 16), but you get it faster using Internet calculators.
Angles have special names. The three common angles you encounter:
 
✓ Acute angles (less than 90 degrees) are sharp angles.
 
✓ Right angles (exactly 90 degrees) are square corners. They’re marked by 
a little box in the angle, as you can see in Figure 14-4.
 
✓ Obtuse angles (more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees) are dull 
angles.
Figure 14-4 shows several types of angles.

The examples of straight, reflex, and full rotation angles in Figure 14-4 illus-
trate other angle possibilities. However, acute, right, and obtuse angles make 
up 99.999 percent of the work you do in real life and math classes. Many 
other angle types exist, but they’re meaningful mainly to mathematicians.
 
If you’ve got to know, the other angle types include oblique angles, congruent 
angles, vertical angles, adjacent angles, complementary angles, supplemen-
tary angles, explementary (or conjugate) angles, interior angles and exterior 
angles.
Examining Simple Geometric Shapes
A simple geometric shape is a two-dimensional shape that consist of points, 
lines, curves, and planes. There are many geometric shapes (hundreds, in 
fact), but the shapes you use in everyday work (and we cover in the following 
sections) are the square, rectangle, triangle, and circle.
The square and the rectangle
Speaking formally, a square is a rectangular quadrilateral geometric shape. 
It has four equal sides and four equal angles, which are always right angles. 
A square is a special kind of rectangle.
So what’s a rectangle? It has two sets of sides (two equal sides for length and 
two equal sides for height), but unlike the square, its length and width aren’t 
always equal to each other. The angles are right angles.
Figure 14-5 shows a square and a rectangle.

The small boxes in the corners indicate right angles. If you write labels A, B, 
C, and D at the corners, you then refer to the figures as ABCD.
The triangle: Just because it isn’t a right 
triangle doesn’t mean it’s wrong
A triangle is a simple geometric shape with three sides (well, line segments). 
A triangle contains three angles, which certainly explains the name triangle.
Since ancient times, triangles (along with squares and rectangles) have been 
used to lay out fields for farming — and to measure them for taxes. (You can 
find more on measuring the area of a triangle in Chapter 15.) Like angles, tri-
angles have special names. In fact some of the triangle names are identical to 
angle names. Figure 14-6 shows several types of triangles.

The examples in the figure show every condition you encounter with triangles. 
If a triangle doesn’t behave like one of those samples, it’s not a triangle.
 
✓ Acute triangles have three acute angles.
 
✓ Right triangles have one 90-degree angle.
 
✓ Obtuse triangles have one angle that’s more than 90 degrees.
 
✓ Isosceles triangles have two equal angles.
 
✓ Equilateral triangles have three equal (60-degree) angles.
 
✓ Scalene triangles have three different angles.
The first triangle in Figure 14-6 is labeled ABC. You express the triangle’s 
name with a small triangle sign (that is, ABC) and the letters ABC.
 
A right triangle is part of the Pythagorean theorem, and it has special names 
for its parts. The two sides next to the right angle are the legs and the diago-
nal is called the hypotenuse. Check out “Learn It Once and Forget It: The 
Pythagorean Theorem” later in the chapter for more on this formula.
The polygon
A polygon isn’t a parrot who flew the coop. It’s a figure with many sides. A reg-
ular polygon has equal angles and equal sides. An irregular polygon has sides 
of different lengths and angles with different values. You can find other types 
of polygons, too, including concave and star-shaped. Figure 14-7 illustrates 
several regular polygons and one irregular polygon.
 
Figure 14-7: 
Regular and 
irregular 
polygons.
 
3 sides
4 sides
5 sides
6 sides

Irregular
You use a few polygons so much that they have common names. For example:
 
✓ A five-sided regular polygon is a pentagon. That’s also the name of a very 
large five-sided office building in Washington, D.C.
 
✓ A six-sided polygon is a hexagon. It’s also the shape of each cell in a 
bee’s honeycomb.
 
✓ An eight-sided polygon is an octagon.

224
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Now when you drive down the road, you can point to the signs and shout, 
“That stop sign is an octagon!” Unfortunately, this valuable piece of math 
information may not make you any more popular with friends and may dis-
turb strangers.
The circle
A circle is a curved geometric shape where every point on the curve is an 
equal distance from a fixed point called the center. Circles are everywhere: 
the sun, the moon, bowls, plates, tires and steering wheels, just to name a 
few. Figure 14-8 shows the parts of a circle.

Center
The circle has the following parts:
 
✓ The circumference is the length of the line segment that constitutes the 
circle. It’s the distance around the circle.
 
✓ The diameter is the distance across the circle through the center.
 
✓ The radius is the distance from the center to the edge of the circle.
The great thing about a circle is that when you know the radius you know the 
diameter (it’s twice as much), and when you know the diameter you know the 
radius (it’s half as much).
When you multiply the diameter by pi (π) you know the circumference. When 
you divide the circumference by pi, you know the diameter.
When you know the radius, square it and multiply by pi, you know the area of 
the circle. Chapter 15 has the details on finding area.

225
 Chapter 14: Quick-and-Easy Geometry: The Compressed Version
By convention, a circle has 360 degrees (the same unit of measure you use 
for angles). A 90-degree angle sweeps one quarter of a circle, a 180-degree 
angle sweeps half, and a 360-degree angle (full rotation in Figure 14-4 earlier 
in the chapter) is a full circle. Flip to “What’s your angle?: Acute, obtuse, and 
right angles” earlier in the chapter for more on angles.
Learn It Once and Forget It: 
The Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean (that’s puh-thag-o-re-an) theorem is important to know, 
mostly for educational reasons. It shows you a bit of geometry that’s sup-
ported by algebraic analysis, and it’s the first of several more sophisticated 
algebra, geometry, and trigonometry principles you may need as part of your 
professional education. It’s part of the pathway to greater understanding of 
and comfort with math. Later, you may use the theorem occasionally in a 
surveying-related career, but for many other careers, you may not need it 
again. It’s important to understand, but not important to remember.
The Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of the squares of a right tri-
angle’s leg lengths is equal to the square of the length of its hypotenuse. 
Figure 14-9 shows a classic view of the theorem.

Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
In Figure 14-9, the a2 represents the square of length a. And b2 is the square of 
length b. Also, c2 is the square of side c, the hypotenuse.
In algebra, you write
a2 + b2 = c2
And (drum roll, please) after you add a2 and b2 to get c2, you then calculate 
the square root of c2 to find the length of the hypotenuse.
Thanks to the various basics of math, the following two algebra equations are 
also true:
a2 = c2 – b2
b2 = c2 – a2
Bottom line: If you know the lengths of two sides of a right triangle, you can 
easily calculate the length of the third side.
Try this concept for yourself. In Figure 14-10, one leg has a length of 2 and the 
other leg has a length of 4. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse by using 
the Pythagorean theorem.

Play it again, Samos
Pythagoras (c. 570–c. 495 BC), the creator of the 
Pythagorean theorem, was born on the island 
of Samos. But he’s not its only famous native 
son. The Greek philosopher Epicurus was born 
on Samos in 341 BC, and famous fabler Aesop 
(620–560 BC) may also have been born on 
Samos, too. He certainly lived there.
The Pythagorean theorem has been proved for-
mally many times by skilled mathematicians in 
all the ages. What people don’t know is that as a 
young man U.S. President James A. Garfield did 
a clever and unusual proof of the Pythagorean 
theorem, called the trapezoidal proof. Before 
he got into politics, Garfield was an outstand-
ing student.
The theorem even has its place in classic film. 
Take a look at this great quotation from “The 
Wizard of Oz” (1939).
 
 Scarecrow: The sum of the square roots 
of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is 
equal to the square root of the remaining 
side. Oh joy! Rapture! I got a brain! How 
can I ever thank you enough?
 
 Wizard: You can’t.
Of course, the Scarecrow had the Pythagorean 
theorem completely wrong, but don’t let that 
ruin your enjoyment of the movie.

You have most of the dimensions for the four pastures, and they’re easy 
enough to add up. But what about that diagonal (marked ??? in the figure)? 
How long is it? Here’s how you find out:
 
1. Recognize that the pasture in question is in the shape of a right 
 triangle and that you want to know the length of its hypotenuse.
 
 Your Pythagorean theorem alarm should be going off — that’s the for-
mula you need here.
 
2. Determine the values you need to use and insert them into the formula.
 
 One leg of the triangle is 400 feet. The other leg of the triangle is also 
400 feet, so input those into the formula.
 
 c2 = 4002 + 4002
 
3. Calculate the value of c2.
 
 c2 = 160,000 + 160,000 = 320,000.
 
4. Use a calculator to find the square root of c2.
 
 c = 565.7 feet
 
 The fencing run for the diagonal part of the pasture is 565.7 feet.
Example: The Pen Is Mightier 
Than the Paddock
 
The client from the preceding section also wants a three-rail vinyl fence for 
a 50-foot, circular exercise pen. How much rail should you get to do the job?
Figure 14-12 shows the exercise pen.

1. Recognize that you’re installing fence for a round plot and therefore 
need to find the circumference.
 
 You know you can use the formula c = πd when you know the pen’s 
diameter.
 
2. Insert the diameter and the value of pi in the formula and calculate 
the value of c.
 
 Use 3.14159 for pi.
 
 c = 3.14159 × 50
 
 c = 157 feet
 
 That’s the circumference. It takes 157 feet of rail to put one rail around 
the pen.
 
3. Multiply the circumference by three to account for the three rails of 
the fence.
 
 This fencing run calls for three rails; use the formula.
 
 Total feet of rail = 157 feet/rail × 3 rails
 
 You need 471 feet of rail.

Calculating Areas, Perimeters, 
and Volumes
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying shapes and calculating their areas by using easy formulas
▶ Knowing the parameters of perimeters (and figuring out their lengths)
▶ Performing volume calculations
A
 lot of math (technical and otherwise) is about calculating areas, 
perimeters, and volumes. Those calculations can be fun, easy, and 
very useful. For example, computing areas is right at the core of the building 
trades. If you do carpentry, concrete, painting, carpeting, or drywall, you use 
area calculations a lot. You work with perimeters in fashion technology, land-
scaping, and fence installation, among other fields.
The lab tech, the cosmetologist, the brewer, and the chef deal with volumes 
more than other careers do, but they aren’t the only ones. Automotive tech-
nicians have to know how to figure engine capacity, and cement masons need 
to know concrete volumes.
There are two wonderful things, in particular, about areas, perimeters, and 
volumes. The first is that the handiest, most important calculations are the 
easiest ones. The second is that you grew up with some of the basic shapes 
they deal with, so you’ve got a head start.
In this chapter, you review the entire length and width of areas, work your 
way around perimeters, and explore the not-so-voluminous world of volumes.
Area: All That Space in the Middle
An area is a region surrounded by a closed curve (an entity with a continuous 
border, like a square, a rectangle, a triangle, or a circle). Figure 15-1 shows 
closed and open curves.

232
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
Figure 15-1: 
Closed 
and open 
curves.
 
Closed curves
Open curves
Even if the shape you’re looking at is all made up of straight lines, it’s still 
technically a closed curve. And that means you can calculate its area.
 
In mathematics classes, an area is usually just a number, but in real life, you 
have to attach units of measurement. For example, you express carpeting 
and floor areas in square feet. A printer expresses paper density in grams per 
square meter (g/m2). If you’re surveying or mapping, you use square miles, 
sections, and townships. Flip to Chapter 6 for other units of square measure.
 
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Public Land Survey 
System started soon after the Revolutionary War. Over the past two centuries, 
almost 1.5 billion acres in the United States have been surveyed into townships 
and sections. A section is one square mile and contains 640 acres. Thirty-six 
sections make up a township of 36 square miles.
 
When you do real-life area calculations, make sure that every unit of measure-
ment is the same. If you’re calculating the area of a square and encounter one 
side measurement in feet and the other side measurement in yards, you need to 
convert one of the units before you start calculating. Chapter 6 shows you how.
Calculating the area of rectangles 
and squares
A rectangle is a region with four sides and four 90-degree angles. The two 
length sides (long sides) have equal measurements, and the two width sides 
(short sides) are equal to each other as well. Figure 15-2 shows a rectangle.
 
Figure 15-2: 
A rectangle.
 
Width
Length

233
 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
The area formula for a rectangle is length multiplied by width. You say this 
statement as “Area equals length times width.” You write it as
Area = Length × Width
A = L × W
 
You encounter many rectangles when you calculate paint for interior walls. 
For example, a walk-in closet wall may be 6 feet wide and 8 feet tall. Figure 15-3 
shows the wall.
 
Figure 15-3: 
A wall in 
a walk-in 
closet.
 
6 feet
8 feet
 
In Figure 15-3, we play fast and loose with terms like length, width, and height. 
As long as one of your dimensions is the L dimension required by the area for-
mula and one is the W dimension, the calculation comes out the same.
Find the area of Figure 15-3 by plugging those measurements into the formula 
for the area of a rectangle.
A = 6 feet × 8 feet
A = 48 square feet
Of course, any interior painting job likely involves several walls in a room 
and several rooms in a house, plus ceilings. Having a handle on the basic area 
calculation allows you to calculate the full area you’re painting to help you 
determine how much paint you need.
 
The good news (if you’re a painter, anyway) is that you can use shortcuts. A 
professional house painter may calculate area based on the total lengths of all 
the walls in a house and assume a height of eight feet.
 
Painting isn’t the only real-life situation where you may encounter rectangle-
area calculations. If you go into business for yourself and rent office space, 
you rent by the square foot. If you buy a house, the listing and the appraisal 
reflect square feet. Square footage is also important when you calculate (for 
income tax purposes) the portion of your home used for office space.
A square is a special rectangle that has four equal sides; it’s the only rectan-
gle where the length and width are the same. Figure 15-4 shows a square.

234
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
Figure 15-4: 
A square.
 
Width
Length
To figure the area of a square, you recycle the formula for the area of a rect-
angle: A = L × W.
 
Figure 15-5 applies to a small room that needs carpeting or flooring, or a tiny 
patio that needs a concrete slab.
 
Figure 15-5: 
A room or 
a patio.

You have the formula and you have the dimensions. You can now use the 
time-honored mathematical method of “plug and chug” to get the answer.
A = 6 feet × 6 feet
A = 36 square feet
Figuring the area of a parallelogram 
(a bent-over long rectangle)
A parallelogram is a region with four sides. The two length sides are equal to 
each other and the other two sides are equal to each other, which makes the 
opposite sides parallel to each other.
If you’re asking yourself why a parallelogram isn’t a rectangle (see the preceding 
section), remember that a rectangle requires four right angles. A parallelogram 
doesn’t have 90-degree angles — it looks like a squooshed rectangle. Figure 15-6 
shows a parallelogram.
 
Figure 15-6: 
A parallelo-
gram.
 
Base
Height

235
 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
The formula for the area of a parallelogram is a slight variation of the formu-
las for squares and rectangles: You multiply the base (B) by the height (H). 
You say this calculation as “Area equals base times height” and write it as
Area = Base × Height
A = B × H
Calculating with the length of the short side won’t get you there. The height 
(the distance from the base to its opposite side) is what matters.
 
You don’t encounter a surface that’s an exact parallelogram every day, but 
some patios, driveways, and walkways come pretty darned close. If three 
sides match those of a parallelogram, you can (hypothetically) make the 
fourth side into the fourth “correct” side as shown in Figure 15-7. In technical 
terms, this tactic is called “cheating” or “pretending.”
Figure 15-7 shows the shape of a new patio to be poured. It abuts an existing 
circular swimming pool and is approximately the shape of a parallelogram.
 
Figure 15-7: 
A patio 
in the shape 
of a paral-
lelogram.
 
20 feet
6 feet
The parallelogram isn’t perfect, but it’s close enough to what you need to 
allow you to fudge to get an area. Using the measurements from Figure 15-7 
and the formula for the area of a parallelogram, you now find the area.
A = 20 feet × 6 feet
A = 120 square feet
Determining the area of a trapezoid 
(a trapewhat?)
A trapezoid, that’s what. A trapezoid is a region with four sides, but it has only 
one set of parallel sides (called the bases). Figure 15-8 shows a trapezoid.

236
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
Figure 15-8: 
A trapezoid.
 
Base (a)
Base (b)
Height (h)
Finding the area of a trapezoid takes a little more information than finding 
the area of a rectangle or a parallelogram does. (We cover those shapes in 
the preceding sections.) You need to know the length of both of the bases 
(labeled a and b in Figure 15-8) and the height (labeled h in Figure 15-8).
Like in a parallelogram, the trapezoid’s height is important; however, you cal-
culate the average length of the two bases for a trapezoid.
In a trapezoid, area equals height times half the sum of Base a and Base b. 
And that’s the way you say it, too.
Figure 15-9 shows a trapezoid with its dimensions marked.
 
Figure 15-9: 
A trap-
ezoid with 
 dimensions.
 
12 feet
8 feet
5 feet
Because you know the information for this trapezoid, plug that information 
into the formula to find the area.

237
 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
Calculating the area of a triangle
A triangle is a three-sided figure with three angles, such as the one shown in 
Figure 15-10. Math people used to say that a triangle was just half of a rect-
angle, but that’s not always the case. If you have an obtuse triangle (a triangle 
where one angle is more than 90 degrees) or an acute triangle (where all 
angles are less than 90 degrees), the triangle is half a parallelogram, not a rect-
angle. Only a right triangle (a triangle with one angle of 90 degrees) is half a 
rectangle. (Check out Chapter 14 for more on the various kinds of triangles.)
 
Figure 15-10: 
A triangle.
 
Base (b)
Height (h)
 
Figuring the areas of triangles can come up in real estate or surveying when 
you determine lot sizes. The size of the lot can be very important in towns 
with strong zoning commissions because the property area devoted to park-
ing is often a critical issue.
Just like your favorite recipes and a few home cures for the cold, the formula 
for figuring out a triangle’s area is simple: Area equals one-half the product of 
the base and the height. You write this formula as
Figure 15-11 shows you a sample triangle with its dimensions labeled.
A quadrilateral family tree
Rectangles, squares, parallelograms, and 
trapezoids are all quadrilaterals, which means 
they’re four-sided polygons. Here is the 
 genealogy of the family headed by the quad-
rilateral: A trapezoid is a special offshoot of 
a quadrilateral — two sides are parallel. A 
 parallelogram is a special offshoot of a trap-
ezoid — it has equal, parallel opposite sides. 
A rectangle is a special offshoot of a paral-
lelogram — it has right angles. A square is a 
special offshoot of a rectangle — it has right 
angles and equal sides.

238
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
Figure 15-11: 
A triangle

You know the formula and the dimensions, so just calculate.
 
The mathematical mind loves names, and triangles are no exception; the list 
of triangle names rivals the flavors in a small ice cream parlor: equilateral 
triangles, isosceles triangles, scalene triangles, right triangles, acute triangles, 
and obtuse triangles.
Computing the area of a circle
A circle is a curved region with an equal distance from a fixed point (the center) 
to any point on the edge. A circle is the simplest area you’ll ever do. You need 
only one measurement: the radius. The radius is the distance from the center 
of the circle to any point on the curved edge of the circle; it’s the distance 
halfway across a circle. The full distance across (through the center) is called 
the diameter. It just happens to be twice the length of the radius, so when you 
know the diameter, you can easily get the radius. Figure 15-12 illustrates a 
circle with its radius.
 
Figure 15-12: 
A circle with 
its radius.
 
Radius
In addition to the radius, you also need pi (a Greek letter pronounced “pie” 
and represented by the symbol π) to calculate a circle’s area. Pi is called a 
mathematical constant because its value doesn’t change.

239
 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
It’s an oval! It’s an egg! No, it’s an ellipse
An ellipse is like a circle, but it’s not. Like a 
circle, it’s a region surrounded by a closed 
curve, but it’s taller or shorter than it is wide. 
It’s a squooshed circle. The formula for calcu-
lating the area of an ellipse is similar to that for 
a circle.
 
 A = π × a × b or A = πab
In the formula, a is the semi-major axis and b is 
the semi-minor axis, which you can see in the 
following figure. The semi-major axis is one half 
of the major axis (the total length of the ellipse). 
The semi-minor axis is one half of the minor axis 
(the total height of the ellipse).
a
b
Semi-major axis
Semi-minor axis
A famous ellipse in the U.S. is a giant lawn or 
green in President’s Park in Washington, D.C. 
It’s about 17 acres in area, with a length of 
1,058.26 feet and a width of 902.85 feet. That 
may make it the largest ellipse in the world.
 
Your calculator may have a π key. If it doesn’t, use 3.14159, which is an 
approximation.
The formula for finding a circle’s area is simple: Area equals pi times the 
radius squared. You write this calculation as
Area = π × radius squared
A = π × r2 or A = π × r × r or A = πr2
 
Pi is an irrational number, which means it goes on forever and can’t be con-
cretely written. You can’t express it as ratio. Supercomputers have worked 
out π to over 1 trillion digits, and that’s still not the end.
And now for a sample calculation. Drumroll, please! Figure 15-13 is a circle 
with one dimension, the radius.
 
Figure 15-13: 
A circle with 
a radius of 
four feet.
 
r = 4 feet

240
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Using Figure 15-13 and the area formula, you can now calculate the area.
A = π × 42
A = π × 16
A = 3.14159 × 16
A = 50.27 square feet
 
In the construction trades and in fashion design, you make measurements of 
circles and parts of circles from time to time. The example in Figure 15-13 is a 
little small for a patio and a little large for a tablecloth. But the idea is that you 
get the idea.
Perimeters: Along the Edges
Areas (see the preceding sections) aren’t the only shape measurements you 
may need in your work. In a number of careers, you need to know “how far 
around” an area is, which is a clumsy way of saying that you need to know 
how to calculate perimeters.
Figuring out perimeters is simple. The units may vary (for example, you 
use feet to measure the perimeter of a fencing job and miles to measure the 
perimeter of a state), but the principles are identical. Figuring perimeters 
isn’t very glamorous, and most people don’t think it’s exciting. It’s like kiss-
ing: When you’re young, at first it doesn’t seem like much fun, but later it’s 
more appealing. Can’t say the same for broccoli or Brussels sprouts. So if 
you’re ever given a choice between calculating perimeters and eating those 
vegetables, take the perimeters. The following sections give you the lowdown 
on finding the perimeters of basic shapes, including the square, rectangle, 
parallelogram, trapezoid, triangle, and circle.
Understanding perimeters: What goes 
around comes around
To be official about it, the perimeter is the outer limit of a region that’s 
bounded by line segments. Good, because every shape we discuss here is 
a region bounded by line segments. To put it another way, the perimeter is 
the path around an area. The word comes from the Greek, where peri means 
“around” and meter means “measure.”
Figure 15-14 illustrates a perimeter. In this case, the perimeter is the distance 
around all four sides of a rectangle.

241
 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
 
Figure 15-14: 
The parts 
of a rect-
angle’s 
perimeter.
 
 
If you’re landscaping, think bender board. If you’re pouring concrete, think 
forms. If you’re designing clothing, think rick rack. Even physical therapists 
and fitness trainers measure around waistlines, biceps, and thighs. Those are 
perimeters, too.
Calculating the perimeters of polygons
The bad news is that we can’t give you a universal “plug and chug” formula 
for all polygon perimeters. The good news is that we can give you several 
easy formulas for them.
The closest you can find to a general formula is the following:
P = s + s + s + s + s + s + . . .
All this formula is saying is that the perimeter (P) equals the sum of all the 
sides (s), just as you see in Figure 15-14. The ellipsis (. . .) in the formula 
means you keep on adding until you’ve got all the sides accounted for.
 
But instead of all that adding, follow these shortcut formulas:
 
✓ Square: Multiply one side by four.
 
✓ Rectangle: Multiply the length by two, multiply the width by two, and 
then add the products.
 
✓ Parallelogram: Multiply the length (long side) by two, multiply the short 
side by two, and then add the products.
 
✓ Trapezoid: Add all four sides.
 
✓ Triangle: Add all three sides.
 
✓ Regular polygon: For regular polygons (polygons with equal sides), mul-
tiply the length of one side by the total number of sides. For example, 
multiply one side of a regular pentagon by five to determine the shape’s 
perimeter.
 
✓ Irregular polygon: Add all the sides.

242
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
A perimeter by any other name: 
Finding a circle’s circumference
Circles are kind of like the black sheep of the perimeter family. A circle doesn’t 
have a perimeter — it has a circumference. The circumference, just like a perim-
eter, is the distance around the curved edge of a circle. The word comes from 
the Latin circumferentia, from circum (“around”) and ferre (“to carry”).
Use this great formula to find the circumference of a circle.
Circumference equals pi multiplied by the diameter
Circumference = π × diameter
C = π × d or C = π d
The variable d is the diameter of the circle, and π is pi (about 3.14159).
Figure 15-15 is an example of finding a circumference.
 
Figure 15-15: 
A circle and 
its diameter.
 
d = 6 feet

Plug the information from Figure 15-15 into the formula to find the 
 circumference.
C = π × d
C = π × 6
C = 18.85 feet
Volume: The Third Dimension
You can’t turn the knob down on these volumes, the volumes of rectangu-
lar solids and spheres. But you can find the volume, the amount of three- 
dimensional space a shape takes up.

243
 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
You express volume in cubic units (for example, cubic feet). In fact, volume is 
so important to so many vocations (especially science) that many fields have 
specialized units of volume. Cooking has many traditional volume measure-
ments, while the laboratory uses metric volume units. And the most common 
volumetric unit is in front of you every time your refuel your car. It’s called a 
gallon. Head to Chapter 6 for more on units of volume.
Getting a handle on American 
volume units
Volume measurement, conversion, and calculation are often essential to 
your professional life, so you need to be familiar with the terminology you 
encounter. The two main systems of measurement (for measuring volume 
and otherwise) are the American system and the metric system, which we 
cover in Chapter 6. American volume measurements get special treatment 
here because they’re a little more complex than the relatively straightfor-
ward metric volumes and require some explaining.
A standard U.S customary unit for measuring volume is the cubic inch (cu in 
or in3). A cubic inch is the volume of a cube with one inch on each side. 
Similarly, a cubic foot (cu ft or ft3) is the volume of a cube that has sides of 
one foot. A cubic yard (cu yd, CY, or yd3) is the volume of a cube that has 
sides of one yard. These units are used in only a couple of the trades.
Because a foot contains 12 inches, a cubic foot contains 12 × 12 × 12 cubic 
inches, or 1,728 in3.
The cubic inch used to be the standard unit for describing automobile engine 
capacity (sometimes called displacement). It’s been overtaken by metric units 
(the liter and the cc), but it’s still used when talking about American muscle 
cars. When The Beach Boys sang “409” in 1962, they were singing to the dream 
of American boys — owning a Chevrolet 409, a W-series V-8 engine. It had a dis-
placement of 409 cubic inches.
The U.S. liquid gallon (fl gal) is the main volume unit for liquids in the United 
States. You often buy apple juice, drinking water, and gasoline in gallons (or 
some subdivision of a gallon, like a quart or a pint). A cubic foot contains 
7.48051948 gallons; by law, the U.S. gallon is equal to 231 cubic inches.

244
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Calculating the volume of cuboids 
(also known as boxes)
The most-used volume calculation is for the cuboid, a solid figure bounded 
by six faces. That is, it’s a box. All its angles are right angles, and its opposite 
faces are equal. (A cube is a special case where all the faces are square.)
Figure 15-16 shows a cuboid.
 
Figure 15-16: 
A cuboid.
 
Length
Width
Height
The formula for calculating the volume of a cuboid is volume equals length 
times width times height. You write this equation as
Volume = Length × Width × Height
V = L × W × H
 
Although this formula is very straightforward, you live in an age of electronic 
automatic wonders and can find box volume calculators on the Internet.
 
If you’re a chef, you likely need to know the capacities of your reach-in refrig-
erators, usually measured in cubic feet. (Don’t rely on the manufacturer’s 
published capacity; manufacturers often count unusable space such as door 
water dispensers, hardware, and shelves in their calculations.) Figure 15-17 
illustrates an example of a reach-in refrigerator.

 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
You know the dimensions of the interior space. Plug them into your formula 
to get the volume of the refrigerator.
V = L × W × H
V = 2.5 × 2.5 × 4
V = 25 cubic feet
Finding the volumes of spheres 
and cylinders
A sphere is a round object; balls, globes, and the sun are all common spheres. 
As time passed and people stopped believing that the earth was flat, the 
earth became a well-known sphere as well. Figure 15-18 shows a sphere.
 
Figure 15-18: 
A sphere.
 
radius
The formula for figuring a sphere’s volume isn’t like the formula for a cuboid 
but rather more like the formula for the area of a circle (which you can find 
in “Computing the area of a circle” earlier in the chapter). The formula for 
calculating the volume of a sphere is volume equals four pi times the radius 
cubed divided by three; you write this calculation as
Note: Calculating the volume of a sphere isn’t super common in the trades, 
but you never know when it will pop up.
A related shape that comes up in automotive technology is the cylinder.
A cylinder is a curvilinear geometric shape. In plain talk, it looks like a can or 
a box of oats. Like the sphere, the cylinder is circle-based. See the cylinder in 
Figure 15-19.

Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
 
Figure 15-19:

Radius
Height
As you may have predicted, there’s a formula for calculating the volume of 
a cylinder. Its volume equals pi times the radius squared times the height, 
which you write as
Volume = π × radius squared × height
V = π × r2 × h or V = π × r × r × h or V = π r2h
Example: Bore and Stroke 
for the Auto Guy
 
You’re a well-trained auto mechanic. You have an excellent set of costly tools 
and are able to work with automobile diagnostic computers. But more impor-
tantly, you love cars. That’s why you’re ecstatic when one of your clients 
brings in an old Chevrolet Impala, a classic from the early 1960s, that he just 
bought. You identify the engine as a Chevy short block V-8, but your client 
wants to know its capacity so he can determine whether it’s a screamer or just 
a so-so engine.
To determine engine capacity, you measure the bore (diameter) and stroke 
(height) of the cylinders. This formula is a simple variation of the formula for 
calculating the volume of a cylinder. The differences are
 
✓ You can measure diameter (bore) but not the radius of a cylinder.
 
✓ You have eight cylinders. Fortunately (being an engine) all the cylinders 
are the same size.
Use this formula to calculate capacity:

247
 Chapter 15: Calculating Areas, Perimeters, and Volumes
The first part,
is just the area of a circle, where you divide the diameter (the bore) by 2 to 
get the radius and then square the radius and multiply by pi.
The second part, × stroke, asks you to multiply by the height of the engine 
cylinder, much like the formula for calculating the volume of a cylinder does. 
The last part, × number of cylinders, is very straightforward.
You measure a cylinder in the Chevy and find that it has the following 
 dimensions:
 
✓ Bore = 4.312 inches
 
✓ Stroke = 3.50 inches
Plug the information you have into the formula and calculate the capacity.
Capacity = 3.14159 × 4.6483 × 3.50 × 8
Capacity = 408.8855
The answer is 409 cubic inches. Your client’s car came with one of the classic 
high-capacity engines. They’re going to love him at the classic car show!
 
Although this formula isn’t hard to apply, you can also get the answer through 
an engine capacity calculator on the Internet.
Example: Yard Area, the Landscaper’s 
Nightmare
 
You’re a landscape contractor. The client wants a new lawn, and you need 
to calculate its area to estimate for seed or sod. The trouble is, the lawn area 
isn’t your regular garden-variety (har har) area. It has an irregular shape.

 It’s made up of a square, a rectangle, and part of a circle. It looks like 
half a circle, so you calculate the area of a full circle and divide by two.
 
2. Create a formula.
 
 You’re basically just adding the areas of the component shapes, so your 
formula looks something like the following:
 
 Total area = Area of square + area of rectangle +  area of circle
 
3. Determine the dimensions for the shapes.
 
• The dimensions for the square are given (20 feet × 20 feet).
 
• The dimensions for the rectangle are also given (20 feet × 40 feet).
 
• The dimension for the circle (the radius) is easy to see on inspection. 
The radius is the height of the square or the rectangle (20 feet).
 
4. Calculate the individual areas.
 
• Area of the square = 20 feet × 20 feet = 400 square feet
 
• Area of the rectangle = 20 feet × 40 feet = 800 square feet
 
• Area of the circle = 1/2 × π × 202 feet = 628.3 square feet
 
5. Add the areas together.
 
• Total area = 400 square feet + 800 square feet + 628.3 square feet
 
• Total area = 1,828.3 square feet
The answer is 1,828.3 square feet.

▶ Introducing the six common trigonometric functions
▶ Using trigonometry calculations to get real-world results
T
rigonometry is the branch of mathematics that studies triangles and 
their parts — angles and sides. The fact that a simple three-sided figure 
became the object of a big field of study may surprise you at first, but your 
surprise disappears as you discover the practical value of trigonometry.
We did an informal survey to find the “pain and anguish” factors in math. 
You can be sure that trigonometry was high on the P&A list. It was also a 
big winner on the F&L (fear and loathing) list. It’s one of the four great chill-
ers in math (the others being algebra, geometry, and calculus — check out 
Chapters 12 and 14 for more on the first two), those classes that spark kids 
to stop paying attention.
Trigonometry (or trig, as you can freely call it) seems mysterious, but it’s one 
of the most useful studies you get into. It’s practical as well as conceptual, 
and it answers important questions in a fast and easy way. Plus, it’s valuable 
in several professions, especially surveying, land engineering, architecture, 
and marine navigation.
In this chapter you see the basic ideas behind trigonometry. You also identify 
six functions and use them to do a little trig math.
Handling Triangles: More Angles 
than a Cornfield Maze
Trigonometry is the study of triangles, their angles, and their sides. It’s espe-
cially about right triangles, but you extend it to apply to all triangles.

250
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Look at what you probably already know about triangles (see Chapter 14 for 
more):
 
✓ A triangle has three sides.
 
✓ A triangle has three angles.
 
✓ The three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So if you know 
two angles, you get the third angle by subtracting those two figures 
from 180 degrees.
 
✓ With the Pythagorean theorem, you can find the length of one side of a 
right triangle when you know the length of the other two sides.
You’re well on your way to handling triangles. But what about the rest? What 
happens when you know two angles and one side? Two sides and one angle? 
Can that get you anything? Yes it can, when you use trigonometry.
When you know three of a triangle’s six parts (three sides and three angles), 
you can get all six parts, provided one of the given parts is the length of a 
side. That piece of magic is called solving the triangle, and it’s brought to you 
by Trigonometrus the Magician, now appearing in this chapter.
And how does Trigonometrus pull a triangle out of his hat? Through an 
understanding of the relationships (or you can say ratios) between the sides. 
We discuss these relationships in the following section.
 
Here’s 20 seconds of history. Before the Greeks, the Egyptians and Babylonians 
knew the ratios of the sides of a triangle, but they didn’t know angles. (The 
Egyptians used a primitive slope measurement, the seked, to build the pyra-
mids.) Indian trig concepts didn’t get to medieval Islamic scholars until about 
the 10th century. Europe got on board in the 15th and 16th centuries. But they 
didn’t “get it” until Nicolaus Copernicus (who proposed that the sun was the 
center of the solar system) wrote about it in Book II of his “De revolutionibus 
orbium coelestium” or “On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres.”
Did you study for the Triangle Measure test?
The word trigonometry comes from the Greek 
words trig∂non, meaning “triangle,” and 
metron, meaning “measure.” If you’re speak-
ing ancient Greek, this wording makes great 
sense. The problem for English speakers is that 
educators never translated the words into plain 
English. If they had, you’d now have a course 
called “Triangle Measure 101,” which may 
cause less panic.

251
 Chapter 16: Trigonometry, the “Mystery Math”
By Their Sines Shall Ye Know Them: 
Using Trigonometric Functions
Six trig functions describe the relationships between the sides of a triangle. 
Three are very important, and the other three are on the B team because 
they’re reciprocal functions, defined as the reciprocals of the main functions.
The functions have long names and short abbreviations used in calculations. 
They are
Function
Abbreviation
Sine
sin
Cosine
cos
Tangent
tan
Reciprocal function
Abbreviation
Cosecant
csc
Secant
sec
Cotangent
cot
Now you know the names, but what do they mean? Figure 16-1 shows a trian-
gle from which you can derive the functions. It’s a right triangle, signified by 
the little square in angle C. It has angles A, B, and C. The sides are a, b, and c.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Angles and 
sides of a 
triangle.

Opposite side
Angle A faces the side called the opposite side. It’s next to the side called the 
adjacent side. The remaining side is the hypotenuse, which is always the lon-
gest side in a right triangle.

252
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
Examine the relationship between any two sides. The following sections dis-
cuss the three great relationships (ratios) and the three so-so relationships 
you get in any triangle.
Sine, cosine, and tangent: 
Three great relationships
The sine (abbreviated sin) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
The cosine (abbreviated cos) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
The tangent (abbreviated tan) is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent 
side.
At some point, as you see the value of knowing trig functions, you want an 
easy way to remember them. Try this mnemonic device:
 
1. Start with what you know:
 
• Sine = Opposite ÷ Hypotenuse
 
• Cosine = Adjacent ÷ Hypotenuse
 
• Tangent = Opposite ÷ Adjacent
 
2. Remember the first letter of each part of the formulas and combine 
them into a phrase.
 
 We like “Some Officers Have Curly Auburn Hair Till Old Age,” but any-
thing that works for you is fine. The letters SOH, CAH, and TOA each 
give you a key to the formula.
 
As a practical matter, you use other methods besides manual calculation to 
get an angle’s trig values. You can also use trigonometry tables and calcula-
tors from the Internet, a scientific calculator, or the trig functions in a spread-
sheet program.

253
 Chapter 16: Trigonometry, the “Mystery Math”
Cosecant, secant, and cotangent: 
Three so-so relationships
The three less-common trig functions (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) are 
reciprocal functions. They’re the three basic functions (see the preceding sec-
tion) with the ratios inverted.
The cosecant (abbreviated csc) is a variation of the sine function. It’s the ratio 
of the hypotenuse to the opposite side.
The secant (abbreviated sec) is a variation of the cosine function. It’s the ratio 
of the hypotenuse to the adjacent side.
The cotangent (abbreviated cot) is a variation of the tangent function, but with 
the terms inverted. It’s the ratio of the adjacent side to the opposite side.
 
These function names are terrible, aren’t they? Through the miracle of chan-
neling, the ancient mathematicians want to apologize to you. Aryabhata dis-
covered the sine and cosine. Muhammad ibn MΔs≈ al-Khw≈rizm∫ discovered 
the tangent. AbΔ al-Waf≈’ BΔzj≈n∫ discovered the secant, cotangent, and cose-
cant. But the biggest apology comes from Albert Girard (1595–1632) because 
he was the first to use the abbreviations sin, cos, and tan in a paper. If he had 
called the functions “burger,” “fries,” and “shake,” trig would be a lot more 
understandable today.
The law of sines
The law of sines shows Trigonometrus the Magician at his best. It states that
This law applies to any triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C, 
where A is the angle opposite side a, B is the angle opposite side b, and C is 
the angle opposite side c.

254
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
The value of the law of sines is that when you know three measurements of 
a triangle (as long as they include at least one side), you solve for the fourth 
measurement with no problem. You must have two angles and a side or two 
sides and an angle.
Example: Surveying a River
 
You’re at the Monongahela River in the Monongahela, Pennsylvania. How wide 
is the river? The only tools you have to for figuring the answer are your trusty 
surveying transit, a pad, and a calculator. Well, to make it a little easier, you 
also have a laptop with Wi-Fi and a spreadsheet program.
 
You identify trig problems by seeing whether you can construct a triangle. 
If you have enough information, you can solve for the answer. Your best trig 
friend is the law of sines (which we cover in the preceding section).
Use trigonometry. Establish a triangle, and then measure two angles and one 
distance (side). Figure 16-2 shows the setup. This triangle is a right triangle, 
as the little square in angle C shows. It has angles A, B, and C, and the sides 
are a, b, and c.

Establish a 
triangle to

the river’s

1. Starting at Old Town, sight Fort Defiance (which is also angle B) 
directly across the river from Old Town (which is also angle C) and 
then walk 500 feet north (at exactly 90 degrees) to A.

255
 Chapter 16: Trigonometry, the “Mystery Math”
 
2. Take a sighting of Fort Defiance from your new vantage point, A.
 
 Angle A is 31 degrees.
 
3. Use the angles you know to calculate the third angle.
 
 Because the three angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees, and you 
know angles A (which you measured in Step 2) and C (which you estab-
lished as a right angle), do the following subtraction to get angle B.
 
 180 degrees – 90 degrees – 31 degrees = 59 degrees
 
 Angle B is 59 degrees.
 
4. Use a calculator or a spreadsheet program to find the sines of angles A 
and B.
 
 That works out to
 
 sin A = 0.5150 
sin B = 0.8572
 
5. Use the law of sines to find a, the distance across the river.
 
 Use the terms that include a and b.
 
 Substitute the values you know.
 
6. Use algebra to make the equation a little friendlier by multiplying 
both sides by 0.5150.
 
 Your equation looks like the following:
 
 The answer is 300.4317 feet.
Example: Locating a Wildfire
 
You’re a U.S. Forest Service fire lookout on Bald Mountain, a couple of miles 
outside of Sterling City in Butte County, California. Like all Californians and 
forestry professionals, you take the threat of wildfire very seriously.
You see a plume of smoke and take a bearing, which shows the fire is 40 degrees 
east of north from your station. Bill Love, another lookout, is due east 20 miles 
away and sees the same plume; his bearing is 15 degrees east of north. You 
exchange information by phone. How far away is the fire from your tower?

256
Part III: Basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry 
As with the example in Figure 16-2 earlier in the chapter, establish a triangle 
and then measure two angles and one distance. Figure 16-3 shows the setup. 
This triangle is an obtuse triangle. It has angles A, B, and C. The sides are a, 
b, and c, but you’re only interested in side b, the distance from your tower to 
the fire.
 
Figure 16-3: 
Set up a 
triangle to 
figure the 
distance to 
the wildfire.
 
Your tower

1. Determine angle A by subtracting your 40-degree bearing from 
90 degrees.
 
 You use this method because your bearing was based on due north and 
the other tower is due east, creating a 90-degree angle. Your bearing and 
angle A total 90 degrees, so angle A is 50 degrees.
 
2. Determine angle B by adding Bill’s 15-degree bearing to 90 degrees.
 
 You use this method because his bearing was based on due north and 
the east-west line between your two towers. That’s a 90-degree angle. 
His bearing of 15 degrees plus the 90-degree angle total 105 degrees.
 
 Angle B is 105 degrees.
 
3. Subtract to find angle C.
 
 Because the three angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees, and you 
know angles A and B, do the following subtraction to get angle C.
 
 180 degrees – 50 degrees – 105 degrees = 25 degrees
 
 Angle C is 25 degrees.
 
4. Use a calculator or a spreadsheet program to find the sines of angles A 
and B.
 
 The calculation works out to
 
sin B = 0.26237 sin C = 0.13235

257
 Chapter 16: Trigonometry, the “Mystery Math”
 
5. Use the law of sines to find b, the distance to the fire from your tower.
 
 Use the terms that include b and c.
 
 Substitute the values you know.
 
6. Use algebra to make the equation a little friendlier by multiplying 
both sides by 0.26237.
 
 You end up with
 
 The answer is 39.6479 miles.
This example is something of a classic and appears in various forms in vari-
ous publications. The calculation is a fundamental one for the U.S. Forest 
Service and any agency where lookout towers are used.
Knowledge is power, except when it’s not
If you’re too clever (and maybe if you use 
too much trig), your creativity may get you in 
trouble on the job and in school. Jogger James 
Fixx (who helped start America’s fitness revolu-
tion and wrote Games for the Superintelligent 
[Galahad Books]) gave this example in a 
Playboy Magazine interview:
Say someone gives you a barometer and asks 
you to use it to determine the height of a build-
ing. The person is probably expecting you to 
use an old formula about the difference in baro-
metric pressure between ground level and the 
building’s peak. Big yawn. Instead, you solve 
the problem in one of three different ways.
 ✓ You go to the top of the building and drop 
the barometer off. By timing its descent to 
the ground and knowing the formula for 
acceleration under gravity, you determine 
how high the building is. That’s algebra.
 ✓ You stick the barometer in the ground at 
the point of the building’s shadow, and by 
using the ratio of the barometer’s shadow 
to the barometer’s height and the build-
ing’s shadow to the building’s height, you 
calculate the height of the building. That’s 
geometry.
 ✓ You go to the manager of the building and 
say, “Mr. Superintendent, I will give you 
this very fine barometer if you tell me how 
tall your building is.” That’s bargaining.
Such unorthodox thinking is bound to get you 
a head slap!

Math for the

Your Work

In this part . . .
P
eople say that life is what happens to you while 
you’re making other plans. That saying has a rough 
equivalent in work: “Your real job is never the same as 
the job described in the job description.” New and unex-
pected experiences always cause change.
Part IV prepares you for three of the unscheduled, not-on-
the-menu tasks of modern technical work. For example, 
you may be a great carpenter and a whiz at residential and 
commercial construction, but as you rise in the company, 
you may find yourself required to make presentations to 
clients. That’s where the charts and graphs in Chapter 17 
come in. Or perhaps you were hired to cut 2 x 4s, but now 
you’re a supervisor who needs to check employee time 
cards and bill labor to clients. Never fear: Chapter 18’s 
discussions of time math are here to help. And heaven 
help you if you have to buy the computers for the front 
office! Heaven may help eventually, but in the meantime, 
take a look at Chapter 19. It describes computer capaci-
ties and speeds.

In This Chapter
▶ Getting the most value out of graphs and charts
▶ Discovering the most important chart types
▶ Deciphering charts and graphs (and evaluating their quality)
▶ Creating great graphs
You’ve probably heard of graphic novels — stories told in pictures. 
Many people love them because pictures communicate so much 
(they’re worth 1,000 words, after all).
Even if graphic novels aren’t your thing, you’ve certainly heard of and used 
charts — if you’ve ever used a road map (a visual representation of geogra-
phy and distance), you’ve used a kind of chart.
Graphs and charts are the mathematical equivalents of these everyday items. 
They may not be as exciting as manga (the picture stories so popular in 
Japan), but mathematical charts and graphs easily explain information and 
concepts and help you effectively communicate ideas to other people.
In this chapter, you discover the types of graphs and their parts and become 
an expert in reading and making them.
Defining Charts and Graphs 
and Their Advantages
In practical math, a graph and a chart are the same thing. They both refer 
to a graphic that shows tabular data in a visual form, otherwise known as 
an information graphic. You can pretty much use the words chart and graph 
interchangeably.

262
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
Figure 17-1 shows some typical types of charts and graphs. Don’t worry yet 
about what the types are.

If you want to get formal about definitions, one source says that “In mathemat-
ics, a graph is an abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs 
of the objects are connected by links.”
Here are some advantages of using and making charts and graphs:
 
✓ You can understand the numbers in charts more quickly and easily 
because a chart is a visual (not textual) presentation. Trying to interpret 
a column or table of numbers may make your eyes roll up into your 
head, but a good chart or graph does some of the interpreting for you, 
making the information easier to get. Similarly, when you make charts 
and graphs, you communicate information better.
 
✓ You can easily understand large quantities of data and see the relation-
ships among different items.
The advantages apply to most trades, especially the business side of any 
trade. You can use charts to compare the properties of materials, the cost of 
materials, or the rate you’re using materials up.
 
One chart disadvantage: Charts can be less precise than tables or listed infor-
mation. Charts and graphs provide easy-to-read visuals, but they can’t always 
concretely portray the more minute specifics of data.
Paying Tables Their Proper Respect
Tabular data is information that appears in a table of rows and columns. 
Although we champion charts and graphs over tables in the preceding sec-
tion, we can’t dis tabular information entirely — it’s the basis for graphs. (If 
you build charts in Microsoft Excel, you start with rows and columns: tabular 
data.) Tables may be a little hard to figure out, but they’re the form that spec-
ifications come in, including the materials you work with every day, so you 
have to know how to deal with them. And no matter what, a table on its worst 
day is better than the same text inline (written out) on its best day.

263
 Chapter 17: Graphs Are Novel and Charts Are Off the Chart
 
For those working in cooking or pastry, a recipe is a table of data. Welders 
compare welding rods by using tables, and machinists use tables when they 
look up feed rates. And lots of folks buy computers for business or home by 
reading endless tables of specifications. Some online vendors build the tables 
for you with a “compare side by side” feature.
For example, compare the following text describing quantities of laboratory 
reagents with the same information shown in table form in Table 17-1:
“We have on hand 2.5 kilograms of sodium hydroxide, 2.5 liters of sulfuric 
acid, 500 milliliters of nitric acid, and 500 milliliters of glacial acetic acid.”
Now look at Table 17-1.
Table 17-1 
Inventory of Reagents in Storeroom
Reagent
Quantity
Sodium Hydroxide
2.5 kg
Sulfuric Acid
2.5 l
Nitric Acid
500 ml
Acetic Acid, Glacial
500 ml
The table is orderly and somewhat visual, which makes finding information in 
the table easier than in the inline text.
Introducing the Three Most 
Important Types of Charts
A chart can take many forms because certain types of charts show informa-
tion better than other types. The three most important types of charts (the 
ones you encounter most often in your work) are line graphs, bar graphs, 
and pie charts. These are the charts you’re most likely to construct when you 
want to communicate with other people, so they’re the ones we discuss in 
the following sections.
 
In precise mathematical terms, there are a bazillion types of charts. Some are 
variants of the three types in this chapter. A few examples include area charts, 
scatter charts, open-high-low-close charts, cartograms, timeline charts, pedi-
gree charts, bubble charts, Gantt charts, PERT charts, Pareto charts, organiza-
tion charts, and flowcharts.

Walking the line graph
A line graph contains lines made up of connected data points. The graph often 
shows changes in a quantity or the value of something over time. Figure 17-2 
is a typical line graph.

Savings
The graph shows a trend in income and savings over a period of time (2001 
to 2009). From this graph, you quickly see trends. For example, income rises 
over the first seven years and then starts to decline in the last two (as the 
hard times hit). Savings start to grow but peak in about 2004 — and have 
declined ever since.
Sidling up to the bar graph
A bar graph isn’t a map to the local bars. A bar graph or bar chart uses bars 
(either horizontal or vertical) of various lengths to show values. Most bar 
graphs show information for only one item per bar.
Figure 17-3 shows a vertical bar graph.
 
The numbers in Figure 17-3 are real percentages based on a U.S. News & World 
Report article written by Deborah Kotz for the March 28, 2008, issue.

A histogram is a special kind of bar chart. It uses bars to show groups or 
bands of data, such as the average height of students in various age groups 
or the percentage of various age groups in a city’s population, as bars.

266
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
The technique for calculating the values is called binning because the data 
are put into groups or bins. Figure 17-5 is a histogram.

Histograms are very useful, but read (and create) them carefully. They’re 
prone to distortion if the creator calculates the average values poorly or if the 
value ranges of the bins aren’t equal. In Figure 18-5, for example, only two of 
the middle bins have equal ranges. Similarly, the bins for the Nielsen TV rat-
ings age demographics are all over the place because advertisers want to sell 
to some very specific (and not equal) age bands.
Getting a piece of the pie chart
As you can see in the preceding sections, a line graph is a fine graph, and a 
bar chart is a good start. However, you may find that you want to make the 
pie chart “my chart.” Seriously, the pie chart is probably the most widely-used 
chart.
The pie chart or pie graph represents information as a circle divided into sec-
tors or slices. The different-sized sectors show the relationship among the 
items of information. The pie chart is a super type of graph when you want to 
show how parts of something add up to 100 percent of a whole thing.

267
 Chapter 17: Graphs Are Novel and Charts Are Off the Chart
 
The earliest known pie chart is credited to William Playfair’s Statistical 
Breviary of 1801. And who, pray tell, is William Playfair? For one thing, he’s a 
guy with such a great name that you shouldn’t finish this book without know-
ing it. He was also a Scottish engineer and economist credited with pioneering 
statistic graphics and inventing the line graph and bar chart of economic data, 
as well as the pie chart and circle graph.
Figure 17-6 illustrates two pie charts. The first one is a regular chart, and the 
second one is exploded to emphasize a particular wedge.

Reading Charts and Graphs (And 
Recognizing a Bad One)
You do two things to get the most out of a chart. First, you recognize its 
parts, and second, you draw meaningful conclusions from the information 
presented. A good chart pays you back by communicating a lot of good 
information. Unfortunately, not all charts are good charts; some charts may 
be incomplete or distorted. The following sections show you how to identify 
good charts as well as the parts that make them up.

268
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
For a start, the parts of a chart
The first step in reading a chart is to figure out which standard chart parts it 
does and doesn’t have. Here’s a short list of the parts you can expect on most 
charts. Not all charts have all parts, but all charts have at least some of them.
 
✓ Title: A chart’s title is usually at the top or bottom of the chart. It tells 
you what the chart is about.
 
✓ Axis: A line graph or bar graph has two axes — a horizontal axis and a 
vertical axis — that cross at a point called the origin. Each point in the 
graph is some distance to the left or right of the vertical axis and above 
or below the horizontal axis. Note: In many graphs, the plot area (see 
the later bullet) shows only one region of the axes. For example, the 
charts in this chapter show only the area to the right of the vertical axis 
and above the horizontal axis.
 
✓ Scales: The chart’s scale typically shows the units the information is pre-
sented in. The units may be time, numbers, percentages, and so on. The 
horizontal and vertical axes each have a scale, and each should have 
some sort of periodic graduations.
 
 Expect each scale to have a label. A scale with units (for example, 50, 
150, 200, 250, and 300) isn’t very useful if it doesn’t tell you what they 
represent. With these sample numbers, a label such as “Miles Driven 
Each Week” is a necessary description.
 
 Even in a pie chart, expect to find units clearly described.
 
✓ Plot area or data area: This area is where the information appears. 
Basically, it’s the area that isn’t the title, axis, scales, or labels.
 
✓ Grid: Some charts have a grid, a series of vertical or horizontal lines that 
help you easily see and compare the values. Expect to see grid lines on a 
line graph or a bar graph but not on a pie chart.
 
✓ Data: The information in a graph can be dots, lines, bars, pie wedges, and 
symbols. These are data points. Truly, you can plot the data any number 
of ways as long as the method communicates the information well.
 
 Sometimes you see more than one variable on a line graph or a bar graph. 
This setup allows you to compare multiple quantities at the same time.
 
✓ Symbols: A symbol is a picture used to show the amount of an item. It 
makes a more interesting chart, but be sure to label what the symbol 
represents and the value of each symbol. Figure 17-7 is an example of a 
chart that uses symbols.

269
 Chapter 17: Graphs Are Novel and Charts Are Off the Chart
 
✓ Legend: The chart may include a legend, a list of the variables in the 
chart that describes what each color or pattern of the lines or bars in 
the graph represents. For example, weight and height may appear on a 
line graph showing a child’s growth over time. Each line may be a sepa-
rate color or be solid or dashed so you can tell them apart. In a pie graph, 
the legend describes what the color or pattern of each slice represents.

The good, the bad, the ugly, 
and the inaccurate
Edward Rolf Tufte (pronounced tuf-tee) is famous in the world of visual 
design as the supreme authority on visual communication of information. If 
you see a good, professionally constructed graph (for example, online in a 
major newspaper), the designer was probably influenced by Tufte. If you see 
a bad graph (and there are quite a few), there’s no telling what the designer 
was under the influence of.
Tufte invented the term chartjunk to describe the stuff on graphs that’s use-
less or obscures the meaning. Based on his books and common sense, we 
present four categories of charts: good, bad, ugly, and inaccurate.
 
✓ Good graphs: A good graph presents good data in the best format. It has 
every needed element, but only those elements it truly needs, making it 
complete and accurate. A good graph isn’t confusing in any respect.

270
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
 
✓ Bad graphs: A bad graph is pretty much the opposite of a good one. A 
bad graph may present the information in the wrong format (for exam-
ple, pie chart instead line graph) or have missing elements (such as 
units) or poorly chosen units. Omitted or incomplete information makes 
a bad graph even worse.
 
✓ Ugly graphs: An ugly graph has too much of everything. It may be accu-
rate, but nobody cares because nobody can read it. Ugly graphs are the 
ones with too much information, too many labels, too many variables, or 
too many colors. In addition, the type size may be too small, and all the 
data may be too crowded.
 
✓ Inaccurate graphs: The worst graphs are those whose representations 
(especially bars and symbols) make the variables look bigger or smaller 
than they are. Another contributor is out-and-out wrong data. Such 
graphs are inherently inaccurate or present information in a distorted, 
inaccurate way. Omitting data can also make a chart inaccurate.
 
The worst inaccuracies kill people. When NASA was debating whether to 
launch the space shuttle Challenger, the managers were presented with badly 
prepared charts from the manufacturer of the shuttle’s solid rocket-fuel boost-
ers. The charts left out information, presented information badly, included 
unimportant information, and failed to put related pieces of information on the 
same chart. NASA decided to launch, the O-rings failed, and the crew perished.
Making Charts and Graphs
Graphs are great communication tools if you know how to make them prop-
erly. When you make your own charts and graphs, you become a graphic 
designer as well as a practical mathematician. The basic “good graph” rules 
from the preceding section apply to graphs you construct yourself:
 
✓ Use the proper type of chart for the information you’re presenting. 
The wrong kind of chart can’t communicate your information as clearly 
the right chart can.
 
✓ Use only essential data. Avoid putting useless information in your work. 
Excess information confuses the reader, makes reading harder, and 
shortens the reader’s attention span.
 
✓ Use accurate data.
 
✓ Use good, clear, and meaningful titles, legends, and labels. That 
includes good fonts in sizes that aren’t too big or too small. Make sure 
your title clearly and accurately represents the chart’s content.

271
 Chapter 17: Graphs Are Novel and Charts Are Off the Chart
 
✓ Use appropriate units. Measuring in inches when feet are more intui-
tive makes your chart harder to understand. Also, avoid mixing U.S.  
American units with metric units.
 
✓ Use a plain white background that allows the important information 
to stand out. Decorative or fancy backgrounds may make your graph 
harder to read.
 
If you use Microsoft Excel, try the chart wizards. The software is far from 
perfect, but it can handle of lot of the tedious tasks in chart-making. Just be 
cautious (what you get out is only as good as what you put in), and don’t get 
fancy; you may end up with a chart that’s too cutesy.
The following sections give you instructions for creating solid, useful line, 
bar, and pie graphs.
Creating line graphs
The following is a simple procedure for making a good line graph:
 
1. Gather all your information first.
 
 Keep everything neat and orderly.
 
2. If you’re making a line graph by hand, use graph paper (the paper 
with vertical and horizontal lines).
 
 If graph paper isn’t available, a piece of plain paper works fine.
 
3. Make your graph large.
 
 Use the paper to its fullest. It helps prevent cramming information into 
tight spots.
 
4. Draw scales for both the vertical and horizontal axes and add in the 
marks for units.
 
5. Label both axes.
 
 Always name the units and what information they represent. For exam-
ple, you may write “Fuel Consumption (gallons).”
 
6. Plot your points and connect them with a line.
 
 Use dots, small circles, small diamonds, or small triangles. You can use 
other symbols, but don’t get too cute.
 
7. Add a clear title.
 
8. If you have multiple variables, add a legend.

272
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
Building bar graphs
Like line graphs (see the preceding section), you use a simple procedure for 
making a good bar graph.
 
1. Gather your information.
 
2. Use graph paper.
 
3. Make your graph large.
 
4. Draw a scale for both the vertical and horizontal axes and add in the 
marks for units.
 
5. Label both axes.
 
 Remember to include both the units and what they represent.
 
6. Draw the bars.
 
7. Add a title.
 
8. If you have multiple variables, add a legend.
Putting together pie charts
In many ways, making a pie chart is very similar to making line and bar 
graphs (see the preceding sections). One difference: You don’t need to worry 
about graph paper — plain paper is fine. Follow this procedure:
 
1. Gather your information.
 
2. Use a compass to draw the circle and a protractor to draw slices that 
are about the right size.
 
 Remember to make your graph large. If you have a slice that represents 
15 percent, you don’t necessarily have to measure out precisely 15 per-
cent of the circle; just be sure it doesn’t obviously look like 25 percent.
 
 When you have too many categories to make a readable pie chart, con-
sider combining the items. For example, in a housing-costs scenario, you 
can combine plumbing fixtures with plumbing connection work. You 
lose precision, but remember, a graph isn’t a precision instrument. It’s 
supposed to provide a picture.
 
3. Use color to clearly differentiate your slices.
 
 Pie charts are one instance where color is a really constructive element in 
a chart. Using colors in a pie chart makes separating each category much 

273
 Chapter 17: Graphs Are Novel and Charts Are Off the Chart
easier. In a pie chart, you’re always trying to separate the data as much as 
compare it.
 
4. Add a title.
 
If you’re using two pie charts side by side with the same categories of data, be 
consistent. For example, if you have pie charts to show budgets for two busi-
ness operations, use the same size pies, the same data elements, the same 
labels, and the same colors for the corresponding data elements. Yes, the 
sizes of the slices are different in each graph, but the colors help the reader’s 
eyes distinguish and compare them.
Some people will tell you that pie charts aren’t good for comparing two sets 
of data, and they’re frequently right. If you find yourself using two pie charts 
side by side, be careful. It doesn’t automatically mean you’ve made bad 
choice, but you’ve got to be certain the presentation best conveys what you 
want to say. 
 
Additionally, pie charts are susceptible to a couple of unique traps. Pie chart 
errors include
 
✓ Having too many slices: Excessive slices are a prime cause of confusing 
pie graphs. They indicate that you probably picked the wrong type of 
graph for the information presented. Consider using a bar graph instead.
 
✓ Failure to label the slices correctly: If you’re trying to tell your reader 
that the food bill for your kitchen operation is 25 percent of your total 
budget and your label points to the 10 percent allocated for electricity, 
you’ve got an inaccurate chart.
 
Try the Microsoft Excel chart wizards. Be careful if you choose a 3-D pie 
chart — sometimes this type of presentation distorts the data by making 
some pieces look a little larger than they really are.
Example: Tracking Weight and 
Height in a Pediatric Practice
 
You work in a pediatric practice and regularly measure the height and weight 
of your young patients. When they were babies, you measured their length. 
(My, they grow up so fast!)

274
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
Young John Doe is now 15. The doctor tells you his height is about right for 
a boy his age, but he’s looking a little porky. She asks you to prepare a graph 
showing John’s height and weight over his childhood years. She gives you 
the information in the form of Table 17-2.
Table 17-2

Create the chart:
 
1. Select the best chart type.
 
 A line chart is excellent for showing change over time. You use one line 
for weight and another for height
 
2. Gather the information.
 
 This one’s easy: The doctor gave you the info in the table.
 
3. Draw a scale for the horizontal axis, which shows John’s ages.
 
4. Draw a scale for the vertical axis.
 
 The vertical axis can show both height in inches and weight in pounds. 
Your legend (Step 6) explains what the data points mean.
 
5. Plot your points (use dots, small circles, small diamonds, or small tri-
angles) and connect them with a line.
 
6. Because you have multiple variables, add a legend.
 
 Use “Height (inches)” and “Weight (pounds),” which clearly describe 
your info.
 
7. Add a clear title.
 
 “John Doe Height and Weight” clearly indicates what your chart presents.
Your line graph should look something like Figure 17-8.

275
 Chapter 17: Graphs Are Novel and Charts Are Off the Chart
Comparison with published averages shows that John’s increases in height 
and weight are entirely average. If John is looking like a little doughboy, he’s 
probably spending too much time in front of the television. Prescription:

Example: Cost of Materials in 
Residential Construction
 
You’re rising fast in a residential real estate development company. For better 
or worse, your job now requires a lot more than swinging a hammer. Your 
boss has asked you to create a pie chart that provides a good visual that 
shows what goes into building a residence.
The good news is that your company’s typical house is 1,600 square feet with 
an attached garage. It’s a six-cornered (L-shaped) design. Further, it has no 
fireplace, woodstove, or attic, which keeps costs down. The bad news is that 
your company builds in the Sacramento suburbs in Northern California. Even 
a modest house costs a lot to build there.
You use an Internet calculator to get the costs for 28 separate cost catego-
ries, with a total cost of $220,769. (People in other parts of the country may 
now recover from fainting and continue reading.)

276
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
As a simple example, use the six costliest categories for your pie chart (after 
clearing it with your boss, of course). These categories reflect about half the 
cost of building a house and are shown in Table 17-3.

Create your chart:
 
1. Select the chart type.
 
 In this case, it has to be a pie chart, because that’s what your boss asked 
you to prepare. But it’s also the best way to show the parts of a whole.
 
2. Gather the information.
 
 This information’s in the table. However, you judge that these tasks are 
better expressed as percentages, so convert the total cost for a task into 
a percentage (total cost for a task, divided by total cost for the house, 
multiplied by 100).
 
3. Use a compass to create the circle.
 
4. Draw the wedges with a protractor.
 
5. Add a legend or label individual slices of the pie.
 
6. Add a clear title, such as “Cost of Building a House.”
 
Keep in mind that this example gives the details on only 6 of the 28 categories. 
To keep the chart simple, you combine the remaining 22 categories into an 
“All Other Costs” category.

Chapter 18
Hold on a Second: Time Math
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing time units
▶ Identifying different methods of noting time
▶ Converting time in traditional, fractional, and decimal form
▶ Performing basic time addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
T
ime is an essential and undeniable part of the human experience. That’s 
a lofty statement in a book about technical mathematics. But it’s true — 
reckoning time is a vital component of almost every civilization.
Time is easy to read, report, measure, and calculate. In this chapter, you see 
how to denote time in both common and uncommon ways. You convert time 
into traditional, fractional, and decimal forms and perform some time math.
 
Many societies are run by time: They’re deadline-driven and have a very low 
tolerance for tardiness. But at least one place has no concept of time. The 
Pirahã people on the Mai ci river in the Amazon rainforest speak by humming 
and whistling; they have no more than eight consonants and three vowels and 
have no numbers and no time.
Dividing Time into Hours, 
Minutes, and Seconds
Time is the most precisely measured quantity on earth. Atomic clocks are 
accurate to 10−9 seconds (one billionth of a second) per day, and accurate 
time is essential for maintaining the frequency of television broadcasts and 
operating the GPS system.

280
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
Time is important in both business and personal activity in the following ways:
 
✓ Time is a measure of progress or capacity. For example, you say “How 
much did you get done on the project today?” or “How many blood sam-
ples can you analyze in an hour?”
 
✓ Time marks the point at which something will happen. For example, 
you say “When does the store open?” or “When does your flight leave?” 
(You may not believe it, but commercial airplanes are supposed to take 
off and land “on time.”)
 
✓ Time is the basis for good manners and cooperation. You’re expected 
to arrive at work on time. Also, being “fashionably late” to meet a friend 
is a sign of discourtesy.
If your career requires delivering anything, cooking food, curing concrete, 
centrifuging in the lab, meeting people or banking, time is a factor. If you bill 
clients for time expended, or if you’re paid by the hour, time is the key to 
business and personal income. Many activities in business and in personal 
life run “on the clock.”
To make time easier to quantify, it’s divided into units: hours, minutes, and 
seconds.
A day is made up of 24 hours. An hour contains 60 minutes, and a minute 
contains 60 seconds. Another way to think of it is to say a second is 1/60 of a 
minute, a minute is 1/60 of an hour, and an hour is 1/24 of a day.
Timekeeping is the act of determining the time. You call it telling time. Tell 
means count, which is why the person at your bank is called a teller. Duration 
or elapsed time is the amount of time that passes between two events. For 
example, a race has a start time and an end time. The amount of time it takes 
the winner to cross the finish line is the duration.
 
Ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Babylon, Sumer, the Indus Valley civili-
zation, and China, divided the daylight time into 12 parts. One source credits 
the Egyptians for dividing the night into 12 parts.
Here’s a reminder about some things you already know (and if you didn’t 
know these things, keep quiet):
 
✓ Larger units of time are the day, week, month, year, decade (10 years) 
century (100 years), and millennium (1,000 years).
 
✓ Smaller units of time are the tenth of a second (0.1 seconds), the hun-
dredth of a second (0.01 seconds), the millisecond (0.001 seconds), 
the microsecond (a millionth of a second or 0.000001 seconds) and the 
nanosecond (a billionth of a second, or 0.000000001 seconds).

281
 Chapter 18: Hold on a Second: Time Math
Not everyone uses the same conventions, styles, and standards for writing 
and speaking the time and the date. For example:
 
✓ In most countries, you write the last day of 2014 as 2014-12-31. The last 
second of the year is 23:59:59.
 
✓ In the United States, you use America’s traditional notation — you write 
that date as 12/31/2014 and that time as 12:59:59 p.m.
There’s a Time for Us, Somewhere a Time 
for Us: Time Notation Systems
Methods of showing and saying the time have varied over thousands of 
years. Today, two methods are most prominent; we cover these two meth-
ods, and a few more that are commonly used in some circumstances, in the 
following sections.
What is time, exactly?
So what is time? Everyone knows that it exists, 
but it seems that no one can define it precisely.
 ✓ For science and everyday life, time is a 
system for measuring the occurrence of 
events and the duration between events. 
The definition is circular: Time is a system 
for measuring time.
 ✓ Religion, philosophy, and science all study 
time but have disagreements and contro-
versy about it among them.
 ✓ Time is objective, except that it’s not. The 
general theory of relativity says that the 
clock in a fast-moving spaceship ticks 
more slowly the one on earth. That’s called 
time dilation.
 ✓ Time is real, except when it’s not. Imaginary 
time is a concept in quantum mechanics. 
Stephen Hawking discusses it in A Brief 
History of Time (Bantam).
 ✓ Time is infinite and eternal, except when 
it’s not. Love songs tell you time is eternal 
(sometimes singing of “forever” and some-
times “till the end of time”), but speculative 
physics suggests that time started with the 
Big Bang, and the Abrahamic faiths believe 
that time started with the Creation.
Is your head still in one piece? Writing about 
time can make a very long book, but we don’t 
have the time.

282
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
12-hour notation
If you live in the United States, you’re familiar with the 12-hour clock. In both 
analog and digital form, it’s the clock you typically use to tell time. Figure 18-1 
shows both analog and digital 12-hour clocks.
 
Figure 18-1: 
Two 12-hour 
clocks, 
analog and 
digital.

The 12-hour analog clock has numbers from 1 to 12 on the face. It’s under-
stood that the 12 hours represent either “a.m.” or “p.m.” It also has two hands, 
an hour hand (the short hand) and a minute hand (the long hand). On many 
clocks, the minute hand lines up with one of many small marks between the 
big numbers. Sometimes there’s a third, sweeping hand called a second hand.
After 12:59, you start counting minutes from 1:00, so the minute after 12:59 p.m.
is 1:00 p.m. To add to the confusion, the last minute of morning is 11:59 a.m. 
The first minute of afternoon isn’t 1:00 p.m.; it’s 12:00 p.m. (which is noon, 
not midnight, even though the p.m. may suggest nighttime).
 
a.m. comes from the Latin phrase ante meridiem and means “before midday.” 
p.m. is from the Latin word phrase post meridiem and means “after midday.”
It’s traditional. It’s American. It also makes telling time and time calculations 
harder for two reasons: 
 
✓ You have to figure out whether it’s “a.m.” or “p.m.” 
 
✓ You have to borrow or carry 12 a lot in time calculations.
24-hour notation
If you live outside the United States, work in aviation, or serve in the military, 
you more likely you use a 24-hour clock rather than a 12-hour clock (see the 
preceding section) to tell time. Figure 18-2 shows a 24-hour clock in both 
analog and digital form.

The 24-hour analog clock has numbers from 1 to 24 on its face. Each number 
is a distinct hour in the 24-hour day. Like the 12-hour analog clock, the 24-hour 
analog clock has an hour hand and a minute hand. The minute hand usually 
lines up with one of many small marks between the big numbers. Like the 
12-hour analog clock, the 24-hour analog clock frequently has a second hand. 
Also, there’s no need to designate “a.m.” or “p.m.” on a 24-hour digital clock.
After midnight (00:00), you start counting time from 0. The minute after mid-
night is 00:01 and the minute after 00:59 is 1:00. After the noon hour (12:00), 
the counting continues in the same way, so the minute after 12:59 is 13:00. 
The last minute of the day is 23:59.
Military time is the way you express time in the U.S. military and is an example 
of 24-hour notation in action. Here are some examples of how to say military 
time:
 
✓ If your work starts at 8:00 a.m., you start at “Oh [as in zero] eight hun-
dred hours.”
 
✓ An 11:00 a.m. meeting starts at “Eleven hundred hours.”
 
✓ If your work ends at 5:30 p.m. on the 12-hour clock, it’s 17:30 on 
the 24-hour clock. You say “Seventeen thirty hours.”
 
✓ If an activity begins at midnight, you say “24 hundred hours.”
Greenwich mean time (GMT)
Greenwich mean time (or GMT) is a world standard for time. GMT divides the 
world into 24 time zones. Each time zone is relative to the Royal Observatory 
at Greenwich (gren-ich), England, and covers about 15 longitudinal degrees 
of the earth’s circumference. Each time zone uses three letters to designate 
it. In aviation, GMT is practically identical to Zulu time (but we discuss that 
further in the following section).

284
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
In the continental United States, the times zones are eastern time (EST or 
EDT, depending on whether daylight saving time is in effect), central time 
(CST or CDT), mountain time (MST or MDT), and Pacific time (PST or PDT).
 
Greenwich mean time (or GMT) originally represented mean solar time, which 
was an approximation of true solar time. Neither mean solar time nor true 
solar time are accurate, because they don’t account for seasons of the year, 
the angles at which sunlight hits the earth, the gradual speeding up of the 
moon and the gradual slowing down of the earth. GMT has been replaced in all 
but name by Universal Time Coordinated (UTC — see the following section).
 
If you have a PC running Microsoft Windows, you can see all the time zones by 
clicking Start→Control Panel→Date and Time→Time Zone. All the time zones 
are there.
You express all the time zones as positive or negative “offsets” from GMT. 
For example, you express the time zone for Cairo or Jerusalem as GMT+2, 
UTC+2 or GMT/UTC+2.
 
You can see your offset from GMT in your e-mails. In Mozilla Thunderbird, 
select a message and click View→Message Source. In Microsoft Outlook, select 
a message, right click, and then click Message Options. The box that pops up 
shows you the message header, including the offset. Here is a message header 
showing an offset of GMT–8:
Mon, 18 Jan 2010 10:31:53 –0800
Because Greenwich is the center of things, the home of the prime meridian, 
its longitude is 0° 0’ 0”. Because each time zone accounts for 15 degrees 
of the earth’s circumference, a person who’s six time zones away from 
Greenwich (in, say, Chicago) is about 90 degrees or one quarter around the 
world from England.
UTC and Zulu time
Universal Time Coordinated is also known as UTC, Universal Time, and atomic 
time. By international agreement, UTC replaced GMT on January 1, 1972. 
Most people still use the term GMT.
Zulu time is another term for GMT/UTC. It’s used universally in aviation 
because it helps minimize confusion when flying between time zones. 
For example, the phrase, “Land the plane at 3:00 pm,” is meaningless in 
international aviation, as it could refer to the departure airport’s time zone 

285
 Chapter 18: Hold on a Second: Time Math
or the arrival airport’s time zone. Either of these might be following standard 
time or daylight saving time. Instead, all pilots use the same 24 hour clock.
Civilian time zone designations are three letters in length (for example, EST, 
CST, MST, and PST), while Zulu time zones have one-letter alphabetical des-
ignations. The follow example shows several offsets and a city in each time 
zone.

The time zone designations are taken from the NATO phonetic codes. The 
system doesn’t use the letter J, and the letters M and Y are special because 
they designate the area around the International Date Line: international time 
zone east (UTC+12) and international time zone west (UTC–12).
 
Zulu time isn’t named after the Zulu, the largest ethnic group in South Africa. 
It’s named after the time zone where the Greenwich Observatory is located.
Swahili time
Swahili time runs from dawn to dusk. If the day starts at what you’d call 
6:00 a.m., 7:00 a.m. is 1:00 in Swahili time. Figure 18-3 shows a 12-hour Swahili 
clock.

Swahili is a Bantu language. It’s the lingua franca (unofficial shared language) 
of much of east Africa and the national language of four countries. It’s also 
the main language of Tanzania (where there are 126 languages), even though 
English is the official language for school and the high courts.
Bible time
The Christian Bible treats the time of day in much the same way as Swahili 
time. The day starts at what you’d call 6:00 a.m. There are no clocks in the 
Bible, but modern advocates of a Bible clock place a 1 for the first hour at the 
start of the day. 
Consider the parable of the workers in the vineyard (also called the parable 
of the laborers in the vineyard or the parable of the generous employer) from 
Matthew 20:1–15.
1 For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in 
the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
2 After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into 
his vineyard.
3 And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the 
market place;
4 and to them he said, “You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is 
right I will give you.” So they went.
5 Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the 
same.
Figure 18-4 shows the time of day the employer sent laborers into the vine-
yard, using a Bible clock.

Converting Time
Time conversions aren’t difficult. You just need multiplication and division 
(both of which we cover in Chapter 5). You use the following conversion  factors:
 
✓ Minutes to seconds: 1 minute = 60 seconds
 
✓ Seconds to minutes: 60 seconds = 1 minute
 
✓ Hours to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes
 
✓ Minutes to hours: 60 minutes = 1 hour
Stardates
Sorry to say it, but stardates are completely fic-
tional. Executive Producer Gene Roddenberry 
invented them for the original 1966 Star Trek 
television series. Officially, a stardate is a deci-
mal number rounded to a single decimal place 
and used as a means of specifying absolute 
dates in the Star Trek universe. Unofficially, a 
stardate is a literary device designed to keep 
the screenwriter out of trouble. The idea behind 
stardates was to avoid mentioning the century 
Star Trek was set in (about 200 years in the 
future) and to avoid arguments about the plau-
sibility of some of the technology.
Originally, to make a stardate, you picked any 
combination of four numbers and added one digit 
after the decimal place. The day is divided into 
ten units with noon at the middle of the stardate, 
so, for example, 1421.5 is noon on a particular 
day, and 1422.5 is noon the next day. Stardates 
only have to be consistent within an episode.
You can find several stardate calculators 
online. Why more than one? Because the 
original series, its offshoots Star Trek: The Next 
Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space 9, and 
the Star Trek movies aren’t in exact agreement.

Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
You write hours and minutes as hh:mm, where hh represents the hours and 
mm the minutes. They’re separated by a colon (:). For example, 1:15 is 1 hour 
and 15 minutes. You write minutes and seconds as mm:ss; mm still stands for 
“minutes” and ss represents the seconds. For example, 12:13 is 12 minutes 
and 13 seconds. This notation can be easily confused with the hour-minute 
notation, but your problem will likely identify (or give you the info to iden-
tify) which units you’re dealing with. When you have hours, minutes, and 
seconds, write the expression as hh:mm:ss. For example, 1:17:45 is 1 hour, 
17 minutes, and 45 seconds.
Going from minutes to seconds 
and back again
When you have a time with only minutes, you can easily convert it to seconds 
by multiplying by 60 (because a minute contains 60 seconds). For example, to 
convert 3 minutes, the equation is
When you have minutes and seconds to convert, multiply the minutes by 60 
and add the remaining seconds. A sample equation (using 3:15) is
To go the other way and convert seconds to minutes, simply divide your 
number of seconds by 60 to get minutes. If you have seconds that are evenly 
divisible by 60 (using an example of 180 seconds), this division is really easy:
When the seconds aren’t evenly divisible by 60, you have leftover seconds. 
Perform the same division and then add the extra seconds into the answer. 
If you want to convert 195 seconds, use the following equation:
The answer is 3 minutes and 15 seconds, or 3:15.

289
 Chapter 18: Hold on a Second: Time Math
Changing hours to minutes and back again
The rules for converting hours to minutes and minutes to hours are practi-
cally identical to the minutes-to-seconds and seconds-to-minutes conversions 
in the preceding section.
If you have hours and no minutes, just multiply by 60 (because there 
are 60 minutes in an hour). For example, convert 4 hours with this equation:
When you have hours and minutes to convert, multiply the hours by 60 and 
add the extra minutes. A sample equation (using 2:30) is
To do the opposite conversion, divide the number of minutes by 60 to get the 
number of hours. If you have minutes that are evenly divisible by 60 (using an 
example of 300 minutes), you can use a simple equation:
When the minutes aren’t evenly divisible by 60, you have leftover minutes. Add 
these extra minutes into the answer. A sample equation (using 76 minutes) is
The answer is 1 hour and 16 minutes, or 1:16.
Working with time as a fraction
As we note earlier in the chapter, time typically appears expressed as hh:mm, 
mm:ss, or hh:mm:ss. But sometimes you see time expressed as a fraction, 
whether that’s a decimal fraction, a common fraction, or maybe even a per-
centage. Here are some examples:

290
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
The numbers used in denoting time and doing math about time are just 
that — numbers. They put on their pants one leg at a time, just like any other 
numbers. (Well, they would if they had legs and pants.) So the techniques 
for converting numbers don’t vary when you work with time. For example, 
50 percent of an hour is just like 50 percent of a pound of flour. And 50 per-
cent (a percentage) converts to 
(a common fraction) or to 0.5 (a decimal fraction).
You use the arithmetic you know to convert minutes (which are fractions of 
hours) and seconds (which are fractions of minutes) into fractions. You can 
also use the math you know and the time conversions in this chapter to con-
vert from fractions to hours, minutes, and seconds.
When you see a number representing minutes and seconds (1:30, for 
example), you think of it as “one minute and thirty seconds,” but it’s also 
“one minute and part of a minute” because those leftover seconds are some 
fraction of a minute. Here’s the conversion of 1:30 from time notation to a 
common fraction:
Of course, 
is also 0.5, so 1:30 is also 1.5 minutes. You get the common fraction for practi-
cally nothing, and the decimal is free.
 
You can find out more than you ever thought possible about fractions by look-
ing at Chapters 8, 9, and 10.
Time Math: Calculating Time
Time math isn’t difficult. It’s the same arithmetic you already know — the 
same arithmetic covered in other chapters throughout this book. The differ-
ences between time math and normal math are

291
 Chapter 18: Hold on a Second: Time Math
 
✓ The separator is a colon (:), not a decimal point (.)
 
✓ You borrow and carry at a different number (60) than you do with regu-
lar math (10).
 
✓ You don’t typically have to use fractions. You express any leftover amount 
in an operation as just what it is, a leftover number of seconds or minutes.
The following sections give you a whirlwind course in time arithmetic.
Addition
Time addition is handy when you sum up the total time expended for any activ-
ity. It’s also good when you need to add a duration to a start time to get an end 
time. (“If I start at 9:00 a.m. and the job takes two hours, I should be done at 
11:00 a.m.”) It works with a column of values just like regular addition does.
To add two time quantities together, follow these rules:
 
✓ Add like units, hh:mm to hh:mm and mm:ss to mm:ss.
 
✓ Express all factors as hh:mm:ss to make unlike units the same, filling in 
missing columns with zeroes as necessary to help everything line up.
For example, to add hours and minutes (such as 2:33) to minutes and sec-
onds (such as 45:45) write them both in the same format.
2:33 becomes 2:33:00
45:45 becomes 0:45:45
Add the terms together. If the seconds sum is more than 60, carry the excess 
to the next column like you would in normal addition. In this example, you 
end up with a term of 78 minutes:
The 78 minutes is 1 hour and 18 minutes, so convert 60 of those minutes to 
an hour and carry a 1 to the hours column (filling in the minutes and seconds 
columns with zeroes to keep everything lined up).
The answer is 3:18:45.

292
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
Subtraction
Time subtraction is useful when you want to schedule events or divide your 
time. It’s good when you need to subtract a duration from an end time to get 
a start time. (“If I need the casserole to be done at 11:00 a.m. and it takes two 
hours to bake, I should put it in the oven at 9:00 a.m.”)
To subtract two time quantities, follow these rules:
 
✓ Subtract like units, hh:mm from hh:mm and mm:ss from mm:ss.
 
✓ Express all factors as hh:mm:ss to make unlike units the same, filling in 
missing columns with zeroes to help everything line up.
For example, to subtract minutes and seconds (such as 45:45) from hours 
and minutes (such as 2:33) write them both in the same format: 
2:33 becomes 2:33:00
45:45 becomes 0:45:45
As with regular subtraction, if you don’t have enough seconds to subtract 
from, borrow from the minutes column; the same goes for borrowing hours 
to get enough minutes. For example:
You can’t have –45 seconds or –12 minutes, so do some borrowing. Borrow 
60 seconds (1 minute) from the minutes column and 60 minutes (1 hour) 
from the hours column so that you have 1 fewer hour, 59 more minutes, 
and 60 more seconds and try the math again:
The answer is 1:47:15.
Multiplication
Multiplying time values is helpful when you need to know the total time 
expended for repetitive tasks. You don’t multiply one time value by another 
time value; typically, you multiply a time value by a number. For example, 

293
 Chapter 18: Hold on a Second: Time Math
to figure the total time to do three equal tasks — say, 1 hour and 42 minutes 
(1:42) each— use an equation such as the following:
1:42 × 3 = ??:??
Multiply each column of units (in this case, the hours and minutes) by the 
multiplier (3). Be prepared to carry.
1:42 × 3 = 3:126
Wait! You can’t have 126 minutes, so convert them to hours. 126 minutes 
is 2 hours and 6 minutes. Add these 2 hours to the hours column and rewrite 
the answer:
3:126 = 5:06
The answer is 5:06.
Division
Dividing time values is useful when you want to economize on time or find 
new time values to fit into a busy schedule. You don’t usually divide one time 
value by another time value, although it’s possible. Typically, you divide a 
time value by a number. For example, say you want to cut a 1-hour-and-42-
minute (1:42) task in half:
1:42 ÷ 2 = ??:??
Divide each column of units.
1:42 ÷ 2 = 0.5:21
You can’t have 0.5 hours in the hours column, so convert the fractional hour 
to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. 
Add the converted minutes to the minutes from your original answer and 
rewrite the answer:
0.5:21 = 00:51
The answer is 00:51, or 51 minutes.

294

Example: The Timesheet for All Trades
The timesheet is universal because completing a timesheet for payroll is 
common in most fields. A similar situation is when you record and accumu-
late time to bill to a client.
 
This week has been tough for you at work. Monday was okay, but your child 
got sick and you came in late on Tuesday. You took a long lunch to take her 
to the doctor (amazingly, the pediatrician was able to squeeze her in). On 
Wednesday, her illness continued and you couldn’t get in until 1:00 p.m., 
so you only worked in the afternoon. The good news is that Thursday was 
normal and Friday was a paid holiday.
Your company doesn’t believe in family leave. The company’s enlightened 
policy is, “You’re lucky to have a job, so shut up.” Therefore, you get paid 
this week only for the hours you worked.
Figure 18-5 shows your completed timecard for this week. Calculate the daily 
hours you worked from the in and out times given and then add the hours to 
get your total regular hours. Combine those hours with holiday hours to get 
your total weekly hours.

The daily sums for Monday and Friday are already filled in. To complete the 
timecard, do the following:
 
1. Figure out your regular hours for Tuesday.
 
 Subtract 9:00 from 12:00 to get 3 hours for the morning time. Subtract 
2:00 from 5:00 to get 3 hours for the afternoon time. Add them together 
and write 6.0 in the regular hours field for Tuesday and in the total line.
 
2. Determine your regular hours for Wednesday.
 
 You were out all morning, so no hours there. Subtract 1:00 from 5:00 to 
get 4 hours for the afternoon time and write 4.0 in the regular hours field 
for Wednesday and in the total line.
 
3. Figure out your regular hours for Thursday.
 
 A nice normal day. The times are the same as for Monday, so just copy 
those figures.
 
4. Calculate your total regular hours for the week.
 
 Add the regular hours from each day and write the total (26.0 hours) in 
the appropriate cell in the TOTALS column.
 
5. Making sure to account for your Friday holiday hours, determine your 
total paid hours for the week.
 
 Write your holiday hours (8.0 hours) in the appropriate cell in the 
TOTALS column. Add the total from Step 4 to the 8 holiday hours from 
Friday. The sum is 34.0 hours, so. write that in the TOTAL box in the 
TOTALS column.
The answer is 34.0 hours. You lost 6 hours this week. It’s a shame, but at 
least your child is getting better.

T
he personal computer (PC) has shaken the world. There were 1 billion 
PCs in the world in 2007, and Business Week reports that Bill Gates wants 
to see that figure double by 2015. You don’t find as many PCs as you do cell-

Although computers often get a bad rap for being nerdy when their cousins 
the sports car and smartphone are sexy and cool, the computer is important 
in your work. Few careers can operate without them; even the artist uses a 
computer to run his or her art gallery, and the graphic artist today is a com-
puter artist. Not only is virtually every technical career tied in some way to 
the computer, but numerous technical and community colleges offer special 
two-year degrees in Computer Technology. 
Assuming that you’re going to have to live with computers, you need to 
understand a few things about a computer’s capacity and speed, so this 
chapter shows you some basic computer math.
You do a quick overview of numbers and units used with computing, use 
math to understand the computer’s parts, and prepare yourself to make

Try a Bit of This Byte: Understanding 
Basic Computer Terms
No matter whether you make computers your full-time career or just use 
them in your work, you’re more computer savvy when you know a few words. 
Take a minute to check out the two important words always associated with 
computers: bit and byte.
A bit, also known as a binary digit, is the smallest unit of information a com-
puter can store. It has only two states, off and on, which are represented by 
two different current or voltage levels (known as high and low).
The two states represent 0 and 1, the only numbers in the digit-challenged 
binary number system (which we cover in Chapter 11). But despite its lack of 
numerical variety, the binary system can easily manage, manipulate, and dis-
play big numbers — and all the characters of the alphabet — in a computer.
Here’s an example of using binary numbers to communicate information. Yes, 
folks, you can try this at home.
Your business has a neon “Open” sign that has two states, ON and OFF. 
The following table shows what the state of the switch can communicate to 
people who drive by.
Switch
Meaning
ON
We’re open.
OFF
We’re closed.
Two bits can say a lot more than one bit, because they offer four possible com-
binations of the states (OFF/OFF, OFF/ON, ON/OFF, and ON/ON). Say you want 
to visit a friend’s home, where the living room light and the bedroom light are 
each controlled by a switch. The following table shows what the states of the 
two switches can communicate to you when you drive by the house.
Switch 1 
(Living Room)
Switch 2 
(Bedroom)
Meaning
ON
ON
I’m home and I’m getting dressed.
ON
OFF
I’m home. Do drop in.
OFF
ON
It’s late. I’m reading in bed.
OFF
OFF
I’m asleep. Don’t bother knocking.

299
 Chapter 19: Math for Computer Techs and Users
Just like your friend’s two lights can give more complete information than 
your business’s one sign, you can communicate more ideas when you use 
bits in combination. The combinations of bits a computer uses to represent 
numbers and characters are grouped into eight-bit bytes. The byte is the 
most common unit you use to measure a computer’s capacity.
An A is stored on the computer as the eight bits 01000001. The number 9 is 
stored on the computer as the eight bits 00111001. Of course, bits and bytes 
get a lot more complicated than this example, but leave that part to the 
 specialists.
 
People can’t agree on where the word byte came from. One source says “The 
word byte is short for binary digit eight.” Another source says IBM declared 
that it stood for “Binary Yoked Transfer Element (BYTE).” The most credible 
source says, “The term was coined by Werner Buchholz [at IBM] in 1956 . . .  
It was a mutation of the word ‘bite’ intended to avoid confusion with ‘bit.’”
Because computers hold so many bits and bytes, the amounts of these 
units are often expressed with the old standby Greek prefixes we discuss in 
Chapter 11. You need to know kilo-, mega-, giga-, and tera- to talk computer 
talk. The following handy table gives you a crib sheet.
From analog to digital in the 21st century
Today is an age of incredible advancement in 
technology. Almost every day, you see or read 
about innovations in healthcare, pharmaceuti-
cals, green building materials, and electronics.
You see digital replacements for analog (read: 
old-style) devices everywhere, including the 
chef’s digital thermometer and digital timer, 
the surveyor’s digital theodolite, and the auto-
mobile tech’s diagnostic computer. Even the 
x-ray machine in the dental office displays the 
“x-ray” on a monitor. You can also get digital 
micrometers, digital body mass index measure-
ment tools, and digital shipping scales.
You can also see (and maybe be overwhelmed 
by) the many general-purpose devices available. 
They include smartphones, digital cameras, 
camcorders, MP3 players, and high definition 
televisions. You use them both in business and 
at home.
The runner-up in the digital advancement game 
is the mobile phone (formerly called the cell-
phone). Mobiles are everywhere: Police use 
them in addition to their radios, and fishermen 
use them to land their boats at the port where 
they can get the best prices for their catches. 
The CIA’s 2009 Factbook lists the number of 
mobile cellular telephone subscribers in 222 
countries at nearly 4 billion! Even in a world 
with a population of almost 7 billion, that’s 
a whole lotta cellphones. But for first place, 
the gold medal, the Heisman trophy, and the 
Hawaiian vacation with the matched luggage, 
the winner is the personal computer.

To find personal happiness, you need to talk to a man in a saffron robe, sit-
ting on top of a mountain. To find PC happiness, the answer is simpler: More 
is better.
With PCs, greater capacity and greater speed seem to make the difference in 
performance. If your PC is running slowly, you don’t have enough of some-
thing. Knowing a little about the following items helps you become a well-
informed computer user and computer purchaser. That’s a big step toward 
achieving PC happiness. Om!
 
✓ Disk capacity in megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes
 
✓ Flash memory capacity in megabytes and gigabytes
 
✓ RAM (random access memory) in gigabytes
 
✓ Processor rate in hertz
 
✓ DVD write speed
 
✓ Network speed in kilobits, megabits, and gigabits per second
Some people say they don’t know anything about computers, or that they 
don’t understand them. Then (and they’re rationalizing) they say that they 
don’t care. Don’t you become part of “some people!”
 
Remember, the automobile and healthcare industries require bigger vocabu-
laries and require more complicated choices than understanding computers 
does. You can get a handle on computers if you put your mind to it.

Disk capacity
A “good” PC has lots of storage capacity. “Lots” varies depending on whether 
you store mostly documents (relatively small files), mostly photos (relatively 
large files), or other stuff (a mix). But you can generally follow this rule of 
thumb: Get the biggest disk drive you can afford. This guideline applies 
equally to medical offices, construction company offices, and food service 
offices, and to laptop computers used in all trades.
Bigger is better. And disk storage is pretty cheap. Currently, most disk drives 
are in the 200- to 300-GB range, but offerings of 0.5TB, 1.0TB, and 1.5TB are start-
ing to appear on the Internet and in retail stores. In extreme cases, you can put 
multiple disk drives (“multiple spindles”) inside the case of a desktop computer 
or even add external storage by connecting a portable disk drive to a USB port.
Figure 19-1 shows the properties of a typical disk drive on a PC.

Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
The math concepts you need to evaluate a disk drive are a knowledge of the 
units (gigabytes and terabytes) and a grasp of whole numbers. Basic arith-
metic and percentages are useful, too, if you’re calculating how much of the 
drive you’re using. (You don’t have to do calculations, but they can come in 
handy.)
Notice that the capacity in Figure 19-1 is 249,975,700,360 bytes. If you check 
your receipt or your packing slip, this figure makes sense — you probably 
bought a computer with a 250GB disk drive.
So why does the window also say that 232GB is a capacity? Because that’s 
what you have left after formatting the drive. The computer requires a bit of 
“overhead” space for disk formatting, writing file system data (for file name, 
creation date, access permissions, and contents), and so on.
Figure 19-1 also shows the amount of space you’ve used and the amount of 
free space. If you want, you can calculate percent utilization. The formula is
To make things simple, use the number of gigabytes displayed as being avail-
able (in this case, 232), not the full number of bytes the computer started out 
with (250).
The disk is 17.6 percent full.
Flash memory
Flash memory isn’t actually memory but rather computer storage on a chip. It 
was invented by Dr. Fujio Masuoka in 1984 when he was working for Toshiba. 
These days, you typically call flash memory a flash drive, which is a computer 
storage device that acts like a disk. It has a drive letter, and you manage it 
the same way you would any other disk on your computer. A USB (univer-
sal serial bus) flash drive gives you portable, compact storage. Flash drives 
are also embedded in digital cameras, handheld computers, mobile phones, 
music players, digital video cameras, video game consoles, and GPS devices.
You measure flash drive capacity in megabytes and gigabytes. When you buy 
flash drives, the math required is simply knowledge of units (megabytes and 

303
 Chapter 19: Math for Computer Techs and Users
gigabytes) and whole numbers. The stores have flash drives with capacities 
of 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB. 
Some available flash drives go as high as 256 gigabytes.
 
Toshiba tried to demote Fujio Masuoka after he invented what became the 
most important semiconductor innovation in recent times, even though the 
chips went into products worth more than $3 trillion, including automobiles, 
computers and mobile phones. To cover their embarrassment, Toshiba said 
that Intel invented flash memory, but no, Intel says Toshiba did it.
Rama lama ding dong: RAM memory
Random access memory (RAM), also called volatile memory, is the memory 
your computer uses to run programs while it’s on. After you turn the com-
puter off, that “remembered” information is gone. Technically speaking, RAM 
is storage on integrated circuits (chips) on your computer’s motherboard. It 
used to be measured in megabytes but is now described in gigabytes.
 
If you work in an area with a lot of power outages, you’re in danger of losing 
your unsaved work when the electricity goes out. If that sounds like your situ-
ation, you may want to buy an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). A UPS has a 
battery and gives you about 20 minutes of time during a blackout to save your 
work and shut the computer down. If you don’t want to buy a UPS, remember 
to save your work frequently.
It’s good to have a lot of RAM, and it’s a better idea to have a humongous 
amount of RAM. Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows 7 want about 1GB of 
RAM just to run, so your computer should have a minimum of 2GB of RAM. 
Three or four GB of RAM are even better.
 
ROM (read-only memory) isn’t the same as RAM. ROM is also located in 
chips on the motherboard, but it holds the information used to boot up the 
computer.
Speed out of the gate: Processor rate
The speed of your computer’s central processing unit (CPU) was a traditional 
way of determining how fast your computer was. However, times have 
changed. Overall computer speed is a combination of factors that we don’t 
get into here, plus the fact that speed is purely subjective. If the computer 
seems slow to you, it is slow.

304
Part IV: Math for the Business of Your Work 
You measure processor speed in hertz (Hz), the international unit for fre-
quency (not the rental car company). One Hz is equal to one cycle per 
second, which is nothing to write home about. Computers are considerably 
faster.
Although processor function is measured as a speed, it’s not really a speed. A 
computer’s CPU has a clock rate, or the number of processing cycles the CPU 
can perform in one second. The faster the clock, the more instructions the com-
puter can process in that second. Today’s small computers run at rates as high 
as 2.66 GHz. The math you need to evaluate a CPU consists of understanding 
the units and decimal fractions (for example 2.20 GHz, 2.40 GHz, and so on).
 
In the 1990s, the “speed wars” between manufacturers resulted in consumer 
confusion. One manufacture advertised having the highest clock rate, but 
the comparison was meaningless, since the competitors used a superior 
“architecture.”
The best way to evaluate processor speed when you’re buying a computer 
is to see whether it has one (single), two (dual), or four (quad) processor 
cores, which are separate CPUs integrated into one integrated circuit. Simply 
put, a quad computer is a hot computer. When you’re buying, also check out 
the amount of L2 Cache each system has (for example, 2MB are good, but 6MB 
are great).
Speed is always increasing; history shows that computer speeds double 
about every 18 to 20 months. No wonder your computer seems to be out of 
date every time you turn around.
The Internet is running on “slow” 
today: Network speed
As with other components of your “computing experience” (as the marketing 
departments call it), network speed is important. The term network describes 
any connection between two or more computers and can include just your 
computer connected to the Internet, all the computers at your office, or any 
other linking of computers. 
As the name suggests, network speed is simply how fast your network oper-
ates. It’s measured in bits (not bytes; see the earlier section “Try a Bit of This 
Byte: Understanding Basic Computer Terms” for more on the difference), 
and faster is better. The unit of measurement for network speed is megabits 
per second (Mbps). You also see kilobits per second (Kbps) and gigabits per 
second (Gbps). The math for network speed consists of understanding these 
terms and comparing simple numbers.

305
 Chapter 19: Math for Computer Techs and Users
Your workplace (and maybe your home) is likely to have a local area network 
(LAN). That’s what connects the computers to each other (using a switch) 
and to the Internet (using a router and a DSL or cable modem). DSL (digital 
subscriber line) is a popular method used for sending data over a telephone 
line. You probably have DSL at work and at home. Cable modems hook you 
up to the Internet through your cable TV connection. Cable tends to be 
faster, but surveys indicate that customer satisfaction with cable is lower 
than with DSL.
Your PC can talk to other PCs and servers no faster than the speed of its 
internal network interface card (NIC). And your network switch poses an addi-
tional speed limitation. In the last few years, network speeds have gone 
from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. Now 1 gigabit per second (1 Gbps) is common. 
To be really fast, do the following:
 
✓ Upgrade your PC to a 1 Gbps NIC.
 
✓ Upgrade your switch to a 1 Gbps switch.
 
✓ When you shop for Ethernet cables, buy CAT6 or CAT5e cables. Those 
types are what you need for gigabit Ethernet.
 
✓ If you do wireless, you own a WAP (a wireless access point, also called a 
hotspot). Even at a “nominal” 100 Mbps, real performance tends to 
be 54 Mbps. Expect the same sort of diminished performance if you buy 
a gigabit hotspot.
 
The speed of your connection to other computers on the Internet (mail serv-
ers and web servers) will vary, depending on how much you pay.
You may buy DSL with varying download and upload rates. The download 
rate is how fast data is (theoretically) coming in to your computer, while the 
upload rate is how fast data is (theoretically) going from your machine to 
a server somewhere else (for example, your bank, eBay, or Amazon.com). 
Actual speed is a little lower. The following table shows you four rates from a 
major Internet service provider.

From the table, you see that you get increased download and upload speed 
by paying more money per month.
 
How fast is your DSL connection? You can find out with any of the DSL 
speed tests on the Internet. Try Speakeasy at www.speakeasy.net/
speedtest/
 
ISDN (integrated services digital network) is another communication stan-
dard, but it has been overtaken by DSL. ISDN is costly and slow, and it’s a very 
1990s technology. It has some value for videoconferencing, but it has never 
really been popular in the United States and Canada. In computer slang, ISDN 
stands for “it still does nothing.”
Burn, baby, burn: DVD write speed
You won’t live forever, so it’s nice to burn CDs and DVDs as fast as possible. 
Today’s DVD drives allow you to use the same drive to record on both media.
With a DVD, the sign X is the unit for DVD drive speed. The math you must 
apply here is easy. Simply look for the X number to get a feeling for relative 
drive recording speed. An 8X drive is eight times faster than a 1X drive; 1X 
represents a recording transfer rate of 1,385,000 in bytes per second, and an 
8X drives writes at 11,080,000 bytes per second. That’s a lot faster. 8X is what 
you commonly see in stores these days, but speed figures can go up to 24X.
The rules of thumb for buying a DVD drive are simple:
 
✓ When you buy a new computer, get the DVD drive that comes with the 
system — that’s probably an 8X DVD burner.
 
✓ When you want to record and play back high-definition video, buy a Blu-
ray DVD drive. You can’t play or record Blu-ray DVDs on a conventional 
DVD drive.
 
✓ When you’re buying an external DVD drive with a USB connection 
(sometimes called an “outboard drive”), buy just about anything that’s 
on sale. You determine what gives you the most value for the money.
The capacities of DVDs and CDs vary. You can find out a lot by going to the 
Web sites of computer manufacturers. Some (Dell, for example) show you the 
number of documents, presentations, photos, and MP3 files you can expect 
to store on each type of disk. For example, a 700MB CD can store about 175 
four-minute MP3 tunes, while a 50GB Blu-ray DVD can store about 12,494 
tunes. Whew! That last figure is whole lot of songs.

307
 Chapter 19: Math for Computer Techs and Users
 
Older car CD players won’t play MP3 files. They play AU files. Newer CD play-
ers do play MP3, but they won’t play iTunes MP4 files. However, you can find 
free file-conversion software on the Internet.
Example: Total Capacity of 
a Mass Storage System
This example problem isn’t for the faint-hearted, or at least that’s the way it 
looks at first. In reality, it’s not hard at all. “Difficult” calculations are often 
made up of smaller, easy calculations. Here, technical math meets reality:
 
You’re a storage specialist at a medium-sized corporation and will soon take 
delivery of a new Hewlett-Packard XP20000 disk array. A disk array is a set of 
disk drives, ranging from 4 to 1,024 drives in number, installed in from 1 to 7 
cabinets.
The array has a maximum capacity of 236 drives, but your company 
bought 68 drives to start. The purchase includes
 
✓ 34 fast drives (600GB drives spinning at 15,000 RPM)
 
✓ 34 slow drives (2TB drives spinning at 7,200 RPM)
As you’d expect, the salesman sold the nominal storage capacity (80.4TB), and 
if you multiply the number of drives by their advertised capacity, that’s the 
answer you get. The question is, what’s the real storage capacity of the array?
Allow for the following factors in your calculation:
 
✓ You lose 9 percent of the capacity to disk formatting (that’s 0.09, 
leaving 0.91).
 
✓ The data protection and recovery structure causes you to lose 25 per-
cent of the capacity (the system will write the data for every three 
600GB disks on four 600GB disks and for every three 2TB disks on four 
2TB disks).
 
✓ You hold out two unused hot spares (for automatic recovery) at 600GB 
each (one for every sixteen 600GB drives).
 
✓ You also hold out two unused hot spares (for automatic recovery) at 
2TB each (one for every sixteen 2TB drives).

Coauthor Barry is originally from multicultural Los Angeles, so about this 
problem he’d say “¡Ay, caramba!” and “Oy vay iz mir!” in the same breath. 
And yet you can use any of several orderly approaches to handling the 
simple math required for this problem. Here’s one version.
 
1. Note what you already know.
 
 You have the nominal capacity of the disk drives purchased (80.4TB). 
Set that number aside for later, just to compare with the calculated 
result. You also know the number of number of drives (34 2TB drives 
and 34 600MB drives).
 
2. Remove the hot spares from your calculations.
 
 They don’t come into play until one of the in-use drives fails.
 
• 34 2TB drives – 2 2TB drives = 32 2TB drives
 
• 34 600GB drives – 2 600GB drives = 32 600GB drives
 
3. Calculate the capacity of the drives after formatting (91 percent of 
nominal capacity).
 
 You need a capacity number for each type of drive.
 
• 2TB × 0.91 = 1.82TB
 
• 600MB × 0.91 = 546GB
 
4. Determine how many drives you lose to the data protection and recov-
ery structure.
 
 You lose 25 percent of your capacity, so 0.25 × 32 drives = 8 drives lost 
for each drive type. You now have 24 2TB drives and 24 600GB drives 
available for storage.
 
5. Multiply the number of drives remaining by their respective format-
ted capacities from Step 3.
 
 The formatted capacities are 1.82TB and 546GB, respectively.
 
• 24 × 1.82TB = 45.68TB
 
• 24 × 546GB = 13,104GB = 13.10TB
 
6. Add the two capacities.
 
 45.68TB + 13.10TB = 58.78TB. Your total storage capacity is 58.78TB.

Any Math Problem
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing and filtering given information
▶ Identifying and seeking out needed information
▶ Staying organized and checking your results
M
ath problems may look different from each other, but they’re surpris-
ingly similar. Many of the math questions you encounter in a particu-
lar career come up over and over again. For example, a graphic artist doing 
book design calculates cover dimensions, spine width, and margins many 
times for different books. Also, many similar math questions come up in all 
careers, especially questions about time and money.
Regardless of your field, you have to solve the math questions you come 
across, and this chapter gives you the principles to do just that. You may not 
use all of the principles all the time, but you’ll use a good portion of them. 
Think of Sherlock Holmes, the greatest detective of all time. He investigated 
many different kinds of mysteries, but he consistently applied the same 
excellent reasoning.
Figure Out Exactly What 
the Problem Asks For
Know what you’re trying to find. Often, the instructions clearly state what 
the problem is asking you to find, but sometimes the needed answer is a little 
obscure. People are people. They aren’t perfect, and their communication 

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
with you isn’t always perfect either. Here are a few guidelines for determining 
what the problem is asking for:
 
✓ If you get an e-mail or a memo, read it carefully — twice — to make 
sure you’ve got a handle on all the facts it includes. Of course, a note 
filled with facts and an exact question is much more helpful than one 
with a vague question like “How much will it cost to paint the Jones resi-
dence?”, but you have to carefully examine the facts to figure out just 
how much info they give you.
 
✓ If someone gives you the problem orally, carefully write it down. In 
the building trades, this step is very important when you’re dealing 
with client specifications. Your goal is to provide exactly what the client 
wants, and that’s a lot easier to remember when you have it in writing.
 
✓ Find the keywords. Look for phrases like “How much?”, “When?”, and 
“How many?” They clue you in to what the problem wants.
 
✓ Start to form a mental picture of how you may find the answer. Do you 
need to count? Calculate areas? Use simple arithmetic? Use a trigonom-
etry triangle? For example, if the question is about the cost of carpeting 
five rooms, it suggests that you must calculate the area to be covered 
before figuring a price.
List the Facts
Identify and list the facts. If you go over all the information, you find (or 
should find) most of what you need. From this list, you convert the informa-
tion, find what’s missing, and eliminate what’s excessive. We cover these 
steps in the following three sections.
 
Get organized and stay organized. You don’t want to overlook any facts, and 
messy note-taking may cause you to lose facts. If you’re doing the work on 
paper, tiny sticky notes don’t cut it. Get a nice big legal pad.
Convert Supplied Information 
into Needed Information
Sometimes information is like a bad Christmas gift — it comes in the wrong 
size, shape, or color. You may have plenty of information to solve a problem, 

313
 Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Solving Any Math Problem
but it isn’t worth anything until you make it usable. Luckily, you may be able 
to convert the facts you have into the facts you need.
For example, in a medical office, you may convert from metric to American 
units to describe how much of a substance a patient should take. The 
Institute of Medicine (the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences) 
recommends that pregnant women drink 2.3 liters of water per day. But most 
Americans measure in ounces, so you need to be able to convert that figure 
to let your patients know how many 8 ounce glasses that equals. (The answer 
is 9.7 glasses per day.)
Sometimes you have to convert subjective data into hard facts. For example, 
if a painting client says, “I want to do the bedroom in sort of a robin’s egg 
blue,” you need to convert that information into a fact — the exact paint 
color and brand — before you can price the job.
Determine What Information 
You’re Missing
The fact list and conversions from the preceding two sections help you see 
the information you have. What remains to find is the information you’re 
still missing. Your mind will say, “Hey, wait a minute!” as you realize that the 
problem can’t be solved without more information.
Sometimes filling in this info is a matter of (diplomatically) asking the boss or 
the client, “Hey, what did you mean by this?” It’s better to ask questions than 
to make a major error because of missing facts. In the worst case, you can do 
two things: assume or estimate. Sometimes these techniques are necessary, 
but they’re never as good as having the facts.
Eliminate Excess Information
Sometimes you get all the information you need and then some. When you 
get a lot of information, dismiss any excess information that doesn’t help you 
find the solution.
When people express a math problem verbally, be an active listener. When 
a concern comes up in a staff meeting, the real problem may be hiding in the 
fluff — opinions, discussions about personalities, or office trivia. Filter out 

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
the excess, but stay open to minor facts that affect your solution. You can 
do the same thing with written problems, too.
For example, you may think a statement like “Joe has the exact prices for the 
fencing lumber, but he’s on vacation in Hawaii” has nothing to do with your 
problem, but it’s actually a signal to you that you can’t rely on Joe for cost-
ing a job. Instead, you need stored information (maybe your own experience, 
previous contracts in paper files, or spreadsheets stored on your computer), 
online sources, and maybe an Internet calculator. No, Joe’s being in Hawaii 
doesn’t actually help you figure out the lumber cost, but it does let you know 
that he isn’t available as an info source for your problem-solving process.
Draw a Diagram
Use a diagram to help visualize the problem. The expression “Let me show 
you” is very powerful, and you often see things in a simple drawing that 
you’d miss just looking at numbers.
 
A diagram is often useful for visualizing counting problems, including inven-
tory, parts distribution, and patient dosing. Just draw some circles on a piece 
of paper. The circles represent locations. Use symbols that place the items 
in different locations. This method can work for lubricants in multiple auto 
service locations, tool inventory for multiple CNC work modules, emergency 
medical supply pre-need placements, pantry stocking at multiple kitchens, and 
so forth.
 
Use the charts described in Chapter 17 if they apply. You may also want to 
make a table of values. Draw floor plans or property plans if you need to. 
When you sense that you must calculate the relative proportions of “things,” 
make a simple pie chart. A pie chart shows the proportion of things you have 
to each other.
Find or Develop a Formula
When you see the nature of the problem, find or develop a formula to solve 
it. (See Chapter 13 for the discussion of the time/distance/speed standard 
formula or the burgers-and-fries custom formula.) Every problem requiring 
math has an underlying formula. Even counting three apples uses the formula 
x = 1 + 1 + 1.

315
 Chapter 20: Ten Tips for Solving Any Math Problem
Some of the calculations you do are so commonplace to you that you prob-
ably have memorized them. For example, a cement truck holds eight cubic 
yards of concrete. You can use that formula (1 truck = 8 CY) every time when 
you’re planning a pour.
Some calculations rely on a well-established formula. For example, there’s a 
formula for the feed rate of a machine tool (Inches per minute = RPM × Inches 
per flute × Number of flutes). If you know your material and your tool bit, you 
can customize the formula and keep it forever. For example, if you’re cutting 
0.19 inches deep into 3003 aluminum, using a .25-inch two-flute bit at 20,000 
RPM, you can go at about 80 inches per minute.
 
Don’t forget real life experience. For example, if the feed rate breaks the tool 
(which it shouldn’t) or damages the workpiece (which it shouldn’t), you’ve 
learned a valuable lesson and know to modify the formula next time.
After you have formulas for the problems you regularly solve, calculation is 
fast and easy.
Consult a Reference
No one has a perfect memory, and no one expects you to have one either. 
Rely on your external memory. That is, consult references as needed. For 
example, only a few older machinists have memorized the decimal equiva-
lents of the 63 fractional drill sizes from 1/64 inch to 63/64 inch. This memori-
zation used to be commonplace, but today most machinists use a conversion 
chart.
If your company has printed reference materials (such as lumber price 
guides, metal machining specifications, or successful recipes), take advan-
tage of them. You can also go to the Internet to find many conversion charts, 
conversion calculators, and facts about materials. Just remember that the 
Internet is far from perfect. Do some research before you place your trust in 
a single Web site.
Pay Attention to Units
Watch units and unit conversions. They can throw an answer way off. 
Combine like units and don’t combine unlike units; feet and meters (each 

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
from a different measurement system) don’t combine. For that matter, feet 
and miles (both from the American measurement system) don’t combine, 
either. Because you need like units to do the math, be prepared to convert 
units to get compatible figures. 
When you have a final answer, be prepared to convert units to a form that cli-
ents and vendors can understand. For example, a recipe may call for 384 fluid 
ounces of cream, but your supplier expects you to order 3 gallons. You can 
use a table of conversions on the Internet, a calculator, or your own memory 
to find conversion factors.
Check Your Answer to See 
whether It’s Reasonable
Test your answers for reasonableness. Experience is a great help, so if you 
don’t have a lot of experience, consult with a co-worker. For example, if you 
calculate concrete needed to pour a residential patio and the answer is 14 
truckloads, you probably messed up. That’s 112 yards! The units are wrong 
or the math is wrong; maybe you didn’t convert the cubic feet you got cal-
culating the patio’s volume into cubic yards, the number that the concrete 
company needs.
 
You can recalculate the math used in a problem in numerous ways, including 
adding columns from the bottom up or turning subtraction results into an 
addition problem. Test your results. And by keeping your work neat, you more 
easily see incorrect units or a bad unit conversion.

branches, including the study of numbers, sets, probability, and statis-
tics, and they all have formulas. The good news is that technical math uses 
far fewer formulas, and only a few of those come up all the time. This chapter 
lists the ten formulas you probably use most frequently and shows you some 
shortcuts. As a bonus, you often can use one formula two or three ways.
Area of a Square, Rectangle, or Triangle
In some trades, you find areas all the time, so at some point, you invariably 
need to calculate the area of a rectangle, square, or triangle (such as to pave 
a parking lot or landscape a yard). The most common unit of square measure 
is the square foot. (Chapter 15 gives you more information on areas.)
 
✓ Area of a rectangle/square: To calculate the area of a rectangle or a 
square, the formula is A = L × W, where L is the length and W is the width.
 
 A handy shortcut: When you know two of the terms, you can use this 
formula to find the third term. If you know the area and the length, you 
can calculate the width. If you know the area and the width, you can cal-
culate the length.

✓ Area of a triangle. To calculate the area of a triangle, the formula is
 
 where b is the base and h is the height.
 
 As a shortcut, when you know two of the terms, you can use this formula 
to find the third term. If you know the area and the base, you can calcu-
late the height. If you know the area and the height, you can calculate 
the base.
Area of a Circle
Many trades (such as machining and landscaping) work with surfaces shaped 
in circles, so knowing how to find a circle’s area comes in handy. Flip to 
Chapter 15 for more on dealing with the areas of circles.
To calculate the area of a circle, the formula is A = πr2 (A = π × r × r), where r 
is the radius of the circle and π is 3.14159.
 
If you know the diameter of the circle but not the radius, remember that the 
radius is one-half the diameter.
If you want a rough shortcut calculation, use
for pi.
A handy shortcut: When you know the area, you can use this formula to find 
the radius.
Feet to Meters and Inches to Centimeters
Metric units and American units don’t mix (see Chapter 6 for more on these 
systems), so the ability to convert measurements from one system to another 
is handy. The two most common small measurement conversions are feet to 
meters and inches to centimeters.
 
✓ Feet to meters: The conversion factor for feet to meters is 1 foot = 0.3048 
meters.
 
 All you have to do is multiply your measurement in feet by 0.3048 to get 
the measurement meters. 100 feet, for example is 30.48 meters. A good 
estimation shortcut is that a foot is about one third of a meter.

319
 Chapter 21: Ten Formulas You’ll Use Most Often
 
✓ Meters to feet: The conversion factor for meters to feet is 1 meter = 3.28 
feet. Multiply your measurement in meters by 3.28 to get the measure-
ment in feet. A 100-meter race is 328 feet long. As a rule of thumb, a 
meter is about 39 inches.
 
✓ Inches to centimeters. The conversion factor for inches to centimeters 
is 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters. Just multiply your measurement in inches 
by 2.54. You can also estimate that four inches equals about ten centi-
meters.
 
✓ Centimeters to inches. The conversion factor for centimeters to inches 
is 1 centimeter = 0.39 inches. Multiply your measurement in centimeters 
by 0.39. A child who is 152 centimeters tall is about 60 inches tall. As a 
shortcut in converting centimeters to inches, just multiply centimeters 
by 4 and divide the result by 10.
Miles to Kilometers and 
Kilometers to Miles
The difference between metric and American units can make measuring dis-
tances difficult. Automobile odometers still record miles, but for many years 
car speedometers have had kilometers per hour on a scale next to miles per 
hour.
If you work with distances (for example, in surveying and fighting wildfires), 
or drive as part of your work (for example, as an emergency medical tech-
nician), converting between American and metric units may become very 
important. 
 
✓ Miles to kilometers: The conversion factor for miles to kilometers 
is 1 mile = 1.609 kilometers. Multiply your miles measurement by 1.609 
to get the distance in kilometers. For example, when a city is 100 miles 
away, it’s 160.9 kilometers away.
 
 You can make a very rough conversion of miles to kilometers by multi-
plying miles by 1.5.
 
✓ Kilometers to miles: The conversion factor for kilometers to miles 
is 1 kilometer = 0.6214 miles. Multiply your measurement in kilometers 
by 0.6214. As a shortcut, a kilometer is about 0.6 of a mile, so if a city 
is 100 kilometers away, it’s about 60 miles (actually 62.14 miles) away.

Pounds to Kilograms and 
Ounces to Grams
If you work in the culinary field, you may run across recipes with ingredients 
measured in another unit system. (Check out Chapter 6 for more on measure-
ments and conversions.) The following conversions can help you make the 
switch.
 
✓ Pounds to kilograms: The conversion factor for pounds to kilograms 
is 1 pound = 0.454 kilograms. All you need to do is multiply the number 
of pounds by 0.454. For example, 100 pounds of sugar weigh 45.4 
kilograms.
 
✓ Kilograms to pounds: The conversion factor for kilograms to pounds 
is 1 kilogram = 2.2046 pounds. Multiply your measurement in kilograms 
by 2.2046 to get pounds. A person who weighs 100 kilograms weighs 
220 pounds.
 
✓ Ounces to grams: The conversion factor for ounces to grams is 
1 ounce = 28.35 grams. Just multiply the number of ounces by 28.35.
 
✓ Grams to ounces: The conversion factor for grams to ounces is 1 gram = 
0.3527 ounces. Multiply your measurement in grams by 0.3527 to con-
vert to ounces.
Gallons to Liters and Liters to Gallons
In the United States, gasoline is sold by the gallon, but it’s sold by the liter 
in many other countries. Chefs also often find liquids labeled with both 
American units (quarts and fluid ounces) and metric units (liters).
 
✓ Gallons to liters: The conversion factor for gallons to liters is 1 gallon = 
3.785 liters. Multiply the number of gallons by 3.785 to get the number of 
liters.
 
 If you have a measurement in quarts but not gallons, remember that a 
gallon contains four quarts. Multiply your quart measurement by 0.9463 
(that’s also the same as 3.785 ÷ 4) to get the liter measurement.
 
✓ Liters to gallons: The conversion factor for liters to gallons is 1 liter = 
0.264 gallons. All you do is multiply your measurement in liters by 0.264 
to get gallons.

Temperature Conversions
Temperature in the United States is traditionally measured using the 
Fahrenheit scale, but if your work includes contact with people in other coun-
tries (or working with instructions written by those in other countries), you 
are likely to encounter temperatures expressed using the Celsius scale. It’s 
useful to be able to convert from one system to the other.
 
✓ Fahrenheit to Celsius: To convert a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit 
to a temperature in degrees Celsius, subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit 
 
 temperature and then multiply the result by . Here’s what the formula 
looks like:
 
✓ Celsius to Fahrenheit: To convert from degrees Celsius to degrees 
Fahrenheit, just multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5 and add 32 to 
the result. Here’s that formula:
Hours to Minutes and Minutes to Hours
The need to convert hours and minutes occurs in all trades when you cal-
culate client billing or hours worked. In the culinary arts, time conversion is 
especially important, as cooking often requires several different dishes to be 
prepared simultaneously.
 
✓ Hours to minutes: As you’ve probably heard, there are 60 minutes in 
an hour, so to convert from hours to minutes, just multiply the number 
of hours by 60 to get the number of minutes.
 
✓ Minutes to hours: To convert minutes to hours, simply divide the 
number of minutes by 60.
 
 When the minutes aren’t evenly divisible by 60, you have leftover min-
utes. Add these extra minutes into the answer. For example, 76 minutes 
converts to 1 hour, 16 minutes.

Distance, Time, and Speed
If your work includes driving or flying and it’s time-sensitive, it’s essential to 
be able to calculate distance based on time and speed. Critical applications 
include delivering medications to hospitals and nursing homes and trans-
porting organs for transplant.
Time, speed, and distance are related, so when you know two of the terms, 
you can use one of the following formulas to find the third term.
 
✓ Distance. The formula for distance is d = v × t, where v is the veloc-
ity and t is time. When you know velocity and time, you can calculate 
 distance.
 
✓ Speed. The formula for speed is
 
 where d is the distance and t is time. When you know distance and time, 
you can calculate velocity (speed).
 
✓ Time. The formula for time is:
 
 where d is the distance and v is velocity. When you know distance and 
velocity, you can calculate time.
Volts, Amps, and Watts
Volts, amps (amperes), and watts are related terms used by electricians. In 
a typical office or home, if you plug in too many computers, space heaters, 
power tools, irons, or other appliances into outlets on the same circuit, a 
breaker trips as a safety precaution.
Volts, amps, and watts are related. When you know two of the three terms, 
you can use one of the following formulas to find the third:
 
✓ Watts: The formula for wattage is w = a × v (watts = amps × volts), where 
a is the amperage and v is the voltage.
 
 Multiply a circuit breaker’s amps (typically 20 amps) by the power com-
pany’s voltage (typically 120 volts) to get the number of watts the circuit 

323
 Chapter 21: Ten Formulas You’ll Use Most Often
can carry. For the circuit described here, the maximum wattage is about 
2,400 watts.
 
✓ Amps: The formula for amperage is
 
 where w is the wattage and v is the voltage.
 
 Divide the wattage on a circuit (the sum of the wattages of all lights, 
appliances, heaters, tools, and so on connected to that circuit) by the 
voltage. The result is the number of amps the circuit is drawing. If the 
amount of amps drawn is greater than the circuit’s rating, the breaker 
should trip any second now. Keep a flashlight handy.
 
✓ Volts: The formula for voltage is
 
 where w is the wattage and a is the amperage.
 
 The best way to measure voltage is with a voltmeter. With voltage, even 
the professional electrician may get an occasional surprise (but hope-
fully not a shock). We know of one situation where a normal 120-volt cir-
cuit was wired for 240 volts. That’s dangerous — it can cause fire, injury 
or death.

Ten Ways to Avoid Everyday 
Math Stress
In This Chapter
▶ Beefing up your math skills in everyday settings
▶ Practicing math without the pressure
You may think you can’t master math, but the prospects are good that 
you can. The keys to doing so are knowing the principles and practicing 
them. This chapter has 10 easy tips for getting better at math.
If you have trouble doing simple math (such as adding, subtracting, and multi-
plying), you may have a little anxiety. If you avoid math problems and mathema-
ticians, you may even have a little fear of math (math phobia). See Chapter 2 for 
more on math phobia.
Remember: We authors aren’t doctors, nor do we play them on TV, so you 
should seek medical help if you have a serious learning problem. But for ordi-
nary math stress, the cure is right here. Take two of these tips and call us in 
the morning. Take all ten and see whether you don’t do better at math. If your 
improvement persists for more than 30 years, please call us to let us know!
Get Help with Your Checkbook
Balancing a checkbook improves your addition and subtraction skills. At 
one time or another, everyone has trouble balancing a checkbook. If you get 
stuck, get someone to help you (as long as you don’t care whether they know 
about your finances) or try these techniques:
 
✓ Keep your check register complete and up to date. Always bring down 
the balance. Subtract checks and add deposits.
 
✓ When your statement arrives, check off the cleared items on the state-
ment and in the register. Draw a little circle next to uncleared items. 

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Draw a line in the register under the last cleared item shown on the bank 
statement. That’s the date you need to reconcile to.
 
✓ On the back of the statement, write the bank’s ending balance. In a 
column underneath it, write the uncleared items from your register. 
Subtract the uncleared checks from the balance and add uncleared 
deposits to the balance.
 
✓ On the back of the statement, write your register’s ending balance (where 
you put the underline). In a column underneath it, write any charges or 
interest from the bank statement. Add interest. Subtract charges.
 
 The sums of the two columns should be equal. If they’re not, you’re 
going to have to check things further. You may have failed to record a 
check or a deposit.
 
✓ After reconciling, be sure to write any new bank charges, interest or 
adjustments in the register.
Use Grocery Shopping to Build 
Confidence
Estimating groceries improves your estimating skills, rounding skills, and your 
capacity to do math in your head. If you have totally full cart, that can be quite dif-
ficult, but if you’re buying just a few items, build your math skills with these tips:
 
✓ Make a list before you shop. Write the approximate cost of each item 
on the list. If you don’t know the price, estimate based on your past 
experience. If a head of lettuce cost $1.00 last week, it shouldn’t have 
risen to $1.50 this week (you hope).
 
✓ Go to the grocery store with one bill (say a ten-dollar bill) in your 
pocket and try not to spend any more than that. If you buy more than 
ten dollars’ worth of stuff, you find out pretty quickly at the checkout. 
This experience will make you a better estimator.
 
✓ As you put items in your cart, round the prices. Always round up. 
Think of an $0.89 can of beans as costing $1.00 — rounding helps 
account for sales tax. Check out Chapter 9 for info on rounding.
 
✓ Rely on experience with items you buy every week. For example, if 
a 1.25 liter bottle of your favorite sparkling mineral water is never higher 
than $1.35, you can be pretty sure that two bottles will always cost less 
than $3.00 and four bottles cost less than $6.00.
 
✓ Keep track of your estimate as your cart fills up. Otherwise, you’re 
likely to forget the estimated amount.
 
✓ Count the items in your cart. That’s simple, and the tally also tells you 
whether to get in the express checkout line.

Practice Reading Analog Clocks
Sure, it’s not as easy as glancing at your computer’s digital clock, but reading 
analog clocks (those with hands and a 12-hour face) improves your estimat-
ing and your capacity to do math in your head. Here are a couple of ideas for 
getting comfortable with analog clocks:
 
✓ Work with analog clocks to get better at reading and estimating 
time. Become a clock watcher. Practice, and count the minute marks if 
necessary. Go up to the clock face and say the time and the duration 
you’re measuring. For example, at 10:10 a.m., say “It’s now 10:10. When 
Mickey’s big hand moves ten marks, it’ll be 10:20.”
 
✓ Develop a sense of when the clock shows the passage of 15 minutes 
(a quarter of an hour) and 30 minutes (a half hour). Those are simple, 
common time periods that can help you better estimate how long you 
have until a deadline and so on.
 
The first Mickey Mouse watch appeared in 1933, and you can still buy them 
today. The Ingersoll-Waterbury Watch Company first produced it, selling 
over 11,000 the first day. It saved the company from bankruptcy.
Play Games
Playing games improves strategy, conceptual, counting, and addition skills. 
Do you have trouble keeping score during games or remembering how to 
keep score? The keys to improvement are to recognize the scoring pattern 
and to practice, practice, practice. Just think of scoring as mostly counting 
with a little addition thrown in. Check out these pointers for playing your way 
to better math skills:
 
✓ Start by playing games with simple scoring. In many games, your score 
goes up by one when you win a point, and your opponent’s score goes 
up by one when he wins a point. It’s simple counting. If you can’t remem-
ber the score, just write it down.
 
✓ Play computer games. Many games keep the score for you, but they also 
teach problem-solving strategies. Try hidden object games, where you 
try to find many items camouflaged in a scene — these games help your 
perception, which is valuable in dissecting story problems or figuring 
out which formulas to apply. If you play games on the computer at work, 
just tell your boss that you’re building your math skills (though that may 
or may not get you off the hook).

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ For a bigger challenge, practice scoring for games or sports like 
tennis, bowling, poker, cribbage, or bridge. Games like these have 
special scores and odd patterns that can help you build more advanced 
skills. Bridge, for example, is almost incomprehensible, with points for 
each trick (depending on suit), overtricks, undertricks, slam bonus, 
honors, game, rubber, and whether you’re vulnerable or not.
Memorize Math Signs, Symbols, 
and Formulas
If you think you can’t remember mathematical concepts, rules, or formulas, 
don’t feel bad. You remember the concepts you use most often — we bet 
you’ve memorized your phone number and know what a dollar sign ($), stop 
sign, and so on are — so focus on remembering the math you use all the time.
Remember, the signs for arithmetic are +, −, ×, and ÷. They represent addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively, and come up 
in pretty much every career, so you want to know them to avoid confusing 
yourself and others on the job. On the other hand, signs like the square root 
sign (√) rarely come up in your work, so you don’t need to devote as much 
attention and memory to them.
The same idea applies to formulas. For example, if you calculate a lot of 
areas, you know in your heart-of-hearts that the area of a rectangle is the 
product of the length and the width (A = L × W).
 
If other formulas come up in your work, you don’t necessarily have to memo-
rize them. Use common sense. Just write them down and be prepared to look 
them up in your manual notes, on your computer, or on the Internet.
Make the Multiplication Table a Mantra
You can do math faster in your head when you know the multiplication table, 
but lots of people have trouble with multiplication tables. In Chapter 5, we 
offer a 9 x 9 version of the table showing the result of multiply numbers 
from 1 through 9 by numbers from 1 through 9. It also includes multiplication 
by 0. If you have trouble multiplying, make a copy of that table and say the 
products few times: “2 times 3 equals 6,” “2 times 4 equals 8,” and so forth. 
This strategy is rote learning, and it works amazingly well.

329
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Avoid Everyday Math Stress
Make the multiplication table your mantra. (A mantra is a word, phrase, 
syllable, or sound that you methodically repeat many times.) Say the table 
softly or say it loudly, but say it often. Reciting a multiplication table is easier 
than practicing violin. You can recite the table while you’re jogging or doing 
dishes; you can’t practice violin when you’re doing those tasks.
Use Paper Maps and Practice Navigating
Do you have trouble differentiating between left and right? The condition 
seems to be growing more common as everyone gets more stressed by 
everyday life. If left and right are a problem for you (and even if they aren’t), 
you may also have trouble reading a map — many people do. A map is just 
a paper picture of geography (the city of Denver, for example) on a plane 
surface. It’s a simple case of geometry. A map also has a scale, a legend, sym-
bols, and colors. Why, those very terms come up in Chapter 17, the chapter 
about graphs, and you can use them in map reading.
Getting from here to there on a map isn’t difficult. Just remember the following:
 
✓ Hold the map so you can read it. For most roadmaps, that means north 
is at the top.
 
✓ Find where you are and where you want to go, and then use a high-
lighter to mark the route.
 
✓ If you want, use the scale to get an idea of the mileage between vari-
ous points on the route. The sum of the mileages gives you the total 
mileage to your destination (and puts your adding skills to use).
 
✓ Practice by using a map often, even to get to places you already know.
Try to Estimate Distances
You may have trouble estimating measurements or distance. Why? Because 
just about everyone has trouble estimating measurements or distance. It’s 
not easy to estimate 100 yards or even 10 feet! Try it. Take a tape measure, go 
outdoors, and estimate a distance. Then measure the actual distance with the 
tape. Your estimate probably isn’t even close. It takes lots of practice to get 
good at estimating distances.
Even small measurements can be a challenge. Ask someone to hold her 
hands 1 foot apart. Then measure the distance with a ruler. Usually, the 
person’s estimate is 2 to 4 inches off. Estimating a yard is even harder.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Use a shortcut. A cubit (about 18 inches) is the distance from your elbow to 
the extended tip of your middle finger. A yard is the distance from your nose 
to the extended tip of your middle finger. You can use your body as a mea-
surement system. For more information, just perform a quick Web search for 
“your body ruler.”
Take Up Music
Some people have trouble with sequential processing, the ability to register, 
collect, process, and use information in an organized way. This problem can 
affect both abstract tasks (for example, reading, writing, and math) and phys-
ical tasks such as doing dance steps.
Research suggests that people are involved with music do better at math. 
Dancing is a good way to get involved, and dance steps usually require execu-
tion in a pre-determined sequence. So, dancing is a great way to get a grip 
on sequential processing (which you use in virtually all math problems) Try 
salsa, line dancing, contra dancing, or square dancing. Learn the Texas Two-
Step and Cotton-Eyed Joe. They’re all fun.
If you’re absolutely dance challenged, get a copy of the song “This Old Man” 
(a traditional children’s marching song) and sing it:
This old man, he played one,
He played knick-knack on my thumb;
Knick-knack paddywhack,
Give a dog a bone,
This old man came rolling home.
This old man, he played two,
He played knick-knack on my shoe;
Knick-knack paddywhack,
Give a dog a bone,
This old man came rolling home.
This old man, he played three,
He played knick-knack on my knee;
(Etc.)
This old man, he played four,
He played knick-knack on my door;
(Etc.)
Notice that this old tune has a sequence built right in to it.

Integrate Math with Nonmath Skills
If you’re in school, you probably do better in some subjects than in others. 
Think about the subjects you like and use them to build math skills.
Find the parts of your nonmath courses that require a little math. Then per-
form (don’t avoid) the math. Try making anything into a little math exercise 
(for example, sequencing history dates or counting chapters). This strategy 
is a painless way to build your math skills. As Mary Poppins says, “A spoonful 
of sugar helps the medicine go down.”
Even if they’re not your favorites, look at subjects that emphasize thinking 
and logic; they may also offer opportunities to practice math. The more you 
integrate your math skills with your nonmath skills, the easier math becomes.
