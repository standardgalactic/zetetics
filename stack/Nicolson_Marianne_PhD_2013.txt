Kwak’wala is an endangered language spoken by the Kwakwaka’wakw First Nations of the 
central coast of British Columbia.  This dissertation seeks to address the ramifications of 
Kwak’wala language loss to Kwakwaka’wakw cultural worldview.   It asks the general question, 
“How much of an effect does Kwak’wala language loss have on cultural understanding?”  It 
seeks to answer the question through a specific analysis of the concept of space mapped 
through linguistic and artistic expression.  The concept of space is integral to the understanding 
of the body in relationship to objects, people, social structure and geographic conceptualization. 
Through linguistic morphological analysis a corpus of approximately 600 word and phrase 
examples drawn from the linguistic documentation of Franz Boas and George Hunt, David 
Grubb, the website First Voices and contemporary Kwak’wala speakers was analyzed for 
semantic content (meaning). The content (meanings of words and phrases) was then 
contextualized into broader cultural expressions and beliefs through prototype theory, radial 

iv 
 
 
categorization, metaphor and analogy. The dissertation then explores the connections between 
“linguistic” spatial expression represented through words and speech with what can be 
considered as “non-linguistic” cultural expressions such as architecture, social structure, 
performance and visual art.  Four major visual works were created that sought to express 
aspects of the spatial concepts that were emerging from the Kwak’wala linguistic study.  
Ultimately, the research reveals a strong spatial mapping process between the human body, the 
architecture of “the house” and the landscape traditionally occupied by the Kwakwaka’wakw 
which results in a metaphorical conceptualization of Body=House=Land/World which can be 
said to exist in Kwak’wala language forms and translates as highly productive in cultural 
manifestations.   With the replacement of Kwak’wala by English the strength of this metaphor is 
weakened but not eradicated within Kwakwaka’wakw cultural expression.

Dream of Ha’etła’las 
I dreamed last night of a pretty woman who came to call me to pick cranberries.  
We went inland.  Then we saw many cranberries and blueberry bushes which were 
hanging down with many blueberries hanging from the points (of the branches) and 
so we shook them into our berry picking baskets.  Then our berry picking baskets 
were full.  I awoke after that.  Then Ha’etła’las knew that she was going to keep 
alive until the season of cranberry picking (Boas, 1925, p. 7). 
 
1.1 
Problem statement 
Kwak’wala, the language spoken by the Kwakwaka’wakw First Nations is endangered as a 
living language.   The Kwakwaka’wakw First Nations are comprised of approximately 17 tribes 
who share a common language and culture (Jonaitis, 1991).   They occupy the northeastern 
portion of Vancouver Island and the adjacent mainland coast of British Columbia, Canada.   
Formerly known within Anthropology as the Kwakiutl, the Kwakwaka’wakw self- identify as “The 

2 
 
 
Kwak’wala speaking peoples.1” (Galois, 1994).  Kwak’wala is linguistically delineated as a 
Wakashan language.  As such it shares both linguistic characteristics and coastal geographic 
affiliation with six other tribal groups; the Haisla, the Heiltsuk, the Awikinuxw, the Makah, the 
Nitinaht and the Nuu-chah-nuth (Lincoln & Rath, 1980; Grubb 1969).    In contemporary times 
the Kwak’wala language is now endangered due to massive population decline through 
introduced disease, colonial oppression and the historic assimilationist policies of the Canadian 
Government carried out over the last 160 years (Anonby, 1997; Boyd, 1999; Duff, 1997; Ray, 
2010).   How much longer the Kwakwaka’wakw can remain Kwakwaka’wakw, “the Kwak’wala 
speaking peoples” by definition is a difficult and awkward question.  Of approximately 5000 
members only approximately 150 speakers remain2 (Anthony, Davis & Powell, 2003).  Without 
extreme effort the Kwak’wala language may become a dormant language within 20 years as 
most speakers are elderly and the younger generations do not speak the language.   Over the 
past 40 years while the Kwak’wala language was decreasing in use, a marked resurgence in 
                                                 
1 The term “Kwakwaka’wakw is problematic in that it has a changing application in relation to demographics 
in the last 100 years.  Originally cited within Boas’ early works, the term specifically referred to the 
confederation of Kwag’uł tribes living outside of Fort Rupert from approximately 1850-1910.  In the 1970’s 
it was revived as a term meant to encompass all Kwakwala speaking tribes including those tribes who 
identified with the separate dialects of ‘Nakwala, Guťsala, `Tłaťłasiḱwala and Liḱwala.  There has been 
recent discussion as to the appropriate application of this term but in relationship to the time within which 
this thesis is written I will continue to use it within its contemporary definition which is inclusive of all the 
tribes speaking dialects of the Kwak’wala language. 
2First People’s Heritage, Language and Culture Council’s 2010 Report on the Status of B.C. First Nations 
Languages gives a speaker count of 148 on p. 23.  http://fpcc.ca/language/status-report/

Kwakwaka’wakw cultural practice emerged encouraged both by tourism and a more positive 
identification with Aboriginal heritage. 
  
Kwak’wala speaking elders have voiced the opinion that without proficiency in the Kwak’wala 
language mono-lingual English speaking Kwakwaka’wakw will have difficulty understanding and 
manifesting traditional Kwakwaka’wakw culture.   While it is necessary to acknowledge that all 
traditions are part of a continuum of cultural adaptation, some gradual while others sudden, the 
issue of language loss amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw is specific in the context of having 
undergone a sharply delineated cultural shift under colonization.  This shift has been defined by 
a rapid degeneration of Kwak’wala language use within 2-3 generations.   
 
This thesis seeks to address the ramifications of Kwak’wala language loss to Kwakwaka’wakw 
cultural worldview.   It asks the general question, “How much of an effect does Kwak’wala 
language loss have on cultural understanding?”, and seeks to answer the question through a 
specific analysis of the concept of space mapped through linguistic and artistic expression.

1.2      Research objective  
In order to better understand the implications of Indigenous language loss this research 
focuses on the relationship of language to culture.  The debate over whether language 
influences culture or vice-versa, within linguistics goes back several decades, perhaps even 

5 
 
 
the entire 20th Century (Sapir, 1921; Whorf, 1956; Chomsky, 1965, 1966, 2006; Lakoff & 
Johnson, 1999).  In this debate, during the early decades of the 20th Century Franz Boas 
(1858-1942), source of the majority of archival material in Kwak’wala, believed that language 
and culture was a component of a whole working system that could only be understood within 
the context of all its parts (Boas, 1966).  Due to his belief in the cultural connection to language 
he committed much effort to collecting and publishing remarkable amounts of cultural 
information in the Kwak’wala language, with English translation.  A student of Boas, Edward 
Sapir (1884-1939) along with Benjamin Whorf (1897-1941) contributed to the discussion of the 
relationship between language and culture in what has come to be termed the Whorf-
hypothesis or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Thomson, 2000; Swoyer 2003) or, more recently, 
the linguistic relativity hypothesis (Gumperz & Levinson, 1991).   The hypothesis proposes that 
“the semantic structures of different languages might be incommensurable, with consequences 
for the way in which speakers of different languages might think and act.  On this view, 
language, thought and culture are deeply interlocked, so that each language might be claimed 
to have associated with it a distinctive worldview” (Gumperz, p.614).   On the other end of the 
debate, during the 1960s, the famous linguist, Noam Chomsky (1928-) was a major agent in 
the development of a linguistic theory of innate universal language structures that underlay all 

6 
 
 
languages.  Referred to as universal grammar  the theory was that humans had an innate 
capacity for language and that this capacity is little influenced by environment (Chomsky, 
1965).   Linguistic rules could generate formally correct speech much like a computer could 
generate data based on proper inputs.  Linguistic difference was considered to be topical or 
surface oriented and the deeper structures of language considered as basically similar or 
“universal”. This universalism would espouse that different languages are fundamentally 
similar and that they are grounded in human biology not human environment; a nature vs. 
nurture argument.   This debate has been publicly, and at times contentiously battled between 
Chomsky and the proponents of cognitive linguistics, popularly associated with the linguistic 
scholar George Lakoff (Harris, 1993).   
 
My research seeks to explore the connections between “linguistic” expression and what can be 
considered as “non-linguistic” cultural expressions such as architecture, social structure, 
performance, narratives (story-telling) and visual art.  Are these alternative forms of cultural 
expression complementary to the Kwak’wala language or arbitrary?  If they are found to be 
complementary then we can consider that they share underlying conceptual features therefore 
making the connection between language and culture stronger.  If they are found to be 

7 
 
 
arbitrary or only weakly connected then the relationship between language and culture can be 
considered more topical.  The end result is the examiniation of how connected the concepts of 
space and time, as expressed in the Kwak’wala language are, with non-linguistic culturally 
based expressions.  
  
I have chosen to explore the primary domain of space and its complement time.  This research 
is an extension of my initial exploration of the conceptualization of time in my Master’s thesis 
(Nicolson, 2005).  Space is the primary topic because time seems to take its conceptualization 
from space.   Space and time concepts, while universal in their presence across cultures, can 
vary in their expression and manifestation.  They also form the foundation for many other 
concepts.   All cultures engage with the concept of space.  An understanding of space is 
required in architecture (around, above, below), the hierarchies of social structure (above, 
below, on par), ritual and performance (the body on stage) and art (shape and form).   Spatial 
engagement operates as universal phenomenon across cultures.   Space is analyzed as a 
universal concept where comparison between the very different languages of English and 
Kwak’wala can render an understanding of variance in expression and conceptualization.

1.3    Central thesis 
The linguistic research conducted over the course of this thesis reveals a strong spatial 
mapping process between the human body, the architecture of “the house” and the landscape 
traditionally occupied by the Kwakwaka’wakw which results in a metaphorical 
conceptualization which is highly productive in cultural manifestations.  This spatial mapping 
emerges strongly in both linguistic forms (words) and semantic expressions such as contained 
in speeches and narratives.  The spatial mapping process appears to have a heavy influence 
on the perception of the body in space in relationship to subjects and objects, the relationship 
of the body both inside and outside of architectural forms, the composition of architectural 
forms themselves and ultimately in how the body is situated within, and then navigates the 
landscape.  The concept of the self in relationship to others, social structure, ceremonial 
choreography and the formal execution of art-forms such as masks and regalia reflects an 
analogous approach to the concept of space as BODY=HOUSE=LAND.  This general premise 
then provides the basis for a particular and rich metaphorical expression that is found to be 
present not just in language but is also manifest in other cultural expressions and ultimately is 
able be translated into an engagement with modern, non-traditional spaces.

1.4    Thesis outline 
My research is concerned with the relationship of “form” and “meaning’” in language and 
culture.   It is interdisciplinary in nature and engages with linguistics, anthropology and visual 
art.   The thesis is composed into two components; first, a written component which explains 
the research findings regarding Kwakwaka’wakw space as it emerges through the Kwak’wala 
language and second, a visual art component which explores the research findings in “real” 
space.  Chapter 1 is a general introduction.  Chapter 2 deals with the primary theoretical 
frameworks within which this research is situated; Linguistics, Anthropology, and Visual Art 
and the methods applied to reach conclusions.   Linguistics is the scientific study of language.  
Anthropology is defined by the American Anthropological Association as “the study of humans 
past and present”.  One could generally say Anthropology is the study of culture.  Initially 
linguistics fell under the discipline of anthropology until the mid-Twentieth Century when it 
broke off and attained its own status as an independent discipline and as a result there is 
heavy cross-over in sub-disciplines.  Anthropological linguistics is one sub-discipline of 
Anthropology.  What Linguistics and Anthropology share as disciplines is the investment in the 
ultimate decipherment of “meaning.”   Visual art is one discipline that falls under the variety of 
human expressions considered to be the “Fine Arts” in academics.  The visual arts can be said 

10 
 
 
to be heavily invested in the visual experience of human perception as opposed to other 
faculties such as music and dance.  However, the division of these sub-disciplines under the 
umbrella of fine arts has become increasingly blurred as visual art has become increasingly 
engaged with interdisciplinary crossover.   Visual art and art in general are also heavily 
concerned with issues of “meaning.”   Chapter 3 presents the Kwak’wala u-[a’w-] stem and its 
relationship to the body, the house and the land.  Chapters 4 thru 6 deal with a linguistic 
analysis of spatial terminology in relationship with the body, which then moves outwards.  
Chapter 4 deals with personal space  (the body).  Chapter 5 deals with architectural space (the 
house), while chapter 6 deals with geographic space (the land).   Each topic is explored 
through a linguistic analysis of the language forms used to express these ideas.  This linguistic 
analysis is then compared to non-linguistic cultural expressions such as narrative, architecture, 
and ritual for consistencies in the construction of meaning.      Chapter 7 explores conceptual 
spatial/temporal crossover. Chapter 8 gives a description and analysis of the visual component 
of the thesis.  This component is considered a conceptual experiment in the relationship of 
“form” and “meaning”.  It involves the creation of a series of works which seek to address the 
spatial and cultural concepts which emerge from the linguistic and anthropological comparison.  
Can a non-linguistic expression such as visual art as visual signifier (or visual language) take 

11 
 
 
the place of language as oral or written signifiers and still consistently express the same 
underlying conceptualizations of meaning in space?   Chapter 9 concludes this thesis and 
provides an overall evaluation of the research presented. 
 
1.5      Background of the author 
I am in a particular position to conduct this research as a member of the Kwakwaka’wakw, my 
maternal grandparents coming from the Dzawada’enuxw of Gwa’yi (Kingcome Inlet), the 
Haxwa’mis of Ałałxu (Wakeman Sound), the Kwikwasuťinuxw of Gwayasdams (Gilford Island) 
and the Kwagu’ł of `Tsaxis (Fort Rupert).   I grew up both on and off reserve, while developing 
an avid interest and engagement in traditional culture.   An artist by training in both traditional 
Kwakwaka’wakw visual forms as well as Western based art practice, I have an extensive history 
of working in both traditional community based contexts and public museum and gallery 
exhibits; local, national and international.  In many ways my artistic inquiry initially framed this 
academic research.  I have spent much time considering the challenges posed in language and 
cultural revitalization for First Nations in Canada as well as the cross-over of cultural forms from 
their original traditional intent and their assimilation and appropriation into colonial systems.   
This being said, my particular background renders simultaneously both the opportunity to be an 

12 
 
 
insider with privileged knowledge built up over a lengthy period of time but also an additional 
impediment to objectivity.  It was as a survivalist strategy that I chose to pursue academic 
contexts to supplement traditional Kwakwaka’wakw knowledge which, through colonization, I 
had inherited as fragmented and conflicted.   Colonization is a concept I feel is important to 
remain highly conscious of as both the Kwak’wala language and Kwakwaka’wakw culture have 
been affected by it.   As an act of outside aggression to take over lands and resources which 
included the subjection and oppression of indigenous cultures, colonization for the 
Kwakwaka’wakw came with contact with European colonists who have systematically attempted 
to take over their lands and cultures within the relatively short time frame of a few hundred  
years (since 1792) and remains an ongoing process.   It is important to acknowledge that the 
language and cultural forms I am engaged with are not static, historical and frozen in time but 
dynamic, ongoing and vital.  They exist within changing contexts and relationships both internal 
to the Kwakwaka’wakw and external to the broader Canadian state.   Colonialism has had a 
large influence in this. 
 
Throughout the 1990s, it was communicated to me personally by Kwak’wala speaking elders, 
that without an understanding of the Kwak’wala language, I would have difficulty truly 

13 
 
 
comprehending Kwakwaka’wakw cultural forms.   This dissertation is the result of trying to 
answer my own reflexive question “Why?” as well as learn the language by being able to study it 
under a structured setting all the while considering whether a greater faculty with the Kwak’wala 
language could have an impact on my artistic expression.  My own personal objectives within 
this research are twofold; one, to help facilitate the creation of a younger generation speaker in 
myself, by providing structured study, and two, to provide information for other Kwakwaka’wakw 
that may be useful in Kwak’wala language acquisition.   Under this premise I have been careful 
to avoid overly-specialized technical language as much as possible particularly when it comes 
to linguistics which can be so heavily laden with technical language that the information is 
obscure except to others within the discipline.   While I acknowledge the value and necessity of 
academic peer review and intellectual discourse my primary audience while researching and 
writing has been my own community while generating an understanding of the complex 
relationship of language to culture.   While this research project remains highly aware of the 
endangered nature of Kwak’wala it also explores the broader questions of language use and 
effect on worldview and the question “Why is it important to save this language?”. As such, this 
thesis and the artworks that accompany it are attempts at decolonization and arise from a belief 
in voicing indigenous ideas on all available platforms.  Within the very real possibility of 

14 
 
 
Kwak’wala language loss and Kwakwaka’wakw cultural assimilation my belief is that as long as 
we continue to speak then we will continue to exist.  For me personally, this means speaking the 
Kwak’wala language and articulating our customs, beliefs and traditions in contexts academic, 
or artistic, in private, or in public.

Chapter 2: Form and Meaning: 
Theoretical Frameworks & Methodology 
 
 
Dream of ‘Naxnagam 
I dreamed I was going to the house of the master of the Salmon on the sea side of 
our world.  I don’t know why I was going there.  There I saw my late father.  Then 
he scolded me because I had gone to the place where he was.  He asked me to go 
back home.  Then I remembered that my late father had died long ago.  Then I 
went home.  Then I awoke. (Boas, 1925, p. 49) 
 
2.1  Form and meaning 
This thesis, at its most fundamental level, is concerned with the relationship of form and 
meaning.  If there is a radical change of form how does it affect meaning, or the opposite, how 
does a change in meaning affect form?   Specifically, if a language, as a formal expression of 
a people is radically changed how does that affect the conceptualization of cultural 
understanding?   Form is “what is” while “meaning” has a more ephemeral interpretation as 
“what the form signifies”.   In considering “form” specifically, I am attempting to gauge the 

16 
 
 
relationship between the physical characteristics (sounds which result in words) of the 
Kwak’wala language with Kwakwaka’wakw cultural forms manifest as architecture, social 
structure and art. I then pair these physical forms with their conceptual meanings to see if 
there is a shared understructure which influences the resulting forms.  By ‘understructure’ I 
mean primarily, the belief systems and analogical connections which influence rules of 
grammar (in linguistics) or ‘proper’ form (in architecture, social structure, artistic expression 
and geographic relationships).  This will be mapped out more explicitly through the thesis. The 
hypothesis is that the more evidence that exists of a shared conceptual understructure the 
more likely it can be asserted that language and culture are intrinsically linked, and that 
significant changes in one domain will affect the other.  In other words, a significant change in 
language will significantly affect cultural understanding and vice-versa if they share conceptual 
understructure.  I then attempt to incorporate the spatial (space)/temporal (time) concepts that 
emerge from the analysis of the Kwak’wala language and traditional Kwakwaka’wakw cultural 
expressions into contemporary artworks.  
 
In many ways this reflects on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure (1959), (1857-1913) where 
he posited that language is a system of signs, the signifier (form) and the signified (meaning). 

17 
 
 
“Sounds, images, written words, paintings, photographs, etc. function as signs within 
language” when they serve to express or communicate ideas.” (Hall, 1997).  Saussure then 
went on to divide the “sign” in to the “signifier” and the “signified”.  The “signifier” he equated 
with form (words, images etc.) and the “signified” was equated with the idea or concept.  He 
indicated it was the relationship between them that created meaning. (p. 31).  Figure 2.1 is a 
diagram of the relationship between form and meaning with form taking the upper position as 
the surface manifestation of underlying conceptual meanings.

The sign as an expression of communication exists as two components.  The first component 
is the obvious one, the one that exists in the world.  A linguistic example is a noun such as dog 
which refers to a type of animal.  On the surface level of conceptualization one could say that 
the meaning of the word dog, as a type of animal can be translated into Kwak’wala as waťsi  “a 
dog”.  The words dog and ‘waťsi are signifiers.  However, at the deeper conceptual levels of 
belief and cultural association the “meaning” of the Kwak’wala word ‘waťsi and the English 
word dog differ.  In Kwakwaka’wakw belief systems ‘waťsi  are accorded an intermediate 
status as both associated with wolves and yet living companions to humans who assist them in 
certain tasks, and as such are to be respected.  For example, there were inherited house 
names for dogs such as `Patłalagila, for the Dłidłagidi ‘naḿima (house clan) of the Kwagu’ł 
(Boas 1921, p. 801).  The ‘waťsamł  “dog mask” is used in a high ranking dance amongst the 
Dzawada’enuxw tribe.  We also have names such as ‘Waťs’pala “smells like a dog3” and 
‘Wayoł “old dog4” which in English translation sound derogatory but according to my uncle, 
Ernest Peter Willie, were honorable names. (family recording). Dzawada’enuxw histories tell of 
the gift of a supernatural dog from Tawixa’xta’ to an early ancestor `Kalaḿin who helped catch 
mountain goats (Boas 1902, p. 37).  The name `Was’wasaliga’e is given with the “dog dance”

to ‘Nalbe’, the son of `Tsekame, the original ancestor of the Kwikwasuťinuxw (Boas 1902, p 
191).   From these examples one can see that while the words dog and ‘waťsi  as linguistic 
symbols share a reference to a certain type of animal they differ in their underlying 
associations and extended meaning.  According the Saussure, the sign has a symbol which 
exists in the world and a meaning which is defined by a relationship to conceptual 
understructure defined by particular beliefs and associations, as in Figure 2.2.

2.1.1  What is form? : What is meaning? 
The words “form” and “meaning” have their own specific interpretations under the disciplines of 
linguistics, anthropology, and visual arts, but they all share some fundamental features.  In 
general, “form” can be defined as the physical configuration of some type of object in the 
world.  In linguistics form is “anything that has a physical shape, be that in terms of sound 
waves or written characters. ”(Bauer, 2004, p. 45)  We can say words are a “formal” aspect of 
language as words are made up of sounds and letters which create speech.  In anthropology 
“form” can be defined as material evidence, or the manifestation of expression into physical 
mediums like architecture (buildings in space), choreography (movement in space) and art 
(objects in space).   Visual art defines form as “what the work is”, in other words its 
compositional features such as color, mass, shape, material etc.  What joins these definitions 
of “form” across disciplines is a relationship to physicality in the world either as sounds, 
movement through space, or as objects. They are the signifiers of their disciplines and are 
manifest on the surface as speech, action and creations. 
 
In general “meaning” can be defined as “the signification of a message” (Chrystal,1999).  In 
linguistics, meaning is considered to be the content of the linguistic form.  For instance, the 

21 
 
 
word child  can be associated with the meaning “a person who has not reached adulthood”.   
Similar to the example dog used in Figure 2.2, different cultures while sharing certain features 
of meaning will have varied associations dependant on cultural factors.  In Kwak’wala there 
are two words that can mean child.  The word gananam means “a generic child” which can be 
contrasted against the word xwanukw  “one’s own child” or sasam meaning “one’s own 
children”. I suspect this distinction exists due to the Kwakwaka’wakw cultural emphasis on 
ancestor and descendant relationships.  In anthropology, meaning is derived from a number of 
contributing cultural factors such as belief systems, history and environment.  Roland Barthes 
(1972) theorized that meaning could be ascribed to a signifier on two levels, the first at the 
level of denotation, or the most basic descriptive level and second, on the level of connotation, 
which ascribes to a signifier wider, broader based meanings.  On the second level signifiers 
are assigned meaning “in terms of the wider realms of social ideology – the general beliefs, 
conceptual frameworks and value systems” of a given society (Hall, 1997, p. 38-39).  In this 
thesis this could be mapped to the terms surface understructure as denotation and deeper 
understructure as connotation.  
 
 

22 
 
 
2.1.2  Semiotics in Anthropology and Visual Art 
The extension of the “sign” from a purely linguistic approach to a broader cultural application 
led to the engagement of semiotics in anthropology and visual arts. 
 
Semiotics: the study of signs and their use, focusing on the mechanisms and 
patterns of human communication and on the nature and acquisition of knowledge.  
Language is viewed in semiotics as one type of sign system, along with other 
systems as bodily gestures, clothing, and the arts” (Chrystal, 1999, p. 302) 
  
Semiotics by analogy extends the notion of what a “language” is to other forms of human 
expression that communicate ideas such as narrative, music, and art.  Under semiotics each 
medium of expression can be said to have a “language” and as such will have surface 
representations and rules and common understandings that support those surface 
representations to create meaning.   
 
In visual art meaning is ascribed by cultural understructures which inform the surface 
representations of form.  “In the semiotic approach, not only words and images, but objects 

23 
 
 
themselves can function as signifiers in the production of meaning” (Hall, 1997, p. 37).  “The 
semiotic approach provides a method for analysing how visual representations convey 
meaning” (p. 41). This means we can consider architecture, material culture such as masks 
and regalia, and the ceremonial compositions of the Kwakwaka’wakw as forms of culture 
whose meanings are derived from hypothetically shared conceptual under-structures. With a 
working knowledge of the conceptual understructures is it possible for novel forms to be 
created that still maintain fundamental connections to traditional meaning?  It is under this 
inquiry that an attempt at a contemporary visual art translation is attempted and included as a 
component of research.  
  
2.2    Written (literal) component of the thesis 
There are two main methods that result in the two major components of this thesis.  The first 
one is the written component which is compiled from research with text based information 
combined with participant interviews.   The second component is the production of a body of 
visual works which attempt to translate Kwakwaka’wakw concepts of space and time into 
contemporary public art spaces.  The first component is quite standard, the second somewhat 
innovative.   The visual component arises out of a questioning of the privileging of literacy as 

24 
 
 
the most appropriate form of knowledge.  Coming from a non-literate, oral society such as the 
Kwakwaka’wakw historically were, as well as studying a language which had no written form 
until the late 1800s it seemed appropriate to attempt to address the issues in an alternative 
medium to writing.  This also presents the opportunity to test whether concepts which are 
symbolized by words can also be symbolized by other means under alternative circumstances.  
 
2.2.1 Linguistic morphological analysis 
Linguistic morphological analysis is a major component of this thesis.   Morphology can be 
defined as “the correlation of form and meaning within the word” (Bauer, 2004:1).  According to 
(Bybee, 1985) “The study of morphology approaches morphemes as the (minimal) linguistic 
units with semantic content, and studies the relations among them” (p. v).  English words such 
as it, on, car, bike  etc. can exist as single units to express an idea.  Other words such as 
biking are composed of more than one meaningful unit bik(e) + ing [continual action] and are 
constructions of the meanings of its constituent parts.  These word parts are called 
morphemes and are defined within linguistics as “minimal meaningful units”.    
 

25 
 
 
Kwak’wala is an excellent language to explore morphological structure as it is a polysynthetic 
language; where a single word can express the equivalent of a sentance.  An example is 
amłaxdan “I played” which is composed of three morphemes amła (to play) + -xd (past tense) 
+ -an (personal pronoun “I”).  Most Kwak’wala words are composed of a stem/root meaning 
with modifying suffixes, sometimes several.  My research examines meaning in Kwak’wala 
expressions by examining the morphology in words and phrases relating to spatial and 
temporal concepts.  Figure 2.3 shows how a Kwak’wala word is broken into morphemes.

I have used a simplified gloss for linguistic words and phrases.  I wanted the information to be 
useful to a non-linguistic audience.  For this reason, I have limited the gloss to the word or 
phrase as the surface form with the meaning of each morpheme written directly beneath, as in 
Figure 2.3.  What is called the free translation is provided on the side in italics along with the 
source of citation.

            play  was  I 
 
 
 
Where it seemed important to make the differentiation I have separated the morphemes with a 
dash as in the following example: 
 
(#)       amła – xd - an                               “I was playing.” (www.firstvoices.com) 
            play        was     I 
 
In order to generate linguistic data a formal morphological analysis of the Kwak’wala language 
was applied in order to derive the literal meanings of Kwak’wala words relating to spatial and 
temporal expression.  These were then organized into conceptual categories and extensions 
which were then compared with cultural forms and expressions.  Specifically, space and time 

27 
 
 
were analyzed through their manifestation within one component of the Kwak’wala determiner 
system (personal space), cardinal directions (geographic space), the occupation of objects in 
space (categorization), and the use of metaphor.   My research examines how these topics are 
expressed in the Kwak’wala language and then compares how these concepts were mapped 
onto traditional cultural practices as manifested in the early 20th century when Kwak’wala was 
still the dominant language amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw Nations.   
  
2.2.2  Review of Kwak’wala texts and participant interviews 
The major source of Kwak’wala linguistic information, used in this thesis, stems from Franz 
Boas’ extensive work conducted from 1880-1940 (Boas,1911, 1947, 1948).  Both his 1947 
“Glossary of the Suffixes” and his 1948 “Kwakiutl Dictionary” were only made public after his 
death in 1942.  I have cross-referenced the Boas data with David Grubb’s 1977 “Kwakiutl 
Dictionary”, U’mista Cultural Society’s 1981 “Learning Kwak’wala Series” and the web based 
Kwak’wala resources available through the project “First Voices” developed by the First 
People’s Cultural Foundation (http://www.firstvoices.com).  In addition, the accuracy of 
linguistic forms and cultural expressions were reviewed with contemporary Kwak’wala 
speakers through an interview process conducted in person and over the phone.   The 

28 
 
 
interviews in person were audio recorded.  The phone interviews were not audio recorded.  All 
elicited samples were written down in field notebooks.  I elicited Kwak’wala words and 
sentences as well as checked published examples.   I used two consultants.  The first was 
born in 1928 and the second was born in 1937.  Both grew up in Kingcome Inlet, Gilford Island 
and Alert Bay.   Elicited forms were checked with both speakers before being included as 
examples.  I also checked with the informants about general cultural understandings which 
were emerging through the research. 
 
2.2.3  U’mista Orthography 
In this thesis I have chosen to use the U’mista orthography for writing the Kwak’wala words.  
Historically there are several useful orthographies that have been devised for Kwak’wala.  
Since the late 1800s various people have devised orthographies in order to be able to write the 
Kwak’wala language.  George M. Dawson published a Kwak’wala vocabulary in 1887.  Around 
the same time the Reverend Alfred J. Hall (1889), who worked in both `Tsaxis (Fort Rupert) 
and `Yalis (Alert Bay) developed an early grammar which was published by the Transactions 
of the Royal Society of Canada.  After Hall and Dawson came Boas who developed a writing 
system which he refined over the course of his 50 year engagement with the Kwakwaka’wakw.   

29 
 
 
Grubb developed his own writing system in the late 1960’s.  In the 1970s the U’mista Cultural 
Society in Alert Bay developed the U’mista writing system (Galois, 1994).   Most contemporary 
linguistic work on Kwak’wala has been documented in the International Phonetic Alphabet 
(IPA).   For this thesis I have used the U’mista Orthography as it is the predominant 
orthography in use in the territory I come from and least intimidating for basic usage.   Where 
necessary, I have transliterated both Boas’ and Grubbs’ orthographic spelling into U’mista’s.   
For a cross reference of these orthographies see Appendix A. 
 
 
2.2.4  Linguistics contexts: Linguistic Relativity and Cognitive Linguistics 
 
Linguistic Relativity and Cognitive Linguistics are two bodies of thought that have emerged 
from linguistics that have been useful in contextualizing my research.  Linguistic Relativity is  
most often referred to as a hypothesis, while Cognitive Linguistics is a fairly new branch of 
modern linguistics.   Modern linguistics began to take shape in the latter part of the 19th 
Century.   In America, Franz Boas and Edward Sapir (1884-1939) were influential in 
developing methods for documenting the potentially endangered languages of Native 
Americans.  Both Boas and Sapir considered that languages were intrinsically connected to 

30 
 
 
the epistemology, or “way of life and thought of its speakers” (McGregor  2009, p. 9).   Under 
the influence of Boas and Sapir emerged the theory of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, or 
Linguistic Relativity, which is mostly credited to Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1941), who was a 
student of Sapir (Foley, 1997). This theory has been the source of much linguistic speculation.  
In Whorf’s own words: 
 
the “linguistic relativity principle”…means, in informal terms, that users of markedly 
different grammars are pointed by their grammars toward different types of 
observations and different evaluations of externally similar acts of observation, and 
hence are not equivalent as observers but must arrive at somewhat different views 
of the world. (Whorf, 1956, p. 221) 
  
In linguistics, this more contextual, historical approach to language was replaced by an interest 
in Structuralist Linguistics which emerged from the work of Saussure. (McGregor, 2009)  When 
Saussure separated form and meaning into the “signifier” and the signified” it enabled linguists 
to focus more on the formal aspects of language and to treat language more like a science.   
McGregor (2009) calls the perspectives of Boas, Sapir and Whorf “mentalistic’ which I interpret 

31 
 
 
to be conceptual or thought based and invested in “meaning”.  This “mentalistic orientation” 
was rejected by Leonard Bloomfield in his objective to make linguistics a science. (Campbell, 
2003; McGregor, 2009) This is when a particular focus on “form” over “meaning” began to 
emerge within the discipline.   McGregor states the focus on the mechanics of language from 
the 1930s to the 1950s diminished the role of “meaning”.  Linguistic exploration of language 
under formal analysis became highly developed and extra-ordinarily technical in its approach.  
Today the discipline is characterized by two primary divisions, formal linguistics with its 
emphasis on the formal aspects of language and functional linguistics which has reinvested 
itself in context and meaning (Halliday, 2003; McGregor, 2009).  Under functional linguistics 
has emerged the sub-field of cognitive linguistics.   Both linguistic relativity which was 
influenced by the work of Boas and Sapir, and cognitive linguistics are of particular interest to 
this thesis.  The linguistic relativity hypothesis is used to provide academic context to the 
issues.   Metaphor, prototype theory, and radial categories from cognitive linguistics all help 
shape the analytical results of the morphological analysis.  Figure 2.4 diagrams the 
relationships of “form” and “meaning” which is divided into “surface understructure”, which 
could be also called rules for “proper form”, and “deep understructure”.  According to this 
thesis “deep understructure” affects “surface understructure / proper form” which then 

32 
 
 
manifests as “form” in the world.  “Meanings” are produced in the mind while “forms” are 
produced in the world.

2.2.5    Linguistic Relativity 
 
A re-engagement with Linguistic Relativity has been gaining momentum in the movement for 
the revitalization of Aboriginal languages in the last 20 years (Fee, 2003).   Does the language 
one speaks influence the way one sees the world?   This is a question pertinent to Aboriginal 
communities as traditional languages become more and more endangered.  According to 
Battiste & Youngblood Henderson (2000), “Linguist Kenneth Hale has estimated that half the 
world’s 6000 Indigenous languages are doomed because no children speak them…Recent 
studies in Canada show that all fifty-three Indigenous languages are critically endangered” (p. 
82).   In losing languages are we losing just the forms of language or are we also losing 
diverse worldviews?  Whorf (1956) had observed “a new principle of relativity, which holds that 
all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, 
unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated” (p. 214).  In 
this statement Whorf emphasized the relationship between language and worldview.   
According to a Whorfian perspective then, in losing languages we are indeed losing unique 
and valuable ways of perceiving and being in the world. 
  

34 
 
 
A review of the issues from its early emergence in the writings of Franz Boas, Edward Sapir 
and Benjamin Whorf and later contestations through Noam Chomsky’s early work on Universal 
Grammar reveal that the question whether language shapes worldview has been answered 
with convoluted results.  Rather than an emphatic ‘yes’ or ‘no’; it is really “to what extent and 
kind of impact does language have on thought” that may be the real question (Swoyer, 2003).  
This dissertation engages with this theoretical debate. Like studies before it the research found 
crossover in both universal aspects of spatial expression and particular aspects leading us 
back to questions of extents and impacts. 
 
2.2.6    Cognitive Linguistics  
This research is situated within the linguistic framework of what, used to be called Space 
Grammar, and is now referred to as Cognitive Linguistics.  This branch of linguistic study has 
refocused their attention on “meaning” and its relationship to thought or underlying cognitive 
pathways (conceptualization).  Cognitive Linguistics was developed as an approach to 
language study in the 1970s by George Lakoff, Ron Langacker and Len Talmy, amongst 
others, as a reaction against the focus on ‘formalism’ that was dominant in linguistics during 
the 1950s and 1960s (Evans & Green, 2006).   Cognitive Linguistics has been gaining 

35 
 
 
momentum as a movement through the four decades since (Geeraerts & Cuyckens, 2007).   
Under Cognitive Linguistics, language is considered to “offer a window into cognitive function, 
providing insights into the nature, structure and organization of thoughts and ideas” (Evans & 
Green, 2006, p. 5).  The focus lies on function or context.  This is considered to be in a polar 
relationship with the early works of Noam Chomsky, which treated language as an innate 
autonomous function contained with the mind and less influenced by environment (Chomsky, 
1965).  Within cognitive linguistics “the formal structures of language are studied not as if they 
were autonomous, but as reflections of general conceptual organization, categorizational 
principles, processing mechanisms, and experiential and environmental influences.” 
(Geeraerts & Cuyckens, 2007, p. 3)  Cognitive Linguistics places language within the body, in 
relationship to the mind, which is then influenced by its environment.  It is considered 
appropriate for this study in its approach to language and the extrapolation of meaning through 
the body in space ; physical, architectural, social, ceremonial and artistic.  
  
2.2.6.1  Metaphor and analogy as a component of Cognitive Linguistics   
Metaphorical analogy is an important component of Cognitive Linguistic theory and is relevant 
to this thesis because the major conceptual tool for spatial conceptualization in Kwak’wala 

36 
 
 
appears to be metaphorical.   Lakoff & Johnson (1980) define metaphor as “understanding and 
experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another” (p. 5). For example:  “the body is the house 
of the soul”.  An analogy is when something is compared as being “like” something else in 
another domain: “the door of the house is like a mouth, swallowing the visitors who enter”.  
Gentner & Jeziorski (1993) describe analogy as:   
 
…mapping of knowledge from one domain (the base) into another (the target) such 
that a system of relations that holds among the base objects also holds among the 
target objects.  In interpreting an analogy, people seek to put the objects of the base 
in one-to-one correspondence with the objects of the target so as to obtain the 
maximal structural match. (p. 49) 
 
The concepts of metaphor and analogy are so similar that they are intertwined.  It is observed 
that “conceptual metaphors are mappings across domains that structure our reasoning, our 
experience, and our everyday language” (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980).  Metaphor is considered 
“to refer to a pattern of conceptual association” (Grady, 2007).  Prior to the emergence of 
cognitive linguistics, metaphor was considered a linguistic convention restricted in usage to the 

37 
 
 
poetic and rhetorical (Lakoff & Johnson).   Since the 1980s however the consideration that 
metaphor is an intrinsic component of the way we understand our world has become 
increasingly viable. 
 
The consideration of metaphor and analogy is appropriate because in my study spatial 
analogy is used often to create understanding from source (base) domains to target domains.  
Concepts are understood in relationship to one another and this comparative quality is highly 
prevalent within Kwak’wala speech, both every-day and ceremonial.   For example, the 
statement, Lan nagałtawix ťaxala’ yasan wiwump’woła.  “I follow the road made by my late 
ancestors” is a metaphor for maintaining traditions (Boas, 1949, p. 238).  Note the word ťaxala’ 
“ road” is the same word used for “the door of a house”.  These metaphors cannot be fully 
understood under literal definitions but manifest their full meanings only under 
contextual/cultural based paradigms.   In addition, metaphors have been found not to be 
simple one to one mappings with defined boundaries but map to complexes of linked 
understandings.  It is this matrix of linked understandings which create a particular perspective 
or understanding of the world and is situated as part of the deep understructure of Figure 2.2 
and Figure 2.4. 

38 
 
 
2.2.6.2  Prototype Theory and Radial Categories as Cognitive Linguistic theories 
In my written research I use formal morphological analysis as a technique and then the 
theories of Metaphorical Analogy, Prototype theory and Radial Categories from Cognitive 
Linguistics to extrapolate meaning and conceptual associations in the Kwak'wala language.   I 
then compare visual, architectural, and ceremonial examples to test whether the structures 
and concepts underlying Kwakwaka'wakw thought are consistent with word based expressions 
in speech.   
 
Prototype Theory addresses the concept of categories.  As we develop our understanding of 
the world categories are fundamental to our understanding of what things are.  Prototype 
Theory arose out of the reconsideration of the boundaries of categories for category 
membership.   Prior traditions of thought around the issue of categories aligned membership in 
a category as bounded by the possession of certain features which gave each member equal 
membership.  Prototype Theory argues against this and posits that the membership within 
categories are not equal but based on how much a member can map prototypical features but 
certainly do not, nor are required, to share all features (Rosch & Mervis, 1975).   The “prior 
tradition of thought” is called the Classical Theory (Lakoff, 1987; Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk, 

39 
 
 
2007) and was applied in ways that divided the world into defined domains which were thought 
to map to a predetermined reality.  For example, the category bird could be applied to “beings 
that fly, have feathers, and lay eggs”.   However, we find there are many anomalies to the 
definition.  Is an ostrich still a bird if it cannot fly, or penguin if it doesn’t have feathers?  What 
we find instead of cleanly defined predetermined categories with equal membership is a 
central prototype with varied membership.  Some members fit the prototype for membership in 
all features, what Eleanor Rosch (1973) defined as ‘best examples’ and so are central while 
others share only a few features and so are peripheral.   Categories then can be said to have a 
central prototype and fuzzy boundaries, not necessarily clearly defined, for membership.   
Some items can have membership in more than one category.  In some ways the idea is 
linked to a nature/nurture, objective/subjective debate.  In the Classical Theory categories are 
fixed by nature.  They just are.    In Prototype Theory categories can be influenced and defined 
by culture, and language can reflect differences in categorization.  Through Prototype Theory 
once more is expressed a relationship between form and meaning, what is in the world and 
what is in the mind.  In (Figure 2.5) I present an interpretation of the differences between a 
classical perspective of the world “as it is” and a cognitive perspective where the world is 
experienced through a lens of language and culture drawn from Lakoff (1987).

The concept of Radial Categories emerges out of Prototype Theory and addresses the notion 
of meaning in relationship to the prototype.  This is described as radiating from the centre with 
members who are most like the prototype closer to the centre and members least like the 
prototype occupying the periphery.  Lakoff uses the concept of “mother” as an example to 
explain radial categories.  If “mother” represents the prototype or central ideal then 
subcategories and non-central extensions are variations. Thus, birth mother and foster mother 
are not understood purely on their own terms; they are comprehended via their relationship to

the central model of mother (Lakoff, 1987:91).  These theories have strong implications for 
technical linguistic debate but my primary interest is in cross-cultural categorization.    
 
Cross-culturally and across different languages categories can possibly share features but 
differ in their prototype and radial category membership.  This means associated meanings 
may vary from culture to culture.   When considering spatial concepts and the words which 
delineate those concepts in the Kwak’wala language there appeared patterns of associated 
meanings which could be considered categorical.  I arranged these into groups with the base 
stem as the central or prototypical concept.  With the addition of suffixes the central meaning 
(prototype) is added onto creating radial extensions (of meaning) which are still associated to 
the central meaning.  I consider these groupings to be conceptual categories which are 
culturally specific.  For example, in chapter 6 and 7 the stem ‘na- appears to exhibit radial 
extension with culturally specific linkages.  Figure 2.6 shows the ‘na- stem as a category 
whose central concept is provided by the stem and extensions by additional suffixes.  While 
initially we might consider the extended meanings “upriver, the first” and “the day, the world”  
to be unrelated we see through a specific cultural perspective defined by history, environment 
and belief systems, explained in chapter 6 and 7, that they are indeed conceptually related.

By analyzing radial categories formed around the stems of spatial terminology in Kwak’wala I 
was able to make sense of metaphorical analogy in non-linguistic expressions.  It helped to 
answer non-linguistic questions such as “Why is the back portion of the inside of a traditional 
house called “upriver”?  This is answered in chapter 6.

2.2.7     Anthropology  
While the morphological analysis of Kwak’wala terms relating to space is situated within the 
discipline of linguistics, the cultural analysis of this thesis is situated within anthropology. 
Within academics, culture is generally understood as an anthropological inquiry.  While the 
general subject is all of humanity historically, anthropology has spent much of its time 
observing ‘other’ cultures (non-Western), though this is changing in modern contexts due to a 
heightened comprehension of colonialism and its relationship to anthropology as a discipline 
(Asad, 1973; Pels, 1999).   The majority of the material examined as part of this research was 
collected under the discipline of anthropology.   This includes reviews of both ethnographic 
data and material culture collections of the Kwakwaka’wakw. 
 
While Boas’ linguistic material has provided the base of my analysis of words and phrases in 
Kwak’wala he is also one of the primary sources for ethnographic material.   Boas is 
considered widely to be the ‘father of American Anthropology’.  He originally trained as a 
geographer in Germany in the late 19th Century and then moved to the United States in part, to 
escape the rise in anti-Semitism that was prevalent in Europe at that time (Darnell, 1998, 
Rohner, 1969).   Over his lifetime, he brought to a largely undefined discipline a set of 

44 
 
 
principles and practices that helped define it.  One theory to emerge from his work was that of 
cultural relativity, a belief that an individual’s culture, history and environment will influence 
their perceptions and beliefs and knowledge of the world (Boas,1911,1949).  It was under this 
premise that Boas believed in collecting as much data as possible in the words and 
perspectives of the people or culture he was attempting to study (Berman, 1996; Boas 1949).  
It was only under this methodology, Boas believed, that Western euro-centricism could be 
alleviated, though never completely overcome.   Boas studied many cultures, but the people 
he studied the most, over the course of a five decade engagement (1890-1940), were the 
Kwakwaka’wakw (Kwakiutl).  Much of the source material for both the linguistic and cultural 
research in this thesis comes from the Boas/Hunt corpus.  Due to his belief in collecting as 
much information as possible in the words of the people he was studying, Boas, through his 
relationship with George Hunt, a Kwakwaka’wakw insider of Tlingit and Scottish/English 
descent, compiled vast amounts of texts in Kwak’wala with English translation (Berman, 1996).  
In describing this material Berman states: 
 
Franz Boas published voluminously on the subject of his primary ethnographic 
interest, the people he called the “Kwakiutl.”  …Nearly four thousand pages, about 

45 
 
 
four-fifths of the total, consist of translated but unannotated Kwak’wala language 
text.  Boas filled five volumes exclusively with myth and other narrative materials 
(1910, 1935-43; Boas & Hunt 1905, 1906) and another six with ethnographic data 
on subjects ranging from cooking and hunting methods, to chiefly inheritance and 
succession, and to prayers, dreams, and the bird-souls of human beings (Boas 
1909a, 1921, 1925a, 1930).  Still another massive volume of mostly non-narrative 
texts was in preparation at the time of Boas’ death (HCU XIV). (p. 216) 
  
In addition to this impressive amount of published work on the Kwakwaka’wakw is an equally 
impressive amount of unpublished material.   It is no understatement to say that Boas was 
prolific in acquiring ethnographic information.   In order to accomplish this, however he needed 
the help of his ethnographic assistant George Hunt. 
 
The relationship of George Hunt (1854-1933) as Boas’ primary ethnographic informer on the 
Kwakwaka’wakw cannot be understated.  The majority of the raw data compiled by Boas on 
the “Kwakiutl” was collected by George Hunt (Cannizzo, 1983; Berman, 1994 & 1996).  Hunt 
was not Kwakwaka’wakw by birth but was raised amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw when his 

46 
 
 
father Robert Hunt, a trader for the Hudson’s Bay company moved to `Tsaxis (Fort Rupert) in 
Kwakwaka’wakw territory with his high-ranking Tlingit wife.  George Hunt was born in Fort 
Rupert and eventually married a Kwakwaka’wakw woman.  He strategically married his sons to 
high-ranking Kwakwaka’wakw women.  He lived his life immersed in the culture and was fluent 
in Kwak’wala despite his first language most likely being Tlingit (Berman, 1994).  Together, 
over the course of five decades (1890-1940), Boas through Hunt was able to publish massive 
amounts of information on the Kwakwaka’wakw (Boas, 1897, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1921, 1929, 
1930, 1934, 1935, 2002; Boas & Hunt, 1902-1905, 1908).  The topics covered by this 
extensive research include, birth, coming of age, marriage and death rites, social structure, 
traditional economies and harvesting practices, extensive histories, both genealogical and 
mythological, geographies, ceremonial inquiry and artistic documentation of dances, songs 
and material culture.    
 
While much of the data used for this thesis emerges both from Boas and Hunt’s extensive  
literature on Kwakwaka’wakw social customs it is supplemented by a corpus of other published 
and unpublished documentation pertinent to the Kwakwaka’wakw including the work of Curtis, 
1915; Galois, 1994; Barbeau, 1950; Drucker & Heizer, 1967; Ford, 1940; Rohner & Rohner 

47 
 
 
1970, amongst others.  In addition it is supplemented by material culture and collection notes, 
housed in institutions including the British Columbia Archives, the National Archives in Ottawa, 
and the U.B.C Museum of Anthropology.  An additional research trip was made in 2009 to the 
National Archives in Washington DC, Columbia University and the American Museum of 
Natural History in New York and the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in order to 
review and collect the unpublished and original manuscripts of George Hunt and Franz Boas 
as well as their personal correspondence. 
 
2.2.7.1 Self Criticality of Anthropology and Visual Arts 
The discipline of Anthropology under which the majority of this material was collected has 
fallen under criticism for its colonial roots.  Frideres (1988) defines colonialism as a staged 
process of outside nations taking over territories, destructively supressing indigenous 
populations, imposing the colonial culture as dominant and rendering the colonized people as 
dependent upon the new imposed system.   Colonialism is influenced by racism and the belief 
that the colonizer is superior to those colonized (pp. 367-370).  The discipline of anthropology 
was colonial in that it originally came into being on the premise of a Western belief in its own 
cultural superiority against which other cultures would be measured.   In self- critical response 

48 
 
 
to its origins, modern anthropology has turned its eye on its own practice of studying non-
Western cultures under a Eurocentric vision.  The discipline has become self-reflexive.   Pels 
(2008) has suggested that this self-criticality of the discipline is “an anthropology of 
anthropology” (p.280).   
 
It was during the 1960s and 1970s where anthropology and Western art drew closer in their 
agendas as Western art theory also became increasingly self-reflective and self-conscious of 
its inherent Eurocentrism.  Western art began to question the hierarchy of art as “primitive”, 
emerging from non-Europeans and “high or fine art”, emerging from Europeans.   This led to a 
dynamic consciousness of the construction of spaces both physical (institutional spaces such 
as the academy, the museum and the gallery) and their conceptual underpinnings (what these 
spaces represented).   What was once considered anthropological could be re-contextualized 
as art and what was once strictly art became anthropological (Morphy and Perkins, 2006).  
This crossover and questioning of disciplines, this self-consciousness of historicity and 
context, also comes into play in my explorations of Kwakwaka’wakw  “forms” and “meanings” 
within institutions such as the University of Victoria, the UBC Museum of Anthropology and the 
Vancouver Art Gallery. This self-reflexivity is also mirrored in my own academic exercise of 

49 
 
 
studying the Kwakwaka’wakw while being Kwakwaka’wakw where questions of authorship, 
authority, voice and objectivity come into play in complex ways.   
 
My anthropological research most actively engages with the contemporary anthropological 
sub-divisions of Anthropological Linguistics and Visual Anthropology.   Anthropological 
Linguistics basically embodies the concept that culture can be revealed through language and 
also shares a conceptual crossover with Cognitive Linguistic enquiry (Palmer, 2007).  Visual 
Anthropology was chosen because it values the visual and the performative on par with the 
written and its crossover with Visual art.    
 
2.2.8     Anthropological Linguistics 
Linguistic Anthropology has maintained a particular approach to language that studies “the 
relations among language, society, thought and culture” (Danesi, 2004, p.VII).  Linguistic 
Anthropology is one of the main four subdisciplines of American anthropology; the other three 
subdisciplines of anthropology being Sociocultural Anthropology, Physical Anthropology and 
Archeology.  Where the discipline of linguistics has become more focused on the formal 
aspects of language since the mid-20th century, Linguistic Anthropology has maintained the 
interest in language as a cultural phenomenon. It is invested in the documentation of 

50 
 
 
indigenous languages with a particular interest in North America.  The defined connection to 
culture is an important distinction within this discipline.  While linguistics provides the analytical 
tools for formal analysis at the word and phrase levels, Anthropological Linguistics assists with 
the broader contextual inquiry into the connection and influence of culture.   In regards to the 
discipline of Linguistic Anthropology Danesi (2004) also states: 
 
The underlying premise that guides most of the work in linguistic anthropology is the 
idea that language structures reflect experiential-conceptual structures which, in 
turn, reflect social structures.   This is not a discovery of linguistics, of course.  One 
of the first, in depth, articulations of this very premise can be found in a landmark 
treatise of 1725, The New Science, written by the great Neopolitan philosopher 
Giambattista Vico (1688-1744).  Vico maintained that we come to understand the 
world through our imaginative use of language, especially in its use of metaphor.  As 
remarkable as that insight was, it is really only today that metaphor has finally 
started to attract the attention of a broad spectrum of anthropologists and linguists. 
(p. VII) 
 

51 
 
 
This description of Linguistic Anthropology shows much cross-over with Cognitive Linguistics.  
The extensions of language use to social structure and the mention of metaphor as a method 
for understanding the world are especially pertinent to this thesis as explained in chapters 3-7.  
  
2.2.9     Visual Anthropology 
My engagement with Visual Anthropology is twofold, the first is an analysis of existing imagery 
and material culture collections for research purposes, and the second, the development of a 
body of visual works which act as experiments in the non-linguistic conceptual translation of 
the Kwakwakw’wakw spatial concepts which emerge from this research along with the text 
based analysis conducted under linguistic inquiry. Visual Anthropology initially emerged out of 
a modern engagement with visual documentation within anthropology in the 20th Century as 
photographic and film technologies developed.  It has extended to encompass “the belief that 
culture is manifested through visible symbols embedded in gestures, ceremonies, rituals and 
artifacts situated in constructed and natural settings” (Ruby, 1996).  There exists in Museums 
and other institutional archives a vast amount of visual material documenting the 
Kwakwaka’wakw.   Since the late 19th century collectors (including Boas and Hunt) gathered 
Kwakwaka’wakw  “artifacts” for museum institutions such as The American Museum of Natural 

52 
 
 
History, The Chicago Field Museum, The Canadian Museum of Civilization, the Royal British 
Columbia Museum, and the University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology amongst 
others (Jacknis, 2002 ).   A review of the masks, ceremonial regalia and accoutrements, 
architectural models etc. that form these collections has assisted in defining cultural aspects of 
Kwakwaka’wakw ways of thinking.     
 
In addition to the material culture documentation there exist collections of visual films and 
photographs.  In 1930, Boas was one of the first anthropologists to document the 
Kwakwaka’wakw on film (Ruby, 1980).  Edward Curtis quite remarkably had made the 
Kwakwaka’wakw the subject of a feature film in 1914 as an amateur ethnologist (Bunn-
Marcuse, 2005).   During the latter part of the Nineteenth Century the Kwakwaka’wakw were 
photographed by various government interests mostly invested in the issues of land (Savard, 
2005).  George Hunt himself considered the ethnographic potential of image based 
documentation in a letter to Boas in 1907, when he said that it could “show you every thing 
Plainer then writing it alon.”5 (Savard, 2005, p.55).  It was also George Hunt who greatly 
assisted Edward Curtis in the filming of “In the Land of the Head-Hunters” (Bunn-Marcuse, 
                                                 
5 Original spelling errors retained

2005).  From here the visual, audio and filmic documentation of the Kwakwaka’wakw has 
grown in to a massive corpus with ever changing contexts and dynamics based on access and 
availability. Throughout this thesis I have used visual images to exemplify much of the 
analysis.  This includes diagrammatical images and photographs. 
      
Visual Anthropology is useful for its focus to the context and meaning of image making which 
provides us with a comparison with language with the premise that they are joined by cognitive 
function.  I analyzed spatial words and phrases in the Kwak’wala language for meaning 
through morphological breakdown and then sought to pair the linguistic markers with their 
visual signifiers in spatial architecture, social relations and artistic expression.   Of course, 
spatial understanding influences so many other domains of thought (such as time) that it can 
be considered a major pillar of cultural worldview.  I found that this was indeed the case within 
my own analysis. 
 
It is primarily visuality that provides the alternative comparative expression to text in this thesis.  
Visuality can be defined as images, objects in space (sculpture and archirtecture) and 
imaginative geographic mapping of the landscape which is beyond our ability to survey 

54 
 
 
through simple vision.  In this context imagination, or “seeing with the mind”, is considered just 
as important as the biological process of “seeing with the eyes.”   In other words, how does 
language create an image within the mind which then becomes manifest in the world, or vice 
versa?   How are meanings constructed and then connected between the domains of 
language, thought and reality?  Mark Johnson (1987), one of the leading scholars in cognitive 
linguistics proposes that imagination is a major component of the construction of meaning and 
that its dismissal to the periphery in modern Western philosophical and cultural traditions is 
highly problematic.  He states, “any adequate account of meaning and rationality must give a 
central place to embodied and imaginative structures of understanding by which we grasp our 
world” (p, xiii).   Johnson, however does not align the imagination simply with the mind but 
connects it strongly to the body.  He states: 
 
Our reality is shaped by the patterns of our bodily movement, the contours of our 
spatial and temporal orientation, and the forms of our interactions with objects.  It is 
never merely a matter of abstract conceptualizations and propositional judgements 
(p. xix). 
 

55 
 
 
 I have attempted to engage with these theories with the visual and the physical in two ways:  
first, by examining linguistic and cultural manifestations of Kwakwaka’wakw space and writing 
about it and second, by imaginatively and physically engaging with Kwakwaka’wakw spatial 
concepts in the creation of artworks.  This resulted in the visual component of the thesis 
explored in chapter 8.  
 
2.3   Visual (experiential) component of the thesis 
The written component of this thesis is the literal translation of the underlying concepts of 
space which emerged from linguistic analysis of spatial terms while the artworks form the non-
linguistic, non-literal expression of these concepts.   What they are joined by is their 
engagement with the spatial concepts and belief systems of Kwakwaka’wakw culture.  If form 
(language and material culture) and meaning are intimately related then changing the contexts 
of their manifestation would test this connection in an innovative and dynamic way by replacing 
the institutional context (university to museum/gallery) and medium (writing to visual art).   The 
subject matter remains consistent; the concept of space which is culturally specific to the 
Kwakwaka’wakw and has a relationship to both form and meaning. 
 

56 
 
 
The inclusion of a visual component beyond the review and inclusion of visual data in this 
thesis is an important one.  It highlights the interdisciplinary nature of the thesis as both 
necessary and integral.   Both anthropology and Western art history as academic disciplines 
have problematic relationships with the representation of Aboriginal cultures (Ames, 1992; 
Battiste & Youngblood Henderson, 2000).  Throughout art history Aboriginal cultures have 
been excluded from the dominant discourses on architecture, sculpture and painting.  
Aboriginal art was approached most often as subject matter, the passive object of the Western 
European gaze.  Not until the 1960’s did institutions begin to consider the art of Native 
Americans as possibly ‘fine art’ rather than anonymous craft or anthropological artifact. The 
National Gallery of Canada didn’t exhibit Aboriginal objects in its Historical Canadian Galleries 
until 2003 (Whitelaw, 2006).   These attempts at inclusion came with their own sets of 
complexities and confusion as the categories of art as defined by the dominant Western 
structures could not accommodate the original intents of the works themselves.  In collecting 
and exhibiting these objects art history had, through the gallery, and anthropology had, 
through the museums, transformed the material culture of Native Americans into objects of 
their own consumption leaving little but their aesthetic formal qualities intact.    
 

57 
 
 
If we consider the material culture of the Kwakwaka’wakw as a grammar, or a form of 
language, then we can comparatively say that the surface forms or “words” of that grammar 
were placed in foreign contexts, or that their relationship to meaning (their understructure) was 
disrupted. This disruption basically appropriated the formal expressions of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw  in order to express its own concepts around what those words/objects 
symbolize.  To re-frame this complex idea through the theory of Saussure, one could say that 
the connection between signifier and signified is disrupted by the exchange of one cultural 
conceptual understructure for another.  While the surface form stays somewhat intact its actual 
meaning has been appropriated.   For example, does a mask hanging in a gallery or a 
storefront have the same meaning removed from its original cultural context?  Or does the 
mask become a symbol of the meanings of those institutions which have re-framed the object 
as “artifact” or “art” when originally it had no relation to these definitions? 
 
 Over the course of research for this dissertation a large body of major contemporary visual 
works were created and publicly exhibited under modern gallery and museum settings.  Each 
exhibition, over the course of 2006-2012, sought to manifest the spatial relationships that I was 
learning about through linguistic analysis combined with anthropological ethnographic 

58 
 
 
research in institutions and museums.  In this regard the crossover between art and 
anthropology becomes amplified.  Issues of representation and perception within art and 
anthropology were considered complimentary (Schneider & Wright, 2006).  I exhibited in 
anthropological spaces, fine art spaces, and general public spaces.   
 
I have included this component into my research because ultimately it is my chosen medium of 
expression but also because I was seeking to explore how language and culture intersect on 
the level of conceptualization.  Could I create artworks that reflected the conceptualization of 
space as it was expressed in the Kwak’wala language?   If Kwakwaka’wakw language and 
culture were closely aligned, then by studying and learning Kwak’wala spatial concepts I would 
concurrently be developing a general understanding of the occupation of space.  If the 
concepts were substantial enough at the conceptual level the hypothesis is that I would be 
able to apply them to alternative spaces in ways consistent with traditional Kwakwaka’wakw 
thinking. 
   
Over the course of my research on the Kwak’wala language I was actively engaged in making 
art both for traditional contexts and museum/gallery spaces.  Theoretically, the contemporary 

59 
 
 
creation of traditional, in-community works would through the process of generational imitation, 
most likely reflect the concepts of space found in the Kwak’wala language i.e. the 
conceptualization of the ceremonial space within a traditional bighouse will remain the same 
through the consistency of physical features.   In order to test the viability of spatial concepts 
beyond mere formal imitation, the testing ground then became contemporary gallery spaces.   
Without the grounding features of traditional community based cultural expression could the 
concepts of space as expressed in the Kwak’wala language be replicated under alternative 
mediums within alternative spaces?    
 
Four major works in particular examined Kwakwaka’wakw concepts of space as expressed in 
the Kwak’wala language and attempted to express them under varied contemporary settings.   
In 2006, Baḱwinaťsi – the Container for Souls” was exhibited at the public gallery Artspeak in 
Gastown, Vancouver B.C.   In 2008, The House of the Ghosts” was exhibited at the Vancouver 
Art Gallery.  In 2010, Wanx’id –to hide, to be hidden was exhibited at the U.B.C. Museum of 
Anthropology and in 2012, The Land is a Person was installed as a permanent outdoor artwork 
in North Vancouver, B.C.  Each of these works engaged with concepts of Kwakwaka’wakw 

60 
 
 
space to various degrees.   The visual works act as complements and integral exploratory 
research documents to the written component of this thesis.   
 
By including a non-literal component I am also challenging what might be considered the 
'superiority' of writing over the acts of memory, repetition in action, ceremonialism, visuality 
and physicality relied on by non-literal societies.   I am actively challenging that “text and 
language are the only paradigms for understanding and explanation, and that meaning can 
only be discovered by translating or decoding ‘texts’ “(Schneider & Wright, 2006, p. 8) and 
taking up the challenge that “anthropology’s iconophobia and self-imposed restriction of visual 
expression to text-based models needs to be overcome by a critical engagement with a range 
of material and sensual practices in the contemporary arts” (p. 4).  I am also providing a non-
linguistic method (art) to express underlying concepts that have been derived from linguistic 
analysis.   By utilizing a non-linguistic expression I am able to consider whether the concepts 
of spatial relationship as expressed in Kwak’wala are connected strongly enough on the 
conceptual level that they can be replicated in completely alternative contexts.  The results of 
these experiments in applying traditional spatial concepts derived from the Kwak’wala 
language into contemporary spaces is presented in chapter 8. 

61 
 
 
2.4 Summary 
The relationship to “form” and “meaning” is mapped to the Kwak’wala language, as “form“, and 
the Kwakwaka’wakw culture as “meaning”.  In order to explore this relationship I use linguistic 
morphological analysis to derive the literal meanings of Kwak’wala spatial terminology.   I then 
cross reference this with cultural meanings as expressed through architecture, social structure, 
narrative, and art.   From this analysis emerged a structural analogical mapping of space from 
the body, to the house, to the land.  This then becomes a rich source of metaphorical 
conceptualization about the Kwakwaka’wakw understanding of the world.  As a compliment to 
the written component of this thesis which details these finding I created a body of 
contemporary artworks which sought to express these Kwak’wala derived spatial concepts 
using non-linguistic expression.   The replacement of the formal expression (art for language), 
is an exploration of whether the shared conceptual understructure can remain intact.   By 
analogy, if Kwak’wala is replaced by English amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw how much of an 
effect will this have on Kwakwaka’wakw culture (worldview)?   The next chapter presents the 
u-[a’w-] stem in Kwak’wala and its relationship to the body, the house and the land.

         Dream of Lakis 
        “I dreamed I had been called by a man to go with him to the upper side of our world, the 
sky.  He took my right hand.  Then he went up holding my hand while we were going 
straight up.  Then we passed through the door in the middle of the upper side of our 
world.  The man showed me everything that was in the house there.  Then he said to 
me that we should go on.  We went along.  Then we came to the hole in the edge of 
the world.  Then he said “Through this (hole) pass the children when they are born, 
when they come from the upper side of the world.  Now pass through it and go home.  I 
am going to help you that it may not be hard for you to pass through,” Then I went on, 
but before I arrived I awoke. (Boas1925, pp.48-49) 
 
3.1 Analogy of the body, the house, and the land 
In the Kwak’wala language spatial concepts can be expressed both through speech and the use 
of metaphor, as well as through the linguistic structure of the words.   The spatial concepts 

63 
 
 
expressed in language forms can be correlated to alternative cultural expressions such as 
public oratory, narratives, rituals, ceremonies and artistic creation.   Blevins & Blevins (2009) 
describe analogy as “a general cognitive process that transfers specific information or 
knowledge from one instance or domain (the analogue, base or source) to another (the target)” 
(p.2).  This chapter deals with a specific Kwakwaka’wakw emphasis on spatial structural 
analogy from the small-scale to large-scale domains, which introduces the micro/macro 
expression of body=house=landscape metaphor through the use of the stem form u-[a’w] in the 
Kwak’wala language.  Chapter 4 deals with space in relationship to concepts of the “body/self”  
Chapter 5 deals with space in relationship to concepts of the “house.”  Chapter 6 then deals with 
space in relationship to concepts of the “land”.  Throughout all three topics the metaphorical 
relationships between the body, the house, and the land are interwoven.        
 
In Kwak’wala the notion of structural similarity/analogy between objects and the animate body is 
manifest on an ever increasing scale from vessels such as boxes and bowls to canoes and 
houses, and ultimately extends onto the landscape or the world.   Under this system structural 
similarity is applied as a primary component of spatial categorization.   Structural similarity 
becomes a linguistically “marked” characteristic that conceptually links one object to another.  

64 
 
 
By “marked” I mean that there is a distinct linguistic form that expresses this concept.   In 
Kwak’wala, the animate body acts as the primary referential for physical objects in space.   On 
the small-scale, a box can be conceived of as conceptually analogous to the body, having a 
front and back, two sides, a top and a bottom.  By extension, on an expanding scale, the body 
becomes analogous to the house, the house then becomes analogous to the ‘na’mima 
“family/community group” and, ultimately on the grandest scale, the landscape (world).   Under 
this premise the landscape is considered to share the characteristics of the body in the same 
way that an object such as a box does.   Structural similarity is emphasized, while difference is 
accorded to scale.   Due to the pervasiveness of this system reflected in the Kwak’wala 
language what might be considered less animate in English is applied more literal animation in 
Kwakwaka’wakw conceptualization.    
 
Kwakwaka’wakw traditional art and architecture exhibit visual manifestation of this concept.   
For example, a house can literally appear as a being whose doorway acts as a mouth that 
consumes the people who enter it.   The following photo (Figure 3.1) was taken by Edward S. 
Curtis in Gwayasdams (Gilford Island) village in 1914.  It depicts the house owned by Chief 
Johnny Scow.  The painted house-front depicts a sea-monster, a crest he acquired through his 

65 
 
 
first marriage with the ‘Namgis woman.  The doorway is positioned where the mouth opens.  In 
addition a pole depicting a whale, an inherited crest of the Kwikwasu’tinuxw, whom Johnny 
Scow was head chief of, is positioned so that guests must enter through the mouth.  Later this 
house-front was replaced with the image of a raven inherited from his second marriage.  In the 
raven rendition of the house a massive raven’s beak was carved over the doorway.

The visual representation of animate beings as houses is also found expressed in 
Kwakwaka’wakw historical  (mythical)  narratives that describe houses as living beings.  In the 
following narrative not only is the house entrance described as having a mouth which swallows 
its guests but the structural house-posts which hold the house up are capable of thought and 
speech.  
 
        Then Kawadilikala spoke: “That is done. Now brother, come to my house.  It is 
beyond this point.”  They paddled on, and when they had nearly reached 
Kawadilikala’s house, he said: “Brother, take care.  When I jump into my house, 
you and your slave must jump in at the same time.”  Now they arrived at the beach 
in front of the house of Kawadilikala.  They went ashore and walked up to the 
house.  When they arrived at the front of the house, the mouth of the door of 
Kawadilikala’s house opened.  They jumped in all at the same time and it bit only a 
corner of Tłutłatsa’s blanket.  Then the posts at the sides of the door spoke, and 
the one on the right hand side said: “You made them come to your house, 
Kawadilikala;” and the post on the left hand side said: “Now spread a mat and give 
your guests to eat, Chief.”  It is said that the crossbeams over the rear posts were 

67 
 
 
double-headed snakes (sisi’utł), which were constantly playing with their tongues. 
(Boas 1895, p. 387)   
 
While houses are the most obvious form of architectural/artistic analogical representations of 
the body, on a smaller scale, storage boxes and food dishes can be depicted as the body of an 
animate being whose cavity becomes a container.  This feast dish (Figure 3.2) from Gwa’yi 
(Kingcome Inlet) is carved in the image of a dzunukwa, a large, often sleepy and slow moving 
supernatural creature.  This being has been translated as “wild woman of the woods”. The large 
faces on either side are the lids to other feast dishes.

The landscape as well is animate and alive.   Rivers and mountains are depicted as having 
human characteristics and in some cases having been human at an earlier time.  The following 
story comes from the now extinct tribe of the Hoyalas, who used to occupy the northern tip of 
Vancouver Island but were wiped out due to introduced disease and inter-tribal war.  In it Chief

`Kumgusta’els (Wealth-Coming-Up) is transformed along with his attendant into an island by the 
great transformer `Kaniki’lakw. 
 
        Then the tribe learned that `Kaniki’lakw was coming to set everything right all  
        around our world.  Immediately the great Wealth-Coming-Up spoke to his tribe.   
And this is what he said to his tribe: “As soon as Lord `Kaniki’lakw comes, I shall ask him 
to transform me into a rock, and I shall be an island in this water, so that I may be seen by 
later generations.”  Thus he said.  Then one of his attendants also spoke and said, “O 
great chief!  I will also be transformed into a rock by Lord `Kaniki’lakw; but I will be under 
you, else you would remain on the rock in this water.”  Thus he said to him.  As soon as 
he stopped speaking they went out. 
         
        Then, after a long time, `Kaniki’lakw came.  Immediately the great one was invited by 
Chief Wealth-coming-up.  Then Lord `Kaniki’lakw went to his house, and Wealth-
coming-up spoke to `Kaniki’lakw.  He said to him, “O great Lord!  I invite you that 
you may turn me into a rock, that I may stay in the water at this river, that I may be 
prayed to by later generations.”  Thus he said to him.  Immediately the Lord called 

70 
 
 
him to go to the water, and immediately the great Wealth-coming-up went with his 
attendant and behind them went `Kaniki’lakw.  Then Wealth-coming-up and his 
attendant acted in their own way a little upstream of the place where water is drawn.  
Then the attendant lay down on his face, and the great Wealth-coming up sat on his 
back.  As soon as he had sat down, he was transformed into a rock.  Then the tribe 
of the past chief just prayed to `Kaniki’lakw, for they were really frightened by what 
they had seen being done to their chief.  That is the end. (Boas 1910, pp. 336-337) 
 
The transformative power of the land is a pervasive concept in Kwakwaka’wakw thought.  The 
body can be transformed into a tree, a rock, a river, a mountain and vice versa.  Houses are 
built or appear on the land in supernatural ways.  All is dynamic and animate.  These are just a 
few examples of the extension of structural characteristics of the body onto feast-dishes, houses 
and the land.   The structural analogue is the body, and it becomes the prototype for utilitarian 
objects, architecture and the landscape. 
 
 
 

71 
 
 
3.2 General concept of analogy in Kwakwaka’wakw  belief systems 
The Kwakwaka’wakw hold a philosophical belief in analogy in general.  In relationship to ideas 
of “cause and effect” the Kwakwaka’wakw believe that efforts in one domain of existence can 
have an effect on other levels.   For example, in order to affect events in the world as a whole 
one can through symbolic gesture imitate the desired outcome at a ritualistic level.  This gesture 
amplifies the probability through analogy that the desired outcome is achieved.  Expressing this 
belief system are the following examples: 
 
The soil from a land otter slide which is used as a magic means for influencing 
weather is called nawalakw.   It is said, “do not handle too roughly this supernatural 
one (namely the soil), otherwise our weather will be too rough” (gwa’la ałalisaxwa 
nawalakwex atłux ałalisants ‘nalax R628.7). (Boas 1949, p. 613) 
 
The soil from the land otter slide is thought to have supernatural properties analogous to nature.  
If the soil is handled roughly the weather may become rough in correspondence.  The belief 
expresses the notion that physical gesture at the bodily level can influence outcomes in the 
landscape.  Through speech and concurrent actions we see the idea of microcosmic and 

72 
 
 
macrocosmic analogical expansion.  Handling soil from the sea otter slide at the bodily level can 
have an effect on the world.  The metaphor of the body as equivalent to the landscape takes on 
ritualistic significance.  Further examples are; 
 
Prayer to the Migratory Birds 
“Welcome, Supernatural Ones, we have come to meet alive, friends, you, Long-Life-
Makers.  You have come and I pray you again that you have mercy and take out 
again, this my sickness when you go back to the place where you always disappear 
friends.  Now protect me again during the time when you are here in summer in this 
good country where I treat you well, Long-Life-Makers, Supernatural Ones.” Then 
the man himself replies to his words, on behalf of the birds.  He says, “Ha, I will do 
this.” (Boas 1930, p. 184) 
 
This prayer is based on the analogy of the body with the land in that the sickness which 
occupies the physical body of man is requested to leave in the same way that birds migrate 
over the landscape.  Under this premise it makes sense to use the metaphor of sickness “flying” 
away from the land/body.  The act of birds flying over the landscape is linked by the words of 

73 
 
 
the prayer as the analogical act of sickness leaving the body.  The following example regarding 
birth show the concept of analogy as ritualistically practiced through bodily gestures. 
 
         A pregnant woman was cautioned against certain foods; if, for example, she should 
eat salmon eggs or chew gum, their stickiness might be imparted to the fetus, 
causing it to adhere to her womb and thus rendering her delivery difficult.  By 
somewhat similar reasoning she refrained from making baskets lest the navel cord 
become twisted around the child’s neck.  To ensure an easy delivery she could carry 
out in pantomime an easy birth, taking four pebbles from the beach and letting them 
slip through her clothing onto the ground while expressing the hope, “May I be like 
these.”  Shortly before delivery it was thought she might further facilitate her delivery 
by opening her braids and drinking certain medicines. (Ford 1940, p. 30) 
 
These examples show that the concept of analogy was strongly prevalent within 
Kwakwaka’wakw belief systems.  Outside cultures might label this general belief in analogy 
across domains as “superstition” but I believe this dismissiveness to be misguided.  We have 
not yet come to understand the possible psychological and perhaps physical benefits to such 

74 
 
 
conceptualizations.   Ultimately, through a general acceptance and belief in analogy, which in 
this case I shall interpret as “the connectedness of all things”, the Kwakwaka’wakw  were 
especially primed for a highly metaphorical conceptualization of the world.  
  
3.3 Metaphor as a major cognitive process 
The difference between metaphor and analogy is slight.  An analogy aligns things as being 
similar, one object or characteristic being mapped onto another; one ‘thing’ is like another ‘thing’ 
drawing a connection between apparently different domains.  A metaphor maps this similarity 
more definitively; one ‘thing’ in one domain is another ‘thing’ in another domain.  The difference 
lies in focus and emphasis and can be subtle; a cognitive leap from comparison to definition.   
We could use the visual analogy of drawing a dotted line between things that are alike or similar 
to drawing a solid line or an equation sign between things.   Metaphor takes analogy one step 
further.   In general linguistic thought, metaphor has traditionally been thought of as a 
convention of language and expression.  As such, metaphor has been considered as peripheral 
or superfluous to conceptual systems.   Lakoff and Johnson (1980), have sought to dispute this 
understanding since their initial publication on the subject, “Metaphors We Live By”.  Lakoff and 
Johnson’s views emerged from prior studies conducted by Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953) and 

75 
 
 
Eleanor Rosch (1973, 1975) on ‘family resemblances’ and ‘categorization’, as well as early 
studies of how language reflects the conceptual systems of speakers explored by Edward Sapir 
(1921) and Benjamin Whorf (1956), both contemporaries influenced by the work of Franz Boas.    
Drawing from this base of theoretical exploration Lakoff and Johnson propose that rather than 
being a simple convention of language, metaphor is our fundamental way of understanding our 
world. “…metaphor is not just a matter of language, that is, of mere words.  We shall argue that, 
on the contrary, human thought processes are largely metaphorical.  This is what we mean 
when we say that the human conceptual system is metaphorically structured and defined.” (p.6) 
    
3.4  Metaphorical extensions of the body  
Examples of metaphorical extension analogous to the body do exist in other languages.   In 
English, terms such as ‘mouth of the river’,’ foot of the mountain’ and ‘head of the family’ are 
examples but their application has cultural specificity  and the resulting conceptualization of 
relationships carries different interpretation than that which emerges from Kwak’wala.  J. 
Douglas Porteous (1986) calls this the body-landscape metaphor, and in relationship to Western 
literature he writes: 
 

76 
 
 
         The metaphorical use of body imagery in relation to landscape is fundamental in the 
Western world.  The renaissance metaphor that understood the earth to be modeled 
on the human body has generally been regarded as a one-way relation, ‘landscape 
as body.’  It finds its expression in generic landscape naming.  In imaginative 
literature at least, the reverse relation, ‘body as landscape,’ is of frequent 
occurrence and continues well into the machine age.  The body in question is 
generally female, and the culmination of the ‘body as landscape’ metaphor is 
pornotopia. (p.2) 
 
Porteous considers that in Western societies the concept of feminine gender has been linked to 
concepts of nature and that notions around taming and dominating the land are embedded in a 
highly patriarchal culture that projects notions of the feminine onto the landscape.  He also 
concludes that the metaphor while certainly present in art and literature bears little scientific 
value; the most highly valued aspect of Western culture along with technology.  In contrast the 
body-landscape metaphor as it emerges in Kwakwaka’wakw culture and language appears to 

77 
 
 
be gender neutral7 and a primary mode of conceptualizing phenomenon in the world.  The main 
purpose of this chapter however, is not to compare English and Kwak’wala expressions 
regarding the body-landscape metaphor but to analyze how this metaphor is manifest in 
Kwakwaka’wakw thought through art and architecture.   It was found that the “house” was an 
integral intermediary between the body and the land so the metaphor, as interpreted for the 
Kwakwaka’wakw, is put forward as the Body=House=Landscape metaphor.    An analysis of 
Kwak’wala linguistic forms in combination with Kwakwaka’wakw cultural practices exhibits a 
particular, more pervasive and literal manifestation than English.   The concept is emphasized 
linguistically through an unusual morphemic stem u- [a’w-] through its classification function as 
well as with suffixation. 
 
3.5   The Kwak’wala stem u- [a’w-] 
Kwak’wala is a polysynthetic language.   Kwak’wala words are the combination of stems and 
suffixes, sometimes several.   The amount of suffixes in Kwak’wala is vast and the construction 
of words without suffixation is small.   It is the combination of stems and suffixes that create 
                                                 
7I found little evidence of Kwakwaka’wakw gender conceptualization applied to the house or the landscape.  
I thought it interesting also to note that gender does not play a major role in the Kwak’wala pronoun 
system, as Kwak’wala pronouns are gender neutral.  See Chapter 4 for pronoun descriptions. 

78 
 
 
complex meanings.   A single word composed of several morphemes, each carrying distinct 
meaning, can convey the same amount of information that in English requires a sentence.  
Franz Boas’ (1947) Kwak’wala dictionary catalogues words on the basis of the onset phoneme8 
of stems (first letter of stem).   He then provides subsets of the stem combined with a vast array 
of suffixes that create new words and extended meanings (like paradigms).   This organizational 
system is appropriate to the polysemous character of the Kwak’wala language.   Boas’ system 
also works because Kwak’wala while heavily reliant on suffixation does not exhibit prefixation in 
the same way.   In other words, the construction of words in Kwak’wala is generally stem initial 
with modifying suffix(es) following.   Where there does exist what appears to be prefixation is in 
actuality reduplication where the stem undergoes a process of copying in order to express a 
range of concepts.    We can say then, that in general Kwak’wala word structure consists of the 
joining of word-initial stems, carrying base information that are further elaborated in meaning by 
the addition of a suffix(es).   While for the most part stems are bound they are not devoid of 
meaning (or empty).   Taking this into consideration, the stem u- [aw-] appears unusual in that 
its exact meaning is less defined than other stems.   In Boas’ (1948) dictionary he defines u-
[a’w-]  as: 
                                                 
8 Phoneme: perceptually distinct sound sets in language used to create meaning and symbolized by letters 
in an orthography. 

79 
 
 
A stem designating an action, state, or noun which receives its specific meaning from 
the attached suffix.  Before consonantic suffixes it has the form u-.  It is the opposite 
of way-, the corresponding negative stem; for instance u’sta “to go right into water”; 
wi’sta “to fail to go into water” (pp. 27 & 32)    
 
The u-[a’w-] form lacks the content or obvious “meaning” generally provided by stems in 
Kwak’wala words.   For example, the verbal stem yaxw- meaning “to dance” by the attachment 
of suffixes can form yaxw-iwe’  “dancing headdress for forehead” or yaxw-a “ land looms up in 
distance (dances)” (p. 42).  In acting in opposition to the negative way- stem we might consider 
that the stem u-[aw-] partially takes on the meaning “to be”.  If one surveys the application of the 
u-[a’w] stem across word glosses a pattern begins to emerge of spatial or locative character   
The majority of u-[a’w-] verbal forms relate to some form of action through space, while the 
majority of u-[a’w-] noun forms relate to spatial location upon a type of object; these types of 
objects being limited to vessels such as bowls, boxes and canoes, animate bodies such as 
human and animal, houses, communities and the landscape.   The noun forms can be said to 
form categories and these categories act as analogies which emphasize some type of structural 

80 
 
 
similarity.   That the concept is significant enough to be encoded in the Kwak’wala language is 
significant.   
 
The most common form this morpheme takes is u- or alternatively a’w-  It appears as a’w-, aw-, 
and o- in Boas’ transcriptions.   These are allomorphs of the same morpheme.  Bauer (2004) 
defines an allomorph as “one of the realisations of a morpheme” (p.15).  For example, the plural 
form suffix in English can have the varients “cat-s” or “tax-es”.  Both –s and –es mean the same 
thing, “more than one”, but take different forms based on the sound of the proceeding 
consonants.   For the variant forms of the Kwak’wala u- the shifts in vowel quality are influenced 
by phonological conditions brought on by the first phoneme of the attached suffix.   When the 
introductory vowel form is e-, rather than being an allophone of u- I suspect that this is a 
reduplicated form indicating plurality or distribution.   
 
The following 13 sets are the classes of nouns formed with the stem u-[a’w-].  The types of 
nouns that are associated together can be said to form a type of class or radial category within 
Kwakwaka’wakw conceptualization.  For example, in Set 1 it can be proposed that the “bow of a 
canoe”, “the front of a house” and a forehead are conceptually analogous.   I have arranged the 

81 
 
 
sets in order of their suffix initial consonants.  While initially the words may appear to be 
unrelated in their English translation it is my theory that the formal relationships of shared 
phonology (letters) will reveal relationships specific to Kwakwaka’wakw underlying conceptual 
understructure that emerge as a radial category of associated meaning as illustrated in (Figure 
3.3).  
     
3.5.1 Example sets 1-13 of forms analogous to the body  
 
Set 1: u – g[w]iw- 
(1)     u –giwe                    “bow of canoe” (Boas 1948:30, Grubb 1977:216) 
                                        
(2)     u –gwi –we’              “forehead” (Boas 1948:30, Grubb 1977:216) 
              
(3)     u –gwi – wa -lil          “front of house (forehead of house)” (Grubb 1977:216) 
                                           “forehead of house,  9rear of house” (Boas 1948:30) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
9 This apparent discrepancy can be explained by points of orientation.   When perceived from the exterior 
the front of the house that faces the water is considered the head   Once inside the house the interior 
shifts to the perspective of the person who has entered.   The rear of the house then becomes the ‘head’ 
of the house. (Boas 1909:415)

Using the concept of radial categories each set could be configured as in (Figure 3.3).  The u-
[a’w-] stem provides the central meaning as a locative in conceptual relationship to the body as 
a prototype for spatial relationship.  If one applies Boas’ interpretation of the u-[a’w-] stem as “a 
stem designating an action, state or noun which receives its specific meaning from the attached 
suffix” (Boas 1948, p. 27) then this radial category can be interpreted as “a location on an object 
which is analogous to the forehead” i.e. ugiwe “the forehead of a canoe”, ugwiwalił  “the 
forehead of the house”, the ugwiwe’  “forehead of the human body.”   As all the example sets 
begin with the u-[a’w-] stem each of the sets are organized by the form of the initial consonants 
and their meanings compared as somehow analogous.  In (Figure 3.4) one can ask the question 
how is “the body imagined as a long object” similar to the “inside of a vessel” or the “bank of a 
        u- 
location “on body” 

83 
 
 
river”.  One could hypothesize that the inside of the vessel is referring to the upper portion of the 
interior of that vessel which is similar to the long thin embankment of a river bed which acts like 
a vessel, or long container for water in the landscape.  The peripheral aspect of position or 
location on the body is referred to in the terms for toes and roof which are also peripheral in the 
same way that the upper portion of the vessel is i.e.”near the edge of the main body of the 
river/riverbed”.  Also, one could say the river itself is imagined as a long body stretching across 
the landscape upon which are spatially peripheral features such as “toes”. “roof”, or “lower end 
of belly” or that an island is imagined as a long body with peripheral features such as the “east 
end of an island” or what could be referred to as the “head of the island”.  Example (5) is a 
place-name located on the narrow end of Cormorant Island.  Hence it is literally named the 
“head” of the body of Cormorant Island which is geographically shaped like a long kidney.

3.5.2 Independent forms 
 
The following u-[a’w-] forms are considered independent only because when sorting the u-[a’w-] 
forms according to the shared initial consonants of the initial attached suffix, these ones were 
single examples.  They are “independent” only in the sense that there were no other 
phonologically similar examples to pair them up with.  It does not indicate that other forms don’t 
exist only that they may not have been listed in Boas (1947).   What they do seem to share 
however, is that the majority of them have more than one glossed meaning.  For example (75) 
can mean “bank of river” or “side of vessel”.

The list of words prefaced with the onset stem u-[a’w-]  numbers approximately 136 in Boas 
(1948) dictionary.   83 of these are nouns which form the 13 sets I have compiled above.   It is a 
comprehensive list of words.  They are organized based on the initial consonants of the first 
suffix since the specific meaning of the word appears to be provided by the initial suffix and then 
modified by following suffixes.  The extended meaning of the spatial analogy of 
Body=House=Land is provided by the u-[a’w-] stem.  The majority of the 83 examples presented 
here refer to the body, the house, or the landscape with the odd one referring to a container or 
canoe.   
                                
 
3.5.3  Kwak’wala suffixes that reference the body  
The u-[a’w] stem is not the only form that can identify parts of the body.  An array of suffixes 
denoting body parts exists in conjunction.  These body part suffixes can be combined with 

93 
 
 
stems other than the u-[a’w] stem.   When this occurs, the more concrete meanings supplied by 
the stems combine with the suffix to supply more specific information.   The following list I have 
compiled from Boas (1947) list of suffixes.   It is most likely incomplete since the morphemes of 
the suffixes attaching to the u-[a’w-] stem are not all accounted for.  
   
Kwak’wala body-part suffixes (Boas 1947, pp. 229-232) 
Boas lists 24 suffixes in his “Kwakiutl Grammar with a Glossary of the suffixes that reference 
body parts.  The examples are bracketed as they represent the internal structure of the word 
and are not full words in and of themselves.  For example (98) is represented as (-xtła).  When 
attached to a stem this could appear as hanxtła  “on top of head [canoe is on top of waves or on 
island” or uxtła’ye “head of ‘naḿima”, or “top of head”, referring to the name which represents a 
position of social standing affiliated with the top of the head of the ‘naḿima body (Boas 1947, p. 
374).  
 
     (87)     ( -s’anal )                    “main part of an object, body house, canoe” 
     (88)     ( -‘stu )                        “round opening, eye”

     (98)     ( -xtla )                         “on top of head” 
     (99)     ( -xtlo )                         “top of tree, ends of branches, leaves, body hair”

(103)    ( -`a )                             “ear” 
     (104)    ( -[g]iu )                          “forehead” 
     (105)    ( -[g]it )                           “body as a whole”

     (110)    ( -[x]seka )                       “in front of house, of body” 
 
3.5.3.1  Word examples using body part suffixes 
The following is a small set of word examples where the stem plus the suffix(es) create more 
specific meaning through their combination.  I provide these examples to show that the specific 
meaning supplied by the u-[a’w-] stem is missing the obvious definition supplied by other stems. 
 
(111)    `tan – abedz -e’               “to have pains in calf” (Boas 1947:313)

     (119)     nak – axsta -’lis                 “middle(entrance) of bay” (Boas 1947:305) 
                  middle    mouth     of beach (land) 
 
     (120)     ‘na’l - anxe’                       “ farthest upriver, also most valuable, noblest” 
                        11 north     edge of flat or long thing                                                   (Boas 1947:305)

                   house       body of 
 
 
From the above sample set of stem + body part suffix forms we see it is possible to reference 
body parts without using the u-[a’w-] stem form.   It can be deduced then that the u-[a’w-] does 
not exist simply to express body parts but must perform a broader function that is connected to 
the conceptualization of structural cross-over between the body and certain utilitarian vessels, 
                                                 
11 This stem is glossed as north in many translations, however the definition is an approximation applied to 
extend western European cardinal directions onto Kwak’wala cardinal directions.   They are not the same.   
The literal meaning is ‘upriver’.

architecture, and the landscape, the categories which emerged when the nouns formed with u-
[a’w-] were sorted into sets 1-13.  
 
3.6  The stem u-[a’w-] in Kwakwaka’wakw geographical names  
The geographical terminology of the Kwakwaka’wakw, utilizes detail specific to geographic 
location, such as ‘naldze’  “upriver” and gwayi’  “downriver”,` tlasdze’  “seaside”, or ‘adlagamala  
“facing inland”.   Place-names tend to indicate either these positional notions or geographic 
character such as appearance; ‘awe’s  “foam beach” or utility; `kogwade’  “having shelter”.    
They can be combined or separate.   Occasionally names of a culturally significant nature are 
used such as madamxtala  “madam on top”, the madam being a dance belonging to the ’tseka, 
or winter ceremonial.   In Boas (1934) “Geographical Names of the Kwakiutl Indians” place 
names are listed according to the stem.   Several names may appear in variation under one 
stem category.   The place names beginning with the u-[a’w-] stem form one of the largest 
subsets.  Approximately, 60 place-names are listed as beginning with u-, while, approximately 
26 are listed under a’w- (pp. 44-46).  Approximately 40 of these place-names specifically 
reference the body.  Other significant subsets are names beginning with ‘makw-  “round thing is 
somewhere” and gwa- “downriver”.   Added to this can be the numerous place names that 

98 
 
 
incorporate body part suffixes.    Combined, it is feasible to say that amongst Kwakwaka’wakw 
geographical place names the association of the landscape with the animate body is a viable 
component. 
 
Examples of place names prefaced with (u-), (aw-) that reference the body

                     cheek

3.6.1  Body part suffixes used in geographical names (Boas 1934, pp. 15-17) 
Many body part suffixes are used in Kwakwaka’wakw geographical names.  The place-names 
using the u-[a’w-] stem can be found on pp. 44-46 in Boas’ (1934) “Geographical Names of the 
Kwakiutl Indians.”   Boas says: 
 
Geographical terminology does not depend solely upon cultural interests, but is also 
influenced by linguistic structure.  Kwakiutl has a very large number of suffixes 
expressing location and similar concepts.  Many of these appear in the geographic 
terminology and the concepts expressed by these suffixes limit the range of names 
that can be expressed by single words.  I give here a number of examples of 
suffixes which will indicate the range of concepts that find expression. (p. 14) 
 
Boas then lists 61 suffixes present within geographical names.   Out of these 61 suffixes, 
approximately 40 reference the body.   About 20 of the 40 suffixes Boas lists, already appear 
under section 4.3  “Kwak’wala suffixes that reference the body” which were compiled from Boas 
(1947) “Kwakiutl Grammar with a Glossary of the Suffixes”. The following suffixes are the ones 
not listed in Boas (1947) but present in Boas (1934) pp. 14-18.   Together with the suffixes listed 

100 
 
 
under section 4.3, they total approximately forty-four suffixes used in place-names that directly 
refer to the body.  That approximately 66%, or 2 out of every 3, suffixes used in geographical 
place-names has a reference to the body indicates that the conceptual connection between the 
body and the landscape is a pervasive one.

The analogy of the body onto small-scale objects such as boxes and bowls, medium scale 
objects such as canoes and houses and ultimately the landscape is a conceptual theme that is 
given expression through linguistic form in the Kwak’wala language.   The form u-[a’w-], while it 
may appear on first inspection to be an empty morpheme because it lacks the specific definition 
of other stems, actually acts as a classifier grouping the noun suffixes it attaches to as a  
category.   In Kwakwaka’wakw conceptualization this category is important enough to be 
marked.   Adding to the significance of this concept in the Kwak’wala language is the large 
group of suffixes that in describing locations in relationship to objects, either ‘on’, or ‘in’ or as ‘a 
part of’ use body part references.   Ultimately, this concept is further manifest in geographic 
names, of which, a significant portion use the idea of the body as a locative or descriptive. 
  
3.7 Other forms: the object as a container, the body as a container 
 
Though landscape terminology and house-forms have been focused on up to now, there are 
other structures that reflect the extension of the body as a primary spatial conceptualization that 
uses analogy to imagine spatial relationships that are represented in the u-[a’w-] stem corpus.   
It is the graphic and linguistic application of this concept onto canoes, bowls and boxes that 

103 
 
 
deepens the application beyond the large-scale of the house and the landscape to include the 
small-scale. 
 
3.7.1 Canoes 
Canoes, in particular, carry linguistic terminology descriptive of the body.   Like, houses, they 
also carry names.   They are conceptualized as having a front (bow) and a rear (stern).   When 
setting about to build a canoe the canoe builder would send out a series of prayers in 
recognition that the tree from which the canoe was to be created from was a living being.   While 
he falls the tree he prays, “Do not fall too heavily, else you, great magician, will be broken.” 
(Boas 1909, p. 344).  (Figure 3.5) is a diagram of a canoe and the associated names for its 
parts.   Of particular interest are numbers 8, 10, 18, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 33, which are 
prefaced by the u-[a’w-] stem.

The paintings on canoes imply animation.  The canoe is considered a living thing rendered from 
a living tree.   Kwakwaka’wakw mythology is filled with references to canoes that can move on 
their own through supernatural means.  In (Figure 3.6) the canoe is painted with one side of the 
sisi’utł  “the double headed sea serpent”.    
  
Then Only-One-On-Beach came in.  Then he spoke, and said, “Oh brother! Now 
come and look at your canoe.  I will advise you what to do with the canoe.”  Then 
Head-Winter-Dancer went out of the house of Only-One-On-The-Beach.  As soon as 
he had gone out, he saw at both ends the large double headed serpents putting out 
their tongues, and in the middle there was the head of a man.  Then they walked 
down to the beach, to where the Paddleside-Serpent-Canoe was.  The Only-One-
On-Beach got into it, and he called Head-Winter-Dancer to go aboard also.  Then he 
said, “Oh brother! Now listen to how I speak to the death bringing Paddleside-

106 
 
 
Serpent-Canoe, for that is its name.”  Then he said, “Go, now paddle!”  Then the 
body of the canoe said “Wo!” as though many men were crying that way.   Then all 
the paddles paddled, and it started at once, really going fast, for indeed it was not a 
common thing. (Boas, 1902, p. 202)

3.7.2  Bowls & feast dishes   
Bowls and lukwala  “dishes” were used in the ceremonial distribution of food.   These bowls 
often were elaborate and usually depicted an animate being whose body cavity became the 
container for food.   Food was presented in the larger dishes and distributed in the smaller 
dishes to small groups of people to eat from.   Figure 3.7 is a staged photo by Edward Curtis 
that depicts a giant feast dish in the form of a sisi’utł “double headed serpent” in the foreground.

Feast dishes were part of the inherited rights of the gigami’ “head chief” of a ‘na’mima “ house 
group”.   A house was said to carry the rights to four feast dishes.   The status of these types of 
dishes is made clear in an account of a chief who had the rights to four feast dishes and had 
them carved into a ḱiḱw “totem pole”.   It was said that the second figure from the bottom was 
placed upside-down because the dish was in the back of the man while all the others were in 
the bellies (Boas 1911, p. 379)    Ordinary everyday bowls and dishes are less elaborate.   It is 
difficult to ascertain whether differences existed in the linguistic application of components from 
feast dishes to everyday dishes as less information has been documented than in the case of 
houses and canoes.12   Two examples of the u-[a’w-] stem related to bowls/dishes are 
uxwsgiwe’   “short end of dish” “shoulder?, nom.”(Boas 1948:31) and u’gwage’  “bank of river, 
side of vessel” (Boas 1947:352).  Figure 3.8 shows another example of a feast dish in the form 
of a reclined Dzunukwa (Wild Woman of the Woods) at a potlatch in Alert Bay taken in the early 
part of the 1900s.   Note the massive dimensions of these dishes.   Not all dishes were this 
large but many were meant to be impressive and monumental in their presentation as a positive 
reflection on the prestige of the host. 
                                                 
12 This is not to say that the information does not exist but rather that I have yet to come across it so far in 
my review of materials.

3.7.3  Boxes/Chests 
The u-[a’w-] stem has been found applied to box/chest terminology.  Two example are u`kwe’i                     
“top of pile, box” (Boas 1948:30a) and u’dzaxs  “canoe box” (Boas 1948:30). Boas’ 
documentation of canoe terminology that use of the u-[a’w-] stem is substantial I suspect this is 
because he specifically asked George Hunt to elicit these terms for him.  It is unfortunate that 
the terminology of bowls, dishes, boxes and chests were not documented as comprehensively 
since I suspect more terms using the u-[a’w-] stem would be have been recorded.   This was 
such specialized terminology that it would be difficult to elicit from contemporary speakers 
today. 
 
The xatsam, galdas or ḱawaťsi  “boxes and chests” used by the Kwakwaka’wakw as well as the 
tribes to the north were elaborate and animate.   The structure of the formal images applied to 
the outer surfaces of Kwakwaka’wakw boxes have been influenced by the north.   On chests a 
variance on a generalized image of a being with a broad face and eyes forms the central 
composition on the front.   In the corners appear joints and ears, head feathers, hands, and 
stylistic conventions fill the rest of the space.   Smaller boxes had more flexible regulations for 
imagery and ranged from a similar generalized facial composition to pure abstraction of formal 

111 
 
 
elements.   The similarity to northern house-fronts is demonstrated by comparison of the chests 
(Figure 3.9) with the version of John Scow’s northern style Raven House in (Figure 3.1).

Carved bentwood chests were the specialty of the tribes north of the southern Kwakwaka’wakw, 
the Haida particularly were skilled at making these objects and they were traded for up and 
down the coast.   Figure 3.10 depicts a Kwakwaka’wakw interpretation from Kingcome Inlet.

Figure 3.11 and Figure 3.12 depict a smaller type of bentwood box.  Note the frontal animate 
face which often decorated these boxes.  An intriguing movement in the latter part of the 19th 
century saw the development of an abstract style which broke away from this more standard 
depiction. (McLennan and Duffek, 2000)

Boxes and chests are containers for all types of articles.   Of primary consideration, are the 
dlugwe “treasures” affiliated with ceremonial practice.   This function in particular is extended as 
a metaphor.   The ‘box’ of a family group chief is said to hold all of the songs, dances and 
positions of the ‘house’.   In Walens (1977) study of Kwakwaka’wakw metaphor he considers 
the ‘box’ to be the primary metaphor in cultural conceptualization. 

114 
 
 
The structural characteristics of boxes as containers – with walls, an internal space, 
decoration on the walls and lids – repeat again and again throughout all Kwakiutl 
life.   Houses, bodies, costumes and masks, world levels, lineages, numayms and 
villages, animal species, names and souls, months and days, cradleboards and 
sites, dishes, storage containers, canoes, fishing weirs, and many other items of 
Kwakiutl culture are visualized and interpreted as though they were boxes or parts 
of boxes.   Different items can be so similarly boxlike as to seem merely variations 
on a single visual template (Walens p. 51) 
 
I believe the observations made by Walens to be mostly accurate except that linguistic analysis 
reveals that the emphasis lies more with the body and that the box itself is simply an extension 
of this.   This would appear to be verified by the combined linguistic applications of the u-[a’w-] 
morpheme and the large variety of suffixes that are extensions of the animate body.   It is the 
body  which is extended to the house, which is then extended to the landscape that serves as 
the prototype for the primary metaphor in Kwakwaka’wakw cosmology.

3.8 Summary 
This chapter has examined one component of spatial conceptualization in the Kwak’wala 
language that appears to emphasize the extension of the animate body onto both small-scale 
and large-scale objects.   This concept in the Kwak’wala language is marked by the stem 
morpheme u-[a’w-] that, when attached to suffixes, renders words that can be categorized as 
bearing structural similarity.   These words relate objects such as bowls, boxes, canoes, houses 
and the landscape to the animate body.   Facilitators of further extension are a vast array of 
suffixes that are directly related to the body and can be applied to stems other than the u-[a’w-] 
stem.   Combined, these forms in the Kwak’wala language create a large enough corpus to 
consider the concept of spatial extension of the animate body as a prototype for architecture 
and the landscape as a pervasive component of Kwakwaka’wakw thought.   In addition to the 
linguistic applications are architectural and artistic expressions that express this notion visually.     
Canoes, bowls and boxes also visually manifest this concept in their formal compositions and 
the naming of their parts.   Ultimately, on the grandest scale this concept is prevalent in the 
naming of the landscape.  The u-[a’w-] stem form in the Kwak’wala language reflects the 
Body=House=Land/World metaphor which emerges as a major concept in Kwakwaka’wakw 
culture.  In Kwakwaka’wakw conceptualization it can be said “the house is a body” and “the land 

116 
 
 
is a body”. Conceptualized this way both houses and the landscape are animate, alive and can 
be characterized in humanistic ways.  Figure 3.13 shows the relationships of the 
Body=House=Land/World metaphor.

The u-[a’w-] stem acts as a classifier between the body, the house and the land and is encoded 
linguistically in the Kwak’wala language.   The form represents a significant concept which is 
reflected in Kwakwaka’wakw culture and can be taken as an indication that in this case, 
language and culture are intrinsically linked on the conceptual level.  The next chapter will 
present spatial terminology and concepts in relationship most closely associated with the body.

“ Haha hanani!  Now I come to think of my forefathers and of my great-grandfathers.  Now 
I will tell the story of my house when we were chiefs in the beginning of this our world”

4.1 Kwak’wala Pronouns 
This chapter outlines the Kwakwaka’wakw spatial relationship to the body as expressed in the 
Kwak’wala language.  The body is associated with the self and exists in spatial relationship with 
others.  In English, terms like I, you, he, she, and it indicate relationships to the speaker (or 
self). I is the central expression closest to the body; you is referring to the person spoken to 
which is outside of the self, he, she, and it are one step further removed. These terms are called 
personal pronouns.  Demonstrative pronouns in English like this and that also express notions 
of spatial distance from the body/self as a central orientation. 
I begin by looking at Kwak’wala suffixes which express the pronouns I, you, he, she, it  and their 
relationships within space, and then engage with the demonstrative forms ga-, yu-, he- and their 

118 
 
 
extended application in constructing space both literal and imaginative. In Kwak’wala, pronouns 
are marked by suffixes which attach to verbal stems (an action word).  Out of the pronouns 
expressed in  Kwak’wala speech the most spatially marked  is he/she/it  which is divided into 
two forms: -uxw “he/she/it [around]” and –i  “he/she/it [further away/away]”   Figure 4.1 
represents the Kwak’wala pronouns –an “I”, -as “you”, -uxw  “he/she/it “[around] and –i  
“he/she/it” [further away/away] as a gradual movement away from the speaker who is 
considered central.

 Pronouns are what identify the self and others in relationship to one another.  In order to 
consider the concept of the personal pronoun as a spatial one consider the idea of “I”, or 
“myself” as the central subject.   Kwak’wala uses a suffix which attaches to a stem in order to 
identify the subject (person being talked about).  Similar to English there exists an “I” identifier, 
called first person and a “you” identifier, called second person.   Third person is where English 
and Kwak’wala diverge.  Where English utilises “he/she/it” as identifying the third person, 
Kwak’wala does not divide by gender but by distance/proximity.  This has in some Kwak’wala 
texts been translated as a “here/absent”, “visible/invisible” differentiation (U’mista, 1981; Boas, 
1947).  
  
Boas describes 1st person as “the speaker”, the 2nd person as “the person or persons 
addressed” and the 3rd person as “person or persons spoken of.” (p.251)  Within these 
definitions there is the implicit relationship of space with “I” as the speaker being central, “you” 
as spoken to as nearest in relationship and “he/she/it” being one step removed.  Kwak’wala 
divides an ambiguous 3rd person into a more explicit spatial relationship.  3rd person becomes, 
3rd person (present/around) and 3rd person (away/absent).   Figure 4.2 compares English and 
Kwak’wala pronouns I, you, he/she/it in relationship to degrees of space.

13 -uxw is the underlying form of this suffix.  Sometimes due to phonological reasons the “w” is eroded and 
the surface form becomes –ux[w]. 
14 This suffix appears as both –i and as –i’ (with a glottal stop).  Boas 1947:260 indicates that the 
differentiation was based on the concept of visibility –i (the subject was away but still visible) and invisibility –
i’ (the subject is invisible.)  This delineation is not so clearly marked in modern Kwak’wala speech and in the 
U’mista texts the –i or –i’ differentiation appears indiscriminate (U’mista, 1981, Book 7) .  It may be that 
further research is required to define the underlying reason for this.

In English the single 3rd person is less specific than the divided 3rd person in Kwak’wala which  
marks a type of spatial relationship between subjects.  This marking is extended into other 
domains where the concepts of presence and absence are further delineated.  For example, a 
residual effect appears to exist in narrative where names ending with the consonant “d” are 
marked with the –i’ (absent) suffix denoting the subject which while being discussed is considered 
absent.

                 (Boas 1910, pp. 82-83) 
 
Kwak’wala divides the pronoun “we” into an inclusive and exclusive form.  Figure 4.3 represents 
the inclusive form –an’s “I and you”. While Figure 4.4 represents the exclusive form –anu’xw  “I 
and he/she/it, but not you”.

In the exclusive –anu’xw , excluding person being addressed  “we, I and he/she/it but not you” 
it appears that the pronouns –an “I” and –uxw  “he/she/it [present] join to form –anu’xw . 
  
The plural forms of the pronouns “you” and “he/she/it” are:

To form plurals –axda’xw- is suffixed by the pronouns –as “you”, -uxw “he/she/it (present) and –i’ 
“he/she/it (absent).  Boas (1947) gives a much more comprehensive and elaborate breakdown

(but not you) 

124 
 
 
of the spatial relationships between “speaker”,”spoken to” and “spoken of” in the Kwak’wala 
language with more specific degrees of spatial location of whom or what is being referred to.  In 
a 1932 paper on Kwak’wala language change he observes:   
 
Perhaps the most striking change in usage is found in the new development of the 
demonstrative pronoun.  The older generation use six demonstrative forms, one each 
for position near speaker, near person addressed, near person spoken of, each 
divided into two forms, visible and invisible. (Boas,1932, p. 90) 
 
The definite issue of visibility and invisibility has proven problematic in modern language 
acquisition as the specificity of the prior system has changed.  Visibility and presence and 
absence are not necessarily the same thing, though there is of course cross-over as to whether 
a subject/object is present and therefore visible or absent and therefore invisible.  For my 
purposes here the division of visible/invisible is dropped for the preferred and more accurate 
though generalized “present/nearby” and “absent/away” definitions which are more in line with 
contemporary speech.  There still exists some nuanced variation in the “absent/away” category 
as it can also encompass the concept “further away while still in the vicinity”.    

125 
 
 
Kwak’wala has a complex and sophisticated demonstrative pronoun system.  These pronouns 
are sometimes called determiners.  Determiners are words like “the, this and that”, in the English 
language.  They help “determine” what or who is being talked about.  The modern manifestation 
of this system in Kwak’wala has changed somewhat from the system that Boas was analyzing at 
the beginning of the last century.  For my purposes, I will address the spatial relationships as 
they are defined today and stick to broad outlines.  I will also focus only on the certain features 
of this system which are specific to my analysis of spatial relationship in the context of this 
thesis.     
 
The Kwak’wala system is more explicit in defining spatial relationships between speaker, 
subject and object than English with three required delineations of speaker to subject/object in 
space; “right here”, “around” and “further away/removed”.   Such definition makes sense for an 
oral culture heavily reliant on the spoken word for accurate transmission of information.  It also 
makes sense that with the growing influence of English, which lacks such specificity in spatial 
relationship, that the details of this sophisticated system would prove difficult for second 
language acquisition of Kwak’wala.  The main reason I mention this here is to give at least an 

126 
 
 
impression of the internal visual mapping of events that would occur within the imagination 
given such specificity.   
 
Additional research into determiners was conducted with linguist Adam Werle and a more 
comprehensive analysis of this topic was compiled into a 2009 unpublished report, An 
Investigation of Modern Kwak’wala determiner systems.   Our research led us to believe that the 
underlying concepts behind the divided third person is one of vicinity, a presence and absence 
which we translated as “around” or “not around” which is still retained in the contemporary 
Kwak’wala third person.  The definition is a spatial one.  “He/she or it” is referred to as being 
within the vicinity of the discussion or outside of it, either –uxw  “around” or –i’  “not around”. 
 
4.2 “Here and there”  Degrees of personal distance  ga-, yu-, he- 
In a more direct engagement with spatial relationship of subject/object, Kwak’wala employs a 
system of referential word initial verbal stems that indicate spatial relationship regarding the 3rd 
person “this” or “that”, “who” or “what” a sentence is about.  They are, in order of degree of 
distance, ga-, yu-, and he-.  Ga-15 can be loosely translated as meaning “this, in close physical 
                                                 
15 Sometimes pronounced ge-  

127 
 
 
proximity, or right here”.  Yu- can be translated as “that”, in proximate distance (around), and 
he- can be translated as “that”, which is away from here (not around). 
   
(175)     ga-                “this”     gada  “this one”      ga’sta   “these” (all around) [Boas 1948:252] 
              ya- (yu-)       “this” (near 2nd person, see demonstrative pronouns in grammar) [p. 39] 
              he-  (1)         “that, (2) in a straight direction to a distant point” (p. 97-99) 
 
 
These are also correlated to 1st person, 2nd person and 3rd person (Boas 1948:258) 
(176)     ga-                “this”     (near 1st Person) 
             ya- (yu-)        “this”  (near 2nd person) 
  
             he-                (1) “that, (near 3rd person) 
 
While taking into account the above definitions identified by Boas, the actual application of these 
spatial relationships are somewhat more fluid and the concept of “around” or “not around” can 
expand and contract its boundary according to context.   In other words, what is considered to be 
“around” or “not around” expands or contracts according to what is being talked about.   The 
following sentences give an idea of the proximal relationships of ga-, yu-, and he-.  The stem ga- is 

128 
 
 
often accompanied by the nominal proceeding word gada which is formed by the spatial referent ga- 
+ the definitive or specific –da which can be translated as loosely as “the.”  The following examples 
were elicited from and cross referenced with two contemporary Kwak’wala speakers. 
 
(177)      Ge’man ump gada.     “This is my father. [right here, beside the speaker](05/11/12)        
                     this   my   father  here specific       
       
(178)      Yu’man umpuxwda.     “This is my father. [near person being spoken to](05/11/12) 
                      this  my  father-3rd person (near) specific 
 
 
(179)      He’man umpida.           “That is my father.” [further away but still visible](05/11/12)

The next set of examples are taken from “Kwak’walala gaxan: Speak Kwak’wala to me”

                 this   I am       at/here     house his    Tom 
 
When we consider the above examples we see that the location of the speaker/subject in 
relationship to space is always “nearby” or “close”.  The shirt referred to is “right here”.  Your 
father referred to is “right here”.  I am located “right here”.  I “right here” is located in the bedroom.   
I am “in” Tom’s house.   This spatial closeness is not fixed however but can be contextual as 
exemplified in the following sentence which describes the geography in relationship to “right 
here”.   Ga- is translated as proximate to the body regardless of how large the stage or context of 
the setting is.  This is an integral concept to this entire chapter; the delineation of spatial 
relationship is contextual not fixed.  The relationship of what is considered “near” and “away from” 
while anchored to the body are understood in relationship to the stage or context of the situation.  
This has relativity to broader cultural understandings which will be addressed further on. 
(192)    Gadiganu’xw  atłiga’      “This is what is inland from us.” (Boas 1947:258) 
             this is near us       inland here 
 

132 
 
 
The relation of proximity regarding the subject is defined by “nearby, close, in, or on” is also 
evident in some other related stems.   
 
4.3.1 Related stems: Boas 1948, pp. 252-255  gay-,gax- 
The stems, gay- “to be somewhere”, gax- “to come”, and gay(a)-, gax’id   “to move from a certain 
place, to come from” have a relationship both formally and conceptually to the base form ga-. The 
basic premise is spatial orientation of the centre to the subject and these words begin to give a 
general notion of how this relationship is conceived of and then expressed in the language.   They 
can be said to form a conceptual paradigm.  
 
gay-  “to be somewhere” (Boas 1948, p. 246)  
The definition refers to something that is located in a place.  It could be translated as somewhat 
equivalent to the English spatial locatives “in” or “on”.  If something is “on” or “in” something else 
the relationship is one of closeness.  The base form gay- can change form based on the 
phonological relationship of the attached suffix.  In the following examples gay- is the base form 
that shifts to gi-, and ga’-.

(193)    gix’id    “to put down”18  
(194)    ga’es    “to stay in an indian village (=on beach)

(197)    ga’yas     “place where something is” 
 
gax- “to come”.  (Boas 1948, p. 254) 
Another related stem which refers to the proximate relationship of things in combination with 
movement is gax- “to come”.  While referring to movement the movement is defined as heading 
towards the subject.  While gay-  “to be somewhere” (Boas 1948:246) refers to stationary close 
proximate relationships, gax- “to come” adds motion and direction but is related due to the 
concept of close relationship or proximity.

4.3.2  La- ,gax- , degrees of closeness and movement (away & towards) 
In order to better understand gax- we should briefly consider its opposite in motion the auxiliary 
verbal stem la- .  This stem is literally translated as “to go”, meaning motion away or sequential 
movement.  Berman (1991) translates la- as meaning “movement onward on the narrative 
journey through time and space”(p. 372). 
 
         The second and third persons indirect object are always formed from la-, because 
the motion is away from the speaker. (Boas 1947, p. 287) La’man na’nakwexsta.      
“I desire to go home.” La’la’e ḱwagałe umpas. “Then, it is said, his father cried.”          
         Nevertheless the feeling persists that la- means a motion away from, 
         gax- a motion toward the speaker. (Boas 1947, p. 287) 

136 
 
 
In the first sentence example below the idea literally expresses the meaning “go”.  In the second 
example the meaning is more general indicating that the action is sequential, or one could say 
figuratively the action is “on-go-ing”.   Examples (207) and (208) are literal examples of the 
meaning “go”, while the next two have a more general function of implying events as ongoing. 
 
(207)    La’man latł dux’widtłaxan ‘namwut.     “I’ll go and see my brother.” (Boas 1947:287) 
                 go         I      go FT     to see  FT    my    brother

In Figure 4.6 la- represents “movement away from the centre of focus (subject/object), while gax- 
represents movement towards the centre of focus (subject/object).  The following three examples 
(211), (212) and (213) are interesting combinations of the expressing motion and proximity 
 in both time and space.

While gax- “to come” renders a relationship of close proximity through “movement closer”, or 
“coming towards” the center of origin, the stem gay- “to come from, or descend from”, while 
closely associated posits the spatial relationship in a more historical, cultural conceptualization. 
Gay- expands the notion of close proximity to the centre to notions of ancestry which are 
considered central.  Embedded in its meaning are culturally weighted notions of descent…or

literally “where one comes from” as in the following examples.  The primary shift is that the focus 
has now shifted from proximity to the speech event to a more generalized historical concept of 
proximity; a proximity which is particular to the Kwakwaka’wakw in their association and 
contextualization of the past.  Again, the unifying concept expressed by the stem ga- is 
“closeness in proximity.”  In this case the proximate relationship is created by shifting focus from a 
literal space to an imagined one where the ‘self’ or 1st person is situated at the site of origin.  This 
relationship is illustrated in Figure 4.7.

you walk” and gadzakwa  “to walk from there, the road you take” are metaphors for the imitation 
of one’s ancestors; the road being the precedent that they have set which one seeks to imitate or 
“follow.”  Finally, ga’gali’laťsi  “place, from which one comes in house, house in which winter 
ceremonial is held [Nak]20” is a word embedded with cultural symbolism.  The ceremonial house is 
a symbolic representation of the universe in space and time.  The act of entering the ceremonial 
house is analogous to the act of original ancestors arriving in the land at the beginning of time.  
The stem is an anchoring or “point of origin” to the past which replicates spatial relationship in 
ways of thinking about relationships.  This crossover between ideas of space and the past leads 
into the next topic.  
 
4.3.3  Temporal Relationship –ga &gal- space &time moving out from the centre as the 
“point of origin” 
 
 A temporal (time based) example of particular interest is the command suffix –ga.  This suffix 
attaches to action verbs as an imperative.  It renders a sense of urgency that can be translated to 
                                                 
19 Boas had this word written with a “g”.  When cross-referenced with a contemporary Kwak’wala speaker 
the word reads more like the word meaning “eyes”.  I suspect a spelling error as the stem form for “to walk” 
in Kwak’wala is kasa (personal communication 11/12) 
20 [Nak] means the word is specific to the ‘Naḱwax’da’xw tribe 

141 
 
 
 mean “now!”  Boas (1947) explains: 
 
         An imperative demanding immediate action is expressed by the suffix ga’, 
presumably identical with the demonstrative ga’ expressing  “present invisible.”  
Since it implies the immediate starting of an action it is almost regularly attached to 
inchoative forms with following a as under the forms 2. (p. 266) 
 
In order to understand this better let us consider the following forms.  The first set exemplifies 
regular requests, while the second set includes the imperative command suffix -ga. 
 
(223)        dłaxw’i             “stand up”                      duxw’id      “look”                 (25/07/11) 
(224)        dłaxw’idaga’     “stand up!”                     duxw’idaga’     “look!”         (25/07/11) 
                       stand up     now!                                                          look               now! 
 
  
I propose that if we consider the formal use of the morpheme (ga) whether acting as a stem or 
suffix signifier that the common denominator is proximity.  In the stem form ga- denotes close 
proximity in space while the imperative command suffix –ga denotes close proximity in time.  
“Do it now!” 

142 
 
 
From these examples one can see that history or temporal flow is also marked by ga- indicating 
“point of origin”.  In everyday talk the point of origin is the speaker or subject on a space 
continuum where focus is on the present and the proximate relationship is related to the speech 
event.  Under broader temporal conditions where ga- marks the “point of origin” as “the 
beginning” the point of focus shifts away from speech event anchored in the present and 
focuses on the broader historic culturally embedded notions, of the “point of origin.”  
 
The following narratives give cultural context to the idea of “origin”.  They are followed by a 
description of words that are created from the stem gal-[gal-] “the beginning”, an extension off 
the stem ga- .   Culturally, for the Kwakwaka’wakw the historical/temporal point of origin is 
where original ancestors “arrive” or “come down” to establish themselves in the land.  Amongst 
the Dzawada’enuxw, this is marked by the arrival of the original ancestors Kawadilikala and 
Kwalili, who arrive in the form of wolves, with their families in the upper Kingcome Watershed 
and are transformed into humans:  
  
        The first man of the Tsawatenok was Kawatilikalla, but before he was a man he 
was a wolf.  They lived on the upper course of Kingcome River [at the head of 

143 
 
 
Kingcome Inlet].  One day a heavy rain was falling and he said: “I do not see why 
we should remain animals.  We had better leave off these skins and use them only 
in dancing.  Why should we wander about and have no home?  If we had a house 
to live in when it rains, it would be well.  His wife agreed, so they put off their skins 
and laid them away. (Curtis 1915, p.133) 
 
Another version of this narrative was recorded by the anthropologist Ronald Rohner in the 1960’s: 
         Qawadeilakala with his four children and his younger brother Koleili lived before 
there was light on the earth.  They heard the voice of God who said that they were 
to go and find a place which they could claim as their own.  The voice promised 
them the cloak of the wolf for ease of transportation [i.e., transformed them into 
wolves].  The two brothers and four children came first to Kingcome.  The older 
brother claimed lalaq, a site up Kingcome River as his own.  Koleili did not want to 
share the same site as his brother, so he moved on to look for his own place.  He 
travelled to lax’oh “clear-water” and then to Wakeman River. (Rohner 1970, p. 86) 
 
For another example from another tribe we can consider an origin story of the Kwikwasuťinuxw, 

144 
 
 
 a  brother tribe to the Dzawada’enuxw: 
 
         The first Koeksotenok man came from a cedar tree.  His name was Hawilqwolas, 
‘one who comes from a cedar’ (from wilEq, ‘cedar tree’).  Later in life he changed 
his name to Ts’eiqami (Tseikami), ‘Supreme.’  He survived the flood or the 
deluge…Tseikami had several daughters, one of whom was Tseikeisilax.  After his 
trials with Transformer, Tseikami returned to Mitap, Viner Sound.  He had his 
daughters with him.  Qolus, ‘Thunder-bird,’ was up on the mountain and, looking 
down, saw Tseikami’s fair daughters.  He liked their looks and descended from the 
mountain.  After making his face human by removing the Thunder-bird headpiece, 
he sang a song before Tseikami.  He asked Tseikami’s permission to marry one of 
his daughters and was granted permission.  Qolus then removed the Thunderbird 
cloak from himself and commanded it back to the mountain.  He then became fully 
human.  It is from the union of Qolus and one of Tseikami’s daughters that the 
Koeksotenok descended. (Rohner, 1964 p. 47-48)

These stories are of particular significance. They mark the beginnings, the origins of the first 
people in the land.  The origin stories, called ‘nu’yam, reflect a pattern of arrival, transformation 
and establishment in a land base or geographic location.  This is the ‘point of origin’ for history 
and for time.  The first narrative example explicitly states that this was before there was “light on 
the earth.”   Other related words are; galagawe “in the front, in the lead, first” , galagawe’tłas “you 
will be the first”, galusťakasu’   “first man to receive potlatch gift” (www.firstvoices.com).  Amongst 
the Kwakwaka’wakw the concept of the original (the first) and primogeniture are tightly bound in 
cultural practice.  Rights and prerogatives such as names, songs and dances are passed from the 
original ancestors down to descendants ideally through the oldest to the oldest to the oldest.  
What is considered the oldest and the most closely connected to the source of origin is most 
valued.   
 
In all speeches reference is made to the adherence of old customs.  They “walk the 
road made by the creator of chiefs” (kasa lax ťaxalasa  gigamegila R790.62) ; they 
walk in “that what results as the groove of the world” (xwalťalidzam R789:25).  The 
chief says, “I follow the road made by my late ancestors” (lan nagałtawix 
ťaxila’yasan wiwump’woła CIII 124.22) ; or “what is laid down by our ancestors” 

146 
 
 
(ḱata’yasants galamgalisa CIII 146:10).  Progress in social rank is “walking along on 
flat (blankets)” (kadzo CIII 130:22), or “walking along” (kaŉakwala R791:71).  
Customs are also called “the support of the tribe” (kadad CIII 884.10). (Boas 1940, 
p. 238) 
 
Gagatła’las “to go along from beginning to end” is also a metaphorical reflection of the concept 
of generational descent anchored by the original ancestor and occupation of the land to 
contemporary times.  Gayutł  “where you come from” refers to your descent, “where you come 
from”.  Ga’gali’laťsi  “place, from which one comes in house, house in which winter ceremonial 
is held [Nak]”  becomes the symbolic re-enactment of descent.  The Kwakwaka’wakw winter 
house is a ceremonial microcosm of the universe both in space and in time.  The literal “place 
from which one comes into the house” is a ceremonial metaphor for where one comes from in 
life, through one’s parents into the world, and one’s parents, through their parents and on and 
on back to the original source, the original ancestor, which is then re-enacted through symbolic 
ceremonialism.  In the order of precedence for potlatch gift giveaway the highest ranked 
persons are given their gifts first.  The closer in line you are to the original ancestors through 
descent the higher in social rank you will be; this explains the word galusťakasu’  “first man to 

147 
 
 
receive potlatch gift”, as it is the highest in rank who ceremonially receive their gifts first.  Let’s 
consider also the next example meaning “first”: 
 
gal- (before vowels)  gal-  (before consonants)  “first” (Boas 1948, p. 255) 
                                         
(225)     galdzas            “belonging to olden times” 
(226)     galdza’yala       “sound (song) of olden times” 
(227)     galdzakwa        “to speak first” 
(228)     galdzakwalis     “first one to speak in olden times” 
(229)     galgila              “to make first things, to institute”  
(230)     galnukw           “belonging to ancient times” 
(231)     galamgalis      “first in world, i.e. first ancestor” 
(232)     gaxgila’eł         “ancestors” 
(233)     gali’                “former one, ancestor” 
(234)     gagile’             “first ones” 

148 
 
 
(235)     galaxalis         “ancestors” 
(236)     galsgamlił       “beginning (of time beating) 
 
galgila (gal- “first”; -gila “to make”) “to make things first”.  This word has a relationship to “the 
beginning” as events occur first in the beginning of time.  This word refers to how things were 
instituted in the land by the original ancestors for the Kwakwaka’wakw.  Descendants are to 
imitate the ancestors.   Galdzas  “belonging to olden times” refers to that which is ancient.  In 
the following contemporary sentence the word denotes the object as old and valuable. 
 
 (237) ‘Walasuxw galdzasus ťikwaxawe’    “Your necklace is an antique.” (08/11/12) 
                 great      this/it     old/valuable your    necklace 
 
A closely related word is galdas which can be referred to as a chest where dance masks and 
regalia are kept.  The dance masks and regalia are used to symbolically re-enact ancient  
events.  Ideally, the objects are old and have been handed down through generations.  The 
word galdas (gal- “first” + -as “place for”) gives the meaning of the chest as “place for things that 
come from the beginning or ancient times.”   Gaxgila’eł (gax- “come” + -gila- “to make” + -eł “in 
the house” can be literally translated as “coming to make in the house” which ancestors do 

149 
 
 
when they come into the world to inhabit it historically and figuratively this is imitated by 
descendants ritually in the ceremonial house.  A contemporary Kwak’wala speaker translates 
this word as “coming to enter” and agrees it can refer to ancestors.  This speaker also gives the 
following example: 
 
(238) He’mo’łe galgalis si Kawadilikala .      “Kawadilakala was the first in the land.” (08/11/12) 
 
The words, galnukw  “belonging to ancient times”, galamgalis “first in world, i.e. first ancestor”, 
gaxgila’eł  “ancestors”, gale’  “former one, ancestor”, gagile’  “first ones”, galaxalis  “ancestors” 
are all self-evident.   Finally, let us consider the last example galsgamlił, which is translated in 
Boas’ 1948 dictionary literally as a verb, “beginning (of time beating)” but exists also as a noun; 
the name of a ceremony whose name is derived from an aspect of its action.  It is significant 
that this ceremony is conducted at the beginning of the winter ceremonial (ťseka).  The following 
is a description recorded in Curtis (1915). 
 

150 
 
 
         A peculiar pantomime in which none of the regular dancers appears is called 
huhsumlilhla21, and is conducted as follows:  On the first night the giver of the 
ceremony announces, “We will show our haohtlin22.”   This refers to all the masks 
owned by his family, which have been arranged in rows behind a curtain stretched 
across the rear of the room.  While the people strike with their batons without 
singing, the curtain is raised with three ropes passing over a roof-beam, and every 
mask suddenly rises and moves about in its place.   In a few minutes the curtain is 
lowered, and with brief intervals the spectacle is repeated three more times.  The 
maskers are supposed to be carried away by the spirits which they represent, and 
hence they remain hidden for the next three days.  On the second and third night 
there is no dancing, but a feast is given, and on the fourth night the dancing with 
masks is repeated in order to recover the maskers from the spirits that have 
captured them. (p.171) 
 
The emphasis of the name for the ceremony is its relationship/proximity to the beginning of the 
Winter Ceremony.  The beginning is a privileged position in Kwakwaka’wakw thought, as are 
                                                 
21 galsgamliła 
22 Unsure of this word 

151 
 
 
origins.  A contemporary speaker also gives the translation for this word as “first to show in the 
house” (08/11/12).   The idea of the first is closely associated with the idea of the beginning.  
                          
(239)    Gigalgam     “the first ones” (name of ‘naḿima) 
 
This is the honorific name given to several ‘naḿima amongst different tribes of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw.   The `Tłaťłasikwala, the Gwa’sala, the `Kumuyo’i (Kwexa) and ‘Walas Kwagu’ł 
of the Kwagu’ł confederacy, the Ławiťsis, the Ńamgis, the Aẃa’etłala,  the Kwikwasuťinuxw, the 
Dzawada’enuxw, the Gwawa’enuxw and the Haxwaḿis of the Musgamakw Dzawada’enuxw 
confederacy as well as the Wiweke’ of the Ligwiłda’xw confederacy all have ‘naḿima named 
Gigalgam.  In Boas’ (1966) description of social organization, six of these tribes rank the 
Gigalgam as number one rendering it a significant honorific which breaks from the more 
institutionalized process of naming ‘naḿima after original ancestors.  Again however, the 
emphasis is on “the point of origin.”  “The first ones” refers to the direct connection to the first on 
the land, the first to be served, the first in social rank. 
 

152 
 
 
Another association we could consider here is the word for animals, galga’omas which is 
translated as “animal life” by Grubb (1977, p. 169), and by Boas (1948, p. 250) as “quadrupeds” 
or, a more literal translation could be, “those that crawl”.  This class of beings can be associated 
with original ancestors on the land or perhaps there is a remnant of reference to “those who are 
first.”  I am hesitant to apply this meaning too emphatically as this class of beings excludes both 
the sky beings and sea creatures who also exist as original ancestors.  I merely mention it here 
as a point of interest. 
 
The following diagram attempts to explain the ontological (worldview) paradigm created around 
the gal- stem.  This is more broadly applied use of the word “paradigm” which in linguistics can be 
used quite specifically to refer to “grammatically conditioned forms all derived from a single root or 
stem” (Chrystal, 1999, p. 249).    In this thesis, due to the interdisciplinary crossover of concepts I 
define paradigm as a form which functions much like a family which is connected through various 
resemblances which has crossover with the specific linguistic definition but is more broadly 
applied.  Blevins and Blevins (2009) explain it in the following way: 
 

153 
 
 
         Before turning to the particular role that analogy plays in grammar, it is worth 
highlighting some general aspects of those relational patterns.  First, although the 
analogues in (1) constitute paired objects, strings, and concepts, there is, in 
principle, no limit to how internally complex the analogue or base can be. We 
recognize human families, as well as language families, with mother tongues, 
23daughter languages, and sister dialects.  In language too, families, often called 
paradigms, are a central locus of analogy in grammar.(Blevins & Blevins, 2009, p. 3) 
 
The word family, or paradigm, extended around the stem ga- grants us one example of how 
language form reflects cultural understanding and belief.  The actual repetitive usage of the 
language form in everyday life constantly reinforces the ontology (worldview) that is constructed 
around it.  Figure 4.8 attempts to show the associated meanings that are formed around the stem 
ga- which render its meaning more complex than a simple definition as well as culturally specific.

gay- “to be somewhere”                                                                         gax- “to come” 
 
 
gal- “the beginning,  
      ancestors, origins” 
 
                                                                                                            
                Figure 4.9   Conceptual associations of ga- “closest in proximity to point of origin” 
 
If we compare this conceptual paradigm to English we find it surprising.  English tends to view 
closeness/proximity in time consistently with that which is closest to the present.  Kwak’wala 
tends to reverse this association at times and in broader contexts deposit proximity/closeness 
with the point of origin with the past.  In a sense the past is conflated to meet the present.  This 
concept is enacted over and over within cultural ceremonialism.  For example, one of the first 
rites of the contemporary winter ceremony`tseka,  a component of what is today called “the 
potlatch”, is the imas, where the return of the original ancestor is ritually re-enacted.  This 
ceremony involves a masked dancer entering the ceremonial house from the front, travelling the 
floor and exiting out the back.  The mask is carved according to the origin story of the particular 
          ga- 
  “point of origin, 
   self, or subject” 

155 
 
 
family hosting the ceremony.  The Kwakwaka’wakw ceremonially bring the past into the present.   
Berman notes this conflation and complete split from and Western based temporal 
understanding in her following description: 
 
        “Old” and “recent,” then, do not correspond to a linear model of time.  In Hunt’s 
use of the term “old” (Q-marked) means a superimposition or conflation, between 
present and mythic past, human and spirit, the secular and the winter-dance 
season…The spirit or ancestor, or moment in the past, was the origin; the present 
is descended from that origin. …even the most secular-seeming historical 
narratives take place in a framework of relatedness to the spirit world, to the 
mythic “quality,” and to the deep mythic past. (Berman 2004, p. 140) 
 
Ga- is the seemingly most semantically complex and heavily associated stem of the three spatial 
referential stems ga-, yu- and he-.  Now I will consider yu- which as an intermediate appears to 
have much more limited associations and then either ga- or he-. 
 
 

156 
 
 
4.4 Yu-  referring to someone/something “around”  
Yu- seems relatively straightforward in its associated meaning of distance (around).  While both 
ga- and he- have temporal (time based) associations yu- seems to primarily refer to space 
relations. As with ga- phonological influence of the surrounding consonants can cause the vowel 
“a” in to shift to “u”.  Boas actually spells the stem in his 1948 dictionary as ya-.  While ya- may be 
the base form the, the surface form which emerges most often in speech is yu-, so this form is the 
one used throughout the analysis.  To reiterate, Boas defines yu- as: 
 
 ya-              “demonstrative, something near third person” (Boas 1948:39) 
 
 
While this is the definition given in Boas’ 1948 unpublished dictionary his explanations of the stem 
in his 1947 Kwakiutl Grammar seem to indicate a closer relationship to second person which can 
be referred to as “near you.”   In combination we can take this spatial mapping to encompass “in 
the vicinity of 2nd Person and closely around”.   The stem can be loosely correlated to the English 
“this” (nearby) in opposition to “that” (further away).  In the following example sets the yu- appears 
as a spatial intermediate between ga- “closest in proximity” and he- “somewhat distant.” If we look 
at the morphemes in bold in examples (241) and (242) we see that the demonstrative suffix –

157 
 
 
ux(w) meaning “around”24 is used in correspondence with the phrase initial yu- and is attached to 
the subject.   In (241) the subject is the “treasure” while in (242) the subject is the “mother”.  In 
example (243), with phrase initial he-, the corresponding demonstrative suffix –i’  is attached to 
the subject.  The use of the corresponding suffixes emphasize the spatial delineation between 
speaker and what is spoken about.  In the case of ga- rather than a single morpheme suffix we 
see the application of the phrase ending word gada, which is formed from stem initial ga- plus the 
definitive -da which can be loosely translated as “the”.   The ga- acts as a spatial locator “right 
here by me” while the –da acts as to make the subject more definite in a similar way that “the” is 
more definite than “a” in English. 
 
To compare: 
(240)    Ge’ams ganam gada.     “This is the one who is your wife.” (Boas 1947:258) 
                 This (right here)  your    wife   this/the 
 
(241)    Yu’man długwa’yuxw.     “This (near you) is what is my treasure.” (Boas 1947:258) 
                This (around) my treasure this

Also compare:

             This (around) my mother this 
 
(243)    He’man abampi.     “That’s my mother.” [further away] (U’mista 1981(Vol.2):5) 
                 That (away)  my  mother that 
 
 
The following set shows the three degrees of distance away from the speaker expressed by the 
ga-, yu- and he- stems.  In particular, note the intermediate distance signified by yu-.   These 
sentences are extremely reliant on context for proper grammaticality.  Example (244) can be said, 
if someone phoned the house and the speaker answered and was asked Widi’le Ryan? “Where is 
Ryan?”  If Ryan is in the house the speaker can respond Ga’am laxgan gukwax. “He is here, at 
my house.”   Example (244) can be used when the speaker is just outside the house and is asked 
“Where is Ryan?” and example (245) is used when the speaker is away from the house and is 
asked “Where is Ryan?”  In English, spatial location is ambiguous and the answer to the question 
“Where is Ryan?” can be answered by the single response “He is at my house.” 
 
 
                                                 
25 I have transcribed U’mista’s example as they have spelled it.  Notice the “w” has been dropped.  The 
underlying suffix form is –uxw.

case “house”, are appropriate to those used with determiners (DET) which correspond to spatial 
distance classes in set 2.

To reiterate, the examples (244), (247) and (250) through the use of ga- (+ ga-da) indicates that 
the subject is right here in close proximity, or right next to the speaker.  Examples (245), (248) 
and (251) through the use of yu- (+ -ux[w]) indicates that the subject is nearby, or in the vicinity of 
the one being spoken to.  Examples (246), (249) and (252) show that he- (+ -i) indicates that the 
subject is removed from the speech situation further away than yu-.   These are spatial 
differentiations which are required for proper Kwak’wala.   This spatial definitiveness of yu-  as 
intermediate between ga- and he- is also expressed in the following examples from both a 
historical source (Boas/Hunt) and contemporary sources.   There was no evidence that the use of 
ga-, yu- and he- has deteriorated in contemporary language use.

4.4.1 Unusual older forms containing a temporal element 
The next two sentences are interesting in that they appear to have an extended temporal (time 
 based) reference.  Rather than express intermediate “distance in space” they appear to express 
 intermediate “distance in time”. 
  
(256)    Yud’ekus ‘ałex wałdama.     “This is good your recent word.” (Boas 1947:258)29 
                     this specific? your  recent word 
 
(257)    Yu’am xwanukwaŉakwalas Kwanu’sila.     “These came to be the children of  
                     this        children    next generation30  of  Kwanu’sila            Kwanu’sila”   
       
 
                                                 
28 Contemporary speakers would say this means “We are sleeping there.”  Past tense would be 
Yu’amxda’nuxw mixoxda.   “We slept there.” 
29 The use of “d” in yud’ekus is not recognized by a contemporary speaker.  It appears in many of Boas 
examples in his 1947 “Glossary of the Suffixes.”  It is possible it is an older form no longer in use that marks 
a definitive on the verbal 3rd person.   It does however, show up in contemporary speech  “He’di” for the 
more distant 3rd person “that.” 
30 The suffix  -‘nakwala “gradual, continued motion, one after another” (Boas 1947:241)   al ‘nakwala “next 
generation” (Boas 1948:17) 

162 
 
 
In example (256), “your recent word” is introduced with the phrase initial yu- “nearby/around” 
which rather than correspond to a subject/object in space refers to a speech act which has just 
recently occurred.   In example (257), the ancestor Kwanu’sila , is a being from ancient times. In 
the context of the narrative, the children referred to, are in close temporal relationship, as 
descendants to Kwanu’sila.  This last sentence, in particular provides us with a more complex 
interpretation of the use of the yu- stem though these examples were hard to find and much more 
rare than extended meanings for ga- and he-. 
  
4.5  He-, away from the point of origin, farther away / completely removed 
Boas’ 1948 unpublished dictionary describes he- as having multiple meanings; “that” (3d person 
demonstrative), and “in a straight direction to a distant point.”  In his 1947 “Glossary of the 
Suffixes” he describes it as the “3rd person near the 3rd person”, meaning he/she/it beyond the 
person being spoken to and outside of the speech situation, “He/she/it is over there.”   Reiterating 
Boas, Berman (1991) defines he- as “the verbal form indicating third persons outside the speech 
event as in Hid Sewidi, “He, over there, is Sewid.” (1991:337)  He- has extended meaning which 
while not as pervasive as ga- is more prevalent than yu-.  In order to understand this let’s 

163 
 
 
consider the following examples. Expressing the strictly spatial deictic (context based) meaning 
we have the following:  
 
(258)    He’mas gukwida?     “Is that what is your house?” (Boas 1947:258) 
                  that  your   house  definite 
 
(259)    He’am gukwas Joe.     “That’s Joe’s house.” [over there] (U’mista 1981 Vol.1:21) 
                  that   is    house   his    Joe 
 
(260)    He’am Carolida ťsaťsadagam.     That girl is Carol.” (U’mista 1981 Vol 2:12) 
                  that   is   Carol (away) def. girl 
 
(261)    Hedi’les `Kiksisalas si gukwas `Tayagila’ogwa.  “`Kiksisalas is at `Tayagila’ogwa’s house.” 
                  there  at            (name)      of      house           (name)                       (16/09/11) 
 
(262)    He’mołi gukwas Harry.     “That was Harry’s house.” (16/09/11) 
                  there long ago house of Harry  
 
(263)    Hedi’leda ḱwadzilas.     “He is in the livingroom.” (www.firstvoices.com) 
                  that def. in the    livingroom31 
 
(264)    Hedi leda.     “it’s over there.” (www.firstvoices.com) 
                  there def. in def. 
 
(265)    He’mida.       “it’s over there.” ( 23/10/12) 
                  there it def. 
 
                                                 
31 literally, “place for sitting” 

164 
 
 
It appears that some remnant of the visibility/non-visibility divisions on spatial reference, that Boas 
documented 100 years ago, still exists in contemporary speech.  This seems to have survived in 
the 3rd person he- but is no longer present in the 1st person ga- and 2nd person yu-.   The 
difference in meaning between hedi leda and he’mida is visuality connected to distance.  hedi 
leda is used for topics removed from the speech situation and therefore invisible while he’mida is 
used for topics within the speech situation but peripheral or “further away”, but possibly still 
visible.  All examples encompass the meaning “away from the speech event” whether that 
distance is peripheral to a given location or completely outside of it.  The following diagram seeks 
to illustrate the crossover, the red line representing the division between visability & “around” to 
invisibility and “away”.    In Figure 4.9 the red line represents the boundary where the concepts of 
around and away are divided.  Ga- and yu- indicate that the subject/object is around.  He- can be 
used when the subject/object is still around but peripheral to the speech situation or more 
removed or is used when completely away from the speech situation. The arrows represent the 
ability of he- to be used in both contexts. 

165 
 
 
    
Figure 4.10   He-  “distance away from speech event, proximate or completely outside” 
 
In the following examples, in the first two sentences the father referred to is not around.   The last 
two sentences show that much of the assessment of spatial distance is context driven and not 
strictly applied according to a defined spatial distance but is an interpretation of distance 
according to the topic and context of the speech event.  In example (269) the cup is behind the 
kettle but referred to as “over there”, but possibly in the same room, while in example (270) the 
clam fork is “behind the house” which is obviously outside the vicinity of where the speech is 
taking place.  This indicates that the encompassing parameters of distance are relative rather 
than fixed.

The next examples push the spatial meaning into broader domains that have crossover with time.  
When speaking of events in the past it is appropriate in context to use the corresponding spatial 
distance marker he-.  When speaking of the past it is only appropriate to use the corresponding 
yu- if the events referred to have occurred in close relationship to one another as in the example 
(257).

Linguistic marking of distance in space and in time correspond.  He- indicates distance in space 
and is used correspondingly with the past tense forms –xd (immediate past tense) “having just 
occured, -x’id (intermediate past tense) “having occurred awhile ago”, and -oł [w’oł] (farthest 
degree of past tense) “long ago.”   This can also be translated as meaning removed from the 
speech event by space and/or time.   Berman (1991, Chapter 11) explains this by using the 
metaphor ‘the speech event is a stage’, with participants and actions linguistically marked as 
being “on stage” or “off stage.”  I have found this to be a useful analogy when considering spatial

relationships as relative rather than absolute.  Spatial distance in time and space is relative to the 
topic being discussed with shifting points of focus and therefore “points of origin” which can be 
also described as “focal points” with close associations marked by ga- and yu- and more distant 
associations marked by he-.

With the meaning “to act” or “to be” we have the following set.  We can consider these words and

of “that” as a thing.

This last word is peculiar, and its meaning in relationship to ga- and yu- not entirely clear.  I have 
placed it in here due to the opposition that Boas makes that he-ťsimas refers to “of the kind 
belonging to that privilege”, or we could say “of the rights or cultural prerogatives of an individual” 
vs.  the words ga-ťsimas; yu- ťsimas and ḱi’s- ťsimas which he refers to as meaning “of the kind 
not belonging to.”  If we look at the literal meaning of he- “that” and –ťsimas “something of the 
kind belonging to” it would seem that somehow the idea of distance is related with notions of 
cultural correctness.   The path this association travels is not clear to me but if we consider the 

170 
 
 
next set of words referenced in the secondary meaning of the stem, he- there does appear to be 
a tenuous cultural correlation. 
 
4.5.1.1. The secondary meaning of he- “in a straight direction to a distant point.”   
The secondary definition given by Boas (1948) he- “in a straight direction to a distant point” is 
conceptually related to the primary meaning of “that- further away from the point of discourse/ 
origin or completely removed”, in that it implies distance and the concept ‘away from’.  However in 
this definition the meaning is a more literal and defined address of spatial relationship. The 
addition of varied suffixes to he- render the following words: 
 
(289)    heyaka, or heka      “to pass, to surprise, to exceed” (Boas 1948:98) 
(290)    heyaxsaḱa               “to overdo” (Boas 1948:98) 
(291)    hayud                       “to say right out” (Boas 1948:98) 
(292)    hayusta(la)               “go up river (Boas 1948:98) 
(293)    hebe’                        “to be killed at once (to go straight to end)” (Boas 1948:99) 

171 
 
 
(294)    he’nakwila                “to move straight in that direction” (Boas 1948:99)35 
(295)    Hexalisala                 (name of `Kaniki’lakw ) “to set right in the world” (Boas 1948:99) 
 
This last example is a name for the transformer `Kaniki’lakw who in Kwakwaka’wakw histories 
went about the world challenging the original ancestors and “setting things right.”  Hexalisala, an 
alternative name for `Kaniki’lakw, is a literal expression of his activities.  Referenced in the 
following text, Sutil Point is located on the north end of Vancouver Island. 
 
         Łaxalixalay, the son of Numasanxa’lis who lived at Tsiłtsakala’lis saw `Kaniki’lakw 
coming.  He went into the house and said to his father, “There is a man coming 
towards our house.”  His father replied, “I have been expecting him, our Lord, who 
is setting the world right.  I shall ask him to transform me into a small island on the 
point of Na’widi (Sutil Point) and Xusba’lis (Fort on Point).  The name of the island 
shall be Hanxstalis (Shining on the water), so that I may be seen by the canoes 
passing by.” (Boas 1935:10) 
 
                                                 
35 Contemporary speakers translate this as “to hurry” or “hurry up”.  It is one of the phrases younger people 
tend to know.  Variously pronounced as hanakwila 

172 
 
 
Culturally for the Kwakwaka’wakw the notion of “setting things right” is a significant one.  As 
discussed earlier the imperative to follow the path set forward by ancestors requires travelling a 
straight road and the one prescribed by ancestors is to imitate and carry out the prerogative 
“rights” of the past and to do this as faithfully as possible.  We can consider the following words 
in this context. 
 
(296)    he’stala     “1, go around repeatedly 2, the world” (Grubb 1977:176) 
(297)    he’stalisala     “around the world” (Grubb 1977:176) 
 
In example (286), the act of going around repeatedly is carried out in the ceremonial house on 
the dance-floor as a symbolic act.  The dancers imitate those before them.  In a metaphoric 
sense they are repetitions of generations who have lived before them and who have enacted 
the same ceremonies.  It is a Kwakwaka’wakw cultural imperative that this symbolic process is 
maintained and when these cultural ceremonies were banned by the Canadian government 
from 1885 to1951 the Kwakwaka’wakw fought long and hard against it, in order that this 
generational cycle would not be broken (Cole & Chaikin, 1990).  Metaphorically, the ceremonial 
house is “the world” and in Kwakwaka’wakw histories (what has been referred to as myths) 

173 
 
 
original beings such as `Kaniki’lakw travel the world. It is in this context that the word hayigi’ 
makes sense. 
 
(298)       hayige’     “to imitate [=to go straight back] (Boas 1948:98) 
                                 Yu’mis la hayigisosoxda ałex bagwanama. (R 626:79) 
                                                    this    is        go  imitate (DEF) the            later             man DET 
                                 This is imitated by later (generations of) man. 
 
This means that metaphorically travelling in a “straight direction” is following the road set out by 
ancestors through imitation.  The emphasis is not necessarily linear however, but focussed more 
upon the ideas of “purpose, imitation and extensions forward and backwards.  As examples (286) 
and (287) show, this “straight direction” can be conceptualized as circular.  A straight line is not 
necessarily conceptualized as a straight line from one point to another but consecutive points 
each following the next.   Also consider the following:

(300)    hiłťsa         “to catch up to” (Grubb 1977:176)

(303)    ha’yu’sala   “to go right from one to another” (Boas 1848:98) 
 
Additional cultural clues are contained within Kwakwaka’wakw personal names.  The name  
Ha’yusdisalas  means “to go straight up from the beach ” and the name Ha’etłalas means “to go 
straight through the door”37.  This means that when you arrive at the beach you go straight to this 
person’s house. The reference is to giving feasts and potlatches.  Traditional travel by canoe 
meant arrival by guests, to coastal villages, by beachfront.  
 
4.5.1.2.  Temporal (time) crossover of the meaning of he- 
The notion of moving in “a straight direction to a distant point” has a spatial dimension which 
maps to the verbal he- “away, over there, off-stage of the speech event”.  It may also have a 
temporal application in Figure 4.10, where the yu- and he- stems seem to find expression in a 
spatial/time based crossover.   The central green circle represents the concept “today” or “now”.

The next encompassing circle represents the temporal passage of time the length of a day. 
“tomorrow” or “yesterday”.  The final outer circle represents the passage of another day “day after 
tomorrow” and “day before yesterday”.  These are commonly used terms for situation events in 
time in somewhat close relationship to the present.  Outside of two days distance from the 
present (today) speaking about time based events switches to a different set of temporal locators.

If we compare the outer rings of the framing for “a day” as marked by he- we could infer that the 
stem means outside of, or removed from” by more than a day.  In the same way we could 
consider the outer ring of the generational Figure 4.11 below and translate the he- to mean 
“outside of, or removed from” by more than two generations.

4.6 Implied distance of objects and events in time and space  gax-,  la-,  and  he-. 
He- has a spatial relationship to la- and gax-.  Earlier we discussed the difference in proximate 
relationships in motion between gax- and la-; gax- meaning “movement towards close proximity”, 
while la- encompasses the meanings “movement away from close proximity” and “ongoing 
sequential relationship onwards”.  In everyday speech and narrative the la- auxiliary is used most 
often as the following example from Boas, (1902):

Gwa’i.  Kawadilikala was their chief.   Tawixi’lakw was the eldest son of Kawadilikala.  
Tawixi’lakw killed mountain goats with great ease.  Now, the mountain goat hunter 
had been resting for a long time, and the first of the Dzawada’enuxw were very 
hungry.  Then Kawadilikala asked his son to go to hunt mountain goats, that he might 
feed his tribe.  Tawixi’lakw got ready to go on the following day.” (p. 7) 
 
The sentence initial la’la’e is a convention used in the narration of ancient type stories such as 
the one exemplified above.   It can be translated as “and then...”.  The primary expression is the 
movement (going) along a continuum.  It makes sense that this would be more productive and 
appear more often in speech than gax- as the opposite movement “towards” once arrived can 
no longer be continuous.  In this 1902 transcript almost every sentence is introduced by la’la’e, 
indicating the relationship of events as sequential.  Only in the final sentence is this pattern

broken and by an introductory phrase using he- (he- x’id-a) translated as “at once”.  The 
difference between “and then” marked by la- and “at once” marked by he- is subtle but 
significant.  Berman (1991) explains that while the la- infers sequentiality the he- infers an 
activity performed concurrently; not in sequence but simultaneously.  The difference is a spatial 
one; concurrence in time, distance in space.   In the following illustration the arrows represent 
the use of la-, gax- and he-  as verbal auxiliaries expressing the sequence of events in narrative.

Berman (1991, pp. 322-336) gives a valuable analysis regarding the use of these verbal stems as 
discourse markers in narrative which is detailed and more comprehensive.   The reason I touch 
on it here is that, once again, with the use of he- there is an implication of spatial distance that is 
consistent with a broader application in extended use and meaning than can be literally or 
narrowly defined 
 
4.7 Summary   
In order to consider the concept of space, and sometimes its conceptual analogy in time, I began 
this chapter by looking at personal space in relationship to the body, or self.  This I identified as 
the subject or “point of origin” of the speech act.   I first considered personal pronouns, which 
identify relationships between “speaker”, “person spoken to”, and “subject/object”.  In Kwak’wala, 
we find that this system still retains much definition which is ambiguous in English.  In particular 
we find that the 3rd person subject/object “he/she/it” is divided into two spatial arenas which can 
be interpreted as “away from the speech event but still visible” and “completely away from the 
speech event rendering it non-visible.”  From there I considered the verbal auxiliary stems ga-, 
yu-, and he-.   These stems in particular delineate spatial relationships between the location of the 
speaker and subject/objects (persons/things spoken about); ga- meaning “in close proximity”, yu- 

181 
 
 
meaning “around” and he- meaning “further away, or removed altogether = distant”.  Each of 
these stems while having a literal formal application in everyday language have extended 
meaning beyond the literal.  Of the three, ga- appears to have the most culturally applied 
extensions of meaning.  These meanings are anchored to ideas around “points of origins” and 
“beginnings” which are not restricted to a single speech event but can be translated into social 
historical contexts of cultural “origins” which are highly potent concept in Kwakwaka’wakw 
ontology.  Yu- is the most limited of the three, which is to be expected with an intermediate 
application.  He- has extended meaning beyond the literal which encompasses the notion of 
“distance” in various contexts but is not as culturally pervasive as ga-.   Knowledge and 
understanding of these spatial markers in regards to space relationships is an essential 
component of proper Kwak’wala speech but in order to have a full comprehension of their 
meaning it is important that they are understood not just in their formal application but also in their 
extensions into broader contexts.  These divisions of space and their extended meanings come 
easily to native speakers whose minds have categorized the divisions and their associations 
since birth.  The next chapter will consider spatial terminology in relationship to the “house” and 
the extended conceptual associations manifest in culture.

          The Body=House=Land Metaphor in Kwakwaka’wakw Culture 
 
 
         …did you not see the soul last night which came and sat on my hand? It is the size of 
our thumb, when it shrinks and becomes small; then I put the soul on top of our head, 
and it grows so that it is the same size as our body [‘ukwani’], for the body is the house 
of the soul…(Boas 1921:724)    
     
5.1  Kwakwaka’wakw houses in relationship to the body and the universe 
The Kwakwaka’wakw traditional house as an extension of the body is a major metaphor for 
Kwakwaka’wakw cultural understanding. Up into the early Twentieth Century the 
Kwakwaka’wakw lived in large homes 39gukwala constructed of cedar.   These architectural 
structures were expansive, measuring at times 40-60 feet in length and width.   The roof could 
rise to approximately 20-30 feet in height.   Several families of a ‘naḿima  “extended family 
group” could occupy one house.   During daily life the interiors were sectioned off into rooms but 
                                                 
39 In modern times these houses are called gukwdzi which translates as bighouse.   However, this appears 
to be a relatively new word as house terms from the turn of the last century refer to the house as just 
gukw or gukwa (Boas 1948:260) but do not list gukwdzi.   In iteration of this Charlie Dawson, an elder of 
the Dzawada’enuxw, born in 1919, relayed the information that the proper term for a house was gukwam 
and that the term gukwdzi was simply a descriptive referring to a large house (gukw- a stem referring to a 
house and the suffix –dzi a descriptive of large size. 

183 
 
 
during the ceremonial season the house would be cleared and transformed into a space of 
elaborately performed rituals.  The house was considered a living entity, an extension of its 
inhabitants.   Houses were adorned with hereditary crests and those acquired through marriage 
or warfare. (Easton & Nobokov, 1989)  The concept of the house and the lineage it represented 
was of more importance than the physical house itself as the concept could be replicated in the 
form of a marriage gift.  The gifting of a house, with its name and histories from the father-in-law 
to the son-in-law was an extremely prestigious act.  
  
In Figure 5.1 the relationship of the house to the landscape is laid out.   On a cosmic level then, 
it is possible to conceptualize the traditional Kwakwaka’wakw community house in multiple 
ways.   In one way, the house is considered as a microcosm of the world.   The roof represents 
the sky, or the heavens; the floor represents the earth.   Under the floor is considered to be the 
underground, the place of the ghosts.   During the ‘tseka winter season this conceptualization is 
amplified and granted expression through elaborate ritual.    During Kwakwaka’wakw winter 
ceremonies all three levels are utilized in complex and varied performances.

tunnels dug out for the purposes of such performances.   It is from the roof that the hamaťsa 
appears, dramatically dropping down through the smoke-hole, or through a hole in the roof 
created by the removal of boards.   In one ceremony he descends down a post that is

considered to be an aspect of the heavens though this was a prerogative that belonged only to 
certain families.   By analogy, the house, during ritualistic periods encompassed the universe.

The traditional Kwakwaka’wakw house is composed of a skeletal framework of cedar posts (see 
Figure 5.2) covered by a shell of cedar boards.   The posts were permanently installed and 
remained in place while family groups traveling to various locations to harvest food stores, could 
remove the outer layer of boards and take them for use on more temporary shelters.   The 
skeletal post-work is structurally and conceptually similar to the body.   Like a body, the skeletal 
interior structures are more permanent than the outer covering.   Identity is embedded in the 
skeletal structure of the house.   The outer covering could be removed and the house would still 
maintain its integrity.    Graphic representations could be carved onto the ‘ḱiḱw  “primary vertical 
posts” of the house and the ḱatiwe’  “primary crossbeams” that support the roof.   The 
secondary vertical posts that are not carved (not animated) are called dlam “small house post”.   
The stem dla- translates as “to stand”.  It is applied to inanimate beings, while the stem dlaxw  
“to stand” is used for animate beings (Boas, 1948).   The carved primary posts and primary 
crossbeams are granted animation through their graphic representation as mythological beings.  
In Figure 5.3 a  house post carved in the form of a human figure stands in the foreground and in 
the background is the skeleton post and beams of Johnny Scow’s house depicted in chapter 3 
(Figure 3.1).

In a Boas (1888) narrative involving a marriage between the ancestors of the Dzawada’enuxw 
and the Kwagu’ł the representation of a house as a living entity is emphasized.   When 
Kawadilikala brings his future son-in-law, ‘Umaxtalatle’ to his house, he warns him to be careful 
in entering as the doorway is a giant beak that may kill uninformed visitors.   Kawadilikala gifts 
the house to his son-in-law.   When it is rebuilt at the village site of ‘Umaxtalatle’ the house is 
described in the following way: 

188 
 
 
     The two uprights in the front part of the house represent two men: Yakent’eka 
(something talking inside) and Waweqamitl (the orator).   The uprights in the rear of 
the house also represent men: Leqe’laqsta (the braggart) and Hasakawa’sui 
(attempting to talk louder than anybody else).   The uprights in front of the house 
support the beams that represent the Sisiutl (a double-headed snake), while those in 
the rear of the house are connected by a cross-piece representing a Sisiutl (or wolf?), 
upon which the beams rest.   The hinges of the house door are at its upper edge.   It 
is very heavy and crushes every bad man who attempts to enter the house.   His 
dancing mask was called Olikyen, and represented a wolf; the dance in which it is 
used is called Walasaqak (something great coming from above).   When the house 
was finished Om’aqta’latle gave a great feast, and the beams and uprights of his 
house began to move.   The sisiutl played with their tongues.   The men began to talk   
           and told the sisiutl to kill all enemies of their master (pp. 203-204).41   
 
  
 In this narrative, even the primary house-posts are given names.   The house is given as  
                                                 
41 I have maintained the original spelling of the Kwak’wala names as is presented by Boas in his paper 
“Houses of the Kwakiutl Indians” 1888 except where the phonemes were presented as backwards.   This 
occurs with the phoneme (k) where it appears both backwards and up-side down.  Where backwards and 
up-side down (k)appear I have substituted k. This was a very early publication in the corpus of Boas’ 
research and his facility with the language as well as consistent application of phonological forms was 
less developed then in later publications.

an inheritance to the son-in-law in recognition of the children the marriage will produce and 
the promise of maintaining the lineage of the father-in-law through them.   In this sense the 
“house” is re-built both literally and metaphorically.  Figure 5.4 depicts the interior 
houseposts of a contemporary version of the Kawadilikala house which still stands in Gwa’yi 
(Kingcome Inlet).

While the structural value of a house appears to be invested primarily in its internal structure  
over the external, the conceptualized social value of a house lies in the accumulated history of 
the family whom the house represents.   Like a living being the house carries the lineage of its 
occupants and this is represented by the carvings of the house-beams along with the 
iconography of the house-front.  
 
As well as symbolizing the heritage of the occupants the house is granted an independent 
bounded identity in the application of a name.  The practice of naming houses has been 
maintained into contemporary times, though not without transition.43  The interior component 
parts of a house are given names as well but in a generic sense rather than having proper 
names.  Some of the house component names carry more culturally applied information than 
others.   The following interesting descriptive is given by Boas (1909) in “The Kwakiutl of 
Vancouver Island”: 
 
                                                 
43 A century ago Kwakwaka’wakw houses were occupied by a single family group (na’mima) and the name 
given the house was the prerogative of that specific group.   Modern gi’gukwdzi  (bighouses) are built to 
represent entire communities composed of several family groups.   In the case of the gukwdzi built in 
‘Yalis (Alert Bay) in the nineteen-sixties and re-built in 1999 its original intent was to represent all of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw nations.   As far as I know, it does not carry a name.   However, a smaller house built in 
Gwa-yi (Kingcome Village) in 2003 was given the name Hi’manis.    

191 
 
 
     The parts of the house are oriented right and left according to the positions they 
have in relation to a person looking in at the door.   The rear of the house is called 
its “forehead.”   Thus we have the terms ŉake’wa’lil (middle forehead of house) for 
the middle of the rear part (a); hil`kutiwa’lil and gamxutiwa’lil respectively for the 
right (b) and left (c) of the rear part; hil`kudani’gwil and gamxudani’gwil for right (d) 
and left (e) rear corners.   The rear part of the sides (f) is called “up river;” the front 
part (g) of the sides “down river;” and we have ‘nal`kudo’ya’lil and gwa`kudo’ya’lil, 
“up-river and down-river middle of house,” and more specifically these terms 
combine with hil`kudo’ya’lil and gamxuto’ya’lil  (“right and left sides”).   Right and left 
sides of the door (h, i) are hil`kutsa’lil and gamxutsa’lil respectively (pp. 415-416)

rear and front portions of the sides (this will be re-visited in chapter 6).   These two terms 
bring into focus the concept of the house as a metaphor of the landscape.   The application 
is conceptual rather than literal as literally houses would face the river and their sides would 
correspond to up-river and down-river not their front and back.   The terms focus the interior 
of the house as a space that exists independent of its position in the landscape.   It is a 
spatial interior that is conceptualized on its own terms, except that however malleable the 
conceptualization of the space might be, its structural similarity to a body remains

        While the modelling of the house as a microcosm of the universe is manifest in its architecture, 
the traditional living arrangements of families within traditional Kwakwaka’wakw houses 
reflected deeply embedded analogical conceptualizations of societal and environmental 
structure.   The application of the terms “upriver” and “downriver” to the corresponding “back” 
and “front” of the interior of the traditional house reflected the social rank and hierarchy of the 
community with the chief and those of higher aristocratic standing occupying the back “upriver” 
sections of the house and the lower ranked house members occupying the front or “downriver”

sections of the house.  Figure 5.6 shows the interior “upriver” view of John Scow’s bighouse at 
Gwayasdams (Gilford Island) village.   Traditionally the chief of the house occupied the back 
portion of the house through an entrance which was situated between the two back house 
posts.   Ernest Scow, nephew of John Scow remembers that his uncle maintained this section 
of the house as his living quarters (personal communication).

         The symbolism of the “upriver and “downriver” sections of the house interior are situated within 
the concept of the house as a microcosm of the land.  Once the body is outside of the house the 
orientation is no longer symbolic but literal, the upriver component of the community taking its 
appropriate placement within the literal physical environment of land and water (sea and river).

The house symbolically becomes a microcosm of the universe and the universe can also be 
considered as an expanded house.  Synthesized to this relationship is the conceptualization of 
the body as a microcosm of the house and of the land.  The house is analogous to both the 
body and the land; the body is analogous to the house and the land, and the land is analogous 
to the house and the body.  The Kwakwaka’wakw rendering of this analogy as explicit pushes it 
into a major metaphorical concept; the body is a house, and the house is a body; the house is 
the land and the land is a house.   The body, the house and the land (world) are all reflections of 
one another.  The spatial relationships of objects within these defined spaces are relative only 
to the expansion and contraction of the stage or platform defined by context (body, house or 
land) but they maintain their structural relationships.  
         
                   
         5.2  -ił “inside the house”,  -is “outside on the land” 
         The experience of “the house” as intermediary between the body and the land has linguistically 
marked significance.  Just as the world is divided into regions of the land and sea the house 
divides space into inside and outside, interior and exterior.   These are given expression in the 
often applied suffixes –ił “ in house” and –is “on beach or land”.   The following examples are 
taken from Boas (1947) “Glossary of the Suffixes” p.239

         -s’ and -is are allomorphs of each other, as are -ił and -eł.  We can consider the base forms to

extensively in Kwak’wala speech and are often compulsory.  It is a significant division in the 
Kwakwaka’wakw mindset.  If we consider English by comparison we see that the concepts “in 
the house” (inside) and “on the land” (outside) are not required delineations in everyday speech.

The division between the inside and the outside is a significant division in Kwakwaka’wakw 
spatial conceptualization that is marked in the Kwak’wala language by the locatives generally 
meaning “in the house” and “in the world”.   While the definition of the suffix –ił appears to be 
defined in relationship to interior spaces within the “house” the suffix –is can be defined more 
broadly and poetically.  –is  can encompass meanings such as “on the beach”, “in the world”, 
“on the bottom of the water”, “on the bottom of the body”.

-is indicates the region of the land outside the house.  –ił indicates the region of the interior.  -ił 
can also act as a locative meaning “on the floor of the house.”  These regions can have 
symbolic significance as well.   Kwakwaka’wakw ritualized gestures made on the secular level 
can be linked to the sacred through analogy.   The act of name giving by the father-in-law 
through marriage to his son-in-law ritually mimics the original acts of naming performed by 
animal ancestors to humanity (Boas 1935).  These marriage rites of naming the son-in-law are 
performed in the “house” in the same way that original naming occurred “in the land”.  The 

201 
 
 
difference is the setting or stage upon which analogous actions occur.  The analogy also has a 
temporal quality since the original act in the sacred past is mimicked in the secular present: 
 
         The first names are those of beings that live in the sky and come down in the form 
of birds, quadrupeds or sea animals, that become men.  As soon as they become 
real human beings they assume new names…  Names are often bestowed as part 
of the gifts that a person receives from supernatural beings.  These gifts are quite 
analogous to those given by a man to his son-in-law.   In C18144 the hero actually 
marries the daughter of the supernatural beings.  The assumption is that the 
names the father-in-law gives away have first been obtained through an encounter 
with a supernatural being. (Boas 1935, p. 52) 
 
The intermediary of the house between the body and the land is also given form through 
mythological description.   One version of the origins of the ‘Wi’womasgam of the 
Kwikwasuťinuxw describes how their original ancestor, a kolus, younger brother of the 
thunderbird, descends to earth through the door of the upper world: 
 
                                                 
44 C181 refers to Boas’ own system for cataloguing his publications. 

202 
 
 
         The Thunder-bird was living in the upper world with his wife; and the name of the 
Thunder-bird was Too-Large.  Now Too-Large was very downcast.  He spoke to his 
wife, and said, “Oh mistress, let us go to the lower world, that I may see it.” Thus he 
said. Then his wife said, “Oh master, do you know about your name, that you have 
the name Too-Large, for you will be too large a chief in our lower world?”  Thus said 
his wife to him. The Too-Large only said, “Just let us get ready to go.”  Thus he said; 
and then he put on his Thunder-bird mask, and his wife also put on her Thunder-bird 
mask.  They came flying through the door of the upperworld. (Boas 1902, p.165) 
 
       
          The Kwak’wala words for the last sentence are: 
  
                          Wa, gax’la’e ṕałtsa lax ťaxalasa iḱadziἸisasants ŉalax. 
                                     Then,  came       flying     through  door  the       upper   they        world 
 
 
The universe is described as a giant house and the division between the land and the sky is 
accessed through “a doorway”.   In addition to this description we have the following ancestor 
story of the `Tłaťłalamin of the Ńamgis which also describes the original descent of a kolus: 
 
Kolus was a bird when he came down.  He looked for a house.  Then the bird 
disappeared, and he began to be a man.  He became possessed of a house, the 

203 
 
 
outside of which was cloudless; and stars were on the house that he brought down 
with him.  Then he married.  He had children, and they became many, and they 
became the `Tłaťłalamin clan. (Boas 1910, p. 81) 
 
 
In this version the description of the house is analogous to the land in a more literal sense; the 
roof of the house is a cloudless sky.  Stars adorn the house as they do the night sky.   
 
Figure 5.9 shows the kolus over grizzly bears back house posts from Johnny Scow’s house 
(see Figures 3.1 and 5.6).  The right to use this carving was directly connected to the origin 
narratives of the Kwikwasuťinuxw.   While literally the kolus forms the structure of the wooden 
house of Johnny Scow it is also the kolus who form the foundation of origin and lineage which 
holds up the “house” of Johnny Scow metaphorically.  All material culture manifestations 
amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw had to be connected to an origin or source either through lineage 
or marriage and that story needed to be validated publicly.  The “house” became the ultimate 
expression of identity and as such was loaded with symbolism and rich metaphorical extensions 
into social structure.

5.3 The house metaphor and social structure: the ‘naḿima  is a house 
 
The metaphor of “the body is a house” has particular significance in Kwakwaka’wakw social 
structure in both literal and symbolic ways.  The individual is conceived as a component of a 
social whole.  The extended family is represented through traditional house architecture and 
occupation.  Large houses were occupied by both independent and extended families with 
independent family groups occupying partitioned and separated spatial sections of the house.   
The primary social unit of the Kwakwaka’wakw  is not the tribe but the ŉaḿima  house groups 

205 
 
 
which form the tribes.  These groups have been variably referred to in English as the “clans” 
and sometimes “houses” of the tribe.  In Boas’ texts there are a few words that defy English 
translation to the point that he chooses not to interpret them but to retain them in their 
Kwak’wala form.  The word ŉaḿima is one of them. 
 
         The inhabitants of each village are further subdivided into groups called ŉaḿima, 
meaning “one kind.”  The individuals in each ŉaḿima are called “ ŉaḿima fellows” 
(ŉaḿimut).  These divisions are the ultimate units bound together by strict social 
obligations. (Boas1966, p.37) 
 
Judith Berman in her 1991 dissertation “The Seal’s Sleeping Cave” gives a valuable and 
revealing morphological analysis of the word and the concept of ŉaḿima. 
 
         The name for the Kwagul descent group suggests that it was conceived of as in some 
way an egalitarian organization.  Ńaḿimut derives from a stem ŉaḿima, which in turn 
derives from a root, ŉaḿ- or ŉaḿa-.  The root expresses notions similar both to English 
“one” as a measure of quantity, and “oneness” as a quality of relationship.  It appears 

206 
 
 
in many terms for social relationships, in which both these meanings are combined: 
ŉaḿimut “descent group members”, ŉaḿwut, ŉaḿwiyut “brother, cousin of same sex, 
friend”, ŉaḿukw “friend, person”, ŉaḿa’ił, ŉaḿa’iłẃut “house-mate, “ ŉamgustolut “age 
mate,” ŉamxtłała, ŉamxtła’ini’ “[nuclear?] family,” and so on (Boas n.d.:239-40). In the 
word ŉaḿimut, the root ŉam- is suffixed with –[`]ima “class of thing, kind of thing. “ 
Ńaḿima literally means “one kind of thing.”  By itself ŉaḿima can be used to refer to 
“brothers” or “cousins” (e.g. Boas 1897; 682; 1921; 824), as well as to the descent 
group as a whole.  The ŉaḿimut, then, is a “group of fellows of the same kind.”  The 
name at least connotes equality, sameness, commonality, unity and fellowship, in the 
same way perhaps, that “brother” does in English.  In English, Hunt always referred to 
the ŉaḿimut as a “brother tribe,” that is, a social group composed of brothers (Hunt to 
Boas, 11/12/16 et seq.) [Berman 1991, p. 70] 
 
 
The ŉaḿima can be translated as “the house”.  The house is used as a metaphor for the 
ŉaḿima.  In the same way a literal Kwakwaka’wakw house is filled with linked families so the 
ŉaḿima is filled with the social standing of “family” members.  Both the domestic household and 
the social “house” (clan) are composed by human occupants in ranked order.  This order was 

207 
 
 
represented in the placement of living quarters within the domestic house but became amplified 
in the arrangement of seats in the ceremonial house where rank is accorded specific seating 
arrangements based on the notion that the most highly considered guests were seated in the 
“upriver” sides of the house.  The specificity of seating arrangement is no longer adhered to 
today. 
 
The ŉaḿima is the fundamental unit of the tribe.  When conducting a survey of Kwakwaka’wakw 
social organization Boas (1897) lists four tribes under the Koskimo (Guskimukw) subdialect, two 
under the Newettee (Nawidi) subdialect, and twenty under the Kwakiutl (Kwagu’ł) subdialect.  It 
is interesting to note that he defines only the Kwakiutl subdialect tribes as referring to 
themselves as Kwakwaka’wakw45.  Each tribe is composed of two to several ŉaḿima.   I 
consider the ŉaḿima to be the fundamental unit rather than the tribes as prior to contact the 
majority of ceremonial inter-relations occurred amongst smaller less extended groups and only 
since the early 1800’s onwards do we see the rise of the inter-tribal ceremonialism of today.  
This means that prior to contact traditional inter-relations occurred mainly at the ŉaḿima to 
ŉaḿima level.  This has shifted to the tribal level only in the last one hundred and fifty years 
                                                 
45 The contemporary application of the name Kwakwaka’wakw to all the tribes is a fairly recent adjustment in 
self-identification. (1980’s-today) 

208 
 
 
which required the fairly modern development of a tribal ranking system.  This is clearly mapped 
out in the unpublished notes of the anthropologist Wilson Duff when he recorded Mungo Martin 
in the 1950-60s.  When we consider the occupation of the coast by the Kwakwaka’wakw to 
extend at least over thousands of years we can comparatively identify the ŉaḿima as the 
fundamental social unit.  To show by example how the ŉaḿima are composed under a tribal 
group I have excerpted the following for the Dzawada’enuxw; whom Boas lists as Tsawatainox 
(Boas 1897:331)  In his notes published after his death Boas(1966:40-41) had added the 6th 
ŉaḿima  Gigalgam. 
 
                  10. Tsawatainox (=people of the oulachon country). Kingcombe Inlet 
                  Clans: 1.  Lilawagila (=the heaven makers – mythical name of raven). 
                             2.  Gigagama’i (=chiefs) 
                             3.  Wi’ukwama’i (=whom no one dares to look at) 
                             4.  ‘Ka’kakila’ka  (=always wanting to kill people) 
                             5.  Kikudilikala (=the Kawadilikalas) 
                             6.  Gigalgam (=the first ones)46 
 
 
According to the Kwakwaka’wakw themselves who started to keep written ledger records of 
potlatch give-aways as early as the 1880’s once members had acquired some literacy the 
ŉaḿima groups were kept track of under their corresponding tribal units confirming much of 
                                                 
46 Ledger accounts list a seventh ŉaḿima as the Yiyagadalal (personal communication R. Nicolson).    

209 
 
 
Boas documentation with some changes.  As late as the 1960’s the names of the 
Dzawada’enuxw ŉaḿima groups, their rank in correspondence to each other and the individual 
standings of the ŉaḿima members were written down in ledger books.   
 
A comparison of household compositions documented by the Canadian Census from 1881, 
1891, 1901 and 1911, when the Kwakwaka’wakw still occupied traditional houses exhibit 
evidence that ŉaḿima groups, for the most part, corresponded to household memberships.  
The ŉaḿima family group is both symbolic of and literally identified with the concept of the 
“house”.  The analogy of the body with the house by extension is given example by Boas in the 
following way; 
 
         The structure of the numayma (ŉaḿima) is best understood if we disregard the living 
individuals and rather consider the numayma as consisting of a certain number of 
positions to each of which belongs a name, a “seat” or “standing place,” that means 
rank and privileges.  Their number is limited, and they form a ranked nobility.  I am 
told that among the thirteen tribes of the region extending from Fort Rupert to 
Nimpkish River and Knight Inlet, there are 658 seats (Boas 1925a, 83) These 

210 
 
 
names and seats are the skeleton of the numayma, and individuals in the course of 
their lives, may occupy various positions and with them take the names belonging to 
them (Boas 1966:50) 
 
 
The seats of a ŉaḿima form a household, or literally a “house”. According to Boas, “The 
numayma consist of families embracing essentially household groups and the nearest relatives 
of those who married into the household groups” (p. 48).  The house is composed of a 
membership, who are ranked by what Boas terms a “seat” or “standing place”.  Literally, once 
inside the ceremonial house these seats are arranged in rank order.  The membership of the 
ŉaḿima  form its body while the leadership (gigame’) or chiefs form the head.  This standing 
was symbolized in spatial allocation both within the domestic household and the ceremonial.   
 
         The highest-ranking chief of the ŉaḿimut is the head chief, called by a number of 
terms, among them dłaxwamala “standing at the head” and xamagame’ “(the one) 
alone at the front.”  Lower ranking chiefs were called by such terms as gigał “second 
chief,” or gigabo’i “chief at the end” (Berman 1991, p. 71) 
 

211 
 
 
The ŉaḿima is conceptualized both as a house and as a body.  In the Kwakwaka’wakw 
mindset the equation of the two concepts are closely aligned.   A house is an architectural 
version of the animate body made up by its occupants.  The ŉaḿima groups lived on the 
land in distinct locations sometimes associated with encounters with ancestors.   
 
         According to Indian theory, the ancestor of a ŉaḿima (sometimes also of a tribe) 
appeared at a specific locality by coming down from the sky, out of the sea, or 
from underground, generally in the form of an animal, took off his animal mask, 
and became a person (Boas 1935c, 41).  The Thunderbird or his brother (Kolus), 
the gull, the Killer Whale, a sea monster, a grizzly bear, and a ghost chief appear 
in this role. (Boas 1966, p.42) 
 
 
A general rule of land occupation followed that these locations were most often occupied 
during summer months during what was considered the baxus, or season of the profane.   
‘Naḿima  groups then joined one another for the sacred winter season rearranging the village 
collective into a tribe.  Sometimes several tribes would gather together rendering even greater 
distinction in arrangement of houses in relationship to one another.  It might serve our purpose 

212 
 
 
to consider at this point the linguistic analysis of the words for house and village.  The word for 
house in Kwak’wala is gukw.  The word for ‘one’s own tribe’ is gukwalu’t.  Obviously the stem 
for ‘one’s own tribe’ is the word for house.  “The villagers are called the “fellow inhabitants of 
the houses” gukwalu’t (Boas 1966:37).  The formal compositional expansion of the words 
gukw and gukwalu’t mimic the actual spatial expansion of “the house” to the tribe “several 
houses”. 
  
The concept of expansion and contraction (microcosm/macrocosm) is reversed within the 
transition of the domestic house to the ceremonial house.   The large multi-family dwellings of 
the Kwakwaka’wakw were cleared of their partitions and emptied for the transition into a 
ceremonial house.  The ceremonial house was divided into a main central space with a central 
fire and a back room reserved for initiates and preparations.  Seating was arranged along the 
walls, front entrance area and back.  During ceremonies seats were deliberately arranged in 
order of the rank or position of each ŉaḿima member.  Depending on the type of ceremony 
being enacted the house seating took on different forms.  The attendance of more than one 
ŉaḿima required certain adjustments as the ŉaḿima would be placed in order of rank next to 
one another as well as recognizing internal standing.  As mentioned before, prior to contact 

213 
 
 
ceremonial gatherings were more self-contained affairs with single ŉaḿima or multiple 
ŉaḿima gatherings taking place.  The occasion of multi-tribal gatherings occurred less often.  
After contact, the Kwakwaka’wakw tribes began to conduct their ceremonies more extensively 
with each other forcing them to come up with additional ranking systems and seating 
arrangements.   In other words, the seating delegations of the ceremonial house expand to 
encompass and include additional ŉaḿima and tribal groups.  A single house under 
ceremonial conditions expands from the occupation of a single ŉaḿima (house, clan) to the 
occupation of several ŉaḿima and even tribes.  In contemporary times this expansion now 
includes all the Kwakwaka’wakw tribes and acknowledgement of the individual ŉaḿima groups 
of the tribes has been largely forgotten.  It has become part of our contemporary exercise to 
return the understanding of the ŉaḿima ‘houses’ to contemporary ceremonialism.   In a 
figurative sense then when the ŉaḿima groups gather together within the ceremonial house it 
becomes a case of houses contained and arranged within a house analogous to how the 
ŉaḿima houses were at one time contained within the landscape – ‘houses within a house’ 
under ceremonial conditions mimics “houses within the land (the world as a house)” under 
geographic conditions.  That this same ‘house as landscape’ can also be related to as ‘house 
as body’ is reflected on by Judith Berman in the following: 

214 
 
 
         Three interrelated metaphors, which were used with particular frequency to talk 
about the ŉaḿimut, embody the notions of “rank” and “substance.”  These are the 
metaphor of the house, the metaphor of the body, and the metaphor of precedence. 
         3.3.3. Chiefs and the metaphor of the house.  The myth that describes the founding 
of the ŉaḿimut, and the origin of ŉaḿimut seats and prerogatives, is often called 
nuyamił, literally “myth in house” or “History of the house.” In this trope, the bighouse 
is used as a metaphor for the ŉaḿimut as a whole. (Berman 1991:94) 
 
 
Her linguistic analytical observations of the House / Body metaphor are as follows: 
 
 
         Lexically, the usage of a number of words and morphemes connects houses with 
the bodies of animate beings.  The somatic suffix =axsta “mouth, at or on mouth, to 
do something with mouth,” is often used with the suffix =ił “in or of the house” to 
refer to the door into a house or a room.  A door is thus literally a “house-mouth” 
(=axstaἸił).  Thus we have forms such as ḱwaxstaἸił “to sit at door of room” (ḱwa- “to 
sit,” =axsta “mouth,” =ił “in the house, of the house”).  A related suffix =itł, means, 
variously, “to go into house, to go into mouth, to go into inlet.” 

215 
 
 
         Not only is the house door like a mouth, the whole house-front is like a face or head.  
The suffixes –gam “face, head” and –[g]iu “forehead, to have on forehead,” are used 
in this regard.  Thus, the planks forming the front façade are called, individually or 
collectively, tsagami’ “standing on edge at the face” or “face that is a vertical plane” 
(tsag- “vertical plane,” –[g]am “face, head,” –i’ “nominalizing suffix”; Boas 1921:805-
6).   Similarly, a beam supporting carvings on the upper edge of a house-front is 
katiwi’ “long object [put on] forehead” (kat- “to put long object somewhere,” –[g]iu 
“forehead, to have on forehead,” –i’ “nominalizing suffix”; Boas 1921:810).  Inside 
the house the “front” is reversed.  The rear of the house, where the chief’s living 
quarters are located and where the chief and the highest-ranking nobles sit during 
public events, is called ‘ugwiwaἸił, literally, “forehead inside the house” (‘u- “empty 
root47,” –[g]iu “forehead,” –ił “in the house”; Boas 1921:944. (Berman 1991, p. 77) 
 
 
The house is decorated in accordance with the ŉaḿima history.  Its’ architecture of post and 
lintel beams are often, though not always, carved with the images of ancestral encounters and 
                                                 
47 In accordance with Chapter 3, I consider this form to be a categorizer rather than an empty root. 
 

216 
 
 
acquired crests through marriage rendering in a figurative way the skeleton or backbone of the 
ŉaḿima history.  In comparing the ŉaḿima house to the body Berman also states: 
         The chief was the ŉaḿimut’s head; the commoners were ‘ugwidi’ the “body,” or 
bagwiłidi’, “chief’s men of the body,” both terms using the suffix –git “body as a 
whole, all over surface of body.”  The chief’s official speaker was called, variously, 
the “mouth” (sams), “tongue” (ḱalam), the “blood” (‘alkw), and the “belly” (taḱi) of the 
chief (Curtis 1915:154,176) (Berman 1991, p.81) 
 
The primary social unit of the Kwakwaka’wakw  was the ŉaḿima, which can be variously 
translated as ‘clan’,’ family group’, or ‘tribal subdivision’.   Boas describes the ŉaḿima as “the 
ultimate units bound together by strict social obligations.” (Boas 1966:37)  The most accurate 
metaphoric translation of the ŉaḿima is the “house”.  I am proposing that one of the major 
metaphors for Kwakwaka’wakw spatial conceptualization is the three level 
expansion/contraction of “the body is a structural and spiritual equivalent to the house; the 
house is a structural and spiritual equivalent to the land; the land is a structural and spiritual 
equivalent to the body.”   This conceptualization rendered an empathetic approach to 
Kwakwaka’wakw ideas of the community (social life) and of the land.   The community is seen 

217 
 
 
as an integral extension of the individual body.  The land is seen as an integral extension of 
both the body and the community.  Individual relationships had a higher definition of social 
placement in that the individual was seen as being a part of a whole social body.  The individual 
is surrounded by family which is surrounded by the ŉaḿima, which is surrounded by the tribe.  
The individual human body is encased within the metaphoric house of the ŉaḿima.   The 
ŉaḿima house/bodies in turn are symbolically contained within the ceremonial house through 
seating arrangements where social obligations are negotiated and played out.  More literally, 
the ceremonial house is conceptually transformed into the universe with the roof representing 
the sky, the floor representing the earth and below the ground representing the land of the 
ghosts; all significant domains of the Kwakwaka’wakw cosmos.   
 
The extended metaphor of the house as the land renders an approach to the landscape which 
is empathetic in nature.  The land is considered an extension of the individual body and family 
group.  My reiteration of this point may appear repetitive but I place a heightened focus on this 
statement as it is the primary proposition of this thesis.   Kwak’wala words introduced in chapter 
3 are emphatic of this sympathetic relationship.

5.3.1 Temporal considerations of the social body       
    
In regards to temporal metaphor Berman gives the following analysis of the concept of “the 
social body in time”.   This analysis renders a structural analogy of the head or front as having 
“precedence in time” and the rear or back as “following in time”   The front or head of the 
ŉamima are represented by the chiefs or highest standing nobility who occupy these positions 
while the lower standings are occupied by the rear or back.  This only makes sense in a 
temporal context if the association between the chiefs and nobility is made as the front or head 
because they are closest in line to the point of origin of the ŉamima (see chapter 3).  According 
to the rules of descent the oldest family lines based on primogeniture are the closest to the 
original ancestor and thus of higher standing.  Younger lines are more distantly associated with 

219 
 
 
the original ancestor and therefore, further away; literally “further away in time.”  She gives the 
following linguistic analysis:  
 
         As noted above, many of the terms for chiefs use the suffix –[g]ame’ “first, in front of, 
ahead” (Boas 1947:360). The common term for “chief”, “gigame’, derives from gig- 
“chief, chiefly,” and  -[g]ame’ “first, in front of.”  The chief is the one in front, but 
before him came the ancestors.  Ancestors are called by many different terms.  
Some are derived from kin terms, including wiẃump, literally “fathers, uncles 
[bilaterally?]” (1910:28) and gagasala, “great-grandparents, and great greatuncles 
[?]” (1921:843).  Many are derived from gal- “first, to be first,” among them gali’ “the 
first one” (1921:223; n.d. 255), and galdzasi bakwam or galdzasi bagwanam “the 
first Indians, the ancient men” (1921:77, 547).  Also from the stem gal- come the 
terms galnukw “belonging to ancestors” (1921:1247), and galgila “to make first 
things, to institute” –what the ancestors did (1909:204).  Still other terms derive from 
the stem gig- “chiefly.”  The most common is gigagiwe’ “chief at the forehead” or 
perhaps, “chief at prow” (1921:842); another is giga’aŉawe’ “chief anchor-line, chief 
root” (1921:843)… 

220 
 
 
         …In the term gigagiwe’ “chief on forehead” we again encounter the analogy 
comparing the ŉamimut to a body.  Here, however, it is a body laid out in time, not 
space.  In time the ancestor stands at the very front and top. (Berman 1991, p.84-
85) 
 
 
Much like the spatial character of contracting and expanding frames from the minute to the 
grandiose (body, house, universe) temporal character also expands and contracts according to 
context.  The current head chief is the temporal equivalent in time to the original ancestor.  If the 
metaphor of the family tree is applied then the chiefs and nobility are those closest to the root 
and are formed by the oldest of the oldest lines.  Younger lines form the outer branches.  In the 
words of a song a Chief uses the metaphor of his body as a tree. 
 
         I am the only great tree, I the chief!  I am the only great tree, I the chief!   You are 
right under me tribes!  You are my younger brothers under me, tribes!  You sit in the 
middle of the rear of the house, tribes!  You surround me like a fence, tribes!  I am 
the first to give you property, tribes!  I am your Eagle, tribes! (Boas 1921, p.1290) 
 

221 
 
 
This speech is imbued with the notion of precedence “that which comes first”.  In this context it 
is the ones who come first in time that are granted the spatial equivalence of being “ahead of” or 
“in front of.”  In this regard Berman observes: 
 
         The ŉaḿimut is portrayed not just as an animal, but also as a tree, which in 
traditional thought was also an animate being.  The chief is ‘uṕik, “post” or “tree,” 
and the chief’s forebears are ‘awaŉawe’, the “root” of the tree.  Commoners are 
bagwałidi’ which means “men of the body,” but also, since the suffix –git found in 
this term can refer to various types of bodies, “Men of the [tree] trunk” (Boas 
1921:836; Hunt to Boas, 2/4/18).  In Hunt’s description, the chief “is the body of a 
walkw or great cedar tree, and the branches of this tree is the tribe of the oṕek 
[,the] chief, Hanging onto the chief body as it is said by the tribes…the 
Gusgamuxw use [the word] oṕek for [the] Post of Heaven that holds up the sky]” 
(letter of Hunt to Boas, 4/11/180.  When a chief and his heir die together, it is as if 
“both tree and root were killed” (Curtis 1915:113) (Berman 1991, p. 83-84) 
 
 

222 
 
 
The metaphor is a spatial one in arranging placement of membership in space, but also if we 
consider the growth cycles of a tree it is a temporal phenomenon that renders first the root and 
trunk and then the branches.  It is because they come first that the root and stem (chiefs and 
nobility formed by the oldest of the oldest) are considered to be integral and of more importance 
in social context.   Consider the following example which is repeated quite often throughout 
Kwakwaka’wakw documented histories. 
 
In some cases we find in a tribe a subdivision which has for its name the stem of the 
tribal name with the ending –am, as in the division just mentioned, the SintἸam and 
dłik’am and outside of the Kwakiutl proper, the Mamalilik’am.  The meaning of this 
ending is “the real ones.”  According to the statement of the Indians there was, in 
former times, in almost each division a noble family that bore a name of this type, 
while the rest of the people were designated by the ordinary name of the division.  
Mythologically this is explained as meaning that the select group, called “the real” 
members of the division, were descended from the ancestor, while the other families 
at an early time became associated with the ancestor without being descended from 
him. 

223 
 
 
On the other hand, according to tradition, several pairs of subdivisions of one sept of 
the Kwakiutl are considered as the descendants of two brothers, one the elder, the 
other of the younger one. (Boas 1944, p. 357) 
 
The concept of primogeniture, or custom of the first born, was so strongly recognized within 
traditional Kwakwaka’wakw society that younger branches often broke off in order to form their 
own ŉaḿima ; or to create “their own house.”  The relationship is one of temporal character with 
that of the oldest and most ancient taking precedence.   In order to consider the significance of 
this concept to Kwakwaka’wakw worldview we need only consider that the reverse has much 
more cultural currency in contemporary Western culture where in many contexts youth and “the 
new” are infused with more value than the aged.   
 
Consistent with the idea of primogeniture the Kwakwaka’wakw social body in time is not 
oriented facing forward to “the future” however, as in many other cultures, but is oriented 
towards the past as we saw in chapter 4. The movement is also cyclical rather than linear as 
explained by the Kwexa (Kwagu’ł) chief Charlie Nowell (1870-1956).  When chiefs give up their 
positions at the head of the ŉaḿima’ they then occupy lower positions.   

224 
 
 
         When I gave the potlatch with the strap from the copper, I changed my name to 
Hamdzidagame, which was the name Lagius gave me, and I gave Alfred the name 
Melide, which means “people are satisfied with olachen grease.”  At the same time, I 
put him in third position in my clan, where I was, and I went to the lower one – the 
ninth.  From then on I received the gifts to him in potlatch myself and took care of 
him, but it was his position just the same.  The same year, at Alert Bay, Johnny 
Whanuk also gave my brother, Owadi, articles for marriage, because my brother 
had married his sister.  With these articles my brother gives a potlatch, calling all the 
same tribes that I called.  At the same time he told all the people that Alfred’s name 
will be “giving away of big coppers,” and my brother put him in number one position 
in our clan, and my brother went down to his other position lower where he had 
another name.  This was the sixth position in our clan, but he continued to get gifts 
for Alfred in the first position and take care of them until Alfred would be old enough 
to take them himself.  If my brother had died before Alfred, then Alfred would have 
been head chief. (Ford 1940, p. 177) 
 

225 
 
 
It is a constantly renewing social body not constantly moving forward in time as we might 
attempt to understand it but rather continually self-perpetuating; a moving forward, then 
stepping back.  Hence, we get metaphoric speeches such as the following: 
 
In all speeches reference is made to the adherence to old customs.  They “walk 
the road made by the creator of chiefs” (kasa lax ťaxalasa gigamegila R790.62); 
they walk in “that which results in the groove of the world” (xwalťalidzam R789.25).  
The chief says, “I follow the road made by my late ancestors” (lan nagałtawix 
ťaxila’yasan wiwomp’woła CIII 124:22) (Boas, 1949, p.238) 
 
An interesting observation is that the word for road in Kwak’wala is the same as that used for 
doorway.   In an alternative metaphor one could say “walking a road” is “entering a house”.   
 
(335)     ťax (ala)                    “door, trail, custom” (Boas 1948:173) 
(336)     ťaxila48                        “to make trail, establish custom” (Boas 1948:173) 
 
In order to perpetuate oneself both individually and in the social body one must have a 
descendent to replace you; preferably a son, a daughter, or a grandchild but in the case of 
                                                 
48 It is quite possible this is the same word as (335).  Boas has two different entries (ťaxala & ťaxila) as does 
the First Voices Kwak’wala website so I have retained them as separate examples. 

226 
 
 
absence of these immediate descendants a more distant relative would suffice.   The imperative 
however lies in the perpetuation.  As membership ages it is replaced by descendants but the 
emphasis is that the descendants are simply a perpetuation of the social body made up of 
individuals from the very beginning.   The importance of this perpetuation is expressed by 
parents and grandparents who refer to their descendants in the following ways: 
 
         …children are addressed as “the one who owns (me) like a dog (‘wadzid).  The 
grandfather calls himself “old dog” (‘wayoł R1313.3).  Parents also call themselves 
“slaves” (ḱaku R712:44); and they call the children “treasures” (długwe’ R712:44). 
(Boas 1944:238) 
 
In this regard Berman in addressing the metaphor of the ŉaḿima as an animate body states: 
 
         This animal is laid out in time as well as moral space; the ancestor is the “chief at 
the forehead” of the animal.  In general, what comes before in time or space is 
chiefly, ancestral; what follows is lower-ranking and contemporary…To which animal 
is the ŉaḿimut being equated?  One answer is the founding spirit-animal, the “first 
one moving in the world,” from which the ŉaḿimut has descended.  Present day 

227 
 
 
ŉaḿimut members, especially the nobles, are “of one kind” through their descent 
from this ancestor.  They are his children; in a sense they are his perpetuated self, 
as is expressed in the eponymous descent-group names.  The chief in and of 
himself perpetuates the ancestor. (Berman 1991, p. 88) 
 
 
This belief is not restricted to the social body or to the nobility but is extended into the general 
belief system of the people as expressed in the following quote from Clellen Ford who 
interviewed Charlie Nowell. 
 
         The Kwakiutl were not much concerned with theorizing about where their children 
came from; in general, they thought of babies as ancestors who had returned to this 
world.  In accordance with this view, it was customary, when a person died, for 
those comforting the survivors to say, “after all, the departed one will come again, 
born to his niece or his granddaughter.”  Proofs of reincarnation were numerous: the 
baby might look like the deceased, he might have a birthmark where the ancestor 
had a scar, or, as an adult he might evince a special skill such as wood carving 
which could only mean that he was an experienced wood carver reborn.  The great 

228 
 
 
number of births which seemed to follow this pattern reinforced the belief and 
insured its persistence. (Ford 1940, p. 29) 
 
In many ways it is difficult to talk about time without making reference to space.  Spatial 
metaphors are used in order to conceptualize time.  The “body in space” appears to be a 
fundamental metaphor for time conceptualization.    In order to understand the importance of 
metaphor for the understanding of societal belief systems Lakoff & Johnson (1999) explain how 
the metaphors “time is a resource” and “time is money” operate in contemporary Western 
culture:  
 
 Our culture happens to have a great many institutions that reify the Time is A 
Resource and Time Is Money metaphors.  One of them is the institution of paying 
people according to the amount of time they work—by the hour or week or year.  
Another is the institution of appointment books, by which time is budgeted.  There 
are also the institutions of time clocks and business hours, which are ways of pairing 
income with time worked.  And of course, there are deadlines, which define the 
limitations of time resources. 

229 
 
 
Not every culture has such institutions, and not every culture has a Time Is A 
Resource metaphor.  According to anthropologist Elizabeth Brandt (personal 
communication) the Pueblos do not even have in their languages a means of 
saying the equivalent of “I didn’t have enough time for that.”  They can say “My 
path didn’t take me there” or “I couldn’t find a path to that,” but those are not 
instances of time being conceptualized as a resource.  The view in which time is 
not considered a resource, in which there is no rush to get things done with 
maximum efficiency, is sometimes viewed mockingly by those who are not part of 
Native American culture as “Indian time.” Western businessmen seeking to set up 
factories in Third World countries often see Indigenous peoples who do not 
conceptualize time as a resource as being lazy.  Part of Westernization is the 
importation of institutions that reify the Time Is A resource and Time As Money 
metaphors (p.165).  
 
 
To be clear, many cultures exhibit space/time crossover for metaphorical understanding of 
temporal experience.  What renders the Kwakwaka’wakw experience of time particular in 
relationship to its spatial metaphors is the concept of expansion and contraction.  While the 

230 
 
 
physical experience of the body in space is mediated by scale from the minute to the grandiose 
reflecting structural similarity, time also expands and contracts based on individual and social 
considerations.   The individual life experience is bounded by a single lifetime which can be 
metaphorically aligned to the span of “a day” or “a year”.  However, the temporal experience is 
expanded to consciously address the inter-generationalism of one’s ancestors and 
descendants.  The boundedness of the single lifetime is expanded to encompass an almost 
infinite experience from the beginning of time through to eternity.  This can be spatially 
compared to the ideas of the bounded independent body in space outwards to encompass the 
expanded social body of the family (ŉaḿima = house) in the world.  This belief system exhibits 
itself through narrative accounts where time (as well as space) is represented as both expanded 
and contracted as in the following examples: 
 
         Now we will talk again about Head-Winter-Dancer (`Tsekame’).  Now his wife, 
Winter-Dance-Woman (`Tsekamaga), was with child.  When she had been with child 
for four months, she gave birth to a boy.  Head-Winter-Dancer said at once to his 
wife, “His name shall be Upper-End (‘Nalbe’).”  

231 
 
 
         Head-Winter-Dancer washed him always in cold water.  When Upper-End was four 
months old he was a full-grown man. (Boas 1902, p. 180) 
 
         This passage illustrates the compression of time in the growth of ‘Nalbe’.  What would normally 
take two decades; the growth of an infant to adult-hood, is accomplished in four months.  In 
another example a chief refers to his original ancestor and then to himself collapsing the 
temporal space between them: 
 
         Immediately, `Kumukwa arose and spoke.  He said, “True chief, true is your word, 
chief Lalakuťsa.  My ancestor, according to the myth from the beginning, 
`NalanukwamgiἸakw came down with supernatural power.  There was nothing that 
he went for in vain when he went into the house of `Kumukwa at `Tsigwaťsi.  Then 
he obtained supernatural power/ all kinds of dancing paraphernalia, the sea-monster 
dance, the killer-whale dance and the /great bullhead, and therefore his name was 
`Tłakwagila and `Kumukwa.  I am ‘NalanukwamgiἸakw. 49(Boas 1925, p. 269)

These are only two examples of many where the temporal passage of time is rendered as 
flexible rather than fixed.   Like space, time can collapse, be compressed and pass quickly or 
can expand.   Rather than being conceptualized as the fixed passage of set amounts, the 
Kwakwaka’wakw perceive time and spatial relationship as flexible and fluid.  In spatial terms a 
body expands to become a house, the house expands to become the world.  In reverse, the 
world compresses and becomes a house and a house is compressed to become an individual 
body; a body which can swallow guests like food.   Time is equally flexible.  A single day is 
likened to a year, or to a lifetime.  The single lifetime of a chief is stretched to encompass all 
time.  These concepts of spatial and temporal analogy are the basis of the empathetic 
relationship between the body, the house and the land/world.  Each are a vital component of the 
other and all are conceptually connected as similar, or the same.  It is from this belief system 
that the rich metaphorical imagination of the Kwakwaka’wakw emerges into artistic expression.   
 
 
5.4  The house metaphor in Speech and Song 
 
The Body=House metaphor can found in ceremonial speech and song.   Consider the following 
speech:  
 

233 
 
 
         Ah, this is our name, tribes!  Ah, this is the great house of our famous one, tribes! –It 
speaks, the great house, your great famous one, tribes!  Like hunger sounds this 
great house, carrying in one hand the tribes all around the world!  It sounds like 
hunger for those at the far end of the world, tribes!  Go on, chief, invite them to come 
to make a turmoil, and to harden the floor of the large house of our chief, tribes! 
(Boas 1921, p. 1279) 
 
 
In this speech the house is given animation through description.  The house carries the other 
tribes in its hand like a person.  The house is hungry like a person.  Hardening the floor of the 
house is a reference to dancing which packs down the floor.  In the next speech a chief refers to 
his guests that he looks for to arrive at his beach as salmon and his village/house a salmon 
weir:  
 
        …and he ran up and stood on the place made for standing on at the top of the 
watchman’s pole.   Then he shaded his eyes with his right hand and stood looking 
seaward.  Then he said aloud, “Ha, ha, ha, hu, wa.”  Then he spoke and said, “My 
schools of salmon are coming to my salmon weir here, chiefs.”  Four times he said 

234 
 
 
thus.  Then spoke one who belonged to the numaym Kukwaḱum of the `Kumuya’yi 
and whose name was Hawalkwalał and said, “Now go on, chief `Tłakudłas, haul in 
hard that you may ascertain what kind of salmon it is that your salmon weir, chief,” 
thus said he. (Boas 1940, p. 234) 
 
The tribes paddling to attend the “potlatch” of the host chief are descibed as salmon which are 
swimming towards  the entrance of a fish weir.  In another speech the salmon weir is likened to 
the ceremonial house and again, the guests as salmon: 
 
“Stand up, Kwagu’ł, that I may call out of the house this chief that he may come and 
look at his guests.”  Thus he said and then he said aloud, “Come chief `Tłasutiwalis, 
now your salmon have come; they have come in great schools,” said he.  And 
immediately `Tłakudłas came out of the door of his house and stood outside.  The 
he put his right hand over his eyes and looked at the canoes that were stopping 
outside.  Then he put down his hand and he spoke and said aloud, “Come, 
`Tłasutiwalis, your salmon has arrived,” said he as he told all the men to beat fast 
time on the front of the house. (Boas 1925:173)  

235 
 
 
Like salmon, the guests to a potlatch provide vital sustenance.   The ceremonial exchange 
between the host chief and his guests is also empathetic in nature.  The chief needs his guests 
as witnesses to validate his ancestral claims, to validate his familial connection to the past, the 
present, and the future through his descendants.  Without them there is no substance to his 
identity.  It is only through communal acknowledgement that his crests and stories carry any 
weight.   Without an audience his speeches and his stories are only words.  It is the validation of 
his guests that bring these stories and crests to life.  The chief and his guests are necessary to 
each other in the same way that sustenance and those whom consume that sustenance 
validate one another.  By eating prey such as animals and fish, humans are able to continue to 
existence physically.  This is the reason for the various prayers before killing or eating.  In 
exchange for their physical bodies the animals and fish are fed spiritually through prayer.  The 
Kwakwaka’wakw world is one of constant transformations and exchange both physical and 
spiritual.  This is also the reason guests are paid.  It acknowledges the social and cultural 
sustenance provided to the chief by their attendance and validation of his social standing 
embodied in artistic and oral performance.  This is the key to understanding the particular 
metaphor of potlatch guests as food.   
 

236 
 
 
The metaphor of “the house is the world” is again prevalent in the following song: 
 
Praise, the killer whale, coming up in the house, 
real in the good house, the chief real (Boas 1985, p. 730) 
 
These words are sung in the ceremonial house.  During a performance the mask of a whale 
would be displayed imitating the breaching motions of whales in the ocean.  Literally, this is 
enacted in the house, but metaphorically it reference the action of whales “in the world” which in 
breaching the surface of the sea are “coming up in the house”; the house floor of the world 
being the surface of the ocean.   Figure 5.10 shows a killer whale dancer with other dancers as 
a part of Edward Curtis’ 1914 silent film “In the Land of the Head Hunters (In the Land of the 
War Canoes)”   The dancers would not normally be seen together this way.  Curtis grouped 
them for dramatic effect.  During real ceremonies the killer whale mask would be performed by 
itself.

In the next song from Boas (1895), wealth is described as a mountain and the importance of the 
idea of origins is also reiterated.  
 

238 
 
 
Tale from the beginning, your tale from the beginning, 
you came up, Your `Kumukwa house came up, 
real wealth is moving, real wealth coming ashore, 
wealth on his back, making a mountain of property, 
great real mountain, your tale from the beginning (p. 673) 
 
 
In this song, the name `Kumukwa refers to the chief of the sea.   In Kwakwaka’wakw histories, 
the house of `Kumukwa is located under the sea, and is made of copper.  Beings who 
encounter this being are gifted with his house and other treasures.   This is the reference to 
“mountains of wealth” which is coming ashore.  All the treasures come from the sea.  In a 
metaphoric sense the sea is the house of `Kumukwa .   The story itself is considered an aspect 
of this wealth and is referred to as “your story from the beginning”. Figure 5.11 is an Edward 
Curtis image of a `Kumukwa mask.   Note the bird on his head which is most often a loon and 
the split whale’s tail near the back of the mask emblematic of its oceanic origin.

The figurative language used in ceremonial speech and song composition are comprehensible 
under the more fundamental metaphoric understanding of the Body=House=Land/World 
metaphor.  
 
5.5  The house metaphor and the structure of button blankets 
The Body=House metaphor concept emerged in the new form of the button blanket.  The 
Kwakwaka’wakw were extremely innovative with the new materials that were introduced with 
contact with European traders.  Prior to contact, clothing and blankets were manufactured by 
hand from cedar and wool, either dog or mountain goat. (Jonaitis, 2006)   When wool trade 
blankets were introduced on the coast the Kwakwaka’wakw quickly took to wearing them and 
using them as a form of ceremonial currency.   In Figure 5.12, a photo taken in Quatsino Sound, 
wool trade blankets are hung around the house adorned with buttons and paper currency.

By the latter parts of the 19th century ceremonial trade blankets adorned with trade buttons were 
being manufactured as potlatch gifts and ceremonial regalia.  Though museum collectors shied 
away from these innovations due to their own concerns over cultural authenticity the button 
blankets were completely traditional in their conceptualization.   The blankets functioned both as 
regalia worn over the body, and as two-dimensional expressions of crest lineages.  While 

242 
 
 
Figures 5.12  and 5.14 show the blankets in two-dimensional display Figure 5.13 shows men 
wearing button blankets at the potlatch of Thomas and Charlie Nowell held in Alert Bay in 1900.  
Note the particular overlapped way with exposed left shoulder the man on the far left wears his 
blanket. 
 
There is a theory articulated by George McDonald, former director of the Canadian Museum of 
Civilization that the blankets “replicated housefronts, but they changed the dimensions of 
meaning by reversing them…and changing the frame of reference from the social (the painted 
housefront) to the personal (articles of clothing). (Jenson, 1986, p. 1)  This theory was also told 
to me years ago by my uncle Ernie Willie when we started to make button blankets for our 
potlatches.   The theory is that the red borders are the sides and roof of a house.  The break in 
the middle at the top is where the main smoke-hole is in traditional house architecture.   The 
crest is considered the spirit of the house and functions much like the crest on the front of a 
house or on its house-posts.    The symbols sewn onto the borders of blankets tend to depict 
natural elements pertinent to the territory of the ‘naḿima (clan/house) or tribe depicted.   For 
example, the triangular forms on the border of the blanket worn by the man with exposed 
shoulder symbolize mountains.

The connection between the body and the house is pronounced in the concept of the button 
blanket.  The blanket covers the body as does the house.  Its two-dimensional layout mimics the 
architecture of a house.  The red color of the border is said to represent blood and the red cedar 
bark of the Kwakwaka’wakw winter ceremonial.

In Figure 5.14 the blanket has been hung upside down but the basic composition of borders 
along top and bottom and the main crest in the centre is still evident.  The invention of button 
blankets is a significant example where the internal cultural meaning, or concept remains intact 
but is interpreted in a new formal expression using new materials.  The object as a blanket 

245 
 
 
performs the same conceptual function as the traditional house in providing a cover for the body 
while simultaneously asserting historical lineage. 
   
5.6 Summary  
The analogy of the body as a structural equivalent between objects and beings from the small-
scale to the large scale permeates Kwakwaka’wakw cultural practice as well as language.   The 
structure of the body, as the house of the soul, is analogically expanded to the structure of a 
house, which is the container for the individual body, or the family unit.  This spatial 
conceptualization of expansion and contraction is consistent with Kwakwaka’wakw concepts 
regarding temporal flow.   Rather than considering time as an ever progressive succession of 
individual linear events Kwakwaka’wakw time is considered as a cyclical perpetuation of a 
single moment that expands and contracts through ceremonial repetition (Walens 1977; 
Nicolson 2005).  Spatial forms are simply repetitions/reflections of one another that are 
experienced on an ever increasing or decreasing scale in relationship to the human body.  From 
this emerges the major conceptual metaphor Body=House=Land/World.  This chapter has 
presented evidence within Kwakwaka’wakw cultural expression that manifests this metaphor.  In 
particular this chapter focussed on the “house” as in intermediary between the body and the 

246 
 
 
landscape and how the house is conceived of, imagined and perpetuated in Kwakwaka’wakw 
culture.   The next chapter will focus on Kwakwaka’wakw conceptualization of the land.

Chapter 6: Laxa awiŉagwis’ “On the Land” 
Kwakwaka’wakw Geographic Space 
 
 
Dream of Malidi 
I dreamed I was going to the upper world, which was very beautiful.  Then I saw 
many people and all of them seemed to be women.  One of them came to me and 
spoke to me and advised me never to speak a lie, “for I know that you always lie 
when you talk about the feasts that you give to your tribe in the country down below.  
If you go on talking this way you will fare ill with our chief here when he judges you.  
And you shall not steal your brother’s property and you shall not hate your fellow 
men.  If you obey what I tell you will have no reason to fear,” thus she said to me.  
Then she asked me to go home.  She opened the rear door of the house and I went 
out, and when I looked up I saw my house.  Then I awoke.” (Boas 1925, p.51) 
 
6.1 Land and sea / upriver - downriver 
When we talk about geography we are talking about the lay of the land.  Much of this is 
considered to be absolute.  Places are fixed in spatial relationship to one another.  However, 
perspective plays an integral role in our conceptualization of geography.  While our physical 

248 
 
 
bodies can observe from certain points aspects of the landscape it is beyond our human 
observational capability to observe all of the earth at once.  So humans have developed 
conventions, such as cartography (mapmaking), that allow us to understand space within the 
landscape.  Each culture has developed their own set of conventions to help them both 
conceptualize the landscape and to navigate it.  The conceptualization of geographic space, as 
described through the Kwak’wala language is based on the division of the land and the sea and 
the occupation of village sites within the intermediate zone between them.  This primary division 
is given further definition by a secondary application loosely defined as up-river/down-river.  
This chapter deals with the primary and secondary geographic orientation systems in an attempt 
to elucidate the self-contained and high cultural relevance of the Kwakwaka’wakw system.  The 
body and the house are used as a structural prototype for the Kwakwaka’wakw spatial 
understanding of the land. The body/house is the central location off of which the primary 
regions of ťłas- in front of (seaward), atł “behind (towards the forest)”, ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver” and 
gwa- “downriver” are derived. The body/house is also used to map structural characteristics 
onto the description of the landscape rendering a culturally amplified animation.  The regions 
the sky, the earth (house) and below the ground are also significant.  
 

249 
 
 
6.1.1 Prior Research 
Prior research has attempted to translate the absolute geographic orientation words of “north, 
south, east and west” onto Kwakwaka’wakw geographic terms with varying results.  The earliest 
recorded European contact dates for the Kwakwaka’wakw territories are placed within the late 
18th Century.  In 1786, James Strange, a British ship trader visited what is now called Queen 
Charlotte Straight.  In 1792, American, British and Spanish ships also travelled the territory 
(Codere, 1990; Menzies, 1923, Galois, 1994).  These traders documented to some degree the 
geographic aspects of the lands they were travelling for their own purposes.  It was not until 
nearly a full century later that a documentation of the understanding of Kwakwaka’wakw 
geographic perspective was attempted by outsiders.  In 1885, the celebrated Canadian 
geologist George M. Dawson (1849-1901) travelled through Kwakwaka’wakw territory and 
collected a small selection of nine geographical terms published in 1885.   Twenty years later, 
Edward S. Curtis also recorded a limited vocabulary of what he called “cardinal points” which 
was published in 1915.   In some ways, Curtis’ work overlaps with Dawson’s in relaying primarily 
the directions of the wind.

While these minor references represent the earliest published accounts of Kwakwaka’wakw 
geographical concepts it is of course, Franz Boas in collaboration with George Hunt who 
provided the most comprehensive engagement in the 1934 publication “Geographical Names of 
the Kwakiutl Indians”.  This 83 page Boas & Hunt text contains an introductory essay which 
outlines the meaning of geographic names and then provides an index of example suffixes that

express location.  This information is followed by examples of names that are significant in the 
mythologies.  Of these he chooses a few out of the vast amount of mythological texts that he 
along with George Hunt collected.  This includes a list of origin sites for tribes and ‘naḿima.  
Unfortunately, the list is not complete.  The body of the publication also includes a list of place 
names that is completed by a set of 22 maps to which those place names are attached.  
 
Since Boas and Hunt, the most comprehensive contemporary published text to deal with 
Kwakwaka’wakw geography is Robert Galois’ (1994) “Kwakwaka’wakw Settlements, 1775-1920 
A Geographical Analysis and Gazetter”.  It provides maps, place names and in some but not all 
cases origin stories.  The impetus for this book came from the combining of the research of 
Franz Boas with that of Wilson Duff.  As an anthropologist working for the University of British 
Columbia and then later the Provincial Museum, now called the Royal British Columbia 
Museum, Duff had acquired vast amounts of geographic information on the Kwakwaka’wakw in 
the 1950’s before his premature death in 1976.  Much of his work remained unpublished and in 
the 1980’s as an initiative of the U’mista Cultural Society, perhaps anticipating future land claims 
processes, Robert Galois, a historical geographer, was hired to review the materials and publish 
a manuscript.    To quote Galois: 

252 
 
 
         Just as Wilson Duff felt that Northwest Coast Native art could not be appreciated 
without understanding the cultural logic that motivated it, we have argued that the 
story of Kwakwaka’wakw land requires an appreciation of Kwakwaka’wakw culture.  
For the Kwakwaka’wakw, thinking about land involves knowing what group or 
family claims and has the right to use it, knowing its resources, and finally knowing 
how to use those resources.   This book can certainly be used without appreciating 
the distinctive cultural values and thoughts of the Kwakwaka’wakw.  But to do so is 
to pass up a chance to view the story of the lands of the Kwakwaka’wakw through 
their own eyes. (p. 11) 
 
While the book is a valuable contemporary contribution to Kwakwaka’wakw geography and 
certainly the idea of a Kwakwaka’wakw perspective was given consideration the actual 
engagement with that perspective is limited to topical considerations of inclusion.  The 
fundamental structure and delineation of the material remains within Western academic 
parameters and despite the above mentioned desire to present a Kwakwaka’wakw perspective 
on land the text falls short of accomplishing this.  Galois admits an awareness of this as his 
introductory statement reveals: 

253 
 
 
         Nonetheless, I came to the study of the contact process as a White male and 
sometimes academic.  Both my reading of the evidence and my presentation of 
the findings have been conditioned by this background.  I know that in some 
respects the results violate Kwakwaka’wakw sensibilities.  The geographical 
organization of the gazetteer, for example, makes little sense from a 
Kwakwaka’wakw perspective.  The tribes of course should be presented in the 
rank order of the feast rather than by location. (p.xv)  
 
Despite being 60 years older, Boas’ 1934 analysis comes closer to engaging with the internal 
Kwakwaka’wakw cultural perspective on land than Galois.  Boas accomplishes this through the 
inclusion of a linguistic analysis.  The linguistic analysis provides invaluable insight into the 
conceptualization of the landscape and the occupation of territory than Galois is able to provide 
in just delineating territory, mapping it and providing origin stories.  Boas applies the idea that 
how a people talk about a subject reflects how they think about it and so provides a linguistic 
breakdown of how geography is given specific Kwak’wala terminology and hence 
Kwakwaka’wakw perspective.  That being said, the presentation format of both works are 
consistant to the training and interests of both authors and are therefore not unexpected. 

254 
 
 
When we think of maps we are conditioned in modern times to assume an aerial perspective.  
As a convention this is the primary perspective that has been derived of the relationship 
between landscape and space.  Without the visual interpretation of aerial mapping how would 
we perceive of the spatial layout of the land?  This is the question I want to engage with most.  
What were the conventions contained within the Kwakwaka’wakw mind that allowed an image of 
the land in space to be conceptualized and what forms did that take?  These Kwakwaka’wakw 
conventions emerge from both the specific topographic character of the land the 
Kwakwaka’wakw occupy and the lifestyle of the people.  The forms ultimately are embedded in 
the way that people speak about the land and their place within it.  This knowledge, this way of 
knowing, is embedded in Kwak’wala linguistic terminology.   Boas prioritized this information in 
his collection and analysis of Kwakwaka’wakw geographic data and then translated it into 
modern European style mapping.   I will include here a brief description of the landscape 
occupied by the Kwakwaka’wakw and then move on to describe from a linguistic point of view 
the conventions applied by Kwak’wala speakers in conceptualizing and navigating this 
geography.  I will borrow Boas’ description as it covers the basic details of the geographic 
terrain quite sufficiently. 
 

255 
 
 
        The region inhabited by these people is a mountainous coast intersected by 
innumerable sounds and fiords and studded with islands, large and small.   Thus 
intercourse along the coast by means of canoes is very easy, while access to the 
inland is difficult on account of the rugged hills and the density of the woods.  A 
few fiords cut deep into the mainland, and the valleys which open into them give 
access to the heart of the high ranges which separate the coast from the 
highlands of the interior, forming an effectual barrier between the people of the 
interior and those of the coast. (Boas 1966, p. 7) 
 
6.2   North, south, east or west? 
Researchers in the Kwak’wala language encountered variations in conceptual models when 
attempting to understand Kwakwaka’wakw geographic terminology.  The conceptual model 
expressed by the terms “north, south, east and west” as absolute cardinal points assists modern 
geographic comprehension and goes back hundreds of years in Western based understanding.  
It seems natural to attempt to map Kwakwaka’wakw geographic terms onto these fixed 
directions and every researcher who has addressed the topic has attempted to do this.  
However, this cannot be accomplished because the “north, south, east and west” conceptual 

256 
 
 
model and the geographic conceptual model that emerges from the Kwak’wala language do not 
map accurately and are in fact substantially different.  In order to understand Kwakwaka’wakw 
geographical concepts it is better to give up the convention of “north, south ,east and west” 
altogether and accept that the cardinal concepts for geographic orientation are completely 
autonomous and attempt to understand them on their own merits.  This being said all of the 
texts dealing with Kwak’wala geographic space have attempted to map Kwak’wala terms onto 
the “north, south, east, and west” convention, including Boas (1934 &1948), Dawson (1885), 
Curtis (1915) and Grubb (1977). The idea within this next chapter is not to toss out altogether 
the prior linguistic attempts but to be aware of the process and understand that the English 
linguistic terms are not true equivalents but merely attempts by researchers to understand 
Kwak’wala terms through an English prototype.   Hopefully by the end of the chapter the 
structure of the concept of geographic space as expressed in the Kwak’wala language can 
begin to be understood “on its own terms”. 
 
6.2.1 “The landscape” in Kwak’wala 
A first language Kwak’wala speaker is not born into a world of ‘north, south, east and west’.  
One needs to throw this concept out and learn the way a Kwak’wala speaker would.  As a 

257 
 
 
Kwakwaka’wakw child, while learning how to speak Kwak’wala the elementary geographic 
terms applied to the landscape around the developing individual divided the environment into 
the land and the sea.  This is the primary orientation for the Kwakwaka’wakw.   This seems 
logical given that the Kwakwaka’wakw traditionally occupied the beach areas intermediate 
between these two primary allocations.  This concept is embedded in the Kwak’wala language.  
It is expressed by the stems atł- “inland, forest region” and `tłas- “seaward, or ocean region”.

The body in space is primarily identified with a house, or community that faces the water. It 
could be proposed that it is the body, marked by the u-[a’w-] stem that is situated as the central

spatial locator off of which the other four directions are derived in order to conceptualize the 
landscape.   The prototype of the body is then marked by the u-[a’w-] stem which is then 
extended to the house and to the landscape rendering them conceptually analogous or “a 
category”.  This would account for the large body of words having to do with the body, the house 
and the land, which are prefaced with the u-[a’w-] stem as explained in chapter 3. If we consider 
the notion that the body, the house, the land are containers (as are bowls and canoes) then we 
could say that the body is a container for the soul, the house is a container for the body, and the 
land is a container for houses, or communities.    
 
In Figure 6.1 these zones are diagrammatically mapped.   Figure 6.2 and 6.3 are photographic 
illustrations of how Kwakwaka’wakw villages are located within the intermediate zone between 
the forest and the sea/river.  The first image is of Gwayasdams village situated on Gilford Island, 
the second image is of Gwa’yi village located in Kingcome Inlet.  Note the position of the houses 
facing the river with water in front and woods in behind.

The central zone is occupied by the body (house) with two primary zones extending outwards 
from the front, towards the sea/river and outwards from behind, towards the forest.  To some 
degree this is a locally fixed orientation based on the location of land, sea and beach.   Boas 
(1934) has an awareness of this and provides a brief description in his 1934 publication.  He 

261 
 
 
describes it as “…inland, away from sea or river; and seaward, away from land; are the principal 
directions which appear commonly in geographical terms” (p. 9).  Figure 6.4 shows the 
secondary primary orientation stems ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver” and gwa- “downriver”: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                      
                                    Figure 6.4  ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver”, gwa- “downriver                   
                Based on a village residing on right side of river, left side directions reverse 
 
The secondary cardinal orientation can be described as an upriver, downriver dichotomy.  It is 
expressed by the stems gwa- “downriver” and ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver”.   Boas describes this 
orientation in the following way:  “Instead of the points of the compass they orient themselves 
according to the direction of the coastline or rivers.  Down river and down along the coast (in the 
sense of northward or westward); upriver and up the coast (in the sense of southward or 
Houses face

Beach 
Woods 
Water 
gwa- downriver 
‘nal- upriver 

262 
 
 
eastward)” (p.9)  Note that he still attempts to map the orientation onto Western cardinal 
direction albeit loosely by applying the preface “…in the sense of…”.   If we take these two 
major principles of orientation from Figure 6.1 and 6.4 and apply them together we get the major 
conceptual construction of geographic spatial orientation from a Kwak’wala speaker’s point of 
view.  I cannot emphasize enough however the need to understand these orientation 
configurations on their own merit away from any type of attempt to apply them to a Western 
‘north, south, east and west’ prototype; for to do so is to ultimately fail to understand the 
Kwakwaka’wakw mindset, literally, on its own terms.  I will however, explain later in the chapter 
why the ‘north, south, east and west’ prototype does not function well after explaining the 
working features of Kwak’wala geographic orientation in and of themselves.  Figure 6.5 shows 
the four cardinal directions of the Kwakwaka’wakw, both primary atł- “towards the woods”, ťłas- 
“towards the sea”, and secondary, gwa- “downriver”, ŉal-[‘nal-] “upriver”.

                      Figure 6. 5 atł- “towards the woods”, ťłas- “towards the sea”,  
                                       gwa- “downriver”, ŉal-[‘nal-] “upriver” 
 
While Boas designates the four directional stems as carrying similar referential weight I have 
designated the seaward/landward dichotomy as primary and the up-river/down-river dichotomy 
as secondary.  My reason for doing so emerges from the nature of the Pacific Northwest coastal 
typography and the occupational zone of the beach.  If you imagine the developing awareness 
of a child within this environment the most obvious primary zones are the sea/river and the 
forest.  The primary orientation of the traditional house is to face the water.  This makes 
practical sense if one is travelling by water and approaching the home from the beach53.   The 
                                                 
53 Having lived in Gwa’yi Village along the river I fully understand the practical need for the house main 
entrance to face the river while carrying all my groceries and gear up from the beach.  In Kingcome the 
traditional houses all faced the water.  It was not until the replacement of traditional houses with single 
family western style houses that the format of houses facing a central street began to be implemented.  
My mother’s contemporary house now faces the main road and away from the river.  In order to access

sea/river is in front of the home while the forest is in back of the home.  The developing 
consciousness of space outside the home in the developing Kwakwaka’wakw child can easily 
make this division as it remains fixed in relationship to the body and the house.  The 
upriver/downriver dichotomy is slightly more sophisticated in its application due to a more 
relative or flexible application.  The application is relative to moveable objects in space within 
the community.  Downriver is only downriver relative to the subject being discussed.  For 
example, old villages usually build their homes along a shoreline making for a row or rows of 
houses facing the water.  If your house is the third house from the lower part of the village then 
you are downriver from the remaining seven houses that are upriver from you but you are 
upriver from the remaining two houses that exist downriver from you.  If your location within the 
village is changed to house seven for example, then houses one thru six are down-river from 
you and only houses eight to ten are now upriver.  Figure 6.6 attempts to demonstrate this 
relative positioning. 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
the main entrance when arriving home on the river we must walk around to the front of the house which in 
traditional Kwakwaka’wakw orientation is actually the back (atłana’we’).

                                  Figure 6.6  Relative positioning of upriver/downriver 
This relative flexible orientation from within the expanded sphere of the village renders a slightly 
more sophisticated application than the more limited location of the body in the house presented 
by the front/back orientation of the land/sea dichotomy.  In other words the fixed or absolute 
‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver” 
gwa- “downriver" 
                                                                        ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver” 
gwa- 
“downriver" 
 

266 
 
 
nature of the land/sea dichotomy renders it primary while the relative nature of the 
upriver/downriver dichotomy renders it secondary.  Also, while the terms “upriver” and 
“downriver” are specific to river based communities “towards the water” and “towards the land” 
are maintained for all communities both river and island based. 
 
To add another layer of understanding to this flexibility in conceptualization of space let us 
consider the words for ‘house’ and ‘community’ in Kwak’wala.   The word for “house” in 
Kwak’wala is gukw “to live in a house” is gukwala and gukwaἸas is “house where one lives or 
where you live”.  Another extension of gukw- includes the word gukwaluť which means ‘tribe’.  It 
is literally the extension from the independent single house to the groups of houses that 
represent the village groups living along the shoreline.  The extended identification of the term 
gukwaluť , with the self, is highlighted by the existence of an alternative term for ‘tribe’ 
lilkwalatłe’ meaning “other tribes outside of one’s own”.   Lilkwalatłe’ literally translates as 
“having fires moving on the water” which describes the other tribes arriving on the water to visit 
one’s own community (Boas, 1966).  Addressing the previous discussion of primary and 
secondary axis of orientation it follows then that the singular gukw  facing the water is primary 

267 
 
 
and the extension of gukwalu`t  “tribe” to one’s own village influences the nature of the 
secondary orientation of upriver/downriver. 
 
There is also a degree of expansion and contraction that occurs in conceptualizing the body in 
space.  The conceptualization of the independent body represented by the house gukw is 
expanded to encompass the tribe/village gukwalu’t while maintaining its fixed orientation to the 
land and sea.  Relationships within this expanded and contracted concept of the body in space 
are considered relative under the upriver/downriver axis.  In an interesting linguistic formal 
analogy the word gukw  itself exhibits expansion when joined with the suffix –aluť expanding the 
singular concept of the “house” gukw  to the plural concept of “the fellow inhabitants of the 
house” gukwaluť.     
 
Taking this into consideration, the Kwakwaka’wakw initial geographical understanding is 
anchored by the body (independent self) and the house which is then applied to the primary 
orientation of land and sea, with the body/house facing the water.  The secondary geographical 
spatial orientation utilizes an expanded notion of the self “within the community” and is applied 
to upriver/downriver concepts.   By this, I mean the upriver/downriver orientation is applied 

268 
 
 
relative to where one is presently , i.e. located within the village.  The cardinal directions for the 
Kwakwaka’wakw are not based on “north, south, east and west” but the stems atł-, ťłas-, gwa- 
and ‘nal-[‘nal-]. 
 
6.3 The primary geographical division of the stems atł- “land region” and ťłas- “sea 
region”  
 
The following are a general selection of words reflecting the geographic notions contained within 
the stems atł- “landwards, forest region” and ťłas- “seaward, ocean/water region” from Boas 
1948 unpublished dictionary and 1934 “Geographical Names of the Kwakiutl Indians”. 
 
atł- (adł- before schwa initial suffixes54) 
(337)     atłi                             “the woods, forest” (www.firstvoices.com) 
(338)     adłige’                       “back of anything” (www.firstvoices.com) 
(339)     adłabała                    “pointing inland, trail leading inland (Boas 1948:18) 
(340)     adłabe’                      “inland end” (Boas 1948:18) 
(341)     adłagila                     “to go into woods” (Boas 1948:18) 
                                                 
54 The atł- changes to adł- due to the phonological influence of the following shwa (a) 

269 
 
 
(342)     adłagamala               “facing inland” (Boas 1948:18)

(344)     atłagam’la                    “facing inland” (Boas 1934:39) 
 
ťłas- 
(345)     ťłasadzi                         “seaside” (Boas 1934:82) 
(346)    ťłasa’la                            “seaward rock” (Boas 1934:82) 
(347)    ťłasbe’                            “seaward point” (Boas 1934:82) 
(348)    ťła`tłasa’aka                    “to go seaward” (Boas 1948:442) 
(349)    ťłasagwił                          “bedroom on sea-side of house” (Boas 1948:442) 
(350)    ťłasudis                            “sea side of world” (Boas 1948:442) 
(351)    ťłasułala                           “to come from woods going towards beach” (Boas 1948:442) 
 
Of particular interest is the extension of atł- to the general meaning of “behind.”  
 
(352)    ‘Angwuxda atła’yex loł?                             “Who is behind you? ( 27/04/13)

              The  DEF       children              at     behind     the   house                  (27/04/13) 
 

270 
 
 
(354)    La’am atłis’tax gukwas Baba laxa gukwdzi.   
                 Then     behind moved the  house of Baba to the  bighouse  
                                          “They moved Baba’s house behind the bighouse” (27/04/13) 
 
(355)    He’am atłaye’da `kwas’tax laxa hanayu.     “The cup is behind the kettle.” (27/04/13) 
             There       behind  the          cup     the   kettle 
 
 
The extension of ťłas- to the meaning “in front of” is less prevalent in contemporary speech as 
atł- to “behind” but still exists in the older texts collected by George Hunt for Franz Boas. 
 
           Wa, a’mis la axalilam lax ťłasaxdza’ma’yi sa tłi’lanami.  Wa, a’amxa’a’wise la

           They are just put down in front of the guests.  And the oil dish is also put down 
            in front of what is to be eaten. (Boas 1921, p. 312)

           …the man takes the long food mat and spreads it in front of his guests and after 
            he has spread it, he takes up the dishes and places them in front of his  
            guests;… (Boas 1909, p. 442) 
 
 
The following are terms pertinent to the structure of the house. 
 

271 
 
 
(356)    atłanowe’                     “back of the house”  (09/16/11) 
(357)    ťłasanowe’                   “outside front of house” (Grubb 1977:76) 
(358)    adłaxsa                        “to go through the back door” (Boas 1948:18) 
(359)    atłala’as                       “something behind house” (Grubb 1977:158) 
(360)    adłabiłťsa’                    “behind inside on floor” (Boas 1948:18) 
(361)     ťłasagwił                     “bedroom on sea-side of house” (Boas 1948:442) 
 
The following are contrasting terms of particular cultural significance.  Example (352) “land food” 
can be contrasted against example (352) “sea food”.  Each word relates to the region of land or 
sea.  These words are a selection of words which emphasize the delineation of the primary 
regions of forest and sea. 
 
(362)    adłaḱanam                   “land food, i.e. roots, berries” (Boas 1948:18)

The relationship between static regions and motion i.e. “direction towards” is complex.  Consider 
the example (376) which expresses a motion towards the woods from the position of being on 
water.   
 
(374)     ťłas`kinuxw                      “tribal name” (Boas 1948:442

                woods- to cause an action  
 
 
Of particular interest is a ceremonial dance called the atła’kam  “the dance of the woods” (see 
example 366).  This dance is said to have its origin in the forest and the many characters that 
are depicted represent the forest creatures, both plant and animal.  A variety of creatures are 
called by Ximsaliłalas,  the main grouse dancer, out from the back room of a ceremonial house 
onto the dance floor. Significant to the metaphor of the House=Land/World is the first creature 
called out by Ximsaliłalas which is named `Tłaťłapalalagalis “Door-Keeper-of-the-Woods”.  In 
contemporary versions of this dance performed in Kingcome Inlet I was taught that this being 
comes out first and symbolically each creature then passes by “Door-Keeper-of-the-Woods” in 
order to take their place on the floor. (Johnny Moon, personal communication).  Boas (1921) 
gives an account of how this dance was acquired by the Gixsam ‘naḿima of the Naḱwaxda’xw 
tribe of Blunden Harbour and the Awiḱinuxw of Rivers Inlet.  In it the “Door-Keeper-of-the-
Woods is called as the twenty-seventh dancer out of forty who have names such as “Stump-of-
the-Woods”, “Laughing-Woman-of-the-Woods”, “One-Side-Moss-of-the-Woods”.    The 

274 
 
 
name`Tłaťłapalalagalis is curious in that the stem ťła- refers to the sea.  We could interpret this 
as meaning “in the direction of the sea from the woods”.  Figure 6.7 illustrates in a photo the 
house that the dancers of the aťłakam emerge from as well as the caller Ximsaliłalas.

6.4 The secondary geographical orientation of ‘nal-[‘nal-]  “upriver” and gwa- “downriver” 
 
Boas describes the phonological conditions for the different forms of “upriver” in his 1948 
Dictionary as ‘nal- having a full vowel /a/ before vowels and ‘nal- having a schwa before 
consonants.  He gives the general meaning as “upstream, south, east”.  In Boas (1931) he

describes the stem in the following way; “The Kwakiutl expresses by the stem ‘na- light, sky, 
world, dawn, south” In  his 1947 Grammar he describes the stem ‘nala as “up river, south, 
world” (p.228). The following are a selection of words derived from this stem:

words derived from this stem.

Both Boas and Grubb identify the stem ‘nal-[‘nal-] as referencing the directions south or in some 
cases east.   Boas (1934) describes this as “up river and up the coast (in the sense of 
southward or eastward)”(p. 9)   The stem gwa- is associated with the north and sometimes the 
west.   These associations have been applied because in some specific cases it does coincide, 
but if gwa- north is equated with downriver and ‘nal-[‘nal-] south with upriver it fails.  North and 

280 
 
 
south do not always align with the upriver/downriver orientations though east and west quite 
often do.  For instance, if we take the village of Gwa’yi in Kingcome inlet as an example the 
village is situated on the left lower portion of the Kingcome River facing the direction of the inlet.  
The village faces the river, giving it a westward orientation.   The fixed compass orientations of 
north and south are then opposite to the directions of up river, down-river.   In this particular 
case ťłas- is west, atł- is east, gwa- as “downriver” is actually heading southwest, and ‘nal-[‘nal-] 
as “up river” is actually heading northeast.   Relatively, depending on the bends in the river 
course a good village site could be situated facing any of the four fixed cardinal directions.    
Boas 1934 description of  ‘nal-[‘nal-] as “in the sense of southward or eastward” and gwa- “in the 
sense of northward or westward” references this flexibility in direction.   It is also alluded to in 
Dawson‘s (1885) definitions: 
 
(430)    ‘naldzi’                           “south east” (Dawson 1885:33) 
(431)    gwenakw                       “north west” (Dawson 1885:33) 
 
In Kwakwaka’wakw territory most coastal rivers (Kingcome Inlet, Knights Inlet, Bute Inlet etc.run 
from an eastern origin towards a western outflow towards the ocean.   In the case of Vancouver 

281 
 
 
Island river systems can run in either an eastward direction towards Queen Charlotte Straight 
(the Nimpkish River for example) or westward toward the Pacific Ocean (Quatsino Sound for 
example).  We can see then that even when the definitions “south” and “north” are broadened to 
“southward” or “eastward” they remain insufficient definitions to convey the integral meaning of 
the stems gwa- and ‘nal-[‘nal-].  In order to better understand these stems we must look at the 
definitions separate from each other.   Upriver and downriver must be taken literally as a river 
based axis and the application of north and south considered independently as a coastal axis.

 From this example we can see that the Western fixed absolutes of north and south are not a 
sufficient definition of what ‘nal-[‘nal-] and gwa- mean.  In some cases north and south will be

accurate but in many others they will not be.  This is why I mentioned earlier in the text that we 
must try as best as possible to ignore these definitions and attempt to understand the stem 
meanings “in and of themselves”.   This seems somewhat difficult given that the above lists are 
heavily reliant on the attempt to correlate Western absolute cardinal directions but certainly 
possible if we keep in mind that it is merely an attempt  to map Western concepts onto 
Kwakwaka’wakw concepts.  In a general sense the concepts of north, south, east and west can 
be applied but the conceptual framework that emerges from within the Kwak’wala language will 
fail to be understood. Our change of focus is to attempt the reverse and understand the 
Kwakwaka’wakw concepts as they are expressed in the Kwak’wala language. 
  
To do this let’s consider the two primary meanings expressed by the terms ‘nal-[‘nal-] and gwa- .   
We have seen previously that the general definition provided has been ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver, 
south” and (gwa-) “downriver, north”.   The most broadly expressed definitions for the stem  
’nal-[‘nal-] can be found in Boas’ 1931 paper published in the International Journal of American 
Linguistics  “ The Kwakiutl expresses by the stem ‘na- light, sky, world, dawn, south “(p.165).  In 
his 1947 Kwakiutl Grammar   Boas also gives the definition ‘na’la  “up river, south, world; before 
consonants ‘nal- “ (Boas 1947:228).   The extensions alluded to within the broad definition 

283 
 
 
notably include the concepts of “light”, “sky”, “dawn” and “world” in addition to “upriver” and 
“south”.   These extensions give us a better idea as to the conceptualization of the term 
’nal-[‘nal-] in that they provide additional context.  In comparison gwa- does not appear to have 
similar conceptual extension.  The definitions are limited to “downriver, north”.  If we examine 
the correspondent meanings found within the stem ‘nal-[‘nal-] meaning “upstream, upriver” and 
the stem gwa- what we find is an orientation taken from the fixed location of the village or a 
position within the village.  It has no direct correlation to any particular fixed direction of north or 
south.  
 
However, if the orientation is reconfigured to the coastline of the Pacific Ocean we can 
 achieve the definitions of north and south.   Now, the focus of orientation has expanded from 
that of a village along a riverbank to that of a geographically broadened coastal occupation.  
This change in orientation is emphasized by a contemporary Kwak’wala speaker in the following 
way. 
 

284 
 
 
         “Here we go again with “Where is so and so?” and the reply is “Li ’nalkila.”65  
Somebody went to Vancouver and then you ask where this other person is. “Li 
gwesta li laxa ‘Awikinuxw. Li gwakila.”  And if you’re in the village, like Kingcome, 
you say the same thing if they were to inquire about somebody  “Oh, li laxa ‘naldzi’. 
Upriver.  And then this other person “Li laxa ‘uxwsiwa’e.” Mouth of the river. So we 
say “gwenakw” when you’re going up north. Cause River’s Inlet is north of Alert Bay, 
Kingcome and Gilford, Port Hardy but you say “Li laxa gwenakw.” Or if you’re going 
to Prince Rupert, “Li laxa gwenakw  gwołali.  But when you’re in the river like 
Kingcome “gwoła”, you’re going south.” (08/11) 
 
 
The name given to the city of Vancouver by the informant is ‘Nalkila.   It came to be used as a 
proper name though ‘nalkila, in general refers to a southward coastal orientation from 
Kwakwaka’wakw coastal territory.  His reference to the ‘Awikinuxw refers to the people from 
Rivers Inlet which is north from Kwakwaka’wakw territory (Alert Bay, Kingcome Inlet, Gilford 
Island, Port Hardy).  Here he uses the word gwakila, meaning “north”.   He then refers to Prince 
                                                 
65 Li ‘nalkila. translates as “gone to Vancouver, or in the direction of Vancouver (south).  Li is an auxiliary 
with the meaning movement away from the point of focus, or the position of the speaker.  It will be dealt 
with in a later chapter.  

285 
 
 
Rupert which is even further north than Rivers Inlet. The speaker emphasizes the contextual 
distinction between ‘nal- and gwa- usage within a river based axis versus a coastal. 
  
 
(432)    Li laxa gwenakw gwołali66       “Having gone even further north.” (08/2011) 
 
                  go to the      north            further    
  
                  
 
 
                       Figure 6.9  Coastal map showing orientations of ‘nalkila and gwakila 
                                                 
66 -w’oł or ‘oł is the past tense suffix meaning “far distant in the past” or “having passed out of existence”. In 
this case there appears to be a temporal/spatial relationship relating to distance “farther”. 

286 
 
 
The ‘nal-[‘nal-] “south” and gwa- “north” definitions hold true in the majority of coastal 
orientations as in the following examples derived from a contemporary speaker: 
 
         Speaker: That’s like we say gwakila and in my mind I’m right away thinking about 
when I used to go up to River’s Inlet.  Yeah, gwagawa’i, like from Smith’s Inlet, 
River’s Inlet is gwagawe’, then Smith Inlet, further north.  You picture in your mind 
what we are saying about going north, you gwakila.  But in the river it’s different, 
you’re going down the river. 
         MN: So ‘gwenakw’ is a general term. So it can either mean ‘north region’, so the 
northern part of the coast, or down river. 
 
6.5 Proposed theory of downriver descent 
 
I am going to propose that the meanings as derived appear to indicate that the older form is 
“upriver/downriver” and that a coastal “north/south” orientation emerged later.  This hypothesis 
stems from a growing body of evidence indicating Kwakwaka’wakw populations descended from 
higher, upriver more mountainous locations as rivers flow from a glacier source towards 
downriver locations and ultimately outwards towards outlying coastal islands.   This would 

287 
 
 
support a premise of land occupation following the reduction of sea water levels.  Upriver 
territory would therefore have a longer history of occupation while downriver territory heading 
out towards the islands would have come later as sea-levels receded.   As Cannon (2000) 
observed while studying archeological core samples from clam middens on the British Columbia 
coast: 
 
…the next question is why the culture history of settlement in this region, including 
Namu, should correspond so closely to elevation above current sea level.  One 
explanation is that sea level has declined steadily over time as the result of 
postglacial isostatic rebound (Clague et al. 1982), making these locations available 
for settlement as they emerged from the sea (p. 73) 
 
 
Archeological data would suggest that right after deglaciation, 13,000-8,000 years ago, that 
water levels were high along the coast (Andrews & Retherford, 1978).  This was followed by a 
drop in water levels to a point actually lower than today.  The subsequent rise of the water after 
dropping may perhaps explain the numerous flood stories amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw. 
 

288 
 
 
In accordance we need to jointly consider linguistic analysis and cultural historical context.   
Boas (1948) Dictionary includes the words: 
 
(433)    gwaltłala                           “next down, lower (in rank)” (Boas 1948:291) 
(434)    gwigwa’enuxw                  “those at lower end of village” (Boas 1948:291) 
(435)    ‘nalanxi’                            “upper end of river, the best, most valuable” (Boas 1948:242) 
(436)    ‘nala’las                             “side up river, higher rank” (Boas 1948:242) 
(437)    ‘na’lagud                            “to get ahead going up river, in rank?” (Boas 1948:243) 
 
Rank is social standing.  Primogeniture was a highly valued aspect of the Kwakwaka’wakw 
traditional social system.  It remains so today.   The oldest members of the branches of a family 
are considered to be of higher rank than those lower.  In older days primogeniture outweighed 
even gender in certain situations.  The closer a person was to the original source of the family, 
be that through mythological historical narrative or through genealogy, the higher was one’s 
rank.   The words collected by Boas/Hunt referring to rank equate the concepts of “upriver” with 
“higher rank” and “downriver” with “lower rank”.  This analogy supports a theory of land 
population coming from upriver coastal regions and spreading downriver to occupy new territory 
as sea waters receded.  As populations grew over generations, younger branches of the 

289 
 
 
families would have left older upriver sites to pursue new sites of occupation downriver, 
eventually spreading far enough to leave the river estuaries and establish communities on 
adjacent islands.  
 
The origin story of the Dzawada’enuxw gives us an example.  Kawadilikala, the original 
ancestor of the Dzawada’enuxw tribe was a wolf.  He came from the north travelling down the 
Kingcome River with his brother (some stories include a sister and another brother) and their 
families.  Kawadilikala established his home in the Kingcome Valley.  Later on his brother Kwalili 
decided to find his own land.  He travelled on until he arrived at the river system next to 
Kingcome that empties into Wakeman Sound.  He made his home there and established the 
Haxwamis tribe.   In the Kingcome watershed Kawadilikala’s tribe grew.  As his tribe grew they 
established ‘namima or clans who occupied different places along the river.   It is only within 
more recent historical times that the Dzawada’enuxw ‘namima left their separate village sites 
and united at the location now called ‘Ukwanalis or Gwa’yi.   
 
According to Lagius (born mid-1800s) the Dzawada’enuxw informant for Edward S. Curtis and 
my great-grandfather’s brother, the ‘namima now called Wi’ukwama’i were originally called the 

290 
 
 
‘Ninalkinuxw, or “upriver people”.  They descended from Daband, who had been a mountain, 
and was one of Kawadilikala’s first adopted sons.  Also according to Lagius, one of the last 
‘naḿima of the Dzawada’enuxw to be established was the `Ka`ki`kilaka (those who always wish 
to kill) who descend from Kawadilikala’s adopted son Halxabo’i.  It is said that this clan built their 
houses near the mouth of the river. (Boas, 1902; Curtis 1915; Galois, 1994)  Figure 6.10 is a 
photo taken of Lagius by Curtis.

In Lagius’ narrative the oldest branches of the Dzawada’enuxw ‘naḿima occupy the upper 
portions of the river system and younger branches occupy lower portions.  It is hard to estimate 
the course of time that it would have taken for generations of the Dzawada’enuxw to fully 
occupy the Kingcome valley as it emerged from the sea but eventually the people came to settle 
at their current location, approximately 3km up from the mouth of the river. 
 
Another indication of early upriver occupation is contained within six Dzawada’enuxw narratives 
collected by George Hunt for Franz Boas for the 1902 publication of “Kwakiutl Texts”.  The first 
three of these narratives begin with the expression that the earliest of the Dzawada’enuxw were 
living on the upper course of the river Gwa’yi.  These narratives in particular speak of the 
experiences of Kawadilikala and his children.  The following three refer to the activities of the 
descendants of these early people.  These three stories are not prefaced with the expression 
that they were living on the ‘upper course of the river Gwa’yi’.  This tends to confirm that the 
upper courses of the river at the very least are symbolic of the idea of origin.

           “It is said that the first of the Dzawada’enuxw lived in a village on the course of the  
           river Gwa’yi.”   (Boas 1902, p. 36) 
 
  
The Gwawa’enuxw are a sister tribe to the Dzawada’enuxw.  Their name has been translated as 
the “downriver tribe” (RBCM,Duff fieldnotes, 1960 ).  It is possible that the name could have 
been derived as the “northern tribe” but there remains the question of “downriver from 
what/whom?” or alternatively “north from what/whom?”  The inference is that the Gwawa’enuxw 
tribe derive their name from a relationship to, either a historical “people” or aspect of geographic 
occupation.  Similarly, the Kwikwasuťinuxw, another sister tribe to the Dzawada’enuxw, have as 
their name the meaning “people from the opposite shore/other side” (RBCM,Duff fieldnotes, 
1960).   Again, the question can be asked, “opposite from whom, or where?”   The symbiotic 
notion of “to whom or where” is given greater clarity in the following description derived from 
Boas collection of Kwikwasuťinuxw stories.         
  
           Wa,   la’la’e   duxwatłali `Tsekam’yaxa  galasa  kwikwasika, laxa 
                Then `Tsekame’ was seen by the ancestors of the tribe of the other side, that is,  
 
           Dzawada’enuxwi’ gwo’ya 
                  the Dzawada’enuxw.                                                              (Boas 1902, p.192) 
 
 
The Dzawada’enuxw people are described as ‘the tribe of the other side’.  In positions of  

294 
 
 
adjacency and reciprocity the Kwikwasuťinuxw and the Dzawada’enuxw are joined by the very 
term kwikwasika that is used to name the Kwikwasuťinuxw.  The Dzawada’enuxw and the 
Haxwa’mis on the other hand through origin stories derive their names from the sound of the 
birds that occupy their valleys67.  One theory that supports the notion of original river based 
coastal occupation particular to the history of the ‘Musgamakw Dzawada’enuxw comes from an 
oral history quote from member Ernest Willie (1940-1999). 
 
“Understand the origin or the root word if you like of the Kwikwasu`tinuxw people from 
Kingcome, when the man crossed over at Anchorage Cove, over to the other side which 
is Bond Sound.  And his name was Gwalsalas.  Gwal – sa – las.  It’s an interesting name 
because what we anchor ourselves to as Kwi – kwa – su`t – inuxw  people, and we 
depict that on our totem which stands beside the church, `Tsekame’, but he was not the 
origin figure if you like of the Kwi – kwa – su`t – inuxw  people.   They went in a direction.  
The direction again is the kwisadza’e  of Anchorage Cove which is at the mouth of the 
Kingcome or the head of the Kingcome Inlet and it goes overland into the “far side” 
                                                 
67 Origin stories say the name of the Dzawada’enuxw comes from the sound of the robin which sings 
“dzawadzali!”; The name of the Haxwa’mis from the sound of the lark which sings “haxwala!”.   Duff gives 
the meaning of Dzawada’enuxw as “people of the place of eulochons”. (Fieldnotes 1960) as does Boas in 
his notes which Duff may have been referring to.

which you end up at Bond Sound.  This is where we as a people began again.  You have 
to remember that as a family again, they come out of Kawadilikala.  They do not 
originate out of nothing.  They do not originate from a different source altogether.  They 
are from Kawadilikala.  They only continued Kawadilikala’s direction, heading, if you 
want to use the compass points of today…he headed south, why his name was 
Gwalsalas.  If you were heading downriver, as of for instance, you will gwalisala.  Gwa– li

have this whole thing around being anchored together.  It was Gwalsalas who went over 
there with his family and began the storyline if you like of the Kwikwasu`tinuxw people.” 
(Ernest Willie, personal recording)  
 
The words which I have hyphenated in this transcript were pronounced emphatically 
morpheme by morpheme by Ernest Willie within his speech to emphasizes his own 
breakdown of the meanings of the names he was trying to explain. When he refers to 
Gwalsalas, the ancestor who left the Kingcome River system to establish a community at  

296 
 
 
Hada across from Anchorage Cove, he indicates that this man’s name literally means 
“going downriver”.  He also indicates that the name of the Kwikwasu`tinuxw people is 
derived from the act of occupying land “on the other side” of Bond Sound geographically 
across from Kingcome Inlet.  These were his theories of historical movement and land 
occupation based on oral history and his own linguistic analysis of names.  The following 
are a list of words derived from the stem kwis- “far in space or time” (Boas, 1948, p. 343) 
recorded by Boas. 
 
(438)     Kwikwasuťinuxw                  “people of the far side” (Boas 1948:344) 
(439)     kwisadza’e                           “far side of a flat thing” (Boas 1947:228) 
(440)     kwisakan’we’                       “to be on far side” (Boas 1947:228) 
(441)     kwis-                                     “direction towards there” (Boas 1947:227) 
Or its opposite: 
(442)     gwas-                                   “direction towards here” (Boas 1947:227) 
                                                          “this side” (Boas 1931:175) 
 
The stem kwis- “direction towards there” is contrasted with gwas- meaning “direction towards 
here”.  These stems together give an account of spatial placement in relationship to a subject.  
In the case of Willie’s narrative it is the historical movement outwards “towards the other side” of 

297 
 
 
Hada and Bond Sound away from the point of origin within the Kingcome Valley which gives the 
Kwikwasuťinuxw people their name.    He is explicit in saying that the Kwikwasuťinuxw people 
are also descendants of the Dzawada’enuxw ancestor, the wolf Kawadilikala.   In this regard in 
certain Kwikwasuťinuxw origin stories the wife of `Tsekame’ is transformed from a wolf and in a 
story collected by Franz Boas the home village of the Gwawa’enuxw, Hegams is formed by 
ancestors who remove their wolf skins and transform them into land (Boas, 1935).  In addition, 
in George Hunt’s handwritten notes he identifies Kumugaxto’i as the name of Kawadilikala.  In 
“Kwakiutl Texts, Second Series”, Kawadilikala is given the name Kumugaxto’i along with the 
great ghost dance, the masdika (madam) dance, the dog mask (‘walasaxa ‘wasamł) and many 
wolf masks (‘walasaxa długwala).  The name Kumugaxto’i is used as a `naḿima or clan name 
of the Gwawa’enuxw68.  The theme of the wolf as an aspect of origin runs through all four tribal 
histories of the ‘Musgamakw Dzawada’enuxw.  This wolf theme parallels the historical 
movement of land population in the Kingcome Valley outwards into the Broughton archipelago 
as mapped out in Figure 6.11.

6.6 Expanding ‘nal-[‘nal-] and gwa- to the British Columbia coastal axis 
 
The river based geographic meaning of ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver” and gwa- “downriver” is consistent.  
There are no discrepencies.  However, on the coastal axis while generally ‘nal-[‘nal-] can be 
taken to mean “south” and gwa- “north” there are notable inconsistencies.  For instance gwitala 
is translated as “people from the north” by Grubb (1977:171) and gwitalabidu’ is a word 
translated by Boas (1948:295) as meaning “little northerners”.  Boas also lists gwitalaḱala as 
meaning the “Tsimshian language”.  The Tsimshian live north of the Kwakwaka’wakw.    
“However, he also lists gwi`tala as referring to the West Coast (Nuu-chah-nulth) language and 
gwikwatala as a word for the West Coast (Nuu-chah-nulth) people in general.  The Nuu-chah-
nulth people live south-west  of the Kwakwaka’wakw.   Grubb (1977) lists gwigweta as a 
Kwak’wala word that refers to the Coast Salish who live south of the Kwakwaka’wakw.  One 
possibility for the variance in interpretation of these terms might be the stem gwił- (Boas 
1948:295) which means “to scatter, to spread”.   If we take into consideration the cultural 
historical context of the upriver/downriver dichotomy then the population dispersal in a down-
river direction is also applied to the extension of population outwards to the north, south and 
west.  This would also be consistent with origin stories which detail how during the great floods 

300 
 
 
various populations broke away and were dispersed from the Kwakwaka’wakw coastal center 
outwards both to the north and to the west. 
 
(443)    gwiłtsi’stala                      “scattering things, objects around” (www.firstvoices.com) 
(444)    gwiłt`sand                        “take something apart” (www.firstvoices.com) 
(445)    gwił’id                              “separate (like a couple) or scatter things around, to” 
                                                     (www.firstvoices.com) 
 
 
The broadening of the interpretation and application of the gwa- stem to encompass “a 
movement away from the centre” is also evident in the following words: 
 
(446)    gwa`ku`taxdłi’                    “lower side of a tree on a river bank” (Boas 1948:292) 
(447)    gwa’a`pełaxs                      “second thwart, behind first man in canoe” (Boas 1948:292) 
(448)    gwa`kudaxtłalisa `tłisala     “afternoon” (Boas 1948:292)  
 
Another example of the mapping of the core concept of ‘nal-[‘nal-] / gwa- upriver/downriver onto 
the coastal axis is contained within the words of a song for a Kwagu’ł chief named Nakaṕankam 

301 
 
 
who initiated a war against the Saanich (Coast Salish) people in order to avenge the deaths of 
his sister and his niece in the latter half of the 19th Century.   The song goes: 
 
 
          I began at the upper end of the tribes.  
         Serves them right! Serves them right! 
          I came downstream setting fire to the tribes everywhere with my firebringer. 
          Serves them right! Serves them right! 
          My name, just my name, killed them, I the great mover of the world. 
          Serves them right! Serves them right!  (Boas 1921, p.1380-81) 
 
 
The actual war waged by Nakaṕankam was fought in a north to south direction; Nakaṕankam 
being based in on the northern part of Vancouver Island and the Saanich people situated on the 
southern portion.  The poetry of the song commemorating this war describes the location of the 
Kwagu’ł as “up” and their movement, as heading “downstream”. This use of metaphor in poetic 
language supports the hypothesis that the concept of upriver/downriver was the original source 
from which a broader coastal axis of “north/south” was derived as populations expanded.  This 

302 
 
 
is also supported by the inconsistency of the north/south meanings rendering them a less stable 
application than that of the upriver/downriver axis.   A contemporary speaker when asked about 
the use of the ‘nal-[‘nal-] and gwa- stems in an island based context like Gwayasdams on 
Gilford Island said the terms were still applicable.  This indicates that the terminologies from   
river based communities was retained despite changes in geography. 
 
6.7 Radial extension of meanings associated with ‘nal-[‘nal-] 
We have discussed previously that atł- can be associated with the general meaning of “behind” 
and that ťłas-,at least in the past, was associated with the general meaning of “in front”.   Of the 
four stems associated with geographic region or direction ‘nal-[‘nal-] appears to have the widest 
extension of applied meanings.  While gwa- seems to refer primarily to “downriver”, a 
generalized coastal “north”, and of “lower rank”,’nal-[‘nal-] is given the additional meanings of 
“light”, “sky”, “dawn” and “world” in addition to “upriver” and “south”.   
  
(449)    ‘na- “light, sky, world, dawn, south“ (Boas 1931:165).   
(450)    ‘nala – “up river, south, world; before consonants ‘nal- “ (Boas 1947:228) 

303 
 
 
These extensions are key imperatives to understanding a Kwakwaka’wakw perspective of the 
universe more so than any other of the four major roots expressing region or direction. ‘na- is a 
reduction of the root ‘nal-[‘nal]- to the stem ‘na-.  It includes the concepts “light”, “sky”, “world” 
and “dawn”.  If we take into consideration the earlier discussion of cultural context then we can 
see how these concepts might map to an “upriver” epistemology and promote the application of 
certain metaphorical analogy.  If we consider the root ‘na- in the Figure 6.8 it contains within it 
the concepts “light, sky, world, dawn and south” 
 
 
                          Figure  6.12: Radial diagram of ‘na- stem  
 
'na- "day, light,

dawn, south" 
 
'nal- "upriver,

304 
 
 
(451)    ‘nala                              “day” (Boas 1948:241) 
(452)    ‘nax’id                           “it gets daylight” (Boas 1948:241) 
(453)    nagala                           “light appears” (Boas 1948:241) 
(454)    nagila                            “to live, act, until dawn” (Boas 1948:241) 
(455)    ‘nakwała                       “light” (Boas 1948:242) 
(456)    ‘nak’walis                      “light in world, on beach” (Boas 1948:242) 
 
‘nala while meaning “day” can also mean the “world” as in the following phrase: 
 
(457)    ‘na’istłuxda ‘nalax          “daytime will be this world” (Boas 1948:241) 
 
 
In the following phrase the stem ‘nala is used to mean both “best” and “world” 
 
 
(458)   …yu’manuxw ‘nalanxa ha’ma laxa i`ka’dzilisa ‘nala  (Boas 1902:178) 
                            This is our           best        food     in the    upper          world 
 
      
If we take these varied meanings and place them within a broader context we begin to see how 
the association between meanings starts to unfold as a particular Kwakwaka’wakw worldview 
where the associations make sense.  The beginning of a day (‘nala) is associated with ‘the 

305 
 
 
breaking of dawn (‘na’nakwala) and the emergence of light (‘nakwała).  If we apply the metaphor 
of a “day” as equivalent to “all of time” we get: 
 
                             the emergence of light = the beginning of time.  
 
 We can see this metaphor in action with the following narrative told by my grandfather Charlie 
Willie to the anthropologist Ronald Rohner69: 
 
         Qawadeilakala with his four children and his younger brother Koleili  lived before 
there was light on the earth.  They heard the voice of God who said that they were 
to go and find a place which they could claim as their own.  The voice promised 
them the cloak of a wolf for ease of transportation [i.e. transformed them into 
wolves].  The two brothers and four children came first to Kingcome.  The older 
brother claimed lalaq, a site up Kingcome River as his own.  Koleili did not want to 
share the same site as his brother, so he moved on to look for his 
         own place.  He travelled to lax’oh “clear-water” and then to Wakeman 
River…(Rohner1970, p. 86)

It is the events “at the beginning of time” that set the standard for the following generations to 
mimic and replicate within their ceremonies.  It is also set within an earlier historical time frame 
that the original tribal ‘naḿima began their gradual descent “downriver” from their “upriver” 
locations.  Literally, within a Kwakwaka’wakw mindset the “day” and the “world” are equivalent in 
time and space as “where events occur”.  Events begin with the emergence of light in the day 
and in the world.  Up river is associated with the oldest and the best locations both 
geographically and historically.  In this conceptualization time is compressed or expanded to 
encompass “a day” or “all time”.  “Upriver” is associated with the most distant past in time and 
the most valuable and ancient of land occupation.  Because the Kwakwaka’wakw value 
primogeniture and the idea of the origin/original these associations make sense in Kwak’wala 
while they appear disparate in English.  Another example of this way of thinking can be found in 
the name of the oldest son of `Tsekame’, the founding ancestor of the Kwikwasu’tinuxw Tribe.

         Head-Winter-Dancer said at once to his wife, “His name shall be Upper-End”. 
 
                                                                                                (Boas 1908, p. 179-180) 
  
The significance of the name ‘Nalbe’ lies in the geography of the lands occupied by the 
Kwikwasuťinuxw tribe that `Tsekame’ founded.  The Kwikwasuťinuxw occupy lands in the 
Broughton Archipelago and their main village is on Gilford Island.  The name ‘Nalbe’ translates 
as “upper end” (Boas 1908) or ‘those at the upper end of the river” (Boas 1966).  The naming of 
`Tsekame’s oldest son is significant in two ways.  First it draws together the geographic location 
of up-river with the symbolic association of the oldest and the best.  The second issue of 
significance is that the geographic demography where this story takes place and the evolution of 
the ancestral lands of the Kwikwasu’tinuxw is island or inlet based not river based.   ‘Nalbe’ 
builds his house at Wato, near Xakwikan in Thompson Sound, eastward from the home location 
of his parents at ‘Mitap.  I believe the significance of his name is not so much a direct reference 
to an up-river location but the application of an eastern point that runs parallel to the 
upriver/downriver axis on the broadened geography of the Kwikwasuťinuxw movement 

308 
 
 
outwards into the Broughton archipelago.  This geographic significance is joined to the social 
significance of being the oldest.  This example shows how the original association of 
upriver/downriver is carried outwards even into a geographic that is no longer situated on the 
axis of upriver/downriver but inlets and islands.   
 
The following words may represent the presence of a linguistic phonaestheme pattern. 
According to Bauer (2004) a phonaestheme is: 
 
        …a sequence of sounds which, while it often correlates with a particular meaning, 
cannot be analysed as a morph in a word because morphs lead to an exhaustive 
analysis of the word but phonaesthemes do not.  The gl- in words like gleam, 
glimmer, glitter is often cited as a phoanestheme whose meaning can be glossed 
as ‘having to do with light’. (p. 84) 
  
‘na-  may express a very generalized meaning that reflects the idea of “origin” with that 
of ‘na- “day, light, world and ‘nal- “up river, the best, higher rank”.  At the very least it 

309 
 
 
represents a type of radial category that infers a connection between meanings 
connected to a minimal remnant of linguistic phonological form. 
 
(459)    ‘nam                           “one” (Boas 1948:239) 
(460)    ‘naḿima’                     “clan, of one kind” pl. ‘nał’namima    “family group supposed to be

                                                 maternal line, also including adopted members” (Boas 1948:240)

And also perhaps by extension:

In a way the stem ‘na- has similar connotation as the stem ga- discussed in chapter 3.  Both 
refer back to ideas of temporal/historical origin; ga- in spatial relationship to the self as the point 
of origin with references to historical origins, and ‘na- more directly related to the spatial location 
of the village with spatial extension into the broader context of geography and referential 
relationship to ideas around origin and primogeniture within which these village sites are 
contextualized. 
 
6.8  Iḱi  “above” and ba’ni  “below” 
Boas (1848) Dictionary defines iḱ- as “above, up”.  It tends to denote a more generalized notion 
of spatial position with specific extension into the geographic zone of the sky, or heavens 
through words like iḱadza’lis “upper world” (pp.23), iḱi “sky or above, the” (www.firstvoices.com).  
In the following line from the contemporary hymn “Abide with Me” the translation refers to the 
English word for “heaven”: 
 
 

311 
 
 
         Dukwalala xan tłaxs ga’yu’yola’os 
            Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes 
 
         `Kwaxsłala xa ṕadaka gaxan, 
              Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies 
 
              Ka’s ťsamała’osan laxa Iḱi 
              Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee 
 
          Dałaxse’am gaxan ḱi’s bowan. 
             In life, in death, O Lord abide with me. Amen 
 
          (Kwak’wala Hymnal,Anglican Diocese of British Columbia, p.6) 
 
 
Boas (1948) Dictionary defines the stem ba’n-  and words ba’nała and ba’n i’ as “underneath, 
below”.  Again these are general spatial orientations.  Geographically zoned extensions include 
words such as ba’nagawi’ “farthest underneath, the ghost country”. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
           
 
                                     Figure 6.13  Up in the sky and beneath the earth 
 
 
iḱi – “above, the sky zone, the heavens, realm of those who fly 
Ba’ni- “below, underground, realm of the ghosts 
gukw –“house” 

312 
 
 
In general the word iḱi refers to the sky region and the word ba’ni refers to the underworld.   
Birds and other beings that possess the capability of flight occupy the sky region, while ghosts 
are considered to occupy the land beneath the earth. 
 
(470)    iḱi                              “sky, or above the” (www.firstvoices.com) 
(471)    ba’ni                          “below, down there, underneath (www.firstvoices.com) 
 
The following lists of words are extensions off the stems iḱi- and ba’ni- 
 
(472)    iḱala                          “something high” (Boas 1948:23) 
(473)    iḱabala                      “slanting rafters of house” (Boas 1948:23) 
(474)    iḱadze’lis                   “upper world” (Boas 1848:24) 
(475)    iḱagamała                 “to look up” (Boas 1948:24) 
 
The root iḱ-  can be applied more generally than just the arena of geography or architecture as 
in the following examples: 
 

313 
 
 
(476)    iḱetłala                       “just above the other” (Boas 1948:24) 
(477)    iḱodaxste’                  “upper lip” (Boas 1948:24) 
(478)    iḱoł`tsand                   “to fill more than half” (Boas 1948:24) 
 
An interesting relationship appears with the phonologically related stem ik- meaning “something 
good”. 
 
(479)    a’ikas                          “fine weather” (Boas 1948:23) 
(480)    ikadzala                      “sky is clear” (Boas 1948:23) 
(481)    ika                              “to overcome, to win [as in a game] (Boas 1948:23) 
(482)    ixḱasala                      “to be happy” (Boas 1948:24) 
(483)    ixstuḱwan                   “bright colored” (Boas 1948:24) 
(484)    ixťsam                        “abalone” (Boas 1948:24) 
 
The following words correspond to concepts of “below”: 
 
(485)    ban- (-ała, -i’)               “underneath, below” (Boas 1948:111) 

314 
 
 
(486)    ba’nagawe’                  “farthest underneath: the ghost country” (Boas 1948:111) 
(487)    ba’nga’la                      “low sided (box, canoe, vessel)” (Boas 1948:111) 
(488)    ba’nḱudaxste’               “lower lip” (Boas 1948:111) 
(489)    ba’nḱułt`si                     “lower than half way mark” (Boas 1948:112) 
 
In a contemporary sense the understanding of “below ground” and “in the sky” are given 
expression in the disciplines of archeology, astronomy and astrology.  They are considered to 
be associated, but somehow separate from geography.  In the cultural Kwakwaka’wakw 
conceptualization of the land they are more intimately associated.  While “below ground” and “in 
the sky” remain relatively beyond the physical ability to traverse most of the origin stories of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw conflate the appearance of an ancestor who comes from “below ground” or “in 
the sky” to a certain geographic place within Kwakwaka’wakw territory in order to establish a 
community.   In the case of the Dzawada’enuxw, the original ancestor Kawadilikala comes from 
the north-east and travels south along the Kingcome River meeting new tribesmen who found 
the Dzawada’enuxw ‘naḿima (clans).  Lawagila, the raven, who meets Kawadilikala while 
walking the beach, comes out of the sky and forms the Lilawagila ‘naḿima.  Daband, who 
comes out of a rock, but was originally a mountain forms the ‘Wa’ukwama’i ‘naḿima.  `Kixťlala 

315 
 
 
is the sun that comes out of the sky and forms the Gigagama’i ‘naḿima. Only Halxabo’i, who 
forms the `Kaḱila’ka ‘naḿima, meets Kawadilikala while he is already in his human form. 
 
         The first man of the Tsawatenok70 was Káwaṭilikálla, but before he was a man he 
was a wolf and his wife was a wolf.  They lived on the upper course of the 
Kingcome River [at the head of Kingcome Inlet].  One day a heavy rain was 
falling and he said; “I do not see why we should remain animals.  We had better 
leave off these skins and use them only in dancing.  Why should we wander 
about and have no home?  If we had a house to live in when it rains, it would be 
well.”…His first son was Tláwitsá, his second Kulili and his third Ná’nuwalaq 
[“miracles”]. Tláwitsā and his father were sad because they had no companions, 
and one day as they sat outside the house talking about it, they heard a crying 
sound in a large rock.  They arose hurriedly and broke it open, and revealed a

youth.  “Welcome!” said the old man.  “I am glad to see you.  We want someone 
to come and live with us.” “That is why I have come,” said the youth. “I heard your 
wish and decided to come and be a man with you.  I am Ṭapǔnt [“helper”].  Now 
that I have come, you may have all my names.  My name is Stone, my name is 
Mountain, my name is Big Mountain, my name is Increasing Mountain.”  He 
repeated many other names of this kind, and concluded, “All these you may have 
and use when you need them. “His descendants formed the gens which was 
formally called Ninǔlḳinuh [“people of the head of the river”], but which now is 
called Wioqǔmi [“irresistible”]. 
         Again, Káwaṭilikálla saw a Raven strutting along the beach.  All he could think of 
was how to get tribesmen.  He said to the Raven: “I wish you were a man so that 
you could come and be my tribesman.”  The Raven threw back his feather dress 
and replied: “What am I, after all?  You see I am a man when I wish to be.”  Said 
Káwaṭilikálla, “Well, you had better put that feather coat away.  Come and be a 
man, and use this feather dress only when we dance.  That is what I have done.”  
This the Raven agreed to do.  “Tell me your name,” said Káwaṭilikálla.  And the 
Raven replied: “My name is Lǔwágyila, and my name is Kyakyamǔtlalasǔ [“folded 

317 
 
 
up”] “Well, then,” said Káwaṭilikálla, “you shall be the rival chief of my son 
Tláwitsā, and your children shall be the rivals of the Kékaṭilikálla  [abbreviated 
form of Kékawaṭilikálla, the plural of Káwaṭilikálla].”  So the Raven man was the 
first of the gens Lίlǔwagyila [plural of Lǔwágyila].  On another day Káwaṭilikálla 
and the others heard thunder.  He said, “It is a strange time of year for thunder!  
Perhaps, he too wants to be a man with us.”  Now this noise was not caused by 
the thunderbird but by the Sun, who had borrowed the wings of kolus, a great 
bird.  Leaving his wings in the mountains he came down in the form of a man, 
and Káwaṭilikálla was glad to have another tribesman.  Said the Sun; “You may 
have my names.  I have brought many with me.  My names are Kéhtlala [‘much 
wood in the fire’], Kéhtlalatsi [‘much wood in the big fire’] – and he named many 
others having to do with fire.  He built a house and above the smoke-hole he 
made a wooden chimney so that when a great fire was burning the flames shot 
up to the sky.  This house he called Kyίlúpstala.  [a chimney is still added to the 
house when the Gyίgyίkǔmi (“chiefs”) gens give a feast or a potlatch.] This gens 
formerly was called Kékǔhtlala [plural of the founder’s name]. 
 

318 
 
 
         One day all the people embarked on their canoes and descended the river to see 
what was at its mouth.  On the way they found a man living alone with his mother.  
His name was Hálhapui [“looking out from under a shadow”, such as the rim of a 
hat might cast].  He had much to tell them, how he had been captured by the 
wolves and had received from them the living water and the magic death-dealer.  
After listening to his story Káwaṭilikálla took Hálhapui and his mother and 
proceeded to the mouth of the river, where the people built houses.  Hálhapui 
founded the gens Gyágyikyilagya [“those who always wish to kill”].  (Curtis 1915, 
p. 132-134) 
 
The locations of “below ground” and “from above “ are significant in that while physical provision 
comes from the sea and forest regions through both plant life and animals, spiritual provision is 
acquired from “below ground” or “from above”.  In the case of Daband, he emerges from stone 
and he embodies the mountains.  In later narratives he is associated with the ability to capture 
mountain goats; a gift acquired through entering a hole in the mountainside.  In the case of 
‘Kixa`tłala, he emerges from the sky in the form of a bird and is associated with the sun and with 
fire. In a later historical time period an ancestor of the Dzawada’enuxw is married to a man 

319 
 
 
named Sanťłe’ (Sunbeam) who takes her up into the sky world where she is given a house 
`Kiḱastłan whose house-front is painted with an image of the sun and moon.   She returns from 
the sky realm pregnant and with many gifts which are manifest on earth. 
 
         …Then Sanťłe’ spoke, and said, “O mistress, don’t feel badly, for I will let you go 
home.  If you want it, only say, ‘I want a house to come,’ and my father’s large 
house will be at once at the place where you want it to be; and if you want 
anything, you have only to call my name, for I shall be near you all the time.” Thus 
spoke Sanťłe’ to his wife. Then Food-Giver spoke to her husband and said, “Thank 
you master, that you do not want to keep me and my younger sisters in this upper-
world.”  Thus spoke Food-Giver to her husband. Then Sanťłe’ called Brain-eating-
Woman and said, “Go and borrow the long rope of The-One-Who-Climbs-down, 
that is the spider.”  Brain-eating-Woman went at once, it was not long before Brain-
eating-Woman came, carrying on her arm the long rope of The-One-Who-Climbs-
down.  She gave it to Sanťłe’, who took it and called the four women. 
         Then Sanťłe’ said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Stand close together.”  Then he 
wrapped his large dressed-skin blanket around the four sisters, and tied one end of 

320 
 
 
the long rope to the four women. After he had tied them, he opened the door of the 
upper world and put his wife and her younger sisters, bundled together through it. 
         It did not take them long before they reached this (our) lower world.  Food-Giver 
did not know who untied them.  Then she saw our world here.  Food-Giver just 
arose and sat down and gave birth to a child. (Boas 1902, p. 52-53)   
 
Food-Giver (Hamdzidi) is also gifted with names which refer to light and to abalone which is 
equated with light.  These names have been passed down to contemporary generation today 
and have spread amongst other Kwakwaka’wakw tribes through marriage.   In another 
Dzawada’enuxw story, `Kumukwa,  who is also named Copper-Maker (`Tłakwagila) dwells 
under the sea and is an intermediary between mankind and the wealth of the ocean realm.  In 
order to meet him Wealthy (`Kumxḱomgila), the chief of the ‘namima Lilawagila (Heaven-
Makers) is pulled underwater in a supernatural canoe prepared by his wife.  She turns out to be 
the daughter of Copper-Maker and after descending beneath the sea they come upon her 
father’s village where he is given many gifts.   
 
 …Then the pretty woman got ready.  She took the stout rope and tied one end of 
it to the bow of the canoe, and then she pulled it tight and tied (the other end) to 

321 
 
 
the stern of the large self-paddling canoe; then she took eight dressed skins and 
threw them over the stout rope, and she pegged them with yew-wood pegs at the 
edges of the sides (gunwales) of the large canoe.  Now she had made a house of 
the canoe, that it should not let in water. Now she had finished her work.  Then 
the tide [of the sea] was going out.  It was very low tide.  Then the pretty woman 
called her son and her husband and the four attendants, and she said, ”Come. let 
us start. Only take care!  You must all help and paddle, that we go fast when we 
pass through the door of the underworld.” Then they went into the canoe, and all 
the attendants paddled, and the pretty woman steered the canoe.  Then they 
went into the cave, and the attendants saw that the sea-water ran through it; and 
they saw the bones of men, many of them, on each side of the channel.  These 
are the bones of all who are drowned all around our world.  Then the large self-
paddling canoe went down with the tide. 
         As soon as they passed through (the cave), Wealthy saw many houses.  
Then he heard (people) at the houses shouting, and saying, “O Copper-Maker!  
Copper-making-Woman is coming in sight here.”  Then for the first time Wealthy 
learned the name of his wife. (Boas 1902, p. 79-80) 

322 
 
 
Wealthy (`Kumxḱomgila), is gifted with his father-in-law’s house and his names which he returns 
to earth with.  The `tłakwa  “copper”  is still considered to be the highest symbol of wealth 
amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw.  It came to Wealthy (`Kumxḱomgila), from beneath the sea.

The story excerpts I have presented are only a few of many that illustrate the relationship of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw to the geographical domains of “below ground” and “from above” in ways that 
are less physically tangible than the geographic zones of “the sea”, “the woods”, “up-river” and 
“down-river” and yet are just as significant within the Kwakwaka’wakw imagination and ultimate 
geographic conceptualization. The zones are inter-related because the regions of “below 
ground” and “from above” are the source domains of spiritual wealth which are translated into 
the ability to acquire physical wealth in the earthly domains of the forest and the sea.  This 
connection exists primarily in the mind and in the imagination of the Kwakwaka’wakw as the 
physical ability to traverse these domains was limited to climbing up into the mountains and the 
use of existing caves underground.  Yet, I highlight its significance as a conceptual interface of 
geographic experience inter-related to actual physical experience in the land. 
 
 
6.9 Spatial and temporal expansion and contraction in narrative 
 
Western European standards of geography tend to approach the concept of land under the 
notion of distribution.  Under measurement conditions a landscape is given character through 
height and distance.  For example; a river runs so many kilometres in a northwest direction; a 

324 
 
 
mountain can be surveyed to reach 3000ft in height.  By mapping the formal characteristics of 
geography we are able to create maps that take a landscape beyond our ability to humanly 
observe in a single setting and collapse that observation down into an image that we are able to 
expand and contract.  However, as much as the landscape exists as a physical presence in the 
world and as much as the map exists as a physical referent to the landscape it is the analogical 
conceptual process of contraction and expansion that creates an understanding of the 
landscape in the mind by the use of the map.  I am using this example to highlight the cognitive 
process required to generate an image in the mind that is translated into meaning; a process of 
analogy.  In this case the map is a contracted analogical derivative of the land in real space 
which helps us formulate an impression of the land in our minds which we cannot see under 
ordinary biological single perspective observation.  I am using this example because the 
cognitive process of expansion and contraction is an analogical process which is prevalent in 
the Kwak’wala language and reveals itself in Kwakwaka’wakw culture in particular ways.  
  
The particularities of analogy exemplified by expansion and contraction in Kwak’wala reveal 
some of the cognitive processes in place for a Kwakwaka’wakw epistemology or world-view.  It 
begins with our mental conception of our physical selves ‘in the world’ we inhabit.  In this regard,

to a limited extent, we have discussed in this chapter the concept of ťłas- “sea region, facing the 
water” and atł- “forest region, behind” as they relate to the expansion of the independent body to 
the home, the village, and the world (geography).  In addition we have discussed the further 
defined notion of locations of the body within the village, and of the village in the world 
(geography) with historicity, ideas of origin and by extension, primogeniture and rank. 
 
The Kwakwaka’wakw concept of geographic space is not limited to just relationships of 
geographic forms to one another but is imbued with symbolism and extended meaning through 
metaphor, what I have referred to previously as ‘the analogy of expansion and contraction’.  
Analogical expansion and contraction is not exclusive to Kwak’wala.  In the English language, 
the notion of expansion and contraction of time is also evident.  For example, in poetry, where 
the idea of a lifetime is measured metaphorically in the physical character of the passing of a 
year; winter is considered the time of old age and spring the time of youth or in the following 
example by Dylan Thomas, where the temporal length of a human lifespan at approximately 85 
years can be collapsed metaphorically into the temporal span of a single year or a single day.  
 
Do not go gentle into that good night, 
Old age should rage and burn at close of day; 

326 
 
 
Rage, rage, against the dying of the light. 
(Dylan Thomas, 1951) 
 
While both English and Kwak’wala exhibit the concept of analogical spatial and temporal 
expansion and contraction.  What I want to point out here are the particularities of analogical 
expansion and contraction that relate to the land.    Examples we have reviewed are the 
temporal expansion of a ‘day’ into ‘all time’ and the spatial expansion of down-river / up-river to 
the coastal north and south through historical population movement.  An apparent crossover of 
the two is the analogy of up-river with greater historical depth.  The concept of temporal and 
spatial expansion and contraction is also evident literally in Kwakwaka’wakw mythological 
histories.  In many stories the theme of collapsed and expanded time is made literal, as well as 
the themes of collapsed and expanded spaces.   Consider the following excerpts: 
 
When `Tsekame’ (Head-Winter-Dancer), the original ancestor of the Kwikwasu`tinuxw has sons 
each of them grow up to be men in the space of months rather than years.  These events are 
conflations of time (months rather than years) and space (growth from small to large).  The 
following describes the growth of `Tsekame’s third son. 
 

327 
 
 
          `Tsekame’  - Head-Winter-Dancer’s sons 
         Then Winter-Dance-Woman was with child again, and after four months she gave 
birth to a boy.  Head-Winter-Dancer said at once to his wife, “O Mistress, now his 
name shall be Cannibal.”  Thus said Head-Winter-Dancer to his wife.  Now Head-
Winter-Dancer always washed his son in cold water, and when Cannibal was four 
months old he was a full grown man. (Boas 1902, p.180-181) 
 
 
In this second example, ‘Kala’min’, an ancestor of the Dzawada’enuxw is given a supernatural 
dog by Tawixa’xta’, a supernatural man who is really a mountain goat.  The dog has 
supernatural ability to successfully hunt mountain goat.  Tawixa’xta’ also gives ‘Kala’min’ his 
name. 
 
         ‘Kala’min’s dog 
 
         …But he did not walk long [on the ground] then he arrived in front of a large 
mountain.  Then he saw forty mountain-goats eating the grass of the mountain.  At 
once, he who had now the name Tawixa’xta’ took off his red cedar-bark and took 
out his small dog from the cross-piece in the neck part of his head-ring of red 

328 
 
 
cedar-bark.  As soon as he put it on the ground, it became a large dog.  At once it 
turned its face towards the place where the forty mountain-goats were, and ran. 
         When Tawixa’xta’ saw the dog, it was as though he threw something, therefore all 
the forty mountain-goats were at once dead.  But it was not long before the dog 
came back to the place where the master of the dog was standing.  The 
Tawixa’xta’ took it at once in his arms, and spoke to it kindly.  Then he pressed it.  
The dog at once became small again, the size of a humming-bird.  Then he put it 
into the cross-piece in the neck part of his red cedar bark.  Then he finished. (Boas 
1902, p. 39-40) 
 
In the third example, a story from the `Namgis people, a boy has a supernatural experience 
where time is expanded.  He becomes upset with his parents and leaves the village.  Wanting to 
commit suicide he throws himself into the river but unsuccessful he continues on and arrives at 
a steep rock whereupon he starts to climb a mountain: 
 
         He went on and soon saw a mountain top ahead which shone like a light.  It was 
the Nawalakwa rock, where there was a constant rain of rock crystal.  He picked 

329 
 
 
up four pieces the length of a finger and stuck them in his hair in a row from the 
front to the back.  He climbed up the mountain and became completely covered 
in rock crystal, he had acquired the ability to fly.  Thereupon he flew all over the 
world.  He thought that he was absent for four days, but it was four years.  At last 
he flew back to his home.  His relatives happened to be in Ni’nalgas and were 
working on the side of the lake by torch light when he appeared in the shape of a 
snow-white eagle and caused rock-crystal to rain down. (Boas 2002:336) 
 
In a story relating the acquisition of the hamaťsa ceremonial, objects thrown by boys 
fleeing from the cannibal Baxwbakwalanuxwsiwe, expand to block his pursuit.  A comb 
becomes a thicket of brush, a stone becomes a mountain, hair oil becomes a large pond 
and a stick becomes a tree: 
 
         Then (the eldest one) threw the comb backward.  Immeadiately there was a 
thicket of crabapples[?].  Cannibal-at-North-End-of-World was tangled up in it.  
Then the brothers crossed the mountain, and again they heard him coming near 
behind.  Then his brothers ran along level ground, when Cannibal-at-North-End-

330 
 
 
of-World approached again.  Then the eldest one threw the stone backwards, 
and it at once became a mountain. (Boas, 1910, pp. 391-393) 
 
Each of these stories provides examples where either time or space has the ability to expand or 
collapse.  A supernatural child is born within four months instead of nine.  This same child grows 
into an adult within four months.   A supernatural dog can grow and shrink on command.  A boy 
is gone for what he experiences as days but upon his return is told it has been years.   A stone 
becomes a mountain.  For the Kwakwaka’wakw the concept of analogical expansion and 
contraction of time and space is a common theme in narrative.   Through these imaginative 
expressions it is possible to see how the concept of empathetic expansion of structural 
characteristics is repeated throughout Kwakwaka’wakw conceptualization.  This acts as both 
primer and complement to concepts of spatial expansion and contraction between the 
relationships of the body, the house, the village, and ultimately the landscape. 
 
6.10  Summary 
Specific to this thesis is the proposal that it is the body within a specific environment that 
contributes to particular cultural understandings.  Lakoff and Johnson (1999) posit that the most 

331 
 
 
familiar human experience is that of the body and that metaphorical extensions are derivations 
of this bodily experience.  These theories have tremendous consequences for how the domains 
of space and time are conceptualized.  Boas (1935) was able to accurately identify the polarities 
of atł- “landwards” / `tłas- “seawards”  and gwa- “upriver” / ‘nal-[‘nal-] “downriver" as major 
orientations within the Kwakwaka’wakw conceptualization of geographic space.   It is the 
body=house marked by the u-[a’w-] stem that is situated as the central spatial locator off of 
which the other four directions are derived in order to conceptualize the landscape.   The 
premise is that the body/house in space is oriented to face the water with the back to the forest.  
This is the primary orientation of the Kwakwaka’wakw as expressed in the Kwak’wala language. 
This primary orientation is then further delineated by the secondary orientation of “upriver” and 
“downriver”.  These orientations have culturally relevant association with histories and social 
standings.   Geographic terminology in Kwak’wala is determined by the landscape of its origin 
and by extension reflects cultural expression.  By practical application houses (and the body) 
are oriented towards the sea and all physical forays into the world are defined by the movement 
into the zone of the sea or that of the land. Transformative spiritual forays into the world are 
defined by imaginative movement into the sky or below ground.   Historical movement, the 
movement through time, expands the concept of upriver / downriver from simply geographic to 

332 
 
 
temporal.  It operates under the premise of the conflation of space with time.  Time and space 
are marked by analogical contraction and expansion and Kwakwaka’wakw geography must be 
considered under this primary premise or the engagement remains merely topical.  These ideas 
are expressed in linguistic word based analysis and narrative. By considering how the linguistic 
forms manifest in stories we are able to begin to comprehend a different and particular way of 
negotiating one’s place in the world, or one’s geography that is equally defined in the mind by 
the physical phenomenon (or form) of the landscape itself as well as language and cultural 
practice (the meaning or comprehension of that form).

         Dream of Gwagwadaxala 
 
         I dreamed that I had been taken by a man unknown to me to a distant place.  We 
were travelling in a strange looking canoe.  I thought I would ask the man where he 
came from.  Then he spoke to me and said, “I know your thoughts.  You wish to ask 
me where I come from.  I will tell you.  I am the great star which goes down twice 
and which you see in the evening,” said the man.  Then I was afraid on account of 
his speech.  I awoke and I went to sleep again. (Boas 1925, p. 49) 
 
 
7.1 What is time? 
There is substantial crossover between the conceptualization of time and space in the 
Kwak’wala language.  This chapter explains what these crossovers are and grants further 
insight into Kwakwaka’wakw space through the analysis.   It helps to consider modern time and 
how it is constructed and experienced.  Then I consider how modern concepts have been 
translated into Kwak’wala but are not innate but appropriated.  Finally I consider 
Kwakwaka’wakw time as it was considered prior to the importation of modern Western 
concepts.   

334 
 
 
Time is a pervasive concept in the modern experience.  Time is ever present in our 
consciousness.  We are surrounded by devices designed to keep track of the time and our 
movements in accordance with it.  Clocks are everywhere both in the public and private realms 
reminding us what time it is and even more intimately, the majority of people wear watches 
strapped to our wrists so that we always have access to the time.  Our cell phones declare the 
time to us every time we use them.  Our relationship with time is so much a part of our everyday 
experience that we rarely question it.  But what is time?  How real is it?  How much of our 
experience of time is innate to human nature and how much of it is culturally constructed?   Do 
all cultures experience time in the same way? 
    
My research into the concept of time as expressed in the Kwak’wala language and 
Kwakwaka’wakw cultural forms indicates that while the concept of time certainly exists cross-
culturally the actual ‘conceptualization’ of what time is varies considerably (Nicolson, 2005).   
This conceptualization is deeply influential on our perceptions and experience of time.  Modern 
culture and the English language, along with the other Western languages that have been 
engaged with the development of modern Western notions of time help facilitate an experience 
of time that is particular; it is the one that dominates our experience of time today.  In the same 

335 
 
 
way, the Kwak’wala language and Kwakwaka’wakw culture also facilitate a particular 
experience of time.  This experience and understanding of time differs considerably from 
modern Western based notions.  This indicates that while there are certain fundamental cross-
cultural universals regarding time that the particular expressions and concepts about time can 
render the experience of time across cultures quite differently.  For example, the modern notion 
of ‘Indian Time’ while seen derisively from the modern Western point of view as the inability of 
Aboriginal peoples to be punctual can actually be accounted for by the difference in relationship 
to the idea of time and its correspondence to the flow of events.  ‘Indian Time’ is not an innate 
characteristic of being aboriginal but the remnant of a culturally based conceptualization of our 
relationship to time.  As we shall see in the following linguistic analysis the highly defined 
incrementalism of Western notions of time are particular to Western culture and are reflected in 
the English language as such.   
 
Both Kwak’wala and English exhibit conceptual space/time crossover.  Boroditsky (2001) states 
that “recent evidence suggests that people do not just talk about time in spatial terms, but that 
they also use their spatial knowledge to think about time” (p. 6)  Lakoff & Johnson (1999) state, 
“All of our understandings of time are relative to other concepts such as motion, space and 

336 
 
 
events” (p. 137).  The relationship between the concepts of space and time is a close one.  In 
the Kwak’wala language we see similar conceptual structure across the two domains. 
 
         Time is as basic a concept as we have.  Yet time, in English and in other language 
is, for the most part, not conceptualized and talked about on its own terms.  Very 
little of our understanding of time is purely temporal.  Most of our understanding of 
time is a metaphorical version of our understanding of motion in space…and motion 
is defined as the change in location over time. (p. 139) 
 
We borrow understandings from space in order to frame our understanding of time.  So what 
are the crossover metaphors that emerge from the Kwak’wala language regarding time 
concepts?  We could start with asking what is the word for time in Kwak’wala?   There doesn’t 
appear to be any directly translatable word for time directly equivalent to English.  The word 
‘wa’wayas is derived from the stem ‘wa- meaning ‘to measure’.  Boas gives the word 
‘wa’wasdam as equivalent to ‘wa’wayas. 
 
(490)      ‘wa’wayas                       “time” (Boas 1948:73) 

337 
 
 
(491)      ‘wa’wasdam                    “time” (Boas 1948:73) 
(492)      ‘wa’wasalił                       “time in house” (Boas 1948:73 
 
The conceptual connection between time and space is made apparent by the word for ‘length’ 
which shares the root ‘wa-. 
 
(493)      ‘wasgam                        “ length” (Boas 1948:73) 
(494)      ‘wadzak                          “measure across” (Boas 1948:74) 
(495)      ‘wadzagas                      “diameter” (Boas 1948:74) 
 
The relationship between space and time is further emphasized by the suffix -as meaning ‘place 
of’.  Boas states ‘”While this suffix designates primarily place, it also has many derived 
meanings such as time, size, number, way of.”  
 
(496)     ‘waxax’anxi’las                  “number of years” (Boas 1947:305) 
                    measure  time/season  place of/time of 
 
(497)      ‘wa’la’as                            “place of stopping” (Boas 1947:318) 
                       stop   place of 
 
(498)      xandzas                            “ nose , place of sniffling” (Boas 1947:318) 
 
 

338 
 
 
The auxiliary stem hi- which can be translated as ‘that’ attaches to an allomorph of -as ‘place of’ 
to form he’mis  “time of” or “that place”.  We can see in this construction the delineation of a 
‘certain time’ equated to a ‘certain place’.   The following expression is possible: 
 
(499)     He’misan ba’was.                 “That was the time of my leaving” (Boas1947:319) 
 
 
The following example also exhibits the conflation of time with space: 
 
 
(500)     ‘yaḱaga’las                             “time of speaking” (Boas 1947:319) 
  
 
These examples give us some idea as to how time concepts crossover with space concepts in 
the Kwak’wala language.   
 
The next few topics will deal with the introduction of Western time concepts and the Kwak’wala 
language forms that have been constructed to accommodate them.  My point in making this 
delineation and analyzing the following word structures is that the concepts underlying these 
new structures arise out of Western cultural practice and industrialization.  They are not 
intrinsically Kwakwaka’wakw.  That being said, they are part of the process of Western cultural 

339 
 
 
integration we have been participating in over the last few hundred years.  Also, of interest are 
the forms that Kwak’wala uses to adopt foreign concepts.   
 
To ask “What is the time?” in reference to a clock is a relatively new concept introduced with 
modern Western notions of time increments.  This is evidenced in the following morphological 
analysis of the sentence.  
 
(501)       Luxw –gan-ťsakila’?             “What time is it?” 
          A round group- how many?- pointed at object 
 
 
The sentence begins with luxw- which Boas (1948) translates as “to roll round thing”. (p.404)  It 
could be translated as a group of things that go together with a circular reference.   Possibly it 
refers to the round face of the clock with the numbers forming a circle.  The second morpheme, 
gan[s]- translates as “how many”, while -ťsakila’ refers to long objects.  The long object in this 
case may refer to the shape of the clocks hands.  So the translation might read loosely as “How 
many, or which number is the pointed object (hands) at?”   This is a literal interpretation of the 
Western act of counting time with a clock.  It is not a concept indigenous to Kwak’wala but one 
that adapts Kwak’wala morphological forms and expressions to fit as accurately as possible an 
imported concept of incrementing time into hours. 

340 
 
 
The following basic response pattern also reflects the morphological structure and conceptual 
logic of the question:  Luxw ganťsakila’?  “What time is it?”   Examples (502)-(513) are cited  
from Nunwakola Cultural Society (2006).          
 
(502)    La’muxw ‘nam-ťsakila.   “It is one o’clock.”  Or more literally;  “It is pointed at one.” 
                  It is                one     pointed at 
 
 
The following times on the hour follow in the same pattern from one to eleven. 
 
 
(503)     La’muxw mał-ťsakila.                    It is two o’clock.        “It is pointed at two” 
(504)     La’muxw yudaxw- ťsakila.             It is three o’clock.     “It is pointed at three” 
(505)     La’muxw mu-ťsakila.                      It is four o’clock.        “It is pointed at four” 
(506)     La’muxw saḱa-ťsakila.                   It is five o’clock.        “It is pointed at five” 
(507)     La’muxw ḱaťła-ťsakila.                   It is six o’clock           “It is pointed at six” 
(508)     La’muxw adłabu-ťsakila.                 It is seven o’clock      “It is pointed at seven”    
(509)     La’muxw ma’łgwa’nał-ťsakila.         It is eight o’clock      “It is pointed at eight”   
(510)     La’muxw ŉaŉa’ma-ťsakila.              It is nine o’clock      “It is pointed at nine”  
(511)     La’muxw la’stu-ťsakila.                    It is ten o’clock      “It is pointed at ten” or 
(512)     La’muxw naka- ťsakila.                    It is ten o’clock     “It is pointed at ten”                      

341 
 
 
(513)     La’muxw ŉamagu-ťsakila.                It is eleven o’clock      “It is pointed at eleven”   
 
 
It is not until the twelfth hour marker that we get a response that rather than reflecting the 
attempt to map Kwak’wala onto a foreign concept of time we get an indigenous response; a 
response which already exists in the Kwak’wala lexicon.  “It is twelve o’clock.” can be directly 
translated either as “It is noon.” or “It is midnight” 
 
(514)     La’muxw nak-ela            “It is noon.” 
                     it is                 middle 
 
(515)     La’muxw nag-ige’           “It is midnight.”  
                    it is            middle on back 
 
 
Both words take their root meaning from the stem morpheme nak- which means “straight or 
direct” (Boas 1947 p.228)71  This can be translated as “in the middle” when considered spatially.  
If something is directly in front of you it is “in the middle” of the visual field.  Noon is in the middle 
of the day, straight ahead of us as the sun reaches its’ apex.  Midnight is somewhat more 
intriguing.  The suffix -ige’ is a locative that can be translated as “on the back”.   Together the 
root  nak- and the suffix -ige’ combine to create “middle or straight on the back”.  These words 
are fundamentally Kwakwaka’wakw in their conceptualization and map directly onto the English 
                                                 
71 In the Kwak’wala words mid-day (noon) to midnight the change from back “k” to “g” is simply phonological.     

342 
 
 
concepts of ‘mid-day’ and ‘mid-night’, unlike the numbered times which are Western in concept 
with applied Kwak’wala forms.    The word for midnight is particularly intriguing in that it 
references a spatial location in reference to the body.  It is possible that the moon is described 
as being on the middle of the “back” of the world as if the world was a body. 
 
In considering the concept of hours we find that an ‘hour’ is an increment of time developed out 
of a Western cultural framework of time measurement.  While contemporary Kwak’wala 
speakers created a new form that can express the concept of hours, the further reduced 
increment of ‘minutes’ is not even attempted.  The closest that can be translated is to express 
that the hands of the clock are either ‘approaching, coming up to’ the hour or ‘just past’ the hour.  
These ideas are constructed from words which reference the movement of objects in space  
‘alak  meaning “almost” and heka meaning “to pass”. 
 
(516)     La’muxw hekak muťsakila.          “It has passed four o’clock.” 
(517)     La’muxw ‘alak muťsakila.            “It is approaching four o’clock.” 
 

343 
 
 
There are no minutes or seconds in Kwak’wala.  The way of expressing hours is an adopted 
concept and only the markers of time ‘noon’ and ‘midnight are indigenous to the language.  The 
next section outlines the more customary way of marking time throughout the day and their 
morphological breakdown is revealing of how the passage of time is conceptualized. 
 
7.2 Temporal markers throughout the day in Kwak’wala 
If the hourly markers of time given in the previous examples are a relatively new form of 
expressing time concepts in the Kwak’wala language then the following examples document 
daily temporal marking as it may have been expressed before the introduction of Western based 
time measurement.  The words for the most part appear to take their form from the description 
of light and the position of the sun. 
 
(518)     ŉa-x’id                                         “becoming daylight, bright” (Grubb 1971:61) 
             daylight – becoming (inchoative) 
 
(519)     ŉeŉakw-ala72                                 “daybreak, going home” (Grubb 1971:61) 
                   returning home – ongoing action (aspect) 
 
(520)     ga’-ala                                          “morning, early” (Grubb 1971:103) 
                   early(long ago) – ongoing action (aspect) 
                                                 
72 Possibly two words ‘na-‘nakwala “daybreak” or literally “light-gradually” and ‘ne’nakwala “going home” 

344 
 
 
(521)     nak-ela                                          “mid-day” (Grubb 1971:102) 
                   middle – ongoing action (aspect)

This list of words describes the light conditions of the day from dawn throughout the day and 
into the night, which then begins again with dawn.  Figure 7.1 illustrates this movement.  It 
should be noted that the “evening” has four different words for its description and that there are 
two words for “daybreak or dawn”.

346 
 
 
7.2.1 ‘Nala, the word for day, nagige’, the word for midnight 
 
It is within the temporal word for “day” that we see a strong spatial connection with “the world”. 
In the following selection of words connected to the word ‘nala “day”, note the diversity of 
associated meanings.    
 
(529)     ‘na-            “stem meaning ‘day, daylight, upstream, south, east’”  
                               (Boas 1948:241) 
                               “light, sky, world, dawn, south” (Boas 1931:165) 
 
(530)     ‘nala             ‘up river, south, world (Boas 1947:228) 
 
(531)     ‘nala             ‘day, earth’ (Curtis 1914:334) 
 
(532)     ‘nala            ‘day, sea and heavens’ (Barrett 1966:77)  
 
(533)     ŉala              ‘day’ (Grubb 1971:61) 
 
 
Curtis’ (1915) vocabulary gives the meaning for ŉala as both “day” and “earth”.  The word 
‘awi’nagwis is listed under the Kwagu’ł and ‘Awikinuxw dialects for “earth” but the word ŉala is 
given for Gusgimuxw and T’łaťłasikwala dialects (p. 334).  Barrett’s (1966) collection notes give 
a linguistic breakdown of the word ŉala as meaning “day, sea and heavens” (p. 77).   
‘Nalanukwamgi’lakw is the name of a Gwawa’enuxw ancestor.  The name translates as “Born to 
be Head of the World”.  These varied meanings for ‘nala provide clues to a broader 

347 
 
 
conceptualization of ‘nala in relationship to space and time.   If ‘nala as ‘day’ and ‘nala as 
“world” are compared for similarity we could say that ‘nala, as “day” represents the stage or 
background (timeframe) upon which temporal activities are defined while as “world” it exists as 
the background (stage) upon which activities take place.   Both contexts provide a bounded 
region.  The day is bounded in time by the cyclical movement of the sun while the earth/world is 
bounded by physical space.  This interpretation might account for Barrett’s translation of “sea 
and heaven” as both these spaces can also be defined as bounded regions within the world 
where activities take place.   This conflagration of time and space might also account for the 
dual meaning of nagige’ which can mean “midnight” but also “middle of back”.  If the day or the 
world is seen as an entity of bounded space then when the moon is in the middle the sky is 
conceptualized as the ‘back’ of that bounded space. In temporal context the word ‘nala as “day”, 
delineates when events occur.   In spatial context ‘nala represents “the world”; a bounded area 
of space where events occur.  That Kwak’wala uses the same word to represent these two 
concepts indicates their temporal/spatial inter-connectedness.   
 
 
 
 
 

348 
 
 
7.2.2  Neŉakwala, the word for “dawn, the break of day”  
  
This leads us to consider also ‘ne’nakwala, the word for “daybreak or dawn”.  This word can 
also mean “returning home”.   Boas (1948) gives the meaning of the root ‘na- as “day, daylight, 
upstream, south, east”.  If old village sites were situated upstream, then a return home would 
require travel in that direction.  A poetic possibility is the idea that the dawning of the sun was 
considered the return of the day or a homecoming of sorts.   Regardless of the definitive 
explanation of these three words and their applied meanings, which remains speculative, the 
point I want to make is that these words clearly mark deviations from English or Western 
conceptualizations and begin to exhibit extensions of meanings that rise out of a 
Kwakwaka’wakw cultural paradigm and hint at a different way of perceiving and expressing the 
concept of time. 
 
 One thing to consider is whether it is possible that these are merely homonyms; two words that 
are spelled and sound alike but have completely different meanings.  While homonyms do exist 
in the Kwak’wala language they are not as profuse as in English.  The reason for this is the 
polysynthetic nature of Kwak’wala.  Kwak’wala words are made up of a stem with attached 
suffixes.  The stem gives the word its’ primary meaning and the attached suffixes modify that 

349 
 
 
meaning.  The structural character of Kwak’wala words renders it less likely that words sharing 
a stem will not share the stem’s meaning.   In the case of ‘nala the attachment of suffixes can 
create words such as the following: 
 
(534)     ‘nala-kants                         “our world” (Boas 1947:296) 
              world        our 
 
 
(535)     ‘na-gila                               “to live, act, until dawn or to make weather” (Boas 1948:241) 
                   day/weather – to make 
 
(536)     ‘na-’nala-xsila                     “to influence weather with magic” (Boas 1948:241) 
              plural73 – day/weather –to work at 
 
(537)     ‘na’nala-lał                          “the weather dance” (Boas 1848:241) 
              plural – day/weather – dancer 
 
 
 
The association with weather tends to tie together the notions of the ‘day’ with the ‘world’.  
Weather is what takes place during the day and in the world.  In this regard there are two 
dances in particular that are expressions of “the day”.  The first one is danced wearing a mask 
called ‘nax’nakagamł  “dawning of the day or sunrise mask”.  Boas (1897) describes the 
‘nax’nakagamł  as “an immense mask, the mouth of which is made so that it can open wide.  
                                                 
73 Plurality, repetition and distribution are expressed by repetition (reduplication) of the first syllable in 
Kwak’wala. (Boas 1947:219)   I have written plural here but it is possible this is a distributive meaning 
spread out in space which makes sense in relationship to weather. 

350 
 
 
Therefore it is also called haxilagam “the yawning face”.  The opening mouth means that the 
day is yawning when the dawn appears.” (p, 484) i.e. the world opens its mouth wide and the 
sun emerges from it.   Sometimes this mask takes the form of a bird or human face “with “wings” 
on either side, which are painted on the outside with a black serpentlike figure.  White spots 
decorate the outside portion of the “wings” and may refer to the night sky.” (Bill Holm, personal 
communication in Jonaitis, 1991, p 127).  A version of this dance was given to the Guṕinuxw, 
who were living near Quatsino Sound when the world was still in darkness.  Daylight was kept in 
a box by a woman named ‘Nenala’aťsega of the Gusgimaxw.  A man named Kwixalalagalis was 
able to trick her into giving him the box and he released the sun to the world.  The sun then 
gave him a sisi’utł dance and the sunrise mask called Ikťsamatusalagalis (abalone shell from 
one end of the world to another). “In this manner the Guṕinuxw obtained the sunrise mask 
(‘nax’nakagamł) and its red cedar bark.” (pp, 410-411)  The words to a ‘nax’nakagamł  song are 
translated as:  
 
             You will rise, you known by all around the edge of the world   
             You will rise, famous everywhere at edge of the world  
             You will rise, being vanquished, rival chiefs of the world 

351 
 
 
           They say that I beg food from the rival chiefs of the world 
           (Boas 1897, p. 714) 
 
There appears to be a metaphorical reference to the rising of the sun (dawn at the edge of the 
world) and the presence of the chief amongst the people who is likened to “being above” his 
rivals.   
 
The second dance that is related to the day is called ‘na’nalalał “day or weather dance” Curtis 
(1915) calls this “the embodiment of the personation74 of weather” (p.158).   This dance has 
sometimes been confused with the ‘nalalał “swan dance” perhaps due to the similarity of the 
words ‘nala “day” and ‘nala “laughing goose (or swan)” (Boas, 1921, p. 1416).   In a reference to 
the daybreak it is said that the dancers “wear a headdress shaped like a bird and dance back 
and forth in front of the singers. The dancers cover and uncover their faces, indicating the break 
of dawn.” (Umista, 1981, Vol 12, p. 41 )  Figure 7.2 shows the dance outfit for the na’nalalał 
(daylight/weather dance).  The woman has been identified as Sarah Constance Smith (Abaya), 
granddaughter of George Hunt, who later in life was married to Mungo Martin. 
                                                 
74 Curtis uses the word “personation” which could also be stated as “personification”.

7.3 Temporal extensions beyond the ‘day’ 
 
‘Nala  “the day” acts as a fundamental unit of Kwak’wala time.   The time frame of a “day” is 
then incremented by the list of descriptive words (518)-(528) much like how a “day” in English is 
incremented by “hours”.   Word examples (518)-(528) represent the internal structure of time 
throughout a day in the Kwak’wala language prior to contact which influenced the innovations 
that can be translated as “one o’clock, two o’clock etc. listed in examples (502)-(513).  The 
following set of words, refer to or are built off of, the fundamental unit of “a day” and extend 
outwards. This operates in a similar fashion to how a week is an extension of a day into a larger 
unit of time measurement in English.  What we must be conscious of is that the word “week” is a 
particular cultural construction.  I say ‘in particular’ because while the concept of ‘a day’ still 
references the movement of the earth around the sun, and a month references the cycles of the 
moon, the unit of a week comes out of Western industrialization, not natural cycles.  A week is 
constructed of five days for work and two days for rest.  Similar to the more recent introduction 
of hourly timekeeping in Kwak’wala we find new constructions for describing the days of the 
week.  These are new constructions.  They did not exist in the Kwak’wala language prior to the 
introduction of Westernization.  They are Kwak’wala forms mapped onto a Western concept.  If 
we break down these new words we can see how they function. 

354 
 
 
7.3.1 Kwak’wala word innovations applied to the foreign concept of “a week” 
The following list is the word innovations that contemporary Kwak’wala speakers have come up 
with for days of the week. 
 
 
(538)      iḱila -’anx                                “Sunday” (www.firstvoices.com) 
              good      season (time of) 
 
(539)      ‘nam-ṕan-xwaťs-anx               “Monday” (www.firstvoices.com) 
                    one    time    days76     season (time of) 
 
 
(540)     mał-ṕan-xwaťs-anx                  “Tuesday” (www.firstvoices.com) (Grubb 1971, p.144) 
                   two      times     days     season (time of) 
 
(541)     yudaxw-ṕan-xwaťs-anx             “Wednesday” (www.firstvoices.com) 
              three           times    days     season (time of) 
 
(542)     mu-ṕan-xwaťs-anx                     “Thursday” (www.firstvoices.com) 
              four   times  days       season (time of) 
 
(543)     saḱa-ṕan-xwaťs-anx                   “Friday” (www.firstvoices.com) 
                   five       times    days      season(time of) 
 
(544)     naxs’andi                                     “Saturday” (Boas 1948:229) 
                   half  days work 
 
 
                                                 
76 I am not completely confident of my translation for this affix.  Boas (1947:240) gives (-xwa’s) as a suffix for 
‘days’.  The weakening of the back x to x and the hardening of the ‘s to ‘ts may be due to phonological 
consideration. 

355 
 
 
The division of days into five working days and two off days is maintained in the new 
constructions.  From Monday to Friday we have a conceptually simple construction of numeral 
stems plus suffixes for “times”, “days”, and “season of”.  For Saturday, we have the construction 
for a half day’s work which indicates an earlier historical time period for the words’ inception.   
For Sunday the translation of ‘good’ may refer to the act of going to church and of not working.  
Again, within the translation of this word we have an indication of an earlier historical time period 
when the Kwakwaka’wakw  were beginning to observe Christian belief systems.  The 
deconstruction of modern Kwak’wala terminology for days of the week, reveal it to be an 
introduced system with the advent of Westernization.   
 
The following forms appear to originate prior to Western contact, and the list gives an idea of 
how time beyond the increment of a day was conceptualized.    
 
(545)     ye - xwa ŉala                            “ today” (Grubb 1971, p.142) 
              of         the      day 
 
(546)     or, ye - xoxda ŉala 
                          of         the          day 
 
(547)     łans -tł -a77                                   “tomorrow” (Grubb 1971, p.142) 
              one day distant – future tense 
                                                 
77 Sometimes pronounced łanstłe 

356 
 
 
(548)      łans -’wał                                    “yesterday” (Grubb 1971, p.155) 
              one day distant – remote past 
 
(549)     hi’- luxw -sa                                 “day after tomorrow” (www.firstvoices.com) 
                  something added - round object  
 
(550)     hi- ’luxw -su’ł                               “day before yesterday” (Grubb 1971, p.61) 
                  something added-  round object – remote past 
 
 
 
If ‘nala refers to the day as an object bounded by time then yexwa ŉala or yexoxda ŉala refers 
to “today”, or “the day” placed within present tense.  “It is happening now” within the bounded 
temporal frame of a day.   The temporal present of today is then extended outwards in both 
directions into the future and the past.  The Kwak’wala language includes one and two day 
length extensions to ‘tomorrow’ and ‘the day after tomorrow’, and ‘yesterday’ and ‘the day after 
yesterday’. It is interesting to note that the furthest extensions from the present tense hi’luxwsa  
and hi’luxwsu’ł  begin with the stem hi- which is defined by Boas as “that, in a straight direction 
to a distant point”, reinforcing a spatial analogy to distance in time.  A possible derivation of this 
stem is hi’lu- “something added” which refers to ideas around “growth” or “of building up” or 
“extending” which are spatial concepts.  
 
(551)   hi’lala                                          “something added” (Boas 1948:104) 

357 
 
 
(552)   hi’lux’wid                                    “to come to be of right size, to grow up” (Boas 1948:104) 
(553)   hi’luband                                     “to extend end” (Boas 1948:104) 
(554)   hi’luxwsa (?)78                               “three days” (Boas 1948:105) 
(555)   hi’luxwsu’ł (?)                              “three days ago (Boas 1948:105) 
(556)   hi’lulisala                                     “to grow to old age” (Boas 1948:105) 
 
The hi’lu- stem has both temporal meaning (the adding on of time) as well as spatial meaning 
(the adding on of height or length).    I am not sure why Boas noted the meaning as three days 
removed in examples (554) and (555).  Other sources Grubb (1977) and FirstVoices, as well as 
contemporary speakers, consider the meaning to be an extension of two days.  Figure 7.3 is a 
construction of Kwakwaka’wakw time beyond a ‘day’ in the same way that Western 
incrementalism conceives of a week as beyond a ‘day’.  As we can see the structure is quite 
different in how it manifests.  A Western structure includes the concepts of ‘today’, ‘tomorrow’ 
and ‘yesterday’ but ‘the day after tomorrow’ and ‘the day after yesterday’ are not utilized enough 
in English to warrant independent words.  The temporal framing beyond a “day” which in English

is a “week” becomes instead a framed extension of two days outwards from the present 
moment which is “today”.

7.3.2  La’am “now” 
La’am can be translated as “now”.  It infers the immediate.  La’am is constructed from the root 
auxiliary meaning ‘”to go”.  In speech la- is an introduction to movement along a narrative or 
event occurrence.  For instance: 
 

359 
 
 
(557)     La-tł-an a’edakał la-xa kalwilas           “I’m going back to the store”  
                    go future I       return      to the        store               (www.firstvoices.com) 
 
 
(558)     ...la-’a’las ‘na-x’ida                              “ …it began to be light” (Berman,1991:327) 
                        go     place   light  began 
 
 
(559)     la’am lawis gigals kasa                       “now, they walked for a long time” (Boas,1966: vi) 
                  now   there where for a long time walk 
 
(560)     la’am mixił gada babi’x                        “the baby is going to sleep (now)”  
                    now   sleep   this here  baby                            (Nunwakola, 2006) 
 
(561)     la’am iḱułala gada wa’x                       “the river is rising (now)” (Nunwakola, 2006) 
                    now  rising high this here river 
 
 
La’am is a component of event structure.  When we talk about time we must also consider 
events and how they are situated ‘in time’.  Boas describes la- as a motion away from the 
speaker, which contrasts with gax- a motion towards the speaker (Boas 1947, p. 287).  If we 
consider this meaning when applied to la’am then we can see how the spatial relationship of 
“moving away from” is then applied in a temporal sense to “what is happening now, or 
immediately”.  All other time frames outside of ‘the now’ are movements away from it.  This is 
why I have situated la’am under the day as the central concept or moment from which events 
are extended outwards in Figure 7.3.  Berman also addresses the temporal quality of la- and 
gax- when she states “… that la- and gax- auxiliaries also express a temporal idea.  This 

360 
 
 
temporal idea might be best described as ongoingness or sequentiality in space or time. An 
action described by a verb in a clause beginning with la- or gax- , especially in the main clause, 
simply follows in time the action described in the preceding clause.” (Berman 1991, p. 336) 
The connection between la-, gax- and he- is the movement in space.  While la’am anchors a 
moment in time and space, other sentence initial phrases beginning with la- express the 
movement away from this position “the position of now”.   Gax- also signals a movement in 
space and time away from an initial position and he-, especially in the form hi’lu- expresses 
extensions in space and time.  
 
 
7.4 Kwak’wala tense and aspect 
 
‘Tense’, or the situating of events in time (present, past and future) along with ‘aspect’, the 
description of events in time (ongoing, momentary, inchoative [to begin to] etc.) branch off from 
this discussion and are both integral to a full exploration of Kwakwaka’wakw time concepts.  
Both words, łans’wał   “yesterday” and hi’luxwsu’ł 79 “day before yesterday” contain the remote 
past tense suffix –oł [-wał].   Łanstła  utilizes the future tense marker -tł. 
   
                                                 
79 Underlying form is –oł. The vowel tends to shift between /o/ and /u/.

(563)     i’axala-x’id-an                                “I was working (awhile ago)” 
               work         was    I                                             or “I used to work” (29/04/2013 
 
(564)     gila-oł-ex ‘nagalis-ants ‘nalax         “when long ago first light came into our world”  
              come  long ago  light        our      world                                                      (Boas,1947:289)                                      
 
 
Future tense:  single form   (-tł-) 
 
(565)     i’axala-tł-an81                                    “I will be working” (29/04/2013) 
              work       FT    I 
 
 
Unlike English, which applies tense only to verbs, Kwak’wala tense can be applied to both verbs 
and nouns.  The final past tense form –oł [-wał] when attached to nouns or names gives the 
meaning past, or gone from this world. 
 
(566)     gax-’anga-’an ump ’wał-a’               “in my dream my late father came” (Boas 1947:289) 
             come  in a dream  my   father  past 
 
 
                                                 
80 I have found that vowel shift occurs between /i/ and /e/ in pronunciation of the word to work. Could 
possibly be a dialect difference.   I have defaulted to the spelling i’axala for “work”  rather than e’axala 
because the majority of written sources spell it this way. 
81 Sometimes pronounced e’axalatłan (vowel shift between (i) and (e). 

362 
 
 
There appears to exist an immediate future tense relationship between la’am “now” and la’mis 
“so now” indicating actions which move forward into the present while closely originating from 
the present.   
 
(567)     La’ams loł gagwadatłasan gukwa kan.      Now you will be the house owner of  
                                                                                  this my house (Boas 1947:289) 
 
 
–oł [-wał]  and -xd  past tense forms are suffixed to names and objects considered dead or 
destroyed (having experienced a fundamental change of state, a change of state from the 
‘now’).  -xd  means “existing in the past”, while –oł [-wał]  means “situated far in the past”  which 
can be conceived of as meaning “completely off the stage of the present” (here and now), or “no 
longer here or now”.  The intermediate past tense -x’id  has a complicated relationship with an 
aspectual form -x’id which is phonetically an exact replica. 
   
According to Bauer (2004), aspect is “a morphological category (usually marked on the verb) 
which provides information on the internal temporal make-up of the action denoted by that 
verb”(p. 18).  An example of aspect in English is –ing  in the word running.  The –ing  indicates 
that the action is “ongoing” or “continuous”.  Aspect provides information on the internal 

363 
 
 
structure of an event; whether it is ongoing or complete, a single event or in an ongoing state 
that does not change.  According to Boas (1947) Kwak’wala has four main aspectual suffixes: 
 
(568)     -a                                “single action or continuous state” (Boas 1947:290) 
(569)     -x’id                            “the change from one state to another” (Boas 1947:290) 
(570)     -ala                             “multiplicity, repetition or continuity” (Boas 1947:291) 
(571)      -ała                            “to be in the position of performing some action” (Boas 1947:291) 
  
While past tense -x’id  has the meaning ‘having occurred in the not so recent past”, the 
aspectual -x’id encompasses the meanings “momentaneous and inchoative”. “Momentaneous” 
describes an instantaneous or very limited amount of time for the action and “inchoative” 
describes a transition of state “to begin to”.  In order to understand “momentaneous” more 
clearly in Kwak’wala we can compare it to another aspectual suffix, (-ala [-ala]) which describes 
an ongoing or pluralistic action; ‘multiplicity, repetition or continuity’. 
 
(572)     danx-ala                        “singing” (ongoing, stretched out in time) 
                   sing       Aspect (ONGOING) 
 
 

364 
 
 
(573)     danx-’id                         “to sing” (a conceptually singular act, compressed in time) 
              sing     Aspect (MOMENTANEOUS) 
 
(574)     danx-’id-an                     “I sang.” (a conceptually singular act, compressed in time) 
                   sing   Tense   I 
 
 
The ‘inchoative’ aspectual (-x’id) renders forms like the following: 
 
 
(575)     ťsaxḱa-x’ida                    “He began to feel sick.” (Boas 1947:290) 
              sick             Aspect (INCHOATIVE) 
 
(576)     bagwanam-x’id                “to become a man” (Boas 1947:291) 
                   man                   Aspect (INCHOATIVE) 
 
 
What appears to unify the aspectual -x’id and the tense -x’id  forms is the idea of transformation.  
With aspect we see that “something has begun to be”.  For example, “He became a man.” or 
“He began to feel sick.” Both indicate a marked change of state.  To understand the idea of 
transformation in the Kwakwaka’wakw mindset we need to consider it as the sudden 
transformation of a thunderbird or a wolf into a man, not the gradual growth of a boy into a man.   
The moment marked in time is compressed and instantaneous as opposed to the aspectual -ala 
which is ‘ongoing’ and ‘repetitive’ in character.   All past tense forms carry some indication of a 
change of state.  Most markedly the -xd and -oł  past tense markers when attached to names 

365 
 
 
indicate that the person referred to has died.   We can extend this application to the tense -x’id 
suffix as indicating a ‘change of state’ or a transformation.  
  
As evidenced by the use of three past tense markers that the Kwakwaka’wakw consciousness 
of the past is amplified.  This is a cultural amplification of the type discussed prior in chapter 4 
with the morpheme ga- “close to source of origin” and in chapter 6 with the morpheme  
‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver, the best, the oldest”.      It is also of interest to note that the past tense forms 
act like a deictic in time rather than space.  In Figure 7.4 the stem forms ga-, yu- and he- 
indicate spatial distance between the speaker (source of origin) and the subject as ‘close by’, 
‘around’ and further away, removed’, the past tense forms correspond to these three divisions 
according to distance in time, ‘just occurred’, ‘having occurred further in the past’ and ‘having 
occurred long ago’.

7.5  Months and seasons, the suffix  -anx 
Unlike ‘hours’ or ‘days of the week’ which take their conceptual structure from Western time 
measurement, months and seasons have some conceptual consistency with pre-contact 
Kwakwaka’wakw time measurement.  This mostly likely is due to the fact that both take their 
cues from natural cycles.  This being said, they do not map entirely but differ in some respects.   
The suffix -anx  means “season, or time of” which can also be extended to mean “years”.  For 
instance, the passing of a winter season and its return can be considered the passing of a year. 
The primary seasons are two, ťsaẃanx  “the winter season” and hi’anx  “the summer season”.  
These two seasons had extreme cultural significance.  The winter season was the ceremonial 
EVENT 
   (HERE)     ga- “close by”         yu-“around”          he- “further away”              IN SPACE   
 (NOW)     -xd “just happened”  -x’id “further away in time”  -u’ł “long ago”    IN TIME 

367 
 
 
season and the summer was considered the time of resource gathering and preservation of 
food for winter.  These seasons were given the ceremonial terms ťsiťseka  “sacred” and baxwas 
“secular”.  Of less significance are the seasons hi’anxṕa ‘nakwela  “coming summer” or “spring” 
and ło’yanx  “autumn”.  
 
(577)     hi’anxṕa ŉakwala              “spring, coming summer” (Grubb 1971;133; Boas, 1947:241) 
(578)     hi’anx                                 “summer” (Grubb 1971:136) 
(579)     ło’yanx                                “autumn” (Grubb 1977:39) 
(580)     ťsaẃanx                              “winter” (Grubb 1971:152) 
 
 
7.5.1 Months of the Year 
 
The months of the year are loosely connected to the time frame of a month calculated from the 
cycles of the moon but not explicitly.  They also utilize the suffix -anx  “season of, time for” and 
most often reflect harvesting activity.  An early list surveying the names of the “months” for four 
of the Kwakwaka’wakw tribes was compiled by George Hunt and Franz Boas (1909).  The 
‘Namgis and Mamalilikala lists are closely matched from April to September and December but 
vary in the other months.  The lists provided for the Naḱwaxda’xw and Gusgimuxw tribes vary 

368 
 
 
considerably; though all four tribes give berry seasons, conditions of the moon, and fishing 
conditions as ‘months / times for’.  Of particular interest are the months which translate as ‘nula 
or ‘na’nulasnakagila “elder brother” or tikwabo’i  “under [elder brother]” and i’dabo’i  “next one 
under [elder brother]” which may relate to phases of the moon in a culturally specific way.  
Figure 7.5 is an adaptation of Boas’ 1909 list.

We cannot take this list to be exhaustive nor comprehensive as seasonal name variety would 
have manifested itself across various tribes living in slightly different geographies.  We should 
consider this list a sample only across four tribal areas of the Kwakwaka’wakw. 
 
7.5.2  Seasons and Years 
 
The suffix -anx can be translated as “time for” in contemporary speech in relationship to “season 
of”.  However, the foundation of this suffix is conceptually grounded in the act of harvesting as 
indicated by the existence of the related suffix -x’anx [-xakw]   “place where there is much of 

371 
 
 
something”.   Again, we see spatial and temporal crossover.   We could say that the extension 
of “time for” from “season of” is an abstraction of the meaning rendering it less specific.  We 
have the following words which utilize this suffix in their construction and we can see how this 
abstraction functions in a broader sense.  
 
(595)     kwisa’yanx’wał                             “last year” 
                    far away time/season  long ago 
 
(596)     namx’anx                                      “one winter, one year” (Boas 1947:305) 
              one     time/season  
 
(597)     ma’ł’anx                                        “two winters, two years” (Boas 1947:305) 
              two     time/season  
 
(598)     yudax’wanx                                   “three winters, three years” (Boas 1947:305) 
              three  time/season  
 
(599)      mux’wanx                                     “four winters, four years” (Boas 1947:305) 
               four  time/season  
 
(600)      saḱax’anx                                     “five winters, five years” (Boas 1947:305) 
                     five  time/season  
 
(601)      ḱaťłax’anx                                     “six winters, six years” (Boas 1947:305) 
                    six  time/season  
 
(602)     nakax’anxala                                  “ten winters, ten years” (Boas 1947:305) 
                    ten  time/season distributive 
 
 

372 
 
 
When we consider the broader application of suffix -anx  for season we realize that it applies to 
a sense of cyclical time period but not necessarily to a set length of time such as a ‘month’ or a 
‘year’ but actually can refer to both.  The true nature of the suffix is the idea of an event that 
cycles and returns.  It is considered to take up a certain “space” within the temporal stage of a 
annual cycle of a year.  The most significant markers of these “annual returns” are berry picking, 
fishing, and ceremonialism.  Figure 7.6 Shows a Gwaťsinuxw (Quatsino) woman picking berries 
around 1900.

7.6 The ťsiťseka  “winter ceremonial”: conceptual extensions and associations 
 
The major ceremony of the Kwakwaka’wakw is the ťsiťseka, or as it has been translated “the 
winter ceremony”.  This translation is not literal of course.  Boas’ (1966) attempt at literal 
translation defined the ťsiťseka as “to be fraudulent, to cheat”. 

374 
 
 
        The period of the winter ceremonial, which begins in November and last well into the 
following year, is called ťsiťseka or ťsiťsa’eka also iḱikala, to be good-minded or 
happy.  The name is curious, for ťsaka means “to be fraudulent, to cheat.”  For 
instance, when a person wishes to find out if a shaman has real power or if his 
power is based on pretence, he uses the term “pretended, fraudulent, made-up 
shaman” (ťsagakw paxala).  Even in the most serious presentations of the 
ceremonial, it is clearly and definitely stated that it is planned as a fraud. (p. 172) 
 
Boas’ translation of the name ťsiťseka  is very literal.  The notion of fraudulent may very well 
just refer to the idea that the ceremonies are imitative or reflections of events that originally 
happened at another place in time.  Regardless of Boas’ speculation regarding the meaning of 
the name, the non-literal translation of the word ťsiťseka as “the winter ceremony” refers to the 
heavy symbolism that this season and its accompanying ceremonies are embedded in. 
 
         The contrast between the scared and the secular seasons is expressed by the 
Indians by saying that in summer the secular quality is on top; in winter the sacred 
quality…The theory of the winter ceremonial is based on the belief that in winter, 

375 
 
 
certain supernatural beings, who reside in summer in distant countries, come to the 
village. (p. 172) 
 
 
The summer months are spent gathering foods in preparation for winter when food is not 
as abundant.  The summer is associated with the physical and the body.  This is 
contrasted to winter when the focus shifts from food gathering to ceremonialism.  The 
winter is the time for spirits and the spiritual.  The summer season called baxwas  “secular 
or ordinary” (Boas 1948, p. 117), seasonally cycles with that of the ťsiťseka, which is 
associated with that which is nawalakw  “supernatural, extraordinary” (Boas 1948, p. 232).  
The summer is associated with the present, while the winter is associated with 
enactments of past encounters with ancestors and supernatural beings who bestow 
privileges on their recipients; dances, songs, names and ceremonies.   These analogies 
and conceptual connections were a pervasive and important component of 
Kwakwaka’wakw ontology.  Figure 7.7 shows the seasonal associations.

                           Figure 7.7  Winter and summer seasons and their associations 
 
An interesting collusion of the winter ceremonial state with the day/world is expressed in 
the following statement: 
        “Wa, dłaxwid kas la’os ‘wiἸa ťsuxwstoda ka lawayesos babaxusta’yakus, kaxs  
         la’ma’ax ogux’idans ‘nalax, kas duxwatłala’osaxa ťsagadzux ‘nala.” 
 
         “Now, arise, and wash your eyes, so that the secular season may come off from 
your eyes, for our season has changed, and you will see the winter dance 
season.” (Boas 1921:914) 
 
The orator uses the word ‘nala and it is translated as “season” but could certainly mean 
“world”; the summer season being akin to the “world of the ordinary” and the winter

377 
 
 
season being akin to “the world of the sacred”.   The world is where events take place in 
time and in space.   
 
The ceremonial house during the sacred season is a microcosm of the Kwakwaka’wakw 
universe and it is during this time that temporal and spatial flow is creatively and 
symbolically reconfigured. “Singers and messengers “tell the world” (niłaxa ‘nala R789.22) 
what is being done. In the sacred winter ceremonial a special messenger is sent out of the 
house to tell the world that the ceremonial is beginning…Chiefs, ”make the world smoky 
(by the fire of their feasts) (Boas 1949, p,234 & 238).  Privileges bestowed in ancient 
times on ancestors are made animate and alive through contemporary dances and 
masks.  They present themselves in the house as coming from the sea, from the woods, 
below the ground and from the sky.  The host chief becomes the personification of all 
those who have come before him.  He becomes the direct link in time from now back to 
the beginning.

7.7 Summary 
 
This chapter has attempted to lay out the conceptualization of time and its interface with 
concepts of space in the Kwak’wala language.  It begins with a look at concepts which existed 
prior to Western contact and how the introduction of Western time incrementalism has been 
translated into contemporary Kwak’wala forms.  These differences are important to establish as 
each category arises out of a particular approach to the phenomenon of time.  The concept of ‘a 
day’ is shared by both Western time conceptualization and that expressed by the Kwak’wala 
language, after that the concepts tend to diverge.   Western based time incrementalism is highly 
defined.  A day is divided into 24 hours; an hour is divided into 60 minutes and a minute is 
divided into 60 seconds.  These components of time measurement are abstracted from nature 
and applied according to uniform features of a ‘length of time’.  These are the concepts which 
underlie the existence of modern watches, clocks and scheduling.  It is a pervasive feature of all 
Western based contemporary existence.  In extension the acute awareness of time passage 
that this conceptualization of time manifests has become an integral part of Western culture.   In 
Kwak’wala, I have attempted to show that the division of the day into hours is not indigenous to 
the language but an attempt to incorporate the introduction of the Western workday and its 
modes of calculating that workday into a Kwakwaka’wakw sensibility.  In accordance, the 

379 
 
 
creation of these new forms can most likely be accounted for at the time that the 
Kwakwaka’wakw began to engage with Western based industries in the mid-19th Century.  Even 
so, they did not completely take hold until the early part of the 20th century when their reliance 
on natural resource harvesting began to be replaced by reliance on Western wage earning. 
 
Kwakwaka’wakw time concepts appear to have a heavy engagement, not with notions of 
abstract measurement, but with natural cycles.  The course of a day is delineated not by hours 
but by the conditions of light as provided by the sun.  Extending from the concept of a day 
outwards the concept of a week is shown to be equally imported from Western labour conditions 
with 20th century attempt to apply Kwak’wala forms.  The concept of a week and its translation 
into Kwak’wala is originally Western.  Figure 7.1 attempted to show what the extension of time 
beyond a day looked like prior to Western influences. Again, it is heavily anchored in the cyclical 
condition of the movements of the sun.  Two days away from the immediate moment in time is 
measured by the alternation of daylight and darkness in the same way that the measurement of 
‘years’ was noted by the cyclical alternation of winter and summer seasons.  Words for 
yesterday and tomorrow are expressed using tense forms.  The tense forms in Kwak’wala have 
particular associations which are not found in English.   Both the concept of ‘the day’ and the 

380 
 
 
concept of ‘a month’ do share some conceptual features with English.  They both emerge out of 
natural cycles.  In the case of months, the paramount feature is the condition of the moon.  
Beyond this Kwak’wala diverges from English in highlighting harvesting practices that are 
particular to the region and to the culture.  Ultimately, these differences in time 
conceptualization enable us to see that while ‘time’ exists as a phenomenon in both English and 
Kwak’wala the conceptualizations underlying the experience and expressions regarding time 
differ in their particularity.  These differences should not be underemphasized as the underlying 
concepts are heavily connected to other aspects of extended meanings and cultural belief 
systems; for example the extended meaning of the word ‘nala.  This concludes the linguistic 
analysis and cultural comparison component of this thesis.  The next chapter will explain the 
attempt at translating the concepts discussed in the preceding chapters into a contemporary 
visual art format.

8.1 Premise for the visual component  
The research presented in the written component of this thesis found that the Kwak’wala 
language and Kwakwaka’wakw traditional cultural forms exhibited in architecture, social 
structure, masks, dances and ceremonies were mutually supportive and it could be stated that 
they all had strong connections to the same underlying concepts.  Hence we see reflected 
throughout both language and culture the concept of the Body=House=Land/World metaphor.  
This is the analysis which has been presented through chapters 3-7.  In order to test the 
connections one step further my inquiry led me to consider whether it would be possible to 

382 
 
 
interpret the underlying conceptual “meanings” in a completely new “form”.  Hypothetically, the 
traditional art and architecture of the Kwakwaka’wakw should reflect the same conceptual 
under-structures (which forms Kwakwaka’wakw worldview) as Kwakwala linguistic forms as 
they would have developed together over an extended period of time within the same 
environment. 
 
Creating new forms for traditional ceremonial settings would be one way to test the 
connections between surface forms and conceptual under-structure.   I had witnessed this in 
contemporary song composition.   Songs which were composed with an understanding of the 
underlying traditional rules and concepts of compositions (the grammar of Kwakwaka’wakw 
songs) were successful new introductions into contemporary potlatching and could be 
considered consistent with tradition.   Young song composers who attempted to create new 
songs using the Kwak’wala language applied to underlying Western under-structures of 
melody, rhythm etc. appropriated from over exposure to Western musical canons failed as new 
musical introductions within a ceremonial setting.  Older people would respond to these new 
compositions by saying “It doesn’t sound right.” This was one example where imposing the 
formal surface expression of Kwak’wala onto non-Kwakwaka’wakw conceptual under-structure 

383 
 
 
created unsuccessful compositions.   It seemed from this example that the success of new 
works was more dependent upon maintaining the conceptual under-structure. To test this 
theory, could one take the same concepts i.e. “meanings” which underlay traditional 
Kwakwaka’wakw language and culture and create new “forms” to express those concepts in a 
radically different environment?   Could new forms be adapted to express the same ideas as 
long as they maintained consistently a connection to conceptual under-structure?    
 
I decided that the test would be the attempt to create contemporary artworks and situate them 
in a radically different context where the emphasis would lie with the underlying concepts or 
“meanings” and the form would be adjusted in order to express those meanings.   In these 
formal artistic executions I used the traditional Kwakwaka’wakw concepts of space that had 
emerged, through the linguistic analysis of Kwak’wala and my comparison with traditional 
Kwakwaka’wakw cultural forms, as my premise to create modern formal interpretations.   
Figure 8.1 shows the relationship of Kwakwaka’wakw  “forms” with Kwakwaka’wakw 
“meaning”.  I have aligned the “formal” with “being in the world” and having a worldly 
manifestation be that in words, houses, art, ceremonies, or stories.   I position these as 
Kwakwaka’wakw signs or significations of culture.   They are the surface manifestations or 

384 
 
 
resulting forms derived from Kwakwaka’wakw conceptual under-structure.  Conceptual under-
structure I have aligned as “meaning”, “existing in the mind”, i.e. cognitive, and ephemeral.  
They are the underlying belief systems of culture; the signified meanings “in the mind” that the 
signs are created to express “in the world”.  These concepts would be the content of new 
formal expressions using new materials.   The “X” in the diagram represents the “new signs” I 
would attempt to create to express old “meanings”.

This artistic enterprise became analogous to the history of radical acculturation of First 
Nations.   Was it possible to retain traditional concepts, meanings and worldview under 
radically changing environments and contexts?   The gallery space became a contracted 
analogy or metaphor for the contested and colonized spaces of Pacific Northwest Coast lands 
and the contracted temporal span of the exhibition became analogous to a colonial history 
steeped in radical cultural change, both linguistic and cultural.  If I could strategically occupy 
Western framed spaces with Kwakwaka’wakw traditional concepts derived from the Kwak’wala 
language and other cultural forms, perhaps it would demonstrate the possibility that these 
same concepts could continue to survive within the broader space and history of the colonized 
Pacific Northwest Coast.  In this context the visual component of this thesis became 
decolonizing.  It was an indigenous attempt by an Indigenous artist/writer to insert not just 
indigenous forms, which are easily appropriated, into Westernized spaces but indigenous 
ideas and conceptual systems.  In particular I sought to express concepts about the 
relationships of the body, the community and the land and how those relationships are 
reflected in spatial delineation. 
 
 

386 
 
 
8.2 Context: modernism & post-modernism in the arts, form & meaning 
The reflexivity of visual anthropology in its consciousness of contexts or “the frame” can be 
mapped onto a parallel critique of Twentieth Century art history through the rise of post-
modern thought.  Postmodernism began questioning the hierarchy of dominant Western 
discourses during the late 1960s and gained momentum as a critique through the 1970s and 
1980s (Arnason & Prather, 1998; Harrison & Wood, 2003).   Prior to this, modernism was 
invested in ascertaining reality through scientific inquiry and that this reality was to be found 
through physical evidence embodied in the world.   In this sense modernism was related to “
form”.  Its investment was in the world, or a knowable reality.  Modernism covers a broad 
spectrum of thought but to contextualize it for its implications to this thesis I will quote Harrison 
and Wood (2003), that modernism was invested in ascertaining  “one natural ‘reality’ which is 
available to us to explain our beliefs and sensations” (p.1015).  Harrison and Wood also 
describe modernism as having the following associations: 
 
         Modernism refers to the typical forms of a hegemonic culture.  This culture is defined 
as Western in its orientation, capitalist in its determining economic tendency, 
bourgeois in its class-character, white in its racial complexion, and masculine in its 

387 
 
 
dominant gender.  Others of the characteristics of this culture, such as its 
investment of the ‘high’ from the ‘popular’ arts, its tendency to forms of specialization 
and abstruseness, and its individualism, are seen as following from these.  For 
those thus persuaded of the character of Modernism – or persuaded, at least, of the 
inescapable implication of Modernist art in the values of modern culture thus 
characterized – to talk of a postmodern culture or of postmodern forms of art is to 
talk of forms of opposition to hegemony. (p, 1015) 
 
As a reaction to modernism the emergence of postmodernism posited that a single scientific 
understanding of the world was impossible because all understandings of worldly 
phenomenon, i.e. “meaning” were interpreted through particular experience.  The particular 
experiences of cultures “other” than the West, such as First Nations began to be considered 
more centrally and less peripherally.  Postmodernism was less interested in “forms” and more 
invested in the interpretation of forms.   O’Donnell (2003) states, that postmodernism held the 
underlying “belief that all human knowledge is limited and culturally conditioned” (p.6).  Reality 
did not exist in the world “as is” but was shaped by the human mind.   The interpretation of 

388 
 
 
 “meaning” was not fixed but relative to culture and contexts.  This relationship of “form” and 
“meaning” is a familiar argument that runs through the inquiry of this thesis.   “Form”, is what 
exists in the world and “meaning” is how we interpret “form”.   While modernism and 
postmodernism are intrinsically connected as reflections of each other, modernism placed its 
focus on “form” while postmodernism placed its focus on “meaning” in the same way that 
Chomsky’s linguistics from the 1960s could be said to be focused on form or surface 
understructure of “proper form” or “rules for proper form” while cognitive linguistic inquiry from 
the 1970’s onward was focused on deep understructure; the concepts, ideas and belief 
systems that influence surface understucture “rules for proper form” and of course, ultimately 
form itself.  Figure 8.2 demonstrates the relationship of modernism and post-modernism.  Like 
linguistics these intellectual philosophical movements coincided with the belief in a knowable 
reality based on rationality and rules such as universalism and the reactionary push against 
this within societies which demanded recognition of diversity.

               Figure 8.2 Relationship of modernism and post-modernism, form and meaning 
 
The ability of myself as a First Nations artist to place contemporary works within gallery and 
museum spaces is, in part, credited to the reaction of post-modernism against modernism 
which forced these institutions to reconsider the linear, Eurocentric and racist notions of 
superiority which underlay their approach to what was art, how it was defined and who made it. 
 
 
 
MODERNISM (approx.1850s – 1960s)

8.3 The museum and the gallery as an experimental space for decolonization 
Throughout the 20th Century, in First Nations communities, traditional modes for the production 
of art were waning due to cultural oppression and colonization.  The forum for traditional art 
production and exhibition, the potlatch, was outlawed by the Canadian government and 
Kwakwaka’wakw members who participated had become subject to incarceration (Cole & 
Chiakin 1990).  In 1921, William Halliday, the appointed Indian Agent to the Kwakwaka’wakw 
tribes took the unusual step of offering up the physical exchange of potlatch materials for the 
suspension of jail sentences for Kwakwaka’wakw members who were being prosecuted under 
the anti-potlatch law.  For those who gave up their material culture in order to escape jail time 
he collected from them their precious masks, coppers and regalia and placed this material on 
display in the Alert Bay Anglican Church parish hall, charging a small fee for locals to come 
and view.  This was an early, extreme and devastating example of the forced appropriation 
and display of the material culture of the Kwakwaka’wakw.  The objects were then sold and 
shipped to various Museums in the east.   For a more complete history of the partial return of 
this material see “A Strict Law Bids Us Dance”, a film directed by Dennis Wheeler and 
produced by Tom Shandel (1975) in collaboration with U’mista Cultural Society. Figure 8.2 is 
one of the many photos that Halliday took of the confiscated dance masks on display.

The potlatch ban and the appropriation of material culture were conducted under the premise 
of assimilation; that First Nations should give up their traditional culture and become 
Westernized (Cole & Chaikin, 1990).  By appropriating the symbols of the Kwakwaka’wakw 
worldview it was hoped that this worldview could be replaced with those of Western Europe.  

392 
 
 
This included the re-contextualization of those objects/symbols in museums or private 
collections where they would take on new meanings severed from their original function.   
In addition to the suppression of cultural practices and the appropriation of material culture 
Kwakwaka’wakw children were removed from their families and communities and placed in 
residential schools.   It was here that the attempt was made to eradicate the Kwak’wala 
language, another major component of Kwakwaka’wakw cultural worldview, by forcibly 
replacing it with English.   To quote Milloy on the strategies employed by the residential school 
system in order to assimilate indigenous children into European culture (1999): 
 
         A child’s ontology, “the symbolic ordering of the world” through which “actions and 
objects take on meaning”, is ”inherited from [its] parents” and community from the 
moment of birth.  Thus, for example, the child, parent, and community exist in a 
landscape – a culture’s translation of an environment into a “meaning” filled place.  
Parts of the programme of studies would disorient children and then attempt to re-
orient them in a place filled with European “meaning” (p. 37).

Figure 8.4 illustrates how within the residential school system the traditional symbols of 
Kwakwaka’wakw culture were being appropriated into Western canons of artistic/artifact 
display.   It is a 1936 photo taken of artwork done by children at St. Michael’s Residential 
School on display at Pacific National Exhibition.   While their parents and grandparents were 
fighting the government over the imposed illegality of their traditions Kwakwaka’wakw children 
were being encouraged to display those symbols only under conditions completely 
disassociated from their original meanings.   The Pacific National Exhibition had originally 
opened in 1910 as an annual public exhibition and fair meant to showcase the industrial and 
agricultural achievements of British Columbia.  The display of the art of children at the “PNE” 
was meant to symbolize, to the colonial general public, the success of the civilizing process of 
the “indian” under the residential school system.

Figure 8.5 is a photo taken of my uncle Ernest Willie while he was a student at St Michael’s 
Residential School after he had won an award for his artwork.  His traditional Kwakwaka’wakw 
drawing of a whale and thunderbird has the words “TB Thrives on Superstition” written on it; a 
slogan most likely promoted by the school.

The image is telling in that the symbol of crest lineage has been converted by the influence of 
the residential school into a logo that promotes the notion that “tradition” aligned with 
“superstition” is detrimental to First Nations health.   For promoting this message while 

396 
 
 
removing the traditional meaning of the whale and thunderbird image the young boy is 
rewarded.  The “meaning” of the image has deliberately been co-opted and replaced by the 
residential school belief system in order to assimilate young First Nations into Western ways of 
thinking.    
 
In the same way that one can see the traditional artwork by children in St Michael’s Residential 
school and individual drawing of Ernest Willie systematically appropriated by Western 
institutions and conceptual frameworks, vast collections of Kwakwaka’wakw material culture 
were amassed and appropriated by museums and private collectors.  Eurocentric 
categorization defined First Nation’s art as artifact and anthropological subject and placed it 
within “museums”.  It was separated from Western based art which was exhibited in “fine art 
galleries”.  Both types of institutions operated under different modes of viewership and public 
consumption tied into assumed notions of cultural hierarchy linked to Western superiority   
 
By the 1970s, subject to post-modern critique the modern art gallery system began to 
reconsider these relationships and open their doors to First Nations art both traditional and 
contemporary and museums in turn, began to reconsider the nature of their collections and 

397 
 
 
their exhibition.   Symbolic of the times, Diana Nemiroff (1992) states, “As the opening 
sentence of Ruth Phillips’ article, “Indian Art: Where do you put it?” suggests, exhibitions of 
First Nations art have raised a variety of theoretical and practical questions for the dominant 
institutions of the post-colonial West” (p. 16).   
 
Entrance into the fine art gallery systems of the visual arts brought its own dilemma for 
traditional works in that the system exhibited assimilative features rather than maintaining 
traditions.  A mask on display in a setting completely entrenched within Western constructs 
whether that institution was a museum or a gallery was still subject to the curatorial, exhibition 
and viewing lens of the institution.   The “meaning” or signification of the same mask exhibited 
in a museum or a gallery shifted within institutional contexts in the same way that it was shifted 
once removed from its traditional context in a Kwakwaka’wakw community made for 
Kwakwaka’wakw purposes.  Douglas Cole (1985) quotes Virginia R. Dominguez and Lumilla 
Jordinova in the relationship of cultural objects in museums in the following: 
 
Virginia R. Dominguez, in the most trenchant comment on captured heritage, wrote 
that the museums collected less because of the importance of the objects to Indians 

398 
 
 
themselves than because of what they told Europeans about themselves.  
Everything about these ethnological collections – the way they were collected, why 
they were collected, and how they were displayed – points to the process as part of 
the European effort at self-definition. To Ludmilla Jordanova, museum objects are 
trophies of victory, mastery, ownership, control, and dominion (p. x). 
 
Removed from its original ontology, or relationship to traditional understandings the mask as a 
“sign” looked the same but no longer “meant the same thing”.  As signs they had been 
appropriated into Western frames of understanding and value.  Figures 8.6 show the 
Dzunukwa feast dish which was earlier pictured in Figure 3.7 in the context of a potlatch 
display.  In Figure 8.5 the dish is displayed with its apparent owner and several other most 
likely related men and boys.   This image acts as an intermediate document between Figure 
3.7 and Figure 8.6.   This image, taken outside a potlatch setting, still shows a connection to 
the people from whom it originated.  Figure 8.7 shows the dish today in its contemporary 
setting in the Portland Art Museum divorced as an object from both ceremonial context and 
personal connection.

I am showing these images as a way of demonstrating how the dish has changed contexts.   In 
Figures 3.7 and 8.6 the context is still personal and connected to community while in the 
second image it rests under an analytic anonymity within the museum.  In both instances it is 
the same dish (the same signifier) but under these different contexts its meaning has shifted.   
 
 
 

401 
 
 
8.4  The strategy of agency,” to focus on the concept” 
One strategy for dealing with these inherent issues of representation was to attempt to occupy 
museum and gallery spaces with “agency”.  In anthropology the concept of “agency” is most 
often associated with the ability of an individual to create meaning within the frames of the 
communal or society.   Within the context of my own work I identify “agency” within a broader 
framework of the ability of individual communities, or societies, such as the Kwakwaka’wakw to 
self-define within the broader and often overwhelming institutional contexts of the Western 
European gallery and museum.  By this, I mean, not to simply accept inclusion into these 
spaces but to actively engage with modern museum and gallery spaces with a critical 
understanding of their own history and existence as agents of social meaning born of Western 
frameworks.   Rather than accept the overriding narrative of the institution it became an 
imperative to attempt to speak from the position of Kwakwaka’wakw communal understanding 
while highlighting and remaining conscious of the Western “framing” of meaning that would 
occur within the gallery.   With a consciousness of Saussure’s relationship of the “sign” and the 
“signified” in relationship to the traditional art of the Kwakwaka’wakw I deliberately chose 
contemporary art over the traditional in my placement of objects in museum and gallery 
institutions. I self-consciously began to compose specific works which attempted to insert not 

402 
 
 
just Kwakwaka’wakw formal signifiers into public art galleries but Kwakwaka’wakw concepts. 
In the same way that post-modernism shifted the focus away from the formal considerations of 
modernism in order to make more room for interpretation I was attempting to shift the focus 
from the formal considerations of Kwakwaka’wakw material culture collections towards the 
meanings and interpretations of those objects.  I was attempting to re-assert a particularly 
Kwakwaka’wakw connection between formal objects and their meanings by occupying gallery 
and museum public spaces with Kwakwaka’wakw concepts just as much as with objects.   In 
this regard rather than occupy the periphery with a passive acceptance of imposed contexts I 
wanted to create agency and occupy spaces conscientiously while acknowledging the histories 
and contexts of those spaces.  Is it possible for a museum or a gallery space, both major sites 
of public representation to be truly made Kwakwaka’wakw?  I could only attempt this if I had a 
concrete comprehension of the conceptualization of space and its metaphorical associations.  
One strategy was to learn what Kwak’wala had to say about space and having garnered an 
understanding from within the language map that understanding into an actual visual/physical 
engagement with space.  
 

403 
 
 
This brought me back to an engagement with “meaning”.  I knew from personal experience 
that the surface explanation accompanying the Kwakwaka’wakw mask hung on the wall in 
either a gallery space or a museum was a dislocated fragment of what that mask symbolized 
to its makers.  I knew this because I had experienced “the mask” internally within its own 
contexts and histories as a Dzawada’enuxw and Kwikwasuťinuxw member.  I remember 
questioning why it was acceptable to sell the masks and my uncle replying that the value was 
in its “meaning”, its symbolism, not the object itself…that the mask could always be re-made.   
So it seems ironic to me that it was the symbol (or form) that was so prized by the Western 
institutions while its “meaning” was so prized by us.  As, I looked at masks in the UBC 
Museum of Anthropology and in the commercial galleries of downtown Vancouver I felt that 
they had becomes symbols of something else, high-jacked into a different narrative altogether 
and I was not sure I liked what they were saying. Townsend–Gault (1992) reflects on this 
dilemma of signification in the following statement: 
 
         How First Nations artists choose to represent themselves, and how they contest the 
representations of others in a world of cultural disjuncture, fall centrally into what it is 
that the postmodern queries.  There may be little agreement on how to define it and 

404 
 
 
too much generalising social metaphysics, but what is useful is the querying of 
signification, because we need to ask to what extent “meaning” depends on cultural 
difference. (p. 79) 
 
If Kwakwaka’wakw forms had become subject to appropriation within institutional settings was it 
possible to maintain the integrity of original “meanings”?  My experiment would be a reversal of 
the Western institutional trajectory of appropriating forms (signifiers) and changing what they 
signified.  My artwork would attempt to retain the integrity of the meanings (the signified) while 
manipulating the signs (signifiers).  
  
8.5 Entering the gallery space 
In order to explore the complexities of the relationship between “form” and “meaning”, I  
attempted to reverse their priority in the occupation of space within a modern gallery setting.   
Prior attempts at inclusion had placed the formal signifiers of Kwakwaka’wakw culture within 
these gallery and museum spaces with varying results.   My strategy was to place 
Kwakwaka’wakw concepts with some recognizable reference to Kwakwaka’wakw form into 
these spaces but the emphasis would be on the “meanings” rather than the “form”.   These 

405 
 
 
meanings were derived from my research into Kwakwaka’wakw space as expressed through 
the Kwak’wala language.  This act would be consistent with a shift in art historical approaches 
from the 1960s onwards where the focus under consideration in the artistic space had shifted 
from the form to the concept or idea (Morphy & Perkins, 2006) as postmodernism raised its 
critique of modernism.  It would also be consistent with the complementary movement within 
anthropology to consider the significant social aspects of art production as part of the 
emergence of visual anthropology and the converging objectives of art history in addressing 
the gap between ethnological artifact and art.     
 
The resulting artworks did not occupy traditional spaces but, like the contemporary 
Kwakwaka’wakw, seeking to infiltrate and find a place within a tumultuous context of modern 
Western based colonial society, they found expression within the margins of Western 
institutional spaces, the gallery, the museum and the outdoor public.   I say margins, because 
unfortunately the concept of art has been marginalized in modern Western society as somehow 
superfluous.  These spaces were occupied initially with the thought that they are neutral spaces 
where-in which one could create an expression in a supposed blank space; the minimalist 
gallery space of white walls.  However, as is the case with all spaces they are demarcated by 

406 
 
 
their histories of existence; ultimately defined by the Western society which evolved them.  In an 
attempt to keep alive certain philosophies it appeared strategic to enter and occupy both 
academic space (the University) and visual space (public galleries and spaces).  Realistically, 
the traditional spaces of the Kwakwaka’wakw have become so oppressed and marginalized that 
rather than fight to continue to occupy spaces under siege it seemed survivalist to attempt to 
occupy the spaces of the occupier; an attempt at decolonization on two fronts one could say.  
This was done to create dialog, to simply be, to attempt to maintain tradition in adaptive and 
imaginative ways.  I had seen the precedent of this attempt in the creative strategies of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw in the attempting to maintain their potlatch traditions during the early decades 
of the 20th century by mapping potlatch give-aways to the Western notions of Christmas gift 
giving in order to still maintain the traditional obligation of paying witnesses in spite of these 
practices being outlawed (Cole, 1990) or in the creation and raising in 1936 of a memorial pole 
for King George V by the Musgamakw Dzawada’enuxw in Gwa’yi (Kingcome Inlet) which was 
also done to bypass the law against traditional practice.  The will to maintain tradition fueled 
creative thinking, innovation and adaptation in order to facilitate survival.   
 

407 
 
 
The following artworks are an attempt by me, as author/artist to express traditional concepts in 
contemporary ways; to conflate the past with the present and to honor the process of the visual 
and the ritualistic.  These works integrate and seek to ‘embody’ the concepts and ideas of the 
previous 7 chapters of this dissertation.  They were all composed during the period of time that 
the research was being conducted for the written component of this dissertation.  In 2006, 
Baḱwinaťsi – the Container for Souls” was exhibited at the public gallery Artspeak in Gastown, 
Vancouver B.C.   In 2008, The House of the Ghosts” was exhibited at the Vancouver Art 
Gallery.  In 2010, Wanx’id –to hide, to be hidden was exhibited at the U.B.C. Museum of 
Anthropology and in 2012, The Land is a Person was installed as a permanent outdoor artwork 
in North Vancouver, B.C.  
 
8.6 “Baḱwinaťsi – the Container for Souls” 2006 
In Baḱwinaťsi – the Container for Souls, a glass chest was placed in the centre of a white walled 
gallery.  The chest acted as a formal reference to the traditional chest of the Pacific Northwest 
Coast made to house regalia, masks for dance prerogatives, and which sometimes acted as a 
coffin for the body.  These chests were made of cedar and elaborately painted with a 
conventional design that varied in its application. They were utilized up and down the coast 

408 
 
 
most prominently amongst the Heiltsuk of the Bella Bella area and northwards amongst the 
Haida and Tlingit.  Through trade and influence they also became objects of possession 
amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw.  Photos of Kwakwaka’wakw villages taken between 1870-1910 
show the northern stylistic influence of these box designs on house-front applications.  For 
comparison see Figures 8.8 and 8.9.

83 This house was Kwikwasuťinuxw Chief Johnny Scow’s house.  It is the same house pictured in Figure 3.1 but the 
sea monster façade  and whale pole have been replaced with a raven with large extended beak, a prerogative that 
came from Johnny Scow’s second marriage with a Bella Bella woman.  This might account for the northern influence.

The analogy between the box and the house is clearly manifest in this art installation.  The glass 
chest is incised with imagery creating a white on clear effect (Figure 8.10).   Lit from the interior 
by a single light the incised images are cast as shadows onto the four walls of the gallery 
(Figure 8.11).  The box, as representative of the body is visually expanded to create the house 
on the gallery walls.  Viewers are simultaneously inside and outside the chest, inside and 
outside “the house”.

 This artwork visually expresses the metaphor of “the body is a house”.  The glass box is a 
stand in for the body and conscientiously references the traditional use of the chest as a 
container for inherited prerogatives and ancestry.  Referencing the metaphor “the house is a 
‘naḿima”, photographic representations of the author/artist’s mother and aunt adorn the exterior 
sides of the box implicating family connection within the metaphoric “house”.  The biological 
body is derived from the genealogical “house”.  As a further reference to the idea of the body 
are the incised images of owls on each end of the chest which are a Kwakwaka’wakw referent 
to mortality and the belief that the soul, once it left the body after death would enter the body of 
an owl for a period of transition before entering the spirit world.   In this work the soul is equated 
with the ephemeral while the box is equated with the body.  The body is equated with the 
material culture of the Kwakwaka’wakw while the soul is equated with the more ephemeral 
notions of cultural beliefs and worldview.   By analogy, the ephemeral beliefs and cultural under-
structure of the Kwakwaka’wakw are the soul of the people while the manifestations of material 
culture are their body.  
 
By extension the work also engages with analogical relationships between objects and contexts.  
The chest represents the body, but also the objects of the Kwakwaka’wakw which have been 

414 
 
 
objectified as decoration, curio, or trophy within Western frameworks.  The original installation 
was exhibited in Artspeak Gallery in Vancouver’s Gastown, home to some of the most 
prestigious Northwest Coast commercial galleries.  The work sought to draw the analogy 
between Kwakwaka’wakw material culture, peddled and proliferated and valued under Western 
economic constructs and Kwakwaka’wakw intangible culture; the Kwakwaka’wakw worldview as 
expressed in the concepts and ideas embedded in an endangered Kwak’wala.  “Baḱwinaťsi – 
the Container for Souls” sought to reconfigure a balance between the object/chest (materiality) 
with the subjective/shadows (immaterial); a balance more akin to Kwakwaka’wakw traditions 
and belief systems which has become skewed in contemporary times by the imposed and 
inescapable economic value systems of the West which tend to revere the object and the 
material.      
 
The work operates as a symbol in a space representing a body and a house.  It is also literal, in 
that the viewer’s body becomes part of the artwork and occupies the gallery space in a 
heightened state of self-consciousness.  The traditional Western experience of viewer observing 
an artwork is disrupted and the viewer becomes both the observer and the observed.  The 
experience parallels the embodiment that Lakoff and Johnson (1999) subscribe to in cognitive 

415 
 
 
linguistics.  The construct of an objective and independent ‘reason’ (mind) is removed by the 
physical participation and engagement of the viewer.  This embodiment in artistic practice is 
more closely aligned with traditional Kwakwaka’wakw artistic experience in the ceremonial 
house/village/world than the constructed viewer/object relationship of the Western gallery. 
   
 By placing the physical bodies of the viewers inside the work, Baḱwinaťsi – the Container for 
Souls”  mimics the performance based spatial engagement of Kwakwaka’wakw rituals.  By 
creating physically engaged works, the visual objectification of the fetishized cultural object 
would be disrupted and thus make room for Kwakwaka’wakw intent.  Figure 8.12 presents some 
of the analogies utilised in this artwork.

8.7 “The House of the Ghosts” 2008 
In 2007, I was approached by the Vancouver Art Gallery to compose a site specific work for the 
exterior of the Gallery.  Using a banner and light projection I transformed the Georgia Street 
gallery façade into the interior of a Kwakwaka’wakw ceremonial house in a performance that 
spanned the traditional winter ceremonial season from October 2008 to January 2009.  My initial 
thought was to consider the Robson Street side but upon further consideration I deemed the 
Georgia street side more appropriate because it faced the water and as far as referencing 
houses went my linguistic research was indicating this to be an orientation of significance.  The 
installation was a conscientious address of the temporal shift between night and day and the 
symbolic treatments of the spatial interior and exterior architecture of a Kwakwaka’wakw house.   
In particular, this work utilized concepts of analogical spatial expansion and contraction, the 
metaphor “house=world”, the primary orientation of ťłas- “seaward” / atł- “towards the woods”, 
and the concept embodied in the word ‘nala- as both “the day and the world” 
 
The art addressed the history of Kwakwaka’wakw cultural oppression through the official 
potlatch ban instituted by the Canadian government from1885, until the ban was dropped 
in1951 (Cole & Chaikin, 1990). The Vancouver Art Gallery building was originally built in 1906 

417 
 
 
as the B.C. Provincial Courthouse.  As such, it was a symbol placed upon the landscape that 
announced the legal authority of the new province of British Columbia; a province in league with 
the Federal government in actively promoting the suppression and demise of Kwakwaka’wakw 
traditional culture in an effort to assimilate the “Indians” and appropriate their lands.   In 1921, 
many Kwakwaka’wakw were given jail sentences for potlatching (Cole & Chaikin, 1990).  The 
courthouse building eventually became the home of the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1983 and has 
been Vancouver’s most popular site of social protest since.  In 2001, artist Ken Lum installed a 
permanent artwork of four boats, one on each corner of the building roof.  On the Georgia street 
side is installed a white ‘trade’ ship, such as those which first brought non-indigenous people to 
the coast, and a red Aboriginal style canoe84. Taking these visual icons resting on top of what 
used to be the Provincial Courthouse, into consideration as markers of the historical events of 
Western European contact, the potlatch ban, and of the cultural difference in approach to the 
landscape (or stage) of British Columbia the artwork was conceived . 
 
A banner was hung across the exterior façade visually referencing a ma’wił  “dance screen”.   
These were traditionally mounted in the Kwakwaka’wakw house between the two back (upriver

associated) posts during ceremonial performances (see Figure 5.5).  In Figure 8.13 a dance 
screen is stretched between the two rear houseposts during a dance performance of the 
Atłaḱama “dance of the woods”, at Gwayasdams Village (Gilford Island) in 1946.   These 
screens were not always there but would be hung for ceremonial purposes.  To see the rear of 
the same house without the screen see Figure 5.6.  In this photo the dancers are assembled in 
front of the screen for the sake of the photograph.  They wouldn’t normally be seen this way.

The screen made for the Vancouver Art Gallery was visually divided into red and grey sections 
mimicking the divisions of the national flag of Canada.  This tied in well with the colors of the 
white ship and red canoe, amplifying their symbolism as icons of coastal First Nations and 
colonists.  In the centre portion of the image a ghost puppet was portrayed straddling a red 
cedar ring through which a skull emerges.  An owl occupied the stomach portion of the ghost 
puppet.  In the image the hands of the ghost form the owl’s wings.   The ghost is referred to as a 

420 
 
 
puppet because it is associated with the ťukwid  performance of puppets in the ceremonies of 
the Kwakwaka’wakw where they would rise out of the ground.  It is referenced in this installation 
as having “the supernatural ability to arise from the dead or come to life.” Figures 8.14 and 
Figure 8.15 show the daytime ceremonial curtain in place at the Vancouver Art Gallery. Figure 
8.16 shows a puppet called nułamgila “foolmaker” collected from Gwa’yi Village (Kingcome 
Inlet) from Peter Moon.  In an older collection of puppets in the American Museum of Natural 
History collected by George Hunt for Franz Boas from Kingcome Inlet a large ghost puppet has 
as her two children two nułamgila.   The reference to the “foolmaker” I use in a contemporary 
context as a Kwakwaka’wakw perspective on modern Western short-term exploitative 
approaches to the land. 
 
Upon the red colored fields are two printed texts; one in Kwak’wala, the other, the English 
translation.   These read as: 
 
Giga, LiloἸinuxw!  Suma’as ganutłida ‘nala dłuwi’ ‘nalida ganutłi’, laxgada ‘Wala Gukw. 
Wosida gaxa’nuxw, Ha’yałiligas kas wa’xidage’os ka `kwaligalitłe’sa naxwa!

The text is highly metaphorical.  In the text the “ghosts” are “ancestors and spirits”, the “Great 
House” is “the world, the earth”, and the “great healer” is reference to the killer whales who are 
referred to as Ha’yałiligas which literally translates as “Healing Woman” or “Woman-Setting-
Right”, an honorific often used in prayers for healing.  Boas (1932) states, “Ha’yałiligas is a term 
used to designate ghosts as well as all beneficent supernatural beings” (p.210).  The reference 
to day and night comes from the Kwakwaka’wakw belief that the ghosts (spirits), comes closer 

424 
 
 
to the physical world at night and in winter.  This makes perfect sense in the Pacific Northwest 
Coast geography, where in summer the day stretches until 10pm in June and only 4pm in 
December, if we remember that the winter is aligned with night and the spiritual, while day is 
aligned with summer and the body.   In the work the following temporal metaphors are used: 
 
                                 A day and a night is a summer and a winter 
                   Summer and winter are symbolic of the body and the spirit/soul 
 
The text expands the temporal timeframe of a day into the timeframe of a year by drawing the 
analogy that day=summer and night=winter.  It also expresses the concepts described in 
chapter 7 where a day is analogous to the world as the temporal stage where events occur, “in 
this Great House”.  The Kwakwaka’wakw world is one of opposites which require balance.  The 
ghosts are the spiritual equivalent to humanity and in many ways human prosperity is reliant on 
their good grace.  The world is divided into day and night, summer and winter, spirits and 
humans.  They are intrinsically connected but opposite.  Together they make a whole.  This is 
the metaphorical explanation as to why, in the land of the ghosts, day is night and night is day.  

425 
 
 
In Boas (1935) it is stated, “Everything in the ghost village is the same as in our world, only their 
day is our night , our night their day (p.131).”  Figure 8.16 shows these analogous relationships.

The text printed on the daytime banner is a prayer for assistance in this world with dealing with 
the ill health of the planet and the imbalance of the contemporary capitalist based disassociation 
of humans from the land (exploitive rather than empathetic) as explained in chapter 6.  It points 
to the Kwakwaka’wakw concept of balance between the physical world (human body) and 
‘nala  “the day”  the temporal stage where events occur

spiritual health.  Spiritual health is marked by the concept of respect and acknowledgment of all 
life forms as animate and equivalent to humanity.   “We are the land and the land is us, if we 
mistreat it, we will suffer.” 
 
In “The House of the Ghosts” art installation, as evening fell, a light projection gradually 
transformed the red printed texts areas into the images of killer whales and the Vancouver Art 
Gallery architectural posts and lintel, which framed the banner (dance screen), were 
transformed into carved houseposts and crossbeam.   The crossbeam image was a sisi’utł, the 
double headed serpent, which represents balance. The housepost images were wolves (the 
land equivalent of the killer-whales) overtop of killer whales both considered to have the ability 
to heal humans.  These beings are considered the chiefs of the land and the sea.  The wolves 
are sometimes called atła’nam “wolf”, literally, “one from the forest” or atłu’linuxw “wolf” (Boas 
1948, p.18).   Note the use of the atł- stem.  While I could not find an equivalent ťłas- name form 
for whales meaning specifically meaning “one from the sea” I did find that whale names are 
often derived from the stem ťłas- “seaward, region of the sea”.  For example, `Tłalis means 
“whale blowing on beach”, or `Tłalis kasu  “the real whale blowing on beach and `Tłaliłi’lakw 
“(whale) blowing in house” (Boas, 1925? unpublished manuscript “Personal Names in Kwakiutl”, 

427 
 
 
p. 118).  The whale and wolf posts represent the relationship of the land and sea regions.  As 
houseposts they symbolically hold up the “house of the world”.   Figure 8.18 shows “The House 
of the Ghosts” at night.

8.7.1  Spatial transformation: From outside to inside, exterior to interior 
The light projection symbolically transformed the architectural exterior of the Vancouver Art 
Gallery into the interior posts and lintel of a Kwakwaka’wakw bighouse.  In doing this the 
‘outside’ space of the viewer became the interior ceremonial floor of the house, the night sky 
becoming the ceiling etc.  The viewer, by standing within the symbolic ceremonial space while 
viewing the work, was now implicated in a ritual performance.  Viewers then become a part of 
the work and as such are addressed as a participant in the condition of the world which is 
questioned by the words on the banner. Figure 8.19 diagrams this spatial relationship.

In The House of the Ghost’s temporal performance, what is in the daytime, the exterior of the 
Vancouver Art Gallery becomes the interior of up-river side of the Kwakwaka’wakw ceremonial 
house at night.  During the day the Vancouver Art Gallery is a house with a declaratory banner.  
At night the façade is now the rear part of a ceremonial Kwakwaka’wakw house.  The world has 
become a house and the viewers who stand within the symbolic ceremonial floor are the

performers.  The witnesses to this ceremony, this potlatch, are the people who walk or drive by 
over the course of the installation.    
 
This work had a visual precedent embedded in the history of radical culture change symbolized 
by architectural shift at the turn of the last century.   Figure 8.20 is a photo of houseposts in Alert 
Bay taken in 1914.   In this image we are looking at the interior houseposts of the traditional 
bighouse which formerly occupied this space.  The modern Western European style house has 
been built in the same spatial location where the upriver, chief’s quarters would have been if the 
exterior of the communal house was still present.  Encouraged by the onslaught of Western 
based norms the “community” houses were eventually abandoned and replaced by modern 
“individual” family dwellings.  In this case, the original interior houseposts become the exterior 
model of the now iconic “totem pole” of the Pacific Northwest Coast.   In an interesting and 
somewhat tragic aside, from the point of view of the Kwakwaka’wakw, these same poles 
eventually were installed as decorative features around the entryway of the St. Michaels 
Residential School, which had been opened in 1929 (see Figure 8.21).

The houseposts originally belonged to Chief `Tłakwudłas of the ‘Namgis Tribe.  The house was never finished.  The

8.7.2 Temporal and spatial analogies 
The contemporary artwork “The House of the Ghosts”, utilized temporal and spatial metaphors 
and analogies.   The symbolism of day and night, interior and exterior are grounded in traditional 

434 
 
 
concepts and used to reflect on contemporary conditions in the light of Kwakwaka’wakw and 
colonial history.  Both “the world is a house” metaphor, in its approach to architecture, as well as 
the metaphor “the house is a body” in its references to sickness and healing, as well as “the 
world is a body” are manifest in its  formal execution.  Strategically the house orientation of ťłas- 
“seaward” is also used in relationship to its position within the cityscape of downtown Vancouver 
“facing the water”.  The Kwakwaka’wakw ceremonial space is heightened in the winter when 
village becomes a sacred site where spirits and ghosts come close and the past is brought 
forward to meet the present86.  
 
To reiterate, the Kwakwaka’wakw traditionally divided the year into two primary divisions, the 
summer and the winter.  The summer season was aligned with the physical, the body, gathering 
provisions and being out on the land.  This season was considered baxus  “the profane or 
ordinary”.  The winter season was its opposite.  The winter was aligned with the spiritual, the 
soul, ritual enactments (the winter ceremonial), feasting, gathering of ‘naḿima and tribes in a 
central location.  It was considered nawalakw “supernatural”.  The division and difference 
between these seasons were so pronounced that the membership held two names, one for the 
                                                 
86 This symbolism has been alluded to throughout this dissertation and is more fully explained in Nicolson 
(2005).    

435 
 
 
summer season and one for the winter season. The installation takes place in the winter and 
plays with the temporal notions of day and night as a contraction of the summer and  winter 
seasons.  It is at night and in winter that the Vancouver Art Gallery is transformed into “the 
house of the ghosts” through symbolism and architectural reference in an expression of dismay 
over present concerns over the state of the land/world, of British Columbia and its history of 
cultural oppression of Indigenous bodies and ideas. 
 
8.8 “’Wanx’id – to hide, to be hidden”  2010 
The artwork “’Wanx’id – to hide, to be hidden” plays with the notion of exterior and interior 
knowledge which is aligned with form and meaning, material culture and cultural 
conceptualization or ontology.   It visually aligns the idea of the body, the box, the house, the 
village and the land.   Eight glass chests mimic in dimension and form eight wooden 
boxes/chests on exhibit in the UBC Museum of Anthropology’s main hall (see Figures 3.9 and 
3.10).  This interior installation was made for the UBC Museum of Anthropology and reflects on 
the institutional practices of museum collections and display from an Indigenous perspective. 
 

436 
 
 
Each chest is blackened from the outside and incised with form-line imagery on their interior 
surfaces.  The blackened exteriors block the viewer from the visual expectation set up by the 
main exhibition hall and open storage displays where everything is well lit and visually 
accessible.   It isn’t until the viewer comes close that the interior imagery starts to emerge from 
inside the box compelling the viewer to stand over the boxes to look inside.  The boxes are lit 
from below and transparent images taken in the 1930’s in Gwa’yi (Kingcome Inlet) are found on 
the bottom.  Figure 8.22 shows the installation of eight boxes.  Figure 8.23 gives a closer 
perspective where one can begin to see the carved box interiors.   
 
The inset photographic images refer to a particular time period in Musgamakw Dzawada’enuxw 
history.  It was in the 1930’s that the day school in Kingcome Inlet was shut down in favor of 
sending the village children to the newly built St Michael’s Residential School which had opened 
in Alert Bay in 1929.  This act in particular, which was enforced by the Indian Agent, dealt a 
severe blow to the passing on of language and culture by separating children from their parents.  
The images in each of the boxes are divided into portraits and landscapes.  Figure 8.24 shows 
the interior photo of a class of young girls posing with their teacher prior to closing of the day 
school in Kingcome Inlet.   Some of these young girls I knew as elderly women in the 1990’s 

437 
 
 
when the push was on to record and gather as much oral history as possible before these 
elders were no longer with us.

The title of the work “’Wanx’id – to hide, to be hidden” has a double meaning.  On one hand, it 
refers to the deliberate masking or withholding of Indigenous cultural information from the 
consumption of the public but on the other hand it refers to the cultural distance and confusion 
created between different generations of the Kwakwaka’wakw by the potlatch ban and the 
residential school system.  It was this systemic oppression that deliberately disrupted and

441 
 
 
“made hidden” cultural understanding between the Kwakwaka’wakw who experienced this and 
their children. 
 
The work also considers the irony in that current generations (such as myself) are now tasked 
with researching the vast collections of information and material culture that had been removed 
from the communities and placed in museums and archives in order to return it to the 
community physically and conceptually.   The people pictured in the images inside the boxes 
were in a sense a storehouse of cultural information themselves and the portraits emphasized 
the fact that as a living culture this information existed within human beings and within their 
interactions and understandings amongst each other rather than as materials in a museum or 
archive. 
    
The exterior view of the boxes mimicked the architecture of a village or cluster of buildings.  This 
reference is simultaneously to both the village community and contemporary institutions.  The 
use of glass is a particular reference to this.  The UBC Museum of Anthropology is a building 
made of glass that contains the material culture of the Kwakwaka’wakw, which are exhibited 
behind glass.   Figure 8.26 shows The UBC Museum of Anthropology from the side facing the 

442 
 
 
water.  Based on the post and beam structure of a bighouse the Museum actually faces the 
water of Burrard Inlet.  Most people don’t realize it but according to Kwakwaka’wakw geography 
they are entering from the back of the house since this is where the main entrance is situated.

Figure 8.27 shows masks on display inside the UBC Museum of Anthropology.   Traditionally 
these masks would never have been shown except in a ceremonial context.  As sacred objects 
they would be kept hidden in chests until it was time to show them briefly in the ceremonial 

443 
 
 
house. ‘Wanx’id – to hide, to be hidden” also refers to this radical divergence in the display of 
masks between internal community display and public displays in museums and other 
institutions such as commercial galleries.

The form of the boxes most obvious reference is to the traditional cedar container which would 
hold foodstuffs and długwe “treasures”, masks and regalia, the symbols of lineage rights and 
histories.  An analogy is drawn between the ideas of continuity in lineage, cultural property and 
inheritance.   Some of the images are of the land and village (Figure 8.28).  Other images are of 
the Chiefs from the late 1930s time-period (Figure 8.29).

The people, the village and the landscape and the epistemology, or worldview, they create are 
the długwe contained within the boxes.  These “treasures” are the less tangible aspects of 
Kwakwaka’wakw culture which have been separated from their “material culture” counterparts in 
museum institutions.   However, the material culture is merely derived from the intangible

culture.  The masks and poles and regalia are the surface, formal expression of what is 
considered in traditional Kwakwaka’wakw thought as most important; the ideas and concepts 
and lineages which they represent.  So in contemporary times through museums one 
experiences a reversed engagement.  Institutions have inherited a legacy of preserving the 
objects of cultures while the conceptual source from which these objects emerged was largely 
ignored and misunderstood. It has become the challenge of these institutions to redress this 
imbalanced approach. 
 
The blackened exteriors of the boxes disrupt the expectation of the viewer who has become 
accustomed to having free visual access to symbols of Indigenous culture.  The format of the 
boxes forces a physical engagement again mimicking the performance aspect of 
Kwakwaka’wakw cultural traditions which engage the body in space.  Figure 8.32 shows my 
nephew, Ryan Nicolson, and my mother, Gloria Nicolson, looking inside the boxes.   This image 
is symbolic of how I perceive myself as a Kwakwaka’wakw artist and author anchored and 
accountable to both the generation who comes after me and the generation before me.

The title “’Wanx’id – to Hide, to be Hidden” hints at the idea of the ephemeral and the intangible, 
notions of access and inaccessibility.  It plays with the notion of interior knowledge and 
contained spaces which are known only to those who truly occupy them.  In a nod at current 
conditions it also acknowledges the dilemma of contemporary Kwakwaka’wakw to understand 
and know a culture that they have inherited under duress and disassociated from its origins 
through colonialism.   The work addresses the awkward reality that many Indigenous 
communities are now reliant on information and collections documented by the societies which 

450 
 
 
caused their traditional cultural educations to be broken down.   In a way it is a self-reflection on 
my own survivalist strategy to re-cover and revive Kwakwaka’wakw culture by infiltrating the 
academy, the galleries and the museums.  The work is a visual analogy of my own process of 
entering archives, sourcing material, cross referencing information, analyzing linguistic forms, 
reconstructing historical narratives, staring at photographs, listening to the people around me, 
witnessing and participating in ceremonies, walking on the land and hoping to understand.  In a 
sense the work reflects on the process inherent in compiling both this thesis and the motives 
and issues behind that act.  Taiaiake Alfred (2010) states in regard to this artwork: 
 
         Our art is our life, and to me the power of Marianne Nicolson’s work is not on display 
in drawn designs or shaped forms.  What makes her an artist in my mind is her 
conscious engagement with the elements of her people’s culture and their 
homeland.  The pieces of wood, the paint on rocks, the arrangements of light all 
form a constant chronicle of her continuing journey as a person striving to be a true 
human being.  The works are affective and beautiful.  But her art and that of any 
artist is her journey and how she makes us think and feel about our own lives.  In 
this sense her work is a powerful teaching to those of us who are struggling to find 

451 
 
 
ways to regenerate ourselves and to re-establish our presence in these homelands 
of ours, now called Canada. (UBC MOA Borderzones website, 
http://www.moa.ubc.ca/borderzones/features_nicolson.html) 
 
My feeling is that Alfred understands at a fundamental level what I am trying to express; the 
ideas, experiences, an often elusive comprehension of life which are framed by a specific 
culture.   These ephemeral elements are linked by physical acts which create physical objects 
but ultimately the motivation is conceptual.  In ‘Wanx’id –to hide, to be hidden”  I have returned 
once more to the relationships of form and meaning, the physical and spiritual and the metaphor 
of the body=house=land in a work which also challenges representation and the social politics 
of Indigenous relationships to the colonial spaces of the museum and the gallery. 
 
8.9 “The Land is a Person” 2012 
“The Land is a Person”, is the last work in the series of four which are presented as the visual 
component of this thesis.  This work in particular provides the most literal manifestation of the 
metaphor, body=house=land as evidenced by the title.   I was approached by the developer of a 
retirement home to propose a permanent site-specific installation along Mt. Seymour Parkway in 

452 
 
 
North Vancouver B.C.  Utilising the Kwakwaka’wakw temporal concepts of value and emphasis 
placed upon the past and the connection to ancient beginnings I proposed an artwork that would 
complement its physical and social environment.  A 22’ high hat made of steel, glass and wood 
is now permanently installed upon the landscape near North Vancouver’s Mount Seymour.  The 
form of the hat mimics a mountain. During the day it is the form that dominates the work.  The 
material qualities of steel, glass, wood and concrete are tangible, solid and complementary.   At 
night the work is transformed by light, the etched image of a killer whale emerging in the dark. 
Like “The House of the Ghosts” this work exploits the alternation of day and night, the physical 
and the ephemeral.  Figure 8.33 shows the artwork in daytime.  Figure 8.34 shows the work at 
night.

The hat is worn by the landscape.  The “hat on the land” is literal.  It acts to personify and 
animate the land as equivalent to the human body.  The body of the land is the vertical depth of 
layer upon layer of material built up over thousands of years.  It honors a sense of agedness in 
“place”.  Figure 8.35 shows a traditional hat made of cedar bark or spruce-root worn by the man 
on the right holding staffs covered in silver bracelets for a potlatch give-away.   Note the stack of 
hats in the background that visually mimic the stack of blankets behind the men.  These can be 
metaphorically referred to as “mountains of wealth”.  Boas (1949) states: “The large amount of 
property given away “stands a mountain of blankets, reaching through the world.” (p. 234).   
Referring back to chapter 6, in the words of Daband, ancestor to the Wa’ukwamayi ‘naḿima of 
the Dzawada’enuxw, when he came out of the stone as a human being to become a tribesman 
of Kawadilikala: “My name is Stone, my name is Mountain, my name is Big Mountain, my name 
is increasing Mountain.” (Curtis 1915:133)  These examples show an empathetic and animated 
perspective of the land.   The land is both personified and like a chief, a source of wealth.   
However, the interpretation of what wealth (value) is, and its means of distribution are radically 
different from Western capitalist concepts.

In Dzawada’enuxw history the mountain births a man who becomes the ancestor of the 
Dzawada’enuxw.  His biology, the biology of the mountain becomes a part of the people.  When 
the people die, their physical bodies return to the land/mountain.   The mountain acts as a 
symbol of the land and is considered as equivalent to humanity.  As demonstrated throughout 
this thesis through language and cultural practices the Kwakwaka’wakw perspective of their 
relationship with the land is both material and spiritual.  This is in contrast to a contemporary 
Western based, capitalist economic and philosophical approach to the land which is transitory, 
fleeting and focused on the material.   
 
The Land is a Person, was inspired by the legislation of “Pachamama” from Bolivia, in South 
America, where the land has recently been recognized by law, with rights equivalent to human 
rights (Vidal, 2011). I saw this belief as akin to the Kwakwaka’wakw traditional approach to the 
land where the land is considered animate and alive, deserving of respect and a status equal to 
that of humans.  In addition, after thousands of years of occupying the same landscape, the 
land is literally imbued with the remains of one’s ancestral biology. This is ideologically 
contrasted against the current status within North American legal definitions of United States 
commercial corporations as “persons”, or citizens (Hall, 2010).  The hat built on the land in 

458 
 
 
North Vancouver is a visual affirmation of the Indigenous perspective of the land and the 
approach to the landscape as a partner to humanity rather than subservient.  
 
Again, the killer whale is a referent for healing of the body/land that we saw expressed in The 
House of the Ghosts.   The use of the color blue refers to the sea and to the sky.  The visual 
transition from day to night is a reference to the idea of the body (day) and the spirit (night) and 
the idea of balance between both which was elaborated upon in the section describing “The 
House of the Ghosts”. One aspect of this work that is less prevalent amongst the others is its 
literality.  The work literally engages with the land; is placed upon the land.  The analogy of the 
body with the land is made explicit in the occupation of the space by viewers.  When in the 
space the hat crowns both individuals present in the space and simultaneously continues to 
crown the land. The hat also acts like a house in that it provides shelter for the human body. 
This manifests the metaphor Body=House=Land/World and the concept “you are the land”, 
amplifying the empathetic character of Kwakwaka’wakw land/human relationships.

8.10 Summary 
Each of the four works described attempts to express, under contemporary conditions, 
metaphorical and analogical concepts that arise from a Kwakwaka’wakw traditional approach to 
space and time. These concepts have been derived from language forms and ‘ways of 
speaking’ that emerge from the Kwak’wala language.   One might ask the question, “Why 
contemporary works and not a more comprehensive analysis of traditional ceremonialism and 
artistic expression?”   The answer to that lies in the purpose of the analysis itself. If the premise 
of this dissertation was to further explain Kwakwaka’wakw culture to an outside audience as an 
individual pursuit by a student within the academic setting then the logical follow through might 
have been that type of explanation.  However, I approached this endeavor as a survivalist 
strategy to learn about the Kwak’wala language and to consider its relevance to contemporary 
Kwakwaka’wakw.   In contemporary contexts the perusal and exploration of the formal aspects 
of Kwakwaka’wakw culture have been examined on many fronts and will continue to be, given 
the curiosity of the broader society.  However, it has been my own concern as a contemporary 
Kwakwaka’wakw person, to explore the underlying notions, conceptual associations and the 
‘ways of thinking’ that originally brought forth those creations.  While we might imitate what has 
gone on before, how much do we understand and think like our ancestors given our current 

460 
 
 
colonized state of living in a Western styled society while speaking English?  The true test it 
seemed was to create works that while innovative in material and context would address these 
new materials and contexts in a way that had conceptual consistency with that found in the 
Kwak’wala language and traditional expressions.  To paraphrase, it was akin to approaching the 
issues at hand while thinking like our ancestors.  If our ancestors had access to the materials 
and spaces that I had access to what would they create and would those creations reflect 
concepts and ideas that had spatial and temporal familiarity?   
 
It is easy to imitate forms without fundamental understanding but impossible to innovate without 
fundamental conceptual understanding.  Of course, in the long run it cannot avoid becoming a 
hybrid practice but one I thought worthwhile pursuing over the option of placing what appeared 
as traditional works in non-traditional settings (galleries and museums) where the works have 
the appearance of visual consistency with their past but through re-contextualization have 
become more about Western colonial culture than Kwakwaka’wakw culture.    Again, like this 
dissertation, it is simply a strategy engaged in by the author/artist because the traditional 
channels of cultural transmission were actively supressed and appropriated years ago.   The 
discussion becomes one of form and meaning and the attempt to engage with the meanings 

461 
 
 
and apply the forms rather than just engage with the forms alone.  In this sense the work is an 
extension of the postmodern critique of a single narrative or knowable reality.  These works 
contest the narrow singular understanding of their formal elements previously focused upon in 
the gallery and museum exhibitions of indigenous works that emerged out of modernism in the 
first half of the 20th century by attempting to speak from within their own understandings rather 
than an imposed one.  In a sense the artworks attempt to appropriate the Western construct of 
the exhibition space into one which is intrinsically Kwakwaka’wakw in its meaning in addition to 
its form.  As postmodernism has attempted to make room for additional narratives and voices so 
then do these works take the opportunity to express Kwakwaka’wakw ideas in alternative 
spaces and in doing so, perpetuate the traditions of the Kwakwaka’wakw in new and innovative 
ways.

Dream of Alakilayogwa 
I dreamed I travelled across the water in a small canoe.  I was not half way across 
when a northwesterly gale began to blow.  I steered towards Naxagad.  Then my 
small travelling canoe capsized.  I climbed out of the small canoe that was drifting 
upside down on the water.  I lay on it with my chest down.  Then a gull came flying 
and alighted on the bow of small canoe that was drifting on the water.  It took my 
hand and told me to walk on top of the water.  Thus I arrived at Blunden Harbour.  
Then he taught me what to do when a great epidemic should come in summer.  He 
said so, and spit out a quartz crystal.  Then he put the quartz crystal into my body at 
the lower end of my sternum and pressed it in.  Then he said, “Now make a rattle in 
my form (imitate me).  Then you will be a great shaman,” thus said the gull.  “Now 
you shall have the name `Ku’lanťsisamega from now on.”  Then I awoke. (Boas, 
1925, pp. 27-29)

9.1 General Overview 
Through the exploration of the concept of space, the written component of my thesis has 
demonstrated that the Kwak’wala language and traditional cultural forms are mutually 
supportive.  Language and culture reflect each other because they derive from the same 
conceptual source or understructure (worldview) that was developed over thousands of years in 
the same landscape.   Reflected throughout the Kwak’wala language and traditional 
Kwakwaka’wakw cultural forms such as architecture, social structure, ceremonies and narrative 
is the primary metaphoric concept Body=House=Land/World.   This empathetic analogous 
relationship is influential in the formal linguistic manifestation of the u-[a’w-] stem, the spatial 
division of Kwak’wala pronouns and certain required aspects of the determiner system, in 
particular, the radial categorization of the stem ga- “referring to someone/something in closest 
proximity to the point of origin” and he- “further away, or removed altogether, distant, (off-
stage)”.  Relationships of the body are mapped onto the architecture of the house in terms such 
as ugwiwalil  “front of house, forehead of house, rear of house”. Terminology referential to the 
house, such as ‘naldzi’  “upriver” and gwe’nakw “downriver” are analogous to social structure 
which is also reflected in village and land occupation.  All of these are mapped onto orientations 
within the landscape which are marked by the stems atł- “landwards, forest region”, ťłas- 

464 
 
 
“seaward, ocean/water region”, ‘nal-[‘nal-] “upriver” and gwa- “downriver”.  These four primary 
geographical orientations are anchored by the u-[a’w-] stem which is associated with the body, 
or site of origin. 
 
Analogical spatial expansion and contraction is used as a method for the conceptualization of 
geographic and temporal relationships.  The beliefs “the house is an expanded body”, and “the 
world is an expanded house”, are examples of analogical expansion.  The belief, “the 
ceremonial house is the world” is an example of analogical contraction.  It is particularly 
through the stem ga- “referring to someone/something in closest proximity to the point of 
origin” that temporal expansion and contraction are exhibited.  Ga- can encompass the 
meaning “closest to the body as occurring now in time and space” but also “closest to origins 
in time and space historically. 
 
Concepts of time appear to share conceptual features with space exhibiting time/space 
crossover.  This is most evident in the stem ‘na- “the day, or the world”.  The day is the 
temporal time frame when events occur, while the world is the stage or space where events 
occur.   The year is divided into two primary seasons which are heavily symbolic of social 

465 
 
 
relationships in space.  The winter village and the winter season are composed of close 
relationships both physical and spiritual in that ‘ni’naḿima “clans” come together to winter in a 
single location with spirits for the ťsiťseka “winter ceremonial”.   When together in the 
ceremonial house, the ‘ni‘naḿima are spatially positioned in relationship to one another in a 
reflection of social standings. In the summer, the ni’naḿima “clans” spatially spread out over 
the land for resource based activities.  Again, within this movement one can see the concept of 
expansion and contraction operating. One could say that the social “body” of the tribe is 
brought together in the winter and spread out over the land in the summer.  In the winter, the 
ceremonial house becomes a microcosm of the universe where temporal and spatial 
relationships are imaginatively and symbolically reconfigured.  Figure 9.1 demonstrates the 
relationship of Kwak’wala forms to understructure.  The understructure can be said to form a 
grammar  that is connected to extended meanings (semantics) which form the ontology of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw.  Radial categories are part of the relationship between the grammar and the 
ontology.

                 Figure 9.1 Relationship of surface forms and understructures in Kwak’wala 
 
The underlying systems which are represented by radial extensions, conceptual associations, 
and beliefs ultimately influence the manifestation of “surface forms” both linguistic and of 
cultural practice.  Surface form and deep meaning are mutually enforcing.   Kwakwaka’wakw 
cultural forms stem from the same conceptual substructure91 that Kwak’wala language forms 
                                                 
91 The words “substructure” and “understructure” are interchangeable; both referring to the base or 
foundation of an entity.  I have used the term “understructure” more often due to its literal expression of 
spatial relationship.

emerge out of.  This deeper substructure can also be called worldview.  This worldview has 
developed over thousands of years within the same geographic environment and is indeed, 
deeply connected to the particular landscape of Pacific Northwest coast land, sea and the 
intermediate village zone situated in between.  Figure 9.2 diagrams the relationship with cultural 
forms.

This relationship is a result of relative stability over time and space.  In other words it developed 
and maintained itself over an extended period of time within a defined geography.   One of the 
pivotal questions underlying this thesis regards the effects of radical colonization where 
Kwakwaka’wakw culture and language were forcibly suppressed in order to replace traditional 
ontologies (worldview and belief systems) with Western ontologies throughout the latter part of 
the 19th century through to the 20th century.  Kwak’wala speech was actively discouraged and 
young Kwakwaka’wakw were encouraged to abandon “old ways of thinking” through an 
imposed residential school system.  The potlatch was outlawed and participants were 
incarcerated.   Massive amounts of material culture were appropriated and interred in 
museums.  This can basically be characterized as assimilative.   Figure 9.3 demonstrates which 
areas of formal manifestations and conceptual understructure were attacked by colonial 
suppression and imposed authority.

In Figure 9.3 I have lightened the boldness of the connecting arrows to show that the 
connections have become weaker but that they have not disappeared altogether.   The surface 
forms of Kwakwaka’wakw culture have been appropriated and suppressed by Western 
colonialism but the erasure of underlying forms (belief systems) are less easily apprehended.  
This thesis has shown that while there are still Kwak’wala language speakers, while there are 
still members interested and invested in maintaining traditions and most importantly, where 
there are still Kwakwaka’wakw living within the traditional landscape of sea, forest and village, 
remnants of the traditional ontology are still evident.  
  
9.2 Metaphor of the Kwakwaka’wakw “house” 
Entering the 21st Century, the traditional Kwakwaka’wakw ontology has become weakened but it 
hasn’t been replaced altogether.  I credit this remarkable survival to two factors.  First, it is a 
testimony to the variety of ways in which a worldview is constructed and reinforced within the 
mind and second, it is testimony of the tenaciousness of the Kwakwaka’wakw to maintain their 
worldview and remain within their territories.   In regards to the first factor, if language and 
culture as formal manifestations are mutually supportive then as long as remnants of these 
systems remains there is still the ability to relate back to the originating conceptual 

471 
 
 
understructure.  In other words, losing the Kwak’wala language is indeed threatening to a 
traditional Kwakwaka’wakw ontology but through the maintenance of alternative forms there still 
exists the possibility of maintaining that belief system to some degree.  The connection is 
definitely weakened but not altogether lost by the replacement of Kwak’wala with English.  That 
being said I want to still emphasize that losing the language remains a significant threat to 
traditional Kwakwaka’wakw worldview.  It is as if the Kwakwaka’wakw “house” is held up by a 
number of weight bearing posts and with each post that is removed or weakened in its weight 
bearing ability, the remaining weight is spread amongst the other standing posts.  The 
Kwakwaka’wakw “house” is still standing but its structural stability has been weakened.  
Eventually if each post is weakened sufficiently it will no longer bear weight and collapse upon 
itself.   Using this analogy one can say that the Kwak’wala language is one of the major weight 
bearing pillars of the Kwakwaka’wakw house.  Figure 9.4 demonstrates this metaphor of the 
house.

                         Figure 9.4  Metaphor of the Kwakwaka’wakw “house” as a nation 
 
In order to maintain traditional Kwakwaka’wakw culture, our contemporary objectives remain in 
strengthening each post of the Kwakwaka’wakw traditional house.  This means revitalizing 
traditional social structure and governance, rituals, ceremonies and art, knowledge of traditional 
narratives and their relationship to our histories, the Kwak’wala language and our traditional 
    Posts:       language, stories/narrative, art,  traditional  
                     social structure,  rituals & ceremonies, land                

473 
 
 
relationship to the land. This revitalization must take place while acknowledging the context of 
the radical cultural change of the 20th century.    As Kwakwaka’wakw we must find ways of 
adapting and utilizing the introduced modern systems to traditional principles. It is not so much 
the technologies of the Western colonial culture which are antithesis to Kwakwaka’wakw ways 
of being but the principles and beliefs which guide and apply them.   As examples we can see 
how literacy was adopted by the Kwakwaka’wakw into their potlatch system in order to maintain 
records in “potlatch ledgers” at a time when much of the traditional means of maintaining oral 
histories were breaking down due to population loss and cultural oppression.  From a material 
standpoint we can see how from the introduction of blankets and buttons emerged a brilliant 
new art form that could further express familial and historic relationships through the 
development of the ‘kangexťola “button blanket”.  If we can firmly ground ourselves within the 
traditional principles and beliefs that our ancestors upheld and that is expressed within our 
language than we can adapt the institutions of education and social engagement as tools to suit 
our understanding of the world.   This is what I have referred to earlier as claiming “agency” and 
being active in our engagements rather than passively accepting a status quo which has been 
historically imposed upon us.  
 

474 
 
 
We have discussed in the previous section how the diversity of ways in which an epistomology 
is constructed and manifested has assisted a Kwakwaka’wakw worldview to survive into the 21st 
century.  The second factor influential in the contemporary survival of the Kwakwaka’wakw 
traditional worldview was the tenacity of our ancestors.  They fought the potlatch suppression 
and found sophisticated ways to get around it (Cole & Chaikin, 1990).  They resisted their 
children’s removal from their homes and placement in the residential school.  They also resisted 
the removal of their communities from traditional village sites to areas more convenient for the 
Indian Agent, or colonial government administration.  This is significant, as relocation was being 
used as a tactic all over Canada to remove Indigenous peoples from their traditional land base 
in order to gain access to resources (Ray, 2010).   As contemporary Kwakwaka’wakw we need 
to consider which aspects of our traditions our ancestors felt were most important to hold onto.  
Some academic research has posited that it was egotistical grandiosity which fueled the desire 
to maintain tradition in the face of opposition (Codere, 1950).  While an element of this can be 
considered I believe the majority of the impetus to maintain tradition would have come from 
social obligation and reciprocity in relationships between both rival nał’naḿima and the 
individual family members and their chiefs who made up the nał’naḿima.  It was these 
relationships that established for the people a sense of belonging and of contributing to a larger 

475 
 
 
whole that was connected both in time (to ancestors and future descendants) and space (to the 
village and to the land).   It was to the basic principle of Body=House=Land/World as 
Individual=Community/Village=Land/World  that was the impetus for their tenacity, their very 
sense of being on the world under a particularly Kwakwaka’wakw understanding as manifest in 
the Kwak’wala language.  This was the way our old people knew their place in the world, what 
was expected of them and the purpose of their life.  It is no wonder they held on so hard to their 
traditions and under this premise the statement of some of the old people that in being forced to 
give up their traditions they would no longer have anything to live for can be understood, not as 
a maniacal desire to outdo one another in a game of one-up-manship but in perpetuating a 
sense of belonging and of place. 
 
A better understanding of this impetus towards tradition is worth considering.   Modern capitalist 
influenced approaches to tradition would have it reduced to exotic spectacles worth paying 
money to see or to own, completely divorcing it from its original intent.  The magnitude of this 
pressure to appropriate tradition into spectacle can be understood in the context of the 
Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games where Pacific Coastal First Nations were heavily solicited to 
exhibit a viable commercial perspective on their cultures that pointedly avoided the unresolved 

476 
 
 
issues between First Nations and the Canadian nation state.   There is a vast spectrum of 
gradation between the objectives of tradition as experienced by our ancestors and the 
commercialization of tradition due to modern capitalist objectives for propaganda and profit.   
How we as Kwakwaka’wakw manage to find a balance between the two remains one of our 
contemporary challenges. 
 
9.3 The Kwakwaka’wakw “house” in the land 
As I have attempted to show throughout this thesis, spatial language in Kwak’wala is intimately 
connected to a particular landscape.   Kwak’wala linguistic forms emerge from the relationships 
of land, sea and village and within this context the Body=House=Land/World metaphor makes 
sense.  Having stated this, it becomes important then for contemporary Kwakwaka’wakw to 
maintain their places within their territories and re-occupy traditional sites.  This is proposed 
against the current movement towards Kwakwaka’wakw urbanization which removes the 
Kwakwaka’wakw from physically experiencing their traditional lands. The metaphoric traditional 
Kwakwaka’wakw “house” is one situated within Kwakwaka’wakw lands.  Figure 9.5 shows the 
village of Gwa’yi at ‘Ukwanalis in Kingcome Inlet.  It is one of the last occupied traditional 
villages within Kwakwaka’wakw territories. The importance of maintaining these communities 

477 
 
 
within their traditional locations, within their lands, cannot be understated.   This is the 
significance of the Kwak’wala formal expression of the spatial relationship between the body 
uḱwine’  “body” and the land awiŉagwis “land”.

The visual relationship of community within a landscape is made explicit within this aerial photo 
of Gwa’yi village “down river place” at ‘Ukwanalis “beach (or place of) body” in Kingcome Inlet 

478 
 
 
shows the primacy of the landscape as defined by land and water, upriver and downriver (see 
Map 13, Boas 1934).  It also shows how the individual would be spatially encompassed by the 
house, the village and the ultimately, the land. 
 
What does all of this mean to contemporary Kwakwaka’wakw?  If we consider the 
Kwakwaka’wakw relationship to land under the template of expanding and contracting spheres 
of analogous forms; the Body=House=Land/World metaphor as manifest in Kwakwaka’wakw 
culture is an empathetic one.  The similarity of formal structures is given more prevalence in the 
Kwakwaka’wakw mind rendering a conceptualization of objects and the land which emphasizes 
equivalence with humanity and similarity.   This is different from modern Western based human-
nature notions which de-emphasize empathy and highlight hierarchy. The Kwakwaka’wakw 
conceptual model that emerges is one of expanding spheres on a level playing field while the 
Western conceptual model is a hierarchy which places mankind above and nature below. The 
investment and engagement of this egalitarian Kwakwaka’wakw conceptual understructure are 
manifest in language, ceremonies artworks, storytelling, and actual engagement with the land.  
All is animate and granted the equivalent status as mankind, even at times recognizing that it is 
humanity that is subject to the land.  This empathetic understanding of human/land relationship 

479 
 
 
facilitates an approach to lands and resources which is mutually nurturing and extended over 
time.  In particular the Kwakwaka’wakw approach to time is more highly conscious of extensions 
into the past and the future.  Kwakwaka’wakw social obligation is not to just the current 
generation but to both ancestors and descendants.  The idea is embodied within the statement 
that we have been here since “time immemorial”.  This statement basically recognizes our 
commitment to a particular landscape that we are derived from and are committed to continue to 
occupy and nurture.  The relationship is symbiotic.  We are as much the land as the land is us.  
The Kwakwaka’wakw body IS the Kwakwaka’wakw house, which IS the Kwakwaka’wakw lands.   
This belief is the very essence of how we have understood ourselves as Kwakwaka’wakw 
human beings.  As Kwakwaka’wakw people we are bound by this belief system to each other 
and to the landscape.  In comparison, Western colonial approaches to the land appear 
fractured, exploitive and limited.  The fundamental conceptual premise of empathy and 
reciprocal responsibility between the self (body), society (house) and land (world) is not a belief 
system upheld by Western notions of the independent autonomous self which through 
capitalism encourages competition over cooperation, individualism over community, and 
privatization of lands over communal stewardship (Hall, 2010).  Having said all this, the 
complexity of the dilemma facing the modern Kwakwaka’wakw is that these beliefs as described 

480 
 
 
are traditional.  They are derived from an ancient way of living and from speaking a language 
which enforced this way of living.  What happens when the overwhelming forces of colonization 
and modern Western capitalism have changed the language and lifestyles of the majority of 
Kwakwaka’wakw peoples?  Our task becomes the translation of tradition into modern existence.  
This is not as difficult as it might initially appear.  My suggestion is that as long as we place our 
efforts in maintaining the basic principles manifest and expressed by tradition then the surface 
forms and technologies of the colonial west can be utilized to meet these ends, reinforcing and 
reinventing tradition.  This means a shift in focus to the concept of “understructure” and a shift in 
consciousness from the importance of “how we do things” which are formal considerations, to 
“why we do things”  which are conceptual considerations (Figure 9.3).    
 
9.4  Conflicting ideologies: Colonization, capitalism, the house, and the land  
The Kwakwaka’wakw do not exist in a static condition of perpetual tradition, despite having a 
cultural mandate to attempt this, but have been adapting and adjusting to the massive wave of 
change brought on by colonization in the last 200 years.  This cannot be ignored.  It is the very 
reason that the Kwak’wala language has become endangered and cultural practices have 
shifted.  Negotiating these changes has become the challenge not just to modern 

481 
 
 
Kwakwaka’wakw but all of the indigenous peoples around the world.   However, particular to the 
Kwakwaka’wakw and other indigenous coastal nations of British Columbia are the unresolved 
and conflicted issues around ownership/stewardship of lands in relationship to the colonial 
province of British Columbia and the mostly unsuccessful British Columbia Treaty process 
(1992-ongoing).  Land ownership/stewardship is the dominant issue that modern 
Kwakwaka’wakw face and the different perspectives on the relationship to land is where the 
metaphor of Body=House=Land/World gains in significance.  It is into this equation that the 
economic system of capitalism which has come with the colonization of British Columbia needs 
to be considered.   
 
Capitalism is an economic system based on the premises of private property (individual 
ownership of physical phenomena such as lands and resources), commodification (the 
assigning of standard values to goods, land and labour) and the establishment of a sovereign 
“modern” state which can uphold and enforce these notions (Wallerstein, 1992).   Capitalism 
has become the dominant global economic system of the 20th Century.  While capitalism, as an 
economic system, is not the same thing as colonialism its incentives are bound with those of 
imperialism and colonization.   

482 
 
 
Colonialism in North America emerged from European imperialism and the capitalist based 
need of European states to access new forms of both resources and labour.  Samir Amin (2006) 
states, “colonialism arose out of the economic and social logic of capitalism”. Colonization was a 
way of gaining access and control over regions and peoples outside of the originating country.  
The incentives for initial Western European contact on the British Columbia coast were capitalist 
in nature as the Spanish, British, and American traders arrived under the prospect of 
discovering and claiming new lands (and hence resources) and continued to return to the coast 
upon discovering a lucrative trade in sea otter furs (Gibson. 1992).  This introductory enterprise 
in a capitalist based relationship with the west based on the over hunting of the sea-otter 
brought to the Kwakwaka’wakw and other indigenous peoples of the coast, an initial influx of 
material wealth and prestige followed by the decimation of their populations by introduced 
disease.  As well, the almost complete annihilation of the sea otter disrupted the ecological 
balance of the coastal environment.  These episodes appeared to go against the concepts of 
empathy and balance accorded to traditional conceptual understanding of the relationship of 
people to the land.  Upon contact, what the Kwakwaka’wakw gained in terms of material wealth, 
they paid for in mortality.  The trajectory of capitalism would eventually lead to British 
colonization and the suppression of Kwakwaka’wakw cultural practices and language for 

483 
 
 
economic reasons.  The traditional social economic system of the potlatch went against the 
maximization of labour capital as participants were considered unproductive during the 
ceremonial season by the Indian Agents.  As well as the giving away, or “potlatching” of goods, 
rather than the accumulation of wealth was seen as illogical according to capitalist standards.    
    
Ultimately, the empathetic ideological approach to the landscape successfully practiced for 
thousands of years by the Kwakwaka’wakw did not function well with a modern capitalist system 
which required the land to be considered as a resource to be exploited for maximum profits.  
The emphasis of the Body=House=Land/World perspective lies with notions of collectivity and 
joint ownership of lands and resources.  The notion of collective stewardship and social 
accountability to group identity is anchored in the intermediate metaphor of the “house”.  The 
individual Kwakwaka’wakw “body” is contained within the social and historical “house”, which is 
contained within the land.   This notion of collective identity does not work well in a modern 
Western capitalist economy based on privatization of land and individual ownership.   In a sense 
the Western free market capitalist interpretation of the body to both social and geographic 
spaces could be considered Body House Land/World; the antithesis of the traditional 
Kwakwaka’wakw approach mapped out in this thesis. 

484 
 
 
Capitalism, as an economic system, was initially defined as “individualism” or “economic 
individualism” (Hessen, 2008).  It was called “economic individualism” due to its fundamental 
belief in the pursuit of individual self-interest and the individual right to own private property. 
Free market capitalism also posits that the role of the state (government) is to protect individual 
rights and freedoms in the pursuit of economic profits in order to foster economic growth.  
Robbins (2007) explains that collective ownership is a barrier to economic growth based on 
capital accumulation; the accumulation of wealth based on investment for profits, or “making 
money”: 
 
         The collective ownership of resources, which supports community solidarity 
represents a severe drag on capital accumulation for it inhibits the exchange and 
economic development of resources.  Value systems that attribute spiritual 
significance to objects in nature – animals, trees, plants, mountains, etc. – while 
serving important social and ecological functions are barriers to capital accumulation 
because they limit the exploitation and destruction of the environment and must be 
removed, modified, or ignored for capital accumulation to occur. 
(http//:www.faculty.plattsburgh.edu./Richard.robbins/staff/Polanyi.htm) 

485 
 
 
In order to maximize market potential, limits on resource exploitation must be removed as well 
as social obligations which might limit this exploitation.  In Figure 9.6 I have interpreted this as 
the capitalist hierarchy of the individual (Body) over society (House) and nature (Land/World).  
Connected to the notion of the individual is the concept of privatization which is realized in the 
relationship to land as “private property”.   Under the premise of “private ownership” individuals 
own land and are able to exploit land based resources with minimal regulation from social 
accountability.  In this way one can theorize that under capitalism it is necessary that the needs 
and desires of the individual “Body/Self” be prioritized over the social obligation and restraint 
represented by the House/Community (Body  House).

The hierarchical relationship of mankind over nature as an aspect of capitalism is also reflected 
in general Western beliefs systems. This belief was presented by Boas (1911) as being linked to 
racist notions of colonial white superiority over localized Indigenous populations.  He made the 
following introductory statement in his book “The Mind of Primitive Man” in order to discredit it 
throughout the text.   
 
         Proud of his wonderful achievements, civilized man looks down upon the humbler 
members of mankind.  He has conquered the forces of nature and compelled them 
to serve him.  He has transformed inhospitable forests into fertile fields.  The 
mountain fastnesses [security or refuge92] are yielding their treasures to his 
demands.  The fierce animals which are obstructing his progress are being 
exterminated, while others which are useful to him are made to increase a 
thousand fold.  The waves of the ocean carry him from land to land, and towering 
mountain-ranges set him no bounds.  His genius has moulded inert matter into 
powerful machines which await a touch of his hand to serve his manifold demand.  
With pity he looks down upon those members of the human race who have not

succeeded in subduing nature; who labour to eke a meagre existence out of the 
products of the wilderness; who hear with trembling the roar of the wild animals, 
and see the products of their toils destroyed by them; who remain restricted by 
oceans, rivers or mountains…What wonder if civilized man considers himself a 
being of higher order as compared to primitive man, if he claims that the white race 
represents a type higher than all the others! (pp.1-2) 
  
Notions of communal ownership and social accountability are paramount to maintaining a 
Kwakwaka’wakw traditional worldview.   These are ways of being, or beliefs which are manifest 
in the world and conceptually reinforced through the Body=House=Land/World metaphor and 
the Kwak’wala language.   The Kwakwaka’wakw belief system Body=House=Land/World as a 
way of being in the world is under duress due to Western colonial and capitalist expansion.   
 
To the Western mind the Kwakwaka’wakw cultural animation of all things may come across as 
irrational, fanciful, superstitious, and the product of a primitive mind.  To the Kwakwaka’wakw 
the cultural manifestation of the Body=House=Land/World metaphor formally expressed in the 
Kwak’wala language makes perfect sense in maintaining a closely connected network of human 

488 
 
 
to nature relationships that nurtured our existence for thousands of years with little sacrifice on 
the part of the land.  In the last two hundred years we have experienced both the demise of the 
Kwak’wala language that conceptually reinforced this empathetic conceptualization as well as 
the demise of the land itself as Western concepts of hierarchy and exploitation have taken over, 
creating clear-cut forests, poisoned rivers, diseased oceans and ultimately global warming.  This 
brings me back to one of the early questions posed by this thesis.  If we lose the Kwak’wala 
language how does it affect us as Kwakwaka’wakw?  The answer is complex and as stated 
earlier, involves primarily our relationship to each other and to the land. An extension of this 
question asks; what is the cost to modern society in general if we lose the concepts embedded 
in indigenous languages like Kwak’wala? 
 
9.5 Survival of the Kwak’wala language  and the Kwakwaka’wakw Peoples 
 
Replacing Kwak’wala with English shifts our relationship to our past, our histories, our lands and 
to each other as Kwakwaka’wakw people.  A complete disassociation however, is not 
completely valid while the landscape which gave birth to the language forms still remains 
occupied.  In other words, as long as the Kwakwaka’wakw continue to inhabit their ancestral 
lands a tenuous connection is still viable.  Certain symbolisms rendered through bodily 

489 
 
 
experience in a specific landscape will still render conceptual associations, which while suffering 
from the lack of cognitive reinforcement through language, can still exist.  These associations 
are like well-travelled paths.  The less the path is followed the less defined it becomes.  In many 
ways, the minds of modern Kwakwaka’wakw are criss-crossed by conceptual paths that were 
worn smooth by our ancestors but for us have become overgrown and hard to follow.  The 
premise is that these paths would become more clear and easier to travel upon through the 
reinforcement of Kwak’wala usage. 
 
The other issue at hand which tends to obscure this world-view, way of thinking or metaphorical 
“path/road” is that our relationship to our territories is changing.  Many of our people through 
circumstance have chosen to live in urban cities where the relationship of land and sea, 
upriver/downriver, night and day, winter and summer, the sacred and the ordinary are no longer 
relevant to modern life.  In these new contexts we are more likely to consider roads and cars, 
jobs and wages, housing, heat and electricity, work and entertainment to be more relevant to 
our internal concepts of navigating the world.  In this context, the symbolism, analogies and 
metaphors of the Kwak’wala language seem less relevant to a contemporary urban lifestyle.   
 

490 
 
 
Given this observation one would think traditional Kwakwaka’wakw ways of thinking beyond 
salvage and yet there remains this pervasive, stubborn way of being in the world and on the 
land which still has a heartbeat.  Within many Kwakwaka’wakw young people there still remains 
something of the way our old people thought of things.  Perhaps it is that we still occupy our 
territories to some degree, that we still travel the waters and that some Kwakwaka’wakw still live 
by the sides of rivers and the ocean.  It could be that even though translated for our benefit into 
English some of our stories that tell us who we are and where we come from still make it into 
our consciousness.  It is also possible that many of the Kwakwaka’wakw, still retain a memory 
trace of the language spoken by our parents and grandparents and the affection they expressed 
for family relationship and a sense of community and of place.  It could be that we still practice a 
broken and severely disrupted version of our traditional ceremonies and it could be that we are 
at least considering what it might mean to return to our traditional ways of governance.  But it is 
all very tenuous and the stakes are high.  The pressing influence of Western society is all 
around us and the mediation of our ways of thinking through modern media pervasive.  Over 
and over it is reinforced upon us, a globally promoted generic way of life which would have us 
separated from our lands, our histories and our traditional way of being in the world.  To relate 
to and understand our culture through exterior Western frameworks is to accept our culture as 

491 
 
 
merely a past-time, a recreational act, or entertainment; a surface cover, an outfit to wear on 
special occasions.   To our old people from one hundred years ago this perspective is 
completely foreign and yet in the words of Gloria Cranmer-Webster (1991), great-granddaughter 
of George Hunt; 
 
If my ancestors from two hundred years ago were able to be with us today, I often 
wonder what they would think of a contemporary potlatch.  Would they be able to 
recognize what we do as being related to what they did?  Would they pity us for 
having lost so much, or be proud that we are still here?  I think that after recovering 
from the shock of seeing so many changes, not only in the potlatch but in all aspects 
of our lives, they would tell us that under the circumstances, we are not doing too 
badly.  They would also urge us to keep on strengthening what we have, if we are to 
survive and continue having our good times (p. 248). 
 
The issues are complex and there are no black and white answers for how to proceed.  There 
are however some guideposts to help us navigate the difficult road we are faced with.   The 
Kwak’wala language embodies the traditional Kwakwaka’wakw way of being in the world and 

492 
 
 
the fact that young people still have the desire to learn it is hopeful.  This interest in the 
maintenance of Kwakwaka’wakw culture and the Kwak’wala language is the reason why this 
thesis exists.  The analysis presented in this dissertation seeks to explain why it is so vitally 
important, beyond a romanticised reinvestment in Aboriginal identity, to keep this language 
alive.   The visual component to this thesis sought to present these ideas in a public space as a 
complement to the written component.  Both written presentation in an academic setting and 
visual presentation in gallery and museum contexts are used by the author/artist as 
contemporary strategies for maintaining traditional concepts.   I cannot vouch for how 
successful this strategy will ultimately be but it serves as a testimonial to the ways in which the 
Kwakwaka’wakw have creatively found ways to perpetuate their ontology despite attempts to 
eradicate it.   My artwork and this thesis are my own attempts to perpetuate the traditions that 
were taught to me by prior generations.  It seemed important to enter the public realm outside of 
the Kwakwaka’wakw community and attempt to create dialogue and understanding between 
ourselves and the people we now share this land/space with.  It is ultimately a negotiation of 
space both physical and conceptual.   In considering the wider sphere of global relations and 
how the concepts within this thesis relate I am attempting to broaden the interpretation of the 
house as village or community to the modern concept of Canadian nationhood.  Not all readers 

493 
 
 
of this thesis or viewers of artwork are Kwakwaka’wakw , and yet I felt that there was relevance 
in the analysis for non-Kwakwaka’wakw under this broader application now that we are required 
to in a modern sense “share the same house”. 
 
9.6 The value of maintaining traditional Kwakwaka’wakw conceptual 
       understructure / worldview  on a global stage 
The overt colonization of the Kwakwaka’wakw people, our bodies, our society, our culture and 
our territories, has gone underground due to international pressure, and is no longer considered 
acceptable.  What we are fighting is the ongoing, less obvious colonization of our minds.  My 
presentation of the relationship of “form” and “meaning” throughout this thesis has shown that 
while the surface forms of our culture have been appropriated and oppressed the underlying 
conceptual understructure of that system still maintains a level of integrity.  It is at this level that 
we can still “think” like our Kwakwaka’wakw ancestors.  Full assimilation will only occur once we 
completely accept the conceptual frameworks and ways of thinking of Western colonization and 
its compatriot capitalism as the only way of approaching our relationship to each other and to 
our territories. For example, if we begin to think of the land as a resource to be exploited for our 
immediate economic benefit as individuals, in doing so, we discard our accountability to 

494 
 
 
community, our ancestors and our descendants.  By accepting capitalist individualism as a 
viable worldview we sever the connection between the BODY, the HOUSE, and the LAND.  
Holding onto our language as indigenous people is the most direct access we have to our 
traditional conceptual frameworks and ways of thinking.  Maintaining the Kwak’wala language 
as a living language strengthens the BODY=HOUSE=LAND/WORLD connection that maintains 
we are all equals in the experience of our existence in the world and that we are obligated to 
practice both empathy and accountability to our communities and to the lands and territories we 
occupy.   It is unfortunate that this perspective of indigenous empathy with the land has been 
dismissed as a cliché at times.  Rather than attempt to build a thesis off of a perceived cliché or 
attempt to avoid it, the findings of the thesis itself re-assert the connection between the 
Kwakwaka’wakw, their communities and the land through an analysis of linguistic forms in 
Kwak’wala.   
 
The consciousness of conceptual frameworks is not an easy process to comprehend.  It first 
takes open-mindedness to understand that there are more ways of thinking about phenomena 
than just one.   When we are mono-lingual we take for granted that certain conceptual 
frameworks are in fact conceptual; that they are mapped out in the mind just as much as in the 

495 
 
 
world.  Concepts are ephemeral, interpretive and hard to pin down but the understanding that 
we perceive just as much with our minds as we do with our physical senses is a valuable one. 
Drawing an analogy between biology and intellect is helpful.   Biology requires diversity in order 
to thrive, as do ‘ways of thinking’. In facing greater and greater global challenges the world 
needs intellectual and cultural diversity to help solve its problems.   The world needs indigenous 
perspectives as it faces global deterioration in the face of industrialization and mass resource 
extraction and land exploitation.  The ontology of Body=House=Land/World worked for the 
Kwakwaka’wakw for thousands of years.  In the two hundred years since contact the Pacific 
Northwest coast has suffered serious environmental damage evident in disappearing salmon 
stocks and the loss of old growth forests.  In Gwa’yi (Kingcome Inlet), the valley has been 
completely logged out over the last 100 years and traditional fishing has been seriously 
impacted, particularly the annual eulachon run from which the traditional staple `tłi’na “grease93” 
is derived. In 2010 Gwa’yi Village experienced the worst flooding in its recorded history and the 
village was evacuated by helicopter and rebuilt.  The extreme nature of this flood was due to a 
                                                 
93 `tłi’na “grease” is an oil derived from a small fish called dzaxwan “eulachon”.  The eulachon run up river 
systems along the B.C. coast in the spring.  Amongst the Kwakwaka’wakw the major river systems for 
eulachon runs are based in Knights and Kingcome Inlet.  The annual rendering of the `tłi’na by 
communities an activity of major cultural significance. 

496 
 
 
combination of unusually high rainfall, and changes in the river system due to accelerated 
glacial run off due to global warming.   
 
While it is obvious that the health of the land has been impacted, so has the health of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw peoples, which has become ravaged by startling rates of diabetes brought on 
by an imposed change of diet from traditional staples derived from the local environment to 
imported cheap foods high in sugar and salt and low on nutritional value.  While the 
Kwakwaka’wakw lands suffer from ill health and mortality of species so too, does the 
Kwakwaka’wakw human body.   These are serious issues requiring solutions and redress that 
are affecting, not just the Kwakwaka’wakw, but the globe.   It is not just the Kwakwaka’wakw 
who are suffering from the effects of capitalist inspired colonization of their lands and bodies but 
considerable global populations (society/house) as well as geographies (lands) as well are 
reeling from the effects of exploitation.  We see the results of this environmentally in global 
warming, diseased oceans, and species in decline.   Human health is experiencing an alarming 
rise in global obesity rates in developing countries (Kim & Popkin, 2005) while simultaneously 
experiencing an increase in climate related diseases such as malaria in underdeveloped 
countries (Patz, Gibbs, Foley, Rogers, & Smith, 2007).   An additional threat to human health 

497 
 
 
and habitation exists through climate change influenced environmental distruptions such as 
hurricanes and massive flooding The effect of climate change (land/world well-being) on human 
health (body well-being) was addressed succinctly by Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of 
the World Health Organization (WHO) in the following remark made at the United Nations 
General Assembly on Oct 24, 2008: 
 
         We are meeting at a time of crisis. We face a fuel crisis, a food crisis, a severe 
financial crisis, and a climate that has begun to change in ominous ways.  All of 
these crisis have global causes and global consequences.  All have profound and 
profoundly unfair, consequences for health. (Chan,  World Health Organization 
[WHO], 2008) 
 
The health of human populations is intimately tied into the health of the planet.  Socially, 
as human industry induced stresses continue to deteriorate oceanic health, freshwater 
sources and arable land affecting agricultural productivity, competition over food and 
water sources may erupt in human conflicts and hinder the ability of governments to 
maintain order and authority (Fidler, 2009).  This brings into question the health of “the 

498 
 
 
house” as a social order.  In this thesis we have considered the “house” to be the family, 
community and village.  In a broader interpretation we can call the “house” society.    
 
The Kwakwaka’wakw conceptual metaphor of Body=House=Land/World asks us to consider an 
alternative foundation for how to be in the world.   Some aspects of it are of socialist orientation. 
Within an increasingly capitalist extreme, this metaphor asks us to reconsider the balance 
between the needs of society and those of individuals at a time when socialism has been vilified 
by capitalist enterprises and the failures of 20th century communism.   In requiring a people to 
consider society and the land on par with the independent human being it at the very least 
provides an alternative to a global epidemic which has swept aside the concerns of socialism 
and environmentalism under the terms of capitalist expansion.  The importance of maintaining 
alternative systems cannot be understated.  The existence of alternatives helps to ensure that a 
single monolithic system does not rise up to dominate global relationships.  In addressing the 
legacy of Benjamin Whorf and linguistic relativism, Lakoff (1987) addresses the consciousness 
of alternative conceptual systems in the following way: 
 

499 
 
 
Like Whorf, I believe that differences in conceptual systems affect behavior in a 
significant way.  It is vitally important to understand just how our behavior is 
dependant on how we think.  In areas like human relationships, where failure rates 
tend to be higher than we would like them to be, an understanding of differences in 
conceptual systems, and how behavior depends on them, might well be helpful… 
…Conceptual relativism of the sort that appears to exist does not rule out universal 
ethical standards of some sort – at least as far as I can determine.  Nor does it seem 
to tell us very much about what such standards should be.  However, a refusal to 
recognize conceptual relativism where it exists does have ethical consequences.  It 
leads directly to conceptual elitism and imperialism – to the assumption that our 
behavior is rational and that of other people is not, and to attempt to impose our way 
of thinking on others.  Whorf’s ethical legacy was to make us aware of this (p. 337). 
 
Acknowledging that there are equally valid cross-cultural differences in conceptualizing our 
relationships in numerous spheres of thought is valuable.  Perhaps, this was the root of Franz 
Boas’ final thoughts on culture difference.  Despite that the majority of his academic colleagues 
dismissed his copious collecting and publishing of  Kwakwaka’wakw texts, he felt that under 

500 
 
 
their own conditions these thoughts, reflections and observations were valuable both to the 
people who expressed them and in and of themselves, and perhaps, just maybe they could 
prove to be valuable within Western academic and societal frameworks if those frameworks 
could possibly be reconfigured to consider the notion that indigenous voices actually have 
something to contribute besides the decorative, quaint or romantic.  
 
Ultimately, as my research suggests the Kwak’wala language anchors us to the land and to 
each other as Kwakwaka’wakw people, it reinforces connections in both time and in space.   
The Kwak’wala language manifests and reinforces an epistemology appropriate to the lands the 
Kwakwaka’wakw nations inhabit.  When the language is removed there are still non-linguistic 
structures in place to maintain this epistomology to some degree but it becomes severely 
weakened.  We may hold onto the surface signifiers of our culture but fail to grasp the 
underlying concepts from which those forms arose.  In a worst case scenario we will no longer 
live on our lands, nor speak our language but fight each other over possible monetary profits to 
be made from their exploitation from our offices in the city.  When it comes time to sign 
documents with Canadian federal and/or British Columbia provincial representatives we will pull 
out our regalia, dress up and play the part while forgetting all our ancestors believed in; our 

501 
 
 
symbols, our bodies and our minds completely assimilated.   Or alternatively, it is possible we 
will hold onto our principles and values as expressed to us through our traditional culture and 
language and uphold a bastion of society where social obligation and environmental 
stewardship are prioritized over profits.  Perhaps other nations will take notice and from our 
example be influenced to consider realignment of their own priorities.  Perhaps then, as 
indigenous ideas are incorporated into national political policies we will then be embraced as 
partners in nation building rather than a marginalized, social problem left over from the failed 
colonial policies of eradication and assimilation. 
 
We, the Kwakwaka’wakw live in a tenuous state but not a hopeless one.  If we can bring a 
consciousness to these issues then we can acknowledge that in order to survive as 
Kwakwaka’wakw people we need to retain both our language and our lands.  We need to return 
to our understanding of our relationship to one another as families and ‘naḿima, we need to 
reconnect our cultural ceremonies with the social political structure it used to represent and find 
strength in unification and reciprocal obligation rather than individualization.  It might also 
benefit Western society, to consider our traditional approach to the land in empathetic ways 
since their current approach threatens to send us all into deprivation.  I would like to quote 

502 
 
 
Lakoff & Johnson (1999) here in a statement that seems to reflect the same philosophy of 
traditional Kwakwaka’wakw.  They arrive at their opinion after questioning the history of Western 
intellectual thought and helping to give birth to cognitive linguistics.  The Kwakwaka’wakw 
arrived at the same conclusion after successfully living in our lands for thousands of years. 
 
The environment is not an “other” to us.  It is not a collection of things that we 
encounter.  Rather, it is part of our being.  It is the locus of our existence and 
identity.  We cannot and do not exist apart from it.  It is through empathetic 
projection that we come to know our environment, understand how we are a part of 
it and how it is part of us.  This is the bodily mechanism by which we can participate 
in nature, not just as hikers or climbers, or swimmers, but as part of nature itself, 
part of a larger, all encompassing whole.  A mindful embodied spirituality is thus an 
ecological spirituality. 
 An embodied spirituality requires an aesthetic attitude to the world that is central to 
self-nurturance, to the nurturance of others, and to the nurturance of the world itself.  
Embodied spirituality requires an understanding that nature is not inanimate and 
less than human, but animated and more than human.  It requires pleasure, joy in 

503 
 
 
the bodily connection with earth and air, sea and sky, plants and animals – and the 
recognition that they are all more than human, more than any human beings could 
ever achieve.  Embodied spirituality is more than spiritual experience.  It is an ethical 
relationship to the physical world (p. 566). 
 
While the encroachment of the western European culture brought with it to the indigenous 
peoples of Canada inconceivable wealth in the form of new materials and technologies, it also 
brought disease, population decline, cultural oppression and appropriation.  Innovation, 
imagination, and perseverance have enabled indigenous peoples to successfully maintain on 
some level old traditions in new ways through incorporation.   This thesis has attempted to 
incorporate a distinctly Kwakwaka’wakw voice through the Kwak’wala language into a dialogue 
within academic and artistic public spaces.  I cannot vouch for how successful this strategy will 
ultimately be but it serves as a testimonial to the ways in which the Kwakwaka’wakw have 
creatively found ways to perpetuate their epistomology despite attempts to eradicate it.  The 
impetus is that by speaking out perhaps the traditional thoughts and philosophies of the 
Kwakwaka’wakw and other indigenous nations have a chance to still influence the trajectory of 
Western thought and hence political action.  We as Kwakwaka’wakw are not alone in the issues 

504 
 
 
we face in regards to our relationship to society and land.  Canada, as a relatively newly formed 
nation also faces decisions on how it will continue to fabricate its social relationships within the 
defined geographic region of what is now called upper North America.  Is it still possible to have 
an effect on how these relationships are mapped?  Is it remotely possible that Kwakwaka’wakw 
concepts and the concepts of other indigenous nations that now are now contained within the 
modern nation state of Canada can influence the principles and hence practices of our 
environmental policies?   The technologies of the “West” are brilliant achievements but they are 
directed in their application by the principles and beliefs of those who have the power to define 
their focus and activity.  So far, the Canadian state has not allowed a place at the table for the 
voices of indigenous peoples but has continued to deny indigenous agency and abilities while 
pursuing less overt policies that are basically assimilationist.   This is only a detriment to the 
Canadian state.  By considering the incorporation of indigenous concepts, such as the 
Kwakwaka’wakw upheld of social and land based obligation the modern state of Canada might 
have a better shot at resolving the dilemmas of human health and environmental degradation 
which currently are only increasing.   This failure of the state to truly listen to indigenous voices 
may become a tragedy for all Canadians.

Throughout this dissertation we have seen how the relationship between the Kwakwaka’wakw 
individual, the community and the land is an empathetic one.  We occupy our individual body 
but it is a body composed of extended relationships to our family, community and our 
environment in space, and our histories in time. The traditional Kwakwaka’wakw way of being in 
the world is a valuable one with much to offer us as human beings.  It is worth our while to 
continue to strive to keep this way of life alive but in order to succeed at this we will need to 
work hard to keep our language alive, continue to live within our lands, and hope for meaningful 
dialogue with other nations in terms of how we negotiate our shared future.   With optimism, the 
last word I will leave to one of our ancestors, recorded by George Hunt, many years ago: 
 
         Prayer of a Sick man and his Relatives to the Sun 
 
        Waga’ wax dukwalał gaxan, gigame’, umpdzi kas waxa’os damodalaxganu’xw 
ťsiťsaxḱulam dł’gwan wawaxtusak, kas waxa a’ix’idamas gaxanu’xw, tatusalagilidzi,

         Ha, nanax’ma’ya Tłisala

        “ Please, look upon me Chief, Great Father, and have mercy and protect us against 
our sickness (me) and my relatives, and pray make us well, Great-Walking-All-Over-
the-World, for you are making in every way this world that you made. Great-
Walking-to-and-fro-all-over-the-World, Father.”   
         “Ha,” answers the Sun.
