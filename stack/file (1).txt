Abstract
One of the most remarkable features of the human brain is its ability to adapt rapidly and effi-
ciently to external task demands. Novel and non-routine tasks, for example, are imple-
mented faster than structural connections can be formed. The neural underpinnings of
these dynamics are far from understood. Here we develop and apply novel methods in net-
work science to quantify how patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions
reconfigure as human subjects perform 64 different tasks. By applying dynamic community
detection algorithms, we identify groups of brain regions that form putative functional com-
munities, and we uncover changes in these groups across the 64-task battery. We summa-
rize these reconfiguration patterns by quantifying the probability that two brain regions
engage in the same network community (or putative functional module) across tasks.
These tools enable us to demonstrate that classically defined cognitive systems—including
visual, sensorimotor, auditory, default mode, fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular and salience
systems—engage dynamically in cohesive network communities across tasks. We define
the network role that a cognitive system plays in these dynamics along the following two
dimensions: (i) stability vs. flexibility and (ii) connected vs. isolated. The role of each system
is therefore summarized by how stably that system is recruited over the 64 tasks, and how
consistently that system interacts with other systems. Using this cartography, classically
defined cognitive systems can be categorized as ephemeral integrators, stable loners, and
anything in between. Our results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding
the dynamic integration and recruitment of cognitive systems in enabling behavioral adapt-
ability across both task and rest conditions. This work has important implications for under-
standing cognitive network reconfiguration during different task sets and its relationship to
cognitive effort, individual variation in cognitive performance, and fatigue.

Author Summary
As we go about the day, our brains must quickly adapt in accordance with our internal
goals. These modifications generally occur within the constraints of a fixed structural
architecture, thus manifesting as rapid changes in the recruitment of and integration
between brain regions conforming to task demands. For example, regions of the visual sys-
tem are preferentially recruited as we perform a visual task, motor regions are recruited in
the execution of actions, frontal networks bias signals to other networks by differentially
integrating across them, and the default mode network is activated during introspection as
opposed to task execution. However, there is as yet no common framework under which
the role of each cognitive system in a task can be defined in a normative way with respect
to both other systems and the rest of the brain. Here, we address this issue by formalizing
a network-based theoretical framework in which the role of each cognitive system is
defined based on its level of recruitment and integration defined dynamically across a bat-
tery of cognitive tasks.
Introduction
A major goal of cognitive neuroscience is to discover the role that each brain region plays in
enabling complex behaviors [1]. The search for this map between structure and function has
advanced significantly over the past few decades [2]. Large volumes of cortical tissue such as
the visual or auditory cortex are mapped to gross functions such as sensory perception [3, 4];
while small volumes are mapped to subfunctions, such as the processing of faces and places
[5]. Historically, these maps of regions to roles have been defined primarily based on univariate
or multivariate neural responses to a variety of task conditions [6]. Recent efforts have
extended these tools to encompass the interactions between regions in the context of a func-
tional network spanning the entire brain [7, 8]. However, principled approaches by which
whole-brain functional networks can inform the roles of brain regions in enabling behavior
remain limited [9].
Network theory offers a framework in which regions or cognitive systems can be compared
with one another according to their topology, lending insight into their function [7] and evolu-
tion [10]. Indeed, network statistics derived from graph theory have been successful in summa-
rizing the topology of brain regions [11] and systems [12] involved in resting state functions,
potentially shedding light on their roles in enabling behavior [13]. For instance, the fronto-cin-
gulo-parietal network is comprised mainly of nodes with extensive inter-system connections,
potentially facilitating its role as a control circuit for diverse cognitive processes [12, 14, 15].
While these approaches provide valuable information about average resting state function,
they remain unable to address the dynamic roles of cognitive systems elicited by task execution,
where systems may integrate with one another in complex and continually changing spatio-
temporal patterns [16–19].
Indeed, understanding how cognitive systems interact with one another during different
tasks is critical to understand cognitive processing. Evidence suggests that network topology
differs in different task states [20–23], and indeed task state can be predicted from patterns of
functional connectivity using machine learning techniques [24–28]. Functional network topol-
ogy also changes with task practice [17, 18, 29–31] and with the degree of cognitive effort
required by the task [32]. Fundamental features that characterize these changes are far from
understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that interactions between cognitive systems
form fundamental drivers for network reconfiguration across task demands [33], facilitating

cognitive processes from learning [30] to memory [34]. Yet, a definitive statistical framework
in which to characterize and categorize the time-dependent interactions between cognitive sys-
tems is lacking.
To address this gap, we make use of the time-dependent community structure of functional
brain networks to characterize the dynamic roles of cognitive systems as they evolve during
task performance. We derive a set of networks representing functional brain connectivity
matrices during different tasks (Fig 1A). We then identify the community structure of the net-
work (Fig 1B), which uncovers functional clusters (communities) composed of groups of brain
regions that display dense functional connections with other regions in their group and sparse
functional connections with regions in other groups. To characterize the dynamic roles of cog-
nitive systems, we summarize the co-occurrence of regions (or systems) in communities with a
module allegiance representation (Fig 1C): pairs of brain regions that co-occur often in the
same community, across tasks, have high allegiance values. Finally following [30], we define
the dynamic network recruitment of a system as the probability that its regions co-occur in
communities with regions from the same system, and the dynamic network integration as the
probability that its regions co-occur in communities with regions from other systems. We com-
bine these two dimensions into a cartographic representation, which classifies cognitive sys-
tems into system-independent ‘network roles’ according to their dynamic pattern of intra- and
Fig 1. Overview of the methods. (A) A functional connectivity matrix is derived for each task condition as the Pearson correlation between the time series of
every pair of nodes. This results in a set of weighted graphs of the same size, one for each task condition. For simplicity, the network is represented here as a
binary network, with nodes identified by an index and by an association to a putative system (e.g. A1, A2, . . .). To identify the community structure of this
multislice network, the identity of each node is imposed by adding interslice connections (dashed lines) between identical nodes across slices. (B) Using a
dynamic network clustering approach known as multislice community detection (see Methods), we extract the community structure of the network for each
individual task. Each community is represented by a different color. (C) The module allegiance matrix conveniently summarizes the community structure of
the network across tasks. Each entry i, j of the matrix corresponds to the percentage of tasks in which regions i and j belong to the same community,
describing how regions (A1, A2, . . ., D4) and large-scale systems (SA, SB, SC, SD) are dynamically engaged during the task battery. Nodes that tend to co-
occur in the same communities are represented by brighter colors than nodes that tend to operate in isolation. (D) By comparing the recruitment and
integration of each system with a null-model (see Methods), we can extract 9 system-independent ‘network roles’, yielding a cartographic representation of
cognitive systems. The systems depicted in the previous insets (SA, SB, SC, SD) represent examples that could occupy each of the four corners.

inter-module allegiance over task conditions (Fig 1D), from ephemeral integrators (which tran-
siently integrate with other systems) to stable loners (which remain functionally separated
across the entire task battery). The resulting cartography parsimoniously summarizes dynamic
roles of cognitive systems in the context of task execution.
We apply this approach to context-dependent functional connectivity matrices extracted
from BOLD fMRI data acquired during the performance of 64 cognitive tasks. The tasks were
defined using the Permuted Rule Operations (PRO) cognitive paradigm [35], which contains
12 rules that are permuted into 64 distinct but related task states co-localized in short task
blocks (see S1 Fig). We hypothesized that brain regions within known cognitive systems would
be dynamically recruited consistently across task states. Additionally, we hypothesized that sys-
tems would vary in the degree to which they were integrated in the brain: regions in executive
systems being more dynamically integrated with other cognitive systems for control and man-
agement, and regions in the default mode or cerebellar systems being less dynamically inte-
grated with other cognitive systems. Finally, we hypothesized that the dynamic roles of
cognitive systems would vary in rest versus task states: executive systems being less dynamically
integrated during rest than during active task conditions.
Results
Recruitment of and Integration Between Brain Areas
Intuitively, a cognitive system can be defined as a set of brain areas that work together to enable
a cognitive function. Pragmatically, a cognitive system can be identified as a set of brain areas
that are more functionally connected to other members of the set than to the rest of the brain.
Prior work has uncovered 14 such cognitive systems from resting state fMRI data acquired in
N = 264 brain areas [13] and we hypothesized that these systems would also be recruited cohe-
sively as network communities during task execution (See Supplement for a discussion regard-
ing important considerations associated with this choice of parcellation). To verify our
hypothesis, we used a multislice community detection algorithm [36] to identify groups of
brain regions that form network communities (putative cognitive systems) in each of 64 dis-
tinct but related tasks. We then summarized these data by calculating an N × N module alle-
giance matrix, where the ijth element gave the percentage of tasks in which both region i and
region j belonged to the same community. The module allegiance matrix provides a summary
representation of how brain regions and large-scale systems are dynamically and cohesively
engaged during the task battery (Fig 2A).
The dynamic role of a brain region within this wider network can be parameterized along
two dimensions: How cohesively recruited is the region to its own cognitive system across the
task battery? And how consistently integrated is the region with other cognitive systems across
the task battery? Using the module allegiance matrix, we define two coefficients to address
these questions. The recruitment coefficient ðRS
i Þ estimates the probability over the task battery
that a given region i in system S is in the same network community as other regions of its own
system. The integration coefﬁcient ðIS
i Þ estimates the probability over the task battery that a
given region i in system S is in the same network community as regions from other systems
(see Fig 2A and 2B for a schematic representation of the concepts and see Methods for mathe-
matical deﬁnitions). Importantly, these two coefﬁcients are not mathematically equivalent to
either the strength of functional or structural connectivity emanating from a region. Instead,
dynamic network recruitment and integration quantify the time-dependent probability that a
region will associate with different systems under different tasks (integration) or the time-
dependent probability that a region will associate with its own system under different tasks
(recruitment).

We observe that brain areas differ in their degree of dynamic network recruitment to a cog-
nitive system across the task battery, and in their degree of dynamic network integration with
brain regions of other systems (Fig 2C). These differences suggest that regions may play differ-
ent roles within a cognitive system in the execution of this task battery and accompanying
neurophysiological processes. Despite this variability, we also notice a more general trend: that
regions tend to be recruited to their own cognitive system, and are less integrated with other
cognitive systems, as demonstrated by the warm block-like structures along the diagonal of the
matrix shown in Fig 2A. This pattern of results suggests that cognitive systems act as dynami-
cally cohesive network units.
Roles of Cognitive Systems
The regional results in the previous section tend to support the hypothesis that systems are
recruited together as network communities more consistently than non-systems, and are inte-
grated less consistently than non-systems. To address this hypothesis more formally, we define
recruitment and integration coefficients for systems as opposed to regions. First, we define the
recruitment coefficient of a system as the probability that any node from that system is part of
the same network community as other regions from that system (see Methods for formal defi-
nitions). Similarly, we define the integration coefficient between two systems as the probability
that a node from one system is in the same network community as a node from a different sys-
tem. Using a permutation test in which the associations of regions to systems is permuted uni-
formly at random (see Methods), we observe that systems tend to be more heavily recruited
Fig 2. Recruitment and Integration Coefficients Across Brain Regions. (A) The module allegiance matrix represents the probability that two brain
regions are part of the same community across the 64-task battery. Here, we ordered the nodes according to which cognitive system they belong to. Note the
warm block-like structure along the diagonal of the matrix, which suggests that cognitive systems identified from resting-state data tend to be recruited
together during task execution [33]. (B) Within each row/column of the module allegiance matrix, the average allegiance value within a system yields the
recruitment coefficient, and the average value outside of a system yields the integration coefficient. Here, we highlight one column of the module allegiance
matrix, corresponding to one node within the default mode network, to illustrate the calculation of the recruitment coefficient and the integration coefficient of
individual brain regions. (C) Recruitment (top) and integration (bottom) coefficients for each brain region. Recruitment and integration are weakly correlated
over brain areas (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = (262) = 0.31). Note that these measures vary across the brain and that nearby regions tend to have
similar recruitment and integration coefficients, potentially revealing the presence of a larger scale structure.

(p < 0.001; R ¼ 0:6286; 95% CI [0.5881, 0.5920]) and less strongly integrated (p < 0.001;
I ¼ 0:5856; 95% CI [0.5896, 0.5901]) than non-systems, where we deﬁne a non-system to be a
randomly chosen set of brain areas.
While all cognitive systems are consistently recruited as network communities in this
64-task battery, we do observe that systems vary in the strength of dynamic network recruit-
ment and integration (Fig 3A). Some systems—including the visual and somatosensory sys-
tems—are consistently highly recruited across the task battery while other systems—including
the ventral attention and subcortical systems—are inconsistently recruited across the task bat-
tery (see diagonal values in Fig 3A). Furthermore, some systems—including the dorsal atten-
tion system—are highly integrated with the majority of other systems, while other systems—
including the default mode and cerebellar systems—are weakly integrated with the majority of
other systems (see off-diagonal values in Fig 3A).
This type of data can be viewed parsimoniously as a graph, in which nodes represent cogni-
tive systems and edges represent the dynamic network integration between those systems (see
Fig 3B). The default mode and cerebellar systems have on average low dynamic network inte-
gration with other systems, as does to a lesser extent the subcortical system. We also observe
that systems involved in attentional control (cingulo-opercular, dorsal attention, and salience)
tend to be well integrated among themselves, as well as with the motor, fronto-parietal, and
memory systems. Finally, we see that the fronto-parietal and memory systems are well inte-
grated with one another, consistent with their shared role in executive processing. This graphi-
cal representation allows us to see that cognitive systems form a heterogeneous collective,
linked by complex dynamical integration patterns over a task battery.
Characterizing cognitive systems in terms of their pairwise integration with other systems
can reveal interesting aspects of how different systems of the brain interact in order to allow
for complex tasks to be executed efficiently. To summarize the roles of cognitive systems
within this broader milieu, we calculated each system’s average dynamic network integration
(to all other systems) and dynamic network recruitment during the task battery (Fig 3C). We
used these two variables to map cognitive systems into a 2-dimensional interaction space,
providing a cartographic representation of task-based cognitive function (Fig 3D). We then
assigned a role title to each cognitive system by determining whether its dynamic network
recruitment and integration were less than, similar to, or greater than expected in an appro-
priate null model. In the context of dynamic network recruitment, systems could be classi-
fied as either (i) ephemeral (less than null), (ii) unstable (similar to null), or (iii) stable
(greater than null); in the context of dynamic network integration, systems could be classi-
fied as either (i) loner (less than null), (ii) connector (similar to null), or integrator (greater
than null).
In this functional cartography, the memory system is a stable integrator, with both high
recruitment and high integration coefficients. The default mode and cerebellar systems are sta-
ble loners, with high recruitment but low integration coefficients. The subcortical system is an
unstable loner, while most of the remaining systems are stable connectors. The ventral attention
system was the only system indistinguishable from the null model, receiving the generic label
of unstable connector.
Divergent Roles of Cognitive Systems in Distinct Cognitive States
When building a map of the roles that cognitive systems play in the execution of this task bat-
tery and associated neurophysiological processes, it is critical to ask whether such a map is gen-
eralizable across brain states, or whether it remains specific to the task set chosen. Is the brain
characterized by a single map or by a family of maps, each obtained from different sets of

cognitive states? In other words, do all cognitive systems always play the same role in every set
of tasks, or do they play different roles, and if so, how different? To address these questions, we
extracted the functional cartography from resting state data acquired on the same individuals
who performed the 64 task battery (see Methods).

We observed that the values obtained for the recruitment and integration coefficients reduced
to approximately half of that observed in the 64-task data (Fig 4A). The reduced dynamic net-
work recruitment could be caused by a higher temporal variability in rest than task states. We
tested this possibility by calculating the network flexibility, defined as the proportion of task con-
ditions in which a brain region changes its community allegiance, averaged over all brain regions
in the network. Indeed, the average flexibility of subjects was significantly greater in the rest state
than in the task state (two-sample t-test t(14) = 6.24, p < 0.001). The reduced dynamic network
integration, on the other hand, cannot be understood solely in terms of network flexibility, and
suggests that the rest state is a baseline condition of brain functioning, with fewer interactions
between systems than is necessary for task execution. Three distinct roles are observed in the rest
data: the somatomotor face system as a stable integrator; ventral attention, auditory and cingulo-
opercular systems as stable connectors, and the remaining as stable loners (Fig 4B).
A direct contrast between task and rest was achieved by comparing the dynamic network
recruitment and integration of each system with its respective null models. This comparison
revealed a general trend for cognitive systems to be more highly recruited during rest, indicat-
ing an overall greater temporal cohesiveness of each cognitive system—consonant with the fact
that these systems were defined from resting state data. In particular, the three systems labeled
as unstable during task—subcortical, ventral attention and ‘other’—were labeled as stable dur-
ing rest (Fig 5, left panel).
In contrast to the 64-task-based cartography, most of the integration coefficients at rest
were lower than the null model, indicating a tendency for cognitive systems to become more
temporally dissociated during the rest state. This pattern is particularly salient in the memory
system, which changes its role from a stable integrator in the task state to a stable loner in the
rest state. In addition, several other systems labeled as connectors during task are classified as

loners during rest: dorsal attention, salience, fronto-parietal, somatomotor hand and visual.
The default mode system serves as another striking example of dynamic dissociation during
rest. While it remained a stable loner across conditions, its integration coefficient reduced from
approximately five to twenty standard deviations below the null model mean, supporting its
role as an internally cohesive but externally isolated system (Fig 5, right panel).
Discussion
The human brain is composed of areas that each perform specialized functions and yet work
together in concert to enable behavior. An area’s role in enabling dynamic cognitive computa-
tions within this network can be reflected in its profile of functional connectivity to other areas.
A rapid and efficient reconfiguration of an area’s connectivity allows for novel and non-routine
tasks to be implemented on short time scales. In this study, we presented a novel method to
characterize the dynamics of brain network reconfiguration as human subjects performed a
battery of 64 distinct but related tasks. We use these methods to assign network roles to differ-
ent cognitive systems based on (i) how stably the system is recruited over the 64 tasks, or (ii)
how consistently the system interacts with other systems. The resulting cartographic represen-
tation provides a useful conceptual framework for understanding the unique roles of cognitive
systems in enabling behavioral adaptability.
System-General Features
As the brain flexibly processes the 64 distinct but related tasks, cognitive systems all share two
common features: systems are more heavily recruited and less heavily integrated than non-
Fig 5. Cognitive Systems Are More Recruited and Less Integrated During Rest. The recruitment and integration coefficients of each system were
compared to its task and rest null models. Axes are expressed in terms of number of standard deviations away from the mean of the null distribution. The
region above/below the diagonal line indicates that the coefficient is higher/lower at rest than during task. Systems whose coefficients are significantly above
the null model are colored in red; systems whose coefficients are significantly below the null model are colored in blue; systems whose coefficients are
indistinguishable from the null model are colored in gray. Systems that changed subregions between task and rest are represented in two colors, one for
each condition.

systems. These results suggest that cognitive systems act as cohesive network units within the
whole-brain, potentially forming putative functional modules that each enable specific cogni-
tive processes. Such a decomposable organization [37] is conceptually in line with the historical
appreciation of “modules” in the brain, which—while not completely encapsulated as suggested
several decades ago [38]—form cohesively interacting sets of brain areas that enable a specific
cognitive process or behavior.
With the advent of network science, it has become possible to quantify the presence of mod-
ules in the brain as groups of regions that are more densely functionally connected than
expected in an appropriate null model. The modular organization of the brain, evident in stud-
ies of both structural and functional connectivity and across a range of spatial scales [11, 39–
41], is thought to enable efficient processing of specialized cognitive functions while maintain-
ing global network integration [42]. Indeed, clinical conditions in which brain network modu-
larity has been altered are commonly associated with broad impairments in cognitive and
behavioral abilities. For example, changes in modular structure in schizophrenia [43], unipolar
depression [44], autism [45], and bipolar disorder [46] accompany the presence of diverse psy-
chiatric symptoms. Our work complements these studies underscoring the biological signifi-
cance of functional modules, by examining the temporal stability or flexibility of modular
structure as the human brain processes diverse task demands. Our results demonstrate that
cognitive systems form network modules, which while locally flexible, are globally stable across
disparate cognitive processes. It is intuitively plausible that the balance between local flexibility
and global stability might facilitate the adaptive yet robust nature of cognition [18].
When probing the relationship between the brain’s modular architecture and its network
dynamics, it is critical to take care in the interpretation of network statistics and to clarify features
of system activity and connectivity that may occur at different scales and in different imaging
modalities. For example, it is important to distinguish between a brain region’s recruitment to a
task as measured by the magnitude of BOLD activity [47] versus its dynamic network recruit-
ment over a task battery as measured by the time-dependent probability that the region will asso-
ciate with its own system under different task conditions [30]. Indeed, patterns of activity and
patterns of (dynamic) connectivity offer unique and complementary insights into the neurophys-
iological processes that accompany and drive cognition [17, 30, 48–50]. Similarly, it is important
to note that the dynamic network integration between systems is not mathematically equivalent
to the structural or functional connectivity between those systems, and can therefore provide dif-
ferential sensitivity to individual differences in human behavior [30]. More generally, therefore,
it is possible for a system to display strong structural or functional connectivity to other systems
but display weak dynamic network integration, indicating a low probability of its regions aligning
with the network communities of other cognitive systems during a task battery.
System-Specific Roles
While cognitive systems share features of high dynamic network recruitment and low dynamic
network integration, they also display broad heterogeneity, consistent with their differential
roles in the cognitive processes elicited by the 64-task battery. The cartographic representation
we propose provides dynamic network roles of cognitive systems that quantify the reconfigura-
tion of system interactions that enable the required cognitive processes (Fig 1D).
Stable integrators.
The memory system is assigned the role of ‘stable integrator’, being
both highly dynamically recruited and highly dynamically integrated. This role is consistent
with the system’s anatomical composition: the memory system contains one of the most highly
structurally and functionally integrated regions of the brain—the precuneus [51]—along with
portions of the posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortex [13].

Stable loners.
In contrast, the default mode and cerebellar systems were assigned the role
of ‘stable loners’, being highly dynamically recruited but weakly dynamically integrated with
other systems. Anatomically, the cerebellar cortex is a parallel-fiber system and this cytoarchi-
tectonic organization promotes little interactions between distant patches [52, 53], potentially
leading to its loner personality. The default mode system, on the other hand, is anatomically
distributed throughout the cortex and contains both highly connected areas (e.g., precuneus
[51, 54]) and highly disconnected areas (e.g., frontal cortex [55]). Functionally, however, the
segregation of the default mode system is readily apparent in its classically observed competi-
tion with the task-positive network: functional activation of the default mode consistently
accompanies functional de-activation of the task-positive network, underscoring its role as a
competitive rather than integrative system [56, 57]. In line with these observations, recent
work has described the default mode system as a “provincial” hub, given its low inter-system
functional connectivity in non-dynamic contexts [13, 58].
Unstable systems.
The subcortical system is assigned the role of ‘unstable loner’ and the
ventral attention system [59] is assigned the role of ‘unstable connector’. The unreliable
dynamic network recruitment of these systems across the 64-task battery indicates that these
systems do not form temporally cohesive network units. It is likely that the task battery we
study here does not recruit the entire set of regions to the same degree as the rest state did in
which they were defined.
Stable connectors.
Finally, the remaining systems were named stable connectors, indicat-
ing their roles as temporally cohesive network units with typical levels of dynamic network
integration.
The Default Mode System as a Stable Loner
Perhaps one of the most surprising roles uncovered by this dynamic network analysis is the
role of the default mode system as a stable loner. The reason this is surprising is that the default
mode system is often thought of as a central system in the brain’s structural connectome.
Recent evidence demonstrates that several default mode regions (apart from the inferior parie-
tal lobule, medial temporal, and medial prefrontal cortex) [60–63] are located in the rich-club
of white matter architecture [64]. The rich-club [65] is a set of densely interconnected hub
nodes, whose connections collectively span the rest of the brain. Why then is the default mode
a stable loner in terms of its network dynamics? The implications of structural network organi-
zation for task-based functional connectivity and its dynamics are relatively under-explored
[66]. Some very recent theoretical, computational, and empirical work has provided initial evi-
dence that this structural connectome can facilitate the coalescence of low-degree nodes into
functional subgraphs [67], but that structural connections are not the only (or best) predictor
of dynamic functional connections, which can instead be driven by polysynaptic pathways [68]
(See also the Supplement for supporting evidence that the default mode system is strongly
functionally segregated in these data). It is therefore clear that a comprehensive assessment of
the expected relationship between the structural connectome’s rich club, the default mode sys-
tem, and dynamic network recruitment and integration in task-based analyses is an important
direction for future research.
Roles of Cognitive Systems at Rest
Our results also reveal some fundamental differences in the cartography of cognitive systems
between the resting state and the set of states elicited by the 64-task battery. First, we observed
greater temporal variability in rest than task states, as evidenced by the fact that both recruit-
ment and integration coefficients reduce to approximately half of their task-based values. This

variability can be caused by less stable communities, with regions often changing their commu-
nity membership. We directly tested this hypothesis by demonstrating a lower average flexibil-
ity in the task state than in the rest state. This result is initially counterintuitive, as the task state
requires subjects to perform 64 different tasks while the rest state requires subjects to simply
stay awake. The apparent paradox can be resolved in light of recent findings that the so-called
resting state is, in fact, a collection of many states dynamically fluctuating over time [69–72]. In
contrast, the 64 task battery constrains the brain to move within a fixed 64-dimensional space
in fixed temporal intervals, potentially leading to the observed low flexibility values.
Second, while most systems were assigned similar roles in both the resting state and the set
of states elicited by the 64-task battery, a few systems changed their roles and therefore deserve
additional attention. For example the memory system changed from a stable integrator in the
task state to a stable loner in the rest state, indicating a large dissociation of this system during
rest. Similarly, the visual system became less integrated in the rest state, changing from a stable
connector to a stable loner. These findings indicate that visual and memory systems tend to
become more isolated from the rest of the network, acting as independent units whose regions
have a less-than-average chance of associating with other systems. We speculate that the disso-
ciation of the visual system potentially reveals the rupture of the association between external
visual stimuli and internal mental states that was necessary during the task conditions. The dis-
sociation of the memory system in resting state is consistent with the recently observed causal
interactions between rest and the central executive system: inhibitory theta-burst transcranial
magnetic stimulation to central executive regions enhances default mode activity [73], indicat-
ing a causal and competitive relationship between the two systems.
It has been recently suggested that the intrinsic network architecture across tasks is highly
similar to the resting-state architecture [33]. Our results complement these findings by show-
ing that the average dynamic network recruitment and integration is substantially different
between the resting state and the set of states elicited by the 64-task battery. Specifically, in the
task-state, recruitment and integration coefficients are both higher than in the rest-state. This
suggests that, on average, cognitive systems are more consistently engaged as temporally cohe-
sive entities, and that they also have more temporally consistent network interactions between
one another in the task battery than they do at rest. This is possibly because the types of cogni-
tive processes involved in the tasks are more constrained (and require more energy) than the
types of cognitive processes that are present during rest. In contrast, at rest, the most energeti-
cally efficient configuration is to have cognitive systems at baseline (i.e. not integrating), and
have them be recruited sparingly. This can be understood as a cost-efficient solution to brain
activity.
Implications for Cognition
Cognitive functions are traditionally studied by manipulating distinct task elements and
observing differential neural and behavioral responses [74]. To address multiple cognitive
states, current techniques combine two tasks together simultaneously [75, 76], or study the
transitions between two distinct tasks separated in time (often referred to as “task switching”)
[77, 78]. Yet, because the putative task elements are often domain specific, this approach does
not lend itself to cross-domain comparisons. Here we offer such an approach by defining the
relationship of each region or system to the rest of the brain. This framework allows for differ-
ent tasks—or entire task sets—to be compared with one another in a statistically principled
manner, even when the tasks or task-sets being compared are quite different (See the Supple-
ment, for example, for a contrast between the dynamic network recruitment and integration of
cognitive systems in the 64-task set and a 7-task set from the Human Connectome Project).

This approach provides a mathematically robust complement to existing correlative methods,
which have already proven useful in understanding structural underpinnings of cognitive func-
tion [21, 22], the control of cognitive processes [79], and the brain’s dynamic cognitive range
[20, 23, 80].
The ability to study task sets begs the question of how tasks are related to one another. The
traditional view of mental chronectomy from Donders (1969) [81] suggests that brain states
are additive and therefore separable in both space and time. This assumption, which funda-
mentally underlies cognitive neuroscience, supports the notion that one can identify and com-
pare cognitive processes using linear (difference or subtraction) methods [82]: one can take
one cognitive process and compare a second process that differs in only one important respect,
and conclude that the difference between the two cognitive processes is revealed in the differ-
ence between the two sets of measurements associated with them [83]. Critically, this approach
enables one to study supposed individual task elements, even if these elements can never be
experienced in isolation. However, mounting evidence suggests the need to nuance this so-
called “process isolation” approach, by developing methods that can account for nonlinear
dependencies between cognitive processes [83]. For example, it has been shown that some cog-
nitive control areas are differentially activated by switches between different sets of tasks [78],
in different contextual variations [84], with different rewards [85], with skill acquisition [86],
and in switching from task A to task B versus switching from task B to task A [87–89]. The
existence of these non-additive effects complement known nonlinear processes identified in
healthy [83] and diseased [90] cortical activity.
However, it remains an open question how the brain moves between larger sets of tasks in a
time-dependent fashion. What network reconfigurations are required for a given trajectory
through the set of tasks? Do some trajectories or some task sets require different types of recon-
figuration patterns? Are there higher order temporal dependencies between network reconfigu-
rations required for consecutive task switches? Initial evidence from the literature suggests that
such higher order relationships do in fact exist. These studies are consistent with the notion
that cognitive systems dynamically adapt their network properties in a task-set-specific (as
opposed to a task-specific) manner, and therefore motivate the development of novel methods
to quantify these reconfiguration properties. The functional cartography approach that we
develop and apply here provides a quantitative characterization of the dynamic network role of
cognitive systems as the brain transitions between multiple tasks. In the future, these tools
could be used to quantify the cognitive difficulty of a set of tasks, or a trajectory through a set
of tasks, by determining distributions of recruitment and integration across cognitive systems.
Additionally, linking these quantifications of network reconfiguration to individual differences
in cognitive performance or fatigue during the performance of a set of tasks will be of particular
interest.
Methodological Considerations
Studies of network topology in the brain have historically operated under the implicit assump-
tion of constant interdependence between brain areas. This assumption is evident in the com-
mon consideration of a single time window over which measures of functional connectivity
such as correlation or coherence are computed and presumed to be constant. While these
approaches have provided us with a great understanding of large-scale properties of brain func-
tion, alternative formulations that consider the dynamic nature of these interdependence mea-
sures can reveal spatially distributed regions whose interdependencies change from time to
time or from condition to condition [17, 18, 71, 72, 91]. In particular, the modular organization
of the resting state network is itself time-dependent, being altered, for instance, by cognitive

effort [92] or learning [17]. Here we present an approach that directly addresses the dynamic
interaction of large-scale brain networks involved in cognitive processing. By summarizing
these dynamic interactions in the form of dynamic network recruitment and dynamic network
integration, we can extract functional roles of both regions and systems in any set of brain state
conditions (e.g., temporal conditions or task conditions).
It is important to define what the term dynamic network integration means in our formula-
tion, particularly as it distinguishes reliable partnering between systems from a random re-cou-
pling. A system with a high integration coefficient value must not only exhibit frequent
repartnering over time, but must also display at least one partner that occurs more often than
expected by chance, indicating temporal reliability. This is different than what would be
expected if nodes were assigned to communities uniformly at random, which would lead to a
relatively low average integration coefficient. Indeed, our definition of module allegiance
resembles that of a soft-partitioning—which describes the degree or probability of participation
of a node to each module [93], generalized to multislice networks.
A second important consideration lies in the fact that our proposed method can be adapted
to any spatial scale in which interdependence measures between network nodes can be defined.
For instance, dynamic network recruitment and integration can be defined for functionally
defined regions (e.g. the fusiform face area [94] or the parahippocampal place area [95] within
visual cortex), or anatomically defined regions (e.g. Broadman areas [96]). Moreover, these sta-
tistics could be defined for (i) individual neuronal spikes, (ii) LFPs from neuronal ensembles,
(iii) EEG or MEG sensors, or (iv) localized sources of EEG or MEG activity.
Finally, the methods and approaches that we introduce and exercise here demonstrate that
brain regions can move between communities as task demands change, consistent with prior
work in other task contexts [17, 18, 29, 30]. Yet, these observations have been made in the con-
text of fixed definitions for functional nodes and for functional systems. This area is ripe for
the development of other complementary approaches that may contribute time- and task-
dependent definitions of both nodes and systems.
Conclusions
The functional cartography of cognitive systems provides a new conceptual framework for
understanding the dynamic network integration and recruitment of cognitive systems in
enabling behavior, both during task and rest conditions. These methods allow for several ave-
nues of future inquiry, such as the investigation of the cartography for different task batteries
or at different spatial and temporal scales, as well as the investigation of individual variability
and its utility in understanding behavioral differences in healthy and patient populations.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (IRB
#0702094). All subjects gave written informed consent before the start of the experiment.
Participants
Fifteen participants (eight male, seven female) ranging in age from 19 to 29 years old
(mean = 22 years), voluntarily participated in this experiment. Participants were recruited
from the University of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area, and were excluded if they (i) had
any medical, neurological or psychiatric illness, (ii) had other contra-indications for MRI

scans, (iii) were non-native English speakers, or (iv) were left-handed. Results from unrelated
analyses of these data are reported elsewhere [24, 33].
Task Procedure
Subjects performed the permuted rule operations (PRO) task procedure [24, 33, 35], with task
instructions presented using E-Prime software [97]. This procedure combines three task fac-
tors, each with four possible levels, yielding a total of 64 distinct but related task combinations
(See Supplementary Information and S1 Fig for additional details).
In addition to ten experimental task runs (each 216 TRs in length), each scan session also
included one resting state scan (300 TRs in length), during which subjects were instructed to
keep their eyes open and focus on a fixation point on the screen.
MRI Data Collection
Magnetic resonance images were obtained at 3.0-T on a Siemens Trio MRI scanner.
T1-weighted structural images were collected using Siemens implementation of GRAPPA, in
order to double image acquisition speed. During experimental runs, blood-oxygenation level
dependent (BOLD) functional images were collected using an echo-planar pulse sequence
(time repetition [TR] = 2000 ms, echo time [TE] = 30 ms, flip angle = 90, voxel size = 3.2 mm
isotropic). Functional data were acquired at a field of view of 210 mm across 39 transaxial
slices.
fMRI Preprocessing
Preprocessing of functional data was performed using AFNI [98] and Freesurfer [99], and rest-
ing-state and task-state data were preprocessed identically in order to facilitate their compari-
son. Sinc-interpolation in time was performed to correct for the slice acquisition order, and
motion correction using least squares minimization was performed to correct for head motion
in the scanner. The resulting functional images were normalized to a Talairach template. Nui-
sance time series were removed (motion, ventricle and white matter signals, and their temporal
derivatives) using a General Linear Model, and spatial smoothing was performed in the gray
matter mask (6mm full width at half maximum). The average time series over the entire brain
(global signal) also had its contribution removed from the time series of each region, in an
effort to increase tissue sensitivity and reduce dependencies on motion [100]. However, given
current controversy in the literature [101], we also performed our analyses without global sig-
nal regression and observed qualitatively similar results (see Supplementary Materials). Finally,
Freesurfer was used to identify ventricle, white matter and gray matter anatomical structures
for each participant.
Functional Connectivity Estimation
Further analysis was carried out using custom code in MATLAB 2012b. In order to reduce the
dimensionality of the data and allow inferences at the region and systems levels, voxel-wise
functional data was resampled on a set of 264 brain regions comprising the cerebrum and cere-
bellum. The boundaries of the regions were defined using a combination of resting-state func-
tional connectivity parcellation [102] and task fMRI meta-analyses [13, 103] (See Supplement
for considerations regarding this choice of parcellation). The time course of each region was
obtained by averaging the signal from all voxels falling inside the region. The entire brain net-
work was also further subdivided at the system-level (subgraphs), where regions within a

system are more strongly connected to one another than to the rest of the network [13] (see
subsection entitled “Recruitment and Integration” below).
For the 64 task data, we regressed out each task event to suppress influences of shared stim-
ulus-locked activation on the estimation of functional connectivity. Specifically, we estimated
context-dependent connectivity using a linear model equivalent to the general linear model
(GLM) typically used in fMRI analysis, with one regressor for each task condition convolved
with a subject-specific hemodynamic response function. The residuals of this GLM were then
used for the estimation of functional connectivity, which involved the calculation of the Pear-
son product-moment correlation between residuals from each brain region, separately for each
task condition. These correlation coefficients were then Fisher-z-transformed to improve nor-
mality (See Supplement for an alternative method of removing task-effects using a Finite
Impulse Response model).
To keep the analyses of resting-state and task-state data consistent, the resting-state time-
series from each region was parsed into blocks of 11 TRs (the same approximate duration of a
mini-block in the task data), yielding 27 non-overlapping time bins. The Pearson product-
moment correlation was calculated between the time-series from each brain region separately
for each time bin, and the correlation coefficients were Fisher-z-transformed to improve nor-
mality (See Supplement for a discussion on the choice of window length).
The procedure was repeated for each subject and for each task condition (time-bin), yield-
ing, for each subject, a set of 64 task-state (and 27 rest-state) 264 × 264 functional connectivity
(or adjacency) matrices.
Multislice Community Detection
Common approaches to data clustering in networks are based on community detection tech-
niques [104, 105]. Here we use a generalized Louvain method [106] for optimizing modularity
[107] developed specifically for community detection in multislice systems [36]: systems in
which multiple networks (in our case drawn from task blocks) are to be examined at once. For
each set of FC matrices from each subject, we implemented a categorical multislice modularity
maximization [36, 108] which considers the multiple adjacency matrices as slices of a single
network, and imposes consistent node identity across slices by adding interslice connections
between each node and itself in every slice of the network. We then optimize the multislice
modularity quality Function (1), which uses the relative densities of intra-community connec-
tions versus inter-community connections to identify a partition of network nodes into com-
munities or modules [36], and which can be defined as:

stant (γs = γ, 8s and ωjsr = ω, 8j and 8s 6¼ r, meaning that node j in slice s connects to node j in
every slice r 6¼ s with weight ω). Respectively, these parameters control the size of communities
within a given layer and the number of communities discovered across layers. To choose values
for these parameters, we explored the parameter space by running 100 optimizations for each
combination of γ and ω, with both parameters varying between 0 and 10 in intervals of 0.05.
The speciﬁc parameters used in the main analyses (γ = 1 and ω = 0.45) were chosen so as to
maximize the variability of the ﬂexibility coefﬁcient across brain regions (see Supplementary
Information and S2–S4 Figs for a summary of the parameter exploration results). As in previ-
ous work [17, 18], we deﬁne ﬂexibility of a brain region as the proportion of task conditions in
which this region changes its community allegiance. The rationale for using this approach was
to enhance differences between nodes with regards to their degree of stability in community
allegiance, yielding brain regions that vary maximally between highly ﬂexible and highly stable.
The multislice community detection approach is a crucial part of our description of dynamic
roles of cognitive systems. It provides a data-driven clustering of regions into putative cognitive
systems that is more statistically robust than examining community structure at individual
times or in individual task windows, and provides sensitivity to a wide range of temporal scales
of importance in neuroimaging data. This multislice community detection procedure yielded,
for each subject, a set of 100 partitions for each of the 64 task (and 27 rest) conditions. In each
so-called ‘hard’ partition, each of the 264 nodes is assigned to precisely one community.
Recruitment and Integration
The multislice community detection procedure reduces the dimensionality of each subject’s data
from 264 × 264 × 64 to 264 × 64, where each brain region is assigned to one community in each
task condition. The dimensionality of the data can be further reduced by calculating a module
allegiance matrix P, a data-driven summary of the region-to-region (or node-to-node) interac-
tions across the entire task set. The entries of the module allegiance matrix, Pij, were calculated as
the percentage of tasks in which the pair of nodes i, j co-occur in the same community Eq (3):

We use the module allegiance matrix to assess the dynamic roles of cognitive systems during
task execution. We first define cognitive systems based on dense subgraphs previously identi-
fied from resting-state data [13]. To quantify the dynamic role of a region within one of these
systems, we use the module allegiance matrix to compute two coefficients: the dynamic net-
work recruitment and the dynamic network integration. The recruitment coefficient of region i
with respect to system S, RS

where nS is the size of system S, calculated as the number of regions in S. In other words, RS
i cor-
responds to the average probability that the ith brain region is in the same community as other
regions of the system S. A region with high recruitment to system S is one that tends to be
found in system S across many task conditions.

i corresponds to the average
probability that the ith brain region is in the same community as regions from systems other
than S. A region in system S with high integration is one that tends to be found in systems
other than its own across many task conditions.
Functional Cartography
While understanding the role of specific regions within the brain is useful, a coarser under-
standing of the roles of whole systems could provide compelling insights into how system
interactions are orchestrated during task execution. We therefore extend the definition of the
recruitment coefficient to an entire cognitive system by averaging the recruitment coefficients
for all regions within a system S:

A system that is highly recruited is one whose regions all tend to be placed in the same com-
munity throughout the full task battery. Similarly, we extend the definition of the integration

where N is the total number of brain regions. A system that is highly temporally integrated is
one whose regions tend to be placed in communities composed of regions from other systems

Given that the recruitment and integration coefficients are only weakly correlated at the
regional level (r = (262) = 0.31) and not significantly correlated at the systems level (r = 0.45,
p = 0.11), these two quantities provide complimentary information about cognitive systems.
We therefore use these two quantities in concert to provide a description of a system’s dynamic
role in the brain’s evolving functional network enabling cognitive performance; see Fig 1D.
This functional cartography is a representation that places each cognitive system on a 2-dimen-
sional plane whose dimensions correspond respectively to dynamic network recruitment and
dynamic network integration.

To interpret a system’s roles within this cartographic representation, we compare a system’s
placement to that expected in an appropriate null model that randomly permutes the corre-
spondence between node and system observed in the real data. In the null model, pseudo-sys-
tems (or non-systems) are formed as collections of nodes in the brain chosen uniformly at
random. More specifically, we created null partitions for each subject and task block that were
random permutations of the region-to-system assignments. This procedure ensured that the
number of systems and the sizes of systems in the null model were kept identical to those
observed in the real data.
A comparison of each coefficient value to its 95% confidence interval obtained from the null
model allows the identification of systems that have a lower, higher or indistinguishable
dynamic network recruitment and integration to a non-system. Thus, network roles can be
attributed to systems based on this comparison. Cognitive systems are classified as ephemeral if
they are less dynamically recruited (below 95% confidence interval), unstable if they are simi-
larly dynamically recruited (within 95% confidence interval), or stable if they are more dynami-
cally recruited (above 95% confidence interval) than the null model. Similarly, systems are
classified as loners if they are less dynamically integrated, connectors if they are similarly
dynamically integrated, or integrators if they are more dynamically integrated than the null
model. An illustration of all nine possible roles is shown in Fig 1D. (For a discussion regarding
the system definitions used here, see Supplement).

S7 Fig. Grid search over parameter space for the HCP 7-task data set. Parameter search in
the Human Connectome Project data set. Average and standard deviation of the flexibility,
average z-score of partition similarity across multilayer modularity maximization and across
tasks, average number of communities, and average partition quality Q, calculated for values of
the structural resolution parameter (γ) and interslice coupling parameter (ω) that vary between
0 and 1 in intervals of 0.1. We define the optimal combination of parameters as one in which
the standard deviation of the flexibility is maximal, with relatively high z-score of partition sim-
ilarity across multilayer modularity maximization and low z-score of partition similarity across
tasks.

S9 Fig. Removal of Task Effects Through a Finite Impulse Response model. (A) The func-
tional cartography during PRO-task execution with a subject-specific HRF estimated and
applied to remove residual task-effects prior to the calculation of functional connectivity. We
then utilized a 64-layer network with each layer corresponding to the functional connectivity
estimated in an individual task (see main manuscript). Each system is represented in a position
defined by its average recruitment and integration coefficients. Shaded areas define the signifi-
cant regions of the parameter space in comparison to a null model. (B) Functional cartography
during task execution with a Finite Impulse Response model applied to remove residual task-
effects. This approach aims to remove task effects by modeling the Hemodynamic Response
Function (HRF) independently at each brain region and separately for each task, allowing for
different shapes (amplitude and timing) of HRFs. The resulting cartography is obtained from
the dynamic functional connectivity analysis performed on the residuals of a General Linear
Model including nine regressors for each of the 12 task rules, for a total of 108 regressors.
