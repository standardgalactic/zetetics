Cookery is not only an art, but a master-art.

A THEN. Detp. vii. 5,
That charming student of humanity, Montaigne, who
was the favourite
author
of Shakespeare, and who
more than any other Frenchman has ‘coloured the
universal thought of the world,' might well at first
sigit appear
as the strongest
possible contrast
to
our modern
Savarin.
The
one
retiring
to
his
quaint
old Gascon
castle, in
a
wild
country,
still
remote from towns and highways, to
shut
himself
up for the latter half of his life with his books, and
.ponder on
his
great
theme, Uummi
nihil a me
ahennmjnao; the other, always a man of the world,

nothing if not genuinely French, and testing every-
thing hy the
Parisian
standards
: the
one, a
stoic
(in theory, at least), solitary, all his thoughts tinged
with
melancholy
;
the
other,
an
enthusiastic
Epicurean,
sociable, with an intense enjoyment
of
life.
Yet in one principal quality and most distinctive
feature they are
alike.
They are both
full of the
“ I ”—both
conscious
of
it
;
both
their works
are
steeped in subjectivity, and both owe to its presence
much of their charm.
Montaigne, indeed,
is him-
self the subject of his book
; and as to his opinion
on any matter, he gives
it, he
says, not as being a
good
one, but as being Ms.
Savarin, again, makes
no other excuse for the use of the “ me ” than the
garrulity
of age—a
plea which
is
unnecessary to
secure plenary indulgence from most of his readers.
They, like Balzac, find
that, while there
is nothing
more intolerable than the “ I ” of ordinary writers,
“ that of Brillât- Savarin is adorable.”
Indeed, it
is by the association of dissimilar ideas
that Montaigne comes to be mentioned here.
The
thought of Savarin, “the high-priest of gastronomy,”
with
his sometimes comic
affectation
of grandilo-
quence, at once suggested a caustic passage, in the
first
book
of
the
Essays, which
is aimed
at
the
‘ science de gueule,’ and especially at the pompous

tenns and
fine language used by an Italian cook in
discoursing thereupon, “with a magisterial solemnity
and
countenance, as
if he
had
been
discussing
a
weighty point
in theology.”
On
the
other
hand,
this incidental notice in Montaigne has much value
and significance here, as showing that three hundred
years ago the French were not only inferior to the
Italians in cookery, but could afford, they imagined,
to
smile
at the
technical terms and
scientific pre-
tensions of an art upon which they were afterwards
to specially plume themselves.
Cookery certainly held a very different
position
in the French mind when, during the peace
that
followed
Waterloo,
Brillat-Savarin
turned
his
thoughts
to
the
æsthetics
of
the
dining-table.
Culinary
art and
the
love
of good
living, which
îlontaigne
nicknamed
“ the
gullet-science,”
had
in the mean time
passed through
several phases;
the chief developments and refinements being under
Louis XIV., Louis XV., and the Regent.
During
the
first
of
those
reigns,
indeed,
cookery was
in
honour, not only with princes, but with such states-
men as
Colbert, such
soldiers
as the great Condé
and such persons of wit and culture as Madame de
Pévigné.
Many readers of that writer’s inimitable
letters will recall a graphic picture she gives of the
importance attached to the office and character of a

maître
dliôtel like Vatel,
not only
by
himself
or
Condé
his
master,
but
in
the
eyes
of
courtiers,
princes, and
even
the
king.
She
surrounds
the
death of Vatel with almost as much
of the heroic
as that of Tu renne.
Becoming
more
refined
and
also more popular
under Louis XV., as our author himself tells under
the heading “ Philosophical History,”
it was during
the Regency, and by the
s)'-stematic application of
the chemistry of the
period, that gastronomy
first
had any claim to rank as a science.
Surviving the violence and
social
distractions of
the Revolution and the First Empire, gastronomic
art acquired new vigour in France
after Waterloo,
under the active patronage of Louis XVIII., and to
the
admiration
of
our
appreciative
author.
Xo
doubt
this
powerful
reaction
in
favour
of
his
favourite study, occurring during those last years of
his life, first suggested
to Savarin the propriety of
setting down in order his thoughts and
conclusions
upon an
art which had become so important that
Lady Morgan, describing the France of that period,
calls it “the standard and gauge of modern civiliza-
tion.”
Savarin’s qualifications for this task are abundantly
proved by
his performance
of
it.
His whole
life
was a preparation
;
and
throughout
his work we

find himself
and
his
subject
indissolubly welded
together.
All his varied
experience, whether
pro-
fessional, political, or as a man
of the world, is ran-
sacked
for
illustrations, and every country he has
visited is laid under contribution.
Yet such
is his
artistic
instinct, that
there
is no personal
allusion
but fits in naturally with the
subject.
The various
threads of individuality are
so interwoven with the
general tissue, that the result is a complete and har-
monious whole.
His native place was
the small town
Belley, in
the Rhone valley at the foot of the Alps
; and there
are many
illustrations drawn from that country or
its people.
Other recollections
suitable to his sub-
ject
are
derived
from
his
escape
to
Switzerland
during
the Reign
of
Terror,
as
well
as
from
an
adventurous
journey previously made
to
secure a
“safe-conduct.”
The
latter
occasion
brought
his
Epicurean nature into
strong
relief ;
for
althougli
his head
was
at
stake,
he
not
only
“snatched a
fearful joy ” by making
a hearty dinner with some
chance companions
at a
country-inn, and
singing
thorn
a song made
for the occasion, but spent the
evening with enthusiastic
delight
in the company
of the dread
representative who
had just refused
the all-important document.
Other allusions are to
Holland, to London (including, of course, Leicester

XU
BRILLA T-BA VARIK
Square) and the English, and more frequently and
fully to the United States.
Paris, however, naturally
outweighs
all the rest
;
like a true Frenchman, the
m
brilliant capital is for him everything— the world in
little.
Again, his professional and
social
position amply
provided
Savarin
with
opportunities
of
studying
French gastronomy.
His family had for generations
been barristers and magistrates, and he himself com-
menced life as an advocate with such distinction that,
at the age of thirty-four, in 1789, he was elected one
of the members of the Constituent Assembly.
After
sharing in the legislative labours of that historical
body, he became successively President of the Civil
Tribunal of the Department de TAin, and one of the
judges
of
the
important Cour de
Cassation, then
newly instituted.
This
last high
office he filled so
worthily that, after the Eeign of Terror and an exile
of
three
years,
spent
principally
in
the
United
States of America, he was again made judge in that
court, and continued
so, under
the Directory, the
Consulate, the Empire, and
the Eestoration, until
his death in 1820.
Thus we
find Savarin
sitting at banquets given
by
the highest
functionaries—witness
his
picture
of the awful
effects
of uupunctuality at the house
of Cambacérès, where he was invited to dinner—
a

Xlll
table of such importance that Napoleon
utilized
it
for State purposes.
Savarin also refers to Talleyrand
as
a worthy
gastronome
; and en revanche
one
of
the
few
personal
traits
of
Savarin
not
told
by
himself
is due
to that distinguished
friend.
The
story
is,
moreover, valuable
as
a
proof
of
the
hereditary
quality
of
taste
and
genius.
Savarin,
halting one day
at Sens, when on his way to Lyons,
sent, according
to
his
invariable
custom,
for
the
cook, and
asked what
he
could have
for
dinner.
“ Little enough,” was the
reply.
“ But let us see,”
retorted
Savarin
;
“ let us go into the kitchen and
talk the matter over.”
There he found four turkeys
roasting.
“ Why
! ”
exclaimed
he,
“ you
told me
you had nothing in the house
!
let me have one
of
these turkeys.”
“ Impossible!” said the cook; “ they
are all bespoken by a gentleman
upstairs.”
“ He
must have a large party
to dine with him, then ? ”
“No; he
dines by himself.”
“Indeed!”
said the
gastronome
; “ I should like much to be acquainted
with the man who orders four turkeys
for
his own
eating.”
The cook was sure the gentleman would
be glad of his acquaintance
; and Savarin, on going
to pay his respects to the stranger, found him
to be
no
other than
his own
son.
“What! you
rascal!
four
turkeys
all
to
yourself!”
“Yes,
sir,”
said
Savarin
junior; “you know that when we have
a

turkey at home you always reserve for yourself the
parso7i’s
nose:
I was resolved to regale myself for
once
in my
life
; and here
I am, ready
to
begin,
altliough
I
did
not
expect
the
honour
of
your
company.” *
The “ Physiologie du Goût ” was published within
a year of Savarin’s death, yet he was
gratified by
seeing his work crowned with extraordinary success,
speedily becoming (to use a phrase of Balzac’s) the
veritable
decalogue
of
gastronomers—irrefragable
as
the
laws
of
Kepler.
Its
success
is
certainly
largely due to the beauty
of the
style, and to the
original yet charming manner of the author.
There
are not only the clearness and elegance and felicity
which are impressed on all good French writing, but
his
style
is
also so
cheerful and picturesque that
it
positively smiles;
one
comic
charm being the
grand
importance
which
he
affects
to attach
to
his
subject.
Had
Savarin
lived
and
written
in
the
country
of
Walton’s
“Angler,”
or
White’s
“ Selbourne,”
“ the
Physiologie du
Goût ” would
certainly have again and again pleasantly occupied
the learned
leisure of admiring commentators, and
given
occasion
for many
ingenious
notes and
ex-
haustive
illustrations, biographical and antiquarian
* A similar story is told of TyaReyniero, a celebrated gastronome
of the last century.—(See Littré, under Sox.}

as
well
as
gastrological.
The
French,
however,
do
not
distinguish
their
favourite
authors
in
the
same way; nor does there appear
to be any French
edition of the “ Physiologie du Goût ” with notes.
The present attempt to present Brillat-Savarin in
Fnglish
dress is due to a statement made
last year
in “Notes and Queries,”
to the effect that a trans-
lation
was and
had long been
a decided want
in
English
libraries.
The
notes
inserted
here
and
there by the translator will be easily distinguished
from
those of the French text—either intrinsically
or by
the
latter being
always marked
by
single
inverted commas.

DlALOaUE
BETWEEN
THE AUTHOR AND HIS FRIEND*
Friend.
This morning, at
breakfast, my wife and
I liave in our wisdom decided that your “ Thoughts
on
Gastronomy ”
must
be
printed
as
soon
as
possible.
Author. What woman
wills, God
wills.
In that
single sentence is summed up
all
the ethics of the
Parisians.
But I am under a different jurisdiction;

F.
Good heavens!
The
bachelors are
as much
under the rule as other men, as we know sometimes
* Tins conversation is by no means merely imaginary.
So
real,
indeed, is the
cliaracter of tho
friend,
that
his “ biograi)hy,”
oc-
cui)ying several pages, was originally appended
to
this dialogue.
It is now omitted, as being decidedly a hor» d'œuvre too many.

only too well
!
But
in
this case you
can’t get
off
on the score
of bachelorship
;
for my wife declares
that she can
insist upon
it,
because
it was
while
visiting her in the country that you wrote the first
pages of your book.
A. My dear
fellow, you know very
well how
I
respect the ladies
; more than once you have praised
my submission
to their commands, and, like some
others, you used to say I should make an excellent
husband.
Yet,
for
all
that,
I
shall
not
get
it
printed.
F. And why ?
A.
Because,
after
a
professional
life
of
earnest
work, I am
afraid
of being thought a mere
trifler
by jieople reading only the title of my book.
F. How absurd
!
As if thirty-six years of public
and uninterrupted
duties had not
established
for
you
a
character
quite
the
opposite
!
Besides, we
believe, my wife and
I, that everybody will wish to
read you.
A.
Really?
F.
The learned will read you in order to discover
what you have always been hinting at.
A.
That is quite possible.
F.
The women
will
read you because they
will
easily see that

A.
Spare my feelings, my dear friend
;
I am now
old and full of wisdom,
F. Men fond of good living will read yon, because
yon do them
justice, and
so their proper rank
in
society
is at last assigned to them.
A.
In that instance you are certainly right. Who
would
believe
that
those
honest gentlemen could
have been
so
long
misunderstood
!
I
look upon
them with
all the feelings of a father—such hand-
some, bright-eyed fellows
!
F.
Besides, have you not often told us that such
a work as yours was needed in our libraries ?
A.
I have said so, and
it
is the
fact.
I will not
swerve a jot from that opinion, but stick to it like a
mastiff.
F. Why, you
talk
like
a man whose mind
is
quite made up
;
so let us go together and see
A.
No, no
!
If authorship
has
its
pleasures,
it
has also its thorns
; and I leave the whole
business,
as a legacy, to my heirs,
F.
But, in the mean time, you wrong your friends,
acquaintances, and contemporaries.
Do you mean
to say you can do such a thing ?
A. My
heirs
! you
forget them
!
I have
hoard
say that the shades of the departed generally derive
pleasure from the praises of the living.
It is a sort

of beatitude
that
I wish
to keep
in
store
for the
other world.
F.
But
what
certainty
have
you
that
those
praises
will
be
bestowed
in
the
proper
quarter ?
Are you
certain of the care and
diligence of your
heirs ?
A.
Well,
I have no
grounds
for thinking that
they would neglect
this one duty, since on account
of
it they will be excused many others.
F. Would
they, could
they, have
for your book
that
father’s
atfection,
those
author’s
attentions,
without which a work always makes its
first public
appearance awkwardly ?
A.
*I shall leave the manuscript corrected, fairly
copied
out, and fully equipped, with nothing to do
but print
it.
F. What about the chapter of accidents ?
’Tis
arrangements
of that
sort,
alas
!
that have ruined
many
valuable
works
;
such
as
that
of
the
dis-
tinguished Le Cat, on the “ State of the Soul during
Sleep ”—the labour of a lifetime.
A.
That certainly was a great
loss, and
I by no
means liope to occasion similar regrets.
F.
Be sure of this—that, in settling matters with
the Church, the lawyers, the faculty, and with each
other, heirs have quite enough on their hands
; and

that there would not be time, even if there were the
inclination, to give full attention to all the manifold
details
connected with
the
publication
of even
a
small book.
A.
But the title
!
The subject
!
And what about
ill-natured wags of critics ?
F.
At the single word
“ gastronomy” every one
pricks up his ears
:
it is quite the rage.
And as for
the waggish critics, they are
as fond
of good living
as other men.
So
set your mind perfectly at ease.
Besides, you
surely know
that
personages
of the
greatest weight have sometimes produced light and
amusing works.
Montesquieu is an instance.
A. (eagerhj). Upon my word, you are right
!
He
wrote the “ Temple
of Gnidus ”
; and there would
surely be more real advantage in the study of that
which is every day the want, the
pleasure, and the
occupation of man, than in telling us what was done
or said, more than two thousand years ago, by two
youngsters
chasing
each
other
through
Grecian
groves.
F.
You give in, then, at last?
A.
I give in
!
Not at all.
What you have heard
is but
a
touch
of nature
betraying the author
; *
* Perhaps
tlio
original
phrase
liere, “ to show the
tips of his
ears,” is worth noting.
It is eurionsly liorrowed from tlio fable ol

skin,

to
betray

which
recalls
to my mind
a scene
in
an
English
comedy that once greatly amused me.
It occurs in
a piece
called
“ The Natural Daughter,”
I think,
and I should like to have your opinion upon
it.
Some Quakers are introduced
; a class of men who,
as you know, of course, “ thee ” and “ thou ” every-
body, wear clothes of the simplest kind, never serve
as soldiers, never swear—even in a court of law,— do
everything
with
a
dull
gravity, and
in
particular
must never put themselves in a passion.
Well, the
hero of the piece is a handsome young Quaker, who,
in
spite
of
the
brown
coat,
large, broad-brimmed
hat, and straight hair with which he appears on the
stage, falls deeply
in
love.
Accordingly, a puppy
of a rival takes courage from that appearance and
demeanour, and
so makes
fun
of him and
insults
him, that the young man, getting gradually heated
with anger, at
last becomes
furious, and gives the
coxcomb a thorough thrashing.
That punishment bestowed, he instantly recovers
his former demeanour, and collects himself, exclaim-
ing
in
a
penitential
tone, “ Alas
!
thou
seest
that
the flesh has prevailed over the spirit.”
I now
do
as
he
did
;
and,
after
a
display
of
pardonable feeling, come back to my former opinion.
F.
It
is
too
late now.
As you yourself admit,
you have betrayed your real mind on the matter.

bave now a bold upon you, and you must come off
to the publishers’.
I may even
tell you
that the
secret of your book has not been kept by all who
knew
it.
A.
Don’t be
too
rash, my dear
boy, for
I
shall
have something
to
say about
yourself ;
and who
knows what that may be ?
F. What
could
you
say on
that
topic?
You
needn’t think you can frighten me.
A.
I shall not tell how our common * native-place
boasts
of
having
given
you
birth
;
nor
how,
at
twenty-four, you published a work which has
since
held a place
in the foremost rank
; nor how, by a
well-deserved
reputation,
you now command
the
confidence of all
; how your
patients
take courage
from your manner, admire your skill, and
are con-
soled by
your
sympathy.
I
shall
not
tell
Avhat
everybody knows, but
I
shall
discover to
all Paris
(rising up), to
all France
(throiving
his head
hack),
to the whole world, the only fault
in you which I
know of!
F. (seriously). Which fault, if you please ?
*
‘ Bclley, tho
chief town
of Bugey, a
lovely
country,
with
mountains and hillocks, rivers and limpid brooks, waterfalls and
deep pools
;
a regular jardin anrjlais of a hundred square leagues
in size.
In this country, before tho Bevolution, the constitution of
society was such that tho third estate was really tho governing
class.’

fault, which all my exhortations
have failed to correct.

it at once.

For
tiie publication
of tbe work now entrusted to
the reader’s good will, there was needed on my part
no great labour.
All I have done was to arrange a
collection
of materials made
long
ago.
It
was
a
pastime which I had been keeping in store for my
old age.
Whilst
considering
the
pleasures
of
the
table
from every point of view, I soon saw that there was
something better to be made of the subject than a
mere cookery-book, and that there was much to be
said upon functions which
are not only
vital and
constant, but exercise a very direct influence upon
our health, our happiness, and even our success
in
life.
As soon as this leading idea was clearly fixed
in
my mind, all the rest flowed easily from
it.
I looked
about me—I took notes
: and often in the midst of

the most
sumptuous banquets
I should have
felt
bored but for my amusement as an observer.
To complete the task which I had taken on my-
self, one must have been physician, chemist, physio-
logist,
and
even
somewhat
of
a
scholar.
Those
different
subjects, however,
I had
studied without
the slightest intention of becoming an author, being
urged on by a praiseworthy curiosity, by the fear of
being
left behind the age, and by the wish
to be
able to converse on equal terms with men of science
and learning, in whose company I have always taken
a special pleasure.*
More particularly, I am an amateur doctor.
It
is
quite
a passion
with me
; and amongst
the
finest
days
of my
life I reckon that on which I entered
with the
professors, and
by
their
door,
into
the
lecture-room where the prize essay was to be read,
and
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
a murmur
of
curiosity
run
through
the audience,
each
student
asking
his
neighbour
what mighty
professor
the
stranger might be who was honouring the assembly
by his presence.

Como and dine with me next Thursday,” said Jh Greffublo
to me one day, “ and I’ll have a party of men of science or men of

‘ “ IMy choice is made,” said
I, “ wo
shall dine together twice
instead of once.”
‘ W’o did
so, sure enough
; and the
literary dinner was unmis-
takably more refined and well-ordered.’

There
is, however, one other clay the memory of
which
is
equally
dear
;
that, namely, on which
I
presented
to
the Council
of
the “ Society
for
the
Encouragement of National Industry” my “irrorator,”
an instrument of my invention, which
is simply a
compression-fountain,
adapted
for
the
purpose
of
perfuming rooms.
I had brought, in my pocket, my machine
fully
charged.
I
turned
the
cock,
and
there
escaped,
with
a
hissing
sound, a perfumed vapour, which,
rising
to
the
ceiling,
fell
in
tiny drops upon
the
persons and papers beneath.
It was then that, with
inexpressible delight, I saw the most learned heads
of the capital bend under my “ irroration,” and I was
in
ecstacies on observing that the wettest were the
happiest.
Occasionally, in thinking of the weighty lucubra-
tions to which the extent of my subject has drawn
me, I have had an honest fear lest I might bore the
reader
;
for
I myself have sometimes yawned over
other people’s books.
I have done everything
in my power
to avoid
blame on this score.
I have touched but lightly on
the
subjects
likely
to
bo
dull
;
I have
scattered
anecdotes over the book—some drawn from my per-
sonal experience
;
I have thrown aside a great many
singular facts, from a regard to sound criticism.
I

have aroused attention by giving a clear and simple
account of certain scientific truths which the learned
seemed to have reserved for themselves.
If, in spite
of so many
efforts, my readers should
still find the
science difficult of digestion, my peaee of mind will
not be
in
the
slightest degree
disturbed,
because
I am sure
that the majority
will acquit me as to
intention.
I might also be charged with letting my pen run
on
too
fast, and becoming somewhat garrulous
in
my stories.
Is it my fault that I am an old man ?
Is it my fault that I am like Ulysses, who had seen
the manners and cities of many peoples ?
Am I to
blame for giving a
little of my biography?
In a
word, the reader ought to give me credit for making
him
a present of my “Memoirs
as a Public Man,”
which
deserve
to
be
read
quite
as much
as
so
many others,
since for thirty-six years
I have had
the
best opportunity
of watching society and the
course of events.
Above all things, let no one rank me amongst the
compilers.
Before being reduced to such straits, my
pen would have
been thrown
aside,
and
I should
have lived quite as happily.
Like Juvenal, I have said:

being familiar both with tbe turmoil of city life and
the silence of the study, the best thing I could do
was to make the most of both positions.
After
all, there
is much
of the book which has
been written for my own gratification.
I have men-
tioned
some
of my
friends who
scarcely expected
such
a
thing;
I
have
recalled
several
pleasant
recollections,
and
noted
down much
that
would
otherwise have been forgotten.
In a word, I have
given full vent to my humour.
Amongst those readers who are fond of lengthen-
ing out a story, there will probably be one to exclaim,
“ I should
like much to know
if
,”
or “ What
does he mean by saying that
,” and
so
forth.
But the
rest, I am confident, will
tell him to hold
his tongue
;
and every such expression
of natural
feeling
will
be
kindly
received
by
an
immense
majority of my readers.
I have still something to say about my style,
for,
to quote Buffon, “ As the style
is,
so
is the man."
And
let no one think I am about to ask a favour,
never granted to those who need
it
:
I only mean to
make a simple explanation.
I
ought
to
write
admirably,
for my
favourite
authors have been Voltaire, Jean-Jacques, Fénelon,
Buffon, and, more recently. Cochin and Aguesseau,
and
I
know them by
heart.
The gods, however.

may have ordained otherwise
; and if so, the follow-
ing reasons explain that will of the gods.
Knowing
five living languages well, or tolerably,
I
possess a huge
repertory
of words
of
all com-
plexions
; and whenever an expression
is needed,
if
I
don’t find it in the French pigeon-hole, I take
it
out of one of the
others.
Hence the necessity for
my
reader
of
either
translating or guessing;
the
Fates leave him no alternative.
I am firmly persuaded that the French vocabu-
lary
is
comparatively
poor.
What,
then, was
left
for me
to do ?
To borrow or
steal.
I have done
both
;
because such loans need not be
paid back,
and stealing words is not punishable by law.*
I fully expect that the stern
critics
will loudly
appeal to Bossuet, Fénélon, Eacine, Boileau, Pascal
and others of our masters
in
style.
I fancy I
al-
ready
hear
their frightful
din, and therefore give
them my reply, calmly, that I am far from denying
the merit of those
authors, whether named or
re-
ferred to
;
but, what then ?
The only inference
is,
that having done good work with indiffèrent tools,
* Some of the words borrowed or stolen by Savarin are siroter

to

they
would
have
clone
incomparably
better with
good
tools.
In
the same way everybody
believes
that
Tartini
would
have
played
the
violin
still
better had his bow been as long as that of Baillot,
I
must
be
classed,
then, with
the
writers who
employ new
words,
if
not
even
with
those who
throw
off
all
allegiance
to
classical
style
and
models.*
The
latter
discover
hidden
treasures,
while the
others
are
like
sailors, who bring from
afar the provisions w'hich we need.
The Northern races, especially the English, have
in
this
respect
an
immense
advantage
over
us.
The genius of their language is never hampered by
rules of style
;
it creates or borrows.
Accordingly,
* The
term, un
romantique, according
to
the French
philo-
logists, was introduced by Madame de
Staël,
all modern
writers
being by her divided into two classes :
les
classiques, who follow
the
models
already
established,
and
les
romantiques, who
act
independently of classical
style and standards.
Thus, in recent
times,
Victor Hugo
is pre-eminently un romantique — not
only
ignoring the dramatic unities and other canons sacred to Corneille
and Voltaire, but
actually and enthusiastically admiring such a
barbarian as Shakespeare.
The same terms have
also been used in classifying the great
masters in French gastronomy
;
Bcauvilliers, for example (after-
wards
referred
to
fully
in
the
ehaptor
on
restaurants),
being
ranked at tho head of
tlie classical school.
This implied analogy
between
cookery and
literature may remind
tho
philosophical
render of a passage
in
one of Dugald Stewart’s “Essays,” where
the effects of “ sweet ” and “ bitter ” in gastronomic art are said to
correspond to that composite beauty which it is the object of tho
painter and of tho poet to create.”

in
all subjects treated with depth and energy, our
translations
are
mere
copies,
without
colour
and
expression.
I remember once hearing, at the Institute, a well-
written discourse to show the danger of using new
words,
and the
necessity
of holding
fast
by
the
language fixed for us by the writers of the classical
age.
As a chemist, I tested this philosopher’s stone
by my retort, with the following result
: “We have
done so well, that it is impossible to do better, or to
do otherwise.”
Now, I have lived long enough to know that each
generation says the same
thing, and
is laughed at
for
its pains by the generation following.
Besides,
why should words
not change, when manners and
opinions
are
constantly undergoing
modifications?
Even if we do the same things as the ancients did,
we
do them
in
a
different manner
; and
in some
modern books
there
are whole pages which
could
be translated into neither Latin nor Greek.
All the languages have their birth, their culmina-
tion, and their decline
; and of those that have shone
since the time of Sesostris to that of Philip Augus-
tus, not one exists as a living tongue.
The French
language will have the same
fiite
; and in the year
2825, 1 shall be read only with the
assistance of a
dictionary, if indeed I be read at all.

I
conclude
the
preface by a remark
which, on
account
of
its
importance,
I have
been
reserving.
When
I
say
“ I ” or
“ me ”
it shows I am talking
familiarly, and the reader
is at liberty
to examine,
dispute, doubt, or even laugh
; but when I arm my-
self with the terrible “ we,” it is to speak authorita-
tively, ex cathedra, and the reader has no choice but
submission.

ON THE SENSES.
The
senses are the organs by which man and the
outer world are brought into communication.
The

of
the

Thus,
Littré, one of Comte’s principal

sense
of taste we
appreciate
whatever
is sapid
or
eatable.
The sense of touch informs us about the
surfaces
of
bodies
and
their
consistence.
The
genetic,
or generative, sense has
for
its object the
reproduction of the species.
It
is astonishing
that the
last
of
these should
not have been recognized before the time of Buffon
;
being
either confounded with the
sense
of touch,
or regarded
as a mere adjunct
or modification
of
it.
But, as
for the
preservation
of the individual
there
is
one
sense—taste,
so
the
other
is
as
cer-
tainly a
sense appropriated
to
the preservation of
the species.

that
is
to
say, that he saw without precision, heard

and,
in
his
enjoyments
generally,
lived as a mere animal.
But, all our perceptions having as their common

race, and
ever tending
to greater perfection—they
are there subjected
to

Thus, touch
corrected
the
errors
of
sight;
the
hearing, by means
of the spoken word, became the
interpreter of what man thought
;
taste was assisted
by sight and smell
; and hearing compared sounds
and measured distances.
The
stream
of
time,
rolling
over
successive
generations
of men,
has
incessantly
brought new
improvements
; and this tendency to
perfection, so
real though unobserved, is due to the action of the
senses,
and
their
constant
demand
for
healthy
exercise.
Thus, sight has given birth to painting, sculpture,
and
every kind
of
show
or pageant
;
hearing,
to
melody, harmony, dancing, and all that is connected
with music
;
smell, to the search and observation of
perfumes, their use and culture
; the sense of taste,
to
the
production,
selection,
and
preparation
of
every kind
of food
; the
sense of touch, to
all the
arts, all
the
skilful
trades, and
all the
industries
;
the
genetic
sense,
to romantic
love,
flirtation, and
fashion, to
all
that
adorns
the
relations
between
man
and woman
or
aesthetically

directly by the
natural demand
of
the

Those

so dear to

at the other end
of the
scale, have
with
time both gained additional powers in a w-onderful
degree.
Thus,
the
weakness
of
old
age,
which
affects most of the
senses, is,
in the case
of sight,
almost
entirely remedied
by
the
use
of
glasses.
The
telescope
has
discovered
stars
formerly
un-
known, because inaccessible to unaided
vision ; and
the
microscope
has
led man
to
see,
for the
first
time,
the
composition
and
constitution
of
sub-
stances, showing us plants and a mode of growth
whose very existence
were previously unsuspected.
Some
animalcules
are
shown which
are
the
one-
hundred-thousandth
part
of the
smallest
creature
visible
to the naked eye;
yet
they move
about,
feed, and reproduce, proving that there are organs
so minute
tliat the imagination
can
form no con-
ception of them.

unapproacliable.
By skill and mechanism, man has
subdued all nature, making it subservient to
all his
wants, his pleasures, and his caprices, and changing
the whole
surface
of
the
globe.
Thus
a
feeble
biped is become king of all creation.
Senses
of
sight
and
touch
of
such
enlarged
powers might rank among the attributes of a
race
much
superior
to man
;
or
rather,
were
all
our
senses improved
in
like proportion, mankind would
be quite a different species.
It should be
noted, however, that although
the
sense
of
touch
has
developed
enormously
as
a
muscular power, yet, as a
sensitive
organ, scarcely
anything has been done for it by advancing civiliza-
tion.
But we must not
despair, remembering
that
the human race
is
still young, and that
it
is only
after
a
long
series
of
ages
that
the
senses
can
enlarge
their
sphere
of action.
Thus,
it
is
only
about four centuries since men discovered harmony,
a
science
all
divine, bearing
to sounds
the same
relation as painting does to colours.*
No doubt the
ancients
sung
airs
and
melodies
with
musical
accompaniments,

‘ If tho ancients
understood harmony, their
writings would
have preserved soino more certain proof than a few vague phrases.
It is to the Arabs we are indebted
for

idea of concords and harmonies.’

further
; they
could
neither
analyse the notes nor
find their relations to each other.
It was not till the fifteenth century that the laws
of
tone, and
rules
for
the movement
of
concords
were
ascertained.
Then,
accordingly,
musicians
first made
use
of theory to
sustain the
parts and
improve the
expression.
That
discovery,
so
late
and yet so natural, showed the duality of the sense
of hearing
; that in one organ there are two facul-
ties, to some extent independent of each other—the
one
perceiving the sound
of the
notes, the
other
estimating their resonance or length.
Some German
doctors say that the perception of harmony consti-
tutes an additional sense.
As to those
for whom music
is
only a confused
mass
of
sounds,
it should be
observed
that they
nearly
all sing out
of tune
; and they must have
either the
ears so formed as to receive only short,
abrupt vibrations, or one ear attuned to a
different
key from the other, and therefore jointly transmit-
ting to the brain only a vague and ill-defined sensa-
tion—^just
as two instruments which
agree neither
in time nor tune are incapable of together sounding
harmoniously.
During these last ages, the sense of taste has
also
largely extended its sphere of influence
; and by tlie
discovery of sugar and
its various
preparations, of

alcoholic liquors, of ices, vanilla, tea, and cofiee, we
have a knowledge of tastes and flavours which were
previously unknown.
Who
can
say
that the
sense
of touch
will not
have its turn, and that some happy chance may not
in this quarter also disclose
to us a source of new
modes
of enjoyment?
What makes
it the more
probable
is, that
the
tactile
sensibility
is confined
to no special part, and can therefore be acted upon
throughout the whole body.
In
one
respect,
taste
resembles
the
genetic
sense.
As

so

II.
ON THE SENSE OF
TxVSTE.
Taste
is that
sense which, by means of a special
orsan, brings man into contact with sapid ^
substances.
After being stimulated by the
of this
appetite, hunger and thirst, this sensation,
when combined with several subordinate operations,
results
in
the
growth,
development, and
preser-
vation of the individual, at the same time making
good the losses due to the vital functions.
All
organized bodies
are not nourished
in
the
same
manner;
for
Nature,
being
as
varied
in
methods
as
she
is

assigned

modes
of
prolonging
existence.

living
beings,
are
fed
by means of
roots,
which,
sinking
into
the
native
soil,
select, by a special
apparatus, the
different
substances
suited
for
the
purposes of growth and preservation.
Rising higher, we discover bodies endowed with
animal
life, but without the
power
of locomotion.
Born with
favourable
surroundings, they are
pro-
vided with the special organs necessary to maintam
that mode
of existence.
Instead
of
seeking
for
their food, the food comes to find them.
For
animals
who move
from
place
to
place.
Nature
has
appointed
quite
a
different means
of
preservation, and
especially for man, who
is incon-
testably the most perfect.
A
special instinct tells
him when he requires
to be fed ; he looks
for and
seizes whatever seems likely
to appease his wants
;
he eats, and becoming restored, thus runs through
the destined career of life.
Taste can be considered under
three
aspects
:
in
man, physically,
as
the mechanism
by which
he
appreciates the sapid quality or flavour of substances
;
in man, morally,
as the mental perception due
to
the sensation or impression made on the organ
; and
lastly,
in the external body,
or
objectively,
as the
material property to which we ascribe the sensation
or impression made on the organ.
This sense seems to have two principal uses.
First,

it
invites us, by
the
pleasure, to repair the
losses
which we constantly
suffer from the action of
life.
Secondly,
amongst
the
different
substances
pre-
sented to us by
nature, taste
assists
us
to choose
those which are
fit to serve for food.
In making this choice, we are greatly assisted by
the sense of smell,
as we shall
see further on
;
for,
as a general rule, nutritive substances are repulsive
neither to the sense of taste, nor that of smell.
It
is
not
easy
to
determine
precisely
what
parts constitute the organ
of taste.
It

pears.
The tongue, of course, plays an imjDortant part in
the action of tasting,
since
it
is by
it that the food
is moistened, turned about, and swallowed.
IMore-
over, by means of the papillæ scattered over
its sur-
face, it drinks in the sapid and soluble
particles of
those bodies with which it comes in contact.
That, however, being insufficient, several adjacent
parts
assist
in completing
this
sensation
:
to
wit,
the palate,
the
sides
of the mouth, and especially
the
nasal
passage—a
part
to which
physiologists
have not directed
sufficient attention.
From the
sides of the mouth
is supplied the
saliva, necessary
for mastication and
deglutition
; and
they, as
well
as
the
palate, assist
in the appreciative faculty

taste.
It is probable that, in certain cases, the gums
have a
slight share in the
tasting
sensation
;
and
without a certain appreciation of flavour at the root
of
the
tongue,
the
sensation
of
taste
would
be
deadened and imperfect.
Those who are born without a tongue, or have had
it cut
out,
still
retain the sense of
taste.
Of the
former case, there are instances in the books written
on such matters; and the
latter was explained
to
me by a poor fellow whose tongue had been cut out
by
the
Algerians,
because, with some of his com-
panions
in
captivity,
he
had
formed
a
plan
for
escaping and running away.
This man, whom I had
met
in Amsterdam, where he gained a
living by
running errands, had had some education, and it was
easy
to
converse
with him
by means
of
writing.
After noticing that
all the
fore part of his tongue
was removed down to the ligament, I asked
if, after
undergoing
so
cruel an
operation,
there
still
re-
mained
a flavour
in
what he
ate,
or any sensa-
tion
of
taste.
He
replied
that
what
he
found
most
difficult
was
to
swallow
;
that
his
sense
of
taste remained pretty
well the same, and that he
could tell, like other men, what had little taste and
what was pleasant, but that strong acids, or anything
very bitter, caused him intolerable pain.
I
also
learned from
him, that in
some
African

ON THE SENSE OF TASTE.
1

kino’doms
it
was
a common
thins’
to cut out
the
tongue,
especially
as
a
punishment
for
the
ring-
leaders
of
conspiracies.
He
said,
also,
that
there
were
special instruments
for the purpose, which
I
wished him
to
describe
;
but the
rej)ugnance
he
showed was so painful that I did not press him.
Reflecting on what he told me, and going back to
those dark ages
w'hen the tongues of blasphemers
were pierced
or cut
out,
I became convinced that
such a custom
of law must have been
of African
origin, imported to Europe by the Crusaders.
We have
seen above that the sensation of taste
resides
principally
in
the
papillæ of
the
tongue.
But by anatomy we learn that these are so unequally
supplied, that one tongue may have thrice as many
as
another.
Hence
one
explanation
why,
of two
guests seated at the same banquet, one has delicious
sensations, whilst the
other seems
to eat only be-
cause compelled
;
the reason being
that the latter
has
a tongue
only poorly furnished for enjoyment.
Thus
the
empire
of
taste
also has
its blind men
and its deaf.
There have been
broached
five
or
six
opinions
as to the operation of the sensation of taste.
gcnsaUnn
I
have
also
mine,
and
it
is
as
follows
:
the sensation of taste is a chemical
result obtained,
as we have already said, through moisture
;
that

to
say, the sapid
molecules must be
dissolved
iu
some
fluid,
that
they may be
absorbed
by
the
minute
tufts
of nerves,
papillæ
or
suckers,
which
cover the surfaces of the organ.
Whether new
or
not,
this
theory
rests
upon
physical facts which are almost self-evident.
Pure
water
causes no
sensation
of taste, because
it con-
tains no
sapid
particles
;
dissolve
in
it a grain
of
salt or a few drops of vinegar, the sensation imme-
diately takes place.
Other drinks, again, affect the
sense because they are nothing hut solutions more
or
less charged with molecules that can be
tasted.
Then, by an insoluble body, even
if the mouth were
filled with
its particles minutely divided, the sense
of touch alone would he affected, and that of taste
not at all.
As to solid bodies which have taste, they must be
comminuted by
the
teeth, impregnated
with
the
saliva
and
other
gustatory
juices,
and
pressed
against
the
palate by the tongue
till the juice
so
yielded makes a favourable impression upon the gus-
tatory papillæ, and the triturated body receives from
them the passport necessary to enter the stomach.
IMy theory, which is to be still further developed,
gives an easy
explanation
of
the
principal
diffi-
culties.
Thus, if you ask what
is meant by a sapid
body, I reply
:
It
is one which is soluble and
fit to

be absorbed by the organ of taste.
If
it
is asbed
bow a sapid body acts, the answer is
:
It acts when-
ever it IS so dissolved that it can entei those cavities
whose function is to receive and transmit the sensa-
tion
of taste.
In a word, nothing
is
sapid
unless
already dissolved or easily soluble.
The number of tastes perceived in objects is infi-
nite, since every soluble body has a special

all others.
Flavours
receive
additional
modifications
of
infinite variety, ranging from the most attractive to
the
most
intolerable, from
the
strawberry
to
the
colocynth; and
all attempts
to
classify them may
be termed
failures.
Nor
is this to be wondered at
;
for, granted
that
there
are undetermined
series
of
simple flavours which can be modified by combining
them in any number and quantity, we should require
a new language to express all these results, mountains
of folio volumes to define them, and newly devised
numerical characters to classify and member them.
Since, up to the present time, no taste or flavour
has, as a sensation, been rigorously defined, men are
compelled
to keep
to
a
small number
of
general
terms, such as “ sweet,”
“ sugary,”
“ sour,” “ bitter,”
and
so
on;
and, on
further
analysis, these
can be
classified under the two heads of “ agreeable to the

or
“ disagreeable.”
They
suffice, however,
to make
one’s
self
understood, and
indicate with
tolerable exactness the gustatory properties
of any
sapid substances about which one is talking.
Those
who
come
a-fter

will
know
more
about
such
qualities,
and
it
seems
already
certain
that
chemistry
will
discover

them
the
causes

;
for,
of
all
the
writers
that
have
come
under my notice, none appear to have done
it

and entire justice.
For my own part, I am not only convinced that
there is no complete perception of taste
unless the
sense of smell have a share in the
sensation, but I
am further tempted to believe that smell and taste
form only one sense, having the mouth as laboratory

exactly, the one serves to taste solids, and the other
gases.
This theory can be supported by strict reasoning
;
but
as
I have no
intention
of founding
a
sect,
I
merely launch
it forth
to make my readers
reflect,
and
to show
that

subject of my work.
At present, I proceed to prove
the importance of the sense
of smell, if not as an
integral part of that of taste, at least as a necessary
assistant.
Every sapid body
is
necessarily
odorous, which
gives it a place under the sway of one sense exactly
as under that of the other.
Nothing
is eaten with-
out being smelt more or less attentively
; and when
any unknown food is presented, the nose always acts
as
sentinel
of
the advance
guard, and
calls
out,
“ Who goes there ? ”
To
intercept
the
smell
is to
paralyse the
taste.
This
I
prove
by
three experiments, which
every-
body can verify
: first, when the mucous membrane
of
the
nostrils
is
irrigated
by
a
severe
cold
in
the head
all
sense
of taste
is obliterated, and no
flavour
is perceived
in anything that
is swallowed,
though
the
tongue
retains
its
normal
condition
;
second, if you hold your nose when eating, you will
be
surprised
to
find
that the sensation
of
taste
is
extremely dull and
imperfect
:
hence a means
of
getting down
the most nauseous medicines almost
without
perceiving
it
;
third,
the
same
result
is
observed
if the tongue
is kept
close to the palate
at the moment of swallowing, instead
of letting
it
resume
its
natural
position;
for the

that

is
therefore
paralysed.
These
different results
are due to the same cause
—the absence of smell as a fellow-worker
;
for thus
the sapid body
is sensible only by
its juices, and
not by the odorous gas which it exhales.

of this theory, let us consider
what takes place during eating and drinking.
He
who

it yields

Finally,

that, by the very act of eating, we
are making

losses, and prolonging

found
more
fully
developed
future chapter, where the “ pleasures of the table ”
are treated from a modern point of view, especially
as
affected
by the
civilization
of
the
nineteenth
century.
We have been brought up in the fond belief that,

ON TEE SENSE OF TASTE.
23
of
all the animals
that
walk, swim,
climb,
or
fly,
man
has
the
sense
of
taste
the
most
perfect.
Now, however, there are threats macy of
that this faith will
be shaken,
for Doctor
Gall maintains, as the result of some investigations,
I know not what, that there are animals which have
the
organs
of
taste more
highly
developed
and
more perfect than those of man.
This doctrine of his sounds badly, and smacks of
heresy.
Man, by divine right king of
all creation,
and
for whose
benefit the
earth
was
covered and
peopled, must necessarily be provided with organs
of taste which can adequately appreciate all that
is
sapid amongst his
subjects.
The tongue of animals
is analogous to the reach
of their intelligence.
In fishes, it is only a movable
bone
;
in
birds,
it
is
generally a membranous
car-
tilage
;
in
quadrupeds,
besides
being
frequently
covered with scales or
asperities, it has no power of
circumflex movement.
Tire tongue of man, on the contrary, by the deli-
cacy of its structure, and of the different membranes
which surround or lie near
it, gives sufficient indica-
tion of the high functions for which
it
is destined.
Moreover, I have discovered three movements in
it
unknown
to
animals
;
and
I
distinguish them by
the terms
“ spication,” « rotation,” and “ verrition.”

24
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
The
first occurs when
the tongue
is
pressed
in a
conical shape between the lips
; the second, when it
moves
circularly
in
the
space
bounded
by
the
cheeks and palate
; and the
third, from the Latin
verro, I sweep, when
it bends back, either above or
below,
to
gather anything which remains
in
the
semi-circular space outside the gums.
Animals
are limited
in
their
tastes
: one living
only on
vegetables
;
a second eating nothing but
flesh
;
a
third
feeding
exclusively on
grain
; and
none of them know compound
flavours.
Man, on
the
contrary,
is
omnivorous
;
everything
that
is
eatable
is
subject
to
his
all-embracing
appetite.
Hence, as
a necessary inference, his
tasting powers
must in extent and variety be proportionately great
;
and, in fact, in man the mechanism of that particular
organ
is of a rare
perfection.
To be convinced of
this, let us look at it in operation.
As soon as anything esculent enters the mouth, it
is irretrievably
confiscated, with
all
its juices and
gases.
The
lips
prevent
it
from
returning,
the
teeth take hold of it and crush
it, the saliva absorbs
it, the tongue mixes it and turns it round, an aspira-
tory compression
forces
it towards
the
gullet, the
tongue
rises
to make
it
glide down—the
sense
of
smell then taking note of
it, and finally it falls into
the stomach, to be there subjected to further changes

25
of form.
Yet,
during
all that
operation,
there
is
not a single portion, drop, or atom, that has escaped
the testing and appreciating power of the organ.
Another result of that organic
perfection
is that
epicurism, or the art of Good Living, belongs to man
exclusively.
By a sort of contagion, however, it is
transferred to those animals which are appropriated
to man’s use
and,
in
a
certain
sense, become
his
companions
; such as the dog, the
cat, the elephant
and even the parrot.
If
some
animals
have
the
tongue
larger,
the
palate
more

and
the

it
cannot be therefore inferred by any rules of sound
logic that their sense
of taste is more perfect
; the
tongue is larger because
it has to act as a muscle to
move
large
weights, the
palate
to
press, and the
gullet
to
swallow,
larger
portions.
Besides,
since
taste should be judged by the perceptions
it gives
rise
to,
as
already
explained, any
impression
re-
ceived by animals cannot be compared
with
that
experienced by man
; the latter
is of greater clear-
ness and precision, and must therefore be of greater
excellence.
In a word, is
it
possible
to desire any improve-
ment in a faculty so refined that among the ancient
Romans the epicures were wont, by
taste
alone, to
tell if a fish had been caught above or below bridge ?

Do we not see some of our own time who, in eating
a partridge, can
tell by its flavour which leg it has
slept upon ?
And have we not amongst us connois-
seurs who can
tell under what
latitude a wine has
ripened, with
as
great a certainty as a disciple of
Biot or Arago can predict an eclipse ?
What,
then,
is the
inference?
That we
must
render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, by pro-
claiming man the epicure
of nature; and
that we
must
not

that,

But the task imposed on us does not end
here, since it is from
its history in a moral point of
view that this restoring sense derives its importance
and
its
glory.
We
have
therefore
arranged
in
logical order the body of theories and facts of which
that
history
is composed, with the view
of being
instructive without being tiresome.

perfected
their

and extended

how the

for

a

instinct,
has
become a prevailing passion which has
a marked
influence on all that
relates to our social life.
We
shall trace the

of
chemistry up
to the
moment
when,
entering
our
laboratories

ground, she throws light upon our food-preparation,
lays down
principles, devises methods, and unveils
the causes of what formerly lay hid in mystery.
In
short, we
shall
see
how, by
the
combined
influence of time and experience, there has appeared
all at once a new science, which nourishes, restores,
and
preserves man, advises and consoles him, and,
not
satisfied with strewing
flowers
along
his path
with an ample hand, also increases powerfully the
might and prosperity of empires.
If, in the midst of such weighty disquisitions, a
pointed
or humorous
story, a pleasant
recollection,
or some
adventure
from
a
life
of many ups and
downs should be on the tip of the pen, we shall let
it drop, in order
to relieve
for a moment the atten-
tion of our readers.

At
last,
however,
though perhaps
too
late, men of science
no
longer
kept
aloof.
They examined, analysed,
and
classified the
alimentary
substances,
and
re-
duced them
to
their simpler
eonstituents.
They
fathomed the mysteries of assimilation, and
tracing
inert matter through
its changes of form, saw how
it became endowed with
life.
They have
studied
food
in
its
effects, whether momentary
or perma-
nent, for days, for months, or even for a whole
life-
time.
They have estimated even its influence upon
the
faculty
of thought, whether the
soul
receives
impressions from the senses, or can perceive without
the
concurrence
of those
organs.
Finally,
as the
result of all these labours, they have formed a grand
generalization,
embracing
all
mankind,
and
all
matter that is capable of assimilation.
Whilst the men of science were thus employed in
the study, the man of fashion began to exclaim that
the science by which we are kept in life must surely
be worth more than that which teaches men to

Sucli were
tlie circumstances preceding
the
ad-

Gastronomy

of mankind,
and
it
attains that end by laying down
certain
principles
to

in
the

of
alimentary substances.
j
Thus to
it, as the
efficient cause, we must ascribe

the
labours
of
farmers,
vine-growers,
fishermen,
,
huntsmen, and
especially of cooks of every degree,
whatever be the
title
or
qualification under whicli
they may disguise their occupation of preparing food.
Gastronomy
is
related

its

It

of assembled
kings, and
also
counts

The material subject which gastronomy treats of
is
everything
that
can
be
eaten;
its immediate
object is the preservation of the individual
; and the
means by which
it

its purpose are

thing can be best turned to account.
Gastronomy

It
also
considers how
food may
influence
the
moral nature of man, his imagination, his mind, his
reason,
his
courage
and
his
perceptions, whether
awake or asleep, whether in action or repose.

It
is gastronomy, moreover, that by
classifying
those
substances according
to
their various quali-
ties, shows which should go together
; and from a
comparison
of
their
properties

dis-
tinguishes those which should form the
basis of a
repast from mere accessories, as well
as from others
which, though by
no means indispensable, yet
fill
up the time
agreeably, and assist the after-dinner
chat.
With
regard
to
what
we
drink
at
table,
gastronomy
is
equally
interested,
classifying
ac-
cording
to
age,
country, and
climate.
It
teaches
how the wines are prepared and kept, but especially
how to put them on the table in such an order as to
produce
for
the
guests
an
enjoyment
constantly
increasing up to the point where pleasure ends and
abuse begins.

Another duty of gastronomy
is to pass men and
things under
review,
with
the view
of conveying
from
country
to

that
deserves being
known.
Thus a
skilfully arranged banquet shows
you the world in miniature, every part having some
representative.

so much
so, that
it
is
indispensable to
all
who have
a large income and
receive much com-
pany—whether they do
so to play a part, to please
themselves,
or to be in the
fashion.
There
is
this
special advantage, that they must personally have
some share
in the arrangements
of the
table, and
in
superintending
or
giving
directions
to
those
entrusted with the management and preparation.
The
Prince
of
Soubise,
wishing
one
day
to
celebrate
a
fête, which
was
to
finish
off
with
a
supper, gave orders that the
bill of fare should be
shown him beforehand.
Next morning, at his
levee,
the
steward made
his
appearance
with
the docu-
ment
handsomely ornamented, and
the
first
item
which
caught
the
eye
of
the
Prince
was,
“fifty
hams,”
“Hullo, Bertrand!” said he; “you must be

“Bertrand,
you
are

! ”
“ Ah,
monseigneur,”
said
the
artiste,
scarcely
able
to
restrain his anger,
“ you
don’t know our resources.
Give the
order, and those
fifty hams which annoy
you, I shall put them into a glass bottle no bigger
than my thumb.”
What reply could
be made
to
an
assertion
so
positive ?
The
Prince
smiled, nodded
assent, and
so the item passed.

Inttre,

This same Prince de Soubise (like Bcchameil, the ma'dre d'hôtel
of Louis
the Magnificent, and Robert, one
of the Parisian gas-
tronomic masters)
is as “surely destined
to immortality by
his

Our author has a reference to it in the Varieties at the
end of this work.

That
fact has been taken notice of by some who
frequently deal with matters of the highest interest.
They saw that a man with a good bellyful was very
different from a fasting man
;
that the table formed
a
sort of common ground between hosts and guests,
rendering
the
latter
more
susceptible
to
certain
impressions and influences.
Hence
arose
political
gastronomy, by which banquets become a means of
government,
and
frequently
decide
the
fate
of
nations.
The
previous
observation
is
by
no
means
a
novelty, much less a paradox.
Open any historian,
from Herodotus
to
the most
recent, and you
will
see how it was always at banquets that great events
of
every kind,
including
even
conspiracies,
have
been first thought of, planned and determined upon.

This monitor
is the appetite, by which we mean
the
first
feeling
of a
desire
to
eat.
Appetite an-
nounces itself by a slight sensation of languor in the
stomach, and
general
fatigue.
The mind,
at
the
same
time, is occupied with ideas analogous to
its
wants
;
the memory
recalls
things which
pleased
the
taste
;
the imagination seems
actually
to
see
them—the
whole
state being a sort
of dream, yet
not devoid of a certain charm. We have a thousand
times heard skilled gastronomes exclaim, in the joy
of their hearts, “ What a pleasure
it
is
to have
a
good appetite, when one
is certain of soon having
an excellent dinner
! ”
Soon,
however,
the
whole
alimentary
system
shares
in
the
commotion
;
the
stomach
feels
strongly
;
the
gastric
juices
and
gases
become
active
;
the mouth
fills
with
juices, and
all
the
digestive
powers
are
in arms,
like
soldiers
ready
for action, waiting only for the word of command.
These various
states, in all stages, can be seen
in
any drawing-room where the guests are kept w'aiting
for dinner.
So inherent, indeed, are they in man’s
nature, that their symptoms cannot be disguised by
the most refined politeness.
Hence, I have gathered
the maxim
that. Of all
the
qualities
of a
cooh,
the
most indispensable is punctuality.

39
To
support
this
grave
apoplitliegm,
I
shall
re-
late what
I have
myself
seen
at
a dinner party,
Quorum pars magna fui,
where my amusement as an observer saved me from
much of the anguish which others underwent.
One day I received an
invitation
to dine with a
high
public
functionary, and
at
the

had
arrived,
for
it
was known
that
he
liked
punctuality,
and
sometimes
scolded
those
who were
late.
I was
struck, on my
arrival, by
the
air
of
consternation
that
seemed
to
reign
amongst
the company
:
they
whispered
to
each
other
;
they looked out
into
the courtyard
; some
faces indicated
stupefaction
: something
extraordi-
nary had certainly happened.
Going up
to one
of the guests, whom I thought
most
likely
to
satisfy my
curiosity,
I asked him
what the matter was.
“ Alas
! ”
replied
he,
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
sorrow,
“monseigneur
has
been
sent
for
to
the
Council
of
State
;
he
is
only
starting,
and who
knows when he will be back ? ”
“ Is that
all ? ” said I, with an air of carelessness
very different from my
real
feelings
; “ it is only a
matter of a quarter
of an hour—some information
which they require
:
it is well known that an official

40

dinner
is given here
to-day, and they can’t intend
to make ns
fast.”
I spoke
thus, though my
real
sentiments were those of anxiety, and I would fain
have been somewhere else.
We
got
over
the
first hour
pretty
well.
Men
who had
interests
in common
sat together; every
commonplace
topic
was
exhausted
;
and
some
amused
themselves
with
conjectures
as
to
the
reason of our favourite Amphitryon being summoned
to the Tuileries.
At the second hour, you could perceive symptoms
of
impatience;
each
looked
anxiously
at
his
neighbour, and the
first
to
utter
complaint were
three or four guests who had not found
seats, and
were
therefore
in a
rather uncomfortable
position
for waiting.
At
the
third
hour,
the
dissatisfaction
became
general, and everybody grumbled.
“ When will he
come back ? ”
said
one.
“ What does he mean ? ”
said another.
“ It will be the death of some of us,”
said a third.
At
the
fourth
hour,
all
the
symptoms
were
aggravated
: some stretched
their arms at the
risk
of knocking out
their neighbours’ eyes
;
there was
yawning not only seen but heard all over the room
;
every
face
showed
marks
of
intensified
feeling.
Nobody listened
to me when I ventured to say that

he whose absence made
us wretched was no doubt
the most wretched of
all.
Our attention was
for a moment diverted by an
apparition.
One
of
the
guests, better acquainted
Avith the house than the
rest of
us, had found
his
way
to the
kitchens, and noAV returned
breathless.
His face announced that the end of the world was
at hand, as, in an
inarticulate
voice, and with that
muffled tone which expresses at the same time the
fear of speaking loud and the
desire
to be
heard,
he exclaimed, “ Monseigneur left the house without
giving any orders, and however long his absence be,
dinner will not be served till his return.”
He spoke, and the alarm which
his speech
oc-
casioned will not be exceeded by the effect
of the
trumpet
on
the
day
of judgment.
Amongst
all
those martyrs,
the
most

was

Aigrefeuille was an intimate friend and companion of Cam-
bacérès, the leading statesman under Napoleon,
at whose house,
therefore,
this
incident must be assumed to have occurred.
So
important
were
the dinners
at the Arch-Chancelloi’’s,
that
the
Emperor is said to have generally expressed his
satisfaction with
a conference of diplomatists and plenipotentiaries by the formula,
“Go and dine with Cambacérès.”
A bond of connection between Carnbacérè.s and our author may

every part of his body, and the agony of Laocoon
was in bis face.
Pale, wild-looking, seeing nothing,
he had assumed a crouching
position
in
an
easy-
chair, with
his
little hands crossed upon his large
belly, and his eyes closed, not to sleep, but to wait
the approach of death.
It came
not,
however.
About
ten
o’clock,
a
carriage was heard
in the
court-yard.
Everybody
rose up by a spontaneous movement.
Gaiety took
the
place
of
dejection,
and
in
five
minutes we
were at table.
But the time of appetite was
past.
The guests
had an air of wonder at so unseasonable a dinner

several
of the

In cases of that sort, the proper course to pursue
is
to
eat

after
the
forced abstinence, but
to
swallow
a
glass
of some
light
drink,
or a small

for
two
or
three
guests,
and
the
huge
portions
served
to
each, we
are compelled
to
believe that
during the infancy of the world men were endowed
with greater
appetites.
According
to
the dignity
of
the
personage,
his
appetite was
considered
to
increase
in
a
fixed
proportion
;
and
he who
was
served with a whole baron of five-year-old beef, had
no choice but
to drink from a goblet such
as he
could scarcely lift.
More recently, also, there have appeared some
as
a testimony
of what was
possible
long
ago
; and
there are many examples
on
record
of a voracity
almost incredible, and sometimes, indeed, including
the most unlikely objects.
Sparing my readers any
such details, I
prefer
to relate two actual instances
from my own experience, which do not require on
their part any great effort of faith.
Some forty years ago, I went to pay a flying visit
to the
vicar
of Bregnier,
a man
of great
stature,
and known throughout the district
for his power of
eating.
Though
scarcely
midday,
I
found him
already
at
table
; the
soup had been removed,
as
well as the meat boiled in
it, and these two regular
dishes had been
followed by a leg of mutton à
la
Royale, a fine capon, and a large bowl of salad.
On seeing me, he ordered anotlier knife and
forlc,
which I declined
; and it was well I did so, for alone,

44
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
and without any assistance, he quite
easily got
rid
of everything, leaving
of the mutton nothing hut
the
bone, of the capon
nothing
but the
skeleton,
and
of
the
salad
nothing
hut
the
bowl.
Next
they brought a cheese
of considerable
size, and
in
it he made an angular breach
of ninety degrees
;
the whole
being
washed
down
with
a
bottle
of
wine and a decanter
of
water,
he
then
went
to
have his forty winks.
One- thing which delighted me was, that during
the whole
of this performance, lasting nearly three
quarters of an hour, the venerable
pastor did
not
at
all seem too much engrossed in
his work.
The
huge
pieces
Avhich
he
threw
into
his
capacious
mouth
prevented
him
neither
from
talking
nor
laughing, and he despatched all that was put before
him with
as little
effort as if he had only eaten a
couple of larks.
In
the
same
way
General
Bisson,
who
drank
eight bottles of wine every day at breakfast, never
seemed
to
he
doing
anything
of
the
sort.
His
glass was larger than the others, and he emptied
it
oftcner; but you would have
said
that he did
it
without any
effort, and,
whilst thus imbibing
his
sixteen pints, ho could as freely join in pleasant chat
or give his orders as
if he had only drunk a single
bottle.

ON TEE APPETITE.
45
That
second
instance reminds me of my fellow-
townsman, the gallant General Sibuet, who was long
chief
aide-de-camp
of
Massena, and
died
on
the
field of honour at the passage of the Bober in 1813.
At the age
of
eighteen, Prosper had
that happy
appetite by which Nature announces her
intention
of
completing
a
well-developed
man,
when
one
evening he entered Genin’s dining-rooms, where the
worthies of the place usually met to
eat chestnuts
over
a
bottle
of
the
white
wine
there
called
“ cross-grain.”
A superb turkey had just been taken off the spit,
a
fine
bird, handsome, golden, done
to
a
turn, and
scenting
the room enough
to tempt a
saint.
The
village worthies, not being hungry, took very little
notice of
it
; but
the
digestive
powers
of
young
Prosper were stirred within him, and with his mouth
watering, he
cried, “I have only just had
dinner,
yet
I’ll
lay a
bet
to
eat that
big
tui-key
all by
myself.”
“ Done
! ”
replied
Bouvier
du Bouchet, a
stout
farmer who happened to be
in the room
;
“ if you’ll
eat
it, 1 11 pay for you
; but
if you come to a halt,
then you’ll pay and I’ll eat the rest.”
Instantly
setting
to
work,
the
young
athlete

skilfully and swallowed
it

mouthfuls:

taking a glass of wine as an interlude, by crunching
the neck of the fowl.
Next he attacked the thigh,
and
after
eating
it with
the same
self-possession,
took a second glass of wine to clear the way for the
remainder.
Very
soon
the second wdng went
the
same road, and on
its disappearance, the performer,
as keen as ever, was taking hold of the only remain-
ing
limb, when the unfortunate farmer shouted, in
a doleful tone, “ Ah
! I see very well you’ll win
; but
as
I have
to pay, leave me at least a small
bit to

afterwards
showed himself courageous, and not only consented
to his opponent’s request, who thus had for his share
the carcase of the fowl, still in excellent condition,
but
paid cheerfully
both
for the turkey and
the
necessary accompaniments.
General
Sibuet
was very
fond
of
quoting
this
youthful exploit, and used to say that it was merely

he
took
the

ON FOOD.
What
is meant by food ?
The
popular meaning
is, whatever
yields
us
nourishment
;
the
defini-
scientific, any substance
Avhich, on being
submitted
to
the
action
of
the stomach, becomes
assimilated
by
digestion,
and
repairs
the
losses
which, from
vital use and
action, the human body
suffers.
Thus, the
distinctive
quality
of
food
is
that it can be assimilated by an animal.
It
is from
the animal and vegetable kingdoms
only
that
man
has
hitherto
derived
his
food.
IMinerals have
as
yet
yielded only medicines and
poisons.
Since analytical chemistry was classed among the
real
sciences,
great
advances
have
been
chemical
made
in gaining
insight
into the
consti-
analysis,
tuent
elements
of
the human
body,
as compared
with
those
of
the
substances
evidently
intended
by nature
to
repair
its
losses.
Between these two
branches of study
there must be

analogy.

since man’s body
is in a great measure made np of
the same elements as the animals he feeds upon, and
in vegetables we must look
for the affinities which
render them capable of assimilation by animals.
I had some
intention
of here
inserting
a
short
treatise on the chemistry of foods, and showing my
readers
into
how
many
thousandths
of
carbon,
hydrogen, etc., we could reduce them and the dishes
on
which
they
feed
;
but
I
have
refrained,
on
reflecting
that such a task would merely be equi-
valent to making a copy of the excellent chemical
treatises which
are
already
in
everybody’s
hand.
Moreover, I was afraid of becoming involved in dry
details, and have accordingly limited myself to the
use
of
systematic
terms—except, here and
there,
where some chemical results are stated in words less
bristling and more intelligible.
The greatest service which chemistiy has rendered

exact definition, rather, of osmazome.
Osmazome
is
that
specially sapid
part
of meat
which
is soluble
in
cold water, and
therefore to be
distinguished from the “ essence,” wliich
is soluble
only in boiling water.
It
is osmazome which con-
stitutes the real merit of good soups
; which, passing
into a state resembling caramel, gives meat its red-
dish tinge
; which forms the crisp brown on roasts
;

49
and 'which
yields a
flavour
to
venison and game.
Osmazome
is
derived
principally from
full grown
animals, with reddish or dark
flesh, such
as some
call
fully
formed
;
and
it
is scarcely ever found
in
veal, sucking-pigs, pullets, or even the best fed
capons.
This
explains, by the way, why your real
connoisseur
has
always,
in
poultry,
preferred
the
inner thigh
;
his taste had instinctively anticipated
science.
By a similar unconscious anticipation of this dis-
covery, we can
explain
the
dismissal of
so many
cooks
for
having
abstracted
the
first
soups ;
the
reputation
of the “soupes de primes”; the use of
a bason of broth as a restorative after bathing
; and
Canon Chevrier’s invention of having a padlock on
the stock-pot.
It was
this canon, by the by, who

it had
been
cooked on the Sunday, and
daily

placed on

fire

It was also in order to prevent any waste of this
substance, though
yet
unknown,
that
the maxim
arose
: To make good soup, the pot must only simmer

as
the
phrase
is
;
and

tipsy before distillation brought

light.
After
osmazome comes
the product obtained by treating
meat with boiling water, and generally termed the
extract or essence
; when combined with osmazome,
it forms the juice, or gravy.

To
carve
well,
the
blade
of
the
knife
should be
at
right angles to the
fibre, because thus the meat not
only looks
better, but
tastes
better, and
is more
easily chewed.
Bones
consist
principally of gelatine and phos-
phate of
lime.
The gelatine diminishes
as
one’s
age increases, so that at sixty the bones are merely
a kind of imperfect marble.
Hence their brittleness
in old men, and the rule of prudence which warns
them
to avoid
every chance
of
a
fall.
Gelatine
occurs in the soft parts as well as in bone and carti-
lage.
Its
special
property
is
coagulation
at the
ordinary temperature of
the
air;
as when infused
in water, in so small a proportion as two and a half
per
cent.
It forms the basis of every kind of jelly,
blanc-mange, and similar preparations.
Albumen
is found both in the flesh and the blood.

ON FOOD.
51
It coagulates at a lower temperature than 104° Fah-
renheit, and forms the scum on soups.
Blood
is composed
of albuminous serum,
fibrine,
and a small quantity of gelatine and of osmazome
;
it
coagulates
in
hot
water,
so
forming
that most
nourishing article of food, the black-pudding.
All the elementary constituents now passed under
review
are common
to man
and
the
animals on
which he
feeds.
We need
not wonder, then, that
animal food has eminently restorative and strength-
ening
qualities
;
for
its
particles, having
already
been
assimilated,

easily become
assimilated
anew under the action of our digerdive organs.

is highly nutritious, being the basis
of

By
starch

the

hand, upon nearly all the domestic animals starchy
food seems to have a strengthening influence, because
it is more substantial than their ordinary vegetable
food.
Sugar
is equally important, both
as food and as
medicine.
Formerly attributed only to the Indies
and
distant
colonies, it has recently been found to
be
a native
of our own country, being traced and
discovered
in
the
grape, the
turnip, the
chestnut,
and, more particularly, the beet-root
; so that Europe
might
actually,
in
this
respect, dispense
with the
services of America and Hindostan,
We shall have
to speak more
fully
of this
important product
in
the following chapter.
Whether as a solid, or in its natural state as found
in
different
plants,
sugar
is
extremely
nutritious.
Animals
are fond of
it
; and the English, who
fre-
quently
give
it
to
their
favourite
horses,
have
observed
that
thus
they
can
stand
better
their
different
trials of exertion.
Formerly only sold by
apothecaries,
it has
in modern times given
rise
to
various lucrative occupations, such as confectioners,
liqueur-sellers, and other dealers in sweetmeats.
Tire
oils
derived from
the vegetable kingdom,
and
used
for
food,
are
so used
in
virtue
of
the
substances with which they are in combination, and
should be regarded principally as a seasoning.

Gluten, which
is
derived more
especially from
corn, assists powerfully in the fermentation of bread,
and some chemists have even assigned
to
it some
property akin
to
life.
In Paris there
is a kind of
cakes made
to
contain much
gluten,
part of
the
starch being removed by means of water.
They are
used for children and birds.
Other
nutritious
products
of

are

which
perhaps
explains
the
reputation
formerly
enjoyed
by
certain
religious
orders
who
used
a
regimen quite opposed to the weakest of their vows.
I shall say no more on this physiological
question,
except
to
mention
a
fact
the
truth of which can easily be verified.
Some years ago, I went to call at a house in the
suburbs
of
Paris,
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
Seine, opposite the island of
St. Denis.
There was
a
small hamlet
of about
eight
or
ten
fishermen’s
huts, and being amazed at the numbers of children
that I saw swarming on the road, I expressed my
surprise to the boatman who was rowing me across.
“ There
are only eight
families of us here,
sir,”
said
he, “and we have
fifty-three children—forty-
nine girls and only four boys
; and my son there
is
one
of the
four.”
As
he
spoke,
he held up
his
head proudly, and pointed to a
little monkey, five
or six years
old, who
sat
at the bows of the boat
crunching some raw cray-fish.
This observation, made more than ten years ago,
and others that I could easily give, induced me to
believe that the genetic properties of a fish diet are
due
to it as an
excitant merely—a doctrine that
I
maintain
all the more stoutly
since Doctor Bailly
has proved, as the result of observations made
for
nearly a century,
that when

births the number of girls
is notably greater than
that
of the
boys, the excess
is
invariably
due
to
debilitating circumstances.
This may also explain
some of those staple jokes with which people rally a
man when his wife is brought to bed of a daughter.*
Much might still be said on alimentary substances,
both
generally and
in
detail;
but the preceding
will, I trust,
suffice
for the majority of my readers.
The others I refer to the professional
treatises, and,
meantime, close with a remark of some importance.
In
a
living
organism,
we
have
results
quite
different from those obtained in abstract chemistry,
because
the
organs
intended
to produce
life and
movement
exercise
a
strong
influence
upon
the
elementary
substances
submitted
to
them.
But
nature, who
takes pleasure
in veiling
herself, and
stopping us
at the second
or third
step, has com-
pletely
concealed
her
chemical
transformations
;
and
it is
really impossible to explain how, given a
human body containing lime, sulphur, phosphorus,
iron, and a dozen other substances besides, the whole
can nevertheless be, for several years, kept up and
renewed with nothing but bread and water.
* Some
diligent
enquiry and
discreet
consultation
of
wise
matrons have been rewarded by finding a survival
of
Snvarin’s
saying in our English folk-lore. On the occurrence of the domestic
event
referred
to
in
the
text, some smiling dame Quickly, or a
merry nurse like Juliet’s, will shrewdly remark that “ this time ho
was not mau enough.”

In

elementary
works on

Hence,

what
I

remains a few elementary principles, some theories
which
cannot be
too widely known, and a few ob-
servations— the
fruit
of a lengthened
experience,
and still, I trust, new to most of my readers.

To have good

the water must be
heated
geutly, in order
to draw out the albumen before it
is
coagulated,
and
the

must
be
almost
imperceptible,
in
order
to
mix
thoroughly
and
gradually the soluble parts which the meat succes-
sively
yields.
Sometimes vegetables
or

to

and macaroni or bread to make it more nourishing

It
is generally admitted that nowhere
is better

to be had than
in France, and
in my travels
I have seen the truth of the statement confirmed.
Nor
need
the

Avondered
at;
for,

The beef used
in making the
soup
is
healthy,
satisfying, and easily enough digested, but
does
not
give
much
strength,
because
t>cef, &c.
during the boiling much of the assimilative juices
has been lost.
In fact,
it is a rule of housekeeping
that beef loses a half of
its weight when
boiled

first,
the men
of

eat
it
because their forefathers ate
it, and hope, from their
implicit submission to the practice, to be

tated by their children
; secondly, impatient guests,
who must be doing something
at
table, and have
therefore contracted the habit
of throwing
them-
selves without
hesitation upon whatever is first laid
before them
;
thirdly, men without
discrimination,
who, not having
received from heaven
the
sacred
fire, look upon dining as a mere task, put
all kinds
of food on the same level, and at table are like so
many
oysters
on

fourthly, the
gluttons,
who, wishing
to conceal
their capacity for swallow-

their stomachs whatever
comes
first,
to
serve
as a
victim
to
appease
the
devouring
fire within, and form a basis for
all that
is to be sent the same way.

Some of those who wish always to be better
informed than
their
neighbours,
tell
us
that the
turkey was known to the Romans, that it was served
up
at the marriage-feast of Charlemagne, and that
therefore it is out of the question to give the Jesuits
the credit of this savoury importation.
To meet those paradoxes, there were two objec-
tions
:
first, the name “ Coq-dTnde,” or “ dindon,”
which is a proof of its origin, since formerly, America
was
called the “West Indies;” second, its
shape,
which
is evidently quite foreign.
No man able to
judge could be mistaken as to the fact
;
yet, though
thoroughly
convinced,
I
have made
considerable
researches
on
the
matter,
and
now
present
the
reader with the results, as follows
:
The turkey first appeared in Europe towards the
end of the seventeenth century.
Second, it was im-
])orted by the Jesuits, who reared them in great nxim-
bcrs, and especially at a farm belonging to them in
the suburbs of Bourges.
Third, they spread thence

Fourtli, America is tlie only
place where the wild turkey has been found.
Fifth,
on the North American farms, where it is very com-
mon, it is got, either by taking the eggs and getting
them hatched, or by catching the young birds in the
woods and taming them
; one result of which is, that
they more nearly resemble the wild turkey.
Convinced by
these
proofs,
I
retain
a
double
feeling of gratitude
to those holy fathers
;
for they
also imported cinchona—the “ Jesuit’s bark ” of the
English.
By the same researches, I find that the turkey is
gradually becoming acclimatized in France.

During my
stay
at
Plartford
in Connecticut,
I
liad the good
fortune to
kill a wild
tur- a personal
key.
That exploit deserves to he handed
exploit,
down to
posterity, and
I
shall
tell
it
all the more
complacently that I am myself the hero.
An old American farmer, who lived in the back-
woods, invited me to a day’s shooting, promising me
partridges, grey
squirrels, and
wild
turkeys.
He
told me, also,
if I
liked, to bring a friend
or two
with me.
Accordingly, on
a
fine October day
in 1794, we
set out, my friend King and I, mounted on hacks, in
the hope of reaching, about dusk, Mr. Bulow’s farm,
situated about
fifteen mortal miles from Hartford.
King was a sportsman of rather a peculiar sort
;
for,
although passionately fond of the
exercise, he had
no sooner killed a bird or beast, than he looked upon
himself as a murderer, and made moral and elegiac
reflections on the fate of the
defunct.
This, how-
ever, did not prevent him from beginning again.
Though
the road was
a mere
track, we arrived
safely, and were
received
with
that
heaidy
unob-
trusive
hospitality which
is shown by acts
:
every
one of us, men, horses, and dogs, being in a couple of
minutes examined, kindly
treated, and comfortably
lodged.
It took us about two hours to inspect the farm and

GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
its dependencies
; and I should willingly describe it
all, did I not prefer to show the reader Mr. Bulow’s
daughters, four buxom
lasses, for whom our arrival
was a great event.
Their age was from sixteen to
twenty
;
they
were
radiant
with
freshness
and
health, and, in all their manners and movements, so
simple, lithe, and easy, that even the most ordinary
action lent them a thousand charms.
Soon after our walk over the farm, we sat down to
a table, which was abundantly supplied.
There was
a superb joint of corned beef, a stewed goose, and a
magnificent haunch of mutton, with vegetables of all
kinds, and at each end of the table two huge jugs of
excel] ent
cider,
of which
I never
tired
drinking.
After showing our host
that,
in appetite
at
least,
we were genuine sportsmen, he turned his attention
to the
object
of our journey,
indicating
the
best
places to
find game, the land-marks by which we
should find our way back, and
especially the farms
where
we could obtain
refreshments.
The
ladies
having in the mean time made ready some excellent
tea, we drank two or three cups of it, and were then
shown
to
a
double-bedded
room, where we
slept
luxuriously after our exercise and good cheer.
Next morning we started
for the chase, though
not
very
early, and
after
reaching
the
limits
of
the clearings made by Mr. Bulow,
I found myself

for the
first time
in a virgin forest, where the axe
had never yet resounded.
It was delicious to walk
through
it, noting the good and the

hy Time, the

; and
I amused
myself in tracing
all the various phases of an oak’s
existence, from
the moment
it springs
out
of
the
earth with two leaves, to that when
all that remains
of it is a long dark line—the dust of
its heart.
After
being
scolded
by
King
for
letting
my
brains
go
a
wool-gathering,
we began
our
sport.
First we
killed
several
of those pretty
little gray
partridges which
are
so plump and tender
;
next
we brought down six or seven gray squirrels, much
thought of in that country
; and finally, our lucky
star led us
into
the midst of a
flock
of
turkeys.
They rose up each a short time after another, flying
with a quick, noisy flap of the wings, and screaming
loudly.
King
fired
at
the
first
turkey
and
then
gave
chase.
The others were out of shot, when the only
remaining
straggler
rose
at ten yards’
distance
;

took aim as he crossed a clearing, and the bird fell
dead.
To understand my extreme delight
at
this
fine
shot, you must bo a sportsman.
I
laid hold upon
the noble
bird, and was turning
it on
every
side,
when I heard King shouting
for
assistance.
I ran

66
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
to the place, and found
that
all he wanted was to
assist him
in finding
a turkey which he
declared
he
had
killed,
although nowhere
to be found.
I
set my
dog
on
the
search
; but
he
led
us
into
thickets so close and thorny that a snake could not
have gone through, and we had
to give
it up
as
a bad job—a result which by no means improved
my
companion’s
temper
during
the
rest
of
our
sport.
Nothing of importance
followed,
unless that, on
our way back, we lost ourselves in those illimitable
woods, and ran a great
risk
of having to spend the
night
there, had
it not been
for the bass voice of
Mr. Bulow, mixed with the
silvery
voices
of
his
daughters.
They had come
to meet
us, and thus
got us out of our difiiculty.
The
four
sisters were
fully equipped with fresh
dresses, new
sashes,
pretty
hats and dainty boots,
all of which showed they had taken some pains on
our account
; and
for my
part, I wished
to
be as
amiable as
possible
to the one who took my arm,
which she did with the
air of having quite a wife’s
right to do so.
On arriving
at the farm, we found supper on the
table.
Before
sitting
down,
however,
we
enjoyed
for a minute
or two the
cheerful
blaze
of
a
fire
which had been
lighted

refresh
us—a

derived,
I
believe,
from
the
Indians,
who
have
always a fire in
their cabins.
Or
it may be a tra-
dition from
St.
Francis de
Sales, who used
to say
that a fire is a good thing for twelve months of the
year
; an opinion, however, to which I do not sub-
scribe.
After eating as if we had been famished, an ample
bowl of punch was brought
to
assist in finishing off
the evening, and the conversation of our
host, who
talked much
more
unreservedly
and
at
his
ease
than on
the previous evening, led us
far
into the
night.
We spoke
of
the War
of
Independence,
in which Mr. Bulow had served as a superior officer;
of
Lafayette, whom
the
Americans
always
call
“the
Marquis,”
and
whose memory they
regard
with an ever-increasing respect
;
of agriculture, then
greatly enriching the
United
States
; and,
finally,
of my own dear
France, which
I
then
loved
all
the more from being compelled to leave
it.
From
time
to
time, Mr.
Bulow
would,
as
an
interlude, ask his eldest daughter, Maria, to give us
a song.
Without being pressed, though not without
a
charming
hesitation,
she
sang
us
the national
“ Yankee Doodle,”
the
“ Lament
of Queen Mary,”
and one on Major André—all popular in that part of
the
country.

as
they
were
getting
the
horses

Mr.
Bulow
took me
aside and made
the
following remarkable observations
:
“ In me you see a happy man, if there
is one on
earth.
All
that
surrounds
you, or
that you
have
seen
in my house, is produced
on
the farm
; these
stockings were knitted by my daughters ; my shoes
and clothes come from my
flocks, which, with my
garden and
farmyard,
also supply
plain and
sub-
stantial food.
Moreover, it
is to the honour of our
government that in Connecticut there are thousands
of farmers quite as well off as myself, and not one of
them, any more than
myself, ever
locks
his
doors.
We have scarcely any
taxes,
or anything
else
to
disturb our peace
of mind.
Congress
assists
the
growth of our industries in every possible way
; we
have agents from every quarter
to rid us of what-
ever we have
to
sell
; and
at the present moment,
for example, I have sufficient money in hand for a
long
time, having just
sold
at twenty four
dollars
the
wheat
which
I
usually
give
for
eight.
All
these advantages
are due
to the

have gained by arms and founded on good laws.

hear
the sound of the drum,
and
unless
on
the
fourth
of
July,
the
glorious
anniversary
of our independence, never
see
either
soldiers, uniforms, or bayonets.”
Throughout the whole time
of our return from
the farm
I was absorbed in deep thought, not, how-
ever,
about
Mr.
Bulow’s
concluding
speech,
but
something
very
different.
I
was
thinking how
I
should get my turkey cooked, being afraid, for one
thing, that I could not find everything at Hartford
that was necessary
to
display my spolia opima
to
advantage, and so raise a trophy of my skill.
It costs me a painful effort to suppress the details
of my exertions, as artiste, to give to my American
guests a dinner in good style.
Suffice it to say that
the
wings
of
the
partridges
were
served
up
en
papillote, and the gray squirrels stewed in Madeira.
As for the turkey, which was the only roast we had,
it was tempting
to look upon, delightful
to
smell,
and delicious
to taste
; and
so, up to the disappear-
ance
of the
very
last
morsel, you could
hear,
all
round
the
table,
“ Very
good
!
“ Excellent
! ”
“ My dear sir, what a glorious bit
! ” *

We
say
“good
for
food,” in
order
to exclude such animals
as the fox^ the badger, the raven, the wild goose, the
owl, and so forth.
We
classify game in three
divisions.
First, all
the small
birds, from the thrush downwards.
The
second includes the corn-crake, the snipe, partridge,
pheasant,
hares
and
rabbits—game
properly
so-
called, on lands
or marshes, with down or feathers.
The third is generally known as venison
;
to wit, the
wild boar, deer, roebuck, and others analogous.
Game
is a principal luxury at the
dinner-table;
it
is wholesome, heating, well-tasted and flavoured,
and easy of digestion to young stomachs.
Many of
those qualities, however, are due in a great measure
to the skill of the cook.
Throw into a pot of water
some
salt and a piece
of beef, and you have pre-
sently soup and a dish of boiled meat.
Instead of
beef put venison—you will have but poor fare
; from
this point of view, butcher’s meat has the advantage.
Under
the
directions
of
a
skilful
cook, however,
game
is
scientifically modified and transformed
in
very many
ways,
furnishing
most
of
the
highly
flavoured
dishes
which
are
the
chief
boast
of
gastronomic art.

Game also owes much of its quality to the nature
of the ground
it
is
fed
on.
The red partridge
of
Périgord
tastes
differently from
that
of
Sologne
;
and
whilst a hare
killed
in the neighbourhood of
Paris seems but a poor dish, a leveret from the sun-
burnt
slopes
of
Valromey
or
the
highlands
of
Dauphiné might be pronounced the finest flavoured
of all quadrupeds.
Amongst
small
birds,
the
first
in
order
of
excellence
is, without
contradiction, the
fig-pecker.
He fattens quite
as much
as
the
redbreast
or the
ortolan,
and
nature
has
endowed
him
with
so
exquisite
a
combination
of a

and
a
very
choice
flavour,
that
all

If the fig-peckers were as
big as pheasants, they would certainly cost as much

The

is

of

first order thirty years before the word was known.
Taking the plump little bird by the beak, sprinkle
a little salt over him, pull out the gullet, pop him
cleverly into your mouth, and biting him off close to
the fingers, chew with all your might; you will imme-
diately have juice enough to flood the palate, and you
will taste a pleasure unknown to the uninitiated

Of all kinds of game, properly so-called, the quail
is perhaps
the

taste, but by
its form and
colour.
Only
ignorance can excuse those who serve it up otherwise
than
roasted
or en painllotes, because
its
flavour
is
so easily lost, that if the animal
is plunged in any

it gave

for.
However
this may
be,
it
is certain
that the watery empire contains an immense number
of beings of every form and size, with vital qualities
in very different proportions.
Fish, being less nourishing than meat, and more
succulent than
vegetables, forms a “middle term,”
suitable
to nearly every temperament, and may be
allowed even to convalescents.

The Greeks and Romans, though not so advanced
in the art of preparing
fish, held
it nevertheless in
great repute, and pushed their refinement to such a
point as to be able, by merely tasting, to tell in what
water it had been caught.
They had ponds to keep
them in, and the classical reader will remember the
cruelty of Vedius Pollio, who fed his lampreys with
the bodies of slaves
killed for the purpose—an act
of
cruelty
which
the

Domitian
highly
blamed, and which he ought to have punished,*
A great discussion has been raised as to whether
sea fish
or fresh-water
fish should bear the palm
;
and most probably the question
will always remain
open, since, as the Spaniards say, “ sobre gustos no
hay disputas.”
Every man
is affected differently
: those fleeting
sensations cannot be expressed in any language, and
we have no standard by which to compare a cod-fish,
a sole, or a turbot, with a salmon-trout, a pike of the
primest, or even a tench of six to seven pounds.
It
is agreed on
all hands
that fish is much less
nourishing than meat, whether on account
of the
want of osmazome, or
of
its
being
less dense and

little nourishing matter, which explains why a man
can eat so many just before dinner without spoiling
his
appetite.
Formerly,
as many
of
us
can
re-
member, every dinner
of
importance
began
with
oysters, and there was always a good number of the
guests who would swallow a gross without stopping.
Wishing once
to know the weight of this advance
guard, I ascertained that a dozen oysters weigh four
ounces, and
a
gross, therefore, three pounds
; and
there is no doubt the appetites of the guests would
have been
completely appeased
if they had eaten
the same quantity of meat, even if only chicken.
In 1798 I was at Versailles, as Commissary of the
Directory, and had frequently to meet the
Oyster
registrar of
the tribunal, M. Laperte.
He
was
so
fond
of oysters
that
he
used
to
grumble
about never having had what
he
called
“ a good

Being determined
to procure him
that
satisfaction, I asked him
to

He came

I
kept up with him
to the third dozen, letting him
then go on by himself ; he went on
steadily to the

to say, for more than an hour
— as they were opened
but
slowly

as in the
meantime I had nothing else to do—a
state quite
unbearable at table—I stopped him just as he was
beginning to show more go than

but, more
generally, it

a

which

From some passages in the ancient writers we can
readily believe that the Eomans had observed that

It is in the New

For

that
it required
the heat
of the
tropics
to grow
sugar,
till, about
1740, Margraff discovered
it in some plants of the
temperate zone, such as the beet-root.
Then, at the

scientific investigation into
the matter, and with abundant success, for it became
certain that sugar was widely dispersed throughout
the vegetable kingdom.
It was found in the grape,
the chestnut, the

especially the
beet-root.
Hence
the

of

such
success as to prove abundantly that, so

In connection with
this, I may mention,
as
a

instance
of
the
force
of
prejudice
and of the difficulty of establishing a fact, that out
of a hundred British subjects taken indiscriminately,
there
are not

that sugar can be

M.
Delacroix,
an author whose

Versailles about the price of sugar—then more than
four shillings a pound.
“ Ah
! ” he would say in his
gentle way, “ if ever it should come to be sold
at a
shilling, I shall never drink water without sugar in
it.”
His prayers have been heard, and, as he
still

“ Sire,”

“ there

sugar, gum, and starch; they

my opinion, that some of the particles may, in the

Every one who drinks

Buffon drank a

A man

I am one of those who have been obliged to give
up using
coffee, and
shall
finish
this
section by
giving an incident from my personal experience.
One day the Duke of Massa, then a Minister of
State, assigned me a duty for next morning
;
and, as
I wished
to bestow pains upon
it, I made up my
mind to do without sleep, and
therefore drank after
dinner two large cups
of the
strongest
coffee.
On
returning home
at
seven
o’clock,
instead
of
the
papers necessary for preparation, I found a letter to
say
that, owing
to some
official
formality, I could
not receive them before next day.
After a game at
cards, I went to bed

out inquietude, but thinking I should at least have

was
quite
wrong, however;
and
after-
being two hours in bed, I only felt more wide-awake.
I was in a state
of lively mental agitation, pictur-
ing to myself my brain as a mill, with all the wheels
going and nothing
to
grind.
To
utilize
this
dis-
position, I set myself to make a poetical version of
a story I had recently read in an English book, but
sleep came no nearer; then I undertook a second,
and
after
composing
a dozen
lines, gave up
the
attempt.
In short, I spent the night without sleep-
ing or even feeling sleepy;
and
getting up next
morning spent the whole day without any change
of
feeling.
On
going
to

the

I
calculated that I had been
for forty hours without
shutting my eyes.

The cacao, or chocolate tree, is indigenous to South
America, being found both
in the islands On choco-
and on the continent
; and it is to its bean,
when ground and mixed with
sugar, and flavoured
with cinnamon or vanilla, etc., that the name choco-
late is given.
With some
of
the
Spanish
ladies
in
the New
Woild, the liking for chocolate has become quite a
passion, and they even have
it brought

Linnæus, as is well known, named the tree “ Theo-

qualification

his
excessive fondness for
chocolate, others
to his desire

it
habitually,
and
others,
again,
to
his
gallantry,

After eating a good and hearty breakfast, if you

THEOEY OF FEYING.
It
was
a
fine
day
in
the month
of
May.
The
smoky roofs of the Capital of Pleasure were bathed
in pleasant sunshine, and the
streets, for a wonder,
showed
neither mud
nor
dust.
The heavy stage-
coaches had
for
some
time
ceased
to shake
the
streets, and the huge waggons were
at
rest.
Only
open carriages were
to be
seen,
full
of fair
ladies,
native
or
foreign, shaded
under
pretty
hats, and
casting haughty or coquettish looks upon the men
who passed, according as they were pitiful or hand-
some fellows.
In other words, it was about three
in the
after-
noon, when the professor sat down in his reflecting-
chair, with one leg resting
vertically on the
floor,
and
the
other
stretched
diagonally
across
it,
his
back comfortably supported, and
his hands
resting
on the lions’ heads which terminate the arms of that
venerable
piece
of
furniture.
His high
forehead
showed a
love
of serious
study, and
his mouth a
taste for agreeable recreation
;
while his thoughtful
air and
attitude
at once suggested experience and
wisdom.

AVhen thus established, the professor sent for his
head cook, and immediately that
servitor appeared,
ready to receive advice, lesson, or command.
“ Well, Alaster La Planche

professor,

ON
THIRST.
We believe that the seat of the feeling of thirst
is
the digestive system generally. When one is thirsty
—as we have often been when hunting—there
is a
well-defined
feeling throughout
all
the
absorbing
parts of the mouth, throat, and stomach.
So keen is the sensation of thirst, that, in nearly
every language,
the
word
is
used
to
express
an
excessive longing
or eager desire
;
thus, we have a
thirst for power, wealth, vengeance, etc.
Thirst
kills much
more
quickly than
hunger.
We have examples
of men who have survived
for
eight days without eating, because they had water,
whilst those who are absolutely deprived of anything
to drink never pass the fifth day.
The difference is
explained by the fact, that the latter die simply of
exhaustion
and
weakness,
whilst
the
former
are
seized by a fever, which
bui’us them up, and keejis
increasing in malignancy.
Sometimes
thirst causes death
in even a shorter
time.

Another active cause of thirst is the exposure to
a rapid current of air
; a fact which I shall illustrate
by the following incident.
One day, when about to commence quail-shooting
with some
friends on a
hill near Nantua, a north
wind sprang
up, and before we had been a quarter
of an hour
afield, every one of us was thirsty, and
after a consultation
it was
decided that we should
have something
to drink every quarter of an hour.
Our
thirst,
however, was
invincible;
neither
wine,
nor brandy, nor wine mixed with
water, nor
water
mixed with brandy, was
of the
slightest
use.

; whereas, on the
following
day, the wind having
fallen
during the
night, we hunted a great
part
of the day
without
being
inconvenienced
by
the
thirst,
though
the
sun’s heat was quite as strong, or even stronger.
But
that
was
not
the
worst of
it
;
our
flasks,
though well and prudently filled on leaving home,
had
been
so
often
laid under requisition the
first
day, that now they were as useless as bodies without
souls, and we had to fall back upon what the country
inns
afforded.
There
was
no
help
for
it, yet we
groaned
; and it was with no gentle anathema that I
apostrophized the parching wind when
I saw that
regal dish, épinards à

‘ Surêne, a pleasant village on the Seine, to the west of Paris,
famous for its poor wine.
The saying is that it needs three men
to drink a glass of Surêne wine, one to swallow, and two assistants,
to keep him up and prevent him from losing heart.’
Our author has himself already spoken of
it proverbially, in the
second chapter, as being the greatest possible contrast to Cham-
bertin.
It was a joke of Henry IV. to talk of his good wine of Surêne.

is
the
only
drink
which
really

Most of the other beverages are

Whatever

several
soldiers who had preceded them by a day’s march,
and
were
killed
by

Amongst
these

of

a carabineer
well known to nearly all the detachment.
He must
have been dead more than twenty-four hours, and
from the sun beating on his

for a whole day,
it was

as a crow.
Some
of the

gathering about him, either to take a last look or
to
act
as
his
heirs
(if there was
anything), were
astonished
that
his limbs were
not

there was still some warmth over his heart.

it
is im-

Wine, the chief favourite, whether we owe
it to Noah, who planted the vine, or to Bacchus, who
squeezed out the juice of the grape, takes
its date
from the infancy of the world
; and beer, attributed
to Osiris, goes hack to the very dawn of history.
All
men,
even
those whom
we
agree
to
call
savages, have been
so tormented
with
that
desire
for strong drinks, that, however limited their know-
ledge, they have succeeded in finding some.
They
have
soured
the milk
of their domestic animals
;
they have
extracted
the

of different
fraits,
roots—whatever they may have imagined to contain

principle.
Wherever we
find men
together, we also find they are provided with strong
liquors, which they make use of at their banquets,
their
religious
ceremonies,
their
marriages,
their
funerals—in

on
every

from

Arabians, who
had

it
to

the
perfume of flowers—especially of the
rose, so
cele-

in
their writings—some began
to think
it
possible that the cause of the high quality, peculiar
flavour,
or specially stimulating
property of
wine
might be discovered,
and, by
tentatively
groping
and
feeling
their
way,
they
discovered
alcohol,
spirits-of-wine, brandy.
The knowledge of how to extract alcohol has, more-
over,
led'
to
other
important
results;
for
similar
methods have discovered some substances previously
unknown,
such
as
quinine,
morphine, strychnine,
and others of the same sort.
In any case, this thirst for a liquid which Nature
had
wrapped
up
in
mystery—an
extraordinary
desire,
influencing
all
races
of
men, under
all
climates and
in
all
latitudes—well
deserves to
fix
the attention of the philosophic observer.
I,
too, have
given thought
to the
subject, and
feel tempted to put the desire for fermented liquors
in
the
same
category with
the
anxiety
about
a

state— both
being unknown
to

attributes

SAID, “the

idea
which has awakened in my mind a train of thought
leading far away from my subject.
There are unassailable proofs that our globe has

several
absolute
changes, and
these have
been

Some
instinct warns
us
that
there
are
others
to

Already, men
have
often
believed
that such
a
revolution was on the eve of taking place; and I
know a good many people who were sent
to

disposed
to surround such a
catastrophe with judgments
of vengeance, destroy-

there
is no need of such a hubbub
for

; we are
not worth
so much pomp,
and the whole

of

ox THE LOVE OF GOOD LIVING.
I HAVE consulted the dictionaries under the word
“ gourmandise,” and am by no means
satisfied with
what I
find.
The love of good living seems to be
constantly confounded with gluttony and voracity:
whence
I
infer
that
our
lexicographers, however
otherwise estimable, are not to be classed with those
good
fellows
amongst
learned men who
can put
away
gracefully
a wing
of partridge and
then, by
raising the
little
finger, w'ash
it down with a glass
of Lafitte or Clos-Vougeot.
They have irtterly forgot that social love of good

Roman luxury, and Parisian refinement.
It implies

It
is
a precious
quality, almost deserving
to rank
as a
virtue, and
is very
certainly the
source
of much
unqualified enjoyment.
“ Gourmandise,” or the love of good living,
is an

rational,

habitual

It is opposed to excess
; therefore every man
who
eats
to
indigestion,
or makes himself drunk,
runs the
risk
of being erased from
the
list
of
its
votaries.
Gourmandise
also comprises a
love
for dainties
or tit-bits, which is merely an analogous preference,
limited to
light, delicate or small dishes, to pastry,
and so forth.
It is a modification allowed in favour
of the women, or men of feminine tastes.
Regarded from any
point
of view,
the
love
of
good
living
deserves nothing
but
praise and
en-
couragement.
Physically,
it
is
the
result
and
proof
of
the
digestive organs being
healthy and
perfect.
Morally,
it shows
implicit
resignation
to
the commands of Nature, who, in ordering man to
eat that he may live, gives him appetite to
invite,
flavour to encourage, and pleasure to reward.

who

with

and

What
else
supports the
industrious
army of cooks, pastry cooks, confectioners, and many
other
food-preparers, with
all
their
various
assist-
ants?
These
various branches
of industry
derive
their support, in a great measure, from the largest
incomes, but they
also rely upon the daily wants
of all classes.
As society is at present constituted, it
is almost
impossible
to conceive
of a
race
living
solely
on
bread
and
vegetables.
Such a nation would

fallibly be conquered by the armies of some
flesh-

(like the Hindoos, w-ho have been the

those, one

to

contributions.
Everything we
eat
is
taxed,
and
there is no exchequer that
is not substantially sup-
ported by lovers of good living.
Shall we speak of that swarm
of cooks who have
for ages been annually leaving France, to improve
foreign nations in the art of good living ?
Most of
them
succeed
;
and,
in
obedience
to
an
instinct
which
never
dies
in a Frenchman’s
heart,
bring
back
to
their country the
fruits of their economy.
The sum thus imported
is greater than might be
supposed, and
therefore they, like the others,
will
be honoured by posterity.
But
if
nations
were
grateful, then Frenchmen,
above
all
races, ought to
raise a temple and altars
to “ Gourmandise.”

These
terrors were proved

result;
and
to the
great
astonishment
of
all engaged
in
financial matters, the payments were made without
difficulty,
credit
rose,
loans
were
eagerly caught
at, and during
all the time
this “ superpurgation ”
lasted, the balance
of
exchange was
in favour of
France.
In other words, more money came into the
country than went out of
it.
What is the power that came to our assistance ?
Who is the divinity that worked this miracle ?

When the Britons, Germans, Teutons, Cimmerians,
and Scythians made

they brought a rare voracity, and stomachs of no

had to supply them with.

and soon the Queen

They drank with

the most
expensive
wines,
in the hope of
finding
some enjoyment
in them
hitherto
unknown,
and
seemed
quite
astonished
when
they
were
dis-

the husband
of Pamela, who has been disinherited
on

lives on

Sitting one day at a grand banquet, I had oppo-

the
predisposition I have
described.
Leaning
to
the
guest
beside
me,
I
said
quietly
that,
from
her physiognomy, the young lady on the other side
of the table must be fond of good
eating.
“You
must be mad
! ” he answered ;
“ she is but fifteen, at
most,
which
is
certainly
not the
age
for such a
thing.
However, let us watch.”
At
first, things were by no means in my favour,
and I was somewhat afraid of having compromised
myself, for during the
first two courses, the young
lady quite astonished me by her
discretion, and
I
suspected
we
had
stumbled
upon
an
exception,
remembering
that
there
are some
for
every
rule.
But at last the dessert came—a dessert both magni-
ficent
and
abundant—and my
hopes
were
again
revived.

I hope in vain

Thus
was my diagnosis

Whilst I was writing the above, on a fine winter’s
evening, M. Cartier, formerly the
first
violinist at
the Opera, paid me a visit, and sat down at the fire-
side.
Being full of my subject, I said, after looking
at him attentively
for some time,
“How does
it
happen, my dear professor, that you are no epicure,
when you have
all the features
of one ?”
“I was
one,” he replied, “ and among the foremost
; but now

“ On principle, I suppose ? ” said I
; but
all the answer
I had was
a
sigh, like
one
of Sir
Walter Scott’s—that is to say, almost a groan.

The causes which act upon doctors are very

I ventured one day
to express
this opinion at a
banquet in which, with eight others, I took a part,
with Dr. Corvisart at the head of the table.
It was
about the year 1806 .
“ You

cried I, with the inspired tone of a Puri-
tan preacher
; “ you are the
last remnant of a body
which formerly covered the whole of Franee.

of the three hundred Spartans

At
the
same
dinner
I
observed
the
following
noteworthy
fact.
The
doctor,
who, when
in
the
mood,
was
a
most
agreeable
companion,
drank
nothing but iced champagne, and therefore, in the
earlier part of the dinner, whilst others were engaged
in eating, he kept talking loudly and telling stories.
But
at dessert, on the contrary, and when the gene-
ral
conversation began
to
be
lively,
he
became
serious, silent, and sometimes low-spirited.
From this observation, confirmed by many others,
I
have
deduced the
following theorem: “Cham-
pagne, though at
first exhilarating, ultimately pro-
duces stupefying effects

is a well-known characteristic of the carbonic acid
which it contains.

A doctor of judgment will never lose sight of the
instinctive tendency
of our inclinations,
or
forget
that if painful sensations are naturally fraught with
danger, those which
are
pleasant have
a
healthy
tendency.
We have seen a drop
of wine, a cup of
coffee, or a thimbleful of liqueur, call up a smile to
the most Hippocratic face.*
Those
severe
prescribers
must,
moreover, know
very
well
that
their
prescriptions
remain
almost
always without
result.
The patient tries to evade
the duty
of taking them
;
those about him
easily
find a good excuse for humouring him, and thus his
death is neither hastened nor retarded.
In 1815, the medical allowance of a sick Kussian
would have made a drayman drunk, and that of an
Englishman was enough
for a
“ Limousin.”
Nor
was any diminution possible, for there were military
inspectors constantly going round our hospitals to
examine the supply and consumption.
I am the more confident in announcing my opinion
because
it
is based upon numerous
facts, and
the
most
successful
practitioners
have used a system
closely resembling
it.

of those
days.
He fell

doctor’s
first words were

On his

visit, however, our physician found
beside the
bed
of his patient the corpus delicti
itself;
to wit, a
table covered with a snow-white cloth, a crystal cup,
a handsome-looking bottle, and a napkin to wipe the
lips.
At this sight he
flew into a violent passion,
and spoke of leaving the house, when the wretched
canon cried
to him,
in tones
of lamentation, “ Ah,
doctor, remember
that, in forbidding me
to
drink,
you have not forbidden me the pleasure of looking
at the bottle
! ”
The physician who treated Montlusin of Pont de
Veyle was still more
severe, for not only did he for-
bid the use of wine to his patient, but also prescribed'
large doses of water.
Shortly after the doctor’s de-
parture, Madame
Montlusin, anxious
to give

in

offered him
a

water.

it with docility, and began to drink
it

;
but

as they have

the body has beyond comparison a better chance of

This fact of physiology
is also supported by his-

such

that
the

characteristic
of those who have more
pretention than right to the honours of good living
consists
in
this:
that, with
the best cheer
in the

faces
expressionless.
Such men do not deserve
to
have treasures lavished
upon them
of which they
feel not the value, and we have therefore sousfht for
a means of designating them, and so classifying the
guests at any table.

or gauges we mean
dishes
of acknowledged flavour, and
of such
indisputable
excellence that the mere sight of them, to a man
of
healthy
organization, moves
every
faculty

taste
;
so that men whose
faces, under such circum-

as unworthy the

In the enumeration we are about to make of the
dishes which have been
raised
to
the
dignity
of
tests, we
shall begin with those that are of lowest
force, and enumerate the others in order as they rise
gradually in the scale.
A friend has suggested the eonsideration of nega-
tive
tests;
as,
for
example, the
accident

miscarriage of some rare dish,* or the non-arrival of

is an anecdote

curring in an
article on
gastronomy
in
the
Quarterly
Review
Cardinal Fesch had invited a large party of clerical magnates
to
dinner.
By a fortunate coincidence, two fine turbots had arrived
as presents on the very morning
of the
feast,
and the cardinal
was anxious to have the credit of both.
“ Bo of good faith, your
eminence,” said the chef, on being consulted, “ both shall appear
;
both
shall enjoy the reception which
is their due.”
Dinner was
served
: one of the turbots relieved the soup, and delight was on
every
face.
It was the inomeut of the positive
test.

; might one not note the different
degrees of regret

stamped upon the
faces of the guests at such tiresome news, and so de-
vise a good criterion of their gastronomic sensibility ?
This proposal, however, though very attractive at
the first glance, could not stand a thorough exami-
nation,
We have
seen
that such an
occurrence,
though only superficially affecting the undeveloped
organs of the ordinary outsiders, might, in the case
of the
initiated and
true
believers,
be
dangerous,
if not positively even fatal.
We proceed now to give the
list of dishes which,
in our opinion, are suitable to serve
as gastronomic
tests, classifying them into three series, arranged in
an ascending scale.

good bacon.

effect, it must be
served on an ample
scale.
Ex-
perience, founded on the knowledge of the human
race, has taught us that the rarest of savoury dishes
loses its influence when not in exuberant proportion.
The
flrst impression which
it excites on a guest
is
naturally checked by the
dread
of being
stingily
served, or being obliged
even, out of politeness, to
decline.

I was present
at a dinner of
gastronomes of the fourth
of their

myself.
After a
magnificent
first
course,
there was brought to table, amongst other things, an
enormous fowl, stuffed with truffles almost
to burst-
ing, and a Gibraltar of a Strasbourg jjaté-de-foie-gras.

apparition
produced upon
the company a
marked
effect,
though
indescribable,
somewhat
resembling the

of Cooper.
In fact,
all conversation was

TEE PLEASUEES OF THE TABLE.
Of all the creatures that have senses, man
is incon-
testably that which undergoes the most
suffering.
This decree of destiny has been, in
its
fulfilment,
aggravated by a host of maladies produced by the
habits of social life
; so much so, that the most keen
and
enjoyable
pleasure we
can
imagine
cannot,
either in
intensity
or
duration, make
up
for
the
atrocious pain which accompanies certain disorders,
such
as
gout, toothache, acute rheumatism, stran-
gury, or that caused by the severity of punishment
practised
in some countries.
Owing to this practical dread of pain, man, even
without
being
aware of
it,
throws
himself by a
strong reaction in the opposite direction, and gives
himself up
to
the few
pleasures
allotted him by
Nature.
Hence, also, he increases them, lengthens
them, modifies them—in a word, worships them
;
for
in
the
idolatrous
ages, and
for
a
long
series
of
generations,
all
the
pleasures
were
secondary
divinities, presided over by the
superior gods.
It
is true that the severity of more modern
religions
has
destroyed
all
those
patrons,
and

Cupid, Cornus, and Diana no longer exist, except in
poetical
tradition
or memory
; but
tbe
thing
still
exists,
and, under the most serious of all forms of
belief, men carouse
at
a marriage, a baptism, and
even a funeral.
Meals or repasts, in the
sense which we give
to
the word, took
their rise in the
second era of the
human race, or as soon as
fruits ceased to be man’s
principal food.
The preparation and distribution of
the meat rendered a meeting of the family necessary,
the heads distributing to the children the product
of the chase, and the adult children
in
their turn
rendering the same service to their aged parents.
Such meetings, at
first limited
to near relations,
gradually came
to include neighbours and friends.
At a later period, when men became more widely
spread, the
weary
traveller found
a
seat at those
primitive
repasts, and
repaid them
with
tales
of
distant countries.
Hence the origin
of hospitality
and
its
rights, held sacred amongst
all races;
for
there is none, however savage, that does not hold it
a duty to respect the
life of him with whom bread
and salt have been shared.
Such, from the nature of things, must have been
the rudiments of the pleasures of the table,
^
^
’
Important
which
must
be
carefully
distinguished
distino-
from its necessary antecedent, the pleasure
of eating.

134
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
The pleasure of eating
is the present and direct
sensation of a want being
satisfied; the pleasure of
the table implies reflection, being due to the various
surroundings, such as the
place, the guests, what-
ever is said or seen during the repast.
,
The pleasure of eating
is common to us with the
animals
:
it merely supposes hunger, and that which
is necessary to satisfy
it.
The pleasure of the table
is
peculiar
to the human
species:
it implies that
care
is
bestowed
beforehand
upon
preparing
the
repast,
choosing
the
place,
and
assembling
the
guests.
The
pleasure
of
eating
requires,
if
not
hunger, at least appetite
; the pleasure of the table
is often independent of both.
The
distinction
between
those
two
modes
of
enjoyment
is
seen
at
our
banquet?.
At the
first
course, every one
eats
eagerly, without
speaking,
without attending
to anything
said; and, whatever
the
guest’s
social
rank may
be, he
only
thinks
of
doing
yeoman’s
service
in
the
general
work.
But, when the natural wants are
satisfied, reflection
arises, talk
is interchanged, a new order of things
takes place
; and he who has hitherto been a mere
eater, becomes
a
guest more
or
less
agreeable,
according to the means bestowed upon him by the
Master of all things.
The pleasure
of
tlie
table
does
not

transports
of
ecstasies;
but
it

what is lost

intensity, and

Some
distinguished by
a
peculiar
privilege of
ejects,
disposing us to all the other pleasures, or consoling
us for their loss.
In fact, both body and soul are specially conscious
of
well-being
after
a
good
dinner.
Physically,
whilst the brain
is
enlivened, the
face brightens,
the colour rises, the eyes sparkle, a pleasant warmth
is
diffused
in
every
part.
Morally,
the
wits are
sharpened, the imagination
warms,
and
the
con-
versation becomes cheerful and humorous.
Moreover, we
frequently
find
brought
together
round the same
table
all
the
modifications
intro-
duced amongst us by a highly developed sociability:
as
love,
friendship,
business,
tlieories,
influence,
solicitations, patronage, ambition, intrigue.
Hence
conviviality concerns everything
; hence it produces
fruits of all flavours.
One
immediate
result
of
those
antecedents
is,
that
all
the
ingenuity of man

the
object of

ing and intensifying

Poets have
complained
that

of

Others
have

small
capacity
of
the
stomach,
and
some
have
even
spared
it
the
duty
of
digesting
the
first
meal,
in order
to have the pleasm-e
of swallowing
a second.
That was the boldest attempt made to increase the
enjoyments of the palate.
But, being unable to cross
in that
direction the limits
fixed by Nature, men
directed their ingenuity upon the accessories, which
at
least
presented more scope.
They used
flowers
to adorn the vases and
glasses, to crown the guests
:
they ate under the vault of heaven, in gardens, in
groves,
in presence
of
all
the marvels
of nature.
To the pleasure of the table were joined the charms
of music
and
the
sound
of
instruments.
Thus,
whilst the court of the King of the Phæacians were
feasting, Phemius, the minstrel, celebrated the deeds
and warriors of bygone times.
Often, too, dancers, jugglers, and comic actors, of
both sexes and every costume, came to engage the
eye without lessening the enjoyment of the table
;
the most exquisite perfumes were shed around
; and
sometimes, even, the guests were
waited upon by
beauty unveiled.
I
could
easily
fill
pages
to
prove
these
state-
ments.
There
are
the Greek and
Latin
authors,
there
are
our
ancient
histories

to copy
from;
but
as

made,
I
simply
give
as
facts what
others
have
already proved.
In addition to the former modes
of gastronomic
gratification, we have adopted recent
dis-
coveries.
There
is no doubt the delicacy
I9th cen-
txixi©s
of our manners could not suffer the Eoman
practice
of
using
vomitories,
but
we
have
done
better, and reach the same end by a method allowed
by good
taste.
We have invented dishes so attrac-
tive that they unceasingly renew the appetite
; yet
they are
at the same time so light that they flatter
the
palate
without loading the
stomach.
Seneca
would have called them nuhes esculentas.
In gastronomic progress, indeed, we have arrived
at such a
point,
that
if the
calls
of business did
not force us to rise from the table, or the want
of
sleep interpose, the
duration
of our repasts would
be almost unlimited
; and there would be no fixed
data
for finding what
time might
elapse between
the
first
glass
of Madeira and
the
last tumbler
of punch.*
It must not be thought, however, that
all these
accessories are necessary to constitute the pleasure
of the table.
That pleasure is realized almost com-
pletely as often as we combine the four conditions

of taking Parmesan with soup and Madeira after it.

of— cheer

least
passable, good
wine,
pleasant
companions, and plenty of time.
Thus,
I have
often
wished
to have
shared
the
frugal
meal
to which
Horace
speaks
of
inviting
a neighbour, or a casual guest whom bad weather
has driven to his house to seek shelter; to wit, a fine
fowl and a young kid (in good condition, of course),
with
a
dessert
of
raisins,
figs,
and
nuts.
What
with these, and some wine
of the Manlius vintage
(“nata mecum Consule Manlio”), and the conversa-
tion of the Epicurean poet, I should have been sure
of a most enjoyable supper.
But then.
If a long-absent friend came to see me again,

In the same way, half-a-dozen friends may regale
on a leg of mutton and a kidney, washed down with
some
Orléans and excellent Médoc, and spend the
evening in talk, full of the most delightful freedom,
and in complete forgetfulness of finer dishes or more
skilful cookery.

the faces gloomy, and the dinner eaten hurriedly,
then there can be no
pleasure
at
the
table, how-
ever choice may be
the good
cheer, and however
sumptuous the accessories.
But, the impatient reader will probably exclaim,
how, then, in this present year of grace, is a dinner
to
be
regulated
so
as
to bring
together
all
the
requisites necessary to the highest pleasures of the
table ?
I proceed to answer this question.
Prepare
your minds, my readers, and give attention;
it
is
from Gasterea,* fairest of the Muses, that I receive
inspiration.
I shall be more easily understood than
an oracle, and my precepts wdll live through future
ages.
“ Let
the
number
of
the
guests
not
exceed
twelve, so that the conversation may be constantly
general.
“ Let them be chosen so that
their occupations
are various,
their
tastes analogous, and
with
such
points of contact that there will be no need for the
odious formality of introductions.
“ Let the dining-room be
brilliantly lighted, the
cloth spotless, and the atmosphere at a temperature
of from sixty to sixty-eight degrees of Fahrenheit.
* The poetical notion of a tenth Muse is more fully developed
in the last chapter of the book.
The irnportanco of Gastronomy,
artistically or æsthetically, no doubt gave it in our author’s eyes
a better claim for such a patroness than, say, History.

“ Let the men have wit without pretention, and
the women he pleasant without being coquettes.
“ Let the dishes be exceedingly choice, but small
in number
: and the wines of the
first quality, each
in its degree.
“ Let the order of serving be from the more sub-
stantial dishes to those that are lighter
; and from
the simpler wines to those of finer flavour.
Let the eating proceed without hurry or bustle,
since the dinner is the last business of the day
; and
let
the
guests
look upon themselves
as
travellers
about to reach the same destination together.
“ Let the coffee be hot and the liqueurs chosen
with particular care.
“ Let the drawing-room to which the guests retire
be large enough
to admit of a game
of cards
for
those who cannot do without
it, while leaving ample
scope for after-dinner chat.
“ Let the guests be detained by the social enjoy-
ment, and animated with the hope that, before the
evening is over, there is still some pleasure
in store.
“ Let the tea be not too strong, the toast
artisti-
cally buttered, and the punch skilfully made.
“ Let
nobody
leave
before
eleven
o’clock,
and
everybody be in bed by twelve.”

at his own apotheosis
; and his enjoyment will have
been in proportion to the number of conditions that
have been dnly fulfilled.
I have already said that the pleasure of the table,
such as I have described
it,
is susceptible of being
prolonged.
That I now proceed to prove by giving
a
true and
exact account
of the longest repast I
ever made in my life, which I present to the reader
as a little treat for his courteous attention.
On the outskirts of the Eue du Bac there was a

most kindly received by the family, who

tne
doctor,
aged
seventy-eight
;
the
captain,
seventy-six
; and
their sister, seventy-four.
“By Jove!” cried the doctor one day, rising on
tip-toe to slap me on the shoulder
; “ you have for a
long time been bragging about jom fondues^ {eggs
beaten
up with
cheese), and making
our mouths
water, it is time to put a stop to that sort of thing.
We will come and lunch with you some day, the
captain and
I, and see what the dish
is like.”
(It
is now about twenty-four years since he thus teased
me.)
“ With all my heart
1 ” said I
; “ and you will
have one in all its glory, for I shall make it myself.
I am delighted with your proposal.
So to-morrow

142
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
Punctual to
tlie minute, I saw my guests arrive,
clean shaven, their hair fresh from the barber
; two
little old men,
still hale and hearty.
They smiled
with delight on seeing the table laid for three, and
at each plate two dozen oysters with a bright golden
lemon.
At each end of the table stood a bottle of
Sauterne, carefully wiped, all except the cork, which
showed unmistakeably
that
it was
long since the
wine had been bottled.
Alas!
I have
lived
to
see
nearly the
last
of
those
cheerful
luncheons, once
so common, where
oysters
were
swallowed
by
thousands.
They
dis-
appeared with the abbés, who always ate at least a
gross, and
the
chevaliers, who
never
stopped.
I
regret
them,
but
it
is
as a philosopher;
if time
modifies governments, how great must have been its
influence upon the simple social usages
!
After the oysters, which were found
quite fresh,
the servant brought to table some roasted kidneys,
a jar of truffled foie-gras, and, last of all, the fondue.
The constituents were
all together in a saucepan,
which was placed on the table over a chafing-dish,
heated with
spirits
of
wine.
I commenced
opera-
tions, and not a single one of my evolutions on the
field
of
battle
was
lost
sight
of by my
guests.
They were loud in their praises of my success, and
asked to have the recine, which I promised, at

After the fondue came the

(a mode

;
finishing off with two liqueurs, one a spirit, to clear,
and the other an oil, to soothe.
The luncheon well over, I proposed to my guests,
by way of a slight exercise, to show them over my
house, which, without being sumptuous, is roomy and
comfortable.
One thing particularly j^leased them
—that the ceilings and gildings date from the reign
of Louis XV.
I showed them the original cast of
the bust of my pretty cousin, Madame Eecamier,f by
Chinard, and her portrait in miniature by Augustin.
With these they were so charmed that the doctor
with his big lips kissed the portrait, and the captain
was proceeding
to take the same
liberty with the
bust,
for
which
I
boxed
his
ears

original were to do the same, that
lovely bosom would soon share the fate of the big-
toe of St. Peter’s statue at Rome, which the pilgrims
have

I
afterwards
showed
them
some
casts
of
the
best
ancient
sculptures, some paintings, by no means despicable
;
my
guns, my musical
instruments, and some
fine
editions of French and foreign books.
In
this voyage
of discovery they did not forget
the
kitchen, where I showed my economical stock-
pot, my roasting-oven, my clockwork
turnspit, and
my steam
vapourizer.
They examined everything
most minutely, being the more astonished, because
in
their own house
the arrangements were
all
as
they had been during the Regency.
The
very
instant we
returned
to
the
drawing-
room
it struck two o’clock.
“ Confound it
! ”
cried
the
doctor;
“there’s
our
dinner-time,
and
sister
Jeannette must be waiting for us.
It is not that I
feel hungry, but I don’t like to miss my soup.
It is
so old a habit, that if I let a day pass without it, I
say, like Titus,
‘ diem perdidi.' ”
“ My dear doctor,”
said
I, “ why go
so far to find
what you have close at hand?
1 shall send some
one
to
tell your
sister that you are staying a little
longer at my house, to do me the pleasure of dining
here.
You must, however, make allowances, as the
dinner will not compare with a got-up impromptu.”

THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE.
1 45
This
produced
between
the
two
brothers
an
ocular consultation, followed by formal
consent.
I
despatched
the
message
to
the
Faubourg
St.
Germain, at the same time giving the hint
to my
major-domo
of the
kitchen
; and after
a
very rea-
sonable
interval, what with
his own
resources, and
what with
those
of
the
neighbouring
restaurants,
he served
us up
a
little
dinner well
dressed and
thoroughly to our taste.
It gave me special
satisfaction
to
see the calm
self-possession with which my two friends took their
places
at
the
table,
unfolded
their
napkins, and
made ready to
begin.
They had two
surprises
of
which I myself had not thought—Parmesan served
with the
soup, and
a
glass
of dry Madeira
after.
These were two novelties lately imported by Prince
Talleyrand, the
first
of our
diplomatists,
to whom
we owe
so many wise and witty
sayings, and who,
as a public man, has always attracted special atten-
tion, whether in power or retirement.
The
dinner
was
a
decided
success,
as
well
in
substantials as in
accessories, and my friends were
excellent company.
Dinner
over, I proposed a game of cards, which
guests declined—preferring, as the captain said,
far niente of the
Italians—and we accordingly
seated
ourselves
around
the
fireplace.
Thinking,

however, that, in spite of the pleasures of the dolee
far niente, there
is nothing that more enhances the
enjoyment of conversation than something to occupy
without engrossing the
attention, I proposed a cup
of tea.
My guests accepted
the
offer, though
tea
was then quite a novelty for Frenchmen of the old
stock.
I made
it before them, and they drank two
or three
cups, with all the more pleasure that they
had
always
understood
it
was merely
a kind
of
medicine.
A long experience has taught me that kindness
begets kindness, and that as soon as one concession,
is made to friendship, others are inevitable.
There-
fore, in a tone almost
imperative, I said we should
finish
off with a bowl of punch.
“ Why, you’ll be
the death
of me
! ”
cried
the
doctor.
“ Are
you
going
to make us drunk ? ” said the
captain.
My
only answer was shouting, as loudly
as I could, for
lemons, sugar, and rum.
While
mixing the
punch,
I ordered some thin
toast and salt butter to be got ready, in spite of the
declaration
of my
guests.
They
said
they could
not touch
it;
but knowing the
attractions of that
simjjle
dish,
I
said the only
tiling I was afraid
of
was that
there might
not
be
enough.
And
true
enough, seeing the captain glance
in a short time at
the empty dish, I had another supply brought.

Meanwhile, time had passed away, and the clock
showed
it was late.
“We
really must be
off; our
poor
sister has not seen us
all day, and we should
be in time to have a bit of salad with her at supper-
time.”
I made no
objection, and
faithful
to my
duty as host of two pleasant old friends, I accom-
panied them to their carriage and saw them leave.
Should you ask
if, during
so long a
sitting, we
at
any
time
felt
at
all
bored,
I
answer
with
a
decided “ No.”
The attention of my guests was kept
awake by
the
preparation
of
the fondue, by
our
voyage
over my
house, by some novelties
in
the
dinner, by the
tea, and, above
all, by the punch,
which they had never before
tasted.
Besides, the
doctor knew the whole of Paris by genealogies and
anecdotes
; the captain had spent part of his life in
Italy,
either
in
the army
or
as an envoy
at
the
Court
of* Parma
; and
I
myself have travelled
a
great
deal.
We
talked
in an
easy,
natural
flow,
and
took
pleasure
in
hearing each
other.
What
more
is needed
to make time pass agreeably and
quickly ?
Next morning
I had a note from the doctor to
say that the little debauch
of the previous evening
had done them no harm, but that, on the contrary,
after
a night
of jflcasant
sleep they got up
fresh,
quite disposed and ready to begin anew.

HALTS OF A HUNTING PAETY.
Of all a man’s experiences in which eating reckons
as
important,
one
of
the
most
agreeable
un-
doubtedly
is the
resting-time
of a hunting
party.
Of all known interludes, it alone does
not become
tiresome, however much prolonged.
After several hours of exercise, the most vigorous
hunter
feels
a want of
rest.
His
face
has
been
caressed by the morning breeze, he has exerted his
skill
as opportunity
offered, the
sun
is
near
the
highest point of
its
course
;
therefore
the hunter
proceeds to make a halt of several hours, not from
excess of fatigue, but from that impulse of instinct
by which we are warned that all energy is limited.
Some shade
attracts him, the turf receives him,
and the murmur of a neighbouring fountain invites
him
to dip
in
it the
flask intended
to quench
his
thirst.
Thus
placed, he brings
forth
with a calm
satisfaction the
small,
golden-crusted
rolls, unfolds
the
cold chicken stowed
in
his bag by
a
loving
hand,
arranging
all beside the nugget of fine old
cheese w'hich is destined to figure as his dessert.
During
these
preparations,

alone; he
is accompanied by the
faithful
animal
which heaven
has created
for his
use.
Crouched
before
him,
the
dog
looks
affectionately
at
his
master
;
having been
fellow-workers,
they
under-
stand
each
other.
They
are two
friends, and
the
servant
is
both
happy
and
proud
of
being
his
master’s
guest.
Their
appetite
is
of
a
quality
unknown both to the worldly and the devout ; to the
former
because
they never
give
hunger
time
to
come, and
to
the
latter because
they
never
give
themselves up to the exercises that produce it.
The
repast has been taken with
delight.
Each
has had
his share, and all is completed comfortably
and
peacefully.
Why should one not take a few
minutes sleep ?
Noon is the hour of rest.
Those simple
pleasures are
increased
tenfold
if
shared by
several
friends.
For then a nlore abun-
dant repast is forthcoming, and they
talk gaily of
the feats of one, the blunders of another, and their
hopes for the rest of the day.
What would it be, then, if attentive servants came,
loaded with those vases
consecrated
to Bacchus
in
which an artificial cold freezes together Madeira, the
juice
of
the
strawberry and
pineapple—delicious
drinks,
divine
mixtures which
send
through
the
veins a charming
coolness, causing
in every part a
well-being unknown to the profane.

150
GASTRONOMY A3 A FINE ART.
Bat even then we have not reached the limit in
this ascending series of delights.
There
are days when our
wives, our
sisters, our
cousins, and other lady friends, have been invited to
share
in the
pleasures
of the
chase.
At the
ap-
pointed hour there come the
handsome
carriages
loaded with the
fair, all feathers and flowers, many
of them
dressed in a style somewhat military and
coquettish.
Soon the interior of each carriage
dis-
closes
its treasures
of
pies, its marvels
of paté-de-
foie-gras, its dainties of all
possible
kinds.
Nor
is
the foaming champagne forgot, its quality enhanced
under the hand of beauty.
Seating themselves on
the green sward, they eat while the
corks
fly, and
there
is
talk, laughter, and merriment, and perfect
freedom, for the universe is their drawing-room and
the sun
their
lamp.
Besides, they
have
appetite.
Nature’s special
gift, which lends
to such a meal a
vivacity unknown
indoors, however
beautiful
the
surroundings.
As, however, everything must have an end, at the
signal
given by the master
of
the ceremonies
all
rise, and the men resume their guns, the ladies their
hats.
Good-bye
is
said, the carriages
are brought
up, and the
fair visitors
fly away, not to be again
seen till the evening.
I have hunted in the centre of France and the

most remote
provinces, and seen at
the
halt
of a
hunting party charming women, girls beaming with
freshness—some arriving
in
cabriolets, and
others
in simple country gigs, or even on the humble
ass
to which some
of the suburbs owe both fame and
fortune.
I have seen them foremost in enjoying the
slight mischances of
transport.
I have seen them
display on
the
turf the turkey in
clear
jelly, the
household
pie, the
salad
all
ready for mixing.
I
have
seen
them
dancing
with
light
foot
round
the bivouac
fire.
Having seen these and
shared
in
the games and merriment belonging
to such a
gipsy feast, I feel convinced
that, though there be
less luxury than in the former case, there
is quite
as much that is charming, gay, and delightful.
And, at the parting, Avhy should some kisses not
be bestowed upon the best huntsman, because full of
honour, upon the worst, because of his
ill-luck, and
then upon the
rest, to prevent jealousy ?
All
are
about to separate, custom authorizes
it, and to take
advantage
of such an occasion is not only allowed,
but an actual duty.
Fellow-sportsmen, ye who are prudent and nevef
aim heedlessly, fire straight and bag as much game
as you can before the ladies arrive
;
for experience
teaches
that, after
their
departure, the hunting
is
very rarely successful.

XVI.
ON DIGESTION.
“ It
is not what a man
eats that
nourishes him,”
says an old proverb, “ but what he digests.”
Diges-
tion, then, is a condition of existence, a law governing
as imperatively the poor as the rich, the shepherd
as the king.
But how few know what
digestion means
!
In
this most men are like M. Jourdain, who had been
speaking prose without being aware of
it
; and it is
on
their account that I give a short sketch
of this
subject,
feeling
certain
that
M.
Jourdain
was
greatly
pleased when
assured by the
philosopher
that what he spoke was prose.
Digestion
is
a purely mechanical
operation, and
the digestive apparatus may be considered as a mill
furnished with
its
sieves, in order to
extract from
the food
all
that can
be
of
use
in repairing the
bodily wants, and reject the husky residuum.
After
being impregnated by the
various
fluids
supplied
by the mouth and esophagus, the food, on reaching
the stomach, is
for several hours submitted to the
action of the gastric juice, at a temperature of more
than 100° of Fahrenheit.

ON DIGESTION.
153
The chyle elaborated by this operation is a white
liquor, almost without
taste
or
smell, but
of such
importance
that, as soon as
it
is received
into the
circulation, the
individual becomes aware of
it by
the conscious increase of vital force, and an intimate
conviction that the bodily losses are made good.
Digestion is of longer or shorter duration, accord-
ing to the particular
disposition
of the
individual.
The average time may be
given
at
about
seven
hours—rather
less
than half of which
is assigned
to the stomach, or digestion proper.
Of
all the
bodily
functions,
digestion
is
that
which
has
most
influence on the morale
of the individual—his feelings and mental
of diges-
conditions.
Let this assertion astonish no
one, for it is necessarily true.
The most elementary
principles
of
psychology teach
us that the mind
receives impressions only through the organs which
are
subject
to
it, and
place
it in communication
with
exterior objects
;
hence
it
follows
that, when
these organs are out of order, enfeebled, or irritated,
that state of degradation must affect the sensations,
which are the intermediary and occasional means of
the
intellectual operations.
Thus, by our habitual
mode
of
digestion,
especially
in
its
later
stages,
we
are
rendered
habitually sad
or
gay,
silent
or
talkative, morose or melancholy, without even sus-

OASTEONOMY AS A FINE AET.
pecting
it,
and,
wliat
is more, without being able
to prevent
it.
In young people digestion
is often accompanied
by a slight
shiver;
in the old by a strong
desire
to
sleep.
In
the
former
case,
it
is Nature with-
drawing the
caloric from the
surfaces to use it in
her laboratory, and in the latter, the natural power,
already enfeebled by age, cannot
suffice at the same
time for the work of digestion and the excitation of
the senses.
Some
persons
always
show temper
during
the
time
of digestion, and nobody should then propose
plans to them, or beg
favours.
Marshal Augereau
was a
special
instance
of this, for during the
first
hour
after dinner he would
kill whoever came
in
his
way, friend
or enemy.
One day
I heard him
say that there were in the army two persons whom
the chief commander could
at any time order to be
shot, namely, the paymaster and the captain of the
staff.
They
were both
present.
General
Cherin
made some reply in a cajoling tone, but with spirit
;
the paymaster
said
nothing, though
he
probably
thought none the less.
I was then on the marshal’s
staff, and a Icnife and
fork were always
laid
for me
at
his
table, but
I
seldom went, from dread of those periodical squalls,
being afraid, in fact, lest on a single word he should

I
have
often since met him in
Paris, and as he used
to express regret
at not having met me more
fre-
quently,
I
made
no
concealment
of
the
cause
:
though laughing over
it, he almost admitted that I
Avas not entirely wrong.
It was at Offenhurg we were then on service, and
a special grievance
of the staff was that we had no
game or fish at dinner.
The complaint was not un-
reasonable,
for
it
is
a
universal maxim
that the
conquerors should make good cheer at the expense
of the conquered.
Accordingly, I wrote the same
day
a
polite
note
to
the
head-forester,
pointing
out the
complaint and
prescribing
the
cure.
He
was an old German knight,
tall, meagre, and dark,
who could not
suffer
us, and no doubt
treated us
as badly
as he dared,
to prevent
oiu’ taking
root
in
his
territory.
His
reply, therefore, was
full of
evasions, and amounted
almost
to a
refusal:
the
gamekeepers
had
disappeared,
from
fear
of
our
soldiers, the fishermen Avere no longer under orders,
and the
rivers were
swollen, etc., etc.
To such ex-
cellent reasons I made no reply
; but I sent bim ten
grenadiers
to be
billeted
upon him
until
further
orders.
The medicine took
effect.
Next
morning, very
early, there arrived a cart abundantly loaded

no doubt, the gamekeepers
had returned and the
fishermen again become amenable to authority, for
there was game and
fish enough
to regale us
for
more than a week
: venison, woodcocks, carp, pike
an abundant godsend.
On receiving
this expiatory offering, I delivered
the unlucky
head-forester
of his guests.
He came
to see us, and I soon brought him to take a proper
view of the subject
;
so that, during the
rest of our
stay
in that
country, we
could
only
congratulate
ourselves on his treatment of us.

Duhaget, formerly
prior
of the
Chartreuse Pierre-

to an honourable Gascon
family, and who had served for twenty years with
distinction as captain in the infantry.
“Amongst the

said

referring to the

known
to
be

Sometimes, when
the
fit was upon him, he
left his
cell and returned
to
it by
himself;
at other times
he
lost
his way
and they were obliged to lead him back.
Several
remedies had
been
tried, and
at
last,
his
relapses
becoming less frequent, no further notice was taken
of his case.
“ One night, being later up than usual, I was at
my writing-desk, busy
with some
papers, when
I
heard the door of my room open, and soon saw this
monk
enter,
in a state
of absolute somnambulism.
His
eyes
were open and
staring, he had no clothes
on
him
except
the
tunic used
for a
night-dress,
and he held a
big knife
in
his
hand.
He went
straight
to
my
bed,
evidently
knowing
where
it
was
placed, and seemed
to
satisfy
himself,
by
feeling with his hands, that I was really in it
;
after
which, he struck three
blows with such
good-will
that, after piercing the bed-clothes, the blade went

mattrass,
or
rather,
the matting
which served for that purpose.
“ On first passing me, his features were contracted
and
his eyebrows knitted together
;
but when
he
turned round, after striking the blows, I observed that
his features were relaxed and wore an expression
of
content.
The light of the two lamps on my bureau
made no impression on his
eyes, and he went back
as he came, carefully opening and shutting the two
doors which
led
to my room, and
then
at
once
retiring quietly to his own.
“You
can
easily
form a conception,”
said
the
prior, “ of my feelings during that frightful
ajDpari-
tion.
I shuddered with horror to see the
danger
from which I had just escaped, and gave thanks to
Providence
; but my emotion was such that
it was
impossible to close my eyes for the rest of the night.
“ Next morning I sent for the somnambulist, and,
coming at once to the point, asked him what he had
been dreaming about during the night.
He was
evidently confused by that question.
‘ I have had
so strange a dream, father,’ he replied,
‘ that, indeed,
I can
scarcely
disclose
it to you
;
it may be the
work of the devil, and

“‘I command

said I;

“ ‘ I had

said
he,
‘than
I dreamt
that you had
killed my mother;
that

ghost
appeared to me,
demanding
ven-
geance, and
that
the
sight
transported me
with
such
wild
fury,
that
I
ran
like
a madman
to
your room, and,
finding you
in
bed, stabbed you
there.
Soon after
I awoke, bathed in
perspiration,
full of detestation for the attempted crime, and im-
mediately blessed God that
it had not been com-
mitted.’
“
‘ There has been more committed than you think
for,’
said I calmly, with an air of great seriousness.
Then I told him what had taken place, pointing out
the marks of the blows which he had aimed at my
person.
“ At the very sight he threw himself at my feet, all
in tears, bewailing the involuntary misfortune which
had so nearly taken place, and imploring me
to im-
pose
some
penitential duty
upon him.
‘No,’
I
said
;

ON SLEEP.
Though there are a few men
so organized that
it
might
almost he
said that
they do not sleep, yet
as
a
general
rule,
the
want
of
sleep
is
as im-
perious
as hunger
or
thirst.
The
outposts
of an
army
often
fall
asleep, even
though
they
throw
snuff into
their
eyes.
Pichegru, when tracked by
Bonaparte’s
police, gave 30,000
francs for a night’s
sleep, during which he was betrayed and given up.
Like other
pleasures, sleep may be indulged
in
to
excess,
as
in
the
case
of
those whom we
see
sleep away three-fourths of their life.
Its effects in
such instances are always bad
; such as sloth, iudo-
lence, weakness, stupidity, and death.
The
school of Salerno
allowed
only seven hours
sleep, without distinction of age or sex, a rule which
is too severe
;
for more must be granted to infants,
from
their
actual
necessity, and
to women
from
kindness.
One
thing, however, is
certain
:
that he
who
spends more than
ten hours
in
bed,
errs
in
excess.
During
the
first moments of dawning
sleep the
will still acts; one can arouse himself; a few ideas
M

1Ô2
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
still
arise
in the mind, though mostly incoherent.
Soon
all
sensation or thought vanishes, and we
fall
into absolute sleep.
How is the mind occupied during that time ?
It
lives
within
itself:
it
is
like
the
pilot
during
a
calm,
like
a
mirror
during
the
darkness, like
a
harp
whose
strings
are
untouched
;
it
awaits
the
renewal of active life.
Some
psychologists,*
however, including
Count
de Redern, maintain that the mind is constantly in
a state of activity
; the latter advancing, as a proof,
the
fact that those who
are
forcibly aroused from
their
first
sleep experience the
sensation of a man
who
is
disturbed
in some
occupation in which he
has been earnestly engaged.
In any case, the
state of absolute annihilation
is
but
short, never
exceeding
five
or
six
hours.
A
vague
consciousness
of existence
begins
to
revive,
and the sleeper passes into the realm of dreams.
Sir 'William Hamilton has advanced a similar theory in some
of his
philosophical
writings.
To prove
that
consciousness
is
continuous, he experimented upon himself by getting his servant
to awake him during sleep
at
different
times,
and
invariably
found that the mind was occupied—that there had been no break
ill the consciousness, no solution of its continuity, even though no
recollection of di-eams remained.

ON DREAMS.
Dreams are imperfect impressions which reach the
mind
without
the
assistance
of
external
objects.
As soon
as the phenomena
of
dreams
are
better
understood, the
duality of the human
constitution
will be better known.
When a man who
is awake receives impressions
from an
external
object,
the
sensation
is
precise,
direct and
inevitable, the whole
of the communi-
cating nerve being called into play.
When, on the
other hand, the same impression reaches the mind
during sleep, it is only the nearer or hinder part of
the nerve which
vibrates, and
the
sensation must
necessarily be
less
lively and
less
precise.
In one
case the percussion
traverses the whole organ, and
in the other the vibration
is confined to the parts
in the neighbourhood of the brain.
A singular thing is that it is excessively rare that
the
sensations we
dream
of have
to do ^
with
taste
or
smell
;
in
dreaming
of
a
garden or a field we see the
flowers with-
bo investi-
out smelling
their odours,
or if seated
at
a banquet, we see the
dishes without learning any-
thing of their taste or flavour.

to

Avhy

are the more intense.

they will be found to be only recollections,
or combinations of recollections.
I had almost said
that dreams are but the memory of the senses.
Their peculiarity
is that the association of those
ideas
is
different from
the ordinary mode, because
freed from the
laws
of natural sequence, from
all
conventional notions, and from time
itself.
Thus a
final analysis shows that no one has dreamed of any-
thing which was
previously
entirely unknown
to
him.
One will not be astonished at the singularity of
our dreams if he considers that, for the waking man,
there are four
faculties which
direct and mutually
correct each other—namely,

and memory
;
wliereas, in the case
of the
sleeping
man, each sense is abandoned to its own resources.
I have thought of comparing those two conditions
of the brain
to a
piano,
before which
is
seated a
musician who passes his fingers over the notes in an
absent-minded manner, and by mere memory shapes
out a melody
;
whereas, if he used all his faculties,
he could combine with it a complete harmony.
This
comparison might be carried out much farther, when
we
consider
that
reflection
is
to our
ideas
what
harmony is to soimds, and that certain ideas contain
others, just as a principal note in a chord contains
others which are subordinate to
it, and so on.
About 1790, there lived in the village Gevrin, in
my
native
parish, a merchant
of an
ex-
tremely shrewd
character,
called Landot,
tive
who had scraped together a considerable
fortune.
All
at once he was
struck
with such
a
paralytic shock
that he was believed
to be
dead.
The
faculty came to his assistance and saved him
;
but not without
loss, for he left behind him nearly
all his intellectual faculties, and especially memory.
There being, however, still
life in him, of whatever
sort, and
having
recovered
his
appetite, he
con-
tinued to take charge of his property.
Seeing him in this state, those who formerly had
business dealings with him
believed
that now was

the time
for
their
revenge,
and, on
a
pretext
of
keeping him company, they came from
all
parts
and made
proposals
of
bargains,
purchases,
sales,
exchanges, and other such transactions
as had
pre-
viously been his main occupation.
The
assailants,
however, speedily found, to
their astonishment, that
they had reckoned without their host.
The old rascal had lost not a whit of his business
capacity, and the same man who sometimes did not
know his own
servants and
forgot even his name,
was always fully informed as to the prices of goods,
as well
as of the value
of every
acre
of meadow,
vineyard, or wood, within a radius
of nine
or ten
miles round.
In those respects his powers of judging
were
intact;
and, having no
suspicion
of
such a
thinof,
the
most
of
those who
tried
the

merchant were caught in the snares they had them-
selves been laying for him.

native
town, there

thing — his
knowledge
of
card-playing.
He was
also
struck
by
paralysis
and
recovered,
retaining only two faculties
: the power of digestion,
and his skill at cards.
One day our
little town was visited by a Parisian
banker, named
M.
Delius,
if
I remember
aright.

ON BBEAMS.
167
and being a stranger with
several
letters
of intro-
duction,
all
did
their
best to
entertain him.
He
was fond of good-living and
of card-playing; the
former
proclivity
was
easily enough indulged by
keeping him
at table
for
five
or
six hours a day,
but in the case of the
latter there was more diffi-
culty.
He was very fond
of
piquet, and spoke of
playing
for six francs a point, which was enormous,
compared
to
our usual
rate
of
play.
At
last M.
Chiral
was
voted by
general
consent
to
be
his
opponent
as
representative
and
defender
of
the
town’s reputation.
When
the Parisian banker saw this
tall
figure,
pale and
ghastly, walk
in sideways and
take
his
seat as his opponent, he thought at first that it was
a
practical
joke;
but on the
spectre
taking
the
cards and shuffling like a proficient of the first class,
he began to think his opponent might at one time
have been something worthy of him.
Nor did
it
take
long
to convince him
that
the
faculty
still
remained
;
for not only in that rubber, but also
in
many
others
that
followed,
M.
Delius
was
com-
pletely
beaten,
punished,
and
plucked
;
and
on
leaving he had to count out more than six hundred
francs.

setting

for
Paris, M. Delius came
to

at the same time against the broken-down adversary
we had opposed
to him, and
declaring he

never forgive himself

It seems clear, from those instances, that, in over-

respected
that
portion
which
had
so

being that continual
exercise had given
it greater
strength to resist, or that the impressions so made
had by long repetition left deeper traces.

later, of amusement, love,
battles, and marriages
; later still, of houses, voyages,
court-favour ; last of all, of business, trouble, wealth,
bygone amusements, and
friends who
have
been
dead for years.
As the phenomena of dreams are of importance in
the interests of anthropology, I give instances from
my own experience.
One night I dreamt that I had found the
secret
of dispensing with the law of gravitation, so that, my
body having no tendency either to rise or descend,
I could do the one as easily as the other, just as I
pleased.

ON DUNAMS.
169
This
state seemed
to
be something
delightful;
and probably many have had similar dreams.
The
most remarkable
thing, however, is that I seemed
to imderstand very clearly the means by which the
result was reached, and that they seemed so simple
that I
felt amazed that they had
not been found
out sooner.
On awaking, the explanatory part
of the dream
completely
escaped
me,
but
the
conclusion
re-
mained
; and ever since I have a feeling of absolute
certainty
that,
sooner
or
later, some
enlightened
genius
will make
the
discovery.
In
any
case,
having found, I make a note of it.
Not many
months
ago,
I
experienced
such
a
sensation of pleasure during sleep as I had
Another
never
felt
or heard
of.
It consisted in a
“stance,
sort of delicious quivering through all the atoms of
my
being;
a
sort
of most
delightful
twitching,
which, beginning at the surface of my skin all over
from head to foot, vibrated through me to the very
marrow.
A bluish flame seemed at the same time
to play about my forehead
: *
Lamhere flamma comas et circum tempora pasci.

of our
author’s comparing himself

it
is unaflected.
A more famous instanco
of vanity in dreaming is that of Sir Godfrey Kneller, as described
by Pope.
The great
state-painter dreamt ho died, and
that, on

!•
From this state, of which I felt sensibly conscious,
and which I reckon to have lasted for at least thirty
seconds,
I awoke
filled with an amazement which
was
not unmixed
with
awe.
Comparing
with
it
some
observations
made
upon
peoj)le
subject
to
trances, and others morbidly
excitable,
I conclude
that the limits
of pleasure
are
yet
neither known
<
nor fixed, and that no man can say how much enjoy-
ment
our body
is
capable
of.
May we not hope
that in a few ages the physiology of the future will
have power over
those
extraordinary sensations to
produce them at will, as sleep is procured by opium
;
and
that our great-grandchildren will in that way
be recompensed
for
the atrocious suffering under-
^
gone by many in our time.
j
An argument from analogy might be brought to
support the theory I have just advanced.
Thus, as
I have
already remarked, the powers
of harmony
which procure for us an enjoyment so keen, so pure,
and
so eagerly sought after, were entirely unlcuown
to
the Komans, the
discovery being only made
in
the fourteenth century.
The following illustration, which will be at once
encmintering
St. Peter, the apostle very civilly asked his name.
“ I said it was Kneller.
I had no sooner said so than
St. Luke,
who was standing close by, turned towards me and said, with a
great deal of sweetness,
‘ AVhat, the famous Sir Godfrey Kneller
from England ?
’
‘ The very same,
sir,’ said
I,
‘ at your
service.’ ”

tinderstood by men of letters,
is a clear proof that
man’s moral nature
is under the
influence of the
physical.
When comfortable in bed in a horizontal position,
a man, thinking
of the work
that during
the day
engages
his
attention,
feels
a
great
fertility
of
imagination and
flow of
ideas clothed in a ready
succession
of happy phrases, and, as one must get
up in order to write, he dresses himself, and throwing
off his night-cap, sits down at his writing-table.
But
lo
!
all at once he
is a different
individual.
The warmth of imagination has disappeared
;
the
thread of the ideas
is broken
; there is a great lack
of expression
; he
is obliged
to hunt up with diffi-
culty the thoughts which he had
so
easily found,
and frequently he feels forced to put off* his task to
a more propitious day.
Such facts can be easily explained by considering
how
the
brain
is
influenced
by
the
change
of
position and temperature; at all events, it is another
proof that the body
influences the
mind.
Follow-
ing
out
this
idea,
I am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
excitability
of
the
Mahomedans
and
other
Orientals is due to the fact that they have the head
always covered with the warm turban, and
that
it
is to obtain a contrary effect that in monasteries the
religious legislators have imposed the rule of keep-
ing that part of the body uncovered and shaven.

ON EEST, SLEEP, AND DEEAMS, AS THEY
AEE INFLUENCED BY DIET.
Whether
reposing,
resting, or
di’eaming, man
is
still
constantly under
the
power
of
the
laws
of
nutrition, and within the domain of gastronomy.
Theory and experience combine to prove that the
quality and
quantity
of our
food
has
a
powerful
influence upon work, rest, sleep, and dreams.

fed man

soon
all
strength leaves him
;
rest, in his case, is simply an
utter impossibility of action.
If
it
is mental labour
that occupies him, ideas
arise
without
force
or
precision.
His
reflection
refuses to combine them,
his judgment to analyse
them.
The
brain
exhausts
itself
in
such
vain
attempts
; and he
falls
asleep,
as
it
w'ere, on
the
field of battle.
On the eve
of
his
departure
for Boulogne, the
Emperor
Napoleon
was
at
work
for
more
than
thirty hours—what with tho Council

the other depositaries of his power—and the only
refreshment he had was two very short meals and
several cnps of coffee.
Brown
tells
us
of
an
English
clerk
of
the
Admiralty
who,
after
accidentally
losing
some
registers which could only he prepared by himself,
was occupied
for
fifty consecutive hours
in getting
them
done
a
second
time.
Without
a
suitable
regimen, he could never have dared to attempt such
an enormous loss of energy
; and the following was
the way in which he kejpt up
;
first by taking water,
then
light
food,
then
wine,
then good
soup, and
finally oj)ium.
One day
I met a courier whom
I had formerly
known in the army. He had just arrived from Spain
where he had been sent with State
despatches, and
had
only
taken
twelve
days
to
accomplish
the
journey.
A few glasses of wine and a few' bowls of
soup were
all that he had taken during that long
series of joltings and sleepless days
; and he added
that any
food
of
a more
substantial
kind would
have infallibly rendered him incapable of continuing
his route.
Food has a by no means unimportant influence
upon sleep and dreaming.
He who requires
to eat cannot sleep.
The pangs of hunger

ness; and
if weakness and exhaustion compel him
to
dose,
the
sleep
is
light
and
broken,
without
repose.
He
who,
on
the
contrary,
has
in
his
eating
exceeded the bounds of discretion, falls immediately
into a
state
of absolute
repose.
Should he have
dreamed, there remains no recollection, because the
nervous
fluid
has been
passing
to and
fro
in
all
directions.
For
the
same
reason,
he
awakes
suddenly,
and
has
difficulty
in
coming
back
to
social life
; and even when fully awake he still feels
for a considerable time the languor of indigestion.
It may
be
accepted
as a
general maxim
that
coffee
drives
away
sleep.
This
inconvenience,
which
is
invariably
experienced
at
first
by
Europeans,
is
weakened by
custom,
or even
dis-
appears
altogether.
There
are
several
kinds
of
food
which have
the
contrary
effect
of
inducing
sleep
:
such
as
those
that
are
milky, as
all
the
lettuce family
of plants,
poultry, purslain, orange-
flower, and especially the rennet apple, when eaten
immediately before going to bed.
Experience, founded upon millions of observations,
has taught us that dreams are determined
by
food.
In
general, they are caused by
food which
has
properties
only
slightly
exciting,
such
as
dark-coloured
flesh, pigeons, ducks, game.

and
especially hare.
That property
is
also recog-
nized
in asparagus,
celery, truffles, scented
sweets,
and particularly vanilla.
It would
be
a
great mistake
to think that
all
such somniferous substances must be banished from
our tables,
for the dreams which they occasion
are
generally light and pleasant, prolonging our
exist-
ence even diu’ing the time when
it appears to be
suspended.
There are some persons
for whom sleep
is a
life
apart—a
sort of prolonged romance
; that is to say,
that their dreams follow each other, and they finish
the
second
night what they had commenced
the
night
before,
seeing
in
their
sleep
certain
faces
which they recognize
as already
seen, and which,
nevertheless, they
have
never met
in
the
actual
world.
The man who has
reflected on
the
life
of the
body,
and
conducts
it
in
accordance
with
the
principles now being developed, will wisely prepare
his
rest,
his sleep, and
his dreams.
He distributes
his work so as never to have too much on hand
; he
lightens
it by
skilfully varying
it
;
and
refreshes
his energy by short
intervals of rest, which
relieve
without any interruption of the continuity which is
sometimes
indispensable.
If during the day time
a longer rest
is needed, he takes it only in a sitting

posture,
refraining
from
sleep
unless
absolutely
compelled to give way to
it, and being especially
careful not to contract a habit of it.
When night brings the hours
of daily
rest, he
retires to an airy room, does not surround himself
with curtains to make him breathe the same air a
hundred times, and takes good care not to close his
window-shutters,
so
that
every time
his
eye
half
opens he may be consoled by a remnant of light.
He stretches himself on a bed which rises slightly
towards the
head
;
his pillow
is of horse-hair,
his
night-cap of linen
;
his chest
is not weighed down
by a weight of bed-clothes, but he takes good care
that his feet are warmly covered.
He has eaten with discrimination, denying him-
self neither good nor excellent cheer ; he has drunk
the best wines, and with precaution, even though of
the
finest
quality.
During
dessert, he
talks more
about
gallantry than
politics, and composes love-
songs rather than epigrams.
Afterwards, he takes a
cup of tea if it suits his constitution, and soon after-
wards a thimbleful of liqueur, to give the mouth a
pleasant flavour.
In everything, he shows himself a
pleasant guest, a distinguished connoisseur, without
scarcely ever going beyond the limits of his natural
wants.
It
is under such circumstances that he goes to

pleased with himself and every one
else,
and, closing his eyes, passes through the twilight of
consciousness, and falls into a state of several hours’
absolute repose.
Nature has not been long in levying her tribute,
and by
assimilation
all
loss
is
replaced.
Then
pleasant dreams come
to bestow upon him a mys-
terious existence
;
he
sees persons whom he loves,
recovers
his
favourite
occupations, and
is
for
the
moment carried to places of which he has pleasant
recollections.
At
last,
feeling himself gradually emerge from
the state
of sleep, he again enters upon
social
life
without any regret for time lost, because in his sleep
he has enjoyed an
activity without fatigue, and a
pleasure without alloy.

In
the mean time,
I proceed
to open the new
career
; for a discussion of corpulence is indispensable
in a wt)i’k which treats of all that relates to the food
of man.
By corpulence,
I mean that
state
of
fatty con-
gestion in which, without the individual being
ill,
the bodily members gradually become larger, and
lose their original form and symmetry.
I,
myself, am among the number of the
gastro-
phori, or paunch-bellied, my leg
and ankle being
firm and sinewy
as
those
of an Arab.
But
this
local tendency to corpulence I had always regarded
with special dread, and I conquered
it by confining
it to the limit of the imposing.
To conquer it, how-
ever, a
fight was
first necessary, and
it
is
to my
thirty
years’ struggle that
this present essay owes
any merit that may belong to
it.

To introduce the
subject, I shall give a specimen
of
one
of
the numberless discussions
in
which
I
formerly took part at table with any one threatened
with corpulence, or suffering from
it.

Limet, in Eue de Eichelieu. He supplies

; but
I send there because
it

continue doing
so because
I have
pro-
claimed
him to
be

in
the
world.

I must take a note of his address.
I am a
great eater of bread, and with such rolls as those
I
could almost dispense with everything else.
Another S. P. What in the world are you doing ?
Are you actually leaving that beautiful rice in your
soup-plate, and eating only the liquid ?
M.
It is a special régime that I prescribe to my-
self.
S. P.
’Tis a bad one, then.
Eice I am very fond
of, as well
as
flours, pastry, and things of that sort.
There is nothing that nourishes better,
cheaper, or
with less trouble.
A very S. P. Will you oblige me,
sir, by passing
the potatoes in front of you
;
at the rate they are
going at, I am afraid of not being in time.
M.
There, sir, they are within your reach.

8. P. But you will surely help youi-self to some ?
There’s enough for both, and those who come after
must do as they may.
M.

I think nothing
of the
potato unless
as a stop-gap in times of great scar-
city.
It is, to my taste, most insipid.

There

Lady. Would
you

light thrown upon a theory which, in a rudimentary
form,
I had seen
verified in the lower animals—to
wit, that corpulence by fattening
is mainly due to
food
which
is
overcharged
with
feculent
and
farinaceous
elements.
Thus,
also,
I became
con-
vinced that the same regimen is always followed b}’
the same effect.
As a matter
of
fact, carnivorous animals never
become
fat
;
for example,
wolves, jackals,
birds
of
prey, the
crow,
etc.
Herbivorous
animals
fatten
slightly,
at
least
so long
as age has not brought
them
to a
state of comparative repose
; and on the
other hand, they invariably
fatten quickly as soon
as they
are
fed on
potatoes, corn, or
any kind
of
flour.

ON COBPULENCE.

Corpulence never occurs
either amongst savages
or
those
classes
of
society who work only
to
eat
and eat only to live.
From
the preceding
observations, the
accuracy
of which any man can verify for himself, it
is
easy
to
assign the
principal
causes of corpu-
Iciicc*
corpulence.
The
first
is the natural
dis-
position
of the
individual.
Almost every man
is
born with certain predispositions of which his phy-
siognomy
hears
the
stamp.
Out
of
a
hundred
persons who die of consumption, ninety have brown
or
fair
hair, a long
face and sharp
nose.
Out
of
a hundred who are corpulent, there are ninety with
a short face, round eyes, and blunt nose.
When in company we meet with a young girl who
is
lively, with
rosy complexion, a
roguish
nose, a
well-rounded figure, plump hands, and short, plump
feet, everybody
is
delighted
and
pronounces
her
charming
; whereas
I, being taught by
experience,
look upon her with
anticipations of ten years later,
and seeing the ravages which corpulence
is sure
to
cause,
I groan
over
evils not
yet
existing.
Such
anticipated pity
is a painful
feeling, and
supplies
one
proof
against
a
thousand
others
that
man
would he more unhappy
if
he
could
foresee
the
future.
The second and principal cause
of corpulence
is

184
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
in
the
flours
and
other
farinaceous
stuffs
which
constitute the
basis
of man’s
daily
food.
As we
have already remarked,
all animals which
live on
farinaceous food must become fat, and man follows
the common law.
Feculent food is quicker and truer
in
its
effects
when combined
with
sugar.
Both sugar and
fat
contain the element hydrogen
: thus both are com-
bustive.
So composed, it
is
active in proportion as
it pleases the palate
; and few eat
of sweets before
the natural appetite
is
satisfied, and the luxnrious
appetite alone
is
left which
requires
for
its grati-
fication the most refined art and ingenious variety.
Farinaceous matter
is
not
less
fattening
when
conveyed by means of drinks, such ’as beer.
Those
races who
drink
it habitually
are
also those who
can
show
the
largest
paunches:
thus,
in
1817,
several Parisian
families drank beer
for economy,
because wine
was
very
dear, and the
result
was,
they got
so
stout that they
scarcely knew them-
selves.
Another
cause
of
corpulency
is
twofold,
viz.,
that due
to taking too much sleep and
too
little
exercise.
During sleep the human body is greatly
restored, there
being scarcely any
loss, on account
of the muscular
action being suspended.
Hence
the necessity
for
exercise
to use up
the surplus
;

ON COBFULENCE.
185
but by tbe very
fact
of
sleeping much, the time
of action
is
proportionately
limited.
Then, again,
great
sleepers
recoil
from
whatever
gives
the
slightest
fatigue, and thus the
excess
of what
is
assimilated
is conveyed by
the
current
of
circu-
lation, and
a
small percentage
of hydrogen being
added by one of the mysterious processes of organic
chemistry, fat
is formed and deposited
in
the
cel-
lular tissue.
Finally, too much eating and drinking is a cause
of corpulence.
There is much truth
in the saying
that one of the privileges of the human race
is to
eat without being hungry, and drink without being
thirsty;
for,
as a matter
of
fact,
it
cannot be an
attribute of the lower animals, since
it
arises from
reflection upon the pleasures of the table, and from
the desire to prolong them.
Wherever men are found, we also find this twofold
liking;
and
it
is well known
that savages
eat
to
excess, and drink till they are dead drunk, as often
as they have the opportunity.
Nay, we
ourselves,
whether
citizens
of the Old
or
the New World,
though we believe we have reached the very
cul-
mination
of
civilization,
most
assuredly
eat
too
much.
I do not
refer to that small number who,
from avarice or incapacity, live alone and apart

crease, tlie latter groaning because they cannot do
better
; but I speak so emphatically
of
all those in
ordinary
society who
are
alternately Amj^hitryons
and
guests,
inviting
or
invited.
All
these, even
after the actual wants of nature are
satisfied, eat of
a dish because it is
attractive, and drink
of a wine
because it is foreign.
I
affirm
that, w'hether
enter-
ing
a
dining-room
every
day,
or
only
having
a
treat of a Sunday, and oceasionally on the Monday,
the great majority of us eat and drink
too much
;
and enormous
quantities
of eatables are daily ab-
sorbed unnecessarily.
This almost universal cause has
different results
aecording to the constitution of the individuals; and
for people of weak stomachs its result
is not corpu-
lence, but indigestion.
We have with our own eyes seen an instance well

table was concerned, but
his
digestion by no means corresponded to
his love of
good eating.
As host he did the honours to perfec-
tion, and did his share of the eating with a courage
worthy of a better fate.
Thus
all went well enough
to
the
conclusion
of
the
dinner
;
but
then
the
stomach speedily
refused the labour imposed upon
it, and pains began, till the luckless gastronome was

obliged to throw himself on a sofa, where he lay till
next day expiating by protracted agony the short
pleasure which he had enjoyed.
A very singular
point
in
this
case was that he
never got
rid
of
this
peculiarity.
So
long
as he
lived he was subject to the strange
alternative, and
the previous evening’s sufferings never changed or
modified
his
eonduct at
the dinner
table
on the
morrow.
With men of good
digestion, the excess of nutri-
tion
acts as indicated in the previous
artiele.
All
the food is digested, and that which is not needed to
repair loss is appropriated in the form of fat.
With
others there
is a constant indigestion, the stomach
receiving
the food without
benefit
to them
;
and
those ignorant
of the
cause
are astonished
that a
better
result
is
not
produced
by
so many good
things.
The reader must
observe that I do not go
ex-
haustively
into
details;
for
there
is a
crowd
of
secondary causes—arising from our habits, from the
limitations imposed by our
condition
in
life, from
our
hobbies
and
our
pleasures—all
seeonding
or
actuating
those
which
I
have
just
pointed
out.
Such
full
and minute treatment of the subject
I
leave to the successor of whom
I spoke at the com-
mencement of the chapter, contenting myself, as the

first pioneer in this
field, with my right of gather-
ing the firstfruits.
Intemperance has for ages
fixed the attention
of
observers.
Philosophers have extolled temperance
;
princes
have made
laws
to
limit
expenses
;
and
religion has preached
at the
love
of good
living.
Alas
! they have not lessened the amount eaten by
a single mouthful, and the art
of eating
too much
becomes every day more flourishing.
By striking out a new path
I
shall, perhaps, be
more
fortunate.
I
shall
set
forth
the
physical
inconveniences of corpulence.
The
instinct of
self-
preservation may be more powerful than morality,
more persuasive than sermonizing, and more
effec-
tive than the law.
At any
rate, the
fair sex
are, I
believe,
quite
willing
to
open
their
eyes
to
the
light.
Corpulence is looked upon
as an enemy by both
sexes, because strength and beauty are both

more
than
others,
and
still
more
by
filling up
depressions which nature had intended
for showing
the other features in
relief.
Hence
it
is an every-
day occurrence to meet a face formerly most
attrac-
tive, and now by corpulence become almost insigni-
ficant.
The
head
of
our
late
Empire
was
himself an
instance.
In his last campaigns he had grown very
corpulent,
his
paleness becoming
almost
ghastly,
and his eyes losing much of their fire.
Two
other
notable
instances
of
corpulence
are
Marius and, in modern times, John Sobieski.
The
former, being of short stature, became as broad as he
was high
; and it was probably this disproportionate
growth
that
frightened
his
Cimbrian
executioner.
As
to
the Eing
of
Poland, his
corpulence
very
nearly cost him his
life
;
for having fallen amongst
a
troop
of
Turkish
cavalry,
before whom he was
obliged to flee, he soon became short of breath, and
would certainly have been slaughtered
if several of
his staff had not kept him
up, almost
fainting, on
the saddle, whilst others were generously sacrificing
themselves in order to hinder the enemy.
If I am not mistaken, the Due de Vendôme, that
worthy son
of the
great Henry, also became
veiy
corpulent.
Dying
in an
inn,
deserted by
every-
body,
he remained
conscious enough

perceive

190
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
one
of
his
people
snatching
the
cushion
from
under his head, even when about
to
utter his
last
sigh.
With
reference
to
instances of excessive
corpu-
lence, I
shall
confine myself to a few remarks from
my own observations.
M. Rameau, a school-fellow,
afterwards mayor of La
Chaleur, in Burgundy, was
only
five
feet
six
inches
high,
yet
he
weighed
five hundred pounds.
The Due de Luynes, whom
I have frequently met
in company, became
enor-
mously
large, his
handsome
features
being
quite
disfigured by fat, and the last years of his life being
spent in an almost uninterrupted sleep.
But the most extraordinary instance
I have seen
was
that
of
an
inhabitant
of New
York, whom
many of my readers must have seen
sitting in the
Broadway,
on
an
enormous
arm-chair
with
legs
strong enough
to
bear a church.
Edward was at
least
six
feet four
in
height
;
and, as
his fat had
swelled him
out
in
every
direction, he
was
over
eight
feet at least in girth.
His
fingers were
like
those of the Roman Emperor who
used
his
wife’s
bracelets
for
rings
;
his
arms
and
thighs
were
cylindrical,
as
thick
as the
waist
of
an
ordinary
man
; and his feet like those of an elephant, covered
w'ith
the overlapping
fat
of
the
legs.
His lower
eyelid was kept down by the weight of the
fat on

ON CORFULENOE.
191
his cheeks
; hut what made him more hideous than
anything
else was
the
three round
chins of more
than a foot long hanging over his breast, so that his
face looked like the capital of a truncated pillar.
He sat thus beside a window of a low room open-
ing on the street, drinking from time to time a glass
of ale, of which there was a huge
pitcher always
near.
His singular appearance
could not
fail to attract
the
notice
of the
passers-by, but
they had
to be
careful not
to remain
too
long.
Edward
quickly
sent them
about
their business, calling out, in his
deep
tones, “What
are
you
staring
at, like wild
cats ? ”—“ Go on your way, you lazy body ”—“ Off
with
you,
you
good-for-nothing
dogs.”
During
several
conversations
I had
with
him, he assured
me that he was by no means unhappy, and that
if
death did not come
to disturb his
plans, he could
willingly
remain
as
he
was
to
the
end
of
the
world.
From all that has been advanced in this chapter,
we must conclude that if corpulence is not Condu-
a
disease, it
is
at
least a troublesome in-
disposition brought on
mostly by
our own
fault.
Another conclusion is that corpulence
is a thing
to
be guarded against by those who are free of
it, and
got rid of by those who have it
; and
it
is in their

1 92

favour
that
we now
proceed
to
investigate
the
resources
which
science,
aided
by
observation,
presents to us.
XXII.
OX THE PEEVENTIOX OK CUKE OF
COKPULENCE.
I COMMENCE with a
fact which proves that corpu-
lence can
neither
be prevented nor cured without
determination.
M.
Louis
Greffulhe
(afterwards
Count)
being
threatened with corpulence, came to ask my advice,
having
heard
that I had given
attention
to
the
subject.
“ On one condition,” I said, “namely, that
you promise on your word of honour to follow with
the most rigid accuracy the rule of conduct which
I prescribe.”
Having so pledged himself, I next day presented
my list of rules—the
first article being that he was
to have himself weighed at the begiunmg and end
of the treatment.
At the end of a month he called
upon me
again, and
gave me
the
result
in
tlie
following terms.
“ I have followed your prescription
as if my life

PREVENTION OB CUBE OF CORPULENCE.
1 93
depended upon it, and have ascertained that during
the month
I have
lost
three pounds and
a
little
over.
But to reach that result I have been obliged
to do such violence to all my tastes, all my
habits
—in a word, I have
suffered so much, that, whilst
giving you my best thanks for your kind directions,
I renounce any advantage resulting from them, and
throw myself for the future entirely into the hands
of Providence.”
After this resolution, which I did not hear with-
out
pain, the
result
was
as might
be
expected
:
]\I. Greffulhe
grew
more
and more
corpulent, and
after
suffering
the
inconveniences
due to such a
habit, had
scarcely reached the age of forty when
he died of suffocation.
Every cure of corpulence must begin with these
three maxims or absolute principles:
dis-
General
cretion
in
eating,
moderation
in
sleep,
exercise on foot or horseback.
Now, firstly, much resolution
is needed
to leave
the
dinner-table
with
an
appetite.
Whilst
the
craving
lasts, one morsel
invites another with
an
irresistible
attraction, and,
as a general
rule, men
eat as long as they are hungry, in
spite
of doctors,
and even by the example of the doctors.
Secondly, to propose to any of our
stout friends
to rise early is the veriest cruelty.
They will plead
o

194
OA8TEONOMY AS A FINE ART.
that their health does not allow of
it;
that when
they get up
early, they are good
for nothing the
rest of the day
; and
if a
lady, she
will complain
that
it ruins the
eyes.
They will
all agree to
sit
up late, but must have their morning snooze.
Thus,
then, the second resource is lost.
Thirdly,
exercise on
horseback
is an expensive
cure,
suitable neither for
all incomes nor
all con-
ditions
of
life.
Thus,
if the
patient be a pretty
woman, she
will gladly
assent
;
but on
three con-
ditions
: that she may have a horse at once hand-
some,
spirited, and
gentle
;
that she may have a
riding-habit cut in the
latest fashion
; and that she
may have a good-natured and handsome fellow
to
act as her squire.
Foot exercise also meets with a host of objections.
It
tires one
to
death;
one
is apt to perspire and
catch pleurisy
;
the
dust
ruins
one’s
stockings, or
the stones
one’s thin shoes
; and it is impossible to
keep it up.
Of all medical
resources, the

consequence,

A
few
precepts
must
be
added for those who are already victims.
Drink
every summer
thirty
bottles
of
seltzer
water
; a large tumbler the
first thing in the morn-
ing, two others before
lunch, and the same at bed-
time.
Drink white wines, especially those that are
light and acid, like that of Anjou, and avoid beer as
you would the plague.
Ask frequently for radishes,
artichokes with hot sauce, asparagus, celery
; choose
veal and
fowl rather than
beef and mutton
; and
eat as
little
of
the

as
possible.
When
doubtful, take the advice
of a doctor who
follows my principles;
and at whatever stage you
begin to adopt it, you will speedily improve in fresh-
ness, good looks, activity, health, and general fitness.

doctrine
prevalent
amongst
women that

are

for

cause leanness, but it is at the expense of the fresh-

life
; and
to prove this
statement of a truth which
I think cannot be too
widely known, I give an instance from my own per-
sonal observation.

pbevention or cure of corpulence.
197
In
1776, when a student
at
Dijon, I formed an
intimate acquaintance with
a young
lady, one
of
the prettiest
girls I have
ever known, and
all the
more from having that fulness of form, or classical
enibonp>oint, which is one of the glories of the imita-
tive
arts.
One evening
I
said
to
her, “My dear
Louise,
you
are
surely
ill
;
you
look
thinner
! ”
“ Oh no
! ”
she
replied, with a
sort
of melancholy
smile
; “lam quite well, and if I am a little thinner,
I
can
very
well
afford
it.”
“ Afford
it
! ”
said
I,
angrily,
“there
is
no
need
for you being
either
thinner
or stouter
;
keep
as you
are,
a charming
morsel,” and other phrases of that sort suitable to a
youth of twenty.
Watching the young
girl from that time, I soon
saw a
loss
of colour, the cheeks becoming
hollow,
and
her charms
generally
fading.
Alas
! what a
frail and fleeting thing beauty is
!
At last, meeting
her at an evening
party, she confessed to me that,
after
feeling annoyed by some of her companions
making fun of her and saying that in two years she
would be
as
fat as
Saint
Christopher, she had for
the past month been drinking a
glass
of vinegar
every morning.
A shudder passed through me at this confession.
I felt the extent of the danger, and next morning I
told her mother, whose alarm was equal to mine, for

she was dotingly fond of her daughter.
ISTo time was
lost
; the best doctors were
called, and consultations
held and remedies
tried
; hut
all too
late—for at
the age of eighteen Louise fell asleep for evermore.
About
a week
after
her
death,
her
despairing
mother begged me to accompany her in paying the
last
visit to what remained
of
her daughter,
and
we saw with surprise that the face showed a sort of
radiance, or
ecstasy, which had not appeared
pre-
viously.
I was
astonished, and the mother drew
from
it a
favourable
augury.
It
is
not, however,
rare,
and
there
is
mention
of
it
in
Lavater’s
“ Treatise on Physiognomy.”
Every system of treatment

Such
are
the

with which I

to
combat an
inconvenience
as troublesome
as
it
is
common.
I have adapted them to the weakness
of
humanity, such
as we
find
it
in the present state
of society.
For that purpose I have acted on that principle
of experience, that the more rigorous any system of
treatment is, the less is the effect produced, because
followed badly or not at all.
Few patients will make a great effort.
Hence, if
you wish your advice to be followed, you must pre-

is easy, or even,
if possible, what
is pleasant.

was

to take a heavy

the

to
the

The
whole
secret
of
gaining
some
fulness
of
figure
lies
in
the proper choice of
diet.
What is
needed is but to eat and select one’s food.
If you sleep much, that

;
if you
sleep

will
digest more quickly
and therefore eat more.
Let us now sketch one
day’s
bill
of
fare
for
a
young
sylph, or
other airy creature, who wishes to
assume a more material form.
First of all, make it
a
general
rule
to
eat
nothing but
newly baked
bread, especially the crumb, and plenty of it.
In the morning, before leaving your room, take a
small basin of soup, or a cup of good chocolate.
At
eleven
o’clock,
breakfast
upon
newly
laid
eggs,
either beaten up
or poached, and a pie or cutlet, or
anything you can fancy
; the main point is to have
cup of coffee also will do no harm.

202
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
After breakfast, you must take some exercise.
If
you don’t care for the parks or gardens, pay a visit
to
your
dressmaker,
or
go
and
see
the
newest
bonnets
and
latest
styles
of
cloaks
and
shawls,
finishing off by calling on one or two of your friends
to have a chat about what you have seen.
At dinner, take
as much
soup, fish, and meat as
you like, taking care not to omit any dish
contain-
ing rice or macaroni, also sweet pastry, “ Charlottes,”
and so forth
; and during the dessert choose Savoy
cakes, currant-tarts, and such like, containing
flour,
eggs, and sugar.
In drinking, beer should be preferred, and
if you
must have wine, take Bordeaux, or some other from
the
sunny
South.
Shun
acids,
unless
in
salads,
which
gladden
the heart;
take
sugar with
your
fruit, and
eat
as many grapes
as you can.
Never
take baths too
cold,
or
tire yourself dancing, but
use your endeavoiu’s from time
to time to breathe
the pure air of the country.
If
this scheme be followed
diligently and
reso-
lutely, the
deficiencies of nature will soon be made
good,
the
health
will be improved as well as the
beauty, and
thus, pleasure being yielded by both,
my professional ear will ring with accents of grati-

XXIV.
ON FASTING.
Fasting
consists
in
a
voluntary abstinence
from
food,
for some moral
or
religious
purpose.
The
habit
has
within my own
recollection
singularly
fallen
into
desuetude;
and,
as
it may
serve
for
the
edification,
if
not
the
conversion, of impious
moderns,
I
cannot
refrain
from
sketching
the
ordinary life of
fifty years ago.
On
ordinary
days
we
breakfasted
before
nine
upon bread, cheese, fruits, sometimes a pie
or cold
meat.
Between
twelve and one
o’clock we dined,
always beginning, as a matter of course, with soup,
and followed by the meat boiled in it, supplemented
by
other
dishes,
according
to
one’s
income
and
other circumstances.
About four there was a small
snack for the use of children and those who prided
themselves
on
adherence
to
old
customs
;
about
eight came supper, a meal of four
or
five courses,

204
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
and then, after
conversation and a game
at
cards,
all went to bed.
Let us now glance at what was done on the days
of fasting.
Butchers’-meat was forbidden
; we had
no
breakfast, and were
consequently more hungry
than
usual.
At
the
regular hour we dined as we
best might
; but fish and vegetables only satisfy for
the moment, and before
five o’clock we were dying
with
hunger, some
looking
at
their
watches and
trying to be patient, others working themselves into
a passion, even when securing their soul’s salvation.
About eight o’clock we at length had, not a good
supper, but “ the collation,”
as
it was termed (by a
name
borrowed
from
the
self-denying monks), at
which we could be served neither with butter, nor
eggs, nor anything which had had
life.
We were
fain, then, to take
our
fill
of
salad, preserves and
fruits—aliments,
alas
! by no means suited
to the
appetites of those times and circumstances
; but we
exercised our souls in patience for the love of heaven,
went to bed, and next morning, all throughout Lent,
recommenced the same programme.
For the
relaxation
of
that rigorous
observance
many
causes
are
assigned,
the
culminating
one
being the Kevolution.
Still, it is a gross mistake to
think that the new
order of
things
has
fostered
intemperance,
for the number

205
reduced, and
drunkenness has disappeared
to take
refuge amongst the lowest classes of society.
Wild
orgies
are now unheard
of, and a man
of
sottish
habits would he tabooed.
Every day many thousand men attend the theatre
or
café, who
forty years ago would have spent the
same time in the public-houses.
Their manners are
improved by the
stage, and
their minds instructed
at the coffee-houses by reading newspapers ; and, in
any
case, they are saved from the fighting, the ill-
health and the brutishness which seem inseparable
from the public-houses.
XXV.
ON EXHAUSTION AND DEATH.
By exhaustion we mean a state of weakness, languor,
or
sinking, which
is caused by
excess
of work
or
loss of energy, and impedes the action of the vital
functions.
For
its treatment gastronomy is ever at hand to
present
her
resources.
To
the man who has
too
long put a
strain
upon
his
muscular
forces,
she
offers good
soup, generous
wine, cooked
meat, and
sleep.
To the man
of learning, who through love

of
his
subject
has been tempted
to
overtask
his
powers, she offers exercise in the open
air to refresh
his brain, a bath to relax the irritated nerves, fowl,
vegetables, and repose.
In death there is an absolute annihilation of the
vital
functions, which
in
exhaustion
are
only im-
peded, the body being therefore abandoned to the
laws of decomjDosition.
Like other critical acts in human existence, death
itself
is
not unaccompanied by pleasure when
it
is
natural;
that
is, when
the body
has
duly
jjassed
through the different phases of growth
: manhood,
old age, and
decrepitude.
I might call to my aid
the physicians who have noted through what imper-
ceptible
shades
or
gradations
an
animated
body
passes into the state of inert matter.
I might quote
philosofthers,
kings, men
of
letters,
who, on
the
confines of eternity, far from being a prey to grief,
had their minds filled with pleasant thoughts, some-
times
enhanced by the charm of poetry.
I might
bring to mind that reply of the dying Fontenelle,
who, being asked what he felt, said,
“ Nothing but a
difficulty of living.”
The
following
is one
of the
instances on which I base my conviction.
I had a grand-aunt of ninety-three years old, who
was dying.
Though
for some time confined to her
bed, she had
all her
faculties, and
it was only by

the
loss
of
appetite and
weakening
of her voice
that her
real state could he seen.
She had always
shown great affection for me, and
I was by her bed-
side ready
to wait tenderly upon her, at the same
time taking observations with that philosophic eye
with which I have always scanned all that happens
aroimd me.
“ Art thou by me ? ”
said she, in a voice scarcely
intelligible.
“ Yes, aunt
;
can
I
do
anything
for
you ?
I
think a
little
wine would do you good.”
“ Let me try then, my boy
; a liquid will always go
down.”
I
got
it
as
quickly
as
I
could, and
lifting her
gently, made her swallow
half a
glass of my best
wine.
She instantly revived, and, turning upon me
eyes that had been very handsome, said,
“ I thank
you
kindly
for
this
last good
turn;
if ever you
reach my
age, you
will
see
that death becomes a
want, just like sleep.”
These were her last words, and half an hour after-
wards she had fallen asleep for ever.

PHILOSOPHICAL HISTOEY OF COOXEEY.
Cookery
is not only the most ancient of the
arts,
but
it
has
rendered more
important
services
to
society than any other.
For it was by the prepara-
tion of his food that man learned how to use
fire,
and it is by fire that he has subdued nature.
,,
Man
is an omnivorous animal
; he has

grains, and dog-teeth to tear flesh.
It is extremely probable that the species was for
a
long time necessarily fruit-eating, being
inferior
to the other animals, and but poorly provided with
means
of attack.
Inborn
instinct
of self-improve-
ment, however, became
speedily developed, and the
very
consciousness
of weakness suggested
the use
of arms,
to which
he was
also urged
by
his
car-
nivorous instinct
; and as soon as he was armed, the
animals around him became his prey and his food.
There are
still
traces of this
instinct of destruc-
tion.
Infants are almost certain
to
kill any little
animals over which they have full power, and would
no doubt eat them if hungry.

;
otherwise, it
is not at
all unpleasant to
taste.
Seasoned
with
a
little
salt,
it
is
easily
digested, and must be at least as nourishing as any
other.
Dining with a captain of Croats in 1815, “ Gad,”
said he,
“ there’s no need of so much fuss in order
to have a good dinner
! When we are on scout duty
and feel hungry, we shoot down the first beast that
comes
in our
Avay, and
cutting
out a good

slice,
we
sprinkle some
salt
over
it, place
it be-

gallop for a sufficent time, and ” (working his jaws
like a man eating large mouthfuls)
“ gniaw, gniaio,
gniaw, we have a dinner
fit for a prince.”
Similarly, when
sportsmen
in Dauphiné
go out
shooting in September, they are provided with pep-
per and salt, and if one kills a fig-pecker, he plucks
and seasons
it, carries it
for some time
in
his
cap,
and then
eats
it.
They declare that these
birds,
when so dressed, eat better than if roasted.
Moreover, if our great-grandfathers ate their food
raw, we have not yet
entirely given up the
habit.
The most delicate palate will make

it to
be used
in
preparing
food,
first of
all, by roasting on hot embers.
Thus was
imparted a savoury flavour, which continues
still to
be
attractive.
Afterwards,
skewers
were
used
to
hold the meat above the embers, being supported
on
each
side by
stones of
a suitable
height
;
an
improvement which
in due time suggested the art
of grilling or broiling.
Things were scarcely further advanced than
this
in
the time
of Homer; and
I
trust
it
will
be
a
pleasure
at
this stage to read how Achilles enter-
tained
in
his
tent
three of the
principal Grecian
chiefs, one a king.
I recommend the passage to my
lady readers
especially,
because Achilles was
the
most
handsome
of the
Greeks,
and
was
not
too
proud to shed
tears when deprived by force of the
fair Briseis.
“ Son of Menootius, set upon tlie 1)001(1

Patroclus kindled then a blazing fire
:
And when the fire burnt down, and when the flame
Subsided, spread the glowing embers out,
And hung the spits above
; then sprinkled o’er
The meat with salt, and lifted from the stand
The viands cooked and placed upon the board ;
From baskets fair Patroclus portioned out
The bread to each
; the meat Achilles shared.
Facing the sage Ulysses, sat the host
Against the other wall
; and bade his friend,
Patroclus, give the Gods their honour due;
He in the fire the wonted offerings burnt
:
They to the food prepared their hands addressed
:
But when their thirst and hunger were appeased
Ajax to Phœnix signed
: Ulysses saw
The sign, and rising, filled a cup with wine,
And pledged Achilles thus
:
“ To thee I drink,
Achilles
1
Nobly is thy table spread,
As heretofore in Agamemnon’s tent.
So now in thine
; abundant is the feast.”
Lord Derby’s Iliad of Uomer, ix. 238.
Thus a king,
a
king’s
son,
and
three
Grecian
chiefs made a good dinner upon broiled
flesh, with
bread and wine. That Achilles and Patroclus should
themselves have part in preparing the banquet, was,
no
doubt, exceptional, and
in order
to do
greater
honour
to their distinguished
guests.
For
in
the
“Odyssey” Homer describes the duties of dressing
food
as
usually
devolving
upon
the women
and
slaves.
During the same epoch, and doubtless long before,
poetry and music were associated with the pleasures
of the table.
Ancient minstrels celebrated the mar-

Such

formed
a
sort of
priesthood, under some of whom the divine Homer
himself was probably trained.
He could not have
risen
to
such
eminence
had
his
poetical
studies
not begun in early youth.
Madame Dacier observes that Homer never makes
any mention of boiled meat in any part of his works.
The Jews were more advanced, on account of having
lived
for a considerable time in Egypt; they had
vessels to stand
fire, and
it was
in some such pot
that the soup was made which Jacob sold so dear
to his brother Esau.

It
came

adopted,
however,

Athens, and

the

Cookery and
its pleasures were in great
repute
among the Athenians, a people of elegant
Grecian
taste and eager
for novelty.
Kings, pri-
banquets,
vate men of wealth, poets, and men of science gave
the example
; and even the
philosophers believed
it a duty to share the enjoyments drawn from the
bosom of nature.
From what we read

is no doubt
their

The songs introduced

love, with a sweetness and harmony not to be

and
at
certain
banquets
it
was
the custom,
contrary
to
that
of
modern days, to have the
glasses larger
in propor-
tion as the wine was bettor.
In those assemblies, where sensuous and æsthetic
enjoyment were combined, an important element was
the presence of the most beautiful women.
Dances,
gumes, and amusements of very sort, prolonged the
pleasures of the evening.
They breathed pleasure
at every
pore, and many an
Aristippus,
arriving
under the banner of Plato, retired as a follower of
Epicurus.
Their learned showed their good-will by writing
on an
art
so conducive
to
pleasure
; and
though,
alas
! those works are lost, their names are preserved
by Plato, Athenæus, and others.
Most of all must
we
regret
the
poem
on
gastronomy
by
Arche-
stratus, a
friend
of
one
of
Pericles’
sons.
“This
great
writer,” we are
told, “ had traversed sea and
land
to make
acquaintance
with
the
best
things
they
produced.
During
his
travels,
he
did
not
make
inquiry
into
the
manners
of
nations,
since
they always remain the
same, but going
into the
laboratories where the
delicacies
of the
table
are
prepared, he only held
intercourse with those who
could
advance
his
pleasures.
His
poem
is
a
treasure of science, and every line a precept.”

FlIILOSOPmCAL HISTORY OF COOKERY.
215
Good living was unknown to the Romans, so long
as
they
were
engaged
in
fighting
for
independence
or
subduing
their
neigh- among the
boiu’s;
remaining
so
till
their
conquests
were extended to Africa, Sicily, and Greece.
They frequented Athens
for the study of polite
literature
and
philosophy,
and
with
refinement
of
manners
they
learned
the
pleasures
of
the
Grecian
banquets.
Thus
cooks
flocked to Rome,
as
well
as
orators,
philosophers,
rhetoricians,
and
poets.
When, by the progress of time and the universal
success of the arms of Rome, the wealth of the whole
world
was poiu'ed into her treasury,
the luxury of
the
table
was
incredibly
increased.
They
ate
of
everything, from the locust to the ostrich, from the
dormouse to the wild-boar.
All that could provoke
the
palate was
tried
as seasoning
or
relish, some
being substances of which we cannot imagine the use,
such as assafoetida, rue, and so forth.
Laying every
known
country under
contribution,
they
brought
guinea-fowls and
truffles from
Africa, rabbits from
Spain, pheasants from Greece, where they had been
imported from the banks of the Phasis, and peacocks
from the remotest countries of Asia.
A great
ambition among
the
wealthy Romans
was to have beautiful gardens, in which they culti-

vated not only the
fruits already known—such
as
pears,
apples,
figs, grapes—but
also
foreign
ones,
especially
the
apricot
from
Armenia,
the
peach
from Persia, the quince from Sidon, the strawberry
from the valleys of Mount Ida, and the cherry—the
conquest of Lucullus in Pontus.
Amongst comestibles, fish was an especial object
of luxury.
Those of distant countries were brought
in pots of honey.
Nor did the Komans bestow less care and atten-
tion
in the choice of their
wines, those of Greece,
Sicily, and Italy being especial favourites.
To give
the wine more
piquancy and
flavour, they some-
times infused flowers, scents, and various drugs into
it, and that to such an
extent, that some of their
recipes must have burned the mouth and violently
irritated the stomach.
It
w'as
in
the
accessories,
how^ever,
that
this
gigantic
luxury
was
shown
most
wildly.
The
number of courses gradually increased to twenty,
el-
even more.
For each
detail
of the
service, slaves
were specially appointed, w-ith their various duties
minutely
distinguished.

Sometimes
this
luxury
assumed
an

or
grotesque form.
Such were those banquets where
the
fish and birds
served were
counted by thou-

; or those
dishes whose

all was

was

upside down:
to

ful darkness.
At
the
appearance
of
those
barbarians,
the
alimentary art disappeared with the other sciences,
of which
it
is
the
companion
and
the
comfort.
Most
of the

Those savage mouths,
those
hot
throats, were
insensible
to
the
merits
of
refined
dishes.
Huge
quarters
of
beef and
venison,
un-
limited
supplies
of
the
strongest
drink,
were
all
they wanted
to make them
happy;
and
as they
always
wore
arms, nearly every
feast degenerated
into an orgie and was followed by bloodshed.
A
reaction
setting
in,
there were
gradual
im-
provements,
especially under
Charlemagne,
whose
capitularies
prove
that
he
personally
interested
himself in the management
of
his
table.
In the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries, banquets
assumed
a
gallant and chivalrous aspect
; the
ladies came to
embellish
the
court, and
distribute the rewards of
valour, and one might see placed on the tables of
princes
the
pheasant
with
gilded
claws and
the
peacock
with
expanded
tail, brought
in by
gold-
bespangled pages or gentle maidens, as innocent as
they were amiable.
Women, even those of highest station, took part
in the preparation of food, and thought such
cares
were included in the duties
of hospitality.
Under
their
fair hands some
of the dishes were strangely
disguised
: the
eel having a forked tongue
like a
serpent, the hare with the
ears of a
cat, and other
similar
comicalities.
They made much use of the

so much
so, that
fish was sometimes
cooked
in
rose-water.
In
short, from
the
care
bestowed by
the
ladies
of France upon the art of
cooking, we must conclude that to them is due the
indisjDutable pre-eminence which French gastronomy
has always enjoyed.
In
abbeys, convents, and other
religious houses,
there
was
never lack
of good
cheer,
because
the
wealth of these establishments was
less exposed to
the chances and dangers of our desolating civil wars.
In
the mean time, gastronomic
art was
slowly
extending.
The
Crusaders
presented
her
with
a
plant
plucked
from
the
plains
of
Ascalon—the
garlic
;
parsley was imported
from
Italy.
Pastry-
cooks made
such
advance
that
the
products
of
their industry
held an honourable
place
in every
feast
; and even before the time of Charles IX. they
formed a considerable corporation, for we find that
prince investing it with certain privileges.
About the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century,
coffee was introduced into Europe by the Dutch, who
had
first been taught to drink it by Soliman Aga, a
powerful Turk of
great repute amongst our great-
great-grandfathers.
In 1670
it was
sold
at
the
fair
of
Saint Germain by an
American;
and
the
first
Parisian
café was in Due St-André-des Arcs,

with mirrors and marble tables, exactly like those of
our own clays.
Then,
also, the age
of
sugar was beginning
to
dawn, and from Scarron complaining that his stingy
sister
had
got
the
holes
of
his
sugar-box made
smaller, we learn
at
least
that such a
thing was
commonly known in households.
It
was
during
the
same
period
that
brandy
began to be used, though
it was not drunk by the
people till the reign of Louis XV.
Under
the
brilliant
reign
of
Louis
XIV., the
science of banqueting received, in common
with the
other
sciences, great progressive
Magnifi-
impulse.
Men still retain some memory ot
those
festivals which
all Europe went to
see, and
those tournaments
where,
for the
last time, shone
the lances which
the bayonet has
so uncivilly
re-
placed, and those knightly
suits
of armour, feeble
resources against the brutality of the camion.
Tlie
festivals
ended
with
sumptuous
banquets
as
the crowning
part
of the
entertainment.
And
on
such
important
occasions were
first
displayed
the magnificence of huge
centre-pieces, which, by
the union of painting and sculpture with the
gold-
smith’s
art, formed a beautiful group, the
designs
being sometimes suited to the circumstances or the
hero of the festival.

2 24
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
Towards the end
of the
reign, the name of any
'
famous cook was very often written beside that of
his
j^atron,
the
latter,
in
fact,
being
generally
proud of the former.
This combination is unknown
in
these days; we
are
as
fond
of good
living
as
our ancestors, but interest ourselves much less about
him who reigns
in the lower regions, and probably
a nod is the only tribute
of admii-ation paid to the
artist who enchants us.
It was for Louis XIV. that the éfine
d'été—“ the
good pear,” as he
called it—was brought from the
Levant, and it is to his aged weakness that we owe the
“ liqueurs.”
For, feeling sometimes the difGculty of
living which often appears
after
sixty, they made
him a
cordial by mixing brandy with
sugar and
scents—the germ of the art of the modern liquoriste.
It should be remarked that about the same time
the
culinary
art
flourished
in the English
Court.
Queen Anne was fond of good cheer, and deigned to
consult her cook.

On
the
best
authority,
I
have been
told that among the
more special dishes were piques of superlative
deli-
cacy, matelotes
of the most tempting
q^uality, and
turkeys superbly stuffed.
The reign of Louis XV. was equally favourable
to the alimentary art.
The wealth created Keign of
by industry during eighteen years of peace, ^
and distributed by commerce, helped much to con-
ceal
the
inequality
of
fortunes,
and
a
spirit
of
conviviality
was
diffused
amongst
all
classes
of
society.
From this epoch we may date* the
obser-
vance of order, neatness, and
elegance, as
essentials
in a well-ordered meal.

‘ According to information which I have gathered in several

as follows
:
‘ First Course ;—Soup, followed by the houilli ; an entree of veal

; a side-dish.
‘ Second
Course :—A turkey
; a dish

portation
; and amongst others the cantaloup melon,
which,
in
spite
of the proverb, “Good melons are
rare
;
before you find one you’ll have to try
fifty,”
only produces good fruit.

is the
distinction
of good living from gluttony or guzzling.
It is now
looked upon as a bias or liking which one need not
be ashamed of, as a social quality agreeable to the
host,
useful
to
the
guest,
and
advantageous
to
science.
In
short, the gastronome
is
ranked with
the connoisseurs or lovers of the fine arts.*
* But for the reign of Louis XVIII. being so recent, our author
would probably have referred
to
his
qualities
as
a gastronome.
In these he as certainly equalled Louis the Magnificent and his
worthless
successor,
as
he
surpassed
them
intellectually and
morally.
His most famous maître d'hôtel was the Due d’Escars, of
whom a Quarterly Reviewer says that, when he and his royal master
were closeted together to meditate a dish, the Ministers of State
were kept waiting
in
the
antechamber,
and
the next day
the
official
announcement
regularly appeared—
‘ M.
le Duo d’Escars
a travaille dans le cabinet.’
The king had invented the
truffes à
la pur(fe
d’ortolans, and
invariably
prepared
it himself, assisted
by
the
duke.
On
one
occasion tliey had jointly composed a dish of more than ordinary
dimensions, and duly consumed the whole of
it.

One of the most recent creations
in the develop-
ment of gastronomy is the
political banquet.
It is
given with the object of bringing some influence
to
bear directly on a large number of wills, the main
requisite being abundance of good
cheer, although
it is generally lost upon the guests.
Positive enjoy-
ment, moreover, has but a very small share in such
an entertainment.
At last the restaurants appeared—an entirely new
institution
which
has
by no means
received
the
attention it merits, and must therefore be separately
treated.

that
on

if the guests were to discuss the price or quality of

On
his with-

list
is
a
sufficient
proof of the proposition advanced in
another part
of this work, that a Parisian dinner
is thoroughly
cosmopolitan, every country in the world furnishing
some of
its products.

GASTRONOMIC PRINCIPLES PUT INTO
PRACTICE.
M. DE Bokose lost his parents when young, and then
became
possessor
of an
income
of
forty thousand
francs.
Being carefully educated, he became, after
passing through the terrible times of the Revolution,
an authority
in matters of
taste,
especially
in
all
that concerns the love of good living.
M.
de
Borose
used
to
say that
gastronomy
is
nothing hut a combination of reflection, to appreciate,
with
science,
to
make
perfect.
And
he
quoted
Epicurus
:
“ Is man, then, made to
despise the gifts
of Nature ?
Does he only come into
this world to
gather
bitter fruits?
Eor whom
are
those flowers
which the gods cause to grow at the feet of mortals ?
It is a compliance with the will
of Providence
to
give way
to our
various natural
inclinations; our
duties come from
its
laws, our desires from
its
in-
spirations.”
He
used
to
say
also,
with Professor
Sebusien,
that
good
things
are
intended
for the
good; otherwise we should fall into the absurdity of
thinking that God has created them for the wicked.

taught M.
de
Borose
that
the number
of
dishes
being
pretty
well
determined by
custom,
a good
dinner is not much dearer than a bad one
; that for
less than £20 more a year a man need never drink
anything but the best wines; and that everything
depends on the will of the master, on
the order he
keeps in
his
household, and the tone and energy
which he imparts to the establishment generally.
Starting
from
these
fundamental
points,
the
dinners of Berose assumed a character and import-
ance quite classical.
Benown celebrated the enjoy-
ment of the guests, and men were proud of having
been invited
; some even praised the attractions of
his table who had never sat at it.
He never asked those
so-called gastronomes who
are mere gluttons, whose belly is an abyss, and who
eat
anywhere,
of
anything,
and
to
any
amount.
All his guests were men who, whilst devoting to the
business in hand
all the necessary time and atten-
tion,
never
forgot
that
there
is a moment when
reason says to appetite, Non procédés ampUus—not a
step further.
Twice a week he invited ladies, taking care so to
arrange matters that each of them should have the
exclusive
attention of a chivalrous
guest.
On the
first Monday of every month the parish clergyman
had his place at the
table, sui’e of being received

GASTRONOMIC PRINCIPLES.
237
with
respect and esteem
;
and he
is
said
to have
more than once expressed a wish that every month
had four first Mondays.
With
reference
to
tradesmen,
he
only
trusted
those who were honourable and just in their deal-
ings with
all, treating them as friends, and some-
times giving them assistance
or advice.
He made
the fortune of his wine-merchant, by giving out that
he was never guilty of adulteration—a virtue
rare
even at Athens in the times of Pericles, and by no
means common in the nineteenth century.
Those
details may be
forgiven
in
the
case
of
M. Berose, who did much to refine gastronomic taste
and
elevate
its
tone,
especially
on
reading
the
closing
scene
which
so
lately
saddened
all who
knew
him.
About
the middle of
last March he
was invited
to spend the day in the country with
several friends.
It was one
of those
unseasonably
warm
days, a forerunner of spring, and when they
were out walking the slcy suddenly became gloomy,
and a frightful storm burst forth with thunder, rain
and
hail.
Everybody ran
for
safety as they coiild
and
where they
could, and M. de Berose
sought
shelter under a poplar whose lower branches seemed
to offer some protection.
Ill-fated shelter
!
The tree’s lofty top rose to the
clouds as
if to find the

fluid, and the

falliug down the branches served
as
its conductor.
Suddenly
a
fearful
explosion was
heard, and
the
unfortunate pleasure-seeker fell dead without having
time to breathe a sigh.
XXX.
GASTEONOMIC MYTHOLOGY.
Gasterea
is the tenth Muse ; she presides over the
enjoyments of taste.
She might lay claim to the empire of the universe,
for the universe is nothing without life, and all that
has life requires nourishment.
She takes special pleasure in those rising grounds
where the vine flourishes, or those wLich the orange-
tree
perfumes,
in
the
thickets where
the
truffle
grows, in the countries which abound in game and
fruit.
^Yhen
she
deigns
to show
herself, she assumes
the form
of a young
girl, her zone
the colour of
fire, her
hair
black,
her eyes
azure-blue, and her
figure and movements
full
of
grace.
Fair as the
goddess
of
love,
she
is
above
all
sovereignly
beautiful.
Of
all
places
where
Gasterea
has
altars,
that

239
which she prefers
is the town, queen of the world,
which the Seine imprisons between the marbles of
his palaces.
The
worship
of
the
goddess
is
simple.
Every
day,
at
sunrise, her
priests
come
to
remove
the
crown
of flowers which adorns her
statue, placing
on
it a new
one, and singing in chorus one of the
many hymns by which
poetry
has
celebrated the
boons which
the immortal
sheds abundantly upon
the human race.
TEANSITIOK
Whoever has read me thus far Avith that attention
which
I have sought
to
excite and
sustain, must
have seen that in writing I had a double object in
view, never lost sight of.
The
first was to lay down
the fundamental theory of Gastronomy, so that she
should take her place amongst the sciences in that
rank to which she has an incontestable right.
The
second,
to
define
with
precision
what
must
be
understood by love of good
living,
so
that
for
all
time coming that social quality might be kept apart
from
gluttony and intemperance, with which many
have absurdly confounded
it.

240
aASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
The misleading double use of the term was intro-
duced
by
some
intolerant
moralists, who,
being
misled by an
unrestrained
zeal, were
ever seeing
excess where there was only well-regulated
enjoy-
ment;
for the
treasures
of
nature have not been
created
to
be
trod under
foot.
The blunder was
afterwards
propagated
by
some
unsocial
gram-
marians, who defined with their eyes shut, and swore
in verha magistri.
It is time such an error were put
a stop
to, now that the matter
is
clear
;
for at the
present day there
is nobody who has not a
slight
dash of the gastronome in his composition, and does
not plume
himself upon
it
; there
is nobody who
would not feel grossly insulted by being accused of
gluttony, voracity, or intemperance.
These
two
cardinal
points
having
been
fully
treated,
I might have
laid my pen
aside;
but in
fathoming
subjects which touch everything, many
things
have
come
into my
mind, such
as
some
original
anecdotes,
witticisms,
and
similar
side-
dishes, which could
not have been inserted in the
theoretical
part without breaking
the
continuity,
but will, I trust, yield the reader some pleasure as a
collection.
A little mixture of something relating to my own
personal
history
could
not
be avoided
;
but that
element
leaves
room
neither
for
discussion
nor

TRANSITION.
241
commentary.
My
principal
recompense
for
the
labour
of this work
is
to
find
myself thus
repro-
duced
in company
with my
friends.
It
is
more
especially when we are about to
lose
life that the
“I” and “me” become
dear
to
us;
and
if one
talks of himself he must mention his friends.

YAEIETIES.
THE CURÉ’S OMELETTE.
Everybody knows that for twenty years !Rradame II.*
has occupied the throne of beauty
in Paris unchal-
lenged.
It is also well-known that she is extremely
charitable, taking interest in most of those schemes
whose object is to console and assist the wretched.
Wishing to consult M. le Curé on something con-
nected with
that
subject, she
called upon him
at
five
o’clock
one afternoon, and was astonished
to
find him already
at
table.
She
thought every-
body in Paris dined
at
six, not knowing
that
the
ecclesiastics
generally
begin
early
because
they
take a light collation in the evening.
Madame
R. was
about
to
retire, but
the
cure
begged her to stay, either because the matter they
were to talk about need not prevent him dining, or
because a pretty woman is never a mar-fcast for any

lady has been
already

GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
man; or, perhaps, because he bethought himself that
somebody to talk to was all that was wanted to con-
vert his dining-room into a gastronomic Elysium,
The table was laid with a neat white
cloth, some
old wine sparkled in a
crystal decanter, the white
porcelain was
of
the
choicest
quality, the
plates
had
heaters
of
boiling water under them, and
a
servant, demure hut neat, was in attendance.
The repast was a happy mean between the frugal
and the
luxurious.
Some
fish soup had just been
removed, and there was now on the table a salmon-
trout, an omelette, and a salad,
“ My dinner shows you what perhaps you did not
know,”
said
the
pastor
with
a
smile,
“ that,
ac-
cording to the laws of the Church, meat is forbidden
to-day.”
The
visitor bowed her assent, hut at the
same
time,
as a private note informs me, slightly
blushed,
which, however, by
no
means prevented
the curé from eating.
Operations w'ere already begun upon the trout, its
uppej: side being fully disposed of ; the sauce gave
proof of a
skilful
hand, and the
pastor’s
features
betokened inward satisfaction.
That
dish
removed, he
attacked the
omelette,
which
was
round,
full-bellied,
and
cooked
to
a
nicety.
At the first stroke of the spoon there ran
out a thick juice, tempting both to sight and smell
;

THE cube's omelette.
245
the dish seemed full
of
it, and my dear cousin con-
fessed that her mouth watered.
Some signs
of natural sympathy did not escape
the curé, accustomed to watch the passions of men
;
and, as if in answer to a question which Madame E.
took great
care not
to
put, “ This
is a tunny ome-
lette,” said he.
“ My housekeeper has a wonderful
knack at them.
Nobody ever
tastes them without
complimenting me.”
“ I am not at all astonished,”
replied the lady visitor
;
“ for on our worldly tables
there is never seen an omelette half so tempting.”
This was followed by the salad—a finishing item
which
I
recommend
to
the
use
of
all who have
faith
in my teaching,
for
salad
refreshes without
fatiguing,
and
strengthens
without
irritating.
I
usually say it renews one’s youth.
The dinner did not interrupt their
conversation.
Besides the matter in hand, they spoke of the events
of the
time, the hopes
of the Church, and
other-
topics.
The dessert passed, consisting of some Sept-
moncel
cheese,
three
apples, and
some preserved
fruit
; and then the servant placed on a small table
a cup
of hot mocha, clear as amber, and filling the
room with its aroma.
Having sipped his coffee, the cure said grace.
“ I
never drink
spirits,” he
said as they rose
;
“ it is a
superfluity
I
offer
to my
guests,
but

reserve
as a resource
for old
age, should
it please
God that I live so long.”
In the mean time,
six
o’clock had
arrived, and
Madame
K., hurrying home, found herself late
for
dinner, and several friends waiting for her whom she
had invited for that day.
I was one of the party,
and thus came to hear of the cure’s omelette
;
for
our
hostess
did
nothing
hut
speak
of
it during
dinner, and everybody was
certain
it
must
have
been excellent.
Thus it is that, as a propagator of truths, I feel it
my duty to make known the preparation
; and I give
it the more willingly to all lovers of the art, that I
have not been able to find it in any cookery-book.

with
a

it up
till the
butter is melted.
That constitutes the speciality of
the omelette.
Then, in an oval dish, mix separately a lump of
butter with parsley and chives, and squeezing over
it the juice of a lemon, place
it over hot embers in
readiness.

stirring till all is well mixed
;
then, when properly
finished, and of the proper form and consistence,
spread it out skilfully on the oval dish which you
have ready to receive it, and serve up to be eaten at
once.
This
dish should be
reserved
for breakfasts
of
refinement, for connoisseurs in gastronomic a word of
art—those who
understand
eating,
and
where
all
eat with judgment
;
but, especially, let it
be washed down with some good old wine, and you
will see wonders.
EGGS IN GEAVY,
OxE day I was conducting two
ladies
to
Melun,
and on
reaching
Moutgeron,
after
several
hours’
travelling, we
felt
hungry
enough
to
eat
an
ox.
Alas
! the inn we stopped at, though looking decent
enough, had nothing but an empty
larder.
Three
stage-coaches and two post-chaises had been before
us,
and,
like the
Egyptian
locusts, had devoured
everything.
Looking into the kitchen, however, I saw turning
on the spit a leg of mutton, the very thing wanted.
The longing glances of the
ladies were in vain, for

it belonged
to three Englishmen who had brought
it, and were now patiently waiting, chatting over a
bottle of champagne.
“ But, surely,” said I, in a mixed tone of annoy-
ance and entreaty, “ you might fry us those eggs in
the gravy of this roast
: what with that and a cup
of
coffee
with
country
cream
to
it, we
shall be
resigned to our
fate.”
“ Certainly,” answered the
cook
;
“ the gravy I have a right
to dispose of, and
in two minutes you’ll have your dish.”
Whilst he was breaking the eggs I went to the
fireplace, and with my travelling knife made in the
forbidden gigot a dozen deep
wounds, letting
every
dro]3
of
the gravy run
out.
Then, watching the
preparation of the eggs, lest anything should
spoil
my plot, I
took possession of the dish and
carried
it to our room.
We of course made a capital meal,
laughing loudly every time we thought of ourselves
having the best part of the
roast, and our friends,
the English, chewing the remainder.
A NATIONAL VICTOBY.
During my
stay
in New York, I sometimes spent
an evening at Little’s Hotel, a sort of café-restaurant

forenoon, and
at
niglit
all
the usual American
re-
freshments.
My
usual
companions
there were
the Viscount
la Massue and Jean-Eodolphe Fehr, emigrants
like
myself.
We
treated
ourselves
to
a
welsh-rahbit,
washed down with
ale or cider, and spent the even-
ing quietly, talking
about our misfortunes, our en-
joyments, and our hopes.
I made the acquaintance there of a Mr. Wilkinson
(a Jamaica planter), and a friend of his, who accom-
panied him everywhere.
The
latter, whose name
I never heard, was one of the most singular men I
ever met
;
he had a square-shaped
face and quick
eyes,
seemed
to watch
everything
carefully,
but
never spoke, and his features showed as little change
as
those
of a blind man.
Only, when he heard a
merry joke
or something
humorous,
his
face
ex-
panded, and shutting his eyes and opening a mouth
as wide as the lower end of a trumpet, he gave vent
to a sort of horse-laugh.
As for Mr. Wilkinson, who
was
a man
of about
fifty, he had
all the manners
and bearing of a gentleman.
One evening, then, Mr. Wilkinson
invited
us
to
dine with him, and on my accepting for myself and
my two friends, the appointment was made for three
o’clock next day.
Just before leaving, however, the
waiter told me quietly that the planters had ordered

250
GASTRONOMY ^,S A FINE ART.
a good
dinner, with
special
directions
about
the
wine and
spirits, their
intention being
to
test our
drinking
powers,
for
the
big-mouthed man
had
said
that he was
sure he
could
himself
put
the
Frenchmen under the table.
Had a sense
of honour allowed, this news would
have made me back out of the engagement.
But
what would the English planters have said of such
apparent cowardice ?
Hence the maxim of Marshal
Saxe was
adopted;
“Since
the wine
is drawn
it
must be drunk.”
Next morning I sent for Fehr and La Massue to
give them
formal
w'arning, and
advised
them
to
drink
in small draughts, or even contrive cleverly
to get rid of their wine sometimes without drinking,
and above all to eat slowly and moderately.
More-
over, we shared between us a plate of bitter almonds,
which
I had
heard
praised
for
their
property
of
counteracting alcoholic fumes.
Thus armed, physically and morally, we kept our
appointment with
the
Jamaicans, and
soon
after,
dinner was
served.
It
consisted
of an enormous
joint of beef and a turkey, with vegetables, followed
by a salad and
a
tart.
We drank
in the French
fashion
; that is to say, the wine was served from the
commencement.
It was
good
claret,
then much
cheaper
there than
in
France, because

cargoes bad arrived that the market was too fully
stocked.
Mr. Wilkinson
did the
honours
of
the
table admirably
;
his friend seemed buried
in
his
plate, never saying a word, and sometimes looking
at us sideways, or laughing with the corners of his
mouth.
I
was
delighted
with my
two
acolytes.
La
Massue, in spite of his great digestive powers, spent
as much time
over
his meat as a finicking young
lady, and Fehr from time to time
cleverly smug-
gled his wine into a beer-pot which stood at the end
of the table.
After the
claret came
port, and
after the
port
madeira, to which we
stuck
for a long
time.
On
the arrival
of
the
dessert—consisting
of
a
pat
of
butter, cheese, and cocoa and hickory nuts—toasts
were drunk
to
the
health
of
kings, the
liberty of
peoples, and the beauty
of the
ladies—especially
Mr. Wilkinson’s daughter Maria, the
prettiest
girl,
as he assured us, in the whole island of Jamaica.
After the
wine came
the
spirits, namely,
rum,
brandy, and wliisky, and with the
spirits, songs.
I
saw we were
in
for
it, and
to
avoid
the
spirits,
I called for punch.
The landlord himself, no doubt
instructed
beforehand,
brought
in
a
bowl
large
enough
for
forty.
No
such
capacious
drinking
vessel
is ever seen in France.

252
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
Soon
after,
Mr.
Wilkinson
suddenly
started
to
his feet, and began to sing loudly the national air,
“ Rule
Britannia,” but could never get over those
two words
;
his strength
failed him
; he let himself
fall back on his chair, and thence rolled under the
table.
His
friend,
seeing
him
in
such
a
case,
grinned one of his loudest horse-laughs, and, stoop-
ing down to assist him, fell by his side.
This unexpected dénoûment gave me inexpressible
relief.
Ringing for the landlord, I asked him “to
see
that
the
gentlemen
were
properly
attended
to,” as the phrase was, and we drank with him to
their health in a parting glass of the punch.
Mean-
time, the
waiter, with assistants, had taken posses-
sion
of
the vanquished, and were
carrying
them
home,
feet
foremost,
according
to
the
English
formula.
The
friend preserved the same absolute
immobility, and Mr. Wilkinson was
still trying to
sing “ Rule Britannia.”
Next day, seeing an account of our dinner in the
New York
papers,
with
the remark
that
the
two
Englishmen were
ill, I went
to pay them a
visit.
The friend I found stupefied with a severe attack of
indigestion, and Mr. Wilkinson confined to his chair
by an attack of gout.
He seemed pleased with my
visit, one of his remai’ks being, “ My dear
sir, you
are
very
good
company
indeed,
but
too
hard a
drinker for us.”

DEFEAT OF A GENEEAL.
The
other
clay
I saw an instance of the extrême
imperturbability
of
members
of
the
College
of
Apothecaries.
Paying a visit to my friend, General
Bouvier, I
found him walking up and down
his room with a
look of annoyance.
“ Here,” said
he, handing me a piece
of paper,
“give me your opinion of this; you are a judge of
those matters.”
I took the paper, and was astonished
to see that
it was an account of charges for medicines.
“ Faith
! ” said I, “ you know the custom
of that
body whose services you have engaged.
It
is very
possible
that
the
limits have been exceeded
; but
why do you wear an embroidered coat, three
orders,
and a laced hat ? ”
“ Hold your tongue,” said he impatiently
;
“ this
charge is abominable.
But you’ll see my
‘ scorcher
’
presently,
for
I
have
sent
for
him,
and
he
is
coming.”
As he spoke the door opened, and we saw a man
of about fifty-five, carefully
dressed, of tall stature,
and composed demeanour.
“ Sir,” said the general to him, “ the bill you have
sent me is a regular physician’s account.”

sir, that your drugs

G.

The B. M.
Sir, I sell medicine.
There
the
discussion
ended.
The
general,
ashamed of having committed
so many
solecisms,
and of
being so backward
in a knowledge
of the
pharmaceutical
language,
lost
his
self-possession,
forgot what he had
to say, and paid whatever they
wished.
THE GASTRONOME ABROAD.
In a preceding chapter I have shown
the immense
advantages which France gained from good living
during the events of 1815.
Similarly, the emigrants
reaped great profit from the universal propensity.
While passing through Boston, I taught Julien,

the
hotel-keeper,
to make
a fondue,
such
as
I
have described elsewhere.
This
dish, a novelty to
the Americans, became so much the rage, that when
I was in New York, he felt himself obliged, by way
of
thanks,
to send me the rump of one
of
those
beautiful
little
roe-bucks brought
in
winter from
Canada, and
it was found exquisite by the chosen
committee whom I convoked for the occasion.
Collet, also, a French captain, made a small for-
tune in New York about the same time, by making
ices and sherbets.
The women, in particular, never
tired
of
this new
pleasure,
being
especially
as-
tonished
that
they
could
be
kept
so
cold
at
a
summer-heat of ninety degrees.
Whilst
staying
at Cologne,
I met a gentleman
from
Brittany who had done
very
well when
in
exile by keeping a dining-house.
I could multiply such examples indefinitely, but
I
prefer
to
tell
the
story
of
a
Frenchman,
of
Limousin, who made
his fortune
in London by his
skill in mixing a salad.
Although
his means were
very
limited,
Albignac
(so
he
was
called,
if
I
remember aright) went one day
to dine
in one
of
the most famous
taverns
in
London,
Whilst
he
was
finishing
his
succulent
beef-steak, there were
five or six young dandies of
good family regaling
themselves at a neighbouring table.
One of them

came to him, and said very politely,
“ Sir, it is said
that your nation excels in the art of making salads
;
will you be so good as oblige us by mixing one ? ”
D’Albignac
consenting,
after a
little
hesitation,
ordered
all that he thought necessary
for the
ex-
pected masterpiece, used
his
best endeavours, and
had the good luck to succeed.
Whilst
studying
the
ingredients,
he
answered
frankly
all questions about himself.
He said
he
was an emigrant, and admitted, not without some
natural shame, that he was receiving assistance fi-om
the English Government—a circumstance which no
doubt authorized one of the young men to slij3 into
the exile’s hand a five-pound note, and
insist on
his
keeping it.
He had given his address, and some time after, he
received a very civil note, requesting him to go and
mix a salad in one of the finest houses in Grosvendr
Square.
D’Albignac arrived punctually, after fur-
nishing himself
with some
special seasonings and
maturing his plans.
He had the good luck
to suc-
ceed again.
The first party for whom he had manipulated had
exaggerated the merits of his salad, and the second
company made
so much more noise about
it,
tliat
d’Albignac’s reputation was already made.
He was
known as the fashionable salad-maker, and soon had

a gig, in order to keep his appointments, with a ser-
vant to bring in
his mahogany-case, containing
all
the
ingredients—such
as
vinegars
of
different
flavours,
oils with
or without
a
fruity
taste,
soy,
caviare,
truffles,
anchovies,
ketchups,
gravies, and
even hard-boiled eggs.
Later, he got cases made to order, furnished them
completely, and sold them by hundreds.
In short,
having diligently
carried out
his plans with sense
and discretion, he came to realize a fortune of more
than eighty thousand
francs
; and returning to
his
own country when
peace was
restored, he
invested
sixty thousand in the public funds—then selling at
fifty per
cent.—and the
rest
in
a small
estate
in
Limousin,
his
native
country.
And
for aught
I
know, he
still
lives
there, contented
and
happy,
because he has the wisdom to limit his desires.

He
was
good
enough to pay me particular

me
to accompany him

but, hurried along by the
course of circumstances then disturbing Europe, I

there a

So well

I
prayed
for was
that
I
should
not
have
less
happiness
in
the
Old World
than
I
had
had
in
the
New.
This
success
I
mainly
attribute
to
the
fact
that,
on
arriving amongst the Americans,
I spoke
as they
did,* dressed
as they did, and took great care not
to
show more knowledge of the world
than
they
did.
It was when thus peacefully quitting a country

where I had been on friendly terms with everybody,
and when
in
all
creation there was not a
story of
featherless biped more
full of love
for his
^ battle,
fellow-creatnres,
that
an
incident
occurred which
was within an ace of involving me in a dire tragedy.
It was
on
the steamboat
at New York.
There
were
several Frenchmen
on
board,
including
M.
Gauthier, a man
v^ell known
in
Paris
; and having
been much delayed
at a
critical time of the tide,
they showed considerable impatience on finding that
the only reason was that two American passengers
had not yet come on board.
I at
first paid
little
attention to their grumbling, for I felt in low spirits,
and was
thinking
of
the
lot
in
store
for me
in
France, when all
at once a startling uproar broke
forth, and I saw that it was caused by Gauthier, who
had given an American a box on the ear sufficient
to have knocked down a rhinoceros.
The confusion was frightful. The words “ French,”
“American,” were
bandied
about
till the
quarrel
became a national
one,
and
it was
seriously
pro-
posed that the whole of the Frenchmen should be
thrown
overboard.
Being the
likeliest,
from my
build and
height,
to make
resistance,
the
most
prominent hostile Yankee came
to me
in
warlike
attitude.
He was
as
high
as a church-tower, and
stout

proportion
;
but

taking

with
steadfast and
keen
look,
I saw
that he was
of a lymphatic temperament, with a bloated
face,
dull eyes, small head, and a woman’s legs.
“ Do you think you can bully me ?” I shouted,
swearing at him
in the strongest terms of English
invective.
“ I’ll throw you overboard like a dead cat.
If I find you too heavy. I’ll cling to you with hands,
legs,
teeth,
nails, everything
;
and
if
I
cannot do
better, we’ll go together
to the bottom
; my
life is
nothing to send such a dog to hell
!
Come on
! ”
Of course, my figure, action, and
attitude showed
the
truth
of my words
(for
I
felt
as strong
as
a
Hercules).
l\Iy man
seemed
to
lose
an
inch
in
height, his arms
fell, and
his face became
longer.
In short, he showed such evident marks of fear that
one
of his countrymen came
to
interpose.
It was
well he did so, for I was then an active fellow, and
the inhabitant of the New World was pretty certain
to feel that those who bathe
in the Furens * have
tough sinews and well-knit frames.
Meantime, words of peace were already heard on
another
part
of
the deck, the
arrival -of the two
unpunctual
Americans
diverted
the
attention
of
some, and already the ship was getting under way.

A BUNCH OF ASPARAGUS.

A few minutes
after, I went to look tor Gauthier,
in order to scold him
for his
hot-headedness, and
found him sitting at the same
table with the man
he had slapped, in presence of a most
attractive-
looking ham, and a jug of heer about half a yard
high.
A BUNCH OF ASPAKAGÜS.
On my way
to
the Palais-Eoyal, one
fine day
in
February,
I
halted
before
the
shop
of Madame
Chevet, with whom I am rather a favourite, to look
at a bunch of asparagus, the smallest stick of which
was thicker than my
forefinger.
Forty francs was
the price of it.
“ They are certainly very fine ones,”
said I, “ but, at that
price, scarcely any one except
a king or prince could eat them.”
“You are mistaken,” replied she; “such choice
ones as those never enter
palaces, where they wish
for what
is
fine and not what
is magnificent.
For
all
that, my bunch of asparagus will not stay long
on hand. Why, at this very moment,” she continued,
“there
are
at
least
three
hundred wealthy men,
financiers, capitalists, wholesale merchants, and so on,
who must

gout,

which don’t prevent them from
eating.
They
sit
by the fire, puzzling their brains to know what will
please their palate, and at
last they send a footman
on a voyage
of discovery.
He comes
to my shop,
notices
the
asparagus, makes
his
report, and
the
bunch
is
carried
off at any
price.
Or perhaps a
pretty young woman
is passing with her lover, and
says,
‘ Just
look,
dear, at the beautiful asparagus
;
let us buy the bundle—you know how well my maid
makes the
sauce.’
Or, again, there is a wager, or a
christening-dinner, or a sudden
rise
in
stocks, or a
hundred other things.”
As she was
talking, two
big
Englishmen
who
were
passing,
arm-in-arm,
stopped
near
us,
their
faces
expressing
their
admiration.
One
of them
told her to wrap up the wonderful bunch, without
even asking
the
price
;
then,
after paying, put
it
under
his arm and
carried
it
off, whistling
“ God
save the King.”

;

This
dish

origin.
It
is
a
healthy,
saYouiy, and
ajipetizing
dish, quickly dressed, and
always convenient to place before unexpected guests.
It
has,
besides, received honourable mention
in a
previous
chapter, and
I now proceed
to
give
the
official recipe.
Take
ffi’st as many eggs as there are
guests, and
then about a third as much by weight of the best
Gruyères
cheese, and the
half
of
that
of
butter.
Break and beat up the eggs well in a saucepan, then
add the butter and the cheese, grated or cut in small
pieces
; place the saucepan on the fire, and stir with
a wooden spoon
till
it
is of a
thick and
soft
con-
sistence
;
put
in
salt according
to the age of the
cheese, and a strong dose of
pepper—that being a
special
attribute of this ancient dish.
Finally, let
it be brought to table on
a hot
dish,
and, if some
of your
best wine
is brought and the bottle passes
briskly, you will see wonders.

THE CHEVALIERS AND ABBÉS.
I HAVE
already
twice
referred to these two gas-
tronomic
categories, now no more
existing.
They
will probably again appear towards the end of this
present century, hut such a phenomenon will require
the
coincidence
of
many
future
contingencies.
Therefore, since they have disappeared more than
thirty years,
I, as a painter of manners, give them
another touch of my brush.
The main
qualifications
latterly
for a chevalier
were education and a good figure.
Most
of them
were handsome fellows, and only too ready to draw
their swords.
Some would
call you out if you only
looked at them.
One
of
the most famous
in my time
was
the
Chevalier de
S.
He sought a quarrel with a young
man who had just arrived from
Charolles, and they
went to fight on the marshy ground which then lay
behind the houses of the Chaussée d’Antin.
From
the
action
and
attitude
of
the
young
stranger,
S. soon saw
that he had
to do
with no
novice
;
that, however, did not make him
hesitate
about resolving to try his mettle.
But at the
first
movement
he
made, the
Charollian gave

expected lunge, so well delivered that the chevalier
was dead before he had time to
fall.
One of his
friends, who
had
been
looking
on,
carefully and
silently examined the wound of such startling effect,
and the direction which the sword had taken.
“ A
mo5t
artistic thrust,”
said he, as he turned to go
;
“that young
fellow
is a master of fence.”
It was
all the funeral oration the dead man got.
Beside their common love for good
living, there
was this in common with the two categories,

assumed the title on coming to Paris.
The title of
abbé was very convenient—with a slight modification
of the dress one seemed quite professional
; then he
could mix with all ranks in society
; he was invited
everywhere, petted, sought after
; and there was no
family without their abbé.
Chevaliers
will
be found
again,
if,
as we
trust,
peace
is
long
continued;
but
unless
there
be
a
mighty change
in the
ecclesiastical administration,
the race of abbés
is irretrievably lost.

MISCELLANEA.
“ My Lord Councillor,”
said a dowager marchioness
one day, from the head of her table,
“ which do you
prefer. Burgundy or Bordeaux ? ”
“ That, my lady,”
answered the magistrate in an oracular tone,
“ is a
trial
in which
there
is
so much
pleasure
in
the
examination of both sides, that I always adjourn for
a week the pronouncing of the verdict.”
It
is people of sense and culture, especially, who
hold the love of good living in honour.
Other men
are incapable of an operation
consisting in a series
of appreciations and judgments.
The Countess de
Genlis
boasts, in her memoirs, of having taught a

lady, who
had

M. de

late
President
of
the
Court
of
Cassation, a man whose wit and gaiety have braved
the snows of age, once said, in 1812, to three of the
most distinguished men
of science
of that
period
(Laplace, Chaptal and Berthollet),
“ I consider the
discovery of a new dish
as
a
far more interesting
event
than
the
discovery
of
a
star;
for
dishes

of

Count M., speaking of a political candidate who had

When in my twenty-sixth year, a troop of amateur
musicians.
Of whom
I
was

started at
one
o’clock on a
fine summer’s morning
to
go
to
St.
Sulpice, an
abbey
placed
on
one
of
the
highest
mountains in my native parish.
It was the day of
St. Bernard, the patron saint, and we were to assist
in the
choir, and, as the abbot said in giving the
invitation,
have
the
honom’
of
being
the
first
Orpheuses to penetrate into those lofty regions.

monumental
nose.
“ Welcome,
gentlemen,”
said
tlie good father; “our venerable abbot
is
still
in
bed, but if you come with me you will see that you
were expected.”
In the refectory we saw something to delight us.
In the centre of a spacious table rose a pasty large
as a church, flanked on the north by a quarter of
cold veal, on the south by an enormous ham, on the
east by a pyramid of butter, and on the west by a
huge
supply
of
artichokes
done
with
hot
sauce.
We
saw,
besides,
fruits
of
different
kinds,
plates,
knives, silver
spoons and forks, and at the end
of
the
table
the
lay-brothers and
servants, ready
to
wait upon
us, astonished to
find themselves up
so
early.
In one corner
of the
refectory was
seen a
pile
of more
than
a
hundred
bottles,
constantly
watered by
a
natural
fountain.
If
the
aroma
of
mocha did not please our nostrils, it was because, in
those heroic times, coffee was not yet taken so eai-ly.
In
church, we
performed
a
symphony
at
the
offertory and an anthem at the elevation, finishing
with
a
quartet
of
wind
instruments.
And,
in
spite
of the
sneers
cast upon amateur music, truth
obliges me
to
say
that we got through
it
pretty
well.
After receiving much praise from the fathers and
thanks from the abbot, we
sat down to dinner.

was
served
in the
style
of
the
fifteenth century
:
few
side
dishes, few
nicknacks,
but
an
excellent
choice
of
meat, wholesome
stews,
and, above
all,
vegetables
of
a
fiavour
unknown
in
the
lower
regions.
We wished for nothing.
There was
no
lack
of
liqueurs, but
the
coffee
especially
deserves
mention.
It
was
wonderfully
clear, well-flavoured, and hot
;
but, more than
that,
it was not handed round in those diminished vessels
termed
“ cups ” on the banks
of the
Seine, but in
handsome and capacious bowls, into which the thick
lips of the good fathers plunged at pleasure, absorb-
ing the refreshing beverage with peculiar sounds of
enjoyment.
After vespers, during which we executed between
the
psalms
some
music
I
had
composed
for the
occasion, w'e went to enjoy the mountain
air, which
not
only
cheers
the
spirits,
but
stimulates
the
imagination.
By the time we
entered again,
it was
late, and
the abbot having
said good-night
to all, we began
to
spend
an
evening
of
considerable
gaiety,
the
fathers being
then
allowed
fuller
liberty.
Every
day
is not St. Bernard’s, as the abbot said.
About nine o’clock supper was served

some
one
called
aloud,
“ Fatlier
cellarer,
what’s
come
of your dish ? ”
“ You
are
perfectly right,”
replied
the
good
brother;
“I’m
not
cellarer
for
nothing.”
Leaving the room, he
quickly came back with
three attendants, one carrying a quantity of buttered
toast, and the other two loaded with a table bearing
a bowl of biu-niug brandy—in fact, a sort of punch.
This
arrival
was
received
with
acclamation, and
ample justice done
to
it
; and
as the abbey clock
sounded midnight, each of us retired to his room to
enjoy that sweet sleep to which the toils of the day
inclined and entitled him.
THE GASTEÜNOME IN LUCK.
One day, mounted on my good horse Joy,
I was
crossing the smiling
slopes
of the Jura.
It was in
the worst days of the Kevolution, and I was on my
way to Dole, to see the representative Prot, and get
from him a
safe-conduct which might prevent me
from going
to
prison, and thence, probably, to the
guillotine.
Halting
at an
inn in the
village of
Mont-sous-
Vaudrey, I looked into the kitchen, after seeing to

my nag’s comforts, and foimd sometliing
to delight
the eyes of a traveller.
A spit was turning before a
glowing
fire, admirably furnished with
quails, royal
quails;
and
close
by, I saw ready cooked one
of
those plump leverets, unknown
to men in town, the
perfume of which would
fill a church.
“ Good
! ”
said I to myself, cheered at the sight ;
“ I am not entirely abandoned by
Providence.
A
traveller may gather a flower by the wayside
; time
enough afterwards to talk of dying.”
To my grievous disappointment I found that what
I saw was
for some gentlemen of the law who had
been engaged near the village as legal experts.
For
me there was nothing but potato soup, and the beef
which had been boiled in
it, with some shoulder of
mutton and
haricots.
That tempting
bill
of fare
which I had fondly imagined to myself only made
me feel more desolate, and I was again overwhelmed
with my misfortunes.
I soon, however, regained
coiu’age, for on sending
a message to them, the gentlemen said they would
be delighted to have me
at the same table.
And
what a dinner we made
!
I remember particularly
a
chicken
fricassée,
richly
dowered
with
truffles,
sufficient to have renewed the youth
of Tithonus.
The dessert consisted of vanilla cream, some choice
cheese, and fruit
; and we moistened the whole, first

with,
a light
pink-coloured wine, then with
some
hermitage, and afterwards with some
soft and gene-
rous wine of a straw-colour.
The excellence of the dinner was surpassed by its
gaiety.
After the events of
those days had been
discussed, not without some circumspection, we got
as intimate as boon-companions.
Stories were told
and songs were sung; and, strange enough, I actually
composed an impromptu for the occasion, which was,
of course, immensely applauded.
Here it is
:

his
steps, could
thus
amuse himself, must have had the head and heart

least, hut I
at
last convinced them
that my journey was by no means one of pleasure.

into
their hands,
I would have them believe that
after more than thirty years I now write these words
with the most lively feelings of gratitude.
-
On reaching Dole, I was by no means favourably
received by M, Prôt.
He seemed to regard me with
suspicion, and I was glad
to get
off without being
arrested.
He was not exactly a bad man, but being
of small capacity, he did know how to employ the
formidable power put
in
his hands—he was
like a
child armed with the club of Hercules.
M. Amondru, however, whose name I have great
pleasure in mentioning, succeeded, though with con-
siderable
difficulty,
in
getting
him
to
accept
an
invitation to supper.
Madame Prot also came
;
and,
on paying my
respects to
her, I
soon found
(oh,
happiness unlooked for !) that she was passionately
fond of music; and
in an
instant,
as
it were, our
hearts beat in unison.
She spoke
to me of books
on musical composition—I knew them all; she spoke
to me of the most fashionable operas—I had them
by heart
;
she named the
most famous
singers
I had
seen
nearly
all
of
them.
She
could have
talked
for
ever,
not
having
for
a long time met
any one with whom she could discuss her favourite
study.
After supper she sent for some of her music-books.
She sang, I sang, we sang.

into my
music, never had more enjoyment
in
it.
M. Prêt had already several times spoken of going-,
but she
paid no
heed,
till
at
last we finished
in
grand style by singing the duet,
“ Vous souvient-il
de cette
fête ? ” in “ La Fausse Magie.”
Now was the moment of parting.
“ Citizen,” said
Madame
Prêt
to me, “ no one who has

as
you
have
done
can
betray
his
country.
I know your object
is to get something
from my

You

On this speech, so consoling
to me, I kissed her
hand with a full
heart.
Next morning
I received
my
safe-conduct,
duly
signed
and
magnificently
sealed, and thus was accomplished the object of mv

rOETRY.
No verse, you know, Mæcenas, can live long
Writ by a water-drinker.
Since the day
When Bacchus took us poets into pay
With fauns and satyrs, the celestial Nine
Have smelt each morning of last evening’s wine.
The praises heaped by Homer on the bowl
At once convict him as a thirsty soul
;
And father Ennius ne’er could be provoked
To sing of battles till his lips were soaked.
“ Let temperate folk write verses in the hall
Where bonds change hands, abstainers not at all
; ”
£o ran my edict: now the clan drinks hard,
And vinous breath distinguishes a bard.
Conington’s Horace.
Did time allow, I should have extracted and classi-
fied
all
the poetry
of
epicures, from
the days
of
the
ancient Greeks and Romans to
our own
time,
arranging
it
historically,
to
show how speech
or
literature
as
a
fine
art
is
intimately
aRied
to
gastronomy.
The following air is by Motin, said to be the first
in France
to write drinking
songs.
It smacks
of
the
good
old
six-bottle times, and does
not lack
poetic ardour
PRAISE OF AVINE.
A tavern is the home for me
!
There 1 live jollily and free,
And wish no better place.

276
OASTRONOMT AS A FINE ART.
Each want supplied, I live in state :
The erochery seems of silver plate
I
The napkins finest lace
!
AVhen summer’s sun is glowing hot,
Mine inn’s a pleasant, sheltered spot,
There is not such another.
In winter, nothing I desire
When cosy by it^ parlour fire.
Though bleak and keen the weather.
Our patron Bacehus we extol.
Whose noble gift inspires the soul
;
Man’s greatest boon is wine
!
Let no good-hearted fellows shrink.
For they become, whene’er they drink.
Like angels, all divine
I
The wine upon me smiles, and I
Fondly caress it in reply
:
(Dull care—I then defy it !)
Our love is mutual and strong
;
So when I take it, then, ere long,
I’m overtaken hy it
1
My hearty prayer, till I be dead.
Is that the white wine and the red
Within me find good lodgment.
But if they show a fighting mood.
And cannot live as brothers should.
Expulsion is my judgment
!
The next is by the professor himself, who has also
set it to music.
He shrinks, however, from having
his
compositions
published,
notwithstanding
the
pleasure
he should have
in seeing himself on
all
pianos.
By a happy coincidence, it can also be sung
to tlie air of “Vaudeville du Figaro.”

POETRY.
WHAT THE WISE PURSUE.
The smiles of Glory we despise
;
Her promises have lured us long
;
And History, compact of
lies,
A tangled web of crime and wrong.
Drinking’s the study for the wise
!
Then drink this wine which brightly glances
Our sires extolled it—age enhances
1
Astronomy I’ye thrown aside
;
Among the stars I lost my way.
And Chemistry too long I tried.
It cost me more than I could pay.
Gastronomy is now my pride;
Its studies all my time employ :
Good Living gives us genuine joy
I
When young I read both morn and even,
Which soon grey hair and wrinkles brought
;
And all the Grecian sages seven.
Of sense or wisdom nothing taught ;
To Idlesse now my hours are given
:
Lounging is your true employment
To yield philosophers enjoyment.
Medicine once, both night and day,
I studied with devoted faith
;
But Medicine still, do what she may,
Can only smooth the way to death.
’Tis Cookery now on which I lay
My fondest hopes
:
its powers divines t
Have proved it Art of arts the Finest
1
But all such mental work must tire.
And therefore, at the close of day,
To cheer my studies, and inspire
Fresh gaiety, I homage pay
To Love and Beauty—spite tlio ire
Of prudes and bigots
; merry Cupid
1
Delight of
all that are not stupid
1

278
GASTRONOMY AS A FINE ART.
As a finale, I give some verses belonging
to the
chapter on “ Death.”
I have
tried to
set them to
music, but
have
not
succeeded
to my mind, and
therefore bequeath that task to another.
LAST SCENE OF ALL.
Through all my frame life ebbs apace
;
Sight dims
; I’m chill iu every part.
My wife, with sad and tear-stained face,
Lays trembling hand upon my heart.
Already friends and kindred dear
Have called to bid the last good-bye;
The doctor’s left; our pastor’s here;
And now I die.
I wish to pray, but thought is gone
;
To speak, but lips can form no sound;
I hear a faint and ringing tone
;
And something seems to hover round.
All now is dark.
My weary breast
Exhausts itself to heave a sigh,
Scarce by these icy lips expressed
;
Ah
I now I die.
HISTORICAL ELEGY.
You,
the
first
parents
of
the
human
race,
who
ruined
yourselves
for
an
apple, what would
you
have done
for a turkey done with
truffles? but
in
Eden there were neither cooks nor confectioners.—
How
I pity you
!

niSTOEICAL ELEGY.
279
Ye mighty kings who brought haughty Troy to
ruins, your prowess will be handed down from age
to age, but your
table was scanty.
With nothing
but a joint of beef or a chine of pork, you knew not
the
charms
of
a
matelote,
or
the
delights
of
a
chicken /n'cassee.—How I pity you!
You, Aspasia, Chloë, and others whose forms the
Grecian
chisel
has immortalized
to the despair of
modern
belles,
never
did your
charming
mouths
inhale the
sweetness
of a scented meringue; your
ideas scarcely rose above gingerbread.—How I pity
you!
You,
gentle
priestesses
of
Vesta,
burdened
at
once with
so many honours and with the dread of
such dreadful punishments, if only you had tasted
those delightful
syrups,
preserved
fruits,
and
ice
creams
of various flavour, the marvels of our age
!
—How I pity you
!
You, invincible
Paladins, renowned by
the min-
strels,
never—after vanquishing
giants,
delivering
fair
ladies,
or
exterminating
armies—never did a
black-eyed captive offer you the foaming champagne
or a goblet of Madeira
: you had
to content your-
selves with ale and some poor, herb-flavoured wine.
—How I pity you
!
You, abbots and bishops, wlio dispensed the favours
of
heaven,
and
you,
the
dreaded
Templars, who

28o
gastronomy as a fine art.
anned
yourselves
for
the
extermination
of
the
Saracens, you knew nothing
of the sweet, restoring
influence
of
our
modern
chocolate,
nor
of
the
thought-inspiring
bean
of
Arabia.—How
I
pity
you!
You,
too, gastronomes
of
the present
day, who
dream of some new dish to flatter your palled appe-
tites, even you I pity, because you cannot enjoy the
discoveries which
science has
in
store
for the year
1900 , such as contributions drawn from the mineral
kingdom, and liqueurs produced by the pressure of
a hundred atmospheres
; nor
will you ever see the
importations to be brought by voyagers yet unborn,
from distant lands still unknown or unexplored
!

WINDUS’S
Hist
of Boofts.

ON BOOKS AND BOOK-BUYERS.
BY JOHN RUSKIN.
‘ ‘ / say we have despised literature ; what do we, as a nation, care
about
books ?
How much
do you
think we
spettd altogether on our
libraries, public
or private, as compared with what we spend on our
horses?
If a man spends lavishly on
his
library, you call him mad
—a bibliomaniac.
But you never call one a horse-maniac, though men
ruin themselves every day by their horses, and you do not hear (f people
ruining themselves by
their
books.
Or,
to go lower
still, how 7jiuch do
you think the contoits of the bookshelves of the United Kingdom, public
and private, would fetch,
as compared with
the contents of its wine-
cellars ?
ifhat position would its expendihire on lite^-ature take as com-
pared with its expenditure on luxurious eating?
We talk offoodfor
the mind, as offood for the body : now, a good book contains such food
inexhaustible :
it is provision for
life, and for the best part of us ; yet
how long most people would look at the best book
before they would give
the price of a large turbot for
it!
Though
there have been men who
have pinched their stomachs and bared their backs to buy a book, whose
libraries zvere cheaper
to them, I think, in
the end, than most
men's
dinners are.
We arefew of us put
to such a trial, and more thepity ;
for, indeed, a precious thing is all the more precious to us if it has been
won by work or economy ; and if public
libraries were half as costly as
public dinners, or books
cost the tenth part of what bracelets do, even
foolish men and women might sometimes suspect there was good in read-
ing as well as hi munching and sparkling ; whereas the veiy cheapness
of literature is making
even
wiser people forget that if a book is worth
reading
it
is worth
buying."

The book ^ives one the idea
that the author had an acute and independent mind; and that, had he lived, he
might have done something in criticism and fiction.
His indication, at such a

“ Hitherto Thomas Moore has been mostly regarded as one of the lighter writers

Prince of Argolis, The:
A
Story
of
the Old Greek Fairy Time.
By J. Moyr Smith.
With 130 Illustrations by the Author.
“ /«
' The Prince of Argolis* Mr. Moyr Smith has given us a very lively version
of the grafui old Greek jnyth of Theseus*
He has skilfully contrived to preserve
the rich classicflavour and grace ofthe story ^ while at the sa7ue time infusing into
it a spirit of sparkle and badinage which is essentially modern*
In doing this
Mr. Smith has been materially helped by the channing little woodcuts which he
has scattered all through the volume., andwhich contmually peep uf> in ufiexpected
corfters to give additional point a?td humour to the text.
His treatment of the
Greek heroic inyth is widely differentfrom Kingsley's—not, perhaps ^ so revereiit or
so loftily astheticy but quite as wise y and much more wittyP—Scotsman,

Proctor’s Pleasant Ways in Science.
By Richard A. Proctor.
“ When scientificproblems ofan abstruse and difficult character are presented
to the unscientific mind, something more than mere knowledge
is
tiecessary hi
order to achieve success.
The ability
to trace such problems through the several
stages of observation and experiment
to
their successful solution, without once
sttffering the reader's attention to flag, or his interest in the issue of the investi-
gation to abate, argues
the possession by the writer,
not only of a thorough ac-
quaintance with his subject, but also of that rare gift, the power of readily im-
parting his knoiuledge to those who have not the aptitude to acquire ii, undivested
of scientific formulte.
Now, such a writer is Mr. R. A. Proctor.
Of his skill in
this particular class of literature he has already given ample proof in such works
as his ‘Light Science for Leisure Hours,' ‘Science Byways,’ &-V. ; and his present
suork, ‘Pleasant Ways in Science j follows closely on the same track."

The' Battle of the Books

the similar combat in

Three Vols., crown 8vo, at every Library.
Under One Roof.
By James Payn, Author of “By Proxy,” &c.
" The title of this novel
is more than usually happy and significant
.
.
.
The author deserves thanks for his charming sketch of the German governess, for
his portraits of the two natural, graceful English girls, of whom one at
least
displays the wisdom of the serpent in piquant cosijunction with the harmlessness of
the dove, and for the scenes in which
these three girls are wooed and eventually
won.
With a few delicate attd happy touches, and a dash of humour to colour the
picture, he presents us with many an exhilarating piece of love-making which we
at once acknosuledge to be hit off to the life, and of which we can easily fill up the
mere outline eitherfrom the imagination or, peradventure, from snemory.
.
.
.
The irrepressible spirit of drollery prevails ; and his intermixture of the sublime
and the ridiculous goes to confirm the truth of the saying that comedy lurks in the
chinks of tragedy ....
The story is pretty sure to be found attractive ."
