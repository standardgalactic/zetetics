rephotographed; in other situations, new specimens were used that 
clearly reﬂected the orientation and view of the original black/white 
image. Also, a couple of new images are introduced. A special effort was 
made to present color images of the best quality as reasonably possible. 
Generally speaking, these color images follow the same sequence, are of 
the same views, and correlate with the same vascular illustrations as in 
the previous edition.
Third, brain herniation is ubiquitous in cases of trauma to the head 
that results in an increase in intracranial pressure. Sulci and cisterns 
may be obliterated, and the brain may be extruded from one compart-
ment into another. Herniation may be silent or, more likely, may result 
in deﬁcits reﬂecting the particular brain region damaged. Herniation 
syndromes have elegant anatomical correlates; in most of these cases, 
there is a close correlation between the brain structures injured and the 
deﬁcits experienced by the patient. Recognizing the intimate relation-
ship between function and structure, a new and succinct chapter on 
“Herniation Syndromes” (Chapter 9) is introduced. It is placed at this 
location since a mastery of systems neurobiology (from Chapter 8) will 
greatly expedite an understanding of the clinical implications of a her-
niation be it of the brain or of an intervertebral disc.
Fourth, the existing color coronal forebrain images in Chapter 6 and 
the axial and sagittal brain images in Chapter 7 were replaced with new 
high-quality versions of the same pictures. This was accomplished by 
making high-resolution scans of the original glass slides and processing 
them to emphasize clarity and detail.
Fifth, the color images of the spinal cord and the brainstem in Chapter 6, 
although previously scanned from original glass slides, have been care-
fully revised and reprocessed for further detail and clarity. In addition, 
a new cross section has been added to illustrate the fact that the troch-
lear nucleus, decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, substantia 
nigra, and the crus cerebri are characteristic features in a cross section 
of the brainstem at the level of the inferior colliculus.
Sixth, the two line drawings that illustrate the functional compo-
nents of spinal cord and brainstem nuclei that previously appeared at 
the beginning of Chapter 8 have been revised, recolorized, and now 
appear as the introductory two pages for Chapter 6. The revised 
color scheme emphasizes the concept of four functional components 
(although information on the traditional seven functional components 
is still included), an approach that is more in line with contemporary 
developmental studies. The content of these two pages relates directly 
to spinal cord and brainstem nuclei that are shown on subsequent pages 
in Chapter 6 beginning with Figures 6-3A and B. A version of the longi-
tudinal overview (Figure 6-2) also appears next to each stained section 
(e.g., Figure 6-3B) with only the nuclei at that speciﬁc level indicated 
and labeled. The spinal and brainstem nuclei in the line drawings at  
each level in Chapter 6 (e.g., Figure 6-3A) have been revised to match the 
color plate of the repositioned overview. This allows the user to easily 
identify the nuclei at that level, their functional component, and their 
continuity with other related nuclei of comparable function above and 
below that particular level.
Preface to the Ninth Edition
he ﬁrst edition of this book contained several unique features, 
one of which was a particular emphasis on clinical correla-
tions. This approach was one of several guiding principles 
that were followed through subsequent editions. By the seventh and 
eighth editions, many ﬁgure descriptions contained over 50% clinical 
information.
The Ninth Edition continues and improves the approach of empha-
sizing clinical relevance. Clinical content has been revised and increased 
throughout all chapters, and an all-new chapter on herniation syndromes 
has been added, all while maintaining an appropriate level of relevant 
neuroanatomical detail. Recognizing this continuing, and expanded, 
emphasis on clinically relevant neurobiology, the title has been modi-
ﬁed to Neuroanatomy in Clinical Context to more accurately reﬂect 
these important long-term features of this Atlas. The subtitle, An Atlas 
of Structures, Sections, Systems, and Syndromes, has also been slightly 
modiﬁed to reﬂect the past and continuing emphasis on syndromes as 
well as the addition of new syndromes describing brain herniations and 
disc extrusions.
This new edition of Neuroanatomy in Clinical Context continues 
to: (1) provide a sound anatomical base for integrating neurobiological 
and clinical concepts; (2) introduce new text, MRI, CT, and artwork 
that emphasize information and concepts that are encountered in the 
clinical setting; (3) utilize contemporary clinical and basic science ter-
minology; and (4) emphasize neuroscience information, concepts, and 
images that collectively constitute a comprehensive overview of systems 
neurobiology. In addition, the revision of existing pages, the addition of 
new pages in some chapters, and the inclusion of a new chapter on her-
niations, have resulted in an increase in the number of MRI, CT, CTA, 
and angiograms from about 260 to over 380. Understanding systems 
neurobiology is an absolutely essential element in the successful diagno-
sis and treatment of the neurologically compromised patient.
Many comments, suggestions, insights, and ideas from my colleagues, 
medical students, residents, and graduate students have been factored 
into the modiﬁcations in this new edition; their candor is greatly appre-
ciated. While minor corrections, or changes, have been made on almost 
every page, the major improvements and new information introduced in 
the Ninth Edition of Neuroanatomy in Clinical Context are as follows:
First, all clinical information throughout the Atlas appears in a light 
blue screen. This: (1) makes it very easy to identify any and all clinical 
comments, or examples, on every page; (2) does not reduce clinical con-
cepts by trying to compress them into small summary boxes; (3) keeps 
all clinical correlations and information in their proper neuroanatomi-
cal context; and (4) emphasizes the overall amount—and relevance—of 
the clinical information presented in this Atlas. This approach allows 
the user to proceed from a basic point to a clinical point or from a clini-
cal point to a basic point, without a break in the ﬂow of information, 
or the need to go to a different page. This greatly expedites the learning 
process.
Second, all gross spinal cord and brain images in Chapters 2 
and 3 now appear in color. In some cases, original specimens were 
T

Seventh, many other minor adjustments have been made through-
out; these include, labeling changes and/or corrections, adding and/or 
relocating CT and MRI (both normal and abnormal) for a better cor-
relation, clarifying clinical and neuroanatomical information, stressing 
a better correlation between structure and function, bolding key terms 
while retaining italics for emphasis of important points, and integrating 
tidbits of information that are encountered in the initial educational 
experience and that certainly energize the learning opportunity.
Two further issues ﬁgured prominently in this new edition. First, 
the question of whether, or not, to use eponyms in their possessive 
form. To paraphrase one of my clinical colleagues, “Parkinson did not 
die of his disease (so-called ‘Parkinson’ disease); he died of a stroke. 
It was never his own personal disease.” There are rare exceptions, 
such as Lou Gehrig disease, but the point is well taken. McKusick 
(1998a,b) also has made compelling arguments in support of using 
the nonpossessive form of eponyms. However, it is acknowledged that 
views differ on this question—much like debating how many angels 
can dance on the head of a pin. Consultation with my neurology and 
neurosurgery colleagues, the style adopted by Dorland’s Illustrated 
Medical Dictionary (2012) and Stedman’s Medical Dictionary (2006), 
a review of some of the more comprehensive neurology texts (e.g., 
Rowland and Pedley, 2010; Ropper and Samuels, 2009), the standards 
established in the Council of Biology Editors Manual for Authors, 
Editors, and Publishers (1994), and the American Medical Associa-
tion’s Manual of Style (2007) clearly indicate an overwhelming prefer-
ence for the nonpossessive form. Recognizing that many users of this 
book will enter clinical training, it was deemed appropriate to encour-
age a contemporary approach. Consequently, the nonpossessive form 
of the eponym is used.
The second issue concerns use of the most up-to-date anatomical 
terminology. With the publication of Terminologia Anatomica (Thieme, 
New York, 1998), a new ofﬁcial international list of anatomical terms 
for neuroanatomy is available. This new publication, having been 
adopted by the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists, 
supersedes all previous terminology lists. Every effort has been made 
to incorporate any applicable new or modiﬁed terms into this book. In 
addition, the well-reasoned modiﬁcation in the Edinger-Westphal termi-
nology that reﬂects its functional characteristics is also adapted for this 
Atlas (Kozicz et al., 2011). The Edinger-Westphal complex consists of 
an Edinger-Westphal preganglionic nucleus (EWpg) that projects spe-
cially to the ciliary ganglion and a Edinger-Westphal centrally projecting 
nucleus (EWcp) that projects to a variety of targets including the spi-
nal cord, spinal trigeminal, cuneate, gracile, facial, inferior olivary, and 
parabrachial nuclei, and to the reticular formation, but does not project 
to the ciliary ganglion.
Lastly, the pagination of the Ninth Edition has been slightly modiﬁed 
to accommodate changes which have increased integration, introduced 
signiﬁcant new clinical correlates and images, repositioned a few images 
to enhance learning opportunities and the overall ﬂow of information, 
and to accommodate new pages and a new chapter on herniation syn-
dromes. A sampling of Q&As are included in this print version with a 
much larger sample available online through 
. All the Q&As 
have been revised and updated to assist the user in practicing his or her 
level of understanding, comprehension, and competence.

patiently cleaned and adjusted brightness, color, and contrast to 
improve the color images of the stained sections in Chapters 6 and 
7. Mr. Bill Armstrong (Manager of Biomedical Photography) and Mr. 
Robert W. Gray (Biomedical Photography) photographed new brain 
and spinal cord specimens for this edition. I am enormously appre-
ciative of the time, energy, dedication, and professionalism of these 
individuals to create the best possible images, photographs, artwork, 
and ﬁnished plates for this new edition. Their interest in going the 
extra mile to “get it perfect,” and their outstanding cooperation (and, 
I might add, patience) with the author, is greatly appreciated. They are 
not only skilled professionals but also great friends. Ms. Lisa Boyd, 
who has helped me on several editions, provided important typing 
assistance.
Over the years, many colleagues, friends, and students (now faculty 
or medical/dental practitioners) have made many helpful comments.

Acknowledgments
y basic science colleagues in the Department of Neurobiology 
and Anatomical Sciences (Dr. Michael Lehman, chair) and 
my clinical colleagues in the Department of Neurology (Dr. 
Alex Auchus, chair) and the Department of Neurosurgery (Dr. H. Louis 
Harkey, chair), all at The University of Mississippi Medical Center, have 
been very gracious in offering suggestions and comments, both great 
and small, on the revisions for this Ninth Edition. I especially appreciate 
their patience with my repeated inquiries, also great and small. Their 
kindness and outstanding cooperation has directly contributed to the 
educational usefulness of this document.
The modiﬁcations in this Ninth Edition focus on improving the inte-
gration of basic science concepts with the realities of their clinical appli-
cations, and offer several new innovations that make the learning of, 
and the transition between, basic science and clinical concepts easier, 
more ﬂuid, and seamless. The color coding of all clinical information 
throughout the text, addition of new clinically relevant information and 
examples, and the upgrading of contemporary anatomical and clinical 
concepts and terms are but some examples.
A special thank you is due the following individuals: Drs. Bishnu 
Sapkota and David Sinclair (Neurology); Drs. Robert McGuire and 
William McCluskey (Orthopedics); Drs. Louis Harkey and Andy Par-
ent (Neurosurgery); Dr. Alan Sinning, Mr. Ken Sullivan, and graduate 
student Mr. Martin O. Bohlen (Neurobiology and Anatomical Sci-
ences); medical students Ms. Kelly Brister and Mr. Jarrett R. Morgan 
(for their help with a laminectomy); Dr. Tim McCowan (Radiology); 
Dr. Jonathan Wisco (UCLA, for a great idea that was used in modi-
ﬁed format); Drs. Amy Jones and Bridgett Jones (Resident graduates); 
and Drs. Kim Simpson and Jim Lynch (Neurobiology and Anatomi-
cal Sciences). Their contributions included locating particular cases, 
extensively reviewing new and extant clinical text, unfettered access 
to radiological images, reviewing the previous edition for changes 
(the Joneses), assisting with new brain and spinal dissections, and for 
responding to numerous general inquiries. I have also greatly appreci-
ated the high quality of my interaction with the Residents in Neurol-
ogy and Neurosurgery. The cooperation with all of the above was a 
signiﬁcant, and important aspect of getting this Ninth Edition done. 
There has been a long history of excellent cooperation and cross talk 
between all of these clinical departments and Neurology and Anatomi-
cal Sciences.
The reviewers commissioned by LWW were: Pheobe Askie, Onita 
Bhattasali, Dr. Charles Hubscher, Douglas James, Dr. Pétur H. Petersen, 
Dr. Johannes van Loon, and Dr. Stephney Whillier. Their time and 
energy represented an essential element in this new edition.
Modiﬁcations, both great and small, to the existing artwork and 
labeling scheme, and the generation of many new renderings, tables, 
and compiling plates, were the work of Mr. Michael Schenk (Director 
of Biomedical Illustration Services) and Mr. Walter (Kyle) Cunningham

this project. Their cooperation has given me the opportunity to make 
the improvements seen herein.
Lastly, but clearly not least, I want to express a special thanks to my 
wife, Gretchen. The signiﬁcant changes made in this edition required 
attention to many, and multiple, details. She carefully and critically 
reviewed the text, patiently listened to more neurobiology than she 
could have ever imagined, and gleefully informed me about rules of 
grammar and punctuation that I am not sure I even knew existed. I 
gladly dedicate this Ninth Edition to Gretchen.

his new edition of Neuroanatomy in Clinical Context con-
tinues to emphasize brain anatomy in a clinically relevant 
format. This includes: (1) correlating the central nervous sys-
tem (CNS) anatomy with magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and com-
puted tomography (CT) throughout, and making these latter images 
available to teach basic neurobiology; (2) introducing numerous clini-
cal terms, phrases, and examples in their proper context; (3) highlight-
ing cerebrovascular anatomy and selected variations, all with clinical 
examples; (4) emphasizing regional brain anatomy, internal vascular 
territories throughout the CNS, and the myriad deﬁcits resulting from 
vascular lesions as broadly deﬁned; and (5) presenting an extensive 
treatment of systems neurobiology that integrates pathways, connec-
tions, blood supply, and deﬁcits at all levels of the neural axis.
A major innovation in this new edition is the presentation of all clinical 
information in a light blue screen throughout the text. This: (1) makes it 
very easy to identify any and all clinical comments, or examples; (2) does 
not reduce clinical concepts to small summary boxes; (3) keeps all clinical 
correlations and information in their proper context; and (4) emphasizes 
the overall amount—and relevance—of the clinical information pre-
sented. This approach allows the user to proceed from a basic point to a 
clinical point or from a clinical point to a basic point, without a break in 
the ﬂow of information, or the need to go to a different page.
The opportunity to view, study, and understand CNS anatomy in 
both Anatomical and Clinical Orientations continues to be provided, 
and emphasized. The style of presentation, sequence of topics (from 
external CNS anatomy, to internal details, to regions, to systems), and 
emphasis on clinical application expedite learning and understanding 
that will be eminently useful in the clinical years. This approach allows 
for learning concepts in a basic neurobiologic setting that can be seam-
lessly transferred to, and applied within, the clinical environment. A 
focused approach in this new edition is to continue the emphasis on 
integration of basic science with clinical application.
Recognizing that about 50% of intracranial events that result in 
neurological deﬁcits are vascular in nature, as broadly deﬁned, vascular 
anatomy, distribution territories, and vascular patterns and variations 
thereof are covered in appropriate detail. These related topics, and their 
clinical correlations are discussed and illustrated, to varying degrees, 
with computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance 
angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) in all 
chapters. Recognizing vascular patterns, territories, variations, and the 
appearance of extravasated blood is central to a successful diagnosis.
A thorough knowledge and understanding of systems, reﬂexes, path-
ways, their blood supply, and the results of lesions thereof, are essential 
to diagnosis of the neurologically compromised patient. All of these top-
ics are covered in this new edition. Put simply, the deﬁcits seen in many 
patients who present with neurologic consequences are a direct reﬂec-
tion of damage to functional systems that convey information from the 
periphery to targets in the brainstem or forebrain, or centrally gener-
ated signals that convey information that inﬂuences motor activity. A 
thorough knowledge of systems neurobiology (sensory and motor path-
ways, spinal and brainstem reﬂexes) is absolutely essential. A concurrent 
understanding of the appearance and relationships of brain regions in 
MRI and CT is an integral part of the diagnostic effort. Systems traverse 
regions; it is not possible to become competent in one and not the other.
Frequent cross-references are included (ﬁgure and page number) to 
allow easy integration between chapters. In addition, the number of 
images (CT, CTA, MRI, MRA, MRV, angiograms, and venograms) has 
been increased from about 260 to more than 390 in this new edition. 
The use of these images in a contemporary educational setting is abso-
lutely essential for preparing the student for the realities of the clinical 
experience. In the clinical years, the student will not be studying gross 
brain or stained slices, but will rely almost exclusively on CT, MRI, or 
variations on these modalities. The goal is to give students the knowl-
edge base and skills needed to excel in the clinical environment.
Imaging the Brain (CT and MRI)
Imaging the brain in vivo is now commonplace for the patient with 
neurological deﬁcits. With this in mind, it is appropriate to make a few 
general comments on these imaging techniques and what is routinely 
seen, or best seen, in each. For details, consult sources such as Buxton,1
Grossman,2 Harnsberger et al.,3 Lee et al.,4 or Osborn et al.5
Computed Tomography (CT)
In CT, the patient is passed between a source of x-rays and a series of 
detectors. Tissue density is measured by the effects of x-rays on atoms 
within the tissue as x-rays pass through the tissue. Atoms of higher 
number have a greater ability to attenuate (stop) x-rays, whereas those 
with lower numbers are less able to attenuate x-rays. The various attenu-
ation intensities are computerized into numbers (Hounsﬁeld units or CT 
numbers). Bone is given the value of +1,000 and is white, whereas air is 
given a value of −1,000 and is black. In this respect, a lesion or defect in a 
CT that is hyperdense is shifted toward the appearance of bone; it is more 
white. For example, acute subarachnoid blood in CT is hyperdense to the 
surrounding brain; it is more white than the brain and is shifted more to 
the appearance of bone (Figure 1-1). A lesion in CT that is hypodense 
is shifted toward the appearance of air or cerebrospinal ﬂuid; it is more 
black than the surrounding brain (Figure 1-2). In this example, the terri-
tory of the middle cerebral artery is hypodense (Figure 1-2). Isodense in 
CT refers to a condition in which the lesion and the surrounding brain 
have textures and/or shades of gray that are essentially the same. Iso- 
is Greek for equal: “equal density.” Extravascular blood, an enhanced 
tumor, fat, the brain (gray and white matter), and cerebrospinal ﬂuid 
form an intervening continuum from white to black. In general, Table 1-1 
summarizes the white to black intensities seen for selected tissues in CT.
The advantages of CT are: (1) it is done rapidly, which is especially 
important in trauma; (2) it clearly shows acute and subacute hemorrhages 
into the meningeal spaces and brain; (3) it is especially useful for children 
in trauma cases; (4) it shows bone (and skull fractures) to advantage; and 
(5) it is less expensive than MRI. The disadvantages of CT are: (1) it does 
not clearly show acute or subacute infarcts or ischemia, or brain edema;

(2) it does not clearly differentiate white from gray matter within the brain 
nearly as well as MRI; and (3) it exposes the patient to ionizing radiation.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
The tissues of the body contain proportionately large amounts of protons 
(hydrogen). Protons have a positive nucleus, a shell of negative electrons, and 
a north and south pole; they function like tiny spinning bar magnets. Nor-
mally, these atoms are arranged randomly in relation to each other because 
of the constantly changing magnetic ﬁeld  produced by the electrons. MRI 
uses this characteristic of protons to generate images of the brain and body.
When radio waves are sent in short bursts into the magnet con-
taining the patient, they are called a radiofrequency pulse (RP). This 
pulse may vary in strength. When the frequency of the RP matches the 
frequency of the spinning proton, the proton will absorb energy from 
the radio wave (resonance). The effect is twofold. First, the magnetic 
effects of some protons are canceled out; second, the magnetic effects 
and energy levels in others are increased. When the RP is turned off, the 
relaxed protons release energy (an “echo”) that is received by a coil and 
computed into an image of that part of the body.
The two major types of MRI images (MRI/T1 and MRI/T2) are related 
to the effect of RP on protons and the reactions of these protons (relaxa-
tion) when the RP is turned off. In general, those canceled-out protons 
return slowly to their original magnetic strength. The image constructed 
from this time constant is called T1 (Figure 1-3). On the other hand, those 
protons that achieved a higher-energy level (were not canceled out) lose

their energy more rapidly as they return to their original state; the image 
constructed from this time constant is T2 (Figure 1-4). The creation of a 
T1-weighted image versus a T2-weighted image is based on a variation in 
the times used to receive the “echo” from the relaxed protons.
The terms hyperintense, hypointense, and isointense apply to 
T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Hyperintense in T1 is a shift toward the 
appearance of fat, which is white in the normal patient; a hyperintense 
lesion in T1 is more white than the surrounding brain (Figure 1-5A;  
Table 1-2). A meningioma, and the surrounding edematous areas, are 
hyperintense: more white than the surrounding brain (Figure 1-5A). In 
T2, hyperintense is a shift toward the appearance of cerebrospinal ﬂuid, 
which is also white in the normal individual (Figure 1-4); a  hyperintense 
condition in T2 is also more white than the surrounding brain  
(Table 1-2). Hypointense in both T1 and T2 is a shift toward the 
 appearance of air or bone in the normal patient; this is a shift to more 
black than the surrounding brain. In this example, there are hypointense 
areas (arrows) adjacent to the lateral ventricles in the frontal and occipital 
areas (Figure 1-5B). Isointense refers to a situation in which a lesion and 
the surrounding brain have shades of gray and/or textures that are basi-
cally the same. In this example of a pituitary tumor in a T1 MRI, the color 
and texture of the tumor is essentially the same as the surrounding brain; 
it is isointense (Figure 1-5C). Iso- is Greek for equal: “equal intensity.”

number of variations on these two general MRI themes are routinely seen 
in the clinical environment.
The advantages of MRI are: (1) it can be manipulated to visualize a wide 
variety of abnormalities or abnormal states within the brain; and (2) it can 
show great detail of the brain in normal and abnormal states. The disad-
vantages of MRI are: (1) it does not show acute or subacute subarachnoid 
hemorrhage or hemorrhage into the substance of the brain in any detail; (2) 
it takes much longer to do and, therefore, is not useful in acute situations 
or in some types of trauma; (3) it is comparatively more expensive than CT; 
and (4) the scan is extremely loud and may require sedation in children. The 
ensuing discussion brieﬂy outlines the salient features of individual chapters.
Chapter 2
This chapter presents: (1) the gross anatomy of the spinal cord and its prin-
cipal arteries; and (2) the external morphology of the brain from all views, 
including the insular cortex, accompanied by MRIs and drawings of the vas-
culature patterns from the same perspectives. In this new edition, all gross 
brain images appear in color, two new images have been included but none 
eliminated, and clinical terminology such as that used for segments of the 
cerebral vessels (A1–A5, M1–M4, and P1–P4), continues to be emphasized. In 
addition, new line drawings and accompanying CT that focus on vascular 
variations that have clinical implications are featured in this chapter.
Chapter 3
This chapter focuses on: (1) the relationships of cranial nerves; (2) their 
exits from the brainstem; (3) their appearance in representative MRI; 
and (4) examples of cranial nerve deﬁcits seen in cases with lesions of 
the brainstem. All of the gross brain images showing the positions of 
cranial nerves now appear in color and minor corrections have been 
made in Table 3-1. The detailed cross-reference to other sections or 
pages in the Atlas where additional cranial nerve information is found 
was also revised. The ﬁgure descriptions were updated to increase their 
clinical value and relevance.
Chapter 4
The structure of the meninges, and their appearance in MRI or CT, 
is affected by a wide variety of events such as infections (meningitis), 
trauma, vascular incidents (epidural, subdural, subarachnoid hem-
orrhage), and tumor (meningioma) all of which are featured in this 
chapter. In addition, they are a central element in cases of increased 
intracranial pressure and consequent herniation. The size, shape, and 
relations of the ventricular system are clearly correlated with the dis-
tribution of intraventricular blood, and tumors of the choroid plexus; 
all of which are illustrated and described in this chapter. New clinical 
 correlations have been added and all ﬁgure descriptions updated.
Chapter 5
The general morphology of the forebrain and brainstem is continued into 
the two sections of Chapter 5. A major improvement in this chapter is the 
replacement of all black/white photographs with comparable color images in 
the same coronal and axial planes and at the same general levels in each plane. 
A second change was to colorize the orientation drawings (upper left on each 
page) and to orient the axial drawing so as to increase its informational value.

1: Introduction and User’s Guide
The MRIs have been reorganized, and in several cases new ones 
inserted, so as to maintain the remarkably close correlation between 
structures identiﬁed in the brain slice and the same structures seen in 
the corresponding MRIs. The MRI and the brain slice appear on the 
same page so the correlation can be instantly made. Since brain sections 
at autopsy or in clinic–pathologic conferences are viewed as unstained 
specimens, the preference here is to present this material in a format that 
will most closely parallel what is seen in these clinical settings.
Chapter 6
The improvements made to this chapter are far-reaching, signiﬁcant, 
and greatly improve its educational value and clinical emphasis, while 
retaining the innovations, overall organization, and sequence of ear-
lier editions. Although many minor modiﬁcations were made, only the 
more encompassing are mentioned here.
First, the drawings and text explaining the functional components of the 
spinal cord and brainstem sensory and motor nuclei have always appeared 
at the beginning of Chapter 8 as Figures 8-1 and 8-2. Unfortunately, in this 
location, the succeeding images in Chapter 8 were concerned with neural 
systems and not particularly with the spinal cord or brainstem nuclei.
To redress this matter, these two images were moved to the beginning of 
Chapter 6, where they now appear as Figures 6-1 and 6-2. In this new loca-
tion, their content, sensory and motor nuclei of the spinal cord and brain-
stem, relate directly to, and correlate with, the structures shown on the 
succeeding 25 or so pages regarding all levels of the spinal cord and brain-
stem. This new location recognizes the functional and structural related-
ness to the information on the immediately following pages of this chapter.
Second, concurrent with relocating these images to Figures 6-1 and 
6-2, both drawings were recolored based on newer thinking in devel-
opmental biology. The traditional view of seven functional components 
has been supplemented with a more contemporary view that these seven 
may be condensed into four functional components. To this end, the 
color coding has been simpliﬁed to four colors that correspond with 
the four functional components. However, the text and ﬁgure labels 
explaining the traditional and contemporary versions are both pre-
sented so that the user may adopt/adapt whichever view works best in a 
given educational setting. Both the traditional and contemporary views 
are correct, to a large extent interchangeable, and useful.
Third, relocating the functional component images to Chapter 6 
allowed for one of these images to be used, in a slightly modiﬁed for-
mat, on all spinal cord and brainstem images in this chapter. A version 
of Figure 6-2 was placed next to the stained image on the right-hand 
page (e.g., 6-4B), a line placed thereon representing the level of that spe-
ciﬁc cross section, and only those nuclei were labeled (in this case, spinal 
cord) that appear at this particular level (Figure 1-6). This approach was 
used on all spinal cord and brainstem levels in Chapter 6 and allows the 
user to easily visualize the relationships and continuity of functionally 
related cell columns at any level.
Fourth, the revised color palate was also used on the line drawings 
of the spinal cord and brainstem for all sensory and motor nuclei. For 
example, the line drawing in Figure 6-4A (facing 6-4B) now matches the 
overall color scheme (Figure 1-6). Consequently, the color of the spinal 
cord and brainstem sensory and motor nuclei on all left-hand pages is 
consistent throughout. All color coding matches in all drawings and at 
all levels of detail from Figure 6-3A to 6-28B throughout Chapter 6.
Fifth, the following structures are characteristically found at the level 
of a cross section through the inferior colliculus: the nuclei of the inferior 
colliculus, the trochlear nucleus, the decussation of the superior cerebellar 
peduncle, and caudal parts of the substantia nigra. A set of pages (line 
drawing and stained section) was added that illustrates these relationships.
Sixth, the color images of the spinal cord and brainstem in Chapter 
6 had previously been scanned from the original glass slide; for this new 
edition these images were reprocessed to improve clarity and detail. The 
color images of the coronal sections of the forebrain in Chapter 6 were 
replaced with high-resolution color scans of original glass slides and 
then processed to bring out the best detail and clarity possible.
Innovations that were introduced in recent editions that integrated 
clinical with anatomical information, that provided options for viewing 
images in a format consistent with that seen in the clinical environment, 
and that stressed the clinical relevance and applicability of basic neuro-
biology are further emphasized in this new edition. First, the ability to 
ﬂip an image from an Anatomical Orientation to a Clinical Orientation 
places everything in the image (line drawing or stained section) into a 
clinical format: (1) the images match exactly the corresponding MRI or 
CT, (2) the image has right and left sides, and (3) the topography of all 
tracts and nuclei in ﬂipped images matches that as seen in CT or MRI. 
All images in Chapter 6 that can be ﬂipped to a Clinical Orientation are 
identiﬁed by this symbol in the lower left of the image.
Understanding the brain and its internal structures in Clinical Ori-
entation is absolutely essential to successful diagnosis. Second, the 
inherent value of viewing brain anatomy and line drawings in a Clinical 
Orientation is stressed throughout this chapter, particularly in relation 
to somatotopy, vascular supply and territories, clinical examples, and 
the MRI or CT, most of which are featured on the same page as the line 
drawing or stained section. Third, the color keys have been revised to 
reﬂect the modiﬁed color palate for the sensory and motor nuclei of the 
spinal cord and brainstem. Fourth, continuity from Anatomical Orien-
tation to Clinical Orientation is again illustrated in a series of line draw-
ings and MRI and CT on odd numbered pages showing spinal cord and 
brainstem levels (Figure 1-7). This new edition continues to utilize CT 
cisternograms as an integral part of the learning experience (Figure 1-8).

Chapter 7
The arrangement of pages in this chapter remains the same as in previous 
editions: axial brain images in color and the corresponding axial MRI 
are on left-hand pages and sagittal brain images in color and the cor-
responding sagittal MRI are on right-hand pages. The heavy red line on 
the axial images (odd numbered Figures 7-1 to 7-9) indicates the plane of 
section of the sagittal image on the facing page; similarly, the heavy red 
line on the sagittal images (even numbered Figures 7-2 to 7-10) indicates 
the plane of section of the axial image on the facing page. Correlations 
between stained slices and between structures in MRI can be easily made.
A signiﬁcant new improvement in this chapter is that high-resolution 
scans of the original stained sections mounted on glass slides were made 
and carefully processed for clarity and detail. This resulted in images of 
high quality in which internal detail is enhanced and anatomical rela-
tionships of all structures are more apparent.
The ability to compare different planes of section (stained section and 
MRI) on facing pages allows the user to build a three-dimensional view 
of a variety of internal structures in images that are commonly available 
in the clinical environment. However, these images can also be viewed 
as an axial series (all left-hand pages) or a sagittal series (all right-hand 
pages). Educational ﬂexibility is inherent within these arrangements.
Chapter 8
This chapter illustrates a wide variety of clinically relevant CNS tracts/
pathways in both Anatomical and Clinical Orientations, includes 15 
illustrations of pathways of spinal and brainstem reﬂexes that may be 
tested during a comprehensive neurological examination, and contains 
literally dozens of clinical correlations or examples. The following fea-
tures enhance the user’s comprehension of information and concepts 
that are directly relevant to diagnosing the impaired patient. First, 
inclusion of comprehensive pathways in an atlas format allows for the 
learning of clinically relevant concepts in a variety of settings: lecture, 
laboratory, self-study, small group, and during clinical rotations. Sec-
ond, pathways that are most important to developing diagnostic skills 
are presented in Anatomical and Clinical Orientations which show: (1) 
its origin, extent, course, and termination; (2) laterality, an enormously 
important clinical concept; (3) position throughout the neural axis and 
its decussation, if applicable; (4) somatotopy within tracts; and (5) the 
blood supply at all levels. Third, a brief summary of the principal neu-
roactive substances associated with many pathways, whether they result 
in excitation (+) or inhibition (−) at their receptor sites, and deﬁcits that 
may correlate with the loss of particular neurotransmitters is included. 
Fourth, clinical correlations accompany each pathway drawing; these 
describe deﬁcits, lesions, clinical terminology, and laterality of deﬁcits 
at different levels of the pathway. In toto, the drawings in Chapter 8 
provide a maximal amount of clinically relevant information; each in a 
single easy-to-follow illustration.
Interspersed within this chapter are 13 sets (26 pages) of illustrations 
presented in Clinical Orientation that immediately follow, and comple-
ment, the corresponding pathway presented in Anatomical Orientation 
(Figures 1-9 and 1-10). These clinical illustrations overlay MRIs, focus 
on cranial nerves and long tracts that are especially important to the 
diagnosis of the impaired patient. This approach recognizes that in some 
educational settings pathways are taught anatomically, while in others 
the emphasis is on a Clinical Orientation; both approaches are accom-
modated in this atlas. It is, however, important to emphasize that when 
viewing MRI or CT of a patient compromised by neurologic lesion or 
disease, all of the internal brain anatomy and all tracts, including their 
somatotopy, are seen in a Clinical Orientation. It is absolutely essential 
that the user recognize and understand this fact of clinical reality.
Since all possible pathways that may be taught in a given neuro-
biology course cannot be anticipated, ﬂexibility is designed into this 
chapter. The last ﬁgure in each section is a blank master drawing that 
follows the same format as the preceding ﬁgures. These may be used for 
learning, review, practicing pathways, in an instructional setting, and as 
a substrate for examination questions.

close correlation between structures damaged resultant to a herniation and 
the predictable deﬁcits. There are elegant, and in many  situations, remark-
ably precise correlations between the deﬁcits experienced by the patient 
and the structures damaged in herniation syndromes; in some cases the def-
icits accurately predict the type and location of the herniation. Recognizing 
that brain herniations share general features in common with interverte-
bral disc extrusions, selected spinal cord syndromes are included to offer a 
more complete picture of this general phenomenon.
There is a ﬁnite amount of space in the cranial cavity; small space-
taking events may temporarily be accommodated, while large and 
especially rapidly occurring events are not tolerated. Anything that 
compromises this ﬁnite amount of space, such as a tumor, hemorrhagic 
event, brain edema, or any of a number of other causes, may result in 
increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and a cascade of events that leads 
to herniation of the brain from one location/compartment to another; 
these are commonly called herniation syndromes. A herniation may be 
silent with deﬁcits to follow later, or may result in sudden and poten-
tially catastrophic deﬁcits; in some cases, and if untreated, death may 
follow within minutes.
Increased ICP may be signaled by effacement of sulci or cisterns or a 
shift in brain structures that may be subtle, particularly in an isodense 
CT, or obvious as in an edematous tumor. Once evidence of ICP has 
been determined, a course of treatment is put in motion to guard against 
further deterioration.
Chapter 10
This chapter contains a series of angiograms (arterial and venous phases), 
MRA images, and MRV images. The angiograms are shown in lateral and 
anterior–posterior projections—some as standard views with correspond-
ing digital subtraction images. MRA and MRV technology are noninva-
sive methods that allow for the visualization of arteries (MRA) and veins 
and venous sinuses (MRV). However, there are many situations when both 
arteries and veins are seen with either method. Use of MRA and MRV is 
commonplace, and this technology is an important diagnostic tool.
Chapter 11
The questions and corresponding answers of Chapter 11 recognize 
that examinations are an essential part of the educational proc-
ess and that these elements should prepare, as much as reasonably 
possible, the user for future needs and expectations. Many are pre-
pared as a patient vignette and in the USMLE Step-1 style (single best 
answer) which emphasize: (1) anatomical and clinical correlations; 
(2) application of basic neurobiology concepts to clinical practice; 
(3) integration of regional neurobiology, systems neurobiology, neu-
rovascular patterns, and disease processes; and (4) the topographical 
maps within motor and sensory systems as related to lesions of tracts, 
nuclei, and the cerebral cortex.
While generally grouped by chapter, questions may draw on infor-
mation from more than one chapter thus reﬂecting the reality of many 
major examinations. Correct answers are given, incorrect answers are

Overview of a posterior aspect of the spinal cord from C2–T1 
(A) and details from the same specimen showing the C2–C4 
and C7–T1 levels (B, C). The denticulate ligaments anchor the spinal 
cord within the dural sac; they are pial tissue sheets that extend laterally 
to attach to the arachnoid on the inner surface of the dura. The acces-
sory nerve courses between the anterior and posterior roots (B) and the 
posterior surface of the cord clearly shows structures and sulci charac-
teristic of the posterior column system (C).
Posterior and anterior spinal medullary arteries accompany their 
respective roots (Figure 2-3 on facing page) and the radicular arteries 
supply their respective roots. The posterior spinal artery is located 
2-1
medial to the posterior root entry zone and the anterior spinal artery is 
in the anterior median sulcus (Figure 2-3 on facing page).
 Radiculopathy results from spinal nerve root damage. The most 
common causes are intervertebral disc disease/protrusion or spondylol-
ysis, and the main symptoms are pain radiating in a root or dermatomal 
distribution, weakness, and hyporeﬂexia of the muscles served by the 
affected root. The discs most commonly involved at cervical (C) and 
lumbar (L) levels are C6–C7 (65%–70%), C5–C6 (16%–20%), L4–L5 
(40%–45%), and L5–S1 (40%–45%). Thoracic disc problems are rare, 
well under 1% of all disc protrusions. For additional information on 
spinal disc extrusions, see Chapter 9.

Semi-diagrammatic representation showing the origin and gen-

anterior and posterior radicular arteries arise at every spinal level and 
serve their respective roots and ganglia. The anterior and posterior spi-
nal medullary arteries (also called medullary feeder arteries or 
2-3
segmental medullary arteries) arise at intermittent levels and serve to 
augment the blood supply to the spinal cord. The artery of Adamkie-
wicz is an unusually large spinal medullary artery arising usually on the 
left in low thoracic or upper lumbar levels (T9–L1). The arterial vaso-
corona is a diffuse anastomotic plexus covering the cord surface.

Overall posterior (A, B) and sagittal MRI (C, T2-weighted) 
views of the lower thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal spi-
nal cord segments and the cauda equina. The dura and arachnoid are 
retracted in A and B. The cauda equina is shown in situ in A, and in B 
the nerve roots of the cauda equina have been spread laterally to expose 
the conus medullaris and ﬁlum terminale internum. This latter structure 
is also called the pial part of the ﬁlum terminale. See Figures 6-3 and 
6-4 on pp. 98–99 for cross-sectional views of the cauda equina. 
In the sagittal MRI (C), the lower portions of the cord, the ﬁlum 
terminale internum, and cauda equina are clearly seen. In addition, 
the intervertebral discs and the bodies of the vertebrae are clear. The 
lumbar cistern is an enlarged part of the subarachnoid space caudal to 
the end of the spinal cord. This space contains the anterior and poste-
rior roots from the lower part of the spinal cord that collectively form 
the cauda equina. The ﬁlum terminale internum also descends from the 
conus medullaris through the lumbar cistern to attach to the inner 
surface of the dural sac. The dural sac ends at about the level of the S2 
vertebra and is attached to the coccyx by the ﬁlum terminale externum 
2-4
(also see Figure 4-1 on p. 59). A lumbar puncture is made by inserting a 
large-gauge needle (18–22 gauge) between the L4 and L5 (preferred) 
vertebrae or the L3 and L4 vertebrae and retrieving a sample of cere-
brospinal ﬂuid from the lumbar cistern. This sample may be used for a 
number of diagnostic procedures.
A cauda equina syndrome may be seen when an extruded disc (L4–
L5 more common level) that impinges on the cauda equina or in 
patients with tumor, trauma, or other conditions that damage these 
nerve roots. The symptoms are usually bilateral and may include: 1) 
signiﬁcant weakness (paraplegia is a possible outcome) and hypo- or 
areﬂexia of the lower extremity; 2) saddle anesthesia (commonly seen), 
which presents as sensory deﬁcits on the buttocks, medial and posterior 
aspects of thighs, genitalia and anus, and perineum; 3) urinary retention 
(commonly seen) or incontinence, decreased sphincter tone, and fecal 
incontinence; and 4) decrease in sexual function (may appear later if 
cause is left untreated). Although sensory loss is common, these patients 
may or may not experience low back pain or sciatica.

Lateral (A) and medial (B) views of the cerebral hemisphere show-
ing the landmarks used to divide the cortex into its main lobes.
On the lateral aspect, the central sulcus (of Rolando) separates fron-
tal and parietal lobes. The lateral sulcus (of Sylvius) forms the border 
between frontal and temporal lobes. The occipital lobe is located caudal 
to an arbitrary line drawn between the terminus of the parietooccipital 
sulcus and the preoccipital notch. A horizontal line drawn from approx-
imately the upper two-thirds of the lateral ﬁssure to the rostral edge of 
the occipital lobe represents the border between parietal and temporal 
lobes. The insular cortex (see also Figures 2-40 to 2-42 on pp. 36–37) is 
located internal to the lateral sulcus in the general area that is shaded 
gray (A). This part of the cortex is made up of long and short gyri that 
2-5
are separated from each other by the central sulcus of the insula.  
The insula, as a whole, is separated from the adjacent portions of the 
frontal, parietal, and temporal opercula by the circular sulcus. This  
sulcus is generally located at the circumference of the gray area (A); see 
also Figures 2-40 to 2-42 on pp. 36–37.
On the medial aspect, the cingulate sulcus separates medial portions 
of frontal and parietal lobes from the limbic lobe. An imaginary con-
tinuation of the central sulcus intersects with the cingulate sulcus and 
forms the border between frontal and parietal lobes. The parietooccipi-
tal sulcus and an arbitrary continuation of this line to the preoccipital 
notch separate the parietal, limbic, and temporal lobes from the occipi-
tal lobe.

Lateral (A) and medial (B) views of the cerebral hemisphere 
showing the more commonly described Brodmann areas. In 
general, area 4 comprises the primary somatomotor cortex, areas 3, 1, 
and 2 the primary somatosensory cortex, and area 17 the primary vis-
ual cortex. Area 41 is the primary auditory cortex, and the portion of 
area 6 in the caudal part of the middle frontal gyrus is generally recog-
nized as the frontal eye ﬁeld.
The inferior frontal gyrus has three portions: a pars opercularis, a 
pars triangularis, and a pars orbitalis. A lesion that is located primarily 
in areas 44 and 45 (shaded) will give rise to what is called a Broca apha-
sia, also called motor, expressive, or nonﬂuent aphasia. These patients 
do not have paralysis of the vocal apparatus, but rather have great 
2-6
difﬁculty turning ideas into meaningful speech. These patients may 
have mutism or slow, labored speech that consists of familiar single 
words or short phrases with words left out (telegraphic speech). These 
patients are well aware of their deﬁcits.
The inferior parietal lobule consists of supramarginal (area 40) and 
angular (area 39) gyri. Lesions in this general area of the cortex (shaded), 
and sometimes extending into area 22, will give rise to what is known as 
Wernicke aphasia, also sometimes called sensory, receptive, or ﬂuent 
aphasia. Patients with a sensory aphasia speak freely and without hesita-
tion, but what is said may make little sense due to the use of inappropriate 
words at inappropriate places in the sentences (paraphasia, or sometimes 
called word salad). These patients may be unaware of their deﬁcits.

Lateral (A) and medial (B) views of the cerebral hemisphere 
showing the somatotopic organization of the primary somato-
motor and somatosensory cortices. The lower extremity and foot areas 
are located on medial aspects of the hemisphere in the anterior paracen-
tral (motor) and the posterior paracentral (sensory) gyri. The remaining 
portions of the body extend from the margin of the hemisphere over the 
convexity to the lateral sulcus in the precentral and postcentral gyri.
An easy way to remember the somatotopy of these important corti-
cal areas is to divide the precentral and postcentral gyri generally into 
thirds: a lateral third that represents the face area, a middle third that 
represents the upper extremity and hand with particular emphasis on 
the hand, and a medial third that represents the trunk and hip. The rest 
of the body representation, lower extremity and foot, is on the medial 
2-7
aspect of the hemisphere in the anterior (motor) and posterior (sensory) 
paracentral gyri. Lesions of the somatomotor cortex result in motor 
deﬁcits on the contralateral side of the body, whereas lesions in the 
somatosensory cortex result in a loss of sensory perception from the 
contralateral side of the body. The medial surface of the right hemi-
sphere (B) illustrates the position of the left portions of the visual ﬁeld. 
The inferior visual quadrant is located in the primary visual cortex 
above the calcarine sulcus, whereas the superior visual quadrant is found 
in the cortex below the calcarine sulcus. Lesions of visual structures 
caudal to the optic chiasm may result in a contralateral (either left or 
right based on the side of the lesion) homonymous hemianopia or may 
present in other situations as a quadrantanopia.

M2 and M3 segments: see Figures 2-41 and 2-42 on p. 37); these 
branches, when seen on the surface of the hemisphere, represent the M4 
segment. The individual branches of the overall M4 segment are named 
2-12
usually according to their relationship to gyri, sulci, or position on a 
lobe. Terminal branches of the posterior and anterior cerebral arteries 
course over the edges of the temporal and occipital lobes, and parietal 
and frontal lobes, respectively (see Figure 2-9 on p. 15). See Figure 10-1

lower axial plane through the pons when compared to the left MRI, 
which represents a slightly more superior plane. The latter is bor-
dered by the superior cerebellar peduncles. A detailed view of the 
inferior (ventral) aspect of the brainstem is seen in Figure 2-20 on  
p. 22.

Detailed view of the inferior (ventral) aspect of the dien-
cephalon and brainstem with particular emphasis on exit 
and/or entrance points of cranial nerves (CNs II–XII) and the general 
relationships of the optic nerve, chiasm, and tract. Note an important 
relationship: the oculomotor nerve exits between the superior cerebel-
lar and the posterior cerebral (P1 segment of PCA) arteries. In this 
location, it is susceptible to damage from aneurysms arising from the 
basilar bifurcation or from the posterior communicating artery/PCA 
intersection. Such lesions give rise to deﬁcits (seen individually or in 
2-20
combinations) characteristic of third nerve injury, such as dilated 
pupil, loss of most eye movement, and diplopia. Other important 
relationships also include the cranial nerves of the pons–medulla 
junction (VI, VII, VIII) and the cranial nerves associated with the cer-
ebellopontine angle (VII, VIII, IX, X). In this view, it is easy to appre-
ciate the fact that cranial nerves VI–XII occupy a compact area at the 
caudal aspect of the pons and lateral medulla. Lesions in this area 
may result in a variety of cranial nerve, and potentially additional, 
deﬁcits.

Inferior (ventral) view of the brainstem showing the relation-
ship of brain structures and cranial nerves to the arteries 
forming the vertebrobasilar system and the cerebral arterial circle (of 
Willis). The posterior spinal artery usually originates from the posterior 
inferior cerebellar artery (left, about 75% of cases), but it may arise 
from the vertebral artery (right, about 25% of individuals). Although 
the labyrinthine artery may occasionally branch from the basilar (right, 
about 15% of the time), it most frequently originates from the anterior 
inferior cerebellar artery (left, about 85% of cases).
Many vessels that arise ventrally course around the brainstem to 
serve dorsal structures. The anterior cerebral artery consists of A1 
(between the internal carotid bifurcation and the anterior communicat-
ing artery) and segments A2–A5, which are distal to the anterior 
2-21
communicating artery (see Figure 10-3 on p. 312 for details). Lateral to 
the internal carotid bifurcation is the M1 segment of the middle cerebral 
artery (MCA), which usually divides into superior and inferior trunks 
that continue as the M2 segments (branches) on the insular cortex. The 
M3 branches of the MCA are those located on the inner surface of the 
opercula, and the M4 branches are located on the lateral aspect of  
the hemisphere (see Figure 2-42 on p. 37).
Between the basilar bifurcation and the posterior communicating artery 
is the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery; P2 is between the poste-
rior communicator and the ﬁrst temporal branches and P3–P4 are distal to 
this segment. See Figures 10-9, 10-10, and 10-12 (pp. 318, 319, and 321) 
for comparable MRA of the cerebral arterial circle and vertebrobasilar sys-
tem. See Figure 4-10 on p. 68 for the blood supply of the choroid plexus.

Lateral view of the left side of the brainstem where the infe-

this area is commonly called the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The cra-
nial nerves (CNs) related to the CPA in decreasing order, based on the 
deﬁcits seen following lesion/tumors in the CPA, are CNs VII, VIII; less 
2-22
so IX, X, and XI. Although not technically a nerve of the CPA, espe-
cially large lesions (generally larger than 2.0 cm) in this area may extend 
forward and involve CN V with appropriate sensory deﬁcits. Vestibular 
schwannoma is the most common CPA lesion (about 85%) with menin-
gioma a distant second at about 5%–10%.

vestibular schwannoma (mainly CNs VII and VIII). Meningiomas of 
the skull base may involve a number of cranial nerves in different com-
binations.

A colloid cyst (colloid tumor) is a congenital growth usually discov-
ered in adult life once the ﬂow of CSF through the interventricular 
foramina is compromised (obstructive hydrocephalus). The patient may 
have headache, unsteady gait, weakness of the lower extremities, visual 
or somatosensory disorders, and/or personality changes or confusion. 
Treatment is usually by surgical removal.

Midsagittal view of the right cerebral hemisphere and dien-

anterior (ACA) and posterior (PCA) cerebral arteries. The positions of 
gyri and sulci can be extrapolated from Figure 2-26 (facing page). Ter-
minal branches of the anterior cerebral artery arch laterally over the 
edge of the hemisphere to serve medial regions of the frontal and  
2-27
parietal lobes, and the same relationship is maintained for the occipital 
and temporal lobes by branches of the posterior cerebral artery.  
The ACA is made up of segments A1 (precommunicating), A2 (infracal-
losal), A3 (precallosal), and A4 + A5 (supracallosal + postcallosal). See

A midsagittal view of the right cerebral hemisphere and 
diencephalon with the brainstem and cerebellum in situ. 
The MRI (T1-weighted image) shows many brain structures from the 
same perspective. Important cortical relationships in this view 
include the cingulate, parietooccipital, and calcarine sulci; the pri-
mary visual cortex is located on either bank of the calcarine sulcus. 
The cingulate gyrus, medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus, and 
2-29
precuneus occupy much of the medial surface of the hemisphere. 
Note that the medial terminus of the central sulcus is above the 
 splenium of the corpus callosum. This clearly illustrates the fact that 
the primary somatomotor (anterior paracentral gyrus) and 
 somatosensory (posterior paracentral gyrus) cortices for the lower 
extremity are located somewhat caudally on the medial aspect of the 
 hemisphere.

caudal diencephalon. The dashed line on the left represents the posi-
tion of the sulcus limitans and the area of the inferior cerebellar 
peduncle is shown on the right. This structure is composed of the resti-
form body plus the juxtarestiform body, the latter of which contains 
ﬁbers interconnecting the vestibular area in the lateral ﬂoor of the 
fourth ventricle and cerebellar structures (cortex and nuclei). The 
2-31
tuberculum cinereum is also called the trigeminal tubercle (tuberculum 
trigeminale) because it is the surface representation of the spinal 
trigeminal tract and its underlying nucleus on the lateral aspect of the 
medulla just caudal to the level of the obex (see also Figure 2-32 on 
the facing page). The facial colliculus is formed by the underlying 
abducens nucleus and internal genu of the facial nerve, the hypoglos-
sal trigone by the underlying hypoglossal nucleus, and the vagal trig-
one by the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve. Also see 
Figure 2-34 on p. 32.

The view in C shows the aspect of the cerebellum that is continuous 
into the brainstem via cerebellar peduncles. The view in C correlates 
with the superior surface of the brainstem (and middle and superior 
cerebellar peduncles) as shown in Figure 2-31 on p. 30.
Note that the superior view of the cerebellum (A) correlates closely 
with cerebellar structures seen in axial MRIs at comparable levels  
2-37
(D, E). Structures seen on the inferior surface of the cerebellum, such 
as the tonsil (F), correlate closely with an axial MRI at a comparable 
level. In G, note the appearance of the margin of the cerebellum,  
the general appearance and position of the lobes, and the obvious 
nature of the middle cerebellar peduncle. All MRI images are 
T1-weighted.

Semi-diagrammatic cross-sectional representation of the cer-
ebral hemispheres showing the main arteries and veins related 
to the insular cortex. The internal carotid artery branches into the ante-
rior and middle cerebral (MCA) arteries. The ﬁrst segment of the MCA 
(M1) passes laterally and diverges into superior and inferior trunks at 
the limen insulae (entrance to the insular cortex). In general, distal 
branches of the superior trunk course upward and eventually serve the 
cortex above the lateral sulcus, and distal branches of the inferior trunk 
course downward to serve the cortex below the lateral sulcus. En route, 
2-42
these respective branches form the M2 (insular part of MCA), M3 (oper-
cular part of MCA), and M4 (cortical part of MCA) segments, as shown 
here.
The deep middle cerebral vein receives small branches from the area 
of the insula and joins with the anterior cerebral vein to form the basal 
vein (see Figures 2-16 and 2-19 on pp. 19 and 21). The superﬁcial mid-
dle cerebral vein collects blood from the lateral aspect of the hemisphere 
and drains into the cavernous sinus (see also Figures 2-13, 2-16, and 
2-19 on pp. 17, 19, and 21).

Early in development, the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) 
originates from the internal carotid artery (A). At this stage, 
the cerebral arterial circle (circle of Willis) is not complete. Vascular 
sprouts from the basilar artery are growing to meet the PCAs and from 
the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) to meet on the midline where they 
will form the anterior communicating artery (ACom). The initial con-
nection between the basilar artery and the PCA is small (B); this will 
become the adult P1 segment. As development progresses, the initially 
small P1 segment enlarges in diameter (to form the major connection 
between the basilar and the distal PCA, the adult P1) and the initially 
large portion of the PCA between the internal carotid artery and the 
PCA–P1 junction becomes smaller in diameter (to form the posterior 
communicating artery [PCom] of the adult, C).
In 22%–25% of adult individuals, the territory served by the PCA is 
perfused mainly from the internal carotid artery. This is due to the fact 
2-43
that the fetal pattern of the PCA arising from the internal carotid per-
sists into the adult. This is called a fetal PCA, or a persistent fetal PCA. 
Examples of a fetal PCA are shown here in a specimen (D, fetal PCA is 
on the patient’s right, normal pattern on patient’s left) and in MRI (E, 
arrows) and CT angiogram (F, arrows). Note that in the MRI-T2 (E, 
axial), the PCA can be easily followed from the internal carotid into the 
occipital lobe (arrows) with no evidence of any substantive connection 
to a P1.
A fetal PCA in the adult may coexist with other vascular patterns 
that deviate from normal. In the axial images in F and G (CTA), a fetal 
PCA is present on the patient’s left (F, arrows) and in the same patient, a 
single trunk from the left internal carotid artery (G) gives origin to both 
the right and left anterior cerebral arteries (ACA1 becomes the right 
ACA; ACA2 becomes the left ACA). This is an azygous (single or 
unpaired) ACA.

The thalamoperforating arteries (ThalPerArt) arise from the 
P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), the part of 
the PCA located between the bifurcation of the basilar artery and the 
junction of the posterior communicating artery with the PCA. This ves-
sel serves primarily the rostral and medial areas of the thalamus that are 
important synaptic stations in the ascending reticular activating system 
that inﬂuences cortical arousal.
The most common pattern of origin for the thalamoperforating ves-
sels (about 42% of cases) is a single stem artery on each side that 
branches to serve the thalamus on that side (A). One or two single stem 
vessels on one P1 with multiple branches from the opposite P1 (B) are 
seen in about 26% of cases, and small multiple branches from each P1 
(C) are the pattern present in about 20% of cases.
The least common, but perhaps most problematic, pattern is when a 
single stem vessel (sometimes called the artery of Percheron) originates 
2-44
from one P1 and branches to serve both thalami (D); this is seen in 
about 8% of cases. Damage to, or occlusion of, this single stem, or of 
one stem when there is only one on each side, may adversely affect cor-
tical arousal, consciousness, and contribute to drowsiness, stupor, or 
coma (E–G). In patient E (white arrows), a single stem (D) was inad-
vertently trapped during aneurysm surgery, resulting in bilateral lesions 
(hypodensities in the anterior thalamus in CT). Patient F (white arrows) 
had bilateral strokes in the thalamoperforator territory (hyperintensi-
ties in T2, cause unknown); both patients E and F were comatose post 
event. A predominately unilateral stroke in this same arterial territory 
(G, hyperintensity in T2 at white arrow) resulted in a patient that was 
lethargic, in and out of consciousness, and difﬁcult to arouse, but was 
not comatose.

The medial striate artery (MedStrArt), also called the artery 
of Heubner, arises from the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 
the vicinity of its junction with the anterior communicating artery 
(ACom). This intersection is frequently called the “ACA–ACom cor-
ner” (A, D). Structures characteristically found in this area, in addition 
to the vessels, are the optic nerve, chiasm, and tract, adjacent gyri of the 
frontal lobe, subarachnoid cisterns (chiasmatic, of the lamina termina-
lis, interpeduncular), and the lamina terminalis (separating cisterns 
from the third ventricle) (D).
The medial striate artery usually arises from the lateral aspect of 
the ACA. A large sample of cadaver brains (200) and surgical proce-
dures (375) revealed that about 42% arose from the “corner” (A), 
about 26% from proximal A2 (B), and less than 3% from the distal A1 
2-45
(C). Recognizing that the origin of the medial striate artery from the 
ACA may be variable, it is convenient to remember that this vessel 
usually arises at, or just distal, to the corner. Vascular patterns in this 
region are highly variable and include azygous (single) or three A2 seg-
ments, both ACAs arising from one side (Figure 2-43G, p. 38), a dupli-
cated or a fenestrated ACom, and occasional asymmetrical origins of 
its branches.
Aneurysms in this area may arise from the medial aspect of the “cor-
ner” or from the branches of the ACom. When an aneurysm at this 
location ruptures, the extravasated blood may be located in the sub-
arachnoid cisterns in the immediate area, dissect into the frontal lobe, 
or enter the third ventricle, and ventricular system, through damage to 
the lamina terminalis (E).

The lateral striate arteries (LatStrArt) are commonly called 
the lenticulostriate arteries; they arise from the M1 segment 
of the middle cerebral artery in three general patterns. About 40% orig-
inate as a single stem and then branch into numerous vessels that pene-
trate the hemisphere via the anterior perforated substance to serve 
much of the lenticular nucleus and adjacent structures, such as the 
internal capsule (A, E). In approximately 30% of cases, these vessels 
arise as two stems that divide into numerous penetrating branches (B); 
a variation on this theme is one stem with several direct M1 branches 
(C). In a similar numbers of cases (about 30%), the lenticulostriate 
2-46
vessels originate as a series of many small arteries directly from the M1 
segment (D).
Hemorrhage of the lenticulostriate arteries within the hemisphere, 
assuming no occlusion of the parent M1 vessel but with only damage to 
its branches, results in a lesion within the hemisphere with sparing of 
the blood supply (the M1 is patent) to the cerebral cortex (F, lesion on 
right). In contrast, occlusion of the parent vessel, for example the M1 
segment, may result in infarction of all territories served by this vessel 
distal to the obstruction including the basal nuclei, portions of the inter-
nal capsule, and all distal cortex (F, outline on left).

The anterior (AICA) and posterior (PICA) inferior cerebel-
lar arteries originate from the basilar (BA) and vertebral 
arteries (VA) respectively (A). The AICA arises from approximately 
the lower third of the basilar artery in about 75% of patients (A, B). 
In 50%–60% of individuals, it is a single basilar branch on each side, 
two branches in 20%, and three branches in 20%. The labyrinthine 
artery, an important blood supply to the inner ear, arises from  
2-47
the AICA about 85% of the time and from the basilar in 15% of 
 individuals.
The PICA commonly arises as a single branch from each vertebral 
artery (90% of cases) but is duplicated 6% of the time (A, C, D: C and 
D are two different sagittal planes in the same patient to show the con-
tinuity of PICA). In 75% of cases, the posterior spinal artery is a branch 
of PICA; about 25% of the time it is a vertebral branch.

The vertebral arteries (VAs) are generally equal in size in about 
25%–30% of cases, or one may be larger than the other (A, B). 
For example, the left vertebral may be slightly larger about 43% of the 
time (C) and the right vertebral in about 33% of cases (D). In a minority 
2-48
of individuals, either vertebral artery may be hypoplastic (about 4%–6%; 
see also Figure 10-12). In less than 1% of cases, the vertebral artery may 
become the PICA on one side; the other vertebral becoming the basilar. 
Occasionally one of these variations may coexist with a second.

Inferior view of the hemisphere showing the optic nerve (II), 
chiasm, tract, and related structures (A). The MRIs of cranial 
nerve (CN) II are shown in axial (B, T1-weighted; D, T2-weighted) and 
in oblique sagittal (C, T1-weighted) planes. Note the similarity between 
the axial planes, especially (B), and the gross anatomical specimen. In 
addition, note the relationship between the anterior cerebral artery, 
anterior communicating artery, and the structures around the optic 
 chiasm (D).
The anterior communicating artery or its junction with the anterior 
cerebral artery (D) is the most common site of supratentorial (carotid 
system) aneurysms. Rupture of aneurysms at this location is one of the 
more common causes of spontaneous (also called nontraumatic) sub-
3-1
arachnoid hemorrhage. The proximity of these vessels to optic struc-
tures and the hypothalamus (D) explains the variety of visual and 
hypothalamic disorders that may be experienced by these patients. A 
lesion of the optic nerve results in blindness in that eye and loss of the 
afferent limb of the pupillary light reﬂex. Lesions caudal to the optic 
chiasm result in deﬁcits in the visual ﬁelds of both eyes (contralateral 
[right or left] homonymous hemianopia).
The anterior choroidal artery serves the optic tract and portions of 
the internal capsule immediately internal to this structure. This explains 
the unusual combination of a homonymous hemianopia coupled with a 
contralateral hemiplegia and hemianesthesia (to all somatosensory 
modalities) in the anterior choroidal artery syndrome.

That portion of the posterior cerebral artery located between the 
basilar artery and posterior communicating artery (A) is the P1 segment. 
The most common site of aneurysms in the infratentorial area (verte-
brobasilar system) is at the bifurcation of the basilar artery, also called 
the basilar tip. Patients with aneurysms at this location may present 
with eye movement disorders, pupillary dilation caused by damage to 
the root of the third nerve, and diplopia.
Rupture of a basilar tip aneurysm may result in the cardinal signs (sud-
den severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and possibly syncope) that signal a 
stroke as broadly deﬁned. In addition, the extravasated blood may dissect 
its way into the ventricular system through the ﬂoor of the third ventricle.

A median sagittal view of the brainstem and diencephalon (A) 
reveals the position of the oculomotor nerve (III) in relation to 
adjacent structures. The MRI in B and C show the position of the ocu-
lomotor nerve in sagittal (B, T1-weighted) and in axial (C, T2-weighted) 
planes. Note the relationship of the oculomotor nerve to the adjacent 
posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries (B, C). Also compare 
these images with that of Figure 3-2B on p. 47. In D (T2-weighted), the 
trochlear nerve is seen passing through the ambient cistern around the 
lateral aspect of the midbrain (compare with Figures 2-39 on p. 35 and 
5-15 on p. 91).
The oculomotor (III) and trochlear (IV) nerves are the cranial nerves 
of the midbrain. The third nerve exits via the interpeduncular fossa to 
3-3
innervate four major extraocular muscles (see Figure 8-19 on p. 226), 
and through the ciliary ganglion, the sphincter pupillae muscles. Dam-
age to the oculomotor nerve may result in paralysis of most eye move-
ment, a dilated pupil, and loss of the efferent limb of the pupillary light 
reﬂex, all in the ipsilateral eye. The fourth nerve is unique in that it is 
the only cranial nerve to exit the posterior (dorsal) aspect of the brain-
stem and is the only cranial nerve motor nucleus to innervate, exclu-
sively, a muscle on the contralateral side of the midline. Damage to the 
third and fourth nerves also results in diplopia.

The trigeminal nerve (V) is the largest of the cranial nerve roots of 
the brainstem (A). It exits at an intermediate position on the lat-
eral aspect of the pons roughly in line with CNs VII, IX, and X. The ﬁfth 
nerve and these latter three are mixed nerves in that they have motor and 
sensory components. The trigeminal nerve is shown in axial MRI (B, 
T1-weighted; C, T2-weighted) and coronal planes (D, E, both T1-weighted 
images). Note the characteristic appearance of the root of the trigeminal 
nerve as it traverses the subarachnoid space (B, C), origin of the trigeminal 
nerve, and position of the sensory root of the nerve at the lateral aspect of 
the pons in the coronal plane (D, E). In addition, the MRI in C clearly illus-
trates the position of the trigeminal ganglion in the middle cranial fossa.

Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is a lancinating paroxysmal 
pain within the V2 to V3 territories frequently triggered by stimuli 
around the corner of the mouth. The causes probably are multiple and 
may include neurovascular compression by aberrant branches of the 
superior cerebellar artery (see the apposition of this vessel to the nerve 
root in C), multiple sclerosis, tumors, and ephaptic transmission within 
the nerve or ganglion.
There are multiple medical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia; 
when these fail, surgical therapy may include peripheral nerve section 
or neurectomy, microvascular decompression, or percutaneous trigemi-
nal rhizotomy.

The cranial nerves at the pons–medulla junction are the abducens 
(VI), the facial (VII), and the vestibulocochlear (VIII) (A). The 
facial and vestibulocochlear nerves both enter the internal acoustic mea-
tus, the facial nerve distributing eventually to the face through the stylo-
mastoid foramen, and the vestibulocochlear nerve to structures of the 
inner ear. MRIs in the axial plane, B, C, D (all T2-weighted images) show 
the relationships of the vestibulocochlear root and the facial nerve to the 
internal acoustic meatus. Also notice the characteristic appearance of the 
cochlea (B, C) and the semicircular canals (B, C). In addition to these two 
cranial nerves, the labyrinthine branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar 
artery also enters the internal acoustic meatus and sends branches to 
serve the cochlea and semicircular canals and their respective ganglia.
3-5
The tumor commonly associated with the eighth nerve is correctly 
called a vestibular schwannoma because it arises from the neurilemma 
sheath of the vestibular root. It is not correct to refer to this as an acous-
tic neuroma; it is neither acoustic (does not arise for the cochlear root) 
nor a neuroma (does not arise from nerve tissue).
Most patients with this tumor have hearing loss, tinnitus, and equi-
librium problems, or vertigo. As the tumor enlarges (to more than 
about 2 cm) it may cause facial weakness (seventh root), numbness 
(ﬁfth root), or abnormal corneal reﬂex (ﬁfth or seventh root). Treat-
ment is usually by surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination 
thereof.

The glossopharyngeal (IX) and vagus (X) nerves (A) exit the 
lateral aspect of the medulla via the postolivary sulcus; the 
ninth nerve exits rostral to the row of rootlets comprising the tenth 
nerve (A). These nerves are generally in line with the exits of the facial 
and trigeminal nerves; all of these are mixed nerves. The exit of the 
glossopharyngeal nerve (A, B) is close to the pons–medulla junction and 
correlates with the corresponding shape (more rectangular) of the 
medulla. The vagus nerve exits at a slightly more caudal position (A, C, 
D); the shape of the medulla is more square and the fourth ventricle is 
smaller. The ninth and tenth cranial nerves and the spinal portion of the 
accessory nerve (XI) exit the skull via the jugular foramen.
Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a lancinating pain originating from 
the territories served by the ninth and tenth nerves at the base of the 
3-6
tongue and throat. Trigger events may include chewing and swallow-
ing. Lesions of nerves passing through the jugular foramen (IX, X, XI) 
may result in loss of the gag reﬂex (motor limb via ninth nerve), droop-
ing of the ipsilateral shoulder accompanied by an inability to turn the 
head to the opposite side against resistance (eleventh nerve), and dysar-
thria and dysphagia (tenth nerve). Syndromes of the jugular foramen 
may result from lesions/tumors located inside the cranial cavity adja-
cent to the foramen (as in the Vernet syndrome, roots of IX, X, XI), 
within the foramen itself, or external to the foramen at the skull base. 
In the latter case, the lesion may encompass the roots of the ninth, 
tenth, and eleventh nerves as well as the twelfth (the Collet-Sicard  
syndrome).

The hypoglossal nerve (XII) (A) exits the inferolateral aspect of 
the medulla via the preolivary sulcus. This cranial nerve exits in 
line with the abducens nerve found at the pons–medulla junction and in 
line with the exits of the third and fourth nerves of the midbrain. The 
twelfth nerve exit is characteristically located laterally adjacent to the 
pyramid, which contains corticospinal ﬁbers.
In axial MRI (B, T2-weighted; C, T1-weighted), note the character-
istic position of the hypoglossal nerve in the subarachnoid space and its 
relation to the overall shape of the medulla. This shape is indicative of a 
cranial nerve exiting at more mid-to-caudal medullary levels. In B, note 
its relationship to the preolivary sulcus and olivary eminence. The 
hypoglossal exits the base of the skull by traversing the hypoglossal 
canal. A lesion of the hypoglossal root, or in its peripheral distribution, 
will result in a deviation of the tongue to the side of the root damage on 
attempted protrusion; the genioglossus muscle on that side is paralyzed. 
A lesion in the medulla, such as a medial medullary syndrome (Déjèrine 
syndrome), can result in the same deviation of the tongue (to the side of 
the lesion on protrusion) plus additional motor (corticospinal) and sen-
sory (medial lemniscus) deﬁcits on the opposite side of the body.
3-7
The total picture of deﬁcits seen in medullary lesions that involve 
the hypoglossal nucleus, or nerve, or in posterior fossa lesions that 
involve the hypoglossal root and other roots, will depend on what 
additional structures are recruited into the lesion or are damaged. For 
example, syndromes of the jugular foramen commonly involve roots 
of cranial nerves (CNs) IX, X, and XI either together or in various 
combinations.
Recall that the jugular foramen (CNs IX, X, XI) and the hypoglossal 
canal (CN XII) are closely adjacent to each other, separated only by a 
small bar of bone on the inner aspect of the skull (see Figure 2-23 on 
p. 24). This separation may preclude an intracranial lesion from 
 damaging all of these roots simultaneously. However, the roots of CNs 
IX–XII come into close apposition immediately upon their exit from the 
skull base and may be collectively damaged by a lesion in this conﬁned 
area. Deﬁcits in the Collet-Sicard syndrome (one of the jugular foramen 
syndromes) reﬂect damage to CNs IX, X, XI, and XII.
These roots may be collectively damaged in a basal skull fracture 
involving both foramina or by a tumor involving these roots in a con-
ﬁned area.

Lesions (#1 to #5) of the abducens nerve and/or nucleus and of 
the medial longitudinal fasciculus that result in deﬁcits of eye 
movements in the horizontal plane.
Lesion of the abducens root (#1): Motor neurons in the abducens 
nucleus innervate the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle. Consequently, a 
patient with a lesion of the abducens root external to the pons (see Fig-
ure 3-5 for the position of the sixth root) experiences a loss of volun-
tary lateral gaze in the eye on the side of the lesion, indicating a 
paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle. Other movements in the affected 
eye, and all movements in the contralateral eye, are normal. This 
patient will experience diplopia. When looking straight ahead, the eye 
on the lesioned side will deviate slightly toward the midline (unopposed 
action of the medial rectus in the same eye) and the diplopia is made 
worse when attempting to look toward the lesioned side in a horizontal 
plane.
Caudal basilar pontine lesion (#2): As axons arising from abducens 
motor neurons pass through the basilar pons, they are located laterally 
adjacent to corticospinal ﬁbers (see Figure 6-19 on pp. 130–131).  
A lesion in this portion of the pons may simultaneously damage the 
exiting abducens ﬁbers and corticospinal axons. A patient with this 
lesion experiences an alternating (or crossed) hemiplegia, a paralysis of 
the lateral rectus muscle on the side of the lesion (loss of voluntary lat-
eral gaze to that side, and diplopia), and a paralysis of the upper and 
lower extremities on the opposite side of the body. Alternating, or 
crossed, deﬁcits are characteristic of brainstem lesions.
Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) (#3): In addition to abducens 
motor neurons that innervate the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle, the 
abducens nucleus also contains interneurons. The axons of these 
interneurons cross the midline, enter the medial longitudinal fasciculus 
(MLF), and ascend to terminate on motor neurons in the oculomotor 
3-8
nucleus that innervate the medial rectus muscle on that side. A lesion in 
the MLF interrupts these axons and results in a loss of medial gaze 
(medial rectus paralysis) in the eye on the side of the lesion during 
attempted conjugate eye movements. Other movements in the affected 
eye and all movements in the contralateral eye are normal. The lateral-
ity of the deﬁcit reﬂects the side of the lesion and of the deﬁcit. For 
example, a right internuclear ophthalmoplegia speciﬁes a lesion in the 
right MLF and paralysis of the right medial rectus muscle; a left inter-
nuclear ophthalmoplegia indicates a lesion in the left MLF and left 
medial rectus weakness.
Lesion of the abducens nucleus (#4): A lesion of the abducens 
nucleus damages alpha motor neurons innervating the ipsilateral lateral 
rectus muscle and the interneurons that terminate on medial rectus 
alpha motor neurons residing in the contralateral oculomotor nucleus. 
A patient with this lesion experiences a loss of horizontal gaze in both 
eyes during attempted voluntary eye movement toward the side of the 
lesion; horizontal gaze toward the contralateral side is normal. This is 
basically an abducens root lesion plus an INO.
The one-and-a-half syndrome (#5): This syndrome is so named 
because a unilateral pontine lesion may result in a loss of medial and 
lateral voluntary eye movement on the side of the lesion (the “one”) 
and a loss of medial horizontal eye movement on the contralateral side 
(the “one-half”). The lesion resulting in this pattern of deﬁcits involves 
the abducens nucleus on one side (deﬁcits = lateral rectus paralysis  
on the side of the lesion, medial rectus paralysis on the contralateral 
side) and the immediately adjacent MLF conveying the axons of abdu-
cens interneurons originating in the opposite abducens nucleus (deﬁcit 
= medial rectus paralysis on the side of the lesion). These lesions are 
usually large and involve portions of the paramedian pontine reticular 
formation, commonly called the horizontal gaze center.

*According to Wolf (1971) in his excellent book describing brainstem syndromes from their original sources, Fulgence Raymond described a female patient, with several medical 
 complications, with right hemiparesis and left abducens palsy. Raymond localized the probable lesion (he acknowledged more than one potential cause) to the basilar pons involving 
corticospinal ﬁbers and the abducens root. This is also commonly called the Foville syndrome, although Foville is also described as recruiting adjacent structures with their corresponding 
deﬁcits. Both eponyms are acceptable.

Cranial Nerve Cross Reference
55
Cranial Nerves in Their Larger Functional/Clinical Context (Figures 3-9 to 3-15)
Cranial nerves are usually an integral part of any neurological exami-
nation; this is certainly the case in injuries and/or diseases that involve 
the head and neck. This chapter details their exit points (or, one could 
argue, the entrance points in the case of sensory nerves), their corre-
sponding appearance in MRI, and examples of lesions causing deﬁcits 
of eye movements in the horizontal plane and of brainstem lesions that 
include cranial nerve deﬁcits.
This is, however, only part of a much larger picture that places cranial 
nerves in a functional context and views their connections in the periph-
ery as well as within the central nervous system. Although these more 
comprehensive cranial nerve connections, and their corresponding func-
tions, are illustrated in Chapter 8 in their appropriate systems context, 
they are brieﬂy listed here to facilitate cross reference for those users wish-
ing to consider cranial nerves in a more integrated format at this point.
The columns of cells within the spinal cord are rostrally con-
tinuous with comparable cell columns in the brainstem that 
have similar functions. For example, general motor cell columns of the 
spinal cord are continuous with the groups of motor nuclei that inner-
vate the tongue and the extraocular muscles; both cell columns inner-
vate skeletal muscles. The same is the case for general sensation. Nuclei 
conveying special senses are found only in the brainstem and are associ-
ated with only certain cranial nerves.
3-9
Functional Components of Spinal and Cranial Nerves 
(see also Figures 6-1 and 6-2 on pp. 96–97)
The trigeminal nerve conveys sensory input from the face and 
oral cavity and provides motor innervation to the muscles of 
mastication. The spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus also receive general 
sensation via CNs VII, IX, and X. In this respect, the spinal trigeminal 
tract is the center for all general sensory sensations entering the brain-
stem on all cranial nerves. In the same sense, the solitary tract and 
nucleus (Figure 8-9 on pp. 206–207) is the brainstem center for all vis-
ceral sensation that enters the brainstem on CNs VII, IX, and X. Both 
of these cranial nerve brainstem nuclei convey information to the thala-
mus and eventually to the cerebral cortex.

Trigeminal Pathways and Deficits (see also  
Figures 8-7 and 8-8A, B on pp. 202–205)
The cerebral cortex inﬂuences cranial nerve nuclei via corti-
conuclear ﬁbers. In the neurological examination, this is most 
evident when testing motor functions of CNs VII, IX, X, XI, and XII. In 
many situations, the deﬁcit is seen by the inability of the patient to per-
form a movement “against resistance.” Comparing the deﬁcit(s) of a 
lesion of these ﬁbers to damage of cranial nerves within the brainstem, 
or the periphery, is essential to localizing the lesion within the central 
nervous system.

3: Cranial Nerves
Cranial nerve nuclei are either motor to skeletal muscle or 
visceromotor to ganglia in the periphery. Lesions involving 
the nuclei, or roots, of motor nuclei result in paralysis of the muscles 
served, with the predictable deﬁcits, such as weakness of the facial mus-
cles or deviation of the tongue on protrusion. Lesions that damage the 
visceromotor ﬁbers of a cranial nerve result in an expected visceromo-
tor response, such as dilation of the pupil, or a decrease in secretory 
function or smooth muscle motility.

Cranial Nerve Efferents (III–VII and IX–XII) and Deficits 
(see also Figures 8-19 to 8-22B on pp. 226–233)
Testing cranial nerve reﬂexes is a routine part of any com-
plete neurological examination. This part of the neurological 
exam tests the integrity of the afferent and efferent limbs of the reﬂex. 
Sometimes both of these are on the same cranial nerve; sometimes they 
are on different cranial nerves. In addition, deﬁcits may be seen that 
reﬂect damage affecting cranial nerve function, but this damage is not 
in the afferent or efferent limbs of the reﬂex; this suggests a broader 
problem within the central nervous system.
3-13
Cranial Nerve Reflex Pathways and Deficits  
(see also Figures 8-23 to 8-32 on pp. 234–240)
The pupillary reﬂex (commonly called the pupillary light 
reﬂex) has its afferent limb via the second cranial nerve and 
its efferent limb via the third cranial nerve. The reaction of the pupil 
when light is shined in one eye is a clear hint as to the location of the 
lesion. The optic nerve, chiasm, tract, and radiations and the visual cor-
tex have a retinotopic representation throughout. Lesions of any of 
these structures result in visual deﬁcits, such as a hemianopia or quad-
rantanopia, that reﬂect the particular portion of the visual system that 
is damaged. Because visual pathways are widespread within the brain, 
lesions at various different locations may result in visual deﬁcits.
3-14
Pupillary and Visual Pathways and Deficits  
(see also Figures 8-44 to 8-47B on pp. 262–267)
The auditory portion of the eighth cranial nerve is concerned 
with the perception of sound. Damage to the cochlea itself, or 
the cochlear root, may profoundly alter one’s perception of sound or 
may result in deafness. The vestibular portion of the eighth cranial 
nerve functions in the arena of balance, equilibrium, and maintenance 
of posture. Damage to the semicircular canals, to the vestibular root, or 
to central structures that receive vestibular input, may result in vertigo, 
ataxia, difﬁculty walking or maintaining balance, and/or a variety of 
eye movement problems.

4: Meninges, Cisterns, Ventricles, and Related Hemorrhages—The Meninges and Meningeal and Brain Hemorrhages
Meningitis, Meningeal Hemorrhages,  
and Meningiomas
A wide variety of disease processes and lesions may involve the menin-
ges; only a few examples are mentioned here.
Infections of the meninges (bacterial meningitis) may be called lep-
tomeningitis because the causative organisms localize to the subarach-
noid space and involve the pia and arachnoid. Extension into the dura is 
called pachymeningitis. A variety of organisms cause bacterial meningi-
tis; those most commonly associated with certain groups are as follows: 
neonate = Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocy-
togenes; neonate to about 24 months = S. agalactiae, E. coli, Haemo-
philus inﬂuenzae; about 2 to 50 years = Streptococcus pneumoniae,  
Neisseria meningitidis; about 50 years + = S. pneumoniae, N. meningi-
tidis, L. monocytogenes; basal skull fracture = S. pneumoniae, H. inﬂu-
enzae; head trauma = Staphylococcus. The patient becomes acutely ill 
(i.e., headache, confusion, fever, stiff neck [meningismus], stupor), may 
have generalized or focal signs/symptoms, and, if not rapidly treated 
(with appropriate antibiotics), will likely die. Patients with viral menin-
gitis may become ill over a period of several days, experience headache, 
confusion, and fever, but, with supportive care, will usually recover after 
an acute phase of about 1 to 2 weeks with no permanent deﬁcits.
The most common cause of an epidural (extradural) hematoma is a 
skull fracture that results in a laceration of a major dural vessel, such 
as the middle meningeal artery. In approximately 15% of cases, bleed-
ing may come from a venous sinus. The extravasated blood dissects 
the dura mater off the inner table of the skull; there is no pre-existing 
cerebral extradural space for the blood to enter. These lesions are fre-
quently large, lens (lenticular) shaped, may appear loculated, and are 
“short and thick” compared with subdural hematomas (see Figure 4-4 
on p. 62). The fact that epidural hematomas do not cross suture lines 
correlates with their characteristic shape. The patient may lapse into a 
coma and, if the lesion is left untreated, death may result. In some cases, 
the patient may be unconscious initially, followed by a lucid interval 
(the patient is wide awake), then subsequently deteriorate rapidly and 
die; this is called “talk and die.” Treatment of choice for large lesions 
is surgical removal of the clot and coagulation of the damaged vessel.
Tearing of bridging veins (veins passing from the brain outward 
through the arachnoid and dura), usually the result of trauma, is a 
common cause of subdural hematoma. This designation is somewhat 
a misnomer because the extravasated blood actually dissects through a

specialized, yet structurally weak, cell layer at the dura–arachnoid inter-
face; this is the dural border cell layer. There is no pre-existing “sub-
dural space” in the normal brain. Acute subdural hematomas, more 
commonly seen in younger patients, usually are detected immediately

hematomas, usually seen in the elderly, or in patients on anticoagula-
tion therapy, are frequently of unknown origin. They may take days or 
weeks to become symptomatic and, in the process, cause a progressive 
change in the mental status of the patient. This lesion appears “long and 
thin” compared with an epidural hematoma, follows the surface of the 
brain, and may extend for considerable distances (see Figures 4-4 on 
p. 62 and 4-5 on p. 63). Treatment is surgical evacuation (for larger or 
acute lesions) or close monitoring for small, asymptomatic, or chronic 
lesions.
The most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage is trauma. 
In approximately 75% to 80% of patients with spontaneous (nontrau-
matic) subarachnoid hemorrhage, the precipitating event is rupture of

malformation occurs in approximately 5% of cases. Blood collects in 
and percolates through the subarachnoid space and cisterns (see Figure 
{ÇÊÊ«°ÊÈx®°Ê-iÌiÃ]ÊÌiÊ`iwVÌÃÊÃiiÊ­>ÃÃÕ}ÊÌiÊ«>ÌiÌÊÃÊÌÊ
in a coma) may be a clue as to location, especially if cranial nerves are 
nearby. Onset is sudden; the patient complains of a sudden and excru-
ciatingly painful headache (“the worst of my life,” “thunderclap,” “felt 
like my head exploded”) and may remain conscious, become lethargic 
and disoriented, or may be comatose. Treatment of an aneurysm is to 
surgically separate the sac of the aneurysm from the parent vessel (by 
clip or coil), if possible, and protect against the development of vasos-
pasm. During surgery, some blood in the subarachnoid space and cis-
terns may be removed.
Tumors of the meninges (meningiomas) are classiﬁed in different 
ways, but usually they arise from arachnoid cap/stem cells (a small 
number are dural in origin) around the villi or at places where vessels or 
cranial nerves penetrate the dura–arachnoid. These tumors may present 
with seizure, grow slowly (symptoms may develop almost impercepti-
bly over years), are histologically benign, may result in hyperostosis of 
the overlying skull, and frequently contain calciﬁcations. In decreasing 
order, meningiomas are found in the following locations: parasagittal 
area + falx cerebri (together 29%), convexity 15%, sella 13%, sphe-
noid ridge 12%, and olfactory groove 10%. Treatment is primarily by 
surgical removal, although some meningiomas are treated by radio-
therapy.

via the medial foramen of Magendie and the two lateral foramina of

surface of the dura. There is no actual or potential subdural space. 
This space is created resultant to a traumatic, infectious, or patho-
logic process.

The treatment of choice for epidural hematoma, especially if the 
patient is symptomatic, or if the patient is asymptomatic but the acute 
lesion is greater than 1 cm thick at its widest point and has a volume of 
greater than 30 cm3, is surgical removal and hemostasis of bleeders. In 
subdural hematoma, surgical evacuation is the preferred treatment in 
symptomatic patients with acute lesions that are 1 cm thick (0.5  
in pediatric patients) and a midline shift of greater than 5 mm. On the 
other hand, asymptomatic patients with thin subdural lesions may be 
followed medically and may not require surgery.

Epidural hematoma may occur in cases of skull fracture (A, on the 
right side) in which the middle meningeal artery (or its larger branches) 
is lacerated. The resulting hematoma is formed between the inner table 
of the skull and the outer aspect of the dura (epidural, B, on the right). 
In this signiﬁcant trauma, there is a large epidural, a small lesion, prob-
ably also an epidural (small arrows), and small amounts or air within 
the cranial cavity (B, black dots).
The mechanism of epidural hematoma formation is most likely two-
fold. First, the dura is stripped from the inner table of the skull during

edges of bone lacerate arteries, which bleed into this space, and, it is 
believed, may further dissect the dura from the skull. Epidural hemato-
mas do not cross suture lines.

hemorrhage/hematoma; in such cases, it is called acute subdural hematoma

the right side of the head (C, soft tissue damage at arrows) resulted in a 
large acute subdural hematoma on the patient’s right side, and trauma on

As seen in B and C in this ﬁgure, and in Figure 4-4A and D on the

result in effacement of the midline as indicated by a shift in the position 
of the falx cerebri. This appearance, plus the frequent loss of sulci and 
sometimes cisterns on the side of the lesion, foretells the very real pos-
sibility of brain herniation. This may present as a subfalcine herniation, 
which may impinge on both hemispheres, or morph into a transtento-

lamina terminalis cistern (containing blood) and the third ventricle 
(devoid of blood) represents the position of the lamina terminalis. In D, 
blood is located in cisterns around the pons, but avoids the rostral part 
4-7
of the fourth ventricle. Also note the clearly enlarged temporal horn of 
the lateral ventricle in D; enlargement of this particular part of the ven-
tricle is indicative of increased pressure within the ventricular system.

Examples of a right-sided convexity meningioma (A, B) and a 
meningioma of the tentorium cerebelli (C, D). Meningiomas are 
slow growing, usually benign extra-axial tumors that are curable 
assuming they can be completely removed (91%+, 5-year survival). 
They may present with headache or seizure, but many are asympto-
matic and some are discovered as an incidental ﬁnding. The convexity 
meningioma (A, sagittal; B, coronal) is located in the medial aspect of 
the superior frontal gyrus rostral to the paracentral gyri. It is slightly off 
the midline; meningiomas that are directly adjacent to the midline and 
involve the superior sagittal sinus are called parasagittal meningiomas.

ÛiÝÌÞÊi-
ingiomas are seen in about 15% of cases, and parasagittal meningiomas 
are found in about 21% of patients.
The tentorial meningioma (C, sagittal; D, coronal) is located on the 
midline, close to the rostral edge of the tentorium, and on its inferior 
surface. The tumor signiﬁcantly impinges on the cerebellum (C, D), but 
does not involve the occipital lobes. This patient has motor deﬁcits of the 
cerebellar type due to the involvement of the cerebellum. Due to its loca-
tion, this tumor presents a greater surgical challenge than does the con-
vexity meningioma and may contribute to eventual occlusion of the 
cerebral aqueduct. Tentorial meningiomas are seen in 3% to 4% of cases.

hemisphere, such as large veins and the corpus callosum (G = genu, B = 
L`Þ]Ê-Ê= splenium), are in their normal positions. Tumors are seen in 
this area in about 10% to 12% of cases and may require special surgi-
cal approaches.

that the central portions of the hemisphere have been pushed caudally 
4-9
as seen by the foreshortened internal cerebral vein and the change in 
shape and position of the corpus callosum(G =Ê}iÕ]Ê-Ê= splenium). At 
the same time, olfactory groove meningiomas are also seen in this loca-
tion and have a similar appearance. These arise from the area of the 
cribriform plate and enlarge upward to impinge on the frontal lobes. 
Falcine meningiomas constitute about 8% and olfactory groove menin-
giomas about 10% of all tumors of this type.
The general appearance of these examples, and those in Figure 4-8 
(facing page), illustrate that these lesions, in many cases, grow so slowly 
that a signiﬁcant portion of the brain can be displaced without unto-
ward effects. The presenting deﬁcits may be persistent headache and 
seizure. The sulci and midline may not be effaced and brain structures 
may not be displaced from their normal position. However, meningi-

The presence of blood within the ventricular system occurs in about 
25% of cases with ruptured aneurysm. The most common aneurysm 
sites, and point at which blood may enter the ventricular system upon 
rupture, are as follows: the distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery, 
through the roof of the fourth ventricle or foramen of Luschka (fourth

damage and skull fractures (especially in patients A and B). In patient A, 
 there is blood in the right anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. Patient 
B has blood in the right anterior horn, in the third ventricle, in the sub-
stance of the brain in the right frontal lobe as well as a small epidural at 
the right frontal pole. Patient C has blood in the third ventricle and in 
the atrium of the lateral ventricle on the right side. In addition to 
trauma, as illustrated here, intraventricular hemorrhage (also called 
intraventricular blood) may occur in a variety of situations. Intracere-
bral hemorrhage, a bleed into the substance of the brain (also called 
parenchymatous hemorrhage), may extend into a ventricular space, 
bleeding from a brain tumor, arteriovenous malformation, or from a 
4-13
tumor of the choroid plexus. In addition, blood from a ruptured aneu-
rysm may preferentially dissect into adjacent ventricular spaces as 
described in Figure 4-12. Intraventricular blood may also occur in new-
borns who have bleeding internal to the ependymal lining of the ventri-
cle (subependymal hemorrhage) that extends into the ventricle, in a 
patient of any age who may bleed from an arteriovenous malformation, 
or from a highly vascular tumor of the choroid plexus within the ven-
tricular space. As a general principle, the larger the ventricles become, in 
cases of intraventricular blood, the worse the prognosis for the patient.
These images illustrate the important fact that, especially in patients 
with head trauma, blood may be found at different locations (menin-
geal, intraventricular, within the substance of the brain [parenchyma-
tous]) in the same patient. Ê>}iÃÊ>ÀiÊ>Ý>Ê

The presence of blood within the substance of the brain may 
be called parenchymatous hemorrhage (a more general and 
global term), or cerebral hemorrhage (hemorrhage into the cerebral 
hemisphere), brainstem hemorrhage (hemorrhage into the brainstem), 
pontine hemorrhage (hemorrhage into the pons), or by any of a number 
of other terms that indicate a more speciﬁc location and size (Duret 
hemorrhage), shape (splinter hemorrhage), or extent of the extrava-
sated blood. The large hemorrhages into the hemisphere (A, B) have 
resulted in enlargement of the ventricles, a midline shift (with the real 
possibility of brain herniation), and, in the case of A, a small amount of 
blood in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. In these examples, 
the lesion is most likely a result of hemorrhage from lenticulostriate 
branches of the M1 segment.

Blood in the substance of the brain and in the ventricular system 
may also result from trauma (C). In this example (C), blood is seen in 
the frontal lobe and in the third ventricle and cerebral aqueduct. The 
enlarged temporal horns (C) of the lateral ventricles are consistent with

Other causes of blood within the brain include bleeding from a vari-
ety of tumors, more commonly from malignant tumors and metastatic 
tumors and less so from benign tumors. Traumatic injury, commonly 
referred to as traumatic brain injury (TBI), may be a source of blood 
within the brain as well as the transformation of an ischemic stroke into 
a hemorrhagic stroke.

Internal Morphology of the 
Brain in Unstained Slices 
and MRI
rientation to Coronal MRIs: When looking at a coronal MRI, 
you are viewing the image as if you are looking at the face of 
the patient. Consequently, the observer’s right is the left side of 
the brain in the MRI and the left side of the patient’s brain. Conversely, 
the observer’s left is the right side of the brain in the MRI and the right 
side of the patient’s brain. Obviously, the concept of what is the left side 
versus what is the right side of the patient’s brain is enormously impor-
tant when using MRI (or CT) to diagnose a neurologically impaired  
individual.
To reinforce this concept, the rostral surface of each coronal brain 
slice appears in each photograph. So, when looking at the slice, the 
observer’s right ﬁeld of view is the left side of the brain slice, and the 
observer’s left ﬁeld of view is the right side of the brain slice. This view 
of the slice correlates exactly with the orientation of the brain as seen in 
the accompanying coronal MRIs.
Orientation to Axial MRIs: When looking at an axial MRI, you are 
viewing the image as if standing at the patient’s feet and looking toward 
his or her head while the patient is lying on his or her back. Consequently, 
and as is the case in coronal images, the observer’s right is the left side of 
the brain in the MRI and the left side of the patient’s brain. It is absolutely 
essential to have a clear understanding of this right-versus-left concept when 
using MRI (or CT) in the diagnosis of the neurologically impaired patient.
To reinforce this concept, the ventral surface of each axial slice was 
photographed. So, when looking at the slice, the observer’s right is the 
left side of the brain slice. This view of the slice correlates exactly with 
the orientation of the brain as seen in the accompanying axial MRIs.

The rostral surface of a coronal section of brain through the 
level of the anterior tubercle of the thalamus and the column of 
the fornix just caudal to the anterior commissure. A level that includes 
these structures also passes through the genu of the internal capsule. 
This section also includes the two portions of the globus pallidus: a 
medial or internal segment and a lateral or external segment. The termi-
nal vein is also called the superior thalamostriate vein. The two MRIs 
(both are inversion recovery) are at the same plane and show many of 
the structures identiﬁed in the brain slice.

The hippocampus is located in the ventromedial aspect of the tem-
poral horn of the lateral ventricle and appears to have texture in MRI 
representing its alternating layers of cell bodies and ﬁbers (see Figure 
5-4 on the facing page). On the other hand, the amygdaloid nucleus is 
located in the rostral end of the temporal horn and appears very homog-
enous in MRI (see above). An easy way to recall these relationships 
is: ventricular space + texture = hippocampus, whereas no ventricular 
space + homogenous appearance = amygdala. Based on the coronal 
plane, the transition from one to the other may take place quickly.

This slice beautifully illustrates that ﬁbers within the internal capsule 
(posterior limb in this slice) traverse the crus cerebri and enter 
5-5
the basilar pons (MRI and brain slice); these within the crus are the 
corticospinal, corticopontine (parieto-, occipito-, temporo-, and fron-
topontine), and the corticonuclear ﬁbers. The two MRIs (both are 
inversion recovery) are at the same plane and show many of the struc-

Internal Morphology of the 
Brain in Unstained Slices

rientation to Axial MRIs: When looking at an axial MRI, you 
are viewing the image as if standing at the patient’s feet and 
looking toward his or her head while the patient is lying on 
his or her back. Consequently, and as is the case in coronal images, the 
observer’s right is the left side of the brain in the MRI and the left side of 
the patient’s brain, and the observer’s left is the right side of the brain in 
MRI and the right side of the patient’s brain. It is absolutely essential to 
have a clear understanding of this right-versus-left concept when using 
MRI or CT in the diagnosis of the neurologically impaired patient.
To reinforce this concept, the ventral surface of each axial slice was 
photographed. So, when looking at the slice, the observer’s right is the 
left side of the brain slice, and the observer’s left is the right side of the 
brain slice. This view of the slice correlates exactly with the orientation 
of the brain as seen in the accompanying axial MRIs.

Internal Morphology of  
the Spinal Cord and Brain: 
Functional Components, 
MRI, Stained Sections
asic concepts that are essential when one is initially learning 
how to diagnose the neurologically impaired patient include: 
1) an understanding of cranial nerve nuclei and 2) how these 
structures relate to long tracts. The importance of these relationships 
is clearly seen in the combinations of deﬁcits that generally character-
ize lesions at different levels of the neuraxis. First, deﬁcits of the body 
only, excluding the head, that may present as motor or sensory losses 
(long tracts) on the same side, or opposite sides, are indicative of spi-
nal cord lesions (e.g., Brown-Séquard syndrome). Spinal cord injuries 
characteristically have motor and sensory levels; these are the lowest 
functional levels remaining in the compromised patient. Second, cra-
nial nerve deﬁcits (on one side of the head) in combination with long 
tract signs (on the opposite side of the body) characterize lesions in 
the brainstem (e.g., lateral medullary and Weber syndromes). These 
patterns of loss are frequently called alternating or crossed deﬁcits. In 
these examples, cranial nerve signs are better localizing signs than are 
long tract signs. A localizing sign can be deﬁned as an objective neuro-
logic abnormality that correlates with a lesion (or lesions) at a speciﬁc 
neuroanatomical location (or locations). Third, motor and sensory 
deﬁcits on the same side of the head and body are usually indicative of 
a lesion in the forebrain.
Color-Coded Spinal and Cranial Nerve 
Nuclei and Long Tracts
Spinal and cranial nerve motor nuclei are coded by their function; those 
innervating skeletal muscle (somatic efferent) are salmon/dark pink, and 
preganglionic visceral motor nuclei are rust. Similarly, the primary sensory 
nuclei of the spinal cord and brainstem that receive somatic afferent sen-
sation are light pink, and those receiving visceral afferents are purple. 
For example, one can easily correlate damage to the hypoglossal nerve 
root and the corticospinal ﬁbers on one side, while comparing this pat-
tern to a lateral medullary syndrome on the other side.
Long tracts are color coded beginning at the most caudal spinal cord 
levels (e.g., see Figures 6-3 and 6-4), with these colors extending into 
the dorsal thalamus (see Figure 6-33) and the posterior limb of the inter-
nal capsule (see Figures 6-34 and 6-35). The colorized spinal tracts are 
the fasciculus gracilis (dark blue), the fasciculus cuneatus (light blue),* 
the anterolateral system (dark green), and the lateral corticospinal tract 
(gray). In the brainstem, these spinal tracts are joined by the spinal 
trigeminal tract and ventral trigeminothalamic ﬁbers (both are light 
green). The long tracts are color coded on one side only, to emphasize: 1)  
laterality of function and dysfunction; 2) points at which ﬁbers in these 
tracts may decussate; and 3) the relationship of these tracts to cranial 
nerves.
Each set of facing pages (line drawing/stained section) through spinal 
and brainstem parts of this chapter feature a version of the overview of 
motor and sensory nuclei (or cell columns) next to the stained section. 
The line on this view, and the few labels, speciﬁcally identify the sensory 
and motor nuclei at that particular level, and the color code matches 
that on the line drawing. This allows the user to easily identify the rela-
tionships and continuity of functionally related cell columns at any level.
A color key appears on each page. This key identiﬁes the various 
tracts and nuclei by their color and speciﬁes the function of each struc-
ture on each page.
Correlation of MRI and CT with Internal 
Spinal Cord and Brainstem Anatomy
As one is learning basic anatomical concepts, it is absolutely essential to 
understand how this information is used in the clinical environment. To 
show the relationship between basic anatomy and how MRI (T1- and 
T2-weighted) and CT (myelogram/cisternogram) are viewed, a series of 
self-explanatory illustrations is provided on each set of facing pages in 
the spinal cord and brainstem sections of this chapter. This continuum 
of visual information consists of: 1) a small version of the colorized 
line drawing in an Anatomical Orientation; 2) a top-to-bottom ﬂip 
that brings the same image into a Clinical Orientation; and 3) a CT 
(spinal cord) or MRI and CT (brainstem) that follows this clinically 
oriented image. To further enhance the seamless application of basic 
neuroscience to clinical images (and to do so in their proper context), 
especially important anatomical structures are outlined, in white, on 
CT (spinal cord) and on the T1-weighted MRI (brainstem) images. This 
allows the user to understand where these anatomical structures are 
located in clinical images as viewed in the Clinical Orientation. One 
essential aspect of diagnosis is developing the ability to visualize what 
structures are involved in brainstem lesions and how the patient’s deﬁ-
cits correlate with the location and extent of the lesion. In addition, the 
“ﬂip symbol” at the lower left of each page indicates which anatomical 
images may be ﬂipped to a clinical orientation (labels on or off) using 
online resources available with the atlas.
Every effort is made to identify and use MRI and CT that correlate, 
as closely as possible, with their corresponding line drawing and stained 
section. This approach recognizes and retains the strength of the ana-
tomical approach and introduces essential clinical concepts while at the 
same time allowing the user to customize the material to suit a range of 
educational applications.

and upper portions of the body, respectively.

Spinal cord
The concept of functional components (of both spinal and cra-
nial nerves) recognizes that primary afferent ﬁbers entering, and 
the efferent ﬁbers leaving, the spinal cord or brainstem convey speciﬁc 
types of information. There are two versions of functional components: 
1) a traditional version that originated early in the 20th century and 
was the standard for many decades and 2) a contemporary version that 
reﬂects recent discoveries in head, neck, and brain development. Either 
of these plans can be used as they are complementary, one to the other.
Traditional version: In this version (Figures 6-1 and 6-2), the compo-
nents seen in the developing neural tube (left), that are associated with 
the alar plate (GSA, GVA), are located posterior to the sulcus limitans 
(SL); those associated with the basal plate (GVE, GSE) are located ante-
rior to the SL (Figure 6-1, left). These are general features also seen in 
the contemporary version. In the adult spinal cord, this general poste-
rior/anterior relationship is maintained (Figure 6-1, lower center).
At the spinal cord–brainstem transition, two important changes 
occur. First, as the central canal enlarges into the fourth ventricle, and 
the cerebellum develops, the alar portion of the neural tube is rotated 
laterally. The SL is present in the adult brainstem and separates the 
medially located basal plate derivatives (motor nuclei) from the later-
ally located alar plate derivatives (sensory nuclei). Second, in the brain-
stem, special functional components, as traditionally identiﬁed (SVE to 
muscles of the pharyngeal arches; SVA to taste; SSA to vestibular and 
auditory), form cell columns that are restricted to the brainstem and not 
represented in the spinal cord.
Within the brainstem, there are transpositions of the SVE and GSA 
components. Early in development, cells associated with the SVE com-
ponent (nucleus ambiguus, facial and trigeminal motor nuclei) appear 
6-1
in the ﬂoor of the ventricle, but then migrate ventrolaterally to their 
adult locations. In like manner, cells with the GSA component (spinal 
trigeminal, principal sensory) that appear in the ventricular ﬂoor in 
the alar area also migrate ventrolaterally to their adult locations. Cells 
of the mesencephalic nucleus arise from the neural crest and migrate 
into the brainstem to become part of the GSA cell column. The border 
between motor and sensory areas of the brainstem is represented by 
an oblique line beginning at the SL. The relative positions, and color 
coding, of the various components shown in the above image (right) is 
directly translatable to Figure 6-2 on the facing page.
Contemporary version: This version (Figure 6-1, right), as was the 
traditional version, is based on development, but incorporates more 
detailed data concerning neuron and muscle origin and their respective 
migration patterns. For example, striated muscles innervated by cranial 
nerves (CNs) III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, and XII all arise from the epimere 
(paraxial mesoderm), which segments into somitomeres. Consequently, 
the cells of all of these motor nuclei are designated as an SE (Somatic 
Efferent) functional component. The neurons of CN III that inﬂuence 
orbital smooth muscles, the cells of CNs VII and IX which inﬂuence 
vascular smooth muscle and glandular epithelium in the head, and cells 
of CN X that inﬂuence the same tissues in the thorax and abdomen, are 
all designated as VE (Visceral Efferent). All visceral afferent information 
(traditionally divided into General and Special) is associated with the 
solitary tract and nuclei and is designated VA (Visceral Afferent). The 
components traditionally associated with the vestibulocochlear nuclei 
(SSA) and with the trigeminal sensory nuclei (GSA) are consolidated 
into an SA (Somatic Afferent) category. The correlation between the 
traditional and contemporary versions is shown in Figure 6-1, far right.

The medial-to-lateral positions of brainstem cranial nerve and spi-
nal cord nuclei as shown here are the same as in Figure 6-1. This 
diagrammatic posterior (dorsal) view shows: 1) the relative positions and 
names of speciﬁc cell groups and their associated functional components; 
2) the approximate location of particular nuclei in their speciﬁc division of 
brainstem and/or spinal cord; and 3) the rostrocaudal continuity of cell 
6-2
columns (either as continuous or discontinuous cell groups) from one divi-
sion of the brainstem to the next or from brainstem to spinal cord. The 
nucleus ambiguus is a column of cells composed of distinct cell clusters 
interspersed with more diffusely arranged cells, much like a string of 
beads. Nuclei associated with CNs I and II are not shown. The color cod-
ing used on this ﬁgure correlates with that on Figure 6-1 (facing page).

Transverse section of the spinal cord showing the characteristics of a sacral 
level. The gray matter occupies most of the cross-section; its H-shaped appear-
ance is not especially obvious at sacral–coccygeal levels. The white matter is a compara-

Note the appearance of the sacral spinal cord surrounded by the upper portion of the cauda 
equina (left) and the cauda equina as it appears caudal to the conus medullaris in the lum-

Hyperextension of the neck may cause damage to the vertebral arteries (origin of the anterior 
spinal artery), or it may directly damage the anterior spinal artery, causing a spasm. This vascu-
lar damage leads to a temporary or permanent interruption of blood supply. Deﬁcits may resolve 
within a few hours or may be permanent, depending on the extent of vascular complication. 
Sparing of the posterior columns (proprioception, vibratory sense) is a hallmark; approximately 
the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord is ischemic.
Thrombosis of Anterior Spinal Artery
This may occur in a hypotensive crisis, as a result of trauma resulting from a dissecting aortic 
aneurysm, or in patients with atherosclerosis. It may occur at all spinal levels, but is more fre-
quently seen in thoracic and lumbosacral levels unless trauma is the primary cause. Results are 
bilateral ﬂaccid paraplegia (if the lesion is below cervical levels) or quadriplegia (if the lesion is 
in cervical levels), urinary retention, and loss of pain and temperature sensation. Flaccid muscles 
may become spastic over a period of a day to weeks, with hyperactive muscle stretch reﬂexes and 
extensor plantar (Babinski) reﬂexes. In addition, lesions at high cervical levels may also result in 
paralysis of respiratory muscles. The artery of Adamkiewicz (a large spinal medullary artery) is 
usually located at spinal levels T12–L1 and more frequently arises on the left side. Occlusion of 
this vessel may infarct lumbosacral levels of the spinal cord.
Hemorrhage in the Spinal Cord
This is rarely seen, but may result from trauma or bleeding from congenital vascular lesions. 
Symptoms may develop rapidly or gradually in stepwise fashion, and blood is usually present in 
the cerebrospinal ﬂuid.
Arteriovenous Malformation in the Spinal Cord
More frequently found in lower cord levels. Symptoms of a spinal AVM (micturition prob-
lems are seen early, motor deﬁcits, lower back pain) may appear over time and may seem to 
resolve then recur (get better, then worse). These lesions are usually found external to the cord 
(extramedullary) and can be surgically treated, especially when the major feeding vessels are few 
in number and easily identiﬁed. Foix-Alajouanine syndrome is an inﬂammation of spinal veins, 
with subsequent occlusion that results in infarct of the spinal cord and a necrotic myelitis. The 
symptoms are ascending pain and a ﬂaccid paralysis.

Brown-Séquard Syndrome
This syndrome is a hemisection (functional hemisection) of the spinal cord that may result from 
trauma, compression of the spinal cord by tumors or hematomas, or signiﬁcant protrusion of an 
intervertebral disc. The deﬁcits depend on the level of the causative lesion. The classic signs are: 1) a 
loss of pain and thermal sensation on the contralateral side of the body beginning about one to two 
segments below the level of the lesion (damage to anterolateral system ﬁbers); 2) a loss of discrimi-
native touch and proprioception on the ipsilateral side of the body below the lesion (interruption of 
posterior column ﬁbers); and 3) a paralysis on the ipsilateral side of the body below the lesion (dam-
age to lateral corticospinal ﬁbers). This syndrome is classiﬁed as an incomplete spinal cord injury, 
and patients with this lesion may regain some degree of motor and sensory function. Compression 
of the spinal cord may result in some, but not all, of the signs and symptoms of the syndrome.
Syringomyelia
Syringomyelia is a cavitation within the central region of the spinal cord. A cavitation of the 
central canal with an ependymal cell lining is hydromyelia. A syrinx may originate in central 
portions of the spinal cord, may communicate with the central canal, and is most commonly 
seen in cervical levels of the spinal cord. The most common deﬁcits are a bilateral loss of pain 
and thermal sensation due to damage to the anterior white commissure: the loss reﬂects the lev-
els of the spinal cord damaged (e.g., a cape distribution over the shoulder and upper extremities). 
The other commonly seen deﬁcit results from extension of the cavity into the anterior horn(s). 
The result is unilateral or bilateral paralysis of the upper extremities (cervical levels) or lower 
extremities (lumbosacral levels) due to damage to spinal motor neurons. This paralysis is char-
acteristically a lower motor neuron deﬁcit. A syrinx in the spinal cord, particularly in cervical 
levels, may be associated with a variety of other developmental defects in the nervous system.
Spinal Cord Lesions
General Concepts
A complete spinal cord lesion is characterized by a bilateral and complete loss of motor and 
sensory function below the level of the lesion persisting for more than 24 hours. The vast major-
ity of the patients with complete lesions (95%+) will suffer some permanent deﬁcits. Incomplete 
spinal cord lesions are those with preservation of sacral cord function at presentation. The above 
described cases are examples of incomplete spinal cord lesions.

 
Arterial Patterns within the Spinal Cord with Vascular Syndromes
109
High Cervical
The phrenic nucleus is located in central areas of the anterior horn at levels C3–C7 and receives 
descending input from nuclei of the medulla (mainly in the reticular formation) that inﬂuence 
respiration, particularly inspiration. The phrenic nerve originates primarily from level C4 with 
some contributions from C3 and C5 and innervates the diaphragm. A complete spinal cord 
lesion between C1 and C3 interrupts medullary input to the phrenic nucleus and may result in 
immediate respiratory (and potentially cardiac) arrest. This constitutes a medical emergency 
necessitating intervention within minutes, or the patient will die.

6: Internal Morphology of the Spinal Cord and Brain in Stained Sections—The Degenerated Corticospinal Tract
All of the brainstem sections used in Figures 6-11 through 6-15 (medulla), 6-19 
through 6-22 (pons), and 6-24 through 6-29 (midbrain, except 6-25) are from an 
individual who had an infarct (green in drawing) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. 
This lesion damaged corticospinal ﬁbers (gray in drawing), resulting in a contralateral 
hemiplegia of the arm and leg, and damaged sensory radiations that travel from thalamic 
nuclei to the somatosensory cortex through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. 
Although the patient survived the initial episode, corticospinal ﬁbers (gray) distal to the 
lesion (green) underwent degenerative changes and largely disappeared. This Wallerian 
(anterograde) degeneration takes place because the capsular infarct effectively separates the 
descending corticospinal ﬁbers from their cell bodies in the cerebral cortex. Consequently, 
the location of corticospinal ﬁbers in the middle one-third of the crus cerebri of the mid-
brain, in the basilar pons, and in the pyramid of the medulla is characterized by the obvious 
lack of myelinated axons in these structures when compared to the opposite side. In the 
brainstem, these degenerated ﬁbers are ipsilateral to their cells of origin, but are contralat-
eral to their destination in the spinal cord—hence, the contralateral motor deﬁcit when 
these ﬁbers are damaged rostral to the motor decussation. These images give the user the 
unique opportunity of seeing where corticospinal ﬁbers are located at all levels of the 
human brainstem. Also, one is constantly reminded of: 1) the relationship of corticospinal 
ﬁbers to other structures; 2) the deﬁcits one can expect to see at representative levels due to 
this lesion; and 3) the general appearance of degenerated ﬁbers in the human central nerv-
ous system. These images can be adapted to a wide range of instructional formats.

Transverse section of the medulla through the motor decussation (decussation 
of the pyramids [pyramidal decussation], crossing of corticospinal ﬁbers). 
This is the level of the spinal cord–medulla transition. The corticospinal ﬁbers have moved 
from their location in the lateral funiculus to the motor decussation (compare this image 
with Figure 6-7A, B) and will cross to form the pyramid on the opposite side.

of each section, and the general pattern of arterial distribution overlies these structures on 
the right side. The general distribution patterns of arteries in the medulla, as illustrated 
here, may vary from patient to patient. For example, the territories served by adjacent ves-
sels may overlap to differing degrees at their margins, or the territory of a particular vessel 
may be smaller or larger than seen in the typical pattern.

The combination of corticospinal deﬁcits on one side of the body coupled with a cranial 
nerve motor deﬁcit on the opposite is called a middle alternating hemiplegia when the lesion is 
at this level. Diplopia will result (abducens nerve lesion) on gaze toward the side of the lesion. 
Involvement of the abducens nucleus may also result in an inability to adduct the contralateral 
medial rectus muscle (damage to abducens internuclear neurons).

Lesions that damage more lateral pontine areas generally are referred to as the Gubler syn-
drome (or the Millard-Gubler syndrome, although Gubler is preferred). In some instances, the 
term midpontine base syndrome is used to describe a basilar pontine lesion that involves the 
trigeminal root as well. Occlusion of the basilar artery may result in a locked-in-syndrome. This

Slightly oblique section through the midbrain–diencephalon junction. The 
section passes through the posterior commissure, the rostral end of the red 
nucleus, and ends just dorsal to the mammillary body. At this level, the structure labeled 
mammillothalamic tract probably also contains some mammillotegmental ﬁbers. Struc-
tures at the midbrain–thalamus junction are best seen in an MRI angled to accommodate 
that speciﬁc plane. To make the transition from drawing to stained section to MRI easy, 
selected structures in the MRI are labeled.

This may result from occlusion of the paramedian branches of the P1 segment of the posterior 
cerebral artery (PCA).

UÊ "VÕÌÀÊiÀÛi
This combination of motor deﬁcits at this level of the brainstem is called a superior alter-
nating hemiplegia. This pattern consists of ipsilateral paralysis of eye movement (with pupil 
dilation) and contralateral hemiplegia of the upper and lower extremities. Damage to the corti-
conuclear (corticobulbar) ﬁbers in the crus cerebri may result in a partial deﬁcit in tongue and 
facial movement on the contralateral side. These cranial nerve deﬁcits are seen as a deviation of 
the tongue to the side opposite the lesion on protrusion and a paralysis of the lower half of the 
facial muscles on the contralateral side. Although parts of the substantia nigra are frequently 
involved, akinesia and dyskinesia are not frequently seen.

ﬁbers
The lesion in this syndrome may extend laterally into the medial lemniscus and the dorsally 
adjacent ventral trigeminothalamic ﬁbers. If this was the case, there could conceivably be a loss 
or diminution of position and vibratory sense and of discriminative touch from the contralateral 
arm and partial loss of pain and thermal sensation from the contralateral face.
Benedikt Syndrome
This results from a larger lesion of the midbrain that essentially involves both of the sepa-
rate areas of Weber and Claude. The main deﬁcits are contralateral hemiplegia of the extremi-
ties (corticospinal ﬁbers), ipsilateral paralysis of eye movement with dilated pupil (oculomotor 
nerve), and cerebellar and rubral tremor and ataxia (red nucleus and cerebellothalamic ﬁbers). 
Slight variations may be present based on the extent of the lesion.
Parinaud Syndrome
This syndrome is usually caused by a tumor in the pineal region, such as germinoma, astrocy-
toma, pineocytoma/pineoblastoma, or any of a variety of other tumors that impinge on the supe-
rior colliculi. The potential for occlusion at the cerebral aqueduct in these cases also indicates 
that hydrocephalus may be a component of this syndrome. The deﬁcits in these patients consist 
Semi-diagrammatic representation of the internal distribution of arteries in the mid-
brain. Selected main structures are labeled on the left side of each section; the typical 
pattern of arterial distribution overlies these structures on the right side. The general distribu-
tion patterns of the vessels to the midbrain, as shown here, may vary somewhat from patient to 
patient. For example, the adjacent territories served by neighboring vessels may overlap to dif-
fering degrees at their margins, or the territory of a particular vessel may be larger or smaller 
than seen in the general pattern.

of a paralysis of upward gaze (superior colliculi), hydrocephalus (occlusion of the cerebral aque-
duct), and eventually a failure of eye movement due to pressure on the oculomotor and trochlear 
nuclei. These patients also may exhibit nystagmus due to involvement of the medial longitudinal 
fasciculus.
Uncal Herniation
Herniation of the uncus occurs in response to large and/or rapidly expanding lesions most fre-
quently in the temporal lobe; this is a supratentorial location. Uncal herniation is an extru-
sion of the uncus through the tentorial notch (tentorial incisura) with resultant pressure on 
the oculomotor nerve and the crus cerebri. Initially, the pupils, unilaterally or bilaterally, may 
dilate or respond slowly to light, followed by weakness of oculomotor movement. As herniation 
progresses, the pupils become fully dilated, oculomotor movements may be slow or absent, and 
the eyes deviate slightly laterally because of the unopposed actions of the abducens nerves. There 
is usually weakness on the contralateral side of the body due to compression of corticospinal 
ﬁbers in the crus cerebri. This combination of ipsilateral oculomotor palsy and a contralateral 
hemiplegia is also known as a superior alternating hemiplegia.
An alternative situation is when the pressure from the uncal herniation shifts the entire mid-
brain to the opposite side. In this case, the oculomotor root may be stretched or avulsed on the 
side of the herniation (the ipsilateral side), and the crus cerebri on the contralateral impaled 
against the edge of the tentorium cerebelli with consequent damage to corticospinal ﬁbers within 
the crus. This patient presents with an oculomotor palsy and a hemiplegia of the UE and LE 
both on the same side of the body. This combination of deﬁcits is called the Kernohan syndrome 
(or Kernohan phenomenon).
Especially large, or bilateral, supratentorial lesions may also result in decorticate rigidity 
(ﬂexion of forearm, wrist, and ﬁngers with adduction of UE; extension of LE with internal 
rotation and plantar ﬂexion of foot). As the lesion descends through the tentorial notch into 
an infratentorial location, decorticate rigidity gives rise to decerebrate rigidity (UE and LE 
extended, toes pointed inward, forearm pronated, and head and neck extended—opisthotonos).

6: Internal Morphology of the Spinal Cord and Brain in Stained Sections—Arterial Patterns within the Forebrain
Vascular Syndromes or Lesions of the Forebrain
Forebrain vascular lesions result in a wide range of deﬁcits that include motor and sensory losses 
and a variety of cognitive disorders. Forebrain vessels may be occluded by a thrombus. This is 
a structure (usually a clot) formed by blood products and frequently attached to the vessel wall. 
Deﬁcits may appear slowly, or wax and wane, as the blood ﬂow is progressively restricted.
Vessels may also be occluded by embolization. A foreign body, or embolus (fat, air, piece of 
thrombus, piece of sclerotic plaque, clump of bacteria, etc.), is delivered from some distant site 
into the cerebral circulation where it lodges in a vessel. Because this is a sudden event, deﬁcits 
usually appear quickly and may progress rapidly. Interruption of blood supply to a part of the 
forebrain results in an infarct of the area served by the occluded vessel.
Lesion in the Subthalamic Nucleus
Small vascular lesions occur in the subthalamic nucleus, resulting in rapid and unpredictable ﬂailing 
movements of the contralateral extremities (hemiballismus). Movements are more obvious in the 
upper extremity than in the lower extremity. The clinical expression of this lesion is through corti-
cospinal ﬁbers; therefore, these deﬁcits are located on the side of the body contralateral to the lesion.
Occlusion of Lenticulostriate Branches to Internal Capsule
Damage to the internal capsule may result in contralateral hemiplegia (corticospinal ﬁbers) and a 
loss, or diminution, of sensory perception (pain, thermal sense, proprioception) caused by dam-
age to thalamocortical ﬁbers traversing the posterior limb to the overlying sensory cortex. If the 
lesion extends into the genu of the capsule (damaging corticonuclear ﬁbers), a partial paralysis 
of facial muscles and tongue movement may also occur contralaterally.
Infarction of Posterior Thalamic Nuclei
Occlusion of vessels to posterior thalamic regions results in either a complete sensory loss (pain/
thermal sense, touch, and vibratory and position sense) on the contralateral side of the body or 
a dissociated sensory loss. In the latter case, the patient may experience pain/thermal sensory 
losses but not position/vibratory losses, or vice versa. As the lesion resolves, the patient may 
experience intense persistent pain, thalamic pain, or anesthesia dolorosa.
Occlusion of Distal Branches of the Anterior or Middle Cerebral Arteries
Occlusion of distal branches of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) results in motor and sensory losses 
in the contralateral foot, leg, and thigh owing to damage to the anterior and posterior paracentral 
gyri (primary motor and sensory cortices for the lower extremity). Occlusion of distal branches of the 
middle cerebral artery (MCA) results in contralateral motor and sensory losses of the upper extrem-
ity, trunk, and face with sparing of the leg and foot, and a consensual deviation of the eyes to the ipsi-
lateral side. This represents damage to the precentral and postcentral gyri and the frontal eye ﬁelds.
Watershed Infarct
Sudden systemic hypotension, hypoperfusion, or embolic showers may result in infarcts at bor-
der zones between the territories served by the ACA, MCA, and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). 
Anterior watershed infarcts (at the ACA–MCA junction) result in a contralateral hemiparesis 
(mainly the LE) and expressive language or behavioral changes. Posterior watershed infarcts 
(MCA–PCA interface) result in visual deﬁcits and language problems.

Anterior Choroidal Artery Syndrome
Occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery may result from small emboli or small vessel disease. 
This syndrome may also occur as a complication of temporal lobectomy (removal of the tempo-
ral lobe to treat intractable epilepsy). The infarcted area usually includes the optic tract, lower 
portions of the basal nuclei, and lower aspects of the internal capsule.
The patient experiences a contralateral homonymous hemianopia (damage to the optic tract) and 
a contralateral hemiplegia (damage to corticospinal ﬁbers at the transition of the internal capsule 
into the crus cerebri). If the infarct involves enough of the posterior limb to also damage thalamocor-
tical ﬁbers from the ventral posterolateral nucleus to the somatosensory cortex, the patient will also 
have a hemianesthesia (or possibly hemihypesthesia) on the same side of the body as the hemiplegia.
Parkinson Disease
Parkinson disease (paralysis agitans) results from a loss of the dopamine-containing cells in the 
substantia nigra. Although this part of the brain is located in the midbrain, the terminals of these 
nigrostriatal ﬁbers are in the putamen and caudate nucleus. The classic signs and symptoms of this 
disease are a stooped posture, resting tremor, rigidity, shufﬂing or festinating gait, and difﬁculty ini-
tiating or maintaining movement (akinesia, hypokinesia, or bradykinesia). Initially, the tremor and 
walking difﬁculty may appear on one side of the body, but these signs usually spread to both sides 
with time. This is a neurodegenerative disease that has a dementia component in its later stages.
Transient Ischemic Attack
A transient ischemic attack, commonly called TIA, is a temporary (and frequently focal) neurolog-
ical deﬁcit that usually resolves within 10 to 40 minutes from the onset of symptoms. The cause 
is temporary occlusion of a vessel or inadequate perfusion of a restricted vascular territory. TIAs 
that last 60 minutes or more may result in some permanent deﬁcits. This vascular event may take 
place anywhere in the central nervous system but is more common in the cerebral hemisphere.
Semi-diagrammatic representation of the internal distribution of arteries to the dien-
cephalon, basal nuclei, and internal capsule. Selected structures are labeled on the left 
side of each section; the general pattern of arterial distribution overlies these structures on the 
right side. The general distribution patterns of arteries in the forebrain, as shown here, may 
vary from patient to patient. For example, the adjacent territories served by neighboring vessels 
may overlap to varying degrees at their margins or the territory of a particular vessel may be 
larger or smaller than seen in the general pattern.

Internal Morphology of  
the Brain in Stained 
Sections: Axial–Sagittal 
Correlations with MRI
lthough the general organization of Chapter 7 has been 
described in Chapter 1 (the reader may wish to refer back to 
this section), it is appropriate to reiterate its unique features at 
this point. Each set of facing pages has photographs of an axial stained 
section (left-hand page) and a sagittal stained section (right-hand page). 
In addition to individually labeled structures, a heavy red line appears 
on each photograph. This prominent line on the axial section repre-
sents the approximate plane of the sagittal section located on the facing 
page. On the sagittal section, this line signiﬁes the approximate plane 
of the corresponding axial section. The reader can identify features in 
each photograph and then, using this line as a reference point, visualize 
structures that are located either above or below that plane (axial-to-
sagittal comparison) or medial or lateral to that plane (sagittal-to-axial 
comparison). This method of presentation provides a useful format that 
will form the basis for a three-dimensional understanding of structures 
and relationships within the central nervous system.
The magnetic resonance image (MRI) placed on every page in this 
chapter gives the reader an opportunity to compare internal brain 
anatomy, as seen in stained sections, with those structures as visualized 
in clinical images generated in the same plane. Even a general compari-
son reveals that many features, as seen in the stained section, can be 
readily identiﬁed in the adjacent MRI.
This chapter is also organized so that one can view structures in 
either the axial or the sagittal plane only. Axial images appear on left-
hand pages and are sequenced from dorsal to ventral (odd-numbered 
Figures 7-1 through 7-9), whereas sagittal images are on the right-hand 
pages and progress from medial to lateral (even-numbered Figures 7-2 
through 7-10). Consequently, the user can identify and follow structures 
through an axial series by simply ﬂipping through the left-hand pages 
or through a sagittal series by ﬂipping through the right-hand pages. 
The inherent ﬂexibility in this chapter should prove useful in a wide 
variety of instructional/learning situations. The drawings shown in the 
following illustrate the axial and sagittal planes of the photographs in 
this chapter.

eral key thalamic nuclei (anterior, centromedian, pulvinar, and 
habenular). In this plane of section, the internal medullary lamina, sepa-
rates the dorsomedial nucleus from a lateral row comprising the ventral 
anterior, ventral lateral, and ventral posterolateral nuclei. Rostrally, the 
internal medullary lamina encompasses the anterior nucleus of the thala-
mus, and the pulvinar is located caudal to the centromedian and ventral 
7-1
posterolateral nuclei. Collectively the anterior nucleus and the pulvinar 
form the rostral and caudal extents, respectively, of the dorsal thalamus 
in this axial section. The centromedian nucleus is located within the inter-
nal medullary lamina and is the largest of the intralaminar nuclei. The 
heavy red line represents the approximate plane of the sagittal section 
shown in Figure 7-2 (facing page). Many of the structures labeled in this 
photograph can be clearly identiﬁed in the adjacent T1-weighted MRI.

Sagittal section through the column of the fornix, anterior tha-

(abducens nucleus), cerebellum (fastigial nucleus), and medulla (nucleus 
gracilis). As the fornix (body to column) arches around the anterior tha-
lamic nucleus, the space formed between the column of the fornix and the 
anterior thalamic nucleus is the interventricular foramen (see Figure 7-1 
on the facing page). The column of the fornix continues immediately cau-
dal to the anterior commissure, as the postcommissural fornix, to end in 
the mammillary body. Note the relative positions of the red nucleus and 
decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle within the midbrain.
7-2
In this sagittal plane, the general structures seen at the level of the 
superior and inferior colliculi can be fully appreciated. A cross-section 
through the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus contains the 
oculomotor nucleus and roots, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and crus 
cerebri. A cross-section of midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus is 
characterized by the trochlear nucleus, decussation of the superior cere-
bellar peduncle, substantia nigra, and crus cerebri. The heavy red line 
represents the approximate plane of the axial section shown in Figure 7-1 
(facing page). Many of the structures labeled in this photograph can be 
clearly identiﬁed in the adjacent T1-weighted MRI (RNu = red nucleus).

lateral nuclei are evident as is the relative position of the centromedian 
nucleus to the ventral posterolateral, medial geniculate, and the pulvi-
nar nuclei. As seen here, and in Figures 7-1 and 7-5, the four major 
7-3
portions of the internal capsule are obvious in the axial plane, these 
being the anterior limb, genu, posterior limb, and the retrolenticular 
limb. The heavy red line represents the approximate plane of the sagit-

the position of the facial motor nucleus at the pons–medulla junction. 
In this sagittal plane, several of the thalamic nuclei are clearly demar-
cated, and the important relationships between the red nucleus, sub-
stantia nigra, and crus cerebri are seen. Note that the ﬁbers of the crus 
cerebri traverse the basilar pons and that the medial lemniscus is located 
at the interface of the basilar pons and the pontine tegmentum.

The teardrop shape of the anterior thalamic nucleus, which is clearly 
seen in this image, illustrates how the anterior nucleus may be seen in 
some coronal sections that also include the ventral lateral thalamic 
nucleus (see Figure 6-35A, B). Many clinically signiﬁcant structures in 
the brainstem also stand out. The heavy red line represents the approxi-
mate plane of the axial section shown in Figure 7-3 (facing page). Many 
of the structures labeled in this photograph can be clearly identiﬁed in 
the adjacent T1-weighted MRI (H = Forel ﬁeld H [prerubral area];

of the pulvinar. This axial section is through the upper portions of the 
hypothalamus and the lower, and widest, portions of the lenticular 
nucleus. The anterior limb of the internal capsule is beginning to disap-
pear (the caudate head and putamen will join), and inferior portions of the 
ventral lateral, ventral posterolateral, and pulvinar nuclei are still present.
The column of the fornix, which lies immediately caudal to the ante-
rior commissure, arches caudally to enter in the mammillary nuclei, and 
7-5
the mammillothalamic tract arises from the mammillary nuclei and 
ascends to the anterior thalamic nucleus. Note the relative rostrocaudal 
position of these tracts within the stained section and within the MRI. 
The heavy red line represents the approximate plane of the sagittal sec-
tion shown in Figure 7-6 (facing page). Many of the structures labeled 
in this photograph can be clearly identiﬁed in the adjacent T1-weighted

plane along with the characteristics of the interface of midbrain structures 
with the diencephalon. Note how the ﬁbers of the crus cerebri splay out

axial section is slightly tilted; the sides (right/left) of the stained section 
are considered the same as the sides (right/left) in the adjacent MRI. 
The right side is more ventral and shows the optic tract in close proxim-
ity to the crus cerebri, the junction of the fornix and mammillothalamic 
tract at the mammillary body, and the amygdaloid nucleus and hippoc-
ampus in the medial temporal horn. The left side is more dorsal and 
contains the fornix and mammillothalamic tract separate within the 
hypothalamus (see also Figure 7-5), the subthalamic nucleus adjacent to 
the crus, the red nucleus, and junction of the caudate and putamen. The 
geniculate nuclei are also seen on the patient’s left; the trochlear nuclei 
are present on both sides.
The optic tract is always located on the surface of the crus cerebri 
(see also Figure 7-8 on the facing page) no matter what the plane of 
7-7
section. Also note the thin membranous nature of the lamina terminalis 
(see also Figures 7-5 and 7-9) separating the cistern of the lamina termi-
nalis (rostral to it) from the space of the third ventricle (caudal to it). 
This structure frequently separates blood within the cistern from a lack 
of blood within the third ventricle (see Figure 4-7 on p. 65), or blood 
within the third ventricle from a lack of blood within the cistern (see 
Figure 4-13 on p. 71).
The heavy red line represents the approximate plane of the sagittal

hemisphere, when continued into the midbrain, represents a slightly 
oblique section through the mesencephalon. Compare the appearance 
of the midbrain in this axial section with that in Figures 6-24 to 6-29 on 
pp. 140 to 151. Many of the structures labeled in this photograph can 
be clearly identiﬁed in the adjacent T1-weighted MRI (MedSeg = Medial 
segment of globus pallidus; LatSeg = Lateral segment of globus pallidus).

portions of the pons, middle cerebellar peduncle, cochlear nuclei, 
and the cerebellum (dentate nucleus). In this sagittal plane, several 
important relationships are seen. First, the head of the caudate and 
putamen coalesce in the rostral and ventral area of the hemisphere. 
Second, the important structures in the immediate vicinity of the 
zona incerta and subthalamic nucleus are obvious. Third, the medial 
7-8
geniculate nucleus is characteristically located just inferior to the 
pulvinar and separated from it by the brachium of the superior 
 colliculus. As noted in other ﬁgures in this chapter, the optic tract has 
an intimate apposition to the crus cerebri regardless of the plane of 
section. The heavy red line represents the approximate plane of the 
axial section shown in Figure 7-7 (facing page). Many of the struc-
tures labeled in this photograph can be clearly identiﬁed in the adja-
cent T1-weighted MRI.

Axial section through ventral portions of the hypothalamus 
(supraoptic recess and mammillary body) and forebrain (amy-

cerebellar peduncle decussation in the midbrain. This axial section is 
slightly tilted through the lowest portions of the hypothalamus as evi-
denced by the presence of the supraoptic recess, a relatively small por-
tion of the hypothalamus (especially on the right), lower parts of the 
mammillary bodies, and part of the supraoptic nucleus.
Note the close relationship of the uncus to the crus cerebri (also in 
the MRI), particularly on the right side, and the fact that the amy-
gdaloid nucleus is internal to the uncus in the rostral wall of the tempo-
ral horn of the lateral ventricle (also on the right). This close apposition 
7-9
of the uncus to the crus is the anatomical basis for damage to midbrain 
structures in cases of uncal herniation when there is impingement on, or 
shifting of, the midbrain structures resultant to enlarging temporal lobe 
lesions (see also Chapter 9). Also note, on the left, that the optic tract is 
located directly adjacent to the crus and ends in the lateral geniculate 
nucleus. The tail of the caudate is in the lateral wall of the ventricle, and 
the hippocampus is medially located.
The heavy red line represents the approximate plane of the sagittal sec-
tion shown in Figure 7-10 (facing page). The axial plane through the hem-

(see Figure 7-8), is also located immediately inferior to the pulvinar. This

Tracts, Pathways, and 
Systems in Anatomical  
and Clinical Orientation
he study of regional neurobiology (brain structures in gross 
specimens, brain slices, stained sections, and MRI and CT) 
is the basis for the study of systems neurobiology (tracts, 
pathways, and cranial nerves and their functions), which in turn is the 
basis for understanding and diagnosing the neurologically impaired 
patient. Building on the concepts learned in earlier chapters, this chap-
ter explores systems neurobiology, with a particular emphasis on clini-
cal relevance and correlations.
The modiﬁcations made in this chapter recognize an essential real-
ity for users of this book who are preparing for a career in medi-
cine, as broadly deﬁned. Although it is common to teach the anatomy 
of the brain in an Anatomical Orientation (e.g., in the medulla, the 
pyramid is “down” in the image and the fourth ventricle is “up”), 
this information will be viewed and used, in the clinical years and 
beyond, in a Clinical Orientation (pyramid “up” in the image, fourth 
ventricle “down”). Therefore, it is essential to present systems infor-
mation in a format that resembles, as closely as reasonably possible, 
how these systems (and dysfunctions thereof) are viewed in the clini-
cal setting. To this end, selected systems are illustrated in the Clinical 
Orientation.
Anatomical Orientation
Major pathways, including those essential to diagnosis of the neuro-
logically compromised patient, are illustrated in line drawings in an 
Anatomical Orientation. The format of each set of these facing pages 
is designed to summarize, accurately and concisely, the relationships 
of a given tract or pathway. This includes, but is not limited to: 1) 
the location of the cells of origin for a given tract or pathway; 2) its 
entire course throughout the neuraxis and cerebrum; 3) the location 
of the decussation of these ﬁbers, if applicable; 4) the neurotransmit-
ters associated with the neurons comprising the tract or pathway; 5) 
a brief review of its blood supply; and 6) a summary of a number 
of deﬁcits seen as a result of lesions at various points in the tract or 
pathway.
Clinical Orientation
Twelve of the systems pathways, with particular emphasis on those 
essential to understanding the patient with neurological problems, are 
also illustrated in Clinical Orientation. These pathway illustrations do 
not replace their counterparts shown in Anatomical Orientation, but 
are designed to complement these existing drawings. These sets of fac-
ing pages are formatted to show the pathway superimposed on MRI at 
representative levels of the central nervous system (CNS) (left page) and 
summarize the deﬁcits seen following lesions at various CNS levels that 
involve the pathway (right page). These illustrations show: 1) the posi-
tion of the tract/ﬁbers in MRI at representative levels; 2) the somatotopy 
(if applicable) of the tract as it appears in MRI/clinical orientation; 3) 
the trajectory of the tract/ﬁbers through the CNS; 4) deﬁcits correlated 
with the location of lesions at various locations and levels; and 5) the 
laterality (R/L) of the deﬁcit as dictated by the position of the lesion in 
the MRI.
Intra-axial brainstem lesions frequently result in both sensory and 
motor deﬁcits. Recognizing this fact, both types of deﬁcits are listed for 
those lesions illustrated on the MRI pathways. However, for sensory 
pathways, sensory deﬁcits are listed ﬁrst and motor deﬁcits are listed 
last. For motor pathways, the reverse is used: motor deﬁcits are listed 
ﬁrst, and sensory deﬁcits listed last. This approach emphasizes the par-
ticular pathway being described but, at the same time, acknowledges 
the multiplicity of deﬁcits resulting from CNS lesions.
Additional Points
The structure of an atlas does not allow a detailed deﬁnition of each 
clinical term on the printed page. However, as in other chapters, the 
full deﬁnition of each clinical term or phrase, when used, is avail-
able from the online resources that come with this atlas; here these 
deﬁnitions are taken from the current edition of Stedman’s Medical 
Dictionary, but they are also available from any standard medical dic-
tionary, neurology text, or colleagues in the clinics. Researching the 
full deﬁnition of a clinical term or phrase is a powerful and effective 
learning tool.
The layout of all illustrations in this chapter clearly shows the lat-
erality of the tract or pathway. That is, the relationship between the 
location of the cell of origin and the termination of the ﬁbers making up 
a tract or pathway or the projections of cranial nerve nuclei. Although 
this is clear in the anatomical drawings, it is particularly relevant to the 
clinical setting, as shown in the MRI pathway illustrations. This infor-
mation is absolutely essential to understand the position of a lesion and 
correlate this fact with the deﬁcits seen in the neurologically compro-
mised patient. For example, is the deﬁcit on the same side as the lesion 
(ipsilateral), the opposite side (contralateral), or both sides (bilateral)? 
The concept of laterality is expressed as as “right” or commonly as R in 
a circle, “left” or as L in a circle, or “bilateral” in reference to the side 
of the deﬁcit(s) when written on the patient’s chart.
This chapter is designed to maximize the correlation between struc-
ture and function, provide a range of clinical examples for each tract or 
pathway, and help the user develop a knowledge base that can be easily 
integrated into the clinical setting.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Orientation 
Orientation Drawing for Pathways in Anatomical Orientation
Orientation drawing for pathways. The trajectories of path-
ways in the Anatomical Orientation are illustrated in Chapter 8 
on individualized versions of a representation of the central nervous 
system (CNS). Although slight changes are made in each drawing, so as 
to more clearly diagram a speciﬁc pathway, the basic conﬁguration of 
the CNS is as represented here. This allows the user to move from path-
way to pathway without being required to learn a different representa-
tion or drawing for each pathway; also, laterality of the pathway, a 
feature essential to diagnosis, is inherently evident in each illustration. 
In addition, many pathways, particularly those that are essential to 
diagnosis, are also shown on MRI and are, therefore, shown in a Clini-
cal Orientation.
The forebrain (telencephalon and diencephalon) is shown in the 
coronal plane, and the midbrain, pons, medulla, and spinal cord are 
represented through their longitudinal axes. The internal capsule is rep-
resented in the axial plane in an effort to show the rostrocaudal distri-
bution of ﬁbers located therein.
The reader can become familiar with the structures and regions as 
shown here because their locations and relationships are easily transfer-
able to subsequent illustrations. It may be helpful to refer back to this 
illustration when using subsequent sections of this chapter.
Neurotransmitters
Three important facts are self-evident in the descriptions of neurotrans-
mitters that accompany each pathway drawing. These are illustrated by 
noting, as an example, that glutamate is found in corticospinal ﬁbers 
(see Figure 8-11). First, the location of neuronal cell bodies contain-
ing a speciﬁc transmitter is indicated (glutamate-containing cell bodies 
are found in cortical areas projecting to the spinal cord). Second, the 
trajectory of ﬁbers containing a particular neurotransmitter is obvious 
from the route taken by the tract (glutaminergic corticospinal ﬁbers are 
found in the internal capsule, crus cerebri, basilar pons, pyramid, and 
8-1
lateral corticospinal tract). Third, the location of terminals containing 
speciﬁc neurotransmitters is indicated by the site(s) of termination of 
each tract (glutaminergic terminals of corticospinal ﬁbers are located in 
the spinal cord gray matter). In addition, the action of most neuroactive 
substances is indicated as excitatory (+) or inhibitory (–). This level of 
neurotransmitter information, as explained here for glutaminergic cor-
ticospinal ﬁbers, is repeated for each pathway drawing.
Clinical Correlations
The clinical correlations are designed to give the user an overview of 
speciﬁc deﬁcits (i.e., hemiplegia, resting tremor) seen in lesions of each 
pathway and to provide examples of some syndromes or diseases (e.g., 
Brown-Séquard syndrome, Parkinson disease) in which these deﬁcits 
are seen. Although purposefully brief, these correlations highlight 
examples of deﬁcits for each pathway and provide a built-in mechanism 
for expanded study. For example, the words in bold in each correlation 
are clinical terms and phrases that are here taken from the current edi-
tion of Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, but they are also available from 
any standard medical dictionary, neurology text, or colleagues in the 
clinics.
An especially useful feature of this Atlas is the fact that the full deﬁ-
nition of all clinical terms that are indicated in bold (PICA syndrome, 
hemiplegia, resting tremor, etc.) is easily available when using the online 
resources through thePoint; instructions to access thePoint are in the 
inside of the front cover. Consulting these sources, especially the online 
resources, will signiﬁcantly enhance understanding of the deﬁcits seen in 
the neurologically compromised patient. Expanded information, based 
on the deﬁcits mentioned in this chapter, is integrated into some of the 
questions for Chapter 8. Referring to such sources allows the user to 
glean important clinical points that correlate with the pathway under 
consideration, and enlarge his or her knowledge and understanding by 
researching the italicized words and phrases.

 8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Sensory Pathways
Posterior (Dorsal) Column–Medial Lemniscus System in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and distribution of ﬁbers comprising the 
posterior (dorsal) column–medial lemniscus (PC–ML) system. 
This illustration shows the longitudinal extent, positions in representa-
tive cross sections of brainstem and spinal cord, and somatotopy of ﬁb-
ers in both the posterior column (PC) and medial lemniscus (ML) 
portions of this system. The ML undergoes positional changes as it 
courses from the myelencephalon (medulla) rostrally toward the mesen-
cephalic–diencephalic junction. In the medulla, ML and anterolateral 
system (ALS) ﬁbers are widely separated and receive different blood 
supplies, whereas they are served by a common arterial source in the 
midbrain. As the ML makes positional changes, the somatotopy therein 
follows accordingly. Fibers of the postsynaptic posterior column system 
(shown in green) are considered in detail in Figure 8-6 on p. 200.
Neurotransmitters
Acetylcholine and the excitatory amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, 
are associated with some of the large-diameter, heavily myelinated ﬁbers 
of the posterior horn and posterior columns.
Clinical Correlations
An ipsilateral loss of vibratory sensation, position sense, and discrimi-
native touch (stereoanesthesia, impaired graphesthesia, and tactile 
localization) on one side of the body below the level of the lesion cor-
relates with damage to the PC on the same side of the spinal cord (e.g., 
Brown-Séquard syndrome). While astereognosis, stereoagnosis, or tac-
tile agnosia are sometimes used to describe PC damage, they are most 
commonly used to specify parietal lobe lesions.
8-2
The term stereoanesthesia is also frequently used to specify a lesion 
of peripheral nerves that results in an inability to perceive proprio-
ceptive and tactile sensations. Bilateral damage (e.g., tabes dorsalis 
[tabetic neurosyphilis] or subacute combined degeneration of the spi-
nal cord) produces bilateral losses. Although ataxia is the most com-
mon feature in patients with tabes dorsalis, they also have a loss of 
muscle stretch reﬂexes, severe lancinating pain over the body below 
the head (more common in the lower extremity), and bladder dysfunc-
tion. The ataxia that may be seen in patients with posterior column 
lesions (sensory ataxia) is due to a lack of proprioceptive input and 
position sense. These individuals tend to forcibly place their feet to the 
ﬂoor in an attempt to stimulate the missing sensory input. A patient 
with mild ataxia due to posterior column disease may compensate for 
the motor deﬁcit by using visual cues. Patients with subacute com-
bined degeneration of the spinal cord ﬁrst have signs and symptoms 
of posterior column involvement, followed later by signs of corticos-
pinal tract damage (spastic weakness of legs, increased muscle stretch 
reﬂexes [hyperreﬂexia], Babinski sign).
Rostral to the sensory decussation, medial lemniscus lesions result 
in contralateral losses that include the entire body, excluding the head. 
Brainstem lesions involving medial lemniscus ﬁbers usually include 
adjacent structures, result in motor and additional sensory losses, and 
may reﬂect the distribution patterns of vessels (e.g., medial medullary 
or medial pontine syndromes). Large lesions in the forebrain may result 
in a complete contralateral loss of modalities carried in the posterior 
columns and anterolateral systems, or may produce pain or paresthesia 
(e.g., the thalamic syndrome).

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Anterolateral System in Anatomical Orientation
The longitudinal extent and somatotopy of ﬁbers comprising 
the anterolateral system (ALS). The ALS is a composite bundle 
containing ascending ﬁbers that terminate in the reticular formation 
(spinoreticular ﬁbers), mesencephalon (spinotectal ﬁbers to deep layers 
of the superior colliculus, spinoperiaqueductal ﬁbers to the periaque-
ductal gray), hypothalamus (spinohypothalamic ﬁbers), and sensory 
relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus (spinothalamic ﬁbers). Other ﬁbers 
in the ALS include spino-olivary projections to the accessory olivary 
nuclei. Spinothalamic ﬁbers terminate primarily in the VPL and retic-
ulothalamic ﬁbers terminate in some intralaminar nuclei and medial 
areas of the posterior thalamic complex.
Descending ﬁbers from the PAG and nucleus raphe dorsalis enter 
the nucleus raphe magnus and adjacent reticular area. These latter sites, 
in turn, project to laminae I, II, and V of the spinal cord via raphespi-
nal and reticulospinal ﬁbers that participate in the modulation of pain 
transmission in the spinal cord.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+), calcitonin gene–related peptide, and substance P (+)- 
containing posterior (dorsal) root ganglion cells project into laminae 
I, II (heavy), V (moderate), and III, IV (sparse). Some spinoreticular 
and spinothalamic ﬁbers contain enkephalin (–), somatostatin (–), and 
cholecystokinin (+). In addition to enkephalin and somatostatin, some 
spinomesencephalic ﬁbers contain vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (+). 
Neurons in the PAG and nucleus raphe dorsalis containing serotonin 
and neurotensin project into the nuclei raphe magnus and adjacent 
reticular formation. Cells in these latter centers that contain serotonin 
and enkephalin send processes to spinal cord laminae I, II, and V. Sero-
tonergic raphespinal or enkephalinergic reticulospinal ﬁbers may inhibit 
primary sensory ﬁbers or projection neurons, conveying nociceptive 
(pain) information.

Clinical Correlations
A loss of pain and temperature sensations on one side of the body sig-
niﬁes a lesion involving the ALS; the deﬁcit begins about two levels 
caudal to the lesion but on the contralateral side (e.g., Brown-Séquard 
syndrome). A bilateral loss of the same modalities, but in a dermatomal 
distribution, is characteristic of syringomyelia; the anterior white com-
missure is damaged by a cavitation (not ependymal lined) in the central 
cord area. A central cord cavitation lined by ependymal cells is a hydro-
myelia. Vascular lesions in the spinal cord (e.g., acute central cervical 
cord syndrome) may result in a bilateral and splotchy loss of pain and 
thermal sense below the lesion because the ALS has a dual vascular 
supply.
Vascular lesions in the lateral medulla (posterior inferior cerebel-
lar artery syndrome) or lateral pons (anterior inferior cerebellar artery 
occlusion) result in a loss of pain and thermal sensations over the entire 
contralateral side of the body (ALS) as well as on the ipsilateral face 
(spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus), coupled with other motor and/
or sensory deﬁcits based on damage to structures these vessels serve. 
Note that the ALS and PC–ML systems are separated in the medulla (in 
different vascular territories) but are adjacent to each other in the mid-
brain (the same vascular territory). Consequently, medullary lesions will 
not result in deﬁcits related to both pathways, whereas a lesion in the 
midbrain may result in a contralateral loss of pain, thermal, vibratory, 
and discriminative touch sensations on the body, excluding the head.
Profound loss of posterior column and anterolateral system 
modalities, or intractable pain and/or paresthesias (e.g., the thalamic 
syndrome), may result from vascular lesions in the posterolateral tha-
lamus. So-called thalamic pain also may be experienced by patients 
who have brainstem lesions that damage ﬁbers in the ALS and PC-ML 
system.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Postsynaptic–Posterior (Dorsal) Column System and the Spinocervicothalamic  
Pathway in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and distribution of ﬁbers comprising the 
postsynaptic–posterior column system (upper) and the spinoc-
ervicothalamic pathway (lower). Postsynaptic–posterior column ﬁbers 
originate primarily from cells in lamina IV (some cells in laminae III and 
V–VII also contribute), ascend in the ipsilateral dorsal fasciculi, and end 
in their respective nuclei in the caudal medulla. Moderate-to-sparse col-
laterals project to a few other medullary targets.
Fibers of the spinocervical part of the spinocervicothalamic pathway 
also originate from cells in lamina IV (less so from III and V). The axons 
of these cells ascend in the posterior part of the lateral funiculus (this is 
sometimes called the dorsolateral funiculus) and end in a topographic 
fashion in the lateral cervical nucleus: lumbosacral projections termi-
nate posterolaterally and cervical projections anteromedially. Axons 
arising from cells of the lateral cervical nucleus decussate in the anterior 
white commissure, and ascend to targets in the midbrain and thalamus. 
Cells of the posterior column nuclei also convey information to the con-
tralateral thalamus via the medial lemniscus.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+) and possibly substance P (+) are present in some spinoc-
ervical projections. Because some cells in laminae III–V have axons that 
8-6
collateralize to both the lateral cervical nucleus and the dorsal column 
nuclei, glutamate (and substance P) also may be present in some postsy-
naptic dorsal column ﬁbers.
Clinical Correlations
The postsynaptic–posterior column and spinocervicothalamic pathways 
are not known to be major circuits in the human nervous system. How-
ever, the occurrence of these ﬁbers may explain a well-known clinical 
observation. Patients who have received an anterolateral cordotomy 
(this lesion is placed just ventral to the denticulate ligament) for intrac-
table pain may experience complete or partial relief, or there may be 
a recurrence of pain perception within days or weeks. Although the 
cordotomy transects ﬁbers of the anterolateral system (the main pain 
pathway), this lesion spares the posterior horn, posterior columns, and 
spinocervical ﬁbers. Consequently, the recurrence of pain perception 
(or even the partial relief of pain) in these patients may be explained 
by these postsynaptic–dorsal column and spinocervicothalamic projec-
tions. Through these connections, some nociceptive (pain) information 
may be transmitted to the ventral posterolateral nucleus and on to the 
sensory cortex, via circuits that bypass the anterolateral system and are 
spared in a cordotomy.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Trigeminal Pathways in Anatomical Orientation
The distribution of general sensory GSA or SA information 
originating on CNs V (trigeminal), VII (facial), IX (glossopha-
ryngeal), and X (vagus). Some of these primary sensory ﬁbers end in the 
principal sensory nucleus, but many form the spinal trigeminal tract 
and end in the spinal trigeminal nucleus.
Neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and in ventrolateral parts 
of the principal sensory nucleus give rise to crossed ventral trigemi-
nothalamic ﬁbers. Collaterals of these ﬁbers inﬂuence the hypoglos-
sal, facial (corneal reﬂex, supraorbital, or trigeminofacial reﬂex), and 
trigeminal motor nuclei; mesencephalic collaterals are involved in the 
jaw reﬂex, or the jaw-jerk reﬂex. Collaterals also enter the dorsal motor 
vagal nucleus (vomiting reﬂex), the superior salivatory nucleus (tearing/ 
lacrimal reﬂex), and the nucleus ambiguus and adjacent reticular forma-
tion (sneezing reﬂex). Uncrossed dorsal trigeminothalamic ﬁbers arise 
from dorsomedial regions of the principal sensory nucleus.
Neurotransmitters
Substance P (+)-containing and cholecystokinin (+)-containing trigemi-
nal ganglion cells project to the spinal trigeminal nucleus, especially its 
caudal part (pars caudalis). Glutamate (+) is found in many trigemi-
nothalamic ﬁbers arising from the principal sensory nucleus and the 
pars interpolaris of the spinal nucleus. It is present in fewer trigeminoth-
alamic ﬁbers from the pars caudalis and in almost none from the pars 
oralis. The locus ceruleus (noradrenergic ﬁbers) and the raphe nuclei 
(serotonergic ﬁbers) also project to the spinal nucleus. Enkephalin 
(–)-containing cells are present in caudal regions of the spinal nucleus, 
and enkephalinergic ﬁbers are found in the nucleus ambiguus and in the 
hypoglossal, facial, and trigeminal motor nuclei.
Clinical Correlations
A loss of: 1) pain, temperature, and tactile sensation from the ipsilat-
eral face, oral cavity, and teeth; 2) ipsilateral paralysis of masticatory  
8-7
muscles; and 3) ipsilateral loss of the corneal reﬂex may indicate a lesion 
of the trigeminal ganglion or nerve proximal to the ganglion. Dam-
age to peripheral portions of the trigeminal nerve may be traumatic 
(skull fracture, especially of supraorbital and infraorbital branches), 
inﬂammatory (e.g., herpes zoster), or result from tumor growth (large 
vestibular schwannoma or meningioma). The deﬁcit would reﬂect the 
peripheral portion of the trigeminal nerve damaged.
Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is a severe burning pain 
restricted to the peripheral distribution of the trigeminal nerve, usually 
its V2 (maxillary) division. This pain may be initiated by any contact 
to areas of the face, such as the corner of the mouth, nose, lips, or 
cheek (e.g., shaving, putting on make-up, chewing, or even smiling). 
The attacks frequently occur without warning, may happen only a few 
times a month to many times in a single day, and are usually seen in 
patients 40 years of age or older. One probable cause of trigeminal neu-
ralgia is compression of the trigeminal root by aberrant vessels, most 
commonly a loop of the superior cerebellar artery (see p. 49). Other 
causes may include tumor, multiple sclerosis, and ephaptic transmission 
(ephapse) in the trigeminal ganglion. This is the most common type of 
neuralgia.
In the medulla, ﬁbers of the spinal trigeminal tract and ALS are 
served by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Conse-
quently, an alternating (alternate or crossed) hemianesthesia is one 
characteristic feature of the PICA syndrome. This is a loss of pain and 
thermal sensations on one side of the body and the opposite side of the 
face. Pontine gliomas may produce a paralysis of masticatory muscles 
(motor trigeminal damage) and some loss of tactile input (principal 
sensory nucleus damage), as well as other deﬁcits based on the adja-
cent structures involved.

Solitary Pathways in Anatomical Orientation
Visceral afferent input (SVA, taste; GVA, general visceral sensa-
tion) on CNs VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), and X (vagus) 
enters the solitary nuclei via the solitary tract. Recall that the SVA and 
GVA functional components may be collectively grouped as VA; Vis-
ceral Afferent. What is commonly called the solitary “nucleus” is a 
series of small nuclei that collectively form this rostrocaudal-oriented 
cell column.
Solitary cells project to the salivatory, hypoglossal, and dorsal motor 
vagal nuclei and the nucleus ambiguus. Solitary projections to the 
nucleus ambiguus are the intermediate neurons in the pathway for the 
gag reﬂex. The afferent limb of the gag reﬂex is carried on the glos-
sopharyngeal nerve, and the efferent limb originates from the nucleus 
ambiguus; the efferent limb travels on both CNs IX and X. Although 
not routinely tested, the gag reﬂex should be evaluated in patients with 
dysarthria, dysphagia, or hoarseness. Solitariospinal ﬁbers are bilateral 
with a contralateral preponderance and project to the phrenic nucleus, 
intermediolateral cell column, and ventral horn. The VPM is the 
thalamic center through which visceral afferent information is relayed 
onto the cerebral cortex. See Figures 8-27 to 8-31 (pp. 236–238) and 
Table 8-1 (p. 240) for brainstem reﬂexes.
Neurotransmitters
Substance P (+)-containing and cholecystokinin (+)-containing cells 
in the geniculate ganglion (facial nerve) and the inferior ganglia of 
the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves project to the solitary nucleus. 
Enkephalin (–), neurotensin, and GABA (+) are present in some 
8-9
solitary neurons that project into the adjacent dorsal motor vagal 
nucleus. Cholecystokinin (+), somatostatin (–), and enkephalin (–) are 
present in solitary neurons, cells of the parabrachial nuclei, and some 
thalamic neurons that project to taste and other visceral areas of the 
cortex.
Clinical Correlations
An ipsilateral loss of taste (ageusia) from the anterior two-thirds of the 
tongue and an ipsilateral facial (Bell) palsy may indicate damage to the 
geniculate ganglion or facial nerve proximal to the ganglion. Although 
a glossopharyngeal nerve lesion will result in ageusia from the posterior 
third of the tongue on the ipsilateral side, this loss is difﬁcult to test. 
On the other hand, glossopharyngeal neuralgia (this may also be called 
glossopharyngeal tic) is an idiopathic pain localized to the peripheral 
sensory branches of the ninth nerve in the posterior pharynx, posterior 
tongue, and tonsillar area. Although comparatively rare, glossopha-
ryngeal neuralgia may be aggravated by talking or even swallowing. 
Occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (e.g., the posterior 
inferior cerebellar artery or lateral medullary syndrome), in addition to 
producing an alternate hemianesthesia, also results in ageusia from the 
ipsilateral side of the tongue because the posterior inferior cerebellar 
artery serves the solitary tract and nuclei in the medulla.
Interestingly, lesions of the olfactory nerves or tract (anosmia, loss of 
olfactory sensation; dysosmia, distorted olfactory sense) may affect how 
the patient perceives taste. Witness the fact that the nasal congestion 
accompanying a severe cold markedly affects the sense of taste.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Motor Pathways
Corticospinal Tracts in Anatomical Orientation
The longitudinal extent of corticospinal ﬁbers and their posi-
tion and somatotopy at representative levels within the neu-
raxis. The somatotopy of corticospinal ﬁbers in the basilar pons is less 
obvious than in the internal capsule, crus cerebri, pyramid, or spinal 
cord. In the motor decussation (pyramidal decussation), ﬁbers originat-
ing from upper extremity areas of the cerebral cortex cross rostral to 
those that arise from lower extremity areas. In addition to ﬁbers arising 
from the precentral gyrus (somatomotor area, area 4), a signiﬁcant con-
tingent also originates from the postcentral gyrus (areas 3, 1, 2); the 
former terminate primarily in laminae VI–IX, whereas the latter end 
mainly in laminae IV and V. Frontal area 6, and parietal areas 5 and 7 
also contribute to the corticospinal tract.
Neurotransmitters
Acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid (–), and substance P (+, plus other 
peptides) are found in small cortical neurons presumed to function 
as local circuit cells or in cortico-cortical connections. Glutamate (+) 
is present in cortical efferent ﬁbers that project to the spinal cord. 
Glutaminergic corticospinal ﬁbers and terminals are found in all spi-
nal levels, but are especially concentrated in cervical and lumbosacral 
enlargements. This correlates with the fact that approximately 55% of 
all corticospinal ﬁbers terminate in cervical levels of the spinal cord, 
approximately 20% in thoracic levels, and approximately 25% in lum-
bosacral levels. Some corticospinal ﬁbers may branch and terminate at 
multiple spinal levels. Lower motor neurons are inﬂuenced by corticos-
pinal ﬁbers, either directly or indirectly, via interneurons. Acetylcholine 
and calcitonin gene–related peptides are present in these large motor 
cells and in their endings in skeletal muscle.
Clinical Correlations
Myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by moderate to profound 
weakness of skeletal muscles, is caused by circulating antibodies that 
react with postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Progressive 
8-11
muscle fatigability throughout the day is a hallmark of this disease. Ocu-
lar muscles are affected ﬁrst in about 45% of patients (diplopia, ptosis) 
and ultimately in about 85% of individuals. In over 50% of patients, 
facial and oropharyngeal muscles are commonly affected (facial weak-
ness, dysphagia, dysarthria). Weakness also may be seen in limb mus-
cles, but almost always in combination with facial/oral weaknesses.
Injury to corticospinal ﬁbers on one side of the cervical spinal cord 
(e.g., the Brown-Séquard syndrome) results in paralysis (hemiple-
gia) of the ipsilateral upper and lower extremities. With time, these 
patients may also exhibit features of an upper motor neuron lesion 
(hyperreﬂexia, spasticity, loss of superﬁcial abdominal reﬂexes, and 
the Babinski sign). Bilateral cord damage above C4–C5 may result in 
quadriplegia; at C1–C2, respiratory arrest is an additional complica-
tion. Unilateral cord lesions in thoracic levels may result in paralysis of 
the ipsilateral lower extremity (monoplegia). If the thoracic spinal cord 
damage is bilateral both lower extremities may be paralyzed (paraple-
gia). Small lesions within the decussation of the pyramids may result in 
a bilateral paresis of the upper extremities (lesion in rostral portions) or 
a bilateral paresis of the lower extremities (lesion in caudal portions) 
based on the crossing patterns of ﬁbers within the decussation. Recall 
that -plegia, as in hemiplegia, refers to a paralysis whereas -paresis, as in 
hemiparesis, refers to a weakness or incomplete paralysis.
Rostral to the pyramidal decussation, vascular lesions in the medulla 
(the medial medullary syndrome or Déjèrine syndrome), pons (the  
Millard-Gubler or Foville syndromes), or midbrain (the Weber syn-
drome) all produce crossed (alternate or alternating) hemiplegias. These 
present as a contralateral hemiplegia of the upper and lower extremi-
ties, coupled with an ipsilateral paralysis of the tongue (medulla), facial 
muscles or lateral rectus muscle (pons), and most eye movements (mid-
brain). Sensory deﬁcits are frequently seen as part of these syndromes. 
Lesions in the internal capsule (lacunar strokes) produce contralateral 
hemiparesis sometimes coupled with various cranial nerve signs due to 
corticonuclear ﬁber involvement. Bilateral weakness, indicative of cor-
ticospinal involvement, is also present in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

corticospinal system and the deﬁcits (in pink boxes) that 
correlate with the level and laterality of each lesion. Note that the

laterality (R/L) of the deﬁcits is determined by whether the lesion is on

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Corticonuclear Fibers in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and distribution of corticonuclear ﬁbers 
to brainstem motor nuclei. These ﬁbers inﬂuence—either 
directly or through neurons in the immediately adjacent reticular for-
mation—the motor nuclei of oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, abdu-
cens, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus (both via nucleus ambiguus), 
accessory, and hypoglossal nerves.
Corticonuclear ﬁbers arise in the frontal eye ﬁelds (areas 6 and 8 
in caudal portions of the middle frontal gyrus), the precentral gyrus 
(somatomotor cortex, area 4), and some originate from the postcentral 
gyrus (areas 3, 1, and 2). Fibers from area 4 occupy the genu of the 
internal capsule, but those from the frontal eye ﬁelds (areas 8 and 6) 
may traverse caudal portions of the anterior limb, and some (from areas 
3, 1, and 2) may occupy the most rostral portions of the posterior limb. 
Fibers that arise in areas 8 and 6 terminate in the rostral interstitial 
nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (vertical gaze center) and 
the paramedian pontine reticular formation (horizontal gaze center); 
these areas, in turn, project respectively to the third, fourth, and sixth 
nuclei. Fibers from area 4 terminate in, or adjacent to, cranial nerve 
motor nuclei excluding those of III, IV, and VI.
Although not illustrated here, the superior colliculus receives corti-
cal input from area 8 and from the parietal eye ﬁeld (area 7) and also 
projects to the riMLF and PPRF. In addition, note that descending cor-
tical ﬁbers (many arising in areas 3, 1, and 2) project to sensory relay 
nuclei of some cranial nerves and to other sensory relay nuclei in the 
brainstem.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+) is found in many corticofugal axons that directly inner-
vate cranial nerve motor nuclei and in those ﬁbers that terminate near, 
but not in, the various motor nuclei (indirect).
Clinical Correlations
Lesions involving the motor cortex (e.g., cerebral artery occlusion) or 
the internal capsule (e.g., lacunar strokes or occlusion of lenticulostriate 
branches of M1) give rise to a contralateral hemiplegia of the upper and 
8-13
lower extremities (corticospinal ﬁber involvement) coupled with certain 
cranial nerve signs. Strictly cortical lesions may produce a transient gaze 
palsy in which the eyes deviate toward the lesioned side and away from 
the side of the hemiplegia. In addition to a contralateral hemiplegia, 
common cranial nerve ﬁndings in capsular lesions may include: 1) devi-
ation of the tongue toward the side of the weakness and away from the 
side of the lesion when protruded; and 2) paralysis of facial muscles on 
the contralateral lower half of the face (central facial palsy). This reﬂects 
the fact that corticonuclear ﬁbers to genioglossus motor neurons and to 
facial motor neurons serving the lower face are primarily crossed. Inter-
ruption of corticonuclear ﬁbers to the nucleus ambiguus may result in 
weakness of palatal muscles contralateral to the lesion; the uvula will 
deviate toward the ipsilateral (lesioned) side on attempted phonation. 
In addition, a lesion involving corticonuclear ﬁbers to the accessory 
nucleus may result in drooping of the ipsilateral shoulder (or an inabil-
ity to elevate the shoulder against resistance) due to trapezius weakness, 
and difﬁculty in turning the head (against resistance) to the contralat-
eral side due to weakness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. In con-
trast to the crossed (alternating) hemiplegia characteristic of brainstem 
lesions, hemisphere lesions result in spinal and cranial nerve deﬁcits that 
are generally, but not exclusively, contralateral to the cerebral injury.
Brainstem lesions, especially in the midbrain or pons, may result 
in the following: 1) vertical gaze palsies (midbrain); 2) the Parin-
aud syndrome—paralysis of upward gaze (tumors in area of pineal);  
3) internuclear ophthalmoplegia (lesion in the MLF between motor 
nuclei of III and VI); 4) horizontal gaze palsies (lesion in abducens 
nucleus + PPRF); or 5) the one-and-a-half syndrome (see also Figure 
3-8 and Table 3-2, pp. 53–54). In the latter case, the lesion is adjacent 
to the midline and involves mainly the abducens nucleus, internuclear 
ﬁbers from the ipsilateral abducens that are crossing to enter the con-
tralateral MLF, and internuclear ﬁbers from the contralateral abducens 
nucleus that cross to enter the MLF on the ipsilateral (lesioned) side. 
The result is a loss of ipsilateral abduction (lateral rectus) and adduc-
tion (medial rectus, the “one”) and a contralateral loss of adduction 
(medial rectus, the “half”); the only remaining horizontal movement is 
contralateral abduction via the intact abducens motor neurons.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Tectospinal and Reticulospinal Tracts in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and position in representative cross sec-
tions of brainstem and spinal cord, and the general distribu-
tion of tectospinal and reticulospinal tracts. Tectospinal ﬁbers originate 
from deeper layers of the superior colliculus, cross in the posterior (dor-
sal) tegmental decussation, and distribute to cervical cord levels. Several 
regions of cerebral cortex (e.g., frontal, parietal, temporal) project to the 
tectum, but the most highly organized corticotectal projections arise 
from the visual cortex. Pontoreticulospinal ﬁbers (medial reticulospinal) 
tend to be uncrossed, whereas those from the medulla (bulboreticulospi-
nal or lateral reticulospinal) are bilateral, but with a pronounced ipsilat-
eral preponderance. Corticoreticular ﬁbers are bilateral with a slight 
contralateral preponderance and originate from several cortical areas.
Neurotransmitters
Corticotectal projections, especially those from the visual cortex, use 
glutamate (+). This substance is also present in most corticoreticular ﬁb-
ers. Some neurons of the gigantocellular reticular nucleus that send their 
axons to the spinal cord, as reticulospinal projections, contain enkepha-
lin (–) and substance P (+). Enkephalinergic reticulospinal ﬁbers may be 
part of the descending system that modulates pain transmission at the 
spinal level. Many reticulospinal ﬁbers inﬂuence the activity of lower 
motor neurons.
8-15
Clinical Correlations
Isolated lesions of only tectospinal and reticulospinal ﬁbers are essen-
tially never seen. Tectospinal ﬁbers project to upper cervical levels 
where they inﬂuence reﬂex movement of the head and neck. Such move-
ments may be diminished or slowed in patients with damage to these 
ﬁbers. Pontoreticulospinal (medial reticulospinal) ﬁbers are excitatory 
to extensor motor neurons and to neurons innervating axial muscu-
lature; some of these ﬁbers also may inhibit ﬂexor motor neurons. In 
contrast, some bulboreticulospinal (lateral reticulospinal) ﬁbers are pri-
marily inhibitory to extensor motor neurons and neurons innervating 
muscles of the neck and back; these ﬁbers also may excite ﬂexor motor 
neurons via interneurons.
Reticulospinal (and vestibulospinal) ﬁbers contribute to the spastic-
ity that develops in patients having lesions of corticospinal ﬁbers. These 
ﬁbers, particularly reticulospinal ﬁbers, also contribute to the tonic 
extension of the arms and legs seen in decerebrate rigidity when spinal 
motor neurons are released from descending cortical control. The sud-
den increase in extensor rigidity, seen in decerebrate patients when a 
noxious stimulus is applied to, for example, the skin between the toes, 
is mediated via spinoreticular ﬁbers (traveling in the ALS) that end on 
reticulospinal neurons whose axons descend to increase the level of 
excitation to extensor motor neurons.

8-15 Tectospinal and Reticulospinal Tracts in Anatomical Orientation

 8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Rubrospinal and Vestibulospinal Tracts in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and position in representative cross sec-
tions of brainstem and spinal cord, and the general distribu-
tion of rubrospinal and vestibulospinal tracts. Rubrospinal ﬁbers cross in 
the anterior (ventral) tegmental decussation and distribute to all spinal 
levels, although projections to cervical levels clearly predominate. Cells in 
dorsomedial regions of the red nucleus receive input from upper extrem-
ity areas of the motor cortex and project to cervical levels, but those in 
ventrolateral areas of the nucleus receive some ﬁbers from lower extrem-
ity areas of the motor cortex and may project in sparse numbers to lum-
bosacral levels. The red nucleus also projects, via the central tegmental 
tract, to the ipsilateral inferior olivary complex (rubro-olivary ﬁbers).
Medial and lateral vestibular nuclei give rise to the medial and lateral 
vestibulospinal tracts, respectively. The former tract is primarily ipsilat-
eral, projects to upper spinal levels, and is considered a component of 
the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the spinal cord. The latter tract is 
ipsilateral and somatotopically organized; ﬁbers to lumbosacral levels 
originate from dorsal and caudal regions of the lateral nucleus, whereas 
those to cervical levels arise from its rostral and more ventral areas.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+) is present in corticorubral ﬁbers. Some lateral vestibu-
lospinal ﬁbers contain aspartate (+), whereas glycine (–) is present in a 
portion of the medial vestibulospinal projection. There are numerous γ-
aminobutyric acid (–)-containing ﬁbers in the vestibular complex; these 
represent the endings of cerebellar corticovestibular ﬁbers.
Clinical Correlations
Isolated injury to rubrospinal and vestibulospinal ﬁbers is really not 
seen in humans. Deﬁcits in ﬁne distal limb movements seen in monkeys  
8-16
following experimental rubrospinal lesions may be present in humans. 
However, these deﬁcits are overshadowed by the hemiplegia associ-
ated with injury to the adjacent corticospinal ﬁbers. The rubral tremor 
(Holmes tremor) and the cerebellar ataxia/tremor (all predominately 
contralateral), as seen in patients with the Claude syndrome (a lesion 
of the medial midbrain), is related to damage to the red nucleus and 
the adjacent cerebellothalamic ﬁbers, respectively. These patients 
also may have a paucity of most eye movement on the ipsilateral side 
and a dilated pupil (oculomotor palsy and mydriasis) due to concur-
rent damage to exiting rootlets of the oculomotor nerve. The sudden 
increase in extensor rigidity, seen in decerebrate patients when a nox-
ious stimulus is applied to, for example, the skin between the toes, is 
mediated via spinoreticular ﬁbers (traveling in the ALS) that end on 
reticulospinal neurons whose axons descend to excite extensor motor 
neurons.
Medial vestibulospinal ﬁbers primarily inhibit motor neurons inner-
vating extensors and neurons serving muscles of the back and neck. 
Lateral vestibulospinal ﬁbers may inhibit some ﬂexor motor neurons, 
but they mainly facilitate spinal reﬂexes via their excitatory inﬂuence on 
spinal motor neurons innervating extensors. Vestibulospinal and reticu-
lospinal (see Figure 8-17 on pp. 222–223) ﬁbers contribute to the spas-
ticity seen in patients with damage to corticospinal ﬁbers or to the tonic 
extension of the extremities in patients with decerebrate rigidity. In the 
case of decerebrate rigidity, the descending inﬂuences on spinal ﬂexor 
motor neurons (corticospinal, rubrospinal) are removed; the descending 
brainstem inﬂuence on spinal extensor motor neurons predominates; 
this is augmented by excitatory spinoreticular input (via ALS) to some 
of the centers giving rise to reticulospinal ﬁbers (see also Figure 8-15 on 
pp. 218–219). See Figure 8-17 for lesions that inﬂuence the activity of 
rubrospinal and reticulospinal ﬁbers.

Representative lesions in the forebrain that are supratento-
rial (located above the tentorial notch) and then extend 
downward through the notch and become infratentorial. These lesions 
alter the activity of rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, and reticulospinal ﬁb-
ers that results in the characteristic deﬁcit (in pink boxes) seen in these 
patients. In a large supratentorial lesion (decorticate), all brainstem 
8-17B
nuclei (including the red nucleus) are intact. When the lesion becomes 
infratentorial, the red nucleus inﬂuence is removed, the extensor rigidity 
predominates and the patient becomes decerebrate. This extensor pos-
turing is, exacerbated by incoming signals from the anterolateral sys-
tem; the decerebrate posturing is increased during stimulation. See 
Chapter 9 for additional information on herniation syndromes.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Cranial Nerves
Cranial Nerve Efferents (III, IV, VI, XI–AccNu, XII) in Anatomical Orientation
The origin and peripheral distribution of GSE or SE ﬁbers 
from the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, accessory, and 
hypoglossal nuclei. Edinger-Westphal cells adjacent to the oculomotor 
nucleus are organized into the Edinger-Westphal centrally projecting 
nucleus (EWcpNu) and the Edinger-Westphal preganglionic nucleus 
(EWpgNu). Neurons of the EWcpNu project to the spinal cord and a 
variety of brainstem nuclei (such as parabrachial, inferior olivary, dor-
sal raphe) that are involved in stress and food/drink intake behaviors. 
Neurons of the EWpgNu are the origin of the VE preganglionic para-
sympathetic input to the ciliary ganglion traveling on the third nerve; 
this is part of the pupillary light reﬂex pathway. Internuclear abducens 
neurons (in green) project, via the MLF, to contralateral oculomotor 
neurons that innervate the medial rectus muscle (internuclear ophthal-
moplegia pathway).
The trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles originate from cervi-
cal somites located caudal to the last pharyngeal arch; they are desig-
nated here as SE. In addition, the motor neurons innervating these same 
muscles are found in cervical cord levels C1 to about C6.
Neurotransmitters
Acetylcholine (and probably calcitonin gene–related peptide, CGRP) is 
found in the motor neurons of cranial nerve nuclei and in their periph-
eral endings. This substance is also found in cells of the Edinger-West-
phal preganglionic nucleus and the ciliary ganglion.
Clinical Correlations
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease caused by autoantibodies that may 
directly block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or damage the postsyn-
aptic membrane (via complement-mediated lysis) thereby reducing the 
number of viable receptor sites. Ocular movement disorders (diplopia, 
ptosis) are the initial deﬁcits observed in approximately 50% of patients 
and are present in approximately 85% of all MG patients. Movements 
of the neck and tongue also may be impaired, with the latter contribut-
ing to dysphagia and dysarthria.
8-19
The patient who presents with: 1) ptosis; 2) lateral and downward 
deviation of the eye; and 3) diplopia (except on ipsilateral lateral gaze) 
may have a lesion of third nerve (e.g., as in the Weber syndrome or in a 
carotid cavernous aneurysm). In addition, the pupil may be unaffected 
(pupillary sparing) or dilated and ﬁxed. Lesions in the midbrain that 
involve the root of the third nerve and the crus cerebri give rise to a 
superior crossed (alternating) hemiplegia. This is an ipsilateral paralysis 
of most eye movement and a dilated pupil on the ipsilateral side and a 
contralateral hemiplegia of the extremities.
Damage to the MLF (e.g., multiple sclerosis or small vessel occlusion) 
between the sixth and third nuclei results in internuclear ophthalmople-
gia; on attempted lateral gaze, the opposite medial rectus muscle will 
not adduct. A lesion of the fourth nerve (frequently caused by trauma) 
produces diplopia on downward and inward gaze (tilting the head may 
give some relief), and the eye is slightly elevated when the patient looks 
straight ahead.
Diabetes mellitus, trauma, or pontine gliomas are some causes of 
sixth nerve dysfunction. In these patients, the affected eye is slightly 
adducted, and diplopia is pronounced on attempted gaze to the lesioned 
side. Damage in the caudal and medial pons may involve the ﬁbers of 
the sixth nerve and the adjacent corticospinal ﬁbers in the basilar pons, 
giving rise to a middle crossed (alternating) hemiplegia. The deﬁcits are 
an ipsilateral paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle and a contralateral 
hemiplegia of the extremities. The eleventh nerve may be damaged cen-
trally (e.g., syringobulbia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or at the 
jugular foramen with resultant paralysis of the ipsilateral sternocleido-
mastoid and upper parts of the trapezius muscle.
Central injury to the twelfth nucleus or ﬁbers (e.g., the medial med-
ullary syndrome or in syringobulbia) or to its peripheral parts (e.g., 
polyneuropathy, trauma, or tumor) results in deviation of the tongue 
toward the lesioned side on attempted protrusion. A lesion in the medial 
aspects of the medulla will give rise to an inferior crossed (alternating) 
hemiplegia. This is characterized by a paralysis of the ipsilateral side of 
the tongue (twelfth root damage) and contralateral hemiplegia of the 
extremities (damage to corticospinal ﬁbers in the pyramid).

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Cranial Nerve Efferents (V, VII, IX, and X) in Anatomical Orientation
The origin and peripheral distribution of ﬁbers arising from 
the motor nuclei of the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyn-
geal and vagus (via the nucleus ambiguus) nerves. Also shown is the 
origin of GVE or VE preganglionic parasympathetic ﬁbers from the 
superior (to facial nerve) and inferior (to glossopharyngeal nerve) saliv-
atory nuclei and from the dorsal motor vagal nucleus. The functional 
component for cranial nerve motor nuclei innervating muscles arising 
from pharyngeal arches may be classiﬁed as SE neurons (see Figures 6-1 
and 6-2 on pp. 96–97). Muscles innervated by the trigeminal nerve (V) 
come from the ﬁrst arch, those served by the facial nerve (VII) from the 
second arch; the stylopharyngeal muscle originates from the third arch 
and is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), and the muscles 
derived from the fourth arch are served by the vagus nerve (X).
Neurotransmitters
The transmitter found in the cells of cranial nerve motor nuclei, and in 
their peripheral endings, is acetylcholine; calcitonin gene–related peptide 
(CGRP) is also colocalized in these motor neurons. This substance is also 
present in preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons.
Clinical Correlations
Patients with myasthenia gravis frequently have oropharyngeal symp-
toms and complications that result in dysarthria, and dysphagia. These 
individuals have difﬁculty chewing and swallowing, their jaw may hang 
open, and the mobility of facial muscles is decreased. Impaired hearing 
(weakness of tensor tympani) and hyperacusis (increased hearing sensi-
tivity caused by weakness of the stapedius muscle) also may be present.
Symptoms of: 1) a loss of pain, temperature, and touch on the ipsi-
lateral face and in the oral and nasal cavities; 2) paralysis of ipsilateral 
masticatory muscles (jaw deviates to the lesioned side when closed); and 
3) loss of the afferent limb of the corneal reﬂex may specify damage to 
the ﬁfth nerve (e.g., meningioma, trauma). If especially large, a vestibu-
lar schwannoma may compress the trigeminal nerve root and result in 
8-21
a hemifacial sensory loss that may include the oral cavity. Trigeminal 
neuralgia (tic douloureux) is an intense, sudden, intermittent pain in the 
area of the cheek, oral cavity, or adjacent parts of the nose (distribution 
of V2 or V3, see also Figure 8-7 on p. 202). One cause is an aberrant 
loop of the superior cerebellar artery impinging on the trigeminal root 
(see Figure 3-4, p. 49).
Tumors (e.g., chordoma or vestibular schwannoma), trauma, or 
meningitis may damage the seventh nerve, resulting in: 1) an ipsilateral 
facial palsy (or Bell palsy); 2) loss of taste from the ipsilateral two-thirds 
of the tongue; and 3) decreased secretion from the ipsilateral lacrimal, 
nasal, and sublingual and submandibular glands. Injury distal to the 
chorda tympani produces only an ipsilateral facial palsy. A paralysis of 
the muscles on one side of the face with no paralysis of the extremities 
is a facial hemiplegia, whereas intermittent and involuntary contraction 
of the facial muscles is called hemifacial spasm. One cause of hemifacial 
spasm is compression of the facial root by an aberrant loop from the 
anterior inferior cerebellar artery. These patients also may have vertigo, 
tinnitus, or hearing loss suggesting involvement of the adjacent vestibu-
locochlear nerve.
Because of their common origin from NuAm, adjacent exit from the 
medulla, and passage through the jugular foramen, the ninth and tenth 
nerves may be damaged together (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or 
in syringobulbia). The results are dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnea, loss 
of taste from the ipsilateral caudal tongue, and loss of the gag reﬂex. 
Damage to structures at, or traversing, the jugular foramen results in 
combinations of deﬁcits called jugular foramen syndromes. Internal to 
the foramen, the deﬁcits may reﬂect injury to CNs IX, X (described 
above), and XI (ipsilateral trapezius and sternocleidomastoid weak-
ness), the Vernet syndrome, while a lesion immediately external to the 
foramen may compromise CNs IX to XI plus XII (Collet-Sicard syn-
drome). In this latter case, along with the other deﬁcits, the tongue will 
deviate to the side of the lesion on protrusion. Bilateral lesions of the 
tenth nerve may be life-threatening because of the resultant total paraly-
sis (and closure) of the muscles in the vocal folds (vocalis muscle).

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Spinal and Cranial Nerve Reflexes
Spinal and Cranial Nerve Reflexes
Examining reﬂexes is an essential part of any neurological examina-
tion because it provides information critical to the diagnosis of the 
neurologically compromised patient. All reﬂexes have an afferent limb 
(usually a primary sensory ﬁber with a cell body in a ganglion) and an 
efferent limb (usually a ﬁber innervating skeletal muscle) originating 
from a motor nucleus. The afferent ﬁber may synapse directly on the 
efferent neuron, in which case it is a monosynaptic reﬂex, or there may 
be one, or more, interneurons insinuated between the afferent and effer-
ent limbs; these are polysynaptic reﬂexes. In many reﬂexes, the inﬂuence 
on the motor neuron may be both monosynaptic and polysynaptic. In 
the case of cranial nerves, polysynaptic reﬂexes may also be mediated 
through the immediately adjacent reticular formation of the brainstem.
The primary sensory ﬁber is regarded as the ﬁrst-order neuron in a 
pathway. Although the ﬁrst-order neuron may participate in a reﬂex, it 
also contributes information to ascending pathways. The primary sen-
sory ﬁber may synapse directly on a tract cell, or may communicate 
through interneurons. In either case, this tract cell is regarded as the 
second order neuron in the pathway.
Spinal reﬂexes may rely on sensory/afferent information that 
arises from the body, enters the spinal cord, inﬂuences lower motor 
neurons, and results in an appropriate response. The same principle 
applies to cranial nerve reﬂexes. The afferent input enters the brain-
stem on a cranial nerve and may inﬂuence motor neurons, and the 
efferent outﬂow exits the brainstem on the same, or another, cranial 
nerve. Because of these structural/functional features, the reﬂex path-
ways are placed at this location in Chapter 8, following “Sensory 
and Motor Pathways and Cranial Nerves.” The circuits for the more 
routinely tested reﬂexes are described; this is not intended as an all-
inclusive list.
Particularly brisk or hyperactive reﬂexes, commonly demonstrated 
in muscle stretch reﬂexes, are speciﬁed as hyperreﬂexia. Decreased or 
hypoactive reﬂexes are described as hyporeﬂexia. A complete absence of 
reﬂex activity is areﬂexia. These deviations from normal may be seen in 
spinal reﬂexes as well as in cranial nerve reﬂexes. The aberrations from 
normal reﬂex activity may indicate peripheral nerve disease or injury/
disease of the brainstem, spinal cord, or forebrain.

The muscle stretch reﬂex (also called a stretch or myotatic 
reﬂex) is sometimes incorrectly called a tendon reﬂex or deep 
tendon reﬂex (these are clear misnomers); the receptor for this reﬂex is 
the muscle spindle (within the muscle itself, hence muscle stretch reﬂex). 
The afferent limb is activated by tapping the tendon of a muscle and 
momentarily stretching muscle spindles (primary or secondary) within 
the muscle. These action potentials are propagated on A-alpha (13–20 
mm in diameter, 80–120 m/s conduction velocity) or A-beta (6–12 mm, 
35–75 m/s) ﬁbers. Their cell bodies are in posterior root ganglia; these 
ﬁbers monosynaptically excite motor neurons innervating the muscle 
from which the afferent volley arose, and the muscle contracts, 
8-23
precipitating the reﬂex. Collaterals of the afferent axons synapse on 
interneurons that, in turn, inhibit motor neurons innervating antagonis-
tic muscles.
Muscle stretch reﬂexes test the functional integrity of different spinal 
levels. Examples of these reﬂexes, and their corresponding levels are: 
triceps (C7–C8), biceps (C5–C6), brachioradialis (C5–C6), Achilles/
ankle jerk (S1), patellar/knee jerk (L2–L4), and the ﬁnger ﬂexor (C7–
C8). Concurrent with the reﬂex, the central processes send ascending 
collaterals that relay information to the nuclei gracilis or cuneatus, 
depending on the level of the input, and the sensation is perceived. The 
patellar reﬂex is shown here.

The nociceptive reﬂex (also called a withdrawal reﬂex or 
ﬂexor reﬂex) is activated by tissue damage; action potentials 
are propagated on A-delta (1–5 mm in diameter, 5–30 m/s conduction 
velocity) and C (0.2–5.0 mm, 0.5–2 m/s) ﬁbers. These afferent ﬁbers have 
cell bodies in the posterior root ganglion and they terminate on inhibitory 
and/or excitatory spinal interneurons. When a patient steps on a nail, 
8-24
ﬂexor motor neurons of the lower extremity are excited, extensor motor 
neurons of the LE are inhibited, and the extremity is pulled away from 
the noxious stimulus. The same arrangement of circuits applies when the 
hand encounters a noxious stimulus and the upper extremity is with-
drawn. Concurrent with this reﬂex, the recognition of pain is achieved 
via second order neurons that ascend in the ALS of the spinal cord.

The crossed extension reﬂex affects extremities on both sides 
of the body. The afferent ﬁbers, their input to spinal interneu-
rons, and their respective action (excitatory/inhibitory) on ﬂexor and 
extensor spinal motor neurons on the side of the noxious stimulus is the 
same as in the nociceptive reﬂex (see Figure 8-24). The stimulus occurs 
and the extremity on that side is withdrawn. In an effort to maintain 
8-25
stability, when an injured foot is withdrawn on the side of the stimulus, 
the opposite LE is extended. Consequently, on the side opposite the 
stimulus, ﬂexor motor neurons are inhibited and extensor motor neu-
rons are excited and the relative posture of the patient is maintained. 
This reﬂex also gives rise to ascending information that reaches a con-
scious level of perception.

The abdominal reﬂex is a cutaneous reﬂex; the afferent limb 
arises from receptors on A-delta and C ﬁbers. It is mediated 
through lower thoracic spinal levels (T8–T11) and is activated by 
lightly stroking the abdomen about 4–5 cm lateral to, and parallel with, 
the midline. The afferent ﬁbers enter the posterior root and synapse on 
interneurons. Some of these are excitatory interneurons that, in turn, 
excite lower motor neurons that innervate the abdominal musculature; 
the muscles of the abdomen contract and the trunk ﬂexes slightly. Other 
8-26
interneurons inhibit the alpha motor neurons that are innervating deep 
back muscles; inactivation of these motor neurons decreases the tension 
in the deep back muscles and increases the efﬁcacy of the abdominal 
reﬂex. These deep back muscles extend the trunk. A normal response is 
occurring when the abdominal muscles contract and the umbilicus 
rotates slightly to the stimulated side. The sensations created by strok-
ing the abdominal wall will also enter ascending spinal cord pathways 
and are consciously perceived.

The corneal reﬂex (also called the lid reﬂex) has its afferent 
limb in the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and its efferent limb in 
the facial nerve (CN VII). An irritating stimulus to the cornea activates 
C ﬁbers, the cell bodies of which are in the trigeminal ganglion. These 
axons enter the brainstem on the trigeminal nerve, descend in the spinal 
trigeminal tract, and terminate in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, pars 
caudalis. Pars caudalis neurons project to the contralateral ventral pos-
teromedial thalamic nucleus and, en route, send collaterals to the facial 
8-27
motor nucleus bilaterally; the facial response is generally more active on 
the side of the stimulation. Axons of the motor neurons in the facial 
nucleus exit in the facial nerve to eventually exit the skull via the stylo-
mastoid foramen. Axons in the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve 
innervate the orbicularis oculi muscle and the eyelids close in response 
to a noxious stimulus of the cornea. The noxious information being 
relayed via ascending ﬁbers eventually reaches conscious perception via 
anterior trigeminothalamic ﬁbers.

The jaw jerk reﬂex (also called the jaw jerk or mandibular 
reﬂex) is a cranial nerve version of a spinal muscle stretch reﬂex; 
this reﬂex is mediated through the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The axons of 
the afferent limb synapse on the motor neurons that innervate skeletal 
muscles (it is a monosynaptic reﬂex). A gentle tap on the chin stretches 
muscle spindles in the temporalis and masseter muscles, initiating action 
potentials on A-alpha (primary muscle spindles) and A-beta (secondary 
muscle spindles) ﬁbers. These ﬁbers enter the brain on the sensory root of 
8-28
the trigeminal nerve, and have their primary afferent cell bodies in the mes-
encephalic nucleus. Collaterals of these afferent ﬁbers project directly, and 
bilaterally, to the trigeminal motor nucleus; axons of these motor cells exit 
via the motor root of the trigeminal nerve to innervate the temporalis and 
masseter muscles, resulting in jaw closure in response to the tap on the chin. 
This information also reaches a conscious level: the patient perceives the 
tap on the chin. The jaw-jerk reﬂex is often increased/brisk (hyper-
reﬂexia) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

There are a variety of reﬂexes in which sensory input results 
in a visceral motor response. Examples are the lacrimal (tear-
ing) and the salivatory reﬂexes. The lacrimal reﬂex is used here as an 
example of a somato-visceral reﬂex. The afferent limb is activated by 
stimulation of C ﬁbers and A-delta receptors/ﬁbers in the cornea and 
sclera. This afferent message enters the brainstem on the trigeminal 
nerve (cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion), descends within the spi-
nal trigeminal tract, and synapses in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, pars 
caudalis. Collaterals of ascending trigeminothalamic ﬁbers (en route to 
8-29
the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus) synapse in the superior 
salivatory nucleus (SSN) either directly (shown here) or through 
interneurons. Parasympathtic preganglionic ﬁbers from the SSN exit 
on the facial nerve, travel to the pterygopalatine ganglion, where they 
synapse, and the postganglionic ﬁbers course to the lacrimal gland and 
to mucous membranes of the nose. A nocuous stimulus to the cornea 
results in tearing and increased nasal secretions and the discomfort is 
perceived through ascending ﬁbers that eventually inﬂuence the sensory 
cortex.

The gag reﬂex (also called the faucial reﬂex) is mediated 
through the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and the vagus (CN X) 
nerves. The afferent limb is activated by cutaneous stimulation of 
A-delta and probably C ﬁbers on the caudal base of the tongue and/or 
caudal roof of the mouth (soft palate). This space between the mouth 
and pharynx is the fauces, hence the term faucial reﬂex. The afferent limb 
is via CN IX with its cell bodies in the superior ganglion of CN IX; the 
8-30
central terminations are in the nucleus ambiguus, either directly or through 
interneurons (both shown here). The efferent limb from the nucleus 
ambiguus travels on CNs IX and X to the stylopharyngeus muscle (via 
IX), to the pharyngeal constricter muscles, and to muscles that move the 
palate (via X). In response to irritation in the caudal oral cavity, the phar-
ynx constricts and elevates in an attempt to extrude the offending object, 
and the discomfort is perceived through pathways to the cerebral cortex.

There are a variety of reﬂexes seen in infants mediated by CNs 
V, VII, IX, or XI and XII. Examples of these are the snout, 
sucking, and rooting reﬂexes; they usually disappear by about 1 year of 
age. These are commonly referred to as “primitive reﬂexes.” However, 
these reﬂexes may reappear in patients with dementia, or in individuals 
with degenerative diseases, or dysfunction, of the frontal lobe.
The afferent limb for these reﬂexes is via CN V and is activated by 
touching around (snout, rooting), or in (sucking), the mouth opening. 
These afferent ﬁbers enter the brainstem via CN V and have cell bodies in 
the trigeminal ganglion. They terminate in the spinal trigeminal nucleus 
(information relayed on A-delta ﬁbers from free nerve endings) and in the 
principal sensory nucleus (information relayed on A-beta ﬁbers from end-
ings such as Meissner corpuscles and Merkel cell complexes).
8-31
Secondary trigeminal ﬁbers, en route to the ventral posteromedial 
nucleus of the thalamus from both the spinal trigeminal and principal 
sensory nuclei, send collaterals to the facial nucleus, the nucleus ambig-
uus, the accessory nucleus, and the hypoglossal nucleus, either directly, 
or via interneurons located in the reticular formation (only the direct 
are shown here). In response to stimulation around, or in, the mouth 
opening, the infant’s facial muscles respond (via the facial nucleus), the 
head orients toward or away from the source of the stimulus (accessory 
nucleus), the laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles contract during sucking 
(nucleus ambiguus), and the tongue moves in and out of the mouth or 
protrudes toward the stimulus (hypoglossal nucleus). These reﬂexes are 
absolutely essential to survival (orienting toward nutrition, sucking, 
tongue and facial muscle responses).

The pupillary light reﬂex (also called the pupillary reﬂex or 
light reﬂex) has its afferent limb in the optic nerve (CN II) and 
its efferent limb in the oculomotor nerve (CN III). Light shined in the 
eye results in the neural activity conveyed on ﬁbers of the optic nerve, 
optic chiasm (where some cross), optic tract, and the brachium of the 
superior colliculus, which synapse bilaterally in the pretectal area/
nucleus.
The Edinger-Westphal complex consists of two portions both of 
which are immediately adjacent to the oculomotor nucleus (see Figure 
6-28 on p. 148). The Edinger-Westphal centrally projecting nucleus 
(EWcpNu) projects to a number of central targets such as the spinal 
cord, posterior column, parabrachial, trigeminal, and facial nuclei, but 
not to the ciliary ganglion. The Edinger-Westphal preganglionic nucleus 
(EWpgNu) preferentially projects to the ciliary ganglion; these EWpgNu 
cells are the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons of the third cranial 
nerve. After receipt of retinal input via the above pathway, both pretec-
tal areas project bilaterally to the EWpgNu. In turn, the EWpgNu sends 
parasympathetic preganglionic ﬁbers on the ipsilateral oculomoter 
nerve to the ciliary ganglion, which in turn sends postganglionic ﬁbers, 
as short ciliary nerves, to the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris. In the 
normal patient, light shined in one eye will result in a pupillary reﬂex in 
that eye (direct response) and in the opposite eye (consensual response).
Example One: In the case of a patient with previously diagnosed 
retinitis pigmentosa and absolutely no perception of light in that eye, 
when a light is shined in the blind eye, the patient has a direct and 
consensual pupillary light reﬂex. The explanation of this response is 
that there is a small population (<1%) of melanopsin-containing gan-
glion cells in the retina that are characterized by large cell bodies and 
8-32
expansive dentritic ﬁelds. These cells are intrinsically sensitive to light, 
do not rely on input from rods or cones, and project to central targets 
such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the EWpgNu. Melanopsin gan-
glion cells do not appear to participate in form recognition (vision, actu-
ally seeing/recognizing things in visual space). Their presence not only 
explains the pupillary reﬂex in a blind eye, but is the likely explanation 
of the fact that patients blind in both eyes may have reasonably normal 
circadian rhythms.
Example Two: In the case of a patient with a lesion of the optic nerve 
and a light is shined in the eye on the lesioned side, this patient perceives 
no light in that eye, both the direct and consensual pupillary responses 
are absent, and the afferent limb of the reﬂex is interrupted. In this 
example, there is no input to either pretectal area from the eye on the 
side with the optic nerve lesion.
Example Three: In the case of a patient with a lesion of one optic 
nerve and a light is shined in the eye opposite the side of the lesion (the 
good eye), this patient perceives the light in this eye, and there is both 
a direct and consensual response. In this example, the afferent limb to 
both pretectal nuclei is intact, and there is a response in the blind eye 
because its efferent limb is intact.
Example Four: In the case of a patient with a lesion of the oculomo-
tor nerve on one side and a light is shined in the eye on the side of the 
lesion, the patient perceives the light (the afferent limb is intact) but 
there is no direct response in that eye; the efferent limb is interrupted 
by the lesion. There is a consensual response in the opposite eye in this 
situation. If the light is shined in the eye on the side opposite the oculo-
motor root lesion, the light is perceived, and there is a direct response 
but no consensual response.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Cerebellum and Basal Nuclei
Spinocerebellar Tracts in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and distribution pattern of ﬁbers to the 
cerebellar cortex and nuclei from the spinal cord (posterior 
[dorsal] and anterior [ventral] spinocerebellar tracts, rostral spinocere-
bellar ﬁbers) and from the accessory (lateral) cuneate nucleus (cune-
ocerebellar ﬁbers). Also illustrated is the somatotopy of those ﬁbers that 
enter the cerebellum via the restiform body, the larger portion of the 
inferior cerebellar peduncle, or in relationship to the superior cerebellar 
peduncle. After these ﬁbers enter the cerebellum, collaterals are given 
off to the cerebellar nuclei while the parent axons of spinocerebellar 
and cuneocerebellar ﬁbers pass on to the cortex, where they end as 
mossy ﬁbers in the granule cell layer. Although not shown here, there 
are ascending spinal projections to the medial and dorsal accessory 
nuclei of the inferior olivary complex (spino-olivary ﬁbers). The acces-
sory olivary nuclei (as well as the principal olivary nucleus) project to 
the cerebellar cortex and send collaterals into the nuclei (see Figure 
8-35 on p. 244).
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+) is found in some spinocerebellar ﬁbers, in their mossy 
ﬁber terminals in the cerebellar cortex, and in their collateral branches 
that innervate the cerebellar nuclei.
8-34
Clinical Correlations
Lesions, or tumors, that selectively damage only spinocerebellar ﬁbers 
are rarely, if ever, seen in humans. The ataxia one might expect to see in 
patients with a spinal cord hemisection (e.g., the Brown-Séquard syn-
drome) is masked by the hemiplegia of the ipsilateral UE and LE result-
ing from the concomitant damage to lateral corticospinal (and other) 
ﬁbers. There are also genetic defects that affect these tracts.
Friedreich ataxia (hereditary spinal ataxia) is an autosomal recessive 
disorder, the symptoms of which usually appear between 8 and 15 years 
of age. There is degeneration of anterior and posterior spinocerebellar 
tracts plus the posterior columns and corticospinal tracts. Degenera-
tive changes are also seen in cerebellar Purkinje cells, in posterior root 
ganglion cells, in neurons of the Clarke column, and in some nuclei of 
the pons and medulla. These patients have ataxia (early onset), dysar-
thria, muscle weakness/paralysis (particularly in the LEs), and skeletal 
defects. The axial and appendicular ataxia seen in these patients cor-
relates partially with the spinocerebellar degeneration and also partially 
with proprioceptive losses via the degeneration of posterior column  
ﬁbers.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Pontocerebellar, Reticulocerebellar, Olivocerebellar, Ceruleocerebellar, 
Hypothalamocerebellar, and Raphecerebellar Fibers in Anatomical Orientation
Afferent ﬁbers to the cerebellum from selected brainstem 
areas and the organization of corticopontine ﬁbers in the 
internal capsule and crus cerebri as shown here. Pontocerebellar axons 
are mainly crossed, reticulocerebellar ﬁbers may be bilateral (from  
RetTegNu) or mainly uncrossed (from LRNu and PRNu), and olivocer-
ebellar ﬁbers (OCblF) are exclusively crossed. Raphecerebellar, hypoth-
alamocerebellar, and ceruleocerebellar ﬁbers are, to varying degrees, 
bilateral projections. Although all afferent ﬁbers to the cerebellum give 
rise to collaterals to the cerebellar nuclei, those from pontocerebellar 
axons are relatively small, having comparatively small diameters. 
Olivocerebellar axons end as climbing ﬁbers, reticulocerebellar and 
pontocerebellar ﬁbers as mossy ﬁbers, and hypothalamocerebellar and 
ceruleocerebellar axons end in all cortical layers. These latter ﬁbers 
have been called multilayered ﬁbers in the literature because they 
branch in all layers of the cerebellar cortex.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+) is found in corticopontine projections and in most  
pontocerebellar ﬁbers. Aspartate (+) and corticotropin (+)-releasing 
8-35
factor are present in many olivocerebellar ﬁbers. Ceruleocerebellar 
ﬁbers contain noradrenalin, histamine is found in hypothalamocer-
ebellar ﬁbers, and some reticulocerebellar ﬁbers contain enkephalin. 
Serotonergic ﬁbers to the cerebellum arise from neurons found in 
medial areas of the reticular formation (open gray cell in Figure 8-35 
on the facing page) and, most likely, from some cells in the adjacent 
raphe nuclei.
Clinical Correlations
Common symptoms seen in patients with lesions involving nuclei and 
tracts that project to the cerebellum are ataxia (of trunk or limbs), an 
ataxic gait, dysarthria, dysphagia, and disorders of eye movement such 
as nystagmus. These deﬁcits are seen in some hereditary diseases (e.g., 
olivopontocerebellar degeneration, ataxia telangiectasia, or hereditary 
cerebellar ataxia), in tumors (brainstem gliomas), in vascular diseases 
(lateral pontine syndrome), or in other conditions, such as alcoholic 
cerebellar degeneration or pontine hemorrhages (see Figures 8-36 and 
8-38A, B on pp. 246 and 250–251 for more information on cerebellar 
lesions).

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Cerebellar Corticonuclear, Nucleocortical, and Corticovestibular  
Fibers in Anatomical Orientation
Cerebellar corticonuclear ﬁbers arise from all regions of the 
cortex and terminate in an orderly (mediolateral and rostro-
caudal) sequence in the ipsilateral cerebellar nuclei. Corticonuclear ﬁb-
ers from the vermal cortex terminate in the fastigial nucleus, those from 
the intermediate cortex in the emboliform and globose nuclei, and those 
from the lateral cortex in the dentate nucleus. Also, cerebellar cortico-
nuclear ﬁbers from the anterior lobe typically terminate in more ros-
trally in these nuclei whereas those from the posterior lobe terminate 
more caudally. Cerebellar corticovestibular ﬁbers originate primarily 
from the vermis and ﬂocculonodular lobe, exit the cerebellum via the 
juxtarestiform body, and end in the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei. Corti-
conuclear and corticovestibular ﬁbers arise from Purkinje cells.
Nucleocortical processes originate from cerebellar nuclear neurons 
and pass to the overlying cortex in a pattern that reciprocates the corti-
conuclear projection; they end as mossy ﬁbers. Some nucleocortical ﬁb-
ers are collaterals of cerebellar efferent axons. The cerebellar cortex may 
inﬂuence the activity of lower motor neurons through many combinations 
of circuits, for example, the cerebellovestibular–vestibulospinal route.
Neurotransmitters
γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) (–) is found in Purkinje cells and is the 
principal transmitter substance present in cerebellar corticonuclear and 
corticovestibular projections. However, taurine (–) and motilin (–) are 
also found in some Purkinje cells. GABA-ergic terminals are numerous 
in the cerebellar nuclei and vestibular complex. Some of the glutamate-
containing mossy ﬁbers in the cerebellar cortex represent the endings 
of nucleocortical ﬁbers that originate from cells in the cerebellar nuclei.
Clinical Correlations
Numerous disease entities can result in cerebellar dysfunction, includ-
ing viral infections (echovirus), hereditary diseases (see Figure 8-35), 
trauma, tumors (glioma, medulloblastoma), occlusion of cerebellar 
arteries (cerebellar stroke), arteriovenous malformations, develop-
mental errors (e.g., the Dandy-Walker syndrome or the Arnold-Chiari 
deformity), or the intake of alcohol or toxins. Damage to only the cor-
tex results in transient deﬁcits unless the lesion is quite large or causes 
8-36
an increase in intracranial pressure. However, lesions involving both the 
cortex and nuclei, or only the nuclei, may result in long-term deﬁcits.
Lesions involving midline structures (vermal cortex, fastigial nuclei) 
and/or the ﬂocculonodular lobe result in truncal ataxia (titubation or 
tremor), nystagmus, and head tilting. These patients also may have a 
wide-based (cerebellar) gait, are unable to walk in tandem (heel to toe), 
and may be unable to walk on their heels or on their toes. Generally, 
midline lesions result in bilateral motor deﬁcits affecting axial and prox-
imal limb musculature.
Damage to the intermediate and lateral cortices and the globose, 
emboliform, and dentate nuclei results in various combinations of the 
following: dysarthria, dysmetria (hypometria, hypermetria), dysdiado-
chokinesia, tremor (static, kinetic, intention), rebound phenomenon, 
unsteady and wide-based (cerebellar) gait, and nystagmus. A commonly 
observed deﬁcit in patients with cerebellar lesions is an intention tremor, 
which is best seen in the ﬁnger-nose test; as the ﬁnger approaches the 
nose the tremor intensiﬁes. The ﬁnger-to-ﬁnger test is also used to assess 
cerebellar function. The heel-to-shin test (sliding one heel down the 
opposite shin) will show dysmetria in that lower extremity. If the heel-
to-shin test is normal in a patient with his or her eyes open, the cerebel-
lum is intact. If this test is repeated in the same patient with eyes closed 
and is abnormal, this would suggest a lesion in the posterior column–
medial lemniscus system.
Cerebellar damage in intermittent and lateral areas (nuclei or cortex 
plus nuclei) causes movement disorders on the same side of the body 
as the lesion; the patient may tend to fall toward the side of the lesion. 
This is explained by the cerebellar nuclei projecting to contralateral 
VL of thalamus, VL projects to ipsilateral motor cortex, motor cor-
tex projects (corticospinal ﬁbers) to the contralateral spinal cord. Other 
circuits (cerebellorubral–rubrospinal) and feedback loops (cerebello-
olivary–olivocerebellar) follow similar routes. The motor expression of 
unilateral cerebellar damage is toward the lesioned side because of these 
doubly crossed pathways.
Lesions of cerebellar efferent ﬁbers, after they cross the midline in the 
decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, will give rise to motor 
deﬁcits on the contralateral side of the body (excluding the head). This 
is seen in midbrain lesions such as the Claude syndrome.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Cerebellar Efferent Fibers in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, topography, and general distribution of 
ﬁbers arising in the cerebellar nuclei. Cerebellofugal ﬁbers 
(cerebellar efferent ﬁbers commonly called cerebellothalamic ﬁbers) 
project to several thalamic areas (VL and VA), to intralaminar relay 
nuclei in addition to the centromedian, and a number of midbrain, pon-
tine, and medullary targets. Most of the latter nuclei project back to the 
cerebellum (e.g., reticulocerebellar, pontocerebellar), some in a highly 
organized manner. For example, cerebello-olivary ﬁbers from the den-
tate nucleus (DNu) project to the principal olivary nucleus (PO), and 
neurons of the PO send their axons back to the lateral cerebellar cortex, 
with collaterals going to the DNu.
The cerebellar nuclei can inﬂuence motor activity through, as 
examples, the following routes: (1) cerebellorubral-rubrospinal; (2) 
cerebelloreticular-reticulospinal; (3) cerebellothalamic-thalamocortical-
corticospinal; and (4) others. In addition, some direct cerebellospinal 
ﬁbers arise in the fastigial nucleus as well as in the interposed nuclei.
8-37
Neurotransmitters
Many cells in the cerebellar nuclei contain glutamate (+), aspartate (+), 
or γ-aminobutyric acid (–). Glutamate and aspartate are found in cerebel-
lorubral and cerebellothalamic ﬁbers, whereas some GABA-containing 
cells give rise to cerebellopontine and cerebello-olivary ﬁbers. Some cer-
ebelloreticular projections also may contain GABA.
Clinical Correlations
Lesions of the cerebellar nuclei result in a range of motor deﬁcits 
depending on the location of the injury. Many of these are described in 
Figures 8-36 and 8-38B on pp. 246 and 251, respectively.

Representative lesions of the cerebellum and of cerebel-
lothalamic ﬁbers in the midbrain (and the adjacent red 
nucleus) and the deﬁcits (in pink boxes) that correlate with each lesion. 
It is important to remember that the motor deﬁcits seen in patients with 
cerebellar lesions are expressed through the corticospinal tract. Conse-
quently, if a lesion is proximal to the decussation of the superior 
8-38B
cerebellar peduncle, the deﬁcits are ipsilateral to the lesion; if a lesion is 
distal to the decussation, the deﬁcits are on the contralateral side. Note 
that the laterality (R/L) of the deﬁcits is determined by whether the 
lesion is on the left or right side of the MRI; this reinforces important 
clinical concepts. For additional information on deﬁcits related to cere-
bellar lesions, see Figure 8-36 on p. 246.

8-39 Blank Master Drawing for Efferent Cerebellar Connections

The origin, course, and distribution of afferent ﬁbers to, and effer-
ent projections from, the neostriatum. These projections are exten-
sive, complex, and, in large part, topographically organized; only their general 
patterns are summarized here. Afferents to the caudate and putamen originate 
from the cerebral cortex (corticostriate ﬁbers), from the intralaminar thalamic 
nuclei (thalamostriate), from the substantia nigra–pars compacta (nigrostri-
ate), and from the raphe nuclei. Neostriatal cells send axons into the globus 
pallidus (paleostriatum) as striopallidal ﬁbers and into the substantia nigra–
pars reticulata as a strionigral projection.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+) is found in corticostriate ﬁbers, and serotonin is found 
in raphe striatal ﬁbers from the nucleus raphe dorsalis. Four neuroac-
tive substances are associated with striatal efferent ﬁbers, these being 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (–), dynorphin, enkephalin (–), and sub-
stance P (+). Enkephalinergic and GABA-ergic striopallidal projections 
are numerous to the lateral pallidum (origin of pallidosubthalamic ﬁb-
ers), whereas GABA-ergic and dynorphin-containing terminals are more 
concentrated in its medial segment (source of pallidothalamic ﬁbers). 
Enkephalin and GABA are also present in strionigral projections to the 
pars reticulata. Substance P and GABA are found in striopallidal and 
strionigral ﬁbers. Dopamine is present in nigrostriatal projection neu-
rons and in their terminals in the neostriatum.
Clinical Correlations
Degenerative changes, neuron loss, or loss of afferent ﬁbers in the caudate 
nucleus, putamen, or substantia nigra result in movement disorders. Exam-
ples are seen in Sydenham chorea (rheumatic chorea), Huntington disease 
(a dominantly inherited disease), and Wilson disease (a genetic error in 
copper metabolism) and, Parkinson disease a loss of dopaminergic cells in 
the substantia nigra, pars compacta, and their neostriatial terminals.
Sydenham chorea is a disease seen in children between 5 and 15 years  
of age, resulting from infection with hemolytic streptococcus. The 
choreiform movements are brisk and ﬂowing, irregular, and may involve 
muscles of the limbs, face, oral cavity, and trunk. Dystonia may be seen; 
muscle weakness is common. In most patients, the disease resolves after 
treatment of the infection.

Huntington disease is an inherited disorder; the symptoms appear 
at 35 to 45 years of age and are progressive. A feature of this disease 
is excessive CAG repeats on chromosome 4 (4p16.3); the greater the 
number of repeats, the earlier the onset, and more severe the disease. 
There is loss of GABA-ergic and enkephalinergic cells in the neostria-
tum (primarily the caudate) and cell loss in the cerebral cortex. Loss of 
neostriatal cell terminals in the lateral and medial segments of the globus 
pallidus correlates with the development of choreiform movements and 
later with rigidity and dystonia. Loss of cortical neurons correlates with 
personality changes and eventual dementia. Huntington chorea is rapid, 
unpredictable, and may affect muscles of the extremities, face, and trunk. 
Patients commonly attempt to mask the abnormal movement by trying 
to make it appear to be part of an intended movement (parakinesia).
Symptoms in Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) appear 
between 10 and 25 years of age. Copper accumulates in the basal nuclei 
and the frontal cortex, with resultant spongy degeneration in the puta-
men. These patients may show athetoid movements, rigidity and spastic-
ity, dysarthria, dysphagia, contractures, and tremor. A unique movement 
of the hand and/or upper extremity in these patients is called a ﬂapping 
tremor (asterixis) sometimes described as a wing-beating tremor. Copper 
also can be seen in the cornea (Kayser-Fleischer ring) in these patients.
In Parkinson disease (onset at 50 to 60 years of age), there is a pro-
gressive loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra–pars com-
pacta, their terminals in the caudate and putamen, and their dendrites 
that extend into the substantia nigra–pars reticulata. Patients with Par-
kinson disease characteristically show a resting tremor (pill-rolling), 
rigidity (cogwheel or lead-pipe), and bradykinesia or hypokinesia. The 
slowness of movement also may be expressed in speech (dysarthria, 
hypophonia, trachyphonia) and writing (micrographia). These patients 
have a distinct stooped ﬂexed posture and a festinating gait. Parkinson 
and Huntington diseases are neurodegenerative disorders.
Dystonia, as seen in some patients with basal nuclei disease, is charac-
terized by increased/sustained muscle contractions, twisting of the trunk 
or extremities, and abnormal postures. These patients may have unusual 
and repetitive movements of the extremities or neck (cervical dystonia 
or spasmodic torticollis). Dystonia may be an inherited progressive dis-
ease or have other causes. The symptoms may initially appear during 
movements or when talking, but in later stages may be present at rest.

8-40 Striatal Connections in Anatomical Orientation

The origin, course, and distribution of efferent projections of 
the globus pallidus (upper illustration), and connections of 
the substantia nigra (lower drawing) that were not shown in relation to 
the pallidum or in Figure 8-40 on p. 255 (see also Figure 8-42A on  
p. 258). The ansa lenticularis (dashed line) arches around the internal 
capsule and passes caudally to join in the formation of the thalamic 
fasciculus. Pallidosubthalamic ﬁbers originate primarily from the lateral 
pallidal segment, but pallidothalamic projections, via the ansa lenticularis 
and lenticular fasciculus, arise mainly from its medial segment. The 
substantia nigra has extensive connections, the clinically most important 
being the dopaminergic nigrostriatal ﬁbers. The globus pallidus 
inﬂuences motor activity by way of pallidothalamic–thalamocortical–
corticospinal (and corticonuclear) pathways.
Neurotransmitters
γ-Aminobutyric acid (–)–containing cells in the globus pallidus give 
rise to pallidonigral projections, which end primarily in the substantia 
nigra–pars reticulata. Although GABA is also found in some subthalam-
opallidal axons, this latter projection contains many glutaminergic (+) 
ﬁbers.
Dopamine-, GABA (–)-, and glycine (–)-containing cells are present 
in the substantia nigra. Of these, dopamine is found in pars compacta 
neurons, which give rise to nigrostriatal, nigroamygdaloid, and sev-
eral other projections; GABA in pars reticulata cells, which give rise 
256

Pallidal Efferents and Nigral Connections in Anatomical Orientation
8-41
to nigrocollicular and nigrothalamic ﬁbers; and glycine in some local 
circuit nigral neurons. Glutamate (+) is found in corticonigral ﬁbers, 
and serotonin (–) is associated with raphenigral ﬁbers; these latter ﬁbers 
originate primarily from the nucleus raphe dorsalis.
The dopaminergic projections to the frontal cortex, shown here as 
arising only from SNpc, originate from this cell group as well as from 
the immediately adjacent ventral tegmental area. Excessive activity in 
neurons comprising this projection may play a partial role in schizo-
phrenia.
Clinical Correlations
Movement disorders associated with lesions in the neostriatum and 
substantia nigra are reviewed in Figures 8-40 and 8-42B on pp. 254 
and 259. Hemorrhage into, the occlusion of vessels serving, or a tumor 
within, the subthalamic nucleus will result in violent ﬂailing movements 
of the extremities, a condition called hemiballismus. Through subtha-
lamopallidal ﬁbers to the medial segment of the globul pallidus and pal-
lidothalamic ﬁbers to the ipsilateral VL of the thalamus, the subthalamic 
nucleus inﬂuences the motor cortex on the same side, which, in turn, 
inﬂuences spinal motor neurons on the side opposite the primary lesion.
Hemiballistic movements are seen contralateral to the lesion because 
the motor expression of this lesion is through the corticospinal tract. 
Lesions conﬁned to the globus pallidus, as in hemorrhage of lenticulos-
triate arteries, may result in hypokinesia and rigidity without tremor.

The direct and indirect pathways through the basal nuclei, 
subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra superimposed 
on MRI (forebrain, T2-weighted MRI) shown in clinical orientation. 
The exploded view below the MRI illustrates the speciﬁc ﬁber types, by 
name, that comprise these two pathways and speciﬁes whether the syn-
aptic inﬂuences are excitatory (+) or inhibitory (–).
The direct pathway essentially functions as follows. The corticos-
triatal (+) ﬁber excites the striatopallidal (–) ﬁber, which inhibits the 
pallidothalamic (–) ﬁber. In this situation, the thalamus is disinhibited 
(removed from the inhibition of the pallidothalamic ﬁber), and the 
activity of the thalamus and motor cortex is up-regulated.
8-42A
The indirect pathway functions in the following way. The corticos-
triatal (+) ﬁber excites the striatopallidal (−) ﬁber, which inhibits the 
pallidosubthalamic (–) ﬁber. In this situation, the subthalamic nucleus 
is disinhibited (removed from the inhibition of the pallidosubthalamic 
ﬁber), and the subthalamopallidal (+) ﬁber excites the pallidothalamic 
(–) ﬁber, which inhibits the thalamus; the activity of the thalamus and 
the motor cortex is down-regulated.
These two pathways work together. However, their inﬂuence takes 
into account the different number of synapses in each pathway; the 
respective messages are temporally separated.

basal nuclei and related structures are expressed through the corticospi-
nal tract. Note that the laterality (R/L) of the deﬁcits is determined by 
whether the lesion is on the left or right side of the MRI; this reinforces 
important clinical concepts.

Pupillary Pathways
The origin, course, and distribution of ﬁbers involved in the 
pathway for the pupillary light reﬂex. In addition, the path-
way for sympathetic innervation of the dilator muscle of the iris is also 
depicted. The intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord receives 
input predominately from the paraventricular nucleus and also from 
cells in the lateral hypothalamic zone and posterior hypothalamus. This 
projection may be supplemented, in a minor way, by descending ﬁbers 
through the reticular formation of the brainstem. Postganglionic sym-
pathetic ﬁbers to the head originate from the superior cervical ganglion. 
Although not shown, descending projections to the intermediolateral 
cell column also originate from various hypothalamic areas and nuclei 
(hypothalamospinal ﬁbers), some of which receive retinal input.
Neurotransmitters
Acetylcholine is the transmitter found in the preganglionic and post-
ganglionic autonomic ﬁbers shown in this illustration. In addition, 
N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate is present in some retinal ganglion cells 
(retinogeniculate projections).
Clinical Correlations
Total or partial blindness in one or both eyes may result from a vari-
ety of causes (e.g., gliomas, meningiomas, strokes, aneurysms, infec-
tions, and demyelinating diseases); lesions may occur at any locus along 
the visual pathway. A complete lesion (i.e., a transection) of the optic 
nerve will result in blindness and loss of the pupillary light reﬂex (direct 
response) in the eye on the injured side and a loss of the pupillary light 
reﬂex (consensual response) in the opposite eye when shining a light 
in the blind eye. On the other hand, shining a light in the normal eye 
will result in a pupillary light reﬂex (direct response) in that eye and a 
8-44
consensual response in the blind eye. See also Figure 8-32 on p. 239. A 
pituitary adenoma may damage the crossing ﬁbers in the optic chiasm 
(producing a bitemporal hemianopia) or damage the uncrossed ﬁbers in 
the right (or left) side of the optic chiasm. These lateral lesions produce 
a right (or left) nasal hemianopia.
Optic (geniculocalcarine) radiations (see Figs. 8-45 and 8-47 on  
pp. 264 and 266) may pass directly caudal to the upper lip (cuneus) of 
the calcarine sulcus or follow an arching route (the Meyer, or Meyer-
Archambault loop) through the temporal lobe to the lower bank (lin-
gual gyrus) of the calcarine sulcus. Temporal lobe lesions involving the 
Meyer-Archambault loop, or involving ﬁbers entering the lingual gyrus, 
can produce a homonymous superior quadrantanopia. A homonymous 
inferior quadrantanopia is seen in patients with damage to upper (pari-
etal) parts of the geniculocalcarine radiations or to these ﬁbers as they 
enter the cuneus. See Figure 8-47B on p. 267 for additional lesions of 
the visual pathways and the corresponding visual ﬁeld deﬁcits.
Damage to the visual cortex adjacent to the calcarine sulcus (distal 
posterior cerebral artery occlusion) results in a right (or left) homony-
mous hemianopia. With the exception of macular sparing, this deﬁcit is 
the same as that seen in optic tract lesions. See Figure 8-47B on p. 267 
for additional lesions of the optic radiations and visual cortex and the 
corresponding visual ﬁeld deﬁcits.
Vascular lesions (e.g., the lateral medullary syndrome), tumors (e.g., 
brainstem gliomas), or syringobulbia may interrupt the descending pro-
jections from hypothalamus (hypothalamospinal ﬁbers) and midbrain 
to the intermediolateral cell column at upper thoracic levels. This may 
result in a Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) on the ipsi-
lateral side. The enophthalmos (a slight sinking of the eyeball into the 
orbit) frequently mentioned in relation to Horner syndrome is not really 
very apparent in afﬂicted patients.

International clinical convention dictates that Visual Field Deﬁcits 
are illustrated as the patient sees the environment. In this respect, the 
patient’s right eye and visual ﬁeld are on the right and the patient’s left 
eye and visual ﬁeld are on the left. Axial and coronal MRI and CT 
images are viewed as if the observer is standing at the patient’s feet 
looking toward the head (axial) or looking at the patient’s face

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Auditory Pathways in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and distribution of the ﬁbers collec-
tively composing the auditory pathway. Central to the 
cochlear nerve and dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, this system is, 
largely, bilateral and multisynaptic, as input is relayed to the auditory 
cortex. Synapse and crossing (or re-crossing) of information can 
occur at several levels in the neuraxis. Consequently, central lesions 
rarely result in a total unilateral hearing loss. The medial geniculate 
body is the thalamic station for the relay of auditory information to 
the temporal cortex.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+) and aspartate (+) are found in some spiral ganglion cells 
and in their central terminations in the cochlear nuclei. Dynorphin- 
containing and histamine-containing ﬁbers are also present in the coch-
lear nuclei; the latter arises from the hypothalamus. A noradrenergic 
projection to the cochlear nuclei and the inferior colliculus originates 
from the nucleus locus ceruleus. Cells in the superior olive that contain 
cholecystokinin and cells in the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus that con-
tain dynorphin project to the inferior colliculus. Although the olivoco-
chlear bundle is not shown, it is noteworthy that enkephalin is found in 
some of the cells that contribute to this projection.
Clinical Correlations—Categories of Deafness
Conductive deafness is caused by problems of the external ear (obstruc-
tion of the canal, wax build-up) or disorders of the middle ear (otitis 
media, otosclerosis). Nerve deafness (sensorineural hearing loss) results 
from diseases involving the cochlea or the cochlear portion of the vesti-
bulocochlear nerve. Central deafness results from damage to the coch-
lear nuclei or their central connections.
Hearing loss may result from trauma (e.g., fracture of the petrous 
bone), demyelinating diseases, tumors, certain medications (streptomy-
cin), or occlusion of the labyrinthine artery. Damage to the cochlear 
part of the eighth nerve (e.g., vestibular schwannoma) results in tinnitus 
and/or deafness (partial or total) in the ipsilateral ear. High-frequency 
8-49
hearing losses (presbyacusis), such as a woman’s voice or discrimination 
between sounds, are more commonly seen in older patients.
The Weber test and Rinne test are used to differentiate between neural 
hearing loss and conduction hearing loss, and to lateralize the deﬁcit. In 
the Weber test, a tuning fork (512 Hz) is applied to the midline of the 
forehead or apex of the skull. In the normal patient, the sound (conducted 
through the skull bones) is heard the same in each ear. In the case of nerve 
deafness (cochlea or cochlear nerve lesions), the sound is best heard in 
the normal ear, whereas in conductive deafness, the sound is best heard 
in the abnormal ear. In the Rinne test, a tuning fork (512 Hz) is placed 
against the mastoid process. When the sound is no longer perceived, the 
prongs are moved close to the external acoustic meatus, where the sound 
is again heard; this is the situation in a normal individual (positive Rinne 
test). In middle ear disease, the sound is not heard at the external meatus 
after it has disappeared from touching the mastoid bone (abnormal or 
negative Rinne test). Therefore, a negative Rinne test signiﬁes conductive 
hearing loss in the ear tested. In mild nerve deafness (cochlea or cochlear 
nerve lesions), the sound is heard by application of the tuning fork to the 
mastoid and movement to the ear (the Rinne test is positive). In severe 
nerve deafness, the sound may not be heard at either position.
In addition to hearing loss and tinnitus, large vestibular schwan-
nomas may result in nausea, vomiting, ataxia/unsteady gait (vestibular 
root involvement), facial muscle weakness (facial root), altered facial 
sensations, and a diminished corneal reﬂex (trigeminal root). There also 
may be general signs associated with increased intracranial pressure 
(lethargy, headache, and vomiting).
Central lesions (e.g., gliomas or vascular occlusions) rarely produce 
unilateral or bilateral hearing losses that can be detected, the possible 
exception being pontine lesions, which damage the trapezoid body 
and nuclei. Injury to central auditory pathways and/or primary audi-
tory cortex may diminish auditory acuity, decrease the ability to hear 
certain tones, or make it difﬁcult to precisely localize sounds in space. 
Patients with damage to the secondary auditory cortex in the temporal 
lobe experience difﬁculty in understanding and/or interpreting sounds 
(auditory agnosia).

8-49 Auditory Pathways in Anatomical Orientation

272
8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Vestibular Pathways in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and distribution of the main afferent and 
efferent connections of the vestibular nuclei (see also Figs. 
8-16, 8-36, and 8-37 on pp. 220, 246 and 248). Primary vestibular 
afferent ﬁbers may end in the vestibular nuclei or pass to cerebellar 
structures via the juxtarestiform body. Secondary vestibulocerebellar 
axons originate from the vestibular nuclei and follow a similar path to 
the cerebellum. Efferent projections from the vestibular nuclei also 
course to the spinal cord through vestibulospinal tracts (see Figs. 8-16, 
8-36, and 8-37), as well as to the motor nuclei of the oculomotor, tro-
chlear, and abducens nerves via the MLF. Cerebellar structures most 
extensively interconnected with the vestibular nuclei include the lateral 
regions of the vermal cortex of anterior and posterior lobes, the ﬂoccu-
lonodular lobe, and the fastigial (medial) cerebellar nucleus.
Neurotransmitters
γ-Aminobutyric acid (–) is the transmitter associated with many cerebel-
lar corticovestibular ﬁbers and their terminals in the vestibular com-
plex; this substance is also seen in cerebellar corticonuclear axons. The 
medial vestibular nucleus also has ﬁbers that are dynorphin-positive 
and histamine-positive; the latter arise from cells in the hypothalamus.
Clinical Correlations
The vestibular part of the eighth nerve can be damaged by many of the 
same insults that affect the cochlear nerve. Damage to vestibular recep-
tors of the vestibular nerve commonly results in vertigo. The patient 
may feel that his or her body is moving (subjective vertigo) or that 
8-50
objects in the environment are moving (objective vertigo). They have 
equilibrium problems, an unsteady (ataxic) gait, and a tendency to fall 
to the lesioned side but do not have cerebellar signs such as an intention 
tremor. Deﬁcits seen in nerve lesions, or in brainstem lesions involving 
the vestibular nuclei, include nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting, along 
with vertigo and gait problems.
Vestibular schwannoma represents about 8%–10% of CNS tumors, 
commonly results in hearing loss (95+%), is frequently characterized 
by disequilibrium and tinnitus (65%–70%), and is sometimes related 
to headache and facial numbness (about 30%); the latter indicates 
that the lesion is large (generally > 2 cm in size), and has encroached 
on the trigeminal nerve root. Facial weakness (facial palsy) occurs in 
about 10% of cases. These vestibular deﬁcits, along with partial or 
complete deafness, are seen in Ménière disease. A patient that presents 
with bilateral vestibular schwannomas should be evaluated for neu-
roﬁbromatosis type 2. These lesions are genetic in origin (autosomal 
dominant), may be accompanied by lesions elsewhere in the body (but 
less than NFT-Type 1), and are sometimes called bilateral acoustic neu-
roﬁbromatosis.
Lesions of those parts of the cerebellum with which the vestibular 
nerve and nuclei are most intimately connected (ﬂocculonodular lobe 
and fastigial nucleus) result in nystagmus, truncal ataxia, ataxic gait, 
and a propensity to fall to the injured side. The nystagmus seen in 
patients with vestibular lesions and the internuclear ophthalmoplegia 
seen in some patients with multiple sclerosis are signs that correlate 
with the interruption of vestibular projections to the motor nuclei of III, 
IV, and VI via the MLF.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Internal Capsule and Thalamocortical Connections
The Internal Capsule: Relationships and Contents
The internal capsule, its relationship to the basal nuclei and tha-
lamus, and its major constituent ﬁber bundles in the axial plane. 
Pathways conveying sensory information (with the exception of olfaction) 
from the entire body and pathways inﬂuencing motor activity of cranial 
nerves and the extremities all traverse some part of the internal capsule.
The internal capsule is divided into ﬁve parts, called limbs, which 
are most easily recognized in the axial plane (see facing page). Each 
limb has a characteristic relationship to adjacent structures and largely 
contains particular ﬁber groups.
Anterior limb: The anterior limb is located between the head of the 
caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus. The major ﬁber populations 
found in the anterior limb are frontopontine ﬁbers, the anterior tha-
lamic radiations (medial and anterior thalamic projections to the fron-
tal and cingulate cortex), and, adjacent to the genu, small fascicles of 
descending ﬁbers from the frontal eye ﬁelds.
Genu: The positions of the column of the fornix, the interventricular 
foramen, the venous angle, and the anterior tubercle of the thalamus 
indicate the location of the genu of the internal capsule. The most clini-
cally signiﬁcant ﬁber bundles in the genu are corticonuclear ﬁbers pro-
jecting to the motor nuclei of cranial nerves (see also Figures 8-13 and 
8-14 on pp. 214–217).
Posterior limb: The posterior limb is the largest part of the internal 
capsule, is located between the thalamus and the lenticular nucleus, and 
contains a number of important ﬁber populations. These larger bundles 
include corticospinal ﬁbers, superior thalamic radiations (ventral ante-
rior, ventral lateral, ventral posteromedial, and posterolateral projec-
tions to motor and sensory cortices), and, in its more caudal region, 
parietopontine ﬁbers. Smaller bundles of ﬁbers including corticorubral, 
corticoreticular, corticonigral, corticosubthalamic, the general category 
of corticotegmental ﬁbers, and pallidothalamic ﬁbers that arise in the 
medial segment of the globus pallidus, traverse the posterior limb.
Sublenticular limb: The sublenticular limb is difﬁcult to identify, 
although its trajectory and contents are well known. It extends between 
the medial geniculate nucleus and the temporal lobe, particularly the 
auditory cortex, and contains auditory radiations (genticulotemporal 
radiations), temporopontine ﬁbers, and corticotectal ﬁbers.
Retrolenticular limb: The retrolenticular limb is that large mass of 
ﬁbers located immediately caudal the lenticular nucleus; hence its name, 
retrolenticular. The larger ﬁber bundles within this limb are visual radi-
ations (geniculocalcarine or optic radiations) and occipitopontine ﬁb-
ers; the smaller bundles comprise corticotectal, corticotegmental, and 
some corticorubral ﬁbers.
Recall that the optic radiations are composed of ﬁbers that arise in 
the lateral geniculate nucleus and pass caudally directly to the primary 
visual cortex, and of ﬁbers that arise in the lateral geniculate nucleus, 
arch forward into the temporal lobe, turn sharply caudal (as the Meyer 
loop), and then proceed to the primary visual cortex. These two por-
tions of the optic radiations are conveying information from different 
parts of the visual ﬁelds; lesions of these parts result in speciﬁc visual 
deﬁcits (see Figs. 8-44 through 8-47 on pp. 262–267).
8-52
General note: Most of the limbs of the internal capsule also contain 
thalamocortical projections (other than those mentioned above), cor-
ticothalamic ﬁbers (from all cortical areas to their respective thalamic 
nuclei), and corticostriate ﬁbers.
Neurotransmitters
There are no nuclei within the internal capsule, only ﬁbers of passage 
conveying a variety of motor and sensory information, and ﬁbers that 
are integrative in nature. The major transmitters associated with ﬁbers 
within the internal capsule are glutamate (most cortical efferent ﬁbers, 
thalamocortical ﬁbers) and GABA (pallidothalamic ﬁbers), and smaller 
populations of cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, histaminer-
gic, and GABA-ergic ﬁbers.
Clinical Correlations
Lesions of the internal capsule are usually expressed as movement dis-
orders related to involvement of corticospinal or corticonuclear ﬁbers 
(depending on the general location of the lesion) and somatosensory 
losses related to damage to thalamocortical projections. A general char-
acteristic of forebrain lesions is motor and sensory deﬁcits that are all on 
the same side (the side of the body opposite the location of the lesion). 
Cranial nerve deﬁcits are usually lacking unless the damage involves the 
genu of the internal capsule.
A lesion in the genu of the internal capsule results in deﬁcits that gen-
erally reﬂect damage to corticonuclear ﬁbers to the facial and hypoglos-
sal nuclei, and to the nucleus ambiguus. The facial muscles are weak on 
the lower half of the face opposite the lesion (a central seven as opposed 
to a Bell palsy), the tongue deviates to the opposite side on attempted 
protrusion, and the uvula deviates toward the lesioned side when the 
patient makes an “ah” sound. In addition, the patient may not be able 
to elevate the ipsilateral shoulder against resistance (trapezius weak-
ness) or to rotate the head to the contralateral side against resistance 
(sternocleidomastoid weakness) assuming injury to ﬁbers of the acces-
sory nucleus. This combination of deﬁcits is unique to genu lesions and 
is clearly different from cranial nerve deﬁcits resulting from brainstem 
lesions.
Damage to the posterior limb of the internal capsule may result in a 
frank contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis (-plegia refers to paralysis 
and -paresis refers to weakness or incomplete paralysis) affecting upper 
and lower extremities and a hemianesthesia on the same side as the 
weakness. This sensory loss may affect the body only or the body plus 
the head.
The anterior choroidal artery syndrome (also called von Monakow 
syndrome) is characterized by a hemiplegia and a homonymous hemi-
anopia, both contralateral to the side of the lesion. If this lesion (which 
is in the lower portion of the posterior limb) extends upward, it may 
also involve thalamocortical ﬁbers from sensory relay nuclei, producing 
a hemianesthesia on the same side as the other deﬁcits. This vessel serves 
portions of the genu, and corticonuclear deﬁcits may sometimes be seen.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
The Topography of Thalamocortical Connections
The major nuclei of the dorsal thalamus, commonly called the 
thalamus, and their major cortical targets. The thalamic nuclei 
may generally be divided into association nuclei, relay nuclei, and intral-
aminar nuclei. Association nuclei project to multiple cortical regions 
and receive input from similarly diverse regions (e.g., pulvinar, centro-
median). Relay nuclei are those which receive a speciﬁc type of informa-
tion (discriminative touch, vision) and send this information on to a 
precise cortical target (primary somatosensory cortex, primary visual 
cortex); examples are: the ventral posterolateral nucleus and the lateral 
geniculate nucleus. Intralaminar nuclei are located within the internal 
medullary lamina; the most obvious is the centromedian nucleus; smaller 
intralaminar nuclei include the central lateral, central medial, and the 
parafascicular nuclei. The thalamic reticular nucleus is a group of neu-
rons forming a shell around the thalamus, separated from it by the inter-
nal medullary lamina, and located medial to the internal capsule.
The thalamic nuclei receive information from many sources and 
project to the cerebral cortex. The more important thalamic nuclei, their 
afferents, and the cortical areas/gyri to which they project are summa-
rized below and illustrated in Figure 8-53 on the facing page. Some 
generalizations are made for clarity.

orbitofrontal cortex, olfactory system, basal forebrain; efferents—orbital 
cortex, medial and lateral frontal lobe (excluding the motor cortex)
Pulvinar: afferents—superior colliculus, visual cortex (areas 17, 18, 19), 
temporal and occipital cortex; efferents—superior colliculus, visual cor-
tex (areas 17, 18, 19), temporal and occipital cortex

Clinical Correlations
The thalamus receives extensive sensory and motor messages, has an 
equally extensive projection to all parts of the cerebral cortex, and 
receives reciprocal connections from the cerebral cortex. Consequently, 
a variety of deﬁcits is seen resultant to lesions of the thalamus. While tha-
lamic lesions may present as tumors (such as astrocytoma), neural degen-
erative, or encephalopathic, they are most commonly vascular in origin.
Hemorrhage into the thalamogeniculate territory damages the sensory 
relay nuclei (VPM and VPL) and may result in the thalamic syndrome 
(syndrome of Déjèrine-Roussy). The characteristics of this syndrome are: 
(1) loss of all somatic sensation on the contralateral side of the body, 
or a dissociated sensory loss (position/vibratory loss greater than pain/ 
thermal loss, or vice versa); (2) with recovery, the occurrence of a percep-
tion of pain (paresthesia, hyperpathia) sometimes intense and/or long-
lasting; and, (3) may present with a homonymous hemianopia and/or 
hemiplegia of the UE and LE, all on the contralateral side; these may 
resolve with time. The hemiplegia may relate to hemorrhage impinging on 
the laterally adjacent internal capsule or pressure from the primary lesion.
In addition to variations of the thalamic syndrome, hemorrhagic tha-
lamic lesions may extend into the midbrain and produce various ocu-
lomotor deﬁcits (third nerve or nucleus damage), pupil dilation, and an 
absent or diminished pupillary light reﬂex. These hemorrhagic lesions 
may also invade the subthalamic nucleus and contribute abnormal 
movements to the overall clinical picture.
Lesions in more anterior and medial portions of the dorsal thalamus 
may produce deﬁcits that are generally more global. The patient may 
experience ataxia (thalamic ataxia) of a transient nature and possibly 
aphasia .In the case of a lesion in the thalamic territory of an azygous 
thalamoperforating territory (see Figure 2-44, p. 39), the pathway of 
the ascending reticular activating system is interrupted, and the patient 
may be difﬁcult to arouse, stuporous, or in a coma.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Limbic System: Hippocampus and Amygdala
Hippocampal Connections in Anatomical Orientation
Selected afferent and efferent connections of the hippoc-
ampus (upper) and the mammillary body (lower) with 
emphasis on the circuit of Papez. The hippocampus receives input 
from, and projects to, diencephalic nuclei (especially the mammil-
lary body via the postcommissural fornix), the septal region, and 
amygdala. The hippocampus receives cortical input from the supe-
rior and middle frontal gyri, superior temporal and cingulate gyri, 
precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, occipitotemporal gyri, and sub-
callosal cortical areas. The mammillary body is connected with the 
dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei, anterior thalamic nucleus (via 
the mammillothalamic tract), septal nuclei, and through the mam-
millotegmental tract, to the tegmental pontine and reticulotegmental 
nuclei.
Neurotransmitters
Glutamate (+)-containing cells in the subiculum and Ammon’s horn 
project to the mammillary body, other hypothalamic centers, and the 
lateral septal nucleus through the fornix. Cholecystokinin (+) and 
somatostatin (–) are also found in hippocampal cells that project to 
septal nuclei and hypothalamic structures. The septal nuclei and the 
nucleus of the diagonal band give rise to cholinergic afferents to the 
hippocampus that travel in the fornix. In addition, a γ-aminobutyric 
acid (–) septohippocampal projection originates from the medial sep-
tal nucleus. Enkephalin and glutamate containing hippocampal affer-
ent ﬁbers arise from the adjacent entorhinal cortex; the locus ceruleus 
gives origin to noradrenergic ﬁbers to the dentate gyrus, Ammon horn, 
and subiculum; and serotoninergic ﬁbers arise from the rostral raphe 
nuclei.
8-54
Clinical Correlations
Dysfunction associated with damage to the hippocampus is seen in patients 
with trauma to the temporal lobe, as a sequel to alcoholism, and as a result 
of neurodegenerative changes seen in the dementing diseases (e.g., Alzhe-
imer disease and Pick disease). Bilateral injury to the hippocampus results 
in loss of recent memory (remote memory is unaffected), impaired ability 
to remember recent (new) events, and difﬁculty in turning a new experi-
ence (something just done or experienced) into a longer-term memory that 
can be retrieved at a later time. Also, memory that depends on visual, 
tactile, or auditory discrimination is noticeably affected. These represent 
visual agnosia, tactile agnosia, and auditory agnosia, respectively.
In the Korsakoff psychosis (amnestic confabulatory syndrome, 
Korsakoff syndrome) there is memory loss, dementia, amnesia, and a 
tendency to give confabulated responses. This type of response is ﬂu-
ent (the patient’s response is immediate, smooth, and in appropriate 
cadence), but consists of a string of unrelated, or even made up, “mem-
ories” that never actually occurred or make no sense (hence, the con-
fabulation). This may lead to an incorrect conclusion that the patient 
is suffering from dementia. In addition to lesions in the hippocampus 
in these patients, the mammillary bodies and dorsomedial nucleus of 
the thalamus are noticeably affected. Korsakoff psychosis is irreversible.
Wernicke encephalopathy (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, or Wer-
nicke syndrome) is seen in patients who are long-term alcoholics, and 
presents with a variety of eye movement deﬁcits, pupil changes, ataxia, 
confusion, and tremor. Degenerative changes, or cell loss, are seen in 
many areas but especially in the hippocampus, mammillary nuclei, and 
dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus. This condition is treatable with 
therapeutic doses of thiamin and dietary improvements.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation
Amygdaloid Connections in Anatomical Orientation
The origin, course, and distribution of selected afferent and 
efferent connections of the amygdaloid nuclear complex in 
sagittal (upper) and coronal (lower) planes. The amygdala receives 
input from, and projects to, brainstem and forebrain centers via the 
stria terminalis and the ventral amygdalofugal pathway. Corticoamy-
gdaloid and amygdalocortical ﬁbers interconnect the basal and lateral 
amygdaloid nuclei with select cortical areas.
Neurotransmitters
Cells in the amygdaloid complex contain vasoactive intestinal polypep-
tide (VIP, +), neurotensin (NT), somatostatin (SOM, –), enkephalin 
(ENK, –), and substance P (SP, +). These neurons project, via the stria 
terminalis or the ventral amygdalofugal path, to the septal nuclei (VIP, 
NT), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (NT, ENK, SP), the hypoth-
alamus (VIP, SOM, SP), the nucleus accumbens septi, and the caudate 
and putamen (NT). Serotonergic amygdaloid ﬁbers originate from the 
nucleus raphe dorsalis and the superior central nucleus, dopaminergic 
axons from the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra–pars 
compacta, and noradrenalin-containing ﬁbers from the locus ceru-
leus. Glutamate (+) is found in olfactory projections to the prepiriform 
cortex and the amygdaloid complex. Acetylcholine is present in affer-
8-55
ents to the amygdala from the substantia innominata, as well as from 
the septal area. In patients with Alzheimer disease and the associated 
dementia, there is a marked loss of acetylcholine-containing neurons 
in the basal nucleus of the substantia innominata, the cortex, and the 
hippocampus.
Clinical Correlations
Dysfunctions related to damage to the amygdaloid complex are seen in 
patients with trauma to the temporal lobes, herpes simplex encephali-
tis, bilateral temporal lobe surgery to treat intractable epileptic activ-
ity, and in some CNS degenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer disease 
and Pick disease). The behavioral changes seen in individuals with what 
are usually bilateral amygdala lesions collectively form the Klüver-Bucy 
syndrome. In humans these changes/deﬁcits are: 1) hyperorality; 2) vis-
ual, tactile, and auditory agnosia; 3) placidity; 4) hyperphagia or other 
dietary manifestations; 5) an intense desire to explore the immediate 
environment (hypermetamorphosis); and 6) what is commonly called 
hypersexuality. These changes in sexual attitudes are usually in the form 
of comments, suggestions, and and inept attempts at actual contact 
rather than attempts at inappropriate behavior. These patients also may 
show aphasia, dementia, and amnesia.

8: Tracts, Pathways, and Systems in Anatomical and Clinical Orientation—Hypothalamus and Pituitary
Hypothalamic Structures and Connections: Stained Sections
The structure of the hypothalamus in three representative 
coronal sections showing the general arrangement of the 
nuclei at these levels and the relationships of immediately adjacent ﬁber 
bundles and nuclei. The various hypothalamic nuclei that are labeled 
are generally representative of that level; for a more detailed representa-
tion in the axial plane, see Figure 8-59 on p. 290.
The hypothalamus is organized into three rostrocaudally oriented 
zones. The comparatively narrow periventricular zone is located in the 
ventricular wall, is of an irregular thickness, and contains a number of 
small nuclei. Neurons within the periventricular zone function in the 
synthesis of releasing hormones that are conveyed to the pituitary via 
the tuberoinfundibular tract. The medial zone is located immediately 
lateral to the periventricular zone and is divided into three regions: a 
supraoptic region (located internal to the optic chiasm), a tuberal region 
(located internal to the location of the tuber cinereum), and a mammil-
lary region (located internal to the mammillary body). For the large 
part, the medial zone is arranged into a number of named nuclei. The 
lateral zone is an area of diffusely arranged neurons commonly called 
the lateral hypothalamic area that contains relatively few named nuclei, 
but does contain the medial forebrain bundle. The positions of the col-
umn of the fornix and the mammillothalamic tract indicate the border 
between the medial and lateral zones. See Figure 8-59 on p. 290 for 
additional information on hypothalamic zones and nuclei.
Neurotransmitters
The entire diencephalon constitutes only about 2% of the entire CNS 
by weight and the hypothalamus, a small part of the diencephalon, rep-
resents well under 0.2% of the CNS. In spite of its minuscule size, the 
hypothalamus has a widespread and powerful inﬂuence over the CNS, 
and, indeed, the entire body. This is at least partially reﬂected by the 
fact that numerous neurotransmitter substances are found in the cells 
of the hypothalamus or in terminals ending in these nuclei that arise 
in other locations. The following is not intended to be an all-inclusive 
list of transmitters associated with the hypothalamus, but serves as a 
representative example.
Monoamines: The monoamines histamine (cells in the dorsomedial 
nucleus, posterior hypothalamic area, tuberal nuclei), dopamine (cells 
in the caudal hypothalamus A11 cell group, periventricular area), and 
serotonin (ﬁbers in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, preoptic, suprachi-
asmatic, and infundibular nuclei) are found in the hypothalamus. Some 
of these cells may project to other of the hypothalamic nuclei.
Peptides: These are sometimes referred to as gut-brain peptides 
because they were initially isolated from brain and gut tissue. The 
principal peptides found in the hypothalamus are neurotensin (cells in 
rostral periventricular zone, the preoptic, paraventricular, and infundib-
ular nuclei and lateral hypothalamic area; ﬁbers in these nuclei and the 
median eminence), cholecystokinin (cells in the paraventricular, medial 
preoptic, supraoptic, and dorsomedial nuclei; ﬁbers in the ventromedial 
nucleus), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (cells in the suprachiasmatic 
nucleus; ﬁbers in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, paraventricular, ante-
rior nucleus, and preoptic regions); and substance P (cells and ﬁbers 
in the supraoptic, paraventricular, dorsomedial, ventromedial, arcuate, 
preoptic nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area). Angiotensin II is in 
8-58
a family of peptides that exhibits vasoconstrictive activity; these cells 
are found in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (and project to 
the posterior pituitary), and ﬁbers are found in the dorsomedial nucleus.
Releasing factors (RFs) and releasing hormones (RHs): Many of 
these substances are associated with projection systems that originate 
in the hypothalamus and travel to the pituitary. The main releasing fac-
tors and releasing hormones are corticotrophin RF (cells in the medial 
preoptic and paraventricular nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area); 
luteinizing RH (cells in supraoptic, medial preoptic, and infundibular 
nuclei [the latter projects to the posterior pituitary lobe]); somatostatin 
(cells in infundibular, suprachiasmatic, medial preoptic, and paraven-
tricular nuclei [these cells project to other hypothalamic nuclei]), and 
thyrotropin RH (cells in the median eminence; ventromedial, dorso-
medial, preoptic, and suprachiasmatic nuclei; and the periventricular 
zone).
Dynorphin and enkephalin: These substances are found at many 
locations in the CNS; one of their functions is related to pain modu-
lation. Dynorphin (cells in the supraoptic, suprachiasmatic, ventrome-
dial, dorsomedial, and paraventricular nuclei [all of these nuclei plus 
the anterior nucleus and medial preoptic area also contain ﬁbers]) and 
enkephalin (cells in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and the 
preoptic region) are also found in cells located in many areas of the 
forebrain, brainstem, and spinal cord.
Clinical Correlations
Due to its compact nature and location, deﬁcits related to lesions 
involving the hypothalamus are frequently complicated by endocrine 
disorders, visual ﬁeld defects, and behavioral disorders. Only represent-
ative deﬁcits are mentioned here that would relate to lesions within the 
hypothalamus.
The medial mammillary nucleus receives extensive connections from 
the hippocampus via the postcommissural part of the fornix. Lesions of 
the mammillary nuclei result in an inability to process short-term events 
into long-term memory. This may be seen in vascular lesions or in the 
Korsakoff syndrome (Korsakoff psychosis).
The suprachiasmatic nucleus receives input from the retina and is 
involved in the establishment and maintenance of circadian rhythms; 
these are cycles consisting of a light phase and a dark phase collectively 
forming about 24 hours. Damage to this area may modify, or abolish, 
these rhythms.
The supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei synthesize oxytocin and 
vasopressin and transmit these substances to the posterior lobe of the 
pituitary via the supraopticohypophyseal tract. Damage to these nuclei, 
or to this tract, as in a traumatic brain injury, may result in diabetes 
insipidus; this condition is characterized by increased water intake 
(polydipsia) and increased urination (polyuria).
Damage to the nuclei of the lateral hypothalamic area results in 
a decrease in feeding behavior with a resultant weight loss, whereas 
injury to the ventromedial nucleus (commonly called a satiety center) 
will cause excessive eating and abnormal weight gain. The dorsomedial 
nucleus, which is dorsally adjacent to the ventromedial nucleus, is a 
behavioral center; stimulation causes sham rage; destruction results in a 
decrease in aggression and feeding.

Hypothalamic Structures and Connections: Projections
The structure of the hypothalamus represented in the axial 
plane showing the three zones, the regions of each zone, and 
their major afferent and efferent connections. The connections of the 
hypothalamus are complex and widespread within the brain. In addi-
tion, many of these connections are reciprocal: structures that project to 
the hypothalamus frequently receive input from the hypothalamus. An 
effort is made here to illustrate the hypothalamus in axial plane, its 
principal nuclei, and its major afferent and efferent pathways, all in a 
diagrammatic format. Hypothalamic afferents are shown in red (on 
right), efferents in blue (on left).
Zones: The lateral zone (shaded blue) contains diffuse cell groups, 
the tuberal nuclei, and the ﬁbers of the medial forebrain bundle. The 
medial zone is organized into the supraoptic region (shaded green), the 
tuberal region (shaded red), and the mammillary region (shaded gray); 
each region is composed of several named nuclei. The periventricular 
zone (unshaded/white) is a thin sheet of cells in the wall of the hypotha-
lamic portion of the third ventricle. See also Figure 8-58.
Retinohypothalamic ﬁbers: Axons arising from ganglion cells of the 
retina project bilaterally to the suprachiasmatic nucleus via the optic 
nerve and tract. These projections are essential to the maintenance of 
circadian rhythms.
Amygdalohypothalamic ﬁbers: The amydgala projects to the 
hypothalamus via the ventral amygdalofugal pathway (VAF) and the 
stria terminalis (ST). VAF ﬁbers arise in the basolateral amygdala, 
course medially and inferior to the lenticular nucleus, to end in the sep-
tal area, lateral zone, and preoptic areas. Fibers forming the ST arise in 
the corticomedial amygdala, form a small bundle medial to the caudate 
and accompanied by the thalamostriate vein, and distribute to the sep-
tal area and nuclei of the supraoptic and tuberal regions.
Hippocampohypothalamic ﬁbers: Cells of the hippocampal forma-
tion coalesce to form the fornix. The precommissural fornix is diffusely 
arranged and distributes to septal, preoptic, and anterior hypothalamic 
nuclei, whereas the primary target of the postcommissural fornix, which 
is compactly arranged is the medial mammillary nucleus with lesser pro-
jections to the dorsomedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamic zone.
Brainstem-hypothalamic ﬁbers: Afferents to the hypothalamus that 
arise within the brainstem and ascend mainly in the mammillary pedun-
cle and posterior (dorsal) longitudinal fasciculus, with fewer ﬁbers tra-
versing the medial forebrain bundle. These projections arise in the 
tegmental and raphe nuclei of the midbrain, the locus coeruleus, and 
the lateral parabrachial nucleus and terminate in the lateral zone and in 
many of the nuclei of the medial and paraventricular zones. Serotinergic 
ﬁbers arise from the raphe nuclei, and monoaminergic projections origi-
nate from the locus coeruleus.
8-59
Other afferent ﬁbers: The hypothalamus also receives spinohy-
pothalamic ﬁbers via the anterolateral system and corticohypotha-
lamic ﬁbers from widespread areas of the cerebral cortex including 
occipital, frontal, and parietal, and from the cortices of the limbic 
lobe.
Efferent hypothalamic connections: The double-headed arrows on 
the left signify the fact that the amygdaloid nuclear complex and the 
hippocampal formation receive input from the hypothalamic nuclei to 
which they project. This also applies to the fact that many of the corti-
cal areas that give rise to a corticohypothalamic projection also receive 
hypothalamocortical ﬁbers.
The posterior (dorsal) longitudinal fasciculus contains ﬁbers arising 
in various nuclei of the periventricular and medial zones and projects to 
the midbrain tegmentum, tectum, and the central gray of the brainstem; 
some of these ﬁbers target visceral motor nuclei.
The principal mammillary fasciculus is the bundle that passes out of 
the mammillary nuclei, then immediately divides into the mammillotha-
lamic tract and the mammillotegmental tract. The former projects to 
the anterior thalamic nucleus, and the latter projects mainly to the mid-
brain tegmental nuclei.
Descending ﬁbers that arise in the paraventricular and posterior 
hypothalamic nuclei (emphasis on the paraventricular) and in the lat-
eral hypothalamic zone, inﬂuence brainstem visceral motor and sensory 
nuclei, parts of the nucleus ambiguus, the ventrolateral medullary 
regions, and the spinal cord (speciﬁcally the interomediolateral cell col-
umn). Through these descending ﬁbers to visceral nuclei of the brain-
stem, the hypothalamus inﬂuences a wide range of essential activities 
controlled by these brainstem regions. Damage to these hypothalamos-
pinal ﬁbers results in a Horner syndrome (ptosis, myosis, anhydrosis on 
the ipsilateral side) along with other deﬁcits characteristic of the lesion 
be it in the midbrain, lateral pontine tegmentum, lateral medulla, or 
cervical spinal cord.
The medial forebrain bundle is diffusely arranged and contains ﬁb-
ers arising in the lateral zone and ascending to hypothalamic, olfactory, 
and other basal forebrain areas and of some descending ﬁbers to the 
brainstem.
Clinical Correlations
In addition to the clinical comments made above, a number of further 
clinical examples of hypothalamic lesions are described in Figure 8-58 
on p. 288. It is important to recall that hypothalamic lesions may ini-
tially present with the patient complaining of various visual deﬁcits; 
a thorough examination and evaluation will reveal the hypothalamic 
source of the primary lesion.

The Pituitary Gland
The structure, relationships, and major pathways of the pitui-
tary gland in the sagittal plane. The pituitary gland, also 
called the hypophysis, consists of two parts: one that arises from the 
developing oral cavity (adenohypophysis, anterior lobe) and the other 
that arises from the developing neural tube (neurohypophysis, posterior 
lobe).
The adenohypophysis, commonly called the anterior lobe of the pitui-
tary, consists of a larger portion called the pars distalis (or pars anterior), 
a small portion, the pars intermedia, and the pars tuberalis, which is a 
small extension of the anterior lobe that wraps around the infundibular 
stalk. The neurohypophysis, also called the posterior lobe of the pituitary, 
consists of a neural lobe, the pars nervosa, and the infundibulum, or 
infundibular stalk, which joins the neural lobe with the hypothalamus.
The pituitary gland sits in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone; the 
diaphragma sellae, a small extension of the dura, forms a donut-shaped 
structure through which the infundibular stalk passes. The anterior and 
posterior intercavernous sinuses pass across the midline (and between 
the cavernous sinuses) at the attachment of the diaphragma sellae to the 
sphenoid bone.
Hormones
There are numerous hormones and neuroactive substances associated 
with the hypothalamus and pituitary. Of particular importance to the 
pituitary gland are those substances found in the supraopticohypophy-
seal and the tuberoinfundibular (or tuberohypophyseal) tracts.
The peptides oxytocin and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) are 
synthesized in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and trans-
ported to the posterior lobe via the supraopticohypophyseal tract. Oxy-
tocin is released during coitus, parturition, suckling, and regression of 
the uterus after birth. Vasopressin (ADH) is involved in the regulation 
of ﬂuid homeostasis within the body and may either increase or reduce 
the production of urine.
A variety of releasing hormones are synthesized in the periventricu-
lar zone and in the arcuate nucleus, with further contributions coming 
from the paraventricular, medial preoptic, tuberal, and suprachiasmatic 
nuclei. These hormones are transported to the hypophyseal portal sys-
tem and to the anterior lobe where they enter the vascular system.
Clinical Correlations
Due to its location, lesions of the pituitary may present as endocrine 
disorders, visual deﬁcits (bitemporal hemianopia is most common), fea-
tures of increased intracranial pressure, diplopia, and headache related 
to activation of nerves of the diaphragma sellae. In addition, lesions of 
the pituitary may be classiﬁed according to size: microadenomas (less 
than or equal to 1.0 cm in size) or macroadenomas (greater than 1.0 cm), 
or as secreting (excess hormone production) or nonsecreting (no hor-
mone secretion). Hypersecreting tumors are those commonly seen in 
the clinical setting.
8-61
Excessive production of growth hormone may produce either gigant-
ism or acromegaly. In the former, excessive hormone is produced before 
the growth plates have closed; the patient is abnormally tall and has 
large, but weak, muscles. In the latter, excessive hormone is produced 
after the growth plates have closed; the patient has large facial features, 
a large nose and thick lips, large hands and feet, and cardiac problems 
(hypertension, heart failure).
A female patient that presents with headache (common), visual deﬁ-
cits, amenorrhea, and vertigo (“dizziness”) may have an empty sella 
syndrome. This may result from increased intracranial pressure, an 
untreated pituitary tumor, or arachnoid herniation into the sella. The 
pituitary may be compressed or displaced.
Excessive production of corticotropin results in Cushing disease. The 
patient has truncal obesity, a rounded (“moonlike”) face, hypertension, 
acne, osteoporosis, violet stretch marks, and diabetes mellitus. Exces-
sive production of luteinizing hormone may result in hypogonadism in 
males (testes may be present, but may not function normally) or disrup-
tion of the ovarian cycle in females.
Excessive production of prolactin in females results in gallactorrhea 
(milk production when not pregnant) and amenorrhea (absent men-
strual cycles). Hyperprolactinemia in men may be signaled by infertility, 
decreased libido, or a combination of these signs and symptoms.
A patient presents with frequent urination (polyuria) and the need for 
large amounts of water (polydipsia), particularly cold water, following 
an automobile collision. CT reveals a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 
consequent brain swelling within the skull. Shearing of the infundibu-
lar stalk and resultant diabetes insipidus (DI), in this case, may relate 
to: 1) sudden violent movement of the brain within the skull; 2) brain 
swelling in a supratentotrial compartment with a shift from one side to 
the other; or 3) transtentorial (central) herniation, in which the brain is 
extruded downward through the tentorial notch (see Chapter 9). Basal 
skull fracture involving the sella turcica or the clivus may cause DI due 
to vascular compromise; clivus fractures may also damage the larger 
vertebrobasilar arteries. In addition, DI may be a consequence of hem-
orrhage into the pituitary, or into a tumor located within the pituitary.
Excessive production of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) pro-
duces hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels and decreased urine 
excretion) and natriuresis (enhanced excretion of sodium in the urine). 
These patients may have hypotension, dehydration, headache, or may 
have more serious problems, such as coma and seizures.
Review of Blood Supply to the Pituitary Gland
The arterial blood supply to the pituitary comes from the inferior hypo-
physeal arteries (branches of the cavernous part of the internal carotid) 
and from the superior hypophyseal arteries (branches of the cerebral 
part of the internal carotid, A1, and P1). The venous drainage is via the 
hypophyseal portal system and inferior hypophyseal veins into locally 
adjacent dural sinuses.

Herniation Syndromes: 
Brain and Spinal Discs
Introduction and Compartments
The cranial cavity contains brain, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), and blood 
(within vessels) all within a vault of unforgiving bone. This is good in 
that it offers essential protection to the soft, almost gelatinous, brain 
when there is a minor bump to the head. At the same time, this is bad 
when there is trauma to the skull that may result in brain damage 
(resultant edema, bleeding) or an intracranial event (hemorrhage, rap-
idly growing mass); all of which may increase intracranial pressure that 
attempts to displace the brain.
As a mass increases in size within a particular intracranial compart-
ment, it displaces CSF and, to a lesser extent, blood within vessels, 
and raises the pressure within that compartment when compared to 
the adjacent compartments. When a mass increases to the point where 
the CSF space is exhausted, the pressure differential between the com-
partment containing the mass (higher) and the adjacent compartments 
(lower) may result in a herniation of brain from the region of higher 
pressure into one of lower pressure. These events, and resultant deﬁcits, 
are called herniation syndromes.
A wide variety of clinical events may precede the development of a 
herniation syndrome, such as hemorrhage (epidural, subdural, paren-
chymatous), mass lesion/tumor (primary or secondary), trauma, brain 
infarcts or abscess, infections, and a variety of metabolic conditions. 
One thing that is common, to varying degrees, to all of these, is the 
brain edema that usually accompanies these events; it can be a major 
element in the resulting herniation or its propagation.
The supratentorial space, the space above the tentorium, is divided 
into right (Figure 9-1, pink) and left (Figure 9-1, blue) compartments by 
the midline position of the falx cerebri. The space below the tentorium 
cerebelli is not subdivided but presents as a single infratentorial com-
partment (Figure 9-1, green). The continuation of the supratentorial 
compartments with the infratentorial compartment is through the ten-
torial notch, which contains the midbrain and large vessels. Although 
not speciﬁcally described as a compartment, the cranial subarachnoid 
space, and its CSF, is continuous with the spinal subarachnoid space 
and represents the anatomical basis for herniation through the foramen 
magnum (Figure 9-2).
While brain herniation syndromes may be characterized on the basis 
of their own speciﬁc features, one herniation may morph, with clinical 
deterioration, into another. For example, a subfalcine herniation may, as 
the mass enlarges, become a central herniation, or a central herniation 
contributes to a tonsillar herniation. In a real sense, brain herniation is a 
dynamic process that may change as the clinical picture changes.
Spinal cord injuries, particularly those resulting from extruded 
intervertebral discs, or trauma, share similarities with brain herniations: 
mechanical impingement on neural structures with predictable deﬁcits. 
Recognizing these features in common, selected samples of intervertebral 
disc extrusions and other spinal cord syndromes or lesions are included 
here to offer a more complete picture of this important clinical problem.

Subfalcine (cingulate or falcine) herniation. An expanding mass 
in the supratentorial compartment on one side may force the 
cingulate gyrus against, and/or under, the edge of the falx cerebri (A). 
These lesions are frequently located in the more superior area of the 
hemisphere, such as the parietal lobe, but may also occur in parietof-
rontal areas.
Several features generally characterize a subfalcine herniation. First, 
with the exception of the general symptoms of increased intracranial 
pressure (headache, nausea, vomiting), the event may be initially 
“silent” in that the patient has no long tract or focal signs. Second, this 
herniation may compromise the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) against 
the falx cerebri on the side of the mass, on the opposite side, or on both 
sides (A, B). The resulting deﬁcits reﬂect damage to the lower extremity 
9-3
regions of the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (weakness, 
loss of proprioception and exteroceptive sense in a lower extremity). 
Depending on which ACA is occluded, the deﬁcits may be on the side of 
the mass, the opposite side, or bilateral. Third, as the herniation 
progresses, the brain is pushed underneath the edge of the falx cerebri 
(A, C). When this takes place, the superior areas of the diencephalon 
may be involved and the internal cerebral veins may be compressed 
resulting in venous stasis, edema, or venous infarcts in the areas served 
by these veins. Fourth, with enlargement of the mass, a subfalcine her-
niation may evolve into a central, or transtentorial, herniation with the 
consequent clinical deﬁcits. Fifth, damage to the cingulate gyrus may 
also result in alterations in behavior, but these are masked by other 
more obvious deﬁcits.

Diencephalic stage of central herniation. Expanding masses in 
frontal, parietal, and, to a lesser degree, occipital lobes, or in the 
central region of the hemisphere (basal nuclei, internal capsule, lateral 
thalamus) may result in brain displacement toward the opposite side: 
this is the diencephalic (thalamic) stage of central herniation (A, B).
A supratentorial mass within the hemisphere that enlarges and 
impinges on the contralateral side of the brain will result in a cascade of 
deﬁcits characteristic of the structures damaged. The affected hemi-
sphere is signiﬁcantly swollen, sulci usually obliterated, and the midline 
clearly effaced (A, B). These signs and symptoms include a decrease in 
the level consciousness (reﬂecting compromise of the ascending reticu-
lar activating system), potential onset of diabetes insipidus (if the pitui-
tary stalk is damaged as the brain shifts), a general increase in muscle 
tone, and respiratory changes accompany these motor symptoms. 
Breathing may initially be normal with occasional yawns or sighs but 
followed by the potential onset of ascending and descending rhythmic 
patterns characteristic of Cheyne-Stokes respiration (breathing that 
increases in depth then decreases followed by a period of apnea). In this 
stage, the pupils are small but minimally reactive, both eyes rotate to 
9-4
the side opposite a head rotation (doll’s eyes maneuver), and both eyes 
look toward the ear irrigated by cold water (cold caloric test). A nox-
ious stimulus results in a movement of the upper extremity to deﬂect the 
offending source. Based on the extent of the damage the patient may 
have unilateral, contralateral, or bilateral Babinski reﬂexes (extension, 
fanning of the toes), and a hemiparesis of upper and lower extremities 
(compromise of corticospinal ﬁbers; the Babinski is on the same side as 
the weakness).
A likely outcome of an enlarging supratentorial mass is decorticate 
rigidity (also called decorticate posturing). The level of consciousness, 
alertness, and arousability is decreased. The lower extremities, trunk 
and neck musculature are extended (opisthotonos, representing 
increased activity in reticulospinal and vestibulospinal ﬁbers to exten-
sor motor neurons in the spinal cord), and the upper extremities are 
ﬂexed (increased activity in rubrospinal ﬁbers to ﬂexor motor neurons 
in the cervical spinal cord). With the removal of cortical modulation 
(decortication), brainstem nuclei are driven to higher levels of activity 
by infratentorial centers such as the cerebellum, vestibular nuclei, and 
spinal cord.

Transtentorial or central herniation. As a supratentorial mass 
enlarges, and in the absence of an opportunity to control or 
reverse the pressure, the brain will be displaced downward through the 
tentorial notch; this is transtentorial or central herniation (A, B). The 
brain is displaced from a region of greater pressure (above the tento-
rium) into a region of lower pressure (below the tentorium).
When the capacity of the supratentorial compartments is exceeded, 
the brain will herniate downward and compromises the midbrain and 
even lower levels. In this example, a large supratentorial mass (C) 
extends through the tentorial notch and into the brainstem (D, E). This 
may happen suddenly or unexpectedly, or be predictable based on the 
clinical deterioration during the diencephalic/thalamic stage.
The decorticate rigidity, that may appear during the diencephalic 
stage, may convert to decerebrate rigidity (also called decerebrate pos-
turing). In this situation, there is total body rigidity; the lower 
9-5
extremities, trunk and neck, and the upper extremities are extended. 
This reﬂects increased inﬂuence of vestibulospinal and reticulospinal 
tracts, especially the latter, on extensor spinal motor neurons, and loss 
of the red nucleus (midbrain damage) and its inﬂuence on cervical ﬂexor 
spinal motor neurons. Consequently, spinal extensor motor neuron 
activity prevails.
Respiratory patterns are irregular and may range from tachypnea 
(rapid breathing) to Cheyne-Stokes (breathing that increases in depth 
then decreases followed by a period of apnea). The pupils are ﬁxed, 
dilated to midposition, or irregular in shape, and there may be visual 
losses resultant to compression of the posterior cerebral artery within 
the tentorial notch. Head rotation or cold caloric irrigation of an ear 
generally results in dysconjugate eye movements. After central hernia-
tion has occurred, the chance of a meaningful recovery is low (less than 
5%) even if a treatment can be instituted and is successful.

Uncal herniation. A rapidly expanding mass, such as a 
hematoma, neoplasm, or infarction with resultant edema, 
located in the temporal lobe may result in uncal herniation. The uncus, 
and frequently portions of the parahippocampal gyrus, are extruded 
over the edge of tentorium cerebelli, through the tentorial notch, and 
impinge on the midbrain (A). An early sign is a dilated pupil that 
responds slowly; if unilateral, the side of the dilated pupil predicts the 
side of the herniation in about 90% of cases. The dilated pupil may also 
be ﬁxed, unresponsive to stimuli. Respiration is usually normal (eup-
neic) in early stages, and there is an appropriate response to a noxious 
stimuli; the patent may hyperventilate as herniation progresses. Conse-
quent to pupillary dilation, most eye movement is absent (third nerve 
palsy), and eye movements in head rotation or cold caloric irrigation 
may be dysconjugate. In the same interval, the patient may become 
hemiparetic (damage to corticospinal ﬁbers in the crus cerebri) with a 
Babinski reﬂex on the hemiparetic side, experience visual deﬁcits (com-
pression of the posterior cerebral artery serving the visual cortex), and 
9-6
have a decreased level of consciousness or arousability (somnolence or 
stupor).
There are two variations on this theme. The ﬁrst is a herniation that 
damages the midbrain (third root, crus cerebri) on the side of the hernia-
tion resulting in oculomotor deﬁcits on the side of the herniation and 
hemiparesis on the contralateral side (with additional symptoms) (B, D). 
This is essentially a Weber syndrome; a superior crossed (or alternate) 
hemiplegia. The second is a herniation that shifts the midbrain from one 
side toward the other, damaging the oculomotor root on the side of the 
herniation and causing damage to the crus cerebri (and corticospinal ﬁb-
ers) on the opposite side (C, E) sometimes by impinging on the edge of 
the tentorium (E). This results in oculomotor deﬁcits on the side of the 
herniation and a hemiparesis of the upper and lower extremities on the 
same side. The damage to the crus opposite the herniation is the cause of 
the corticospinal deﬁcits on the same side as the oculomotor deﬁcits (C). 
This is a Kernohan syndrome, also called the Kernohan phenomenon. In 
this case, the corticospinal deﬁcits are a false localizing sign.

Upward cerebellar herniation. A posterior fossa (infratentorial) 
mass, particularly one in the cerebellum, may force brain struc-
tures upward through the tentorial incisure (notch) (A). A lesion in the 
posterior fossa may present with cardinal signs/symptoms of increased 
intracranial pressure: headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. In addition, 
an abducens palsy and papilledema (the latter seen after 4–6 days) may 
be present; both are exacerbated by increased intracranial pressure. In 
this example, the lesion involves primarily medial cerebellar structures 
with a consequent presentation of a wide-based gait, titubation, and 
vertigo (B, C).
Additional potential consequences of this type of lesion include the 
following: entrapment of the PCA (potential visual deﬁcits, homonymous 
9-7
hemianopia), compression of the SCA between the tentorium and the 
cerebellum (infarct of cerebellar cortex and nuclei, cerebellar motor 
signs/symptoms), occlusion of the cerebral aqueduct (increased intracra-
nial pressure, hydrocephalus), and compression of the caudal midbrain 
(impaired voluntary upward gaze, horizontal gaze intact; the Parinaud 
syndrome). Recognizing that about 450 cc of cerebrospinal ﬂuid is pro-
duced every 24 hours in a normal healthy individual, and much of this in 
the lateral and third ventricles, a sudden occlusion of the cerebral aque-
duct may quickly become a medical emergency. The medical urgency is 
created because only about 150 cc (of the 450 cc) of cerebrospinal ﬂuid is 
needed at any given time; the remainder must circulate and be reab-
sorbed, or signiﬁcant complications may occur.

Tonsillar herniation. Herniation of the cerebellar tonsils 
through the foramen magnum may be a sequel to an enlarging 
cerebellar mass (A) or to a supratentorial lesion descending through the 
tentorial notch and resulting in a pressure cone directed toward the 
foramen magnum. There are, however, situations where the tonsils may 
be found in the foramen, and below, without neurologic signs or symp-
toms. This may be the case where the tonsils descended during develop-
ment or over long periods of time.
Normally the posterior fossa cisterns are open and the foramen mag-
num contains the medulla, vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar 
arteries, and CSF (B, C, G). With herniation, the tonsils descend 
9-8
through the cistern magna and into the foramen and eventually the spi-
nal subarachnoid space (D–F, H).
Sudden herniation may compress the medulla, compromise car-
diac and respiratory centers therein, and result in rapid clinical 
deterioration. Initially, there is an immediate increase in blood pres-
sure, followed by equally rapid increases in heart rate (tachycardia) 
and respiratory rate (tachypnea), followed by an equally rapid 
decline. Tonsillar herniation may occur suddenly and may be rap-
idly fatal if not treated as a medical emergency. Lumbar puncture 
(LP) should generally be avoided if elevated intracranial pressure is 
suspected.

Spinal cord damaged
Central cord syndrome. The normal cervical spinal cord is oval 
shaped, located within the dura, and separated from the bony 
vertebral canal by an epidural space (A, C). The central cord syndrome 
is an incomplete spinal cord injury (some motor/sensory function sur-
vives three or more segments below the level of the injury) and is the 
most commonly seen incomplete spinal cord injury. Contributing fac-
tors to this syndrome are hyperextension of the vertebral column (com-
mon in cervical levels) in older patients with stenosis of the vertebral 
canal complicated by osteophytes or hypertrophy of the ligamentum ﬂa-
vum (B, D). In younger patients, the hyperextension may occur during 
sport injuries or blows to the face/forehead with or without fractures.
A central cord syndrome presents as weakness of the extremities 
(greater in the upper extremity [UE], less in the lower extremity [LE]), 
9-9
irregular sensory deﬁcits (pain and thermal sense), and urinary reten-
tion. These deﬁcits correlate primarily with damage to the anterior 
horn at cervical levels and to the medial ﬁbers of the lateral corticos-
pinal tract (bilateral weakness of the UEs), damage to the anterola-
teral system taking into account its somatotopy (irregular loss of pain 
and thermal sense), and descending visceromotor ﬁbers in the central 
areas of the cord (sphincter dysfunction/urine retention). Compro-
mise of the anterior spinal artery may be a contributing factor in some 
cases. As these patients recover (about 90% may ambulate with 
assistance in 4–6 days) the LEs come back ﬁrst, the bladder next, fol-
lowed by the UEs, with sensation returning intermittently. Younger 
patients fare much better than elderly patients (about 95%+ versus 
40%+ recovery).

Anterior cord syndrome. The morphological features of the 
cervical spinal cord and its relationships are described in Fig-
ure 9-9 and further shown here (A, B). The anterior cord syndrome 
(ACS) not only involves the territory of the anterior spinal artery, but is 
more inclusive in that it involves all cord regions except the posterior 
columns; this is also an incomplete spinal cord injury since there is sur-
viving sensory function (discriminative touch, vibratory sense, proprio-
ception in the posterior columns) below the level of the lesion. A 
common cause of ACS is vascular surgery, particularly that which may 
compromise branches of the aorta that ultimately serve the spinal cord. 
Precipitating events may also include anterior spinal cord compression 
pursuant to trauma resulting in intervertebral disc or bone fragments 
9-10
(from a fracture of a vertebral body) that impinge on the cord (C). This 
pattern of compression may compromise the anterior spinal artery, the 
arterial vasocorona on the anterolateral surface of the cord, and/or the 
cord itself.
The deﬁcits present as paralysis below the level of the lesion (bilat-
eral corticospinal ﬁber damage): paraplegia if at thoracic cord levels 
and below, quadriplegia if at cervical cord levels. Additional deﬁcits 
include a bilateral loss of pain and thermal sensation (bilateral ALS 
damage), and bowel and bladder dysfunction (descending visceromotor 
ﬁbers). Posterior column function (proprioception, discriminative 
touch, vibratory sense) remains intact. The prognosis is grave; only 
about 15% recover to a functional level.

Exiting roots at cervical levels. The cervical spinal nerves exit 
the spinal cord and course laterally, and just slightly caudad, 
to their respective intervertebral spaces (see Figures 2-1 and 2-2). This 
relationship means that the vast majority of disc herniations in cervical 
levels involve the exiting root. The cervical spinal nerves exit the cord 
superior to their respectively numbered vertebrae; C1 between the C1 
vertebrae and skull base, the C4 root above the C4 vertebrae at the 
C3–C4 interspace, the C6 root above the C6 vertebrae at the C5–C6 
interspace, and so on (A). The C8 root exits between the C7 and the T1 
vertebrae; consequently, below T1 all spinal nerves exit caudal to their 
respectively numbered  vertebrae (e.g., the T1 root below the T1 verte-
brae at the T1–T2 interspace).
9-11
An example of a lesion involving an exiting root is a disc protrusion 
at the C5–C6 interspace that impinges on the C6 root (B–D). The 
extruded disc clearly invades the intervertebral space on the right side, 
especially when compared to the left (D, E). In this case, the deﬁcits 
reﬂect damage to the C6 root and include weakness of forearm and 
wrist extensors, inability to ﬂex (dorsiﬂex) the wrist, and sensory loss in 
the C6 dermatome (back of the shoulder, lateral aspect of UE, thumb). 
The losses reﬂect the damage to the root at that level; not above or 
below; the root exiting at that level.

Exiting and traversing roots at lumbosacral levels. Depend-
ing on the direction of the disc extrusion, herniations at the 
lumbosacral levels may damage either an exiting root or traversing 
roots (A, B).
A herniated lumbar disc that protrudes superiorly or laterally and 
into the subarticular space of one intervertebral level damages the exit-
ing root at that level; this root has a limited distribution. For example, a 
herniation superiorly or far laterally at the L3–L4 interspace damages 
the L3 root resulting in weakness of knee extension, pain over the ante-
rior thigh and decreased sensation on the medial distal thigh, and a 
diminished knee jerk (patellar tendon) reﬂex (A, C).
Lesions that may damage traversing roots are commonly seen at 
lumbosacral levels; most disc extrusions occur at L4–L5 or L5–S1, 
9-12
those extending posterolaterally may compress traversing roots. This 
reﬂects the descending nature of roots at these levels to form the cauda 
equina (see Figure 2-4). For example, a disc extruded medial to the sub-
articular zone/space at the L4–L5 interspace may avoid the L4 root (the 
root at that level) and compress roots that are descending to exit at 
lower levels such as L5 and S1–S5 (A, D). In this example, the deﬁcits 
reﬂect damage to these traversing roots resulting in weakness of knee 
ﬂexion; plantarﬂexion of the ankle and extension of the great toe; loss 
of the Achilles, bulbocavernosus, and anal-cutaneous (anal wink) 
reﬂexes; and a loss of sensation in these respective dermatomes (but-
tock, posterior thigh and leg, lateral leg, and most of foot). These losses 
reﬂect damage to roots descending and exiting at lower levels, not to 
roots at the level of the extruded disc.

Cauda equina syndrome. The lumbar cistern is located between 
about the L1/L2 and S2 vertebral levels and contains descend-
ing anterior and posterior roots that collectively form the cauda equina 
(A, B). This cistern is the primary avenue for retrieving a sample of cere-
brospinal ﬂuid for diagnostic purposes.
Intervertebral disc extrusions take place at the L4–L5 and at the L5–
S1 levels in about the same numbers (about 45% each level). Large disc 
ruptures at the midline at L4–L5 are a major cause of cauda equina 
syndrome, followed by other events such as metastatic tumors, bone 
fragments from spinal trauma, spinal epidural hematoma, or the com-
plication of infections (vascular compromise, compression). The 
9-13
protruded disc, or other mass/fragments within the vertebral column, 
may compress the dural sac and the roots located therein (C–E).
Bladder and bowel problems (urinary retention, overﬂow inconti-
nence; decreased anal sphincter tone) are early and usually consist-
ent ﬁndings. Other characteristic features include saddle anesthesia 
(sensory loss over perineum, genitals, anus, buttocks, and inner 
thighs, reﬂecting the Coc root and S2–S5 roots), lower extremity 
weakness (damage to multiple motor roots), potential loss of the 
Achilles reﬂex (S1 level), pain in the lower back or sciatica (pain 
radiating down the posterior thigh and leg) and, sexual dysfunction 
(a later ﬁnding).

Internal carotid angiogram (left lateral projection, arterial

cially good ﬁlling of the ophthalmic artery (B). The ophthalmic artery 
leaves the cerebral part of the internal carotid and enters the orbit via 
the optic canal. This vessel gives rise to the central artery of the retina, 
which is an important source of blood supply to the retina. Occlusion 
of the ophthalmic artery may result in blindness in the eye on that side. 
10-1
The terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery anastomose with super-
ﬁcial vessels around the orbit. The venous drainage of the orbit gener-
ally mirrors that of the arteries serving the orbit. Orbital veins receive 
tributaries from the face and coalesce to form the ophthalmic vein, 
which ends in the cavernous sinus. This is a potential route through 
which infections of the face around the orbit, or within the orbit, may 
access the central nervous system. Compare with Figures 2-12 (p. 17), 
2-21 (p. 23), 2-25 (p. 25), and 3-2 (p. 47).

ostriate vein (A) at this location is also called the superior thalamostriate 
vein. The junction of the superior thalamostriate vein with the internal 
cerebral vein is called the venous angle (A). The interventricular foramen 
10-2
is located immediately rostral to this point; small tumors at this location 
(such as a colloid cyst, or a small choroid plexus papilloma) may block 
the ﬂow of cerebrospinal ﬂuid from one or both lateral ventricles and 
result in hydrocephalus (see Figure 2-26 on p. 26 for a colloid cyst and 
enlarged ventricles). Compare these images with the drawings of veins 
and sinuses in Figures 2-13 (p. 17), 2-19 (p. 21), and 2-28 (p. 27).

Internal carotid angiogram (anterior–posterior projection,

and middle cerebral arteries and the location of lenticulostriate 
branches. The A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery is located 
between the internal carotid bifurcation and the anterior communicat-
ing artery. The distal portion of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) 
immediately rostral to the anterior communicating artery and inferior 
to the rostrum of the corpus callosum is the A2 segment (infracallosal). 
The portion of the ACA arching around the genu of the corpus callo-
sum is the A3 segment (precallosal) and the A4 (supracallosal) and A5 
10-3
(postcallosal) segments are located superior (above), and caudal, to the 
corpus callosum.
The M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery is located between the 
internal carotid bifurcation and the point at which this vessel branches 
into superior and inferior trunks on the insular cortex. As branches of 
the middle cerebral artery pass over the insular cortex, they are desig-
nated as M2, as M3 when these branches are located on the inner sur-
face of the frontal, parietal, and temporal opercula, and as M4 where 
they exit the lateral sulcus and fan out over the lateral aspect of the cer-
ebral hemisphere. Compare with vascular ﬁgures in Chapter 2.

Internal carotid angiogram (anterior–posterior projection,

the arching shapes of the superior and inferior sagittal sinuses to full 
advantage. In many individuals, the superior sagittal sinus turns pre-
dominately to the right at the conﬂuence to form the right transverse 
sinus (Figure 10-6 on p. 315), and the straight sinus turns mainly to the 
10-4
left to form the left transverse sinus. In some individuals, there is a true 
conﬂuence of sinuses where both transverse sinuses and the superior 
sagittal and the straight sinuses meet. Note the other venous structures 
in this image and compare with the arterial phase shown in Figure 10-3 
(facing page) and the images in Figures 10-5 and 10-6 on pp. 314–315.

Digital subtraction image of an internal carotid angiogram

early in the venous phase (greater ﬁlling of cortical veins), whereas 
image (B) is later in the venous phase (greater ﬁlling of the sinuses and 
jugular vein). Both images are of the same patient.
The jugular bulb is a dilated portion of internal jugular vein (IJV) in 
the jugular fossa at the point where the sigmoid sinus is continuous 
with the IJV; this continuity is through the jugular foramen. The jugular 
10-5
foramen also contains the roots of cranial nerves IX, X, and XI, the 
continuation of inferior petrosal sinus with the IJV and several small 
arteries. There are several syndromes that signify damage to the con-
tents of the jugular foramen (such as the Vernet syndrome), or damage 
to these structures plus the hypoglossal root (Collet-Sicard syndrome). 
Recall that the jugular foramen and the hypoglossal canal are immedi-
ately adjacent, one to the other, in the posterior fossa. Compare with 
Figures 2-16 (p. 19) and 2-19 (p. 21).

A vertebral artery angiogram (anterior–posterior projection,

though the injection is into the left vertebral, there is bilateral ﬁlling of 
the vertebral arteries and branches of the basilar artery. The thalamop-
erforating arteries are important branches of P1 that generally serve ros-
tral portions of the diencephalon.
The root of the oculomotor (third) nerve, after exiting the  
inferior aspect of the midbrain, characteristically passes through the  
10-8
interpeduncular cistern and between the superior cerebellar and poste-
rior cerebral arteries en route to its exit from the skull through the supe-
rior orbital ﬁssure. In this position the third nerve may be damaged by 
large aneurysms of the rostral end of the basilar artery (called the basi-
lar tip, or basilar head) that impinge on the nerve root. Compare with 
Figures 2-21 (p. 23), 3-2B (p. 47), and 3-3C (p. 48).

view (B). The portion of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) located 
between the internal carotid artery and the anterior communicating 
artery is the A1 segment (precommunicating). The part of the ACA 
10-9
immediately rostral to the anterior communicating artery and inferior 
to the rostrum of the corpus callosum is the A2 segment (infracallosal). 
The portion of the ACA arching around the genu of the corpus callosum 
is the A3 segment (precallosal) and the A4 (supracallosal) and A5 (post-
callosal) segments are located superior to (above), and caudal to, the 
corpus callosum. Compare these images with arteries and veins as 
depicted in Figures 2-18 and 2-19 (p. 21), 2-21 (p. 23), and 2-24 (p. 25).

MRA images, in the axial plane, of the vessels at the base 
of the brain forming much of the cerebral arterial circle (of 
Willis) (A,B). Note the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries 
as they extend outward from the circle. The upper image is from a nor-
mal individual, and the lower image is from a patient with a vestibular 
schwannoma. These tumors are generally slow growing, usually present 
(95%+ of the time) with hearing deﬁcits (difﬁculty discriminating 
10-10
sounds, hearing loss), and, if especially large (generally, >2.5 cm in size), 
may involve the trigeminal root with a corresponding sensory loss on 
the face. Additional deﬁcits include tinnitus, dysequilibrium, headache, 
facial numbness (about 30% of cases), and facial weakness (interest-
ingly enough, only about 10%–14% of cases). Descriptions of the seg-
ments of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries are found 
on pp. 19, 23, 27, 37, and 312.

Overview (A) of the arteries in the neck that serve the brain 
(internal carotid and vertebral) and of their main terminal 
branches (anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery, vertebro-
basilar system) as seen in an MRA (anterior–posterior view). In approx-
imately 40%–45% of individuals, the left vertebral artery is larger, as 
seen here, and in about 4%–7% of individuals, one or the other of the 
vertebral arteries may be hypoplastic as seen here on the patient’s right. 
The MRI in (B) is a detailed view of the vertebrobasilar system from the 
point where the vertebral arteries exit the transverse foramen to where 
the basilar artery bifurcates into the posterior cerebral arteries. Com-
pare this image with Figure 2-21 on p. 23.

The vertebral artery (VA) is generally described as being composed 
of four segments sometimes designated as V1 to V4. The ﬁrst segment 
(V1) is between the VA origin from the subclavian artery and the 
entrance of VA into the ﬁrst transverse foramen (usually C6); the sec-
ond segment (V2) is that part of VA ascending through the transverse 
foramen of C6–C2; the third segment (V3) is between the exit of VA 
from the transverse foramen of the axis and the dura at the foramen 
magnum (this includes the loop of the VA that passes through the trans-
verse foramen of C1/the atlas); the fourth segment (V4) enters the poste-
rior fossa and joins its counterpart to form the basilar artery.

here are two essential goals of a student studying human neu-
robiology, or, for that matter, the student of any of the medical 
sciences. The ﬁrst is to gain the knowledge base and diagnos-
tic skills to become a competent health care professional. Addressing 
the medical needs of the patient with insight, skill, and compassion is 
paramount. The second is to successfully negotiate whatever examina-
tion procedures are used in a given setting. These may be standard class 
examinations, Subject National Board Examination (now used/required 
in many courses), the USMLE Step 1 Examination (required of all U.S. 
medical students), or simply the desire, on the part of the student, for 
self-assessment.
The questions in this chapter are prepared in two general styles. 
First, there are study or review questions that test general knowledge 
concerning the structure and function of the central nervous system. 
Second, there are single one-best-answer questions in the USMLE Style 
that use a patient vignette approach in the stem. These questions have 
been carefully reviewed for clinical accuracy and relevance as used in 
these examples. At the end of each explained answer, page numbers 
appear in parentheses that specify where the correct answer, be it in a 
ﬁgure or the text, may be found. In order to make this a fruitful learning

exercise, some answers may contain additional relevant information to 
extend the educational process.
In general, the questions are organized by individual chapters, 
although Chapters 1 and 2 are combined. Reference(s) to the page (or 
pages) containing the correct answer are usually to the chapter(s) from 
which the question originated. However, recognizing that neuroscience 
is dynamic and three-dimensional, some answers contain references to 
chapters other than that from which the question originated. This pro-
vides a greater level of integration by bringing a wider range of informa-
tion to bear on a single question. Correct diagnosis of the neurologically 
compromised patient may also require inclusion of concepts gained in 
other basic science courses. In this regard, a few questions, and their 
answers, may include such additional basic concepts.
This is not an all-inclusive list of questions, but rather a sampling 
that covers a variety of neuroanatomical and clinically relevant points. 
There is certainly a much larger variety of questions that can be devel-
oped from the topics covered in this atlas. It is hoped that this sample 
will give the user a good idea of how basic neuroscience information 
correlates with a range of clinically relevant topics and how questions 
on these topics may be developed.

60. Which of the following descriptive phrases best describes the con-
stellation of signs and symptoms seen in this man?
(A) Alternating hemianesthesia
(B) Brown-Séquard syndrome
(C) Inferior alternating (crossed) hemiplegia
(D) Middle alternating (crossed) hemiplegia
(E) Superior alternating (crossed) hemiplegia
Answers
 1. Answer B: The inferior frontal gyrus consists of the pars orbitalis 
(Brodmann area 47), pars triangularis (area 45), and pars opercu-
laris (area 44). A lesion located primarily in areas 44 and 45 in the 
dominant hemisphere will result in a nonﬂuent (Broca, or motor) 
aphasia. The supramarginal (area 40) and angular (area 39) gyri 
represent what is called the Wernicke area, and the middle frontal 
gyrus contains areas 6 and 8. The lingual gyrus is located below the 
calcarine sulcus; the superior quadrant of the opposite visual ﬁelds 
is represented in this gyrus (area 17). (pp. 12, 16)
 2. Answer E: The most common cause of blood in the subarachnoid 
space is resultant to trauma; the second most common cause is rup-
ture of an intracranial aneurysm. Patients who experience rupture 
of an intracranial aneurysm frequently complain of an intense, sud-
den headache (“the most horrible headache I have ever had”). Acute 
blood in the subarachnoid space will appear white to very white on 
CT; this blood is hyperdense. This will contrast with the medium 
gray of the brain and the black of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) in the 
ventricles. The degree of white may vary somewhat, based on the rel-
ative concentration of blood, from very white (concentrated blood) 
to white (mostly blood, some CSF), to very light gray (mixture of 
blood and CSF). (pp. 1–3)
 3. Answer C: The deep middle cerebral vein is located on the insu-
lar cortex and, by joining with the anterior cerebral vein, forms 
the basal vein of Rosenthal. The superﬁcial middle cerebral vein 
is located on the lateral aspect of the hemisphere in the vicinity of 
the lateral sulcus, arches around the temporal lobe, and joins the 
cavernous sinus. The vein of Labbé drains the lateral aspect of the 
hemisphere into the transverse sinus. (pp. 17, 19, 21, 311)
 4. Answer E: Branches of the superior cerebellar artery are most fre-
quently involved in cases of trigeminal neuralgia that are presumably 
of vascular origin. The posterior cerebral artery and its larger branches 
serve the midbrain–diencephalic junction or join the medial surface 
of the hemisphere. The basilar artery serves the basilar pons and the 
anterior inferior cerebellar artery serves the caudal midbrain, inner ear, 
and the inferior surface of the cerebellar surface. The basal vein drains 
the medial portions of the hemisphere and passes through the ambient 
cistern to enter the great cerebral vein (of Galen). (pp. 23, 49)
 5. Answer D: This man’s deﬁcits, loss of most (but not all) eye move-
ment and dilation of the pupil, are on the right side. These losses, 
with no other deﬁcits, indicate damage to the oculomotor nerve; 
this nerve exits the cranial cavity via the superior orbital ﬁssure. 
This ﬁssure also transmits the ophthalmic nerve. The foramen ovale 
transmits the mandibular nerve (plus ﬁbers to the masticatory mus-
cles) and the foramen rotundum transmits the maxillary nerve. 
After the maxillary nerve passes through the rotundum, it shifts 
course and enters the orbit via the inferior orbital ﬁssure. The facial 
nerve passes through the stylomastoid foramen. (pp. 22–24, 44–45)
 6. Answer A: In this patient the pontine lesion is on the right side. 
This results in a paralysis of the right lateral rectus (abducens lower 
(C) Dyspnea
(D) Hyperorality
(E) Hyperphagia
55. Based on the totality of this man’s deﬁcits he is most likely suffering 
from which of the following?
(A) Klüver-Bucy syndrome
(B) Korsakoff syndrome
(C) Senile dementia
(D) Wallenberg syndrome
(E) Wernicke aphasia
Questions 56 and 57 are based on the following patient.
A 23-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department from the 
site of an automobile collision. CT shows fractures of the facial bones 
and evidence of bilateral trauma to the temporal lobes including blood 
is the parahippocampal gyri and hippocampus.
56. As this man recovers, which of the following deﬁcits is likely to be 
the most obvious?
(A) A bilateral sensory loss in the lower body
(B) A loss of immediate and short-term memory
(C) A loss of long-term (remote) memory
(D) Dementia
(E) Dysphagia and dysarthria
57. Assuming that this man also has sustained bilateral injury to the 
Meyer-Archambault loop, which of the following deﬁcits would he 
also most likely have?
(A) Bitemporal hemianopsia
(B) Bilateral inferior quadrantanopia
(C) Bilateral superior quadrantanopia
(D) Left superior quadrantanopia
(E) Right superior quadrantanopia
Questions 58 through 60 are based on the following patient.
A 67-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by his wife. 
She explains that he fell suddenly, could not get out of his bed, and 
complained of feeling nauseated, but did not vomit. The examination 
revealed a left-sided weakness of the upper and lower extremities, a 
lack of most movement of the right eye, and a dilated pupil on the right. 
MRI shows an infarcted area in the brainstem.
58. The weakness of this man’s extremities is explained by damage to 
the axons of cell bodies that are located in which of the following 
regions of the brain?
(A) Left somatomotor cortex
(B) Right anterior paracentral gyrus
(C) Right crus cerebri
(D) Right precentral gyrus
(E) Right somatomotor cortex
59. This man’s dilated pupil is due to damage to which of the following 
ﬁber populations?
(A) Preganglionic ﬁbers from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus
(B) Preganglionic ﬁbers from the inferior salivatory nucleus
(C) Postganglionic ﬁbers from the ciliary ganglion
(D) Postganglionic ﬁbers from the geniculate ganglion
(E) Postganglionic ﬁbers from the superior cervical ganglion

motor neurons) and of the right and left medial recti on attempted 
lateral gaze (damage to the axons of interneurons entering the 
medial longitudinal fasciculus on both sides). The surviving muscle 
is the left lateral rectus. (pp. 53–54)
 7. Answer B: The inﬂammation in meningitis generally occupies the 
subarachnoid space and its minute extensions into the sulci; the 
infection may also extend into cisterns. The commonly used clinical 
terms leptomeningitis (signifying arachnoid + pia) or pia-arachnitis 
reﬂect the fact that this infection is frequently sequestered within 
the subarachnoid space. Meningitis may involve the dura (pachy-
meningitis) and, by extension, invade the minute spaces between 
the pia and brain surface (subpial space). However, these are not 
the main locations of this disease process. Epidural and subdural 
spaces are the result of trauma or some pathologic process and, 
around the brain, are not naturally occurring spaces. (pp. 58–61)
 8. Answer D: The geniculate bodies are tucked-up under the caudal 
and inferior aspect of the pulvinar nucleus(i). The groove between 
the medial geniculate body and pulvinar contains the brachium 
of the superior colliculus. The geniculate bodies and the pulvinar 
have a common blood supply from the thalamogeniculate artery, 
a branch of P2. None of the other choices have a close apposition 
with the geniculate bodies. The anterior thalamic, rostral dorsome-
dial, and subthalamic nuclei do not share a common blood supply 
with the pulvinar. (pp. 25, 31, 81–83, 175)
 9. Answer D: Although this patient initially presented with complete 
motor and sensory losses, some function had returned by 36 hours; 
in this case, the lesion is classiﬁed as an incomplete lesion of the 
spinal cord. Patients with no return of function at 24+ hours and 
no sacral sparing have suffered a lesion classiﬁed as complete and it 
is unlikely that they will recover useful neurological function. In a 
central cord and a large syringomyelia, there is generally sparing of 
posterior column sensations and in a hemisection the loss of motor 
function is on the side of the lesion and the loss of pinprick is on the 
opposite side. (pp. 108–109)
10. Answer E: The short-term loss of function, frequently involving a 
speciﬁc part of the body, is characteristic of a transient ischemic 
attack (commonly called a TIA). The follow-up MRI shows no lesion 
because there has been no permanent damage. TIAs are caused by a 
brief period of inadequate perfusion of a localized region of the nerv-
ous system; recovery is usually rapid and complete. However, TIAs, 
especially if repeated, may be indicative of an impending stroke. 
Hemorrhagic strokes frequently result in some type of long-term 
or permanent deﬁcit, and the central cord syndrome has bilateral 
deﬁcits. A small embolic stroke would be visible on the follow-up 
MRI and, in this patient, would have resulted in a persistent deﬁcit. 
Syringobulbia (cavitation within the medulla) may include long tract 
signs as well as cranial nerve signs. (pp. 108–109, 174–175)
11. Answer C: Weakness of the extremities accompanied by paralysis 
of muscles on the contralateral side of the tongue (seen as a devia-
tion of the tongue to that side on protrusion) indicates a lesion 
in the medulla involving the corticospinal ﬁbers in the pyramid 
and the exiting hypoglossal roots. This is an inferior alternating 
(crossed) hemiplegia. Middle alternating (crossed) hemiplegia refers 
to a lesion of the pontine corticospinal ﬁbers and the root of the 
abducens nerve, and superior alternating (crossed) hemiplegia spec-
iﬁes damage to the oculomotor root and crus cerebri. Alternating 
(alternate, or crossed) hemianesthesia and hemihypesthesia are sen-
sory losses. (pp. 124–125)
12. Answer E: The substantia nigra is located internal to the crus cerebri 
and, in T1-weighted MRI, appears as a darker shade of gray (hypoin-
tense) than does the crus. Loss of the dopamine-containing cells of the 
nigra results in characteristic motor deﬁcits, including a pill-rolling 
(resting) tremor. The red nucleus and the periaqueductal gray are 
located in the midbrain, but do not border on the crus cerebri. The 
brachium of the inferior colliculus is found on the lateral surface of the 
midbrain, and the pretectal area is adjacent to the cerebral aqueduct 
at the midbrain–diencephalic junction. (pp. 179, 181, 183, 258–259)
13. Answer A: The combination of weakness on the left side (corticospi-
nal involvement) and a loss of pain sensation on the right side speciﬁes 
components of Brown-Séquard syndrome. The motor loss is ipsilat-
eral to the damage and the sensory loss is contralateral; second order 
ﬁbers conveying pain information cross in the anterior white com-
missure ascending about two spinal segments in the process. In this 
patient, the lesion is on the left side at about the T6 level; this explains 
the left-sided weakness and the loss of pain sensation on the right 
beginning at the T8 dermatome level. Lesions at T8 or T10 would 
result in a loss of pain sensation beginning, respectively, at dermatome 
levels T10 or T12 on the contralateral side. (pp. 196–199, 210–213)
14. Answer D: A tap on the patellar tendon stretches the muscle spin-
dles in the quadriceps muscles, results in contraction of the same 
muscle group of the thigh, and the knee abruptly swings forward; 
this is mediated through spinal levels L2–L4. This is a monosynap-
tic reﬂex (and a muscle stretch reﬂex) with excitation of the exten-
sor muscles of the leg and, through an interneuron, inhibition of 
leg ﬂexors. The biceps reﬂex is mediated through C5–C6, and the 
triceps through C7–C8. The abdominal reﬂex is mediated through 
spinal levels T8–T10; level S1, with contributions from L5 and S2, 
mediates the ankle reﬂex. (p. 234)
15. Answer D: Lesions in the lateral portions of the brainstem dam-
age descending projections from the hypothalamus to the ipsilateral 
intermediolateral cell column at spinal levels T1–T4, these being 
the hypothalamospinal ﬁbers. The result is Horner syndrome (pto-
sis, myosis, anhydrosis on the face) on the side ipsilateral to the 
lesion. Horner syndrome also may be seen following cervical spinal 
cord lesions. A contralateral hemiplegia is not seen in lesions in 
lateral areas of the brainstem. The other choices are syndromes or 
deﬁcits speciﬁc to medial brainstem areas or to only a particular 
level. (pp. 124–125, 138–139, 152–153, 262–263)
16. Answer D: The afferent limb of the tearing (lacrimal) reﬂex is via 
the trigeminal nerve (pain receptors in the conjunctiva and cornea), 
and the efferent limb travels on the facial nerve; the preganglionic 
parasympathetic cells are in the superior salivatory nucleus, and the 
postganglionic cells are in the pterygopalatine ganglion. The dorsal 
motor vagal nucleus contains preganglionic parasympathetic cells 
that distribute to ganglia in the thorax and abdomen. The genicu-
late ganglion contains the cell bodies of somatic afferent (SA) and 
visceral afferent (VA) ﬁbers that enter the brain on the facial nerve; 
the otic ganglion contains postganglionic parasympathetic cell bod-
ies that serve the parotid gland. (pp. 230–233, 237)
17. Answer D: The paralysis of facial muscles on one side of the face 
(left in this case) with no paralysis of the extremities is a facial hemi-
plegia; this is also commonly known as Bell palsy or facial palsy. 
Hemifacial spasms are irregular contractions of the facial muscles, 
and a central seven (also called a supranuclear facial palsy) refers 
to paralysis of muscles on the lower half of the face contralateral 
to a lesion in the genu of the internal capsule. Alternating (crossed)

hemiplegia describes a motor loss related to a cranial nerve on one 
side of the head and motor deﬁcits of the extremities on the contral-
ateral side of the body. A similar pattern of sensory losses is called 
an alternating hemianesthesia. (pp. 230–233)
18. Answer E: Degenerative changes in the dopamine-containing cells of 
the substantia nigra pars compacta on the right side correlate with a 
left-sided tremor. The altered message through the lenticular nucleus 
and thalamus and on to the motor cortex on the side of the degenera-
tive changes will result in tremor on the opposite (right) side via altered 
messages traveling down the corticospinal tract. The initial symp-
toms of Parkinson disease appear on one side in about 75%–80% of 
patients and extend to bilateral involvement as the disease progresses. 
Bilateral changes in the substantia nigra correlate with bilateral deﬁ-
cits. The globus pallidus does not receive direct nigral input but rather 
input via a nigrostriatal-striatopallidal circuit. (pp. 254–259)
19. Answer A: This inherited disease is Friedreich ataxia; it initially 
appears in children in the age range of 8–15 years and has the 
characteristic deﬁcits described. Huntington disease is inherited, 
but appears in adults (age range at onset 35–45 years); olivopon-
tocerebellar atrophy is an autosomal dominant disease and gives 
rise to a totally different set of deﬁcits. The cause of Parkinson dis-
ease is unclear, but it is probably not inherited and generally seen in 
patients 45+ years of age. The Wallenberg syndrome is a brainstem 
lesion resulting from a vascular occlusion and most commonly char-
acterized by an alternating (crossed) hemianesthesia. (pp. 242–243)
20. Answer C: A fracture through the jugular foramen would poten-
tially damage the glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), and spinal 
accessory (XI) nerves. The major observable deﬁcit would be a loss 
of the efferent limb of the gag reﬂex and paralysis of the ipsilateral 
trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles (drooping of the shoul-
der, difﬁculty elevating the shoulder especially against resistance, 
difﬁculty turning the head to the contralateral side). The patient 
would also experience difﬁculty swallowing (dysphagia) and speak-
ing (dysarthria). Involvement of facial muscles would suggest dam-
age to the internal acoustic or stylomastoid foramina; this would 
also be the case for the efferent limb of the corneal reﬂex. Diplopia 
and ptosis would suggest injury to the superior orbital ﬁssure, as all 
three nerves controlling ocular movement traverse this space. The 
hypoglossal nerve (which supplies muscles of the tongue) passes 
through the hypoglossal canal. (pp. 226–233)
21. Answer C: A relay nucleus is one that receives a speciﬁc type of infor-
mation from a comparatively speciﬁc source, and sends this informa-
tion on to an equally speciﬁc cortical target. The medial geniculate 
nucleus receives mainly auditory information from the cochlear nuclei 
and brainstem auditory relay nuclei and projects to the transverse tem-
poral gyrus. The dorsomedial, centromedian, and pulvinar are asso-
ciation nuclei; these receive input from diverse sources and project to 
equally diverse cortical targets. The thalamic reticular nucleus, while 
not speciﬁcally classiﬁed as either a relay nucleus or an association 
nucleus, basically functions as an association nucleus. (pp. 278–279)
22. Answer E: Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by abnor-
mal, sometimes intermittent, but frequently sustained, contractions 
of the muscles of the trunk and extremities that force the body into 
a twisted posture. Dystonia may be seen in patients with diseases 
of the basal nuclei. Dysmetria, the inability to judge the distance 
and trajectory of a movement, is a feature of cerebellar disease or 
lesions. Dyspnea is difﬁculty breathing; this may result from heart 
and/or lung disorders as well as from neurological disorders, which 
may include central or nerve root lesions. Dysphagia is difﬁculty 
swallowing, dysarthria is difﬁculty speaking, and both may be seen 
together in several central or peripheral lesions. (pp. 254–255)
23. Answer D: A prolactinoma, a tumor that produces excessive amounts 
of prolactin (a hypersecreting tumor), may result in milk production 
in females in the absence of pregnancy. In females, excess luteinizing 
hormone may disrupt the ovarian cycle but not result in milk pro-
duction. Overproduction of corticotrophin results in Cushing dis-
ease; excessive growth hormone results in either gigantism (before 
growth plates close) or acromegaly (after growth plates close). Over-
production of vasopressin inﬂuences urine excretion. (pp. 294–295)
24. Answer C: These three involve the roots of the oculomotor and 
abducens nerve and the nucleus of the abducens nerve, all of which 
innervate extraocular muscles. Each of these patients would experi-
ence some form of diplopia, one of their complaints would be seeing 
“double” or “two of everything.” Aphasia and agnosia are usually 
associated with lesions of the forebrain. Dysarthria and dysphagia 
are frequently seen in medullary lesions, lesions involving the nuclei 
or roots of some cranial nerves of the medulla, but may also be seen 
in patients with large hemispheric strokes. Hemianesthesia may be 
present in patients with lesions at many levels of the central nervous 
system, but not in medially located lesions as is the case with these 
three patients. (pp. 226–229)
25. Answer B: In most instances (approximately 80%–85%), the oph-
thalmic artery originates from the cerebral portion of the internal 
carotid artery just after this parent vessel leaves the cavernous sinus 
and passes through the dura. In a small percentage of cases, the oph-
thalmic artery may originate from other locations on the internal 
carotid artery, including its cavernous portion (about 7%). This ves-
sel does not originate from the petrous portion of the internal carotid 
or from anterior or middle cerebral arteries. (pp. 23, 310, 319)
26. Answer D: The P3 segment lies along the orientation of, and adja-
cent to, the parahippocampal gyrus as this part of the posterior 
cerebral artery courses around the midbrain. Branches of the P3 seg-
ment serve the inferior surface of the temporal lobe, which includes 
much of the laterally adjacent occipitotemporal gyri, and lower 
portions of the optic radiations. The lingual gyrus and the cuneus 
are in the territory of the P4 segment and the orbital gyri are served 
by branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The supe-
rior temporal gyrus is served by M4 branches of the inferior trunk 
of the middle cerebral artery. (pp. 19, 27)
27. Answer C: Treating fusiform aneurysms (in this case on the P3 seg-
ment) present special considerations and complications and may 
result in blockage of all blood ﬂow to targets distal to this point. 
Distal portions of the posterior cerebral artery (the P4 segment) 
serve the primary visual cortex. Somatosensory, somatomotor, 
and auditory regions of the cerebral cortex are served by terminal 
branches of the middle cerebral artery (M4 in the case of motor and 
sensory, M3/M4 in the case of auditory). Blindness in one eye would 
result from a lesion rostral to the optic chiasm; in the case of a vas-
cular cause, this may relate to damage to the ophthalmic branch of 
the internal carotid. (pp. 19, 27)
28. Answer C: Vestibular schwannomas larger than 2.0 cm in diameter 
may enlarge rostrally, impinge on the sensory root of the trigemi-
nal nerve and, cause loss of sensation on the same side of the face. 
Although the other deﬁcits listed (olfactory loss, visual deﬁcits, tongue 
weakness) are not seen in these patients, diplopia (involvement of 

332
11: Q&As: A Sampling of Study and Review Questions, Many in the USMLE Style, All With Explained Answers
oculomotor, abducens or trochlear nerves, singularly or in combi-
nation) may be present, in fewer than 10%, of patients with ves-
tibular schwannoma. (pp. 22–23, 50, 319)
29. Answer B: The internal acoustic meatus contains the vestibuloco-
chlear nerve, the facial nerve, and the labyrinthine artery, a branch 
of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. A vestibular schwannoma 
located at the meatus may affect the facial nerve and result in facial 
weakness. Large schwannomas usually produce sensory loss on the 
face (30%+ of the time) while facial weakness may be seen in about 
10%+ of cases. The vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves exit the 
skull via the jugular foramen (along with the accessory nerve). The 
cerebellar arteries originate within the skull and distribute to struc-
tures within the skull. (pp. 24, 44–45, 50, 319)
30. Answer C: In this patient the weakness of the right lower extremity 
is related to a lesion of lateral corticospinal tract ﬁbers on the right 
side of the spinal cord. The left corticospinal tract serves the left 
side of the spinal cord and the left lower extremity. Rubrospinal, 
reticulospinal, and vestibulospinal ﬁbers inﬂuence the activity of 
spinal motor neurons; however, the deﬁcits related to corticospinal 
tract damage (signiﬁcant weakness) will dominate over the lack of 
excitation to ﬂexor or extensor motor neurons in the spinal cord 
via these tracts. These latter tracts are dominate in cases of decorti-
cate and decerebrate posturing. (pp. 102–105, 108–109, 210–213)
31. Answer C: The loss of pain and thermal sensations beginning at the 
level of the umbilicus (T10 dermatome) on the left side results from 
damage to ﬁbers of the anterolateral system at about the T8 level on 
the right. These ﬁbers ascend about two spinal levels as they cross 
the midline. Damage at the T6 level would result in a loss begin-
ning at the T8 level on the contralateral side and damage at the 
T10 level would result in a loss beginning at about the T12 level.  
(pp. 102–105, 196–199)
32. Answer C: Weakness of the muscles of the face, particularly when 
upper and lower portions of the face are involved, indicates a lesion 
of either the facial motor nucleus or the exiting ﬁbers of the facial 
nerve; both are located in the lateral pontine tegmentum at cau-
dal levels. The hypoglossal nucleus, which is located in the medial 
medulla, innervates muscles of the tongue. The trigeminal nucleus 
innervates masticatory muscles and is present in the mid to more 
rostral pontine tegmentum. The abducens nucleus is found inter-
nal to the facial colliculus and innervates the lateral rectus muscle. 
These nuclei innervate muscles on the ipsilateral side. The arcuate 
nucleus is a group of cells located on the surface of the pyramid. 
(pp. 118–119, 130–135, 226–233)
33. Answer B: The ﬁbers of the anterolateral system are located in the lat-
eral portion of the pontine tegmentum anterior (ventral) to the facial 
motor nucleus; these ﬁbers convey pain and thermal inputs from the 
contralateral side of the body. The spinal trigeminal tract and the ante-
rior trigeminothalamic tract also convey pain and thermal input but 
from the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the face, respectively. 
The lateral lemniscus is auditory in function and the medial lemniscus 
conveys proprioception, vibratory sense, and discriminative touch also 
from the contralateral body. (pp. 54, 122–131, 138–139, 196–199)
34. Answer D: Damage to the gracile fasciculus on the left (at the T8 
level this is the only part of the posterior columns present at this 
level) accounts for the loss of vibratory sensation (and discrimina-
tive touch). Injury to the gracile fasciculus on the right would result 
in this type of deﬁcit, but on the right side. The level of the cord 
damage is caudal to the cuneate fasciculi and the anterolateral sys-
tem conveys pain and thermal sensations from the contralateral side, 
not proprioceptive information. (pp. 100–105, 108–109, 192–195)
35. Answer A: The loss of pain and thermal sensations on the right 
side of the body correlates with a lesion involving the anterolateral 
system on the left side of the spinal cord. The axons carrying this 
sensory information cross the midline ascending about two spinal 
levels as they do so. A lesion of the right anterolateral system would 
result in a left-sided deﬁcit. The gracile and cuneate fasciculi convey 
discriminative touch, vibratory sensation, and proprioception from 
the ipsilateral side of the body. The posterior spinocerebellar tract 
conveys similar information, but it is not perceived/recognized as 
such (consciously) by the brain. (pp. 104–105, 108–109, 196–199)
36. Answer A: In this case the weakness of the upper and lower extremi-
ties on the right, in association with the diplopia (abducens injury), 
reﬂects damage to corticospinal ﬁbers on the left side of the basilar 
pons. A lesion of these ﬁbers on the right side of the pons would 
produce a left-sided weakness after they cross in the motor decussa-
tion. Rubrospinal ﬁbers are not located in the territory of paramedian 
branches of the basilar artery. Also, lesions of rubrospinal ﬁbers and of 
the middle cerebellar peduncle do not cause weakness but may cause 
other types of motor deﬁcits, particularly in lesions causing decorti-
cate and decerebrate rigidity. (pp. 130–133, 138–139, 220–223)
37. Answer A: The best localizing sign in this case is the diplopia; along 
with the corticospinal deﬁcit and vascular territory, it speciﬁes a 
lesion at the pons–medulla junction on the left. The exiting ﬁbers 
of the abducens nerve (on the left) are in the territory of the para-
median branches of the basilar artery and are laterally adjacent to 
corticospinal ﬁbers in the basilar pons. Diplopia may result from 
lesions of the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, but these structures 
are not in the domain of the paramedian basilar branches. A lesion 
of the optic nerve results in blindness in that eye and damage to the 
facial root does not affect eye movement but may cause a loss of 
view of the external world if the palpebral ﬁssure is closed due to 
facial muscle weakness. (pp. 53–54, 130–133, 138–139)
38. Answer D: At caudal pontine levels most, if not all, of the medial 
lemniscus is located within the territory served by paramedian 
branches of the basilar artery. Penetrating branches of the anterior 
spinal artery serve the hypoglossal nucleus. The other choices are 
generally in the territories of short or long circumferential branches 
of the basilar artery. The hypoglossal nucleus and its root are in the 
territory of the anterior spinal artery. (pp. 54, 124–125, 138–139)
39. Answer D: The vocalis muscle (this muscle is actually the medial 
portion of the thyroarytenoid muscle) is innervated, via the vagus 
nerve, by motor neurons located in the nucleus ambiguus. The 
gracile nucleus conveys proprioception and vibratory sense from 
the body and the spinal trigeminal nucleus relays pain and thermal 
sensory input from the face. The hypoglossal nucleus is motor to 
the tongue and the facial nucleus is motor to the muscles of facial 
expression. (pp. 116–121, 124–125)
40. Answer A: Fibers comprising the anterolateral system convey pain 
and thermal sensations from the body, excluding the face. These ﬁb-
ers are located in lateral portions of the medulla adjacent to the spinal 
trigeminal tract; this latter tract relays pain and thermal sensations 
from the face. Both of these tracts are in the territory of the posterior 
inferior cerebellar artery. The gracile and cuneate fasciculi convey 
proprioception, discriminative touch, and vibratory sense in the

333
spinal cord and the medial lemniscus conveys this same information 
from the medulla to the dorsal thalamus. (pp. 116–121, 124–125)
41. Answer E: The loss of pain and thermal sensations on one side of 
the face correlates with damage to the spinal trigeminal tract; in 
this case the loss is ipsilateral to the lesion. The anterolateral system 
relays pain and thermal sensations from the contralateral side of 
the body, the solitary tract conveys visceral sensory input (general 
visceral sense and taste), and the medial lemniscus contains ﬁbers 
relaying information related to position sense and discriminative 
touch, also from the contralateral side. The medial longitudinal fas-
ciculus does not contain sensory ﬁbers. (pp. 116–121, 124–125)
42. Answer C: The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (commonly called 
PICA by clinicians) serves the posterolateral portion of the medulla, 
which encompasses the anterolateral system, spinal trigeminal 
tract, and nucleus ambiguus plus other nuclei. This combination 
of deﬁcits is variably called the PICA syndrome, lateral medullary 
syndrome, or Wallenberg syndrome. The anterior and medial areas 
of the medulla (containing the pyramid, medial lemniscus, and 
hypoglossal nucleus/nerve) are served by the anterior spinal artery 
and the anterolateral area of the medulla (the region of the olivary 
nuclei) is served by penetrating branches of the vertebral artery. 
The posterior spinal artery serves the posterior column nuclei in 
the medulla and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (commonly 
called AICA) serves caudal portions of the pons and cerebellum. 
(pp. 53–54, 116–121, 124–125)
43. Answer B: The uncus is at the rostral and medial aspect of the para-
hippocampal gyrus, and, in this position, is directly adjacent to the 
anterolateral aspect of the midbrain. The diencephalon is rostral to 
this point and the medulla, the most caudal part of the brainstem, is 
located in the posterior fossa. Late stages of uncal herniation may, 
but not always, result in damage to the rostral pons; this is espe-
cially the case if the patient becomes decerebrate. The cerebellum is 
not involved in uncal herniation but may participate in upward or 
downward cerebellar herniation. (pp. 164–167, 301)
44. Answer D: Herniation of the uncus through the tentorial incisura 
compresses the lateral portions of the brainstem, particularly the 
midbrain, eventually resulting in compression of the corticospi-
nal ﬁbers in the crus cerebri. Weakness on the patient’s left side 
indicates damage to corticospinal ﬁbers in the right crus. In situ-
ations of signiﬁcant shift of the midbrain due to the herniation, 
the contralateral crus also may be damaged, resulting in bilateral 
weakness. Although all other choices contain corticospinal ﬁb-
ers, none of these areas are directly involved in uncal herniation.  
(pp. 152–153, 164–167, 301)
45. Answer C: The root of the oculomotor nerve conveys (general) 
somatic efferent (SE) ﬁbers to four of the six major extraocular mus-
cles and (general) visceral efferent (VE) parasympathetic pregangli-
onic ﬁbers to the ciliary ganglion from which postganglionic ﬁbers 
travel to the sphincter muscle of the iris. Pressure on the oculomotor 
root, as in uncal herniation, will usually compress the smaller diam-
eter, and more superﬁcially located VE ﬁbers ﬁrst (pupil dilation) 
followed by eventual compression of the larger diameter motor ﬁb-
ers (muscle weakness). Optic nerve damage results in blindness in 
that eye, injury to sympathetic ﬁbers to the eye results in constric-
tion of the pupil, and an abducens root injury results in an inability 
to abduct that eye or in diplopia. A lesion of corticonuclear ﬁbers 
in the crus results primarily in motor deﬁcits related to the facial, 
hypoglossal, and accessory nerves. (pp. 152–153, 164–167, 301)
46. Answer C: The absence of, or the aberrant development of, muscle 
around the oral cavity and over the cheek (muscles of facial expres-
sion, innervated by the facial [VII] nerve) indicate a failure of proper 
differentiation of the second pharyngeal arch. Arch 2 also gives rise 
to the stapedius, buccinator, stylohyoid, platysma, and posterior 
belly of the digastric. Mesoderm of the head outside of the pharyn-
geal arches gives rise to the extraocular muscles and muscles of the 
tongue. The muscles of mastication (plus the tensor tympani, ten-
sor veli palati, mylohyoid, anterior belly of the digastric) arise from 
arch 1, the stylopharyngeus from arch 3, and striated muscles of the 
pharynx, larynx, and upper esophagus from arch 4. (pp. 226–233)
47. Answer C: The best localizing sign in this patient is the paucity of 
eye movement and dilated pupil on the left; this indicates a lesion 
of the midbrain on the left at the level of the exiting oculomotor 
ﬁbers. The red nucleus is found at the same level and, more impor-
tantly, immediately lateral to the red nucleus is a compact bundle of 
cerebellothalamic ﬁbers. The ataxia and tremor are related prima-
rily to damage these cerebellar efferent ﬁbers. The motor deﬁcit is 
contralateral to the lesion because the corticospinal ﬁbers, through 
which the deﬁcit is expressed, cross at the motor (pyramidal) decus-
sation. Lesions at the other choices would not result in a paucity 
of eye movement, or result in these deﬁcits on the wrong side, and, 
therefore, are not potential candidates. (pp. 226–229, 248–251)
48. Answer C: The lesion on the exiting oculomotor ﬁbers (on the 
left) damages the preganglionic parasympathetic ﬁbers from the 
Edinger-Westphal preganglionic nucleus. Activation of these ﬁbers 
produces pupil constriction; when their inﬂuence is removed the 
pupil dilates. Consequently, the intact postganglionic sympathetic 
ﬁbers from the ipsilateral superior cervical ganglion predominate, 
and the pupil dilates. Choices on the right are on the incorrect side. 
Damage to hypothalamospinal ﬁbers would remove sympathetic 
inﬂuence at the intermediolateral cell column, and the pupil would 
constrict (parasympathetic domination). (pp. 226–229, 239)
49. Answer B: Cell bodies in the nucleus ambiguus innervate muscles 
of the pharynx and larynx, including what is commonly called the 
vocalis muscle. One result of damage to this nucleus is dysarthria; 
another is dysphagia. The solitary tract and nuclei are concerned 
with visceral afferent information, including taste, and the spinal 
trigeminal tract is made the central processes of primary sensory 
ﬁbers conveying (general) somatic afferent (SA) information from 
the ipsilateral side of the face and oral cavity. Proprioceptive infor-
mation from the ipsilateral upper extremity is transmitted via the 
cuneate nucleus; the vestibular nuclei are related to balance, equi-
librium, and control of eye movement. (pp. 230–233)
50. Answer C: The area of the brainstem that contains the nucleus 
ambiguus is served by branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar 
artery (PICA). Occlusion of this vessel usually gives rise to the PICA 
(lateral medullary or Wallenberg) syndrome. The anterior inferior 
cerebellar artery (AICA) serves the lateral and inferior cerebellar 
surface and the superior cerebellar artery serves the superior surface 
and much of the cerebellar nuclei. The labyrinthine artery, a branch 
of AICA, serves the inner ear. The posterior spinal artery serves the 
posterior columns and their nuclei. (pp. 124–125, 138–139)
51. Answer B: The lesion in this woman is in the medulla, and the sensory 
loss on the body (excluding the head) is on her left side; a lesion in the 
medulla on the right side, involving ﬁbers of the anterolateral system 
(ALS), accounts for this sensory deﬁcit. The overall sensory deﬁcits 
in this case may be called an alternate (or crossed) hemianesthesia. A 

334
11: Q&As: A Sampling of Study and Review Questions, Many in the USMLE Style, All With Explained Answers
lesion of the ALS on the left side of the medulla would result in sen-
sory deﬁcits on the right side of the body. The spinal trigeminal tract 
and nucleus convey pain and thermal sensations from the ipsilateral 
side (right side in this case) of the face, and the medial lemniscus 
conveys vibratory and discriminative touch sensations from the con-
tralateral side of the body. (pp.196–199, 202–205)
52. Answer C: The woman is hoarse because the lesion involves the 
region of the medulla that includes the nucleus ambiguus. These 
motor neurons serve, via the glossopharyngeal (IX) and vagus (X) 
nerves, the muscles of the larynx and pharynx, including the medial 
portion of the thyroarytenoid, also called the vocalis muscle. Paral-
ysis of the vocalis on one side will cause hoarseness of the voice. 
This patient will, most likely, also experience difﬁculty swallow-
ing (dysphagia). Hypoglossal nucleus or nerve, or facial nucleus 
lesions, may cause difﬁculty with speech (altered movements of 
the tongue or muscles around the mouth) but not hoarseness. The 
spinal trigeminal tract conveys sensory input from the ipsilateral 
side of the face. There are no historical or examination ﬁndings to 
support a diagnosis of upper respiratory viral ﬁndings (cold or ﬂu). 
(pp. 54, 226–233)
53. Answer C: The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) serves the 
lateral area of the medulla that contains the anterolateral system, spi-
nal trigeminal tract (loss of pain and thermal sensations from the 
ipsilateral side of the face), the nucleus ambiguus, and other struc-
tures. Many patients that present with a PICA (Wallenberg or lateral 
medullary) syndrome may also have involvement of the vertebral 
artery on that side. The posterior spinal artery serves the posterior 
column nuclei in the medulla, and the anterior spinal artery serves 
the pyramid, medial lemniscus, and exiting roots of the hypoglossal 
nerve. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery and the superior cerebel-
lar artery distribute to the pons and midbrain, respectively, plus sig-
niﬁcant portions of the cerebellum. (pp. 25, 31, 124–125, 196–199)
54. Answer E: Excessive eating (gluttony), which may also include, in the 
case of this patient, a propensity to attempt to eat things not consid-
ered food items, is hyperphagia. Dysphagia is difﬁculty in swallowing 
and frequently related to medullary damage. Aphagia is the inability 
to eat; this may reﬂect dysfunction of the masticatory apparatus or 
the lack of desire to eat. Hyperorality is the tendency to put items in 
the mouth or to appear to be examining objects by placing them in 
the oral cavity. Dyspnea is difﬁculty breathing. (pp. 280–285)
55. Answer A: The constellation of deﬁcits experienced by this man 
is characteristic of the Klüver-Bucy syndrome; this may be seen 
following bilateral damage to the temporal poles particularly that 
which includes the amygdaloid complex. The Korsakoff syndrome 
(psychosis) is seen, for example, in chronic alcoholics, and senile 
dementia is a loss of cognitive and intellectual function associated 
with neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly (e.g., Alzheimer dis-
ease). Wernicke (receptive or ﬂuent) aphasia is seen in patients with 
a lesion in the area of the inferior parietal lobule, and the Wallen-
berg syndrome results from a lesion in the medulla and is character-
ized by alternating (crossed) hemisensory losses and, depending on 
the extent of the damage, other deﬁcits. (pp. 280–285)
56. Answer B: Bilateral damage to the temporal lobes, as in this case, may 
result in damage to the hippocampus by any one of several mecha-
nisms. While remote memory, the ability to recall events that hap-
pened years ago, is intact, the man will have difﬁculty “remembering” 
recent (last few days/weeks) or immediate (last few minutes/hours) 
events. That is, he will ﬁnd it difﬁcult, if not impossible, to turn a new 
experience into longer-term memory (something that can be recalled 
in its proper context at a later time). Dysphagia (difﬁculty swallowing) 
and dysarthria (difﬁculty speaking) are deﬁcits usually seen in brain-
stem lesions. Bilateral sensory losses of the lower portion of the body 
could be seen with bilateral damage to the posterior paracentral gyri 
(falcine meningioma) or to the anterior white commissure of the spinal 
cord. Dementia is a multiregional symptom that usually involves sev-
eral areas of the brain, cortical as well as subcortical. (pp. 280–285)
57. Answer C: The Meyer-Archambault loop (sometimes called the 
Meyer loop) is composed of optic radiation ﬁbers that loop through 
the temporal lobe; these ﬁbers, on each side, convey visual input 
from the contralateral superior quadrant of the visual ﬁeld. Con-
sequently, a bilateral lesion of these ﬁbers results as a bilateral 
superior quadrantanopia. Bilateral inferior quadrantanopia is seen 
in bilateral lesions that would involve the superior portion of the 
optic radiations. Right or left superior quadrantanopia is seen in 
cases of unilateral damage to, respectively, the left or right Meyer-
Archambault loop. A bitemporal hemianopsia results in a lesion of 
the optic chiasm. (pp. 262–267)
58. Answer C: The combination of eye movement disorders and a con-
tralateral hemiplegia localizes this lesion to the midbrain on the side 
of the ocular deﬁcits (right side); the best localizing signs are the third 
nerve deﬁcits. This also speciﬁes that corticospinal ﬁbers on the right 
(in the crus) are damaged, and places the location of the cells of ori-
gin for these ﬁbers in the somatomotor cortex on the right side. The 
right crus contains the axons of these ﬁbers but not the neuronal cell 
bodies. The left somatomotor cortex inﬂuences the right extremities. 
The right precentral gyrus does not contain cells projecting to the left 
lumbosacral spinal cord (left lower extremity), and the right anterior 
paracentral gyrus does not contain the cells that project to the left 
cervical spinal cord (left upper extremity). (pp. 210–217)
59. Answer A: The lesion in this man is in the central (brainstem/mid-
brain) and involves the third nerve and adjacent structures, such 
as the red nucleus and cerebellothalamic ﬁbers. Consequently, the 
damage is to the preganglionic parasympathetic ﬁbers in the root of 
the oculomotor (III) nerve; this removes the parasympathetic inﬂu-
ence (pupil constriction) that originates from the Edinger-Westphal 
preganglionic nucleus. Fibers from the superior cervical ganglion 
are intact, hence the dilated pupil. Fibers from the geniculate gan-
glion and inferior salivatory nucleus distribute on the facial (VII) 
and glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves, respectively. Postganglionic ﬁb-
ers from the ciliary ganglion, although involved in this pathway, are 
not damaged in this lesion. (pp. 146–149, 226–229)
60. Answer E: The loss of most eye movement on one side (oculomotor 
nerve root involvement) coupled with a paralysis of the extremities 
on the contralateral side is a superior alternating (crossed) hemiple-
gia (this is also known as the Weber syndrome): superior because it 
is the most rostral of three; alternating (crossed) because it is a cra-
nial nerve on one side and the extremities on the other; and hemi-
plegia because one-half of the body below the head is involved. 
A middle alternating (crossed) hemiplegia involves the abducens 
(VI) nerve root and adjacent corticospinal ﬁbers (Raymond syn-
drome), and an inferior alternating (crossed) hemiplegia involves 
the hypoglossal (XII) nerve root and corticospinal ﬁbers in the pyr-
amid (Déjèrine syndrome). Alternating hemianesthesia is a sensory 
loss, and a Brown-Séquard syndrome is a spinal cord lesion with no 
cranial nerve deﬁcits. (pp. 226–229)
