ome important societal beliefs transmit across generations 
despite widely available information that directly contradicts 
these beliefs1,2. One such belief is the notion that men are 
inherently better than women at learning mathematics. This belief 
persists in many countries despite women often performing as well 
or better than men in K-12 maths assessments3–6.
These societal beliefs contribute to individual belief formation 
and this linkage can be harmful if it affects children’s beliefs about 
themselves or their effort in school3,7–9. Prior work has shown that 
strong cultural beliefs about gender are correlated with differen-
tial effort, enthusiasm and performance in school by gender7,10. 
To understand and address the under-representation of women 
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) 
fields, it is therefore imperative to better understand what drives 
the transmission and persistence of societal beliefs about gendered 
mathematics ability and the impacts of this transmission on related 
educational outcomes11.
In this paper, we show how beliefs about differential maths 
ability by gender transmit across generations through children’s 
peers and affect girls’ demonstrated maths ability, relative to boys’. 
First, we show that gendered beliefs formed in one generation pass 
on to the next through a child’s peer group. Second, we estimate 
how this influences their actual maths ability, as demonstrated in 
school-by-grade level midterm maths exams. We find that this 
improves boys’ test scores and harms that of girls’, thus amplifying 
the message behind the belief.
We focus on how beliefs transmit from one generation to the 
next because this is an important means through which such beliefs 
persist. Children’s beliefs are more malleable than those of adults’ 
for two reasons: (1) because children have less experience than 
adults from which to judge the reliability of new information; and 
(2) because recent evidence finds that that children process new 
information through a lens of broader exploration about how the 
world works than do adults12–15. This implies that adults’ beliefs 
are probably themselves formed in childhood, at a time of greater 
incidence of societal beliefs that privilege males over females16,17.  
This means that traditional societal beliefs can be passed on through 
generations even when they are contradicted by reality, as they are 
in the context we study.
Studying this transmission is fraught by both practical and ethi-
cal concerns. Although recent work has shown evidence that parents 
may transfer beliefs to their children7,18, it is impossible to random-
ize parental exposure. Furthermore, it is not ethically justifiable to 
randomly expose some children to greater levels of these beliefs for 
the purpose of studying them because of existing evidence linking 
greater levels of these beliefs to greater disadvantage for girls7,19. To 
get around these problems, in this paper we use methods from the 
rich literature on peer effects and exploit the random assignment 
of children to classrooms, to generate quasi-experimental evidence 
of the transmission of societal beliefs about gendered maths ability 
from one generation to the next. We use the fact that the random 
assignment of children to classrooms generates random varia-
tion in the number of a child’s classmates (which we call ‘peers’) 
whose parents believe that boys are inherently better than girls at 
learning mathematics. We use the statistical tools developed in 
quasi-experimental causal inference research, and in the peer effects 
literature specifically, to isolate the effect of exposure to a greater 
number of peers whose parents hold this belief, from the wide range 
of other peer effects.
Our setting has three features that make it well-suited to our 
study. First, the period of life we study is one ripe for belief updat-
ing. In China, the difficulty of the maths curriculum in middle 
school increases substantially from that of primary school20. This 
sudden increase in difficulty is likely to cause students to consider 
revising their beliefs about their own maths ability and those of 
each gender21. Second, the widespread use of random assignment 
of children to classrooms within schools in this context allows us to 
generate quasi-experimental estimates of this transmission, a phe-
nomenon that previously has been estimated primarily using only 
correlational analysis7,18. This random assignment generates ran-
dom variation in various student traits which can be analysed in 
a manner akin to analysis of a randomized control trial, with some

In many societies, beliefs about differential intellectual ability by gender persist across generations. These societal beliefs can 
contribute to individual belief formation and thus lead to persistent gender inequality across multiple dimensions. We show 
evidence of intergenerational transmission of gender norms through peers and how this affects gender gaps in learning. We 
use nationally representative data from China and the random assignment of children to middle-school classrooms to estimate 
the effect of being assigned a peer group with a high proportion of parents who believe that boys are innately better than girls 
at learning mathematics. We find this increases a child’s likelihood of holding the belief, with greater effects from peers of the 
same gender. It also affects the child’s demonstrated mathematics ability, generating gains for boys and losses for girls. Our 
findings highlight how the informational environment in which children grow up can shape their beliefs and academic ability.

modifications22,23. This strategy has been used to study the impacts 
of being assigned to peer groups with various traits, such as groups 
of peers with higher academic aptitude23, a greater proportion of 
female peers24 and groups of peers whose parents have higher lev-
els of education25. Third, the belief we study—that boys’ natural 
ability in mathematics is greater than that of girls—is commonly 
held among middle-school children and parents in China, despite 
the fact that girls outperform boys in the maths assessment data  
we observe.
Our data are from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), 
a nationally representative survey of Chinese middle-school stu-
dents from 112 schools. The survey team surveyed all students in 
two randomly selected seventh-grade classes and two randomly 
selected ninth-grade classes in each school. We use CEPS data from 
students, their teachers and their parents. These include adminis-
trative records of the child’s academic performance in mathematics 
as well as each child’s responses to a survey about their beliefs. The 
parent data include demographic data and similar responses to a 
survey on parent beliefs. We present summary statistics of our sam-
ple by child gender in Supplementary Table 1 and by parent beliefs 
in Supplementary Table 2. We report tests of the randomization of 
children to classrooms in Supplementary Table 3, which fail to reject 
the null that children were randomly assigned to classrooms within 
a school.
The CEPS asks a parent of each child whether or not they agree 
with the statement ‘boys’ natural ability in studying mathematics 
is greater than that of girls’. For shorthand we will refer to this as 
believing that Bm > Gm, where Bm represents boys’ innate maths abil-
ity and Gm represents that of girls. We use this question to generate a 
child-level leave-one-out measure that captures, for each child, the 
proportion of randomly assigned peers in their classroom whose 
parents report believing that Bm > Gm. In our data, ~41% of parents 
agree with the statement, while the remaining 59% disagree; we do 
not observe whether this group sees boys’ and girls’ ability as equal, 
they think girls’ ability is superior or do not know. Our measure of 
the proportion of a child’s peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm 
ranges from zero to 83.3%, with a standard deviation of 11.2%. 
From here onward, we refer to this variable as our ‘measure of peer 
parent beliefs’. Our use of this question builds upon theory and evi-
dence from other work showing that this particular societal belief 
may influence individual children’s beliefs, habit formation, career 
choice and decisions of effort and enthusiasm that often reinforce 
the message sent by the belief8,19,26–28.
We also construct two additional, related measures: one mea-
sure for the beliefs of girl peers’ parents and a separate measure for 
those of boy peers. We use this to test a prediction motivated by the 
notion of ‘homophily’, the tendency for individuals to associate with 
like others29–31. Homophily predicts that we should observe larger 
effects for exposure to own-gendered peers whose parents believe 
that Bm > Gm than for other-gendered peers. This means that varia-
tion in the beliefs of boy peers should have a greater effect on a boy 
than on a girl and vice versa.
Given the random assignment of children to classes, we can use 
ordinary least squares regression analysis to recover how being 
exposed to more peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm affects a 
given child’s beliefs and performance in mathematics22. Our empiri-
cal approach can be represented using the following equation:
Yicgs = β0 + β1Picgs + β2PicgsFicgs + β3Oicgs + β4OicgsFicgs
+β5Cicgs + ηgs + ϵicgs
In this equation, Yicgs refers to the outcome of interest for child i 
in class c in grade g in school s. Picgs is the proportion of child i’s peers 
in their classroom whose parents believe that Bm > Gm, standardized 
to be mean 0, s.d. 1. As mentioned earlier, we use three different  
proportions: the proportion for all peers’ parents, for those of boy 
peers only and for those of girl peers only. Ficgs is an indicator for the 
child being female. Oicgs is an indicator for whether the child’s own 
parent believes that Bm > Gm, following other recent work study-
ing peer parent traits which include the own child’s parent’s trait10. 
Cicgs is a vector of controls. This includes characteristics specific to 
the child: rural versus urban household residency (hukou) status, 
mother’s years of education, father’s years of education, household 
income (a 0/1 variable for being classified as ‘poor’ by the school), 
proxies for the child’s academic ability before entering school ((1) 
results from a cognitive skills test taken outside of school at the 
beginning of the study; and (2) the child’s maths performance in 
the final grade of primary school, before entering middle school), 
the child’s ethnicity, their number of siblings and all these inter-
acted with the child’s gender. It also contains teacher characteristics: 
specifically, teacher gender; teacher gender interacted with child 
gender; years of teaching experience; type of degree; and receipt of 
various teaching awards. We also control for teacher beliefs. While 
we do not have data on teachers’ beliefs about the innate ability of 
boys relative to girls, as we have for children and parents, we do 
observe a separate and useful variable. Specifically, we observe 
teachers’ response to the question: ‘what is the relationship between 
a student’s innate ability and their grades?’ There are three response 
options: ‘basically no relationship’, ‘some relationship’ and ‘a very 
close relationship’. We create an indicator variable equal to one if the 
maths teacher answers ‘a very close relationship’ and zero otherwise 
and add this as an additional control. ηgs is a grade-by-school fixed 
effect (we observe two classrooms per grade per school; on average 
there are seven classrooms in a given grade in a given school) and 
ϵicgs is a standard error, clustered at the grade-by-school level.
Our main coefficients of interest are β1 and β2. The coefficient 
β1 captures the impact of a 1 s.d. (11.2 percentage point) increase 
in the proportion of peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm on 
boys’ outcomes. The coefficient β2 captures the impact of a 1 s.d. 
increase in this measure of peer parent beliefs on girls’ outcomes, 
relative to boys; equivalently, this is the impact of peer parent beliefs 
on the ‘gender gap’ in the outcome being studied. The overall effect 
of exposure to peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm on girls’ 
outcomes is captured by β1 + β2. We estimate β1 and β2 for the over-
all measure of peer parent beliefs, as well as for the measure of boy 
peers’ parents’ beliefs and girl peers’ parents’ beliefs, respectively.
We estimate this equation for two main outcome variables. The 
first is a child’s likelihood of believing that Bm > Gm based on a sur-
vey question similar to the one administrated to parents, referring 
to beliefs about the innate maths ability of each gender, not just the 
relative performance of boys and girls in the child’s current school 
or class. The second is a child’s midterm maths test score, which is 
taken from administrative data recording the child’s performance 
on the maths exams given by all schools in the middle of the autumn 
semester as part of the regular assessment schedule in core subjects 
required of all middle schools. All students within a grade, within a 
school, take the same midterm test in each core subject (mathemat-
ics, Chinese, English), which is graded centrally at the school level 
on an absolute scale. These scores go into students’ permanent aca-
demic records and capture the student’s demonstrated maths ability 
as it is observed by their school and teachers.
We prefer these administrative test score data to data from a 
higher-stakes exam, such as the college entrance exam, for two rea-
sons: (1) because there is substantial evidence to suggest that in more 
competitive or evaluative situations socially stigmatized groups 
may perform worse than their true ability9,32; and (2) that girls spe-
cifically may underperform relative to boys because boys have less 
aversion to competitive situations33–35. In the current study, we are 
interested in measuring children’s acquisition of skill in mathemat-
ics during the normal course of their education, not their perfor-
mance in highly competitive situations per se. While our estimates

look at differential response to exposure after controlling for gender, 
differential gender response to competitive situations31,33 could also 
interact with the exposure we study, generating even greater effects 
in more competitive situations. We test for this in the Methods.
Results
We first show how being assigned to a greater number of classmates 
whose parents believe that Bm > Gm affects whether or not a child 
holds the belief. We show these results in Table 1. Different columns 
pertain to different measures of peer parent beliefs as labelled in the 
column headings.
In the first column of Table 1, we estimate that a 1 s.d. increase 
in the peer parent belief measure is associated with a 4.5 percentage 
point increase in the likelihood that a child will believe that Bm > Gm 
themselves (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.022 to 0.068; P < 0.001). 
The estimated relationship between own parent beliefs and child 
beliefs is also highly significant and has the same sign (positive) as 
the causal estimate of being exposed to more peers whose parents 
hold this belief.
In columns 2 and 3 of Table 1, we show how these patterns vary 
with exposure to peers of different genders. These results show that 
own-gendered peers have a greater impact on a child’s likelihood of 
holding the belief than do other-gendered peers. In column 2, we 
see that the effect of exposure to boy peers whose parents believe 
that Bm > Gm on boys is similar but the sign is negative for the point 
estimate for girls (peer parent beliefs × female). In column 3, we see 
two patterns: (1) the estimate for boys (peer parent beliefs) dimin-
ishes in magnitude by more than half; and (2) the interaction of 
peer parent beliefs × female is positive and on the margin of signifi-
cance (CI −0.001 to 0.051; P = 0.057). The overall effect for girls, 
the sum of the coefficients on the peer parent beliefs (PPB) and 
PPB × female variables (β1 + β1), is 0.043 and highly statistically sig-
nificant (F1,123 = 9.36, P = 0.003).
Overall, these patterns are consistent with a stronger relation-
ship from own-gendered peers than from other-gendered peers, 
consistent with the predictions of homophily31. We show these three 
relationships graphically in Fig. 1, plotting a kernel-weighted local 
polynomial regression of child beliefs on the peer parent beliefs mea-
sure. The left column shows results for girls and the right column for 
boys. There are three rows in the figure: row 1 shows results for expo-
sure to all peers (similar to column 1 in Table 1) and rows 2 and 3 
show results for exposure to own-gendered peers and other-gendered 
peers, respectively. We see a positive gradient across all plots. The 
plots show visibly steeper gradients from exposure to own-gendered 
peers (second row) than from exposure to other-gendered peers 
(third row). This mirrors the patterns we see in our regression results.
Next, we show how this exposure affects children’s demonstrated 
maths ability. In Table 2, we present regression results with chil-
dren’s midterm maths test scores as the dependent variable. The 
presentation of results mirrors that of Table 1: column 1 in Table 
2 shows results for exposure to all peers whose parents believe that 
Bm > Gm; columns 2 and 3 show results for exposure to boy and girl 
peers whose parents hold the belief, respectively.
We estimate that a 1 s.d. increase in exposure to all peers whose 
parents hold the belief is associated with a non-significant decline 
in girls’ demonstrated maths ability (as measured by the midterm 
test score) relative to boys’, by 0.044 s.d. (95% CI −0.092 to 0.004; 
P = 0.071). The signs on our estimates are consistent with the idea 
that exposure to these peers raises boys’ scores and lowers those of 
girls, further reinforcing the message behind the belief but these 
estimates are only marginally significant and therefore not informa-
tive for the hypotheses. The estimates in column 2 and 3 show even 
more clearly that exposure to own-gendered peers has a much larger 
effect on children’s outcomes than exposure to other-gendered 
peers. A 1 s.d. increase in exposure to boy peers whose parents hold 
this belief is associated with a marginally significant increase in

This table shows results for estimating the effects of exposure to peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm on the child’s likelihood of holding the belief. We estimate this for three types of peer, as indicated 
in the column headings. The dependent variable is coded 0 for ‘no’ and 1 for ‘yes’. For each estimate we present, we provide the coefficient estimate first, with the 95% CI underneath it in parentheses and 
the relevant P value underneath the CI.

boys’ test scores by 0.064 s.d. (column 2; 95% CI −0.003 to 0.131; 
P = 0.063). Finally, we estimate that a 1 s.d. increase in exposure 
to girl peers whose parents hold this belief has a roughly symmet-
ric, negative effect on girls: the sum of the coefficients on the PPB 
and PPB × female variables (β1 + β2) is −0.074 and this estimate is 
statistically significant (F1,123 = 6.04, P = 0.015). The estimates for 
exposure to other-gendered peers are substantially smaller for both 
genders. Again, the sign of the own parent beliefs estimates mirror 
those of the peer parent beliefs measures, giving further assurance 
that we are measuring similar phenomena.
In Fig. 2, we show kernel-weighted local polynomial regressions, 
similar to those in Fig. 1 but regressing child test scores on exposure 
to peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm. The gradients in these 
plots reflect the regression results. For girls (in the left column) we 
see a negative relationship between exposure and test scores; for 
boys we see a positive relationship. We again see steeper gradients 
in the own-gendered plots (second row) than in the other-gendered 
plots (third row), further evidence in support of the predictions 
of homophily, that own-gendered peers are more influential than 
other-gendered peers in the transmission of these beliefs and their 
effects on demonstrated maths ability.
Our final analysis in this section addresses an important alterna-
tive explanation for these results: the estimates we present for our 
key independent variable, peer parent beliefs, are primarily driven 
by the broader, latent peer effects studied in other work22,36 and not 
the effect of exposure to peers whose parents hold these specific 
beliefs per se.
To investigate this possibility, we estimate whether there is suf-
ficient variation in the peer parent beliefs measure, independent 
of these other, well-known sources of peer effects, to generate the 
results we measure. The other sources of peer effects we study 
include traits of peers’ parents, including education, income and 
family background10,25; the gender composition of the child’s class-
room24; and peers’ cognitive ability22,36.

Fig. 1 | Mapping of exposure to peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm onto child beliefs. This shows a kernel-weighted local polynomial regression 
and its 95% CI of a child’s likelihood of reporting that boys are better than girls at learning mathematics (0, no; 1, yes) on the proportion of peers whose 
parents hold that belief (the x axis variable), after removing grade-by-school fixed effects from the dependent (y axis) variable. The x axis variable is 
shown in s.d. terms; a 1 s.d. change means that 11.2% more of peer parents hold the belief; at 0 s.d., 41% of parents hold the belief. The six plots are divided 
by child gender (girls in the left column, boys in the right) and the gender of the peers used to create the peer parent beliefs measure (all peers in the first 
row, own-gendered peers in the second and other-gendered peers in the third. A one unit increase in the peer parent beliefs measure (the x axis variable) 
is equivalent to an 11 percentage point increase in the proportion of own- or other-gendered peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm. We trim the sample 
to include only children whose value for peer parent beliefs falls in the range [−2,2]; this drops 317 observations from the original sample of 8,057 used to 
generate the corresponding results in Table 1.

We operationalize these tests with a series of ‘horse race regres-
sions’ in which we add these controls one at a time and study how 
the magnitude and precision of our estimates of β1 and β2 vary. If 
the magnitude and precision of these estimates persist after adding 
controls for other known contributors of peer effects, this would 
indicate that variation in PPB, independent of these other known 
peer effect sources, is driving the results presented in Tables 1 and 2 
and Figs. 1 and 2 (refs. 37,38).
We present these results in Table 3 where outcomes A and B fol-
low the results in column 1 of Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Outcome 
A shows that our estimates of the effects of exposure to more peers 
whose parents believe that Bm > Gm on a child’s beliefs vary little with 
the inclusion of additional controls for various peer parent traits, 
the gender composition of the classroom and the average cognitive 
ability of peers. Outcome B shows similar results for the stability of 
our estimates for maths test scores. Together, these show that our 
main estimates in Tables 1 and 2 and Figs. 1 and 2 are driven by vari-
ation in PPB, independent of other common sources of peer effects.
Robustness of results. In this section, we address the potential for 
parent beliefs to be affected by the characteristics of the classroom 
their child was assigned to. A weakness of our data is that the parent 
survey was administered after the child was randomly assigned to 
a classroom. This means that, potentially, our estimates of β1 and β2 
could suffer from reverse causality or omitted variables bias. We first 
discuss existing empirical and theoretical work on the formation of 
beliefs among children and adults, which suggests that children’s 
beliefs are far more malleable than those of adults. We then directly 
test for three possible alternative explanations for our results that 
involve parents changing their beliefs. The first possibility is reverse 
causality: that randomly occurring differences between the maths 
ability of boys and girls in a given classroom affects parent beliefs. 
The second is a flavour of the ‘reflection problem’ in which par-
ents’ beliefs could be affected by the beliefs of other parents in their 
child’s randomly assigned classroom. The third is that the gender of 
the maths teacher the child is randomly assigned to may also affect 
parent beliefs about the relative maths ability of boys and girls. We 
find no empirical evidence for any of these channels in our data.
Several pieces of recent research studying the formation of beliefs 
during the life course find that parent beliefs are more stable or less 
likely to change in response to new information than those of chil-
dren12–15. This is due to two factors. First, parents have decades more 
of life experience than children do, during which they have gathered 
information to form their beliefs. Seen through the lens of Bayesian 
updating, this suggests that, in response to new information, any 
update to beliefs from a given packet of information is likely to be 
much smaller for parents, whose priors are ‘firmer’, than for children, 
whose priors are more diffuse13,14. Second, laboratory studies of how 
children and adults process information show that children take an 
approach that is more exploratory, with the goal of learning how the 
world works, as compared with adults, who take an approach that is 
more context-specific12,15. Together, this suggests that adults’ beliefs 
are far less likely to update than children’s. Furthermore, parents in 
our context also spend very little time with the peers of the child, 
particularly as compared to the child, who spends most waking 
hours in school with their classmates. This means that the child is 
also getting, in absolute terms, more ‘information’ from their ran-
dom assignment to a classroom than the parent is; seen through the 
same lens of Bayesian updating, this too predicts that parents are 
less likely to change their beliefs in response to the composition of 
the child’s classroom than is the child.
We can also test these hypotheses empirically. Using our main 
estimating equation, we implement two empirical tests to evalu-
ate the extent to which parents’ beliefs may respond to the relative 
maths ability of the other children in their child’s randomly assigned 
classroom. In both tests, the dependent variable is an indicator vari-
able for whether the parent believes that Bm > Gm. In the first test, 
our main explanatory variable is the difference between the maths

In all regressions, the dependent variable is the child’s test score on a midterm maths test centrally administered by the child’s school. The maths test score variable is continuous and standardized to be 
mean 0, s.d. 1. The observations in this sample reflect all children for whom we have a maths test score. Different columns pertain to different measures of peer parent beliefs as labelled in the column 
headings. For each estimate we present, we provide the coefficient estimate first, with the 95% CI underneath it in parentheses and the relevant P value underneath the CI.

test scores of the child’s peer boys and peer girls. This test estimates 
how an increase in the maths performance of boys (relative to girls) 
among the children in a child’s classroom affects the beliefs of the 
child’s own parent. In the second test, we create an indicator variable 
equal to one if the highest performing child in the class is male. This 
tests for the informational salience that comes with the recognition 
that top performers are often given and the potential for this to have 
asymmetric effects by gender.
In Supplementary Table 4A, we present our results for the effect 
of an increase in boys’ performance, relative to girls, on a parent’s 
beliefs. We find no evidence that a parent is more likely to believe 
that Bm > Gm when their child is assigned to a classroom where boys 
outperform girls in mathematics. Our estimated coefficients are 
small and not distinguishable from zero but also precise: the CIs 
we generate can reject that a 1 s.d. increase in peer boys’ perfor-
mance, relative to peer girls, generates anything larger than a 0.8 
percentage point change in the likelihood that a parent believes that 
boys are better than girls at learning mathematics, from a baseline 
of 41% (coefficient = 0.0041; 95% CI −0.0013 to 0.0094; P = 0.13). 
In columns 2 and 3 of Supplementary Table 4, we estimate these 
effects separately for parents of seventh graders and ninth graders. 
Recall that the seventh-grade children of these parents have been 
with their peers for 3–6 months when the parent is interviewed and 
the ninth-grade children have been with their same peer group for 
2 years and 3–6 months. This analysis tests for the possibility that, 
as the amount of time parents are exposed to their child’s peers 
increases, so will the likelihood that they update their beliefs. Our 
coefficient estimates provide no evidence of this phenomenon 
either. In Supplementary Table 4B, we present analogue results 
using an indicator variable for the top-scoring student on the mid-
term maths test being male as the main explanatory variable. We see 
no evidence of parents’ beliefs changing in response to the gender 
of the top performer. Our results suggest that neither (1) a large 
change in the performance of boys in mathematics, relative to girls,

Fig. 2 | Mapping of exposure to peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm onto test scores. This is an analogue to Fig. 1; it shows a kernel-weighted local 
polynomial regression and its 95% CI of a child’s (standardized) maths test score on the proportion of peers whose parents hold that belief (the x axis 
variable), after removing grade-by-school fixed effects from the dependent (y axis) variable. The x axis variable is shown in s.d. terms; a 1 s.d. change 
means that 11.2% more of peer parents hold the belief; at 0 s.d., 41% of parents hold the belief. The six plots are divided by child gender (boys in the left 
column, girls in the right) and the gender of the peers used to create the peer parent beliefs measure (all peers in the first row, own-gendered peers in the 
second and other-gendered peers in the third. A one unit increase in the peer parent beliefs measure (the x axis variable) is equivalent to an 11 percentage 
point increase in the proportion of own- or other-gendered peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm.We trim the sample to include only children whose 
value for peer parent beliefs falls in the range [−2,2]; this drops 309 observations from the original sample of 8,028 used to generate the corresponding 
results in Table 2.

among a child’s peers, nor (2) a change in the gender of the top per-
former in mathematics, is likely to generate more than a very small 
change in parent beliefs. Analogue results using the proportion of 
the top three students in the class who are male, not shown here for 
brevity but available on request, yield similar patterns.
Next, we test whether parent beliefs adjust in response to expo-
sure to other parent beliefs; this is a specific flavour of the ‘reflection 
problem’36,39. To test for this, we regress PPB on own parent beliefs 
using our core specification. Note that regressing an individual’s 
given characteristic (own parent’s beliefs) on the leave-one-out aver-
age of this same characteristic (PPB) in an individual’s randomly 
assigned cluster yields a mechanical negative correlation. The intu-
ition behind this is as follows: given the random assignment of stu-
dents into classes, the law of large numbers predicts that, in a given 
class, the proportion of students with a certain characteristic (for 
example, average parent beliefs or per cent female) will be distrib-
uted normally. A student’s characteristic is thus negatively correlated 
with the leave-one-out average because the overall proportion is 
equivalent to the sum of the student’s characteristic and this average.
To formalize this intuition, we conduct a permutation test, ran-
domly assigning to each child 1,000 ‘placebo own parent belief’ ran-
dom variables with the same potential values (0/1) and expected 
value (0.410) as the true parent belief variable. We then generate 
1,000 new ‘placebo PPB’ measures, using the 1,000 placebo belief 
draws for the parents of each student’s peers in their classroom. 
We standardize these and then run one regression for each of the 
1,000 draws, regressing the random variable of each student’s own 
parent’s placebo beliefs on the placebo PPB measure, its interac-
tion with the female indicator variable and the other controls as 
given in our estimating equation. This generates ˜γ, the mean of our 
permutation test estimates. We find ˜γ = −0.127 (95% CI −0.066 to 
−0.188; P < 0.001). Using the true data, we estimate ˆγ, the effect of a 
1 s.d. increase in the proportion of peers whose parents believe that 
Bm > Gm on a child’s own parent’s likelihood of holding the belief, to 
be ˆγ = −0.079. Because our estimate of ˆγ falls well within the 95% CI 
around ˜γ generated by the permutation test, we conclude that there 
is no evidence for this reflection problem.
We also test whether the gender of the child’s randomly assigned 
maths teacher affects a parent’s likelihood of believing that Bm > Gm. 
Here again we can simply regress the parent’s response to the 
belief question on the gender of the maths teacher, controlling for 
grade-by-school fixed effects. We find no evidence of this potential 
channel either. The estimated coefficient of the impact on the likeli-
hood that a parent believes that Bm > Gm of their child being assigned

The dependent variable is given in the titles for outcomes A and B. The X at the bottom of the table indicate that the results shown in the column above are generated with the indicated controls added to 
our estimating equation. For peer parents’ education, we add variables capturing the average number of years that the child’s classmates’ mothers and fathers spent in school, respectively. For income, we 
add the proportion of peers who fall in the ‘low income’ category according to the school. For family background status, we use the proportion of peers with a rural residence permit or hukou. The proportion 
of girl peers in the child’s classroom is self-explanatory. The cognitive ability measure is from a proprietary test using items similar to those in a Raven’s Matrices test, standardized to be mean 0, s.d. 1. For 
each estimate we present, we provide the coefficient estimate first, with the 95% CI underneath it in parentheses and the relevant P value underneath the CI.

a female maths teacher is positive, small and statistically insignifi-
cant (treatment effect, using our estimating equation: β1 = 0.0257; 
95% CI −0.140 to 0.654; P = 0.202). We also find no evidence of 
differential effects for parents of seventh- and ninth-grade students.
We next study whether there is variation in PPB independent 
of the variation in peer beliefs. If peer beliefs entirely captured 
the effects we measure and attribute to peer parents’ beliefs, then 
adding them would diminish the magnitude and significance of 
the peer parent variable. On the other hand, if the effect of PPB 
were not entirely captured by the inclusion of peer beliefs, then we 
would have greater reason to believe that the patterns we observe 
are driven by this intergenerational transmission of beliefs from 
parents to a child and on to the child’s peers, rather than merely 
by idiosyncratic variation in child characteristics. In Supplementary 
Tables 5 and 6, we show analogues to Tables 1 and 2, respectively. 
These tables include a measure of peer beliefs (and their interaction 
with child gender), constructed as a leave-one-out measure of the 
child beliefs in a classroom, excluding the child, as we do for PPB. 
We see in both tables that the sign, magnitude and significance of 
our estimates are largely consistent with prior results, in some cases 
even larger. While peer beliefs do also clearly matter, this analysis, 
like that of Table 3, shows that there is variation in PPB independent 
of peer beliefs that leads to the effects we measure.
Finally, we comment on the extent to which parents may update 
their beliefs in response to their own child’s gender and ability. We 
cannot empirically evaluate the extent to which a child’s own abil-
ity affects their parents’ beliefs about the relative ability of boys 
and girls in mathematics. This is because we lack panel data on the 
child’s ability and their parents’ beliefs from earlier in the child’s life. 
We assume, however, that the primary interaction between parents 
and their child is parents’ beliefs and actions shaping those of their 
children and not child ability shaping parent beliefs. This assump-
tion is based on three arguments: (1) the vast child development 
literature documenting the great extent to which parents influence 
their children’s development21,40,41; (2) the prior work and evidence 
presented earlier in this paper indicating that parents’ beliefs are 
relatively harder to manipulate than children’s12–15; and (3) the fact 
that even if child ability were to affect parent beliefs, we show in 
Table 3 that controlling for peer cognitive ability does not substan-
tially change our belief transmission results or the estimated effects 
on test scores.
We can also measure how parent beliefs about gender differences 
in maths ability vary with the gender of their child(ren). The revela-
tion of child gender is a large information shock associated with a 
change in parent beliefs at the time of revelation42–44. This has also 
been shown to be the case in China, where son preference often pre-
vails45. We report analyses of this in our data. More than half of the 
families in our sample have multiple children. On average, among 
parents who have only girls, 38.0% believe that Bm > Gm; among par-
ents who have both a girl and a boy, 40.8% hold the belief; among 
parents with only boys, 43.7% do.
The correlation between child gender and parent beliefs is small 
compared to the idiosyncratic variation in parent beliefs across class-
rooms, within a grade, within a school; we show in Supplementary 
Fig. 2 that the percentage of children whose parents hold this belief 
regularly varies by >15 percentage points. Furthermore, several 
previous studies show that after responding to the revelation of the 
child’s gender, parent beliefs are unlikely to further change42–44. As 
a whole, we interpret the patterns we see in our data and existing 
evidence on parent response to child gender as further supporting 
our claim that beliefs about gender differences in maths ability are 
much more likely to shift in childhood than in adulthood.
Discussion
Our study’s core contribution is to advance understanding of an 
important channel through which beliefs about gender differences 
in maths ability transmit across generations and how this affects chil-
dren’s beliefs about themselves and their academic performance. We 
overcome the logistical and ethical barriers to estimating this rela-
tionship experimentally by applying a quasi-experimental research 
design to a setting with substantial, randomly assigned variation 
in the proportion of a child’s peers whose parents hold this belief. 
We show positive evidence of the intergenerational transmission of 
these beliefs via peers, an important channel of belief transmission 
and how this leads to self-reinforcing outcomes that confirm the 
once-erroneous message of the belief and which may contribute to 
under-representation of women in STEM fields8.
Two aspects of this study make it likely to underestimate the full 
impacts of this exposure. First, we study only one round of out-
comes. As a result, we are unable to track the longer-term academic 
and career effects of exposure to these beliefs, which are likely to be 
larger if these effects compound over time. We also work in a set-
ting in which girls outperform boys in mathematics. Even in such 
a setting, we find harms of exposure to peers whose parents hold 
this belief.
There are a few key limitations of our approach. The first limi-
tation is that the process we study—the intergenerational trans-
mission of beliefs—is a ‘black box’. Prior work has established that 
parent-to-child transmission of this belief occurs7,17,18. Our anal-
ysis establishes that transmission of this belief also occurs via a 
separate channel: children who learn the belief from their parents 
transmit it to their peers. In the Methods, we present results show-
ing that for the effects we study, the most likely channel is from 
peer parent to the peer child and then peer child to child, rather 
than from peer parent directly to the child. Our research design, 
however, does not allow us to analyse how the beliefs are trans-
ferred from parent to child. Many likely channels exist, includ-
ing direct discussion of the issue, the messages imparted by the 
gifts and encouragement parents give to children and even simple 
observation of the parents’ conduct, tone of voice and values. The 
second limitation is that this is not a randomized controlled trial; 
instead, we use quasi-experimental variation in the proportion of 
peers whose parents hold this belief. It is therefore possible that 
there is some external, omitted factor that drives both PPB and 
child outcomes. While we are unable to rule out the existence of 
any such factor, we are able to show that the results we generate 
are independent of variation in observable factors related to all of 
the main contributors (parent education, income, peer aptitude 
and others) that have been identified in 20 years of prior work on 
peer effects. This gives us confidence that such an omitted factor 
is unlikely to play a meaningful role in driving the results we attri-
bute to the intergenerational transmission of this specific belief 
via peers. The third limitation is that we rely on a single measure 
of parent beliefs, which is ultimately a proxy for parents’ broader 
beliefs about gender and how they teach their child about it. Our 
main claims are: (1) that we provide evidence of the impact of 
this latent effect, using parent beliefs, a measure that we show can 
capture the impacts of this effect; and (2) we demonstrate that a 
large component of this effect is orthogonal to the other sources 
of peer effects, both broad and specific, that have been studied in 
the prior literature. Finally, while we have shown evidence that 
these effects exist, their magnitude will probably vary with the 
amount of exposure children have to their peers, which differs 
across contexts.
Our work highlights the importance of the informational envi-
ronment that children grow up in and the role it plays in propagat-
ing societal beliefs across generations. Childhood exposure to such 
societal beliefs can come from myriad sources; our study shows that 
this exposure can perpetuate these beliefs and, in so doing, contrib-
ute to gender inequality. Future work should aim to address and 
reverse the harms that the transmission of these widely held beliefs 
about differential ability can cause.

Methods
Quasi-experimental analysis of the transmission of beliefs. We are interested 
in studying how an influential type of societal belief—that boys are inherently 
better than girls in certain dimensions—transmits across individuals and across 
generations. Because greater levels of this belief at the societal level have been 
shown to be correlated with lower relative educational performance7,19, it is 
unethical to study the effects of greater exposure to this belief with a randomized 
controlled trial. Given this limitation, our approach is to study this transmission 
using a quasi-experimental approach46,47. Specifically, we exploit the random 
assignment of students to classmates in (Chinese) middle schools, a frequently 
used method in the study of peer effects22,23, which generates random variation in 
the proportion of peers in a child’s classroom with parents who hold this belief.
Our research design follows that of other quasi-experimental analyses which 
study the impact of being assigned to a peer group with different peer or peer 
parental characteristics, exploiting random classroom assignment22,23,48. While 
this approach does not experimentally vary only one characteristic while holding 
others constant, it is able to study the randomly assigned variation from a given 
characteristic that is independent of variation in other observable characteristics. 
These methods have been used to study the impact of being assigned to peers with 
different levels of gender composition24,49, higher levels of academic ability23,48 and 
more educated parents25,50, among others.
When using such designs, researchers must establish that there is no omitted 
variable driving both the belief and the outcome. We present this analysis in Table 
3, which shows that, for the most important previously identified sources of peer 
effects studied in this literature (peer gender, peer aptitude, parent education and 
parent income) there is variation in our main explanatory variable independent 
of each of these sources of peer effect. As described earlier in the paper, while this 
analysis does not rule out any such possible source, it does rule out all of the likely 
sources identified in previous work on peer effects.
Background information on our context and data. We use the first wave of the 
CEPS for our empirical analysis. The CEPS is a nationally representative sample 
of Chinese middle-school students, collecting a series of data from the students, 
their parents, their teachers and their principals, planned to continue over several 
waves. The CEPS follows all students in two randomly selected seventh-grade 
classes and two randomly selected ninth-grade classes in each of 112 randomly 
selected schools. Chinese middle schools typically span three grades: seven, eight 
and nine. The median school in our dataset has six seventh-grade classrooms 
and six ninth-grade classrooms (mean: 7.3 and 6.9, respectively). Schools in this 
dataset were selected using a nationally representative random sampling frame 
with selection probability proportional to size. Geographically, the sampling 
frame includes all counties and city districts of the 31 provinces, municipalities 
and autonomous regions of China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 
All further geographic information about observations is suppressed for users of 
these data to protect the anonymity of participants. The dataset comprises ~20,000 
students and the first wave was collected in the 2013–2014 academic year. The 
second, latest available wave collects data only for a subset of children. We do not 
use it here because of its smaller sample size and because it does not contain key 
data such as parent or child beliefs.
The CEPS student data include administrative data on the child’s academic 
performance in mathematics, Chinese and English, as well as the child’s responses 
to a survey about their beliefs and aspirations. The parent data include a variety 
of demographic data as well as survey responses to a series of questions about the 
parent’s beliefs. The teacher and administrator data include information on teacher 
characteristics and the method used to assign children to classes.
According to a law passed in 2006, Chinese middle schools are normally 
required to randomly assign children to classrooms. Under this system, children 
are assigned to a classroom at the start of seventh grade and remain with the same 
peers in this randomly assigned classroom throughout middle school. In practice, 
some schools may deviate from this rule, for example, to sort children on ability. 
We follow the same sample restriction used in prior work using CEPS data: we 
analyse data from only those within-grade classroom pairs where principals 
and teachers report that random assignment was used to place children in 
classrooms6,24,51. This generates a sample of 8,057 children in 215 classrooms spread 
across 86 schools and this is the estimation sample we use throughout our analysis 
in this paper. The excluded grade-by-school classroom pairs report either using 
methods other than random assignment to place children in classes or re-sorting 
children to classrooms in the years after the initial random assignment. This latter 
group comprises predominantly ninth-grade classrooms, where re-sorting often 
occurs due to administrative concerns about placing children in good high schools. 
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes 
are larger than those reported in other recent studies of peer effects10,25,50.
Across China, various methods are used for assignment of children to classes, 
including random number generators, alphabetical assignment based on surname 
or an alternating assignment sequence based on entrance exam scores that 
preserves mean test score balance and avoids stratification across classrooms. The 
randomness of assignment of children to classrooms in Chinese middle schools 
and its appropriateness for causal inference has been probed in several recent 
papers, many of which use this same dataset6,24,51.
Supplementary Table 1 presents summary statistics for students, by gender, 
for students in our estimation sample. The girls in our sample are slightly younger 
than the boys and they are more likely to have wealthier, more educated parents. 
Girls also have more siblings, consistent with traditional norms and fertility 
responses to birth control policy in China which permits further parity, in some 
cases, if the first child is a girl52. Finally, in all subjects, girls perform better than 
boys on average. This differs somewhat from Programme for International Student 
Assessment (PISA) results: in the 2009 PISA results for China, boys significantly 
outperformed girls in mathematics but in the 2015 PISA results, this difference was 
no longer significant. PISA data, however, apply only to a select group of children 
from urban areas: Shanghai (2009) or Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Guangdong 
(2015). Our data come from a nationally representative sample of middle schools 
across China and include both rural and urban areas. In Supplementary Fig. 1, 
we show the distribution of maths test scores by gender. The distribution for girls 
first-order stochastically dominates that for boys (n = 8,028; Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
two-sample equality-of-distributions test P < 0.001), with the largest difference in 
the left tail of the distribution.
One important feature of the context we study is that middle-school children 
are much more exposed to their classmates than in other contexts, such as those 
in Europe or the United States. Specifically, children are assigned to a class and 
then follow their classmates to each class, so that the same group of students takes 
mathematics together, Chinese together, English together and so on. The school 
day is longer in middle school than in primary school and often includes an 
‘evening session’ for additional study and these are often grouped by home-room 
class53. As a result, the students we study have far greater exposure to each other 
than they would in other contexts, which means that there is greater scope for the 
transmission of beliefs via the various channels (discussion, demonstration and 
passive observation) that we outline above. A key advantage of this feature is that 
it provides an ideal setting for detecting the existence of these effects. A potential 
disadvantage is that, should there be a significant positive correlation between 
per-day hours of exposure and effect size, the magnitude of effect will vary by 
context-specific variation in the proportion of hours children spend with their 
school peers each day.
Our measure of peer parents’ beliefs. Here, we describe how we construct our 
measure of the proportion of peers whose parents believe that boys are innately 
better than girls at learning math, that is, who believe that Bm > Gm. We also 
describe the properties of this measure.
We wish to measure a latent variable: each parent’s beliefs about the innate 
ability of boys and girls in mathematics. We use a datapoint that the CEPS collects 
from the interviewed parent of each child to proxy for this. The CEPS asks the 
parent whether or not they agree with the statement ‘boys’ natural ability in 
studying mathematics is greater than that of girls’. Approximately 41% of parents 
agree with the statement, with the remaining 59% disagreeing. This belief is 
surprisingly common given the fact that, in China, girls generally outperform boys 
in mathematics at this level of schooling51. In the introduction, we argue that this 
pattern is at least partly the result of the fact that parent beliefs were most probably 
formed when the parent was a child, given that (1) beliefs are generally more 
malleable at younger ages and (2) the parents of the children in our sample were 
themselves children in the 1970s and 1980s, at a time in which son preference in 
China was stronger than it is today54.
As described in the introduction, we use this question to generate a child-level 
variable summarizing the beliefs of the parents of the child’s peers in their 
randomly assigned classroom. Specifically, we create a leave-one-out measure 
which captures, for each child, the proportion of peers in their classroom whose 
parents report believing that Bm > Gm, a variable that could potentially range from 
0 to 1. In our data, the actual values of the variable range from 0 to 0.833, with a 
mean of 0.410 and a standard deviation of 0.112. At three significant figures, the 
mean of this variable is the same for girls and boys. Once standardized, the variable 
ranges from −3.597 to 3.739 s.d.
In Supplementary Table 2, we summarize the characteristics of parents who 
do and do not believe that Bm > Gm, respectively. We see differences for some 
characteristics (household income, number of siblings, parent’s age, gender of 
the child) but these differences are small in magnitude. Our interpretation of the 
patterns in this table is that, overall, these two groups of parents are similar on 
most observable characteristics associated with the other traditional drivers of  
peer effects.
In the last part of this section, we briefly discuss how parent beliefs may be 
formed. We are unable to use CEPS data to study how parents’ beliefs were formed 
but, as we describe elsewhere in this paper, we argue that parent beliefs are likely 
to be formed primarily when the parents themselves are children. The formation 
of beliefs in childhood is likely to be the result of diverse inputs—one’s own 
parents18, their peers23, television and other national media55 and their community. 
The contribution of the community is important because if the parent stays in 
the community when they raise their own children, the community may also 
contribute directly to the beliefs of the parent’s child. China’s compulsory education 
law requires that children go to school near their homes when possible, meaning 
that in most cases, all children within a school come from a concentrated local 
area. In our regressions, we control for grade-by-school fixed effects. This means

that we are estimating the effect of random variation in exposure to these messages 
within the community the school draws from and our estimates exclude variation 
in these messages across communities. Furthermore, the research we cite earlier 
showing that child beliefs are more malleable than parent beliefs means that 
parents’ beliefs are most likely to have been influenced by their community when 
they themselves were children, rather than at the time of measurement, when they 
are themselves the parents of adolescents.
Sources of variation in our PPB measure. Our study exploits the fact that 
across our units of observation—pairs of classrooms, within a grade, within a 
school—there is wide dispersion in the main explanatory variable, the proportion 
of children’s parents who hold this belief. Here, we characterize that dispersion. 
There are two sources of variation in the classroom average proportion of parents 
who believe that Bm > Gm: (1) differences between schools and (2) differences 
between classes, within schools (the latter being our level of comparison). We 
can decompose overall variation to characterize the contribution of each source. 
Were our variation to come predominantly from between-school differences, 
then our comparison between classes, within a grade within each school, 
could precisely estimate the impact of small changes in PPB. This comparison, 
however, would have little to say about larger changes, as they would necessitate 
out-of-sample predictions.
In Supplementary Fig. 2, we show two plots describing the variation between 
classrooms in the proportion of parents who believe that Bm > Gm. Supplementary 
Fig. 2A shows, for each classroom, the proportion of parents who agree with the 
statement that boys are better than girls in learning mathematics. This shows a 
roughly symmetric distribution around 41%, the mean, with a range from 7% 
to almost 80%. Supplementary Fig. 2B shows how our measure of parent beliefs 
varies within each of the 86 within-school, within-grade pairs of classrooms 
in our data. We plot each pair as a point, with the standardized class-average 
parent beliefs for class 1 shown on the x axis, and that for class 2 on the y axis. 
We see large differences in parent beliefs between classrooms in these pairs. A 
simple decomposition of variance finds that between-school variation explains 
less than one-third of the overall variation in classroom-level parent beliefs and 
within-school, between classroom variation explains the remaining (more than 
two-thirds of) overall variation. This allows us to estimate the impact of many 
different ‘treatment intensities’ while controlling for school fixed effects, thus 
removing the influence of unobservable traits that may vary from school to school.
A separate way to capture the differences in this variable between classrooms, 
within a grade, within each school, is to calculate the absolute value of the 
difference in the (standardized) parent beliefs measure between classroom 1 and 
classroom 2. We calculate this value for every grade-by-school pair of classrooms; 
its value varies between 0.1 and 4.35 s.d., with a mean of 1 s.d. We show the 
distribution of these values in Supplementary Fig. 3.
Assessing random assignment. In this section, we evaluate our claim that children 
are, in fact, randomly assigned to their classrooms. First, we note that we follow 
the sample restriction of several previous papers that have used these data. These 
papers show that using this sample restriction yields a dataset of children who are 
randomly assigned to classrooms within a school, as evidenced by the results they 
present in their tests of randomization/balance24,51,56.
We further probe the claim of random assignment of children to classrooms 
by regressing our PPB measure on the child-level characteristics in Cicgs from 
our estimating equation, all of which are predetermined relative to classroom 
assignment. This approach follows recent studies analysing classroom-level 
randomization in other contexts57–59. We present our results in Supplementary 
Table 3. In column 1 of the table, we show the results for regressing PPB on the 
vector of predetermined characteristics without any fixed effects; in column 2, 
we add controls for the grade-by-school fixed effects used in our main estimating 
equation. Our results in column 2 fail to reject the null that the regressors do 
not significantly predict variation in PPB within schools, within grades, between 
classrooms.
The random assignment of children to classes prevents our estimates of β1 
and β2 from being confounded by potential non-random sorting of children to 
classrooms, either by ability or parent preference. Were such sorting to exist, 
our estimates of the effect of exposure to more peers whose parents believe that 
Bm > Gm would also comprise the other effects of such sorting. For example, since 
girls outperform boys in mathematics in our sample (Supplementary Fig. 1), 
placing more able students together would lead to more girls in higher performing 
classrooms. This would lead to two differences: (1) more girl-to-girl (boy-to-boy) 
exposure in high-performing (low-performing) classrooms; (2) in high-performing 
classrooms, greater salutary effects of having more girl peers24. Random assignment 
also prevents confounding from two other potential sources: (1) that schools 
re-allocate teacher and classroom resources towards (or away from) higher-ability 
classrooms; (2) that parents with certain characteristics request their children to be 
among the children of similar parents.
Channels of transmission. Here, we study the relative importance of two potential 
channels of peer parent belief transmission to children: (1) from peers’ parents 
directly to the child herself; (2) from the peers’ parents to the peer and then from 
the peer to the child. Prior research finds that the direct channel is an important 
factor in shaping US girls’ beliefs about their place in the labour market10. We 
present two analyses to study this. The first uses two new measures of PPB—peer 
mother beliefs and peer father beliefs. These are constructed in a way that is 
similar to the way that peer girl and peer boy parent beliefs are constructed, only 
in this case we use the identity of the parent whose response the survey captures 
to generate the variable. On average, mothers in China spend a larger portion 
of their time interacting with children than do fathers60. If the main channel of 
transmission were from peer parents to the child (as opposed to from parents to 
the child and then from the child to their peers), we should see larger effects for 
peer mothers than peer fathers. In Supplementary Table 7, we present our results; 
we find that the estimate for peer mothers’ beliefs and peer fathers’ beliefs have 
similar magnitudes and we cannot exclude that they are identical.
While there may be additional variation across parents who have more or less 
interaction with the child, the only related datapoint collected in the CEPS is each 
parent’s response to the following yes/no question: ‘do you know the friends that 
your child often spends time with?’ A high proportion (87.8% of parents) respond 
‘yes’ to this question. We find that using this interaction to estimate whether peer 
parents who know their children’s friends have greater transmission of beliefs has 
no more descriptive power than using a random sample of an equal proportion 
of parents (who may or may not interact with their children’s friends). Given the 
flaws of this particular measure, we argue that this test is inconclusive. Overall, 
these tests suggest that the main channel is probably from the parent to the child 
and then from the child to their peers, rather than directly from peer parents to 
the child.
Exploration of heterogeneity. We conduct additional analysis of three dimensions 
of potential heterogeneity in the effects we measure. They are: (1) whether there 
are differential effects by the child’s pretest maths ability; (2) whether there are 
differential effects by the child’s mother’s highest level of education; and (3) 
whether there are differential effects by whether the child’s mother has a higher 
level of education than the father. We also test for interaction effects between own 
parent beliefs and PPB. Finally, we examine whether there are greater test score 
effects among children at highly competitive schools than at other schools.
For investigation of heterogeneity by pretest maths ability, mother’s highest 
level of education and parental education gaps, we create binary variables to 
capture each concept. The pretest maths ability is split by low (0) versus high (1) 
performance in the final year of primary school mathematics (mean = 0.651); 
maternal education is split by low (0) versus high (1) maternal education (in our 
case, whether the mother attended high school; mean = 0.390); and the parental 
education gap is split by whether the mother has a higher level of education than 
the father (mean = 0.134). In each analysis, we add the binary variable in question, 
along with its interaction with PPB and gender, respectively, as well as the triple 
interaction (variable × PPB × gender), to the estimating equation. We report 
coefficients for all seven coefficients, for each of our two main outcome variables: 
the child’s likelihood of believing that Bm > Gm and the child’s maths test score.
To study the interaction between own parent beliefs and PPB, we use a 
similar specification, adding the triple interaction to the estimating equation (the 
variable and its interaction are already present in our prior analyses). To study 
heterogeneity in whether the effects for test scores vary with whether the child 
attends a highly competitive school, we split the sample by whether the school is 
reported to be ‘among the best’ schools in its prefecture, a rough proxy for how 
competitive it is (true for 25.1% of the schools in our sample)61.
We find no evidence of statistically significant interaction between exposure to 
peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm and pretest maths ability in terms of the 
transmission of beliefs; we show these results in Supplementary Table 8. We do find 
a statistically significant interaction between exposure to girl peers whose parents 
believe that Bm > Gm and high baseline maths ability (an additional effect of −0.084; 
CI −0.150 to −0.018; P = 0.013); we show these results in Supplementary Table 9. 
We find no evidence of a statistically significant relationship between maternal 
education and either belief transmission or its effects on test scores (results in 
Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). For the parental education gap, the pattern 
is somewhat more complicated. In Supplementary Table 12, we show estimates 
for child beliefs as the outcome variable. We estimate a statistically significant 
interaction between the gap (the child’s mother having more education than the 
father) and the beliefs of girl peers’ parents, with a positive and significant effect 
overall (effect estimate: 0.043; CI 0.004 to 0.082; P = 0.033) and a negative and 
significant effect for the interaction with the child being female (effect estimate 
−0.076; CI −0.131 to −0.021; P = 0.007). We show relevant results for maths test 
scores in Supplementary Table 13. Here, the interaction between the gap and 
all peer parents’ beliefs is also positive and significant (effect estimate: 0.101; 
CI 0.020 to 0.182; P = 0.015). We find no evidence of a statistically significant 
interaction between own parent beliefs and PPB for either the transmission of 
beliefs (Supplementary Table 14) or maths test scores (Supplementary Table 15). 
Finally, splitting the sample by high-performing schools also reduces our statistical 
power to detect effects: while the magnitude of the point estimates for the effect of 
exposure to peers whose parents believe that Bm > Gm on maths performance are 
roughly twice as large in highly competitive schools as in less competitive schools, 
these differences are not statistically significant (Supplementary Tables 16 and 17).

Other statistical methods. We used a two-tailed α of 0.05 for all statistical tests 
and, when estimating our models, assume normally distributed errors; we do not 
formally test this because we are unable to directly observe properties of the error 
term. Because we use observational data, where data collection and randomization 
were conducted by (separate) third parties, our analysis did not require any 
additional human subjects ethical review. For the same reason, our sample sizes 
were determined by data availability rather than prospective sample size or power 
calculations. All of our analyses were conducted using Stata MP v.16.0. Our code is

Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement
A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
A description of all covariates tested
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons
A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) 
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)
For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 
Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.
For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings
For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes
Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated
Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

Study description
This is a quantitative, quasi-experimental analysis. Our analysis exploits the random assignment of students to classrooms in 
(Chinese) middle schools, a frequently used method in the study of peer effects which, in our case, generates random variation in the 
proportion of peers in a child’s classroom with parents who hold this belief. We use this to estimate the effect of being assigned to a 
peer group with a high proportion of parents who believe boys are innately better than girls at learning math on a child's beliefs and 
demonstrated math ability.
Research sample
The China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) is a large-scale, nationally representative, longitudinal survey of two cohorts – the 7th and 
9th graders in the 2013-2014 academic year. The website which provides the original data (http://ceps.ruc.edu.cn/English/Overview/
Overview.htm) says this about the data: "The CEPS applies a stratified, multistage sampling design with probability proportional to 
size (PPS), randomly selecting a school-based, nationally representative sample of approximately 20,000 students in 438 classrooms 
of 112 schools in 28 county-level units in mainland China. The baseline survey of CEPS was completed in the 2013-2014 academic 
year, conducted by National Survey Research Center (NSRC) at Renmin University of China." We restrict this sample to only school-
grade combinations which randomly assign students to classrooms, a restriction used in prior research using these data (Wang, H., 
Cheng, Z. & Smyth, R. Do migrant students affect local students’ academic achievements in urban China? 2018. Economics of 
Education Review 63, 64–77 ; Gong, J., Lu, Y. & Song, H. The effect of teacher gender on students’ academic and noncognitive 
outcomes, 2018. Journal of Labor Economics 36, 743–778; and Eble, A. and Hu, F., 2020. Child beliefs, societal beliefs, and teacher-
student identity match. Economics of Education Review, 77, 101994.). In our final sample, the average age is 13.2, and 49.2 percent 
of the observations are female. This is similar to these characteristics in the original data.
Sampling strategy
No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes; we used all data which fit our inclusion criteria (described under 
"data exclusions"). Our sample sizes are larger than those reported in other recent studies of peer effects (Olivetti, C., Patacchini, E. & 
Zenou, Y., 2020. Mothers, peers, and gender-role identity. Journal of the European Economic Association 18, 266–301; Fruehwirth, J. 
C. & Gagete-Miranda, J., 2019. Your peers’ parents: Spillovers from parental education. Economics of Education Review 73, 101910; 
and Chung, B. W. 2020 Peers’ Parents and Educational Attainment: The Exposure Effect. Labour Economics 101812.)
Data collection
Not applicable; we did not collect our own data.
Timing
Not applicable; we did not collect our own data. 
Data exclusions
We use the selected sample, as also used in other research (e.g., citations 15 and 23 in our manuscript), focusing only students in 
schools where there is random assignment of children to classrooms in a given grade. These criteria were pre-established relative to 
our analysis of the data.
Non-participation
No human participants were involved in our study.
Randomization
Across China, various methods are used for assignment of children to classes, including random number generators, alphabetical 
assignment based on surname, or an alternating assignment sequence based on entrance exam scores that preserves mean test 
score balance and avoids stratification across classrooms. The randomness of assignment of children to classrooms in Chinese middle 
schools and its appropriateness for causal inference has been probed in several recent papers, many of which use this same dataset 
(see citations 6 and 15 in the manuscript). In Table S3 we provide additional analysis of randomization fidelity. As is the case in the 
analysis of this data in the other aforementioned citations, our analyses also support the claim that there was random assignment of 
children to classes in this sample.
Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods
