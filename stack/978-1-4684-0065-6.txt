Preface 
This book is written as an introduction to higher algebra for students with 
a background of a year of calculus. The book developed out of a set of 
notes for a sophomore-junior level course at the State University of New 
York at Albany entitled Classical Algebra. 
In the 1950s and before, it was customary for the first course in algebra 
to be a course in the theory of equations, consisting of a study of 
polynomials over the complex, real, and rational numbers, and, to a lesser 
extent, linear algebra from the point of view of systems of equations. 
Abstract algebra, that is, the study of groups, rings, and fields, usually 
followed such a course. 
In recent years the theory of equations course has disappeared. Without 
it, students entering abstract algebra courses tend to lack the experience in 
the algebraic theory of the basic classical examples of the integers and 
polynomials necessary for understanding, and more importantly, for ap-
preciating the formalism. To meet this problem, several texts have recently 
appeared introducing algebra through number theory. 
This book combines the newer number-theoretic approach with the old 
theory of equations. In fact, the book contains enough of each of elemen-
tary number theory and the theory of equations that a course in either 
could be taught from it (see below). But the algebraic similarities of the 
two subjects are such that both subjects can be developed in parallel, and 
ideas customarily associated with one can be transferred to the other. Thus 
the ideas of congruence and congruence classes, normally arising in 
elementary number theory, can also be used with polynomials. Doing so 
permits passage from the study of polynomials to the study of simple field 
extensions, and in particular, leads to an exposition of finite fields. 
There are, I feel, several advantages in beginning the study of higher 
algebra by studying number theory and polynomial theory.

Preface 
First, the algebra is built on the student's entire mathematical experi-
ence. The study of numbers and polynomial equations dominates the 
precollege mathematical training. By building on this background a course 
in algebra will be building on the strongest possible intuitive base. And 
given such a base, the potential for reaching results of significance is high. 
I hope that this potential is realized by this book's theoretical development, 
numerous applications, and exercises. 
Second, the dominating algebraic idea in the development of the book is 
that of congruence classes. The concept of quotient structure is perhaps the 
most difficult of the concepts of abstract algebra. The experience of seeing 
it in a variety of concrete contexts, and seeing worthwhile consequences of 
its use, should greatly aid the student when subsequently it is seen in 
abstract presentations. This particular feature of our approach is one 
which was missing from traditional theory of equations courses, and also is 
missing in courses in linear algebra used as background for abstract 
algebra. 
Third, the subject matter of the book is intrinsically worth studying. 
Both number theory and the theory of equations have attracted the 
attention of the very greatest mathematicians. In particular, two of Gauss's 
greatest achievements, the fundamental theorem of algebra and the law of 
quadratic reciprocity, are important results in this book. One of the 
important lines of research in modern algebraic geometry stems from 
A. Weirs 1949 paper on solutions of equations in finite fields, a topic 
which is beyond the level, but very much in the tradition, of the material in 
this book (see Ireland and Rosen (1972) for an exposition). But even at the 
level of this book the subjects have attracted the notice of combinatorial 
analysts and computer scientists in recent decades. A surprising amount of 
the material in this book dates from since 1940. As I discovered only late 
in the writing of this book, there is considerable overlap between it and the 
mathematics in Chapter 4, "Arithmetic," of D. E. Knuth's fundamental 
treatise, The Art of Computer Programming (Knuth, 1969). Thus the 
mathematics in this book is worth learning for its own sake, apart from 
any value it has in preparing for more advanced mathematics. 
The explicit prerequisites of the book consist for the most part only of 
high school algebra (in the de facto sense, not in the sense of Abhyankar 
(l976)-in his sense this is predominantly a high school algebra text). In 
various places we assume some acquaintance with calculus; however, the 
subject of differentiating polynomials is developed from the beginning 
(Chapter 11-6), and the one place where integration occurs explicitly 
(Section II-SC) may be omitted.) Two-variable calculus is mentioned only 
in the proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra (11-3), but either the 
facts .needed there can be taken on faith or the proof can be omitted. The 
I Chapter 6 of Part II is referred to as Chapter 11-6 or simply as 11-6; if the reference occurs 
within Part II, simply as Chapter 6. 11-5C refers to Section C of Chapter 11-5.

use of infinite series is more substantial, however, particularly in connec-
tion with decimal expansions of fractions. 
Several of the applications and a few of the theoretical sections use 
matrices and ideas from linear algebra. Chapter 1-9 is an overly concise 
review of the necessary ideas. Sections C-F of 1-9 should be used only for 
reference. If linear algebra is lacking in the student's background, the 
chapters particularly to avoid are 11-12 and the last half of III-9. The 
remaining uses of linear algebra mainly involve simple matrix manipula-
tions as described in Section 1-9A, and these are quickly learned. 
Exercises are scattered throughout the text as well as collected at the 
ends of sections. They range from routine examples to ingenious problems 
to extensions of theory. The most nontrivial ones are starred; comments on 
them are collected in the back of the book. Exercises which are mentioned 
subsequently either in the text or in exercises are marked with a dagger, 
and are indexed together with the subsequent references in the back of the 
book. 
There is more material in this book than would be appropriate for a one 
semester course. For a year course it could be supplemented with a 
not-too-geometric introduction to linear algebra (such as Zelinsky (1973)). 
For a one semester course there are a variety of routes through the book. 
The main development in Parts 1 and II is contained in 
1-: 1-3, 4A, SA, B, D, 6-8, 11, 14A; 
II-: 1,2, 3A, 4, 6, 8-10, IIA. 
To get to the classification of finite fields (III-14) most efficiently, 
follow the main development with 
III-: 1,4, 7, 8, 10, 11, (12), 13, 14. 
To get to algebraic numbers (111-18) most efficiently, follow the main 
development with 
III-: 1,4,7,8, 10, 16A, B, 18-21. 
To concentrate on elementary number theory, see 
1-: all except 9C-F and 4B, 4C, 5C, 9B, 10, 13, 14B, 15 as desired; 
II-: I, 2A; 
III-: 1-5, 16A, B, 17; then 
II-: 3A, 8-10, llA; 
III-: 7,8, 10, 18-21. 
To concentrate on theory of equations, see: 
1-: 1-3, 4A, 6-8, II, 14A;

III-: 1,4,6-8, 10, 11, 13-16.

Preface 
It is probably unwise to spend too much time in Chapter 1-2. Also, part 
of the uniqueness of this book lies in the chapters on applications, so it is 
hoped that any route through the book will be chosen to allow time for 
visits to some of the scenic wayside areas. 
Finally, I wish to acknowledge with appreciation the contributions of 
people who in various ways influenced the book: Ed Davis, for developing 
and selling the idea for the course for which the book was written, and for 
a number of useful comments on an early version of the notes; Bill 
Hammond, for teaching from the notes and offering a number of improve-
ments; Violet Lamey, for teaching from the notes graciously even though 
her book (for a competing course) had just appeared; Morris Orzech, 
Paulo Ribenboim, Tony Geramita, Ted Turner, and Ivan Niven, for a 
variety of mathematical insights and ideas; and, especially, Malcolm 
Smiley, for reading through and teaching from the manuscript in its late 
stages and offering many substantial suggestions for improving the exposi-
tion, and David Drasin, for reading through and making many helpful 
comments on the nearly completed manuscript. Also I wish to thank: 
Michele Palleschi for typing most of the manuscript even though she didn't 
have to, and Mrs. Betty Turner and her staff for typing most of the 
manuscript even though they weren't supposed to; the Universities of 
Illinois (Urbana) and Oregon for their hospitality during part of the time 
the book was written; and Springer-Verlag, particularly Walter 
Kaufmann-Buehler and Joe Gannon, for their professional treatment of 
the manuscript. Most of all, my greatest thanks go to my wife Rhonda, for 
putting up with my working on the manuscript at inconvenient hours at 
inconvenient locations.

I. INTEGERS 
This part of the book is about the natural numbers and integers. Among 
the highlights of this part, we show that every natural number factors 
uniquely into a product of primes, define congruence mod m, and invent 
new sets called congruence classes mod m, which for each m > 2 add and 
multiply to form a new algebraic system called lm. Various related results 
about numbers, and applications, fill out this part. 

Numbers 1 
This book is about the algebraic structure of sets of numbers and poly-
nomials. Here are the most familiar sets of numbers and the way we shall 
denote them. 
1\1 is the set of natural or counting numbers: 
1,2,3,4,5 ... 
7l.. is the set of integers: 
... , -3, -2, -1,0,1,2,3,4, 
7l.. is obtained from 1\1 by including ° 
(zero) and the negatives of the natural 
numbers. 
Q is the set of rational numbers, that is, the set of all fractions a / b, 
where b =1= 0 and a are integers. The set of integers 7l.. is thought of as a 
subset of Q by identifying the integer a with a/I. Q is the smallest set 
containing 7l.. in which every nonzero integer has an inverse, or reciprocal. 
(See Exercise E6.) 
IR is the set of real numbers. A useful way to think of IR is as the set of 
all infinite decimals. Real numbers can also be viewed geometrically, as 
lengths of directed line segments on a given straight line, or equivalently as 
coordinates on a given line (such as the x-axis used in calculus). Any 
rational number is a real number; the decimal expansion of a rational 
number a/ b may be obtained by the familiar process of dividing b into a. 
One way to define the real numbers is as limits of sequences (Cauchy 
sequences) of rational numbers. (In fact, an infinite decimal .a1a2a3 ••• is 
a limit of finite decimals .a1a2 ••• an' and each such is a rational number.) 
However, it is possible to use real numbers without having a precise 
understanding of how they are defined. Calculus, which uses real numbers 
in an essential way, was invented and used for 200 years before a rigorous 

4 
I Numbers 
definition of real numbers was achieved. So we shall adopt the 18th-
century point of view and assume that the real numbers are understood, at 
least intuitively if not rigorously, and we shall say no more about their 
definition in this book. 
C is the set of complex numbers, that is, the set of numbers of the form 
a + bi, a, b in IR, where i = V-l . You are probably less familiar with 
complex numbers than with real or rational numbers. Historically, they 
only became well understood and accepted early in the 19th century, well 
over a century after the development of the calculus. 
We may think of C as the set of vectors (= directed line segments) in 
the plane, with a + bi corresponding to the vector from the origin to the 
point with coordinates (a, b). If v = a + bi, a is called the real part of v, 
and b the imaginary part of v. 
A convenient way to represent elements of C is in terms of polar 
coordinates (see diagram). If r is the distance from the origin to the point 
(a, b) (that is, r = Va 2 + b2 ) and 0 is the angle (measured counterclock-
wise) from the positive real axis to the vector v, then a = r cos 0, b = 
r sin 0, so v = a + bi = r cos 0 + ir sin O. The real number r is called the 
length of v and is denoted Ivl; 0 is called the argument of v and is 
sometimes denoted arg v. Multiplication of complex numbers when de-
scribed in polar coordinates works rather neatly: 
(r cos 0 + ir sin 0 )(s cos cf> + is sin cf» 
= rs((cos 0 cos cf> - sin 0 sin cf» + i(cos 0 sin cf> + sin 0 cos cf») 
(1) 
= rs(cos(O + cf» + i sin(O + cf») 
That is, when multiplying two complex numbers, lengths multiply and 
arguments add.

which would be the same as the Taylor series for the complex function eix 
if we knew what eix was. So we define eix for x real by setting eix = cos x 
+ i sin x: that is, we define eix by replacing x by ix in the Taylor series for 
eX. 
Then an arbitrary complex number v can be written in polar form as 
v = r(cos 0 + i sin 0) = re i9; 
if w is another complex number, w = seit/>, the multiplication of formula (1) 
above becomes 
vw = re i9se it/> = rse i(9+t/», 
which is exactly what one would expect from the laws of exponents that 
you learneq in high school. 
From an algebraic point of view C, R, and C are different from 71... In 71.. 
the equation ax = I can be solved only when a = I or -1, but in C, R, or 
C (see E5) every nonzero element has a reciprocal, or inverse. Thus, as we 
shall see, C, R, and C are examples of fields of numbers, while 71.. is not. 
We conclude this introductory chapter with a remark on logical nota-
tion. Frequently we shall make statements like "P is true iff Q is true," 
where P, Q are assertions. "iff' means "if and only if." The statement 
means: "If P is true then Q is true and if P is false then Q is false." If an 
exercise contains a statement to be proved which includes an "iff," there 
are really two statements which are to be proved. See Exercise E7 for an 
example.

(a, b) == (c, d) iff ad = bc. 
Show: 
(i) (a, b) == (a, b); 
(ii) if (a, b) == (c, d), then (c, d) == (a, b); 
(iii) if (a, b)==(c, d) and (c, d) == (e,j), then (a, b)==(e,j).

(These conditions are called reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity respec-
tively. If == is a relation such that (i), (ii), (iii) hold, then == is called an 
equivalence relation. The set of all pairs (c, d) which are == to (a, b) is called 
the equivalence class of (a, b). For == as defined here, the equivalence class of 
(a, b) is denoted a / b. Thus, a / b = c / d means: the equivalence class of (a, b) 
is the same as the equivalence class of (c, d); this in turn means that 
(a, b) == (c, d), which in turn means that ad = bc. The set a of rational 
numbers is defined to be the set of equivalence classes with respect to == of 
ordered pairs (a, b) of integers with b =!= 0.) 
E7. Is the following fact from calculus true? If so, how is it proved? Letf(x) be a 
function which is differentiable for all x, a ..; x ..; b. Then f(x) is a constant 
function iff J'(x) = 0 for all x, a ..; x ..; b. 

Induction; the Binomial 2 
Theorem 
A. Induction 
The first part of the course deals with the integers Z and the natural 
numbers 1':1. You know how to add and subtract, multiply and divide 
integers, and you know when one integer is bigger than another; we shall 
not review these things. One property of the integers which does need 
review is the principle of induction. It is the basis for most proofs involving 
natural numbers, for it gives a general procedure for verifying statements 
about all natural numbers (an infinite set). It comes in various formula-
tions. Here is the first. 
Induction (1). Let Pen) be a statement which makes sense for any integer 
n ~ no. If 
(a) P(no) is true, and 
(b) If Pen) is true, then Pen + 1) is true for all n ~ no in Z 
then Pen) is true for all n ~ no in Z. 
You have probably seen this principle used before, perhaps in evaluat-
ing sums arising in connection with the definite integral. 
Here are some examples of arguments by induction. 
EXAMPLE 1. 1 + 3 + 5 + ... +(2n - 1) = n2 for all n ~ 1. 
PROOF. Denote the assertion by Pen). The statement P(l) is true, since 
1 = 12. Assume that for some number k, P(k) is true, that is, 1 + 3 + 5 + 
... + (2k - 1) = k 2• We look at the left side of the assertion P(k + 1): 
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k + 1) 
= [I + 3 + 5 + . . . + (2k - 1)] + (2k + 2).

2 Induction; the Binomial Theorem 
By assumption that P(k) is true we can replace the expression inside the 
square brackets by k 2: 
= k 2 + (2k + 1) 
= (k + 1)2. 
Thus assuming P(k) is true, it follows that P(k + 1) is true. By induction 
pen) is true for all n # 1. 
0 
The rationale behind induction is that if statements (a) and (b) are true, 
then for any n # no one can prove, in n - no steps, that pen) is true. For 
example, if pen) is the equation (1) above and we wish to prove that P(5) is 
true, we can argue logically using statements (a) and (b), as follows: 
P(1) is true, by statement (a). 
Since P(1) is true, P(2) is true, by statement (b) with n = 1. 
Since P(2) is true, P(3) is true, by statement (b) with n = 2. 
Since P(3) is true, P(4) is true, by statement (b) with n = 3. 
Since P(4) is true, P(5) is true, by statement (b) with n = 4. 
This same kind of argument can be done, once we have shown 
(a) P(l) is true, and 
(b) For all n, if pen) is true, then pen + 1) is true, 
to show in n logical steps that pen) is true for any n # 1. The principle of 
induction simply asserts that given (a) and (b), and any n # 1, pen) can be 
shown true, and that therefore pen) is true for any n. 
Here are some more examples. 
EXAMPLE 2. For all n # 1, 2n # 1 + n. 
PROOF. The statement is clearly true when n = 1. Supposing that 2k # 1 + 
k for some k # I, then it follows that 2k+ 1 = 2k. 2 # (1 + k)2 = 2k + 2 > 1 
+ (k + 1). Thus the inequality is true for all n # 1 by induction. 
0 
EXAMPLE 3. For all n # 0, 8 divides 32n -
1 (that is, 32n -
1 = 8k for some 
integer k). 
PROOF. The statement is true for n = ° 
since 8 divides 30 -
1 = 0. Suppose 
8 divides 32k - 1. We examine 32(k+ I) -
1: 
32(k+ I) _ 1 = 32k . 32 -
1 = 32k . 32 - 32 + 32 -
I 
= 32(32k - 1) + (32 - 1). 
Since 8 divides 32k - 1 and 8 = 32 -
1, therefore 8 divides 32(32k - 1) + 
(32 -
I) = 32(k+l) - 1. Thus the statement is true for all n # O.

E6. Consider the ancient puzzle called the Tower of Hanoi. 
The puzzle consists of n disks of decreasing diameter placed on a pole. There 
are two other poles. The problem is to move the entire pile to another pole by 
moving one disk at a time to any other pole, except that no disk may be placed 
on top of a smaller disk. Find a formula for the least number of moves needed 
to move n disks from one pole to another, and prove the formula by induction.

We may assume by induction that in the set L of the n babies to the left all 
have the same color eyes, and similarly that in the set R of the n babies to 
the right all have the same color eyes. But then evidently all the n + 1 
babies have the same color eyes, for the leftmost and rightmost babies 
have the same color eyes as all the babies in between. 
By induction, for any n, in every set of n babies all have the same color 
eyes. Since the set of all babies is one such set, the theorem is proved.

B. Another Form of Induction 
Induction (2). Let Pen) be a statement which makes sense for any integer 
n ~ no' If 
(a/) P(no) is true, and 
(b/) For all n > no, if P(m) is true for all m, no < m < n, then Pen) is true, 
then Pen) is true for all integers n ~ no' 
Here is an example of the use of induction (2), an example which is not 
so easily done using induction (1): 
EXAMPLE 6. Any natural number n ~ 2 factors into a product of prime 
numbers. 
Recall that a natural number n is prime if n does not factor into the 
product of two natural numbers each smaller than n. We adopt the 
convention that a prime is a product of (one!) primes. 
PROOF. Let Pen) be the statement "n is a product of primes." Then P(2) is 
true since 2 is prime (hence is a product of primes by our convention). 
Suppose P(m) is true for all m < n. If n is prime, Pen) is true. If not, 
n = ab, with a < n, b < n. So Pea) is true and PCb) is true, that is, a and b 
are both products of primes. But then n = ab is also, and Pen) is true. By 
induction (2), Pen) is true for all n ~ 2. 
D 
Note. The statement of Example (6) is part of the fundamental theorem 
of arithmetic, which we will prove in full in Chapter 3. 
Theorem. If induction (1) is true then induction (2) is true. 
PROOF. Let Pen) be an assertion and suppose we know of it: 
(a/) P(no) is true; 
(h') For all n > no, if P(m) is true for all m, no < m < n, then Pen) is true. 
Let Q(n) be the assertion, "P(m) is true for all m, no < m < n." 
To show Pen) is true for all n it suffices to show that Q(n) is true for all 
n. We show Q(n) is true by induction (1). 
We must show: 
(a) Q(no) is true; 
(b) For any n > no, if Q(n - 1) is true then Q(n) is true. 
Assertion (a) is the same as (a/), so is true. For (h), suppose Q(n - 1) is 
true. Then P(m) is true for all m, no < m < n - 1. By (h'), Pen) is true. 
So P(m) is true for all m, no < m < n. So Q(n) is true. 
By induction (1), Q(n) is true for all n. That completes the proof.

tE9. Russian peasant arithmetic. Here is a way of multiplying attributed to Russian 
peasants who could only add, and multiply and divide by 2. 
To multiply a and b put a and b at the top of two columns and fill in the 
columns below by multiplying the left number by 2 and dividing the right 
number by 2. Whenever division of the right number by 2 yields a new right 
number which is odd, subtract one from that new right number before 
dividing by 2 again, and put the corresponding left number in the sum 
column. When you reach the number I in the right column add the sum 
column to get the answer. Here is an example.

The golden mean b : a was considered to be the most perfect ratio for the 
lengths of the sides of rectangular designs, such as portraits. The golden mean 
relates to the Fibonacci sequence by the following two facts:

(prove this using (b». 
It follows from (c) that the golden mean can be approximated by ratios of 
consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. 
c. Well-ordering 
Here is another version of induction. 
Well-ordering principle. Let no be any fixed integer. Then any nonempty set 
of integers ~ no has a least element. 
We prove the well-ordering principle using induction (1). To do so we 
prove that if there is a set of integers ~ no with no least element, then it 
must be empty. (This approach uses the standard logical strategy for 
proving statements of the form "if A then B"-we prove that if B is false 
then A must be false. The reason that the strategy works is that the only 
situation under which the statement "if A then B" is false occurs when A is 
true and B is false. If we assume B is false and are able to show thereby 
that A is false, then the situation "A true and B false" cannot hold and so 
"if A then B" is true.) 
PROOF. Let S be a set of integers ~ no with no least element. Let P(n) be 
the statement: "No number ~ n is in S." Observe that if m is in S, then 
P(m) is false. So by showing that P(n) is true for all n ~ no we will show 
that S is empty, which will prove the principle. Evidently P(no) is true, for 
if not, no is in S, and since all numbers in S are ~ no, therefore S would 
have a least element. 
Suppose P(k) is true for some k ~no' If P(k + 1) is false, then some 
number ~ k + I is in S. But P(k) is true. So no such number ~ k is in S. 
But then k + 1, the only number ~ k + 1 and not ~ k, would be in S, and 
would be the least element of S, which is impossible. Thus if P(k) is true, 
so is P(k + I). By induction, P(n) is true for all n, and S is empty. That 
finishes the proof. 
0 
Since the well-ordering principle is true, we can use it in proofs. Here is 
an example. 
EXAMPLE 7. Given nonnegative integers a> 0 and b there exist integers 
q ~ 0 and r with 0 ~ r < a such that b = aq + r. 

14 
2 Induction; the Binomial Theorem 
In practice, q, r are found by long division: 
q 
afb 
r 
q is the quotient, r the remainder. 
We prove the existence of q and r using well-ordering. 
PROOF. Let S = {b - axlx > 0, b - ax > O}. Since b = b - a' 0 is in S, S is 
a nonempty set of integers > 0 (no = 0). So S has a least element, r. We 
show r satisfies the conditions of the theorem. Since r is in S, r > 0, and 
r = b - aq for some q > O. We must show that r <a. Now r - a = b - qa 
- a = b - a(q + 1). So if r > a, then r - a = b - a(q + 1) > 0 would be in 
S. But r - a < rand r was the least element of S. So r - a cannot be > 0, 
so it must be that r < a. That completes the proof. 
0 
It turns out that the well-ordering principle is equivalent to induction. 
You can try to prove it: 
*Ell. (a) Prove that well-ordering implies induction (1). 
(b) Prove that induction (2) is equivalent to well-ordering. (That is, prove: 
(i) if well-ordering is true then induction (2) is true; (ii) if induction (2) is 
true then well-ordering is true.)

The proof is by induction on n, and in order to carry through the 
argument passing from n - 1 to n (the induction step) we first set up 
Pascal's triangle.

We number the elements c(n, r) of Pascal's triangle by the row nand 
the position r of the element with the row, both indices starting from O. 
Thus Pascal's triangle is labeled 
c(O, 0)

and 
c(n, r) = c(n - 1, r - 1) + c(n - 1, r) for 1 < r < n -
1. 
That is, for each n and each r, 1 < r < n - 1, c(n, r) is the sum of the terms 
on its left and right shoulder: 
c(n - 1, r - 1) + c(n - 1, r) 
II 
c(n, r). 
Fact. c(n, r) is the number of r-element subsets of a set S containing n 
elements. 
PROOF. We do this by induction on n, the case n = 1 being obvious. Let S 
be a set with n elements, one of them being the element y. Let So be the set 
of all the elements of S except y. Divide the collection of all r-element 
subsets of S into two piles, one consisting of those subsets containingy, the 
other consisting of those subsets not containingy. The first pile consists of 
exactly those subsets of S obtained by taking an (r - I)-element subset of 
So and adjoining y. Thus there are c(n - 1, r - 1) of those. The second 
pile consists exactly of the r-element subsets of So, of which there are 
c(n - 1, r). Thus the number of r-element subsets of S is c(n - 1, r - 1) + 
c(n - 1, r) = c(n, r), which is what we wished to show.

Unique Factorization into 3 
Products of Primes 
A. Euclid's Algorithm 
The basic algebraic property of 7L which we will use throughout the book is 
the 
Division Theorem. Given integers a > 0 and b ;> 0 there exist unique integers 
q;> 0 and r, 0 < r <a, such that b = qa + r. 
This is on first thought a pretty obvious fact about natural numbers. 
For it is just a restatement of long division, which is familiar from the third 
grade. For example, dividing 3857 by 285 looks like this: 
13 
285 ) 3857 
285 
1007 
855 
152. 
What this means is that 3857 = 285 X 13 + 152. So you know how to 
find q and r for any a and b. 
But if you think about long division it is something of a marvel that it 
works.

3 Unique Factorization into Products of Primes 
We shall prove the division theorem here using induction (2). 
PROOF. Given the divisor a =1= 0 we shall prove that for every b ;;;. 0 there 
exist q, r with 0 ~ r < a such that b = qa + r. 
First, 0 = a' 0 + 0, so when b = 0 we can set q = 0, r = O. 
For b > 0 we use induction (2). 
Suppose that for all c, 0 ~ c < b, there are qo, r 0 with 0 ~ r 0 < a and 
c = qoa + ro. Now consider b. We want to write b as b = qa + r with 
o ~r <a. 
U b < a then b = 0 . a + b; since 0 ~ b < a we can set q == 0, r = b. 
If b;;;'a, let c=b-a. Then O~c<b. By induction, c=a·qo+ro for 
some qo and ro with 0 ~ ro < a. But then 
b = a + c = a + a' qo + ro = a( qo + 1) + ro 
and 0 ~ ro <a. We can set q = qo + 1, r = ro' 
By induction (2), any b > 0 may be written as b = a . q + r with 0 ~ r 
<a. 
As to uniqueness, suppose we have q, r with b = aq + rand 0 ~ r < a, 
ans suppose also that b = aq' + r', where q', r' are possibly different 
integers with 0 ~ r' < a. We are to show that q' must equal q and r' must 
equal r. 
To do this, suppose r' ;;;. r and subtract b = aq' + r' from b = aq + r to 
get a(q - q') + (r - r') = 0, or a(q - q') = r' - r. Since r' - r;;;' 0 and a > 
0, q - q' ;;;. o. Also, r' - r ~ r' < a, so a( q - q') < a, so q - q' < 1. Since 
q - q' is an integer, we must have q - q' = 0, and q = q'. Hence also 
r' - r = a(q - q') = 0, and r' = r. That completes the proof of uniqueness, 
and of the division theorem.

We proved the existence part of the division theorem by well-ordering 
in Chapter 2. 
Here is some terminology about integers: Say that a divides b, if b = aq 
for some irlteger q. We shall write alb if a divides b. For example, 6 divides 
12, 6 doesn't divide 15. If a and b are integers, a common divisor of a and b 
is an integer e such that e divides a and e divides b. A number d is the 
greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of a and b if: (i) dla and dlb; and (ii) if e is 
a common divisor of a and b, then e ~ d. Finally, a and b are relatively 
prime if their greatest common divisor is 1. Denote the greatest common 
divisor of a and b by (a, b). 
EXAMPLES. (25,35) = 5; (25, 17) = 1; (-16, - 32) = 16. 
Note. There can be only one greatest common divisor. 
The solution of the problem of finding the greatest common divisor of 
two natural numbers was given by Euclid. It works as follows. Suppose the 
two numbers are a and b, with b ~ a. (The next two paragraphs are 
paraphrased from Euclid (300 B.C.).) 

A Euclid's Algorithm 
21 
If b divides a, b is a common divisor of b and a, and it is manifestly also the 
greatest; for no number greater than b will divide b. But if b does not divide 
a, then, the lesser of the numbers a, b being continually subtracted from the 
greater, some number will be left which will divide the one before it. 
This number which is left is the greatest common divisor of b and a, and 
any common divisor of b and a divides the greatest common divisor of band 
a. 
We illustrate Euclid's method with 18 and 7. We subtract 7 from 18, to 
get 11 and 7. We subtract 7 from 11, to get 7 and 4. We subtract 4 from 7, 
to get 4 and 3. We subtract 3 from 4, to get 1 and 3. Now 1 divides 3, so 1 
is the number which is left which divides the one before it, and 1 is the 
greatest common divisor of 18 and 7. 
Or consider 78 and 32. Subtract 32 from 78, to get 46 and 32. Subtract 
32 from 46, to get 14 and 32. Subtract 14 from 32, to get 14 and 18. 
Subtract 14 from 18, to get 4 and 14. Subtract 4 from 14, to get 10 and 4. 
Subtract 4 from 10, to get 4 and 6. Subtract 4 from 6, to get 2 and 4. Now 
2 divides 4, so 2 is the greatest common divisor of 78 and 32. 
We can describe the algorithm somewhat more compactly by using the 
division theorem. Thus for the second example we have: 
78 = 32 . 2 + 14, 
32 = 14·2 + 4, 
14 = 4·3 + 2, 
4 = 2·2 + O. 
It is easy to see that 2 is the greatest common divisor of 32 and 78. But we 
can argue systematically as follows: First, 2 divides 4, hence divides 
4·3 + 2 = 14, hence 14·2 + 4 = 32, hence 32·2 + 14 = 78. So 2 is a com-
mon divisor of 32 and 78. Second, if d is a common divisor of 78 and 32, d 
divides 14 (from the first equation), hence 14 and 32, hence 4 (from the 
second equation), hence 4 and 14, hence 2 (from the third equation). So d 
divides 2. 
In mathematical symbols, here is 
Euclid's algorithm. Given natural numbers a and b, apply the division 
theorem successively as follows: 
a = bq + ro 
(dividing b into a), 
b = roqo + r l 
(dividing ro into b), 
ro = r1ql + r2 
(dividing r l into ro), 
r l = r2q2 + r3 
(etc.), 
rn- 2 = qn-Irn-I + rn, 
rn-I = qnrn + O. 
Then rn is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

then the first, etc., alternately, until one player is able to subtract a multiple 
of the lesser number from the greater to get 0, and then he wins. For example, 
the moves might start with (I8, 7):

(Hint: Use induction.) 
B. Greatest Common Divisors 
We observed that the last nonzero remainder in Euclid's algorithm applied 
to a and b is the greatest common divisor of a and b. Thus finding the 
greatest common divisor is an effective computational process. Euclid's 
algorithm also has the following useful consequence sometimes called 
Bezout's Identity. If the greatest common divisor of a and b is d, then 
d = ax + by for some integers x and y. 

B Greatest Common Divisors

Before we show how this is done, hide the rest of this page and try the 
numbers 365 and 1876. It is easy to see they are relatively prime (365 = 5 . 
73 and neither 5 nor 73 divides 1876). Try to write 1 = 365x + 1876y for 
some integers x and y. 
It is not obvious how to do this! 
Here is how. Do the Euclidean algorithm: 
1876 = 365 . 5 + 51, 
365 = 51 . 7 + 8, 
51 = 8·6 + 3, 
8=3·2+2, 
3 = 2· 1 + 1; 
so 1 is the greatest common divisor. 
Now solve for the remainders (the remainders are in boldface to 
distinguish them from the quotients) 
1 = 3 - 2· 1, 
2=8-3·2, 
3 = 51 - 8·6, 
8 = 365 - 51 . 7, 
51 = 1876 - 365 . 5, 
and successively substitute the remainders into the equation 1 = 3 - 2· 1, 
starting with 2: 
1=3-2 
= 3 - (8 - 3 . 2) = 3 . 3 - 8 
= 3(51 - 8·6) - 8 = 3 . 51 - 8· 19 
= 3 ·51 - 19(365 - 51·7) = 136·51 - 19·365 
= 136(1876 - 5·365) - 19·365 = 136· 1876 - 699 . 365. 
So x = - 699,y = 136. 
Another, easier, way to write d = (a, b) as d = ax + by is to keep track 
of how to write each successive remainder in Euclid's algorithm in terms of 
a and b, using the following layout illustrated with 1876 and 365. The first 
column consists of numbers obtained as remainders in Euclid's algorithm, 
together with a and b; the second column describes the coefficient x of 
365; and the third column describes the coefficienty of 1876, when writing 
the number in the first column in terms of 365 and 1876.

Therefore, 1 = - 699 . 365 + 136· 1876. 
Here is a more formal proof of the last assertion of Euclid's algorithm 
and of Bezout's identity using induction (1). 
Theorem. If rN is the last nonzero remainder in Euclid's algorithm for a and 
b, then rN is the greatest common divisor of a and band rN = ax + by for 
some x,y. 
PROOF. If rN is the last nonzero remainder in Euclid's algorithm for a and 
b, then the number of steps in the algorithm is N + 1. 
We shall prove the theorem by induction on N. If N = 0, then a divides 
b, and the theorem is trivial. If N = 1, then Euclid's algorithm for a and b 
has the form: 
b = aql + r l, 
a = r l q2 + o. 
Then it is easy to see that rl is the greatest common divisor of a and b; also 
rl = b· 1 + a· (- ql), so Bezout's identity holds. 
Assume the theorem is true for N = n - 1, so that the theorem is true 
for any two numbers whose Euclid's algorithm takes n steps. Suppose 

B Greatest Common Divisors 
25 
Euclid's algorithm takes n + 1 steps for a and b. If b = aq) + r), then the 
rest of the algorithm for a and b is Euclid's algorithm for r) and a. So 
Euclid's algorithm takes n steps for r) and a. If rn is the last nonzero 
remainder for Euclid's algorithm applied to a and b, it is the last J;lonzero 
remainder for Euclid's algorithm applied to r) and a. By induction, rn is the 
greatest common divisor of a and r), and rn = au + r)v. Now b = aq) + r), 
so it is very easy to see that rn' the greatest common divisor of a and r), is 
also the greatest common divisor of band a. Moreover, substituting for r) 
in the expression rn = au + r)v yields rn = au + v(b - aq) = a(u - vq) + 
bv. So Bezout's identity holds. The theorem is true by induction (1).

You have no doubt factored many numbers into products of primes. 
For example, 
368 = 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 23, 
369 = 3·3 ·41, 
370 = 2 . 5 . 37, 
371 = 53·7, 
372 = 2 . 2 . 3 . 31, 
373 = 373 
(a prime number), 
374 = 2· 11 . 17. 
The proof was given in Chapter 2 as an example of induction. 
We are going to prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, namely, 
that factorization of a natural number into a product of primes is unique. 
What does "unique" mean? 
Suppose a is a natural number. If a = PI ... Pn and a = ql ... qm are 
factorizations of a into products of primes, we shall say that the factoriza-
tions are the same if the set of p;'s is the same as the set of f/j's (including 
repetitions). That is, m = n and each prime occurs exactly as many times 
among the p;'s as it occurs among the f/j's. Thus we consider the factoriza-
tions 2· 2 . 3 . 31 and 3· 2 . 31 . 2 as being the same, because each prime 
occurs an equal number of times in each; whereas 2 . 3 . 3 . 31 and 2 . 3 . 2 . 
31 are different. Factorization of a is unique if any two factorizations of a 
are the same. 
Theorem. Any natural number ~ 2 factors uniquely into a product of primes. 
PROOF BY INDUCTION (2). Suppose that the result is true for all numbers 
less than a. Suppose a = PI ... Pn and a = ql ... qm are two factoriza-
tions of a. We want to show that the two factorizations are the same. 
Suppose it is true that PI = f/j for some j. Then a/PI = P2 ... Pn = 
ql ... f/j-lqj+1 ... qm' Since a/PI <a, by the induction assumption the 
two factorizations of a/PI are the same. That is, the set of primes 
{P2' ... ,Pn} is the same as the set of primes {ql' ... , qj-I' qj+ I' •.• , qm}' 

C Unique Factorization 
27 
Bu t since PI = llj, the set of primes {p I' P2' . . . , P n} is then the same as the 
set of primes {ql' ... , llj_I' llj, qj+ I> ••• , qm}, so the two factorizations of 
a are the same, and the result is true for the number a. That would prove 
the theorem by induction (2). 
We prove that if PI ... Pn = ql ... qm then PI = qi for some i by 
means of the following important 
Lemma 1. If P is a prime and P divides ab, then P divides a or P divides b. 
PROOF. Let d = (p, a). If d > 1 then d = P since P is a prime. In this case, 
pia. If d = 1, by Bezout's identity we can write 
l=ax+py 
for some integers x andy. Then b = bax + bpy. Now P divides ab and also 
divides p. So P divides bax + bpy = b, completing the proof of the lemma. 
o 
From the lemma it follows by induction (Exercise E32) that if a prime 
divides a product of m numbers it must divide one of the factors. To 
complete the proof of uniqueness of factorization, suppose we have 
PIP2 ... Pn = ql ... qm' Then PI divides ql ... qm' Since PI is prime, PI 
must divide one of the q's, say qi' Since qi is prime, qi is divisible only by 
itself and 1. Since PI =1= 1, PI = qi' 
Thus the induction argument described above for proving uniqueness of 
factorization can always be used, and the proof of uniqueness of factoriza-
tion is complete.

The argument of Lemma 1 can be used to prove 
Lemma 2. Suppose a, b, c are natural numbers> 1 such that a divides bc. If 
the greatest common divisor of a and b is I, then a divides c. 
E23. Prove Lemma 2. 
E24. Give six counterexamples to the assertion: If a divides be and a does not 
divide b, then a divides e. 
The problem of factoring a natural number n into a product of primes is 
much harder in practice than the problem of finding the greatest common 
divisor of two numbers. One needs to find divisors of n, and that is a 
matter of trial and error. For example, to factor 3372, we first see that 2 is 
a divisor: 3372 = 2 . 1686. Then we look for a divisor of 1686: 1686 = 2 . 
843, so 3372 = 2·2·843. Then we see that 3 divides 843: 843 = 3·281, so 
3372 = 2 . 2 . 3 . 2~ 1. Finally, we check that 281 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 
II or 13, and 17 > V28T , so 281 must be prime by exercise E25, and we 
have the factorization of 3372. 
There are obvious tricks for testing a number n to see whether it is 
divisible by 2, 3, or 5; we shall see later (Chapter 6) tests for 7, 11 and 13. 

28 
3 Unique Factorization into Products of Primes 
In general, however, unless n happens to be prime it is a slow process 
looking for divisors. So much so that it is claimed that if one had a 
126-digit number N which happened to be the product of two unknown 
63-digit prime numbers, and one wished to factor N, even using the best 
available (in 1977) methods and computers it would take about 40 X 1015 
years. By comparison, finding the greatest common divisor of two 126-digit 
numbers would take seconds. 
For a discussion of techniques for factoring composite numbers, see 
Knuth (1969, pp. 338-360). Some of the classical tricks are in Ore (1948). 
E25. Prove that if n is not prime, n has a prime divisor < Vii . 
E26. One can write down all primes < n for any given n by the simple device, 
called the sieve of Eratosthenes, of writing down all the numbers < n except 1, 
then circling 2 and crossing out all proper multiples of 2, then circling the 
first untouched number remaining and crossing out all proper multiples of 
that number, then circling the first untouched number remaining and crossing 
out all proper multiples of that number, etc., until there are no untouched 
numbers < Vii . All of the circled or untouched numbers < n will be prime. 
Try this with n = 100. Why can you stop once you have touched all numbers 
<Vii? 
D.Exponential Notation; Least Common Multiples 
Here is a convenient way of representing the prime factorization of a 
natural number n; we illustrate first with some examples. 
144 = 2432, 
975 = 3 . 5213 = 2°31527°11°131, 
1000 = 2353 = 233°53. 
We write a natural number n as a product of powers of primes, in 
increasing order. We can include extra primes which do not divide n by 
writing the exponent as 0: 
Uniqueness of factorization says there is only one way to do this, except 
for the inclusion of extra primes with exponent zero. 
Using this notation we can interpret some of our previous ideas. Let 
m = pf'Pf2 ... Pr\ 
where PI' ... 'Pr includes all primes which divide either morn and some 
of the exponents may be zero.

A. Euclid 
The last chapter showed that primes are the building blocks of natural 
numbers, in the sense that any number is a product of primes. For this 
reason mathematicians throughout history have been fascinated by primes. 
In this chapter we shall describe a few of the most famous results on 
primes. 
The earliest result on primes, due to Euclid, is from Book IX, Proposi-
tion 20 of The Elements (300 B.C.). 
Theorem. There are infinitely many primes. 
PROOF OF EUCLID. Suppose you believe that PI' ... ,PN are all the primes. 
I shall show that you are wrong. Consider the number PIP2 ... PN + 1. If 
it is prime, it is a new prime. Otherwise it has a prime factor q. If q were 
one of the primes Pi' then q would divideplP2' .. PN' and since q divides 
PIP2' .. PN + 1, q would divide the difference of these numbers, namely 1, 
which is impossible. So q can not be one of the Pi' and must therefore be a 
new prime. This completes the proof.

El. Use the ideas in Euclid's proof to try to prove that there are infinitely many 
primes of the form 4n + 3. (Hint: Consider 4PI ... Pn + 3.) 
E2. Try the same for numbers of the form 6n + 5. 
*E3. Try the same for numbers of the form 4n + 1, using (2Pl ... Pnf + l. 
In connection with these exercises we note a famous theorem of Dirichlet, 
which says that given any natural numbers a ;;. 2 and b with (a, b) = 1, there 
are infinitely many primes of the form an + b. We give a brief introduction to 
some of the ideas which go into the proof of that theorem in Section B.

B. Some Analytic Results 
This section assumes some knowledge of calculus and of infinite series. It 
and the following section may be omitted without loss of continuity. 
Euler provided a proof of the existence of infinitely many primes which 
provides the starting point for much advanced number theory. It uses the 
fact that the series 
diverges, that is, 
E 
lim L.!. = 00.

PROOF OF EULER. As in Euclid's proof, we assume that there are only 
finitely many primes, and we derive a contradiction. 
If PI' ••• ,PN are all the primes, then the product 
N g ( 
1 - /1/ Pi) ) 
is finite. Recall the geometric series: If 0 <x < 1, then

Now since PI' ... ,PN are assumed to be all the primes, and any natural

n = PI' ... p!t for some el ... eN' uniquely. So the right-hlind sum of (1) 
is the sum of all reciprocals 1 I n such that no prime occurs in the prime 
factorization of n to an exponent greater than E. In particular, if n ..;; E,

Euler's proof provides a starting point for a proof of Dirichlet's theorem 
that given any a, b with (a, b) = 1 there are infinitely many primes in the 
arithmetic progression an + b. 
The proof of Dirichlet's theorem begins with the interesting observation, 
which we shall justify momentarily, that the infinite series 
L 1.. 
p prime P 
diverges. One wants to show that if Pb is the set of primes of the form 
an + b, then 
diverges. This of course would mean that Ph is an infinite set. To do that 
one shows that in fact the ratio 
L

approaches 1/cf>(a) as n~oo, where cf>(a) is the number of natural numbers 
< a which are relatively prime to a. Since the denominator diverges, that 
would imply that the numerator would also diverge. For example, cf>(4) = 2, 
so that

Thus the proof of Dirichlet's theorem would show in particular, that not

but in some sense the number of primes of the form 4m + I is "the same" 
as the number of prime of the form 4m + 3.

c. The Prime Number Theorem 
We conclude this chapter by mentioning without proof two other famous 
results about primes. The first concerns the function '1T(x), defined to be 
the number of primes ~ x. 
Euclid's theorem (Section A) says that as x~oo, '1T(x)~oo. A much 
more precise result, called the prime number theorem, says: 
lim 
'1T(x) 
= 1. 
x-'>oo (x/log x) 
This means that given any e > 0 there is some number N such that for any 
x>N,

or

That is, while '1T(x) and x/log x may differ by a large amount, if x is 
chosen large enough, that difference can be made as small a percentage of 
x flog x as you wish. Thus the number of primes "x can be estimated 
rather well, no matter how large x is. 
A more elementary result, which still shows how closely '1T(x) and 
x/log x are related, is:

A comprehensible proof of this last result may be found in Niven and 
Zuckerman (1972, p. 184). 
Three fairly accessible articles about the prime number theorem are 
those of Levinson (1969), Goldstein (1973), and Zagier (1977). 
The second famous result about primes we mention concerns the gaps 
between consecutive primes. Exercise E6 showed that for any n, there is a 
prime P with n " P < (n - I)! + 2. There is a much better result: 
Bertrand's postulate. For any n > 1 there is a prime P with n " p < 2n. 
One consequence of Bertrand's postulate is that if PI = 2, P2 = 3, 
P3' ... are the primes in increasing order, then Pn+ I " 2Pn + I. 
A proof of Bertrand's postulate may be found in Niven and Zuckerman 
(1972, p. 189). 
E8. Prove the consequence of Bertrand's postulate just described. 
E9. If p" P2, . .. are the primes in increasing order, prove that Pn+ I <; PI + P2

Bases 5 
A. Numbers in Base a 
Our way of writing numbers is biased in favor of the number 10. When we 
take a number b, like b = MCMLXXVI, and write it as b = 1976, we mean 
that 
b = 1 X 1<P + 9 X 1()2 + 7 X 10 + 6; 
we call this way of writing b the representation of b in base 10, or radix 10. 
If we write a number b as a sum of powers of a (a ~ 2), 
b = rnan + rn_Ian- I.+ ... + rIa + ro, 
with each of ro, ... , rn between 0 and a-I, this is the representation of b 
in base (or radix) a. 
There is no particular reason except convention or physiology why we 
have a bias towards 10. For example, we could write b = MCMLXXVI in 
base 2: 
b = 1 X 210 + 1 X 29 + 1 X 28 + 1 X 27 + 1 X 25 + 1 X 24 + 1 X 23, 
or b = 11110111000. If we used base 2 with all numbers, our favorite 
electronic computer, which understands "on" (1) and "off" (0) very well, 
would be very happy and effiCient. 
Numbers themselves have no bias, as the following theorem shows. 
Theorem. Fix a natural number a ~ 2. We may represent any integer b ~ 0 
in base a: that is, b can be written uniquely as 
b = rnan + rn_Ian- 1 + ... +r2a2 + rIa + ro 
with 0 ~ rj < a for all i. 

38 
5 Bases 
If we write b in base a we shall use the notation b = (rnrn_1 ... r2r lrO)a. 
Thus (1976)10 = (11110111000)2. We shall omit ( )10 in decimal notation 
when there is no possibility of confusion. 
Here is a proof of the theorem, using induction (2). 
PROOF. Suppose all numbers < b may be written in base a. If a is the base, 
then divide a into b, using the division theorem to get b = aq + ro, 
0< ro < a. By induction, q = r l + ar2 + a2r3 + ... + an-Irn for unique 
integers r l , ••• , rn , 0 < ri < a. Then 
where 0 < ri < a for all i = 0, ... , n. The expression is unique because q 
and ro are unique in the division theorem. This completes the proof. 
0 
Notice that the proof shows how to get b in base a: we divide first b, 
then successive quotients, by a, 
b = aq + ro 
q = aql + r l 
ql = aqz + r2 
. , 
until the last quotient is O. The digits are the remainders: b = (rnrn _ 1 ••• 
r2r lrO)a· 
Here is an example. To get 366 in base 2: 
so 366 = (1011011IOh. 
366 = 2 . 183 + 0, 
183 = 2·91 + 1, 
91 = 2·45 + 1, 
45 = 2·22 + 1, 
22 = 2· 11 + 0, 
11 = 2· 5 + 1, 
5 = 2·2 + 1, 
2 = 2· 1 + 0, 
1 = 2·0 + 1, 
The ancient Babylonians used a base 60 number system. To get 13056 
in base 60: 
13056 = 60·217 + 36, 
217 = 60· 3 + 37, 
so 13056 = 3 . 60Z + 37 . 60 + 36 = (3, 37, 36)60.

We can add, subtract, multiply, and divide in any base. For example, 
multiplication in any base is done the way you learned in base 10 in grade 
school. The only change is that to use base a you must know the

error. For example, dividing 37 into 3071: does 37 go into 307 8 times or 9 
times? You have to check. In base 2, however, all the guess work is

a cube root algorithm is manageable?

C. Multiple Precision Long Division 
An important situation where representing numbers in a large base num-
ber is necessary is in doing highly accurate computations on a computer. 
A typical computer is set up to take and work with numbers of a certain 
size, for example, base 2 numbers with up to 32 digits. To do precise 
computation with numbers bigger than 232, one has to represent the 
numbers in the computation in base 232, and write a program telling the 
computer how to add, subtract, multiply and divide such numbers, assum-
ing that the computer has already been designed to do those operations to 
the digits of the base 232 numbers (the digits being base 2 numbers with at 
most 32 binary digits.) 
It is not hard to tell the computer how to add, subtract and multiply in 
any base, even in base 232, as we have observed in Section B. But what 
about division? In base 232 isn't the guessing horrendous? 
It turns out not to be so. 
Long division in base b is a sequence of divisions by a number d, the 
divisor, into numbers e where d < e < bd. The digit of the quotient corre-
sponding to the division of d into e is the greatest integer q such that 
dq<e. 
For example, in base 10, consider

32)8994 
64 
259

5 Bases 
We have d = 32, b = 10. In doing this long division, we first divide 32 into 
89 with quotient digit 2, then divide 32 into 259 with quotient digit 8, then 
divide 32 into 34 with quotient digit 1. Where we guess is in trying to 
determine these successive quotient digits. The guessing thus arises in the 
situation: Divide d into e with d ..; e < bd. 
In base b the standard guess is made as follows. First write d and e in 
base b: 
d = dnb n + dn_1b n- 1 + ... + d1b + do 
with 0 ..; d; < b, dn =1= 0, 
e = en+1b n+1 + enb n + ... + e1b + eo 
with 0 ..; e; < b. 
The standard guess is to divide dn , the largest digit of d, into the two-digit 
number en+lb + en' and use the quotient as the guess. So we define our 
estimate q' of the correct quotient digit q by: 
set q' = b - 1 
ifdn -
n+I' 
{ - e 
>en + l , 
set q' = the largest integer such that q'dn ..; en+ lb + en. 
(1) 
EIO. Show that in either case, q' .;; b - 1 and q'dn .;; en+ Ib + en. 
To illustrate in base 10, with q' the guess as defined by (1) and q the 
correct quotient (and n = 1): 
If d= 59, e = 500, dn = en + l , so q' = 9. Here q = 8. 
If d = 59, e = 400, 5 . 8 = 40, so q' = 8. Here q = 6. 
If d = 19, e = 100, dn = en + l , so q' = 9. Here q = 5. 
If d = 19, e = 90, 1 ·9 = 9, so q' = 9. Here q = 4. 
In all of these cases the guess q' is too big. But observe that q' is not as 
bad a guess for d = 59 as it is for d = 19. This will be true in general, as the 
following theorem shows. 
Theorem. Let d = (dndn - I ... dldo)b' e = (en+ len· .. eleoh (where dn =1= 0 
but en + I may be 0), and suppose d..; e < bd. Suppose q' is the guess as 
defined in (1) above. Let q be the correct quotient, that is, the largest integer 
with qd..; e. Then: 
(i) q' > q-the guess q' is always > the correct quotient q; 
(ii) if dn > b /2, then q > q' - 2-the guess q' is equal either to q, to q + 1, or 
to q + 2. 
PROOF. (i) Since qd .;;; e, we have 
q(dnbn + dn_Ib n- 1 + ... + d1b + do) 
"e 
bn+1 + e b n + e 
bn- l + ... + e b + e)

So 
qdnb n ..;; en+1b n+1 + enbn + en_1bn- 1 + ... + e1bl + eo = e. 
Since en_Ibn-I + ... + e1b + eo <bn, 
e < en+1b n+1 + enb n + bn = (en+lb + en + l)b n. 
Therefore qdnbn < (en+1b + en + l)b n, so 
qdn < en+1b + en + 1. 
Since both sides are integers, therefore 
qdn ..;; en+1b + en· 
It follows that q";; q'. For q ..;; b -
1, since qd";; e < bd, if dn > en+l , then 
q'dn is defined to be the largest multiple of dn which is ..;; en+ Ib + en' so 
q ..;; q'. That proves (i). 
To prove (ii), suppose dn ~ b /2. By choice of q it suffices to show that 
(q' - 2)d ..;; e. Now 
(q' - 2)d = (q' - 2)(dnbn + dn_1bn- 1 + ... + d1b + do). 
(2) 
Since dn_1b n- 1 + ... + d1b + do < bn, we get from (2) that 
(q' - 2)d < (q' - 2)(dn + l)bn = [q' dn + (q' - 2 - 2dn) Jb n 
(3) 
by Exercise EIO. Now dn ~ b/2 and q' ..;; b - 1, so q' - 2 - 2dn < O. Hence 
the right-hand side of (3) is 
..;; (ben+l + en)bn 
..;; (ben + I + en)b n + en_1b n- 1 + ... + e1b + eo = e, 
proving part (ii).

The theorem shows that in any base b, if the leading digit of the divisor 
is ~ b/2, the standard guess q' will never be off by more than 2: either q', 
q' - 1, or q' - 2 will be the correct quotient. Notice that it does not matter 
how large the base b is. 
To insure that the leading digit of the divisor is ~ b /2, one "normal-
izes." Take the original divisor d and dividend e and multiply d and e by 2s 
where 2S is the largest power of 2 with 2Sd < bn+ I. Then divide 2sd into 2se. 
If e = qd + r, then (2Se) = (2Sd)q + ro where '0 = 2s,. So normalizing by 
multiplying d and e by 2S does not change the resulting quotient, and the 
remainder will be 2S times the remainder on dividing e by d. 
It is therefore quite feasible to tell a computer how to do multiple 
precision long division. You can tell it first to normalize, then you can tell 
it what to guess, and it will have no difficulty adjusting its guess by I or 2 
if necessary to obtain the correct quotient at each stage in the long division 
process.

One moral of the theorem: In dividing using long division, the larger the 
first digit of the divisor is, the easier the division is. So, in base 10,

is easier than 
17)7135. 
Did you know that before?

D. Decimal Expansions 
We can do expansions in base a also. In base 10 they are called decimal 
expansions. To begin with an example, to expand 1/7 into a decimal, 
divide 7 into 1 by the division algorithm, multiply the remainder (which is 
1) by 10, divide that by 7 (with quotient 1), multiply the remainder (which 
is 3) by 10, divide that by 7 (with quotient 4), etc. It is what you do in long 
division:

If we want the base a expansion of b / c and b and c are expressed in

as B = 131420) there exist infinitely many primes P whose decimal repre-
sentation includes B (for example, if B = 37, then 37, 137, and 373 are three 
such primes for B). 

Congruences 6 
A. Definition of Congruence 
An arithmetic progression is a sequence of integers of the form nk + a, 
k = ... , - 2, - 1, 0, 1, 2, .... We write the set of all integers in such 
a progression as {nk + ahEZ' Example: the progression ... , -7, 
- 2,3,8, 13, 18, ... forms the set {Sk + 3hEZ' 
We encountered arithmetic progressions in the chapter on primes. For 
example, we showed that there were infinitely many primes of the form 
4k + 3, that is, primes which when divided by 4 leave· a remainder of 3. 
Dirichlet's theorem (Chapter 4, Sections A and B) asserts the existence of 
infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression of the form nk + a, 
k = 0, 1, 2, . .. ,when n and a are relatively prime. 
Congruence is a very convenient notation for describing whether two 
numbers are in the same arithmetic progression. The notation is due to 
Gauss. 
Definition. Two integers a and b are congruent modulo n, written 
a == b (mod n), 
if b = a + (some multiple of n). 
This definition is equivalent to each of the following. 
(a) n divides a-b. 
(b) b is in the arithmetic progression 
... , - 3n + a, - 2n + a, - n + a, a, n + a, 2n + a, 3n + a, ... 
( c) The set {nk + a} k E Z is the same as the set {nk + b} k a· 

48 
If a and b are natural numbers, it is also equivalent to: 
(d) a and b leave the same remainder when divided by n. 
6 Congruences 
El. Prove that each of (a)-(d) (condition (d) when a and b are natural numbers) is 
equivalent to the condition that b = a + (multiple of n). 
Here are some numerical examples of congruences: 
1325 == 2 (mod 9), 
182 == 119 (mod 9), 
3 == - 1 (mod 4), 
13 == 0 (mod 13), 
26 == 13 (mod 13). 
You should check that these really are congruences. 
E2. Find the smallest number;;;, 0 congruent to a (mod m) where a and mare 
(i) 3312 (mod 4), 
(ii) 177 (mod 8), 
(iii) 31 (mod 37), 
(iv) III (mod 109). 
B. Basic Properties 
The congruence symbol looks like an equality, and this is no accident. In 
fact, one can view congruence geometrically as a kind of equality. Take the 
real number line and lay on it a circle of circumference n. Then wind the 
real number line around the circle. The picture shows n = 6. 
17,11,5 
3,9,15 
-3 
-6 
0,6,12,18 
1,7,13,19 
Integers which lie over the same point on the circle are congruent mod n; 
integers lying over different points are not. 
Most of the things you normally can do with an equality you can do 
with congruence mod n. In particular, congruence satisfies these funda-

C Divisibility Tricks 
mental properties: 
(i) if a =.b (mod n) then ka =.kb (mod n); 
(ii) if a =.b (mod n) and b =.c (mod n), then a =.c (mod n); 
(iii) if a =. b (mod n) and a' =. b' (mod n), then 
(iiia) a + a' =.b + b' (mod n), and 
(iiim) aa' =.bb' (mod n). 
49 
All of these follow easily from the condition that a =.b (mod n) if a = b + 
nq for some integer q. We prove (ii) and (iiim): 
PROOF OF (ii). if a =.b (mod n) and b =.c (mod n), then a = b + sn, b = c 
+ tn for some integers sand t. Substituting, we get a = (c + In) + sn = c + 
(multiple of n), so a =. c (mod n). 
D 
PROOF OF (iiim). if a =.b (mod n) and a' =.b' (mod n), then a = b + sn, 
a' = b' + tn for some integers sand t. Then aa' = bb' + nsb' + tbn + stn2 = 
bb' + (multiple of n). So aa' =.bb' (mod n). 
D 
E3. Prove (i) and (iiia). 
Property (iiim) shows particularly well the virtue of the congruence 
notation. If we translate a =. b (mod n) and a' =. b' (mod n) into divisibil-
ity notation, they read: n divides a - band n divides a' - b'. To conclude 
that n divides aa' - bb' is less natural than to conclude from a =.b 
(mod n) and a' =.b' (mod n) that aa' =.bb' (mod n). 
The one thing which can be done with ordinary equality which cannot 
be done in general with congruences mod n is cancellation: If ab =.ac 
(mod n), it does not necessarily follow that b =. c (mod n). For example, 
2· 1 =. 2 . 3 (mod 4), but 1 ~ 3 (mod 4). Similarly 6 =. 12 (mod 6), but 1 ~ 
2 (mod 12). We shall postpone for now the rule which replaces the usual 
rule of cancellation. Meanwhile, you try to invent a useful rule of your 
own. Do examples. 
E4. Prove that 6· 4n == 6 (mod 9) for all n ;> o. 
E5. Prove that if n > 4 and n is not prime, then (n - I)! == 0 (mod n). 
C. Divisibility Tricks 
There is a very old trick to check addition and multiplication: sum the 
digits and do the operation on the sums of the digits. For example, 
multiplication: 
3325 
182 
605150 
3 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 13, 
1 + 8 + 2 = 11, 
6 + 0 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 0 = 17, 
1+3=4 
1+1=2 
1+7=8 
? 

50 
6 Congruences 
If the multiplication on the sums of the digits does not equal the sum of 
the digits of the answer, the multiplication was done incorrectly. (If the 
multiplication on the sums of the digits does equal the sum of the digits of 
the answer, the answer may still be wrong, but is likely to be correct if the 
person multiplying is fairly reliable.) 
This trick is called "casting out 9's." You are really looking at re-
mainders upon division by 9 when you look at the sums of the digits: 
3325 = 9a + 4 and 182 = 9b + 2, so 3325· 182 = 9(9ab + 4b + 2a) + 8 = 9c 
+ 8 for some integers a, b, c. If you compute 3325·182 and get an answer 
whose remainder when divided by 9 is =1= 8, the answer must be wrong. 
Here is why it works: For any n > 0, 
10" - I = (999 ... 9)\0 
(n times) 
= 9 . (Ill ... 1)\0 
(n times), 
so 10" = I + (multiple of 9). Multiplying by any number a gives a· 10" = a 
+ (multiple of 9). Thus 
3325 = 3 . HY + 3 . lQ2 + 2 . IO + 5 = 3 + 3 + 2 + 5 + (multiples of 9). 
So 3325 differs from the sum of its digits by a multiple of 9. 
Using the notation and properties of congruence mod n we can con-
veniently describe some tests for deciding when a number expressed in 
base IO is divisible by a certain number. (Recall from Chapter 1 that "iff' 
means "if and only if.") 
Leta=(anan_I ·· . a1ao)\O= an 10" + an_110"-1 + ... +ao' 
Fact. 9 divides a if 9 divides the sum of its digits. 
PROOF. We just did this. We redo it using congruence notation. Since 
10' == 1 (mod 9) for all r > 0, it follows from the properties (i)-(iii) of 
congruence that 
a = an 10" + ... +a11O + ao == an + an-I + ... +ao (mod 9). 
That is, a is congruent mod 9 to the sum of its digits. Thus 9 divides a iff 
a == 0 (mod 9) iff an + an-I + ... + ao == 0 (mod 9) iff 9 divides the sum 
of the digits of a. 
D 
Fact. 3 divides a if 3 divides the sum of its digits. 
PROOF. Since 9 divides 10' - 1, so does 3. So the proof is the same as for 9. 
Fact. 2 (resp. 5) divides a if 2 (resp. 5) divides ao. 
PROOF. 10' == 0 (mod 2) and 10' == 0 (mod 5) for 
(mod 2) and a == ao (mod 5). 
D 
all r> 1. So a ==ao 
D 
Fact. 11 divides a if 11 divides ao - al + a2 - ... +( -Iran'

D. More Properties of Congruence 
The properties (i)-(iii) show that congruence to a fixed modulus m is much 
like equality, except for cancelling; in this section we list properties which 
relate congruences to different moduli, and describe how to cancel. 
(iv) If a ==b (mod m) and d divides m, then a ==b (mod d). 
We already used this property in discussing the divisibility test for 7, 11, 
and 13, for we observed that if a ==b (mod 1(01) then a ==b (mod 7) since 
7 divides 1001. 
(v) If a ==b (mod r) and a ==b (mod s), then a ==b (mod [r, s]). 
Thus if a ==b (mod 7) and a ==b (mod II) and a ==b (mod 13), then a ==b 
(mod [7, 11, 13]), that is, a ==b (mod 1(01). 
The cancellation properties of congruences are summed up by the 
following. Here r =t= O. 
(vi) If ra ==rb (mod m) then 
a == b (mOd (r,mm))' 
For example, 4·3 == 4·8 (mod 10), so 
3 == 8 (mOd (1~~ 4) ). 
that is, 3 == 8 (mod 5). 

52 
Two special cases are when rim or when (m, r) = 1: 
(vii) If ra =.rb (mod rm), then a =.b (mod m). 
Congruences 
PROOF. if ra =.rb (mod rm), then ra - rb = rme for some e; cancelling r 
gives a - b = me, so a =.b (mod m). 
0 
(viii) If ra =.rb (mod m) and (r, m) = 1, then a =.b (mod m). 
Thus, if 2 . r =. 2 . s (mod 11), we may conclude that r =. s (mod 11) since 
(2, 11) = 1. 
Proofs of all these results are exercises.

E16. Prove: For x,y > 1, if x =.y (mod m), then (m, x) = (m,y). 
E. Congruence Problems 
We begin considering the problem of solving congruences containing 
unknowns. 
The simplest such congruences are 
(a) x + e =.d (mod m), and 
(f3) ax==-b (modm). 
Congruence (a) is trivial to solve: add - e to both sides to get x ==-d - e 
(mod m). 
Congruence (f3) is already interesting. Here are some examples to try: 
(i) lOx ==- 14 (mod 15); 
(ii) lOx ==- 14 (mod 18); 
(iii) lOx ==- 14 (mod 21). 
The first of these is not solvable. For if it were, there would exist 
integers x and y such that lOx + l5y = 14. Since 5 divides lOx + l5y for 
any x and y, but 5 does not divide 14, no such x and y can exist. 

E Congruence Problems 
53 
The second congruence is solvable. Using property (viii) above with 
r=2, we get 
(iii) 5x == 7 (mod 9). 
By trial and error we get x = 5 as a solution. 
The third congruence is solvable. Since (10, 21) = 1 we can find integers 
u, v with 1 = lOu + 21v by Bezout's identity (or by inspection: v = 1, 
u= -2). Then 
lOu == 1 (mod 21) 
so 
10 . 14u == 14 (mod 21) 
and x = 14u is a solution. Bezout's identity would work also for con-
gruence (ii) since we can solve lOu + 18v = 2 and 14 is divisible by 2. 
E17. Decide whether each of the following congruences has a solution. If so, find 
the least nonnegative solution: 
(a) 12x == 7 (mod 21); 
(b) 12x == 7 (mod 84); 
(c) 12x == 7 (mod 73); 
(d) 12x == 7 (mod 46); 
(e) 12x == 7 (mod 35). 
E18. Prove: ax ==b (mod m) has a solution iff b is divisible by (a, m). 
E19. How many solutions x of ax == b (mod m) are there with 0 < x < m? 
ElO. Solve 18x == 1 (mod 25). 
Ell. Solve 12x == 33 (mod 57). 
When trying to solve quadratic congruences, that is, congruences of the 
form 
ax2 + bx + c == 0 (modm), 
(I) 
already the theory becomes very subtle. The simplest case is 
x 2 == a (mod m). 
(2) 
The general case (1) reduces to the form (2) by multiplying everything by 
4a: 
4a2x 2 + 4abx + 4ac == 0 (mod 4am) 
or 
{2ax + b)2 == b2 - 4ac (mod 4am), 
which is of the form (2).

Gauss (1801) was the first to give a complete treatment of the solution 
of (1), by means of his famous law of quadratic reciprocity. We will 
examine this law in Chapter III-16.

F. Round Robin Tournaments 
Congruences can be applied to the design of round robin tournaments. We 
need the following easily proved 
Lemma. For any integer a and n (n ;;;. 2), there is a unique x with 1 .;;:; x.;;:; n 
such that x == a (mod n). 
E26. Prove this, paying special attention to the case a < 0, and to uniqueness. 
Suppose we have n players, labeled 1, 2, 3, ... , n, where n is even. If 
there are an odd number of players, then add a "bye," an extra, vacuous 
player, to make an even number. Each player is to play all n - 1 other 
players, so there are n - 1 rounds. For round r the opponent for player 
xo' Xo < n, is given by the rule: Xo plays y if y is the (unique) solution, 
I .;;:; y .;;:; n - 1, of the congruence y ==r -
Xo (mod n - 1) provided Xo =;by. 
If the congruence y ==r -
Xo (mod n - 1) is solved by y = Xo, so that 
2xo == r (mod n - 1), then Xo plays n. Player n plays x in round r if x is the 
unique solution, I .;;:; x.;;:; n - 1, of the equation 2x ==r (mod n - 1). 
E27. If n is even, show that for each r there is exactly one solution of 2x == r

Congruence Classes 
There is a way of interpreting divisibility and congruences which leads to 
the invention of new "number" systems. 
The new systems we invent consist of things we shall call congruence 
classes. Each congruence class is a set consisting of an arithmetic progres-
sion, hence each congruence class contains infinitely many integers. 
We begin with a simple example of such a number system; we shall call 
it 7L2• It consists of two elements, two congruence classes, which we shall 
call [Oh and [lh: 
[OL = { ... ,-4, - 2,0,2,4,6, ... }, 
the even integers, 
and 
[I]2 = { ... , - 3, - 1, 1, 3, 5, ... }, 
the odd integers. 
Thus [Oh is the set of integers in the arithmetic progression 2k + 0, 
k = ... - 2, - 1,0, 1, 2, ... , and [lh is the set of integers in the progres-
sion 2k + 1, k = ... - 2, - 1, 0, 1, .... Any two elements of [Oh (or of 
[l h) are congruent mod 2, and no element of [Oh is congruent to any 
element of [lh mod 2. 
We define arithmetic operations with [Oh and [lh by recalling that: 
even integer + odd integer = odd integer; 
odd integer + odd integer = even integer; 
even integer + even integer = even integer; 
even integer· even integer = even integer; 
even integer' odd integer = even integer; 
odd integer· odd integer = odd integer. 

7 Congruence Classes 
57 
Thus we define addition and multiplication in 7L2 = {[Oh, [lh} according to 
the following table. 
+ 
[Oh

[lh 
That is, 
[Oh + [lh = [lh, 
[Oh' [lh = [Oh, 
[lh + [1h = lOb 
[lh' [1h = [112; 
These equations give the sum or product of any two elements of 7L2, in 
such a way that 7L2 satisfies the formal properties required of something 
called a field. (Examples of fields which you already know are the rational 
numbers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers.) We shall define a 
field in the next chapter. 
Another example of congruence classes arises with time. If you get to 
work at 9 o'clock and work 8 hours, the time when you stop working is 5 
o'clock. Thus 9 + 8 = 5 on the clock. This addition makes sense because a 
clock divides time into congruence classes. Two hours t I and t2 read the 
same on the clock iff t I and t2 differ by a multiple of 12 hours iff t I =. t2 
(mod 12). The congruence class mod 12 of the time to consists of all times t 
so that the clock reads the same at to as it does at t. 
In particular, if you go to work 9 hours after midnight arid work 8 
hours, you quit 17 hours after midnight. The clock reads the same 17 hours 
after midnight as it does 5 hours after midnight. So if we denote the 
congruence class of t by [tl I2, then [9 + 8112 = [5h2' 
Now we describe congruence classes in general. 
Pick and fix a natural number m :> 2. 
We know that a == b (mod m) means b = a + (multiple of m). 
We define the congruence class of a (mod m), written [al m , to be the set 
of numbers of the form km + a. For all k, that is, [al m = {km + ahEZ' 
The picture in Chapter 6 in which we wrapped the real number line 
about a circle of circumference m gives a very good view of congruence 
classes: The congruence class mod m of the number a is the set of all 
integers which lie at the same point as a on the circle. 
From that picture it is clear that two congruence classes are either equal 
or disjoint (have no elements in common). 
The congruence classes [al m and [bl m are equal exactly when a =.b 
(mod m). This is obvious from the picture in Chapter 6. It can be proved 
using property (ii), Section 6B, as follows: Suppose a == b (mod m). If c is 
in [al m , then a ==c (mod m); since a =.b (mod m), then c =.b (mod m) by 
property (ii), Section 6B, so c is in [bl m • A similar argument shows that if c 

58 
7 Congruence Oasses 
is in [b]m' then c is in [a]m. On the other hand, if a i!E:b (mod m), then b is 
not in the congruence class of a, and so [a]m =1= [b]m. 
There are exactly m congruence classes mod m. This is obvious from the 
picture in Chapter 6. To prove it without a picture, note that every element 
of Z is congruent to one of the numbers 0, 1,2, ... , m - 2, m -1. You 
can see this for any a by the division theorem: If a = qm + r where 
0" r <m, then a =r (mod m), so [a]m = [r]m. So every congruence class 
mod m is equal to one of [O]m' [I]m, ... , [m - I]m. Since these classes are 
all different, there are exactly m classes mod m. 
For example, there are 2 congruence classes mod 2: [Oh, the congruence 
class consisting of the even integers, and [Ib the congruence class consist-
ing of the odd integers. There are 3 congruence classes mod 3, which we 
can call [Oh, [Ih, [2h: 
[0]3 = { ... ,-9, - 6, - 3,0,3,6,9, 12, ... ,99354, ... }; 
[1]3 = { ... ,-20, ... , -8, - 5, -2,I,4,7, ... 82, ... 93547, ... }; 
[2]3 = { ... ,-334, ... , - 1, 2, 5, ... ,811211, ... }.

.... 13.10.7.4.1~2.5.8.11.14 •... 
El. In which congruence class in l3 is 3124? -8337? 8391? 
In general we shall call the set of congruence classes mod m by Zm. 
Then 
Z2 = {[0]2' [I]2}' 
Z3 = {[0]3' [1]3' [2]J 
and, in general, 
Zm = {[O]m' [I]m' [2]m'···' [m-I]m}· 
Any element b of a congruence class [r]m is called a representative of the 
congruence class [r]m. If b is in a congruence class [r]m, then [r]m = [b]m: 
any representative of a congruence class completely determines the class, 
and a congruence class can be labeled by any representative. Thus [1]3 = 
[4h = [90Ih = [-8h. The tendency is to label a congruence class by its 
smallest positive or nonnegative representative. For example, a clock labels 
hours with the representatives 1, 2, 3, ... , 12. But one can do otherwise. 
Thus we could describe Z3 as {[3Oh, [ - 2h, [11 h} if we wished. 

7 Congruence Classes 
59 
It is common to abbreviate the notation by writing [a]m as a when it is 
clear we are working with elements of 7Lm , i.e., "mod m." This abbreviation 
yields statements which would be absurd if a were taken as an integer, not 
as an integer mod m or as the representative of a congruence class in 7Lm • 
For example, the statement about the integers I and 3, 
I = 3, 
is absurd, but 
[1 L = [3]2 
is true, so as an abbreviation for this last equality 
1=3 
is true. We shall usually give explicit warnings when we are using 
abbreviated notation for congruence classes. 
In 7L2 above we defined addition and multiplication. We do the same for 
7Lm , in the most natural way possible: If a and b are integers, 
[a]m +[b]m =[a+b]m' 
- [ a]m = [ - a ]m' 
[ a] m • [ b] m = [ a· b] m· 
We shall show shortly that these operations defined on congruence 
classes make sense. First, here is how + and . work for some examples. 
We did 7L2 above.

7 Congruence Classes 
We define the operations in?Lm by [a]m + [b]m = [a + b]m' [a]m' [b]m = 
[a·b]m, -[a]m = [-a]m' Notice that the operations seem to depend on the 
representatives used to label the congruence classes of ?Lm • In fact, they do 
not. 
We have to show that if we label congruence classes by different 
representatives it will not affect the outcome of addition, negation, or 
multiplication. That is, 
if [alm = [a']m and [b]m = [b']m, then [a + b]m = [a' + b']m' [- b]m = 
[-b']m' and [a·b]m = [a' ·b']m' 
(Think about this with odd and even integers and m = 2.) To prove these 
facts, we translate into congruence notation. The first becomes 
if a =.a' (mod m) and b =.b' (mod m), then a + a' -=-b + b' (mod m). 
This is property (iiia) of congruences. Similarly, if b =. b' (mod m) then 
- b =. - b' (mod m). This is property (i) of Section 6B with k = -
1. You 
try proving the assertion about multiplication: 
E4. Prove that if [alm = [a']m, [b]m = [b']m then [a· b]m = [a' . b']m' 
The classes [O]m and [l]m are a bit special, and satisfy 
[OJm +[bJm =[bJm forallb, 
[OJm . [b Jm = [OJm 
for all b, 
[IJm·[bJm =[bJm forallb. 
They act just like 0 and 1 do in ?L, which is hardly surprising in view of 
how we defined addition and multiplication in ?Lm • 
Casting out 9's can be rephrased in the new symbolism using ~on­
gruence classes in ?L9: Let (anan- 1 ... a1aO)1O be a number expressed on 
ordinary base 10. Then using the definition of addition and multiplication 
of congruence classes, we have 
[(anan- 1·· .a1aO)lOJ9 =[anlon + an_1lon- 1 + ... +a l lO+aoJ9 
= [ an Ion J 9 + . . . + [ a 1 10 J 9 + [ ao J 9 
= [ an J 9 [ Ion J 9 + . . . + [ ad 9 [ 10 J 9 + [ ao J 9 
=[an J9[1J9+'" 
+[ad9[IJ9+[aoJ9 
= [ an J 9 + . . . + [ ad 9 + [ ao J 9 
= [ an + an - 1 + . . . + a 1 + ao J 9 
since [lon]9 = [1]9 for any n. Thus any number differs from the sum of its 
digits by a multiple of 9. 

7 Congruence Classes 
61 
We emphasize that == (mod m) for integers is the same as equality for 
congruence classes in 7Lm : that is why == (mod m) shares so many proper-
ties of equality. 
We conclude this chapter by observing that we now have several 
different notations for the same idea. Given integers a and b, and m > 1, a 
= b + (multiple of m) iff m divides b - a iff a ==b (mod m) iff [a]m = 
[b]m. The reason for introducing this last notation is that it enables us to 
conveniently introduce the new systems 7Lm of "numbers" which are quite 
analogous to the usual systems, like ~, and which we can work with in 
similar ways. The value of having these new systems available will, we 
hope, be made clear by some of the applications which we shall study later.

Rings and Fields 
A. Axioms 
In this chapter we describe a number of axioms for sets on which addition 
and multiplication are defined. These axioms were originally found by 
isolating the basic properties of addition and multiplication which are 
common to all or most of the examples we already know: 7L, Q, IR, C. A 
ring, a commutative ring, or a field will be defined as a set with addition 
and multiplication satisfying certain of the axioms. 
The value of these definitions is twofold. First, having the notion of 
field, for example, gives us a way of examining new sets with addition and 
multiplication. We shall ask: Is 7Lm a field? We shall look for other 
examples of fields. By the end of the book we shall have found a vast array 
of new fields. Second, since a commutative ring or a field shares, by 
definition, many of the properties of 7L, Q, IR, etc., examples we already 
know, then, if we find a new example of a field or a commutative ring, we 
shall know we can manipulate its elements in the same way we would 
manipulate numbers-rearranging sums, rearranging products, collecting 
common factors of sums, etc. In Chapter 9 we shall observe that much of 
the elementary linear algebra you may (or may not) have learned works 
when the scalars come from any commutative ring with identity, and in 
some later chapters, when we use linear algebra it will be with scalars in 
some of the new fields and rings we are about to discover. 
We begin with the most general concept. 
Definition. A ring (with identity) is a set R with three operations, +, " and 
- , and two special elements, 0 and 1, which satisfy the various properties 
listed below as axioms (i)-(vii). The operations + and . may each be 

A Axioms 
63 
thought of as functions from R X R (ordered pairs of elements of the set 
R) to R, so that for any pair (a, b), a, b in R, a + b is an element of R, and 
a· b is an element of R. The operation -
similarly is a function from R to 
R which takes a in R to - a in R. 
The set R, together with the operations +, . and -
and special 
elements 0, 1, is a ring with identity if the following axioms hold: 
(i) for any a, b, c in R, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) (associativity of addi-
tion); 
(ii) for any a, b, in R, a + b = b + a (commutativity of addition); 
(iii) for all a in R, a + 0 = a (0 is a zero element); 
(iv) for any a in R, a + ( - a) = 0 ( - a is the negative of a); 
(v) for any a, b, c in R, (a·b)·c=a·(b·c) (associativity ofmultiplica-
tion); 
(vi) for all a in R, a· 1 = 1 . a = a (l is an identity element). 
(vii) for any a, b, c in R, a· (b + c) = (a·b) + (a·c) and (a + b)·c = (a·c) 
+ (b· c) (distributive laws). 
These basic axioms are all satisfied by lL, Q, ~, C, lLm' and the set of 
n X n real matrices (see Section 9B). 
Some examples of sets which are not rings are: 
the set of natural numbers f'\J; 
the set of nonnegative real numbers ~+, with the usual + and·; 
the set lL - {3} of all integers except 3. 
The set lL - {3} is not a ring with respect to the usual addition and 
multiplication in lL for the reason that if a, b are in lL - {3} then a + b 
need not be in lL - {3}. For example, 1 + 2 = 3: 1 and 2 are in lL - {3} but 
3 is not. When this kind of thing occurs we say that lL - {3} is not closed 
under addition, by which we mean that lL - {3} is a subset of a bigger set, 
7L, on which addition and multiplication always makes sense, and if we 
take the sum in 7L of two elements of 7L - {3} the result in some cases is 
not in 7L - {3}. The notion of (not) closed under multiplication is similar. 
We now state some axioms which are satisfied by special types of rings. 
(viii) For all a, b in R, a· b = b· a (commutativity of multiplication). 
A ring (like 7L, Q, ~, C, 7Lm) which satisfies this axiom is called a 
commutative ring. 
(ix) For all a, b in R, if a· b = 0, then a = 0 or b = O. 
A ring satisfying this axiom is said to have no zero divisors. Examples are 
7L, Q, ~, C, and 7Lm for some but not all m. 
El. Give examples of ml> m2 > 6 so that 7Lm, has zero divisors and 7Lm2 does not. 

64 
8 Rings and Fields 
Definidon. An element a of a ring with identity R is called a unit of R if 
there exists some b in R with ab = ba = 1. 
EXAMPLES. In Z only 1 and - 1 are units. In 01 every nonzero rational 
number is a unit. 
If ab = ba = 1, b is unique (Exercise E4(ii» and is called the inverse of 
a; it is usually denoted by a-I. 
Here are the last two axioms. 
(x) Each a =1= 0 in R is a unit. 
(xi) 1 =1=0 in R. 
E2. Prove that if axiom (xi) does not hold in R, a ring with identity, then R must 
be a set with only one element. 
A commutative ring satisfying axioms (x) and (xi) is called a field. 
EXAMPLES. 01, IR, C are fields; Zm is for some but not all m. Z does not 
satisfy axiom (x) and so is not a field. 
E3. Show that a field has no zero divisors. 
E4. Show that in a commutative ring R: 
. 
(i) if a + b = d and a + c = d, then b = c; 
(ii) if a·b = b·a = 1 and a·c = I, then b = c; 
(iii) if a has an inverse in R, then there is a unique solution in R to the 
equation ax = d. 
ES. If m is odd, does [21m have an inverse in lm? 
E6. Determine which axioms hold and which fail for each of the nonrings N and 
R+ mentioned above. 
E7. Show that if R is a ring and a is any element of R, then a· 0 = O. 
ES. Let R be a ring with identity. Prove: 
(i) for all a, b in R, if a + b = 0, then b = - a; 
(ii) (-1)·(-1)= I; 
(iii) -(-a) = a for all a in R; 
(iv) for all a, b in R, (-a)·b = - (a· b). 
E9. For al band cl d rational numbers, say al b =cl d (mod I) if (al d) - (c I d) 
is an integer. Call the set of congruence classes mod I, Cil. 
(i) Show that every rational number is congruent (mod I) to a rational 
number alb with 0, a < b. 
(ii) Is Cil a commutative ring? a field? Check the axioms. 
EIO. Let 1R3 be the set of vectors in real 3-space with the usual addition (parallelo-
gram law) and with multiplication given by the cross or vector product. 
Which axioms for a ring hold and which do not for 1R3? 

65 
We now check these axioms on lLm. We shall write [a]m as [a] if we think 
no confusion will arise in doing so. 
Theorem. lLm is a commutative ring with unity for any m. 
We defined addition, multiplication, and subtraction in lLm by [a] + [b] 
= [a + b], - [a] = [- a], [a]· [b] = [a· b]. Set 1 = [1],0 = [0]. With these 
definitions it is easy to show that if lL is a commutative ring (which it is), 
then so is lLm• For example, the verification that the associativity law for 
multiplication holds goes as follows: for any a, b, c, it]. lL, [a]· ([b]· [cD = 
[a] . [b· c] = [a(b· c)] = [(a· b) . c] = [a· b]· [c] = ([a]· [b]) . [c]. 
Ell. Verify a distributive law. 
The only axioms which might not hold in lLm are the axioms (ix) (no 
zero divisors) and (x) (existence of multiplicative inverses). For example, 
check back to the multiplication tables for lL3 and lL4• If you do, you will 
see that lL3 is in fact a field, whereas in lL4 neither axiom holds because 
[2]4' [2]4 = O. 
Theorem. If m is not prime, lLm is not a field. 
PROOF. Write m = a·b with a, b <m. Then [a]m[b]m = [m]m = [O]m' but 
[a]m "1= [O]m' [b]m "1= [O]m' 
0 
Theorem. In lLm [a]m has an inverse if and only if the greatest common 
divisor of a and m is 1. 
PROOF. If [a]m has an inverse then there is some b in lL with [a]m' [b]m = 
[I]m' This means that a' b = 1 + r' m for some r, so the greatest common 
divisor of a and m is 1. On the other hand, if the greatest common divisor 
of a and m is 1, then we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find b, r in lL 
so that a' b + r' m = 1. Then in lLm' [a]m' [b]m = [I]m' so [b]m is the inverse 
of [a]m' 
0 
The point should be emphasized that if [a] has a inverse in lLm the 
Euclidean algorithm allows us to actually find it. 
EXAMPLES. In lL 13 , [9]-1 =? The Euclidean algorithm or some intuition 
reveals that 1 = 9 . 3 - 13 . 2, so [9]-1 = [3]. 
In lL14' [9]-1 =? Since 1 = 14·2 - 9·3, [1] = [9]· [-3], so [9r 1 = [-3] 
= [11].

8 Rings and Fields 
1beorem. lm is a field if and only if m is a prime. 
El3. Prove this. 
Using notions of congruence classes we redo an exercise about con-
gruence mod m: 
Proposition. Given a congruence ax =ay (mod m) one is free to cancel a 
and conclude x =Y (mod m) iff (a, m) = 1. 
PROOF. [ax]m = [ay]m iff [a]m[x - Y]m = o. We are allowed to cancel [a]m 
iff [a]m is not a zero divisor in lm. 
Claim. [a]m is a nonzero divisor in lm iff (a, m) = 1. 
PROOF. If (a, m) = I, then [a]m has an inverse in lm' [b]m. Then [a]m[r]m = 
[O]m implies [b]m[a]m[r]m = [r]m = [O]m' so [a]m is a nonzero divisor. Con-
versely, if (a,m)=d>l, then m=de, a=dfwith I <e,f<m. Then 
[a]m[e]m = [J]m[d]m[e]m = [J]m[m]m = 0 but [e]m:;6 O. So [a]m is a zero 
divisor. 
0 
Of course the complete story with respect to cancellation in congruences 
is: 
ax = ay (mod m) iff x = y (mod (a':m)). 
The proposition covers the case when (a, m) = 1. 
E14. How many solutions x are there of 6x == 6 (mod 18) with 0 .;;; x < 18?

E17. Find an element IX in I34 so that every invertible element of I34 is a power

E18. In the ring of 2 X 2 matrices with entries in Is, find the inverse of (i g). 
tE19. Here is a new example of a field. In I3' just as in R, one cannot solve the 
equation x 2 + 1 = O. So let i be a solution of x 2 + 1 = 0, and consider the set 
I3[i] of numbers a + bi with a, b in I3. (This field is also known as GF(9), 
which denotes "Galois field of 9 elements" -Galois was a famous French 
mathematician of the Napoleonic era.) Operate on elements of I3[i] as 
though they were complex numbers. (1) Write down all nine elements of 
I3[i]. (2) Show that every nonzero element of I3[i] has an inverse.

Matrices and Vectors 
This chapter is written to give a brief survey of those aspects of vectors and 
matrices which we wish to use elsewhere in the book. Except for Section B, 
which gives an example of a noncommutative ring, the chapter is intended 
as reference and not as an introduction to linear algebra. The rest of the 
book has been written so that those few places where linear algebra is used 
may be omitted without loss of continuity. However, linear algebra plays a 
central role in mathematics. So when you get to a place where some linear 
algebra is used, it is better that you not skip it but, rather, try to 
understand it, with the aid, if needed, of this chf!.pter or some introductory 
text in linear algebra. 
We assume R is some commutative ring, like Q, l, ln' or ~. 
A. Matrix Multiplication 
This section reviews the most basic properties of matrices. 
A column vector is a column of elements of R, viz., 
[:J 
A row vector is a row of elements of R, viz., (a), ••. , an)' 
An m x n matrix is a rectangular array of mn elements of R, viz., 
a l1

A Matrix Multiplication 
69 
which can be thought of as a collection of row vectors placed in a column, 
or as a collection of column vectors laid out in a row. When we say that a 
matrix is m X n, the first number, m, is the number of rows, the second, n, 
is the number of columns. 
Given a row vector with n elements (placed on the left) and a column 
vector with the same number of elements (placed on the right), we may 
multiply them to get an element of the ring R; 
(a" .. " ao)[ lJ- a,b, + a,b, + ... +aA 
Examples where R = 1. are: 
(325)[ -~] = 4, (123)[ J] = 0, (l2)(~) = 2. 
Given an m X n matrix A, we can multiply the matrix (placed on the 
left) with an n-element column vector X (placed on the right) by thinking 
of the matrix as a collection of m n-element row vectors and doing m 
multiplications of the row vectors of A with X. The result, AX, is a column 
of m elements:

right) we can multiply them by thinking of A as a collection of n-element 
rows and B as a collection of n-element columns. The result, AB, is an 
m X p matrix whose element in the ith row andjth column is obtained by 
multiplying the ith row of A and the jth column of B. Thus in the example

Note that the order in which the matrices are multiplied (Le., which 
matrix is on the left and which is on the right) is very important. In the last

vectors with differing numbers of elements. Even when it makes sense to

B. The Ring of n X n Matrices 
In this section we show that the set of square matrices of a given size 
satisfies many of the axioms introduced in Chapter 8. 
Let Mn(R) be the set of n X n (square) matrices. If A, B are in Mn(R), 
then A and B can be multiplied to get AB, another n x n matrix. Thus 
Mn(R) is closed under multiplication, in the sense that given any pair 
(A, B) of n x n matrices, their product AB is defined and in Mn(R). 
We can also define addition of vectors and matrices, first for column 
vectors,

vectors:

Note that A + B makes sense only if A and B have the same shape. In 
particular, if A, B are square n X n matrices, A + B is defined. 
Thus MiR) is a set with two operations, + and· . 
Theorem. If R is a commutative ring with identity, then Mi R) is a ring with 
identity. 
To prove this we have to check a number of axioms. We leave the 
checking as exercises. 
Those for addition follow almost immediately from the fact that R 
satisfies the same axioms.

The example concluding Section A shows that M 2(R) does not have a

We conclude this section by mentioning one other operation involving 
matrices, namely scalar multiplication. If A is a matrix of any size (in 
particular, a column or row vector) and s is an element of R, that is, a 
scalar, then define the matrix sA to be the matrix in which each element of 
A is multiplied by s. That is,

C Linear Equations 
73 
c. Linear Equations 
Matrices and vectors are a convenient way to describe systems of linear 
equations. 
Suppose given a system of m equations in n unknowns: 
allx j + a'2x2 + ... + ainxn = b" 
a2,x, + a22x2 + ... + a2nxn = b2, 
We call such a system homogeneous if b, = b2 = ... = bm = 0, and nonho-
mogeneous otherwise. 
We can make the two sides into column vectors and write the system as 
an equality of column vectors, 
[ 
allx, + ... + a'nXn 1 
am,x, + ... + amnXn 
= 
bm 
(1) 
because two column vectors are equal precisely when their respective 
components are equal. 
We can rewrite (I) in either of two ways. On the one hand we can use 
the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of column vectors 
(= m X 1 matrices) to write equation (1) as 
This says that to solve the original system is the same as to write the vector 
b, 
bm 
as a linear combination (i.e., a sum of scalar multiples) of the column 
vectors 

74 
9 Matrices and Vectors 
On the other hand, we can write down the m X n matrix whose columns 
are the vectors we just wrote down, and observe that the left side of (l) is 
the product of that matrix, called the matrix of coefficients of the original 
system, with a column vector of the x/s: 
If we set 
then the set of equations can be written in the form AX = B. 
ExAMPLE. The set of equations 
may be written 
or as 
3xI -
2X2 + X3 = 4, 
XI + X 2 -
X3 = 2, 
XI 
+ 3X3 = 1 
Suppose there were an n X m matrix C such that CA = I. If we could 
find such a C, then CB = CAX = IX = X would be a solution of the 
equations. Thus solving equations is closely related to finding inverses of 
matrices.

If A is an n X n (square) matrix, the determinant of A is defined and is an

defined as follows:

For nontriangular 4 X 4 or larger matrices the explicit formula for the 
determinant is too complicated to write down and will not be needed in 
this book. 
If A is an n X n matrix, sometimes A has an inverse, an n X n matrix B 
such that AB = BA = I. There is a theorem which says that such a B exists 
iff the determinant of A is an invertible element of R. In particular, for 
2 X 2 matrices, if the determinant of A is invertible, the inverse of A can be 
found as follows: When

as is easily checked. For A 3 X 3 or bigger, the formula for getting the 
inverse of A using determinants is too complicated to state here. We can 
find the inverse of A using row operations. 
E. Row Operations 
The material from linear algebra surveyed in the remainder of this chapter 
is somewhat less elementary than what has been discussed above. It will be 
needed only in a very few subsequent chapters, and should be referred to 
only when needed. The ideas presented may be found in most introductory 
textbooks on linear algebra, such as Zelinsky (1973). 
A most useful computational technique for matrices is the use of row 
operations, known also as Gaussian elimination. There are three such 
operations: 
(1) interchanging two rows of a matrix; 
(2) multiplying a row by an invertible scalar; 
(3) replacing a row by itself plus a multiple of another row. 
These correspond to things which can be done to sets of simultaneous 
equations without affecting the solutions of these equations. Using them, it 
is possible, if R is a field, to take an m X n matrix A and, by using 
operation (3) to introduce zero entries into the matrix, transform A into its 
row reduced echelon form. This is a matrix of the following forms, with 
"steps":

3x2 + 3X3 + 3x4 = 0, 
(l) 
the row operations done above would correspond to manipulations on the 
equations which would yield new equations having the same solutions as 
the original set. Thus the solution of equations (1) is the same as that of

The solutions to (2) are all obtained by assigning arbitrarily chosen 
values to X3 and X4• In fact, the vector of solutions can be written as 
[~il- [-~;I;:'X' -xfr;j + xrH 
(2') 
where X3 and X4 may be chosen at will. 
If we wish to solve a nonhomogeneous system of equations, one in the 
form AX = Y, with Y not a vector of all zeros, we can do row operations to 
the so-called augmented matrix. For example, suppose we wish to solve 
or 
2Xl + X2 + 4X3 = 2, 
Xl + 2X2 + 3X3 = 1, 
3xl -
3X2 + 3X3 =3,

This equation is the same as the equation (1) we just solved, except that we 
require that X 4 = - 1: 
[! j i !l [~:1 [U 
(3') 
Thus to solve AX = Y, where A is m X n, we take the m X (n + 1) matrix 
with A in the leftmost n columns and Y in the rightmost column, and 
reduce it to row reduced echelon form. If the resulting leftmost n columns 
are the m X n matrix E and the rightmost column is Z, then solving 
AX = Y is the same as solving EX = Z. Doing this with equation (3'), we 
get

Xl + 5/3x3 - 1 = 0, 
X2 + 2/3x3 = 0, 
0=0,

Sometimes we cannot solve the equation AX = Y. Here is an example. If

which are clearly unsolvable! 
In an equation of the form 
AX = Y, 
the variable Xi has as coefficients the entries in the ith column of A. When 
we reduce A to row reduced echelon form, certain columns contain steps 
and certain columns do not. The variables Xl' ••• ,xn then divide up into 
those corresponding to columns with steps, and those corresponding to the 
columns without steps. Reducing the matrix of coefficients of a set of 
equations to row reduced echelon form always gives instant solutions for 
the variables corresponding to the columns with steps, in terms of the other 
variables. 
We can find the inverse of an n X n matrix A, if it exists, by solving for 
X in the equation 
AX = Y = IY or (A, 1)( _~) = 0,

9 Matrices and Vectors 
where (A, I) is the n x 2n matrix whose left side is A and whose right side 
is the n x n identity matrix I, and where X, Y are column vectors of 
unknowns. If the row reduced echelon form for the n X 2n matrix (A, I) is 
in the form (I, B), that is, if the leftmost n columns of the row reduced 
echelon form of the n X 2n matrix (A, I) form the n X n identity matrix I, 
then 
(A, 1)( _ ~) = 0 iff (I, B)( _ ~) = 0 iff X = BY 
iff B is the inverse of A. So write, side by side, (A, I), and do row 
operations on the whole matrix to try to reduce A to I. If this succeeds, 
then by the same operations 1 becomes transformed into the inverse of A.

For F a field, denote by Fn the set of all column vectors with n entries 
from F. Thus F2 = {(~)} where a, b are elements of F. The set F n of all 
n-element column vectors ("n-tuples") has operations of addition and 

F Subspaces, Bases, Dimension 
81 
scalar multiplication as follows: 
these operations make F n into what is called a vector space. 
A subset S of Fn is called a subspace if whenever X, Y are in S, so is any 
linear combination, that is, so is rX + sY for any r, s in F. 
The relevant examples of subspaces in this work are null spaces and row 
spaces of m X n matrices. 
Let A be an m X n matrix. The null space of A is the set S of all X in pn 
such that AX = O. If we interpret A as a matrix of coefficients of a set of 
homogeneous equations, then the null space of A is the set of solutions to 
the corresponding set of equations. The set S is a subspace of Fn. For if 
X, Yare solutions, so is any linear combination: If r, s are any elements of 
F, then 
A(rX + sY) = r(AX) + s(AY) = rO + sO = O. 
(On the other hand, the set of X such that AX = B, for fixed B =1= 0, is not a 
subspace, for if AX = B, then A(X + X) = 2B, not B.) 
A basis of a vector space S is a set Xl' ... , Xr of vectors in S such that 
any vector WinS can be wtitten as a linear combination of Xl' ... , Xr in 
exactly one way. This condition can be described as a combination of two 
conditions. We say that a set Xl' ... , Xr of vectors of S spans S if any 
vector in S can be written as a linear combination of Xl' ... , Xr (perhaps 
in many ways), and we say that Xl' ... , Xr are linearly independent if the 
only solution to the equation 
ClX1 + C2X2 + ... + crXr = 0 
is the solution C1 = 0, C2 = 0, ... , Cr = o. Then a basis of S is a set of 
linearly independent vectors which spans S. It is not hard to see that this 
last description of basis is equivalent to the first. 
Here are some examples of bases. 
In F2, a basis is (~) and (n. For given any vector (~) in F2, we can 
write 
and it is very easy to see that (~) and (n are linearly independent. 
If N is the null space of the matrix of coefficients of the set of equations 
(1) of the last section, then the vectors in N are described by (2') as 

82 
9 Matrices and Vectors 
arbitrary linear combinations of 
Thus 
span the null space N, and since those two vectors are linearly indepen-
dent, they are a basis of the null space N. 
In general, to find a basis of the null space N of an m X n matrix A, 
solve AX = 0 by putting A into row reduced echelon form. Then as in 
equation (2') of Section E, spreading out the resulting solution vector 
describes the solutions as linear combinations of a basis of N. 
A space S generally has many different bases. But it is a theorem that 
all bases of a space S contain the same number of vectors. The dimension 
of a space is equal to the number of vectors in any basis of the space. Thus 
the dimension of F n is n, and the dimension of the space N of solutions to 
(1), Section E, is 2. 
The row space of an m X n matrix A is the set of all n-tuples (row 
vectors) which are linear combinations of the rows of A. It is not hard to 
see that if you do a row operation to A, the row space of the new matrix is 
the same as the row space of A. Thus, since the row reduced echelon form 
E of A is obtained by a sequence of row operations, the row space of E is 
the same as the row space of A. 
For example, if A is the matrix of coefficients of the equations (1) of the 
last section, then the row space is the set of vectors of the form 
X = al (2 I 4 2) + ail 2 3 I) + a3(3 -3 3 3), 
where aI' a2' a3 are arbitrary scalars. Any such vector X can be written as a 
linear combination of the vectors in the row reduced echelon form of A. In 
fact, the vector X may be written 
X = (2a l +a2+3a3)(1 0 t I) + (a l +2a2-3a3)(0 ItO). 
Conversely, if 
is a typical vector in the row space of the echelon form E, then 
Y = ObI -tb2)(2 1 4 2) + ObI +tb2)(1 2 3 1) + 0(3 -3 3 3), 
so is in the row space of A. Thus the row spaces of A and of E are the 
same. 

F Subspaces, Bases, Dimension 
83 
It is easy to check that the nonzero rows of the row reduced echelon 
form of a matrix A are a basis of the row space of A. Thus the number of 
nonzero rows in the row reduced echelon form of A is the dimension of the 
row space of A That dimension is called the (row) rank of A. 
It is a theorem that for A an m X n matrix, the rank of A + the 
dimension of the null space of A = the number of columns of A. If you 
interpret the rank as the number of columns with steps in the row reduced 
echelon form of A, and the dimension of the null space as the number of 
columns without steps, the theorem becomes very reasonable.

Secret Codes, I 
This chapter may be omitted without loss of continuity. 
One interesting use of lLn is in designing ciphers, or codes designed to 
preserve the secrecy of messages being communicated. In this chapter, we 
describe a way of creating ciphers based on the use of matrices with entries 
in lL26• This approach is based on an article by Hill (1931) that is now 
somewhat dated, but still provides interesting practice in doing arithmetic 
mod n. (See Chapter 15 for a more up-to-date example of ciphers.) 
We shall assume some of the facts about matrices and vectors reviewed 
in Sections A, C, and D of Chapter 9. 
The messages we start with will be in English, so the first step is to 
change letters into numbers. 
We let the letters of the alphabet correspond 1-1 with the integers from 
1 to 26, which we view as representatives of the congruence classes in lL26 : 
if a is an integer, we shall write [ah as a in this section. Thus all algebraic 
operations on integers will be mod 26. We can correspond letters to 
elements of lL26 in any way we wish; for simplicity we shall use the 
following.

Since lL26 is a commutative ring we can form column vectors of elements 
of lL26 and n X n matrices with entries in lL26, and we can multiply vectors 
by matrices and multiply matrices of appropriate sizes. We can even 
sometimes find the inverse of an n X n matrix: we note the useful fact 
(Chapter 9D) that an n X n matrix A with entries in a commutative ring R 
has an inverse B with entries in R (so that AB = BA = In) if and only if the 
determinant of A has an inverse in R. 

10 Secret Codes, I 
85 
The ciphers we can form involve matrices of various sizes. We shall 
illustrate several different sizes by coding and decoding the message: 
AITACKXATXDA WN 
where we put the X into separate words. We write the message as a 
sequence of elements of 71.26 using the correspondence (1) 
1, 20, 20, 1, 3, 11,24, 1,20,24,4, 1,23, 14 
or which is easier (since we're thinking of these numbers as representing 
classes in 71.2J, 
1, -6, -6, 1,3, 11, -2, 1, -6, -2,4, 1, -3, 14. 
(2) 
Codes of size 1 x 1 
Here is how we code. Take an invertible element of 71.26, such as 5: 5 . (- 5) 
== 1. Multiply each number in the message (2) by 5 (mod 26): we get 
5, -30, -30,5, 15,55, -10,5, -30, -10,20,5, -15, 70 
or, choosing different representatives (mod 26), 
5, 22, 22, 5, 15, 3, 16, 5, 22, 16, 20, 5, 11, 18. 
(3) 
Using the correspondence (1) to change back to letters, we get 
EWEOCPEVPTEKR. 
The receiver decodes by translating the received message using (1) back 
into numbers, getting (3), and multiplying each number of (3) by - 5 
(mod 26). Since - 5 . 5 == I (mod 26), the receiver ends up with the 
sequence of numbers corresponding to the original message. 
El. Encode and decode 
HAPPYXBIRTHDAY 
using this 1 X 1 code. 
This code is pretty easy to crack, if messages of some length are sent. 
Since each letter, such as A (or T), always corresponds to the same letter in 
code, here E (or V), cryptanalysts can note letter frequencies in the code, 
and, using known information about frequencies of occurrences of letters 
in English tests, decipher the message without knowing the code. This is 
sufficiently easy to do that I x I coded messages are given as puzzles in 
some magazines. 
So we shall try to make mOre complicated codes. 
Codes of size 2 X 2 
Break the enumerated message as in (2) up into a sequence of 2-tuples: 
To code, multiply each vector in (4) by some invertible 2 X 2 matrix A.

Notice that now A in the original message is replaced by H, V, or X, 
depending on its location in the original message. Now, only pairs of 
letters are set to the same thing, and then only if they both begin at an 
odd, or both at an even location in the message. 
The receiver would take the coded message, put it back into a sequence 
of 2-tuples (5), and multiply each 2-tuple by A -I. Since A -I·A = I, she will 
end up with the original set of 2-tuples (4) and finally, using (1), the 
original message. 
EXAMPLE 2. We could use a matrix like 
A = (~ -3) 
I ' 
whose determinant is 11, an invertible element of 7L26• Then 
A-I = (=~ 
l~)' 
Applying this matrix A to the 2-tuples (4), the coded message will then be 
TWKIYTSUTFEMDE, 
which can be deciphered using A - I. 
How did we get A -I? recall that if D = ad - be is invertible, DE = 1, 
then 
(~ b)-I = ( 
dE 
d 
-eE -bE). 
aE 
In 7L26, if A=(~ -i), D=det(A)=2+9= 11. Now 11 has an inverse 
(mod 26) since 11 and 26 are relatively prime; using the Euclidean algo-
rithm or Euler's theorem (Chapter 12) we get 11· 19 == 1 (mod 26), and 
E = 19. So

Twisted codes

If even more security is desired, add a twist: Use a matrix A which has 
entries which are functions of a variable t, but whose determinant is an 
invertible constant in 1:26, so that the inverse of A can be found for any t. 
Then vary t by some rule, such as t = n if the nth "tuple" is being coded 
(or decoded). 
For example, in the 2 x 2 case, we could use 
with inverse

A-I = (18 + t

2+3t q - I 
whose determinant is 3 for any 1 in 1:26 and so whose inverse can be found.

Another possible strategy is to use nonsquare matrices. If A is an m X n 
matrix, m > n, sometimes there is an n X m matrix B with BA = I. For 
example:

So we could encode A IT ACKXA TXDA WN by multiplying the 2-tuples 
(-!)( -~ )Ci), 
etc., by 
A =[i H 
to get

If we did this we would be sending redundant information, and that 
might be useful, for example, if the radio signal being used to send the 
messages were full of static. We shall consider that problem later! 
ES. Complete the encoding of AITACKXATXDAWN. Check your answer by 
decoding the result. 
There is nothing special about 7L26 in all we have done. We might prefer 
to add three symbols to our alphabet and formulate all our secret codes in 
7L29, a field. Then we could use (1) to translate from letters to elements of 
7L29, and let 27,28,29 denote ".", "?" and "-" (space). So "attack at dawn" 
is set up as AITACK-AT-DAWN.-, and numerically as 
1, 20, 20, 1, 3, 11, 29, 1, 20, 29, 4, 1, 23, 14, 27, 29. 
E9. Do Example 2 (2 X 2 case) with the same matrix A, except think of A as having 
entries in 1.29, and illustrate the example by encoding and decoding the

Fermat's Theorem, I: 
Abelian Groups 
A. Fermat's Theorem 
A famous and important theorem of number theory due to Fermat (c. 
1640) gives, among other uses, a different way to find the inverse of a 
nonzero element of 71.P' p prime. We have already seen how to find the 
inverse of [a]p by solving ax + py = I, using Euclid's algorithm and Be-
zout's identity. 
Fermat's theorem. If p is a prime and a is an integer not divisible by p, then 
aP - 1 == I (modp). 
D 
As an example, notice that the corollary is true in 71.7• In that case, 
p - 2 = 5: 
IS = I, 
25 = 32 == 4 (mod 7), 
35 = 243 == 5 (mod 7), 
45 = (- 3)5 == - 5 == 2 (mod 7), 
55 = (- 2)5 == - 4 == 3 (mod 7), 
65 = (_1)5 == - I = 6 (mod 7), 
El. Verify the corollary in 1:11•

and2·4== I (mod 7) 
and 5 . 3 == I (mod 7) 
and 6 . 6 == - 1 . - 1 = I (mod 7). 
The following proof of Fermat's theorem goes back at least to 1803. 

B Abelian Groups 
91 
PROOF. Let a be a number relatively prime to p. We want to show that 
[aP-l]p = [l]p. Let l; be the set {[I]p, [2]p' ... ,[p -I]p} consisting of all 
the invertible elements of lp. Consider the set 
V = {[ a]p' [2a]p' [3a]p' ... , [(p - I)a]p}' 
We observe that V is the same as the set l;. For since a and p are 
relatively prime, there is some integer b with [b]p[a]p = [I]p' If [m]p is in 
l;, [m]p = [(mb)a]p' which is in V. Thus the set l; is a subset of the set V. 
But V has at most p - 1 distinct elements in it, while l; has exactly p - 1 
elements which are all distinct. So l; must be all of V. 
It follows that when we take the product of all the elements of l; it is 
the same as the product of all the elements of V. Thus 
[1·2·3·· 'p-I]p =[a·2a·3a··· (p-I)a]p' 
(The right side is the product of the elements of V.) There are p - 1 factors 
of a in the right side. Collecting them together, we get 
[(p - I)!]p = [aP- 1. (p - I)!]p = [aP-1]p' [(p -I)! ]p' 
Now (p - I)! is relatively prime to p (why?) so we can cancel [(p - I)!]p to 
get 
[I ] p = [ aP- 1 ] P 
so that aP- 1 == 1 (modp). That completes the proof. 
D 
We shall give an entirely different proof of Fermat's theorem in Chapter 
11-10. 
El. Prove that if a and b are relatively prime integers, and a and e are relatively 
prime, then a and be are relatively prime. 
E3. Show that if p is prime, thenp is relatively prime to (p - I)!. 
E4. Show that n5 and n have the same last digit (in base 10). 
ES. Show: If 7 does not divide n then 7 divides n 12 -

E7. Show that n5/5 + n3/3 + 7n/15 is an integer for any n. 
ES. Prove that for any integer n, n9 + 2n 7 + 3n3 + 2n is divisible by 5. 
B. Abelian Groups 
The proof we gave of Fermat's theorem in Section A depends on the fact 
that the set l; of nonzero elements of lp forms an abelian group, which 
we now define. 

92 
11 Fermat's Theorem, I: Abelian Groups 
Definition. A group G is a set {a, b, c, ... , e} together with an operation 
* (so that for any a, binG, a * b is an element of G), which satisfies the 
following three axioms: 
(i) (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all a, b, c in G (associativity); 
(ii) there is an element e in G (the identity) such that for all a in G, 
a * e = e * a = a; 
(iii) for each a in G, there is some b in G (the inverse of a) such that 
a * b = b * a = e. 
The group G is abelian if 
(iv) for all a, b in G, a * b = b * a (commutativity). 
E9. Prove that in a group G, the cancellation law holds: if a * b = a * c, then 
b= c. 
Here are some examples of groups: 
(1) any ring R, where the operation * is + and e = 0; 
(2) the set of all elements except 0 in a field F, where the operation * is . 
and e = 1; 
(3) all [r]m in 7Lm with r relatively prime to m, where the operation * is " 
and e = [l]m; 
(4) all real numbers > 0, where the operation * is . and e = 1; 
(5) the real numbers 1 and - 1, where the operation * is . and e = 1; 
(6) all complex numbers on the unit circle in the complex plane, where the 
operation * is . and e = 1; 
(7) any vector space V, where the operation * is addition of vectors and e 
is the zero vector; 
(8) the set of all invertible n X n real matrices, where the operation * is 
multiplication and e = In' the n x n identity matrix; 
(9) the set of all n x n real matrices with determinant = 1, with the 
operation * being multiplication and e = In' 
All but the last two examples are abelian groups. 
Fermat's theorem as we have proved it is really a theorem about abelian 
groups. We show that by sketching an abstraction of our proof of Fermat's 
theorem. Here it is: 
Abstract Fermat Theorem. If an abelian group G consists of n elements, then 
for any a in G, a * a * a * . " * a = e (where a appears n times on the left 
side). 
SKETCH OF PROOF. Let aI' a2' ... ,an be the elements of G. Then a * aI' 
a * a2, ... , a * an are n elements of G which are all distinct, for if 
a * aj = a * aj> then aj = aj by cancellation (Exercise E9). Thus the set 
{a l • a2"'" an} is the same as the set {a * al • a * a2"'" a * an}' 

B Abelian Groups 
93 
To complete the proof along the lines of Fermat's theorem we need two 
consequences of the axioms: 
(i') Generalized associativity. If A is a group, so that a(bc) = (ab)c for any 
a, b, c in A, then for any n ;> 3 all possible ways of associating the 
product of any n elements of A are equal. 
For example, with n = 5, 
(a(bc»(de) = ((ab)(cd»e = (a(b(c(de»» = ... 
This consequence means that when we see a product abcde we are free 
to associate it in any way. The resulting product will not depend on how 
we did it. For this reason we can without confusion omit parentheses 
entirely. 
(iv') Generalized commutativity. If A is an abelian group, so that ab = ba 
for any a, b in A, then for any n ;> 2 all possible ways of mUltiplying n 
elements of A, regardless of order, give the same result. 
For example, abcde = ebcda = acedb = . .. (where we have omitted 
parentheses by assuming generalized associativity). 
The proofs of both (i') and (iv') can be done by induction: see Exercises 
Ell and E12. 
These two facts permit the manipulations in the remainder of the proof 
of the abstract Fermat theorem. 
Since the set {aI' ... , an} is the same as the set {a * aI' ... , a * an}, 
the products of all the elements in the two sets are the same (by gener-
alized commutativity): 
a I * a2 * a3 * . .. * an = a * a I * a * a2 * . .. * a * an 
(where we are allowed to ignore parentheses by generalized associativity). 
We rearrange the right side: 
(a * a * ... * a) * aI * a2 * ... * an 
(where we are allowed to rearrange by commutativity). By cancellation 
e = a * a * . .. * a 
(n times), 
which was to be proved.

by induction on the number of parentheses to the left of al in the product u, 
and assuming that the result is true for any product of n - 1 elements. 
c. Euler's Theorem 
Euler's theorem is a generalization of Fermat's theorem obtained by 
applying the abstract theorem to Example (3) for any m: 
Euler's theorem. Let G be the set of units of 71.m , that is, the set of congruence 
classes in 71.m represented by natural numbers m which are relatively prime to 
m. If cp(m) is the number of elements in G, then [a<l>(m») = [1). 
E13. Prove that G is closed under multiplication. 
In congruence notation Euler's theorem reads: 
If (a, m) = 1, then a<l>(m) == 1 (mod m). 
EXAMPLE. In 71.26, G consists of [a) where a = 1,3,5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19,21, 
23, and 25. Thus cp(26) = 12. So 312 == 1 (mod 26), 1112 == 1 (mod 26), etc. 
Of course, to apply Euler's theorem one must know cp(m), the number of 
natural numbers < m which are relatively prime to m. The function cp is 
called Euler's phi function. If m can be factored, then cp(m) can be 
computed by use of the following facts, which you can try to prove: 
*E14. Prove that 
(a) </>(p) = p - 1 if p is prime, 
(b) </>(pn) = pn - pn-I for p a prime, 
(c) if a and b are relatively prime, </>(ab) = </>(a)</>Cb). What then is </>(8772)? 
Euler's theorem gives an alternate way to find the inverse of an 
invertible element of 71.m • If [a) is invertible in 71.m , that is, (a, m) = 1, then 
[arl = [a<l>(m)-I).

D Finding High Powers mod m 
95 
D. Finding High Powers mod m 
The use of Fermat's and Euler's theorems is facilitated by the following 
base 2 trick. We will demonstrate it by looking at the problem of finding 
n 100 (mod m). 
Begin by writing 100, the exponent, in base 2: 100 = 64 + 32 + 4 = 
(1100100)2. This is a seven-digit base 2 number, so write down 7 - 1 = 6 
copies of S: 
S S S S S S. 
Think of the six copies of S as separators of the digits of (1100100). Insert 
X wherever the digit is 1, leave blank (or put a dot) when the digit is O. We 
get 
XSXS.S.SXS.S. or XSXSSSXSS. 
Now, starting with the number 1, view X and S, from left to right, as the 
following operations: X means multiply by n and reduce mod m; S means 
square and reduce mod m. 
If we do not reduce mod m at each step, we get: 
xs

n12~ n24 ~n25 ~ 
n50~ nlOO. 
If we do :·educe mod m at each step, then after each step we get a number 
m which is congruent mod m to the corresponding power. 
For example, we do 12100 (mod 34), n = 12, m = 34.

Thus 12100 = 30 (mod 34). 

96 
11 Fermat's Theorem, I: Abelian Groups 
This process is based on the way one gets 100 in base 2: successively 
divide 100 by 2, just as in Russian peasant arithmetic (Chapter 2, Exercise 
E9)-
100 = 50·2, 
50 = 25·2, 
25 = 12·2 + 1, 
12 = 6·2, 
6 = 3·2, 
3 = 1 ·2+ 1, 
1=0·2+1. 
We know that the remainders, reading from bottom to top, are the 
digits, from left to right, in the representation of 100 in base 2. But each of 
these equations tells how to get the successive powers of n, starting with nO: 
for example, given n 12, n25 = n I2.2+1 = (n J2i'n: to get n25, square n l2 and 
then multiply by n.

E22. Find a number r < 41 such that 12r == 1 (mod 41). 
E. The Order of an Element 
We know that in Z26' [11]12 = [1] by Euler's theorem. What other powers of 
[1 I] can equal [1]? The following two results describe the possibilities. 
Let G be an abelian group with n elements. For a in G write a' a ... a 
(m times) as am; aO = e, the identity of G. The usual laws of exponents 
apply. For a in G let S = {m > IJa m = e}. Since an = e, Sis nonempty and 
so has a least element, no, called the order of a. 
Proposition 1. If no is the order of a in G, then no divides n, the number of 
elements of G. 
Since an = e by the abstract Fermat theorem, this is a special case of: 
Proposition 2. If no is the order of a in G and am = e, then no divides m. 
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2. Suppose am = e. Let m = noq + r with 0 <; r < no. 
If r = 0 then no divides m. So suppose r > O. Then am = anr//+ r = (ano)qa r • 

F About Finite Fields 
97 
But am = anD = e, SO ar = e. Since I ~ r < no and no was the least number 
such that anD = e, we have a contradiction. Thus r = 0, completing the 
proof.

F. About Finite Fields 
Here is one more application of our abstract version of Fermat's theorem. 
Proposition 3. If F ;s a field with n elements, and a ¥= 0 ;s any element of F, 
then an-I = 1. 
PROOF. The nonzero elements of F form an abelian group of order n - 1 
under multiplication. This is Example (2). 
D 
To show that there really exist fields with a finite number of elements 
besides 7Lp ' so that Proposition 3 is really more general than the original 
Fermat's theorem, we examine GF(9), a field containing 9 elements which 
appeared in Chapter 8, Exercise E19. Note that 7L9 is not a field. 
The set GF(9) is constructed from 7L3 in exactly the s~me way that the 
complex numbers are constructed from the real numbers. 
In 7L3, just as in R, we cannot solve the equation x 2 = - 1. So we let i be 
a "formal" solution, ;2 = - 1, and let GF(9) be the set of numbers a + bi 
where a and b are in 7L3• Denote the elements of 7L3 by [Oh = 0, [113 = I, 
and [-113 = [213 = 2. Then GF(9) consists of the set of all linear combina-
tions of I and; with coefficients in 7L3, namely: 
0=0·1+0.-i 
;=0·1+1·; 
1=I·l+0·i 
2=2·1+0·; 
1+;=I·l+l-i 
2+i=2·l+1·i 
2i = O· 1 + 2 . i 
1 + 2i = 1 . 1 + 2 . i 
2 + 2i .= 2 . 1 + 2 . i 

98 
II Fermat's Theorem, I: Abelian Groups 
Multiplication of these elements is defined by the distributive law and 
the condition that i· i = [-113 = 2. For example, (2 + i)(l + i) = 2 + 2i + i 
+ i2 = 2 + 2i + i + 2 = 1. 
One way of thinking about GF(9) is that it is the set of congruence 
classes mod 3 of the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi, where a 
and b are integers. 
We will show in a later chapter that GF(9) is a field. In it, Proposition 3 
holds. For example, in GF(9), (1 + 2i)8 = 1. In fact, the order of (1 + 2i) is 
8, and every nonzero element of GF(9) is a power of 1+ 2i: 
(1 + 2i)1 = I + 2i, 
(I + 2ii = i, 
(1 + 2i)3 = 1 + i, 
(1 + 2i)4 = 2, 
(1 + 2i)5 = 2 + i, 
(1 + 2i)6 = 2i, 
(I + 2i)7 = 1 + 2i, 
(1 + 2i)8 = 1. 
It follows easily that if x is any nonzero element of GF(9), then x 8 = 1. For 
if x = (l + 2iY, then x 8 = (1 + 2i)8' = l' = 1. 
We shall discover many more examples of finite fields like GF(9) in Part 
III.

G. Nonabelian Groups 
The abstract version of Fermat's theorem generalizes to nonabelian 
groups. The proof we gave in Section B does not work in this case, 
however, so we present here another one. 
Theorem. If G is a (not necessarily abelian) group with n elements, and if g is 
in G, then gn = 1. 
To do the proof we need to develop for groups a notion analogous to 
congruence classes. 

G Nonabelian Groups 
99 
Definition. Let g be an element of G. Say x, y in G are right congruent 
(mod g) if x = ygr for some integer r. Write x ==y if x and yare right 
congruent (mod g). 
Proposition 1. For any x, y, z in G: x ==x (reflexivity); if x ==y then y =x 
(symmetry); if x ==y and y ==z then x ==z (transitivity). 
E30. Prove Proposition 1. 
Recall that congruence (mod m) of natural numbers satisfied the prop-
erties listed in proposition 1. 
Definition. A relation == which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive is 
called an equivalence relation. 
Fact. If == is an equivalence relation on a set S, then == divides up S into a 
collection of mutually disjoint subsets as follows: Define x, y to be in the 
same subset iff x == y. The collection of subsets is denoted S / == . 
Definition. Let < g) denote the set of all positive and negative powers of g. 
Then the collection of disjoint subsets of G under right congruence mod g 
is called the set of left cosets of < g). The left coset containing x is denoted 
x<g). Then x<g) = y<g) iff x = ygr for some integer riff y-Ix is in <g). 
Proposition 2. The function CPx which takes gr in < g) to xgr in x< g) is a 
1-1 correspondence. Thus any two left cosets have the same number of 
elements. 
E31. Show that q,x is 1-1 and maps onto x<g). 
Proposition 3. If g has order r in G and <g) has s cosets, then G has rs 
elements. 
PROOF. If g has order r, then <g) has r elements. So x<g) has r elements 
for each x. Since each element of G is in exactly one coset, if there are r 
elements in each coset and s cosets, there are rs elements in G. 
0 
PROOF OF THEOREM. The theorem follows, for if G has n elements and g 
has order r, then n = rs for some s, so gn = grs = e.

E32. If G = 7L with * = addition, and g = m, what is <

of <g)? 
E33. Let G~(7L3) be the set of invertible 2 X 2 matrices with entries in 7L3, a group 
under multiplication. Write down all the elements of GL2(7L3) and verify that 
the order of each element divides the number of elements of the group. 
E34. Prove the fact about equivalence relations cited above. (Compare Chapter 7, 
the definition of congruence class, and Chapter 1, Exercise E6.)

a triangle. The six invertible 2 X 2 matrices with entries in 71.2 give six ways 
of permuting the elements of T, as follows: If A is an invertible 2 X 2 matrix, 
then (~) ~A( ~), (~) ~A( ~), (

that each permutation of T arises from some matrix A. 

Repeating Decimals, I 12 
In Chapter 5 we introduced base a expansions of fractions. It turns out, as 
we shall see in this chapter, that Euler's theorem gives information about 
those expansions. 
We begin by solving Exercises El5 and El6 of Chapter 5. 
Theorem 1. Any rational number has an eventually repeating base a expan-
sion, for any base a. 
EXAMPLES. Let a = 10. Then 1/7 = .l428571428 . .. is repeating with 
period of length 6; 1/12 = .08333 ... is repeating starting with the third 
digit with a period of length 1; 3/14 = .21428571428. .. is repeating 
starting with the second digit with a period of length 6; 1/5 = .2000 ... is 
repeating starting wit1J. the second digit with a period of length 1. We shall 
denote these eventually repeating decimal expansions by 
1/7 = (.142857 )\0' 
1/12 = (.083)10' 
3/14 = (.2142857 )\0' 
1/5 = (.20)\0. 
We shall say that 1/7 is strictly repeating since it has the form 
(.a l ••• ad). 
Define the period of u / t in base a to be the smallest d > 1 such that 
u/t = (.r l r2 ... rmrm+1 ... rm+d)a for some m. 
PROOF OF THEOREM 1. Let the fraction be r / s, which we may as well 
assume is reduced to lowest terms, so that (r, s) = 1. To get the base a 

102 
expansion we successively divide by s as follows: 
Then 
r = s% + ro with 
ro < s, 
aro = sq) + r), r) < s,

They are all numbers ;;;. 0 and < s, so at least two of the numbers in the set 
{ro, r), ... ,rs } must be equal. Suppose rm = rm+d' where d > 0,0 OS;; m <m 
+ d OS;; s. Then dividing arm + d by s yields the same quotient and remainder 
as dividing arm by s. Thus qm+) = qm+d+) and rm+) = rm+d+1" The same 
argument then shows that qm+2 = qm+d+2 and rm+2 = rm+d+2' etc. Thus 
r/s = (%.q)q2 ... qmqm+) ... qm+d)a' as was to be shown. 
D 
Note that the period d OS;; s. 
El. Show that in fact, d ..;; s - 1. Hint: What if some rj = O? 
In any base a, r / s has an eventually repeating expansion of period 
OS;; s - 1. Can we be more precise about the possibilities for the period? It 
turns out that Euler's theorem and Proposition I of the last section relate 
to this question. In order to simplify the explanation, we first note the 
following. 
E2. Let r / s be a fraction. Show that given any a ;;. 2 there is some n ;;. 0 such that 
anr / s, when reduced to lowest terms = u/ t with (u, t) = I and with (t, a) = 1. 
(Example: with a = 10, r/ s = 3/14, 10·3/14 = 15/7, where (7, 10) = 1.) 
Given exercise E2, any fraction r / s may be written as r / s = 
(l/an)(u/t) with (u, t)= I and with (t, a)= 1. We shall show in our next 
result that u / t has a strictly repeating base a expansion; since r / s = 
(l/an)(u/t) it is clear that the periods of the fractions r/s and u/t are 
equal. 
Theorem 2. Let a ;;;. 2 be a base and let u / t be a fraction with u < t, reduced 
to lowest terms (i.e., (u, t) = I), such that t and a are relatively prime. Then 
u / t has a strictly repeating base a expansion, and the period is the smallest 
integer d> 0 such that ad == 1 (mod t). Hence that length divides <pCt), the 
number of natural numbers < t which are relatively prime to t. 

12 Repeating Decimals, I 
103 
We have called the smallest integer d > 0 so that ad == 1 (mod t) the 
order of a mod t. 
Notice that in the theorem the numerator is irrelevant, provided only 
that it is relatively prime to the denominator. 
For examples, [1% has order 6 in 7L7, so 1/7 has a repeating decimal 
expansion of period 6. So does 2/7, 3/7, 4/7,5/7,6/7. 
[10]101 has order 4 in ZIOI so 13/101 has a repeating decimal expansion 
of period 4. In fact, 13/101 = .1287)10. 
PROOF OF THEOREM 2. The proof involves geometric series. Given u / t 
reduced to lowest terms and with (a, t) = 1, suppose d is some number> 0 
such that ad == 1 (mod t). We show u/ t repeats every d digits, as follows. 
If ad == 1 (mod t), ad - 1 = tw for some w. Then 
u 
uw 
uw 
tw 
ad - 1 
with uw < ad - 1 (since we assumed u < t). 
Now 
I

ad - 1 = a d(l- (l/a d» = ad 1- (l/a d) .

Now uw has a base a representation as

(since uw < ad), with 0,,;; r; < a. Thus

Thus u / t is strictly repeating every d digits.

Now suppose u / t in base a is strictly repeating every e digits for some e. 
That is, suppose 
-7- = (·'e-lre-2 ... '1'0 )a· 
Then, setting w = 'e_lae- 1 + 'e_2ae-2 + ... + 'Ia + '0' 
~ = w[ ~ + _1 + ... ] = _w_. 
t 
a e

ae - 1 
Since (u, t) = 1 and tw = u(ae - 1), t divides ae - 1, so ae == 1 (mod t). 
It follows that the set of numbers d ~ 1 such that ad == 1 (mod t) is the 
same as the set of numbers e ~ 1 such that u / t repeats in base a every e 
digits. So the least d, namely the order of a mod t, is the least e, namely the 
period of u/t in base a. 
Finally, since a</>(t) = 
1 (mod t), the order of a mod t divides cf>(t) by 
Proposition 1, Chapter I-11E, so the period of u/t in base a divides cf>(t). 
That completes the proof.

Error-correcting Codes, I 13 
Error-correcting codes is an application of 7L2 and other finite fields which 
was discovered only around 1948. Our exposition will assume some 
acquaintance with matrices and vectors. For a review of notation see 
Chapter 9A. 
The problem is the following. Suppose a message consisting of blocks of 
digits, or words, is to be transmitted through a channel to a receiver. If the 
channel is "noisy" and tends to introduce random errors into what was 
sent, i.e., change digits, how can the receiver determine what was sent? 
The basic idea for the solution is to send messages with redundant data, 
that is, messages with digits which are repeated, partially repeated, or 
presented in a certain special format. The receiver can detect or even 
correct errors in the digits of the message received, by seeing how what was 
received varies from the format in which the message was known to be 
originally sent. 
An example. Suppose the message consists of 4-digit decimal numbers. 
Here is a simple way of checking for an error in one digit, analogous to 
"casting out 9's." Instead of transmitting "abed," send out "abede," where 
9 divides the base 10 number abede. Thus, instead of sending 3856, send 
38565. If the receiver receives ABCDE, where 9 does not divide the base 10 
number ABCDE, then the receiver knows that at least one of the digits A, 
B, C, D, E is not a digit that was transmitted. On the other hand, if the 
receiver receives ABCDE and 9 divides ABCDE, then either ABCDE = 
abede, or a digit 0 was changed to a 9 or vice versa, or there are errors in at 
least two digits. If the probability is low that an error occurs in any given 
digit, and if ABCDE is divisible by 9, then the probability is high that no 
errors occurred, and the receiver would have confidence that no errors 
occurred. (For example, suppose that the probability of an error in any 

106 
13 Error-correcting Codes, I 
digit is .1. If k, 0 ~ k ~ 5, is the number of digits of ABCDE which equal 0 
or 9, then the probability of no errors if 9 divides ABCDE turns out to be 
approximately (97.5 - k)· 10-2.) 
Here is another example. Suppose we are sending out I-digits numbers. 
Suppose we wish to send a. Code as follows. Send out (for example) the 5 
digit word aaaaa. The receiver would think that the digit A was sent if he 
receives a word with at least three A's in it, and he would be misled only if 
at least three of the a's sent had been erroneously changed to A's, where 
A =l=a. 
This last code is one in which the receiver not only detects errors, but 
also is able to determine what was sent, that is, to correct the received 
word, despite the presence of up to two errors. A correcting capability is 
very desirable for codes in certain situations. One situation is where the 
receiver is receiving data from a measuring device (such as a space probe), 
which is transmitting measurements as it moves through the thing being 
studied (such as Jupiter's magnetic field) and cannot retransmit data which 
the receiver knows is erroneous. (The channel in this situation would be 
the space through which the radio waves pass, and the noise would be 
radio noise, or static.) Another situation would be where the transmitting 
consists of the placing of data into the memory of a computer-the 
channel here is the memory, which may contain imperfectly manufactured 
components, and the receiving is the retrieval of the data. 
In the two situations just described, the information sent is numerical, 
and might naturally be in numbers expressed in base 2. Since all of the 
mathematics tends to be easiest in base 2 also, we shall henceforth assume 
that we are sending words written in base 2. 
In base 2 here are two examples of codes analogous to those we just 
looked at in base 10: 
EXAMPLE 1. The parity check code. Given n information digits abcd ... e, 
let J=a + b + c + d + ... + e (mod 2) and send abcd . .. eJ. The re-
ceiver receives ABCD ... EF. If A + B + C + D + ... + E ~F 
(mod 2), then there is an odd number of errors, while if =, then there is an 
even number, none, or two, or . .. . If more than one error is extremely 
unlikely, the receiver would have confidence that if A + B + C + D + . . . 
+ E = F (mod 2), then no errors occurred, while if ~, the receiver would 
be able to detect the presence of an error. The receiver would not be able 
to tell where the error is. Nonetheless, this is a very efficient code, since 
n / (n + 1) of each code word is information, and only one digit in each 
word is redundant. 
EXAMPLE 2. The repetition code. Given one information digit a, send the 
word of length n, aaa ... a. The receiver receives ABCD ... E. If the 
number of I's among AB ... E exceeds the number of O's, the receiver 
decides that a = 1; otherwise a = 0 (unless n is even and the number of 
I's:::; the number of O's). The receiver will decode incorrectly only if there 
are at least n /2 errors in AB ... E. This code then corrects up to n /2 

13 Error-correcting Codes, I 
107 
errors in the sense that if there are less than n /2 errors the receiver can 
determine correctly the transmitted word. This code is, however, quite 
inefficient, for only 1/ n of each code word is information and n - 1 digits 
in each word are redundant. 
The development of codes has tended to proceed from the assumption 
that it is desirable to have codes which are both efficient (that is, the ratio 
of information digits per word to word length is "large") ahd capable of 
correcting errors in a small proportion of the digits of each word. 
In the rest of this chapter we describe two examples of efficient codes 
constructed using matrices with entries in 7L2• These codes are examples of 
codes described by R. W. Hamming of Bell Telephone Laboratories and 
published in 1950. In Chapter 111-9 we shall describe other codes. 
Code I. Here is an example of a code which corrects one error in words 
of length 7, where each word has 4 information bits. 
We work with elements of 7L2. We write [Ob = 0, [lh = 1, so 7L2 = {O, l}. 
Our words are 7-tuples with entries in 7L2• 
Let 
o 
1 o 
1 
1 o 
o o

1 
(This matrix H has the property that for r, s, t in 7L2 not all zero, 
is the (tsr)rth column of H. In particular, all columns of H are different, 
an important fact.) 
Let (a, b, c, d) be a typical word which we wish to transmit, where 
a, b, c, d are in 7L2• We call (a, b, c, d) the information word. Form the 
vector 
x 
y 
a 
C= 
z 
b 
c 
d 
with x, y, z chosen so that HC = 0, that is, so that (in 7L2) 
x+a+b+d=O 
y+a+c+d=O 
z + b + c + d = o. 
(1) 
Then x,y, z are uniquely and quickly determined from a, b, c, d using H. 
Here (x, y, z) is the redundant part of the word, and C, a vector made up 
of the information word (a, b, c, d) and the redundancy (x,y, z), is the 
coded word. The word C is what is transmitted. Suppose the receiver 

lOS 
13 Error-correcting Codes, I 
recelves 
b7 
Case O. Suppose R = C. Then HR. = 0, because HC = O. 
Case l. Suppose R differs from C in at most one entry. Then R - C = E 
has 1 in some entry and 0 in all other entries. Then HE is the column of H 
corresponding to the location of the 1 in E; when the receiver computes 
HR, she gets: 
HR. = HC + HE = 0 + HE = (the column of H corresponding to 
where the I is in E). 
Since all columns of H are distinct, if there is one error, the receiver can 
determine where the error is by examining HR.; once she knows E, she 
knows R - E = C, the word which was transmitted. 
Case 2. If R differs from C in two or more entries, then HR. = HC + HE 
= 0 + (sum of two or more columns of H). Since the sum of two or more 
columns of H is either 0 or a column of H, the receiver will decode 
inaccurately if she assumes no errors or one error occurred. 
Thus this code is capable of correcting exactly one error. That is, if the 
receiver can confidently assume that at most one error occurred in the 
transmission of a word, then the receiver will be able to confidently 
determine what was sent. She will be misled iff more than one error occurs 
in a given word. (If p, the probability of an error in any given digit, is 
p = .1, then the probability of at most one error in a word is e = (1- .If + 
7(1 - .1)\1) = .S5; if p = .01, e = .99S.)

Then x,y, z satisfy equations (1) of Code I, and w satisfies 
O=w+x+y+z+a+b+c+~ 
Adding this equation to equations (1) of Code I yields the simpler equation 
defining w: 
w + a + b + c = O. 
Transmit the vector C. 
Suppose the receiver receives R. 
Case O. R = C. No errors. Then HR = Q. 
Case 1. R - C = E has one nonzero entry, one error. Then HR = HE 
since HC = 0, and HE is the column of H corresponding to where the error 
occurred. Since all columns of H are distinct, the location of the error can 
be found, and the error can be corrected. 
Case 2. R - C = E has two nonzero entries, two errors. Then HR = HE 
is the sum of two columns of H. It cannot be determined which two 
columns of H make up the sum. For example, here are two sums of 
columns of H: 
[1] + [~] = [1] = [t] + [~]. 
But what is certain is that HE is not a column of H, since the sum of two 
columns of H always has top entry = 0, and every column of H has top 
entry = 1. 
This, then, is a code which corrects one error and detects two errors in 
words of length 8 with 4 information digits. The receiver will be misled 
only if there are 3, 5, or 7 errors. 
El. Here is a collection of received words which were transmitted after being 
encoded with code II. For each word assume there are 0, I, or 2 errors.

the minimum distance and the error correcting ability of the code?

This is a famous theorem of number theory, so called because it was 
known to the ancient Chinese. Its proof is another application of the fact 
that the greatest common divisor of two numbers can be written as a linear 
combination of the two numbers. 
Chinese remainder theorem. If m l , mz, ... , mn are pairwise relatively prime 
natural numbers > 1, and aI' az, ... , an are any integers, then there is a 
solution of the simultaneous congruences 
x == al (mod ml ), 
x == az (mod mz), 
(1) 
If x and x' are two solutions, then x ==X' (mod M), where M = 
mlmz ··· mn" 
PROOF. We first solve the special case of (1) where i is some fixed 
subscript, a; = 1, and al = az = ... = a;_1 = a;+1 = ... = an = O. 
Let k; = mlmz · .. m;_lm;+1 ••. mn. Then k; and m; are relatively 
prime (why?) so we can find integers rand s such that rk; + sm; = 1. 
This gives the congruences rk; == O(mod k;), rk; == 1 (mod m;). Since 

A The Theorem 
113 
ml, m 2, ... , mi _ l, mi + l, ... ,mn all divide ki' it follows that Xi = rki satis-
fies 
Xi == 0 (mod ml ), 
Xi == 0 (mod m2), 
Xi == 0 (mod mi _ I), 
Xi == 1 (mod mJ, 
Xi == 0 (mod mi + I)' 
For each subscript i, 1 .;;; i .;;; n, we find such an Xi' To solve the system 
of congruences (1), set X = alxl + a2x 2 + ... + anxn· Then X ==aixi ==ai 
(mod mi ) for each i, I .;;; i .;;; n, so X is a solution to the congruences (1). 
As to uniqueness, suppose also x' ==ai (mod mi) for each i. Then X -
x' 
== 0 (mod mJ for each i. So mi divides X - x' for each i; hence the least 
common multiple of all the m;'s divides X -
X'. But since the mi are 
pairwise relatively prime, this least common multiple is the product M. So 
X ==x' (mod M). 
0 
El. Why are k; and m; relatively prime? 
Another way to solve these congruences is to do them two at a time. 
The congruence x == a l (mod ml ) is solved by any x of the form 
x = a l + mlul , where UI is arbitrary. 
If also x is to satisfy x ==a2 (mod m2), then x must satisfy x = a l + mlul 
= a2 + m 2t2 for some UI ' t2. We solve this, if we can, for UI , t2 by Bezout's 
identity, and let X2 = a l + mlul = a2 + m 2t2. Then x = x 2 solves 
x == a l (mod ml ), 
x == a2 (mod m2). 
The general solution to these congruences is then x = X 2 + [ml' m2]u2, 
where U2 is arbitrary and [ml' m2] is the least common multiple of ml and 
m2· 
If x is required also to satisfy x == a3 (mod m 3), then x must satisfy 
x = X2 + [ml' m 2]u2 = a3 + m3t3 for some U2' t3' We solve x 2 = [ml' m 2]u2 
= a3 + m3t3' if we can, for U2, t3' Let X3 = a3 + m3t3 = x 2 + [mJ> m 2]u2. 
Then the general solution to the first three congruences is x = X3 + 
[[ml' m 2], m 3]u3, where u3 can be any integer. 

114 
14 The Chinese Remainder Theorem 
If also x is required to satisfy x == a4 (mod m4)' then we solve X3 + 
[[ml' m2]' m3]u3 = a4 + m4/4 for U3' 14' if we can; we set X4 = a4 + m4/4 and 
get the general solution x = X4 + [[[ml' m~, m3], m4]u4, etc. 
This approach has the advantage of giving solutions, if there are any, 
even if the moduli ml , ... , mr are not relatively prime. See Exercise E5. 
EXAMPLE. We solve 
x == 3 (mod 11), 
x == 6 (mod 8), 
x == - 1 (mod 15). 
By the method in the proof we find XI' solving 
XI == 1 (mod 11), 
XI == 0 (mod 8), 
XI == 0 (mod 15) 
by solving r(l20) + s(ll) = 1: r = - 1, s = 11, therefore XI = 120r = - 120. 
Then we solve find X 2, solving 
X2 == 0 (mod 11), 
X2 == 1 (mod 8), 
X 2 == 0 (mod 15) 
by solving r(165) + s(8) = 1: r = - 3, s = 62, therefore X2 = 165r = - 495. 
Then we find x3, soiving 
X3 == 0 (mod 11), 
X3 == 0 (mod 8), 
X3 == 1 (mod 15) 
by solving r(88) + s(15) = 1: r = 7, s = - 41, therefore x3 = 88r = 616. 
Then X = 3( -120) + 6( -495) + (-1)(616) = - 3946 is a solution to the 
original congruences. So is X = - 3946 + u(1320) for any u, so the smallest 
positive solution is with u = 3, X = 14. 
By the alternate method, we solve X == 3 (mod 11): XI = 3 + 11 UI is the 
general solution. Then we solve also X == 6 (mod 8): X2 = 6 + 8/2 = 3 + 
11ut • Solving for 12, U t in 3 = HUt - 8/2, we get U t = 12 = 1. Then x2 = 14 
+ 88u2 is the general solution of the first two congruences. 
Then we solve also X == - 1 (mod 15): X3 = 14 + 88u2 = - 1 + 15/3, 
Solving 15 = 15/3 - 88u2' we get 13 = 1, u2 = O. So X3 = 14 + 1320u3 is the 
general solution to all three congruences. 
E2. Here is an old Chinese problem. 
Three rice farmers raised their rice collectively, and divided it equally at 
harvest time. One year each of them went to a different market to sell his 
share of the rice. Each of the three markets only bought rice in multiples of

a certain base weight, which differed at each of the three markets. The first 
farmer sold his rice at a market where the base weight was 87 lbs. He sold all 
he could, and returned with 18 lbs of rice. The second farmer sold all the 
rice he could at a market where the base weight was 170 lbs, and returned 
with 58 lbs. The third farmer sold all the rice he could at a market where the 
base weight was 143 Ibs and returned (at the same time as the other two) 
with 401bs. How much rice did they raise together?

B. A Generalization of Fermat's Theorem 
The next result answers a question raised in Chapter 10, Exercise E7, on 
secret codes. 
A natural number is squarefree if it is a product of distinct primes, that 
is, it is not divisible by any square > 1. 
Proposition. Given a natural number m, there is some q > 1 (depending on 
m) such that for all integers a, a q =a (mod m) if and only ifm is squarefree. 
In fact, if m = P,P2 ... Pr, a product of distinct primes, and 
q = k[PI-I,P2-1, ... ,Pr-l] + 1 
for any natural number k, then a q =a (mod m) for all a. 
PROOF. Suppose m = PIP2 .. . Pr with PI,P2' ... ,Pr all distinct primes. 
Then for any a in 7L. and any q > I, 
aq = a (modm) 
iff 
a q = a (modp;) for each i, 1 ..;; i ..;; r. 
This is by the uniqueness part of the Chinese remainder theorem. 
Now let q = % + I, where qo is any common multiple of PI - I,P2-
1, ... ,Pr - 1. Then for each i between 1 and r, qo = (Pi - l)qi for some qi' 

B A Generalization of Fermat's Theorem 
117 
so 
a q = aqo+ I = a(P,-I)q,+ I = a(P -I)q,. a. 
If a and Pi are relatively prime, then aP,-1 == 1 (modp;) (by Fermat); 
otherwise a == 0 (mod p;). In either case we get that 
a q = (aP,-I)q'a ==a modpJ 
for each i between 1 and r. Thus a q ==a (mod m). 
On the other hand, suppose m = p['P2' ... P:' with some ei > 1. 
Suppose, for example, that el > 1. Then, using the Chinese remainder 
theorem, let x = a be a solution of 
x ==p[,-I (modp['), 
x == 0 (modp22), 
x == 0 (mod P:'). 
Then m does not divide a because PI' does not divide a, but m does divide 
a q for any q> 1. So a ~ 0 (mod m), but a q == 0 (mod m) for any q> 1; 
hence a q ~a (mod m) for any q > 1. 
0 
EXAMPLE. Since 26 = 13 . 2, the corollary applies to 71.26, and we get that for 
any integer a, aI3 ==a (mod 26). 
E13. Find q and verify that a q ==a (mod m) for all a where 
(i) m = 6,

Secret Codes, II 
This chapter may be read independently of Chapter 10, and may be 
omitted without loss of continuity. 
Euler's theorem may be used as the basis of an effective cipher, or secret 
code. This cipher was suggested by R. L. Rivest, A. Shamir and L. 
Ad1eman of M.LT. in 1977 based on ideas of Diffee and Hellman (1976). 
We first show how the cipher works, and then try to explain why it is 
effective. 
Assuming the messages are in English, associate space and letters to 
base 100 digits, or 2-digit base 10 numbers, in any convenient way, such as 
the following. 
ABC 
o 
01 
02 
03 
15 
T 
y 
20 
25 
z 
26 
(space) 
00 
We thereby replace the English message by a sequence of base 100 digits. 
Then we divide up the sequence of digits into "words," or base 100 
numbers, each containing a fixed number r > 1 of base 100 digits. 
EXAMPLE. The message RETREAT becomes the sequence of base 100 
digits 18 05 20 18 05 01 20. If we want r-digit words with, say, r = 3, we 
collect the digits into 3-digit base 100 numbers (or 6-digit ordinary num-
bers): 180520 180501 200000 (where the zeros at the end denote spaces). 
N ow choose some number q so that no prime dividing q is smaller than 
the largest possible word. This requirement on q guarantees that all the 
words of our message are relatively prime to q. 
Encode the message as follows. Pick some number s which is relatively 
prime to cp(q) (= Euler's cp function). Then there is some number t such 
that st =- 1 (mod cp(q»; hence for any w relatively prime to q, (wsy =-w 
(mod q). 
El. Prove this. 

15 Secret Codes, II 
119 
Encode the message by taking a word wand finding z < q so that 
W S =z (mod q). Then z is the corresponding word in the coded message. 
Given a coded word z, the receiver decodes it by finding w' with w' < q 
and z! =w' (mod q). 
If the encoder started with w < q and the receiver ends up with w' < q, 
then w' = (wsy = w (mod q); since both wand w' are < q, they must be 
equal. 
To illustrate with a code easy to do by hand computations, let r = 1 and 
let q = 101, a prime. Then cp(q) = 100. Let s = 3. Then for t = 67, st = 201 
= 1 (mod 100). Suppose the message is HELLO. The words are 08, 05, 12, 
12, 15. The sender encodes using the pair (101, 3). He takes each word and 
raises it to the third power mod 101, 
83 = 7 (mod 101), 
53 = 24 (mod 101), 
123 = 11 (mod 101), 
153 = 42 (mod 101), 
to get the coded message, 07, 24, 11, 11,42. The receiver decodes by using 
the pair (101, 67): she takes each of the coded numbers and raises it to the 
67th power mod 101. One can verify by hand that 767 = 8 (mod 101), etc. 
Or for a more complicated example which is still easy to do with a hand 
calculator, let r = 2 and q = 2803, a prime. Then cp(2803) = 2802 = 2 . 3 . 
467. Let s = 113. Then we solve 113t + 2802x = 1 as in Chapter 3, to get 
t = - 1339, x = 54. Since - 1339 = 1463 (mod 2802), we find that 113· 
1463 = 1 (mod 2802). 
We encode the message GO, or 0715. To do that we find the least 
nonnegative residue of 715 113 (mod 2803) by the technique of Chapter 12: 
we write 113 = (l110001h, and obtain 715 113 by the sequence of operations 
XSXSXSSSSX where X means "multiply by 715 and reduce mod 2803," 
and S means "square the result and reduce mod 2803," working from left 
to right beginning with 1:

715 113 = 1301300 = 708. 

120 
15 Secret Codes, II 
So the encoded word is 0708, or, in English, GH. (In general the coded 
numerical word will not translate into English.) 
We decode by raising 708 to the 1463 power mod 2803. We omit the 
decoding calculations, which should yield 0715. 
E2. Encode the message NO using this code. 
In practice, coding is done using a computer. Choose r to be large, and 
q to be the product of two primes, PI and P2' each of at least 2r + 1 
decimal digits. Choose S to be relatively prime to cf>(q) = (PI - 1)(p2 - 1). 
To encode, divide the message into words with r letters, which translate 
into numbers with r base 100 digits, and raise each to the sth power mod q. 
The receiver, if she knows cf>(q», can find t with st == 1 (mod cf>(q», and 
can decode by taking the received numerical words and raising each to the 
tth power (mod q) to get the original numerical message. 
Why is the code effective? 
Suppose someone wished to read an intercepted message, encoded using 
q and s, and suppose even that the interceptor knew q and s. All he would 
have to do is factor q, find cf>(q), and solve st == 1 (mod cf>(q». But the first 
task turns out to be a formidable problem, and that is the key to the 
secrecy of the code. 
For example, suppose r = 31 and q were the product of two unknown 
63-digit prime numbers. (For finding such large primes, see Part III, 
Chapter 3.) According to the designers of this code, if the factorization of q 
is unknown, it will take many centuries of computer time on the fastest 
known computer to factor q. (On the other hand, if the factors of q are 
known, it is a matter of a few seconds of computer time to find t and 
decode the message.) Thus unless the factorization of q is revealed, the 
code is in practice unbreakable. 
Thus one could make q and s (but not the prime factorization of q) 
public knowledge. For example, if agent A wished to send a message to 
agent B, A could take the message, encode it using q and s, which are 
public, and send the message. Only B would know t, so only B could 
decode the message. 
If A and B wished to exchange messages and be sure that no third party 
were either intercepting messages or sending spurious messages, they could 
each be assigned a pair of numbers: to A, qA and SA; to B, qB and SB' Both 
would know (qA' SA) and (qB' SB)' but only A would know tA and only B 
would know tB • To send a message to B, A would encode it twice: first by 
using the pair (qA' tA)' then by using (qB' SB)' B would decode first using 
(qB' tB), then using (qA' SA)' Since A encoded using the secret exponent tA, 
which B was able to decode, B would know the message was sent by A. 
Since only B knows the secret exponent tB , A would know that only B 
could decode the message. Thus communication between A and B would 
be secure.

For more discussion of this cipher, see Gardner (1977). For an indica-
tion of how useful ciphers such as this may be, see Shapley and Kolata 
(1977). 
E3. Let r = 1, q = 29, s = 4. Encode and decode the message RETREAT. 
*E4. Fermat's theorem says that if q is prime, for any a with (a, q) = 1, a q- I := 1 
(mod q). For testing to see whether a number q is prime it would be useful if 
the converse were true, namely, that if for all a with (a, q) = 1, a q - I := 1 
(mod q), the q is prime. Show that the converse just described is false by 
showing that q = 561 is a composite number, and for all a with (a, q) = 1, 
aq - I := 1 (mod q). 
ES. Suppose q is squarefree. Use Exercise E14, Chapter 14, to show that if s is 
any integer relatively prime to q,(q), there is some integer t such that (w·)t:=w 
(mod q) for all w, not just for w relatively prime to q. 
E6. (a) Suppose given q, s, t satisfying (as in E5) the property that for all w, 
(wsY:=w (mod q). Show that one can use (q, s) and (q, t) to encode and 
decode numerical words of any size < q, not just words of size < any prime 
divisor of q, as specified in the text. 
(b) Set up such a code for q = 7 . 11 . 37 = 2849. Use it to encode and 
decode the message FOOL, making it form two coded words. 

II. POLYNOMIALS 
This part of the book is about polynomials. Many of the results we 
obtained for integers in Part I have analogues for polynomials. For 
example, every polynomial factors uniquely into a product of irreducible 
polynomials. We show this in Chapter 2. Much of the rest of Part II is 
devoted to trying to determine irreducible polynomials and find factoriza-
tions of polynomials with coefficients in various fields. Ideas from Part I 
such as congruences and the Chinese remainder theorem reappear for 
polynomials as useful tools in studying factorizations. The analogue for 
polynomials of congruence classes will appear in Part III. 

Polynomials 1 
This part of the book is about polynomials, with coefficients in a field F. 
You are already familiar with polynomial functions with real coefficients 
from calculus. They are the simplest functions arising in calculus: exam-
ples are p(x) = 2 - 3x + x 2, p(x) = X - tx3, p(x) = 2, etc. A general exam-
ple is 
p(x) = ao + a\x + a2x2 + ... + anx n, 
where ao, ... , an are real numbers, and n is some integer > O. 
In writing a polynomial function in this way, we are using the conven-
tion customarily used in calculus of describing a function by what it does 
to a "typical" or "variable" or "indeterminate" real number x. In this 
notation we know how to add two polynomial functions, multiply a 
polynomial by a constant scalar, or multiply two polynomials-it is the 
same as for any function: x is thought of as being a typical real number, 
and the sum (product) of two functions, applied to x, is defined to be the 
sum (product) of the values of the functions at x. Thus if 
p(x) = ao + a\x + ... + anx n, 
and 
then 
p(x) + q(x) = (ao + a\x + ... + anxn) + (bo + b\x + ... + bmxm); 
if, say, m > n, we can collect terms and get 
p(x) + q(x) = (ao + bo) + (a\ + b\)x 
+ ... + (an + bn)x n + bn+\x n+\ + ... + bmxm. (1) 

126 
I Polynomials 
Similarly, 
p(x)· q(x) = (ao + ... + anxn)(bo + ... + bmxm) 
= aobo + (aobl + albo)x + ... + ( ~ a;bj)x k ••• + anbmxn+m. 
;+j=k 
(2) 
We abstract from the "calculus" way of describing functions to get a 
general definition of a polynomial. 
A polynomial (not a polynomial function) with coefficients in a field F is 
defined to be an expression of the form 
p(x) = ao + alx + ... + anxn, 
where ao, aI' ... ,an are in F and x is an indeterminant-not an inde-
terminant element of F, but simply a formal symbol. Thus two polynomi-
als 
and 
are equal precisely when ao = bo, al = bl , •.. ,a; = b;, . .. for all i. (In 
particular, if m < n, am+ I = am +2 = ... = an = 0.) 
Equality of polynomials, as we have just defined it, is not the same as 
equality for functions. It is true that any polynomialp(x) in F[x] defines a 
function on F by substitution: the function defined by p(x) sends a in F to 
p(a). However, two functions on F are defined to be equal precisely when 
the two functions have equal values on every element of the set F. It is 
possible for two polynomials to define equal functions on F without being 
equal as polynomials. Here is an example. Let F = 7L2, let p(x) = x-I, let

that if F has infinitely many elements, like F = ~, then two polynomials 
which define the same function on F must be equal as polynomials. 
El. Using Fermat's theorem. find for each prime number p two different poly-

The set of all polynomials with coefficients in F is denoted F[x]. 
We say p(x) has degree n if p(x) = ao + alx + ... + anxn and an =1= O. 
The polynomial 0 = 0 + Ox + Ox2 + . . . , by convention, has degree - 1. 
If p(x) =1= 0, its degree, denoted deg(p(x», is ~ O. 
The field F is contained in F[x]: an element a of F can be thought of as 
a polynomial of degree 0, namely, a + Ox + Ox2 + . .. . 
If we define addition and mUltiplication of polynomials by formulas (1) 
and (2), it is easy to see that F[ x] is a commutative ring, and has no zero

divisors. To see the latter, suppose p(x), q(x) are two nonzero polynomials 
in F[x], where p(x) = amxm + am_Ixm- 1 + ... + alx + ao and q(x) = 
bnxn+ bn_Ixn- 1 + ... +blx+bo. We show p(x)·q(x):;60. By 0 is 
meant the polynomial 0+ Ox + OX2 + ... , and p(x)q(x) = ° 
means that 
each coefficient of p(x)q(x) is equal to zero. 
Assume p(x) has degree m and q(x) has degree n, so am :;6 0, bn:;6 0. It 
follows that ambn :;6 0 since am' bn are in F, a field. But ambn is the 
coefficient of x m+n in p(x)q(x). Therefore, p(x)q(x):;6 0, and F[x] has no 
zero divisors. 
Although we defined polynomials in terms of the indeterminant, or 
formal symbol x, it is possible, and in some cases more convenient, to 
define a polynomial without using x. We may define a polynomial with 
coefficients in F as an infinite sequence 
of elements of F satisfying the condition that all an from some point on are 
equal to 0: 
for some d, the degree of the polynomial. 
We add two polynomials in this notation as follows: 
(ao, aI' ... , an' ... ) + (bOo bl , ... , bn, ••• ) 
= (ao + bo, al + bl , ... , an + bn, ... ); 
and we multiply two polynomials as follows: 
(ao, aI' ... , an' ... )(bo, bl , ... , bn, ... ) 
= (aobo, aobl + albo, ... , 
~ a;ij, ... ). 
i+;=k 
(I') 
(2') 
We can identify these sequences with the polynomials described in 
terms of the indeterminate x, by identifying (ao' aI' ... ,ad' 0, 0, ... ) with 
ao + alx + ... + adxd. Thus to x 2 is associated (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, ... ); to 
4 + x + 3x4 -
x 6 is associated (4, 1,0,0,3,0, - 1,0,0, ... ). Addition 
and multiplication are the same in either version. (This identification is the 
kind of thing which happens in linear algebra when one writes coordinates 
of a vector with respect to a basis. Here the vector space is F[x], the 
scalars are F, the basis is I, x, x 2, x 3, ••• , and (ao, aI' ... , ad' 0, ... ) is 
the tuple of coordinates of the vector ao + alx + ... + adxd with respect 
to the basis I, x, x 2, • •• .) 
We shall ordinarily use an indeterminant in describing polynomials, but 
there will be times, especially when multiplying or dividing, when it is 
useful to recall that a polynomial may be thought of as a tuple of 
coefficients, and "detach the coefficients."

I t is reasonable to consider polynomials with coefficients from any 
commutative ring, such as not only ~, C, Q, or 7L.p (which are fields), but 
also 7L. or 7L.n , or, for that matter, F[x]. (In Chapter 1-10 we considered 
matrices with entries in 7L.26[t].) When we consider polynomials with 
coefficients in F[x], if we call the indeterminant by y, we get F[x][y], 
which consists of elements of the form 
ao(x) + a)(x)y + alx)y2 + ... + aAx)yd, 
that is, polynomials in two variables. Examples: x2 + y2 - 1, y - x2, 3x4 -
5xy2 + t, etc. Similarly, polynomials in three variables may be thought of 
as polynomials in one variable with coefficients in F[x][y], etc.

E4. If we consider infinite sequences (ao, aI' ... ,am . .. ) of elements of a field F 
and do not assume that from some point on an = 0, we get something called a 
formal power series. For example, the sequence 
(I, I, i, i!, 1! ' ... ) 
is a formal power series. Using powers of x as with polynomials this looks like 
x 2 
x 3 
xn 
l+x+T+3f+··· +1if+ ... 
(the Taylor's series for eX). We can treat formal power series without 
worrying about convergence: indeed, convergence when the field F is not a 
subfield of C may make no sense. We add and multiply using formulas (I') 
and (2'). If we denote the set of all formal power series with coefficients in F 
by F[[X]], then F[[X]] is a commutative ring. Note: F[X] c F[[X]].

Unique Factorization 2 
A. Division Theorem 
Recall that if the polynomial p( x) = aox + . . . + adx d, where ad =1= 0, then 
d = deg(p(x)) is the degree of p(x). The coefficient ad is called the leading 
coefficient of p(x); if ad = I, thenp(x) is called a monic polynomial. 
We shall sometimes call a polynomial of degree .;;; 0 a constant, or a 
scalar, since it can be considered as an element of F, the field of 
coefficients. 
The simple fact that we can assign to a polynomial an integer' > - I, its 
degree, is extremely useful, because it permits for polynomials proofs by 
induction of the same kind that we did for 7L.. In fact, the whole sequence 
of arguments in Chapter 1-3, which showed that 7L. has unique factoriza-
tion, is valid for F[x] if F is a field. We give in this c4apter a concise 
account of how that goes. You may want to refer back tp the arguments 
for 7L. at this point to see how we proceeded there. 
We will often letf, g,p, q, r, etc., denote polynomials, optitting the "(x)" 
in "f(x)." 
The first step, as with the the~)fy for 7L., is the 
Division Theorem for F[ x]. Let F be a field. Let f, g be two polynomials in 
F[x], with f=l= O. There are polynomials q, r, with deg r < degf, such that 
g = fq + r. If also g = fql + rl, with deg rl < degf, then q = ql' r = r\" 
PROOF. We use induction (2) on the degree of the dividend g. Fix f, a 
polynomial of degree > O. If deg g < degf, then g = f· 0 + g satisfies the 
division theorem. Suppose deg g > degf. Let f = adxd + ... + ao, g = 
bd+sxd+s + ... + bo, where s > O. Let g' = g - (bd+s/ ad) x 'i. Then 
deg( g') < deg( g), since we have canceled off the highest power of x. By 

130 
2 Unique Factorization 
induction, g' = Jqo + r for some %, r with deg r < degJ. Then g = 
f(% + (bd+s / ad)x S ) + r, proving the existence of q, r for J and g. 
For uniqueness, suppose g = Jq + r = Jq' + r', deg r < degJ, deg r' < 
degJ. Then 0 = J(q - q') + (r - r'), so J(q' - q) = r - r'. The left side is 
either 0 or a polynomial of degree at least that of J; the right side has 
degree < degJ. Thus equality can only occur if both sides = 0, so r = r', 
q=q'. 
,0 
The argument in getting g from g' in the proof is the first step in the 
process of long division of polynomials, which actually obtains q and r. 
We illustrate this familiar procedure by an example.

x 3 + x2 + 7 = (x 3 + 3x2 + X + 5)(x2 - 3x + 7) - 22x2 + 8x - 28. 
(Note that in detaching the coefficients for dividing, the numbers corre-
spond from left to right with descending powers of x, which is opposite to 
the way we did it in Chapter 1.) 
We shall say that a polynomialJ divides a polynomial g, notation.!1 g, if 
g = Jq for some polynomial q. For example, x 2 - 1 divides X4 -
1, x 2 + X 
+ 1 divides x 6 -
1, while x-I does not divide x 3 - 2. 
Here is a criterion for finding factors of a polynomial. In it the number 
J(a) is obtained by thinking of J(x) as a function and evaluating it at a. 

A Division Theorem 
131 
Root Theorem. If f(x) is a polynomial with coefficients in a field F, and if a 
is in F with f(a) = 0, then x - a divides f(x). 
PROOF. Write f(x) = (x - a)q(x) + rex), using the division theorem. Since 
deg(r(x» < deg(x - a) = 1, rex) must be a scalar, call it r, in F. So 
f(x) = (x - a)q(x) + r. 
View both sides as functions on F and evaluate at x = a. The equation 
becomes ° 
= r. So x - a dividesf(x).

Corollary 1. A nonzero polynomial f(x) of degree n in F[x], F a field, has at 
most n distinct roots in F. 
PROOF. Induction on n. If n = O,f(x) is a nonzero constant polynomial, 
and so has no roots in F. Now suppose f(x) is a polynomial of degree n, 
n > 0, and suppose it has distinct roots aI' ... ,ar in F. Thenf(ar) = 0, so 
by the root theoremf(x) = (x - ar)g(x) where g(x) has degree n - 1. Since 
f(aj ) = ° 
= (aj -
ar)g(aj ) for 1 ..;; i ..;; r - 1, and since aj -
ar =F 0, therefore 
g(a;) = 0, and so g(x) has roots aI' ... ,ar-I' By induction r - 1..;; n - 1 = 
deg(g(x». So r ..;; n. 
0 
Corollary 2. If F is a field with infinitely many elements and f(x) and g(x) 
are any two polynomials with coefficients in F, then f(x) = g(x) as polynomi-
als if and only if f( x) = g( x) as functions on F. 
This says that no confusion will arise if one thinks of polynomials in 
iij[ x] as functions. 
The condition that F have infinitely many elements is necessary, as we 
have observed in Chapter II-I. 
PROOF OF COROLLARY 2. If f(x) = g(x) as polynomials, then for a any 
element of F, f(a) = g(a), so f(x) and g(x) are equal as functions on F. 
Conversely, if f(x) and g(x) are two polynomials, and f(a) = g(a) for 
every a in F, thenf(x) - g(x) = hex) is a polynomial with the property that 
h(a) = 0 for every a in F. Now hex) has degree n for some finite number n; 
if h(a) = 0 for every element a in F, and F has infinitely many elements, 
then hex) has more than n roots in F. So hex) must be the zero polynomial, 
and thusf(x) = g(x) as polynomials, completing the proof.

B. Greatest Common Divisors 
We continue with results worked out in Chapter 1-3 for natural numbers. 
Let f, g be in F[x], F a field. A polynomial p in F[x] is a greatest 
common divisor (g.c.d.) of f and g if p divides f and p divides g, and any q 
in F[x] which also divides bothf and g must satisfy deg q < degp. 
We can find a greatest common divisor of two polynomials by using the 
division theorem many times. The process, called Euclid's algorithm for 
polynomials, goes back at least to Simon Stevin, 1585, and works as 
follows: 
Given two polynomialsf, g in F[x] withf*O, perform the sequence of 
divisions: 
g = fqo + ro, 
f = roqI + r I , 
ro = rIq2 + r2, 
rn- 2 = rn-Iqn + rn, 
rn- I = rnqn + 0. 
Since deg ro < degf, deg r, < deg ro, deg r2 < deg r" etc., the sequence of 
divisions ends after at most degf steps. 
Theorem. In the Euclidean algorithm, the last nonzero remainder rn is a 
greatest common divisor off and g. 
E4. Prove this. 
Note that we carefully said "a greatest common divisor," rather than 
"the greatest common divisor." Two polynomials may have many greatest 
common divisors. If we were to have defined "greatest" for integers as 
"greatest in absolute value," then the greatest common divisor of two 
integers wouldn't be unique either; for example, - 8 and 6 have two 
greatest common divisors in the absolute sense: 2 and - 2. Similarly for 
polynomials: x 2 - 1 and 5x2 + lOx + 5 have many greatest common di-
visors: 2x + 2, 'lTX + 'IT, X + 1, x/17 + 1/17, etc. But all the greatest com-
mon divisors divide each other. This is in general a consequence of 
Theorem. If d is the greatest common divisor off and g, obtained by Euclid's 
algorithm, and e is any other common divisor off and g, then e divides d. 
E5. Prove this. 
From this it follows that two greatest common divisors e, d of f and g 
can differ only by a scalar multiple: d = ae for some a in F. For let d be 

B Greatest Common Divisors 
133 
the greatest common divisor obtained by Euclid's algorithm, and suppose 
it has degree r. If e is a common divisor of f and g, then e divides d. If e is 
a greatest common divisor of f and g, then e also has degree r. Since e 
divides d, d = ae where a is some polynomial, and deg d = deg a + deg e. 
Therefore a has degree 0, so must be a nonzero scalar. Then d/ a = e, so d 
and e divide each other. 
We shall say that two polynomials d, e, such that each is a nonzero 
scalar multiple of the other, are associates. 
EXAMPLE. x 2 + 3x + 1 and 5x2 + 15x + 5 are associates. 
Any polynomial is an associate of exactly one monic polynomial. 
If we lapse into sloppy terminology and talk about the greatest common 
divisor of two polynomials, we will usually have in mind the unique monic 
polynomial which is a greatest common divisor of the two polynomials. 
Generally it won't matter. Any greatest common divisor will serve the role 
of the greatest common divisor. 
Continuing the development as with 71.., we have 
Bezout's lemma. Any greatest common divisor d off and g can be written as 
d = af + bg for some polynomials a, b in F[ x]. 
E6. Prove this. 
Say f and g are relatively prime if any greatest common divisor is a 
constant. In that case 1 is a greatest common divisor, so we can write 
1 = af + bg for some polynomials a, b. 
E7. Write the greatest common divisor of f(x) = x4 + 2x3 - 6x - 9 and g(x) = 3x4 
+ 8x3 + 14x2 + 8x + 3 as a linear combination of f and g. 
Definition. A polynomial p is a unit if there is another polynomial q with 
pq = 1. 
The only polynomials in F[x], F a field, which are units, are polynomi-
als of degree 0, that is, nonzero constant polynomials or scalars, polynomi-
als which look just like elements of F (Exercise E3, Chapter II-I). 
A polynomial p is irreducible if p is not a unit, and if p = fg, then for g 
must be a unit. 
EXAMPLES. 
X + a is irreducible in F[x] for any field F; 
x2 + 1 is irreducible in ~[x]; 
x 3 + 2 is irreducible in Q[x];

The Fundamental 
Theorem of Algebra 
We have seen that if F is a field, every nonconstant polynomial in F[x] 
factors in an essentially unique way into the product of irreducible poly-
nomials. Thus irreducible polynomials relate to all polynomials in the same 
way that primes do to natural numbers. We naturally ask: Which poly-
nomials are irreducible? 
The question clearly depends on the field F. 
For example, consider the polynomial x 3 - 2. This is a polynomial with 
coefficients in Q, and Q eIRe C, so we can ask about its factorizations in 
Q[x], lR[x], and C[x]. Here they are: 
In Q[ x], x 3 - 2 is irreducible. 
In lR[x], x 3 - 2 = (x - ~ 
)(x2 + ~ 
X + ~). 
In C[x], x3 - 2 = (x - ~ 
)(x - w~ )(x - w2~), where w = e2i'IT/3 = 
- (1/2) + (iY3 /2) satisfies w3 = 1. 
In this book we shall look at the question of which polynomials are 
irreducible when F = C, IR, Q, and 7Lp for p prime. In this chapter we shall 
consider F = C. 
A. Irreducible Polynomials in C[ x] 
The field C was invented to contain roots of irreducible real polynomials; 
for example, i = V-T is a root of x 2 + 1. It is not hard to see that each 
polynomial g(x) = x 2 + ax + b with a, b in C has a root in C. In fact, write 

A Irreducible Polynomials in C[x) 
137 
(a2/4) - b = re ifJ (recall Chapter I-I) and let d = Vi eifJ/2. Then d2 = 
(a 2/4) - b, and 
g( x) = x2 + 2( 1) x + ( 1 f -( 
~2 - b) 
= (x+1f - d2 
= (x+1+ d )(x+1- d ). 
(This is the quadratic formula from elementary algebra.) So every poly-
nomial in C[x] of degree 2 factors into a product of two linear factors. 
It is possible to give a similar explicit factorization of any polynomial of 
degree 3 or 4 in C[ x], based on the fact that we can always find a root in C 
of xn - c for any c in C (write c = re ifJ, set d = Vr eifJ/n, then dn = c). Here 
is how to find roots of any polynomial of degree 3. 
Let J(z) = Z3 + a2z2 + a\z + ao' Set x = z + a2/3; then J(x - a2/3) = 
p(x) has the formp(x) = x3 + qx + r for some q, r. Let w = e2'1ti/3, a cube 
root of 1. As checked by multiplying out and noting that I + w + w2 = 0, 
the following identity holds: 
x3 + x( -3yz) + (y3 + Z3) = (x + y + z)(x + wy + w2z)(x + wy + wz). 
Therefore, if we can solve for y and z in the two equations 
q = -3yz, 
r = y3 + Z3, 
it follows by the identity that x3 + qx + r will have roots - y - z, - wy -
w2z, -wy - wz. 
Now if r = y3 + Z3, - q3/27 = y3z3, then the polynomial (t - y3)(t - Z3)

It is interesting that while there is a procedure for finding roots of any 
polynomial of degree 4 analogous to that for degree 3, there is no 
corresponding way to find the roots of a polynomial of degree ~ 5: that is, 
there is a polynomialp(x) of degree 5 whose roots cannot be described by 
taking the coefficients of p(x) and manipulating them by the usual alge-
braic operations together with the operations of taking nth roots (forming 
radicals), in the way we did for polynomials of degree 2 or 3. This famous 
theorem is due to Abel, the Norwegian mathematician for whom the term 
abelian ("abelian group") was named. 
Despite Abel's theorem there is an even more famous theorem, first 
proved by Gauss, which tells us what we want all at once. 
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Every polynomial p(x) in C[x] of degree 
~ 1 has a root in C. 
Thus the only irreducible polynomials in C[x] are of degree 1. 
B. Proof of the Fundamental Theorem 
The rest of this chapter is devoted to one of the half-dozen or more 
distinctly different proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra. The 
proof we present is essentially a proof of Argand, 1814. It involves a 
minimal acquaintance with functions of two (real) variables, and may be 
omitted without loss of continuity. 
In the proof we shall assume that p(z) is monic, that is, has leading 
coefficient = 1. 
Before beginning the proof we describe some facts we need which go 
into the proof. Let z = x +,y. We think of the complex z-plane as the 
same as the real xy-plane. A polynomialp(z) in C[z] may be written as 
p(z) = p(x +,y) = Pl(X,y) + ip2(X,y), 
wherepl(x,y) andP2(x,y) are real polynomials in the real variables x,y. 
Then Ip(z)1 may be written as 
1 P (z)1 = V""'P-l (-X,-y--:)2:-+-P-2-( x-, -y)-=-2 . 
Sincepl(x,y) andp2(x,y) are real polynomials in x,y,Pl(x,yi + P2(x,yi 
is a nonnegative real-valued continuous function of x,y. Since Vi is a 
continuous function of t for t ~ 0, Ip(z)1 =VPl(x,yi + P2(x,yi is con-
tinuous as a function of x,y. 

B Proof of the Fundamental Theorem 
139 
A basic fact from calculus is that a function continuous on a closed disc 
D = {(x, Y)lx2 + y2 "R} in the xy-plane has a minimum value in D. 
Our proof thatp(z) has a root in C has two parts. 
(I) There is a point Zo in the complex plane such that Ip(zo>l " Ip(z)1 for 
all z in C (not just in some disc). 
(2) If Zo is the point found in part 1, where Ip(zo)1 is a minimum, then 
p(zo) =0. 
We recall the triangle inequality: 
la + bl " lal + Ibl· 
From the triangle inequality we get 
lal = la + b - bl " la + bl + Ibl 
so 
la + bl ~ lal - Ibl· 
Part 1.

Lemma. Let f( z) in q z] have degree ~ 1. Given any positive real number M 
there is some real number R > 0 such that for all z with Izl > R, If(z)1 ~ M. 
PROOF. We proceed by induction on the degree d of f(z). 
First, d = 1, f(z) = a + bz, b =1= O. Then 
If(z)1 = la + bzl ~ Ibzl - lal 
(by (*» 
= Ibllzl - lal· 
Given M, choose R = (M + laD/lbl. Then if Izl > R, If(z)1 > M. 
Assume the lemma is true for polynomials of degree d - 1. Supposef(z) 
has degree d. Then f(z) = a + zft (z), where ft(z) has degree d - 1. 
Given M, choose R ~ 1 so that for Izl > R, Ift(z)1 > M + lal, by induc-
tion. Then for Izl > R, 
!f(z) I = la + Zft(z)1 
~ Izllft(z)1 - lal 
(by (*» 
~ Ift(z)I-lal 
(since Izl >R ~ 1) 
~ M + lal - lal = M, 
proving the lemma by induction. 
o 
To prove the first part of the fundamental theorem, let p(z) = zn + 
an_1zn- t + ... + atz + ao. Choose R so that for Izl > R, Ip(z)1 ~ 1 + laol. 
Let D = {zllzl "R}. From calculus it is known that there is some Zo in D 
such that Ip(zo)1 " Ip(z)1 for all z in D. Now, by the way that we have 
chosen D, Ip(zo)I" Ip(z)1 for all z. For if z is not in D, Izl > R, so 
Ip(z)1 ~ 1 + laol > Ip(O)I. Since 0 is in D, Ip(O)1 ~ Ip(zo)l. Thus Ip(zo)1 " 
Ip(z)1 for all z, in D or not. That completes the first part of the proof. 

140 
3 The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 
Pari 2. Let Zo be the point found in part 1 such that Ip(zo)1 " Ip(z)1 for 
all z. We are going to make two changes of variables to put Zo at the origin 
and make our polynomial look nice. 
First make a change of variables w = z - zoo Then p(z) = p(w + zo) = 
ql(w) is a polynomial in wand Iql(O)1 = Ip(zo)1 " Ip(z)1 = Iql(w)1 for all 
w : Iql(w)1 has its minimum at w = O. 
We want to show that ql(O) = p(zo) = O. If that is the case, we are done. 
So for the rest of the proof we assume that ql(O) = a =1= 0; from that 
assumption we shall reach a contradiction. 
Assuming a =1= 0, let qz(w) = (1/ a)ql(w). Then I qz(w) I has a minimum at 
w = 0 iff Iql(w)1 does. Now qz(w) has the form 
qiw) = 1 + bwm + blwm+1 + ... +bkwm+k, 
where m + k = n = the degree of qz(w) = the degree of p(z). 
Let r be an mth root of -1/ b. Then rmb = - 1. Let w = ru, and set 
q(u) = q2(ru) = qz(w). Then Iq(u)1 has a minimum at u = 0 iff I qz(w) I has a 
minimum at w = O. Now q(u) has the form 
q(u) = 1 + b(ru)m + bl(ru)m+1 + ... +bk(ru)m+k 
(since rmb = -1), 
where 
Q(u) = CI + C2U + ... + CkU k- 1 
is a polynomial in u, with S = bjr m +j for each}, 1 "}" k. 
Note that q(O) = 1, so 1 is the minimum value of Iq(u)l. 
Let t be a real number> O. Setting u = t, 
IQ(/)I = IC I + c21 + ... + Cktk-II 
" Icd + !e21t + ... + !ekl tk- I 
by the triangle inequality. We call this last polynomial Qo(t). It is a 
polynomial with real coefficients, and is > 0 when I is real and > 0. 
As t---?O, tQo(t)---?O. Choose t with 0 < t < 1 so that IQo(t) < 1. 
We show that for this choice of I, setting u = t gives Iq(t)1 < 1 = Iq(O)I, 
contradicting the assumption that Iq(u)1 had its minimum at u = O. Here is 
why Iq(t)1 < 1: 
Iq(t)1 = 11 - tm + Im+IQ(t)1 
" 11 - tml + I/m+IQ(t)1 
= (1 - tm) + tmtl Q( t)1 
" (1- t m) + Im(tQo(/». 
(by the triangle inequality) 
(since 0 < t < 1) 
Since t is chosen so that tQo(t) < 1, this last number is 
< (1 - t m ) + t m = 1 = Iq(O)I. 
Since t =1= 0, Iq(u)1 does not have its minimum at u = O. We have reached a 
contradiction, and the proof is complete.

Irreducible Polynomials in ~[x] 
Given the validity of the fundamental theorem of algebra, determining the 
irreducible polynomials in ~[x] is a simple application of the division 
theorem. 
Theorem. If f(x) is an irreducible polynomial with real coefficients, then 
either 
f( x) has degree I, or 
f(x) = ax2 + bx + c with b2 - 4ac < O. 
PROOF. Clearly any polynomial of degree I is irreducible. 
Supposef(x) = ax2 + bx + c. Thenf(x) factors in C[x] into 
f(x) = a(x+~+_l Yb 2 -4ac )(x+~ __ 
l Yb 2 -4ac). 
2a 
2a 
2a 
2a 
If b2 - 4ac < 0 then these roots of f(x) are not real, so f(x) has no real 
roots (why?) and is therefore irreducible. Thus the two kinds of real 
polynomials we claimed were irreducible in ~[x] are in fact irreducible. 
For the converse, suppose f(x) is an irreducible polynomial of degree 
> 1. Then it has no real roots. Let ex be a nonreal complex root of 
f(x) : f(ex) = O. Say ex = r + is, r, s real, s =1= O. Let ii = r - is. Then 
g(x) - (x - iX)(X - ii) = (x - (r + is»(x - (r - is)) 
= x 2 - 2r + (r2 + S2) 
is in ~[x]. Apply the division theorem with f and g: 
f(x) = g(x )q(x) + r(x), where q(x), r(x) are in ~[x J. 
Then r(x) is a real polynomial of degree;;;;; 1. Think of this equation as an 
equality of functions on C, and set x = ex. Then 0 = f(ex) = g(ex)q(ex) +

rea); g(a) = 0 by the way we constructed g(x), so rea) = O. Now rex) = ax 
+ b with a, b real, so if r( a) = 0, then aa + b = O. Since a is not rea1 this 
equation can hold only when a = b = o. Thus rex) = 0, and we get 
f(x) = g(x)q(x). 
This means thatf(x) is not irreducible, unless q(x) is a constant. If q(x) is a 
constant, f(x) has degree 2 and has no rea1 roots, so has already been 
accounted for. This completes the proof. 
0 
Of course, we used in the proof the fundamental theorem of algebra. 
Thus while we know which polynornia1s are irreducible in R[x] (or C[x]) it 
is substantia1ly harder to see how to factor or to find the roots of a 
polynornia1 we know is not irreducible. In genera1 the roots must be 
obtained by approximation. Such problems form an important part of the 
subject of numerica1 ana1ysis. We shall consider a specia1 case of this 
problem in Chapter 7. 
El. Show that a polynomial of odd degree in IR[ x] with no multiple roots must 
have an odd number of real roots. 
E2. Show that if f(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients and z = r + is in C is a 
root of f(x), then so is z = r - is, the complex conjugate of z. 
E3. Given that fix) = x4 - 4x3 + 3x2 + 14x + 26 has roots 3 + 2i and -I - i, 
factor f into a product of irreducible polynomials in IR[ x]. 
E4. Suppose we look for the roots of f(x) = x 3 - 8x + 2. Since f( -3) = - 1, 
flO) = 2, f(1) = - 5, f(3) = 5, a sketch of the graph of y = fix), or the inter-
mediate value theorem from calculus, shows that f has three real roots. But the 
technique described in Section 3A gives roots expressed as sums of complex 
numbers. What are the three real roots of f(x)?

Partial Fractions 
A. Rational Functions 
In the same way that the field of rational numbers is formed from the ring 
of integers, the field of rational functions may be constructed from the set 
of polynomials with coefficients in a field. A rational function with 
coefficients in the field F is an expression of the formf(x)1 g(x) wheref(x) 
and g(x) are in F[x] and g(x)"., 0; two rational functions are equal, 
f(x) 
hex) 
g(x) = k(x) , 
if k(x)f(x) = g(x)h(x) in F[x]. Call the set of rational functions with 
coefficients in F by F(x) (as opposed to F[x], which denotes the set of 
polynomials with c;oefficients in F). 
Addition and multiplication of rational functions is defined by the usual 
rules for fractions (we drop "(x)"): 
fig + hlk = (fk + hg)/gk; 
(JIg)(hlk) = fhlgk. 
It is very easy to verify that F(x) is a field. A polynomialfmay be viewed 
as a rational function by thinking of it as f 11. 
The terminology "rational function" is somewhat misleading. The ele-
ments of F(x) are not functions on the field F, but formal expressions in 
the same sense as polynomials are. One can evaluate a rational function 
f(x)1 g(x) at any element a of F at which g(a)"" 0, but two rational 
functions may agree when evaluated at every element of F and yet be 
different elements of F(x), such as x 3/(x2 + X + 1) and x in Z2[X]; and 
there may exist rational functions in F(x) which cannot be defined as 
functions on F at all, such as x 3 - x + 1/(x3 - x) in Z3(X), whose de-
nominator gives zero when evaluated at any element of Z3. However, as 

B Partial Fractions

with polynomials, it can be proved that if F is an infinite field, then two 
rational functions which have the same values when evaluated on infinitely 
many elements of F must be equal. 
El. Prove this last assertion. 
B. Partial Fractions 
The method of partial fractions is a way of decomposing a rational 
function f / g into a sum of terms with denominators of degrees smaller 
than g when a factorization of g is known. In case f / g is a rational 
function with real coefficients, viewed as a real-valued function, then 
partial fractions becomes an important technique of integration. In this 
section we shall describe the general method. In the two following sections 
we apply the method to integration and to counting the number of 
solutions to certain equations. 
We assume f( x) and g( x) are in F[ x], where F is an arbitrary field. 
Given f / g, we first use the division theorem, if necessary, to write 
f = gq + r, with deg r < deg g. Then f / g = q + r / g. The basic problem, to 
write f / g as a sum of terms with "nice" denominators, remains for r / g. So 
we shall assume that we started out with f / g, where deg f < deg g. 
Here is the general theorem on partial fractions. 
Theorem. Let g = pi'P{' ... Pre, be a factorization of g into a product of 
powers of relatively prime polynomials Pi' and suppose that degf < deg g. 
Then there are unique polynomials hi' i = 1, ... , r with deg hi < degPiei, 
such that

PROOF. Induction on r, r = I being trivial. 
In order to pass from r - 1 to r, and thus prove the theorem, we let 
a = pi' ... p:~-" b = Pre, and prove the foliowing, which is the induction 
step. 
Lemma. Let g = ab where a and b are relatively prime, and suppose degf < 
deg g. Then there are unique polynomials r, s with deg r < deg a, deg s < 
deg b, so that 
f

The theorem follows. For using the lemma, we may write 
use induction to write 
and set hr = s. 
D 
To prove the lemma, we use Bezout's lemma: since a and bare 
relatively prime, there are polynomials s, , such that 
as + b, = 1, 
where we can choose deg s < deg b, deg, < deg a by Exercise E16, 
Chapter 11-2. Now we divide by g = ab: 
j

gab· 
To show" s are unique is easy. 
D 
Once we have a rational function written as a sum of terms of the form 
j/pe, we can further decomposej/g by representing the numerator in base 
p. 
To write j in base p means to write j=,o + 'IP + ,2p2 + ... + ,kpk, 
where p is any polynomial, and deg'j < degp for all i. In case p(x) = x, 
writing the polynomialj(x) in base x is the way we usually writej(x). If we 
could write j in base p, then j / p e would decompose as 
L = '0 + 'IP + ... + 'kP k 
pe 
pe 
'0'1 
'k 
=-+--+ ... +--
pe 
pe-I 
pe-k 
with deg'j < degp for all i. In case p(x) = x - " this would mean that all 
of the 'j would be constants. 
We write j in base p just as we did with integers, as follows. Divide p 
into j, 
j = pqo + '0' 
then divide p into the quotients, successively: 
qo = pql + 'I' 
ql = pq2 + '2' 

B Partial Fractions 
147 
where deg qk-I < degp. Then f= rkP k + rk_1pk-1 + ... +rlP + ro> as 
can be seen by substituting each successive equation into the first equation. 
Since the quotient and remainder in the division algorithm are unique, the 
representation of f in base p is unique. 
Representation in base p for polynomials is thus essentially the same as 
for integers. 
Writing the numerator in base p and reducing to lowest terms completes 
the decomposition of f / g. 
EXAMPLE. Let 
f(x) 
3x4+ 5 
g(x) = (x 2 + 1)2X 
in ~(x). We can follow the method of partial fractions as just described, 
but it is easier simply to use the result: by the general theory, we know that 
the decomposition should be 
3x4 + 5 = ax + b + ex + d +!.. 
(x2 + lix 
x 2 + 1 
(x2 + 1)2 
x 
for some real numbers a, b, e, d, e. The most direct method is simply to 
put the right side under a common denominator, collect coefficients, 
equate them to the coefficients on the left side, and solve: 
3x4 + 5 
(a + e)x4 + bx3 + (a + e + 2e)x2 + (b + d)x + e 
(x2 + 1)2x 
(x2 + 1)2x 
so 
a + e

a + e + 2e=0

with solution a = - 2, b = d = 0, e = - 8, e = 5.

c. Integrating 
The standard use of partial fractions in calculus is in finding the indefinite 
integral of a rational function f(x)/ g(x), that is, finding a function H(x) 
such that H'(x) = f(x)/ g(x). 
It is assumed that the factorization of g(x) in ~[x] is known. Then by 
partial fractions, f(x) / g(x) can be written as a polynomial q(x) plus a sum 
of terms of the forms 
a 
(x - d)' 
and 

C Integrating 
149 
Thus to integrate l(x)/ g(x) involves finding J q(x) dx, where q(x) is a 
polynomial (very easy), and integrals of the form 
and 
I 
cdx 
(x2 + e2y 
We show how to do these integrals. 
The first is not hard: if r * 1 the integral (1) equals 
a 
------------~I + C; 
(1 - r)(x - dY-
if r = 1 it equals a log(x - d) + C. 
If we let x 2 = u in integral (2), it becomes

bi 
du 
(x 2 + e2y = 2" 
(u + e2y , 
which is of the form (1).

(2)

The remaining integral, integral (3), is more difficult. In calculus books

The formulas for these are essentially the same as in the real case,

On the other hand, the substitution u = tan t solves J du/(I + u2) without

Now for any s, s ;> 1, we have that in formula (5) al = bl' For when we 
put the right side of (5) under the common denominator (1 + U2), the

D. A Partitioning Formula 
In this section we give an application of partial fractions which does not 
involve integration. 
A problem which has classically been of interest in number theory is 
that of counting the number of ways a natural number can be partitioned 
into sums of natural numbers. For example, here are all the ways of 
partitioning the number 5: 
5=1+1+1+1+1 
1+1+1+2 
=1+2+2 
=1+1+3 
=2+3 
=1+4 
= 5. 
There is also the problem of determining the number of ways a natural 
number can be partitioned, subject to restrictions on the numbers making 
up the sum. For example, in how many ways can the number n be 
partitioned into sums involving only the numbers 1, 2, and 3? 
Combinatorial problems such as these are related to problems of practi-
cal present-day interest. Here is an example. A manufacturer of paper 
makes standard rolls of paper of length N, and sells paper in rolls of 

152 
5 Partial Fractions 
smaller lengths nl , ... , n, which one obtains by cutting up the standard 
rolls: 
nl 
nl 
nl 
n2 
n2 
n3 ... N 
How can one cut up the standard rolls in such a way that there is (little or) 
no waste? If all the numbers are integers, and the cutting can be done with 
no waste, then each solution is a (physical) partition of N into a sum of 
integers chosen from among nl , ... , n,. (This problem was actually posed 
in the 1950s by a paper manufacturer, with the extra complication of 
involving a demand for various quantities of rolls of each length nj • The 
problem was solved by the invention of a new kind of algorithmic 
technique, related to linear programming, called integer programming.) 
In this section we illustrate the use of partial fractions in the study of 
partitions, by finding an explicit formula for the number of ways a number 
n can be partitioned into sums of l's, 2's, and 3's. This number of ways is 
the same as the number of solutions (r, s, t) of the equation r' I + s' 2 
+ t· 3 = n with r, s, t ~ O. 
Our starting point is a trick of Euler: 
If a(n) is the number of solutions of r + 2s + 3t = n, r, s, t ~ 0, then 
(1 + x + x 2 + ... )(1 + x 2 + X4 + ... )(1 + x3 + x 6 + ... ) 
n=l 
For multiplying out the left side, and defining a(O) = 1, 
00 L

r, s, 1=0 
00 
00 
L (L X r + 2s+3t) = L a(n)xn. 
n=O 
n=O 
Here the inside sum in the middle term runs through all (r, s, t), 
r, s, t > 0, with r + 2s + 3t = n. For such (r, s, t), r + 2s + 3t = n, of 
course, and there are a(n) solutions. So the inside sum is a(n)xn. What we 
have done is rearrange the series, which is perfectly permissible if x > O. 
Now the series we multiplied together are geometric series in x, x 2, and 
x3 respectively, and we have for Ixl < 1, 
co

We use partial fractions to implement the idea that while it is hard to 
find the coefficient of xn in aproduct of power series, it is easy in a sum of 
power series. So we shall use partial fractions on the right side of (1) to get 
a nice expression for a(n).

Then set x = I, x = - I, x = "', x = ",2. You get the values of C, D, F, and E 
instantly, and the values of A, B from the last two equations of (3). Verify by 
this method that the values of A, B, C, D, E, F in the text are correct. 

The Derivative of a Polynomial 6 
In the last chapter we described some algebra which arises in integrating. 
In this chapter we observe that differentiating can be done purely algebrai-
cally, and can give a partial criterion for deciding whether a polynomial 
has a repeated factor. Since we can differentiate without using limits, we 
can assume that the polynomials have coefficients in any field, not neces-
sarily the field of real numbers. 
Let F be a field, f(x) a polynomial with coefficients in F. Define 
D(f) = 1', another polynomial in F[x], by the two rules: 
(I) For a in F, n ~ 0, D(ax") = a(x,,-I + ... + X,,-I) (n times) = 
nax,,-I. 
This is a slightly misleading formula, for the exponent "n" in ax" is a 
nonnegative integer, whereas the coefficient "n" in nax,,-I denotes I + I 
+ ... + I (n times) in F. Thus if F = 71.3, D(x3) = 3x2 = ° 
since 3 = 0 
in 71.3' 
(2) D(f + g) = Df + Dg. 
These rules define the derivl;ltive l' of f for any polynomial f in F[ x]. 
Proposition. D(f· g) = fD(g) + D(f)g. 
This is the familiar product rule. 
SKETCH OF PROOF. By rule (2), if f = fl + f2' then D(fg) = D«(fl + fJg) = 
D(fl g + f2g) = D(fl g) + D(f2g). A similar result holds if g is a sum. Since 
any polynomial is a sum of terms of the form anx" for n ~ 0, it suffices to

Here is an algebraic reason for wanting the derivative of a polynomial. 
Theorem. Let j(x) be in F[x], where F is a jield contained in the complex 
numbers. Then j(x) has no multiple jactors ifj the greatest common divisor oj 
j and j' is 1. 
(Recall our comments about greatest common divisors of polynomials. 
The last phrase of the theorem means: "The only common divisors of j 
and l' are constants.") 
PROOF. Let j(x) = p(x)eq(x) with e> 1. Then 
1'(x) = p(xyq'(x) + ep(xy-Iq(X) = p(xY-\p(x)q'(x) + eq(x». 
Thus p(x)e-I is a nontrivial common divisor and j(x) and 1'(x) are not 
relatively prime. 
Conversely, if d(x) is the greatest common divisor of j(x) and1'(x) and 
has degree ;;;. 1, let p(x) be an irreducible factor of d(x). Then j(x) = 
p(x)g(x). So j'(x) = p'(x)g(x) + p(x)g'(x). Since p(x) is irreducible, p(x) 
divides p'(x) or g(x). 
Let p(x) = anxn + ... + alx + ao' Then p'(x) = nanxn- I + ... + al' 
Since n > 0 (which it must be if p(x) is irreducible) and F (;;; C, nan ":1= O. 
Thus p'(x) is a nonzero polynomial of degree less than that of p(x). 
Therefore p(x) cannot divide p'(x), and so p(x) divides g(x). 
Since p(x) divides g(x), g(x) = p(x)h(x) for some hex), and so j(x) = 
p(x)2h(x), andj(x) has a multiple factor. That completes the proof.

EXAMPLE. Let F= R Ifj(x) = X4 - 2x3 + 3x2 - 2x + 1, thenj'(x) = 4x3 -
6x 2 + 6x - 2, and (j(x),1'(x» = x 2 -
X + 1. Since x 2 - x + 1 is irreduc-
ible, it is a multiple factor of j(x), so necessarily j(x) = (x 2 - X + 1)2.

Sturm's Algorithm 
We discussed in Chapter 5 the technique of computing the integral of a 
rational function a(x)/ hex) where a(x), hex) are in lR[x] whenever the 
factorization of hex) can be found. Unfortunately there is no algebraic 
procedure for computing the factorization of a polynomial!(x) in lR[x] in 
general, and so the factorization of !(x) must be approximated. 
Finding the factorization of !(x) in lR[x] is equivalent to finding the 
roots of !(x) in C. To go very much into the techniques available for 
approximating the roots of a complex polynomial is beyond the scope of 
this book. You may wish to consult a book on numerical analysis, or 
Henrici (1974) or Dejon and Henrici (1969). 
We shall, however, look at a technique for finding the number of real 
roots of !(x) in lR[x] between any two given numbers. The result, Sturm's 
theorem, is a clever application of Euclid's algorithm. 
To make the argument easier, we first replace!(x) by g(x) = !(x)/ d(x), 
where d(x) is the greatest common divisor of !(x) and!'(x). Then g(x) has 
exactly the same roots as !(x), but each occurs in g(x) with multiplicity 1. 
We show this as follows. Suppose a is a root of !(x), !(x) = (x - a)ek(x) 
with k(a) =1= O. Then f'(x) = (x - ay-1h(x) with h(a) =1= 0, so d(x) 
= (x - ay- ](x) for some j(x) dividing hex); hence j(a) =1= o. Since j(a) =1= 
O,j(x) and x - a are relatively prime, so j(x) divides k(x), and !(x)/ d(x) 
=(x - a)k(x)/j(x). This means that if a is a root of !(x), then a is a root 
of g(x) = !(x)/ d(x) of multiplicity 1. Conversely, if a is a root of g(x), 
then, since g( x) divides!( x), a is a root of!( x), and thus is a root of g( x) of 
multiplicity 1. 
If we want to locate the roots of !(x), then, it is enough to locate the 
roots of g(x). Since g(x) has no mUltiple roots, g(x) and g'(x) are relatively 
prime by the theorem of Chapter 6. So when we apply Euclid's algorithm 

7 Sturm's Algorithm 
161 
to g(x) and g'(x) we end up with a constant polynomial as a final 
remainder. 
By replacingf(x) by g(x) if necessary, we shall assume through the rest 
of this chapter thatf(x) has no multiple roots. 
Sturm's algorithm works as follows. Write down the Euclidean algo-
rithm in the following slightly modified form: 
fo(x) = f(x), 
f,(x) = J'(x), 
fo(x) = q,(x)f,(x) - f2(X), 
f,(x) = q2(x)f2(X) - f3(X), 
j,._I(X) = qr(x)j,.~x) - o. 
Since (f(x),J'(x» = 1, f..(x) is a constant. 
Consider the sequence of functions 
£?P(x) = {Jo(x), f,(x), ... ,j,.(x)}. 
For a not a root of f(x) = fo(x), let w(a) be the number of changes of sign 
(omitting zeros) in the sequence £?P(a) = {fo(a),fl(a), ... ,j,.(a)}. 
Sturm's Theorem. If b < c and f( b) =1= 0, f( e) =1= 0, then the number of distinct 
roots of p(x) benveen band c is web) - wee). 
Application of Sturm's theorem is aided by the following exercise. 
tEl. Letf(x) = an + alx + ... + a,,_IX n- 1 + xn be a monic polynomial with real 
coefficients and let M be either I or laol + lall + ... +Ian-ll, which-
ever is larger. Show that all real roots of f(x) lie between - M an4 + M. 
EXAMPLE. Let f( x) = X4 + 2x3 + 3x2 + I-all roots are between - M and 
M where, by Exercise EI, M = 6. The modified Euclidean algorithm with 
f(x) andf'(x) gives the sequence of functions 
£?P(x) = 
X4 + 2x3 + 3x2 + I 
4x3 + 6x2 + 6x

Evaluated at - 6, these functions have the following signs: 
[+, -, -, +, +J. 

162 
7 Sturm's Algorithm 
Thus w( -6) = 2. Evaluated at 0, these functions have the following signs: 
[ +, 0, -, +, +]. 
Thus w(O) = 2. Evaluated at 6, these functions have the following signs: 
[+,+,-,-,+]. 
Thus w(6) = 2. It follows that w( - 6) - w(6) = 0 = the number of roots of 
f( x) between - 6 and 6. Since all roots must be between - 6 and 6, f( x) has 
no roots at all. 
(This can be checked by computing, by usual calculus techniques, that 
f(x) has a minimum at x = 0, and f(O) = 1, so f(x) > 0 for all x.) 
EXAMPLE. Let f(x) = x3 - 5x2 + 8x - 8. Then the sequence of functions 
CP (x) is 
[ 
X3 - 5x2 + 8x - 8] 
CP(x) = 
3x2 - lOx + 9 
. 
x + 16 
-1 
Here M=21. Evaluated at x= -21, the sequence of numbers CP(-21) 
has the following signs: [ -, +, -, -]. At x = 0, the sequence of numbers 
CP(O) has the signs [-, +, +, -]. At x = 21 the sequence of numbers 
CP(21) has the signs: [+, +, +, -]. Thus w(-21)=2, w(O) =2, w(21) 
= 1. This means that there is only one real root of f(x), and it lies between 
o and 21. We can then forget the sequence CP(x) and just observe that 
f(O) < 0, f(21) > 0, and somewhere in between it crosses the x-axis. We try 
some values of x: f(12) is + ,1(6) is +, f(3) is -, f(4) is +, so the root is 
between 3 and 4. To pin it down more precisely at this point one would use 
another technique, like Newton's method (which can be found in any 
calculus text). 
PROOF OF STIJRM'S THEOREM. Given a polynomial f(x) with no multiple 
roots, let CP(x) = [Jo(x),fl(x), ... ,J,.(x)] be the sequence of functions 
obtained by the modification of Euclid's algorithm. ThenJ,.(x), the greatest 
common divisor of f(x) andf'(x) , is a nonzero constant. 
In the interval between band c indicate all the points dl , ••• , ds which 
are roots of one or more offo(x),fl(x), ... ,J,._I(X),J,.(x). Note thatJ,.(x) is 
a constant =1= 0 so has no roots.

It may be that b or c is a root of some one or more of fl(x), ... ,J,.(x), but 
we assume that b and c are not roots of fo(x) .. 
Claim: d; cannot be a root of both.i(x) and.i+I(x) for some}. For if it 
were, then, since .i(x) = .i+I(X)lij+I(X) - .i+2(X),.i+2(d;) = 0; since .i+I(X) 
= .i+iX)lij+2(X) - .i+iX),.i+3(di) = 0; continuing in this way, we getJ,.(d;) 
= O. But j,.(x) is a nonzero constant. Thus the claim is true.

We shall consider how the function w(x), the number of changes in sign 
in the sequence of numbers 0> (x), changes as we move along the x-axis 
from left to right from b to c. 
First of all, if we let x vary within an interval between two consecutive 
d;'s then w(x) is constant. For suppose x' and x" are two numbers 
between, say, di - I and di• Then/l(x') and/l(x") must have the same sign, 
for each j. For otherwise they have opposite signs, and since /I(x) is a 
continuous function (being a polynomial), there must be some d between 
x' and x" where /I(d) = 0. But then d = dk for some k. Thus, if x', x" are 
both within an interval between two consecutive d/s, then the signs of the 
numbers in the sequence 
0>(X') = [fo(xl),f,(X'), ... ,J,.(X')] 
are the same as the signs of the corresponding numbers in the sequence 
0>(x") = [JO(XI),fI(X"), ... ,J,.(x")], 
and hence the number of changes in sign in the two sequences 0> (x') and 
0> (x") are equal, that is, w(X') = w(x"). 
So as we move along the x-axis between two consecutive d;'s, w(x) 
remains constant. 
Now we see what happens to w(x) when we move past some d;. So we 
look at x', x" as illustrated.

d;+, 
First suppose that d; is a root of fo(x). Then di is not a root of 
fl(x) = fo(x), by the argument above, in the third paragraph of the proof. 
Thus the following cases can arise. 
(i)jl(d;) is +. Thenf,(x) is + for all x between di - I and di+1 (at least) 
so fo(x) is increasing for x between d;-, and di+l. Since fo(di) = 0, fo(x') is 
- , while fo(x") is +, and the sequences of signs of 0> (x) start 
0>(X') =[-, +, ... ], 
0>(x") =[+, +, ... ]. 
(ii)f,(d;) is -. Thenf,(x) is - for all x between di _ 1 and di+ I' so fo(x) is 
decreasing for all x between d; _ I and d; + I. Since foe dJ = 0, foe x') is +, 
while fix ") is -, and the sequences of signs of 0> (x) start 
0>(x') =[+, -, ... ], 
0>(x") =[-, -, ... ]. 
In each of the two cases, the effect on w(x) is that w(x") = w(x') - 1: 
w(x) lowers by 1 in moving from left to right across a root of fo(x). 
Suppose d; is a root of /I(x), j > 0. Then di is not a root of /I-I(X) or of 
/I+I(X). SO the signs of /I-I(X) and/l+I(x) do not vary between di _ 1 and 
d;+,. Now 
so, in particular, at d;, where 1;(di ) = 0, 1;-,(d;) and 1;+ I(di) have opposite 

164 
7 Sturm's Algorithm 
signs. Thus J;-I(X) and J;+ lex) have opposite signs for all x between d;-l 
and d;+l. 
So 0'(x') and 0'(x") both either look like 
[ ... +,1, -, ... ] 
or like 
[ ... -, ?, +, ... ], 
where ? denotes the sign of J;. Whatever ? is (+, 0, or -) will not make 
any difference in computing w(x') or w(x"). 
Thus the fact that d; is a root of J;(x),j > 0, does not effect any change 
in w(x) as x moves from left to right across d;. 
The same argument holds in case dl = b or ds = c. If, for example, 
dl = b is a root of J;(x) for some j > 0, then for x" between dl and d2, the 
signs of J;-I(X") and of J;+I(X") will be the same as their signs at b = dl, 
and they will be opposite, so if 
0'(b) = [ ... +,0, -, ... ], 
then 
0'(x") = [ ... , +, ?, -, ... ], 
while if 
0' (b) = [ ... -, 0, +, ... ], 
then 
0'(x") = [ ... , -, ?, +, ... ] 
where? can be either + or -, it does not matter for computing w(x"). So 
in any case, w(x) is not changed in moving to the right away from b. The 
case ds = c is similar. 
To sum up, as we let x move from b to c, w(x) behaves as follows: 
the value of w(x) does not change on any interval containing no root of 
any J;(x); 
the value of w(x) is not affected in going past a point d; by the fact that 
d; is a root of J;(x), if j > 0; 
the value of w(x) decreases by 1 in going past a point d; which is a root 
of fo(x) = f(x); 
if b, c are not roots of fo(x), hence not roots of f(x), then the value of 
w(x) does not change on leaving b or arriving at c. 
Thus web) - w(c) = the number of points d; between band c which are 
roots of f(x), hence = the number of distinct roots of f(x) between band c. 
Sturm's theorem is proved.

Factoring in O[ x], I 
In Chapters 3 and 4 we determined all the irreducible polynomials with 
real or complex coefficients, and in Chapter 7 we made a start toward 
finding the real roots of a general polynomial in R[ x]. In this chapter we 
begin considering the question of which polynomials with coefficients in 
the rational numbers Q are irreducible, and how to find the rational roots, 
or more generally the irreducible factors, of a polynomial in Q[x]. 
The situation in Q[x] is different, as we shall see, from that in R[x] or 
C[x]. While in R[x] or C[x] we could describe explicitly all irreducible 
polynomials, we cannot do that in Q[x], but can only describe certain 
criteria which imply irreducibility. On the other hand, while we only took a 
first step (with Sturm's theorem) toward determining the factorization of a 
general polynomial in R[x], in Q[x] we shall eventually describe an explicit 
procedure (in fact, two different explicit procedures) for determining the 
factorization of any given polynomial in a finite number of steps. 
The starting point for all the results on Q[x] is the fact that factoring in 
Q[x] is "the same" as factoring in Z[x]. The first part of this chapter is 
devoted to showing that fact. 
A. Gauss's Lemma 
Let f(x) = anxn + . . . + alx + ao be a polynomial with rational 
coefficients an' ... , aI' ao. We can multiply f(x) by the least common 
denominator of the coefficients, call it s, and get a polynomial with integer 
coefficients, sf(x) = g(x). Since g(x) and f(x) are associates, g(x) will be 
irreducible in Q[x] if and only if f(x) is. So in studying polynomials in 
Q[x], we can always assume that they have integer coefficients. 

A Gauss's Lemma 
167 
We can ask for more. We shall say that a polynomialf(x) with rational 
coefficients is primitive if f(x) has integer coefficients and the greatest 
common divisor of those coefficients is 1. Then any polynomial with 
integer coefficients is an associate in Q[x] of a primitive polynomial. For if 
the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of f(x) is, say, t, then 
(l / t)f(x) is still a polynomial with integer coefficients, the greatest com-
mon divisor of the coefficients of (1/ t)f(x) is one (why?), and f(x) and 
(l/t)f(x) are associates in Q[x]. So any polynomial in Q[x] is an associate 
of a primitive polynomial. 
Lemma. The product of two primitive polynomials is again a primitive 
polynomial. 
PROOF. The product of any two polynomials with integer coefficients is 
again a polynomial with integer coefficients. We must check the primitiv-
ity. Let a(x) and b(x) be two primitive polynomials. Then for any prime p, 
p does not divide all the coefficients of a(x), and p does not divide all the 
coefficients of b(x). So 
a(x) ~ 0 (modp) and b(x) ~ 0 (modp). 
Then 
a(x)b(x) ~ 0 (modp), 
so p does not divide all the coefficients of a(x)b(x). Since this is true for 
any prime p, no prime divides all the coefficients of a(x)b(x), so the 
greatest common divisor of those coefficients is I, and a(x)b(x) is primi-
tive. 
D 
The main result of this section is 
Gauss's Lemma. Let f(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. If 
f(x) = a(x)b(x) in Q[x], then f(x) = a\(x)b\(x) with a\(x) and b\(x) poly-
nomials with integer coefficients, and with a\(x) and b\(x) associates of a(x) 
and b( x) respectively. 
Gauss's lemma implies that in order to show f(x) in l[x] is irreducible 
in O[x], it is enough to show thatf(x) does not factor into the product of 
two polynomials with integer coefficients. 
PROOF OF GAUSS'S LEMMA. If f(x) = a(x)b(x) in Q[x], then rf(x) = 
ra(x)b(x) for any rational number r. If the result is true for rf(x) it is true 
for f(x). So we can assume without loss of generality thatf(x) is a primitive 
polynomial. Now if f(x) = a(x)b(x), where a(x) and b(x) are polynomials 
with rational coefficients, then there are rational numbers s, t, such that 
sa(x) and tb(x) are primitive. (We showed above that any polynomial with 
rational coefficients is an associate of such a polynomial.) By the lemma, 
sta(x)b(x) = stf(x) is then a primitive polynomial. So is f(x).

El. If r is a rational number such that rf(x) andf(x) are both primitive polynomi-
als, show that r = I or - l. 
By Exercise EI, st = ± 1, so f(x} = ± sa(x}' tb(x}. We can set al(x} = 
± sa(x}, b1(x} = tb(x} to complete the proof of Gauss's lemma.

We shall say that a polynomial in Z[x] is irreducible in Z[x] if it does not 
factor into the product of two polynomials with degrees ~ 1 with integer 
coefficients. Gauss's lemma says that a polynomial with integer coefficients 
is irreducible in Z[x] if and only if it is irreducible as a polynomial in Q[x]. 
E2. Find a primitive polynomial which is an associate of 
(a) f(x) = (4/3)X4 + 6x3 + (2/9)x2 + (9/2)x + 18, 
(b) f(x) = 36x3 + 180x2 + 24x + 1/7. 
F.3. (a) Show: If fix) in l[x] is monic, it is primitive; 
(b) Show that if f(x) in l[x] is monic and factors as f(x) = g(x)h(x) with 
g(x), h(x) in C[x], then g(x), h(x) are associates of gl(X), h1(x) in l[x] which 
are monic and such thatf(x) = gl(x)h1(x). 
B. Finding Roots 
Here is a criterion for deciding whether a polynomial with integer 
coefficients has a linear factor. 
Theorem. If f(x} = anxn + ... + atX + ao is in Z[x] and x = r / s is a root, 
with r, s relatively prime integers, then s divides an and r divides ao' 
Note that if x = r / s is a root of f(x}, then sx - r is a factor of f(x}. 
PROOF. Suppose 0 = f(r / s} = an(rn / sn) + ... + at(r / s} + ao. Multiply 
through by sn. Then s must divide anrn, and since rand s are relatively 
prime, s must therefore divide an' Similarly, r must divide aas n ; for the 
same reason, r must divide ao. That completes the proof.

For example, the only possible roots of the polynomial X4 + 8x3 + 15x2 
- 6x - 9 are x = 1, -1,3, -3,9, or -9, since these are the only divisors 
of -9. 
Since an and ao each have only a finite number of divisors, the theorem 
limits the possible roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients to only a 
finite number. (See Exercise E6.)

c. Testing for Irreducibility 
169 
Finding roots is the same as finding factors of degree 1. A harder problem 
is to find all the factors of any degree of a polynomial with rational 
coefficients. The remainder of this chapter is an introduction to this 
problem. 
We begin with a criterion for proving that certain polynomials are 
irreducible. 
Theorem (Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion). If f(x) = anxn + an_1xn- 1 
+ ... + alx + ao is in Z[x], and there exists a prime p such that p does not 
divide an' p does divide an-I' an-2' ... , al and ao, but p2 does not divide ao, 
then f(x) is irreducible in Z[x] (and hence in Q[xD. 
This theorem shows that there are irreducible polynomials in Q[x] of 
any degree, for example, xn - 2. 
PROOF. Suppose f(x) = g(x)h(x) in Z[x], where g(x) = brxr + ... + blx 
+ bo, hex) = csxs + ... + clx + co. Multiplying together g(x) and hex) 
and equating coefficients with those of f(x), we get n + 1 equations 
(assume r .;;; s): 
a3 = b3Co + b2Cl + b1c2 + bOc3, 
a2 = b2cO + bici + bOc2, 
al = blco + bOc1, 
ao = boco· 

170 
8 Factoring in Q[x], I 
Since p2 does not divide ao, but p does, p divides bo but not co' or vice 
versa. Suppose p divides bo, and p does not divide Co. Then since p divides 
each of aI' a2, •.• ,ar , but not Co' P must divide b l , hence b2, hence 
b3, ••• , hence br. But then p divides an' which is impossible. The "vice 
versa" is similar. So the assumed factorization of f(x) cannot exist. 
D 
Eisenstein's criterion is very nice when it works, but there are many 
irreducible polynomials to which it does not apply. For example, consider 
p(x) = x 5 + 4X4 + 2x3 + 3x2 -
X + 5: Eisenstein's criterion is useless here, 
but p(x) may still be irreducible. How do we decide? 
One can try a "brute force" approach. 
If p(x) factors, it must factor into a(x)b(x), where a(x), b(x) are 
polynomials in Z[x] (by Gauss's lemma), where we can assume a(x) has 
degree 1 and b(x) has degree 4, or a(x) has degree 2 and b(x) degree 3. 
If a(x) has degree 1, thenp(x) has a rational root, so we can apply the 
theorem about such roots. Any root must divide 5, so must be 1, -1,5, or 
- 5. It is easy to check that none of these are roots of p(x). So p(x) has no 
linear factor in O[x]. 
To test the case where a(x) has degree 2, we write the potential 
factorization out, as in the proof of Eisenstein's criterion: 
x 5 + 4X4 + 2x3 + 3x2 -
X + 5 = (ax2 + bx + c)(dx3 + ex2 + fx + g) 
where a, b, c, d, e, J, g are integers. Multiplying out and equating 
coefficients, we get 
ad = 1, 
bd + ae = 4, 
be + cd + af = 2, 
ce + bf + ag = 3, 
cJ + bg = -1, 
cg = 5, 
which we try to solve. Since (by Gauss's lemma) all the variables are 
integers, there are only a few possible values of a, d, c and g, so there is a 
chance of finding all solutions of these equations. 
E7. Show the above set of equations has no solution. (See EI5.) 
This "brute force" technique is not so successful for polynomials of 
higher degree. Even on a polynomial of degree 9 or 10 the "brute force" 
approach gives a system of equations for the coefficients which is rather 
complicated and difficult to handle in a systematic way. So we look for 
other techniques. 
One test for irreducibility is to reduce mod n. If f(x) is a polynomial 
with integer coefficients which is primitive, then we can reduce the 
coefficients mod n for any n and get a nonzero polynomialj(x) in Zn[x]. If 

C Testing for Irreducibility 
171 
n is an integer which is relatively prime to the leading coefficient of f(x), 
then }(x) in Zn[x] has the same degree as f(x). 
So suppose f(x) = a(x)b(x), where a(x), b(x) have integer coefficients 
and are primitive. Then}(x) = a(x)b(x), in Zn[x], and soj(x) would factor. 
Therefore 
Corollary. If }(x) in Zn[x] is irreducible for some n not dividing the leading 
coefficient of f( x), then f( x) is irreducible in Q[ x]. 
Testing irreducibility of j(x) in Zn[x] is a finite problem, since there are 
only a finite number of possible divisors of j(x). 
For example, letf(x) = 3x5 -
4X4 + 2x3 + x 2 + 18x + 31; mod 2,f(x) is 
congruent to}(x) = x 5 + x 2 + 1. It is easy to check that}(x) has no roots in 
Z2; if we look for a possible factorization of the form 
j(x) = (ax 2 + bx + c)(dx3 + ex2 + fx + g) 
with a, b, ... , g in Z2' the equations for the coefficients are easily shown 
to be insolvable. Soj(x) is irreducible in Z2[X], and hencef(x) is irreduc-
ible in Q[ x]. 
The example of Exercise E7 can be shown irreducible in Z3[ x ]-see 
E15. 
In Chapters II and 13 we shall describe two techniques for systemati-
cally factoring a polynomial f(x) in Q[x]. One uses an analogue of the 
Chinese remainder theorem for poiynomials. The other involves factoring 
mod m. We shall look for a systematic way to factor polynomials mod m, 
and in particular look for irreducible polynomials in Zp[x].

Congruences Modulo a Polynomial 9 
Let F be a field, p(x) be a polynomial in F[x]. Say thatf(x) is congruent to 
g(x) modp(x), written 
f(x) == g(x) (modp(x)), 
if p(x) divides f(x) - g(x), that is, if f(x) and g(x) differ by a multiple of 
p(x). 
Congruence modp(x) has identical properties to congruence mod n of 
integers. If you go back to the chapter on congruences (Chapter 6) in Part 
I, all the facts about congruences obtained there remain valid for con-
gruences mod a polynomial. So we shall say no more, and just provide 
some exercises.

Fermat's Theorem, II 10 
A. The Characteristic of a Field 
Fermat's theorem says that if p is a prime number and a is any integer 
relatively prime to p, then aP - 1 == I (modp). In Chapter I-II we gave a 
proof based on the fact that the set of invertible elements of 7L.p forms an 
abelian group of order p - 1. In this chapter we give another proof based 
on the binomial theorem. We begin by making a definition which relates to 
the fact that in 7L.P' [p] = O. 
Let R be a commutative ring, with zero element 0 and identity element 
1. Add I to itself many times. Two possible situations can arise. One is that 
0* I + 1 + ... + 1 (n times) for any n > o. Then R is said to have 
characteristic O. Examples are Q, ~, C, 7L., ~[x]. 
The other situation is that there is some n > 0 such that 0 = 1 + 1 
+ ... + 1 (n times). This happens, for example, in 7L.2, for in 7L.2, 1 + I = 
[1h + [1h = [1 + Ih = [2h = [Oh = O. Similarly, for any m > 0, in 7L.m 1 + 1 
+ ... + 1 (m times) = O. 
Let no be the smallest natural number n for which 0 = 1 + 1 + . . . + 1 
(n times) in R. 
Proposition. If R has no zero divisors (in particular, if R is a field), then no is 
a prime number. 
PROOF. If no = ab, with a, b natural numbers less than no, then

(a times), 
and 
(b times), 
so R has zero divisors, which is impossible. So no must be prime. 
0 
To signify in the notation that no is prime, we shall relabel no and call it 
p. If R has no zero divisors, and if 
o = 1 + 1 + ... + 1 
(p times),p prime, 
then R is said to have characteristic p. 
For example, lLp has characteristic p. Thus lL2 has characteristic 2, lL3 
has characteristic 3, etc. Similarly, lLp[x] has characteristic p. 
El. Show that if R has characteristic p and 0 = 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (n times) for 
n > 0, then pin. 
E2. Show that if R has characteristic p and a is in R, then pa = a + a + . . . + a 
(p times) = O. 
B. Applications of the Binomial Theorem 
Recall the binomial theorem, Chapter 1-2: if (~) = n!j r!(n - r)! for 0 ..;; r 
..;; n, O! = 1, then ( ~) is an integer for each n, r, and for any indeterminates 
x,y, 
(x + yr = (~)xn + (7)zn-y + (~)xn-2 y2 + ... + 
(~)xn-Y' + ... + (:_I)xyn-1 + (~)yn. 
Lemma. If p is prime, then p divides (~) for all r, 0 < r <po 
PROOF. For p prime, (~) = p!jr!(p - r)!. Now r!(p - r)! divides p! since 
(~) is an integer. Since (p, r!(p - r)!) = 1 for 1..;; r ..;; p - 1, therefore 
r!(p - r)! divides (p - I)! and 
( p) = p( (p - I)! ) 
r 
r! (p - r)! ' 
an integer multiple of p.

Corollary. If p is prime, (x + y)P =xp + yP (modp).

PROOF. Expand (x + YY by the binomial theorem and use the lemma. 
D 
We shall use this corollary to reprove Fermat's theorem. 
Fermat's Theorem. If p is prime, then for a~ integer a, aP == a (mod p). 
Note. If we show that for any integer a, aP =a (modp), then, if fl andp 
are relatively prime, we can cancel a from both sides to get Fermat's 
theorem as stated in Chapter 1-11. 
PROOF. If we prove aP ==a (mod p) when a is a natural number, then 
aP ==a (modp) for a any integer. For any integer a is congruent modp to 
some natural number b; if bP ==b (modp), then 
aP = 
bP == b == a (modp) 
and the theorem is true for the integer a. 
So it suffices to prove the theorem when a is a natural number. We 
proceed by induction on a. 
For a = 1 it is clear. Suppose a is an integer ;;> 1 for which aP ==a 
(modp). Consider (a + 1Y. By the corollary, (a + 1Y ==aP + lP (modp). 
By induction, this is congruent to a + 1 (modp). That completes the 
induction step and proves the theorem. 
D 
If you review the old proof of Fermat's theorem it will be apparent that 
the old proof and the one we just gave are very different. The old proof 
was a special case of a result about finite groups, while the new one 
involves knowing about the binomial theorem mod p. By the ideas of the 
old proof we were able to prove Euler's theorem, i.e., that if (a, m) = 1 
then a4>(m) == 1 (mod m). In Chapter 1-14, Exercise E15, we showed how to 
use Fermat's theorem and the Chinese remainder theorem to deduce a 
proof of Euler's theorem for m squarefree; but to get Euler's theorem for m 
a prime power by the ideas of the proof we just gave of Fermat's theorem 
would be difficult. 
On the other hand, the corollary to the binomial theorem which we 
obtained above has other useful applications to finite fields. We first 
extend the corollary to elements of arbitrary fields of characteristic p. (The 
corollary as stated above only applies to integers modp.) 
Theorem 1. If R is a field of characteristic p and a, b are elements of R, then 
(a + by = aP + bP• 
PROOF. By the binomial theorem, for y, z any indeterminates, (y + zY = 
yP+(~)yP-1 + ... +(~)yp-rzr+ ... +(P~I)yP-IZ+ZP. Set y= 
a, z = b, a, bin R. Now if r¥=O or p, (~) = pq for some q, by the lemma, 
so (~)ab = q(p. ab) = 0 by Exercise E2. Thus in R, (a + by = aP + 0 
+ . . . + 0 + . . . + 0 + bP , as was to be proved.

E3. In GF(9), verify that (1 + 2i? + (2 + 2i)3 = (1 + 2i + 2 + 2i)3. 
The next result is an extension of the theorem of Chapter 6 relating the 
derivative of a polynomial and multiple factors. We had assumed in that 
theorem that the polynomials had coefficients in a subfield of the complex 
numbers. 
E4. Show that the proof of that theorem was valid if F had characteristic O. 
Theorem 2. If f(x) is in F[x], where F is a finite field of characteristic p, then 
f(x) has no multiple factor if and only if (f(x),f'(x» = 1. 
Before reading the proof of Theorem 2 you may wish to review the 
proof of the theorem of Chapter 6 to see how it went-the proof here 
begins the same way. 
PROOF. If F is any field and (f(x), f'(x» = 1, then by Chapter 6, Exercise 
E4, f has no multiple roots. 
Conversely, suppose hex) is an irreducible common factor of f(x) and 
f'(x). Thenf= hg,f' = hg' + h'g. Since h dividesf', h divides hg'. Since h 
is irreducible, h divides g or h divides h'. If h divides g, h is a multiple 
factor of f, and the theorem is proved. So we suppose the other possibility, 
that h divides h', and derive a contradiction. 
How can h divide h'? Since deg h' < deg h, this can happen only when 
h' = O. Now it is easily checked that if h' = 0, then 
h(x) = ao + alxP + a2x 2p + ... + arxrp. 
(1) 
We show that if hex) has the form (1), then hex) cannot be irreducible. 
That will be a contradiction. 
We begin by showing that each aj is a pth power. To do this, define a 
function <Pp from F to F by setting <p/b) = bP for each element b of F. We 
want to show that every element of F is in the image of <pp. To do this it 
suffices to show that <Pp is 1-1. For then the image of <Pp would have just as 
many elements as F, and since the image of <Pp is a subset of F and F is a 
finite set, the image of <Pp must be all of F. To show <Pp is 1-1, we suppose 
that <p/bj) = <P/b2) and we must show bl = b2• If <pp(b l ) = <pp(b2), then 
bf = bf, so bf - bf = O. But then (b l -
b~ = 0 by Theorem 1; since F is a 
field, it follows that bl - b2 = 0, so bl = b2 and <Pp is 1-1. 
Thus each element of F is in the image of <pp. In particular, each 
coefficient of hex) can be written as aj = cf = <p/Cj) for some Cj in F, so 
hex) = cg + cfxP + ... + c;xrp. By Theorem 1 again, we can write this as 
h(x) = (co + clx + ... + crxry. 
But then hex) is not irreducible, which is a contradiction. So hex) does not 
have the form (1), h'(x) cannot be 0, and hex) does not divide h'(x). Thus h 
divides g, h2 divides f, and the theorem is proved.

Factoring in Q[ x], II: Lagrange 
Interpolation 
A. The Chinese Remainder Theorem 
In Chapter 8 we showed that when factoring a polynomial with integer 
coefficients we can always assume the factors have integer coefficients. In 
this chapter we use that information to describe a systematic procedure for 
factoring polynomials in Ji'[x]. The method is attributed to Kronecker 
c. 1883, but is apparently due originally to F. v. Schubert, 1793. It is based 
on the Chinese remainder theorem, so we begin by considering how that 
theorem works in K[ x], K any field. 
Chinese Remainder Theorem for Polynomials. Let K be a field. Let 
alex), ... , an(x) be arbitrary polynomials, and m,(x), ... , mn(x) pairwise 
relatively prime polynomials in K[x]. Then there exists a unique polynomial 
f(x) in K[x] such that 
(*) 
f(x) == an(x) (mod mn(x)), 
and the degree of f(x) is < the degree of m,(x)mix) ... mn(x). 
PROOF. The proof of this theorem is virtually identical to the Chinese 
remainder theorem for integers. It goes as follows. Since m;(x) is relatively 
prime to m.;(x) for j * i, m;(x) is relatively prime to the product 
l;(x) = m,(x)mzCx) ... m;_,(x)mi+'(x) ... mn(x). 
Thus we can solve the equation 
1 = h;(x)m;(x) + k;(x)/;(x) 

B The Method of Lagrange Interpolation 
for hj and kj by Bezout's lemma. Then kj(x)lj(x) satisfies 
kj{x)l;(x) == ° 
(mod m.;{x») for all j ± i, 
kj{x)lj{x) == 1 (mod mj{x». 
So we solve (*) by setting 
181 
f{x) = a\{x)k\{x)l\{x) + aix)k2{x)12{x) + ... + an{x)kn{x)ln{x). 
If f(x) has degree ;;;. deg(m\(x) ... mn(x» we can use the division 
theorem to replace f(x) by r(x) = f(x) - q(x)[m\(x) ... m,,(x)], where the 
degree of r(x) can be made less than the degree of m\(x) ... mn(x).

The Chinese remainder theorem has a different interpretation if we 
apply the root theorem (Chapter 2) in the following form. 
El. Let g(x) be a polynomial with coefficients in a field F. Show that g(x) =b 
(mod[x - aJ) if and only if g(a) = b. 
Using Exercise El, we may let mj(x) = x - nj in the Chinese remainder 
theorem and deduce 
Corollary. If no, ... , nd are distinct integers and so' ... , Sd are arbitrary 
integers, there exists a unique polynomial q(x) in Q[x] of degree ..;; d such 
that q(n) = S; for i = 0, ... ,d. 
We shall show how to write down such a q(x) explicitly in Exercise E3 
below. 
B. The Method of Lagrange Interpolation 
We describe in this section the systematic method of factoring any poly-
nomialf(x) in Z[x]. 
First note that if f( x) in Z[ x] of degree n is not irreducible it has a factor 
of degree";; n12. So let d = nl2 if n is even, d = (n - 1)/2 if n is odd. 
Let no, ... , nd be distinct integers, and let p(no) = ro, ... ,p(nd) = rd' 
Since p(x) is in Z[x], '0"'" 'd are integers. For each vector s = 
(so, ... , Sd) of integers which are divisors of (ro, ... , rd) (that is, sjlrj for 
all i, i = 0, . . . , d), use the corollary to the Chinese remainder theorem to 
get a unique polynomial as<x) in Q[x] of degree";; d with as(n;) = Sj for all 
i. Since each rj has only a finite number of (positive or negative) divisors Sj' 
there are only a finite number of possible vectors s = (so' ... ,Sd) and 
hence only a finite number of corresponding polynomials as(x), one for 
each of the possible vectors s. 
It turns out that any divisor of p(x) in Z[x] of degree";; d is an as(x) for 
some s. For suppose a(x) is in Z[x] of degree";; d and a(x)b(x) = p(x) for 

182 
I I Factoring in Q[x], II: Lagrange Interpolation 
some b(x) in Z[x]. Then for each n;, a(n;)b(n;) = p(n;) in Z, so a(n;) divides 
p(n;) = riO Thus the vector s = (a(no), ... , a(nd» is a vector of divisors of 
(ro' rl , ••• , rd). The Chinese remainder theorem gives a unique polynomial 
as(x) of degree ~ d with aino) = a(no), as(n l ) = a(n l ), ••• , as(nd) = a(nd). 
Since a(x) and as(x) both have degree ~ d and have the same value on 
d + I elements of iQ, they must be equal (for their difference has degree 
~ d and has d + I roots, so must = 0). We conclude that any divisor a(x) 
of p(x) of degree ~ d must be among the finite number of polynomials 
aix) constructed corresponding to the finite number of vectors s of 
divisors of (ro, r l , ••• , rd). 
To determine, then, whether p(x) is irreducible or not in Z[x], divide 
p(x) by each of the polynomials as(x) to see whether a.(x) is a divisor of 
p(x). If some aix) of degree ;> I divides p(x), then an explicit factoriza-
tion of p(x) has been found. Otherwise, p(x) must be irreducible. 
An easy argument by induction on the degree of p(x) then gives 
Theorem. The complete factorization of any polynomial in Z[ x] can be 
achieved in a finite number of steps. 
El. Fill in the details of the induction argument for the proof of the theorem. 
We call the polynomial as(x) a Lagrange interpolator. It is constructed as 
follows. 
With no, ... , nd' so' ... , Sd as above, let 
g(x) = (x - no) ... (x - nd)' 
and let g'(x) be its derivative. Then g(x)/(x - n;), after canceling, is a 
polynomial of degree d, so g(x)/(x - n;)g'(n;) = h;(x) is a polynomial of 
degree d such that 
h;(n;) = I and h;(no) = ... = h;(n;_I) = h;(n;+I) ... = h;(ns ) = O. 
E3. Show that (a) h;(n;) = 1, (b) a(x) = ho(x)so + ... + hd(x)Sd satisfies a(nj) = Sj 
for i = 0, ... , d, so that a(x) = a.(x). 
Here is an example to illustrate how the factoring method works. Let 
f(x) = X4 + X + 1. If f(x) factors it must have a factor of degree ~ 2. (Of 
course reducing mod 2 we already know it is irreducible!) Now f( -I) = 1, 
f(O) = I, f(1) = 3. For each s = (SI' so' SI) dividing (1, 1,3), the correspond-
ing Lagrange interpolator a.(x) is by E3,

If X4 + X + 1 factors we can assume all factors have integer coefficients 
and are primitive. Since X4 + x + 1 is monic, the leading coefficients of any 
such factors must be ± l. Now eight of the a.(x) are primitive but do not 
have leading coefficient ± 1, so cannot be factors. Two more as(x) are 
uninteresting since they have degree O. So only six of the as(x) must be 
checked as possible factors of X4 + x + 1: 
x 2 + X + I; 
x 2 + x-I; 
x 2 - x-I; 
-x2 - x-I; 
-x2 -
X + 1; 
-x2 + X + l. 
Since the three on the right are associates of the three on the left, we 
need only check the three on the left. Three quick divisions show that none 
are factors. 
Notice that the number of possible factors as(x) of f(x) depends on d 
(= 1/2 degf) but, more significantly, also depends on the number of 
divisors of f(nJ. The number of possible factors in the example we just did 
was kept small by the fact thatf(1) = f(O) = 1, which has only two factors 
in 71. In general one is not so fortunate, and the number of a.(x) can 
become unpleasantly large (see E7). A more efficient method of factoring 
has been developed in recent years which is based on factoring mod M for 
an appropriate number M. We shall examine this newer method in 
Chapter 13.

Factoring in Zp[x] 12 
Factoring in Zp[x], p prime, is interesting, not only for its own sake, but 
also because it is useful for factoring in Z[x]. See Chapters 8 and 13. For 
example, x4 + 3x + 7 can be shown to be irreducible in Z[x] (and therefore 
in lQi[xD by showing that it is irreducible mod 2. For if X4 + 3x + 7 = 
a(x)b(x) then a(x)b(x) can be chosen in Z[x]; then X4 + 3x + 7 =a(x)b(x) 
(mod 2) and X4 + 3x + 7 would factor mod 2. But mod 2, X4 + 3x + 7 = X4 
+ X + 1, which is easily shown to be irreducible in Z2[X]. 
Any polynomial of degree din Zp[x] can be factored in a finite number 
of steps, because there are only finitely many possible polynomials of 
degree < din Zp (pd, of them, to be precise), and we can simply check 
them all, using the division theorem. (In fact we need only look for factors 
of degree « d /2.) This trial and error approach is very inefficient, how-
ever. 
In this chapter we present an efficient algorithm for factoring polynomi-
als in Zp[x]. It was discovered in 1967 by E. R. Berlekamp (see Berlekamp 
(1967». 
The strategy of Berlekamp's method of factoring a polynomial f(x) in 
IZ:'p[x] is to translate the problem into that of solving a system of linear 
equations with coefficients in Zp' and finding greatest common divisors 
(g.c.d.s). There are very efficient computational methods for doing both 
problems (row operations and Euclid's algorithm, respectively), so such a 
translation is a very desirable one. 
The idea behind the algorithm is as follows. Suppose f(x) has degree d, 
and suppose somehow we can find a polynomial g(x) in Z/x) of degree 
> 1 and < d such thatf(x) divides g(xy - g(x). Note that if deg(g(x» = e 
> 1, g(xy - g(x) ~ 0, for the coefficient of x pe is nonzero. By Fermat's 
theorem the polynomial uP -
u has p roots in Zp' namely u = 

186 
12 Factoring in Zp[xJ 
0, 1,2, ... ,p - 1. Thus uP - u factors modp into uP -
U = u(u - 1)(u-
2) ... (u - (p - 1». Setting u = g(x), we get that 
g(xY' - g(x) = g(x)(g(x) - 1)(g(x) - 2) ... (g(x) - (p -1)) (1) 
in lAx]. Now observe the following. 
El. If a, b are relatively prime polynomials in F[x], F a field, and f is in F[x], 
prove that g.c.d.(j, ab) = g.c.d.(J, a)· g.c.d.(j, b). 
Since f(x) divides g(x)P - g(x), f(x) is the greatest common divisor of 
f(x) and g(x)P - g(x). Since g(x) - r and g(x) - s are relatively prime if 
r=l=s, we have by (1) and Exercise El that 
f(x) = g.c.d. (j(x), g(xy - g(x) 
p-I 
= II g.c.d. (f(x), g(x) - k) 
(2) 
k=O 
Each factor on the right side has degree at most that of g(x), which is in 
turn < d, the degree of f(x). Thus there must be at least two nontrivial 
factors of f(x) on the right-hand side of (2), that is, at least two factors of f 
which have degree ~ 1, and (2) is a nontrivial factorization of f(x). 
We have proved the first part of Berlekamp's theory: 
Theorem 1. Givenf(x) in lp[x] of degree d, let g(x) in lp[x] be a polynomial 
of degree ~ 1 and < d such that f(x) divides g(x)P - g(x). Then 
f(x) = g.c.d. (j(x), g(x)) 
·g.c.d. (f(x), g(x) - I) ... g.c.d. (f(x), g(x) - (p - 1)) 
is a nontrivial factorization of f(x). 
To factor f(x), then, we must find a polynomial g(x) such that f(x) 
divides g(x)P - g(x). This is done by solving a set of linear equations for 
the coefficients of g(x). We now obtain these equations. 
Suppose g(x) = bo + blx + ... + bd_IXd-', where bo, ... , bd- I are 
coefficients to be determined. To see whether f(x) divides g(x)P - g(x) we 
first look at g(x)p' By Theorem 1 of Chapter 11-10, 
g(xY' = bG + bfxP + ... + bS_,X(d-l)p. 
By Fermat's theorem, applied to each of bo, bl' ... , bd-" we have 
bf = bi in lp for all i, so 
g(xY' = bo + b,xP + b2x2p + ... +bd_,X(d-l)p. 
(3) 
Now use the division theorem: divide f(x) into xip for i = 0, 1,2, ... , 
d-l, to get 
(4) 

12 Factoring in lp[xJ 
187 
where 
r;(x) = ri,o + ri,lx + ri,2x2 + ... + ri,d_Ixd-1 
(5) 
Substituting (4) into (3), we get 
g(xy = boro(x) + blrl(x) + ... + bd_lrd_l(x) + (multiple off(x». 
Thusf(x) divides g(xy - g(x) if and only if f(x) divides the polynomial 
boro(x) + blrl(x) + ... + bd_Ird_l(x) - (bo + blx + ... + bd_IXd- I). 
But this polynomial has degree ..;; d - 1, hence is divisible by f(x) (of 
degree d) if and only if it is = O. 
Thils f(x) divides g(xy - g(x) if and only if the coefficients bo, ... , bd 
of g(x) satisfy 
boro(x) + blrl(x) + ... + bd_Ird_I(X) 
- (bo + blx + ... + bd_IXd- l) = o. 
(6) 
Collecting coefficients qf 1, X, x 2, ••• ,Xd - I in (6), we get d simulta-
neous linear equations in the d unknowns bo, bl' ... ,bd - I • We solve them 
for bo, ... , bd - I and get the coefficients of a polynomial g(x) such that 
f(x) divides g(xy - g(x). 
At this point it is convenient to use matrix notation, to put equation (6) 
into matrix form. Let I denote the d X d identity matrix,

1=

be the matrix whose rows are the coefficients of the remainder polynomials 
ro(x), ... ,rd_l(x), as in (5). Then it is easily verified that 
(bo, bl , ... , bd -,) is a solution l)f (6) if and only if 
(bo,' .. , bd-I)(Q - I) = (0, ... ,0). 
(7) 
Combining all this with Theorem 1 we get 
Theorem 2 (Berlekamp's Factoring Algorithm). To find a nontrivial factori-
zation of f(x) in Zp[x] of degree d, find the matrix Q and find a solution

To find g(x) = bo + blx + b2x2 + b3X3 + b4x 4 + bsxs, we solve b(Q -I) = 
0, or: 
b3 = 0; 
bl + b3 + b4 = 0; 
bl + b2 + b3 = 0; 
bs = 0; 
b2 + b3 + b4 = 0; 
b3 + bs = O.

This reduces quickly to b3 = b5 = 0, bl = b2 = b4. The only solutions with 
deg(g(x)) ~ 1 are g(x) = bo + x + x 2 + X4 with bo = 0 or 1. For either 
choice of bo, 
g(X)2 - g(x) = x 8 + X = f(x)· (x2 + x). 
Thus 
f(x) = g.c.d. U(x), X4 + x 2 + x)· g.c.d. U(x), X4 + x 2 + X + 1). 
It is easy to check that the left factor of the right side, g.c.d.(f(x), X4 + x 2 
+ x), is x 3 + X + 1, and the right factor is x 3 + x 2 + X + 1, and both are 
irreducible, so the factorization of f(x) into a product of irreducible 
polynomials in Z2[ x] is 
Using some ideas of linear algebra (see Chapter 1-9) we can actually 
count the number of distinct irreducible factors of f(x). For the rest of this 
chapter (except for the exercises) we shall assume knowledge of Chapter 
1-9. 
Let N be the set of vectors b = (bo, bl , ... ,bd _ l ) with b(Q - I) = O. 
Then N is called the null space of Q -I. Let {VI' v2, v3, ••• , vr } be a set of 
vectors in N such that every vector b in N is a linear combination of 
VI' ..• ,vr : for any b in N there are XI' .•• ,xr in Zp with b = XlVI 
+ ... +xrvr. The smallest r for which such a set {VI' v2, ••• , vr } exists is 
called the dimension of N. 
We observe that the vector b = (a, 0, ... , 0) is always a solution of 
b(Q - I) = 0, since g(xy - g(x) = 0 when g(x) is the constant polynomial 
a. If the only solutions of b(Q - I) = 0 are of the form b = (a, 0, ... , 0), 
then the dimension of N is 1, for every vector in the null space of Q - I is 
a multiple of VI = (1,0, ... , 0). To factor f(x) we need to find some other 
vector b = (bo, •.. , bd _ l ) with b(Q - I) = o. 
We have the following information: 
Theorem 3. (a) The dimension of the null space of Q - I = the number of 
distinct irreducible factors of f(x). (b) f(x) is irreducible in Zp[x] iff the null 
space ofQ - I has dimension 1 andf(x) and its derivativef'(x) are relatively 
prime. 
The dimension of the null space can be computed in the following way. 
Since Q - I is a d X d matrix, the dimension of the null space of Q - I 
can be computed as d minus the row or column rank of Q - I. The column 
rank of Q - I is equal to the number of nonzero columns after doing 
column operations on Q - I to get it into echelon form. To illustrate with 
Q - I as in the last example, a series of column operations puts Q - I into 

190 
echelon form as follows:

(4) is adding the third column to the fourth and sixth, and adding the fifth 
column to the sixth column, 
(5) is adding the third column to each of the first two and interchanging 
the fourth and fifth. 
Since the resulting matrix has 4 nonzero columns, the null space has 
dimension 6 - 4 = 2. In fact, a basis of the null space can be obtained by 
solving bE = O. (Doing column operations to Q - I corresponds to doing 
manipulations to the equation b(Q - I) = 0, manipulations which do not 
change the set of solutions of b(Q - I) = 0 and lead to the simpler 
equations bE = 0.) In solving bE = 0, bo and b4 may be chosen arbitrarily, 
and, once chosen, determine any solution b uniquely. The solutions to 
bE = 0 have the form: 
(bo, bl , b2, b3, b4, bs) = (bo, b4, b4, 0, b4, 0) 
= bo(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) + biO, 1, 1, 0, I, 0). 
We chose b4 = 1 above. 
PROOF OF THEOREM 3(a). Suppose f(x) has k distinct irreducible factors, 
f(x) = m_I(Pi(X»", where Pj(x) is irreducible, and suppose f(x) divides 
g(x)P - g(x) for some g(x). If f(x) divides g(x)P - g(x) = II~:J(g(x) - s), 

12 Factoring in Zp[X] 
191 
then each irreducible factor Pi(X) divides g(x) - S for some s, and, since 
g(x) - sand g(x) -
t are relatively prime for s =l=t, the s for which Pi(X) 
divides g(x) - s is uniquely determined by Pi(X)-Pi(X) cannot divide both 
g(x) - sand g(x) - t for s =1= t. 
Denote the unique s, 0..; s ..; P - I, such 
that Pi (x) divides g(x) - s, by Si' 
To g(x), then, corresponds the vector (Sl' ... ,Sk) of elements of 7Lp-
This defines a function from the set of polynomials g(x) withf(x) dividing 
g(xy - g(x), to the set of k-tuples (SI' ... , Sk) of elements of 7Lp• 
Now we define the inverse map. 
By the Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials (Chapter II), given 
any SI' •.. , Sk (not necessarily distinct) in 7Lp there is a unique polynomial 
g(x) of degree < d with 
g(x) == Si (modpi(x)"), 
that is, plx),' divides g(x) - Si' For such a g(x), then, Pi(X)", for each i, 
i = I, ... ,k, divides IIf:J(g(x) - s) = g(xy - g(x). Thereforef(x) = m=1 
p;(x),' divides g(xy - g(x). Thus given (SI' ... , sk) we have obtained g(x) 
of degree < d such thatf(x) divides g(xy - g(x). This is the inverse of the 
map constructed in the first paragraph of the proof. 
Thus we have a I-I correspondence between polynomials g(x) of 
degree < d withf(x) dividing g(xy - g(x), and k-tuples of elements of 7Lp' 
where k is the number of distinct irreducible factors of f(x). Since there are 
pk such k-tuples, there must be pk possible g(x). 
Now there is a I-I correspondence between vectors in the null space of 
Q - I and polynomials g(x) of degree < d with f(x) dividing g(xy 
- g(x) given by corresponding the polynomial g(x) = bo + blx + ... 
+ bd_IX d- 1 with the row vector (bo, bl , ... ,bd- I), as in Theorem 2. Thus 
there are P k vectors in the null space of Q - I, and so by Exercise E2 
(below) the null space of Q - I has dimension k. Since k was the number 
of distinct irreducible factors of f(x), the proof of part (a) is complete. 
E2. If V is a vector space of dimension k over a field with q elements, prove that V 
has qk elements. 
PROOF OF THEOREM 3(b). From (a), the null space of Q - I is one-dimen-
sional iff f(x) = p(x)', a power of an irreducible polynomial. Then r = I 
and f(x) is irreducible iff f(x) and f'(x) are relatively prime. That com-
pletes the proof of Theorem 3.

EXAMPLE. How many distinct irreducible factors divide f(x) = x 5 + 2X4 + 
x3 + x2 + 2 in 7L3[X]? We compute Q - I: 
1 = f(x)O + I; 
x 3 = f(x)O + x 3; 
x 6 = f(x)(x + I) + I + x + 2X2 + x 3; 
x 9 = f(x)(x4 + x 3 + x) + x; 
Xl2 = f(x)(x7 + x 6 + x 4) + X4.

Factoring in O[ x], III: mod M 13 
One of the best methods currently available for factoring a polynomial 
with integer coefficients is to factor it mod M for M a large number and 
then try to "lift" the factorization back to one in Z[ x]. 
We can assumef(x) is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. For 
if f(x) has leading coefficient a, replacing x by x/a and multiplying the 
resulting polynomial by a n - 1 gives a monic polynomial with integer 
coefficients g(x) whose factorization problem is the same as that of f(x). 
For example, to factor f(x) = 6x2 + 5x + 1, factor g(x) = 6(6(x/6f + 
5(x/6) + 1) = x 2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2); then f(x) factors into (1/6) 
(6x + 3)(6x + 2). 
Given f(x) monic with integer coefficients, the strategy is to factor f(x) 
mod M, where M is some number which is larger than twice the absolute 
values of the coefficients of all possible factors of f(x). The reason is the 
following. 
In general, if f(x) :::::g(x)h(x) (mod m) and m is small, there may be 
many ways this factorization could lift to one of f(x). For example, 
consider 
f(x) = x 5 + 17x4 - 5x3 -
277x2 + 144. 
Modulo 5, f(x) factors as 
f(x) ::::: (x3 + 3x + 2)(x2 + 2x + 2) (mod 5). 
But there are many polynomials which are congruent to x 2 + 2x + 2 
(mod 5) which could possibly be factors of f(x), such as x 2 + 2x - 3, x 2 + 
7x - 3, x 2 - 3x + 2, x 2 - 13x - 3, x 2 + 17x - 8, etc., and it would take 
some effort to discover thatf(x) factors in Z[x] as 
f(x) = (x3 - 17x + 12)(x2 + 17x + 12). 

194 
13 Factoring in Q[xJ. III: mod M 
However, supposeJ(x) =g(x)h(x) (mod M), where g(x) and hex) are in 
Z[x], and suppose we know that the coefficients of any possible factor of 
J(x) of degree that of g(x) must be in absolute value < M /2. Suppose we 
choose g(x) so that each of its coefficients is > - M /2 and <;; M /2. 
Suppose f(x) = G(x)H(x) in Z[x], where G(x) =g(x) (mod M) and H(x) 
=h(x) (mod M). Then it must be that G(x) = g(x). For if G(x) =g(x) 
(mod M), then either G(x) = g(x) or there is a coefficient of G(x) which 
differs from the corresponding coefficient of g(x) by a nonzero multiple of 
M. But then that coefficient of G(x) must be in absolute value ;> M /2, 
and is therefore too big in absolute value to qualify G(x) as a possible 
factor of f(x). 
Thus if f(x) =g(x)h(x) (mod M), then either g(x) divides f(x) in a[x] 
or the factorizationf(x) =g(x)h(x) (mod M) corresponds to no faetoriza-
tion in Z[ x] at all. 
To factor f(x) in Z[x], then, we want to find a suitably large M, and 
find all the factorizations of f(x) modulo that M. 
A. Bounding the Coefficients of Factors of a 
Polynomial 
Suppose f(x) in Z[x] is monic, of degree n. Let g(x) be a factor of f(x), 
which we can assume is also monic and has integer coefficients. 
Proposition 1. Suppose all complex roots of f(x) are in absolute value less 
than some positive real number R. If g(x) is a factor of f(x), of degree r, then 
all the coefficients of

absolute value at most 
max{(nRklk = 1,2, ... , rJ. 
PROOF. Let g(x) = xr + br_,xr-' + ... + b,x + bo, and in C[x] let g(x) 
= II~_,(x + Si) (where - s,' ... , - Sr are the roots of g(x) in the complex 
numbers).

coefficients, we get

According to Proposition 1, in order to find a good bound on the 
coefficients of factors of f(x) we must find a good bound on the roots of 
f(x). We know from Exercise E4, Chapter 4 that if f(x) = xn + an_IX n - 1

B. Factoring Modulo High Powers of Primes 
The strategy of factoring a polynomial in Z[x] by factoring mod M 
described at the beginning of this chapter requires only that M be 
sufficiently large. In this section we show how to factor mod M where 
M = p2N. The idea is to "lift" factorizations mod a prime p (which can be 
small) to factorizations mod p2, then mod p4, p8, p16, .... This lifting 
rapidly gives factorizations modulo numbers as large as one needs. 
To get started, i.e., factor mod p, one can use trial and error, or use 
Berlekamp's algorithm of Chapter 12. 
Henceforth we drop "(x)" inj(x). 
First a definition. 
If q is any natural number and g, h are polynomials with coefficients in 
Z, g and h are called relatively prime mod q if there are polynomials rand 
s in Z[x] such that rg + sh == 1 (mod q). 
Here is the theorem which tells how to lift factorizations. 
Theorem. Suppose j is a monic polynomial in Z[x] and j ==g,h, (mod q) 
where gl and hi are monic and relatively prime mod q. Then there are monic 
polynomials g2' h2 in Z[x] with g2 ==gl (mod q), h2 ==hl (mod q), such that 
j ==g2h2 (mod q2) and g2 and h2 are relatively prime mod q2. The polynomi-
als g2 and h2 are unique mod l· 
PROOF. We use the following subscript convention: a subscript ( )1 denotes 
a polynomial with integer coefficients whose coefficients are defined 
uniquely only mod q. For example, if j = 17 x 2 + 3x + 8, then 17 x 2 - 3x + 
8 == (l7x - 3)(x + 2) (mod 2). Soj==g,h, (mod 2), where we could choose 
gl == 17x - 3, hi = X + 2, but we could also choose gl = x + I, hi = x. On 
the other hand, a subscript ( )2 denotes a polynomial which is uniquely 
defined mod l. 
To begin the proof we start with gl' hi in Z[x] withj==glhl (mod q), 
and we find g2' h2 withj==g2h2 (mod q2). 
Letj==glhl + qk, (mod q2). Sincej, g" hi are all monic we can choose 
kl with deg kl < degj. 

B Factoring Modulo High Powers of Primes 
199 
We look for g2' h2 in the form g2 = g) + qG), h2 = h) + qH) for some 
G), H) in Z[x]. If we do, then the equation 
j = g2h2 (mod q2) 
becomes 
or 
or

Since g) and h) are assumed relatively prime mod q, equation (1) is 
solvable: in fact, if r) g) + s)h) = I (mod q), then H) = k)r), G) = k)s) 
solves (1). But we can also choose G), H) with deg G) < deg g), deg H) < 
deg h), by dividing k)r) by h) and k)s) by g) and letting H), G) be the 
respective remainders. We see this as follows. We have 
k)r) = h)') + H), k)s) = g)K) + G), . 
with deg H) < deg h), deg G) < deg g); substituting, we get 
or 
k) = k)r)g) + k)s)h) = h)') g) + H)g) + g)K)h) + h)G) (mod q) 
= h)g)(J) + K) + H)g) + h)G) (mod q), 
h)g)(J) + K) == k) -
H)g) -
h)G) (modq). 
The left side is a multiple of a monic polynomial of degree = deg j, 
namely, h) g), so if ') + K) ~ 0 (mod q), the left side has degree ~ degj. 
But the right side is a polynomial of degree <j, since deg k) < degj = 
deg g)h). So ') =K) (mod q) and the remainders H), G) solve (1). 
When we set g2 = gj + qG), h2 = h) + qHj, then since deg Gj < deg gl' 
etc., g2 and h2 are monic; clearly g2 =g) (mod q), h2 =h) (mod q), and 
j=g2h2 (mod q2). 
Now we show that g2 and h2 are relatively prime modulo q2. 
We have r) gl + slh) = 1 + qW (mod q2) for some polynomial W in 
Z[x]. We look for r2, S2 such that r2g2 + s2h2 = 1 (mod q2) by choosing 
r2, S2 of the form r2 =rl + qT) (mod q), S2 =SI + qUI (mod q) for some 
T), UI to be found. Then 
r2g2 + s2h2 = (r) + qT)(g) + qG) + (s) + qU)(h) + qHI) (mod q2) 
= r)gl + s)h) + q(g)TI + h) U) + rIG) + sIH) (mod q2) 
= I + q(W) + glT) + h)U) + rIG) + sIH) (mod q2). 
It suffices to choose T I , U) so that 
glTI + h)UI = -WI -
riG) -
slHI (modq). 

200 
I3 Factoring in iIJ![x), III: mod M 
But this can be done because gl and hi are relatively prime mod q. Since 
rl gl + slhl == 1 (mod q) 
we can choose 
TI = rl( - WI - rlGI - sIHI)' 
UI = sl( - WI - rlGI - sIHI)' 
If we do, then setting r2 = r l + qTI' S2 = SI + qUI' we get 
r2g2 + s2h2 == 1 (mod q2) 
and g2 and h2 are relatively prime modulo q2. This completes the existence 
part of the proof. 
For uniqueness, suppose g2 ==gl (mod q) and gJ ==gl (mod q); also 
h2 ==hl (mod q), hJ ==hl (mod q), each of g2' gJ, h2' hJ is monic, and 
f == g2h2 == gJhJ (mod q2). Then 
gJ = g2 + qm with deg m < deg g2' 
hJ = h2 + qn with deg n < deg h2. 
We show m, n == 0 (mod q). 
If, say, n ~ 0 (mod q), then, since g2h2 ==g4h4 (mod q2), we have 
g2n + h2m == 0 (mod q). 
(2) 
Since g2 and h2 are relatively prime modulo q, 
g2r2 + h2s2 == 1 (mod q). 
(3) 
Multiply (2) by r2 : 
r2g2n + r2h2m == 0 (mod q) 
Substitute for r2 g2, using (3): 
(1 - h2s2)n + r2h2m == 0 (mod q) 
or 
n == h2(S2n - r2m) (mod q). 
Since h2 is monic and n ~ 0, it must be that S2n - r2m ~ ° 
(mod q), and so 
deg n ~ deg h2' which is a contradiction. Thus n must == 0, and, by a 
similar argument, m == ° 
(mod q). Thus g2 == gJ (mod q2), h2 == hi 
(mod q2). The proof is complete. 
D 
Notice that once we know a factorization mod q by polynomials which 
are relatively prime mod q, the proof shows how to construct a factoriza-
tion mod q2 by polynomials which are relatively prime mod q2 and how to 
exhibit the relative primeness. Thus the proof describes how to proceed 
from a factorization mod q to a factorization mod q2, then mod l, then 
mod q8, etc. In practice, however, we may prefer to use linear algebra to 
find factorizations, having assurance from the theorem that the equations 
we set up will have unique solutions. We illustrate this latter approach in 
the course of developing the following 

B Factoring Modulo High Powers of Primes 
201 
EXAMPLE. Let J(x) = x5 + 2X4 - 8x3 + 2X2 + 3x + 7. We will detach the 
coefficients and write J = (1 2 - 8 2 3 7). 
Here 
Now mod 2, J == (1 0 0 0 1 1) = (1 1 1)(1 1 0 1), with both (1 1 1) and 
(l 1 0 1) irreducible (mod 2). So if J(x) factors in Z[x], it must have a 
factor of degree 2 whose coefficients are in absolute value < (4v'2)2 = 32. 
We can then take M > 64: any factorization mod M with M > 64 will 
yield a unique possible factorization in Z[x]. 
Starting fromJ= (1 000 1 1) = (1 1 1)(1 1 0 1) (mod 2), we let 
Thus 
g) = (III), 
h) = (1 101), 
J - g) h) = (12 -8237) - (I 222 1 1) 
= (00 -10 0 2 6) = 2( - 5013) 
== 2(101 1) (mod 4). 
k) == (1 0 1 1) (mod 2) 
We set g2 = gl + 2G), h2 = h) + 2H), and solve 
kl == glH) + hlGI (mod 2) 
or 
(101 1) == (1 1 I)H) + (1 10 l)GI 
with deg GI < 2, deg HI < 3. 
We can solve this by first solving r l(1 1 1) + sl(1 1 0 1) == 1 (mod 2) as 
in the proof. But we prefer to set HI = (a be), GI = (d e), and solve 
directly for the coefficients. If we do, we get from 
(101 1) == (1 1 1)(a b c) + (1 10 1)(d e) (mod 2) 
a system of linear equations mod 2: 
0= a + d; 
1 = a + b + d + e; 
0= a + b + c + e; 
1 = b + c + d; 
1 = c + e. 

202 
I3 Factoring in Q[xJ, III: mod M 
This is easy to solve: a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1, e = 1. So 
H) = (100), 
G) = (11), 
and 
g2 = g) + 2G) = (1 1 1) + 2(1 1) = (1 33), 
h2 = h) + 2H) = (1 101) + 2(1 00) = (1301). 
Then 
j == g2h2 (mod 4). 
Now we set q = 4 and change sqbscripts, so that 
j = (12 - 8237), 
g) = (133), 
h) = (1 30 1), 
and try to lift the factorization j ==g)h) (mod 4) to one that is mod 
16. Take 
k) = j - g)h) == (12 -8237) - (1 6 121033) 
= (0 -4 -20 -804) = 4(-1 -5 -201) 
Thus, mod 4, 
k) = (-1 -5 -201) = (33201). 
We set 
g2 = g) + 4G) = (I 33) + 4(d e), 
h2 = h) + 4H) = (1301) + 4(a be), 
where G), H) solve 
or 
or, mod 4, 
(33201) == (13 3)(a b c) + (130 1)(d e) 
3=a+d, 
3 = 3a + b + 3d + e, 
2 = 3a + 3b + c + 3e, 
0= 3b + 3c + d, 
1 = 3c + e, 
which we solve mod 4 to get 
a = 2, 
b = 3, 
c = 2, 
d = 1, 
e = 3. 
Thus 
g2 = (133) + 4(13) = (1 7 15) == (1 7 -1) (mod 16), 
h2 = (1301) + 4(232) = (I 11129) == (I -5 -4 9) (mod 16). 

B Factoring Modulo High Powers of Primes 
Now we try mod 162 = 256. Resubscripting, as before, we have 
f = (1 2 - 8 2 3 7), 
Thus 
Set 
gl = (l 7 -1), 
hi = (1 -5 -4 9), 
f- glhl = (l2 -8237) - (1 
2 -40 -14 67 -9) 
= (003216 -6416) = 16(2 1 -41). 
kl = (21 -41). 
g2 = gl + 16GI = (l 7 -1) + 16(d e), 
h2 = hi + 16HI = (1 -5 -49) + 16(abc), 
where GI = (d e), HI = (a b c). Solve 
kl == glHI + hi GI (mod 16) 
or 
(21 -41) == (1 7 -1)(a be) + (1 -5 -4 9)(d e) (mod 16) 
or, mod 16, 
0= a + d, 
2 = 7a + b - 5d + e, 
1 = -a+7b+ c-4d-5e, 
-4 = - b + 7c + 9d - 4e, 
1=-c+ge. 
After a little effort, we get 
a = -5, 
b = 3, 
c = 2, 
d = 5, 
e = -5. 
Thus 
g2 = (l 7 -I) + 16(5 -5) = (l 87 -81), 
h2 = (1 -5 -4 9) + 16( -5 32) = (I -85 44 41), 
and 
f -
g2h2 = 256(0 0 -29 42 0 -13). 
203 
Now any possible factor of f of degree 2 must be congruent mod 2 to 
(1 1 1), hence (by the uniqueness of the theorem) must be congruent 
mod 256 to (1 87 - 81). Since (l 87 - 81) has coefficients which are larger 
in absolute value than 32, and any other polynomial congruent mod 256 to 
(l 87 - 81) is worse, f therefore can have no factor of degree 2. Since a 
factor of f of degree 1 would yield a factor of degree 1 of f mod 2, and f 
has no factor of degree I mod 2, it follows that f must be irreducible in 
Z[x].

13 Factoring in Q[x], III: mod M 
The process of getting from a factorization mod p to one that is mod p2N 
is one which is quite mechanical, and would not be difficult to program on 
a computer. The only unpleasant feature of the whole factorization process 
is that it is rather inefficient if applied to a polynomialf(x) which turns out 
to be irreducible in Z[ x] but which factors into many factors mod p for all 
p. Such anf(x) has many factorizations modp, each of which would have 
to be lifted to mod p2N > M and then discarded. In Chapter 111-6 we give a 
class of such bad examples. 
I do not know how scarce such examples are. 
An interesting article on recent progress in factoring polynomials is 
Collins (1973).

III. FIELDS 
This part of the book begins with the primitive element theorem and 
applications of it, material which continues the development of Part I and 
could be taken up before Part II. Then the notion of congruence classes 
modulo a polynomial leads to the invention of many new fields; with the 
aid of the primitive element theorem we completely classify fields with 
finitely many elements. After a look at quadratic residues (again a con-
tinuation of Part I), the book concludes with a look at algebraic number 
fields and examples of both rings which do and rings which do not have 
unique factorization as 7L and F[ x] do. 

Primitive Elements 1 
This last part of the book is mostly about fields. So far, we know that Q, 
~, and C, with which the book began, are fields, as is 7Lp whenever p is 
prime, and we also have GF(9), a field with 9 elements we discovered in 
Chapter 1-11. 
Using the notion of congruence classes in polynomial rings we shall, 
starting in 111-7, invent many new examples of fields in the same way we 
invented the fields 7Lp" We shall begin this part, however, with the primitive 
element theorem, a very useful theorem about the structure of fields with a 
finite number of elements. This theorem is valid both for the examples we 
shall construct later and for the fields 7Lp we already know about. The five 
following chapters will be devoted to immediate applications of this 
theorem. 
Recall from Chapter 1-11, Section E, that the order of a nonzero 
element a of a finite field F is the smallest positive integer e for which 
a e = 1. 
Primitive Element Theorem. Let F be a field with q elements. There is some 
element a in F such that 
(1) every non-zero element of F is a power of a, and 
(2) the order of a is q - 1. 
An element a satisfying conditions (1) and (2) is called a primitive 
element of F. 
The primitive element theorem is a refinement of Fermat's theorem. 
Fermat's theorem says that if F is a field with q elements and /3 =1= 0 in F, 
then /3q-1 = 1. The primitive element theorem says that there is some 
element a of F with a q - I = 1 and satisfying the extra condition that no 

208 
1 Primitive Elements 
smaller positive power of a is equal to 1. Fermat's theorem follows easily 
from the primitive element theorem. For if a is a primitive element, then 
any f3::f=O is a power of a, say 13= a r• Since a q- I = 1, f3 q- 1 = (ar)q-I = 
(aq-1y = 1. 
An example of a primitive element is a = [2]11 in Ill. In fact, (1) holds: 
[1] = alO, [2] = a, [3] = a 8, [4] = a2, [5] = a4, [6] = a9, [7] = a1, [8] = a 3, 
[9] = a6, [10] = a 5• 
We also showed the existence of a primitive element for GF(9) in 
Chapter 1-11. 
El. Find a primitive element of 1:2; of 1:3; of 1:5; of 1:7; of 1:13; of 1:\7; of 1:19; of 
1:23 (cf. I-II, E24 and E26). 
Here is a proof of the primitive element theorem. 
PROOF. Let a be any nonzero element of F. 
We just observed that by Fermat's theorem the order of a is at most 
q - 1, the number of invertible elements of F; in fact, by Proposition 1, 
Section 1-11 E, the order of a divides q - 1. 
The idea of the proof is to study the set S of orders of elements of F. 
Since every a in F has order dividing q - 1, S is a set of integers" q - 1, 
and the proof will be essentially complete when we show q - 1 is in S. For 
if q - 1 is in S then q - 1 is the order of some a in F, so a q - I = 1 and no 
smaller positive power of a is equal to 1. That is, part (2) of the theorem is 
true. 
Once we know that an a satisfying part (2) of the theorem exists, then 
part (I) follows. For if a has order q - 1, then 1, a, a2, ••• , a q- 2 are all 
different, by Exercise E2, and so they are all of the q - 1 nonzero elements 
of F. 
E2. Show that if e > I is the order of an element a in a field F, then 
I, a, a 2, ••• , a e - I are distinct. 
To prove the theorem, then, we need to know about orders of elements 
of F. 
Recall the fact we proved in Chapter 1-11 on Fermat's theorem that if e 
is the order of a, and if a1 = 1 for some f > 0, then e divides f. 
E3. Prove this without looking it up. 
Claim 1. If a, b are in S (that is, a and b are orders of elements of F) and a 
and b are relatively prime, then ab is in S. 
PROOF. Suppose a has order a, and 13 has order b. Then (af3)ab = 1. 
Suppose c is some positive integer such that (af3Y = 1. Then 1 = (af3r = 
a caf3ca = f3 ca, so b divides ac. Since b and a are relatively prime, b divides 

I Primitive Elements 
209 
c. Similarly, from i = (af3yb = a cb, we get that a divides c. So [a, b] = ab 
divides c. Thus ab is the order of af3, and ab is in S. 
Claim 2. If f3 has order band d is alD' positive divisor of b, then f3b/d has 
order d; thus d is in S. 
E4. Prove Claim 2. 
aaim 3. If a, b are in S then [a, b] is in S. 
PROOF. Let a = pi' ... p/', b = p{' ... PI'. By claim 2, if a is in S so is 
any factor of a. Thus pi', ... ,p/', ph •.. ,pI' are all in S. So pjax(e,,J,), 
piax(e2.f2), ... , are all in S. By claim I, 
p,{,-ax(e,,J,) . prax(e2.h) •.• pr:w'(e"fr) 
is in S, but this is the least common mUltiple of a and b. 
Let eo be the largest number in S. 
Claim 4. Every number in S divides eo. 
For if a is in S and eo is in S, then the least common multiple of a and 
eo is in S. But if eo is the largest number in S, then that least common 
multiple, which is always ;;;. eo, must be equal to eo. Thus a divides eo. 
aaim 5. eo = q - 1. 
For since every number in S divides eo, every nonzero element a of F 
satisfies a eo = 1. There are q - I nonzero elements of F, so there are q - I 
different roots in F of the polynomial x eo -
1. By Corollary 2, Section 
II-2A, x eo -
I cannot have more than eo roots in the field F, so we must 
have eo ;;;. q - 1. Since every number in S is ~ q - I, therefore eo = q - 1. 
This means that q - I is in S, and therefore there is some element a in F 
whose order is q - 1. 
That proves (2). Since we have already proved (1) from (2), the proof of 
the primitive element theorem is complete. 
D 
The proof we have just given for the existence of a primitive element 
gives no simple formula for taking a prime p and finding a primitive 
element of 7Lp• In fact, no one knows of such a formula. About the nicest 
result known is that if p is a prime of the form 4q + 1 where q is prime, 
then 2 is a priniitive element of 7Lp' Thus 2 is a primitive element of 7Lp for 
p = 5, 13, 29, 53 (among primes < 100). For reasons related to repeating 
decimals (see below, Chapter 2), it is particularly interesting to know 
whether 10 is Ii primitive element of 7Lp• It turns out to be so for p = 7, 17, 
19, 23, 29, 47, 59, 61, and 97 among primes < 100, but it is an unsolved 

210 
I Primitive Elements 
conjecture of Gauss (1801) that there exist infinitely many primesp with 10 
a primitive element of 7L.p" A generalization of Gauss's conjecture dating 
from the 1920s by the mathematician E. Artin asserts that if a is any 
integer not a square, then a is a primitive element of 7L.p for infinitely many 
primes p. Artin's conjecture has been shown to be true provided that a 
conjecture called the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true (Hooley 
(1967)). But the latter, dating from the 19th century and having to do with 
the values of the complex number s at which a certain function ns), which 
for s real and > 1 satisfies 
~l 
r(s) = £.J nS' 
n=1 
has the value zero, is perhaps the most outstanding unsolved problem in all 
of mathematics. 
Gauss, in his Disquisitiones Arithemeticae (1801), discusses the problem 
of assigning to a prime p a primitive element of 7L.p and quotes Euler as 
saying that the nature of primitive elements is one of the deepest mysteries 
of numbers. 
For a survey of this mystery, see Goldstein (1973). 
Of course, for any given prime p, since 7L.p is finite there are only a finite 
number of possibilities for a primitive element, and trial and error will 
always eventually work (see E8).

E8. Show that there are q,(q - 1) primitive elements in a field with q elements 
(Use Exercise E7). Verify this for the fields l13' ll7. 
E9. Letp be an odd prime, and b an integer so that [b) is a primitive element of 
lp- Show: If (a,p) = 1, then x 2 =a (modp) has a solution iff a =b' (modp) 
with r even. 
There is some group theoretic terminology which relates to the primitive 
element theorem. 
Definition. A finite group G is cyclic if there is some LX in G such that every 
element of G is obtainable as a product of copies of LX. Such an element LX 
is called a generator of G. 
What the primitive element theorem shows is that the group U of 
invertible elements of a field F of q elements is a cyclic group. A primitive 
element of F is the same as a generator of U.

Repeating Decimals, II 
In this chapter we examine the orders of elements of 71.., for any number I, 
and complete our study of repeating decimals. These subjects are closely 
related, for we showed in Chapter 1-12 that the base a expansion of ull, 
(I, a) = 1, (t, u) = 1, 0 < u < I, is repeating: 
~ = (.a 1a2 ... ada 1a2 ... ada l ••• )a = (. a 1a2 ... ad t, 
where d, the length of the period of repetition or, as we shall say for short, 
the period, is the smallest number n such that an == 1 (mod I). That is, the 
period of ullin base a is the order of a mod I. 
The primitive element theorem gives the maximal possible period for 
u II when 1 is prime. 
Theorem 1. If 1 is prime, Ihen Ihere are infinitely many bases d for which 111 
has a base a expansion wilh period cp( I) = 1 - 1. 
PROOF. For if [a] is a primitive element of 71.." then the smallest number n 
for which an == 1 (mod I) is n = 1 - 1. 
D 
As an example, let 1 = 7. Then [3] and [5] are primitive elements. So the 
expansions of 117 in base a have period 6 whenever a == 3 or 5 (mod 7), 
that is, a = 3, 5, 10, 12, 17, 19,24,26, .... In fact:

Here is a nice application of the fact that if a is a primitive element 
mod t, then every number b, 1 .e;;; b < t, is congruent mod t to a power of a. 
Corollary. Suppose t is prime and a is a primitive element mod t. Suppose 
1 t = (.rOrlr2 ... r/_ I L· 
If b is a natural number < t such that b =-ak (mod t), where o.e;;; k < t, then 
b t = (.rkrk+ I ... r/_Irorl ... rk- I )a' 
PROOF. If 
then 
Nowak = b + mt for some integer m, so a k / t = m + (b / t). Equating 
fractional parts of a k / t gives the result.

In order to determine periods of expansions of u / t with t not prime, we 
have to get an analogue of the primitive element theorem for 71./. That is, 
we have to find the maximal order of an invertible element of 71./, Once we 
do that, we will have determined all orders, by Exercises El and E19. 
El. If a has order e mod t andIle then a e/J has order I mod t. 
E2. What is the period of 1/7 in base 3? 9? 27? 
Let h(t) be the maximal order of an invertible element of 71./. We know 
that h(t) divides cp(t), the number of natural numbers < t which are 
relatively prime to t, by Chapter 1-11. Our aim in the rest of this chapter is 
to find h( t). 
The strategy for finding h(t) is to determine h(t) for t = pe, the power of 
an odd prime p, then h(2e), and finally h(t) for any t. We shall do this via a 
series of exercises. 

214 
2 Repeating Decimals, II 
Proposition 2. If p is an odd prime and e ~ 1, then h(pe) = q,(pe) = pe(p_ 
1). 
We shall illustrate the proof of this by proving a special case. 
Proposition 3. For each e ~ 1, 10 has order q,(7e) mod 7e. Thus 1/7e has a 
repeating decimal expansion in base 10 whose period has length </>(7e) = 
7e - I ·6. 
It follows from Proposition 3 that {l/7e }e;;'1 forms a sequence of 
fractions whose periods in base 10 go to 00 with e. In particular, this gives 
one way (not the best) to solve Exercise E9 of Chapter 1-12. 
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 3. We first notice that 10 has order 6 (mod 7), and 
that u1 == (98 + 2)3 == 8 (mod 72), so that 106 ~ I (mod 72). We show that 
the order of 10 (mod 49) is </>(49) = 7·6. 
Suppose b is the order of 10 (mod 49). Since 107-6 = 1 (mod 49), b 
divides 7·6. Write b = a or b = 7a where a divides 6. Now if 10'> = 
1 
(mod 49), then 10'> == 1 (mod 7). If b = a then 10" == 1 (mod 7); since a 
divides 6, the order of 10 (mod 7), therefore a must equal 6. If b = 7 a then 
1070 == 1 (mod 7), so 10" == 1 (mod 7) by Fermat's theorem, so again a = 
6. Therefore the order b of 10 mod 49 must be b = 6 or b = 7·6. Since 
1<f ~ 1 (mod 49), therefore b = 7 . 6. 
Now we show that for any e ~ 2, the order d of 10 mod 7e is 7e - ' • 6. 
Since d divides q,(7e) = 7e- 1 • 6, therefore d = 7' . c with c dividing 6. If 
l(f = 107'·c == 1 (mod 7e) then 107'·c == 1 (mod 72), so 7'· c must be divisi-
ble by 7·6. Therefore r ~ 1 and c = 6. We need to find the smallest 
possible r. 
Since 1()6 ~ 1 (mod 49) we can write 106 = 1 + 7a with (a, 7) = 1. Then 
for any r > 1, using the binomial theorem, 
(106( = (1 + 7af' = 1 + 7,+la + (mUltiples of7,+2) 
== 1 + 7'+ la (mod 7,+2) 
for any r ~ O. In particular, 
(106)r> == 1 + 7e- 1a (mod 7e). 
Since (a, 7) = 1, it follows that 
(1()6(-2 ~ 1 (mod 7e). 
Thus the smallest number d such that 10'" == 1 (mod 7e) is 6· 7e - ' = q,(7e), 
proving the theorem.

period dividing l.c.m.(m, n). Can the period divide l.c.m.(m, n) properly? Can 
it equall.c.m.(m, n)? 
The question of the orders of elements mod p2 for p prime relates to a 
very famous problem in number theory, known as Fermat's last theorem. 
Fermat claimed (in 1636): 
If n > 2, then there are no integers x,y, z satisfying 
xn + yn = zn 
Fermat provided no proof. No proof has been found since. 
(I) 
If n ~ 3, one can write n = ab with a = 4 or an odd prime. If x, y, z 
satisfy xn + yn = zn, then (xbt + (yb)Q = (zb)Q. So in order to show that 

2 Repeating Decimals, II 
217 
(I) has no solutions for any n > 2, it suffices to show (I) has no solutions 
for n = 4 or an odd prime. Fermat did prove the case n = 4. 
For odd primes p the problem has been attacked by first trying to show, 
as a first case, that if xP + yP = zP with xyz:;6 0, x,y, z relatively prime, 
then p divides xyz (so that any solution in the integers reduces to a trivial 
solution modp). 
In 1909 Wieferich proved: If 2p-1 ~ I (modp2), then the first case of 
Fermat's last theorem holds. 
By 1914 it had been shown that if the first case of Fermat's last theorem 
is false (that is, there exist integers x,y, z withp not dividing xyz such that 
xP + yP = zP), then not only is 2p-1 = 
1 (modp2) but also qP-1 == 1 
(modp2) for q = 2,3,5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,23,29, and 31. 
Primes satisfying such conditions are scarce. The only two primes 
p < 3,000,000,000 for which 2P - 1 == 1 (modp2) arep = 1093 andp = 3511. 
Since y-I ~ 1 (modp2) for those two primes, the first case of Fermat's 
last theorem is true for all primes less than 3,000,000,000. 
The largest known prime (as of 1976) is 219937 - 1. Using Wieferich's 
result it can be shown that the first case of Fermat's last theorem holds for 
that prime. 
Incidentally, it is now known that if there exist x, y, z with 0 < x <y < z 
and xP + yP = zP, then x must have at least a million digits. 
The corresponding problem in ~[x] is much easier. It was given as 
Exercise E6, Chapter 11-6. 
E17. What about x P + yP = zP whenp =27 
E18. What is the order of 2 mod p2 for p = 5, 7, 11, 13? 
E19. Show that the order of any invertible element of It divides h(t). (Hint: Show 
that Claims 1-4 of pages 208-9 hold for the set S of orders of invertible 
elements of It.)

Testing for Primeness 
In this chapter we consider how to find large primes for use in the secret 
codes described in Chapter 1-15. 
The primitive element theorem says: If p is prime, then there is some 
natural number a <p whose order modp is p - 1, that is, aP - 1 == 1 
(modp) and no smaller positive power of a is congruent modp to 1. The 
converse is 
Proposition. Suppose q is a natural number > 2. If there is some a < q such 
that the order of a mod q is exactly q - 1, then q is a prime number. 
PROOF. If q is not prime, then cp(q), the number of natural numbers less 
than q which are relatively prime to q, is less than q - 1; if a <q, then 
either a is not relatively prime to q, hence no power of a is congruent to 1 
mod q, or a is relatively prime to q, in which case, by Euler's theorem, its 
order mod q must divide cp(q) < q - 1. 
D 
Thus: q is prime iff there is an element of order exactly q - 1 mod q. 
How, then, do we decide whether a given number q is prime? We have a 
negative test, from Fermat's theorem: 
(-) If a q - l ~ 1 (mod q) for some a < q, then q is not prime. 
We have a positive test, from the proposition: 
(+) If for some a the order of a (mod q) is q - 1, then q is prime. 
Unfortunately, test (+) is very impractical. For while it is very easy, 
using the strategy of Section I-lID, to decide whether a q - l == 1 (mod q) 

3 Testing for Primeness 
219 
for any a and q, it is much harder to prove that the order of a is q - 1 
(mod q). It has to be shown that for any prime p dividing q - 1, a(q-I)/p ~ 
1 (mod q). And to do that, one must be able to factor q - 1, a problem of 
almost the same size as that of factoring q. 
Here is a small example. Let q = 11213. After checking that 11213 is not 
divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, II, and a few other small primes, we suspect that 
11213 might be prime. We compute 211212 (mod 11213) and verify that it is 
== 1 (mod 11213). To apply test (+) we must find the order of 2 
mod 11213. So we have to factor 11212. Now 11212 = 22. 2803. Is 2803 
prime? This problem is not much less difficult than the original problem. It 
turns out that 2803 is prime, and that neither 211212/2 nor 211212/2803 is 
congruent to 1 mod 11213; hence 2 is a primitive element mod 11213 and 
11213 is prime. 
If we took, instead of 11213, some 40-digit number q, then to use (+) 
we would have to factor q - 1, and chances are good that after factoring 
out all the obvious small prime factors one would be left with a factor of 
q - I containing 35 or more digits and which we would have to factor-al-
most as hard a problem as factoring q itself. 
So test ( + ) is not very helpful. 
We might ask: Suppose we know only that q is a number for which 
2q - 1 == 1 (mod q); how likely is it that q is prime? 
The answer appears to be: excellent. 
Call a number q fermatian if 2q - I == 1 (mod q). 
Call a number q a pseudo prime if for all integers a, a q ==a (mod q). 
Any prime is a pseudoprime. Any odd pseudoprime is fermatian: for if 
2q == 2 (mod q) and q is odd, we can cancel a factor of 2 from each side. 
It turns out that there are infinitely many fermatian numbers which are 
not primes. 
Proposition. Iff is a composite fermatian number, then so is 21 - 1. 
PROOF. Suppose f= ab, a> I, b > 1. Let g = 21 - 1. Then g is composite, 
for 
(*) 
Suppose 21- 1 == 1 (modi). We show 2g - 1 == 1 (mod g), that is, 21 - 1 
divides 2g - 1 - 1. By (*) it suffices to show that f divides g - 1. Now since 
21- 1 == I (modi), f divides 2/-1 - 1. Since g - 1 = 21 - 1- 1 = 2(21- 1-
1),1 divides g - 1. So g is a composite fermatian number. 
0 
Despite this result, fermatians which are not prime are scarce, and 
pseudoprimes are even scarcer. There are 168 primes < 1000, but only 
three composite fermatians-341, 561 (the only composite pseudoprime) 
and 645; there are, according to D. H. Lehmer and P. Poulet, 5,761,455 
primes under 100,000,000, but only 2043 composite fermatians and 252 
composite pseudoprimes. 

220 
3 Testing for Primeness 
Thus if one picks a 4O-digit number q and verifies that 2q - 1 = 1 
(mod q), 3q - 1 == 1 (mod q), etc., the likelihood is high that q is prime. 
(However, I do not know of a result which describes the ratio of composite 
pseudoprimes ..; n (or composite fermatians ..; n) to all pseudoprimes ..; n 
(or all fermatians ..; n) for large numbers n.) 
In Chapter 1-15 we were interested in finding large prime numbers for 
use in designing secret codes. It turns out that for such codes it is sufficient 
to use pseudoprimes, and it does not matter whether or not the pseudo-
primes are actually prime. 
Suppose p and q happen to be pseudoprimes. If we let N = qp and set 
up a code as in Chapter 1-15, it would work provided q andp are relatively 
prime (which is easy to check by Euclid's algorithm). For then CP(N) = 
CP(p)CP(q), and since q is a pseudoprime, q - 1 is divisible by cp(q) (by 
E7(a», and similarly for p. For any s relatively prime to (p - 1)(q - 1), we 
can find I with sl - k(p - 1)(q - 1) = 1 for some k; then for any integer a, 
a st = al+k(p-I)(q-I). 
Now if p and q are relatively prime pseudoprimes, N is squarefree, by 
E7(b), so by E7(c) 
ak(P-I)(q-I)+ 1 == a (mod pq); 
thus 
a st == a (mod N). 
Thus even if p and q happened to be composite pseudoprimes, the code 
would work for any code word a with 0 < a < N. 
tEl. A Fermat number is a number of the form 22" + 1. Fermat conjectured that 
for any n, 22" + 1 was prime. It was one of his worst conjectures, for no such 
number has been proved prime for n > 4, and some 21 of them have been 
proved composite. You prove that a Fermat number is fermatian. 
E2. A Mersenne number is a number of the form 2P - 1 where p is prime. It is 
known that 2P - 1 is prime for some 24 primes p, and 219937 - 1 is the largest 
known prime of any form. You prove that a Mersenne number is fermatian.

(a) 22427; 
(b) 32767;

(d) 274177. 
E4. To apply test ( +) it is necessary not only to know the primes dividing q - 1, 
but also to be lucky enough to pick a primitive element mod q. If q is prime 
and some number a, 1 ..; a ..; q - 1, is chosen at random, the likelihood that a 
is a frimitive element is </>(q - 1)/ q - 1. How big can this ratio be? What is it 
for 1213? For 2803? *How small can it be? 
ES. Show that 2803 is prime by showing that 2 is a primitive element mod 2803. 

3 Testing for Primeness 
E6. Test 3q- 1 == 1 (mod q) for q = 341 and 645. 
E7. Prove the following. 
(a) If q is pseudoprime, then q,(q) divides q - 1. 
(b) If q is pseudoprime, then q is squarefree (use (a». 
221 
(c) Conclude from (a), (b), and Exercise E14 of 1-14 that if N = pq, p, q 
pseudoprimes with (p, q) = 1, then for any integer a, 
ak(P-l)(q-l)+1 == 1 (mod N). 
There are a number of papers in the journal, Mathematics of Computa-
tion, Volumes 29 (1975) and 30 (1976), on techniques for factoring large 
numbers. One of the best is a method in Morrison and Brillhart (1975), 
which uses continued fractions. Their technique was applied to factor 
Fermat numbers. Expositions of continued fractions (which in essence are 
an application of Euclid's algorithm) may be found in many books on 
number theory, such as Stark (1971), or Chrystal (1898-1900, Chapter 
XXXII). 
The facts about pseudoprimes in this chapter came from Shanks (1962).

Fourth Roots of One in Ip 
A. Primes 
In Chapter 1-4 on primes, we proved that there were infinitely many 
primes of the form 4k + 3. We observed that according to a theorem of 
Dirichlet, for any a, r with (a, r) = I there are infinitely many primes of 
the form ak + r (where k varies). In particular (with a = 4, r = 1) there are 
infinitely many primes of the form 4k + 1. Using the existence of primitive 
elements we can prove this fact without appealing to Dirichlet's theorem. 
Here is the main step in the proof. 
Theorem.Ifp is an odd prime, then -I is a square modp iffp == 1 (mod 4). 
PROOF. If P == I (mod 4) thenp - 1= 4r for some r. Let [a] be a primitive 
element of IF" The order of [a] in lp is 4r, so (aTf ~ I (modp) but is a 
root of x 2 - 1==0 (mod p). Now x 2 - 1 in lAx] has only two roots, [1] 
and [-I], since lp is a field, so (aTf == -1 (modp). Thus -I is a square 
modp. 
Conversely, suppose p is odd and b2 == - I (mod p). If [a] is a primitive 
element of lp, then b ==as (modp) for some s, so (a s)2 = - I (modp). 
Since p -I is the order of a and (a(p-l)/2f== 1 (modp), as in the last 
paragraph, a(p-l)/2 == - I (mod p). By Exercise E6 of Chapter 1, 
p-I 
-2- == 2s (mod(p - 1», 
so 
p - I = 4s + 2(p - I) t 
for some integer t. Since p - 1 is even, p == 1 (mod 4). That completes the 
proof.

B Finite fields of complex numbers 
223 
Using the theorem, we get easily 
Corollary 1. There are infinitely many primes of the form 4k + 1. 
PROOF. Assume that PI' ... 'Pn are all of the primes congruent to I mod 4. 
Consider s = 4(PI ... Pni + 1. Let q be a prime which divides s. Then 
clearly q cannot be 2 or any of PI' ... ,Pn. 
Now s == 0 (mod q), so 4(PI ... Pn)2 == - I (mod q). Therefore -I is a 
square mod q, and so q == I (mod 4). Therefore PI' ... ,Pn are not all of the 
primes congt;Uent to I mod 4. This contradicts our assumption and proves 
the corollary. 
0 
B. Finite Fields of Complex Numbers 
A second consequence of the theorem is that if P == 3 (mod 4) then x 2 + I 
is irreducible in Zp[x]. That being so, we can invent "complex numbers 
modp" just as we invented GF(9) in Chapter I-llF. Here is how. 
Let i be an invented root of x 2 + I. Consider the set of "numbers" of 
the form a + bi, where a, b are in Zp' Call the set of such numbers Zp[i]. 
Add them and multiply them as if they were polynomials in i, or complex 
numbers: 
(a + bi) + (e + di) = (a + e) + (b + d)i; 
(a + bi)(e + di) = ae + bdi2 + (ad + be)i = ae - bd + (ad + be)i. 
(Since i is a root of x 2 + I, ;2 + I = 0, so ;2 = - 1.) It is easy to verify that 
with these operations, ZAi] is a commutative ring. 
In fact, Zp[i] is a field if P == 3 (mod 4). For then, by the theorem, x 2 + I 
is irreducible in Zp[ x]. So if a + bx is any nonzero polynomial in Zp[ x], 
Bezout's lemma gives 
I = (a + bx)J(x) + (x2 + I)g(x) 
for somef(x), g(x) in Zp[x]. Setting x = i gives I = (a + bi)f(i). That shows 
that any nonzero element of Zp[ i] is invertible, and therefore Zp[ i] is a 
field. 
It is easy to see that ZAi] has p2 elements, for if a + bi is a typical

Telephone Cable Splicing 5 
In the 1920s and '30s and perhaps, in some places, yet today, telephone 
lines were formed out of WOO-foot lengths of wire cables spliced together. 
These cables, in simplified form, have a crosssection which looks like this: 
000 
o 
0 
000 
Each little circle is the crosssection of a wire carrying a single conversation. 
One problem which arose is that if two conversations are carried on 
adjacent wires for long distances there is a lot of cross-talk-both con-
versations are heard on both wires. One way to alleviate this is by splicing 
lengths of cables together so that two conversations which are adjacent on 
one length of cable will not be adjacent on the next sevj::ral lengths of 
cables. The problem then became how to do this in a simpk but effective 
way. 
This problem was considered by H. P. Lawther, of the Southwestern 
Bell Telephone Company, who, in solving it, used some number theory. 
What follows is based on part of his article (Lawther, 1935). 
It was decided to adopt the following strategy. 
(1) The same splicing instructions are to be used for every splice. 
(2) At each splice, if the n individual wires are labeled by 1,2, ... , n, then 
wire i in the left cable will be spliced to wire 1 + (i - I)s (mod n) in 

226 
5 Telephone Cable Splicing 
the right cable, where s is some fixed integer, 1 <; s < n, called the 
spacing number. 
El. Show that this is a viable strategy for any n and any s. That is, show that every 
wire on the right cable will get attached to some wire on the left cable. Show 
that two wires on the left cable never get spliced to the same wire on the right 
cable with this strategy. 
Splicing by the formula, n = 5, s = 2 
I = 1 + (1-1)2 
5 -
1 + (3 -1)2 
2 = 1 + (4-1)2 
4 == 1 + (5 -1)2 
3 ... 1 + (2 -1)2 
Given Exercise El, the problem becomes: For cables with n wires, which is 
the best spacing number s to use? To see which s to use, we shall first 
iterate the formula. 
If a given conversation is on wire i'_1 in the (r - l)st length of cable, it 
will be on wire i, = 1 + (i,-I - l)s on the rth length of cable. So the 
conversation on wire io at the Oth cable will be on wire i, on the rth cable, 
where 
i l = 1 + (io - l)s, 
i2 = 1 + (il - l)s = 1 + ([ 1 + (io - l)s] - l)s, 
= 1 + (io-l)s2, 
and in general, as you can (try to) prove by induction, 
i, = 1 + {io - l)s'. 
E2. Prove this. 
Now we want two conversations adjacent on the Oth length to not be 
adjacent for as many lengths as possible after the Oth length. Suppose 
the conversations on wires io and io + 1 are adjacent again on the rth 
length of cable. Then the location of conversation io on the rth length is 
1 + (io - l)s', the location of conversation io + 1 is 1 + «io + 1) - l)s', and 
these are adjacent, so 
1 + (io - l)s' = 1 + ((io + 1) - l)s' ± 1 (mod n). 

5 Telephone Cable Splicing 
227 
Simplifying, this becomes 
s' == ±1 (modn). 
Thus if we want any two conversations adjacent on the Oth length of cable 
to be nonadjacent for as long as possible, we should pick s so that the least 
r> 0 with s' == ± 1 (mod n) is as large as possible. 
EXAMPLE. Suppose n is an odd prime p. Then we know that p - I is even, 
and every integer s, I <s <p - I, satisfies 
SP-I == 1 (modp). 
Thus S(p-I)/2 is a root of x 2 -
I in lp[x]. But x 2 -
I has only the roots 
x == I, x == - 1 (modp) (since lp is a field); therefore 
S(P-I)/2 = 1 or -1 (modp). 
Thus for any s, the best possible r is r = (p - 1)/2. That is, regardless of 
the choice of spacing number s, if two conversations are adjacent in the 
Oth wire, they will necessarily be adjacent in the ((p - 1)/2)th wire. 
If we choose the spacing number s to be an integer so that [s]p is a 
primitive element of lp, then the best possible r is achieved. For if r is 
the smallest integer such that s' == ± I (modp), then S2, == 1 (modp). If 
[s]p is a primitive element, p - 1 divides 2r, so (p - 1)/2 divides r. Thus 
r=(p-I)/2. 
EXAMPLE. Suppose we have cables with 11 wires. Then [2]11 is a primitive 
element, so we can use s = 2. Then two conversations which are adjacent 
in a given length of cable will again be adjacent only in the fifth subse-
quent cable length ((11- 1)/2 = 5). 
Here is a table which describes the splicing in cables with 11 wires when 
s=2.

FA. Do the same for n = 12. (Some of the theory we applied will not work so well 
for n = 12 since 1:12 is not a field.) 

228 
5 Telephone Cable Splicing 
ES. Lawther shows how to do n = 12 in a nice way using the splicing instructions 
for n = 11 and cheating, namely, taking the table for n = 11 and altering it by 
splicing wire #7 to itself always, and replacing all the numbers r > 7 in the 
table by r + 1. Thus the first splice becomes

Is this a better strategy than that of Exercise E4? 
Describe an analogous "cheat" which works for n = 14; for n = p + l,p any 
prime. 
If one adopts the splicing strategy for n not prime, without cheating, the 
problem of finding the largest r such that calls adjacent on the Oth cable 
will not again be adjacent until the rth cable turns out to have the 
following solution. 
Let hen) be the maximum order of an invertible element of 7Ln . In 
Theorem 6 of Chapter 2, hen) was given as follows: If n factors as 
n = 2'Pf'PZ2 ... P:', then 
hen) = l.c.m.[2scf>(pf'), cf>(pz2), ••• ,cf>(P:')] 
with s = {e - 1, e = 1, 2.

If cf>(n) is the number of invertible congruence classes in 7Ln, then (see 111-2, 
E13) hen) = cf>(n) iff 7Ln has a primitive element iff n = 2, 4,p e, or 2p e for p 
an odd prime. 
Suppose the cables have n wires. If s is c40sen to be the best possible

It turns out that the problem of cross-talk can be eliminated technologi-
cally by using optical fibres to carry telephone signals rather than metal 
conductors. For an exposition of this rather new (in 1977) advance in 
telephone communications, see Boyle (1977). 

Factoring in Q[x], IV: 6 
Bad Examples mod p 
In Chapter 11-13, it was claimed that there were polynomials in Z[x] which 
were irreducible in Q[x] but factored modp for any prime p. Using the 
existence of a primitive element in Zp we can describe a class of such 
examples. 
Proposition. For any integers a, b and any prime p, f(x) = X4 + ax2 + b2 
factors mod p. 
PROOF. First suppose p = 2. Then any integer is congruent mod 2 to 0 or 1, 
so for any integers a, b, f(x) is congruent mod 2 to one of the following 
polynomials: 
X4; 
x4 + x2 = X2(X2 + I); 
X4 + I = (x + 1)4; 
X4 + x2 + I = (x2 + X + 1)2. 
Each of these is reducible mod 2. 
Now suppose p is an odd prime. Choose s so that a == 2s (mod p). Then 
f(x) =x4 + 2sx2 + b2 (modp), which can be written in each of the follow-
ing three ways: 
f(x) =(x2 + sf - (S2 - b2) 
(x2 + bf - (2b - 2S)X2 
. (x2 - bf'- (-2b - 2S)X2. 
To show that f(x) factors modp, it suffices to show that one of S2 - b2, 
2b - 2s, -2b - 2s is a square modp, for thenf(x) will be the difference of 
two squares modp. 

230 
6 Factoring in I/J!(x], IV: Bad Examples modp 
Let c be a primitive element mod p. If 2b - 2s and - 2b - 2s are not 
squares modp, then 2b-2s=.c r , -2b-2s=.c t (modp), where r and t 
are both odd. Then (2b - 2s)( - 2b - 2s) = 4(b2 - S2) =c r + t , where r + t 
= 2u is even. So 4(s2 - b2) is a square modp. Let 2m =. I (modp). Then 
S2 - b2 =. 4(s2 - b2)m2 =.c2um2 = (cUmi. SO S2 - b2 is a square modp. 
That completes the proof.

It is easy to find a, b such thatf(x) is irreducible in O[x]. For example, 
let a = 2, b = 2, so that f(x) = X4 + 2X2 + 4. Then f(x) has no roots. Also 
f(x) has no factors of degree 2: if you writef(x) = (x2 + cx + d)(x2 + ex + 
1), the equations for the coefficients are 
df= 4, 
cf+ de = 0, 
ce + d + f = 2, 
c + e = 0, 
with c, d, e, f integers. It is quickly checked that there are no integer 
solutions. So f(x) is irreducible. The exercises offer other examples. 
El. Show that x4 - x2 + I is irreducible in Q[x] but factors modp for all primes 
p. 
E2. Show that X4 + I is irreducible in Q[ x] but factors mod p for all primes p. 
*E3. Show that if a, b are integers with 0 < b < a, then X4 + 2ax2 + b2 is irreduc-
ible in Q[ x]. 
E4. Can Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion (11-8) be applied to any of the 
examples of the proposition? 

Congruence Classes 7 
Modulo a Polynomial: 
Simple Field Extensions 
In Chapter 1-7 we discovered the rings In by looking at congruence classes 
of integers modulo n. For n a prime, In turned out to be a field. 
In this chapter we do the same construction with polynomials. By doing 
so, we shall discover vast collections of new fields, some of which will tum 
out to be very useful. 
We first look at examples. 
ExAMPLE 1. In O[ x) consider congruence modulo the polynomial x 2 - 2. 
We shall say that 
a(x) = b(x) 
if x 2 - 2 divides a(x) - b(x), or if 
(modx2 -2) 
a(x) = b(x) + q(x)(x2 - 2) 
for some polynomial q(x) in O[x). Thus 
etc. 
x2 == 2 (mod x2 - 2), 
x3 == 2x (mod x 2 - 2), 
X4 -
2X2 + I == 1 (mod x2 - 2), 
x9 == 4xs (mod x2 - 2), 
Write [J(X»)x2-2 for the congruence class mod x2 - 2: two polynomials 
are in the same congruence class mod x 2 - 2 if they are congruent mod x2 
- 2. Define addition and multiplication of congruence classes, just as in 

232 
7 Congruence Classes Modulo a Polynomial: Simple Field Extensions 
[f(x)]x2_2 + [g(X)]x2_2 = [f(x) + g(x) Jx2-2' 
[f(x) Jx2-2 . [g(X)]x2_2 = [f(x)g(x) Jx2-2' 
These operations make the set of congruence classes into a ring which we 
shall call Q[x]/(x2 - 2). Each congruence class in Q[x]/(x2 - 2) has a nice 
representative, found by the division theorem. If f(x) is in Q[x], 
f(x) = (x2 - 2)q(x) + r(x) 
where r(x) is unique and has degree < 1: r(x) = a + bx for some unique 
a, b, in Q. Then [J(X)]x2-2 = [r(x)]x2_2 = [a + bX]x2_2 = [a]x2-2 + [b]x2-2' 
[X]x2-2' 
We can think of Q as being a subset of Q[x]/(x2 - 2) by identifying a 
in Q with [a]x2_2' (For if [a]x2-2 = [b]x2_2' then a = b, for a, b in Q.) Thus 
every element of Q[x]/(x2 - 2) is an element of Q plus a Q-multiple of 
[X]x2_2' If we abbreviate [X]x2-2 by a, then every such element of Q[x]/(x2 
- 2) is of the form a + ba, with a, b in Q. 
It is convenient to think of elements of Q[x]/(x2 - 2) as polynomials in 
Q[x] evaluated at a = [X]x2_2 where 
a2 = [X]2 
= [X2] 
= [X2 - 2 + 2] 
x2-2 
x2-2 
x2-2 
= [X2 - 2Jx2_2 + [2Jx2_2 = 2. 
(Of course a is not a number in the usual sense, but a congruence class, an 
invented element satisfying a2 = 2.) Then addition and multiplication are 
the same as for polynomials: for example, 
(a + ba)(c + da) = ac + (ad + bc)a + bda2. 
To express this result as a polynomial in a of degree < 1, we use the fact 
that a 2 = 2 to get 
(a + ba)(c + da) = ac + 2bd + (ad + bc)a. 
We note that Q[x]/(x2 - 2) is in fact a field. For if a or b "1= 0, 
(a+ba)[(a-ba)' 2 1 2] = 1 
(a - 2b ) 
provided that the rational numbers a, b do not satify a2 - 2b2 = O. But if 
a2 - 2b2 = 0, b "1= 0 "1= a, then aj b is a rational root of x2 - 2. But x2 - 2 
has no rational roots because x2 - 2 is irreducible in Q[x] (why?). 
EXAMPLE 2. In R[ x] the polynomial x2 + 1 is irreducible. Let R[ x]/ (x2 + 1) 
be the set of congruence classes of polynomials modulo x2 + 1. Then by 
the division theorem, there are a, b in R so that 
[f(X)]x2+1 =[a+bxJx2+1 = a+b[x] 
where, as in Example 1, we identify a real number with its congruence 

7 Congruence Classes Modulo a Polynomial: Simple Field Extensions 
233 
class modulo x2 + 1. If we abbreviate [x]x2+ 1= i, then x2 == - 1 (mod x2 
+ 1), so P = [x]2 = [x2] = [-1] = - 1, and the elements of R[x]/(x2 + 1) 
are of (he form a + bi, a, b in R. We multiply as if the elements were 
polynomials in i, and then use the equation P = - 1. 
Then R[x1/(x2 + 1) looks just like C. 
EXAMPLE 3. We invent a field with 8 elements. Look at Z2[X1/(X3 + x + 1), 
congruence classes in Z2[ x] modulo x3 + x + 1. 
By the division theorem, namely J(x) = q(x)(x3 + X + 1) + r(x), any 
polynomial in Z2[ x] is congruent modulo x3 + x + 1 to a polynomial of 
degree .;;;; 2. So any congruence class can be represented by a polynomial 
of degree';;;; 2. There are exactly 8 of these. So Z2[x1/(X3 + X + 1) consists 
of [0] = 0, [1] = 1, [x], [x + 1] = [x] + 1, [x2] = [xf, [x2 + 1] = [X]2 + 1, [x2 
+ x] = [X]2 + [x], and [x2 + x + 1] = [xf + [x] + 1. These are all the poly-
nomials 111 [x] with coefficients in Z2 of degree .;;;; 2. We multiply these 
elements like polynomials and then, to get the product again as a poly-
nomial of degree .;;;; 2, use the equation [X]3 = [x] + 1. 
. 
Setting [x] = a we get the following multiplication table.

Notice that every nonzero element has an inverse so that (assuming 
multiplication is associative, which it is) we have the multiplication table 
for a field. 
Here is the general case. 
Let F be a field, p(x) be a polynomial in F[x] of degree> 1. Say that 
J(x) = g(x) (modp(x» 
if p(x) divides J(x) - g(x). Write [J(x)]p(x) = 

234 
7 Congruence Qasses Modulo a Polynomial: Simple Field Extensions 
[g(x)]p(x) if f(x) = g(x) (modp(x»; [J(x)]p(x) is the congruence class of 
f( x) and is the set of all those polynomials in F[ x] which are congruent to 
f(x) modulo p(x). Let F[x]/p(x) be the collection of all the congruence 
classes in F[x] modulo p(x). We shall write [.f(x)] instead of [f(x)]p(x) when 
no confusion can arise. 
We first notice that the function which takes a in F to [a] in F[x]/p(x) 
is I-I. For if [a] = [b], a, b in F, then p(x) must divide a-b. But 
deg(p(x» ~ I, so a - b must be the zero polynomial, and thus a = bin F. 
Therefore we may identify a and [a] in F[x]/p(x). 
Addition and multiplication of congruence classes are defined by addi-
tion and multiplication of representatives (see E9). Thus 
[f(x) ] + [g(x)] = [f(x) + g(x)], 
and 
[f(x)] . [g(x)] = [f(x)g(x) J. 
Using these rules, we can write a typical element of F[x]/p(x) as 
[aO+a1x+··· +arxr] =[ao] +[ad[x] + ... +[ar][xY 
which, with the identification of a and [a], for a in F, can be written 
ao + a1 [ x] + . . . + ar[ x y, 
a polynomial in [x]p(x). If we abbreviate [x]p(x) by a, then this becomes 
ao + ala + ... + arar, 
so a typical element of F[x]/p(x) can be thought of as a polynomial with 
coefficients in F evaluated at the congruence class [x)p(x) = a, where 
p(a) = 0 (since p(a) = [p(x)]p(x) = [O]p(x». With these changes in notation, 
we shall sometimes denote F[x]/p(x) by F[a], when we are sure no one 
will forget that a = [x]p(x) andp(a) = o. 
If p(x) has degree d, then every element of F[a) is a linear combination 
of I, a, a 2, a3, ••• , ad-I. For given any polynomialf(x) in F[x), there is a 
unique polynomial r(x) of degree < d such that 
f(x) = p(x)q(x) + r(x). 
Thus there is a unique polynomial of degree < d, namely r(x), to which 
f(x) is congruent modp(x). So every polynomial in F[a] is equal to a 
unique polynomial in a of degree < d, thus is a unique F-linear combina-
tion of I, a, a2, ••• ,ad-I. 
If we think of F[x]/p(x) = F[a) as polynomials in a, then addition 
and multiplication in F[a) is the same as addition and multiplication 
of polynomials, evaluated at a. To express f(a)g(a) as a polynomial of 
degree < d in a, use the division theorem: f(x)g(x) = p(x)q(x) + r(x) with 
deg(r(x» < d = deg(p(x». Then f(a)g(a) = r(a). Convenient data to have 
when multiplying in F[ a) = F[ x]/ p( x) is a table expressing powers of 
a = [x) between d and 2d - 2 in terms of polynomials in a of degree < d.

Theorem. F[x]/ p(x) is a commutative ring with unity. It is a field if p(x) is 
irreducible in F[ x]. 
The converse is also true. See EIO. 
PROOF. The fact that F[x]/p(x) satisfies the axioms for a commutative ring 
with unity follows from the fact that F[x] satisfies those same axioms. For 
example, to show the commutative law for multiplication, takef, g in F[x]. 
Then 
[f][g] =[f·g] =[g·f] =[g][f], 
the middle inequality following from the fact that multiplication is com-
mutative in F[x]. The other axioms are handled in a similar fashion. 
To show that F[x]/p(x) is a field if p(x) is irreducible, we must check 
the axiom that nonzero elements have inverses. 
Suppose p( x) is irreducible. If f( x) is any polynomial, nonzero, of degree 
<d, thenf(x) andp(x) are relatively prime, so by Bezout's lemma we can 
write 
f(x)a(x) + p(x)b(x) == 1. 
Then, if 0'.= [x]p(x)' evaluating this last equation at a and noting that 
pea) = 0, we getf(a)a(a) = 1 in F[a] = F[x]/p(x), sof(a) has an inverse in 
F[a]. Since every nonzero element of F[a] has an inverse, F[a] is then a

We now have a way of inventing many new fields. Take an irreducible 
polynomialp(x) in F[x], and consider F[x]/p(x)-it will be a field. Our 
three examples above were all fields. 
A field of the form F[x]/p(x) is called a simple field extension of F. 
Here are some other examples: 
Z3[X]/(X2 + I)-called GF(9), it has 9 elements; 
Z2[X]/(X2 + x + I)-a field with 4 elements; 
Q[x]/(x6 + 2x + 2)-this looks like complex numbers which are poly-
nomials in a with rational coefficients, where a in C is a root of x 6 + 2x + 
2· , 
Z2[X]/(X4 + X + I)-a field with 16 elements; 
Z3[X]/(X3 + 2x + I)-a field with 27 elements; 
Zp[x]/(x2 + I) for p == 3 (mod 4)-this looks just like the field Zp[i] 
which we invented in Chapter 4.

7 Congruence Classes Modulo a Polynomial: Simple Field Extensions 
We know by Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion that in Q[x] there are 
irreducible polynomials of any degree ~ 1. So given any d > 1 there is a 
field F containing Q whose dimension as a vector space over Q is d. We 
shall see later that the same fact will be true for lLp as well.

exhibiting nonzero elements of F[x]/p(x) which are zero divisors. 

Polynomials and Roots 8 
A. Inventing Roots of Polynomials 
Perhaps the main reason for the invention of complex numbers was the 
fact that certain polynomials in R[x] had no roots in R, for example 
x 2 + 1, x 2 + X + 1, x 2 + 2, etc. By defining C, the complex numbers, 
mathematicians provided "imaginary" roots for these polynomials, by, in 
essence, inventing them. 
Now C looks just like R[x]/(x2 + 1). In fact, as we observed in the last 
section, if you write the elements of R[x]/(x2 + 1) as a + b[x]x2+1 and 
then set [X]x2+l = i, there is no difference between R[X]/(X2 + 1) and C: 
the elements look the same, add the same way, multiply the same way. Of 
course i is a root of x 2 + 1, for 
i2 + 1 = [ x ] [ x] + 1 = [ x 2 + 1 Jx2+ I = [0 Jx2+ I = O. 
If 16th-century mathematicians can invent C to provide roots of poly-
nomials with real coefficients we can do the same kind of thing with other 
polynomials. In fact, we already have the following 
Theorem. Let F be a field, p( x) an irreducible polynomial in F[ x]. Then there 
is a field K containing F which has a root of p( x). 
PROOF. The field K is F[x]/(p(x». The root of p(x) is [x]p(x). You verify 
the details.

We can do even better: 
Corollary. Let F be afield,f(x) a (monic) polynomial of degree ~ I in F[x]. 
Then there exists afield K containing F such that in K[x],f(x)factors into a 
product of linear factors. 

238 
8 Polynomials and Roots 
PROOF. Induction on deg(f(x» == d. 
The case deg(f(x» == 1 is trivial. 
Let f(x) have degree d. In F[x),f(x) == PI(X) ... Ps(x), a product of 
irreducible polynomials. If deg(p;(x» == 1 for all i == 1, ... , s, then the 
field K we are looking for is F itself. Otherwise, suppose (renumbering if 
necessary) that deg(PI(x» > 1. Let L == F[y1/(Pl(Y» == F[a). Then L is a 
field containing F, and a is a root in L of PI(X), so in L[x),PI(x) == (x -
a)ql(x). Thus, in L[x),f(x) == (x - a)ql(x)P2(x) ... Ps(x). Let g(x) == 
ql(X)P2(X) ... pix). Now deg(g(x» == deg(f(x» - 1. By induction there is 
a field K -::J L such that in K[x), g(x) factors into a product of linear 
factors. But if g(x) does, so does f(x) == (x - a)g(x). That completes the 
proof. 
0 
A field K is called a splitting field for f(x) if f(x) factors into linear 
factors in K[x). 
EXAMPLE. In Q[ x), f( x) == x3 - 2 is irreducible. It has a root in IR, namely 
V'l , but IR is not a splitting field for f(x) because in lR[x), 
x 3 - 2 == (x - V'l )( x2 + V'l X + V'4 ) 
and the second factor is irreducible in IR[ x). On the other hand, C is a 
splitting field for f(x), for if w == (-1 + v:=-3 )/2, then in C[x), 
x 3 - 2 == (x - V'l )(x - wV'l )(x - w2V'l). 
Of course, C is a splitting field for any polynomial in Q[x) because of the 
fundamental theorem of algebra. 
El. Prove the theorem. 
*E2. Find a field F containing 12 which contains all roots of f(x) == X 16 - x. 
Describe F in the form 12[xJ/(p(x» for some polynomialp(x). (Hint: recall 
the generalization of Fermat's theorem in Chapter 1-11.) 
E3. Show that the field F[xJ/(p(x» is in fact a splitting field for p(x) in F[xJ, in 
case 
(a) F== 12,p(x) = x3 + X + 1, 
(b) F== 12'p(x) == X4 + X + 1, 
(c) F== 13'p(x) == x3 + 2x + 1, 
(d) F is any field, p(x) has degree 2. 
B. Finding Polynomials with Given Roots 
Let F be a field, K be a field containing F. Let a be in K. Suppose a is the 
root of some nonzero polynomial f( x) in F[ x). Then we say that a is 
algebraic over F. 

B Finding Polynomials with Given Roots 
239 
Proposition 1. Let a in K be algebraic over F. Then there is a unique monic 
irreducible polynomial p(x) in F[x] with a as a root, and every polynomial 
f(x) in F[x] with a as a root is a multiple of p(x). 
We callp(x) the minimal polynomial of a over F, because, as we shall see 
in the proof, it is a polynomial of minimal degree in F[x] having a as a 
root. 
EXAMPLE. Let F = IR, K = C, a be in C. Suppose a = a + bi, b =1= O. Then 
the minimal polynomial of a is 
(x - a)(x - a) = x 2 - 2ax + (a2 + b2), 
as we showed in Chapter II-4. 
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1. Since a is the root of some nonzero polynomial 
with coefficients in F, there is a nonzero monic polynomialp(x) of smallest 
degree with a as a root (by well-ordering on the set of degrees of 
polynomials in F[x] with a as a root). We show that p(x) is irreducible. 
Otherwise, p(x) = a(x)b(x) with both deg(a(x)) and deg(b(x)) < 
deg(p(x)); then 0 = pea) = a(a)b(a). Since K is a field, either a(a) = 0 
or b(a) = O. Thus a is a root of a polynomial of degree smaller than 
deg(p(x)), which is a contradiction. Thus p(x) is irreducible. Finally, 
suppose f( x) is any polynomial in F[ x] with a as a root. By the division 
theorem, 
f(x) = p(x)q(x) + rex) with deg(r(x» < deg(p(x». 
Setting x = a yields 0 = rea). By choice of p(x), rex) must be the zero 
polynomial, and so p(x) dividesf(x). That completes the proof.

In the next chapter we shall be interested in finding minimal polynomi-
als over 7L2 of elements of GF(l6). The next proposition shows that they 
will exist, and the proof describes how to find them. 
Proposition 2. Let K = F[a] be a simple field extension of F, where the 
minimal polynomial p(x) of a over F has degree d. Then if f3 is any element 
of K, f3 is algebraic over F, and the minimal polynomial of f3 over F has 
degree < d. 
PROOF. To prove this, we need the following fact from linear algebra (see 
Chapter 1-9): Any system of n homogeneous linear equations in n + 1 
unknowns has a nonzero solution. 
Each element of K = F[a] is a polynomial in a of degree < d - 1. In 
particular, each power of f3 is such a polynomial in a. Thus 
1 = 1, 
f3 = al,o + aI, la + ... + al,d_lad- l, 
f32 = a2,O + a2, la + ... + a2,d_la d-I, 

240 
8 Polynomials and Roots 
We look for a nonzero solution of 
0= Xo + x l f3 + X2f3 2 + ... + Xdf3 d. 
Substituting, we get 
o = Xo + xl(al,o + aI, 10: + ... + al,d_lo:d- l) + ... 
+Xiad,O+ad,IO:+'" 
+ad,d_lo:d- I). 
Collecting coefficients of powers of 0: gives 
Xo + al,oxl + ... +ad,Oxd=O, 
al,lxl + ... + ad, IXd=O, 
This is a set of d equations in the d + 1 unknowns Xo, ... , Xd• So we can 
find a solution Xo = ro, XI = rl, ... , Xd = rd of these equations with 
ro, r\> ... , rd not all zero. But then 
o = ro + rlx + r2x 2 + ... + rdxd = f(x) 
is a nonzero polynomial of degree ~ d in F[ x] with f3 as a root. That 
completes the proof. 
D 
While in the proof of Proposition 2 we needed some linear algebra 
theory, in any case in practice we simply solve a particular set of equa-
tions, knowing from the theory invoked in Proposition 2 that the set of 
equations will have a solution. 
EXAMPLE. Let K = Z2[X]/(X3 + X + 1) = Z2[0:]. Then 0:3 + 0: + 1 = 0 and K 
consists of polynomials in 0: of degree 
~ 2 with coefficients in Z2' A 
description of the elements of K is found in Table 1 in Chapter 111-9 
below. 
What is the minimal polynomial over Z2 of 0:2 + I? We write the powers 
of 0:2 + 1 in terms of 1,0:, 0:2, using Table 1 of Chapter 111-9 as follows: 
1 = 1, 
We solve 

B Finding Polynomials with Given Roots 
Collecting coefficients of powers of a, we get 
Xo + x I + x 2 = 0, 
X2 + X3 = 0, 
XI + x 2 + X3 = 0, 
241 
which we solve in 7L2• We get XI = 0, Xo = X 2 = X3. Thus the minimal 
polynomial of a 2 + lover 7L2 is x3 + x2 + 1. 
E4. With a = [xlx3+x+ 1 as in the example, find the minimal polynomial over 12 of 
(a) a2 + a, 
(b) a 2 + a + I.

Error-Correcting Codes, II 
In Chapter 1-13, we looked at ways of coding messages so that if in the 
transmission an error occurred in one of the digits of a coded word, the 
receiver would be able to correct the error. Those codes, called Hamming 
codes, were based on defining coded words as vectors of solutions in I2 to 
sets of linear equations. 
In this chapter we will use finite fields to describe some multiple-error-
correcting codes. These codes, called BCH codes, were discovered in 1960 
by Bose, Chaudhuri and Hocquenghem. The coded words in these codes 
will be vectors which are the coefficients of polynomials in I2[ x]. The 
polynomials will have as roots certain powers of a primitive element of 
some appropriate field extension of I2' 
The first example uses a field of 8 elements. 
Let m(x) = x 3 + X + 1 in I2[x]. It is easy to see that m(x) is irreducible 
in I2[x], and so I2[x]/m(x) is a field with 8 elements. Denote the 
congruence class of x, [x]m(x), by a; then I2[x]/ m(x) can be viewed as 
polynomials in a, where a3 + a + I = 0, and so we shall denote 
I2[x]/m(x) by I2[a]. It turns out that a is a primitive element of I2[a]. In 
fact, the elements of I2[ a] may be described as powers of a as in Table l.

Our first code, like one in Chapter 1-13, sends out coded words of length 
7 with 4 information digits. 
Code III (codes I and II were the Hamming codes of Chapter 1-13). For 
the coding, let (a, b, c, d) be the information digits which we wish to 
transmit. Form the polynomial 
Cj(x) = ax6 + bx 5 + cx4 + dx3• 
Divide Clx) by m(x) = x 3 + X + 1: 
where the remainder CR(x) has degree < deg(m(x». Then 
CR(x) = rx 2 + sx + t 
for some r, s, t in 7L2• Since -1 = 1 in 7L2, we get 
= C(x), 
and so the polynomial C(x) has the important property that when 
evaluated at a, a root of m(x), we have 
C(a) = m(a)q(a) = o. 
The coded word is C = (a, b, c, d, r, s, t), the coefficients of the poly-
nomial C(x). Then C has 4 information digits. It is characterized by the 
property that it corresponds to the unique polynomial of degree 6 with 
given top degree coefficients a, b, c, d and having a as a root. 
For the decoding, suppose the receiver receives (A, B, C, D, R, S, T). 
Form the polynomial 
R(x) = Ax6 + Bx5 + CX4 + Dx 3 + Rx 2 + Sx + T. 
Suppose that at most one error occurred. Then C(x) - R(x) = E(x) is 
either the zero polynomial or consists of a single term, xe, whose 
coefficient in R(x) was erroneous. To decide, look at R(a): 
Case O. If R(a) = 0, then, since C(a) = 0, E(a) = 0 and no errors occurred. 
Case 1. If R(a) = a e, then, since C(a) = 0, E(a) = a e and one error 
occurred, at the coefficient of xe. 
Thus by evaluating R(x) at x = a, we can decide whether an error 
occurred and, if so, where, so that the error can be corrected. 
If two or more errors occurred, and we think at most one error 
occurred, we would be misled. But if more than one error is very unlikely 
to occur, this is a good code. 

244

x 3 + X + 1.

The remainder is CR(x) = 1. So C(x) = x 6 + x 5 + x 3 + 1. (Note that C(a) 
= a 6 + a 5 + a 3 + 1 = (a2 + 1) + (a2 + a + 1) + (a + 1) + 1 = 0.) 
Send (1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1). 
If we receive (1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1), we find R(a), where 
R(x) = x 6 + x 5 + x 3 + x 2 + 1. 
Then, from Table 1, we get R(a) as follows. 
1 = 
+a2 =a2 
+a3 = 
a + 1 
+a5 =a2 +a + 1 
+a6 = a 2 
+ 1 
R(a) =a2• 
So we change the coefficient of x 2 in R(x), and our corrected word is 
(1, 1, 0, 1, ~, 0, 1). 
El. Code the messages 
(a) (1,0,0,0), 
(b) (0, 1, 1,0), 
(c) (1, 1, 1, 0). 
E2. Decode the received words 
(a) (1, 1, 1,0, 0, 0, 1), 
(b) (1,0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1), 
(c) (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0). 
Our second code is set up similarly to the first, but needs a bigger field. 
Let m(x) = X4 + X + 1 in l2[X]. It is not hard to see that m(x) is 
irreducible, and so l2[ x]/ m( x) is a field which we shall call l2[ a] or 
GF(16), the former because we shall let [x]m(x) = a, the latter because the

245 
field has 16 elements in it. It turns out that a is a primitive element of 
GF(l6). Thus every element of Z2[a] is a power of a. This is exhibited in 
Table 2, which like Table 1 in the example above, will supply convenient 
data for decoding.

We use GF(16) to construct a code which corrects two errors. The idea 
for coding is to use for code words vectors of length 15 which are the 
coefficients of polynomials of degree 14 in Z2[a] having a and £1'3 as roots. 
We know that the polynomial of smallest degree in Z2[X] with a as a 
root is m(x) = X4 + X + 1. We have to find the minimal polynomial over 
Z2 of a3. To do this, observe that every element of Z2[a] is a Z2-linear 
combination of 1, a, £1'2, £1'3. So in the equation 
o = a + ba3 + ca6 + da9 + ea 12, 
if we write £1'6, £1'9, a 12 in terms of 1, a, £1'2, £1'3 by Table 2 we get four 
equations in the five unknowns a, b, c, d, e in Z2; any solution will give us 
the coefficients of a polynomial in Z2[X] with £1'3 as a root. 
Doing so, we get 
o = a + ba3 + c( £1'3 + £1'2) + d( £1'3 + a) + e( £1'3 + £1'2 + a + 1). 
Collecting coefficients gives the equations 
a + e = 0, 
d + e = 0, 
c + e = 0, 
b + c + d + e = 0, 

246 
9 Error-Correcting Codes, II 
so a = b = c = d = e, and the only nonzero solution is when they are all 
equal to 1. The only nonzero polynomial of degree .;;; 4 satisfied by a3 is 
therefore 
1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + X4 = mix), 
which must be irreducible. 
The polynomial of smallest degree with both a and a 3 as roots is the 
least common multiple of m(x) and m3(x); since they are both irreducible 
in Z2[X], that is the same as their product m 13(x) = m(x)mix) = XS + x 7 + 
x 6 + X4 + 1. 
Since m13(x) has degree 8 we are going to send out words of length 15 
with 7 information digits. 
Note the important fact (see Theorem 1 of Chapter 11-10) that if p(x) is 
a polynomial in Z2[X], thenp(x2) = (p(x)i, Thus if a is a root of m(x), so 
are a2 and a4• 
E3. Prove (using the binomial theorem and induction on the degree) that any 
polynomial p(x) with coefficients in 7L2 has the property that (p(X))2 = p(x2). 
Code IV. We encode as follows. Let (a I4, a13, ... , as) be the informa-
tion word. Let C/(x) = al4xl4 + a 13x 13 + ... + asxs. Divide C/(x) by 
ml3(x): 
C/(x) = ml3(x)q(x) -
CR(x), 
where CR(x), the remainder, has degree .;;; 7, 
CR(x) = a7x 7 + ... + a1x + ao· 
Then 
C(x) = al4xl4 + ... + a1x + ao = CR(x) + Cix) = ml3(x)q(x), 
has a and a3 as roots, and (since the remainder in the division algorithm is 
unique) is the unique polynomial of degree .;;; 14 with given coefficients 
a14, ... , as and with a and a 3 as roots. 
Let C = (a I4, a13, ... , ao). Send C. [Note the interplay between a poly-
nomial as a formal sum of powers of x, and as an n-tuple of coefficients. 
Recall Chapter II-I.] 
For decoding, suppose we receive R. Set R = C + E, where E is the error 
vector. Think of R, C, E as polynomials. Then, since m 13(x) divides C(x): 
R(a) = £(a), because m13(a) = 0; 
R(a2) = £(a2), because ml3(a) = 0, hence m13(a2) = (m13(a»2 = 0; 
R(a 3) = £(a3), because m13(a3) = O. 
Consider the polynomial 
R(a)x2 + R(a2)x + (R(a3) + R(a)R(a2)) = P(x). 
We assume £(x) = R(x) - C(x) has at most two nonzero terms in it. 

9 Error-Correcting Codes, II 
Case 0. If E(x) = 0, thenp(x) = 0. 
Case 1. If E(x) = x e, then 
P{x) = a ex2 + a2ex + (a3e + a2ea) = (aex){x + ae). 
Case 2. If E(x) = x e + xl, then 
247 
P(x) = Cae + af)x2 + (a2e + a2I)x + (a3e + a3f) + (a2e + a2I)(a e + af) 
= Cae + af)[ x2 + Cae + af)x + aeaI] 
= (a e + af)[ (x + ae)(x + af)]. 
Thus, if there are roots of P(x), then the roots are the powers of a 
corresponding to the errors. So we receive R, compute P(x), and find its 
roots. 
This code therefore corrects two errors.

So CR(x) = x7 + x5 + X4 + x2 + x and the coded word is 
(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0). 
Suppose we receive 
(I, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0). 
We compute R(a), R(a2), R(a3): 
R(a) = a l4 + a l3 + a" + a lO + a9 + as + a5 + a4 + a2 + a; 
R(a2) = (R(a»2 
(since the field has characteristic 2); 
R(a3) = a42 + a39 + a33 + a 30 + a27 + a24 + a l5 + a l2 + a6 + a3.

To generalize the ideas of these codes in order to get codes which 
correct more than two errors, it is useful to use the notion of row rank of a 
matrix (Section 1-9F). So for the remainder of this chapter we shall assume 
some acquaintance with Chapter 1-9. 
To introduce the matrix techniques, we describe anew how to decode 
code IV. We decoded above by using the polynomial P(x), which appeared 
in a rather mysterious manner. We shall here use, instead, a matrix. 
Let R(ai) = Si for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. 
Let 
Using this 2 X 2 matrix with entries in GF(16) we can correct 0, 1, or 2 
errors as follows: 
Case O. No errors. Then E(x) = 0, so S = 0 (and in particular, the row rank 
of S is 0). 
Case 1. One error. Then E(x) = Xi for some i, 0..;; i ..;; 14; thus 
S= ( ai 
a 2i 
The second row is a i times the first row. So S has (row) rank 1. We can 
correct the received vector R by changing the digit corresponding to Xi 
(where i is known from R(a) = a i). 
Case 2. Two errors. Then 
(~i ~i)(~i ~i)C 
:~). 
so is nonsingular, hence has row rank 2. 
We see that the rank of S = the number of errors. 
With two errors, E(x) = Xi + xi. We find i and j in two steps, as 
foIIows.

9 Error-Correcting Codes, II 
We can solve (a) because S is nonsingular, so in fact we can use the 
inverse of S, which for 2 X 2 matrices is easy to wrlte down. There will be a 
unique solution. 
E6. Show that in fact (7, = R(a), (72 = (R(a 3)/ R(a» + R(a2), so that R(a)pix) = 
P(x), the mysterious polynomial used in decoding code IV. 
The reason we want to solve (b) is that the roots in GF(16) of x 2 + 0IX 
+ 02 = 0 turn out to be a i and a j , the powers of a corresponding to where 
the errors occur in R(x). To see this, we examine the coefficients of 
(x - ai)(x -
a j ) = x 2 + 7",X + 7"2 in GF(l6)[x]. They satisfy 
a 2i + 7"lai + 7"2 == 0, 
a 2j + 7"laj + 7"2 = o. 
Multiplying the equations (3) by a i and aj respectively gives 
a 3i + 7"la2i + 7"2ai = 0, 
and 
Adding, we get 
S3 + 7",S2 + 7"2SI = o. 
(3) 
Similarly, multiplying the two equations (3) by a 2i and a 2j respectively and 
adding, we get 
S4 + 7"IS3 + 7"2S2 = o. 
Putting these last two equations together in matrix form (noting + = - in 
1':2)' gives 
Since there was a unique solution of this equation, therefore 7"1 = a" 7"2 = 
O2. 
The way we solve x 2 + o,x + O2 = 0 is by "brute force," as we did 
before. There are only two roots and only 15 candidates, so start trying 
x = 1, a, a 2, a 3, ... , a'4 until two of them solve the equation. 
To sum up: this code sends words of length 15, of which 7 are 
information digits. The receiver can decide whether 0, 1, or 2 errors 
occurred, and correct them. 
E7. Using the matrix S, decode 
(a) (110, 001, 1l0, 010, 1l0), 
(b) (101, Oll, 1l0, 010, 110), 
(c) (110, 010, lll, 1l0, 110).

ES. (This and the following exercise assume understanding of the Hamming codes 
I and II of Chapter 1-13.) Is the two-error-correcting code, code IV, a 
Hamming code of the kind described in Chapter 1-I3? Is there a coding matrix 
iI of the type used in codes I and II such that if Cis a 15-tuple, with given first 
7 digits, then C is a code word if and only if HC = O? If there is such an H, 
write it down. 
E9. Find a matrix H with the property that given a vector v which is the sum of 
two columns of H, v can be written as such a sum in exactly one way. 
Our next example is a code which corrects three errors in words of 
length 15. We shall use GF(l6) as in our last example, and some matrix 
theory. 
We find the polynomial in l2[X] of smallest degree which has a, a3, and 
as as roots. It turns out to be m135(x) = m\3(x)ms(x), where ms(x) = x 2 + X 
+ I is the minimal polynomial of as. So m\35 has degree 10, and we are 
allowed 5 information digits, (aI4' ... , alO)' Note that m135(x) has a 2, a4, 
and a6 as roots also, by Exercise E3. 
Code V. For coding, let C/(x) = al4xl4 + ... + alOxlO. Divide C/(x) 
by m\35(x) to get a remainder CR(x) of degree .;;;; 9; then C(x) = C/(x) + 
CR(x) is a multiple of ml35(x) and is the unique polynomial of degree';;;; 14

We consider the matrix 
Case O. No errors. E(x) = O. Then S = O. 
Case 1. One error. E(x) = Xi. Then 
has (row) rank 1, and the single error is at the ith spot.

and the row space of S is the two-dimensional space over GF(16) spanned 
by (ai, a 2i, a~i) and (aj , a 2j, a 3j). We can let S(2) be the invertible matrix 
S(2) = (SI

a 3i + a 3j + a 3k 
a 4i + a4i + a 4k 
is invertible, so has rank 3. 
For these matrices S, the rank and the number of errors can be 
computed by looking at the square matrices in the upper left-hand corners. 
Let 
S(I) = (SI)' 
S(2) = ( SI 
S2 
S2 ) 
S3 ' 
S(3) = S. 
Then 
rank S = 0 if det S(I) = 0, 
rank S = I if det S(I) =1= 0 but det S(2) = 0, 
rank S = 2 if det S(2) =1= 0 but det S(3) = 0, 
rank S = 3 if det S(3) =1= O. 
EIO. If ai, aj , a k are all distinct, show that S is nonsingular. Generalize to n X n S 
with a \ a \ ... , a in all distinct. 
Since S is invertible, we can solve uniquely the equation 
s[::l 
l~:l for ",,",". 
and then find the roots in GF(16) of 
x 3 + 171X 2 + 172X + 173 = O. 
The three roots of this equation will be ai, a j , a k , the powers of a 
corresponding to where the three errors are. 
Ell. Fill in the details of this last sentence. 
So the receiver can decode by 
(l) finding the row rank of the matrix S, which tells the number of errors 
(up to 3), 
(2) finding where the errors are by the techniques described above. 

9 Error-Correcting Codes, II 
253 
These codes generalize. Unfortunately, when working with words of 
length 15, if a code which corrects 4 errors is desired, one is allowed only 1 
information digit, so the repetition code described in Chapter 1-13 would 
work as well. But if longer words are permitted, GF(32) can be used to 
send out coded words of length 31, with 10 information digits and with up 
to 5 errors correctable, or with 6 information digits and with up to 7 errors 
correctible. Or GF(64) can be used to send out coded words of length 63 as 
follows: 
30 information digits, up to 6 errors correctable; 
24 information digits, up to 7 errors correctable; 
18 information digits, up to 10 errors correctable; 
J6 information digits, up to 11 errors correctable; 
10 information digits, up to 13 errors correctable; 
7 information digits, up to 15 errors correctable. 
All of these codes are designed the same way as our last code, which 
corrected 3 errors. 
E12. How would you go about designing one of these codes with GF(32) or 
GF(64)7 
Good expositions of algebraic coding theory include Berlekamp (1968), 
Peterson and Weldon (1972), and Blake and Mullen (1975). 
E13. The coder, using code IV, is sending out 15-bit words, coefficients of a

Isomorphisms, I 10 
A. Definitions 
This chapter is about functions from one ring to another. 
When we define a function in algebra, we specify three things: a set R, 
the domain of the function; a set S, the range of the function; and the 
functionf, which assigns to each element r of R a unique elementf(r) of S. 
When we call S the range, we mean only that S acts as a target for f, not 
that every element s of S has the form s = f(r) for some r in R. The set of 
elements s of S with s = f(r) for some r in R is called the image of f. 
If Rand S are commutative rings, then we are particularly interested in 
functions f from R to S which preserve the ring properties of R and S. 
How do we say this more precisely? 
A ring is a set with operations + (addition), . (multiplication), and -
(negation), and with distinguished elements 0 and 1, satisfying a certain set 
of axioms (see Chapter 1-8). A functionffrom a ring R to a ring S is a ring 
homomorphism if 
(i) f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) in S for all a, b in R, 
(ii) f(a·b) = f(a) ·f(b) in S for all a, bin R, and 
(iii) f(lR) = Is, where lR, Is are the multiplicative identities of R, S, 
respectively. 
It turns out that if f satisfies the conditions (i)-(iii), then 
(iv) f(OR) = Os: 
for 
feb) = f(OR + b) = f(OR) + feb), 

256 
and adding - J( b) to both sides gives 
Also, 
(v) J( - a) = - J(a): 
for 
Os = J(OR) + Os = J(OR)' 
10 Isomorphisms, I 
Os = J(OR) = J(a + (-a» = J(a) + J( -a), 
so that J( - a) is a negative for J(a) in S, and since negatives are unique, 
J( - a) = - J(a). Also 
(vi) if a has an inverse a-I in R, so that a'a- 1 = 1, thenJ(a)-1 = J(a- 1): 
the proof is an easy consequence of the fact that inverses in a commutative 
ring are unique. 
El. Prove that iff is a ring homomorphism, then/(a- 1) = /(a)-I. 
Thus a function which preserves addition and multiplication and sends 
identity to identity also sends zero to zero, negatives to negatives, and 
inverses to inverses. 
A ring homomorphism J is 1-1 if it is 1-1 as a function, that is, 
J(a) = J(b) implies a = b. It is not hard to show thatJis 1-1 if OR' the zero 
element of R, is the only element a in R with J(a) = Os. 
El. Prove this. 
A ring homomorphismJ from R to S is onto (or surjective) if it is onto 
as a function, that is, the image of J in S is all of S, that is, for every s in S 
there is some r in R with J(r) = s. Note that for the concept "onto" to 
make sense, the range S of the function J must be included as part of the 
definition. See Example 2 below. 
A ring homomorphism J is called an isomorphism if J is 1-1 and onto. 
If J : R ~ S is an isomorphism, then R and S are isomorphic, and we 
shall write R:::::: S. R:::::: S means that even if R and S look different, 
nonetheless in terms of their algebraic structure they are not (see Example 
12, below). 
The rest of this chapter is devoted to examples of ring homomorphisms. 
EXAMPLE 1. The most trivial example is the identity homomorphism. Let R 
be a commutative ring, and define a function i : R~R by i(r) = r for all r 
in R. It is very easy to check that i is a ring homomorphism and is 1-1 and 
onto. 
EXAMPLE 2. Let S be a commutative ring, and let R be a subset of S which 
is also a commutative ring with the same addition and multiplication that 

B Examples Involving 1. 
257 
S has, and such that the identity and zero elements of S are the identity 
and zero elements for R respectively. For example, let S be the complex 
numbers and R be the real numbers, or the rational numbers. We can then 
define a homomorphism i from R to S, called the inclusion map, by 
i(r) = the element r thought of as being in S. 
The only difference between Example 2 and Example I is that in 
Example I the range of i is the ring R, whereas in Example 2 the range of i 
is the ring S. Thus if S is a bigger set than R, then the function of Example 
I is onto, while the function of Example 2 is not onto. 
These two examples illustrate a difference between functions in algebra 
and functions in beginning calculus. In beginning calculus, all the func-
tions have the same range, namely the real numbers (depicted geometri-
cally as the y-axis); in algebra there are many different rings and hence 
many different sets for functions to map into, so when we introduce a 
function it is important to specify both the domain and the range of the 
function as part of the definition of the function. 
B. Examples Involving 7L 
Here is a specjal case of Example 2: 
EXAMPLE 3. Let]: Z~iQ) by ](a) = a/I. Since (a/I)+(b/I)=(a+ 
b)/l, (a/I)· (b/l) = (ab)/I, and 1 = (1/1), ] is a ring homomorphism, 
which is I-I but not onto. 
Here is a function which is not 1-1: 
EXAMPLE 4. Let]: Z~Zn by lea) = [a]. Since [a]n + [b]n = [a + b]n' [a]n· 
[b]n = [ab ]n' and [l]n is the multiplicative identity of Zn'] is a homomor-
phism. (In fact, addition and multiplication were defined in Zn so as to 
make] a homomorphism!) One sees easily that] is onto but not 1-1. 
The next example arose in Chapter 11-10, when we defined the char-
acteristic of a field. 
EXAMPLE 5. Let F be a field, and let]: Z~ F be defined as follows: 
](0) = OF = O· IF; 
ifn>O,](n)=IF +IF +IF+··· +IF (ntimes), =n-lF; 
if n < 0, ]( n) = - ]( - n) = - ( - n)· 1 F = n· 1 F" 
This function is easily seen to be a homomorphism. 

258 
10 Isomorphisms, I 
In Chapter lI-lO we defined the characteristic of a field F to be 0 if this 
function f is 1-1; if f is not 1-1, then the smallest natural number p such 
thatf(p) = OF is the characteristic of F. We showed that if F is a field, then 
p must be prime. 
As an exercise in properties of homomorphisms, we prove: 
Proposition 1. Let F be a field, and f: 71.. ~ F the function of Example 5. If f 
is onto, then f cannot be 1-1; in fact, F has characteristic p for some prime p, 
and F has exactly p elements. 
PROOF. We first assume thatfis onto, and show f cannot be 1-1. Supposef 
were 1-1. By property (iv), f(O) = OF' the zero element of F, and by 
property (iii), f(1) = IF' the identity element of F. Let f(2) = IX. If f were 
I-I, IX =t= IF and IX =t= OF' Since F is a field, there is some fJ in F with 
IXfJ = IF' Sincefis onto, there is some integer n such thatf(n) = fJ. Then by 
property (ii), f(2n) = f(2)f( n) = IXfJ = IF = f( I). If f were I-I, 2n = 1. But 
that is impossible: there is no integer n such that 2n = 1. Thus f cannot be 
1-1. 
This means that F must have characteristic p for som~ prime p, by 
Chapter II -10. 
Now f is onto; it follows that all elements of F have the form OF' IF' 2· 
IF' ... , (p - I) . IF' For since F has characteristic p, OF = p' I F' Given 
any integer n, n = qp + r where 0" r <p; hence n' IF = qp' IF + r' IF = r 
. IF where 0" r <po So Fhasp elements. That completes the proof. 
0 
EXAMPLE 6. Extending the ideas of the proof of Proposition I gives an 
example of an isomorphism which will be useful in other chapters. 
Proposition 2. Let F be a field of characteristic p, a prime. Let Fo be the set 
of all integer multiples of IF in F, that is, the image of the function F of 
Example 5. Then Fo is isomorphic to 7l..p. 
PROOF. We defi~e a function j from 7l..p to Fo ~s follows: If n = qp + r, 
0" r <p, then f([n]p) = r' IF' We show that f is an isomorphism by 
showing that it is well defined, a homomorphism, 1-1, and onto. 
j is well defined because [n]p = [m]p iff nand m leave the same 
remainder when divided by p. 
To show that j is a homomorphism we must check properties (i)-(iii). 
(i) Given integers n" n2' let nl = qlP + rl, n2 = q2P + r2, with 0 " rl <p, 
o " r2 <po Then nl + n2 = (ql + Q2)P + rl + r2, and also = Q3P + r3 where 
0" r3 <po Thus r3 + sp = rl + r2 for some s ;;. O. So rl' IF + r2' IF = (rl + 
r2)' IF = r3' IF + sp· IF = r3· IF' _That mea.?s thatj([ndp + [n2]p) = ]([nl + 
n2]p) = r3' IF = rl· 1 F + r2' 1 F = f([nl]p) + f([n2]p)' which proves (i). 
(ii) is similar to (i) and is left as an exercise (EI2). 
(iii) ]([ I ]p) = I F by definition. 

C Examples Involving F[x] 
259 
As to f being 1-1, if j([ n ]p) = OF' then p divides n, so [n]p = 0 in 7l.p- So J 
is 1-1 by Exercise E2. 
Finally, J is onto as follows. Since F has characteristic p, Fo consists of

integer q. So m· IF = r· IF. Since 0 <. r <p, r· IF = J([r]p). So J is onto. 
That completes the proof of Proposition 2.

c. Examples Involving F[ x] 
From Chapter 7 we have the next example. 
EXAMPLE 7. Define f : F ~ F[ x]/ p( x) where F is any field and p( x) is a 
polynomial of degree > 1, by fer) = [r]p(x). This is easily seen to be a 
homomorphism, and we showed in Chapter 7 that f is 1-1. 
EXAMPLE 8. Let f: F[x]~F[x]/p(x) be defined by f(r(x» = [r(x)]p(x), 
where F,p(x) are as above. Thenfis an onto homomorphism. As with the 
homomorphism 7l. ~ 
7l.n of Example 4, this is a homomorphism because of 
the way we defined addition and multiplication in F[x]/p(x). 
EXAMPLE 9. We wish to extend Example 8, and consider homomorphisms 
from F[x], F a field, into other rings R. 
Proposition 3. If a function cp: F[ x] ~ R is a homomorphism, then the 
values of cp are completely determined by specifying cp(a) for all a in F, and 
cp(x). 
PROOF. A typical element of F[x] is a polynomial p(x), and since cp is a 
ring homomorphism we may write cp(p(x» as follows: 
cp(p(x)) = cp(ao + a\x + ... + anxn) 
= cp(ao) + </>(a\x) + </>(a2x2) + ... +cp(anx n) 
= </>(ao) + </>(a\)cp(x) + cp(a2)</>(x)2 + ... + </>(an)</>(xY· 
Thus cp(p(x» is described in terms of cp(a;), ai in F, and </>(x), as was to be 
shown. 
0 
A special case of this last situation is if F is a subset of Rand cp(a) = a 
for a in F. Then </> is completely determined by its value on x; in fact, 
</>(p(x» = p(</>(x». 

260 
10 Isomorphisms, I 
EXAMPLE 10. Let a be any element of F. We get a homomorphism 
cJ>a : F[x]~F by setting cJ>ir) = r for r in F and cJ>a(x) = a. This gives the 
"evaluation at a" map: if p(x) is any polynomial, cJ>ip(x» = pea). 
EXAMPLE 11. Suppose now we want to define a homomorphism f from 
F[xJ/p(x) to R, where F c: Rand f(a) = a for a in F. We may not let 
f([x]p(x» be just any element of R. In fact, if f([x]p(x» = b, then 0 = 
f([p(x)]p(x» = p(J[x]):;:: pCb), so b must be a root of p(x) in R. Conversely, 
if b is a root of p(x), then the function f: F[x]/p(x)~R given by 
f(q([x]p(x») = q(b) is well defined (that is, if [q\(x)]p(x) = [qlx)]p(x), then 
ql(b) = qlb» and is a ring homomorphism). To see thatfis well defined, 
suppose [q\(x)]p(x) = [qlx)]p(x)' Then q\(x) = q2(X) + k(x)p(x) for some 
polynomial k(x). So q\(b) = q2(b) + k(b)p(b). Since pCb) = 0, q\(b) = 
q2(b). 
We sum up the above as 
Proposition 4. Let F be a field, R a ring containing F, p(x) a polynomial in 
F[x]. The function f : F[x]/p(x)~R defined by f(a) = a for a in F,f([x]) = 
b is a well-defined homomorphism iff b is an element of R with p( b) = O. 
ExAMPLE 12. If we wish to define a homomorphismf from lR[x]/(x2 + 1) 
to C, we can do it by lettingf(r) = r for r in IR ~d lettingf([x]) = i or - i, 
one of the two roots of x 2 + 1 in C. We may not letf([x]) be anything else 
for, if f is a homomorphism, 0 = f([O]) = f([x2 + 1]) = f([x]f + 1, so f([X])2 
must be a root in C of x 2 + 1. 
Observe that the functionf: lR[x]/(x2 + l)~C given by fer) = r, f([x]) 
= i is an isomorphism of rings. We essentially already observed that. For 
in Chapter 7 we described lR[x]/(x2 + 1) as the set of el~ments of the form 
[a + bx] = [a] + [b][x], a, b real, where [xf = - 1. Then we "relabeled": 
[x] was called i, [a] became a, [b] became b. Having done that, lR[x]/(x2 + 
1) became indistinguishable from C. In fact what we were doing was 
implicitly describing the isomorphism 
f: IR[ x J/ (x 2 + 1) ~ C 
given by f([a + bx]) = a + bi. 
In general, the existence of an isomorphism between a ring R and a ring 
S implies that anything algebraic which we know about one ring we then 
know about the other. For example, in C we know there are five different 
fifth roots of 1. Let u\' u2' u3, u4, Us be the five fifth roots of 1 in C. Since 
f: lR[x]/(x2 + 1) ~ C is 1-1 and onto, there are five elements 
hI' h2' h3' h4' hs in lR[x]/(x2 + 1) such thatf(hj ) = Uj • Each hj is then a fifth 
root of 1 in lR[x]/(x2 + 1), for f(hi) = ui = 1 in C and sincef(l) = 1 andf 
is 1-1, 1 = hi in IR[ x ]/ (x2 + 1). As another example, in the proof of 
Proposition 1, we showed that if f is onto a field F, where f: l ~ F is as in 

D Automorphisms 
261 
Example 5, thenfcou1d not be 1-1: for iff were 1-1, thenfwould be an 
isomorphism, and so F would be isomorphic to 71.. Then, since F is a field, 
71. would have to be a field also, which it is not. 
D. Automorphisms 
One special kind of homomorphism is that of an isomorphism from a ring 
R onto itself. Such a function is called an automorphism of the ring R. 
One such example is Example 1, the function i: R-->;R defined by 
i(r) = r, called the identity automorphism. Here are two other examples. 
EXAMPLE 13. Letj : C-->;C be defined byj(r + si) = r - si for r, s real. The 
functionj is called complex conjugation; if a is a complex number,j(a) is 
usually denoted ii. Geometrically, j is the map which takes a complex 
number, viewed as a point in the plane, and sends it to its reflection across 
the real axis. 
a 
li 
EXAMPLE 14. Let F be a field of characteristic p. Then the map cf>p : F -->; F 
given by cf>p(a) = aP is a 1-1 ring homomorphism. If Fis a finite field, then 
cf>p is onto, and is therefore an automorphism of F. 
All of this is easily shown using Theorem 1 and the proof of Theorem 2 
of Chapter 11-10. 
E3. Verify the claims of Example 14. 
E4. Let F be the field of rational functions j / g with j, g in lp[x]. Show that 
cf>p : F ~ F is not sUIjective. 
The map cf>p has the following nice property. 
Proposition 5. Let F be a field of characteristic p, and let 71.p be the subset of 
F consisting of 0, 1, 1 + 1, ... , 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1, ... , where 0, 1 are

10 Isomorphisms, I 
respectively the zero and identity elements of F. Let <Pp : F ---+ F be as in 
Example 14. Then for a in F, <pia) = a iff a is in l.r 
PROOF. <pia) = a iff aP = a iff a is a root in F of the polynomial x P - x in 
F[x]. Now xP - x has at most p roots in the field F, but by Fermat's 
theorem each of the p elements of l.p is a root of x P - x. Thus aP = a iff a 
is in l.r 
We shall use this proposition subsequently in Chapter 15. 
If f, g are two automorphisms of a ring R, so is their composition fg, 
fg(r) = f(g(r». It is not hard to see that the set of all automorphisms of R 
is a group with respect to the operation of composition. The study of 
groups of automorphisms of fields is a beautiful theory, known as Galois 
theory after its inventor. Expositions of Galois theory may be found in 
numerous more advanced books in abstract algebra, such as Herstein 
(1964).

S-:=R. 
E9. Let F be a field and consider E(F), the set of functions from F to F. We can 
add and multiply in E(F) by (f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a), (f. g)(a) = 
(f(a))(g(a)). There is a function 0, O(a) = 0, and a function 1, I(a) = 1 for all 
a in F. Then E(F) is a commutative ring with unity. Consider the function

Finite Fields are Simple 
In Chapter 7 we constructed a collection of simple field extensions, that is, 
fields of the form K = F[x]/(p(x», by starting with a field F and an 
irreducible polynomi,al p( x) in F[ x], and letting K be the set of congruence 
classes of polynomials modulo p(x). We observed that we could also think 
of K as K = F[ ,8], polynomials with coefficients in F evaluated at ,8, where 
,8 = [x]p(x) is an "invented root" of p(x). 
If q(x) is an irreducible polynomial of degree d with coefficients in 7L.p' 
then 7L.p[x]/(q(x» is a field withpd elements. For there is a 1-1 correspon-
dence between elements of 7L.p[x]/(q(x» and polynomials with coefficients 
in 7L.p of degree ~ d - 1, and there are pd such polynomials (since there are 
d coefficients ao, aI' ... , ad-I and p choices for each). In this way we can 
construct many finite fields (i.e., fields with finitely many elements) as 
simple field extensions of 7L.p for some p. 
Are there finite fields which are not simple field extensions of 7L.p for 
somep? 
Surprisingly, the answer is no. 
Theorem. Any finite field is isomorphic to a simple field extension of 7L.p for 
some prime p. 
We shall prove this theorem in this chapter. 
The theorem says that given the finite field F, there is a prime p, a 
polynomial q(x) in 7L.p[x] with invented root ,8, and an isomorphism 
cp : 7L.A,8]~F. 
If the theorem is true, then, thinking of 7L.p as polynomials of degree 0 in 
7L.p[ ,8], CP(7L.p) is a subfield of F isomorphic to 7L.p. We begin the proof of the 
theorem by finding the prime p and the subfield of F isomorphic to 7L.p. 

II Finite Fields are Simple 
265 
Lemma 1. If F is a finite field, then F has characteristic p for some prime 
p > 0 and so contains a subfield isomorphic to 7Lp. 
PROOF. If I is the multiplicative identity of F, let m' I = I + I + ... + (m 
times) and consider the set {I, 2· I, 3· I, ... , m' I, ... }. Since F is finite 
this set has only a finite number of distinct elements of F in it. So for some 
m and n, m < n, m' I = n' 1. Subtracting m' I from both sides, (n - m)· 1 
= O. Thus F has characteristic p for some prime p (see Chapter II-IO). 
Define a functionf from 7Lp to F by f([n)) = n' I, n > 0 (d. Proposition 2, 
Chapter III-IO). Thenfis well defined and 1-1, for [n] = [m] iff n = m + rp 
iff n' I = m' I + rp' I iff n' I = m' I (since p' 1 = 0); also, f is easily seen 
to be a ring homomorphism. Thus the image of f, namely, {no lin = 
0, I, 2, ... ,p - I} in F, is isomorphic to 7Lp • That proves the lemma. 
D 
We can now proceed to the proof of the theorem. 
PROOF. Suppose F has n elements and has characteristic p. Then F has a 
primitive element (Chapter 1), that is, an element a such that every 
nonzero element of F is a power of a. 
By Fermat's theorem, a n - 1 = 1, so a is a root of the polynomial 
x n - 1 -
1, thought of as having coefficients in 7Lp (where we regard 7Lp as 
being a sub field of F via the map f : [n] ~ n' I of the lemma above). 
Therefore, the set of polynomials in 7Lp[x] with a as a root is nonempty. 
Let q(x) be the minimal polynomial over 7Lp of a. By Proposition 1, 
Chapter III-8, q(x) is irreducible in 7Lp[x], and so 7Lp[x]j(q(x) is a field. 
Consider the function 
cp : TLA x Jj (a(x)) ~ F 
defined by 
cp([f(x)J) = f(a). 
Then cp is a well-defined ring homomorphism since a is a root of q(x) (by 
Proposition 4 of Chapter 10). cp is onto because cp([O)) = 0, CP([xT)) = aT, and 
every nonzero element of F is a power of a. It remains only to show that cp 
is I-I. Since 7Lp[x]j(q(x» is a field, that follows from Exercise E14, 
Chapter 10, and completes the proof. 
D 
One important consequence of this theorem is that it shows that there 
are severe restrictions on the number n of elements in a finite field. 
Corollary. If F is a finite field then F has pd elements for some prime p and 
natural number d. Thus if n is not a power of a prime, there is no field with n 
elements. 
PROOF. If F is a finite field, F~7Lp[x]j(q(x» for some irreducible poly-
nomial q(x) of degree d for some d. Then 7Lp[x]j(q(x» haspd elements (as 
we observed in the second paragraph of this chapter), and so F does also.

subscripts form a Latin square. For example, if we let G be the set of

Latin squares are of interest in agricultural experiments (see Fisher

12 Latin Squares 
ExAMPLE 1. Suppose five strains of wheat are to be tested for yield on a 
rectangular field (= plot of ground). The yield depends not only on the 
strain of wheat but also on the fertility of the soil, which may vary around 
the field. Suppose, for example, that the north side of the field happens to 
be more fertile than the south side. Suppose the experimenters did not 
know how the fertility varied around the field, and planted the five strains 
of wheat (labeled 1-5) as follows. 
North

If the yield of strain I were higher than that of strain 5 the experimenters 
would not know whether the result was caused by the fertility of the soil or 
the difference in the strains. 
Fertility tends to be more uniform along strips parallel to the edges of 
the field, because of the mixing effect of plowing parallel to the edges. So 
in doing the wheat yield experiment, the problem is to plant the wheat in 
such a way that variations in fertility of the soil along strips parallel to the 
edges can be neglected. A nice way to do this is to plant the strains of 
wheat in a Latin square arrangement, like so:

Different cows have different milk yields, and the same cow's milk yield

square is a useful design.

Returning to Example 1, suppose in addition to testing five strains of 
wheat, five kinds of fertilizer are also to be tested. We would like to use a 
Latin square arrangement for the fertilizer in such a way that each kind of 
fertilizer is used with each strain of wheat. What is needed, therefore, are 
two orthogonal Latin squares, that is, two 5 x 5 Latin squares such that 
each ordered pair (r, s) of (wheat, fertilizer) occurs exactly once on a plot.

But if V is to be orthogonal to all of the other sql'ares, then the number 
a =1= I cannot coincide with the corresponding number in any other square. 
For example, a =1= 2, for otherwise the pair (2, 2) occurs twice in the pair of 
squares (V, I), once at the second entry of the top row, and once in the first 
entry of the second row, so V and I are not orthogonal. The same

argument prevents a from being 3 or 4 or 5; a =1= 1, since 1 already occurs 
in the first column of V. 
This leads to the following problem: Given m, how many pairwise 
orthogonal m X m Latin squares can be constructed? 
Here are two facts: 
Theorem. (1) There cannot be more than m - 1 pairwise orthogonal m X m 
Latin squares. 
(2) If there is a field with m elements then there are m - I pairwise 
orthogonal m X m Latin squares. 
We leave the proof of the first statement of the theorem for Exercise E8. 
PROOF OF (2). Suppose we have a field F with m elements. Let a be a 
primitive element. Then am-I = 1 and every nonzero element of F is a 
power of a. Consider the addition table for F set up as follows: 
+ 
a

a i + 1 + as 
a i +m - 1 + as 
Examining the entries of the table, we see that each element of F occurs 
once in each row and once in each column (Exercise E3). If we write the 
nonzero entries of the table as powers of a (possible because a is a 
primitive element of F) and then replace the elements of F by the numbers 
I to m, using the correspondence

This was Example 3 above. 
This construction gives m - I pairwise orthogonal Latin squares. For 
the pair of entries in Li and ~ at the (r, s)th position is (a i +r + as, aJ+ r + 
as). Suppose i =I=}. If the pair of entries at the (r, s)th position is equal to 
the pair of entries at the (p, q)th position, then the pairs 
(a i + r + as; aJ+ r + as) and (a i +p + a q, aJ+p + a q ) 
are the same, so 
and 
Then 
so 
Since i =I=}, we must have a r -
aP = 0, r = p, hence a q = as and q = s. 
Thus Li and LJ are orthogonal if i =I=}. That completes the proof.

We shall prove in the next chapter that if n is any number which is a 
power of a prime, n = pe, then there is a field with n elements. For such 
numbers n the theorem says that there are n - I pairwise orthogonal n X n 
Latin squares, but not n pairwise orthogonal n X n Latin squares. 
In the case that n is not a prime power, the question remains, how many 
pairwise orthogonal n X n Latin squares can there be? For many n this is 
unknown. The smallest nonprime power is n = 6, and that question wa~ the 
content of a famous problem of Euler, called the problem of 36 officers. It 
goes as follows. 36 officers are to be placed in review in a square, 6 rows 
deep with 6 men in each row. The officers come from 6 different regi-
ments, and each regiment is represented by 6 officers, each of different 
ranks. For reasons of protocol it is desired that each row and column is to 
have one officer from each regiment and one officer of each rank. Can this 
be done? 

272 
12 Latin Squares 
If it could be done, then one would have a pair of orthogonal 6 X 6 
Latin squares. Euler believed that it could not be done, but it was not 
proved impossible for well over 100 years, until a proof was finally 
achieved by M. G. Tarry in 1901. Thus the situation for nonprime powers 
is apparently much different than for prime powers. There are 4 pairwise 
orthogonal 5 X 5 Latin squares and 6 pairwise orthogonal 7 X 7 Latin 
squares, but no two 6 X 6 Latin squares are orthogonaL 
The construction of orthogonal Latin squares is due to R. C. Bose. See 
Mann (1949).

Irreducible Polynomials in Zp[ x] 13 
A. Factoring xpn - x 
In this chapter we show that there are irreducible polynomials of any 
degree over z.p, and get a formula for the number of monic irreducible 
polynomials of each degree. 
We begin with a theorem about the number of elements there can be in 
a finite field. We showed in Chapter 11 that if F is a field with n elements, 
then n has to be a power of a prime. Here is the converse. 
Theorem 1. Given any prime p and any n > 0 there is a field with exactly pn 
elements. 
PROOF. Consider f(x) = xpn - x in Z.p[x]. By the corollary of Chapter 8 
there is a splitting field K for f(x), that is, a field K such that in K[x],f(x) 
factors into a product of linear factors. 
Let F be the subset of K consisting of all roots of xpn - x in K. We shall 
show F is the desired field. 
Claim. F contains p n distinct elements of K. 
To prove this claim, recall (Chapter 11-10, Theorem 2) that the deriva-
tive f'(x) of a polynomial f(x) has the property that if f(x) and f'(x) are 
relatively prime iIi K[x], then f(x) has no multiple roots in K. Computing 
the derivative of xpn - x, we get (d/ dx)(xpn - x) = pnx pn- I -
1 = -
1. 
Thus xpn - x has no multiple roots. That means that when xpn - x factors 
in K[x] into a product of linear factors, they are pn distinct linear factors. 
So xpn - x has p n distinct roots in K, as claimed. 

274 
13 Irreducible Polynomials in Ip[xJ 
Claim. F is a field. 
For F is the set of elements a of K which satisfy apn = a. Thus, if a, b 
are in F, then: 
(i) so is a + b: (a + byn = apn + bpn = a + b (the first equality is by 
Example 14, Chapter 10); 
(ii) so is a' b: (abyn = aP"bpn = ab; 
(iii) so is - a: (- ayn = (_l)pna pn = - a « - Wn = - 1 by Fermat's 
theorem); 
(iv) so is a-I: (a-Iyn = (aP")-1 = a-I. 
Since 0 and 1 are in F, and addition and multiplication in F is the same as 
that in K, therefore F is a field. That completes the proof. 
D 
Corollary. There is an irreducible polynomial in :lp[x] of degree n for each n. 
PROOF. Let F be a field withpn elements. By the theorem of Chapter 11, F 
is isomorphic to :lp[xl/(q(x» for some irreducible polynomial q(x) in 
:lp[x]. Since F has pn elements, :lAxl/(q(x» must have pn elements, so 
q(x) must have degree n, and is the desired polynomial. 
D 
Observe that the irreducible polynomial q(x) is a divisor of xpn - x. For 
otherwise we could write 
1 = q(x)r(x) + (xpn - x)s(x) in :lAx]. 
(*) 
Let f3 be a root of q(x) in F. By Fermat's theorem, f3 is also a root of 
xpn - x. Setting x = f3 in (*) we would get 1 = O. Thus q(x) must divide 
xpn - x. 
This observation leads to 
Theorem 2. xpn - x is the product of all irreducible polynomials in :lp[ x] of 
degree d for all d dividing n. 
We prove this in two parts. 
Theorem 2(a). If q(x) is an irreducible polynomial of degree d and din, then 
q(x) divides xpn -
X. 
PROOF. Let F= :lp[xl/ q(x) = :lp[a], where a = [x]q(x)' Then q(x) is the 
minima] poiynomial over :lp of a. Now F is a field withpd elements. So by 
Fermat's theorem,

Since din, aP = aP = ( ... «aP y ) ... } = a, so a IS a root 0 x-x. 
By Proposition 1, Chapter III-8 (or by the observation just preceding the 
theorem), q(x) divides xpn - x. 
D 

B Counting Irreducible Polynomials 
275 
Theorem 2(b). If q(x) is an irreducible factor of x p" - x and has degree d, 
then din. 
PROOF. Suppose that q(x) is an irreducible factor of x p" - x. Consider 
1':p[x]/(q(x» = K. If q(x) has degree d, K has pd elements. Let F be a field 
withpn elements. Since q(x) divides x p" - x and x p" - x haspn roots in F, 
there is a root f3 of q(x) in F. Thus there IS a homomorphism cp (Chapter 
10, Proposition 4) from K to F which is 1-1 by Chapter 10, Exercise EI4. 
Let K' be the image of K in F; K' is then a subfield of F isomorphic to K. 
Let a be a primitive element of F. We now copy the proof of the 
theorem of Chapter 11. Let sex) be the minimal polynomial of a over K'. 
Then sending [x] to a defines a homomorphism cp' from K'[x]/ sex) to F 
(Chapter 10, Proposition 4) which is 1-1 since sex) is irreducible, and onto 
since every nonzero element of F is a power of a. So cp' is an isomorphism 
from K'[x]/(s(x» onto F. So K'(x]/(s(x» and Fhave the same number of 
elements. 
How many elements are in K'[x]/(s(x»? If sex) has degree e, and Khas 
m elements, then K'[x]/(s(x» has me elements. But m = pd. Now F has pn 
elements. So (pdt = pn. So de = nand d, the degree of q(x), divides n. 
That completes the proof.

of X4 - x? 
B. Counting Irreducible Polynomials 
Let Nt be the number of irreducible polynomials of degree n in 1':p[x]. 
Using Theorem 2 we will find an explicit formula for N:. 
To obtain such a formula, we use the Mobius function, a classical tool 
in number theory which has attracted new interest in combinatorics in 
recent years (see Bender and Goldman (1975). 
Definition. The Mobius function /L(n) is defined for n > 1 by 
/L(n) = {6 
(-1)' 
if n = 1, 
ifpel n for some primep and some e > 1, 
if n is the product of r distinct primes. 

276 
13 Irreducible Polynomials in Zp[X] 
The formula we want is 
N: = 1. L /L(!!")pd. 
n din 
d 
(1) 
Formula (1) is a special case of the Mobius inversion formula, which we 
now derive. We begin with two facts about the Mobius function. 
Proposition 1. If (m, n) = 1, then /L(mn) = /L(m)/L(n). 
This is easy to verify. 
Such a function is called multiplicative. Another example of a multi-
plicative function is Euler's 4> function. 
Proposition 2. '2,dln/L(d) = 0 unless n = 1. 
The proof of this is an exercise in manipulating sums. Before doing the 
proof in general we illustrate with n = 36 = 2232: 
~ /L(d) = [/L(1) + /L(2) + /L(22) ] + [/L(3) + /L(2· 3) + /L(22. 3) ] 
dl36 
Now /L(d) = 0 if d is divisible by the square of a prime, so this sum reduces 
to 
[ /L(1) + /L(2)] + [ /L(3) + /L(2 . 3)] 
= [/L(1) + /L(2)] + [/L(1)/L(3) + /L(2)/L(3)] 
= [ /L(1) + /L(2)] + [ /L(1) + /L(2)] /L(3) 
= [ /L(l) + p,(2)] [ /L(1) + /L(3) J. 
(by Proposition 1) 
Now /L(1) = 1, /L(3) = - 1, so /L(1) + /L(3) = O. Hence '2, dI36/L( d) = O. 
The proof in general works in exactly the same way; instead of writing 
it all out, however, we have to use summation notation. 
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 2. Write n = pi' ... P:', el , •.• , er > 1. Then any 
d dividing n has the form

With these generalities out of the way, we can get formula (I) for Nt, 
the number of irreducible polynomials of degree n in Zp[xl We shall write 
Nt as Nn if p is understood. 
Theorem 2 describes the complete factorization of x p" - x in Zp for any 
n. Theorem 2 readily gives the formula 
since x p " - x, a polynomial of degree pn, has as factors Nd irreducible 
polynomials of degree d for each d dividing n. Applying the Mobius 
inversion formula with F(n) = pn, f(d) = dNd , we get 
or our desired formula: 
We can derive from the formula the corollary to Theorem 1, namely, 
that Nn > 0 for all n. Indeed, since Il(n/n) = 1, we have that Nn >

infinitely many different irreducible polynomials of degree n in Q[x]. So 
there are many irreducible polynomials in Q[x]!

Finite Fields 
In the last chapter we showed that there are, for example, 588 irreducible 
monic polynomials of degree 4 in Z7[X). Thus it is conceivable that there 
could be 588 different fields with 74 - 2401 elements. But that is not really 
the case. For in Exercise E7 of Chapter 10 you showed, for example, that 
the two different irreducible polynomials of degree 3 in Z2[X) gave simple 
field extensions which are isomorphic to each other, and you showed in 
Exercises EI and E2 of Chapter 11 that the same is true for certain fields 
with 9 or 16 elements. 
The remarkable fact is that if F) and F2 are any two fields with pn 
elements, then F) and F2 are isomorphic. Thus, rather than 588 different 
fields of 74 elements, there is, up to isomorphism, only one, which can be 
presented as a simple field extension of 27 in 588 different ways. 
The following theorem was proved by E. H. Moore in 1903. 
Theorem. Any two lieltis with p n elements are isomorphic. 
PROOF. We prove this theorem by showing that any field withpn elements 
is isomorphic to the field F consisting of all roots of xP• - x which we 
constructed in Theorem 1 of Chapter 13. 
We know that if F) is any field with pn elements, then F) is isomorphic 
to Zp[x]/(q(x» for q(x) some irreducible polynomial in Zp[x) of degree n, 
by the theorem of Chapter 11. So we choose any such irreducible poly-
nomial q(x) and show that ~[x]/(q(x» is isomorphic to F. 
We know that q(x) divides xP • -
x by Theorem 2 of Chapter 13. Since 
xP• - x has pn different roots in F, q(x) has a root in F; call it {3. We 
define a homomorphism cp from Zp[x]/(q(x» to Fby cp(f(x» - f({3). Since 
q({3) - 0, cp is well defined (Proposition 4, Chapter 10). Since Zp[x]/(q(x» 

14 Finite Fields 
281 
is a field, <p is 1-,1 by Exercise E14 of Chapter 10. Since both Zp[x]/(q(x» 
and F have p n elements and <p is 1-1, <p must be onto as well, so <p is an 
isomorphism. 
Since two fields which are isomorphic to F must be isomorphic to each 
other (Exercise £13 of Chapter 10), the proof is complete.

Since there is essentially only one field withpn elements, it is customary 
to give it a special name, namely GF(pn). GF stands for Galois field, after 
Galois, who first developed the theory of finite fields.

field with p n elements. 
PROOF. For if q(x) is the polynomial, and F2 is the field, then F2:::::::.

El. If d divides n, prove that any polynomial of degree din Zp[x] has a root in any 
field F with p n elements. 
The theorem of this chapter completes a development which is quite 
remarkable. We have, starting from nothing, given a complete description 
of all finite fields, up to isomorphism. For a mathematician who does 
"algebra" this is a very satisfying outcome. To ask analogous questions, 
such as, "Describe all commutative rings with unity, up to isomorphism," 
or, "Describe all finite groups, up to isomorphism" is to raise unsolved 
questions which have motivated the mathematical research of hundreds of 
mathematicians over the past several generations. 
E2. Show that if q(x) in .lAx] has degree d and F is a field withpn elements, where

The Discriminant and 
Stickelberger's Theorem 
In this chapter we describe a technique for deciding whether a given 
polynomial in Zp[x], p an odd prime, has an odd or an even number of 
distinct irreducible factors. The theorem is this: 
Stickelberger's Theorem. Let p be an odd prime, f a monic polynomial of 
degree d with coefficients in Zp[x], without repeated roots in any splitting 
field. Let r be the number of irreducible factors of f in Zp[x]. Then r =.d 
(mod 2) iff the discriminant D(f) is a square in Zp' 
Of course you do not know yet what the discriminant D(f) is. The rest 
of this chapter is devoted to explaining what D(f) is and how to compute 
it, and then to proving Stickelberger's theorem. 
The condition in the theorem that f have no repeated roots in any 
splitting field is one that can be checked by finding the greatest common 
divisor of f(x) and 1'(x). The greatest common divisor of l' and f is a 
constant iff f has no repeated roots, by Theorem 2, Chapter II -10. We shall 
see in fact that the discriminant D(f) is also computed by finding the 
greatest common divisor of f(x) and1'(x). 
A. The Discriminant 
The discriminant is defined in terms of something called the resultant. Let 
f, g be two polynomials with coefficients in a field F. Suppose K is a 
splitting field for fg, so that in K[x], 
f(x) = a(x - £x\)(x - £X2) ••• (x -
£xn), 
and g(x) = b(x - !3\)(x - (32) ... (x - 13m) 

A The Discriminant 
283 
for some aI' ... , an' f31' ... , f3m in K. We define the resultant of f and g, 
R(j, g), by 
n 
m 
R(f, g) = amb n II II (a; - f3J 
(n = degf, m = deg g). 
i=\ j=\ 
That is, R(j, g) = amb n times the product of all possible differences of the 
form (root of f - root of g). 
. 
Here are some facts about the resultant: 
Fact t. R(g,j) = (-I)mnR(j, g). 
PROOF. For obtaining R(g, j) from R(j, g) involves making mn changes of 
sign: (root of g - root of j) = - (root of f - root of g). 
D 
Fact 2. R(j, g) = 0 iff and g have any common factors. 
PROOF. For then in K, f and g would have a common root, so R(j, g) 
would have a factor of O. 
D 
Fact 3. R(j, g) = a deggII7= I g( aJ, where a is the leading coefficient off and 
a; are the various roots off. 
PROOF. Since g(x) = bIIJ=I(x - (3), g(aJ = bIIJ=I(a; - f3) and II7=lg(a;) = 
b nII7=IIIJ=I(a; - (3). Multiplying both sides by am gives the result. 
D 
Fact 4. If g = fq + r, then R(j, g) = a(degg-degr)R(j, r) where a is the 
leading coefficient off. 
PROOF. By Fact 3, R(j, g) = adeggII7=1 g(aJ = adeggII7=1[J(aJq(aJ + 
r( aJ]. Since the a; are roots of f, we get R(j, g) = adeggII7= Ir( aJ On the 
other hand, R(j, r) = adegrII7=lr(aJ, also by Fact 3. That gives Fact 4 
immediately. 
D 
Fact 5. R(j, b) = bdegj if b is a scalar. 
PROOF. This follows directly from Fact 3 with g(x) = b. 
D 
Facts 1, 4, and 5 permit the computation of the resultant of any two 
polynomials by Euclid's algorithm. It is then easy to show that the 
resultant R(j, g) is an element of the field F, even though it is defined in 
terms of elements of the bigger field K. 
El. Prove that R(j, g) is in F by induction on the number of steps in Euclid's 
algorithm for f and g. 
The discriminant of f is D(j) = (- ly(n-I)/2R(j, 1'), where l' is the 
derivative of f and n = degree of f. 
By Fact 2, D(j) =1= 0 iff f and l' have no common factors. 

284 
15 The Discriminant and Stickelberger's Theorem 
We compute D(!) by using Euclid's algorithm on f and f'. Here are 
some examples. 
EXAMPLE 1. Let f(x) = x-a. Then 1'(x) = 1, so D(i) = (_1)(100)/2R(j, 1) 
= R(j, 1) = ldegj = 1, by 5. 
ExAMPLE 2. Let f(x) = x2 + ax + b. Then D(i) = - R(j,1'). Now f'(x) = 
2x + a, and 
x2 + ax + b = (2x+a)(I+*) + (b- ~). 
Call b - (a2/4) = r. Then 
D(j) = (-li(I)/2 R(j,f') = (- I)R(j,j') 
= -R(j',f) 
(by Fact 1) 
= 2degj-degr( -1)(R(j', r) 
(where r = b - (a2/4), by Fact 4) 
= -2(2-0)R(j',b-(a2/4)) 
= a2 - 4b. 
Note that the roots of fare 
a 
1 "\ I 
2 
- '2 ± '2 va -4b . 
So f has two irreducible factors iff a2 - 4b = D(i) is a square in F. 
Stickelberger's theorem is true in this case over any field F. 
EXAMPLE 3. Let f(x) = x 3 + qx + r. Then 1'(x) = 3x2 + q and, doing 
Euclid's algorithm, 
x 3 + qx + r = (3x2 + q)( ~) + (%qX + r), 
3x2 + q = (2r + r)( ~; _ ~:~) + ( q + ~7;: ). 
Then D(i), using these calculations, is -4q3 - 27r2. 
Now that we know what the discriminant is, Stickelberger's theorem makes 
sense. We try it out on a few cubic polynomials of the form in Example 3, 
with F= 7L.5•

ExAMPLE 4. Letp, q be distinct odd primes, and letf(x) = x q - 1 in lp[x). 
We need a splitting field K for x q -
1. Let K be a field containing lp with 
pn elements so that q divides pn - 1 (for example, let n be the order of p 
mod q). If /3 is a primitive element of K, /3(p"-I)/q = a will satisfy a q = 1, 
with a + 1. Moreover, q will be the order of a in K (since /3(p"-I)/q = a 
and /3 has order pn - 1 in K), so 1, a, a2, a3,' •• aq- I are distinct 
elements of K. Since they are roots in K of x q -
1, they are all the roots of 
x q -
1. Thus K is a splitting field for x q -
1. 
Then we may compute D(x q -
1) by using Fact 3 of resultants: 
q 
D(xq - 1) = (_1)(q-I)/2 IT q(ai)q-I. 
i=i 
Collecting terms, this becomes 
(_I)(q-I)/2qq(1 ·a·a2 . .. aq-I)q-I = (_I)(q-I)/2qq(a q(q-I)/2)q-1 
= (-liq- I)/2qq 
in lp since a q = I, and q is odd. 
For a special case, suppose q = 11, p = 7. Then in 17[x), 
D(x ll - 1) = (_1)(11-1)/211 11 
(in 17) 
=: -11 11 
=5 
which is not a square in 17' Applying Stickelberger's theorem, if r = 
number of irreducible factors of x II - 1 in 17' 
r = 11 (mod 2) iff 5 = D(xll -
I) is a square. 
Hence r i5 II (mod 2) so r is even: XII - I has an even number of factors 
in 17[x). 
To find the actual factorization of XII - 1 in 17[x) would be harder. 
We shall use Example 4 in the next chapter. 
To prove Stickelberger's theorem we shall need the following two facts 
about the discriminant.

B. Roots of Irreducible Polynomials in lp[ x] 
Let K be a field of characteristic p, and let Zp be the subfield {n· lin = 
I, ... ,p} of K. Let <Pp : K ~ K be the automorphism given by <pia) = aP. 
Then, as we observed in Chapter 10, <Pp gives a means to check whether an 
element of K is actually in ZP' namely, a is in Zp iff <pia) = aP = a. The 
reason for this being true is that if aP = a, then a is a root in K of the 
polynomial xP - X. But the p elements of Zp are all roots of xP - x, by 
Fermat's theorem, and xP - x cannot have more than p roots in the field 
K. So if aP = a, then a must be in Zp-
We extend <Pp to a function from K[x] to itself by defining <pp(x) = x; 
hence 
<pi anxn + an_IXn- 1 + ... + alx + ao) = a%xn + a%_lxn- 1 + ... + aG· 
Then we have easily 
Proposition 3. <Pp(f(x» = f(x) iff f(x) is in Zp[x]. 
Suppose now that f(x) is in Zp[x] and f(x) = (x - al) ... (x - a".) in 
K[x]. Since f(x) is in ZAx], <Pp(f(x» = f(x). So 
f(x) = <pp(j(x» = (x - af) ... (x - a::,). 
By uniqueness of factorization of polynomials in K[x], the set of roots 
{af, ... , a::'} is the same as the set {aI' ... , a".}. Thus we have 
Corollary. The p th power of any root of a polynomial f(x) in Zp[x] is a root of 
f(x). 
For irreducible polynomials in Zp[x] it turns out that once you have one 
root in K you have them all: 
Proposition 4. If f(x) in Zp[x] is irreducible of degree d, K is a field 
containing ZP' and a in K is a root of f(x), then in K[x], f(x) = (x - a)(x -
aP)(x - aP) ... (x - apd-'). 
We have already noted this fact whenp = 2 in connection with roots of 
irreducible polynomials used in error-correcting codes. 
PROOF. Certainly a, aP, aP2, ... are all roots of f(x) by the last corollary. 
Suppose r is the smallest natural number such that apr = a. Then 
a, aP, aP2, ... ,aP'-' are all distinct (otherwise apk = aph for some h, k, I

degree of f, namely d. 

288 
15 The Discriminant and Stickelberger's Theorem 
Let g(x) = (x - a)(x - aP) ... (x - aP'-'). Since (aP'-'y = a, <l>ig(x» 
= g(x), so g(x) is in .lp[x]. Evidently a is a root of g(x). Now f(x) is 
irreducible and has a as a root, so f(x) must divide g(x). But since the 
degree of g(x) is " the degree of f(x), f(x) = g(x). That, plus Exercise E5, 
completes the proof.

E5. How do you know in this last proof that there exists a number r such that 
a P' = a? 
From Proposition 4 we get a new proof of a corollary which we know 
already from Chapter II -10. 
Corollary. An irreducible polynomial f(x) in Zp[x] has no multiple roots in 
any extension field. 
PROOF. We just showed that if f(x) has degree d and a is a root in some 
field K containing .lp' then 
f(x) = (x - a) (x - aP) ... (x - apd- I ) 
and all those roots a, aP, ... , apd- I are distinct.

c. Stickelberger's Theorem 
Weare now ready to prove 
Theorem. Let p be an odd prime, f(x) a monic polynomial of degree m with 
coefficients in .lp[x] without multiple factors (so that its discriminant D(f) =F 
0). Let r be the number of irreducible factors of f(x) in .lp[x]. Then r =m 
(mod 2) iff D(f) is a square in Zp-
PROOF. We prove it first for r = 1. The result for general r will follow 
easily, as we shall see. 
Case r = 1. We assume f(x) is irreducible of degree m. Let K be a field 
containing Zp in which f(x) splits into linear factors. Let a be a root of f. 
Then the roots off(x) are a, aP , a P2, ••• , a pm - I by Proposition 4 of the last 
section. 
Let 13(f) = IIj=-IIII1:6(api - apj) in K. Then D(f) = (13(f)2, in K, so 
D(f) is a square in .lp iff 13(f) is in .lp. 
We test to see whether 13(f) is in .lp by examining <l>p(13(f): 
<I>/13(f)) =

(mod 2). Since we have assumed r = I, the theorem is true for r = 1. 
Suppose now 1 = 11 12 . . . j,., a product of r distinct irreducible factors. 
Then by Proposition 2, above, 
D(J) = D(Jd2· .. j,.) = D(JI)D(J2) ... D(j,.)R2 
for some R in lp. Thus in K, 
8(J) = 8(JI)8(J2) ... 8(j,.)R 
where R is in lp- To see whether 8(f) is in lp we apply <pp. By the case 
r = I, <pp8(./;) = (-1)~-18(./;), where d; = deg./;. So 
<pp8(J) = 8(JI)8(J2) ... 8(j,.)R· (_I)d,-I( _1)d2-1 ••• (_I)dr-1

Now dl + d2 + ... + dr = m, the degree of l(x). Thus D(f) is a square in 
lp iff 8(f) is in lp iff (-I)d,+ ... +d,-r = 1 iff (_l)m-r = 1 iff m =r 
(mod 2), which was what we wanted to prove. 
To apply Stickelberger's theorem we need to be able to decide whether 
D(f) is a square mod p. We shall find a nice way to determine this when 
we do quadratic reciprocity. It willl\.lso turn out that the law of quadratic 
reciprocity will be a consequence of Stickelberger's theorem.

Quadratic Residues 16 
A. Reduction to the Odd Prime Case 
In Chapter 1-6 we mentioned that the question of when it is possible to 
solve X2 ==a (mod m) was one that involved a certain amount of nontrivial 
mathematics. In this chapter we describe a procedure for determining 
efficiently whether or not a is a square mod m. The main result, known as 
the law of quadratic reciprocity, was first proved by Gauss and is a 
cornerstone of number theory. 
We begin this chapter with results which show that to decide whether a 
number a is a square mod m for any m, it suffices to be able to decide 
whether a is a square mod p when p is an odd prime. 
Theorem 1. Let m = pf'Pf2 ••• P:'. Then the number a is a square mod m iff 
there are numbers XI' .•• ,x, such that 
Xf == a (modpft), 
x~ == a (modpf2), 
PROOF. If xf ==a (modpft), ... ,x;=a (modp:'), then by the Chinese 
remainder theorem there is some Xo satisfying XO==XI (modpft), ... ,Xo 
== X, (mod P:'). Such an Xo satisfies x~ == a (mod m). Conversely, if x~ = a 
(mod m), then certainly x~=a (modp{i) for each i = 1, ... , r. 
D 

292 
16 Quadratic Residues 
Thus to decide whether a number a is a square mod m, it suffices to 
decide it mod powers of primes dividing m. To do that we must consider 
separately p odd, and p = 2. 
Theorem 2. Let p be an odd prime, and (a, p) = 1. Then there i$ a solution of 
x2=a (modpe), e > 1, iff there is a solution of x2=a (modp). 
PROOF. If xJ = 
a (mod p e), then xJ = 
a (mod p). Conversely, suppose a is 
a square modp. Let b be a primitive element modpe: b exists by Proposi-
tion 2 of Chapter III-2. Then b r =a (modpe) for some r. We must show 
that r is even. If b r =a (modpe), then b r =a (modp). Since b is also a 
primitive element mod p, by Exercise E6 of Chapter III-2, and a is a 
square modp, there exists s such that b2s =a (modp), so b r =b2s 
(modp). But this implies that r=2s (modp-l) by Exercise E6 of 
Chapter III-I. Since p is odd, r must be even, so r = 2t for some number t. 
But then b r = (bti =a (modpe) and a is a square modpe. 
D 
Theorem 3. Suppose a is odd. Then 
(a) a is always a square mod 2, 
(b) a is a square mod 4 iff a = 1 (mod 4), 
(c) a is a square mod 2e, e > 3, iff a = 1 (mod 8). 
PROOF. (a) and (b) are easy. For (c), suppose first that b2 =a (mod 2e ), 
e > 3. Then b2 = a (mod 8), so a must be = 1 (mod 8) by an easy com-
putation. 
Conversely, suppose a = 1 + 8n for some fixed integer n. We show that 
for any e there is some Xe with 
by induction on e. 
For e = 3, 2e = 8, let X3 = 1. Then x~ == 1 + 8n (mod 8), and the case 
e = 3 is solved. Write x~ = 1 + 8n + 23u3 for some integer U3 (here of course 
U3 = - n). 
Assume e > 3 and x:- 1 = 1 + 8n + 2e - 1ue _ 1 for some integer ue- 1• Then 
Xe- 1 is odd. Let Xe = Xe- 1 + 2e- 2ue_ 1• Then since 2(e - 2) > e, 
Since Xe - 1 is odd, x: = 1 + 8n (mod 2e). Thus for any e > 3 we can solve 
X2 == 1 + 8n (mod 2e ) by induction on e.

El. What happens in Theorems 2 and 3 if a is not relatively prime to p? 

B The Legendre Symbol 
293 
B. The Legendre Symbol 
From Theorems 2 and 3 the only case where we have to find criteria to 
decide when x 2 =a (mod m) is solvable is when m = p, an odd prime. 
Say that a is a quadratic residue (mod p) if x 2 = 
a (mod p) has a 
solution; otherwise a is a quadratic nonresidue (modp). 
To formulate the criteria, we introduce the Legendre symbol. 
Definition. Let p be an odd prime, and a any number not divisible by p. 
Then the Legendre symbol (~) is defined by 
if a is a quadratic residue mod p 
if a is a quadratic nonresidue modp. 
To decide whether a is a quadratic residue mod p, we manipulate 
Legendre symbols. Here are the rules. 
Theorem 4. Assume a and bare integers,p is an oddprime, and (p, ab) = 1. 
Then 
(1) ( ;2) = 1, 
(2) ifa=b (modp), (~)=(*), 
(4) ( ~ 1 ) = ( _1)(p-l)/2, 
(6) (~)( *) = (_I)[(p-l)/2][(q-l)/2] if p and q are both odd primes. 
Of these, (6) is the law of quadratic reciprocity. It says, for example, that 
if either p or q is = 1 (mod 4), then p is a square mod q iff q is a square 
modp. 

294 
16 Quadratic Residues 
EXAMPLE. Is -42 a square mod 97? We ask, is ( -:'2) = 1 or -I? Using 
the rules of Theorem 4, we manipulate as follows: 
( ~~2) = ( ;71 )( ;7 )( :7 )( ;7 ) 
(by rule (3» 
= (:7 )( ;7 ) (by rules (4) and (5» 
= (9;)( 9;) 
(by rule (6» 
= (j)( ~ ) 
(by rule (2» 
= (~) 
(by rule (1» 
= (~)( ~) = (~) 
(by rules (3) and (5» 
= (-1)( ~) = (-1)( j) = -1 
(by rules (6), (2) and (1». 
Thus -42 is not a square mod 97. 
It is apparent that the law of quadratic reciprocity, rule (6), is the rule 
which gives the most striking results. It permits one to decide whether 3 is 
a square mod 97 by seeing whether 97 is a square mod 3. The former 
question is not so easy to decide, but the latter is very easy.

The rest of this chapter is devoted to proofs of the various properties of 
the Legendre symbol collected as Theorem 4. The proofs range from trivial 
to very clever. 
PROOF OF THEOREM 4, RULE (l). Trivial.

PROOF OF RULE (2). (;) = 1 iff there is some c with c2 =. a (mod p) iff 
there is some c with c2 =. b (mod p )(since a =. b (mod p» ift( * )

PROOF OF RULE (3). Let e be a primitive element modp. Then a =.e', 
b =.e S for some r, s, so ab =e'+s. Now e l is a square modp iff t is even. 

B The Legendre Symbol 
295 
Thus ( ~ ) = 1 iff r + s is even iff rand s are both even or both odd iff ( ~ ) 
and ( ~ ) are both + 1 or both - 1 iff ( * )( ~ ) = 1.

PROOF OF RULE (4). This is the theorem of Chapter 1II-3. We proved there 
that -1 is a square modp iffp = 1 (mod 4) iff (p - 1)/2 is even.

To prove Rules (5) and (6) we need the following generalization of 
Rule (4). 
Euler's Lemma. If p is an odd prime and (a,p) = 1, then U) =a(p-l)/2 
(modp). 
PROOF. Let b be a primitive element modp, and let b r =a (modp). Then 
a(p-l)/2=b r(p-l)/2=c, where, since c2=b(p-l)r=1'=1 (modp), c=l 
or c= -1 (modp). Now a(p-l)/2= 1 (modp) iff b r(p-l)/2= 1 (modp) 
iff p - 1 divides rep - 1)/2 iff r is even iff a is a square mod p iff (~) = 1. 
In case r is odd, both U) and a(p-l)/2 must be congruent to -1 modp. 
That completes the proof of Euler's lemma. 
0 
Note. Euler's lemma also follows from Berlekamp's algorithm, Chapter 
11-12, E13. 
E9. In both (3) and Euler's lemma we used the fact that if e is a primitive element 
mod p and er == a (mod p). then a is a quadratic residue mod p iff r is even.

PROOF OF RULE (5). Using Euler's lemma we need to show that

We break up the right-hand side. 
Case 1. p = I or 5 (mod 8). Then (p - 1)/4 is an integer. So the right-

Case 2. p == 3 or 7 (mod 8). Then (p - 3)/4 is an integer. Then the same

That completes the proof of (5).

c. Proof of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity 
o 
We are left with (6), the law of quadratic reciprocity. There are reputedly 
over 150 different proofs of this result. Gauss, in his Disquisitiones 
Arithmeticae (Gauss, 1801), gave the first three. The proof we give is an 
adaptation by E. R. Berlekamp of a proof of R. G. Swan (see Berlekamp 
(1968) and Swan (1962». It uses Stickelberger's theorem. We have chosen 
this proof because it integrates both themes of this book, the theory of 
polynomials and number theory. A nice proof which does not require the 
prerequisites of the proof we give is Gauss's third proof as polished by 
Eisenstein. It may be found in the elementary number theory texts of 
Dickson (1929) or McCoy (1965). 
PROOF OF RULE (6). (6) involves a relationship between squares in lp and 
squares in 7L.q. To get such a relationship we establish a connection 
between r, the number of irreducible factors of x P -
I in 7L.q[x], and e, the 
order of q mod p. This will imply a connection between p being a square 
mod q and q being a square mod p, with the aid of Stickelberger's theorem. 
We first prove 
(i) If f(x) is any irreducible factor of (xP - l)/(x - 1) in lq[x], then the 
degree of f(x) is e, the order of q mod p. 
PROOF OF (i). Let K be a splitting field of x P - lover lq. Let a be a root in 
K of f(x). By Proposition 4, Chapter 15, 
f(x) = (x - a) (x - aq)(x - a<T) ... (x - a qn-'), 
where n is the smallest natural number with a qn = a. We shall show that 
n=e. 

C Proof of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity 
297 
First note that since a is a root -:F 1 of x P -
1, the order of a in K is > 1 
and divides p (a prime), so is exactly p. Thus if a' = 1 for any r, then p 
divides r. 
Let n be the smallest natural number with a qn = a. Then n is the 
smallest natural number so that a qn - I = 1, so n is the smallest natural 
number with p dividing qn - 1. Thus n is the smallest number with qn = I 
(modp). But that means n = e. 
D 
(ii) The number r of irreducible factors of x P - 1 is r = 1 + (p - 1)/ e. 
PROOF OF (ii). The degree of (x P - l)/(x - 1) is degree p - 1, and each 
irreducible factor of (xP - I)/(x - I) has degree e, by (i). So there are 
(p - 1)/ e irreducible factors of (x P -
1)/(x - 1) and thus, r = 1 + (p -
I)/e. 
D 
We apply Stickelberger's theorem to x P -
I in lq[x]. It asserts that if 
r is the number of irreducible factors of xP - I, 
d is the degree of x P -
1, 
D is the discriminant of x P - I, 
then r -=d (mod 2) iff D is a square (mod q). 
Now 
d=p, 
r = I + (p - 1)/ e where e is the order of q mod p, by (ii), and 
D = (-lip-I)/]JP by Example 4, Chapter 15. 
Thus Stickelberger's theorem reads: 
P-I 
/ 
I + -- -= p (mod 2) iff ( - I)(P -I) 2pp 
is a square mod q. 
e 
Since p is odd, this yields:

q(P-l)/2 = 1 (modp) iff (:) = 1. 
Thus from Stickelberger's theorem we get 
(:) = 1 iff (_I)(P;I)/2pP ) = 1,

Duplicate Bridge Tournaments 17 
In this chapter we describe a connection between quadratic residues and 
design of duplicate bridge tournaments. 
The connection involves a way of constructing certain square matrices 
called Hadamard matrices. We begin by looking at them. 
A. Hadamard Matrices 
A Hadamard matrix is an n X n matrix 8 with all entries + I or -I, and 
with 8.81 = nl. Here 81 denotes the transpose of 8, and I is the identity 
matrix. 
Here are some examples. 
EXAMPLE: n = I. 
(I). 
EXAMPLE: n = 2. 
( 
~ -I) 
I . 
EXAMPLE: n = 4. Define a 4 x 4 matrix 8 by the following rules. The rows 
and columns of 8 will be labeled 00, I, 2, 3; S(i,}) denotes the entry in the 
ith row,jth column. Then 
S(i,j) = {-: 
L(i - j) 
if j=oo 
if j of:: 00, i = 00 
otherwise. 
(the leftmost column) 
(the rest of the top row)

17 Duplicate Bridge Tournaments 
Here L(i - ) equals 1 (respectively -1) if i - ) is (respectively is not) a 
square mod 3. When i - ) ::j= 0, L(i - ) is the usual Legendre symbol 
( i;)). 
When i -) = 0, then since 0 = 0 2, L(O) = 1. 
Thus the matrix S is

The rows of S are pairwise orthogonal, that is, S ost = 41, as is quickly 
checked. So are the columns of S, since Sost = S'oS. So S is a Hadamard 
matrix. 
The idea of using the extended Legendre symbol L( i - ) to construct 
Hadamard matrices can be extended from the 4 x 4 case to the n X n case 
whenever 41n and n - 1 is prime. We first illustrate with n = 8. 
EXAMPLE: n = 8. Number the rows and columns of an 8 x 8 matrix by 00, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Form the matrix S = (S(i,)) by defining S(i,) as 
follows: 
S(i,oo)=1 
S(oo,)) = -1 
S(i,)) = L(i - )) 
for all i; 
for all)::j= 00; 
for i,)::j= 00, 
where L(i - ]) = 1 (respectively -1) if i - ) is (respectively is not) a square 
mod 7. Again, if i::j=), then 
L(i -)) = C 
~ i), 
the usual Legendre symbol, and L(O) = 1. Then S = (S(i,]) is the matrix

This is a Hadamard matrix: S· S' = 81 (as is easily verified). 

A Hadamard Matrices 
301 
Here is the general example of this type. We assume 41n and n - 1 is a 
prime p. Since p == 3 (mod 4), - 1 is not a square mod p (Chapter 111-2), so 
for i#=i' L(i - i') - - L(i' - i). This will be useful in showing our general 
example is Hadamard. Note also that for a #= 0, L(a) - U), so we have 
L(a)L(b) - L(ab) whenever a, b #=0. 
Define an n X n matrix S - (S(i,J), where i = 00, 1, 2, ... , n - 1 are 
the rows andj -
00, 1, 2, ... , n - 1 are the columns, by 
S(i, 00) - 1 
S(oo,j) - -1 
S(i,j) - L(i - j) 
where again L(O) - 0, and 
for all i, 
for allj #= 00, 
for i,j #= 00, 
L(i-j) - C~j) fori #=j. 
Theorem. S is a Hadamard matrix. 
PROOF. We verify that the rows of S are pairwise orthogonal. 
First suppose i, i' #= 00. Then the scalar product of the ith and i'th row is 
p 
S(i, oo)S(i', 00) + ~ S(i,j)S(i',j) 
j=i 
p 
-
1 + L(i - i)L(i' - i) + L(i - i')L(i' - i') + ~ L«i - j)L(i' - j». 
j=i 
H=i,i' 
Since L(O) - 1 and L( -1) - - 1 (because p == 3 (mod 4» the second and 
third terms cancel. Since L(i - j)L(i' - j) - L«i - j)(i' - j» for j #=i, i', 
the above scalar product equals 
p 
I + ~ L«i - j)(i' - i + i - j». 
j=i 
j'Fi, i' 
Let a - i' - i, and let c - i - j. Then c takes on the values 1, ... , p, 
omittingp and -a. So this sum becomes 
p 
1 + 
~ L(c(a + c». 
Since L(c2) -
1, this equals 
c=i 
C'FP, -Q 
Set e - 1 + (aj c); as c runs through the numbers 1 through p - 1, 
missing - a, e runs through the numbers 2 through p - 1; thus the sum 

302 
17 Duplicate Bridge Tournaments 
becomes 
p-i 
I + ~ L(e). 
e=2 
Since L(I) = I this becomes 
p-i 
~ L(e). 
e=1 
By Exercise EIO of the last chapter, this sum is 0, as we wished to show. 
If i = 00, the scalar product of the 00 and i'th rows is 
p 
S( 00, 00 )S(i', (0) + ~ S( oo,j)S(i',j). 
j=1 
For j =1= 00, S( oo,j) = - I, so the sum is 
p 
I -
~ S(i',j) 
j=1 
P 
= I -
~ L(i' - j). 
j=1 
Setting i' - j = c this becomes 
p-.I 
I - L(O) -
~ L( c) = 0 
c=1 
for the same reasons as above. Thus the rows of S are orthogonal, and S is 
a Hadamard matrix, completing the proof.

El. Show that there is no 3 X 3 Hadamard matrix. 
*E2. Are there any 6 x 6 Hadamard matrices? 
B. Duplicate Bridge Tournaments 
A complete round-robin duplicate bridge tournament works as follows. 
There are n partnerships, where n is a multiple of 2. A board is a deal of 
the playing cards into four hands of 13 cards each, located in positions N, 
E, S, W. A partnership plays the N-S hands head-to-head against a 
partnership playing the E-W hands. In a complete tournament each 
partnership plays once head-to-head against each of the n - I other 
partnerships, each on a different board, so there are n - I boards. Each 
board is played n /2 times. 
Scoring works as follows. Each board is played by all partnerships, half 
playing it N-S, half playing it E-W. After all partnerships have played the 

C Bridge for 8 
303 
1?oard, the partnerships playing E-W are compared and linearly ordered 
based on how well they did; similarly the partnerships playing N-S. 
Suppose, for example, n = 8, the partnerships are labeled 1, ... , 7 and 00, 
and the results on a given board were as follows: 
N-S 
vs. 
E-W 
Result 
I 
2 
420 points for N-S 
that is, partnership 1 played the N-S hands head-to-head against partner-
ship 2 and the result of the play was that the N-S partnership (= 
partnership 1) scored 420 points-and partnership 2 gave up 420 points. 
(We need not go into how individual hands of bridge are played and 
scored.) 
N-S 
3 
5 
7 
vs. 
E-W 
4 
6 
00 
Result 
100 points for E-W 
420 points for N-S 
400 points for N-S 
Then among N-S players, partnerships 1 and 5 did best, then 7, then 3, 
who did worst. Among their opponents playing E-W, the ordering is 
reversed: 4 did best, then 00, finally 2 and 6. The scoring would be to give 
the worst 0, next 1, next 2, best 3. Ties split the scores. On the illustrated 
board the scoring would come out as follows: 
Partnership 
Score 
I 
2.5 
2 
.5 
345 
o 
3 
2.5 
6 
.5 
7 
00 
I 
2 
Thus there are three kinds of relationships on a given board. Partner-
ship 1, for example, plays head-to-head against 2, competes against 3, 5, 7 
but plays with 4, 6, 00. The best result for 1 on this board is for 1 to do well 
against 2 and have 4,6, 00 do well against 3,5, 7. 
In designing a bridge tournament one wants any two partnerships A 
and B to pay head-to-head on one board, and on the others, compete 
against each other exactly as many times as they play with each other. 
One way to do this is to design the tournament using the Hadamard 
matrices we constructed. 
C. Bridge for 8 
We illustrate the general construction by describing an 8 partnership 
tournament. 
Let S be the 8 X 8 Hadamard matrix of Example 8, Section A. 
The matrix S has the following significance. The row numbers i are the 
partnerships. Delete the 00 column; then the remaining column numbers 
are the boards. The entry S(i,j), called the side function, defines whether 

304 
17 Duplicate Bridge Tournaments 
partnership i plays boardj as N-S (if SO,j) = + 1) or E-W (if S(i,j) = 
-1). 
If we can arrange the tournament to have partnership i play board j 
according to the matrix S, then since the rows of S are orthogonal (before 
deleting the 00 column), each pair of partnerships i l and i2 will play 
head-to-head once, play with each other three times, and compete against 
each other three times. For since S(i, 00)S(i2' 00) + "2.J_ IS(il,})S(i2,j) = 0, 
being the scalar product of rows i l and i2 of the matrix S, and since 
SOl' 00)S(i2' 00) = 1, we have 
7 
~ S(il,j)S(i2,j) = -1. 
j-l 
Since S(il,j)S(i2,}) = 1 or -1 for eachj, there must be three boardsj for 
which S(i1,})S(i2,j) = 1, i.e., S(il,j) = S(i2,}), i.e., i l and i2 are playing the 
same direction (e.g., E-W) and competing against each other, and four 
boards for which S(i1,}) = - S(i2'})' i.e., i l and i2 are playing in opposite 
directions, i.e., playing with each other or playing head-to-head. Since they 
play head-to-head only once in the tournament, they must play with each 
other on three boards. 
We have to distribute the partnerships and the boards. To do that is to 
specify on which round partnership i is to play boardj. A round is a period 
of time when certain boards are being played. An efficiently designed 
tournament would have exactly as many rounds as boards, in this case 
seven, and would have each partnership playing on a given round. 
Here is a way to arrange the partnerships and the boards. Define a 
function R(i,}), the round function, for i = 00, 1, 2, ... ,7, and j = 
1, ... ,7, by: 
R( oo,j) = 3j (mod 7); 
R(i,j) = 3j + (i - j)L(i - j) (mod 7) if i =1= 00. 
Here L(i - j) is, as before, 1 if i = j and C~j) if i =l=j. Then R(i,}) = r is 
interpreted to mean that partnership i plays boardj in round r. 
We must verify of the function R the following. 
(l) Given partnership i and board j there is exactly one other partner-
ship i' =l=i playing boardj on the same round as i: symbolically, 
R(i',j) = R(i,j) for exactly one i' =1= i; 
for such an i', S(i',j)S(i,}) = - 1, i.e., one partnership is playing N-S, the 
other E-W. 
(2) Each partnership is playing one and only one board in a given 
round: R(i, -) is a 1-1 function of j for each fixed i.

Using the round function we can describe the design. Here it is, in the 
form of a table.

The circled entry 3 + means that partnership 5 in round 4 plays board 3 as 
N-S. 
The table is obtained by finding for each partnership i and each round r 
the unique board} such that R(i,}) = r, then computing Sci,}). 
In setting up the table it is convenient to have a function B(i, r), a 
board function, so that B(i, r) =} means that in round r, r = 1, ... , 7, 
partnership i plays board}. For fixed i, B(i, r) is then the inverse function 
to the function R(i,}): B(i, r) = } iff B(i,}) = r. 
Here is the function B. It is defined mod 7: 
r 
B(oo r) = - = 5,-
, 
3 
' 
B(i r) = {(r-i)/(3-1)=4(r-i) 
, 
(r+i)/(3+1)=2(r+i) 
if L(3i - r) = 1 
if L(3i - r) = -1. 
It is easy to check that for i = 00, B( 00, r) and R( oo,}) are inverse 
functions. When i =F 00 it is a bit harder. 
For i =F 00, we show R(i, B(i, r)) = r by computing 
R(i, B(i, r» = 3B(i, r) + (i - BU, r»L(i - BU, r». 
First suppose L(3i - r) = 1. Then 
i - BU, r) = i - (4(r - i» 
= 5i - 4r == 4(3i - r) (mod 7). 
Since 4 is a square mod 7, L(i - B(i, r)) = l. Thus 
R(i, B(i, r» = R(i, 4(r - i» 
= 3(4(r - i) + (i - B(i, r» 
= 12(r - i) + 4(3i - r) 
= 8r ==r (mod 7) 

306 
17 Duplicate Bridge Tournaments 
Now suppose L(3i - r) = - 1. Then i - B(i, r) = i - (2(r + i» = - 2r 
- i == 2(3i - r) (mod 7). So L(i - B(i, r» = L(2(3i - r» = L(2)L(3i - r) 
= - 1 (since L(2) = L(42) = 1). Thus 
R(i, B(i, r)) = R(i, 2(r + i)) = 3(2(r + i)) - (-2r - i) 
= 8r + 7i == r (mod 7). 
FA. Verify for i =1= 00 that B(i, R(i,j» = j. 
By showing that B(i, -) is the inverse function of R(i, -), we have in 
particular verified property (2) above for R(i, -). 
To obtain the circled entry in the table above, we compute B(5, 4). 
Since L(II) = L(4) = 1, B(5, 4) = 4(4 - 5) = - 4 = 3. 
D. Bridge for p + 1 
We consider p + 1 players, where p is a prime == 3 mod 4. The technique 
used in obtaining the 8 partnership tournament works for designing 
tournaments with n = 4m players where n - 1 = p > 3 is prime: for exam-
ple, n = 12, 20, 24, 32, 44, 48 . .. . Here is how it is done. 
We use the general example of a Hadamard matrix S described in 
Section A. Thus its entries are defined by the "side" function 
S(oo,))=-1 
for)=1,2, ... ,p, 
S(i,)) = L(i - ) 
for i =1= 00,) = 1, 2, ... ,p, 
where if i - ) =1= 0, 
L(i - ) 
= e;)), 
the Legendre symbol. 
The interpretation of S is that S(i,) = s means: partnership i plays 
board) as { ~~) if s = { _ ~ }. As in the 8 partnership case, if we arrange 
partnerships an boards according to S we will have a well designed 
tournament. 
To complete the design we define the round function R(i,) as follows. 
We pick some b =l=p so that b + 1 and b - 1 are nonzero quadratic residues 
mod p. Then we set 
R(oo,) = b) 
R(i,) = b) + (i - )L(i -) if i =1= 00 (modp). 
Note that with n = 8 and p = 7, b = 3 satisfies the conditions we desire. 
Note also that in the verification R(i, B(i, r» = r we needed that 2 and 4 
were squares mod 7.

E5. Show that for any p ;;. 7, b can be chosen to be either 2, 3, or 5. 
We must verify: 
(1) R(i,) = R(i',)for exactly one i' *- i, and for that i', S(i,)S(i',) = -1; 
(2) R( i, -), as a function of one variable with i fixed, is 1-1. 
In the verifications all arithmetic is mod p. 
PROOF OF (1). If i = 00, R(oo,) = R(i,) iff b) = b) + (i - )L(i -) for 
some i. Now the latter equation is unsolvable if i *-), for then (i - )L(i -
) *- O. Thus R( 00,) = R(i,) exactly when i = 00 or); in the latter case, 
S(oo,)S(j,) = - 1. 
If i, i' *- 00, and R(i,) = R(i',), then) *-i, i' by the last paragraph 
(otherwise both would equal R(oo,)). So R(i,) = R(i',) iff b) + (i-
)L(i - ) = b) + (i' - )L(i' - ) iff (i - )L(i - ) = (i' - )L(i' - i). If i' *-
i, this is true only if L(i - ) = - L(i' -i) and i - ) = - (i' - i), or i' = 2) 
- i. So there is at most one i' *- i satisfying R(i,) = R(i',). 
Conversely, if i' = 2) - i, then L(i' -) = L(2) - i - ) = L( -(i -
i»~ = 
L( -l)L(i - ) = - L(i -) since p == 3 (mod 4). So i' = 2) - i is the 
unique solution of R(i,) = RU',) with i' *- i and neither = 00. Evidently 
S(i,j)S(i',) = - 1. 
0 
PROOF OF (2). To show R(i, i), for fixed i, is 1-1 as a function of ), we 
define the board function B(i, r), which will, for fixed i, be the inverse of 
R(i,): 
r 
B(oo, r) = b 
(b- 1 makes sense since (b,p) = 1); 
B(i r) = {(r-i)/(b-l) 
, 
(r + i) / (b + 1) 
if L( bi - r) = 1 
if L(bi - r) = -1. 
E6. Show that BU, R(i,})) =} and R(i, BU, r)) = r for all i,}, r. 
Once you show that, (2) is proved. 
Using Sand R or B one can set up a bridge tournament for any n 
partnerships where n = 4m and n - 1 is prime. 
The description of bridge tournament design we have described comes 
from Berlekamp and Hwang (1972). They also describe designs for n 
partnerships where n *- 4m. The Hadamard matrices used in the design 
were discovered by R.E.A.C. Paley in 1933. Hadamard matrices have 
application also in statistical design of experiments, in telephone circuitry, 
and in biology. The problem of finding for which n there exist n X n 
Hadamard matrices is an active research area in combinatorial mathemat-

Algebraic Number Fields 18 
Any non constant polynomial with rational coefficients has roots in the 
complex numbers. Those complex numbers which are roots of polynomials 
with rational coefficients are called algebraic numbers. Examples are V2 , 
i, V'5 , 2 + V3 . 
The discovery that there were algebraic numbers which are not rational 
was made in the fifth century B. C., when the irrationality of V2 , the 
length of the diagonal of a square of side 1, was discovered by an ill-fated 
Greek mathematician of the school of Pythagoras. It was such a startling 
discovery to the Pythagoreans that the discoverer was reputedly drowned 
for the crime of heresy. But once the Greeks got over the shock of realizing 
that reality was not rational, they discovered a large quantity of irrational 
algebraic numbers which can be represented as lengths of line segments 
constructed by straightedge and compass. 
There are many complex numbers which are not algebraic, that is, not 
roots of polynomials with rational coefficients. Those numbers which are 
not algebraic are called transcendental. Proving that a given number is not 
algebraic is invariably an impressive achievement. The most famous results 
are that e is transcendental (Hermite, 1873), that '1T is transcendental 
(Lindemann, 1882), and that if a and b are algebraic with a =1= 0, 1 and b 
not rational, then a b is transcendental (Gelfond, 1934; Schneider, 1935). 
For an exposition of these results, see Niven (1956). 
We can get many fields made up of algebraic numbers, in the following 
way. Let a be an algebraic number, which is a root of a polynomialp(x) in 
Q[x] of degree d. We consider the evaluation homomorphism 
CPa : O[x]~C 
given by cpAp(x» = p(a). The image of CPa is the set of all polynomials in a 
with rational coefficients. Call that image O[a]. 

310 
18 Algebraic Number Fields 
Theorem. O[ a] is a field. 
Before proving this let us look "at some examples. 
ExAMPLE I. Let a = i. Of course i is a root of x2 + I so i is an algebraic 
number. We consider O[i] C C, the set of all polynomials in i with rational 
coefficients. Claim: ali] consists of elements of the form a + bi, a, b 
rational. For letp(x) be any polynomial in O[x]. By the division algorithm 
there is some quotient q(x) in O[x] and some remainder r(x) = a + bx in 
O[x] such that in O[x], 
p(x) = (x2 + I)q(x) + (a + bx). 
(I) 
Now evaluate (I) at x = i. Since i2 + I = 0, we get an equality of complex 
numbers, 
pU) = a + bi. 
lt is easy to check that ali] is a ring, either by directly checking the 
axioms, or by using the general principle: 
If R, S are rings and I/» : R->;S is a ring homomorphism, then q,(R), the 
image of 1/», is a ring. 
(See E8.) In fact, O[i] is a field, because if a + bi is a nonzero element of 
O[i], it has an inverse in C, namely a/(a2 + b2) - ib/(a2 + b2), and this is 
again an element of O[ i]. 
EXAMPLE 2. Let a = Y2 , and consider O[Y2]. Since Y2 is a root of 
x 2 - 2, Y2 is an algebraic number. One shows as with O[i] that if p(x) is 
any polynomial in O[x], there are q(x), a, b such that 
p(x) = q(x)(x2 - 2) + a + bx; 
it follows that in C, 
p(Y2) = a + bY2 
for some a, b in O. Thus O(Y2) = a + b Y2 in C, a, b rational numbers. 
As before, O(Y2 ) is a ring. 
(Multiplication works using (Y2 )2 = 2 as follows: 
(a + bY2 )(c + dY2) = ac + (ad + bc)Y2 + bd(Y2)2 
= (ac + 2bd) + (ad + bc)Y2 . 
To check that Q[Y2 ] is a field we again observe that nonzero elements 
of Q[Y2 ] have inverses in Q[Y2 ]: 
1/ (a + bY2) = 
a - bY2 
= 
a 
_ ( 
b 
)Y2 
(a+bY2)(a-bY2)

a2 -2b2 
•

(Note that a2 - 2b2 is never zero unless a = b = 0, for otherwise V2 
would be a rational number.) 
EXAMPLE 3. Let w = (-1 v=-3 )/2, a complex number satisfying w3 = 1, 
and let a = w(~ ). Then O[ a] is all polynomials in a = w(~ ), that is, all 
rational linear combinations of 1, a, a 2, a 3, ... , an, ... , a subring of the 
complex numbers. 
Evidently a is a root of the irreducible polynomial x 3 - 2 in O[x], so 
a 3 = 2. Thus we can describe any power of a. If m is any positive integer, 
write m = 3n + k, with k = 0, 1 or 2. Then am = a3n + k = 2na k • So every 
power of a is a O-multiple of 1, a, or a 2• It is then very easy to see that 
every polynomial in a with rational coefficients can be written as a 
O-linear combination of 1, a and a2. 
El. Show that if al + b1a + cIa2 = a2 + b2a + C2a2 in Ora], then al = a2, bi = 
b2, CI = C2· 
We can show that Ora] is a field, that is, every nonzero element of Ora] 
has an inverse in Ora], by using Bezout's lemma. 
Let f(a) = a + ba + ca2 =1= 0 be in Ora]. Since p(x) = x 3 - 2 is irreduc-
ible in O[x], the greatest common divisor of p(x) andf(x) = a + bx + cx2 
is 1. So there are r(x) and s(x) in O[x] withp(x)r(x) + f(x)s(x) = 1. Setting 
x = a, we get that f(a)s(a) = 1 (since p(a) = 0), so f(a) has an inverse in 
Ora]. 
Before stating the following theorem, recall (Chapter III-8B) that if a is 
algebraic over 0, then there is a unique monic irreducible polynomialp(x) 
in O[x] with a as a root. We calledp(x) the minimal polynomial of a over 
O. 
E2. Prove that there is such a polynomialp(x) without looking at Chapter III-S. 
Theorem. Let a in C be an algebraic number. Then O[ a] is a field. In fact, 
let p(x) be the minimal polynomial of a over O. Then Ora] is isomorphic to 
O[xJ/p(x). 
PROOF. It is easy to check that the set of polynomials in a, Ora], is a 
commutative ring with identity. Let f(a) be a nonzero element of Ora], 
where f(x) is a polynomial ill O[x]. The p(x) does not divide f(x), so 
1 = f(x)r(x) + p(x)s(x) for some polynomials r(x) and s(x) in O[x] (since 
p(x) is irreducible). The 1 = f(a)r(a). So f(a) has an inverse. Since every 
nonzero element of O[ a] has an inverse, O[ a] is a field. 
To prove that Ora] is isomorphic to O[x]/(p(x», we let 
cp : O[x]/(p(x»~O[aJ by cp([f(x)]) = f(a), where [f(x)] denotes the con-
gruence class of the polynomial f(x). Since cp(a) = a for a in 0, and

q,([x]) - a, a root of p(x), 4> is well defined (see Chapter 10, Proposition 4). 
It is easy to see that 4> is a homomorphism. Since Q[x]/(p(x» is a field, 4> 
is 1-1 (Chapter 10, Exercise EI4). Since any polynomialf(a) in Q[a).is the 
image under 4> of the corresponding congruence class [J(x)], 4> is onto. So 4> 
is an isomorphism. That completes the proof. 
0 
Note. We could have omitted the first paragraph of this proof. For since 
Q[ a] is isomorphic to a field, it also must be a field. 
A consequence of the isomorphism is that every element of Q[ a] can be 
written as a polynomial in a of degree < n, the degree of p(x). 
Note. The is nothing special about Q in this last example. If F is any 
subfield of C, and a is a complex number which satisfies an irreducible 
polynomial in F[x] of degree n, then F[a] is a field. 
ExAMPLE. When F - R, a - i, then R[i] - C itself. 
Consider how many fields we have discovered in this course. At the 
start you probably only knew three of them, Q, R and C. How many do 
you know now? 
In introducing the theorem of this chapter, we said that we were going 
to describe fields of algebraic numbers. In fact, if a is an algebraic number, 
then all the elements of Q[a] are algebraic numbers. This is the content of 
Proposition 2, Chapter III-S. 
Using some linear algebra one can prove also the following. 
*E3. (a) If "y is algebraic over Q[a] (that is, "y is a root of a polynomial with 
coefficients in Q[a]) where a is algebraic over Q, then"y is algebraic over

We showed in the last chapter that if a is a complex number which is a 
root of the irreducible polynomialp(x) in lQ[x], then lQ[x]/(p(x»-IQ[a] 
by the function which sends [f(x)] to f(a). 
Since lQ[x]/(p(x)-IQ[a], why not say lQ[x]/(p(x) = lQ[a]? The dif-
ference is that lQ[x]/(p(x» is a formally constructed system, while lQ[a] is 
a subset of C, so is more "real" (and, in particular, may be thought of as a 
set of points in the plane). It turns out also that there may be more than 
one subfield of C which is isomorphic to lQ[x]/(p(x». For example, x 3 - 2 
has three roots in C, T2 , wT2 , and w2T2 , where w = e(2i'lT/3) satisfies 
w3 = 1. We can define three ring homomorphisms from lQ[x]/(x3 - 2) into 
C, given by sending [f(x)lx3-2 to f(Y2), f(wT2), or f(w2T2). So, in 
particular, 
IQ[ x]! (x 3 - 2) -1Q[T2], 
lQ[x]j(x3-2) -1Q[w~], 
IQ[ x]j (x3 - 2) -
IQ[ w2T2 J. 
Now 1Q[T2] and lQ[wT2] are really different subsets of C: the first is a 
subset of ~, while the second satisfies lQ[wT2] n ~ = IQ. 
The topic of isomorphisms of fields leads into the beautiful subject of 
Galois theory of fields, for which we refer you to a more advanced book 
on algebra (such as Herstein (1964», noting only that Galois theory is the 
tool one uses to prove the theorem of Abel cited in Chapter 11-3.

Inside any algebraic number field K is the set of numbers of K which 
satisfy a monic polynomial with coefficients in 71. (not just in 0). The set of 
these numbers is called the ring of integers of K, and turns out to be a ring 
containing 71., but not a field. 
Here is a particularly interesting example. Inside O[ i] is the set G of 
integers of O[i], called by the special name of the Gaussian integers. We 
want to know exactly which numbers are in G. 
Proposition. G = {a + bila, b in 71.}, that is, a = a + bi satisfies a monic 
polynomial with coefficients in 71. if and only if a and b are in 71.. 
PROOF. First, if a = a + bi is in O[i], then a is a root of the polynomial 
Po(x) = (x - (a + bi))(x - (a - bi)) = x 2 -
2ax + (a2 + b2), 
which is in O[x] since a, b are in O. If b =l=O,po(x) is irreducible, because it 
has no roots in O. 
Suppose a = a + bi where a and b are in 71.. Then Po(x) is a monic 
polynomial with coefficients in 71., so a is in G. 
Conversely, suppose a is in G. We want to show that a and b are in 71.. 
Since a is in G, a satisfies some monic polynomialp(x) with coefficients 
in 71.. Since Po(x) is irreducible and has a as a root, Po(x) must divide p(x). 
Let p(x) = Po(x)q(x). Since p(x) is a polynomial with integer 
coefficients, Gauss's lemma tells us that there are rational numbers r, s 
such that rpo(x) and sq(x) are in 71.[x] and p(x) = (rpo(x»(sq(x». Since p(x) 
is monic, the leading coefficient of rpo(x) must be + 1 or -1. But Po(x) is 
monic. So r must be + 1 or -1, which means that since rpo(x) has 
coefficients in 71., Po(x) has coefficients in 71.. 

20 Sums of Two Squares 
317 
Since Po(x) has coefficients in 71., 2a and a2 + b2 must be in 71.. Hence 
4(a2 + b2) - (2af = 4b2 is in 71.. Since 2b is in (Q and (2bi is in 71., 2b must 
be in 71.. Write a = r/2, b = s/2 with r, sin 71.. Now 
a2 + b2 = (1 r 
+ ( 1 r 
= ( r2 ; S2 ) 
is in 71.. So 4 divides r2 + S2. But this can only happen in case rand s are 
both even. (Why?) Thus b and a are in 71.. 
Thus G is the set of all complex numbers of the form a + bi, a, b in 71., 
as we wished to prove. 
0 
It is easy to check that G is a commutative ring. It turns out that G is 
almost as "nice" as 71., in the sense that just like 71. or F[x], G has a division 
algorithm, a Euclidean algorithm, unique factorization, etc. We shall 
develop these facts in the process of proving a very elegant result of Gauss, 
which illustrates in a small way how knowledge of algebraic numbers and 
finite fields contributes to knowledge of ordinary numbers. 
Theorem. An odd prime number p (in 71.) is the sum of two squares if and only 
if p is congruent to I mod 4. 
Try some examples. 
We shall divide the proof up into a number of steps. Some of them will 
be exercises. 
PROOF. Part of the proof is easy. 
(i) Suppose p is an odd prime and p = a2 + b2. Then p cannot be 
congruent to 3 (mod 4) because a2 + b2 cannot be congruent to 3 (mod 4) 
for any integers a, b. 
El. Why? 
The converse, showing that if p is congruent to 1 (mod 4), then p is the 
sum of two squares, is much more involved, and uses the Gaussian integers 
G in an essential way. 
(ii) Any complex number has a norm associated with it which is a real 
number: N(a + bi) = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a2 + b2. N(a + bi) is the square of 
the length of the complex number a + bi thought of as a vector in real 
2-space. 
(a) The norm of the product of two complex numbers is equal to the 
product of the norms of the two numbers. 
(b) If a + bi is in G, then N(a + bi) is a positive integer, unless a = b = O. 
(c) Say that a + bi is a unit of G if a + bi is in G and there is another 
element of G, c + di, such that their product (a + bi)(c + di) = 1. Then 
a Gaussian integer is a unit if and only if it has norm = I, and so the 
only units of G are I, - I, i and - i.

E2. Prove these assertions. 
(iii) For G we have a 
Division 1heorem. If a =t= 0, f3 are in G, there exist (J and p in G with 
N(P) <:. N(a)/2 such that f3 = a(J + p. 
Note. The quotient and remainder are not unique, however, since, for 
example, 
7 + 6i = 4(2 + i) + ( - I + 2i) = 4(2 + 2i) + ( - I - 2i). 
PROOF OF THE DMSION THEOREM. To find (J, p, we first observe that 
f3 = a(J + p if and only if af3 = aaO + ap where a = a - bi is the complex 
c01\iugate of a = a + bi; also N(P) <:. N(a)/2 iff N(ap) <:. N(aa)/2. 
Thus since aa = c, an integer > 0, it suffices to prove the division 
theorem with a = c, a positive integer. So we shall prove that given f3 in G, 
c > 0 in l, there are (J, p with f3 = c(J + p and N(P) <:. N(c)/2 = c2/2. 
Let f3 = a + bi. We want to choose (J = e + fi so that N(f3 - cO) <:. c2/2, 
that is, 
(a - ce)2 + (b - cff <:. c2/2. 
Now the numbers a - ce, for e in l, are c units apart on the real line. So 
one of them is within c /2 of O. Thus there is some integer eo such that 
a - ceo <:. c /2. Also, there is some integer fo so that b - clo <:. c /2. But then 
N«a + bi) - c(eo + foi) = (a - ceof + (b - CIO)2 
<:. c2 / 4 + c2 / 4 = c2/2. 
Setting p = (a - ceo) + (b - clo)i, (J = eo + loi proves the division theorem. o 
(iv) Given the division theorem we get a Euclidean algorithm, a greatest 
common divisor of two elements of G, a Bezout's lemma, etc. 
E3. Why can't the Euclidean algorithm go on forever in 6? 
E4. Show that even though the remainder in the division algorithm need not be 
unique, the greatest common divisor of two elements of 6 must be unique, in 
the sense that if 8), 82 are both greatest common divisors of two numbers II 
and P of G, then 8) = £82, where £ is an unit of 6. 
We shall call a prime of 6 an element with norm > I which cannot be 
factored into a product of two other elements of 6 with norms > 1. 
ES. Show that if f1 is a prime of 6 and f1 divides liP, then f1 divides II or f1 divides 
p. 
Let us return now to the problem of when a prime is the sum of two 
squares.

(v) An element n of 7L. is a sum of two squares in 7L. if and only if n is the 
norm of an element of G. 
For n = a2 + b2 means that n = N(a + bi). This gives a criterion for 
deciding when a prime is a sum of two squares in 7L.-when it is a norm of 
an element of G. 
(vi) Recall the fact about the field 7L.p of congruence classes mod p, that 
7L.p has a primitive element s, so that every nonzero element of 7l.p is a 
power of s. If p is congruent to I (mod 4), and if s is a primitive element of 
7L.p' then s(p-l/4) is an element of 7L.p whose square = [-I]p in 7L.p• 
Thus there is some b in 7L. such that b2 + 1=0 (modp) (this was 
Theorem I of Chapter 111-4; see also 111-4, E7, which gives an explicit b, 
namely b = «p - 1)/2)!). 
(vii) Now we can prove the converse part of the theorem. 
Letp be a prime of 7L. withp = I (mod 4). We want to show thatp is the 
sum of two squares in 7L.. 
• 
We know that there is some b in 7L. which satisfies b2 + I = 0 (mod p). 
Thus b2 + 1= pd for some integer d. Thus in G, (b + i)(b - i) = pd. If p 
were a prime in G, then p would have to divide b + i or b - i, by Exercise 
E5. But this is not true: for if pea + ci) = (b + i), with a, c in 7L., then 
pc = I, which is impossible. The casep(a + ci) = b - i is just as impossible. 
So p cannot be a prime in G. Thus p must factor in G : p = ap, with 
N(a) > I, N(P) > 1. Taking norms, we get p2 = N(p) = N(a)N(p). Since 
N(a) and N(P) are integers> I which dividep2, therefore N(a) = N(P) = 
p. By part (v), p is therefore the sum of two squares. That proves the 
theorem.

Notice that E5 played a crucial role in the proof, and E5 depended on 
knowing that in G there is a division theorem and a Euclidean algorithm. 
So all parts of the proof were needed. 
E6. State and prove a theorem about uniqueness of factorization of elements of G

(c) In IE we can factor 9 in two ways as follows: 
9 = 3·3 = (2+v=5)(2-v=5). 
Prove that in E, the numbers 3, 2 + v=5, and 2 - v=5 are all 
irreducible. (Hint: Try using the norm of a complex number, and the fact 
that N(ap) = N(a)N(p).) 
(d) Conclude that unique factorization does not hold in IE. 

21 On Unique Factorization 
In this book, we have been studying fields, such as 0, ~, I p ' and simple 
extensions of these, and commutative rings such as I, F[ x], or, in the last 
chapter, G. 
For each of I, F[x] (F a field), and G we proved a theorem about 
uniqueness of factorization into products of primes. The statement of each 
such theorem was as follows. Let R be the commutative ring we were 
studying (R = I, F[x], or G). A unit of R is an element u for which there is 
a v in R with uv = 1. An irreducible element of R is a nonzero nonunit P 
which does not factor into P = ab with a, b nonunits in R. Two elements 
PI' P2 of R are associates if PI = UP2 for some unit u of R. Then uniqueness 
of factorization says: any nonzero nonunit of R factors uniquely, up to 
associates, into a product of irreducible elements of R. This means that for 
any nonunit a (=1= 0) of R there are irreducible elements PI' ... ,p, of R, 
not necessarily all distinct, such that 
a = P,P2' .. P,; 
if also 
a = q,q2 ... qs 
with ql, ... , qs irreducible, then s = r and there is a 1-1 correspondence 
between the set {p" ... ,p,} and the set {q" ... , qs} such that if Pi 
corresponds to qp then Pi and lJ; are associates. 
Note. This theorem holds even if R is a field for the trivial reason that in 
a field there are no nonzero non units. 
In Chapter 20, Exercise E7, we gave an example of a commutative ring 
IE for which uniqueness of factorization does not hold. That example is 
more typical of commutative rings than examples of rings with uniqueness 

21 On Unique Factorization

of factorization. This fact was first discovered by mathematicians working 
with algebraic numbers. 
Given any field of algebraic numbers O[a]!: C, we can investigate the 
ring of integers Oa of Ora], and ask whether Oa has unique factorization. 
This question has been answered for many algebraic number fields. 
For example, consider O[W] where d is a negative square-free integer. 
We already looked at the case d = - 1 in the last chapter, and d = - 5 in 
Exercise E7 of the last chapter. When d = - 1 there was uniqueness of 
factorization; when d = - 5 there was not. It turns out that the ring of 
integers of O[W] has uniqueness of factorization for only nine negative 
valuesofd-d=-l, -2, -3, -7, -11, -19, -43, -67, and -163-
and for no other d < o. (That those were the only ones was proved only in 
1966 by H. M. Stark.) 
An example that is highly interesting both intrillsically and historically 
is the ring l[n polynomials in t with coefficients in l, where t = e2ir}/p is 
apth root of 1, andp is an odd prime. Then l[t] t1lf1lS out to be the ring of 
integers of the algebraic number field O[n and is of particular interest 
because of Fermat's last theorem (Chapter III-2). 
Suppose we wanted to show that there are no x, y, z, aij nonzero with 
x p + yp = zP in l. If there are such integers, we can assume that the 
greatest common divisor of x,y and z is 1, and thatpfz. (For if plz, then 
pf y and xP + (- z)p = (-y)p, so we could replace y, z by - z, - y.) 
Now in l[t], 
zP = x P + yP 
= (x + y)(x + ty)(x + t).» ... (x + tP-Y). 
(*) 
If l[t] has unique factorization, it can be shown that the factors on the 
right side are pairwise relatively prime, from which it follows, again by 
unique factorization, that because of (*), for each i, i = 0, 1, ... ,p - 1, 
x + ty is the associate of apth power of an element of l[n 
These arguments are the first steps in a fairly subtle proof by Kummer, 
in 1840, of 
Theorem. If l[t] has uniqueness of factorization, where t = e2'1Ti/P, p an odd 
prime, then there are no integers x, y, z, all nonzero, with xP + yP = zp. 
When Kummer found this proof, he came quickly to the discovery that 
l[t] does not always have unique factorization. In fact, l[t] is known to 
have unique factorization only for t = e2'1Ti/p , p ~ 19. Kummer's attempts 
to find a substitute for unique factorization in his proof led to the notion 
of an ideal-an ideal being for Kummer something invented to act as a 
substitute in a ring R for a greatest common divisor of two numbers when 
the two numbers did not have a greatest common divisor in R.

21 On Unique Factorization 
The concept of ideal has been refined to become the following 
Definition. An ideal of a commutative ring R is a subset I of R such that 
(i) for any a, b in I, a + b is in I, and 
(ii) for any a in I, r in R, ra is in I. 
An ideal I is principal if there is some d in I so that every element of I is a 
multiple of d. 
The reason the concept of ideal has not arisen before in this book is 
because of 
Proposition. In lL, F[x] (F a field) and G, every ideal is principal. 
PROOF FOR lL. Given an ideal I, if I contains a nonzero number, then I 
contains a positive number (for if b is in I, so is - b). Let d be the smallest 
positive number in I. Then every number of I is a multiple of d. For if e is 
in I, e":f= 0, let (e, d) = r; then r ..;; d. Now by Bezout's lemma, there are x, 
yin lL such that xe + yd = r. But since d, e are in I, so is xe + yd = r. Since 
d was the least positive number in I, and r ..;; d, then r = d and so d divides 
~ 
0 
The proofs for F[x] and G are essentially the same. 
In lL[v=5], the set of atl elements of the form (2 + v=5)a + 
3b, a, b in lL[v=5 ], is an ideal which is not principal. 
The subject of ideals in rings of integers of algebraic number fields and 
other commutative rings is well-developed; we leave it for you to study 
elsewhere, except for a few exercises. For a full discussion of Fermat's last 
theorem, see Borevich and Shafarevich (1966, pp. 156-164, 378-381, or 
Ribenboim (1979).

Now since sign(gi(x»· sign(j,,(x» = sign(Ji(x», w(x), computed using the t's, is 
the same as w(x) computed using the ~'s as long as x is not a root of fn. Since 
gj_1 = qj~ - gj+ I' the argument in the text shows that w(x) computed using the g/s 
counts distinct roots of go. But the roots of go are the distinct roots of fo. so w(x) 
counts the distinct roots of fo and can be computed using the t's. 
11-11, E7. There are 4d+ I polynomials. If f(ni) = ri, i = 0, ... ,d, and s = 
(so, ... , Sd) is a vector of divisors of (ro, ... , rd)' then so is - s = ( - so, .. :, - Sd)' 
If a.(n;) = Si' then - a.(n;) = - Si = a_in;). Since a.(x) is uniquely determined by 
s, - a.(x) = a_.{x) and the interpolators pair off as associates.

Comments on the Starred Problems 
n·12, Ell. The remainder on dividing x P by f(x) = x 2 -
q is q(P-I)/2x . So q is a 
square in 1..p iff f(x) factors in 1..p.[x] iff there is b * 0 withf(x) dividing (a + bxy -
(a + bx) iff b*O and b(q(p-I)/2-1)=0 in 1..p iff q(p-I)/2= 1 in 1..r 
m·3, E3. (a) has the form 2p + 1; (b) is 215 -
1; (c) is 224 + I; (d) is a prime factor 
of a composite Fermat number. 
m·3, E4. It is a fact that c[l(n)/n can be as close to zero as you wish. This follows 
from Theorem 328 of Hardy and Wright (1960), the proof of which is difficult. 
m·s, E6. Let n = 2e'Pf' ... P:'. Let ao. ... , a,. be elements of maximal order in 
1..2-0, ••• , 1..p: r respectively. Then ao has order 2s, where s = eo - 1 if eo = 1 or 2, 
and s = eo - 2 for eo > 3; and ai has order c[l(p{i) = p{i-I(Pi - 1) if i = 1, ... , r; 
and h(n) = I.c.m.[2S , c[l(Pf'), ... , c[l(p:r)]. We consider two cases. 
Case 1. Two of the terms inside the brackets in the expression for h(n) are 
divisible by 2. Let t be the maximum power of 2 dividing h(n). Let i be such that 2' 
divides c[l(p{i); i = 0 if 2' = 2s• Letj * i be some index such that 2 divides CP(pJ'i) (if 
i * 0, j can = 0 if s > 0). Let x be a number satisfying the congruences 
x == ao (mod 2eo), 
x == al (modpf'), 
x == a] (modp)';), 
Then it is not hard to show that the order of x mod n is exactly h(n), and that 
x h(n)/2:E - 1 (mod n). To see the latter, note that if x h(n)/2 == - 1 (mod n), then 
(a]t(n)/2 == - I (modp/';), which is impossible. So use x as a spacing number. 
Case 2. Only one term is divisible by 2. Then either r = 0, s > 3 and the spacing 
number 3 works by Exercise E8 of Chapter 111·2, or else there is a primitive 
element mod n. In that case the h(n)/2 power of any primitive element must be 
== -I (mod n). 
111·6, E3. Show that there are no real roots, by calculus (show the minimum value 
of the polynomial is > 0); then show there is no factorization into factors of degree 
2 by "brute force" (11-8), using the inequalities on a and b. 
111·8, E2. In any field F of 16 elements, X l6 = x for all x in F by Fermat's theorem. 
So any field of 16 elements will do. 
m.l3, Ell. I do not know a nice way to do this problem, except if n is a prime 
power. 
m.l3, E13. Certainly Nt /pn < I/n. The worst case is when n = 2·3·5·7·11· 
13· .. ; then 
Nt = !(l-...!..-...!..-...!..+...!.._...!..+_I_- ... )

and the limit behaves iike I I n. 
ill-IS, E12. For part (a) replace cf>p, the function on lLq given by cf>/x) = x q, by 
complex conjugation in the proof, and copy the proof just as it appears in the text. 
The irreducible case is easy, since any irreducible polynomial with real coefficients 
has degree I or 2. For part (b), proceed as follows. From part (a), D(!) > 0 iff D(!) 
is a square iff d == r (mod 2), where r is the number of irreducible factors of f. Let 
rl = number of irreducible factors of degree I, r2 the number of degree 2. Then 
rl + 2r2 = d and rl = number of real roots. From d == r (mod 2) follows rl + 2r2 == 
rl + r2 (mod 2); hence r2 is even, r2 = 2k, and so rl = d - 4k. 
ill-IS, E3 and E4. If a is algebraic over a, then a[a] is an r-dimensional vector 
space over a (where r = degree of the minimal polynomial of a over a). Then if y 
is algebraic over a, y is algebraic over a[a]. If y is algebraic over a[a], then 
a[ a][ y] is a vector space of dimension s over a[ a], where s is the degree of the 
minimal polynomial of y over a[a]. But then the set of elements aiy with 
i = 0, I, ... , r - l,j = 0, I, ... , s - I, is a a-basis of a[a][y]. Now if K is a field 
containing a and is a d-dimensional vector space over a, then every element 13 of 
K must satisfy a polynomial with coefficients in a of degree .;; d, since 
1,13,13 2, ••• , f3d are d + I elements of K and so cannot be linearly independent 
over a; any equation of linear dependence describes a polynomial with coefficients 
in Q with 13 as a root. These remarks are the lemmas needed to prove E3 and E4. 
III-IS, Ell. For part (a) it may be convenient to prove by induction on n that both 
cos(nB) and sin(nB)sin(B) are polynomials in cos B, using the formulas for the sine 
and cosine of the sum of two angles. Part (b) is easy, and for part (c), let 
B = ('11/2) - ('l/ In) in part (a). 
1II-19, E6. If p(x) = (x - al)(x -
(2) ... (x - an) in F[x], F = a[ad, then any 
homomorphism (J from F to C sends r in a to itself (Exercise EI) and is 
determined by what it does to al. But (J(al) must be another root in C of p(x), 
hence must be ai for some i. So (J maps F to F, and the number of homomorphisms 
(J, which equals the number of elements of Aut(F), must equal the number of roots 
of p(x) in F, and this is n, the degree of p(x).
