Abstract
Biadjoint scalar ﬁeld theory has been the subject of much recent study, due to a number of
applications in ﬁeld and string theory. The catalogue of exact non-linear solutions of this theory
is relatively unexplored, despite having a role to play in extending known relationships between
gauge and gravity theories, such as the double copy. In this paper, we present new solutions of
biadjoint scalar theory, corresponding to singular line conﬁgurations in four spacetime dimen-
sions, with a power-law dependence on the cylindrical radius. For a certain choice of common
gauge group (SU(2)), a family of inﬁnitely degenerate solutions is found, whose existence can
be traced to the global symmetry of the theory. We also present extended solutions, in which
the pure power-law divergence is partially screened by a form factor.

Introduction
To the best of our current experimental knowledge, the forces of nature are described by (quan-
tum) ﬁeld theories, making the latter the subject of intense ongoing scrutiny. Recently, a number
of intriguing relationships have been discovered between ﬁeld theories whose physics is very diﬀer-
ent. One such correspondence is the double copy [1–3], that relates (non-abelian) gauge theories
and gravity. Although originally formulated for scattering amplitudes [2,4–34], it has subsequently
been extended to classical solutions [35–58], curved space [59–61] and double ﬁeld theory [58]. At
tree-level, the double copy has a string theoretic justiﬁcation [62]. More generally, it has a natural
representation in terms of the so-called CHY equations [63, 64], which themselves emerge from
ambitwistor string theory [65].
In all of the above contexts, an additional theory makes a crucial appearance, containing a single
scalar ﬁeld Φaa′ carrying two adjoint indices associated with a pair of (in principle distinct) Lie
groups. This biadjoint scalar ﬁeld theory can be described by the Lagrangian density

where fabc and ˜fa′b′c′ are the structure constants associated with the Lie groups, and we adopt the
summation convention for repeated indices. The above cubic Lagrangian leads to the quadratic
ﬁeld equation
∂µ∂µΦaa′ −yfabc ˜fa′b′c′Φbb′Φcc′ = 0.
(2)
Although the biadjoint theory is not a physical theory by itself, mounting evidence suggests that
its dynamical information is inherited, at least in part, by gauge and gravity theories. For example,
amplitudes in biadjoint scalar theory are related to those in (non-abelian) gauge theory by a process
known as the zeroth copy. A similar procedure holds for classical solutions, in those cases in which
the single copy between gravity and gauge theory is also known (see the above references for further
details). An ever-increasing web of theories related by similar correspondences is currently being
established, where a recent summary can be found in ﬁgure 1 of ref. [57].
The above correspondences involve perturbative solutions of the respective theories, and / or those
with only positive powers of the coupling constant. It is natural to ponder whether or not the
relationships can be extended to the fully nonperturbative regime. There are a number of ways
of approaching this issue. Firstly, one may consider how symmetries match up on both sides of
the double copy (see e.g. the recent ref. [66] for a discussion). Secondly, one may catalogue fully
non-linear solutions of various ﬁeld theories, before trying to match them up in some way. How
to do the latter is unclear, as all previous examples of how to perform the double copy involve
solutions of the linearised biadjoint equation. However, the elucidation of new nonlinear solutions
is certainly achievable, and a necessary step in probing nonperturbative aspects of the double copy
any further. A wide literature already exists on nonlinear solutions in gauge and gravity theories
(see e.g. refs. [67–69] for reviews). Much less is known about exact solutions of the biadjoint scalar
theory of eq. (2).
Some ﬁrst non-linear solutions of biadjoint theory were presented in ref. [70]. They included a
spherically symmetric monopole-like object in the case in which both Lie groups are the same,
where the ﬁeld Φaa′ has a power-law behaviour, diverging at the origin. An additional (and more
general) solution was found when the common gauge group is SU(2), although again possessing
spherical symmetry. Extended solutions were found in ref. [71], where the power-law behaviour of
the ﬁeld was dressed by a non-trivial form factor, which partially screens (but does not remove 4)
the singular behaviour at the origin.
The aim of this paper is to go beyond spherically symmetric solutions of the biadjoint ﬁeld equa-
tion. More speciﬁcally, we will consider cylindrically symmetric solutions, depending only on the
cylindrical polar radius ρ. A number of non-trivial results will be presented. First, we will ﬁnd a
power-law solution for the case in which both Lie groups are the same. This mirrors the monopole-
like solution found in ref. [70], and can be interpreted as a wiry object localised on the z-axis. We
will look for a more general solution when the common Lie group is SU(2), ﬁnding a one-parameter
family of solutions, again as in ref. [70] for the spherically symmetric case. Unlike the latter, how-
ever, we will see that the family of SU(2) solutions is degenerate in energy, which can be traced
to the symmetry of the biadjoint theory in this case. Next, we will consider dressed solutions, for
which the power-law behaviour in ρ is modiﬁed by a form factor. We will ﬁnd, as in ref. [71], that
such form factors can indeed be obtained, and have the eﬀect of screening the divergent behaviour

of the wire. Our results will be important for future studies of the nonperturbative double copy,
as well as being of interest in their own right, given the multiple contexts in which the biadjoint
theory arises.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we derive power-law line solutions for a
general common gauge group G, and for the case in which this group is SU(2). In section 3, we
consider dressed solutions. We discuss our results and conclude in section 4.

Power-law wire solutions
2.1
Solution for generic common gauge group
Let us ﬁrst consider a common gauge group G, such that fabc = ˜fabc in eqs. (1, 2). Adopting
cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ, z, φ), we may look for a static cylindrically symmetric solution by
making the ansatz
Φaa′ = δaa′f(ρ),
(3)
where the structure constants are normalised according to
fabcfa′bc = TAδaa′.

One then ﬁnds

+ yTAf2(ρ) = 0,
(5)
which has the non-trivial power-law solution
Φaa′ = −4δaa′
yTAρ2 .
(6)
As for the spherically symmetric monopole-like object found in ref. [70], this has an inverse power
of the coupling constant y, and thus is nonperturbative (i.e. it vanishes at weak coupling). It goes
like the inverse square of the cylindrical radius ρ, where this dependence can also be surmised by
dimensional analysis. The solution is singular as ρ →0, corresponding to a line defect in the ﬁeld,
localised on the z-axis. To further illustrate this, we may calculate the energy of the ﬁeld, for which
eq. (1) implies the Hamiltonian density (see ref. [70] for further details)

where N is the dimension of the common gauge group G. This diverges as ρ →0 due to the
singularity in the ﬁeld, but is well-behaved as ρ →∞. We can thus place a cutoﬀρ0 around the
wire, and calculate an energy per unit length

2.2
Solutions for SU(2)× SU(2)
For the special case in which the common gauge group G is SU(2), one may write a more general
form for the ﬁeld. The structure constants in that case are equal to the Levi-Cevita tensor fabc =
ϵabc, allowing the possibility of mixing spatial and gauge indices. This was used in refs. [70, 71]
to ﬁnd novel spherically symmetric solutions, and a similar (but not identical) ansatz can be used
here. A notable feature in the present case – which is shared by similar solutions in Yang-Mills
theory [73] – is that the requirement of cylindrical symmetry, together with the mixing of spatial
and gauge indices, means that choosing a special direction in space (the z-axis) picks out a special
direction (the 3-direction) in the gauge space, suggesting the following ansatz:
Φ33 = f1(ρ),
Φij = f2(ρ)δij + f3(ρ)xixj + f4(ρ)ϵ3ij,
Φ3i = Φi3 = 0.
(9)
Here and in the following, we use indices i, j, k . . . ∈(1, 2), as distinct from indices a, b, c ∈(1, 2, 3).
Substituting eq. (9) into eq. (2), one obtains the four coupled non-linear ordinary diﬀerential equa-

We may ﬁnd a power-law solution to eqs. (10) by writing
¯fi = kiραi,
(12)

α1 = α2 = α4 = −2,
α3 = −4,

There is thus a continuously inﬁnite family of solutions. Note that the previous solution of eq. (6)
emerges as the special case k = 1. As for that case, one may calculate the energy associated with

regardless of the value of k. Hence, the family of solutions obtained in eq. (15) is degenerate.
Furthermore, eq. (16) agrees with eq. (8) for the speciﬁc SU(2) values N = 3, TA = 2, as it should
given the degeneracy, and the fact that the previous solution emerges from the present one as a
special case.
One may understand the degeneracy of the family of solutions of eq. (15) as follows. First, we may
write k = cos θ, and introduce a matrix Φ, whose components are Φaa′:
Φ = −2






(17)
This is a rotation about the 3-axis in gauge space by angle θ. Next, we may write the Lagrangian
of eq. (1), for the special case of SU(2), as
L = 1
2∂µΦaa′∂µΦaa′ + y
3ϵabcϵa′b′c′Φaa′Φbb′Φcc′ = 1

+ 2 y det[Φ].
(18)
This is manifestly invariant under the transformation Φ →RT
1 ΦR2, for arbitrary rotation matrices
Ri. Thus, one may start with the solution of eq. (6) for SU(2), which in the present notation reads
Φ = −2




(19)
before acting on it with rotations about the 3-axis to generate the family of solutions of eq. (15).
The rotation will not change the energy, given the above-mentioned symmetry, which is none other
than the global symmetry associated with the SU(2) biadjoint theory 5.

Dressed wires
In the preceding section, we have found pure power-law wire solutions of the biadjoint theory. This
is not the whole story, however. In gauge theories, there is a cornucopia of solutions in which a
pure power-law divergence can be dressed with a non-trivial form factor, where the latter can be
interpreted as providing some internal structure (see e.g. refs. [67,68]). Furthermore, it can have
the eﬀect of screening the divergent behaviour near singular regions of the ﬁeld. Reference [71]
found that such solutions also exist in the biadjoint theory, namely that the spherically symmetric
monopole solution can be dressed with a screening function. Given that our aim is to catalogue -
both qualitatively and quantitatively - the solutions that are possible in biadjoint theory, it is both
interesting and useful to check whether or not such dressed behaviour is possible also for the wire
5A similar interpretation can be applied to the spherically symmetric SU(2)×SU(2) solution in ref. [70], which
consists of an inﬁnitesimal rotation of the analogue of eq. (6).

To this end, let us reconsider the ansatz of eq. (3), and deﬁne 6
J(ρ) = 2 + ρ2f(ρ).
(20)
Dimensional analysis ﬁxes f(ρ) ∼ρ−2, so that J(ρ) must be ﬁnite for all ρ. Substituting eq. (20)
into eq. (5) yields 7

dρ
+ J(ρ)2 −4 = 0.
(21)
Upon transforming to ξ via
ρ = e−ξ,
(22)
eq. (21) becomes an ODE with constant coeﬃcients:
d2J(ξ)
dξ2
+ 4dJ(ξ)
dξ
+ J2(ξ) −4 = 0.
(23)
This can be related to an Abel equation of the second kind, albeit one with no analytic solution (see
also ref. [71]). We may instead look for a numerical solution, as follows. One may write eq. (23) as
a set of coupled ﬁrst order equations by deﬁning
dJ
dξ , dψ
dξ


 ψ, 4 −4ψ −J2
.
(24)
Next, one may plot the integral curves of this vector ﬁeld in the (J, ψ) plane, where any bounded
curves correspond to solutions for J(ξ) that remain ﬁnite for all ξ (and thus ρ). We show this
vector ﬁeld in ﬁgure 1, whose examination yields the following solutions:
1. J(ξ) = −2: this corresponds to the solution of eq. (6).
2. J = 2: this yields the trivial solution Φaa′ = 0.
3. J(ξ) →±2 as ξ →±∞respectively. This is a non-trivial form factor, corresponding to the
curve that ﬂows from (−2, 0) to (2, 0) in ﬁgure 1.
It is worth remarking that the structure of ﬁgure 1 is qualitatively similar to that of the spherically
symmetric case of ref. [71], although the non-trivial form factor (in case 3) J(ξ) is diﬀerent. We
can solve for J(ξ) in the asymptotic limits ξ →±∞by writing
J(ξ) = ±2 + χ±(ξ),
ξ →±∞.
(25)
In each limit, we may neglect terms in χ2
±, obtaining approximate solutions (for ﬁnite J(ξ))

6Strictly speaking, the left-hand side of eq. (20) should be a function of a dimensionless ratio ρ/ρ0 for some length
scale ρ0, but we may take the latter to be unity without loss of generality in what follows.
7Varying the constant term on the right-hand side of eq. (20) would lead to an additional term linear in K, which
it is convenient to remove by the above choice.

at the origin. Finally, we note that it would also be possible to generate dressed solutions in the
SU(2)×SU(2) theory of section 2.2, by rotating the solution obtained here, as in eq. (17).

Conclusion
In this paper, we have obtained new solutions of the biadjoint scalar ﬁeld theory, which occurs in
a number of contexts, including the double copy relationship between gauge theories and gravity.
Although much is already known about the perturbative sector of biadjoint theory, much less is
known about its nonperturbative properties, making any results of interest in their own right. Fur-
thermore, solutions such as that found in this study open up the possibility to try to extend the
double copy to a fully nonperturbative regime.
We have focused speciﬁcally on cylindrically symmetric solutions, ﬁnding a power-law solution cor-
responding to a wire-like object localised on the z-axis, for the case in which both Lie groups in
the biadjoint theory are the same. For the case in which this common group is SU(2), an inﬁnite
family of solutions is possible. Such solutions are degenerate, an eﬀect which can be traced to the
global symmetry of the biadjoint theory for this choice of gauge group.
As well as pure power-law solutions, we also constructed dressed wires, in which a form factor
partially screens the divergent behaviour of the ﬁeld near the core. This is further evidence of a
potentially rich spectrum of nonperturbative solutions in biadjoint theory, whose properties mimic
those found in gauge theories. Whether or not the relationship with gauge theory can be made
precise is the subject of ongoing research, and we hope that the results of this investigation will
prove useful in this regard.
