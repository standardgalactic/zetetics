Acknowledgments
G. S. would like to thank Bettina Hoerlin for her patience
and support, Philip Nelson at the University of Pennsylvania
for discussions, and Diane Harper and Barbara Gilbert at
the Regenstein Library of the University of Chicago for their
assistance with the Fermi notes. We both would like to thank
Victoria Outerbridge for expert help transforming Fermi â€™s
hand-written notes into the images included in the book. In
addition, we both would like to thank Christie Henry, now at
Princeton University Press, for the initial enthusiasm about
the project, as well as Alan Thomas and Michaela Luckey
for continued editorial support at the University of Chicago
Press.
We would most particularly wish to thank Joseph
Calamia for his support and assistance in all matters, large
and small, leading to the completion of the book.
