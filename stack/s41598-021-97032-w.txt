Effects of order on memory 
of event times
Michelangelo Naim1, Mikhail Katkov1 & Misha Tsodyks1,2*
Memorizing time of an event may employ two processes (1) encoding of the absolute time of events 
within an episode, (2) encoding of its relative order. Here we study interaction between these two 
processes. We performed experiments in which one or several items were presented, after which 
participants were asked to report the time of occurrence of items. When a single item was presented, 
the distribution of reported times was quite wide. When two or three items were presented, the 
relative order among them strongly affected the reported time of each of them. Bayesian theory that 
takes into account the memory for the events order is compatible with the experimental data, in 
particular in terms of the effect of order on absolute time reports. Our results suggest that people do 
not deduce order from memorized time, instead people’s memory for absolute time of events relies 
critically on memorized order of the events.
Tulving1–3 proposed a distinction between semantic memory (general knowledge) and episodic memory (per-
sonal experiences that carry information about time and location). We know very little about how time is encoded 
in the brain, hence theoretical understanding of episodic memory is difficult. Our introspective experiences and 
psychological studies indicate that event time can be remembered either in the absolute form (when the event 
happened) or in the relative form (whether the event happened before or after other specific events)4. Absolute 
time processing is quite reliable for short intervals, such as when catching a ball or playing an instrument, but 
deteriorates when longer intervals are involved, to the extent that we are often unaware of when some events 
happened (for example, one may know that Robert Kennedy was assassinated later than his brother was, but 
may not know when this assassination happened). Most of psychological studies of time memory relate to event 
duration rather than their absolute occurrence time (see e.g.5,6).
In the current contribution, we consider the issue of interactions between absolute and relative time rep-
resentations in episodic memory. In particular, lower-level absolute event time is a continuous feature while 
higher-level relative time order between events is of a discrete nature, hence one could expect that as time goes 
by, the latter could be more reliably stored in memory and hence take precedence in inference process. Interac-
tions between absolute and relative attributes was indeed observed in recent studies of memory for simple visual 
­attributes7,8. In particular, reports of relative orientation of stimuli to reference strongly biased subsequent reports 
of absolute orientation of the ­stimulus7. ­In8, multiple stimuli were presented to observers who did not have to 
explicitly report their relative orientations, only the absolute orientation of each stimulus. Still, these reports 
were strongly biased by the relative orientations between the stimuli. Moreover, the orientation reports could be 
predicted quantitatively by retrospective Bayesian inference of absolute orientations if relative orientations were 
assumed to be treated by the brain as given, i.e. decoding followed reverse hierarchical scheme from complex 
to simple features, as opposed to direct hierarchy of encoding (see ­also9). These intriguing results raise some 
fundamental issues on the nature of information encoding and decoding in the brain at the time when stimuli 
that give rise to perception are withdrawn.
Here we study how generic the retrospective decoding in memory is and whether it can be extended to the 
domain of event times in episodic memory. To this end, we performed experiments where either single events or 
sequences of several events were presented to participants at different times, after which they had to report their 
time of appearance. ­Following8, we evaluated the interaction between absolute presentation time of each event 
and relative order between them. We observed very strong interference between these two types of information, 
such that reports of absolute time of an event were consistently shifted towards earlier or later times depending 
on the inferred order of that event relative to the other ones. We also developed Bayesian inference scheme for 
absolute time reports and compared it to our experimental observations.

Experimental design and results
Experimental design is illustrated in the Fig. 1. Initially, we wanted to establish the quality of absolute time encod-
ing of an event, when no other events were present during the same episode. Therefore, in the first experiment 
participants were exposed to a list of three items (words or images; see “Methods” section for more details). Each 
trial was divided into 11 time slots of duration 1.5 s each. The first and the last item were always presented in 
the first and last slot, respectively, to delineate the beginning and the end of the trial, while the second item was 
presented in a randomly chosen intermediate slot. Each item was shown for 1000 ms in the beginning of a slot. 
The experiment was performed using Amazon Mechanical Turk®. Participants were then requested to report 
the presentation time of one specific item, by moving a green circle with the mouse to the correct position on a 
sliding bar. At the beginning of each experiment, 5 training trials were performed where participants received 
a feedback with the correct timing (location of a circle) presented to them on another bar. Additional 15 trials 
without feedback were subsequently performed for data analysis. Results obtained in the first experiment are 
presented in Fig. 2 where reported time distributions for each presentation time of the intermediate item are 
shown. One can see that reported time distributions are rather wide, except for the very beginning, end and 
middle of a trial. Moreover, it is interesting that the results are very similar for both words and images.
To test the effect of event order on memory of “absolute” time, the second experiment with lists of four items 
was performed. Participants were requested to report the time of two of them, see Fig. 1.
Before analyzing Experiment 2, it is instructive to form a prediction for the accuracy of relative time order 
for two intermediate items based on the results of Experiment 1. If we assume that two intermediate items are 
encoded and reported independently, we can predict from Fig. 2 the probability that for any two presentation 
times the participants will make a mistake in ordering the items (see Figs. 3A and D). As expected, when the two 
presented items are close to each other, the predicted probability to flip the order is higher. However, experimental 
results do not show this tendency, with flip probability being rather uniform across all presentation conditions 
(see Fig. 3B and E). Overall, the accuracy of time ordering was 93% for words and 92% for images as opposed 
to 75% and 77% as predicted from the results of Experiment 1. The measured values are significantly different 
from predicted ones with p ≈10−90 and p ≈10−54 for words and images respectively (Fisher exact test). These 
results show that order of events in memory is not derived from independent estimates of timing for each of the 
events, suggesting that it is stored separately from them.
To probe the interactions between ordinal and absolute time representations in memory, we analyzed absolute 
time reports for the first and second items separately. Figure 4 shows the average reported time as a function of 
presented time for both first and second items (red an blue dashed lines, respectively). One can see a clear and 
Figure 1.   Experimental design. Upper panel: Experiment 1 scheme, three items presented. One item always 
presented at the beginning of the trial, one always at the end. The duration of a trial was divided into 11 slots of 
equal size. Intermediate stimulus was presented in a randomly chosen slot. After the presentation participants 
have to report the time of one of the items by moving a green cursor to the corresponding position on a sliding 
bar. Middle panel: Experiment 2 scheme, four items presented. One item is always presented at the beginning 
of the trial, another one at the end of the trial, while two intermediate items are presented in random time slots. 
After presentation participants have to report the time of two intermediate items by moving green cursors to 
the corresponding positions on two sliding bars. Vertical location of earlier and later items were random. Lower 
panel: Experiment 3 scheme, five items presented. One item is always presented at the beginning of the trial, 
another one at the end of the trial, while three intermediate items are presented in random time slots. After 
presentation participants have to report the time of three intermediate items by moving green cursors to the 
corresponding positions on three sliding bars. The correspondence between vertical location of a sliding bar and 
item was random.

significant effect of order on absolute time reports, with participants tending to report the first intermediate item 
earlier than the second item on the trials when they are presented at the same time slot. The difference between 
the average report times of the first and second items, for the same presentation time, is significant for all time 
slots, except last time slot for images where much fewer trials were collected. Indeed, comparing reported times 
for the first or second stimulus presented in different trials on the same temporal bin using t-test with unequal 
variance lead to p < 0.01 , p = 0.04 and p < 10−4 when words are presented on second, 9th and all the rest time 
slots respectively; p = 0.06 , p = 0.013 and p < 10−4 when images are presented on second, 9th and all the rest 
time slots respectively. Still the average report time depends on the presented time for both cases, indicating a 
complex interaction between the ordinal and absolute information in memory, which will be considered in more 
details in the next section. The corresponding report histograms are shown in Fig. S1.

To further evaluate the interactions between ordinal and absolute time representations in memory, we con-
ducted the experiment with three intermediate items (Experiment 3, see Fig. 1). In this case, the participants 
could either report the items in the correct order or make one of five possible ordering mistakes, see Fig. 5. Also 
in this case, the overall probability to report the correct ordering is still high: 77% (leftmost red column), which 
is significantly better than predicted from Experiment 1 assuming independent reports (leftmost blue column; 
37%, p ≈10−300 , exact Fisher test). This result is consistent with classical recall experiments showing that short 
lists of words can be well recalled in the correct order (see for ­example10). The effect of ordering on absolute time 
reports is even stronger for three items, for example a shift of reports for first and last intermediate items relative 
to their actual positions is bigger if there is another item presented between them (see Figs. 4, 6). In other words, 
the remembered time interval between past events is larger when other events intervene between them, which 
is consistent with previous ­work11. However the reported times still depend on the presented ones, albeit with 
a smaller slope than in the case of two items (Fig. 6, blue, red and green dashed lines for first, second and third 
item, respectively). In particular, if one considers a linear model for the reported position with presentation 
position as a factor and consider a null hypothesis that reported position does not depend on the presentation 
one, the null hypothesis can be rejected ( F(6703) = 3780 , p = 0 , F(4468) = 781 , p = 2 · 10−158 , F(2233) = 21.1 , 
p = 5 · 10−6 , for first, second and third words).

Bayesian theory
The results presented above indicate that absolute and relative times are two interactive but distinct aspects of 
episodic memory. We therefore developed a Bayesian time decoding theory that elaborates the precise nature 
of this interaction. Here we present the theory for the case of two items (see Methods for more details). Define 
t1 and t2 the absolute presentation times of events within a trial, and ˆt1 ( ˆt2 ) their internal representations at the 
report time. Define also σ = 1(0) if t1 < t2 ( t1 > t2) , respectively, to be the relative order between the events, 
and ˆσ its internal representation. A crucial assumption of our theory is that continuous representations ˆt1, ˆt2 
and discrete representation ˆσ are stored independently in memory and have their own representational errors, 
hence ˆσ is not necessarily consistent with ˆt1 and ˆt2.
The likelihood function for the internal variables is given by
where we assume that P1(ˆt|t) can be evaluated from the report time distribution measured in Experiment 1 (see 
Fig. 2) and
where δk,m is a Kronecker delta
and Pσ is the probability of a mistake in the internal representation of a relative order between events.
We assume that once all relevant features ( ˆt1 , ˆt2 and ˆσ ) are represented in working memory, at the report time 
the brain performs Bayesian inference of absolute presentation times according to
where N
 ˆt1, ˆt2, ˆσ

 is the normalization and we assumed that prior distribution of event times is uniform in 
agreement with the experimental protocol (see “Methods” section). One can see from Eqs. (2) and (3) that as the 
estimation of presentation order becomes more precise ( Pσ →0 ), it serves as an effective prior for the estimates 
of the absolute presentation times. ­Following8, we assume that reported times for the first and second items ( t1r 
and t2r , respectively) are generated as averages over the posterior distribution:

Since ˆt1, ˆt2, ˆσ are distributed according to the likelihood function of Eqs. (1) and (2), this equation gives rise 
to the distributions of reported times t1r, t2r for given presented times t1, t2 . To generate these distributions, 
we randomly sampled the reported times in Experiment 1 as a proxy for P1(ˆt|t) , and used Eq. (2) to generate 
samples of ˆσ . Using these samples, we formed the theoretical predictions for ordering mistakes probabilities 
(Fig. 3C and F) and average report time versus presentation time for both first and second item (Fig. 4A and B, 
overlaid with experimental results). The agreement between these predictions and the experimental results is 
rather good except for early and late positions (3rd position for the second stimulus and 9th position for the first 
stimulus). We speculate that when two intermediate stimuli are presented consecutively and immediately after 
the beginning of the trial (or before the end of it), participants form a separate memory for this sequence of three 
equally spaced stimuli and hence their reports are more reliable than what is predicted by the Bayesian model 
that does not include this mechanism. This effect disappears when we introduced a delay of 16 s between the end 
of presentation and reports (see Experiment 4 in “Methods”, and Figs. S6 and S7 for results). We also note that 
some of experimental report distributions exhibit bimodal shape that is not well captured by the model (Fig. S2).
The theoretical predictions for the Experiment 3 with three intermediate items were obtained as well and 
shown in Figs. 5 and 6 (see “Methods” section). Also in this case Bayesian theory captures well the experimental 
results, most importantly the strong effect of ordinal information on absolute time representations in memory. 
The distribution of reported times and comparison with Bayesian model are presented in Figs. S3 and S4. A 
closer look at the experimental report distributions (Fig. S3) reveals that they contain a significant component 
that does not depend on absolute presentation time but only on the ordinal position of the corresponding item. 
This suggests that in this experiment, some people completely disregard absolute presentation times and only 
retain the temporal order of different items, i.e. their memory representation of time is quantified. Indeed, when 
we simulated our Bayesian model with zero ordering error Pσ = 0 and uniform likelihood for absolute time 
P1(ˆt|t) = const [see Eq. (1)], the obtained report distributions match well this component of the experimental 
distributions (see Fig. S5). We speculate that transition between gradual and quantized time representations 
happens when participants reach their working memory capacity for continuous variables like absolute time.
The precise nature of memory encoding of ordinal information is not clear at this stage. One possibility could 
be that rather than forming the explicit representation of presentation order, participants actively rehearse the 
presented items using working memory and use that at the time of absolute time reports. We therefore performed 
an additional series of experiments with one or two intermediate items where participants had to perform 16 
s of math problems between the presentation of the items and time reports (Experiment 4). We reasoned that 
while performing calculations, participants would not be able to continuously rehearse the items. Nevertheless, 
we observed better-than-predicted precision of ordinal information in time reports in these experiments, as well 
as strong effects of order on absolute time reports (see Figs. S6 and S7), indicating genuine encoding of ordinal 
information in memory.
Discussion
In this contribution we showed that absolute time of different events is not reliably represented in memory, 
while presentation order is. Moreover, the ordinal information strongly effects absolute time reports by shifting 
reported times according to the presentation order, even though ordinal information itself did not have to be 
explicitly reported by the participants in our experiments. Experimental results can be reasonably approximated 
by the Bayesian inference framework. These results are  analogous to those ­of8 in the visual domain. We therefore 
believe that they reflect a general principle in memory decoding according to which those aspects of information 
that are more reliably represented in memory take precedence to less reliably represented aspects and moreover 
act as Bayesian priors for inferring the latter. In particular, it appears that higher-level features such as ordinal 
relations between elementary components of complex stimuli that are of a discrete nature are decoded first and 
then constrain the decoding of lower-level, continuous features such as absolute time of an event or an absolute 
orientation of a line. The generality of the observed effects, in particular when longer time intervals are involved, 
should be investigated in future experiments.
Methods
Participants, items and procedure. 
In total 1597 participants, were recruited to perform memory 
experiments on the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk® (https://​www.​mturk.​com). Ethics approval was 
obtained by the IRB (Institutional Review Board) of the Weizmann Institute of Science. All experiments were 
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Each participant accepted an informed con-
sent form before participation and was receiving 85 cents for approximately 10 min. For 1206 participants the 
presented lists were composed of non-repeating words randomly selected from a pool of 751 words produced 
by selecting English ­words12 and then maintaining only the words with a frequency per million greater than 
10, from ­Medler13. For 400 participants the presented lists were composed of non-repeating images (out of 149 
possible): visual stimuli consisted of animal ­pictures14, houses and body parts (free-copyrights Google images). 
Examples of the images are shown in Fig. 7. All the images were resized in browser to have width of 600 pixels. 
The items were presented on the standard Amazon Mechanical ­Turk® web page for Human Intelligent Task 
(HIT). Each trial was initiated by the participant by pressing “Start Experiment” button on computer screen. List 
presentation followed 300 ms of white frame. During a trial, depending on the task, 3 to 5 items where shown 
in a total time frame of 16.5 s. More specifically, the trial was divided into 11 slots of 1.5 s each, and an item 
was shown in one of the slots. The first item was always presented in the first slot, the last item was presented in 
the last slot. Intermediate items were shown in randomly chosen slots with uniform probability. Each item was 
shown within HIT frame with black font at onset of slot for 1000 ms followed by empty frame for 500 ms. After 
the last item, there was a 1000 ms delay before participant performed the task.

Experiment 1—One intermediate item. Participants were presented with three items. One item was always 
presented at the beginning of the trial, one always at the end and one in a random intermediate slot. At the 
end, participants were requested to report the time of one of the items moving a green circle with the mouse to 
the correct position on a sliding bar. At the beginning there were 5 training trials where participants received 
a feedback with the correct timing  followed by 15 trials without feedback. For 791 participants the items were 
words, for 400 the items were images.
Experiment 2—Two intermediate items. Participants were presented with four items. One item was always 
presented at the beginning of the trial, one always at the end and the two others in random intermediate slots. 
At the end, participants were requested to report the time of two of the items moving a green circles with the 
mouse to the correct position on two sliding bars. Sliding bars corresponding to two items were presented verti-
cally in randomized order. At the beginning there were 5 training trials where participants received a feedback 
with the correct timing, followed by 15 trials without feedback. For 222 participants the items were words, for 
198 the items were images.
Experiment 3—Three intermediate items. 451 participants were presented with five items. One item was always 
presented at the beginning of the trial, one always at the end and the three others in random intermediate slots. 
At the end, participants were requested to report the time of three of the items moving a green circles with the 
mouse to the correct position on three sliding bars. Sliding bars corresponding to three items were presented 
vertically in randomized order. At the beginning there were 5 training trials where participants received a feed-
back with the correct timing, followed by 15 trials without feedback.
Experiment 4—One and two intermediate items with longer delay. 99 participants were presented with three 
items and 156 with four items. One item was always presented at the beginning of the trial, one always at the 
end and the others in random intermediate slots. At the end, participants had to perform 16 s of mathematical 
problem solving task and after that were requested to report the time of one or two of the items moving green 
circles with the mouse to the correct position on the sliding bars. Sliding bars were presented vertically in ran-
domized order. At the beginning there were 5 training trials where participants received a feedback with the 
correct timing, followed by 15 trials without feedback.
Participants selection. 
Examining the performance of each participant we encountered that many par-
ticipants did not perform the task. For instance, since there are 6 possible orderings of items in Experiment 3, 
the chance to obtain correct order with random responses 1
6 , and since each participants performed 15 trials 
the expected number of correct trials from random responses is 2.5. In Experiment 2 there are only 2 order-
ings and the expected number of correct orderings from random responses is 7.5. As shown in Fig. 8, there is 
a bimodal distribution of the number of correct orderings in Experiment 3, with one mode around the chance 
performance. Therefore, we decided to exclude participants that had 6 or less correct orderings in Experiment 
3 and less than 10 correct orderings in Experiment 2. After exclusion, we analyzed data for 190 participants in 
Experiment 2 with words, 181 with images, 256 in Experiment 3 and 173 in Experiment 4.
For Bayesian analysis:
•	 out of 791 participants that performed Experiment 1 with words, we used data only from the 190 participants 
that performed also Experiment 2.

•	 out of 400 participants that performed Experiment 1 with images, we used data only from the 181 participants 
that performed also Experiment 2.
•	 in Experiment 3, instead, a new pool of participants was used. Among them, only 34 previously completed 
Experiment 1. Therefore we considered all the 791 participants for the analysis.

Bayesian inference with arbitrary number of presented items
To generalize the Bayesian equation for the case of n items in memory, we introduce a variable σ that denotes 
the ordering of their presentation times t1, . . . , tn (i.e. σ = (123) if t1 < t2 < t3 etc). We then write the likelihood 
function in the following form:
where we again assume that Pi
ˆt|t

 can be evaluated from the report time distribution measured in Experiment 
1 (see Fig. 2). For different ordering likelihood functions, P

ˆσ|t1, . . . , tn

 , we assume for simplicity that
i.e. we assume that each ordering mistake in memory happens with equal probability. The rest of the calculations 
can then proceed as in n = 2 case presented in the paper. The value of Pσ for simulating experiments 2 and 3 was 
chosen as 0.08 and 0.1, respectively. These values give rough correspondence between simulated and experimental 
reported positions and ordering errors.
