Light is an electromagnetic wave 
An electromagnetic wave is a traveling wave that has time-varying electric and magnetic  
fields that are perpendicular to each other and the direction of propagation z.

Ex = Eo cos(tkz + )  
Ex = Electric field along x at position z at time t 
k =  Propagation constant = 2/ 
 =  Wavelength 
 =  Angular frequency = 2u(u=frequency) 
Eo = Amplitude of the wave 
 = Phase constant; at t = 0 and z = 0, Ex may or may not 
necessarily be zero depending on the choice of origin.  
 
(tkz + ) =  = Phase of the wave  
 
This is a monochromatic plane wave of infinite extent 
traveling in the positive z direction.

Wavefront 
 
A surface over which the phase of a wave is constant is 
referred to as a wavefront 
 
A wavefront of a plane wave is a plane perpendicular to the 
direction of propagation 
 
The interaction of a light wave with a nonconducting medium 
(conductivity = 0) uses the electric field component Ex rather 
than By. 
 
Optical field refers to the electric field Ex.

A plane EM wave traveling along z, has the same Ex (or By) at any point in a given xy plane. 
All electric field vectors in a given xy plane are therefore in phase. The xy planes are of  
infinite extent in the x and y directions.

The time and space evolution of a given phase , for example 
that corresponding to a maximum field is described by 
 
 
 
 = tkz +  = constant 
 
During a time interval t, this constant phase (and hence the 
maximum field) moves a distance z. The phase velocity of this 
wave is therefore z/t. The phase velocity v is

The phase difference between two points separated 
by z is simply kz 
since t is the same for each point 
 
If this phase difference is 0 or multiples of 2 then 
the two points are in phase. Thus, the phase 
difference  can be expressed as kz or 2z/ 
 
 
Phase change over a distance z 
 = tkz +  
 
 
 
 = kz

Recall that  
 
 
cos= Re[exp(j)] 
  
where Re refers to the real part. We then need to take the real 
part of any complex result at the end of calculations. Thus, 
 
  
 
Ex(z,t) = Re[Eoexp(j)expj(tkz)] 
 or 
 
 
 
 
Ex(z,t) = Re[Ecexpj(tkz)] 
 
where Ec = Eoexp(jo) is a complex number that represents the 
amplitude of the wave and includes the constant phase 
information o.

Direction of propagation is indicated with a vector k, called the 
wave vector, whose magnitude is the propagation constant, k 
= 2/. k is perpendicular to constant phase planes. 
 
When the electromagnetic (EM) wave is propagating along 
some arbitrary direction k, then the electric field E(r,t) at a 
point r on a plane perpendicular to k is 
 
 
 
 
E (r,t) = Eocos(tkr + ) 
 
If propagation is along z, kr becomes kz. In general, if k has 
components kx, ky and kz along x, y and z, then from the 
definition of the dot product, kr = kxx + kyy + kzz.

In optics and 
especially laser science, 
the Rayleigh 
length or Rayleigh 
range is the distance 
along the propagation 
direction of a beam from 
the waist to the place 
where the area of 
the cross section is 
doubled.[1] A related 
parameter is 
the confocal 
parameter, b, which is 
twice the Rayleigh 
length.

Refractive Index  
When an EM wave is traveling in a dielectric 
medium, the oscillating electric field polarizes the 
molecules of the medium at the frequency of the 
wave 
 
The stronger is the interaction between the field and 
the dipoles, the slower is the propagation of the 
wave

When two perfectly harmonic waves of frequencies  
and  +  and wavevectors kk and k + k interfere, they 
generate a wave packet which contains an oscillating field at 
the mean frequency  that is amplitude modulated by a 
slowly varying field of frequency . The maximum 
amplitude moves with a wavevector k and thus with a group 
velocity that is given by 
vg = d

Group Velocity 
Consider two sinusoidal waves that are close in frequency, 
that is, they have frequencies  and  + . Their 
wavevectors will be kk and k + k. The resultant wave is 
 
Ex(z,t) = Eocos[()t(kk)z]  
 
 
 
+ Eocos[( + )t(k + k)z] 
 
By using the trigonometric identity  
cosA + cosB = 2cos[1/2(AB)]cos[1/2(A + B)]  
we arrive at 
 
Ex(z,t) = 2Eocos[()t(k)z][cos(tkz)]

This represents a sinusoidal wave of frequency  . This is 
amplitude modulated by a very slowly varying sinusoidal of 
frequency . This system of waves, i.e. the modulation, 
travels along z at a speed determined by the modulating 
term, cos[()t(k)z]. The maximum in the field occurs 
when [()t(k)z] = 2m = constant (m is an integer), 
which travels with a velocity

This is the group velocity of the waves because it determines the

The instantaneous irradiance can only be measured if the 
power meter can respond more quickly than the oscillations 
of the electric field. Since this is in the optical frequencies 
range, all practical measurements yield the average 
irradiance because all detectors have a response rate much 
slower than the frequency of the wave.

We can use constructive interference to show that there can 
only be one reflected wave which occurs at an angle equal to 
the incidence angle. The two waves along Ai and Bi are in 
phase.  
 
When these waves are reflected to become waves Ar and Br 
then they must still be in phase, otherwise they will interfere 
destructively and destroy each other. The only way the two 
waves can stay in phase is if qr = qi. All other angles lead to 
the waves Ar and Br being out of phase and interfering 
destructively.

Unless the two waves at A and B still have the same phase, there 
will be no transmitted wave. A and B points on the front are only 
in phase for one particular transmitted angle, qt. 
 
It takes time t for the phase at B on wave Bi to reach B 
BB = v1t = ct/n1   
 
During this time t, the phase A has progressed to A 
AA = v2t = ct/n2  
 
A and B belong to the same front just like A and B so that AB is 
perpendicular to ki in medium 1 and AB is perpendicular to kt in 
medium 2. From geometrical considerations,  
 
AB = BB/sinqi and AB = AA/sinqt so that

When the incidence angle qi exceeds qc then there is no 
transmitted wave but only a reflected wave. The latter 
phenomenon is called total internal reflection (TIR). TIR 
phenomenon that leads to the propagation of waves in a 
dielectric medium surrounded by a medium of smaller 
refractive index as in optical waveguides, e.g. optical fibers.  
 
Although Snell's law for qi > qc shows that sinqt > 1 and hence 
qt is an "imaginary" angle of refraction, there is however an 
attenuated wave called the evanescent wave.

A small hole is made in a plastic bottle full of water to generate a water jet. When the hole is illuminated with a laser 
beam (from a green laser pointer), the light is guided by total internal reflections along the jet to the tray. The light 
guiding by a water jet was first demonstrated by Jean-Daniel Colladan, a Swiss scientist (Water with air bubbles was 
used to increase the visibility of light. Air bubbles scatter light.) [Left: Copyright: S.O. Kasap, 2005][Right: Comptes

Using the above boundary conditions for the fields at y = 0, 
and the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields, 
we can find the reflected and transmitted waves in terms of 
the incident wave.  
 
The boundary conditions can only be satisfied if the

from medium 1 to 2, the amplitudes of the reflected and 
transmitted waves can be readily obtained in terms of n1, n2 
and the incidence angle qi alone. These relationships are 
called Fresnel's equations. If we define n = n2/n1, as the 
relative refractive index of medium 2 to that of 1, then the

In linearly polarized light, however, the field oscillations are 
contained within a well defined plane. Light emitted from 
many light sources such as a tungsten light bulb or an LED 
diode is unpolarized and the field is randomly oriented in a 
direction that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. 
 
At the critical angle and beyond (past 44° in the figure), i.e. 
when qi  qc, the magnitudes of both r// and rgo to unity so 
that the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident 
wave. The incident wave has suffered total internal 
reflection, TIR.

In internal reflection (n1 > n2), the amplitude of the 
reflected wave from TIR is equal to the amplitude of 
the incident wave but its phase has shifted. 
 
What happens to the transmitted wave when qi > qc?  
 
According to the boundary conditions, there must still 
be an electric field in medium 2, otherwise, the 
boundary conditions cannot be satisfied. When qi > 
qc, the field in medium 2 is attenuated (decreases 
with y, and is called the evanescent wave.

When medium  B is thin (thickness d  is small), the field penetrates from 
the AB interface into medium B and reaches BC interface, and gives rise to 
a transmitted wave in medium C.  The effect is the tunneling of the 
incident beam in A through B to C. The maximum field Emax of the 
evanescent wave in B decays in B along y and but is finite at the BC 
boundary and excites the transmitted wave.

Light approaches the boundary from the lower index side,  
 
 
 
n1 < n2 
This is external reflection.  
Light becomes reflected by the surface of an optically denser 
(higher refractive index) medium. 
 
r and r// depend on the incidence angle qi. At normal 
incidence, r and r// are negative. In external reflection at 
normal incidence there is a phase shift of 180°. r// goes 
through zero at the Brewster angle, qp. At qp, the reflected 
wave is polarized in the E component only.  
 
Transmitted light in both internal reflection (when qi < qc) and 
external reflection does not experience a phase shift.

Since a glass medium has a refractive index of 
around 1.5 this means that typically 4% of the 
incident radiation on an air-glass surface will be 
reflected back.

Example: Reflection at normal incidence. Internal 
and external reflection 
Consider the reflection of light at normal incidence on a boundary 
between a glass medium of refractive index 1.5 and air of 
refractive index 1.  
 
(a) If light is traveling from air to glass, what is the reflection 
coefficient and the intensity of  the reflected light with respect to 
that of the  incident light? 
 
(b) If light is traveling from glass to air, what is  the reflection 
coefficient and the intensity of  the reflected light with respect to 
that of the incident light? 
 
(c) What is the polarization angle in the external reflection in a 
above? How would you make a polaroid from this?

Solution 
(a) The light travels in air and becomes partially reflected 
at the surface of the glass which  corresponds to external 
reflection. Thus n1 = 1 and n2 = 1.5. Then,  
 
r// = r= n1 n2
n1 n2
= 11.5
11.5 = 0.2
This is negative which means that there is a 180° phase 
shift. The reflectance (R), which gives the fractional 
reflected power, is 
 
 
R = r//
2 = 0.04 or 4%.

(b)  The light travels in glass and becomes partially 
reflected at the glass-air interface which corresponds to 
internal reflection. n1 = 1.5 and n2 = 1. Then, 
r// = r= n1 n2
n1 n2
= 1.5 1
1.5 1 = 0.2
There is no phase shift. The reflectance is again 0.04 or 
4%. In both cases (a)  and (b) the amount of reflected 
light is the same.

Transmittance T relates the intensity of the transmitted wave 
to that of the incident wave in a similar fashion to the 
reflectance.  
 
However the transmitted wave is in a different medium and 
further its direction with respect to the boundary is also 
different due to refraction.  
 
For normal incidence, the incident and transmitted beams are 
normal so that the equations are simple:

Reflection and Transmission – An Example 
Question  A light beam traveling in air is incident on a glass plate of refractive index 
1.50 . What is the Brester or polarization angle? What are the relative intensities of 
the reflected and transmitted light for the polarization perpendicular and parallel to 
the plane of incidence at the Brestwer angle of incidence? 
Solution  Light is traveling in air and is incident on the glass surface at the polarization 
angle qp. Here n1 = 1, n2 = 1.5 and tanqp = (n2/n1) = 1.5 so that qp = 56.31°. We now have 
to use Fresnel's equations to find the reflected and transmitted amplitudes. For the 
perpendicular polarization 
 
 
 
 
On the other hand,  r// = 0.  The reflectances R = | r|2 = 0.148 and R// = |r//|2 = 0 so that R 
= 0.074, and has no parallel polarization in the plane of incidence. Notice the negative sign 
in r, which indicates a phase change of .

Clearly, light with polarization parallel to the plane of incidence has greater intensity.  
 
If we were to reflect light from a glass plate, keeping the angle of incidence at 56.3°, then 
the reflected light will be polarized with an electric field component perpendicular to the 
plane of incidence. The transmitted light will have the field greater in the plane of incidence, 
that is, it will be partially polarized. By using a stack of glass plates one can increase the 
polarization of the transmitted light. (This type of pile-of-plates polarizer was invented by 
Dominique F.J. Arago in 1812.) 
To find the transmittance for each polarization, we need the refraction angle qt.  From 
Snell's law, n1sinqi = ntsinqt i.e. (1)sin(56.31) = (1.5)sinqt, we find qt = 33.69.

Example: Reflection of light from a less dense 
medium (internal reflection) 
A ray of light which is traveling in a glass medium of 
refractive index n1 = 1.460 becomes incident on a less dense 
glass medium of refractive index n2 = 1.440. The free space 
wavelength () of the light ray is 1300 nm.

Solution 
 
(a) 
The critical angle qc for TIR is given by 
  
 
sinqc = n2/n1 = 1.440/1.460 so that qc = 80.51° 
 
 
(b) 
Since the incidence angle qi > qc there is a

Example: Antireflection coatings on solar cells 
 
When light is incident on the surface of a semiconductor it 
becomes partially reflected. Partial reflection is an important 
energy loss in solar cells.  
 
The refractive index of Si is about 3.5 at wavelengths around 
700 - 800 nm. Reflectance with n1(air) = 1 and n2(Si)  3.5 is

30% of the light is reflected and is not available for 
conversion to electrical energy; a considerable reduction in 
the efficiency of the solar cell.

Light is first incident on the air/coating surface. Some of it 
becomes reflected as A in the figure. Wave A has experienced 
a 180° phase change on reflection because this is an external 
reflection. The wave that enters and travels in the coating then 
becomes reflected at the coating/semiconductor surface.  
We can coat the surface of the 
semiconductor device with a thin 
layer of a dielectric material, e.g. 
Si3N4 (silicon nitride) that has an 
intermediate refractive index.  
n1(air) = 1, n2(coating)  1.9 and n3(Si) = 3.5

Since c =  /n2, where  is the free-space wavelength, the phase difference 
 between A and B is (2n2/)(2d). To reduce the reflected light, A and B 
must interfere destructively. This requires the phase difference to be  or 
odd-multiples of , m where m = 1,3,5, is an odd-integer. Thus

This reflected wave B, also suffers a

When B reaches A, it has suffered a 
total delay of traversing the thickness d 
of the coating twice. The phase 
difference is equivalent to kc(2d) 
where kc = 2/c is the propagation 
constant in the coating, i.e. kc =2/c 
where c is the wavelength in the 
coating.

To obtain good destructive interference between waves A and 
B, the two amplitudes must be comparable. We need (proved 
later) n2 = (n1n3). When n2 = (n1n3) then the reflection 
coefficient between the air and coating is equal to that 
between the coating and the semiconductor. For a Si solar 
cell, (3.5) or 1.87. Thus, Si3N4 is a good choice as an 
antireflection coating material on Si solar cells.

A dielectric mirror has a stack of dielectric layers of alternating 
refractive indices. Let n1 (= nH) > n2 (= nL) 
 
Layer thickness d = Quarter of wavelength or layer  
layer = o/n; o is the free space wavelength at which the mirror is 
required to reflect the incident light, n = refractive index of layer.  
 
Reflected waves from the interfaces interfere constructively and 
give rise to a substantial reflected light. If there are sufficient 
number of layers, the reflectance can approach unity at o.

r12 for light in layer 1 being reflected at the 1-2 boundary is  
r12 = (n1n2)/(n1 + n2) and is a positive number indicating no phase change.  
r21 for light in layer 2 being reflected at the 2-1 boundary is  
r21 = (n2n1)/(n2 + n1) which is –r12 (negative) indicating a  phase change. 
The reflection coefficient alternates in sign through the mirror 
The phase difference between A and B is  
 
0 +  + 2k1d1 = 0 +  + 2(2n1/o)(o/4n1)= 2.  
 
Thus, waves A and B are in phase and interfere constructively.

semiconductor lasers.

Example: Dielectric Mirror 
A dielectric mirror has quarter wave layers consisting of Ta2O5 with nH =  1.78 and SiO2 with 
nL = 1.55 both at  850 nm, the central wavelength at which the mirror reflects light. The 
substrate is Pyrex glass with an index ns = 1.47  and the outside medium is air with n0 = 1. 
Calculate the maximum reflectance  of the mirror when the number N of double layers is 4 
and 12. What would happen if you use TiO2 with nH = 2.49, instead of Ta2O5? Consider the N 
= 12 mirror. What is the bandwidth and what happens to the reflectance if you interchange 
the high and low index layers? Suppose we use a Si wafer as the substrate, what happens to 
the maximum reflectance?

Now use TiO2 for the high-n layer with n1 = nH = 2.49,  
R4 = 94.0% and R12 = 100% (to two decimal places).  
 
The refractive index contrast is important. For the TiO2-SiO2 stack we 
only need 4 double layers to get roughly the same reflectance as from 
12 pairs of layers of Ta2O5-SiO2. If we interchange nH and nL in the 
12-pair stack, i.e. n1 = nL and n2 = nH, the Ta2O5-SiO2 reflectance falls 
to 80.8% but the TiO2-SiO2 stack is unaffected since it is already 
reflecting nearly all the light.

Example: Complex Refractive Index for CdTe 
Calculate the absorption coefficient  and the reflectance R of CdTe at 
the Reststrahlen peak, and also at 50 m. What is your conclusion? 
Solution: At the Reststrahlen peak,   70 m, K  6, and n  4. 
The free-space propagation constant is 
 
 
 
 
ko = 2/ = 2/(70106 m) = 9.0104 m1  
 
The absorption coefficient  is 2k, 
 
 
 
 
 = 2k = 2koK = 2(9.0104 m1)(6) = 1.08106 m1 
 
which corresponds to an absorption depth 1/ of about 0.93 micron.

Diffraction 
A light  beam incident on a small circular aperture becomes diffracted and its light intensity pattern 
after passing through the aperture is a diffraction pattern with circular bright rings (called Airy rings). 
If the screen is far away from the aperture, this would be a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern. (Diffraction

Diffraction 
Huygens-Fresnel principle 
Every unobstructed point of a wavefront, at a given 
instant in time, serves as a source of spherical 
secondary waves (with the same frequency as that of 
the primary wave). The amplitude of the optical field at 
any point beyond is the superposition of all these 
wavelets (considering their amplitudes and relative 
phases)

Diffraction 
(a) Huygens-Fresnel principle states that each point in the aperture becomes a source of 
secondary waves (spherical waves). The spherical wavefronts are separated by . The new 
wavefront is the envelope of the all these spherical wavefronts. (b) Another possible 
wavefront occurs at an angle q to the z-direction which is a diffracted wave.

(a) The aperture has a finite width a along y, but it is very long along x so that it is a one-dimensional 
slit. The aperture is divided into N number of point sources each occupying y with amplitude 
proportional to y since the slit is excited by a plane electromagnetic wave. (b) The intensity 
distribution in the received light at the screen far away from the aperture: the diffraction pattern. 
Note that the slit is very long along x and there is no diffraction along this dimension. (c) Diffraction 
patter obtained by using a laser beam from a pointer incident on a single slit.

Rayleigh Criterion 
Resolution of imaging systems is limited by diffraction effects. As points S1 and S2 get 
closer, eventually the Airy patterns overlap so much that the resolution is lost. The 
Rayleigh criterion allows the minimum angular separation two of the point sources be 
determined. (Schematic illustration inasmuch as the side lobes are actually much smaller

(a) Ruled periodic parallel scratches on a glass serve as a transmission grating. (The glass 
plate is assumed to be very thin.) (b) A reflection grating. An incident light beam results in 
various "diffracted" beams. The zero-order diffracted beam is the normal reflected beam 
with an angle of reflection equal to the angle of incidence.

(a) A blazed grating. Triangular grooves have been cut into the surface with a periodicity 
d. The side of a triangular groove make an angle  to the plane of the diffraction angle. 
For normal incidence, the angle of diffraction must be 2 to place the specular reflection 
on the diffracted beam. (b) When the incident beam is not normal, the specular 
reflection will coincides with the diffracted beam, when ( + qi) +  = qm

Example: A reflection grating 
Consider a reflection grating with a 
period d that is 10 m. Find the 
diffracted beams if a collimated light 
wave of wavelength 1550 nm is incident 
on the grating at an angle of 45 to its 
normal. What should be the blazing 
angle  if we were to use the blazed 
grating with the same periodicity? What 
happens to the diffracted beams if the 
periodicity is reduced to 2 m? 
Solution: Put, m = 0 to find the zero-order diffraction, q0  = 45, as expected. 
The general Bragg diffraction condition is 
d(sinqm  sinqi) = m. 
 (10 m)(sinqm  sin(45) = (+1)(1.55 m)  
 (10 m)(sinqm  sin(45) = (1)(1.55 m) 
Solving these two equations, we find  
qm = 59.6 for m = 1 and qm = 33.5 for m = 1

Example: A reflection grating 
The secular reflection from the grooved surface 
coincides with the mth order diffraction when  
 
 
2 = qm qi  
 

 = (1/2)(qm qi) = (1/2)(59.6 – 45) = 7.3  
 
 Suppose that we reduce d to 2 m 
Recalculating the above we find  
qm = 3.9 for m = 1  
and imaginary for m = +1.  
 
Further, for m = 2, there is a second order 
diffraction beam at qm = 57.4.  
 
If we increase the angle of incidence, for 
example, qi = 85 on the first grating, the 
diffraction angle for m = 1 increases from 33.5  
to 57.2 and the other diffraction peak (m = 1) 
disappears

Example on Wavelength Separation 
qi = 45.  Periodicity = d = 3 m 
 
d(sinqm  sinqi) = m. 
d = 3 m,  = 1.550 m, qi = 45, and calculate the diffraction angle qm for m = 1 
 
(3 m)[sinq1  sin(45)] = (1)(1.550 m)  

q1 = 10.978  
A = 1.540m, examining the same order, m = 1, we find q1 = 11.173 

q1 = 11.17310.978  = 0.20 
Note, m = 1 gives a complex angle and should be neglected.

Rayleigh Scattering 
(a) Rayleigh scattering involves the polarization of a small dielectric particle or a region 
that is much smaller than the light wavelength.  The field forces dipole oscillations in the 
particle (by polarizing it) which leads to the emission of EM waves in "many" directions 
so that a portion of the light energy is directed away from the incident beam. (b) A polar 
plot of the dependence of the intensity of the scattered light on the angular direction q with 
respect to the direction of propagation, x in Rayleigh scattering. (In a polar plot, the radial 
distance OP is the intensity.)

Rayleigh Scattering 
I = Ioexp(aRz) 
When a light beam propagates through a medium in which there are small particles, 
it becomes scattered as it propagates and losses power in the direction of 
propagation. The light becomes attenuated.

Rayleigh attenuation coefficient 
Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt) was an English physicist (1877–1919) and a 
Nobel Laureate (1904) who made a number of contributions to wave physics of 
sound and optics. He formulated the theory of scattering of light by small particles 
and the dependence of scattering on 1/4 circa 1871. Then, in a paper in 1899 he 
provided a clear explanation on why the sky is blue. Ludvig Lorentz, around the 
same time, and independently, also formulated the scattering of waves from a small 
dielectric particle, though it was published in Danish (1890).40 (© Mary Evans 
Picture Library/Alamy.)

Photonic Crystals 
Photonic crystals in (a) 1D, (b) 2D and (c) 3D, D being the dimension. Grey 
and white regions have different refractive indices and may not necessarily be 
the same size. L is the periodicity. The 1D photonic crystal in (a) is the well-
known Bragg reflector, a dielectric stack.

An SEM image of a 3D photonic crystal that is based 
on the wood pile structure. The rods are polycrystalline 
silicon. Although 5 layers are shown, the unit cell has 
4 layers e.g., the fours layers starting from the bottom 
layer. Typical dimensions are in microns. In one 
similar structure with rod-to-rod pitch d = 0.65 m 
with only a few layers, the Sandia researchers were 
able to produce a photonic bandgap of 0.8 m centered 
around 1.6 m within the telecommunications band.

Photonic Crystals 
Eli Yablonovitch (left) at the University of California 
at Berkeley,  and Sajeev John (below) at the 
University of Toronto, carried out the initial 
pioneering work on photonic crystals.  Eli 
Yablonovitch has suggested that the name "photonic 
crystal" should apply to 2D and 3D periodic 
structures with a large dielectric (refractive index) 
difference. (E. Yablonovitch, "Photonic crystals: 
what's in a name?", Opt. Photon. News, 18, 12, 
2007.) Their original papers were published in the 
same volume of Physical Review Letters in 1987. 
According to Eli Yablonovitch, "Photonic Crystals are

Sajeev John (left), at the University of Toronto, 
along with Eli Yablonovitch (above) carried out 
the initial pioneering work in the development of 
the field of  photonics crystals. Sajeev John was 
able to show that it is possible to trap light in a 
similar way the electron is captured, that is 
localized,  by a trap in a semiconductor. Defects 
in photonic crystals can confine or localize 
electromagnetic waves; such effects have 
important applications in quantum computing 
and integrated photonics. (Courtesy of Sajeev

The photonic bandgaps along x, y and z overlap for all polarizations of the field, which results in a 
full photonic bandgap . (An intuitive illustration.) (b) The unit cell of a woodpile photonic 
crystal. There are 4 layers, labeled 1-4 in the figure, with each later having parallel "rods". The 
layers are at right angles to each other. Notice that layer 3 is shifted with respect to 1, and 4 with 
respect to 2.   (c) An SEM image of a 3D photonic crystal that is based on the wood pile structure.

Photonic Crystals for Light Manipulation 
Schematic illustration of point and line defects in a photonic crystal. A point defect acts 
as an optical cavity, trapping the radiation. Line defects allow the light to propagate 
along the defect line. The light is prevented from dispersing into the bulk of the crystal 
since the structure has a full photonic bandgap. The frequency of the propagating light is 
in the bandgap, that is in the stop-band.

Fermat's principle of least time   
 
Fermat's principle of least time in simple terms states that when light travels from one point 
to another it takes a path that has the shortest time.  In going from a point A in some 
medium with a refractive index n1 to a point B in a neighboring medium with refractive 
index n2, the light path is AOB that involves refraction at O and satisfies Snell's law. The 
time it takes to travel from A to B is minimum only for the path AOB such that the 
incidence and refraction angles qi and qt satisfy Snell's law.  
Consider a light wave 
traveling from point A 
(x1, y2) to B (x1, y2) 
through an arbitrary 
point O at a distance x 
from O. The principle of 
least time from A to B 
requires that O is such 
that the incidence and 
refraction angles obey 
Snell's law.

When light travels from one point to another it takes a 
path that has the shortest time.  
Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) was a French 
mathematician who made many significant 
contributions to modern calculus, number 
theory, analytical geometry, and probability.

Fermat's principle of least time   
 
Let's draw a straight line from A to B cutting the x-axes at O. The line AOB will be our 
reference line and we will place the origin of x and y coordinates at O. Without invoking 
Snell's law, we will vary point O along the x-axis (hence OO is a variable labeled x), until 
the time it takes to travel AOB is minimum, and thereby derive Snell's law. The time t it 
takes for light to travel from A to B through O is
