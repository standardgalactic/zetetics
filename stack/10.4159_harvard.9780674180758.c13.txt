An Ising Model with Random Impurities : Specific Heat 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 1 
We now turn to a most interesting practical question raised at the end 
of Chapter II, namely, how can we generalize statistical mechanics to 
deal with the experimental situation in which we do not completely know 
the interaction energy of the system, owing to the presence of impurities? 
This type of statistical mechanics is not nearly as well developed as the 
familiar statistical mechanics presented in Chapter II. We will therefore 
not even give the pretense of generality but confine ourselves very closely 
to the Ising model. In this way we hope to provide a concrete guide for 
future studies of the properties of impure and amorphous materials. 
As discussed in Chapter II, the term impurity refers not only to the 
presence of foreign material in a sample but to any physical property 
that makes lattice sites different from one another. One such property 
is a defect or vacancy in the lattice. Another is the presence in the sample 
of different isotopes; for example, nickel contains roughly 68 percent 
of Ni68, 26 percent of Ni60, 1 percent of Ni", 4 percent of Ni82, and 
1 percent of Ni64. The distribution of these impurities is governed by 
spin-independent forces which have been neglected in our discussion. 
We can distinguish at least two different situations: 
(1) As the temperature changes, the distribution of impurities may 
change; such a situation will occur, for example, near the melting point 
of a lattice. 
(2) The distribution of impurities may be independent of temperature, 
at least on the time scale of laboratory measurements; such a situation 
1. This chapter is based on the work of Β. M. McCoy and T. T. Wu, Phys. Rev. 
176, 631 (1968), Phy. Rev. Letters 21, 549 (1968).

will obtain when the temperature of a lattice is well below the melting 
temperature. Impurities of this sort are said to be "frozen in," and in 
this book we will consider "frozen in" impurities exclusively. 
If these "frozen in " impurities distribute themselves through the system 
in a periodic fashion, then, though the symmetry of the lattice would be 
reduced, it would not be destroyed. With sufficient labor, such an ordered 
sort of impurity can be studied in the Ising model by means of the 
techniques we have presented. However, such an ordering of impurities 
does not usually take place. Therefore, if we want to study realistically 
the effects of impurities in magnetic systems, we have to allow the 
impurities to be distributed at random throughout the lattice. The 
regularity of the system now has been not merely reduced but totally 
destroyed. A phase transition is a cooperative phenomenon in which the 
entire system takes part. It is therefore not at all obvious that the trans-
lationally invariant Onsager lattice should possess a phase-transition 
behavior that is in any way related to such an impure system. 
The most realistic way in which we could introduce impurities into the 
Ising model would be to replace some host spins, which interact with 
themselves with interaction energies E1 and E2, by impurity spins, which 
interact with the host spins with interaction energies E[ and E'2 and with 
themselves with energies E{ and E"2. Such a model has proved to be 
intractable. Therefore, we consider the following modification of On-
sager's lattice, which may be studied analytically and still embodies the 
essential feature of destroying some of the translational symmetry of 
the system. We retain the features of Onsager's rectangular lattice to the 
extent that all horizontal interactions are the same and that the vertical 
interaction E2(j) between any site in the ;'th row and its nearest neighbor 
in the ( j + l)th row is the same no matter what column these sites are in. 
However, E2(j) is allowed to vary randomly from row to row. More 
specifically, we assume that, for j 
j', E2(j) and E2(J') are independent 
random variables with identical probability distributions P(E2) dE2. 
Let us try to describe the model in greater detail. We are considering a 
collection of Ising lattices, each of which is specified by a particular set 
of interactions {E2(j)}. We are interested in the thermodynamic limit 
where the size of these lattices becomes infinite. If, in the thermodynamic 
limit, the free energy of each lattice in our collection varied wildly from 
lattice to lattice our model would be useless. In that case the free energy 
of our random lattices would depend in detail on the arrangement of 
interactions. Fortunately, this is physically unreasonable and, indeed, 
will be seen in Sec. 2 not to be the case. In the thermodynamic limit the 
free energy per site of each lattice does approach, with probability 1, the 
same value. Therefore, with probability 1 the Curie temperatures of any 
two lattices from this collection are the same. Furthermore, we expect 
the spontaneous magnetization of any two lattices to be the same with 
probability 1, because the spontaneous magnetization, like the free energy,

is an average property of the entire lattice. However, not all quantities of 
interest have distributions which are so sharply peaked. For example, the 
spin-spin correlation function of neighboring spins does depend in detail 
on the local value of the interaction energies. For such quantities one 
needs more than an average value to characterize the result of a measure-
ment made at an arbitrary position in the impure lattice. 
The complete investigation of all aspects of this random Ising model 
has not been made. In this chapter we begin the investigation by con-
sidering the free energy in the absence of a magnetic field.2 In Sec. 2 we 
will formulate the mathematical problem to be solved and find a general 
formula for the critical temperature in terms of P(E2)· In Sec. 3 we will 
derive several general properties of the integral equation found in Sec. 2. 
There is a great deal that can be said about the equations we derive because 
they depend on the arbitrary function P(E2). We wish to emphasize the 
physical consequences of random impurities. Therefore we specialize 
our treatment in Sec. 4 to a particular distribution P(E2) which has a 
narrow width (of order N ' 1 ) 3 that is particularly mathematically tract-
able. This distribution is in no way physically distinguished and our 
results are expected to be typical of a large class of narrow distributions. 
We show that, whereas the critical temperature is shifted by a temperature 
of the order of N ' 1 , the specific heat deviates appreciably (to order 1 as 
Ν ^ co) from Onsager's specific heat only for Τ — Tc ~ 0(N~2). 
We 
furthermore find that at Tc the term of order 1 in the specific heat is not 
logarithmically divergent but is an infinitely differentiable function of Τ 
though it is not analytic. Finally we conclude in Sec. 5 with a discussion 
of several of the technical aspects of the calculation and of the relation 
of this computation to the experimental situation.

the presence of a magnetic field. However, as this study says nothing about phase 
transitions, we will not discuss it here. For details see C. Fan and B. McCoy, Phys. 
Rev. 182, 614 (1969).

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
The general theory of such random matrix products, in particular the 
existence with probability 1 of the limit of the right-hand side of (2.11), 
has been presented in a rigorous manner by Furstenberg.5 
We begin our evaluation of (2.11) by noting that 
lim J t - X \ n C A 0 ) = lim 
Τ 
(2.14) 
By means of the recursion relation (2.9) this may be rewritten as

This can be interpreted as an average over n. The only drawback is that, 
whereas the λ(η) are independent random variables, the DJCn are not at 
all independent. We now remark that, because the matrix (2.12) is real 
and acts on a two-dimensional vector space, 
= CJDn 
(2.16) 
may be thought of as the tangent of the angle which the vector 
makes with the D-axis. From (2.9) we find 
(a2 + b2)xn

αλ(η) 
" + 1 
axn + λ(η) 
Because the space of angular dependence of these vectors is compact, as 
η becomes large the variable xn will approach a limiting stationary dis-
tribution v(x) that is independent of the initial vector.6 This stationary 
distribution is characterized by the property that, if we apply a random 
matrix (2.12) to it and average the resulting distribution over /¿(λ) of 
(2.13), v(x) will transform into itself. Therefore v(x) satisfies the equation

(2.19) 
The work of Furstenberg5 guarantees that a solution to this equation 
exists and that if μ(λ) is not δ(λ — A) this solution is unique. 
Once we possess a stationary distribution v(x) we may replace the 
average over η in (2.15) by an average over λ and over x. We thus arrive

Since Cjt and Djt are the components of the same vector, their average

We now use the integral equation (2.19) on the first term of (2.26) to find 
that, as expected, d = 0. 
We may readily derive the expression for the critical temperature Tc in 
terms of P(E2) if we note that at a = 0 the matrix (2.12) is diagonal. The 
only possible stationary distributions of vectors are those with the vectors

The free energy is related to the larger of these two expressions and the

(2.290) 
If P(E2) = 8(E2 - El), then (2.29) reads 
^

(2.30) 
which is the known result for Τ — Tc in the ferromagnetic Onsager lattice. 
The correctness of this criterion for locating Tc will be seen more explicitly 
in Sec. 4, where we demonstrate for a specific μ(λ) that at the Tc given by 
(2.29) the free energy Fr is not an analytic function of the temperature. 
We note that (2.29) has the property that Tc is zero if P(E2) = 
pS(E2) 
Η 
, where 0 < ρ < 1. This is to be expected for our model. A 
delta function at E2 = 0 means that in every random lattice there are, 
with probability 1, vertical bonds with zero strength a finite distance 
apart. But for our class of lattices the condition EJJ) — 0 cuts the 
lattice into two separate pieces. Therefore the term pS{E2) 
causes the 
lattice, with probability 1, to be cut up into an infinite number of strips 
of finite width, and any two-dimensional Ising lattice that is not infinite 
in both dimensions has no critical temperature. However, we also note 
that if μ(λ) is bounded near E2 = 0 and El > 0, then Tc is greater than 
zero. 
Finally we remark that the argument leading to (2.29a) does not depend 
on the fact that E2 rather than E1 is random. We therefore see by a 
similar argument that if E1 and E2 are random with the joint probability

3. I N T E G R A L EQUATION FOR v(x) 
In this section we study several general properties of the integral 
equation (2.19). The limits of (2.19) have formally been written as — oo 
to +00, but over much of this range v{x) vanishes identically. To see this, 
first consider the stationary distribution corresponding to the Onsager 
lattice where 
Μλ) = δ(λ - Ä). 
(3.1) 
The stationary angular distribution of vectors will clearly be a delta 
function at that value of χ which is unchanged by the application of the 
matrix (2.12) with λ = λ. From (2.17) we see that the values of χ which 
satisfy this eigenvector equation obey 
which is also usefully expressed as 
*o(A) - a 
(3.2« 
There are two solutions to (3.2) because the matrix (2.12) has two eigen-
values. To obtain the correct free energy we must choose that solution 
which has the larger eigenvalue. It may easily be seen from (2.12) or 
from (2.20) and (2.21) that the correct solution of (3.2) is 
*0(A) = (1/2α){α2 + b2 - Α + [(β2 + b2 - λ)2 + 4Xa2]112}, 
(3.3a) 
with 
jc^A)-1 = (l/2aA){—(a2 + b2 - A) + [(a2 + b2 - A)2 + 4Aa2]1'2}. 
(3.3b) 
If we use (3.1) and (3.3) in (2.21) we find that the free energy for Onsager's 
lattice is 
- β F a = In (2 cosh ßEt cosh βE2)

which agrees with (V.3.6).

T W O - D I M E N S I O N A L

From (3.3) we see that the eigenvector of the matrix (2.12) with the 
larger eigenvalue always lies in the range 
ex0(l) < ax < axo(0) = a2 + b2. 
Consider any vector not in this range. Pick any matrix of the form (2.12) 
with Ä not equal to 0 or 1 such that the eigenvector with the smaller 
eigenvalue does not lie in the direction of this vector. If we apply this 
matrix to the vector sufficiently many times, the resultant vector will lie 
inside (3.5). But this is true not only if all the matrices correspond to λ 
but also if the matrices correspond to λ's lying in some neighborhood of 
Ä. Therefore there is a nonzero probability that after the application of 
(2.12) a finite number of times on a given vector the resultant vector will 
lie in the range (3.5). Furthermore, it is clear from (2.17) and (3.2) that if 
xn satisfies (3.5) then * n + 1 does also. Therefore we conclude that no

distribution of vectors that does not vanish outside the range ax0(\) < 
ax < (a2 + b2) can be stationary. 
In fact the same argument shows that, if 
μ(Χ) ξ 0 unless 
λό < λ < λ0, 
then 
ν(χ) = 0 unless αχ0(λ0) < αχ < αχ0(λ'0). 
To see what restriction (3.7) puts on the limits of integration in (2.19), 
it is convenient to plot in Fig. 14.1, for a > 0, (1) the region in the 
x-x'-plane where the kernel of (2.19) is not zero; (2) the contours along 
which μ[χ'(α2 + b2 — ax)l(x — β)] is constant; and (3) the region where 
v(x) and v(x') are different from zero. We then readily see that (2.19)

An important difference between the Onsager lattice and all random 
lattices may be seen from Fig. 14.1. If μ(λ) = δ(λ — A), then, as we have 
seen earlier, v(x) is given by a delta function at that value of χ that lies 
within the interval (3.5) where the curve χ' = A(x — α)/(α2 + b2 — αχ) 
intersects the line χ = χ'. This intersection is at the point ;c0(A) given by 
(3.3). There are three distinct cases: 
(a) if ί>(0)2 > A(T > Tc) then as θ -> 0 
χ0β) ~ [¿(O)2 - A ya; 
(3.10α) 
(b) if ¿(O)2 < Α(Γ < Tc) then as 0 ^ 0

(3.106) 
(c) if b{Ο)2 = Α(Γ = Tc) then as θ 
0 
x0(A) 
± A1'2. 
(3.10c) 
We see from (3.10) that a delta-function distribution of λ leads to a 
delta-function stationary distribution. In the limit θ ->-0, the delta-
function stationary distribution remains at a finite value of χ if Τ — Tc 
but moves to zero (or infinity) if Τ is less than (or greater than) Tc. 
Contrast this case with the case of a very narrow μ(λ). As long as a is 
sufficiently far away from zero a narrow /χ(λ) must give rise to a corre-
spondingly narrow v(jc) because the projection on the x-axis of the region 
of the χ = x' line where the kernel of (3.8) is appreciably different from 
zero is small. However, if θ gets close enough to zero and Τ is such that 
μ(λ) is different from zero in the region (however small) where λ ~ b{0)2, 
then the above-mentioned projection on the x-axis becomes enormous. 
This dramatic broadening of v(x) when Τ ~ Tc and θ ~ 0 will be 
exploited in the next section to obtain the dominant contribution to the 
specific heat for the particular narrow distribution 
μ(λ) = Νλ ¿-"λ"-1 
(3.11) 
for 0 < λ < λ0 = tanh2 βΕ%. If λ is outside this range, μ(λ) = 0. 
The foregoing discussion, however, shows that there is nothing particular 
about this form of μ(λ), and we expect that the physical properties which 

[357] 
RANDOM ISING MODEL: SPECIFIC 
HEAT 
(3.11) leads to will be qualitatively the same for a wide class of narrow 
distributions. 
Before studying the power-law distribution (3.11) in detail, we find it 
convenient to perform some manipulations on (3.8a) which are useful 
for any μ(λ) such that μ(λ) = 0 if λ > λ0. We first note that it is possible

In this section we determine the dominant contribution to the specific 
heat of the lattice characterized by the power-law distribution (3.11). 
We consider only the case of large Ν and ignore all contributions to the 
specific heat which vanish as TV—> co. Then the discussion of Sec. 3 
shows that when a is away from zero v(x) is given by a narrow distribution 
which will differ but little from the v(x) of an Onsager problem. We are 
not interested in these small deviations and concentrate our attention on 
the opposite extreme, when a is close to zero. From (2.29a) we find that 
Τ = Tc if 
In [ft(0)aAo1] = In J?2(0) = - N ~ \ 
(4.1) 
When B2 is close to this value and a ~ 0, the discussion of Sec. 3 shows 
that ν(χ) is very broad. Therefore when χ is of order 1, v(x), and hence 
U(τ), may be treated as slowly varying. Furthermore, (4.1) shows that 
the region of integration of (3.28) is of the order of Ν _1. Hence to leading 
order in N ' 1 we may expand 
U(r') ~ U(r) + (τ' - r)U'(r) 
(4.2) 
and carry out the integration in (3.28) to obtain the approximate dif-
ferential equation

This approximation to Χ(η) forms the basis of all further considerations 
of this section. 
To give insight into the structure of X(r¡) we first remark that as 
N-+CO the power-law distribution (3.11) approaches δ(λ — λ0). There-
fore when Τ φ Tc and θ Φ 0 we find that the exact 
must approach 
8(x — xQ) as Ν->• oo, and hence X(r¡) must approach 8(17). Our approxi-
mation to X{rj) was derived under the assumption that Τ — Tc and θ 
were small and hence it is not obvious that (4.6) will approach 8(r¡) as 
N-*· co. To see that this is in fact the case we note that the maximum of 
ηΧ(η) is reached at 
Vm = (l/2r)[—í + (*2 + 4tu)112] 
(4.7a) 
and its width (in the sense of a steepest-descent integral) is 
rô'2 
(2u - sVmy<* 
If Τ Φ Tc and 0 ^ 0 are fixed and Ν-> oo, í = -2(ln B2)'1

0{N~l), 
t = OiN-1), 
and u = O ^ " 1 ) so that Vm = 0(N~l) 
and u>„ = 
OiN'1). 
Therefore X(r¡) -> &(r¡ — ηη) in the sense that in evaluating the normali-
zation integral of Χ(η) we may replace X{rj) by 8(17 — ηη). 
We are interested in the contributions of order 1 to the specific heat 
when Ν is large. This is found by using our approximation for Χ(η) in 
the integral (2.20), which in terms of η is

When Τ φ Tc and θ φ 0 are fixed and TV

f ( v ) = In [a2 + b2 + αλ/χο] +

Therefore our approximation Χ(η) may be replaced by &(η — r¡m) for the 
purpose of obtaining the leading-order term of (4.8). This is the behavior 
expected of the exact X(r¡) in this limit, so we conclude that approxima-
tion (4.6) may be used for all Τ and θ for the purpose of obtaining the 
leading-order term in the specific heat when TV-9- 00.

In fact, for our limited purpose, Χ(η) is well approximated by 
— ηη) 
not only when Τ Φ Tc and θ Φ 0 are fixed and Ν ^ co but also when a 
is of the order of N~ e and 6(0)2 — λ0 is of the order of N ' y , where 
0 < e < 1 and 0 < γ < 1. There are three cases to be considered: 
(α) γ > e; (b) γ < £ and ¿(O)2 - λ0 < 0 ;(c) γ < * and ¿(O)2 - λ0 > 0. 
We find 
(a) Vm = 0(N ""1+E), h>„ = 0(N 
1+E'2), /(η) = In b2 + 0(N *)·, 
(b) r¡m = OC/V-1-2^3"),

0(N~y); 
(c) Vm = 0(N-1+>), 
w„ = 0(Ν-ί+·"2),/(η) 
= \nb2 + 
0(N-*<+'). 
Since the variations in /(η) caused by deviations in η of the order of w„ 
vanish as Ν -»• oo, we conclude that in these cases for our purpose Χ(η) 
may be replaced by 8(η — ηπ). 
Because of the fact that even if Τ ~ Tc the contribution of v(x) — 
S(x — xm) to the specific heat is very small for \a\ » N~x, it is useful to 
consider the contributions of δ(χ — xm) and 
— δ(χ — xm) separately. 
It is easily seen that xm obeys 
xla[ 1 +b-2G]- 
xm[a2 + b2 - A0 + G(1 + 2a2b~2)]

By comparing Fr with the Onsager free energy F0 of (3.4) we conclude

(4.12) 
which is exactly the same equation for Tc as (4.1). Therefore over the 
range of Τ in which v(x) is well approximated by S(x — xm), F, is domin-
ated by a term which has an apparent logarithmic divergence at Tc. 
To study the behavior very near Tc we write 
Fr - Fr ~ 
J" 
J"° dxHx) - S(x - xm)] In (a2 + b2 + a\0¡x), 
(4.13) 
where the λ integral has been evaluated to 0{N~V). We consider only Τ 
close enough to Tc that b2 — λ0 < 0. The ~ sign is to mean that both 
sides lead to the same specific heat to order 1 as N-+ oo. Furthermore we 
have seen that unless a2 + b2 — A0 = 0(jV _ 1) we cannot have a con-
tribution of order 1 to (4.13). Therefore axö1 = 0(ΛΓ_1) and, since

(4.14) 
To evaluate this approximately to order 1 we need to find the correct 
range of β, η, and Τ — Tc. We have previously considered the case 
α » Ν ' 1 and |b2 — λ0| » Ν ' 1 and seen via a steepest-descent integra-
tion that the contribution is negligible. In a similar fashion we may show 
that the cases (1) α is of order N'1, 
(2) a = o(N ~ x) and s = o(N) give 
only contributions of order N ' 1 to the specific heat. The only region 
that gives a contribution of order 1 to the specific heat as N-> oo is 
a = 0(N~2) and Τ — Tc — 0(N~2). 
When Τ - T c = 0(N~2) 
and a = 0(N~2), 
X(v) and S(v - Vm) do 
not cancel at all so that Fr and F, must be evaluated separately. Because 
c1 = — TF"(T) is to leading order in Ν the same as Onsager's specific heat, 
we may use (V.3.119) to find

where gd stands for the gudermannian [gd χ = tan ~ 1 sinh x], the sub-
script c means Τ = Tc, and z\c = tanh ßcE%. 
We evaluate cr by splitting the θ integration into two regions, one for 
0 < θ < 0(N~2) 
and the other for θ » N~2. 
In the second region the 
integrand of (4.14) is small. Therefore to leading order the parts of cr and 
¿Γ coming from angular integration over this second region are equal. It 
is easily seen that the large angles give a contribution to cr that is con-
stant. The point of separation between the two regions is not well defined 
but, as will shortly be verified, the precise choice of this cut off does not 
affect the temperature-dependent part of c' but only the constant. 
Therefore we may evaluate the leading contribution to cr as JV 
oo 
when Τ — Tc = 0(N~2) 
up to a constant by integrating θ only up to 
0(N~2). 
We then may determine the constant by the requirement that, 
when Τ — Tc » Ν ~ 2 , cT ~ cr, where cr is given by (4.15).

The specific heat (4.40) has been calculated for the random lattice 
characterized by μ(λ) given by (3.11). The corresponding probability 
density P(E2) is

(4.41) 
for 0 < E2 < E°. This probability clearly depends on temperature. The 
probabilities envisioned in the original statement of the model were to be 
temperature independent. Fortunately, because the only significant devia-
tion of cT from c' occurs when Τ — 
T c = 
0(N~2), 
we see that in the 
temperature range where (4.40) is valid 
P(E2) 
= jSc(l - tanh2/3c£a)2W(tanh £2°/Sc)" 2N(tanh jSc£2)2N-1 [1 + 0(Ν~1)].

Therefore P(E2) as given by (4.42) differs, when Τ — Tc = 0(N~2), from 
a temperature-independent probability by a term of 0(N ~*), which is 
negligible. 
To justify calling the temperature given by the solution of (4.1) the 
critical temperature we must show that cT as given by (4.40) is not 
analytic at δ = 0. For this purpose we integrate the integral in (4.40) by

near φ = 0. Thus we may obtain the most singular behavior of (4.43) if 
we integrate only from 0 to some small upper limit e and expand for φ 
and δ near zero :

We have been able to replace « by 1 in (4.44) because the integrand is 
regular at φ = 1. It is easily seen that /(δ) — /(— δ) = δ, so we need 
consider only δ > 0. Then if we let

Here B2n are the Bernoulli numbers defined by (XI.4.39). Therefore the

(4.50) 
Thus (4.49) diverges for all δ Φ 0 so cT is not an analytic function of Τ 
at Τ = Tc. It is therefore correct to call Tc as determined from (4.1) the 
critical temperature. 
Finally, it is useful to supplement these analytic considerations with a 
numerical evaluation of cr when Τ - Tc = 0(N~2). 
We present the 
results in Figs. 14.2 and 14.3.

The principal result of this chapter is to exhibit an Ising model with 
random impurities where, to order 1, the specific heat is an infinitely 
differentiable function of the temperature even at Tc. This smooth 
behavior of C is in beautiful qualitative agreement with precise measure-
ments near the Curie (or Néal) temperature Tc which have been made, 
for example, on EuS, NiRbMnF3, and dysprosium aluminum garnet.11 In 
other ferromagnetic (and antiferromagnetic) materials, c appears to 
diverge at some temperature Tc if measurements are made for | Τ — Tc\ > 
10"3. However, if Tis sufficiently close to Tc, the specific heats deviate 
drastically from a diverging function (or even a function with an infinite 
first derivative at Tc) and are observed to be quite smooth at Tc. Although 
there is yet no conclusive evidence that this "smoothing out" of the 
diverging specific heat is due to random impurities and not to long-range 
forces or finite volume effects, we feel justified in proposing that random 
impurities can be the origin of these effects. In fact, the specific heat 
computed in this chapter is of the form 
Cl[Ä(8) + c2 - In w2], 
(5.1) 
where 
δ = - (1 - TITc)lw*. 
(5.2) 
If we choose cx = 4.13 J/mole deg, c2 = —1.30, and w = 2.68 χ 10~2, 
we find (Fig. 14.4) that some of these experimental data are in beautiful 
quantitative agreement with (5.1). 
On the other hand, this particular model of random impurities is 
obviously artificial. It is not realistic to assume that all vertical bonds 
E2(j) in a given row will be equal if we are allowing E2(j) to vary from 
row to row. A realistic model of random impurities should not have such

a large amount of correlation between the random bonds. For this 
reason, we are extremely fortunate that the specific heat found in Sec. 4 
is infinitely differentiable. If random impurities had increased the 
observed order of the phase transition to a higher but finite order, the 
question could very reasonably be asked whether relaxation of this very 
stringent correlation requirement would further increase the observed 
order. However, even the limited amount of randomness allowed in this 
model has made the dominant contribution to all derivatives of the 
specific heat continuous, so no further increase of the observed order is 
possible. 
We are unable to ascertain which of the results of this chapter are 
qualitatively dependent on the very special sort of randomness allowed 
in our model. For example, we find that if the impurities have a narrow 
width of order Ν _ 1, there is an effect of order 1 on the specific heat only 
when IΤ - Tc\ = 0(N~2). 
We do not know whether this order of 
magnitude persists in general. 
It must be emphasized that in this computation of the observed

(order 1) specific heat we have in no way settled the question of the order 
of the phase transition. To answer this question, which admittedly is not 
very important physically, one must study the analytic behavior of all 
contributions to cr. There are several reasons why this is not trivial. We 
mention two : 
(1) The relation of the differential equation (4.3) to the integral 
equation (3.28) must be studied in detail. The naïve procedure of using 
more terms in the Taylor series expansion of U(j) leaves one with a 
differential equation of order larger than 1 and the problem of deter-
mining the boundary conditions must be resolved. 
(2) Formally, it is possible to write down an exact iterative solution 
to the integral equation (3.28). This iterative solution is analytic only in 
the segments B2n < η < 52<n_1). The approximation employed in Sec. 4 
approximates the analytic function which this segmented solution 
approaches when n -> oo. This is the important region for the order-1 
contributions to cr, but in general the effects (if any) of the segmented 
nature of the exact solution are not understood.
